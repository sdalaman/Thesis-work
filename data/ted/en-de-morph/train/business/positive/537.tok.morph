i	'm	not	at	all	a	cook	.
so	do	n't	fear	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	going	to	be	a	 cook 	 ing 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 	.
but	i	do	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	think	is	dear	to	all	of	us	.
and	that	is	bread	--	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	 a 	 s 	 	simple	 a 	 s 	 	our	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	most	fundamental	human	staple	.
and	i	think	few	of	us	 s 	 pend 	 	the	day	 with 	 out 	 	eating	bread	in	some	form	.
 un 	 less 	 	you	're	on	one	of	these	californian	low	-	carb	 diet 	 s 	 	,	bread	is	standard	.
bread	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	standard	in	the	western	diet	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	will	show	to	you	,	it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 main 	 stay 	 	of	modern	life	.
so	i	'm	going	to	bake	bread	for	you	.
in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	,	so	my	life	is	going	to	 complic 	 ated 	 	.	bear	with	me	.
first	of	all	,	a	little	bit	of	audience	 particip 	 ation 	 	.
i	have	two	 lo 	 ave 	 s 	 	of	bread	here	.
one	is	a	 super 	 market 	 	standard	:	white	bread	,	pre	-	 package 	 d 	 	,	which	i	'm	told	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	wonderbread	.
i	did	n't	know	 th 	 is 	 	word	 un 	 til 	 	i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	more	or	less	,	a	whole	-	meal	,	 hand 	 made 	 	,	small	-	 bake 	 ry 	 	loaf	of	bread	.
here	we	go	.	i	want	to	see	a	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	.
who	 prefer 	 s 	 	the	whole	-	meal	bread	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	let	me	do	 th 	 is 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.	is	 any 	 body 	 	 prefer 	 ring 	 	the	wonderbread	at	all	?
i	have	two	 tent 	 ative 	 	male	 hand 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	the	question	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	so	?
and	i	think	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	feel	that	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	bread	 re 	 ally 	 	is	about	 authentic 	 ity 	 	.
it	's	about	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	way	of	living	.
a	way	that	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	real	,	more	honest	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	from	tuscany	,	where	we	feel	 agricultur 	 e 	 	is	still	about	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
and	life	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	too	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	good	taste	,	good	 tradition 	 s 	 	.
why	do	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	image	?
why	do	we	feel	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	more	true	than	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	i	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	do	with	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
in	the	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	since	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	most	of	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 agricultur 	 alist 	 s 	 	or	they	 we 	 re 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	related	to	food	production	.
and	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 myth 	 ical 	 	image	of	how	life	was	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	in	the	past	.
art	 ha 	 s 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	us	to	maintain	that	kind	of	image	.
it	was	a	 myth 	 ical 	 	past	.
of	course	,	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
these	poor	 farm 	 ers 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	the	land	by	hand	or	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	had	yield	 level 	 s 	 	that	are	 compar 	 able 	 	to	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	 to 	 day 	 	in	west	africa	.
but	we	have	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	in	the	course	of	the	last	few	centuries	,	or	even	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	an	image	of	a	 myth 	 ical 	 	,	 r 	 ural 	 	 agricultur 	 al 	 	past	.
it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	we	had	the	 ad 	 vent 	 	of	the	industrial	revolution	.
and	while	i	'm	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	some	bread	for	you	here	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	what	that	revolution	did	to	us	.
it	 br 	 ought 	 	us	power	.	it	 br 	 ought 	 	us	 mechan 	 ization 	 	,	 fertil 	 izer 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	drove	up	our	 yield 	 s 	 	.
and	even	sort	of	 horr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	 pick 	 ing 	 	 bean 	 s 	 	by	hand	,	can	now	be	 d 	 one 	 	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
all	that	is	a	real	,	great	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 s 	 hall 	 	see	.
of	course	we	 al 	 so 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	the	last	decade	,	 manage 	 d 	 	to	envelop	the	world	in	a	dense	chain	of	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	,	in	a	chain	of	global	trade	.
and	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	now	eat	 product 	 s 	 	,	which	can	come	from	all	around	the	world	.
that	is	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	our	modern	life	.
now	you	may	prefer	 th 	 is 	 	loaf	of	bread	.
excuse	my	 hand 	 s 	 	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	is	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	real	relevant	bread	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	white	wonder	loaf	.
and	do	n't	 despis 	 e 	 	the	white	bread	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	,	i	think	,	 symbol 	 ize 	 s 	 	the	fact	that	bread	and	food	have	 be 	 come 	 	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	and	 afford 	 able 	 	to	all	.
and	that	is	a	feat	that	we	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	conscious	of	that	much	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	bread	that	is	 taste 	 less 	 	in	some	ways	and	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	.
so	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
well	the	best	way	to	look	at	that	is	to	do	a	 tin 	 y 	 	bit	of	 simpl 	 istic 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
with	the	 ad 	 vent 	 	of	the	industrial	revolution	with	 modern 	 ization 	 	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	in	the	last	few	 decade 	 s 	 	,	since	the	1960s	,	food	 avail 	 ability 	 	,	per	head	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	by	25	percent	.
and	the	world	population	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 double 	 d 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	have	now	more	food	 avail 	 able 	 	than	ever	before	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	that	is	the	result	,	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	of	 be 	 ing 	 	so	 success 	 ful 	 	at	increasing	the	scale	and	volume	of	our	production	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	for	all	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	our	bread	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	?
 a 	 s 	 	food	 be 	 came 	 	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	here	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 de 	 crease 	 	the	number	of	people	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	on	average	,	in	the	high	income	 count 	 ries 	 	,	five	percent	or	less	of	the	population	.
in	the	u.s.	 on 	 ly 	 	one	percent	of	the	people	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
and	it	 free 	 s 	 	us	all	up	to	do	other	 thing 	 s 	 	--	to	 s 	 it 	 	at	ted	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	not	to	worry	about	our	food	.
that	is	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
never	before	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	feed	the	world	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	so	few	people	.
and	never	before	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	 be 	 en 	 	 obliv 	 ious 	 	of	that	fact	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	food	 be 	 came 	 	more	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	,	bread	 be 	 came 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 came 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	,	bread	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	add	in	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	 add 	 ed 	 	in	more	sugar	.
we	add	in	 raisin 	 s 	 	and	oil	and	milk	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	make	bread	,	from	a	simple	food	 in 	 to 	 	kind	of	a	support	for	 calorie 	 s 	 	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	bread	now	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	.
it	is	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	most	fundamental	food	that	we	've	had	in	the	last	ten	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	.
wheat	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	crop	--	the	first	crop	we	 domestic 	 ated 	 	and	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	crop	we	still	grow	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	 th 	 is 	 	strange	 concoct 	 ion 	 	of	high	 calorie 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	true	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	it	is	true	all	over	the	world	.
bread	 ha 	 s 	 	 migr 	 ated 	 	to	 tropic 	 al 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	where	the	middle	 class 	 es 	 	now	eat	french	 roll 	 s 	 	and	 ham 	 burger 	 s 	 	and	where	the	 commute 	 rs 	 	find	bread	much	more	 hand 	 y 	 	to	use	than	rice	or	 cass 	 a 	 va 	 	.
so	bread	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	from	a	main	staple	,	a	source	of	 calorie 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 obes 	 ity 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	a	source	of	 modern 	 ity 	 	,	of	modern	life	.
and	the	 white 	 r 	 	the	bread	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	better	it	is	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	story	of	bread	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	now	.
but	of	course	the	price	of	mass	production	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	we	 move 	 d 	 	large	-	scale	.
and	large	-	scale	 ha 	 s 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	--	still	a	 lone 	 ly 	 	 e 	 mu 	 	here	in	the	brazilian	cerrado	soybean	 field 	 s 	 	.
the	 cost 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	tremendous	--	water	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	know	about	,	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	our	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	.
what	we	need	to	do	is	to	go	back	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	our	food	is	about	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	have	to	 que 	 ry 	 	all	of	you	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	tell	wheat	 a 	 part 	 	from	other	 ce 	 real 	 s 	 	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	make	a	bread	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	 with 	 out 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	with	a	bread	machine	or	just	some	kind	of	 package 	 d 	 	flavor	?
can	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	bake	bread	?	do	you	know	how	much	a	loaf	of	bread	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	?
we	have	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	what	our	bread	 re 	 ally 	 	is	,	which	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 evolution 	 arily 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	.
in	fact	not	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	that	our	bread	,	of	course	,	was	not	a	european	 invent 	 ion 	 	.
it	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	syria	in	 part 	 icular 	 	.
the	 tin 	 y 	 	spike	on	the	left	to	the	center	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 fore 	 father 	 	of	wheat	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	it	all	 come 	 s 	 	from	,	and	where	these	 farm 	 ers 	 	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	ten	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	put	us	on	the	road	of	bread	.
now	it	is	not	surprising	that	with	 th 	 is 	 	 mass 	 ification 	 	and	large	-	scale	production	,	there	is	a	counter	-	 move 	 ment 	 	that	 emerge 	 d 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 al 	 so 	 	here	in	california	.
the	counter	-	 move 	 ment 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	let	's	go	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
let	's	go	back	to	 tradition 	 al 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	.
let	's	go	back	to	small	-	scale	,	to	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	 market 	 s 	 	,	small	 bake 	 ries 	 	and	all	that	.	``	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
do	n't	we	all	agree	?	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	agree	.
i	would	love	to	go	back	to	tuscany	to	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	setting	,	 g 	 astro 	 nomy 	 	,	good	food	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fall 	 acy 	 	.
and	the	 fall 	 acy 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	 ideal 	 izing 	 	a	past	that	we	have	 for 	 gotten 	 	about	.
if	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	we	want	to	stay	with	 tradition 	 al 	 	small	-	scale	 farm 	 ing 	 	we	are	going	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	relegate	these	poor	 farm 	 ers 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 husband 	 s 	 	--	among	whom	i	have	lived	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	and	water	,	to	try	to	improve	 the 	 ir 	 	food	production	--	we	relegate	them	to	poverty	.
what	they	want	are	 implement 	 s 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	production	:	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 fertil 	 ize 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	to	protect	 the 	 ir 	 	crop	and	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	a	market	.
we	can	not	just	think	that	small	-	scale	is	the	solution	to	the	world	food	problem	.
it	's	a	 luxur 	 y 	 	solution	for	us	who	can	afford	it	,	if	you	want	to	afford	it	.
in	fact	we	do	not	want	 th 	 is 	 	poor	woman	to	work	the	land	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	we	say	just	small	-	scale	production	,	 a 	 s 	 	is	the	 tend 	 ency 	 	here	,	to	go	back	to	local	food	 mean 	 s 	 	that	a	poor	man	like	hans	rosling	can	not	even	eat	 o 	 range 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	in	scandinavia	we	do	n't	have	 o 	 range 	 s 	 	.
so	local	food	production	is	out	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	we	do	not	want	to	relegate	to	poverty	in	the	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
and	we	do	not	want	to	relegate	the	urban	poor	to	 starv 	 ation 	 	.
so	we	must	find	other	 solution 	 s 	 	.
one	of	our	 problem 	 s 	 	is	that	world	food	production	 need 	 s 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	--	 doub 	 ling 	 	by	about	2030	.
the	main	driver	of	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	meat	.
and	meat	consumption	in	 south 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	 chin 	 a 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	is	what	 drive 	 s 	 	the	 price 	 s 	 	of	 ce 	 real 	 s 	 	.
that	need	for	animal	protein	is	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	.
we	can	discuss	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	talk	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	one	day	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	 driv 	 ing 	 	force	.
so	what	can	we	do	?
can	we	find	a	solution	to	produce	more	?
 y 	 es 	 	.	but	we	need	 mechan 	 ization 	 	.
and	i	'm	making	a	real	 ple 	 a 	 	here	.
i	feel	so	 strong 	 ly 	 	that	you	can	not	ask	a	small	 farm 	 er 	 	to	work	the	land	and	bend	over	to	grow	a	hectare	of	rice	,	150,000	 time 	 s 	 	,	just	to	plant	a	crop	and	weed	it	.
you	can	not	ask	people	to	work	under	these	 condition 	 s 	 	.
we	need	clever	low	-	key	 mechan 	 ization 	 	that	 avoid 	 s 	 	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	the	large	-	scale	 mechan 	 ization 	 	that	we	've	had	.
so	what	can	we	do	?
we	must	feed	three	billion	people	in	cities	.
we	will	not	do	that	through	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	 market 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	these	people	have	no	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	 market 	 s 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 dispos 	 al 	 	.
they	have	low	 income 	 s 	 	.	and	they	benefit	from	cheap	,	 afford 	 able 	 	,	safe	and	 divers 	 e 	 	food	.
that	's	what	we	must	aim	for	in	the	next	20	to	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	 y 	 es 	 	there	are	some	 solution 	 s 	 	.
and	let	me	just	do	one	simple	conceptual	thing	:	if	i	plot	science	 a 	 s 	 	a	 pr 	 oxy 	 	for	control	of	the	production	process	and	scale	.
what	you	see	is	that	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	in	the	left	-	hand	corner	with	 tradition 	 al 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	which	was	sort	of	small	-	scale	and	low	-	control	.
we	've	 move 	 d 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	large	-	scale	and	 ver 	 y 	 	high	control	.
what	i	want	us	to	do	is	to	keep	up	the	science	and	even	get	more	science	in	there	but	go	to	a	kind	of	 region 	 al 	 	scale	--	not	just	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	scale	of	the	 field 	 s 	 	,	but	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	entire	food	network	.
that	's	where	we	should	move	.
and	the	ultimate	may	be	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 app 	 ly 	 	to	 ce 	 real 	 s 	 	,	that	we	have	 entire 	 ly 	 	closed	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	--	the	 horti 	 cultural 	 	 system 	 s 	 	right	at	the	top	left	-	hand	corner	.
so	we	need	to	think	 different 	 ly 	 	about	 agricultur 	 e 	 	science	.
 agricultur 	 e 	 	science	for	most	people	--	and	there	are	not	 man 	 y 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	among	you	here	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	name	of	 be 	 ing 	 	bad	,	of	 be 	 ing 	 	about	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	about	large	-	scale	,	about	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	environment	.
that	is	not	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
we	need	more	science	and	not	less	.	and	we	need	good	science	.
so	what	kind	of	science	can	we	have	?
well	first	of	all	i	think	we	can	do	much	better	on	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
use	 bio 	 technology 	 	where	 use 	 ful 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	pest	and	disease	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	who	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 weed 	 s 	 	with	a	 re 	 solution 	 	of	half	an	inch	.
we	have	much	 clever 	 er 	 	 irrig 	 ation 	 	.
we	do	not	need	to	 s 	 pill 	 	the	water	if	we	do	n't	want	to	.
and	we	need	to	think	 ver 	 y 	 	 dis 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	about	the	 compar 	 ative 	 	 advantage 	 s 	 	of	small	-	scale	and	large	-	scale	.
we	need	to	think	that	land	is	multi	-	functional	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	different	 function 	 s 	 	.
there	are	different	ways	in	which	we	must	use	it	--	for	 resident 	 ial 	 	,	for	nature	,	for	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	re	-	examine	 live 	 stock 	 	.
go	 region 	 al 	 	and	go	to	urban	food	 system 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	see	fish	 pond 	 s 	 	in	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 base 	 ments 	 	.
i	want	to	have	 horti 	 culture 	 	and	 green 	 house 	 s 	 	on	top	of	 resident 	 ial 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	to	use	the	energy	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 green 	 house 	 s 	 	and	from	the	 ferment 	 ation 	 	of	 crop 	 s 	 	to	heat	our	 resident 	 ial 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
there	are	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	ways	we	can	do	it	.
we	can	not	solve	the	world	food	problem	by	using	 bio 	 logical 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
but	we	can	do	a	lot	more	.
and	the	main	thing	that	i	would	 re 	 ally 	 	ask	all	of	you	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	back	to	your	 count 	 ries 	 	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	you	stay	here	:	ask	your	government	for	an	 integrate 	 d 	 	food	policy	.
food	is	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	energy	,	 a 	 s 	 	security	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	environment	.
 every 	 thing 	 	is	linked	together	.
so	we	can	do	that	.	in	fact	in	a	 dense 	 ly 	 	 populate 	 d 	 	country	like	the	river	 del 	 ta 	 	,	where	i	live	in	the	netherlands	,	we	have	 combine 	 d 	 	these	 function 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	science	fiction	.	we	can	combine	 thing 	 s 	 	even	in	a	social	sense	of	making	the	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	more	 access 	 ible 	 	to	people	--	to	house	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 chronic 	 ally 	 	sick	.
there	is	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	do	.
but	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	must	do	.	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	for	me	to	say	,	``	let	's	get	more	bold	science	 in 	 to 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.	``
you	must	go	back	and	think	about	your	own	food	chain	.
talk	to	 farm 	 ers 	 	.	when	was	the	last	time	you	went	to	a	farm	and	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	a	 farm 	 er 	 	?
talk	to	people	in	 restaurant 	 s 	 	.
understand	where	you	are	in	the	food	chain	,	where	your	food	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
understand	that	you	are	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	enormous	chain	of	 event 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 free 	 s 	 	you	up	to	do	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	above	all	,	to	me	,	food	is	about	respect	.
it	's	about	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	when	you	eat	,	that	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	who	are	still	in	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	who	are	still	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	food	.
and	the	kind	of	 simpl 	 istic 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	that	we	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	have	,	to	think	that	 do 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	by	hand	is	going	to	be	the	solution	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 moral 	 ly 	 	 just 	 ified 	 	.
we	need	to	help	to	lift	them	out	of	poverty	.
we	need	to	make	them	proud	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 farm 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	allow	us	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
never	before	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	food	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	so	few	.
and	never	before	have	we	had	the	 luxur 	 y 	 	of	taking	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	now	so	cheap	.
and	i	think	there	is	 no 	 body 	 	else	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 express 	 ed 	 	better	,	to	me	,	the	idea	that	food	,	in	the	end	,	in	our	own	tradition	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	holy	.
it	's	not	about	 nutrient 	 s 	 	and	 calorie 	 s 	 	.
it	's	about	sharing	.	it	's	about	 honest 	 y 	 	.	it	's	about	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
who	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	so	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	was	mahatma	gandhi	,	75	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	he	spoke	about	bread	.
he	did	not	speak	about	rice	,	in	india	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	to	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	to	go	 with 	 out 	 	two	 meal 	 s 	 	a	day	,	god	can	 on 	 ly 	 	appear	 a 	 s 	 	bread	.	``
and	so	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 finish 	 ing 	 	my	bread	here	--	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ba 	 king 	 	it	,	and	i	'll	try	not	to	burn	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
let	me	share	with	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	here	in	the	first	row	.
let	me	share	some	of	the	food	with	you	.
take	some	of	my	bread	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	eat	it	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	try	it	--	 pleas 	 e 	 	come	and	stand	up	.
have	some	of	it	.
i	want	you	to	think	that	every	bite	 connect 	 s 	 	you	to	the	past	and	the	future	:	to	these	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	that	first	 br 	 ed 	 	the	first	wheat	 varie 	 ties 	 	;	and	to	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	making	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	you	do	n't	even	know	who	they	are	.
every	meal	you	eat	 contain 	 s 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	from	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
 every 	 thing 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	so	 privilege 	 d 	 	,	that	we	can	eat	 th 	 is 	 	food	,	that	we	do	n't	struggle	every	day	.
and	that	,	i	think	,	 evolution 	 arily 	 	-	 s 	 peaking 	 	is	 un 	 ique 	 	.
we	've	never	had	that	before	.
so	enjoy	your	bread	.
eat	it	,	and	feel	 privilege 	 d 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
