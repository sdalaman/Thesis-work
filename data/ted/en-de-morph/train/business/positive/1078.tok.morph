pat	mitchell	:	what	is	the	story	of	 th 	 is 	 	pin	?
madeleine	albright	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	``	 break 	 ing 	 	the	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.	``
pm	:	oh	.
that	was	well	 chose 	 n 	 	,	i	would	say	,	for	tedwomen	.
ma	:	most	of	the	time	i	 s 	 pend 	 	when	i	get	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	is	going	to	happen	.
and	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	pin	stuff	would	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	if	it	had	n't	 be 	 en 	 	for	saddam	hussein	.
i	'll	tell	you	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	went	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	ambassador	,	and	it	was	after	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	war	,	and	i	was	an	 instruct 	 ed 	 	ambassador	.
and	the	cease	-	fire	had	 be 	 en 	 	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 sanct 	 ions 	 	 re 	 solution 	 s 	 	,	and	my	 instruct 	 ions 	 	 we 	 re 	 	to	say	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	saddam	hussein	 constant 	 ly 	 	,	which	he	 deserve 	 d 	 	--	he	had	 invad 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	country	.
and	so	all	of	a	sudden	,	a	poem	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	the	 paper 	 s 	 	in	baghdad	 compar 	 ing 	 	me	to	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	among	them	an	``	 un 	 parallel 	 ed 	 	 s 	 er 	 pent 	 	.	``
and	so	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	snake	pin	.
so	i	 wo 	 re 	 	it	when	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
and	when	i	went	out	to	meet	the	press	,	they	 zero 	 ed 	 	in	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	are	you	 wear 	 ing 	 	that	snake	pin	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	saddam	hussein	 compar 	 ed 	 	me	to	an	 un 	 parallel 	 ed 	 	 s 	 er 	 pent 	 	.	``
and	then	i	thought	,	well	 th 	 is 	 	is	 f 	 un 	 	.
so	i	went	out	and	i	 b 	 ought 	 	a	lot	of	 pin 	 s 	 	that	would	,	in	fact	,	reflect	what	i	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	do	on	any	 give 	 n 	 	day	.
so	that	's	how	it	all	 start 	 ed 	 	.
pm	:	so	how	large	is	the	 collect 	 ion 	 	?
ma	:	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	.
it	's	now	 travel 	 ing 	 	.
at	the	moment	it	's	in	indianapolis	,	but	it	was	at	the	smithsonian	.
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	with	a	book	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	read	my	 pin 	 s 	 	.	``
pm	:	so	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	good	idea	.
i	remember	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	woman	 a 	 s 	 	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	,	and	there	was	a	lot	of	conversation	 al 	 ways 	 	about	what	you	 we 	 re 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	,	how	you	 look 	 ed 	 	--	the	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	to	a	lot	of	women	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	they	're	the	first	in	a	position	.
so	how	do	you	feel	about	that	--	the	whole	--	ma	:	well	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 irrit 	 ating 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	ever	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	what	a	man	is	 wear 	 ing 	 	.
but	people	did	pay	attention	to	what	 clothe 	 s 	 	i	had	.
what	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	was	that	,	before	i	went	up	to	new	york	 a 	 s 	 	u.n.	ambassador	,	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	jeane	kirkpatrick	,	who	'd	 be 	 en 	 	ambassador	before	me	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	've	got	to	get	rid	of	your	professor	 clothe 	 s 	 	.
go	out	and	look	like	a	diplomat	.	``
so	that	did	give	me	a	lot	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	go	 shop 	 ping 	 	.
but	still	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	about	--	``	did	you	wear	a	hat	?	``	``	how	short	was	your	skirt	?	``
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	--	if	you	remember	condoleezza	rice	was	at	some	event	and	she	 wo 	 re 	 	 boot 	 s 	 	,	and	she	got	 critic 	 ized 	 	over	that	.
and	no	guy	ever	 get 	 s 	 	 critic 	 ized 	 	.	but	that	's	the	 l 	 east 	 	of	it	.
pm	:	it	is	,	for	all	of	us	,	men	and	women	,	 find 	 ing 	 	our	ways	of	 defi 	 ning 	 	our	 role 	 s 	 	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	them	in	ways	that	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	world	and	shape	the	future	.
how	did	you	handle	that	balance	between	 be 	 ing 	 	the	tough	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	and	strong	voice	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	to	the	rest	of	the	world	and	 al 	 so 	 	how	you	felt	about	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	mother	,	a	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	...
and	so	how	did	you	handle	that	?
ma	:	well	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	part	was	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	what	it	was	like	to	be	the	first	woman	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	after	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	named	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	woman	for	60	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	i	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	for	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	.	``
so	it	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	i	love	 be 	 ing 	 	a	woman	.
and	so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	and	i	think	there	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	some	people	in	the	audience	that	will	identify	with	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	went	to	my	first	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	first	at	the	u.n.	,	and	that	's	when	 th 	 is 	 	all	 start 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	male	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	--	there	are	15	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	security	council	--	so	14	men	 s 	 at 	 	there	 star 	 ing 	 	at	me	,	and	i	thought	--	well	you	know	how	we	all	are	.
you	want	to	get	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	the	room	,	and	``	do	people	like	me	?	``
and	``	will	i	 re 	 ally 	 	say	 some 	 thing 	 	intelligent	?	``
and	all	of	a	sudden	i	thought	,	``	well	,	wait	a	minute	.
i	am	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	sign	that	 say 	 s 	 	'	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	'	and	if	i	do	n't	speak	 to 	 day 	 	then	the	voice	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	will	not	be	heard	,	``	and	it	was	the	first	time	that	i	had	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	i	had	to	step	out	of	 my 	 self 	 	in	my	normal	,	 reluct 	 ant 	 	female	mode	and	decide	that	i	had	to	speak	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	our	country	.
and	so	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	more	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	there	was	a	great	advantage	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	to	 be 	 ing 	 	a	woman	.
i	think	we	are	a	lot	better	at	personal	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	and	then	have	the	 cap 	 ability 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	it	like	it	is	when	it	's	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
but	i	have	to	tell	you	,	i	have	my	 young 	 est 	 	 grand 	 daughter 	 	,	when	she	 turn 	 ed 	 	seven	last	year	,	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	mother	,	my	daughter	,	``	so	what	's	the	big	deal	about	grandma	maddie	 be 	 ing 	 	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	?
 on 	 ly 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	are	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	.	``
pm	:	 be 	 cause 	 	in	her	 life 	 time 	 	--	ma	:	that	would	be	so	.
pm	:	what	a	change	that	is	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	travel	now	all	over	the	world	,	which	you	do	 frequent 	 ly 	 	,	how	do	you	assess	 th 	 is 	 	global	narrative	around	the	story	of	women	and	 girl 	 s 	 	?
where	are	we	?
ma	:	i	think	we	're	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	changing	,	but	 obvious 	 ly 	 	there	are	whole	 pocket 	 s 	 	in	 count 	 ries 	 	where	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	different	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	remember	that	,	while	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	have	had	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	--	and	pat	,	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	real	 lead 	 er 	 	in	your	field	--	is	that	there	are	a	lot	of	women	that	are	not	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 worry 	 ing 	 	and	taking	care	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	women	have	to	help	other	women	.
and	so	what	i	have	felt	--	and	i	have	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	from	a	national	security	issue	--	when	i	was	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	women	's	 issue 	 s 	 	had	to	be	central	to	american	foreign	policy	,	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	a	feminist	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 socie 	 ties 	 	are	better	off	when	women	are	 politic 	 ally 	 	and	 economic 	 ally 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	,	that	 value 	 s 	 	are	 pass 	 ed 	 	down	,	the	health	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	better	,	education	is	better	,	there	is	 great 	 er 	 	economic	 prosper 	 ity 	 	.
so	i	think	that	it	 behoove 	 s 	 	us	--	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	that	live	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	where	we	do	have	economic	and	 politic 	 al 	 	voice	--	that	we	need	to	help	other	women	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	that	,	both	at	the	u.n.	and	then	 a 	 s 	 	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	.
pm	:	and	did	you	get	 push 	 back 	 	from	making	that	a	central	 ten 	 ant 	 	of	foreign	policy	?
ma	:	from	some	people	.
i	think	that	they	thought	that	it	was	a	soft	issue	.
the	bottom	line	that	i	 decide 	 d 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	women	's	 issue 	 s 	 	are	the	 hard 	 est 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	have	to	do	with	life	and	death	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	central	to	the	way	that	we	think	about	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	some	of	the	 war 	 s 	 	that	took	place	when	i	was	in	 off 	 ice 	 	,	a	lot	of	them	,	the	women	 we 	 re 	 	the	main	 victim 	 s 	 	of	it	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 war 	 s 	 	in	the	balkans	.
the	women	in	bosnia	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	.
we	then	 manage 	 d 	 	to	set	up	a	war	 crime 	 s 	 	 trib 	 un 	 al 	 	to	deal	 specific 	 ally 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	by	the	way	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	did	at	that	stage	was	,	i	had	just	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	the	u.n.	,	and	when	i	was	there	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	183	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	u.n	.
now	there	are	192	.
but	it	was	one	of	the	first	 time 	 s 	 	that	i	did	n't	have	to	cook	lunch	 my 	 self 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	my	 assist 	 ant 	 	,	``	 invit 	 e 	 	the	other	women	permanent	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	thought	when	i	'd	get	to	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	that	there	'd	be	a	lot	of	women	there	.
i	get	there	,	and	there	are	six	other	women	,	out	of	183	.
so	the	 count 	 ries 	 	that	had	women	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	canada	,	kazakhstan	,	philippines	,	trinidad	tobago	,	jamaica	,	lichtenstein	and	me	.
so	 be 	 ing 	 	an	american	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	set	up	a	 ca 	 u 	 cus 	 	.
and	so	we	set	it	up	,	and	we	 call 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	g	7	.
pm	:	is	that	``	girl	7	?	``	ma	:	girl	7	.
and	we	 lobbi 	 ed 	 	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	women	's	 issue 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	two	women	 judg 	 es 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	war	 crime 	 s 	 	 trib 	 un 	 al 	 	.
and	then	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	declare	that	rape	was	a	weapon	of	war	,	that	it	was	against	 human 	 ity 	 	.
pm	:	so	when	you	look	around	the	world	and	you	see	that	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	--	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	the	western	world	--	women	are	 evolv 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	more	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 position 	 s 	 	,	and	even	other	 place 	 s 	 	some	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	down	,	but	there	's	still	so	much	violence	,	still	so	 man 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	yet	we	hear	there	are	more	women	at	the	 negoti 	 ating 	 	 table 	 s 	 	.
now	you	 we 	 re 	 	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 negoti 	 ating 	 	 table 	 s 	 	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	,	when	there	was	 may 	 be 	 	you	--	one	voice	,	 may 	 be 	 	one	or	two	 other 	 s 	 	.
do	you	 believ 	 e 	 	,	and	can	you	tell	us	why	,	there	is	going	to	be	a	significant	shift	in	 thing 	 s 	 	like	violence	and	peace	and	conflict	and	 re 	 solution 	 	on	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	?
ma	:	well	i	do	think	,	when	there	are	more	women	,	that	the	tone	of	the	conversation	 change 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 goal 	 s 	 	of	the	conversation	change	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	the	whole	world	would	be	a	lot	better	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	run	by	women	.
if	you	think	that	,	you	've	 for 	 gotten 	 	high	school	.
but	the	bottom	line	is	that	there	is	a	way	,	when	there	are	more	women	at	the	table	,	that	there	's	an	attempt	to	develop	some	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	what	i	did	when	i	went	to	burundi	,	we	'd	got	tutsi	and	hutu	women	together	to	talk	about	some	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	had	taken	place	in	rwanda	.
and	so	i	think	the	 cap 	 ability 	 	of	women	to	put	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	i	think	we	're	better	about	 put 	 ting 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	other	guy	's	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	more	 empath 	 y 	 	.
i	think	it	 help 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	support	if	there	are	other	women	in	the	room	.
when	i	was	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	13	other	women	foreign	 mini 	 sters 	 	.
and	so	it	was	nice	when	one	of	them	would	show	up	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	she	is	now	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	finland	,	but	tarja	halonen	was	the	foreign	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	finland	and	,	at	a	certain	stage	,	head	of	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	.
and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 terr 	 ific 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	think	you	'll	understand	.
we	went	to	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	men	in	my	 deleg 	 ation 	 	,	when	i	would	say	,	``	well	i	feel	we	should	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	and	they	'd	say	,	``	what	do	you	mean	,	you	feel	?	``
and	so	then	tarja	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	table	from	me	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 arm 	 s 	 	control	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	i	feel	we	should	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	my	male	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	kind	of	got	it	all	of	a	sudden	.
but	i	think	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	help	to	have	a	critical	mass	of	women	in	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	foreign	policy	 position 	 s 	 	.
the	other	thing	that	i	think	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	:	a	lot	of	national	security	policy	is	n't	just	about	foreign	policy	,	but	it	's	about	 budget 	 s 	 	,	 militar 	 y 	 	 budget 	 s 	 	,	and	how	the	 debt 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	work	out	.
so	if	you	have	women	in	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	foreign	policy	 post 	 s 	 	,	they	can	support	each	other	when	there	are	budget	 decision 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	made	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 count 	 ries 	 	.
pm	:	so	how	do	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	balance	we	're	looking	for	,	then	,	in	the	world	?
more	women	's	 voice 	 s 	 	at	the	table	?
more	men	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	balance	is	best	?
ma	:	well	i	think	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	 chair 	 man 	 	of	the	board	of	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	national	 democrat 	 ic 	 	institute	that	 work 	 s 	 	to	support	women	 candid 	 ates 	 	.
i	think	that	we	need	to	help	in	other	 count 	 ries 	 	to	train	women	to	be	in	 politic 	 al 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	,	to	figure	out	how	they	can	in	fact	develop	 politic 	 al 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	.
i	think	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	be	 support 	 ive 	 	when	 business 	 es 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 create 	 d 	 	and	just	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	women	help	each	other	.
now	i	have	a	 say 	 ing 	 	that	i	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	about	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	of	a	certain	age	where	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	my	 care 	 er 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	other	women	who	 critic 	 ized 	 	me	:	``	why	are	n't	you	in	the	 car 	 pool 	 	line	?	``
or	``	are	n't	your	children	 suffer 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	not	there	all	the	time	?	``
and	i	think	we	have	a	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	make	each	other	feel	 guilt 	 y 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	think	``	guilt	``	is	every	woman	's	middle	name	.
and	so	i	think	what	 need 	 s 	 	to	happen	is	we	need	to	help	each	other	.
and	my	 mot 	 to 	 	is	that	there	's	a	special	place	in	hell	for	women	who	do	n't	help	each	other	.
pm	:	well	 secret 	 ary 	 	albright	,	i	guess	you	'll	be	going	to	heaven	.
thank	you	for	 join 	 ing 	 	us	 to 	 day 	 	.
ma	:	thank	you	all	.	 thank 	 s 	 	pat	.
