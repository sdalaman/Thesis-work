it	's	the	second	world	war	.
a	german	 pri 	 son 	 	camp	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	man	,	archie	cochrane	,	is	a	prisoner	of	war	and	a	doctor	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	problem	.
the	problem	is	that	the	men	under	his	care	are	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	an	 excruciat 	 ing 	 	and	 debilit 	 ating 	 	condition	that	archie	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	.
the	 symptom 	 s 	 	are	 th 	 is 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 s 	 well 	 ing 	 	up	of	 fluid 	 s 	 	under	the	skin	.
but	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	an	 infect 	 ion 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	to	do	with	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	how	to	cure	it	.
and	he	's	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	a	 hostil 	 e 	 	environment	.
and	people	do	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 war 	 s 	 	.
the	german	camp	 guard 	 s 	 	,	they	've	got	 bor 	 ed 	 	.
they	've	taken	to	just	 fir 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pri 	 son 	 	camp	at	random	for	 f 	 un 	 	.
on	one	 part 	 icular 	 	occasion	,	one	of	the	 guard 	 s 	 	threw	a	grenade	 in 	 to 	 	the	 prisoner 	 s 	 	'	 lav 	 atory 	 	while	it	was	full	of	 prisoner 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	heard	suspicious	laughter	.
and	archie	cochrane	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	camp	doctor	,	was	one	of	the	first	men	in	to	clear	up	the	mess	.
and	one	more	thing	:	archie	was	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
so	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	desperate	.
but	archie	cochrane	was	a	 resource 	 ful 	 	person	.
he	'd	 al 	 ready 	 	 smuggle 	 d 	 	 vita 	 min 	 	c	 in 	 to 	 	the	camp	,	and	now	he	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	hold	of	 suppli 	 es 	 	of	 mar 	 mite 	 	on	the	black	market	.
now	some	of	you	will	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	what	 mar 	 mite 	 	is	.
 mar 	 mite 	 	is	a	 break 	 fast 	 	spread	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	of	the	british	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	.
it	 taste 	 s 	 	...
 ze 	 s 	 ty 	 	.
and	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	rich	source	of	 vita 	 min 	 	b	12	.
so	archie	 split 	 s 	 	the	men	under	his	care	 a 	 s 	 	best	he	can	 in 	 to 	 	two	equal	 group 	 s 	 	.
he	 give 	 s 	 	half	of	them	 vita 	 min 	 	c	.
he	 give 	 s 	 	half	of	them	 vita 	 min 	 	b	12	.
he	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	and	 meticulous 	 ly 	 	 note 	 s 	 	his	 result 	 s 	 	in	an	 exercis 	 e 	 	book	.
and	after	just	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	clear	that	 what 	 ever 	 	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 	,	 mar 	 mite 	 	is	the	cure	.
so	cochrane	then	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	germans	who	are	running	the	 pri 	 son 	 	camp	.
now	you	've	got	to	imagine	at	the	moment	--	forget	 th 	 is 	 	photo	,	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	guy	with	 th 	 is 	 	long	 ging 	 er 	 	beard	and	 th 	 is 	 	shock	of	red	hair	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 s 	 have 	 	--	a	sort	of	billy	connolly	figure	.
cochrane	,	he	 start 	 s 	 	 rant 	 ing 	 	at	these	germans	in	 th 	 is 	 	scottish	accent	--	in	fluent	german	,	by	the	way	,	but	in	a	scottish	accent	--	and	 explain 	 s 	 	to	them	how	german	culture	was	the	culture	that	 g 	 ave 	 	schiller	and	goethe	to	the	world	.
and	he	ca	n't	understand	how	 th 	 is 	 	 bar 	 bar 	 ism 	 	can	be	 toler 	 ated 	 	,	and	he	 vent 	 s 	 	his	 frust 	 ration 	 s 	 	.
and	then	he	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	his	 quarter 	 s 	 	,	 break 	 s 	 	down	and	 weep 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	 hope 	 less 	 	.
but	a	young	german	doctor	 pick 	 s 	 	up	archie	cochrane	's	 exercis 	 e 	 	book	and	 say 	 s 	 	to	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	evidence	is	 incontro 	 vert 	 ible 	 	.
if	we	do	n't	supply	 vita 	 min 	 s 	 	to	the	 prisoner 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	war	crime	.	``
and	the	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 suppli 	 es 	 	of	 vita 	 min 	 	b	12	are	 deliver 	 ed 	 	to	the	camp	,	and	the	 prisoner 	 s 	 	begin	to	 re 	 cover 	 	.
now	i	'm	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	archie	cochrane	is	a	 du 	 de 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	archie	cochrane	is	a	 du 	 de 	 	.
i	'm	not	even	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	the	story	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	we	should	be	running	more	 care 	 fully 	 	controlled	 random 	 ized 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	in	all	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	public	policy	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	think	that	would	 al 	 so 	 	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	awesome	.
i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	 be 	 cause 	 	archie	cochrane	,	all	his	life	,	 f 	 ought 	 	against	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	 affli 	 ction 	 	,	and	he	 real 	 ized 	 	it	was	 debilit 	 ating 	 	to	 individual 	 s 	 	and	it	was	 corros 	 ive 	 	to	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
and	he	had	a	name	for	it	.
he	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	god	complex	.
now	i	can	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	the	god	complex	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
so	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	the	complex	are	,	no	matter	how	 complic 	 ated 	 	the	problem	,	you	have	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	belief	that	you	are	 in 	 fall 	 ibly 	 	right	in	your	solution	.
now	archie	was	a	doctor	,	so	he	hung	around	with	 doctor 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
and	 doctor 	 s 	 	suffer	from	the	god	complex	a	lot	.
now	i	'm	an	economist	,	i	'm	not	a	doctor	,	but	i	see	the	god	complex	around	me	all	the	time	in	my	fellow	 economist 	 s 	 	.
i	see	it	in	our	business	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
i	see	it	in	the	 politic 	 ians 	 	we	vote	for	--	people	who	,	in	the	face	of	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	world	,	are	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	they	understand	the	way	that	the	world	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	you	know	,	with	the	future	 billion 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	,	the	world	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	far	too	complex	to	understand	in	that	way	.
well	let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
imagine	for	a	moment	that	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	tim	harford	in	front	of	you	,	there	was	hans	rosling	 present 	 ing 	 	his	 graph 	 s 	 	.
you	know	hans	:	the	mick	jagger	of	ted	.
and	he	'd	be	 show 	 ing 	 	you	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 anim 	 ations 	 	.
and	they	are	 brilli 	 ant 	 	;	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	work	.
but	a	typical	hans	rosling	graph	:	think	for	a	moment	,	not	what	it	 show 	 s 	 	,	but	think	 in 	 stead 	 	about	what	it	 leav 	 es 	 	out	.
so	it	'll	show	you	gdp	per	capita	,	population	,	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	,	that	's	about	it	.
so	three	 piece 	 s 	 	of	data	for	each	country	--	three	 piece 	 s 	 	of	data	.
three	 piece 	 s 	 	of	data	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
i	mean	,	have	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	graph	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 produce 	 d 	 	by	the	physicist	cesar	hidalgo	.
he	's	at	mit	.
now	you	wo	n't	be	able	to	understand	a	word	of	it	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
cesar	 ha 	 s 	 	 troll 	 ed 	 	the	 data 	 base 	 	of	over	5,000	different	 product 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	used	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	of	network	analysis	to	 interrog 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 data 	 base 	 	and	to	graph	 relationship 	 s 	 	between	the	different	 product 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	work	.
you	show	all	these	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	,	all	these	 inter 	 relation 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	it	'll	be	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	it	is	that	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	grow	.
 brilli 	 ant 	 	work	.
cesar	and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	write	a	piece	for	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	magazine	 explain 	 ing 	 	how	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	cesar	's	work	is	far	too	good	to	explain	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	magazine	.
five	thousand	 product 	 s 	 	--	that	's	still	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
five	thousand	 product 	 s 	 	--	imagine	 count 	 ing 	 	every	product	 categor 	 y 	 	in	cesar	hidalgo	's	data	.
imagine	you	had	one	second	per	product	 categor 	 y 	 	.
in	about	the	length	of	 th 	 is 	 	session	,	you	would	have	 count 	 ed 	 	all	5,000	.
now	imagine	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	for	every	different	type	of	product	on	sale	in	walmart	.
there	are	100,000	there	.	it	would	take	you	all	day	.
now	imagine	 try 	 ing 	 	to	count	every	different	specific	product	and	service	on	sale	in	a	major	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	tokyo	,	london	or	new	york	.
it	's	even	more	difficult	in	edinburgh	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	count	all	the	 whisk 	 y 	 	and	the	 tart 	 an 	 	.
if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	count	every	product	and	service	on	 off 	 er 	 	in	new	york	--	there	are	10	billion	of	them	--	it	would	take	you	317	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	complex	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	is	.
and	i	'm	just	 count 	 ing 	 	 toast 	 ers 	 	here	.
i	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	solve	the	middle	east	problem	.
the	 complex 	 ity 	 	here	is	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
and	just	a	piece	of	 con 	 text 	 	--	the	 socie 	 ties 	 	in	which	our	 brain 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	had	about	300	 product 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	.
you	could	count	them	in	five	 minute 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	the	world	that	 surround 	 s 	 	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	is	why	we	find	the	god	complex	so	 tempt 	 ing 	 	.
we	tend	to	 re 	 treat 	 	and	say	,	``	we	can	draw	a	picture	,	we	can	post	some	 graph 	 s 	 	,	we	get	it	,	we	understand	how	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.	``
and	we	do	n't	.
we	never	do	.
now	i	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	deliver	a	 nihil 	 istic 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	here	.
i	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	we	ca	n't	solve	 complic 	 ated 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	in	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	world	.
we	 clear 	 ly 	 	can	.
but	the	way	we	solve	them	is	with	 humil 	 ity 	 	--	to	abandon	the	god	complex	and	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	a	problem	-	solving	 techni 	 que 	 	that	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	we	have	a	problem	-	solving	 techni 	 que 	 	that	 work 	 s 	 	.
now	you	show	me	a	 success 	 ful 	 	complex	system	,	and	i	will	show	you	a	system	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	through	trial	and	error	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	baby	was	 produce 	 d 	 	through	trial	and	error	.
i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	's	an	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	should	 clar 	 ify 	 	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	baby	is	a	human	body	:	it	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
what	is	evolution	?
over	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 vari 	 ation 	 	and	 s 	 election 	 	,	 vari 	 ation 	 	and	 s 	 election 	 	--	trial	and	error	,	trial	and	error	.
and	it	's	not	just	 bio 	 logical 	 	 system 	 s 	 	that	produce	 miracle 	 s 	 	through	trial	and	error	.
you	could	use	it	in	an	industrial	 con 	 text 	 	.
so	let	's	say	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	detergent	.
let	's	say	you	're	unilever	and	you	want	to	make	detergent	in	a	 factor 	 y 	 	near	liverpool	.
how	do	you	do	it	?
well	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	great	big	tank	full	of	liquid	detergent	.
you	pump	it	at	a	high	pressure	through	a	nozzle	.
you	create	a	spray	of	detergent	.
then	the	spray	 d 	 ries 	 	.	it	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	powder	.
it	 fall 	 s 	 	to	the	floor	.
you	scoop	it	up	.	you	put	it	in	 card 	 board 	 	boxes	.
you	sell	it	at	a	 super 	 market 	 	.
you	make	 lot 	 s 	 	of	money	.
how	do	you	design	that	nozzle	?
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
now	if	you	 a 	 scribe 	 	to	the	god	complex	,	what	you	do	is	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	a	little	god	.
you	find	 your 	 self 	 	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	;	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	a	physicist	--	 some 	 body 	 	who	 understand 	 s 	 	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	fluid	.
and	he	will	,	or	she	will	,	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	optimal	design	of	the	nozzle	.
now	unilever	did	 th 	 is 	 	and	it	did	n't	work	--	too	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
even	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	too	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
but	the	 genetic 	 ist 	 	professor	steve	jones	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	how	unilever	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	--	trial	and	error	,	 vari 	 ation 	 	and	 s 	 election 	 	.
you	take	a	nozzle	and	you	create	10	random	 vari 	 ations 	 	on	the	nozzle	.
you	try	out	all	10	;	you	keep	the	one	that	 work 	 s 	 	best	.
you	create	10	 vari 	 ations 	 	on	that	one	.
you	try	out	all	10.	you	keep	the	one	that	 work 	 s 	 	best	.
you	try	out	10	 vari 	 ations 	 	on	that	one	.
you	see	how	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	right	?
and	after	45	 generation 	 s 	 	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	nozzle	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	a	bit	like	a	 ches 	 s 	 	piece	--	 function 	 s 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	.
we	have	no	idea	why	it	 work 	 s 	 	,	no	idea	at	all	.
and	the	moment	you	step	back	from	the	god	complex	--	let	's	just	try	to	have	a	bunch	of	stuff	;	let	's	have	a	 system 	 atic 	 	way	of	 determi 	 ning 	 	what	's	 work 	 ing 	 	and	what	's	not	--	you	can	solve	your	problem	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	process	of	trial	and	error	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	far	more	common	in	 success 	 ful 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	than	we	care	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	.
and	we	've	heard	a	lot	about	how	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	function	.
the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	still	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
how	did	it	 be 	 come 	 	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	?
i	could	give	you	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 fact 	 s 	 	and	 figure 	 s 	 	about	the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	but	i	think	the	most	 s 	 al 	 ient 	 	one	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	ten	percent	of	american	 business 	 es 	 	disappear	every	year	.
that	is	a	huge	failure	rate	.
it	's	far	 high 	 er 	 	than	the	failure	rate	of	,	say	,	americans	.
ten	percent	of	americans	do	n't	disappear	every	year	.
which	 lead 	 s 	 	us	to	conclude	american	 business 	 es 	 	fail	 fast 	 er 	 	than	americans	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	american	 business 	 es 	 	are	 evolv 	 ing 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	americans	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	they	'll	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 uch 	 	a	high	peak	of	 perfect 	 ion 	 	that	they	will	make	us	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 pet 	 s 	 	--	if	,	of	course	,	they	have	n't	 al 	 ready 	 	 d 	 one 	 	so	.
i	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	wonder	.
but	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	process	of	trial	and	error	that	 explain 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	great	 diverge 	 nce 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	performance	of	western	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	.
it	did	n't	come	 be 	 cause 	 	you	put	some	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	smart	person	in	charge	.
it	's	come	through	trial	and	error	.
now	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	sort	of	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	about	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	last	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	people	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	say	to	me	,	``	well	tim	,	it	's	kind	of	obvious	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	trial	and	error	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	 experiment 	 ation 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
now	why	are	you	just	 wander 	 ing 	 	around	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	obvious	thing	?	``
so	i	say	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	fine	.
you	think	it	's	obvious	?
i	will	admit	it	's	obvious	when	 school 	 s 	 	start	 teach 	 ing 	 	children	that	there	are	some	 problem 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	have	a	correct	answer	.
stop	giving	them	 list 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	every	single	one	of	which	 ha 	 s 	 	an	answer	.
and	there	's	an	 author 	 ity 	 	figure	in	the	corner	 be 	 hind 	 	the	teacher	's	desk	who	 know 	 s 	 	all	the	 answer 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	ca	n't	find	the	 answer 	 s 	 	,	you	must	be	 laz 	 y 	 	or	stupid	.
when	 school 	 s 	 	stop	 do 	 ing 	 	that	all	the	time	,	i	will	admit	that	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	obvious	that	trial	and	error	is	a	good	thing	.
when	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	 stand 	 s 	 	up	 campaign 	 ing 	 	for	 elect 	 ed 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	want	to	fix	our	health	system	.
i	want	to	fix	our	education	system	.
i	have	no	idea	how	to	do	it	.
i	have	half	a	dozen	 idea 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	test	them	out	.	they	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	all	fail	.
then	we	'll	test	some	other	 idea 	 s 	 	out	.
we	'll	find	some	that	work	.	we	'll	build	on	 t 	 hose 	 	.
we	'll	get	rid	of	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	.	``	--	when	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	 campaign 	 s 	 	on	that	platform	,	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	when	 vot 	 ers 	 	like	you	and	me	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	vote	for	that	kind	of	 politic 	 ian 	 	,	then	i	will	admit	that	it	is	obvious	that	trial	and	error	 work 	 s 	 	,	and	that	--	thank	you	.
 un 	 til 	 	then	,	 un 	 til 	 	then	i	'm	going	to	keep	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	about	trial	and	error	and	why	we	should	abandon	the	god	complex	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	hard	to	admit	our	own	 fall 	 ibility 	 	.
it	's	so	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
and	archie	cochrane	 under 	 stood 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 body 	 	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	one	trial	he	ran	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	after	world	war	ii	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	test	out	the	question	of	,	where	is	it	that	 patient 	 s 	 	should	 re 	 cover 	 	from	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	?
should	they	 re 	 cover 	 	in	a	 special 	 ized 	 	cardiac	unit	in	hospital	,	or	should	they	 re 	 cover 	 	at	home	?
all	the	cardiac	 doctor 	 s 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	shut	him	down	.
they	had	the	god	complex	in	 s 	 pad 	 es 	 	.
they	 k 	 new 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 hospital 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	right	place	for	 patient 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 ethic 	 al 	 	to	run	any	kind	of	trial	or	experiment	.
 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	archie	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	 per 	 mission 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
he	ran	his	trial	.
and	after	the	trial	had	 be 	 en 	 	running	for	a	little	while	,	he	 gather 	 ed 	 	together	all	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	around	his	table	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	we	have	some	 pre 	 liminary 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	 statistic 	 ally 	 	significant	.
but	we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	you	're	right	and	i	'm	wrong	.
it	is	 danger 	 ous 	 	for	 patient 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 cover 	 	from	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	at	home	.
they	should	be	in	hospital	.	``
and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 up 	 roar 	 	,	and	all	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	start	 pound 	 ing 	 	the	table	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 ethic 	 al 	 	,	archie	.
you	're	 kill 	 ing 	 	people	with	your	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	.	you	need	to	shut	it	down	now	.
shut	it	down	at	once	.	``
and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	huge	 hub 	 bub 	 	.
archie	lets	it	die	down	.
and	then	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	well	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	the	table	of	 result 	 s 	 	,	i	 swap 	 ped 	 	the	two	 column 	 s 	 	around	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	your	 hospital 	 s 	 	are	 kill 	 ing 	 	people	,	and	they	should	be	at	home	.
would	you	like	to	close	down	the	trial	now	,	or	should	we	wait	 un 	 til 	 	we	have	 ro 	 bust 	 	 result 	 s 	 	?	``
 roll 	 s 	 	through	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	room	.
but	cochrane	would	do	that	kind	of	thing	.
and	the	reason	he	would	do	that	kind	of	thing	is	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 under 	 stood 	 	it	 feel 	 s 	 	so	much	better	to	stand	there	and	say	,	``	here	in	my	own	little	world	,	i	am	a	god	,	i	understand	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	do	not	want	to	have	my	 opinion 	 s 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	.
i	do	not	want	to	have	my	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	tested	.	``
it	 feel 	 s 	 	so	much	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	lay	down	the	law	.
cochrane	 under 	 stood 	 	that	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	that	 fall 	 ibility 	 	,	that	 be 	 ing 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	,	they	hurt	.
and	you	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	need	to	be	 shock 	 ed 	 	out	of	that	.
now	i	'm	not	going	to	pretend	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	easy	.
it	is	n't	easy	.
it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
and	since	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	subject	and	 research 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	subject	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 haunt 	 ed 	 	by	 some 	 thing 	 	a	japanese	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	on	the	subject	.
so	 short 	 ly 	 	after	the	war	,	 th 	 is 	 	young	man	,	yutaka	taniyama	,	 develop 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	conjecture	 call 	 ed 	 	the	taniyama	-	shimura	conjecture	.
it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 instrument 	 al 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	 prov 	 ing 	 	fermat	's	last	 theor 	 em 	 	.
in	fact	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	 prov 	 ing 	 	fermat	's	last	 theor 	 em 	 	.
you	prove	one	,	you	prove	the	other	.
but	it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	a	conjecture	.
taniyama	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	he	could	never	prove	that	it	was	true	.
and	 short 	 ly 	 	before	his	30th	 birth 	 day 	 	in	1958	,	yutaka	taniyama	 kill 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
his	friend	,	goro	shimura	--	who	 work 	 ed 	 	on	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	with	him	--	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 reflect 	 ed 	 	on	taniyama	's	life	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	he	was	not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	person	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	.
he	made	a	lot	of	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
but	he	made	 mistak 	 es 	 	in	a	good	direction	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 emul 	 ate 	 	him	,	but	i	 real 	 ized 	 	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	make	good	 mistak 	 es 	 	.	``
thank	you	.
