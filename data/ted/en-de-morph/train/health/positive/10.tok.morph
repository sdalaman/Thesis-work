with	all	the	legitimate	 concern 	 s 	 	about	 aid 	 s 	 	and	 av 	 ian 	 	flu	--	and	we	'll	hear	about	that	from	the	 brilli 	 ant 	 	dr.	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	i	want	to	talk	about	the	other	 pan 	 demic 	 	,	which	is	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	disease	,	diabetes	,	 hyper 	 tension 	 	--	all	of	which	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 prevent 	 able 	 	for	at	 l 	 east 	 	95	percent	of	people	just	by	changing	diet	and	 life 	 style 	 	.
and	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	there	's	a	 global 	 ization 	 	of	 ill 	 ness 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	,	that	people	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	eat	like	us	,	and	live	like	us	,	and	die	like	us	.	and	in	one	generation	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	's	gone	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	one	of	the	 low 	 est 	 	rates	of	heart	disease	and	 obes 	 ity 	 	and	diabetes	to	one	of	the	highest	.	and	in	africa	,	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	disease	 equal 	 s 	 	the	hiv	and	 aid 	 s 	 	 death 	 s 	 	in	most	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	there	's	a	critical	window	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	we	have	to	make	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	that	can	affect	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 liter 	 ally 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	,	and	practice	 prevent 	 ive 	 	medicine	on	a	global	scale	.
heart	and	blood	vessel	 disease 	 s 	 	still	kill	more	people	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	--	than	 every 	 thing 	 	else	 combine 	 d 	 	,	and	yet	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	 prevent 	 able 	 	for	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 body 	 	.
it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 prevent 	 able 	 	;	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 revers 	 ible 	 	.	and	for	the	last	 al 	 most 	 	29	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	show	that	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	changing	diet	and	 life 	 style 	 	,	using	these	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	tech	,	expensive	,	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 measure 	 s 	 	to	prove	how	 power 	 ful 	 	these	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	and	low	-	tech	and	low	-	cost	 intervention 	 s 	 	can	be	like	--	 quant 	 itative 	 	 arteri 	 ography 	 	,	before	and	after	a	year	,	and	cardiac	pet	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	.
we	 show 	 ed 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	--	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	the	first	 stud 	 y 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	stop	or	reverse	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	by	making	 change 	 s 	 	in	diet	and	 life 	 style 	 	,	and	70	percent	 regress 	 ion 	 	in	the	tumor	growth	,	or	 inhibit 	 ion 	 	of	the	tumor	growth	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 on 	 ly 	 	nine	percent	in	the	control	group	.
and	in	the	mri	and	mr	 spect 	 roscopy 	 	here	,	the	 pro 	 state 	 	tumor	activity	is	 show 	 n 	 	in	red	--	you	can	see	it	 diminish 	 ing 	 	after	a	year	.
now	there	is	an	 epi 	 demic 	 	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	:	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	 adult 	 s 	 	and	15	percent	of	 kid 	 s 	 	.	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 concern 	 ing 	 	to	me	is	that	diabetes	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	70	percent	in	the	past	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	the	first	generation	in	which	our	 kid 	 s 	 	live	a	 short 	 er 	 	life	span	than	we	do	.	that	's	 pit 	 iful 	 	,	and	it	's	 prevent 	 able 	 	.
now	these	are	not	election	 return 	 s 	 	,	these	are	the	people	--	the	number	of	the	people	who	are	 obes 	 e 	 	by	state	,	 begin 	 ning 	 	in	'85	,	'86	,	'87	--	these	are	from	the	cdc	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	--	'88	,	'89	,	'90	,	'91	--	you	get	a	new	 categor 	 y 	 	--	'92	,	'93	,	'94	,	'95	,	'96	,	'97	,	'98	,	'99	,	2000	,	2001	--	it	 get 	 s 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.	we	're	kind	of	devolving	.
now	what	can	we	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	?	well	,	you	know	,	the	diet	that	we	've	found	that	can	reverse	heart	disease	and	cancer	is	an	asian	diet	.
but	the	people	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	eat	like	we	are	,	which	is	why	they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	sick	like	we	are	.
so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	a	lot	of	the	big	food	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.	they	can	make	it	 f 	 un 	 	and	sexy	and	hip	and	 crunch 	 y 	 	and	convenient	to	eat	 health 	 ier 	 	 food 	 s 	 	,	like	--	i	chair	the	 advisor 	 y 	 	 board 	 s 	 	to	mcdonald	's	,	and	pepsico	,	and	conagra	,	and	safeway	,	and	soon	del	monte	,	and	they	're	 find 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	good	business	.
the	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 s 	 	that	you	see	at	mcdonald	's	came	from	the	work	--	they	're	going	to	have	an	asian	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	.	at	pepsi	,	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	revenue	growth	came	from	 the 	 ir 	 	better	 food 	 s 	 	.
and	so	if	we	can	do	that	,	then	we	can	free	up	 resource 	 s 	 	for	 buy 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	that	you	 re 	 ally 	 	do	need	for	 treat 	 ing 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	and	hiv	and	malaria	and	for	 prevent 	 ing 	 	 av 	 ian 	 	flu	.	thank	you	.
