last	year	when	i	was	here	,	i	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	you	about	a	swim	which	i	did	 a 	 cross 	 	the	north	pole	.
and	while	that	swim	took	place	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	can	remember	it	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	was	 yester 	 day 	 	.
i	remember	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	edge	of	the	ice	,	about	to	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	,	and	 think 	 ing 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	have	never	ever	 s 	 een 	 	any	place	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	which	is	just	so	 frighten 	 ing 	 	.
the	water	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	black	.
the	water	is	minus	1.7	 degree 	 s 	 	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	,	or	29	 degree 	 s 	 	fahrenheit	.
it	's	 flip 	 ping 	 	freezing	in	that	water	.
and	then	a	thought	came	 a 	 cross 	 	my	mind	:	if	 thing 	 s 	 	go	pear	-	shaped	on	 th 	 is 	 	swim	,	how	long	will	it	take	for	my	 froze 	 n 	 	body	to	sink	the	four	and	a	half	 kilometer 	 s 	 	to	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	?
and	then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	've	just	got	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	thought	out	of	my	mind	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	i	can	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	freezing	cold	water	and	swim	a	kilometer	is	by	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	my	ipod	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 revv 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	up	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	from	 beaut 	 iful 	 	opera	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	to	puff	 d 	 addy 	 	,	and	then	 commit 	 ting 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	hundred	percent	--	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	the	made	-	up	mind	--	and	then	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	to	the	edge	of	the	ice	and	just	 div 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
and	that	swim	took	me	18	 minute 	 s 	 	and	50	 second 	 s 	 	,	and	it	felt	like	18	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	i	remember	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	the	water	and	my	 hand 	 s 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	so	 pain 	 ful 	 	and	looking	down	at	my	 finger 	 s 	 	,	and	my	 finger 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 sausage 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	--	you	know	,	we	're	made	 partial 	 ly 	 	of	water	--	when	water	 freeze 	 s 	 	it	 expand 	 s 	 	,	and	so	the	 cell 	 s 	 	in	my	 finger 	 s 	 	had	 froze 	 n 	 	and	 expand 	 ed 	 	and	burst	.
and	the	most	 im 	 mediate 	 	thought	when	i	came	out	of	that	water	was	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	:	i	'm	never	,	ever	going	to	do	 an 	 other 	 	cold	water	swim	in	my	life	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	last	year	,	i	heard	about	the	himalayas	and	the	 melt 	 ing 	 	of	the	--	and	the	 melt 	 ing 	 	of	the	 glaci 	 ers 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	climate	change	.
i	heard	about	 th 	 is 	 	lake	,	lake	imja	.
 th 	 is 	 	lake	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 melt 	 ing 	 	of	the	 glaci 	 er 	 	.
the	 glaci 	 er 	 	's	gone	all	the	way	up	the	mountain	and	left	in	 it 	 s 	 	place	 th 	 is 	 	big	lake	.
and	i	 firm 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	in	the	himalayas	is	the	next	great	,	big	 battle 	 ground 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	.
 near 	 ly 	 	two	billion	people	--	so	one	in	three	people	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	--	 re 	 ly 	 	on	the	water	from	the	himalayas	.
and	with	a	population	increasing	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	and	with	the	water	supply	from	these	 glaci 	 ers 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	of	climate	change	--	 decr 	 eas 	 ing 	 	so	much	,	i	think	we	have	a	real	risk	of	 in 	 st 	 ability 	 	.
north	,	you	've	got	 chin 	 a 	 	;	south	,	you	've	india	,	pakistan	,	bangladesh	,	all	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	walk	up	to	mt	.	everest	,	the	highest	mountain	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	,	and	go	and	do	a	 symbol 	 ic 	 	swim	 under 	 neath 	 	the	 summ 	 it 	 	of	mt	.	everest	.
now	,	i	do	n't	know	if	any	of	you	have	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	go	to	mt	.	everest	,	but	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 or 	 deal 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	up	there	.
28	great	,	big	,	 power 	 ful 	 	 yak 	 s 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	all	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	up	onto	 th 	 is 	 	mountain	--	i	do	n't	just	have	my	speedo	,	but	there	's	a	big	film	crew	who	then	 s 	 end 	 	all	the	 image 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
the	other	thing	which	was	so	 challeng 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	swim	is	not	just	the	altitude	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	the	swim	at	5,300	 meter 	 s 	 	above	sea	level	.
so	it	's	right	up	in	the	 heaven 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	breath	.	you	get	altitude	 sick 	 ness 	 	.
i	 feel 	 s 	 	like	you	've	got	a	man	 stand 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	you	with	a	hammer	just	hitting	your	head	all	the	time	.
that	's	not	the	worst	part	of	it	.
the	worst	part	was	 th 	 is 	 	year	was	the	year	where	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	a	big	 clean 	 up 	 	operation	on	mt	.	everest	.
 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 di 	 ed 	 	on	mt	.	everest	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	year	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	and	 re 	 cover 	 	all	the	bodies	of	the	 mountain 	 e 	 ers 	 	and	then	 br 	 ing 	 	them	down	the	mountain	.
and	when	you	're	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	the	mountain	to	attempt	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	which	no	human	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 d 	 one 	 	before	,	and	,	in	fact	,	no	fish	--	there	are	no	fish	up	there	 swimm 	 ing 	 	at	5,300	 meter 	 s 	 	--	when	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	that	,	and	then	the	bodies	are	coming	past	you	,	it	 humble 	 s 	 	you	,	and	you	 al 	 so 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	that	nature	is	so	much	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	we	are	.
and	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	 path 	 way 	 	,	all	the	way	up	.
and	to	the	right	hand	side	of	us	was	 th 	 is 	 	great	khumbu	 glaci 	 er 	 	.
and	all	the	way	 a 	 long 	 	the	 glaci 	 er 	 	we	saw	these	big	 pool 	 s 	 	of	 melt 	 ing 	 	ice	.
and	then	we	got	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	small	lake	 under 	 neath 	 	the	 summ 	 it 	 	of	mt	.	everest	,	and	i	prepared	 my 	 self 	 	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	prepared	 my 	 self 	 	,	for	 th 	 is 	 	swim	which	was	going	to	be	so	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	.
i	put	on	my	ipod	,	i	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	some	music	,	i	got	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	--	but	controlled	 aggress 	 ion 	 	--	and	then	i	 hur 	 led 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	water	.
i	swam	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	for	the	first	hundred	 meter 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	i	had	a	huge	problem	on	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
i	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	breathe	.
i	was	 gasp 	 ing 	 	for	air	.
i	then	 beg 	 an 	 	to	choke	,	and	then	it	 quick 	 ly 	 	led	to	me	 vomit 	 ing 	 	in	the	water	.
and	it	all	 happen 	 ed 	 	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	:	i	then	--	i	do	n't	know	how	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	but	i	went	 under 	 water 	 	.
and	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	the	water	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 sh 	 allow 	 	,	and	i	was	able	to	push	 my 	 self 	 	off	the	bottom	of	the	lake	and	get	up	and	then	take	 an 	 other 	 	gasp	of	air	.
and	then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	carry	on	.	carry	on	.	carry	on	.
i	carried	on	for	 an 	 other 	 	five	or	six	 stroke 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	my	body	,	and	i	went	down	to	the	bottom	of	the	lake	.
and	i	do	n't	where	i	got	it	from	,	but	i	was	able	to	 some 	 how 	 	pull	 my 	 self 	 	up	and	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	get	to	the	side	of	the	lake	.
i	've	heard	it	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 drown 	 ing 	 	is	the	most	 peace 	 ful 	 	death	that	you	can	have	.
i	have	never	,	ever	heard	 s 	 uch 	 	utter	 bol 	 lock 	 s 	 	.
it	is	the	most	 frighten 	 ing 	 	and	 panic 	 ky 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	you	can	have	.
i	got	 my 	 self 	 	to	the	side	of	the	lake	.
my	crew	 grab 	 bed 	 	me	,	and	then	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	down	--	over	the	 rub 	 ble 	 	--	down	to	our	camp	.
and	there	,	we	 s 	 at 	 	down	,	and	we	did	a	 de 	 brief 	 	about	what	had	gone	wrong	there	on	mt	.	everest	.
and	my	team	just	 g 	 ave 	 	it	to	me	straight	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	lewis	,	you	need	to	have	a	radical	 tactic 	 al 	 	shift	if	you	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	swim	.
every	single	thing	which	you	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	23	 year 	 s 	 	of	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	you	must	forget	.
every	single	thing	which	you	 learn 	 ed 	 	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	 serv 	 ing 	 	in	the	british	 arm 	 y 	 	,	about	speed	and	 aggress 	 ion 	 	,	you	put	that	to	one	side	.
we	want	you	to	walk	up	the	hill	in	 an 	 other 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	'	time	.
take	some	time	to	rest	and	think	about	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	want	you	to	walk	up	the	mountain	in	two	 day 	 s 	 	'	time	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 swimm 	 ing 	 	fast	,	swim	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 swimm 	 ing 	 	crawl	,	swim	 breast 	 stroke 	 	.
and	remember	,	never	ever	swim	with	 aggress 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	time	to	swim	with	real	 humil 	 ity 	 	.
and	so	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	back	up	to	the	mountain	two	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	i	stood	there	on	the	edge	of	the	lake	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	at	mt	.	everest	--	and	she	is	one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 mountain 	 s 	 	on	the	earth	--	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	just	do	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	swam	 a 	 cross 	 	the	lake	.
and	i	ca	n't	begin	to	tell	you	how	good	i	felt	when	i	came	to	the	other	side	.
but	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	two	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	there	on	mt	.	everest	,	and	i	thank	my	team	of	sherpas	who	taught	me	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	first	one	is	that	just	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	so	well	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	it	's	going	to	work	in	the	future	.
and	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	now	,	before	i	do	 any 	 thing 	 	,	i	ask	 my 	 self 	 	what	type	of	 mind 	 set 	 	do	i	 requir 	 e 	 	to	 success 	 fully 	 	complete	a	task	.
and	taking	that	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	of	climate	change	--	which	is	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	the	mt	.	everest	of	all	 problem 	 s 	 	--	just	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	lived	the	way	we	have	lived	for	so	long	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 consum 	 ed 	 	the	way	we	have	for	so	long	and	 populate 	 d 	 	the	earth	the	way	we	have	for	so	long	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	we	can	carry	on	the	way	we	are	 carry 	 ing 	 	on	.
the	 war 	 ning 	 	 sign 	 s 	 	are	all	there	.
when	i	was	born	,	the	world	's	population	was	3.5	billion	people	.
we	're	now	6.8	billion	people	,	and	we	're	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	be	9	billion	people	by	2050	.
and	then	the	second	 less 	 on 	 	,	the	radical	,	 tactic 	 al 	 	shift	.
and	i	've	come	here	to	ask	you	 to 	 day 	 	:	what	radical	 tactic 	 al 	 	shift	can	you	take	in	your	relationship	to	the	environment	,	which	will	ensure	that	our	children	and	our	 grand 	 children 	 	live	in	a	safe	world	and	a	secure	world	,	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	in	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	world	?
and	i	ask	you	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	to	go	away	from	here	and	think	about	that	one	radical	 tactic 	 al 	 	shift	which	you	could	make	,	which	will	make	that	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	then	commit	a	hundred	percent	to	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
blog	about	it	,	tweet	about	it	,	talk	about	it	,	and	commit	a	hundred	percent	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 im 	 possible 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	if	we	 re 	 ally 	 	put	our	whole	 mind 	 s 	 	to	it	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
