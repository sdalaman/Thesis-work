first	,	a	video	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	is	a	 scramble 	 d 	 	egg	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	look	at	it	,	i	hope	you	'll	begin	to	feel	just	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 un 	 easy 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	may	notice	that	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	egg	is	 un 	 s 	 cram 	 bling 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	you	'll	now	see	the	 yo 	 lk 	 	and	the	white	have	 separat 	 ed 	 	.
and	now	they	're	going	to	be	 pour 	 ed 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	egg	.
and	we	all	know	in	our	heart	of	 heart 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	way	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
a	 scramble 	 d 	 	egg	is	mush	--	tasty	mush	--	but	it	's	mush	.
an	egg	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	thing	that	can	create	even	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 chicken 	 s 	 	.
and	we	know	in	our	heart	of	 heart 	 s 	 	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	travel	from	mush	to	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	gut	instinct	is	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	one	of	the	most	fundamental	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	,	the	second	law	of	 thermo 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	or	the	law	of	 ent 	 ropy 	 	.
what	that	 say 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	is	that	the	general	 tend 	 ency 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	to	move	from	order	and	structure	to	lack	of	order	,	lack	of	structure	--	in	fact	,	to	mush	.
and	that	's	why	that	video	 feel 	 s 	 	a	bit	strange	.
and	yet	,	look	around	us	.
what	we	see	around	us	is	 stagger 	 ing 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
eric	beinhocker	 estimate 	 s 	 	that	in	new	york	city	 al 	 one 	 	,	there	are	some	10	billion	skus	,	or	distinct	 commodit 	 ies 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 trade 	 d 	 	.
that	's	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	species	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	on	earth	.
and	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 trade 	 d 	 	by	a	species	of	 al 	 most 	 	seven	billion	 individual 	 s 	 	,	who	are	linked	by	trade	,	travel	,	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	global	system	of	stupendous	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
so	here	's	a	great	 puzzl 	 e 	 	:	in	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	 rul 	 ed 	 	by	the	second	law	of	 thermo 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	how	is	it	possible	to	generate	the	sort	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	i	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	the	sort	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	you	and	me	and	the	convention	center	?
well	,	the	answer	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	can	create	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	but	with	great	 difficult 	 y 	 	.
in	 pocket 	 s 	 	,	there	appear	what	my	 col 	 league 	 	,	fred	spier	,	 call 	 s 	 	``	goldilocks	 condition 	 s 	 	``	--	not	too	hot	,	not	too	cold	,	just	right	for	the	creation	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
and	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	appear	.
and	where	you	have	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	can	get	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	 complex 	 ity 	 	 build 	 s 	 	stage	by	stage	.
each	stage	is	 magic 	 al 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 create 	 s 	 	the	impression	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 utter 	 ly 	 	new	 appear 	 ing 	 	 al 	 most 	 	out	of	 no 	 where 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
we	refer	in	big	 histo 	 ry 	 	to	these	 moment 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	threshold	 moment 	 s 	 	.
and	at	each	threshold	,	the	going	 get 	 s 	 	 tough 	 er 	 	.
the	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	get	more	fragile	,	more	 vulner 	 able 	 	;	the	goldilocks	 condition 	 s 	 	get	more	 string 	 ent 	 	,	and	it	's	more	difficult	to	create	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
now	,	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	complex	 creature 	 s 	 	,	 desperate 	 ly 	 	need	to	know	 th 	 is 	 	story	of	how	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 create 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	the	second	law	,	and	why	 complex 	 ity 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 vulner 	 ability 	 	and	 f 	 rag 	 ility 	 	.
and	that	's	the	story	that	we	tell	in	big	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
but	to	do	it	,	you	have	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	may	,	at	first	sight	,	seem	 complete 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
you	have	to	survey	the	whole	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	let	's	do	it	.
let	's	begin	by	 wind 	 ing 	 	the	 time 	 line 	 	back	13.7	billion	 year 	 s 	 	,	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	time	.
around	us	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	not	even	time	or	space	.
imagine	the	 dark 	 est 	 	,	 empti 	 est 	 	thing	you	can	and	cube	it	a	 ga 	 zillion 	 	 time 	 s 	 	and	that	's	where	we	are	.
and	then	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	bang	!	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	,	an	entire	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	we	've	 cross 	 ed 	 	our	first	threshold	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 tin 	 y 	 	;	it	's	 small 	 er 	 	than	an	atom	.
it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	hot	.
it	 contain 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	so	you	can	imagine	,	it	's	 bust 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	 expand 	 ing 	 	at	 in 	 credible 	 	speed	.
and	at	first	,	it	's	just	a	blur	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	distinct	 thing 	 s 	 	begin	to	appear	in	that	blur	.
 with 	 in 	 	the	first	second	,	energy	 it 	 self 	 	 shatter 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	distinct	 force 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 electro 	 magnet 	 ism 	 	and	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
and	energy	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 quit 	 e 	 	 magic 	 al 	 	:	it	 con 	 ge 	 al 	 s 	 	to	form	matter	--	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	that	will	create	 proton 	 s 	 	and	 lep 	 ton 	 s 	 	that	include	 electron 	 s 	 	.
and	all	of	that	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	first	second	.
now	we	move	forward	380,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	's	twice	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
and	now	simple	 atom 	 s 	 	appear	of	hydrogen	and	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
now	i	want	to	pause	for	a	moment	,	380,000	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	about	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	stage	.
we	know	above	all	that	it	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	simple	.
it	 consist 	 ed 	 	of	huge	 cloud 	 s 	 	of	hydrogen	and	 hel 	 ium 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	,	and	they	have	no	structure	.
they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	a	sort	of	 cosm 	 ic 	 	mush	.
but	that	's	not	 complete 	 ly 	 	true	.
 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	by	 satellite 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	wmap	satellite	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	,	in	fact	,	there	are	just	 tin 	 y 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	that	 back 	 ground 	 	.
what	you	see	here	,	the	blue	 area 	 s 	 	are	about	a	 thousand 	 th 	 	of	a	degree	 cool 	 er 	 	than	the	red	 area 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 tin 	 y 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	but	it	was	 en 	 ough 	 	for	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	to	move	on	to	the	next	stage	of	building	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
 gravit 	 y 	 	is	more	 power 	 ful 	 	where	there	's	more	stuff	.
so	where	you	get	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	 gravit 	 y 	 	 start 	 s 	 	 compact 	 ing 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	of	hydrogen	and	 hel 	 ium 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	.
so	we	can	imagine	the	early	 uni 	 verse 	 	 break 	 ing 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	a	billion	 cloud 	 s 	 	.
and	each	cloud	is	 compact 	 ed 	 	,	 gravit 	 y 	 	 get 	 s 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	density	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	,	the	temperature	 begin 	 s 	 	to	rise	at	the	center	of	each	cloud	,	and	then	,	at	the	center	of	each	cloud	,	the	temperature	 cross 	 es 	 	the	threshold	temperature	of	10	million	 degree 	 s 	 	,	 proton 	 s 	 	start	to	fuse	,	there	's	a	huge	 re 	 lease 	 	of	energy	,	and	,	 b 	 am 	 	!
we	have	our	first	 star 	 s 	 	.
from	about	200	million	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	big	bang	,	 star 	 s 	 	begin	to	appear	all	through	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 billion 	 s 	 	of	them	.
and	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	now	 significant 	 ly 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	more	complex	.
 star 	 s 	 	will	create	the	goldilocks	 condition 	 s 	 	for	 cross 	 ing 	 	two	new	 threshold 	 s 	 	.
when	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 star 	 s 	 	die	,	they	create	 temperature 	 s 	 	so	high	that	 proton 	 s 	 	begin	to	fuse	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 ex 	 otic 	 	 combination 	 s 	 	,	to	form	all	the	 element 	 s 	 	of	the	 period 	 ic 	 	table	.
if	,	like	me	,	you	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	gold	ring	,	it	was	 for 	 ged 	 	in	a	supernova	explosion	.
so	now	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 chemical 	 ly 	 	more	complex	.
and	in	a	 chemical 	 ly 	 	more	complex	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	it	's	possible	to	make	more	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 start 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	,	around	young	 s 	 un 	 s 	 	,	young	 star 	 s 	 	,	all	these	 element 	 s 	 	combine	,	they	swirl	around	,	the	energy	of	the	star	 stir 	 s 	 	them	around	,	they	form	 particle 	 s 	 	,	they	form	 snow 	 flake 	 s 	 	,	they	form	little	dust	 mote 	 s 	 	,	they	form	 rock 	 s 	 	,	they	form	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	they	form	 planet 	 s 	 	and	 moon 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	how	our	solar	system	was	 form 	 ed 	 	,	four	and	a	half	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 rock 	 y 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	like	our	earth	are	 significant 	 ly 	 	more	complex	than	 star 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	contain	a	much	 great 	 er 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 material 	 s 	 	.
so	we	've	 cross 	 ed 	 	a	fourth	threshold	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
now	,	the	going	 get 	 s 	 	 tough 	 er 	 	.
the	next	stage	 introduc 	 es 	 	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	are	 significant 	 ly 	 	more	fragile	,	 significant 	 ly 	 	more	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	but	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	much	more	creative	and	much	more	 cap 	 able 	 	of	generating	further	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	of	course	,	about	living	 organism 	 s 	 	.
living	 organism 	 s 	 	are	 create 	 d 	 	by	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
we	are	huge	 package 	 s 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 chemist 	 ry 	 	is	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	force	.
that	 oper 	 ates 	 	over	 small 	 er 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	than	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	which	 explain 	 s 	 	why	you	and	i	are	 small 	 er 	 	than	 star 	 s 	 	or	 planet 	 s 	 	.
now	,	what	are	the	ideal	 condition 	 s 	 	for	 chemist 	 ry 	 	?
what	are	the	goldilocks	 condition 	 s 	 	?
well	,	first	,	you	need	energy	,	but	not	too	much	.
in	the	center	of	a	star	,	there	's	so	much	energy	that	any	 atom 	 s 	 	that	combine	will	just	get	 bust 	 ed 	 	 a 	 part 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	not	too	little	.
in	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	,	there	's	so	little	energy	that	 atom 	 s 	 	ca	n't	combine	.
what	you	want	is	just	the	right	amount	,	and	 planet 	 s 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	are	just	right	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	close	to	 star 	 s 	 	,	but	not	too	close	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	need	a	great	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	chemical	 element 	 s 	 	,	and	you	need	liquid	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	water	.
why	?
well	,	in	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	,	 atom 	 s 	 	move	past	each	other	so	fast	that	they	ca	n't	hitch	up	.
in	 solid 	 s 	 	,	 atom 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 tuck 	 	together	,	they	ca	n't	move	.
in	 liquid 	 s 	 	,	they	can	 cruis 	 e 	 	and	 cuddl 	 e 	 	and	link	up	to	form	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
now	,	where	do	you	find	 s 	 uch 	 	goldilocks	 condition 	 s 	 	?
well	,	 planet 	 s 	 	are	great	,	and	our	early	earth	was	 al 	 most 	 	perfect	.
it	was	just	the	right	distance	from	 it 	 s 	 	star	to	contain	huge	 ocean 	 s 	 	of	open	water	.
and	deep	 be 	 neath 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	at	 crack 	 s 	 	in	the	earth	's	crust	,	you	've	got	heat	 seep 	 ing 	 	up	from	 in 	 side 	 	the	earth	,	and	you	've	got	a	great	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 element 	 s 	 	.
so	at	 t 	 hose 	 	deep	 ocean 	 ic 	 	 vent 	 s 	 	,	fantastic	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	happen	,	and	 atom 	 s 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 ex 	 otic 	 	 combination 	 s 	 	.
but	of	course	,	life	is	more	than	just	 ex 	 otic 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
how	do	you	 stabil 	 ize 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	huge	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	seem	to	be	 vi 	 able 	 	?
well	,	it	's	here	that	life	 introduc 	 es 	 	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	trick	.
you	do	n't	 stabil 	 ize 	 	the	individual	;	you	 stabil 	 ize 	 	the	template	,	the	thing	that	 car 	 ries 	 	information	,	and	you	allow	the	template	to	copy	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	dna	,	of	course	,	is	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	molecule	that	 contain 	 s 	 	that	information	.
you	'll	be	familiar	with	the	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	of	dna	.
each	rung	 contain 	 s 	 	information	.
so	,	dna	 contain 	 s 	 	information	about	how	to	make	living	 organism 	 s 	 	.
and	dna	 al 	 so 	 	copies	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	,	it	copies	 it 	 self 	 	and	 scatter 	 s 	 	the	 template 	 s 	 	through	the	ocean	.
so	the	information	 spread 	 s 	 	.
notice	that	information	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	our	story	.
the	real	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	dna	 th 	 ough 	 	is	in	 it 	 s 	 	 im 	 perfect 	 ions 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	copies	 it 	 self 	 	,	once	in	every	billion	 rung 	 s 	 	,	there	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	an	error	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	dna	is	,	in	effect	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 accumul 	 ating 	 	new	ways	of	making	living	 organism 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 error 	 s 	 	work	.
so	dna	's	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	it	's	building	 great 	 er 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	 great 	 er 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
and	we	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	over	the	last	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
for	most	of	that	time	of	life	on	earth	,	living	 organism 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	simple	--	single	 cell 	 s 	 	.
but	they	had	great	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	and	,	 in 	 side 	 	,	great	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
then	from	about	600	to	800	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	multi	-	celled	 organism 	 s 	 	appear	.
you	get	fungi	,	you	get	fish	,	you	get	 plant 	 s 	 	,	you	get	 amphi 	 bia 	 	,	you	get	 reptil 	 es 	 	,	and	then	,	of	course	,	you	get	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
and	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	there	are	 disaster 	 s 	 	.
sixty	-	five	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	on	earth	near	the	yucatan	 pen 	 insula 	 	,	creating	 condition 	 s 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	of	a	nuclear	war	,	and	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	.
 terr 	 ible 	 	news	for	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	but	great	news	for	our	 mammal 	 ian 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	who	 flourish 	 ed 	 	in	the	 niche 	 s 	 	left	empty	by	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
and	we	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	part	of	that	creative	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	that	 beg 	 an 	 	65	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	with	the	 land 	 ing 	 	of	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	.
 human 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	about	200,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	count	 a 	 s 	 	a	threshold	in	 th 	 is 	 	great	story	.
let	me	explain	why	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	dna	 learn 	 s 	 	in	a	sense	,	it	 accumul 	 ates 	 	information	.
but	it	is	so	 s 	 low 	 	.
dna	 accumul 	 ates 	 	information	through	random	 error 	 s 	 	,	some	of	which	just	happen	to	work	.
but	dna	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	generated	a	 fast 	 er 	 	way	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	:	it	had	 produce 	 d 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	with	 brain 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	can	learn	in	real	time	.
they	 accumul 	 ate 	 	information	,	they	learn	.
the	 s 	 ad 	 	thing	is	,	when	they	die	,	the	information	dies	with	them	.
now	what	 make 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	different	is	human	language	.
we	are	 bless 	 ed 	 	with	a	language	,	a	system	of	communication	,	so	 power 	 ful 	 	and	so	precise	that	we	can	share	what	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	with	 s 	 uch 	 	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	that	it	can	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	it	can	 out 	 last 	 	the	 individual 	 s 	 	who	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	information	,	and	it	can	 accumul 	 ate 	 	from	generation	to	generation	.
and	that	's	why	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	,	we	're	so	creative	and	so	 power 	 ful 	 	,	and	that	's	why	we	have	a	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	seem	to	be	the	 on 	 ly 	 	species	in	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	gift	.
i	call	 th 	 is 	 	ability	 collect 	 ive 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	different	.
we	can	see	it	at	work	in	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	 stage 	 s 	 	of	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	in	the	savanna	 land 	 s 	 	of	africa	,	but	then	you	see	 human 	 s 	 	 migr 	 ating 	 	 in 	 to 	 	new	 environment 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	desert	 land 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 jungle 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	ice	age	 t 	 un 	 dra 	 	of	siberia	--	tough	,	tough	environment	--	 in 	 to 	 	the	americas	,	 in 	 to 	 	australasia	.
each	 migr 	 ation 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	--	 learn 	 ing 	 	new	ways	of	 exploit 	 ing 	 	the	environment	,	new	ways	of	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
then	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 exploit 	 ing 	 	a	sudden	change	in	global	climate	with	the	end	of	the	last	ice	age	,	 human 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	farm	.
 farm 	 ing 	 	was	an	energy	 bon 	 a 	 nza 	 	.
and	 exploit 	 ing 	 	that	energy	,	human	 population 	 s 	 	 multi 	 plied 	 	.
human	 socie 	 ties 	 	got	 large 	 r 	 	,	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	,	more	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	from	about	500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 human 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	link	up	 global 	 ly 	 	through	 ship 	 ping 	 	,	through	 train 	 s 	 	,	through	 tele 	 graph 	 	,	through	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	now	we	seem	to	form	a	single	global	brain	of	 al 	 most 	 	seven	billion	 individual 	 s 	 	.
and	that	brain	is	 learn 	 ing 	 	at	warp	speed	.
and	in	the	last	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
we	've	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	on	 an 	 other 	 	energy	 bon 	 a 	 nza 	 	in	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
so	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	and	 collect 	 ive 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	together	explain	the	 stagger 	 ing 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	we	see	around	us	.
so	,	here	we	are	,	back	at	the	convention	center	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	on	a	journey	,	a	return	journey	,	of	13.7	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	hope	you	agree	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 power 	 ful 	 	story	.
and	it	's	a	story	in	which	 human 	 s 	 	play	an	 astonish 	 ing 	 	and	creative	role	.
but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 contain 	 s 	 	 war 	 ning 	 s 	 	.
 collect 	 ive 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	force	,	and	it	's	not	clear	that	we	 human 	 s 	 	are	in	charge	of	it	.
i	remember	 ver 	 y 	 	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	growing	up	in	england	,	living	through	the	cuban	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	crisis	.
for	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	the	entire	 bio 	 sphere 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.
and	the	same	 weapon 	 s 	 	are	still	here	,	and	they	are	still	 arm 	 ed 	 	.
if	we	avoid	that	trap	,	 other 	 s 	 	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	us	.
we	're	 burn 	 ing 	 	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	at	 s 	 uch 	 	a	rate	that	we	seem	to	be	 under 	 min 	 ing 	 	the	goldilocks	 condition 	 s 	 	that	made	it	possible	for	human	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	to	flourish	over	the	last	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	what	big	 histo 	 ry 	 	can	do	is	show	us	the	nature	of	our	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	 f 	 rag 	 ility 	 	and	the	 danger 	 s 	 	that	face	us	,	but	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	show	us	our	power	with	 collect 	 ive 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
and	now	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	want	.
i	want	my	 grand 	 son 	 	,	daniel	,	and	his	 friend 	 s 	 	and	his	generation	,	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	,	to	know	the	story	of	big	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	to	know	it	so	well	that	they	understand	both	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	face	us	and	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	face	us	.
and	that	's	why	a	group	of	us	are	building	a	free	,	 on 	 line 	 	syllabus	in	big	 histo 	 ry 	 	for	high	school	 student 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	big	 histo 	 ry 	 	will	be	a	vital	intellectual	tool	for	them	,	 a 	 s 	 	daniel	and	his	generation	face	the	huge	 challeng 	 es 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	them	at	 th 	 is 	 	threshold	moment	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	our	 beaut 	 iful 	 	planet	.
i	thank	you	for	your	attention	.
