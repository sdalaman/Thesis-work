but	we	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	that	 al 	 one 	 	.
they	spring	from	the	same	source	.
the	 art 	 s 	 	and	 science 	 s 	 	are	 avatar 	 s 	 	of	human	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.	it	's	our	attempt	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	to	build	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	the	world	around	us	.
it	's	our	attempt	to	influence	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	internal	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	external	to	us	.
the	 science 	 s 	 	,	to	me	,	are	 manifest 	 ations 	 	of	our	attempt	to	express	our	experience	,	to	influence	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	external	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ly 	 	on	us	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	by	 every 	 one 	 	,	and	the	 art 	 s 	 	manifest	our	 desir 	 e 	 	,	our	attempt	to	share	or	influence	 other 	 s 	 	through	 experience 	 s 	 	that	are	peculiar	to	us	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
let	me	say	it	 aga 	 in 	 	 an 	 other 	 	way	:	of	a	universal	experience	,	and	 art 	 s 	 	 provide 	 s 	 	a	universal	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	a	personal	experience	.
that	's	what	we	have	to	think	about	,	that	they	're	all	part	of	us	,	they	're	all	part	of	a	 continu 	 um 	 	.
it	's	not	just	the	 tool 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	just	the	 science 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	and	the	 numeric 	 al 	 	stuff	and	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	heard	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	on	 th 	 is 	 	stage	,	people	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	music	 be 	 ing 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	.	right	?	 art 	 s 	 	do	n't	just	use	clay	,	are	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	use	clay	,	light	and	sound	and	 move 	 ment 	 	.
they	use	analysis	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	people	might	say	,	well	,	i	still	like	that	intuitive	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 analytic 	 al 	 	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	do	the	right	brain	,	left	brain	thing	,	right	?
we	've	all	 be 	 en 	 	 accus 	 ed 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	right	-	brained	or	left	-	brained	at	some	point	in	time	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	who	we	 disagree 	 d 	 	with	.
you	know	,	people	say	intuitive	,	you	know	that	's	like	you	're	in	touch	with	nature	,	in	touch	with	 your 	 self 	 	and	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
 analytic 	 al 	 	:	you	put	your	mind	to	work	,	and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	little	secret	.	you	all	know	 th 	 is 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	use	 th 	 is 	 	analysis	idea	,	that	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 out 	 side 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	to	be	,	say	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	going	to	 elev 	 ate 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	true	,	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 science 	 s 	 	,	right	?
and	then	you	have	 artist 	 s 	 	,	and	you	all	know	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 artist 	 s 	 	will	say	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 scientist 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	say	they	're	too	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	,	they	're	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	the	world	.
but	,	we	've	even	had	that	here	on	stage	,	so	do	n't	act	like	you	do	n't	know	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
we	had	 folk 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	flat	earth	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	flower	arrangers	,	so	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 d 	 ich 	 otomy 	 	that	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	carry	 a 	 long 	 	,	even	when	we	know	better	.
and	 folk 	 s 	 	say	we	need	to	 choos 	 e 	 	either	or	.
but	it	would	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 fool 	 ish 	 	to	 choos 	 e 	 	either	one	,	right	?
