one	day	a	one	-	eyed	monkey	came	 in 	 to 	 	the	forest	.
under	a	tree	she	saw	a	woman	 medit 	 ating 	 	 fur 	 iously 	 	.
the	one	-	eyed	monkey	 recogn 	 ized 	 	the	woman	,	a	sekhri	.
she	was	the	wife	of	an	even	more	famous	brahmin	.
to	watch	her	better	,	the	one	-	eyed	monkey	 climb 	 ed 	 	onto	the	tree	.
just	then	,	with	a	loud	bang	,	the	 heaven 	 s 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	god	indra	 jump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 clear 	 ing 	 	.
indra	saw	the	woman	,	a	sekhri	.
ah	-	hah	.
the	woman	paid	him	no	 he 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	indra	,	 attract 	 ed 	 	,	threw	her	onto	the	floor	,	and	 proceed 	 ed 	 	to	rape	her	.
then	indra	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	woman	's	husband	,	the	brahmin	,	 appear 	 ed 	 	.
he	 real 	 ized 	 	at	once	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	he	 petition 	 ed 	 	the	 high 	 er 	 	 god 	 s 	 	so	that	he	may	have	justice	.
so	,	the	god	vishnu	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
``	are	there	any	 witness 	 es 	 	?	``
``	just	a	one	-	eyed	monkey	,	``	 s 	 aid 	 	the	brahmin	.
now	,	the	one	-	eyed	monkey	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	for	the	woman	,	a	sekhri	,	to	get	justice	,	so	she	 re 	 told 	 	 event 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
vishnu	 g 	 ave 	 	his	judgment	.
``	the	god	indra	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 in 	 ned 	 	,	in	that	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 in 	 ned 	 	against	...	a	brahmin	.
may	he	be	 call 	 ed 	 	to	wash	away	his	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	indra	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	and	 perform 	 ed 	 	the	sacrifice	of	the	horse	.
and	so	it	 trans 	 pi 	 red 	 	that	a	horse	was	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	a	god	was	made	 s 	 in 	 	-	free	,	a	brahmin	's	ego	was	 app 	 eas 	 ed 	 	,	a	woman	...	was	 ruin 	 ed 	 	,	and	a	one	-	eyed	monkey	was	left	...
 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	at	what	we	 human 	 s 	 	call	justice	.
in	india	there	is	a	rape	every	three	 minute 	 s 	 	.
in	india	,	 on 	 ly 	 	25	percent	of	 rape 	 s 	 	come	to	a	police	station	,	and	of	these	25	percent	that	come	to	a	police	station	,	 convict 	 ions 	 	are	 on 	 ly 	 	in	four	percent	of	the	 case 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	lot	of	women	who	do	n't	get	justice	.
and	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	about	women	.
look	around	you	,	look	at	your	own	 count 	 ries 	 	.
there	is	a	certain	pattern	in	who	 get 	 s 	 	charged	with	 crime 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	in	australia	,	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 ab 	 original 	 s 	 	who	are	in	jail	.
if	you	're	in	india	,	it	's	either	muslims	or	adivasis	,	our	 trib 	 al 	 s 	 	,	the	naxalites	.
if	you	're	in	the	u.s.	,	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	the	 black 	 s 	 	.
there	is	a	trend	here	.
and	the	brahmins	and	the	 god 	 s 	 	,	like	in	my	story	,	 al 	 ways 	 	get	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	truth	 a 	 s 	 	the	truth	.
so	,	have	we	all	 be 	 come 	 	one	-	eyed	--	two	-	eyed	 in 	 stead 	 	of	one	-	eyed	--	 monkey 	 s 	 	?
have	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 in 	 justice 	 	?
good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	i	have	told	 th 	 is 	 	story	close	to	550	 time 	 s 	 	,	in	 audience 	 s 	 	in	40	 count 	 ries 	 	,	to	school	 student 	 s 	 	,	to	black	-	tie	 d 	 inner 	 s 	 	at	the	smithsonian	,	and	so	on	and	so	forth	,	and	every	time	it	 hit 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
now	,	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	same	crowd	and	say	,	``	i	want	to	 lectur 	 e 	 	you	about	justice	and	 in 	 justice 	 	,	``	they	would	say	,	``	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	we	have	other	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	.	``
and	that	is	the	 astonish 	 ing 	 	power	of	art	.
art	can	go	through	where	other	 thing 	 s 	 	ca	n't	.
you	ca	n't	have	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 break 	 s 	 	through	your	 prejudice 	 s 	 	,	 break 	 s 	 	through	 every 	 thing 	 	that	you	have	 a 	 s 	 	your	mask	,	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	am	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	am	that	,	i	am	that	.	``
no	.	it	 break 	 s 	 	through	 t 	 hose 	 	.
and	it	 reach 	 es 	 	 some 	 where 	 	where	other	 thing 	 s 	 	do	n't	.
and	in	a	world	where	 attitude 	 s 	 	are	so	difficult	to	change	,	we	need	a	language	that	 reach 	 es 	 	through	.

for	me	it	came	 ver 	 y 	 	early	.
when	i	was	a	young	child	,	my	mother	,	who	was	a	 choreograph 	 er 	 	,	came	 up 	 on 	 	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	 worri 	 ed 	 	her	.
it	was	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	where	young	 brid 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 commit 	 ting 	 	 su 	 icide 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	gujarat	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 force 	 d 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	money	for	 the 	 ir 	 	in	-	 law 	 s 	 	'	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
and	she	 create 	 d 	 	a	dance	piece	which	then	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	nehru	saw	.
he	came	to	talk	to	her	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	about	?	``
she	told	him	and	he	set	out	the	first	 inquir 	 y 	 	 in 	 to 	 	what	 to 	 day 	 	we	call	 do 	 wry 	 	dance	.
imagine	a	dance	piece	for	the	first	 inquir 	 y 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	even	 to 	 day 	 	 kill 	 s 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	women	.
 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	director	peter	brook	in	``	the	mahabharata	``	 play 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	feisty	 femin 	 ine 	 	feminist	 call 	 ed 	 	draupadi	,	i	had	similar	 experience 	 s 	 	.
big	fat	black	 mama 	 s 	 	in	the	bronx	used	to	come	and	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	girl	,	that	's	it	!	``
and	then	these	 trend 	 y 	 	young	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	sorbonne	would	say	,	``	madame	draupadi	,	on	 n 	 ' 	 est 	 	 pa 	 s 	 	 feminist 	 e 	 	,	mais	ça	?	ça	!	``
and	then	 ab 	 original 	 	women	in	africa	would	come	and	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	!	``
and	i	thought	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	need	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	language	.	``
we	had	 some 	 body 	 	from	public	health	.	and	devdutt	 al 	 so 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	public	health	.
well	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	around	the	world	die	of	 water 	 borne 	 	disease	every	year	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	no	clean	water	to	drink	,	or	in	 count 	 ries 	 	like	india	,	people	do	n't	know	that	they	need	to	soap	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	before	 defec 	 ation 	 	.
so	,	what	do	they	do	?
they	drink	the	water	they	know	is	 dirt 	 y 	 	,	they	get	cholera	,	they	get	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	,	they	get	jaundice	and	they	die	.
and	 government 	 s 	 	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	provide	clean	water	.
they	try	and	build	it	.	they	try	and	build	 pipe 	 lines 	 	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	.
and	the	mncs	give	them	 machine 	 s 	 	that	they	can	not	afford	.
so	what	do	you	do	?	do	you	let	them	die	?
well	,	 some 	 body 	 	had	a	great	idea	.
and	it	was	a	simple	idea	.	it	was	an	idea	that	could	not	profit	 any 	 body 	 	but	would	help	health	in	every	field	.
most	 house 	 s 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	india	have	a	cotton	 gar 	 ment 	 	.
and	it	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	and	who	 endorse 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	a	clean	cotton	 gar 	 ment 	 	 fold 	 ed 	 	eight	 time 	 s 	 	over	,	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	bacteria	up	to	80	percent	from	water	 sieve 	 d 	 	through	.
so	,	why	are	n't	 government 	 s 	 	 b 	 lar 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	?
why	is	n't	it	on	every	 post 	 er 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	third	world	?
 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	no	profit	in	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	can	get	a	 kick 	 back 	 	.
but	it	still	 need 	 s 	 	to	get	to	people	.
and	here	is	one	of	the	ways	we	get	it	to	people	.
[	video	]	woman	:	then	get	me	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 f 	 ancy 	 	water	 pur 	 ifier 	 s 	 	.
man	:	you	know	how	expensive	 t 	 hose 	 	are	.
i	have	a	solution	that	 requir 	 es 	 	 n 	 either 	 	machine	,	nor	wood	,	nor	 cook 	 ing 	 	gas	.
woman	:	what	solution	?
man	:	listen	,	go	fetch	that	cotton	 s 	 ari 	 	you	have	.
boy	:	grand	-	dad	,	tell	me	the	solution	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
man	:	i	will	tell	all	of	you	.	just	wait	.
woman	:	here	father	.	woman	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	of	course	.
man	:	then	do	 a 	 s 	 	i	tell	you	.	fold	the	 s 	 ari 	 	 in 	 to 	 	eight	 fold 	 s 	 	.
woman	:	all	right	,	father	.
man	:	and	you	,	you	count	that	she	 do 	 es 	 	it	right	.

woman	:	here	,	father	,	your	eight	-	 time 	 s 	 	 fold 	 ed 	 	cotton	 s 	 ari 	 	.
man	:	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	cotton	 s 	 ari 	 	.
and	through	 th 	 is 	 	we	will	have	clean	water	.
i	think	it	's	safe	to	say	that	all	of	us	here	are	 deep 	 ly 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	the	 escal 	 ating 	 	violence	in	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
while	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 dev 	 ise 	 	 course 	 s 	 	in	conflict	 re 	 solution 	 	,	and	 government 	 s 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	stop	 skirmish 	 es 	 	at	 border 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	violence	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	road	rage	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	domestic	violence	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	teacher	 beat 	 ing 	 	up	a	student	and	 kill 	 ing 	 	her	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 d 	 one 	 	her	 home 	 work 	 	,	it	's	 every 	 where 	 	.
so	,	why	are	we	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	attend	that	problem	on	a	day	to	day	 bas 	 is 	 	?
what	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	to	try	and	make	children	and	young	people	 real 	 ize 	 	that	violence	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	indulge	in	,	that	we	can	stop	,	and	that	there	are	other	ways	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	taking	violence	,	taking	anger	,	taking	 frust 	 ration 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	different	 thing 	 s 	 	that	do	not	harm	other	people	.

your	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 peace 	 ful 	 	people	.
