i	'm	an	ecologist	,	 most 	 ly 	 	a	coral	reef	ecologist	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	out	in	chesapeake	 ba 	 y 	 	and	went	 div 	 ing 	 	in	the	winter	and	 be 	 came 	 	a	 tropic 	 al 	 	ecologist	 over 	 night 	 	.
and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	for	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	 some 	 body 	 	 pay 	 s 	 	you	to	go	around	and	travel	and	look	at	some	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 place 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	.
and	that	was	what	i	did	.
and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	jamaica	,	in	the	west	indies	,	where	the	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	among	the	most	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	 structural 	 ly 	 	,	that	i	ever	saw	in	my	life	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	picture	here	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	it	 show 	 s 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	first	of	all	,	it	's	in	black	and	white	 be 	 cause 	 	the	water	was	so	clear	and	you	could	see	so	far	,	and	film	was	so	 s 	 low 	 	in	the	1960s	and	early	70s	,	you	took	 picture 	 s 	 	in	black	and	white	.
the	other	thing	it	 show 	 s 	 	you	is	that	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	forest	of	coral	,	there	are	no	fish	in	that	picture	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 reef 	 s 	 	at	 discover 	 y 	 	 ba 	 y 	 	,	jamaica	 we 	 re 	 	the	most	 stud 	 ied 	 	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	in	the	world	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	the	best	and	the	 bright 	 est 	 	.
people	came	to	 stud 	 y 	 	our	 reef 	 s 	 	from	australia	,	which	is	sort	of	funny	 be 	 cause 	 	now	we	go	to	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	.
and	the	view	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	about	how	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	work	,	how	they	ought	to	be	,	was	based	on	these	 reef 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	fish	.
then	,	in	1980	,	there	was	a	hurricane	,	hurricane	allen	.
i	put	half	the	lab	up	in	my	house	.
the	wind	 ble 	 w 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	.
the	 wave 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	25	to	50	feet	high	.
and	the	 reef 	 s 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	and	new	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	thought	,	``	well	,	we	're	real	smart	.
we	know	that	 hurricane 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	.	``
and	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	paper	in	science	,	the	first	time	that	 any 	 body 	 	ever	 de 	 scribed 	 	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	on	a	coral	reef	by	a	major	hurricane	.
and	we	 predict 	 ed 	 	what	would	happen	,	and	we	got	it	all	wrong	.
and	the	reason	was	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	fact	that	a	last	common	 graze 	 r 	 	,	a	sea	urchin	,	 di 	 ed 	 	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	after	that	sea	urchin	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	the	 sea 	 weed 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	grow	.
and	that	is	the	same	reef	;	that	's	the	same	reef	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	;	that	's	the	same	reef	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	of	the	north	coast	of	jamaica	have	a	few	percent	live	coral	cover	and	a	lot	of	 sea 	 weed 	 	and	 s 	 lime 	 	.
and	that	's	more	or	less	the	story	of	the	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	of	the	caribbean	,	and	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	 tragic 	 ally 	 	,	the	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
now	,	that	's	my	little	,	 depress 	 ing 	 	story	.
all	of	us	in	our	60s	and	70s	have	 compar 	 able 	 	 depress 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
there	are	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	out	there	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	conjure	up	much	of	a	sense	of	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	just	 keep 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
and	the	reason	it	 keep 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	is	that	after	a	natural	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	like	a	hurricane	,	it	used	to	be	that	there	was	some	kind	of	 success 	 ional 	 	sequence	of	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	,	but	what	's	going	on	now	is	that	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	and	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	climate	change	are	all	 interact 	 ing 	 	in	a	way	that	 prevent 	 s 	 	that	.
and	so	i	'm	going	to	sort	of	go	through	and	talk	about	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	hear	a	lot	about	the	collapse	of	cod	.
it	's	difficult	to	imagine	that	two	,	or	some	 historian 	 s 	 	would	say	three	world	 war 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 f 	 ought 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	colonial	era	for	the	control	of	cod	.
cod	fed	most	of	the	people	of	western	europe	.
it	fed	the	 slave 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	the	antilles	,	the	song	``	jamaica	 fare 	 well 	 	``	--	``	ackee	rice	salt	fish	are	nice	``	--	is	an	emblem	of	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	salt	cod	from	 north 	 eastern 	 	canada	.
it	all	 collapse 	 d 	 	in	the	80s	and	the	90s	:	35,000	people	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
and	that	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	a	kind	of	 s 	 erial 	 	 deple 	 tion 	 	from	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 ta 	 s 	 tier 	 	species	to	 small 	 er 	 	and	not	-	so	-	tasty	species	,	from	species	that	 we 	 re 	 	near	to	home	to	species	that	 we 	 re 	 	all	around	the	world	,	and	what	have	you	.
it	's	a	little	hard	to	understand	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	go	to	a	costco	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	buy	cheap	fish	.
you	ought	to	read	the	label	to	find	out	where	it	came	from	,	but	it	's	still	cheap	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
it	's	hard	to	communicate	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	one	way	that	i	think	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	to	talk	about	 s 	 port 	 	fish	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	like	to	go	out	and	catch	fish	.
it	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	here	 show 	 s 	 	the	trophy	fish	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	fish	caught	by	people	who	pay	a	lot	of	money	to	get	on	a	boat	,	go	to	a	place	off	of	key	west	in	florida	,	drink	a	lot	of	beer	,	throw	a	lot	of	 hook 	 s 	 	and	lines	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	,	come	back	with	the	 big 	 gest 	 	and	the	best	fish	,	and	the	champion	trophy	fish	are	put	on	 th 	 is 	 	board	,	where	people	take	a	picture	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	that	fish	.
well	,	that	's	what	it	's	like	now	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	was	like	in	the	1950s	from	the	same	boat	in	the	same	place	on	the	same	board	on	the	same	dock	.
the	trophy	fish	 we 	 re 	 	so	big	that	you	could	n't	put	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	small	fish	up	on	it	.
and	the	average	 s 	 ize 	 	trophy	fish	 weigh 	 ed 	 	250	to	300	 pound 	 s 	 	,	 golia 	 th 	 	 group 	 er 	 	,	and	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	out	and	kill	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	could	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	count	on	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	catch	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	fish	.
and	they	 taste 	 d 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
and	people	paid	less	in	1950	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	catch	that	than	what	people	pay	now	to	catch	 t 	 hose 	 	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	fish	.
and	that	's	 every 	 where 	 	.
it	's	not	just	the	fish	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	that	are	 disappear 	 ing 	 	.
industrial	 fish 	 ing 	 	uses	big	stuff	,	big	 machine 	 ry 	 	.
we	use	 net 	 s 	 	that	are	20	 mile 	 s 	 	long	.
we	use	 long 	 lines 	 	that	have	one	million	or	two	million	 hook 	 s 	 	.
and	we	trawl	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	to	take	 some 	 thing 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 tract 	 or 	 	 trail 	 er 	 	truck	that	 weigh 	 s 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 pound 	 s 	 	,	put	it	on	a	big	chain	,	and	drag	it	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sea	floor	to	stir	up	the	bottom	and	catch	the	fish	.
think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	kind	of	the	 bull 	 doz 	 ing 	 	of	a	city	or	of	a	forest	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 clear 	 s 	 	it	away	.
and	the	 habit 	 at 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	is	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	,	a	typical	photograph	,	of	what	the	 continent 	 al 	 	 shelv 	 es 	 	of	the	world	look	like	.
you	can	see	the	 row 	 s 	 	in	the	bottom	,	the	way	you	can	see	the	 row 	 s 	 	in	a	field	that	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	 plow 	 ed 	 	to	plant	corn	.
what	that	was	,	was	a	forest	of	 sponge 	 s 	 	and	coral	,	which	is	a	critical	 habit 	 at 	 	for	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	fish	.
what	it	is	now	is	mud	,	and	the	area	of	the	ocean	floor	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	from	forest	to	level	mud	,	to	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	,	is	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	the	entire	area	of	all	the	 forest 	 s 	 	that	have	ever	 be 	 en 	 	cut	down	on	all	of	the	earth	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
we	've	 manage 	 d 	 	to	do	that	in	the	last	100	to	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	tend	to	think	of	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	and	 merc 	 ury 	 	and	we	hear	a	lot	about	plastic	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	all	of	that	stuff	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 disgust 	 ing 	 	,	but	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 insid 	 ious 	 	is	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 magn 	 itude 	 	of	the	 shift 	 s 	 	that	it	 cause 	 s 	 	to	entire	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	just	talk	 ver 	 y 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	about	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	:	one	is	 introduc 	 ed 	 	species	and	the	other	is	what	 come 	 s 	 	from	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 in 	 famous 	 	caulerpa	 taxi 	 folia 	 	,	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	killer	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	.
a	book	was	written	about	it	.
it	's	a	bit	of	an	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	.
it	was	 accident 	 ally 	 	released	from	the	 aqua 	 rium 	 	in	monaco	,	it	was	 br 	 ed 	 	to	be	cold	 toler 	 ant 	 	to	have	in	 people 	 s 	 	 aqua 	 ria 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 over 	 grow 	 	the	once	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	the	 north 	 western 	 	mediterranean	.
i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	remember	the	movie	``	the	little	shop	of	 horr 	 ors 	 	,	``	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	plant	of	``	the	little	shop	of	 horr 	 ors 	 	.	``
but	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 devour 	 ing 	 	the	people	in	the	shop	,	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 over 	 growing 	 	and	 s 	 mother 	 ing 	 	 virtual 	 ly 	 	all	of	the	bottom	-	dwelling	life	of	the	entire	 north 	 western 	 	mediterranean	sea	.
we	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	that	eats	it	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 genetic 	 s 	 	and	figure	out	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	but	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 stand 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	 mon 	 ster 	 	from	hell	,	about	which	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	what	to	do	.
now	 an 	 other 	 	form	of	 poll 	 ution 	 	that	's	 bio 	 logical 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	from	excess	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
the	green	revolution	,	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	artificial	nitrogen	 fertil 	 izer 	 	,	we	use	too	much	of	it	.
it	's	 subsidize 	 d 	 	,	which	is	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	we	used	too	much	of	it	.
it	 run 	 s 	 	down	the	 river 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 feed 	 s 	 	the	plankton	,	the	little	 micro 	 scopic 	 	plant	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	 coast 	 al 	 	water	.
but	since	we	ate	all	the	 oyster 	 s 	 	and	we	ate	all	the	fish	that	would	eat	the	plankton	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	eat	the	plankton	and	there	's	more	and	more	of	it	,	so	it	dies	of	old	age	,	which	is	 un 	 heard 	 	of	for	plankton	.
and	when	it	dies	,	it	 fall 	 s 	 	to	the	bottom	and	then	it	 rot 	 s 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	bacteria	break	it	down	.
and	in	the	process	they	use	up	all	the	oxygen	,	and	in	using	up	all	the	oxygen	they	make	the	environment	 utter 	 ly 	 	lethal	for	 any 	 thing 	 	that	ca	n't	swim	away	.
so	,	what	we	end	up	with	is	a	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	zoo	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	bacteria	and	 jelly 	 fish 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	on	the	left	in	front	of	you	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 fish 	 ery 	 	left	--	and	it	is	a	commercial	 fish 	 ery 	 	--	is	the	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 fish 	 ery 	 	you	see	on	the	right	,	where	there	used	to	be	prawns	.
even	in	newfoundland	where	we	used	to	catch	cod	,	we	now	have	a	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 fish 	 ery 	 	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	is	what	is	often	 call 	 ed 	 	red	 tide 	 s 	 	or	toxic	 bloom 	 s 	 	.
that	picture	on	the	left	is	just	 stagger 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
i	have	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	a	million	 time 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
in	the	upper	right	of	that	picture	on	the	left	is	 al 	 most 	 	the	mississippi	 del 	 ta 	 	,	and	the	lower	left	of	that	picture	is	the	texas	-	mexico	border	.
you	're	looking	at	the	entire	 north 	 western 	 	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	;	you	're	looking	at	one	toxic	 dinofla 	 gel 	 late 	 	bloom	that	can	kill	fish	,	made	by	that	 beaut 	 iful 	 	little	creature	on	the	lower	right	.
and	in	the	upper	right	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	black	sort	of	cloud	moving	 a 	 shore 	 	.
that	's	the	same	species	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	shore	and	the	wind	 blow 	 s 	 	,	and	little	 drop 	 lets 	 	of	the	water	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	,	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	rooms	of	all	the	 hospital 	 s 	 	fill	up	with	people	with	 a 	 cute 	 	 respirator 	 y 	 	 di 	 stress 	 	.
and	that	's	 retire 	 ment 	 	 home 	 s 	 	on	the	west	coast	of	florida	.
a	friend	and	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	thing	in	hollywood	we	 call 	 ed 	 	hollywood	ocean	night	,	and	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	explain	to	 act 	 ors 	 	what	's	going	on	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	,	imagine	you	're	in	a	movie	 call 	 ed 	 	'	 es 	 cape 	 	from	malibu	'	 be 	 cause 	 	all	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	people	have	 move 	 d 	 	to	north	dakota	,	where	it	's	clean	and	safe	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	who	are	left	there	are	the	people	who	ca	n't	afford	to	move	away	from	the	coast	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	coast	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	,	is	 harm 	 ful 	 	to	your	health	.	``
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	when	i	was	on	 holi 	 day 	 	last	early	 aut 	 umn 	 	in	france	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	the	coast	of	brittany	,	which	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 envelop 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	green	,	 al 	 gal 	 	 s 	 lime 	 	.
the	reason	that	it	 attract 	 ed 	 	so	much	attention	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	the	fact	that	it	's	 disgust 	 ing 	 	,	is	that	sea	 bird 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	over	it	are	 asphyxi 	 ated 	 	by	the	smell	and	die	,	and	a	 farm 	 er 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	of	it	,	and	you	can	imagine	the	scandal	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	war	between	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	and	the	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	about	it	all	,	and	the	net	result	is	that	the	 beach 	 es 	 	of	brittany	have	to	be	 bulldoze 	 d 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	there	's	climate	change	,	and	we	all	know	about	climate	change	.
i	guess	the	 icon 	 ic 	 	figure	of	it	is	the	 melt 	 ing 	 	of	the	ice	in	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	sea	.
think	about	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	who	 di 	 ed 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	 north 	 west 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	.
well	,	the	 north 	 west 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	there	.
i	think	it	's	sort	of	funny	;	it	's	on	the	siberian	coast	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	russians	will	charge	 toll 	 s 	 	.
the	 government 	 s 	 	of	the	world	are	taking	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
the	 militar 	 y 	 	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	is	taking	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
for	all	the	 deni 	 al 	 	of	climate	change	by	government	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	the	cia	and	the	 nav 	 ies 	 	of	norway	and	the	u.s.	and	canada	,	 what 	 ever 	 	are	 bus 	 ily 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	they	will	secure	 the 	 ir 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 inevit 	 ability 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	point	of	view	.
and	,	of	course	,	 arc 	 tic 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	are	toast	.
the	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 effect 	 s 	 	of	climate	change	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	coral	 bleach 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	picture	,	right	?
all	that	white	coral	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	it	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 brow 	 n 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 coral 	 s 	 	are	a	 sym 	 bio 	 sis 	 	,	and	they	have	these	little	 al 	 gal 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	that	live	 in 	 side 	 	them	.
and	the	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	give	the	 coral 	 s 	 	sugar	,	and	the	 coral 	 s 	 	give	the	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	and	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
but	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	too	hot	,	the	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	ca	n't	make	the	sugar	.
the	 coral 	 s 	 	say	,	``	you	 cheat 	 ed 	 	.	you	did	n't	pay	your	rent	.	``
they	kick	them	out	,	and	then	they	die	.
not	all	of	them	die	;	some	of	them	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	some	more	are	 surviv 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	news	.
to	try	and	give	you	a	sense	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	imagine	you	go	 camp 	 ing 	 	in	july	 some 	 where 	 	in	europe	or	in	north	america	,	and	you	wake	up	the	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	look	around	you	,	and	you	see	that	80	percent	of	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	have	 drop 	 ped 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	and	are	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	naked	.
and	you	come	home	,	and	you	discover	that	80	percent	of	all	the	 tree 	 s 	 	in	north	america	and	in	europe	have	 drop 	 ped 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	.
and	then	you	read	in	the	paper	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	``	oh	,	by	the	way	,	a	quarter	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	.	``
well	,	that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	indian	ocean	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	1998	el	nino	,	an	area	 vast 	 ly 	 	 great 	 er 	 	than	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	north	america	and	europe	,	when	80	percent	of	all	the	 coral 	 s 	 	 bleach 	 ed 	 	and	a	quarter	of	them	 di 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	thing	about	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	the	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	the	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	the	climate	change	--	is	that	each	thing	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	in	a	vacuum	.
but	there	are	these	,	what	we	call	,	positive	 feed 	 back 	 s 	 	,	the	 syn 	 er 	 gie 	 s 	 	among	them	that	make	the	whole	 vast 	 ly 	 	 great 	 er 	 	than	the	sum	of	the	 part 	 s 	 	.
and	the	great	scientific	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	people	like	me	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	is	do	we	know	how	to	put	 hump 	 ty 	 	 dump 	 ty 	 	back	together	 aga 	 in 	 	?
i	mean	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	we	can	protect	it	.
but	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	know	.
so	what	are	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	going	to	be	like	in	20	or	50	 year 	 s 	 	?
well	,	there	wo	n't	be	any	fish	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 min 	 now 	 s 	 	,	and	the	water	will	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	,	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	and	full	of	 merc 	 ury 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
and	dead	 zone 	 s 	 	will	get	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	and	they	'll	start	to	merge	,	and	we	can	imagine	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	dead	-	zonification	of	the	global	,	 coast 	 al 	 	ocean	.
then	you	 s 	 ure 	 	wo	n't	want	to	eat	fish	that	 we 	 re 	 	raised	in	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	would	be	a	kind	of	gastronomic	russian	 ro 	 ul 	 ette 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	have	a	toxic	bloom	;	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	.
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sell	.
the	 re 	 ally 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	are	the	physical	,	chemical	,	 ocean 	 o 	 graphic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	surface	of	the	ocean	 get 	 s 	 	 warm 	 er 	 	,	the	water	is	 light 	 er 	 	when	it	's	 warm 	 er 	 	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	and	 hard 	 er 	 	to	turn	the	ocean	over	.
we	say	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	 strong 	 ly 	 	 strat 	 ified 	 	.
the	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	that	is	that	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	that	fuel	the	great	 anchov 	 e 	 ta 	 	 fish 	 eries 	 	,	of	the	 s 	 ard 	 ine 	 s 	 	of	california	or	in	peru	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 low 	 	down	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 fish 	 eries 	 	collapse	.
and	,	at	the	same	time	,	water	from	the	surface	,	which	is	rich	in	oxygen	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	it	down	and	the	ocean	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	desert	.
so	the	question	is	:	how	are	we	all	going	to	respond	to	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	we	can	do	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	fix	it	,	but	in	the	final	analysis	,	the	thing	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	fix	is	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
it	's	not	about	the	fish	;	it	's	not	about	the	 poll 	 ution 	 	;	it	's	not	about	the	climate	change	.
it	's	about	us	and	our	greed	and	our	need	for	growth	and	our	 in 	 ability 	 	to	imagine	a	world	that	is	different	from	the	 self 	 ish 	 	world	we	live	in	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	the	question	is	:	will	we	respond	to	 th 	 is 	 	or	not	?
i	would	say	that	the	future	of	life	and	the	dignity	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	our	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
thank	you	.
