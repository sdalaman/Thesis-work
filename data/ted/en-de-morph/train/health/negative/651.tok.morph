what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	here	to	talk	about	is	the	``	how	.	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	how	 exact 	 ly 	 	do	we	create	 th 	 is 	 	world	-	 shatter 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	will	,	 innov 	 ation 	 	?
now	,	i	want	to	tell	you	a	quick	story	.
we	'll	go	back	a	little	more	than	a	year	.
in	fact	,	the	date	--	i	'm	 cur 	 ious 	 	to	know	if	any	of	you	know	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 moment 	 ous 	 	date	?
it	was	february	3rd	,	2008	.
 any 	 one 	 	remember	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	february	3rd	,	2008	?
super	bowl	.	i	heard	it	over	here	.	it	was	the	date	of	the	super	bowl	.
and	the	reason	that	 th 	 is 	 	date	was	so	 moment 	 ous 	 	is	that	what	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	john	king	and	halee	fischer	-	wright	,	and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 de 	 brief 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	super	bowl	 part 	 ies 	 	,	is	that	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	us	that	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	if	you	will	,	 trib 	 al 	 	 council 	 s 	 	had	 conven 	 ed 	 	.
and	they	had	 discuss 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	of	great	national	 import 	 ance 	 	.
like	,	``	do	we	like	the	budweiser	commercial	?	``
and	,	``	do	we	like	the	nachos	?	``	and	,	``	who	is	going	to	win	?	``
but	they	 al 	 so 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	which	 candid 	 ate 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	support	.
and	if	you	go	back	in	time	to	february	3rd	,	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	hilary	clinton	was	going	to	get	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 nomi 	 nation 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	even	some	 poll 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	she	was	going	to	go	all	the	way	.
but	when	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	people	,	it	 appear 	 ed 	 	that	a	funnel	effect	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	these	 tribe 	 s 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
now	what	is	a	tribe	?	a	tribe	is	a	group	of	about	20	--	so	kind	of	more	than	a	team	--	20	to	about	150	people	.
and	it	's	 with 	 in 	 	these	 tribe 	 s 	 	that	all	of	our	work	 get 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
but	not	just	work	.	it	's	 with 	 in 	 	these	 tribe 	 s 	 	that	 socie 	 ties 	 	get	built	,	that	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
and	so	 a 	 s 	 	we	 survey 	 ed 	 	the	,	if	you	will	,	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	from	 vari 	 ous 	 	 trib 	 al 	 	 council 	 s 	 	that	met	,	 al 	 so 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	super	bowl	 part 	 ies 	 	,	we	 s 	 ent 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	email	off	to	40	 news 	 paper 	 	 editor 	 s 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	day	.
february	4th	,	we	 post 	 ed 	 	it	on	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	before	super	tuesday	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	 tribe 	 s 	 	that	we	're	in	are	 say 	 ing 	 	it	's	going	to	be	obama	.	``
now	,	the	reason	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	was	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 s 	 pent 	 	the	previous	10	 year 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 tribe 	 s 	 	,	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	these	 natural 	 ly 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	 group 	 s 	 	.
all	of	you	are	 member 	 s 	 	of	 tribe 	 s 	 	.
in	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	at	the	break	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	had	met	 member 	 s 	 	of	your	tribe	.	and	you	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	them	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	what	great	,	if	you	will	,	 trib 	 al 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	do	,	which	is	to	find	 some 	 one 	 	who	is	a	member	of	a	tribe	,	and	to	find	 some 	 one 	 	else	who	is	 an 	 other 	 	member	of	a	different	tribe	,	and	make	 introduc 	 tions 	 	.
that	is	in	fact	what	great	 trib 	 al 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	do	.
so	here	is	the	bottom	line	.
if	you	focus	in	on	a	group	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	a	usc	game	--	and	you	zoom	in	with	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	super	satellite	 camera 	 s 	 	and	do	 magnific 	 ation 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	so	you	could	see	individual	people	,	you	would	in	fact	see	not	a	single	crowd	,	just	like	there	is	not	a	single	crowd	here	,	but	you	would	see	these	 tribe 	 s 	 	that	are	then	coming	together	.
and	from	a	distance	it	 appear 	 s 	 	that	it	's	a	single	group	.
and	so	people	form	 tribe 	 s 	 	.
they	 al 	 ways 	 	have	.	they	 al 	 ways 	 	will	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	fish	swim	and	 bird 	 s 	 	fly	,	people	form	 tribe 	 s 	 	.	it	's	just	what	we	do	.
but	here	's	the	rub	.
not	all	 tribe 	 s 	 	are	the	same	,	and	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	the	culture	.
now	here	is	the	net	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	're	all	a	member	of	 tribe 	 s 	 	.
if	you	can	find	a	way	to	take	the	 tribe 	 s 	 	that	you	're	in	and	nudge	them	forward	,	 a 	 long 	 	these	 trib 	 al 	 	 stage 	 s 	 	to	what	we	call	stage	five	,	which	is	the	top	of	the	mountain	.
but	we	're	going	to	start	with	what	we	call	stage	one	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 low 	 est 	 	of	the	 stage 	 s 	 	.
you	do	n't	want	 th 	 is 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bit	of	a	difficult	image	to	put	up	on	the	screen	.
but	it	's	one	that	i	think	we	need	to	learn	from	.
stage	one	 produce 	 s 	 	people	who	do	 horr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kid	who	shot	up	virginia	tech	.
stage	one	is	a	group	where	people	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	 s 	 ever 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	from	functional	 tribe 	 s 	 	,	and	then	pool	together	with	people	who	think	like	they	do	.
stage	one	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	culture	of	 gang 	 s 	 	and	it	is	the	culture	of	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	do	n't	often	deal	with	stage	one	.
and	i	want	to	make	the	point	that	 a 	 s 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	we	need	to	.
it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 simpl 	 y 	 	write	people	off	.
but	let	's	move	on	to	stage	two	.
now	,	stage	one	,	you	'll	notice	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	in	effect	,	``	life	 suck 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	other	book	that	steve	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	that	just	came	out	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	three	 law 	 s 	 	of	performance	,	``	my	 col 	 league 	 	,	steve	zaffron	and	i	,	 argu 	 e 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	people	see	the	world	,	so	they	 behav 	 e 	 	.
well	,	if	people	see	the	world	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	life	 suck 	 s 	 	,	then	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	will	follow	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	from	that	.
it	will	be	 despair 	 ing 	 	 hostil 	 ity 	 	.
they	'll	do	 what 	 ever 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	even	if	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 under 	 min 	 ing 	 	other	people	.
now	,	my	 birth 	 day 	 	is	coming	up	 short 	 ly 	 	,	and	my	driver	's	 licens 	 e 	 	 expir 	 es 	 	.
and	the	reason	that	that	's	relevant	is	that	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	i	will	be	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	what	we	call	a	stage	two	tribe	,	which	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	am	i	 say 	 ing 	 	that	in	every	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	motor	 vehicle 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	land	,	you	find	a	stage	two	culture	?
no	.	but	in	the	one	near	me	,	where	i	have	to	go	in	just	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	what	i	will	say	when	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	line	is	,	``	how	can	people	be	so	dumb	,	and	yet	live	?	``
now	,	am	i	 say 	 ing 	 	that	there	are	dumb	people	 work 	 ing 	 	here	?
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	no	,	i	'm	not	.
but	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	the	culture	 make 	 s 	 	people	dumb	.
so	in	a	stage	two	culture	--	and	we	find	these	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	different	 place 	 s 	 	--	you	find	them	,	in	fact	,	in	the	best	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
you	find	them	in	all	 place 	 s 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
i	've	come	 a 	 cross 	 	them	at	the	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 rave 	 s 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	best	in	class	.
but	here	is	the	point	.	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	and	you	say	to	people	in	your	tribe	,	in	effect	,	``	my	life	 suck 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	if	i	got	to	go	to	 ted 	 x 	 	usc	my	life	would	n't	suck	.	but	i	do	n't	.	so	it	 do 	 es 	 	.	``
if	that	's	how	you	 talk 	 ed 	 	,	imagine	what	kind	of	work	would	get	 d 	 one 	 	.
what	kind	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	would	get	 d 	 one 	 	?
the	amount	of	world	-	changing	behavior	that	would	happen	?
in	fact	it	would	be	 bas 	 ically 	 	 n 	 il 	 	.
now	when	we	go	on	to	stage	three	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	one	that	 hit 	 s 	 	 close 	 st 	 	to	home	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	in	stage	three	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	move	.
and	we	park	.	and	we	stay	.
stage	three	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	great	.	and	you	're	not	.	``
i	'm	great	and	you	're	not	.
now	imagine	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	whole	room	of	people	 say 	 ing 	 	,	in	effect	,	``	i	'm	great	and	you	're	not	.	``
or	,	``	i	'm	going	to	find	some	way	to	compete	with	you	and	come	out	on	top	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	.	``
a	whole	group	of	people	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	that	way	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	that	way	.
i	know	 th 	 is 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	joke	.	three	 doctor 	 s 	 	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	bar	.
but	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	three	 doctor 	 s 	 	walk	 in 	 to 	 	an	 elev 	 ator 	 	.
i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	data	for	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
and	one	doctor	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	 other 	 s 	 	,	``	did	you	see	my	article	in	the	new	england	journal	of	medicine	?	``
and	the	other	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	.	that	's	great	.	 congratula 	 tions 	 	!	``
the	next	one	got	kind	of	a	wry	 s 	 mile 	 	on	his	face	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	while	you	 we 	 re 	 	,	you	know	,	 do 	 ing 	 	your	research	,	``	--	notice	the	 con 	 descend 	 ing 	 	tone	--	``	while	you	 we 	 re 	 	off	 do 	 ing 	 	your	research	,	i	was	off	 do 	 ing 	 	more	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	than	 any 	 one 	 	else	in	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	institution	.	``
and	the	third	one	got	the	same	wry	 s 	 mile 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	while	you	 we 	 re 	 	off	 do 	 ing 	 	your	research	,	and	you	 we 	 re 	 	off	 do 	 ing 	 	your	monkey	 meat 	 ball 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	that	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	we	'll	train	 monkey 	 s 	 	to	do	,	or	 cell 	 s 	 	or	 robot 	 s 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	not	even	need	to	do	it	at	all	,	i	was	off	running	the	future	of	the	 re 	 side 	 ncy 	 	program	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	future	of	medicine	.	``
and	they	all	kind	of	 laugh 	 ed 	 	and	they	 pat 	 ted 	 	him	on	the	back	.
and	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	door	 open 	 ed 	 	,	and	they	all	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	.
that	is	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	of	a	stage	three	tribe	.
now	,	we	find	these	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	,	 success 	 ful 	 	people	show	up	.
like	,	oh	,	i	do	n't	know	,	 ted 	 x 	 	usc	.
here	is	the	 great 	 est 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	we	face	in	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
it	is	moving	from	stage	three	to	stage	four	.
let	's	take	a	look	at	a	quick	video	 snip 	 pet 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	zappos	,	 locate 	 d 	 	 out 	 side 	 	las	vegas	.
and	my	question	on	the	other	side	is	just	going	to	be	,	``	what	do	you	think	they	value	?	``
it	was	not	christmas	time	.	there	was	a	christmas	tree	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	lobby	.
 employ 	 ees 	 	volunteer	time	in	the	 ad 	 vice 	 	booth	.
notice	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	a	 peanut 	 s 	 	cartoon	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	're	going	through	the	 hall 	 way 	 	here	at	zappos	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	call	center	.	notice	how	it	's	 decor 	 ated 	 	.
notice	people	are	 applaud 	 ing 	 	for	us	.
they	do	n't	know	who	we	are	and	they	do	n't	care	.	and	if	they	did	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	n't	applaud	.
but	you	'll	notice	the	level	of	 excit 	 ement 	 	.
notice	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	how	they	 decor 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	.
now	,	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	people	at	zappos	,	these	may	not	be	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 import 	 ant 	 	to	you	.
but	they	value	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 f 	 un 	 	.	and	they	value	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 state 	 d 	 	 value 	 s 	 	is	,	``	be	a	little	bit	weird	.	``
and	you	'll	notice	they	are	a	little	bit	weird	.
so	when	 individual 	 s 	 	come	together	and	find	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 un 	 ites 	 	them	that	's	 great 	 er 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	individual	 compete 	 nce 	 	,	then	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
the	group	 gel 	 s 	 	.	and	it	 change 	 s 	 	from	a	group	of	 high 	 ly 	 	 motiv 	 ated 	 	but	 fair 	 ly 	 	 individual 	 ly 	 	-	centric	people	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 large 	 r 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	tribe	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	aware	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
stage	four	 tribe 	 s 	 	can	do	 remark 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	you	'll	notice	we	're	not	at	the	top	of	the	mountain	yet	.
there	is	,	in	fact	,	 an 	 other 	 	stage	.
now	,	some	of	you	may	not	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	scene	that	's	up	here	.
and	if	you	take	a	look	at	the	 head 	 line 	 	of	stage	five	,	which	is	``	life	is	great	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	may	seem	a	little	 incongr 	 uous 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	scene	or	 snip 	 pet 	 	from	the	truth	and	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	process	in	south	africa	for	which	desmond	tutu	won	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	.
now	think	about	that	.	south	africa	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	 atro 	 cities 	 	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	people	came	together	focused	 on 	 ly 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 value 	 s 	 	:	truth	and	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	.
there	was	no	road	map	.	no	one	had	ever	 d 	 one 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	before	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	atmosphere	,	where	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 gui 	 dance 	 	was	people	's	 value 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	noble	cause	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	group	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	was	historic	.
and	people	,	at	the	time	,	 fear 	 ed 	 	that	south	africa	would	end	up	going	the	way	that	rwanda	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	,	 descend 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	skirmish	after	 an 	 other 	 	in	a	civil	war	that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	no	end	.
in	fact	,	south	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	not	gone	down	that	road	.
 large 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	like	desmond	tutu	set	up	a	stage	five	process	to	involve	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 tribe 	 s 	 	in	the	country	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 every 	 one 	 	together	.
so	,	people	hear	 th 	 is 	 	and	they	conclude	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	did	we	in	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 stud 	 y 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	got	it	.	i	do	n't	want	to	talk	stage	one	.
that	's	like	,	you	know	,	``	life	 suck 	 s 	 	.	``	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	talk	that	way	?
i	do	n't	want	to	talk	like	they	do	at	the	 part 	 icular 	 	dmv	that	's	close	to	where	dave	 live 	 s 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	want	to	just	say	``	i	'm	great	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	that	kind	of	 sound 	 s 	 	 narcissist 	 ic 	 	,	and	then	i	wo	n't	have	any	 friend 	 s 	 	.
 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	're	great	``	--	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
but	i	should	 re 	 ally 	 	talk	stage	five	,	right	?	``	life	is	great	.	``
well	,	in	fact	,	there	are	three	 some 	 what 	 	counter	-	intuitive	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	come	out	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	first	one	,	if	you	look	at	the	 decla 	 ration 	 	of	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	read	it	,	the	phrase	that	 stick 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 mind 	 s 	 	is	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 in 	 alien 	 able 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	that	's	stage	five	,	right	?	life	is	great	,	oriented	 on 	 ly 	 	by	our	 value 	 s 	 	,	no	other	 gui 	 dance 	 	.
in	fact	,	most	of	the	document	is	written	at	stage	two	.
``	my	life	 suck 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	live	under	a	 ty 	 rant 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	king	george	.
we	're	great	!	who	is	not	great	?	england	!	``
sorry	.
well	,	what	about	other	great	 lead 	 ers 	 	?	what	about	gandhi	?
what	about	martin	luther	king	?
i	mean	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	these	 we 	 re 	 	just	people	who	 preach 	 ed 	 	,	``	life	is	great	,	``	right	?
just	one	little	bit	of	happiness	and	joy	after	 an 	 other 	 	.
in	fact	,	martin	luther	king	's	most	famous	line	was	at	stage	three	.
he	did	n't	say	``	we	have	a	dream	.	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	a	dream	.	``
why	did	he	do	that	?	 be 	 cause 	 	most	people	are	not	at	stage	five	.
two	percent	are	at	stage	one	.
about	25	percent	are	at	stage	two	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	in	effect	,	``	my	life	 suck 	 s 	 	.	``
48	percent	of	 work 	 ing 	 	 tribe 	 s 	 	say	,	these	are	 employ 	 ed 	 	 tribe 	 s 	 	,	say	,	``	i	'm	great	and	you	're	not	.	``
and	we	have	to	 du 	 ke 	 	it	out	every	day	,	so	we	resort	to	 politic 	 s 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	about	22	percent	of	 tribe 	 s 	 	are	at	stage	four	,	oriented	by	our	 value 	 s 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	``	we	're	great	.
and	our	 value 	 s 	 	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	 un 	 ite 	 	us	.	``
 on 	 ly 	 	two	percent	,	 on 	 ly 	 	two	percent	of	 tribe 	 s 	 	get	to	stage	five	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	change	the	world	.
so	the	first	little	 find 	 ing 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 lead 	 ers 	 	need	to	be	able	to	talk	all	the	 level 	 s 	 	so	that	you	can	touch	every	person	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
but	you	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	them	where	you	found	them	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
 tribe 	 s 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	hear	one	level	above	and	 be 	 low 	 	where	they	are	.
so	we	have	to	have	the	ability	to	talk	all	the	 level 	 s 	 	,	to	go	to	where	they	are	.
and	then	 lead 	 ers 	 	nudge	people	 with 	 in 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tribe 	 s 	 	to	the	next	level	.
i	'd	like	to	show	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	of	the	people	we	 interview 	 ed 	 	was	frank	jordan	,	 form 	 er 	 	mayor	of	san	francisco	.	before	that	he	was	chief	of	police	in	san	francisco	.
and	he	grew	up	 essential 	 ly 	 	in	stage	one	.
and	you	know	what	 change 	 d 	 	his	life	?	it	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	these	,	a	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	club	.
now	here	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	person	who	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	mayor	of	san	francisco	.
he	went	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	and	passionate	at	stage	one	--	remember	,	``	life	 suck 	 s 	 	,	 despair 	 ing 	 	 hostil 	 ity 	 	,	i	will	do	 what 	 ever 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	``	--	to	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	club	,	 fold 	 ing 	 	his	 arm 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	down	in	a	chair	,	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	.	my	life	 re 	 ally 	 	 suck 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	 any 	 body 	 	.
i	mean	,	if	i	was	 in 	 to 	 	 box 	 ing 	 	,	like	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	then	my	life	would	n't	suck	.	but	i	do	n't	.	so	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	 s 	 it 	 	here	in	my	chair	and	not	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``
in	fact	,	that	's	progress	.
we	move	people	from	stage	one	to	stage	two	by	 get 	 ting 	 	them	in	a	new	tribe	and	then	,	over	time	,	 get 	 ting 	 	them	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	what	about	moving	from	stage	three	to	stage	four	?
i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	right	here	.
ted	 represent 	 s 	 	a	set	of	 value 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 un 	 ite 	 	around	these	 value 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	to	emerge	.
if	you	want	 th 	 is 	 	experience	to	live	on	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	historic	,	then	at	the	 re 	 ception 	 	 to 	 night 	 	i	'd	like	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	beyond	what	people	 normal 	 ly 	 	do	and	call	 network 	 ing 	 	.
which	is	not	just	to	meet	new	people	and	extend	your	reach	,	extend	your	influence	,	but	 in 	 stead 	 	,	find	 some 	 one 	 	you	do	n't	know	,	and	find	 some 	 one 	 	else	you	do	n't	know	,	and	 introduc 	 e 	 	them	.
that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	triadic	relationship	.
see	,	people	who	build	world	-	changing	 tribe 	 s 	 	do	that	.
they	extend	the	reach	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 tribe 	 s 	 	by	 connect 	 ing 	 	them	,	not	just	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	so	that	my	 follow 	 ing 	 	is	 great 	 er 	 	,	but	i	connect	people	who	do	n't	know	each	other	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 great 	 er 	 	than	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	that	 add 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 value 	 s 	 	.
but	we	're	not	 d 	 one 	 	yet	.	 be 	 cause 	 	then	how	do	we	go	from	stage	four	,	which	is	great	,	to	stage	five	?
the	story	that	i	like	to	end	with	is	 th 	 is 	 	.	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	the	gallup	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
you	know	they	do	 poll 	 s 	 	,	right	?
so	it	's	stage	four	.	we	're	great	.	who	is	not	great	?
 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 body 	 	else	who	 do 	 es 	 	 poll 	 s 	 	.
if	gallup	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	a	poll	on	the	same	day	that	nbc	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	a	poll	,	people	will	pay	attention	to	the	gallup	poll	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	understand	that	.
so	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	change	the	world	.	so	here	is	the	question	 some 	 one 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
``	how	could	we	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 poll 	 ing 	 	what	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	 think 	 s 	 	or	what	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 think 	 s 	 	,	or	who	 think 	 s 	 	what	about	obama	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	mccain	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	the	entire	world	think	?	``
and	they	found	a	way	to	do	the	first	-	ever	world	poll	.
they	had	people	 involve 	 d 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 no 	 bel 	 	 laureate 	 s 	 	in	 economic 	 s 	 	,	who	 report 	 ed 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	they	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	 sheet 	 s 	 	of	paper	and	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	,	``	how	do	we	survey	the	population	of	sub	-	saharan	africa	?
how	do	we	survey	 population 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	have	access	to	technology	,	and	speak	 language 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	speak	,	and	we	do	n't	know	 any 	 one 	 	who	 speak 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 language 	 s 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	in	order	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	great	mission	,	we	have	to	be	able	to	do	it	.
 incident 	 ally 	 	,	they	did	pull	it	off	.
and	they	released	the	first	-	ever	world	poll	.
so	i	'd	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	these	 thought 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	:	we	all	form	 tribe 	 s 	 	,	all	of	us	.
you	're	in	 tribe 	 s 	 	here	.	 hope 	 fully 	 	you	're	 extend 	 ing 	 	the	reach	of	the	 tribe 	 s 	 	that	you	have	.
but	the	question	on	the	table	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	what	kind	of	an	impact	are	the	 tribe 	 s 	 	that	you	are	in	making	?
you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	one	 present 	 ation 	 	after	 an 	 other 	 	,	often	 represent 	 ing 	 	a	group	of	people	,	a	tribe	,	about	how	they	have	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	.
if	you	do	what	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	you	listen	for	how	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	communicate	in	the	 tribe 	 s 	 	that	you	're	in	.
and	you	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	them	where	they	are	.	you	nudge	them	forward	.
you	remember	to	talk	all	five	culture	 stage 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	got	people	in	all	five	,	around	us	.
and	the	question	that	i	'd	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	will	your	 tribe 	 s 	 	change	the	world	?
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
