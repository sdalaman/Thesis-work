 th 	 is 	 	is	a	guy	named	bob	mckim	.
he	was	a	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 research 	 er 	 	in	the	'60s	and	'70s	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	led	the	stanford	design	program	.
and	in	fact	,	my	friend	and	ideo	founder	,	david	kelley	,	who	's	out	there	 some 	 where 	 	,	 stud 	 ied 	 	under	him	at	stanford	.
and	he	 like 	 d 	 	to	do	an	 exercis 	 e 	 	with	his	 student 	 s 	 	where	he	got	them	to	take	a	piece	of	paper	and	draw	the	person	who	 s 	 at 	 	next	to	them	,	 the 	 ir 	 	neighbor	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	could	.
and	in	fact	,	we	're	going	to	do	that	 exercis 	 e 	 	right	now	.
you	all	have	a	piece	of	 card 	 board 	 	and	a	piece	of	paper	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	a	bunch	of	 circle 	 s 	 	on	it	.
i	need	you	to	turn	that	piece	of	paper	over	;	you	should	find	that	it	's	blank	on	the	other	side	.
and	there	should	be	a	pencil	.
and	i	want	you	to	pick	 some 	 body 	 	that	's	 seat 	 ed 	 	next	to	you	,	and	when	i	say	,	go	,	you	've	got	30	 second 	 s 	 	to	draw	your	neighbor	,	ok	?
so	,	 every 	 body 	 	ready	?	ok	.	off	you	go	.
you	've	got	30	 second 	 s 	 	,	you	'd	better	be	fast	.
come	on	:	 t 	 hose 	 	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	...
ok	?	stop	.	all	right	,	now	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	lot	's	of	laughter	.	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	laughter	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	of	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	.
am	i	 hear 	 ing 	 	a	few	``	sorry	's	``	?	i	think	i	'm	 hear 	 ing 	 	a	few	sorry	's	.
 y 	 up 	 	,	 y 	 up 	 	,	i	think	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	am	.
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	every	time	,	every	time	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	 adult 	 s 	 	.
mckim	found	 th 	 is 	 	every	time	he	did	it	with	his	 student 	 s 	 	.
he	got	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 respons 	 e 	 	:	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	sorry	's	.
and	he	would	point	 th 	 is 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	evidence	that	we	fear	the	judgment	of	our	 peer 	 s 	 	,	and	that	we	're	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	about	 show 	 ing 	 	our	 idea 	 s 	 	to	people	we	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	our	 peer 	 s 	 	,	to	 t 	 hose 	 	around	us	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	fear	is	what	 cause 	 s 	 	us	to	be	 conserv 	 ative 	 	in	our	 think 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	might	have	a	wild	idea	,	but	we	're	 af 	 raid 	 	to	share	it	with	 any 	 body 	 	else	.
ok	,	so	if	you	try	the	same	 exercis 	 e 	 	with	 kid 	 s 	 	,	they	have	no	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	at	all	.
they	just	 quit 	 e 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	show	 the 	 ir 	 	 master 	 piece 	 	to	 who 	 ever 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	look	at	it	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	they	learn	to	 be 	 come 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	much	more	sensitive	to	the	 opinion 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	they	lose	that	 free 	 dom 	 	and	they	do	start	to	 be 	 come 	 	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	.
and	in	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 kid 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	time	after	time	that	 kid 	 s 	 	who	feel	secure	,	who	are	in	a	kind	of	 trust 	 ed 	 	environment	--	they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	feel	most	free	to	play	.
and	if	you	're	 start 	 ing 	 	a	design	firm	,	let	's	say	,	then	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	create	a	place	where	people	have	the	same	kind	of	security	.
where	they	have	the	same	kind	of	security	to	take	 risk 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	have	the	same	kind	of	security	to	play	.
before	 found 	 ing 	 	ideo	,	david	 s 	 aid 	 	that	what	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	to	form	a	company	where	all	the	 employ 	 ees 	 	are	my	best	 friend 	 s 	 	.
now	,	that	was	n't	just	self	-	 indulge 	 nce 	 	.
he	 k 	 new 	 	that	 friend 	 ship 	 	is	a	short	cut	to	play	.
and	he	 k 	 new 	 	that	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	sense	of	trust	,	and	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	then	to	take	the	kind	of	creative	 risk 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	take	 a 	 s 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	.
and	so	,	that	decision	to	work	with	his	 friend 	 s 	 	--	now	he	 ha 	 s 	 	550	of	them	--	was	what	got	ideo	 start 	 ed 	 	.
and	our	 studio 	 s 	 	,	like	,	i	think	,	 man 	 y 	 	creative	 work 	 place 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	are	designed	to	help	people	feel	 relax 	 ed 	 	:	familiar	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	the	people	that	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	more	than	decor	,	but	i	think	we	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	that	creative	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	do	often	have	 symbol 	 s 	 	in	the	 work 	 place 	 	that	 re 	 mind 	 	people	to	be	 play 	 ful 	 	,	and	that	it	's	a	 per 	 mis 	 s 	 ive 	 	environment	.
so	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 micro 	 bus 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	room	that	we	have	in	one	our	 building 	 s 	 	at	ideo	;	or	at	pixar	,	where	the	 anim 	 ators 	 	work	in	 wood 	 en 	 	 hut 	 s 	 	and	 decor 	 ated 	 	 cave 	 s 	 	;	or	at	the	googleplex	,	where	it	's	famous	for	 it 	 s 	 	[	beach	]	 vol 	 ley 	 ball 	 	 court 	 s 	 	,	and	even	 th 	 is 	 	massive	dinosaur	skeleton	with	pink	 flaming 	 os 	 	on	it	.
do	n't	know	the	reason	for	the	pink	 flaming 	 os 	 	,	but	 any 	 way 	 	,	they	're	there	in	the	garden	.
or	even	in	the	swiss	 off 	 ice 	 	of	google	,	which	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	most	 wack 	 y 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	all	.
and	my	 theor 	 y 	 	is	,	that	's	so	the	swiss	can	prove	to	 the 	 ir 	 	californian	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	that	they	're	not	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
so	they	have	the	slide	,	and	they	even	have	a	 fire 	 man 	 	's	pole	.
do	n't	know	what	they	do	with	that	,	but	they	have	one	.
so	all	of	these	 place 	 s 	 	have	these	 symbol 	 s 	 	.
now	,	our	big	symbol	at	ideo	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	so	much	the	place	,	it	's	a	thing	.
and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	or	 create 	 d 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	's	a	 to 	 y 	 	;	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	finger	 blast 	 er 	 	.	``
and	i	 for 	 got 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	one	up	with	me	.
so	if	 some 	 body 	 	can	reach	under	the	chair	that	's	next	to	them	,	you	'll	find	 some 	 thing 	 	taped	 under 	 neath 	 	it	.
that	's	great	.	if	you	could	pass	it	up	.	 thank 	 s 	 	,	david	,	i	appreciate	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	finger	 blast 	 er 	 	,	and	you	will	find	that	every	one	of	you	 ha 	 s 	 	got	one	taped	under	your	chair	.
and	i	'm	going	to	run	a	little	experiment	.	 an 	 other 	 	little	experiment	.
but	before	we	start	,	i	need	just	to	put	these	on	.
thank	you	.	all	right	.
now	,	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	,	i	'm	going	to	see	how	--	i	ca	n't	see	out	of	these	,	ok	.
i	'm	going	to	see	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	at	the	back	of	the	room	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	onto	the	stage	.
so	the	way	they	work	is	,	you	know	,	you	just	put	your	finger	in	the	thing	,	pull	them	back	,	and	off	you	go	.
so	,	do	n't	look	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.	that	's	my	 on 	 ly 	 	 recommend 	 ation 	 	here	.
i	want	to	see	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	can	get	these	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	stage	.
so	come	on	!	there	we	go	,	there	we	go	.	thank	you	.	thank	you	.	oh	.
i	have	 an 	 other 	 	idea	.	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	--	there	we	go	.
there	we	go	.
thank	you	,	thank	you	,	thank	you	.
not	bad	,	not	bad	.	no	serious	 inju 	 ries 	 	so	far	.
well	,	they	're	still	coming	in	from	the	back	there	;	they	're	still	coming	in	.
some	of	you	have	n't	 fire 	 d 	 	them	yet	.
can	you	not	figure	out	how	to	do	it	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	?
it	's	not	that	hard	.	most	of	your	 kid 	 s 	 	figure	out	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	first	10	 second 	 s 	 	,	when	they	pick	it	up	.
all	right	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	all	right	.	let	's	--	i	suppose	we	'd	better	...
i	'd	better	clear	these	up	out	of	the	way	;	 other 	 wise 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	trip	over	them	.
all	right	.	so	the	rest	of	you	can	 s 	 ave 	 	them	for	when	i	say	 some 	 thing 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	you	can	fire	at	me	.
all	right	.	i	think	i	'm	going	to	take	these	off	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	ca	n't	see	a	damn	thing	when	i	've	--	all	right	,	ok	.
so	,	ah	,	that	was	 f 	 un 	 	.
all	right	,	good	.
so	,	ok	,	so	why	?
so	we	have	the	finger	 blast 	 ers 	 	.	other	people	have	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	you	know	.
why	do	we	have	them	?	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	have	them	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	 may 	 be 	 	 play 	 fulness 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	why	is	it	 import 	 ant 	 	?
we	use	it	in	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 pragmat 	 ic 	 	way	,	to	be	honest	.
we	think	 play 	 fulness 	 	 help 	 s 	 	us	get	to	better	creative	 solution 	 s 	 	.
 help 	 s 	 	us	do	our	 job 	 s 	 	better	,	and	 help 	 s 	 	us	feel	better	when	we	do	them	.
now	,	an	adult	 en 	 counter 	 ing 	 	a	new	 situ 	 ation 	 	--	when	we	 en 	 counter 	 	a	new	 situ 	 ation 	 	we	have	a	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	want	to	 categor 	 ize 	 	it	just	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	,	you	know	.
and	there	's	a	reason	for	that	:	we	want	to	settle	on	an	answer	.
life	's	 complic 	 ated 	 	;	we	want	to	figure	out	what	's	going	on	around	us	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
i	suspect	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	[	for	]	why	we	want	to	 categor 	 ize 	 	new	 thing 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
one	of	them	might	be	,	you	know	,	when	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	funny	 strip 	 y 	 	thing	:	is	that	a	tiger	just	about	to	jump	out	and	kill	us	?
or	is	it	just	some	weird	 shadow 	 s 	 	on	the	tree	?
we	need	to	figure	that	out	 pre 	 tty 	 	fast	.
well	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	we	did	once	.
most	of	us	do	n't	need	to	 any 	 more 	 	,	i	suppose	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	foil	,	right	?	you	use	it	in	the	kitchen	.
that	's	what	it	is	,	is	n't	it	?	of	course	it	is	,	of	course	it	is	.
well	,	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	.
 kid 	 s 	 	are	more	 engag 	 ed 	 	with	open	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
now	,	they	'll	 certain 	 ly 	 	--	when	they	come	 a 	 cross 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	new	,	they	'll	 certain 	 ly 	 	ask	,	``	what	is	it	?	``
of	course	they	will	.	but	they	'll	 al 	 so 	 	ask	,	``	what	can	i	do	with	it	?	``
and	you	know	,	the	more	creative	of	them	might	get	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 open 	 ness 	 	is	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 expl 	 or 	 atory 	 	play	.
any	 parent 	 s 	 	of	young	 kid 	 s 	 	in	the	audience	?	there	must	be	some	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	thought	so	.	so	we	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	it	,	have	n't	we	?
we	've	all	told	 st 	 ories 	 	about	how	,	on	christmas	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	our	 kid 	 s 	 	end	up	 play 	 ing 	 	with	the	boxes	far	more	than	they	play	with	the	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	that	are	 in 	 side 	 	them	.
and	you	know	,	from	an	exploration	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	 make 	 s 	 	complete	sense	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	do	a	lot	more	with	boxes	than	you	can	do	with	a	 to 	 y 	 	.
even	one	like	,	say	,	tickle	me	elmo	--	which	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	one	thing	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	boxes	 off 	 er 	 	an	infinite	number	of	 choice 	 s 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 play 	 ful 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	get	 old 	 er 	 	,	we	tend	to	forget	and	we	have	to	 re 	 learn 	 	.
so	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	bob	mckim	's	 favor 	 ite 	 	 exercis 	 es 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	30	 circle 	 s 	 	test	.	``
so	we	're	back	to	work	.	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	going	to	get	back	to	work	 aga 	 in 	 	.
turn	that	piece	of	paper	that	you	did	the	sketch	on	back	over	,	and	you	'll	find	 t 	 hose 	 	30	 circle 	 s 	 	 print 	 ed 	 	on	the	piece	of	paper	.
so	it	should	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	you	should	be	looking	at	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	,	i	'm	going	to	give	you	minute	,	and	i	want	you	to	adapt	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	 in 	 to 	 	 object 	 s 	 	of	some	form	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	could	turn	one	 in 	 to 	 	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	,	or	 an 	 other 	 	one	 in 	 to 	 	a	 s 	 un 	 	.	all	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	 quant 	 ity 	 	.
i	want	you	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	,	in	the	minute	that	i	'm	just	about	to	give	you	.
so	,	 every 	 body 	 	ready	?	ok	?	off	you	go	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	put	down	your	 pencil 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	say	.
so	,	who	got	more	than	five	 circle 	 s 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	?
 hope 	 fully 	 	 every 	 body 	 	?	more	than	10	?
keep	your	 hand 	 s 	 	up	if	you	did	10	.
15	?	20	?	 any 	 body 	 	get	all	30	?
no	?	oh	!	 some 	 body 	 	did	.	fantastic	.
did	 any 	 body 	 	to	a	 vari 	 ation 	 	on	a	theme	?	like	a	smiley	face	?
happy	face	?	 s 	 ad 	 	face	?	 sleep 	 y 	 	face	?	 any 	 body 	 	do	that	?
 any 	 body 	 	use	my	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	?	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	the	 foot 	 ball 	 	?
great	.	cool	.	so	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 quant 	 ity 	 	.
i	was	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	different	.
i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	you	to	fill	in	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	tend	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	we	edit	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	stop	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	self	-	edit	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	our	 desir 	 e 	 	to	be	original	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	form	of	 edit 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 play 	 ful 	 	.
so	that	ability	just	to	go	for	it	and	explore	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	even	if	they	do	n't	seem	that	different	from	each	other	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 kid 	 s 	 	do	well	,	and	it	is	a	form	of	play	.
so	now	,	bob	mckim	did	 an 	 other 	 	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	test	in	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	famous	experiment	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	1960s	.
 any 	 body 	 	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	?	it	's	the	peyote	 c 	 actu 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	plant	from	which	you	can	create	 me 	 scal 	 ine 	 	,	one	of	the	 psych 	 e 	 delic 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	around	in	the	'60s	,	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	it	well	.
mckim	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	paper	in	1966	,	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	an	experiment	that	he	and	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	to	test	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 psych 	 e 	 delic 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	on	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
so	he	 pick 	 ed 	 	27	 professional 	 s 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	,	 architect 	 s 	 	,	furniture	 design 	 ers 	 	even	,	 artist 	 s 	 	--	and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	come	 a 	 long 	 	one	 even 	 ing 	 	,	and	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	problem	with	them	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.
he	 g 	 ave 	 	each	of	them	some	 me 	 scal 	 ine 	 	,	and	had	them	listen	to	some	nice	,	 relax 	 ing 	 	music	for	a	while	.
and	then	he	did	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	purdue	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	test	.
you	might	know	it	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	how	 man 	 y 	 	uses	can	you	find	for	a	paper	clip	?	``
it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	the	30	 circle 	 s 	 	thing	that	i	just	had	you	do	.
now	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	he	 g 	 ave 	 	the	test	before	the	 drug 	 s 	 	and	after	the	 drug 	 s 	 	,	to	see	what	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	was	in	people	's	 facil 	 ity 	 	and	speed	with	coming	up	with	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	then	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	go	away	and	work	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	they	'd	 br 	 ought 	 	.
and	they	'd	come	up	with	a	bunch	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	--	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	valid	 solution 	 s 	 	--	to	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.
and	so	,	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	,	some	of	these	 individual 	 s 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	;	in	one	case	,	a	new	commercial	building	and	 design 	 s 	 	for	 house 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	by	 client 	 s 	 	;	a	design	of	a	solar	space	 prob 	 e 	 	experiment	;	a	 re 	 design 	 	of	the	linear	electron	 accele 	 rator 	 	;	an	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	to	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	tape	 record 	 er 	 	--	you	can	tell	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	while	ago	;	the	 comple 	 tion 	 	of	a	line	of	furniture	;	and	even	a	new	conceptual	model	of	the	 photo 	 n 	 	.
so	it	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 even 	 ing 	 	.
in	fact	,	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	was	the	reason	that	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	got	off	to	 it 	 s 	 	great	start	with	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
we	do	n't	know	,	but	it	may	be	.
we	need	to	ask	some	of	the	ceos	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 scal 	 ine 	 	experiment	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	,	it	was	n't	the	 drug 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	;	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	what	the	 drug 	 s 	 	did	would	help	shock	people	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	normal	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	,	and	 get 	 ting 	 	them	to	forget	the	adult	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	in	the	way	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	hard	to	break	our	 habit 	 s 	 	,	our	adult	 habit 	 s 	 	.
at	ideo	we	have	 brain 	 storm 	 ing 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	written	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
edicts	like	,	``	 def 	 er 	 	judgment	,	``	or	``	go	for	 quant 	 ity 	 	.	``
and	 some 	 how 	 	that	 seem 	 s 	 	wrong	.
i	mean	,	can	you	have	 rule 	 s 	 	about	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	?
well	,	it	sort	of	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	we	need	 rule 	 s 	 	to	help	us	break	the	old	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 norm 	 s 	 	that	 other 	 wise 	 	we	might	 br 	 ing 	 	to	the	creative	process	.
and	we	've	 certain 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 t 	 	that	over	time	,	you	get	much	better	 brain 	 storm 	 ing 	 	,	much	more	creative	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	when	 every 	 body 	 	 do 	 es 	 	play	by	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
now	,	of	course	,	 man 	 y 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	individual	 design 	 ers 	 	,	 achiev 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	much	more	 organ 	 ic 	 	way	.
i	think	the	eameses	are	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 ation 	 	.
and	they	 experiment 	 ed 	 	with	 ply 	 wood 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	one	single	goal	in	mind	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	what	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	them	.
they	went	from	 design 	 ing 	 	 splint 	 s 	 	for	 wound 	 ed 	 	 soldier 	 s 	 	coming	out	of	world	war	ii	and	the	korean	war	,	i	think	,	and	from	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	they	 move 	 d 	 	on	to	 chair 	 s 	 	.
through	constant	 experiment 	 ation 	 	with	 material 	 s 	 	,	they	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	wide	range	of	 icon 	 ic 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	that	we	know	 to 	 day 	 	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 result 	 ing 	 	in	,	of	course	,	the	 legend 	 ary 	 	 loung 	 e 	 	chair	.
now	,	if	the	eameses	had	 stop 	 ped 	 	with	that	first	great	solution	,	then	we	would	n't	be	the	 benefici 	 aries 	 	of	so	 man 	 y 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 design 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	of	course	,	they	used	 experiment 	 ation 	 	in	all	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	work	,	from	 film 	 s 	 	to	 building 	 s 	 	,	from	 game 	 s 	 	to	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
so	,	they	're	great	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	of	exploration	and	 experiment 	 ation 	 	in	design	.
now	,	while	the	eameses	 we 	 re 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	physical	 object 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	through	building	 prototype 	 s 	 	.
and	building	is	the	next	of	the	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	i	thought	i	'd	talk	about	.
so	the	average	western	first	-	 grad 	 er 	 	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	50	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	play	time	taking	part	in	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	construction	play	.	``
construction	play	--	it	's	 play 	 ful 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	way	to	learn	.
when	play	is	about	building	a	tower	out	of	 block 	 s 	 	,	the	kid	 begin 	 s 	 	to	learn	a	lot	about	 tower 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	they	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	knock	it	down	and	start	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	by	-	product	of	play	.
it	's	 class 	 ically 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	david	kelley	 call 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	,	when	it	's	carried	out	by	 design 	 ers 	 	,	``	 think 	 ing 	 	with	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.	``
and	it	 typical 	 ly 	 	 involve 	 s 	 	making	 multi 	 ple 	 	,	low	-	 re 	 solution 	 	 prototype 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	often	by	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	found	 element 	 s 	 	together	in	order	to	get	to	a	solution	.
on	one	of	his	 ear 	 liest 	 	 project 	 s 	 	,	the	team	was	kind	of	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	and	they	came	up	with	a	 mechan 	 ism 	 	by	 hack 	 ing 	 	together	a	prototype	made	from	a	roll	-	on	 deodo 	 rant 	 	.
now	,	that	 be 	 came 	 	the	first	commercial	computer	mouse	for	the	apple	lisa	and	the	macintosh	.
so	,	they	 learn 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	way	to	that	by	building	 prototype 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	a	group	of	 design 	 ers 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	 sur 	 gical 	 	instrument	with	some	 surgeon 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	them	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	 surgeon 	 s 	 	about	what	it	was	they	 need 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 design 	 ers 	 	ran	out	of	the	room	and	 grab 	 bed 	 	a	white	board	marker	and	a	film	 can 	 ist 	 er 	 	--	which	is	now	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	precious	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	medium	--	and	a	 clothe 	 spin 	 	.	he	taped	them	all	together	,	ran	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	mean	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	the	 surgeon 	 s 	 	 grab 	 bed 	 	hold	of	it	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	i	want	to	hold	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	like	that	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	a	productive	conversation	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	about	design	around	a	tangible	object	.
and	in	the	end	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	real	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	is	all	about	 quick 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	real	world	,	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	your	 think 	 ing 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	.
at	ideo	there	's	a	kind	of	a	back	-	to	-	 pre 	 school 	 	feel	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	about	the	environment	.
the	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	 cart 	 s 	 	,	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 color 	 ed 	 	paper	and	play	-	doh	and	glue	 stick 	 s 	 	and	stuff	--	i	mean	,	they	do	have	a	bit	of	a	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	feel	to	them	.
but	the	 import 	 ant 	 	idea	is	that	 every 	 thing 	 	's	at	hand	,	 every 	 thing 	 	's	around	.
so	when	 design 	 ers 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 idea 	 s 	 	,	they	can	start	building	stuff	 when 	 ever 	 	they	want	.
they	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	even	have	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	some	kind	of	 form 	 al 	 	 work 	 shop 	 	to	do	it	.
and	we	think	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	then	the	 s 	 ad 	 	thing	is	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 pre 	 school 	 s 	 	are	full	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	,	 a 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	go	through	the	school	system	it	all	 get 	 s 	 	taken	away	.
they	lose	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	that	 facilitate 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 play 	 ful 	 	and	building	mode	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	of	course	,	by	the	time	you	get	to	the	average	 work 	 place 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	best	construction	tool	we	have	might	be	the	post	-	it	 note 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 bar 	 ren 	 	.
but	by	giving	project	 team 	 s 	 	and	the	 client 	 s 	 	who	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 per 	 mission 	 	to	think	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	complex	 idea 	 s 	 	can	spring	 in 	 to 	 	life	and	go	right	through	to	 exec 	 ution 	 	much	more	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	nurse	using	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	--	 plastic 	 ine 	 	prototype	,	 explain 	 ing 	 	what	she	 want 	 s 	 	out	of	a	 port 	 able 	 	information	system	to	a	team	of	 techno 	 logists 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	that	are	 work 	 ing 	 	with	her	in	a	hospital	.
and	just	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	prototype	 allow 	 s 	 	her	to	talk	about	what	she	 want 	 s 	 	in	a	much	more	 power 	 ful 	 	way	.
and	of	course	,	by	building	quick	 prototype 	 s 	 	,	we	can	get	out	and	test	our	 idea 	 s 	 	with	 consumer 	 s 	 	and	 user 	 s 	 	much	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	than	if	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	them	through	 word 	 s 	 	.
but	what	about	 design 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	n't	physical	?
 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	service	or	an	experience	?
 some 	 thing 	 	that	 exist 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 interact 	 ions 	 	over	time	?
 in 	 stead 	 	of	building	play	,	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 approach 	 ed 	 	with	role	-	play	.
so	,	if	you	're	 design 	 ing 	 	an	 interact 	 ion 	 	between	two	people	--	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	--	 order 	 ing 	 	food	at	a	fast	food	joint	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	need	to	be	able	to	imagine	how	that	experience	might	feel	over	a	period	of	time	.
and	i	think	the	best	way	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	,	and	get	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	for	any	 flaw 	 s 	 	in	your	design	,	is	to	act	it	out	.
so	we	do	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	work	at	ideo	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	our	 client 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	can	be	a	little	 skeptic 	 al 	 	;	i	'll	come	back	to	that	.
but	a	place	,	i	think	,	where	the	effort	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 worth 	 while 	 	is	where	people	are	 wrestl 	 ing 	 	with	 quit 	 e 	 	serious	 problem 	 s 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	education	or	security	or	finance	or	health	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	in	a	 health 	 care 	 	environment	of	some	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	some	 nurse 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	out	a	service	scenario	around	patient	care	.
but	you	know	,	 man 	 y 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	engage	with	role	-	play	.
some	of	it	's	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	and	some	of	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	they	just	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	what	 emerge 	 s 	 	is	 necess 	 arily 	 	valid	.
they	dismiss	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	``	that	's	just	 happen 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 act 	 ing 	 	it	out	.	``
research	 in 	 to 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	'	behavior	 actual 	 ly 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	it	's	worth	taking	role	-	 play 	 ing 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	children	play	a	role	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	follow	social	 script 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	that	they	've	 learn 	 t 	 	from	us	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
if	one	kid	 play 	 s 	 	``	store	,	``	and	 an 	 other 	 	one	's	 play 	 ing 	 	``	house	,	``	then	the	whole	kind	of	play	 fall 	 s 	 	down	.
so	they	get	used	to	 quit 	 e 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	for	social	 interact 	 ions 	 	,	and	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	quick	to	point	out	when	they	're	broken	.
so	when	,	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	we	role	-	play	,	then	we	have	a	huge	set	of	these	 script 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 internal 	 ized 	 	.
we	've	gone	through	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 experience 	 s 	 	in	life	,	and	they	provide	a	strong	 intuit 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	an	 interact 	 ion 	 	is	going	to	work	.
so	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	good	,	when	 act 	 ing 	 	out	a	solution	,	at	 spot 	 ting 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 lack 	 s 	 	 authentic 	 ity 	 	.
so	role	-	play	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 experience 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	way	for	us	,	 a 	 s 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	,	to	explore	role	-	play	is	to	put	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	through	an	experience	which	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	for	,	and	project	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	experience	.
so	here	are	some	 design 	 ers 	 	who	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	what	it	might	feel	like	to	sleep	in	a	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	space	on	an	 air 	 plane 	 	.
and	so	they	 grab 	 bed 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 material 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	,	and	did	 th 	 is 	 	role	-	play	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	role	-	play	,	just	to	get	a	sense	of	what	it	would	be	like	for	 passenger 	 s 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	 quit 	 e 	 	small	 place 	 s 	 	on	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	our	 design 	 ers 	 	,	kristian	simsarian	,	and	he	's	 put 	 ting 	 	 him 	 self 	 	through	the	experience	of	 be 	 ing 	 	an	er	patient	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	hospital	,	in	a	real	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	.
one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	he	chose	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	large	video	camera	with	him	was	 be 	 cause 	 	he	did	n't	want	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	he	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	sick	,	and	 stick 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	him	that	he	was	going	to	regret	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	 any 	 how 	 	,	he	went	there	with	his	video	camera	,	and	it	's	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	see	what	he	 br 	 ought 	 	back	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	video	when	he	got	back	,	we	saw	20	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	video	--	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	it	you	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	project	 your 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	experience	.
and	you	know	what	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	:	all	of	that	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	while	you	're	left	out	in	the	 hall 	 way 	 	while	the	 doc 	 s 	 	are	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	some	more	 urge 	 nt 	 	case	in	one	of	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	rooms	,	 wonder 	 ing 	 	what	the	heck	's	going	on	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	using	role	-	play	--	or	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	living	through	the	experience	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	creating	 empath 	 y 	 	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	when	you	use	video	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
or	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	our	 design 	 ers 	 	,	altay	sendil	:	he	's	here	 hav 	 ing 	 	his	chest	 wax 	 ed 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 va 	 in 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	he	is	--	no	,	i	'm	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	--	but	in	order	to	 empath 	 ize 	 	with	the	pain	that	chronic	care	 patient 	 s 	 	go	through	when	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	 dress 	 ing 	 s 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	.
and	so	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	these	 analog 	 ous 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	,	 analog 	 ous 	 	role	-	play	,	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	.
so	when	a	kid	 dress 	 es 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	 fire 	 fight 	 er 	 	,	you	know	,	he	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	try	on	that	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
he	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	what	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	to	be	a	 fire 	 fight 	 er 	 	.
we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	on	these	 experience 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	idea	of	role	-	play	is	both	 a 	 s 	 	an	 empath 	 y 	 	tool	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	a	tool	for	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
and	you	know	,	we	kind	of	admire	people	who	do	 th 	 is 	 	at	ideo	 any 	 way 	 	.
not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	they	lead	to	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	about	the	experience	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	explore	and	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	 un 	 self 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	surrender	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	the	experience	.
in	short	,	we	admire	 the 	 ir 	 	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	play	.
 play 	 ful 	 	exploration	,	 play 	 ful 	 	building	and	role	-	play	:	 t 	 hose 	 	are	some	of	the	ways	that	 design 	 ers 	 	use	play	in	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
and	so	far	,	i	admit	,	 th 	 is 	 	might	feel	like	it	's	a	 mess 	 age 	 	just	to	go	out	and	play	like	a	kid	.
and	to	certain	 ex 	 tent 	 	it	is	,	but	i	want	to	stress	a	couple	of	 point 	 s 	 	.
the	first	thing	to	remember	is	that	play	is	not	 anarch 	 y 	 	.
play	 ha 	 s 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	it	's	group	play	.
when	 kid 	 s 	 	play	tea	party	,	or	they	play	 cop 	 s 	 	and	 robber 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 follow 	 ing 	 	a	script	that	they	've	 agree 	 d 	 	to	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	code	 negoti 	 ation 	 	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	productive	play	.
so	,	remember	the	 sketch 	 ing 	 	task	we	did	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	?
the	kind	of	little	face	,	the	portrait	you	did	?
well	,	imagine	if	you	did	the	same	task	with	 friend 	 s 	 	while	you	 we 	 re 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	in	a	pub	.
but	 every 	 body 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	to	play	a	game	where	the	worst	sketch	artist	 b 	 ought 	 	the	next	round	of	 drink 	 s 	 	.
that	 frame 	 work 	 	of	 rule 	 s 	 	would	have	 turn 	 ed 	 	an	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	,	difficult	 situ 	 ation 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 f 	 un 	 	game	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	we	'd	all	feel	 perfect 	 ly 	 	secure	and	have	a	good	time	--	but	 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	 under 	 stood 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	and	we	 agree 	 d 	 	on	them	together	.
but	there	are	n't	just	 rule 	 s 	 	about	how	to	play	;	there	are	 rule 	 s 	 	about	when	to	play	.
 kid 	 s 	 	do	n't	play	all	the	time	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
they	 transit 	 ion 	 	in	and	out	of	it	,	and	good	 teacher 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	to	move	 kid 	 s 	 	through	these	 experience 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	,	we	need	to	be	able	to	 transit 	 ion 	 	in	and	out	of	play	 al 	 so 	 	.
and	if	we	're	running	design	 studio 	 s 	 	we	need	to	be	able	to	figure	out	,	how	can	we	 transit 	 ion 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	through	these	different	 experience 	 s 	 	?
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	true	if	we	think	about	the	sort	of	--	i	think	what	's	 ver 	 y 	 	different	about	design	is	that	we	go	through	these	two	 ver 	 y 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 mode 	 s 	 	of	operation	.
we	go	through	a	sort	of	generative	mode	,	where	we	're	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	;	and	then	we	come	back	together	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	come	back	looking	for	that	solution	,	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	that	solution	.
i	think	they	're	two	 quit 	 e 	 	different	 mode 	 s 	 	:	 diverge 	 nce 	 	and	 converg 	 ence 	 	.
and	i	think	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	in	the	 diverge 	 nt 	 	mode	that	we	most	need	 play 	 fulness 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	in	 converg 	 ent 	 	mode	we	need	to	be	more	serious	.
and	so	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	move	between	 t 	 hose 	 	 mode 	 s 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	so	,	it	's	where	there	's	a	more	 nuance 	 d 	 	version	view	of	play	,	i	think	,	is	 requir 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	fall	 in 	 to 	 	the	trap	that	these	 state 	 s 	 	are	absolute	.
you	're	either	 play 	 ful 	 	or	you	're	serious	,	and	you	ca	n't	be	both	.
but	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	true	:	you	can	be	a	serious	professional	adult	and	,	at	 time 	 s 	 	,	be	 play 	 ful 	 	.
it	's	not	an	either	/	or	;	it	's	an	``	and	.	``
you	can	be	serious	and	play	.
so	to	sum	it	up	,	we	need	trust	to	play	,	and	we	need	trust	to	be	creative	.	so	,	there	's	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
and	there	are	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 learn 	 t 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	that	turn	out	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	to	us	 a 	 s 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	.
they	include	exploration	,	which	is	about	going	for	 quant 	 ity 	 	;	building	,	and	 think 	 ing 	 	with	your	 hand 	 s 	 	;	and	role	-	play	,	where	 act 	 ing 	 	it	out	 help 	 s 	 	us	both	to	have	more	 empath 	 y 	 	for	the	 situ 	 ations 	 	in	which	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	,	and	to	create	 service 	 s 	 	and	 experience 	 s 	 	that	are	 seam 	 less 	 	and	authentic	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
