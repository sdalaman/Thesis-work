let	me	show	you	some	 image 	 s 	 	of	what	i	consider	to	be	the	cities	of	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
so	,	that	's	kibera	,	the	largest	 squat 	 ter 	 	community	in	nairobi	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 squat 	 ter 	 	community	in	sanjay	gandhi	national	park	in	bombay	,	india	,	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	mumbai	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	hosinia	,	the	largest	and	most	 urban 	 ized 	 	favela	in	rio	de	janeiro	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	sultanbelyi	,	which	is	one	of	the	largest	 squat 	 ter 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	istanbul	.
they	are	what	i	consider	to	be	the	cities	of	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	the	new	urban	world	.
now	,	why	do	i	say	that	?
to	tell	you	about	that	i	have	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	fellow	here	,	his	name	is	julius	.
and	i	met	julius	the	last	week	that	i	was	living	in	kibera	.
so	,	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	there	 al 	 most 	 	three	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	 tour 	 ing 	 	around	the	city	going	to	different	 squat 	 ter 	 	 area 	 s 	 	and	julius	was	 tag 	 ging 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	he	was	bug	eyed	and	at	certain	 point 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	,	he	 grab 	 bed 	 	my	hand	for	support	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	most	kenyans	would	never	consider	 do 	 ing 	 	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	polite	and	they	do	n't	get	so	forward	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	found	out	 lat 	 er 	 	that	it	was	julius	'	first	day	in	nairobi	,	and	he	's	one	of	 man 	 y 	 	.
so	,	close	to	200,000	people	a	day	 migr 	 ate 	 	from	the	 r 	 ural 	 	to	the	urban	 area 	 s 	 	.
that	's	,	and	i	'm	going	to	be	fair	to	the	 statistic 	 ians 	 	who	 talk 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	not	 al 	 most 	 	1.5	million	people	a	week	,	but	 al 	 most 	 	1.4	million	people	a	week	but	i	'm	a	journalist	,	and	we	 exagge 	 rate 	 	,	so	 al 	 most 	 	1.5	million	people	a	week	,	close	to	70	million	people	a	year	.
and	if	you	do	the	math	,	that	's	130	people	every	minute	.
so	,	that	'll	be	--	in	the	18	 minute 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 give 	 n 	 	to	talk	here	,	between	two	and	three	thousand	people	will	have	 journey 	 ed 	 	to	the	cities	.
and	here	are	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	--	a	billion	 squat 	 ter 	 s 	 	,	one	in	six	people	on	the	planet	.
2030	--	two	billion	 squat 	 ter 	 s 	 	,	one	in	four	people	on	the	planet	.
and	the	estimate	is	that	in	2050	,	there	'll	be	three	billion	 squat 	 ter 	 s 	 	,	better	than	one	in	three	people	on	earth	.
so	,	these	are	the	cities	of	the	future	,	and	we	have	to	engage	them	.
and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	of	the	good	life	,	and	before	i	show	you	the	rest	of	my	 present 	 ation 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	 viol 	 ate 	 	ted	 rule 	 s 	 	here	,	and	i	'm	going	to	read	you	 some 	 thing 	 	from	my	book	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	.

he	's	got	a	 f 	 ence 	 	;	he	 scavenge 	 d 	 	a	door	;	he	's	got	new	tile	on	the	roof	.
and	then	you	get	rocinha	and	you	can	see	that	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	even	better	.
the	 building 	 s 	 	here	are	multi	-	story	.
they	develop	--	you	can	see	on	the	far	right	one	where	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	just	stack	on	top	of	each	other	,	room	,	after	room	,	after	room	.
and	what	people	do	is	they	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	home	on	one	or	two	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	they	sell	 the 	 ir 	 	 log 	 gi 	 a 	 	or	roof	 right 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 one 	 	else	 build 	 s 	 	on	top	of	 the 	 ir 	 	building	,	and	then	that	person	 sell 	 s 	 	the	roof	 right 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 one 	 	else	 build 	 s 	 	on	top	of	 the 	 ir 	 	building	.
all	of	these	 building 	 s 	 	are	made	out	of	 reinforce 	 d 	 	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	and	brick	.
and	then	you	get	sultanbelyi	,	in	 tur 	 key 	 	,	where	it	's	even	built	to	a	 high 	 er 	 	level	of	design	.
the	crud	in	the	front	is	mattress	 stuff 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	see	that	all	over	 tur 	 key 	 	.

and	it	's	built	to	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	high	standard	of	design	.
and	then	you	 final 	 ly 	 	get	 squat 	 ter 	 	 home 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	built	on	the	 sub 	 urban 	 	model	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 shop 	 ping 	 	street	in	kibera	,	and	you	can	see	that	there	's	a	soda	 deal 	 er 	 	,	a	health	clinic	,	two	 beaut 	 y 	 	 s 	 al 	 on 	 s 	 	,	a	bar	,	two	 grocer 	 y 	 	 store 	 s 	 	,	and	a	church	,	and	more	.

and	what	hotel	 mean 	 s 	 	,	in	kenya	and	india	,	is	an	eating	-	place	.
so	,	that	's	a	restaurant	.

talk	about	more	plastic	 bag 	 s 	 	than	plankton	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	have	natural	trash	-	 dispos 	 al 	 	.
and	when	they	have	more	money	they	cement	 the 	 ir 	 	 street 	 s 	 	,	and	they	put	in	 sew 	 ers 	 	and	good	water	 pipe 	 s 	 	,	and	stuff	like	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	water	going	to	rio	.	people	run	 the 	 ir 	 	water	 pipe 	 s 	 	all	over	the	place	,	and	that	little	hut	right	there	 ha 	 s 	 	a	pump	in	it	,	and	that	's	what	people	do	:	they	steal	 electric 	 ity 	 	;	they	install	a	pump	and	they	tap	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	main	,	and	pump	water	up	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 house 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	question	is	how	do	you	go	from	the	mud	-	hut	village	,	to	the	more	 develop 	 ed 	 	city	,	to	the	even	 high 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	sultanbelyi	?
i	say	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	is	people	need	a	guarantee	they	wo	n't	be	 e 	 vict 	 ed 	 	.
that	 do 	 es 	 	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	mean	 proper 	 ty 	 	 right 	 s 	 	,	and	i	would	disagree	with	hernando	de	soto	on	that	question	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	 right 	 s 	 	create	a	lot	of	 complic 	 ations 	 	.
they	're	most	often	 s 	 old 	 	to	people	,	and	people	then	wind	up	in	debt	and	have	to	pay	back	the	debt	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	have	to	sell	 the 	 ir 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	in	order	to	pay	back	the	debt	.
there	's	a	whole	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	other	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 proper 	 ty 	 	 right 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	do	n't	work	in	these	 case 	 s 	 	,	but	they	do	need	security	of	 ten 	 ure 	 	.
and	they	need	access	to	 politic 	 s 	 	,	and	that	can	mean	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
that	can	mean	community	 organ 	 izing 	 	from	 be 	 low 	 	,	but	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	mean	 possibil 	 ities 	 	from	above	.
and	i	say	that	 be 	 cause 	 	the	system	in	 tur 	 key 	 	is	 not 	 able 	 	.
 tur 	 key 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	two	great	 law 	 s 	 	that	protect	 squat 	 ter 	 s 	 	.
one	is	that	--	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	gecekondu	``	in	turkish	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	``	built	 over 	 night 	 	,	``	and	if	you	build	your	house	 over 	 night 	 	in	 tur 	 key 	 	,	you	ca	n't	be	 e 	 vict 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	due	process	of	law	,	if	they	do	n't	catch	you	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	night	.
and	the	second	 a 	 spect 	 	is	that	once	you	have	2,000	people	in	the	community	,	you	can	petition	the	government	to	be	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	legal	sub	-	municipality	.
and	when	you	're	a	legal	sub	-	municipality	,	you	 sudden 	 ly 	 	have	 politic 	 s 	 	.
you	're	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	have	an	 elect 	 ed 	 	government	,	collect	 tax 	 es 	 	,	provide	municipal	 service 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	they	do	.
so	,	these	are	the	civic	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	the	future	.
the	woman	in	the	center	is	geeta	jiwa	.
she	 live 	 s 	 	in	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 tent 	 s 	 	on	the	 high 	 way 	 	 med 	 ian 	 	in	mumbai	.
that	's	sureka	gundi	;	she	 al 	 so 	 	 live 	 s 	 	with	her	family	on	the	tent	 a 	 long 	 	the	same	 high 	 way 	 	 med 	 ian 	 	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 out 	 spoken 	 	.	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	active	.
they	can	be	community	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	woman	is	nine	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	``	grandma	``	in	turkish	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	three	old	 lad 	 ies 	 	who	lived	in	--	that	's	her	self	-	built	house	 be 	 hind 	 	her	--	and	they	've	lived	there	for	30	or	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	they	are	the	 back 	 bone 	 	of	the	community	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	richard	muthama	peter	,	and	he	is	an	 itiner 	 ant 	 	street	 photograph 	 er 	 	in	kibera	.
he	 make 	 s 	 	money	taking	 picture 	 s 	 	of	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	and	the	people	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	and	is	a	great	resource	in	the	community	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	my	choice	to	run	for	mayor	of	rio	is	cezinio	,	the	fruit	 merchan 	 t 	 	with	his	two	 kid 	 s 	 	here	,	and	a	more	honest	and	giving	and	 car 	 ing 	 	man	i	do	n't	know	.
the	future	of	these	 commun 	 ities 	 	is	in	the	people	and	in	our	ability	to	work	with	 t 	 hose 	 	people	.
so	,	i	think	the	 mess 	 age 	 	i	take	,	from	what	i	read	from	the	book	,	from	what	armstrong	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	from	all	these	people	,	is	that	these	are	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
the	issue	is	not	urban	poverty	.
the	issue	is	not	the	 large 	 r 	 	,	over	-	 arch 	 ing 	 	thing	.
the	issue	is	for	us	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	these	are	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	legitimate	form	of	urban	 develop 	 ment 	 	--	and	that	cities	have	to	engage	these	 resident 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	building	the	cities	of	the	future	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
