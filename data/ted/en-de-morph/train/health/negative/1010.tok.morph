i	grew	up	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	village	in	canada	,	and	i	'm	an	 un 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	.
i	had	a	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	time	in	school	.
in	fact	,	my	mother	told	me	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	that	i	was	the	little	kid	in	the	village	who	 cri 	 ed 	 	all	the	way	to	school	.
i	ran	away	.
i	left	when	i	was	25	 year 	 s 	 	old	to	go	to	bali	,	and	there	i	met	my	 in 	 credible 	 	wife	,	cynthia	,	and	together	,	over	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	built	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 jewel 	 ry 	 	business	.
it	was	a	 fair 	 y 	 	tale	,	and	then	we	 retire 	 d 	 	.
then	she	took	me	to	see	a	film	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	want	to	see	.
it	 ruin 	 ed 	 	my	life	--	``	the	 in 	 convenient 	 	truth	``	and	mr.	gore	.
i	have	four	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	even	if	part	of	what	he	 say 	 s 	 	is	true	,	they	're	not	going	to	have	the	life	that	i	had	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	at	that	moment	that	i	would	 s 	 pend 	 	the	rest	of	my	life	 do 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	i	could	to	improve	 the 	 ir 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
so	here	's	the	world	,	and	here	we	are	in	bali	.
it	's	a	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	 is 	 land 	 	--	60	 mile 	 s 	 	by	90	 mile 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 tact 	 	hindu	culture	.
cynthia	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	there	.
we	had	had	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	life	there	,	and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	back	 local 	 ly 	 	.
and	here	it	is	:	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	green	school	.
i	know	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	a	school	,	but	it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	,	and	it	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	,	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	green	.
the	 class 	 rooms 	 	have	no	 wall 	 s 	 	.
the	teacher	is	writing	on	a	bamboo	 black 	 board 	 	.
the	 desk 	 s 	 	are	not	square	.
at	green	school	,	the	children	are	 smil 	 ing 	 	--	an	 un 	 usual 	 	thing	for	school	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	me	.
and	we	practice	 hol 	 ism 	 	.
and	for	me	it	's	just	the	idea	that	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	 graduate 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	person	,	 chance 	 s 	 	are	she	'll	demand	a	whole	world	--	a	whole	world	--	to	live	on	.
our	children	 s 	 pend 	 	181	 day 	 s 	 	going	to	school	in	a	box	.
the	people	that	built	my	school	 al 	 so 	 	built	the	 pri 	 son 	 	and	the	 insan 	 e 	 	asylum	out	of	the	same	 material 	 s 	 	.
so	if	 th 	 is 	 	 gentle 	 man 	 	had	had	a	 hol 	 istic 	 	education	,	would	he	be	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	?
would	he	have	had	more	 possibil 	 ities 	 	in	his	life	?
the	 class 	 rooms 	 	have	natural	light	.
they	're	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.	they	're	bamboo	.
the	breeze	 pass 	 es 	 	through	them	.
and	when	the	natural	breeze	is	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	,	the	 kid 	 s 	 	deploy	 bubble 	 s 	 	,	but	not	the	kind	of	 bubble 	 s 	 	you	know	.
these	 bubble 	 s 	 	are	made	from	natural	cotton	and	rubber	from	the	rubber	tree	.
so	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	box	 in 	 to 	 	a	bubble	.
and	these	 kid 	 s 	 	know	that	 pain 	 less 	 	climate	control	may	not	be	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	future	.
we	pay	the	bill	at	the	end	of	the	month	,	but	the	people	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	pay	the	bill	are	our	 grand 	 children 	 	.
we	have	to	teach	the	 kid 	 s 	 	that	the	world	is	not	 in 	 destruct 	 ible 	 	.
these	 kid 	 s 	 	did	a	little	graffiti	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 desk 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	for	two	extra	 course 	 s 	 	.
the	first	one	was	 call 	 ed 	 	 sand 	 ing 	 	and	the	second	one	was	 call 	 ed 	 	re	-	 wax 	 ing 	 	.
but	since	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	they	own	 t 	 hose 	 	 desk 	 s 	 	.
they	know	they	can	control	 the 	 ir 	 	world	.
we	're	on	the	grid	.	we	're	not	proud	of	it	.
but	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	energy	company	in	paris	is	taking	us	off	the	grid	with	solar	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	the	second	 vor 	 t 	 ex 	 	to	be	built	in	the	world	,	in	a	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	meter	drop	on	a	river	.
when	the	turbine	 drop 	 s 	 	in	,	it	will	produce	8,000	 watt 	 s 	 	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	day	and	night	.
and	you	know	what	these	are	.
there	's	 no 	 where 	 	to	flush	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	taking	our	waste	and	 mix 	 ing 	 	it	with	a	huge	amount	of	water	--	you	're	all	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	,	just	do	the	math	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	 time 	 s 	 	how	much	water	.
there	is	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	water	.
these	are	 com 	 post 	 	 toilet 	 s 	 	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	at	the	school	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	about	them	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	principal	.
and	they	work	.	people	use	them	.	people	are	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	you	should	think	about	 do 	 ing 	 	.
not	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	did	n't	work	.
the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	canvas	and	rubber	 sky 	 light 	 s 	 	got	eaten	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	in	six	 month 	 s 	 	.
we	had	to	replace	them	with	 recycl 	 able 	 	plastic	.
the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 drag 	 ged 	 	giant	pvc	 white 	 board 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
so	we	had	some	good	 idea 	 s 	 	:	we	took	old	 auto 	 mobile 	 	 wind 	 shield 	 s 	 	,	put	paper	 be 	 hind 	 	them	and	 create 	 d 	 	the	first	 alter 	 native 	 	to	the	 white 	 board 	 	.
green	school	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	in	south	-	central	bali	,	and	it	's	on	20	 acre 	 s 	 	of	 roll 	 ing 	 	garden	.
there	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	river	 travel 	 ing 	 	through	it	,	and	you	can	see	there	how	we	manage	to	get	 a 	 cross 	 	the	river	.
i	met	a	father	the	other	day	;	he	 look 	 ed 	 	a	little	 craze 	 d 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	welcome	to	green	school	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	on	an	 air 	 plane 	 	for	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.	``
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	``	why	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	had	a	dream	once	about	a	green	school	,	and	i	saw	a	picture	of	 th 	 is 	 	green	school	,	i	got	on	an	 air 	 plane 	 	.
in	august	i	'm	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	my	 son 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	great	thing	.
but	more	than	that	,	people	are	building	green	 house 	 s 	 	around	green	school	,	so	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	can	walk	to	school	on	the	 path 	 s 	 	.
and	people	are	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	green	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	green	 restaurant 	 s 	 	,	to	the	green	school	.
it	's	 be 	 coming 	 	a	community	.
it	's	 be 	 coming 	 	a	green	model	.
we	had	to	look	at	 every 	 thing 	 	.
no	 petro 	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	the	 pave 	 ment 	 	.
no	 pave 	 ment 	 	.
these	are	 volcan 	 ic 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	laid	by	hand	.
there	are	no	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	.
the	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	are	 grave 	 l 	 	.	they	flood	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	,	but	they	're	green	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	school	buffalo	.
he	's	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	eat	that	 f 	 ence 	 	for	 d 	 inner 	 	.
all	the	 f 	 ence 	 s 	 	at	green	school	are	green	.
and	when	the	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 move 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	gate	,	they	found	out	the	 f 	 ence 	 	was	made	out	of	tapioca	.
they	took	the	tapioca	 root 	 s 	 	up	to	the	kitchen	,	 slice 	 d 	 	them	 thin 	 ly 	 	and	made	 delic 	 ious 	 	 chip 	 s 	 	.
 land 	 s 	 cap 	 ing 	 	.
we	manage	to	keep	the	garden	that	was	there	running	right	up	to	the	edge	of	each	of	the	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
we	 drop 	 ped 	 	them	 gent 	 ly 	 	in	.
we	made	space	for	these	 guy 	 s 	 	who	are	bali	's	last	black	 pig 	 s 	 	.
and	the	school	cow	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	replace	the	 lawn 	 mow 	 er 	 	on	the	 play 	 ing 	 	field	.
these	young	 lad 	 ies 	 	are	living	in	a	rice	culture	,	but	they	know	 some 	 thing 	 	that	few	people	know	in	a	rice	culture	.
they	know	how	to	plant	 organ 	 ic 	 	rice	,	they	know	how	to	look	after	it	,	they	know	how	to	harvest	and	they	know	how	to	cook	it	.
they	're	part	of	the	rice	cycle	and	these	 skill 	 s 	 	will	be	 valu 	 able 	 	for	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	future	.
 th 	 is 	 	young	man	is	 pick 	 ing 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	.
we	feed	400	people	lunch	every	day	and	it	's	not	a	normal	lunch	.	there	's	no	gas	.
local	balinese	women	cook	the	food	on	 saw 	 dust 	 	 burn 	 ers 	 	using	 secret 	 s 	 	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 mother 	 s 	 	know	.
the	food	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.
green	school	is	a	place	of	 pioneer 	 s 	 	,	local	and	global	.
and	it	's	a	kind	of	 micro 	 cosm 	 	of	the	 global 	 ized 	 	world	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	from	25	 count 	 ries 	 	.
when	i	see	them	together	,	i	know	that	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	live	in	the	future	.
green	school	is	going	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	third	year	with	160	children	.
it	's	a	school	where	you	do	learn	 read 	 ing 	 	--	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	--	writing	--	i	was	bad	at	it	--	arithmetic	.
but	you	 al 	 so 	 	learn	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	learn	bamboo	building	.
you	practice	ancient	balinese	 art 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	mud	 wrestl 	 ing 	 	in	the	rice	 field 	 s 	 	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	love	it	.
the	 mother 	 s 	 	are	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	of	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	local	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	``	local	``	mean	?
local	 mean 	 s 	 	that	20	percent	of	the	population	of	the	school	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	balinese	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 commit 	 ment 	 	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	right	.
and	people	are	coming	forward	from	all	over	the	world	to	support	the	balinese	 scholar 	 ship 	 	fund	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 kid 	 s 	 	will	be	bali	's	next	green	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
the	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 a 	 s 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	student	body	,	and	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	 volunteer 	 s 	 	are	 pop 	 ping 	 	up	.
a	man	came	from	java	with	a	new	kind	of	 organ 	 ic 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
a	woman	came	from	africa	with	music	.
and	together	these	 volunteer 	 s 	 	and	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 deep 	 ly 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	creating	a	new	generation	of	global	,	green	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
the	green	school	effect	--	we	do	n't	know	what	it	is	.
we	need	 some 	 one 	 	to	come	and	 stud 	 y 	 	it	.
but	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	our	 learn 	 ing 	 	-	different	 kid 	 s 	 	--	 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	--	we	've	 re 	 named 	 	them	 pro 	 lexic 	 	--	are	 do 	 ing 	 	well	in	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
and	all	the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 thriv 	 ing 	 	.
and	how	did	we	do	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
on	giant	grass	.
it	's	bamboo	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	ground	like	a	train	.
it	 grow 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	a	coconut	tree	in	two	 month 	 s 	 	and	three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	it	can	be	 harvest 	 ed 	 	to	build	 building 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	strong	and	dense	 a 	 s 	 	 tea 	 k 	 	and	it	will	hold	up	any	roof	.
when	the	 architect 	 s 	 	came	,	they	 br 	 ought 	 	us	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	yellow	box	was	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 administr 	 ation 	 	complex	.
we	 s 	 quashed 	 	it	,	we	 re 	 thought 	 	it	,	but	 main 	 ly 	 	we	 re 	 named 	 	it	``	the	heart	of	school	,	``	and	that	 change 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
it	's	a	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 administr 	 ators 	 	in	it	and	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	the	problem	of	building	it	--	when	the	balinese	 work 	 ers 	 	saw	long	 re 	 am 	 s 	 	of	 plan 	 s 	 	,	they	 look 	 ed 	 	at	them	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
so	we	built	big	 model 	 s 	 	.
we	had	them	engineered	by	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	.
and	balinese	 carp 	 enter 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	them	with	 the 	 ir 	 	bamboo	 rul 	 ers 	 	,	 select 	 ed 	 	the	bamboo	and	built	the	 building 	 s 	 	using	age	-	old	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	by	hand	.
it	was	 cha 	 os 	 	.
and	the	balinese	 carp 	 enter 	 s 	 	want	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	modern	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	,	so	they	use	metal	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	to	build	the	bamboo	building	and	when	the	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	came	down	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	had	a	 cat 	 hedral 	 	,	a	 cat 	 hedral 	 	to	green	,	and	a	 cat 	 hedral 	 	to	green	education	.
the	heart	of	school	 ha 	 s 	 	seven	 kilometer 	 s 	 	of	bamboo	in	it	.
from	the	time	the	 found 	 ations 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	in	three	 month 	 s 	 	it	had	 roof 	 s 	 	and	 floor 	 s 	 	.
it	may	not	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	bamboo	building	in	the	world	,	but	 man 	 y 	 	people	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	's	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 able 	 	in	your	community	?
we	 believ 	 e 	 	it	is	.
green	school	is	a	model	we	built	for	the	world	.
it	's	a	model	we	built	for	bali	.
and	you	just	have	to	follow	these	simple	,	simple	 rule 	 s 	 	:	be	local	,	let	the	environment	lead	and	think	about	how	your	 grand 	 children 	 	might	build	.
so	,	mr.	gore	,	thank	you	.
you	 ruin 	 ed 	 	my	life	,	but	you	 g 	 ave 	 	me	an	 in 	 credible 	 	future	.
and	if	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 be 	 ing 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 finish 	 ing 	 	green	school	and	building	the	next	50	around	the	world	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	come	and	see	us	.
thank	you	.
