last	year	,	i	told	you	the	story	,	in	seven	 minute 	 s 	 	,	of	project	orion	,	which	was	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 im 	 plausible 	 	technology	that	 technical 	 ly 	 	could	have	 work 	 ed 	 	,	but	it	had	 th 	 is 	 	one	-	year	 politic 	 al 	 	window	where	it	could	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
so	it	did	n't	happen	.	it	was	a	dream	that	did	not	happen	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	the	story	of	the	birth	of	digital	computing	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	perfect	 introduc 	 tion 	 	.
and	it	's	a	story	that	did	work	.	it	did	happen	,	and	the	 machine 	 s 	 	are	all	around	us	.
and	it	was	a	technology	that	was	 inevit 	 able 	 	.
if	the	people	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	the	story	about	,	if	they	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	it	,	 some 	 body 	 	else	would	have	.
so	,	it	was	sort	of	the	right	idea	at	the	right	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	barricelli	's	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	we	live	in	now	.
it	's	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	in	which	these	 machine 	 s 	 	are	now	 do 	 ing 	 	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	changing	biology	.
i	'm	 start 	 ing 	 	the	story	with	the	first	atomic	bomb	at	trinity	,	which	was	the	manhattan	project	.	it	was	a	little	bit	like	ted	:	it	 br 	 ought 	 	a	whole	lot	of	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	people	together	.
and	three	of	the	 smart 	 est 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	stan	ulam	,	richard	feynman	and	john	von	neumann	.
and	it	was	von	neumann	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	after	the	bomb	,	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	much	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	 bomb 	 s 	 	:	he	's	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 computer 	 s 	 	.
so	,	he	was	n't	 on 	 ly 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	them	;	he	built	one	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	machine	he	built	.
he	built	 th 	 is 	 	machine	,	and	we	had	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	with	these	little	bits	.	and	it	's	an	idea	that	 go 	 es 	 	way	back	.
the	first	person	to	 re 	 ally 	 	explain	that	was	thomas	hobbes	,	who	,	in	1651	,	 explain 	 ed 	 	how	arithmetic	and	logic	are	the	same	thing	,	and	if	you	want	to	do	artificial	 think 	 ing 	 	and	artificial	logic	,	you	can	do	it	all	with	arithmetic	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	you	 need 	 ed 	 	 add 	 ition 	 	and	 subtract 	 ion 	 	.
leibniz	,	who	came	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	1679	--	 show 	 ed 	 	that	you	did	n't	even	need	 subtract 	 ion 	 	.
you	could	do	the	whole	thing	with	 add 	 ition 	 	.
here	,	we	have	all	the	 bin 	 ary 	 	arithmetic	and	logic	that	drove	the	computer	revolution	.
and	leibniz	was	the	first	person	to	 re 	 ally 	 	talk	about	building	 s 	 uch 	 	a	machine	.
he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 do 	 ing 	 	it	with	 mar 	 ble 	 s 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 gate 	 s 	 	and	what	we	now	call	shift	 register 	 s 	 	,	where	you	shift	the	 gate 	 s 	 	,	drop	the	 mar 	 ble 	 s 	 	down	the	 track 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	all	these	 machine 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	with	 mar 	 ble 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	with	 electron 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	jump	to	von	neumann	,	1945	,	when	he	sort	of	 re 	 invent 	 s 	 	the	whole	same	thing	.
and	1945	,	after	the	war	,	the	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	try	and	build	 s 	 uch 	 	a	machine	.
so	june	1945	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	bomb	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	even	 be 	 en 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	yet	--	and	von	neumann	is	 put 	 ting 	 	together	all	the	 theor 	 y 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	build	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	which	 al 	 so 	 	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	turing	,	who	,	before	that	,	 g 	 ave 	 	the	idea	that	you	could	do	all	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 brain 	 less 	 	,	little	,	 fin 	 ite 	 	state	machine	,	just	 read 	 ing 	 	a	tape	in	and	 read 	 ing 	 	a	tape	out	.
the	other	sort	of	genesis	of	what	von	neumann	did	was	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	of	how	you	would	predict	the	weather	.
lewis	richardson	saw	how	you	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	cellular	array	of	people	,	giving	them	each	a	little	chunk	,	and	 put 	 ting 	 	it	together	.
here	,	we	have	an	 electric 	 al 	 	model	 illustr 	 ating 	 	a	mind	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	will	,	but	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	computer	.
it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	why	you	need	the	 qu 	 bit 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	you	put	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	together	,	you	get	the	 essential 	 s 	 	of	the	modern	computer	:	the	arithmetic	unit	,	the	central	control	,	the	 memor 	 y 	 	,	the	 record 	 ing 	 	medium	,	the	 in 	 put 	 	and	the	 out 	 put 	 	.
but	,	there	's	one	catch	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	fatal	--	you	know	,	we	saw	it	in	 start 	 ing 	 	these	 program 	 s 	 	up	.
the	 instruct 	 ions 	 	which	govern	 th 	 is 	 	operation	must	be	 give 	 n 	 	in	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 exhaust 	 ive 	 	detail	.
so	,	the	 programm 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	perfect	,	or	it	wo	n't	work	.
if	you	look	at	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	classic	 histo 	 ry 	 	sort	of	 take 	 s 	 	it	all	back	to	the	eniac	here	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	machine	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	,	the	institute	for	 advance 	 d 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	machine	,	which	is	way	up	there	,	 re 	 ally 	 	should	be	down	there	.	so	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	revise	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	give	some	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	more	credit	than	they	've	had	.
 s 	 uch 	 	a	computer	would	open	up	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	,	which	are	,	at	the	present	,	 out 	 side 	 	the	range	of	any	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 open 	 s 	 	up	a	whole	new	world	,	and	these	people	saw	it	.
the	guy	who	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	machine	was	the	guy	in	the	middle	,	vladimir	zworykin	,	from	rca	.
rca	,	in	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	 lous 	 iest 	 	business	 decision 	 s 	 	of	all	time	,	 decide 	 d 	 	not	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	.
but	the	first	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	november	1945	,	 we 	 re 	 	at	rca	's	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	.
rca	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	off	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	 tele 	 vision 	 s 	 	are	the	future	,	not	 computer 	 s 	 	.
the	 essential 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	there	--	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	these	 machine 	 s 	 	run	.
von	neumann	,	and	a	 logic 	 ian 	 	,	and	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	from	the	 arm 	 y 	 	put	 th 	 is 	 	together	.	then	,	they	 need 	 ed 	 	a	place	to	build	it	.
when	rca	 s 	 aid 	 	no	,	that	's	when	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	build	it	in	princeton	,	where	freeman	 work 	 s 	 	at	the	institute	.
that	's	where	i	grew	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	.
that	's	me	,	that	's	my	sister	esther	,	who	's	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	you	before	,	so	we	both	go	back	to	the	birth	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
that	's	freeman	,	a	long	time	ago	,	and	that	was	me	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	von	neumann	and	morgenstern	,	who	wrote	the	``	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 game 	 s 	 	.	``
all	these	 force 	 s 	 	came	together	there	,	in	princeton	.
oppenheimer	,	who	had	built	the	bomb	.
the	machine	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	 main 	 ly 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	bomb	 calcul 	 ations 	 	.
and	julian	bigelow	,	who	took	zworkykin	's	place	 a 	 s 	 	the	engineer	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	figure	out	,	using	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	how	you	would	build	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.	the	whole	gang	of	people	who	came	to	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	women	in	front	,	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	most	of	the	 cod 	 ing 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	 programm 	 ers 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	the	prototype	 geek 	 s 	 	,	the	 nerd 	 s 	 	.
they	did	n't	fit	in	at	the	institute	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	letter	from	the	director	,	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	--	``	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 un 	 fair 	 	on	the	matter	of	sugar	.	``
you	can	read	the	text	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 hack 	 ers 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	in	trouble	for	the	first	time	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	not	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 physicist 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	real	 s 	 old 	 er 	 ing 	 	-	gun	type	 guy 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	built	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
and	we	take	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	now	,	that	each	of	these	 machine 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 transistor 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 cycle 	 s 	 	per	second	 with 	 out 	 	 fail 	 ing 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	using	vacuum	 tube 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	narrow	,	 slop 	 py 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	get	 actual 	 ly 	 	 bin 	 ary 	 	behavior	out	of	these	radio	vacuum	 tube 	 s 	 	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	6j6	,	the	common	radio	tube	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	found	they	 we 	 re 	 	more	 reli 	 able 	 	than	the	more	expensive	 tube 	 s 	 	.
and	what	they	did	at	the	institute	was	publish	every	step	of	the	way	.
 report 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 issue 	 d 	 	,	so	that	 th 	 is 	 	machine	was	 clon 	 ed 	 	at	15	other	 place 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	was	.	it	was	the	original	 micro 	 processor 	 	.
all	the	 computer 	 s 	 	now	are	copies	of	that	machine	.
the	 memor 	 y 	 	was	in	 cath 	 o 	 de 	 	ray	 tube 	 s 	 	--	a	whole	bunch	of	 spot 	 s 	 	on	the	face	of	the	tube	--	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	sensitive	to	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 disturb 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
so	,	there	's	40	of	these	 tube 	 s 	 	,	like	a	v	-	40	engine	running	the	 memor 	 y 	 	.
the	 in 	 put 	 	and	the	 out 	 put 	 	was	by	 tele 	 type 	 	tape	at	first	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	wire	drive	,	using	 bi 	 cycle 	 	 wheel 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 arche 	 type 	 	of	the	hard	 dis 	 k 	 	that	's	in	your	machine	now	.
then	they	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	to	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	drum	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 modify 	 ing 	 	ibm	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	which	is	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	the	whole	data	-	 process 	 ing 	 	industry	,	 lat 	 er 	 	at	ibm	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	computer	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
the	``	graph'g	-	beam	turn	on	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	next	slide	,	that	's	the	--	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	know	--	the	first	digital	 bit 	 map 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	,	1954	.
so	,	von	neumann	was	 al 	 ready 	 	off	in	a	 theoretic 	 al 	 	cloud	,	 do 	 ing 	 	abstract	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	how	you	could	build	 reli 	 able 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	out	of	 un 	 reli 	 able 	 	 component 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	all	the	tea	with	sugar	in	it	 we 	 re 	 	writing	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 log 	 book 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	thing	to	work	,	with	all	these	2,600	vacuum	 tube 	 s 	 	that	 fail 	 ed 	 	half	the	time	.
and	that	's	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	last	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	is	going	through	the	 log 	 s 	 	.
``	running	time	:	two	 minute 	 s 	 	.	 in 	 put 	 	,	 out 	 put 	 	:	90	 minute 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 include 	 s 	 	a	large	amount	of	human	error	.
so	they	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	,	what	's	machine	error	?	what	's	human	error	?
what	's	code	,	what	's	 hard 	 ware 	 	?
that	's	an	engineer	 gaz 	 ing 	 	at	tube	number	36	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	why	the	 memor 	 y 	 	's	not	in	focus	.
he	had	to	focus	the	 memor 	 y 	 	--	 seem 	 s 	 	ok	.
so	,	he	had	to	focus	each	tube	just	to	get	the	 memor 	 y 	 	up	and	running	,	let	 al 	 one 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
``	no	use	,	went	home	.	``
``	 im 	 possible 	 	to	follow	the	damn	thing	,	where	's	a	 director 	 y 	 	?	``
so	,	 al 	 ready 	 	,	they	're	 complain 	 ing 	 	about	the	 manual 	 s 	 	:	``	before	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	down	in	disgust	...	``	``	the	general	arithmetic	:	 oper 	 ating 	 	 log 	 s 	 	.	``

so	,	 no 	 body 	 	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	know	they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	 bomb 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 design 	 ing 	 	hydrogen	 bomb 	 s 	 	.	but	 some 	 one 	 	in	the	 log 	 book 	 	,	late	one	night	,	 final 	 ly 	 	drew	a	bomb	.
so	,	that	was	the	result	.	it	was	 mi 	 ke 	 	,	the	first	 thermo 	 nuclear 	 	bomb	,	in	1952	.
that	was	designed	on	that	machine	,	in	the	 wood 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	institute	.
so	von	neumann	 invit 	 ed 	 	a	whole	gang	of	 weird 	 os 	 	from	all	over	the	world	to	work	on	all	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.

so	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	next	tuesday	,	i	guess	.
and	he	saw	 every 	 thing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	--	he	could	read	the	 bin 	 ary 	 	code	straight	off	the	machine	.
he	had	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 rap 	 port 	 	.
other	people	could	n't	get	the	machine	running	.	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	for	him	.
even	 error 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 duplic 	 ated 	 	.
``	dr.	barricelli	 claim 	 s 	 	machine	is	wrong	,	code	is	right	.	``
so	he	designed	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	ran	it	.
when	the	bomb	people	went	home	,	he	was	 allow 	 ed 	 	in	there	.
he	would	run	that	thing	all	night	long	,	running	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	if	 any 	 body 	 	 remember 	 s 	 	stephen	wolfram	,	who	 re 	 invent 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
and	he	 publish 	 ed 	 	it	.	it	was	n't	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	and	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
``	if	it	's	that	easy	to	create	living	 organism 	 s 	 	,	why	not	create	a	few	 your 	 self 	 	?	``
so	,	he	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	it	a	try	,	to	start	 th 	 is 	 	artificial	biology	going	in	the	 machine 	 s 	 	.
and	he	found	all	these	,	sort	of	--	it	was	like	a	 natural 	 ist 	 	coming	in	and	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	5,000	-	byte	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	 see 	 ing 	 	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	that	we	see	in	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	,	in	biology	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	of	the	 generation 	 s 	 	of	his	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
but	they	're	just	going	to	stay	 number 	 s 	 	;	they	're	not	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
they	have	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	.
you	have	a	 gen 	 o 	 type 	 	and	you	have	to	have	a	 pheno 	 type 	 	.
they	have	to	go	out	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.	and	he	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	 start 	 ed 	 	giving	these	little	 numeric 	 al 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	they	could	play	with	--	 play 	 ing 	 	 ches 	 s 	 	with	other	 machine 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
and	they	did	start	to	evolve	.
and	he	went	around	the	country	after	that	.
every	time	there	was	a	new	,	fast	machine	,	he	 start 	 ed 	 	using	it	,	and	saw	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	.
that	the	 program 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	off	--	when	you	quit	the	program	,	you	'd	keep	running	and	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	all	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 window 	 s 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	,	running	 a 	 s 	 	a	multi	-	cellular	organism	on	 man 	 y 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	he	 envision 	 ed 	 	all	that	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	he	saw	that	evolution	 it 	 self 	 	was	an	intelligent	process	.
it	was	n't	any	sort	of	creator	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	but	the	thing	 it 	 self 	 	was	a	giant	parallel	computation	that	would	have	some	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
and	he	went	out	of	his	way	to	say	that	he	was	not	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	 life 	 like 	 	,	or	a	new	kind	of	life	.
it	just	was	 an 	 other 	 	version	of	the	same	thing	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	what	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	computer	and	what	nature	did	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	could	you	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	now	?
so	,	when	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	these	 archiv 	 es 	 	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	the	 archiv 	 ist 	 	came	up	one	day	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	think	we	found	 an 	 other 	 	box	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	out	.	``
and	it	was	his	 uni 	 verse 	 	on	punch	 card 	 s 	 	.
so	there	it	is	,	50	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	--	sort	of	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	.
that	's	the	 instruct 	 ions 	 	for	running	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	source	code	for	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	,	with	a	note	from	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	some	 problem 	 s 	 	.
``	there	must	be	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	code	that	you	have	n't	 explain 	 ed 	 	yet	.	``
and	i	think	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	truth	.	we	still	do	n't	understand	how	these	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 instruct 	 ions 	 	can	lead	to	increasing	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
what	's	the	 divid 	 ing 	 	line	between	when	that	is	 life 	 like 	 	and	when	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 al 	 ive 	 	?
these	 card 	 s 	 	,	now	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	me	 show 	 ing 	 	up	,	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	question	is	,	should	we	run	them	or	not	?
you	know	,	could	we	get	them	running	?
do	you	want	to	let	it	loose	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	?
these	 machine 	 s 	 	would	think	they	--	these	 organism 	 s 	 	,	if	they	came	back	to	life	now	--	 whet 	 her 	 	they	've	 di 	 ed 	 	and	gone	to	heaven	,	there	's	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
my	 lap 	 top 	 	is	10	thousand	million	 time 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	they	lived	in	when	barricelli	quit	the	project	.
he	was	 think 	 ing 	 	far	 a 	 head 	 	,	to	how	 th 	 is 	 	would	 re 	 ally 	 	grow	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	kind	of	life	.
and	that	's	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	!
when	juan	enriquez	told	us	about	these	12	trillion	bits	 be 	 ing 	 	 transfer 	 red 	 	back	and	forth	,	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	 genomic 	 s 	 	data	going	to	the	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	lab	,	that	's	what	barricelli	 imagin 	 ed 	 	:	that	 th 	 is 	 	digital	code	in	these	 machine 	 s 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	code	--	it	 al 	 ready 	 	is	 cod 	 ing 	 	from	 nuclei 	 c 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	since	,	you	know	,	since	we	 start 	 ed 	 	pcr	and	 synth 	 es 	 izing 	 	small	 string 	 s 	 	of	dna	.
and	real	soon	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	 synth 	 es 	 izing 	 	the	 protein 	 s 	 	,	and	,	like	steve	 show 	 ed 	 	us	,	that	just	 open 	 s 	 	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	world	.
it	's	a	world	that	von	neumann	 him 	 self 	 	 envision 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	after	he	 di 	 ed 	 	:	his	sort	of	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	 note 	 s 	 	on	self	-	 re 	 producing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	what	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	get	the	 machine 	 s 	 	sort	of	jump	-	 start 	 ed 	 	to	where	they	begin	to	 re 	 produce 	 	.
it	took	 re 	 ally 	 	three	people	:	barricelli	had	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	the	code	 a 	 s 	 	a	living	thing	;	von	neumann	saw	how	you	could	build	the	 machine 	 s 	 	--	that	now	,	last	count	,	four	million	of	these	von	neumann	 machine 	 s 	 	is	built	every	24	 hour 	 s 	 	;	and	julian	bigelow	,	who	 di 	 ed 	 	10	 day 	 s 	 	ago	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	john	markoff	's	 o 	 bit 	 uary 	 	for	him	--	he	was	the	 import 	 ant 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	link	,	the	engineer	who	came	in	and	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	put	 t 	 hose 	 	vacuum	 tube 	 s 	 	together	and	make	it	work	.
and	all	our	 computer 	 s 	 	have	,	 in 	 side 	 	them	,	the	copies	of	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	he	had	to	just	design	one	day	,	sort	of	on	pencil	and	paper	.
and	we	owe	a	tremendous	credit	to	that	.
and	he	 explain 	 ed 	 	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	way	,	the	spirit	that	 br 	 ought 	 	all	these	different	people	to	the	institute	for	 advance 	 d 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	in	the	'40s	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	and	make	it	 free 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	with	no	 patent 	 s 	 	,	no	 restrict 	 ions 	 	,	no	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	 disput 	 es 	 	to	the	rest	of	the	world	.
that	's	the	last	entry	in	the	 log 	 book 	 	when	the	machine	was	shut	down	,	july	1958	.
and	it	's	julian	bigelow	who	was	running	it	 un 	 til 	 	 mid 	 night 	 	when	the	machine	was	 official 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	off	.
and	that	's	the	end	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
