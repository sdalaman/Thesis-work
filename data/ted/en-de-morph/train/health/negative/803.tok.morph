so	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	we	have	public	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	public	 official 	 s 	 	who	are	out	of	control	;	they	are	writing	 bill 	 s 	 	that	are	 un 	 intellig 	 ible 	 	,	and	out	of	these	 bill 	 s 	 	are	going	to	come	 may 	 be 	 	40,000	 page 	 s 	 	of	 regulat 	 ions 	 	,	total	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 dramat 	 ically 	 	negative	impact	on	our	life	.
if	you	're	a	veteran	coming	back	from	 ir 	 aq 	 	or	vietnam	you	face	a	 blizz 	 ard 	 	of	 paper 	 work 	 	to	get	your	 benefit 	 s 	 	;	if	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	small	business	loan	,	you	face	a	 blizz 	 ard 	 	of	 paper 	 work 	 	.
what	are	we	going	to	do	about	it	?	i	define	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mean 	 s 	 	to	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 clar 	 ity 	 	,	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	and	 empath 	 y 	 	,	building	 human 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 simpl 	 ifying 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	come	out	of	the	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	and	design	business	.
my	focus	is	 understand 	 ing 	 	you	people	,	and	how	you	interact	with	the	government	to	get	your	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	how	you	interact	with	 corporation 	 s 	 	to	decide	whom	you	're	going	to	do	business	with	,	and	how	you	view	 brand 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	when	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	see	why	we	ca	n't	have	a	one	-	page	,	plain	english	consumer	credit	 agree 	 ment 	 	.	``
so	,	i	 lock 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	in	a	room	,	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	the	content	,	 organize 	 d 	 	the	document	,	and	wrote	it	in	plain	english	.
i	've	had	 th 	 is 	 	 check 	 ed 	 	by	the	two	top	consumer	credit	 lawyer 	 s 	 	in	the	country	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	thing	.
now	,	i	went	one	step	further	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	we	have	to	stick	with	the	stodgy	 lawyer 	 s 	 	and	just	have	a	paper	document	?	let	's	go	 on 	 line 	 	.	``
and	 man 	 y 	 	people	might	need	help	in	computation	.
 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	harvard	business	school	,	you	'll	see	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	when	you	talk	about	 minim 	 um 	 	payment	:	if	you	 s 	 pent 	 	62	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	a	meal	,	the	 long 	 er 	 	you	take	to	pay	out	that	loan	,	you	see	,	over	a	period	of	time	using	the	 minim 	 um 	 	payment	it	's	99	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	17	 cent 	 s 	 	.
how	about	that	?	do	you	think	your	bank	is	going	to	show	that	to	people	?
but	it	's	going	to	work	.	it	's	more	effective	than	just	 computation 	 al 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	.
and	what	about	 term 	 s 	 	like	``	over	the	limit	``	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	 steal 	 th 	 	thing	.
define	it	in	 con 	 text 	 	.	tell	people	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	.
when	you	put	it	in	plain	english	,	you	 al 	 most 	 	force	the	institution	to	give	the	people	a	way	,	a	default	out	of	that	,	and	not	put	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	at	risk	.
plain	english	is	about	changing	the	content	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	'm	most	proud	of	is	 th 	 is 	 	 agree 	 ment 	 	for	ibm	.
it	's	a	grid	,	it	's	a	calendar	.
at	 s 	 uch 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	a	date	,	ibm	 ha 	 s 	 	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	,	you	have	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	.
 receiv 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 favor 	 ably 	 	by	business	.
and	there	is	some	good	news	to	report	 to 	 day 	 	.
each	year	,	one	in	10	 taxpayer 	 s 	 	 receiv 	 es 	 	a	notice	from	the	irs	.
there	are	200	million	 letter 	 s 	 	that	go	out	.
running	through	 th 	 is 	 	typical	letter	that	they	had	,	i	ran	it	through	my	 simpl 	 icity 	 	lab	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 intellig 	 ible 	 	.
all	the	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	document	in	red	are	not	 intellig 	 ible 	 	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 do 	 ing 	 	over	1,000	 letter 	 s 	 	that	cover	70	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	in	plain	english	.
they	have	 be 	 en 	 	tested	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	.
when	i	run	it	through	my	lab	,	 th 	 is 	 	heat	-	mapping	 show 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 intellig 	 ible 	 	.
and	the	irs	 ha 	 s 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	the	program	.
there	are	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	going	on	right	now	that	i	want	to	 br 	 ing 	 	to	your	attention	.
there	is	a	lot	of	 discuss 	 ion 	 	now	about	a	consumer	financial	 protect 	 ion 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	,	how	to	 man 	 date 	 	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
we	see	all	 th 	 is 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
it	's	 in 	 cum 	 bent 	 	 up 	 on 	 	us	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	to	make	 clar 	 ity 	 	,	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	and	 empath 	 y 	 	a	national	 prior 	 ity 	 	.
there	is	no	way	that	we	should	allow	government	to	communicate	the	way	they	communicate	.
there	is	no	way	we	should	do	business	with	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	have	 agree 	 ments 	 	with	 steal 	 th 	 	 pro 	 vision 	 s 	 	and	that	are	 un 	 intellig 	 ible 	 	.
so	,	how	are	we	going	to	change	the	world	?
make	 clar 	 ity 	 	,	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	and	 simpl 	 icity 	 	a	national	 prior 	 ity 	 	.
i	thank	you	.
