so	the	question	is	,	why	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	so	wrong	about	 some 	 thing 	 	so	 import 	 ant 	 	?	i	think	there	are	a	number	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	is	we	have	better	 report 	 ing 	 	.	the	 associate 	 d 	 	press	is	a	better	 chronic 	 ler 	 	of	 war 	 s 	 	over	the	surface	of	the	earth	than	sixteenth	-	century	 monk 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
there	's	a	cognitive	illusion	.	we	cognitive	 psycho 	 logists 	 	know	that	the	 eas 	 ier 	 	it	is	to	recall	specific	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	,	the	 high 	 er 	 	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	that	you	assign	to	it	.
 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	read	about	in	the	paper	with	gory	 foot 	 age 	 	burn	 in 	 to 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	more	than	 report 	 s 	 	of	a	lot	more	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 bed 	 s 	 	of	old	age	.	there	are	 dynamic 	 s 	 	in	the	opinion	and	 advoc 	 acy 	 	 market 	 s 	 	:	no	one	ever	 attract 	 ed 	 	 observ 	 ers 	 	,	 advoc 	 ates 	 	and	 donor 	 s 	 	by	 say 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	just	seem	to	be	 get 	 ting 	 	better	and	better	.
there	's	guilt	about	our	 treat 	 ment 	 	of	native	 people 	 s 	 	in	modern	intellectual	life	,	and	an	 un 	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	there	could	be	 any 	 thing 	 	good	about	western	culture	.
and	of	course	,	our	change	in	 standard 	 s 	 	can	 out 	 pace 	 	the	change	in	behavior	.	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	violence	went	down	is	that	people	got	sick	of	the	 car 	 n 	 age 	 	and	 cruel 	 ty 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	time	.
that	's	a	process	that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 continu 	 ing 	 	,	but	if	it	outstrips	behavior	by	the	 standard 	 s 	 	of	the	day	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	look	more	 bar 	 bar 	 ic 	 	than	they	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	by	historic	 standard 	 s 	 	.	so	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	get	 exercis 	 ed 	 	--	and	 right 	 ly 	 	so	--	if	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	 murder 	 ers 	 	get	 execute 	 d 	 	by	lethal	 inject 	 ion 	 	in	texas	after	a	15	-	year	appeal	process	.	we	do	n't	consider	that	a	couple	of	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	they	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	 burn 	 ed 	 	at	the	 s 	 take 	 	for	 critic 	 izing 	 	the	king	after	a	trial	that	 last 	 ed 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	that	that	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	look	at	capital	 punish 	 ment 	 	 a 	 s 	 	evidence	of	how	low	our	behavior	can	sink	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	how	high	our	 standard 	 s 	 	have	 ris 	 en 	 	.

the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	is	that	it	's	 li 	 able 	 	to	 hav 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	bluff	 call 	 ed 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	work	if	it	's	credible	.	to	make	it	credible	,	you	must	 a 	 venge 	 	all	 insult 	 s 	 	and	settle	all	 score 	 s 	 	,	which	 lead 	 s 	 	to	the	 cycle 	 s 	 	of	 blood 	 y 	 	 vend 	 e 	 tta 	 	.
life	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	episode	of	``	the	 soprano 	 s 	 	.	``	hobbes	'	solution	,	the	``	 le 	 via 	 than 	 	,	``	was	that	if	 author 	 ity 	 	for	the	legitimate	use	of	violence	was	 vest 	 ed 	 	in	a	single	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	--	a	 le 	 via 	 than 	 	--	then	 s 	 uch 	 	a	state	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 tempt 	 ation 	 	of	attack	,	 be 	 cause 	 	any	kind	of	 aggress 	 ion 	 	will	be	 punish 	 ed 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 profit 	 ability 	 	 a 	 s 	 	zero	.	that	would	 re 	 move 	 	the	 tempt 	 ation 	 	to	 invad 	 e 	 	 pre 	 emptive 	 ly 	 	,	out	of	fear	of	them	 attack 	 ing 	 	you	first	.
it	 re 	 move 	 s 	 	the	need	for	a	hair	trigger	for	 retali 	 ation 	 	to	make	your	 de 	 ter 	 rent 	 	threat	credible	.	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	it	would	lead	to	a	state	of	peace	.	eisner	--	the	man	who	 plot 	 ted 	 	the	 hom 	 icide 	 	rates	that	you	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	see	in	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	slide	--	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	of	the	decline	of	 hom 	 icide 	 	in	europe	 coincide 	 d 	 	with	the	rise	of	 central 	 ized 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	a	bit	of	a	support	for	the	 le 	 via 	 than 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	 support 	 ing 	 	it	is	the	fact	that	we	 to 	 day 	 	see	 erupt 	 ions 	 	of	violence	in	 zone 	 s 	 	of	 anarch 	 y 	 	,	in	 fail 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 collapse 	 d 	 	 empire 	 s 	 	,	 front 	 ier 	 	 region 	 s 	 	,	 mafia 	 s 	 	,	street	 gang 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
the	second	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	that	in	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	and	 place 	 s 	 	,	there	is	a	 wide 	 spread 	 	sentiment	that	life	is	cheap	.
in	 ear 	 lier 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	when	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	early	death	 we 	 re 	 	common	in	one	's	own	life	,	one	 ha 	 s 	 	 few 	 er 	 	 com 	 pun 	 ction 	 s 	 	about	 inflict 	 ing 	 	them	on	 other 	 s 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	technology	and	economic	efficiency	make	life	 long 	 er 	 	and	more	 pleas 	 ant 	 	,	one	 put 	 s 	 	a	 high 	 er 	 	value	on	life	in	general	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	argument	from	the	 politic 	 al 	 	scientist	james	payne	.
a	third	 explan 	 ation 	 	 invoke 	 s 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	a	nonzero	-	sum	game	,	and	was	 work 	 ed 	 	out	in	the	book	``	nonzero	``	by	the	journalist	robert	wright	.	wright	 point 	 s 	 	out	that	in	certain	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	 co 	 operation 	 	or	non	-	violence	can	benefit	both	 part 	 ies 	 	in	an	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 gain 	 s 	 	in	trade	when	two	 part 	 ies 	 	trade	 the 	 ir 	 	 sur 	 plus 	 es 	 	and	both	come	out	 a 	 head 	 	,	or	when	two	 part 	 ies 	 	lay	down	 the 	 ir 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	and	split	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	peace	 divid 	 end 	 	that	 result 	 s 	 	in	them	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	fight	the	whole	time	.
wright	 argu 	 es 	 	that	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	the	number	of	positive	-	sum	 game 	 s 	 	that	 human 	 s 	 	tend	to	be	 em 	 broil 	 ed 	 	in	,	by	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	trade	of	 good 	 s 	 	,	 service 	 s 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	over	 long 	 er 	 	 distance 	 s 	 	and	among	 large 	 r 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	.
the	result	is	that	other	people	 be 	 come 	 	more	 valu 	 able 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	than	dead	,	and	violence	 decline 	 s 	 	for	 self 	 ish 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.	 a 	 s 	 	wright	put	it	,	``	among	the	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	that	i	think	that	we	should	not	bomb	the	japanese	is	that	they	built	my	mini	-	van	.	``
the	fourth	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	 capture 	 d 	 	in	the	title	of	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 expand 	 ing 	 	circle	,	``	by	the	 philosoph 	 er 	 	peter	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	,	who	 argu 	 es 	 	that	evolution	 bequea 	 th 	 ed 	 	 human 	 s 	 	with	a	sense	of	 empath 	 y 	 	,	an	ability	to	treat	other	 people 	 s 	 	'	 interest 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 able 	 	to	one	's	own	.	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	by	default	we	 app 	 ly 	 	it	 on 	 ly 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	narrow	circle	of	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	.
people	 out 	 side 	 	that	circle	are	 treat 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	sub	-	human	,	and	can	be	 exploit 	 ed 	 	with	 imp 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	but	,	over	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	the	circle	 ha 	 s 	 	 expand 	 ed 	 	.	one	can	see	,	in	 historic 	 al 	 	record	,	it	 expand 	 ing 	 	from	the	village	,	to	the	 cl 	 an 	 	,	to	the	tribe	,	to	the	nation	,	to	other	 race 	 s 	 	,	to	both	 s 	 ex 	 es 	 	,	and	,	in	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	's	own	 argument 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	should	extend	to	other	 senti 	 ent 	 	species	.	the	question	is	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	what	 ha 	 s 	 	powered	that	expansion	?
and	there	are	a	number	of	 possibil 	 ities 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	increasing	 circle 	 s 	 	of	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	in	the	sense	that	robert	wright	 argu 	 es 	 	for	.
the	logic	of	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	--	the	more	you	think	about	and	interact	with	other	people	,	the	more	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	is	 un 	 ten 	 able 	 	to	privilege	your	 interest 	 s 	 	over	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	if	you	want	them	to	listen	to	you	.	you	ca	n't	say	that	my	 interest 	 s 	 	are	special	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 your 	 s 	 	,	 any 	 more 	 	than	you	can	say	that	the	 part 	 icular 	 	spot	that	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	is	a	 un 	 ique 	 	part	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	happen	to	be	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	it	that	 ver 	 y 	 	minute	.
it	may	 al 	 so 	 	be	powered	by	 cosmo 	 politan 	 ism 	 	,	by	 histo 	 ries 	 	,	and	 journal 	 ism 	 	,	and	 memoir 	 s 	 	,	and	realistic	fiction	,	and	travel	,	and	 liter 	 acy 	 	,	which	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	project	 your 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	other	people	that	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	you	may	have	 treat 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	sub	-	human	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	the	 accident 	 al 	 	 con 	 ting 	 ency 	 	of	your	own	station	in	life	,	the	sense	that	``	there	but	for	fortune	go	i.	``
 what 	 ever 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	,	the	decline	of	violence	,	i	think	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	.	it	should	force	us	to	ask	not	just	,	why	is	there	war	?	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	why	is	there	peace	?	not	just	,	what	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	wrong	?	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	what	have	we	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	right	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	right	,	and	it	 s 	 ure 	 	would	be	good	to	find	out	what	it	is	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

chris	anderson	:	i	 love 	 d 	 	that	talk	.	i	think	a	lot	of	people	here	in	the	room	would	say	that	that	expansion	of	--	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	that	peter	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	about	,	is	 al 	 so 	 	driven	by	,	just	by	technology	,	by	 great 	 er 	 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	of	the	other	,	and	the	sense	that	the	world	is	 there 	 fore 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 small 	 er 	 	.	i	mean	,	is	that	 al 	 so 	 	a	grain	of	truth	?
steven	pinker	:	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	it	would	fit	both	in	wright	's	 theor 	 y 	 	,	that	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	enjoy	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 co 	 operation 	 	over	 large 	 r 	 	and	 large 	 r 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	think	it	 help 	 s 	 	us	imagine	what	it	's	like	to	be	 some 	 one 	 	else	.	i	think	when	you	read	these	 horr 	 ific 	 	 torture 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	common	in	the	middle	 age 	 s 	 	,	you	think	,	how	could	they	possibly	have	 d 	 one 	 	it	,	how	could	they	have	not	have	empathized	with	the	person	that	they	're	 dis 	 em 	 bowel 	 ing 	 	?	but	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	an	alien	 be 	 ing 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	 a 	 kin 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.	 any 	 thing 	 	,	i	think	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	imagine	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	 place 	 s 	 	with	 some 	 one 	 	else	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	your	moral	 consider 	 ation 	 	to	that	other	person	.
ca	:	well	,	steve	,	i	would	love	every	news	media	owner	to	hear	that	talk	at	some	point	in	the	next	year	.	i	think	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	thank	you	so	much	.
