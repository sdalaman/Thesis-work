if	you	're	here	 to 	 day 	 	--	and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	that	you	are	--	you	've	all	heard	about	how	 sustain 	 able 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	will	 s 	 ave 	 	us	from	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	 how 	 ever 	 	,	when	we	're	not	at	ted	,	we	are	often	told	that	a	real	 sustain 	 ability 	 	policy	agenda	is	just	not	 feas 	 ible 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	large	,	urban	 area 	 s 	 	like	new	york	city	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	most	people	with	decision	-	making	 power 	 s 	 	,	in	both	the	public	and	the	private	sector	,	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	feel	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	in	danger	.
the	reason	why	i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	in	part	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	dog	:	an	 abandon 	 ed 	 	puppy	i	found	back	in	the	rain	,	back	in	1998	.
she	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	dog	than	i	'd	 anticip 	 ated 	 	.
when	she	came	 in 	 to 	 	my	life	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	against	a	huge	waste	 facil 	 ity 	 	 plan 	 ned 	 	for	the	east	river	 water 	 front 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	our	small	part	of	new	york	city	 al 	 ready 	 	 handle 	 d 	 	more	than	40	percent	of	the	entire	city	's	commercial	waste	:	a	 sew 	 age 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	 pel 	 let 	 izing 	 	plant	,	a	 sew 	 age 	 	sludge	plant	,	four	power	 plant 	 s 	 	,	the	world	's	largest	food	 distribut 	 ion 	 	center	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	other	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	that	 br 	 ing 	 	more	than	60,000	 dies 	 el 	 	truck	 trip 	 s 	 	to	the	area	each	week	.
the	area	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	one	of	the	 low 	 est 	 	 ratio 	 s 	 	of	 park 	 s 	 	to	people	in	the	city	.
so	when	i	was	 contact 	 ed 	 	by	the	 park 	 s 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	about	a	$	10,000	seed	grant	 initi 	 ative 	 	seed	grant	 initi 	 ative 	 	to	help	develop	 water 	 front 	 	 project 	 s 	 	,	i	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	-	meaning	,	but	a	bit	naive	.
i	'd	lived	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	all	my	life	,	and	you	could	not	get	to	the	river	 be 	 cause 	 	of	all	the	 love 	 ly 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	that	i	'd	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
then	,	while	 jog 	 ging 	 	with	my	dog	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	she	 pull 	 ed 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	what	i	thought	was	just	 an 	 other 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	dump	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 weed 	 s 	 	and	 pile 	 s 	 	of	garbage	and	other	stuff	that	i	wo	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	here	,	but	she	 ke 	 pt 	 	 drag 	 ging 	 	me	--	and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	at	the	end	of	that	lot	was	the	river	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 for 	 gotten 	 	little	street	-	end	,	 abandon 	 ed 	 	like	the	dog	that	 br 	 ought 	 	me	there	,	was	worth	saving	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	it	would	grow	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	proud	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	the	community	-	led	 re 	 vital 	 ization 	 	of	the	new	south	bronx	.
and	just	like	my	new	dog	,	it	was	an	idea	that	got	 big 	 ger 	 	than	i	'd	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.

we	 leverage 	 d 	 	that	$	10,000	seed	grant	more	than	300	 time 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	$	3	million	park	.

so	how	did	 thing 	 s 	 	get	so	different	for	us	?
in	the	late	'40s	,	my	dad	--	a	pullman	 port 	 er 	 	,	son	of	a	slave	--	 b 	 ought 	 	a	house	in	the	 hunt 	 s 	 	point	section	of	the	south	bronx	,	and	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	he	married	my	mom	.

so	now	,	my	family	's	 proper 	 ty 	 	was	 worth 	 less 	 	,	 s 	 ave 	 	for	that	it	was	our	home	and	all	we	had	.

that	small	park	i	told	you	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	was	the	first	stage	of	building	a	 green 	 way 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	in	the	south	bronx	.

or	 problem 	 s 	 	to	be	 solve 	 d 	 	by	empty	campaign	 promise 	 s 	 	of	 pre 	 sidents 	 	come	and	gone	.
now	will	we	let	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	coast	languish	for	a	decade	or	two	like	the	south	bronx	did	?
or	will	we	take	 pro 	 active 	 	 step 	 s 	 	and	learn	from	the	 home 	 grown 	 	resource	of	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	 activist 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	born	of	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	in	 commun 	 ities 	 	like	mine	?
now	listen	,	i	do	not	expect	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 corporation 	 s 	 	or	government	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	right	or	moral	.
 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	some	of	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	through	,	like	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	bit	.	you	've	no	clue	.
but	i	'll	tell	you	 lat 	 er 	 	if	you	want	to	know	.
but	--	i	know	it	's	the	bottom	line	,	or	one	's	 per 	 ception 	 	of	it	,	that	 motiv 	 ates 	 	people	in	the	end	.
i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	what	i	like	to	call	the	``	triple	bottom	line	``	that	 sustain 	 able 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	can	produce	.
 develop 	 ments 	 	that	have	the	potential	to	create	positive	 return 	 s 	 	for	all	 concern 	 ed 	 	:	the	 develop 	 ers 	 	,	government	and	the	community	where	these	 project 	 s 	 	go	up	.
at	present	,	that	's	not	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	new	york	city	.
and	we	are	 oper 	 ating 	 	with	a	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	urban	 plan 	 ning 	 	 defici 	 t 	 	.
a	 para 	 de 	 	of	government	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	is	going	to	 pro 	 posed 	 	big	-	box	and	 stad 	 ium 	 	 develop 	 ments 	 	in	the	south	bronx	,	but	there	is	 s 	 cant 	 	 coordi 	 nation 	 	between	city	 age 	 ncies 	 	on	how	to	deal	with	the	cumulative	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	traffic	,	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	solid	waste	and	the	 impact 	 s 	 	on	open	space	.	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 approach 	 es 	 	to	local	economic	and	job	 develop 	 ment 	 	are	so	 lam 	 e 	 	it	's	not	even	funny	.
 be 	 cause 	 	on	top	of	that	,	the	world	's	 rich 	 est 	 	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	team	is	 re 	 placing 	 	the	house	that	ruth	built	by	 destroy 	 ing 	 	two	well	-	 love 	 d 	 	community	 park 	 s 	 	.
now	,	we	'll	have	even	less	than	that	stat	i	told	you	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	less	than	25	percent	of	south	bronx	 resident 	 s 	 	own	 car 	 s 	 	,	these	 project 	 s 	 	include	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	new	 park 	 ing 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	yet	zip	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	mass	public	transit	.
now	,	what	's	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	from	the	 large 	 r 	 	debate	is	a	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	cost	-	benefit	analysis	between	not	 fix 	 ing 	 	an	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	,	 environment 	 ally 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	community	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 incorpo 	 rating 	 	structural	,	 sustain 	 able 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
my	 age 	 ncy 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	with	columbia	university	and	 other 	 s 	 	to	shine	a	light	on	these	 issue 	 s 	 	.
now	let	's	get	 th 	 is 	 	straight	.	i	am	not	anti	-	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
 our 	 s 	 	is	a	city	,	not	a	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	preserve	.	and	i	've	 embrace 	 d 	 	my	inner	 capital 	 ist 	 	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	all	have	it	,	and	if	you	have	n't	,	you	need	to	.
so	i	do	n't	have	a	problem	with	 develop 	 ers 	 	making	money	.
there	's	 en 	 ough 	 	 precede 	 nt 	 	out	there	to	show	that	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	community	-	friendly	 develop 	 ment 	 	can	still	make	a	fortune	.
fellow	tedsters	bill	mcdonough	and	amory	lovins	--	both	heroes	of	mine	by	the	way	--	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	that	.
i	do	have	a	problem	with	 develop 	 ments 	 	that	hyper	-	exploit	 politic 	 ally 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	for	profit	.
that	it	 continu 	 es 	 	is	a	shame	 up 	 on 	 	us	all	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	all	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	the	future	that	we	create	.
but	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	do	to	 re 	 mind 	 	 my 	 self 	 	of	 great 	 er 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	is	to	learn	from	 vision 	 aries 	 	in	other	cities	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	version	of	 global 	 ization 	 	.
let	's	take	bogota	.	poor	,	latino	,	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 run 	 away 	 	gun	violence	and	drug	 traffic 	 king 	 	:	a	reputation	not	 un 	 like 	 	that	of	the	south	bronx	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	city	was	 bless 	 ed 	 	in	the	late	1990s	with	a	 high 	 ly 	 	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	mayor	named	enrique	penalosa	.
he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
few	bogatanos	own	 car 	 s 	 	,	yet	a	huge	 port 	 ion 	 	of	the	city	's	 resource 	 s 	 	was	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	 serv 	 ing 	 	them	.
if	you	're	a	mayor	,	you	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	.
his	 administr 	 ation 	 	 narrow 	 ed 	 	key	municipal	 thorough 	 fare 	 s 	 	from	five	 lane 	 s 	 	to	three	,	 out 	 law 	 ed 	 	 park 	 ing 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 street 	 s 	 	,	 expand 	 ed 	 	pedestrian	 walk 	 ways 	 	and	bike	 lane 	 s 	 	,	 create 	 d 	 	public	 plaza 	 s 	 	,	 create 	 d 	 	one	of	the	most	efficient	bus	mass	-	transit	 system 	 s 	 	in	the	entire	world	.
for	his	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 effort 	 s 	 	,	he	was	 near 	 ly 	 	 im 	 peach 	 ed 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	people	 beg 	 an 	 	to	see	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	put	first	on	 issue 	 s 	 	 reflect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	day	-	to	-	day	 live 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
people	 stop 	 ped 	 	 litter 	 ing 	 	;	crime	rates	 drop 	 ped 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 street 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	with	people	.
his	 administr 	 ation 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	typical	urban	 problem 	 s 	 	at	one	time	,	and	on	a	third	-	world	budget	at	that	.
we	have	no	excuse	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.	i	'm	sorry	.
but	the	bottom	line	is	:	 the 	 ir 	 	people	-	first	agenda	was	not	 me 	 ant 	 	to	 penal 	 ize 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	afford	 car 	 s 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	to	provide	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	all	bogatanos	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	city	's	 resurg 	 ence 	 	.	that	 develop 	 ment 	 	should	not	come	at	the	expense	of	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	population	is	still	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	radical	idea	here	in	the	us	.
but	bogota	's	 ex 	 ample 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	power	to	change	that	.
you	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	are	 bless 	 ed 	 	with	the	gift	of	influence	.
that	's	why	you	're	here	and	why	you	value	the	information	we	 ex 	 change 	 	.
use	your	influence	in	support	of	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	change	 every 	 where 	 	.
do	n't	just	talk	about	it	at	ted	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 nation 	 wide 	 	policy	agenda	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	all	know	,	 politic 	 s 	 	are	personal	.
help	me	make	green	the	new	black	.	help	me	make	 sustain 	 ability 	 	sexy	.
make	it	a	part	of	your	 d 	 inner 	 	and	 cock 	 tail 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	.
help	me	fight	for	 environment 	 al 	 	and	economic	justice	.
support	 invest 	 ments 	 	with	a	triple	-	bottom	-	line	return	.
help	me	 democrat 	 ize 	 	 sustain 	 ability 	 	by	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 every 	 one 	 	to	the	table	and	 insist 	 ing 	 	that	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	 plan 	 ning 	 	can	be	 address 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
oh	good	,	glad	i	have	a	little	more	time	!
listen	--	when	i	spoke	to	mr.	gore	the	other	day	after	 break 	 fast 	 	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	how	 environment 	 al 	 	justice	 activist 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	 include 	 d 	 	in	his	new	 market 	 ing 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
his	 respons 	 e 	 	was	a	grant	program	.
i	do	n't	think	he	 under 	 stood 	 	that	i	was	n't	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 fund 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	making	him	an	 off 	 er 	 	.
what	 trouble 	 d 	 	me	was	that	 th 	 is 	 	top	-	down	approach	is	still	around	.
now	,	do	n't	get	me	wrong	,	we	need	money	.
but	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	 group 	 s 	 	are	 need 	 ed 	 	at	the	table	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	decision	-	making	process	.
of	the	90	percent	of	the	energy	that	mr.	gore	 re 	 minded 	 	us	that	we	waste	every	day	,	do	n't	add	 was 	 ting 	 	our	energy	,	 intellig 	 ence 	 	and	hard	-	 earn 	 ed 	 	experience	to	that	count	.
i	have	come	from	so	far	to	meet	you	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	waste	me	.	by	 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	we	can	 be 	 come 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	small	,	 rapid 	 ly 	 	growing	 group 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	the	 au 	 da 	 city 	 	and	courage	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	change	the	world	.
we	might	have	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	from	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 station 	 s 	 	in	life	,	but	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	we	all	share	one	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	thing	:	we	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	lose	and	 every 	 thing 	 	to	gain	.
