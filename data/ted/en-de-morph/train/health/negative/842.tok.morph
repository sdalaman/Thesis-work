good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
 give 	 n 	 	my	ted	profile	,	you	might	be	 expect 	 ing 	 	that	i	'm	going	to	speak	to	you	about	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	 trend 	 s 	 	--	the	one	that	's	 current 	 ly 	 	got	wall	street	and	the	world	bank	 buzz 	 ing 	 	--	how	to	invest	in	women	,	how	to	empower	them	,	how	to	 s 	 ave 	 	them	.
not	me	.
i	am	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	women	are	saving	us	.
they	're	saving	us	by	 re 	 defi 	 ning 	 	and	re	-	 imagin 	 ing 	 	a	future	that	 defi 	 es 	 	and	 blur 	 s 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	 polar 	 ities 	 	,	 polar 	 ities 	 	we	've	taken	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	for	a	long	time	,	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	between	 modern 	 ity 	 	and	tradition	,	first	world	and	third	world	,	 oppress 	 ion 	 	and	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	the	 daunt 	 ing 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	we	face	 a 	 s 	 	a	global	community	,	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	third	way	 rag 	 a 	 	that	is	making	my	heart	 s 	 ing 	 	.
what	 intrigu 	 es 	 	me	most	is	how	women	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	a	set	of	 paradox 	 es 	 	that	are	both	 frust 	 rating 	 	and	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
why	is	it	that	women	are	,	on	the	one	hand	,	 vic 	 iously 	 	 oppress 	 ed 	 	by	cultural	 practice 	 s 	 	,	and	yet	at	the	same	time	,	are	the	 preserve 	 rs 	 	of	 culture 	 s 	 	in	most	 socie 	 ties 	 	?
is	the	hijab	or	the	 head 	 scar 	 f 	 	a	symbol	of	 sub 	 mission 	 	or	 resist 	 ance 	 	?
when	so	 man 	 y 	 	women	and	 girl 	 s 	 	are	 beat 	 en 	 	,	 rap 	 ed 	 	,	 ma 	 im 	 ed 	 	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	in	the	name	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 cause 	 s 	 	--	honor	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	 national 	 ity 	 	--	what	 allow 	 s 	 	women	to	 re 	 plant 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	to	 re 	 build 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	to	lead	radical	,	non	-	violent	 move 	 ments 	 	for	social	change	?
is	it	different	women	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	and	the	 radical 	 izing 	 	?
or	are	they	one	and	the	same	?
are	we	 guilt 	 y 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	chimamanda	adichie	 re 	 minded 	 	us	at	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	in	oxford	,	of	 assum 	 ing 	 	that	there	is	a	single	story	of	women	's	 struggle 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	while	there	are	,	in	fact	,	 man 	 y 	 	?
and	what	,	if	 any 	 thing 	 	,	do	men	have	to	do	with	it	?
much	of	my	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	quest	to	get	some	 answer 	 s 	 	to	these	 question 	 s 	 	.
it	's	taken	me	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	and	 introduc 	 ed 	 	me	to	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	people	.
in	the	process	,	i	've	 gather 	 ed 	 	a	few	 fragment 	 s 	 	that	help	me	shed	some	light	on	 th 	 is 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
among	 t 	 hose 	 	who	've	 help 	 ed 	 	open	my	 eye 	 s 	 	to	a	third	way	are	:	a	 dev 	 out 	 	muslim	in	afghanistan	,	a	group	of	 harmon 	 izing 	 	 lesbian 	 s 	 	in	croatia	and	a	taboo	breaker	in	liberia	.
i	'm	indebted	to	them	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	am	to	my	 parent 	 s 	 	,	who	for	some	set	of	 mis 	 demeanor 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	last	life	,	 we 	 re 	 	 bless 	 ed 	 	with	three	 daughter 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
and	for	 reason 	 s 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	 un 	 clear 	 	to	me	,	seem	to	be	 in 	 ordin 	 ate 	 ly 	 	proud	of	the	three	of	us	.
i	was	born	and	raised	here	in	india	,	and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	an	early	age	to	be	 deep 	 ly 	 	suspicious	of	the	 aunt 	 ies 	 	and	 uncle 	 s 	 	who	would	bend	down	,	pat	us	on	the	head	and	then	say	to	my	 parent 	 s 	 	with	no	problem	at	all	,	``	poor	 thing 	 s 	 	.	you	 on 	 ly 	 	have	three	 daughter 	 s 	 	.
but	you	're	young	,	you	could	still	try	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
my	sense	of	 out 	 rage 	 	about	women	's	 right 	 s 	 	was	 br 	 ought 	 	to	a	boil	when	i	was	about	11	.
my	aunt	,	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	articulate	and	 brilli 	 ant 	 	woman	,	was	 widow 	 ed 	 	early	.
a	flock	of	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	 descend 	 ed 	 	on	her	.
they	took	off	her	 color 	 ful 	 	 s 	 ari 	 	.
they	made	her	wear	a	white	one	.
they	 wipe 	 d 	 	her	 bin 	 di 	 	off	her	 fore 	 head 	 	.
they	broke	her	 bang 	 les 	 	.
her	daughter	,	rani	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 old 	 er 	 	than	me	,	 s 	 at 	 	in	her	lap	 be 	 wild 	 er 	 ed 	 	,	not	 know 	 ing 	 	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	confident	woman	she	once	 k 	 new 	 	 a 	 s 	 	her	mother	.
late	that	night	,	i	heard	my	mother	 beg 	 ging 	 	my	father	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	 some 	 thing 	 	ramu	.	ca	n't	you	 inter 	 vene 	 	?	``
and	my	father	,	in	a	low	voice	,	 mut 	 tering 	 	,	``	i	'm	just	the	 young 	 est 	 	brother	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	i	can	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	tradition	.	``
that	's	the	night	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	about	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	female	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
women	do	n't	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	,	but	they	define	us	,	and	they	define	our	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	and	our	 chance 	 s 	 	.
and	men	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	too	.
my	father	,	who	had	 f 	 ought 	 	in	three	 war 	 s 	 	,	could	not	 s 	 ave 	 	his	own	sister	from	 th 	 is 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
by	18	,	under	the	 excel 	 lent 	 	 tu 	 tel 	 age 	 	of	my	mother	,	i	was	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	might	expect	,	 defi 	 ant 	 ly 	 	feminist	.
on	the	 street 	 s 	 	 chant 	 ing 	 	,	``	[	hindi	]	[	hindi	]	we	are	the	women	of	india	.
we	are	not	 flower 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 spark 	 s 	 	of	change	.	``
by	the	time	i	got	to	beijing	in	1995	,	it	was	clear	to	me	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	gender	 e 	 quality 	 	was	to	 over 	 turn 	 	centuries	of	 oppress 	 ive 	 	tradition	.
soon	after	i	 return 	 ed 	 	from	beijing	,	i	 leap 	 t 	 	at	the	chance	to	work	for	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	 found 	 ed 	 	by	women	,	to	support	women	's	 right 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
but	 bare 	 ly 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	new	job	,	i	met	a	woman	who	 force 	 d 	 	me	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	all	my	 assumption 	 s 	 	.
her	name	is	sakena	yacoobi	.
she	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	 off 	 ice 	 	at	a	time	when	no	one	 k 	 new 	 	where	afghanistan	was	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	it	is	not	about	the	 bur 	 ka 	 	.	``
she	was	the	most	 determine 	 d 	 	 advoc 	 ate 	 	for	women	's	 right 	 s 	 	i	had	ever	heard	.
she	told	me	women	 we 	 re 	 	running	 under 	 ground 	 	 school 	 s 	 	in	her	 commun 	 ities 	 	 in 	 side 	 	afghanistan	,	and	that	her	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	the	afghan	institute	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	had	 start 	 ed 	 	a	school	in	pakistan	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	first	thing	 any 	 one 	 	who	is	a	muslim	 know 	 s 	 	is	that	the	koran	 requir 	 es 	 	and	 strong 	 ly 	 	 support 	 s 	 	 liter 	 acy 	 	.

when	i	had	to	open	the	school	in	the	 refuge 	 e 	 	camp	,	i	went	to	see	the	imam	.
i	told	him	,	'	i	'm	a	 believ 	 er 	 	,	and	women	and	children	in	these	 terr 	 ible 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	need	 the 	 ir 	 	faith	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.	'	``	she	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	 s 	 ly 	 ly 	 	.

sakena	is	a	teacher	at	a	time	when	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	women	is	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	business	in	afghanistan	.

then	 thing 	 s 	 	get	tense	.
the	police	are	 call 	 ed 	 	in	to	 physical 	 ly 	 	 re 	 move 	 	the	women	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	senior	officer	 approach 	 es 	 	with	a	 ba 	 ton 	 	,	layma	 stand 	 s 	 	up	with	 de 	 liber 	 ation 	 	,	 reach 	 es 	 	her	 arm 	 s 	 	up	over	her	head	,	and	 begin 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	to	untie	her	 head 	 dress 	 	that	 cover 	 s 	 	her	hair	.
you	can	see	the	 police 	 man 	 	's	face	.
he	 look 	 s 	 	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	.	he	 back 	 s 	 	away	.
and	the	next	thing	you	know	,	the	police	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
layma	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	 lat 	 er 	 	,	``	it	's	a	taboo	,	you	know	,	in	west	africa	.
if	an	 old 	 er 	 	woman	 un 	 dress 	 es 	 	in	front	of	a	man	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 want 	 s 	 	to	,	the	man	's	family	is	 cur 	 s 	 ed 	 	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	if	he	did	it	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 believ 	 ed 	 	,	but	he	 k 	 new 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	not	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	not	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	peace	accord	was	 sign 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	the	peace	accord	was	 sign 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	women	of	liberia	then	 mobilize 	 d 	 	in	support	of	ellen	johnson	sirleaf	,	a	woman	who	broke	a	few	 taboo 	 s 	 	 her 	 self 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	the	first	 elect 	 ed 	 	woman	head	of	state	in	africa	in	 year 	 s 	 	.
when	she	made	her	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	address	,	she	 acknowledg 	 ed 	 	these	brave	women	of	liberia	who	 allow 	 ed 	 	her	to	win	against	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	star	--	that	's	soccer	for	you	americans	--	no	less	.
women	like	sakena	and	leah	and	layma	have	 humble 	 d 	 	me	and	 change 	 d 	 	me	and	made	me	 real 	 ize 	 	that	i	should	not	be	so	quick	to	jump	to	 assumption 	 s 	 	of	any	kind	.
they	've	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	me	from	my	righteous	anger	by	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	third	way	.
a	filipina	activist	once	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	how	do	you	cook	a	rice	cake	?
with	heat	from	the	bottom	and	heat	from	the	top	.	``
the	 protest 	 s 	 	,	the	 march 	 es 	 	,	the	 un 	 com 	 promising 	 	position	that	women	's	 right 	 s 	 	are	human	 right 	 s 	 	,	full	stop	.
that	's	the	heat	from	the	bottom	.
that	's	malcolm	x	and	the	 suff 	 rag 	 ists 	 	and	 ga 	 y 	 	 pri 	 de 	 	 para 	 de 	 s 	 	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	the	heat	from	the	top	.
and	in	most	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	that	top	is	still	controlled	by	men	.
so	to	 para 	 phrase 	 	marx	:	women	make	change	,	but	not	in	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 choos 	 ing 	 	.
they	have	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	.
they	have	to	 sub 	 vert 	 	tradition	that	once	 silence 	 d 	 	them	in	order	to	give	voice	to	new	 aspir 	 ations 	 	.
and	they	need	 al 	 lies 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
 al 	 lies 	 	like	the	imam	,	 al 	 lies 	 	like	the	father	who	now	 write 	 s 	 	 song 	 s 	 	for	a	lesbian	group	in	croatia	,	 al 	 lies 	 	like	the	 police 	 man 	 	who	 honor 	 ed 	 	a	taboo	and	 back 	 ed 	 	away	,	 al 	 lies 	 	like	my	father	,	who	could	n't	help	his	sister	but	 ha 	 s 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	three	 daughter 	 s 	 	pursue	 the 	 ir 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 femin 	 ism 	 	,	 un 	 like 	 	 al 	 most 	 	every	other	social	 move 	 ment 	 	,	is	not	a	struggle	against	a	distinct	 oppress 	 or 	 	--	it	's	not	the	 rul 	 ing 	 	class	or	the	 occupier 	 s 	 	or	the	 colon 	 izer 	 s 	 	--	it	's	against	a	 deep 	 ly 	 	held	set	of	 belief 	 s 	 	and	 assumption 	 s 	 	that	we	women	,	far	too	often	,	hold	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	ultimate	gift	of	 femin 	 ism 	 	,	that	the	personal	is	in	fact	the	 politic 	 al 	 	.
so	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	eleanor	roosevelt	 s 	 aid 	 	once	of	human	 right 	 s 	 	,	the	same	is	true	of	gender	 e 	 quality 	 	:	that	it	 start 	 s 	 	in	small	 place 	 s 	 	,	close	to	home	.
on	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	in	 negoti 	 ations 	 	at	the	kitchen	table	and	in	the	marital	bed	and	in	 relationship 	 s 	 	between	 lover 	 s 	 	and	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	and	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	by	 integ 	 rating 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	tradition	and	community	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 struggle 	 s 	 	,	women	like	sakena	and	leah	and	layma	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	women	like	sonia	gandhi	here	in	india	and	michelle	bachelet	in	chile	and	shirin	ebadi	in	iran	--	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
they	're	 challeng 	 ing 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	western	 model 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
they	are	 say 	 ing 	 	,	we	do	n't	have	to	be	like	you	to	make	change	.
we	can	wear	a	 s 	 ari 	 	or	a	hijab	or	pants	or	a	boubou	,	and	we	can	be	party	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	 pre 	 sidents 	 	and	human	 right 	 s 	 	 lawyer 	 s 	 	.
we	can	use	our	tradition	to	 navig 	 ate 	 	change	.
we	can	 de 	 militar 	 ize 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	and	pour	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 reservoir 	 s 	 	of	genuine	security	.
it	is	in	these	little	 st 	 ories 	 	,	these	individual	 st 	 ories 	 	,	that	i	see	a	radical	epic	 be 	 ing 	 	written	by	women	around	the	world	.
it	is	in	these	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 wove 	 n 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 resili 	 ent 	 	fabric	that	will	sustain	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	that	i	find	hope	.
and	if	my	heart	is	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	in	these	little	 fragment 	 s 	 	,	every	now	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	catch	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	a	whole	,	of	a	whole	new	world	.
and	she	is	 definite 	 ly 	 	on	her	way	.
thank	you	.
