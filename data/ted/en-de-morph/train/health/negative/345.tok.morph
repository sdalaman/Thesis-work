[	shit	]	 th 	 is 	 	is	 argu 	 ably 	 	the	back	end	of	the	design	of	 animal 	 s 	 	.
but	the	reason	i	put	 th 	 is 	 	up	here	is	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	was	in	africa	last	year	,	my	wife	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	around	,	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	guide	,	who	 show 	 ed 	 	us	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 surprise 	 d 	 	both	of	us	,	and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 reveal 	 ing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 fasci 	 nation 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	with	the	design	of	 animal 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	in	about	the	1880s	,	the	 mission 	 aries 	 	came	to	africa	to	spread	the	word	of	christianity	,	to	teach	english	to	the	 native 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 br 	 ought 	 	blackboards	and	chalk	.
and	i	'd	like	you	to	imagine	that	that	's	a	 black 	 board 	 	,	and	i	just	used	some	chalk	on	there	.
and	they	 br 	 ought 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
but	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	blackboards	 we 	 re 	 	fine	,	but	they	ran	out	of	chalk	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	crisis	for	them	.
and	that	's	where	the	hyena	 come 	 s 	 	in	.
the	hyena	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 perfect 	 ly 	 	designed	scavenging	animal	in	the	world	.
it	strip	-	 mine 	 s 	 	carcasses	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	the	hyena	to	 essential 	 ly 	 	eat	 bone 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	end	product	of	that	action	is	up	on	the	board	here	.
and	what	the	 mission 	 aries 	 	would	do	is	,	they	'd	walk	around	and	they	'd	pick	up	hyena	shit	.
and	the	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	about	hyena	shit	is	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	great	chalk	.
now	,	that	's	not	what	i	'm	here	to	talk	about	,	but	it	is	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	animal	design	.
what	i	'm	here	to	talk	about	is	the	camel	.
when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	richard	about	what	i	was	going	to	speak	about	,	i	had	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	come	back	from	jordan	,	where	i	had	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	experience	with	a	camel	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	desert	--	richard	wurman	:	that	's	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	!
keith	 bel 	 low 	 s 	 	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	desert	,	in	wadi	rum	,	in	a	small	jeep	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	four	of	us	--	two	bedouin	 driver 	 s 	 	--	and	you	can	just	imagine	,	 th 	 is 	 	expanse	is	an	ocean	of	sand	,	105	 degree 	 s 	 	,	one	water	bottle	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	in	what	they	told	us	was	 the 	 ir 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	best	jeep	.	did	n't	look	like	it	to	me	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	go	through	the	desert	,	the	jeep	broke	down	.
the	 guy 	 s 	 	got	out	,	they	put	the	hood	up	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	under	the	hood	,	got	it	going	 aga 	 in 	 	.	about	a	hundred	 yard 	 s 	 	,	it	broke	down	.
 th 	 is 	 	went	on	about	six	or	seven	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	more	and	more	 alarm 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 deep 	 er 	 	and	 deep 	 er 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	desert	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	our	worst	nightmare	 happen 	 ed 	 	:	they	 flood 	 ed 	 	the	engine	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ah	,	no	problem	!	we	just	get	out	and	walk	.	``
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	get	out	and	walk	?	``
one	water	bottle	--	remember	,	 guy 	 s 	 	--	four	people	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	'll	walk	.	we	'll	find	some	 camel 	 s 	 	.	``
so	we	got	out	and	 walk 	 ed 	 	,	and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	about	half	a	mile	,	we	came	over	the	crest	of	 th 	 is 	 	hill	,	and	there	was	a	huge	 gather 	 ing 	 	of	bedouin	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 camel 	 s 	 	.
the	guy	went	up	and	 start 	 ed 	 	dickering	,	and	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	had	four	 camel 	 s 	 	.
they	went	down	like	 elev 	 ators 	 	;	we	got	on	them	.	they	went	back	up	,	and	the	bedouin	--	each	bedouin	,	four	of	them	--	got	 be 	 hind 	 	each	of	the	 camel 	 s 	 	with	a	little	whip	.
and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	slashing	away	at	the	back	of	the	 camel 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 gall 	 op 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	you	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	on	a	camel	,	it	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	ride	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	one	other	 a 	 spect 	 	about	these	 camel 	 s 	 	.
about	every	10	 step 	 s 	 	,	they	lean	back	and	try	to	take	a	chunk	out	of	your	leg	.
so	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	going	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	camel	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	a	chunk	out	of	my	leg	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	three	 mile 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	our	destination	,	where	a	jeep	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	meet	us	.
and	the	 camel 	 s 	 	come	down	 aga 	 in 	 	like	 elev 	 ators 	 	,	we	sort	of	 clumsi 	 ly 	 	get	off	,	and	they	--	 obvious 	 ly 	 	--	try	to	take	 an 	 other 	 	chunk	out	of	my	leg	.
and	i	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	relationship	with	 th 	 is 	 	creature	by	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	and	i	've	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	mean	son	of	a	bitch	.
and	much	meaner	,	by	the	way	,	than	the	bedouin	who	 greet 	 ed 	 	me	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	sell	me	one	of	his	26	 daughter 	 s 	 	to	take	back	to	the	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	,	richard	and	i	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	should	 br 	 ing 	 	a	camel	.
i	think	the	camel	is	the	best	designed	animal	in	the	world	.	``
and	he	kind	of	went	,	``	 na 	 h 	 	.	i	do	n't	think	we	want	to	be	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	a	camel	.	``
and	you	should	be	 re 	 ally 	 	glad	we	 decide 	 d 	 	not	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	camel	.
so	i	did	the	next	best	thing	.
i	went	to	the	washington	zoo	.	richard	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	you	to	get	up	close	and	personal	with	 th 	 is 	 	camel	.
i	want	you	to	inspect	 it 	 s 	 	mouth	,	look	at	 it 	 s 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	.
go	 under 	 neath 	 	it	.	go	above	it	.	go	around	it	.
pull	 it 	 s 	 	tail	up	;	take	a	look	in	there	.
i	want	you	to	get	 a 	 s 	 	close	to	that	camel	 a 	 s 	 	you	possibly	can	.	``
so	,	i	got	a	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	film	crew	.	we	went	down	there	,	and	i	took	one	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	camel	.
it	is	a	2,000	pound	creature	who	is	in	rut	.
now	,	if	you	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	a	2,000	pound	camel	in	a	rut	,	it	is	a	 scar 	 y 	 	,	 scar 	 y 	 	thing	to	 be 	 hold 	 	.
and	if	richard	thought	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	in	the	ring	with	that	camel	,	 some 	 one 	 	was	 smok 	 ing 	 	bedouin	high	grade	.
so	we	got	 a 	 s 	 	close	to	it	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	and	i	'm	going	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	--	chris	,	if	you	want	to	roll	 th 	 is 	 	film	--	and	then	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	little	bit	more	about	the	design	of	 camel 	 s 	 	.
do	you	want	to	roll	the	film	?
 hell 	 o 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	keith	 bel 	 low 	 s 	 	with	the	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	camel	investigation	unit	.
i	'm	here	to	look	at	the	ultimate	desert	machine	.
and	you	'll	note	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 chew 	 ing 	 	gum	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	around	 th 	 is 	 	camel	all	day	.
senior	keeper	:	that	's	it	,	that	's	it	,	ok	.	no	!	see	,	now	he	's	 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	overexcited	.
so	we	'll	need	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	around	him	.	do	n't	let	him	get	you	.
now	,	you	can	see	 cop 	 ious 	 	 amount 	 s 	 	of	saliva	in	there	.	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	i	call	 my 	 self 	 	the	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	 s 	 table 	 	boy	.
 the 	 ir 	 	nose	--	you	can	see	his	nose	is	 flare 	 d 	 	right	now	.
when	they	're	in	rut	--	they	're	similar	to	 seal 	 s 	 	in	the	way	,	like	,	a	seal	 ha 	 s 	 	to	open	 it 	 s 	 	nose	to	breathe	.
and	they	're	similar	.	they	have	to	kind	of	 conscious 	 ly 	 	open	 the 	 ir 	 	nose	.
 ear 	 s 	 	?	they	are	small	.	but	they	have	 excel 	 lent 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
but	not	a	big	--	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	 zebra 	 s 	 	,	they	have	a	huge	ear	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	mobile	,	so	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	turn	them	both	around	.
and	they	use	them	in	the	same	way	we	use	our	binocular	vision	.
they	use	them	to	 pin 	 point 	 	sound	.
the	desert	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 wind 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	.
so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	they	have	the	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 eye 	 lash 	 es 	 	,	but	there	's	the	 second 	 ary 	 	--	i	guess	you	'd	call	it	the	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	hair	that	's	above	the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	 be 	 low 	 	it	it	's	 long 	 er 	 	.
most	people	think	that	the	humps	store	water	.
they	do	n't	.	they	store	fat	.
but	--	now	,	i	'm	not	a	chemist	,	but	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	the	fat	is	oxidized	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 breath 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	will	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 us 	 able 	 	water	.
like	a	lot	of	 predator 	 s 	 	,	they	walk	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 to 	 es 	 	.
but	there	's	a	big	,	fat	pad	in	there	that	squishes	out	.
they	're	like	 s 	 un 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	but	,	you	know	,	with	sand	.
 hoo 	 ves 	 	?	they	do	n't	have	 tradition 	 al 	 	 hoo 	 ves 	 	,	but	they	do	have	one	,	like	,	big	nail	.
you	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	see	too	clear	.	the	fur	's	kind	of	grown	over	.
but	they	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 tail 	 s 	 	a	lot	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	rut	.
he	will	 urin 	 ate 	 	and	spin	his	tail	to	spread	the	 urin 	 e 	 	around	and	make	him	more	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	why	that	would	be	,	but	it	 work 	 s 	 	for	them	.
so	,	what	the	hell	.
now	,	they	will	 al 	 so 	 	defecate	in	certain	 area 	 s 	 	.
 general 	 ly 	 	,	they	poop	 where 	 ver 	 	they	want	to	,	but	 dur 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	rut	,	they	will	defecate	in	 peri 	 meter 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	've	read	or	heard	about	the	sub	-	sonic	 sound 	 s 	 	from	 elephant 	 s 	 	--	you	know	what	i	mean	,	like	,	``	br	-	r	-	r	!	``
these	big	,	big	rumbling	 sound 	 s 	 	.	he	will	do	the	same	thing	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	,	right	here	,	it	will	 vib 	 rate 	 	.
we	weigh	our	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	he	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	animal	,	so	he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	 scale 	 s 	 	.
we	had	these	big	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	weigh	the	 bi 	 son 	 	on	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	.
i	'm	 guess 	 ing 	 	that	he	--	well	,	he	's	at	 l 	 east 	 	1,600	 pound 	 s 	 	.
but	i	would	put	him	 close 	 r 	 	to	2,000	.
he	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 walk 	 ing 	 	mulch	pile	.
we	're	kind	of	like	 bud 	 s 	 	,	but	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	a	male	 a 	 s 	 	well	and	he	's	--	kb	:	he	 s 	 ees 	 	you	 a 	 s 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	?	senior	keeper	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	 make 	 s 	 	him	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	of	year	.
do	n't	even	think	about	it	.	do	n't	think	about	it	!
but	now	,	we	're	going	to	meet	--	out	!	out	!
out	!
no	.

kb	:	what	i	did	n't	show	you	was	--	you	got	that	 s 	 wing 	 ing 	 	thing	going	?
well	--	and	you	're	glad	i	did	n't	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	camel	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	design	is	that	 it 	 s 	 	penis	 point 	 s 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
that	way	the	camel	can	dip	 it 	 s 	 	tail	in	the	stream	,	and	just	whacker	the	entire	area	around	him	.
and	that	's	how	he	 re 	 ally 	 	 mark 	 s 	 	his	 territ 	 ory 	 	.
now	,	what	you	 al 	 so 	 	did	n't	see	was	that	--	and	you	may	have	 notice 	 d 	 	in	the	pen	 be 	 side 	 	him	and	,	by	the	way	,	the	camel	's	name	is	suki	.
in	the	pen	 be 	 side 	 	him	is	 ja 	 s 	 mine 	 	.
 ja 	 s 	 mine 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	his	mate	for	some	time	.
but	on	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	occasion	,	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	that	 a 	 s 	 	horny	 a 	 s 	 	suki	was	,	 ja 	 s 	 mine 	 	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	it	.
and	so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
well	,	if	poor	old	suki	is	in	search	of	a	mate	,	what	would	suki	do	to	find	the	perfect	mate	?
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	 an 	 other 	 	film	.
but	before	i	do	,	i	just	want	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	animal	 tru 	 ly 	 	is	a	sort	of	the	suv	of	the	sand	,	the	ship	of	the	desert	.	it	's	so	vital	to	the	 inhabit 	 ants 	 	of	the	 area 	 s 	 	in	which	the	camel	is	found	--	 large 	 ly 	 	mongolia	and	sahara	--	that	there	are	160	 word 	 s 	 	in	arabic	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	camel	.
and	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	creature	that	was	designed	by	 commit 	 tee 	 	,	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	like	no	 commit 	 tee 	 	i	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	on	.
