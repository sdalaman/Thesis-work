what	i	'm	going	to	try	and	do	in	the	next	15	 minute 	 s 	 	or	so	is	tell	you	about	an	idea	of	how	we	're	going	to	make	matter	come	 al 	 ive 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	may	seem	a	bit	 ambit 	 ious 	 	,	but	when	you	look	at	 your 	 self 	 	,	you	look	at	your	 hand 	 s 	 	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	you	're	 al 	 ive 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	start	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	quest	 start 	 ed 	 	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	on	planet	earth	.
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	 bio 	 logical 	 	life	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	chemist	,	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	make	 th 	 is 	 	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	living	world	and	the	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	dead	world	.
and	what	i	'm	going	to	try	and	do	is	plant	some	 idea 	 s 	 	about	how	we	can	transform	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	dead	matter	 in 	 to 	 	living	matter	,	 in 	 to 	 	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	biology	.
before	we	do	that	,	i	want	to	kind	of	put	biology	in	 it 	 s 	 	place	.
and	i	'm	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 enthrall 	 ed 	 	by	biology	.
i	love	to	do	synthetic	biology	.
i	love	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ive 	 	.
i	love	 manipul 	 ating 	 	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	of	biology	.
but	 with 	 in 	 	that	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	we	have	to	remember	that	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	force	of	biology	is	 re 	 ally 	 	coming	from	evolution	.
and	evolution	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	 establish 	 ed 	 	well	over	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	by	charles	darwin	and	a	vast	number	of	other	people	,	evolution	still	is	a	little	bit	 in 	 tangible 	 	.
and	when	i	talk	about	darwinian	evolution	,	i	mean	one	thing	and	one	thing	 on 	 ly 	 	,	and	that	is	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	the	 fit 	 test 	 	.
and	so	forget	about	evolution	in	a	kind	of	 meta 	 physical 	 	way	.
think	about	evolution	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 off 	 spring 	 	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	,	and	some	winning	.
so	 bear 	 ing 	 	that	in	mind	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	chemist	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	the	question	 frust 	 rated 	 	by	biology	:	what	is	the	minimal	unit	of	matter	that	can	 under 	 go 	 	darwinian	evolution	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	question	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	chemist	,	we	're	not	used	to	 pro 	 found 	 	 question 	 s 	 	every	day	.
so	when	i	thought	about	it	,	then	 sudden 	 ly 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	biology	 g 	 ave 	 	us	the	answer	.
and	in	fact	,	the	 small 	 est 	 	unit	of	matter	that	can	evolve	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	is	,	in	fact	,	a	single	cell	--	a	bacteria	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 raise 	 s 	 	three	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 question 	 s 	 	:	what	is	life	?
is	biology	special	?
 biologist 	 s 	 	seem	to	think	so	.
is	matter	evolvable	?
now	if	we	answer	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	in	reverse	order	,	the	third	question	--	is	matter	evolvable	?	--	if	we	can	answer	that	,	then	we	're	going	to	know	how	special	biology	is	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	,	just	 may 	 be 	 	,	we	'll	have	some	idea	of	what	life	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
so	here	's	some	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dead	crystal	,	and	i	'm	going	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	to	it	,	and	it	's	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	you	can	see	,	it	's	kind	of	 pollinat 	 ing 	 	,	 germ 	 in 	 ating 	 	,	growing	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	tube	.
and	all	these	 crystal 	 s 	 	here	under	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	 we 	 re 	 	dead	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	they	look	 al 	 ive 	 	.
of	course	,	they	're	not	 al 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	a	 chemist 	 ry 	 	experiment	where	i	've	made	a	crystal	garden	.
but	when	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	 life 	 like 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	pause	for	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	,	have	a	look	at	the	screen	.
you	can	see	there	's	 architect 	 ure 	 	growing	,	 fill 	 ing 	 	the	void	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	dead	.
so	i	was	positive	that	,	if	 some 	 how 	 	we	can	make	 thing 	 s 	 	mimic	life	,	let	's	go	one	step	further	.
let	's	see	if	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	life	.
but	there	's	a	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	up	 un 	 til 	 	 may 	 be 	 	a	decade	ago	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	told	that	life	was	 im 	 possible 	 	and	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	the	most	 in 	 credible 	 	miracle	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
now	,	that	's	a	bit	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	chemist	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	``	hang	on	.	what	is	going	on	here	?
is	life	that	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	?	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	question	.
i	think	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	emergence	of	the	first	 cell 	 s 	 	was	 a 	 s 	 	 prob 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	emergence	of	the	 star 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	let	's	take	that	one	step	further	.
let	's	say	that	if	the	physics	of	fusion	is	 encode 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	physics	of	life	is	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	so	the	problem	with	 chemist 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	massive	advantage	 a 	 s 	 	well	--	is	we	like	to	focus	on	our	 element 	 s 	 	.
in	biology	,	carbon	 take 	 s 	 	center	stage	.
and	in	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	where	carbon	 exist 	 s 	 	and	 organ 	 ic 	 	biology	,	then	we	have	all	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	life	.
in	fact	,	we	have	 s 	 uch 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 life 	 form 	 s 	 	that	we	can	 manipul 	 ate 	 	.
we	're	 awful 	 ly 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	in	the	lab	to	try	and	avoid	 vari 	 ous 	 	biohazards	.
well	what	about	matter	?
if	we	can	make	matter	 al 	 ive 	 	,	would	we	have	a	matterhazard	?
so	think	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	serious	question	.
if	your	pen	could	replicate	,	that	would	be	a	bit	of	a	problem	.
so	we	have	to	think	 different 	 ly 	 	if	we	're	going	to	make	stuff	come	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	be	aware	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	.
but	before	we	can	make	life	,	let	's	think	for	a	second	what	life	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 character 	 ized 	 	by	.
and	forgive	the	 complic 	 ated 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 path 	 ways 	 	in	the	cell	.
and	the	cell	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	for	us	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	thing	.
synthetic	 biologist 	 s 	 	are	 manipul 	 ating 	 	it	.
 chemist 	 s 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	to	look	at	disease	.
and	you	have	all	these	 path 	 ways 	 	going	on	at	the	same	time	.
you	have	 regulat 	 ion 	 	;	information	is	 tran 	 scribed 	 	;	 catalyst 	 s 	 	are	made	;	stuff	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
but	what	 do 	 es 	 	a	cell	do	?
well	it	 divide 	 s 	 	,	it	 compete 	 s 	 	,	it	 surviv 	 es 	 	.
and	i	think	that	is	where	we	have	to	start	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	building	from	our	 idea 	 s 	 	in	life	.
but	what	else	is	life	 character 	 ized 	 	by	?
well	,	i	like	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	flame	in	a	bottle	.
and	so	what	we	have	here	is	a	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	single	 cell 	 s 	 	 replica 	 ting 	 	,	 metabol 	 izing 	 	,	 burn 	 ing 	 	through	 chemist 	 ries 	 	.
and	so	we	have	to	understand	that	if	we	're	going	to	make	artificial	life	or	understand	the	origin	of	life	,	we	need	to	power	it	 some 	 how 	 	.
so	before	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	start	to	make	life	,	we	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	where	it	came	from	.
and	darwin	 him 	 self 	 	mused	in	a	letter	to	a	 col 	 league 	 	that	he	thought	that	life	 prob 	 ably 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	some	warm	little	pond	 some 	 where 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	not	in	scotland	,	 may 	 be 	 	in	africa	,	 may 	 be 	 	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
but	the	real	honest	answer	is	,	we	just	do	n't	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	a	problem	with	the	origin	.
imagine	way	back	,	four	and	a	half	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	is	a	vast	chemical	soup	of	stuff	.
and	from	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	we	came	.
so	when	you	think	about	the	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	nature	of	what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	in	the	next	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	just	remember	,	we	came	from	stuff	on	planet	earth	.
and	we	went	through	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 world 	 s 	 	.
the	rna	people	would	talk	about	the	rna	world	.
we	 some 	 how 	 	got	to	 protein 	 s 	 	and	dna	.
we	then	got	to	the	last	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	.
evolution	 kick 	 ed 	 	in	--	and	that	's	the	cool	bit	.
and	here	we	are	.
but	there	's	a	 road 	 block 	 	that	you	ca	n't	get	past	.
you	can	decode	the	genome	,	you	can	look	back	,	you	can	link	us	all	together	by	a	 mitochondria 	 l 	 	dna	,	but	we	ca	n't	get	further	than	the	last	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	,	the	last	visible	cell	that	we	could	sequence	or	think	back	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
so	we	do	n't	know	how	we	got	here	.
so	there	are	two	 option 	 s 	 	:	intelligent	design	,	direct	and	 in 	 direct 	 	--	so	god	,	or	my	friend	.
now	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	e.t	.	 put 	 ting 	 	us	there	,	or	some	other	life	,	just	 push 	 es 	 	the	problem	further	on	.
i	'm	not	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	,	i	'm	a	scientist	.
the	other	thing	we	need	to	think	about	is	the	emergence	of	chemical	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	most	 like 	 ly 	 	.
so	we	have	some	kind	of	primordial	soup	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	a	good	source	of	all	20	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 how 	 	these	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	are	 combine 	 d 	 	,	and	life	 begin 	 s 	 	.
but	life	 begin 	 s 	 	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
what	is	life	?	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	of	life	?
so	in	the	1950s	,	miller	-	urey	did	 the 	 ir 	 	fantastic	chemical	frankenstein	experiment	,	where	they	did	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	in	the	chemical	world	.
they	took	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	put	them	in	a	single	jar	and	ignited	them	and	put	a	lot	of	 volt 	 age 	 	through	.
and	they	had	a	look	at	what	was	in	the	soup	,	and	they	found	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	came	out	,	there	was	no	cell	.
so	the	whole	area	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	for	a	while	,	and	it	got	 re 	 ignit 	 ed 	 	in	the	'80s	when	 analytic 	 al 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	computer	 techno 	 logies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	on	.
in	my	own	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	the	way	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	life	is	by	using	 man 	 y 	 	different	 re 	 action 	 	 format 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	do	 react 	 ions 	 	--	not	in	one	flask	,	but	in	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 flask 	 s 	 	,	and	connect	them	together	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	with	 th 	 is 	 	flow	system	,	all	these	 pipe 	 s 	 	.
we	can	do	it	microfluidically	,	we	can	do	it	lithographically	,	we	can	do	it	in	a	3d	 print 	 er 	 	,	we	can	do	it	in	 drop 	 lets 	 	for	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
and	the	key	thing	is	to	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	complex	 chemist 	 ry 	 	just	 bubb 	 ling 	 	away	.
but	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	end	in	failure	,	so	we	need	to	be	a	bit	more	focused	.
and	the	answer	,	of	course	,	lies	with	 mic 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	i	remember	what	i	need	 a 	 s 	 	a	chemist	.
i	say	,	``	well	i	want	 molecule 	 s 	 	.	``
but	i	need	a	 metabol 	 ism 	 	,	i	need	some	energy	.
i	need	some	information	,	and	i	need	a	 contain 	 er 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	i	want	evolution	,	i	need	 contain 	 ers 	 	to	compete	.
so	if	you	have	a	 contain 	 er 	 	,	it	's	like	 get 	 ting 	 	in	your	car	.
``	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	car	,	and	i	'm	going	to	drive	around	and	show	off	my	car	.	``
and	i	imagine	you	have	a	similar	thing	in	cellular	biology	with	the	emergence	of	life	.
so	these	 thing 	 s 	 	together	give	us	evolution	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	.
and	the	way	to	test	it	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	is	to	make	it	minimal	.
so	what	we	're	going	to	try	and	do	is	come	up	with	an	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	lego	kit	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
and	so	forgive	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	,	but	these	are	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	kit	.
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 may 	 be 	 	three	or	four	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	building	 block 	 s 	 	present	.
and	we	can	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	them	together	and	make	 liter 	 ally 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	big	nano	-	 mole 	 cular 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	of	dna	and	 protein 	 s 	 	,	but	there	's	no	carbon	in	sight	.
carbon	is	 bann 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	with	 th 	 is 	 	lego	kit	,	we	have	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	for	complex	information	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	 with 	 out 	 	dna	.
but	we	need	to	make	some	 contain 	 ers 	 	.
and	just	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	in	my	lab	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	take	these	 ver 	 y 	 	same	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	make	 cell 	 s 	 	with	them	.
and	you	can	see	on	the	screen	a	cell	 be 	 ing 	 	made	.
and	we	're	now	going	to	put	some	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 in 	 side 	 	and	do	some	 chemist 	 ry 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	cell	.
and	all	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	is	we	can	set	up	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	 membrane 	 s 	 	,	in	real	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	then	it	 set 	 s 	 	up	a	kind	of	 mole 	 cular 	 	darwinism	,	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	the	 fit 	 test 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	movie	here	 show 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	between	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
 molecule 	 s 	 	are	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	for	stuff	.
they	're	all	made	of	the	same	stuff	,	but	they	want	 the 	 ir 	 	shape	to	win	.
they	want	 the 	 ir 	 	shape	to	persist	.
and	that	is	the	key	.
if	we	can	 some 	 how 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	to	talk	to	each	other	and	make	the	right	 shape 	 s 	 	and	compete	,	they	will	start	to	form	 cell 	 s 	 	that	will	replicate	and	compete	.
if	we	manage	to	do	that	,	forget	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	detail	.
let	's	zoom	out	to	what	that	could	mean	.
so	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	special	 theor 	 y 	 	of	evolution	that	 appli 	 es 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	to	 organ 	 ic 	 	biology	,	to	us	.
if	we	could	get	evolution	 in 	 to 	 	the	material	world	,	then	i	 pro 	 pose 	 	we	should	have	a	general	 theor 	 y 	 	of	evolution	.
and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	worth	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
 do 	 es 	 	evolution	control	the	 sophistic 	 ation 	 	of	matter	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	?
is	there	some	 driv 	 ing 	 	force	through	evolution	that	 allow 	 s 	 	matter	to	compete	?
so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	could	then	start	to	develop	different	 platform 	 s 	 	for	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	evolution	.
so	you	imagine	,	if	we	're	able	to	create	a	self	-	 sustain 	 ing 	 	artificial	life	form	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	will	 th 	 is 	 	tell	us	about	the	origin	of	life	--	that	it	's	possible	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	carbon	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	;	it	can	use	 any 	 thing 	 	--	we	can	then	take	[	it	]	one	step	further	and	develop	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	then	use	 soft 	 ware 	 	control	for	evolution	to	code	in	.
so	imagine	we	make	a	little	cell	.
we	want	to	put	it	out	in	the	environment	,	and	we	want	it	to	be	powered	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
what	we	do	is	we	evolve	it	in	a	box	with	a	light	on	.
and	we	do	n't	use	design	 any 	 more 	 	.	we	find	what	 work 	 s 	 	.
we	should	take	our	inspiration	from	biology	.
biology	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	about	the	design	 un 	 less 	 	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	will	 re 	 organize 	 	the	way	we	design	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	not	 on 	 ly 	 	just	that	,	we	will	start	to	think	about	how	we	can	start	to	develop	a	 sym 	 biotic 	 	relationship	with	biology	.
would	n't	it	be	great	if	you	could	take	these	artificial	 bio 	 logical 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	and	fuse	them	with	 bio 	 logical 	 	 one 	 s 	 	to	correct	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	deal	with	?
the	real	issue	in	cellular	biology	is	we	are	never	going	to	understand	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	 multi 	 dimensional 	 	problem	put	there	by	evolution	.
evolution	can	not	be	cut	 a 	 part 	 	.
you	need	to	 some 	 how 	 	find	the	 fit 	 ness 	 	function	.
and	the	 pro 	 found 	 	 real 	 ization 	 	for	me	is	that	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	the	 self 	 ish 	 	gene	 get 	 s 	 	 kick 	 ed 	 	up	a	level	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 self 	 ish 	 	matter	.
and	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	in	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	where	we	are	right	now	the	highest	form	of	stuff	?
you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	 chair 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 in 	 animate 	 	,	they	're	not	 al 	 ive 	 	.
but	you	are	made	of	stuff	,	and	you	are	using	stuff	,	and	you	enslave	stuff	.
so	using	evolution	in	biology	,	and	in	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	biology	,	for	me	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 appeal 	 ing 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	key	 step 	 s 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	dead	stuff	come	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	when	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	remember	,	five	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	not	here	,	and	there	was	no	life	.
so	what	will	that	tell	us	about	the	origin	of	life	and	the	meaning	of	life	?
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	for	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	chemist	,	i	want	to	keep	away	from	general	 term 	 s 	 	;	i	want	to	think	about	 specific 	 s 	 	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	about	 defi 	 ning 	 	life	?
we	 re 	 ally 	 	struggle	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	think	,	if	we	can	make	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	biology	,	and	we	can	make	matter	 be 	 come 	 	evolvable	,	that	will	in	fact	define	life	.
i	 pro 	 pose 	 	to	you	that	matter	that	can	evolve	is	 al 	 ive 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	idea	of	making	evolvable	matter	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	just	a	quick	question	on	 time 	 line 	 	.
you	 believ 	 e 	 	you	're	going	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	?
when	?
lee	cronin	:	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	that	life	took	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	to	kick	in	.
we	're	 pro 	 posing 	 	to	do	it	in	just	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	,	once	we	've	set	up	the	right	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
ca	:	and	when	do	you	think	that	will	happen	?
lc	:	 hope 	 fully 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	that	would	be	a	big	story	.
in	your	own	mind	,	what	do	you	 believ 	 e 	 	the	 chance 	 s 	 	are	that	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	on	some	other	planet	is	non	-	carbon	-	based	life	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	or	 ooz 	 ing 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	?
lc	:	i	think	it	's	100	percent	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	thing	is	,	we	are	so	chauvinistic	to	biology	,	if	you	take	away	carbon	,	there	's	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	happen	.
so	the	other	thing	that	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	create	life	that	's	not	based	on	carbon	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	tell	nasa	what	 re 	 ally 	 	to	look	for	.
do	n't	go	and	look	for	carbon	,	go	and	look	for	evolvable	stuff	.
ca	:	lee	cronin	,	good	luck	.
