i	'm	a	 film 	 maker 	 	.
for	the	last	8	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	have	 dedicate 	 d 	 	my	life	to	 document 	 ing 	 	the	work	of	israelis	and	palestinians	who	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	end	the	conflict	using	 peace 	 ful 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
when	i	travel	with	my	work	 a 	 cross 	 	europe	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	one	question	 al 	 ways 	 	 come 	 s 	 	up	:	where	is	the	palestinian	gandhi	?
why	are	n't	palestinians	using	 non 	 violent 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	?
the	 challeng 	 e 	 	i	face	when	i	hear	 th 	 is 	 	question	is	that	often	i	have	just	 return 	 ed 	 	from	the	middle	east	where	i	 s 	 pent 	 	my	time	 film 	 ing 	 	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	palestinians	who	are	using	 non 	 violence 	 	to	defend	 the 	 ir 	 	 land 	 s 	 	and	water	 resource 	 s 	 	from	israeli	 soldier 	 s 	 	and	 settl 	 ers 	 	.
these	 lead 	 ers 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 for 	 ge 	 	a	massive	national	 non 	 violent 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	to	end	the	occupation	and	build	peace	in	the	region	.
yet	,	most	of	you	have	 prob 	 ably 	 	never	heard	about	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	divide	between	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	ground	and	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	 a 	 broad 	 	is	one	of	the	key	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	do	n't	have	yet	a	palestinian	 peace 	 ful 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
so	i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	talk	about	the	power	of	attention	,	the	power	of	your	attention	,	and	the	emergence	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 non 	 violent 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	in	the	west	bank	,	gaza	and	 else 	 where 	 	--	but	 to 	 day 	 	,	my	case	 stud 	 y 	 	is	going	to	be	palestine	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	what	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	for	 non 	 violence 	 	to	grow	is	not	for	palestinians	to	start	 adopt 	 ing 	 	 non 	 violence 	 	,	but	for	us	to	start	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 al 	 ready 	 	are	.
allow	me	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	point	by	taking	you	to	 th 	 is 	 	village	 call 	 ed 	 	budrus	.
about	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	they	 face 	 d 	 	 extinct 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	israel	 announce 	 d 	 	it	would	build	a	 separat 	 ion 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 	,	and	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 	would	be	built	on	top	of	the	village	.
they	would	lose	40	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	land	and	be	 surround 	 ed 	 	,	so	they	would	lose	free	access	to	the	rest	of	the	west	bank	.
through	inspired	local	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	they	 launch 	 ed 	 	a	 peace 	 ful 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	campaign	to	stop	that	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
let	me	show	you	some	brief	 clip 	 s 	 	,	so	you	have	a	sense	for	what	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	on	the	ground	.
palestinian	woman	:	we	 we 	 re 	 	told	the	wall	would	 separat 	 e 	 	palestine	from	israel	.
here	in	budrus	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	the	wall	would	steal	our	land	.
israeli	man	:	the	 f 	 ence 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	,	in	fact	,	 create 	 d 	 	a	solution	to	terror	.
man	:	 to 	 day 	 	you	're	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	a	 peace 	 ful 	 	march	.
you	are	 join 	 ed 	 	by	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	your	israeli	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	.
israeli	activist	:	 noth 	 ing 	 	 s 	 care 	 s 	 	the	 arm 	 y 	 	more	than	 non 	 violent 	 	 op 	 position 	 	.
woman	:	we	saw	the	men	 try 	 ing 	 	to	push	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	but	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	could	do	that	.
but	i	think	the	 girl 	 s 	 	could	do	it	.
fatah	party	member	:	we	must	empty	our	 mind 	 s 	 	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
hamas	party	member	:	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	complete	 harmon 	 y 	 	,	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	spread	it	to	all	of	palestine	.
 chant 	 ing 	 	:	one	 unit 	 ed 	 	nation	.
fatah	,	hamas	and	the	popular	front	!
news	anchor	:	the	 cl 	 ashes 	 	over	the	 f 	 ence 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	.
 report 	 er 	 	:	israeli	border	police	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	to	 dispers 	 e 	 	the	crowd	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	use	any	force	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
man	:	these	are	live	 bullet 	 s 	 	.
it	's	like	fallujah	.	 shoot 	 ing 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
israeli	activist	:	i	was	 s 	 ure 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	going	to	die	.
but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 other 	 s 	 	around	me	who	 we 	 re 	 	n't	even	 cow 	 er 	 ing 	 	.
israeli	soldier	:	a	 non 	 violent 	 	protest	is	not	going	to	stop	the	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.
protester	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 peace 	 ful 	 	march	.
there	is	no	need	to	use	violence	.
 chant 	 ing 	 	:	we	can	do	it	!	we	can	do	it	!
we	can	do	it	!
julia	bacha	:	when	i	first	heard	about	the	story	of	budrus	,	i	was	 surprise 	 d 	 	that	the	 inter 	 national 	 	media	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	cover	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	set	of	 event 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	2003	.
what	was	even	more	surprising	was	the	fact	that	budrus	was	 success 	 ful 	 	.
the	 resident 	 s 	 	,	after	10	 month 	 s 	 	of	 peace 	 ful 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	,	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	the	israeli	government	to	move	the	route	of	the	 bar 	 rier 	 	off	 the 	 ir 	 	 land 	 s 	 	and	to	the	green	line	,	which	is	the	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 bound 	 ary 	 	between	israel	and	the	palestinian	 territ 	 ories 	 	.
the	 resist 	 ance 	 	in	budrus	 ha 	 s 	 	since	spread	to	 village 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	west	bank	and	to	palestinian	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	in	jerusalem	.
yet	the	media	 remain 	 s 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	silent	on	these	 st 	 ories 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	silence	 car 	 ries 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	for	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	that	 non 	 violence 	 	can	grow	,	or	even	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	in	palestine	.
violent	 resist 	 ance 	 	and	 non 	 violent 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	share	one	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	in	common	;	they	are	both	a	form	of	theater	seeking	an	audience	to	 the 	 ir 	 	cause	.
if	violent	 act 	 ors 	 	are	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	front	-	page	 cover 	 s 	 	and	 attract 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	attention	to	the	palestinian	issue	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	for	 non 	 violent 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	to	make	the	case	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	that	civil	 dis 	 obedi 	 ence 	 	is	a	 vi 	 able 	 	option	in	 address 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 p 	 light 	 	.
the	power	of	attention	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	come	 a 	 s 	 	no	surprise	to	the	 parent 	 s 	 	in	the	room	.
the	 sur 	 est 	 	way	to	make	your	child	throw	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 loud 	 er 	 	 tantrum 	 s 	 	is	by	giving	him	attention	the	first	time	he	 throw 	 s 	 	a	fit	.
the	tantrum	will	 be 	 come 	 	what	 child 	 hood 	 	 psycho 	 logists 	 	call	a	functional	behavior	,	since	the	child	 ha 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	he	can	get	 parent 	 al 	 	attention	out	of	it	.
 parent 	 s 	 	can	incentivize	or	 dis 	 incentivize 	 	behavior	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	giving	or	 withdraw 	 ing 	 	attention	to	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
but	that	's	true	for	 adult 	 s 	 	too	.
in	fact	,	the	behavior	of	entire	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	 count 	 ries 	 	can	be	 influence 	 d 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	where	the	 inter 	 national 	 	community	 choos 	 es 	 	to	focus	 it 	 s 	 	attention	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	at	the	core	of	 end 	 ing 	 	the	conflict	in	the	middle	east	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	peace	is	for	us	to	transform	 non 	 violence 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	functional	behavior	by	giving	a	lot	more	attention	to	the	 non 	 violent 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	on	the	ground	 to 	 day 	 	.
in	the	course	of	taking	my	film	to	 village 	 s 	 	in	the	west	bank	,	in	gaza	and	in	east	jerusalem	,	i	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	impact	that	even	one	 document 	 ary 	 	film	can	have	in	 in 	 flu 	 encing 	 	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
in	a	village	 call 	 ed 	 	wallajeh	,	which	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	jerusalem	,	the	community	was	facing	a	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 p 	 light 	 	to	budrus	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	 surround 	 ed 	 	,	lose	a	lot	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 land 	 s 	 	and	not	have	 free 	 dom 	 	of	access	,	either	to	the	west	bank	or	jerusalem	.
they	had	 be 	 en 	 	using	 non 	 violence 	 	for	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	but	had	grown	 dis 	 enchant 	 ed 	 	since	 no 	 body 	 	was	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	.
so	we	 organize 	 d 	 	a	 screen 	 ing 	 	.
a	week	 lat 	 er 	 	,	they	held	the	most	well	-	 attend 	 ed 	 	and	 discipline 	 d 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 	to	date	.
the	 organize 	 rs 	 	say	that	the	 village 	 rs 	 	,	 up 	 on 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	the	story	of	budrus	 document 	 ed 	 	in	a	film	,	felt	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	people	 follow 	 ing 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	people	 car 	 ed 	 	.
so	they	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	going	.
on	the	israeli	side	,	there	is	a	new	peace	 move 	 ment 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	solidariot	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 solid 	 arity 	 	in	hebrew	.
the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	using	budrus	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	 recruit 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
they	report	that	israelis	who	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	active	before	,	 up 	 on 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	the	film	,	understand	the	power	of	 non 	 violence 	 	and	start	 join 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	wallajeh	and	the	solidariot	 move 	 ment 	 	show	that	even	a	small	-	budget	 in 	 dependent 	 	film	can	play	a	role	in	 transform 	 ing 	 	 non 	 violence 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	functional	behavior	.
now	imagine	the	power	that	big	media	 player 	 s 	 	could	have	if	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	the	 week 	 ly 	 	 non 	 violent 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 village 	 s 	 	like	bil'in	,	ni'lin	,	in	jerusalem	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	like	sheikh	jarrah	and	silwan	--	the	 non 	 violent 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	would	 be 	 come 	 	more	visible	,	 valu 	 ed 	 	and	effective	in	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	to	understand	that	if	we	do	n't	pay	attention	to	these	 effort 	 s 	 	,	they	are	 in 	 visible 	 	,	and	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
but	i	have	 s 	 een 	 	first	hand	that	if	we	do	,	they	will	 multi 	 ply 	 	.
if	they	 multi 	 ply 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	influence	will	grow	in	the	 over 	 all 	 	israeli	-	palestinian	conflict	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	is	the	kind	of	influence	that	can	 final 	 ly 	 	 un 	 block 	 	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
these	 lead 	 ers 	 	have	proven	that	 non 	 violence 	 	 work 	 s 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	budrus	.
let	's	give	them	attention	so	they	can	prove	it	 work 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
thank	you	.
