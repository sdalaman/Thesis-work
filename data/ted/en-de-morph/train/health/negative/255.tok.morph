you	know	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	'd	like	to	say	 up 	 front 	 	is	that	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	here	by	accident	.
and	what	i	mean	--	not	at	ted	--	that	i	'm	--	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	my	life	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	my	set	of	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	i	would	 tru 	 ly 	 	consider	an	accident	.
but	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	way	in	which	we	could	use	technology	to	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 accident 	 s 	 	happen	often	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	,	when	i	look	back	at	how	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	accident	,	technology	 play 	 ed 	 	a	big	role	in	that	.
so	,	what	i	'd	like	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	 my 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'd	like	to	put	in	 con 	 text 	 	what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	.
and	i	think	you	will	see	why	the	two	 great 	 est 	 	 pass 	 ions 	 	in	my	life	 to 	 day 	 	are	children	and	education	.
and	once	i	put	that	in	 con 	 text 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	technology	:	why	i	 believ 	 e 	 	technology	is	a	tremendous	 enabl 	 er 	 	;	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	to	help	address	some	of	these	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
then	,	about	the	 initi 	 ative 	 	that	chris	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	that	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	launch	at	amd	that	we	call	50x15	.
and	then	i	'll	come	back	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	tell	you	a	little	bit	more	--	 hope 	 fully 	 	 con 	 vince 	 	you	--	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	world	,	it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	business	 lead 	 ers 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	have	an	idea	of	what	 the 	 ir 	 	business	is	all	about	,	but	to	have	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 meaning 	 ful 	 	.
so	,	with	that	in	mind	,	first	of	all	let	me	tell	you	,	i	'm	one	of	five	children	.	i	'm	the	 old 	 est 	 	,	the	other	four	are	women	.
so	i	grew	up	in	a	family	of	women	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	how	to	deal	with	that	part	of	the	world	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	if	you	can	picture	 th 	 is 	 	:	i	was	born	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	village	in	mexico	,	in	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	my	 parent 	 s 	 	did	not	have	a	college	education	.
but	i	was	fortunate	to	be	able	to	have	one	,	and	so	 we 	 re 	 	my	four	 sister 	 s 	 	.
that	kind	of	 tell 	 s 	 	you	a	little	bit	of	an	idea	of	the	 emphas 	 is 	 	that	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 place 	 d 	 	on	education	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 fanatic 	 s 	 	about	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	'll	come	back	to	that	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	.
but	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	me	early	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	and	a	tremendous	curiosity	that	was	 instill 	 ed 	 	in	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	was	through	a	technology	which	is	on	the	screen	--	is	a	victrola	.
my	father	found	that	in	a	 junk 	 yard 	 	,	and	was	able	to	repair	it	and	make	it	work	.	and	 some 	 how 	 	--	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	,	i	 frank 	 ly 	 	do	n't	know	how	he	was	so	aware	of	what	was	going	on	in	the	world	--	but	,	by	 invit 	 ing 	 	me	to	 s 	 it 	 	down	with	him	when	i	was	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	 play 	 ing 	 	 record 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	victrola	by	mozart	,	and	he	would	tell	me	how	mozart	was	the	most	romantic	of	all	the	classic	 compose 	 rs 	 	ever	,	and	how	claire	de	lune	,	which	was	one	of	his	 favor 	 ites 	 	,	was	a	real	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	me	to	 classic 	 al 	 	music	.
he	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	me	about	johann	strauss	,	and	how	he	 create 	 d 	 	the	 waltz 	 es 	 	that	 be 	 came 	 	so	famous	in	the	world	.
and	would	tell	me	a	little	bit	about	 histo 	 ry 	 	too	,	when	he	'd	play	the	1812	overture	by	tchaikovsky	on	 th 	 is 	 	little	victrola	,	and	he	would	tell	me	about	russia	and	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	russia	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 time 	 s 	 	and	why	 th 	 is 	 	music	,	in	some	way	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	of	that	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	even	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	he	was	able	to	instill	in	me	a	lot	of	curiosity	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	to	you	 th 	 is 	 	product	may	not	look	like	high	tech	,	but	if	you	can	imagine	the	time	when	 th 	 is 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	--	it	was	in	the	mid	'40s	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	,	in	his	view	,	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	piece	of	high	tech	.
well	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	to	try	to	distill	from	that	experience	is	that	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	,	people	ask	me	and	say	,	``	well	,	how	did	your	 parent 	 s 	 	treat	you	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	child	?	``
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	tough	on	me	.
and	not	tough	in	the	sense	that	most	people	think	of	,	where	your	 parent 	 s 	 	yell	at	you	or	hit	you	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	tough	in	the	sense	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	grew	up	,	both	my	mother	and	father	would	 al 	 ways 	 	say	to	me	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	you	 al 	 ways 	 	remember	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	when	you	go	to	bed	at	night	,	you	've	got	to	look	back	on	the	day	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	you	felt	the	day	was	a	day	which	you	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	that	you	did	 every 	 thing 	 	you	could	to	do	it	the	best	way	you	could	.
and	the	second	thing	they	 s 	 aid 	 	:	and	we	trust	you	,	that	no	matter	where	you	are	or	where	you	go	,	you	will	 al 	 ways 	 	do	the	right	thing	.
now	,	i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	ever	 d 	 one 	 	that	with	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	but	if	you	do	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	trust	me	,	it	's	the	most	pressure	you	can	put	on	a	child	,	to	say	--	--	we	trust	you	that	you	will	 al 	 ways 	 	do	the	right	thing	.
when	i	was	out	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	beer	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	aware	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	--	--	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	.	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	technology	is	that	it	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 help 	 ful 	 	if	it	is	 use 	 ful 	 	,	of	course	,	but	it	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 help 	 ful 	 	too	if	it	's	 access 	 ible 	 	,	and	it	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 help 	 ful 	 	if	it	's	 afford 	 able 	 	.
and	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	world	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	,	 afford 	 able 	 	and	 access 	 ible 	 	is	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	a	lot	of	the	technology	that	is	 d 	 one 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	one	of	our	 pass 	 ions 	 	in	our	company	,	and	now	one	of	my	personal	 pass 	 ions 	 	,	is	to	be	able	to	 re 	 ally 	 	work	hard	at	making	the	technology	 use 	 ful 	 	,	 access 	 ible 	 	and	 afford 	 able 	 	.
and	to	me	,	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	critical	.
now	,	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	a	lot	since	the	victrola	 day 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	we	now	have	,	of	course	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	.
a	tremendous	thing	that	people	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	a	killer	app	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	we	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	the	killer	app	.
what	we	 believ 	 e 	 	is	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	is	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	of	people	and	 idea 	 s 	 	.
the	 inter 	 net 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	just	the	medium	in	which	 t 	 hose 	 	people	and	 idea 	 s 	 	get	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	power	of	 connect 	 ing 	 	people	and	 idea 	 s 	 	can	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	awesome	.
and	so	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	through	all	the	 change 	 s 	 	that	have	 occur 	 red 	 	,	that	we	're	 face 	 d 	 	 to 	 day 	 	with	a	tremendous	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
if	we	can	connect	people	and	 idea 	 s 	 	more	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	--	and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	a	 ple 	 th 	 ora 	 	and	a	myriad	of	 product 	 s 	 	that	have	come	to	the	market	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	key	to	me	is	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 product 	 s 	 	are	able	to	provide	people	 connect 	 ivity 	 	,	in	a	 use 	 ful 	 	way	,	 access 	 ibility 	 	,	in	an	easy	manner	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 afford 	 ability 	 	,	that	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	economic	 stat 	 us 	 	that	a	person	could	have	,	that	they	could	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	afford	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
so	,	when	you	look	at	that	,	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	we	would	like	to	,	then	,	 en 	 able 	 	that	a	little	bit	.	we	would	like	to	create	an	 initi 	 ative 	 	.
and	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	at	amd	,	we	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	what	if	we	create	 th 	 is 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	we	call	50x15	,	where	we	are	going	to	aim	,	that	by	the	year	2015	,	half	of	the	world	will	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	so	that	people	and	 idea 	 s 	 	can	get	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
we	 k 	 new 	 	we	could	n't	do	it	by	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	by	no	 mean 	 s 	 	did	we	ever	intend	to	 imp 	 ly 	 	that	we	at	amd	could	do	it	 al 	 one 	 	.
we	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	through	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	with	 government 	 s 	 	,	industry	,	 education 	 al 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	,	a	myriad	of	other	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	even	 competitor 	 s 	 	.
so	,	it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	lofty	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	if	you	want	to	think	that	way	,	but	we	felt	that	we	had	to	put	a	real	 s 	 take 	 	up	in	the	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	,	that	was	bold	 en 	 ough 	 	and	 courage 	 ous 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	that	it	would	force	us	all	to	think	of	ways	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	'll	come	back	to	that	in	a	minute	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	the	 result 	 s 	 	so	far	have	 be 	 en 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	,	and	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	 anticip 	 ate 	 	and	get	real	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	what	i	think	is	going	to	happen	in	the	next	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	while	we	get	to	the	2015	 initi 	 ative 	 	.
where	are	we	 to 	 day 	 	?
that	's	year	by	year	.	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	our	 friend 	 s 	 	at	gapminder.com	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	've	never	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	you	should	look	at	it	.	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	.	and	you	can	see	how	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 penet 	 ration 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	so	when	we	 g 	 ave 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 score 	 card 	 	to	say	well	,	where	are	we	related	to	our	goal	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	2015	,	the	thing	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 	is	three	 piece 	 s 	 	.
one	is	the	western	world	,	defined	 most 	 ly 	 	by	western	europe	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	made	an	awful	lot	of	progress	.
the	 connect 	 ivity 	 	in	these	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	 phenomen 	 al 	 	and	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	we	think	 reach 	 ing 	 	100	percent	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 do 	 able 	 	,	even	before	the	2015	 time 	 frame 	 	.	in	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	,	the	progress	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	good	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	solid	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	good	.	but	in	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	not	 a 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	 place 	 s 	 	like	africa	,	latin	america	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	the	progress	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 s 	 low 	 	.	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	i	was	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 visit 	 ing 	 	south	africa	.
i	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	have	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	with	 p 	 resident 	 	mbeki	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	is	,	what	is	it	that	's	 keep 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 connect 	 ivity 	 	goal	from	moving	 a 	 head 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	?
and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	is	,	in	south	africa	,	it	 cost 	 s 	 	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	to	have	a	 broad 	 band 	 	 connect 	 ivity 	 	.
it	is	 im 	 possible 	 	,	even	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	for	that	cost	,	to	be	able	to	 en 	 able 	 	the	 connect 	 ivity 	 	that	we	're	all	 try 	 ing 	 	to	reach	.
so	,	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	ways	in	which	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	one	could	partner	to	be	able	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	cost	of	 th 	 is 	 	technology	down	.
so	,	when	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	chart	,	you	look	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	--	it	's	a	 log 	 arithmic 	 	chart	on	a	 horizon 	 tal 	 	scale	--	you	look	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	:	we	've	got	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	way	to	go	to	get	to	the	2015	goal	of	50	percent	.
but	we	're	 excit 	 ed 	 	in	our	company	;	we	're	 motiv 	 ated 	 	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	think	it	's	a	 phenomen 	 al 	 	driver	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	to	force	us	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	we	look	forward	to	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	so	 man 	 y 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	to	be	able	to	reach	that	goal	.
now	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	'd	like	to	explain	[	about	]	50x15	,	which	i	think	is	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	,	is	that	it	is	not	a	 char 	 ity 	 	.
it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	business	venture	.
let	's	take	a	small	segment	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 connect 	 ed 	 	world	,	and	call	it	the	education	market	.
when	you	look	at	 element 	 ary 	 	-	school	children	,	we	have	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	children	around	the	world	that	could	benefit	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	,	when	we	see	that	,	we	see	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	have	a	business	that	 address 	 es 	 	the	need	of	that	segment	.
and	when	we	 embark 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	we	 s 	 aid 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 char 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	business	venture	,	one	that	 address 	 es 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	segment	of	the	market	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	segment	of	the	market	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	education	or	under	-	 develop 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	either	way	,	it	's	a	segment	that	 demand 	 s 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	high	quality	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	high	 reli 	 ability 	 	,	tremendous	low	cost	and	access	,	and	a	lot	of	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	understand	,	and	i	'll	explain	that	in	just	a	minute	.
it	is	an	 initi 	 ative 	 	that	is	focused	on	simple	,	 access 	 ible 	 	and	human	-	centric	 solution 	 s 	 	.
what	we	mean	by	that	is	,	you	know	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	the	pc	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	1980	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	more	or	less	,	and	for	20	-	odd	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	.
it	is	still	,	in	most	 place 	 s 	 	,	a	gray	or	black	box	,	and	it	 look 	 s 	 	the	same	.
and	 frank 	 ly 	 	--	and	i	know	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	offend	some	of	my	 custom 	 ers 	 	when	i	say	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	i	 tru 	 ly 	 	mean	it	--	if	you	could	take	the	name	of	the	computer	off	the	top	of	it	,	it	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	 judg 	 e 	 	who	made	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	all	 high 	 ly 	 	 commodit 	 ized 	 	but	they	're	all	different	.
so	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	a	human	-	centric	approach	to	 address 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	segment	of	the	market	,	so	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	it	is	critical	to	think	of	it	.
it	 re 	 minded 	 	me	a	lot	of	the	talk	we	heard	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	about	 th 	 is 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	 machine 	 ry 	 	that	was	designed	 specific 	 ally 	 	for	africa	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	here	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	based	on	a	geo	-	sensitive	approach	.
what	i	mean	by	that	is	that	in	some	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	the	government	 play 	 s 	 	a	key	role	in	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	technology	.
in	other	 part 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
in	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	you	have	an	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	for	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	to	take	place	.
in	other	 part 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.	and	then	we	have	to	be	sensitive	about	how	 th 	 is 	 	technology	can	be	 develop 	 ed 	 	and	put	 in 	 to 	 	action	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 region 	 s 	 	.
and	the	last	piece	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	opinion	that	we	have	,	not	 share 	 d 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	where	we	seem	to	stand	 al 	 one 	 	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	--	is	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 great 	 est 	 	success	of	 th 	 is 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	can	come	by	 foster 	 ing 	 	local	,	 integrate 	 d 	 	,	end	-	to	-	end	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
what	i	mean	by	that	,	and	let	me	use	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	country	of	south	africa	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	just	there	,	 there 	 fore 	 	i	'm	a	little	bit	familiar	with	some	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	they	have	.
it	's	a	country	of	45	million	people	.	it	's	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	's	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	.
it	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	grow	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	.
they	have	an	 object 	 ive 	 	to	 lower 	 ing 	 	the	cost	of	 connect 	 ivity 	 	.
they	have	a	computer	company	that	 make 	 s 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	in	south	africa	.
they	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	-	training	environment	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	.
what	a	place	,	what	an	ideal	place	to	create	an	 eco 	 system 	 	that	could	build	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	and	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.	and	to	my	surprise	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	south	africa	they	have	18	 dialect 	 s 	 	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	they	 on 	 ly 	 	had	two	--	english	and	afrikaans	--	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	they	have	18	 dialect 	 s 	 	.
and	to	be	able	to	meet	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	complex	 education 	 al 	 	system	,	it	could	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 d 	 one 	 	from	 in 	 side 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	segment	of	the	market	can	be	 address 	 ed 	 	by	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 parachut 	 ing 	 	from	 an 	 other 	 	place	of	the	world	,	and	just	 dump 	 ing 	 	product	and	selling	 in 	 to 	 	the	 market 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	world	where	the	population	is	large	,	and	there	's	an	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	can	provide	it	,	that	a	local	,	 integrate 	 d 	 	,	end	-	to	-	end	system	is	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	for	 it 	 s 	 	success	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	a	 class 	 room 	 	that	we	 out 	 fitted 	 	with	 computer 	 s 	 	in	mexico	,	in	my	home	country	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 class 	 room 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	in	the	state	of	michoacan	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	that	might	be	familiar	with	mexico	--	michoacan	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 color 	 ful 	 	state	.
children	dress	with	 ver 	 y 	 	 color 	 ful 	 	,	 color 	 ful 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	and	it	is	 in 	 credible 	 	to	see	the	power	that	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 kid 	 s 	 	,	in	a	computer	.	and	i	have	to	tell	you	that	it	's	so	easy	to	appreciate	the	impact	that	access	to	technology	and	 connect 	 ivity 	 	can	have	in	the	 live 	 s 	 	and	education	of	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
we	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	a	 learn 	 ing 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	in	a	school	in	the	west	cape	in	south	africa	,	in	a	school	that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	nelson	mandela	school	,	and	when	you	see	the	 face 	 s 	 	and	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	these	children	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	access	 computer 	 s 	 	,	it	's	just	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
and	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	they	've	written	us	 letter 	 s 	 	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	how	 excit 	 ed 	 	they	are	about	the	impact	that	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	had	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 education 	 al 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 cap 	 abilities 	 	,	and	it	's	just	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
we	have	now	 deploy 	 ed 	 	30	different	 techno 	 logists 	 	in	18	different	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	connect	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	in	an	effort	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	learn	what	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	segment	of	the	market	 need 	 s 	 	and	 demand 	 s 	 	.
and	i	have	to	tell	you	that	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 million 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sound	like	a	lot	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 billion 	 s 	 	that	need	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	a	start	.	and	we	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	lot	.
and	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	tremendous	amount	about	what	we	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	segment	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	be	effective	.
one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	.
some	of	you	are	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	between	mit	and	a	group	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	--	google	is	 involve 	 d 	 	,	red	hat	--	and	amd	is	a	key	player	.
the	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	are	based	on	amd	technology	;	it	's	a	 micro 	 processor 	 	.
but	to	give	you	an	idea	how	creative	 th 	 is 	 	group	of	people	can	be	,	one	of	the	 object 	 ive 	 s 	 	of	the	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	is	to	be	able	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	a	10	-	hour	 batt 	 ery 	 	life	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	felt	that	a	school	day	would	last	at	 l 	 east 	 	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	,	and	you	 want 	 ed 	 	the	child	to	have	the	ability	to	use	the	 lap 	 top 	 	for	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	full	day	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 charge 	 	it	.
the	 engineer 	 s 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	a	 phenomen 	 al 	 	amount	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	part	,	and	 batt 	 ery 	 	life	on	 th 	 is 	 	product	is	now	15	 hour 	 s 	 	--	just	through	a	lot	of	 innov 	 ative 	 	work	people	have	 d 	 one 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	passionate	and	 motiv 	 ated 	 	to	be	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	expect	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	 deploy 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	and	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	at	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	 off 	 er 	 	in	the	field	of	education	.
it	's	a	 high 	 ly 	 	focused	product	 aim 	 ed 	 	at	 strict 	 ly 	 	the	education	market	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	 region 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	can	have	 al 	 so 	 	a	huge	impact	on	the	ability	to	make	education	more	 f 	 un 	 	and	more	efficient	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 partner 	 ed 	 	with	ted	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	with	 architect 	 ure 	 	for	 human 	 ity 	 	,	and	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	ted	prize	winner	cameron	sinclair	,	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	contest	that	we	have	 issue 	 d 	 	to	the	 architect 	 ural 	 	community	to	come	up	with	the	best	design	for	a	computer	lab	for	an	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	region	.
and	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 thrill 	 ed 	 	about	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	be	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	ca	n't	wait	to	see	what	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	 excit 	 ing 	 	activity	.
let	me	come	back	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	to	end	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.
i	'll	tell	you	that	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	feel	is	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	for	us	in	industry	,	in	business	,	is	to	be	able	to	be	passionate	about	solving	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	it	's	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	able	to	put	them	on	a	 spread 	 sheet 	 	,	and	look	at	 number 	 s 	 	and	say	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	's	a	good	business	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	you	have	to	have	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	it	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	too	,	from	my	 parent 	 s 	 	--	and	i	'll	give	you	a	little	anecdote	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	from	my	father	.
and	it	took	me	a	while	to	understand	it	,	but	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	when	i	went	to	college	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	're	the	first	person	in	the	family	to	go	to	college	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	you	understand	that	for	 civil 	 ization 	 	to	make	progress	,	each	generation	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	better	than	the	last	one	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	your	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	do	better	than	my	generation	.	``
 frank 	 ly 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	what	he	told	me	at	the	time	.
i	was	eager	to	go	off	to	college	,	and	go	find	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	 stud 	 y 	 	,	but	then	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	college	and	i	fell	in	love	.
i	 graduate 	 d 	 	.	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	get	married	.
and	on	my	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	day	,	my	father	came	to	me	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	'm	going	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	each	generation	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	better	than	the	last	one	.
you	have	to	be	a	better	husband	than	i	was	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	how	you	make	progress	.	``	and	now	he	 beg 	 an 	 	to	make	sense	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 k 	 new 	 	what	a	great	husband	he	was	,	and	now	he	was	once	 aga 	 in 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	put	pressure	on	me	,	like	he	did	when	i	was	a	little	kid	.	and	then	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	had	a	child	,	my	first	child	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	my	father	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	hospital	,	and	we	're	looking	at	the	glass	,	and	see	all	the	children	on	the	other	side	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	got	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	for	each	generation	to	do	better	,	you	're	going	to	have	to	be	a	better	father	than	i	was	.	``
that	's	when	it	 dawn 	 ed 	 	on	me	the	tremendous	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	he	was	placing	on	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	a	great	father	.
but	the	key	is	that	he	 instill 	 ed 	 	in	me	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	get	up	every	day	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	want	to	do	better	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	get	up	and	think	that	my	role	in	life	is	not	just	to	be	the	ceo	of	a	fortune	500	company	.
it	's	got	to	be	that	 some 	 day 	 	i	can	look	back	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	place	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	better	through	some	small	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	each	of	us	could	make	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
