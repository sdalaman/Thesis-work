chris	anderson	:	welcome	to	ted	.
richard	branson	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	the	first	ted	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	great	.
ca	:	have	you	met	 any 	 one 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	?
rb	:	well	,	the	nice	thing	about	ted	is	 every 	 body 	 	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	glad	to	see	goldie	hawn	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	an	 apolog 	 y 	 	to	make	to	her	.
i	'd	had	 d 	 inner 	 	with	her	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	i	'd	--	she	had	 th 	 is 	 	big	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	ring	and	i	put	it	on	my	finger	and	i	could	n't	get	it	off	.
and	i	went	home	to	my	wife	that	night	and	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	why	i	had	 an 	 other 	 	woman	's	big	,	massive	,	big	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	ring	on	my	finger	.
and	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	we	had	to	go	 a 	 long 	 	to	the	 jewel 	 er 	 	and	get	it	cut	off	.
so	--	--	so	 apolog 	 ies 	 	to	goldie	.
ca	:	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
so	,	we	're	going	to	put	up	some	 slide 	 s 	 	of	some	of	your	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	here	.
you	've	 start 	 ed 	 	one	or	two	in	your	time	.
so	,	you	know	,	virgin	atlantic	,	virgin	 record 	 s 	 	--	i	guess	it	all	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	magazine	 call 	 ed 	 	student	.
and	then	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	all	these	other	 one 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	i	mean	,	how	do	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
rb	:	i	read	all	these	sort	of	ted	 instruct 	 ions 	 	:	you	must	not	talk	about	your	own	business	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	now	you	ask	me	.
so	i	suppose	you	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	kick	me	off	the	stage	,	since	you	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	.
ca	:	it	 depend 	 s 	 	what	the	answer	is	 th 	 ough 	 	.
rb	:	no	,	i	mean	,	i	think	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	early	on	that	if	you	can	run	one	company	,	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	run	any	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
i	mean	,	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	all	about	 find 	 ing 	 	the	right	people	,	inspiring	 t 	 hose 	 	people	,	you	know	,	 draw 	 ing 	 	out	the	best	in	people	.
and	i	just	love	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	i	'm	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	inquisitive	and	i	love	taking	on	,	you	know	,	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	turn	it	 up 	 side 	 	down	.
so	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	life	 a 	 s 	 	one	long	 learn 	 ing 	 	process	.
and	if	i	see	--	you	know	,	if	i	fly	on	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	 air 	 line 	 	and	find	the	experience	is	not	a	 pleas 	 ant 	 	one	,	which	it	was	n't	,	21	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	then	i	'd	think	,	well	,	you	know	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	can	create	the	kind	of	 air 	 line 	 	that	i	'd	like	to	fly	on	.
and	so	,	you	know	,	so	got	one	 second 	 hand 	 	747	from	boeing	and	 g 	 ave 	 	it	a	go	.
ca	:	well	,	that	was	a	bizarre	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	made	 th 	 is 	 	move	that	a	lot	of	people	 advise 	 d 	 	you	was	crazy	.
and	in	fact	,	in	a	way	,	it	 al 	 most 	 	took	down	your	empire	at	one	point	.
i	had	a	conversation	with	one	of	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	 bank 	 ers 	 	who	,	at	the	time	when	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 old 	 	virgin	 record 	 s 	 	and	 invest 	 ed 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	in	virgin	atlantic	,	and	his	view	was	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	the	world	's	fourth	 big 	 gest 	 	record	company	for	the	twenty	-	fifth	 big 	 gest 	 	 air 	 line 	 	and	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	out	of	your	mind	.
why	did	you	do	that	?
rb	:	well	,	i	think	that	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	 divid 	 ing 	 	line	between	success	and	failure	.
and	i	think	if	you	start	a	business	 with 	 out 	 	financial	 back 	 ing 	 	,	you	're	 like 	 ly 	 	to	go	the	wrong	side	of	that	 divid 	 ing 	 	line	.
we	had	--	we	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	by	british	airways	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	our	 air 	 line 	 	out	of	business	,	and	they	 launch 	 ed 	 	what	's	 be 	 come 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	 dirt 	 y 	 	 trick 	 s 	 	campaign	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	whole	empire	was	 like 	 ly 	 	to	come	 crash 	 ing 	 	down	 un 	 less 	 	i	 chip 	 ped 	 	in	a	chip	.
and	in	order	to	protect	the	 job 	 s 	 	of	the	people	who	 work 	 ed 	 	for	the	 air 	 line 	 	,	and	protect	the	 job 	 s 	 	of	the	people	who	 work 	 ed 	 	for	the	record	company	,	i	had	to	sell	the	family	 jewel 	 ry 	 	to	protect	the	 air 	 line 	 	.
ca	:	post	-	napster	,	you	're	looking	like	a	bit	of	a	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	for	that	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
rb	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	it	 prov 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	right	move	.
but	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	was	 s 	 ad 	 	at	the	time	,	but	we	 move 	 d 	 	on	.
ca	:	now	,	you	use	the	virgin	brand	a	lot	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 syn 	 er 	 gy 	 	from	one	thing	to	the	other	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	the	brand	stand	for	in	your	head	?
rb	:	well	,	i	like	to	think	it	 stand 	 s 	 	for	quality	,	that	you	know	,	if	 some 	 body 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	a	virgin	company	,	they	--	ca	:	they	are	quality	,	richard	.	come	on	now	,	 every 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	quality	.	spirit	?
rb	:	no	,	but	i	was	going	to	move	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	have	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	and	i	think	the	people	who	work	for	it	enjoy	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	we	go	in	and	shake	up	other	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	,	and	i	think	,	you	know	,	we	do	it	 different 	 ly 	 	and	i	think	that	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	are	not	 quit 	 e 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	virgin	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	market	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	there	are	a	few	 launch 	 es 	 	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	where	the	brand	 may 	 be 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 work 	 ed 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	mean	,	virgin	 brid 	 es 	 	--	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	?
rb	:	we	could	n't	find	any	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
ca	:	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	why	--	i	think	you	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	with	your	 condom 	 s 	 	launch	.	you	 call 	 ed 	 	it	 mate 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	could	n't	you	have	used	the	virgin	brand	for	that	 a 	 s 	 	well	?
ai	n't	virgin	no	 long 	 er 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
rb	:	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	may	have	had	 problem 	 s 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
i	mean	,	we	had	--	often	,	when	you	launch	a	company	and	you	get	 custom 	 er 	 	 complain 	 ts 	 	,	you	know	,	you	can	deal	with	them	.
but	about	three	 month 	 s 	 	after	the	launch	of	the	condom	company	,	i	had	a	letter	,	a	 complain 	 t 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	and	wrote	a	long	letter	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	 apolog 	 izing 	 	 pro 	 fuse 	 ly 	 	.
but	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	there	was	n't	a	lot	i	could	do	about	it	.
and	then	six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	or	nine	 month 	 s 	 	after	the	problem	had	taken	,	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 light 	 ful 	 	letter	with	a	picture	of	the	baby	 ask 	 ing 	 	if	i	'd	be	 god 	 father 	 	,	which	i	 be 	 came 	 	.
so	,	it	all	 work 	 ed 	 	out	well	.
ca	:	 re 	 ally 	 	?	you	should	have	 br 	 ought 	 	a	picture	.	that	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
rb	:	i	should	have	.
ca	:	so	,	just	help	us	with	some	of	the	 number 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	what	are	the	 number 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	?
i	mean	,	how	big	is	the	group	 over 	 all 	 	?
how	much	--	what	's	the	total	revenue	?
rb	:	it	's	about	25	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	now	,	in	total	.
ca	:	and	how	 man 	 y 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	?
rb	:	about	55,000	.
ca	:	so	,	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 photograph 	 ed 	 	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	ways	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 time 	 s 	 	and	never	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	 put 	 ting 	 	your	dignity	on	the	line	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
what	was	that	?	was	that	real	?
rb	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	 launch 	 ing 	 	a	 mega 	 store 	 	in	los	angeles	,	i	think	.
no	,	i	mean	,	i	think	--	ca	:	but	is	that	your	hair	?
rb	:	no	.
ca	:	what	was	that	one	?
rb	:	dropping	in	for	tea	.
ca	:	ok	.
rb	:	ah	,	that	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.	that	was	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	car	-	boat	in	which	--	ca	:	oh	,	that	car	that	we	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	--	it	was	a	tedster	event	there	,	i	think	.
is	that	--	could	you	still	pause	on	that	one	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	for	a	minute	?
rb	:	it	's	a	tough	job	,	is	n't	it	?
ca	:	i	mean	,	it	is	a	tough	job	.
when	i	first	came	to	america	,	i	used	to	try	 th 	 is 	 	with	 employ 	 ees 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	and	they	kind	of	--	they	have	these	different	 rule 	 s 	 	over	here	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	.
rb	:	i	know	,	i	have	--	the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	say	you	must	n't	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	but	--	ca	:	i	mean	,	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	which	,	tell	us	about	--	rb	:	``	pammy	``	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	--	 mistak 	 en 	 ly 	 	thought	we	could	take	on	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	,	and	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	a	 col 	 a 	 	bottle	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	pammy	``	and	it	was	shaped	a	bit	like	pamela	anderson	.
but	the	trouble	is	,	it	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	 tip 	 ping 	 	over	,	but	--	ca	:	designed	by	philippe	starck	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	?
rb	:	of	course	.
ca	:	so	,	we	'll	just	run	a	couple	more	 picture 	 s 	 	here	.	virgin	 brid 	 es 	 	.	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	.
and	,	ok	,	so	stop	there	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	--	you	had	some	 a 	 ward 	 	i	think	?
rb	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	well	,	25	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	we	'd	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 ex 	 	 pist 	 ol 	 s 	 	'	``	god	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 que 	 en 	 	,	``	and	i	'd	 certain 	 ly 	 	never	 expect 	 ed 	 	that	25	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	that	she	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	 k 	 night 	 	us	.
but	 some 	 how 	 	,	she	must	have	had	a	 forget 	 ful 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	,	i	think	.
ca	:	well	,	god	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	her	and	you	got	your	just	reward	.
do	you	like	to	be	 call 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ir 	 	richard	,	or	how	?
rb	:	 no 	 body 	 	's	ever	 call 	 ed 	 	me	 s 	 ir 	 	richard	.
 occasion 	 ally 	 	in	america	,	i	hear	people	 say 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ir 	 	richard	and	think	there	's	some	shakespearean	play	taking	place	.
but	 no 	 where 	 	else	 any 	 way 	 	.
ca	:	ok	.	so	can	you	use	your	 k 	 night 	 hood 	 	for	 any 	 thing 	 	or	is	it	just	...
rb	:	no	.	i	suppose	if	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	a	 book 	 ing 	 	in	a	restaurant	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	that	might	be	worth	using	it	.
ca	:	you	know	,	it	's	not	richard	branson	.	it	's	 s 	 ir 	 	richard	branson	.
rb	:	i	'll	go	get	the	 secret 	 ary 	 	to	use	it	.
ca	:	ok	.	so	let	's	look	at	the	space	thing	.
i	think	,	with	us	,	we	've	got	a	video	that	 show 	 s 	 	what	you	're	up	to	,	and	virgin	galactic	up	in	the	air	.
so	that	's	the	bert	rutan	designed	 space 	 ship 	 	?
rb	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	'll	be	ready	in	--	well	,	ready	in	12	 month 	 s 	 	and	then	we	do	12	 month 	 s 	 	 extens 	 ive 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	24	 month 	 s 	 	from	now	,	people	will	be	able	to	take	a	ride	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
ca	:	so	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 terior 	 	is	philippe	starcke	designed	?
rb	:	philippe	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	the	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	of	it	:	the	 logo 	 s 	 	and	he	's	building	the	space	station	in	new	mexico	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	he	's	just	taken	an	eye	and	the	space	station	will	be	one	giant	eye	,	so	when	you	're	in	space	,	you	ought	to	be	able	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	massive	eye	looking	up	at	you	.
and	when	you	land	,	you	'll	be	able	to	go	back	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	giant	eye	.
but	he	's	an	absolute	 gen 	 ius 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	design	.
ca	:	but	you	did	n't	have	him	design	the	engine	?
rb	:	philippe	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 er 	 ratic 	 	,	so	i	think	that	he	would	n't	be	the	best	person	to	design	the	engine	,	no	.
ca	:	he	 g 	 ave 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	talk	here	two	 day 	 s 	 	ago	.
rb	:	 yea 	 h 	 	?	no	,	he	is	a	--	ca	:	well	,	some	people	found	it	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	some	people	found	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	bizarre	.
but	,	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	found	it	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
rb	:	he	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	enthusiast	,	which	is	why	i	love	him	.	but	...
ca	:	so	,	now	,	you	've	 al 	 ways 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	exploration	bug	in	you	.
have	you	ever	 regret 	 ted 	 	that	?
rb	:	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	think	with	the	 balloon 	 ing 	 	and	 boat 	 ing 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	past	.
well	,	i	got	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	sea	i	think	six	 time 	 s 	 	by	 helicopter 	 s 	 	,	so	--	and	each	time	,	i	did	n't	expect	to	come	home	to	tell	the	tale	.
so	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	you	 certain 	 ly 	 	wonder	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	up	there	or	--	ca	:	what	was	the	 close 	 st 	 	you	got	to	--	when	did	you	think	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	,	i	might	be	on	my	way	out	?
rb	:	well	,	i	think	the	balloon	 adventure 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	--	each	one	was	,	each	one	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	we	came	close	.
and	,	i	mean	,	first	of	all	we	--	 no 	 body 	 	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	atlantic	in	a	hot	air	balloon	before	,	so	we	had	to	build	a	hot	air	balloon	that	was	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	the	jet	stream	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	when	a	balloon	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	 in 	 to 	 	the	jet	stream	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	the	200	,	220	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	 wind 	 s 	 	that	you	can	find	up	there	.
and	so	,	just	the	 initi 	 al 	 	lift	off	from	sugarloaf	to	cross	the	atlantic	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	jet	stream	,	 th 	 is 	 	enormous	balloon	--	the	top	of	the	balloon	 end 	 ed 	 	up	going	at	a	couple	of	hundred	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	the	 cap 	 sule 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	at	the	bottom	was	going	at	 may 	 be 	 	two	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	and	it	just	took	off	.
and	it	was	like	 hold 	 ing 	 	onto	a	thousand	 horse 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	 cross 	 ing 	 	every	finger	,	 pray 	 ing 	 	that	the	balloon	would	hold	together	,	which	,	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	did	.
but	the	 end 	 s 	 	of	all	 t 	 hose 	 	balloon	 trip 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	you	know	--	 some 	 thing 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	go	wrong	every	time	,	and	on	that	 part 	 icular 	 	occasion	,	the	more	 experience 	 d 	 	 balloon 	 ist 	 	who	was	with	me	 jump 	 ed 	 	,	and	left	me	 hold 	 ing 	 	on	for	dear	life	.
ca	:	did	he	tell	you	to	jump	,	or	he	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	out	of	here	!	``	and	...
rb	:	no	,	he	told	me	jump	,	but	once	his	weight	had	gone	,	the	balloon	just	shot	up	to	12,000	feet	and	i	...
ca	:	and	you	inspired	an	ian	mcewan	novel	i	think	with	that	.
rb	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	no	,	i	put	on	my	oxygen	mask	and	stood	on	top	of	the	balloon	,	with	my	 parachut 	 e 	 	,	looking	at	the	 swirl 	 ing 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	pluck	up	my	courage	to	jump	 in 	 to 	 	the	north	sea	,	which	--	and	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 lone 	 ly 	 	few	 moment 	 s 	 	.
but	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	it	.
ca	:	did	you	jump	?	or	it	came	down	in	the	end	?
rb	:	well	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	had	about	half	an	hour	's	fuel	left	,	and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 k 	 new 	 	that	the	 chance 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	that	if	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	,	i	would	 on 	 ly 	 	have	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	of	life	left	.
so	i	 climb 	 ed 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cap 	 sule 	 	and	just	 desperate 	 ly 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	i	was	making	the	right	decision	.
and	wrote	some	 note 	 s 	 	to	my	family	.	and	then	 climb 	 ed 	 	back	up	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 look 	 ed 	 	down	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 climb 	 ed 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cap 	 sule 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	just	thought	,	there	's	a	better	way	.
i	've	got	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	enormous	balloon	above	me	,	it	's	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 parachut 	 e 	 	ever	,	why	not	use	it	?
and	so	i	 manage 	 d 	 	to	fly	the	balloon	down	through	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	and	about	50	feet	,	before	i	hit	the	sea	,	threw	 my 	 self 	 	over	.
and	the	balloon	hit	the	sea	and	went	 shoot 	 ing 	 	back	up	to	10,000	feet	 with 	 out 	 	me	.
but	it	was	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	that	water	and	--	ca	:	what	did	you	write	to	your	family	?
rb	:	just	what	you	would	do	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	like	that	:	just	i	love	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	and	i	'd	 al 	 ready 	 	written	them	a	letter	before	going	on	 th 	 is 	 	trip	,	which	--	just	in	case	 any 	 thing 	 	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
but	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	they	never	had	to	use	it	.
ca	:	your	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	have	had	 in 	 credible 	 	pr	value	out	of	these	 hero 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
the	 year 	 s 	 	--	and	 un 	 til 	 	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	looking	at	the	 poll 	 s 	 	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	sort	of	 regard 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	great	hero	in	the	u.k.	and	 else 	 where 	 	.
and	 cynic 	 s 	 	might	say	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	smart	business	guy	 do 	 ing 	 	what	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	execute	his	 part 	 icular 	 	style	of	 market 	 ing 	 	.
how	much	was	the	pr	value	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
rb	:	well	,	of	course	,	the	pr	 expert 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	an	 air 	 line 	 	owner	,	the	last	thing	you	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 head 	 ing 	 	off	in	 balloon 	 s 	 	and	 boat 	 s 	 	,	and	 crash 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 sea 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	they	have	a	point	,	richard	.
rb	:	in	fact	,	i	think	our	 air 	 line 	 	took	a	full	page	ad	at	the	time	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	come	on	,	richard	,	there	are	better	ways	of	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	atlantic	.
ca	:	to	do	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	 gen 	 ius 	 	from	the	get	-	go	,	right	?
rb	:	well	,	i	wo	n't	contradict	that	.
ca	:	ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	 hard 	 ball 	 	.	ok	.
did	n't	--	 we 	 re 	 	n't	you	just	 terr 	 ible 	 	at	school	?
rb	:	i	was	 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	.	i	had	no	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 school 	 work 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
i	 certain 	 ly 	 	would	have	 fail 	 ed 	 	iq	 test 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	i	left	school	when	i	was	15	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	if	i	--	if	i	'm	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	,	i	do	n't	grasp	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	,	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	some	 quit 	 e 	 	bizarre	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
i	mean	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	i	've	had	to	--	you	know	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	running	the	largest	group	of	private	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	europe	,	but	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	know	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	net	and	gross	.
and	so	the	board	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
and	so	,	it	's	like	,	good	news	or	bad	news	?
and	 general 	 ly 	 	,	the	people	would	say	,	oh	,	well	that	's	bad	news	.
ca	:	but	just	to	 clar 	 ify 	 	,	the	25	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	is	gross	,	right	?	that	's	gross	?
rb	:	well	,	i	hope	it	's	net	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	--	--	i	've	got	it	right	.
ca	:	no	,	trust	me	,	it	's	gross	.
rb	:	so	,	when	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	50	,	 some 	 body 	 	took	me	 out 	 side 	 	the	 board 	 room 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	richard	,	here	's	a	--	let	me	draw	on	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
here	's	a	net	in	the	sea	,	and	the	fish	have	 be 	 en 	 	 pull 	 ed 	 	from	the	sea	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	net	.
and	that	's	the	 profit 	 s 	 	you	've	got	left	over	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	net	,	 every 	 thing 	 	else	is	eaten	.	``
and	i	 final 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	it	all	out	.
ca	:	but	,	i	mean	,	at	school	--	so	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 mis 	 er 	 ably 	 	 academic 	 ally 	 	,	but	you	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	of	the	cricket	and	 foot 	 ball 	 	 team 	 s 	 	.
so	you	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	a	--	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	natural	 lead 	 er 	 	,	but	just	a	bit	of	a	...	 we 	 re 	 	you	a	rebel	then	,	or	how	would	you	...
rb	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	think	i	was	a	bit	of	a	maverick	and	--	but	i	...	and	i	was	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	was	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	good	at	 s 	 port 	 	,	and	so	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	had	 some 	 thing 	 	to	excel	at	,	at	school	.
ca	:	and	some	bizarre	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	just	 ear 	 lier 	 	in	your	life	.
i	mean	,	there	's	the	story	about	your	mother	 alle 	 ged 	 ly 	 	 dump 	 ing 	 	you	in	a	field	,	aged	four	,	and	 say 	 ing 	 	``	ok	,	walk	home	.	``
did	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	happen	?
rb	:	she	was	,	you	know	,	she	felt	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	stand	on	our	own	two	feet	from	an	early	age	.
so	she	did	 thing 	 s 	 	to	us	,	which	now	she	'd	be	 arrest 	 ed 	 	for	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	us	out	of	the	car	,	and	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	to	find	our	own	way	to	 grann 	 y 	 	's	,	about	five	 mile 	 s 	 	before	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	there	.
and	making	us	go	on	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	long	bike	 ride 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	never	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	watch	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	the	like	.
ca	:	but	is	there	a	risk	here	?
i	mean	,	there	's	a	lot	of	people	in	the	room	who	are	 wealth 	 y 	 	,	and	they	've	got	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	we	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	dilemma	about	how	you	 br 	 ing 	 	them	up	.
do	you	look	at	the	current	generation	of	 kid 	 s 	 	coming	up	and	think	they	're	too	coddled	,	they	do	n't	know	what	they	've	got	,	we	're	going	to	raise	a	generation	of	 privilege 	 d 	 	...
rb	:	no	,	i	think	if	you	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	up	 kid 	 s 	 	,	you	just	want	to	 s 	 mother 	 	them	with	love	and	praise	and	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	.
so	i	do	n't	think	you	can	mollycoddle	your	 kid 	 s 	 	too	much	 re 	 ally 	 	.
ca	:	you	did	n't	turn	out	too	bad	,	i	have	to	say	,	i	'm	...
your	 head 	 master 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	you	--	i	mean	he	found	you	kind	of	an	enigma	at	your	school	--	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	're	either	going	to	be	a	millionaire	or	go	to	 pri 	 son 	 	,	and	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	which	.
which	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	first	?
rb	:	well	,	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	both	.	i	think	i	went	to	 pri 	 son 	 	first	.
i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 prosecut 	 ed 	 	under	two	 quit 	 e 	 	ancient	 act 	 s 	 	in	the	u.k	.
i	was	 prosecut 	 ed 	 	under	the	1889	 vene 	 real 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	act	and	the	1916	 in 	 de 	 cent 	 	 advertise 	 ments 	 	act	.
on	the	first	occasion	,	for	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	the	word	 vene 	 real 	 	disease	in	public	,	which	--	we	had	a	center	where	we	would	help	young	people	who	had	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	young	people	have	is	 vene 	 real 	 	disease	.
and	there	's	an	ancient	law	that	 say 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	word	 vene 	 real 	 	disease	or	print	it	in	public	.
so	the	police	 knock 	 ed 	 	on	the	door	,	and	told	us	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	arrest	us	if	we	carried	on	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	the	word	 vene 	 real 	 	disease	.
we	 change 	 d 	 	it	to	social	 disease 	 s 	 	and	people	came	 a 	 long 	 	with	 ac 	 ne 	 	and	 spot 	 s 	 	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	came	with	vd	any	more	.
so	,	we	put	it	back	to	vd	and	 prompt 	 ly 	 	got	 arrest 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	,	``	never	mind	the	 bol 	 lock 	 s 	 	,	here	's	the	 s 	 ex 	 	 pist 	 ol 	 s 	 	,	``	the	word	 bol 	 lock 	 s 	 	,	the	police	 decide 	 d 	 	was	a	rude	word	and	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 arrest 	 ed 	 	for	using	the	word	 bol 	 lock 	 s 	 	on	the	 s 	 ex 	 	 pist 	 ol 	 s 	 	'	 al 	 bum 	 	.
and	john	mortimer	,	the	playwright	,	 defend 	 ed 	 	us	.

and	so	i	rang	up	nottingham	university	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	talk	to	the	professor	of	 linguist 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	 bol 	 lock 	 s 	 	is	not	a	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 ball 	 s 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 nick 	 name 	 	 give 	 n 	 	to	 priest 	 s 	 	in	the	 eight 	 een 	 th 	 	century	.	``
and	he	went	,	``	 further 	 more 	 	,	i	'm	a	priest	 my 	 self 	 	.	``

and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	 definite 	 ly 	 	.	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	``
ca	:	that	's	great	.
rb	:	so	our	key	witness	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	``	never	mind	the	priest	,	here	's	the	 s 	 ex 	 	 pist 	 ol 	 s 	 	.	``
and	the	 judg 	 e 	 	found	us	--	 reluct 	 ant 	 ly 	 	found	us	not	 guilt 	 y 	 	,	so	...
ca	:	that	is	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	.
so	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	is	there	a	dark	side	?
a	lot	of	people	would	say	there	's	no	way	that	 some 	 one 	 	could	put	together	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 business 	 es 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 kn 	 if 	 ing 	 	a	few	people	in	the	back	,	you	know	,	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 ug 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 accus 	 ed 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 ruth 	 less 	 	.
there	was	a	nasty	 bio 	 graphy 	 	written	about	you	by	 some 	 one 	 	.
is	any	of	it	true	?	is	there	an	element	of	truth	in	it	?
rb	:	i	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	that	the	 stereo 	 type 	 	of	a	 business 	 person 	 	 tread 	 ing 	 	all	over	people	to	get	to	the	top	,	 general 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	 work 	 s 	 	.
i	think	if	you	treat	people	well	,	people	will	come	back	and	come	back	for	more	.
and	i	think	all	you	have	in	life	is	your	reputation	and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	world	.
and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	that	the	best	way	of	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 success 	 ful 	 	business	 lead 	 er 	 	is	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	people	 fair 	 ly 	 	and	well	,	and	i	like	to	think	that	's	how	we	run	virgin	.
ca	:	and	what	about	the	people	who	love	you	and	who	see	you	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	--	you	keep	 get 	 ting 	 	caught	up	in	these	new	 project 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 al 	 most 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	like	you	're	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	 launch 	 ing 	 	new	stuff	.
you	get	 excit 	 ed 	 	by	an	idea	and	,	 ka 	 pow 	 	!
i	mean	,	do	you	think	about	life	balance	?
how	do	your	family	feel	about	each	time	you	step	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	big	and	new	?
rb	:	i	 al 	 so 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 be 	 ing 	 	a	father	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	so	from	the	time	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	young	,	you	know	,	when	they	go	on	 holi 	 day 	 	,	i	go	on	 holi 	 day 	 	with	them	.
and	so	we	 s 	 pend 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	sort	of	three	 month 	 s 	 	away	together	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	i	'll	,	you	know	,	be	in	touch	.	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	little	 is 	 land 	 	in	the	caribbean	and	we	can	--	so	i	can	take	them	there	and	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	play	together	,	but	i	can	 al 	 so 	 	keep	in	touch	with	what	's	going	on	.
ca	:	you	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	term	 capital 	 ist 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
what	is	that	?
rb	:	 capital 	 ism 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	proven	to	be	a	system	that	 work 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	the	 alter 	 native 	 	,	 commun 	 ism 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 work 	 ed 	 	.
but	the	problem	with	 capital 	 ism 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 	wealth	 end 	 s 	 	up	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	a	few	people	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	i	think	,	 go 	 es 	 	with	that	wealth	.
and	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	the	 individual 	 s 	 	,	who	are	in	that	fortunate	position	,	do	not	end	up	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	for	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	 boat 	 s 	 	,	and	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	but	,	you	know	,	use	that	money	to	either	create	new	 job 	 s 	 	or	to	tackle	 issue 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
ca	:	and	what	are	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	you	worry	about	most	,	care	most	about	,	want	to	turn	your	 resource 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	?
rb	:	well	,	there	's	--	i	mean	there	's	a	lot	of	 issue 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	is	a	massive	threat	to	 man 	 kind 	 	and	we	are	 put 	 ting 	 	a	lot	of	time	and	energy	 in 	 to 	 	,	a	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	come	up	with	 alter 	 native 	 	 fuel 	 s 	 	and	,	b	,	you	know	,	we	just	 launch 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	prize	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	prize	in	case	we	do	n't	get	an	answer	on	 alter 	 native 	 	 fuel 	 s 	 	,	in	case	we	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	manage	to	get	the	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	cut	down	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	in	case	we	go	through	the	 tip 	 ping 	 	point	.
we	need	to	try	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	people	to	come	up	with	a	way	of	 ex 	 tract 	 ing 	 	carbon	out	of	the	earth	's	atmosphere	.
and	we	just	--	you	know	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	people	 work 	 ing 	 	on	that	before	,	so	we	 want 	 ed 	 	people	to	try	to	--	all	the	best	 brain 	 s 	 	in	the	world	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	try	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	 m 	 ethane 	 	out	of	the	earth	's	atmosphere	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	had	about	15,000	people	fill	in	the	 form 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	they	want	to	give	it	a	go	.
and	so	we	 on 	 ly 	 	need	one	,	so	we	're	 hope 	 ful 	 	.
ca	:	and	you	're	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	africa	on	a	couple	of	 project 	 s 	 	?
rb	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	mean	,	we	've	got	--	we	're	setting	up	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	war	room	,	which	is	 may 	 be 	 	the	wrong	word	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	--	 may 	 be 	 	we	'll	change	it	--	but	 any 	 way 	 	,	it	's	a	war	room	to	try	to	coordinate	all	the	attack	that	's	going	on	in	africa	,	all	the	different	social	 problem 	 s 	 	in	africa	,	and	try	to	look	at	best	 practice 	 s 	 	.
so	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	there	's	a	doctor	in	africa	that	's	found	that	if	you	give	a	mother	 anti 	 retroviral 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	at	24	 week 	 s 	 	,	when	she	's	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	that	the	baby	will	not	have	hiv	when	it	's	born	.
and	so	 dis 	 semi 	 nating 	 	that	information	to	around	the	rest	of	africa	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
ca	:	the	war	room	 sound 	 s 	 	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	and	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
and	is	there	a	risk	that	the	kind	of	the	business	heroes	of	the	west	get	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	--	i	mean	,	they	're	used	to	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	idea	,	 get 	 ting 	 	stuff	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	they	 believ 	 e 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	world	.
is	there	a	risk	that	we	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	like	africa	and	say	,	we	've	got	to	fix	 th 	 is 	 	problem	and	we	can	do	it	,	i	've	got	all	these	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	da	,	da	,	da	--	here	's	the	big	idea	.	and	kind	of	take	a	much	more	complex	 situ 	 ation 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	end	up	making	a	mess	of	it	.	do	you	worry	about	that	?
rb	:	well	,	first	of	all	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	government	on	it	.
i	mean	,	thabo	mbeki	's	had	his	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 accept 	 ing 	 	hiv	and	 aid 	 s 	 	are	related	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	way	,	i	think	,	of	him	 tack 	 ling 	 	 th 	 is 	 	problem	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	world	 critic 	 izing 	 	him	,	it	's	a	way	of	 work 	 ing 	 	with	him	,	with	his	government	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	if	people	do	go	to	africa	and	do	try	to	help	,	they	do	n't	just	go	in	there	and	then	 leav 	 e 	 	after	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	got	to	be	 consist 	 ent 	 	.
but	i	think	business	 lead 	 ers 	 	can	 br 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	know	-	how	and	help	 government 	 s 	 	approach	 thing 	 s 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	we	're	setting	up	 clinic 	 s 	 	in	africa	where	we	're	going	to	be	giving	free	 anti 	 retroviral 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	,	free	tb	 treat 	 ment 	 	and	free	malaria	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
but	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	them	self	-	 sustain 	 ing 	 	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	so	that	people	pay	for	some	other	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	i	mean	a	lot	of	 cynic 	 s 	 	say	about	 some 	 one 	 	like	 your 	 self 	 	,	or	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	driven	by	some	sort	of	 desir 	 e 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	know	,	for	the	right	image	,	for	guilt	 avoid 	 ance 	 	and	not	like	a	real	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	instinct	.
what	would	you	say	to	them	?
rb	:	well	,	i	think	that	 every 	 body 	 	--	people	do	 thing 	 s 	 	for	a	whole	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	different	 reason 	 s 	 	and	i	think	that	,	you	know	,	when	i	'm	on	me	 death 	 bed 	 	,	i	will	want	to	feel	that	i	've	made	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	to	other	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	that	may	be	a	 self 	 ish 	 	thing	to	think	,	but	it	's	the	way	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	up	.
i	think	if	i	'm	in	a	position	to	 radical 	 ly 	 	change	other	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	for	the	better	,	i	should	do	so	.
ca	:	how	old	are	you	?
rb	:	i	'm	56	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	the	 psycho 	 logist 	 	erik	erikson	 say 	 s 	 	that	--	 a 	 s 	 	i	understand	him	and	i	'm	a	total	amateur	--	but	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	30s	,	40s	people	are	driven	by	 th 	 is 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	to	grow	and	that	's	where	they	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	.
50s	,	60s	,	the	mode	of	operation	 shift 	 s 	 	more	to	the	quest	for	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	a	search	for	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	you	're	still	a	little	bit	in	the	growth	 phase 	 s 	 	,	you	're	still	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 in 	 credible 	 	new	 plan 	 s 	 	.
how	much	do	you	think	about	 leg 	 acy 	 	,	and	what	would	you	like	your	 leg 	 acy 	 	to	be	?
rb	:	i	do	n't	think	i	think	too	much	about	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	like	to	--	you	know	,	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	lived	to	101	,	so	 hope 	 fully 	 	i	've	got	 an 	 other 	 	30	or	40	 year 	 s 	 	to	go	.
no	,	i	just	want	to	live	life	to	 it 	 s 	 	full	.
you	know	,	if	i	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	i	hope	to	be	able	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	i	think	one	of	the	positive	 thing 	 s 	 	at	the	moment	is	you	've	got	sergey	and	larry	from	google	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	who	are	good	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	,	thank	god	,	you	've	got	two	people	who	 genuine 	 ly 	 	care	about	the	world	and	with	that	kind	of	wealth	.
if	they	had	that	kind	of	wealth	and	they	did	n't	care	about	the	world	,	it	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	know	they	're	going	to	make	a	hell	of	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	to	the	world	.
and	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	people	in	that	kind	of	position	do	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
ca	:	well	,	richard	,	when	i	was	 start 	 ing 	 	off	in	business	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	it	and	i	 al 	 so 	 	was	sort	of	--	i	thought	that	business	people	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	just	be	 ruth 	 less 	 	and	that	that	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	you	could	have	a	chance	of	 succeed 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	inspire	me	.	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	you	,	i	thought	,	well	,	he	's	made	it	.	 may 	 be 	 	there	is	a	different	way	.
so	i	would	like	to	thank	you	for	that	inspiration	,	and	for	coming	to	ted	 to 	 day 	 	.	thank	you	.
thank	you	so	much	.
