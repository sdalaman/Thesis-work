let	me	talk	about	india	through	the	evolution	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
now	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	way	of	looking	at	it	 be 	 cause 	 	in	every	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	an	open	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	when	 idea 	 s 	 	take	root	that	 thing 	 s 	 	change	.
 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	lead	to	 ideo 	 logy 	 	,	lead	to	 poli 	 cies 	 	that	lead	to	 action 	 s 	 	.
in	1930	 th 	 is 	 	country	went	through	a	great	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	which	led	to	all	the	 idea 	 s 	 	of	the	state	and	social	security	,	and	all	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	roosevelt	's	time	.
in	the	1980s	we	had	the	reagan	revolution	,	which	lead	to	 de 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	after	the	global	economic	crisis	,	there	was	a	whole	new	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	about	how	the	state	should	 inter 	 vene 	 	.
so	 idea 	 s 	 	change	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	india	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	there	are	four	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	which	 re 	 ally 	 	make	an	impact	on	india	.
the	first	,	to	my	mind	,	is	what	i	call	 a 	 s 	 	``	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	have	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.	``
these	 idea 	 s 	 	have	 br 	 ought 	 	together	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	made	india	happen	the	way	it	is	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	second	set	of	 idea 	 s 	 	i	call	``	 idea 	 s 	 	in	progress	.	``
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 idea 	 s 	 	which	have	 be 	 en 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	but	not	 implement 	 ed 	 	yet	.
the	third	set	of	 idea 	 s 	 	are	what	i	call	 a 	 s 	 	``	 idea 	 s 	 	that	we	 argu 	 e 	 	about	``	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 idea 	 s 	 	where	we	have	a	fight	,	an	 ideo 	 logical 	 	battle	about	how	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	the	fourth	thing	,	which	i	 believ 	 e 	 	is	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	is	``	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	are	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	in	the	world	where	you	can	see	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	other	 count 	 ries 	 	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 anticip 	 ate 	 	what	that	did	and	do	 thing 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
now	in	india	's	case	i	 believ 	 e 	 	there	are	six	 idea 	 s 	 	which	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	where	it	 ha 	 s 	 	come	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	first	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	people	.
in	the	'60s	and	'70s	we	thought	of	people	 a 	 s 	 	a	burden	.
we	thought	of	people	 a 	 s 	 	a	 li 	 ability 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	talk	of	people	 a 	 s 	 	an	asset	.
we	talk	of	people	 a 	 s 	 	human	capital	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	change	in	the	 mind 	 set 	 	,	of	looking	at	people	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	of	a	burden	to	human	capital	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	one	of	the	fundamental	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	indian	 mind 	 set 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	change	in	 think 	 ing 	 	of	human	capital	is	linked	to	the	fact	that	india	is	going	through	a	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 divid 	 end 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 health 	 care 	 	 improve 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 go 	 es 	 	down	,	 fertil 	 ity 	 	rates	start	dropping	.	and	india	is	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	that	.
india	is	going	to	have	a	lot	of	young	people	with	a	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 divid 	 end 	 	for	the	next	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
what	is	 un 	 ique 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 divid 	 end 	 	is	that	india	will	be	the	 on 	 ly 	 	country	in	the	world	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 divid 	 end 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	will	be	the	 on 	 ly 	 	young	country	in	an	aging	world	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	at	the	same	time	if	you	peel	away	the	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 divid 	 end 	 	in	india	,	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	two	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 curv 	 es 	 	.
one	is	in	the	south	and	in	the	west	of	india	,	which	is	 al 	 ready 	 	going	to	be	fully	 expense 	 d 	 	by	2015	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	that	part	of	the	country	,	the	 fertil 	 ity 	 	rate	is	 al 	 most 	 	equal	to	that	of	a	west	european	country	.
then	there	is	the	whole	 north 	 ern 	 	india	,	which	is	going	to	be	the	bulk	of	the	future	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 divid 	 end 	 	.
but	a	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 divid 	 end 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	your	human	capital	.
 on 	 ly 	 	if	the	people	have	education	,	they	have	good	health	,	they	have	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	they	have	 road 	 s 	 	to	go	to	work	,	they	have	 light 	 s 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	at	night	--	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 case 	 s 	 	can	you	 re 	 ally 	 	get	the	benefit	of	a	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 divid 	 end 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	if	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	invest	in	the	human	capital	,	the	same	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 divid 	 end 	 	can	be	a	 demo 	 graphic 	 	disaster	.
 there 	 fore 	 	india	is	at	a	critical	point	where	either	it	can	leverage	 it 	 s 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 divid 	 end 	 	or	it	can	lead	to	a	 demo 	 graphic 	 	disaster	.
the	second	thing	in	india	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	change	in	the	role	of	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
when	india	got	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	bad	lot	,	 a 	 s 	 	people	who	would	exploit	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	after	60	 year 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	rise	of	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	,	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	role	 model 	 s 	 	,	and	they	are	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	 huge 	 ly 	 	to	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	change	 ha 	 s 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	the	 vital 	 ity 	 	and	the	whole	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
the	third	big	thing	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	india	is	our	attitude	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	english	language	.
english	language	was	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	language	of	the	 imperial 	 ists 	 	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	with	 global 	 ization 	 	,	with	 out 	 sourcing 	 	,	english	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	language	of	 aspir 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	made	it	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	learn	.
and	the	fact	that	we	have	english	is	now	 be 	 coming 	 	a	huge	 strat 	 egic 	 	asset	.
the	next	thing	is	technology	.
forty	 year 	 s 	 	back	,	 computer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	was	 forbid 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	which	was	 intimid 	 ating 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 reduc 	 ed 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	live	in	a	country	which	 sell 	 s 	 	eight	million	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	a	month	,	of	which	90	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 paid 	 	 phone 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	do	n't	have	credit	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
forty	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 pre 	 paid 	 	 phone 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 charged 	 	at	less	than	20	 cent 	 s 	 	at	each	 re 	 charge 	 	.
that	is	the	scale	at	which	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 liberate 	 d 	 	and	made	it	 access 	 ible 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 forbid 	 d 	 ing 	 	and	 intimid 	 ating 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 empower 	 ing 	 	.
twenty	 year 	 s 	 	back	,	when	there	was	a	report	on	bank	 computer 	 ization 	 	,	they	did	n't	name	the	report	 a 	 s 	 	a	report	on	 computer 	 s 	 	,	they	call	them	 a 	 s 	 	``	 led 	 ger 	 	 post 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.	``
they	did	n't	want	the	 un 	 ions 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	.
and	when	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	more	 advance 	 d 	 	,	more	 power 	 ful 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	they	 call 	 ed 	 	them	``	 advance 	 d 	 	 led 	 ger 	 	 post 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.	``
so	we	have	come	a	long	way	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	where	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	an	instrument	of	 empower 	 ment 	 	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	think	of	technology	.
and	then	i	think	the	other	point	is	that	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	far	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	 global 	 ization 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	after	 hav 	 ing 	 	lived	for	more	than	200	 year 	 s 	 	under	the	east	india	company	and	under	imperial	rule	,	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	natural	 re 	 action 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 global 	 ization 	 	 believ 	 ing 	 	it	was	a	form	of	 imperial 	 ism 	 	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	indian	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	go	 a 	 broad 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	come	and	work	all	over	the	world	,	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	have	 gain 	 ed 	 	a	lot	more	confidence	and	have	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 global 	 ization 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	they	can	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	.
and	the	fact	that	the	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	are	in	our	favor	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	the	 on 	 ly 	 	young	country	in	an	aging	world	,	 make 	 s 	 	 global 	 ization 	 	all	the	more	 attract 	 ive 	 	to	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	india	 ha 	 s 	 	had	the	 deepen 	 ing 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
when	 demo 	 cracy 	 	came	to	india	60	 year 	 s 	 	back	it	was	an	elite	 con 	 cept 	 	.
it	was	a	bunch	of	people	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	the	idea	of	universal	 vot 	 ing 	 	and	parliament	and	 constit 	 ution 	 	and	so	forth	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	bottom	-	up	process	where	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	voice	,	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	an	open	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	these	six	 factor 	 s 	 	--	the	rise	of	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	population	 a 	 s 	 	human	capital	,	the	rise	of	indian	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	the	rise	of	english	 a 	 s 	 	a	language	of	 aspir 	 ation 	 	,	technology	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 empower 	 ing 	 	,	 global 	 ization 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	positive	factor	,	and	the	 deepen 	 ing 	 	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	why	india	is	 to 	 day 	 	growing	at	rates	it	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
but	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	then	we	come	to	what	i	call	 a 	 s 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	in	progress	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 idea 	 s 	 	where	there	is	no	argument	in	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	but	you	are	not	able	to	implement	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	there	are	four	 thing 	 s 	 	here	.
one	is	the	question	of	education	.
for	some	reason	,	 what 	 ever 	 	reason	--	lack	of	money	,	lack	of	 prior 	 ities 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	 old 	 er 	 	culture	--	 prim 	 ary 	 	education	was	never	 give 	 n 	 	the	focus	it	 requir 	 ed 	 	.
but	now	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	point	where	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	the	government	 school 	 s 	 	do	n't	function	,	so	children	are	going	to	private	 school 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
even	in	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	of	india	more	than	50	percent	of	urban	 kid 	 s 	 	are	going	 in 	 to 	 	private	 school 	 s 	 	.
so	there	is	a	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	in	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 school 	 s 	 	to	work	.
but	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	there	is	an	enormous	 desir 	 e 	 	among	 every 	 body 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	poor	,	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
so	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	education	is	an	idea	which	is	 arriv 	 ed 	 	but	not	yet	 implement 	 ed 	 	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	 infra 	 structure 	 	--	for	a	long	time	,	 infra 	 structure 	 	was	not	a	 prior 	 ity 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	to	india	have	 s 	 een 	 	that	.
it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	like	 chin 	 a 	 	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	 agree 	 d 	 	 up 	 on 	 	and	which	people	want	to	implement	.
it	is	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 state 	 ments 	 	.
20	 year 	 s 	 	back	the	 politic 	 al 	 	slogan	was	,	``	roti	,	kapada	,	makaan	,	``	which	 me 	 ant 	 	,	``	food	,	 cloth 	 ing 	 	and	shelter	.	``
and	 to 	 day 	 	's	 politic 	 al 	 	slogan	is	,	``	bijli	,	 s 	 ad 	 ak 	 	,	 pan 	 i 	 	,	``	which	 mean 	 s 	 	``	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	water	and	 road 	 s 	 	.	``
and	that	is	a	change	in	the	 mind 	 set 	 	where	 infra 	 structure 	 	is	now	 accept 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	idea	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	but	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	 implement 	 ed 	 	.
the	third	thing	is	 aga 	 in 	 	cities	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	gandhi	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	 village 	 s 	 	and	 be 	 cause 	 	the	british	 rul 	 ed 	 	from	the	cities	,	 there 	 fore 	 	nehru	thought	of	new	delhi	 a 	 s 	 	an	un	-	indian	city	.
for	a	long	time	we	have	 neglect 	 ed 	 	our	cities	.
and	that	is	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	that	you	see	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	after	economic	 reform 	 s 	 	,	and	economic	growth	,	i	think	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	cities	are	 engine 	 s 	 	of	economic	growth	,	cities	are	 engine 	 s 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	cities	are	 engine 	 s 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	have	 final 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	think	now	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	move	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 improv 	 ing 	 	our	cities	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	an	idea	which	is	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	but	not	yet	 implement 	 ed 	 	.
the	final	thing	is	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	india	 a 	 s 	 	a	single	market	--	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	did	n't	think	of	india	 a 	 s 	 	a	market	,	you	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 both 	 er 	 	about	a	single	market	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	you	had	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	every	state	had	 it 	 s 	 	own	market	for	 product 	 s 	 	.
every	 pro 	 vince 	 	had	 it 	 s 	 	own	market	for	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
 increasing 	 ly 	 	now	the	 poli 	 cies 	 	of	 tax 	 ation 	 	and	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	all	that	,	are	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	creating	india	 a 	 s 	 	a	single	market	.
so	there	is	a	form	of	internal	 global 	 ization 	 	which	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	external	 global 	 ization 	 	.
these	four	 factor 	 s 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	--	the	 one 	 s 	 	of	 prim 	 ary 	 	education	,	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	 urban 	 ization 	 	,	and	single	market	--	in	my	view	are	 idea 	 s 	 	in	india	which	have	 be 	 en 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	,	but	not	 implement 	 ed 	 	.
then	we	have	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	are	the	 idea 	 s 	 	in	conflict	.
the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	we	 argu 	 e 	 	about	.
these	are	the	 argument 	 s 	 	we	have	which	cause	 grid 	 lock 	 	.
what	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	?	one	is	,	i	think	,	are	 ideo 	 logical 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 historic 	 al 	 	indian	 back 	 ground 	 	,	in	the	 cast 	 e 	 	system	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	fact	that	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	left	out	in	the	cold	,	a	lot	of	the	 politic 	 s 	 	is	about	how	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	'll	address	that	.
and	it	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 reservation 	 s 	 	and	other	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	related	to	the	way	that	we	subsidize	our	people	,	and	all	the	left	and	right	 argument 	 s 	 	that	we	have	.
a	lot	of	the	indian	 problem 	 s 	 	are	related	to	the	 ideo 	 logy 	 	of	 cast 	 e 	 	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	policy	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	 grid 	 lock 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 factor 	 s 	 	which	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	resolved	.
the	second	one	is	the	labor	 poli 	 cies 	 	that	we	have	,	which	make	it	so	difficult	for	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	to	create	 standard 	 ized 	 	 job 	 s 	 	in	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	that	93	percent	of	indian	labor	is	in	the	 un 	 organize 	 d 	 	sector	.
they	have	no	 benefit 	 s 	 	:	they	do	n't	have	social	security	;	they	do	n't	have	pension	;	they	do	n't	have	 health 	 care 	 	;	 non 	 e 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 fix 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 un 	 less 	 	you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	these	people	 in 	 to 	 	the	 form 	 al 	 	 work 	 force 	 	,	you	will	end	up	creating	a	whole	lot	of	people	who	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 enfranchis 	 ed 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	we	need	to	create	a	new	set	of	labor	 law 	 s 	 	,	which	are	not	 a 	 s 	 	 on 	 er 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
at	the	same	time	give	a	policy	for	a	lot	more	people	to	be	in	the	 form 	 al 	 	sector	,	and	create	the	 job 	 s 	 	for	the	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	that	we	need	to	create	 job 	 s 	 	for	.
the	third	thing	is	our	 high 	 er 	 	education	.
indian	 high 	 er 	 	education	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 regulat 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	start	a	private	university	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	for	a	foreign	university	to	come	to	india	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	our	 high 	 er 	 	education	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	 keep 	 ing 	 	pace	with	india	's	 demand 	 s 	 	.
that	is	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	which	we	need	to	address	.
but	most	 import 	 ant 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	are	the	 idea 	 s 	 	we	need	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	.
here	india	can	look	at	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	west	and	 else 	 where 	 	,	and	look	at	what	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
the	first	thing	is	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	fortunate	that	technology	is	at	a	point	where	it	is	much	more	 advance 	 d 	 	than	when	other	 count 	 ries 	 	had	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
so	we	can	use	technology	for	 govern 	 ance 	 	.
we	can	use	technology	for	direct	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
we	can	use	technology	for	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	second	thing	is	,	the	health	issue	.
india	 ha 	 s 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	health	 problem 	 s 	 	of	the	 high 	 er 	 	state	of	cardiac	issue	,	the	 high 	 er 	 	state	of	diabetes	,	the	 high 	 er 	 	state	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	.
so	there	is	no	point	in	 re 	 placing 	 	a	set	of	poor	country	 disease 	 s 	 	with	a	set	of	rich	country	 disease 	 s 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	we	're	to	 re 	 think 	 	the	whole	way	we	look	at	health	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	put	in	place	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	so	that	we	do	n't	go	to	the	other	 extrem 	 e 	 	of	health	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	 to 	 day 	 	in	the	west	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	problem	of	entitlement	--	the	cost	of	social	security	,	the	cost	of	medicare	,	the	cost	of	medicaid	.
 there 	 fore 	 	when	you	are	a	young	country	,	 aga 	 in 	 	you	have	a	chance	to	put	in	place	a	modern	pension	system	so	that	you	do	n't	create	entitlement	 problem 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	grow	old	.
and	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	india	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	the	 luxur 	 y 	 	of	making	 it 	 s 	 	environment	 dirt 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	marry	environment	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
just	to	give	an	idea	,	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 stabil 	 ize 	 	at	 some 	 thing 	 	like	20	 giga 	 ton 	 s 	 	per	year	.
on	a	population	of	nine	billion	our	average	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 	will	have	to	be	about	two	 ton 	 s 	 	per	year	.
india	is	 al 	 ready 	 	at	two	 ton 	 s 	 	per	year	.
but	if	india	 grow 	 s 	 	at	 some 	 thing 	 	like	eight	percent	,	income	per	year	per	person	will	go	to	16	 time 	 s 	 	by	2050	.
so	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	:	income	growing	at	16	 time 	 s 	 	and	no	growth	in	carbon	.
 there 	 fore 	 	we	will	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 re 	 think 	 	the	way	we	look	at	the	environment	,	the	way	we	look	at	energy	,	the	way	we	create	whole	new	 paradigm 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
now	why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	matter	to	you	?
why	 do 	 es 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	10	thousand	 mile 	 s 	 	away	matter	to	all	of	you	?
number	one	,	 th 	 is 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	more	than	a	billion	people	.
a	billion	people	,	1/6th	of	the	world	population	.
it	 matter 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
and	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	prove	that	growth	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	are	not	 in 	 compatible 	 	,	that	you	can	have	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	that	you	can	have	an	open	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	and	you	can	have	growth	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	solve	these	 problem 	 s 	 	,	you	can	solve	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	poverty	in	the	world	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	need	it	to	solve	the	world	's	environment	 problem 	 s 	 	.
if	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	come	to	a	point	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	put	a	cap	on	our	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 	,	we	want	to	 re 	 ally 	 	lower	the	use	of	energy	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 solve 	 d 	 	in	 count 	 ries 	 	like	india	.
you	know	if	you	look	at	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	the	west	over	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	average	growth	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	about	two	percent	.
here	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 count 	 ries 	 	growing	at	eight	to	nine	percent	.
and	that	 make 	 s 	 	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
when	india	was	growing	at	about	three	,	3.5	percent	and	the	population	was	growing	at	two	percent	,	 it 	 s 	 	per	capita	income	was	 doub 	 ling 	 	every	45	 year 	 s 	 	.
when	the	economic	growth	 go 	 es 	 	to	eight	percent	and	population	growth	 drop 	 s 	 	to	1.5	percent	,	then	per	capita	income	is	 doub 	 ling 	 	every	nine	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	you	're	 certain 	 ly 	 	fast	-	 forward 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	process	of	a	billion	people	going	to	 prosper 	 ity 	 	.
and	you	must	have	a	clear	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	which	is	 import 	 ant 	 	for	india	and	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	world	.
that	is	why	i	think	all	of	you	should	be	 equal 	 ly 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	it	 a 	 s 	 	i	am	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
