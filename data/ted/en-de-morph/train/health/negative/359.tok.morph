 a 	 side 	 	from	 keep 	 ing 	 	the	rain	out	and	producing	some	 us 	 able 	 	space	,	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	a	special	-	 effect 	 s 	 	machine	that	delights	and	disturbs	the	 sense 	 s 	 	.
our	work	is	 a 	 cross 	 	media	.	the	work	 come 	 s 	 	in	all	 shape 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	.
it	's	small	and	large	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	ashtray	,	a	water	glass	.
from	urban	 plan 	 ning 	 	and	master	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	theater	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
the	thing	that	all	the	work	 ha 	 s 	 	in	common	is	that	it	 challeng 	 es 	 	the	 assumption 	 s 	 	about	 convention 	 s 	 	of	space	.
and	these	are	 every 	 day 	 	 convention 	 s 	 	,	 convention 	 s 	 	that	are	so	obvious	that	we	are	 blind 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 familiar 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	've	 assemble 	 d 	 	a	 s 	 ampl 	 ing 	 	of	work	that	all	share	a	kind	of	productive	 nihil 	 ism 	 	that	's	used	in	the	service	of	creating	a	 part 	 icular 	 	special	effect	.
and	that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	next	to	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 d 	 one 	 	through	a	form	of	 subtract 	 ion 	 	or	 obstruct 	 ion 	 	or	 inter 	 ference 	 	in	a	world	that	we	 natural 	 ly 	 	sleepwalk	through	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	that	won	us	a	 com 	 petition 	 	for	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	pavilion	for	the	swiss	expo	2002	on	lake	neuchatel	,	near	geneva	.
and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	use	the	water	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 text 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	 prim 	 ary 	 	building	material	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	an	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	atmosphere	.
so	,	no	 wall 	 s 	 	,	no	roof	,	no	purpose	--	just	a	mass	of	 atom 	 ized 	 	water	,	a	big	cloud	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	proposal	was	a	 re 	 action 	 	to	the	over	-	 s 	 atur 	 ation 	 	of	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	in	 re 	 cent 	 	national	and	world	expositions	,	which	 feed 	 s 	 	,	or	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	our	 in 	 sati 	 able 	 	 appetit 	 e 	 	for	visual	 stimul 	 ation 	 	with	an	ever	 great 	 er 	 	digital	 virtuos 	 ity 	 	.
high	definition	,	in	our	opinion	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	the	new	 orthodox 	 y 	 	.
and	we	ask	the	question	,	can	we	use	technology	,	high	technology	,	to	make	an	expo	pavilion	that	's	 decide 	 d 	 ly 	 	low	definition	,	that	 al 	 so 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	the	 convention 	 s 	 	of	space	and	skin	,	and	 re 	 think 	 s 	 	our	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	vision	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	 s 	 ought 	 	to	do	it	.
water	's	 pump 	 ed 	 	from	the	lake	and	is	 filter 	 ed 	 	and	shot	 a 	 s 	 	a	fine	 mis 	 t 	 	through	an	array	of	high	-	pressure	fog	nozzles	,	35,000	of	them	.	and	a	weather	station	is	on	the	structure	.
it	 read 	 s 	 	the	shifting	 condition 	 s 	 	of	temperature	,	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	,	wind	direction	,	wind	speed	,	dew	point	,	and	it	 process 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	data	in	a	central	computer	that	calibrates	the	degree	of	water	pressure	and	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	water	 through 	 out 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 respons 	 ive 	 	system	that	's	trained	on	actual	weather	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	in	construction	,	and	there	's	a	tensegrity	structure	.
it	's	about	300	feet	wide	,	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	field	,	and	it	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	just	four	 ver 	 y 	 	 delic 	 ate 	 	 column 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	fog	nozzles	,	the	 inter 	 face 	 	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	system	is	kind	of	 read 	 ing 	 	the	real	weather	,	and	producing	kind	of	semi	-	artificial	and	real	weather	.
so	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	creating	weather	.	i	do	n't	know	why	.
now	,	here	we	go	,	one	side	,	the	 out 	 side 	 	and	then	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	space	you	can	see	what	the	quality	of	the	space	was	.
 un 	 like 	 	 enter 	 ing 	 	any	normal	space	,	 enter 	 ing 	 	blur	is	like	 step 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 habit 	 able 	 	medium	.
it	's	formless	,	featureless	,	depthless	,	scaleless	,	 mass 	 less 	 	,	purposeless	and	 dimension 	 less 	 	.
all	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	are	 era 	 s 	 ed 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	an	optical	 white 	 out 	 	and	white	noise	of	the	 puls 	 ing 	 	nozzles	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	pavilion	where	there	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	see	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
and	we	 pri 	 de 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	it	's	a	spectacular	anti	-	 spect 	 acle 	 	in	which	all	the	 convention 	 s 	 	of	 spect 	 acle 	 	are	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	head	.
so	,	the	audience	is	 dispers 	 ed 	 	,	focused	attention	and	 dramat 	 ic 	 	build	-	up	and	climax	are	all	 replace 	 d 	 	by	a	kind	of	attenuated	attention	that	's	 sustain 	 ed 	 	by	a	sense	of	 apprehens 	 ion 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	the	fog	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	how	the	victorian	novel	used	fog	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
so	here	the	world	is	put	out	of	focus	,	while	our	visual	 depend 	 ence 	 	is	put	 in 	 to 	 	focus	.
the	public	,	you	know	,	once	 dis 	 oriented 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	ascend	to	the	angel	deck	above	and	then	just	come	down	under	 t 	 hose 	 	lips	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	bar	.
so	,	all	the	 water 	 s 	 	of	the	world	are	 serv 	 ed 	 	there	,	so	we	thought	that	,	you	know	,	after	 be 	 ing 	 	at	the	water	and	moving	through	the	water	and	 breath 	 ing 	 	the	water	,	you	could	 al 	 so 	 	drink	 th 	 is 	 	building	.
and	so	it	is	sort	of	a	theme	,	but	it	 go 	 es 	 	a	little	bit	,	you	know	,	 deep 	 er 	 	than	that	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	out	our	absolute	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	master	sense	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	share	our	kind	of	 sens 	 ibility 	 	with	our	other	 sense 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	when	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	project	it	was	a	kind	of	tough	sell	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	swiss	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	why	are	we	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	,	you	know	,	10	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	producing	an	effect	that	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	in	natural	abundance	that	we	hate	?	``
and	,	you	know	,	we	thought	--	well	,	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	them	.
and	in	the	end	,	you	know	,	they	 adapt 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	national	icon	that	came	to	represent	swiss	doubt	,	which	we	--	you	know	,	it	was	kind	of	a	meaning	machine	that	 every 	 body 	 	kind	of	laid	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 meaning 	 s 	 	off	of	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	it	's	a	 tempor 	 ary 	 	structure	that	was	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	,	and	so	it	's	now	a	 memor 	 y 	 	of	an	 appar 	 ition 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	but	it	 continu 	 es 	 	to	live	in	 ed 	 ible 	 	form	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	highest	honor	to	be	bestowed	 up 	 on 	 	an	architect	in	switzerland	--	to	have	a	chocolate	bar	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	moving	 a 	 long 	 	.
so	in	the	'80s	and	'90s	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	known	for	 in 	 dependent 	 	work	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	artist	,	architect	,	 commission 	 ed 	 	 project 	 s 	 	by	 museum 	 s 	 	and	non	-	for	-	profit	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
and	we	did	a	lot	of	media	work	,	 al 	 so 	 	a	lot	of	 experiment 	 al 	 	theater	 project 	 s 	 	.
in	2003	,	the	whitney	 mount 	 ed 	 	a	 retrospect 	 ive 	 	of	our	work	that	 feature 	 d 	 	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	from	the	'80s	and	'90s	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	work	 it 	 self 	 	 resist 	 ed 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	of	a	 retrospect 	 ive 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	some	of	the	stuff	that	was	in	the	show	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	piece	on	 tour 	 ism 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	``	soft	sell	``	for	42nd	street	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	at	the	cartier	 found 	 ation 	 	.
``	master	/	slave	``	at	the	moma	,	the	project	 s 	 eries 	 	,	a	piece	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 parasit 	 e 	 	.	``
and	so	there	 we 	 re 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	they	 g 	 ave 	 	us	the	whole	fourth	floor	,	and	,	you	know	,	the	problem	of	the	 retrospect 	 ive 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	.
it	's	a	kind	of	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	museum	that	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	kind	of	 cohes 	 ive 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	to	the	public	of	a	body	of	work	.
and	our	work	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 re 	 solve 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	body	in	any	way	at	all	.
and	one	of	the	 recur 	 ring 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	,	that	in	the	work	was	a	kind	of	 hostil 	 ity 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	museum	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	about	the	 convention 	 s 	 	of	the	museum	,	like	the	wall	,	the	white	wall	.
so	,	what	you	see	here	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	plan	of	 man 	 y 	 	 install 	 ations 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	put	there	.
and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	to	install	white	 wall 	 s 	 	to	 separat 	 e 	 	these	 piece 	 s 	 	,	which	did	n't	belong	together	.
but	these	white	 wall 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	kind	of	target	and	weapon	at	the	same	time	.
we	used	the	wall	to	 part 	 ition 	 	the	13	 install 	 ations 	 	of	the	project	and	produce	a	kind	of	acoustic	and	visual	 separat 	 ion 	 	.
and	what	you	see	is	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	red	 dot 	 ted 	 	line	 show 	 s 	 	the	track	of	 th 	 is 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	element	,	which	was	a	new	piece	that	 create 	 d 	 	--	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	for	the	--	which	was	a	robotic	drill	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	that	went	all	the	way	around	,	cruised	the	museum	,	went	all	around	the	 wall 	 s 	 	and	did	a	lot	of	damage	.
so	,	the	drill	was	 mount 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	robotic	arm	.
we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	,	by	the	way	,	 honey 	 bee 	 	 robotic 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	brain	.
 honey 	 bee 	 	 robotic 	 s 	 	designed	the	mars	driller	,	and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 f 	 un 	 	to	work	with	them	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	work	,	which	was	for	the	government	,	while	they	 we 	 re 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	us	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	any	case	,	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	that	an	intelligent	 navig 	 ator 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 map 	 s 	 	the	entire	surface	of	these	 wall 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 un 	 fold 	 ed 	 	it	's	about	300	linear	feet	.
and	it	 random 	 ly 	 	 generate 	 s 	 	 point 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	three	-	dimensional	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
it	 select 	 s 	 	a	point	,	it	 guide 	 s 	 	the	drill	to	that	point	,	it	 pierc 	 es 	 	the	dry	wall	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	a	half	-	inch	hole	before	 travel 	 ing 	 	to	the	next	location	.
 initi 	 ally 	 	these	 hole 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	lone	blemishes	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	the	 wall 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 perfo 	 rated 	 	.
so	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	wall	 align 	 ed 	 	,	 open 	 ing 	 	 view 	 s 	 	from	 gall 	 ery 	 	to	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
 cluster 	 s 	 	of	 hole 	 s 	 	 random 	 ly 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	up	 section 	 s 	 	of	wall	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	three	-	month	performance	piece	in	which	the	wall	was	made	 in 	 to 	 	kind	of	an	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	element	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	the	acoustic	 separat 	 ion 	 	was	 destroy 	 ed 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	the	visual	 separat 	 ion 	 	.
and	there	was	 al 	 so 	 	 th 	 is 	 	constant	 back 	 ground 	 	groan	,	which	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 annoy 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 black 	 out 	 	 space 	 s 	 	where	there	's	a	video	piece	that	 be 	 came 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	not	 use 	 ful 	 	.
so	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 secu 	 ring 	 	a	neutral	 back 	 ground 	 	for	the	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	on	 dis 	 play 	 	,	the	wall	now	 active 	 ly 	 	 compete 	 d 	 	for	attention	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 acoustic 	 al 	 	 nuis 	 ance 	 	and	visual	 nuis 	 ance 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	the	 dis 	 comfort 	 	of	the	work	to	 th 	 is 	 	 en 	 compass 	 ing 	 	nature	of	the	 retrospect 	 ive 	 	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	great	when	it	 start 	 ed 	 	to	break	up	all	of	the	curatorial	text	.
moving	 a 	 long 	 	to	a	project	that	we	 finish 	 ed 	 	about	a	year	ago	.
it	's	the	ica	--	the	institute	of	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	--	in	boston	,	which	is	on	the	 water 	 front 	 	.
and	there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	time	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 introduc 	 e 	 	the	building	,	but	i	'll	 simpl 	 y 	 	say	that	the	building	 negoti 	 ates 	 	between	 th 	 is 	 	 out 	 ward 	 ly 	 	focused	nature	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	--	you	know	,	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 water 	 front 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	in	boston	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	 contradict 	 ory 	 	other	 desir 	 e 	 	to	have	an	 in 	 ward 	 ly 	 	focused	museum	.
so	,	the	nature	of	the	building	is	that	it	 look 	 s 	 	at	looking	--	i	mean	that	's	 it 	 s 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	 object 	 ive 	 	,	both	 it 	 s 	 	program	and	 it 	 s 	 	 architect 	 ural 	 	 conce 	 it 	 	.
the	building	 in 	 corporate 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	but	it	dispenses	it	in	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 dose 	 s 	 	in	the	way	that	the	museum	is	 choreograph 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	you	come	in	and	you	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 squeez 	 ed 	 	by	the	theater	,	by	the	 bel 	 ly 	 	of	the	theater	,	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 compress 	 ed 	 	space	where	the	view	is	 turn 	 ed 	 	off	.
then	you	come	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	glass	 elev 	 ator 	 	right	near	the	 cur 	 tain 	 	wall	.
 th 	 is 	 	 elev 	 ator 	 	's	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	new	york	city	studio	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
and	then	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	view	going	up	,	and	then	you	could	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	theater	,	which	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 den 	 y 	 	the	view	or	open	it	up	and	 be 	 come 	 	a	 back 	 drop 	 	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	 music 	 ians 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	to	use	the	theater	glass	 wall 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	open	.
the	view	is	 deni 	 ed 	 	in	the	 gall 	 eries 	 	where	we	 receiv 	 e 	 	just	natural	light	,	and	then	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	the	north	 gall 	 ery 	 	with	a	 pan 	 ora 	 mic 	 	view	.
the	original	 intent 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	space	,	which	was	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	never	 real 	 ized 	 	,	was	to	use	 lent 	 icular 	 	glass	which	 allow 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	kind	of	 per 	 pend 	 icular 	 	view	out	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	narrow	space	that	 connect 	 s 	 	east	and	west	 gall 	 eries 	 	the	 intent 	 ion 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	to	not	get	a	climax	,	but	to	have	the	view	 s 	 talk 	 	you	,	so	the	view	would	open	up	 a 	 s 	 	you	 walk 	 ed 	 	from	one	end	to	the	other	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 eliminate 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	view	was	too	good	,	and	the	mayor	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	we	just	want	 th 	 is 	 	open	.	``
the	architect	lost	here	.
but	 culmin 	 ating 	 	--	and	that	's	where	 th 	 is 	 	 hook 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	theme	of	my	little	talk	--	is	 th 	 is 	 	mediatheque	,	which	is	 suspend 	 ed 	 	from	the	 c 	 anti 	 lever 	 ed 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	of	the	building	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	80	-	foot	cantilever	--	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 sub 	 stantial 	 	.
so	,	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	space	 en 	 ough 	 	,	and	then	from	that	is	 th 	 is 	 	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	small	area	 call 	 ed 	 	the	mediatheque	.
the	mediatheque	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	16	 station 	 s 	 	where	the	public	can	get	onto	the	 serv 	 er 	 	and	look	at	digital	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	or	 al 	 so 	 	 cur 	 ated 	 	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	off	the	web	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	a	kind	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	and	here	is	a	point	where	 architect 	 ure 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	technology	-	free	--	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	a	framing	 de 	 vice 	 	,	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 edit 	 s 	 	the	harbor	view	,	the	industrial	harbor	just	through	 it 	 s 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	 floor 	 s 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	to	 on 	 ly 	 	 ex 	 pose 	 	the	water	 it 	 self 	 	,	the	 text 	 ure 	 	of	water	,	much	like	a	 hypno 	 tic 	 	effect	 create 	 d 	 	by	 electron 	 ic 	 	snow	or	a	lava	lamp	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
and	here	is	where	we	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	that	there	was	a	great	 converg 	 ence 	 	of	the	 techno 	 logical 	 	and	the	natural	in	the	project	.
but	there	is	just	no	information	,	it	's	just	--	it	's	just	hypnosis	.
moving	 a 	 long 	 	to	lincoln	center	.
these	are	the	 guy 	 s 	 	that	did	the	project	in	the	first	place	,	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	're	taking	over	now	,	 do 	 ing 	 	work	that	 range 	 s 	 	in	scale	from	small	-	scale	 repair 	 s 	 	to	major	 ren 	 ov 	 ations 	 	and	major	 facil 	 ity 	 	 expansion 	 s 	 	.
but	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	with	a	lot	less	testosterone	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	of	the	work	that	's	to	be	 complete 	 d 	 	by	2010	.
and	for	the	 purpose 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	isolate	just	a	part	of	a	project	that	's	even	a	part	of	a	project	that	 touch 	 es 	 	a	little	bit	on	 th 	 is 	 	theme	of	 architect 	 ural 	 	special	 effect 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	our	current	obsession	,	and	it	 play 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	with	the	 pur 	 ging 	 	and	 add 	 ing 	 	of	 distract 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	alice	tully	hall	,	and	it	's	 tuck 	 ed 	 	under	the	juilliard	building	and	 descend 	 s 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 level 	 s 	 	under	the	street	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 en 	 trance 	 	to	tully	hall	 a 	 s 	 	it	used	to	be	,	before	the	renovation	,	which	we	just	 start 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	why	could	n't	it	be	exhibitionistic	,	like	the	met	,	or	like	some	of	the	other	 building 	 s 	 	at	lincoln	center	?
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	give	it	a	street	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	expand	the	 lobbi 	 es 	 	and	make	it	 visual 	 ly 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	which	is	just	 natural 	 ly 	 	 her 	 me 	 tic 	 	,	we	 strip 	 ped 	 	.
we	 bas 	 ically 	 	did	a	striptease	,	 architect 	 ural 	 	striptease	,	where	we	're	framing	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 can 	 opy 	 	--	the	 under 	 side 	 	of	three	 level 	 s 	 	of	expansion	of	juilliard	,	about	45,000	square	feet	--	cutting	it	to	the	angle	of	broadway	,	and	then	 ex 	 posing 	 	,	using	that	 can 	 opy 	 	to	frame	tully	hall	.
before	and	after	shot	.
wait	a	minute	,	it	's	just	in	that	state	,	we	have	a	long	way	to	go	.
but	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	take	a	couple	of	 second 	 s 	 	that	i	have	left	to	just	talk	about	the	hall	 it 	 self 	 	,	which	is	kind	of	where	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	massive	amount	of	work	.
so	,	the	hall	is	a	multi	-	purpose	hall	.
the	 client 	 s 	 	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	produce	a	great	chamber	music	hall	.
now	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	tough	to	do	with	a	hall	that	 ha 	 s 	 	1,100	 seat 	 s 	 	.
chamber	and	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	chamber	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 s 	 al 	 on 	 s 	 	and	small	-	scale	 performance 	 s 	 	.	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	 br 	 ing 	 	an	 in 	 timacy 	 	.
how	do	you	 br 	 ing 	 	an	 in 	 timacy 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	hall	?
 in 	 timacy 	 	for	us	 mean 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	acoustic	 in 	 timacy 	 	and	it	 mean 	 s 	 	visual	 in 	 timacy 	 	.
one	thing	is	that	the	 sub 	 way 	 	is	running	and	rumbling	right	under	the	hall	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	could	be	 fix 	 ed 	 	is	the	shape	of	the	hall	.
it	's	like	a	coffin	,	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	all	the	sound	,	like	a	 gutt 	 er 	 	-	ball	effect	,	down	the	 aisle 	 s 	 	.
the	 wall 	 s 	 	are	made	of	absorptive	surface	,	half	absorptive	,	half	 reflect 	 ive 	 	,	which	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	concert	sound	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	avery	 fish 	 er 	 	hall	,	but	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	junk	--	visual	junk	--	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	,	to	get	rid	of	visual	noise	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	ca	n't	eliminate	a	single	seat	,	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	 restrict 	 ed 	 	to	18	 inch 	 es 	 	.
so	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
first	we	do	a	kind	of	partial	box	and	box	 separat 	 ion 	 	,	to	take	away	the	 distract 	 ion 	 	of	the	 sub 	 way 	 	noise	.
next	we	wrap	the	entire	hall	--	 al 	 most 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	olivetti	 key 	 board 	 	--	with	a	material	,	with	a	wood	material	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	 cover 	 s 	 	all	the	 surface 	 s 	 	:	wall	,	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	floor	,	stage	,	 step 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	,	boxes	.
but	it	's	 acoustic 	 ally 	 	engineered	to	focus	the	sound	 in 	 to 	 	the	house	and	back	to	the	stage	.	and	here	's	an	acoustic	shelf	.
looking	up	the	hall	.	just	a	section	of	the	stage	.
just	 every 	 thing 	 	is	lined	,	it	 in 	 corporate 	 s 	 	--	every	single	thing	that	you	could	possibly	imagine	is	 tuck 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	high	-	performance	skin	.
but	one	more	 add 	 ed 	 	feature	.
so	now	that	we	've	 strip 	 ped 	 	the	hall	of	all	visual	 distract 	 ion 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 prevent 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 timacy 	 	which	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	connect	the	house	,	the	audience	,	with	the	 perform 	 ers 	 	,	we	add	one	little	detail	,	one	piece	of	 architect 	 ural 	 	excess	,	a	special	effect	:	 light 	 ing 	 	.
we	 ver 	 y 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	theatrics	of	a	concert	hall	is	 a 	 s 	 	much	in	the	space	of	 inter 	 mission 	 	and	the	space	of	 arriv 	 al 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	when	the	concert	 start 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	produce	 th 	 is 	 	effect	,	 th 	 is 	 	 light 	 ing 	 	effect	,	which	made	us	have	to	bioengineer	the	wood	 wall 	 s 	 	.
and	what	it	 en 	 tail 	 s 	 	is	the	use	of	 re 	 s 	 in 	 	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	thick	 re 	 s 	 in 	 	with	a	 vene 	 er 	 	of	the	same	kind	of	wood	that	's	used	 through 	 out 	 	the	hall	,	in	a	kind	of	 seam 	 less 	 	 continu 	 ity 	 	that	 wrap 	 s 	 	the	hall	in	light	,	like	a	belt	of	light	:	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 separat 	 ing 	 	,	like	a	 pro 	 scen 	 ium 	 	would	 separat 	 e 	 	the	audience	from	 perform 	 ers 	 	,	it	 connect 	 s 	 	audience	with	 player 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	mockup	that	is	in	salt	lake	city	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	sense	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	look	like	in	full	-	scale	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	guy	from	salt	lake	city	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	look	like	out	there	.
and	for	us	,	i	mean	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	thing	,	but	the	 moment 	 s 	 	in	the	hall	that	the	buzz	kind	of	dies	down	when	the	audience	is	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	performance	to	begin	,	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	the	 part 	 ing 	 	of	 cur 	 tain 	 s 	 	or	the	raising	of	a	 chan 	 deli 	 er 	 	,	the	 wall 	 s 	 	will	just	exude	 th 	 is 	 	glow	,	 tempor 	 arily 	 	 steal 	 ing 	 	attention	from	the	stage	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	tully	in	construction	now	.
i	have	no	 end 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	i	'm	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	over	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
