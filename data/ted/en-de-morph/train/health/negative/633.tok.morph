these	are	grim	economic	 time 	 s 	 	,	fellow	tedsters	,	grim	economic	 time 	 s 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	,	i	would	like	to	cheer	you	up	with	one	of	the	great	,	albeit	 large 	 ly 	 	 un 	 known 	 	,	commercial	success	 st 	 ories 	 	of	the	past	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
 compar 	 able 	 	,	in	 it 	 s 	 	own	 ver 	 y 	 	peculiar	way	,	to	the	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 soft 	 	or	google	.
and	it	's	an	industry	which	 ha 	 s 	 	bucked	the	current	 recess 	 ion 	 	with	 equ 	 anim 	 ity 	 	.
i	refer	to	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	.
now	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	,	i	hear	you	say	,	and	these	would	be	wise	 word 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
but	in	the	last	two	 decade 	 s 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	an	unprecedented	expansion	,	now	 account 	 ing 	 	for	 rough 	 ly 	 	15	percent	of	the	world	's	gdp	.
i	like	to	call	it	the	global	shadow	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	or	mcmafia	,	for	short	.
so	what	 trigger 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	growth	in	cross	-	border	crime	?
well	,	of	course	,	there	is	 global 	 ization 	 	,	technology	,	 communication 	 s 	 	,	all	that	stuff	,	which	we	'll	talk	about	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	.
but	first	,	i	would	like	to	take	you	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	event	:	the	collapse	of	 commun 	 ism 	 	.
all	 a 	 cross 	 	eastern	europe	,	a	most	 moment 	 ous 	 	episode	in	our	post	-	war	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
now	it	's	time	for	full	 dis 	 closure 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	event	 me 	 ant 	 	a	great	deal	to	me	 personal 	 ly 	 	.
i	had	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 mug 	 gling 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	iron	 cur 	 tain 	 	to	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 op 	 position 	 	 group 	 s 	 	in	eastern	europe	,	like	 solid 	 arity 	 	in	poland	,	when	i	was	in	my	 teen 	 s 	 	.
i	then	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	about	eastern	europe	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	i	 be 	 came 	 	the	bbc	's	chief	 correspond 	 ent 	 	for	the	region	,	which	is	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	in	1989	.
and	so	when	425	million	people	 final 	 ly 	 	won	the	right	to	 choos 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 government 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 ec 	 static 	 	,	but	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	touch	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	some	of	the	 na 	 s 	 tier 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 lurk 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	wall	.
it	was	n't	long	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	before	ethnic	 national 	 ism 	 	 rear 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 blood 	 y 	 	head	in	yugoslavia	.
and	 among 	 st 	 	the	 cha 	 os 	 	,	 a 	 mid 	 st 	 	the	euphoria	,	it	took	me	a	little	while	to	understand	that	some	of	the	people	who	had	wielded	power	before	1989	,	in	eastern	europe	,	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	do	so	after	the	 revolution 	 s 	 	there	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 character 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	some	more	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	people	who	 play 	 ed 	 	a	critical	role	in	what	was	going	on	in	eastern	europe	.
like	 th 	 is 	 	character	.	remember	these	 guy 	 s 	 	?
they	used	to	win	the	gold	 med 	 al 	 s 	 	in	 weight 	 lift 	 ing 	 	and	 wrestl 	 ing 	 	,	every	four	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	olympics	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	great	 celebr 	 ities 	 	of	 commun 	 ism 	 	,	with	a	fabulous	 life 	 style 	 	to	go	with	it	.
they	used	to	get	great	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	in	the	center	of	town	,	casual	 s 	 ex 	 	on	tap	,	and	they	could	travel	to	the	west	 ver 	 y 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	,	which	was	a	great	 luxur 	 y 	 	at	the	time	.
it	may	come	 a 	 s 	 	a	surprise	,	but	they	 play 	 ed 	 	a	critical	role	in	the	emergence	of	the	market	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	eastern	europe	.
or	 a 	 s 	 	i	like	to	call	them	,	they	are	the	 mid 	 wives 	 	of	 capital 	 ism 	 	.
here	are	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	same	weightlifters	after	 the 	 ir 	 	1989	 make 	 over 	 	.
now	in	bulgaria	--	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	was	taken	in	bulgaria	--	when	 commun 	 ism 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	all	over	eastern	europe	,	it	was	n't	just	 commun 	 ism 	 	;	it	was	the	state	that	 collapse 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	your	police	force	was	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	.
the	court	system	was	n't	 function 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
so	what	was	a	business	man	in	the	brave	new	world	of	east	european	 capital 	 ism 	 	going	to	do	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	his	 contract 	 s 	 	would	be	 honor 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	he	would	turn	to	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	 prosaic 	 ally 	 	by	 socio 	 logists 	 	,	 privat 	 ized 	 	law	 enforce 	 ment 	 	 age 	 ncies 	 	.
we	prefer	to	know	them	 a 	 s 	 	the	mafia	.
and	in	bulgaria	,	the	mafia	was	soon	 join 	 ed 	 	with	14,000	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	sacked	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	in	the	security	 service 	 s 	 	between	1989	and	1991	.
now	,	when	your	state	is	 col 	 lap 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	your	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 head 	 ing 	 	south	at	a	rate	of	 knot 	 s 	 	,	the	last	people	you	want	coming	on	to	the	labor	market	are	14,000	men	and	women	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	chief	 skill 	 s 	 	are	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	,	are	 s 	 mug 	 gling 	 	,	building	 under 	 ground 	 	 network 	 s 	 	and	 kill 	 ing 	 	people	.
but	that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	all	over	eastern	europe	.
now	,	when	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	1990s	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	most	of	the	time	 cover 	 ing 	 	the	 app 	 all 	 ing 	 	conflict	in	yugoslavia	.
and	i	could	n't	help	notice	that	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 perpet 	 rating 	 	the	 app 	 all 	 ing 	 	 atro 	 cities 	 	,	the	paramilitary	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	same	people	running	the	 organize 	 d 	 	criminal	syndicates	.
and	i	came	to	think	that	 be 	 hind 	 	the	violence	lay	a	 s 	 ini 	 ster 	 	criminal	enterprise	.
and	so	i	resolved	to	travel	around	the	world	 exa 	 min 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	global	criminal	 under 	 world 	 	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 police 	 men 	 	,	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 victim 	 s 	 	,	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 consumer 	 s 	 	of	 illi 	 cit 	 	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	.
but	above	all	else	,	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	 gang 	 sters 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	the	balkans	was	a	fabulous	place	to	start	.
why	?	well	of	course	there	was	the	issue	of	law	and	order	 col 	 lap 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	say	in	the	 re 	 tail 	 	trade	,	it	's	location	,	location	,	location	.
and	what	i	 notice 	 d 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	my	research	that	the	balkans	had	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	vast	transit	zone	for	 illi 	 cit 	 	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	coming	from	all	over	the	world	.
 hero 	 in 	 	,	 coca 	 ine 	 	,	women	 be 	 ing 	 	 traffic 	 ked 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	and	precious	 mineral 	 s 	 	.
and	where	 we 	 re 	 	they	 head 	 ing 	 	?
the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	,	which	by	now	was	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	reap	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 global 	 ization 	 	,	 transform 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	most	 af 	 fluent 	 	consumer	market	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	comprising	some	500	million	people	.
and	a	significant	 minor 	 ity 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	500	million	people	like	to	 s 	 pend 	 	some	of	 the 	 ir 	 	leisure	time	and	spare	cash	 sleep 	 ing 	 	with	 prostitute 	 s 	 	,	 stick 	 ing 	 	50	euro	 note 	 s 	 	up	 the 	 ir 	 	nose	and	 employ 	 ing 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	migrant	 labor 	 ers 	 	.
now	,	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	in	a	 global 	 izing 	 	world	 oper 	 ates 	 	in	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	any	other	business	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 zone 	 s 	 	of	production	,	like	afghanistan	and	columbia	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 zone 	 s 	 	of	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	like	mexico	and	the	balkans	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 zone 	 s 	 	of	consumption	,	like	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	,	japan	and	of	course	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
the	 zone 	 s 	 	of	production	and	 distribut 	 ion 	 	tend	to	lie	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	and	they	are	often	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	 app 	 all 	 ing 	 	violence	and	 blood 	 shed 	 	.
take	mexico	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
six	thousand	people	 kill 	 ed 	 	there	in	the	last	18	 month 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	direct	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	the	 coca 	 ine 	 	trade	.
but	what	about	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 re 	 public 	 	of	congo	?
since	1998	,	five	million	people	have	 di 	 ed 	 	there	.
it	's	not	a	conflict	you	read	about	much	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	the	 big 	 gest 	 	conflict	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	since	the	second	world	war	.
and	why	is	it	?	 be 	 cause 	 	 mafia 	 s 	 	from	all	around	the	world	cooperate	with	local	paramilitaries	in	order	to	 s 	 e 	 ize 	 	the	 suppli 	 es 	 	of	the	rich	mineral	 resource 	 s 	 	of	the	region	.
in	the	year	2000	,	80	percent	of	the	world	's	 col 	 tan 	 	was	sourced	to	the	 kill 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	of	the	eastern	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 re 	 public 	 	of	congo	.
now	,	 col 	 tan 	 	you	will	find	in	 al 	 most 	 	every	mobile	phone	,	in	 al 	 most 	 	every	 lap 	 top 	 	and	 game 	 s 	 	 consol 	 e 	 	.
the	congolese	war	 lord 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	selling	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	to	the	mafia	in	 ex 	 change 	 	for	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	and	the	mafia	would	then	sell	it	on	to	western	 market 	 s 	 	.
and	it	is	 th 	 is 	 	western	 desir 	 e 	 	to	 consum 	 e 	 	that	is	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	driver	of	 inter 	 national 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	.
now	,	let	me	show	you	some	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	in	action	,	caught	 convenient 	 ly 	 	on	film	by	the	italian	police	,	and	 s 	 mug 	 gling 	 	duty	-	not	-	paid	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	out	the	 factor 	 y 	 	gate	are	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	.
the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	then	 impose 	 s 	 	the	highest	 tax 	 es 	 	on	them	in	the	world	.
so	if	you	can	smuggle	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	e.u	.	,	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 hand 	 some 	 	 profit 	 s 	 	to	be	made	,	and	i	want	to	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	the	type	of	 resource 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	these	 group 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	boat	is	worth	one	million	 eur 	 os 	 	when	it	's	new	.
and	it	's	the	 fast 	 est 	 	thing	on	european	 water 	 s 	 	.
from	1994	,	for	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	20	of	these	 boat 	 s 	 	made	the	trip	 a 	 cross 	 	the	adriatic	,	from	montenegro	to	italy	,	every	single	night	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	trade	,	britain	 al 	 one 	 	lost	eight	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	revenue	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	that	money	went	to	 under 	 write 	 	the	 war 	 s 	 	in	yugoslavia	and	line	the	 pocket 	 s 	 	of	unscrupulous	 individual 	 s 	 	.
now	italian	police	,	when	 th 	 is 	 	trade	 start 	 ed 	 	,	had	just	two	 boat 	 s 	 	which	could	go	at	the	same	speed	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	you	can	catch	these	 guy 	 s 	 	is	if	they	run	out	of	gas	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 gang 	 sters 	 	would	 br 	 ing 	 	with	them	women	 be 	 ing 	 	 traffic 	 ked 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	,	and	if	the	police	 inter 	 vene 	 d 	 	,	they	would	hurl	the	women	 in 	 to 	 	the	sea	so	that	the	police	had	to	go	and	 s 	 ave 	 	them	from	 drown 	 ing 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	chasing	the	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	.
so	i	have	 show 	 n 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	 boat 	 s 	 	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 vessel 	 s 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	catch	one	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
and	the	answer	is	six	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
and	remember	,	20	of	these	speed	 boat 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	 a 	 cross 	 	the	adriatic	every	single	night	.
so	what	 we 	 re 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	with	all	the	money	they	 we 	 re 	 	making	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	come	to	 global 	 ization 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	was	not	just	the	 de 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	of	global	trade	.
it	was	the	 liberal 	 ization 	 	of	 inter 	 national 	 	financial	 market 	 s 	 	.
and	boy	,	did	that	make	it	easy	for	the	money	 launder 	 ers 	 	.
the	last	two	 decade 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	 champ 	 agne 	 	era	for	 dirt 	 y 	 	lucre	.
in	the	1990s	,	we	saw	financial	 center 	 s 	 	around	the	world	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	business	,	and	there	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	no	effective	 mechan 	 ism 	 	to	prevent	money	 launder 	 ing 	 	.
and	a	lot	of	licit	 bank 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	happy	to	accept	 deposit 	 s 	 	from	 ver 	 y 	 	 dub 	 ious 	 	 source 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 question 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
but	at	the	heart	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	is	the	 off 	 shore 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	network	.
now	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	an	essential	part	of	the	money	 launder 	 ing 	 	 para 	 de 	 	,	and	if	you	want	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 il 	 legal 	 	tax	 evas 	 ion 	 	and	 trans 	 national 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	,	money	 launder 	 ing 	 	,	you	have	to	get	rid	of	them	.
on	a	positive	note	,	we	at	last	have	 some 	 one 	 	in	the	white	house	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	spoken	out	against	these	 corros 	 ive 	 	 ent 	 ities 	 	.
and	if	 any 	 one 	 	is	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	is	the	 necess 	 ity 	 	for	new	 legisl 	 ation 	 	,	 regulat 	 ion 	 	,	effective	 regulat 	 ion 	 	,	i	say	,	let	's	take	a	look	at	bernie	madoff	,	who	is	now	going	to	be	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	the	rest	of	his	life	in	jail	.
bernie	madoff	stole	65	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
that	 put 	 s 	 	him	up	there	on	the	olympus	of	 gang 	 sters 	 	with	the	colombian	cartels	and	the	major	russian	crime	syndicates	,	but	he	did	 th 	 is 	 	for	 decade 	 s 	 	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	heart	of	wall	street	,	and	no	 regulat 	 or 	 	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	on	it	.
so	how	 man 	 y 	 	other	madoffs	are	there	on	wall	street	or	in	the	city	of	london	,	 flee 	 c 	 ing 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	folk	and	money	 launder 	 ing 	 	?
well	i	can	tell	you	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	of	them	.
let	me	go	on	to	the	101	of	 inter 	 national 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	now	.
and	that	is	narcotics	.	our	second	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	farm	photograph	for	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	is	in	central	british	columbia	where	i	 photograph 	 ed 	 	it	.
it	's	one	of	the	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	mom	-	and	-	pop	grow	-	ops	in	b.c	.
which	ensure	that	over	five	percent	of	the	 pro 	 vince 	 	's	gdp	is	 account 	 ed 	 	for	by	 th 	 is 	 	trade	.
now	,	i	was	taken	by	 inspect 	 or 	 	brian	cantera	,	of	the	royal	canadian	 mount 	 ed 	 	police	,	to	a	 cavern 	 ous 	 	 ware 	 house 	 	east	of	vancouver	to	see	some	of	the	 good 	 s 	 	which	are	 regular 	 ly 	 	 confisc 	 ated 	 	by	the	rcmp	from	the	smugglers	who	are	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	it	,	of	course	,	down	south	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	where	there	is	an	 in 	 sati 	 able 	 	market	for	b.c	.	bud	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	,	in	part	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 market 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	which	of	course	 go 	 es 	 	down	 ver 	 y 	 	well	in	california	.
now	,	even	by	the	police	's	 ad 	 mission 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	not	a	dent	in	the	 profit 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	of	the	major	 export 	 ers 	 	.
since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 global 	 ization 	 	,	the	global	narcotics	market	 ha 	 s 	 	 expand 	 ed 	 	 enormous 	 ly 	 	.
there	 ha 	 s 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	 be 	 en 	 	no	concomitant	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	 resource 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	police	 force 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	may	all	be	about	to	change	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	is	going	on	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	it	was	last	month	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	that	canada	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	key	area	of	 distribut 	 ion 	 	and	production	of	 ecstas 	 y 	 	and	other	synthetic	 drug 	 s 	 	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	the	market	share	of	 hero 	 in 	 	and	 coca 	 ine 	 	is	going	down	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 pill 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	ever	better	at	 re 	 producing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 high 	 s 	 	.
now	that	is	a	game	changer	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 shift 	 s 	 	production	away	from	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	western	world	.
when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	it	is	a	trend	which	is	set	to	overwhelm	our	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	in	the	west	.
the	 drug 	 s 	 	policy	which	we	've	had	in	place	for	40	 year 	 s 	 	is	long	 over 	 due 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	 re 	 think 	 	,	in	my	opinion	.
now	,	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
well	,	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	to	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
not	surprising	,	the	most	opportunistic	industry	in	the	whole	world	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 rule 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	 regulat 	 ory 	 	system	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	of	course	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	two	business	 risk 	 s 	 	:	arrest	by	law	 enforce 	 ment 	 	,	which	is	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	the	 l 	 east 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 worri 	 es 	 	,	and	 com 	 petition 	 	from	other	 group 	 s 	 	,	i.e	.	a	bullet	in	the	back	of	the	head	.
what	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	they	've	 shift 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	.
people	do	n't	smoke	 a 	 s 	 	much	 do 	 pe 	 	,	or	visit	 prostitute 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	so	 frequent 	 ly 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
and	so	 in 	 stead 	 	,	they	have	 invad 	 ed 	 	financial	and	corporate	crime	in	a	big	way	,	but	above	all	,	two	 sector 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	 counter 	 fe 	 it 	 	 good 	 s 	 	and	 cyber 	 crime 	 	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
i	would	like	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	mr.	pringle	.
or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	i	should	say	,	more	 accurate 	 ly 	 	,	señor	pringle	.
i	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	bit	of	kit	by	a	brazilian	 cyber 	 criminal 	 	.
we	 s 	 at 	 	in	a	car	on	the	 a 	 venue 	 	paulista	in	são	paulo	,	together	.
 hook 	 ed 	 	it	up	to	my	 lap 	 top 	 	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	about	five	 minute 	 s 	 	he	had	 penetrate 	 d 	 	the	computer	security	system	of	a	major	brazilian	bank	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	that	difficult	.
and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 fasci 	 nating 	 	thing	about	 cyber 	 crime 	 	is	that	it	's	not	so	much	the	technology	.
the	key	to	 cyber 	 crime 	 	is	what	we	call	social	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
or	to	use	the	technical	term	for	it	,	there	's	one	born	every	minute	.
you	would	not	 believ 	 e 	 	how	easy	it	is	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	people	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	which	are	 object 	 ively 	 	not	in	 the 	 ir 	 	interest	.
and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	when	the	 cyber 	 criminal 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	the	 quick 	 est 	 	way	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	the	 quick 	 est 	 	way	to	a	person	's	wallet	is	through	the	promise	of	 s 	 ex 	 	and	love	.
i	expect	some	of	you	remember	the	iloveyou	virus	,	one	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	great	 world 	 wide 	 	viruses	that	came	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	fortunate	when	the	iloveyou	virus	came	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	first	person	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	it	from	was	an	ex	-	girlfriend	of	mine	.
now	,	she	 harbor 	 ed 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 sentiment 	 s 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	me	at	the	time	,	but	love	was	not	 among 	 st 	 	them	.
and	so	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	drop	 in 	 to 	 	my	 in 	 box 	 	,	i	 dis 	 patch 	 ed 	 	it	hastily	to	the	 re 	 cycle 	 	bin	and	 s 	 par 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nasty	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	 cyber 	 crime 	 	,	do	watch	out	for	it	.
one	thing	that	we	do	know	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	is	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 assist 	 ing 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 mosquito 	 es 	 	who	carry	the	 malaria 	 l 	 	 parasit 	 e 	 	which	infests	our	blood	when	the	mosy	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	free	meal	at	our	expense	.
now	,	artesunate	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	drug	at	 destroy 	 ing 	 	the	 parasit 	 e 	 	in	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	of	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
but	over	the	past	year	or	so	,	 research 	 ers 	 	in	cambodia	have	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	the	 malaria 	 l 	 	 parasit 	 e 	 	is	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
and	they	fear	that	the	reason	why	it	's	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	 resist 	 ance 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	cambodians	ca	n't	afford	the	 drug 	 s 	 	on	the	commercial	market	,	and	so	they	buy	it	from	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	these	 pill 	 s 	 	contain	 on 	 ly 	 	low	 dose 	 s 	 	of	the	active	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	.
which	is	why	the	 parasit 	 e 	 	is	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	develop	a	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
the	reason	i	say	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	to	know	that	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	 impact 	 s 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 area 	 s 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
you	do	n't	have	to	sleep	with	 prostitute 	 s 	 	or	take	 drug 	 s 	 	in	order	to	have	a	relationship	with	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	.
they	affect	our	bank	 account 	 s 	 	.
they	affect	our	 communication 	 s 	 	,	our	pension	 fund 	 s 	 	.
they	even	affect	the	food	that	we	eat	and	our	 government 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	an	issue	of	sicilians	from	palermo	and	new	york	.
there	is	no	 rom 	 ance 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	 gang 	 sters 	 	in	the	21st	century	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 might 	 y 	 	industry	,	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	 in 	 st 	 ability 	 	and	violence	 where 	 ver 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
it	is	a	major	economic	force	and	we	need	to	take	it	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	privilege	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
