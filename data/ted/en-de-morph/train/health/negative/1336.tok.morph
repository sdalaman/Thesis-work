 yea 	 h 	 	,	so	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	was	 turn 	 ing 	 	60	,	and	i	do	n't	like	 be 	 ing 	 	60	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 grappl 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	existential	 ang 	 st 	 	of	what	little	i	had	 d 	 one 	 	with	my	life	.
it	was	n't	the	resume	of	 break 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	record	here	,	it	was	more	like	,	who	had	i	 be 	 come 	 	?
how	had	i	 s 	 pent 	 	my	 valu 	 able 	 	time	?
how	could	 th 	 is 	 	have	gone	by	like	 light 	 ning 	 	?
and	i	could	n't	forgive	 my 	 self 	 	for	the	 count 	 less 	 	,	 count 	 less 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	i	had	lost	in	negative	thought	--	all	the	time	i	had	 s 	 pent 	 	 beat 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	up	for	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	my	marriage	and	not	 stop 	 ping 	 	the	sexual	abuse	when	i	was	a	kid	and	 care 	 er 	 	 move 	 s 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	.
just	why	,	why	did	n't	i	do	it	better	?	why	?	why	?	why	?
and	then	my	mother	 di 	 ed 	 	at	82	.
and	so	i	 start 	 ing 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	am	i	not	happy	with	the	past	,	now	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	 choke 	 d 	 	with	,	``	i	've	 on 	 ly 	 	got	22	 year 	 s 	 	left	.	``
what	am	i	going	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	short	amount	of	time	that	's	just	 fleet 	 ing 	 	?
and	i	'm	not	in	the	present	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	the	 re 	 med 	 y 	 	to	all	 th 	 is 	 	 mal 	 a 	 ise 	 	was	going	to	be	for	me	to	chase	an	 elev 	 ated 	 	dream	,	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	dream	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	 requir 	 e 	 	utter	 convict 	 ion 	 	and	 un 	 wave 	 ring 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	make	me	be	my	best	self	in	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	my	life	,	every	minute	of	every	day	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	dream	was	so	big	that	i	could	n't	get	there	 with 	 out 	 	that	kind	of	behavior	and	that	kind	of	 convict 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	,	it	was	an	old	dream	that	was	 linger 	 ing 	 	,	that	was	from	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	three	 decade 	 s 	 	ago	--	the	 on 	 ly 	 	sort	of	world	class	swim	i	had	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	 fail 	 ed 	 	at	back	in	my	20s	--	was	going	from	cuba	to	florida	.
it	was	deep	in	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
no	one	's	ever	 d 	 one 	 	it	 with 	 out 	 	a	 s 	 hark 	 	cage	.
it	's	 daunt 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	more	than	a	hundred	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	a	difficult	 pass 	 age 	 	of	ocean	.
it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	at	my	speed	,	at	my	age	--	for	 any 	 body 	 	's	speed	at	 any 	 body 	 	's	age	--	going	to	take	60	,	 may 	 be 	 	70	,	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 continu 	 ous 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	never	 get 	 ting 	 	out	on	the	boat	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	train	.
i	had	n't	swum	for	31	 year 	 s 	 	,	not	a	stroke	.
and	i	had	 ke 	 pt 	 	in	good	shape	,	but	 swimm 	 ing 	 	's	a	whole	different	animal	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	me	 dur 	 ing 	 	training	.
it	's	a	 smil 	 ing 	 	face	.
and	when	you	're	training	for	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 port 	 	,	you	are	not	 smil 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	an	 ard 	 uous 	 	,	difficult	 s 	 port 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	remember	 smil 	 ing 	 	at	any	time	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 port 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	respect	other	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 compar 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 port 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	to	 cycl 	 ing 	 	and	to	mountain	 climb 	 ing 	 	and	other	of	the	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	type	 event 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 sensor 	 y 	 	 depriv 	 ation 	 	,	a	physical	 d 	 ures 	 s 	 	.
and	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	with	the	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	and	the	10	 hour 	 s 	 	and	the	12	 hour 	 s 	 	and	the	14	 hour 	 s 	 	and	the	15	 hour 	 s 	 	and	the	24	-	hour	 swim 	 s 	 	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	had	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	making	it	through	these	.
and	when	i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	'm	going	to	go	out	and	do	a	15	-	hour	swim	,	and	we	're	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	dock	after	a	long	day	and	it	's	now	night	,	and	we	come	in	and	it	's	14	 hour 	 s 	 	and	58	 minute 	 s 	 	and	i	can	touch	the	dock	and	we	're	 d 	 one 	 	,	the	 train 	 er 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	that	's	great	.
it	's	14	 hour 	 s 	 	58	 minute 	 s 	 	.	who	 care 	 s 	 	the	last	two	 minute 	 s 	 	?	``
i	say	,	``	no	,	it	's	got	to	be	15	 hour 	 s 	 	,	``	and	i	swim	 an 	 other 	 	minute	out	and	 an 	 other 	 	minute	back	to	make	the	15	 hour 	 s 	 	.
and	i	put	together	an	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	.
it	's	not	that	i	did	n't	have	help	,	but	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	i	sort	of	led	,	i	was	the	team	 lead 	 er 	 	.
and	to	get	the	government	 per 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	you	read	in	the	paper	,	you	think	it	's	easy	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	cuba	 every 	 day 	 	?
try	going	in	with	an	armada	like	we	had	of	50	people	and	five	 boat 	 s 	 	and	cnn	's	crew	,	etc	.
the	 navig 	 ation 	 	is	difficult	.
there	's	a	big	river	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	stream	that	 run 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	and	it	's	not	going	in	the	direction	you	are	.
it	's	going	to	the	east	and	you	'd	like	to	go	north	.
it	's	 trick 	 y 	 	.
and	there	's	dehydration	.
and	there	's	 hypo 	 ther 	 mia 	 	.
and	there	are	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
and	there	are	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 gather 	 ed 	 	together	,	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	the	world	's	 lead 	 ing 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	in	every	possible	way	.
and	a	month	ago	,	the	23rd	of	september	,	i	stood	on	that	shore	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	to	that	long	,	long	faraway	horizon	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	do	you	have	it	?
are	your	 shoulder 	 s 	 	ready	?
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	prepared	.
no	stone	left	 un 	 turn 	 ed 	 	.
was	the	mind	ready	?
you	know	,	you	're	 swimm 	 ing 	 	with	the	fogged	 go 	 gg 	 les 	 	,	you	're	 swimm 	 ing 	 	at	60	 stroke 	 s 	 	a	minute	,	so	you	're	never	 re 	 ally 	 	focused	on	 any 	 thing 	 	,	you	do	n't	see	well	.
you	've	got	tight	 bath 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 s 	 	over	your	 ear 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	keep	the	heat	of	the	head	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	where	the	 hypo 	 ther 	 mia 	 	 start 	 s 	 	,	and	so	you	do	n't	hear	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	left	 al 	 one 	 	with	your	own	 thought 	 s 	 	.
and	i	had	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	ready	there	in	english	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	german	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	spanish	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	french	.
you	 s 	 ave 	 	the	french	for	last	.
and	i	had	 song 	 s 	 	,	i	had	a	playlist	in	my	head	--	not	through	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	in	my	own	head	--	of	65	 song 	 s 	 	.
and	i	could	n't	wait	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	dark	in	the	middle	of	the	night	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	when	neil	young	 come 	 s 	 	out	.
and	it	's	odd	,	is	n't	it	?
you	'd	think	you	'd	be	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	leonard	cohen	's	``	hallelujah	``	out	in	the	 majes 	 ty 	 	of	the	ocean	,	not	 song 	 s 	 	about	 hero 	 in 	 	 addict 	 ion 	 	in	new	york	city	.
but	no	,	for	some	reason	i	could	n't	wait	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	dark	of	the	night	and	be	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	,	♫	``	a	heard	you	 knock 	 ing 	 	at	my	 cell 	 ar 	 	door	♫	♫	i	love	you	baby	and	i	want	some	more	♫	♫	ooh	,	ooh	,	the	damage	 d 	 one 	 	``	♫	the	night	before	i	 start 	 ed 	 	,	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	's	``	the	grand	design	.	``
and	i	could	n't	wait	to	trip	the	mind	fantastic	.
about	the	50th	hour	,	i	was	going	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	edge	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
is	there	an	edge	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	an	 envelop 	 e 	 	we	're	living	 in 	 side 	 	of	,	or	no	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	go	onto	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	in	both	time	and	space	?
and	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	 swimm 	 ing 	 	for	50	 hour 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	that	 get 	 s 	 	you	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	could	n't	wait	to	prove	the	athlete	i	am	,	that	 no 	 body 	 	else	in	the	world	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	swim	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	could	do	it	.
and	when	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	water	,	i	 yell 	 ed 	 	in	my	mother	's	french	,	``	courage	!	``
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	and	,	oh	my	god	,	it	was	 glass 	 y 	 	.
and	we	 k 	 new 	 	it	,	all	50	people	on	the	boat	,	we	all	 k 	 new 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	our	time	.
and	i	 re 	 minded 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	couple	 hour 	 s 	 	in	,	you	know	,	the	 s 	 port 	 	is	sort	of	a	 micro 	 cosm 	 	of	life	 it 	 self 	 	.
first	of	all	,	you	're	going	to	hit	 obstacle 	 s 	 	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	great	at	any	one	moment	,	do	n't	take	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	,	be	ready	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	going	to	be	pain	,	there	's	going	to	be	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	not	going	to	feel	 th 	 is 	 	good	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	.
and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	of	the	 hypo 	 ther 	 mia 	 	and	 may 	 be 	 	some	shoulder	pain	and	all	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	--	the	 vomit 	 ing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	 salt 	 water 	 	.
you	're	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	the	liquid	.
your	body	 do 	 es 	 	n't	like	the	 salt 	 water 	 	.
after	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	,	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	you	tend	to	rebel	in	a	lot	of	physical	ways	.
but	no	,	two	 hour 	 s 	 	in	,	wham	!	never	in	my	life	...
i	 k 	 new 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	portuguese	men	o	'	war	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	moon	 j 	 elli 	 es 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	the	box	 jelly 	 fish 	 	from	the	southern	 ocean 	 s 	 	is	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	in	these	 water 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	on	fire	--	 excruciat 	 ing 	 	,	 excruciat 	 ing 	 	pain	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	can	still	see	the	red	line	here	and	up	the	arm	.
 evident 	 ly 	 	,	a	piece	 th 	 is 	 	big	of	tentacle	 ha 	 s 	 	a	hundred	-	thousand	little	 barb 	 s 	 	on	it	and	each	barb	is	not	just	 s 	 ting 	 ing 	 	your	skin	,	it	's	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	venom	.
the	most	 venom 	 ous 	 	animal	that	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	is	the	box	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
and	every	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 barb 	 s 	 	is	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	that	venom	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	central	nervous	system	.
so	first	i	feel	like	 boil 	 ing 	 	hot	oil	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	dipped	in	.
and	i	'm	 yell 	 ing 	 	out	,	``	fire	!	fire	!	fire	!	fire	!
help	me	!	 some 	 body 	 	help	me	!	``
and	the	next	thing	is	 para 	 lysis 	 	.
i	feel	it	in	the	back	and	then	i	feel	it	in	the	chest	up	here	,	and	i	ca	n't	breathe	.
and	now	i	'm	not	 swimm 	 ing 	 	with	a	nice	long	stroke	,	i	'm	sort	of	crabbing	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
then	come	 convuls 	 ions 	 	.
a	young	man	on	our	boat	is	an	emt	.	he	 div 	 es 	 	in	to	try	to	help	me	.
he	's	stung	.
they	drag	him	out	on	the	boat	,	and	he	's	--	 evident 	 ly 	 	,	i	did	n't	see	any	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	but	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	the	boat	and	giving	 him 	 self 	 	epinephrine	 shot 	 s 	 	and	 cry 	 ing 	 	out	.
he	's	29	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	built	,	lean	,	he	's	six	-	foot	,	five	,	 weigh 	 s 	 	265	 lb 	 s 	 	.	,	and	he	is	down	.
and	he	is	 cry 	 ing 	 	and	he	's	 yell 	 ing 	 	to	my	 train 	 er 	 	who	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	me	.
and	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	bonnie	,	i	think	i	'm	going	to	die	.
my	breath	is	down	to	three	 breath 	 s 	 	a	minute	.
i	need	help	,	and	i	ca	n't	help	diana	.	``
so	that	was	at	eight	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	at	night	.
the	doctor	,	medical	team	from	university	of	miami	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	five	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	swam	through	the	night	,	and	at	dawn	they	got	there	and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	with	prednisone	 shot 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	get	out	,	but	was	in	the	water	taking	prednisone	 shot 	 s 	 	,	taking	xanax	,	oxygen	to	the	face	.
it	was	like	an	icu	unit	in	the	water	.
and	i	guess	the	story	is	that	even	 nav 	 y 	 	 seal 	 s 	 	who	are	stung	by	the	box	jelly	,	they	're	 d 	 one 	 	.
they	either	die	or	they	 quick 	 ly 	 	get	to	a	hospital	.
and	i	swam	through	the	night	and	i	swam	through	the	next	day	.
and	the	next	night	at	 du 	 s 	 k 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	wham	!
the	box	jelly	 aga 	 in 	 	--	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	neck	,	all	 a 	 cross 	 	here	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	i	do	n't	like	it	,	i	did	n't	want	to	give	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	but	there	's	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	non	-	stop	swim	and	a	 stag 	 ed 	 	swim	.
and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	in	to	the	 stag 	 ed 	 	swim	.
and	they	got	me	out	and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	with	the	epinephrine	and	the	prednisone	and	with	the	oxygen	and	with	 every 	 thing 	 	they	had	on	board	.
and	i	got	back	in	.
and	i	swam	through	that	night	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	next	day	.
and	at	41	 hour 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	body	could	n't	make	it	.
the	 deva 	 station 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	stings	had	taken	the	 respirator 	 y 	 	system	down	so	that	i	could	n't	make	the	progress	i	 want 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	dream	was	 crush 	 ed 	 	.
and	how	odd	is	 th 	 is 	 	intelligent	person	who	put	 th 	 is 	 	together	and	got	all	these	world	 expert 	 s 	 	together	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	about	the	 jelly 	 fish 	 	,	but	i	was	sort	of	cavalier	.
a	lot	of	 athlete 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	,	sort	of	invincibility	.
they	should	worry	about	me	.	i	do	n't	worry	about	them	.
i	'll	just	swim	right	through	them	.
we	've	got	benadryl	on	board	.	if	i	get	stung	,	i	'll	just	grin	and	bear	it	.
well	there	was	no	grin	and	 bear 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	the	best	 ad 	 vice 	 	i	got	was	from	an	 element 	 ary 	 	school	class	in	the	caribbean	.
and	i	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	these	 kid 	 s 	 	,	120	of	them	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	in	the	school	on	the	 gymnas 	 ium 	 	floor	--	and	i	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	about	the	 jelly 	 fish 	 	and	how	they	're	 gelatin 	 ous 	 	and	you	ca	n't	see	them	at	night	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	.
and	they	have	these	long	30	to	40	to	50	-	ft.	 tent 	 acle 	 s 	 	.
and	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	 wrap 	 ping 	 	.
and	they	can	 s 	 end 	 	the	poison	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	.
and	a	little	kid	from	the	back	was	like	 th 	 is 	 	.

and	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	that	swim	in	a	 bath 	 ing 	 	suit	like	normal	,	and	,	no	joke	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	;	it	came	from	the	 s 	 hark 	 	divers	.
i	 finish 	 ed 	 	the	swim	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	was	 swimm 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	thing	on	.
that	's	how	 scar 	 ed 	 	of	the	 jelly 	 fish 	 	i	was	.
so	now	what	do	i	do	?
i	would	n't	mind	if	every	one	of	you	came	up	on	 th 	 is 	 	stage	 to 	 night 	 	and	told	us	how	you	've	gotten	over	the	big	 disappoint 	 ments 	 	of	your	 live 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	all	had	them	,	have	n't	we	?
we	've	all	had	a	 heart 	 ache 	 	.
and	so	my	journey	now	is	to	find	some	sort	of	grace	in	the	face	of	 th 	 is 	 	defeat	.
and	i	can	look	at	the	journey	,	not	just	the	destination	.
i	can	feel	proud	.	i	can	stand	here	in	front	of	you	 to 	 night 	 	and	say	i	was	 courage 	 ous 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.
thank	you	.
and	with	all	 since 	 r 	 ity 	 	,	i	can	say	,	i	am	glad	i	lived	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	my	life	that	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	goal	to	not	suffer	 regret 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,	i	got	there	with	that	goal	.
when	you	live	that	way	,	when	you	live	with	that	kind	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	there	's	no	time	,	there	's	no	time	for	 regret 	 s 	 	,	you	're	just	moving	forward	.
and	i	want	to	live	every	day	of	the	rest	of	my	life	that	way	,	swim	or	no	swim	.
but	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 accept 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	defeat	is	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	if	cancer	 ha 	 s 	 	won	,	if	there	's	death	and	we	have	no	choice	,	then	grace	and	 accept 	 ance 	 	are	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
but	that	ocean	's	still	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	hope	is	still	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	want	to	be	the	crazy	woman	who	 do 	 es 	 	it	for	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	tries	and	 fail 	 s 	 	and	tries	and	 fail 	 s 	 	and	tries	and	 fail 	 s 	 	,	but	i	can	swim	from	cuba	to	florida	,	and	i	will	swim	from	cuba	to	florida	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
and	so	,	what	after	that	?
are	you	going	to	swim	the	atlantic	?
no	,	that	's	the	last	swim	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	swim	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
but	i	'm	ready	.
and	by	the	way	,	a	 report 	 er 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	me	the	other	day	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	 look 	 ed 	 	on	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	saw	my	 birth 	 day 	 	was	august	22nd	1949	,	and	for	some	odd	reason	in	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	they	had	my	death	date	too	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	did	you	know	you	're	going	to	die	the	same	place	you	 we 	 re 	 	born	,	new	york	city	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	in	january	of	'35	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	nope	.	i	did	n't	know	.	``
and	now	i	'm	going	to	live	to	85	.
i	have	three	more	 year 	 s 	 	than	i	thought	.
