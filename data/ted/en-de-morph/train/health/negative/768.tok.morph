 some 	 one 	 	once	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 politic 	 s 	 	is	,	of	course	,	``	 show 	 bi 	 z 	 	for	 ug 	 ly 	 	people	.	``
so	,	on	that	 bas 	 is 	 	,	i	feel	like	i	've	 re 	 ally 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
the	other	thing	to	think	of	is	what	an	honor	it	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	,	to	give	a	ted	talk	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	here	in	the	u.k.	,	where	the	reputation	of	 politic 	 s 	 	,	with	the	 expense 	 s 	 	scandal	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 un 	 k 	 	so	low	.
there	was	even	a	story	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	had	thought	about	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 placing 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	 politic 	 ians 	 	.
and	 some 	 one 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	why	?	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	there	's	no	 short 	 age 	 	of	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	no	one	 re 	 ally 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	them	and	,	after	all	,	there	are	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 rat 	 s 	 	just	wo	n't	do	.	``
now	,	i	know	you	all	love	data	,	so	i	'm	 start 	 ing 	 	with	a	data	-	rich	slide	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	i	think	,	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	fact	to	bear	in	mind	in	british	 politic 	 s 	 	or	american	 politic 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	:	we	have	run	out	of	money	.
we	have	vast	budget	 defici 	 ts 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	global	public	debt	clock	,	and	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	's	32	trillion	and	 count 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	think	what	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 re 	 cognition 	 	,	that	there	's	one	question	in	 politic 	 s 	 	at	the	moment	above	all	other	,	and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	one	:	how	do	we	make	 thing 	 s 	 	better	 with 	 out 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	more	money	?
 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	n't	going	to	be	a	lot	of	money	to	improve	public	 service 	 s 	 	,	or	to	improve	government	,	or	to	improve	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 politic 	 ians 	 	talk	about	.
so	what	 follow 	 s 	 	from	that	is	that	if	you	think	it	's	all	about	money	--	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	measure	success	in	public	 service 	 s 	 	in	health	care	and	education	and	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	by	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	more	money	,	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	measure	progress	by	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	money	--	you	're	going	to	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	time	.
but	if	you	think	a	whole	lot	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	matter	that	lead	up	to	well	 be 	 ing 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	your	family	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	 friend 	 ship 	 	,	community	,	 value 	 s 	 	--	then	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	time	to	be	in	 politic 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	argument	i	want	to	make	 to 	 night 	 	,	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	argument	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	if	we	combine	the	right	 politic 	 al 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	the	right	 politic 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	with	the	 in 	 credible 	 	information	revolution	that	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	place	,	and	that	all	of	you	know	so	much	more	about	than	i	do	,	i	think	there	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 make 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 make 	 	government	,	 re 	 make 	 	public	 service 	 s 	 	,	and	 achiev 	 e 	 	what	's	up	on	that	slide	,	which	is	a	big	 in 	 crease 	 	in	our	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	the	argument	i	want	to	make	 to 	 night 	 	.
so	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
now	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	for	a	minute	that	british	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	have	all	the	 answer 	 s 	 	.
of	course	we	do	n't	.
but	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	at	heart	that	i	think	drive	a	 conserv 	 ative 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	relevant	to	 th 	 is 	 	whole	debate	.
the	first	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	if	you	give	people	more	power	and	control	over	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	if	you	give	people	more	choice	,	if	you	put	them	in	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	seat	,	then	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	create	a	 strong 	 er 	 	and	better	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	if	you	marry	 th 	 is 	 	fact	with	the	 in 	 credible 	 	abundance	of	information	that	we	have	in	our	world	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	think	you	can	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 re 	 make 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 make 	 	government	,	 re 	 make 	 	your	public	 service 	 s 	 	.
the	second	thing	we	 believ 	 e 	 	is	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	going	with	the	grain	of	human	nature	.
 politic 	 s 	 	and	 politic 	 ians 	 	will	 on 	 ly 	 	succeed	if	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	try	and	treat	with	people	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 a 	 s 	 	they	would	like	them	to	be	.
now	,	if	you	combine	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 conserv 	 ative 	 	thought	--	go	with	the	grain	of	human	nature	--	with	all	the	 advance 	 s 	 	in	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	,	some	of	which	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	think	we	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	a	real	 in 	 crease 	 	in	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,	in	happiness	,	in	a	 strong 	 er 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	whole	lot	more	money	.
now	,	why	do	i	think	now	is	the	moment	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	argument	?
well	,	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	you	're	going	to	suffer	a	short	,	 condens 	 ed 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	 less 	 on 	 	about	what	i	would	say	are	the	three	 pass 	 age 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	:	the	pre	-	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	age	,	the	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	age	and	what	we	now	live	in	,	which	i	think	is	a	post	-	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	age	.
a	 simpl 	 er 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	of	it	is	that	we	have	gone	from	a	world	of	local	control	,	then	we	went	to	a	world	of	central	control	,	and	now	we	're	in	a	world	of	people	control	.
local	power	,	central	power	,	now	,	people	power	.
now	,	here	is	king	cnut	,	king	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
thought	he	could	turn	back	the	 wave 	 s 	 	;	could	n't	turn	back	the	 wave 	 s 	 	.
could	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	turn	back	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	king	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	while	it	still	took	 hour 	 s 	 	and	 hour 	 s 	 	and	 week 	 s 	 	and	 week 	 s 	 	to	 tra 	 verse 	 	your	own	country	,	there	was	n't	much	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	charge	of	.
you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	in	charge	of	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	,	justice	,	education	,	health	,	 wel 	 fare 	 	.
you	could	just	about	go	to	war	and	that	was	about	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	pre	-	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	age	,	an	age	in	which	 every 	 thing 	 	had	to	be	local	.
you	had	to	have	local	control	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	no	 national 	 ly 	 	-	 avail 	 able 	 	information	 be 	 cause 	 	travel	was	so	 restrict 	 ed 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	pre	-	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	age	.
next	part	of	the	cold	 histo 	 ry 	 	 less 	 on 	 	,	the	 love 	 ly 	 	picture	of	the	british	industrial	revolution	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	transport	,	travel	information	 we 	 re 	 	possible	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	to	,	what	i	like	to	call	,	the	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	age	.
and	 hope 	 fully 	 	 th 	 is 	 	slide	is	going	to	morph	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	.	there	we	are	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	you	have	the	big	,	strong	,	central	state	.
it	was	able	--	but	 on 	 ly 	 	it	was	able	--	to	organize	health	care	,	education	,	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	,	justice	.
and	it	was	a	world	of	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	not	local	power	,	but	now	central	power	.
it	had	 suck 	 ed 	 	all	that	power	up	from	the	 local 	 ities 	 	.
it	was	able	to	do	that	 it 	 self 	 	.
the	next	great	stage	,	which	all	of	you	are	so	familiar	with	:	the	massive	information	revolution	.
just	consider	 th 	 is 	 	one	fact	:	one	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	these	10	 word 	 s 	 	cost	50	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
right	now	,	here	we	are	linked	up	to	long	beach	and	 every 	 where 	 	else	,	and	all	these	secret	 location 	 s 	 	for	a	fraction	of	that	cost	,	and	we	can	 s 	 end 	 	and	 receiv 	 e 	 	huge	 quant 	 ities 	 	of	information	 with 	 out 	 	it	 cost 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
so	we	're	now	living	in	a	post	-	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	age	,	where	genuine	people	power	is	possible	.
now	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	for	our	 politic 	 s 	 	,	for	our	public	 service 	 s 	 	,	for	our	government	?
well	i	ca	n't	,	in	the	time	i	've	got	,	give	huge	 number 	 s 	 	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	but	let	me	just	give	a	few	of	the	ways	that	life	can	change	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	obvious	,	in	a	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	think	about	how	all	of	you	have	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	we	shop	,	the	way	we	travel	,	the	way	that	business	is	 d 	 one 	 	.
that	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	;	the	information	and	 inter 	 net 	 	revolution	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	gone	all	the	way	through	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	ways	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	,	in	every	way	,	yet	 touch 	 ed 	 	our	government	.
so	,	how	could	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
well	,	i	think	there	are	three	chief	ways	that	it	should	make	an	enormous	 differ 	 ence 	 	:	in	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	in	 great 	 er 	 	choice	and	in	 account 	 ability 	 	,	in	giving	us	that	genuine	people	power	.
if	we	take	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	here	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	,	the	missouri	 account 	 ability 	 	 port 	 al 	 	.
in	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	the	government	could	hold	the	information	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 elect 	 ed 	 	people	could	try	and	grab	that	information	and	question	it	and	 challeng 	 e 	 	it	.
now	here	,	on	one	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	one	state	in	america	,	every	single	dollar	 s 	 pent 	 	by	that	government	is	 search 	 able 	 	,	is	 analyz 	 able 	 	,	is	 check 	 able 	 	.
think	of	the	huge	change	that	 mean 	 s 	 	:	any	business	that	 want 	 s 	 	to	bid	for	a	government	contract	can	see	what	 current 	 ly 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	.
 any 	 one 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	could	do	that	service	better	,	i	could	deliver	it	 cheap 	 er 	 	,	``	it	's	all	 avail 	 able 	 	there	.
we	have	 on 	 ly 	 	,	in	government	and	in	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	to	scratch	the	surface	of	what	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	commercial	world	with	the	information	revolution	.
so	,	complete	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	will	make	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	if	we	win	the	election	,	we	are	going	to	make	all	government	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	over	25,000	 pound 	 s 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	and	 avail 	 able 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	 search 	 able 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	see	.
we	're	going	to	make	every	contract	--	we	're	 announc 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	 avail 	 able 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	so	 any 	 one 	 	can	see	what	the	 term 	 s 	 	are	,	what	the	 condition 	 s 	 	are	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	huge	value	for	money	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	huge	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	in	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
choice	.	now	you	all	shop	 on 	 line 	 	,	 compar 	 e 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	do	 every 	 thing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	yet	 th 	 is 	 	revolution	 ha 	 s 	 	 hard 	 ly 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	the	surface	of	public	 service 	 s 	 	like	education	,	or	health	care	or	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	're	going	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	change	 massive 	 ly 	 	.
we	should	be	making	 th 	 is 	 	change	with	the	information	revolution	in	our	country	,	with	 search 	 able 	 	health	 s 	 ites 	 	,	so	you	can	see	what	 operation 	 s 	 	work	out	 proper 	 ly 	 	,	what	 record 	 s 	 	 doctor 	 s 	 	have	,	the	 clean 	 lines 	 s 	 	of	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	who	 do 	 es 	 	best	at	 infect 	 ion 	 	control	--	all	of	the	information	that	would	once	be	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	health	is	now	 avail 	 able 	 	for	all	of	us	to	see	.
and	the	third	of	these	big	 change 	 s 	 	:	 account 	 ability 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	i	think	,	is	a	huge	change	.
it	is	a	crime	map	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	crime	map	from	chicago	.
so	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	 on 	 ly 	 	the	police	have	the	information	about	which	 crime 	 s 	 	are	 commit 	 ted 	 	where	,	and	we	have	to	employ	people	in	government	to	try	and	hold	the	police	to	account	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	vast	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	people	power	,	where	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	can	see	what	 crime 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	--	where	,	when	and	by	whom	--	and	we	can	hold	the	police	to	account	.
and	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	a	bit	like	a	chef	's	hat	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	's	an	assault	,	the	one	in	blue	.
you	can	see	what	crime	is	 commit 	 ted 	 	where	,	and	you	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	hold	your	police	force	to	account	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	three	ways	--	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	 account 	 ability 	 	and	choice	--	will	make	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
now	i	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	the	other	principle	that	i	think	we	should	work	on	is	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	people	,	is	 recogn 	 izing 	 	that	going	with	the	grain	of	human	nature	you	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	so	much	more	.
now	,	we	're	got	a	huge	revolution	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	why	people	 behav 	 e 	 	in	the	way	that	they	do	,	and	a	great	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	put	that	knowledge	and	information	to	 great 	 er 	 	use	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	some	of	these	people	.
we	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 advise 	 d 	 	by	some	of	these	people	,	 a 	 s 	 	was	 s 	 aid 	 	,	to	try	and	 br 	 ing 	 	all	the	experience	to	book	.
let	me	just	give	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	i	think	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	simple	,	and	i	love	.
we	want	to	get	people	to	be	more	energy	efficient	.
why	?	it	 cut 	 s 	 	fuel	poverty	,	it	 cut 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 bill 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 cut 	 s 	 	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
how	do	you	do	it	?
well	,	we	've	had	government	information	 campaign 	 s 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	when	they	tell	you	to	 s 	 witch 	 	off	the	 light 	 s 	 	when	you	 leav 	 e 	 	the	home	.
we	even	had	--	one	government	 mini 	 ster 	 	once	told	us	to	brush	our	 tee 	 th 	 	in	the	dark	.
i	do	n't	think	they	 last 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.
look	at	what	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	simple	piece	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	.
the	best	way	to	get	 some 	 one 	 	to	cut	 the 	 ir 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	bill	is	to	show	them	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	,	to	show	them	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	show	what	an	energy	conscious	neighbor	is	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	.
that	sort	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	can	transform	people	's	behavior	in	a	way	that	all	the	 bull 	 y 	 ing 	 	and	all	the	information	and	all	the	 badge 	 ring 	 	from	a	government	can	not	possibly	 achiev 	 e 	 	.
other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	are	 recycl 	 ing 	 	.
we	all	know	we	need	to	 re 	 cycle 	 	more	.
how	do	we	make	it	happen	?
all	the	proof	from	america	is	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	pay	people	to	 re 	 cycle 	 	,	if	you	give	them	a	carrot	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	stick	,	you	can	transform	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	add	up	to	?
here	are	my	two	 favor 	 ite 	 	u.s.	 speech 	 es 	 	of	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	here	we	have	jfk	with	that	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	simple	and	 power 	 ful 	 	 formula 	 tion 	 	,	``	ask	not	what	your	country	can	do	for	you	;	ask	what	you	can	do	for	your	country	,	``	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	noble	sentiment	.
but	when	he	made	that	speech	,	what	could	you	do	to	build	the	 strong 	 er 	 	,	better	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
you	could	fight	for	your	country	,	you	could	die	for	your	country	,	you	could	serve	in	your	country	's	civil	service	,	but	you	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	information	and	the	knowledge	and	the	ability	to	help	build	the	 strong 	 er 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	the	way	that	you	do	now	.
and	i	think	an	even	more	 wonder 	 ful 	 	speech	,	which	i	'm	going	to	read	a	big	chunk	of	,	which	 sum 	 s 	 	up	what	i	 s 	 aid 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	about	 believ 	 ing 	 	there	is	more	to	life	than	money	,	and	more	that	we	should	try	and	measure	than	money	.
and	it	is	robert	kennedy	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	why	gross	national	product	 capture 	 s 	 	so	little	:	it	``	 do 	 es 	 	not	allow	for	the	health	of	our	children	,	the	quality	of	 the 	 ir 	 	education	,	or	the	joy	of	 the 	 ir 	 	play	.
