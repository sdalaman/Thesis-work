i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 some 	 thing 	 	kind	of	big	.
we	'll	start	here	.
65	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	had	a	bad	day	.
a	chunk	of	rock	six	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	moving	 some 	 thing 	 	like	50	 time 	 s 	 	the	speed	of	a	rifle	bullet	,	 s 	 lam 	 med 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	earth	.
it	released	 it 	 s 	 	energy	all	at	once	,	and	it	was	an	explosion	that	was	mind	-	 numb 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	took	every	nuclear	weapon	ever	built	at	the	height	of	the	cold	war	,	 lump 	 ed 	 	them	together	and	 ble 	 w 	 	them	up	at	the	same	time	,	that	would	be	one	one	-	 million 	 th 	 	of	the	energy	released	at	that	moment	.
the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	had	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	day	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
now	,	a	six	-	mile	-	wide	rock	is	 ver 	 y 	 	large	.
we	all	live	here	in	boulder	.
if	you	look	out	your	window	and	you	can	see	long	's	peak	,	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	familiar	with	it	.
now	,	scoop	up	long	's	peak	,	and	put	it	out	in	space	.
take	meeker	,	mt	.	meeker	.	lump	that	in	there	,	and	put	that	in	space	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	mt	.	everest	,	and	k	2	,	and	the	indian	 peak 	 s 	 	.
then	you	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	an	idea	of	how	much	rock	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
we	know	it	was	that	big	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	impact	it	had	and	the	 crat 	 er 	 	it	left	.
it	hit	in	what	we	now	know	 a 	 s 	 	yucatan	,	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	.
you	can	see	here	,	there	's	the	yucatan	 pen 	 insula 	 	,	if	you	 recogn 	 ize 	 	cozumel	off	the	east	coast	there	.
here	is	how	big	of	a	 crat 	 er 	 	was	left	.
it	was	huge	.	to	give	you	a	sense	of	the	scale	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	there	you	go	.	the	scale	here	is	50	 mile 	 s 	 	on	top	,	a	hundred	 kilometer 	 s 	 	on	the	bottom	.	 th 	 is 	 	thing	was	300	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	--	200	 mile 	 s 	 	--	an	enormous	 crat 	 er 	 	that	 excav 	 ated 	 	out	vast	 amount 	 s 	 	of	earth	that	 splash 	 ed 	 	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	and	set	 fire 	 s 	 	all	over	the	planet	,	threw	up	 en 	 ough 	 	dust	to	block	out	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
it	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	75	percent	of	all	species	on	earth	.
now	,	not	all	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	are	that	big	.
some	of	them	are	 small 	 er 	 	.
here	is	one	that	came	in	over	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	october	of	1992	.
it	came	in	on	a	friday	night	.
why	is	that	 import 	 ant 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	back	then	,	video	 camera 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	popular	,	and	people	would	 br 	 ing 	 	them	,	 parent 	 s 	 	would	 br 	 ing 	 	them	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	'	 foot 	 ball 	 	 game 	 s 	 	to	film	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	play	 foot 	 ball 	 	.	and	since	 th 	 is 	 	came	in	on	a	friday	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	great	 foot 	 age 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 break 	 ing 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	it	came	in	over	west	virgina	,	maryland	,	pennsylvania	and	new	jersey	 un 	 til 	 	it	did	that	to	a	car	in	new	york	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	200	-	mile	-	wide	 crat 	 er 	 	,	but	then	 aga 	 in 	 	you	can	see	the	rock	which	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	right	here	,	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	,	that	hit	that	car	and	did	that	damage	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	thing	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	school	bus	when	it	first	came	in	.
it	broke	up	through	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	pressure	,	it	 crumb 	 led 	 	,	and	then	the	 piece 	 s 	 	fell	 a 	 part 	 	and	did	some	damage	.
now	,	you	would	n't	want	that	 fall 	 ing 	 	on	your	foot	or	your	head	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	would	do	that	to	it	.
that	would	be	bad	.
but	it	wo	n't	wipe	out	,	you	know	,	all	life	on	earth	,	so	that	's	fine	.	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	you	do	n't	need	 some 	 thing 	 	six	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	to	do	a	lot	of	damage	.
there	is	a	 med 	 ian 	 	point	between	 tin 	 y 	 	rock	and	 gig 	 antic 	 	rock	,	and	in	fact	,	if	any	of	you	have	ever	 be 	 en 	 	to	near	winslow	,	arizona	,	there	is	a	 crat 	 er 	 	in	the	desert	there	that	is	so	 icon 	 ic 	 	that	it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	meteor	 crat 	 er 	 	.
to	give	you	a	sense	of	scale	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	a	mile	wide	.
if	you	look	up	at	the	top	,	that	's	a	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 re 	 creation 	 al 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	right	there	.
so	it	's	about	a	mile	 a 	 cross 	 	,	600	feet	deep	.
the	object	that	 form 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	30	to	50	 yard 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	so	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	mackey	 audit 	 orium 	 	here	.
it	came	in	at	 speed 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	tremendous	,	 s 	 lam 	 med 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ground	,	 ble 	 w 	 	up	,	and	 explode 	 d 	 	with	the	energy	of	 rough 	 ly 	 	a	20	-	megaton	nuclear	bomb	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 heft 	 y 	 	bomb	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	50,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	so	it	may	have	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	a	few	buffalo	or	 ant 	 elope 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	out	in	the	desert	,	but	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	not	have	 caus 	 ed 	 	global	 deva 	 station 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	to	hit	the	ground	to	do	a	lot	of	damage	.
now	,	in	1908	,	over	siberia	,	near	the	tunguska	region	--	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	dan	aykroyd	 fan 	 s 	 	and	saw	``	 ghost 	 buster 	 s 	 	,	``	when	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 great 	 est 	 	cross	-	dimensional	rift	since	the	siberia	blast	of	1909	,	where	he	got	the	date	wrong	,	but	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
it	was	1908	.	that	's	fine	.	i	can	live	with	that	.
 an 	 other 	 	rock	came	 in 	 to 	 	the	earth	's	atmosphere	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	 ble 	 w 	 	up	above	the	ground	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 mile 	 s 	 	up	above	the	surface	of	the	earth	.
the	heat	from	the	explosion	set	fire	to	the	forest	 be 	 low 	 	it	,	and	then	the	shock	wave	came	down	and	 knock 	 ed 	 	down	 tree 	 s 	 	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	square	 mile 	 s 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	did	a	huge	amount	of	damage	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	rock	 prob 	 ably 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 audit 	 orium 	 	that	we	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	.
in	meteor	 crat 	 er 	 	it	was	made	of	metal	,	and	metal	is	much	 tough 	 er 	 	,	so	it	made	it	to	the	ground	.
the	one	over	tunguska	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	made	of	rock	,	and	that	's	much	more	 crumb 	 ly 	 	,	so	it	 ble 	 w 	 	up	in	the	air	.	either	way	,	these	are	tremendous	 explosion 	 s 	 	,	20	 mega 	 ton 	 s 	 	.
now	,	when	these	 thing 	 s 	 	blow	up	,	they	're	not	going	to	do	global	 eco 	 logical 	 	damage	.
they	're	not	going	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	dinosaur	-	killer	did	.
they	're	just	not	big	 en 	 ough 	 	.
but	they	will	do	global	economic	damage	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	to	hit	,	 necess 	 arily 	 	,	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	damage	.
they	do	n't	have	to	do	global	 deva 	 station 	 	.
if	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	to	hit	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 any 	 where 	 	,	it	would	cause	a	panic	.
but	if	it	came	over	a	city	,	an	 import 	 ant 	 	city	--	not	that	any	city	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	 other 	 s 	 	,	but	some	of	them	we	depend	on	them	more	on	the	global	economic	 bas 	 is 	 	--	that	could	do	a	huge	amount	of	damage	to	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
so	,	now	that	i	've	 scar 	 ed 	 	the	crap	out	of	you	...
what	can	we	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	?	all	right	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	potential	threat	.
let	me	note	that	we	have	not	had	a	giant	impact	like	the	dinosaur	-	killer	for	65	million	 year 	 s 	 	.	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	.
the	 small 	 er 	 	 one 	 s 	 	happen	more	often	,	but	 prob 	 ably 	 	on	the	order	of	a	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	,	every	few	centuries	or	every	few	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	still	 some 	 thing 	 	to	be	aware	of	.
well	,	what	do	we	do	about	them	?
the	first	thing	we	have	to	do	is	find	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	of	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	that	 pass 	 ed 	 	us	in	2009	.
it	's	right	here	.
but	you	can	see	that	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	faint	.
i	do	n't	even	know	if	you	can	see	that	in	the	back	row	.	these	are	just	 star 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	rock	that	was	about	30	 yard 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	so	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 ble 	 w 	 	up	over	tunguska	and	hit	arizona	50,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	faint	.
they	're	hard	to	see	,	and	the	sky	is	 re 	 ally 	 	big	.
we	have	to	find	these	 thing 	 s 	 	first	.
well	the	good	news	is	,	we	're	looking	for	them	.
nasa	 ha 	 s 	 	 devote 	 d 	 	money	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	national	science	 found 	 ation 	 	,	other	 count 	 ries 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	're	building	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	that	are	looking	for	the	threat	.	that	's	a	great	first	step	,	but	what	's	the	second	step	?	the	second	step	is	that	we	see	one	 head 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	us	,	we	have	to	stop	it	.	what	do	we	do	?
you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	about	the	 a 	 steroid 	 	apophis	.	if	you	have	n't	yet	,	you	will	.
if	you	've	heard	about	the	mayan	2012	 apocalyp 	 s 	 e 	 	,	you	're	going	to	hear	about	apophis	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 key 	 ed 	 	in	to	all	the	 doom 	 s 	 day 	 	 network 	 s 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
apophis	is	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	that	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	2004	.
it	's	 rough 	 ly 	 	250	 yard 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	so	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	--	big	 s 	 ize 	 	,	you	know	,	 big 	 ger 	 	than	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	 stad 	 ium 	 	--	and	it	's	going	to	pass	by	the	earth	in	april	of	2029	.
and	it	's	going	to	pass	us	so	close	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	come	 under 	 neath 	 	our	weather	 satellite 	 s 	 	.
the	earth	's	 gravit 	 y 	 	is	going	to	bend	the	orbit	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	so	much	that	if	it	's	just	right	,	if	it	 pass 	 es 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	region	of	space	,	 th 	 is 	 	 kid 	 ney 	 	bean	-	shaped	region	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 key 	 hole 	 	,	the	earth	's	 gravit 	 y 	 	will	bend	it	just	 en 	 ough 	 	that	seven	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	on	april	13	,	which	is	a	friday	,	i	'll	note	,	in	the	year	2036	...
--	you	ca	n't	plan	that	kind	of	stuff	--	apophis	is	going	to	hit	us	.	and	it	's	250	 meter 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	so	it	would	do	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	damage	.
now	the	good	news	is	that	the	 odd 	 s 	 	of	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pass 	 ing 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	 key 	 hole 	 	and	hitting	us	next	go	-	around	are	one	in	a	million	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 odd 	 s 	 	,	so	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	am	not	 ly 	 ing 	 	awake	at	night	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	at	all	.
i	do	n't	think	apophis	is	a	problem	.
in	fact	,	apophis	is	a	 bless 	 ing 	 	in	 dis 	 guise 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 wok 	 e 	 	us	up	to	the	 danger 	 s 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	thing	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	could	hit	us	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	.
it	wo	n't	,	but	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	chance	to	 stud 	 y 	 	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	.	we	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	understand	these	 key 	 hole 	 s 	 	,	and	now	we	do	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	how	do	you	stop	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	let	me	ask	you	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	road	and	a	car	's	headed	for	you	?	what	do	you	do	?	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
right	?	move	.	the	car	 go 	 es 	 	past	you	.
but	we	ca	n't	move	the	earth	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	 eas 	 ily 	 	,	but	we	can	move	a	small	 a 	 steroid 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	we	've	even	 d 	 one 	 	it	.
in	the	year	2005	,	nasa	 launch 	 ed 	 	a	 prob 	 e 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	deep	impact	,	which	 s 	 lam 	 med 	 	 in 	 to 	 	--	 s 	 lam 	 med 	 	a	piece	of	 it 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	nucleus	of	a	 com 	 et 	 	.
 come 	 ts 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	.
the	purpose	was	n't	to	push	it	out	of	the	way	.
the	purpose	was	to	make	a	 crat 	 er 	 	to	 excav 	 ate 	 	the	material	and	see	what	was	 under 	 neath 	 	the	surface	of	 th 	 is 	 	 com 	 et 	 	,	which	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	about	.
we	did	move	the	 com 	 et 	 	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	bit	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	but	that	was	n't	the	point	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	 orbit 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	at	10	 mile 	 s 	 	per	second	,	20	 mile 	 s 	 	per	second	.
we	shot	a	space	 prob 	 e 	 	at	it	and	hit	it	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
imagine	how	hard	that	must	be	,	and	we	did	it	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	can	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
if	we	need	,	if	we	see	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	that	's	coming	 to 	 ward 	 	us	,	and	it	's	headed	right	for	us	,	and	we	have	two	 year 	 s 	 	to	go	,	boom	!	we	hit	it	.
you	can	try	to	--	you	know	,	if	you	watch	the	 movie 	 s 	 	,	you	might	think	about	,	why	do	n't	we	use	a	nuclear	weapon	?
it	's	like	,	well	,	you	can	try	that	,	but	the	problem	is	 tim 	 ing 	 	.
you	shoot	a	nuclear	weapon	at	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	you	have	to	blow	it	up	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 milli 	 second 	 s 	 	of	 toler 	 ance 	 	or	else	you	'll	just	 mis 	 s 	 	it	.
and	there	are	a	lot	of	other	 problem 	 s 	 	with	that	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	do	.
but	just	hitting	 some 	 thing 	 	?	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	easy	.
i	think	even	nasa	can	do	that	,	and	they	 prov 	 ed 	 	that	they	can	.
the	problem	is	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	hit	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	you	've	 change 	 d 	 	the	orbit	,	you	measure	the	orbit	and	then	you	find	out	,	oh	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	just	 push 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 key 	 hole 	 	,	and	now	it	's	going	to	hit	us	in	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
well	,	my	opinion	is	,	fine	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
it	's	not	hitting	us	in	six	 month 	 s 	 	.	that	's	good	.
now	we	have	three	 year 	 s 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	you	can	hit	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.	that	's	kind	of	ham	-	fisted	.	you	might	just	push	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	third	 key 	 hole 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	so	you	do	n't	do	that	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	part	,	it	's	the	part	i	just	love	.
after	the	big	 ma 	 cho 	 	``	rrrrrrr	 b 	 am 	 	!	we	're	gon	na	hit	 th 	 is 	 	thing	in	the	face	,	``	then	we	 br 	 ing 	 	in	the	 vel 	 vet 	 	 glove 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	group	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	and	 astro 	 nauts 	 	and	they	call	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	b	612	 found 	 ation 	 	.	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	've	read	``	the	little	prince	,	``	you	understand	that	 re 	 ference 	 	,	i	hope	.	the	little	prince	who	lived	on	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	b	612	.
these	are	smart	 guy 	 s 	 	--	men	and	women	--	 astro 	 nauts 	 	,	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	.
 rust 	 y 	 	schweickart	,	who	was	an	apollo	9	 astro 	 naut 	 	,	is	on	 th 	 is 	 	.	dan	durda	,	my	friend	who	made	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	 work 	 s 	 	here	at	 south 	 west 	 	research	institute	in	boulder	,	on	walnut	street	.	he	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	image	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 astronomer 	 s 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	for	them	.	if	we	see	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	that	's	going	to	hit	the	earth	and	we	have	 en 	 ough 	 	time	,	we	can	hit	it	to	move	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	better	orbit	.	but	then	what	we	do	is	we	launch	a	 prob 	 e 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	weigh	a	ton	or	two	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	huge	--	couple	of	 ton 	 s 	 	,	not	that	big	--	and	you	park	it	near	the	 a 	 steroid 	 	.
you	do	n't	land	on	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	tumbling	end	over	end	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	land	on	them	.
 in 	 stead 	 	you	get	near	it	.
the	 gravit 	 y 	 	of	the	 a 	 steroid 	 	 pull 	 s 	 	on	the	 prob 	 e 	 	,	and	the	 prob 	 e 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	couple	of	 ton 	 s 	 	of	mass	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	bit	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	but	it	's	 en 	 ough 	 	that	it	can	pull	the	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	and	you	have	your	 rocket 	 s 	 	set	up	,	so	you	can	--	oh	,	you	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	see	it	here	,	but	there	's	rocket	 plume 	 s 	 	--	and	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	and	if	you	move	the	 prob 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 gent 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	 fine 	 s 	 s 	 e 	 	that	rock	 in 	 to 	 	a	safe	orbit	.
you	can	even	put	in	orbit	around	the	earth	where	we	could	mine	it	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	that	's	a	whole	other	thing	.	i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
but	we	'd	be	rich	!
so	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	right	?
there	are	these	giant	 rock 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	out	there	,	and	they	're	hitting	us	,	and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	damage	to	us	,	but	we	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	all	the	 piece 	 s 	 	are	in	place	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	have	 astronomer 	 s 	 	in	place	with	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	looking	for	them	.	we	have	smart	people	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	people	,	who	are	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	and	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	fix	the	problem	,	and	we	have	the	technology	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 prob 	 e 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	ca	n't	use	chemical	 rocket 	 s 	 	.
chemical	 rocket 	 s 	 	provide	too	much	thrust	,	too	much	push	.	the	 prob 	 e 	 	would	just	shoot	away	.
we	 invent 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	an	ion	drive	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	thrust	engine	.
it	 generate 	 s 	 	the	force	a	piece	of	paper	would	have	on	your	hand	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	light	,	but	it	can	run	for	 month 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	,	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	that	 ver 	 y 	 	gentle	push	.
if	 any 	 body 	 	here	is	a	fan	of	the	original	``	star	trek	,	``	they	ran	 a 	 cross 	 	an	alien	ship	that	had	an	ion	drive	,	and	spock	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 technical 	 ly 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	.
they	're	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	us	with	 th 	 is 	 	drive	.	``
 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	have	an	ion	drive	now	.
we	do	n't	have	the	enterprise	,	but	we	've	got	an	ion	drive	now	.
spock	.
so	...
that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	us	and	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	them	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	happen	to	us	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	and	us	is	that	we	have	a	space	program	and	we	can	vote	,	and	so	we	can	change	our	future	.
we	have	the	ability	to	change	our	future	.
65	million	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	we	do	n't	have	to	have	our	 bone 	 s 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	dust	in	a	museum	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
