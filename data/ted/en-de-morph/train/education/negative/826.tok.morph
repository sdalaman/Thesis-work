in	my	industry	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 image 	 s 	 	can	change	the	world	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	're	naive	,	we	're	bright	-	eyed	and	bushy	-	tailed	.
the	truth	is	that	we	know	that	the	 image 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	do	n't	change	the	world	,	but	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	aware	that	,	since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 photograph 	 y 	 	,	 image 	 s 	 	have	 provok 	 ed 	 	 react 	 ions 	 	in	people	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 react 	 ions 	 	have	 caus 	 ed 	 	change	to	happen	.
so	let	's	begin	with	a	group	of	 image 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	if	you	did	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 man 	 y 	 	or	most	of	them	.
they	're	best	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 icon 	 ic 	 	:	so	 icon 	 ic 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 cliche 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	they	're	so	well	-	known	that	you	might	even	 recogn 	 ize 	 	them	in	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	or	 some 	 what 	 	different	form	.
but	i	think	we	're	looking	for	 some 	 thing 	 	more	.
we	're	looking	for	 some 	 thing 	 	more	.
we	're	looking	for	 image 	 s 	 	that	shine	an	 un 	 com 	 promising 	 	light	on	 cruci 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 image 	 s 	 	that	transcend	 border 	 s 	 	,	that	transcend	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	 image 	 s 	 	that	 provok 	 e 	 	us	to	step	up	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	to	act	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	image	you	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	.
it	 change 	 d 	 	our	view	of	the	physical	world	.
we	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	our	planet	from	 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	before	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	credit	a	lot	of	the	birth	of	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	to	our	 see 	 ing 	 	the	planet	like	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	first	time	--	 it 	 s 	 	 small 	 ness 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	 f 	 rag 	 ility 	 	.
forty	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	group	,	more	than	most	,	are	well	aware	of	the	 destruct 	 ive 	 	power	that	our	species	can	wield	over	our	environment	.
and	at	last	,	we	appear	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	 destruct 	 ive 	 	power	 take 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	different	 form 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	these	 image 	 s 	 	taken	by	brent	stirton	in	the	congo	.
these	 gorilla 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 murder 	 ed 	 	,	some	would	even	say	 cruc 	 ified 	 	,	and	 un 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	they	 spark 	 ed 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 out 	 rage 	 	.
most	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 tragic 	 ally 	 	 re 	 minded 	 	of	the	 destruct 	 ive 	 	power	of	nature	 it 	 self 	 	with	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 earth 	 quake 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	.
well	,	i	think	what	is	far	 wo 	 rse 	 	is	man	's	 destruct 	 ive 	 	power	over	man	.
samuel	pisar	,	an	auschwitz	 surviv 	 or 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	i	'll	quote	him	,	``	the	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	 teach 	 es 	 	us	that	nature	,	even	in	 it 	 s 	 	 cruel 	 est 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	is	benign	in	 compar 	 ison 	 	with	man	,	when	he	 lose 	 s 	 	his	moral	compass	and	his	reason	.	``
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	 crucifix 	 ion 	 	.
the	 horr 	 ifying 	 	 image 	 s 	 	from	abu	ghraib	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 image 	 s 	 	from	guantanamo	had	a	 pro 	 found 	 	impact	.
the	 public 	 ation 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	the	 image 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	government	to	change	 it 	 s 	 	 poli 	 cies 	 	.
some	would	 argu 	 e 	 	that	it	is	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	that	did	more	to	fuel	the	insurgency	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	than	 virtual 	 ly 	 	any	other	single	act	.
 further 	 more 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	moral	high	ground	of	the	 occupy 	 ing 	 	 force 	 s 	 	.
let	's	go	back	a	little	.
in	the	1960s	and	1970s	,	the	vietnam	war	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	 show 	 n 	 	in	america	's	living	rooms	day	in	,	day	out	.
news	 photo 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	people	face	to	face	with	the	 victim 	 s 	 	of	the	war	:	a	little	girl	 burn 	 ed 	 	by	 na 	 palm 	 	,	a	student	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	the	national	guard	at	kent	state	university	in	ohio	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	protest	.
in	fact	,	these	 image 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	 voice 	 s 	 	of	protest	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
now	,	 image 	 s 	 	have	power	to	shed	light	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	on	 s 	 us 	 pic 	 ion 	 	,	 ignor 	 ance 	 	,	and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	--	i	've	 give 	 n 	 	a	lot	of	 talk 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	but	i	'll	just	show	one	image	--	the	issue	of	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.
in	the	1980s	,	the	 stigma 	 t 	 ization 	 	of	people	with	the	disease	was	an	enormous	 bar 	 rier 	 	to	even	 discuss 	 ing 	 	or	 address 	 ing 	 	it	.
a	simple	act	,	in	1987	,	of	the	most	famous	woman	in	the	world	,	the	 prince 	 s 	 s 	 	of	wales	,	 touch 	 ing 	 	an	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	baby	did	a	great	deal	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	europe	,	to	stop	that	.
she	,	better	than	most	,	 k 	 new 	 	the	power	of	an	image	.
so	when	we	are	 confront 	 ed 	 	by	a	 power 	 ful 	 	image	,	we	all	have	a	choice	:	we	can	look	away	,	or	we	can	address	the	image	.
 thank 	 fully 	 	,	when	these	 photo 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	in	1998	,	they	put	a	lot	of	focus	and	attention	and	,	in	the	end	,	a	lot	of	money	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	sudan	famine	relief	 effort 	 s 	 	.
did	the	 image 	 s 	 	change	the	world	?
no	,	but	they	had	a	major	impact	.
 image 	 s 	 	often	push	us	to	question	our	core	 belief 	 s 	 	and	our	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	to	each	other	.
we	all	saw	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	after	katrina	,	and	i	think	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	they	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	impact	.
and	i	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	far	from	the	 mind 	 s 	 	of	americans	when	they	went	to	vote	in	november	2008	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 image 	 s 	 	are	 de 	 em 	 ed 	 	too	graphic	or	 disturb 	 ing 	 	for	us	to	see	them	.
i	'll	show	you	one	photo	here	,	and	it	's	a	photo	by	eugene	richards	of	an	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	veteran	from	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	piece	of	work	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	war	is	personal	.
but	 image 	 s 	 	do	n't	need	to	be	graphic	in	order	to	 re 	 mind 	 	us	of	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	war	.
john	moore	set	up	 th 	 is 	 	photo	at	arlington	 cemet 	 ery 	 	.
after	all	the	tense	 moment 	 s 	 	of	conflict	in	all	the	conflict	 zone 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	there	's	one	photograph	from	a	much	 quiet 	 er 	 	place	that	 haunt 	 s 	 	me	still	,	much	more	than	the	 other 	 s 	 	.
ansel	adams	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	disagree	with	him	,	``	you	do	n't	take	a	photograph	,	you	make	it	.	``
in	my	view	,	it	's	not	the	 photograph 	 er 	 	who	 make 	 s 	 	the	photo	,	it	's	you	.
we	 br 	 ing 	 	to	each	image	our	own	 value 	 s 	 	,	our	own	belief	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	,	the	image	 reson 	 ates 	 	with	us	.
my	company	 ha 	 s 	 	70	million	 image 	 s 	 	.
i	have	one	image	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	.
here	it	is	.
i	hope	that	the	next	time	you	see	an	image	that	 spark 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	you	,	you	'll	better	understand	why	,	and	i	know	that	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	audience	,	you	'll	 definite 	 ly 	 	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
and	thank	you	to	all	the	 photograph 	 ers 	 	.
