what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	the	climate	?
it	is	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	bad	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	that	famous	view	now	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	which	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	gone	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	the	next	three	or	four	or	five	 year 	 s 	 	.	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	.
so	we	all	look	at	what	we	can	do	.
and	when	you	look	at	the	 world 	 wide 	 	 source 	 s 	 	of	co	2	,	52	percent	are	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	 building 	 s 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	nine	percent	is	passenger	 car 	 s 	 	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.
so	we	ran	off	to	a	sushi	bar	.
and	at	that	sushi	bar	we	came	up	with	a	great	idea	.
and	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	ecorock	.
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	we	could	 re 	 design 	 	the	115	-	year	-	old	 gy 	 ps 	 um 	 	 dry 	 wall 	 	process	that	 generate 	 s 	 	20	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	of	co	2	a	year	.
so	it	was	a	big	idea	.	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	that	by	80	percent	,	which	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	r	&	d	in	2006	.
 decide 	 d 	 	to	use	 recycl 	 ed 	 	content	from	cement	and	steel	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
there	is	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	our	lab	.	we	have	n't	 show 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	.
but	our	people	had	to	do	some	5,000	different	 mix 	 es 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	right	,	to	hit	our	 target 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 work 	 ed 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
so	then	we	went	forward	and	built	our	production	line	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
we	do	n't	build	 th 	 is 	 	production	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	any	 long 	 er 	 	in	the	u.s.	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	.
we	did	the	line	install	over	the	summer	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	right	there	,	with	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	for	the	first	time	,	a	brand	new	 dry 	 wall 	 	production	line	,	not	made	using	 gy 	 ps 	 um 	 	at	all	.
that	's	the	 finish 	 ed 	 	production	line	there	.
we	got	our	first	 pan 	 el 	 	out	on	december	third	.
that	is	the	 slur 	 ry 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 pour 	 ed 	 	onto	paper	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.	that	's	the	line	running	.
the	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	is	,	look	at	the	 face 	 s 	 	of	the	people	.
these	are	people	who	 work 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	for	two	to	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	they	are	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	that	's	the	first	board	off	the	line	.
our	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	of	operation	 kiss 	 ing 	 	the	board	.	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	huge	,	huge	impact	on	the	environment	.
we	 sign 	 ed 	 	the	first	 pan 	 el 	 	just	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	after	that	,	had	a	great	 sign 	 ing 	 	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	people	 hope 	 fully 	 	using	these	 product 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
and	we	've	got	cradle	-	to	-	cradle	gold	on	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
we	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	win	,	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	the	green	product	of	the	year	for	``	the	re	-	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	 dry 	 wall 	 	,	``	from	popular	science	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
so	here	is	what	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	:	8,000	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	gas	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	build	one	house	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	had	no	idea	.	it	's	like	 driv 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	six	 time 	 s 	 	.
we	must	change	 every 	 thing 	 	.
look	around	the	room	:	 chair 	 s 	 	,	wood	,	 every 	 thing 	 	around	us	 ha 	 s 	 	to	change	or	we	're	not	going	to	lick	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
do	n't	listen	to	the	people	who	say	you	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 any 	 one 	 	can	.
and	these	job	 loss 	 es 	 	,	we	can	fix	them	with	green	-	collar	 job 	 s 	 	.
we	've	got	four	 plant 	 s 	 	.	we	're	building	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	around	the	country	.
we	're	going	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	.
two	and	a	half	million	 car 	 s 	 	worth	of	 gy 	 ps 	 um 	 	,	you	know	,	co	2	generated	.	right	?
so	what	will	you	do	?	i	'll	tell	you	what	i	did	and	why	i	did	it	.	and	i	know	my	time	's	up	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	my	 kid 	 s 	 	,	natalie	and	david	.
when	they	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	2050	,	they	'd	better	look	back	at	grandpa	and	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	 g 	 ave 	 	it	a	good	shot	.	you	did	the	best	you	could	with	the	team	that	you	had	.	``
so	my	hope	is	that	when	you	 leav 	 e 	 	ted	,	you	will	look	at	 reduc 	 ing 	 	your	carbon	 foot 	 print 	 	in	 how 	 ever 	 	you	can	do	it	.
and	if	you	do	n't	know	how	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	find	me	--	i	will	help	you	.
last	but	not	 l 	 east 	 	,	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	,	i	know	you	 invent 	 ed 	 	 window 	 s 	 	.
wait	till	you	see	,	 may 	 be 	 	next	year	,	what	kind	of	 window 	 s 	 	we	've	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
thank	you	so	much	.
