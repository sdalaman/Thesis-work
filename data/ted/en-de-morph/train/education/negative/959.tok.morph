now	,	since	 th 	 is 	 	is	tedglobal	,	who	can	tell	me	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	in	french	?
i	see	you	're	all	up	on	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	hurdy	-	gurdy	--	``	 vi 	 elle 	 	Ã 	 rou 	 e 	 	.	``
and	in	spanish	,	``	zanfona	.	``
and	in	italian	,	``	ghironda	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
hurdy	-	gurdy	,	or	wheel	 fiddl 	 e 	 	.
so	,	these	are	the	different	 kind 	 s 	 	and	 shape 	 s 	 	of	the	hurdy	-	gurdy	.
the	hurdy	-	gurdy	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	musical	instrument	that	uses	a	crank	to	turn	a	wheel	to	rub	 string 	 s 	 	,	like	the	bow	of	a	 viol 	 in 	 	,	to	produce	music	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	three	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 string 	 s 	 	.
the	first	string	is	the	drone	string	,	which	 play 	 s 	 	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	sound	like	the	 bag 	 pipe 	 	.
the	second	string	is	a	 melo 	 dy 	 	string	,	which	is	 play 	 ed 	 	with	a	 wood 	 en 	 	 key 	 board 	 	tuned	like	a	piano	.
and	the	third	string	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	instrument	that	uses	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 techni 	 que 	 	.
it	 activate 	 s 	 	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 buzz 	 ing 	 	bridge	,	or	the	dog	.
when	i	turn	the	crank	and	i	 app 	 ly 	 	pressure	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	sound	like	a	 bark 	 ing 	 	dog	.
so	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	if	you	consider	that	the	hurdy	-	gurdy	 appear 	 ed 	 	about	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	it	took	two	people	to	play	it	;	one	to	turn	the	crank	,	and	 an 	 other 	 	person	--	 y 	 es 	 	--	to	play	the	 melo 	 dy 	 	by	 physical 	 ly 	 	 pull 	 ing 	 	up	large	 wood 	 en 	 	 peg 	 s 	 	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 change 	 d 	 	a	couple	of	centuries	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	,	one	person	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	play	and	 al 	 most 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	heavy	--	carry	the	hurdy	-	gurdy	.
the	hurdy	-	gurdy	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	used	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	through	the	centuries	in	 most 	 ly 	 	dance	music	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 un 	 ique 	 ness 	 	of	the	 melo 	 dy 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	with	the	acoustic	 boom 	 box 	 	here	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	hurdy	-	gurdy	is	used	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	music	--	 tradition 	 al 	 	folk	music	,	dance	,	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	and	world	music	--	in	the	u.k.	,	in	france	,	in	spain	and	in	italy	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	hurdy	-	gurdy	 take 	 s 	 	 any 	 where 	 	from	three	to	five	 year 	 s 	 	[	to	order	and	 receiv 	 e 	 	it	]	.
it	's	made	by	 special 	 ized 	 	 luthi 	 ers 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	in	europe	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	tune	.
so	 with 	 out 	 	further	ado	,	would	you	like	to	hear	it	?
caroline	phillips	:	i	did	n't	hear	you	.	would	you	like	to	hear	it	?
