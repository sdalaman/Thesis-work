 a 	 s 	 	an	indian	,	and	now	 a 	 s 	 	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	and	a	government	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 come 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	the	hype	we	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	our	own	country	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	talk	about	india	 be 	 coming 	 	a	world	 lead 	 er 	 	,	even	the	next	 super 	 power 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	american	 publish 	 ers 	 	of	my	book	,	``	the	elephant	,	the	tiger	and	the	cell	phone	,	``	 add 	 ed 	 	a	gratuitous	 sub 	 title 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	india	:	the	next	21st	-	century	power	.	``
and	i	just	do	n't	think	that	's	what	india	's	all	about	,	or	should	be	all	about	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	what	 worri 	 es 	 	me	is	the	entire	 not 	 ion 	 	of	world	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 arch 	 a 	 ic 	 	.
it	's	redolent	of	james	bond	 movie 	 s 	 	and	kipling	 ball 	 ad 	 s 	 	.
after	all	,	what	 constitute 	 s 	 	a	world	 lead 	 er 	 	?
if	it	's	population	,	we	're	on	course	to	top	the	 chart 	 s 	 	.
we	will	 over 	 take 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	by	2034	.
is	it	 militar 	 y 	 	strength	?	well	,	we	have	the	world	's	fourth	largest	 arm 	 y 	 	.
is	it	nuclear	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	?	we	know	we	have	that	.
the	americans	have	even	 recogn 	 ized 	 	it	,	in	an	 agree 	 ment 	 	.
is	it	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	?	well	,	we	have	now	the	fifth	-	largest	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	the	world	in	 pur 	 chasing 	 	power	 par 	 ity 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	grow	.	when	the	rest	of	the	world	took	a	 beat 	 ing 	 	last	year	,	we	grew	at	6.7	percent	.
but	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	that	 add 	 s 	 	up	to	me	,	to	what	i	think	india	 re 	 ally 	 	can	aim	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	in	the	world	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	21st	century	.
and	so	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	could	what	the	future	 beck 	 on 	 s 	 	for	india	to	be	all	about	be	a	combination	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 all 	 ied 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	the	power	of	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 attract 	 ion 	 	of	india	's	culture	,	what	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	people	like	to	call	``	soft	power	.	``
soft	power	is	a	 con 	 cept 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	a	harvard	academic	,	joseph	nye	,	a	friend	of	mine	.
and	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	cutting	it	short	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	time	 limit 	 s 	 	here	,	it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	ability	of	a	country	to	attract	 other 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	culture	,	 it 	 s 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 value 	 s 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	foreign	 poli 	 cies 	 	.
and	,	you	know	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	he	was	writing	 initi 	 ally 	 	about	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	but	we	know	the	alliance	 franc 	 a 	 ise 	 	is	all	about	french	soft	power	,	the	british	council	.
the	beijing	olympics	 we 	 re 	 	an	 exercis 	 e 	 	in	chinese	soft	power	.
americans	have	the	voice	of	america	and	the	fulbright	 scholar 	 ship 	 s 	 	.
but	,	the	fact	is	,	in	fact	,	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	hollywood	and	mtv	and	mcdonalds	have	 d 	 one 	 	more	for	american	soft	power	around	the	world	than	any	 specific 	 ally 	 	government	activity	.
so	soft	power	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 emerge 	 s 	 	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 government 	 s 	 	,	but	 part 	 ly 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	 government 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	information	era	we	all	live	in	 to 	 day 	 	,	what	we	might	call	the	ted	age	,	i	'd	say	that	 count 	 ries 	 	are	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 judg 	 ed 	 	by	a	global	public	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	fed	on	an	incessant	diet	of	 inter 	 net 	 	news	,	of	televised	 image 	 s 	 	,	of	 cell 	 phone 	 	 video 	 s 	 	,	of	email	gossip	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	communication	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	the	 count 	 ries 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	want	people	to	hear	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
now	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	age	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 count 	 ries 	 	with	access	to	 multi 	 ple 	 	 channel 	 s 	 	of	communication	and	information	have	a	 part 	 icular 	 	advantage	.
and	of	course	they	have	more	influence	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	about	how	they	're	 s 	 een 	 	.
india	 ha 	 s 	 	more	all	-	news	tv	 channel 	 s 	 	than	any	country	in	the	world	,	in	fact	in	most	of	the	 count 	 ries 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	put	together	.
but	,	the	fact	still	is	that	it	's	not	just	that	.
in	order	to	have	soft	power	,	you	have	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
one	might	 argu 	 e 	 	that	india	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	an	 astonish 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	country	.
i	think	you	've	 al 	 ready 	 	heard	the	 figure 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	selling	15	million	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	a	month	.
 current 	 ly 	 	there	are	509	million	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	in	indian	 hand 	 s 	 	,	in	india	.
and	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	 large 	 r 	 	than	the	u.s.	 a 	 s 	 	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	market	.
in	fact	,	 t 	 hose 	 	15	million	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	are	the	most	 connect 	 ions 	 	that	any	country	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	u.s.	and	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 establish 	 ed 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	.
but	,	what	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	of	you	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	is	how	far	we	've	come	to	get	there	.
you	know	,	when	i	grew	up	in	india	,	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	 r 	 arity 	 	.
in	fact	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	rare	that	 elect 	 ed 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	parliament	had	the	right	to	 al 	 locate 	 	15	 tele 	 phone 	 	lines	 a 	 s 	 	a	favor	to	 t 	 hose 	 	they	 de 	 em 	 ed 	 	worthy	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	a	 wealth 	 y 	 	 business 	 man 	 	or	an	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	journalist	,	or	a	doctor	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	might	have	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	.
but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	just	 s 	 at 	 	there	.
i	went	to	high	school	in	calcutta	.
and	we	would	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	instrument	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	front	foyer	.
but	half	the	time	we	would	pick	it	up	with	an	 expect 	 ant 	 	look	on	our	 face 	 s 	 	,	there	would	be	no	dial	tone	.
if	there	was	a	dial	tone	and	you	 dial 	 ed 	 	a	number	,	the	 odd 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	two	in	three	you	would	n't	get	the	number	you	 we 	 re 	 	 intend 	 ing 	 	to	reach	.
in	fact	the	 word 	 s 	 	``	wrong	number	``	 we 	 re 	 	more	popular	than	the	word	``	 hell 	 o 	 	.	``
if	you	then	 want 	 ed 	 	to	connect	to	 an 	 other 	 	city	,	let	's	say	from	calcutta	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	call	delhi	,	you	'd	have	to	book	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	trunk	call	,	and	then	 s 	 it 	 	by	the	phone	all	day	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	it	to	come	through	.
or	you	could	pay	eight	 time 	 s 	 	the	going	rate	for	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 light 	 ning 	 	call	.
but	,	 light 	 ning 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	in	our	country	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	so	,	it	was	like	about	a	half	an	hour	for	a	 light 	 ning 	 	call	to	come	through	.
in	fact	,	so	woeful	was	our	 tele 	 phone 	 	service	that	a	member	of	parliament	stood	up	in	1984	and	 complain 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	then	-	 communication 	 s 	 	 mini 	 ster 	 	 re 	 plied 	 	in	a	lordly	manner	that	in	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	 communication 	 s 	 	are	a	 luxur 	 y 	 	,	not	a	right	,	that	the	government	had	no	 oblig 	 ation 	 	to	provide	better	service	,	and	if	the	 honor 	 able 	 	member	was	n't	satisfied	with	his	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	could	he	 pleas 	 e 	 	return	it	,	since	there	was	an	eight	-	year	-	long	 wait 	 ing 	 	list	for	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	in	india	.
now	,	fast	-	forward	to	 to 	 day 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	see	:	the	15	million	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	a	month	.
but	what	is	most	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	is	who	is	 carry 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	if	you	visit	 friend 	 s 	 	in	the	 suburb 	 s 	 	of	delhi	,	on	the	side	 street 	 s 	 	you	will	find	a	fellow	with	a	cart	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	was	designed	in	the	16th	century	,	 wield 	 ing 	 	a	coal	-	 fire 	 d 	 	 s 	 team 	 	iron	that	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	the	18th	century	.
he	's	 call 	 ed 	 	an	isthri	wala	.	but	he	's	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	21st	-	century	instrument	.
he	's	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	cell	phone	 be 	 cause 	 	most	 in 	 coming 	 	 call 	 s 	 	are	free	,	and	that	's	how	he	 get 	 s 	 	 order 	 s 	 	from	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	to	know	where	to	collect	 clothe 	 s 	 	to	get	them	ironed	.
the	other	day	i	was	in	kerala	,	my	home	state	,	at	the	country	farm	of	a	friend	,	about	20	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	from	any	place	you	'd	consider	urban	.
and	it	was	a	hot	day	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	would	you	like	some	fresh	coconut	water	?	``
and	it	's	the	best	thing	and	the	most	 nut 	 rit 	 ious 	 	and	 re 	 fresh 	 ing 	 	thing	you	can	drink	on	a	hot	day	in	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	,	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
and	he	 whip 	 ped 	 	out	his	 cell 	 phone 	 	,	 dial 	 ed 	 	the	number	,	and	a	voice	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	up	here	.	``
and	right	on	top	of	the	 near 	 est 	 	coconut	tree	,	with	a	hatchet	in	one	hand	and	a	cell	phone	in	the	other	,	was	a	local	toddy	tapper	,	who	 proceed 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	down	the	coconuts	for	us	to	drink	.
 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	are	going	out	to	sea	and	 carry 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	.
when	they	catch	the	fish	they	call	all	the	market	 town 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	coast	to	find	out	where	they	get	the	best	possible	 price 	 s 	 	.
 farm 	 ers 	 	now	,	who	used	to	have	to	 s 	 pend 	 	half	a	day	of	backbreaking	labor	to	find	out	if	the	market	town	was	open	,	if	the	market	was	on	,	 whet 	 her 	 	the	product	they	'd	 harvest 	 ed 	 	could	be	 s 	 old 	 	,	what	price	they	'd	fetch	.
they	'd	often	 s 	 end 	 	an	eight	year	old	boy	all	the	way	on	 th 	 is 	 	trudge	to	the	market	town	to	get	that	information	and	come	back	,	then	they	'd	load	the	cart	.
 to 	 day 	 	they	're	saving	half	a	day	's	labor	with	a	two	minute	phone	call	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 empower 	 ment 	 	of	the	underclass	is	the	real	result	of	india	 be 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	 transform 	 ation 	 	is	part	of	where	india	is	 head 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	,	of	course	that	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	about	india	that	's	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
you	've	got	bollywood	.	my	attitude	to	bollywood	is	best	 summarize 	 d 	 	in	the	tale	of	the	two	 goat 	 s 	 	at	a	bollywood	garbage	dump	--	mr.	shekhar	kapur	,	forgive	me	--	and	they	're	 chew 	 ing 	 	away	on	 can 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 ul 	 oid 	 	 dis 	 card 	 ed 	 	by	a	bollywood	studio	.
and	the	first	goat	,	 chew 	 ing 	 	away	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	film	is	not	bad	.	``
and	the	second	goat	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	no	,	the	book	was	better	.	``
i	 usual 	 ly 	 	tend	to	think	that	the	book	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	better	,	but	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	the	fact	is	that	bollywood	is	now	taking	a	certain	 a 	 spect 	 	of	indian	-	ness	and	indian	culture	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	not	just	in	the	indian	diaspora	in	the	u.s.	and	the	u.k.	,	but	to	the	 screen 	 s 	 	of	arabs	and	africans	,	of	senegalese	and	syrians	.
i	've	met	a	young	man	in	new	york	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	illiterate	mother	in	a	village	in	senegal	 take 	 s 	 	a	bus	once	a	month	to	the	capital	city	of	dakar	,	just	to	watch	a	bollywood	movie	.
she	ca	n't	understand	the	 dial 	 ogue 	 	.
she	's	illiterate	,	so	she	ca	n't	read	the	french	 sub 	 title 	 s 	 	.
but	these	 movie 	 s 	 	are	made	to	be	 under 	 stood 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	handicaps	,	and	she	 ha 	 s 	 	a	great	time	in	the	song	and	the	dance	and	the	action	.
she	 go 	 es 	 	away	with	 star 	 s 	 	in	her	 eye 	 s 	 	about	india	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	.
afghanistan	,	we	know	what	a	serious	security	problem	afghanistan	is	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	in	the	world	.
india	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	 militar 	 y 	 	mission	there	.
you	know	what	was	india	's	 big 	 gest 	 	asset	in	afghanistan	in	the	last	seven	 year 	 s 	 	?
one	simple	fact	:	you	could	n't	try	to	call	an	afghan	at	8:30	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	that	was	the	moment	when	the	indian	 tele 	 vision 	 	soap	opera	,	``	kyunki	saas	bhi	kabhi	bahu	thi	,	``	 dub 	 bed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	dari	,	was	telecast	on	tolo	t.v	.
and	it	was	the	most	popular	 tele 	 vision 	 	show	in	afghan	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
every	afghan	family	 want 	 ed 	 	to	watch	it	.
they	had	to	suspend	 function 	 s 	 	at	8:30	.
 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	to	be	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	so	 guest 	 s 	 	could	cluster	around	the	t.v	.	set	,	and	then	turn	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	back	to	the	 brid 	 e 	 	and	groom	.
crime	went	up	at	8:30	.	i	have	read	a	reuters	 dis 	 patch 	 	--	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	indian	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	,	a	british	news	 age 	 ncy 	 	--	about	how	 robber 	 s 	 	in	the	town	of	musarri	sharif	*	 strip 	 ped 	 	a	vehicle	of	 it 	 s 	 	 wind 	 shield 	 	wipers	,	 it 	 s 	 	hubcaps	,	 it 	 s 	 	sideview	 mirror 	 s 	 	,	any	moving	part	they	could	find	,	at	8:30	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	watchmen	 we 	 re 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	t.v	.	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 mind 	 ing 	 	the	store	.
and	they	scrawled	on	the	 wind 	 shield 	 	in	a	 re 	 ference 	 	to	the	show	's	 hero 	 ine 	 	,	``	tulsi	zindabad	``	:	``	long	live	tulsi	.	``
that	's	soft	power	.	and	that	is	what	india	is	 develop 	 ing 	 	through	the	``	e	``	part	of	ted	:	 it 	 s 	 	own	 entertain 	 ment 	 	industry	.
the	same	is	true	,	of	course	--	we	do	n't	have	time	for	too	 man 	 y 	 	more	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	--	but	it	's	true	of	our	music	,	of	our	dance	,	of	our	art	,	 y 	 oga 	 	,	ayurveda	,	even	indian	 cu 	 is 	 ine 	 	.
i	mean	,	the	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	of	indian	 restaurant 	 s 	 	since	i	first	went	 a 	 broad 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	student	,	in	the	mid	'70s	,	and	what	i	see	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	ca	n't	go	to	a	mid	-	 s 	 ize 	 	town	in	europe	or	north	america	and	not	find	an	indian	restaurant	.	it	may	not	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	one	.
but	,	 to 	 day 	 	in	britain	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	indian	 restaurant 	 s 	 	in	britain	employ	more	people	than	the	coal	 min 	 ing 	 	,	ship	building	and	iron	and	steel	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	.
so	the	empire	can	strike	back	.
but	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	increasing	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	india	,	with	you	and	with	i	,	and	so	on	,	with	 tale 	 s 	 	like	afghanistan	,	 come 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	vital	in	the	information	era	,	the	sense	that	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	world	it	's	not	the	side	of	the	 big 	 ger 	 	 arm 	 y 	 	that	 win 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	country	that	 tell 	 s 	 	a	better	story	that	prevails	.
and	india	is	,	and	must	remain	,	in	my	view	,	the	land	of	the	better	story	.
 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	are	changing	.	i	mean	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	gone	to	the	u.s	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	student	in	the	mid	'70s	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	what	the	image	of	india	was	then	,	if	there	was	an	image	at	all	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	people	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	and	 else 	 where 	 	speak	of	the	iits	,	the	indian	 institute 	 s 	 	of	technology	with	the	same	reverence	they	used	to	accord	to	mit	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	have	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.	ok	.
i	had	a	friend	,	a	 histo 	 ry 	 	major	like	me	,	who	was	 ac 	 cost 	 ed 	 	at	schiphol	 air 	 port 	 	in	amsterdam	,	by	an	anxiously	perspiring	european	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	you	're	indian	,	you	're	indian	!	can	you	help	me	fix	my	 lap 	 top 	 	?	``
we	've	gone	from	the	image	of	india	 a 	 s 	 	land	of	fakirs	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	 bed 	 s 	 	of	 nail 	 s 	 	,	and	snake	charmers	with	the	indian	rope	trick	,	to	the	image	of	india	 a 	 s 	 	a	land	of	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	,	computer	 wizard 	 s 	 	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	 guru 	 s 	 	.
but	that	too	is	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	indian	story	around	the	world	.
but	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	more	substantive	to	that	.
the	story	 rest 	 s 	 	on	a	fundamental	platform	of	 politic 	 al 	 	pluralism	.
it	's	a	 civil 	 ization 	 al 	 	story	to	begin	with	.
 be 	 cause 	 	india	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	open	 socie 	 ty 	 	for	millennia	.
india	 g 	 ave 	 	refuge	to	the	jews	,	 flee 	 ing 	 	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	first	temple	by	the	babylonians	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	 there 	 after 	 	by	the	romans	.
in	fact	,	legend	 ha 	 s 	 	is	that	when	 doubt 	 ing 	 	thomas	,	the	apostle	,	saint	thomas	,	 land 	 ed 	 	on	the	 shore 	 s 	 	of	kerala	,	my	home	state	,	 some 	 where 	 	around	52	a.d.	,	he	was	 welcome 	 d 	 	on	shore	by	a	 flut 	 e 	 	-	 play 	 ing 	 	jewish	girl	.
and	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	 remain 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	jewish	diaspora	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	jewish	people	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	a	single	incident	of	anti	-	semitism	.
that	's	the	indian	story	.
islam	came	 peace 	 fully 	 	to	the	south	,	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	 different 	 ly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	the	north	.
but	all	of	these	 relig 	 ions 	 	have	found	a	place	and	a	welcome	home	in	india	.
you	know	,	we	just	 celebr 	 ated 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	our	general	 election 	 s 	 	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	in	 democrat 	 ic 	 	franchise	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	the	next	one	will	be	even	 big 	 ger 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 vot 	 ing 	 	population	 keep 	 s 	 	growing	by	20	million	a	year	.
but	,	the	fact	is	that	the	last	 election 	 s 	 	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 g 	 ave 	 	the	world	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	an	election	 be 	 ing 	 	won	by	a	woman	 politic 	 al 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	of	italian	origin	and	roman	catholic	faith	,	sonia	gandhi	,	who	then	made	way	for	a	sikh	,	mohan	singh	,	to	be	 s 	 worn 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	by	a	muslim	,	 p 	 resident 	 	abdul	kalam	,	in	a	country	81	percent	hindu	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	india	,	and	of	course	it	's	all	the	more	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	four	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	that	we	all	 applaud 	 ed 	 	the	u.s.	,	the	 old 	 est 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	the	modern	world	,	more	than	220	 year 	 s 	 	of	free	and	fair	 election 	 s 	 	,	which	took	till	last	year	to	elect	a	 p 	 resident 	 	or	a	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	who	was	n't	white	,	male	or	christian	.
so	,	 may 	 be 	 	--	oh	sorry	,	he	is	christian	,	i	beg	your	 par 	 don 	 	--	and	he	is	male	,	but	he	is	n't	white	.
all	the	 other 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	three	.
all	his	predecessors	have	 be 	 en 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	three	,	and	that	's	the	point	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	.
but	,	the	issue	is	that	when	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	that	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	it	's	not	just	about	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	india	,	it	's	not	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	that	 elect 	 or 	 al 	 	 out 	 come 	 	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	the	rest	of	the	world	.
it	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	india	 be 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 work 	 s 	 	better	than	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
 government 	 s 	 	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 tell 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
but	people	see	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	for	what	it	is	,	and	that	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	is	what	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	will	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	information	era	,	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	ted	age	.
so	india	now	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	 national 	 ism 	 	of	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	or	language	or	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	every	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	known	to	 man 	 kind 	 	,	 practical 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	every	 relig 	 ion 	 	know	to	 man 	 kind 	 	,	with	the	possible	exception	of	shintoism	,	 th 	 ough 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	some	hindu	 element 	 s 	 	 some 	 where 	 	.
we	have	23	official	 language 	 s 	 	that	are	 recogn 	 ized 	 	in	our	 constit 	 ution 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	 cash 	 ed 	 	your	money	here	might	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	see	how	 man 	 y 	 	 script 	 s 	 	there	are	on	the	rupee	note	,	 spell 	 ing 	 	out	the	 denomi 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
we	've	got	all	of	that	.
we	do	n't	even	have	 geo 	 graphy 	 	 unit 	 ing 	 	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	natural	 geo 	 graphy 	 	of	the	subcontinent	 frame 	 d 	 	by	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	and	the	sea	was	 hack 	 ed 	 	by	the	 part 	 ition 	 	with	pakistan	in	1947	.
in	fact	,	you	ca	n't	even	take	the	name	of	the	country	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	name	``	india	``	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	river	indus	,	which	 flow 	 s 	 	in	pakistan	.
but	,	the	whole	point	is	that	india	is	the	 national 	 ism 	 	of	an	idea	.
it	's	the	idea	of	an	ever	-	ever	-	land	,	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	an	ancient	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	 unit 	 ed 	 	by	a	 share 	 d 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	but	 sustain 	 ed 	 	,	above	all	,	by	pluralist	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
that	is	a	21st	-	century	story	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	an	ancient	one	.
and	it	's	the	 national 	 ism 	 	of	an	idea	that	 essential 	 ly 	 	 say 	 s 	 	you	can	 endur 	 e 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	of	 cast 	 e 	 	,	 cre 	 ed 	 	,	color	,	culture	,	 cu 	 is 	 ine 	 	,	custom	and	 cost 	 ume 	 	,	 con 	 son 	 ant 	 	,	for	that	matter	,	and	still	 r 	 ally 	 	around	a	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	.
and	the	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	is	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	principle	,	that	in	a	 divers 	 e 	 	plural	 demo 	 cracy 	 	like	india	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	agree	on	 every 	 thing 	 	all	the	time	,	so	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	agree	on	the	ground	 rule 	 s 	 	of	how	you	will	disagree	.
the	great	success	story	of	india	,	a	country	that	so	 man 	 y 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	 scholar 	 s 	 	and	 journalist 	 s 	 	 assum 	 ed 	 	would	 dis 	 integrate 	 	,	in	the	'50s	and	'60s	,	is	that	it	 manage 	 d 	 	to	maintain	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	on	how	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	.
now	,	that	is	the	india	that	is	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	21st	century	.
and	i	do	want	to	make	the	point	that	if	there	is	 any 	 thing 	 	worth	 celebr 	 ating 	 	about	india	,	it	is	n't	 militar 	 y 	 	muscle	,	economic	power	.
all	of	that	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	,	but	we	still	have	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	to	 over 	 come 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	we	are	super	poor	,	and	we	are	 al 	 so 	 	super	power	.
we	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	be	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
we	have	to	 over 	 come 	 	our	poverty	.	we	have	to	deal	with	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	the	 port 	 s 	 	,	the	 road 	 s 	 	,	the	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 infra 	 structural 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	need	to	do	,	and	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	the	human	capital	,	the	need	for	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	person	in	india	to	be	able	to	have	a	couple	of	square	 meal 	 s 	 	a	day	,	to	be	able	to	 s 	 end 	 	his	or	her	children	to	a	 de 	 cent 	 	school	,	and	to	 aspir 	 e 	 	to	work	a	job	that	will	give	them	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	that	can	transform	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	,	it	's	all	taking	place	,	 th 	 is 	 	great	adventure	of	 conquer 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	real	 challeng 	 es 	 	which	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	can	pretend	do	n't	exist	.
but	,	it	's	all	taking	place	in	an	open	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	in	a	rich	and	 divers 	 e 	 	and	plural	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	in	one	that	is	 determine 	 d 	 	to	liberate	and	fulfill	the	creative	 energ 	 ies 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	people	.
that	's	why	india	 belong 	 s 	 	at	ted	,	and	that	's	why	ted	 belong 	 s 	 	in	india	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
