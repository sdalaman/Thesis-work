how	do	you	 observ 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	you	ca	n't	see	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	question	of	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 find 	 ing 	 	and	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	 object 	 s 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	pull	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	is	so	 intens 	 e 	 	that	 noth 	 ing 	 	can	 es 	 cape 	 	it	,	not	even	light	,	so	you	ca	n't	see	it	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	my	story	 to 	 day 	 	about	black	 hole 	 s 	 	is	about	one	 part 	 icular 	 	black	hole	.
i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 find 	 ing 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	there	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	massive	,	what	we	like	to	call	``	supermassive	``	black	hole	at	the	center	of	our	 galax 	 y 	 	.
and	the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	prove	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	these	 ex 	 otic 	 	 object 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	exist	.
and	second	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	understand	how	these	supermassive	black	 hole 	 s 	 	interact	with	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	,	and	to	understand	how	they	affect	the	 form 	 ation 	 	and	evolution	of	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	which	they	 re 	 side 	 	in	.
so	,	to	begin	with	,	we	need	to	understand	what	a	black	hole	is	so	we	can	understand	the	proof	of	a	black	hole	.
so	,	what	is	a	black	hole	?
well	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	a	black	hole	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	simple	object	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	three	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	that	you	can	 de 	 scribe 	 	:	the	mass	,	the	spin	,	and	the	charge	.
and	i	'm	going	to	 on 	 ly 	 	talk	about	the	mass	.
so	,	in	that	sense	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	object	.
but	in	 an 	 other 	 	sense	,	it	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	object	that	we	need	 relat 	 ively 	 	 ex 	 otic 	 	physics	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	,	and	in	some	sense	 represent 	 s 	 	the	 break 	 down 	 	of	our	physical	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	way	i	want	you	to	understand	a	black	hole	,	for	the	proof	of	a	black	hole	,	is	to	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	object	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	mass	is	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	to	zero	volume	.
so	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	an	object	that	's	supermassive	,	and	i	'm	going	to	get	to	what	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	in	a	moment	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 fin 	 ite 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	 trick 	 y 	 	.
but	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	there	is	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	that	you	can	see	,	and	that	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	schwarzschild	 radi 	 us 	 	.
and	that	's	named	after	the	guy	who	 recogn 	 ized 	 	why	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 radi 	 us 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	virtual	 radi 	 us 	 	,	not	 re 	 ality 	 	;	the	black	hole	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 s 	 ize 	 	.
so	why	is	it	so	 import 	 ant 	 	?
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	any	object	can	 be 	 come 	 	a	black	hole	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	you	,	your	neighbor	,	your	 cell 	 phone 	 	,	the	 audit 	 orium 	 	can	 be 	 come 	 	a	black	hole	if	you	can	figure	out	how	to	compress	it	down	to	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	schwarzschild	 radi 	 us 	 	.
at	that	point	,	what	's	going	to	happen	?
at	that	point	 gravit 	 y 	 	 win 	 s 	 	.
 gravit 	 y 	 	 win 	 s 	 	over	all	other	known	 force 	 s 	 	.
and	the	object	is	 force 	 d 	 	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	collapse	to	an	 infinite 	 ly 	 	small	object	.
and	then	it	's	a	black	hole	.
so	,	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	compress	the	earth	down	to	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	sugar	cube	,	it	would	 be 	 come 	 	a	black	hole	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	sugar	cube	is	 it 	 s 	 	schwarzschild	 radi 	 us 	 	.
now	,	the	key	here	is	to	figure	out	what	that	schwarzschild	 radi 	 us 	 	is	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	to	figure	out	.
it	 depend 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	on	the	mass	of	the	object	.
 big 	 ger 	 	 object 	 s 	 	have	 big 	 ger 	 	schwarzschild	 radi 	 i 	 	.
 small 	 er 	 	 object 	 s 	 	have	 small 	 er 	 	schwarzschild	 radi 	 i 	 	.
so	,	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	take	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	compress	it	down	to	the	scale	of	the	university	of	oxford	,	it	would	 be 	 come 	 	a	black	hole	.
so	,	now	we	know	what	a	schwarzschild	 radi 	 us 	 	is	.
and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 use 	 ful 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	not	 on 	 ly 	 	when	a	black	hole	will	form	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	key	 element 	 s 	 	for	the	proof	of	a	black	hole	.
i	 on 	 ly 	 	need	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	need	to	understand	the	mass	of	the	object	i	'm	 claim 	 ing 	 	is	a	black	hole	,	and	what	 it 	 s 	 	schwarzschild	 radi 	 us 	 	is	.
and	since	the	mass	 determine 	 s 	 	the	schwarzschild	 radi 	 us 	 	,	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	thing	i	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	know	.
so	,	my	job	in	convincing	you	that	there	is	a	black	hole	is	to	show	that	there	is	some	object	that	's	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	to	 with 	 in 	 	 it 	 s 	 	schwarzschild	 radi 	 us 	 	.
and	your	job	 to 	 day 	 	is	to	be	 skeptic 	 al 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	,	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	no	 ordin 	 ary 	 	black	hole	;	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	supermassive	black	 hole 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	about	what	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	black	hole	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	there	could	be	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	black	hole	.
an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	black	hole	is	thought	to	be	the	end	state	of	a	 re 	 ally 	 	massive	star	's	life	.
so	,	if	a	star	 start 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	life	off	with	much	more	mass	than	the	mass	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	it	's	going	to	end	 it 	 s 	 	life	by	 expl 	 o 	 d 	 ing 	 	and	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	supernova	 remnant 	 s 	 	that	we	see	here	.
and	 in 	 side 	 	that	supernova	remnant	is	going	to	be	a	little	black	hole	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mass	 rough 	 ly 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
on	an	astronomical	scale	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	black	hole	.
now	,	what	i	want	to	talk	about	are	the	supermassive	black	 hole 	 s 	 	.
and	the	supermassive	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	thought	to	 re 	 side 	 	at	the	center	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	picture	taken	with	the	hubble	space	 tele 	 scope 	 	 show 	 s 	 	you	that	 galax 	 ies 	 	come	in	all	 shape 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	.
there	are	big	 one 	 s 	 	.	there	are	little	 one 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 most 	 	every	object	in	that	picture	there	is	a	 galax 	 y 	 	.
and	there	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	spiral	up	in	the	upper	left	.
and	there	are	a	hundred	billion	 star 	 s 	 	in	that	 galax 	 y 	 	,	just	to	give	you	a	sense	of	scale	.
and	all	the	light	that	we	see	from	a	typical	 galax 	 y 	 	,	which	is	the	kind	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	that	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	,	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	light	from	the	 star 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	see	the	 galax 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	star	light	.
now	,	there	are	a	few	 relat 	 ively 	 	 ex 	 otic 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
i	like	to	call	these	the	prima	donna	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	kind	of	show	offs	.
and	we	call	them	active	galactic	nuclei	.
and	we	call	them	that	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	nucleus	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	center	,	are	 ver 	 y 	 	active	.
so	,	at	the	center	there	,	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	where	most	of	the	 star 	 light 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	from	.
and	yet	,	what	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	is	light	that	ca	n't	be	 explain 	 ed 	 	by	the	 star 	 light 	 	.
it	's	way	more	 energ 	 etic 	 	.
in	fact	,	in	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	it	's	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	.
there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 jet 	 s 	 	 e 	 man 	 ating 	 	out	from	the	center	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	source	of	energy	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	explain	if	you	just	think	that	 galax 	 ies 	 	are	 compose 	 d 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	.
so	,	what	people	have	thought	is	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	are	supermassive	black	 hole 	 s 	 	which	matter	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	on	to	.
so	,	you	ca	n't	see	the	black	hole	 it 	 self 	 	,	but	you	can	convert	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	energy	of	the	black	hole	 in 	 to 	 	the	light	we	see	.
so	,	there	is	the	thought	that	 may 	 be 	 	supermassive	black	 hole 	 s 	 	exist	at	the	center	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
but	it	's	a	kind	of	 in 	 direct 	 	argument	.
 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	it	's	 give 	 n 	 	rise	to	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	not	just	these	prima	donnas	that	have	these	supermassive	black	 hole 	 s 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	all	 galax 	 ies 	 	might	harbor	these	supermassive	black	 hole 	 s 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 center 	 s 	 	.
and	if	that	's	the	case	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	normal	 galax 	 y 	 	;	what	we	see	is	the	star	light	.
and	if	there	is	a	supermassive	black	hole	,	what	we	need	to	 assum 	 e 	 	is	that	it	's	a	black	hole	on	a	diet	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	the	way	to	suppress	the	 energ 	 etic 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	that	we	see	in	active	galactic	nuclei	.
if	we	're	going	to	look	for	these	 steal 	 th 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	at	the	center	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	the	best	place	to	look	is	in	our	own	 galax 	 y 	 	,	our	 milk 	 y 	 	way	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	wide	field	picture	taken	of	the	center	of	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	.
and	what	we	see	is	a	line	of	 star 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	live	in	a	 galax 	 y 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 flatten 	 ed 	 	,	 dis 	 k 	 	-	like	structure	.
and	we	live	in	the	middle	of	it	,	so	when	we	look	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	center	,	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	plane	which	 define 	 s 	 	the	plane	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	,	or	line	that	 define 	 s 	 	the	plane	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
now	,	the	advantage	of	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	our	own	 galax 	 y 	 	is	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	the	 close 	 st 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	center	of	a	 galax 	 y 	 	that	we	're	ever	going	to	have	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	next	 close 	 st 	 	 galax 	 y 	 	is	100	 time 	 s 	 	further	away	.
so	,	we	can	see	far	more	detail	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	than	anyplace	else	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	'll	see	in	a	moment	,	the	ability	to	see	detail	is	key	to	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	.
so	,	how	do	 astronomer 	 s 	 	prove	that	there	is	a	lot	of	mass	 in 	 side 	 	a	small	volume	?
which	is	the	job	that	i	have	to	show	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	the	tool	that	we	use	is	to	watch	the	way	 star 	 s 	 	orbit	the	black	hole	.
 star 	 s 	 	will	orbit	the	black	hole	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	way	that	 planet 	 s 	 	orbit	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
it	's	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	pull	that	 make 	 s 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	orbit	.
if	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	massive	 object 	 s 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	would	go	 fly 	 ing 	 	off	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	go	at	a	much	 s 	 lower 	 	rate	 be 	 cause 	 	all	that	 determine 	 s 	 	how	they	go	around	is	how	much	mass	is	 in 	 side 	 	 it 	 s 	 	orbit	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	,	 be 	 cause 	 	remember	my	job	is	to	show	there	is	a	lot	of	mass	 in 	 side 	 	a	small	volume	.
so	,	if	i	know	how	fast	it	 go 	 es 	 	around	,	i	know	the	mass	.
and	if	i	know	the	scale	of	the	orbit	i	know	the	 radi 	 us 	 	.
so	,	i	want	to	see	the	 star 	 s 	 	that	are	 a 	 s 	 	close	to	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	show	there	is	a	mass	 in 	 side 	 	 a 	 s 	 	small	a	region	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	want	to	see	a	lot	of	detail	.
and	that	's	the	reason	that	for	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	we	've	used	the	world	's	largest	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	keck	 observ 	 atory 	 	.	it	 host 	 s 	 	two	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	with	a	mirror	10	 meter 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	of	a	tennis	court	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	campaign	promise	of	large	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	is	that	is	that	the	 big 	 ger 	 	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	the	 small 	 er 	 	the	detail	that	we	can	see	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	these	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	or	any	 tele 	 scope 	 	on	the	ground	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	little	bit	of	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	living	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	campaign	promise	.
and	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	atmosphere	.
atmosphere	is	great	for	us	;	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	here	on	earth	.
but	it	's	 relat 	 ively 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	for	 astronomer 	 s 	 	who	want	to	look	through	the	atmosphere	to	astronomical	 source 	 s 	 	.
so	,	to	give	you	a	sense	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	looking	at	a	 pe 	 bble 	 	at	the	bottom	of	a	stream	.
looking	at	the	 pe 	 bble 	 	on	the	bottom	of	the	stream	,	the	stream	is	 continu 	 ously 	 	moving	and	 turbul 	 ent 	 	,	and	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	see	the	 pe 	 bble 	 	on	the	bottom	of	the	stream	.
 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	the	same	way	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	see	astronomical	 source 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	atmosphere	that	's	 continu 	 ously 	 	moving	by	.
so	,	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	ways	to	correct	for	the	atmosphere	,	to	give	us	a	 clean 	 er 	 	view	.
and	that	 buy 	 s 	 	us	about	a	factor	of	20	.
and	i	think	all	of	you	can	agree	that	if	you	can	figure	out	how	to	improve	life	by	a	factor	of	20	,	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	your	 life 	 style 	 	by	a	lot	,	say	your	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	,	you	'd	notice	,	or	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	you	'd	notice	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	here	 show 	 s 	 	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	we	use	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 adapt 	 ive 	 	 optic 	 s 	 	.
you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	an	 anim 	 ation 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	between	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	you	would	see	if	you	do	n't	use	 th 	 is 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	just	a	picture	that	 show 	 s 	 	the	 star 	 s 	 	--	and	the	box	is	 center 	 ed 	 	on	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	,	where	we	think	the	black	hole	is	.
so	,	 with 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	you	ca	n't	see	the	 star 	 s 	 	.
with	 th 	 is 	 	technology	all	of	a	sudden	you	can	see	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	technology	 work 	 s 	 	by	 introduc 	 ing 	 	a	mirror	 in 	 to 	 	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	 optic 	 s 	 	system	that	's	 continu 	 ously 	 	changing	to	 counter 	 act 	 	what	the	atmosphere	is	 do 	 ing 	 	to	you	.
so	,	it	's	kind	of	like	 ver 	 y 	 	 f 	 ancy 	 	 eye 	 glass 	 es 	 	for	your	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
now	,	in	the	next	few	 slide 	 s 	 	i	'm	just	going	to	focus	on	that	little	square	there	.
so	,	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	look	at	the	 star 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	that	small	square	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	all	of	them	.
so	,	i	want	to	see	how	these	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 move 	 d 	 	.
and	over	the	course	of	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	,	these	 star 	 s 	 	have	 move 	 d 	 	a	tremendous	amount	.
so	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	we	see	the	 star 	 s 	 	go	all	the	way	around	.
now	,	most	 astronomer 	 s 	 	have	a	 favor 	 ite 	 	star	,	and	mine	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	star	that	's	 label 	 ed 	 	up	there	,	so	-	2	.
 absolute 	 ly 	 	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	star	in	the	world	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	around	in	 on 	 ly 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	to	give	you	a	sense	of	how	short	that	is	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	 take 	 s 	 	200	million	 year 	 s 	 	to	go	around	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
 star 	 s 	 	that	we	 k 	 new 	 	about	before	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 s 	 	close	to	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	take	500	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	 go 	 es 	 	around	in	a	human	 life 	 time 	 	.
that	's	kind	of	 pro 	 found 	 	,	in	a	way	.
but	it	's	the	key	to	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	.	the	orbit	 tell 	 s 	 	me	how	much	mass	is	 in 	 side 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 radi 	 us 	 	.
so	,	next	we	see	a	picture	here	that	 show 	 s 	 	you	before	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	the	 s 	 ize 	 	to	which	we	could	 con 	 fine 	 	the	mass	of	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
what	we	 k 	 new 	 	before	is	that	there	was	four	million	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	 in 	 side 	 	that	circle	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	there	was	a	lot	of	other	stuff	 in 	 side 	 	that	circle	.
you	can	see	a	lot	of	 star 	 s 	 	.
so	,	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	to	the	idea	that	there	was	a	supermassive	black	hole	at	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	could	put	a	lot	of	stuff	in	there	.
but	with	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	,	we	've	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	that	same	mass	to	a	much	 small 	 er 	 	volume	that	's	10,000	 time 	 s 	 	 small 	 er 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	show	that	there	is	a	supermassive	black	hole	there	.
to	give	you	a	sense	of	how	small	that	 s 	 ize 	 	is	,	that	's	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	our	solar	system	.
so	,	we	're	 cram 	 ming 	 	four	million	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	small	volume	.
now	,	truth	in	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.	right	?
i	have	told	you	my	job	is	to	get	it	down	to	the	schwarzchild	 radi 	 us 	 	.
and	the	truth	is	,	i	'm	not	 quit 	 e 	 	there	.
but	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	no	 alter 	 native 	 	 to 	 day 	 	to	 explain 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 concent 	 ration 	 	of	mass	.
and	,	in	fact	,	it	's	the	best	evidence	we	have	to	date	for	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	a	supermassive	black	hole	at	the	center	of	our	own	 galax 	 y 	 	,	but	any	in	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	,	what	next	?	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	going	to	do	with	 to 	 day 	 	's	technology	,	so	let	's	move	on	with	the	problem	.
so	,	what	i	want	to	tell	you	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	is	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	 excit 	 ement 	 	of	what	we	can	do	 to 	 day 	 	at	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	,	now	that	we	know	that	there	is	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	,	that	there	is	a	supermassive	black	hole	there	.
and	the	 f 	 un 	 	phase	of	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	is	,	while	we	've	tested	some	of	our	 idea 	 s 	 	about	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	a	supermassive	black	hole	 be 	 ing 	 	at	the	center	of	our	 galax 	 y 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	every	single	one	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 in 	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	what	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	.
and	that	's	the	 f 	 un 	 	.
so	,	let	me	give	you	the	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
you	can	ask	,	``	what	do	you	expect	for	the	old	 star 	 s 	 	,	 star 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	around	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	for	a	long	time	,	they	've	had	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	time	to	interact	with	the	black	hole	.	``
what	you	expect	there	is	that	old	 star 	 s 	 	should	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 cluster 	 ed 	 	around	the	black	hole	.
you	should	see	a	lot	of	old	 star 	 s 	 	next	to	that	black	hole	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	for	the	young	 star 	 s 	 	,	or	in	contrast	,	the	young	 star 	 s 	 	,	they	just	should	not	be	there	.
a	black	hole	 do 	 es 	 	not	make	a	kind	neighbor	to	a	stellar	 nurse 	 ry 	 	.
to	get	a	star	to	form	,	you	need	a	big	ball	of	gas	and	dust	to	collapse	.
and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	fragile	 ent 	 ity 	 	.
and	what	 do 	 es 	 	the	big	black	hole	do	?
it	 strip 	 s 	 	that	gas	cloud	 a 	 part 	 	.
it	 pull 	 s 	 	much	 strong 	 er 	 	on	one	side	than	the	other	and	the	cloud	is	 strip 	 ped 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	 anticip 	 ated 	 	that	star	 form 	 ation 	 	should	n't	proceed	in	that	environment	.
so	,	you	should	n't	see	young	 star 	 s 	 	.
so	,	what	do	we	see	?
using	 observ 	 ations 	 	that	are	not	the	 one 	 s 	 	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	figure	out	which	 one 	 s 	 	are	old	and	which	 one 	 s 	 	are	young	.
the	old	 one 	 s 	 	are	red	.
the	young	 one 	 s 	 	are	blue	.	and	the	yellow	 one 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	know	yet	.
so	,	you	can	 al 	 ready 	 	see	the	surprise	.
there	is	a	 d 	 earth 	 	of	old	 star 	 s 	 	.
there	is	an	abundance	of	young	 star 	 s 	 	,	so	it	's	the	exact	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	the	 predict 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 f 	 un 	 	part	.
and	in	fact	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	,	 th 	 is 	 	 myster 	 y 	 	of	how	do	you	get	--	how	do	you	 re 	 solve 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 contradict 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	in	fact	,	my	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	are	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	moment	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	at	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	in	hawaii	,	making	 observ 	 ations 	 	to	get	us	 hope 	 fully 	 	to	the	next	stage	,	where	we	can	address	 th 	 is 	 	question	of	why	are	there	so	 man 	 y 	 	young	 star 	 s 	 	,	and	so	few	old	 star 	 s 	 	.
to	make	further	progress	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	look	at	the	 orbit 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	that	are	much	further	away	.
to	do	that	we	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	need	much	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	technology	than	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	truth	,	while	i	 s 	 aid 	 	we	're	 correct 	 ing 	 	for	the	earth	's	atmosphere	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	correct	for	half	the	 error 	 s 	 	that	are	 introduc 	 ed 	 	.
we	do	 th 	 is 	 	by	 shoot 	 ing 	 	a	laser	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	,	and	what	we	think	we	can	do	is	if	we	shine	a	few	more	that	we	can	correct	the	rest	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	hope	to	do	in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	on	a	much	 long 	 er 	 	time	scale	,	what	we	hope	to	do	is	build	even	 large 	 r 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	remember	,	 big 	 ger 	 	is	better	in	 astro 	 nomy 	 	.
so	,	we	want	to	build	a	30	meter	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
and	with	 th 	 is 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	we	should	be	able	to	see	 star 	 s 	 	that	are	even	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
and	we	hope	to	be	able	to	test	some	of	einstein	's	 the 	 ories 	 	of	general	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	some	 idea 	 s 	 	in	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	about	how	 galax 	 ies 	 	form	.
so	,	we	think	the	future	of	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	in	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	an	 anim 	 ation 	 	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	 show 	 s 	 	you	how	these	 orbit 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	moving	,	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
and	i	hope	,	if	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	,	i	've	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	you	that	,	one	,	we	do	in	fact	have	a	supermassive	black	hole	at	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	do	exist	in	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	we	have	to	 con 	 tend 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	have	to	explain	how	you	can	get	these	 object 	 s 	 	in	our	physical	world	.
second	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	look	at	that	 interact 	 ion 	 	of	how	supermassive	black	 hole 	 s 	 	interact	,	and	understand	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	the	role	in	which	they	play	in	 sha 	 ping 	 	what	 galax 	 ies 	 	are	,	and	how	they	work	.
and	last	but	not	 l 	 east 	 	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	would	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 ad 	 vent 	 	of	the	tremendous	progress	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	made	on	the	technology	front	.
and	we	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	field	that	is	moving	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	fast	,	and	 hold 	 s 	 	a	lot	in	store	for	the	future	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
