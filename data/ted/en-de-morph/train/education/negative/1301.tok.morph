my	 travel 	 s 	 	to	afghanistan	 beg 	 an 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	on	the	eastern	border	of	my	country	,	my	 home 	 land 	 	,	poland	.
i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	through	the	 forest 	 s 	 	of	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	's	 tale 	 s 	 	.
a	land	where	every	field	 hide 	 s 	 	a	grave	,	where	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 de 	 port 	 ed 	 	or	 kill 	 ed 	 	in	the	20th	century	.
 be 	 hind 	 	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	i	found	a	soul	of	 place 	 s 	 	.
i	met	humble	people	.
i	heard	 the 	 ir 	 	 pray 	 er 	 	and	ate	 the 	 ir 	 	bread	.
then	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	east	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	--	from	eastern	europe	to	central	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	--	through	the	caucasus	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	middle	east	,	north	africa	,	russia	.
and	i	ever	met	more	humble	people	.
and	i	 share 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bread	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 pray 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	i	went	to	afghanistan	.
one	day	,	i	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	bridge	over	the	oxus	river	.
i	was	 al 	 one 	 	on	foot	.
and	the	afghan	soldier	was	so	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	see	me	that	he	 for 	 got 	 	to	stamp	my	 pass 	 port 	 	.
but	he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	cup	of	tea	.
and	i	 under 	 stood 	 	that	his	surprise	was	my	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
so	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	and	 travel 	 ing 	 	,	by	 horse 	 s 	 	,	by	yak	,	by	truck	,	by	 hitch 	 hik 	 ing 	 	,	from	iran	's	border	to	the	bottom	,	to	the	edge	of	the	wakhan	corridor	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	i	could	find	 no 	 or 	 	,	the	 hid 	 den 	 	light	of	afghanistan	.
my	 on 	 ly 	 	weapon	was	my	 note 	 book 	 	and	my	leica	.
i	heard	 pray 	 ers 	 	of	the	sufi	--	humble	muslims	,	 hat 	 ed 	 	by	the	taliban	.
 hid 	 den 	 	river	,	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	with	the	 mystic 	 ism 	 	from	gibraltar	to	india	.
the	mosque	where	the	 respect 	 ful 	 	 foreign 	 er 	 	is	 shower 	 ed 	 	with	 bless 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	with	 tear 	 s 	 	,	and	 welcome 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	gift	.
what	do	we	know	about	the	country	and	the	people	that	we	pretend	to	protect	,	about	the	 village 	 s 	 	where	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	medicine	to	kill	the	pain	and	to	stop	the	 hung 	 er 	 	is	 op 	 ium 	 	?
these	are	 op 	 ium 	 	-	 addict 	 ed 	 	people	on	the	 roof 	 s 	 	of	kabul	10	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	our	war	.
these	are	the	nomad	 girl 	 s 	 	who	 be 	 came 	 	 prostitute 	 s 	 	for	afghan	 business 	 men 	 	.
what	do	we	know	about	the	women	10	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	war	?
clothed	in	 th 	 is 	 	nylon	bag	,	made	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	with	the	name	of	burqa	.
i	saw	one	day	,	the	largest	school	in	afghanistan	,	a	 girl 	 s 	 	'	school	.
13,000	 girl 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	here	in	the	rooms	 under 	 ground 	 	,	full	of	 s 	 corp 	 ions 	 	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	love	[	for	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	]	was	so	big	that	i	 cri 	 ed 	 	.
what	do	we	know	about	the	death	 threat 	 s 	 	by	the	taliban	 nail 	 ed 	 	on	the	 door 	 s 	 	of	the	people	who	 da 	 re 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 daughter 	 s 	 	to	school	 a 	 s 	 	in	balkh	?
the	region	is	not	secure	,	but	full	of	the	taliban	,	and	they	did	it	.
my	aim	is	to	give	a	voice	to	the	silent	people	,	to	show	the	 hid 	 den 	 	 light 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 cur 	 tain 	 	of	the	great	game	,	the	small	 world 	 s 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	by	the	media	and	the	 prophet 	 s 	 	of	a	global	conflict	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
