i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	wilsonart	 inter 	 national 	 	,	a	plastic	 lam 	 in 	 ate 	 	company	,	which	is	the	largest	plastic	 lam 	 in 	 ate 	 	company	in	the	world	--	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	design	a	trade	show	booth	for	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	at	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	furniture	fair	in	new	york	,	in	2000	.
so	looking	at	 the 	 ir 	 	three	main	 market 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	product	which	 we 	 re 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 transport 	 ation 	 	design	,	 in 	 terior 	 s 	 	and	furniture	,	we	came	up	with	the	solution	of	taking	an	old	airstream	 trail 	 er 	 	and	 gutt 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 port 	 ray 	 	 lam 	 in 	 ate 	 	,	and	a	 trail 	 er 	 	,	in	kind	of	a	fresh	,	new	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	look	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	 trail 	 er 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	up	at	my	shop	in	berkeley	,	i	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	never	 steppe 	 d 	 	foot	in	an	airstream	 trail 	 er 	 	,	or	any	other	 trail 	 er 	 	.
so	i	can	be	 some 	 body 	 	that	can	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	 total 	 ly 	 	fresh	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	and	see	if	i	can	optimize	it	in	 it 	 s 	 	most	 ideal 	 istic 	 	fashion	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	had	to	do	some	research	and	 re 	 ally 	 	figure	out	what	had	gone	wrong	 some 	 where 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	airstream	.
what	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	these	 in 	 terior 	 s 	 	is	that	there	was	a	 dis 	 connect 	 	between	the	 ex 	 terior 	 	shell	and	the	 in 	 terior 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	the	 piece 	 s 	 	.
in	that	the	shell	was	 original 	 ly 	 	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 light 	 weight 	 	,	modern	,	 futurist 	 ic 	 	,	high	-	tech	pod	for	 hurt 	 ling 	 	down	the	 free 	 way 	 	,	and	the	 in 	 terior 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	out	of	sync	with	that	.
in	fact	it	 appear 	 ed 	 	like	they	 re 	 ference 	 d 	 	a	mountain	 cab 	 in 	 	.
that	 seem 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	like	a	crisis	to	me	,	that	they	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	develop	a	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	about	 es 	 cape 	 	,	and	about	travel	,	and	 modern 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 trail 	 er 	 	that	was	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	the	shell	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	some	 archeo 	 logy 	 	in	the	 trail 	 er 	 	 it 	 self 	 	to	figure	out	what	's	authentic	in	an	airstream	 trail 	 er 	 	,	and	what	 feel 	 s 	 	like	it	 ha 	 s 	 	true	purpose	and	 util 	 ity 	 	.
we	 strip 	 ped 	 	out	all	the	vinyl	and	 zo 	 lat 	 one 	 	paint	that	was	 cover 	 ing 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	just	fantastic	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	shell	.
we	took	off	all	the	visible	 hard 	 ware 	 	and	trim	that	was	kind	of	 do 	 ing 	 	the	country	 cab 	 in 	 	thing	.
i	 liter 	 ally 	 	drew	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	of	the	 trail 	 er 	 	,	 mock 	 ed 	 	it	up	in	 card 	 board 	 	,	we	'd	come	in	and	cut	,	decide	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	wrong	,	pull	it	out	,	put	it	back	in	.
the	main	goal	was	to	smooth	out	the	 in 	 terior 	 	,	and	begin	to	speak	about	motion	,	and	 mobil 	 ity 	 	,	and	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	 difficult 	 y 	 	on	one	of	these	 trail 	 ers 	 	is	that	when	you	're	 design 	 ing 	 	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	no	logical	place	to	stop	and	start	 material 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 continu 	 ous 	 	form	of	the	 trail 	 er 	 	.
there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	two	 wall 	 s 	 	and	a	 ceil 	 ing 	 	coming	together	,	where	you	can	change	 material 	 s 	 	and	 shape 	 s 	 	.
so	that	 be 	 came 	 	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
 com 	 pound 	 ing 	 	that	,	the	material	of	choice	,	 lam 	 in 	 ate 	 	,	that	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 high 	 light 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 bend 	 s 	 	in	two	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 com 	 pound 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	 in 	 terior 	 	.
what	i	had	to	 dev 	 ise 	 	was	a	way	of	 fool 	 ing 	 	the	eye	 in 	 to 	 	 believ 	 ing 	 	that	all	these	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	are	 curv 	 ed 	 	with	the	shell	.
what	i	came	up	with	was	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	second	 skin 	 s 	 	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	float	over	the	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	shell	.
and	what	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	there	was	direct	your	eye	in	the	space	,	so	that	you	would	perceive	the	 geo 	 metry 	 	in	a	different	way	,	and	that	the	 case 	 work 	 	would	n't	break	up	the	space	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	way	to	run	power	and	 re 	 wire 	 	the	 trail 	 er 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 tear 	 ing 	 	out	the	skin	,	so	they	function	 a 	 s 	 	an	 electric 	 al 	 	chase	.
that	's	the	 trail 	 er 	 	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
that	 trail 	 er 	 	led	to	 an 	 other 	 	commission	,	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 what 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	tokyo	 design 	 ers 	 	block	.
 it 	 s 	 	a	week	of	furniture	design	 event 	 s 	 	in	tokyo	,	in	october	.
teruo	kurosaki	,	who	 own 	 s 	 	a	furniture	company	 call 	 ed 	 	idee	,	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	ship	him	two	 trail 	 ers 	 	to	tokyo	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	one	he	would	like	to	make	a	real	 trail 	 er 	 	,	 function 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	would	sell	that	one	.
 trail 	 er 	 	number	two	,	you	have	a	blank	 s 	 late 	 	,	you	can	to	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	.
we	came	up	with	a	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	scenario	of	a	dj	 travel 	 ing 	 	around	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	that	would	collect	 record 	 s 	 	and	go	on	 tour 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 trail 	 er 	 	 house 	 d 	 	two	 turn 	 table 	 s 	 	,	 mix 	 er 	 	,	wet	bar	,	 f 	 ridge 	 	,	 integrate 	 d 	 	sound	system	.
it	's	got	a	huge	couch	,	 fit 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	people	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	we	'd	had	a	great	time	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	in	 th 	 is 	 	 trail 	 er 	 	i	took	it	 up 	 on 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	think	about	travel	,	and	 es 	 cape 	 	,	in	an	 idio 	 syn 	 cratic 	 	sense	.
a	lot	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	 migr 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	production	 trail 	 ers 	 	for	airstream	.
 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	up	to	the	time	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 consult 	 ing 	 	to	airstream	.
they	came	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	can	we	do	to	 fresh 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	up	?
and	do	you	think	 kid 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 skateboard 	 ers 	 	,	 surf 	 ers 	 	,	rock	 climb 	 ers 	 	,	would	use	these	 thing 	 s 	 	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	not	in	that	 in 	 terior 	 	.	``
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	went	out	to	airstream	about	six	 time 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	process	of	building	 th 	 is 	 	prototype	,	and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	bambi	prototype	.
i	thought	,	``	 final 	 ly 	 	,	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	great	,	big	company	,	i	'm	gon	na	work	with	 some 	 body 	 	with	money	for	 tool 	 ing 	 	and	 mold 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	prototype	 facil 	 ity 	 	,	and	it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	my	shop	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	--	same	 tool 	 s 	 	,	same	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	the	problem	 be 	 came 	 	--	and	they	set	 th 	 is 	 	dilemma	to	me	--	that	you	have	to	design	the	 in 	 terior 	 	using	 on 	 ly 	 	our	 exist 	 ing 	 	technology	,	and	there	's	no	money	for	 tool 	 ing 	 	or	 mold 	 ing 	 	.
the	 trail 	 ers 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	hand	-	built	.
all	the	 case 	 work 	 	is	hand	-	scribed	in	,	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	,	so	you	ca	n't	just	cut	100	 part 	 s 	 	for	100	 trail 	 ers 	 	,	you	have	to	cut	them	big	,	and	every	single	one	is	hand	-	fit	.
they	did	n't	want	to	go	to	a	 component 	 ized 	 	system	.
and	there	it	is	,	that	's	the	bambi	16	.
