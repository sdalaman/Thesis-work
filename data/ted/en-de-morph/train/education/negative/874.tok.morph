tom	green	:	that	's	a	4chan	thing	.
these	 kid 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	they	have	 th 	 is 	 	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	and	they	like	to	say	funny	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	barrel	roll	.	``
it	's	a	video	game	move	from	``	star	fox	.	``
``	star	fox	20	``	?
tom	green	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 dog 	 ging 	 	me	for	a	year	.
i	got	to	tell	you	,	it	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	me	nuts	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	wake	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night	and	i	 s 	 cream 	 	,	``	4chan	!	``
christopher	poole	:	when	i	was	15	,	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	futaba	channel	.
and	it	was	a	japanese	forum	and	 image 	 board 	 	.
that	format	of	forum	,	at	that	time	,	was	not	well	-	known	 out 	 side 	 	of	japan	.
and	so	what	i	did	is	i	took	it	,	i	 transl 	 ated 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	english	,	and	i	 s 	 tuck 	 	it	up	for	my	 friend 	 s 	 	to	use	.
now	,	six	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	over	seven	million	people	are	using	it	,	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	over	700,000	 post 	 s 	 	per	day	.
and	we	've	gone	from	one	board	to	48	 board 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
so	,	what	's	 un 	 ique 	 	about	the	 s 	 ite 	 	is	that	it	's	 anonym 	 ous 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 memor 	 y 	 	.
there	's	no	 archiv 	 e 	 	,	there	are	no	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	,	there	's	no	 registr 	 ation 	 	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	used	to	with	 forum 	 s 	 	do	n't	exist	on	4chan	.
and	that	's	led	to	 th 	 is 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	that	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	raw	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 filter 	 ed 	 	.
what	the	 s 	 ite 	 	's	known	for	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	environment	,	is	it	's	 foster 	 ed 	 	the	creation	of	a	lot	of	 inter 	 net 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	,	viral	 video 	 s 	 	and	 what 	 not 	 	,	known	 a 	 s 	 	``	 meme 	 s 	 	.	``
two	of	the	largest	 meme 	 s 	 	that	have	come	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	some	of	you	might	be	familiar	with	are	these	lolcats	--	just	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 cat 	 s 	 	with	text	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 reson 	 ates 	 	with	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	,	and	there	is	a	whole	 b 	 logging 	 	empire	now	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	 picture 	 s 	 	like	these	.
and	rick	astley	's	kind	of	 re 	 birth 	 	these	past	two	 year 	 s 	 	...
rickroll	was	 th 	 is 	 	bait	and	 s 	 witch 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	,	classic	bait	and	 s 	 witch 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	they	're	 link 	 ing 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	get	an	'80s	pop	song	.	that	's	all	it	was	.
and	it	got	big	 en 	 ough 	 	to	the	point	where	there	was	a	float	last	year	at	the	macy	's	 thank 	 s 	 giving 	 	day	 para 	 de 	 	,	and	rick	astley	 pop 	 s 	 	out	,	and	 rick 	 roll 	 s 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 meme 	 s 	 	that	come	out	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
there	are	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	that	have	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 main 	 stream 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	i	've	just	 show 	 n 	 	you	,	but	every	day	,	every	month	,	people	are	producing	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	.
so	 do 	 es 	 	a	 s 	 ite 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	have	 rule 	 s 	 	?
we	do	;	they	're	the	 cod 	 ified 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	that	i	've	come	up	with	,	which	are	more	-	or	-	less	 ignor 	 ed 	 	by	the	community	.
and	so	they	've	come	up	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	,	the	``	 rule 	 s 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.	``
and	so	there	are	three	that	i	want	to	show	you	 specific 	 ally 	 	.
rule	one	is	you	do	n't	talk	about	/b/	.
two	is	you	do	not	talk	about	/b/	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	:	``	if	it	 exist 	 s 	 	,	there	is	porn	of	it	.	no	 exception 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	will	spare	you	that	slide	.
i	assure	you	,	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	true	.
/	b	/	is	the	first	board	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	,	and	it	is	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	the	 beat 	 ing 	 	heart	of	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
it	is	where	a	third	of	all	the	traffic	is	going	.
and	/	b	/	is	known	for	,	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	,	not	just	the	 meme 	 s 	 	they	've	 create 	 d 	 	,	but	the	 exploit 	 s 	 	.
and	chris	just	 touch 	 ed 	 	on	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	a	second	ago	,	and	that	was	the	time	100	poll	.
so	 some 	 body 	 	at	time	,	at	the	magazine	,	thought	it	would	be	 f 	 un 	 	to	nominate	me	for	 th 	 is 	 	thing	they	did	last	year	.
and	so	they	 place 	 d 	 	me	on	it	,	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	got	wind	of	it	.	my	community	 decide 	 d 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	win	it	.
i	did	n't	instruct	them	to	do	it	;	they	just	 decide 	 d 	 	that	that	's	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	,	you	know	,	390	percent	approval	rating	ai	n't	so	bad	.
so	they	broke	that	poll	.
and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	on	top	.
i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	at	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 ancy 	 	party	.
but	that	's	not	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 put 	 ting 	 	me	at	the	top	of	 th 	 is 	 	list	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	it	got	so	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	to	the	point	where	they	 gam 	 ed 	 	all	of	the	top	21	 place 	 s 	 	to	spell	``	marblecake	.	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	game	.	``
the	amount	of	time	and	effort	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	that	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
and	``	 mar 	 ble 	 	cake	``	is	significant	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	the	channel	that	 th 	 is 	 	group	 call 	 ed 	 	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	.
 anonym 	 ous 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	group	of	people	that	 protest 	 ed 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 famous 	 ly 	 	,	scientology	.
the	story	is	,	scientology	had	 th 	 is 	 	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	video	of	tom	 cruis 	 e 	 	.	it	went	up	 on 	 line 	 	.
they	got	it	taken	 off 	 line 	 	and	 manage 	 d 	 	to	piss	off	part	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	so	these	people	,	over	7,000	people	,	less	than	one	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 organize 	 d 	 	in	a	hundred	cities	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	and	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	l.a.	--	 protest 	 ed 	 	the	church	of	scientology	,	and	they	have	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	do	so	,	now	,	two	full	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	fact	.
they	are	still	 protest 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	activist	group	that	's	 th 	 is 	 	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	group	that	's	come	out	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	last	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	story	of	 dust 	 y 	 	the	cat	.
 dust 	 y 	 	is	the	name	that	we	've	 give 	 n 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	cat	.
 th 	 is 	 	young	man	 post 	 ed 	 	a	video	of	him	 ab 	 using 	 	his	cat	on	youtube	.
and	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	did	n't	 s 	 it 	 	well	with	people	,	and	so	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 out 	 pour 	 ing 	 	of	support	for	people	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	what	they	did	is	they	--	i	mean	,	they	put	csi	to	shame	here	--	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 detect 	 ive 	 s 	 	came	out	.
they	 match 	 ed 	 	,	they	found	his	myspace	.
they	took	the	youtube	video	and	they	 mash 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	video	.
 with 	 in 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	they	had	his	name	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	48	 hour 	 s 	 	,	he	was	 arrest 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	,	what	i	think	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	about	a	community	like	4chan	is	just	that	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	open	place	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	raw	,	it	's	 un 	 filter 	 ed 	 	.
and	 s 	 ites 	 	like	it	are	kind	of	going	the	way	of	the	dinosaur	right	now	.
they	're	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	social	 network 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 persist 	 ent 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
we	're	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	a	lack	of	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
we	're	 sacri 	 f 	 ic 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	that	,	and	i	think	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	.
thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	thank	you	.
got	a	couple	 question 	 s 	 	for	you	.
but	if	i	ask	them	,	is	the	ted	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	going	to	go	down	?
cp	:	you	're	 luck 	 y 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 stream 	 ed 	 	to	them	live	right	now	.
ca	:	well	,	you	never	know	.	some	of	them	--	we	've	got	people	in	75	 count 	 ries 	 	out	there	 watch 	 ing 	 	.
do	n't	tell	.
but	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	issue	on	 anonym 	 ity 	 	is	--	i	mean	,	you	made	the	case	there	.
but	 anonym 	 ity 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	people	to	say	 any 	 thing 	 	,	all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	gone	.
you	've	had	to	 wrestl 	 e 	 	with	 issue 	 s 	 	like	child	 porn 	 ography 	 	.
and	i	'm	just	 cur 	 ious 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	you	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	lie	awake	in	the	night	 worry 	 ing 	 	that	you	've	 open 	 ed 	 	pandora	's	box	.
cp	:	 y 	 es 	 	and	no	.
i	mean	,	for	 a 	 s 	 	much	good	that	kind	of	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	environment	,	there	is	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	bad	.
there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 down 	 side 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	that	the	 great 	 er 	 	good	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	here	by	just	 allow 	 ing 	 	people	--	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 place 	 s 	 	,	now	,	where	you	can	go	and	not	have	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 anonym 	 ous 	 	and	say	 what 	 ever 	 	you	'd	like	.
and	 say 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	you	like	,	i	think	,	is	 power 	 ful 	 	.
 do 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	you	like	is	now	 cross 	 ing 	 	a	line	.
but	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	have	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
when	i	get	 email 	 s 	 	,	people	say	,	``	thank	you	for	giving	me	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	 th 	 is 	 	 out 	 let 	 	,	where	i	can	come	after	work	and	be	 my 	 self 	 	.	``
ca	:	but	 word 	 s 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	can	be	 construct 	 ive 	 	;	it	can	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 dam 	 aging 	 	.
and	if	you	cut	the	link	between	what	is	 s 	 aid 	 	and	any	 attribut 	 ion 	 	back	to	you	,	i	mean	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	there	are	huge	 risk 	 s 	 	with	that	.
cp	:	there	are	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	.
but	--	ca	:	tell	me	about	what	--	i	mean	,	i	think	you	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	board	what	you	might	say	at	ted	,	right	?
cp	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	 post 	 ed 	 	a	 th 	 read 	 	on	sunday	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	it	had	over	12,000	 respons 	 es 	 	.
and	the	thing	is	,	i	did	n't	make	it	 in 	 to 	 	that	 present 	 ation 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	ca	n't	read	to	you	 any 	 thing 	 	that	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	more	or	less	.

you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	surprising	semi	-	 under 	 ground 	 	influence	,	but	it	's	not	making	you	a	lot	of	money	,	yet	.
what	's	the	commercial	picture	here	?
cp	:	the	commercial	picture	is	that	there	 re 	 ally 	 	is	n't	much	of	one	,	i	guess	.
the	 s 	 ite 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	adult	content	on	it	.
i	mean	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	got	some	 ver 	 y 	 	offensive	,	 ob 	 scene 	 	content	on	it	,	just	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	language	 al 	 one 	 	.
