i	want	to	talk	about	 penguin 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	first	,	i	want	to	start	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	need	a	new	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	,	for	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	and	for	the	earth	.
when	i	came	to	the	galapagos	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	3,000	people	that	lived	in	the	galapagos	.
now	there	are	over	30,000	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 jeep 	 s 	 	on	santa	cruz	.
now	,	there	are	around	a	thousand	 truck 	 s 	 	and	 bus 	 es 	 	and	 car 	 s 	 	there	.
so	the	fundamental	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	face	are	 over 	 consumption 	 	and	too	 man 	 y 	 	people	.
it	's	the	same	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	galapagos	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 wo 	 rse 	 	here	,	in	some	ways	,	than	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 double 	 d 	 	the	population	of	the	earth	since	the	1960s	--	a	little	more	than	 double 	 d 	 	--	but	we	have	6.7	billion	people	in	the	world	,	and	we	all	like	to	 consum 	 e 	 	.
and	one	of	the	major	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	is	our	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	is	not	giving	us	the	proper	 feed 	 back 	 	.
we	're	not	 pay 	 ing 	 	the	true	 environment 	 al 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	of	our	 action 	 s 	 	.
and	when	i	came	at	age	22	to	live	on	fernandina	,	let	me	just	say	,	that	i	had	never	 camp 	 ed 	 	before	.
i	had	never	lived	 al 	 one 	 	for	any	period	of	time	,	and	i	'd	never	slept	with	sea	 lion 	 s 	 	 s 	 nor 	 ing 	 	next	to	me	all	night	.
but	 more 	 over 	 	,	i	'd	never	lived	on	an	 un 	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	 is 	 land 	 	.
punta	espinosa	is	where	i	lived	for	over	a	year	,	and	we	call	it	 un 	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	no	people	there	.
but	it	's	 al 	 ive 	 	with	life	;	it	's	 hard 	 ly 	 	 un 	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	.
so	a	lot	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	when	i	came	to	the	galapagos	is	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	wild	 place 	 s 	 	,	wild	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	 wild 	 life 	 	,	and	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	that	 penguin 	 s 	 	have	.
 penguin 	 s 	 	are	real	 athlete 	 s 	 	:	they	can	swim	173	 kilometer 	 s 	 	in	a	day	.
they	can	swim	at	the	same	speed	day	and	night	--	that	's	 fast 	 er 	 	than	any	olympic	 swimm 	 er 	 	.
i	mean	,	they	can	do	like	seven	 kilometer 	 s 	 	an	hour	and	sustain	it	.
but	what	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 deep 	 ness 	 	here	,	emperor	 penguin 	 s 	 	can	go	down	more	than	500	 meter 	 s 	 	and	they	can	hold	 the 	 ir 	 	breath	for	23	 minute 	 s 	 	.
magellanic	 penguin 	 s 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	i	work	on	,	they	can	 d 	 ive 	 	to	about	90	 meter 	 s 	 	and	they	can	stay	down	for	about	4.6	 minute 	 s 	 	.
 human 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 fin 	 s 	 	:	90	 meter 	 s 	 	,	3.5	 minute 	 s 	 	.
and	i	doubt	 any 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	could	 re 	 ally 	 	hold	 the 	 ir 	 	breath	for	3.5	 minute 	 s 	 	.
you	have	to	train	to	be	able	to	do	that	.
so	 penguin 	 s 	 	are	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 athlete 	 s 	 	.
the	other	thing	is	,	i	've	never	met	 any 	 body 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	say	that	they	like	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 com 	 ical 	 	,	they	walk	 up 	 right 	 	,	and	,	of	course	,	they	're	diligent	.
and	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	well	-	 dress 	 ed 	 	.
so	they	have	all	the	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	that	people	 normal 	 ly 	 	like	.
but	 scientific 	 ally 	 	,	they	're	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 senti 	 nel 	 s 	 	.
they	tell	us	about	our	world	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	ocean	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	a	galapagos	penguin	that	's	on	the	front	of	a	little	zodiac	here	in	the	galapagos	.
and	that	's	what	i	came	to	 stud 	 y 	 	.
i	thought	i	was	going	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	social	behavior	of	galapagos	 penguin 	 s 	 	,	but	you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	 penguin 	 s 	 	are	rare	.
these	are	the	 ra 	 rest 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
why	i	thought	i	was	going	to	be	able	to	do	that	,	i	do	n't	know	.
but	the	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	since	i	was	first	here	.
when	i	 count 	 ed 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	for	the	first	time	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	census	,	we	just	 count 	 ed 	 	all	the	individual	 beak 	 s 	 	that	we	could	around	all	these	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
we	 count 	 ed 	 	around	2,000	,	so	i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	there	 re 	 ally 	 	are	,	but	i	know	i	can	count	2,000	.
if	you	go	and	do	it	now	,	the	national	 park 	 s 	 	count	about	500	.
so	we	have	a	quarter	of	the	 penguin 	 s 	 	that	we	did	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	of	most	of	our	living	 system 	 s 	 	.
we	have	less	than	we	had	before	,	and	most	of	them	are	in	 fair 	 ly 	 	steep	decline	.
and	i	want	to	just	show	you	a	little	bit	about	why	.
that	's	a	penguin	 bra 	 y 	 ing 	 	to	tell	you	that	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	pay	attention	to	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
most	 import 	 ant 	 	of	all	,	i	did	n't	know	what	that	was	the	first	time	i	heard	it	.
and	you	can	imagine	 sleep 	 ing 	 	on	fernandina	your	first	night	there	and	you	hear	 th 	 is 	 	 lone 	 some 	 	,	 plain 	 t 	 ful 	 	call	.
i	fell	in	love	with	 penguin 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 certain 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	rest	of	my	life	.
what	i	found	out	i	was	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	how	the	galapagos	 change 	 s 	 	,	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 vari 	 ation 	 	.
you	've	heard	about	these	el	ninos	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	that	 penguin 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	have	to	adapt	to	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cold	-	water	event	 call 	 ed 	 	la	nina	.
where	it	's	blue	and	it	's	green	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	the	water	is	 re 	 ally 	 	cold	.
and	so	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	current	coming	up	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	humboldt	current	--	that	 come 	 s 	 	all	the	way	out	to	the	galapagos	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	deep	 under 	 sea 	 	current	,	the	cromwell	current	,	that	 up 	 well 	 s 	 	around	the	galapagos	.
that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	all	the	 nutrient 	 s 	 	:	when	 th 	 is 	 	is	cold	in	the	galapagos	,	it	's	rich	,	and	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	food	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
when	we	have	 extrem 	 e 	 	el	nino	 event 	 s 	 	,	you	see	all	 th 	 is 	 	red	,	and	you	see	no	green	out	here	around	the	galapagos	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	there	's	no	 up 	 well 	 ing 	 	,	and	there	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	no	food	.
so	it	's	a	real	desert	for	not	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	 penguin 	 s 	 	and	the	sea	 lion 	 s 	 	and	the	marine	 iguan 	 a 	 s 	 	...
 thing 	 s 	 	die	when	there	's	no	food	.
but	we	did	n't	even	know	that	that	 affect 	 ed 	 	the	galapagos	when	i	went	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	imagine	 be 	 ing 	 	on	an	 is 	 land 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	you	're	going	to	see	 penguin 	 s 	 	,	and	you	're	in	the	middle	of	an	el	nino	event	and	there	are	no	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	 breed 	 ing 	 	;	they	're	not	even	around	.
i	 stud 	 ied 	 	marine	 iguan 	 a 	 s 	 	at	that	point	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	global	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	we	know	that	.
and	if	you	look	 a 	 long 	 	the	coast	of	argentina	,	where	i	work	now	,	at	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	punta	tombo	--	the	largest	magellanic	penguin	 colon 	 y 	 	in	the	world	down	here	about	44	 degree 	 s 	 	south	latitude	--	you	see	that	there	's	great	 vari 	 ation 	 	here	.
some	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	cold	water	 go 	 es 	 	all	the	way	up	to	brazil	,	and	other	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	these	la	nina	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
so	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	act	together	;	they	act	 different 	 ly 	 	,	but	that	is	the	kind	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	that	 penguin 	 s 	 	have	to	live	with	,	and	it	's	not	easy	.
so	when	i	went	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	magellanic	 penguin 	 s 	 	,	i	did	n't	have	any	 problem 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	at	punta	tombo	in	february	 show 	 ing 	 	all	the	 penguin 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	beach	.
i	went	there	 be 	 cause 	 	the	japanese	 want 	 ed 	 	to	start	 harvest 	 ing 	 	them	and	 turn 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	high	fashion	golf	 glove 	 s 	 	,	protein	and	oil	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 harvest 	 ed 	 	any	 penguin 	 s 	 	and	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	over	100,000	 tourist 	 s 	 	a	year	to	see	them	.
but	the	population	is	 dec 	 lining 	 	and	it	's	 decline 	 d 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	,	about	21	percent	since	1987	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	these	 survey 	 s 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	number	of	active	 nest 	 s 	 	.
here	,	you	can	see	where	punta	tombo	is	,	and	they	breed	in	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	dense	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
we	know	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	long	-	term	science	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	long	-	term	 stud 	 ies 	 	there	.
and	science	is	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 inform 	 ing 	 	decision	makers	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	in	changing	how	we	do	and	 know 	 ing 	 	the	direction	of	change	that	we	're	going	in	.
and	so	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	penguin	project	.	the	 wild 	 life 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	funded	me	 a 	 long 	 	with	a	lot	of	 individual 	 s 	 	over	the	last	27	 year 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	produce	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 map 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	we	know	that	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	galapagos	 penguin 	 s 	 	that	are	in	trouble	,	but	magellanics	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	species	of	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	have	 start 	 ed 	 	a	global	penguin	 socie 	 ty 	 	to	try	to	focus	on	the	real	 p 	 light 	 	of	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 p 	 light 	 s 	 	of	 penguin 	 s 	 	:	oil	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
 penguin 	 s 	 	do	n't	like	oil	and	they	do	n't	like	to	swim	through	oil	.
the	nice	thing	is	,	if	you	look	down	here	in	argentina	,	there	's	no	surface	oil	 poll 	 ution 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	composite	map	.
but	,	in	fact	,	when	we	went	to	argentina	,	 penguin 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	often	found	 total 	 ly 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	oil	.
so	they	 we 	 re 	 	just	 mind 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	business	.
they	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 swimm 	 ing 	 	through	 ball 	 ast 	 	water	that	had	oil	in	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	 tank 	 ers 	 	carry	oil	they	have	to	have	 ball 	 ast 	 	at	some	point	,	so	when	they	're	empty	,	they	have	the	 ball 	 ast 	 	water	in	there	.
when	they	come	back	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	dump	 th 	 is 	 	 oil 	 y 	 	 ball 	 ast 	 	water	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	.
why	do	they	do	that	?	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 cheap 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	pay	the	real	 environment 	 al 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.
we	 usual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	,	and	we	want	to	start	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 account 	 ing 	 	system	right	so	we	can	pay	the	real	cost	.
at	first	,	the	argentine	government	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	there	's	no	way	.
you	ca	n't	find	 oil 	 ed 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	in	argentina	.
we	have	 law 	 s 	 	,	and	we	ca	n't	have	 il 	 legal 	 	 dump 	 ing 	 	;	it	's	against	the	law	.	``
so	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	nine	 year 	 s 	 	convincing	the	government	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 oil 	 ed 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
in	some	 year 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	we	found	more	than	80	percent	of	the	adult	 penguin 	 s 	 	dead	on	the	beach	 we 	 re 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	oil	.
these	little	blue	 dot 	 s 	 	are	the	 fledg 	 ling 	 s 	 	--	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	survey	every	march	--	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	environment	from	january	 un 	 til 	 	march	,	so	 may 	 be 	 	three	 month 	 s 	 	at	the	most	that	they	could	get	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	oil	.
and	you	can	see	,	in	some	 year 	 s 	 	over	60	percent	of	the	 fledg 	 ling 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 oil 	 ed 	 	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	the	government	 listen 	 ed 	 	and	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	they	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 law 	 s 	 	.
they	 move 	 d 	 	the	 tank 	 er 	 	 lane 	 s 	 	40	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 far 	 ther 	 	off	shore	,	and	people	are	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 il 	 legal 	 	 dump 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	now	is	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 penguin 	 s 	 	are	 oil 	 ed 	 	.
why	are	there	even	these	 penguin 	 s 	 	 oil 	 ed 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 solve 	 d 	 	the	problem	in	chubut	 pro 	 vince 	 	,	which	is	like	a	state	in	argentina	where	punta	tombo	is	--	so	that	's	about	1,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	of	 coast 	 line 	 	--	but	we	have	n't	 solve 	 d 	 	the	problem	in	 north 	 ern 	 	argentina	,	uruguay	and	brazil	.
so	now	i	want	to	show	you	that	 penguin 	 s 	 	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
i	'm	just	going	to	talk	about	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	climate	change	.	now	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 f 	 un 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	put	satellite	 tag 	 s 	 	on	the	back	of	these	magellanic	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
try	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 donor 	 s 	 	to	give	you	a	couple	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	glue	a	satellite	tag	on	the	back	of	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
but	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	now	for	more	than	a	decade	to	learn	where	they	go	.
we	thought	we	 need 	 ed 	 	a	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	of	about	30	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	put	a	satellite	tag	on	the	back	of	a	penguin	.
and	what	the	 penguin 	 s 	 	show	us	--	and	these	are	all	the	little	 dot 	 s 	 	from	where	the	 penguin 	 s 	 	'	 position 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	for	 penguin 	 s 	 	in	 incub 	 ation 	 	in	2003	--	and	what	you	see	is	some	of	these	 individual 	 s 	 	are	going	800	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 nest 	 s 	 	.
so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mate	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	nest	 incub 	 ating 	 	the	 egg 	 s 	 	,	the	other	one	is	out	there	 for 	 aging 	 	,	and	the	 long 	 er 	 	they	have	to	stay	gone	,	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	condition	the	mate	is	in	when	the	mate	 come 	 s 	 	back	.
and	,	of	course	,	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	then	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	 vic 	 ious 	 	cycle	and	you	ca	n't	raise	a	lot	of	 chick 	 s 	 	.
here	you	see	in	2003	--	these	are	all	the	 dot 	 s 	 	of	where	the	 penguin 	 s 	 	are	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	raising	a	little	over	a	half	of	a	chick	.
here	,	you	can	see	in	2006	,	they	raised	 al 	 most 	 	three	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	a	chick	per	nest	,	and	you	can	see	that	they	're	 close 	 r 	 	to	punta	tombo	;	they	're	not	going	 a 	 s 	 	far	away	.
 th 	 is 	 	past	year	,	in	2009	,	you	can	see	that	they	're	now	raising	about	a	fourth	of	a	chick	,	and	some	of	these	 individual 	 s 	 	are	going	more	than	900	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 nest 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	kind	of	like	you	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	job	in	chicago	,	and	then	you	get	 transfer 	 red 	 	to	st.	louis	,	and	your	mate	is	not	happy	about	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	got	to	pay	 air 	 fare 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	gone	 long 	 er 	 	.
the	same	thing	's	true	for	 penguin 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	they	're	going	about	,	on	average	now	,	40	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 far 	 ther 	 	than	they	did	a	decade	ago	.
we	need	to	be	able	to	get	information	out	to	the	general	public	.
and	so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 public 	 ation 	 	with	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	for	 conserv 	 ation 	 	that	we	think	 present 	 s 	 	cutting	-	edge	science	in	a	new	,	novel	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 report 	 ers 	 	that	are	good	 writer 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	distill	the	information	and	make	it	 access 	 ible 	 	to	the	general	public	.
so	if	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	cutting	-	edge	science	and	 smart 	 er 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	,	you	should	join	with	our	11	 partner 	 s 	 	--	some	of	them	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	like	the	nature	 conserv 	 ancy 	 	--	and	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	magazine	 be 	 cause 	 	we	need	to	get	information	out	about	 conserv 	 ation 	 	to	the	general	public	.
 last 	 ly 	 	i	want	to	say	that	all	of	you	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	have	had	some	relationship	at	some	time	in	your	life	with	a	dog	,	a	cat	,	some	sort	of	pet	,	and	you	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 individual 	 s 	 	.
and	some	of	you	consider	them	 al 	 most 	 	part	of	your	family	.
if	you	had	a	relationship	with	a	penguin	,	you	'd	see	it	in	the	same	sort	of	way	.
they	're	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	change	how	you	view	the	world	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	not	that	different	from	us	:	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	living	,	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	raise	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	on	and	 surviv 	 e 	 	in	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	turbo	the	penguin	.
turbo	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	fed	.
he	met	us	and	got	his	name	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 start 	 ed 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	under	my	 dies 	 el 	 	truck	:	a	turbo	truck	,	so	we	named	him	turbo	.
turbo	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	to	 knock 	 ing 	 	on	the	door	with	his	beak	,	we	let	him	in	and	he	 come 	 s 	 	in	here	.
and	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	one	day	when	turbo	 br 	 ought 	 	in	a	friend	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	turbo	.
he	's	coming	up	to	one	of	my	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	and	 flip 	 per 	 	 pat 	 ting 	 	,	which	he	would	do	to	a	female	penguin	.
and	you	can	see	,	he	's	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	bite	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	in	before	and	he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	,	``	what	is	going	on	?
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 do 	 ing 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	weird	.	``
and	you	'll	see	soon	that	my	graduate	student	...
and	you	see	,	turbo	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	intent	on	his	 flip 	 per 	 	 pat 	 ting 	 	.
and	now	he	's	looking	at	the	other	guy	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	you	are	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	.	``
and	now	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	:	not	friendly	.
so	 penguin 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	differ	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 personal 	 ities 	 	just	like	our	 dog 	 s 	 	and	our	 cat 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	collect	our	information	and	 be 	 come 	 	more	 techno 	 logically 	 	 liter 	 ate 	 	.
so	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	that	in	 computer 	 s 	 	in	the	field	.
and	 penguin 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 help 	 ing 	 	us	or	not	 help 	 ing 	 	us	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	radio	frequency	id	system	.
you	put	a	little	piece	of	rice	in	the	foot	of	a	penguin	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 bar 	 code 	 	,	so	it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	who	it	is	.
it	 walk 	 s 	 	over	the	pad	,	and	you	know	who	it	is	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	here	are	a	few	 penguin 	 s 	 	coming	in	.
see	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	coming	back	to	 it 	 s 	 	nest	.
they	're	all	coming	in	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	there	,	just	kind	of	 leisure 	 ly 	 	coming	in	.
here	's	a	female	that	's	in	a	 hur 	 ry 	 	.	she	's	got	food	.
she	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 rush 	 ing 	 	back	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	hot	,	to	try	to	feed	her	 chick 	 s 	 	.
and	then	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	fellow	that	will	 leisure 	 ly 	 	come	by	.
look	how	fat	he	is	.	he	's	 walk 	 ing 	 	back	to	feed	his	 chick 	 s 	 	.
then	i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	they	're	 play 	 ing 	 	king	of	the	box	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	box	up	here	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	system	that	 work 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	penguin	,	he	 go 	 es 	 	over	,	he	 look 	 s 	 	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 wire 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	not	like	that	wire	.
he	 un 	 plug 	 s 	 	the	wire	;	we	have	no	data	.
so	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
ok	.
most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	:	 on 	 ly 	 	you	can	change	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	you	can	change	the	world	and	make	it	better	,	for	people	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
so	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
