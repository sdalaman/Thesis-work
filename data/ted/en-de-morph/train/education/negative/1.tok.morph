thank	you	so	much	,	chris	.	and	it	's	 tru 	 ly 	 	a	great	honor	to	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	stage	twice	.	i	'm	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	.
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	blown	away	by	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	and	i	want	to	thank	all	of	you	for	the	 man 	 y 	 	nice	 comment 	 s 	 	about	what	i	had	to	say	the	other	night	.
and	i	say	that	 since 	 re 	 ly 	 	,	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	--	--	i	need	that	!
put	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	my	position	!
i	flew	on	air	force	two	for	eight	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	i	have	to	take	off	my	 shoe 	 s 	 	or	 boot 	 s 	 	to	get	on	an	 air 	 plane 	 	!
i	'll	tell	you	one	quick	story	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	what	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	like	for	me	.
it	's	a	true	story	--	every	bit	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	.
soon	after	tipper	and	i	left	the	--	--	white	house	--	--	we	 we 	 re 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	from	our	home	in	nashville	to	a	little	farm	we	have	50	 mile 	 s 	 	east	of	nashville	--	 driv 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	know	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	little	thing	to	you	,	but	--	--	i	 look 	 ed 	 	in	the	 rear 	 view 	 	mirror	and	all	of	a	sudden	it	just	hit	me	.
there	was	no	 motor 	 ca 	 de 	 	back	there	.
you	've	heard	of	phantom	limb	pain	?
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 rent 	 ed 	 	ford	taurus	.	it	was	 d 	 inner 	 time 	 	,	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	for	a	place	to	eat	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	on	i	-	40	.	we	got	to	exit	238	,	lebanon	,	tennessee	.
we	got	off	the	exit	,	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	for	a	--	we	found	a	shoney	's	restaurant	.
low	-	cost	family	restaurant	chain	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	know	it	.
we	went	in	and	 s 	 at 	 	down	at	the	booth	,	and	the	 wait 	 re 	 s 	 s 	 	came	over	,	made	a	big	 com 	 motion 	 	over	tipper	.
she	took	our	order	,	and	then	went	to	the	couple	in	the	booth	next	to	us	,	and	she	 lower 	 ed 	 	her	voice	so	much	i	had	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 train 	 	to	hear	what	she	was	 say 	 ing 	 	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	's	 form 	 er 	 	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	al	gore	and	his	wife	tipper	.	``
and	the	man	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	he	's	come	down	a	long	way	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	he	?	``
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	kind	of	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 epiph 	 anie 	 s 	 	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	next	day	,	 continu 	 ing 	 	a	 total 	 ly 	 	true	story	,	i	got	on	a	g	-	5	to	fly	to	africa	to	make	a	speech	in	nigeria	,	in	the	city	of	lagos	,	on	the	 top 	 ic 	 	of	energy	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	the	speech	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	the	story	of	what	had	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	the	day	before	in	nashville	.
i	told	it	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	same	way	i	've	just	 share 	 d 	 	it	with	you	:	tipper	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	shoney	's	,	low	-	cost	family	restaurant	chain	,	what	the	man	 s 	 aid 	 	--	they	 laugh 	 ed 	 	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	my	speech	,	then	went	back	out	to	the	 air 	 port 	 	to	fly	back	home	.
i	fell	 a 	 sleep 	 	on	the	plane	,	 un 	 til 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	middle	of	the	night	,	we	 land 	 ed 	 	on	the	azores	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	for	 re 	 fuel 	 ing 	 	.
i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	,	they	 open 	 ed 	 	the	door	,	i	went	out	to	get	some	fresh	air	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	and	there	was	a	man	running	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 run 	 way 	 	.
and	he	was	 wav 	 ing 	 	a	piece	of	paper	,	and	he	was	 yell 	 ing 	 	,	``	call	washington	!	call	washington	!	``
and	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	in	the	middle	of	the	night	,	in	the	middle	of	the	atlantic	,	what	in	the	world	could	be	wrong	in	washington	?
then	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	it	could	be	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	what	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	was	that	my	staff	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 up 	 set 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	wire	 service 	 s 	 	in	nigeria	had	 al 	 ready 	 	written	a	story	about	my	speech	.
and	it	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 print 	 ed 	 	in	cities	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	--	it	was	 print 	 ed 	 	in	monterey	,	i	 check 	 ed 	 	.	and	the	story	 beg 	 an 	 	,	``	 form 	 er 	 	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	al	gore	 announce 	 d 	 	in	nigeria	 yester 	 day 	 	,	'	my	wife	tipper	and	i	have	 open 	 ed 	 	a	low	-	cost	family	restaurant	,	named	shoney	's	,	and	we	are	running	it	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.

three	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	got	a	nice	,	long	,	 hand 	 written 	 	letter	from	my	friend	and	partner	and	 col 	 league 	 	bill	clinton	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 congratula 	 tions 	 	on	the	new	restaurant	,	al	!	``
we	like	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	each	other	's	 success 	 es 	 	in	life	.
i	was	going	to	talk	about	information	 eco 	 logy 	 	.
but	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	that	since	i	plan	to	make	a	 life 	 long 	 	habit	of	coming	back	to	ted	,	that	 may 	 be 	 	i	could	talk	about	that	 an 	 other 	 	time	.
chris	anderson	:	it	's	a	deal	!
al	gore	:	i	want	to	focus	on	what	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 s 	 aid 	 	you	would	like	me	to	elaborate	on	.
what	can	you	do	about	the	climate	crisis	?	i	want	to	start	with	--	i	'm	going	to	show	some	new	 image 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	recapitulate	just	four	or	five	.
now	,	the	slide	show	.	i	update	the	slide	show	every	time	i	give	it	.
i	add	new	 image 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	learn	more	about	it	every	time	i	give	it	.
it	's	like	 beach 	 comb 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	?	every	time	the	tide	 come 	 s 	 	in	and	out	,	you	find	some	more	 shell 	 s 	 	.
just	in	the	last	two	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	got	the	new	temperature	 record 	 s 	 	in	january	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	for	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	.	 historic 	 al 	 	average	for	january	is	31	 degree 	 s 	 	.	last	month	was	39.5	 degree 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	know	that	you	 want 	 ed 	 	some	more	bad	news	about	the	environment	--	i	'm	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	--	but	these	are	the	 re 	 cap 	 it 	 ul 	 ation 	 	 slide 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	'm	going	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	new	material	about	what	you	can	do	.
but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	elaborate	on	a	couple	of	these	.
first	of	all	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	're	 project 	 ed 	 	to	go	with	the	u.s.	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	under	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.	efficiency	in	end	-	use	 electric 	 ity 	 	and	end	-	use	of	all	energy	is	the	low	-	 hang 	 ing 	 	fruit	.	efficiency	and	 conserv 	 ation 	 	:	it	's	not	a	cost	;	it	's	a	profit	.	the	sign	is	wrong	.
it	's	not	negative	;	it	's	positive	.	these	are	 invest 	 ments 	 	that	pay	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	in	 deflect 	 ing 	 	our	path	.
 car 	 s 	 	and	 truck 	 s 	 	--	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	that	in	the	 slide 	 show 	 	,	but	i	want	you	to	put	it	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	an	easy	,	visible	target	of	concern	,	and	it	should	be	,	but	there	is	more	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	 building 	 s 	 	than	from	 car 	 s 	 	and	 truck 	 s 	 	.
 car 	 s 	 	and	 truck 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	,	and	we	have	the	 low 	 est 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	and	so	we	should	address	that	.	but	it	's	part	of	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
other	 transport 	 ation 	 	efficiency	is	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 car 	 s 	 	and	 truck 	 s 	 	!
 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	at	the	current	 level 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	efficiency	can	make	 th 	 is 	 	much	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	with	what	vinod	,	and	john	doerr	,	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	--	a	lot	of	people	 direct 	 ly 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	wedge	is	going	to	grow	much	more	 rapid 	 ly 	 	than	the	current	 project 	 ion 	 	 show 	 s 	 	it	.
carbon	capture	and	 sequest 	 ration 	 	--	that	's	what	ccs	 stand 	 s 	 	for	--	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	killer	app	that	will	 en 	 able 	 	us	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	use	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	in	a	way	that	is	safe	.
not	 quit 	 e 	 	there	yet	.
ok	.	now	,	what	can	you	do	?	 reduc 	 e 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	in	your	home	.
most	of	these	 expend 	 iture 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 profit 	 able 	 	.
 insula 	 tion 	 	,	better	design	,	buy	green	 electric 	 ity 	 	where	you	can	.
i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	--	buy	a	hybrid	.	use	light	rail	.
figure	out	some	of	the	other	 option 	 s 	 	that	are	much	better	.	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	.
be	a	green	consumer	.	you	have	 choice 	 s 	 	with	 every 	 thing 	 	you	buy	,	between	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	a	harsh	effect	or	a	much	less	harsh	effect	on	the	global	climate	crisis	.
consider	 th 	 is 	 	.	make	a	decision	to	live	a	carbon	-	neutral	life	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	good	at	 brand 	 ing 	 	,	i	'd	love	to	get	your	 ad 	 vice 	 	and	help	on	how	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	way	that	 connect 	 s 	 	with	the	most	people	.
it	is	 eas 	 ier 	 	than	you	think	.	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
a	lot	of	us	in	here	have	made	that	decision	and	it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	easy	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	:	 reduc 	 e 	 	your	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	with	the	full	range	of	 choice 	 s 	 	that	you	make	,	and	then	purchase	or	 acquir 	 e 	 	 off 	 set 	 s 	 	for	the	 remain 	 der 	 	that	you	have	not	 complete 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	.	and	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	is	 elaborate 	 d 	 	at	climatecrisis	.	net	.
there	is	a	carbon	 calcul 	 ator 	 	.	 particip 	 ant 	 	 production 	 s 	 	 conven 	 ed 	 	,	with	my	active	 involve 	 ment 	 	,	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	in	the	world	on	 th 	 is 	 	 arc 	 ane 	 	science	of	carbon	 calcul 	 ation 	 	to	construct	a	consumer	-	friendly	carbon	 calcul 	 ator 	 	.
you	can	 ver 	 y 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	 calcul 	 ate 	 	what	your	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	are	,	and	then	you	will	be	 give 	 n 	 	 option 	 s 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	.
and	by	the	time	the	movie	 come 	 s 	 	out	in	may	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	 update 	 d 	 	to	2.0	and	we	will	have	click	-	through	 purchase 	 s 	 	of	 off 	 set 	 s 	 	.
next	,	consider	making	your	business	carbon	-	neutral	.	 aga 	 in 	 	,	some	of	us	have	 d 	 one 	 	that	,	and	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	hard	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	.	integrate	climate	 solution 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	all	of	your	 innov 	 ations 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	are	from	the	technology	,	or	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	or	design	and	 architect 	 ure 	 	community	.
invest	 sustain 	 ably 	 	.	majora	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
listen	,	if	you	have	 invest 	 ed 	 	money	with	 manage 	 rs 	 	who	you	 compens 	 ate 	 	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	annual	performance	,	do	n't	ever	 aga 	 in 	 	complain	about	 quarter 	 ly 	 	report	ceo	management	.
over	time	,	people	do	what	you	pay	them	to	do	.	and	if	they	 judg 	 e 	 	how	much	they	're	going	to	get	paid	on	your	capital	that	they	've	 invest 	 ed 	 	,	based	on	the	short	-	term	 return 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	to	get	short	-	term	 decision 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	more	to	be	 s 	 aid 	 	about	that	.
 be 	 come 	 	a	catalyst	of	change	.	teach	 other 	 s 	 	;	learn	about	it	;	talk	about	it	.
the	movie	 come 	 s 	 	out	--	the	movie	is	a	movie	version	of	the	 slide 	 show 	 	i	 g 	 ave 	 	two	 night 	 s 	 	ago	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	it	's	a	lot	more	 entertain 	 ing 	 	.	and	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	in	may	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	ensure	that	a	lot	of	people	see	it	.
consider	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	to	nashville	.	pick	well	.
and	i	am	 personal 	 ly 	 	going	to	train	people	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	 slide 	 show 	 	,	re	-	 purpose 	 d 	 	,	with	some	of	the	personal	 st 	 ories 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	with	a	generic	approach	,	and	--	it	's	not	just	the	 slide 	 s 	 	,	it	's	what	they	mean	.	and	it	's	how	they	link	together	.
and	so	i	'm	going	to	be	 conduct 	 ing 	 	a	course	 th 	 is 	 	summer	for	a	group	of	people	that	are	 nominate 	 d 	 	by	different	 folk 	 s 	 	to	come	and	then	give	it	,	en	masse	,	in	 commun 	 ities 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	,	and	we	're	going	to	update	the	 slide 	 show 	 	for	all	of	them	every	single	week	to	keep	it	right	on	the	cutting	edge	.
 work 	 ing 	 	with	larry	lessig	,	it	will	be	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	that	process	,	 post 	 ed 	 	with	 tool 	 s 	 	and	 limit 	 ed 	 	-	use	 copy 	 right 	 s 	 	,	so	that	young	people	can	remix	it	and	do	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	way	.
where	did	 any 	 body 	 	get	the	idea	that	you	ought	to	stay	arm	's	length	from	 politic 	 s 	 	?
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	if	you	are	a	republican	that	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	to	be	a	democrat	.	we	need	republicans	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	 th 	 is 	 	used	to	be	a	 bi 	 partisan 	 	issue	,	and	i	know	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	group	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.	 be 	 come 	 	 politic 	 ally 	 	active	.
make	our	 demo 	 cracy 	 	work	the	way	it	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	work	.
support	the	idea	of	 cap 	 ping 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	and	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	it	.	here	's	why	:	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	out	of	the	world	system	,	it	's	not	a	closed	system	.
once	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	closed	system	,	with	u.s.	 particip 	 ation 	 	,	then	 every 	 body 	 	who	's	on	a	board	of	 director 	 s 	 	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	serve	on	the	board	of	 director 	 s 	 	of	a	corporation	?
once	it	's	a	closed	system	,	you	will	have	legal	 li 	 ability 	 	if	you	do	not	urge	your	ceo	to	get	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	income	from	 reduc 	 ing 	 	and	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	the	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 avoid 	 ed 	 	.	the	market	will	work	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	if	we	can	accomplish	 th 	 is 	 	.
help	with	the	mass	 persuas 	 ion 	 	campaign	that	will	start	 th 	 is 	 	spring	.
we	have	to	change	the	 mind 	 s 	 	of	the	american	people	.	 be 	 cause 	 	 present 	 ly 	 	the	 politic 	 ians 	 	do	not	have	 per 	 mission 	 	to	do	what	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	in	our	modern	country	,	the	role	of	logic	and	reason	no	 long 	 er 	 	 include 	 s 	 	 media 	 ting 	 	between	wealth	and	power	the	way	it	once	did	.
it	's	now	 re 	 petition 	 	of	short	,	hot	-	button	,	30	-	second	,	28	-	second	 tele 	 vision 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	buy	a	lot	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	.
let	's	 re 	 brand 	 	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 suggest 	 ed 	 	.
i	like	``	climate	crisis	``	 in 	 stead 	 	of	``	climate	collapse	,	``	but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	good	at	 brand 	 ing 	 	,	i	need	your	help	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	the	test	we	're	facing	now	,	a	scientist	told	me	,	is	 whet 	 her 	 	the	combination	of	an	 oppos 	 able 	 	thumb	and	a	 neo 	 cortex 	 	is	a	 vi 	 able 	 	combination	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	true	.	i	 s 	 aid 	 	the	other	night	,	and	i	'll	repeat	now	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 politic 	 al 	 	issue	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	republicans	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	should	n't	be	partisan	.
you	have	more	influence	than	some	of	us	who	are	 democrat 	 s 	 	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	not	just	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	here	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	more	 cohere 	 nce 	 	to	them	.
we	are	one	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	i	appreciate	it	.
