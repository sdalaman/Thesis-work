the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	you	saw	here	for	a	brief	moment	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	levitation	and	 quant 	 um 	 	 lock 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	object	that	was	 levit 	 ating 	 	here	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	superconductor	.
superconductivity	is	a	 quant 	 um 	 	state	of	matter	,	and	it	 occur 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 low 	 	a	certain	critical	temperature	.
now	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	an	old	 phenomen 	 on 	 	;	it	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	due	to	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	 advance 	 ments 	 	,	we	are	now	able	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	to	you	 quant 	 um 	 	levitation	and	 quant 	 um 	 	 lock 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	a	superconductor	is	defined	by	two	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
the	first	is	zero	 electric 	 al 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	,	and	the	second	is	the	 ex 	 pulsion 	 	of	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	from	the	 in 	 terior 	 	of	the	superconductor	.
that	 sound 	 s 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	right	?
but	what	is	 electric 	 al 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	?
so	,	 electric 	 ity 	 	is	the	flow	of	 electron 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	a	material	.
and	these	 electron 	 s 	 	,	while	 flow 	 ing 	 	,	they	collide	with	the	 atom 	 s 	 	,	and	in	these	 collision 	 s 	 	they	lose	a	certain	amount	of	energy	.
and	they	dissipate	 th 	 is 	 	energy	in	the	form	of	heat	,	and	you	know	that	effect	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 in 	 side 	 	a	superconductor	there	are	no	 collision 	 s 	 	,	so	there	is	no	energy	dissipation	.
it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	.	think	about	it	.
in	 classic 	 al 	 	physics	,	there	is	 al 	 ways 	 	some	friction	,	some	energy	loss	.
but	not	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	a	 quant 	 um 	 	effect	.
but	that	's	not	all	,	 be 	 cause 	 	superconductors	do	n't	like	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 field 	 s 	 	.
so	a	superconductor	will	try	to	expel	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 mean 	 s 	 	to	do	that	by	 circul 	 ating 	 	 current 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	combination	of	both	 effect 	 s 	 	--	the	 ex 	 pulsion 	 	of	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 field 	 s 	 	and	zero	 electric 	 al 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	--	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	a	superconductor	.
but	the	picture	is	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	perfect	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	all	know	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 strand 	 s 	 	of	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	remain	 in 	 side 	 	the	superconductor	.
now	,	under	proper	 condition 	 s 	 	,	which	we	have	here	,	these	 strand 	 s 	 	of	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	can	be	trapped	 in 	 side 	 	the	superconductor	.
and	these	 strand 	 s 	 	of	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	 in 	 side 	 	the	superconductor	,	they	come	in	discrete	 quant 	 ities 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	a	 quant 	 um 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.	it	's	 quant 	 um 	 	physics	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	they	 behav 	 e 	 	like	 quant 	 um 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	movie	here	,	you	can	see	how	they	flow	one	by	one	 discrete 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 strand 	 s 	 	of	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	.	these	are	not	 particle 	 s 	 	,	but	they	 behav 	 e 	 	like	 particle 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	effect	 quant 	 um 	 	levitation	and	 quant 	 um 	 	 lock 	 ing 	 	.
but	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	superconductor	when	we	put	it	 in 	 side 	 	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	?
well	,	first	there	are	 strand 	 s 	 	of	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	left	 in 	 side 	 	,	but	now	the	superconductor	 do 	 es 	 	n't	like	them	moving	around	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	dissipate	energy	,	which	 break 	 s 	 	the	superconductivity	state	.
so	what	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	it	 lock 	 s 	 	these	 strand 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 call 	 ed 	 	fluxons	,	and	it	 lock 	 s 	 	these	fluxons	in	place	.
and	by	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	what	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	is	 lock 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	place	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	any	 move 	 ment 	 	of	the	superconductor	will	change	 the 	 ir 	 	place	,	will	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 configu 	 ration 	 	.
so	we	get	 quant 	 um 	 	 lock 	 ing 	 	.	and	let	me	show	you	how	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
i	have	here	a	superconductor	,	which	i	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	so	it	'd	stay	cold	long	 en 	 ough 	 	.
and	when	i	place	it	on	top	of	a	regular	magnet	,	it	just	 stay 	 s 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	levitation	.	it	's	not	just	 re 	 pulsion 	 	.
i	can	 re 	 arrange 	 	the	fluxons	,	and	it	will	be	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	 configu 	 ration 	 	.
like	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	move	it	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	to	the	right	or	to	the	left	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 quant 	 um 	 	 lock 	 ing 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	 lock 	 ing 	 	--	three	-	dimensional	 lock 	 ing 	 	of	the	superconductor	.
of	course	,	i	can	turn	it	 up 	 side 	 	down	,	and	it	will	remain	 lock 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	now	that	we	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	levitation	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 lock 	 ing 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	understand	that	.
you	wo	n't	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	hear	that	if	i	take	 th 	 is 	 	 circul 	 ar 	 	magnet	,	in	which	the	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	is	the	same	all	around	,	the	superconductor	will	be	able	to	 free 	 ly 	 	 rot 	 ate 	 	around	the	axis	of	the	magnet	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	 rot 	 ates 	 	,	the	 lock 	 ing 	 	is	 maintain 	 ed 	 	.
you	see	?	i	can	adjust	and	i	can	 rot 	 ate 	 	the	superconductor	.
we	have	 friction 	 less 	 	motion	.	it	is	still	 levit 	 ating 	 	,	but	can	move	 free 	 ly 	 	all	around	.
so	,	we	have	 quant 	 um 	 	 lock 	 ing 	 	and	we	can	 levit 	 ate 	 	it	on	top	of	 th 	 is 	 	magnet	.
but	how	 man 	 y 	 	fluxons	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 strand 	 s 	 	are	there	in	a	single	 dis 	 k 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	we	can	 calcul 	 ate 	 	it	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	.
one	hundred	billion	 strand 	 s 	 	of	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	three	-	inch	 dis 	 k 	 	.
but	that	's	not	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	part	yet	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	have	n't	told	you	yet	.
and	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	part	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	superconductor	that	you	see	here	is	 on 	 ly 	 	half	a	 micro 	 n 	 	thick	.	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	thin	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	thin	layer	is	able	to	 levit 	 ate 	 	more	than	70,000	 time 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	weight	.
it	's	a	 remark 	 able 	 	effect	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	.
now	,	i	can	extend	 th 	 is 	 	 circul 	 ar 	 	magnet	,	and	make	 what 	 ever 	 	track	i	want	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	can	make	a	large	 circul 	 ar 	 	rail	here	.
and	when	i	place	the	 super 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	on	top	of	 th 	 is 	 	rail	,	it	 move 	 s 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	's	not	all	.	i	can	adjust	 it 	 s 	 	position	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 rot 	 ate 	 	,	and	it	 free 	 ly 	 	 move 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	position	.
and	i	can	even	try	a	new	thing	;	let	's	try	it	for	the	first	time	.
i	can	take	 th 	 is 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	and	put	it	here	,	and	while	it	 stay 	 s 	 	here	--	do	n't	move	--	i	will	try	to	 rot 	 ate 	 	the	track	,	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	if	i	did	it	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	it	 stay 	 s 	 	 suspend 	 ed 	 	.
you	see	,	it	's	 quant 	 um 	 	 lock 	 ing 	 	,	not	levitation	.
now	,	while	i	'll	let	it	 circul 	 ate 	 	for	a	little	more	,	let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	superconductors	.
now	--	--	so	we	now	know	that	we	are	able	to	transfer	enormous	amount	of	 current 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	superconductors	,	so	we	can	use	them	to	produce	strong	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 field 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	in	mri	 machine 	 s 	 	,	particle	 accele 	 rator 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
but	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	store	energy	using	superconductors	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	no	dissipation	.
and	we	could	 al 	 so 	 	produce	power	 cable 	 s 	 	,	to	transfer	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	current	between	power	 station 	 s 	 	.
imagine	you	could	back	up	a	single	power	station	with	a	single	 super 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	cable	.
but	what	is	the	future	of	 quant 	 um 	 	levitation	and	 quant 	 um 	 	 lock 	 ing 	 	?
well	,	let	me	answer	 th 	 is 	 	simple	question	by	giving	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
imagine	you	would	have	a	 dis 	 k 	 	similar	to	the	one	i	have	here	in	my	hand	,	three	-	inch	 dia 	 meter 	 	,	with	a	single	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
the	 super 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	layer	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	half	a	 micro 	 n 	 	thin	,	 be 	 ing 	 	two	 millimeter 	 s 	 	thin	,	 quit 	 e 	 	thin	.
 th 	 is 	 	two	-	millimeter	-	thin	 super 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	layer	could	hold	1,000	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	,	a	small	car	,	in	my	hand	.
 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	thank	you	.
