planetary	 system 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	our	own	are	like	 di 	 stant 	 	cities	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 light 	 s 	 	we	can	see	 twinkl 	 ing 	 	,	but	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 street 	 s 	 	we	ca	n't	walk	.
by	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 twinkl 	 ing 	 	 light 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	we	can	learn	about	how	 star 	 s 	 	and	 planet 	 s 	 	interact	to	form	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 eco 	 system 	 	and	make	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	that	are	 a 	 men 	 able 	 	to	life	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	image	of	the	tokyo	 sky 	 line 	 	,	i	've	 hid 	 den 	 	data	from	the	 new 	 est 	 	planet	-	 hunt 	 ing 	 	space	 tele 	 scope 	 	on	the	block	,	the	kepler	mission	.
can	you	see	it	?
there	we	go	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	 tin 	 y 	 	part	of	the	sky	the	kepler	 star 	 es 	 	at	,	where	it	 search 	 es 	 	for	 planet 	 s 	 	by	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	light	from	over	150,000	 star 	 s 	 	,	all	at	once	,	every	half	hour	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	.
and	what	we	're	looking	for	is	the	 tin 	 y 	 	 dimm 	 ing 	 	of	light	that	is	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	a	planet	 pass 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	one	of	these	 star 	 s 	 	and	 block 	 ing 	 	some	of	that	 star 	 light 	 	from	 get 	 ting 	 	to	us	.
in	just	over	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	 operation 	 s 	 	,	we	've	found	over	1,200	potential	new	planetary	 system 	 s 	 	around	other	 star 	 s 	 	.
to	give	you	some	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	in	the	previous	two	 decade 	 s 	 	of	 search 	 ing 	 	,	we	had	 on 	 ly 	 	known	about	400	prior	to	kepler	.
when	we	see	these	little	 dip 	 s 	 	in	the	light	,	we	can	determine	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
for	one	thing	,	we	can	determine	that	there	's	a	planet	there	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	how	big	that	planet	is	and	how	far	it	is	away	from	 it 	 s 	 	parent	star	.
that	distance	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	how	much	light	the	planet	 receiv 	 es 	 	 over 	 all 	 	.
and	that	distance	and	 know 	 ing 	 	that	amount	of	light	is	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	little	like	you	or	i	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	around	a	 camp 	 fire 	 	:	you	want	to	be	close	 en 	 ough 	 	to	the	 camp 	 fire 	 	so	that	you	're	warm	,	but	not	so	close	that	you	're	too	 toast 	 y 	 	and	you	get	 burn 	 ed 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	there	's	more	to	know	about	your	parent	star	than	just	how	much	light	you	 receiv 	 e 	 	 over 	 all 	 	.
and	i	'll	tell	you	why	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	star	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	 s 	 un 	 	.
it	's	 show 	 n 	 	here	in	visible	light	.
that	's	the	light	that	you	can	see	with	your	own	human	 eye 	 s 	 	.
you	'll	notice	that	it	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	like	the	 icon 	 ic 	 	yellow	ball	--	that	 s 	 un 	 	that	we	all	draw	when	we	're	children	.
but	you	'll	notice	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	and	that	's	that	the	face	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 fre 	 ck 	 les 	 	.
these	 fre 	 ck 	 les 	 	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 s 	 un 	 spot 	 s 	 	,	and	they	are	just	one	of	the	 manifest 	 ations 	 	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	cause	the	light	from	the	star	to	vary	.
and	we	can	measure	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	with	kepler	and	trace	 the 	 ir 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	these	are	just	the	tip	of	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	.
if	we	had	uv	 eye 	 s 	 	or	x	-	ray	 eye 	 s 	 	,	we	would	 re 	 ally 	 	see	the	dynamic	and	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	of	our	 s 	 un 	 	's	 magnet 	 ic 	 	activity	--	the	kind	of	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	on	other	 star 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
just	think	,	even	when	it	's	 cloud 	 y 	 	 out 	 side 	 	,	these	kind	of	 event 	 s 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	sky	above	you	all	the	time	.
so	when	we	want	to	learn	 whet 	 her 	 	a	planet	is	 habit 	 able 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	might	be	 a 	 men 	 able 	 	to	life	,	we	want	to	know	not	 on 	 ly 	 	how	much	total	light	it	 receiv 	 es 	 	and	how	warm	it	is	,	but	we	want	to	know	about	 it 	 s 	 	space	weather	--	 th 	 is 	 	high	-	energy	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	the	uv	and	the	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	that	are	 create 	 d 	 	by	 it 	 s 	 	star	and	that	 bath 	 e 	 	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	bath	of	high	-	energy	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
and	so	,	we	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	look	at	 planet 	 s 	 	around	other	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	same	kind	of	detail	that	we	can	look	at	 planet 	 s 	 	in	our	own	solar	system	.
i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	here	venus	,	earth	and	mars	--	three	 planet 	 s 	 	in	our	own	solar	system	that	are	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	good	place	to	live	.
but	what	we	can	do	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	is	measure	the	light	from	our	 star 	 s 	 	and	learn	about	 th 	 is 	 	relationship	between	the	 planet 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	parent	 star 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 us 	 s 	 	out	 clue 	 s 	 	about	which	 planet 	 s 	 	might	be	good	 place 	 s 	 	to	look	for	life	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
kepler	wo	n't	find	a	planet	around	every	single	star	it	 look 	 s 	 	at	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	,	every	 measure 	 ment 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	is	precious	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 teach 	 ing 	 	us	about	the	relationship	between	 star 	 s 	 	and	 planet 	 s 	 	,	and	how	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 star 	 light 	 	that	 set 	 s 	 	the	stage	for	the	 form 	 ation 	 	of	life	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
while	it	's	kepler	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	the	instrument	that	 star 	 es 	 	,	it	's	we	,	life	,	who	are	 search 	 ing 	 	.
thank	you	.
