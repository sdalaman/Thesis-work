one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	writing	,	and	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	looking	at	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	 separat 	 e 	 	fashion	from	deep	change	.
and	so	,	to	start	 help 	 ing 	 	that	,	i	want	to	take	us	back	to	1835	.
in	1835	,	james	gordon	bennett	 found 	 ed 	 	the	first	mass	-	 circul 	 ation 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	in	new	york	city	.
and	it	cost	about	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	start	it	,	which	was	about	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	.
by	15	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	by	1850	,	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	--	 start 	 ing 	 	what	was	 experience 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	mass	--	 circul 	 ation 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	paper	--	would	come	to	cost	two	and	a	half	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
10,000	,	two	and	a	half	million	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	critical	change	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 in 	 vert 	 ed 	 	by	the	net	.
and	that	's	what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	how	that	 relat 	 es 	 	to	the	emergence	of	social	production	.
 start 	 ing 	 	with	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	what	we	saw	was	high	cost	 a 	 s 	 	an	 initi 	 al 	 	 requir 	 ement 	 	for	making	information	,	knowledge	and	culture	,	which	led	to	a	 star 	 k 	 	 bifurc 	 ation 	 	between	 produce 	 rs 	 	--	who	had	to	be	able	to	raise	financial	capital	,	just	like	any	other	industrial	 organ 	 ization 	 	--	and	 pass 	 ive 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	that	could	 choos 	 e 	 	from	a	certain	set	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	industrial	model	could	produce	.
now	,	the	term	``	information	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	``	``	information	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	``	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	used	 a 	 s 	 	the	thing	that	 come 	 s 	 	after	the	industrial	revolution	.	but	in	fact	,	for	 purpose 	 s 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	's	wrong	.	 be 	 cause 	 	for	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	had	an	information	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
it	's	just	 be 	 en 	 	industrial	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	producing	had	to	have	a	way	of	raising	money	to	pay	 t 	 hose 	 	two	and	a	half	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	 lat 	 er 	 	,	more	for	the	 tele 	 graph 	 	,	and	the	radio	 transmit 	 ter 	 	,	and	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	the	 main 	 frame 	 	.
and	that	 me 	 ant 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	market	based	,	or	they	 we 	 re 	 	government	owned	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	what	kind	of	system	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	 character 	 ized 	 	and	 anchor 	 ed 	 	the	way	information	and	knowledge	 we 	 re 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	for	the	next	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	,	let	me	tell	you	a	different	story	.	around	june	2002	,	the	world	of	 super 	 computer 	 s 	 	had	a	 bomb 	 shell 	 	.
the	japanese	had	,	for	the	first	time	,	 create 	 d 	 	the	 fast 	 est 	 	 super 	 computer 	 	--	the	nec	earth	 simul 	 ator 	 	--	taking	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	from	the	u.s.	,	and	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	,	by	the	way	,	is	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	trillion	 float 	 ing 	 	-	point	 operation 	 s 	 	per	second	that	the	computer	's	 cap 	 able 	 	of	running	--	 sig 	 h 	 	of	relief	:	ibm	[	blue	gene	]	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 ed 	 ged 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	nec	earth	 simul 	 ator 	 	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 es 	 	the	fact	that	 through 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	period	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 super 	 computer 	 	running	in	the	world	--	seti	@	home	.
four	and	a	half	million	 user 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 left 	 over 	 	computer	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	 when 	 ever 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	computer	is	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	,	by	running	a	screen	saver	,	and	together	sharing	 the 	 ir 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	to	create	a	massive	 super 	 computer 	 	that	nasa	 harness 	 es 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	data	coming	from	radio	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 suggest 	 s 	 	to	us	is	that	we	've	got	a	radical	change	in	the	way	information	production	and	 ex 	 change 	 	is	 capital 	 ized 	 	.	not	that	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	less	capital	intensive	--	that	there	's	less	money	that	's	 requir 	 ed 	 	--	but	that	the	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	capital	,	the	way	the	 capital 	 ization 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	is	 radical 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	.	each	of	us	,	in	these	 advance 	 d 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	one	of	these	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	like	it	--	a	computer	.
they	're	not	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	from	 route 	 rs 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	middle	of	the	network	.
and	computation	,	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	and	 communication 	 s 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	are	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 practical 	 ly 	 	every	 connect 	 ed 	 	person	--	and	these	are	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	physical	capital	 mean 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	producing	information	,	knowledge	and	culture	,	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	like	600	million	to	a	billion	people	around	the	planet	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	for	the	first	time	since	the	industrial	revolution	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 component 	 s 	 	of	the	core	economic	 activ 	 ities 	 	--	remember	,	we	are	in	an	information	 eco 	 nomy 	 	--	of	the	most	 advance 	 d 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	and	there	more	than	 any 	 where 	 	else	,	are	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	the	population	at	large	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	than	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	since	the	industrial	revolution	.	so	we	've	got	 communication 	 s 	 	and	computation	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	the	entire	population	,	and	we	've	got	human	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	human	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	human	experience	--	the	other	major	experience	,	the	other	major	 in 	 put 	 	--	which	 un 	 like 	 	simple	labor	--	stand	here	 turn 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	lever	all	day	long	--	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	the	same	or	fungible	among	people	.
any	one	of	you	who	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	job	,	or	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	give	 your 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 one 	 	else	,	no	matter	how	 detail 	 ed 	 	the	manual	,	you	can	not	transmit	what	you	know	,	what	you	will	intuit	under	a	certain	set	of	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
in	that	we	're	 un 	 ique 	 	,	and	each	of	us	 hold 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	critical	 in 	 put 	 	 in 	 to 	 	production	 a 	 s 	 	we	hold	 th 	 is 	 	machine	.
what	's	the	effect	of	 th 	 is 	 	?	so	,	the	story	that	most	people	know	is	the	story	of	free	or	open	source	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	market	share	of	apache	web	 serv 	 er 	 	--	one	of	the	critical	 application 	 s 	 	in	web	-	based	 communication 	 s 	 	.
in	1995	,	two	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	the	web	!	we	need	a	much	better	web	 serv 	 er 	 	!	``
one	was	a	 mot 	 ley 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 volunteer 	 s 	 	who	just	 decide 	 d 	 	,	you	know	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	should	write	one	,	and	what	are	we	going	to	do	with	what	--	well	,	we	're	gon	na	share	it	!	and	other	people	will	be	able	to	develop	it	.
the	other	was	 micro 	 soft 	 	.
now	,	if	i	told	you	that	10	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	 mot 	 ley 	 	crew	of	people	,	who	did	n't	control	 any 	 thing 	 	that	they	 produce 	 d 	 	,	 acquir 	 ed 	 	20	percent	of	the	market	and	was	the	red	line	,	it	would	be	 amaz 	 ing 	 	!	right	?
think	of	it	in	 mini 	 van 	 s 	 	.	a	group	of	 auto 	 mobile 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	are	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	toyota	.	right	?
but	,	in	fact	,	of	course	,	the	story	is	it	's	the	70	percent	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	major	 e 	 - 	 commerce 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	--	70	percent	of	a	critical	application	on	which	web	-	based	 communication 	 s 	 	and	 application 	 s 	 	work	is	 produce 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	form	,	in	direct	 com 	 petition 	 	with	 micro 	 soft 	 	.	not	in	a	side	issue	--	in	a	central	 strat 	 egic 	 	decision	to	try	to	capture	a	component	of	the	net	.
 soft 	 ware 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	way	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	visible	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 measur 	 able 	 	.	but	the	thing	to	see	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	web	.
so	,	nasa	,	at	some	point	,	did	an	experiment	where	they	took	 image 	 s 	 	of	mars	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	mapping	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	three	or	four	fully	trained	ph	.	d.	s	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	the	time	,	let	's	break	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	small	 component 	 s 	 	,	put	it	up	on	the	web	,	and	see	if	people	,	using	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 inter 	 face 	 	,	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	five	 minute 	 s 	 	here	,	10	 minute 	 s 	 	there	,	 click 	 ing 	 	.	after	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	85,000	people	used	 th 	 is 	 	to	generate	mapping	at	a	 fast 	 er 	 	rate	than	the	 image 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	in	,	which	was	,	quote	,	``	 practical 	 ly 	 	 in 	 distinguish 	 able 	 	from	the	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	a	fully	-	trained	ph.d.	,	``	once	you	 show 	 ed 	 	it	to	a	number	of	people	and	 compute 	 d 	 	the	average	.
now	,	if	you	have	a	little	girl	,	and	she	 go 	 es 	 	and	 write 	 s 	 	to	--	well	,	not	so	little	,	medium	little	--	tries	to	do	research	on	barbie	.
and	she	'll	come	to	encarta	,	one	of	the	main	 on 	 line 	 	 encyclopedia 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	'll	find	out	about	barbie	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	to	the	definition	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	,	``	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	``	--	plural	--	``	now	more	 common 	 ly 	 	produce	 ethnic 	 ally 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	 doll 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	black	barbie	.	``	which	is	 vast 	 ly 	 	better	than	what	you	'll	find	in	the	 encyclopedia 	 .com 	 	,	which	is	barbie	,	klaus	.
on	the	other	hand	,	if	they	go	to	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	they	'll	find	a	genuine	article	--	and	i	wo	n't	talk	a	lot	about	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	jimmy	wales	is	here	--	but	 rough 	 ly 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	what	you	would	find	in	the	britannica	,	 different 	 ly 	 	written	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 ies 	 	over	body	image	and	 commercial 	 ization 	 	,	the	 claim 	 s 	 	about	the	way	in	which	she	's	a	good	role	model	,	etc	.
 an 	 other 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	how	content	is	 produce 	 d 	 	,	but	how	relevance	is	 produce 	 d 	 	.
the	claim	to	fame	of	yahoo	!	was	,	we	hire	people	to	look	--	 original 	 ly 	 	,	not	 any 	 more 	 	--	we	hire	people	to	look	at	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	and	tell	you	--	if	they	're	in	the	index	,	they	're	good	.	 th 	 is 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	what	60,000	passionate	 volunteer 	 s 	 	produce	in	the	open	 director 	 y 	 	project	,	each	one	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	an	hour	or	two	on	 some 	 thing 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	,	to	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	good	.	so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	open	 director 	 y 	 	project	,	with	60,000	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	each	one	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	of	time	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	a	few	hundred	fully	paid	 employ 	 ees 	 	.	no	one	 own 	 s 	 	it	,	no	one	 own 	 s 	 	the	 out 	 put 	 	,	it	's	free	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	use	and	it	's	the	 out 	 put 	 	of	people	 act 	 ing 	 	out	of	social	and	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 motiv 	 ations 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	 business 	 es 	 	.	when	you	think	of	what	is	the	critical	 innov 	 ation 	 	of	google	,	the	critical	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	 out 	 sourcing 	 	the	one	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	--	the	decision	about	what	's	relevant	--	to	the	community	of	the	web	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	to	do	:	so	,	page	rank	.
the	critical	 innov 	 ation 	 	here	is	 in 	 stead 	 	of	our	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	or	our	people	 say 	 ing 	 	which	is	the	most	relevant	,	we	're	going	to	go	out	and	count	what	you	,	people	out	there	on	the	web	,	for	 what 	 ever 	 	reason	--	 van 	 ity 	 	,	pleasure	--	 produce 	 d 	 	 link 	 s 	 	,	and	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	each	other	.	we	're	going	to	count	 t 	 hose 	 	,	and	count	them	up	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	here	,	you	see	barbie.com	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	adiosbarbie.com	,	the	body	image	for	every	 s 	 ize 	 	.	a	 contest 	 ed 	 	cultural	object	,	which	you	wo	n't	find	 any 	 where 	 	soon	on	overture	,	which	is	the	classic	market	-	based	 mechan 	 ism 	 	:	 who 	 ever 	 	 pay 	 s 	 	the	most	is	highest	on	the	list	.
so	,	all	of	that	is	in	the	creation	of	content	,	of	relevance	,	 bas 	 ic 	 	human	 express 	 ion 	 	.
but	remember	,	the	 computer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	physical	.	just	physical	 material 	 s 	 	--	our	pcs	--	we	share	them	together	.	we	 al 	 so 	 	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	 wire 	 less 	 	.
it	used	to	be	 wire 	 less 	 	was	one	person	owned	the	 licens 	 e 	 	,	they	 transmit 	 ted 	 	in	an	area	,	and	it	had	to	be	 decide 	 d 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	they	would	be	 licens 	 ed 	 	or	based	on	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	now	is	that	 computer 	 s 	 	and	 radio 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	so	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	that	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	 algorithm 	 s 	 	to	let	people	own	 machine 	 s 	 	,	like	wi	-	fi	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	and	 over 	 lay 	 	them	with	a	sharing	 proto 	 col 	 	that	would	allow	a	community	like	 th 	 is 	 	to	build	 it 	 s 	 	own	 wire 	 less 	 	 broad 	 band 	 	network	 simpl 	 y 	 	from	the	simple	principle	:	when	i	'm	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	when	i	'm	not	using	,	i	can	help	you	transfer	your	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	;	and	when	you	're	not	using	,	you	'll	help	me	transfer	 your 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	 ideal 	 ized 	 	version	.	these	are	 work 	 ing 	 	 model 	 s 	 	that	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	some	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 implement 	 ed 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	public	security	.
if	in	1999	i	told	you	,	let	's	build	a	data	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	and	 retr 	 ieval 	 	system	.
it	's	got	to	store	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	.	it	's	got	to	be	 avail 	 able 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	,	seven	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	.	it	's	got	to	be	 avail 	 able 	 	from	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	support	over	100	million	 user 	 s 	 	at	any	 give 	 n 	 	moment	.	it	's	got	to	be	 ro 	 bust 	 	to	attack	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	main	index	,	 inject 	 ing 	 	 m 	 alicious 	 	 file 	 s 	 	,	 arm 	 ed 	 	seizure	of	some	major	 nod 	 es 	 	.	you	'd	say	that	would	take	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	would	take	 million 	 s 	 	.	but	of	course	,	what	i	'm	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	is	p	2p	file	sharing	.
right	?	we	 al 	 ways 	 	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 steal 	 ing 	 	music	,	but	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	 distribut 	 ed 	 	data	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	and	 retr 	 ieval 	 	system	,	where	people	,	for	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	 reason 	 s 	 	,	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	share	 the 	 ir 	 	 band 	 width 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	the	emergence	of	a	fourth	 trans 	 action 	 al 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	.	it	used	to	be	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 prim 	 ary 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	which	you	could	divide	 thing 	 s 	 	.	they	could	be	market	based	,	or	non	-	market	based	;	they	could	be	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	,	or	 central 	 ized 	 	.
the	price	system	was	a	market	-	based	and	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	system	.
if	 thing 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	better	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 some 	 body 	 	 organ 	 izing 	 	them	,	you	had	 firm 	 s 	 	,	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	the	market	--	or	you	had	 government 	 s 	 	or	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 large 	 r 	 	non	-	 profit 	 s 	 	in	the	non	-	market	.
it	was	too	expensive	to	have	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	social	production	,	to	have	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	action	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	.	that	was	not	about	 socie 	 ty 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
that	was	,	in	fact	,	economic	.
but	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	now	is	the	emergence	of	 th 	 is 	 	fourth	system	of	social	sharing	and	 ex 	 change 	 	.
not	that	it	's	the	first	time	that	we	do	nice	 thing 	 s 	 	to	each	other	,	or	for	each	other	,	 a 	 s 	 	social	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	we	do	it	all	the	time	.
it	's	that	it	's	the	first	time	that	it	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	major	economic	impact	.
what	 character 	 ize 	 s 	 	them	is	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	.
you	do	n't	have	to	ask	 per 	 mission 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	in	a	 proper 	 ty 	 	-	based	system	.
may	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	it	's	open	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	create	and	 innov 	 ate 	 	and	share	,	if	they	want	to	,	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	or	with	 other 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	is	one	 mechan 	 ism 	 	of	 coordi 	 nation 	 	.
but	it	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	what	we	see	are	social	 frame 	 work 	 s 	 	for	all	of	the	critical	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	use	 proper 	 ty 	 	and	contract	in	the	market	:	information	 flow 	 s 	 	to	decide	what	are	 interest 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	;	who	's	 avail 	 able 	 	and	good	for	 some 	 thing 	 	;	 motiv 	 ation 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	--	remember	,	money	is	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	the	best	 motiv 	 ator 	 	.
if	you	 leav 	 e 	 	a	$	50	check	after	 d 	 inner 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	back	.
and	if	 d 	 inner 	 	is	n't	 entire 	 ly 	 	obvious	,	think	of	 s 	 ex 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	certain	new	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	 approach 	 es 	 	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	is	task	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
you	have	to	hire	people	who	know	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
you	have	to	hire	them	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	.
now	,	take	the	same	problem	,	chunk	it	 in 	 to 	 	little	 modul 	 es 	 	,	and	 motiv 	 ations 	 	 be 	 come 	 	trivial	.
five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 watch 	 ing 	 	tv	?
five	 minute 	 s 	 	i	'll	 s 	 pend 	 	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.
just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 give 	 s 	 	me	a	certain	sense	of	meaning	,	or	,	in	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	more	 involve 	 d 	 	,	like	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	 give 	 s 	 	me	a	certain	set	of	social	 relation 	 s 	 	.
so	,	a	new	social	 phenomen 	 on 	 	is	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	.
it	's	creating	,	and	it	's	most	visible	when	we	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	new	form	of	 com 	 petition 	 	.
peer	-	to	-	peer	 network 	 s 	 	 assault 	 ing 	 	the	 record 	 ing 	 	industry	;	free	and	open	source	 soft 	 ware 	 	taking	market	share	from	 micro 	 soft 	 	;	skype	 potential 	 ly 	 	 threaten 	 ing 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	;	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	 on 	 line 	 	 encyclopedia 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	new	source	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	 business 	 es 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	see	a	new	set	of	social	 relation 	 s 	 	and	 behavior 	 s 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	,	you	have	new	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.	some	of	them	are	 tool 	 makers 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	building	well	-	 behav 	 ed 	 	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	know	what	they	'll	do	in	advance	--	you	begin	to	build	more	open	 tool 	 s 	 	.	there	's	a	new	set	of	 value 	 s 	 	,	a	new	set	of	 thing 	 s 	 	people	value	.
you	build	 platform 	 s 	 	for	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	and	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
like	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	like	the	open	 director 	 y 	 	project	,	you	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	build	 platform 	 s 	 	,	and	you	see	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	model	.
and	you	see	 surf 	 ers 	 	,	people	who	see	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	and	in	some	sense	build	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	supply	chain	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	one	.	right	?
you	have	a	belief	:	stuff	will	flow	out	of	 connect 	 ed 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
that	'll	give	me	 some 	 thing 	 	i	can	use	,	and	i	'm	going	to	contract	with	 some 	 one 	 	.
i	will	deliver	 some 	 thing 	 	based	on	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	--	that	's	what	google	 do 	 es 	 	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	.
that	's	what	ibm	 do 	 es 	 	in	 soft 	 ware 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	and	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	 reason 	 ably 	 	well	.
so	,	social	production	is	a	real	fact	,	not	a	fad	.
it	is	the	critical	long	-	term	shift	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
social	 relation 	 s 	 	and	 ex 	 change 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	they	ever	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	economic	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.	in	some	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	,	it	's	even	more	efficient	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	quality	of	the	information	,	the	ability	to	find	the	best	person	,	the	lower	 trans 	 action 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 sustain 	 able 	 	and	growing	fast	.
but	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	dark	lining	--	it	is	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	--	in	the	same	way	that	it	 threaten 	 s 	 	--	the	 in 	 cum 	 bent 	 	industrial	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	next	time	you	open	the	paper	,	and	you	see	an	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	decision	,	a	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	decision	,	it	's	not	about	 some 	 thing 	 	small	and	technical	.
it	is	about	the	future	of	the	 free 	 dom 	 	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	social	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	each	other	,	and	the	way	information	,	knowledge	and	culture	will	be	 produce 	 d 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 text 	 	that	we	see	a	battle	over	how	easy	or	hard	it	will	be	for	the	industrial	information	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	 simpl 	 y 	 	go	on	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	,	or	for	the	new	model	of	production	to	begin	to	develop	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	that	industrial	model	,	and	change	the	way	we	begin	to	see	the	world	and	report	what	it	is	that	we	see	.
thank	you	.
