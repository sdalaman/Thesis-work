so	i	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	was	 plan 	 ned 	 	,	and	the	slogan	was	from	was	to	still	.
and	i	am	 illustr 	 ating 	 	still	.
which	,	of	course	,	i	am	not	 agree 	 ing 	 	with	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	am	94	,	i	am	not	still	 work 	 ing 	 	.
and	 any 	 body 	 	who	 ask 	 s 	 	me	,	``	are	you	still	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	or	that	?	``
i	do	n't	answer	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	still	,	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	it	like	i	 al 	 ways 	 	did	.
i	still	have	--	or	did	i	use	the	word	still	?	i	did	n't	mean	that	.
i	have	my	file	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	to	do	.	i	have	my	 plan 	 s 	 	.
i	have	my	 client 	 s 	 	.	i	am	 do 	 ing 	 	my	work	like	i	 al 	 ways 	 	did	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 take 	 s 	 	care	of	my	age	.
i	want	to	show	you	my	work	so	you	know	what	i	am	 do 	 ing 	 	and	why	i	am	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	about	1925	.
all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	made	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	last	75	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	,	of	course	,	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	since	25	,	 do 	 ing 	 	more	or	less	what	you	see	here	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	castleton	 chin 	 a 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	at	the	museum	of	modern	art	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	now	for	sale	at	the	 metro 	 politan 	 	museum	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	still	at	the	 metro 	 politan 	 	museum	now	for	sale	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	portrait	of	my	daughter	and	 my 	 self 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	just	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	made	.
i	made	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	for	the	last	75	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	call	 my 	 self 	 	a	maker	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	call	 my 	 self 	 	an	industrial	 design 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
industrial	 design 	 ers 	 	want	to	make	novel	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 novel 	 ty 	 	is	a	 con 	 cept 	 	of	commerce	,	not	an	aesthetic	 con 	 cept 	 	.
the	industrial	design	magazine	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 innov 	 ation 	 	.	``
 innov 	 ation 	 	is	not	part	of	the	aim	of	my	work	.
well	,	makers	of	 thing 	 s 	 	:	they	make	 thing 	 s 	 	more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	more	elegant	,	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	than	just	the	 craft 	 s 	 men 	 	do	.
i	have	so	much	to	say	.	i	have	to	think	what	i	am	going	to	say	.
well	,	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	our	profession	 other 	 wise 	 	,	we	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	the	 play 	 ful 	 	search	for	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	the	 play 	 ful 	 	search	for	 beaut 	 y 	 	was	 call 	 ed 	 	the	first	activity	of	man	.
sarah	smith	,	who	was	a	 mathematic 	 s 	 	professor	at	mit	,	wrote	,	``	the	 play 	 ful 	 	search	for	 beaut 	 y 	 	was	man	's	first	activity	--	that	all	 use 	 ful 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	and	all	material	 qual 	 ities 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	from	the	 play 	 ful 	 	search	for	 beaut 	 y 	 	.	``
these	are	 tile 	 s 	 	.	the	word	,	``	 play 	 ful 	 	``	is	a	 necess 	 ary 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	our	work	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	our	 problem 	 s 	 	is	that	we	have	to	make	,	produce	,	 love 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	all	of	life	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	for	me	is	now	75	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	how	can	you	,	 with 	 out 	 	 dry 	 ing 	 	up	,	make	 thing 	 s 	 	with	the	same	pleasure	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	gift	to	 other 	 s 	 	,	for	so	long	?
the	 play 	 ful 	 	is	 there 	 fore 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	our	quality	 a 	 s 	 	 design 	 er 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	some	about	my	life	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	75	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
my	first	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	was	at	the	sesquicentennial	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	in	1926	--	that	the	hungarian	government	 s 	 ent 	 	one	of	my	hand	-	drawn	 piece 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	exhibit	.
my	work	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	me	through	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	 show 	 ed 	 	me	a	great	part	of	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	that	they	took	me	--	the	work	did	n't	take	me	--	i	made	the	 thing 	 s 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	use	them	to	see	the	world	.
i	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	to	see	the	world	,	and	i	made	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	then	 final 	 ly 	 	did	take	me	to	see	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	apprentice	to	a	hungarian	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	taught	me	what	the	guild	system	was	in	middle	 age 	 s 	 	.
the	guild	system	:	that	 mean 	 s 	 	when	i	was	an	apprentice	,	i	had	to	apprentice	 my 	 self 	 	in	order	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 potter 	 y 	 	master	.
in	my	shop	where	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	,	or	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	there	was	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	master	,	 journey 	 man 	 	and	 learn 	 ed 	 	 work 	 er 	 	,	and	apprentice	,	and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	apprentice	.
the	work	 a 	 s 	 	an	apprentice	was	 ver 	 y 	 	primitive	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	i	had	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	learn	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	making	 potter 	 y 	 	by	hand	.
we	 mash 	 ed 	 	the	clay	with	our	feet	when	it	came	from	the	 hill 	 side 	 	.
after	that	,	it	had	to	be	 knead 	 ed 	 	.	it	had	to	then	go	in	,	kind	of	,	a	 man 	 gle 	 	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	it	was	prepared	for	the	 throw 	 ing 	 	.
and	there	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	apprentice	.
my	master	took	me	to	set	 oven 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	part	of	oven	-	making	,	oven	-	setting	,	in	the	time	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	had	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	document	that	i	had	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	my	 apprentice 	 ship 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	,	that	i	had	 behav 	 ed 	 	 moral 	 ly 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	document	was	 give 	 n 	 	to	me	by	the	guild	of	roof	-	coverers	,	rail	-	 dig 	 gers 	 	,	oven	-	setters	,	chimney	 s 	 weep 	 s 	 	and	 potter 	 s 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	got	at	the	time	a	 work 	 book 	 	which	 explain 	 ed 	 	my	 right 	 s 	 	and	my	 work 	 ing 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	and	i	still	have	that	 work 	 book 	 	.
first	i	set	up	a	shop	in	my	own	garden	,	and	made	 potter 	 y 	 	which	i	 s 	 old 	 	on	the	 market 	 place 	 	in	budapest	.
and	there	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	,	and	my	then	-	boyfriend	--	i	did	n't	mean	it	was	a	boyfriend	like	it	is	 me 	 ant 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	but	my	boyfriend	and	i	 s 	 at 	 	at	the	market	and	 s 	 old 	 	the	 pot 	 s 	 	.
my	mother	thought	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	 ver 	 y 	 	proper	,	so	she	 s 	 at 	 	with	us	to	add	 prop 	 riet 	 y 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	activity	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	after	a	while	there	was	a	new	 factor 	 y 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	built	in	budapest	,	a	 potter 	 y 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	,	a	large	one	.
and	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	it	with	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 lad 	 ies 	 	,	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	of	the	director	.
then	the	director	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	why	do	you	ask	all	these	 question 	 s 	 	?
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	 potter 	 y 	 	.
so	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	could	he	 pleas 	 e 	 	visit	me	,	and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	he	did	,	and	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	what	i	did	now	in	my	shop	was	an	 anachron 	 ism 	 	,	that	the	industrial	revolution	had	broken	out	,	and	that	i	 ra 	 ther 	 	should	join	the	 factor 	 y 	 	.
there	he	made	an	art	 depart 	 ment 	 	for	me	where	i	 work 	 ed 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	 factor 	 y 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	his	time	at	the	art	 depart 	 ment 	 	.
the	director	there	 s 	 aid 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	women	 cast 	 ing 	 	and	producing	my	 design 	 s 	 	now	in	 mold 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 s 	 old 	 	 al 	 so 	 	to	america	.
i	remember	that	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	director	,	the	chemist	,	model	maker	--	 every 	 body 	 	--	 concern 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	much	more	with	the	art	 depart 	 ment 	 	--	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	with	my	work	--	than	making	 toilet 	 s 	 	,	so	 final 	 ly 	 	they	got	a	letter	from	the	center	,	from	the	bank	who	owned	the	 factor 	 y 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	make	toilet	-	setting	 be 	 hind 	 	the	art	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	and	that	was	my	end	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	now	i	was	a	 journey 	 man 	 	,	and	 journey 	 men 	 	 al 	 so 	 	take	 the 	 ir 	 	satchel	and	go	to	see	the	world	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	 journey 	 man 	 	,	i	put	an	ad	 in 	 to 	 	the	paper	that	i	had	 stud 	 ied 	 	,	that	i	was	a	down	-	to	-	earth	potter	's	 journey 	 man 	 	and	i	was	looking	for	a	job	 a 	 s 	 	a	 journey 	 man 	 	.
and	i	got	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 answer 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 accept 	 ed 	 	the	one	which	was	 far 	 th 	 est 	 	from	home	and	 practical 	 ly 	 	,	i	thought	,	 half 	 way 	 	to	america	.
and	that	was	in	hamburg	.
then	i	first	took	 th 	 is 	 	job	in	hamburg	,	at	an	art	 potter 	 y 	 	where	 every 	 thing 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	on	the	wheel	,	and	so	i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	a	shop	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 potter 	 s 	 	.
and	the	first	day	,	i	was	coming	to	take	my	place	at	the	 turn 	 table 	 	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	three	or	four	 turn 	 table 	 s 	 	--	and	one	of	them	,	 be 	 hind 	 	where	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	,	was	a	 hunch 	 back 	 	,	a	deaf	-	mute	 hunch 	 back 	 	,	who	 smell 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	.
so	i	 d 	 ous 	 ed 	 	him	in	cologne	every	day	,	which	he	thought	was	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	he	 br 	 ought 	 	bread	and	butter	every	day	,	which	i	had	to	eat	out	of	 court 	 es 	 y 	 	.
the	first	day	i	came	to	work	in	 th 	 is 	 	shop	there	was	on	my	wheel	a	surprise	for	me	.
my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	had	 thought 	 fully 	 	put	on	the	wheel	where	i	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	work	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	 model 	 ed 	 	natural	man	's	 organ 	 s 	 	.
after	i	 brush 	 ed 	 	them	off	with	a	hand	motion	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	--	i	 final 	 ly 	 	was	now	 accept 	 ed 	 	,	and	 work 	 ed 	 	there	for	some	six	 month 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	my	first	job	.
if	i	go	on	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	will	be	here	till	 mid 	 night 	 	.
so	i	will	try	speed	it	up	a	little	 mode 	 rator 	 	:	eva	,	we	have	about	five	 minute 	 s 	 	.
eva	zeisel	:	are	you	 s 	 ure 	 	?
 mode 	 rator 	 	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	am	 s 	 ure 	 	.
ez	:	well	,	if	you	are	 s 	 ure 	 	,	i	have	to	tell	you	that	 with 	 in 	 	five	 minute 	 s 	 	i	will	talk	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	my	work	took	me	to	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	used	my	work	to	fill	my	curiosity	.
and	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	other	 count 	 ries 	 	i	 work 	 ed 	 	,	was	in	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	,	where	i	 work 	 ed 	 	from	'32	to	'37	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	'36	.
i	was	 final 	 ly 	 	there	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	--	i	was	a	foreign	expert	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	art	director	of	the	 chin 	 a 	 	and	glass	industry	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	under	stalin	's	 pur 	 ge 	 s 	 	--	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	stalin	's	 pur 	 ge 	 s 	 	,	i	did	n't	know	that	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 innoc 	 ent 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	 arrest 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	was	 arrest 	 ed 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	early	in	stalin	's	 pur 	 ge 	 s 	 	,	and	 s 	 pent 	 	16	 month 	 s 	 	in	a	russian	 pri 	 son 	 	.
the	 accus 	 ation 	 	was	that	i	had	 success 	 fully 	 	prepared	an	attentat	on	stalin	's	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 accus 	 ation 	 	.
and	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	end	of	my	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	want	to	tell	you	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	which	was	a	surprise	.
but	since	i	 surviv 	 ed 	 	and	i	'm	here	,	and	since	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	end	of	the	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	will	--	 mode 	 rator 	 	:	tell	me	when	your	last	trip	to	russia	was	.
 we 	 re 	 	n't	you	there	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	?
