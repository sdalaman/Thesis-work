i	'm	going	to	talk	about	some	of	my	 discover 	 ies 	 	around	the	world	through	my	work	.
these	are	not	 discover 	 ies 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	or	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	or	science	.
they	're	 discover 	 ies 	 	of	people	and	the	way	people	are	,	and	new	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	benki	.
benki	is	a	 lead 	 er 	 	of	the	ashaninka	nation	.
his	people	live	in	brazil	and	in	peru	.
benki	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	village	so	remote	up	in	the	amazon	that	to	get	there	,	either	you	have	to	fly	and	land	on	water	,	or	go	by	canoe	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.
i	met	benki	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	sao	paulo	when	i	'd	 br 	 ought 	 	him	and	other	 lead 	 ers 	 	from	 indi 	 genous 	 	 people 	 s 	 	to	meet	with	me	and	 lead 	 ers 	 	from	around	the	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	learn	from	each	other	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	our	 st 	 ories 	 	with	each	other	.
the	ashaninka	people	are	known	 through 	 out 	 	south	america	for	 the 	 ir 	 	dignity	,	 the 	 ir 	 	spirit	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	the	incas	and	 continu 	 ing 	 	through	the	19th	century	with	the	rubber	 ta 	 ppers 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	's	 big 	 gest 	 	threat	to	the	ashaninka	people	and	to	benki	 come 	 s 	 	from	 il 	 legal 	 	logging	--	the	people	who	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	forest	and	cut	down	ancient	 ma 	 hog 	 any 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	float	them	down	the	river	to	world	 market 	 s 	 	.
benki	 k 	 new 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
he	could	see	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	his	forest	,	to	his	environment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	taken	under	his	 grand 	 father 	 	's	wing	when	he	was	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	old	to	begin	to	learn	about	the	forest	and	the	way	of	life	of	his	people	.
his	 grand 	 father 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	when	he	was	 on 	 ly 	 	10	.
and	at	that	young	age	,	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	benki	 be 	 came 	 	the	paje	of	his	community	.
now	,	in	the	ashaninka	tradition	and	culture	,	the	paje	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	person	in	the	community	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	person	who	 contain 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	him	all	the	knowledge	,	all	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	centuries	and	centuries	of	life	,	and	not	just	about	his	people	,	but	about	 every 	 thing 	 	that	his	people	's	 surviv 	 al 	 	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	:	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	the	 bird 	 s 	 	,	the	water	,	the	 s 	 oil 	 	,	the	forest	.
so	when	he	was	 on 	 ly 	 	10	and	he	 be 	 came 	 	the	paje	,	he	 beg 	 an 	 	to	lead	his	people	.
he	 beg 	 an 	 	to	talk	to	them	about	the	forest	that	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	protect	,	the	way	of	life	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	nurture	.
he	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	them	that	it	was	not	a	question	of	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	the	 fit 	 test 	 	;	it	was	a	question	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	and	to	protect	that	.
eight	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	he	was	a	young	man	of	18	,	benki	left	the	forest	for	the	first	time	.
he	went	3,000	 mile 	 s 	 	on	an	odyssey	to	rio	to	the	earth	 summ 	 it 	 	to	tell	the	world	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	his	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	corner	.
and	he	went	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 hop 	 ed 	 	the	world	would	listen	.
some	did	,	not	 every 	 body 	 	.
but	if	you	can	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	young	man	with	his	 head 	 dress 	 	and	his	 flow 	 ing 	 	robe	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	new	language	,	portuguese	,	not	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	english	,	going	to	rio	,	building	a	bridge	to	reach	out	to	people	he	'd	never	met	before	--	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	world	.
but	he	was	n't	 dis 	 may 	 ed 	 	.
benki	came	back	to	his	village	full	of	 idea 	 s 	 	--	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	new	research	,	new	ways	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	was	going	on	.
since	that	time	,	he	's	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	work	with	his	people	,	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	ashaninka	nation	,	but	all	the	 people 	 s 	 	of	the	amazon	and	beyond	.
he	's	built	 school 	 s 	 	to	teach	children	to	care	for	the	forest	.
together	,	he	's	led	the	 re 	 forest 	 ation 	 	of	over	25	percent	of	the	land	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	the	loggers	.
he	's	 create 	 d 	 	a	 co 	 operative 	 	to	help	people	 divers 	 ify 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 livelihood 	 s 	 	.
and	he	's	 br 	 ought 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	satellite	technology	to	the	forest	--	both	so	that	people	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	could	monitor	the	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	that	he	could	speak	from	the	forest	to	the	rest	of	the	world	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	meet	benki	and	ask	him	,	``	why	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
why	are	you	 put 	 ting 	 	 your 	 self 	 	at	risk	?
why	are	you	making	 your 	 self 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	what	is	often	a	 hostil 	 e 	 	world	?	``
he	would	tell	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	told	me	,	``	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	did	my	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	and	my	great	-	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	do	to	protect	the	forest	for	me	?
and	what	am	i	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
so	when	i	think	of	that	,	i	wonder	what	our	 grand 	 children 	 	and	our	great	-	 grand 	 children 	 	,	when	they	ask	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	question	,	i	wonder	how	they	will	answer	.
for	me	,	the	world	is	 veer 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	future	we	do	n't	much	want	when	we	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	it	deep	 in 	 side 	 	.
it	's	a	future	we	do	n't	know	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	,	but	it	's	a	future	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 sign 	 s 	 	,	just	like	benki	saw	the	 sign 	 s 	 	around	him	.
we	know	we	are	running	out	of	what	we	need	.
we	're	running	out	of	fresh	water	.
we	're	running	out	of	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
we	're	running	out	of	land	.
we	know	climate	change	is	going	to	affect	all	of	us	.
we	do	n't	know	how	,	but	we	know	it	will	.
and	we	know	that	there	will	be	more	of	us	than	ever	before	--	five	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	40	 year 	 s 	 	than	60	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	are	running	out	of	what	we	need	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	in	other	ways	,	that	since	1960	there	are	one	-	third	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	new	 count 	 ries 	 	that	exist	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	 ent 	 ities 	 	on	the	planet	.
 ego 	 s 	 	,	 system 	 s 	 	of	government	--	 figur 	 ing 	 	it	out	--	massive	change	.
and	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	,	we	know	that	five	other	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 count 	 ries 	 	are	going	to	have	a	say	in	the	future	,	a	say	we	have	n't	even	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	hear	yet	--	 chin 	 a 	 	,	india	,	russia	,	south	africa	and	benki	's	own	brazil	,	where	benki	got	his	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	1988	 constit 	 ution 	 	.
but	you	know	all	that	.
you	know	more	than	benki	 k 	 new 	 	when	he	left	his	forest	and	went	3,000	 mile 	 s 	 	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	we	ca	n't	just	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	what	we	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	'll	get	the	 result 	 s 	 	we	've	 al 	 ways 	 	gotten	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	 some 	 thing 	 	i	understand	lord	salisbury	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 que 	 en 	 	victoria	over	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	she	was	 press 	 ing 	 	him	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	change	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	change	?
why	change	?
 thing 	 s 	 	are	bad	 en 	 ough 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	.	``
we	have	to	change	.
it	's	 imper 	 ative 	 	to	me	,	when	i	look	around	the	world	,	that	we	need	to	change	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	need	new	 model 	 s 	 	of	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 lead 	 er 	 	.
we	need	new	 model 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	and	a	human	in	the	world	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	life	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bank 	 er 	 	.
now	i	do	n't	admit	to	that	to	 any 	 body 	 	but	my	 ver 	 y 	 	close	 friend 	 s 	 	.
but	for	the	past	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
my	work	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	me	around	the	world	,	where	i	've	had	the	real	privilege	of	 meet 	 ing 	 	people	like	benki	and	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	who	are	making	change	happen	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	--	people	who	see	the	world	 different 	 ly 	 	,	who	are	 ask 	 ing 	 	different	 question 	 s 	 	,	who	have	different	 answer 	 s 	 	,	who	understand	the	 filter 	 s 	 	that	they	wear	when	they	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	sanghamitra	.
sanghamitra	 come 	 s 	 	from	bangalore	.
i	met	sanghamitra	eight	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	i	was	in	bangalore	 organ 	 izing 	 	a	 work 	 shop 	 	with	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	different	ngo	's	 work 	 ing 	 	in	some	of	the	 hard 	 est 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
sanghamitra	did	n't	start	life	 a 	 s 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	of	an	ngo	,	she	 start 	 ed 	 	her	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	university	professor	,	 teach 	 ing 	 	english	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
but	she	 real 	 ized 	 	that	she	was	much	too	 detach 	 ed 	 	from	the	world	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
she	 love 	 d 	 	it	,	but	she	was	too	 detach 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	in	1993	,	a	long	time	ago	,	she	 decide 	 d 	 	to	start	a	new	 organ 	 ization 	 	focused	on	one	of	the	 hard 	 est 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	one	of	the	 hard 	 est 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	in	india	--	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	at	the	time	--	since	that	time	,	samraksha	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	from	strength	to	strength	and	is	now	one	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	health	ngo	's	in	india	.
but	if	you	just	think	about	the	state	of	the	world	and	knowledge	of	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	in	1993	--	in	india	at	that	time	it	was	 skyrocket 	 ing 	 	and	 no 	 body 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	why	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	there	are	still	three	million	hiv	-	positive	people	in	india	.
that	's	the	second	largest	population	in	the	world	.
when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	sanghamitra	,	``	how	did	you	get	from	english	 liter 	 ature 	 	to	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	?	``
not	an	obvious	path	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	it	's	all	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
 liter 	 ature 	 	 make 	 s 	 	one	sensitive	,	sensitive	to	people	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	and	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.	``
since	that	time	,	under	her	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	samraksha	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	pioneer	in	all	 field 	 s 	 	related	to	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.
they	have	 re 	 spite 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,	the	first	,	the	first	care	 center 	 s 	 	,	the	first	 counsel 	 ing 	 	 service 	 s 	 	--	and	not	just	in	urban	,	7	-	million	-	population	bangalore	,	but	in	the	 hard 	 est 	 	to	reach	 village 	 s 	 	in	the	state	of	karnataka	.
even	that	was	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	.
she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	change	policy	at	the	government	level	.
10	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 program 	 s 	 	that	she	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	are	now	government	policy	and	funded	by	the	government	.
they	take	care	of	20,000	-	odd	people	 to 	 day 	 	in	over	1,000	 village 	 s 	 	around	karnataka	.
she	 work 	 s 	 	with	people	like	murali	krishna	.
murali	krishna	 come 	 s 	 	from	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 village 	 s 	 	.
he	lost	his	wife	to	 aid 	 s 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	he	's	hiv	-	positive	.
but	he	saw	the	work	,	the	care	,	the	 compass 	 ion 	 	that	sanghamitra	and	her	team	 br 	 ought 	 	to	the	village	,	and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	part	of	it	.
he	's	a	 lead 	 ers 	 	'	quest	fellow	,	and	that	 help 	 s 	 	him	with	his	work	.
they	've	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	a	different	approach	to	 village 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hand 	 ing 	 	out	information	in	 pamphlet 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	is	so	often	the	case	,	they	 br 	 ing 	 	theater	 trou 	 pe 	 s 	 	,	 song 	 s 	 	,	music	,	dance	.
and	they	 s 	 it 	 	around	,	and	they	talk	about	 dream 	 s 	 	.
sanghamitra	told	me	just	last	week	--	she	had	just	come	back	from	two	 week 	 s 	 	in	the	 village 	 s 	 	,	and	she	had	a	real	 break 	 through 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	circle	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 dream 	 s 	 	for	the	village	.
and	the	young	women	in	the	village	spoke	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	've	 change 	 d 	 	our	dream	.
our	dream	is	for	our	 partner 	 s 	 	,	our	 husband 	 s 	 	,	not	to	be	 give 	 n 	 	to	us	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	 hor 	 o 	 scope 	 	,	but	to	be	 give 	 n 	 	to	us	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	tested	for	hiv	.	``
if	you	are	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	meet	sanghamitra	and	ask	her	why	and	how	,	how	have	you	 achiev 	 ed 	 	so	much	?
she	would	look	at	you	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 quiet 	 ly 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 soft 	 ly 	 	say	,	``	it	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	.

he	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	soldier	,	a	teacher	,	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	,	a	vice	-	mayor	and	a	business	man	.

he	would	tell	you	,	``	i	'm	a	 collect 	 or 	 	,	and	i	 cur 	 ate 	 	a	museum	.	``

now	,	just	think	of	the	early	1960	's	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
over	a	 life 	 time 	 	,	through	 every 	 thing 	 	,	through	the	cultural	revolution	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 after 	 ward 	 	,	he	's	 ke 	 pt 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	,	so	that	he	now	 ha 	 s 	 	over	eight	million	 piece 	 s 	 	in	his	 museum 	 s 	 	 document 	 ing 	 	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	chinese	 histo 	 ry 	 	.

for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	he	's	got	over	one	million	 piece 	 s 	 	 document 	 ing 	 	the	sino	-	japanese	war	,	a	war	that	's	not	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	in	 chin 	 a 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	and	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	heroes	are	not	 honor 	 ed 	 	.
why	did	he	do	all	 th 	 is 	 	?

they	did	n't	read	a	manual	,	``	how	to	be	a	good	 lead 	 er 	 	in	10	easy	 step 	 s 	 	.	``
but	they	have	 qual 	 ities 	 	we	'd	all	 recogn 	 ize 	 	.
they	have	drive	,	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	 commit 	 ment 	 	.
they	've	gone	away	from	what	they	did	before	,	and	they	've	gone	to	 some 	 thing 	 	they	did	n't	know	.
they	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	connect	 world 	 s 	 	they	did	n't	know	 exist 	 ed 	 	before	.
they	've	built	 bridge 	 s 	 	,	and	they	've	 walk 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	them	.
they	have	a	sense	of	the	great	arc	of	time	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	place	in	it	.
they	know	people	have	come	before	them	and	will	follow	them	.
and	they	know	that	they	're	part	of	a	whole	,	that	they	depend	on	other	people	.
it	's	not	about	them	,	they	know	that	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	start	with	them	.
and	they	have	 humil 	 ity 	 	.
it	just	 happen 	 s 	 	.
but	we	know	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	happen	,	do	n't	we	?
we	know	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	make	it	happen	,	and	we	know	the	direction	the	world	is	going	in	.
so	i	think	we	need	 success 	 ion 	 	 plan 	 ning 	 	on	a	global	 bas 	 is 	 	.
we	ca	n't	wait	for	the	next	generation	,	the	new	 join 	 ers 	 	,	to	come	in	and	learn	how	to	be	the	good	 lead 	 ers 	 	we	need	.
i	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	start	with	us	.
and	we	know	,	just	like	they	 k 	 new 	 	,	how	hard	it	is	.
but	the	good	news	is	that	we	do	n't	have	to	figure	it	out	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	 a 	 long 	 	;	we	have	 model 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	like	benki	and	sanghamitra	and	jianchuan	.
we	can	look	at	what	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	if	we	look	.
we	can	learn	from	what	they	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
we	can	change	the	way	we	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	world	.
and	if	we	're	 luck 	 y 	 	,	we	can	change	the	way	our	great	-	 grand 	 children 	 	will	answer	benki	's	question	.
thank	you	.
