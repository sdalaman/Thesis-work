i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night	with	the	sound	of	heavy	explosion	.
it	was	deep	at	night	.
i	do	not	remember	what	time	it	was	.
i	just	remember	the	sound	was	so	heavy	and	so	 ver 	 y 	 	 shock 	 ing 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	in	my	room	was	 sha 	 king 	 	--	my	heart	,	my	 window 	 s 	 	,	my	bed	,	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	out	the	 window 	 s 	 	and	i	saw	a	full	half	-	circle	of	explosion	.
i	thought	it	was	just	like	the	 movie 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 movie 	 s 	 	had	not	 convey 	 ed 	 	them	in	the	 power 	 ful 	 	image	that	i	was	 see 	 ing 	 	full	of	bright	red	and	 o 	 range 	 	and	gray	,	and	a	full	circle	of	explosion	.
and	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	 star 	 ing 	 	at	it	 un 	 til 	 	it	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
i	went	back	to	my	bed	,	and	i	 pray 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	 secret 	 ly 	 	 thank 	 ed 	 	god	that	that	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	did	not	land	on	my	family	's	home	,	that	it	did	not	kill	my	family	that	night	.
thirty	 year 	 s 	 	have	 pass 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	still	feel	 guilt 	 y 	 	about	that	 pray 	 er 	 	,	for	the	next	day	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	that	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	on	my	brother	's	friend	's	home	and	 kill 	 ed 	 	him	and	his	father	,	but	did	not	kill	his	mother	or	his	sister	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	my	story	.
i	was	that	girl	.
i	am	 an 	 other 	 	image	and	vision	of	 an 	 other 	 	 surviv 	 or 	 	of	war	.
i	am	that	 refuge 	 e 	 	,	and	i	am	that	girl	.
you	see	,	i	grew	up	in	war	-	torn	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	are	two	 side 	 s 	 	of	 war 	 s 	 	and	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 een 	 	one	side	of	it	.
we	 on 	 ly 	 	talk	about	one	side	of	it	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	side	that	i	have	 witness 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	who	lived	in	it	and	 some 	 one 	 	who	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 work 	 ing 	 	in	it	.
i	grew	up	with	the	 color 	 s 	 	of	war	--	the	red	 color 	 s 	 	of	fire	and	blood	,	the	 brow 	 n 	 	 tone 	 s 	 	of	earth	 a 	 s 	 	it	 explode 	 s 	 	in	our	 face 	 s 	 	and	the	 pierc 	 ing 	 	silver	of	an	 explode 	 d 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	,	so	bright	that	 noth 	 ing 	 	can	protect	your	 eye 	 s 	 	from	it	.
i	grew	up	with	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	war	--	the	staccato	 sound 	 s 	 	of	 gun 	 fire 	 	,	the	 wrench 	 ing 	 	 boom 	 s 	 	of	 explosion 	 s 	 	,	ominous	 drone 	 s 	 	of	 jet 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 over 	 head 	 	and	the	 wail 	 ing 	 	 war 	 ning 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	of	 siren 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	 sound 	 s 	 	you	would	expect	,	but	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	 dis 	 son 	 ant 	 	 concert 	 s 	 	of	a	flock	of	 bird 	 s 	 	 screech 	 ing 	 	in	the	night	,	the	high	-	 pitch 	 ed 	 	honest	 cri 	 es 	 	of	children	and	the	 thunder 	 ous 	 	,	 un 	 bear 	 able 	 	silence	.
``	war	,	``	a	friend	of	mine	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	is	not	about	sound	at	all	.
it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	silence	,	the	silence	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.	``
i	have	since	left	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	 found 	 ed 	 	a	group	 call 	 ed 	 	women	for	women	 inter 	 national 	 	that	 end 	 s 	 	up	 work 	 ing 	 	with	women	 surviv 	 ors 	 	of	 war 	 s 	 	.
in	my	 travel 	 s 	 	and	in	my	work	,	from	congo	to	afghanistan	,	from	sudan	to	rwanda	,	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	the	 color 	 s 	 	and	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	war	are	the	same	,	but	the	 fear 	 s 	 	of	war	are	the	same	.
you	know	,	there	is	a	fear	of	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	and	do	not	 believ 	 e 	 	any	movie	character	where	the	hero	is	not	 af 	 raid 	 	.
it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	to	go	through	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	``	i	am	about	to	die	``	or	``	i	could	die	in	 th 	 is 	 	explosion	.	``
but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	fear	of	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	that	's	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
it	's	too	 pain 	 ful 	 	.	you	do	n't	want	to	think	about	it	.
but	i	think	the	worst	kind	of	fear	is	the	fear	--	 a 	 s 	 	samia	,	a	bosnian	woman	,	once	told	me	,	who	 surviv 	 ed 	 	the	four	-	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 siege 	 	of	sarajevo	;	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	fear	of	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	'	i	'	in	me	,	the	fear	of	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	'	i	'	in	me	.	``
that	's	what	my	mother	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	used	to	tell	me	.
it	's	like	 dy 	 ing 	 	from	 in 	 side 	 	-	out	.
