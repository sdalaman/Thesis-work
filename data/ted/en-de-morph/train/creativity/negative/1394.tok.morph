i	'm	a	 believ 	 er 	 	.
i	'm	a	 believ 	 er 	 	in	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	and	my	record	is	good	on	the	subject	.
but	my	subject	is	national	security	.
we	have	to	get	off	of	oil	 purchase 	 d 	 	from	the	 ene 	 my 	 	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	opec	oil	.
and	let	me	take	you	back	100	 year 	 s 	 	to	1912	.
you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	that	was	my	birth	year	.
it	was	n't	.	it	was	1928	.
but	go	back	to	1912	,	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	look	at	that	point	what	we	,	our	country	,	was	 face 	 d 	 	with	.
it	's	the	same	energy	question	that	you	're	looking	at	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	it	's	different	 source 	 s 	 	of	fuel	.
a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	coal	,	of	course	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	whale	oil	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	.
at	that	point	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	a	fuel	that	was	 clean 	 er 	 	,	it	was	 cheap 	 er 	 	,	and	it	was	n't	 our 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	it	was	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	.
so	at	that	point	,	1912	,	we	 select 	 ed 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	over	whale	oil	and	some	more	coal	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	we	 move 	 d 	 	on	to	the	period	now	,	100	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	're	back	 re 	 ally 	 	at	 an 	 other 	 	decision	point	.
what	is	the	decision	point	?
it	's	what	we	're	going	to	use	in	the	future	.
so	from	here	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	clear	to	me	,	we	would	prefer	to	have	 clean 	 er 	 	,	 cheap 	 er 	 	,	and	we	have	that	,	we	have	that	--	which	is	natural	gas	.
so	here	you	are	,	that	the	cost	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	world	is	89	million	 barrel 	 s 	 	of	oil	,	give	or	take	a	few	 barrel 	 s 	 	,	every	day	.
and	the	cost	 annual 	 ly 	 	is	three	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	one	trillion	of	that	 go 	 es 	 	to	opec	.
that	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	 stop 	 ped 	 	.
now	if	you	look	at	the	cost	of	opec	,	it	cost	seven	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	on	the	milken	institute	 stud 	 y 	 	last	year	--	seven	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	since	1976	,	is	what	we	paid	for	oil	from	opec	.
now	that	 include 	 s 	 	the	cost	of	 militar 	 y 	 	and	the	cost	of	the	fuel	both	.
but	it	's	the	 great 	 est 	 	transfer	of	wealth	,	from	one	group	to	 an 	 other 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 man 	 kind 	 	.
and	it	 continu 	 es 	 	.
now	when	you	look	at	where	is	the	transfer	of	wealth	,	you	can	see	here	that	we	have	the	 arrow 	 s 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	mid	-	east	and	away	from	us	.
and	with	that	,	we	have	found	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	be	the	world	's	 police 	 men 	 	.
we	are	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	and	how	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?
i	know	the	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	would	bet	there	are	n't	10	percent	of	you	in	the	room	that	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	 air 	 craft 	 	 car 	 rier 	 s 	 	there	are	in	the	world	.
raise	your	hand	if	you	think	you	know	.
there	are	12	.
one	is	under	construction	by	the	chinese	and	the	other	11	belong	to	us	.
why	do	we	have	11	 air 	 craft 	 	 car 	 rier 	 s 	 	?
do	we	have	a	corner	on	the	market	?
are	we	 smart 	 er 	 	than	 any 	 body 	 	else	?	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	.
if	you	look	at	where	they	're	 locate 	 d 	 	--	and	on	 th 	 is 	 	slide	it	's	the	red	 blob 	 s 	 	on	there	--	there	are	five	that	are	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	the	mid	-	east	,	and	the	rest	of	them	are	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
they	just	move	back	to	the	mid	-	east	and	 t 	 hose 	 	come	back	.
so	 actual 	 ly 	 	most	of	the	11	we	have	are	 ti 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	mid	-	east	.
why	?	why	are	they	in	the	mid	-	east	?
they	're	there	to	control	,	keep	the	 ship 	 ping 	 	 lane 	 s 	 	open	and	make	oil	 avail 	 able 	 	.
and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	uses	about	20	million	 barrel 	 s 	 	a	day	,	which	is	about	25	percent	of	all	the	oil	used	 every 	 day 	 	in	the	world	.
and	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	with	four	percent	of	the	population	.
 some 	 how 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	right	.
that	's	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
so	where	do	we	go	from	here	?
 do 	 es 	 	that	 continu 	 e 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	.
the	slide	you	're	looking	at	here	is	1990	to	2040	.
over	that	period	you	are	going	to	double	your	demand	.
and	when	you	look	at	what	we	're	using	the	oil	for	,	70	percent	of	it	is	used	for	 transport 	 ation 	 	fuel	.
so	when	 some 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	let	's	go	more	nuclear	,	let	's	go	wind	,	let	's	go	solar	,	``	fine	;	i	'm	for	 any 	 thing 	 	american	,	 any 	 thing 	 	american	.
but	if	you	're	going	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	 depend 	 ency 	 	on	foreign	oil	,	you	have	to	address	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
so	here	we	are	using	20	million	 barrel 	 s 	 	a	day	--	producing	eight	,	 import 	 ing 	 	12	,	and	from	the	12	,	five	 come 	 s 	 	from	opec	.
when	you	look	at	the	 big 	 gest 	 	user	and	the	second	largest	user	,	we	use	20	million	 barrel 	 s 	 	and	the	chinese	use	10	.
the	chinese	have	a	little	bit	better	plan	--	or	they	have	a	plan	;	we	have	no	plan	.
in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	america	,	we	've	never	had	an	energy	plan	.
we	do	n't	even	 real 	 ize 	 	the	 resource 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 avail 	 able 	 	to	us	.
if	you	take	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	forward	,	you	've	 transfer 	 red 	 	to	opec	a	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
if	you	go	forward	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	and	cap	the	price	of	oil	at	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	barrel	,	you	will	pay	2.2	trillion	.
that	's	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	either	.
but	the	 day 	 s 	 	of	cheap	oil	are	over	.
they	're	over	.
they	make	it	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	to	you	,	the	saudis	do	,	they	have	to	have	94	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	barrel	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	social	 commit 	 ments 	 	.
now	i	had	people	in	washington	last	week	told	me	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	saudis	can	produce	the	oil	for	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	barrel	.
that	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	it	.
it	's	what	they	have	to	pay	for	is	what	we	are	going	to	pay	for	oil	.	``
there	is	no	free	market	for	oil	.
the	oil	is	priced	off	the	margin	.
and	the	opec	 nation 	 s 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	price	the	oil	.
so	where	are	we	headed	from	here	?
we	're	headed	to	natural	gas	.
natural	gas	will	do	 every 	 thing 	 	we	want	it	to	do	.
it	's	130	octane	fuel	.
it	's	25	percent	 clean 	 er 	 	than	oil	.
it	's	 our 	 s 	 	,	we	have	an	abundance	of	it	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	 requir 	 e 	 	a	 refine 	 ry 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	ground	at	130	octane	.
run	it	through	the	separator	and	you	're	ready	to	use	it	.
it	's	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	for	us	to	use	.
it	's	going	to	be	simple	to	accomplish	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	're	going	to	find	,	and	i	'll	tell	you	in	just	a	minute	,	what	you	're	looking	for	to	make	it	happen	.
but	here	you	can	look	at	the	list	.
natural	gas	will	fit	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
it	will	replace	or	be	able	to	be	used	for	that	.
it	's	for	power	generation	,	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	it	's	peaking	fuel	,	it	's	all	 t 	 hose 	 	.
do	we	have	 en 	 ough 	 	natural	gas	?
look	at	the	bar	on	the	left	.	it	's	24	trillion	.
it	's	what	we	use	a	year	.
go	forward	and	the	 estimate 	 s 	 	that	you	have	from	the	eia	and	onto	the	industry	 estimate 	 s 	 	--	the	industry	 know 	 s 	 	what	they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	we	've	got	4,000	trillion	cubic	feet	of	natural	gas	that	's	 avail 	 able 	 	to	us	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	that	 transl 	 ate 	 	to	 barrel 	 s 	 	of	oil	 equi 	 valent 	 	?
it	would	be	three	 time 	 s 	 	what	the	saudis	claim	they	have	.
and	they	claim	they	have	250	billion	 barrel 	 s 	 	of	oil	,	which	i	do	not	 believ 	 e 	 	.
i	think	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	175	billion	 barrel 	 s 	 	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	say	they	're	right	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	we	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	natural	gas	.
so	i	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	target	on	where	we	use	the	natural	gas	.
and	where	i	've	 target 	 ed 	 	is	on	the	heavy	-	duty	 truck 	 s 	 	.
there	are	eight	million	of	them	.
you	take	eight	million	 truck 	 s 	 	--	these	are	18	-	wheelers	--	and	take	them	to	natural	gas	,	 reduc 	 e 	 	carbon	by	30	percent	,	it	is	 cheap 	 er 	 	and	it	will	cut	our	 import 	 s 	 	three	million	 barrel 	 s 	 	.
so	you	will	cut	60	percent	off	of	opec	with	eight	million	 truck 	 s 	 	.
there	are	250	million	 vehicle 	 s 	 	in	america	.
so	what	you	have	is	natural	gas	is	the	bridge	fuel	,	is	the	way	i	see	it	.
i	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	the	bridge	to	where	at	my	age	.
that	's	your	concern	.
but	when	you	look	at	the	natural	gas	we	have	it	could	 ver 	 y 	 	well	be	the	bridge	to	natural	gas	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	natural	gas	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	'm	for	 any 	 thing 	 	american	.
now	let	me	take	you	--	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	 re 	 alist 	 	--	i	went	from	 theor 	 ist 	 	early	to	 re 	 alist 	 	.
i	'm	back	to	 theor 	 ist 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	world	,	you	have	 m 	 ethane 	 	hydrates	in	the	ocean	around	every	continent	.
and	here	you	can	see	 m 	 ethane 	 	,	if	that	's	the	way	you	're	going	to	go	,	that	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 m 	 ethane 	 	--	natural	gas	is	 m 	 ethane 	 	,	 m 	 ethane 	 	and	natural	gas	are	 inter 	 change 	 able 	 	--	but	if	you	decide	that	you	're	going	to	use	some	 m 	 ethane 	 	--	and	i	'm	gone	,	so	it	's	up	to	you	--	but	we	do	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 m 	 ethane 	 	hydrates	.
so	i	think	i	've	made	my	point	that	we	have	to	get	on	our	own	 resource 	 s 	 	in	america	.
if	we	do	--	it	's	 cost 	 ing 	 	us	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	for	oil	.
and	yet	,	we	have	no	energy	plan	.
so	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	going	on	that	 impress 	 es 	 	me	in	washington	on	that	plan	,	other	than	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	focus	on	that	eight	million	18	-	wheelers	.
if	we	could	do	that	,	i	think	we	would	take	our	first	step	to	an	energy	plan	.
if	we	did	,	we	could	see	that	our	own	 resource 	 s 	 	are	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	use	than	 any 	 body 	 	can	imagine	.
thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	 thank 	 s 	 	for	that	.
so	from	your	point	of	view	,	you	had	 th 	 is 	 	great	pickens	plan	that	was	based	on	wind	energy	,	and	you	 abandon 	 ed 	 	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 economic 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
tbp	:	i	lost	150	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
that	'll	make	you	abandon	 some 	 thing 	 	.
no	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	us	,	chris	,	is	that	power	,	it	's	priced	off	the	margin	.
and	so	the	margin	is	natural	gas	.
and	at	the	time	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	wind	business	,	natural	gas	was	nine	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	it	's	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	forty	 cent 	 s 	 	.
you	can	not	do	a	wind	deal	under	six	 dollar 	 s 	 	an	mcf	.
ca	:	so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	,	through	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	ability	to	use	 f 	 rack 	 ing 	 	technology	,	the	 calcul 	 ated 	 	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	of	natural	gas	kind	of	 explode 	 d 	 	and	the	price	 plummet 	 ed 	 	,	which	made	wind	uncompetitive	.
in	a	 nut 	 shell 	 	that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
tbp	:	that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
we	found	out	that	we	could	go	to	the	source	rock	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	the	carboniferous	shales	in	the	 basin 	 s 	 	.
the	first	one	was	barnett	 sha 	 le 	 	in	texas	and	then	the	marcellus	up	in	the	 north 	 east 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	new	york	,	pennsylvania	,	west	virginia	;	and	haynesville	in	louisiana	.
 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	 every 	 where 	 	.
we	are	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	with	natural	gas	.
ca	:	and	now	you	're	a	big	 invest 	 or 	 	in	that	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	that	to	market	?
tbp	:	well	you	say	a	big	 invest 	 or 	 	.
it	's	my	life	.
i	'm	a	 geo 	 logist 	 	,	got	out	of	school	in	'51	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	industry	my	entire	life	.
now	i	do	own	 stock 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	a	big	natural	gas	 produce 	 r 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	the	other	day	 s 	 aid 	 	i	was	the	second	largest	natural	gas	 produce 	 r 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
do	n't	i	wish	.
but	no	,	i	'm	not	.	i	own	 stock 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	am	in	the	 fuel 	 ing 	 	business	.
ca	:	but	natural	gas	is	a	fossil	fuel	.
you	burn	it	,	you	 re 	 lease 	 	co	2	.
so	you	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	threat	of	climate	change	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	n't	that	prospect	concern	you	?
tbp	:	well	you	're	going	to	have	to	use	 some 	 thing 	 	.
what	do	you	have	to	replace	it	?
ca	:	no	,	no	.	the	argument	that	it	's	a	bridge	fuel	 make 	 s 	 	sense	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	amount	of	co	2	per	unit	of	energy	is	lower	than	oil	and	coal	,	correct	?
and	so	 every 	 one 	 	can	be	at	 l 	 east 	 	happy	to	see	a	shift	from	coal	or	oil	to	natural	gas	.
but	if	that	's	it	and	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	reason	that	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	do	n't	get	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	,	then	,	long	-	term	,	we	're	 screw 	 ed 	 	 any 	 way 	 	,	right	?
tbp	:	well	i	'm	not	ready	to	give	up	,	but	jim	and	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	there	 a 	 s 	 	he	left	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	do	you	feel	about	natural	gas	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	it	's	a	bridge	fuel	,	is	what	it	is	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	bridge	to	what	?
where	are	we	headed	?	``
see	but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	told	you	,	i	do	n't	have	to	worry	with	that	.
you	all	do	.
ca	:	but	i	do	n't	think	that	's	right	,	boone	.
i	think	you	're	a	person	who	 believ 	 es 	 	in	your	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
you	've	made	the	money	you	need	.
you	're	one	of	the	few	people	in	a	position	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 wing 	 	the	debate	.
do	you	support	the	idea	of	some	kind	of	price	on	carbon	?
 do 	 es 	 	that	make	sense	?
tbp	:	i	do	n't	like	that	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 end 	 s 	 	up	the	government	is	going	to	run	the	program	.
i	can	tell	you	it	will	be	a	failure	.
the	government	is	not	 success 	 ful 	 	on	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	just	are	n't	,	it	's	a	bad	deal	.
look	at	solyndra	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	was	.
i	mean	,	that	was	told	to	be	a	bad	idea	10	 time 	 s 	 	,	they	went	 a 	 head 	 	and	did	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
but	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 ble 	 w 	 	out	500	million	.
i	think	it	's	 close 	 r 	 	to	a	billion	.
but	chris	,	i	think	where	we	're	headed	,	the	long	-	term	,	i	do	n't	mind	going	back	to	nuclear	.
and	i	can	tell	you	what	the	last	page	of	the	report	that	will	take	them	five	 year 	 s 	 	to	write	will	be	.
one	,	do	n't	build	a	 reform 	 er 	 	on	a	fault	.
and	number	two	,	do	not	build	a	 reform 	 er 	 	on	the	ocean	.
and	now	i	think	 reform 	 ers 	 	are	safe	.
move	them	 in 	 land 	 	and	on	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 table 	 	ground	and	build	the	 reform 	 ers 	 	.
there	is	n't	 any 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	nuke	.
you	're	going	to	have	to	have	energy	.	there	is	no	question	.
you	ca	n't	--	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
ca	:	one	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	from	the	audience	is	,	with	 f 	 rack 	 ing 	 	and	the	natural	gas	process	,	what	about	the	problem	of	 m 	 ethane 	 	 leak 	 ing 	 	from	that	,	 m 	 ethane 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 wo 	 rse 	 	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	gas	than	co	2	?
is	that	a	concern	?
tbp	:	 f 	 rack 	 ing 	 	?	what	is	 f 	 rack 	 ing 	 	?
ca	:	 f 	 rack 	 ing 	 	.
tbp	:	i	'm	 teas 	 ing 	 	.
ca	:	we	've	got	a	little	bit	of	accent	 in 	 com 	 pat 	 ibility 	 	here	,	you	know	.
tbp	:	no	,	let	me	tell	you	,	i	've	told	you	what	my	age	was	.
i	got	out	of	school	in	'51	.
i	 witness 	 ed 	 	my	first	frack	job	at	border	texas	in	1953	.
 f 	 rack 	 ing 	 	came	out	in	'47	,	and	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	for	a	minute	when	our	 p 	 resident 	 	 get 	 s 	 	up	there	and	 say 	 s 	 	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	energy	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 develop 	 ed 	 	 f 	 rack 	 ing 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	what	in	the	hell	he	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
i	mean	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	energy	did	not	have	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	 f 	 rack 	 ing 	 	.
the	first	frack	job	was	in	'47	.
i	saw	my	first	one	in	'53	.
i	've	fracked	over	3,000	 well 	 s 	 	in	my	life	.
never	had	a	problem	with	 mess 	 ing 	 	up	an	aquifer	or	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
now	the	largest	aquifer	in	north	america	is	from	midland	,	texas	to	the	south	dakota	border	,	 a 	 cross 	 	eight	 state 	 s 	 	--	big	aquifer	:	ogallala	,	triassic	age	.
there	had	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	800,000	 well 	 s 	 	fracked	in	oklahoma	,	texas	,	kansas	in	that	aquifer	.
there	's	no	 problem 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	understand	why	the	media	is	focused	on	eastern	pennsylvania	.
ca	:	all	right	,	so	you	do	n't	support	a	carbon	tax	of	any	kind	or	a	price	on	carbon	.
your	picture	then	i	guess	of	how	the	world	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	off	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	is	through	 innov 	 ation 	 	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	that	we	'll	 some 	 day 	 	make	solar	and	nuclear	cost	competitive	?
tbp	:	solar	and	wind	,	jim	and	i	 agree 	 d 	 	on	that	in	13	 second 	 s 	 	.
that	is	,	it	's	going	to	be	a	small	part	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	 re 	 ly 	 	on	it	.
ca	:	so	how	 do 	 es 	 	the	world	get	off	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	?
tbp	:	how	do	we	get	there	?
we	have	so	much	natural	gas	,	a	day	will	not	come	where	you	say	,	``	well	let	's	do	n't	use	that	 any 	 more 	 	.	``
you	'll	keep	using	it	.	it	is	the	cleanest	of	all	.
and	if	you	look	at	california	,	they	use	2,500	 bus 	 es 	 	.
lamta	have	 be 	 en 	 	on	natural	gas	for	25	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	ft.	worth	t	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	on	it	for	25	 year 	 s 	 	.
why	?	air	quality	was	the	reason	they	used	natural	gas	and	got	away	from	 dies 	 el 	 	.
why	are	all	the	trash	 truck 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	in	southern	california	on	natural	gas	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	air	quality	.
i	know	what	you	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	,	and	i	'm	not	disagreeing	with	you	.
how	in	the	hell	can	we	get	off	the	natural	gas	at	some	point	?
and	i	say	,	that	is	your	problem	.
ca	:	all	right	,	so	it	's	the	bridge	fuel	.
what	is	at	the	other	end	of	that	bridge	is	for	 th 	 is 	 	audience	to	figure	out	.
if	 some 	 one 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	you	with	a	plan	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	might	be	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	solution	,	are	you	ready	to	invest	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	even	if	they	are	n't	maximized	for	 profit 	 s 	 	,	they	might	be	maximized	for	the	future	health	of	the	planet	?
tbp	:	i	lost	150	million	on	the	wind	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 	,	i	'm	game	for	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	energy	 solve 	 d 	 	for	america	.
and	 any 	 thing 	 	american	will	work	for	me	.
ca	:	boone	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciate	you	coming	here	,	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	.
i	think	there	's	a	lot	of	people	who	will	want	to	engage	with	you	.
and	that	was	a	real	gift	you	 g 	 ave 	 	 th 	 is 	 	audience	.
thank	you	so	much	.
