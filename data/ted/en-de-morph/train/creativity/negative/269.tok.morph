cultural	evolution	is	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	child	for	any	species	to	let	loose	on	 it 	 s 	 	planet	.
by	the	time	you	 real 	 ize 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	the	child	is	a	toddler	,	up	and	 caus 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 voc 	 	,	and	it	's	too	late	to	put	it	back	.
we	 human 	 s 	 	are	earth	's	pandoran	species	.
we	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	let	the	second	 replica 	 tor 	 	out	of	 it 	 s 	 	box	,	and	we	ca	n't	push	it	back	in	.
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	all	around	us	.
now	that	,	i	suggest	,	is	the	view	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	taking	 meme 	 tics 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	not	 on 	 ly 	 	what	's	going	on	on	our	planet	,	but	what	might	be	going	on	 else 	 where 	 	in	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	.
so	first	of	all	,	i	'd	like	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 meme 	 tics 	 	and	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 meme 	 s 	 	,	and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	how	 th 	 is 	 	might	answer	 question 	 s 	 	about	who	's	out	there	,	if	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 any 	 one 	 	is	.
so	,	 meme 	 tics 	 	:	 meme 	 tics 	 	is	 found 	 ed 	 	on	the	principle	of	universal	darwinism	.
darwin	had	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	idea	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	some	people	say	it	's	the	best	idea	 any 	 body 	 	ever	had	.
is	n't	that	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thought	,	that	there	could	be	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	best	idea	 any 	 body 	 	ever	had	?
do	you	think	there	could	?
audience	:	no	.
susan	blackmore	:	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	no	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 loud 	 ly 	 	,	from	over	there	.
well	,	i	say	 y 	 es 	 	,	and	if	there	is	,	i	give	the	prize	to	darwin	.
why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	idea	was	so	simple	,	and	yet	it	 explain 	 s 	 	all	design	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
i	would	say	not	just	 bio 	 logical 	 	design	,	but	all	of	the	design	that	we	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	human	design	.
it	's	all	just	the	same	thing	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
what	did	darwin	say	?
i	know	you	know	the	idea	,	natural	 s 	 election 	 	,	but	let	me	just	 para 	 phrase 	 	``	the	origin	of	species	,	``	1859	,	in	a	few	 sentence 	 s 	 	.
what	darwin	 s 	 aid 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	if	you	have	 creature 	 s 	 	that	vary	,	and	that	ca	n't	be	 doubt 	 ed 	 	--	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	the	galapagos	,	and	i	've	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 beak 	 s 	 	and	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	turtle	 shell 	 s 	 	and	so	on	,	and	so	on	.
and	100	 page 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	if	there	is	a	struggle	for	life	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	 near 	 ly 	 	all	of	these	 creature 	 s 	 	die	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	ca	n't	be	 doubt 	 ed 	 	,	i	've	read	malthus	and	i	've	 calcul 	 ated 	 	how	long	it	would	take	for	 elephant 	 s 	 	to	cover	the	whole	world	if	they	 br 	 ed 	 	 un 	 restrict 	 ed 	 	,	and	so	on	and	so	on	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	100	 page 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	if	the	 ver 	 y 	 	few	that	 surviv 	 e 	 	pass	onto	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	it	was	that	 help 	 ed 	 	them	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	then	 t 	 hose 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	must	be	better	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	in	which	all	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
you	see	the	idea	?
if	,	if	,	if	,	then	.
he	had	no	 con 	 cept 	 	of	the	idea	of	an	algorithm	,	but	that	's	what	he	 de 	 scribed 	 	in	that	book	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	now	know	 a 	 s 	 	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	algorithm	.
the	principle	is	you	just	need	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	 s 	 election 	 	and	 her 	 ed 	 ity 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	dan	dennett	 put 	 s 	 	it	,	if	you	have	 t 	 hose 	 	,	then	you	must	get	evolution	.
or	design	out	of	 cha 	 os 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	aid	of	mind	.
there	's	one	word	i	love	on	that	slide	.
what	do	you	think	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	word	is	?
audience	:	 cha 	 os 	 	.
sb	:	 cha 	 os 	 	?	no	.	what	?	mind	?	no	.
audience	:	 with 	 out 	 	.
sb	:	no	,	not	 with 	 out 	 	.
you	try	them	all	in	order	:	mmm	...	?
audience	:	must	.
sb	:	must	,	at	must	.	must	,	must	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	it	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
you	do	n't	need	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	or	a	plan	,	or	 fore 	 sight 	 	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
if	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 cop 	 ied 	 	with	 vari 	 ation 	 	and	it	's	 select 	 ed 	 	,	then	you	must	get	design	 appear 	 ing 	 	out	of	 no 	 where 	 	.
you	ca	n't	stop	it	.
must	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	word	there	.
now	,	what	's	 th 	 is 	 	to	do	with	 meme 	 s 	 	?
well	,	the	principle	here	 appli 	 es 	 	to	 any 	 thing 	 	that	is	 cop 	 ied 	 	with	 vari 	 ation 	 	and	 s 	 election 	 	.
we	're	so	used	to	 think 	 ing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	biology	,	we	think	about	 gene 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
darwin	did	n't	,	of	course	;	he	did	n't	know	about	 gene 	 s 	 	.
he	 talk 	 ed 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	about	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 plant 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	about	 language 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	and	 be 	 coming 	 	extinct	.
but	the	principle	of	universal	darwinism	is	that	any	information	that	is	 vari 	 ed 	 	and	 select 	 ed 	 	will	produce	design	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	richard	dawkins	was	on	about	in	his	1976	 best 	 seller 	 	,	``	the	 self 	 ish 	 	gene	.	``
the	information	that	is	 cop 	 ied 	 	,	he	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 replica 	 tor 	 	.
it	 self 	 ish 	 ly 	 	copies	.
not	meaning	it	kind	of	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	around	 in 	 side 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	going	,	``	i	want	to	get	 cop 	 ied 	 	.	``
but	that	it	will	get	 cop 	 ied 	 	if	it	can	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	about	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	ca	n't	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	just	information	 be 	 ing 	 	 cop 	 ied 	 	.
and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	away	from	 every 	 body 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	all	the	time	about	 gene 	 s 	 	,	and	so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	is	there	 an 	 other 	 	 replica 	 tor 	 	out	there	on	the	planet	?	``
ah	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	there	is	.
look	around	you	--	here	will	do	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
all	around	us	,	still	 clumsi 	 ly 	 	 drift 	 ing 	 	about	in	 it 	 s 	 	 prime 	 val 	 	soup	of	culture	,	is	 an 	 other 	 	 replica 	 tor 	 	.
information	that	we	copy	from	person	to	person	,	by	 imit 	 ation 	 	,	by	language	,	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	by	 wear 	 ing 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	information	 cop 	 ied 	 	with	 vari 	 ation 	 	and	 s 	 election 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	design	process	going	on	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	a	name	for	the	new	 replica 	 tor 	 	.
so	,	he	took	the	greek	word	``	 mi 	 meme 	 	,	``	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	which	is	 imit 	 ated 	 	.
remember	that	,	that	's	the	core	definition	:	that	which	is	 imit 	 ated 	 	.
and	 abbrevi 	 ated 	 	it	to	meme	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	good	and	made	a	good	meme	,	an	effective	 spread 	 ing 	 	meme	.
so	that	's	how	the	idea	came	about	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	stick	with	that	definition	.
the	whole	science	of	 meme 	 tics 	 	is	much	 malign 	 ed 	 	,	much	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	,	much	 fear 	 ed 	 	.
but	a	lot	of	these	 problem 	 s 	 	can	be	 avoid 	 ed 	 	by	 remember 	 ing 	 	the	definition	.
a	meme	is	not	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	an	idea	.
it	's	not	an	idea	.	it	's	not	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	 any 	 thing 	 	else	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
stick	with	the	definition	.
it	's	that	which	is	 imit 	 ated 	 	,	or	information	which	is	 cop 	 ied 	 	from	person	to	person	.
so	,	let	's	see	some	 meme 	 s 	 	.
well	,	you	 s 	 ir 	 	,	you	've	got	 t 	 hose 	 	 glass 	 es 	 	hung	around	your	neck	in	that	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 fetch 	 ing 	 	way	.
i	wonder	 whet 	 her 	 	you	 invent 	 ed 	 	that	idea	for	 your 	 self 	 	,	or	 cop 	 ied 	 	it	from	 some 	 one 	 	else	?
if	you	 cop 	 ied 	 	it	from	 some 	 one 	 	else	,	it	's	a	meme	.
and	what	about	,	oh	,	i	ca	n't	see	any	 interest 	 ing 	 	 meme 	 s 	 	here	.
all	right	 every 	 one 	 	,	who	's	got	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 meme 	 s 	 	for	me	?
oh	,	well	,	your	 ear 	 ring 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	suppose	you	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	idea	of	 ear 	 ring 	 s 	 	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	went	out	and	 b 	 ought 	 	them	.
there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	more	in	the	 shop 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	from	person	to	person	.
all	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	we	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	--	well	,	of	course	,	ted	is	a	great	meme	-	fest	,	 masse 	 s 	 	of	 meme 	 s 	 	.
the	way	to	think	about	 meme 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	to	think	,	why	do	they	spread	?
they	're	 self 	 ish 	 	information	,	they	will	get	 cop 	 ied 	 	,	if	they	can	.
but	some	of	them	will	be	 cop 	 ied 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	good	,	or	true	,	or	 use 	 ful 	 	,	or	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
some	of	them	will	be	 cop 	 ied 	 	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	not	.
some	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	hard	to	tell	why	.
there	's	one	 part 	 icular 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	meme	which	i	 ra 	 ther 	 	enjoy	.
and	i	'm	glad	to	say	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	i	found	it	when	i	came	here	,	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	all	of	you	found	it	,	too	.
you	go	to	your	nice	,	 p 	 osh 	 	,	 inter 	 national 	 	hotel	 some 	 where 	 	,	and	you	come	in	and	you	put	down	your	 clothe 	 s 	 	and	you	go	to	the	 bath 	 room 	 	,	and	what	do	you	see	?
audience	:	 bath 	 room 	 	soap	.
sb	:	 par 	 don 	 	?
audience	:	soap	.
sb	:	soap	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	what	else	do	you	see	?
audience	:	sb	:	mmm	mmm	.
audience	:	sink	,	toilet	!
sb	:	sink	,	toilet	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	these	are	all	 meme 	 s 	 	,	they	're	all	 meme 	 s 	 	,	but	they	're	sort	of	 use 	 ful 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	and	then	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	one	 do 	 ing 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	spread	all	over	the	world	.
it	's	not	surprising	that	you	all	found	it	when	you	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	your	 bath 	 rooms 	 	here	.
but	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	in	a	toilet	at	the	back	of	a	tent	in	the	eco	-	camp	in	the	jungle	in	assam	.
who	 fold 	 ed 	 	that	thing	up	there	,	and	why	?
some	people	get	carried	away	.
other	people	are	just	 laz 	 y 	 	and	make	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
some	 hotel 	 s 	 	exploit	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	put	even	more	 meme 	 s 	 	with	a	little	 stick 	 er 	 	.
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	all	about	?
i	suppose	it	's	there	to	tell	you	that	 some 	 body 	 	's	 clean 	 ed 	 	the	place	,	and	it	's	all	 love 	 ly 	 	.
and	you	know	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	all	it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	is	that	 an 	 other 	 	person	 ha 	 s 	 	 potential 	 ly 	 	spread	 germ 	 s 	 	from	place	to	place	.
so	,	think	of	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
imagine	a	world	full	of	 brain 	 s 	 	and	far	more	 meme 	 s 	 	than	can	possibly	find	 home 	 s 	 	.
the	 meme 	 s 	 	are	all	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 cop 	 ied 	 	--	 try 	 ing 	 	,	in	 in 	 vert 	 ed 	 	 com 	 ma 	 s 	 	--	i.e	.	,	that	's	the	 short 	 hand 	 	for	,	if	they	can	get	 cop 	 ied 	 	,	they	will	.
they	're	using	you	and	me	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 propag 	 ating 	 	,	 copy 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	,	and	we	are	the	meme	 machine 	 s 	 	.
now	,	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	,	or	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	tell	us	?
it	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	view	of	human	 origin 	 s 	 	and	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	human	,	all	 convention 	 al 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	of	cultural	evolution	,	of	the	origin	of	 human 	 s 	 	,	and	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	so	different	from	other	species	.
all	other	 the 	 ories 	 	 explain 	 ing 	 	the	big	brain	,	and	language	,	and	tool	use	and	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	us	 un 	 ique 	 	,	are	based	 up 	 on 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	.
language	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	for	the	 gene 	 s 	 	.
tool	use	must	have	 enhance 	 d 	 	our	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	 mat 	 ing 	 	and	so	on	.
it	 al 	 ways 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	,	 a 	 s 	 	richard	dawkins	 complain 	 ed 	 	all	that	long	time	ago	,	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	 gene 	 s 	 	.
the	point	of	 meme 	 tics 	 	is	to	say	,	``	oh	no	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.	``
there	are	two	 replica 	 tors 	 	now	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
from	the	moment	that	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	two	and	a	half	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	or	so	,	 beg 	 an 	 	 imit 	 ating 	 	,	there	was	a	new	 copy 	 ing 	 	process	.
 copy 	 ing 	 	with	 vari 	 ation 	 	and	 s 	 election 	 	.
a	new	 replica 	 tor 	 	was	let	loose	,	and	it	could	never	be	--	right	from	the	start	--	it	could	never	be	that	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	who	let	loose	 th 	 is 	 	new	creature	,	could	just	copy	the	 use 	 ful 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	true	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	not	copy	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
while	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	advantage	from	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	copy	--	 light 	 ing 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	going	,	new	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	of	 hunt 	 ing 	 	,	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 inevit 	 ably 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 copy 	 ing 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	 feather 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	hair	,	or	 wear 	 ing 	 	strange	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	or	 paint 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
so	,	you	get	an	 arm 	 s 	 	race	between	the	 gene 	 s 	 	which	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	 human 	 s 	 	to	have	small	 economic 	 al 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	and	not	waste	 the 	 ir 	 	time	 copy 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	and	the	 meme 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	like	the	 sound 	 s 	 	that	people	made	and	 cop 	 ied 	 	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	what	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	language	--	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	 brain 	 s 	 	to	get	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	.
so	,	the	big	brain	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	,	is	driven	by	the	 meme 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	,	in	``	the	meme	machine	,	``	i	 call 	 ed 	 	it	 meme 	 tic 	 	drive	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	 meme 	 s 	 	evolve	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	 inevit 	 ably 	 	must	,	they	drive	a	 big 	 ger 	 	brain	that	is	better	at	 copy 	 ing 	 	the	 meme 	 s 	 	that	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	we	've	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	 s 	 uch 	 	peculiar	 brain 	 s 	 	,	that	we	like	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	music	,	and	art	.
language	is	a	 parasit 	 e 	 	that	we	've	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	,	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	there	 original 	 ly 	 	for	our	 gene 	 s 	 	,	and	like	most	 parasit 	 es 	 	,	it	can	begin	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	but	then	it	 co 	 evolve 	 s 	 	and	 adapt 	 s 	 	,	and	we	end	up	with	a	 sym 	 biotic 	 	relationship	with	 th 	 is 	 	new	 parasit 	 e 	 	.
and	so	,	from	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	we	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	that	that	's	how	it	 beg 	 an 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	view	of	what	 human 	 s 	 	are	.
all	other	species	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	are	gene	 machine 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	they	do	n't	 imit 	 ate 	 	at	all	well	,	 hard 	 ly 	 	at	all	.
we	 al 	 one 	 	are	gene	 machine 	 s 	 	and	meme	 machine 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	 meme 	 s 	 	took	a	gene	machine	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	meme	machine	.
but	that	's	not	all	.
we	have	a	new	kind	of	 meme 	 s 	 	now	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	for	a	long	time	,	since	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 meme 	 s 	 	a	lot	,	is	there	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	 meme 	 s 	 	that	we	copy	--	the	 word 	 s 	 	we	speak	to	each	other	,	the	 gest 	 ures 	 	we	copy	,	the	human	 thing 	 s 	 	--	and	all	these	 techno 	 logical 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	around	us	?
i	have	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	now	,	 call 	 ed 	 	them	all	 meme 	 s 	 	,	but	i	do	 honest 	 ly 	 	think	now	we	need	a	new	word	for	 techno 	 logical 	 	 meme 	 s 	 	.
let	's	call	them	techno	-	 meme 	 s 	 	or	 teme 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 process 	 es 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	different	.
we	 beg 	 an 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	with	writing	.
we	put	the	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	of	 meme 	 s 	 	out	there	on	a	clay	 table 	 t 	 	,	but	in	order	to	get	true	 teme 	 s 	 	and	true	teme	 machine 	 s 	 	,	you	need	to	get	the	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	the	 s 	 election 	 	and	the	 copy 	 ing 	 	,	all	 d 	 one 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.
we	're	at	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	point	where	we	're	 near 	 ly 	 	there	,	that	there	are	 machine 	 s 	 	like	that	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	in	the	short	time	i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	at	ted	,	i	see	we	're	even	 close 	 r 	 	than	i	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	before	.
so	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	now	the	 teme 	 s 	 	are	forcing	our	 brain 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	like	teme	 machine 	 s 	 	.
our	children	are	growing	up	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	read	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	use	 machine 	 ry 	 	.
we	're	going	to	have	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 implant 	 s 	 	,	 drug 	 s 	 	that	force	us	to	stay	awake	all	the	time	.
we	'll	think	we	're	 choos 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 teme 	 s 	 	are	making	us	do	it	.
so	,	we	're	at	 th 	 is 	 	 cus 	 p 	 	now	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	third	 replica 	 tor 	 	on	our	planet	.
now	,	what	about	what	else	is	going	on	out	there	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	?
is	there	 any 	 one 	 	else	out	there	?
people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	for	a	long	time	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	it	here	at	ted	 al 	 ready 	 	.
in	1961	,	frank	drake	made	his	famous	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	but	i	think	he	 concent 	 rated 	 	on	the	wrong	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	productive	,	that	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	estimate	n	,	the	number	of	communicative	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	out	there	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	,	and	he	 include 	 d 	 	in	there	the	rate	of	star	 form 	 ation 	 	,	the	rate	of	 planet 	 s 	 	,	but	 cruci 	 ally 	 	,	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
i	think	that	's	the	wrong	way	to	think	about	it	.
 intellig 	 ence 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	all	over	the	place	,	in	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 guise 	 s 	 	.
human	 intellig 	 ence 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	kind	of	a	thing	.
but	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	the	 replica 	 tors 	 	you	have	and	the	 level 	 s 	 	of	 replica 	 tors 	 	,	one	 feed 	 ing 	 	on	the	one	before	.
so	,	i	would	suggest	that	we	do	n't	think	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	we	think	 replica 	 tors 	 	.
and	on	that	 bas 	 is 	 	,	i	've	 suggest 	 ed 	 	a	different	kind	of	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
n	,	the	same	thing	,	the	number	of	communicative	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	out	there	[	that	]	we	might	expect	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	.
just	start	with	the	number	of	 planet 	 s 	 	there	are	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	.
the	fraction	of	 t 	 hose 	 	which	get	a	first	 replica 	 tor 	 	.
the	fraction	of	 t 	 hose 	 	that	get	the	second	 replica 	 tor 	 	.
the	fraction	of	 t 	 hose 	 	that	get	the	third	 replica 	 tor 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	the	third	 replica 	 tor 	 	that	's	going	to	reach	out	--	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	information	,	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 prob 	 es 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	out	there	,	and	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	with	 any 	 where 	 	else	.
ok	,	so	if	we	take	that	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	why	have	n't	we	heard	from	 any 	 body 	 	out	there	?
 be 	 cause 	 	every	step	is	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
 get 	 ting 	 	a	new	 replica 	 tor 	 	is	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
you	can	pull	through	,	we	have	 pull 	 ed 	 	through	,	but	it	's	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
take	the	first	step	,	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	life	 appear 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	.
we	may	take	the	gaian	view	.
i	 love 	 d 	 	peter	ward	's	talk	 yester 	 day 	 	--	it	's	not	gaian	all	the	time	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	life	 form 	 s 	 	produce	 thing 	 s 	 	that	kill	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
well	,	we	did	pull	through	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
but	then	,	a	long	time	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	got	the	second	 replica 	 tor 	 	,	the	 meme 	 s 	 	.
that	was	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	all	right	.
think	of	the	big	brain	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	do	we	have	here	?
you	know	all	about	big	 brain 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 danger 	 ous 	 	to	give	birth	to	,	are	 agon 	 izing 	 	to	give	birth	to	.
my	cat	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	to	four	 kit 	 ten 	 s 	 	,	 pur 	 ring 	 	all	the	time	.
ah	,	mm	--	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	.
but	not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	it	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	it	 kill 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	it	 kill 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 mother 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	to	produce	.
the	 gene 	 s 	 	are	 force 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	producing	all	 th 	 is 	 	 myel 	 in 	 	,	all	the	fat	to	 myel 	 in 	 ate 	 	the	brain	.
do	you	know	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	,	your	brain	is	using	about	20	percent	of	your	body	's	energy	 out 	 put 	 	for	two	percent	of	your	body	weight	?
it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	expensive	organ	to	run	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	producing	the	 meme 	 s 	 	.
now	,	it	could	have	 kill 	 ed 	 	us	off	.	it	could	have	 kill 	 ed 	 	us	off	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	it	 near 	 ly 	 	did	,	but	you	see	,	we	do	n't	know	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	it	 near 	 ly 	 	did	.
 ha 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 en 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	before	?
what	about	all	 t 	 hose 	 	other	species	?
louise	leakey	 talk 	 ed 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	about	how	we	're	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	in	 th 	 is 	 	branch	left	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 other 	 s 	 	?
could	it	be	that	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	in	 imit 	 ation 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	in	a	second	 replica 	 tor 	 	,	is	 danger 	 ous 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	kill	people	off	?
well	,	we	did	pull	through	,	and	we	 adapt 	 ed 	 	.
but	now	,	we	're	hitting	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	just	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	we	're	hitting	the	third	 replica 	 tor 	 	point	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	even	more	 danger 	 ous 	 	--	well	,	it	's	 danger 	 ous 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 teme 	 s 	 	are	 self 	 ish 	 	 replica 	 tors 	 	and	they	do	n't	care	about	us	,	or	our	planet	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
they	're	just	information	,	why	would	they	?
they	are	using	us	to	suck	up	the	planet	's	 resource 	 s 	 	to	produce	more	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	more	of	all	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	here	at	ted	.
do	n't	think	,	``	oh	,	we	 create 	 d 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	for	our	own	benefit	.	``
that	's	how	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	us	.
think	,	 teme 	 s 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	must	.
we	are	the	old	 machine 	 s 	 	.
now	,	are	we	going	to	pull	through	?
what	's	going	to	happen	?
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	to	pull	through	?
well	,	there	are	kind	of	two	ways	of	 pull 	 ing 	 	through	.
one	that	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	around	us	now	,	is	that	the	 teme 	 s 	 	turn	us	 in 	 to 	 	teme	 machine 	 s 	 	,	with	these	 implant 	 s 	 	,	with	the	 drug 	 s 	 	,	with	us	 mer 	 ging 	 	with	the	technology	.
and	why	would	they	do	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	self	-	 replica 	 ting 	 	.
we	have	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
we	make	new	 one 	 s 	 	,	and	so	it	's	convenient	to	 piggy 	 back 	 	on	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	not	yet	at	the	stage	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	where	the	other	option	is	 vi 	 able 	 	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 close 	 r 	 	,	i	heard	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 close 	 r 	 	than	i	thought	it	was	.
where	the	teme	 machine 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	will	replicate	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
that	way	,	it	would	n't	matter	if	the	planet	's	climate	was	 utter 	 ly 	 	 de 	 stabil 	 ized 	 	,	and	it	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	possible	for	 human 	 s 	 	to	live	here	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	teme	 machine 	 s 	 	,	they	would	n't	need	--	they	're	not	 squish 	 y 	 	,	wet	,	oxygen	-	 breath 	 ing 	 	,	 warm 	 th 	 	-	 requir 	 ing 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
they	could	carry	on	 with 	 out 	 	us	.
so	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	two	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
the	second	,	i	do	n't	think	we	're	that	close	.
it	's	coming	,	but	we	're	not	there	yet	.
the	first	,	it	's	coming	too	.
but	the	damage	that	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	the	planet	is	 show 	 ing 	 	us	how	 danger 	 ous 	 	the	third	point	is	,	that	third	danger	point	,	 get 	 ting 	 	a	third	 replica 	 tor 	 	.
and	will	we	get	through	 th 	 is 	 	third	danger	point	,	like	we	got	through	the	second	and	like	we	got	through	the	first	?
 may 	 be 	 	we	will	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	wo	n't	.
i	have	no	idea	.
