``	people	do	stupid	 thing 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	 spread 	 s 	 	hiv	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 head 	 line 	 	in	a	u.k.	 news 	 paper 	 	,	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	,	not	that	long	ago	.
i	'm	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	,	who	 agree 	 s 	 	with	it	?
well	,	one	or	two	brave	 soul 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	direct	quote	from	an	 epidemio 	 logist 	 	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	in	field	of	hiv	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ed 	 	on	four	 continent 	 s 	 	,	and	you	're	looking	at	her	.
and	i	am	now	going	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	half	true	.
people	do	get	hiv	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	stupid	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	most	of	them	are	 do 	 ing 	 	stupid	 thing 	 s 	 	for	 perfect 	 ly 	 	rational	 reason 	 s 	 	.
now	,	``	rational	``	is	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	paradigm	in	public	health	,	and	if	you	put	your	public	health	nerd	 glass 	 es 	 	on	,	you	'll	see	that	if	we	give	people	the	information	that	they	need	about	what	's	good	for	them	and	what	's	bad	for	them	,	if	you	give	them	the	 service 	 s 	 	that	they	can	use	to	act	on	that	information	,	and	a	little	bit	of	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	people	will	make	rational	 decision 	 s 	 	and	live	long	and	 health 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
that	's	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 problem 	 atic 	 	for	me	 be 	 cause 	 	i	work	in	hiv	,	and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	all	know	that	hiv	is	about	poverty	and	gender	 ine 	 quality 	 	,	and	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	at	ted	'07	it	's	about	coffee	 price 	 s 	 	...
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	hiv	's	about	 s 	 ex 	 	and	 drug 	 s 	 	,	and	if	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	irrational	,	they	are	 erect 	 ions 	 	and	 addict 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	let	's	start	with	what	's	rational	for	an	addict	.
now	,	i	remember	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	an	indonesian	friend	of	mine	,	frankie	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	lunch	and	he	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	about	when	he	was	in	jail	in	bali	for	a	drug	 inject 	 ion 	 	.
it	was	 some 	 one 	 	's	 birth 	 day 	 	,	and	they	had	 ver 	 y 	 	 kind 	 ly 	 	 smuggle 	 d 	 	some	 hero 	 in 	 	 in 	 to 	 	jail	,	and	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ously 	 	sharing	it	out	with	all	of	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 every 	 one 	 	lined	up	,	all	the	 s 	 mack 	 head 	 s 	 	in	a	row	,	and	the	guy	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 birth 	 day 	 	it	was	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	the	fit	,	and	he	went	down	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 inject 	 ing 	 	people	.
so	he	 inject 	 s 	 	the	first	guy	,	and	then	he	's	 wi 	 ping 	 	the	needle	on	his	shirt	,	and	he	 inject 	 s 	 	the	next	guy	.
and	frankie	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	number	22	in	line	,	and	i	can	see	the	needle	coming	down	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	me	,	and	there	is	blood	all	over	the	place	.
it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 blunt 	 er 	 	and	 blunt 	 er 	 	.
and	a	small	part	of	my	brain	is	 think 	 ing 	 	,	'	that	is	so	gross	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	'	but	most	of	my	brain	is	 think 	 ing 	 	,	'	 pleas 	 e 	 	let	there	be	some	 s 	 mack 	 	left	by	the	time	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	me	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	let	there	be	some	left	.	'	``	and	then	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	frankie	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	...	god	,	 drug 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	make	you	stupid	.	``
and	,	you	know	,	you	ca	n't	fault	him	for	 accu 	 racy 	 	.
but	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	frankie	,	at	that	time	,	was	a	 hero 	 in 	 	addict	and	he	was	in	jail	.
so	his	choice	was	either	to	accept	that	 dirt 	 y 	 	needle	or	not	to	get	high	.
and	if	there	's	one	place	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	get	high	,	it	's	when	you	're	in	jail	.
but	i	'm	a	scientist	and	i	do	n't	like	to	make	data	out	of	 anecdote 	 s 	 	,	so	let	's	look	at	some	data	.
we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	600	drug	 addict 	 s 	 	in	three	cities	in	indonesia	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	do	you	know	how	you	get	hiv	?	``
``	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	by	sharing	 needle 	 s 	 	.	``
i	mean	,	 near 	 ly 	 	100	percent	.	 yea 	 h 	 	,	by	sharing	 needle 	 s 	 	.
and	,	``	do	you	know	where	you	can	get	a	clean	needle	at	a	price	you	can	afford	to	avoid	that	?	``
``	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	.	``	hundred	percent	.
``	we	're	 s 	 mack 	 head 	 s 	 	;	we	know	where	to	get	clean	 needle 	 s 	 	.	``
``	so	are	you	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	needle	?	``
we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interview 	 ing 	 	people	on	the	street	,	in	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	they	're	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	and	taking	 drug 	 s 	 	.
``	are	you	 carry 	 ing 	 	clean	 needle 	 s 	 	?	``
one	in	four	,	 maxim 	 um 	 	.
so	no	 surprise 	 s 	 	then	that	the	proportion	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	clean	 needle 	 s 	 	every	time	they	 inject 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	week	is	just	about	one	in	10	,	and	the	other	nine	in	10	are	sharing	.
so	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	massive	 mis 	 match 	 	;	 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	if	they	share	they	're	going	to	get	hiv	,	but	they	're	all	sharing	 any 	 way 	 	.
so	what	's	that	about	?	is	it	like	you	get	a	better	high	if	you	share	or	 some 	 thing 	 	?
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	that	to	a	 junk 	 ie 	 	and	they	're	like	,	``	are	you	nuts	?	``
you	do	n't	want	to	share	a	needle	 any 	 more 	 	than	you	want	to	share	a	 tooth 	 brush 	 	even	with	 some 	 one 	 	you	're	 sleep 	 ing 	 	with	.
there	's	just	kind	of	an	ick	factor	there	.
``	no	,	no	.	we	share	 needle 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	want	to	go	to	jail	.	``
so	,	in	indonesia	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	needle	and	the	 cop 	 s 	 	 round 	 ed 	 	you	up	,	they	could	put	you	 in 	 to 	 	jail	.
and	that	 change 	 s 	 	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	?
 be 	 cause 	 	your	choice	now	is	either	i	use	my	own	needle	now	,	or	i	could	share	a	needle	now	and	get	a	disease	that	's	going	to	possibly	kill	me	10	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	or	i	could	use	my	own	needle	now	and	go	to	jail	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
and	while	 junk 	 ies 	 	think	that	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	idea	to	 ex 	 pose 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	hiv	,	they	think	it	's	a	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	idea	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	next	year	in	jail	where	they	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	end	up	in	frankie	's	 situ 	 ation 	 	and	 ex 	 pose 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	hiv	 any 	 way 	 	.
so	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	rational	to	share	 needle 	 s 	 	.
now	,	let	's	look	at	it	from	a	policy	maker	's	point	of	view	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	problem	.
for	once	,	your	 incentive 	 s 	 	are	 align 	 ed 	 	.
we	've	got	what	's	rational	for	public	health	.
you	want	people	to	use	clean	 needle 	 s 	 	--	and	 junk 	 ies 	 	want	to	use	clean	 needle 	 s 	 	.
so	we	could	make	 th 	 is 	 	problem	go	away	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	making	clean	 needle 	 s 	 	 universal 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	and	taking	away	the	fear	of	arrest	.
now	,	the	first	person	to	figure	that	out	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	on	a	national	scale	was	that	well	-	known	,	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	heart	liberal	margaret	thatcher	.
and	she	put	in	the	world	's	first	national	needle	 ex 	 change 	 	program	,	and	other	 count 	 ries 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	suit	:	australia	,	the	netherlands	and	few	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	in	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	you	can	see	,	not	more	than	four	percent	of	 inject 	 ors 	 	ever	 be 	 came 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	hiv	.
now	,	 place 	 s 	 	that	did	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	new	york	city	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	moscow	,	jakarta	--	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	at	 it 	 s 	 	peak	,	one	in	two	 inject 	 ors 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	fatal	disease	.
now	,	margaret	thatcher	did	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 ha 	 s 	 	any	great	love	for	 junk 	 ies 	 	.
she	did	it	 be 	 cause 	 	she	ran	a	country	that	had	a	national	health	service	.
so	,	if	she	did	n't	invest	in	effective	 prevent 	 ion 	 	,	she	was	going	to	have	pick	up	the	 cost 	 s 	 	of	 treat 	 ment 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	on	,	and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	are	much	 high 	 er 	 	.
so	she	was	making	a	 politic 	 ally 	 	rational	decision	.
now	,	if	i	take	out	my	public	health	nerd	 glass 	 es 	 	here	and	look	at	these	data	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	a	no	-	 brain 	 er 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	?
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	where	the	government	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	feel	 compel 	 led 	 	to	provide	health	care	for	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	we	've	taken	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	approach	.
so	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	 review 	 ing 	 	the	data	--	 end 	 lessly 	 	 review 	 ing 	 	the	data	.
so	,	these	are	 review 	 s 	 	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	by	all	the	big	muckety	-	mucks	of	the	scientific	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	these	are	the	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	show	needle	 program 	 s 	 	are	effective	--	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	them	.
now	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	show	that	needle	 program 	 s 	 	are	n't	effective	--	you	think	that	's	one	of	these	 annoy 	 ing 	 	dynamic	 slide 	 s 	 	and	i	'm	going	to	press	my	 don 	 gle 	 	and	the	rest	of	it	's	going	to	come	up	,	but	no	--	that	's	the	whole	slide	.
there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	on	the	other	side	.
so	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	irrational	,	you	would	think	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	that	,	wait	a	minute	,	 politic 	 ians 	 	are	rational	,	too	,	and	they	're	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	what	they	think	the	 vot 	 ers 	 	want	.
so	what	we	see	is	that	 vot 	 ers 	 	respond	 ver 	 y 	 	well	to	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	not	 quit 	 e 	 	so	well	to	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	rational	to	 den 	 y 	 	 service 	 s 	 	to	 inject 	 ors 	 	.
now	let	's	talk	about	 s 	 ex 	 	.
are	we	any	more	rational	about	 s 	 ex 	 	?
well	,	i	'm	not	even	going	to	address	the	 clear 	 ly 	 	irrational	 position 	 s 	 	of	people	like	the	catholic	church	,	who	think	 some 	 how 	 	that	if	you	give	out	 condom 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	's	going	to	run	out	and	have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	if	 pop 	 e 	 	benedict	 watch 	 es 	 	tedtalks	 on 	 line 	 	,	but	if	you	do	,	i	've	got	news	for	you	benedict	--	i	carry	 condom 	 s 	 	all	the	time	and	i	never	get	laid	.
it	's	not	that	easy	!
here	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	'll	have	better	luck	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	hiv	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	that	easy	to	transmit	 sexual 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	how	much	virus	there	is	in	your	blood	and	in	your	body	 fluid 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	've	got	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	high	level	of	virus	right	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	when	you	're	first	 infect 	 ed 	 	,	then	you	start	making	 anti 	 bodies 	 	,	and	then	it	 bump 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	at	 quit 	 e 	 	low	 level 	 s 	 	for	a	long	time	--	10	or	12	 year 	 s 	 	--	you	have	 spike 	 s 	 	if	you	get	 an 	 other 	 	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	much	is	going	on	 un 	 til 	 	you	start	to	get	 symptom 	 atic 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	,	and	by	that	stage	,	you	're	not	looking	great	,	you	're	not	 feel 	 ing 	 	great	,	you	're	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	that	much	 s 	 ex 	 	.
so	the	sexual	 trans 	 mission 	 	of	hiv	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	 determine 	 d 	 	by	how	 man 	 y 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	you	have	in	these	 ver 	 y 	 	short	 space 	 s 	 	of	time	when	you	have	peak	viremia	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	people	crazy	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	have	to	talk	about	some	 group 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	more	sexual	 partner 	 s 	 	in	 short 	 er 	 	 space 	 s 	 	of	time	than	other	 group 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	 consider 	 ed 	 	 stigma 	 tizing 	 	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	bit	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	that	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	stigma	is	a	bad	thing	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 ex 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	a	good	thing	,	but	we	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	that	be	.
the	truth	is	that	20	 year 	 s 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	good	research	have	 show 	 n 	 	us	that	there	are	 group 	 s 	 	that	are	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 turn 	 over 	 	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	 partner 	 s 	 	in	a	short	space	of	time	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 group 	 s 	 	are	,	 global 	 ly 	 	,	people	who	sell	 s 	 ex 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	more	regular	 partner 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 ga 	 y 	 	men	on	the	party	scene	who	have	,	on	average	,	three	 time 	 s 	 	more	 partner 	 s 	 	than	straight	people	on	the	party	scene	.
and	they	are	 hetero 	 sexual 	 s 	 	who	come	from	 count 	 ries 	 	that	have	 tradition 	 s 	 	of	 poly 	 gam 	 y 	 	and	 relat 	 ively 	 	high	 level 	 s 	 	of	female	 auto 	 nomy 	 	,	and	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	are	in	east	or	southern	africa	.
and	that	is	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	that	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	.
you	can	see	these	 horr 	 ifying 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	from	africa	.
these	are	all	 count 	 ries 	 	in	southern	africa	where	between	one	in	seven	,	and	one	in	three	of	all	 adult 	 s 	 	,	are	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	hiv	.
now	,	in	the	rest	of	the	world	,	we	've	got	 bas 	 ically 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	going	on	in	the	general	population	--	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 level 	 s 	 	--	but	we	have	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	high	 level 	 s 	 	of	hiv	in	these	other	 population 	 s 	 	who	are	at	highest	risk	:	drug	 inject 	 ors 	 	,	 s 	 ex 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	and	 ga 	 y 	 	men	.
and	you	'll	note	,	that	's	the	local	data	from	los	angeles	:	25	percent	 pre 	 valence 	 	among	 ga 	 y 	 	men	.
of	course	,	you	ca	n't	get	hiv	just	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	 un 	 protect 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	.
you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	hiv	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	 un 	 protect 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	with	a	positive	person	.
in	most	of	the	world	,	these	few	 prevent 	 ion 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	 not 	 with 	 stand 	 ing 	 	,	we	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	well	these	 day 	 s 	 	in	commercial	 s 	 ex 	 	:	condom	use	rates	are	between	80	and	100	percent	in	commercial	 s 	 ex 	 	in	most	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	an	 align 	 ment 	 	of	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
what	's	rational	for	public	health	is	 al 	 so 	 	rational	for	individual	 s 	 ex 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	for	business	to	have	 an 	 other 	 	sti	.
no	one	 want 	 s 	 	it	.
and	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 client 	 s 	 	do	n't	want	to	go	home	with	a	drip	either	.
so	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	you	're	able	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	high	rates	of	condom	use	in	commercial	 s 	 ex 	 	.
but	in	``	 intima 	 te 	 	``	 relation 	 s 	 	it	's	much	more	difficult	 be 	 cause 	 	,	with	your	wife	or	your	boyfriend	or	 some 	 one 	 	that	you	hope	might	turn	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	illusion	of	 rom 	 ance 	 	and	trust	and	 in 	 timacy 	 	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	so	 un 	 romantic 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	,	``	my	condom	or	 your 	 s 	 	,	 darl 	 ing 	 	?	``	question	.
so	in	the	face	of	that	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	need	 quit 	 e 	 	a	strong	incentive	to	use	 condom 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 gentle 	 man 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	joseph	.
he	's	from	 ha 	 iti 	 	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	.
and	he	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 s 	 ex 	 	right	now	,	but	he	is	a	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	in	the	population	,	of	why	you	might	want	to	be	using	 condom 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	and	is	a	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	of	why	you	might	want	to	be	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 funni 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	joseph	after	six	 month 	 s 	 	on	 anti 	 retroviral 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
not	for	 noth 	 ing 	 	do	we	call	it	the	lazarus	effect	.
but	it	is	changing	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	of	what	's	rational	in	sexual	decision	-	making	.
so	,	what	we	've	got	--	some	people	say	,	``	oh	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 treat 	 ment 	 	is	effective	 prevent 	 ion 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 lower 	 s 	 	your	viral	load	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	more	difficult	to	transmit	hiv	.	``
so	,	if	you	look	at	the	viremia	thing	 aga 	 in 	 	,	if	you	do	start	 treat 	 ment 	 	when	you	're	sick	,	well	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?	your	viral	load	 come 	 s 	 	down	.
but	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	what	?	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	're	not	on	 treat 	 ment 	 	?
well	,	you	die	,	so	your	viral	load	 go 	 es 	 	to	zero	.
and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	green	stuff	here	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 spike 	 s 	 	--	which	are	 be 	 cause 	 	you	could	n't	get	to	the	 pharma 	 cy 	 	,	or	you	ran	out	of	 drug 	 s 	 	,	or	you	went	on	a	three	day	party	 bing 	 e 	 	and	 for 	 got 	 	to	take	your	 drug 	 s 	 	,	or	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	 resist 	 ance 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	--	all	of	that	is	virus	that	would	n't	be	out	there	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
now	,	am	i	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	,	well	,	great	 prevent 	 ion 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
let	's	just	stop	 treat 	 ing 	 	people	.	``
of	course	not	,	of	course	not	.
we	need	to	expand	 anti 	 retroviral 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	.
but	what	i	am	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 call 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	question	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	say	that	more	 treat 	 ment 	 	is	all	the	 prevent 	 ion 	 	we	need	.
that	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	true	,	and	i	think	we	can	learn	a	lot	from	the	experience	of	 ga 	 y 	 	men	in	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	where	 treat 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	for	going	on	15	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
and	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	is	that	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	condom	use	rates	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	high	--	the	 ga 	 y 	 	community	 respond 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	to	hiv	,	with	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	little	help	from	public	health	 nerd 	 s 	 	,	i	would	say	--	that	condom	use	rate	 ha 	 s 	 	come	down	 dramat 	 ically 	 	since	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	:	one	is	the	assumption	of	,	``	oh	well	,	if	he	's	 infect 	 ed 	 	,	he	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	on	 med 	 s 	 	,	and	his	viral	load	's	going	to	be	low	,	so	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	safe	.	``
and	the	other	thing	is	that	people	are	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	of	hiv	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	of	 aid 	 s 	 	,	and	 right 	 ly 	 	so	.
 aid 	 s 	 	was	a	 dis 	 figur 	 ing 	 	disease	that	 kill 	 ed 	 	you	,	and	hiv	is	an	 in 	 visible 	 	virus	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	take	a	pill	every	day	.
and	that	's	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	but	is	it	 a 	 s 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	use	a	condom	every	time	you	have	 s 	 ex 	 	,	no	matter	how	drunk	you	are	,	no	matter	how	 man 	 y 	 	 po 	 ppers 	 	you	've	taken	,	 what 	 ever 	 	?
if	we	look	at	the	data	,	we	can	see	that	the	answer	to	that	question	is	,	mmm	.
so	these	are	data	from	scotland	.
you	see	the	peak	in	drug	 inject 	 ors 	 	before	they	 start 	 ed 	 	the	national	needle	 ex 	 change 	 	program	.
then	it	came	way	down	.
and	both	in	 hetero 	 sexual 	 s 	 	--	 most 	 ly 	 	in	commercial	 s 	 ex 	 	--	and	in	drug	 user 	 s 	 	,	you	've	 re 	 ally 	 	got	 noth 	 ing 	 	much	going	on	after	 treat 	 ment 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	 align 	 ment 	 	of	 incentive 	 s 	 	that	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
but	in	 ga 	 y 	 	men	,	you	've	got	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	rise	 start 	 ing 	 	three	or	four	 year 	 s 	 	after	 treat 	 ment 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	of	new	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 combine 	 d 	 	effect	of	 be 	 ing 	 	less	 worri 	 ed 	 	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	more	virus	out	there	in	the	population	--	more	people	living	 long 	 er 	 	,	 health 	 ier 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 get 	 ting 	 	laid	with	hiv	--	is	 outweigh 	 ing 	 	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	lower	viral	load	,	and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 worri 	 some 	 	thing	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	we	need	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	more	 prevent 	 ion 	 	the	more	 treat 	 ment 	 	we	have	.
is	that	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
no	,	and	i	call	it	the	``	 compass 	 ion 	 	 con 	 un 	 drum 	 	.	``
we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	the	last	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	that	people	are	 un 	 able 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	put	in	good	sexual	and	 re 	 productive 	 	health	 service 	 s 	 	for	 s 	 ex 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	,	 un 	 able 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	to	be	giving	out	 needle 	 s 	 	to	 junk 	 ies 	 	.
but	once	they	've	gone	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 transgress 	 ive 	 	people	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	want	to	 con 	 d 	 one 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	,	we	come	over	all	 com 	 passionate 	 	and	buy	them	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	expensive	 drug 	 s 	 	for	the	rest	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	from	a	public	health	point	of	view	.
i	want	to	give	what	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	the	last	word	to	ines	.
ines	is	a	a	 trans 	 gender 	 	 hook 	 er 	 	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	jakarta	;	she	's	a	chick	with	a	 d 	 ick 	 	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	she	do	that	job	?
well	,	of	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	 force 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	better	option	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
and	if	we	could	just	teach	her	to	sew	and	get	her	a	nice	job	in	a	 factor 	 y 	 	,	all	would	be	well	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 factor 	 y 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	earn	in	an	hour	in	indonesia	:	on	average	,	20	 cent 	 s 	 	.
it	 varie 	 s 	 	a	bit	 pro 	 vince 	 	to	 pro 	 vince 	 	.
i	do	speak	to	 s 	 ex 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	,	15,000	of	them	for	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	slide	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 s 	 ex 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	say	they	earn	in	an	hour	.
so	it	's	not	a	great	job	,	but	for	a	lot	of	people	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	a	rational	choice	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	ines	.
we	've	got	the	 tool 	 s 	 	,	the	knowledge	and	the	cash	,	and	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	 prevent 	 ing 	 	hiv	too	.
ines	:	so	why	is	 pre 	 valence 	 	still	 ris 	 ing 	 	?
it	's	all	 politic 	 s 	 	.
when	you	get	to	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 make 	 s 	 	sense	.
elizabeth	pisani	:	``	when	you	get	to	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 make 	 s 	 	sense	.	``
so	,	from	the	point	of	view	of	a	 s 	 ex 	 	 work 	 er 	 	,	 politic 	 ians 	 	are	making	no	sense	.
from	the	point	of	view	of	a	public	health	nerd	,	 junk 	 ies 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	dumb	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	truth	is	that	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	different	 rational 	 e 	 	.
there	are	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	different	ways	of	 be 	 ing 	 	rational	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	,	and	that	's	one	of	the	 glor 	 ies 	 	of	human	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
but	 t 	 hose 	 	ways	of	 be 	 ing 	 	rational	are	not	 in 	 dependent 	 	of	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	so	it	's	rational	for	a	drug	 inject 	 or 	 	to	share	 needle 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	stupid	decision	that	's	made	by	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	,	and	it	's	rational	for	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	to	make	that	stupid	decision	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	what	they	think	the	 vot 	 ers 	 	want	.
but	here	's	the	thing	:	we	are	the	 vot 	 ers 	 	.
we	're	not	all	of	them	,	of	course	,	but	ted	is	a	community	of	opinion	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	who	's	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	who	's	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	out	there	on	the	web	,	i	think	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	duty	to	demand	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 politic 	 ians 	 	that	we	make	policy	based	on	scientific	evidence	and	on	common	sense	.
it	's	going	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	for	us	to	 individual 	 ly 	 	affect	what	's	rational	for	every	frankie	and	every	ines	out	there	,	but	you	can	at	 l 	 east 	 	use	your	vote	to	stop	 politic 	 ians 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	stupid	 thing 	 s 	 	that	spread	hiv	.
thank	you	.
