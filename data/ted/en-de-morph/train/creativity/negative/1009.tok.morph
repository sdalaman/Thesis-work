mountain	 bi 	 king 	 	in	israel	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	do	with	great	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	 commit 	 ment 	 	.
and	when	i	'm	on	my	bike	,	i	feel	that	i	connect	with	the	 pro 	 found 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	israel	,	and	i	feel	that	i	'm	 unit 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	country	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	biblical	law	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	for	me	,	 bi 	 king 	 	is	a	matter	of	 empower 	 ment 	 	.
when	i	reach	the	 summ 	 it 	 	of	a	steep	mountain	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	,	i	feel	young	,	 invinc 	 ible 	 	,	 e 	 ternal 	 	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	i	'm	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	some	 leg 	 acy 	 	or	with	some	energy	far	 great 	 er 	 	than	 my 	 self 	 	.
you	can	see	my	fellow	 rider 	 s 	 	at	the	end	of	the	picture	,	looking	at	me	with	some	concern	.
and	here	is	 an 	 other 	 	picture	of	them	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	can	not	show	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	 n 	 either 	 	can	i	 dis 	 close 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	true	 name 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	my	fellow	 rider 	 s 	 	are	juvenile	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	,	 offend 	 ers 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	time	in	a	 correct 	 ion 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	about	20	 minute 	 s 	 	'	ride	from	here	--	well	,	like	 every 	 thing 	 	in	israel	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 rid 	 ing 	 	with	these	 kid 	 s 	 	once	a	week	,	every	tuesday	,	rain	or	shine	,	for	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	and	by	now	,	they	've	 be 	 come 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	part	of	my	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	story	 beg 	 an 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	 correct 	 ion 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	where	they	are	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	right	in	the	middle	of	one	of	my	usual	 trip 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 barb 	 ed 	 	 wire 	 s 	 	and	electric	 gate 	 s 	 	and	 arm 	 ed 	 	 guard 	 s 	 	.
so	on	one	of	these	 ride 	 s 	 	,	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	my	way	 in 	 to 	 	the	 com 	 pound 	 	and	went	to	see	the	 ward 	 en 	 	.
i	told	the	 ward 	 en 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	start	a	mountain	 bi 	 king 	 	club	in	 th 	 is 	 	place	and	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	take	the	 kid 	 s 	 	from	here	to	there	.
and	i	told	him	,	``	let	's	find	a	way	in	which	i	'll	be	able	to	take	out	10	 kid 	 s 	 	once	a	week	to	ride	with	in	the	summer	in	the	country	.	``
and	the	 ward 	 en 	 	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 amuse 	 d 	 	,	and	he	told	me	he	thought	that	i	was	a	nut	and	he	told	me	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	place	is	a	 correct 	 ion 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	.	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	serious	 offend 	 ers 	 	.
they	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	.
they	are	n't	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	out	at	large	.	``
and	yet	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	talk	about	it	,	and	one	thing	led	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	i	ca	n't	see	 my 	 self 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	state	 pri 	 son 	 	in	new	jersey	and	making	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 pro 	 position 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	israel	,	the	 ward 	 en 	 	 some 	 how 	 	made	it	happen	.
and	so	two	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	found	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	``	at	large	``	--	 my 	 self 	 	,	10	juvenile	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	and	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	fellow	named	russ	,	who	 be 	 came 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	friend	of	mine	and	my	partner	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
and	in	the	next	few	 week 	 s 	 	,	i	had	the	tremendous	pleasure	of	 introduc 	 ing 	 	these	 kid 	 s 	 	to	the	world	of	total	 free 	 dom 	 	,	a	world	 consist 	 ing 	 	of	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 vista 	 s 	 	like	these	--	 every 	 thing 	 	you	see	here	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	in	israel	--	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	close	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	with	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	small	 creature 	 s 	 	coming	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	,	 color 	 s 	 	,	 shape 	 s 	 	,	 form 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
in	spite	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	splendor	,	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	.
every	small	obstacle	,	every	 s 	 light 	 	 up 	 hill 	 	,	would	cause	these	 fellow 	 s 	 	to	stop	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 track 	 s 	 	and	give	up	.
so	we	had	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	going	on	.
i	found	out	that	they	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	time	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 frust 	 ration 	 	and	 difficult 	 ies 	 	--	not	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 physical 	 ly 	 	 un 	 fit 	 	.
but	that	's	one	reason	why	they	 end 	 ed 	 	up	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
and	i	 be 	 came 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	more	and	more	 agit 	 ated 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	there	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	be	with	them	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	ride	and	create	a	team	and	i	did	n't	know	what	to	do	.
now	,	let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
we	're	going	 down 	 hill 	 	in	some	 rock 	 y 	 	 terra 	 in 	 	,	and	the	front	tire	of	alex	 get 	 s 	 	caught	in	one	of	these	 crevasse 	 s 	 	here	.
so	he	 crash 	 es 	 	down	,	and	he	 get 	 s 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 inju 	 red 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	prevent	him	from	 jump 	 ing 	 	up	and	then	 start 	 ing 	 	to	jump	up	and	down	on	his	bike	and	curse	 violent 	 ly 	 	.
then	he	 throw 	 s 	 	his	helmet	in	the	air	.
his	 back 	 pack 	 	 go 	 es 	 	 ball 	 istic 	 	in	some	other	direction	.
and	then	he	 run 	 s 	 	to	the	 near 	 est 	 	tree	and	 start 	 s 	 	to	break	 branch 	 es 	 	and	throw	 rock 	 s 	 	and	curse	like	i	've	never	heard	.
and	i	'm	just	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	scene	with	a	complete	 dis 	 belief 	 	,	not	 know 	 ing 	 	what	to	do	.
i	'm	used	to	 algorithm 	 s 	 	and	data	 structure 	 s 	 	and	super	 motiv 	 ated 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	my	 back 	 ground 	 	prepared	me	to	deal	with	a	 rag 	 ing 	 	,	violent	adolescent	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	.
and	you	have	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	these	 incident 	 s 	 	did	not	happen	in	convenient	 location 	 s 	 	.
they	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	the	judean	desert	,	20	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	from	the	 near 	 est 	 	road	.
and	what	you	do	n't	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	that	 some 	 where 	 	between	these	 rider 	 s 	 	there	,	there	's	a	teenager	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	rock	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	'm	not	moving	from	here	.	forget	it	.
i	've	had	it	.	``
well	,	that	's	a	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	you	have	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	guy	moving	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	dark	soon	and	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
it	took	me	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 incident 	 s 	 	to	figure	out	what	i	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	.
at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	it	was	a	disaster	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	harsh	 word 	 s 	 	and	 threat 	 s 	 	and	they	took	me	 no 	 where 	 	.
that	's	what	they	had	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	at	some	point	i	found	out	,	when	a	kid	like	 th 	 is 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	fit	,	the	best	thing	that	you	can	possibly	do	is	stay	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	possible	to	 th 	 is 	 	kid	,	which	is	difficult	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	do	is	go	away	.
but	that	's	what	he	had	all	his	life	,	people	 walk 	 ing 	 	away	from	him	.
so	what	you	have	to	do	is	stay	close	and	try	to	reach	in	and	pet	his	shoulder	or	give	him	a	piece	of	chocolate	.
so	i	would	say	,	``	alex	,	i	know	that	it	's	 terr 	 ibly 	 	difficult	.
why	do	n't	you	rest	for	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	and	then	we	'll	go	on	.	``
``	go	away	you	maniac	-	psychopath	.
why	would	you	 br 	 ing 	 	us	to	 th 	 is 	 	 god 	 damn 	 	place	?	``
and	i	would	say	,	``	relax	,	alex	.
here	's	a	piece	of	chocolate	.	``
and	alex	would	go	,	``	arrrrggg	!	``
 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	understand	that	on	these	 ride 	 s 	 	we	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	--	and	after	the	 ride 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
and	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	alex	,	to	begin	with	?
he	's	a	17	-	year	-	old	.
when	he	was	eight	,	 some 	 one 	 	put	him	on	a	boat	in	odessa	and	 s 	 ent 	 	him	,	 ship 	 ped 	 	him	to	israel	on	his	own	.
and	he	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	south	tel	aviv	and	did	not	have	the	good	luck	to	be	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	by	a	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	and	 roam 	 ed 	 	the	 street 	 s 	 	and	 be 	 came 	 	a	prominent	gang	member	.
and	he	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	his	life	in	two	 place 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	and	the	state	 pri 	 son 	 	,	where	he	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	before	he	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	rock	there	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	kid	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	 abuse 	 d 	 	,	 abandon 	 ed 	 	,	 ignor 	 ed 	 	,	 betray 	 ed 	 	by	 al 	 most 	 	every	adult	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
so	,	for	 s 	 uch 	 	a	kid	,	when	an	adult	that	he	 learn 	 s 	 	to	respect	 stay 	 s 	 	close	to	him	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	walk	away	from	him	in	any	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 ir 	 respect 	 ive 	 	of	how	he	 behav 	 es 	 	,	it	's	a	tremendous	 heal 	 ing 	 	experience	.
it	's	an	act	of	 un 	 condition 	 al 	 	 accept 	 ance 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	he	never	had	.
i	want	to	say	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	about	vision	.
when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	program	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	original	plan	of	creating	a	team	of	winning	 under 	 dog 	 s 	 	.
i	had	an	image	of	lance	armstrong	in	my	mind	.
and	it	took	me	 exact 	 ly 	 	two	 month 	 s 	 	of	complete	 frust 	 ration 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	vision	was	 mis 	 place 	 d 	 	,	and	that	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	vision	 suprem 	 e 	 ly 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	and	more	 read 	 ily 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
it	all	of	a	sudden	 dawn 	 ed 	 	on	me	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	that	the	purpose	of	these	 ride 	 s 	 	should	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	to	 ex 	 pose 	 	the	 kid 	 s 	 	to	one	thing	 on 	 ly 	 	:	love	.
love	to	the	country	,	to	the	 up 	 hill 	 	and	the	 down 	 hill 	 	,	to	all	the	 in 	 credible 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	that	surround	us	--	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	the	 plant 	 s 	 	,	the	 insect 	 s 	 	--	love	and	respect	to	other	fellow	 member 	 s 	 	in	your	team	,	in	your	 bi 	 king 	 	team	,	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	love	and	respect	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	 bad 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 s 	 	.
together	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	went	through	a	 remark 	 able 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
now	,	i	come	from	a	 cut 	 throat 	 	world	of	science	and	high	technology	.
i	used	to	think	that	reason	and	logic	and	 relent 	 less 	 	drive	 we 	 re 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	ways	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
and	before	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	that	i	did	with	them	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	that	i	did	with	 my 	 self 	 	,	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	perfect	,	ideal	,	optimal	,	but	after	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	for	some	time	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	great	 virtue 	 s 	 	of	 empath 	 y 	 	and	 flex 	 ibility 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	start	with	some	vision	,	and	if	the	vision	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	well	 noth 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
all	you	have	to	do	is	play	with	it	,	change	it	a	little	bit	,	and	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	help	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	work	.
so	right	now	,	i	feel	more	like	these	are	my	 principle 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	do	n't	like	them	,	i	have	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	these	 principle 	 s 	 	is	focus	.
before	each	ride	we	 s 	 it 	 	together	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	we	give	them	one	word	to	think	about	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	ride	.
you	have	to	focus	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	on	 some 	 thing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
so	these	are	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	 team 	 work 	 	``	or	``	 endur 	 ance 	 	``	or	even	 complic 	 ated 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	like	``	resource	 al 	 location 	 	``	or	``	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	``	a	word	that	they	do	n't	understand	.
you	know	,	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	is	one	of	these	 critical 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	life	-	 cop 	 ing 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	that	mountain	 bi 	 king 	 	can	 re 	 ally 	 	teach	you	.
i	tell	 kid 	 s 	 	when	they	struggle	through	some	 up 	 hill 	 	and	feel	like	they	can	not	take	it	 any 	 more 	 	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	to	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	 im 	 mediate 	 	 obstacle 	 s 	 	and	raise	your	head	and	look	around	and	see	how	the	vista	around	you	 grow 	 s 	 	.
it	 liter 	 ally 	 	 propel 	 s 	 	you	 up 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	is	all	about	.
or	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	look	back	in	time	and	 real 	 ize 	 	that	you	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 conquer 	 ed 	 	 steep 	 er 	 	 mountain 	 s 	 	before	.
and	that	's	how	they	develop	self	-	esteem	.
now	,	let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
you	stand	with	your	bike	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	february	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	,	and	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	one	of	these	 rain 	 y 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 drizzl 	 ing 	 	and	cold	and	 chill 	 y 	 	,	and	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	,	let	's	say	,	yokneam	.
and	you	look	up	at	the	sky	through	a	hole	in	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	you	see	the	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	at	the	top	of	the	muhraka	--	that	's	where	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	climb	now	--	and	you	say	,	``	there	's	no	way	that	i	could	possibly	get	there	.	``
and	yet	,	two	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	roof	of	 th 	 is 	 	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	,	 smear 	 ed 	 	with	mud	,	blood	and	sweat	.
and	you	look	down	at	yokneam	;	 every 	 thing 	 	is	so	small	and	 tin 	 y 	 	.
and	you	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	alex	.	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	where	we	 start 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	that	big	.
i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	i	did	it	.	``
and	that	's	the	point	when	you	start	loving	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	so	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	these	special	 word 	 s 	 	that	we	teach	them	.
and	at	the	end	of	each	ride	,	we	 s 	 it 	 	together	and	share	 moment 	 s 	 	in	which	 t 	 hose 	 	special	 word 	 s 	 	of	the	day	 pop 	 ped 	 	up	and	made	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	these	 discuss 	 ions 	 	can	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	inspiring	.
in	one	of	them	,	one	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 rid 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	ridge	 overlook 	 ing 	 	the	dead	sea	--	and	he	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	spot	here	--	``	i	was	 re 	 minded 	 	of	the	day	when	i	left	my	village	in	ethiopia	and	went	away	together	with	my	brother	.
we	 walk 	 ed 	 	120	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	we	 reach 	 ed 	 	sudan	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	place	where	we	got	some	water	and	 suppli 	 es 	 	.	``
and	he	 go 	 es 	 	on	 say 	 ing 	 	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	 look 	 s 	 	at	him	like	a	hero	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	for	the	first	time	in	his	life	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	 volunteer 	 s 	 	 rid 	 ing 	 	with	me	,	 adult 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	him	--	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	our	 or 	 deal 	 	 un 	 til 	 	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	israel	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	now	,	``	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	understand	where	i	am	,	and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	it	.	``
now	i	remember	,	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	,	i	felt	 goose 	 bump 	 s 	 	on	my	body	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	 overlook 	 ing 	 	the	moab	 mountain 	 s 	 	here	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
that	's	where	joshua	 descend 	 ed 	 	and	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	jordan	and	led	the	people	of	israel	 in 	 to 	 	the	land	of	canaan	3,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	 th 	 is 	 	final	leg	of	the	journey	from	africa	.
and	so	,	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	and	 con 	 text 	 	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	play	key	 role 	 s 	 	in	the	way	i	plan	my	 ride 	 s 	 	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
