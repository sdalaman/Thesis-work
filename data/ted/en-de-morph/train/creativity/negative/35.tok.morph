well	,	i	thought	there	would	be	a	 pod 	 ium 	 	,	so	i	'm	a	bit	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
chris	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	tell	 aga 	 in 	 	how	we	found	the	structure	of	dna	.
and	since	,	you	know	,	i	follow	his	 order 	 s 	 	,	i	'll	do	it	.
but	it	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 bore 	 s 	 	me	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	wrote	a	book	.	so	i	'll	say	 some 	 thing 	 	--	--	i	'll	say	a	little	about	,	you	know	,	how	the	 discover 	 y 	 	was	made	,	and	why	francis	and	i	found	it	.
and	then	,	i	hope	 may 	 be 	 	i	have	at	 l 	 east 	 	five	 minute 	 s 	 	to	say	what	 make 	 s 	 	me	tick	now	.
in	back	of	me	is	a	picture	of	me	when	i	was	17	.
i	was	at	the	university	of	chicago	,	in	my	third	year	,	and	i	was	in	my	third	year	 be 	 cause 	 	the	university	of	chicago	let	you	in	after	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	high	school	.
so	you	--	it	was	 f 	 un 	 	to	get	away	from	high	school	--	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	and	i	was	no	good	in	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
but	i	should	say	that	my	 back 	 ground 	 	--	my	father	was	,	you	know	,	raised	to	be	an	episcopalian	and	republican	,	but	after	one	year	of	college	,	he	 be 	 came 	 	an	atheist	and	a	democrat	.
and	my	mother	was	irish	catholic	,	and	--	but	she	did	n't	take	 relig 	 ion 	 	too	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
and	by	the	age	of	11	,	i	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	going	to	sunday	mass	,	and	going	on	 bird 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 walk 	 s 	 	with	my	father	.
so	early	on	,	i	heard	of	charles	darwin	.
i	guess	,	you	know	,	he	was	the	big	hero	.
and	,	you	know	,	you	understand	life	 a 	 s 	 	it	now	 exist 	 s 	 	through	evolution	.
and	at	the	university	of	chicago	i	was	a	 zoo 	 logy 	 	major	,	and	thought	i	would	end	up	,	you	know	,	if	i	was	bright	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	a	ph.d.	from	cornell	in	 ornitho 	 logy 	 	.
then	,	in	the	chicago	paper	,	there	was	a	review	of	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	what	is	life	?	``	by	the	great	physicist	,	schrodinger	.
and	that	,	of	course	,	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	question	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	.
you	know	,	darwin	 explain 	 ed 	 	life	after	it	got	 start 	 ed 	 	,	but	what	was	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	life	?
and	schrodinger	 s 	 aid 	 	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	was	information	present	in	our	 chromosom 	 es 	 	,	and	it	had	to	be	present	on	a	molecule	.	i	'd	never	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	before	.
you	know	 chromosom 	 es 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	molecule	,	and	 some 	 how 	 	all	the	information	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	present	in	some	digital	form	.	and	there	was	the	big	question	of	,	how	did	you	copy	the	information	?
so	that	was	the	book	.	and	so	,	from	that	moment	on	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 genetic 	 ist 	 	--	understand	the	gene	and	,	through	that	,	understand	life	.
so	i	had	,	you	know	,	a	hero	at	a	distance	.
it	was	n't	a	 base 	 ball 	 	player	;	it	was	linus	pauling	.
and	so	i	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	caltech	and	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	me	down	.
so	i	went	to	indiana	,	which	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	caltech	in	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	and	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	,	they	had	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 basket 	 ball 	 	team	.
so	i	had	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	happy	life	at	indiana	.
and	it	was	at	indiana	i	got	the	impression	that	,	you	know	,	the	gene	was	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	dna	.
and	so	when	i	got	my	ph.d.	,	i	should	go	and	search	for	dna	.
so	i	first	went	to	copenhagen	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	could	 be 	 come 	 	a	 bio 	 chemist 	 	,	but	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	 bio 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	n't	going	 any 	 where 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	,	you	know	,	 say 	 ing 	 	what	the	gene	was	;	it	was	just	nuclear	science	.	and	oh	,	that	's	the	book	,	little	book	.
you	can	read	it	in	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	.
and	--	but	then	i	went	to	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	in	italy	.
and	there	was	an	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	speaker	who	was	n't	on	the	program	,	and	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	dna	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	maurice	wilkins	.	he	was	trained	 a 	 s 	 	a	physicist	,	and	after	the	war	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 bio 	 physics 	 	,	and	he	 pick 	 ed 	 	dna	 be 	 cause 	 	dna	had	 be 	 en 	 	 determine 	 d 	 	at	the	rockefeller	institute	to	possibly	be	the	genetic	 molecule 	 s 	 	on	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
most	people	 believ 	 ed 	 	it	was	 protein 	 s 	 	.
but	wilkins	,	you	know	,	thought	dna	was	the	best	bet	,	and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	x	-	ray	photograph	.
sort	of	 crystall 	 ine 	 	.	so	dna	had	a	structure	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 ow 	 ed 	 	it	to	 prob 	 ably 	 	different	 molecule 	 s 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	different	 set 	 s 	 	of	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.
so	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	universal	about	the	dna	molecule	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	work	with	him	,	but	he	did	n't	want	a	 form 	 er 	 	 bird 	 watch 	 er 	 	,	and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	cambridge	,	england	.
so	i	went	to	cambridge	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	best	place	in	the	world	then	for	x	-	ray	 crystall 	 ography 	 	.	and	x	-	ray	 crystall 	 ography 	 	is	now	a	subject	in	,	you	know	,	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 depart 	 ments 	 	.
i	mean	,	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	it	was	the	domain	of	the	 physicist 	 s 	 	.
so	the	best	place	for	x	-	ray	 crystall 	 ography 	 	was	at	the	cavendish	 labor 	 atory 	 	at	cambridge	.
and	there	i	met	francis	crick	.
i	went	there	 with 	 out 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	him	.	he	was	35.	i	was	23	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	a	day	,	we	had	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	we	could	take	a	 short 	 cut 	 	to	 find 	 ing 	 	the	structure	of	dna	.
not	solve	it	like	,	you	know	,	in	 rigor 	 ous 	 	fashion	,	but	build	a	model	,	an	electro	-	model	,	using	some	 coordinate 	 s 	 	of	,	you	know	,	length	,	all	that	sort	of	stuff	from	x	-	ray	 photograph 	 s 	 	.
but	just	ask	what	the	molecule	--	how	should	it	fold	up	?
and	the	reason	for	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	at	the	center	of	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	,	is	linus	pauling	.	about	six	 month 	 s 	 	before	,	he	 pro 	 posed 	 	the	alpha	 hel 	 ical 	 	structure	for	 protein 	 s 	 	.	and	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	he	 banish 	 ed 	 	the	man	out	on	the	right	,	 s 	 ir 	 	lawrence	bragg	,	who	was	the	cavendish	professor	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	bragg	had	cause	to	 s 	 mile 	 	.
he	 certain 	 ly 	 	was	n't	 smil 	 ing 	 	when	i	got	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	 some 	 what 	 	 humil 	 iated 	 	by	pauling	 get 	 ting 	 	the	alpha	 hel 	 ix 	 	,	and	the	cambridge	people	 fail 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 chemist 	 s 	 	.
and	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	 n 	 either 	 	crick	or	i	 we 	 re 	 	 chemist 	 s 	 	,	so	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	build	a	model	.	and	he	 k 	 new 	 	,	francis	 k 	 new 	 	wilkins	.
so	wilkins	 s 	 aid 	 	he	thought	it	was	the	 hel 	 ix 	 	.
x	-	ray	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	he	thought	was	 compar 	 able 	 	with	the	 hel 	 ix 	 	.
so	we	built	a	three	-	 strand 	 ed 	 	model	.
the	people	from	london	came	up	.
wilkins	and	 th 	 is 	 	 collabor 	 ator 	 	,	or	possible	 collabor 	 ator 	 	,	rosalind	franklin	,	came	up	and	sort	of	 laugh 	 ed 	 	at	our	model	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	 lous 	 y 	 	,	and	it	was	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	told	to	build	no	more	 model 	 s 	 	;	we	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 compete 	 nt 	 	.
and	so	we	did	n't	build	any	 model 	 s 	 	,	and	francis	sort	of	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	work	on	 protein 	 s 	 	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	did	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	and	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	read	.
you	know	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 read 	 ing 	 	is	a	good	thing	;	you	get	 fact 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	people	in	london	that	linus	pauling	's	going	to	move	on	to	dna	.
if	dna	is	that	 import 	 ant 	 	,	linus	will	know	it	.
he	'll	build	a	model	,	and	then	we	're	going	to	be	 scoop 	 ed 	 	.
and	,	in	fact	,	he	'd	written	the	people	in	london	:	could	he	see	 the 	 ir 	 	x	-	ray	photograph	?
and	they	had	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	to	say	``	no.	``	so	he	did	n't	have	it	.
but	there	was	 one 	 s 	 	in	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	linus	did	n't	look	at	them	that	 care 	 fully 	 	.
but	about	,	oh	,	15	 month 	 s 	 	after	i	got	to	cambridge	,	a	rumor	 beg 	 an 	 	to	appear	from	linus	pauling	's	son	,	who	was	in	cambridge	,	that	his	father	was	now	 work 	 ing 	 	on	dna	.
and	so	,	one	day	peter	came	in	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	was	peter	pauling	,	and	he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	copy	of	his	father	's	 man 	 u 	 script 	 s 	 	.
and	boy	,	i	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	,	you	know	,	we	may	be	 scoop 	 ed 	 	.
i	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	no	 qual 	 ification 	 s 	 	for	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	so	there	was	the	paper	,	and	he	 pro 	 posed 	 	a	three	-	 strand 	 ed 	 	structure	.
and	i	read	it	,	and	it	was	just	--	it	was	crap	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	you	know	,	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	from	the	world	's	--	--	and	so	,	it	was	held	together	by	hydrogen	 bond 	 s 	 	between	 phosp 	 hate 	 	 group 	 s 	 	.
well	,	if	the	peak	ph	that	 cell 	 s 	 	have	is	around	seven	,	 t 	 hose 	 	hydrogen	 bond 	 s 	 	could	n't	exist	.
we	 rush 	 ed 	 	over	to	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	could	pauling	be	right	?	``	and	alex	hust	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no.	``	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	happy	.
and	,	you	know	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	still	in	the	game	,	but	we	 we 	 re 	 	 frighten 	 ed 	 	that	 some 	 body 	 	at	caltech	would	tell	linus	that	he	was	wrong	.
and	so	bragg	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	build	 model 	 s 	 	.	``
and	a	month	after	we	got	the	pauling	 man 	 u 	 script 	 	--	i	should	say	i	took	the	 man 	 u 	 script 	 	to	london	,	and	 show 	 ed 	 	the	people	.
well	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	linus	was	wrong	and	that	we	're	still	in	the	game	and	that	they	should	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	start	building	 model 	 s 	 	.
but	wilkins	 s 	 aid 	 	``	no.	``	rosalind	franklin	was	 leav 	 ing 	 	in	about	two	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	after	she	left	he	would	start	building	 model 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	came	back	with	that	news	to	cambridge	,	and	bragg	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	build	 model 	 s 	 	.	``
well	,	of	course	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	 model 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	a	picture	of	rosalind	.	she	 re 	 ally 	 	,	you	know	,	in	one	sense	she	was	a	chemist	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	she	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	trained	--	she	did	n't	know	any	 organ 	 ic 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	or	 quant 	 um 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
she	was	a	 crystall 	 ographer 	 	.
and	i	think	part	of	the	reason	she	did	n't	want	to	build	 model 	 s 	 	was	,	she	was	n't	a	chemist	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	pauling	was	a	chemist	.
and	so	crick	and	i	,	you	know	,	 start 	 ed 	 	building	 model 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'd	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	little	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	but	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
well	,	we	got	the	answer	on	the	28th	february	'53	.
and	it	was	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	rule	,	which	,	to	me	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	rule	:	never	be	the	 bright 	 est 	 	person	in	a	room	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	the	best	 chemist 	 s 	 	in	the	room	.
i	went	in	and	 show 	 ed 	 	them	a	 pair 	 ing 	 	i	'd	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	jerry	donohue	--	he	was	a	chemist	--	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	wrong	.
you	've	got	--	the	hydrogen	 atom 	 s 	 	are	in	the	wrong	place	.
i	just	put	them	down	like	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	 book 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	wrong	.
so	the	next	day	,	you	know	,	after	i	thought	,	``	well	,	he	might	be	right	.	``
so	i	 change 	 d 	 	the	 location 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	found	the	base	 pair 	 ing 	 	,	and	francis	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	the	 chain 	 s 	 	run	in	absolute	 direction 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 k 	 new 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	right	.
so	it	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	,	you	know	,	it	all	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	.
from	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	thing	.
and	we	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	big	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	if	you	just	put	a	next	to	t	and	g	next	to	c	,	you	have	a	 copy 	 ing 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
so	we	saw	how	genetic	information	is	carried	.
it	's	the	order	of	the	four	 base 	 s 	 	.
so	in	a	sense	,	it	is	a	sort	of	digital	-	type	information	.
and	you	copy	it	by	going	from	strand	-	 separat 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	you	know	,	if	it	did	n't	work	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	you	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	did	n't	have	any	other	scheme	.
but	that	's	not	the	way	most	 scientist 	 s 	 	think	.
most	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	dull	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	wo	n't	think	about	it	 un 	 til 	 	we	know	it	's	right	.
but	,	you	know	,	we	thought	,	well	,	it	's	at	 l 	 east 	 	95	percent	right	or	99	percent	right	.
so	think	about	it	.	the	next	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	five	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	to	our	work	in	``	nature	``	--	 non 	 e 	 	.
and	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	left	by	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	the	last	part	of	the	 tri 	 o 	 	:	how	do	you	--	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	genetic	information	do	?
it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	obvious	that	it	 provide 	 d 	 	the	information	to	an	rna	molecule	,	and	then	how	do	you	go	from	rna	to	protein	?
for	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	we	just	--	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	solve	the	structure	of	rna	.
it	did	n't	yield	.	it	did	n't	give	good	x	-	ray	 photograph 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 decide 	 d 	 ly 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	;	a	girl	did	n't	marry	me	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	,	you	know	,	sort	of	a	 shit 	 ty 	 	time	.
so	there	's	a	picture	of	francis	and	i	before	i	met	the	girl	,	so	i	'm	still	looking	happy	.
but	there	is	what	we	did	when	we	did	n't	know	where	to	go	forward	:	we	 form 	 ed 	 	a	club	and	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	rna	tie	club	.
george	gamow	,	 al 	 so 	 	a	great	physicist	,	he	designed	the	tie	.
he	was	one	of	the	 member 	 s 	 	.	the	question	was	:	how	do	you	go	from	a	four	-	letter	code	to	the	20	-	letter	code	of	 protein 	 s 	 	?
feynman	was	a	member	,	and	teller	,	and	 friend 	 s 	 	of	gamow	.
but	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	--	no	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 photograph 	 ed 	 	twice	.
and	on	both	 occasion 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	one	of	us	was	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	tie	.
there	's	francis	up	on	the	upper	right	,	and	alex	rich	--	the	m.d	.	-	 turn 	 ed 	 	-	 crystall 	 ographer 	 	--	is	next	to	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	taken	in	cambridge	in	september	of	1955	.
and	i	'm	 smil 	 ing 	 	,	sort	of	 force 	 d 	 	,	i	think	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	girl	i	had	,	boy	,	she	was	gone	.
and	so	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	get	happy	 un 	 til 	 	1960	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	we	found	out	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	you	know	,	that	there	are	three	 form 	 s 	 	of	rna	.
and	we	 k 	 new 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	dna	 provide 	 s 	 	the	information	for	rna	.
rna	 provide 	 s 	 	the	information	for	protein	.
and	that	let	marshall	nirenberg	,	you	know	,	take	rna	--	synthetic	rna	--	put	it	in	a	system	making	protein	.	he	made	 polyp 	 hen 	 y 	 l 	 alanine 	 	,	 polyp 	 hen 	 y 	 l 	 alanine 	 	.	so	that	's	the	first	 crack 	 ing 	 	of	the	genetic	code	,	and	it	was	all	over	by	1966	.
so	there	,	that	's	what	chris	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	,	it	was	--	so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	since	then	?
well	,	at	that	time	--	i	should	go	back	.
when	we	found	the	structure	of	dna	,	i	 g 	 ave 	 	my	first	talk	at	cold	spring	harbor	.	the	physicist	,	leo	szilard	,	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	are	you	going	to	patent	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	--	but	he	 k 	 new 	 	patent	law	,	and	that	we	could	n't	patent	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	could	n't	.	no	use	for	it	.
and	so	dna	did	n't	 be 	 come 	 	a	 use 	 ful 	 	molecule	,	and	the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	did	n't	enter	 in 	 to 	 	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	 un 	 til 	 	1973	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	boyer	and	cohen	in	san	francisco	and	stanford	came	up	with	 the 	 ir 	 	method	of	 recombi 	 nant 	 	dna	,	and	stanford	 patent 	 ed 	 	it	and	made	a	lot	of	money	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	they	 patent 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	,	you	know	,	could	do	 use 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	they	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	read	the	 letter 	 s 	 	for	the	code	.
and	,	boom	,	we	've	,	you	know	,	had	a	 bio 	 tech 	 	industry	.	and	,	but	we	 we 	 re 	 	still	a	long	ways	from	,	you	know	,	 answer 	 ing 	 	a	question	which	sort	of	 dominate 	 d 	 	my	 child 	 hood 	 	,	which	is	:	how	do	you	nature	-	nurture	?
and	so	i	'll	go	on	.	i	'm	 al 	 ready 	 	out	of	time	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	michael	wigler	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	physicist	.	and	he	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 techni 	 que 	 	which	 essential 	 ly 	 	will	let	us	look	at	 s 	 ample 	 	dna	and	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	a	million	 spot 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	it	.
there	's	a	chip	there	,	a	 convention 	 al 	 	one	.	then	there	's	one	made	by	a	 photo 	 lith 	 ography 	 	by	a	company	in	madison	 call 	 ed 	 	nimblegen	,	which	is	way	 a 	 head 	 	of	affymetrix	.
and	we	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	.
and	what	you	can	do	is	sort	of	 compar 	 e 	 	dna	of	normal	 s 	 e 	 g 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	cancer	.
and	you	can	see	on	the	top	that	 cancer 	 s 	 	which	are	bad	show	 insert 	 ions 	 	or	 delet 	 ions 	 	.
so	the	dna	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	 muck 	 ed 	 	up	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	have	a	chance	of	 surviv 	 ing 	 	,	the	dna	is	n't	so	 muck 	 ed 	 	up	.
so	we	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	lead	to	what	we	call	``	dna	 bio 	 psies 	 	.	``	before	you	get	 treat 	 ed 	 	for	cancer	,	you	should	 re 	 ally 	 	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	,	and	get	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	the	face	of	the	 ene 	 my 	 	.
it	's	not	a	--	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	partial	look	,	but	it	's	a	--	i	think	it	's	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
so	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	breast	cancer	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	money	for	it	,	no	government	money	.
and	now	i	have	a	sort	of	 vest 	 ed 	 	interest	:	i	want	to	do	it	for	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	.	so	,	you	know	,	you	are	n't	 treat 	 ed 	 	if	it	's	not	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
but	wigler	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	looking	at	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	normal	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	made	a	 re 	 ally 	 	sort	of	surprising	 observ 	 ation 	 	.
which	is	,	all	of	us	have	about	10	 place 	 s 	 	in	our	genome	where	we	've	lost	a	gene	or	 gain 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
so	we	're	sort	of	all	 im 	 perfect 	 	.	and	the	question	is	well	,	if	we	're	around	here	,	you	know	,	these	little	 loss 	 es 	 	or	 gain 	 s 	 	might	not	be	too	bad	.
but	if	these	 delet 	 ions 	 	or	 ampl 	 ification 	 s 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	in	the	wrong	gene	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	'll	feel	sick	.
so	the	first	disease	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	is	 aut 	 ism 	 	.
and	the	reason	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 aut 	 ism 	 	is	we	had	the	money	to	do	it	.
looking	at	an	individual	is	about	3,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	and	the	parent	of	a	child	with	asperger	's	disease	,	the	high	-	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 aut 	 ism 	 	,	had	 s 	 ent 	 	his	thing	to	a	 convention 	 al 	 	company	;	they	did	n't	do	it	.
could	n't	do	it	by	 convention 	 al 	 	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	but	just	 s 	 canning 	 	it	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	find	 gene 	 s 	 	for	 aut 	 ism 	 	.
and	you	can	see	here	,	there	are	a	lot	of	them	.
so	a	lot	of	 aut 	 istic 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 aut 	 istic 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	just	lost	a	big	piece	of	dna	.
i	mean	,	big	piece	at	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	level	.
we	saw	one	 aut 	 istic 	 	kid	,	about	five	million	 base 	 s 	 	just	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	from	one	of	his	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
we	have	n't	yet	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 parent 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 parent 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	n't	have	that	loss	,	or	they	would	n't	be	 parent 	 s 	 	.
now	,	so	,	our	 aut 	 ism 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	is	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	.	we	got	three	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
i	think	it	will	cost	at	 l 	 east 	 	10	to	20	before	you	'd	be	in	a	position	to	help	 parent 	 s 	 	who	've	had	an	 aut 	 istic 	 	child	,	or	think	they	may	have	an	 aut 	 istic 	 	child	,	and	can	we	spot	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	same	 techni 	 que 	 	should	 prob 	 ably 	 	look	at	all	.
it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	to	find	 gene 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	i	'll	conclude	by	 say 	 ing 	 	we	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	20	people	with	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	.
and	we	thought	we	'd	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	to	look	at	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	before	we	got	the	picture	.	but	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	there	's	seven	out	of	20	had	a	change	which	was	 ver 	 y 	 	high	.
and	yet	,	in	the	 control 	 s 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	three	.
so	what	's	the	meaning	of	the	 control 	 s 	 	?
 we 	 re 	 	they	crazy	 al 	 so 	 	,	and	we	did	n't	know	it	?
or	,	you	know	,	 we 	 re 	 	they	normal	?	i	would	guess	they	're	normal	.
and	what	we	think	in	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	is	there	are	 gene 	 s 	 	of	 pre 	 dispos 	 ure 	 	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	that	 pre 	 dispos 	 es 	 	--	and	then	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	sub	-	segment	of	the	population	that	's	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	schizophrenic	.
now	,	we	do	n't	have	 re 	 ally 	 	any	evidence	of	it	,	but	i	think	,	to	give	you	a	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	,	the	best	guess	is	that	if	you	're	left	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	,	you	're	prone	to	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	.
30	percent	of	schizophrenic	people	are	left	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	,	and	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	funny	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	60	percent	of	the	people	are	 genetic 	 ally 	 	left	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	half	of	it	 show 	 ed 	 	.	i	do	n't	have	the	time	to	say	.
now	,	some	people	who	think	they	're	right	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	are	 genetic 	 ally 	 	left	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	.	ok	.	i	'm	just	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	if	you	think	,	oh	,	i	do	n't	carry	a	left	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	gene	so	 there 	 fore 	 	my	,	you	know	,	children	wo	n't	be	at	risk	of	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	.	you	might	.	ok	?
so	it	's	,	to	me	,	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	time	.
we	ought	to	be	able	to	find	the	gene	for	 bi 	 polar 	 	;	there	's	a	relationship	.
and	if	i	had	 en 	 ough 	 	money	,	we	'd	find	them	all	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
i	thank	you	.
