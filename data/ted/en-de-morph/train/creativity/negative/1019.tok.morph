i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	share	with	you	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	journey	--	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 reward 	 ing 	 	journey	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	which	 br 	 ought 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	training	 rat 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	human	 live 	 s 	 	by	 detect 	 ing 	 	 land 	 mine 	 s 	 	and	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	i	had	two	 pass 	 ions 	 	.
one	was	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	 rod 	 ent 	 s 	 	.
i	had	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 rat 	 s 	 	,	 mic 	 e 	 	,	 ham 	 sters 	 	,	gerbils	,	 squirrel 	 s 	 	.
you	name	it	,	i	 br 	 ed 	 	it	,	and	i	 s 	 old 	 	them	to	pet	 shop 	 s 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	had	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	africa	.
growing	up	in	a	 multi 	 cultural 	 	environment	,	we	had	african	 student 	 s 	 	in	the	house	,	and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	so	different	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	,	 depend 	 ency 	 	on	 import 	 ed 	 	know	-	how	,	 good 	 s 	 	,	 service 	 s 	 	,	 ex 	 uber 	 ant 	 	cultural	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
africa	was	 tru 	 ly 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	for	me	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	an	industrial	engineer	,	engineer	in	product	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	and	i	focused	on	appropriate	 detect 	 ion 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	first	appropriate	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	industry	,	but	i	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	a	material	consumer	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	a	linear	,	 ex 	 tract 	 ing 	 	and	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	mode	.
i	quit	my	job	to	focus	on	the	real	world	problem	:	 land 	 mine 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	'95	now	.
 prince 	 s 	 s 	 	diana	is	 announc 	 ing 	 	on	tv	that	 land 	 mine 	 s 	 	form	a	structural	 bar 	 rier 	 	to	any	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	true	.
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	are	there	,	or	there	is	 s 	 us 	 pic 	 ion 	 	of	 land 	 mine 	 s 	 	,	you	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	enter	 in 	 to 	 	the	land	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	there	was	an	appeal	 world 	 wide 	 	for	new	 detect 	 ors 	 	in	the	 sustain 	 able 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	where	they	're	 need 	 ed 	 	to	produce	,	which	is	 main 	 ly 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
we	chose	 rat 	 s 	 	.
why	would	you	 choos 	 e 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	,	are	n't	they	 ver 	 min 	 	?
well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	are	,	in	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	what	most	people	think	about	them	,	 rat 	 s 	 	are	 high 	 ly 	 	 soci 	 able 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	our	product	--	what	you	see	here	.
there	's	a	target	 some 	 where 	 	here	.
you	see	an	 oper 	 ator 	 	,	a	trained	african	with	his	 rat 	 s 	 	in	front	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	left	and	right	.
there	,	the	animal	 find 	 s 	 	a	mine	.
it	 scratch 	 es 	 	on	the	 s 	 oil 	 	.
and	the	animal	 come 	 s 	 	back	for	a	food	reward	.
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	environment	.
here	,	the	animal	 get 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	food	reward	.
and	that	's	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
now	why	would	you	use	 rat 	 s 	 	?
 rat 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	used	since	the	'50s	last	century	,	in	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
 rat 	 s 	 	have	more	genetic	material	 al 	 locate 	 d 	 	to	 ol 	 fact 	 ion 	 	than	any	other	mammal	species	.
they	're	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	sensitive	to	smell	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	they	have	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	to	map	all	these	 smell 	 s 	 	and	to	communicate	about	it	.
now	how	do	we	communicate	with	 rat 	 s 	 	?
well	do	n't	talk	rat	,	but	we	have	a	 click 	 er 	 	,	a	standard	method	for	animal	training	,	which	you	see	there	.
a	 click 	 er 	 	,	which	 make 	 s 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	sound	with	which	you	can	reinforce	 part 	 icular 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	we	associate	the	click	sound	with	a	food	reward	,	which	is	 s 	 mash 	 ed 	 	banana	and	 peanut 	 s 	 	together	in	a	syringe	.
once	the	animal	 know 	 s 	 	click	,	food	,	click	,	food	,	click	,	food	--	so	click	is	food	--	we	 br 	 ing 	 	it	in	a	cage	with	a	hole	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	animal	 learn 	 s 	 	to	stick	the	nose	in	the	hole	under	which	a	target	 s 	 cent 	 	is	 place 	 d 	 	,	and	to	do	that	for	five	 second 	 s 	 	--	five	 second 	 s 	 	,	which	is	long	for	a	rat	.
once	the	animal	 know 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	make	the	task	a	bit	more	difficult	.
it	 learn 	 s 	 	how	to	find	the	target	smell	in	a	cage	with	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	,	up	to	10	 hole 	 s 	 	.
then	the	animal	 learn 	 s 	 	to	walk	on	a	leash	in	the	open	and	find	 target 	 s 	 	.
in	the	next	step	,	 animal 	 s 	 	learn	to	find	real	 mine 	 s 	 	in	real	 mine 	 field 	 s 	 	.
they	are	tested	and	accredited	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 inter 	 national 	 	mine	action	 standard 	 s 	 	,	just	like	 dog 	 s 	 	have	to	pass	a	test	.
 th 	 is 	 	 consist 	 s 	 	of	400	square	 meter 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	number	of	 mine 	 s 	 	 place 	 d 	 	 blind 	 ly 	 	,	and	the	team	of	 train 	 er 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	rat	have	to	find	all	the	 target 	 s 	 	.
if	the	animal	 do 	 es 	 	that	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	a	 licens 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	accredited	animal	to	be	 operation 	 al 	 	in	the	field	--	just	like	 dog 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	.
 may 	 be 	 	one	 s 	 light 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	:	we	can	train	 rat 	 s 	 	at	a	fifth	of	the	price	of	training	the	 min 	 ing 	 	dog	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	team	in	mozambique	:	one	tanzanian	 train 	 er 	 	,	who	 transfer 	 s 	 	the	 skill 	 s 	 	to	these	three	mozambican	 fellow 	 s 	 	.
and	you	should	see	the	 pri 	 de 	 	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	these	people	.
they	have	a	skill	,	which	 make 	 s 	 	them	much	less	dependent	on	foreign	aid	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	small	team	together	with	,	of	course	,	you	need	the	heavy	 vehicle 	 s 	 	and	the	manual	de	-	 min 	 ers 	 	to	follow	-	up	.
but	with	 th 	 is 	 	small	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	a	rat	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	we	have	 demonst 	 rated 	 	in	mozambique	that	we	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	cost	-	price	per	square	meter	up	to	60	percent	of	what	is	 current 	 ly 	 	normal	--	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	square	meter	,	we	do	it	at	$	1.18	,	and	we	can	still	 br 	 ing 	 	that	price	down	.
question	of	scale	.
if	you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	in	more	 rat 	 s 	 	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	the	 out 	 put 	 	even	 big 	 ger 	 	.
we	have	a	 demonst 	 ration 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	in	mozambique	.
eleven	african	 government 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 een 	 	that	they	can	 be 	 come 	 	less	dependent	by	using	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
they	have	 sign 	 ed 	 	the	pact	for	peace	and	 treat 	 y 	 	in	the	great	 lake 	 s 	 	region	,	and	they	endorse	hero	 rat 	 s 	 	to	clear	 the 	 ir 	 	common	 border 	 s 	 	of	 land 	 mine 	 s 	 	.
but	let	me	 br 	 ing 	 	you	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	problem	.
and	there	's	about	6,000	people	last	year	that	 walk 	 ed 	 	on	a	 land 	 mine 	 	,	but	 world 	 wide 	 	last	year	,	 al 	 most 	 	1.9	million	 di 	 ed 	 	from	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	first	cause	of	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	africa	where	t.b	.	and	hiv	are	 strong 	 ly 	 	linked	,	there	is	a	huge	common	problem	.
 micro 	 s 	 copy 	 	,	the	standard	who	procedure	,	 reach 	 es 	 	from	40	to	60	percent	 reli 	 ability 	 	.
in	tanzania	--	the	 number 	 s 	 	do	n't	lie	--	45	percent	of	people	--	t.b	.	 patient 	 s 	 	--	get	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	t.b	.	before	they	die	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	,	if	you	have	t.b	.	,	you	have	more	chance	that	you	wo	n't	be	 detect 	 ed 	 	,	but	will	just	die	from	t.b	.	 second 	 ary 	 	 infect 	 ions 	 	and	so	on	.
and	if	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	you	are	 detect 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	early	,	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	early	,	 treat 	 ment 	 	can	start	,	and	even	in	hiv	-	 positive 	 s 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	sense	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	cure	t.b	.	,	even	in	hiv	-	 positive 	 s 	 	.
so	in	our	common	language	,	dutch	,	the	name	for	t.b	.
is	``	tering	,	``	which	,	 etymo 	 logically 	 	,	 refer 	 s 	 	to	the	smell	of	tar	.
 al 	 ready 	 	the	old	chinese	and	the	greek	,	hippocrates	,	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	 document 	 ed 	 	,	that	t.b	.	can	be	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	based	on	the	 volatil 	 es 	 	 ex 	 ud 	 ing 	 	from	 patient 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	did	is	we	 collect 	 ed 	 	some	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	--	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 test 	 ing 	 	--	from	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	trained	 rat 	 s 	 	on	them	and	see	if	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	and	wonder	,	well	,	we	can	reach	89	percent	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	,	86	percent	 specific 	 ity 	 	using	 multi 	 ple 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	in	a	row	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	generic	technology	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	now	 explosive 	 s 	 	,	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	,	but	can	you	imagine	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	 any 	 thing 	 	under	there	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
you	have	a	cassette	with	10	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
you	put	these	10	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	at	once	in	the	cage	.
an	animal	 on 	 ly 	 	 need 	 s 	 	two	 hundred 	 th 	 s 	 	of	a	second	to	discriminate	the	 s 	 cent 	 	,	so	it	 go 	 es 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	fast	.
here	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	at	the	third	 s 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	positive	 s 	 ample 	 	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	a	click	sound	and	 come 	 s 	 	for	the	food	reward	.
and	by	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	,	we	can	have	like	a	second	-	line	opinion	to	see	which	 patient 	 s 	 	are	positive	,	which	are	negative	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	an	 indic 	 ation 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 micro 	 scopist 	 	can	process	40	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	in	a	day	,	a	rat	can	process	the	same	amount	of	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	in	seven	 minute 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	.
a	cage	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	a	cage	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	 provide 	 d 	 	that	you	have	 rat 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	now	 current 	 ly 	 	25	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	--	a	cage	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 oper 	 ating 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	day	,	can	process	1,680	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
can	you	imagine	the	potential	 off 	 spring 	 	 application 	 s 	 	--	 environment 	 al 	 	 detect 	 ion 	 	of	 pollutant 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	,	 custom 	 s 	 	 application 	 s 	 	,	 detect 	 ion 	 	of	 illi 	 cit 	 	 good 	 s 	 	in	 contain 	 ers 	 	and	so	on	.
but	let	's	stick	first	to	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	.
i	just	want	to	 brief 	 ly 	 	 high 	 light 	 	,	the	blue	 rod 	 s 	 	are	the	 score 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 s 	 copy 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	at	the	five	 clinic 	 s 	 	in	dar	es	salaam	on	a	population	of	500,000	people	,	where	15,000	 report 	 ed 	 	to	get	a	test	 d 	 one 	 	.
 micro 	 s 	 copy 	 	for	1,800	 patient 	 s 	 	.
and	by	just	 present 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	once	more	to	the	 rat 	 s 	 	and	 loop 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 result 	 s 	 	back	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 in 	 crease 	 	case	 detect 	 ion 	 	rates	by	over	30	percent	.
 through 	 out 	 	last	year	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	--	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	which	 inter 	 val 	 s 	 	you	take	--	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	increasing	case	 detect 	 ion 	 	rates	in	five	 hospital 	 s 	 	in	dar	es	salaam	between	30	and	40	percent	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 consider 	 able 	 	.
 know 	 ing 	 	that	a	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	patient	by	 micro 	 s 	 copy 	 	 infect 	 s 	 	up	to	15	people	,	 health 	 y 	 	people	,	per	year	,	you	can	be	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	have	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	our	hero	 rat 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	.
the	way	forward	for	us	is	now	to	 standard 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
and	there	are	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	we	have	a	small	laser	in	the	 sniff 	 er 	 	hole	where	the	animal	 ha 	 s 	 	to	stick	for	five	 second 	 s 	 	.
so	,	to	 standard 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	to	 standard 	 ize 	 	the	 pel 	 lets 	 	,	the	food	 reward 	 s 	 	,	and	to	semi	-	 autom 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	order	to	replicate	 th 	 is 	 	on	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	scale	and	affect	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	more	people	.
to	conclude	,	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	other	 application 	 s 	 	at	the	horizon	.
here	is	a	first	prototype	of	our	camera	rat	,	which	is	a	rat	with	a	rat	 back 	 pack 	 	with	a	camera	that	can	go	under	 rub 	 ble 	 	to	detect	for	 victim 	 s 	 	after	 earth 	 quake 	 	and	so	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	prototype	stage	.
we	do	n't	have	a	 work 	 ing 	 	system	here	yet	.
to	conclude	,	i	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	to	say	,	you	may	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 rat 	 s 	 	,	these	 project 	 s 	 	,	but	in	the	end	it	is	about	people	.
it	is	about	 empower 	 ing 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	to	tackle	difficult	,	expensive	and	 danger 	 ous 	 	 human 	 itarian 	 	 detect 	 ion 	 	 task 	 s 	 	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	that	with	a	local	resource	,	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
so	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	is	to	keep	on	 challeng 	 ing 	 	your	 per 	 ception 	 	about	the	 resource 	 s 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 	you	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	are	 environment 	 al 	 	,	 techno 	 logical 	 	,	animal	,	or	human	.
and	to	 respect 	 fully 	 	 harmon 	 ize 	 	with	them	in	order	to	foster	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	work	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
