namaste	.	good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	be	here	in	india	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	a	lot	about	what	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	over	these	last	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	11	 year 	 s 	 	with	v	-	day	and	``	the	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	,	``	 travel 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	women	and	 girl 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	planet	to	stop	violence	against	women	.
what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	cell	,	or	 group 	 ing 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	that	is	in	each	and	every	one	of	us	.
and	i	want	to	call	it	the	girl	cell	.
and	it	's	in	men	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	in	women	.
i	want	you	to	imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 group 	 ing 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	is	central	to	the	evolution	of	our	species	and	the	 continu 	 ation 	 	of	the	human	race	.
and	i	want	you	imagine	that	at	some	point	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	a	group	of	 power 	 ful 	 	people	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	 own 	 ing 	 	and	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	world	 under 	 stood 	 	that	the	 suppress 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	cell	,	the	 oppress 	 ion 	 	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	 re 	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	 under 	 min 	 ing 	 	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	us	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 weak 	 ness 	 	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	and	the	 crush 	 ing 	 	,	 eradic 	 ating 	 	,	 destroy 	 ing 	 	,	 reduc 	 ing 	 	these	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	the	process	of	 kill 	 ing 	 	off	the	girl	cell	,	which	was	,	by	the	way	,	 patriarch 	 y 	 	.
i	want	you	to	imagine	that	the	girl	is	a	chip	in	the	huge	 macro 	 cosm 	 	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
and	it	is	essential	to	balance	,	to	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	future	of	all	of	us	.
and	then	i	want	you	to	imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	girl	cell	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	it	's	 empath 	 y 	 	,	and	it	's	 pass 	 ion 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	it	's	 vulner 	 ability 	 	,	and	it	's	 open 	 ness 	 	,	and	it	's	 intens 	 ity 	 	,	and	it	's	 associ 	 ation 	 	,	and	it	's	relationship	,	and	it	is	intuitive	.
and	then	let	's	think	how	 compass 	 ion 	 	 inform 	 s 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	and	that	 vulner 	 ability 	 	is	our	 great 	 est 	 	strength	,	and	that	 emotion 	 s 	 	have	inherent	logic	,	which	lead	to	radical	,	appropriate	,	saving	action	.
and	then	let	's	remember	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	taught	the	exact	 oppos 	 ite 	 	by	the	 power 	 s 	 	that	be	,	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	your	 think 	 ing 	 	,	that	it	 get 	 s 	 	in	the	way	,	that	 vulner 	 ability 	 	is	 weak 	 ness 	 	,	that	 emotion 	 s 	 	are	not	to	be	 trust 	 ed 	 	,	and	you	're	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	take	 thing 	 s 	 	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	which	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	.
i	think	the	whole	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	up	not	to	be	a	girl	.
how	do	we	 br 	 ing 	 	up	 boy 	 s 	 	?	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	to	be	a	boy	?
to	be	a	boy	 re 	 ally 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	not	to	be	a	girl	.
to	be	a	man	 mean 	 s 	 	not	to	be	a	girl	.
to	be	a	woman	 mean 	 s 	 	not	to	be	a	girl	.
to	be	strong	 mean 	 s 	 	not	to	be	a	girl	.
to	be	a	 lead 	 er 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	not	to	be	a	girl	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	that	 be 	 ing 	 	a	girl	is	so	 power 	 ful 	 	that	we	've	had	to	train	 every 	 one 	 	not	to	be	that	.
and	i	'd	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	say	that	the	 iron 	 y 	 	of	course	,	is	that	 den 	 y 	 ing 	 	girl	,	 suppress 	 ing 	 	girl	,	 suppress 	 ing 	 	emotion	,	 re 	 fusing 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	lead	thus	here	.
where	we	have	now	come	to	live	in	a	world	where	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	violence	,	the	most	 horr 	 ific 	 	poverty	,	genocide	,	mass	 rape 	 s 	 	,	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	earth	,	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	out	of	control	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 suppress 	 ed 	 	our	girl	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 suppress 	 ed 	 	our	girl	-	ship	,	we	do	not	feel	what	is	going	on	.
so	,	we	are	not	 be 	 ing 	 	charged	with	the	 ad 	 equate 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	to	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
i	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 re 	 public 	 	of	congo	.
for	me	,	it	was	the	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	of	my	life	.
i	have	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	there	in	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	feel	up	to	that	point	i	had	 s 	 een 	 	a	lot	in	the	world	,	a	lot	of	violence	.
i	 essential 	 ly 	 	lived	in	the	rape	 mine 	 s 	 	of	the	world	for	the	last	12	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 re 	 public 	 	of	congo	 re 	 ally 	 	was	the	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	in	my	soul	.
i	went	and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	time	in	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	bukavu	in	a	hospital	 call 	 ed 	 	the	panzi	hospital	,	with	a	doctor	who	was	 a 	 s 	 	close	to	a	saint	 a 	 s 	 	any	person	i	've	ever	met	.
his	name	is	dr.	denis	mukwege	.
in	the	congo	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	know	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	war	 rag 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	12	 year 	 s 	 	,	a	war	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	six	million	people	.
it	is	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	 some 	 where 	 	between	300,000	and	500,000	women	have	 be 	 en 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	there	.
when	i	 s 	 pent 	 	my	first	 week 	 s 	 	at	panzi	hospital	i	 s 	 at 	 	with	women	who	 s 	 at 	 	and	lined	up	every	day	to	tell	me	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	 horr 	 ific 	 	,	and	so	mind	-	 blow 	 ing 	 	and	so	on	the	other	side	of	human	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	that	to	be	 perfect 	 ly 	 	honest	with	you	,	i	was	 shatter 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	will	tell	you	that	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	through	that	 shatter 	 ing 	 	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	eight	-	year	-	old	 girl 	 s 	 	who	had	 the 	 ir 	 	 insid 	 es 	 	 eviscerate 	 d 	 	,	who	had	 gun 	 s 	 	and	 bayonet 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	 shove 	 d 	 	 in 	 side 	 	them	so	they	had	 hole 	 s 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 in 	 side 	 	them	where	 the 	 ir 	 	 pe 	 e 	 	and	poop	came	out	of	them	.
 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	story	of	80	-	year	-	old	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	 chain 	 s 	 	and	 circle 	 d 	 	,	and	where	 group 	 s 	 	of	men	would	come	and	rape	them	 period 	 ically 	 	,	all	in	the	name	of	economic	 exploit 	 ation 	 	to	steal	the	 mineral 	 s 	 	so	the	west	can	have	it	and	profit	from	them	.
my	mind	was	so	 shatter 	 ed 	 	.
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	for	me	is	that	that	 shatter 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 emb 	 old 	 ened 	 	me	in	a	way	i	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	 emb 	 old 	 ened 	 	.
that	 shatter 	 ing 	 	,	that	 open 	 ing 	 	of	my	girl	cell	,	that	kind	of	massive	 break 	 through 	 	of	my	heart	 allow 	 ed 	 	me	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	 courage 	 ous 	 	,	and	 brave 	 r 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	clever	than	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	past	in	my	life	.
i	want	to	say	that	i	think	the	 power 	 s 	 	that	be	know	that	empire	-	building	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	that	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	get	in	the	way	of	empire	-	building	.
 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	get	in	the	way	of	the	mass	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	of	the	earth	,	and	 excav 	 ating 	 	the	earth	,	and	 destroy 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	remember	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	my	father	,	who	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	violent	,	used	to	beat	me	.
and	he	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	say	,	while	he	was	 beat 	 ing 	 	me	,	``	do	n't	you	cry	.	do	n't	you	 da 	 re 	 	cry	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	my	 cry 	 ing 	 	 some 	 how 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	his	 brutal 	 ity 	 	to	him	.
and	even	in	the	moment	he	did	n't	want	to	be	 re 	 minded 	 	of	what	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
i	know	that	we	have	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	 annihil 	 ated 	 	the	girl	cell	.
and	i	want	to	say	we	've	 annihil 	 ated 	 	it	in	men	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	in	women	.
and	i	think	in	some	ways	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	much	 harsh 	 er 	 	to	men	in	the	 annihil 	 ation 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	girl	cell	.
i	see	how	 boy 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	up	,	and	i	see	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	planet	:	to	be	tough	,	to	be	 hard 	 ened 	 	,	to	distance	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 tender 	 ness 	 	,	to	not	cry	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	once	in	kosovo	,	when	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	a	man	break	down	,	that	 bullet 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hard 	 ened 	 	 tear 	 s 	 	,	that	when	we	do	n't	allow	men	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	girl	self	and	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 vulner 	 ability 	 	,	and	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 heart 	 s 	 	,	that	they	 be 	 come 	 	 hard 	 ened 	 	and	 hurt 	 ful 	 	and	violent	.
and	i	think	we	have	taught	men	to	be	secure	when	they	are	 in 	 secure 	 	,	to	pretend	they	know	 thing 	 s 	 	when	they	do	n't	know	 thing 	 s 	 	,	or	why	would	we	be	where	we	are	?
to	pretend	they	're	not	a	mess	when	they	are	a	mess	.
and	i	will	tell	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	funny	story	.
on	my	way	here	on	the	 air 	 plane 	 	,	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	the	aisle	of	the	plane	.
and	all	these	men	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	10	men	,	 we 	 re 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 seat 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	chick	 flick 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 al 	 one 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	secret	life	of	men	.	``
i	've	 travel 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	to	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	if	we	do	what	we	do	to	the	girl	 in 	 side 	 	us	then	 obvious 	 ly 	 	it	's	 horr 	 ific 	 	to	think	what	we	do	to	 girl 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
and	we	heard	from	sunitha	 yester 	 day 	 	,	and	kavita	about	what	we	do	to	 girl 	 s 	 	.
but	i	just	want	to	say	that	i	've	met	 girl 	 s 	 	with	knife	 wound 	 s 	 	and	 cigar 	 ette 	 	 burn 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	like	 ashtray 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	like	garbage	 can 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	and	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 father 	 s 	 	and	 uncle 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	 starv 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	death	in	america	in	 institution 	 s 	 	to	look	like	some	 ideal 	 ized 	 	version	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	we	cut	 girl 	 s 	 	and	we	control	them	and	we	keep	them	illiterate	,	or	we	make	them	feel	bad	about	 be 	 ing 	 	too	smart	.
we	silence	them	.	we	make	them	feel	 guilt 	 y 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	smart	.	we	get	them	to	 behav 	 e 	 	,	to	tone	it	down	,	not	to	be	too	 intens 	 e 	 	.
we	sell	them	,	we	kill	them	 a 	 s 	 	 embryo 	 s 	 	,	we	enslave	them	,	we	rape	them	.
we	are	so	 ac 	 custom 	 ed 	 	to	 rob 	 bing 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	of	the	subject	of	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 subject 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	that	we	have	now	 actual 	 ly 	 	 object 	 ified 	 	them	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 commodit 	 ies 	 	.
the	selling	of	 girl 	 s 	 	is	 ramp 	 ant 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	planet	.
and	in	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	they	are	worth	less	than	 goat 	 s 	 	and	 cow 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	talk	about	the	fact	that	if	one	in	eight	people	on	the	planet	are	 girl 	 s 	 	between	the	 age 	 s 	 	of	10	to	24	,	they	are	they	key	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	whole	world	,	to	the	future	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
and	if	 girl 	 s 	 	are	in	trouble	 be 	 cause 	 	they	face	 system 	 atic 	 	 dis 	 advantage 	 s 	 	that	keep	them	where	 socie 	 ty 	 	 want 	 s 	 	them	to	be	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	lack	of	access	to	 health 	 care 	 	,	education	,	 health 	 y 	 	 food 	 s 	 	,	labor	force	 particip 	 ation 	 	.
the	burden	of	all	the	 house 	 hold 	 	 task 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 s 	 	on	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 young 	 er 	 	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	,	which	 ensure 	 s 	 	that	they	will	never	 over 	 come 	 	these	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	.
the	state	of	 girl 	 s 	 	,	the	condition	of	 girl 	 s 	 	,	will	,	in	my	belief	--	and	that	's	the	girl	 in 	 side 	 	us	and	the	girl	in	the	world	--	determine	 whet 	 her 	 	the	species	 surviv 	 es 	 	.
and	what	i	want	to	suggest	is	that	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	 girl 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	just	 finish 	 ed 	 	a	new	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	i	am	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	creature	:	the	secret	life	of	 girl 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	``	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 girl 	 s 	 	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	is	true	 every 	 where 	 	is	that	the	verb	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 enforce 	 d 	 	on	girl	is	the	verb	``	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	``
 girl 	 s 	 	are	trained	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
i	want	to	change	the	verb	.
i	want	us	all	to	change	the	verb	.
i	want	the	verb	to	be	``	 educ 	 ate 	 	,	``	or	``	activate	,	``	or	``	engage	,	``	or	``	confront	,	``	or	``	defy	,	``	or	``	create	.	``

and	through	her	self	-	defense	,	she	 grab 	 bed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	adam	's	 apple 	 s 	 	,	she	 punch 	 ed 	 	them	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	and	she	got	 her 	 self 	 	free	and	out	of	the	car	.
in	kenya	,	in	august	,	i	went	to	visit	one	of	the	v	-	day	safe	 house 	 s 	 	for	 girl 	 s 	 	,	a	house	we	 open 	 ed 	 	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	with	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	woman	named	agnes	pareyio	.
agnes	was	a	woman	who	was	cut	when	she	was	a	little	girl	,	she	was	female	 genital 	 ly 	 	 mutilate 	 d 	 	.
and	she	made	a	decision	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	women	do	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	that	what	was	 d 	 one 	 	to	her	would	not	be	 enforce 	 d 	 	and	 d 	 one 	 	to	other	women	and	 girl 	 s 	 	.
so	,	for	 year 	 s 	 	agnes	 walk 	 ed 	 	through	the	rift	 val 	 ley 	 	.
she	taught	 girl 	 s 	 	what	a	 health 	 y 	 	vagina	 look 	 ed 	 	like	,	and	what	a	 mutilate 	 d 	 	vagina	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
and	in	that	time	she	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	.	and	when	we	met	her	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	what	we	could	do	for	her	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	if	you	got	me	a	jeep	i	could	get	around	a	lot	 fast 	 er 	 	.	``
so	,	we	got	her	a	jeep	.	and	then	she	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	4,500	 girl 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	what	else	do	you	need	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	now	,	i	need	a	house	.	``
so	,	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	agnes	built	the	first	v	-	day	safe	house	in	narok	,	kenya	,	in	the	masai	land	.
and	it	was	a	house	where	 girl 	 s 	 	could	run	away	,	they	could	 s 	 ave 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	clitoris	,	they	would	n't	be	cut	,	they	could	go	to	school	.
and	in	the	 year 	 s 	 	that	agnes	 ha 	 s 	 	had	the	house	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	there	.
she	 ha 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 de 	 put 	 y 	 	mayor	.
she	's	 change 	 d 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
the	whole	community	 ha 	 s 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	in	to	what	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
when	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	she	was	 do 	 ing 	 	a	ritual	where	she	 reconcile 	 s 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	,	who	have	run	away	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
and	there	was	a	young	girl	named	jaclyn	.
jaclyn	was	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	she	was	in	her	masai	family	and	there	's	a	drought	in	kenya	.
so	 cow 	 s 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	and	 cow 	 s 	 	are	the	most	 valu 	 ed 	 	 possess 	 ion 	 	.
and	jaclyn	 over 	 heard 	 	her	father	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	an	old	man	about	how	he	was	about	to	sell	her	for	the	 cow 	 s 	 	.
and	she	 k 	 new 	 	that	 me 	 ant 	 	she	would	be	cut	.
she	 k 	 new 	 	that	 me 	 ant 	 	she	would	n't	go	to	school	.
she	 k 	 new 	 	that	 me 	 ant 	 	she	would	n't	have	a	future	.
she	 k 	 new 	 	she	would	have	to	marry	that	old	man	,	and	she	was	14	.
so	,	one	afternoon	,	she	'd	heard	about	the	safe	house	,	jaclyn	left	her	father	's	house	and	she	 walk 	 ed 	 	for	two	 day 	 s 	 	,	two	 day 	 s 	 	through	masai	land	.
she	slept	with	the	 hyena 	 s 	 	.	she	hid	at	night	.
she	 imagin 	 ed 	 	her	father	 kill 	 ing 	 	her	on	one	hand	,	and	mama	agnes	 greet 	 ing 	 	her	,	with	the	hope	that	she	would	greet	her	when	she	got	to	the	house	.
and	when	she	got	to	the	house	she	was	 greet 	 ed 	 	.
agnes	took	her	in	,	and	agnes	 love 	 d 	 	her	,	and	agnes	 support 	 ed 	 	her	for	the	year	.
she	went	to	school	and	she	found	her	voice	,	and	she	found	her	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	and	she	found	her	heart	.
then	,	her	time	was	ready	when	she	had	to	go	back	to	talk	to	her	father	about	the	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	,	after	a	year	.
i	had	the	privilege	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	hut	when	she	was	 re 	 unit 	 ed 	 	with	her	father	and	 reconcile 	 d 	 	.
in	that	hut	,	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	,	and	her	father	and	his	four	wives	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	,	and	her	 sister 	 s 	 	who	had	just	 return 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	all	 fl 	 ed 	 	when	she	had	 fl 	 ed 	 	,	and	her	 prim 	 ary 	 	mother	,	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	in	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	for	her	with	the	 elder 	 s 	 	.
when	her	father	saw	her	and	saw	who	she	had	 be 	 come 	 	,	in	her	full	girl	self	,	he	threw	his	 arm 	 s 	 	around	her	and	broke	down	 cry 	 ing 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.	you	have	grown	 in 	 to 	 	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	woman	.
we	will	not	cut	you	.
and	i	give	you	my	word	,	here	and	now	,	that	we	will	not	cut	your	 sister 	 s 	 	either	.	``
and	what	she	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	was	,	``	you	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	sell	me	for	four	 cow 	 s 	 	,	and	a	 ca 	 lf 	 	and	some	 blank 	 et 	 s 	 	.
