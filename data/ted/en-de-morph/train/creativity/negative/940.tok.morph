so	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	you	about	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	of	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	and	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	long	,	 oil 	 y 	 	,	hot	summer	,	and	why	we	need	to	keep	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 get 	 ting 	 	 distract 	 ed 	 	.
but	before	i	talk	about	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	need	to	talk	about	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	of	oil	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	from	when	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	prudhoe	 ba 	 y 	 	in	alaska	in	2002	to	watch	the	 mineral 	 s 	 	management	service	 test 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	burn	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	in	ice	.
and	what	you	see	here	is	,	you	see	a	little	bit	of	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	,	you	see	some	ice	 cube 	 s 	 	,	and	you	see	two	sandwich	 bag 	 gie 	 s 	 	of	 na 	 palm 	 	.
the	 na 	 palm 	 	is	 burn 	 ing 	 	there	 quit 	 e 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	thing	is	,	is	that	oil	is	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 abstract 	 ion 	 	for	us	 a 	 s 	 	the	american	consumer	.
we	're	four	percent	of	the	world	's	population	;	we	use	25	percent	of	the	world	's	oil	production	.
and	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	what	oil	is	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	check	out	 it 	 s 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	that	 un 	 til 	 	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	burn	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	burn	 get 	 s 	 	going	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	off	.	it	's	a	big	woosh	.
i	 high 	 ly 	 	recommend	that	you	get	a	chance	to	see	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	burn	 some 	 day 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	will	never	need	to	hear	 an 	 other 	 	poli	sci	 lectur 	 e 	 	on	the	 geo 	 politic 	 s 	 	of	oil	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	'll	just	bake	your	 retina 	 s 	 	.
so	there	it	is	;	the	 retina 	 s 	 	are	 ba 	 king 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	 th 	 is 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	of	oil	.
oil	is	a	stew	of	 hydro 	 carbon 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	of	with	the	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 one 	 s 	 	,	which	are	one	carbon	,	four	hydrogen	--	that	's	 m 	 ethane 	 	--	it	just	 float 	 s 	 	off	.
then	there	's	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 inter 	 mediate 	 	 one 	 s 	 	with	middle	 amount 	 s 	 	of	carbon	.
you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	of	 be 	 n 	 zen 	 e 	 	 ring 	 s 	 	;	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 carcinogen 	 ic 	 	.
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	all	the	way	over	to	these	big	,	thick	,	 gal 	 um 	 phy 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	have	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 carbon 	 s 	 	,	and	they	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 hydrogen 	 s 	 	,	and	they	have	 van 	 ad 	 ium 	 	and	heavy	 metal 	 s 	 	and	sulfur	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 crazi 	 ness 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	off	the	 side 	 s 	 	of	them	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 asphalt 	 en 	 es 	 	;	they	're	an	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	in	asphalt	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	of	oil	in	water	.
it	is	 th 	 is 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	oil	so	 dis 	 astro 	 us 	 	.
oil	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sink	,	it	 float 	 s 	 	.
if	it	 s 	 an 	 k 	 	,	it	would	be	a	whole	different	story	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	an	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	.
and	the	other	thing	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 spread 	 s 	 	out	the	moment	it	 hit 	 s 	 	the	water	.
it	 spread 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	thin	,	so	you	have	a	hard	time	 corral 	 ling 	 	it	.
the	next	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	is	the	light	 end 	 s 	 	 evapo 	 rate 	 	,	and	some	of	the	toxic	 thing 	 s 	 	float	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	column	and	kill	fish	 egg 	 s 	 	and	 small 	 er 	 	fish	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	and	shrimp	.
and	then	the	 asphalt 	 en 	 es 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 cruci 	 al 	 	thing	--	the	 asphalt 	 en 	 es 	 	get	 whip 	 ped 	 	by	the	 wave 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 fro 	 thy 	 	 emul 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 may 	 onna 	 ise 	 	.
it	 triple 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	 oil 	 y 	 	,	 mess 	 y 	 	 go 	 o 	 	that	you	have	in	the	water	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	handle	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 visc 	 ous 	 	.
when	the	 pre 	 stig 	 e 	 	 s 	 an 	 k 	 	off	the	coast	of	spain	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	big	,	 float 	 ing 	 	 cushion 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 s 	 of 	 a 	 	 cushion 	 s 	 	of	 emul 	 s 	 ified 	 	oil	,	with	the	 consist 	 ency 	 	,	or	the	 visc 	 os 	 ity 	 	,	of	 chew 	 ing 	 	gum	.
it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	hard	to	clean	up	.
and	every	single	oil	is	different	when	it	 hit 	 s 	 	water	.
when	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	of	the	oil	and	water	 al 	 so 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	our	 politic 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	explosive	.
for	the	first	time	,	american	 consumer 	 s 	 	will	kind	of	see	the	oil	supply	chain	in	front	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	have	a	``	eureka	!	``	moment	,	when	we	 sudden 	 ly 	 	understand	oil	in	a	different	 con 	 text 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	talk	just	a	little	bit	about	the	origin	of	these	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 cruci 	 al 	 	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	why	 th 	 is 	 	summer	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	,	why	we	need	to	stay	focused	.
 no 	 body 	 	 get 	 s 	 	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	!	i	'm	going	to	go	buy	some	three	-	carbon	-	to	-	12	-	carbon	 molecule 	 s 	 	to	put	in	my	tank	and	drive	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	to	work	.	``
no	,	they	think	,	``	ugh	.	i	have	to	go	buy	gas	.
i	'm	so	 ang 	 ry 	 	about	it	.	the	oil	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 rip 	 ping 	 	me	off	.
they	set	the	 price 	 s 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	even	know	.
i	am	 help 	 less 	 	over	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	us	at	the	gas	pump	--	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	gas	 pump 	 s 	 	are	 specific 	 ally 	 	designed	to	diffuse	that	anger	.
you	might	notice	that	 man 	 y 	 	gas	 pump 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	are	designed	to	look	like	atms	.
i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	 engineer 	 s 	 	.	that	's	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	diffuse	our	anger	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 ly 	 	we	feel	good	about	atms	.
that	 show 	 s 	 	you	how	bad	it	is	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 help 	 lessness 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	 be 	 cause 	 	most	americans	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	that	oil	 price 	 s 	 	are	the	result	of	a	 conspi 	 racy 	 	,	not	of	the	 vic 	 issitudes 	 	of	the	world	oil	market	.
and	the	thing	is	,	too	,	is	that	we	 al 	 so 	 	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 help 	 less 	 	about	the	amount	that	we	 consum 	 e 	 	,	which	is	 some 	 what 	 	 reason 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	fact	,	we	have	designed	 th 	 is 	 	system	where	,	if	you	want	to	get	a	job	,	it	's	much	more	 import 	 ant 	 	to	have	a	car	that	 run 	 s 	 	,	to	have	a	job	and	keep	a	job	,	than	to	have	a	ged	.
and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 per 	 verse 	 	.
now	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 per 	 verse 	 	thing	about	the	way	we	buy	gas	,	which	is	that	we	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	bp	's	gas	station	in	 down 	 town 	 	los	angeles	.
it	is	green	.	it	is	a	 s 	 hr 	 ine 	 	to	 green 	 ish 	 ness 	 	.
``	now	,	``	you	think	,	``	why	would	 some 	 thing 	 	so	 lam 	 e 	 	work	on	people	so	smart	?	``
well	,	the	reason	is	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	,	when	we	're	 buy 	 ing 	 	gas	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	cognitive	dissonance	.
i	mean	,	we	're	 ang 	 ry 	 	at	the	one	hand	and	we	want	to	be	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
we	do	n't	want	to	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	oil	;	we	want	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	green	.
and	we	get	kind	of	in	on	our	own	con	.
i	mean	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	funny	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	funny	here	.
but	in	fact	,	that	's	why	the	slogan	``	beyond	petroleum	``	 work 	 ed 	 	.
but	it	's	an	inherent	part	of	our	energy	policy	,	which	is	we	do	n't	talk	about	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	amount	of	oil	that	we	use	.
we	talk	about	energy	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	.	we	talk	about	hydrogen	 car 	 s 	 	.
we	talk	about	 bio 	 fuel 	 s 	 	that	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	yet	.
and	so	,	cognitive	dissonance	is	part	and	parcel	of	the	way	that	we	deal	with	oil	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	the	 politic 	 s 	 	of	oil	are	 ver 	 y 	 	moral	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
the	oil	industry	is	like	a	huge	,	 gig 	 antic 	 	 oct 	 opus 	 	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	finance	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	,	but	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	it	in	 ver 	 y 	 	moral	 term 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	early	-	on	photograph	--	you	can	see	,	we	had	these	 gush 	 ers 	 	.
early	 journalist 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	these	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 filth 	 y 	 	industry	.	``
but	they	 al 	 so 	 	saw	in	it	that	people	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	rich	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	just	 get 	 ting 	 	rich	for	stuff	coming	out	of	the	ground	.
it	's	the	``	beverly	 hill 	 bill 	 ies 	 	,	``	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
but	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 moral 	 ly 	 	 problem 	 atic 	 	thing	,	long	before	it	 be 	 came 	 	funny	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	there	was	john	d.	rockefeller	.
and	the	thing	about	john	d.	is	that	he	went	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	chaotic	wild	-	east	of	oil	industry	,	and	he	 rational 	 ized 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 vert 	 ically 	 	 integrate 	 d 	 	company	,	a	 multi 	 national 	 	.
it	was	 terrify 	 ing 	 	;	you	think	walmart	is	a	 terrify 	 ing 	 	business	model	now	,	imagine	what	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	in	the	1860s	or	1870s	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	the	kind	of	root	of	how	we	see	oil	 a 	 s 	 	a	 conspi 	 racy 	 	.
but	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	is	that	ida	tarbell	,	the	journalist	,	went	in	and	did	a	big	 expo 	 s 	 Ã© 	 	of	rockefeller	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	the	whole	 anti 	 trust 	 	 law 	 s 	 	put	in	place	.
but	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	that	image	of	the	 conspi 	 racy 	 	still	 stick 	 s 	 	with	us	.
and	here	's	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	ida	tarbell	 s 	 aid 	 	--	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	thin	nose	like	a	thorn	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	no	lips	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 puff 	 s 	 	under	the	little	 color 	 less 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	with	 crease 	 s 	 	running	from	them	.	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	that	guy	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	still	with	us	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	pervasive	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	part	of	our	dna	.
and	then	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	,	you	might	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	why	it	is	that	,	every	time	we	have	high	oil	 price 	 s 	 	or	an	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	,	we	call	these	ceos	down	to	washington	,	and	we	sort	of	pepper	them	with	 question 	 s 	 	in	public	and	we	try	to	shame	them	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	since	1974	,	when	we	first	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	``	why	are	there	these	 ob 	 scene 	 	 profit 	 s 	 	?	``
and	we	've	sort	of	 personal 	 ized 	 	the	whole	oil	industry	 in 	 to 	 	these	ceos	.
and	we	take	it	 a 	 s 	 	,	you	know	--	we	look	at	it	on	a	moral	level	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	looking	at	it	on	a	legal	and	financial	level	.
and	so	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	n't	 li 	 able 	 	to	answer	 question 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	just	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	when	you	focus	on	 whet 	 her 	 	they	are	or	are	not	a	bunch	of	 greed 	 y 	 	 bastard 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	around	to	the	point	of	making	 law 	 s 	 	that	are	either	going	to	either	change	the	way	they	 oper 	 ate 	 	,	or	you	're	going	to	get	around	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	amount	of	oil	and	 reduc 	 ing 	 	our	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	oil	.
so	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	a	 distract 	 ion 	 	.
but	it	 make 	 s 	 	for	good	theater	,	and	it	's	 power 	 fully 	 	 cath 	 art 	 ic 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	saw	last	week	.
so	the	thing	about	water	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	is	that	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 politic 	 ally 	 	 galvan 	 izing 	 	.
i	mean	,	these	 picture 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	the	santa	barbara	 s 	 pill 	 	.
you	have	these	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 bird 	 s 	 	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	influence	people	.
when	the	santa	barbara	 s 	 pill 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	1969	,	it	 form 	 ed 	 	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	modern	form	.
it	 start 	 ed 	 	earth	day	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	put	in	place	the	national	 environment 	 al 	 	policy	act	,	the	clean	air	act	,	the	clean	water	act	.
 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 stem 	 med 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	period	.
i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	kind	of	look	at	these	 picture 	 s 	 	of	the	 bird 	 s 	 	and	understand	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	us	.
here	we	are	 normal 	 ly 	 	;	we	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	at	the	gas	pump	,	and	we	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	kind	of	 help 	 less 	 	.
we	look	at	these	 picture 	 s 	 	and	we	understand	,	for	the	first	time	,	our	role	in	 th 	 is 	 	supply	chain	.
we	connect	the	 dot 	 s 	 	in	the	supply	chain	.
and	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	--	 a 	 s 	 	 vot 	 ers 	 	,	we	have	kind	of	a	``	eureka	!	``	moment	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	these	 moment 	 s 	 	of	these	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	are	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	do	n't	get	 distract 	 ed 	 	by	the	theater	or	the	 moral 	 s 	 	of	it	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	need	to	go	in	and	work	on	the	 root 	 s 	 	of	the	problem	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	the	two	previous	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	was	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	on	some	of	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 active 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 pro 	 active 	 	about	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	what	we	did	was	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	made	 moratorium 	 s 	 	on	the	east	and	west	 coast 	 s 	 	on	 drill 	 ing 	 	.
we	 stop 	 ped 	 	 drill 	 ing 	 	in	anwr	,	but	we	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	amount	of	oil	that	we	 consum 	 ed 	 	.
in	fact	,	it	's	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 reduc 	 es 	 	the	amount	of	oil	that	we	 consum 	 e 	 	is	much	 high 	 er 	 	 price 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	our	own	production	 ha 	 s 	 	 fall 	 en 	 	off	 a 	 s 	 	our	 reservoir 	 s 	 	have	gotten	old	and	expensive	to	drill	out	.
we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	two	percent	of	the	world	's	oil	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	;	65	percent	of	them	are	in	the	persian	 gu 	 lf 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	,	since	1969	,	the	country	of	nigeria	,	or	the	part	of	nigeria	that	 pump 	 s 	 	oil	,	which	is	the	 del 	 ta 	 	--	which	is	two	 time 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	maryland	--	 ha 	 s 	 	had	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	a	year	.
i	mean	,	we	've	 essential 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 export 	 ing 	 	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	when	we	import	oil	from	 place 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	tight	 environment 	 al 	 	 regulat 	 ions 	 	.
that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	an	exxon	valdez	 s 	 pill 	 	every	year	since	1969	.
and	we	can	wrap	our	 head 	 s 	 	around	the	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	we	see	here	,	but	in	fact	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	live	in	a	war	zone	.
there	's	a	thousand	battle	-	related	 death 	 s 	 	a	year	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	twice	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	maryland	,	and	it	's	all	related	to	the	oil	.
and	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	i	mean	,	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	u.s.	,	they	might	be	 actual 	 ly 	 	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
they	have	 degree 	 s 	 	in	 politic 	 al 	 	science	,	 degree 	 s 	 	in	business	--	they	're	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.	they	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	sort	of	one	of	the	other	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	who	pay	a	price	for	us	.
the	other	thing	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	demand	,	is	that	we	kind	of	play	a	shell	game	with	the	 cost 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 place 	 s 	 	we	put	in	a	big	oil	project	in	chad	,	with	exxon	.
so	the	u.s.	taxpayer	paid	for	it	;	the	world	bank	,	exxon	paid	for	it	.
we	put	it	in	.	there	was	a	tremendous	 bandit 	 ry 	 	problem	.
i	was	there	in	2003	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	dark	,	dark	road	,	and	the	guy	in	the	green	 steppe 	 d 	 	out	,	and	i	was	just	like	,	``	 a 	 hhh 	 	!	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	.	``
and	then	the	guy	in	the	exxon	uniform	 steppe 	 d 	 	out	,	and	we	 real 	 ized 	 	it	was	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
they	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	private	sort	of	 arm 	 y 	 	around	them	at	the	oil	 field 	 s 	 	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	chad	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	much	more	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	,	and	we	are	not	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	that	price	at	the	pump	.
we	pay	for	it	in	our	 tax 	 es 	 	on	april	15th	.
we	do	the	same	thing	with	the	price	of	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	the	persian	 gu 	 lf 	 	and	 keep 	 ing 	 	the	 ship 	 ping 	 	 lane 	 s 	 	open	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	1988	--	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 bomb 	 ed 	 	two	iranian	oil	 platform 	 s 	 	that	year	.
that	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	an	 escal 	 ating 	 	u.s.	 involve 	 ment 	 	there	that	we	do	not	pay	for	at	the	pump	.
we	pay	for	it	on	april	15th	,	and	we	ca	n't	even	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	cost	of	 th 	 is 	 	 involve 	 ment 	 	.
the	other	place	that	is	sort	of	 support 	 ing 	 	our	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	oil	and	our	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	consumption	is	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	,	which	was	not	part	of	the	 moratorium 	 s 	 	.
now	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 mineral 	 s 	 	management	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	 well 	 s 	 	for	gas	and	oil	.
it	's	 be 	 come 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	 industrial 	 ized 	 	zone	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	the	same	 reson 	 ance 	 	for	us	that	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	national	 wild 	 life 	 	refuge	 ha 	 s 	 	,	but	it	should	,	i	mean	,	it	's	a	bird	 sanct 	 uary 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	every	time	you	buy	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	half	of	it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 refine 	 d 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	coast	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	about	50	percent	of	our	 re 	 fin 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	and	a	lot	of	our	marine	 terminal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	the	people	of	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	have	 essential 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 sub 	 sid 	 izing 	 	the	rest	of	us	through	a	less	-	clean	environment	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	american	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	 al 	 so 	 	pay	a	price	for	oil	.
now	on	the	one	hand	,	the	price	at	the	pump	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	high	when	you	consider	the	actual	cost	of	the	oil	,	but	on	the	other	hand	,	the	fact	that	people	have	no	other	transit	 option 	 s 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	they	pay	a	large	amount	of	 the 	 ir 	 	income	 in 	 to 	 	just	 get 	 ting 	 	back	and	forth	to	work	,	 general 	 ly 	 	in	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	crummy	car	.
if	you	look	at	people	who	make	$	50,000	a	year	,	they	have	two	 kid 	 s 	 	,	they	might	have	three	 job 	 s 	 	or	more	,	and	then	they	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	commute	.
they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	more	on	 the 	 ir 	 	car	and	fuel	than	they	are	on	 tax 	 es 	 	or	on	health	care	.
and	the	same	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	at	the	50th	 percent 	 ile 	 	,	around	80,000	.
 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	are	a	tremendous	drain	on	the	american	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	but	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	a	drain	on	individual	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	it	's	kind	of	 terrify 	 ing 	 	to	think	about	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	 price 	 s 	 	get	 high 	 er 	 	.
so	,	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	now	is	:	what	do	we	have	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	time	?
what	are	the	 law 	 s 	 	?	what	do	we	have	to	do	to	keep	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	focused	?
one	thing	is	--	we	need	to	stay	away	from	the	theater	.
we	need	to	stay	away	from	the	 moratorium 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	focus	 re 	 ally 	 	back	 aga 	 in 	 	on	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
the	 moratorium 	 s 	 	are	fine	,	but	we	do	need	to	focus	on	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	on	the	oil	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	do	,	is	we	need	to	try	to	not	kind	of	fool	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	that	you	can	have	a	green	world	,	before	you	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	amount	of	oil	that	we	use	.
we	need	to	focus	on	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	oil	.
what	you	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	top	 draw 	 ing 	 	is	a	schematic	of	how	petroleum	 get 	 s 	 	used	in	the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	in	on	the	side	--	the	 use 	 ful 	 	stuff	is	the	dark	gray	,	and	the	un	-	 use 	 ful 	 	stuff	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 reject 	 ed 	 	energy	--	the	waste	,	 go 	 es 	 	up	to	the	top	.
now	you	can	see	that	the	waste	far	 outweigh 	 s 	 	the	 actual 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	amount	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	do	is	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	fix	the	fuel	efficiency	of	our	 vehicle 	 s 	 	and	make	them	much	more	efficient	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	fix	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	general	.
we	need	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	 per 	 verse 	 	 incentive 	 s 	 	to	use	more	fuel	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	have	an	 insur 	 ance 	 	system	where	the	person	who	 drive 	 s 	 	20,000	 mile 	 s 	 	a	year	 pay 	 s 	 	the	same	 insur 	 ance 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	 drive 	 s 	 	3,000	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	people	to	drive	more	.
we	have	 poli 	 cies 	 	that	reward	sprawl	--	we	have	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 poli 	 cies 	 	.
we	need	to	have	more	 mobil 	 ity 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	make	the	gas	price	better	reflect	the	real	cost	of	oil	.
and	we	need	to	shift	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	from	the	oil	industry	,	which	is	at	 l 	 east 	 	10	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	,	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	middle	-	class	people	to	find	better	ways	to	commute	.
 whet 	 her 	 	that	's	 get 	 ting 	 	a	much	more	efficient	car	and	 al 	 so 	 	kind	of	building	 market 	 s 	 	for	new	 car 	 s 	 	and	new	 fuel 	 s 	 	down	the	road	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	need	to	be	.
we	need	to	kind	of	 rational 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	,	and	you	can	find	more	about	 th 	 is 	 	policy	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	strong	,	which	is	``	secure	 transport 	 ation 	 	 reduc 	 ing 	 	oil	 need 	 s 	 	 gradu 	 ally 	 	,	``	and	the	idea	is	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 help 	 less 	 	,	we	need	to	be	more	strong	.
they	're	up	at	newamerica	.	net	.
what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	about	these	is	that	we	try	to	move	from	 feel 	 ing 	 	 help 	 less 	 	at	the	pump	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	active	and	to	 re 	 ally 	 	sort	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	who	we	are	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	kind	of	that	special	moment	,	where	we	connect	the	 dot 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	at	the	pump	.
now	 suppose 	 d 	 ly 	 	,	oil	 tax 	 es 	 	are	the	third	rail	of	american	 politic 	 s 	 	--	the	no	-	fly	zone	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	i	agree	that	a	dollar	a	gallon	on	oil	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	too	much	,	but	i	think	that	if	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	with	three	 cent 	 s 	 	a	gallon	on	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	,	and	upped	it	to	six	 cent 	 s 	 	next	year	,	nine	 cent 	 s 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	year	,	all	the	way	up	to	30	 cent 	 s 	 	by	2020	,	that	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	our	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	consumption	,	and	at	the	same	time	we	would	give	people	time	to	 prep 	 are 	 	,	time	to	respond	,	and	we	would	be	raising	money	and	raising	 conscious 	 ness 	 	at	the	same	time	.
let	me	give	you	a	little	sense	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	would	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	gas	receipt	,	 hypothetical 	 ly 	 	,	for	a	year	from	now	.
the	first	thing	that	you	have	on	the	tax	is	--	you	have	a	tax	for	a	 strong 	 er 	 	america	--	33	 cent 	 s 	 	.
so	you	're	not	 help 	 less 	 	at	the	pump	.
and	the	second	thing	that	you	have	is	a	kind	of	 war 	 ning 	 	sign	,	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	what	you	would	find	on	a	 cigar 	 ette 	 	pack	.
and	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	is	,	``	the	national	academy	of	 science 	 s 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	that	every	gallon	of	gas	you	burn	in	your	car	 create 	 s 	 	29	 cent 	 s 	 	in	health	care	 cost 	 s 	 	.	``
that	's	a	lot	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	--	you	can	see	that	you	're	 pay 	 ing 	 	 consider 	 ably 	 	less	than	the	health	care	 cost 	 s 	 	on	the	tax	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	hope	is	that	you	start	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	whole	 great 	 er 	 	system	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	you	have	a	number	that	you	can	call	to	get	more	information	on	 com 	 mut 	 ing 	 	,	or	a	low	-	interest	loan	on	a	different	kind	of	car	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	you	're	going	to	need	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	your	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	 depend 	 ence 	 	.
with	 th 	 is 	 	whole	sort	of	 suit 	 e 	 	of	 poli 	 cies 	 	,	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	our	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	consumption	--	or	our	oil	consumption	--	by	20	percent	by	2020	.
so	,	three	million	 barrel 	 s 	 	a	day	.
but	in	order	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	do	,	is	we	need	to	remember	we	are	people	of	the	 hydro 	 carbon 	 	.
we	need	to	keep	or	 mind 	 s 	 	on	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	not	get	 distract 	 ed 	 	by	the	theater	,	not	get	 distract 	 ed 	 	by	the	cognitive	dissonance	of	the	green	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	are	out	there	.
we	need	to	kind	of	get	down	and	do	the	 grit 	 ty 	 	work	of	 reduc 	 ing 	 	our	 depend 	 ence 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fuel	and	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
