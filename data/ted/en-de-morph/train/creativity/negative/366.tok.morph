i	grew	up	in	europe	,	and	world	war	ii	caught	me	when	i	was	between	seven	and	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	how	few	of	the	grown	-	 up 	 s 	 	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 with 	 stand 	 	the	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	that	the	war	 visit 	 ed 	 	on	them	--	how	few	of	them	could	even	resemble	a	normal	,	 content 	 ed 	 	,	satisfied	,	happy	life	once	 the 	 ir 	 	job	,	 the 	 ir 	 	home	,	 the 	 ir 	 	security	was	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	the	war	.
so	i	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	a	life	that	was	worth	living	.
and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	teenager	,	to	read	 philosoph 	 y 	 	and	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	art	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	ways	that	i	could	see	 a 	 s 	 	a	possible	answer	to	that	question	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 en 	 counter 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	by	chance	.
i	was	at	a	ski	resort	in	switzerland	 with 	 out 	 	any	money	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	enjoy	 my 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	snow	had	 melt 	 ed 	 	and	i	did	n't	have	money	to	go	to	a	movie	.	but	i	found	that	on	the	--	i	read	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	that	there	was	to	be	a	 present 	 ation 	 	by	 some 	 one 	 	in	a	place	that	i	'd	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	center	of	zurich	,	and	it	was	about	 fly 	 ing 	 	 saucer 	 s 	 	[	that	]	he	was	going	to	talk	.
and	i	thought	,	well	,	since	i	ca	n't	go	to	the	 movie 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	will	go	for	free	to	listen	to	 fly 	 ing 	 	 saucer 	 s 	 	.
and	the	man	who	 talk 	 ed 	 	at	that	 even 	 ing 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	little	green	men	,	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	the	 psych 	 e 	 	of	the	europeans	had	 be 	 en 	 	 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 	by	the	war	,	and	now	they	're	 project 	 ing 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 saucer 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	.
he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	the	 man 	 d 	 ala 	 s 	 	of	ancient	hindu	 relig 	 ion 	 	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 project 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	 a 	 s 	 	an	attempt	to	regain	some	sense	of	order	after	the	 cha 	 os 	 	of	war	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	his	 book 	 s 	 	after	that	 lectur 	 e 	 	.
and	that	was	carl	jung	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	name	or	work	i	had	no	idea	about	.
then	i	came	to	 th 	 is 	 	country	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	 root 	 s 	 	of	happiness	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	typical	result	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 present 	 ed 	 	,	and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	on	it	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 show 	 s 	 	that	about	30	percent	of	the	people	 survey 	 ed 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	since	1956	say	that	 the 	 ir 	 	life	is	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	.
and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	at	all	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	personal	income	,	on	a	scale	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	held	constant	to	 accommo 	 date 	 	for	 infla 	 tion 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	more	than	 double 	 d 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 triple 	 d 	 	,	in	that	period	.
but	you	find	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	same	 result 	 s 	 	,	 name 	 ly 	 	,	that	after	a	certain	 bas 	 ic 	 	point	--	which	 correspond 	 s 	 	more	or	less	to	just	a	few	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	above	the	 minim 	 um 	 	poverty	level	--	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	material	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	do	n't	seem	to	affect	how	happy	people	are	.
in	fact	,	you	can	find	that	the	lack	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	material	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	 un 	 happiness 	 	,	but	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	material	 resource 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	 in 	 crease 	 	happiness	.
so	my	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	focused	more	on	--	after	 find 	 ing 	 	out	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 correspond 	 ed 	 	to	my	own	experience	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	:	where	--	in	 every 	 day 	 	life	,	in	our	normal	experience	--	do	we	feel	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	?
 t 	 hose 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	about	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	look	at	creative	people	--	first	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	so	forth	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	what	made	them	feel	that	it	was	worth	 essential 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	which	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	did	n't	expect	either	fame	or	fortune	,	but	which	made	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	worth	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 compose 	 rs 	 	of	american	music	back	in	the	'70s	.
and	the	interview	was	40	 page 	 s 	 	long	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	little	excerpt	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 summ 	 ary 	 	of	what	he	was	 say 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	interview	.
and	it	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	how	he	 feel 	 s 	 	when	 com 	 posing 	 	is	going	well	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	by	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ec 	 static 	 	state	.
now	,	``	 ecstas 	 y 	 	``	in	greek	 me 	 ant 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	stand	to	the	side	of	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	then	it	 be 	 came 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	an	 analog 	 y 	 	for	a	mental	state	where	you	feel	that	you	are	not	 do 	 ing 	 	your	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 every 	 day 	 	 routine 	 s 	 	.
so	 ecstas 	 y 	 	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 step 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 alter 	 native 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	how	,	when	we	think	about	the	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	we	look	up	to	 a 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pinnacle 	 s 	 	of	human	 achiev 	 ement 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 chin 	 a 	 	,	greece	,	the	hindu	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	or	the	mayas	,	or	egyptians	--	what	we	know	about	them	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 ecstas 	 ies 	 	,	not	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
we	know	the	 temple 	 s 	 	they	built	,	where	people	could	come	to	experience	a	different	 re 	 ality 	 	.
we	know	about	the	 circus 	 es 	 	,	the	 arena 	 s 	 	,	the	 theater 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	 remain 	 s 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	they	are	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	people	went	to	experience	life	in	a	more	 concent 	 rated 	 	,	more	 order 	 ed 	 	form	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	man	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	go	to	a	place	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	 al 	 so 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	 th 	 is 	 	arena	,	which	is	built	like	a	greek	 amphi 	 theatre 	 	,	is	a	place	for	 ecstas 	 y 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
we	are	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	a	 re 	 ality 	 	that	is	different	from	that	of	the	 every 	 day 	 	life	that	we	're	used	to	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	man	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	go	there	.
he	 need 	 s 	 	just	a	piece	of	paper	where	he	can	put	down	little	 mark 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	that	,	he	can	imagine	 sound 	 s 	 	that	had	not	 exist 	 ed 	 	before	in	that	 part 	 icular 	 	combination	.
so	once	he	 get 	 s 	 	to	that	point	of	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	create	,	like	jennifer	did	in	her	improvisation	,	a	new	 re 	 ality 	 	--	that	is	,	a	moment	of	 ecstas 	 y 	 	--	he	 enter 	 s 	 	that	different	 re 	 ality 	 	.
now	he	 say 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 intens 	 e 	 	an	experience	that	it	 feel 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	he	did	n't	exist	.
and	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	kind	of	a	romantic	 exagge 	 ration 	 	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	our	nervous	system	is	 in 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 process 	 ing 	 	more	than	about	110	bits	of	information	per	second	.
and	in	order	to	hear	me	and	understand	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	need	to	process	about	60	bits	per	second	.
that	's	why	you	ca	n't	hear	more	than	two	people	.
you	ca	n't	understand	more	than	two	people	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	.
well	,	when	you	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	process	of	creating	 some 	 thing 	 	new	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	man	is	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	attention	left	over	to	monitor	how	his	body	 feel 	 s 	 	,	or	his	 problem 	 s 	 	at	home	.
he	ca	n't	feel	even	that	he	's	 hung 	 ry 	 	or	 tire 	 d 	 	.
his	body	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	his	 ident 	 ity 	 	 disappear 	 s 	 	from	his	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	attention	,	like	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	do	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	do	well	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 requir 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	 concent 	 ration 	 	,	and	at	the	same	time	to	feel	that	he	 exist 	 s 	 	.
so	 exist 	 ence 	 	is	 tempor 	 arily 	 	 suspend 	 ed 	 	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	that	his	hand	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	moving	by	 it 	 self 	 	.
now	,	i	could	look	at	my	hand	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	i	would	n't	feel	any	awe	or	wonder	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	ca	n't	compose	.
so	what	it	's	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	here	is	that	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 autom 	 atic 	 	,	 spontane 	 ous 	 	process	that	he	's	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	happen	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	is	 ver 	 y 	 	well	trained	and	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	kind	of	a	truism	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	that	you	ca	n't	be	creating	 any 	 thing 	 	with	less	than	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	technical	-	knowledge	 immers 	 ion 	 	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	field	.
 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 mathematic 	 s 	 	or	music	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	that	long	to	be	able	to	begin	to	change	 some 	 thing 	 	in	a	way	that	it	's	better	than	what	was	there	before	.
now	,	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	the	music	just	 flow 	 s 	 	out	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	these	people	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 interview 	 ing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	interview	which	is	over	30	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	 de 	 scribed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 spontane 	 ous 	 	flow	that	i	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	experience	the	``	flow	experience	.	``
and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	different	 realm 	 s 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	a	poet	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	form	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	by	a	student	of	mine	who	 interview 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 poet 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	the	same	 effort 	 less 	 	,	 spontane 	 ous 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	you	get	when	you	enter	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ec 	 static 	 	state	.
 th 	 is 	 	poet	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	a	door	that	 float 	 s 	 	in	the	sky	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	to	what	albert	einstein	 g 	 ave 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	he	 imagin 	 ed 	 	the	 force 	 s 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	when	he	was	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	how	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.
but	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	other	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	student	of	mine	,	susan	jackson	from	australia	,	who	did	work	with	some	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 athlete 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
and	you	see	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	an	olympic	 s 	 ka 	 ter 	 	,	the	same	essential	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	 phenomen 	 ology 	 	of	the	inner	state	of	the	person	.
you	do	n't	think	;	it	 go 	 es 	 	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	,	if	you	merge	 your 	 self 	 	with	the	music	,	and	so	forth	.
it	 happen 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	most	 re 	 cent 	 	book	i	wrote	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	good	business	,	``	where	i	 interview 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	ceos	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 nominate 	 d 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 peer 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	both	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 ethic 	 al 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 social 	 ly 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	.
you	see	that	these	people	define	success	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 help 	 s 	 	 other 	 s 	 	and	at	the	same	time	 make 	 s 	 	you	feel	happy	 a 	 s 	 	you	are	 work 	 ing 	 	at	it	.
and	like	all	of	these	 success 	 ful 	 	and	 respons 	 ible 	 	ceos	say	,	you	ca	n't	have	just	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	be	 success 	 ful 	 	if	you	want	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	 success 	 ful 	 	job	.
anita	roddick	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	these	ceos	we	 interview 	 ed 	 	.
she	is	the	founder	of	body	shop	,	the	natural	 cosmetic 	 s 	 	king	.
it	's	kind	of	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	 do 	 ing 	 	the	best	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	flow	while	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	little	quote	from	masaru	ibuka	,	who	was	at	that	time	 start 	 ing 	 	out	sony	 with 	 out 	 	any	money	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	product	--	they	did	n't	have	a	product	,	they	did	n't	have	 any 	 thing 	 	,	but	they	had	an	idea	.
and	the	idea	he	had	was	to	establish	a	place	of	work	where	 engineer 	 s 	 	can	feel	the	joy	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	be	aware	of	 the 	 ir 	 	mission	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	work	to	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	's	content	.
i	could	n't	improve	on	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	flow	 enter 	 s 	 	the	 work 	 place 	 	.
now	,	when	we	do	 stud 	 ies 	 	--	we	have	,	with	other	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	 d 	 one 	 	over	8,000	 interview 	 s 	 	of	people	--	from	dominican	 monk 	 s 	 	,	to	blind	 n 	 un 	 s 	 	,	to	himalayan	 climb 	 ers 	 	,	to	navajo	 shepherd 	 s 	 	--	who	enjoy	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
and	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	culture	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	education	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	there	are	these	seven	 condition 	 s 	 	that	seem	to	be	there	when	a	person	is	in	flow	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	focus	that	,	once	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	,	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	sense	of	 ecstas 	 y 	 	,	a	sense	of	 clar 	 ity 	 	:	you	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	want	to	do	from	one	moment	to	the	other	;	you	get	 im 	 mediate 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	.
you	know	that	what	you	need	to	do	is	possible	to	do	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	difficult	,	and	sense	of	time	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	you	forget	 your 	 self 	 	,	you	feel	part	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 large 	 r 	 	.
and	once	the	 condition 	 s 	 	are	present	,	what	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	worth	 do 	 ing 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	own	sake	.
in	our	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	we	represent	the	 every 	 day 	 	life	of	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	simple	scheme	.
and	we	can	measure	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	give	people	 electron 	 ic 	 	 page 	 rs 	 	that	go	off	10	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	,	and	 when 	 ever 	 	they	go	off	you	say	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	how	you	feel	,	where	you	are	,	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
and	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	measure	is	the	amount	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	people	experience	at	that	moment	and	the	amount	of	skill	that	they	feel	they	have	at	that	moment	.
so	for	each	person	we	can	establish	an	average	,	which	is	the	center	of	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
that	would	be	your	mean	level	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	skill	,	which	will	be	different	from	that	of	 any 	 body 	 	else	.
but	you	have	a	kind	of	a	set	point	there	,	which	would	be	in	the	middle	.
if	we	know	what	that	set	point	is	,	we	can	predict	 fair 	 ly 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	when	you	will	be	in	flow	,	and	it	will	be	when	your	 challeng 	 es 	 	are	 high 	 er 	 	than	average	and	 skill 	 s 	 	are	 high 	 er 	 	than	average	.
and	you	may	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	from	other	people	,	but	for	 every 	 one 	 	that	flow	channel	,	that	area	there	,	will	be	when	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	like	to	do	--	play	the	piano	,	be	with	your	best	friend	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	work	,	if	work	is	what	 provide 	 s 	 	flow	for	you	.
and	then	the	other	 area 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	less	and	less	positive	.
arousal	is	still	good	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	over	-	 challeng 	 ed 	 	there	.
your	 skill 	 s 	 	are	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	they	should	be	,	but	you	can	move	 in 	 to 	 	flow	 fair 	 ly 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	by	just	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	little	more	skill	.
so	,	arousal	is	the	area	where	most	people	learn	from	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	they	're	 push 	 ed 	 	beyond	 the 	 ir 	 	comfort	zone	and	to	enter	that	--	going	back	to	flow	--	then	they	develop	 high 	 er 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
control	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	good	place	to	be	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	you	feel	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	but	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	any	more	.
and	if	you	want	to	enter	flow	from	control	,	you	have	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	two	are	ideal	and	 comple 	 ment 	 ary 	 	 area 	 s 	 	from	which	flow	is	easy	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	.
the	other	 combination 	 s 	 	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	skill	 be 	 come 	 	 progress 	 ively 	 	less	optimal	.
 relax 	 ation 	 	is	fine	--	you	still	feel	ok	.
 bore 	 dom 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	aversive	and	 a 	 pathy 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	negative	:	you	do	n't	feel	that	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	,	you	do	n't	use	your	 skill 	 s 	 	,	there	's	no	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	people	's	experience	is	in	 a 	 pathy 	 	.
the	largest	single	contributor	to	that	experience	is	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	;	the	next	one	is	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	 bath 	 room 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	about	seven	to	eight	percent	of	the	time	is	in	flow	,	but	that	's	when	you	 choos 	 e 	 	a	program	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	watch	and	you	get	 feed 	 back 	 	from	it	.
so	the	question	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	address	--	and	i	'm	way	over	time	--	is	how	to	put	more	and	more	of	 every 	 day 	 	life	in	that	flow	channel	.
and	that	is	the	kind	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	.
and	some	of	you	 obvious 	 ly 	 	know	how	to	do	that	 spontane 	 ously 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	.
and	that	's	what	our	 man 	 date 	 	is	,	in	a	way	,	to	do	.
thank	you	.
