have	you	ever	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	is	 in 	 side 	 	your	 dent 	 al 	 	 pla 	 que 	 	?
 prob 	 ably 	 	not	,	but	people	like	me	do	.
i	'm	an	 archeo 	 logical 	 	 genetic 	 ist 	 	at	the	center	for	 evolution 	 ary 	 	medicine	at	the	university	of	zurich	,	and	i	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 origin 	 s 	 	and	evolution	of	human	health	and	disease	by	 conduct 	 ing 	 	genetic	research	on	the	skeletal	and	 mum 	 m 	 ified 	 	 remain 	 s 	 	of	ancient	 human 	 s 	 	.
and	through	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	i	hope	to	better	understand	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 vulner 	 abilities 	 	of	our	bodies	,	so	that	we	can	improve	and	better	manage	our	health	in	the	future	.
there	are	different	ways	to	approach	 evolution 	 ary 	 	medicine	,	and	one	way	is	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	human	dna	from	ancient	 bone 	 s 	 	.
and	from	these	 ex 	 tract 	 s 	 	,	we	can	 re 	 construct 	 	the	human	genome	at	different	 point 	 s 	 	in	time	and	look	for	 change 	 s 	 	that	might	be	related	to	 adapt 	 ations 	 	,	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	and	 inherit 	 ed 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	half	of	the	story	.
the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	health	 challeng 	 es 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	not	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	simple	 mutation 	 s 	 	in	our	genome	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	result	from	a	complex	and	dynamic	 inter 	 play 	 	between	genetic	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	diet	,	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	and	 parasit 	 es 	 	and	our	 immun 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
all	of	these	 disease 	 s 	 	have	a	strong	 evolution 	 ary 	 	component	that	 direct 	 ly 	 	 relat 	 es 	 	to	the	fact	that	we	live	 to 	 day 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	environment	than	the	 one 	 s 	 	in	which	our	bodies	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
and	in	order	to	understand	these	 disease 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	move	past	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	the	human	genome	 al 	 one 	 	and	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	more	 hol 	 istic 	 	approach	to	human	health	in	the	past	.
but	there	are	a	lot	of	 challeng 	 es 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	first	of	all	,	what	do	we	even	 stud 	 y 	 	?
 skeleton 	 s 	 	are	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	;	they	're	found	all	over	the	place	.
but	of	course	,	all	of	the	soft	tissue	 ha 	 s 	 	 de 	 compose 	 d 	 	,	and	the	skeleton	 it 	 self 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	health	information	.
mummies	are	a	great	source	of	information	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 geo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	and	 limit 	 ed 	 	in	time	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
coprolites	are	 fossil 	 ized 	 	human	 fec 	 es 	 	,	and	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	learn	a	lot	about	ancient	diet	and	intestinal	disease	,	but	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	.
so	to	address	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	i	put	together	a	team	of	 inter 	 national 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	in	switzerland	,	denmark	and	the	u.k	.
to	 stud 	 y 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 poor 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	,	little	known	material	that	's	found	on	people	 every 	 where 	 	.
it	's	a	type	of	 fossil 	 ized 	 	 dent 	 al 	 	 pla 	 que 	 	that	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 official 	 ly 	 	 dent 	 al 	 	 calcul 	 us 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	know	it	by	the	term	 tart 	 ar 	 	.
it	's	what	the	 dent 	 ist 	 	 clean 	 s 	 	off	your	 tee 	 th 	 	every	time	that	you	go	in	for	a	visit	.
and	in	a	typical	 dent 	 ist 	 ry 	 	visit	,	you	may	have	about	15	to	30	 milli 	 gram 	 s 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	.
but	in	ancient	 time 	 s 	 	before	tooth	 brush 	 ing 	 	,	up	to	600	 milli 	 gram 	 s 	 	might	have	built	up	on	the	 tee 	 th 	 	over	a	 life 	 time 	 	.
and	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	about	 dent 	 al 	 	 calcul 	 us 	 	is	that	it	 fossil 	 ize 	 s 	 	just	like	the	rest	of	the	skeleton	,	it	's	abundant	in	 quant 	 ity 	 	before	the	present	day	and	it	's	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
we	find	it	in	every	population	around	the	world	at	all	time	 period 	 s 	 	going	back	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	we	even	find	it	in	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	so	previous	 stud 	 ies 	 	had	 on 	 ly 	 	focused	on	 micro 	 s 	 copy 	 	.
they	'd	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 dent 	 al 	 	 calcul 	 us 	 	under	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	and	what	they	had	found	was	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 poll 	 en 	 	and	plant	 starch 	 es 	 	,	and	they	'd	found	muscle	 cell 	 s 	 	from	animal	 meat 	 s 	 	and	bacteria	.
and	so	what	my	team	of	 research 	 ers 	 	,	what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	,	is	say	,	can	we	 app 	 ly 	 	genetic	and	 proteo 	 mic 	 	technology	to	go	after	dna	and	 protein 	 s 	 	,	and	from	 th 	 is 	 	can	we	get	better	 tax 	 o 	 nomic 	 	 re 	 solution 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	what	's	going	on	?
and	what	we	found	is	that	we	can	find	 man 	 y 	 	 commen 	 s 	 al 	 	and	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	bacteria	that	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	the	 na 	 s 	 al 	 	 pass 	 age 	 s 	 	and	mouth	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	found	 immun 	 e 	 	 protein 	 s 	 	related	to	 infect 	 ion 	 	and	 inflamm 	 ation 	 	and	 protein 	 s 	 	and	dna	related	to	diet	.
but	what	was	surprising	to	us	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	is	we	 al 	 so 	 	found	bacteria	that	 normal 	 ly 	 	inhabit	upper	 respirator 	 y 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	virtual	access	to	the	 lung 	 s 	 	,	which	is	where	 man 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	 re 	 side 	 	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	found	bacteria	that	 normal 	 ly 	 	inhabit	the	gut	.
and	so	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	now	 virtual 	 ly 	 	gain	access	to	 th 	 is 	 	even	more	 di 	 stant 	 	organ	system	that	,	from	the	skeleton	 al 	 one 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	long	 de 	 compose 	 d 	 	.
and	so	by	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	ancient	dna	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	and	protein	mass	 spectro 	 metry 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	ancient	 dent 	 al 	 	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	we	can	generate	immense	 quant 	 ities 	 	of	data	that	then	we	can	use	to	begin	to	 re 	 construct 	 	a	 detail 	 ed 	 	picture	of	the	dynamic	 inter 	 play 	 	between	diet	,	 infect 	 ion 	 	and	 immun 	 ity 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	what	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	an	idea	,	is	now	 be 	 ing 	 	 implement 	 ed 	 	to	churn	out	 million 	 s 	 	of	 sequence 	 s 	 	that	we	can	use	to	investigate	the	long	-	term	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	human	health	and	disease	,	right	down	to	the	genetic	code	of	individual	 pathogen 	 s 	 	.
and	from	 th 	 is 	 	information	we	can	learn	about	how	 pathogen 	 s 	 	evolve	and	 al 	 so 	 	why	they	 continu 	 e 	 	to	make	us	sick	.
and	i	hope	i	have	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	you	of	the	value	of	 dent 	 al 	 	 calcul 	 us 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	final	 part 	 ing 	 	thought	,	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	future	 archeo 	 logists 	 	,	i	would	like	to	ask	you	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	think	twice	before	you	go	home	and	brush	your	 tee 	 th 	 	.
thank	you	.
