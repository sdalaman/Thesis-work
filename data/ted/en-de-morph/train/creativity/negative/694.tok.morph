 a 	 s 	 	technology	 progress 	 es 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 advance 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	 assum 	 e 	 	that	these	 advance 	 s 	 	make	us	more	intelligent	,	make	us	 smart 	 er 	 	and	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	world	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	 argu 	 e 	 	is	that	that	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	the	case	,	 a 	 s 	 	progress	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	word	for	change	,	and	with	change	you	gain	 some 	 thing 	 	,	but	you	 al 	 so 	 	lose	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 illustr 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	what	i	'd	like	to	do	is	to	show	you	how	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 deal 	 t 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	common	,	an	 every 	 day 	 	question	.
and	that	question	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	time	is	it	?	what	time	is	it	?
if	you	glance	at	your	iphone	,	it	's	so	simple	to	tell	the	time	.
but	,	i	'd	like	to	ask	you	,	how	would	you	tell	the	time	if	you	did	n't	have	an	iphone	?
how	would	you	tell	the	time	,	say	,	600	 year 	 s 	 	ago	?
how	would	you	do	it	?
well	,	the	way	you	would	do	it	is	by	using	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	an	astrolabe	.
so	,	an	astrolabe	is	 relat 	 ively 	 	 un 	 known 	 	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	world	.
but	,	at	the	time	,	in	the	13th	century	,	it	was	the	gadget	of	the	day	.
it	was	the	world	's	first	popular	computer	.
and	it	was	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	,	in	fact	,	is	a	model	of	the	sky	.
so	,	the	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	astrolabe	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	type	,	the	 re 	 te 	 	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	the	 position 	 s 	 	of	the	 star 	 s 	 	.
the	plate	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	a	coordinate	system	.
and	the	 mat 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 scale 	 s 	 	and	 put 	 s 	 	it	all	together	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	an	educated	child	,	you	would	know	how	to	not	 on 	 ly 	 	use	the	astrolabe	,	you	would	 al 	 so 	 	know	how	to	make	an	astrolabe	.
and	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	first	 treat 	 ise 	 	on	the	astrolabe	,	the	first	technical	manual	in	the	english	language	,	was	written	by	geoffrey	chaucer	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	that	geoffrey	chaucer	,	in	1391	,	to	his	little	lewis	,	his	11	-	year	-	old	son	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	little	lewis	would	know	the	big	idea	.
and	the	central	idea	that	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	computer	work	is	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	 stereo 	 graphic 	 	 project 	 ion 	 	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	 con 	 cept 	 	is	,	how	do	you	represent	the	three	-	dimensional	image	of	the	night	sky	that	 surround 	 s 	 	us	onto	a	flat	,	 port 	 able 	 	,	two	-	dimensional	surface	.
the	idea	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	simple	.
imagine	that	that	earth	is	at	the	center	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	 surround 	 ing 	 	it	is	the	sky	 project 	 ed 	 	onto	a	sphere	.
each	point	on	the	surface	of	the	sphere	is	 ma 	 pped 	 	through	the	bottom	pole	,	onto	a	flat	surface	,	where	it	is	then	 record 	 ed 	 	.
so	the	north	star	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	the	center	of	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
the	 e 	 clip 	 tic 	 	,	which	is	the	path	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	moon	,	and	 planet 	 s 	 	correspond	to	an	 off 	 set 	 	circle	.
the	bright	 star 	 s 	 	correspond	to	little	 da 	 gger 	 s 	 	on	the	 re 	 te 	 	.
and	the	altitude	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	the	plate	system	.
now	,	the	real	 gen 	 ius 	 	of	the	astrolabe	is	not	just	the	 project 	 ion 	 	.
the	real	 gen 	 ius 	 	is	that	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	together	two	coordinate	 system 	 s 	 	so	they	fit	 perfect 	 ly 	 	.
there	is	the	position	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	moon	and	 planet 	 s 	 	on	the	movable	 re 	 te 	 	.
and	then	there	is	 the 	 ir 	 	location	on	the	sky	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	from	a	certain	latitude	on	the	back	plate	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
so	how	would	you	use	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	?
well	,	let	me	first	back	up	for	a	moment	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	astrolabe	.	 pre 	 tty 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
and	so	,	 th 	 is 	 	astrolabe	is	on	loan	from	us	from	the	oxford	school	of	--	museum	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	you	can	see	the	different	 component 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 mat 	 er 	 	,	the	 scale 	 s 	 	on	the	back	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 re 	 te 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	do	you	see	that	?
that	's	the	movable	part	of	the	sky	.
and	in	the	back	you	can	see	a	spider	web	pattern	.
and	that	spider	web	pattern	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	the	local	 coordinate 	 s 	 	in	the	sky	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	rule	 de 	 vice 	 	.	and	on	the	back	are	some	other	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	 measur 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	and	 scale 	 s 	 	,	to	be	able	to	make	some	 calcul 	 ations 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
you	know	,	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	one	of	these	.
for	my	thesis	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	built	one	of	these	out	of	paper	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	replica	from	a	15th	-	century	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	it	's	worth	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	three	macbook	 pro 	 s 	 	.
but	a	real	one	would	cost	about	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	my	house	,	and	the	house	next	to	it	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	every	house	on	the	block	,	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	street	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	school	 throw 	 n 	 	in	,	and	some	--	you	know	,	a	church	.
they	are	just	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	expensive	.
but	let	me	show	you	how	to	work	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
so	let	's	go	to	step	one	.
first	thing	that	you	do	is	you	select	a	star	in	the	night	sky	,	if	you	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	time	at	night	.
so	,	 to 	 night 	 	,	if	it	's	clear	you	'll	be	able	to	see	the	summer	triangle	.
and	there	is	a	bright	star	 call 	 ed 	 	deneb	.	so	let	's	select	deneb	.
second	,	is	you	measure	the	altitude	of	deneb	.
so	,	step	two	,	i	hold	the	 de 	 vice 	 	up	,	and	then	i	sight	 it 	 s 	 	altitude	there	so	i	can	see	it	 clear 	 ly 	 	now	.
and	then	i	measure	 it 	 s 	 	altitude	.
so	,	it	's	about	26	 degree 	 s 	 	.	you	ca	n't	see	it	from	over	there	.
step	three	is	identify	the	star	on	the	front	of	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
deneb	is	there	.	i	can	tell	.
step	four	is	i	then	move	the	 re 	 te 	 	,	move	the	sky	,	so	the	altitude	of	the	star	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	the	scale	on	the	back	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	lines	up	.
i	have	here	a	model	of	the	sky	that	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	the	real	sky	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
so	,	it	is	,	in	a	sense	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	a	model	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	in	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	take	a	rule	,	and	move	the	rule	to	a	date	line	which	then	 tell 	 s 	 	me	the	time	here	.
right	.	so	,	that	's	how	the	 de 	 vice 	 	is	used	.
so	,	i	know	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	:	``	that	's	a	lot	of	work	,	is	n't	it	?	is	n't	it	a	ton	of	work	to	be	able	to	tell	the	time	?	``
 a 	 s 	 	you	glance	at	your	ipod	to	just	check	out	the	time	.
but	there	is	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	two	,	 be 	 cause 	 	with	your	ipod	you	can	tell	--	or	your	iphone	,	you	can	tell	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	time	is	,	with	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	.
the	way	little	lewis	would	tell	the	time	is	by	a	picture	of	the	sky	.
he	would	know	where	 thing 	 s 	 	would	fit	in	the	sky	.
he	would	not	 on 	 ly 	 	know	what	time	it	was	,	he	would	 al 	 so 	 	know	where	the	 s 	 un 	 	would	rise	,	and	how	it	would	move	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sky	.
he	would	know	what	time	the	 s 	 un 	 	would	rise	,	and	what	time	it	would	set	.
and	he	would	know	that	for	 essential 	 ly 	 	every	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	object	in	the	 heaven 	 s 	 	.
so	,	in	computer	 graphic 	 s 	 	and	computer	user	 inter 	 face 	 	design	,	there	is	a	term	 call 	 ed 	 	 afford 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 afford 	 ance 	 s 	 	are	the	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	an	object	that	allow	us	to	perform	an	action	with	it	.
and	what	the	astrolabe	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	,	it	 afford 	 s 	 	us	,	to	connect	to	the	night	sky	,	to	look	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	night	sky	and	be	much	more	--	to	see	the	visible	and	the	 in 	 visible 	 	together	.
so	,	that	's	just	one	use	.	 in 	 credible 	 	,	there	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	350	,	400	uses	.
in	fact	,	there	is	a	text	,	and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	over	a	thousand	uses	of	 th 	 is 	 	first	computer	.
on	the	back	there	is	 scale 	 s 	 	and	 measure 	 ments 	 	for	terrestrial	 navig 	 ation 	 	.
you	can	survey	with	it	.	the	city	of	baghdad	was	 survey 	 ed 	 	with	it	.
it	can	be	used	for	 calcul 	 ating 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 equ 	 ations 	 	of	all	different	 type 	 s 	 	.
and	it	would	take	a	full	university	course	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	it	.
 astrolabe 	 s 	 	have	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
they	are	over	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 stereo 	 graphic 	 	 project 	 ion 	 	 origin 	 ated 	 	in	330	b.c	.
and	the	 astrolabe 	 s 	 	come	in	 man 	 y 	 	different	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	and	 shape 	 s 	 	and	 form 	 s 	 	.
there	is	 port 	 able 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.	there	is	large	 dis 	 play 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	what	is	common	to	all	 astrolabe 	 s 	 	is	that	they	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	.
there	is	a	quality	of	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 ship 	 	and	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	that	is	just	 astonish 	 ing 	 	and	 remark 	 able 	 	.
 astrolabe 	 s 	 	,	like	every	technology	,	do	evolve	over	time	.
so	,	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	 re 	 tes 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	and	primitive	.
and	 advanc 	 ing 	 	 re 	 tes 	 	 be 	 came 	 	cultural	 emblem 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	from	oxford	.
and	i	find	 th 	 is 	 	one	 re 	 ally 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 re 	 te 	 	pattern	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	,	and	it	 accurate 	 ly 	 	 map 	 s 	 	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 a 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	,	or	random	sky	.
how	cool	is	that	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	would	little	lewis	have	an	astrolabe	?
 prob 	 ably 	 	not	one	made	of	 bra 	 s 	 s 	 	.	he	would	have	one	made	out	of	wood	,	or	paper	.	and	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	first	computer	was	a	 port 	 able 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	that	you	could	keep	in	the	back	of	your	pocket	.
so	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	the	astrolabe	inspire	?
well	,	i	think	the	first	thing	is	that	it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	us	just	how	 resource 	 ful 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	,	our	 fore 	 bear 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	's	just	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
every	technology	 advance 	 s 	 	.
every	technology	is	 transform 	 ed 	 	and	 move 	 d 	 	by	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	gain	with	a	new	technology	,	of	course	,	is	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	and	 accu 	 racy 	 	.
but	what	we	lose	,	i	think	,	is	an	accurate	--	a	felt	sense	of	the	sky	,	a	sense	of	 con 	 text 	 	.
 know 	 ing 	 	the	sky	,	 know 	 ing 	 	your	relationship	with	the	sky	,	is	the	center	of	the	real	answer	to	 know 	 ing 	 	what	time	it	is	.
so	,	it	's	--	i	think	 astrolabe 	 s 	 	are	just	 remark 	 able 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	what	can	you	learn	from	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	?
well	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	that	there	is	a	subtle	knowledge	that	we	can	connect	with	the	world	.
and	 astrolabe 	 s 	 	return	us	to	 th 	 is 	 	subtle	sense	of	how	 thing 	 s 	 	all	fit	together	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	how	we	connect	to	the	world	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
