it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 re 	 ality 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	you	can	download	 product 	 s 	 	from	the	web	--	product	data	,	i	should	say	,	from	the	web	--	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	tweak	it	and	 personal 	 ize 	 	it	to	your	own	 pre 	 ference 	 	or	your	own	taste	,	and	have	that	information	 s 	 ent 	 	to	a	 desk 	 top 	 	machine	that	will	 fabric 	 ate 	 	it	for	you	on	the	spot	.
we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	build	for	you	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	a	physical	object	.
and	the	reason	we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	through	an	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	technology	 call 	 ed 	 	additive	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	,	or	3d	 print 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	3d	 print 	 er 	 	.
they	have	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 al 	 most 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	think	of	,	but	they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 start 	 ing 	 	to	filter	 in 	 to 	 	the	public	arena	.
and	 typical 	 ly 	 	,	you	would	take	data	,	like	the	data	of	a	pen	here	,	which	would	be	a	 geo 	 metric 	 	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	that	product	in	3d	,	and	we	would	pass	that	data	with	material	 in 	 to 	 	a	machine	.
and	a	process	that	would	happen	in	the	machine	would	mean	layer	by	layer	that	product	would	be	built	.
and	we	can	take	out	the	physical	product	,	and	ready	to	use	,	or	to	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	assemble	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
but	if	these	 machine 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 al 	 most 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	why	do	n't	we	know	about	them	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 typical 	 ly 	 	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	too	 in 	 efficient 	 	,	 in 	 access 	 ible 	 	,	they	've	not	 be 	 en 	 	fast	 en 	 ough 	 	,	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	expensive	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	is	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 re 	 ality 	 	that	they	are	now	 be 	 coming 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	are	 break 	 ing 	 	down	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	 guy 	 s 	 	will	soon	be	able	to	access	one	of	these	 machine 	 s 	 	,	if	not	 th 	 is 	 	minute	.
and	it	will	change	and	disrupt	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	,	and	most	 certain 	 ly 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	our	 business 	 es 	 	and	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	our	children	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
it	 typical 	 ly 	 	 read 	 s 	 	cad	data	,	which	is	a	product	design	data	 create 	 d 	 	on	professional	product	design	 program 	 s 	 	.
and	here	you	can	see	an	engineer	--	it	could	be	an	architect	or	it	could	be	a	professional	product	 design 	 er 	 	--	create	a	product	in	3d	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	data	 get 	 s 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	to	a	machine	that	 slice 	 s 	 	the	data	 in 	 to 	 	two	-	dimensional	 represent 	 ations 	 	of	that	product	all	the	way	through	--	 al 	 most 	 	like	 s 	 lic 	 ing 	 	it	like	 s 	 al 	 ami 	 	.
and	that	data	,	layer	by	layer	,	 get 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	through	the	machine	,	 start 	 ing 	 	at	the	base	of	the	product	and	 deposit 	 ing 	 	material	,	layer	 up 	 on 	 	layer	,	 in 	 fusing 	 	the	new	layer	of	 material 	 s 	 	to	the	old	layer	in	an	additive	process	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	material	that	's	 deposit 	 ed 	 	either	 start 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	liquid	form	or	a	material	powder	form	.
and	the	 bond 	 ing 	 	process	can	happen	by	either	 melt 	 ing 	 	and	 deposit 	 ing 	 	or	 deposit 	 ing 	 	then	 melt 	 ing 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	can	see	a	laser	 s 	 inter 	 ing 	 	machine	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	eos	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	using	a	laser	to	fuse	the	new	layer	of	material	to	the	old	layer	.
and	over	time	--	 quit 	 e 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	a	number	of	 hour 	 s 	 	--	we	can	build	a	physical	product	,	ready	to	take	out	of	the	machine	and	use	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	idea	,	but	it	is	 re 	 ality 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	all	these	 product 	 s 	 	that	you	can	see	on	the	screen	 we 	 re 	 	made	in	the	same	way	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	all	3d	 print 	 ed 	 	.
and	you	can	see	,	they	're	ranging	from	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	 ring 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	made	out	of	 stain 	 less 	 	steal	,	phone	 cover 	 s 	 	out	of	plastic	,	all	the	way	through	to	 spin 	 al 	 	 implant 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	 create 	 d 	 	out	of	medical	-	grade	 titan 	 ium 	 	,	and	engine	 part 	 s 	 	.
but	what	you	'll	notice	about	all	of	these	 product 	 s 	 	is	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 intric 	 ate 	 	.
the	design	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	taking	 th 	 is 	 	data	in	3d	form	,	 s 	 lic 	 ing 	 	it	up	before	it	 get 	 s 	 	past	the	machine	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	 structure 	 s 	 	that	are	more	 intric 	 ate 	 	than	any	other	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	technology	--	or	,	in	fact	,	are	 im 	 possible 	 	to	build	in	any	other	way	.
and	you	can	create	 part 	 s 	 	with	moving	 component 	 s 	 	,	 h 	 ing 	 es 	 	,	 part 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
so	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	we	can	abolish	 total 	 ly 	 	the	need	for	manual	labor	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	great	.
it	is	great	.
we	can	have	3d	 print 	 ers 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	build	 structure 	 s 	 	like	these	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 most 	 	three	 meter 	 s 	 	high	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	built	by	 deposit 	 ing 	 	artificial	 sand 	 stone 	 	layer	 up 	 on 	 	layer	in	 layer 	 s 	 	of	about	five	 millimeter 	 s 	 	to	10	mm	in	 thick 	 ness 	 	--	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	growing	 th 	 is 	 	structure	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 create 	 d 	 	by	an	 architect 	 ural 	 	firm	 call 	 ed 	 	shiro	.
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	walk	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	on	the	other	end	of	the	spectrum	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 micro 	 structure 	 	.
it	's	 create 	 d 	 	 deposit 	 ing 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	of	about	four	 micro 	 ns 	 	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 re 	 solution 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
the	detail	that	you	can	get	 to 	 day 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
so	who	's	using	it	?
 typical 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	create	 product 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	used	by	product	 design 	 ers 	 	,	or	 any 	 one 	 	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	prototype	a	product	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	create	or	reiterate	a	design	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	technology	 a 	 s 	 	well	is	that	you	can	create	 be 	 spoke 	 	 product 	 s 	 	en	masse	.
there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	little	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	of	scale	.
so	you	can	now	create	one	-	offs	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
 architect 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	they	want	to	create	 prototype 	 s 	 	of	 building 	 s 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	you	can	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	building	of	the	free	university	in	berlin	and	it	was	designed	by	foster	and	 partner 	 s 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	not	 build 	 able 	 	in	any	other	way	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	even	create	 th 	 is 	 	by	hand	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	engine	component	.
it	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	3t	rpd	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	with	the	design	.
now	3d	 print 	 ing 	 	can	break	away	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	in	design	which	 challeng 	 e 	 	the	 constraint 	 s 	 	of	mass	production	.
if	we	slice	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	product	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	,	you	can	see	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	number	of	 cool 	 ing 	 	 channel 	 s 	 	pass	through	it	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	it	's	a	more	efficient	product	.
you	ca	n't	create	 th 	 is 	 	with	standard	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	even	if	you	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	 manual 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	more	efficient	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	now	create	all	these	 cav 	 ities 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	object	that	cool	fluid	.
and	it	's	used	by	 aero 	 space 	 	and	 auto 	 motive 	 	.
it	's	a	 light 	 er 	 	part	and	it	uses	less	material	waste	.
so	it	's	 over 	 all 	 	performance	and	efficiency	just	 exceed 	 s 	 	standard	mass	 produce 	 d 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
and	then	taking	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	creating	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	structure	,	we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	it	to	 honey 	 comb 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	and	use	them	 with 	 in 	 	 implant 	 s 	 	.
 typical 	 ly 	 	an	implant	is	more	effective	 with 	 in 	 	the	body	if	it	's	more	 por 	 ous 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	our	body	tissue	will	grow	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
there	's	a	lower	chance	of	 reject 	 ion 	 	.
but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	create	that	in	standard	ways	.
with	3d	 print 	 ing 	 	,	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	we	can	create	much	better	 implant 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	create	 be 	 spoke 	 	 product 	 s 	 	en	masse	,	one	-	offs	,	we	can	create	 implant 	 s 	 	that	are	specific	to	 individual 	 s 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	technology	and	the	quality	of	what	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 machine 	 s 	 	is	fantastic	.
and	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	it	 be 	 ing 	 	used	for	final	end	 product 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	detail	is	 improv 	 ing 	 	,	the	quality	is	 improv 	 ing 	 	,	the	price	of	the	 machine 	 s 	 	are	 fall 	 ing 	 	and	they	're	 be 	 coming 	 	 quick 	 er 	 	.
they	're	 al 	 so 	 	now	small	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	on	a	 desk 	 top 	 	.
you	can	buy	a	machine	 to 	 day 	 	for	about	$	300	that	you	can	create	 your 	 self 	 	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
but	then	it	 beg 	 s 	 	the	question	,	why	do	n't	we	all	have	one	in	our	home	?
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	most	of	us	here	 to 	 day 	 	do	n't	know	how	to	create	the	data	that	a	3d	 print 	 er 	 	 read 	 s 	 	.
if	i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	a	3d	 print 	 er 	 	,	you	would	n't	know	how	to	direct	it	to	make	what	you	want	it	to	.
but	there	are	more	and	more	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	and	 process 	 es 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	are	 break 	 ing 	 	down	 t 	 hose 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	're	at	a	 tip 	 ping 	 	point	where	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	ca	n't	avoid	.
 th 	 is 	 	technology	is	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	disrupt	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	and	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	cause	a	revolution	in	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	can	download	 product 	 s 	 	from	the	web	--	 any 	 thing 	 	you	would	have	on	your	 desk 	 top 	 	,	like	 pen 	 s 	 	,	 whistl 	 es 	 	,	lemon	 squeez 	 ers 	 	.
you	can	use	 soft 	 ware 	 	like	google	sketchup	to	create	 product 	 s 	 	from	scratch	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
3d	 print 	 ing 	 	can	be	 al 	 so 	 	used	to	download	spare	 part 	 s 	 	from	the	web	.
so	imagine	you	have	,	say	,	a	 ho 	 over 	 	in	your	home	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	broken	down	.	you	need	a	spare	part	,	but	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 ho 	 over 	 	's	 be 	 en 	 	 dis 	 continu 	 ed 	 	.
can	you	imagine	going	 on 	 line 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ality 	 	--	and	 find 	 ing 	 	that	spare	part	from	a	 data 	 base 	 	of	 geo 	 me 	 tries 	 	of	that	 dis 	 continu 	 ed 	 	product	and	 download 	 ing 	 	that	information	,	that	data	,	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	product	made	for	you	at	home	,	ready	to	use	,	on	your	demand	?
and	in	fact	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	create	spare	 part 	 s 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	the	 machine 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	making	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	 fabric 	 ate 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
these	are	 part 	 s 	 	of	a	reprap	machine	,	which	is	a	kind	of	 desk 	 top 	 	 print 	 er 	 	.
but	what	 interest 	 s 	 	my	company	the	most	is	the	fact	that	you	can	create	individual	 un 	 ique 	 	 product 	 s 	 	en	masse	.
there	's	no	need	to	do	a	run	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	or	 s 	 end 	 	that	product	to	be	 inject 	 ion 	 	 mold 	 ed 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
you	can	just	make	it	 physical 	 ly 	 	on	the	spot	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	can	now	present	to	the	public	the	next	generation	of	 custom 	 ization 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	now	possible	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	you	can	direct	 personal 	 ly 	 	how	you	want	your	 product 	 s 	 	to	look	.
we	're	all	familiar	with	the	idea	of	 custom 	 ization 	 	or	 personal 	 ization 	 	.
 brand 	 s 	 	like	nike	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
it	's	all	over	the	web	.
in	fact	,	every	major	 house 	 hold 	 	name	is	 allow 	 ing 	 	you	to	interact	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 product 	 s 	 	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	--	all	the	way	from	smart	 car 	 s 	 	to	prada	to	ray	ban	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	mass	 custom 	 ization 	 	;	it	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	 vari 	 ant 	 	production	,	 vari 	 ations 	 	of	the	same	product	.
what	you	could	do	is	 re 	 ally 	 	influence	your	product	now	and	shape	-	 manipul 	 ate 	 	your	product	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	about	you	 guy 	 s 	 	,	but	i	've	had	 experience 	 s 	 	when	i	've	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	store	and	i	've	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	've	 want 	 ed 	 	and	i	've	 search 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	for	that	perfect	lamp	that	i	know	where	i	want	to	 s 	 it 	 	in	my	house	and	i	just	ca	n't	find	the	right	thing	,	or	that	perfect	piece	of	 jewel 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	gift	or	for	 my 	 self 	 	.
imagine	that	you	can	now	engage	with	a	brand	and	interact	,	so	that	you	can	pass	your	personal	 attribut 	 es 	 	to	the	 product 	 s 	 	that	you	're	about	to	buy	.
you	can	 to 	 day 	 	download	a	product	with	 soft 	 ware 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	view	the	product	in	3d	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sort	of	3d	data	that	a	machine	will	read	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	lamp	.
and	you	can	start	 ite 	 rating 	 	the	design	.
you	can	direct	what	color	that	product	will	be	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	what	material	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	you	can	engage	in	shape	 manipul 	 ation 	 	of	that	product	,	but	 with 	 in 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	that	are	safe	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	public	are	not	professional	product	 design 	 ers 	 	.
the	piece	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	will	keep	an	individual	 with 	 in 	 	the	 bound 	 s 	 	of	the	possible	.
and	when	 some 	 body 	 	is	ready	to	purchase	the	product	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 personal 	 ized 	 	design	,	they	click	``	enter	``	and	 th 	 is 	 	data	 get 	 s 	 	 convert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	data	that	a	3d	 print 	 er 	 	 read 	 s 	 	and	 get 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	to	a	3d	 print 	 er 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	on	 some 	 one 	 	's	 desk 	 top 	 	.
but	i	do	n't	think	that	that	's	 im 	 mediate 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	that	will	happen	soon	.
what	's	more	 like 	 ly 	 	,	and	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	it	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	that	data	 get 	 s 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	to	a	local	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	center	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	lower	carbon	 foot 	 print 	 	.
we	're	now	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 ship 	 ping 	 	a	product	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	we	're	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	data	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
here	's	the	product	 be 	 ing 	 	built	.
you	can	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	came	out	of	the	machine	in	one	piece	and	the	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 insert 	 ed 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	lamp	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	here	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	have	the	data	,	you	can	create	the	part	on	demand	.
and	you	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	need	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	for	just	aesthetic	 custom 	 ization 	 	,	you	can	use	it	for	functional	 custom 	 ization 	 	,	 s 	 canning 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	body	and	creating	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	made	to	fit	.
so	we	can	run	 th 	 is 	 	through	to	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 prost 	 hetic 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 high 	 ly 	 	 special 	 ized 	 	to	an	individual	's	handicap	.
or	we	can	create	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 prost 	 hetic 	 s 	 	for	that	individual	.
 s 	 canning 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	can	have	your	 tee 	 th 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	and	 dent 	 al 	 	 co 	 ating 	 s 	 	made	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	to	fit	you	.
while	you	wait	at	the	 dent 	 ist 	 	,	a	machine	will	 quiet 	 ly 	 	be	creating	 th 	 is 	 	for	you	ready	to	insert	in	the	 tee 	 th 	 	.
and	the	idea	of	now	creating	 implant 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 canning 	 	data	,	an	mri	 s 	 can 	 	of	 some 	 body 	 	can	now	be	 convert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	3d	data	and	we	can	create	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 implant 	 s 	 	for	them	.
and	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	idea	of	building	up	what	's	in	our	bodies	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	pair	of	 lung 	 s 	 	and	the	 bronchi 	 al 	 	tree	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 intric 	 ate 	 	.
you	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	create	 th 	 is 	 	or	 simul 	 ate 	 	it	in	any	other	way	.
but	with	mri	data	,	we	can	just	build	the	product	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 intric 	 ate 	 ly 	 	.
using	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	 pioneer 	 s 	 	in	the	industry	are	 layer 	 ing 	 	up	 cell 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	one	of	the	 pioneer 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	dr.	anthony	atala	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 layer 	 ing 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	to	create	body	 part 	 s 	 	--	 bladder 	 s 	 	,	 val 	 ves 	 	,	 kid 	 ney 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	ready	for	the	public	,	but	it	is	in	 work 	 ing 	 	progress	.
so	just	to	 final 	 ize 	 	,	we	're	all	individual	.
we	all	have	different	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	different	 need 	 s 	 	.
we	like	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	're	all	different	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	and	our	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	the	same	.
 business 	 es 	 	want	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	a	doubt	in	my	mind	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	technology	is	going	to	cause	a	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	revolution	and	will	change	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	.
thank	you	.
