so	i	think	data	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	us	more	human	.
we	're	 collect 	 ing 	 	and	creating	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	data	about	how	we	're	living	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 enabl 	 ing 	 	us	to	tell	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	a	wise	media	 theor 	 ist 	 	tweeted	,	``	the	19th	century	culture	was	defined	by	the	novel	,	the	20th	century	culture	was	defined	by	the	cinema	,	and	the	culture	of	the	21st	century	will	be	defined	by	the	 inter 	 face 	 	.	``
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	prove	true	.
our	 live 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	driven	by	data	,	and	the	 present 	 ation 	 	of	that	data	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	us	to	make	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	that	tell	great	 st 	 ories 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	few	of	the	 project 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	over	the	last	couple	 year 	 s 	 	that	reflect	on	our	 live 	 s 	 	and	our	 system 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	 call 	 ed 	 	flight	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
what	you	're	looking	at	is	 air 	 plane 	 	traffic	over	north	america	for	a	24	-	hour	period	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	see	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	 fad 	 e 	 	to	black	,	and	you	see	people	going	to	sleep	.
 follow 	 ed 	 	by	that	,	you	see	on	the	west	coast	 plane 	 s 	 	moving	 a 	 cross 	 	,	the	red	-	eye	 flight 	 s 	 	to	the	east	coast	.
and	you	'll	see	 every 	 body 	 	 wa 	 king 	 	up	on	the	east	coast	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	european	 flight 	 s 	 	coming	in	the	upper	right	-	hand	corner	.
 every 	 body 	 	's	moving	from	the	east	coast	to	the	west	coast	.
you	see	san	francisco	and	los	angeles	start	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 journey 	 s 	 	down	to	hawaii	in	the	lower	left	-	hand	corner	.
i	think	it	's	one	thing	to	say	there	's	140,000	 plane 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 monitor 	 ed 	 	by	the	federal	government	at	any	one	time	,	and	it	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	to	see	that	system	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ebb 	 s 	 	and	 flow 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	time	-	lapse	image	of	that	exact	same	data	,	but	i	've	color	-	 cod 	 ed 	 	it	by	type	,	so	you	can	see	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 air 	 craft 	 	that	are	in	the	 ski 	 es 	 	above	us	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	making	these	,	and	i	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	google	 map 	 s 	 	and	allow	you	to	zoom	in	and	see	individual	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	and	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	are	 occur 	 ring 	 	there	.
so	here	we	can	see	the	white	 represent 	 s 	 	low	 altitude 	 s 	 	,	and	the	blue	are	 high 	 er 	 	 altitude 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	zoom	in	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	taking	a	look	at	atlanta	.
you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	major	 ship 	 ping 	 	 air 	 port 	 	,	and	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	activity	there	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	toggle	between	altitude	for	model	and	 manufactur 	 er 	 	.
see	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
and	you	can	scroll	around	and	see	some	of	the	different	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	and	the	different	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	they	have	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 scroll 	 ing 	 	up	the	east	coast	.
you	can	see	some	of	the	 cha 	 os 	 	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	new	york	with	the	air	traffic	 controll 	 ers 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	deal	with	all	 t 	 hose 	 	major	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	next	to	each	other	.
so	 zoom 	 ing 	 	back	out	real	quick	,	we	see	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	u.s.	--	you	get	florida	down	in	the	right	-	hand	corner	.
moving	 a 	 cross 	 	to	the	west	coast	,	you	see	san	francisco	and	los	angeles	--	big	low	-	traffic	 zone 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	nevada	and	arizona	.
and	that	's	us	down	there	in	l.a.	and	long	beach	on	the	bottom	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	a	look	 a 	 s 	 	well	at	different	 peri 	 meter 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	 choos 	 e 	 	what	you	want	to	pull	out	from	the	data	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	looking	at	 ascend 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 descend 	 ing 	 	 flight 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	see	,	over	time	,	the	ways	the	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	change	.
you	see	the	 hold 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	start	to	develop	in	the	bottom	of	the	screen	.
and	you	can	see	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	the	 air 	 port 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 flip 	 s 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	project	that	i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	with	the	 sens 	 ible 	 	cities	lab	at	mit	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 visual 	 izing 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	how	new	york	 communicate 	 s 	 	with	other	 inter 	 national 	 	cities	.
and	we	set	 th 	 is 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	live	 glob 	 e 	 	in	the	museum	of	modern	art	in	new	york	for	the	design	the	elastic	mind	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	.
and	it	had	a	live	feed	with	a	24	-	hour	 off 	 set 	 	,	so	you	could	see	the	changing	relationship	and	some	 demo 	 graphic 	 	info	coming	through	at	&	t	's	data	and	 reveal 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	project	i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	with	 sens 	 ible 	 	cities	lab	and	currentcity.org	.
and	it	's	 visual 	 izing 	 	sms	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	in	the	city	of	amsterdam	.
so	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	ebb	and	flow	of	people	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	sms	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	from	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	city	,	 un 	 til 	 	we	approach	new	year	's	eve	,	where	 every 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	happy	new	year	!	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 inter 	 active 	 	tool	that	you	can	move	around	and	see	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	city	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	looking	at	 an 	 other 	 	event	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 que 	 en 	 	's	day	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	ebb	and	flow	of	people	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	sms	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	from	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	city	.
and	then	you	're	going	to	see	people	start	to	gather	in	the	center	of	the	city	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	night	before	,	which	 happen 	 s 	 	right	here	.
and	then	you	can	see	people	 celebr 	 ating 	 	the	next	day	.
and	you	can	pause	it	and	step	back	and	forth	and	see	different	 phase 	 s 	 	.
so	now	on	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
some	of	you	may	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	baron	wolfgang	von	kempelen	's	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 ches 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	machine	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	robot	that	 play 	 s 	 	 ches 	 s 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	one	thing	:	it	's	not	a	robot	at	all	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 leg 	 less 	 	man	that	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	in	that	box	and	 control 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ches 	 s 	 	player	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	inspiration	for	a	web	service	by	amazon	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	turk	--	named	after	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
and	it	's	based	on	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	that	there	are	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	easy	for	people	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	for	 computer 	 s 	 	.
so	they	made	 th 	 is 	 	web	service	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	any	 programm 	 er 	 	can	write	a	piece	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	and	tap	 in 	 to 	 	the	 mind 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.	``
the	 nerd 	 y 	 	side	of	me	thought	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
i	can	tap	 in 	 to 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	's	 mind 	 s 	 	.	``
and	the	other	 nerd 	 y 	 	side	of	me	thought	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 horr 	 ible 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	bizarre	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	for	the	future	of	 man 	 kind 	 	,	where	we	're	all	 plug 	 ged 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	borg	?	``
i	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	little	 extrem 	 e 	 	.
but	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	when	we	have	no	 con 	 text 	 	for	what	it	is	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	and	we	're	just	 do 	 ing 	 	these	little	 labor 	 s 	 	?
so	i	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	tool	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	draw	a	sheep	facing	to	the	left	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	pay	you	two	 cent 	 s 	 	for	your	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	.	``
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	sheep	.
and	i	 collect 	 ed 	 	a	lot	,	a	lot	of	different	sheep	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	sheep	.
i	took	the	first	10,000	sheep	that	i	 collect 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	put	them	on	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	thesheepmarket.com	where	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	buy	 collect 	 ions 	 	of	20	sheep	.
you	ca	n't	pick	individual	sheep	,	but	you	can	buy	a	single	plate	block	of	 stamp 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 commodit 	 y 	 	.
and	 juxta 	 posed 	 	against	 th 	 is 	 	grid	,	you	see	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	by	 roll 	 ing 	 	over	each	individual	one	,	the	 human 	 ity 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 huge 	 ly 	 	 mechanic 	 al 	 	process	.
i	think	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	 watch 	 ing 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	through	 th 	 is 	 	creative	toil	--	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	all	 re 	 late 	 	to	,	 th 	 is 	 	creative	process	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	from	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
i	think	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	 juxta 	 pose 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 th 	 is 	 	massive	 distribut 	 ed 	 	grid	.
kind	of	 amaz 	 ing 	 	what	some	people	did	.
so	here	's	a	few	 statistic 	 s 	 	from	the	project	.
approximate	 collect 	 ion 	 	rate	of	11	sheep	per	hour	,	which	would	make	a	 work 	 ing 	 	wage	of	69	 cent 	 s 	 	per	hour	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	662	 reject 	 ed 	 	sheep	that	did	n't	meet	``	sheep	-	like	``	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	and	 we 	 re 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	out	of	the	flock	.
the	amount	of	time	 s 	 pent 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	 rang 	 ed 	 	from	four	 second 	 s 	 	to	46	 minute 	 s 	 	.
that	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	idea	of	the	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 motiv 	 ations 	 	and	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	7,599	people	that	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	the	project	,	or	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	ip	 address 	 es 	 	--	so	about	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	.
but	 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	them	out	of	the	7,599	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
which	i	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	by	.
i	 expect 	 ed 	 	people	to	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	did	i	draw	a	sheep	?	``
and	i	think	it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	valid	question	.
and	there	's	a	lot	of	 reason 	 s 	 	why	i	chose	sheep	.
sheep	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	animal	to	be	raised	from	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	 process 	 ed 	 	 by 	 product 	 s 	 	,	the	first	to	be	 select 	 ively 	 	 br 	 ed 	 	for	production	 trait 	 s 	 	,	the	first	animal	to	be	 clon 	 ed 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	we	think	of	sheep	 a 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ers 	 	.
and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ference 	 	to	``	le	petit	prince	``	where	the	 nar 	 rator 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	the	prince	to	draw	a	sheep	.
he	 draw 	 s 	 	sheep	after	sheep	.
the	 nar 	 rator 	 	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 app 	 eas 	 ed 	 	when	he	 draw 	 s 	 	a	box	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	it	's	not	about	a	scientific	 render 	 ing 	 	of	a	sheep	.
it	's	about	your	own	 interpret 	 ation 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.	``
and	i	like	that	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	clip	from	charlie	chaplin	's	``	modern	 time 	 s 	 	.	``
it	's	 show 	 ing 	 	charlie	chaplin	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	some	of	the	major	 change 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	industrial	revolution	.
so	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	shoe	makers	,	but	now	there	are	people	 s 	 lap 	 ping 	 	 sole 	 s 	 	on	people	's	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
and	the	whole	idea	of	one	's	relationship	to	 the 	 ir 	 	work	 change 	 d 	 	a	lot	.
so	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	clip	to	divide	 in 	 to 	 	16	 piece 	 s 	 	and	feed	 in 	 to 	 	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	turk	with	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	tool	.
 th 	 is 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	--	what	you	see	on	the	left	side	is	the	original	frame	,	and	on	the	right	side	you	see	that	frame	 a 	 s 	 	 interpret 	 ed 	 	by	16	people	who	have	no	idea	what	it	is	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	inspiration	for	a	project	that	i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	with	my	friend	takashi	kawashima	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	use	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	turk	for	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	it	was	 me 	 ant 	 	for	,	which	is	making	money	.
so	we	took	a	hundred	dollar	bill	and	 divid 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	10,000	 teen 	 y 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	,	and	we	fed	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	turk	.
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	draw	what	it	was	that	they	saw	.
but	here	there	was	no	sheep	-	like	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	.
people	,	if	they	drew	a	stick	figure	or	a	smiley	face	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	bill	.
so	what	you	see	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	how	well	people	did	what	it	was	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
so	we	took	these	hundred	dollar	 bill 	 s 	 	,	and	we	put	them	on	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	tenthousandscents.com	,	where	you	can	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	through	and	see	all	the	individual	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	trade	real	hundred	-	dollar	 bill 	 s 	 	for	fake	hundred	-	dollar	 bill 	 s 	 	and	make	a	 don 	 ation 	 	to	the	hundred	dollar	 lap 	 top 	 	project	,	which	is	now	known	 a 	 s 	 	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 aga 	 in 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	all	the	different	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	.
you	see	some	people	did	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 stipp 	 le 	 	 render 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	on	top	--	 s 	 pent 	 	a	long	time	making	realistic	 version 	 s 	 	.
and	other	people	would	draw	stick	 figure 	 s 	 	or	smiley	 face 	 s 	 	.
here	on	the	right	-	hand	side	in	the	middle	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	one	guy	writing	,	``	$	0.01	!	!	!	 re 	 ally 	 	?	``
that	's	all	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	paid	for	 th 	 is 	 	?
so	the	last	 mechanic 	 al 	 	turk	project	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 bi 	 cycle 	 	built	for	2000	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	my	friend	daniel	massey	.
you	may	 recogn 	 ize 	 	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	max	mathews	and	john	kelly	from	bell	 lab 	 s 	 	in	the	'60s	,	where	they	 create 	 d 	 	the	song	``	 dai 	 s 	 y 	 	bell	,	``	which	was	the	world	's	first	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	computer	.
you	may	 recogn 	 ize 	 	it	from	``	2001	:	a	space	odyssey	.	``
when	hal	's	 dy 	 ing 	 	at	the	end	of	the	film	he	 start 	 s 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	song	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ference 	 	to	when	 computer 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	human	.
so	we	 re 	 synthesize 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	song	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	that	 sound 	 ed 	 	like	.
we	broke	down	all	the	individual	 note 	 s 	 	in	the	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 phone 	 me 	 s 	 	in	the	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	.
 dai 	 s 	 y 	 	bell	:	♫	 dai 	 s 	 y 	 	,	 dai 	 s 	 y 	 	...	♫	aaron	koblin	:	and	we	took	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	individual	 piece 	 s 	 	,	and	we	fed	them	 in 	 to 	 	 an 	 other 	 	turk	request	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	would	look	like	if	you	went	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
you	type	in	your	code	,	but	you	first	test	your	mic	.
you	'd	be	fed	a	simple	audio	clip	.
and	then	you	'd	do	your	best	to	 re 	 create 	 	that	with	your	own	voice	.
after	 pre 	 view 	 ing 	 	it	and	 confirm 	 ing 	 	it	's	what	you	 submit 	 ted 	 	,	you	could	submit	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	turk	with	no	other	 con 	 text 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	first	got	back	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	set	of	 sub 	 mission 	 s 	 	.

 chor 	 us 	 	:	♫	 dai 	 s 	 y 	 	,	 dai 	 s 	 y 	 	♫	♫	give	me	your	answer	do	♫	♫	i	'm	half	crazy	♫	♫	all	for	the	love	of	you	♫	♫	it	ca	n't	be	a	 styl 	 ish 	 	marriage	♫	♫	i	ca	n't	afford	a	carriage	♫	♫	but	you	'd	look	sweet	 up 	 on 	 	the	seat	♫	♫	of	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	built	for	two	♫	ak	:	so	 step 	 ping 	 	back	for	a	quick	second	,	when	i	was	at	ucla	going	to	grad	school	,	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	at	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	the	center	for	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	network	 sens 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	was	writing	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	laser	 scanner 	 s 	 	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	motion	through	3d	space	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 s 	 een 	 	by	a	director	in	l.a.	named	james	frost	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	wait	a	minute	.
you	mean	we	can	shoot	a	music	video	 with 	 out 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	using	any	video	?	``
so	we	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	.
we	made	a	music	video	for	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 band 	 s 	 	,	radiohead	.
and	i	think	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	was	not	just	 shoot 	 ing 	 	a	video	with	 laser 	 s 	 	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	open	sourced	it	,	and	we	made	it	released	 a 	 s 	 	a	google	code	project	,	where	people	could	download	a	bunch	of	the	data	and	some	source	code	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 version 	 s 	 	of	it	.
and	people	 we 	 re 	 	making	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	two	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	:	the	pin	-	board	thom	yorke	and	a	lego	thom	yorke	.
a	whole	youtube	channel	of	people	 submit 	 ting 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	content	.
more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 body 	 	even	3d	-	 print 	 ed 	 	thom	yorke	's	head	,	which	is	a	little	 creep 	 y 	 	,	but	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.
so	with	 every 	 body 	 	making	so	much	 amaz 	 ing 	 	stuff	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	it	was	they	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	 collabor 	 ative 	 	project	where	people	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	to	build	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	met	a	music	video	director	named	chris	milk	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 bounc 	 ing 	 	around	 idea 	 s 	 	to	make	a	 collabor 	 ative 	 	music	video	project	.
but	we	 k 	 new 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	the	right	person	to	kind	of	 r 	 ally 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	and	build	 some 	 thing 	 	for	.
so	we	put	the	idea	on	the	back	 burn 	 er 	 	for	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	rick	rubin	,	who	was	 finish 	 ing 	 	up	johnny	cash	's	final	 al 	 bum 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	ai	n't	no	grave	.	``
the	 lyric 	 s 	 	to	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	track	are	``	ai	n't	no	grave	can	hold	my	body	down	.	``
so	we	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	perfect	project	to	build	a	 collabor 	 ative 	 	memorial	and	a	virtual	 resurrect 	 ion 	 	for	johnny	cash	.
so	i	 team 	 ed 	 	up	with	my	good	friend	ricardo	cabello	,	 al 	 so 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	mr.	 do 	 ob 	 	,	who	's	a	much	better	 programm 	 er 	 	than	i	am	,	and	he	made	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	flash	 draw 	 ing 	 	tool	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	an	 anim 	 ation 	 	is	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	did	was	cross	-	cut	a	bunch	of	 archiv 	 al 	 	 foot 	 age 	 	of	johnny	cash	,	and	at	eight	 frame 	 s 	 	a	second	,	we	 allow 	 ed 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	to	draw	a	single	frame	that	would	get	 wove 	 n 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 dynamic 	 ally 	 	changing	music	video	.
so	i	do	n't	have	time	to	play	the	entire	thing	for	you	,	but	i	want	to	show	you	two	short	 clip 	 s 	 	.
one	is	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	music	video	.
and	that	's	going	to	be	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	a	short	clip	of	people	who	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	the	project	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	 brief 	 ly 	 	.
johnny	cash	:	♫	there	ai	n't	no	grave	♫	♫	can	hold	my	body	down	♫	♫	there	ai	n't	no	grave	♫	♫	can	hold	body	down	♫	♫	when	i	hear	the	 trump 	 et 	 	sound	♫	♫	i	'm	going	to	ride	right	out	of	the	ground	♫	♫	ai	n't	no	grave	♫	♫	can	hold	my	body	...	♫	ak	:	what	better	way	to	pay	tribute	to	the	man	than	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	for	one	of	his	 song 	 s 	 	.
 collabor 	 ator 	 	:	i	felt	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	when	he	 di 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	just	thought	it	'd	be	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	it	'd	be	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	his	 memor 	 y 	 	.
 collabor 	 ator 	 	two	:	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	last	 record 	 ing 	 	of	his	to	be	a	living	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	memorial	.
 collabor 	 ator 	 	three	:	for	all	of	the	 frame 	 s 	 	to	be	drawn	by	 fan 	 s 	 	,	each	individual	frame	,	it	's	got	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	to	it	.
 collabor 	 ator 	 	four	:	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 every 	 body 	 	from	japan	,	venezuela	,	to	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	to	knoxville	,	tennessee	.
 collabor 	 ator 	 	five	:	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	is	different	from	frame	to	frame	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	personal	.
 collabor 	 ator 	 	six	:	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	video	in	my	room	,	i	could	see	me	not	 understand 	 ing 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	it	.
and	i	just	 work 	 ed 	 	and	 work 	 ed 	 	through	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	my	little	wee	 battle 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 fight 	 ing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	picture	all	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 re 	 solve 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	the	point	when	i	know	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	a	lot	of	light	and	dark	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	in	a	weird	way	,	that	's	what	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	about	johnny	cash	's	music	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
it	's	the	sum	total	of	his	life	,	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	the	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	good	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	a	person	's	life	.
ak	:	so	if	you	go	to	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	johnnycashproject.com	,	what	you	'll	see	is	the	video	 play 	 ing 	 	above	.
and	 be 	 low 	 	it	are	all	the	individual	 frame 	 s 	 	that	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 submit 	 ting 	 	to	the	project	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 finish 	 ed 	 	at	all	,	but	it	's	an	 on 	 going 	 	project	where	people	can	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	.
if	you	roll	over	any	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	individual	 thumb 	 nail 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	the	person	who	drew	that	individual	 thumb 	 nail 	 	and	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 locate 	 d 	 	.
and	if	you	find	one	that	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	click	on	it	and	open	up	an	information	 pan 	 el 	 	where	you	're	able	to	rate	that	frame	,	which	 help 	 s 	 	it	bubble	up	to	the	top	.
and	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	the	way	that	it	was	drawn	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	can	get	the	 play 	 back 	 	and	personal	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	,	it	's	 list 	 ed 	 	,	the	artist	's	name	,	the	location	,	how	long	they	 s 	 pent 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	you	can	pick	a	style	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	one	was	 tag 	 ged 	 	``	abstract	.	``
but	there	's	a	bunch	of	different	 style 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	sort	the	video	a	number	of	different	ways	.
you	can	say	,	``	i	want	to	see	the	 point 	 ill 	 ist 	 	version	or	the	 sketch 	 y 	 	version	or	the	realistic	version	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	abstract	version	,	which	 end 	 s 	 	up	 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	bit	crazy	.
so	the	last	project	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	is	 an 	 other 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	chris	milk	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	 down 	 town 	 	.	``
it	's	an	 on 	 line 	 	music	video	for	the	arcade	fire	.
chris	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	by	the	potential	now	with	modern	web	 brow 	 s 	 ers 	 	,	where	you	have	html	5	audio	and	video	and	the	power	of	javascript	to	render	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	fast	.
and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	push	the	idea	of	the	music	video	that	was	 me 	 ant 	 	for	the	web	beyond	the	four	-	by	-	three	or	sixteen	-	by	-	nine	window	and	try	to	make	it	play	out	and	choreograph	 through 	 out 	 	the	screen	.
but	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	an	experience	that	was	 un 	 like 	 	the	johnny	cash	project	,	where	you	had	a	small	group	of	people	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	time	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
what	if	we	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	but	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 individual 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	to	each	person	who	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	?
so	the	project	 start 	 s 	 	off	by	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	to	enter	the	address	of	the	home	where	you	grew	up	.
and	you	type	in	the	address	--	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 s 	 	a	music	video	 specific 	 ally 	 	for	you	,	 pull 	 ing 	 	in	google	 map 	 s 	 	and	streetview	 image 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	experience	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	should	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 s 	 een 	 	at	home	with	you	 ty 	 ping 	 	in	your	own	address	,	but	i	'm	going	to	give	you	a	little	 pre 	 view 	 	of	what	you	can	expect	.
win	 but 	 ler 	 	:	♫	now	our	 live 	 s 	 	are	changing	fast	♫	♫	now	our	 live 	 s 	 	are	changing	fast	♫	♫	hope	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	can	last	♫	♫	hope	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	can	last	♫	♫	ooh	we	used	to	wait	♫	♫	ooh	we	used	to	wait	♫	♫	ooh	we	used	to	wait	♫	♫	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	never	came	♫	♫	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	never	came	♫	♫	still	moving	through	the	pain	♫	♫	we	used	to	wait	for	it	♫	♫	we	used	to	wait	for	it	♫	♫	we	used	to	wait	for	it	♫	ak	:	so	i	think	,	if	there	's	one	thing	to	take	away	from	my	talk	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	's	that	an	 inter 	 face 	 	can	be	a	 power 	 ful 	 	narrative	 de 	 vice 	 	.
