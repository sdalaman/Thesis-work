i	'm	a	process	engineer	.
i	know	all	about	 boil 	 ers 	 	and	incinerators	and	fabric	 filter 	 s 	 	and	cyclones	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	marfan	syndrome	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 inherit 	 ed 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	.
and	in	1992	i	 particip 	 ated 	 	in	a	genetic	 stud 	 y 	 	and	found	to	my	 horr 	 or 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	from	the	slide	,	that	my	 ascend 	 ing 	 	aorta	was	not	in	the	normal	range	,	the	green	line	at	the	bottom	.
 every 	 one 	 	in	here	will	be	between	3.2	and	3.6	cm	.
i	was	 al 	 ready 	 	up	at	4.4	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	my	aorta	dilated	 progress 	 ively 	 	,	and	i	got	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	point	where	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	was	going	to	be	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
the	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	on	 off 	 er 	 	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	gruesome	--	 anesthet 	 ize 	 	you	,	open	your	chest	,	put	you	on	an	artificial	heart	and	lung	machine	,	drop	your	body	temperature	to	about	18	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	,	stop	your	heart	,	cut	the	aorta	out	,	replace	it	with	a	plastic	 val 	 ve 	 	and	a	plastic	aorta	,	and	,	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	commit	you	to	a	 life 	 time 	 	of	anticoagulation	therapy	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	warfarin	.
the	thought	of	the	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	was	not	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
the	thought	of	the	warfarin	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	'm	an	engineer	,	i	'm	in	r	and	d	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	 plumb 	 ing 	 	problem	.
i	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	can	change	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	i	set	out	to	change	the	entire	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	aortic	 dil 	 ation 	 	.
the	project	aim	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	simple	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	real	problem	with	the	 ascend 	 ing 	 	aorta	in	people	with	marfan	syndrome	is	it	 lack 	 s 	 	some	 ten 	 s 	 ile 	 	strength	.
so	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	to	 simpl 	 y 	 	 external 	 ly 	 	wrap	the	pipe	.
and	it	would	remain	 s 	 table 	 	and	 oper 	 ate 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	.
if	your	high	-	pressure	hose	pipe	,	or	your	high	-	pressure	 hyd 	 raulic 	 	line	,	 bulg 	 es 	 	a	little	,	you	just	wrap	some	tape	around	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	it	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	that	simple	in	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	not	in	 exec 	 ution 	 	.
the	great	advantage	of	an	external	support	for	me	was	that	i	could	retain	all	of	my	own	bits	,	all	of	my	own	endothelium	and	 val 	 ves 	 	,	and	not	need	any	anticoagulation	therapy	.
so	where	do	we	start	?
well	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	sagittal	slice	through	me	.
you	could	see	in	the	middle	that	 de 	 vice 	 	,	that	little	structure	,	 squeez 	 ing 	 	out	.
now	that	's	a	left	ventricle	 push 	 ing 	 	blood	up	through	the	aortic	 val 	 ve 	 	--	you	can	see	two	of	the	 leaf 	 lets 	 	of	the	aortic	 val 	 ve 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	there	--	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ascend 	 ing 	 	aorta	.
and	it	's	that	part	,	the	 ascend 	 ing 	 	aorta	,	which	dilates	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 burst 	 s 	 	,	which	,	of	course	,	is	fatal	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	by	 organ 	 izing 	 	image	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	from	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 reson 	 ance 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	and	ct	 im 	 aging 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	from	which	to	make	a	model	of	the	patient	's	aorta	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	model	of	my	aorta	.
i	've	got	a	real	one	in	my	pocket	,	if	 any 	 one 	 	would	like	to	look	at	it	and	play	with	it	.
you	can	see	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	complex	structure	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	funny	trilobal	shape	at	the	bottom	,	which	 contain 	 s 	 	the	aortic	 val 	 ve 	 	.
it	then	 come 	 s 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	a	round	form	and	then	tapers	and	 curv 	 es 	 	off	.
so	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	difficult	structure	to	produce	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	like	i	say	,	is	a	cad	model	of	me	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 lat 	 er 	 	cad	 model 	 s 	 	.
we	went	through	an	 ite 	 rative 	 	process	of	producing	better	and	better	 model 	 s 	 	.
when	we	 produce 	 d 	 	that	model	we	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	solid	plastic	model	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	using	a	rapid	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	.
we	then	use	that	 form 	 er 	 	to	 manufactur 	 e 	 	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 be 	 spoke 	 	 por 	 ous 	 	 text 	 ile 	 	mesh	,	which	 take 	 s 	 	the	shape	of	the	 form 	 er 	 	and	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	the	aorta	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 personal 	 ized 	 	medicine	at	 it 	 s 	 	best	 re 	 ally 	 	.
every	patient	we	do	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 be 	 spoke 	 	implant	.
once	you	've	made	it	,	the	 install 	 ation 	 	's	 quit 	 e 	 	easy	.
john	pepper	,	bless	his	heart	,	professor	of	cardiothoracic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	--	never	 d 	 one 	 	it	before	in	his	life	--	he	put	the	first	one	in	,	did	n't	like	it	,	took	it	out	,	put	the	second	one	in	.
happy	,	away	i	went	.
four	and	a	half	 hour 	 s 	 	on	the	table	and	 every 	 thing 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	.
so	the	 sur 	 gical 	 	 implant 	 ation 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	part	.
if	you	 compar 	 e 	 	our	new	 treat 	 ment 	 	to	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	,	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	composite	aortic	root	graft	,	there	are	one	of	two	 start 	 ling 	 	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	,	which	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	will	be	clear	to	all	of	you	.
two	 hour 	 s 	 	to	install	one	of	our	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	six	 hour 	 s 	 	for	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	heart	and	lung	bypass	machine	and	it	 requir 	 es 	 	a	total	body	 cool 	 ing 	 	.
we	do	n't	need	any	of	that	;	we	work	on	a	 beat 	 ing 	 	heart	.
he	 open 	 s 	 	you	up	,	he	 access 	 es 	 	the	aorta	while	your	heart	is	 beat 	 ing 	 	,	all	at	the	right	temperature	.
no	 break 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	 circul 	 atory 	 	system	.
so	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	great	.
but	for	me	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	the	best	point	is	there	is	no	anticoagulation	therapy	 requir 	 ed 	 	.
i	do	n't	take	any	 drug 	 s 	 	at	all	other	than	 re 	 creation 	 al 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	i	would	 choos 	 e 	 	to	take	.
and	in	fact	,	if	you	speak	to	people	who	are	on	long	-	term	warfarin	,	it	is	a	serious	 com 	 promise 	 	to	your	quality	of	life	.
and	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	it	 inevit 	 ably 	 	foreshortens	your	life	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	if	you	have	the	artificial	 val 	 ve 	 	option	,	you	're	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	 anti 	 biotic 	 	therapy	 when 	 ever 	 	you	have	any	intrusive	medical	 treat 	 ment 	 	at	all	.
even	 trip 	 s 	 	to	the	 dent 	 ist 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	that	you	take	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	,	in	case	you	get	an	internal	 infect 	 ion 	 	on	the	 val 	 ve 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	do	n't	have	any	of	that	,	so	i	'm	 entire 	 ly 	 	free	.
my	aorta	is	 fix 	 ed 	 	,	i	have	n't	got	to	worry	about	it	,	which	is	a	 re 	 birth 	 	for	me	.
back	to	the	theme	of	the	 present 	 ation 	 	:	in	 multi 	 disciplinary 	 	research	,	how	on	earth	 do 	 es 	 	a	process	engineer	used	to	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 boil 	 ers 	 	end	up	producing	a	medical	 de 	 vice 	 	which	 transform 	 s 	 	his	own	life	?
well	the	answer	to	that	is	a	 multi 	 disciplinary 	 	team	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	list	of	the	core	team	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	there	are	not	 on 	 ly 	 	two	principal	technical	 discipline 	 s 	 	there	,	medicine	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	there	are	 vari 	 ous 	 	 special 	 ists 	 	from	 with 	 in 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 discipline 	 s 	 	.
john	pepper	there	was	the	cardiac	surgeon	who	did	the	actual	work	on	me	,	but	 every 	 one 	 	else	there	had	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
raad	mohiaddin	,	medical	 radio 	 logist 	 	:	we	had	to	get	good	quality	 image 	 s 	 	from	which	to	make	the	cad	model	.
warren	thornton	,	who	still	 do 	 es 	 	all	our	cad	 model 	 s 	 	for	us	,	had	to	write	a	 be 	 spoke 	 	piece	of	cad	code	to	produce	 th 	 is 	 	model	from	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	difficult	 in 	 put 	 	data	set	.
there	are	some	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	.	there	are	some	 problem 	 s 	 	with	it	.
 jar 	 gon 	 	is	a	big	one	.
i	would	think	no	one	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 understand 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	four	first	 jar 	 gon 	 	 point 	 s 	 	there	.
the	 engineer 	 s 	 	 among 	 st 	 	you	will	 recogn 	 ize 	 	rapid	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	and	cad	.
the	medics	 among 	 st 	 	you	,	if	there	are	any	,	will	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	first	two	.
but	there	will	be	 no 	 body 	 	else	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	that	 understand 	 s 	 	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	four	 word 	 s 	 	.
taking	the	 jar 	 gon 	 	out	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	ensure	that	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	team	 under 	 stood 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	was	 me 	 ant 	 	when	a	 part 	 icular 	 	phrase	was	used	.
our	disciplinary	 convention 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	funny	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
we	took	a	lot	of	 horizon 	 tal 	 	slice	 image 	 s 	 	through	me	,	 produce 	 d 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 slice 	 s 	 	and	then	used	 t 	 hose 	 	to	build	a	cad	model	.
and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	cad	model	we	made	,	the	 surgeon 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	the	plastic	model	,	could	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	figure	it	out	.
and	then	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	mirror	image	of	the	real	aorta	.
and	it	was	a	mirror	image	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	real	world	we	 al 	 ways 	 	look	down	on	 plan 	 s 	 	,	 plan 	 s 	 	of	 house 	 s 	 	or	 street 	 s 	 	or	 map 	 s 	 	.
in	the	medical	world	they	look	up	at	 plan 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	 image 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	an	 in 	 version 	 	.
so	one	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 care 	 ful 	 	with	disciplinary	 convention 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	understand	what	is	 assum 	 ed 	 	and	what	is	not	 assum 	 ed 	 	.
 institution 	 al 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 an 	 other 	 	serious	 head 	 ache 	 	in	the	project	.
the	brompton	hospital	was	taken	over	by	imperial	college	's	school	of	medicine	,	and	there	are	some	 serious 	 ly 	 	bad	relationship	 problem 	 s 	 	between	the	two	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	imperial	and	the	brompton	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	generated	some	serious	 problem 	 s 	 	with	the	project	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	should	n't	exist	.

and	they	made	extra	 problem 	 s 	 	for	us	.

we	had	to	get	past	the	nice	problem	.
we	now	have	a	great	 clinic 	 al 	 	 gui 	 dance 	 	out	on	the	net	.
