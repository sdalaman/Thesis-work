if	you	ask	people	about	what	part	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	do	they	think	is	hard	,	and	you	say	,	``	well	,	what	about	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	?	``
most	people	will	say	,	``	 emotion 	 s 	 	are	 terr 	 ibly 	 	hard	.
they	're	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	complex	.	they	ca	n't	--	i	have	no	idea	of	how	they	work	.
but	 think 	 ing 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	:	it	's	just	sort	of	some	kind	of	logical	 reason 	 ing 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
but	that	's	not	the	hard	part	.	``
so	here	's	a	list	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	come	up	.
one	nice	problem	is	,	what	do	we	do	about	health	?
the	other	day	,	i	was	 read 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	the	person	 s 	 aid 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	largest	single	cause	of	disease	is	handshaking	in	the	west	.
and	there	was	a	little	 stud 	 y 	 	about	people	who	do	n't	 hand 	 shake 	 	,	and	 compar 	 ing 	 	them	with	 one 	 s 	 	who	do	 hand 	 shake 	 	.
and	i	have	n't	the	 fog 	 g 	 iest 	 	idea	of	where	you	find	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	 hand 	 shake 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	must	be	 hid 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	people	who	avoid	that	have	30	percent	less	 infect 	 ious 	 	disease	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	31	and	a	quarter	percent	.
so	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	solve	the	problem	of	 epi 	 demic 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	,	let	's	start	with	that	.	and	since	i	got	that	idea	,	i	've	had	to	shake	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	avoid	it	is	to	have	some	 horr 	 ible 	 	visible	disease	,	and	then	you	do	n't	have	to	explain	.
education	:	how	do	we	improve	education	?
well	,	the	single	best	way	is	to	get	them	to	understand	that	what	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	told	is	a	whole	lot	of	 non 	 sense 	 	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	you	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	how	to	moderate	that	,	so	that	 any 	 body 	 	can	--	so	they	'll	listen	to	you	.
 poll 	 ution 	 	,	energy	 short 	 age 	 	,	 environment 	 al 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	poverty	.
how	do	we	make	 s 	 table 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	?	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	there	're	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	to	worry	about	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	the	question	i	think	people	should	talk	about	--	and	it	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	taboo	--	is	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	should	there	be	?
and	i	think	it	should	be	about	100	million	or	 may 	 be 	 	500	million	.
and	then	notice	that	a	great	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 problem 	 s 	 	disappear	.
if	you	had	100	million	people	 proper 	 ly 	 	spread	out	,	then	if	there	's	some	garbage	,	you	throw	it	away	,	 prefer 	 ably 	 	where	you	ca	n't	see	it	,	and	it	will	rot	.
or	you	throw	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	and	some	fish	will	benefit	from	it	.
the	problem	is	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	should	there	be	?
and	it	's	a	sort	of	choice	we	have	to	make	.
most	people	are	about	60	 inch 	 es 	 	high	or	more	,	and	there	's	these	cube	 law 	 s 	 	.	so	if	you	make	them	 th 	 is 	 	big	,	by	using	 nano 	 technology 	 	,	i	suppose	--	--	then	you	could	have	a	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	.
that	would	solve	the	problem	,	but	i	do	n't	see	 any 	 body 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	any	research	on	making	people	 small 	 er 	 	.
now	,	it	's	nice	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	population	,	but	a	lot	of	people	want	to	have	children	.
and	there	's	one	solution	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	off	.
you	know	you	have	46	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.	if	you	're	 luck 	 y 	 	,	you	've	got	23	from	each	parent	.	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	get	an	extra	one	or	drop	one	out	,	but	--	so	you	can	skip	the	 grand 	 parent 	 	and	great	-	 grand 	 parent 	 	stage	and	go	right	to	the	great	-	great	-	 grand 	 parent 	 	.	and	you	have	46	people	and	you	give	them	a	scanner	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	you	need	,	and	they	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 chromosom 	 es 	 	and	each	of	them	 say 	 s 	 	which	one	he	 like 	 s 	 	best	,	or	she	--	no	reason	to	have	just	two	 s 	 ex 	 es 	 	any	more	,	even	.	so	each	child	 ha 	 s 	 	46	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	i	suppose	you	could	let	each	group	of	46	 parent 	 s 	 	have	15	children	.
would	n't	that	be	 en 	 ough 	 	?	and	then	the	children	would	get	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	support	,	and	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	,	and	 mentor 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	world	population	would	decline	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	and	 every 	 body 	 	would	be	 total 	 ly 	 	happy	.
 time 	 sharing 	 	is	a	little	further	off	in	the	future	.
and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	great	novel	that	arthur	clarke	wrote	twice	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	against	the	fall	of	night	``	and	``	the	city	and	the	 star 	 s 	 	.	``
they	're	both	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	 large 	 ly 	 	the	same	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	 computer 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	between	.
and	arthur	was	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	old	book	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	that	was	wrong	.
the	future	must	have	some	 computer 	 s 	 	.	``
so	in	the	second	version	of	it	,	there	are	100	billion	or	1,000	billion	people	on	earth	,	but	they	're	all	 store 	 d 	 	on	hard	 dis 	 k 	 s 	 	or	floppies	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	they	have	in	the	future	.
and	you	let	a	few	million	of	them	out	at	a	time	.
a	person	 come 	 s 	 	out	,	they	live	for	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	they	do	,	and	then	,	when	it	's	time	to	go	back	for	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	--	or	a	million	,	i	forget	,	the	 number 	 s 	 	do	n't	matter	--	but	there	 re 	 ally 	 	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	on	earth	at	a	time	.
and	you	get	to	think	about	 your 	 self 	 	and	your	 memor 	 ies 	 	,	and	before	you	go	back	 in 	 to 	 	 s 	 us 	 pension 	 	,	you	edit	your	 memor 	 ies 	 	and	you	change	your	 personal 	 ity 	 	and	so	forth	.
the	plot	of	the	book	is	that	there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	so	that	the	people	who	designed	the	city	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	every	now	and	then	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	person	is	 create 	 d 	 	.
and	in	the	novel	,	a	 part 	 icular 	 	one	named	alvin	is	 create 	 d 	 	.	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	the	best	way	,	and	 wreck 	 s 	 	the	whole	system	.
i	do	n't	think	the	 solution 	 s 	 	that	i	 pro 	 posed 	 	are	good	 en 	 ough 	 	or	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	.
i	think	the	big	problem	is	that	we	're	not	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	to	understand	which	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	we	're	facing	are	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	,	we	have	to	build	super	intelligent	 machine 	 s 	 	like	hal	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	remember	,	at	some	point	in	the	book	for	``	2001	,	``	hal	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	too	big	,	and	grand	,	and	 pro 	 found 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	stupid	 astro 	 nauts 	 	.	if	you	contrast	hal	's	behavior	with	the	 trivial 	 ity 	 	of	the	people	on	the	 space 	 ship 	 	,	you	can	see	what	's	written	between	the	lines	.
well	,	what	are	we	going	to	do	about	that	?	we	could	get	 smart 	 er 	 	.
i	think	that	we	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	smart	,	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	but	we	're	not	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	to	deal	with	the	colossal	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	face	,	either	in	abstract	 mathematic 	 s 	 	or	in	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	or	 balanc 	 ing 	 	the	world	around	.
so	one	thing	we	can	do	is	live	 long 	 er 	 	.
and	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	how	hard	that	is	,	but	we	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	find	out	in	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
you	see	,	there	's	two	 for 	 k 	 s 	 	in	the	road	.	we	know	that	people	live	twice	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	 live 	 s 	 	more	than	120	 year 	 s 	 	,	for	 reason 	 s 	 	that	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 under 	 stood 	 	.
but	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	now	live	to	90	or	100	,	 un 	 less 	 	they	shake	 hand 	 s 	 	too	much	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
and	so	 may 	 be 	 	if	we	lived	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	could	 accumul 	 ate 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	and	knowledge	to	solve	some	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	one	way	of	going	about	it	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	do	n't	know	how	hard	that	is	.	it	might	be	--	after	all	,	most	other	 mammal 	 s 	 	live	half	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	the	chimpanzee	,	so	we	're	sort	of	three	and	a	half	or	four	 time 	 s 	 	,	have	four	 time 	 s 	 	the	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	of	most	 mammal 	 s 	 	.	and	in	the	case	of	the	 prim 	 ates 	 	,	we	have	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	 gene 	 s 	 	.	we	 on 	 ly 	 	differ	from	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	in	the	present	state	of	knowledge	,	which	is	absolute	 hog 	 wash 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	by	just	a	few	hundred	 gene 	 s 	 	.
what	i	think	is	that	the	gene	 counter 	 s 	 	do	n't	know	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	yet	.
and	 what 	 ever 	 	you	do	,	do	n't	read	 any 	 thing 	 	about	 genetic 	 s 	 	that	's	 publish 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	your	 life 	 time 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
the	stuff	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	half	-	life	,	same	with	brain	science	.
and	so	it	might	be	that	if	we	just	fix	four	or	five	 gene 	 s 	 	,	we	can	live	200	 year 	 s 	 	.
or	it	might	be	that	it	's	just	30	or	40	,	and	i	doubt	that	it	's	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	people	will	be	 discuss 	 ing 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 ethic 	 ists 	 	--	you	know	,	an	ethicist	is	 some 	 body 	 	who	 s 	 ees 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	 what 	 ever 	 	you	have	in	mind	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	find	an	ethicist	who	 consider 	 s 	 	any	change	worth	making	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	what	about	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	?
and	,	of	course	,	we	're	not	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	now	,	are	we	?	like	all	 th 	 is 	 	 complain 	 t 	 	about	 clone 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	two	random	people	will	mate	and	have	 th 	 is 	 	child	,	and	both	of	them	have	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 rot 	 ten 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	,	and	the	child	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	come	out	to	be	average	.
which	,	by	chimpanzee	 standard 	 s 	 	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
if	we	do	have	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	,	then	we	'll	have	to	face	the	population	growth	problem	 any 	 way 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	if	people	live	200	or	1,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	then	we	ca	n't	let	them	have	a	child	more	than	about	once	every	200	or	1,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	so	there	wo	n't	be	any	 work 	 force 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	laurie	garrett	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	and	 other 	 s 	 	have	,	is	that	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	people	of	 work 	 ing 	 	age	is	in	real	trouble	.	and	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	to	get	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 no 	 body 	 	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	the	children	or	to	feed	the	old	.
and	when	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	long	 life 	 time 	 	,	of	course	,	i	do	n't	want	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	200	 year 	 s 	 	old	to	be	like	our	image	of	what	a	200	-	year	-	old	is	--	which	is	dead	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
you	know	,	there	's	about	400	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	which	seem	to	have	different	 function 	 s 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	how	most	of	them	work	in	detail	,	but	we	do	know	that	there	're	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	in	there	.
and	they	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	work	together	.	i	like	freud	's	 theor 	 y 	 	that	most	of	them	are	cancelling	each	other	out	.
and	so	if	you	think	of	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	city	with	a	hundred	 resource 	 s 	 	,	then	,	when	you	're	 af 	 raid 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	may	 dis 	 card 	 	your	long	-	range	 goal 	 s 	 	,	but	you	may	think	 deep 	 ly 	 	and	focus	on	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	 part 	 icular 	 	goal	.
you	throw	 every 	 thing 	 	else	away	.	you	 be 	 come 	 	a	monomaniac	--	all	you	care	about	is	not	 step 	 ping 	 	out	on	that	platform	.
and	when	you	're	 hung 	 ry 	 	,	food	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	 attract 	 ive 	 	,	and	so	forth	.
so	i	see	 emotion 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 sub 	 set 	 s 	 	of	your	 cap 	 ability 	 	.
emotion	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	to	thought	.	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	state	is	what	you	get	when	you	 re 	 move 	 	100	or	200	of	your	 normal 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	.
so	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	--	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	less	than	 think 	 ing 	 	is	 immense 	 ly 	 	productive	.	and	i	hope	,	in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	to	show	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	lead	to	smart	 machine 	 s 	 	.
and	i	guess	i	better	skip	all	the	rest	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	are	some	 detail 	 s 	 	on	how	we	might	make	 t 	 hose 	 	smart	 machine 	 s 	 	and	--	--	and	the	main	idea	is	in	fact	that	the	core	of	a	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	machine	is	one	that	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	a	certain	kind	of	problem	is	facing	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	of	 s 	 uch 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	a	type	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	there	's	a	certain	way	or	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	that	are	good	for	that	problem	.
so	i	think	the	future	,	main	problem	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	is	to	 class 	 ify 	 	 type 	 s 	 	of	predicaments	,	 type 	 s 	 	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	 type 	 s 	 	of	 obstacle 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	 class 	 ify 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	and	possible	ways	to	think	and	pair	them	up	.
so	you	see	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	pavlovian	--	we	lost	the	first	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	by	 re 	 ally 	 	trivial	 the 	 ories 	 	,	where	you	say	,	how	do	people	learn	how	to	react	to	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	?	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	is	,	after	we	go	through	a	lot	of	 level 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	a	huge	,	 mess 	 y 	 	system	with	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 port 	 s 	 	,	we	'll	end	up	 aga 	 in 	 	with	the	central	problem	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	.
 say 	 ing 	 	,	not	what	are	the	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	but	what	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	and	what	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	,	how	do	you	learn	them	,	how	do	you	connect	them	up	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	creative	person	invent	a	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	out	of	the	 avail 	 able 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
so	,	i	think	in	the	next	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	if	we	can	get	rid	of	all	of	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 approach 	 es 	 	to	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	like	neural	 net 	 s 	 	and	genetic	 algorithm 	 s 	 	and	rule	-	based	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	just	turn	our	 sight 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	 high 	 er 	 	to	say	,	can	we	make	a	system	that	can	use	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	the	right	kind	of	problem	?	some	 problem 	 s 	 	are	good	for	neural	 net 	 s 	 	;	we	know	that	 other 	 s 	 	,	neural	 net 	 s 	 	are	 hope 	 less 	 	on	them	.
genetic	 algorithm 	 s 	 	are	great	for	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	;	i	suspect	i	know	what	they	're	bad	at	,	and	i	wo	n't	tell	you	.
thank	you	.
