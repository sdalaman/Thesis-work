for	a	moment	,	what	i	need	to	do	is	project	 some 	 thing 	 	on	the	screen	of	your	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
we	're	in	17th	century	japan	on	the	west	coast	,	and	a	little	,	 wiz 	 ened 	 	monk	is	 hur 	 ry 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	near	 mid 	 night 	 	,	to	the	crest	of	a	small	hill	.
he	 arriv 	 es 	 	on	the	small	hill	,	 drip 	 ping 	 	with	water	.
he	 stand 	 s 	 	there	,	and	he	 look 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	at	the	 is 	 land 	 	,	sado	.
and	he	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	,	and	he	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	sky	.
then	he	 say 	 s 	 	to	 him 	 self 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quiet 	 ly 	 	,	``	[	 turbul 	 ent 	 	the	sea	,	]	[	 stretch 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	to	sado	]	[	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	]	.	``
basho	was	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	man	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	more	with	less	than	any	human	that	i	have	ever	read	or	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	.
basho	,	in	17	 syllable 	 s 	 	,	 juxta 	 posed 	 	a	 turbul 	 ent 	 	ocean	driven	by	a	storm	now	past	,	and	 capture 	 d 	 	the	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	our	home	 galax 	 y 	 	with	 million 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	--	who	 know 	 s 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	--	 planet 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	an	ocean	that	we	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	call	sylvia	in	time	.
 a 	 s 	 	he	was	 near 	 ing 	 	his	death	,	his	 discip 	 les 	 	and	 follow 	 ers 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	him	,	``	what	's	the	secret	?
how	can	you	make	haiku	 poem 	 s 	 	so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	so	 eas 	 ily 	 	?	``
and	 to 	 ward 	 	the	end	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	would	know	the	pine	tree	,	go	to	the	pine	tree	.	``
that	was	it	.
sylvia	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	we	must	use	every	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	we	have	in	order	to	know	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
if	we	would	know	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	we	must	go	to	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	,	a	little	bit	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	relationship	,	or	the	 inter 	 play 	 	,	between	 human 	 s 	 	and	 ocean 	 s 	 	with	a	new	 cap 	 ability 	 	that	is	not	at	all	routine	yet	.
i	hope	it	will	be	.
there	are	a	few	key	 point 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	is	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	are	central	to	the	quality	of	life	on	earth	.
 an 	 other 	 	is	that	there	are	bold	,	new	ways	of	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 ocean 	 s 	 	that	we	have	not	used	well	yet	.
and	the	last	is	that	these	bold	,	new	ways	that	we	are	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	will	transform	the	way	we	look	at	our	planet	,	our	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	how	we	manage	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	entire	planet	,	for	what	it	's	worth	.
so	what	 scientist 	 s 	 	do	when	they	begin	is	to	start	with	the	system	.
they	define	what	the	system	is	.
the	system	is	n't	chesapeake	 ba 	 y 	 	.
it	's	not	the	kuril	arc	.	it	's	not	even	the	entire	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
it	's	the	whole	planet	,	the	entire	planet	,	 continent 	 s 	 	and	 ocean 	 s 	 	together	.
that	's	the	system	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	our	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	to	optimize	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	and	 mitig 	 ate 	 	the	 risk 	 s 	 	of	living	on	a	planet	that	's	driven	by	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 process 	 es 	 	,	two	 source 	 s 	 	of	energy	,	one	of	which	is	solar	,	that	 drive 	 s 	 	the	 wind 	 s 	 	,	the	 wave 	 s 	 	,	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	the	 storm 	 s 	 	and	 photo 	 synthesis 	 	.
the	second	one	is	internal	energy	.
and	these	two	war	against	one	 an 	 other 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 continu 	 ously 	 	.
mountain	 range 	 s 	 	,	plate	 tectonic 	 s 	 	,	 move 	 s 	 	the	 continent 	 s 	 	around	,	 form 	 s 	 	ore	 deposit 	 s 	 	.
 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	erupt	.
that	's	the	planet	that	we	live	on	.
it	's	 immense 	 ly 	 	complex	.
now	i	do	n't	expect	all	of	you	to	see	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	here	,	but	what	i	want	you	to	see	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	10	percent	of	the	 process 	 es 	 	that	 oper 	 ate 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 continu 	 ously 	 	,	and	have	for	the	last	4	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	system	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
and	these	have	all	co	-	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
what	do	i	mean	by	that	?
they	interact	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	.
all	of	them	interact	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	that	we	're	looking	at	,	the	one	driven	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	--	upper	 port 	 ion 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	--	and	the	lower	 port 	 ion 	 	is	 part 	 ly 	 	driven	by	the	 in 	 put 	 	from	heat	 be 	 low 	 	and	by	other	 process 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	system	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 cruci 	 ble 	 	,	out	of	which	life	on	the	planet	came	,	and	it	's	now	time	for	us	to	understand	it	.
we	must	understand	it	.
that	's	one	of	the	 theme 	 s 	 	that	sylvia	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	us	about	:	understand	 th 	 is 	 	ocean	of	 our 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	life	support	system	,	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	life	support	system	on	the	planet	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 vari 	 able 	 	.
if	you	can	see	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	you	can	see	how	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	 ed 	 dies 	 	and	large	 ed 	 dies 	 	and	the	motion	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	sea	surface	temperature	,	but	it	's	 immense 	 ly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
now	a	layer	in	,	the	other	two	or	three	hundred	 process 	 es 	 	that	are	all	 interact 	 ing 	 	,	 part 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	temperature	,	 part 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	all	the	other	 factor 	 s 	 	,	and	you	've	got	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	system	.
that	's	our	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	is	to	understand	,	understand	 th 	 is 	 	system	in	new	and	 phenomen 	 al 	 	ways	.
and	there	's	an	 urge 	 ncy 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
part	of	the	 urge 	 ncy 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	fact	that	,	of	order	,	a	billion	people	on	the	planet	 current 	 ly 	 	are	 under 	 nourish 	 ed 	 	or	 starv 	 ing 	 	.
and	part	of	the	issue	is	for	cody	--	who	's	here	,	16	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	and	i	have	 per 	 mission 	 	to	 re 	 lay 	 	 th 	 is 	 	number	.
when	he	,	40	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	is	the	age	of	nancy	 brow 	 n 	 	,	there	are	going	to	be	 an 	 other 	 	two	and	a	half	billion	people	on	the	planet	.
we	ca	n't	solve	all	the	 problem 	 s 	 	by	looking	 on 	 ly 	 	at	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	but	if	we	do	n't	understand	the	fundamental	life	support	system	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	much	more	 thorough 	 ly 	 	than	we	do	now	,	then	the	 stress 	 es 	 	that	we	will	face	,	and	that	cody	will	face	,	and	even	nancy	,	who	's	going	to	live	till	she	's	98	,	will	have	 re 	 ally 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	 cop 	 ing 	 	.
all	right	,	let	's	talk	about	 an 	 other 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	which	is	 show 	 ing 	 	warm	 water 	 s 	 	in	red	,	cool	 water 	 s 	 	in	blue	,	and	on	the	 continent 	 s 	 	,	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	in	bright	green	,	is	the	growth	of	 veget 	 ation 	 	,	and	in	 o 	 live 	 	green	,	the	 die 	 back 	 	of	 veget 	 ation 	 	.
and	in	the	lower	left	hand	corner	there	's	a	clock	 tick 	 ing 	 	away	from	1982	to	1998	and	then	 cycl 	 ing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
what	you	'll	see	is	that	the	 rhythm 	 s 	 	of	growth	,	of	 veget 	 ation 	 	--	a	 sub 	 set 	 	of	which	is	food	on	the	 continent 	 s 	 	--	is	 direct 	 ly 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	the	 rhythm 	 s 	 	of	the	sea	surface	 temperature 	 s 	 	.
the	 ocean 	 s 	 	control	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	influence	,	correlate	with	,	the	growth	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	the	drought	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	the	rain	 pattern 	 s 	 	on	the	 continent 	 s 	 	.
so	people	in	kansas	,	in	a	wheat	field	in	kansas	,	need	to	understand	that	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	are	central	to	them	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 an 	 other 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	age	of	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	layer	in	on	top	of	 th 	 is 	 	the	tectonic	 plate 	 s 	 	.
the	age	of	the	ocean	,	the	tectonic	 plate 	 s 	 	,	 give 	 s 	 	rise	to	a	 total 	 ly 	 	new	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	we	have	heard	about	in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	.
and	i	share	with	you	some	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	definition	video	that	we	 collect 	 ed 	 	in	real	time	.
 second 	 s 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	video	was	taken	,	people	in	beijing	,	people	in	sydney	,	people	in	amsterdam	,	people	in	washington	d.c.	 we 	 re 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	you	've	heard	of	 hydro 	 thermal 	 	 vent 	 s 	 	,	but	the	other	 discover 	 y 	 	is	that	deep	 be 	 low 	 	the	sea	floor	,	there	is	vast	reservoir	of	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	activity	,	which	we	have	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 discover 	 ed 	 	and	we	have	 al 	 most 	 	no	way	to	 stud 	 y 	 	.
some	people	have	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	the	 bio 	 mass 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	up	in	these	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	living	in	the	 pour 	 s 	 	and	the	 crack 	 s 	 	of	the	sea	floor	and	 be 	 low 	 	rival	the	total	amount	of	living	 bio 	 mass 	 	at	the	surface	of	the	planet	.
it	's	an	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	,	and	we	have	 on 	 ly 	 	found	out	about	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
it	may	be	the	next	 rain 	 forest 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	.
we	know	little	or	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
well	,	marcel	proust	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	``	the	real	voyage	of	 discover 	 y 	 	 consist 	 s 	 	not	so	much	in	seeking	new	 territ 	 ory 	 	,	but	possibly	in	 hav 	 ing 	 	new	 set 	 s 	 	of	 eye 	 s 	 	,	``	new	ways	of	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	a	new	 mind 	 set 	 	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	remember	the	early	 stage 	 s 	 	of	 ocean 	 ography 	 	,	when	we	had	to	use	what	we	had	at	our	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	n't	easy	.	it	was	n't	easy	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.
some	of	you	remember	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	.
and	now	,	we	have	an	entire	 suit 	 e 	 	of	 tool 	 s 	 	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	--	 ship 	 s 	 	,	 satellite 	 s 	 	,	 moor 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
but	they	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	cut	it	.	they	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	give	us	what	we	need	.
and	the	program	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	talk	to	you	about	just	a	little	bit	here	,	was	funded	,	and	it	 involve 	 s 	 	autonomous	 vehicle 	 s 	 	like	the	one	running	 a 	 cross 	 	the	base	of	 th 	 is 	 	image	.
 model 	 ing 	 	:	on	the	right	hand	side	,	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	 computation 	 al 	 	model	.
on	the	left	hand	side	,	there	's	a	new	type	of	 moor 	 ing 	 	,	which	i	'll	show	you	in	just	a	second	.
and	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 point 	 s 	 	,	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	are	complex	,	and	they	're	central	to	the	life	on	earth	.
they	are	changing	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	but	not	 predict 	 ably 	 	.
and	the	 model 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	predict	the	future	do	not	have	 en 	 ough 	 	data	to	refine	them	.
the	 computation 	 al 	 	power	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
but	 with 	 out 	 	data	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 model 	 s 	 	will	never	ever	be	 predict 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	.
for	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	they	're	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	but	we	feel	that	ooi	,	 th 	 is 	 	ocean	 observ 	 atory 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	which	the	national	science	 found 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	to	fund	,	 ha 	 s 	 	the	potential	to	 re 	 ally 	 	transform	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	the	goal	of	the	program	is	to	launch	an	era	of	scientific	 discover 	 y 	 	and	 understand 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	and	 with 	 in 	 	the	ocean	 basin 	 s 	 	,	 util 	 izing 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	,	 inter 	 active 	 	 tele 	 presence 	 	.
it	's	a	new	world	.
we	will	be	present	 through 	 out 	 	the	volume	of	the	ocean	,	at	will	,	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	in	real	time	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	system	 involve 	 s 	 	,	a	number	of	 s 	 ites 	 	in	the	southern	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	 show 	 n 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	there	are	four	 s 	 ites 	 	.
i	wo	n't	talk	a	lot	about	most	of	them	right	here	,	but	the	one	on	the	west	coast	,	that	's	in	the	box	,	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 region 	 al 	 	scale	 nod 	 es 	 	.
it	was	once	 call 	 ed 	 	neptune	.
and	let	me	show	you	what	's	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.

you	can	see	the	 cop 	 per 	 	 tip 	 s 	 	on	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	can	transmit	power	,	but	the	 band 	 width 	 	is	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	hair	on	your	head	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	set	here	can	transmit	 some 	 thing 	 	of	the	order	of	three	to	five	 tera 	 bits 	 	per	second	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 phenomen 	 al 	 	 band 	 width 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	planet	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
we	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 lace 	 d 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	're	in	a	fiber	optic	 cor 	 set 	 	,	if	you	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
and	the	 cable 	 s 	 	go	 re 	 ally 	 	continent	to	continent	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	system	,	and	most	of	our	 communication 	 s 	 	consist	of	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	system	that	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	off	the	west	coast	.	it	's	 co 	 incident 	 	with	the	tectonic	plate	,	the	juan	de	fuca	tectonic	plate	.
and	it	's	going	to	deliver	abundant	power	and	unprecedented	 band 	 width 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	entire	volume	--	in	the	 over 	 ly 	 ing 	 	ocean	,	on	the	sea	floor	and	 be 	 low 	 	the	sea	floor	.
 band 	 width 	 	and	power	and	a	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 process 	 es 	 	that	will	be	 oper 	 ating 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	 nod 	 es 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	and	it	's	like	a	sub	station	with	power	and	 band 	 width 	 	that	can	spread	out	over	an	area	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	seattle	.
and	the	kind	of	science	that	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	will	be	 determine 	 d 	 	by	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	want	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	and	can	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 instrument 	 ation 	 	to	the	table	.
they	will	 br 	 ing 	 	it	and	link	it	in	.
it	'll	be	,	in	a	sense	,	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	time	on	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	you	'll	have	your	own	port	.

so	 any 	 one 	 	coming	 a 	 long 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 access 	 es 	 	the	 data 	 base 	 	and	can	draw	down	the	information	they	need	about	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	place	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	first	of	these	.
in	 con 	 junction 	 	with	our	canadian	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	we	've	set	 th 	 is 	 	up	.

on	the	left	hand	side	there	is	a	large	 volcan 	 o 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	axial	 sea 	 mount 	 	.
and	we	're	going	to	go	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	axial	 sea 	 mount 	 	using	 anim 	 ation 	 	.
here	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	system	is	going	to	look	like	that	we	are	funded	to	build	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.

that	's	an	 elev 	 ator 	 	that	's	 constant 	 ly 	 	moving	up	and	down	,	but	it	can	be	controlled	by	the	 folk 	 s 	 	on	land	who	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	it	.
or	they	can	transfer	control	to	 some 	 one 	 	in	india	or	 chin 	 a 	 	who	can	take	over	for	a	while	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	all	going	to	be	 direct 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	through	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	much	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	single	ship	in	a	single	location	,	then	move	to	a	new	location	.
we	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	caldera	floor	.
there	is	a	number	of	robotic	 system 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 camera 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	and	off	at	your	will	,	if	 t 	 hose 	 	are	your	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 system 	 s 	 	that	will	be	down	there	,	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 instrument 	 s 	 	that	will	be	on	the	sea	floor	,	consist	of	--	if	you	can	read	them	there	--	there	's	 camera 	 s 	 	,	there	's	pressure	 sensor 	 s 	 	,	 fluo 	 rometers 	 	,	there	's	 seismo 	 meter 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	full	spectrum	of	 tool 	 s 	 	.
now	,	that	mound	right	there	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	activity	that	we	can	see	with	high	-	definition	video	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 band 	 width 	 	of	these	 cable 	 s 	 	is	so	huge	that	we	could	have	five	to	10	stereo	hd	 system 	 s 	 	running	 continu 	 ously 	 	and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 direct 	 ed 	 	through	robotic	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	from	land	.
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
and	these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	funded	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	what	can	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	?
we	're	about	to	ride	the	wave	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
there	are	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	field	around	 ocean 	 ography 	 	,	which	we	will	 in 	 corporate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 ocean 	 ography 	 	,	and	through	that	 converg 	 ence 	 	,	we	will	transform	 ocean 	 ography 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	even	more	 magic 	 al 	 	.
 robotic 	 s 	 	 system 	 s 	 	are	just	 in 	 credible 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
and	we	will	be	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 robotic 	 s 	 	of	all	 sort 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	.
 nano 	 technology 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	small	 gene 	 rator 	 	.
it	's	 small 	 er 	 	than	a	 post 	 age 	 	stamp	,	and	it	can	generate	power	just	by	 be 	 ing 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	your	shirt	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	,	it	 generate 	 s 	 	power	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	be	used	in	the	ocean	,	 continu 	 ously 	 	.
 im 	 aging 	 	:	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	a	good	deal	more	about	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	thing	than	i	,	but	stereo	 im 	 aging 	 	at	four	 time 	 s 	 	the	definition	that	we	have	in	hd	will	be	routine	 with 	 in 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	magic	one	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	the	human	genome	process	,	we	are	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	 event 	 s 	 	that	take	place	in	the	ocean	--	like	an	 erupt 	 ing 	 	 volcan 	 o 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	of	that	sort	--	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 s 	 ampl 	 ed 	 	.
we	pump	the	fluid	through	one	of	these	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	we	press	the	button	,	and	it	's	 analyz 	 ed 	 	for	the	genomic	character	.
and	that	's	 transmit 	 ted 	 	back	to	land	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
so	in	the	volume	of	the	ocean	,	we	will	know	,	not	just	the	physics	and	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	but	the	base	of	the	food	chain	will	be	 trans 	 parent 	 	to	us	with	data	on	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
grid	computing	:	the	power	of	grid	 computer 	 s 	 	is	going	to	be	just	 amaz 	 ing 	 	here	.
we	will	soon	be	using	grid	computing	to	do	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 thing 	 	,	like	adjust	the	data	and	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	with	the	data	.
the	power	generation	will	come	from	the	ocean	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	the	next	generation	fiber	will	be	 simpl 	 y 	 	magic	.
it	's	far	beyond	what	we	 current 	 ly 	 	have	.
so	the	presence	of	the	power	and	the	 band 	 width 	 	in	the	environment	will	allow	all	of	these	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	 converg 	 e 	 	in	a	manner	that	is	just	unprecedented	.
so	 with 	 in 	 	five	to	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	see	us	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	present	 through 	 out 	 	the	ocean	and	have	all	of	that	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	so	we	can	reach	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 folk 	 s 	 	.
 deliver 	 ing 	 	the	power	and	the	 band 	 width 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	will	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 accele 	 rate 	 	 adapt 	 ation 	 	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
when	 earth 	 quake 	 s 	 	take	place	,	massive	 amount 	 s 	 	of	these	new	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	we	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	come	out	of	the	sea	floor	.
we	have	a	way	of	 address 	 ing 	 	that	,	a	new	way	of	 address 	 ing 	 	that	.
we	've	 determine 	 d 	 	from	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	activity	that	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	that	the	top	of	that	 volcan 	 o 	 	is	 erupt 	 ing 	 	,	so	we	deploy	the	 troop 	 s 	 	.
what	are	the	 troop 	 s 	 	?	the	 troop 	 s 	 	are	the	autonomous	 vehicle 	 s 	 	,	of	course	.
and	they	fly	 in 	 to 	 	the	 erupt 	 ing 	 	 volcan 	 o 	 	.
they	 s 	 ample 	 	the	 fluid 	 s 	 	coming	out	of	the	sea	floor	 dur 	 ing 	 	an	 erupt 	 ion 	 	,	which	have	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	to	the	surface	of	the	planet	before	.
they	eject	it	to	the	surface	where	it	 float 	 s 	 	,	and	it	is	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	by	an	autonomous	 air 	 plane 	 	,	and	it	's	 br 	 ought 	 	back	to	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	 with 	 in 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	of	the	 erupt 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 do 	 able 	 	.	all	the	 piece 	 s 	 	are	there	.
a	 labor 	 atory 	 	:	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	heard	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	9/7	.
some	 doctor 	 s 	 	in	new	york	city	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	the	 gall 	 bladder 	 	of	a	woman	in	france	.
we	could	do	work	on	the	sea	floor	that	would	be	 stunn 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	would	be	on	live	tv	,	if	we	have	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	show	.
so	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	 tele 	 presence 	 	to	the	world	,	 through 	 out 	 	the	ocean	.
 th 	 is 	 	--	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	sea	floor	--	but	so	the	goal	here	is	real	time	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	from	 any 	 where 	 	on	earth	.
it	's	going	to	be	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	go	here	,	i	just	want	to	show	you	what	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 class 	 rooms 	 	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	what	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	pocket	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	do	n't	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	yet	,	but	the	ocean	will	be	in	your	pocket	.
it	wo	n't	be	long	.	it	wo	n't	be	long	.
so	let	me	 leav 	 e 	 	you	then	with	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	from	 an 	 other 	 	poet	,	if	you	'll	forgive	me	.
