i	have	18	 minute 	 s 	 	to	tell	you	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	over	the	past	six	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
all	right	.
we	all	have	come	from	a	long	way	,	here	in	africa	,	and	 converg 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	region	of	africa	,	which	is	a	place	where	90	percent	of	our	 evolution 	 ary 	 	process	took	place	.
and	i	say	that	not	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	african	,	but	it	's	in	africa	that	you	find	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	evidence	for	human	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	 up 	 right 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 trace 	 s 	 	,	even	the	first	 techno 	 logies 	 	in	the	form	of	stone	 tool 	 s 	 	.
so	we	all	are	africans	,	and	welcome	home	.
all	right	.
i	'm	a	 paleo 	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	,	and	my	job	is	to	define	man	's	place	in	nature	and	explore	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	human	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	will	use	selam	,	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	child	ever	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	to	tell	you	a	story	of	all	of	us	.
selam	is	our	most	complete	skeleton	of	a	three	-	year	-	old	girl	who	lived	and	 di 	 ed 	 	3.3	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
she	 belong 	 s 	 	to	the	species	known	 a 	 s 	 	australopithecus	afarensis	.
you	do	n't	need	to	remember	that	.
that	's	the	lucy	species	,	and	was	found	by	my	research	team	in	december	of	2000	in	an	area	 call 	 ed 	 	dikika	.
it	's	in	the	 north 	 eastern 	 	part	of	ethiopia	.
and	selam	 mean 	 s 	 	peace	in	 man 	 y 	 	ethiopian	 language 	 s 	 	.
we	use	that	name	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	peace	in	the	region	and	in	the	planet	.
and	the	fact	that	it	was	the	cover	story	of	all	these	famous	 magazine 	 s 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	 al 	 ready 	 	an	idea	of	her	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	,	i	think	.
after	i	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	by	ted	,	i	did	some	 dig 	 ging 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	we	do	,	to	know	about	my	host	.
you	do	n't	just	jump	 in 	 to 	 	an	 invit 	 ation 	 	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	the	first	technology	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	the	form	of	stone	 tool 	 s 	 	,	2.6	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
first	 entertain 	 ment 	 	 come 	 s 	 	evidence	from	 flut 	 es 	 	that	are	35,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	evidence	for	first	design	 come 	 s 	 	75,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	 be 	 ad 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	do	the	same	with	your	 gene 	 s 	 	and	track	them	back	in	time	.
and	then	,	the	analysis	of	living	 human 	 s 	 	and	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	 teach 	 es 	 	us	 to 	 day 	 	that	we	 diverge 	 d 	 	 some 	 time 	 	around	seven	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	that	these	two	species	share	over	98	percent	of	the	same	genetic	material	.
i	think	 know 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 con 	 text 	 	 with 	 in 	 	which	we	can	think	of	our	 ance 	 stry 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	then	the	analysis	 inform 	 s 	 	us	 on 	 ly 	 	about	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	and	the	end	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	middle	.
so	,	for	us	,	 paleo 	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	,	our	job	is	to	find	the	hard	evidence	,	the	fossil	evidence	,	to	fill	in	 th 	 is 	 	gap	and	see	the	different	 stage 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	when	you	do	that	,	that	you	can	talk	about	--	--	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	when	you	do	that	,	[	that	]	you	can	talk	about	how	we	 look 	 ed 	 	like	and	how	we	 behav 	 ed 	 	at	different	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 like 	 s 	 	and	 look 	 s 	 	and	 behavior 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	through	time	.
that	then	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	access	to	explore	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	and	 force 	 s 	 	that	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 gradu 	 al 	 	change	that	made	us	what	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	 find 	 ing 	 	the	hard	evidence	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	endeavor	.
it	's	a	 system 	 atic 	 	and	scientific	approach	,	which	 take 	 s 	 	you	to	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	remote	,	hot	,	 hostil 	 e 	 	and	often	with	no	access	.
just	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	i	went	to	dikika	,	where	selam	was	found	,	in	'99	--	and	it	's	about	500	 kilometer 	 s 	 	from	addis	ababa	,	the	capital	of	ethiopia	.
it	took	us	 on 	 ly 	 	seven	 hour 	 s 	 	to	do	the	first	470	 kilometer 	 s 	 	of	the	500	,	but	took	four	,	solid	 hour 	 s 	 	to	do	the	last	 on 	 ly 	 	30	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
with	the	help	of	the	 local 	 s 	 	and	using	just	 shove 	 l 	 s 	 	and	 pick 	 s 	 	,	i	made	my	way	.
i	was	the	first	person	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	drive	a	car	to	the	spot	.
when	you	get	there	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	see	,	and	it	's	the	 vast 	 ness 	 	of	the	place	which	 make 	 s 	 	you	feel	 help 	 less 	 	and	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
and	once	you	make	it	there	,	the	big	question	is	where	to	start	.
and	you	find	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	.
when	i	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	are	 paleonto 	 logical 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	,	it	's	like	going	to	a	game	park	,	an	extinct	game	park	.
but	what	you	find	are	not	the	human	 remain 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	selam	and	lucy	,	on	a	day	-	to	-	day	 bas 	 is 	 	.
you	find	 elephant 	 s 	 	,	 rhino 	 s 	 	,	 monkey 	 s 	 	,	 pig 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
but	you	could	ask	,	how	could	these	large	 mammal 	 s 	 	live	in	 th 	 is 	 	desert	environment	?
of	course	,	they	can	not	,	but	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 al 	 ready 	 	that	the	environment	and	the	 carry 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	region	was	 drastic 	 ally 	 	different	from	what	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 less 	 on 	 	could	be	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	once	we	made	it	there	,	then	it	's	a	game	park	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	an	extinct	game	park	.
and	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	lived	in	that	game	park	,	but	 we 	 re 	 	just	the	 minor 	 ities 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	 wide 	 spread 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	that	we	are	.
to	tell	you	just	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	an	anecdote	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 r 	 arity 	 	,	i	was	going	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	every	year	and	would	do	 field 	 work 	 	here	,	and	the	 assist 	 ants 	 	,	of	course	,	 help 	 ed 	 	me	do	the	 survey 	 s 	 	.
they	would	find	a	bone	and	tell	me	,	``	here	is	what	you	're	looking	for	.	``
i	would	say	,	``	no	,	that	's	an	elephant	.	``
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	one	,	``	that	's	a	monkey	.	``	``	that	's	a	pig	,	``	etc	.
so	one	of	my	 assist 	 ants 	 	,	who	never	went	to	school	,	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	listen	,	zeray	.
you	either	do	n't	know	what	you	're	looking	for	,	or	you	're	looking	in	the	wrong	place	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	?	``	``	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 elephant 	 s 	 	and	 lion 	 s 	 	,	and	the	people	 we 	 re 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	and	went	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
let	's	go	 some 	 where 	 	else	.	``
well	,	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 tire 	 d 	 	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 ti 	 ring 	 	.
it	was	then	,	after	 s 	 uch 	 	hard	work	and	 man 	 y 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	 year 	 s 	 	that	we	found	selam	,	and	you	see	the	face	here	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	 sand 	 stone 	 	.
and	here	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 spin 	 al 	 	column	and	the	whole	 tors 	 o 	 	 en 	 case 	 d 	 	in	a	 sand 	 stone 	 	block	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	buried	by	a	river	.
what	you	have	here	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	but	 contain 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	amount	of	scientific	information	that	 help 	 s 	 	us	explore	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	human	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	and	most	complete	juvenile	human	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	ever	found	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 paleo 	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	,	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	piece	of	our	long	,	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	these	three	people	and	me	,	and	i	am	taking	the	 picture 	 s 	 	,	that	's	why	i	am	not	in	.
how	would	you	feel	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	me	?	you	have	 some 	 thing 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	in	your	hand	,	but	you	are	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	?
the	 feel 	 ing 	 	i	had	was	a	deep	and	quiet	happiness	and	 excit 	 ement 	 	,	of	course	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	a	huge	sense	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	of	making	 s 	 ure 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	is	safe	.
here	is	a	close	-	up	of	the	fossil	,	after	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	 clean 	 ing 	 	,	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	and	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	,	which	was	 ver 	 y 	 	long	,	and	i	had	to	 ex 	 pose 	 	the	 bone 	 s 	 	from	the	 sand 	 stone 	 	block	i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	in	the	previous	slide	.
it	took	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	a	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	like	the	second	birth	for	the	child	,	after	3.3	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	the	labor	was	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.
and	here	is	full	scale	--	it	's	a	 tin 	 y 	 	bone	.
and	in	the	middle	is	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	ethiopian	 tour 	 ism 	 	,	who	came	to	visit	the	national	museum	of	ethiopia	while	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	there	.
and	you	see	me	 worri 	 ed 	 	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	protect	my	child	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	 any 	 one 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	child	,	even	a	 mini 	 ster 	 	.
so	then	,	once	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	,	the	next	stage	is	to	know	what	it	is	.
once	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	,	then	it	was	possible	to	 compar 	 e 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	tell	that	she	 belong 	 ed 	 	to	the	human	family	tree	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 leg 	 s 	 	,	the	foot	,	and	some	 feature 	 s 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	that	she	 walk 	 ed 	 	 up 	 right 	 	,	and	 up 	 right 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	is	a	 hall 	 mark 	 	in	 human 	 ity 	 	.
but	in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	if	you	 compar 	 e 	 	the	skull	with	a	 compar 	 ably 	 	aged	chimpanzee	and	little	george	bush	here	,	you	see	that	you	have	 vert 	 ical 	 	 fore 	 head 	 	.
and	you	see	that	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	the	pre	-	frontal	cortex	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	.
you	do	n't	see	that	in	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	see	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 project 	 ing 	 	 can 	 ine 	 	.
so	she	 belong 	 s 	 	to	our	family	tree	,	but	 with 	 in 	 	that	,	of	course	,	you	do	 detail 	 ed 	 	analysis	,	and	we	know	now	that	she	 belong 	 s 	 	to	the	lucy	species	,	known	 a 	 s 	 	australopithecus	afarensis	.
the	next	 excit 	 ing 	 	question	is	,	girl	or	boy	?
and	how	old	was	she	when	she	 di 	 ed 	 	?
you	can	determine	the	 s 	 ex 	 	of	the	individual	based	on	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 tee 	 th 	 	.
how	?
you	know	,	in	 prim 	 ates 	 	,	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	sexual	 di 	 morph 	 ism 	 	,	which	 simpl 	 y 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 male 	 s 	 	are	 large 	 r 	 	than	 female 	 s 	 	and	 male 	 s 	 	have	 large 	 r 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	than	the	 female 	 s 	 	.
but	to	do	that	,	you	need	the	permanent	 dent 	 ition 	 	,	which	you	do	n't	see	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	have	here	are	the	baby	 tee 	 th 	 	.
but	using	the	ct	 s 	 canning 	 	technology	,	which	is	 normal 	 ly 	 	used	for	medical	 purpose 	 s 	 	,	you	can	go	deep	 in 	 to 	 	the	mouth	and	come	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	image	 show 	 ing 	 	you	both	the	baby	 tee 	 th 	 	here	and	the	still	-	growing	adult	 tee 	 th 	 	here	.
so	when	you	measure	 t 	 hose 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	,	it	was	clear	that	she	 start 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	girl	with	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 can 	 ine 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	.
and	to	know	how	old	she	was	when	she	 di 	 ed 	 	,	what	you	do	is	you	do	an	 inform 	 ed 	 	estimate	,	and	you	say	,	how	much	time	would	be	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	form	 th 	 is 	 	amount	of	 tee 	 th 	 	,	and	the	answer	was	three	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	girl	 di 	 ed 	 	when	she	was	about	three	,	3.3	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	,	with	all	that	information	,	the	big	question	is	--	what	do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	what	 do 	 es 	 	she	tell	us	?
to	answer	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	we	can	phrase	 an 	 other 	 	question	.
what	do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	about	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	?
we	want	to	know	how	they	 look 	 ed 	 	like	,	how	they	 behav 	 ed 	 	,	how	they	 walk 	 ed 	 	around	,	and	how	they	lived	and	grew	up	.
and	among	the	 answer 	 s 	 	that	you	can	get	from	 th 	 is 	 	skeleton	are	 include 	 d 	 	:	first	,	 th 	 is 	 	skeleton	 document 	 s 	 	,	for	the	first	time	,	how	 infant 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	over	three	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	second	,	she	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	she	 walk 	 ed 	 	 up 	 right 	 	,	but	had	some	 adapt 	 ation 	 	for	tree	 climb 	 ing 	 	.
and	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	is	the	brain	in	 th 	 is 	 	child	was	still	growing	.
at	age	three	,	if	you	have	a	still	-	growing	brain	,	it	's	a	human	behavior	.
in	 chimp 	 s 	 	,	by	age	three	,	the	brain	is	 form 	 ed 	 	over	90	percent	.
that	's	why	they	can	cope	with	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	after	birth	--	 fast 	 er 	 	than	us	,	 any 	 way 	 	.
but	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	grow	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
that	's	why	we	need	care	from	our	 parent 	 s 	 	.
but	that	care	 mean 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	you	learn	.
you	 s 	 pend 	 	more	time	with	your	 parent 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	 extend 	 ed 	 	 depend 	 ence 	 	of	human	children	on	 the 	 ir 	 	family	or	 parent 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	still	-	growing	brain	in	 th 	 is 	 	individual	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	 child 	 hood 	 	,	which	 requir 	 es 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	social	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	social	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	 emerge 	 d 	 	over	three	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	,	by	 be 	 ing 	 	at	the	 cus 	 p 	 	of	our	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	selam	 un 	 ites 	 	us	all	and	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	 un 	 ique 	 	account	on	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	human	.
but	not	 every 	 thing 	 	was	human	,	and	i	will	give	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 hy 	 oid 	 	bone	.	it	's	a	bone	which	is	right	here	.
it	 support 	 s 	 	your	tongue	from	 be 	 hind 	 	.
it	's	,	in	a	way	,	your	voice	box	.
it	 determine 	 s 	 	the	type	of	voice	you	produce	.
it	was	not	known	in	the	fossil	record	,	and	we	have	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	skeleton	.
when	we	did	the	analysis	of	 th 	 is 	 	bone	,	it	was	clear	that	it	 look 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	chimp	-	like	,	chimpanzee	-	like	.
so	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	there	3.3	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	to	hear	when	 th 	 is 	 	girl	was	 cry 	 ing 	 	out	for	her	mother	,	she	would	have	 sound 	 ed 	 	more	like	a	chimpanzee	than	a	human	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	're	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	``	so	,	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	ape	feature	,	human	feature	,	ape	feature	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	tell	us	?	``
you	know	,	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	for	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 demonst 	 rates 	 	that	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	changing	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	and	 progress 	 ively 	 	,	and	that	evolution	is	in	the	making	.
to	summarize	the	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	fossil	,	we	can	say	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	.
up	to	now	,	the	knowledge	that	we	had	about	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	came	 essential 	 ly 	 	from	adult	 individual 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 fossil 	 s 	 	,	the	baby	 fossil 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
they	do	n't	preserve	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	.
so	the	knowledge	that	we	had	about	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	on	how	they	 look 	 ed 	 	like	,	how	they	 behav 	 ed 	 	,	was	kind	of	 bias 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
imagine	 some 	 body 	 	coming	from	mars	and	his	job	is	to	report	on	the	type	of	people	 occupy 	 ing 	 	our	planet	earth	,	and	you	hide	all	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	the	children	,	and	he	 go 	 es 	 	back	and	 report 	 s 	 	.
can	you	imagine	how	much	 bias 	 ed 	 	his	report	would	be	?
that	's	what	 some 	 how 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	so	far	in	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	the	fossil	children	,	so	i	think	the	new	fossil	 fix 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
so	,	i	think	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	question	at	the	end	is	,	what	do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	learn	from	 specimen 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	from	our	past	in	general	?
of	course	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 ex 	 tract 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	huge	amount	of	scientific	information	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	human	,	you	know	,	the	 man 	 y 	 	human	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	that	have	 exist 	 ed 	 	over	the	past	six	million	 year 	 s 	 	--	and	there	are	more	than	10	--	they	did	not	have	the	knowledge	,	the	technology	and	 sophistic 	 ations 	 	that	we	,	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	,	have	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	if	 th 	 is 	 	species	,	ancient	species	,	would	travel	in	time	and	see	us	 to 	 day 	 	,	they	would	 ver 	 y 	 	much	be	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 leg 	 acy 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 be 	 came 	 	the	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	of	the	most	 success 	 ful 	 	species	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	aware	of	 th 	 is 	 	future	 leg 	 acy 	 	,	but	they	did	great	.
now	the	question	is	,	we	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	in	a	position	to	decide	about	the	future	of	our	planet	,	possibly	more	.
so	the	question	is	,	are	we	up	to	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	?
and	can	we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	better	than	these	primitive	,	small	-	brained	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	?
among	the	most	 press 	 ing 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	our	species	is	 face 	 d 	 	with	 to 	 day 	 	are	the	chronic	 problem 	 s 	 	of	africa	.
 needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	list	them	here	,	and	there	are	more	 compete 	 nt 	 	people	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
still	,	in	my	opinion	,	we	have	two	 choice 	 s 	 	.
one	is	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	see	a	poor	,	ill	,	 cry 	 ing 	 	africa	,	 carry 	 ing 	 	 gun 	 s 	 	,	that	 depend 	 s 	 	on	other	people	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	or	to	promote	an	africa	which	is	confident	,	 peace 	 ful 	 	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	,	but	 cogniz 	 ant 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	huge	 problem 	 s 	 	and	great	 value 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
i	am	for	the	second	option	,	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	are	.
and	the	key	is	to	promote	a	positive	african	attitude	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	africa	.
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	africans	 concent 	 rate 	 	--	i	am	from	ethiopia	,	by	the	way	--	we	 concent 	 rate 	 	too	much	on	how	we	are	 s 	 een 	 	from	 else 	 where 	 	,	or	from	 out 	 side 	 	.
i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	promote	in	a	more	positive	way	on	how	we	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
that	's	what	i	call	positive	african	attitude	.
so	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	like	to	say	,	so	let	's	help	africa	walk	 up 	 right 	 	and	forward	,	then	we	all	can	be	proud	of	our	future	 leg 	 acy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	.
thank	you	.
