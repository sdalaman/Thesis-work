i	know	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	.
you	think	i	've	lost	my	way	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	's	going	to	come	on	the	stage	in	a	minute	and	guide	me	 gent 	 ly 	 	back	to	my	seat	.
i	get	that	all	the	time	in	dubai	.
``	here	on	 holi 	 day 	 	are	you	,	dear	?	``
``	come	to	visit	the	children	?
how	long	are	you	 stay 	 ing 	 	?	``
well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	hope	for	a	while	 long 	 er 	 	yet	.
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	living	and	 teach 	 ing 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	for	over	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	in	that	time	,	i	have	 s 	 een 	 	a	lot	of	 change 	 s 	 	.
now	that	statistic	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 shock 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	want	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	language	loss	and	the	 global 	 ization 	 	of	english	.
i	want	to	tell	you	about	my	friend	who	was	 teach 	 ing 	 	english	to	 adult 	 s 	 	in	abu	dhabi	.
and	one	fine	day	,	she	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	garden	to	teach	them	some	nature	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	.
but	it	was	she	who	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 learn 	 ing 	 	all	the	arabic	 word 	 s 	 	for	the	local	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	uses	--	 medic 	 in 	 al 	 	uses	,	 cosmetic 	 s 	 	,	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	 herb 	 al 	 	.
how	did	 t 	 hose 	 	 student 	 s 	 	get	all	that	knowledge	?
of	course	,	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	and	even	 the 	 ir 	 	great	-	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	tell	you	how	 import 	 ant 	 	it	is	to	be	able	to	communicate	 a 	 cross 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	.
but	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	 language 	 s 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	at	an	unprecedented	rate	.
a	language	dies	every	14	 day 	 s 	 	.
now	,	at	the	same	time	,	english	is	the	 un 	 disput 	 ed 	 	global	language	.
could	there	be	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	?
well	i	do	n't	know	.
but	i	do	know	that	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	a	lot	of	 change 	 s 	 	.
when	i	first	came	out	to	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	,	i	came	to	kuwait	in	the	 day 	 s 	 	when	it	was	still	a	 hard 	 ship 	 	post	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	not	that	long	ago	.
that	is	a	little	bit	too	early	.
but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	i	was	 recruit 	 ed 	 	by	the	british	council	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	about	25	other	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	non	-	muslims	to	teach	in	the	state	 school 	 s 	 	there	in	kuwait	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	teach	english	 be 	 cause 	 	the	government	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 modern 	 ize 	 	the	country	and	to	empower	the	 citizen 	 s 	 	through	education	.
and	of	course	,	the	u.k.	 benefit 	 ed 	 	from	some	of	that	 love 	 ly 	 	oil	wealth	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	major	change	that	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	--	how	 teach 	 ing 	 	english	 ha 	 s 	 	 morph 	 ed 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 mutual 	 ly 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	practice	to	 be 	 coming 	 	a	massive	 inter 	 national 	 	business	that	it	is	 to 	 day 	 	.
no	 long 	 er 	 	just	a	foreign	language	on	the	school	curriculum	,	and	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	sole	domain	of	mother	england	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	 band 	 wagon 	 	for	every	english	-	 s 	 peaking 	 	nation	on	earth	.
and	why	not	?
after	all	,	the	best	education	--	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	 lat 	 est 	 	world	university	 rank 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	is	to	be	found	in	the	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	of	the	u.k.	and	the	u.s	.
so	 every 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	have	an	english	education	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	.
but	if	you	're	not	a	native	speaker	,	you	have	to	pass	a	test	.
now	can	it	be	right	to	reject	a	student	on	 linguist 	 ic 	 	ability	 al 	 one 	 	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	you	have	a	computer	scientist	who	's	a	 gen 	 ius 	 	.
would	he	need	the	same	language	 a 	 s 	 	a	lawyer	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	?
well	,	i	do	n't	think	so	.
we	english	 teacher 	 s 	 	reject	them	all	the	time	.
we	put	a	stop	sign	,	and	we	stop	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 track 	 s 	 	.
they	ca	n't	pursue	 the 	 ir 	 	dream	any	 long 	 er 	 	,	'	til	they	get	english	.
now	let	me	put	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	:	if	i	met	a	 mono 	 lingual 	 	dutch	speaker	who	had	the	cure	for	cancer	,	would	i	stop	him	from	 enter 	 ing 	 	my	british	university	?
i	do	n't	think	so	.
but	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	that	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	do	.
we	english	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	the	 gate 	 keeper 	 s 	 	.
and	you	have	to	satisfy	us	first	that	your	english	is	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
now	it	can	be	 danger 	 ous 	 	to	give	too	much	power	to	a	narrow	segment	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	the	 bar 	 rier 	 	would	be	too	universal	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
``	but	,	``	i	hear	you	say	,	``	what	about	the	research	?
it	's	all	in	english	.	``
so	the	 book 	 s 	 	are	in	english	,	the	 journal 	 s 	 	are	 d 	 one 	 	in	english	,	but	that	is	a	self	-	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	 prop 	 he 	 cy 	 	.
it	 feed 	 s 	 	the	english	 requir 	 ement 	 	.
and	so	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
i	ask	you	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 transl 	 ation 	 	?
if	you	think	about	the	islamic	 gold 	 en 	 	age	,	there	was	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 transl 	 ation 	 	then	.
they	 transl 	 ated 	 	from	latin	and	greek	 in 	 to 	 	arabic	,	 in 	 to 	 	persian	,	and	then	it	was	 transl 	 ated 	 	on	 in 	 to 	 	the	germanic	 language 	 s 	 	of	europe	and	the	 rom 	 ance 	 	 language 	 s 	 	.
and	so	light	 s 	 hone 	 	 up 	 on 	 	the	dark	 age 	 s 	 	of	europe	.
now	do	n't	get	me	wrong	;	i	am	not	against	 teach 	 ing 	 	english	,	all	you	english	 teacher 	 s 	 	out	there	.
i	love	it	that	we	have	a	global	language	.
we	need	one	 to 	 day 	 	more	than	ever	.
but	i	am	against	using	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bar 	 rier 	 	.
do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	end	up	with	600	 language 	 s 	 	and	the	main	one	 be 	 ing 	 	english	,	or	chinese	?
we	need	more	than	that	.	where	do	we	draw	the	line	?
 th 	 is 	 	system	 equate 	 s 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	with	a	knowledge	of	english	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	.
and	i	want	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	that	the	 giant 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 shoulder 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	's	 intelligent 	 s 	 ia 	 	stand	did	not	have	to	have	english	,	they	did	n't	have	to	pass	an	english	test	.
case	in	point	,	einstein	.
he	,	by	the	way	,	was	 consider 	 ed 	 	 remedi 	 al 	 	at	school	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	,	in	fact	,	 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	.
but	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	for	the	world	,	he	did	not	have	to	pass	an	english	test	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	did	n't	start	 un 	 til 	 	1964	with	toefl	,	the	american	test	of	english	.
now	it	's	 explode 	 d 	 	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 test 	 s 	 	of	english	.
and	 million 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	 student 	 s 	 	take	these	 test 	 s 	 	every	year	.
now	you	might	think	,	you	and	me	,	``	 t 	 hose 	 	 fee 	 s 	 	are	n't	bad	,	they	're	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	``	but	they	are	 prohibit 	 ive 	 	to	so	 man 	 y 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	poor	people	.
so	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	 reject 	 ing 	 	them	.
it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	mind	a	 head 	 line 	 	i	saw	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	:	``	education	:	the	great	divide	.	``
now	i	get	it	,	i	understand	why	people	would	want	to	focus	on	english	.
they	want	to	give	 the 	 ir 	 	children	the	best	chance	in	life	.
and	to	do	that	,	they	need	a	western	education	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	the	best	 job 	 s 	 	go	to	people	out	of	the	western	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	that	i	put	on	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
it	's	a	 circul 	 ar 	 	thing	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	a	story	about	two	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	two	english	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	an	experiment	to	do	with	 genetic 	 s 	 	and	the	 fore 	 limb 	 s 	 	and	the	hind	 limb 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	.
but	they	could	n't	get	the	 result 	 s 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	know	what	to	do	,	 un 	 til 	 	 a 	 long 	 	came	a	german	scientist	who	 real 	 ized 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	using	two	 word 	 s 	 	for	 fore 	 limb 	 	and	hind	limb	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 genetic 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	 different 	 iate 	 	and	 n 	 either 	 	 do 	 es 	 	german	.
so	 bing 	 o 	 	,	problem	 solve 	 d 	 	.
if	you	ca	n't	think	a	thought	,	you	are	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
but	if	 an 	 other 	 	language	can	think	that	thought	,	then	,	by	 co 	 oper 	 ating 	 	,	we	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	and	learn	so	much	more	.
my	daughter	came	to	england	from	kuwait	.
she	had	 stud 	 ied 	 	science	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	in	arabic	.
it	's	an	arabic	medium	school	.
she	had	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	english	at	her	 gram 	 mar 	 	school	.
and	she	was	the	best	in	the	class	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	.
which	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	when	 student 	 s 	 	come	to	us	from	 a 	 broad 	 	,	we	may	not	be	giving	them	 en 	 ough 	 	credit	for	what	they	know	,	and	they	know	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	language	.
when	a	language	dies	,	we	do	n't	know	what	we	lose	with	that	language	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	--	i	do	n't	know	if	you	saw	it	on	cnn	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	--	they	 g 	 ave 	 	the	heroes	 a 	 ward 	 	to	a	young	kenyan	shepherd	boy	who	could	n't	 stud 	 y 	 	at	night	in	his	village	,	like	all	the	village	children	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 ker 	 os 	 ene 	 	lamp	,	it	had	smoke	and	it	 damage 	 d 	 	his	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	 any 	 way 	 	,	there	was	never	 en 	 ough 	 	 ker 	 os 	 ene 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	 do 	 es 	 	a	dollar	a	day	buy	for	you	?
so	he	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	cost	-	free	solar	lamp	.
and	now	the	children	in	his	village	get	the	same	 grade 	 s 	 	at	school	 a 	 s 	 	the	children	who	have	 electric 	 ity 	 	at	home	.
when	he	 receiv 	 ed 	 	his	 a 	 ward 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	these	 love 	 ly 	 	 word 	 s 	 	:	``	the	children	can	lead	africa	from	what	it	is	 to 	 day 	 	,	a	dark	continent	,	to	a	light	continent	.	``
a	simple	idea	,	but	it	could	have	 s 	 uch 	 	far	-	 reach 	 ing 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
people	who	have	no	light	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	physical	or	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	,	can	not	pass	our	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	never	know	what	they	know	.
let	us	not	keep	them	and	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	dark	.
