i	would	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	bet	that	i	'm	the	 dumb 	 est 	 	guy	in	the	room	 be 	 cause 	 	i	could	n't	get	through	school	.	i	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	school	.
but	what	i	 k 	 new 	 	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	early	age	was	that	i	 love 	 d 	 	money	and	i	 love 	 d 	 	business	and	i	 love 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	thing	,	and	i	was	raised	to	be	an	entrepreneur	,	and	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	passionate	about	ever	since	--	and	i	've	never	spoken	about	 th 	 is 	 	ever	,	 un 	 til 	 	now	--	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	time	 any 	 one 	 	's	ever	heard	it	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	my	wife	three	 day 	 s 	 	ago	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	are	you	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?	``	and	i	told	her	--	is	that	i	think	we	 mis 	 s 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	find	these	 kid 	 s 	 	who	have	the	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	,	and	to	groom	them	or	show	them	that	 be 	 ing 	 	an	entrepreneur	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	cool	thing	.
it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	a	bad	thing	and	is	 vil 	 ified 	 	,	which	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	a	lot	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 kid 	 s 	 	,	when	we	grow	up	,	have	 dream 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	 pass 	 ions 	 	,	and	we	have	 vision 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 how 	 	we	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	.
we	get	told	that	we	need	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	or	be	more	focused	or	get	a	tutor	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	got	me	a	tutor	in	french	,	and	i	still	suck	in	french	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	the	highest	-	rated	 lectur 	 er 	 	at	mit	's	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	master	's	program	.
and	it	was	a	 s 	 peaking 	 	event	in	front	of	 group 	 s 	 	of	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	.
when	i	was	in	grade	two	,	i	won	a	city	-	wide	 s 	 peaking 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	had	ever	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	kid	's	a	good	speaker	.
he	ca	n't	focus	,	but	he	 love 	 s 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	and	 get 	 ting 	 	people	 energ 	 ized 	 	.	``
no	one	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	get	him	a	coach	in	 s 	 peaking 	 	.	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	get	me	a	tutor	in	what	i	suck	at	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	show	these	 trait 	 s 	 	--	and	we	need	to	start	looking	for	them	--	i	think	we	should	be	raising	 kid 	 s 	 	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 lawyer 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	the	school	system	is	 groom 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	to	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	let	's	be	a	lawyer	or	let	's	be	a	doctor	,	``	and	we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	that	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	no	one	ever	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	be	an	entrepreneur	.	``
 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	are	people	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	a	lot	of	them	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	who	have	these	 idea 	 s 	 	and	these	 pass 	 ions 	 	or	see	these	 need 	 s 	 	in	the	world	and	we	decide	to	stand	up	and	do	it	.
and	we	put	 every 	 thing 	 	on	the	line	to	make	that	stuff	happen	.
we	have	the	ability	to	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	around	us	that	want	to	kind	of	build	that	dream	with	us	,	and	i	think	if	we	could	get	 kid 	 s 	 	to	embrace	the	idea	at	a	young	age	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	,	we	could	change	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	world	that	is	a	problem	 to 	 day 	 	.
every	problem	that	's	out	there	,	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	idea	for	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	kid	,	 no 	 body 	 	can	say	it	ca	n't	happen	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	too	dumb	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	you	could	n't	figure	it	out	.
i	think	we	have	an	 oblig 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	and	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	to	start	 teach 	 ing 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	to	fish	 in 	 stead 	 	of	giving	them	the	fish	--	the	old	 par 	 able 	 	:	``	if	you	give	a	man	a	fish	,	you	feed	him	for	a	day	.
if	you	teach	a	man	to	fish	,	you	feed	him	for	a	 life 	 time 	 	.	``
if	we	can	teach	our	 kid 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	--	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	show	 t 	 hose 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	to	be	--	like	we	teach	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	have	science	 gift 	 s 	 	to	go	on	in	science	,	what	if	we	saw	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	had	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	and	taught	them	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	?
we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	all	these	 kid 	 s 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	 business 	 es 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	government	 hand 	 out 	 s 	 	.
what	we	do	is	we	 s 	 it 	 	and	teach	our	 kid 	 s 	 	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	should	n't	do	:	do	n't	hit	;	do	n't	bite	;	do	n't	 s 	 wear 	 	.
right	now	we	teach	our	 kid 	 s 	 	to	go	after	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 job 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	and	the	school	system	 teach 	 es 	 	them	to	go	after	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 be 	 ing 	 	a	doctor	and	 be 	 ing 	 	a	lawyer	and	 be 	 ing 	 	an	 account 	 ant 	 	and	a	 dent 	 ist 	 	and	a	teacher	and	a	pilot	.
and	the	media	 say 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	if	we	could	go	out	and	be	a	model	or	a	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	or	a	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	hero	like	luongo	,	crosby	.
our	mba	 program 	 s 	 	do	not	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	that	i	 avoid 	 ed 	 	an	mba	program	--	other	than	the	fact	that	i	could	n't	get	 in 	 to 	 	any	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	a	61	percent	average	out	of	high	school	and	then	61	percent	average	at	the	 on 	 ly 	 	school	in	canada	that	 accept 	 ed 	 	me	,	carlton	--	but	our	mba	 program 	 s 	 	do	n't	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
they	teach	them	to	go	work	in	 corporation 	 s 	 	.
so	who	's	 start 	 ing 	 	these	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	?	it	's	these	random	few	people	.
even	in	popular	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	book	i	've	ever	found	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	should	be	on	all	of	your	 read 	 ing 	 	 list 	 s 	 	--	the	 on 	 ly 	 	book	i	've	ever	found	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	entrepreneur	 in 	 to 	 	the	hero	is	``	atlas	shrugged	.	``
 every 	 thing 	 	else	in	the	world	 tend 	 s 	 	to	look	at	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	and	say	that	we	're	bad	people	.
i	look	at	even	my	family	.
both	my	 grand 	 father 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.	my	dad	was	an	entrepreneur	.
both	my	brother	and	sister	and	i	,	all	three	of	us	own	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	we	all	 decide 	 d 	 	to	start	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	we	fit	.
we	did	n't	fit	in	the	normal	work	.	we	could	n't	work	for	 some 	 body 	 	else	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	too	 s 	 tub 	 born 	 	and	we	have	all	these	other	 trait 	 s 	 	.
but	 kid 	 s 	 	could	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	'm	a	big	part	of	a	couple	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	'	 organ 	 ization 	 	and	the	young	 pre 	 sidents 	 	'	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
i	just	came	back	from	 s 	 peaking 	 	in	barcelona	at	the	ypo	global	 con 	 ference 	 	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	that	i	met	over	there	who	's	an	entrepreneur	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	school	.
i	have	18	out	of	the	19	 sign 	 s 	 	of	attention	 defici 	 t 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	thing	right	here	is	 freak 	 ing 	 	me	out	.
it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	why	i	'm	a	little	bit	 panic 	 ked 	 	right	now	--	other	than	all	the	 c 	 affe 	 ine 	 	that	i	've	had	and	the	sugar	--	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 creep 	 y 	 	for	an	entrepreneur	.
attention	 defici 	 t 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	,	 bi 	 polar 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	.
do	you	know	that	 bi 	 polar 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	is	 nick 	 named 	 	the	ceo	disease	?
ted	turner	's	got	it	.	steve	 job 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	it	.
all	three	of	the	 founder 	 s 	 	of	netscape	had	it	.
i	could	go	on	and	on	.
 kid 	 s 	 	--	you	can	see	these	 sign 	 s 	 	in	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	we	're	giving	them	ritalin	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	do	n't	be	an	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	type	.
fit	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	other	system	and	try	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	student	.	``
sorry	,	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	are	n't	 student 	 s 	 	.
we	fast	-	track	.	we	figure	out	the	game	.
i	stole	 essay 	 s 	 	.	i	 cheat 	 ed 	 	on	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	.
i	 hire 	 d 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	do	my	 account 	 ing 	 	 assign 	 ments 	 	in	university	for	13	 con 	 s 	 ecutive 	 	 assign 	 ments 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	an	entrepreneur	you	do	n't	do	 account 	 ing 	 	,	you	hire	 account 	 ants 	 	.
so	i	just	 figur 	 ed 	 	that	out	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	i	can	admit	i	 cheat 	 ed 	 	in	university	;	most	of	you	wo	n't	.

i	open	up	chapter	eight	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 budget 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	told	the	author	,	after	they	did	my	interview	,	that	i	 cheat 	 ed 	 	in	that	same	course	.
and	she	thought	it	was	too	funny	to	not	include	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
but	 kid 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	these	 sign 	 s 	 	in	them	.
the	definition	of	an	entrepreneur	is	``	a	person	who	 organize 	 s 	 	,	 oper 	 ates 	 	and	 assum 	 es 	 	the	risk	of	a	business	venture	.	``
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	you	have	to	go	to	an	mba	program	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	you	have	to	get	through	school	.
it	just	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	few	 thing 	 s 	 	have	to	feel	right	in	your	gut	.
and	we	've	heard	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	``	is	it	nurture	or	is	it	nature	,	``	right	?
is	it	thing	one	or	thing	two	?	what	is	it	?
well	,	i	do	n't	think	it	's	either	.	i	think	it	can	be	both	.
i	was	 groom 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	entrepreneur	.
when	i	was	growing	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	kid	,	i	had	no	choice	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	taught	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	early	,	young	age	--	when	my	dad	 real 	 ized 	 	i	was	n't	going	to	fit	 in 	 to 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	that	was	 be 	 ing 	 	taught	to	me	in	school	--	that	he	could	teach	me	to	figure	out	business	at	an	early	age	.
he	 groom 	 ed 	 	us	,	the	three	of	us	,	to	hate	the	thought	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	job	and	to	love	the	fact	of	creating	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	we	could	employ	other	people	.
my	first	little	business	venture	:	i	was	seven	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	was	in	winnipeg	,	and	i	was	 ly 	 ing 	 	in	my	 bed 	 room 	 	with	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	long	 extens 	 ion 	 	 cord 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	 call 	 ing 	 	all	the	dry	 clean 	 ers 	 	in	winnipeg	to	find	out	how	much	would	the	dry	 clean 	 ers 	 	pay	me	for	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	.
and	my	mom	came	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	where	are	you	going	to	get	the	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	to	sell	to	the	dry	 clean 	 ers 	 	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	go	and	look	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	.	``
and	we	went	down	to	the	 base 	 ment 	 	.	and	i	 open 	 ed 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	 cup 	 board 	 	.
and	there	was	about	a	thousand	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	that	i	'd	 collect 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	when	i	told	her	i	was	going	out	to	play	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	i	was	going	door	to	door	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	to	collect	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	to	put	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	to	sell	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	saw	her	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	before	that	--	you	could	get	paid	.	they	used	to	pay	you	two	 cent 	 s 	 	per	coat	 hang 	 er 	 	.
so	i	was	just	like	,	well	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	.
and	so	i	'll	just	go	get	them	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	she	would	n't	want	me	to	go	get	them	,	so	i	just	did	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 negoti 	 ate 	 	with	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	person	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	me	three	 cent 	 s 	 	and	i	got	him	up	to	three	and	a	half	.
i	even	 k 	 new 	 	at	a	seven	-	year	-	old	age	that	i	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	a	 fraction 	 al 	 	percent	of	a	cent	,	and	people	would	pay	that	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 multi 	 plied 	 	up	.
at	seven	 year 	 s 	 	old	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	.	i	got	three	and	a	half	 cent 	 s 	 	for	a	thousand	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	.
i	 s 	 old 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	plate	 protect 	 ors 	 	door	to	door	.
my	dad	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	me	go	find	 some 	 one 	 	who	would	sell	me	these	 thing 	 s 	 	at	 whole 	 sale 	 	.
and	at	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	around	in	the	city	of	sudbury	selling	 licens 	 e 	 	plate	 protect 	 ors 	 	door	to	door	to	 house 	 s 	 	.
and	i	remember	 th 	 is 	 	one	 custom 	 er 	 	so	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 al 	 so 	 	did	some	other	stuff	with	these	 client 	 s 	 	.
i	 s 	 old 	 	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
and	he	would	n't	buy	a	 news 	 paper 	 	from	me	ever	.
but	i	was	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	i	was	going	to	get	him	to	buy	a	 licens 	 e 	 	plate	 protect 	 or 	 	.
and	he	's	like	,	``	well	,	we	do	n't	need	one	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	you	've	got	two	 car 	 s 	 	.	.	.	``	--	i	'm	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	'm	like	,	``	but	you	have	two	 car 	 s 	 	and	they	do	n't	have	 licens 	 e 	 	plate	 protect 	 ors 	 	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	know	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	car	here	's	got	one	 licens 	 e 	 	plate	that	's	all	 crumple 	 d 	 	up	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	's	my	wife	's	car	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	we	just	test	one	on	the	front	of	your	wife	's	car	and	see	if	it	 last 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	.	``
so	i	 k 	 new 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 car 	 s 	 	with	two	 licens 	 e 	 	 plate 	 s 	 	on	each	.
if	i	could	n't	sell	all	four	,	i	could	at	 l 	 east 	 	get	one	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	at	a	young	age	.
i	did	 com 	 ic 	 	book	 arbitr 	 age 	 	.
when	i	was	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	 s 	 old 	 	 com 	 ic 	 	 book 	 s 	 	out	of	our	cottage	on	georgian	 ba 	 y 	 	.
and	i	would	go	 bi 	 king 	 	up	to	the	end	of	the	beach	and	buy	all	the	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	from	the	poor	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	would	go	back	to	the	other	end	of	the	beach	and	sell	them	to	the	rich	 kid 	 s 	 	.
but	it	was	obvious	to	me	,	right	?	buy	low	,	sell	high	.
you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	demand	over	here	that	 ha 	 s 	 	money	.
do	n't	try	to	sell	to	the	poor	 kid 	 s 	 	;	they	do	n't	have	cash	.	the	rich	people	do	.	go	get	some	.
so	that	's	obvious	,	right	.
it	's	like	a	 recess 	 ion 	 	.	so	,	there	's	a	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
there	's	still	13	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	 circul 	 ating 	 	in	the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
go	get	some	of	that	.	and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	at	a	young	age	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	do	n't	reveal	your	source	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	got	beat	up	after	about	four	 week 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	rich	 kid 	 s 	 	found	out	where	i	was	 buy 	 ing 	 	my	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	from	,	and	he	did	n't	like	the	fact	that	he	was	 pay 	 ing 	 	a	lot	more	.
i	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	get	a	paper	route	at	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	a	paper	route	,	but	at	10	,	my	dad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	going	to	be	your	next	business	.	``
so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	would	he	get	me	one	,	but	i	had	to	get	two	,	and	then	he	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	hire	 some 	 one 	 	to	deliver	half	the	 paper 	 s 	 	,	which	i	did	,	and	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 collect 	 ing 	 	 tip 	 s 	 	was	where	you	made	all	the	money	.
so	i	would	collect	the	 tip 	 s 	 	and	get	payment	.
so	i	would	go	and	collect	for	all	the	 paper 	 s 	 	.
he	could	just	deliver	them	.
 be 	 cause 	 	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	i	could	make	the	money	.
by	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	i	was	 definite 	 ly 	 	not	going	to	be	an	 employ 	 ee 	 	.
my	dad	owned	an	 auto 	 motive 	 	and	industrial	repair	shop	.
he	had	all	these	old	 auto 	 motive 	 	 part 	 s 	 	 ly 	 ing 	 	around	.
they	had	 th 	 is 	 	old	 bra 	 s 	 s 	 	and	 cop 	 per 	 	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	what	he	did	with	it	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	just	 throw 	 s 	 	it	out	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	would	n't	 some 	 body 	 	pay	you	for	that	?	``	and	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	 may 	 be 	 	.	``
remember	at	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	so	34	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	saw	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
i	saw	there	was	money	in	garbage	.
and	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	it	from	all	the	 auto 	 motive 	 	 shop 	 s 	 	in	the	area	on	my	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
and	then	my	dad	would	drive	me	on	saturdays	to	a	scrap	metal	 recycl 	 er 	 	where	i	got	paid	.
and	i	thought	that	was	kind	of	cool	.
 strange 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	're	building	1-800	-	got	-	junk	?
and	making	money	off	that	too	.
i	built	these	little	 pin 	 cushion 	 s 	 	when	i	was	11	 year 	 s 	 	old	in	 cub 	 s 	 	,	and	we	made	these	pin	 cushion 	 s 	 	for	our	 mom 	 s 	 	for	mother	's	day	.
and	you	made	these	 pin 	 cushion 	 s 	 	out	of	 wood 	 en 	 	 clothe 	 spin 	 s 	 	--	when	we	used	to	hang	 clothe 	 s 	 	on	 clothe 	 s 	 lines 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	you	'd	make	these	 chair 	 s 	 	.
and	i	had	these	little	 pil 	 low 	 s 	 	that	i	would	sew	up	.
and	you	could	stuff	 pin 	 s 	 	in	them	.
 be 	 cause 	 	people	used	to	sew	and	they	 need 	 ed 	 	a	pin	cushion	.
but	what	i	 real 	 ized 	 	was	that	you	had	to	have	 option 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	spray	 paint 	 ed 	 	a	whole	bunch	of	them	 brow 	 n 	 	.
and	then	when	i	went	to	the	door	,	it	was	n't	,	``	do	you	want	to	buy	one	?	``
it	was	,	``	which	color	would	you	like	?	``
like	i	'm	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	;	you	're	not	going	to	say	no	to	me	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	have	two	 option 	 s 	 	--	you	have	the	 brow 	 n 	 	one	or	the	clear	one	.
so	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	 less 	 on 	 	at	a	young	age	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	manual	labor	 re 	 ally 	 	 suck 	 s 	 	.
right	,	like	cutting	 lawn 	 s 	 	is	brutal	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	to	cut	 lawn 	 s 	 	all	summer	for	all	of	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	and	get	paid	to	do	that	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 recur 	 ring 	 	revenue	from	one	client	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
that	if	i	land	 th 	 is 	 	client	once	,	and	every	week	i	get	paid	by	that	person	,	that	's	way	better	than	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	one	 clothe 	 spin 	 	thing	to	one	person	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	sell	them	more	.
so	i	love	that	 recur 	 ring 	 	revenue	model	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	learn	at	a	young	age	.
remember	,	i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 groom 	 ed 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	was	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	have	 job 	 s 	 	.
i	would	 c 	 addy 	 	,	i	would	go	to	the	golf	course	and	 c 	 addy 	 	for	people	.
but	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	one	hill	on	our	golf	course	,	the	13th	hole	that	had	 th 	 is 	 	huge	hill	.
and	people	could	never	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 bag 	 s 	 	up	it	.
so	i	would	 s 	 it 	 	there	with	a	lawn	chair	and	just	carry	up	all	the	people	who	did	n't	have	 cad 	 dies 	 	.
i	would	carry	 the 	 ir 	 	golf	 bag 	 s 	 	up	to	the	top	,	and	they	'd	pay	me	a	dollar	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	five	 hour 	 s 	 	to	haul	some	guy	's	bag	around	and	get	paid	10	 buck 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	like	,	``	that	's	stupid	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	work	for	five	 hour 	 s 	 	.
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	.	``	you	just	figure	out	a	way	to	make	more	money	 fast 	 er 	 	.
every	week	,	i	would	go	to	the	corner	store	and	buy	all	these	 pop 	 s 	 	.
then	i	would	go	up	and	deliver	them	to	these	70	-	year	-	old	women	 play 	 ing 	 	bridge	.
and	they	'd	give	me	 the 	 ir 	 	 order 	 s 	 	for	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	week	.
and	then	i	'd	just	deliver	pop	and	i	'd	just	charge	twice	.
and	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	market	.	you	did	n't	need	 contract 	 s 	 	.
you	just	 need 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	supply	and	demand	and	 th 	 is 	 	audience	who	 b 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	you	.
these	women	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	go	to	 any 	 body 	 	else	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 like 	 d 	 	me	,	and	i	kind	of	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	.
i	went	and	got	golf	 ball 	 s 	 	from	golf	 course 	 s 	 	.
but	 every 	 body 	 	else	was	looking	in	the	bush	and	looking	in	the	 d 	 itch 	 es 	 	for	golf	 ball 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	like	,	screw	that	.	they	're	all	in	the	pond	and	 no 	 body 	 	's	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	pond	.
so	i	would	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pond 	 s 	 	and	crawl	around	and	pick	them	up	with	my	 to 	 es 	 	.
you	just	pick	them	up	with	both	feet	.
you	ca	n't	do	it	on	stage	.
you	get	the	golf	 ball 	 s 	 	,	and	you	just	throw	them	in	your	 bath 	 ing 	 	suit	 trunk 	 s 	 	and	when	you	're	 d 	 one 	 	you	've	got	a	couple	hundred	of	them	.
but	the	problem	is	that	people	all	did	n't	want	all	the	golf	 ball 	 s 	 	.
so	i	just	 package 	 d 	 	them	.	i	'm	like	12	,	right	?
i	 package 	 d 	 	them	up	three	ways	.
i	had	the	 pinnacle 	 s 	 	and	ddhs	and	the	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	 one 	 s 	 	back	then	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 old 	 	for	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	each	.
and	then	i	had	all	the	good	 one 	 s 	 	that	did	n't	look	 crap 	 py 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	50	 cent 	 s 	 	each	.
and	then	i	'd	sell	50	at	a	time	of	all	the	 crap 	 py 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	they	could	use	 t 	 hose 	 	for	practice	 ball 	 s 	 	.
i	 s 	 old 	 	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	,	when	i	was	in	school	,	to	all	the	 kid 	 s 	 	in	high	school	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 get 	 s 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 hat 	 ing 	 	you	is	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	money	from	all	your	 friend 	 s 	 	all	the	time	.
but	it	paid	the	 bill 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 old 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	.
then	when	the	school	shut	me	down	--	the	school	 actual 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 	and	told	me	i	could	n't	do	it	--	so	i	went	to	the	gas	 station 	 s 	 	and	i	 s 	 old 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	them	to	the	gas	 station 	 s 	 	and	had	the	gas	 station 	 s 	 	sell	them	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
that	was	cool	 be 	 cause 	 	then	i	had	 re 	 tail 	 	 out 	 lets 	 	.
and	i	think	i	was	14	.
then	i	paid	my	entire	way	through	first	year	university	at	carlton	by	selling	wine	 skin 	 s 	 	door	to	door	.
you	know	that	you	can	hold	a	40	-	ounce	bottle	of	rum	and	two	 bottle 	 s 	 	of	 co 	 ke 	 	in	a	 wine 	 skin 	 	?	so	what	,	right	?
 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	you	know	what	?	you	stuff	that	down	your	 short 	 s 	 	,	when	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	game	you	can	get	 boo 	 ze 	 	in	for	free	,	 every 	 body 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	them	.
supply	,	demand	,	big	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 brand 	 ed 	 	it	,	so	i	 s 	 old 	 	them	for	five	 time 	 s 	 	the	normal	cost	.
it	had	our	university	logo	on	it	.
you	know	we	teach	our	 kid 	 s 	 	and	we	buy	them	 game 	 s 	 	,	but	why	do	n't	we	get	them	 game 	 s 	 	,	if	they	're	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	that	kind	of	nurture	the	 trait 	 s 	 	that	you	need	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	?
why	do	n't	you	teach	them	not	to	waste	money	?
i	remember	 be 	 ing 	 	told	to	walk	out	in	the	middle	of	a	street	in	banff	,	alberta	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'd	 throw 	 n 	 	a	 pen 	 ny 	 	out	in	the	street	,	and	my	dad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	go	pick	it	up	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	work	too	damn	hard	for	my	money	.	i	'm	not	going	to	see	you	ever	waste	a	 pen 	 ny 	 	.	``
and	i	remember	that	 less 	 on 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	.
 allow 	 ance 	 s 	 	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	the	wrong	 habit 	 s 	 	.
 allow 	 ance 	 s 	 	,	by	nature	,	are	 teach 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	think	about	a	job	.
an	entrepreneur	 do 	 es 	 	n't	expect	a	regular	 pay 	 check 	 	.
 allow 	 ance 	 	is	 breed 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	at	a	young	age	to	expect	a	regular	 pay 	 check 	 	.
that	's	wrong	,	for	me	,	if	you	want	to	raise	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
what	i	do	with	my	 kid 	 s 	 	now	--	i	've	got	two	,	nine	and	seven	--	is	i	teach	them	to	walk	around	the	house	and	the	yard	,	looking	for	stuff	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	get	 d 	 one 	 	.
come	to	me	and	tell	me	what	it	is	.
or	i	'll	come	to	them	and	say	,	``	here	's	what	i	need	 d 	 one 	 	.	``
and	then	you	know	what	we	do	?	we	 negoti 	 ate 	 	.
they	go	around	looking	for	what	it	is	.
but	then	we	 negoti 	 ate 	 	on	what	they	're	going	to	get	paid	.
and	then	they	do	n't	have	a	regular	check	,	but	they	have	more	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	find	more	stuff	,	and	they	learn	the	skill	of	 negoti 	 ating 	 	,	and	they	learn	the	skill	of	 find 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
you	breed	that	kind	of	stuff	.	each	of	my	 kid 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	two	piggy	 bank 	 s 	 	.
fifty	percent	of	all	the	money	that	they	earn	or	get	 gift 	 ed 	 	,	50	percent	 go 	 es 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	house	account	,	50	percent	 go 	 es 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 to 	 y 	 	account	.
 any 	 thing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 to 	 y 	 	account	they	can	 s 	 pend 	 	on	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	.
the	50	percent	that	 go 	 es 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	house	account	,	every	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	bank	.
they	walk	up	with	me	.	every	year	all	the	money	in	the	bank	 go 	 es 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	broker	.
both	my	nine	-	and	seven	-	year	-	olds	have	a	stock	broker	 al 	 ready 	 	.
but	i	'm	 teach 	 ing 	 	them	to	force	that	 saving 	 s 	 	habit	.
it	 drive 	 s 	 	me	crazy	that	30	-	year	-	olds	are	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 may 	 be 	 	i	'll	start	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	my	rsp	now	.	``
shit	,	you	've	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	25	 year 	 s 	 	.
you	can	teach	 t 	 hose 	 	 habit 	 s 	 	to	young	 kid 	 s 	 	when	they	do	n't	even	feel	the	pain	yet	.
do	n't	read	them	 bed 	 time 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	every	night	.
 may 	 be 	 	four	 night 	 s 	 	out	of	the	week	read	them	 bed 	 time 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	and	three	 night 	 s 	 	of	the	week	have	them	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	.
why	do	n't	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	with	 kid 	 s 	 	and	give	them	four	 item 	 s 	 	,	a	red	shirt	,	a	blue	tie	,	a	kangaroo	and	a	 lap 	 top 	 	,	and	have	them	tell	a	story	about	 t 	 hose 	 	four	 thing 	 s 	 	?
my	 kid 	 s 	 	do	that	all	the	time	.
it	 teach 	 es 	 	them	to	sell	;	it	 teach 	 es 	 	them	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	;	it	 teach 	 es 	 	them	to	think	on	 the 	 ir 	 	feet	.
just	do	that	kind	of	stuff	and	have	 f 	 un 	 	with	it	.
get	 kid 	 s 	 	to	stand	up	in	front	of	 group 	 s 	 	and	talk	,	even	if	it	's	just	stand	up	in	front	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	and	do	 play 	 s 	 	and	have	 speech 	 es 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	that	you	want	to	be	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	.
show	the	 kid 	 s 	 	what	bad	 custom 	 ers 	 	or	bad	 employ 	 ees 	 	look	like	.
show	them	the	 grum 	 py 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	.
when	you	see	 grum 	 py 	 	 custom 	 er 	 	service	,	point	that	out	to	them	.
say	,	``	by	the	way	,	that	guy	's	a	 crap 	 py 	 	 employ 	 ee 	 	.	``
and	say	,	``	these	 one 	 s 	 	are	good	 one 	 s 	 	.	``
if	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	restaurant	and	you	have	bad	 custom 	 er 	 	service	,	show	them	what	bad	 custom 	 er 	 	service	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
we	have	all	these	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	in	front	of	us	,	but	we	do	n't	take	 t 	 hose 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	;	we	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	to	go	get	a	tutor	.
imagine	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	all	the	 kid 	 s 	 	'	junk	that	's	in	the	house	right	now	,	all	the	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	that	they	've	 out 	 grown 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	we	start	selling	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	on	craigslist	and	kijiji	?	``
and	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	sell	it	and	learn	how	to	find	 scammer 	 s 	 	when	they	get	email	 off 	 ers 	 	come	in	.
they	can	come	 in 	 to 	 	your	account	or	a	sub	account	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
but	teach	them	how	to	fix	the	price	,	guess	the	price	,	pull	up	the	 photo 	 s 	 	.
teach	them	how	to	do	that	kind	of	stuff	and	make	money	.
then	the	money	they	get	,	50	percent	 go 	 es 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	house	account	,	50	percent	 go 	 es 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 to 	 y 	 	account	.
my	 kid 	 s 	 	love	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
some	of	the	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	that	you	've	got	to	nurture	in	 kid 	 s 	 	:	 attain 	 ment 	 	,	 ten 	 a 	 city 	 	,	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 intro 	 spect 	 ion 	 	,	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	 value 	 s 	 	.
all	these	 trait 	 s 	 	you	can	find	in	young	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	help	nurture	them	.
look	for	that	kind	of	stuff	.
there	's	two	 trait 	 s 	 	that	i	want	you	to	 al 	 so 	 	look	out	for	that	we	do	n't	kind	of	get	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	system	.
do	n't	 medic 	 ate 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	for	attention	 defici 	 t 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	 un 	 less 	 	it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 freak 	 ing 	 	bad	.
the	same	with	the	whole	 thing 	 s 	 	on	mania	and	stress	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	 un 	 less 	 	it	is	so	 clinic 	 ally 	 	brutal	,	man	.
 bi 	 polar 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	is	 nick 	 named 	 	the	ceo	disease	.
when	steve	jurvetson	and	jim	clark	and	jim	barksdale	have	all	got	it	,	and	they	built	netscape	--	imagine	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	ritalin	.
we	would	n't	have	have	that	stuff	,	right	?
al	gore	 re 	 ally 	 	would	have	had	to	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
these	 skill 	 s 	 	are	the	 skill 	 s 	 	we	should	be	 teach 	 ing 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	do	n't	get	 kid 	 s 	 	to	want	to	be	 lawyer 	 s 	 	.
but	how	about	 get 	 ting 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	to	be	 rank 	 ed 	 	right	up	there	with	the	rest	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	well	?
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	that	.
i	want	to	close	with	a	quick	little	video	.
it	's	a	video	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	one	of	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	i	mentor	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	 grass 	 hopper 	 	.
