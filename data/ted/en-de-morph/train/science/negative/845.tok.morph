most	of	the	 talk 	 s 	 	that	you	've	heard	in	the	last	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	fabulous	 day 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	from	people	who	have	the	 character 	 istic 	 	that	they	have	thought	about	 some 	 thing 	 	,	they	are	 expert 	 s 	 	,	they	know	what	's	going	on	.
all	of	you	know	about	the	 top 	 ic 	 	that	i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	talk	about	.
that	is	,	you	know	what	 simpl 	 icity 	 	is	,	you	know	what	 complex 	 ity 	 	is	.
the	trouble	is	,	i	do	n't	.
and	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	share	with	you	my	 ignor 	 ance 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	subject	.
i	want	you	to	read	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	come	back	to	it	in	a	moment	.
the	quote	is	from	the	 fab 	 led 	 	potter	stewart	opinion	on	 porn 	 ography 	 	.
and	let	me	just	read	it	,	the	 import 	 ant 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	here	:	``	 short 	 hand 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	,	[	'	 hard 	 core 	 	 porn 	 ography 	 	'	]	;	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	i	could	never	succeed	in	 intellig 	 ibly 	 	 defi 	 ning 	 	it	.
but	i	know	it	when	i	see	it	.	``
i	'm	going	to	come	back	to	that	in	a	moment	.
so	,	what	is	 simpl 	 icity 	 	?
it	's	good	to	start	with	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
a	coffee	cup	--	we	do	n't	think	about	coffee	 cup 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	much	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	than	one	might	think	--	a	coffee	cup	is	a	 de 	 vice 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 contain 	 er 	 	and	a	handle	.
the	handle	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	you	to	hold	it	when	the	 contain 	 er 	 	is	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	hot	liquid	.
why	is	that	 import 	 ant 	 	?
well	,	it	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	you	to	drink	coffee	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	by	the	way	,	the	coffee	is	hot	,	the	liquid	is	 steril 	 e 	 	;	you	're	not	 like 	 ly 	 	to	get	cholera	that	way	.
so	the	coffee	cup	,	or	the	cup	with	a	handle	,	is	one	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	used	by	 socie 	 ty 	 	to	maintain	public	health	.
 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	are	your	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	 glass 	 es 	 	 en 	 able 	 	you	to	see	 thing 	 s 	 	and	keep	you	from	 be 	 ing 	 	eaten	by	 cheetah 	 s 	 	or	run	down	by	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	,	and	 book 	 s 	 	are	,	after	all	,	your	education	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	class	of	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
simple	in	function	,	but	not	at	all	simple	in	how	they	're	 construct 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	two	here	are	just	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
one	is	the	 cell 	 phone 	 	,	which	we	use	every	day	.
and	it	 rest 	 s 	 	on	a	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	 t 	 hose 	 	that	my	friend	benoit	mandelbrot	 discuss 	 ed 	 	,	but	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	other	,	of	course	,	is	a	birth	control	pill	,	which	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	way	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	structure	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	by	changing	the	role	of	women	in	it	by	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	to	them	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	 re 	 productive 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	.
so	,	there	are	two	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	word	,	i	think	.
and	here	i	've	 corrupt 	 ed 	 	the	potter	stewart	 quota 	 tion 	 	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	can	think	about	 some 	 thing 	 	--	which	 span 	 s 	 	all	the	way	from	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	to	the	cell	phone	,	 inter 	 net 	 	and	birth	control	 pill 	 s 	 	--	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	they	're	simple	,	the	 function 	 s 	 	are	simple	,	and	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	what	that	 simpl 	 icity 	 	is	when	we	see	it	.
or	there	may	be	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	which	is	to	think	about	the	problem	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	what	--	if	you	associate	with	moral	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	--	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	teapot	problem	.
the	teapot	problem	i	'll	pose	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
suppose	you	see	a	teapot	,	and	the	teapot	is	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	hot	water	.
and	you	then	ask	the	question	:	why	is	the	water	hot	?
and	that	's	a	simple	question	.
it	's	like	,	what	is	 simpl 	 icity 	 	?
one	answer	would	be	:	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 kine 	 tic 	 	energy	of	the	water	 molecule 	 s 	 	is	high	and	they	 bounc 	 e 	 	against	 thing 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	--	that	's	a	kind	of	physical	science	argument	.
a	second	argument	would	be	:	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	stove	with	the	flame	on	--	that	's	an	 historic 	 al 	 	argument	.
a	third	is	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	hot	water	for	tea	--	that	's	an	intentional	argument	.
and	,	since	 th 	 is 	 	is	coming	from	a	moral	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	the	fourth	would	be	that	it	's	part	of	god	's	plan	for	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
all	of	these	are	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
the	point	is	that	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	trouble	when	you	ask	a	single	question	with	a	single	box	for	an	answer	,	in	which	that	single	question	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	 man 	 y 	 	 question 	 s 	 	with	 quit 	 e 	 	different	 meaning 	 s 	 	,	but	with	the	same	 word 	 s 	 	.
 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	is	 simpl 	 icity 	 	?	``	i	think	 fall 	 s 	 	in	that	 categor 	 y 	 	.
what	is	the	state	of	science	?
and	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 complex 	 ity 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
we	have	a	lot	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	information	about	what	 complex 	 ity 	 	is	.
 simpl 	 icity 	 	,	for	 reason 	 s 	 	that	are	a	little	bit	 obscur 	 e 	 	,	is	 al 	 most 	 	not	 pursue 	 d 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	academic	world	.
we	 academic 	 s 	 	--	i	am	an	academic	--	we	love	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
you	can	write	 paper 	 s 	 	about	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	and	the	nice	thing	about	 complex 	 ity 	 	is	it	's	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	intractable	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	so	you	're	not	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
 simpl 	 icity 	 	--	all	of	you	 re 	 ally 	 	would	like	your	waring	 blend 	 er 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	to	make	 what 	 ever 	 	a	waring	 blend 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	but	not	explode	or	play	beethoven	.
you	're	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	what	one	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	do	with	the	 reward 	 s 	 	of	the	system	.
and	there	's	a	lot	of	 reward 	 s 	 	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	emergence	,	not	so	much	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	want	to	do	is	to	help	you	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	task	--	which	you	may	not	know	that	you	have	 ver 	 y 	 	often	--	which	is	to	understand	how	to	 s 	 it 	 	next	to	a	physicist	at	a	 d 	 inner 	 	party	and	have	a	conversation	.
and	the	 word 	 s 	 	that	i	would	like	you	to	focus	on	are	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	emergence	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	will	 en 	 able 	 	you	to	start	the	conversation	and	then	 day 	 dream 	 	about	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
all	right	,	what	is	 complex 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	view	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	what	is	emergence	?
we	have	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 work 	 ing 	 	definition	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
it	is	a	system	,	like	traffic	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 component 	 s 	 	.
the	 component 	 s 	 	interact	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
these	are	 car 	 s 	 	and	 driver 	 s 	 	.	they	dissipate	energy	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	,	 when 	 ever 	 	you	have	that	system	,	weird	stuff	 happen 	 s 	 	,	and	you	in	los	angeles	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	better	than	 any 	 one 	 	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	i	put	up	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	current	science	.
you	ca	n't	possibly	read	that	.	it	's	not	 intend 	 ed 	 	that	you	read	it	,	but	that	's	a	 tin 	 y 	 	part	of	the	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	going	on	in	each	of	your	 cell 	 s 	 	at	any	 give 	 n 	 	moment	.
and	it	's	like	the	traffic	that	you	see	.
the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	about	the	cell	is	that	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	maintain	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 s 	 table 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	relationship	with	other	 cell 	 s 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	know	why	.
 any 	 one 	 	who	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	we	understand	life	,	and	let	me	 reduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	level	.
we	've	heard	from	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
all	of	us	,	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	a	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	.
 terr 	 ific 	 	.	you	learn	 every 	 thing 	 	you	can	about	that	.
and	then	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	thing	that	you	might	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	you	 stud 	 y 	 	that	hard	.
that	's	a	bono	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bono	.
but	then	,	if	you	know	 every 	 thing 	 	you	can	know	about	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	you	put	them	together	,	what	can	you	say	about	 th 	 is 	 	combination	?
the	answer	is	,	not	a	lot	.
and	that	's	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
now	,	imagine	building	that	up	to	a	city	,	or	to	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	and	you	've	got	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	problem	.
all	right	,	so	let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	of	a	 part 	 icular 	 	kind	.
and	i	want	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	a	word	that	i	think	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	,	which	is	 stack 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	use	 stack 	 ing 	 	for	a	kind	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 character 	 istic 	 	that	it	is	so	simple	and	so	 reli 	 able 	 	that	i	can	build	 thing 	 s 	 	with	it	.
or	i	'm	going	to	use	simple	to	mean	 reli 	 able 	 	,	 predict 	 able 	 	,	 repeat 	 able 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	use	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 stack 	 ed 	 	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
we	call	it	a	complex	system	,	which	it	is	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
the	 inter 	 net 	 	 start 	 s 	 	with	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	with	 bin 	 ary 	 	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	list	of	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	bottom	,	we	are	familiar	with	the	arabic	 number 	 s 	 	one	to	10	and	so	on	.
in	 bin 	 ary 	 	,	one	is	0001	,	seven	is	0111	.
the	question	is	:	why	is	 bin 	 ary 	 	 simpl 	 er 	 	than	arabic	?
and	the	answer	is	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	that	if	i	hold	up	three	 finger 	 s 	 	,	you	can	count	that	 eas 	 ily 	 	,	but	if	i	hold	up	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	sort	of	hard	to	say	that	i	just	did	seven	.
the	virtue	of	 bin 	 ary 	 	is	that	it	's	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	possible	way	of	 represent 	 ing 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 thing 	 	else	is	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
you	can	catch	 error 	 s 	 	with	it	,	it	's	 un 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	,	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	good	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 bin 	 ary 	 	.
so	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	once	you	learn	how	to	read	it	.
now	,	if	you	like	to	represent	 th 	 is 	 	zero	and	one	of	 bin 	 ary 	 	,	you	need	a	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	think	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	your	life	that	are	 bin 	 ary 	 	,	one	of	them	is	light	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	.
they	can	be	on	and	off	.	that	's	 bin 	 ary 	 	.
now	wall	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	,	we	all	know	,	fail	.
but	our	 friend 	 s 	 	who	are	 condens 	 ed 	 	matter	 physicist 	 s 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	to	come	up	,	some	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	 de 	 vice 	 	,	 show 	 n 	 	under	that	bell	jar	,	which	is	a	transistor	.
a	transistor	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	a	wall	 s 	 witch 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	and	off	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	so	 with 	 out 	 	moving	 part 	 s 	 	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	fail	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	period	of	time	.
so	the	second	layer	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	was	the	transistor	in	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
so	,	since	the	transistor	is	so	simple	,	you	can	put	 lot 	 s 	 	of	them	together	.
and	you	put	 lot 	 s 	 	of	them	together	and	you	come	with	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 integrate 	 d 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	.
and	a	current	 integrate 	 d 	 	circuit	might	have	in	each	one	of	these	 chip 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	billion	 transistor 	 s 	 	,	all	of	which	have	to	work	 perfect 	 ly 	 	every	time	.
so	that	's	the	next	layer	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	,	and	,	in	fact	,	 integrate 	 d 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	in	the	sense	that	they	,	in	general	,	work	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
with	 integrate 	 d 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	,	you	can	build	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	.
you	all	are	 ac 	 custom 	 ed 	 	to	 hav 	 ing 	 	your	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	work	the	large	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	time	.
in	boston	...	boston	is	a	little	bit	like	namibia	in	 it 	 s 	 	cell	phone	 cover 	 age 	 	,	so	that	we	're	not	 ac 	 custom 	 ed 	 	to	that	all	the	time	,	but	some	of	the	time	.
but	,	in	fact	,	if	you	have	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	,	you	can	now	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	nice	 lad 	 y 	 	who	's	 some 	 where 	 	like	namibia	,	and	who	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	happy	with	the	fact	that	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	she	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	an	master	's	degree	in	 electric 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	from	mit	,	she	's	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	able	to	hack	her	cell	phone	to	get	power	in	some	funny	way	.
and	from	that	 come 	 s 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	of	 bit 	 flow 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	continent	.
the	two	 blob 	 s 	 	that	are	light	in	the	middle	there	are	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	europe	.
and	then	back	to	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	here	we	have	what	i	think	is	one	of	the	great	 idea 	 s 	 	,	which	is	google	.
which	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	simple	 port 	 al 	 	 make 	 s 	 	the	claim	that	it	 make 	 s 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	all	of	the	world	's	information	.
but	the	point	is	that	that	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	simple	idea	 rest 	 s 	 	on	 layer 	 s 	 	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	each	 com 	 pound 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 complex 	 ity 	 	that	is	 it 	 self 	 	simple	,	in	the	sense	that	it	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 reli 	 able 	 	.
all	right	,	let	me	then	finish	off	with	four	general	 state 	 ments 	 	,	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	and	two	 aphorism 	 s 	 	.
the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	,	which	i	think	are	 use 	 ful 	 	to	think	about	for	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	:	first	,	they	are	 predict 	 able 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	is	 predict 	 able 	 	.
now	,	one	of	the	nice	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	is	you	know	what	it	's	going	to	do	,	in	general	.
so	 simpl 	 icity 	 	and	 predict 	 ability 	 	are	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	second	is	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	world	 state 	 ment 	 	,	they	're	cheap	.
if	you	have	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	cheap	 en 	 ough 	 	,	people	will	find	uses	for	them	,	even	if	they	seem	 ver 	 y 	 	primitive	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 stone 	 s 	 	.
you	can	build	 cat 	 hedral 	 s 	 	out	of	 stone 	 s 	 	,	you	just	have	to	know	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
you	carve	them	in	 block 	 s 	 	and	then	you	pile	them	on	top	of	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	they	support	weight	.
so	there	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	function	,	the	function	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 predict 	 able 	 	and	the	cost	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	low	.
what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	you	have	to	have	a	high	performance	or	value	for	cost	.
and	then	i	would	 pro 	 pose 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	last	component	that	they	serve	,	or	have	the	potential	to	serve	,	 a 	 s 	 	building	 block 	 s 	 	.
that	is	,	you	can	stack	them	.
and	stack	can	mean	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	or	it	can	mean	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	or	it	can	mean	in	some	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	n	-	dimensional	space	.
but	if	you	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	function	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cheap	,	people	will	find	new	ways	of	 put 	 ting 	 	it	together	to	make	new	 thing 	 s 	 	.
cheap	,	functional	,	 reli 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	unleash	the	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	of	people	who	then	build	stuff	that	you	could	not	imagine	.
there	's	no	way	of	 predict 	 ing 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	based	on	the	first	transistor	.
it	just	is	not	possible	.
so	these	are	the	 component 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	want	to	give	you	from	the	work	that	we	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	do	.
we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 deliver 	 ing 	 	health	care	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	wish	to	do	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	business	is	to	find	a	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	medical	 diagnos 	 is 	 	at	 a 	 s 	 	close	to	zero	cost	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	manage	.
so	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	one	do	that	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	world	in	which	there	's	no	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	there	's	no	money	,	there	's	no	medical	 compete 	 nce 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	your	time	in	going	through	the	 detail 	 s 	 	,	but	in	the	lower	right	-	hand	corner	,	you	see	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	kind	of	thing	that	we	have	.
it	's	a	little	paper	chip	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	 print 	 ed 	 	on	it	using	the	same	technology	that	you	use	for	making	 com 	 ic 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	which	was	the	inspiration	for	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	idea	.
and	you	put	a	drop	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	of	 urin 	 e 	 	at	the	bottom	.
it	 wick 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	way	up	 in 	 to 	 	these	little	 branch 	 es 	 	.
you	know	,	no	power	 requir 	 ed 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	 color 	 s 	 	.	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	case	,	you	're	 read 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 ney 	 	function	.
and	,	since	the	health	care	 work 	 er 	 	of	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	is	an	18	year	-	old	with	an	ak	-	47	,	who	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	out	of	work	and	is	 will 	 ing 	 	to	go	around	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	,	he	can	take	a	picture	of	it	with	his	 cell 	 phone 	 	,	 s 	 end 	 	the	picture	back	to	where	there	is	a	doctor	,	and	the	doctor	can	look	at	it	.
so	what	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	to	take	a	technology	,	which	is	 avail 	 able 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	make	a	 de 	 vice 	 	,	which	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	cheap	,	and	make	it	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	fashion	that	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 reli 	 able 	 	.
if	we	can	pull	 th 	 is 	 	off	,	if	we	can	build	more	function	,	it	will	be	 stack 	 able 	 	.
that	is	to	say	,	if	we	can	make	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	technology	of	one	or	two	 thing 	 s 	 	work	,	it	will	be	 appli 	 cable 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	human	 condition 	 s 	 	,	and	 h 	 ence 	 	,	 extend 	 able 	 	in	both	 vert 	 ical 	 	and	 horizon 	 tal 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	.
part	of	my	interest	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	have	to	say	,	is	that	i	would	like	to	--	how	do	i	put	 th 	 is 	 	 polite 	 ly 	 	?	--	change	the	way	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	eviscerate	,	the	capital	structure	of	the	u.s.	health	care	system	,	which	i	think	is	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	broken	.
so	,	let	me	close	--	let	me	close	with	my	two	 aphorism 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	is	from	mr.	einstein	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 every 	 thing 	 	should	be	made	 a 	 s 	 	simple	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	but	not	 simpl 	 er 	 	.	``
and	i	think	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	problem	.
if	you	take	too	much	out	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	simple	,	you	lose	function	.
you	have	to	have	low	cost	,	but	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	have	a	function	.
so	you	ca	n't	make	it	too	simple	.
and	the	second	is	a	design	issue	,	and	it	's	not	 direct 	 ly 	 	relevant	,	but	it	's	a	nice	 state 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	by	de	saint	-	exupery	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	know	you	've	 achiev 	 ed 	 	 perfect 	 ion 	 	in	design	,	not	when	you	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	to	add	,	but	when	you	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	to	take	away	.	``
and	that	 certain 	 ly 	 	is	going	in	the	right	direction	.
so	,	what	i	think	one	can	begin	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	cut	at	the	word	 simpl 	 icity 	 	,	which	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cover	brancusi	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	answer	the	question	of	why	mondrian	is	better	or	 wo 	 rse 	 	or	 simpl 	 er 	 	or	less	 simpl 	 er 	 	than	van	gogh	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	address	the	question	of	 whet 	 her 	 	mozart	is	 simpl 	 er 	 	than	bach	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	make	a	point	--	which	is	one	which	,	in	a	sense	,	 different 	 iate 	 s 	 	the	real	world	of	people	who	make	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	the	world	of	people	who	think	about	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	is	,	there	is	an	intellectual	merit	to	 ask 	 ing 	 	:	how	do	we	make	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	simple	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	,	 a 	 s 	 	cheap	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	,	 a 	 s 	 	functional	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	and	 a 	 s 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	 interconnect 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	?
if	we	make	that	kind	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	in	our	technology	and	then	give	it	to	you	 guy 	 s 	 	,	you	can	go	off	and	do	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	fabulous	 thing 	 s 	 	with	it	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	quick	question	.
so	can	you	picture	that	a	science	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	might	get	to	the	point	where	you	could	look	out	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 system 	 s 	 	--	say	a	financial	system	or	a	legal	system	,	health	system	--	and	say	,	``	that	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	the	point	of	danger	or	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 ity 	 	for	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	might	 simpl 	 ify 	 	it	``	?
george	whitesides	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	think	you	could	.	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	look	at	the	 component 	 s 	 	from	which	the	system	is	made	and	examine	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 rag 	 ility 	 	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ability 	 	,	you	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	build	a	kind	of	risk	 assess 	 ment 	 	based	on	that	 bas 	 is 	 	.
ca	:	have	you	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	that	?
i	mean	,	with	the	health	system	,	you	got	a	sort	of	radical	solution	on	the	cost	side	,	but	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	system	 it 	 self 	 	?
gw	:	well	,	no	.
how	do	i	put	that	 simpl 	 y 	 	?	no	.
ca	:	that	was	a	simple	,	 power 	 ful 	 	answer	.	gw	:	 y 	 es 	 	.
ca	:	so	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	that	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	technology	that	you	've	got	,	where	is	that	,	and	when	do	you	see	that	 may 	 be 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 roll 	 ed 	 	out	to	scale	.
gw	:	that	's	coming	out	soon	.	i	mean	,	the	 system 	 s 	 	work	,	and	we	have	to	find	out	how	to	 manufactur 	 e 	 	them	and	do	 thing 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	,	but	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	technology	 work 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	you	've	got	a	company	set	up	to	...
gw	:	a	 found 	 ation 	 	,	a	 found 	 ation 	 	.	not	-	for	-	profit	.
ca	:	all	right	.	well	,	thank	you	so	much	for	your	talk	.	thank	you	.
