i	 re 	 ally 	 	am	 honor 	 ed 	 	to	be	here	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	chris	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	over	20	 year 	 s 	 	since	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	africa	.
my	first	 introduc 	 tion 	 	was	at	the	abidjan	 air 	 port 	 	on	a	 sweat 	 y 	 	,	 iv 	 ory 	 	coast	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
i	had	just	left	wall	street	,	cut	my	hair	to	look	like	margaret	mead	,	 give 	 n 	 	away	most	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	owned	,	and	 arriv 	 ed 	 	with	all	the	 essential 	 s 	 	--	some	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	a	few	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	and	,	of	course	,	a	guitar	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	,	and	i	thought	i	would	just	start	with	the	african	continent	.
but	 liter 	 ally 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 day 	 s 	 	of	 arriv 	 ing 	 	i	was	told	,	in	no	 un 	 certain 	 	 term 	 s 	 	,	by	a	number	of	west	african	women	,	that	africans	did	n't	want	saving	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	 l 	 east 	 	of	all	not	by	me	.
i	was	too	young	,	 un 	 married 	 	,	i	had	no	children	,	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	africa	,	and	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	,	my	french	was	 pit 	 iful 	 	.
and	so	,	it	was	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	time	in	my	life	,	and	yet	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	give	me	the	 humil 	 ity 	 	to	start	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
i	think	that	failure	can	be	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 motiv 	 ating 	 	force	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	so	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	kenya	and	 work 	 ed 	 	in	uganda	,	and	i	met	a	group	of	rwandan	women	,	who	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	in	1986	,	to	move	to	kigali	to	help	them	start	the	first	 micro 	 finance 	 	institution	there	.
and	i	did	,	and	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 na 	 ming 	 	it	duterimbere	,	meaning	``	to	go	forward	with	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	.	``	and	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	n't	a	lot	of	 business 	 es 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 vi 	 able 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	by	women	,	and	so	 may 	 be 	 	i	should	try	to	run	a	business	,	too	.
and	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	around	,	and	i	heard	about	a	 bake 	 ry 	 	that	was	run	by	20	 prostitute 	 s 	 	.
and	,	 be 	 ing 	 	a	little	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	,	i	went	to	go	meet	 th 	 is 	 	group	,	and	what	i	found	was	20	 un 	 wed 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	my	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	power	of	language	,	and	how	what	we	call	people	so	often	 distance 	 s 	 	us	from	them	,	and	 make 	 s 	 	them	little	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	found	out	that	the	 bake 	 ry 	 	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	a	business	,	that	,	in	fact	,	it	was	a	classic	 char 	 ity 	 	run	by	a	well	-	intentioned	person	,	who	 essential 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	600	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	to	keep	these	20	women	 bus 	 y 	 	making	little	 craft 	 s 	 	and	 bake 	 d 	 	 good 	 s 	 	,	and	living	on	50	 cent 	 s 	 	a	day	,	still	in	poverty	.
so	,	i	made	a	deal	with	the	women	.	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	we	get	rid	of	the	 char 	 ity 	 	side	,	and	we	run	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	business	and	i	'll	help	you	.	``
they	 nervous 	 ly 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	.	i	 nervous 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	,	of	course	,	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	than	you	think	they	're	going	to	be	.
first	of	all	,	i	thought	,	well	,	we	need	a	 sale 	 s 	 	team	,	and	we	 clear 	 ly 	 	are	n't	the	a	-	team	here	,	so	let	's	--	i	did	all	 th 	 is 	 	training	.
and	the	 epit 	 ome 	 	was	when	i	 liter 	 ally 	 	 march 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	nyamirambo	,	which	is	the	popular	quarter	of	kigali	,	with	a	 buck 	 et 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 old 	 	all	these	little	 dough 	 nuts 	 	to	people	,	and	i	came	back	,	and	i	was	like	,	``	you	see	?	``
and	the	women	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	jacqueline	,	who	in	nyamirambo	is	not	going	to	buy	 dough 	 nuts 	 	out	of	an	 o 	 range 	 	 buck 	 et 	 	from	a	tall	american	woman	?	``	and	like	--	--	it	's	a	good	point	.
so	then	i	went	the	whole	american	way	,	with	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	,	team	and	individual	.	 complete 	 ly 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	,	but	over	time	,	the	women	 learn 	 t 	 	to	sell	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	way	.
and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 market 	 place 	 	,	and	they	came	back	with	 idea 	 s 	 	for	 cass 	 a 	 va 	 	 chip 	 s 	 	,	and	banana	 chip 	 s 	 	,	and	 s 	 org 	 hum 	 	bread	,	and	before	you	 k 	 new 	 	it	,	we	had	 corner 	 ed 	 	the	kigali	market	,	and	the	women	 we 	 re 	 	 earn 	 ing 	 	three	to	four	 time 	 s 	 	the	national	average	.
and	with	that	confidence	 s 	 urge 	 	,	i	thought	,	``	well	,	it	's	time	to	create	a	real	 bake 	 ry 	 	,	so	let	's	paint	it	.	``	and	the	women	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	idea	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	color	do	you	want	to	paint	it	?	``	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	 choos 	 e 	 	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	i	'm	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	listen	.
you	 choos 	 e 	 	.	it	's	your	 bake 	 ry 	 	,	your	street	,	your	country	--	not	mine	.	``
but	they	would	n't	give	me	an	answer	.
so	,	one	week	,	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	three	 week 	 s 	 	went	by	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	how	about	blue	?	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	blue	,	blue	,	we	love	blue	.	let	's	do	it	blue	.	``
so	,	i	went	to	the	store	,	i	 br 	 ought 	 	gaudence	,	the	 recalcit 	 rant 	 	one	of	all	,	and	we	 br 	 ought 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	paint	and	fabric	to	make	 cur 	 tain 	 s 	 	,	and	on	 paint 	 ing 	 	day	,	we	all	 gather 	 ed 	 	in	nyamirambo	,	and	the	idea	was	we	would	paint	it	white	with	blue	 a 	 s 	 	trim	,	like	a	little	french	 bake 	 ry 	 	.	but	that	was	 clear 	 ly 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	a	wall	of	blue	like	a	 morn 	 ing 	 	sky	.
so	,	blue	,	blue	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 be 	 came 	 	blue	.
the	 wall 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	blue	,	the	 window 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	blue	,	the	 side 	 walk 	 	out	front	was	 paint 	 ed 	 	blue	.
and	aretha	franklin	was	 shout 	 ing 	 	``	r	-	e	-	s	-	p	-	e	-	c	-	t	,	``	the	women	's	 hip 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 way 	 ing 	 	and	little	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	grab	the	 paint 	 brush 	 es 	 	,	but	it	was	 the 	 ir 	 	day	.
and	at	the	end	of	it	,	we	stood	 a 	 cross 	 	the	street	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	we	had	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	is	so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.	``
and	the	women	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	i	think	the	color	is	perfect	,	``	and	they	all	 nod 	 d 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	head	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	gaudence	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	it	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	,	but	,	you	know	,	our	color	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	it	is	green	.	``	and	--	--	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	then	that	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	n't	just	about	patience	,	but	that	when	you	've	lived	on	 char 	 ity 	 	and	dependent	your	whole	life	long	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	say	what	you	mean	.
and	,	 most 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	never	 re 	 ally 	 	ask	you	,	and	when	they	do	,	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	they	want	to	know	the	truth	.
and	so	then	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	about	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	better	to	ask	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	i	lived	in	kigali	for	about	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	it	was	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	time	in	my	life	.
and	it	taught	me	three	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	that	i	think	are	so	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	the	work	that	i	do	.
the	first	is	that	dignity	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	human	spirit	than	wealth	.
 a 	 s 	 	eleni	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	when	people	gain	income	,	they	gain	choice	,	and	that	is	fundamental	to	dignity	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	see	each	other	,	and	we	want	to	be	heard	by	each	other	,	and	we	should	never	forget	that	.
the	second	is	that	 tradition 	 al 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	and	aid	are	never	going	to	solve	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	poverty	.
i	think	andrew	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	 cover 	 ed 	 	that	,	so	i	will	move	to	the	third	point	,	which	is	that	 market 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	 al 	 so 	 	are	not	going	to	solve	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	poverty	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	we	ran	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	business	,	but	 some 	 one 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	pay	the	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	support	that	came	 in 	 to 	 	the	training	,	and	the	management	support	,	the	 strat 	 egic 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	and	,	 may 	 be 	 	most	 import 	 ant 	 	of	all	,	the	access	to	new	 contact 	 s 	 	,	 network 	 s 	 	and	new	 market 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	on	a	micro	level	,	there	's	a	real	role	for	 th 	 is 	 	combination	of	 invest 	 ment 	 	and	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
and	on	a	macro	level	--	some	of	the	 speaker 	 s 	 	have	 infer 	 red 	 	that	even	health	should	be	 privat 	 ized 	 	.
but	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	had	a	father	with	heart	disease	,	and	 real 	 izing 	 	that	what	our	family	could	afford	was	not	what	he	should	have	gotten	,	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	good	friend	step	in	to	help	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	all	people	deserve	access	to	health	at	 price 	 s 	 	they	can	afford	.
i	think	the	market	can	help	us	figure	that	out	,	but	there	's	got	to	be	a	 char 	 it 	 able 	 	component	,	or	i	do	n't	think	we	're	going	to	create	the	kind	of	 socie 	 ties 	 	we	want	to	live	in	.
and	so	,	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	that	made	me	decide	to	build	acumen	fund	about	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	's	a	 non 	 profit 	 	,	venture	capital	fund	for	the	poor	,	a	few	 oxy 	 moron 	 s 	 	in	one	sentence	.
it	 essential 	 ly 	 	 raise 	 s 	 	 char 	 it 	 able 	 	 fund 	 s 	 	from	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 found 	 ations 	 	and	 corporation 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	turn	around	and	we	invest	 equ 	 ity 	 	and	 loan 	 s 	 	in	both	for	-	profit	and	 non 	 profit 	 	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	deliver	 afford 	 able 	 	health	,	housing	,	energy	,	clean	water	to	low	income	people	in	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	africa	,	so	that	they	can	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 choice 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 invest 	 ed 	 	about	20	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	20	different	 enterprise 	 s 	 	,	and	have	,	in	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 create 	 d 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	20,000	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 service 	 s 	 	to	people	who	 other 	 wise 	 	would	not	be	able	to	afford	them	.
i	want	to	tell	you	two	 st 	 ories 	 	.	both	of	them	are	in	africa	.
both	of	them	are	about	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	who	are	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	service	,	and	who	 re 	 ally 	 	know	the	 market 	 s 	 	.
both	of	them	live	at	the	 con 	 flu 	 ence 	 	of	public	health	and	enterprise	,	and	both	of	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	,	create	 job 	 s 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	and	create	 income 	 s 	 	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	in	the	malaria	sector	,	and	africa	 lose 	 s 	 	about	13	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	 be 	 cause 	 	of	malaria	.
and	so	 a 	 s 	 	people	get	 health 	 ier 	 	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	get	 wealth 	 ier 	 	.
the	first	one	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	bio	-	 ex 	 tract 	 s 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	a	company	built	in	kenya	about	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	by	an	 in 	 credible 	 	entrepreneur	named	patrick	henfrey	and	his	three	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
these	are	old	-	hand	 farm 	 ers 	 	who	've	gone	through	all	the	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 up 	 s 	 	and	 down 	 s 	 	in	kenya	over	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	plant	is	an	artemisia	plant	;	it	's	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	component	for	artemisinin	,	which	is	the	best	-	known	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	malaria	.
it	's	 indi 	 genous 	 	to	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	far	east	,	but	 give 	 n 	 	that	the	 pre 	 valence 	 	of	malaria	is	here	in	africa	,	patrick	and	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	 br 	 ing 	 	it	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	high	value	-	add	product	.	``
the	 farm 	 ers 	 	get	three	to	four	 time 	 s 	 	the	 yield 	 s 	 	that	they	would	with	 ma 	 ize 	 	.
and	so	,	using	patient	capital	--	money	that	they	could	raise	early	on	,	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	 be 	 low 	 	market	 return 	 s 	 	and	was	 will 	 ing 	 	to	go	the	long	haul	and	be	 combine 	 d 	 	with	management	 assist 	 ance 	 	,	 strat 	 egic 	 	 assist 	 ance 	 	--	they	've	now	 create 	 d 	 	a	company	where	they	purchase	from	7,500	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
so	that	's	about	50,000	people	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	think	some	of	you	may	have	 visit 	 ed 	 	--	these	 farm 	 ers 	 	are	 help 	 ed 	 	by	kickstart	and	technoserve	,	who	help	them	 be 	 come 	 	more	self	-	sufficient	.
they	buy	it	,	they	dry	it	and	they	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	 th 	 is 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	,	which	was	 purchase 	 d 	 	in	part	by	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	patient	capital	from	novartis	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	real	interest	in	 get 	 ting 	 	the	powder	so	that	they	can	make	coartem	.
acumen	's	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	abe	for	the	past	year	,	year	and	a	half	,	both	on	looking	at	a	new	business	plan	,	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	expansion	look	like	,	 help 	 ing 	 	with	management	support	and	 help 	 ing 	 	to	do	term	 sheet 	 s 	 	and	raise	capital	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	what	patient	capital	 me 	 ant 	 	 emotion 	 ally 	 	in	the	last	month	or	so	.	 be 	 cause 	 	the	company	was	 liter 	 ally 	 	10	 day 	 s 	 	away	from	 prov 	 ing 	 	that	the	product	they	 produce 	 d 	 	was	at	the	world	-	quality	level	 need 	 ed 	 	to	make	coartem	,	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	 big 	 gest 	 	cash	crisis	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	we	 call 	 ed 	 	all	of	the	social	 invest 	 ors 	 	we	know	.
now	,	some	of	these	same	social	 invest 	 ors 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	africa	and	understand	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	and	they	even	 help 	 ed 	 	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
and	even	when	we	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	if	abe	 go 	 es 	 	away	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	7,500	 job 	 s 	 	go	away	too	,	we	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	 bifurc 	 ation 	 	between	business	and	the	social	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	time	we	start	 think 	 ing 	 	more	 creative 	 ly 	 	about	how	they	can	be	fused	.
so	acumen	made	not	one	,	but	two	bridge	 loan 	 s 	 	,	and	the	good	news	is	they	did	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	meet	world	-	quality	 class 	 ification 	 	and	are	now	in	the	final	 stage 	 s 	 	of	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	a	20	-	million	-	dollar	round	,	to	move	it	to	the	next	level	,	and	i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	one	of	the	more	 import 	 ant 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	east	africa	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	samuel	.	he	's	a	 farm 	 er 	 	.
he	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	living	in	the	kibera	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	when	his	father	 call 	 ed 	 	him	and	told	him	about	artemisia	and	the	value	-	add	potential	.
so	he	 move 	 d 	 	back	to	the	farm	,	and	,	long	story	short	,	they	now	have	seven	 acre 	 s 	 	under	 cultiv 	 ation 	 	.
samuel	's	 kid 	 s 	 	are	in	private	school	,	and	he	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	help	other	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	the	area	 al 	 so 	 	go	 in 	 to 	 	artemisia	production	--	dignity	 be 	 ing 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	wealth	.
the	next	one	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	.
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	a	little	at	oxford	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	some	of	you	 visit 	 ed 	 	a	to	z	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	one	of	the	great	,	real	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	east	africa	.
it	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	that	 live 	 s 	 	at	the	 con 	 flu 	 ence 	 	of	health	and	enterprise	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	story	about	a	public	-	private	solution	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	.
it	 start 	 ed 	 	in	japan	.	sumitomo	had	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	technology	 essential 	 ly 	 	to	impregnate	a	polyethylene	-	based	fiber	with	 organ 	 ic 	 	 insect 	 icide 	 	,	so	you	could	create	a	bed	net	,	a	malaria	bed	net	,	that	would	last	five	 year 	 s 	 	and	not	need	to	be	re	-	dipped	.
it	could	alter	the	vector	,	but	like	artemisia	,	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	 it 	 s 	 	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	sumitomo	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	we	experiment	with	 whet 	 her 	 	we	can	produce	it	in	africa	,	for	africans	?	``
unicef	came	forward	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	'll	buy	most	of	the	 net 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	'll	give	them	away	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	global	fund	's	and	the	u.n.	's	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	and	children	,	for	free	.	``
acumen	came	in	with	the	patient	capital	,	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	to	identify	the	entrepreneur	that	we	would	all	partner	with	here	in	africa	,	and	exxon	 provide 	 d 	 	the	 initi 	 al 	 	 re 	 s 	 in 	 	.
well	,	in	looking	around	for	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	there	was	 non 	 e 	 	better	that	we	could	find	on	earth	than	anuj	shah	,	in	a	to	z	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	company	.
it	's	a	40	-	year	-	old	company	,	it	 understand 	 s 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	gone	from	 social 	 ist 	 	tanzania	 in 	 to 	 	 capital 	 ist 	 	tanzania	,	and	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	flourish	.	it	had	about	1,000	 employ 	 ees 	 	when	we	first	found	it	.
and	so	,	anuj	took	the	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	risk	here	in	africa	to	produce	a	public	good	that	was	 purchase 	 d 	 	by	the	aid	 establish 	 ment 	 	to	work	with	malaria	.
and	,	long	story	short	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	so	 success 	 ful 	 	.
in	our	first	year	,	the	first	net	went	off	the	line	in	october	of	2003	.
we	thought	the	hitting	-	it	-	out	-	of	-	the	-	box	number	was	150,000	 net 	 s 	 	a	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	,	they	are	now	producing	eight	million	 net 	 s 	 	a	year	,	and	they	employ	5,000	people	,	90	percent	of	whom	are	women	,	 most 	 ly 	 	 un 	 skill 	 ed 	 	.
they	're	in	a	joint	venture	with	sumitomo	.
and	so	,	from	an	enterprise	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	for	africa	,	and	from	a	public	health	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	these	are	real	 success 	 es 	 	.
but	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	half	the	story	if	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	at	solving	 problem 	 s 	 	of	poverty	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	long	-	term	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
it	's	a	company	with	one	big	 custom 	 er 	 	.
and	if	 av 	 ian 	 	flu	 hit 	 s 	 	,	or	for	any	other	reason	the	world	 decide 	 s 	 	that	malaria	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	a	 prior 	 ity 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	anuj	and	acumen	have	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 test 	 ing 	 	the	private	sector	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	assumption	that	the	aid	 establish 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	made	is	that	,	look	,	in	a	country	like	tanzania	,	80	percent	of	the	population	 make 	 s 	 	less	than	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
it	 cost 	 s 	 	,	at	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	point	,	six	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	produce	these	,	and	it	 cost 	 s 	 	the	 establish 	 ment 	 	 an 	 other 	 	six	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	 distribut 	 e 	 	it	,	so	the	market	price	in	a	free	market	would	be	about	12	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	net	.
most	people	ca	n't	afford	that	,	so	let	's	give	it	away	free	.
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	option	.
let	's	use	the	market	 a 	 s 	 	the	best	 listen 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	we	have	,	and	understand	at	what	price	people	would	pay	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	they	get	the	dignity	of	choice	.
we	can	start	building	local	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	can	cost	the	public	sector	much	less	.	``
and	so	we	came	in	with	a	second	round	of	patient	capital	to	a	to	z	,	a	loan	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	a	grant	,	so	that	a	to	z	could	play	with	 pric 	 ing 	 	and	listen	to	the	 market 	 place 	 	,	and	found	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	,	that	people	will	pay	different	 price 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	number	of	people	will	come	forth	at	one	dollar	per	net	and	make	a	decision	to	buy	it	.
and	when	you	listen	to	them	,	they	'll	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	lot	to	say	about	what	they	like	and	what	they	do	n't	like	.
and	that	some	of	the	 channel 	 s 	 	we	thought	would	work	did	n't	work	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 experiment 	 ation 	 	and	iteration	that	was	 allow 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	patient	capital	,	we	've	now	found	that	it	 cost 	 s 	 	about	a	dollar	in	the	private	sector	to	 distribut 	 e 	 	,	and	a	dollar	to	buy	the	net	.
so	then	,	from	a	policy	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	when	you	start	with	the	market	,	we	have	a	choice	.
we	can	 continu 	 e 	 	going	 a 	 long 	 	at	12	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	net	,	and	the	 custom 	 er 	 	 pay 	 s 	 	zero	,	or	we	could	at	 l 	 east 	 	experiment	with	some	of	it	,	to	charge	one	dollar	a	net	,	 cost 	 ing 	 	the	public	sector	 an 	 other 	 	six	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	net	,	give	the	people	the	dignity	of	choice	,	and	have	a	 distribut 	 ion 	 	system	that	might	,	over	time	,	start	 sustain 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
we	've	got	to	start	 hav 	 ing 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	think	there	's	any	better	way	to	start	than	using	the	market	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	other	people	to	the	table	around	it	.
 when 	 ever 	 	i	go	to	visit	a	to	z	,	i	think	of	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	stella	.
she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	 t 	 hose 	 	women	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 sew 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
she	grew	up	on	a	farm	in	austria	,	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	,	did	n't	have	 ver 	 y 	 	much	education	.
she	 move 	 d 	 	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	where	she	met	my	 grand 	 father 	 	,	who	was	a	cement	 haul 	 er 	 	,	and	they	had	nine	children	.	three	of	them	 di 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
my	 grand 	 mother 	 	had	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	,	and	she	 work 	 ed 	 	in	a	 sew 	 ing 	 	machine	shop	,	making	 shirt 	 s 	 	for	about	10	 cent 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
she	,	like	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	women	i	see	at	a	to	z	,	 work 	 ed 	 	hard	every	day	,	 under 	 stood 	 	what	 suffer 	 ing 	 	was	,	had	a	deep	faith	in	god	,	 love 	 d 	 	her	children	and	would	never	have	 accept 	 ed 	 	a	 hand 	 out 	 	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	she	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	of	the	 market 	 place 	 	,	and	she	lived	in	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	 provide 	 d 	 	the	 safe 	 ty 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	access	to	 afford 	 able 	 	health	and	education	,	her	children	and	 the 	 ir 	 	children	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	live	 live 	 s 	 	of	real	purpose	and	follow	real	 dream 	 s 	 	.
i	look	around	at	my	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	and	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	--	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	are	a	lot	of	us	--	and	i	see	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 music 	 ians 	 	,	 hedg 	 e 	 	fund	 manage 	 rs 	 	,	 design 	 ers 	 	.
one	sister	who	 make 	 s 	 	other	people	's	 wish 	 es 	 	come	true	.
and	my	wish	,	when	i	see	 t 	 hose 	 	women	,	i	meet	 t 	 hose 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	and	i	think	about	all	the	people	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	continent	who	are	 work 	 ing 	 	hard	every	day	,	is	that	they	have	that	sense	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	 possibil 	 ity 	 	,	and	that	they	 al 	 so 	 	can	 believ 	 e 	 	and	get	access	to	 service 	 s 	 	,	so	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	too	,	can	live	 t 	 hose 	 	 live 	 s 	 	of	great	purpose	.
it	should	n't	be	that	difficult	.
but	what	it	 take 	 s 	 	is	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	from	all	of	us	to	 essential 	 ly 	 	 re 	 fuse 	 	 t 	 rite 	 	 assumption 	 s 	 	,	get	out	of	our	 ideo 	 logical 	 	boxes	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	that	are	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	service	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	to	success	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	your	 arm 	 s 	 	,	both	,	wide	,	and	 expect 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	love	in	return	,	but	 demand 	 ing 	 	 account 	 ability 	 	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	 account 	 ability 	 	to	the	table	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	most	of	all	,	most	of	all	,	it	 requir 	 es 	 	that	all	of	us	have	the	courage	and	the	patience	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	are	rich	or	poor	,	african	or	non	-	african	,	local	or	diaspora	,	left	or	right	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	start	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	.
thank	you	.
