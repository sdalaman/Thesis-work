thank	you	.	i	have	two	 mission 	 s 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	first	is	to	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 poll 	 en 	 	,	i	hope	,	and	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	it	's	more	than	just	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 get 	 s 	 	up	your	nose	.
and	,	 second 	 ly 	 	,	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	every	home	 re 	 ally 	 	ought	to	have	a	 s 	 canning 	 	electron	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
 poll 	 en 	 	is	a	flower	's	way	of	making	more	 flower 	 s 	 	.
it	 car 	 ries 	 	male	 s 	 ex 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	from	one	flower	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	genetic	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	 give 	 s 	 	the	 plant 	 s 	 	genetic	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	better	not	to	mate	with	 your 	 self 	 	.
that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	true	of	 human 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 most 	 ly 	 	.
 poll 	 en 	 	is	 produce 	 d 	 	by	the	 anther 	 s 	 	of	 flower 	 s 	 	.
each	anther	can	carry	up	to	100,000	 grain 	 s 	 	of	 poll 	 en 	 	,	so	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 pro 	 l 	 ific 	 	stuff	.
and	it	is	n't	just	bright	 flower 	 s 	 	that	have	 poll 	 en 	 	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	and	 grass 	 es 	 	.
and	remember	that	all	our	 ce 	 real 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	are	 grass 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
here	is	a	 s 	 canning 	 	electron	 micro 	 graph 	 	of	a	grain	of	 poll 	 en 	 	.
the	little	hole	in	the	middle	,	we	'll	come	to	a	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	,	but	that	's	for	the	 poll 	 en 	 	tube	to	come	out	 lat 	 er 	 	on	.	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	tube	.
so	,	that	's	20	 micro 	 meter 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	that	 poll 	 en 	 	grain	there	.
that	's	about	a	50th	of	a	millimeter	.
but	not	all	 poll 	 en 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	so	simple	looking	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	morina	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plant	--	which	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	to	be	 ra 	 ther 	 	 ted 	 ious 	 	--	named	after	morin	,	who	was	an	 enter 	 pri 	 s 	 ing 	 	french	 garden 	 er 	 	,	who	 issue 	 d 	 	the	first	seed	catalog	in	1621	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	take	a	look	at	 it 	 s 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	i	think	.
that	little	hole	in	the	middle	there	is	for	the	 poll 	 en 	 	tube	,	and	when	the	 poll 	 en 	 	 find 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	special	female	spot	in	 an 	 other 	 	morina	flower	,	just	on	the	right	species	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 poll 	 en 	 	 car 	 ries 	 	the	male	 s 	 ex 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 plant 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 ex 	 	,	they	have	 ramp 	 ant 	 	,	 promisc 	 uous 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 cur 	 ious 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	.	 re 	 ally 	 	.
my	story	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	about	plant	 propag 	 ation 	 	,	but	about	 poll 	 en 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
``	so	,	what	are	 poll 	 en 	 	's	 proper 	 ties 	 	?	``	i	hear	you	ask	.
first	of	all	,	 poll 	 en 	 	is	 tin 	 y 	 	.	 y 	 es 	 	we	know	that	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 bio 	 logically 	 	active	,	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	with	hay	 f 	 ever 	 	will	understand	.
now	,	 poll 	 en 	 	from	 plant 	 s 	 	,	which	are	wind	-	 dispers 	 ed 	 	--	like	 tree 	 s 	 	and	 grass 	 es 	 	and	so	on	--	tend	to	cause	the	most	hay	 f 	 ever 	 	.
and	the	reason	for	that	is	they	've	got	to	chuck	out	 masse 	 s 	 	and	 masse 	 s 	 	of	 poll 	 en 	 	to	have	any	chance	of	the	 poll 	 en 	 	 reach 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	plant	of	the	same	species	.
here	are	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	--	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	if	you	look	at	them	--	of	tree	 poll 	 en 	 	that	is	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	carried	by	the	wind	.
 aga 	 in 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	 s 	 y 	 ca 	 more 	 	--	wind	-	 dispers 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	 tree 	 s 	 	:	 ver 	 y 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	 flower 	 s 	 	,	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	attract	 insect 	 s 	 	.
cool	 poll 	 en 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	i	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	monterey	pine	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	little	air	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	to	make	the	 poll 	 en 	 	carry	even	further	.
remember	,	that	thing	is	just	about	30	 micro 	 meter 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
now	,	it	's	much	more	efficient	if	you	can	get	 insect 	 s 	 	to	do	your	 bid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bee	's	leg	with	the	 poll 	 en 	 	 glom 	 med 	 	onto	it	from	a	 mal 	 low 	 	plant	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	flower	of	the	 man 	 grove 	 	palm	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 show 	 y 	 	,	to	attract	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 insect 	 s 	 	to	do	 it 	 s 	 	 bid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
the	 poll 	 en 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	little	 barb 	 s 	 	on	it	,	if	we	look	.
now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 barb 	 s 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	stick	to	the	 insect 	 s 	 	well	,	but	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	we	can	tell	from	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	,	and	that	is	that	you	might	be	able	to	see	a	fracture	line	 a 	 cross 	 	what	would	be	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	it	was	the	earth	.
that	 tell 	 s 	 	me	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 fossil 	 ized 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	.
and	i	'm	 ra 	 ther 	 	proud	to	say	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	found	just	near	london	,	and	that	55	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	london	was	full	of	 man 	 grove 	 s 	 	.
is	n't	that	cool	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	species	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	be	 dispers 	 ed 	 	by	 insect 	 s 	 	.
you	can	tell	that	from	the	little	 barb 	 s 	 	on	there	.
all	these	 picture 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	taken	with	a	 s 	 canning 	 	electron	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	lab	at	kew	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	.
no	 co 	 incidence 	 	that	these	 we 	 re 	 	taken	by	rob	kesseler	,	who	is	an	artist	,	and	i	think	it	's	 some 	 one 	 	with	a	design	and	 art 	 istic 	 	eye	like	him	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	out	the	best	in	 poll 	 en 	 	.
now	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	can	look	at	a	 poll 	 en 	 	grain	and	tell	what	species	it	came	from	,	and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 hand 	 y 	 	if	you	 may 	 be 	 	have	a	 s 	 ample 	 	and	you	want	to	see	where	it	came	from	.
so	,	different	species	of	 plant 	 s 	 	grow	in	different	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	some	 poll 	 en 	 	 car 	 ries 	 	further	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	,	if	you	have	a	 poll 	 en 	 	 s 	 ample 	 	,	then	in	principle	,	you	should	be	able	to	tell	where	that	 s 	 ample 	 	came	from	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	it	 get 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	for	 forensic 	 s 	 	.
 poll 	 en 	 	is	 tin 	 y 	 	.	it	 get 	 s 	 	on	to	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 stick 	 s 	 	to	them	.
so	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	each	type	of	 poll 	 en 	 	look	different	,	but	each	 habit 	 at 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	different	combination	of	 plant 	 s 	 	.
a	different	 poll 	 en 	 	signature	,	if	you	like	,	or	a	different	 poll 	 en 	 	 finger 	 print 	 	.
by	looking	at	the	 proportion 	 s 	 	and	 combination 	 s 	 	of	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 poll 	 en 	 	in	a	 s 	 ample 	 	,	you	can	tell	 ver 	 y 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	where	it	came	from	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	 poll 	 en 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	a	cotton	shirt	,	similar	to	the	one	that	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	now	.
now	,	much	of	the	 poll 	 en 	 	will	still	be	there	after	 repeat 	 ed 	 	 wash 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
where	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 en 	 	?
four	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	might	look	similar	,	but	they	've	got	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 poll 	 en 	 	 signature 	 s 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	easy	,	these	 picture 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	taken	in	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	 poll 	 en 	 	 forensic 	 s 	 	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	subtle	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	used	now	to	track	where	 counter 	 fe 	 it 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	made	,	where	 bank 	 note 	 s 	 	have	come	from	,	to	look	at	the	 proven 	 ance 	 	of	 anti 	 que 	 s 	 	and	see	that	they	 re 	 ally 	 	did	come	from	the	place	the	seller	 s 	 aid 	 	they	did	.
and	murder	 suspect 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 track 	 ed 	 	using	 the 	 ir 	 	 cloth 	 ing 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	the	u.k.	,	to	 with 	 in 	 	an	area	that	's	small	 en 	 ough 	 	that	you	can	 s 	 end 	 	in	 track 	 er 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	to	find	the	murder	victim	.
so	,	you	can	tell	from	a	piece	of	 cloth 	 ing 	 	to	 with 	 in 	 	about	a	kilometer	or	so	,	where	that	piece	of	 cloth 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	and	then	 s 	 end 	 	in	 dog 	 s 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	in	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 grizz 	 ly 	 	way	,	the	bosnia	war	 crime 	 s 	 	;	some	of	the	people	 br 	 ought 	 	to	trial	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	trial	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	evidence	from	 poll 	 en 	 	,	which	 show 	 ed 	 	that	bodies	had	 be 	 en 	 	buried	,	 ex 	 hum 	 ed 	 	and	then	 re 	 buried 	 	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
i	hope	i	've	 open 	 ed 	 	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	if	you	'll	excuse	the	visual	pun	,	to	some	of	 poll 	 en 	 	's	 secret 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	horse	 chest 	 nut 	 	.
