the	moment	i	say	``	school	,	``	so	 man 	 y 	 	 memor 	 ies 	 	come	back	to	me	.
it	's	like	after	every	 ex 	 am 	 	,	when	i	walk	out	,	the	teacher	would	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	come	.
how	did	you	do	?	``
i	would	say	with	a	great	 s 	 mile 	 	,	``	i	will	 definite 	 ly 	 	pass	.	``
and	i	did	n't	understand	why	,	in	one	hand	they	say	,	``	speak	the	truth	,	``	in	the	other	hand	,	when	you	say	the	truth	,	they	 hat 	 ed 	 	you	.
so	it	went	on	like	that	,	and	i	did	n't	know	where	else	to	find	 my 	 self 	 	.
so	i	remember	 t 	 hose 	 	 night 	 s 	 	i	used	to	go	to	sleep	with	 ask 	 ing 	 	help	from	[	the	]	 un 	 known 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	for	some	reason	,	i	could	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	what	my	father	and	mother	 hang 	 ed 	 	in	the	 pu 	 ja 	 	room	 a 	 s 	 	a	god	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	friend	's	family	had	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 a 	 s 	 	a	god	.
so	i	thought	,	``	i	guess	i	'll	pray	to	[	the	]	 un 	 known 	 	and	ask	help	,	``	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	help	from	 every 	 where 	 	,	each	and	every	corner	of	my	life	at	that	time	.
my	 brother 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	giving	me	a	few	 tip 	 s 	 	about	 draw 	 ing 	 	and	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
then	,	when	i	was	in	eighth	standard	around	13	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	a	part	-	time	job	in	one	of	the	 sign 	 board 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	putu	.
and	then	school	 al 	 so 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 support 	 ing 	 	me	.
``	oh	,	he	's	bad	at	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	but	let	him	 s 	 end 	 	to	the	 draw 	 ing 	 	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	.	``
so	it	was	good	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	with	that	little	tool	that	i	found	to	find	my	own	place	in	school	.
and	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	,	i	just	won	a	small	,	little	transistor	philips	radio	.
and	i	did	n't	have	the	patience	to	wait	 un 	 til 	 	i	 reach 	 ed 	 	home	.
so	i	just	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	on	in	the	train	,	 loud 	 ly 	 	.
if	you	travel	in	indian	 train 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	people	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	radio	and	,	you	know	,	even	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 mobile 	 s 	 	.
so	at	that	time	--	and	i	was	13	--	and	i	was	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	just	radio	,	and	 some 	 one 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	next	to	me	,	like	these	three	people	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	.
you	know	,	like	just	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	to	me	.
he	just	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	where	did	you	buy	the	radio	?	how	much	is	it	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	a	prize	from	[	an	]	art	 com 	 petition 	 	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	teach	at	a	college	of	 art 	 s 	 	.
i	think	you	should	 stud 	 y 	 	in	a	school	of	art	.
you	just	quit	school	and	come	there	.	``
so	,	why	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	you	know	,	 who 	 ever 	 	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	you	can	change	your	whole	life	--	it	's	possible	.
it	is	that	we	need	we	need	to	be	open	and	fine	-	tuned	.
so	that	's	what	made	me	enter	[	the	]	college	of	 art 	 s 	 	after	three	 attempt 	 s 	 	and	just	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 inquir 	 e 	 	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	do	with	art	work	,	or	art	and	 final 	 ly 	 	i	'm	here	in	front	of	you	.
when	i	look	back	,	you	know	,	on	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	between	that	time	and	now	here	--	the	last	10/15	 year 	 s 	 	--	i	can	see	that	most	of	the	 work 	 s 	 	 r 	 evolve 	 	around	three	 subject 	 s 	 	,	but	it	was	not	intentional	.
and	i	just	start	out	with	a	trace	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	?	``	--	you	know	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	[	the	]	past	,	what	 make 	 s 	 	a	person	.
so	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	but	when	you	look	at	the	past	,	the	way	to	understand	the	past	is	 on 	 ly 	 	by	the	 trace 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	not	go	back	[	to	]	the	past	.
it	can	be	 ruin 	 s 	 	,	or	it	can	be	music	,	or	it	can	be	 paint 	 ing 	 	or	 draw 	 ing 	 	or	writing	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
but	it	is	just	a	kind	of	trace	of	that	time	.
and	that	 fascinate 	 d 	 	me	,	to	explore	that	 territ 	 ory 	 	.
so	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	line	,	but	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	about	 trace 	 s 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	 trace 	 s 	 	.
so	here	are	some	of	the	 work 	 s 	 	i	would	like	to	show	you	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	self	in	progress	.	``
it	's	just	a	trace	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	body	.
so	here	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	then	,	you	know	--	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	the	most	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	a	trace	of	 my 	 self 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	3d	photograph	.
so	there	is	an	element	of	performance	,	and	there	is	an	element	of	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	,	and	there	is	an	element	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	one	's	self	,	so	close	to	one	's	self	.
so	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	 fossil 	 s 	 	for	the	future	.
and	then	 move 	 d 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	to	explore	the	other	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	 trace 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	while	 mold 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	great	experience	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 free 	 dom 	 	of	like	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	or	moving	my	hand	or	,	moving	around	in	the	space	,	but	the	moment	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	solid	,	when	you	can	not	move	even	an	inch	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 plast 	 er 	 	of	paris	,	so	the	moment	you	pour	it	it	's	like	liquid	;	but	after	20	 minute 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	hard	stone	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	the	trace	of	a	 thumb 	 print 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 know 	 ing 	 ly 	 	or	 un 	 know 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	we	do	,	you	know	,	we	 leav 	 e 	 	our	 trace 	 s 	 	here	.
so	i	just	thought	,	``	i	'm	going	to	capture	 thumb 	 print 	 	,	 foot 	 print 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	 trace 	 s 	 	we	 leav 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	trace	of	fire	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	trace	of	 s 	 un 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	was	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	 trace 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	thought	 come 	 s 	 	to	me	 al 	 ways 	 	:	is	it	,	 on 	 ly 	 	when	the	object	 touch 	 es 	 	the	thing	and	it	 leav 	 es 	 	the	trace	,	or	is	there	other	ways	to	capture	it	?	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	work	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	like	--	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	length	of	the	lens	,	it	just	 show 	 s 	 	what	is	on	the	other	side	.
so	i	just	put	the	paper	on	the	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	length	,	which	was	an	 etch 	 ing 	 	print	,	then	i	got	the	portrait	of	[	the	]	 s 	 un 	 	from	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	dawn	to	dawn	.	``
what	i	did	here	,	i	just	put	like	10	feet	[	of	]	paper	then	put	a	coconut	rope	,	and	just	 burn 	 t 	 	it	.
so	it	took	about	24	 hour 	 s 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	line	.
so	 where 	 ver 	 	the	fire	is	eating	the	paper	,	that	's	what	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	work	--	detail	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	have	 trace 	 s 	 	when	we	try	to	understand	them	,	the	 per 	 ception 	 	and	 con 	 text 	 	play	a	major	role	to	understand	it	.
so	do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	what	it	is	,	or	are	we	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	what	we	think	it	is	?
then	move	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 question 	 ing 	 	the	 per 	 ception 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	there	are	 trace 	 s 	 	,	when	you	try	to	understand	them	,	you	know	you	play	a	major	role	.
so	like	let	's	say	even	a	simple	act	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	saw	a	cow	 cross 	 ing 	 	in	india	while	you	 we 	 re 	 	coming	from	bangalore	to	mysore	?
can	you	just	raise	the	hand	?
if	you	just	ask	an	opinion	of	how	,	 every 	 one 	 	can	interpret	it	.
like	,	let	's	say	,	if	a	 school 	 teacher 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	she	'll	 simpl 	 y 	 	say	,	``	to	get	to	the	other	side	.	``
why	the	cow	was	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	road	,	you	know	.
the	answer	can	be	so	different	if	potter	 s 	 aid 	 	it	.
he	would	say	,	``	for	the	 great 	 er 	 	good	.	``
martin	luther	king	would	say	,	``	i	imagine	a	world	where	all	 cow 	 s 	 	will	be	free	to	cross	the	road	,	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 motive 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	question	.	``
imagine	moses	 come 	 s 	 	now	,	and	he	 s 	 ees 	 	the	same	cow	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	the	street	.
he	would	 definite 	 ly 	 	say	,	``	god	came	down	from	heaven	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 un 	 to 	 	the	cow	,	'	 th 	 ou 	 	 s 	 halt 	 	cross	the	road	.	'	and	cow	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	road	,	and	there	was	much	 re 	 jo 	 ic 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	holy	cow	.	``
freud	would	say	,	``	the	fact	that	you	're	at	all	 concern 	 ed 	 	 reveal 	 s 	 	your	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	sexual	 in 	 security 	 	.	``
if	we	ask	einstein	,	he	would	say	,	``	 whet 	 her 	 	the	cow	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	road	,	or	the	road	 move 	 d 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	the	cow	,	 depend 	 s 	 	on	your	frame	of	 re 	 ference 	 	.	``
or	buddha	--	if	he	saw	the	same	cow	,	he	would	say	,	``	 ask 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	 deni 	 es 	 	your	own	nature	[	 a 	 s 	 	a	]	cow	.	``
so	,	what	we	see	is	just	what	we	think	often	,	and	most	of	the	time	,	we	do	n't	see	what	it	is	.
it	just	all	 depend 	 s 	 	on	one	's	 per 	 ception 	 	.
and	 con 	 text 	 	,	what	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 con 	 text 	 	?
you	know	,	i	could	just	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	little	piece	of	paper	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 al 	 ways 	 	think	meaning	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	exist	.
the	meaning	of	what	we	create	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	.
it	's	just	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	mind	.
if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	paper	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 bread 	 th 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	length	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	taught	in	school	.
but	if	you	tear	it	in	the	middle	--	now	,	i	did	n't	touch	 th 	 is 	 	 bread 	 th 	 	,	but	still	,	the	meaning	of	 th 	 is 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	 conceiv 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	meaning	is	 al 	 ways 	 	not	there	;	it	's	on	the	other	side	,	even	when	we	say	dark	,	light	,	good	,	bad	,	tall	,	short	--	all	meaning	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	in	 re 	 ality 	 	.
it	's	just	that	 be 	 ing 	 	a	human	,	the	way	we	train	to	perceive	the	 re 	 ality 	 	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	meaning	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	work	from	 th 	 is 	 	period	is	 most 	 ly 	 	like	--	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	work	 call 	 ed 	 	``	light	 make 	 s 	 	dark	.	``
it	's	just	 capture 	 d 	 	through	from	the	lamp	.
so	the	lamp	is	not	just	giving	a	light	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	giving	a	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	work	of	art	,	which	is	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explore	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	limit	out	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	how	 limit 	 ed 	 	our	eye	or	 hear 	 ing 	 	sense	or	touch	--	do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	see	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	exact	negative	.
it	's	about	six	 inch 	 es 	 	deep	in	the	wall	,	but	it	just	 appear 	 s 	 	like	it	's	coming	out	of	the	wall	.
you	know	the	wall	is	 al 	 most 	 	like	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	skin	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	second	,	and	there	's	a	third	,	and	each	 create 	 s 	 	a	meaning	.
and	we	're	just	 pull 	 ing 	 	the	wall	off	the	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	``	 in 	 ward 	 	out	.	``
it	's	a	full	-	figure	cast	from	 my 	 self 	 	.
it	's	about	eight	 inch 	 es 	 	deep	.
when	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 wonder 	 ed 	 	since	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	with	 creator 	 s 	 	--	and	now	you	know	,	i	've	 move 	 d 	 	to	 question 	 ing 	 	the	 per 	 ception 	 	--	 when 	 ever 	 	i	see	the	bird	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	the	sky	,	it	just	 make 	 s 	 	me	feel	like	:	is	there	 any 	 thing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	,	are	there	any	 trace 	 s 	 	up	there	,	which	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	,	we	do	n't	see	them	?
is	there	any	way	to	capture	the	thought	 in 	 to 	 	visual	art	?
i	could	n't	find	it	.
but	a	solution	 arriv 	 ed 	 	after	 be 	 ing 	 	quiet	and	not	 work 	 ing 	 	for	about	six	,	seven	 month 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 rest 	 room 	 	,	when	i	was	changing	the	air	 fresh 	 en 	 er 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	from	solid	 sub 	 stance 	 	to	vapor	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	odonil	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	work	i	made	out	of	that	material	.
the	process	to	get	to	make	the	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	wrote	to	balsara	,	who	 produce 	 s 	 	that	air	 fresh 	 en 	 er 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	odonil	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	dear	 s 	 ir 	 	,	i	am	an	artist	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 catalog 	 ue 	 	.
will	you	help	me	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	?	``
they	never	wrote	back	to	me	.
then	i	thought	,	``	i	will	go	to	the	small	scale	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	facilitating	unit	and	ask	help	.	``
so	i	told	them	,	``	i	'd	like	to	start	an	air	 fresh 	 en 	 er 	 	company	.	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	of	course	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	fee	for	the	project	report	,	and	we	will	give	you	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	,	``	and	they	 g 	 ave 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	went	back	to	them	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	not	for	 start 	 ing 	 	the	company	,	it	's	just	to	make	my	own	work	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	come	for	the	show	.	``
and	they	did	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	work	is	in	the	devi	art	 found 	 ation 	 	in	delhi	.
in	india	,	 no 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	about	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	;	they	 al 	 ways 	 	talk	about	the	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	art	.
you	buy	 th 	 is 	 	for	3,000	 rupee 	 s 	 	,	it	'll	 be 	 come 	 	30,000	in	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	craft	that	was	going	on	,	but	there	are	a	few	 collect 	 ors 	 	who	 al 	 so 	 	collect	art	which	can	depreciate	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 collect 	 ed 	 	by	anapum	--	which	is	like	,	 final 	 ly 	 	in	the	end	,	he	will	not	have	 any 	 thing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	 evapo 	 rate 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	after	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	after	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	all	about	 question 	 ing 	 	the	 pre 	 conception 	 s 	 	.
so	if	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	see	the	portrait	,	``	it	may	not	be	the	portrait	after	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	if	they	say	it	's	solid	,	it	will	not	be	solid	,	it	will	 evapo 	 rate 	 	.
and	if	they	say	they	do	n't	get	it	,	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	not	true	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	in	the	air	.
it	's	in	the	same	 gall 	 ery 	 	or	in	the	same	museum	.
so	they	 inhal 	 ed 	 	it	,	but	they	are	not	aware	of	it	.
while	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	that	work	,	my	mom	and	my	dad	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	it	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	you	deal	with	negative	 subject 	 s 	 	all	the	time	?	``
and	i	was	like	,	``	what	do	you	mean	?	``
``	light	 make 	 s 	 	dark	and	now	 evapo 	 rating 	 	self	.
do	n't	you	think	it	 remain 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	death	,	``	they	 s 	 aid 	 	.
``	of	course	not	.	for	me	,	``	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 tuck 	 ed 	 	in	some	small	solid	,	but	the	moment	it	 evapo 	 rates 	 	,	it	's	 merge 	 d 	 	with	the	whole	.	``
but	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	.	still	,	i	do	n't	like	it	.
can	you	make	 some 	 thing 	 	from	 noth 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	mom	.	it	ca	n't	be	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	create	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	by	 gather 	 ing 	 	dust	together	,	or	we	can	break	the	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	and	get	the	dust	,	but	there	is	 no 	 where 	 	that	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	dust	 in 	 to 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	``
so	,	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	work	for	her	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	angel	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	day	--	it	just	 give 	 s 	 	the	 appear 	 ance 	 	that	one	is	 be 	 coming 	 	the	other	.
so	,	the	same	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	after	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	after	15/20	 day 	 s 	 	.
through	that	small	little	 s 	 lit 	 	between	the	glass	box	and	the	wood	,	the	air	 go 	 es 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	the	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	and	 create 	 s 	 	the	other	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	 great 	 er 	 	faith	.
that	 evapo 	 rating 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	 great 	 er 	 	faith	that	 may 	 be 	 	there	is	 man 	 y 	 	more	 possibil 	 ities 	 	to	capture	[	the	]	 in 	 visible 	 	.
so	what	you	see	now	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	shadow	foreshadow	.	``
and	what	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	is	we	do	n't	see	shadow	,	and	we	do	n't	see	light	too	;	we	see	the	source	of	the	light	.
we	see	where	it	's	 bounc 	 ing 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	see	[	them	]	 a 	 s 	 	they	exist	.
you	know	,	that	's	why	the	night	sky	,	we	see	the	sky	 a 	 s 	 	dark	,	but	it	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	light	all	the	time	.
when	it	's	 bounc 	 ed 	 	on	the	moon	,	we	see	it	.
the	same	thing	in	the	 dark 	 room 	 	.
the	little	dust	particle	will	 aga 	 in 	 	,	reflect	the	light	,	and	we	 real 	 ize 	 	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	light	.
so	we	do	n't	see	dark	,	we	do	n't	see	light	,	we	do	n't	see	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	we	do	n't	see	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
so	,	i	just	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	to	 inquir 	 e 	 	further	about	how	to	sculpt	the	space	between	 th 	 is 	 	object	and	there	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	visual	artist	,	if	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	that	--	but	how	to	sculpt	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	?
if	we	sculpt	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 re 	 ference 	 	 point 	 s 	 	.
the	skin	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 represent 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	skin	at	the	other	end	 al 	 so 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	the	floor	.
i	did	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	experiment	of	 cast 	 ing 	 	the	shadow	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 cor 	 rug 	 ated 	 	box	and	 it 	 s 	 	shadow	.
then	the	second	one	--	the	moment	you	 br 	 ing 	 	any	 in 	 visible 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	visible	world	it	will	have	all	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	the	visible	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
so	that	 produce 	 d 	 	a	shadow	.
then	i	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	let	me	sculpt	that	.
then	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	object	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 throw 	 ing 	 	light	,	then	the	third	one	.
so	what	you	see	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	shadow	of	a	shadow	of	a	shadow	.
and	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	at	that	point	,	there	is	no	shadow	.
i	thought	,	``	oh	,	good	.	work	is	 finish 	 ed 	 	.	``
you	can	see	the	detail	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 gravit 	 y 	 	.	``
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	breath	.	``	it	's	just	two	 hole 	 s 	 	on	the	 gall 	 ery 	 	wall	.
it	's	a	false	wall	,	which	 contain 	 s 	 	like	110	cubic	feet	.
so	that	hole	 actual 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	the	air	come	out	and	go	in	.
so	where	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	we	can	see	,	but	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	will	remain	 in 	 visible 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	the	show	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 in 	 visible 	 	,	``	at	talwar	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	kaayam	.	``
detail	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	,	our	 sense 	 s 	 	are	so	 limit 	 ed 	 	--	we	can	not	hear	 every 	 thing 	 	,	we	can	not	see	 every 	 thing 	 	.
we	do	n't	feel	,	``	i	am	 touch 	 ing 	 	the	air	,	``	but	if	the	breeze	is	a	little	more	 fast 	 er 	 	,	then	i	can	feel	it	.
so	all	of	our	construction	of	 re 	 ality 	 	is	through	these	 limit 	 ed 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	.
so	my	 re 	 course 	 	was	like	,	is	there	any	way	to	use	all	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	just	a	symbol	or	a	sign	?
and	to	 re 	 ally 	 	get	to	the	point	,	we	should	move	beyond	,	you	know	,	go	to	the	other	side	of	the	wall	,	like	in	logic	,	like	are	 in 	 visible 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	see	 some 	 one 	 	 walk 	 s 	 	,	we	see	the	 foot 	 print 	 	.
but	if	we	're	just	cutting	that	 foot 	 print 	 	from	the	whole	thing	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	it	,	you	will	 mis 	 s 	 	the	point	 be 	 cause 	 	the	actual	journey	 happen 	 s 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	are	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	 pass 	 ing 	 	time	.
thank	you	.
