i	want	to	start	with	a	story	,	a	la	seth	godin	,	from	when	i	was	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
my	uncle	ed	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	blue	 sweat 	 er 	 	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	thought	it	was	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	it	had	 fuzz 	 y 	 	 zebra 	 s 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	stomach	,	and	mount	kilimanjaro	and	mount	meru	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	chest	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 fuzz 	 y 	 	.
and	i	 wo 	 re 	 	it	 when 	 ever 	 	i	could	,	 think 	 ing 	 	it	was	the	most	fabulous	thing	i	owned	.
 un 	 til 	 	one	day	in	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	grade	,	when	i	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	with	a	number	of	the	 foot 	 ball 	 	 player 	 s 	 	.
and	my	body	had	 clear 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	matt	mussolina	,	who	was	 un 	 deni 	 ably 	 	my	nemesis	in	high	school	,	 s 	 aid 	 	in	a	 boom 	 ing 	 	voice	that	we	no	 long 	 er 	 	had	to	go	far	away	to	go	on	ski	 trip 	 s 	 	,	but	we	could	all	ski	on	mount	novogratz	.
and	i	was	so	 humil 	 iated 	 	and	 mort 	 ified 	 	that	i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	ran	home	to	my	mother	and	 cha 	 s 	 ti 	 s 	 ed 	 	her	for	ever	 lett 	 ing 	 	me	wear	the	 hide 	 ous 	 	 sweat 	 er 	 	.
we	drove	to	the	 good 	 will 	 	and	we	threw	the	 sweat 	 er 	 	away	 some 	 what 	 	 ceremoni 	 ously 	 	,	my	idea	 be 	 ing 	 	that	i	would	never	have	to	think	about	the	 sweat 	 er 	 	nor	see	it	ever	 aga 	 in 	 	.
fast	forward	--	11	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	'm	a	25	-	year	-	old	kid	.
i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	in	kigali	,	rwanda	,	 jog 	 ging 	 	through	the	steep	 slop 	 es 	 	,	when	i	see	,	10	feet	in	front	of	me	,	a	little	boy	--	11	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	running	 to 	 ward 	 	me	,	 wear 	 ing 	 	my	 sweat 	 er 	 	.
and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	possible	.
but	so	,	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	i	run	up	to	the	child	--	of	course	 scar 	 ing 	 	the	living	bejesus	out	of	him	--	grab	him	by	the	collar	,	turn	it	over	,	and	there	is	my	name	written	on	the	collar	of	 th 	 is 	 	 sweat 	 er 	 	.
i	tell	that	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	and	 continu 	 es 	 	to	serve	 a 	 s 	 	a	metaphor	to	me	about	the	level	of	 connect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	that	we	all	have	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	.
we	so	often	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	what	our	action	and	our	 in 	 action 	 	 do 	 es 	 	to	people	we	think	we	will	never	see	and	never	know	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	tell	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 tell 	 s 	 	a	 large 	 r 	 	contextual	story	of	what	aid	is	and	can	be	.
that	 th 	 is 	 	 travel 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 good 	 will 	 	in	virginia	,	and	 move 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	way	 in 	 to 	 	the	 large 	 r 	 	industry	,	which	at	that	point	was	giving	 million 	 s 	 	of	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 second 	 hand 	 	 cloth 	 ing 	 	to	africa	and	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
which	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	thing	,	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	low	cost	 cloth 	 ing 	 	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	rwanda	,	it	 destroy 	 ed 	 	the	local	 re 	 tail 	 ing 	 	industry	.
not	to	say	that	it	should	n't	have	,	but	that	we	have	to	get	better	at	 answer 	 ing 	 	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	need	to	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	when	we	think	about	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	and	 respons 	 es 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	stick	in	rwanda	,	circa	1985	,	1986	,	where	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	had	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 bake 	 ry 	 	with	20	 un 	 wed 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	bad	news	 bear 	 s 	 	,	``	and	our	 not 	 ion 	 	was	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	corner	the	snack	food	business	in	kigali	,	which	was	not	hard	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 snack 	 s 	 	before	us	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	a	good	business	model	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	it	,	and	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	these	women	transform	on	a	micro	-	level	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	micro	-	finance	bank	,	and	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	iqbal	quadir	is	going	to	talk	about	grameen	,	which	is	the	 grand 	 father 	 	of	all	micro	-	finance	 bank 	 s 	 	,	which	now	is	a	 world 	 wide 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	--	you	talk	about	a	meme	--	but	then	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	new	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	was	moving	from	 bar 	 ter 	 	 in 	 to 	 	trade	.
we	got	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	right	.
we	focused	on	a	business	model	;	we	 insist 	 ed 	 	on	skin	in	the	game	.
the	women	made	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 decision 	 s 	 	at	the	end	of	the	day	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	they	would	use	 th 	 is 	 	access	to	credit	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 business 	 es 	 	,	earn	more	income	so	they	could	take	care	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	better	.
what	we	did	n't	understand	,	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	around	us	,	with	the	 con 	 flu 	 ence 	 	of	fear	,	ethnic	 s 	 tri 	 fe 	 	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	an	aid	game	,	if	you	will	,	that	was	 play 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	but	 certain 	 ly 	 	 palp 	 able 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	 in 	 side 	 	rwanda	,	that	at	that	time	,	30	percent	of	the	budget	was	all	foreign	aid	.
the	genocide	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	1994	,	seven	 year 	 s 	 	after	these	women	all	 work 	 ed 	 	together	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	dream	.
and	the	good	news	was	that	the	institution	,	the	 bank 	 ing 	 	institution	,	 last 	 ed 	 	.
in	fact	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	the	largest	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	lender	in	the	country	.
the	 bake 	 ry 	 	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	,	but	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	for	me	 we 	 re 	 	that	 account 	 ability 	 	 count 	 s 	 	--	got	to	build	 thing 	 s 	 	with	people	on	the	ground	,	using	business	 model 	 s 	 	where	,	 a 	 s 	 	steven	levitt	would	say	,	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	matter	.
understand	,	 how 	 ever 	 	complex	we	may	be	,	 incentive 	 s 	 	matter	.
so	when	chris	raised	to	me	how	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	,	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	a	shift	in	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	,	on	the	one	hand	i	 absolute 	 ly 	 	agree	with	him	,	and	i	was	so	 thrill 	 ed 	 	to	see	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	the	g	8	--	that	the	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	people	like	tony	blair	and	bono	and	bob	geldof	--	the	world	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	global	poverty	;	the	world	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	africa	in	ways	i	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	in	my	life	.
it	's	 thrill 	 ing 	 	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	what	 keep 	 s 	 	me	up	at	night	is	a	fear	that	we	'll	look	at	the	 vict 	 ories 	 	of	the	g	8	--	50	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	aid	to	africa	,	40	billion	in	 reduc 	 ed 	 	debt	--	 a 	 s 	 	the	 vict 	 ory 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	more	than	chapter	one	,	 a 	 s 	 	our	moral	 ab 	 solution 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	what	we	need	to	do	is	see	that	 a 	 s 	 	chapter	one	,	 celebr 	 ate 	 	it	,	close	it	,	and	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	we	need	a	chapter	two	that	is	all	about	 exec 	 ution 	 	,	all	about	the	how	-	to	.
and	if	you	remember	one	thing	from	what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	's	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	end	poverty	,	to	make	it	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	is	to	build	 vi 	 able 	 	 system 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	that	deliver	critical	and	 afford 	 able 	 	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	to	the	poor	,	in	ways	that	are	 financial 	 ly 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	and	 scale 	 able 	 	.
if	we	do	that	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	can	make	poverty	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	it	was	that	--	that	whole	 philosoph 	 y 	 	--	that	 encourag 	 ed 	 	me	to	start	my	current	endeavor	 call 	 ed 	 	``	acumen	fund	,	``	which	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	some	mini	-	 blue 	 print 	 s 	 	for	how	we	might	do	that	in	water	,	health	and	housing	in	pakistan	,	india	,	kenya	,	tanzania	and	egypt	.
and	i	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	that	,	and	some	of	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	so	you	can	see	what	it	is	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
but	before	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	my	pet	 peeve 	 s 	 	--	i	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	who	the	poor	are	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	too	often	talk	about	them	 a 	 s 	 	these	strong	,	huge	 masse 	 s 	 	of	people	 year 	 ning 	 	to	be	free	,	when	in	fact	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	story	.
on	a	macro	level	,	four	billion	people	on	earth	make	less	than	four	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
that	's	who	we	talk	about	when	we	think	about	``	the	poor	.	``
if	you	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	it	,	it	's	the	third	largest	 eco 	 nomy 	 	on	earth	,	and	yet	most	of	these	people	go	 in 	 visible 	 	.
where	we	 typical 	 ly 	 	work	,	there	's	people	making	between	one	and	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
who	are	these	people	?
they	are	 farm 	 ers 	 	and	 factor 	 y 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	.
they	work	in	government	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	.	they	're	 driver 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 domestic 	 s 	 	.
they	 typical 	 ly 	 	pay	for	critical	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	like	water	,	like	 health 	 care 	 	,	like	housing	,	and	they	pay	30	to	40	 time 	 s 	 	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 middle 	 class 	 	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	pay	--	 certain 	 ly 	 	where	we	work	in	karachi	and	nairobi	.
the	poor	 al 	 so 	 	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	make	,	and	do	make	,	smart	 decision 	 s 	 	,	if	you	give	them	that	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
so	,	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
one	is	in	india	,	where	there	are	240	million	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	most	of	whom	make	less	than	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
where	we	work	in	aurangabad	,	the	land	is	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 par 	 ch 	 ed 	 	.
you	see	people	on	average	making	60	 cent 	 s 	 	to	a	dollar	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	in	pink	is	a	social	entrepreneur	named	ami	tabar	.
what	he	did	was	see	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	israel	,	 large 	 r 	 	 approach 	 es 	 	,	and	figure	out	how	to	do	a	drip	 irrig 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	a	way	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	water	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	plant	stock	.
but	 previous 	 ly 	 	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	for	large	-	scale	 farm 	 s 	 	,	so	ami	tabar	took	 th 	 is 	 	and	 modular 	 ized 	 	it	down	to	an	eighth	of	an	acre	.
a	couple	of	 principle 	 s 	 	:	build	small	.
make	it	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 expand 	 able 	 	and	 afford 	 able 	 	to	the	poor	.
 th 	 is 	 	family	,	sarita	and	her	husband	,	 b 	 ought 	 	a	15	-	dollar	unit	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	living	in	a	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	three	-	 wall 	 ed 	 	lean	-	to	with	a	 cor 	 rug 	 ated 	 	iron	roof	.
after	one	harvest	,	they	had	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	income	 en 	 ough 	 	to	buy	a	second	system	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	full	quarter	-	acre	.
a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	meet	them	.
they	now	make	four	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	,	which	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	middle	class	for	india	,	and	they	 show 	 ed 	 	me	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	they	had	just	laid	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	house	.
and	i	 s 	 wear 	 	,	you	could	see	the	future	in	that	woman	's	 eye 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	i	 tru 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	.
you	ca	n't	talk	about	poverty	 to 	 day 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	malaria	bed	 net 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 aga 	 in 	 	give	jeffrey	sachs	of	harvard	huge	kudos	for	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	the	world	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	his	rage	--	for	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	you	can	 s 	 ave 	 	a	life	.
malaria	is	a	disease	that	 kill 	 s 	 	one	to	three	million	people	a	year	.
300	to	500	million	 case 	 s 	 	are	 report 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	africa	 lose 	 s 	 	about	13	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	to	the	disease	.
five	 dollar 	 s 	 	can	 s 	 ave 	 	a	life	.
we	can	 s 	 end 	 	people	to	the	moon	;	we	can	see	if	there	's	life	on	mars	--	why	ca	n't	we	get	five	-	dollar	 net 	 s 	 	to	500	million	people	?
the	question	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	not	``	why	ca	n't	we	?	``
the	question	is	how	can	we	help	africans	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	?
a	lot	of	 hurdle 	 s 	 	.
one	:	production	is	too	low	.	two	:	price	is	too	high	.
three	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	road	in	--	right	near	where	our	 factor 	 y 	 	is	 locate 	 d 	 	.
 distribut 	 ion 	 	is	a	nightmare	,	but	not	 im 	 possible 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	by	making	a	350,000	-	dollar	loan	to	the	largest	 tradition 	 al 	 	bed	net	 manufactur 	 er 	 	in	africa	so	that	they	could	transfer	technology	from	japan	and	build	these	long	-	 last 	 ing 	 	,	five	-	year	 net 	 s 	 	.
here	are	just	some	 picture 	 s 	 	of	the	 factor 	 y 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	company	 ha 	 s 	 	 employ 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	thousand	women	.
it	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	about	600,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 wage 	 s 	 	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	tanzania	.
it	's	the	largest	company	in	tanzania	.
the	 through 	 put 	 	rate	right	now	is	1.5	million	 net 	 s 	 	,	three	million	by	the	end	of	the	year	.
we	hope	to	have	seven	million	at	the	end	of	next	year	.
so	the	production	side	is	 work 	 ing 	 	.
on	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	side	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	world	,	we	have	a	lot	of	work	to	do	.
right	now	,	95	percent	of	these	 net 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	by	the	u.n.	,	and	then	 give 	 n 	 	 prim 	 arily 	 	to	people	around	africa	.
we	're	looking	at	building	on	some	of	the	most	precious	 resource 	 s 	 	of	africa	:	people	.
 the 	 ir 	 	women	.
and	so	i	want	you	to	meet	jacqueline	,	my	 name 	 sake 	 	,	21	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
if	she	 we 	 re 	 	born	 any 	 where 	 	else	but	tanzania	,	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	she	could	run	wall	street	.
she	 run 	 s 	 	two	of	the	lines	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	put	a	down	payment	on	her	house	.
she	 make 	 s 	 	about	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	,	is	creating	an	education	fund	,	and	told	me	she	is	not	 marry 	 ing 	 	nor	 hav 	 ing 	 	children	 un 	 til 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 d 	 	.
and	so	,	when	i	told	her	about	our	idea	--	that	 may 	 be 	 	we	could	take	a	tupperware	model	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	find	a	way	for	the	women	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	go	out	and	sell	these	 net 	 s 	 	to	 other 	 s 	 	--	she	 quick 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 calcul 	 ating 	 	what	she	 her 	 self 	 	could	make	and	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	.
we	took	a	 less 	 on 	 	from	ideo	,	one	of	our	 favor 	 ite 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	and	 quick 	 ly 	 	did	a	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	took	jacqueline	 in 	 to 	 	the	area	where	she	 live 	 s 	 	.
she	 br 	 ought 	 	10	of	the	women	with	whom	she	 interact 	 s 	 	together	to	see	if	she	could	sell	these	 net 	 s 	 	,	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	 a 	 piece 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	people	say	 no 	 body 	 	will	buy	one	,	and	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	how	you	sell	 thing 	 s 	 	.
not	coming	in	with	our	own	 not 	 ions 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	did	n't	even	talk	about	malaria	 un 	 til 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	.
first	,	she	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	comfort	,	 stat 	 us 	 	,	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
these	 net 	 s 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	put	them	on	the	floor	,	 bug 	 s 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	your	house	.
children	can	sleep	through	the	night	;	the	house	 look 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	;	you	hang	them	in	the	window	.
and	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 cur 	 tain 	 s 	 	,	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	but	people	can	see	 stat 	 us 	 	--	that	you	care	about	your	children	.
 on 	 ly 	 	then	did	she	talk	about	saving	your	children	's	 live 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	to	be	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	how	we	sell	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	to	the	poor	.
i	want	to	end	just	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	there	's	enormous	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	poverty	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
to	do	it	right	,	we	have	to	build	business	 model 	 s 	 	that	matter	,	that	are	 scale 	 able 	 	and	that	work	with	africans	,	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	,	people	all	over	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	who	fit	in	 th 	 is 	 	 categor 	 y 	 	,	to	do	it	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	it	's	about	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
