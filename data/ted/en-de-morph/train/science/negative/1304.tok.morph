ben	roche	:	so	i	'm	ben	,	by	the	way	.
homaro	cantu	:	and	i	'm	homaro	.
br	:	and	we	're	 chef 	 s 	 	.	so	when	moto	 open 	 ed 	 	in	2004	,	people	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	to	expect	.	a	lot	of	people	thought	that	it	was	a	japanese	restaurant	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	the	name	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	the	logo	,	which	was	like	a	japanese	character	,	but	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	had	all	these	 request 	 s 	 	for	japanese	food	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	what	we	did	.	and	after	about	the	ten	 thousand 	 th 	 	request	for	a	 ma 	 ki 	 	roll	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	the	people	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 print 	 ed 	 	food	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	 fo 	 ray 	 	 in 	 to 	 	what	we	like	to	call	flavor	 transform 	 ation 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	all	the	flavor	of	,	you	know	,	a	standard	 ma 	 ki 	 	roll	,	 print 	 ed 	 	onto	a	little	piece	of	paper	.
hc	:	so	our	 din 	 ers 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	 bor 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	them	the	same	course	twice	,	so	here	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	an	element	from	the	 ma 	 ki 	 	roll	and	and	took	a	picture	of	a	dish	and	then	 bas 	 ically 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	that	picture	with	the	dish	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	dish	in	 part 	 icular 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 champ 	 agne 	 	with	 sea 	 food 	 	.
the	 champ 	 agne 	 	 grape 	 s 	 	that	you	see	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 carbon 	 ated 	 	 grape 	 s 	 	.	a	little	bit	of	 sea 	 food 	 	and	some	cr√®me	fraiche	and	the	picture	 actual 	 ly 	 	 taste 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	the	dish	.
br	:	but	it	's	not	all	just	 ed 	 ible 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	bit	different	and	transform	 flavor 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	--	so	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	have	carrot	cake	.
so	we	take	a	carrot	cake	,	put	it	in	a	 blend 	 er 	 	,	and	we	have	kind	of	like	a	carrot	cake	juice	,	and	then	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	a	balloon	 froze 	 n 	 	in	liquid	nitrogen	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	hollow	shell	of	carrot	cake	ice	cream	,	i	guess	,	and	it	 come 	 s 	 	off	looking	like	,	you	know	,	jupiter	's	 float 	 ing 	 	around	your	plate	.
so	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	're	 transform 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	have	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 re 	 ference 	 	for	.
hc	:	and	here	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	have	no	 re 	 ference 	 	to	eat	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cigar	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	's	a	cuban	cigar	made	out	of	a	cuban	pork	sandwich	,	so	we	take	these	 spice 	 s 	 	that	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	pork	shoulder	,	we	fashion	that	 in 	 to 	 	ash	.	we	take	the	sandwich	and	wrap	it	up	in	a	 collar 	 d 	 	green	,	put	an	 ed 	 ible 	 	label	that	 bear 	 s 	 	no	 similar 	 ity 	 	to	a	cohiba	cigar	label	,	and	we	put	it	in	a	dollar	ninety	-	nine	ashtray	and	charge	you	about	twenty	 buck 	 s 	 	for	it	.
hc	:	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
br	:	that	's	not	it	,	 th 	 ough 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	making	 food 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	would	n't	eat	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	make	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	look	like	 dish 	 es 	 	that	you	know	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plate	of	nachos	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	our	nachos	and	the	other	guy	's	nachos	,	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	dessert	.
so	the	 chip 	 s 	 	are	 can 	 di 	 ed 	 	,	the	ground	beef	is	made	from	chocolate	,	and	the	cheese	is	made	from	a	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	 man 	 go 	 	 s 	 or 	 bet 	 	that	 get 	 s 	 	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	liquid	nitrogen	to	look	like	cheese	.
and	after	 do 	 ing 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 material 	 ization 	 	and	 reconfigur 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	these	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	 serv 	 ed 	 	it	,	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	the	dish	 actual 	 ly 	 	 behav 	 es 	 	like	the	real	thing	,	where	the	cheese	 begin 	 s 	 	to	melt	.
so	when	you	're	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	thing	in	the	 din 	 ing 	 	room	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 sens 	 ation 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	plate	of	nachos	,	and	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 til 	 	you	begin	tasting	it	that	you	 real 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dessert	,	and	it	's	just	kind	of	like	a	mind	-	ripper	.
hc	:	so	we	had	 be 	 en 	 	creating	all	of	these	 dish 	 es 	 	out	of	a	kitchen	that	was	more	like	a	mechanic	's	shop	than	a	kitchen	,	and	the	next	logical	step	for	us	was	to	install	a	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	and	that	's	what	we	have	here	.
so	we	put	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	,	and	we	got	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	about	food	,	like	serious	 experiment 	 ation 	 	.
br	:	one	of	the	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	lab	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	that	we	have	a	new	science	lab	in	the	kitchen	,	is	that	,	you	know	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	new	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	new	approach	,	all	these	different	 door 	 s 	 	to	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	that	we	never	 k 	 new 	 	 we 	 re 	 	there	 beg 	 an 	 	to	open	,	and	so	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	and	the	food	and	the	 dish 	 es 	 	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	,	they	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	going	further	and	further	out	there	.
hc	:	let	's	talk	about	flavor	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	and	let	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	some	cool	stuff	.
you	see	a	cow	with	 it 	 s 	 	tongue	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	.
what	i	see	is	a	cow	about	to	eat	 some 	 thing 	 	 delic 	 ious 	 	.	what	is	that	cow	eating	?
and	why	is	it	 delic 	 ious 	 	?
so	the	cow	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	eats	three	 bas 	 ic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	feed	:	corn	,	 bee 	 ts 	 	,	and	 bar 	 ley 	 	,	and	so	what	i	do	is	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	my	staff	with	these	crazy	,	wild	 idea 	 s 	 	.	can	we	take	what	the	cow	eats	,	 re 	 move 	 	the	cow	,	and	then	make	some	 ham 	 burger 	 s 	 	out	of	that	?
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 re 	 action 	 	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	kind	of	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
br	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	our	chef	de	 cu 	 is 	 ine 	 	,	chris	jones	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	guy	that	just	 flip 	 s 	 	out	when	we	assign	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	task	,	but	a	lot	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	,	they	're	hard	to	understand	.
they	're	hard	to	just	get	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
there	's	a	lot	of	research	and	a	lot	of	failure	,	trial	and	error	--	i	guess	,	more	error	--	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	each	and	every	dish	,	so	we	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	get	it	right	,	and	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	while	for	us	to	be	able	to	explain	that	to	people	.
hc	:	so	,	after	about	a	day	of	chris	and	i	 star 	 ing 	 	at	each	other	,	we	came	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	close	to	the	 ham 	 burger 	 	 pat 	 ty 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 form 	 s 	 	like	 ham 	 burger 	 	meat	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	made	from	three	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	:	 bee 	 ts 	 	,	 bar 	 ley 	 	,	corn	,	and	so	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cook 	 s 	 	up	like	 ham 	 burger 	 	meat	,	 look 	 s 	 	and	 taste 	 s 	 	like	 ham 	 burger 	 	meat	,	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 re 	 moving 	 	the	cow	from	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
so	 replica 	 ting 	 	food	,	taking	it	 in 	 to 	 	that	next	level	is	where	we	're	going	.
br	:	and	it	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	the	world	's	first	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	veggie	burger	,	which	is	a	cool	side	effect	.
and	a	miracle	berry	,	if	you	're	not	familiar	with	it	,	is	a	natural	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	,	and	it	 contain 	 s 	 	a	special	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
it	's	a	 glyco 	 protein 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 miracul 	 in 	 	,	a	 natural 	 ly 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	thing	.	it	still	 freak 	 s 	 	me	out	every	time	i	eat	it	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 un 	 ique 	 	ability	to	mask	certain	taste	 receptor 	 s 	 	on	your	tongue	,	so	that	 prim 	 arily 	 	 s 	 our 	 	taste	 receptor 	 s 	 	,	so	 normal 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	would	taste	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 our 	 	or	tart	,	 some 	 how 	 	begin	to	taste	 ver 	 y 	 	sweet	.
hc	:	you	're	about	to	eat	a	lemon	,	and	now	it	 taste 	 s 	 	like	 lemon 	 ade 	 	.
let	's	just	stop	and	think	about	the	economic	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
we	could	eliminate	sugar	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	for	all	 confection 	 ary 	 	 product 	 s 	 	and	 soda 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	replace	it	with	all	-	natural	fresh	fruit	.
br	:	so	you	see	us	here	cutting	up	some	 water 	 mel 	 on 	 	.	the	idea	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	we	're	going	to	eliminate	 ton 	 s 	 	of	food	 mile 	 s 	 	,	 waste 	 d 	 	energy	,	and	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	of	tuna	by	creating	tuna	,	or	any	 ex 	 otic 	 	produce	or	item	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	far	-	away	place	,	with	local	,	 organ 	 ic 	 	produce	;	so	we	have	a	 water 	 mel 	 on 	 	from	wisconsin	.
hc	:	so	if	miracle	berries	take	 s 	 our 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	sweet	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	other	 pi 	 xie 	 	dust	that	we	put	on	the	 water 	 mel 	 on 	 	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	go	from	sweet	to	 savor 	 y 	 	.
so	after	we	do	that	,	we	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	vacuum	bag	,	add	a	little	bit	of	 sea 	 weed 	 	,	some	 spice 	 s 	 	,	and	we	roll	it	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 s 	 	taking	on	the	 appear 	 ance 	 	of	tuna	.
so	the	key	now	is	to	make	it	 behav 	 e 	 	like	tuna	.
br	:	and	then	after	a	quick	dip	 in 	 to 	 	some	liquid	nitrogen	to	get	that	perfect	 s 	 ear 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	,	 taste 	 s 	 	and	 behav 	 es 	 	like	the	real	thing	.
hc	:	so	the	key	thing	to	remember	here	is	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	care	what	 th 	 is 	 	tuna	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	good	for	you	and	good	for	the	environment	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.
but	where	is	 th 	 is 	 	going	?
how	can	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 trick 	 ing 	 	your	 taste 	 bud 	 s 	 	and	leapfrog	it	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	do	 to 	 day 	 	that	could	be	a	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	food	technology	?
so	here	's	the	next	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
i	told	the	staff	,	let	's	just	take	a	bunch	of	wild	 plant 	 s 	 	,	think	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	food	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	non	-	 poison 	 ous 	 	to	the	human	body	,	go	out	around	chicago	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	,	take	it	,	blend	it	,	cook	it	and	then	have	 every 	 body 	 	flavor	-	trip	on	it	at	moto	.
let	's	charge	them	a	 boat 	 load 	 	of	cash	for	 th 	 is 	 	and	see	what	they	think	.
br	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	so	you	can	imagine	,	a	task	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 assign 	 ments 	 	that	the	kitchen	staff	 hat 	 ed 	 	us	for	.	but	we	 re 	 ally 	 	had	to	 al 	 most 	 	 re 	 learn 	 	how	to	cook	in	general	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	plant	life	that	we	're	,	one	,	 un 	 familiar 	 	with	,	and	two	,	we	have	no	 re 	 ference 	 	for	how	to	cook	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	do	n't	eat	them	.
so	we	 re 	 ally 	 	had	to	think	about	new	,	creative	ways	to	flavor	,	new	ways	to	cook	and	to	change	 text 	 ure 	 	--	and	that	was	the	main	issue	with	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
hc	:	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	step	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	and	we	leapfrog	 a 	 head 	 	.
so	 develop 	 ing 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	and	first	-	world	 nation 	 s 	 	,	imagine	if	you	could	take	these	wild	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 consum 	 e 	 	them	,	food	 mile 	 s 	 	would	 bas 	 ically 	 	turn	 in 	 to 	 	food	feet	.
 th 	 is 	 	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	of	what	food	is	would	 essential 	 ly 	 	open	up	the	encyclopedia	of	what	raw	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	are	,	even	if	we	just	 swap 	 ped 	 	out	,	say	,	one	of	these	for	flour	,	that	would	eliminate	so	much	energy	and	so	much	waste	.
and	to	give	you	a	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	fed	these	 custom 	 ers 	 	,	there	's	a	bale	of	hay	there	and	some	crab	 apple 	 s 	 	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	we	took	hay	and	crab	 apple 	 s 	 	and	made	barbecue	sauce	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
people	 s 	 wo 	 re 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	eating	barbecue	sauce	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	free	food	.
br	:	 thank 	 s 	 	,	 guy 	 s 	 	.
