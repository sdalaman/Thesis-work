what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	one	idea	.
it	's	an	idea	for	a	new	kind	of	school	,	which	 turn 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	head	much	of	our	 convention 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	 school 	 s 	 	are	for	and	how	they	work	.
and	it	might	just	be	coming	to	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	near	you	soon	.
where	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	is	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	young	 found 	 ation 	 	,	which	,	over	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	come	up	with	 man 	 y 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	in	education	,	like	the	open	university	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 extend 	 ed 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	 school 	 s 	 	for	social	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	summer	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	and	the	school	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	what	was	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	need	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	 school 	 ing 	 	here	in	the	u.k	.
and	we	felt	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 prior 	 ity 	 	was	to	 br 	 ing 	 	together	two	 set 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
one	was	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	 bor 	 ed 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	who	just	did	n't	like	school	,	could	n't	see	any	relationship	between	what	they	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	school	and	future	 job 	 s 	 	.
and	 employ 	 ers 	 	who	 ke 	 pt 	 	 complain 	 ing 	 	that	the	 kid 	 s 	 	coming	out	of	school	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	ready	for	real	work	,	did	n't	have	the	right	 attitude 	 s 	 	and	experience	.
and	so	we	try	to	ask	:	what	kind	of	school	would	have	the	 teenager 	 s 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	to	get	in	,	not	 fight 	 ing 	 	to	stay	out	?
and	after	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 conversation 	 s 	 	with	 teenager 	 s 	 	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 employ 	 ers 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	from	paraguay	to	australia	,	and	looking	at	some	of	the	academic	research	,	which	 show 	 ed 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	what	's	now	 call 	 ed 	 	non	-	cognitive	 skill 	 s 	 	--	the	 skill 	 s 	 	of	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	 resili 	 ence 	 	--	and	that	these	are	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	cognitive	 skill 	 s 	 	--	 form 	 al 	 	academic	 skill 	 s 	 	--	we	came	up	with	an	answer	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	answer	in	a	way	,	which	we	 call 	 ed 	 	the	studio	school	.
and	we	 call 	 ed 	 	it	a	studio	school	to	go	back	to	the	original	idea	of	a	studio	in	the	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	where	work	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	are	 integrate 	 d 	 	.
you	work	by	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	learn	by	 work 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	design	we	came	up	with	had	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	small	 school 	 s 	 	--	about	300	,	400	 pupil 	 s 	 	--	14	to	19	year	-	olds	,	and	 critical 	 ly 	 	,	about	80	percent	of	the	curriculum	 d 	 one 	 	not	through	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	,	but	through	real	-	life	,	practical	 project 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	commission	to	 business 	 es 	 	,	ngo	's	and	 other 	 s 	 	.
that	every	pupil	would	have	a	coach	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	who	would	have	 time 	 table 	 s 	 	much	more	like	a	work	environment	in	a	business	.
and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	 d 	 one 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	public	system	,	funded	by	public	money	,	but	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	run	.
and	all	at	no	extra	cost	,	no	 s 	 election 	 	,	and	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	 pupil 	 s 	 	the	route	 in 	 to 	 	university	,	even	if	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	would	want	to	 be 	 come 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	and	have	manual	 job 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	it	was	some	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 idea 	 s 	 	that	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	learn	best	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	learn	best	in	 team 	 s 	 	and	they	learn	best	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	real	--	all	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	what	 main 	 stream 	 	 school 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
now	that	was	a	nice	idea	,	so	we	 move 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	rapid	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	phase	.
we	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	out	,	first	in	luton	--	famous	for	 it 	 s 	 	 air 	 port 	 	and	not	much	else	,	i	fear	--	and	in	blackpool	--	famous	for	 it 	 s 	 	 beach 	 es 	 	and	leisure	.
and	what	we	found	--	and	we	got	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	and	then	 improv 	 ed 	 	them	--	but	we	found	that	the	young	people	 love 	 d 	 	it	.
they	found	it	much	more	 motiv 	 ation 	 al 	 	,	much	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	than	 tradition 	 al 	 	education	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 import 	 ant 	 	of	all	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	when	the	 ex 	 am 	 	 result 	 s 	 	came	through	,	the	 pupil 	 s 	 	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	put	on	these	field	 trial 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	 low 	 est 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	 group 	 s 	 	had	 jump 	 ed 	 	right	to	the	top	--	in	fact	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	at	the	top	 dec 	 ile 	 	of	performance	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	gcse	's	,	which	is	the	british	 mark 	 ing 	 	system	.
now	not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	that	 influence 	 d 	 	some	people	to	think	we	 we 	 re 	 	onto	 some 	 thing 	 	.
the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	education	down	south	in	london	 de 	 scribed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	``	big	fan	.	``
and	the	business	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	onto	 some 	 thing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	a	way	of	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	children	much	better	for	real	-	life	work	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	head	of	the	 chamber 	 s 	 	of	commerce	is	now	the	 chair 	 man 	 	of	the	studio	 school 	 s 	 	trust	and	 help 	 ing 	 	it	,	not	just	with	big	 business 	 es 	 	,	but	small	 business 	 es 	 	all	over	the	country	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	two	 school 	 s 	 	.
that	's	grown	 th 	 is 	 	year	to	about	10	.
and	next	year	,	we	're	 expect 	 ing 	 	about	35	 school 	 s 	 	open	 a 	 cross 	 	england	,	and	 an 	 other 	 	40	 area 	 s 	 	want	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 school 	 s 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	--	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	rapid	spread	of	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 with 	 out 	 	media	 cover 	 age 	 	.
it	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 with 	 out 	 	big	money	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
it	spread	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	through	word	of	mouth	,	 viral 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 parent 	 s 	 	,	people	 involve 	 d 	 	in	education	.
and	it	spread	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	power	of	an	idea	--	so	the	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	idea	about	 turn 	 ing 	 	education	on	 it 	 s 	 	head	and	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	marginal	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 team 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	practical	 project 	 s 	 	,	and	 put 	 ting 	 	them	right	at	the	heart	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	on	the	 edge 	 s 	 	.
now	there	's	a	whole	set	of	new	 school 	 s 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	 aut 	 umn 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	from	yorkshire	where	,	in	fact	,	my	nephew	,	i	hope	,	will	be	able	to	attend	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	focused	on	creative	and	media	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
other	 one 	 s 	 	have	a	focus	on	health	care	,	 tour 	 ism 	 	,	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	other	 field 	 s 	 	.
we	think	we	're	onto	 some 	 thing 	 	.
it	's	not	perfect	yet	,	but	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	idea	which	can	transform	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	possibly	 million 	 s 	 	,	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	who	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	by	 school 	 ing 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	animate	them	.
they	're	not	like	all	of	you	who	can	 s 	 it 	 	in	 row 	 s 	 	and	hear	 thing 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	you	for	hour	after	hour	.
they	want	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	want	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	,	they	want	education	to	be	for	real	.
and	my	hope	is	that	some	of	you	out	there	may	be	able	to	help	us	.
we	feel	we	're	on	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	a	journey	of	experiment	and	 improve 	 ment 	 	to	turn	the	studio	school	idea	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	present	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	universal	answer	for	every	child	,	but	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	answer	for	some	children	in	every	part	of	the	world	.
and	i	hope	that	a	few	of	you	at	 l 	 east 	 	can	help	us	make	that	happen	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
