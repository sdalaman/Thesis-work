i	want	you	to	put	off	your	 pre 	 conception 	 s 	 	,	your	 pre 	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	 fear 	 s 	 	and	 thought 	 s 	 	about	 reptil 	 es 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	i	'm	going	to	get	my	story	 a 	 cross 	 	to	you	.

 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	we	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	first	species	on	earth	to	be	so	 pro 	 l 	 ific 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	threaten	our	own	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
and	i	know	we	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	 image 	 s 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	us	numb	,	of	the	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	that	we	're	 perpet 	 rating 	 	on	the	planet	.
we	're	kind	of	like	 greed 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	using	it	all	up	,	are	n't	we	?
and	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	time	for	me	to	talk	to	you	about	water	.
it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	like	to	drink	 lot 	 s 	 	of	it	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 marvel 	 ous 	 	 deriv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	beer	,	wine	,	etc	.
and	,	of	course	,	watch	it	fall	from	the	sky	and	flow	in	our	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 river 	 s 	 	,	but	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	other	 reason 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
when	i	was	a	kid	,	growing	up	in	new	york	,	i	was	smitten	by	 snake 	 s 	 	,	the	same	way	most	 kid 	 s 	 	are	smitten	by	 top 	 s 	 	,	 mar 	 ble 	 s 	 	,	 car 	 s 	 	,	 train 	 s 	 	,	cricket	 ball 	 s 	 	.
and	my	mother	,	brave	 lad 	 y 	 	,	was	 part 	 ly 	 	to	blame	,	taking	me	to	the	new	york	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	museum	,	 buy 	 ing 	 	me	 book 	 s 	 	on	 snake 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 start 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 famous 	 	 care 	 er 	 	of	mine	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 culmin 	 ated 	 	in	of	course	,	 arriv 	 ing 	 	in	india	60	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 br 	 ought 	 	by	my	mother	,	doris	norden	,	and	my	 step 	 father 	 	,	rama	chattopadhyaya	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	roller	 coast 	 er 	 	ride	.
two	 animal 	 s 	 	,	two	 icon 	 ic 	 	 reptil 	 es 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 captiv 	 ated 	 	me	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	.
one	of	them	was	the	 remark 	 able 	 	 gha 	 rial 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	crocodile	,	which	 grow 	 s 	 	to	 al 	 most 	 	20	feet	long	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 river 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 charisma 	 tic 	 	snake	,	the	king	 co 	 bra 	 	.
what	my	purpose	of	the	talk	 to 	 day 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	,	is	to	sort	of	 in 	 del 	 ibly 	 	scar	your	 mind 	 s 	 	with	these	 charisma 	 tic 	 	and	 majes 	 tic 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	will	take	away	from	here	,	a	 re 	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	nature	,	i	hope	.
the	king	 co 	 bra 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.
what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	shot	 image 	 s 	 	in	a	forest	 near 	 by 	 	here	,	of	a	female	king	 co 	 bra 	 	making	her	nest	.
here	is	a	 limb 	 less 	 	animal	,	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 gather 	 ing 	 	a	huge	mound	of	 leav 	 es 	 	,	and	then	 lay 	 ing 	 	her	 egg 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	to	 with 	 stand 	 	5	to	10	[	 meter 	 s 	 	of	 rain 	 fall 	 	]	,	in	order	that	the	 egg 	 s 	 	can	 incub 	 ate 	 	over	the	next	90	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	hatch	 in 	 to 	 	little	baby	king	 co 	 bra 	 s 	 	.
so	,	she	 protect 	 s 	 	her	 egg 	 s 	 	,	and	after	three	 month 	 s 	 	,	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	do	hatch	out	.
a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	them	will	die	,	of	course	.	there	is	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 mortal 	 ity 	 	in	little	baby	 reptil 	 es 	 	who	are	just	10	to	12	 inch 	 es 	 	long	.
my	first	experience	with	king	 co 	 bra 	 s 	 	was	in	'72	at	a	 magic 	 al 	 	place	 call 	 ed 	 	agumbe	,	in	karnataka	,	 th 	 is 	 	state	.
and	it	is	a	 marvel 	 ous 	 	rain	forest	.
 th 	 is 	 	first	 en 	 counter 	 	was	kind	of	like	the	maasai	boy	who	 kill 	 s 	 	the	lion	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	warrior	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	 total 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	 br 	 ought 	 	me	straight	 in 	 to 	 	the	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 f 	 ray 	 	.
i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 start 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	research	and	education	station	in	agumbe	,	which	you	are	all	of	course	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	visit	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	base	 where 	 in 	 	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	gather	and	learn	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	about	the	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	complex	forest	system	,	and	try	to	hang	on	to	what	's	there	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	the	water	 source 	 s 	 	are	 protect 	 ed 	 	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	clean	,	and	of	course	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	good	time	too	.
you	can	 al 	 most 	 	hear	the	 drum 	 s 	 	 th 	 rob 	 bing 	 	back	in	that	little	cottage	where	we	stay	when	we	're	there	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	to	get	through	to	the	people	.
and	through	the	children	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	the	way	to	go	.
they	are	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	 snake 	 s 	 	.	they	have	n't	got	that	 steel 	 y 	 	thing	that	you	end	up	either	 fear 	 ing 	 	or	 hat 	 ing 	 	or	 despis 	 ing 	 	or	 loath 	 ing 	 	them	in	some	way	.
they	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	to	start	with	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	idea	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	some	of	these	 snake 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	average	 s 	 ize 	 	king	 co 	 bra 	 	,	about	12	feet	long	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 crawl 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 body 	 	's	 bath 	 room 	 	,	and	was	 hang 	 ing 	 	around	there	for	two	or	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
the	people	of	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	india	worship	the	king	 co 	 bra 	 	.
and	they	did	n't	kill	it	.	they	 call 	 ed 	 	us	to	catch	it	.
now	we	've	caught	more	than	100	king	 co 	 bra 	 s 	 	over	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 re 	 locate 	 d 	 	them	in	 near 	 by 	 	 forest 	 s 	 	.
but	in	order	to	find	out	the	real	 secret 	 s 	 	of	these	 creature 	 s 	 	[	it	was	 necess 	 ary 	 	]	for	us	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	insert	a	small	radio	 transmit 	 ter 	 	 in 	 side 	 	[	each	]	snake	.
now	we	are	able	to	follow	them	and	find	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 secret 	 s 	 	,	where	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	go	after	they	hatch	,	and	 remark 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	you	're	about	to	see	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	just	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	ago	in	agumbe	.
i	had	the	pleasure	of	 be 	 ing 	 	close	to	 th 	 is 	 	large	king	 co 	 bra 	 	who	had	caught	a	 venom 	 ous 	 	pit	viper	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	it	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	bitten	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	king	 co 	 bra 	 s 	 	feed	 on 	 ly 	 	on	 snake 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	[	little	snake	]	was	kind	of	a	tid	-	bit	for	it	,	what	we	'd	call	a	``	 va 	 dai 	 	``	or	a	donut	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
 usual 	 ly 	 	they	eat	 some 	 thing 	 	a	bit	 large 	 r 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	strange	and	 in 	 explicable 	 	activity	 happen 	 ed 	 	over	the	last	 breed 	 ing 	 	season	,	 where 	 in 	 	a	large	male	king	 co 	 bra 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 grab 	 bed 	 	a	female	king	 co 	 bra 	 	,	did	n't	mate	with	it	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	it	and	 swallow 	 ed 	 	it	.
we	're	still	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explain	and	come	to	 term 	 s 	 	with	what	is	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	advantage	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	they	do	 al 	 so 	 	a	lot	of	other	 remark 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	[	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	see	]	by	virtue	of	the	fact	that	we	had	a	radio	 transmit 	 ter 	 	in	one	of	the	 snake 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	male	snake	,	12	feet	long	,	met	 an 	 other 	 	male	king	 co 	 bra 	 	.
and	they	did	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	ritual	combat	dance	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	the	 rut 	 ting 	 	of	 mammal 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 sort 	 ing 	 	out	our	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	but	 gentle 	 r 	 	,	no	 bit 	 ing 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	just	a	 wr 	 est 	 ing 	 	match	,	but	a	 remark 	 able 	 	activity	.
now	,	what	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	information	?
what	's	the	point	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	the	king	 co 	 bra 	 	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	 key 	 stone 	 	species	in	these	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	.
and	our	job	is	to	 con 	 vince 	 	the	 author 	 ities 	 	that	these	 forest 	 s 	 	have	to	be	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	ways	we	do	it	,	by	 learn 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	about	 some 	 thing 	 	so	 remark 	 able 	 	and	so	 icon 	 ic 	 	in	the	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	there	,	in	order	to	help	protect	 tree 	 s 	 	,	 animal 	 s 	 	and	of	course	the	water	 source 	 s 	 	.
you	've	all	heard	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	of	project	tiger	which	 start 	 ed 	 	back	in	the	early	'70s	,	which	was	,	in	fact	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	dynamic	time	for	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 pilot 	 ed 	 	,	i	could	say	,	by	a	 high 	 ly 	 	 auto 	 cratic 	 	 state 	 s 	 woman 	 	,	but	who	 al 	 so 	 	had	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	environment	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	time	when	project	tiger	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
and	,	just	like	project	tiger	,	our	 activ 	 ities 	 	with	the	king	 co 	 bra 	 	is	to	look	at	a	species	of	animal	so	that	we	protect	 it 	 s 	 	 habit 	 at 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	it	.
so	,	the	tiger	is	the	icon	.
and	now	the	king	 co 	 bra 	 	is	a	new	one	.
all	the	major	 river 	 s 	 	in	south	india	are	sourced	in	the	western	ghats	,	the	chain	of	 hill 	 s 	 	running	 a 	 long 	 	the	west	coast	of	india	.
it	 pour 	 s 	 	out	 million 	 s 	 	of	 gallon 	 s 	 	every	hour	,	and	 suppli 	 es 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	to	at	 l 	 east 	 	300	million	people	,	and	 wash 	 es 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	and	of	course	 feed 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	both	domestic	and	wild	,	 produce 	 s 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 ton 	 s 	 	of	rice	.
and	what	do	we	do	?	how	do	we	respond	to	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	dam	it	,	we	pollute	it	,	we	pour	in	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	,	 weed 	 icide 	 s 	 	,	 fungi 	 cides 	 	.
you	drink	it	in	peril	of	your	life	.
and	the	thing	is	,	it	's	not	just	big	industry	.
it	's	not	 mis 	 guide 	 d 	 	river	 engineer 	 s 	 	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	;	it	's	us	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	our	 citizen 	 s 	 	find	the	best	way	to	 dispos 	 e 	 	of	garbage	are	in	water	 source 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	now	we	're	going	north	,	 ver 	 y 	 	far	north	.
north	central	india	,	the	chambal	river	is	where	we	have	our	base	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	home	of	the	 gha 	 rial 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	crocodile	.
it	is	an	animal	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	on	the	earth	for	just	about	100	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	 surviv 	 ed 	 	even	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	time	that	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	off	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 grow 	 s 	 	to	20	feet	long	,	since	it	eats	 on 	 ly 	 	fish	it	's	not	 danger 	 ous 	 	to	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	have	big	 tee 	 th 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	and	it	's	kind	of	hard	to	 con 	 vince 	 	people	if	an	animal	 ha 	 s 	 	big	 tee 	 th 	 	,	that	it	's	a	 harm 	 less 	 	creature	.
but	we	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	back	in	the	early	'70s	,	did	 survey 	 s 	 	,	and	found	that	 gha 	 rial 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	rare	.
in	fact	,	if	you	see	the	map	,	the	range	of	 the 	 ir 	 	original	 habit 	 at 	 	was	all	the	way	from	the	indus	in	pakistan	to	the	irrawaddy	in	burma	.
and	now	it	's	just	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	a	couple	of	 spot 	 s 	 	in	nepal	and	india	.
so	,	in	fact	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	200	 breed 	 ing 	 	 gha 	 rial 	 	left	in	the	wild	.
so	,	 start 	 ing 	 	in	the	mid	-	'70s	when	 conserv 	 ation 	 	was	at	the	fore	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	able	to	start	 project 	 s 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	government	 support 	 ed 	 	to	collect	 egg 	 s 	 	from	the	wild	from	the	few	 remain 	 ing 	 	 nest 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 lease 	 	5,000	baby	 gha 	 rial 	 	back	to	the	wild	.
and	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	we	 we 	 re 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 sight 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	mean	,	just	 in 	 credible 	 	to	see	 bunch 	 es 	 	of	 gha 	 rial 	 	 bask 	 ing 	 	on	the	river	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	 com 	 place 	 ncy 	 	 do 	 es 	 	have	a	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	breed	 con 	 tempt 	 	.
and	,	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	with	all	the	other	 pressure 	 s 	 	on	the	river	,	like	sand	 min 	 ing 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	heavy	 cultiv 	 ation 	 	all	the	way	down	to	the	river	's	edge	,	not	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	 animal 	 s 	 	to	breed	 any 	 more 	 	,	we	're	looking	at	even	more	 problem 	 s 	 	building	up	for	the	 gha 	 rial 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	early	good	 intent 	 ions 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 nest 	 s 	 	 hatch 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	 river 	 side 	 	producing	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 hatch 	 ling 	 s 	 	.	it	's	just	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	sight	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	taken	last	year	.
but	then	the	monsoon	 arriv 	 es 	 	,	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 down 	 river 	 	there	is	 al 	 ways 	 	a	dam	or	there	is	 al 	 ways 	 	a	 bar 	 rage 	 	,	and	,	 s 	 hoop 	 	,	they	get	 wash 	 ed 	 	down	to	 the 	 ir 	 	doom	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	there	is	still	a	lot	of	interest	.
my	 pal 	 s 	 	in	the	crocodile	 special 	 ist 	 	group	of	the	iucn	,	the	[	madras	crocodile	bank	]	,	an	ngo	,	the	world	 wild 	 life 	 	fund	,	the	 wild 	 life 	 	institute	of	india	,	state	forest	 depart 	 ments 	 	,	and	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	environment	,	we	all	work	together	on	stuff	.
but	it	's	possibly	,	and	 definite 	 ly 	 	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	winter	of	2007	and	2008	,	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	die	-	off	of	 gha 	 rial 	 	,	in	the	chambal	river	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 gha 	 rial 	 	 appear 	 ing 	 	on	the	river	,	dead	.
why	?	how	could	it	happen	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	clean	river	.
the	chambal	,	if	you	look	at	it	,	 ha 	 s 	 	clear	water	.
people	scoop	water	out	of	the	chambal	and	drink	it	,	 some 	 thing 	 	you	would	n't	do	in	most	north	indian	 river 	 s 	 	.
so	,	in	order	to	try	to	find	out	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	got	 veterin 	 arian 	 s 	 	from	all	over	the	world	 work 	 ing 	 	with	indian	 vet 	 s 	 	to	try	to	figure	out	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	there	for	a	lot	of	the	 necro 	 psies 	 	on	the	 river 	 side 	 	.
and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	through	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	what	was	going	on	.
and	it	came	down	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 g 	 out 	 	,	which	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 kid 	 ney 	 	 break 	 down 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ur 	 ic 	 	acid	 crystal 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	body	,	and	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	the	 joint 	 s 	 	,	which	made	the	 gha 	 rial 	 	 un 	 able 	 	to	swim	.
and	it	's	a	 horr 	 ibly 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	death	.
just	 down 	 river 	 	from	the	chambal	is	the	 filth 	 y 	 	yamuna	river	,	the	sacred	yamuna	river	.
and	i	hate	to	be	so	 iron 	 ic 	 	and	 s 	 ar 	 cast 	 ic 	 	about	it	but	it	's	the	truth	.	it	's	just	one	of	the	 filth 	 iest 	 	 cess 	 pool 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	.

so	,	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	that	the	toxin	that	was	 kill 	 ing 	 	the	 gha 	 rial 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	food	chain	,	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	fish	they	 we 	 re 	 	eating	.
and	,	you	know	,	once	a	toxin	is	in	the	food	chain	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 affect 	 ed 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	these	 river 	 s 	 	are	the	 life 	 blood 	 	of	people	all	 a 	 long 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	course	.
in	order	to	try	to	answer	some	of	these	 question 	 s 	 	,	we	 aga 	 in 	 	turn	to	technology	,	to	 bio 	 logical 	 	technology	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 tele 	 metry 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	 radio 	 s 	 	on	10	 gha 	 rial 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	.	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	 every 	 day 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	,	to	try	to	find	out	what	 th 	 is 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	toxin	is	.
the	chambal	river	is	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	place	.
it	's	a	place	that	's	famous	to	a	lot	of	you	who	know	about	the	 bandit 	 s 	 	,	the	dacoits	who	used	to	work	up	there	.	and	there	still	are	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	around	.
but	poolan	devi	was	one	[	of	them	]	.	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	shekhar	kapur	made	an	 in 	 credible 	 	movie	,	``	the	bandit	 que 	 en 	 	,	``	which	i	urge	you	to	see	.
you	'll	get	to	see	the	 in 	 credible 	 	[	chambal	]	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	heavy	 fish 	 ing 	 	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	last	 re 	 posit 	 ories 	 	of	the	ganges	river	dolphin	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	species	of	 turtle 	 s 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 migr 	 atory 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	,	and	 fish 	 ing 	 	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	now	[	these	]	new	 element 	 s 	 	of	human	 in 	 toler 	 ance 	 	for	river	 creature 	 s 	 	like	the	 gha 	 rial 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	if	they	do	n't	drown	in	the	net	,	then	they	 simpl 	 y 	 	cut	 the 	 ir 	 	 beak 	 s 	 	off	.
 animal 	 s 	 	like	the	ganges	river	dolphin	which	is	just	down	to	a	few	left	,	and	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	 critical 	 ly 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	who	is	next	?	us	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	all	dependent	on	these	water	 source 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	all	know	about	the	narmada	river	,	the	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	of	 dam 	 s 	 	,	the	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	of	huge	 project 	 s 	 	which	 dis 	 place 	 	people	and	wreck	river	 system 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 livelihood 	 s 	 	.
and	 develop 	 ment 	 	just	 bas 	 ically 	 	going	 ber 	 s 	 er 	 k 	 	,	for	a	double	figure	growth	index	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
so	,	we	're	not	 s 	 ure 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	story	is	going	to	end	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	got	a	happy	or	 s 	 ad 	 	 end 	 ing 	 	.
and	climate	change	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	going	to	turn	all	of	our	 the 	 ories 	 	and	 predict 	 ions 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	.
we	're	still	 work 	 ing 	 	hard	at	it	.
we	've	got	a	lot	of	a	good	team	of	people	 work 	 ing 	 	up	there	.
and	the	thing	is	,	you	know	,	the	decision	makers	,	the	 folk 	 s 	 	in	power	,	they	're	up	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 bungalow 	 s 	 	and	so	on	in	delhi	,	in	the	city	 capital 	 s 	 	.	they	are	all	 suppli 	 ed 	 	with	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	water	.	it	's	cool	.
but	out	on	the	 river 	 s 	 	there	are	still	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	in	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	shape	.
and	it	's	a	 b 	 leak 	 	future	for	them	.
so	,	we	have	our	ganges	and	yamuna	 clean 	 up 	 	project	.
we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	it	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	show	for	it	.	 in 	 credible 	 	.
so	,	people	talk	about	 politic 	 al 	 	will	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	die	-	off	of	the	 gha 	 rial 	 	we	did	 galvan 	 ize 	 	a	lot	of	action	.
government	cut	through	all	the	red	tape	,	we	got	foreign	 vet 	 s 	 	on	it	.	it	was	great	.
so	,	we	can	do	it	.
but	if	you	 s 	 troll 	 	down	to	the	yamuna	or	to	the	gomati	in	lucknow	,	or	to	the	adyar	river	in	chennai	,	or	the	mula	-	mutha	river	in	pune	,	just	see	what	we	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	to	a	river	.	it	's	 s 	 ad 	 	.
but	i	think	the	final	note	 re 	 ally 	 	is	that	we	can	do	it	.
the	 corporate 	 s 	 	,	the	 artist 	 s 	 	,	the	 wild 	 life 	 	nuts	,	the	good	old	 every 	 day 	 	 folk 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	these	 river 	 s 	 	back	.
and	the	final	word	is	that	there	is	a	king	 co 	 bra 	 	looking	over	our	 shoulder 	 s 	 	.
and	there	is	a	 gha 	 rial 	 	looking	at	us	from	the	river	.
and	these	are	 power 	 ful 	 	water	 totem 	 s 	 	.
and	they	are	going	to	disturb	our	 dream 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	we	do	the	right	thing	.

it	's	not	like	the	 ted 	 dy 	 	bear	.

 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	just	like	a	little	snack	for	him	,	you	know	?
