so	it	's	1995	,	i	'm	in	college	,	and	a	friend	and	i	go	on	a	road	trip	from	providence	,	rhode	 is 	 land 	 	to	portland	,	oregon	.
and	you	know	,	we	're	young	and	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	,	so	we	do	the	whole	thing	on	back	 road 	 s 	 	through	state	 park 	 s 	 	and	national	 forest 	 s 	 	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 long 	 est 	 	route	we	can	possibly	take	.
and	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	middle	of	south	dakota	,	i	turn	to	my	friend	and	i	ask	her	a	question	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 both 	 er 	 ing 	 	me	for	2,000	 mile 	 s 	 	.
``	what	's	up	with	the	chinese	character	i	keep	 see 	 ing 	 	by	the	side	of	the	road	?	``
my	friend	 look 	 s 	 	at	me	 total 	 ly 	 	 blank 	 ly 	 	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	in	the	front	row	who	's	 do 	 ing 	 	a	perfect	 imit 	 ation 	 	of	her	look	.
and	i	'm	like	,	``	you	know	,	all	the	 sign 	 s 	 	we	keep	 see 	 ing 	 	with	the	chinese	character	on	them	.	``
she	just	 star 	 es 	 	at	me	for	a	few	 moment 	 s 	 	,	and	then	she	 crack 	 s 	 	up	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 figure 	 s 	 	out	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
and	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
right	,	the	famous	chinese	character	for	picnic	area	.
i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	my	life	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 situ 	 ations 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	why	we	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 mis 	 understand 	 	the	 sign 	 s 	 	around	us	,	and	how	we	 behav 	 e 	 	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	and	what	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	can	tell	us	about	human	nature	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	heard	chris	say	,	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	five	 year 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	wrong	.
 th 	 is 	 	might	strike	you	 a 	 s 	 	a	strange	 care 	 er 	 	move	,	but	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	one	great	advantage	:	no	job	 com 	 petition 	 	.
in	fact	,	most	of	us	do	 every 	 thing 	 	we	can	to	avoid	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	wrong	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	to	avoid	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	we	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	wrong	.
we	get	it	in	the	abstract	.
we	all	know	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 make 	 s 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
the	human	species	,	in	general	,	is	 fall 	 ible 	 	--	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	fine	.
but	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	me	,	right	now	,	to	all	the	 belief 	 s 	 	i	hold	,	here	in	the	present	tense	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	abstract	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	 fall 	 ibility 	 	 go 	 es 	 	out	the	window	--	and	i	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	of	 any 	 thing 	 	i	'm	wrong	about	.
and	the	thing	is	,	the	present	tense	is	where	we	live	.
we	go	to	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	the	present	tense	;	we	go	on	family	 vac 	 ations 	 	in	the	present	tense	;	we	go	to	the	 poll 	 s 	 	and	vote	in	the	present	tense	.
so	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	we	all	kind	of	wind	up	 travel 	 ing 	 	through	life	,	trapped	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	bubble	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	right	about	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	.
i	think	it	's	a	problem	for	each	of	us	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	,	in	our	personal	and	professional	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	it	's	a	problem	for	all	of	us	 collect 	 ively 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	culture	.
so	what	i	want	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	,	first	of	all	,	talk	about	why	we	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	right	.
and	second	,	why	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	problem	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	it	is	possible	to	step	 out 	 side 	 	of	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	and	that	if	you	can	do	so	,	it	is	the	single	 great 	 est 	 	moral	,	intellectual	and	creative	leap	you	can	make	.
so	why	do	we	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	right	?
one	reason	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	wrong	.
so	let	me	ask	you	 guy 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	or	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	let	me	ask	you	 guy 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	right	here	:	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	feel	--	 emotion 	 ally 	 	--	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	feel	to	be	wrong	?
 dread 	 ful 	 	.	 thumb 	 s 	 	down	.
 embarrass 	 ing 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	great	.
 dread 	 ful 	 	,	 thumb 	 s 	 	down	,	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	--	thank	you	,	these	are	great	 answer 	 s 	 	,	but	they	're	 answer 	 s 	 	to	a	different	question	.
you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 answer 	 ing 	 	the	question	:	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	feel	to	 real 	 ize 	 	you	're	wrong	?
 real 	 izing 	 	you	're	wrong	can	feel	like	all	of	that	and	a	lot	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	right	?
i	mean	it	can	be	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	,	it	can	be	 revel 	 atory 	 	,	it	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 quit 	 e 	 	funny	,	like	my	stupid	chinese	character	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
but	just	 be 	 ing 	 	wrong	 do 	 es 	 	n't	feel	like	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	an	 analog 	 y 	 	.
do	you	remember	that	 loo 	 ny 	 	 tune 	 s 	 	cartoon	where	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	pathetic	coyote	who	's	 al 	 ways 	 	chasing	and	never	 catch 	 ing 	 	a	 road 	 runner 	 	?
in	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	every	episode	of	 th 	 is 	 	cartoon	,	there	's	a	moment	where	the	coyote	is	chasing	the	 road 	 runner 	 	and	the	 road 	 runner 	 	 run 	 s 	 	off	a	cliff	,	which	is	fine	--	he	's	a	bird	,	he	can	fly	.
but	the	thing	is	,	the	coyote	 run 	 s 	 	off	the	cliff	right	after	him	.
and	what	's	funny	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	if	you	're	six	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	is	that	the	coyote	's	 total 	 ly 	 	fine	too	.
he	just	 keep 	 s 	 	running	--	right	up	 un 	 til 	 	the	moment	that	he	 look 	 s 	 	down	and	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	he	's	in	mid	-	air	.
that	's	when	he	 fall 	 s 	 	.
when	we	're	wrong	about	 some 	 thing 	 	--	not	when	we	 real 	 ize 	 	it	,	but	before	that	--	we	're	like	that	coyote	after	he	's	gone	off	the	cliff	and	before	he	 look 	 s 	 	down	.
you	know	,	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	wrong	,	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	in	trouble	,	but	we	feel	like	we	're	on	solid	ground	.
so	i	should	 actual 	 ly 	 	correct	 some 	 thing 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	a	moment	ago	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	feel	like	 some 	 thing 	 	to	be	wrong	;	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	 be 	 ing 	 	right	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	reason	,	a	structural	reason	,	why	we	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 right 	 ness 	 	.
i	call	 th 	 is 	 	error	 blind 	 ness 	 	.
most	of	the	time	,	we	do	n't	have	any	kind	of	internal	cue	to	let	us	know	that	we	're	wrong	about	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	's	too	late	.
but	there	's	a	second	reason	that	we	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	cultural	.
think	back	for	a	moment	to	 element 	 ary 	 	school	.
you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	in	class	,	and	your	teacher	is	 hand 	 ing 	 	back	quiz	 paper 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	them	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	mine	,	by	the	way	.
so	there	you	are	in	grade	school	,	and	you	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	to	think	about	the	kid	who	got	 th 	 is 	 	paper	.
it	's	the	dumb	kid	,	the	 trouble 	 maker 	 	,	the	one	who	never	 do 	 es 	 	his	 home 	 work 	 	.
so	by	the	time	you	are	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	you	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	first	of	all	,	that	people	who	get	stuff	wrong	are	 laz 	 y 	 	,	 ir 	 respons 	 ible 	 	 d 	 im 	 wit 	 s 	 	--	and	second	of	all	,	that	the	way	to	succeed	in	life	is	to	never	make	any	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
we	learn	these	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
and	a	lot	of	us	--	and	i	suspect	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	deal	with	them	by	just	 be 	 coming 	 	perfect	little	a	 student 	 s 	 	,	 perfect 	 ion 	 ists 	 	,	over	-	achievers	.
right	,	mr.	cfo	,	 astro 	 physicist 	 	,	ultra	-	 marathon 	 er 	 	?
you	're	all	cfo	,	 astro 	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	ultra	-	marathoners	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	fine	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	that	then	we	freak	out	at	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	we	've	gotten	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	 mean 	 s 	 	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	us	.
so	we	just	insist	that	we	're	right	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	us	feel	smart	and	 respons 	 ible 	 	and	virtuous	and	safe	.
so	let	me	tell	you	a	story	.
a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	woman	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	beth	israel	deaconess	medical	center	for	a	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
beth	israel	's	in	boston	.
it	's	the	 teach 	 ing 	 	hospital	for	harvard	--	one	of	the	best	 hospital 	 s 	 	in	the	country	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	woman	 come 	 s 	 	in	and	she	's	taken	 in 	 to 	 	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	.
she	's	 anesthet 	 ized 	 	,	the	surgeon	 do 	 es 	 	his	thing	--	 stitch 	 es 	 	her	back	up	,	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	her	out	to	the	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	room	.
 every 	 thing 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	gone	fine	.
and	she	 wake 	 s 	 	up	,	and	she	 look 	 s 	 	down	at	 her 	 self 	 	,	and	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	why	is	the	wrong	side	of	my	body	in	 band 	 age 	 s 	 	?	``
well	the	wrong	side	of	her	body	is	in	 band 	 age 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	surgeon	 ha 	 s 	 	 perform 	 ed 	 	a	major	operation	on	her	left	leg	 in 	 stead 	 	of	her	right	one	.
when	the	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	for	health	care	quality	at	beth	israel	spoke	about	 th 	 is 	 	incident	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	for	 what 	 ever 	 	reason	,	the	surgeon	 simpl 	 y 	 	felt	that	he	was	on	the	correct	side	of	the	patient	.	``
the	point	of	 th 	 is 	 	story	is	that	 trust 	 ing 	 	too	much	in	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	on	the	correct	side	of	 any 	 thing 	 	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	internal	sense	of	 right 	 ness 	 	that	we	all	experience	so	often	is	not	a	 reli 	 able 	 	guide	to	what	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	on	in	the	external	world	.
and	when	we	act	like	it	is	,	and	we	stop	 entertain 	 ing 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	we	could	be	wrong	,	well	that	's	when	we	end	up	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 dump 	 ing 	 	200	million	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	oil	 in 	 to 	 	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	,	or	 torpedo 	 ing 	 	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	huge	practical	problem	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	huge	social	problem	.
think	for	a	moment	about	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	feel	right	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	think	that	your	 belief 	 s 	 	just	 perfect 	 ly 	 	reflect	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	when	you	feel	that	way	,	you	've	got	a	problem	to	solve	,	which	is	,	how	are	you	going	to	explain	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	disagree	with	you	?
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	most	of	us	explain	 t 	 hose 	 	people	the	same	way	,	by	 resort 	 ing 	 	to	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 assumption 	 s 	 	.
the	first	thing	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	do	when	 some 	 one 	 	 disagree 	 s 	 	with	us	is	we	just	 assum 	 e 	 	they	're	 ignor 	 ant 	 	.
they	do	n't	have	access	to	the	same	information	that	we	do	,	and	when	we	 gen 	 er 	 ously 	 	share	that	information	with	them	,	they	're	going	to	see	the	light	and	come	on	over	to	our	team	.
when	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	when	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	 t 	 hose 	 	people	have	all	the	same	 fact 	 s 	 	that	we	do	and	they	still	disagree	with	us	,	then	we	move	on	to	a	second	assumption	,	which	is	that	they	're	 idiot 	 s 	 	.
they	have	all	the	right	 piece 	 s 	 	of	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	,	and	they	are	too	 moron 	 ic 	 	to	put	them	together	 correct 	 ly 	 	.
and	when	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	when	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	people	who	disagree	with	us	have	all	the	same	 fact 	 s 	 	we	do	and	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	smart	,	then	we	move	on	to	a	third	assumption	:	they	know	the	truth	,	and	they	are	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	 distort 	 ing 	 	it	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 male 	 vol 	 ent 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 catastroph 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 attach 	 ment 	 	to	our	own	 right 	 ness 	 	 keep 	 s 	 	us	from	 prevent 	 ing 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	when	we	 absolute 	 ly 	 	need	to	and	 cause 	 s 	 	us	to	treat	each	other	 terr 	 ibly 	 	.
but	to	me	,	what	's	most	 baffl 	 ing 	 	and	most	tragic	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	it	 mis 	 s 	 es 	 	the	whole	point	of	 be 	 ing 	 	human	.
it	's	like	we	want	to	imagine	that	our	 mind 	 s 	 	are	just	these	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 trans 	 lu 	 cent 	 	 window 	 s 	 	and	we	just	 gaz 	 e 	 	out	of	them	and	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	 un 	 fold 	 s 	 	.
and	we	want	 every 	 body 	 	else	to	 gaz 	 e 	 	out	of	the	same	window	and	see	the	exact	same	thing	.
that	is	not	true	,	and	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	life	would	be	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
the	miracle	of	your	mind	is	n't	that	you	can	see	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	.
it	's	that	you	can	see	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	n't	.
we	can	remember	the	past	,	and	we	can	think	about	the	future	,	and	we	can	imagine	what	it	's	like	to	be	some	other	person	in	some	other	place	.
and	we	all	do	 th 	 is 	 	a	little	 different 	 ly 	 	,	which	is	why	we	can	all	look	up	at	the	same	night	sky	and	see	 th 	 is 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	why	we	get	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	.
1,200	 year 	 s 	 	before	descartes	 s 	 aid 	 	his	famous	thing	about	``	i	think	 there 	 fore 	 	i	am	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	st.	augustine	,	 s 	 at 	 	down	and	wrote	``	fallor	 er 	 go 	 	sum	``	--	``	i	 er 	 r 	 	 there 	 fore 	 	i	am.	``
augustine	 under 	 stood 	 	that	our	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	screw	up	,	it	's	not	some	kind	of	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	defect	in	the	human	system	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	 eradic 	 ate 	 	or	 over 	 come 	 	.
it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	fundamental	to	who	we	are	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 un 	 like 	 	god	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	's	going	on	out	there	.
and	 un 	 like 	 	all	of	the	other	 animal 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	it	out	.
to	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	obsession	is	the	source	and	root	of	all	of	our	 product 	 ivity 	 	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
last	year	,	for	 vari 	 ous 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	a	lot	of	 episode 	 s 	 	of	the	public	radio	show	 th 	 is 	 	american	life	.
and	so	i	'm	 listen 	 ing 	 	and	i	'm	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	and	at	some	point	,	i	start	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	all	the	 st 	 ories 	 	are	about	 be 	 ing 	 	wrong	.
and	my	first	thought	was	,	``	i	've	lost	it	.
i	've	 be 	 come 	 	the	crazy	 wrong 	 ness 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	.
i	just	 imagin 	 ed 	 	it	 every 	 where 	 	,	``	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
but	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	chance	to	interview	ira	glass	,	who	's	the	host	of	the	show	.
and	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	him	,	and	he	was	like	,	``	no	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	true	.
in	fact	,	``	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	a	staff	,	we	joke	that	every	single	episode	of	our	show	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	crypto	-	theme	.
and	the	crypto	-	theme	is	:	'	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	one	thing	was	going	to	happen	and	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 happen 	 ed 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.	'	and	the	thing	is	,	``	 say 	 s 	 	ira	glass	,	``	we	need	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	need	these	 moment 	 s 	 	of	surprise	and	 revers 	 al 	 	and	 wrong 	 ness 	 	to	make	these	 st 	 ories 	 	work	.	``
and	for	the	rest	of	us	,	audience	 member 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 listen 	 ers 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 read 	 ers 	 	,	we	eat	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	up	.
we	love	 thing 	 s 	 	like	plot	 twist 	 s 	 	and	red	 her 	 ring 	 s 	 	and	surprise	 end 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	our	 st 	 ories 	 	,	we	love	 be 	 ing 	 	wrong	.

george	bush	thought	he	was	going	to	 invad 	 e 	 	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	find	a	bunch	of	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	liberate	the	people	and	 br 	 ing 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	to	the	middle	east	.

and	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 happen 	 ed 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.

for	good	and	for	ill	,	we	generate	these	 in 	 credible 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	about	the	world	around	us	,	and	then	the	world	 turn 	 s 	 	around	and	 astonish 	 es 	 	us	.
no	offense	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	entire	 con 	 ference 	 	is	an	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	monument	to	our	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	get	stuff	wrong	.

so	here	we	are	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	that	's	how	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
we	come	up	with	 an 	 other 	 	idea	.
we	tell	 an 	 other 	 	story	.
