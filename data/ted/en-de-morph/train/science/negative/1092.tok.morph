imagine	if	you	could	record	your	life	--	 every 	 thing 	 	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	you	did	,	 avail 	 able 	 	in	a	perfect	 memor 	 y 	 	store	at	your	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	,	so	you	could	go	back	and	find	 memor 	 able 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 live 	 	them	,	or	sift	through	 trace 	 s 	 	of	time	and	discover	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	your	own	life	that	 previous 	 ly 	 	had	gone	 un 	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
well	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	journey	that	my	family	 beg 	 an 	 	five	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	wife	and	 collabor 	 ator 	 	,	rupal	.
and	on	 th 	 is 	 	day	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	house	with	our	first	child	,	our	 beaut 	 iful 	 	baby	boy	.
and	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	house	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	home	video	 record 	 ing 	 	system	.
man	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
deb	roy	:	 th 	 is 	 	moment	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	other	 moment 	 s 	 	special	for	us	 we 	 re 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	in	our	home	 be 	 cause 	 	in	every	room	in	the	house	,	if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	up	,	you	'd	see	a	camera	and	a	 micro 	 phone 	 	,	and	if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	down	,	you	'd	get	 th 	 is 	 	bird	's	-	eye	view	of	the	room	.
here	's	our	living	room	,	the	baby	 bed 	 room 	 	,	kitchen	,	 din 	 ing 	 	room	and	the	rest	of	the	house	.
and	all	of	these	fed	 in 	 to 	 	a	 dis 	 c 	 	array	that	was	designed	for	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	capture	.
so	here	we	are	 fly 	 ing 	 	through	a	day	in	our	home	 a 	 s 	 	we	move	from	 s 	 un 	 lit 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	through	 inc 	 and 	 escent 	 	 even 	 ing 	 	and	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 light 	 s 	 	out	for	the	day	.
over	the	course	of	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	 record 	 ed 	 	eight	to	10	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	,	 a 	 mass 	 ing 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	a	quarter	-	million	 hour 	 s 	 	of	multi	-	track	audio	and	video	.
so	you	're	looking	at	a	piece	of	what	is	by	far	the	largest	home	video	 collect 	 ion 	 	ever	made	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	data	 represent 	 s 	 	for	our	family	at	a	personal	level	,	the	impact	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	immense	,	and	we	're	still	 learn 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	value	.
 count 	 less 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 solicit 	 ed 	 	natural	 moment 	 s 	 	,	not	posed	 moment 	 s 	 	,	are	 capture 	 d 	 	there	,	and	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	learn	how	to	discover	them	and	find	them	.
but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	scientific	reason	that	drove	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	which	was	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	natural	 long 	 itudinal 	 	data	to	understand	the	process	of	how	a	child	 learn 	 s 	 	language	--	that	child	 be 	 ing 	 	my	son	.
and	so	with	 man 	 y 	 	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	 pro 	 vision 	 s 	 	put	in	place	to	protect	 every 	 one 	 	who	was	 record 	 ed 	 	in	the	data	,	we	made	 element 	 s 	 	of	the	data	 avail 	 able 	 	to	my	 trust 	 ed 	 	research	team	at	mit	so	we	could	start	 teas 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	massive	data	set	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	influence	of	social	 environment 	 s 	 	on	language	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	.
so	we	're	looking	here	at	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	wife	and	i	 cook 	 ing 	 	 break 	 fast 	 	in	the	kitchen	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	move	through	space	and	through	time	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 every 	 day 	 	pattern	of	life	in	the	kitchen	.
in	order	to	convert	 th 	 is 	 	 opa 	 que 	 	,	90,000	 hour 	 s 	 	of	video	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	could	start	to	see	,	we	use	motion	analysis	to	pull	out	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	move	through	space	and	through	time	,	what	we	call	space	-	time	 worm 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	our	 tool 	 kit 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	look	and	see	where	the	 activ 	 ities 	 	are	in	the	data	,	and	with	it	,	trace	the	pattern	of	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	where	my	son	 move 	 d 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	home	,	so	that	we	could	focus	our	 tran 	 script 	 ion 	 	 effort 	 s 	 	,	all	of	the	speech	environment	around	my	son	--	all	of	the	 word 	 s 	 	that	he	heard	from	 my 	 self 	 	,	my	wife	,	our	 nann 	 y 	 	,	and	over	time	,	the	 word 	 s 	 	he	 beg 	 an 	 	to	produce	.
so	with	that	technology	and	that	data	and	the	ability	to	,	with	machine	 assist 	 ance 	 	,	 tran 	 scribe 	 	speech	,	we	've	now	 tran 	 scribed 	 	well	over	seven	million	 word 	 s 	 	of	our	home	 tran 	 script 	 s 	 	.
and	with	that	,	let	me	take	you	now	for	a	first	tour	 in 	 to 	 	the	data	.
so	you	've	all	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 s 	 een 	 	time	-	lapse	 video 	 s 	 	where	a	flower	will	blossom	 a 	 s 	 	you	 accele 	 rate 	 	time	.
i	'd	like	you	to	now	experience	the	 blossom 	 ing 	 	of	a	speech	form	.
my	son	,	soon	after	his	first	 birth 	 day 	 	,	would	say	``	gaga	``	to	mean	water	.
and	over	the	course	of	the	next	half	-	year	,	he	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	approximate	the	proper	adult	form	,	``	water	.	``
so	we	're	going	to	 cruis 	 e 	 	through	half	a	year	in	about	40	 second 	 s 	 	.
no	video	here	,	so	you	can	focus	on	the	sound	,	the	 acoustic 	 s 	 	,	of	a	new	kind	of	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	:	gaga	to	water	.
baby	:	gagagagagaga	gaga	gaga	gaga	 g 	 uga 	 	 g 	 uga 	 	 g 	 uga 	 	 wa 	 da 	 	gaga	gaga	 g 	 uga 	 	gaga	 wa 	 der 	 	 g 	 uga 	 	 g 	 uga 	 	water	water	water	water	water	water	water	water	water	.
dr	:	he	 s 	 ure 	 	 nail 	 ed 	 	it	,	did	n't	he	.
so	he	did	n't	just	learn	water	.
over	the	course	of	the	24	 month 	 s 	 	,	the	first	two	 year 	 s 	 	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	focused	on	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	of	every	word	he	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	 chrono 	 logical 	 	order	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	full	 tran 	 script 	 s 	 	,	we	've	identified	each	of	the	503	 word 	 s 	 	that	he	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	produce	by	his	second	 birth 	 day 	 	.
he	was	an	early	 talk 	 er 	 	.
and	so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	why	.
why	 we 	 re 	 	certain	 word 	 s 	 	born	before	 other 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	first	 result 	 s 	 	that	came	out	of	our	 stud 	 y 	 	a	little	over	a	year	ago	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	us	.
the	way	to	interpret	 th 	 is 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	simple	graph	is	,	on	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	is	an	 indic 	 ation 	 	of	how	complex	 care 	 giver 	 	 utter 	 ance 	 s 	 	are	based	on	the	length	of	 utter 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
and	the	[	 horizon 	 tal 	 	]	axis	is	time	.
and	all	of	the	data	,	we	 align 	 ed 	 	based	on	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	idea	:	every	time	my	son	would	learn	a	word	,	we	would	trace	back	and	look	at	all	of	the	language	he	heard	that	 contain 	 ed 	 	that	word	.
and	we	would	plot	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	length	of	the	 utter 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	found	was	 th 	 is 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	,	that	 care 	 giver 	 	speech	would	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	dip	to	a	 minim 	 um 	 	,	making	language	 a 	 s 	 	simple	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	and	then	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	ascend	back	up	in	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
and	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	was	that	 bounc 	 e 	 	,	that	dip	,	lined	up	 al 	 most 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	with	when	each	word	was	born	--	word	after	word	,	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
so	it	 appear 	 s 	 	that	all	three	 prim 	 ary 	 	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	--	 my 	 self 	 	,	my	wife	and	our	 nann 	 y 	 	--	 we 	 re 	 	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	and	,	i	would	think	,	 sub 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	 rest 	 ructur 	 ing 	 	our	language	to	meet	him	at	the	birth	of	a	word	and	 br 	 ing 	 	him	 gent 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	more	complex	language	.
and	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	but	one	i	just	want	to	point	out	,	is	that	there	must	be	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	 loop 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	my	son	is	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	his	 linguist 	 ic 	 	environment	,	but	the	environment	is	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	him	.
that	environment	,	people	,	are	in	these	tight	 feed 	 back 	 	 loop 	 s 	 	and	creating	a	kind	of	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	 un 	 til 	 	now	.
but	that	's	looking	at	the	speech	 con 	 text 	 	.
what	about	the	visual	 con 	 text 	 	?
we	're	not	looking	at	--	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 doll 	 house 	 	 cut 	 away 	 	of	our	house	.
we	've	taken	 t 	 hose 	 	 circul 	 ar 	 	fish	-	eye	lens	 camera 	 s 	 	,	and	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	some	optical	 correct 	 ion 	 	,	and	then	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	three	-	dimensional	life	.
so	welcome	to	my	home	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	moment	,	one	moment	 capture 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	create	the	ultimate	 memor 	 y 	 	machine	,	where	you	can	go	back	and	 interact 	 ively 	 	fly	around	and	then	breathe	video	-	life	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	system	.
what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	give	you	an	 accele 	 rated 	 	view	of	30	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	of	just	life	in	the	living	room	.
that	's	me	and	my	son	on	the	floor	.
and	there	's	video	 analytic 	 s 	 	that	are	 track 	 ing 	 	our	 move 	 ments 	 	.
my	son	is	 leav 	 ing 	 	red	ink	.	i	am	 leav 	 ing 	 	green	ink	.
we	're	now	on	the	couch	,	looking	out	through	the	window	at	 car 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ing 	 	by	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	my	son	 play 	 ing 	 	in	a	 walk 	 ing 	 	 to 	 y 	 	by	 him 	 self 	 	.
now	we	freeze	the	action	,	30	 minute 	 s 	 	,	we	turn	time	 in 	 to 	 	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	axis	,	and	we	open	up	for	a	view	of	these	 interact 	 ion 	 	 trace 	 s 	 	we	've	just	left	 be 	 hind 	 	.
and	we	see	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	--	these	little	 knot 	 s 	 	of	two	 color 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 read 	 	we	call	``	social	hot	 spot 	 s 	 	.	``
the	spiral	 th 	 read 	 	we	call	a	``	 s 	 olo 	 	hot	spot	.	``
and	we	think	that	these	affect	the	way	language	is	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
what	we	'd	like	to	do	is	start	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	between	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	the	language	that	my	son	is	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	to	see	if	we	can	predict	how	the	structure	of	when	 word 	 s 	 	are	heard	 affect 	 s 	 	when	they	're	 learn 	 ed 	 	--	so	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	relationship	between	 word 	 s 	 	and	what	they	're	about	in	the	world	.
so	here	's	how	we	're	 approach 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	my	son	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 trac 	 ed 	 	out	.
he	's	 leav 	 ing 	 	red	ink	 be 	 hind 	 	.
and	there	's	our	 nann 	 y 	 	by	the	door	.
 nann 	 y 	 	:	you	want	water	?
 nann 	 y 	 	:	all	right	.
dr	:	she	 off 	 ers 	 	water	,	and	off	go	the	two	 worm 	 s 	 	over	to	the	kitchen	to	get	water	.
and	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	use	the	word	``	water	``	to	tag	that	moment	,	that	bit	of	activity	.
and	now	we	take	the	power	of	data	and	take	every	time	my	son	ever	heard	the	word	water	and	the	 con 	 text 	 	he	saw	it	in	,	and	we	use	it	to	penetrate	through	the	video	and	find	every	activity	trace	that	co	-	 occur 	 red 	 	with	an	 in 	 stance 	 	of	water	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	data	 leav 	 es 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	wake	is	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
we	call	these	 word 	 scapes 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 word 	 s 	 cape 	 	for	the	word	water	,	and	you	can	see	most	of	the	action	is	in	the	kitchen	.
that	's	where	 t 	 hose 	 	big	 peak 	 s 	 	are	over	to	the	left	.
and	just	for	contrast	,	we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	any	word	.
we	can	take	the	word	``	bye	``	 a 	 s 	 	in	``	good	bye	.	``
and	we	're	now	 zoom 	 ed 	 	in	over	the	 en 	 trance 	 	to	the	house	.
and	we	look	,	and	we	find	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	expect	,	a	contrast	in	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	where	the	word	``	bye	``	 occur 	 s 	 	much	more	in	a	 structure 	 d 	 	way	.
so	we	're	using	these	 structure 	 s 	 	to	start	 predict 	 ing 	 	the	order	of	language	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	,	and	that	's	 on 	 going 	 	work	now	.
in	my	lab	,	which	we	're	 peer 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	now	,	at	mit	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	at	the	media	lab	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	way	of	 video 	 graph 	 ing 	 	just	about	any	space	.
three	of	the	key	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	philip	decamp	,	rony	kubat	and	brandon	roy	are	 picture 	 d 	 	here	.
philip	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	close	 collabor 	 ator 	 	on	all	the	 visual 	 ization 	 s 	 	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	.
and	michael	fleischman	was	 an 	 other 	 	ph.d.	student	in	my	lab	who	 work 	 ed 	 	with	me	on	 th 	 is 	 	home	video	analysis	,	and	he	made	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	:	that	``	just	the	way	that	we	're	 analyz 	 ing 	 	how	language	 connect 	 s 	 	to	 event 	 s 	 	which	provide	common	ground	for	language	,	that	same	idea	we	can	take	out	of	your	home	,	deb	,	and	we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	it	to	the	world	of	public	media	.	``
and	so	our	effort	took	an	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	turn	.
think	of	mass	media	 a 	 s 	 	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	common	ground	and	you	have	the	recipe	for	taking	 th 	 is 	 	idea	to	a	whole	new	place	.
we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	 analyz 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	content	using	the	same	 principle 	 s 	 	--	 analyz 	 ing 	 	event	structure	of	a	tv	signal	--	 episode 	 s 	 	of	 show 	 s 	 	,	 commercial 	 s 	 	,	all	of	the	 component 	 s 	 	that	make	up	the	event	structure	.
and	we	're	now	,	with	satellite	 dish 	 es 	 	,	 pull 	 ing 	 	and	 analyz 	 ing 	 	a	good	part	of	all	the	tv	 be 	 ing 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	you	do	n't	have	to	now	go	and	instrument	living	rooms	with	 micro 	 phone 	 s 	 	to	get	people	's	 conversation 	 s 	 	,	you	just	tune	 in 	 to 	 	 public 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	social	media	 feed 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	 pull 	 ing 	 	in	about	three	billion	 comment 	 s 	 	a	month	,	and	then	the	magic	 happen 	 s 	 	.
you	have	the	event	structure	,	the	common	ground	that	the	 word 	 s 	 	are	about	,	coming	out	of	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	 feed 	 s 	 	;	you	've	got	the	 conversation 	 s 	 	that	are	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	;	and	through	semantic	analysis	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	real	data	you	're	looking	at	from	our	data	 process 	 ing 	 	--	each	yellow	line	is	 show 	 ing 	 	a	link	 be 	 ing 	 	made	between	a	comment	in	the	wild	and	a	piece	of	event	structure	coming	out	of	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	signal	.
and	the	same	idea	now	can	be	built	up	.
and	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	 word 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	now	 word 	 s 	 	are	not	 assemble 	 d 	 	in	my	living	room	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	the	 con 	 text 	 	,	the	common	ground	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	are	the	content	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	that	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	 conversation 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	,	these	 sky 	 scrap 	 ers 	 	now	,	are	 comment 	 ary 	 	that	are	linked	to	content	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
same	 con 	 cept 	 	,	but	looking	at	communication	 dynamic 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	sphere	.
and	so	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 measur 	 ing 	 	content	based	on	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	are	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	data	for	looking	at	 engage 	 ment 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	content	.
and	just	like	we	can	look	at	 feed 	 back 	 	 cycle 	 s 	 	and	 dynamic 	 s 	 	in	a	family	,	we	can	now	open	up	the	same	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	and	look	at	much	 large 	 r 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 sub 	 set 	 	of	data	from	our	 data 	 base 	 	--	just	50,000	out	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	million	--	and	the	social	graph	that	 connect 	 s 	 	them	through	 public 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 source 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	put	them	on	one	plain	,	a	second	plain	is	where	the	content	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	the	 program 	 s 	 	and	the	 s 	 port 	 ing 	 	 event 	 s 	 	and	the	 commercial 	 s 	 	,	and	all	of	the	link	 structure 	 s 	 	that	tie	them	together	make	a	content	graph	.
and	then	the	 import 	 ant 	 	third	dimension	.
each	of	the	 link 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 render 	 ed 	 	here	is	an	actual	 connect 	 ion 	 	made	between	 some 	 thing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	and	a	piece	of	content	.
and	there	are	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	now	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	these	 link 	 s 	 	that	give	us	the	 connect 	 ive 	 	tissue	of	social	 graph 	 s 	 	and	how	they	 re 	 late 	 	to	content	.
and	we	can	now	start	to	 prob 	 e 	 	the	structure	in	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	.
so	if	we	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	trace	the	path	of	one	piece	of	content	that	 drive 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	to	comment	on	it	,	and	then	we	follow	where	that	comment	 go 	 es 	 	,	and	then	look	at	the	entire	social	graph	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 activate 	 d 	 	and	then	trace	back	to	see	the	relationship	between	that	social	graph	and	content	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	structure	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	visible	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	a	co	-	 view 	 ing 	 	 cl 	 ique 	 	,	a	virtual	living	room	if	you	will	.
and	there	are	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	at	play	.
it	's	not	one	way	.
a	piece	of	content	,	an	event	,	 cause 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	to	talk	.
they	talk	to	other	people	.
that	 drive 	 s 	 	tune	-	in	behavior	back	 in 	 to 	 	mass	media	,	and	you	have	these	 cycle 	 s 	 	that	drive	the	 over 	 all 	 	behavior	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	different	--	 an 	 other 	 	actual	person	in	our	 data 	 base 	 	--	and	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	,	if	not	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	of	these	.
we	've	 give 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	person	a	name	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	pro	-	amateur	,	or	pro	-	am	media	critic	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	high	fan	-	out	rate	.
so	a	lot	of	people	are	 follow 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	person	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	--	and	they	have	a	 prop 	 en 	 s 	 ity 	 	to	talk	about	what	's	on	tv	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	person	is	a	key	link	in	 connect 	 ing 	 	mass	media	and	social	media	together	.
one	last	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	data	:	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	piece	of	content	that	is	special	.
so	if	we	go	and	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	content	,	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	's	state	of	the	 un 	 ion 	 	address	from	just	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	look	at	what	we	find	in	 th 	 is 	 	same	data	set	,	at	the	same	scale	,	the	 engage 	 ment 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	content	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	.
a	nation	 expl 	 o 	 d 	 ing 	 	in	conversation	in	real	time	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	what	's	on	the	 broad 	 cast 	 	.
and	of	course	,	through	all	of	these	lines	are	 flow 	 ing 	 	 un 	 structure 	 d 	 	language	.
we	can	x	-	ray	and	get	a	real	-	time	 puls 	 e 	 	of	a	nation	,	real	-	time	sense	of	the	social	 react 	 ions 	 	in	the	different	 circuit 	 s 	 	in	the	social	graph	 be 	 ing 	 	 activate 	 d 	 	by	content	.
so	,	to	summarize	,	the	idea	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	 a 	 s 	 	our	world	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 instrument 	 ed 	 	and	we	have	the	 cap 	 abilities 	 	to	collect	and	connect	the	 dot 	 s 	 	between	what	people	are	 say 	 ing 	 	and	the	 con 	 text 	 	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	it	in	,	what	's	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	is	an	ability	to	see	new	social	 structure 	 s 	 	and	 dynamic 	 s 	 	that	have	 previous 	 ly 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	.
it	's	like	building	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	or	 tele 	 scope 	 	and	 reveal 	 ing 	 	new	 structure 	 s 	 	about	our	own	behavior	around	communication	.
and	i	think	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	here	are	 pro 	 found 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	for	science	,	for	commerce	,	for	government	,	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	of	all	,	for	us	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
and	so	just	to	return	to	my	son	,	when	i	was	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	he	was	looking	over	my	shoulder	,	and	i	 show 	 ed 	 	him	the	 clip 	 s 	 	i	was	going	to	show	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	for	 per 	 mission 	 	--	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	i	went	on	to	reflect	,	``	is	n't	it	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	entire	 data 	 base 	 	,	all	these	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	hand	off	to	you	and	to	your	sister	``	--	who	 arriv 	 ed 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	``	and	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	able	to	go	back	and	re	-	experience	 moment 	 s 	 	that	you	could	never	,	with	your	 bio 	 logical 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	,	possibly	remember	the	way	you	can	now	?	``
and	he	was	quiet	for	a	moment	.
and	i	thought	,	``	what	am	i	 think 	 ing 	 	?
he	's	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	.	he	's	not	going	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	just	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	that	thought	,	he	 look 	 ed 	 	up	at	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	that	when	i	grow	up	,	i	can	show	 th 	 is 	 	to	my	 kid 	 s 	 	?	``
and	i	thought	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 power 	 ful 	 	stuff	.	``
so	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	one	last	 memor 	 able 	 	moment	from	our	family	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	time	our	son	took	more	than	two	 step 	 s 	 	at	once	--	 capture 	 d 	 	on	film	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	you	to	focus	on	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	take	you	through	.
it	's	a	 cl 	 utter 	 ed 	 	environment	;	it	's	natural	life	.
my	mother	's	in	the	kitchen	,	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	and	,	of	all	 place 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 hall 	 way 	 	,	i	 real 	 ize 	 	he	's	about	to	do	it	,	about	to	take	more	than	two	 step 	 s 	 	.
and	so	you	hear	me	 encourag 	 ing 	 	him	,	 real 	 izing 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	the	magic	 happen 	 s 	 	.
listen	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
about	three	 step 	 s 	 	in	,	he	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	magic	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	of	all	 kick 	 s 	 	in	,	and	he	 take 	 s 	 	a	breath	in	,	and	he	 whisper 	 s 	 	``	 w 	 ow 	 	``	and	 instinct 	 ively 	 	i	echo	back	the	same	.
and	so	let	's	fly	back	in	time	to	that	 memor 	 able 	 	moment	.
dr	:	 he 	 y 	 	.
come	here	.
can	you	do	it	?
oh	,	boy	.
can	you	do	it	?
baby	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
dr	:	ma	,	he	's	 walk 	 ing 	 	.
dr	:	thank	you	.
