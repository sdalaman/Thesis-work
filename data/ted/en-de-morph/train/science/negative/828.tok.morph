first	of	all	,	i	'm	a	geek	.
i	'm	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	food	-	eating	,	carbon	 foot 	 print 	 	-	 minim 	 izing 	 	,	robotic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	geek	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	build	green	,	but	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	suspicious	of	all	of	these	well	-	meaning	 article 	 s 	 	,	people	long	on	moral	 author 	 ity 	 	and	short	on	data	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	how	to	do	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	have	to	figure	 th 	 is 	 	out	for	 my 	 self 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	is	 th 	 is 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	?
i	have	 drop 	 ped 	 	a	blob	of	 organ 	 ic 	 	yogurt	from	happy	self	-	 actual 	 ized 	 	local	 cow 	 s 	 	on	my	counter	top	,	and	i	grab	a	paper	 to 	 wel 	 	and	i	want	to	wipe	it	up	.
but	can	i	use	a	paper	 to 	 wel 	 	?
the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	found	in	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	amount	of	energy	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	any	paper	 to 	 wel 	 	or	 embodi 	 ed 	 	water	,	and	every	time	i	use	a	paper	 to 	 wel 	 	,	i	am	using	 th 	 is 	 	much	virtual	energy	and	water	.
wipe	it	up	,	throw	it	away	.
now	,	if	i	 compar 	 e 	 	that	to	a	cotton	 to 	 wel 	 	that	i	can	use	a	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	have	a	whole	lot	of	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	 un 	 til 	 	i	wash	that	 yogurt 	 y 	 	 to 	 wel 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	now	 oper 	 ating 	 	energy	.
so	if	i	throw	my	 to 	 wel 	 	in	the	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	,	i	've	now	put	energy	and	water	back	 in 	 to 	 	that	 to 	 wel 	 	...
 un 	 less 	 	i	use	a	front	-	 load 	 ing 	 	,	high	-	efficiency	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	,	and	then	it	 look 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	better	.
but	what	about	a	 recycl 	 ed 	 	paper	 to 	 wel 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	little	half	 sheet 	 s 	 	?
well	,	now	a	paper	 to 	 wel 	 	 look 	 s 	 	better	.
screw	the	paper	 to 	 wel 	 s 	 	.	let	's	go	to	a	sponge	.
i	wipe	it	up	with	a	sponge	,	and	i	put	it	under	the	running	water	,	and	i	have	a	lot	less	energy	and	a	lot	more	water	.
 un 	 less 	 	you	're	like	me	and	you	 leav 	 e 	 	the	handle	in	the	position	of	hot	even	when	you	turn	it	on	,	and	then	you	start	to	use	more	energy	.
or	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	you	let	it	run	 un 	 til 	 	it	's	warm	to	rinse	out	your	 to 	 wel 	 	.
and	now	all	 bet 	 s 	 	are	off	.
so	what	 th 	 is 	 	 say 	 s 	 	is	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	 l 	 east 	 	expect	--	the	position	in	which	you	put	the	handle	--	have	a	 big 	 ger 	 	effect	than	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	optimize	.
now	imagine	 some 	 one 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 twist 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	me	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	a	house	.
that	's	what	my	husband	and	i	are	 do 	 ing 	 	right	now	.
and	so	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	,	how	green	could	we	be	?
and	there	's	a	thousand	and	one	 article 	 s 	 	out	there	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	how	to	make	all	these	green	trade	-	offs	.
and	they	are	just	 a 	 s 	 	suspect	in	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	to	optimize	these	little	 thing 	 s 	 	around	the	 edge 	 s 	 	and	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	elephant	in	the	living	room	.
now	,	the	average	house	 ha 	 s 	 	about	300	megawatt	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	in	it	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	energy	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	make	it	--	 million 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	paper	 to 	 wel 	 s 	 	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	how	much	better	we	could	do	.
and	so	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	we	start	with	a	house	on	a	lot	,	and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	typical	construction	on	the	top	and	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	on	the	bottom	.
so	first	,	we	demolish	it	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	some	energy	,	but	if	you	 de 	 construct 	 	it	--	you	take	it	all	 a 	 part 	 	,	you	use	the	bits	--	you	can	get	some	of	that	energy	back	.
we	then	 d 	 ug 	 	a	big	hole	to	put	in	a	 rain 	 water 	 	 catch 	 ment 	 	tank	to	take	our	yard	water	 in 	 dependent 	 	.
and	then	we	 pour 	 ed 	 	a	big	 found 	 ation 	 	for	 pass 	 ive 	 	solar	.
now	,	you	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	by	about	25	percent	by	using	high	fly	ash	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
we	then	put	in	framing	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	framing	--	lumber	,	composite	 material 	 s 	 	--	and	it	's	kind	of	hard	to	get	the	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	out	of	that	,	but	it	can	be	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	resource	if	you	use	fsc	-	 cert 	 ified 	 	lumber	.
we	then	go	on	to	the	first	thing	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	.
if	we	put	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	 window 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	house	,	we	would	double	the	energy	use	right	there	.
now	,	pvc	is	a	little	bit	better	,	but	still	not	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	wood	that	we	chose	.
we	then	put	in	 plumb 	 ing 	 	,	 electric 	 al 	 	and	hvac	,	and	insulate	.
now	,	spray	foam	is	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	 insula 	 tor 	 	--	it	 fill 	 s 	 	in	all	the	 crack 	 s 	 	--	but	it	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	high	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	,	and	,	 spray 	 ed 	 	-	in	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	or	blue	 jean 	 s 	 	is	a	much	lower	energy	 alter 	 native 	 	to	that	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	used	straw	bale	 in 	 fill 	 	for	our	library	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	zero	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	.
when	it	 come 	 s 	 	time	to	 sheet 	 rock 	 	,	if	you	use	ecorock	it	's	about	a	quarter	of	the	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	of	standard	 sheet 	 rock 	 	.
and	then	you	get	to	the	 finish 	 es 	 	,	the	subject	of	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	``	go	green	``	 article 	 s 	 	,	and	on	the	scale	of	a	house	they	 al 	 most 	 	make	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	at	all	.
and	yet	,	all	the	press	is	focused	on	that	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 floor 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	put	 carpet 	 ing 	 	in	your	house	,	it	's	about	a	tenth	of	the	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	of	the	entire	house	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	use	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	or	wood	for	a	much	lower	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	.
so	now	we	add	in	the	final	construction	energy	,	we	add	it	all	up	,	and	we	've	built	a	house	for	less	than	half	of	the	typical	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	for	building	a	house	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	before	we	pat	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	too	much	on	the	back	,	we	have	 pour 	 ed 	 	151	megawatt	 hour 	 s 	 	of	energy	 in 	 to 	 	 construct 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	house	when	there	was	a	house	there	before	.
and	so	the	question	is	:	how	could	we	make	that	back	?
and	so	if	i	run	my	new	energy	-	efficient	house	forward	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	the	old	,	non	-	energy	-	efficient	house	,	we	make	it	back	in	about	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	have	 up 	 grad 	 ed 	 	the	old	house	to	be	more	energy	-	efficient	,	and	in	that	case	,	it	would	take	me	more	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	to	break	even	.
now	,	if	i	had	n't	paid	attention	to	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	,	it	would	have	taken	us	over	50	 year 	 s 	 	to	break	even	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	 up 	 grad 	 ed 	 	house	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
on	the	scale	of	my	 port 	 ion 	 	of	the	house	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	about	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	i	drive	in	a	year	,	it	's	about	five	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	if	i	went	 entire 	 ly 	 	 veget 	 arian 	 	.
but	my	elephant	in	the	living	room	flies	.
 clear 	 ly 	 	,	i	need	to	walk	home	from	ted	.
but	all	the	 calcul 	 ations 	 	for	 embodi 	 ed 	 	energy	are	on	the	blog	.
and	,	remember	,	it	's	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	are	not	 expect 	 ing 	 	to	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 change 	 s 	 	that	are	.
thank	you	.
