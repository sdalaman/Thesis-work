these	 rock 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	hitting	our	earth	for	about	three	billion	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	much	of	what	's	gone	on	on	our	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	real	meteorite	,	and	you	can	see	all	the	 melt 	 ing 	 	of	the	iron	from	the	speed	and	the	heat	when	a	meteorite	 hit 	 s 	 	the	earth	,	and	just	how	much	of	it	 surviv 	 es 	 	and	 melt 	 s 	 	.
from	a	meteorite	from	space	,	we	're	over	here	with	an	original	sputnik	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	seven	 surviv 	 ing 	 	sputniks	that	was	not	 launch 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	copy	.
the	space	age	 beg 	 an 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	october	,	and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	sputnik	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
and	it	would	n't	be	 f 	 un 	 	to	talk	about	the	space	age	 with 	 out 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	a	flag	that	was	carried	to	the	moon	and	back	,	on	apollo	11	.
the	 astro 	 nauts 	 	each	got	to	carry	about	ten	silk	 flag 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	personal	 kit 	 s 	 	.
they	would	 br 	 ing 	 	them	back	and	mount	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	carried	to	the	moon	and	back	.
so	that	's	for	 f 	 un 	 	.
the	dawn	of	 book 	 s 	 	is	,	of	course	,	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	it	would	n't	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	talk	about	the	dawn	of	 book 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	copy	of	a	guttenberg	 b 	 ible 	 	.
you	can	see	how	 port 	 able 	 	and	 hand 	 y 	 	it	was	to	have	your	own	guttenberg	but	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	the	guttenberg	 b 	 ible 	 	,	and	the	dawn	of	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	is	not	the	book	.
you	see	,	the	book	was	not	driven	by	 read 	 ing 	 	.
in	1455	,	 no 	 body 	 	could	read	.
so	why	did	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	succeed	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	original	page	of	a	guttenberg	 b 	 ible 	 	.
so	you	're	looking	here	at	one	of	the	first	 print 	 ed 	 	 book 	 s 	 	using	movable	type	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	man	,	550	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	are	living	at	the	age	here	at	the	end	of	the	book	,	where	 electron 	 ic 	 	paper	will	 un 	 doubt 	 ed 	 ly 	 	replace	it	.
but	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	?	here	's	the	quick	story	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	in	the	1450s	,	the	catholic	church	 need 	 ed 	 	money	,	and	so	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	hand	-	wrote	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 indulge 	 nce 	 s 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 forgive 	 ness 	 	's	on	 piece 	 s 	 	of	paper	.
they	 travel 	 ed 	 	all	around	europe	and	 s 	 old 	 	by	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	or	by	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	.
they	got	you	out	of	 pur 	 g 	 atory 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	.
and	when	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	what	they	found	was	they	could	print	 indulge 	 nce 	 s 	 	,	which	was	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	 print 	 ing 	 	money	.
and	so	all	of	western	europe	 start 	 ed 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	 print 	 ing 	 	 press 	 es 	 	in	1455	--	to	print	out	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	single	,	small	 piece 	 s 	 	of	paper	that	got	you	out	of	middle	hell	and	 in 	 to 	 	heaven	.
that	is	why	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	 succeed 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	is	why	martin	luther	 nail 	 ed 	 	his	90	 these 	 s 	 	to	the	door	:	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	 complain 	 ing 	 	that	the	catholic	church	had	gone	 am 	 ok 	 	in	 print 	 ing 	 	out	 indulge 	 nce 	 s 	 	and	selling	them	in	every	town	and	village	and	city	in	all	of	western	europe	.
so	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	was	driven	 entire 	 ly 	 	by	the	 print 	 ing 	 	of	 forgive 	 ness 	 es 	 	and	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 read 	 ing 	 	.
more	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	 picture 	 s 	 	coming	of	the	library	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	that	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	for	 picture 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	have	some	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 show 	 ing 	 	an	object	from	the	stage	i	'm	going	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	special	for	the	first	time	.
we	are	going	to	show	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	the	library	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	ok	?
so	,	i	am	married	to	the	most	 wonder 	 ful 	 	woman	in	the	world	.
you	're	going	to	find	out	why	in	a	minute	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	went	to	see	eileen	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	library	of	human	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
the	room	 it 	 self 	 	is	three	 st 	 ories 	 	tall	.
in	the	glass	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	are	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	of	human	 imagin 	 ation 	 	that	are	computer	controlled	.
the	room	is	a	theatre	.	it	 change 	 s 	 	 color 	 s 	 	.
and	all	 through 	 out 	 	the	library	are	different	 object 	 s 	 	,	different	 space 	 s 	 	.
it	's	designed	like	an	escher	print	.
here	is	some	of	the	lower	level	of	the	library	,	where	the	 exhibit 	 s 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	change	.
you	can	walk	through	.	you	can	touch	.
you	can	see	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 item 	 s 	 	would	fit	in	a	room	.
there	's	my	 ver 	 y 	 	own	saturn	v	.
 every 	 body 	 	should	have	one	,	ok	?
so	you	can	see	here	in	the	lower	level	of	the	library	the	 book 	 s 	 	and	the	 object 	 s 	 	.
in	the	glass	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	is	sort	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
there	is	a	glass	bridge	that	you	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	that	's	 suspend 	 ed 	 	in	space	.
so	it	's	a	leap	of	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
how	do	we	create	?
part	of	the	question	that	i	have	 answer 	 ed 	 	is	,	is	we	create	by	 surround 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	 stimul 	 i 	 	:	with	human	 achiev 	 ement 	 	,	with	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	with	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	drive	us	and	make	us	human	--	the	passionate	 discover 	 y 	 	,	the	 bone 	 s 	 	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	long	gone	,	the	 map 	 s 	 	of	space	that	we	've	 experience 	 d 	 	,	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	the	 hall 	 ways 	 	that	 stimul 	 ate 	 	our	mind	and	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
so	 hope 	 fully 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	i	'll	show	one	or	two	more	 object 	 s 	 	from	the	stage	,	but	for	 to 	 day 	 	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	thank	you	for	all	the	people	that	came	and	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	us	about	it	.
and	eileen	and	i	are	 thrill 	 ed 	 	to	open	our	home	and	share	it	with	the	ted	community	.
ted	is	all	about	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	.
it	's	all	about	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
it	's	all	about	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	before	but	 think 	 ing 	 	about	them	in	ways	that	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	thought	of	them	before	.
and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 discover 	 y 	 	and	 imagin 	 ation 	 	is	all	about	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	can	look	at	a	dna	molecule	model	here	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	us	 re 	 ally 	 	have	ever	 s 	 een 	 	one	,	but	we	know	it	 exist 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	taught	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	.
but	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	look	at	an	enigma	machine	from	the	nazis	in	world	war	ii	that	was	a	 cod 	 ing 	 	and	 de 	 cod 	 ing 	 	machine	.
now	,	you	might	say	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	have	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	code	for	life	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	code	for	death	.
these	two	 molecule 	 s 	 	code	and	decode	.
and	yet	,	looking	at	them	,	you	would	see	a	machine	and	a	molecule	.
but	once	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	them	in	a	new	way	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	both	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	they	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	 prim 	 arily 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	here	.
you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	human	brain	model	,	ok	?
and	it	's	rare	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	never	 re 	 ally 	 	get	to	see	a	brain	.
we	get	to	see	a	skull	.	but	there	it	is	.
all	of	 imagin 	 ation 	 	--	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	think	,	we	feel	,	we	sense	--	 come 	 s 	 	through	the	human	brain	.
and	once	we	create	new	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	,	once	we	shape	the	brain	in	a	new	way	,	it	never	 return 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	original	shape	.
and	i	'll	give	you	a	quick	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
we	think	about	the	 inter 	 net 	 	;	we	think	about	information	that	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	we	never	think	about	the	 hid 	 den 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
but	i	 br 	 ought 	 	 a 	 long 	 	here	a	lump	of	coal	--	right	here	,	one	lump	of	coal	.
and	what	 do 	 es 	 	a	lump	of	coal	have	to	do	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	?
you	see	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	the	energy	in	one	lump	of	coal	to	move	one	 mega 	 byte 	 	of	information	 a 	 cross 	 	the	net	.
so	every	time	you	download	a	file	,	each	 mega 	 byte 	 	is	a	lump	of	coal	.
what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	,	a	200	-	 mega 	 byte 	 	file	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.	ok	?
so	the	next	time	you	download	a	gigabyte	,	or	two	 gigabyte 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	for	free	,	ok	?
the	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	the	energy	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	run	the	web	,	and	to	make	 every 	 thing 	 	we	think	possible	,	possible	.
 thank 	 s 	 	,	chris	.
