i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	journey	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	 mine 	 s 	 	.	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	world	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	,	through	color	and	large	format	 camera 	 s 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 print 	 s 	 	,	to	make	a	body	of	work	that	 some 	 how 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	of	our	use	of	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	how	we	use	the	land	.
and	to	me	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	key	component	that	 some 	 how 	 	,	through	 th 	 is 	 	medium	of	 photograph 	 y 	 	,	which	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	 contempl 	 ate 	 	these	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	that	i	thought	 photograph 	 y 	 	was	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 suit 	 ed 	 	to	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	work	.
and	after	17	 year 	 s 	 	of	 photograph 	 ing 	 	large	industrial	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	oil	is	 under 	 pinning 	 	the	scale	and	speed	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	is	the	speed	at	which	we	're	taking	all	our	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	so	then	i	went	out	to	develop	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	on	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	oil	.
and	what	i	want	to	do	is	to	kind	of	map	an	arc	that	there	is	 extra 	 ction 	 	,	where	we	're	taking	it	from	the	ground	,	 refine 	 ment 	 	.	and	that	's	one	chapter	.
the	other	chapter	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	was	how	we	use	it	--	our	cities	,	our	 car 	 s 	 	,	our	 motor 	 culture 	 s 	 	,	where	people	gather	around	the	vehicle	 a 	 s 	 	a	 celebr 	 ation 	 	.
and	then	the	third	one	is	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	the	end	of	oil	,	 th 	 is 	 	 en 	 tropic 	 	end	,	where	all	of	our	 part 	 s 	 	of	 car 	 s 	 	,	our	 tire 	 s 	 	,	oil	 filter 	 s 	 	,	 helicopter 	 s 	 	,	 plane 	 s 	 	--	where	are	the	 land 	 scapes 	 	where	all	of	that	stuff	 end 	 s 	 	up	?
and	to	me	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 photograph 	 y 	 	was	a	way	in	which	i	could	explore	and	research	the	world	,	and	find	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	idea	that	i	had	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	that	was	 br 	 ought 	 	forward	by	an	ecologist	--	he	 bas 	 ically 	 	did	a	 calcul 	 ation 	 	where	he	took	one	liter	of	gas	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	how	much	carbon	it	would	take	,	and	how	much	 organ 	 ic 	 	material	?
it	was	23	metric	 ton 	 s 	 	for	one	liter	.
so	 when 	 ever 	 	i	fill	up	my	gas	,	i	think	of	that	liter	,	and	how	much	carbon	.
and	i	know	that	oil	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	ocean	and	 phy 	 to 	 plankton 	 	,	but	he	did	the	 calcul 	 ations 	 	for	our	earth	and	what	it	had	to	do	to	produce	that	amount	of	energy	.
from	the	 photo 	 synthetic 	 	growth	,	it	would	take	500	 year 	 s 	 	of	that	growth	to	produce	what	we	use	,	the	30	billion	 barrel 	 s 	 	we	use	per	year	.
and	that	 al 	 so 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	me	to	the	fact	that	 th 	 is 	 	 pose 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	risk	to	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
looking	at	30	billion	per	year	,	we	look	at	our	two	largest	 suppli 	 ers 	 	,	saudi	arabia	and	now	canada	,	with	 it 	 s 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	oil	.
and	together	they	 on 	 ly 	 	form	about	15	 year 	 s 	 	of	supply	.
the	whole	world	,	at	1.2	trillion	 estimate 	 d 	 	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	about	45	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	it	's	not	a	question	of	if	,	but	a	question	of	when	peak	oil	will	come	 up 	 on 	 	us	.
so	,	to	me	,	using	 photograph 	 y 	 	--	and	i	feel	that	all	of	us	need	to	now	begin	to	 re 	 ally 	 	take	the	task	of	using	our	 talent 	 s 	 	,	our	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	,	to	begin	to	deal	with	what	i	think	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	most	 challeng 	 ing 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	of	our	time	,	how	to	deal	with	our	energy	crisis	.
and	i	would	like	to	say	that	,	on	the	other	side	of	it	,	30	,	40	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	the	children	that	i	have	,	i	can	look	at	them	and	say	,	``	we	did	 every 	 thing 	 	we	possibly	,	 human 	 ly 	 	could	do	,	to	begin	to	 mitig 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	i	feel	is	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	and	critical	 moment 	 s 	 	in	our	time	.	thank	you	.
