why	grow	 home 	 s 	 	?	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	.
right	now	,	america	is	in	an	 un 	 re 	 mitt 	 ing 	 	state	of	trauma	.
and	there	's	a	cause	for	that	,	all	right	.
we	've	got	mcpeople	,	mccars	,	mchouses	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	,	i	have	to	confront	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	what	's	a	technology	that	will	allow	us	to	make	 gi 	 norm 	 ous 	 	 house 	 s 	 	?
well	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	2,500	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 ple 	 ach 	 ing 	 	,	or	 graft 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	together	,	or	 graft 	 ing 	 	 in 	 osc 	 ulate 	 	matter	 in 	 to 	 	one	 con 	 t 	 ig 	 uous 	 	,	vascular	system	.
and	we	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	than	what	we	did	in	the	past	;	we	add	kind	of	a	 mod 	 ic 	 um 	 	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	to	that	.
we	use	cnc	to	make	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	to	train	semi	-	epithetic	matter	,	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	specific	 geo 	 metry 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	a	home	that	we	call	a	fab	tree	hab	.
it	 fit 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	environment	.	it	is	the	environment	.
it	is	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	right	?
and	you	can	have	a	hundred	million	of	these	 home 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	great	 be 	 cause 	 	they	suck	carbon	.
they	're	perfect	.
you	can	have	100	million	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	or	take	 thing 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 suburb 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	 home 	 s 	 	that	are	a	part	of	the	environment	.
imagine	pre	-	growing	a	village	--	it	 take 	 s 	 	about	seven	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	--	and	 every 	 thing 	 	is	green	.
so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	we	do	the	veggie	house	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	do	the	in	-	vitro	meat	 habit 	 at 	 	,	or	 home 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	research	on	now	in	brooklyn	,	where	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 architect 	 ure 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	,	we	're	for	the	first	of	 it 	 s 	 	kind	to	put	in	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	cell	biology	lab	and	start	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	and	tissue	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	the	future	would	be	if	 architect 	 ure 	 	and	biology	 be 	 came 	 	one	.
so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	our	lab	.
and	what	we	do	is	we	grow	 extra 	 cellular 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	from	 pig 	 s 	 	.
we	use	a	 modifi 	 ed 	 	 ink 	 jet 	 	 print 	 er 	 	,	and	we	print	 geo 	 metry 	 	.
we	print	 geo 	 metry 	 	where	we	can	make	industrial	design	 object 	 s 	 	like	,	you	know	,	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	leather	 belt 	 s 	 	,	 hand 	 bag 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	where	no	 senti 	 ent 	 	creature	is	 harm 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 victim 	 less 	 	.	it	's	meat	from	a	test	tube	.
so	our	 theor 	 y 	 	is	that	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	we	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	 home 	 s 	 	.
so	here	is	a	typical	stud	wall	,	an	 architect 	 ural 	 	construction	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	section	of	our	proposal	for	a	meat	house	,	where	you	can	see	we	use	fatty	 cell 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 insula 	 tion 	 	,	 cili 	 a 	 	for	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	wind	 load 	 s 	 	and	 sphinc 	 ter 	 	 muscle 	 s 	 	for	the	 door 	 s 	 	and	 window 	 s 	 	.
and	we	know	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	.
it	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	an	english	tudor	or	spanish	colonial	,	but	we	kind	of	chose	 th 	 is 	 	shape	.
and	there	it	is	kind	of	grown	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	 part 	 icular 	 	section	of	it	.
we	had	a	big	show	in	prague	,	and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	put	it	in	front	of	the	 cat 	 hedral 	 	so	 relig 	 ion 	 	can	confront	the	house	of	meat	.
that	's	why	we	grow	 home 	 s 	 	.	 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
