i	want	to	start	my	talk	 to 	 day 	 	with	two	 observ 	 ations 	 	about	the	human	species	.
the	first	 observ 	 ation 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	might	think	is	 quit 	 e 	 	obvious	,	and	that	's	that	our	species	,	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	--	like	,	 ridicul 	 ously 	 	smart	--	like	you	're	all	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	no	other	species	on	the	planet	 do 	 es 	 	right	now	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	not	the	first	time	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
of	course	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	smart	,	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 va 	 in 	 	species	.
so	we	like	 point 	 ing 	 	out	the	fact	that	we	're	smart	.
you	know	,	so	i	could	turn	to	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	any	 s 	 age 	 	from	shakespeare	to	stephen	colbert	to	point	out	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	fact	that	we	're	noble	in	reason	and	infinite	in	 facul 	 ties 	 	and	just	kind	of	awesome	-	er	than	 any 	 thing 	 	else	on	the	planet	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	all	 thing 	 s 	 	cerebral	.
but	of	course	,	there	's	a	second	 observ 	 ation 	 	about	the	human	species	that	i	want	to	focus	on	a	little	bit	more	,	and	that	's	the	fact	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	smart	,	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	dumb	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	some	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	our	decision	making	.
now	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 smirk 	 s 	 	out	there	.
do	n't	worry	,	i	'm	not	going	to	call	 any 	 one 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	out	on	any	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	your	own	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
but	of	course	,	just	in	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	we	see	these	unprecedented	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	human	 ine 	 pt 	 itude 	 	.
and	we	've	 watch 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 tool 	 s 	 	we	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	make	to	pull	the	 resource 	 s 	 	out	of	our	environment	kind	of	just	blow	up	in	our	face	.
we	've	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	financial	 market 	 s 	 	that	we	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	create	--	these	 market 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 fool 	 proof 	 	--	we	've	 watch 	 ed 	 	them	kind	of	collapse	before	our	 eye 	 s 	 	.
but	both	of	these	two	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	do	n't	 high 	 light 	 	what	i	think	is	most	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	about	the	 mistak 	 es 	 	that	 human 	 s 	 	make	,	which	is	that	we	'd	like	to	think	that	the	 mistak 	 es 	 	we	make	are	 re 	 ally 	 	just	the	result	of	a	couple	bad	 apple 	 s 	 	or	a	couple	 re 	 ally 	 	sort	of	fail	blog	-	worthy	 decision 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	what	social	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	that	most	of	us	,	when	put	in	certain	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	,	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
the	 error 	 s 	 	we	make	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
we	make	them	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	to	 lot 	 s 	 	of	evidence	.
when	we	get	negative	 feed 	 back 	 	,	we	still	,	the	next	time	we	're	face	with	a	certain	 con 	 text 	 	,	tend	to	make	the	same	 error 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	real	 puzzl 	 e 	 	to	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	scholar	of	human	nature	.
what	i	'm	most	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	is	,	how	is	a	species	that	's	 a 	 s 	 	smart	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 s 	 uch 	 	bad	and	 s 	 uch 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 	 error 	 s 	 	all	the	time	?
you	know	,	we	're	the	 smart 	 est 	 	thing	out	there	,	why	ca	n't	we	figure	 th 	 is 	 	out	?
in	some	sense	,	where	do	our	 mistak 	 es 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	come	from	?
and	 hav 	 ing 	 	thought	about	 th 	 is 	 	a	little	bit	,	i	see	a	couple	different	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
one	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	,	in	some	sense	,	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	our	fault	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	a	smart	species	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 environment 	 s 	 	that	are	super	,	super	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	too	 complic 	 ated 	 	for	us	to	even	 actual 	 ly 	 	understand	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	them	.
we	create	financial	 market 	 s 	 	that	are	super	complex	.
we	create	mortgage	 term 	 s 	 	that	we	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	deal	with	.
and	of	course	,	if	we	are	put	in	 environment 	 s 	 	where	we	ca	n't	deal	with	it	,	in	some	sense	 make 	 s 	 	sense	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	might	mess	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	up	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	case	,	we	'd	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	solution	to	the	problem	of	human	error	.
we	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	say	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	let	's	figure	out	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	we	ca	n't	deal	with	,	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 environment 	 s 	 	that	are	bad	--	get	rid	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	design	 thing 	 s 	 	better	,	and	we	should	be	the	noble	species	that	we	expect	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	be	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	i	find	a	little	bit	more	 worry 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	not	our	 environment 	 s 	 	that	are	 mess 	 ed 	 	up	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	us	that	's	designed	 bad 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	hint	that	i	've	gotten	from	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	ways	that	social	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	human	 error 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	see	is	that	people	tend	to	keep	making	 error 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	,	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	we	might	 al 	 most 	 	just	be	built	to	make	 error 	 s 	 	in	certain	ways	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	i	worry	a	little	bit	more	about	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	it	's	us	that	's	 mess 	 ed 	 	up	,	it	's	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	clear	how	we	go	about	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	it	.
we	might	just	have	to	accept	the	fact	that	we	're	error	prone	and	try	to	design	 thing 	 s 	 	around	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	question	my	 student 	 s 	 	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	at	.
how	can	we	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 possibil 	 ity 	 	one	and	 possibil 	 ity 	 	two	?
what	we	need	is	a	population	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	smart	,	can	make	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 decision 	 s 	 	,	but	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	access	to	any	of	the	 system 	 s 	 	we	have	,	any	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	might	mess	us	up	--	no	human	technology	,	human	culture	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	not	human	language	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	we	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	these	 guy 	 s 	 	here	.
these	are	one	of	the	 guy 	 s 	 	i	work	with	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 brow 	 n 	 	 cap 	 uch 	 in 	 	monkey	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	new	world	 prim 	 ates 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	broke	off	from	the	human	branch	about	35	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	your	great	,	great	,	great	great	,	great	,	great	--	with	about	five	million	``	 great 	 s 	 	``	in	there	--	 grand 	 mother 	 	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	same	great	,	great	,	great	,	great	 grand 	 mother 	 	with	five	million	``	 great 	 s 	 	``	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	holly	up	here	.
you	know	,	so	you	can	take	comfort	in	the	fact	that	 th 	 is 	 	guy	up	here	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 di 	 stant 	 	,	but	albeit	 evolution 	 ary 	 	,	 relat 	 ive 	 	.
the	good	news	about	holly	 th 	 ough 	 	is	that	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	we	do	.
you	know	,	she	's	a	smart	,	 ver 	 y 	 	cut	creature	,	a	 prim 	 ate 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	but	she	 lack 	 s 	 	all	the	stuff	we	think	might	be	 mess 	 ing 	 	us	up	.
so	she	's	the	perfect	test	case	.
what	if	we	put	holly	 in 	 to 	 	the	same	 con 	 text 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	?
 do 	 es 	 	she	make	the	same	 mistak 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	us	?
 do 	 es 	 	she	not	learn	from	them	?	and	so	on	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	thing	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	.
my	 student 	 s 	 	and	i	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	all	right	,	let	's	,	you	know	,	throw	so	 problem 	 s 	 	at	holly	,	see	if	she	 mess 	 es 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	up	.
first	problem	is	just	,	well	,	where	should	we	start	?
 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	it	's	great	for	us	,	but	bad	for	 human 	 s 	 	.
we	make	a	lot	of	 mistak 	 es 	 	in	a	lot	of	different	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	where	are	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	around	the	time	of	the	financial	collapse	,	around	the	time	when	 fore 	 closure 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	hitting	the	news	,	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 h 	 hmm 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	in	the	financial	domain	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	should	look	at	monkey	's	economic	 decision 	 s 	 	and	try	to	see	if	they	do	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	dumb	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	.
of	course	,	that	's	when	we	hit	a	sort	second	problem	--	a	little	bit	more	 method 	 o 	 logical 	 	--	which	is	that	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	 guy 	 s 	 	do	n't	know	,	but	 monkey 	 s 	 	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	money	.	i	know	,	you	have	n't	met	them	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	,	you	know	,	they	're	not	in	the	queue	 be 	 hind 	 	you	at	the	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	or	the	atm	--	you	know	,	they	do	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
so	now	we	 face 	 d 	 	,	you	know	,	a	little	bit	of	a	problem	here	.
how	are	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	ask	 monkey 	 s 	 	about	money	if	they	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	it	?
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	just	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	suck	it	up	and	teach	 monkey 	 s 	 	how	to	use	money	.
so	that	's	just	what	we	did	.
what	you	're	looking	at	over	here	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	first	unit	that	i	know	of	of	non	-	human	 curr 	 ency 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	creative	at	the	time	we	 start 	 ed 	 	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	so	we	just	 call 	 ed 	 	it	a	 to 	 ken 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	unit	of	 curr 	 ency 	 	that	we	've	taught	our	 monkey 	 s 	 	at	yale	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	with	 human 	 s 	 	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	buy	different	 piece 	 s 	 	of	food	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	much	--	in	fact	,	it	is	n't	like	much	.
like	most	of	our	money	,	it	's	just	a	piece	of	metal	.
 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	've	taken	 curr 	 encies 	 	home	from	your	trip	know	,	once	you	get	home	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 use 	 less 	 	.
it	was	 use 	 less 	 	to	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	at	first	before	they	 real 	 ized 	 	what	they	could	do	with	it	.
when	we	first	 g 	 ave 	 	it	to	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 en 	 closure 	 s 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	 pick 	 ed 	 	them	up	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	them	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	these	kind	of	weird	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	they	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	hand	these	 to 	 ken 	 s 	 	over	to	different	 human 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	for	some	food	.
and	so	you	see	one	of	our	 monkey 	 s 	 	,	mayday	,	up	here	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	and	b	are	kind	of	the	 point 	 s 	 	where	she	's	sort	of	a	little	bit	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	hand	from	a	human	 experiment 	 er 	 	,	and	mayday	 quick 	 ly 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	out	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	the	human	 want 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 hand 	 s 	 	it	over	,	and	then	 get 	 s 	 	some	food	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	not	just	mayday	,	all	of	our	 monkey 	 s 	 	get	good	at	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ken 	 s 	 	with	human	 sale 	 s 	 man 	 	.
so	here	's	just	a	quick	video	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
here	's	mayday	.	she	's	going	to	be	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	a	 to 	 ken 	 	for	some	food	and	 wait 	 ing 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	her	food	.
here	's	felix	,	i	think	.	he	's	our	alpha	male	;	he	's	a	kind	of	big	guy	.
but	he	too	 wait 	 s 	 	 patient 	 ly 	 	,	 get 	 s 	 	his	food	and	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
so	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	get	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	're	 surprising 	 ly 	 	good	at	 th 	 is 	 	with	 ver 	 y 	 	little	training	.
we	just	 allow 	 ed 	 	them	to	pick	 th 	 is 	 	up	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
the	question	is	:	is	 th 	 is 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	human	money	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	a	market	at	all	,	or	did	we	just	do	a	weird	 psycho 	 logist 	 	's	trick	by	 get 	 ting 	 	 monkey 	 s 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	looking	smart	,	but	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	smart	.
and	so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	what	would	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	 spontane 	 ously 	 	do	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 curr 	 ency 	 	,	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	using	it	like	money	?
well	,	you	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	imagine	them	to	do	all	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	smart	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 human 	 s 	 	do	when	they	start	 ex 	 changing 	 	money	with	each	other	.
you	might	have	them	start	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	price	,	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	how	much	they	buy	--	sort	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	track	of	 the 	 ir 	 	monkey	 to 	 ken 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	.
do	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	do	 any 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	so	our	monkey	 market 	 place 	 	was	born	.
the	way	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	is	that	our	 monkey 	 s 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	live	in	a	kind	of	big	zoo	social	 en 	 closure 	 	.
when	they	get	a	 han 	 ker 	 ing 	 	for	some	 treat 	 s 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	them	a	way	out	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	 small 	 er 	 	 en 	 closure 	 	where	they	could	enter	the	market	.
 up 	 on 	 	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	market	--	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	much	more	 f 	 un 	 	market	for	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	than	most	human	 market 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	door	of	the	market	,	a	human	would	give	them	a	big	wallet	full	of	 to 	 ken 	 s 	 	so	they	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	trade	the	 to 	 ken 	 s 	 	with	one	of	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	here	--	two	different	possible	human	 sale 	 s 	 men 	 	that	they	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	buy	stuff	from	.
the	 sale 	 s 	 men 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 student 	 s 	 	from	my	lab	.
they	 dress 	 ed 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	different	people	.
and	over	time	,	they	did	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	same	thing	so	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	could	learn	,	you	know	,	who	 s 	 old 	 	what	at	what	price	--	you	know	,	who	was	 reli 	 able 	 	,	who	was	n't	,	and	so	on	.
and	you	can	see	that	each	of	the	 experiment 	 ers 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	up	a	little	,	yellow	food	dish	.
and	that	's	what	the	monkey	can	for	a	single	 to 	 ken 	 	.
so	 every 	 thing 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	one	 to 	 ken 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 to 	 ken 	 s 	 	buy	more	than	 other 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	more	 grape 	 s 	 	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'll	show	you	a	quick	video	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	 market 	 place 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
here	's	a	monkey	-	eye	-	view	.	 monkey 	 s 	 	are	 short 	 er 	 	,	so	it	's	a	little	short	.
but	here	's	honey	.
she	's	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	market	to	open	a	little	 im 	 patient 	 ly 	 	.
all	of	a	sudden	the	market	 open 	 s 	 	.	here	's	her	choice	:	one	 grape 	 s 	 	or	two	 grape 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	honey	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	market	economist	,	 go 	 es 	 	with	the	guy	who	 give 	 s 	 	more	.
she	could	teach	our	financial	 advise 	 rs 	 	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	or	two	.
so	not	just	honey	,	most	of	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	went	with	 guy 	 s 	 	who	had	more	.
most	of	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	went	with	 guy 	 s 	 	who	had	better	food	.
when	we	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 sale 	 s 	 	,	we	saw	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	paid	attention	to	that	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	 car 	 ed 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	monkey	 to 	 ken 	 	dollar	.
the	more	surprising	thing	was	that	when	we	 collabor 	 ated 	 	with	 economist 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	'	data	using	economic	 tool 	 s 	 	,	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	 match 	 ed 	 	,	not	just	 qual 	 itative 	 ly 	 	,	but	 quant 	 itative 	 ly 	 	with	what	we	saw	 human 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	a	real	market	.
so	much	so	that	,	if	you	saw	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	'	 number 	 s 	 	,	you	could	n't	tell	 whet 	 her 	 	they	came	from	a	monkey	or	a	human	in	the	same	market	.
and	what	we	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	we	'd	 d 	 one 	 	is	like	we	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	and	us	,	 work 	 s 	 	like	a	real	financial	 curr 	 ency 	 	.
question	is	:	do	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	start	 mess 	 ing 	 	up	in	the	same	ways	we	do	?
well	,	we	 al 	 ready 	 	saw	 anecdotal 	 ly 	 	a	couple	of	 sign 	 s 	 	that	they	might	.
one	thing	we	never	saw	in	the	monkey	 market 	 place 	 	was	any	evidence	of	saving	--	you	know	,	just	like	our	own	species	.
the	 monkey 	 s 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	market	,	 s 	 pent 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	budget	and	then	went	back	to	 every 	 one 	 	else	.
the	other	thing	we	 al 	 so 	 	 spontane 	 ously 	 	saw	,	 embarrass 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	is	 spontane 	 ous 	 	evidence	of	larceny	.
the	 monkey 	 s 	 	would	rip	-	off	the	 to 	 ken 	 s 	 	at	every	 avail 	 able 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	--	from	each	other	,	often	from	us	--	you	know	,	 thing 	 s 	 	we	did	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	think	we	 we 	 re 	 	 introduc 	 ing 	 	,	but	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 spontane 	 ously 	 	saw	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	bad	.
can	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	if	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	dumb	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	do	?
one	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	just	kind	of	let	the	monkey	financial	system	play	out	,	you	know	,	see	if	they	start	 call 	 ing 	 	us	for	 bail 	 out 	 s 	 	in	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	a	little	 im 	 patient 	 	so	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	sort	of	speed	 thing 	 s 	 	up	a	bit	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	let	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	give	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 human 	 s 	 	tend	to	get	wrong	in	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	economic	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	or	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	economic	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	since	the	best	way	to	see	how	people	go	wrong	is	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	give	you	 guy 	 s 	 	a	quick	experiment	to	sort	of	watch	your	own	financial	 intuit 	 ions 	 	in	action	.
so	imagine	that	right	now	i	 hand 	 ed 	 	each	and	every	one	of	you	a	thousand	u.s.	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	so	10	crisp	hundred	dollar	 bill 	 s 	 	.
take	these	,	put	it	in	your	wallet	and	 s 	 pend 	 	a	second	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	you	're	going	to	do	with	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 your 	 s 	 	now	;	you	can	buy	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	.
 don 	 ate 	 	it	,	take	it	,	and	so	on	.
 sound 	 s 	 	great	,	but	you	get	one	more	choice	to	earn	a	little	bit	more	money	.
and	here	's	your	choice	:	you	can	either	be	 risk 	 y 	 	,	in	which	case	i	'm	going	to	flip	one	of	these	monkey	 to 	 ken 	 s 	 	.
if	it	 come 	 s 	 	up	 head 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	to	get	a	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	more	.
if	it	 come 	 s 	 	up	 tail 	 s 	 	,	you	get	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
so	it	's	a	chance	to	get	more	,	but	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 risk 	 y 	 	.
your	other	option	is	a	bit	safe	.	your	just	going	to	get	some	money	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.
i	'm	just	going	to	give	you	500	 buck 	 s 	 	.
you	can	stick	it	in	your	wallet	and	use	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
so	see	what	your	 intuit 	 ion 	 	is	here	.
most	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	with	the	play	-	it	-	safe	option	.
most	people	say	,	why	should	i	be	 risk 	 y 	 	when	i	can	get	1,500	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	 s 	 ure 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	like	a	good	bet	.	i	'm	going	to	go	with	that	.
you	might	say	,	eh	,	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	irrational	.
people	are	a	little	risk	-	 a 	 verse 	 	.	so	what	?
well	,	the	``	so	what	?	``	 come 	 s 	 	when	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	same	problem	set	up	just	a	little	bit	 different 	 ly 	 	.
so	now	imagine	that	i	give	each	and	every	one	of	you	2,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	20	crisp	hundred	dollar	 bill 	 s 	 	.
now	you	can	buy	double	to	stuff	you	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	get	before	.
think	about	how	you	'd	feel	 stick 	 ing 	 	it	in	your	wallet	.
and	now	imagine	that	i	have	you	make	 an 	 other 	 	choice	but	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	it	's	a	little	bit	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
now	,	you	're	going	to	be	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	how	you	're	going	to	lose	money	,	but	you	're	going	to	get	the	same	choice	.
you	can	either	take	a	 risk 	 y 	 	loss	--	so	i	'll	flip	a	 co 	 in 	 	.	if	it	 come 	 s 	 	up	 head 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	lose	a	lot	.
if	it	 come 	 s 	 	up	 tail 	 s 	 	,	you	lose	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	you	're	fine	,	get	to	keep	the	whole	thing	--	or	you	could	play	it	safe	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	you	have	to	reach	back	 in 	 to 	 	your	wallet	and	give	me	five	of	 t 	 hose 	 	$	100	 bill 	 s 	 	,	for	certain	.
and	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 fur 	 row 	 ed 	 	 brow 	 s 	 	out	there	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	same	 intuit 	 ions 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 subject 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	tested	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	when	 present 	 ed 	 	with	these	 option 	 s 	 	,	people	do	n't	 choos 	 e 	 	to	play	it	safe	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	tend	to	go	a	little	 risk 	 y 	 	.
the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	is	irrational	is	that	we	've	 give 	 n 	 	people	in	both	 situ 	 ations 	 	the	same	choice	.
it	's	a	50/50	shot	of	a	thousand	or	2,000	,	or	just	1,500	 dollar 	 s 	 	with	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
but	people	's	 intuit 	 ions 	 	about	how	much	risk	to	take	 varie 	 s 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	where	they	 start 	 ed 	 	with	.
so	what	's	going	on	?
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	the	result	of	at	 l 	 east 	 	two	 bias 	 es 	 	that	we	have	at	the	 psycho 	 logical 	 	level	.
one	is	that	we	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	time	 think 	 ing 	 	in	absolute	 term 	 s 	 	.
you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	do	work	to	figure	out	,	well	,	one	option	's	a	thousand	,	2,000	;	one	is	1,500	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	find	it	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	think	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	 term 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 option 	 s 	 	change	from	one	time	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	we	think	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	'm	going	to	get	more	,	``	or	``	oh	,	i	'm	going	to	get	less	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	well	and	good	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	 change 	 s 	 	in	different	 direction 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	effect	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	we	think	 option 	 s 	 	are	good	or	not	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	the	second	bias	,	which	 economist 	 s 	 	have	 call 	 ed 	 	loss	 a 	 version 	 	.
the	idea	is	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	hate	it	when	 thing 	 s 	 	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	red	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	hate	it	when	we	have	to	lose	out	on	some	money	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 witch 	 	our	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	to	avoid	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	you	saw	in	that	last	scenario	is	that	 subject 	 s 	 	get	 risk 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	the	small	shot	that	there	wo	n't	be	any	loss	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	when	we	're	in	a	risk	 mind 	 set 	 	--	excuse	me	,	when	we	're	in	a	loss	 mind 	 set 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	more	 risk 	 y 	 	,	which	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 	.
these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	play	out	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	bad	ways	in	 human 	 s 	 	.
they	're	why	stock	 invest 	 ors 	 	hold	onto	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 stock 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 evalu 	 ating 	 	them	in	 relat 	 ive 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
they	're	why	people	in	the	housing	market	 re 	 fused 	 	to	sell	 the 	 ir 	 	house	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	want	to	sell	at	a	loss	.
the	question	we	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	 whet 	 her 	 	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	show	the	same	 bias 	 es 	 	.
if	we	set	up	 t 	 hose 	 	same	 scenario 	 s 	 	in	our	little	monkey	market	,	would	they	do	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	people	?
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	did	,	we	 g 	 ave 	 	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	between	 guy 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	safe	--	they	did	the	same	thing	every	time	--	or	 guy 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 risk 	 y 	 	--	they	did	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	half	the	time	.
and	then	we	 g 	 ave 	 	them	 option 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 bon 	 uses 	 	--	like	you	 guy 	 s 	 	did	in	the	first	scenario	--	so	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	chance	more	,	or	 piece 	 s 	 	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	--	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	get	more	than	they	 re 	 ally 	 	got	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
we	 introduc 	 ed 	 	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	to	two	new	monkey	 sale 	 s 	 men 	 	.
the	guy	on	the	left	and	right	both	start	with	one	piece	of	grape	,	so	it	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
but	they	're	going	to	give	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	 bon 	 uses 	 	.
the	guy	on	the	left	is	a	safe	 bon 	 us 	 	.
all	the	time	,	he	 add 	 s 	 	one	,	to	give	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	two	.
the	guy	on	the	right	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 risk 	 y 	 	 bon 	 us 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	get	no	 bon 	 us 	 	--	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 bon 	 us 	 	of	zero	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	get	two	extra	.
for	a	big	 bon 	 us 	 	,	now	they	get	three	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	choice	you	 guy 	 s 	 	just	 face 	 d 	 	.
do	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	to	play	it	safe	and	then	go	with	the	guy	who	's	going	to	do	the	same	thing	on	every	trial	,	or	do	they	want	to	be	 risk 	 y 	 	and	try	to	get	a	 risk 	 y 	 	,	but	big	,	 bon 	 us 	 	,	but	risk	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	no	 bon 	 us 	 	.
people	here	 play 	 ed 	 	it	safe	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	play	it	safe	too	.
 qual 	 itative 	 ly 	 	and	 quant 	 itative 	 ly 	 	,	they	 choos 	 e 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	people	,	when	tested	in	the	same	thing	.
you	might	say	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	just	do	n't	like	risk	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	should	see	how	they	do	with	 loss 	 es 	 	.
and	so	we	ran	a	second	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	meet	two	 guy 	 s 	 	who	are	n't	giving	them	 bon 	 uses 	 	;	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	giving	them	less	than	they	expect	.
so	they	look	like	they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	out	with	a	big	amount	.
these	are	three	 grape 	 s 	 	;	the	monkey	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 psych 	 ed 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	now	they	learn	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	going	to	give	them	less	than	they	expect	.
they	guy	on	the	left	is	a	safe	loss	.
every	single	time	,	he	's	going	to	take	one	of	these	away	and	give	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	just	two	.
the	guy	on	the	right	is	the	 risk 	 y 	 	loss	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	he	 give 	 s 	 	no	loss	,	so	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 psych 	 ed 	 	,	but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 give 	 s 	 	a	big	loss	,	taking	away	two	to	give	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	.
and	so	what	do	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	do	?
 aga 	 in 	 	,	same	choice	;	they	can	play	it	safe	for	 al 	 ways 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	two	 grape 	 s 	 	every	single	time	,	or	they	can	take	a	 risk 	 y 	 	bet	and	 choos 	 e 	 	between	one	and	three	.
the	 remark 	 able 	 	thing	to	us	is	that	,	when	you	give	 monkey 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	choice	,	they	do	the	same	irrational	thing	that	people	do	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	more	 risk 	 y 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	the	 experiment 	 ers 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	crazy	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	too	are	 evalu 	 ating 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 relat 	 ive 	 	 term 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 treat 	 ing 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	than	they	treat	 gain 	 s 	 	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
well	,	what	we	've	 show 	 n 	 	is	that	,	first	of	all	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	give	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	a	financial	 curr 	 ency 	 	,	and	they	do	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 thing 	 s 	 	with	it	.
they	do	some	of	the	smart	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	,	some	of	the	kind	of	not	so	nice	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	,	like	steal	it	and	so	on	.
but	they	 al 	 so 	 	do	some	of	the	irrational	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	.
they	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	get	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	and	in	the	same	ways	that	we	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	take	-	home	 mess 	 age 	 	of	the	talk	,	which	is	that	if	you	saw	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	you	thought	,	oh	,	i	'm	 total 	 ly 	 	going	to	go	home	and	hire	a	 cap 	 uch 	 in 	 	monkey	financial	 advise 	 r 	 	.
they	're	way	 cut 	 er 	 	than	the	one	at	...	you	know	--	do	n't	do	that	;	they	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	be	just	 a 	 s 	 	dumb	 a 	 s 	 	the	human	one	you	 al 	 ready 	 	have	.
so	,	you	know	,	a	little	bad	--	sorry	,	sorry	,	sorry	.
a	little	bad	for	monkey	 invest 	 ors 	 	.
but	of	course	,	you	know	,	the	reason	you	're	 laugh 	 ing 	 	is	bad	for	 human 	 s 	 	too	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 answer 	 ed 	 	the	question	we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	where	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 error 	 s 	 	came	from	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	hope	that	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	sort	of	tweak	our	financial	 institution 	 s 	 	,	tweak	our	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	make	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	better	.
but	what	we	've	learn	is	that	these	 bias 	 es 	 	might	be	a	 deep 	 er 	 	part	of	us	than	that	.
in	fact	,	they	might	be	due	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	of	our	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
you	know	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	not	just	 human 	 s 	 	at	the	right	side	of	 th 	 is 	 	chain	that	's	duncey	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	sort	of	duncey	all	the	way	back	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	we	 believ 	 e 	 	the	 cap 	 uch 	 in 	 	monkey	 result 	 s 	 	,	 mean 	 s 	 	that	these	duncey	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	might	be	35	million	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
that	's	a	long	time	for	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	to	 potential 	 ly 	 	get	 change 	 d 	 	around	--	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	old	.
what	do	we	know	about	other	old	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	one	thing	we	know	is	that	they	tend	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	 over 	 come 	 	.
you	know	,	think	of	our	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 pre 	 d 	 ile 	 ction 	 	for	eating	sweet	 thing 	 s 	 	,	fatty	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 cheese 	 cake 	 	.
you	ca	n't	just	shut	that	off	.
you	ca	n't	just	look	at	the	dessert	cart	 a 	 s 	 	say	,	``	no	,	no	,	no	.	that	 look 	 s 	 	 disgust 	 ing 	 	to	me	.	``
we	're	just	built	 different 	 ly 	 	.
we	're	going	to	perceive	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	good	thing	to	go	after	.
my	guess	is	that	the	same	thing	is	going	to	be	true	when	 human 	 s 	 	are	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	different	financial	 decision 	 s 	 	.
when	you	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	 stock 	 s 	 	plummet	 in 	 to 	 	the	red	,	when	you	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	house	price	go	down	,	you	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	see	that	in	 any 	 thing 	 	but	old	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 bias 	 es 	 	that	lead	 invest 	 ors 	 	to	do	 bad 	 ly 	 	,	that	lead	to	the	 fore 	 closure 	 	crisis	are	going	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	 over 	 come 	 	.
so	that	's	the	bad	news	.	the	question	is	:	is	there	any	good	news	?
i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	up	here	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	the	good	news	.
well	,	the	good	news	,	i	think	,	is	what	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	talk	,	which	is	that	 human 	 s 	 	are	not	 on 	 ly 	 	smart	;	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 inspiration 	 ally 	 	smart	to	the	rest	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	.
we	're	so	good	at	 over 	 coming 	 	our	 bio 	 logical 	 	 limit 	 ations 	 	--	you	know	,	i	flew	over	here	in	an	 air 	 plane 	 	.
i	did	n't	have	to	try	to	flap	my	 wing 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	contact	 lens 	 es 	 	now	so	that	i	can	see	all	of	you	.
i	do	n't	have	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	my	own	near	-	sightedness	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	all	of	these	 case 	 s 	 	where	we	 over 	 come 	 	our	 bio 	 logical 	 	 limit 	 ations 	 	through	technology	and	other	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
but	we	have	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	we	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 limit 	 ations 	 	.
and	here	's	the	rub	.
it	was	camus	who	once	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	man	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	species	who	 re 	 fuse 	 s 	 	to	be	what	he	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.	``
but	the	 iron 	 y 	 	is	that	it	might	 on 	 ly 	 	be	in	 recogn 	 izing 	 	our	 limit 	 ations 	 	that	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 over 	 come 	 	them	.
the	hope	is	that	you	all	will	think	about	your	 limit 	 ations 	 	,	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 un 	 over 	 com 	 able 	 	,	but	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	them	,	accept	them	and	then	use	the	world	of	design	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	figure	them	out	.
that	might	be	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	we	will	 re 	 ally 	 	be	able	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	our	own	human	potential	and	 re 	 ally 	 	be	the	noble	species	we	hope	to	all	be	.
thank	you	.
