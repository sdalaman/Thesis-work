i	think	i	'll	start	out	and	just	talk	a	little	bit	about	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	 aut 	 ism 	 	is	.
 aut 	 ism 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 continu 	 um 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	from	 ver 	 y 	 	severe	--	the	child	 remain 	 s 	 	non	-	verbal	--	all	the	way	up	to	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	at	home	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	 aut 	 ism 	 	 genetic 	 s 	 	here	.
you	would	n't	have	any	...
it	's	a	 continu 	 um 	 	of	 trait 	 s 	 	.
when	 do 	 es 	 	a	nerd	turn	 in 	 to 	 	asperger	,	which	is	just	mild	 aut 	 ism 	 	?
i	mean	,	einstein	and	mozart	and	tesla	would	all	be	 prob 	 ably 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 aut 	 istic 	 	spectrum	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	concern	me	is	 get 	 ting 	 	these	 kid 	 s 	 	to	be	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	invent	the	next	energy	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	that	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
ok	.	now	,	if	you	want	to	understand	 aut 	 ism 	 	,	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	to	talk	to	you	now	about	different	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
you	have	to	get	away	from	verbal	language	.
i	think	in	 picture 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	think	in	language	.
now	,	the	thing	about	the	 aut 	 istic 	 	mind	is	it	 attend 	 s 	 	to	 detail 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	test	where	you	either	have	to	pick	out	the	big	 letter 	 s 	 	,	or	pick	out	the	little	 letter 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 aut 	 istic 	 	mind	 pick 	 s 	 	out	the	little	 letter 	 s 	 	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	thing	is	,	the	normal	brain	 ignor 	 es 	 	the	 detail 	 s 	 	.
well	,	if	you	're	building	a	bridge	,	 detail 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	fall	down	if	you	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	 detail 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	my	big	 concern 	 s 	 	with	a	lot	of	policy	 thing 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	too	abstract	.
people	are	 get 	 ting 	 	away	from	 do 	 ing 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	stuff	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	that	a	lot	of	the	 school 	 s 	 	have	taken	out	the	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	 class 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	art	,	and	 class 	 es 	 	like	that	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 class 	 es 	 	where	i	 excel 	 led 	 	.
in	my	work	with	cattle	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	a	lot	of	little	 thing 	 s 	 	that	most	people	do	n't	notice	would	make	the	cattle	balk	.	like	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	flag	 wav 	 ing 	 	,	right	in	front	of	the	 veterin 	 ary 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	feed	yard	was	going	to	tear	down	 the 	 ir 	 	whole	 veterin 	 ary 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	;	all	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	move	the	flag	.
rapid	 move 	 ment 	 	,	contrast	.
in	the	early	'70s	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	,	i	got	right	down	in	the	 chute 	 s 	 	to	see	what	cattle	 we 	 re 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	.
people	thought	that	was	crazy	.	a	coat	on	a	 f 	 ence 	 	would	make	them	balk	,	 shadow 	 s 	 	would	make	them	balk	,	a	hose	on	the	floor	...
people	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	a	chain	 hang 	 ing 	 	down	--	and	that	's	 show 	 n 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	in	the	movie	.
in	fact	,	i	 love 	 d 	 	the	movie	,	how	they	 duplic 	 ated 	 	all	my	 project 	 s 	 	.	that	's	the	geek	side	.
my	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	got	to	star	in	the	movie	too	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	temple	grandin	,	``	not	``	 think 	 ing 	 	in	 picture 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	what	is	 think 	 ing 	 	in	 picture 	 s 	 	?	it	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	in	your	head	.
my	mind	 work 	 s 	 	like	google	for	 image 	 s 	 	.
now	,	when	i	was	a	young	kid	i	did	n't	know	my	 think 	 ing 	 	was	different	.
i	thought	 every 	 body 	 	thought	in	 picture 	 s 	 	.
and	then	when	i	did	my	book	,	``	 think 	 ing 	 	in	 picture 	 s 	 	,	``	i	start	 interview 	 ing 	 	people	about	how	they	think	.
and	i	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	to	find	out	that	my	 think 	 ing 	 	was	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.	like	if	i	say	,	``	think	about	a	church	 steep 	 le 	 	``	most	people	get	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 general 	 ized 	 	generic	one	.
now	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	not	true	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	but	it	's	going	to	be	true	in	a	lot	of	different	 place 	 s 	 	.
i	see	 on 	 ly 	 	specific	 picture 	 s 	 	.
they	flash	up	 in 	 to 	 	my	 memor 	 y 	 	,	just	like	google	for	 picture 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	movie	,	they	've	got	a	great	scene	in	there	where	the	word	``	shoe	``	is	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	a	whole	bunch	of	'50s	and	'60s	 shoe 	 s 	 	pop	 in 	 to 	 	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
ok	,	there	is	my	 child 	 hood 	 	church	,	that	's	specific	.	there	's	some	more	,	fort	collins	.
ok	,	how	about	famous	 one 	 s 	 	?
and	they	just	kind	of	come	up	,	kind	of	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
just	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	like	google	for	 picture 	 s 	 	.
and	they	come	up	one	at	a	time	,	and	then	i	think	,	``	ok	,	well	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	have	it	snow	,	or	we	can	have	a	 thunder 	 storm 	 	,	``	and	i	can	hold	it	there	and	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	 video 	 s 	 	.
now	,	visual	 think 	 ing 	 	was	a	tremendous	asset	in	my	work	 design 	 ing 	 	cattle	-	 hand 	 ling 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
and	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	on	 improv 	 ing 	 	how	cattle	are	 treat 	 ed 	 	at	the	 s 	 laughter 	 	plant	.
i	'm	not	going	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	any	 g 	 ucky 	 	 s 	 laughter 	 	 slide 	 s 	 	.
i	've	got	that	stuff	up	on	youtube	if	you	want	to	look	at	it	.
but	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	was	able	to	do	in	my	design	work	is	i	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	test	run	a	piece	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	in	my	mind	,	just	like	a	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	computer	system	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 a 	 erial 	 	view	of	a	 re 	 creation 	 	of	one	of	my	 project 	 s 	 	that	was	used	in	the	movie	.
that	was	like	just	so	super	cool	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	kind	of	asperger	 type 	 s 	 	and	 aut 	 ism 	 	 type 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	out	there	on	the	movie	set	too	.
but	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 es 	 	me	is	:	where	's	the	 young 	 er 	 	version	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	going	 to 	 day 	 	?
they	're	not	 end 	 ing 	 	up	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	where	they	belong	.
now	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	n't	that	social	,	is	i	had	to	sell	my	work	,	and	not	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	the	way	i	 s 	 old 	 	 live 	 stock 	 	 job 	 s 	 	is	i	 show 	 ed 	 	off	my	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	i	 show 	 ed 	 	off	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	 help 	 ed 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	little	kid	is	,	boy	,	in	the	'50s	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	taught	 manner 	 s 	 	.
you	 we 	 re 	 	taught	you	ca	n't	pull	the	 merchan 	 dis 	 e 	 	off	the	 shelv 	 es 	 	in	the	store	and	throw	it	around	.
now	,	when	 kid 	 s 	 	get	to	be	in	third	or	fourth	grade	,	you	might	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	kid	's	going	to	be	a	visual	 think 	 er 	 	,	 draw 	 ing 	 	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.	now	,	i	want	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	that	not	every	 aut 	 istic 	 	kid	is	going	to	be	a	visual	 think 	 er 	 	.
now	,	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	brain	 s 	 can 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	i	used	to	joke	around	about	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 gig 	 antic 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	trunk	line	going	deep	 in 	 to 	 	my	visual	cortex	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ten 	 s 	 or 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	.
and	my	great	big	 inter 	 net 	 	trunk	line	is	twice	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	the	control	's	.
the	red	lines	there	are	me	,	and	the	blue	lines	are	the	 s 	 ex 	 	and	age	-	 match 	 ed 	 	control	.
and	there	i	got	a	 gig 	 antic 	 	one	,	and	the	control	over	there	,	the	blue	one	,	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	 re 	 ally 	 	small	one	.
and	some	of	the	research	now	is	 show 	 ing 	 	is	that	people	on	the	spectrum	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	with	 prim 	 ary 	 	visual	cortex	.
now	,	the	thing	is	,	the	visual	 think 	 er 	 	's	just	one	kind	of	mind	.
you	see	,	the	 aut 	 istic 	 	mind	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 special 	 ist 	 	mind	--	good	at	one	thing	,	bad	at	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	where	i	was	bad	was	algebra	.	and	i	was	never	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	take	 geo 	 metry 	 	or	 t 	 rig 	 	.
 gig 	 antic 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	:	i	'm	 find 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 kid 	 s 	 	who	need	to	skip	algebra	,	go	right	to	 geo 	 metry 	 	and	 t 	 rig 	 	.
now	,	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	mind	is	the	pattern	 think 	 er 	 	.
more	abstract	.	these	are	your	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	your	computer	 programm 	 ers 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	pattern	 think 	 ing 	 	.	that	 pray 	 ing 	 	mantis	is	made	from	a	single	sheet	of	paper	--	no	 s 	 co 	 tch 	 	tape	,	no	 cut 	 s 	 	.
and	there	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	is	the	pattern	for	 fold 	 ing 	 	it	.
here	are	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	:	photo	-	realistic	visual	 think 	 ers 	 	,	like	me	;	pattern	 think 	 ers 	 	,	music	and	math	 mind 	 s 	 	.
some	of	these	 often 	 time 	 s 	 	have	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 read 	 ing 	 	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	will	see	these	kind	of	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 kid 	 s 	 	that	are	 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	.
you	'll	see	these	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 mind 	 s 	 	.
and	then	there	's	a	verbal	mind	,	they	know	every	fact	about	 every 	 thing 	 	.
now	,	 an 	 other 	 	thing	is	the	 sensor 	 y 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	wear	 th 	 is 	 	gadget	on	my	face	.
and	i	came	in	half	an	hour	 before 	 hand 	 	so	i	could	have	it	put	on	and	kind	of	get	used	to	it	,	and	they	got	it	bent	so	it	's	not	hitting	my	chin	.
but	 sensor 	 y 	 	is	an	issue	.	some	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	fluorescent	 light 	 s 	 	;	 other 	 s 	 	have	 problem 	 s 	 	with	sound	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	going	to	be	 vari 	 able 	 	.
now	,	visual	 think 	 ing 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	whole	lot	of	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	animal	mind	.
 be 	 cause 	 	think	about	it	:	an	animal	is	a	 sensor 	 y 	 	-	based	 think 	 er 	 	,	not	verbal	--	 think 	 s 	 	in	 picture 	 s 	 	,	 think 	 s 	 	in	 sound 	 s 	 	,	 think 	 s 	 	in	 smell 	 s 	 	.
think	about	how	much	information	there	is	there	on	the	local	fire	hydrant	.
he	 know 	 s 	 	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	there	.
are	they	friend	or	foe	?	is	there	 any 	 body 	 	he	can	go	mate	with	?
there	's	a	ton	of	information	on	that	fire	hydrant	.
it	's	all	 ver 	 y 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	information	,	and	,	looking	at	these	kind	of	 detail 	 s 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	lot	of	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	animal	mind	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	my	mind	,	 put 	 s 	 	 sensor 	 y 	 	-	based	information	 in 	 to 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
man	on	a	horse	and	a	man	on	the	ground	--	that	is	 view 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	two	 total 	 ly 	 	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	could	have	a	horse	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 abuse 	 d 	 	by	a	rider	.
they	'll	be	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fine	with	the	 veterin 	 arian 	 	and	with	the	 horse 	 shoe 	 r 	 	,	but	you	ca	n't	ride	him	.
you	have	 an 	 other 	 	horse	,	where	 may 	 be 	 	the	 horse 	 shoe 	 r 	 	beat	him	up	and	he	'll	be	 terr 	 ible 	 	for	 any 	 thing 	 	on	the	ground	,	with	the	 veterin 	 arian 	 	,	but	a	person	can	ride	him	.
cattle	are	the	same	way	.
man	on	a	horse	,	a	man	on	foot	--	they	're	two	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	see	,	it	's	a	different	picture	.
see	,	i	want	you	to	think	about	just	how	specific	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	put	information	 in 	 to 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	i	find	a	lot	of	people	are	not	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
when	i	'm	out	 trouble 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	or	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	in	a	plant	,	they	do	n't	seem	to	be	able	to	figure	out	,	``	do	i	have	a	training	people	issue	?
or	do	i	have	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	?	``
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 categor 	 ize 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	problem	from	a	people	problem	.
i	find	a	lot	of	people	have	 difficult 	 y 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
now	,	let	's	say	i	figure	out	it	's	an	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	problem	.
is	it	a	minor	problem	,	with	 some 	 thing 	 	simple	i	can	fix	?
or	is	the	whole	design	of	the	system	wrong	?
people	have	a	hard	time	 figur 	 ing 	 	that	out	.
let	's	just	look	at	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	you	know	,	solving	 problem 	 s 	 	with	making	 air 	 lines 	 	 safe 	 r 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'm	a	million	-	mile	 fly 	 er 	 	.
i	do	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 fly 	 ing 	 	,	and	if	i	was	at	the	faa	,	what	would	i	be	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	direct	 observ 	 ation 	 	of	?
it	would	be	 the 	 ir 	 	 air 	 plane 	 	 tail 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	five	fatal	 wreck 	 s 	 	in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	tail	either	came	off	or	 steer 	 ing 	 	stuff	 in 	 side 	 	the	tail	broke	in	some	way	.
it	's	 tail 	 s 	 	,	 pur 	 e 	 	and	simple	.
and	when	the	 pilot 	 s 	 	walk	around	the	plane	,	guess	what	?	they	ca	n't	see	that	stuff	 in 	 side 	 	the	tail	.
you	know	,	now	 a 	 s 	 	i	think	about	that	,	i	'm	 pull 	 ing 	 	up	all	of	that	specific	information	.
it	's	specific	.	see	,	my	 think 	 ing 	 	's	bottom	-	up	.
i	take	all	the	little	 piece 	 s 	 	and	i	put	the	 piece 	 s 	 	together	like	a	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
now	,	here	is	a	horse	that	was	 death 	 ly 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	black	 cow 	 boy 	 	 hat 	 s 	 	.
he	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 abuse 	 d 	 	by	 some 	 body 	 	with	a	black	 cow 	 boy 	 	hat	.
white	 cow 	 boy 	 	 hat 	 s 	 	,	that	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fine	.
now	,	the	thing	is	,	the	world	is	going	to	need	all	of	the	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 mind 	 s 	 	to	work	together	.
we	've	got	to	work	on	 develop 	 ing 	 	all	these	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 mind 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	me	 re 	 ally 	 	crazy	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	travel	around	and	i	do	 aut 	 ism 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	is	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	smart	,	 geek 	 y 	 	,	 nerd 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	they	just	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	social	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	's	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 develop 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	interest	in	 some 	 thing 	 	like	science	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	up	the	whole	thing	of	my	science	teacher	.
my	science	teacher	is	 show 	 n 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	in	the	movie	.
i	was	a	 goof 	 ball 	 	student	.	when	i	was	in	high	school	i	just	did	n't	care	at	all	about	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	i	had	mr.	carlock	's	science	class	.
he	was	now	dr.	carlock	in	the	movie	.
and	he	got	me	 challeng 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	an	optical	illusion	room	.
 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	up	the	whole	thing	of	you	've	got	to	show	 kid 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
you	know	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	think	 may 	 be 	 	ted	ought	to	do	is	tell	all	the	 school 	 s 	 	about	all	the	great	 lectur 	 es 	 	that	are	on	ted	,	and	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	great	stuff	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	to	get	these	 kid 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	these	 geek 	 y 	 	 nerd 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	out	in	the	 mid 	 west 	 	,	and	the	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	country	,	when	you	get	away	from	these	tech	 area 	 s 	 	,	they	do	n't	know	what	to	do	with	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	not	going	down	the	right	path	.
the	thing	is	,	you	can	make	a	mind	to	be	more	of	a	 think 	 ing 	 	and	cognitive	mind	,	or	your	mind	can	be	wired	to	be	more	social	.
and	what	some	of	the	research	now	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	in	 aut 	 ism 	 	is	there	may	by	extra	wiring	back	here	,	in	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	mind	,	and	we	lose	a	few	social	 circuit 	 s 	 	here	.
it	's	kind	of	a	trade	-	off	between	 think 	 ing 	 	and	social	.
and	then	you	can	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	point	where	it	's	so	severe	you	're	going	to	have	a	person	that	's	going	to	be	non	-	verbal	.
in	the	normal	human	mind	language	 cover 	 s 	 	up	the	visual	 think 	 ing 	 	we	share	with	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	work	of	dr.	bruce	miller	.
and	he	 stud 	 ied 	 	alzheimer	's	 patient 	 s 	 	that	had	frontal	temporal	lobe	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	.
and	the	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	ate	out	the	language	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	,	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	 art 	 work 	 	came	out	of	 some 	 body 	 	who	used	to	install	 stereo 	 s 	 	in	 car 	 s 	 	.
now	,	van	gogh	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	physics	,	but	i	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	there	was	some	work	 d 	 one 	 	to	show	that	 th 	 is 	 	 ed 	 dy 	 	pattern	in	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	a	 statistic 	 al 	 	model	of	 turbul 	 ence 	 	,	which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	up	the	whole	 interest 	 ing 	 	idea	of	 may 	 be 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	is	in	our	own	head	.
and	the	wolfram	stuff	--	i	was	taking	 note 	 s 	 	and	i	was	writing	down	all	the	search	 word 	 s 	 	i	could	use	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	that	's	going	to	go	on	in	my	 aut 	 ism 	 	 lectur 	 es 	 	.
we	've	got	to	show	these	 kid 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
and	they	've	taken	out	the	 auto 	 shop 	 	class	and	the	 draft 	 ing 	 	class	and	the	art	class	.
i	mean	art	was	my	best	subject	in	school	.
we	've	got	to	think	about	all	these	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 mind 	 s 	 	,	and	we	've	got	to	 absolute 	 ly 	 	work	with	these	kind	of	 mind 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 absolute 	 ly 	 	are	going	to	need	these	kind	of	people	in	the	future	.
and	let	's	talk	about	 job 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	my	science	teacher	got	me	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	a	 goof 	 ball 	 	that	did	n't	want	to	 stud 	 y 	 	.
but	you	know	what	?	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	work	experience	.
i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	too	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	smart	 kid 	 s 	 	who	have	n't	 learn 	 ed 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	how	to	be	on	time	.
i	was	taught	that	when	i	was	eight	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
you	know	,	how	to	have	table	 manner 	 s 	 	at	 grann 	 y 	 	's	sunday	party	.
i	was	taught	that	when	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	young	.
and	when	i	was	13	,	i	had	a	job	at	a	 dress 	 maker 	 	's	shop	 sew 	 ing 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	.
i	did	 intern 	 ship 	 s 	 	in	college	,	i	was	building	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 al 	 so 	 	had	to	learn	how	to	do	 assign 	 ments 	 	.
you	know	,	all	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	draw	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 horse 	 s 	 	when	i	was	little	.
my	mother	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	let	's	do	a	picture	of	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.	``
they	've	got	to	learn	how	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
let	's	say	the	kid	is	 fix 	 ated 	 	on	legos	.
let	's	get	him	 work 	 ing 	 	on	building	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	thing	about	the	 aut 	 istic 	 	mind	is	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	 fix 	 ated 	 	.
like	if	a	kid	 love 	 s 	 	 race 	 car 	 s 	 	,	let	's	use	 race 	 car 	 s 	 	for	math	.
let	's	figure	out	how	long	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	 race 	 car 	 	to	go	a	certain	distance	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	use	that	 fix 	 ation 	 	in	order	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	that	kid	,	that	's	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	need	to	do	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	get	fed	up	when	they	,	you	know	,	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	you	get	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	country	,	they	do	n't	know	what	to	do	with	these	smart	 kid 	 s 	 	.
it	just	 drive 	 s 	 	me	crazy	.
what	can	visual	 think 	 ers 	 	do	when	they	grow	up	?
they	can	do	graphic	design	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	with	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 photograph 	 y 	 	,	industrial	design	.
the	pattern	 think 	 ers 	 	,	they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	be	your	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	,	your	 soft 	 ware 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	your	computer	 programm 	 ers 	 	,	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	've	got	the	word	 mind 	 s 	 	.	they	make	great	 journalist 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	make	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	good	stage	 act 	 ors 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	thing	about	 be 	 ing 	 	 aut 	 istic 	 	is	,	i	had	to	learn	social	 skill 	 s 	 	like	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	play	.
it	's	just	kind	of	--	you	just	have	to	learn	it	.
and	we	need	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	with	these	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	up	 mentor 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	my	science	teacher	was	not	an	accredited	teacher	.
he	was	a	nasa	space	scientist	.
now	,	some	 state 	 s 	 	now	are	 get 	 ting 	 	it	to	where	if	you	have	a	degree	in	biology	,	or	a	degree	in	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	you	can	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	school	and	teach	biology	or	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
we	need	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	i	'm	 observ 	 ing 	 	is	the	good	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	for	a	lot	of	these	 kid 	 s 	 	,	are	out	in	the	community	 college 	 s 	 	,	but	we	need	to	be	 get 	 ting 	 	some	of	these	good	 teacher 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	high	 school 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	is	there	is	a	lot	of	people	that	may	have	 retire 	 d 	 	from	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	industry	,	and	they	can	teach	your	kid	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	if	what	they	teach	them	is	old	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	you	're	 light 	 ing 	 	the	spark	.
you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	that	kid	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	.
and	you	get	him	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	,	then	he	'll	learn	all	the	new	stuff	.
 mentor 	 s 	 	are	just	essential	.
i	can	not	 emphas 	 ize 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	what	my	science	teacher	did	for	me	.
and	we	've	got	to	mentor	them	,	hire	them	.
and	if	you	 br 	 ing 	 	them	in	for	 intern 	 ship 	 s 	 	in	your	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	the	thing	about	the	 aut 	 ism 	 	,	asperger	-	y	kind	of	mind	,	you	've	got	to	give	them	a	specific	task	.	do	n't	just	say	,	``	design	new	 soft 	 ware 	 	.	``
you	've	got	to	tell	them	 some 	 thing 	 	a	lot	more	specific	:	``	well	,	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	for	a	phone	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	some	specific	thing	.
and	it	can	 on 	 ly 	 	use	so	much	 memor 	 y 	 	.	``
that	's	the	kind	of	 specific 	 ity 	 	you	need	.
well	,	that	's	the	end	of	my	talk	.
and	i	just	want	to	thank	 every 	 body 	 	for	coming	.
it	was	great	to	be	here	.
oh	,	you	've	got	a	question	for	me	?	ok	.
chris	anderson	:	thank	you	so	much	for	that	.
you	know	,	you	once	wrote	,	i	like	 th 	 is 	 	quote	,	``	if	by	some	magic	,	 aut 	 ism 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 eradic 	 ated 	 	from	the	face	of	the	earth	,	then	men	would	still	be	 social 	 izing 	 	in	front	of	a	wood	fire	at	the	 en 	 trance 	 	to	a	cave	.	``
temple	grandin	:	 be 	 cause 	 	who	do	you	think	made	the	first	stone	 spear 	 s 	 	?
the	asperger	guy	.	and	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	get	rid	of	all	the	 aut 	 ism 	 	 genetic 	 s 	 	there	would	be	no	more	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	and	the	energy	crisis	would	not	be	 solve 	 d 	 	.
ca	:	so	,	i	want	to	ask	you	a	couple	other	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	if	any	of	these	feel	 in 	 appropriate 	 	,	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	just	to	say	,	``	next	question	.	``
but	if	there	is	 some 	 one 	 	here	who	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 aut 	 istic 	 	child	,	or	 know 	 s 	 	an	 aut 	 istic 	 	child	and	 feel 	 s 	 	kind	of	cut	off	from	them	,	what	 ad 	 vice 	 	would	you	give	them	?
tg	:	well	,	first	of	all	,	you	've	got	to	look	at	age	.
if	you	have	a	two	,	three	or	four	year	old	you	know	,	no	speech	,	no	social	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	i	ca	n't	 emphas 	 ize 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	:	do	n't	wait	,	you	need	at	 l 	 east 	 	20	 hour 	 s 	 	a	week	of	one	-	to	-	one	 teach 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	the	thing	is	,	 aut 	 ism 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	different	 degree 	 s 	 	.
there	's	going	to	be	about	half	the	people	on	the	spectrum	that	are	not	going	to	learn	to	talk	,	and	they	're	not	going	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	that	would	not	be	a	 reason 	 able 	 	thing	for	them	to	do	.
but	then	you	get	the	smart	,	 geek 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	that	have	a	touch	of	 aut 	 ism 	 	,	and	that	's	where	you	've	got	to	get	them	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	with	 do 	 ing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	got	social	 interact 	 ion 	 	through	 share 	 d 	 	interest	.
i	 rod 	 e 	 	 horse 	 s 	 	with	other	 kid 	 s 	 	,	i	made	model	 rocket 	 s 	 	with	other	 kid 	 s 	 	,	did	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	lab	with	other	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	'60s	,	it	was	 glu 	 ing 	 	 mirror 	 s 	 	onto	a	rubber	membrane	on	a	speaker	to	make	a	light	show	.
that	was	like	,	we	 consider 	 ed 	 	that	super	cool	.
ca	:	is	it	 un 	 realistic 	 	for	them	to	hope	or	think	that	that	child	 love 	 s 	 	them	,	 a 	 s 	 	some	might	,	 a 	 s 	 	most	,	wish	?
tg	:	well	let	me	tell	you	,	that	child	will	be	loyal	,	and	if	your	house	is	 burn 	 ing 	 	down	,	they	're	going	to	get	you	out	of	it	.
ca	:	 w 	 ow 	 	.	so	,	most	people	,	if	you	ask	them	what	are	they	most	passionate	about	,	they	'd	say	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	my	 kid 	 s 	 	``	or	``	my	lover	.	``
what	are	you	most	passionate	about	?
tg	:	i	'm	passionate	about	that	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	do	are	going	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	.
when	i	have	a	mother	of	an	 aut 	 istic 	 	child	say	,	``	my	kid	went	to	college	 be 	 cause 	 	of	your	book	,	or	one	of	your	 lectur 	 es 	 	,	``	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	happy	.
you	know	,	the	 s 	 laughter 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	with	them	in	the	'80s	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	awful	.
i	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	 s 	 cor 	 ing 	 	system	for	 s 	 laughter 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	where	you	just	measure	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	:	how	 man 	 y 	 	cattle	fell	down	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	cattle	got	 poke 	 d 	 	with	the	 prodd 	 er 	 	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	cattle	are	 mo 	 o 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	off	?
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
you	 direct 	 ly 	 	 observ 	 e 	 	a	few	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 work 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.	i	get	satisfaction	out	of	 see 	 ing 	 	stuff	that	 make 	 s 	 	real	change	in	the	real	world	.	we	need	a	lot	more	of	that	,	and	a	lot	less	abstract	stuff	.
ca	:	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	on	the	phone	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 astonish 	 ed 	 	me	was	you	 s 	 aid 	 	one	thing	you	 we 	 re 	 	passionate	about	was	 serv 	 er 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	.	tell	me	about	that	.
tg	:	well	the	reason	why	i	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	when	i	read	about	that	,	it	 contain 	 s 	 	knowledge	.
it	's	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	.
and	to	me	,	knowledge	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	.	so	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	over	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	now	our	library	got	 flood 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	before	the	 inter 	 net 	 	got	 re 	 ally 	 	big	.
and	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 up 	 set 	 	about	all	the	 book 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 wreck 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	knowledge	 be 	 ing 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	.
and	 serv 	 er 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	,	or	data	 center 	 s 	 	are	great	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	of	knowledge	.
ca	:	temple	,	can	i	just	say	it	's	an	absolute	 de 	 light 	 	to	have	you	at	ted	.
tg	:	well	thank	you	so	much	.	thank	you	.
