the	future	of	life	,	where	the	 unravel 	 ing 	 	of	our	biology	--	and	 br 	 ing 	 	up	the	 light 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	.	i	do	n't	have	any	 slide 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	just	going	to	talk	--	about	where	that	's	 like 	 ly 	 	to	carry	us	.
and	you	know	,	i	saw	all	the	 vision 	 s 	 	of	the	first	couple	of	 session 	 s 	 	.
it	 al 	 most 	 	made	me	feel	a	little	bit	 guilt 	 y 	 	about	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	 up 	 lift 	 ing 	 	talk	about	the	future	.
it	felt	wrong	to	do	that	in	some	way	.
and	yet	,	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	it	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 large 	 r 	 	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	what	is	going	to	remain	--	what	people	in	the	future	are	going	to	remember	about	 th 	 is 	 	period	.
i	want	to	talk	to	you	a	little	bit	about	why	the	 vision 	 s 	 	of	jeremy	rivkins	,	who	would	like	to	ban	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	or	of	the	bill	 joy 	 s 	 	who	would	like	to	relinquish	them	,	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	to	follow	 t 	 hose 	 	 path 	 s 	 	would	be	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	for	us	.
i	'm	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	biology	,	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 science 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	are	going	to	be	the	 area 	 s 	 	that	are	the	most	significant	to	us	.
the	reason	for	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 fl 	 esh 	 	and	blood	.
we	're	 bio 	 logical 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	can	do	with	our	biology	is	going	to	shape	our	future	and	that	of	our	children	and	that	of	 the 	 ir 	 	children	--	 whet 	 her 	 	we	gain	control	over	aging	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	learn	to	protect	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	alzheimer	's	,	and	heart	disease	,	and	cancer	.
i	think	that	shakespeare	 re 	 ally 	 	put	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	use	his	 word 	 s 	 	in	the	same	order	that	he	did	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	so	from	hour	to	hour	we	 rip 	 e 	 	and	 rip 	 e 	 	.
and	then	from	hour	to	hour	we	rot	and	rot	.
and	 there 	 by 	 	 hang 	 s 	 	a	tale	.	``
life	is	short	,	you	know	.
and	we	need	to	think	about	 plan 	 ning 	 	a	little	bit	.
we	're	all	going	to	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	even	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	,	going	to	have	to	lose	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	love	.
when	you	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	rot	a	little	bit	,	all	of	the	 video 	 s 	 	 cram 	 med 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	head	,	all	of	the	 extens 	 ions 	 	that	extend	your	 vari 	 ous 	 	 power 	 s 	 	,	are	going	to	 be 	 ing 	 	to	seem	a	little	 second 	 ary 	 	.
and	you	know	,	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	bit	gray	--	so	is	ray	kurzweil	,	so	is	eric	drexler	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	central	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
now	i	know	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	whole	lot	of	hype	about	our	power	to	control	biology	.
you	just	have	to	look	at	the	human	genome	project	.
it	was	n't	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	 every 	 body 	 	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	we	've	found	the	holy	 g 	 rail 	 	of	biology	.
we	're	 decipher 	 ing 	 	the	code	of	 code 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 read 	 ing 	 	the	book	of	life	.
it	's	a	little	bit	 re 	 mini 	 s 	 cent 	 	of	1969	when	neil	armstrong	 walk 	 ed 	 	on	the	moon	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	was	about	to	race	out	 to 	 ward 	 	the	 star 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	``	2001	:	a	space	odyssey	.	``
you	know	it	's	2003	,	and	there	is	no	hal	.
and	there	is	no	odyssey	to	our	own	moon	,	much	less	the	 moon 	 s 	 	of	jupiter	.
and	we	're	still	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	 piece 	 s 	 	of	the	challenger	.
so	it	's	not	surprising	that	some	people	would	wonder	 whet 	 her 	 	 may 	 be 	 	30	or	40	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	we	'll	look	back	at	 th 	 is 	 	instant	in	time	,	and	all	of	the	sort	of	talk	about	the	human	genome	project	,	and	what	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	mean	to	us	--	well	,	it	will	 re 	 ally 	 	mean	precious	little	.
and	i	just	want	to	say	that	that	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	going	to	be	the	case	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	talk	about	our	 genetic 	 s 	 	and	our	biology	,	and	 modify 	 ing 	 	and	 alter 	 ing 	 	and	 adjust 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	changing	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	critical	stuff	.
if	you	have	any	 doubt 	 s 	 	about	how	technology	 affect 	 s 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	you	just	have	to	go	to	any	major	city	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	stomping	ground	of	our	 ple 	 ist 	 ocene 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	.
what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	we	're	taking	 th 	 is 	 	technology	--	it	's	 be 	 coming 	 	more	precise	,	more	potent	--	and	we	're	 turn 	 ing 	 	it	back	 up 	 on 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
before	it	's	all	 d 	 one 	 	we	are	going	to	alter	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	every	bit	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	around	us	.
it	's	going	to	happen	a	lot	 soon 	 er 	 	than	people	imagine	.
on	the	way	there	it	's	going	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	 revolution 	 ize 	 	medicine	and	health	care	;	that	's	obvious	.
it	's	going	to	change	the	way	we	have	children	.
it	's	going	to	change	the	way	we	manage	and	alter	our	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
it	's	going	to	 prob 	 ably 	 	change	the	human	 life 	 span 	 	.
it	will	 re 	 ally 	 	make	us	question	what	it	is	to	be	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
the	 large 	 r 	 	 con 	 text 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	are	two	unprecedented	 revolution 	 s 	 	that	are	going	on	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	first	of	them	is	the	obvious	one	,	the	silicon	revolution	,	which	you	all	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	.
it	's	changing	our	 live 	 s 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	and	it	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	do	that	.
what	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	that	is	,	is	that	we	're	taking	the	sand	at	our	feet	,	the	 in 	 ert 	 	silicon	at	our	feet	,	and	we	're	 breath 	 ing 	 	a	level	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	that	 rival 	 s 	 	that	of	life	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	may	even	surpass	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	 out 	 growth 	 	of	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	of	that	revolution	,	is	the	revolution	in	biology	.
the	 genomic 	 s 	 	revolution	,	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	,	metabolomics	,	all	of	these	``	omics	``	that	sound	so	 terr 	 ific 	 	on	 grant 	 s 	 	and	on	business	 plan 	 s 	 	.
what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	we	are	 s 	 e 	 izing 	 	control	of	our	 evolution 	 ary 	 	future	.
i	mean	we	're	 essential 	 ly 	 	using	technology	to	just	jam	evolution	 in 	 to 	 	fast	-	forward	.
it	's	not	at	all	clear	where	it	's	going	to	take	us	.
but	in	five	to	ten	 year 	 s 	 	we	're	going	to	start	see	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
the	most	 im 	 mediate 	 	 change 	 s 	 	that	we	'll	see	are	 thing 	 s 	 	like	in	medicine	.
there	is	going	to	be	a	big	shift	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 prevent 	 ative 	 	medicine	 a 	 s 	 	we	start	to	be	able	to	identify	all	of	the	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
but	who	is	going	to	pay	for	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	how	are	we	going	to	understand	all	 th 	 is 	 	complex	information	?
that	is	going	to	be	the	it	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	the	next	generation	,	is	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	information	.
there	's	 pharmaco 	 genomic 	 s 	 	,	the	combination	of	 pharmaco 	 logy 	 	and	 genetic 	 s 	 	:	 tailor 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	to	our	individual	constitutions	that	juan	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	a	little	bit	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
that	's	going	to	have	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	going	to	be	used	for	diet	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	 nutrition 	 al 	 	 supplement 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	.
but	it	's	going	to	have	a	big	impact	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	have	niche	 drug 	 s 	 	.
and	we	are	n't	going	to	be	able	to	support	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 expense 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	create	 block 	 buster 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	approval	process	is	going	to	fall	 a 	 part 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	too	 s 	 low 	 	.
it	's	too	risk	-	 a 	 verse 	 	.
and	it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 suit 	 ed 	 	for	the	future	that	we	're	moving	 in 	 to 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	is	that	we	're	just	going	to	have	to	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	when	we	hear	,	``	oh	,	99.9	percent	of	the	 letter 	 s 	 	in	the	code	are	the	same	.
we	're	all	 ident 	 ical 	 	to	each	other	.	is	n't	it	 wonder 	 ful 	 	?	``
and	look	around	you	and	know	that	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	is	that	little	bit	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
we	look	the	same	to	a	 visit 	 or 	 	from	 an 	 other 	 	planet	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	but	not	to	each	other	 be 	 cause 	 	we	compete	with	each	other	all	time	.
and	we	're	going	to	have	to	come	to	 grip 	 s 	 	with	the	fact	that	there	are	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	us	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	that	we	will	know	about	,	and	between	 sub 	 population 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
to	 den 	 y 	 	that	that	's	the	case	is	not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	start	on	that	.
a	generation	or	so	away	there	are	going	to	be	even	more	 pro 	 found 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	happen	.
that	's	when	we	're	going	to	begin	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	to	modify	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
now	i	do	n't	mean	extra	 gill 	 s 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	we	care	about	,	like	aging	.
what	if	we	could	unravel	aging	and	understand	it	--	begin	to	retard	the	process	or	even	reverse	it	?
it	would	change	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	it	's	obvious	to	 any 	 one 	 	,	that	if	we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 absolute 	 ly 	 	will	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	are	.
the	second	is	 modify 	 ing 	 	our	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	ritalin	,	viagra	,	 thing 	 s 	 	of	that	sort	,	prozac	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	clumsy	little	baby	 step 	 s 	 	.
what	if	you	could	take	a	little	 concoct 	 ion 	 	of	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	that	would	make	you	feel	 re 	 ally 	 	 content 	 ed 	 	,	just	happy	to	be	you	.
are	you	going	to	be	able	to	resist	that	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	 over 	 t 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	?
 prob 	 ably 	 	not	.
and	if	you	do	n't	,	who	are	you	going	to	be	?
why	do	you	do	what	you	do	?
we	're	sort	of	circumventing	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 program 	 s 	 	that	guide	our	behavior	.
it	's	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	to	deal	with	.
the	third	area	is	 re 	 production 	 	.
the	idea	that	we	're	going	to	chose	our	children	's	 gene 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	begin	to	understand	what	 gene 	 s 	 	say	about	who	we	are	.
that	's	the	focus	of	my	book	``	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	``	where	i	talk	about	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 choice 	 s 	 	we	'll	make	,	and	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	it	's	going	to	present	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
there	are	three	obvious	ways	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	first	is	 clon 	 ing 	 	.
it	did	n't	happen	.
it	's	a	total	media	circus	.
it	will	happen	in	five	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	when	it	 do 	 es 	 	it	's	not	going	to	be	that	big	a	deal	.
the	birth	of	a	 delay 	 ed 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 	is	not	going	to	shake	western	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
but	there	are	more	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	:	embryo	 screen 	 ing 	 	.
you	take	a	six	to	eight	cell	embryo	,	you	 teas 	 e 	 	out	one	of	the	 cell 	 s 	 	,	you	run	a	genetic	test	on	that	cell	,	and	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	that	test	you	either	implant	that	embryo	or	you	 dis 	 card 	 	it	.
it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	avoid	rare	 disease 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	it	's	going	to	be	possible	to	avoid	 virtual 	 ly 	 	all	genetic	 disease 	 s 	 	in	that	way	.
 a 	 s 	 	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	possible	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	move	from	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	used	by	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	 in 	 fertil 	 ity 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	and	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	vitro	 fertil 	 ization 	 	,	to	the	 wealth 	 y 	 	who	want	to	protect	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	to	just	about	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
and	in	that	process	that	's	going	to	morph	from	 be 	 ing 	 	just	for	 disease 	 s 	 	,	to	 be 	 ing 	 	for	 less 	 er 	 	 vulner 	 abilities 	 	,	like	risk	of	 man 	 ic 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	to	 pick 	 ing 	 	 personal 	 ities 	 	,	 temperament 	 s 	 	,	 trait 	 s 	 	,	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
of	course	there	is	going	to	be	genetic	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
 direct 	 ly 	 	going	in	--	it	's	a	little	bit	further	away	,	but	not	that	far	away	--	going	in	and	 alter 	 ing 	 	the	 gene 	 s 	 	in	the	first	cell	in	an	embryo	.
the	way	i	suspect	it	will	happen	is	using	artificial	 chromosom 	 es 	 	and	extra	 chromosom 	 es 	 	,	so	we	go	from	46	to	47	or	48	.
and	one	that	is	not	 heri 	 table 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	who	would	want	to	pass	on	to	 the 	 ir 	 	children	the	 arch 	 a 	 ic 	 	 enhance 	 ment 	 	 modul 	 es 	 	that	they	got	25	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	?
it	's	a	joke	;	of	course	they	would	n't	want	to	do	that	.
they	'll	want	the	new	 re 	 lease 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	loose	 analog 	 ies 	 	with	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	with	 programm 	 ing 	 	,	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	much	 deep 	 er 	 	than	that	.
they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	come	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	realm	.
now	not	 every 	 thing 	 	that	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	should	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	it	wo	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
but	when	 some 	 thing 	 	is	 feas 	 ible 	 	in	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	all	over	the	world	,	which	is	going	to	be	the	case	with	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	when	there	are	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	who	see	them	 a 	 s 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	,	which	is	 al 	 ready 	 	the	case	,	and	when	they	're	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	police	,	it	's	not	a	question	of	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	happen	,	it	's	when	and	where	and	how	it	's	going	to	happen	.
 human 	 ity 	 	is	going	to	go	down	 th 	 is 	 	path	.
and	it	's	going	to	do	so	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	that	all	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	just	a	spin	-	off	of	 main 	 stream 	 	medical	research	that	 every 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	see	happen	.
it	is	 be 	 ing 	 	funded	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	--	in	a	big	way	.
the	second	is	,	we	're	human	.
that	's	what	we	do	.
we	try	and	use	our	technology	to	improve	our	 live 	 s 	 	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
to	imagine	that	we	're	not	going	to	use	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	when	they	 be 	 come 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	is	 a 	 s 	 	much	a	 deni 	 al 	 	of	who	we	are	 a 	 s 	 	to	imagine	that	we	'll	use	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	not	fret	and	worry	about	it	a	great	deal	.
the	lines	are	going	to	blur	.	and	they	 al 	 ready 	 	are	between	therapy	and	 enhance 	 ment 	 	,	between	 treat 	 ment 	 	and	 prevent 	 ion 	 	,	between	need	and	 desir 	 e 	 	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	central	one	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.
people	can	try	and	ban	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	 un 	 doubt 	 ed 	 ly 	 	will	.	they	have	.
but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	do	is	just	shift	 develop 	 ment 	 	 else 	 where 	 	.
it	's	going	to	drive	these	 thing 	 s 	 	from	view	.
it	's	going	to	 re 	 serve 	 	the	technology	for	the	 wealth 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	in	the	best	position	to	 circum 	 vent 	 	any	of	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 law 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	going	to	 den 	 y 	 	us	the	information	that	we	need	to	make	wise	 decision 	 s 	 	about	how	to	use	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
so	,	 s 	 ure 	 	,	we	need	to	debate	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	that	we	do	.
but	we	should	n't	kid	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	think	that	we	're	going	to	reach	a	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
that	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	going	to	happen	.
they	touch	us	too	 deep 	 ly 	 	.
and	they	depend	too	much	 up 	 on 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	 up 	 on 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	 up 	 on 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	 up 	 on 	 	culture	,	 up 	 on 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	.
some	people	are	going	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 abo 	 min 	 ation 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	worst	thing	,	 a 	 s 	 	just	awful	.
other	people	are	going	to	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 flower 	 ing 	 	of	human	endeavor	.	``
the	one	thing	 th 	 ough 	 	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	about	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	is	that	it	's	easy	to	 be 	 come 	 	 seduce 	 d 	 	by	them	.
and	to	focus	too	much	on	all	the	high	-	technology	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	exist	.
and	to	lose	touch	with	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 rhythm 	 s 	 	of	our	biology	and	our	health	.
there	are	too	 man 	 y 	 	people	that	think	that	high	-	technology	medicine	is	going	to	keep	them	,	 s 	 ave 	 	them	,	from	 over 	 eating 	 	,	from	eating	a	lot	of	fast	 food 	 s 	 	,	from	not	 get 	 ting 	 	any	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
it	's	not	going	to	happen	.
in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	technology	,	and	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 occur 	 ring 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	sort	of	a	counter	-	revolution	that	is	going	on	:	a	 resurg 	 ence 	 	of	interest	in	 remedi 	 es 	 	from	the	past	,	in	nutraceuticals	,	in	all	of	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	some	people	,	in	the	pharmaceutical	industry	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	,	like	to	brand	 a 	 s 	 	non	-	science	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	whole	effort	is	generated	,	is	driven	,	by	it	 a 	 s 	 	well	 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	how	we	're	 gather 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	and	 link 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	 integ 	 rating 	 	it	together	.
there	is	a	lot	in	 th 	 is 	 	rich	 bio 	 ta 	 	that	is	going	to	serve	us	well	.
and	that	's	where	about	half	of	our	 drug 	 s 	 	come	.
so	we	should	n't	dismiss	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	enormous	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	use	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 result 	 s 	 	,	or	these	random	loose	 trial 	 s 	 	from	the	last	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	about	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	on	our	health	.
and	to	use	our	 advance 	 d 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	pull	out	what	is	 benefici 	 al 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	sea	of	noise	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
in	fact	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	just	abstract	.
i	just	 form 	 ed 	 	a	 bio 	 technology 	 	company	that	is	using	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	an	approach	to	develop	 therapeutic 	 s 	 	for	alzheimer	's	and	other	 disease 	 s 	 	of	aging	,	and	we	're	making	some	real	progress	.
so	here	we	are	.
it	's	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	a	new	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	.
if	you	look	forward	,	i	mean	future	 human 	 s 	 	,	far	before	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	,	in	a	few	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	are	going	to	look	back	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	.
and	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	's	 session 	 s 	 	you	'd	think	that	they	're	going	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	difficult	,	 pain 	 ful 	 	period	that	we	 struggle 	 d 	 	through	.
and	i	do	n't	think	that	's	what	's	going	to	happen	.
they	're	going	to	do	like	 every 	 body 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.	they	are	going	to	forget	about	all	that	stuff	.
and	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	 romantic 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	moment	in	time	.
they	are	going	to	think	about	it	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 glor 	 ious 	 	instant	when	we	laid	down	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 found 	 ations 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	of	 the 	 ir 	 	future	.
you	know	it	's	a	little	bit	like	a	birth	.
where	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	 blood 	 y 	 	,	awful	mess	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	then	what	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	it	?	new	life	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	was	 point 	 ed 	 	out	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	we	forget	about	all	the	struggle	there	was	in	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.
so	to	me	,	it	's	clear	that	one	of	the	 found 	 ations 	 	of	that	future	is	going	to	be	the	 re 	 work 	 ing 	 	of	our	biology	.
it	's	going	to	come	 gradu 	 ally 	 	at	first	.	it	's	going	to	pick	up	speed	.
we	're	going	to	make	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 error 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	way	these	 thing 	 s 	 	work	.
to	me	it	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	privilege	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	now	and	to	be	able	to	witness	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	a	 un 	 ique 	 	instant	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	all	of	life	.
it	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 remember 	 ed 	 	.
and	what	's	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	is	that	we	're	not	just	 observ 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	are	the	 architect 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	think	that	we	should	be	proud	of	it	.
what	is	so	difficult	and	 challeng 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	are	 al 	 so 	 	the	 object 	 s 	 	of	these	 change 	 s 	 	.
it	's	our	health	,	it	's	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	it	's	our	future	,	it	's	our	children	.
and	that	is	why	they	are	so	 ver 	 y 	 	 trou 	 bling 	 	to	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	who	would	pull	back	in	fear	.
i	think	that	our	choice	in	the	choice	of	life	,	is	not	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	going	to	go	down	 th 	 is 	 	path	.
we	are	,	 definite 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	how	we	hold	it	in	our	 heart 	 s 	 	.
it	's	how	we	look	at	it	.
i	think	thucydides	 re 	 ally 	 	spoke	to	us	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	in	430	b.c	.	he	put	it	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	'll	use	the	 word 	 s 	 	in	the	same	order	he	did	.
``	the	 brave 	 st 	 	are	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	the	 clear 	 est 	 	vision	of	what	is	before	them	,	both	 glor 	 y 	 	and	danger	 a 	 like 	 	.
and	yet	 not 	 with 	 stand 	 ing 	 	,	they	go	out	and	they	meet	it	.	``
thank	you	.
