two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	i	was	in	my	studio	in	paris	,	and	the	phone	rang	and	i	heard	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	jr	,	you	won	the	ted	prize	2011	.
you	have	to	make	a	wish	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.	``
i	was	lost	.
i	mean	,	i	ca	n't	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.	 no 	 body 	 	can	.
the	world	is	 fuck 	 ed 	 	up	.
come	on	,	you	have	 dictator 	 s 	 	 rul 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	population	is	growing	by	 million 	 s 	 	,	there	's	no	more	fish	in	the	sea	,	the	north	pole	is	 melt 	 ing 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	last	ted	prize	winner	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	're	all	 be 	 coming 	 	fat	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	 may 	 be 	 	french	people	.
 what 	 ever 	 	.
so	i	 call 	 ed 	 	back	and	i	told	her	,	``	look	,	amy	,	tell	the	ted	 guy 	 s 	 	i	just	wo	n't	show	up	.
i	ca	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	jr	,	your	wish	is	not	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	,	but	to	change	the	world	.	``
``	oh	,	all	right	.	``
``	that	's	cool	.	``
i	mean	,	technology	,	 politic 	 s 	 	,	business	do	change	the	world	--	not	 al 	 ways 	 	in	a	good	way	,	but	they	do	.
what	about	art	?
could	art	change	the	world	?
i	 start 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	15	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	at	that	time	,	i	was	not	 think 	 ing 	 	about	changing	the	world	.
i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	graffiti	--	writing	my	name	 every 	 where 	 	,	using	the	city	 a 	 s 	 	a	canvas	.
i	was	going	in	the	 tunnel 	 s 	 	of	paris	,	on	the	 roof 	 top 	 s 	 	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
each	trip	was	an	 ex 	 cur 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	was	an	adventure	.
it	was	like	 leav 	 ing 	 	our	mark	on	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	to	say	,	``	i	was	here	,	``	on	the	top	of	a	building	.
so	when	i	found	a	cheap	camera	on	the	 sub 	 way 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 document 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 adventure 	 s 	 	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 g 	 ave 	 	them	back	 a 	 s 	 	 photo 	 copies 	 	--	 re 	 ally 	 	small	 photo 	 s 	 	just	that	 s 	 ize 	 	.
that	's	how	,	at	17	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 past 	 ing 	 	them	.
and	i	did	my	first	``	expo	de	 ru 	 e 	 	,	``	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 side 	 walk 	 	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
and	i	 frame 	 d 	 	it	with	color	so	you	would	not	 con 	 fuse 	 	it	with	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
i	mean	,	the	city	's	the	best	 gall 	 ery 	 	i	could	imagine	.
i	would	never	have	to	make	a	book	and	then	present	it	to	a	 gall 	 ery 	 	and	let	them	decide	if	my	work	was	nice	 en 	 ough 	 	to	show	it	to	people	.
i	would	control	it	 direct 	 ly 	 	with	the	public	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	paris	.
i	would	change	--	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 place 	 s 	 	i	would	go	--	the	title	of	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	.
that	's	on	the	champs	-	elysees	.
i	was	 quit 	 e 	 	proud	of	that	one	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	just	18	and	i	was	just	up	there	on	the	top	of	the	champs	-	elysees	.
then	when	the	photo	left	,	the	frame	was	still	there	.
november	2005	:	the	 street 	 s 	 	are	 burn 	 ing 	 	.
a	large	wave	of	 riot 	 s 	 	had	broken	 in 	 to 	 	the	first	 project 	 s 	 	of	paris	.
 every 	 one 	 	was	 glu 	 ed 	 	to	the	tv	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	 disturb 	 ing 	 	,	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 image 	 s 	 	taken	from	the	edge	of	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
i	mean	,	these	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	control	,	 throw 	 ing 	 	molotov	 cock 	 tail 	 s 	 	,	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	 cop 	 s 	 	and	the	 fire 	 men 	 	,	 loot 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	they	could	in	the	 shop 	 s 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	 criminal 	 s 	 	,	 crook 	 s 	 	,	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	 pur 	 suing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	environment	.
and	then	i	saw	it	--	could	it	be	possible	?	--	my	photo	on	a	wall	 reveal 	 ed 	 	by	a	 burn 	 ing 	 	car	--	a	 past 	 ing 	 	i	'd	 d 	 one 	 	a	year	 ear 	 lier 	 	--	an	 il 	 legal 	 	one	--	still	there	.
i	mean	,	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	 face 	 s 	 	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
i	know	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	.
all	of	them	are	not	 angel 	 s 	 	,	but	they	're	not	 mon 	 sters 	 	either	.
so	it	was	kind	of	weird	to	see	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 star 	 e 	 	back	at	me	through	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
so	i	went	back	there	with	a	28	mm	lens	.
it	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	i	had	at	that	time	.
but	with	that	lens	,	you	have	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	10	 inch 	 es 	 	from	the	person	.
so	you	can	do	it	 on 	 ly 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	trust	.
so	i	took	four	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	people	from	le	bosquet	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	making	 scar 	 y 	 	 face 	 s 	 	to	play	the	 caricatur 	 e 	 	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	then	i	 past 	 ed 	 	huge	 post 	 ers 	 	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	bourgeois	area	of	paris	with	the	name	,	age	,	even	building	number	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	was	 dis 	 play 	 ed 	 	in	front	of	the	city	hall	of	paris	.
and	we	go	from	took	 image 	 s 	 	,	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stole 	 n 	 	and	 distort 	 ed 	 	by	the	media	,	who	's	now	 proud 	 ly 	 	taking	over	his	own	image	.
that	's	where	i	 real 	 ized 	 	the	power	of	paper	and	glue	.
so	could	art	change	the	world	?
a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	was	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	all	the	noise	about	the	middle	east	conflict	.
i	mean	,	at	that	time	,	trust	me	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 refer 	 ring 	 	to	the	israeli	and	palestinian	conflict	.
so	with	my	friend	marco	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	there	and	see	who	are	the	real	palestinians	and	who	are	the	real	israelis	.
are	they	so	different	?
when	we	got	there	,	we	just	went	in	the	street	,	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	people	 every 	 where 	 	,	and	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	bit	different	from	the	rhetoric	we	heard	in	the	media	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	palestinians	and	israelis	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	 job 	 s 	 	--	taxi	-	driver	,	lawyer	,	 cook 	 s 	 	.
 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	make	a	face	 a 	 s 	 	a	sign	of	 commit 	 ment 	 	.
not	a	 s 	 mile 	 	--	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	tell	about	who	you	are	and	what	you	feel	.
they	all	 accept 	 ed 	 	to	be	 past 	 ed 	 	next	to	the	other	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	paste	in	eight	israeli	and	palestinian	cities	and	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	wall	.
we	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	art	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	ever	.
we	 call 	 ed 	 	the	project	face	2	face	.
the	 expert 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	way	.
the	people	will	not	accept	.
the	 arm 	 y 	 	will	shoot	you	,	and	hamas	will	kidnap	you	.	``
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	let	's	try	and	push	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	.	``
i	love	the	way	that	people	will	ask	me	,	``	how	big	will	my	photo	be	?	``
``	it	will	be	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	your	house	.	``
when	we	did	the	wall	,	we	did	the	palestinian	side	.
so	we	 arriv 	 ed 	 	with	just	our	 lad 	 d 	 ers 	 	and	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	high	 en 	 ough 	 	.
and	so	palestinians	 guy 	 s 	 	say	,	``	calm	down	.	no	wait	.	i	'm	going	to	find	you	a	solution	.	``
so	he	went	to	the	church	of	nativity	and	 br 	 ought 	 	back	an	old	 lad 	 der 	 	that	was	so	old	that	it	could	have	 s 	 een 	 	jesus	 be 	 ing 	 	born	.
we	did	face	2	face	with	 on 	 ly 	 	six	 friend 	 s 	 	,	two	 lad 	 d 	 ers 	 	,	two	 brush 	 es 	 	,	a	 rent 	 ed 	 	car	,	a	camera	and	20,000	square	feet	of	paper	.
we	had	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	help	from	all	 walk 	 s 	 	of	life	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	that	's	palestine	.
we	're	in	ramallah	right	now	.
we	're	 past 	 ing 	 	 portrait 	 s 	 	--	so	both	 portrait 	 s 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	in	a	 crowd 	 ed 	 	market	.
people	come	around	us	and	start	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?	``
``	oh	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	an	art	project	and	we	are	placing	an	israeli	and	a	palestinian	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	job	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 one 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	two	taxi	-	 driver 	 s 	 	.	``
and	then	there	was	 al 	 ways 	 	a	silence	.
``	you	mean	you	're	 past 	 ing 	 	an	israeli	face	--	 do 	 ing 	 	a	face	--	right	here	?	``
``	well	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	part	of	the	project	.	``
and	i	would	 al 	 ways 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	that	moment	,	and	we	would	ask	them	,	``	so	can	you	tell	me	who	is	who	?	``
and	most	of	them	could	n't	say	.
we	even	 past 	 ed 	 	on	israeli	 militar 	 y 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
when	you	paste	an	image	,	it	's	just	paper	and	glue	.
people	can	tear	it	,	tag	on	it	,	or	even	 pe 	 e 	 	on	it	--	some	are	a	bit	high	for	that	,	i	agree	--	but	the	people	in	the	street	,	they	are	the	 cur 	 ator 	 	.
the	rain	and	the	wind	will	take	them	off	 any 	 way 	 	.
they	are	not	 me 	 ant 	 	to	stay	.
but	 exact 	 ly 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	after	,	the	 photo 	 s 	 	,	most	of	them	are	still	there	.
face	2	face	 demonst 	 rated 	 	that	what	we	thought	 im 	 possible 	 	was	possible	--	and	,	you	know	what	,	even	easy	.
we	did	n't	push	the	limit	;	we	just	 show 	 ed 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	further	than	 any 	 one 	 	thought	.
in	the	middle	east	,	i	 experience 	 d 	 	my	work	in	 place 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	[	 man 	 y 	 	]	 museum 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	direction	in	the	street	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	further	in	 th 	 is 	 	direction	and	go	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	zero	 museum 	 s 	 	.
when	you	go	in	these	 develop 	 ing 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	women	are	the	 pillar 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	community	,	but	the	men	are	still	the	 one 	 s 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	inspired	to	create	a	project	where	men	will	pay	tribute	to	women	by	 post 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	.
i	 call 	 ed 	 	that	project	women	are	heroes	.
when	i	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	all	the	 st 	 ories 	 	 every 	 where 	 	i	went	on	the	 continent 	 s 	 	,	i	could	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	understand	the	 complic 	 ated 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	conflict	.
i	just	 observ 	 ed 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	there	was	no	 word 	 s 	 	,	no	sentence	,	just	 tear 	 s 	 	.
i	just	took	 the 	 ir 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	and	 past 	 ed 	 	them	.
women	are	heroes	took	me	around	the	world	.
most	of	the	 place 	 s 	 	i	went	to	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	there	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	heard	about	it	through	the	media	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	june	2008	,	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	tv	in	paris	,	and	then	i	heard	about	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	rio	de	janeiro	--	the	first	favela	of	brazil	named	providencia	.
three	 kid 	 s 	 	--	that	was	three	 student 	 s 	 	--	 we 	 re 	 	[	 de 	 tain 	 ed 	 	]	by	the	 arm 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 carry 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 arm 	 y 	 	took	them	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	to	the	police	station	,	they	 br 	 ought 	 	them	to	an	 ene 	 my 	 	favela	where	they	get	 chop 	 ped 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
all	brazil	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
i	heard	it	was	one	of	the	most	violent	 favela 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	largest	drug	 cart 	 el 	 	 control 	 s 	 	it	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	there	.
when	i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	--	i	mean	,	i	did	n't	have	any	contact	with	any	ngo	.
there	was	 non 	 e 	 	in	place	--	no	tourist	agent	,	no	ngos	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	--	no	eyewitnesses	.
so	we	just	 walk 	 ed 	 	around	,	and	we	met	a	woman	,	and	i	 show 	 ed 	 	her	my	book	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	?
we	're	 hung 	 ry 	 	for	culture	.
we	need	culture	out	there	.	``
so	i	went	out	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
i	just	took	a	few	 photo 	 s 	 	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	the	next	day	i	came	with	the	 post 	 ers 	 	and	we	 past 	 ed 	 	them	.
the	day	after	,	i	came	back	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 scratch 	 ed 	 	.
but	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	them	to	feel	that	 th 	 is 	 	art	 belong 	 s 	 	to	them	.
then	the	next	day	,	i	held	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	on	the	main	square	and	some	women	came	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	all	linked	to	the	three	 kid 	 s 	 	that	got	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
there	was	the	mother	,	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	the	best	friend	--	they	all	 want 	 ed 	 	to	shout	the	story	.
after	that	day	,	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	favela	 g 	 ave 	 	me	the	green	light	.
i	took	more	 photo 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	the	project	.
the	drug	 lord 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	us	 film 	 ing 	 	in	the	place	,	so	i	told	them	,	``	you	know	what	?
i	'm	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 film 	 ing 	 	the	violence	and	the	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
you	see	that	 en 	 ough 	 	in	the	media	.
what	i	want	to	show	is	the	 in 	 credible 	 	life	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	it	around	me	the	last	few	 day 	 s 	 	.	``
so	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 symbol 	 ic 	 	 past 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	first	one	we	did	that	you	could	n't	see	from	the	city	.
and	that	's	where	the	three	 kid 	 s 	 	got	 arrest 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	's	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	of	one	of	them	.
and	on	that	 stair 	 s 	 	,	that	's	where	the	 traffic 	 ker 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	stand	and	there	's	a	lot	of	 ex 	 change 	 	of	fire	.
 every 	 one 	 	there	 under 	 stood 	 	the	project	.
and	then	we	 past 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	--	the	whole	hill	.
what	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	media	could	n't	get	in	.
i	mean	,	you	should	see	that	.
they	would	have	to	film	us	from	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	distance	by	helicopter	and	then	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	lens	,	and	we	would	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	on	tv	,	 past 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	would	put	a	number	:	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	call	 th 	 is 	 	number	if	you	know	what	's	going	on	in	providencia	.	``
we	just	did	a	project	and	then	left	so	the	media	would	n't	know	.
so	how	can	we	know	about	the	project	?
so	they	had	to	go	and	find	the	women	and	get	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	from	them	.
so	you	create	a	bridge	between	the	media	and	the	 anonym 	 ous 	 	women	.
we	 ke 	 pt 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	.
we	went	to	africa	,	sudan	,	sierra	leone	,	liberia	,	kenya	.
in	war	-	torn	 place 	 s 	 	like	monrovia	,	people	come	straight	to	you	.
i	mean	,	they	want	to	know	what	you	're	up	to	.
they	 ke 	 pt 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	,	``	what	is	the	purpose	of	your	project	?
are	you	an	ngo	?	are	you	the	media	?	``
art	.	just	 do 	 ing 	 	art	.
some	people	question	,	``	why	is	it	in	black	and	white	?
do	n't	you	have	color	in	france	?	``
or	they	tell	you	,	``	are	these	people	all	dead	?	``
some	who	 under 	 stood 	 	the	project	would	explain	it	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	to	a	man	who	did	not	understand	,	i	heard	 some 	 one 	 	say	,	``	you	know	,	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	for	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	,	 discuss 	 ing 	 	with	your	 fellow 	 s 	 	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	you	have	n't	thought	about	what	you	're	going	to	eat	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	art	.	``
i	think	it	's	people	's	curiosity	that	 motiv 	 ates 	 	them	to	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 project 	 s 	 	.
and	then	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	.
it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 desir 	 e 	 	,	a	need	,	an	 arm 	 or 	 	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	bridge	that	's	in	monrovia	,	an	ex	-	rebel	soldier	 help 	 ed 	 	us	 past 	 ing 	 	a	portrait	of	a	woman	that	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	war	.
women	are	 al 	 ways 	 	the	first	 one 	 s 	 	 target 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	conflict	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	kibera	,	kenya	,	one	of	the	largest	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	of	africa	.
you	might	have	 s 	 een 	 	 image 	 s 	 	about	the	post	-	election	violence	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	in	2008	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	we	 cover 	 ed 	 	the	 roof 	 s 	 	of	the	 house 	 s 	 	,	but	we	did	n't	use	paper	,	 be 	 cause 	 	paper	 do 	 es 	 	n't	prevent	the	rain	from	 leak 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	house	--	vinyl	 do 	 es 	 	.
then	art	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
so	the	people	 ke 	 pt 	 	it	.
you	know	what	i	love	is	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	you	see	the	 big 	 gest 	 	eye	there	,	there	are	so	[	 man 	 y 	 	]	 house 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
and	i	went	there	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	--	 photo 	 s 	 	are	still	there	--	and	it	was	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	a	piece	of	the	eye	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	people	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
``	oh	,	that	guy	just	 move 	 d 	 	.	``
when	the	 roof 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	,	a	woman	 s 	 aid 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	joke	,	``	now	god	can	see	me	.	``
when	you	look	at	kibera	now	,	they	look	back	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	india	.
before	i	start	that	,	just	so	you	know	,	each	time	we	go	to	a	place	,	we	do	n't	have	a	tourist	agent	,	so	we	set	up	like	 command 	 os 	 	--	we	're	a	group	of	 friend 	 s 	 	who	 arriv 	 e 	 	there	,	and	we	try	to	paste	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
but	there	are	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	just	ca	n't	paste	on	a	wall	.
in	india	it	was	just	 im 	 possible 	 	to	paste	.
i	heard	 cultural 	 ly 	 	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	law	,	they	would	just	arrest	us	at	the	first	 past 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	paste	white	,	white	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
so	imagine	white	 guy 	 s 	 	 past 	 ing 	 	white	 paper 	 s 	 	.
so	people	would	come	to	us	and	ask	us	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	what	are	you	up	to	?	``
``	oh	,	you	know	,	we	're	just	 do 	 ing 	 	art	.	``	``	art	?	``
of	course	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	.
but	you	know	how	india	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	dust	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	and	the	more	dust	you	would	have	going	up	in	the	air	,	on	the	white	paper	you	can	 al 	 most 	 	see	,	but	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	 stick 	 y 	 	part	like	when	you	reverse	a	 stick 	 er 	 	.
so	the	more	dust	you	have	,	the	more	it	will	reveal	the	photo	.
so	we	could	just	walk	in	the	street	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	next	 day 	 s 	 	and	the	 photo 	 s 	 	would	get	 reveal 	 ed 	 	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
thank	you	.
so	we	did	n't	get	caught	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
each	project	--	that	's	a	film	from	women	are	heroes	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
for	each	project	we	do	a	film	.
and	most	of	what	you	see	--	that	's	a	 trail 	 er 	 	from	``	women	are	heroes	``	--	 it 	 s 	 	 image 	 s 	 	,	 photograph 	 y 	 	,	taken	one	after	the	other	.
and	the	photo	 ke 	 pt 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	even	 with 	 out 	 	us	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	,	you	'll	see	the	film	,	and	you	'll	understand	the	scope	of	the	project	and	what	the	people	felt	when	they	saw	 t 	 hose 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	a	big	part	of	it	.	there	's	 layer 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	each	photo	.
 be 	 hind 	 	each	image	is	a	story	.
women	are	heroes	 create 	 d 	 	a	new	dynamic	in	each	of	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	and	the	women	 ke 	 pt 	 	that	dynamic	after	we	left	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	did	 book 	 s 	 	--	not	for	sale	--	that	all	the	community	would	get	.
but	to	get	it	,	they	would	have	to	[	get	]	it	 sign 	 ed 	 	by	one	of	the	women	.
we	did	that	in	most	of	the	 place 	 s 	 	.
we	go	back	 regular 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	in	providencia	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	favela	,	we	have	a	controlled	center	running	there	.
in	kibera	,	each	year	we	cover	more	 roof 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	course	,	when	we	left	,	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	just	at	the	edge	of	the	project	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	what	about	my	roof	?	``
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	come	the	year	after	and	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	the	project	.
a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	point	for	me	is	that	i	do	n't	use	any	brand	or	corporate	 sponsor 	 s 	 	.
so	i	have	no	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	 any 	 one 	 	but	 my 	 self 	 	and	the	 subject 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	for	me	one	of	the	more	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	work	.
i	think	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	result	is	the	way	you	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	certain	part	of	the	work	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	fine	line	that	i	have	with	 image 	 s 	 	and	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
we	just	did	some	 past 	 ing 	 	in	los	angeles	on	 an 	 other 	 	project	in	the	last	 week 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	even	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	cover	the	moca	museum	.
but	 yester 	 day 	 	the	city	 call 	 ed 	 	them	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	tear	it	down	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	taken	for	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	law	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	taken	down	.	``
but	tell	me	,	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	for	what	?
the	people	i	photograph	 we 	 re 	 	proud	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	project	and	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	photo	in	the	community	.
but	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	for	a	promise	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	make	our	story	travel	with	you	.	``
so	i	did	.	that	's	paris	.
that	's	rio	.
in	each	place	,	we	built	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	with	a	story	,	and	the	story	 travel 	 ed 	 	.
you	understand	the	full	scope	of	the	project	.
that	's	london	.
new	york	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	they	are	with	you	in	long	beach	.
all	right	,	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	public	art	project	where	i	do	n't	use	my	 art 	 work 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
i	use	man	ray	,	helen	levitt	,	giacomelli	,	other	people	's	 art 	 work 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 to 	 day 	 	if	it	's	your	photo	or	not	.
the	 import 	 ance 	 	is	what	you	do	with	the	 image 	 s 	 	,	the	 state 	 ment 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	where	it	's	 past 	 ed 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	 past 	 ed 	 	the	photo	of	the	minaret	in	switzerland	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	after	they	 vot 	 ed 	 	the	law	 forbid 	 d 	 ing 	 	 minaret 	 s 	 	in	the	country	.
 th 	 is 	 	image	of	three	men	 wear 	 ing 	 	gas	 mask 	 s 	 	was	taken	in	chernobyl	 original 	 ly 	 	,	and	i	 past 	 ed 	 	it	in	southern	italy	,	where	the	mafia	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	bury	the	garbage	under	the	ground	.
in	some	ways	,	art	can	change	the	world	.
art	is	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	change	the	world	,	to	change	practical	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	to	change	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	.
art	can	change	the	way	we	see	the	world	.
art	can	create	an	 analog 	 y 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	the	fact	that	art	can	not	change	 thing 	 s 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	a	neutral	place	for	 ex 	 change 	 s 	 	and	 discuss 	 ions 	 	,	and	then	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	you	to	change	the	world	.
when	i	do	my	work	,	i	have	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 react 	 ions 	 	.
people	say	,	``	oh	,	why	do	n't	you	go	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	or	afghanistan	.
they	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.	``
or	,	``	how	can	we	help	?	``
i	 p 	 resume 	 	that	you	belong	to	the	second	 categor 	 y 	 	,	and	that	's	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	for	that	project	,	i	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	take	the	 photo 	 s 	 	and	paste	them	.
so	now	my	wish	is	:	i	wish	for	you	to	stand	up	for	what	you	care	about	by	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	a	global	art	project	,	and	together	we	'll	turn	the	world	 in 	 side 	 	out	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 s 	 	right	now	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	room	.
 every 	 one 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	that	wish	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	now	.
so	a	subject	you	're	passionate	about	,	a	person	who	you	want	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	story	or	even	your	own	 photo 	 s 	 	--	tell	me	what	you	stand	for	.
take	the	 photo 	 s 	 	,	the	 portrait 	 s 	 	,	upload	it	--	i	'll	give	you	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	--	and	i	'll	 s 	 end 	 	you	back	your	 post 	 er 	 	.	join	by	 group 	 s 	 	and	reveal	 thing 	 s 	 	to	the	world	.
the	full	data	is	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	--	insideoutproject	.	net	--	that	is	 launch 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
what	we	see	 change 	 s 	 	who	we	are	.
when	we	act	together	,	the	whole	thing	is	much	more	than	the	sum	of	the	 part 	 s 	 	.
so	i	hope	that	,	together	,	we	'll	create	 some 	 thing 	 	that	the	world	will	remember	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 s 	 	right	now	and	 depend 	 s 	 	on	you	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
