well	,	i	'm	 involve 	 d 	 	in	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	physics	.
in	fact	,	 most 	 ly 	 	now	in	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	thing	is	 di 	 stant 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	among	human	 language 	 s 	 	.
and	the	professional	,	 historic 	 al 	 	 linguist 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s	.
and	in	western	europe	 most 	 ly 	 	try	to	stay	away	from	any	long	-	distance	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	big	 group 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 group 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	go	back	a	long	time	,	 long 	 er 	 	than	the	familiar	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
they	do	n't	like	that	.	they	think	it	's	crank	.	i	do	n't	think	it	's	crank	.
and	there	are	some	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 linguist 	 s 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	russians	,	who	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	that	,	at	santa	fe	institute	and	in	moscow	,	and	i	would	love	to	see	where	that	 lead 	 s 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	lead	to	a	single	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	some	20	,	25,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	?
and	what	if	we	go	back	beyond	that	single	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	,	when	there	was	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	a	 com 	 petition 	 	among	 man 	 y 	 	 language 	 s 	 	?
how	far	back	 do 	 es 	 	that	go	?	how	far	back	 do 	 es 	 	modern	language	go	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	go	back	?
chris	anderson	:	do	you	have	a	hunch	or	a	hope	for	what	the	answer	to	that	is	?
murray	gell	-	mann	:	well	,	i	would	guess	that	modern	language	must	be	 old 	 er 	 	than	the	cave	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	cave	 engrav 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	cave	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	and	dance	 step 	 s 	 	in	the	soft	clay	in	the	 cave 	 s 	 	in	western	europe	,	in	the	aurignacian	period	some	35,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	or	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	they	did	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	did	n't	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	modern	language	.
so	,	i	would	guess	that	the	actual	origin	 go 	 es 	 	back	at	 l 	 east 	 	that	far	and	 may 	 be 	 	further	.
but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	all	,	or	 man 	 y 	 	,	or	most	of	 to 	 day 	 	's	 at 	 tested 	 	 language 	 s 	 	could	n't	descend	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	from	one	that	's	much	 young 	 er 	 	than	that	,	like	say	20,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	of	that	kind	.	it	's	what	we	call	a	 bottle 	 neck 	 	.
ca	:	well	,	philip	anderson	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	right	.
you	may	just	know	more	about	 every 	 thing 	 	than	 any 	 one 	 	.
so	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	honor	.	thank	you	murray	gell	-	mann	.
