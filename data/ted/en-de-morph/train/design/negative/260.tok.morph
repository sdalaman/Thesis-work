i	 start 	 ed 	 	 jug 	 gling 	 	a	long	time	ago	,	but	long	before	that	,	i	was	a	 golf 	 er 	 	,	and	that	's	what	i	was	,	a	 golf 	 er 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	 golf 	 er 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	sort	of	 seep 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	 pore 	 s 	 	,	that	i	sort	of	lived	my	whole	life	,	is	process	.
and	it	's	the	process	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	great	 thing 	 s 	 	was	that	my	father	was	an	avid	 golf 	 er 	 	,	but	he	was	 left 	 y 	 	.
and	he	had	a	real	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	golf	,	and	he	 al 	 so 	 	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 mytho 	 logy 	 	about	ben	hogan	and	 vari 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
well	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	at	the	time	,	but	grew	to	know	stuff	about	.
and	that	was	the	 mytho 	 logy 	 	of	skill	.
so	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	love	to	do	is	to	explore	skill	.
and	since	richard	put	me	on	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	with	music	--	i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 do 	 ing 	 	a	project	with	tod	machover	with	the	mit	media	lab	--	it	 relat 	 es 	 	a	lot	to	music	.
but	tod	could	n't	come	and	the	project	is	sort	of	 some 	 where 	 	,	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	the	way	we	thought	,	or	not	.
but	i	'm	going	to	explore	skill	,	and	 jug 	 gling 	 	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	visual	music	,	i	guess	.
ok	,	you	can	start	the	music	,	 thank 	 s 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.	thank	you	.	now	,	 jug 	 gling 	 	can	be	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	;	play	with	skill	and	play	with	space	,	play	with	rhythm	.
and	you	can	turn	the	 mi 	 ke 	 	on	now	.	i	'm	going	to	do	a	couple	of	 piece 	 s 	 	.
i	do	a	big	piece	in	a	triangle	and	these	are	three	 section 	 s 	 	from	it	.
part	of	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	to	try	to	understand	rhythm	and	space	using	not	just	my	 hand 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	a	lot	of	 jug 	 gling 	 	is	hand	-	oriented	--	but	using	the	rhythm	of	my	body	and	feet	,	and	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	 ball 	 s 	 	with	my	feet	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	next	section	was	an	attempt	to	explore	space	.
you	see	,	i	think	richard	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	people	that	are	against	 some 	 thing 	 	.
well	,	a	lot	of	people	think	 juggler 	 s 	 	defy	 gravit 	 y 	 	or	do	stuff	.
well	,	i	kind	of	,	from	my	 child 	 hood 	 	and	golf	and	all	that	,	it	's	a	process	of	 join 	 ing 	 	with	 force 	 s 	 	.
and	so	what	i	'd	like	to	do	is	try	to	figure	out	how	to	join	with	the	space	through	the	 techni 	 que 	 	.
so	 jug 	 gling 	 	 gravit 	 y 	 	--	up	,	down	.
if	you	figure	out	what	up	and	down	 re 	 ally 	 	are	,	it	's	a	complex	physical	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	throw	a	ball	down	and	up	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	but	then	you	add	in	 side 	 ways 	 	.
now	,	i	look	at	it	 some 	 what 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	--	when	you	learn	 jug 	 gling 	 	what	you	learn	is	how	to	feel	with	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	see	with	your	 hand 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	not	looking	at	your	 hand 	 s 	 	,	you	're	looking	at	where	the	 ball 	 s 	 	are	or	you	're	looking	at	the	audience	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	next	part	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	way	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	space	and	rhythm	,	with	the	obvious	 re 	 ference 	 	to	the	feet	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	time	--	where	the	feet	 we 	 re 	 	,	where	the	 ball 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.	so	,	visual	music	:	rhythm	and	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	build	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	now	.
 jug 	 gling 	 	three	 ball 	 s 	 	is	simple	and	normal	.
excuse	me	.
we	're	 juggler 	 s 	 	,	ok	.	and	remember	,	you	're	 trans 	 posing 	 	,	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 sub 	 culture 	 	here	.
and	 jug 	 gling 	 	--	the	 ball 	 s 	 	cross	and	all	that	.
ok	,	if	you	keep	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 assign 	 ed 	 	 path 	 s 	 	you	get	parallel	lines	of	different	 height 	 s 	 	,	but	then	 hope 	 fully 	 	even	rhythm	.
and	you	can	change	the	rhythm	--	good	,	michael	.
you	can	change	the	rhythm	,	if	you	get	out	of	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
ok	?	change	the	rhythm	,	so	it	's	even	.
or	you	can	go	back	and	change	the	height	.	now	,	skill	.
but	you	're	 box 	 ed 	 	in	,	if	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	do	it	up	and	down	that	way	.
so	,	you	've	got	to	go	after	the	space	down	there	.
ok	,	then	you	've	got	to	combine	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	you	have	the	whole	spatial	 pal 	 ette 	 	in	front	of	you	.
and	then	you	get	crazy	.
now	,	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	ask	you	to	try	 some 	 thing 	 	,	so	you	've	got	to	pay	attention	.	 complex 	 ity 	 	:	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	time	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	time	 s 	 low 	 s 	 	down	or	your	skill	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	,	so	your	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	change	.
it	's	 learn 	 ing 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	--	like	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	high	-	speed	car	crash	.
 thing 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 	down	 a 	 s 	 	you	learn	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	learn	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	learn	.
you	may	not	be	able	to	affect	it	,	it	 al 	 most 	 	 drift 	 s 	 	on	you	.	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
but	that	's	the	 close 	 st 	 	 ap 	 proxim 	 ation 	 	i	can	have	to	it	.
so	,	 complex 	 ity 	 	.	now	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	here	are	 juggler 	 s 	 	?
ok	,	so	most	of	you	are	going	to	have	a	similar	 re 	 action 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
ok	?	and	 who 	 ever 	 	 laugh 	 ed 	 	there	--	you	 under 	 stood 	 	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	right	?
no	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	mess	.	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	mess	with	a	guy	there	,	who	's	got	his	 hand 	 s 	 	around	that	mess	,	ok	.
well	,	that	's	what	 jug 	 gling 	 	is	about	,	right	?
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	other	people	ca	n't	do	or	ca	n't	understand	.
all	right	.	so	,	that	's	one	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	which	is	five	 ball 	 s 	 	down	.
ok	?	 an 	 other 	 	way	is	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	you	could	play	with	the	rhythm	.
same	pattern	.
make	it	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 small 	 er 	 	.
make	it	 wide 	 r 	 	.
make	it	 narrow 	 er 	 	.
 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	up	.
ok	.	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	.	 thank 	 s 	 	.
now	,	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	to	is	that	you	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 tact 	 ile 	 	.
i	have	no	idea	how	computer	-	oriented	or	three	-	dimensionally	-	oriented	you	are	,	but	let	's	try	 some 	 thing 	 	.
ok	,	so	since	you	all	do	n't	understand	what	the	five	-	ball	pattern	is	,	i	'm	going	to	give	you	a	little	clue	.
 en 	 ough 	 	of	a	clue	?	so	,	you	get	the	pattern	,	right	?	ok	.
you	're	not	 get 	 ting 	 	off	that	easy	.	all	right	?
now	,	do	me	a	favor	:	follow	the	ball	that	i	ask	you	to	follow	.
green	.
yellow	.
pink	.
white	.
ok	,	you	can	do	that	?	 yea 	 h 	 	?	ok	.
now	,	let	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	let	me	put	you	in	that	area	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 secure 	 	.
you	want	to	do	it	?	 yea 	 h 	 	?	ok	.
 hand 	 s 	 	out	in	front	of	you	.	 palm 	 s 	 	up	,	together	.
what	you	're	going	to	learn	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
ok	?	so	what	i	want	you	to	do	is	just	listen	to	me	and	do	it	.
index	finger	,	middle	finger	,	ring	,	little	.
little	,	ring	,	middle	,	index	.	and	then	open	.
finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	.
a	little	bit	 fast 	 er 	 	.
finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	.
finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	.
all	right	.	a	lot	of	different	 learn 	 ing 	 	 process 	 es 	 	going	on	in	here	.
one	 learn 	 ing 	 	process	that	i	see	is	 th 	 is 	 	--	ok	.	 an 	 other 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	process	that	i	see	is	 th 	 is 	 	--	ok	.	so	,	 every 	 body 	 	take	a	deep	breath	in	,	breath	out	.	ok	.
now	,	one	more	time	,	and	--	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	.	open	.
finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	.	ok	.
shake	your	 hand 	 s 	 	out	.
now	,	i	 assum 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	you	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	at	a	computer	.
ok	?	so	,	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	you	're	going	la	,	la	,	la	,	and	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	ok	?
so	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	do	,	but	in	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	way	.	you	're	going	to	combine	it	.
so	what	i	want	you	to	do	is	--	 finger 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	tell	you	what	to	do	with	your	 finger 	 s 	 	,	same	thing	.
but	i	want	you	to	do	is	 al 	 so 	 	,	with	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	is	follow	the	 color 	 ed 	 	ball	that	i	ask	you	to	follow	.
ok	?	here	we	go	.
so	,	we	're	going	to	start	off	looking	at	the	white	ball	--	and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	which	color	,	and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	tell	you	to	go	with	your	 finger 	 s 	 	.	ok	?
so	white	ball	and	--	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	.	pink	.
finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	.	green	.
finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	.	yellow	.
finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	pink	or	finger	.
pink	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	,	finger	.
all	right	.
how	did	you	do	?	well	?	ok	.	the	reason	i	 want 	 ed 	 	you	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	most	people	face	 through 	 out 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	a	moment	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	a	moment	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
it	's	a	moment	that	you	ca	n't	make	sense	of	.
why	the	hell	should	i	learn	 th 	 is 	 	?	ok	?
 do 	 es 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	 any 	 thing 	 	in	my	life	?
you	know	,	i	ca	n't	decipher	--	is	it	 f 	 un 	 	?	is	it	 challeng 	 ing 	 	?	am	i	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	cheat	?
you	know	,	what	are	you	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	?
you	've	got	 some 	 body 	 	up	here	who	is	the	operative	principle	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	for	his	whole	life	.	ok	?
 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	that	stuff	out	.	but	is	it	going	to	get	you	 any 	 where 	 	?
it	's	just	a	moment	.	that	's	all	it	is	,	a	moment	.	ok	?
i	'm	going	to	change	the	script	for	one	second	.	just	let	me	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	do	n't	need	music	for	it	.	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	time	in	a	moment	.
there	's	a	piece	that	i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	which	was	all	about	that	,	a	moment	.	and	what	i	do	 a 	 s 	 	a	creative	artist	is	i	develop	 vocabul 	 aries 	 	or	 language 	 s 	 	of	moving	 object 	 s 	 	.
what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	for	you	here	,	i	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 trick 	 s 	 	and	i	put	the	 choreograph 	 y 	 	together	,	but	they	're	not	original	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	going	to	start	 show 	 ing 	 	you	some	original	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	come	from	the	work	that	i	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	.	ok	?
so	,	a	moment	,	how	would	you	define	a	moment	?
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	juggler	,	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	create	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 represent 	 ation 	 al 	 	of	a	moment	.
 a 	 hhh 	 	.
all	right	,	i	'm	going	to	get	on	my	 knee 	 s 	 	and	do	it	.
so	,	a	moment	.
ok	?	and	then	,	what	i	did	 a 	 s 	 	a	juggler	was	say	,	ok	,	what	can	i	do	to	make	that	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	dependent	on	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	 an 	 other 	 	dynamic	.
so	,	a	moment	.
 an 	 other 	 	moment	.
excuse	me	,	still	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.	a	moment	that	 travel 	 s 	 	.
a	moment	--	no	,	we	'll	try	that	 aga 	 in 	 	.	it	 separat 	 es 	 	,	and	 come 	 s 	 	back	together	.
time	.	how	can	you	look	at	time	?
and	what	do	you	dedicate	it	to	,	in	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	thing	?
well	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	in	here	,	and	you	can	all	have	a	guess	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	it	is	.
there	's	a	 myster 	 y 	 	.	there	's	a	 myster 	 y 	 	in	the	moment	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	settle	.	and	then	it	's	dependent	on	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	then	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	rest	.	just	a	little	thing	about	time	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 expand 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	piece	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	use	 ramp 	 s 	 	of	different	 parabola 	 s 	 	that	i	roll	the	 ball 	 s 	 	on	while	i	'm	 keep 	 ing 	 	time	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	i	just	thought	i	'd	talk	about	a	moment	.
all	right	.	ok	.	can	we	show	the	video	of	the	triangle	?
are	we	ready	to	do	that	?	 y 	 es 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	piece	that	i	told	you	about	.
it	's	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	piece	that	i	do	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	space	of	a	 geo 	 metric 	 	triangle	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	i	'll	say	about	the	last	session	is	,	you	ever	try	 jug 	 gling 	 	and	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	car	with	your	 knee 	 s 	 	at	120	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	?
the	 on 	 ly 	 	other	thing	is	,	it	was	a	real	shock	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	drove	 motor 	 cycle 	 s 	 	.	and	when	i	 b 	 ought 	 	my	first	car	,	it	 shock 	 ed 	 	me	that	it	cost	three	 time 	 s 	 	more	than	my	 parent 	 s 	 	'	house	.	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	balance	:	constant	 move 	 ment 	 	to	find	an	approach	to	 still 	 ness 	 	.
balance	:	making	up	the	 rule 	 s 	 	so	you	ca	n't	cheat	,	so	you	learn	to	approach	 still 	 ness 	 	with	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	your	body	.
to	have	a	conversation	with	it	.	to	speak	.	to	listen	.
hup	.	now	,	it	's	dependent	on	rhythm	,	and	 keep 	 ing 	 	a	center	of	balance	.	when	it	 fall 	 s 	 	,	going	 under 	 neath 	 	.
so	,	there	's	a	rhythm	to	it	.
the	rhythm	can	get	much	 small 	 er 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	your	skill	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	,	you	learn	to	find	 t 	 hose 	 	 tin 	 ier 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 tin 	 ier 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	.	 thank 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	a	piece	that	is	about	balance	in	some	ways	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	--	oh	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	're	 bor 	 ed 	 	,	not	here	,	here	's	one	use	for	it	.
you	can	go	with	the	``	 stick 	 s 	 	one	``	music	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	certain	kind	of	balance	to	it	,	which	is	all	about	plumb	.
i	 apprentice 	 d 	 	with	a	 carp 	 enter 	 	and	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	plumb	,	square	and	level	.
and	they	 influence 	 d 	 	that	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	next	piece	,	which	i	'll	do	a	little	segment	of	.
``	two	 stick 	 s 	 	,	``	you	can	go	with	it	.	 thank 	 s 	 	.
which	is	 aga 	 in 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	space	,	or	the	lines	in	space	.
 work 	 ing 	 	with	space	and	the	lines	in	space	in	a	different	way	.
oh	,	let	's	see	here	.
so	,	i	'll	come	back	to	that	in	a	second	.	but	 work 	 ing 	 	with	one	ball	,	now	,	what	if	you	attach	 some 	 thing 	 	to	it	,	or	change	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	thing	that	i	made	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	the	idea	of	 curv 	 es 	 	and	 ball 	 s 	 	together	.
and	then	creating	space	and	the	rhythm	of	space	,	using	the	surface	of	the	 ball 	 s 	 	,	the	surface	of	the	 arm 	 s 	 	.
just	a	little	 to 	 y 	 	.	which	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	the	next	thing	,	which	is	--	what	have	i	got	here	?	ok	.	all	right	.
i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	up	to	 some 	 thing 	 	,	the	 new 	 est 	 	thing	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 geo 	 metry 	 	and	the	rhythm	of	shape	.
now	,	what	i	just	did	was	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	--	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	and	the	 circum 	 ference 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	these	 piece 	 s 	 	are	 mathematic 	 al 	 	,	in	that	way	that	i	look	at	a	shape	and	say	,	what	about	if	i	use	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	life	 affect 	 s 	 	my	choice	of	 object 	 s 	 	that	i	try	to	work	with	.
the	next	piece	that	i	'm	going	to	do	--	which	is	the	 cylinder 	 s 	 	piece	,	if	you	want	to	get	that	up	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	cylinder	 seal 	 s 	 	from	about	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	with	 design 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	used	to	roll	over	wet	clay	with	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	great	 design 	 s 	 	.	i	love	 ceramic 	 s 	 	and	all	of	that	.
it	's	a	combination	of	that	,	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	that	,	the	shape	,	and	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	fact	that	they	 protect 	 ed 	 	the	 content 	 s 	 	.
the	second	influence	on	 th 	 is 	 	piece	came	from	 recycl 	 ing 	 	and	looking	 in 	 to 	 	a	tin	can	 recycl 	 ing 	 	bin	and	 see 	 ing 	 	all	that	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 empti 	 ness 	 	.
so	,	if	you	want	to	go	with	the	music	for	 cylinder 	 s 	 	.
 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 geo 	 metry 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	if	you	take	the	circle	and	you	split	it	in	half	--	can	you	run	``	s	-	 curv 	 e 	 	music	?	``
i	'm	going	to	do	just	a	short	version	of	it	.
 circle 	 s 	 	split	in	half	and	 rot 	 ated 	 	,	and	 mytho 	 logy 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	that	piece	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 kine 	 tic 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	in	the	middle	of	it	,	and	i	dance	around	a	small	stage	so	--	two	 minute 	 s 	 	,	just	to	end	?	the	 lat 	 est 	 	piece	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	--	what	i	love	is	that	i	never	know	what	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	why	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	.
they	're	not	 idea 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 instinct 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 lat 	 est 	 	thing	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	--	--	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	--	i	do	n't	know	what	it	is	yet	.
and	that	's	good	.	i	like	not	to	know	for	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	it	 tell 	 s 	 	me	the	truth	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	me	 im 	 posing 	 	the	truth	.
and	what	it	is	,	is	 work 	 ing 	 	with	both	positive	and	negative	space	but	 al 	 so 	 	with	these	 curv 	 es 	 	.
and	what	it	 involve 	 s 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	know	if	my	 hand 	 s 	 	are	too	 beat 	 en 	 	up	to	do	it	or	not	,	but	i	'll	do	a	little	bit	of	it	.
it	 initi 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	off	with	me	 stack 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 bunch 	 es 	 	of	them	,	and	then	 play 	 ing 	 	with	the	sense	of	space	,	of	 fill 	 ing 	 	in	the	space	.	and	then	it	 start 	 ed 	 	changing	,	and	 be 	 come 	 	 fold 	 ing 	 	on	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	then	changing	 level 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	my	attempt	is	to	make	visual	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	not	to	just	make	--	i	'll	try	one	other	thing	.
for	work	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	with	your	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	of	space	and	time	.
now	,	i	do	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	it	's	going	,	but	i	've	got	a	bit	of	effort	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
and	it	's	going	to	change	 a 	 s 	 	i	go	through	it	.
but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	it	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	not	be	the	right	shape	,	and	--	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	shape	,	and	then	i	'll	show	you	the	first	design	i	ever	put	to	it	,	just	to	see	,	just	to	play	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	love	all	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	play	with	.
let	's	see	here	.
to	work	with	the	positive	and	negative	in	a	different	way	.
and	to	change	,	and	to	change	.
so	,	i	'm	off	in	my	new	direction	with	 th 	 is 	 	to	explore	rhythm	and	space	.
we	'll	see	what	i	come	up	with	.	 thank 	 s 	 	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	me	.
