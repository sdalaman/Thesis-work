i	'd	like	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	the	scale	of	the	scientific	effort	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	making	the	 head 	 lines 	 	you	see	in	the	paper	.
 head 	 lines 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	when	they	have	to	do	with	climate	change	,	and	 head 	 lines 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	when	they	have	to	do	with	air	quality	or	smog	.
they	are	both	two	 branch 	 es 	 	of	the	same	field	of	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	science	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	the	 head 	 lines 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	when	the	intergovernmental	 pan 	 el 	 	on	climate	change	,	or	ipcc	,	put	out	 the 	 ir 	 	report	on	the	state	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	system	.
that	report	was	written	by	620	 scientist 	 s 	 	from	40	 count 	 ries 	 	.
they	wrote	 al 	 most 	 	a	thousand	 page 	 s 	 	on	the	 top 	 ic 	 	.
and	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 page 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 review 	 ed 	 	by	 an 	 other 	 	400	-	plus	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 review 	 ers 	 	,	from	113	 count 	 ries 	 	.
it	's	a	big	community	.	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	community	,	in	fact	,	that	our	annual	 gather 	 ing 	 	is	the	largest	scientific	 meet 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	.
over	15,000	 scientist 	 s 	 	go	to	san	francisco	every	year	for	that	.
and	every	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	is	in	a	research	group	,	and	every	research	group	 stud 	 ies 	 	a	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
for	us	at	cambridge	,	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	 vari 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	el	ni√±o	oscillation	,	which	 affect 	 s 	 	weather	and	climate	,	to	the	 a 	 s 	 simil 	 ation 	 	of	satellite	data	,	to	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	from	 crop 	 s 	 	that	produce	 bio 	 fuel 	 s 	 	,	which	is	what	i	happen	to	 stud 	 y 	 	.
and	in	each	one	of	these	research	 area 	 s 	 	,	of	which	there	are	even	more	,	there	are	phd	 student 	 s 	 	,	like	me	,	and	we	 stud 	 y 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	narrow	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	narrow	 a 	 s 	 	a	few	 process 	 es 	 	or	a	few	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	i	 stud 	 y 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	isoprene	,	which	is	here	.	it	's	a	small	 organ 	 ic 	 	molecule	.	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	never	heard	of	it	.
the	weight	of	a	paper	clip	is	 approximate 	 ly 	 	equal	to	900	zeta	-	illion	--	10	to	the	21st	--	 molecule 	 s 	 	of	isoprene	.
but	 de 	 spite 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	small	weight	,	 en 	 ough 	 	of	it	is	 emit 	 ted 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	every	year	to	equal	the	weight	of	all	the	people	on	the	planet	.
it	's	a	huge	amount	of	stuff	.	it	's	equal	to	the	weight	of	 m 	 ethane 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	much	stuff	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	system	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	system	,	we	go	to	all	 length 	 s 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
we	blow	it	up	and	look	at	the	 piece 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	euphore	smog	chamber	in	spain	.
 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	 explosion 	 s 	 	,	or	full	 com 	 bust 	 ion 	 	,	 take 	 s 	 	about	15,000	 time 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	than	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	your	car	.
but	still	,	we	look	at	the	 piece 	 s 	 	.
we	run	enormous	 model 	 s 	 	on	 super 	 computer 	 s 	 	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	happen	to	do	.
our	 model 	 s 	 	have	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	grid	boxes	 calcul 	 ating 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	each	,	on	minute	 time 	 scale 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 take 	 s 	 	 week 	 s 	 	to	perform	our	integrations	.
and	we	perform	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	integrations	in	order	to	understand	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	fly	all	over	the	world	looking	for	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 join 	 ed 	 	a	field	campaign	in	malaysia	.	there	are	 other 	 s 	 	.
we	found	a	global	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	watchtower	there	,	in	the	middle	of	the	 rain 	 forest 	 	,	and	hung	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	worth	of	scientific	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	off	 th 	 is 	 	tower	,	to	look	for	isoprene	,	and	of	course	,	other	 thing 	 s 	 	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	tower	in	the	middle	of	the	 rain 	 forest 	 	,	from	above	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	tower	from	 be 	 low 	 	.
and	on	part	of	that	field	campaign	we	even	 br 	 ought 	 	an	 air 	 craft 	 	with	us	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	plane	,	the	model	,	ba	146	,	which	was	run	by	faam	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	flies	120	to	130	people	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	you	took	a	similar	 air 	 craft 	 	to	get	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	we	did	n't	just	fly	it	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	at	100	 meter 	 s 	 	above	the	top	of	the	 can 	 opy 	 	to	measure	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	--	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	stuff	.
we	have	to	fly	at	a	special	 inc 	 line 	 	in	order	to	make	the	 measure 	 ments 	 	.
we	hire	 militar 	 y 	 	and	test	 pilot 	 s 	 	to	do	the	 maneuver 	 ing 	 	.
we	have	to	get	special	flight	 clear 	 ance 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	come	around	the	 bank 	 s 	 	in	these	 val 	 ley 	 s 	 	,	the	 force 	 s 	 	can	get	up	to	two	gs	.
and	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 harness 	 ed 	 	in	in	order	to	make	 measure 	 ments 	 	while	they	're	on	board	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 air 	 craft 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	any	plane	you	would	take	on	 vac 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	a	 fly 	 ing 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	that	we	took	to	make	 measure 	 ments 	 	in	the	region	of	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	.
we	do	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	to	understand	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	of	one	molecule	.
and	when	one	student	like	me	 ha 	 s 	 	some	sort	of	inclination	or	 understand 	 ing 	 	about	that	molecule	,	they	write	one	scientific	paper	on	the	subject	.
and	out	of	that	field	campaign	we	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	get	a	few	dozen	 paper 	 s 	 	on	a	few	dozen	 process 	 es 	 	or	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	body	of	knowledge	 build 	 s 	 	up	,	it	will	form	one	subsection	,	or	one	sub	-	subsection	of	an	 assess 	 ment 	 	like	the	ipcc	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	have	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	each	one	of	the	11	 chapter 	 s 	 	of	the	ipcc	 ha 	 s 	 	six	to	ten	subsections	.
so	you	can	imagine	the	scale	of	the	effort	.
in	each	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 assess 	 ments 	 	that	we	write	,	we	 al 	 ways 	 	tag	on	a	 summ 	 ary 	 	,	and	the	 summ 	 ary 	 	is	written	for	a	non	-	scientific	audience	.
and	we	hand	that	 summ 	 ary 	 	to	 journalist 	 s 	 	and	policy	makers	,	in	order	to	make	 head 	 lines 	 	like	these	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
