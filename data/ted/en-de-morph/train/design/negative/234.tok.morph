after	i	left	my	 con 	 vent 	 	,	i	'd	 finish 	 ed 	 	with	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	.
i	thought	that	was	it	.
and	for	13	 year 	 s 	 	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	clear	of	it	.	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	an	english	 liter 	 ature 	 	professor	.
and	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	n't	even	want	to	be	a	writer	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	.
but	then	i	 suffer 	 ed 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 care 	 er 	 	 catastroph 	 es 	 	,	one	after	the	other	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	to	bill	moyers	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	we	take	 any 	 body 	 	.	``
and	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 ra 	 ther 	 	controversial	religious	 program 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	went	down	 ver 	 y 	 	well	in	the	u.k.	,	where	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 un 	 popular 	 	.
and	so	,	for	once	,	for	the	 on 	 ly 	 	time	in	my	life	,	i	was	 final 	 ly 	 	in	the	 main 	 stream 	 	.
but	i	got	 s 	 ent 	 	to	jerusalem	to	make	a	film	about	early	christianity	.
and	there	,	for	the	first	time	,	i	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	the	other	religious	 tradition 	 s 	 	:	judaism	and	islam	,	the	sister	 relig 	 ions 	 	of	christianity	.
and	while	i	found	i	 k 	 new 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	these	 faith 	 s 	 	at	all	--	 de 	 spite 	 	my	own	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	religious	 back 	 ground 	 	,	i	'd	 s 	 een 	 	judaism	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 pre 	 lude 	 	to	christianity	,	and	i	 k 	 new 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	islam	at	all	.
but	in	that	city	,	that	 torture 	 d 	 	city	,	where	you	see	the	three	 faith 	 s 	 	 jo 	 st 	 ling 	 	so	 uneasi 	 ly 	 	together	,	you	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 come 	 	aware	of	the	 pro 	 found 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	them	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	other	religious	 tradition 	 s 	 	that	 br 	 ought 	 	me	back	to	a	sense	of	what	 relig 	 ion 	 	can	be	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	enabled	me	to	look	at	my	own	faith	in	a	different	light	.
and	i	found	some	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	course	of	my	 stud 	 y 	 	that	had	never	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	.	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	 day 	 s 	 	when	i	thought	i	'd	had	it	with	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	i	just	found	the	whole	thing	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
these	 doctri 	 nes 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 un 	 proven 	 	,	abstract	.
and	to	my	 astonish 	 ment 	 	,	when	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	other	 tradition 	 s 	 	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	belief	--	which	we	make	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 	about	 to 	 day 	 	--	is	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	religious	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	that	 surface 	 d 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	west	,	in	about	the	17th	century	.
the	word	``	belief	``	 it 	 self 	 	 original 	 ly 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	to	love	,	to	prize	,	to	hold	dear	.
in	the	17th	century	,	it	 narrow 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	focus	,	for	 reason 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	in	a	book	i	'm	writing	at	the	moment	,	to	include	--	to	mean	an	intellectual	 ass 	 ent 	 	to	a	set	of	 pro 	 position 	 s 	 	,	a	 cre 	 do 	 	.
``	i	 believ 	 e 	 	:	``	it	did	not	mean	,	``	i	accept	certain	 cre 	 ed 	 al 	 	 article 	 s 	 	of	faith	.	``
it	 me 	 ant 	 	:	``	i	commit	 my 	 self 	 	.	i	engage	 my 	 self 	 	.	``
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	some	of	the	world	 tradition 	 s 	 	think	 ver 	 y 	 	little	of	religious	 orthodox 	 y 	 	.
in	the	quran	,	religious	opinion	--	religious	 orthodox 	 y 	 	--	is	 dismiss 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	 za 	 nna 	 	:	``	self	-	 indulge 	 nt 	 	 guess 	 work 	 	about	 matter 	 s 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	can	be	certain	of	one	way	or	the	other	,	but	which	 make 	 s 	 	people	 quar 	 rel 	 some 	 	and	 stupid 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ect 	 arian 	 	.
so	if	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	not	about	 believ 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	what	is	it	about	?
what	i	've	found	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	,	is	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	about	 behav 	 ing 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	you	 believ 	 e 	 	in	god	,	first	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
you	 behav 	 e 	 	in	a	 commit 	 ted 	 	way	,	and	then	you	begin	to	understand	the	 truth 	 s 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
and	religious	 doctri 	 nes 	 	are	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	 summon 	 s 	 	to	action	;	you	 on 	 ly 	 	understand	them	when	you	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	practice	.
now	,	 pri 	 de 	 	of	place	in	 th 	 is 	 	practice	is	 give 	 n 	 	to	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
and	it	is	an	 arrest 	 ing 	 	fact	that	right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	,	in	every	single	one	of	the	major	world	 faith 	 s 	 	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	--	the	ability	to	feel	with	the	other	in	the	way	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 even 	 ing 	 	--	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	test	of	any	true	 relig 	 io 	 s 	 ity 	 	,	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	what	will	 br 	 ing 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	the	presence	of	what	jews	,	christians	and	muslims	call	``	god	``	or	the	``	divine	.	``
it	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	the	buddha	,	which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	you	to	nirvana	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	in	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	when	we	feel	with	the	other	,	we	 dethron 	 e 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	center	of	our	world	and	we	put	 an 	 other 	 	person	there	.	and	once	we	get	rid	of	ego	,	then	we	're	ready	to	see	the	divine	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	every	single	one	of	the	major	world	 tradition 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 high 	 light 	 ed 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	--	and	put	at	the	core	of	 the 	 ir 	 	tradition	what	's	 be 	 come 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	.
first	 pro 	 pound 	 ed 	 	by	confucius	five	centuries	before	christ	:	``	do	not	do	to	 other 	 s 	 	what	you	would	not	like	them	to	do	to	you	.	``
that	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	was	the	central	 th 	 read 	 	which	ran	through	all	his	 teach 	 ing 	 	and	that	his	 discip 	 les 	 	should	put	 in 	 to 	 	practice	all	day	and	every	day	.
and	it	was	--	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	would	 br 	 ing 	 	them	to	the	 transcend 	 ent 	 	value	that	he	 call 	 ed 	 	``	ren	,	``	human	-	heartedness	,	which	was	a	 transcend 	 ent 	 	experience	in	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 cruci 	 al 	 	to	the	 mono 	 theism 	 s 	 	,	too	.
there	's	a	famous	story	about	the	great	rabbi	,	hillel	,	the	 old 	 er 	 	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	of	jesus	.
a	pagan	came	to	him	and	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	convert	to	judaism	if	the	rabbi	could	 re 	 cite 	 	the	whole	of	jewish	 teach 	 ing 	 	while	he	stood	on	one	leg	.
hillel	stood	on	one	leg	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	which	is	 hate 	 ful 	 	to	you	,	do	not	do	to	your	neighbor	.	that	is	the	torah	.	the	rest	is	 comment 	 ary 	 	.
go	and	 stud 	 y 	 	it	.	``
and	``	go	and	 stud 	 y 	 	it	``	was	what	he	 me 	 ant 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	in	your	 ex 	 egesis 	 	,	you	must	make	it	clear	that	every	single	verse	of	the	torah	is	a	 comment 	 ary 	 	,	a	gloss	 up 	 on 	 	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	.	``
the	great	rabbi	meir	 s 	 aid 	 	that	any	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	 script 	 ure 	 	which	led	to	hatred	and	disdain	,	or	 con 	 tempt 	 	of	other	people	--	any	people	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	--	was	 il 	 legitimate 	 	.
saint	augustine	made	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	point	.

and	 th 	 is 	 	struggle	to	find	 compass 	 ion 	 	in	some	of	these	 ra 	 ther 	 	 re 	 barb 	 ative 	 	 text 	 s 	 	is	a	good	dress	 rehears 	 al 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	in	 ordin 	 ary 	 	life	.
but	now	look	at	our	world	.	and	we	are	living	in	a	world	that	is	--	where	 relig 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hijack 	 ed 	 	.	where	 terrorist 	 s 	 	cite	quranic	 verse 	 s 	 	to	 just 	 ify 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 atro 	 cities 	 	.
where	 in 	 stead 	 	of	taking	jesus	'	 word 	 s 	 	,	``	love	your	 ene 	 mies 	 	.
do	n't	 judg 	 e 	 	 other 	 s 	 	,	``	we	have	the	 spect 	 acle 	 	of	christians	 end 	 lessly 	 	 judg 	 ing 	 	other	people	,	 end 	 lessly 	 	using	 script 	 ure 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 argu 	 ing 	 	with	other	people	,	 put 	 ting 	 	other	people	down	.	 through 	 out 	 	the	 age 	 s 	 	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	used	to	oppress	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	human	ego	,	human	greed	.
we	have	a	talent	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	for	 mess 	 ing 	 	up	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 tradition 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 insist 	 ed 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	point	,	i	think	--	that	you	could	not	and	must	not	 con 	 fine 	 	your	 compass 	 ion 	 	to	your	own	group	:	your	own	nation	,	your	own	co	-	religionists	,	your	own	fellow	 country 	 men 	 	.	you	must	have	what	one	of	the	chinese	 s 	 age 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 j 	 ian 	 	ai	``	:	concern	for	 every 	 body 	 	.	love	your	 ene 	 mies 	 	.	honor	the	 strange 	 r 	 	.
we	 form 	 ed 	 	you	,	 say 	 s 	 	the	quran	,	 in 	 to 	 	 tribe 	 s 	 	and	 nation 	 s 	 	so	that	you	may	know	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	universal	 out 	 reach 	 	--	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 sub 	 du 	 ed 	 	in	the	 strid 	 ent 	 	use	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	abuse	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	for	 ne 	 far 	 ious 	 	 gain 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	've	lost	count	of	the	number	of	taxi	 driver 	 s 	 	who	,	when	i	say	to	them	what	i	do	for	a	living	,	inform	me	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	cause	of	all	the	major	world	 war 	 s 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.	wrong	.
the	 cause 	 s 	 	of	our	present	 woe 	 s 	 	are	 politic 	 al 	 	.
but	,	make	no	 mistak 	 e 	 	about	it	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	a	kind	of	fault	line	,	and	when	a	conflict	 get 	 s 	 	 ing 	 rain 	 ed 	 	in	a	region	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	can	get	 suck 	 ed 	 	in	and	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	problem	.	our	 modern 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 exceed 	 ing 	 ly 	 	violent	.

and	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 institution 	 s 	 	,	even	 foot 	 ball 	 	,	which	used	to	be	a	 pleas 	 ant 	 	 pa 	 s 	 time 	 	,	now	 cause 	 s 	 	 riot 	 s 	 	where	people	even	die	.
and	it	's	not	surprising	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	too	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	violent	 etho 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	great	deal	,	i	think	,	of	religious	 il 	 liter 	 acy 	 	around	.
people	seem	to	think	,	now	equate	religious	faith	with	 believ 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	that	--	we	call	religious	people	often	 believ 	 ers 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	the	main	thing	that	they	do	.	and	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	 second 	 ary 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	get	 push 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	first	place	,	in	place	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	is	difficult	.	i	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	--	when	i	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	 congreg 	 ations 	 	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	i	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	see	a	 mut 	 in 	 ous 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	some	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	a	lot	of	religious	people	prefer	to	be	right	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
now	--	but	that	's	not	the	whole	story	.
since	september	the	11th	,	when	my	work	on	islam	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 propel 	 led 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	public	life	,	in	a	way	that	i	'd	never	 imagin 	 ed 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	sort	of	go	all	over	the	world	,	and	 find 	 ing 	 	,	 every 	 where 	 	i	go	,	a	 year 	 ning 	 	for	change	.

and	then	one	night	,	priam	,	king	of	troy	,	an	old	man	,	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	greek	camp	incognito	,	 make 	 s 	 	his	way	to	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	'	tent	to	ask	for	the	body	of	his	son	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	is	 shock 	 ed 	 	when	the	old	man	 take 	 s 	 	off	his	head	 cover 	 ing 	 	and	 show 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
and	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	 look 	 s 	 	at	him	and	 think 	 s 	 	of	his	father	.	and	he	 start 	 s 	 	to	weep	.
and	priam	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	man	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 murder 	 ed 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	his	 son 	 s 	 	,	and	he	,	too	,	 start 	 s 	 	to	weep	.	and	the	sound	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 weep 	 ing 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	the	house	.
the	greeks	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	 weep 	 ing 	 	together	 create 	 d 	 	a	bond	between	people	.
and	then	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	 take 	 s 	 	the	body	of	hector	,	he	 hand 	 s 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 tender 	 ly 	 	to	the	father	,	and	the	two	men	look	at	each	other	,	and	see	each	other	 a 	 s 	 	divine	.
that	is	the	 etho 	 s 	 	found	,	too	,	in	all	the	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
it	's	what	is	 me 	 ant 	 	by	 over 	 coming 	 	the	 horr 	 or 	 	that	we	feel	when	we	are	under	threat	of	our	 ene 	 mies 	 	,	and	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	appreciate	the	other	.
it	's	of	great	 import 	 ance 	 	that	the	word	for	``	holy	``	in	hebrew	,	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	god	,	is	``	kadosh	``	:	 separat 	 e 	 	,	other	.
and	it	is	often	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 other 	 ness 	 	of	our	 ene 	 mies 	 	which	can	give	us	 intima 	 tions 	 	of	that	 utter 	 ly 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	 transcend 	 ence 	 	which	is	god	.
and	now	,	here	's	my	wish	:	i	wish	that	you	would	help	with	the	creation	,	launch	and	 propag 	 ation 	 	of	a	 chart 	 er 	 	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 craft 	 ed 	 	by	a	group	of	 inspiration 	 al 	 	 think 	 ers 	 	from	the	three	abrahamic	 tradition 	 s 	 	of	judaism	,	christianity	and	islam	,	and	based	on	the	fundamental	principle	of	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	.
we	need	to	create	a	 move 	 ment 	 	among	all	these	people	that	i	meet	in	my	 travel 	 s 	 	--	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	meet	,	too	--	who	want	to	join	up	,	in	some	way	,	and	 re 	 claim 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	faith	,	which	they	feel	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hijack 	 ed 	 	.
we	need	to	empower	people	to	remember	the	 com 	 passionate 	 	 etho 	 s 	 	,	and	to	give	 guide 	 lines 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	 chart 	 er 	 	would	not	be	a	massive	document	.
i	'd	like	to	see	it	--	to	give	 guide 	 lines 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	to	interpret	the	 script 	 ures 	 	,	these	 text 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 abuse 	 d 	 	.	remember	what	the	 rabbi 	 s 	 	and	what	augustine	 s 	 aid 	 	about	how	 script 	 ure 	 	should	be	 govern 	 ed 	 	by	the	principle	of	 char 	 ity 	 	.
let	's	get	back	to	that	.	and	the	idea	,	too	,	of	jews	,	christians	and	muslims	--	these	 tradition 	 s 	 	now	so	often	at	 log 	 ger 	 head 	 s 	 	--	 work 	 ing 	 	together	to	create	a	document	which	we	hope	will	be	 sign 	 ed 	 	by	a	thousand	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	of	major	religious	 lead 	 ers 	 	from	all	the	 tradition 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
and	you	are	the	people	.	i	'm	just	a	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	scholar	.
 de 	 spite 	 	the	idea	that	i	love	a	good	time	,	which	i	was	 ra 	 ther 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	to	see	coming	up	on	me	--	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	a	great	deal	of	time	 al 	 one 	 	,	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	'm	not	 ver 	 y 	 	--	you	're	the	people	with	media	knowledge	to	explain	to	me	how	we	can	get	 th 	 is 	 	to	 every 	 body 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	on	the	planet	.	i	've	had	some	 pre 	 liminary 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	,	and	archbishop	desmond	tutu	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	give	his	name	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	is	imam	feisal	rauf	,	the	imam	in	new	york	city	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	i	would	be	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	alliance	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	at	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
i	was	part	of	that	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	alliance	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	which	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	kofi	annan	to	 diagnos 	 e 	 	the	 cause 	 s 	 	of	 extrem 	 ism 	 	,	and	to	give	practical	 guide 	 lines 	 	to	member	 state 	 s 	 	about	how	to	avoid	the	 escal 	 ation 	 	of	further	 extrem 	 ism 	 	.
and	the	alliance	 ha 	 s 	 	told	me	that	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	work	with	it	.
the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	i	can	see	some	of	you	 start 	 ing 	 	to	look	 worri 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	think	it	's	a	 s 	 low 	 	and	 cum 	 ber 	 some 	 	body	--	but	what	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	can	do	is	give	us	some	 neutral 	 ity 	 	,	so	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	western	or	a	christian	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	but	that	it	's	coming	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	from	the	world	--	who	would	help	with	the	sort	of	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	i	do	urge	you	to	join	me	in	making	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	 chart 	 er 	 	--	to	building	 th 	 is 	 	 chart 	 er 	 	,	 launch 	 ing 	 	it	and	 propag 	 ating 	 	it	so	that	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	--	i	'd	like	to	see	it	in	every	college	,	every	church	,	every	mosque	,	every	 s 	 y 	 nag 	 ogue 	 	in	the	world	,	so	that	people	can	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	tradition	,	 re 	 claim 	 	it	,	and	make	 relig 	 ion 	 	a	source	of	peace	in	the	world	,	which	it	can	and	should	be	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
