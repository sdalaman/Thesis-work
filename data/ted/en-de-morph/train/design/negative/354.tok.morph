a	year	ago	,	i	spoke	to	you	about	a	book	that	i	was	just	in	the	process	of	 comple 	 ting 	 	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	come	out	in	the	 inter 	 im 	 	,	and	i	would	like	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	some	of	the	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 ies 	 	that	that	book	inspired	.
the	book	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	blank	 s 	 late 	 	,	``	based	on	the	popular	idea	that	the	human	mind	is	a	blank	 s 	 late 	 	,	and	that	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	structure	 come 	 s 	 	from	 social 	 ization 	 	,	culture	,	 parent 	 ing 	 	,	experience	.
the	``	blank	 s 	 late 	 	``	was	an	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	idea	in	the	20th	century	.
here	are	a	few	 quote 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ating 	 	that	:	``	man	 ha 	 s 	 	no	nature	,	``	from	the	historian	jose	ortega	y	gasset	;	``	man	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 instinct 	 s 	 	,	``	from	the	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	ashley	montagu	;	``	the	human	brain	is	 cap 	 able 	 	of	a	full	range	of	 behavior 	 s 	 	and	 pre 	 dispos 	 ed 	 	to	 non 	 e 	 	,	``	from	the	late	scientist	stephen	jay	gould	.
there	are	a	number	of	 reason 	 s 	 	to	doubt	that	the	human	mind	is	a	blank	 s 	 late 	 	,	and	some	of	them	just	come	from	common	sense	.
 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	told	me	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	had	more	than	one	child	 know 	 s 	 	that	 kid 	 s 	 	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	with	certain	 temperament 	 s 	 	and	 talent 	 s 	 	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	all	come	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
oh	,	and	 any 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	both	a	child	and	a	house	pet	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	that	the	child	,	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	speech	,	will	 acquir 	 e 	 	a	human	language	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	house	pet	wo	n't	,	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	some	innate	different	between	them	.
and	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	ever	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	 hetero 	 sexual 	 	relationship	 know 	 s 	 	that	the	 mind 	 s 	 	of	men	and	the	 mind 	 s 	 	of	women	are	not	 in 	 distinguish 	 able 	 	.
there	are	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	think	,	increasing	 result 	 s 	 	from	the	scientific	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	that	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	're	not	born	blank	 s 	 late 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	,	from	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	,	is	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	human	 universal 	 s 	 	.
if	you	've	ever	taken	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	,	you	know	that	it	's	a	--	kind	of	an	 occupation 	 al 	 	pleasure	of	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	to	show	how	 ex 	 otic 	 	other	 culture 	 s 	 	can	be	,	and	that	there	are	 place 	 s 	 	out	there	where	,	 suppose 	 d 	 ly 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	to	the	way	it	is	here	.
but	if	you	 in 	 stead 	 	look	at	what	is	common	to	the	world	's	 culture 	 s 	 	,	you	find	that	there	is	an	 enormous 	 ly 	 	rich	set	of	 behavior 	 s 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	ways	of	 con 	 s 	 tru 	 ing 	 	the	world	that	can	be	found	in	all	of	the	world	's	6,000	-	odd	 culture 	 s 	 	.
the	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	donald	 brow 	 n 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	list	them	all	,	and	they	range	from	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	,	 affect 	 ion 	 	and	age	 stat 	 uses 	 	all	the	way	down	to	 wean 	 ing 	 	,	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	weather	,	 attempt 	 s 	 	to	control	,	the	color	white	and	a	 world 	 view 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	 genetic 	 s 	 	and	 neuro 	 science 	 	are	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	that	the	brain	is	 intric 	 ate 	 ly 	 	 structure 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	by	the	 neuro 	 biologist 	 	paul	thompson	and	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	which	they	--	using	mri	--	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	gray	matter	--	that	is	,	the	 out 	 er 	 	layer	of	the	cortex	--	in	a	large	 s 	 ample 	 	of	 pair 	 s 	 	of	people	.
they	 cod 	 ed 	 	 correlation 	 s 	 	in	the	 thick 	 ness 	 	of	gray	matter	in	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	using	a	false	color	scheme	,	in	which	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	 cod 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 pur 	 ple 	 	,	and	any	color	other	than	 pur 	 ple 	 	 indic 	 ates 	 	a	 statistic 	 ally 	 	significant	correlation	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	pair	people	up	at	random	.
by	definition	,	two	people	 pick 	 ed 	 	at	random	ca	n't	have	 correlation 	 s 	 	in	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	gray	matter	in	the	cortex	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	people	who	share	half	of	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	--	 fratern 	 al 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	large	 amount 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	are	not	 pur 	 ple 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	that	if	one	person	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 thick 	 er 	 	bit	of	cortex	in	that	region	,	so	 do 	 es 	 	his	 fratern 	 al 	 	 t 	 win 	 	.
and	here	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	get	a	pair	of	people	who	share	all	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	--	 name 	 ly 	 	,	 clone 	 s 	 	or	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	see	huge	 area 	 s 	 	of	cortex	where	there	are	massive	 correlation 	 s 	 	in	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	gray	matter	.
now	,	these	are	n't	just	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	anatomy	,	like	the	shape	of	your	ear	 lobe 	 s 	 	,	but	they	have	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	in	thought	and	behavior	that	are	well	 illustr 	 ated 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	famous	cartoon	by	charles	addams	:	``	 separat 	 ed 	 	at	birth	,	the	mallifert	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	meet	 accident 	 ally 	 	.	``
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	there	are	two	 inventor 	 s 	 	with	 ident 	 ical 	 	 contraption 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	lap	,	 meet 	 ing 	 	in	the	 wait 	 ing 	 	room	of	a	patent	attorney	.
now	,	the	cartoon	is	not	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 exagge 	 ration 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	at	birth	and	then	tested	in	 adult 	 hood 	 	show	that	they	have	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 similar 	 ities 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	every	pair	of	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	at	birth	ever	 stud 	 ied 	 	--	but	much	less	so	with	 fratern 	 al 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	at	birth	.
my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	a	pair	of	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	,	one	of	whom	was	 br 	 ought 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	catholic	in	a	nazi	family	in	germany	,	the	other	 br 	 ought 	 	up	in	a	jewish	family	in	trinidad	.
when	they	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	in	minnesota	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	 nav 	 y 	 	blue	 shirt 	 s 	 	with	 epaul 	 ette 	 s 	 	;	both	of	them	 like 	 d 	 	to	dip	 butter 	 ed 	 	toast	in	coffee	,	both	of	them	 ke 	 pt 	 	rubber	 band 	 s 	 	around	 the 	 ir 	 	 wrist 	 s 	 	,	both	of	them	 flush 	 ed 	 	the	toilet	before	using	it	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	after	,	and	both	of	them	 like 	 d 	 	to	surprise	people	by	 sneez 	 ing 	 	in	 crowd 	 ed 	 	 elev 	 ators 	 	to	watch	them	jump	.
now	--	the	story	might	seem	to	good	to	be	true	,	but	when	you	administer	 batt 	 eries 	 	of	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 test 	 s 	 	,	you	get	the	same	 result 	 s 	 	--	 name 	 ly 	 	,	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	at	birth	show	 quit 	 e 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 similar 	 ities 	 	.
now	,	 give 	 n 	 	both	the	common	sense	and	scientific	data	 call 	 ing 	 	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	of	the	blank	 s 	 late 	 	 in 	 to 	 	question	,	why	should	it	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 appeal 	 ing 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	?
well	,	there	are	a	number	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	why	people	have	found	it	 con 	 gen 	 ial 	 	.
the	 fore 	 most 	 	is	that	if	we	're	blank	 s 	 late 	 s 	 	,	then	,	by	definition	,	we	are	equal	,	 be 	 cause 	 	zero	 equal 	 s 	 	zero	 equal 	 s 	 	zero	.
but	if	 some 	 thing 	 	is	written	on	the	 s 	 late 	 	,	then	some	people	could	have	more	of	it	than	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	line	of	 think 	 ing 	 	,	that	would	 just 	 ify 	 	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	and	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	fear	of	human	nature	is	that	if	we	are	blank	 s 	 late 	 s 	 	,	we	can	perfect	 man 	 kind 	 	--	the	age	-	old	dream	of	the	 perfect 	 ibility 	 	of	our	species	through	social	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	,	if	we	're	born	with	certain	 instinct 	 s 	 	,	then	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	of	them	might	condemn	us	to	 self 	 ish 	 ness 	 	,	prejudice	and	violence	.
well	,	in	the	book	,	i	 argu 	 e 	 	that	these	are	,	in	fact	,	non	 s 	 equ 	 iturs 	 	.
and	just	to	make	a	long	story	short	:	first	of	all	,	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 fair 	 ness 	 	is	not	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 same 	 ness 	 	.
and	so	when	thomas	jefferson	wrote	in	the	 decla 	 ration 	 	of	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	``	we	hold	these	 truth 	 s 	 	to	be	self	-	evident	,	that	all	men	are	 create 	 d 	 	equal	,	``	he	did	not	mean	``	we	hold	these	 truth 	 s 	 	to	be	self	-	evident	,	that	all	men	are	 clone 	 s 	 	.	``
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	that	all	men	are	equal	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	,	and	that	every	person	ought	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	,	and	not	 pre 	 judg 	 ed 	 	by	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	 part 	 icular 	 	 group 	 s 	 	that	they	may	belong	to	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	even	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	born	with	certain	 ig 	 noble 	 	 motive 	 s 	 	,	they	do	n't	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	lead	to	 ig 	 noble 	 	behavior	.
that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	human	mind	is	a	complex	system	with	 man 	 y 	 	 part 	 s 	 	,	and	some	of	them	can	inhibit	 other 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	's	 excel 	 lent 	 	reason	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 virtual 	 ly 	 	all	 human 	 s 	 	are	born	with	a	moral	sense	,	and	that	we	have	cognitive	abilities	that	allow	us	to	profit	from	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
so	even	if	people	did	have	 impulse 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 self 	 ish 	 ness 	 	or	greed	,	that	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	in	the	skull	,	and	there	are	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	mind	that	can	 counter 	 act 	 	them	.
in	the	book	,	i	go	over	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 ies 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	and	a	number	of	other	hot	 button 	 s 	 	,	hot	 zone 	 s 	 	,	chernobyls	,	third	 rail 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	--	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 art 	 s 	 	,	 clon 	 ing 	 	,	crime	,	free	will	,	education	,	evolution	,	gender	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	god	,	 homo 	 sexual 	 ity 	 	,	 infant 	 icide 	 	,	 ine 	 quality 	 	,	marxism	,	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	nazism	,	 parent 	 ing 	 	,	 politic 	 s 	 	,	race	,	rape	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	resource	 deple 	 tion 	 	,	social	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	 techno 	 logical 	 	risk	and	war	.
and	 needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	certain	 risk 	 s 	 	in	taking	on	these	 subject 	 s 	 	.
when	i	wrote	a	first	draft	of	the	book	,	i	 circul 	 ated 	 	it	to	a	number	of	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	for	 comment 	 s 	 	,	and	here	are	some	of	the	 react 	 ions 	 	that	i	got	:	``	better	get	a	security	camera	for	your	house	.	``
``	do	n't	expect	to	get	any	more	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	job	 off 	 ers 	 	or	 position 	 s 	 	in	 scholar 	 ly 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.	``
``	tell	your	 publish 	 er 	 	not	to	list	your	 home 	 town 	 	in	your	author	bio	.	``
``	do	you	have	 ten 	 ure 	 	?	``
well	,	the	book	came	out	in	october	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	--	i	like	--	there	was	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	reason	to	be	nervous	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	in	which	i	did	feel	nervous	,	 know 	 ing 	 	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	people	who	've	taken	controversial	 stand 	 s 	 	or	 discover 	 ed 	 	 dis 	 quiet 	 ing 	 	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	the	 behavior 	 al 	 	 science 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	some	of	which	i	talk	about	in	the	book	,	of	people	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 land 	 er 	 ed 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	nazis	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	 assault 	 ed 	 	,	 threaten 	 ed 	 	with	criminal	 prosecut 	 ion 	 	for	 s 	 tumbling 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	or	 argu 	 ing 	 	about	controversial	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	you	never	know	when	you	're	going	to	come	 a 	 cross 	 	one	of	these	 boo 	 by 	 	 trap 	 s 	 	.
my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	a	pair	of	 psycho 	 logists 	 	who	did	research	on	left	-	handers	,	and	 publish 	 ed 	 	some	data	 show 	 ing 	 	that	left	-	handers	are	,	on	average	,	more	susceptible	to	disease	,	more	prone	to	 accident 	 s 	 	and	have	a	 short 	 er 	 	 life 	 span 	 	.
it	's	not	clear	,	by	the	way	,	since	then	,	 whet 	 her 	 	that	is	an	accurate	 general 	 ization 	 	,	but	the	data	at	the	time	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	support	that	.
well	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	they	 we 	 re 	 	 bar 	 rag 	 ed 	 	with	 en 	 rag 	 ed 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	,	death	 threat 	 s 	 	,	ban	on	the	 top 	 ic 	 	in	a	number	of	scientific	 journal 	 s 	 	,	coming	from	 ir 	 ate 	 	left	-	handers	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 advoc 	 ates 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	to	open	 the 	 ir 	 	mail	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	venom	and	 vitupe 	 ration 	 	that	they	had	 in 	 advert 	 ent 	 ly 	 	inspired	.
well	,	the	night	is	young	,	but	the	book	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	out	for	half	a	year	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 di 	 re 	 	professional	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	place	--	i	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 ex 	 il 	 ed 	 	from	the	city	of	cambridge	.
but	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	talk	about	are	two	of	these	hot	 button 	 s 	 	that	have	 arouse 	 d 	 	the	 strong 	 est 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	in	the	80	-	odd	 review 	 s 	 	that	the	blank	 s 	 late 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 receiv 	 ed 	 	.
i	'll	just	put	that	list	up	for	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	,	and	see	if	you	can	guess	which	two	--	i	would	estimate	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	two	of	these	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	inspired	 prob 	 ably 	 	90	percent	of	the	 re 	 action 	 	in	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 review 	 s 	 	and	radio	 interview 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	violence	and	war	,	it	's	not	race	,	it	's	not	gender	,	it	's	not	marxism	,	it	's	not	nazism	.
they	are	:	the	 art 	 s 	 	and	 parent 	 ing 	 	.
so	let	me	tell	you	what	 arouse 	 d 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 ir 	 ate 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	,	and	i	'll	let	you	decide	if	 whet 	 her 	 	they	--	the	 claim 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	that	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	.
let	me	start	with	the	 art 	 s 	 	.
i	note	that	among	the	long	list	of	human	 universal 	 s 	 	that	i	 present 	 ed 	 	a	few	 slide 	 s 	 	ago	are	art	.
there	is	no	 socie 	 ty 	 	ever	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	the	 remote 	 st 	 	corner	of	the	world	that	 ha 	 s 	 	not	had	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	would	consider	the	 art 	 s 	 	.
visual	 art 	 s 	 	--	 decor 	 ation 	 	of	 surface 	 s 	 	and	bodies	--	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	a	human	universal	.
the	 tell 	 ing 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	,	music	,	dance	,	 poet 	 ry 	 	--	found	in	all	 culture 	 s 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 motif 	 s 	 	and	 theme 	 s 	 	that	give	us	pleasure	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	can	be	found	in	all	human	 socie 	 ties 	 	:	a	 pre 	 ference 	 	for	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 form 	 s 	 	,	the	use	of	 re 	 petition 	 	and	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	even	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	specific	 a 	 s 	 	the	fact	that	in	 poet 	 ry 	 	all	over	the	world	,	you	have	lines	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	three	 second 	 s 	 	long	,	 separat 	 ed 	 	by	 pause 	 s 	 	.
now	,	on	the	other	hand	,	in	the	second	half	of	the	20th	century	,	the	 art 	 s 	 	are	 frequent 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	be	in	decline	.
and	i	have	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	10	or	15	 head 	 lines 	 	,	from	 high 	 brow 	 	 magazine 	 s 	 	 deplor 	 ing 	 	the	fact	that	the	 art 	 s 	 	are	in	decline	in	our	time	.
i	'll	give	you	a	couple	of	 represent 	 ative 	 	 quote 	 s 	 	:	``	we	can	assert	with	some	confidence	that	our	own	period	is	one	of	decline	,	that	the	 standard 	 s 	 	of	culture	are	lower	than	they	 we 	 re 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	that	the	 evidence 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	decline	are	visible	in	every	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	human	activity	.	``
that	's	a	quote	from	t.	s.	eliot	,	a	little	more	than	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	a	more	 re 	 cent 	 	one	:	``	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 sustain 	 ing 	 	high	culture	in	our	time	is	 be 	 coming 	 	increasing	 problem 	 atic 	 al 	 	.

that	's	from	robert	brustein	,	the	famous	drama	critic	and	director	,	in	the	new	 re 	 public 	 	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
well	,	in	fact	,	the	 art 	 s 	 	are	not	in	decline	.
i	do	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	will	 a 	 s 	 	a	surprise	to	 any 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	but	by	any	standard	they	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	 flourish 	 ing 	 	to	a	 great 	 er 	 	 ex 	 tent 	 	.
there	are	,	of	course	,	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	art	 form 	 s 	 	and	new	media	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	which	you	've	heard	over	these	few	 day 	 s 	 	.
by	any	economic	standard	,	the	demand	for	art	of	all	 form 	 s 	 	is	 skyrocket 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	tell	from	the	price	of	opera	 ticket 	 s 	 	,	by	the	number	of	 book 	 s 	 	 s 	 old 	 	,	by	the	number	of	 book 	 s 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	the	number	of	musical	 title 	 s 	 	released	,	the	number	of	new	 al 	 bum 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	grain	of	truth	to	 th 	 is 	 	 complain 	 t 	 	that	the	 art 	 s 	 	are	in	decline	come	from	three	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	is	in	elite	art	since	the	1930s	--	say	,	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 work 	 s 	 	 perform 	 ed 	 	by	major	 sym 	 phony 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	where	most	of	the	 re 	 pert 	 ory 	 	is	before	1930	,	or	the	 work 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	in	major	 gall 	 eries 	 	and	 pre 	 stig 	 ious 	 	 museum 	 s 	 	.
in	 liter 	 ary 	 	 critic 	 ism 	 	and	analysis	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	40	or	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 liter 	 ary 	 	 critic 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	kind	of	cultural	hero	;	now	they	're	kind	of	a	national	joke	.
and	the	 human 	 ities 	 	and	 art 	 s 	 	 program 	 s 	 	in	the	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	which	by	 man 	 y 	 	 measure 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	are	in	decline	.
 student 	 s 	 	are	 stay 	 ing 	 	away	in	 drove 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	are	 dis 	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	and	 human 	 ities 	 	.
well	,	here	's	a	 diagnos 	 is 	 	.
they	did	n't	ask	me	,	but	by	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 ad 	 mission 	 	,	they	need	all	the	help	that	they	can	get	.
and	i	would	like	to	suggest	that	it	's	not	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	decline	in	the	elite	 art 	 s 	 	and	 critic 	 ism 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	in	the	same	point	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	which	there	was	a	 wide 	 spread 	 	 deni 	 al 	 	of	human	nature	.
a	famous	 quota 	 tion 	 	can	be	found	--	if	you	look	on	the	web	,	you	can	find	it	in	 liter 	 ally 	 	 score 	 s 	 	of	english	core	 syllabus 	 es 	 	--	``	in	or	about	december	1910	,	human	nature	 change 	 d 	 	.	``
a	 para 	 phrase 	 	of	a	quote	by	virginia	woolf	,	and	there	's	some	debate	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	by	that	.
but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	,	looking	at	these	 syllabus 	 es 	 	,	that	--	it	's	used	now	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	that	all	 form 	 s 	 	of	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	art	that	 we 	 re 	 	in	place	for	centuries	,	or	millennia	,	in	the	20th	century	 we 	 re 	 	 dis 	 card 	 ed 	 	.
the	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	pleasure	in	art	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	human	universal	--	 we 	 re 	 	--	 beg 	 an 	 	to	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	 sac 	 char 	 ine 	 	,	or	 kit 	 sch 	 	,	or	commercial	.
barnett	newman	had	a	famous	quote	that	``	the	impulse	of	modern	art	is	the	 desir 	 e 	 	to	destroy	 beaut 	 y 	 	``	--	which	was	 consider 	 ed 	 	bourgeois	or	 tack 	 y 	 	.
and	here	's	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	 represent 	 ative 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	visual	 depict 	 ion 	 	of	the	female	form	in	the	15th	century	;	here	is	a	 represent 	 ative 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	 depict 	 ion 	 	of	the	female	form	in	the	20th	century	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	there	--	 some 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	in	the	way	the	elite	 art 	 s 	 	appeal	to	the	 sense 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	in	 move 	 ments 	 	of	 modern 	 ism 	 	and	post	-	 modern 	 ism 	 	,	there	was	visual	art	 with 	 out 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	 liter 	 ature 	 	 with 	 out 	 	narrative	and	plot	,	 poet 	 ry 	 	 with 	 out 	 	meter	and	 rhym 	 e 	 	,	 architect 	 ure 	 	and	 plan 	 ning 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 orna 	 ment 	 	,	human	scale	,	green	space	and	natural	light	,	music	 with 	 out 	 	 melo 	 dy 	 	and	rhythm	,	and	 critic 	 ism 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 clar 	 ity 	 	,	attention	to	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	human	condition	.
let	me	give	just	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	to	back	up	that	last	 state 	 ment 	 	.
but	here	,	there	--	one	of	the	most	famous	 liter 	 ary 	 	english	 scholar 	 s 	 	of	our	time	is	the	berkeley	professor	,	judith	 but 	 ler 	 	.
and	here	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	one	of	her	analyses	:	``	the	move	from	a	 structural 	 ist 	 	account	in	which	capital	is	 under 	 stood 	 	to	structure	social	 relation 	 s 	 	in	 relat 	 ively 	 	 homo 	 log 	 ous 	 	ways	to	a	view	of	 hegemon 	 y 	 	in	which	power	 relation 	 s 	 	are	subject	to	 re 	 petition 	 	,	 converg 	 ence 	 	and	 re 	 articul 	 ation 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	the	question	of	 temporal 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 think 	 ing 	 	of	structure	,	and	 mark 	 ed 	 	a	shift	from	the	form	of	althusserian	 theor 	 y 	 	that	 take 	 s 	 	structural	 total 	 ities 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 object 	 s 	 	.	.	.	``
well	,	you	get	the	idea	.
by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	sentence	--	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	parse	it	.
well	,	the	argument	in	``	the	blank	 s 	 late 	 	``	was	that	elite	art	and	 critic 	 ism 	 	in	the	20th	century	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	not	the	 art 	 s 	 	in	general	,	have	 disdain 	 ed 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	pleasure	,	 clar 	 ity 	 	,	 in 	 sight 	 	and	style	.
people	are	 stay 	 ing 	 	away	from	elite	art	and	 critic 	 ism 	 	.
what	a	 puzzl 	 e 	 	--	i	wonder	why	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	controversial	claim	in	the	book	.
 some 	 one 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	 whet 	 her 	 	i	 s 	 tuck 	 	it	in	in	order	to	deflect	 i 	 re 	 	from	 discuss 	 ions 	 	of	gender	and	nazism	and	race	and	so	on	.	i	wo	n't	comment	on	that	.
but	it	 certain 	 ly 	 	inspired	an	 energ 	 etic 	 	 re 	 action 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	university	 professor 	 s 	 	.
well	,	the	other	hot	button	is	 parent 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	 start 	 ing 	 	point	is	the	--	for	that	 discuss 	 ion 	 	was	the	fact	that	we	have	all	 be 	 en 	 	subject	to	the	 ad 	 vice 	 	of	the	 parent 	 ing 	 	industrial	complex	.
now	,	here	is	--	here	is	a	 represent 	 ative 	 	quote	from	a	 be 	 siege 	 d 	 	mother	:	``	i	'm	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	with	 parent 	 ing 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	 lot 	 s 	 	of	physical	activity	with	my	 kid 	 s 	 	so	i	can	instill	in	them	a	physical	 fit 	 ness 	 	habit	so	they	'll	grow	up	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	intellectual	play	so	they	'll	grow	up	smart	.
and	there	are	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	play	--	clay	for	finger	 dexter 	 ity 	 	,	word	 game 	 s 	 	for	 read 	 ing 	 	success	,	large	motor	play	,	small	motor	play	.	i	feel	like	i	could	devote	my	life	to	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	what	to	play	with	my	 kid 	 s 	 	.	``
i	think	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	parent	can	 sympath 	 ize 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	mother	.
well	,	here	's	some	 sober 	 ing 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	about	 parent 	 ing 	 	.
most	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 parent 	 ing 	 	on	which	 th 	 is 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	is	based	are	 use 	 less 	 	.	they	're	 use 	 less 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	control	for	 her 	 it 	 ability 	 	.	they	measure	some	correlation	between	what	the	 parent 	 s 	 	do	,	how	the	children	turn	out	and	 assum 	 e 	 	a	 caus 	 al 	 	relation	:	that	the	 parent 	 ing 	 	shaped	the	child	.
 parent 	 s 	 	who	talk	a	lot	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	have	 kid 	 s 	 	who	grow	up	to	be	articulate	,	 parent 	 s 	 	who	 span 	 k 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	have	 kid 	 s 	 	who	grow	up	to	be	violent	and	so	on	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	few	of	them	control	for	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	 parent 	 s 	 	pass	on	 gene 	 s 	 	for	--	that	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 chance 	 s 	 	a	child	will	be	articulate	or	violent	and	so	on	.
 un 	 til 	 	the	 stud 	 ies 	 	are	 red 	 one 	 	with	 adopt 	 ive 	 	children	,	who	provide	an	environment	but	not	 gene 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	we	have	no	way	of	 know 	 ing 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	these	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	are	valid	.
the	 genetic 	 ally 	 	controlled	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	some	 sober 	 ing 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
remember	the	mallifert	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	:	 separat 	 ed 	 	at	birth	,	then	they	meet	in	the	patent	 off 	 ice 	 	--	 remark 	 ably 	 	similar	.
well	,	what	would	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	if	the	mallifert	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	had	grown	up	together	?
you	might	think	,	well	,	then	they	'd	be	even	more	similar	,	 be 	 cause 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	would	they	share	 the 	 ir 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	,	but	they	would	 al 	 so 	 	share	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	.
that	would	make	them	super	-	similar	,	right	?
wrong	.	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	,	or	any	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 separat 	 ed 	 	at	birth	are	no	less	similar	than	if	they	had	grown	up	together	.
 every 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	to	you	in	a	 give 	 n 	 	home	over	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	no	permanent	stamp	on	your	 personal 	 ity 	 	or	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	.
a	 comple 	 ment 	 ary 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	,	from	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 method 	 ology 	 	,	is	that	 adopt 	 ed 	 	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	 rear 	 ed 	 	together	--	the	mirror	image	of	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	 rear 	 ed 	 	 a 	 part 	 	,	they	share	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	home	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	do	n't	share	 the 	 ir 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	--	end	up	not	similar	at	all	.
ok	--	two	different	bodies	of	research	with	a	similar	 find 	 ing 	 	.
what	it	 suggest 	 s 	 	is	that	children	are	shaped	not	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	over	the	long	run	,	but	in	part	--	 on 	 ly 	 	in	part	--	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	,	in	part	by	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	--	the	culture	of	the	country	at	large	and	the	children	's	own	culture	,	 name 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	peer	group	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	from	jill	sobule	 ear 	 lier 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	's	what	 kid 	 s 	 	care	about	--	and	,	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	 large 	 r 	 	than	most	people	are	prepared	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	,	by	chance	:	chance	 event 	 s 	 	in	the	wiring	of	the	brain	in	 ut 	 ero 	 	;	chance	 event 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	live	your	life	.
so	let	me	conclude	with	just	a	remark	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	to	the	theme	of	 choice 	 s 	 	.
i	think	that	the	 science 	 s 	 	of	human	nature	--	 behavior 	 al 	 	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	 neuro 	 science 	 	,	cognitive	science	--	are	going	to	,	 increasing 	 ly 	 	in	the	 year 	 s 	 	to	come	,	 up 	 set 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 dogma 	 s 	 	,	 care 	 ers 	 	and	 deep 	 ly 	 	-	held	 politic 	 al 	 	belief	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 present 	 s 	 	us	with	a	choice	.
the	choice	is	 whet 	 her 	 	certain	 fact 	 s 	 	about	 human 	 s 	 	,	or	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	are	to	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	 taboo 	 s 	 	,	 forbid 	 den 	 	knowledge	,	where	we	should	n't	go	there	 be 	 cause 	 	no	good	can	come	from	it	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	we	should	explore	them	 honest 	 ly 	 	.
i	have	my	own	answer	to	that	question	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	great	artist	of	the	19th	century	,	anton	chekhov	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	man	will	 be 	 come 	 	better	when	you	show	him	what	he	is	like	.	``
and	i	think	that	the	argument	ca	n't	be	put	any	more	 eloquent 	 ly 	 	than	that	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
