to	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	is	not	a	joke	.
it	's	not	that	simple	.
one	 ha 	 s 	 	to	discover	a	certain	 big 	 ness 	 	in	 one 	 self 	 	.

on	that	self	,	it	should	be	 center 	 ed 	 	--	a	 big 	 ness 	 	,	a	 whole 	 ness 	 	.
 other 	 wise 	 	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	just	a	word	and	a	dream	.
you	can	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	more	 move 	 d 	 	by	 empath 	 y 	 	than	by	 compass 	 ion 	 	.

by	 man 	 date 	 	,	you	can	not	make	a	person	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
you	ca	n't	say	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	love	me	.	``
love	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	discover	.
it	's	not	an	action	,	but	in	the	english	language	,	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	an	action	.
i	will	come	to	it	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	one	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	discover	a	certain	 whole 	 ness 	 	.
i	am	going	to	cite	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	whole	,	which	is	 with 	 in 	 	our	experience	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	experience	.
in	spite	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tragic	life	,	one	is	happy	in	 moment 	 s 	 	which	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	and	far	between	.
and	the	one	who	is	happy	,	even	for	a	 s 	 lap 	 stick 	 	joke	,	 accept 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	scheme	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	which	one	 find 	 s 	 	 one 	 self 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	the	whole	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	known	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 known 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
all	of	them	are	 total 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	discover	your	 whole 	 ness 	 	in	 your 	 self 	 	.
the	subject	--	``	me	``	--	and	the	object	--	the	scheme	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	fuse	 in 	 to 	 	 one 	 ness 	 	,	an	experience	 no 	 body 	 	can	say	,	``	i	am	 deni 	 ed 	 	of	,	``	an	experience	common	to	all	and	 s 	 un 	 dry 	 	.
that	experience	 confirm 	 s 	 	that	,	in	spite	of	all	your	 limit 	 ations 	 	--	all	your	 want 	 s 	 	,	 desir 	 es 	 	,	 un 	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	credit	 card 	 s 	 	and	 lay 	 off 	 s 	 	and	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 bald 	 ness 	 	--	you	can	be	happy	.
but	the	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	the	logic	is	that	you	do	n't	need	to	fulfill	your	 desir 	 e 	 	to	be	happy	.
you	are	the	 ver 	 y 	 	happiness	,	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	that	you	want	to	be	.
there	's	no	choice	in	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 confirm 	 s 	 	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	can	not	be	different	from	you	,	can	not	be	minus	you	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	you	.
you	can	not	be	a	part	of	 whole 	 ness 	 	and	still	be	whole	.
your	moment	of	happiness	 reveal 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ality 	 	,	that	 real 	 ization 	 	,	that	 re 	 cognition 	 	:	``	 may 	 be 	 	i	am	the	whole	.
 may 	 be 	 	the	swami	is	right	.

 compass 	 ion 	 	is	going	to	be	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	is	going	to	be	 limit 	 less 	 	.
you	can	not	command	 compass 	 ion 	 	 un 	 less 	 	you	 be 	 come 	 	 limit 	 less 	 	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	can	 be 	 come 	 	 limit 	 less 	 	,	either	you	are	or	you	are	not	.	period	.

your	own	experience	 reveal 	 s 	 	,	in	spite	of	all	 limit 	 ations 	 	,	you	are	the	whole	.
and	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	is	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	you	when	you	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	world	.
it	is	love	first	.
when	you	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	world	,	the	dynamic	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	is	,	what	we	say	,	love	.

you	express	 your 	 self 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
to	discover	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	you	need	to	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
to	discover	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	give	and	share	,	you	need	to	be	giving	and	sharing	.
there	is	no	 short 	 cut 	 	:	it	is	like	 swimm 	 ing 	 	by	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
