but	we	do	have	the	potential	to	 over 	 come 	 	disease	and	poverty	,	and	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	if	we	have	the	will	.
kevin	kelly	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 accele 	 ration 	 	of	technology	.
that	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	strong	interest	of	mine	,	and	a	theme	that	i	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	for	some	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	my	 techno 	 logies 	 	had	to	make	sense	when	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	a	project	.
that	 in 	 vari 	 ably 	 	,	the	world	was	a	different	place	when	i	would	 introduc 	 e 	 	a	technology	.
and	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	most	 invent 	 ions 	 	fail	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	the	r	&	d	 depart 	 ment 	 	ca	n't	get	it	to	work	--	if	you	look	at	most	business	 plan 	 s 	 	,	they	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	succeed	if	 give 	 n 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	build	what	they	say	they	're	going	to	build	--	and	90	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 project 	 s 	 	or	more	will	fail	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	is	wrong	--	not	all	the	 enabl 	 ing 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	will	be	in	place	when	they	're	 need 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	be	an	 ard 	 ent 	 	student	of	technology	 trend 	 s 	 	,	and	track	where	technology	would	be	at	different	 point 	 s 	 	in	time	,	and	 beg 	 an 	 	to	build	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 model 	 s 	 	of	that	.
it	's	kind	of	taken	on	a	life	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	.
i	've	got	a	group	of	10	people	that	work	with	me	to	gather	data	on	key	 measure 	 s 	 	of	technology	in	 man 	 y 	 	different	 area 	 s 	 	,	and	we	build	 model 	 s 	 	.
and	you	'll	hear	people	say	,	well	,	we	ca	n't	predict	the	future	.
and	if	you	ask	me	,	will	the	price	of	google	be	 high 	 er 	 	or	lower	than	it	is	 to 	 day 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	say	.
will	wimax	cdma	g	3	be	the	 wire 	 less 	 	standard	three	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	?	that	's	hard	to	say	.
but	if	you	ask	me	,	what	will	it	cost	for	one	mips	of	computing	in	2010	,	or	the	cost	to	sequence	a	base	pair	of	dna	in	2012	,	or	the	cost	of	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	 mega 	 byte 	 	of	data	 wire 	 lessly 	 	in	2014	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
there	are	 remark 	 ably 	 	smooth	exponential	 curv 	 es 	 	that	govern	price	performance	,	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	 band 	 width 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	small	 s 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 theoretic 	 al 	 	reason	why	technology	 develop 	 s 	 	in	an	exponential	fashion	.
and	a	lot	of	people	,	when	they	think	about	the	future	,	think	about	it	 linear 	 ly 	 	.
they	think	they	're	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	develop	a	problem	or	address	a	problem	using	 to 	 day 	 	's	 tool 	 s 	 	,	at	 to 	 day 	 	's	pace	of	progress	,	and	fail	to	take	 in 	 to 	 	 consider 	 ation 	 	 th 	 is 	 	exponential	growth	.
the	genome	project	was	a	controversial	project	in	1990	.
we	had	our	best	ph.d.	 student 	 s 	 	,	our	most	 advance 	 d 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	around	the	world	,	we	got	1/10,000th	of	the	project	 d 	 one 	 	,	so	how	're	we	going	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	15	 year 	 s 	 	?
and	10	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	project	,	the	 skeptic 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	still	going	strong	--	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	're	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	and	you	've	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 on 	 ly 	 	sequence	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	whole	genome	.	``
but	it	's	the	nature	of	exponential	growth	that	once	it	 reach 	 es 	 	the	knee	of	the	 curv 	 e 	 	,	it	 explode 	 s 	 	.
most	of	the	project	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	of	the	project	.
it	took	us	15	 year 	 s 	 	to	sequence	hiv	--	we	 sequence 	 d 	 	sars	in	31	 day 	 s 	 	.
so	we	are	 gain 	 ing 	 	the	potential	to	 over 	 come 	 	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	just	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	how	pervasive	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	is	.
the	actual	paradigm	-	shift	rate	,	the	rate	of	 adopt 	 ing 	 	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	is	 doub 	 ling 	 	every	decade	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	our	 model 	 s 	 	.
these	are	all	 log 	 arithmic 	 	 graph 	 s 	 	,	so	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	up	the	 level 	 s 	 	it	 represent 	 s 	 	,	 general 	 ly 	 	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	by	factor	of	10	or	100	.
it	took	us	half	a	century	to	adopt	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	the	first	virtual	-	 re 	 ality 	 	technology	.
cell	 phone 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 adopt 	 ed 	 	in	about	eight	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	you	put	different	communication	 techno 	 logies 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 log 	 arithmic 	 	graph	,	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	radio	,	 tele 	 phone 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 adopt 	 ed 	 	in	 decade 	 s 	 	.
 re 	 cent 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	--	like	the	pc	,	the	web	,	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	--	 we 	 re 	 	under	a	decade	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	chart	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 s 	 	at	the	fundamental	reason	why	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	process	--	and	both	biology	and	technology	are	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 process 	 es 	 	--	 accele 	 rate 	 	.
they	work	through	 interact 	 ion 	 	--	they	create	a	 cap 	 ability 	 	,	and	then	it	uses	that	 cap 	 ability 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	on	the	next	stage	.
so	the	first	step	in	 bio 	 logical 	 	evolution	,	the	evolution	of	dna	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	was	rna	came	first	--	took	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	then	evolution	used	that	information	-	 process 	 ing 	 	 back 	 bone 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	on	the	next	stage	.
so	the	cambrian	explosion	,	when	all	the	body	 plan 	 s 	 	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	took	 on 	 ly 	 	10	million	 year 	 s 	 	.	it	was	200	 time 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	.
and	then	evolution	used	 t 	 hose 	 	body	 plan 	 s 	 	to	evolve	 high 	 er 	 	cognitive	 function 	 s 	 	,	and	 bio 	 logical 	 	evolution	 ke 	 pt 	 	 accele 	 rating 	 	.
it	's	an	inherent	nature	of	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	process	.
so	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	,	the	first	technology	-	creating	species	,	the	species	that	 combine 	 d 	 	a	cognitive	function	with	an	 oppos 	 able 	 	 append 	 age 	 	--	and	by	the	way	,	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 oppos 	 able 	 	thumb	--	so	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 manipul 	 ate 	 	our	environment	with	a	power	grip	and	fine	motor	 coordi 	 nation 	 	,	and	use	our	mental	 model 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	the	world	and	 br 	 ing 	 	on	technology	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	evolution	of	our	species	took	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 work 	 ing 	 	through	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	evolution	used	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	the	technology	-	creating	species	to	 br 	 ing 	 	on	the	next	stage	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	 step 	 s 	 	in	 techno 	 logical 	 	evolution	.
and	the	first	step	took	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	--	stone	 tool 	 s 	 	,	fire	,	the	wheel	--	 ke 	 pt 	 	 accele 	 rating 	 	.
we	 al 	 ways 	 	used	then	the	 lat 	 est 	 	generation	of	technology	to	create	the	next	generation	.
 print 	 ing 	 	press	took	a	century	to	be	 adopt 	 ed 	 	;	the	first	 computer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	designed	pen	-	on	-	paper	--	now	we	use	 computer 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	had	a	 continu 	 al 	 	 accele 	 ration 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	process	.
now	by	the	way	,	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	on	a	linear	graph	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 every 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	but	some	 observ 	 er 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	well	,	kurzweil	just	put	 point 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	graph	that	fall	on	that	straight	line	.	``
so	,	i	took	15	different	 list 	 s 	 	from	key	 think 	 ers 	 	,	like	the	encyclopedia	britannica	,	the	museum	of	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	carl	sagan	's	 cosm 	 ic 	 	calendar	on	the	same	--	and	these	people	 we 	 re 	 	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	my	point	;	these	 we 	 re 	 	just	 list 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 ference 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	that	's	what	they	thought	the	key	 event 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	 bio 	 logical 	 	evolution	and	 techno 	 logical 	 	evolution	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	 form 	 s 	 	the	same	straight	line	.	you	have	a	little	bit	of	 thick 	 en 	 ing 	 	in	the	line	 be 	 cause 	 	people	do	have	 disagree 	 ments 	 	,	what	the	key	 point 	 s 	 	are	,	there	's	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	of	opinion	when	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	or	how	long	the	cambrian	explosion	took	.
but	you	see	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	trend	.
there	's	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	 pro 	 found 	 	 accele 	 ration 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	process	.
information	 techno 	 logies 	 	double	 the 	 ir 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	price	performance	,	 band 	 width 	 	,	every	year	.
and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	explosion	of	exponential	growth	.
a	personal	experience	,	when	i	was	at	mit	--	computer	taking	up	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	less	 power 	 ful 	 	than	the	computer	in	your	cell	phone	.
but	moore	's	law	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	often	identified	with	 th 	 is 	 	exponential	growth	,	is	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 proper 	 ty 	 	of	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	process	of	technology	.
i	put	49	famous	 computer 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 log 	 arithmic 	 	graph	--	by	the	way	,	a	straight	line	on	a	 log 	 arithmic 	 	graph	is	exponential	growth	--	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	exponential	.
it	took	us	three	 year 	 s 	 	to	double	our	price	performance	of	computing	in	1900	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	;	we	're	now	 doub 	 ling 	 	it	every	one	year	.
and	that	's	exponential	growth	through	five	different	 paradigm 	 s 	 	.
moore	's	law	was	just	the	last	part	of	that	,	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	 shrink 	 ing 	 	 transistor 	 s 	 	on	an	 integrate 	 d 	 	circuit	,	but	we	had	electro	-	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 calcul 	 ators 	 	,	 re 	 lay 	 	-	based	 computer 	 s 	 	that	 crack 	 ed 	 	the	german	enigma	code	,	vacuum	 tube 	 s 	 	in	the	1950s	 predict 	 ed 	 	the	election	of	eisenhower	,	discreet	 transistor 	 s 	 	used	in	the	first	space	 flight 	 s 	 	and	then	moore	's	law	.
every	time	one	paradigm	ran	out	of	 s 	 team 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	paradigm	came	out	of	left	field	to	 continu 	 e 	 	the	exponential	growth	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 shrink 	 ing 	 	vacuum	 tube 	 s 	 	,	making	them	 small 	 er 	 	and	 small 	 er 	 	.
that	hit	a	wall	.	they	could	n't	shrink	them	and	keep	the	vacuum	.
whole	different	paradigm	--	 transistor 	 s 	 	came	out	of	the	 wood 	 work 	 	.
in	fact	,	when	we	see	the	end	of	the	line	for	a	 part 	 icular 	 	paradigm	,	it	 create 	 s 	 	research	pressure	to	create	the	next	paradigm	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 predict 	 ing 	 	the	end	of	moore	's	law	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	time	--	the	first	 predict 	 ion 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	2002	,	 un 	 til 	 	now	it	 say 	 s 	 	2022	.
but	by	the	teen	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	 feature 	 s 	 	of	 transistor 	 s 	 	will	be	a	few	 atom 	 s 	 	in	width	,	and	we	wo	n't	be	able	to	shrink	them	any	more	.
that	'll	be	the	end	of	moore	's	law	,	but	it	wo	n't	be	the	end	of	the	exponential	growth	of	computing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 chip 	 s 	 	are	flat	.
we	live	in	a	three	-	dimensional	world	;	we	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	use	the	third	dimension	.
we	will	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	third	dimension	and	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	tremendous	progress	,	just	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	of	 get 	 ting 	 	three	-	dimensional	,	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	to	work	.
we	'll	have	 t 	 hose 	 	ready	well	before	moore	's	law	 run 	 s 	 	out	of	 s 	 team 	 	.
 super 	 computer 	 s 	 	--	same	thing	.
processor	performance	on	 in 	 tel 	 	 chip 	 s 	 	,	the	average	price	of	a	transistor	--	1968	,	you	could	buy	one	transistor	for	a	dollar	.
you	could	buy	10	million	in	2002	.
it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	how	smooth	an	exponential	process	that	is	.
i	mean	,	you	'd	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	result	of	some	 table 	 top 	 	experiment	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	result	of	 world 	 wide 	 	chaotic	behavior	--	 count 	 ries 	 	 accus 	 ing 	 	each	other	of	 dump 	 ing 	 	 product 	 s 	 	,	ipos	,	 bankrupt 	 cies 	 	,	 market 	 ing 	 	 program 	 s 	 	.
you	would	think	it	would	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 er 	 ratic 	 	process	,	and	you	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	 out 	 come 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	chaotic	process	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	we	ca	n't	predict	what	one	molecule	in	a	gas	will	do	--	it	's	 hope 	 less 	 	to	predict	a	single	molecule	--	yet	we	can	predict	the	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	the	whole	gas	,	using	 thermo 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	the	same	thing	here	.	we	ca	n't	predict	any	 part 	 icular 	 	project	,	but	the	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 world 	 wide 	 	,	chaotic	,	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	activity	of	 com 	 petition 	 	and	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	process	of	technology	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
and	we	can	predict	these	 trend 	 s 	 	far	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
 un 	 like 	 	gertrude	stein	's	 rose 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	the	case	that	a	transistor	is	a	transistor	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	make	them	 small 	 er 	 	and	less	expensive	,	the	 electron 	 s 	 	have	less	distance	to	travel	.
they	're	 fast 	 er 	 	,	so	you	've	got	exponential	growth	in	the	speed	of	 transistor 	 s 	 	,	so	the	cost	of	a	cycle	of	one	transistor	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	coming	down	with	a	 halv 	 ing 	 	rate	of	1.1	 year 	 s 	 	.
you	add	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	processor	design	,	you	get	a	 doub 	 ling 	 	of	price	performance	of	computing	every	one	year	.
and	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 defl 	 ation 	 	--	50	percent	 defl 	 ation 	 	.
and	it	's	not	just	 computer 	 s 	 	.	i	mean	,	it	's	true	of	dna	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	;	it	's	true	of	brain	 s 	 canning 	 	;	it	's	true	of	the	world	wide	web	.	i	mean	,	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	 quant 	 ify 	 	,	we	have	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	different	 measure 	 ments 	 	of	different	,	information	-	related	 measure 	 ments 	 	--	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	 adopt 	 ion 	 	rates	--	and	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	double	every	12	,	13	,	15	 month 	 s 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	what	you	're	looking	at	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	price	performance	,	that	's	a	40	to	50	percent	 defl 	 ation 	 	rate	.

these	are	some	 design 	 s 	 	from	eric	drexler	's	book	--	which	we	're	now	 show 	 ing 	 	are	 feas 	 ible 	 	with	super	-	computing	 simul 	 ations 	 	,	where	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	are	 scientist 	 s 	 	building	molecule	-	scale	 robot 	 s 	 	.

there	are	little	 machine 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 experiment 	 al 	 	 base 	 s 	 	.

and	 th 	 is 	 	is	less	 futurist 	 ic 	 	than	it	may	sound	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	 animal 	 s 	 	.
there	's	one	nano	-	engineered	 de 	 vice 	 	that	 cure 	 s 	 	type	1	diabetes	.	it	's	blood	cell	-	sized	.

what	you	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	is	a	design	of	a	robotic	red	blood	cell	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	up	the	issue	that	our	biology	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	sub	-	optimal	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 remark 	 able 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 intric 	 acy 	 	.

 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	we	'll	ban	them	,	but	then	we	'll	have	the	 spect 	 er 	 	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	high	 school 	 s 	 	 gym 	 s 	 	 routine 	 ly 	 	out	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	the	olympic	 athlete 	 s 	 	.

these	are	2020	-	circa	 scenario 	 s 	 	,	but	they	're	not	 a 	 s 	 	 futurist 	 ic 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	may	sound	.
there	are	four	major	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	on	building	blood	cell	-	sized	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	;	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	 animal 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	going	 in 	 to 	 	human	trial	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 feas 	 ible 	 	technology	.
if	we	come	back	to	our	exponential	growth	of	computing	,	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	computing	is	now	 some 	 where 	 	between	an	insect	and	a	mouse	brain	.
it	will	intersect	human	 intellig 	 ence 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	in	the	2020s	,	but	that	'll	be	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	side	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
where	will	we	get	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	?
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	can	see	 in 	 side 	 	the	human	brain	,	and	in	fact	not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	the	spatial	and	temporal	 re 	 solution 	 	of	brain	 s 	 canning 	 	is	 doub 	 ling 	 	every	year	.
and	with	the	new	generation	of	 s 	 canning 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	,	for	the	first	time	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	individual	inter	-	neural	 fiber 	 s 	 	and	see	them	 process 	 ing 	 	and	 signal 	 ing 	 	in	real	time	--	but	then	the	question	is	,	ok	,	we	can	get	 th 	 is 	 	data	now	,	but	can	we	understand	it	?
doug	hofstadter	 wonder 	 s 	 	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	our	 intellig 	 ence 	 	just	is	n't	great	 en 	 ough 	 	to	understand	our	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	and	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 smart 	 er 	 	,	well	,	then	our	 brain 	 s 	 	would	be	that	much	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	and	we	'd	never	catch	up	to	it	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	we	can	understand	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	block	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	a	model	and	 simul 	 ation 	 	of	the	human	 audit 	 ory 	 	cortex	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	well	--	in	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 acoustic 	 	 test 	 s 	 	,	 get 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 result 	 s 	 	to	human	 audit 	 ory 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 simul 	 ation 	 	of	the	 ce 	 rebel 	 lum 	 	--	that	's	more	than	half	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	the	brain	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 work 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 similar 	 ly 	 	to	human	skill	 form 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	at	an	early	stage	,	but	you	can	show	with	the	exponential	growth	of	the	amount	of	information	about	the	brain	and	the	exponential	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	the	 re 	 solution 	 	of	brain	 s 	 canning 	 	,	we	will	succeed	in	reverse	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	the	human	brain	by	the	2020s	.
we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	had	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 model 	 s 	 	and	 simul 	 ation 	 	of	about	15	 region 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	 exponential 	 ly 	 	growing	economic	progress	.
we	've	had	 product 	 ivity 	 	go	from	30	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	150	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	hour	of	labor	in	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
 e 	 - 	 commerce 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	growing	 exponential 	 ly 	 	.	it	's	now	a	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
you	might	wonder	,	well	,	was	n't	there	a	boom	and	a	bust	?
that	was	 strict 	 ly 	 	a	capital	-	 market 	 s 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
wall	street	 notice 	 d 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 revolution 	 ary 	 	technology	,	which	it	was	,	but	then	six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	it	had	n't	 revolution 	 ized 	 	all	business	 model 	 s 	 	,	they	 figur 	 ed 	 	,	well	,	that	was	wrong	,	and	then	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	bust	.
all	right	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	technology	that	we	put	together	using	some	of	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	we	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	be	a	routine	feature	in	a	cell	phone	.
it	would	be	able	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	from	one	language	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	let	me	just	end	with	a	couple	of	 scenario 	 s 	 	.
by	2010	 computer 	 s 	 	will	disappear	.
they	'll	be	so	small	,	they	'll	be	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	our	 cloth 	 ing 	 	,	in	our	environment	.
 image 	 s 	 	will	be	written	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	our	retina	,	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	full	-	 immers 	 ion 	 	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	,	 augment 	 ed 	 	real	 re 	 ality 	 	.	we	'll	be	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	virtual	 personal 	 ities 	 	.
but	if	we	go	to	2029	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	full	 matur 	 ity 	 	of	these	 trend 	 s 	 	,	and	you	have	to	appreciate	how	 man 	 y 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	of	the	screw	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 generation 	 s 	 	of	technology	,	which	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	,	we	'll	have	at	that	point	.
i	mean	,	we	will	have	two	-	to	-	the	-	25th	-	power	 great 	 er 	 	price	performance	,	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	and	 band 	 width 	 	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	which	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
it	'll	be	 million 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	it	is	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	'll	have	 complete 	 d 	 	the	reverse	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	of	the	human	brain	,	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	computing	will	be	far	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	the	human	brain	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	raw	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
 computer 	 s 	 	will	combine	the	subtle	pan	-	 re 	 cognition 	 	 power 	 s 	 	of	human	 intellig 	 ence 	 	with	ways	in	which	 machine 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 super 	 ior 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	analytic	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 remember 	 ing 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 fact 	 s 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	.
 machine 	 s 	 	can	share	 the 	 ir 	 	knowledge	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
but	it	's	not	just	an	alien	invasion	of	intelligent	 machine 	 s 	 	.
we	are	going	to	merge	with	our	technology	.
these	nano	-	bots	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	will	first	be	used	for	medical	and	health	 application 	 s 	 	:	 clean 	 ing 	 	up	the	environment	,	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	fuel	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 wide 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	and	so	on	in	the	environment	.
but	they	'll	 al 	 so 	 	go	 in 	 side 	 	our	brain	,	interact	with	our	 bio 	 logical 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
we	've	 demonst 	 rated 	 	the	key	 principle 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	full	-	 immers 	 ion 	 	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	from	 with 	 in 	 	the	nervous	system	,	the	nano	-	bots	shut	down	the	 signal 	 s 	 	coming	from	your	real	 sense 	 s 	 	,	replace	them	with	the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	your	brain	would	be	 receiv 	 ing 	 	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	virtual	environment	,	and	then	it	'll	feel	like	you	're	in	that	virtual	environment	.
you	can	go	there	with	other	people	,	have	any	kind	of	experience	with	 any 	 one 	 	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	all	of	the	 sense 	 s 	 	.
``	experience	 beam 	 ers 	 	,	``	i	call	them	,	will	put	 the 	 ir 	 	whole	flow	of	 sensor 	 y 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	in	the	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 correlate 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	out	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
you	can	plug	in	and	experience	what	it	's	like	to	be	 some 	 one 	 	else	.
but	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	it	'll	be	a	tremendous	expansion	of	human	 intellig 	 ence 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	direct	 merge 	 r 	 	with	our	technology	,	which	in	some	sense	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
we	 routine 	 ly 	 	do	intellectual	 feat 	 s 	 	that	would	be	 im 	 possible 	 	 with 	 out 	 	our	technology	.
human	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	is	 expand 	 ing 	 	.	it	was	37	in	1800	,	and	with	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 bio 	 technology 	 	,	nano	-	technology	 revolution 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	move	up	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	in	the	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	.
my	main	 mess 	 age 	 	is	that	progress	in	technology	is	exponential	,	not	linear	.
 man 	 y 	 	--	even	 scientist 	 s 	 	--	 assum 	 e 	 	a	linear	model	,	so	they	'll	say	,	``	oh	,	it	'll	be	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	before	we	have	self	-	 replica 	 ting 	 	nano	-	technology	 assem 	 bly 	 	or	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.	``
if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	look	at	the	power	of	exponential	growth	,	you	'll	see	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	at	hand	.
and	information	technology	is	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 compass 	 ing 	 	all	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	from	our	music	to	our	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	to	our	biology	to	our	energy	to	 material 	 s 	 	.
we	'll	be	able	to	 manufactur 	 e 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	we	need	in	the	2020s	,	from	information	,	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 	raw	 material 	 s 	 	,	using	nano	-	technology	.
these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
they	both	empower	our	promise	and	our	peril	.
so	we	have	to	have	the	will	to	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	the	right	 problem 	 s 	 	.
