how	do	 group 	 s 	 	get	 any 	 thing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	?	right	?
how	do	you	organize	a	group	of	 individual 	 s 	 	so	that	the	 out 	 put 	 	of	the	group	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 cohere 	 nt 	 	and	of	 last 	 ing 	 	value	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 be 	 ing 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	?
and	the	economic	framing	of	that	problem	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 coordi 	 nation 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.
and	a	 coordi 	 nation 	 	cost	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	all	of	the	financial	or	 institution 	 al 	 	 difficult 	 ies 	 	in	 ar 	 ranging 	 	group	 out 	 put 	 	.
and	we	've	had	a	classic	answer	for	 coordi 	 nation 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	,	which	is	,	if	you	want	to	coordinate	the	work	of	a	group	of	people	,	you	start	an	institution	,	right	?	you	raise	some	 resource 	 s 	 	.
you	found	 some 	 thing 	 	.	it	can	be	private	or	public	.
it	can	be	for	profit	or	not	profit	.	it	can	be	large	or	small	.
but	you	get	these	 resource 	 s 	 	together	.
you	found	an	institution	,	and	you	use	the	institution	to	coordinate	the	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	the	group	.
more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	cost	of	 lett 	 ing 	 	 group 	 s 	 	communicate	with	each	other	 ha 	 s 	 	 fall 	 en 	 	through	the	floor	--	and	communication	 cost 	 s 	 	are	one	of	the	big	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	to	 coordi 	 nation 	 	--	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	second	answer	,	which	is	to	put	the	 co 	 operation 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	to	design	 system 	 s 	 	that	coordinate	the	 out 	 put 	 	of	the	group	 a 	 s 	 	a	by	-	product	of	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	of	the	system	,	 with 	 out 	 	regard	to	 institution 	 al 	 	 model 	 s 	 	.
so	,	that	's	what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	it	with	some	 fair 	 ly 	 	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 ways 	 	 point 	 ing 	 	to	the	 broad 	 er 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	start	by	 try 	 ing 	 	to	answer	a	question	that	i	know	each	of	you	will	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	 your 	 self 	 	at	some	point	or	other	,	and	which	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	purpose	-	built	to	answer	,	which	is	,	where	can	i	get	a	picture	of	a	roller	-	 s 	 k 	 ating 	 	 mer 	 maid 	 	?
so	,	in	new	york	city	,	on	the	first	saturday	of	every	summer	,	coney	 is 	 land 	 	,	our	local	,	 charm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	run	-	down	 amuse 	 ment 	 	park	,	 host 	 s 	 	the	 mer 	 maid 	 	 para 	 de 	 	.	it	's	an	amateur	 para 	 de 	 	;	people	come	from	all	over	the	city	;	people	get	all	 dress 	 ed 	 	up	.
some	people	get	less	 dress 	 ed 	 	up	.
young	and	old	,	 danc 	 ing 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
 color 	 ful 	 	 character 	 s 	 	,	and	a	good	time	is	had	by	all	.
and	what	i	want	to	call	your	attention	to	is	not	the	 mer 	 maid 	 	 para 	 de 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	 charm 	 ing 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	is	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	to	these	 photo 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	take	them	.	how	did	i	get	them	?
and	the	answer	is	:	i	got	them	from	flickr	.
flickr	is	a	photo	-	sharing	service	that	 allow 	 s 	 	people	to	take	 photo 	 s 	 	,	upload	them	,	share	them	over	the	web	and	so	forth	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	flickr	 ha 	 s 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	an	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	function	 call 	 ed 	 	 tag 	 ging 	 	.
 tag 	 ging 	 	was	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	by	 delic 	 ious 	 	and	joshua	schachter	.
 delic 	 ious 	 	is	a	social	 book 	 mark 	 ing 	 	service	.
 tag 	 ging 	 	is	a	 co 	 operative 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	answer	to	 class 	 ification 	 	.
right	?	if	i	had	 give 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	last	year	,	i	could	n't	do	what	i	just	did	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	could	n't	have	found	 t 	 hose 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	we	need	to	hire	a	professional	class	of	 librarian 	 s 	 	to	organize	these	 photo 	 s 	 	once	they	're	 upload 	 ed 	 	,	flickr	 simpl 	 y 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	over	to	the	 user 	 s 	 	the	ability	to	 character 	 ize 	 	the	 photo 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	was	able	to	go	in	and	draw	down	 photo 	 s 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	``	 mer 	 maid 	 	 para 	 de 	 	.	``	there	 we 	 re 	 	3,100	 photo 	 s 	 	taken	by	118	 photograph 	 ers 	 	,	all	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	and	then	put	under	 th 	 is 	 	nice	,	neat	name	,	 show 	 n 	 	in	reverse	 chrono 	 logical 	 	order	.
and	i	was	then	able	to	go	and	retrieve	them	to	give	you	that	little	 slide 	 show 	 	.
now	,	what	hard	problem	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	here	?
and	it	's	--	in	the	most	schematic	possible	view	,	it	's	a	 coordi 	 nation 	 	problem	,	right	?
there	are	a	large	number	of	people	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	fraction	of	them	have	 photo 	 s 	 	of	the	 mer 	 maid 	 	 para 	 de 	 	.
how	do	we	get	 t 	 hose 	 	people	together	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	that	work	?
the	classic	answer	is	to	form	an	institution	,	right	?
to	draw	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 in 	 to 	 	some	 pre 	 arrange 	 d 	 	structure	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	to	call	your	attention	to	some	of	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	of	going	the	 institution 	 al 	 	route	.
first	of	all	,	when	you	form	an	institution	,	you	take	on	a	management	problem	,	right	?
no	good	just	 hir 	 ing 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	hire	other	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	manage	 t 	 hose 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	and	to	enforce	the	 goal 	 s 	 	of	the	institution	and	so	forth	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	you	have	to	 br 	 ing 	 	structure	 in 	 to 	 	place	.
right	?	you	have	to	have	economic	structure	.
you	have	to	have	legal	structure	.
you	have	to	have	physical	structure	.
and	that	 create 	 s 	 	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.
third	,	 form 	 ing 	 	an	institution	is	 inherent 	 ly 	 	 ex 	 clusion 	 ary 	 	.
you	notice	we	have	n't	got	 every 	 body 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	photo	.
you	ca	n't	hire	 every 	 one 	 	in	a	company	,	right	?
you	ca	n't	recruit	 every 	 one 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 government 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
you	have	to	exclude	some	people	.
and	fourth	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	 ex 	 clusion 	 	,	you	end	up	with	a	professional	class	.	look	at	the	change	here	.
we	've	gone	from	people	with	 photo 	 s 	 	to	 photograph 	 ers 	 	.
right	?	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	professional	class	of	 photograph 	 ers 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	goal	is	to	go	out	and	photograph	the	 mer 	 maid 	 	 para 	 de 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	else	they	're	 s 	 ent 	 	out	to	photograph	.
when	you	build	 co 	 operation 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	which	is	the	flickr	answer	,	you	can	 leav 	 e 	 	the	people	where	they	are	and	you	take	the	problem	to	the	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	moving	the	 individual 	 s 	 	to	the	problem	.
you	arrange	the	 coordi 	 nation 	 	in	the	group	,	and	by	 do 	 ing 	 	that	you	get	the	same	 out 	 come 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	 institution 	 al 	 	 difficult 	 ies 	 	.
you	lose	the	 institution 	 al 	 	 imper 	 ative 	 	.
you	lose	the	right	to	shape	people	's	work	when	it	's	volunteer	effort	,	but	you	 al 	 so 	 	shed	the	 institution 	 al 	 	cost	,	which	 give 	 s 	 	you	 great 	 er 	 	 flex 	 ibility 	 	.
what	flickr	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 replace 	 s 	 	 plan 	 ning 	 	with	 coordi 	 nation 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	general	 a 	 spect 	 	of	these	 co 	 operative 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
right	.	you	'll	have	 experience 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	your	life	 when 	 ever 	 	you	 b 	 ought 	 	your	first	mobile	phone	,	and	you	 stop 	 ped 	 	making	 plan 	 s 	 	.
you	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	call	you	when	i	get	there	.	``
``	call	me	when	you	get	off	work	.	``	right	?
that	is	a	point	-	to	-	point	 re 	 placement 	 	of	 coordi 	 nation 	 	with	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
right	.	we	're	now	able	to	do	that	kind	of	thing	with	 group 	 s 	 	.
to	say	 in 	 stead 	 	of	,	we	must	make	an	advance	plan	,	we	must	have	a	five	-	year	 project 	 ion 	 	of	where	the	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	is	going	to	be	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	you	can	just	say	,	let	's	coordinate	the	group	effort	,	and	let	's	deal	with	it	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	now	well	-	 en 	 ough 	 	 coordinate 	 d 	 	that	we	do	n't	have	to	take	on	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	in	advance	what	to	do	.
so	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 some 	 what 	 	more	 som 	 ber 	 	.
these	are	 photo 	 s 	 	on	flickr	 tag 	 ged 	 	``	 ir 	 aq 	 	.	``
and	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	hard	about	the	 coordi 	 nation 	 	cost	with	the	 mer 	 maid 	 	 para 	 de 	 	is	even	 hard 	 er 	 	here	.
there	are	more	 picture 	 s 	 	.	there	are	more	 photograph 	 ers 	 	.
it	's	taken	over	a	 wide 	 r 	 	 geo 	 graphic 	 	area	.
the	 photo 	 s 	 	are	spread	out	over	a	 long 	 er 	 	period	of	time	.
and	worst	of	all	,	that	figure	at	the	bottom	,	 approximate 	 ly 	 	ten	 photo 	 s 	 	per	 photograph 	 er 	 	,	is	a	lie	.
it	's	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	true	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	talk	about	 any 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	in	these	 system 	 s 	 	,	the	average	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 matter 	 s 	 	.
what	 matter 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	of	 photograph 	 s 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	 ir 	 aq 	 	 a 	 s 	 	taken	by	the	529	 photograph 	 ers 	 	who	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	the	5,445	 photo 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 rank 	 ed 	 	in	order	of	number	of	 photo 	 s 	 	taken	per	 photograph 	 er 	 	.
you	can	see	here	,	over	at	the	end	,	our	most	 pro 	 l 	 ific 	 	 photograph 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	around	350	 photo 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	see	there	's	a	few	people	who	have	taken	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 photo 	 s 	 	.
then	there	's	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	people	who	've	taken	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 photo 	 s 	 	.
and	by	the	time	we	get	around	here	,	we	get	ten	or	 few 	 er 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	,	and	then	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	long	,	flat	tail	.
and	by	the	time	you	get	to	the	middle	,	you	've	got	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	who	have	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	photo	each	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	power	-	law	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
it	 appear 	 s 	 	often	in	 un 	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	social	 system 	 s 	 	where	people	are	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	or	 a 	 s 	 	little	 a 	 s 	 	they	like	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	often	what	you	get	.	right	?
the	math	 be 	 hind 	 	the	power	-	law	 distribut 	 ion 	 	is	that	 what 	 ever 	 	's	in	the	nth	position	is	 do 	 ing 	 	about	one	-	nth	of	 what 	 ever 	 	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	,	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	the	person	in	the	first	position	.
so	,	we	'd	expect	the	tenth	most	 pro 	 l 	 ific 	 	 photograph 	 er 	 	to	have	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	about	a	tenth	of	the	 photo 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 hundred 	 th 	 	most	 pro 	 l 	 ific 	 	 photograph 	 er 	 	to	have	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	about	a	hundred	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 pro 	 l 	 ific 	 	 photograph 	 er 	 	did	.
so	,	the	head	of	the	 curv 	 e 	 	can	be	 sharp 	 er 	 	or	flatter	.
but	that	 bas 	 ic 	 	math	 account 	 s 	 	both	for	the	steep	 slop 	 e 	 	and	for	the	long	,	flat	tail	.
and	 cur 	 iously 	 	,	in	these	 system 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	grow	 large 	 r 	 	,	the	 system 	 s 	 	do	n't	 converg 	 e 	 	;	they	diverge	more	.
in	 big 	 ger 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	the	head	 get 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	and	the	tail	 get 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	,	so	the	 im 	 balance 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	the	 curv 	 e 	 	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	left	-	 weight 	 ed 	 	.	here	's	how	 heav 	 ily 	 	:	if	you	take	the	top	10	percent	of	 photograph 	 ers 	 	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	they	account	for	three	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	the	 photo 	 s 	 	taken	--	just	the	top	10	percent	most	 pro 	 l 	 ific 	 	 photograph 	 ers 	 	.
if	you	go	down	to	five	percent	,	you	're	still	 account 	 ing 	 	for	60	percent	of	the	 photo 	 s 	 	.
if	you	go	down	to	one	percent	,	exclude	99	percent	of	the	group	effort	,	you	're	still	 account 	 ing 	 	for	 al 	 most 	 	a	quarter	of	the	 photo 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	left	 weight 	 ing 	 	,	the	average	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	here	,	way	to	the	left	.
and	that	 sound 	 s 	 	strange	to	our	 ear 	 s 	 	,	but	what	 end 	 s 	 	up	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	80	percent	of	the	 contributor 	 s 	 	have	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	a	 be 	 low 	 	-	average	amount	.
that	 sound 	 s 	 	strange	 be 	 cause 	 	we	expect	average	and	middle	to	be	about	the	same	,	but	they	're	not	at	all	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	math	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	the	80/20	rule	.	right	?
 when 	 ever 	 	you	hear	 any 	 body 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	80/20	rule	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	going	on	.	right	?
20	percent	of	the	 merchan 	 dis 	 e 	 	 account 	 s 	 	for	80	percent	of	the	revenue	,	20	percent	of	the	 user 	 s 	 	use	80	percent	of	the	 resource 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	shape	people	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	.
 institution 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	have	two	 tool 	 s 	 	:	 carrot 	 s 	 	and	 stick 	 s 	 	.
and	the	80	percent	zone	is	a	no	-	carrot	and	no	-	stick	zone	.
the	 cost 	 s 	 	of	running	the	institution	mean	that	you	can	not	take	on	the	work	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 eas 	 ily 	 	in	an	 institution 	 al 	 	frame	.
the	 institution 	 al 	 	model	 al 	 ways 	 	 push 	 es 	 	 left 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	 treat 	 ing 	 	these	people	 a 	 s 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	.
the	 institution 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	is	,	i	can	get	75	percent	of	the	value	for	10	percent	of	the	 hire 	 s 	 	--	great	,	that	's	what	i	'll	do	.
the	 co 	 operative 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	model	 say 	 s 	 	,	why	do	you	want	to	give	up	a	quarter	of	the	value	?
if	your	system	is	designed	so	that	you	have	to	give	up	a	quarter	of	the	value	,	re	-	engineer	the	system	.
do	n't	take	on	the	cost	that	 prevent 	 s 	 	you	from	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	of	these	people	.
build	the	system	so	that	 any 	 body 	 	can	 con 	 tribute 	 	at	any	amount	.
so	the	 coordi 	 nation 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	not	,	how	are	these	people	 a 	 s 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	what	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	like	?	right	?
we	have	over	here	psycho	milt	,	a	flickr	user	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	one	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	one	,	photo	titled	``	 ir 	 aq 	 	.	``
and	here	's	the	photo	.	right	.	 label 	 ed 	 	,	``	bad	day	at	work	.	``
right	?	so	the	question	is	,	do	you	want	that	photo	?	 y 	 es 	 	or	no	.
the	question	is	not	,	is	psycho	milt	a	good	 employ 	 ee 	 	?
and	the	tension	here	is	between	institution	 a 	 s 	 	 enabl 	 er 	 	and	institution	 a 	 s 	 	obstacle	.
when	you	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	left	-	hand	edge	of	one	of	these	 distribut 	 ions 	 	,	when	you	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	people	who	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	producing	a	lot	of	the	material	you	want	,	that	's	an	institution	-	 a 	 s 	 	-	 enabl 	 er 	 	world	.
you	can	hire	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	you	can	coordinate	 the 	 ir 	 	work	and	you	can	get	some	 out 	 put 	 	.
but	when	you	're	down	here	,	where	the	psycho	milts	of	the	world	are	 add 	 ing 	 	one	photo	at	a	time	,	that	's	institution	 a 	 s 	 	obstacle	.
 institution 	 s 	 	hate	 be 	 ing 	 	told	they	're	 obstacle 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	 institution 	 al 	 ize 	 	a	problem	is	that	the	first	goal	of	the	institution	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 shift 	 s 	 	from	 what 	 ever 	 	the	 nomi 	 nal 	 	goal	was	to	self	-	 p 	 reservation 	 	.
and	the	actual	goal	of	the	institution	 go 	 es 	 	to	two	through	n	.
right	?	so	,	when	 institution 	 s 	 	are	told	they	are	 obstacle 	 s 	 	,	and	that	there	are	other	ways	of	 coordi 	 nating 	 	the	value	,	they	go	through	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	bit	like	the	kubler	-	ross	 stage 	 s 	 	--	--	of	 re 	 action 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	told	you	have	a	fatal	 ill 	 ness 	 	:	 deni 	 al 	 	,	anger	,	 bar 	 gain 	 ing 	 	,	 accept 	 ance 	 	.

there	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	small	 ex 	 ample 	 	going	on	right	now	.
in	france	,	a	bus	company	is	suing	people	for	 form 	 ing 	 	a	 car 	 pool 	 	,	right	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	fact	that	they	have	 coordinate 	 d 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	create	 co 	 operative 	 	value	is	 depriv 	 ing 	 	them	of	revenue	.
you	can	follow	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 entertain 	 ing 	 	.
the	 big 	 ger 	 	question	is	,	what	do	you	do	about	the	value	down	here	?
right	?	how	do	you	capture	that	?
and	 institution 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	,	are	 prevent 	 ed 	 	from	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	that	.
steve	ballmer	,	now	ceo	of	 micro 	 soft 	 	,	was	 critic 	 izing 	 	linux	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	business	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 programm 	 ers 	 	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	linux	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	myth	.
we	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	who	's	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	linux	,	and	most	of	the	 patch 	 es 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 programm 	 ers 	 	who	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	one	thing	.	``	right	?
you	can	hear	 th 	 is 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	under	that	 complain 	 t 	 	.
and	you	can	see	why	,	from	ballmer	's	point	of	view	,	that	's	a	bad	idea	,	right	?
we	 hire 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 programm 	 er 	 	,	he	came	in	,	he	 d 	 rank 	 	our	cokes	and	 play 	 ed 	 	foosball	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	and	he	had	one	idea	.
right	?	bad	hire	.	right	?
the	psycho	milt	question	is	,	was	it	a	good	idea	?
what	if	it	was	a	security	patch	?
what	if	it	was	a	security	patch	for	a	 buff 	 er 	 	 over 	 flow 	 	exploit	,	of	which	 window 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	some	,	[	but	]	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	?
do	you	want	that	patch	,	right	?
the	fact	that	a	single	 programm 	 er 	 	can	,	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	move	 in 	 to 	 	a	professional	relation	to	an	institution	,	improve	linux	once	and	never	be	 s 	 een 	 	from	 aga 	 in 	 	,	should	terrify	ballmer	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	value	is	 un 	 reach 	 able 	 	in	classic	 institution 	 al 	 	 frame 	 work 	 s 	 	,	but	is	part	of	 co 	 operative 	 	 system 	 s 	 	of	open	-	source	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	of	file	sharing	,	of	the	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.	i	've	used	a	lot	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	from	flickr	,	but	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	from	all	over	.

so	they	're	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	it	,	using	these	 tool 	 s 	 	.
meetup	is	the	platform	,	but	the	value	here	is	in	social	 infra 	 structure 	 	.

and	i	use	that	word	 advise 	 d 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	a	revolution	in	that	it	's	a	change	in	equilibrium	.
it	's	a	whole	new	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	 include 	 s 	 	new	 down 	 side 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	right	now	,	a	woman	named	judith	miller	is	in	jail	for	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	 give 	 n 	 	to	a	federal	grand	jury	her	 source 	 s 	 	--	she	's	a	 report 	 er 	 	for	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	--	her	 source 	 s 	 	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	abstract	and	hard	-	to	-	follow	case	.
and	 journalist 	 s 	 	are	in	the	street	 r 	 ally 	 ing 	 	to	improve	the	shield	 law 	 s 	 	.
the	shield	 law 	 s 	 	are	our	 law 	 s 	 	--	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	a	 patch 	 work 	 	of	state	 law 	 s 	 	--	that	prevent	a	journalist	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	betray	a	source	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	against	the	 back 	 ground 	 	of	the	rise	of	web	logging	.
web	logging	is	a	classic	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	mass	 amateur 	 ization 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	de	-	 professional 	 ized 	 	 publish 	 ing 	 	.
want	to	publish	 global 	 ly 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	you	think	 to 	 day 	 	?
it	is	a	one	-	button	operation	that	you	can	do	for	free	.
that	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	the	professional	class	of	 publish 	 ing 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 rank 	 s 	 	of	mass	 amateur 	 ization 	 	.
and	so	the	shield	law	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	want	it	--	we	want	a	professional	class	of	truth	-	 teller 	 s 	 	--	it	is	 be 	 coming 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 in 	 cohere 	 nt 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	institution	is	 be 	 coming 	 	 in 	 cohere 	 nt 	 	.
there	are	people	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	right	now	 ty 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 knot 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	 blogger 	 s 	 	are	 journalist 	 s 	 	.
and	the	answer	to	that	question	is	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	not	the	right	question	.
 journal 	 ism 	 	was	an	answer	to	an	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	question	,	which	is	,	how	will	 socie 	 ty 	 	be	 inform 	 ed 	 	?
how	will	they	share	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 opinion 	 s 	 	?
and	if	there	is	an	answer	to	that	that	 happen 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	professional	 frame 	 work 	 	of	 journal 	 ism 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	no	sense	to	take	a	professional	metaphor	and	 app 	 ly 	 	it	to	 th 	 is 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	class	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	want	the	shield	 law 	 s 	 	,	the	 back 	 ground 	 	--	the	institution	to	which	they	 we 	 re 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	--	is	 be 	 coming 	 	 in 	 cohere 	 nt 	 	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
pro	-	ana	,	the	pro	-	ana	 group 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 group 	 s 	 	of	 teen 	 age 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	who	have	taken	on	web	 log 	 s 	 	,	 bullet 	 in 	 	 board 	 s 	 	,	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 co 	 operative 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	and	have	used	it	to	set	up	support	 group 	 s 	 	for	 remain 	 ing 	 	 ano 	 re 	 xic 	 	by	choice	.
they	post	 picture 	 s 	 	of	thin	 model 	 s 	 	,	which	they	call	``	 th 	 inspiration 	 	.	``
they	have	little	 slogan 	 s 	 	,	like	``	 salv 	 ation 	 	through	 starv 	 ation 	 	.	``
they	even	have	lance	armstrong	-	style	 brace 	 lets 	 	,	these	red	 brace 	 lets 	 	,	which	 sign 	 ify 	 	,	in	the	small	group	,	i	am	 try 	 ing 	 	to	maintain	my	eating	 dis 	 order 	 	.
they	trade	 tip 	 s 	 	,	like	,	if	you	feel	like	eating	 some 	 thing 	 	,	clean	a	toilet	or	the	litter	box	.	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	will	pass	.
we	're	used	to	support	 group 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	.
we	have	an	attitude	that	support	 group 	 s 	 	are	 inherent 	 ly 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	logic	of	the	support	group	is	value	neutral	.
a	support	group	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	small	group	that	 want 	 s 	 	to	maintain	a	way	of	living	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	a	 large 	 r 	 	group	.
now	,	when	the	 large 	 r 	 	group	is	a	bunch	of	 drunk 	 s 	 	,	and	the	small	group	 want 	 s 	 	to	stay	sober	,	then	we	think	,	that	's	a	great	support	group	.
but	when	the	small	group	is	 teen 	 age 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	who	want	to	stay	 ano 	 re 	 xic 	 	by	choice	,	then	we	're	 horr 	 ified 	 	.
what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	that	the	 norm 	 ative 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	of	the	support	 group 	 s 	 	that	we	're	used	to	,	came	from	the	 institution 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	framing	them	,	and	not	from	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
once	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 generic 	 ally 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	the	logic	of	the	support	group	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	to	be	 access 	 ible 	 	to	 any 	 one 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	people	 pur 	 suing 	 	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 goal 	 s 	 	.
so	,	there	are	significant	 down 	 side 	 s 	 	to	these	 change 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 up 	 side 	 s 	 	.	and	of	course	,	in	the	current	environment	,	one	need	 al 	 lude 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 light 	 ly 	 	to	the	work	of	non	-	state	 act 	 ors 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	influence	global	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	,	and	taking	advantage	of	these	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	social	map	of	the	 hijack 	 ers 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 associate 	 s 	 	who	 perpet 	 rated 	 	the	9/11	attack	.
it	was	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 analyz 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	using	a	lot	of	these	 tool 	 s 	 	.	and	 doubt 	 less 	 	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	the	world	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	work	 to 	 day 	 	for	the	 attack 	 s 	 	of	last	week	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	part	of	the	talk	where	i	tell	you	what	's	going	to	come	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	i	'm	running	out	of	time	,	which	is	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	know	.
right	.	 a 	 s 	 	with	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	if	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	revolution	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	us	from	point	a	to	point	b	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	us	from	point	a	to	 cha 	 os 	 	.
the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	 precipit 	 ated 	 	200	 year 	 s 	 	of	 cha 	 os 	 	,	moving	from	a	world	where	the	catholic	church	was	the	sort	of	 organ 	 izing 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	force	to	the	 treat 	 y 	 	of	westphalia	,	when	we	 final 	 ly 	 	 k 	 new 	 	what	the	new	unit	was	:	the	nation	state	.
now	,	i	'm	not	 predict 	 ing 	 	200	 year 	 s 	 	of	 cha 	 os 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	.	50	.
50	 year 	 s 	 	in	which	 loose 	 ly 	 	 coordinate 	 d 	 	 group 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	 give 	 n 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	high	leverage	,	and	the	more	 t 	 hose 	 	 group 	 s 	 	 fore 	 go 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	 institution 	 al 	 	 imper 	 ative 	 s 	 	--	like	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	in	advance	what	's	going	to	happen	,	or	the	profit	motive	--	the	more	leverage	they	'll	get	.
and	 institution 	 s 	 	are	going	to	come	under	an	increasing	degree	of	pressure	,	and	the	more	 rigid 	 ly 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	,	and	the	more	they	 re 	 ly 	 	on	information	 monopol 	 ies 	 	,	the	 great 	 er 	 	the	pressure	is	going	to	be	.
and	that	's	going	to	happen	one	arena	at	a	time	,	one	institution	at	a	time	.	the	 force 	 s 	 	are	general	,	but	the	 result 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	specific	.
and	so	the	point	here	is	not	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	``	or	``	we	're	going	to	see	a	 transit 	 ion 	 	from	 on 	 ly 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	to	 on 	 ly 	 	 co 	 operative 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	.	``
it	's	going	to	be	much	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	that	.
but	the	point	is	that	it	's	going	to	be	a	massive	 re 	 adjust 	 ment 	 	.
and	since	we	can	see	it	in	advance	and	know	it	's	coming	,	my	argument	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	:	we	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	get	good	at	it	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
