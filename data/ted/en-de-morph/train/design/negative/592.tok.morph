i	 normal 	 ly 	 	teach	 course 	 s 	 	on	how	to	 re 	 build 	 	 state 	 s 	 	after	war	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	i	've	got	a	personal	story	to	share	with	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	my	family	,	my	four	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	--	my	mom	and	i	--	taken	in	1977	.
and	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	cambodians	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	taken	in	vietnam	.
so	how	did	a	cambodian	family	end	up	in	vietnam	in	1977	?
well	to	explain	that	,	i	've	got	a	short	video	clip	to	explain	the	khmer	rouge	regime	 dur 	 ing 	 	1975	and	1979	.
video	:	april	17th	,	1975	.
the	 commun 	 ist 	 	khmer	rouge	 enter 	 s 	 	phnom	penh	to	liberate	 the 	 ir 	 	people	from	the	 encroach 	 ing 	 	conflict	in	vietnam	,	and	american	 bomb 	 ing 	 	 campaign 	 s 	 	.
led	by	peasant	-	born	pol	pot	,	the	khmer	rouge	 evacuate 	 s 	 	people	to	the	 country 	 side 	 	in	order	to	create	a	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ist 	 	utopia	,	much	like	mao	tse	-	tung	's	cultural	revolution	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
the	khmer	rouge	 close 	 s 	 	the	 door 	 s 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	.
but	after	four	 year 	 s 	 	the	grim	truth	 seep 	 s 	 	out	.
in	a	country	of	 on 	 ly 	 	seven	million	people	,	one	and	a	half	million	 we 	 re 	 	 murder 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 pil 	 ed 	 	in	the	mass	 grave 	 s 	 	of	the	 kill 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	.
sophal	ear	:	so	,	 not 	 with 	 stand 	 ing 	 	the	1970s	 nar 	 ration 	 	,	on	april	17th	1975	we	lived	in	phnom	penh	.
and	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	told	by	the	khmer	rouge	to	evacuate	the	city	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 imp 	 end 	 ing 	 	american	 bomb 	 ing 	 	for	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	here	is	a	picture	of	the	khmer	rouge	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	young	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	 typical 	 ly 	 	child	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	normal	now	,	of	modern	day	conflict	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	easy	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 war 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	that	they	 g 	 ave 	 	about	american	 bomb 	 ing 	 	was	n't	all	that	far	off	.
i	mean	,	from	1965	to	1973	there	 we 	 re 	 	more	 mun 	 ition 	 s 	 	that	fell	on	cambodia	than	in	all	of	world	war	ii	japan	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	two	nuclear	 bomb 	 s 	 	of	august	1945	.
the	khmer	rouge	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	money	.
so	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	federal	 re 	 serve 	 	bank	in	cambodia	was	 bomb 	 ed 	 	.
but	not	just	that	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 bann 	 ed 	 	money	.
i	think	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 precede 	 nt 	 	in	which	money	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	used	.
and	we	know	money	is	the	root	of	all	 e 	 vil 	 	,	but	it	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	stop	 e 	 vil 	 	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	cambodia	,	in	fact	.
my	family	was	 move 	 d 	 	from	phnom	penh	to	pursat	 pro 	 vince 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	what	pursat	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	area	of	cambodia	,	where	rice	growing	 take 	 s 	 	place	.
and	in	fact	they	 we 	 re 	 	 force 	 d 	 	to	work	the	 field 	 s 	 	.
so	my	father	and	mother	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	a	sort	of	 concent 	 ration 	 	camp	,	labor	camp	.
and	it	was	at	that	time	that	my	mother	got	word	from	the	 commun 	 e 	 	chief	that	the	vietnamese	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	to	go	back	to	vietnam	.
and	she	spoke	some	vietnamese	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	 hav 	 ing 	 	grown	up	with	vietnamese	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	she	 decide 	 d 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	 ad 	 vice 	 	of	her	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	that	she	would	take	the	chance	and	claim	to	be	vietnamese	so	that	we	could	have	a	chance	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	they	're	forcing	 every 	 body 	 	to	work	.
and	they	're	giving	about	--	in	a	modern	-	day	,	caloric	-	 restrict 	 ion 	 	diet	,	i	guess	--	they	're	giving	 por 	 ridge 	 	,	with	a	few	 grain 	 s 	 	of	rice	.
and	at	about	 th 	 is 	 	time	 actual 	 ly 	 	my	father	got	 ver 	 y 	 	sick	.
and	he	did	n't	speak	vietnamese	.
so	he	 di 	 ed 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	january	1976	.
and	it	made	it	possible	,	in	fact	,	for	us	to	take	on	 th 	 is 	 	plan	.
so	the	khmer	rouge	took	us	from	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	pursat	to	kaoh	tiev	,	which	is	 a 	 cross 	 	from	the	border	from	vietnam	.
and	there	they	had	a	 de 	 tent 	 ion 	 	camp	where	 alle 	 ged 	 	vietnamese	would	be	tested	,	language	tested	.
and	my	mother	's	vietnamese	was	so	bad	that	to	make	our	story	more	credible	,	she	'd	 give 	 n 	 	all	the	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	new	vietnamese	 name 	 s 	 	.
but	she	'd	 give 	 n 	 	the	 boy 	 s 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	'	 name 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	'	 name 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	she	met	a	vietnamese	 lad 	 y 	 	who	told	her	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	then	 tutor 	 ed 	 	her	for	two	 day 	 s 	 	 intensive 	 ly 	 	,	that	she	was	able	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	her	 ex 	 am 	 	and	--	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	moment	of	truth	.
if	she	 fail 	 s 	 	,	we	're	all	headed	to	the	 gal 	 low 	 s 	 	;	if	she	 pass 	 es 	 	,	we	can	 leav 	 e 	 	to	vietnam	.
and	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	of	course	--	i	'm	here	,	she	 pass 	 es 	 	.
and	we	end	up	in	hong	ngu	on	the	vietnamese	side	.
and	then	 on 	 ward 	 s 	 	to	chau	doc	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	hong	ngu	,	vietnam	 to 	 day 	 	.
a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 idy 	 llic 	 	place	on	the	mekong	 del 	 ta 	 	.
but	for	us	it	 me 	 ant 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	.
and	 free 	 dom 	 	from	 per 	 sec 	 ution 	 	from	the	khmer	rouge	.
last	year	,	the	khmer	rouge	 trib 	 un 	 al 	 	,	which	the	u.n.	is	 help 	 ing 	 	cambodia	take	on	,	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	record	i	should	file	a	civil	 complain 	 t 	 	with	the	 trib 	 un 	 al 	 	about	my	father	's	 pass 	 ing 	 	away	.
and	i	got	word	last	month	that	the	 complain 	 t 	 	was	 official 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	by	the	khmer	rouge	 trib 	 un 	 al 	 	.
and	it	's	for	me	a	matter	of	justice	for	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	 account 	 ability 	 	for	the	future	,	 be 	 cause 	 	cambodia	 remain 	 s 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 law 	 less 	 	place	,	at	 time 	 s 	 	.
five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	my	mother	and	i	went	back	to	chau	doc	.
and	she	was	able	to	return	to	a	place	that	for	her	 me 	 ant 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	fear	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	just	come	out	of	cambodia	.
i	'm	happy	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	to	present	her	.
she	's	here	 to 	 day 	 	with	us	in	the	audience	.
thank	you	mother	.
