what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	are	the	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	that	create	the	living	fabric	of	your	body	.
now	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
and	by	 tin 	 y 	 	,	i	mean	 re 	 ally 	 	.
they	're	 small 	 er 	 	than	a	 wave 	 length 	 	of	light	,	so	we	have	no	way	to	 direct 	 ly 	 	 observ 	 e 	 	them	.
but	through	science	,	we	do	have	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	good	idea	of	what	's	going	on	down	at	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	scale	.
so	what	we	can	do	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	tell	you	about	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	direct	way	of	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
one	way	around	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	draw	 picture 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	idea	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	new	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 create 	 d 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 discover 	 y 	 	process	.
they	draw	 picture 	 s 	 	of	what	they	're	 observ 	 ing 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	through	technology	like	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	and	 micro 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	what	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	.
i	 pick 	 ed 	 	two	well	-	known	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	known	for	 express 	 ing 	 	science	through	art	.
and	i	start	with	galileo	who	used	the	world	's	first	 tele 	 scope 	 	to	look	at	the	moon	.
and	he	 transform 	 ed 	 	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	moon	.
the	 per 	 ception 	 	in	the	17th	century	was	the	moon	was	a	perfect	 heaven 	 ly 	 	sphere	.
but	what	galileo	saw	was	a	 rock 	 y 	 	,	 bar 	 ren 	 	world	,	which	he	 express 	 ed 	 	through	his	 water 	 color 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	scientist	with	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 idea 	 s 	 	,	the	 super 	 star 	 	of	biology	,	is	charles	darwin	.
and	with	 th 	 is 	 	famous	entry	in	his	 note 	 book 	 	,	he	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	top	left	-	hand	corner	with	,	``	i	think	,	``	and	then	 sketch 	 es 	 	out	the	first	tree	of	life	,	which	is	his	 per 	 ception 	 	of	how	all	the	species	,	all	living	 thing 	 s 	 	on	earth	,	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	through	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	--	the	origin	of	species	through	natural	 s 	 election 	 	and	 diverge 	 nce 	 	from	an	 ance 	 stral 	 	population	.
even	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	i	used	to	go	to	 lectur 	 es 	 	by	 mole 	 cular 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	and	find	them	 complete 	 ly 	 	 in 	 comprehens 	 ible 	 	,	with	all	the	 f 	 ancy 	 	technical	language	and	 jar 	 gon 	 	that	they	would	use	in	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	work	,	 un 	 til 	 	i	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	the	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	of	david	goodsell	,	who	is	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biologist	at	the	scripps	institute	.
and	his	 picture 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	's	accurate	and	it	's	all	to	scale	.
and	his	work	 illuminate 	 d 	 	for	me	what	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	world	 in 	 side 	 	us	is	like	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	transection	through	blood	.
in	the	top	left	-	hand	corner	,	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	yellow	-	green	area	.
the	yellow	-	green	area	is	the	 fluid 	 s 	 	of	blood	,	which	is	 most 	 ly 	 	water	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 anti 	 bodies 	 	,	 sugar 	 s 	 	,	 hormone 	 s 	 	,	that	kind	of	thing	.
and	the	red	region	is	a	slice	 in 	 to 	 	a	red	blood	cell	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	red	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	hemoglobin	.
they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	red	;	that	's	what	 give 	 s 	 	blood	 it 	 s 	 	color	.
and	hemoglobin	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	sponge	to	soak	up	the	oxygen	in	your	 lung 	 s 	 	and	then	carry	it	to	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	body	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	inspired	by	 th 	 is 	 	image	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	we	could	use	computer	 graphic 	 s 	 	to	represent	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	world	.
what	would	it	look	like	?
and	that	's	how	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	.	so	let	's	begin	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	dna	in	 it 	 s 	 	classic	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	form	.
and	it	's	from	x	-	ray	 crystall 	 ography 	 	,	so	it	's	an	accurate	model	of	dna	.
if	we	 un 	 wind 	 	the	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	and	unzip	the	two	 strand 	 s 	 	,	you	see	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 tee 	 th 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 letter 	 s 	 	of	genetic	code	,	the	25,000	 gene 	 s 	 	you	've	got	written	in	your	dna	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	 typical 	 ly 	 	talk	about	--	the	genetic	code	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
but	i	want	to	talk	about	a	different	 a 	 spect 	 	of	dna	science	,	and	that	is	the	physical	nature	of	dna	.
it	's	these	two	 strand 	 s 	 	that	run	in	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	for	 reason 	 s 	 	i	ca	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	right	now	.
but	they	 physical 	 ly 	 	run	in	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	,	which	 create 	 s 	 	a	number	of	 complic 	 ations 	 	for	your	living	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	about	to	see	,	most	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	when	dna	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 cop 	 ied 	 	.
and	so	what	i	'm	about	to	show	you	is	an	accurate	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	the	actual	dna	 replica 	 tion 	 	machine	that	's	 occur 	 ring 	 	right	now	 in 	 side 	 	your	body	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	2002	biology	.
so	dna	's	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	production	line	from	the	left	-	hand	side	,	and	it	 hit 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	,	these	 miniatur 	 e 	 	 bio 	 chemical 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 pull 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	the	dna	strand	and	making	an	exact	copy	.
so	dna	 come 	 s 	 	in	and	 hit 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	blue	,	 dough 	 nut 	 	-	shaped	structure	and	it	's	 rip 	 ped 	 	 a 	 part 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	two	 strand 	 s 	 	.
one	strand	can	be	 cop 	 ied 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	and	you	can	see	these	 thing 	 s 	 	spooling	off	to	the	bottom	there	.
but	 thing 	 s 	 	are	n't	so	simple	for	the	other	strand	 be 	 cause 	 	it	must	be	 cop 	 ied 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	 throw 	 n 	 	out	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	in	these	 loop 	 s 	 	and	 cop 	 ied 	 	one	section	at	a	time	,	creating	two	new	dna	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
now	you	have	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	machine	right	now	 work 	 ing 	 	away	 in 	 side 	 	you	,	 copy 	 ing 	 	your	dna	with	exquisite	fidelity	.
it	's	an	accurate	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	and	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	at	the	correct	speed	for	what	is	 occur 	 ring 	 	 in 	 side 	 	you	.
i	've	left	out	error	 correct 	 ion 	 	and	a	bunch	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	work	from	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
thank	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	work	from	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	but	what	i	'll	show	you	next	is	 update 	 d 	 	science	,	it	's	 update 	 d 	 	technology	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	begin	with	dna	.
and	it	's	jiggling	and	 wig 	 gling 	 	there	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	soup	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	which	i	've	 strip 	 ped 	 	away	so	you	can	see	 some 	 thing 	 	.
dna	is	about	two	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
but	in	each	one	of	your	 cell 	 s 	 	,	each	strand	of	dna	is	about	30	to	40	million	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	long	.
so	to	keep	the	dna	 organize 	 d 	 	and	 regulat 	 e 	 	access	to	the	genetic	code	,	it	's	 wrap 	 ped 	 	around	these	 pur 	 ple 	 	 protein 	 s 	 	--	or	i	've	 label 	 ed 	 	them	 pur 	 ple 	 	here	.
it	's	 package 	 d 	 	up	and	bundled	up	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	field	of	view	is	a	single	strand	of	dna	.
 th 	 is 	 	huge	package	of	dna	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
and	we	'll	come	back	to	 chromosom 	 es 	 	in	a	minute	.
we	're	 pull 	 ing 	 	out	,	we	're	 zoom 	 ing 	 	out	,	out	through	a	nuclear	pore	,	which	is	the	 gate 	 way 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	compartment	that	 hold 	 s 	 	all	the	dna	 call 	 ed 	 	the	nucleus	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	field	of	view	is	about	a	semester	's	worth	of	biology	,	and	i	've	got	seven	 minute 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	do	that	 to 	 day 	 	?
no	,	i	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	told	,	``	no.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	a	living	cell	 look 	 s 	 	down	a	light	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	under	time	-	lapse	,	which	is	why	you	can	see	it	moving	.
the	nuclear	 envelop 	 e 	 	 break 	 s 	 	down	.
these	sausage	-	shaped	 thing 	 s 	 	are	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	,	and	we	'll	focus	on	them	.
they	go	through	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	motion	that	is	focused	on	these	little	red	 spot 	 s 	 	.
when	the	cell	 feel 	 s 	 	it	's	ready	to	go	,	it	 rip 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	the	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
one	set	of	dna	 go 	 es 	 	to	one	side	,	the	other	side	 get 	 s 	 	the	other	set	of	dna	--	 ident 	 ical 	 	copies	of	dna	.
and	then	the	cell	 split 	 s 	 	down	the	middle	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	have	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	 under 	 going 	 	 th 	 is 	 	process	right	now	 in 	 side 	 	of	you	.
now	we	're	going	to	rewind	and	just	focus	on	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	and	look	at	 it 	 s 	 	structure	and	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	here	we	are	at	that	 equ 	 ator 	 	moment	.
the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	line	up	.
and	if	we	isolate	just	one	 chromosom 	 e 	 	,	we	're	going	to	pull	it	out	and	have	a	look	at	 it 	 s 	 	structure	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	that	you	have	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	so	far	 in 	 side 	 	of	us	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	single	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
and	you	have	two	 strand 	 s 	 	of	dna	in	each	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
one	is	bundled	up	 in 	 to 	 	one	sausage	.
the	other	strand	is	bundled	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	other	sausage	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 whisk 	 ers 	 	that	are	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	from	either	side	are	the	dynamic	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	of	the	cell	.
they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	mircrotubules	.	that	name	's	not	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	what	we	're	going	to	focus	on	is	 th 	 is 	 	red	region	--	i	've	 label 	 ed 	 	it	red	here	--	and	it	's	the	 inter 	 face 	 	between	the	dynamic	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	and	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
it	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	central	to	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
we	have	no	idea	 re 	 ally 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	it	's	 achiev 	 ing 	 	that	 move 	 ment 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	they	call	the	kinetochore	for	over	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	with	 intens 	 e 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	we	're	still	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	discover	what	it	's	all	about	.
it	is	made	up	of	about	200	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 protein 	 s 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 protein 	 s 	 	in	total	.
it	is	a	signal	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	system	.
it	broadcasts	through	chemical	 signal 	 s 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	rest	of	the	cell	when	it	's	ready	,	when	it	 feel 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 align 	 ed 	 	and	ready	to	go	for	the	 separat 	 ion 	 	of	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
it	is	able	to	couple	onto	the	growing	and	 shrink 	 ing 	 	microtubules	.
it	's	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	growing	of	the	microtubules	,	and	it	's	able	to	transiently	couple	onto	them	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	attention	 sens 	 ing 	 	system	.
it	's	able	to	feel	when	the	cell	is	ready	,	when	the	 chromosom 	 e 	 	is	 correct 	 ly 	 	 position 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 turn 	 ing 	 	green	here	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 feel 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	is	just	right	.
and	you	'll	see	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	one	little	last	bit	that	's	still	 remain 	 ing 	 	red	.
and	it	's	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	down	the	microtubules	.
that	is	the	signal	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	system	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	out	the	stop	signal	.
and	it	's	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	.	i	mean	,	it	's	that	 mechanic 	 al 	 	.
it	's	 mole 	 cular 	 	 clock 	 work 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	work	at	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	scale	.
so	with	a	little	bit	of	 mole 	 cular 	 	eye	 can 	 dy 	 	,	we	've	got	 kine 	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	,	which	are	the	 o 	 range 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
they	're	little	 mole 	 cular 	 	 cou 	 rier 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	one	way	.
and	here	are	the	dynein	.	they	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	that	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	system	.
and	they	've	got	 the 	 ir 	 	long	 leg 	 s 	 	so	they	can	step	around	 obstacle 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	derived	 accurate 	 ly 	 	from	the	science	.
the	problem	is	we	ca	n't	show	it	to	you	any	other	way	.
 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	at	the	 front 	 ier 	 	of	science	,	at	the	 front 	 ier 	 	of	human	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	is	mind	-	 blow 	 ing 	 	.
 discover 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	a	 pleas 	 ur 	 able 	 	incentive	to	work	in	science	.
but	most	medical	 research 	 ers 	 	--	 discover 	 ing 	 	the	stuff	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	 step 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	path	to	the	big	 goal 	 s 	 	,	which	are	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	disease	,	to	eliminate	the	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	the	 mis 	 ery 	 	that	disease	 cause 	 s 	 	and	to	lift	people	out	of	poverty	.
thank	you	.
