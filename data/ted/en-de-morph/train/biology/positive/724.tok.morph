i	'd	like	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	the	human	brain	,	which	is	what	we	do	research	on	at	the	university	of	california	.
just	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	problem	for	a	second	.
here	is	a	lump	of	 fl 	 esh 	 	,	about	three	 pound 	 s 	 	,	which	you	can	hold	in	the	palm	of	your	hand	.
but	it	can	 contempl 	 ate 	 	the	 vast 	 ness 	 	of	 inter 	 stellar 	 	space	.
it	can	 contempl 	 ate 	 	the	meaning	of	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	,	ask	 question 	 s 	 	about	the	meaning	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	about	the	nature	of	god	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	in	the	world	.
it	's	the	 great 	 est 	 	 myster 	 y 	 	 confront 	 ing 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	:	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	come	about	?
well	,	the	brain	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	is	made	up	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
we	're	looking	at	 neuro 	 ns 	 	here	.
there	are	100	billion	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	the	adult	human	brain	.
and	each	 neuro 	 n 	 	 make 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	1,000	to	10,000	 contact 	 s 	 	with	other	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	the	brain	.
and	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	people	have	 calcul 	 ated 	 	that	the	number	of	 per 	 mutation 	 s 	 	and	 combination 	 s 	 	of	brain	activity	 exceed 	 s 	 	the	number	of	 element 	 ary 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	,	how	do	you	go	about	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	brain	?
one	approach	is	to	look	at	 patient 	 s 	 	who	had	 les 	 ions 	 	in	different	part	of	the	brain	,	and	 stud 	 y 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	spoke	about	in	the	last	ted	.
 to 	 day 	 	i	'll	talk	about	a	different	approach	,	which	is	to	put	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	in	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	record	the	activity	of	individual	nerve	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
sort	of	 eaves 	 drop 	 	on	the	activity	of	nerve	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
now	,	one	 re 	 cent 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	made	by	 research 	 ers 	 	in	italy	,	in	parma	,	by	giacomo	rizzolatti	and	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	is	a	group	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	mirror	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	which	are	on	the	front	of	the	brain	in	the	frontal	 lobe 	 s 	 	.
now	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	are	 neuro 	 ns 	 	which	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	motor	command	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	the	front	of	the	brain	,	which	have	 be 	 en 	 	known	for	over	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
these	 neuro 	 ns 	 	will	fire	when	a	person	 perform 	 s 	 	a	specific	action	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	i	do	that	,	and	reach	and	grab	an	apple	,	a	motor	command	 neuro 	 n 	 	in	the	front	of	my	brain	will	fire	.
if	i	reach	out	and	pull	an	object	,	 an 	 other 	 	 neuro 	 n 	 	will	fire	,	 command 	 ing 	 	me	to	pull	that	object	.
these	are	 call 	 ed 	 	motor	command	 neuro 	 ns 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	known	for	a	long	time	.
but	what	rizzolatti	found	was	a	 sub 	 set 	 	of	these	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	about	20	percent	of	them	,	will	 al 	 so 	 	fire	when	i	'm	looking	at	 some 	 body 	 	else	 perform 	 ing 	 	the	same	action	.
so	,	here	is	a	 neuro 	 n 	 	that	 fire 	 s 	 	when	i	reach	and	grab	 some 	 thing 	 	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	when	i	watch	joe	 reach 	 ing 	 	and	 grab 	 bing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 neuro 	 n 	 	is	 adopt 	 ing 	 	the	other	person	's	point	of	view	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 perform 	 ing 	 	a	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	 simul 	 ation 	 	of	the	other	person	's	action	.
now	,	what	is	the	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	of	these	mirror	 neuro 	 ns 	 	?
for	one	thing	they	must	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 imit 	 ation 	 	and	 emul 	 ation 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	to	 imit 	 ate 	 	a	complex	act	 requir 	 es 	 	my	brain	to	adopt	the	other	person	's	point	of	view	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 imit 	 ation 	 	and	 emul 	 ation 	 	.
well	,	why	is	that	 import 	 ant 	 	?
well	,	let	's	take	a	look	at	the	next	slide	.
so	,	how	do	you	do	 imit 	 ation 	 	?	why	is	 imit 	 ation 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
mirror	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	 imit 	 ation 	 	,	 emul 	 ation 	 	.
now	,	let	's	look	at	culture	,	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	human	culture	.
if	you	go	back	in	time	about	[	75,000	]	to	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	let	's	look	at	human	evolution	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	around	75,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	that	is	,	there	is	a	sudden	emergence	and	rapid	spread	of	a	number	of	 skill 	 s 	 	that	are	 un 	 ique 	 	to	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	like	tool	use	,	the	use	of	fire	,	the	use	of	 shelter 	 s 	 	,	and	,	of	course	,	language	,	and	the	ability	to	read	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	mind	and	interpret	that	person	's	behavior	.
all	of	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	human	brain	had	 achiev 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	present	 s 	 ize 	 	 al 	 most 	 	three	or	four	hundred	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	claim	that	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	the	sudden	emergence	of	a	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	mirror	 neuro 	 n 	 	system	,	which	 allow 	 ed 	 	you	to	 emul 	 ate 	 	and	 imit 	 ate 	 	other	people	's	 action 	 s 	 	.
so	that	when	there	was	a	sudden	 accident 	 al 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	by	one	member	of	the	group	,	say	the	use	of	fire	,	or	a	 part 	 icular 	 	type	of	tool	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 dy 	 ing 	 	out	,	 th 	 is 	 	spread	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	 horizon 	 t 	 ally 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	population	,	or	was	 transmit 	 ted 	 	 vert 	 ically 	 	,	down	the	 generation 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	made	evolution	 sudden 	 ly 	 	lamarckian	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	darwinian	.
darwinian	evolution	is	 s 	 low 	 	;	it	 take 	 s 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
a	polar	bear	,	to	evolve	a	coat	,	will	take	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 generation 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	a	child	,	can	just	watch	 it 	 s 	 	parent	kill	 an 	 other 	 	polar	bear	,	and	skin	it	and	put	the	skin	on	 it 	 s 	 	body	,	fur	on	the	body	,	and	learn	it	in	one	step	.	what	the	polar	bear	took	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	to	learn	,	it	can	learn	in	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	.
and	then	once	it	's	 learn 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	it	 spread 	 s 	 	in	 geo 	 metric 	 	proportion	 a 	 cross 	 	a	population	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 bas 	 is 	 	.	the	 imit 	 ation 	 	of	complex	 skill 	 s 	 	is	what	we	call	culture	and	is	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
now	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	mirror	 neuro 	 n 	 	,	which	is	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
and	that	is	,	there	are	mirror	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	mirror	 neuro 	 ns 	 	for	action	,	there	are	mirror	 neuro 	 ns 	 	for	touch	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	if	 some 	 body 	 	 touch 	 es 	 	me	,	my	hand	,	 neuro 	 n 	 	in	the	 som 	 ato 	 sensor 	 y 	 	cortex	in	the	 sensor 	 y 	 	region	of	the	brain	 fire 	 s 	 	.
but	the	same	 neuro 	 n 	 	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	will	fire	when	i	 simpl 	 y 	 	watch	 an 	 other 	 	person	 be 	 ing 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	it	's	 empath 	 izing 	 	the	other	person	 be 	 ing 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	most	of	them	will	fire	when	i	'm	 touch 	 ed 	 	in	different	 location 	 s 	 	.	different	 neuro 	 ns 	 	for	different	 location 	 s 	 	.
but	a	 sub 	 set 	 	of	them	will	fire	even	when	i	watch	 some 	 body 	 	else	 be 	 ing 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	in	the	same	location	.
so	,	here	 aga 	 in 	 	you	have	 neuro 	 ns 	 	which	are	 enroll 	 ed 	 	in	 empath 	 y 	 	.
now	,	the	question	then	 arise 	 s 	 	:	if	i	 simpl 	 y 	 	watch	 an 	 other 	 	person	 be 	 ing 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	,	why	do	i	not	get	 con 	 fused 	 	and	 liter 	 ally 	 	feel	that	touch	 sens 	 ation 	 	 mere 	 ly 	 	by	 watch 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	?
i	mean	,	i	 empath 	 ize 	 	with	that	person	but	i	do	n't	 liter 	 ally 	 	feel	the	touch	.
well	,	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	got	 receptor 	 s 	 	in	your	skin	,	touch	and	pain	 receptor 	 s 	 	,	going	back	 in 	 to 	 	your	brain	and	 say 	 ing 	 	``	do	n't	worry	,	you	're	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	 empath 	 ize 	 	,	by	all	 mean 	 s 	 	,	with	the	other	person	,	but	do	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	experience	the	touch	,	 other 	 wise 	 	you	'll	get	 con 	 fused 	 	and	 muddle 	 d 	 	.	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	there	is	a	 feed 	 back 	 	signal	that	 ve 	 to 	 es 	 	the	signal	of	the	mirror	 neuro 	 n 	 	 prevent 	 ing 	 	you	from	 conscious 	 ly 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	that	touch	.
but	if	you	 re 	 move 	 	the	arm	,	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	 anesthet 	 ize 	 	my	arm	,	so	you	put	an	 inject 	 ion 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	arm	,	 anesthet 	 ize 	 	the	brachial	 plex 	 us 	 	,	so	the	arm	is	numb	,	and	there	is	no	 sens 	 ations 	 	coming	in	,	if	i	now	watch	you	 be 	 ing 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	,	i	 liter 	 ally 	 	feel	it	in	my	hand	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	you	have	 dis 	 solve 	 d 	 	the	 bar 	 rier 	 	between	you	and	other	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	call	them	gandhi	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	or	 empath 	 y 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	in	some	abstract	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	sense	.
all	that	's	 separat 	 ing 	 	you	from	him	,	from	the	other	person	,	is	your	skin	.
 re 	 move 	 	the	skin	,	you	experience	that	person	's	touch	in	your	mind	.
you	've	 dis 	 solve 	 d 	 	the	 bar 	 rier 	 	between	you	and	other	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	is	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	much	of	eastern	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	and	that	is	there	is	no	real	 in 	 dependent 	 	self	,	 al 	 o 	 of 	 	from	other	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 inspect 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	 inspect 	 ing 	 	other	people	.
you	are	,	in	fact	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	not	just	via	facebook	and	 inter 	 net 	 	,	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	by	your	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
and	there	is	whole	 chain 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	around	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	.
and	there	is	no	real	 distinct 	 ive 	 ness 	 	of	your	 conscious 	 ness 	 	from	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	mumbo	-	jumbo	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
it	 emerge 	 s 	 	from	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	 neuro 	 science 	 	.
so	,	you	have	a	patient	with	a	phantom	limb	.	if	the	arm	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	and	you	have	a	phantom	,	and	you	watch	 some 	 body 	 	else	 be 	 ing 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	,	you	feel	it	in	your	phantom	.
now	the	 astonish 	 ing 	 	thing	is	,	if	you	have	pain	in	your	phantom	limb	,	you	 squeez 	 e 	 	the	other	person	's	hand	,	 mass 	 age 	 	the	other	person	's	hand	,	that	 reliev 	 es 	 	the	pain	in	your	phantom	hand	,	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 neuro 	 n 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 obtain 	 ing 	 	relief	from	 mere 	 ly 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	else	 be 	 ing 	 	 mass 	 aged 	 	.
so	,	here	you	have	my	last	slide	.
for	the	 long 	 est 	 	time	people	have	 regard 	 ed 	 	science	and	 human 	 ities 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	distinct	.
c.p	.	snow	spoke	of	the	two	 culture 	 s 	 	:	science	on	the	one	hand	,	 human 	 ities 	 	on	the	other	;	never	the	 tw 	 ain 	 	 s 	 hall 	 	meet	.
so	,	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	the	mirror	 neuro 	 n 	 	system	 under 	 lies 	 	the	 inter 	 face 	 	 allow 	 ing 	 	you	to	 re 	 think 	 	about	 issue 	 s 	 	like	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	self	,	what	 separat 	 es 	 	you	from	other	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	what	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	 empath 	 ize 	 	with	other	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	even	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	emergence	of	culture	and	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	which	is	 un 	 ique 	 	to	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	thank	you	.
