one	way	to	change	our	 gene 	 s 	 	is	to	make	new	 one 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	craig	venter	 ha 	 s 	 	so	 elegant 	 ly 	 	 show 	 n 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	is	to	change	our	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	how	 power 	 ful 	 	and	dynamic	these	 change 	 s 	 	can	be	,	that	you	do	n't	have	to	wait	 ver 	 y 	 	long	to	see	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
when	you	eat	 health 	 ier 	 	,	manage	stress	,	 exercis 	 e 	 	and	love	more	,	your	brain	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	more	blood	flow	and	more	oxygen	.
but	more	than	that	,	your	brain	 get 	 s 	 	 measur 	 ably 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	.
 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	thought	 im 	 possible 	 	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 measur 	 ed 	 	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	by	 rob 	 in 	 	williams	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	before	the	rest	of	us	.
now	,	there	's	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	can	do	to	make	your	brain	grow	new	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	.
some	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	chocolate	and	tea	,	 blue 	 berries 	 	,	alcohol	in	 mode 	 ration 	 	,	stress	management	and	 can 	 na 	 bi 	 noids 	 	found	in	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	.
i	'm	just	the	messenger	.
what	 we 	 re 	 	we	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?
and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	make	it	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	that	can	cause	you	to	lose	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	.
the	usual	 suspect 	 s 	 	,	like	 saturate 	 d 	 	fat	and	sugar	,	 nic 	 ot 	 ine 	 	,	 opi 	 ates 	 	,	 coca 	 ine 	 	,	too	much	alcohol	and	chronic	stress	.
your	skin	 get 	 s 	 	more	blood	flow	when	you	change	your	 life 	 style 	 	,	so	you	age	less	 quick 	 ly 	 	.	your	skin	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 wrinkl 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	.
your	heart	 get 	 s 	 	more	blood	flow	.
we	've	 show 	 n 	 	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	reverse	heart	disease	.
that	these	 clog 	 ged 	 	 arteri 	 es 	 	that	you	see	on	the	upper	left	,	after	 on 	 ly 	 	a	year	 be 	 come 	 	 measur 	 ably 	 	less	 clog 	 ged 	 	.
and	the	cardiac	pet	 s 	 can 	 	 show 	 n 	 	on	the	lower	left	,	the	blue	 mean 	 s 	 	no	blood	flow	.
a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	--	 o 	 range 	 	and	white	is	 maxim 	 um 	 	blood	flow	.
we	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	may	be	able	to	stop	and	reverse	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	early	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	and	,	by	 extens 	 ion 	 	,	breast	cancer	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	making	these	 change 	 s 	 	.
we	've	found	that	tumor	growth	in	vitro	was	 inhibit 	 ed 	 	70	percent	in	the	group	that	made	these	 change 	 s 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	nine	percent	in	the	 compar 	 ison 	 	group	.
these	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	significant	.
even	your	sexual	 organ 	 s 	 	get	more	blood	flow	,	so	you	 in 	 crease 	 	sexual	 pot 	 ency 	 	.
one	of	the	most	effective	anti	-	 smok 	 ing 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	health	 service 	 s 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	that	 nic 	 ot 	 ine 	 	,	which	 con 	 strict 	 s 	 	your	 arteri 	 es 	 	,	can	cause	a	heart	attack	or	a	stroke	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	 im 	 pot 	 ence 	 	.
half	of	 guy 	 s 	 	who	smoke	are	 im 	 potent 	 	.
how	sexy	is	that	?
now	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	about	to	publish	a	 stud 	 y 	 	--	the	first	 stud 	 y 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	you	can	change	gene	 express 	 ion 	 	in	men	with	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	heat	map	--	and	the	different	 color 	 s 	 	--	and	 a 	 long 	 	the	side	,	on	the	right	,	are	different	 gene 	 s 	 	.
and	we	found	that	over	500	 gene 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 favor 	 ably 	 	 change 	 d 	 	--	in	effect	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	on	the	good	 gene 	 s 	 	,	the	disease	-	 prevent 	 ing 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	off	the	disease	-	promoting	 gene 	 s 	 	.
and	so	these	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	i	think	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	giving	 man 	 y 	 	people	new	hope	and	new	 choice 	 s 	 	.
and	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	navigenics	and	dna	direct	and	23andme	,	that	are	giving	you	your	genetic	 profile 	 s 	 	,	are	giving	some	people	a	sense	of	,	``	 go 	 sh 	 	,	well	,	what	can	i	do	about	it	?	``
well	,	our	 gene 	 s 	 	are	not	our	fate	,	and	if	we	make	these	 change 	 s 	 	--	they	're	a	 pre 	 dis 	 position 	 	--	but	if	we	make	 big 	 ger 	 	 change 	 s 	 	than	we	might	have	made	 other 	 wise 	 	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	how	our	 gene 	 s 	 	are	 express 	 ed 	 	.
thank	you	.
