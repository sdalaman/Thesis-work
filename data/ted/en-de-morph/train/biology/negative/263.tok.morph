i	write	about	food	.	i	write	about	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
i	take	it	 quit 	 e 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	but	i	'm	here	to	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	in	the	last	year	or	two	.
it	is	about	food	,	but	it	's	not	about	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	per	 s 	 e 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	picture	of	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	cow	.
i	'm	not	a	 veget 	 arian 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	old	nixon	line	,	right	?
but	i	still	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	--	--	may	be	 th 	 is 	 	year	's	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	that	is	 on 	 ly 	 	a	little	bit	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	.
and	why	do	i	say	it	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	once	before	 ha 	 s 	 	the	fate	of	individual	people	and	the	fate	of	all	of	 human 	 ity 	 	 be 	 en 	 	so	 intertwine 	 d 	 	.
there	was	the	bomb	,	and	there	's	now	.
and	where	we	go	from	here	is	going	to	determine	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	quality	and	the	length	of	our	individual	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	 whet 	 her 	 	,	if	we	could	see	the	earth	a	century	from	now	,	we	'd	 recogn 	 ize 	 	it	.
it	's	a	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	of	a	different	kind	,	and	 hid 	 ing 	 	under	our	 desk 	 s 	 	is	n't	going	to	help	.
start	with	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	real	,	but	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
since	every	scientist	in	the	world	now	 believ 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	even	 p 	 resident 	 	bush	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	the	light	,	or	 pretend 	 s 	 	to	,	we	can	take	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 give 	 n 	 	.
then	hear	 th 	 is 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
after	energy	production	,	 live 	 stock 	 	is	the	second	-	highest	contributor	to	atmosphere	-	 alter 	 ing 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	.
 near 	 ly 	 	one	-	fifth	of	all	 green 	 house 	 	gas	is	generated	by	 live 	 stock 	 	production	--	more	than	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
now	,	you	can	make	all	the	 joke 	 s 	 	you	want	about	cow	 fart 	 s 	 	,	but	 m 	 ethane 	 	is	20	 time 	 s 	 	more	 poison 	 ous 	 	than	co	2	,	and	it	's	not	just	 m 	 ethane 	 	.
 live 	 stock 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 culprit 	 s 	 	in	land	degradation	,	air	and	water	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	water	 short 	 age 	 s 	 	and	loss	of	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
there	's	more	.
like	half	the	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	are	not	 administer 	 ed 	 	to	people	,	but	to	 animal 	 s 	 	.
but	 list 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 	kind	of	 numb 	 ing 	 	,	so	let	me	just	say	 th 	 is 	 	:	if	you	're	a	 progress 	 ive 	 	,	if	you	're	 driv 	 ing 	 	a	prius	,	or	you	're	 shop 	 ping 	 	green	,	or	you	're	looking	for	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	you	should	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	a	semi	-	 veget 	 arian 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	no	more	anti	-	cattle	than	i	am	anti	-	atom	,	but	it	's	all	in	the	way	we	use	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	piece	of	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	,	which	ann	cooper	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	,	and	one	you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	.
there	's	no	question	,	 non 	 e 	 	,	that	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 life 	 style 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	--	diabetes	,	heart	disease	,	stroke	,	some	 cancer 	 s 	 	--	are	 disease 	 s 	 	that	are	far	more	 pre 	 valent 	 	here	than	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	rest	of	the	world	.
and	that	's	the	direct	result	of	eating	a	western	diet	.
our	demand	for	meat	,	 dai 	 ry 	 	and	 refine 	 d 	 	 carbohydrate 	 s 	 	--	the	world	 consum 	 es 	 	one	billion	 can 	 s 	 	or	 bottle 	 s 	 	of	 co 	 ke 	 	a	day	--	our	demand	for	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	not	our	need	,	our	want	,	 drive 	 s 	 	us	to	 consum 	 e 	 	way	more	 calorie 	 s 	 	than	are	good	for	us	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	are	in	 food 	 s 	 	that	cause	,	not	prevent	,	disease	.
now	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	was	 un 	 foresee 	 n 	 	.
we	did	n't	know	that	 poll 	 ution 	 	did	more	than	cause	bad	 vis 	 ibility 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	a	few	lung	 disease 	 s 	 	here	and	there	,	but	,	you	know	,	that	's	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	deal	.
the	current	health	crisis	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	is	a	little	more	the	work	of	the	 e 	 vil 	 	empire	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	told	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 assur 	 ed 	 	,	that	the	more	meat	and	 dai 	 ry 	 	and	 po 	 ul 	 try 	 	we	ate	,	the	 health 	 ier 	 	we	'd	be	.
no	.	 over 	 consumption 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	of	course	,	junk	food	,	is	the	problem	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	our	 pal 	 try 	 	consumption	of	 plant 	 s 	 	.
now	,	there	's	no	time	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	eating	 plant 	 s 	 	here	,	but	the	evidence	is	that	 plant 	 s 	 	--	and	i	want	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	clear	--	it	's	not	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	in	 plant 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	 plant 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	the	beta	-	carotene	,	it	's	the	carrot	.
the	evidence	is	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	that	 plant 	 s 	 	promote	health	.
 th 	 is 	 	evidence	is	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
you	eat	more	 plant 	 s 	 	,	you	eat	less	other	stuff	,	you	live	 long 	 er 	 	.
not	bad	.
but	back	to	 animal 	 s 	 	and	junk	food	.
what	do	they	have	in	common	?
one	:	we	do	n't	need	either	of	them	for	health	.
we	do	n't	need	animal	 product 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	need	white	bread	or	 co 	 ke 	 	.
two	:	both	have	 be 	 en 	 	 market 	 ed 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	,	creating	 un 	 natural 	 	demand	.
we	're	not	born	 crav 	 ing 	 	whoppers	or	skittles	.
three	:	 the 	 ir 	 	production	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	by	government	 age 	 ncies 	 	at	the	expense	of	a	more	health	-	and	earth	-	friendly	diet	.
now	,	let	's	imagine	a	parallel	.
let	's	pretend	that	our	government	 support 	 ed 	 	an	oil	-	based	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	while	 di 	 scour 	 aging 	 	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	energy	,	 know 	 ing 	 	all	the	while	that	the	result	would	be	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	war	and	 ris 	 ing 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 credible 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
yet	they	do	that	.
and	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	here	.	it	's	the	same	deal	.
the	 s 	 ad 	 	thing	is	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	diet	,	is	that	even	when	well	-	intentioned	 fed 	 s 	 	try	to	do	right	by	us	,	they	fail	.
either	they	're	 out 	 vot 	 ed 	 	by	 puppet 	 s 	 	of	 agr 	 i 	 business 	 	,	or	they	are	 puppet 	 s 	 	of	 agr 	 i 	 business 	 	.
so	,	when	the	usda	 final 	 ly 	 	 acknowledg 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 animal 	 s 	 	,	that	made	people	 health 	 y 	 	,	they	 encourag 	 ed 	 	us	,	via	 the 	 ir 	 	 over 	 ly 	 	 simpl 	 istic 	 	food	pyramid	,	to	eat	five	 serv 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 fruit 	 s 	 	and	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	a	day	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	more	 carb 	 s 	 	.
what	they	did	n't	tell	us	is	that	some	 carb 	 s 	 	are	better	than	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 plant 	 s 	 	and	whole	 grain 	 s 	 	should	be	 s 	 up 	 plant 	 ing 	 	eating	junk	food	.
but	industry	 lobby 	 ists 	 	would	never	let	that	happen	.
and	guess	what	?
half	the	people	who	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	food	pyramid	have	ties	to	 agr 	 i 	 business 	 	.
so	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 substitut 	 ing 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	for	 animal 	 s 	 	,	our	swollen	 appetit 	 es 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 large 	 r 	 	,	and	the	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	them	 remain 	 ed 	 	 un 	 change 	 d 	 	.
so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	low	-	fat	 diet 	 s 	 	,	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	low	-	carb	 diet 	 s 	 	--	these	are	not	 solution 	 s 	 	.
but	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	intelligent	people	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	 whet 	 her 	 	food	is	 organ 	 ic 	 	or	local	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	 be 	 ing 	 	nice	to	 animal 	 s 	 	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	just	are	n't	 be 	 ing 	 	 address 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	do	n't	get	me	wrong	.
i	like	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	think	it	's	just	fine	to	 industrial 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	production	and	to	churn	them	out	like	they	 we 	 re 	 	 wrench 	 es 	 	.
but	there	's	no	way	to	treat	 animal 	 s 	 	well	,	when	you	're	 kill 	 ing 	 	10	billion	of	them	a	year	.
that	's	our	number	.	10	billion	.
if	you	 st 	 rung 	 	all	of	them	--	 chicken 	 s 	 	,	 cow 	 s 	 	,	 pig 	 s 	 	and	 lamb 	 s 	 	--	to	the	moon	,	they	'd	go	there	and	back	five	 time 	 s 	 	,	there	and	back	.
now	,	my	math	's	a	little	 sha 	 ky 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	,	and	it	 depend 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	a	pig	is	four	feet	long	or	five	feet	long	,	but	you	get	the	idea	.
that	's	just	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	with	our	hyper	-	consumption	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	producing	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	and	heart	disease	,	 kind 	 ness 	 	might	just	be	a	bit	of	a	red	 her 	 ring 	 	.
let	's	get	the	 number 	 s 	 	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	we	're	 kill 	 ing 	 	for	eating	down	,	and	then	we	'll	worry	about	 be 	 ing 	 	nice	to	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	left	.
 an 	 other 	 	red	 her 	 ring 	 	might	be	 exempl 	 ified 	 	by	the	word	``	locavore	,	``	which	was	just	named	word	of	the	year	by	the	new	oxford	american	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
 serious 	 ly 	 	.
and	locavore	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	know	,	is	 some 	 one 	 	who	eats	 on 	 ly 	 	 local 	 ly 	 	grown	food	--	which	is	fine	if	you	live	in	california	,	but	for	the	rest	of	us	it	's	a	bit	of	a	 s 	 ad 	 	joke	.
between	the	official	story	--	the	food	pyramid	--	and	the	hip	locavore	vision	,	you	have	two	 version 	 s 	 	of	how	to	improve	our	eating	.
they	both	get	it	wrong	,	 th 	 ough 	 	.
the	first	at	 l 	 east 	 	is	 popu 	 list 	 	,	and	the	second	is	 e 	 lit 	 ist 	 	.
how	we	got	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	is	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	food	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	go	through	that	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	right	now	.
a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	guess	what	?
 every 	 one 	 	was	a	locavore	:	even	new	york	had	pig	 farm 	 s 	 	 near 	 by 	 	,	and	 ship 	 ping 	 	food	all	over	the	place	was	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	.

my	mom	is	not	here	,	so	i	can	say	 th 	 is 	 	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 cook 	 ing 	 	drove	me	to	learn	how	to	cook	for	 my 	 self 	 	.
it	was	n't	all	bad	.
by	the	'70s	,	forward	-	 think 	 ing 	 	people	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	value	of	local	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
we	 tend 	 ed 	 	 garden 	 s 	 	,	we	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 organ 	 ic 	 	food	,	we	 k 	 new 	 	or	we	 we 	 re 	 	 veget 	 arian 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	all	 hip 	 pies 	 	,	either	.
some	of	us	 we 	 re 	 	eating	in	good	 restaurant 	 s 	 	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	cook	well	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	food	production	had	 be 	 come 	 	industrial	.	industrial	.

but	 most 	 ly 	 	they	did	n't	eat	 broc 	 coli 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 old 	 	on	yogurt	,	yogurt	 be 	 ing 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	 broc 	 coli 	 	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	the	way	the	industry	 s 	 old 	 	yogurt	was	to	convert	it	to	 some 	 thing 	 	much	more	 a 	 kin 	 	to	ice	cream	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	let	's	look	at	a	granola	bar	.
you	think	that	that	might	be	 health 	 y 	 	food	,	but	in	fact	,	if	you	look	at	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	list	,	it	's	 close 	 r 	 	in	form	to	a	snickers	than	it	is	to	 oat 	 meal 	 	.
 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	that	the	family	 d 	 inner 	 	was	put	in	a	 com 	 a 	 	,	if	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	--	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	 he 	 y 	 day 	 	of	value	-	 add 	 ed 	 	food	,	which	 contain 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 so 	 y 	 	and	corn	 product 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	could	be	 cram 	 med 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
think	of	the	 froze 	 n 	 	chicken	nugget	.
the	chicken	is	fed	corn	,	and	then	 it 	 s 	 	meat	is	ground	up	,	and	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	more	corn	 product 	 s 	 	to	add	bulk	and	 bind 	 er 	 	,	and	then	it	's	fried	in	corn	oil	.
all	you	do	is	nuke	it	.	what	could	be	better	?
and	 zap 	 ped 	 	 horr 	 ibly 	 	,	 pathetic 	 ally 	 	.
by	the	'70s	,	home	 cook 	 ing 	 	was	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 s 	 ad 	 	state	that	the	high	fat	and	spice	 content 	 s 	 	of	 food 	 s 	 	like	mcnuggets	and	hot	 pocket 	 s 	 	--	and	we	all	have	our	 favor 	 ites 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	made	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	more	 appeal 	 ing 	 	than	the	 b 	 land 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	 we 	 re 	 	 serv 	 ing 	 	at	home	.
at	the	same	time	,	 masse 	 s 	 	of	women	 we 	 re 	 	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	 work 	 force 	 	,	and	 cook 	 ing 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	was	n't	 import 	 ant 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	for	men	to	share	the	burden	.
so	now	,	you	've	got	your	pizza	 night 	 s 	 	,	you	've	got	your	 micro 	 wave 	 	 night 	 s 	 	,	you	've	got	your	grazing	 night 	 s 	 	,	you	've	got	your	 f 	 end 	 	-	for	-	 your 	 self 	 	 night 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
 lead 	 ing 	 	the	way	--	what	's	 lead 	 ing 	 	the	way	?
meat	,	junk	food	,	cheese	:	the	 ver 	 y 	 	stuff	that	will	kill	you	.
so	,	now	we	 clam 	 or 	 	for	 organ 	 ic 	 	food	.
that	's	good	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	evidence	that	 thing 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	,	you	can	now	find	 organ 	 ic 	 	food	in	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	,	and	even	in	fast	-	food	 out 	 lets 	 	.
but	 organ 	 ic 	 	food	is	n't	the	answer	either	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	the	way	it	's	 current 	 ly 	 	defined	.
let	me	pose	you	a	question	.
can	farm	-	raised	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	be	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	when	 it 	 s 	 	feed	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 it 	 s 	 	natural	diet	,	even	if	the	feed	 it 	 self 	 	is	 suppose 	 d 	 ly 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	and	the	fish	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	 pack 	 ed 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	in	 pen 	 s 	 	,	 swimm 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	filth	?
and	if	that	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	's	from	chile	,	and	it	's	 kill 	 ed 	 	down	there	and	then	 flow 	 n 	 	5,000	 mile 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	 dump 	 ing 	 	how	much	carbon	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	?
i	do	n't	know	.
 pack 	 ed 	 	in	styrofoam	,	of	course	,	before	 land 	 ing 	 	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 be 	 ing 	 	 truck 	 ed 	 	a	few	hundred	more	 mile 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	be	 organ 	 ic 	 	in	letter	,	but	it	's	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	not	 organ 	 ic 	 	in	spirit	.
now	here	is	where	we	all	meet	.
the	 locavore 	 s 	 	,	the	 organ 	 ivores 	 	,	the	 veget 	 arian 	 s 	 	,	the	vegans	,	the	gourmets	and	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	just	plain	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	good	food	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	've	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	from	different	 point 	 s 	 	,	we	all	have	to	act	on	our	knowledge	to	change	the	way	that	 every 	 one 	 	 think 	 s 	 	about	food	.
we	need	to	start	 act 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	an	issue	of	social	justice	,	 a 	 s 	 	ann	cooper	 s 	 aid 	 	--	and	,	of	course	,	she	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	right	--	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	one	of	global	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
which	 br 	 ing 	 	me	full	circle	and	 point 	 s 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	core	issue	,	the	 over 	 production 	 	and	 over 	 consumption 	 	of	meat	and	junk	food	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	18	percent	of	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	are	 attribut 	 ed 	 	to	 live 	 stock 	 	production	.
how	much	 live 	 stock 	 	do	you	need	to	produce	 th 	 is 	 	?
70	percent	of	the	 agricultur 	 al 	 	land	on	earth	,	30	percent	of	the	earth	's	land	surface	is	 direct 	 ly 	 	or	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	 devote 	 d 	 	to	raising	the	 animal 	 s 	 	we	'll	eat	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	amount	is	 predict 	 ed 	 	to	double	in	the	next	40	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	.
and	if	the	 number 	 s 	 	coming	in	from	 chin 	 a 	 	are	 any 	 thing 	 	like	what	they	look	like	now	,	it	's	not	going	to	be	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
there	is	no	good	reason	for	eating	 a 	 s 	 	much	meat	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	.
and	i	say	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	man	who	 ha 	 s 	 	eaten	a	fair	share	of	 corn 	 ed 	 	beef	in	his	life	.
the	most	common	argument	is	that	we	need	 nutrient 	 s 	 	--	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	eat	,	on	average	,	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	protein	 a 	 s 	 	even	the	industry	-	 obsess 	 ed 	 	usda	 recommend 	 s 	 	.
but	listen	:	 expert 	 s 	 	who	are	serious	about	disease	 r 	 eduction 	 	recommend	that	 adult 	 s 	 	eat	just	over	half	a	pound	of	meat	per	week	.
what	do	you	think	we	eat	per	day	?	half	a	pound	.
but	do	n't	we	need	meat	to	be	big	and	strong	?
is	n't	meat	eating	essential	to	health	?
wo	n't	a	diet	heavy	in	fruit	and	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	turn	us	 in 	 to 	 	 god 	 less 	 	,	 sis 	 s 	 y 	 	,	 liberal 	 s 	 	?
some	of	us	might	think	that	would	be	a	good	thing	.
but	,	no	,	even	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	steroid	-	 fill 	 ed 	 	 foot 	 ball 	 	 player 	 s 	 	,	the	answer	is	no	.
in	fact	,	there	's	no	diet	on	earth	that	 meet 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 nutrition 	 al 	 	 need 	 s 	 	that	wo	n't	promote	growth	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	will	make	you	much	 health 	 ier 	 	than	 our 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
we	do	n't	eat	animal	 product 	 s 	 	for	sufficient	nutrition	,	we	eat	them	to	have	an	odd	form	of	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	,	and	it	's	 kill 	 ing 	 	us	.
to	suggest	that	in	the	 interest 	 s 	 	of	personal	and	human	health	americans	eat	50	percent	less	meat	--	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	of	a	cut	,	but	it	's	a	start	.
it	would	seem	absurd	,	but	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	should	happen	,	and	what	 progress 	 ive 	 	people	,	forward	-	 think 	 ing 	 	people	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	and	 advoc 	 ating 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	 correspond 	 ing 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	consumption	of	 plant 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	writing	about	food	more	or	less	 omni 	 vor 	 ously 	 	--	one	might	say	 in 	 discriminate 	 ly 	 	--	for	about	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	i	've	eaten	and	 recommend 	 ed 	 	eating	just	about	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	'll	never	stop	eating	 animal 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	,	but	i	do	think	that	for	the	benefit	of	 every 	 one 	 	,	the	time	 ha 	 s 	 	come	to	stop	raising	them	 industrial 	 ly 	 	and	stop	eating	them	 thought 	 lessly 	 	.
ann	cooper	's	right	.
the	usda	is	not	our	ally	here	.
we	have	to	take	 matter 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	own	 hand 	 s 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	by	 advoc 	 ating 	 	for	a	better	diet	for	 every 	 one 	 	--	and	that	's	the	hard	part	--	but	by	 improv 	 ing 	 	our	own	.
and	that	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	easy	.
less	meat	,	less	junk	,	more	 plant 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	simple	formula	:	eat	food	.
eat	real	food	.
we	can	 continu 	 e 	 	to	enjoy	our	food	,	and	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	eat	well	,	and	we	can	eat	even	better	.
we	can	 continu 	 e 	 	the	search	for	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	we	love	,	and	we	can	 continu 	 e 	 	to	spin	 yarn 	 s 	 	about	our	 favor 	 ite 	 	 meal 	 s 	 	.
we	'll	 reduc 	 e 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	,	but	our	carbon	 foot 	 print 	 	.
we	can	make	food	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	not	less	,	and	 s 	 ave 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	so	.
we	have	to	 choos 	 e 	 	that	path	.
thank	you	.
