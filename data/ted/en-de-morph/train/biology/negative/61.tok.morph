if	you	have	n't	 order 	 ed 	 	yet	,	i	 general 	 ly 	 	find	the	rigatoni	with	the	 s 	 pic 	 y 	 	tomato	sauce	 go 	 es 	 	best	with	 disease 	 s 	 	of	the	small	intestine	.
so	,	sorry	--	it	just	 feel 	 s 	 	like	i	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	stand	-	up	up	here	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	setting	.
no	,	what	i	want	to	do	is	take	you	back	to	1854	in	london	for	the	next	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	tell	the	story	--	in	brief	--	of	 th 	 is 	 	 out 	 break 	 	,	which	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	i	think	,	 help 	 ed 	 	create	the	world	that	we	live	in	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	kind	of	city	that	we	live	in	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	period	in	1854	,	in	the	middle	part	of	the	19th	century	,	in	london	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	for	a	number	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	one	is	that	london	was	 th 	 is 	 	city	of	2.5	million	people	,	and	it	was	the	largest	city	on	the	face	of	the	planet	at	that	point	.
but	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	the	largest	city	that	had	ever	 be 	 en 	 	built	.
and	so	the	victorians	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	live	through	and	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	invent	a	whole	new	scale	of	living	:	 th 	 is 	 	scale	of	living	that	we	,	you	know	,	now	call	``	 metro 	 politan 	 	living	.	``
and	it	was	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	the	mid	-	1850s	,	a	complete	disaster	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	city	living	with	a	modern	kind	of	industrial	 metro 	 poli 	 s 	 	with	an	elizabethan	public	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
so	people	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	just	to	gross	you	out	for	a	second	,	had	 cess 	 pool 	 s 	 	of	human	waste	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 base 	 ment 	 	.	like	,	a	foot	to	two	feet	deep	.
and	they	would	just	kind	of	throw	the	 buck 	 et 	 s 	 	down	there	and	hope	that	it	would	 some 	 how 	 	go	away	,	and	of	course	it	never	 re 	 ally 	 	would	go	away	.
and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	had	 accumul 	 ated 	 	to	the	point	where	the	city	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	offensive	to	just	walk	around	in	.
it	was	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 smell 	 y 	 	city	.	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 cess 	 pool 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	 she 	 er 	 	number	of	 live 	 stock 	 	in	the	city	would	shock	people	.
not	just	the	 horse 	 s 	 	,	but	people	had	 cow 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 at 	 tics 	 	that	they	would	use	for	milk	,	that	they	would	 ho 	 ist 	 	up	there	and	keep	them	in	the	 at 	 tic 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	milk	ran	out	and	they	 di 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	they	would	drag	them	off	to	the	bone	 boil 	 ers 	 	down	the	street	.
so	,	you	would	just	walk	around	london	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	and	just	be	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 sten 	 ch 	 	.
and	what	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	an	entire	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	public	health	system	 be 	 came 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	it	was	the	smell	that	was	 kill 	 ing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	,	that	was	creating	these	 disease 	 s 	 	that	would	wipe	through	the	city	every	three	or	four	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	cholera	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	great	killer	of	 th 	 is 	 	period	.
it	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	london	in	1832	,	and	every	four	or	five	 year 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	would	take	10,000	,	20,000	people	in	london	and	 through 	 out 	 	the	u.k	.
and	so	the	 author 	 ities 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	smell	was	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
we	had	to	get	rid	of	the	smell	.
and	so	,	in	fact	,	they	 concoct 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	early	,	you	know	,	 found 	 ing 	 	public	-	health	 intervention 	 s 	 	in	the	system	of	the	city	,	one	of	which	was	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	nuisances	act	,	``	which	they	got	 every 	 body 	 	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	they	could	to	empty	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 cess 	 pool 	 s 	 	and	just	pour	all	that	waste	 in 	 to 	 	the	river	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	get	it	out	of	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	it	'll	smell	much	better	,	and	--	oh	right	,	we	drink	from	the	river	.
so	what	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	they	 end 	 ed 	 	up	increasing	the	 out 	 break 	 s 	 	of	cholera	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	now	know	,	cholera	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	water	.
it	's	a	 water 	 borne 	 	disease	,	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	in	the	air	.
it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	smell	or	 inhal 	 e 	 	;	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	you	 ing 	 est 	 	.
and	so	one	of	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	public	health	in	the	19th	century	 effective 	 ly 	 	 poison 	 ed 	 	the	water	supply	of	london	much	more	 effective 	 ly 	 	than	any	modern	day	 bio 	 terrorist 	 	could	have	ever	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	state	of	london	in	1854	,	and	in	the	middle	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	 car 	 n 	 age 	 	and	offensive	 condition 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	scientific	 con 	 fusion 	 	about	what	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	people	,	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 talent 	 ed 	 	classic	19th	century	multi	-	disciplinarian	named	john	snow	,	who	was	a	local	doctor	in	soho	in	london	,	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 argu 	 ing 	 	for	about	four	or	five	 year 	 s 	 	that	cholera	was	,	in	fact	,	a	 water 	 borne 	 	disease	,	and	had	 bas 	 ically 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	 no 	 body 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	public	health	 author 	 ities 	 	had	 large 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	what	he	had	to	say	.
and	he	'd	made	the	case	in	a	number	of	 paper 	 s 	 	and	 d 	 one 	 	a	number	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	had	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
and	part	of	--	what	's	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	story	to	me	is	that	in	some	ways	,	it	's	a	great	case	 stud 	 y 	 	in	how	cultural	change	 happen 	 s 	 	,	how	a	good	idea	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	win	out	over	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	snow	 labor 	 ed 	 	for	a	long	time	with	 th 	 is 	 	great	 in 	 sight 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	on	one	day	,	august	28th	of	1854	,	a	young	child	,	a	five	-	month	-	old	girl	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	first	name	we	do	n't	know	,	we	know	her	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	baby	lewis	,	 some 	 how 	 	 contract 	 ed 	 	cholera	,	came	down	with	cholera	at	40	broad	street	.
you	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	see	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	map	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	central	focus	in	the	second	half	of	my	book	.
it	's	in	the	middle	of	soho	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	class	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	sick	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	 cess 	 pool 	 	,	that	they	still	 continu 	 e 	 	to	have	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	nuisances	act	,	 border 	 ed 	 	on	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	popular	water	pump	,	local	 water 	 ing 	 	hole	that	was	well	known	for	the	best	water	in	all	of	soho	,	that	all	the	 resident 	 s 	 	from	soho	and	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	would	go	to	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	 in 	 advert 	 ent 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 contami 	 nating 	 	the	water	in	 th 	 is 	 	popular	pump	,	and	one	of	the	most	 terrify 	 ing 	 	 out 	 break 	 s 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	england	 erupt 	 ed 	 	about	two	or	three	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
 liter 	 ally 	 	,	10	percent	of	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	in	seven	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	much	more	would	have	 di 	 ed 	 	if	people	had	n't	 fl 	 ed 	 	after	the	 initi 	 al 	 	 out 	 break 	 	 kick 	 ed 	 	in	.
so	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 terrify 	 ing 	 	event	.
you	had	these	 scene 	 s 	 	of	entire	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	over	the	course	of	48	 hour 	 s 	 	of	cholera	,	 al 	 one 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	one	-	room	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 flat 	 s 	 	.
just	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	 terrify 	 ing 	 	scene	.
snow	lived	near	there	,	heard	about	the	 out 	 break 	 	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	act	of	courage	went	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bel 	 ly 	 	of	the	beast	 be 	 cause 	 	he	thought	an	 out 	 break 	 	that	 concent 	 rated 	 	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 potential 	 ly 	 	end	up	convincing	people	that	,	in	fact	,	the	real	 menac 	 e 	 	of	cholera	was	in	the	water	supply	and	not	in	the	air	.
he	 suspect 	 ed 	 	an	 out 	 break 	 	that	 concent 	 rated 	 	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	involve	a	single	point	source	.
one	single	thing	that	 every 	 body 	 	was	going	to	 be 	 cause 	 	it	did	n't	have	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 s 	 lower 	 	path	of	 infect 	 ions 	 	that	you	might	expect	.
and	so	he	went	right	in	there	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 interview 	 ing 	 	people	.
he	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 enlist 	 ed 	 	the	help	of	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	other	figure	,	who	's	kind	of	the	other	protagonist	of	the	book	--	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	henry	whitehead	,	who	was	a	local	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	who	was	not	at	all	a	man	of	science	,	but	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 social 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	;	he	 k 	 new 	 	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
and	he	 manage 	 d 	 	to	track	down	,	whitehead	did	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 case 	 s 	 	of	people	who	had	drunk	water	from	the	pump	,	or	who	had	n't	drunk	water	from	the	pump	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	snow	made	a	map	of	the	 out 	 break 	 	.
he	found	 increasing 	 ly 	 	that	people	who	 d 	 rank 	 	from	the	pump	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	sick	.
people	who	had	n't	drunk	from	the	pump	 we 	 re 	 	not	 get 	 ting 	 	sick	.
and	he	thought	about	 represent 	 ing 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	a	table	of	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	people	living	in	different	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	,	people	who	had	n't	,	you	know	,	 percent 	 age 	 s 	 	of	people	who	had	n't	,	but	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	he	hit	 up 	 on 	 	the	idea	that	what	he	 need 	 ed 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	could	see	.
 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	take	in	a	sense	a	 high 	 er 	 	-	level	view	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	activity	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
and	so	he	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 represent 	 ing 	 	all	the	 death 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	black	 bar 	 s 	 	at	each	address	.
and	you	can	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	the	pump	right	at	the	center	of	it	and	you	can	see	that	one	of	the	 residence 	 s 	 	down	the	way	had	about	15	people	dead	.
and	the	map	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	little	bit	 big 	 ger 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	get	further	and	further	away	from	the	pump	,	the	 death 	 s 	 	begin	to	grow	less	and	less	frequent	.
and	so	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 poison 	 ous 	 	 e 	 man 	 ating 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	pump	that	you	could	see	in	a	glance	.
and	so	,	with	the	help	of	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	and	with	the	help	of	more	 evangel 	 izing 	 	that	he	did	over	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	and	that	whitehead	did	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 author 	 ities 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	come	around	.
it	took	much	 long 	 er 	 	than	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	like	to	think	in	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	but	by	1866	,	when	the	next	big	cholera	 out 	 break 	 	came	to	london	,	the	 author 	 ities 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	--	in	part	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	in	part	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	map	--	that	in	fact	the	water	was	the	problem	.
and	they	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	building	the	 sew 	 ers 	 	in	london	,	and	they	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	 out 	 break 	 	and	they	told	 every 	 body 	 	to	start	 boil 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	water	.
and	that	was	the	last	time	that	london	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	cholera	 out 	 break 	 	since	.
so	,	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	i	think	--	well	,	it	's	a	 terrify 	 ing 	 	story	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	dark	story	and	it	's	a	story	that	 continu 	 es 	 	on	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	cities	of	the	world	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	story	 re 	 ally 	 	that	is	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	,	which	is	to	say	that	it	's	possible	to	solve	these	 problem 	 s 	 	if	we	listen	to	reason	,	if	we	listen	to	the	kind	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 map 	 s 	 	,	if	we	listen	to	people	like	snow	and	whitehead	,	if	we	listen	to	the	 local 	 s 	 	who	understand	what	's	going	on	in	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
and	what	it	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 do 	 ing 	 	is	making	the	idea	of	large	-	scale	 metro 	 politan 	 	living	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	one	.
when	people	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	10	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	the	space	of	seven	 day 	 s 	 	,	there	was	a	 wide 	 spread 	 	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	could	n't	go	on	,	that	people	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 me 	 ant 	 	to	live	in	cities	of	2.5	million	people	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	snow	did	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 reform 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	wake	of	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	we	now	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	that	cities	have	10	million	people	,	cities	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	are	in	fact	 sustain 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	worry	that	new	york	city	is	going	to	collapse	in	on	 it 	 self 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	the	way	that	,	you	know	,	rome	did	,	and	be	10	percent	of	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	in	100	 year 	 s 	 	or	200	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	so	that	in	a	way	is	the	ultimate	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	map	.
it	's	a	map	of	 death 	 s 	 	that	 end 	 ed 	 	up	creating	a	whole	new	way	of	life	,	the	life	that	we	're	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
