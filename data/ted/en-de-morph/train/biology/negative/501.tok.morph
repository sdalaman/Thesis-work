 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	for	a	few	 reason 	 s 	 	.
 read 	 ers 	 	do	n't	want	to	pay	for	 yester 	 day 	 	's	news	,	and	 advertise 	 rs 	 	follow	them	.
your	iphone	,	your	 lap 	 top 	 	,	is	much	more	 hand 	 y 	 	than	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	on	sunday	.
and	we	should	 s 	 ave 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	in	the	end	.
so	it	's	 en 	 ough 	 	to	bury	any	industry	.
so	,	should	we	 ra 	 ther 	 	ask	,	``	can	 any 	 thing 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	?	``
there	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 scenario 	 s 	 	for	the	future	 news 	 paper 	 	.
some	people	say	it	should	be	free	;	it	should	be	tabloid	,	or	even	 small 	 er 	 	:	a	4	;	it	should	be	local	,	run	by	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	or	niche	,	for	some	 small 	 er 	 	 group 	 s 	 	like	business	--	but	then	it	's	not	free	;	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	.
it	should	be	opinion	-	driven	;	less	news	,	more	 view 	 s 	 	.
and	we	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	read	it	 dur 	 ing 	 	 break 	 fast 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	we	listen	to	radio	in	a	car	,	check	your	mail	at	work	and	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	you	watch	tv	.
 sound 	 s 	 	nice	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	buy	time	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	long	run	,	i	think	there	is	no	reason	,	no	practical	reason	for	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
so	what	can	we	do	?
let	me	tell	you	my	story	.
20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	bonnier	,	swedish	 publish 	 er 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	to	set	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	in	the	 form 	 er 	 	soviet	 b 	 loc 	 	.
after	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	had	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	in	central	and	eastern	europe	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	run	by	an	 in 	 experience 	 d 	 	staff	,	with	no	visual	culture	,	no	 budget 	 s 	 	for	 visual 	 s 	 	--	in	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	not	even	art	 director 	 s 	 	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	be	--	to	work	for	them	 a 	 s 	 	an	art	director	.
before	,	i	was	an	architect	,	and	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	once	,	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	for	a	living	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 design 	 ing 	 	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	.	``
``	what	?	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	design	there	.	it	's	just	 bor 	 ing 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	``	and	she	was	right	.	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	one	day	.
i	came	to	london	,	and	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	performance	by	cirque	du	soleil	.
and	i	had	a	 revel 	 ation 	 	.	i	thought	,	``	these	 guy 	 s 	 	took	some	 creep 	 y 	 	,	run	-	down	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	and	put	it	to	the	highest	possible	level	of	performance	art	.	``
i	thought	``	oh	my	god	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	can	do	the	same	with	these	 bor 	 ing 	 	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	did	.	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 design 	 	them	,	one	by	one	.
the	front	page	 be 	 came 	 	our	signature	.
it	was	my	personal	 intima 	 te 	 	channel	to	talk	to	the	 read 	 ers 	 	.
i	'm	not	going	to	tell	you	 st 	 ories 	 	about	 team 	 work 	 	or	 co 	 operation 	 	.
my	approach	was	 ver 	 y 	 	egotistic	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	my	 art 	 istic 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	,	my	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	 post 	 ers 	 	,	not	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
not	even	 magazine 	 s 	 	:	 post 	 ers 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	type	,	with	 illustr 	 ation 	 	,	with	 photo 	 s 	 	.	and	we	had	 f 	 un 	 	.
soon	it	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
in	poland	,	our	 page 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	named	``	 cover 	 s 	 	of	the	year	``	three	 time 	 s 	 	in	a	row	.
other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	you	can	see	here	are	from	latvia	,	lithuania	,	estonia	--	the	central	european	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	about	the	front	page	.
the	secret	is	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 treat 	 ing 	 	the	whole	 news 	 paper 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	piece	,	 a 	 s 	 	one	 com 	 position 	 	--	like	music	.
and	music	 ha 	 s 	 	a	rhythm	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 up 	 s 	 	and	 down 	 s 	 	.
and	design	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	experience	.
 flip 	 ping 	 	through	 page 	 s 	 	is	 read 	 ers 	 	experience	,	and	i	'm	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	experience	.
we	 treat 	 ed 	 	two	 page 	 s 	 	,	both	 spread 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	one	page	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	how	 read 	 ers 	 	perceive	it	.
you	can	see	some	russian	 page 	 s 	 	here	which	got	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	on	 big 	 gest 	 	 info 	 graphic 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	in	spain	.
but	the	real	 a 	 ward 	 	came	from	 socie 	 ty 	 	for	 news 	 paper 	 	design	.
just	a	year	after	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	in	poland	,	they	name	it	the	world	's	best	-	designed	 news 	 paper 	 	.
and	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	same	 a 	 ward 	 	came	to	estonia	.
is	n't	 amaz 	 ing 	 	?
what	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	 amaz 	 ing 	 	:	that	the	 circul 	 ation 	 	of	these	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	growing	too	.
just	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	:	in	russia	,	plus	11	after	one	year	,	plus	29	after	three	 year 	 s 	 	of	the	 re 	 design 	 	.
same	in	poland	:	plus	13	,	up	to	35	percent	raise	of	 circul 	 ation 	 	after	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	on	a	graph	,	after	 year 	 s 	 	of	 stag 	 nation 	 	,	the	paper	 start 	 ed 	 	to	grow	,	just	after	 re 	 design 	 	.
but	the	real	hit	was	in	bulgaria	.
and	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
did	design	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
design	was	just	a	part	of	the	process	.
and	the	process	we	made	was	not	about	changing	the	look	,	it	was	about	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	product	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
i	took	an	 architect 	 ural 	 	rule	about	function	and	form	and	 transl 	 ated 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	content	and	design	.
and	i	put	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	at	the	top	of	it	.
so	first	you	ask	a	big	question	:	why	we	do	it	?	what	is	the	goal	?
then	we	adjust	the	content	 accord 	 ing 	 ly 	 	.
and	then	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	after	two	 month 	 s 	 	,	we	start	 design 	 ing 	 	.
my	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	,	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	.
why	am	i	 ask 	 ing 	 	all	of	these	business	 question 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 show 	 ing 	 	them	 page 	 s 	 	?
but	soon	they	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	role	of	 design 	 er 	 	:	to	be	in	 th 	 is 	 	process	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	.
so	what	is	the	 less 	 on 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	it	?
the	first	 less 	 on 	 	is	about	that	design	can	change	not	just	your	product	.
it	can	change	your	 work 	 flow 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	can	change	 every 	 thing 	 	in	your	company	;	it	can	turn	your	company	 up 	 side 	 	down	.
it	can	even	change	you	.
and	who	's	 respons 	 ible 	 	?	 design 	 ers 	 	.
give	power	to	 design 	 ers 	 	.
but	the	second	is	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.
you	can	live	in	a	small	poor	country	,	like	me	.
you	can	work	for	a	small	company	,	in	a	 bor 	 ing 	 	branch	.
you	can	have	no	 budget 	 s 	 	,	no	people	--	but	still	can	put	your	work	to	the	highest	possible	level	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	can	do	it	.
you	just	need	inspiration	,	vision	and	 determi 	 nation 	 	.
and	you	need	to	remember	that	to	be	good	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
thank	you	.
