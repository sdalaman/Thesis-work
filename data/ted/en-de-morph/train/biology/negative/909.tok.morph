thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	excuse	me	for	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	;	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	old	.
well	,	the	 top 	 ic 	 	i	'm	going	to	discuss	is	one	which	is	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	 ver 	 y 	 	peculiar	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	old	.
 rough 	 ness 	 	is	part	of	human	life	 fore 	 ver 	 	and	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	and	ancient	 author 	 s 	 	have	written	about	it	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 un 	 controll 	 able 	 	,	and	in	a	certain	sense	,	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	just	a	mess	,	a	mess	and	a	mess	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	mess	.
now	,	in	fact	,	by	a	complete	 flu 	 ke 	 	,	i	got	 involve 	 d 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	a	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	form	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	and	to	my	utter	 amaze 	 ment 	 	,	i	found	 trace 	 s 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 trace 	 s 	 	,	i	must	say	--	of	order	in	that	 rough 	 ness 	 	.
and	so	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	would	like	to	present	to	you	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	.
i	prefer	the	word	 rough 	 ness 	 	to	the	word	 ir 	 regular 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 ir 	 regular 	 ity 	 	--	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	had	latin	in	my	long	-	past	youth	--	 mean 	 s 	 	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	of	 regular 	 ity 	 	.
but	it	is	not	so	.
 regular 	 ity 	 	is	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	of	 rough 	 ness 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	world	is	 ver 	 y 	 	rough	.
so	let	me	show	you	a	few	 object 	 s 	 	.
some	of	them	are	artificial	.
 other 	 s 	 	of	them	are	 ver 	 y 	 	real	,	in	a	certain	sense	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	real	.	it	's	a	 cauli 	 flower 	 	.
now	why	do	i	show	a	 cauli 	 flower 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	and	ancient	 veget 	 able 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	old	and	ancient	 a 	 s 	 	it	may	be	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	both	at	the	same	time	.
if	you	try	to	weigh	it	--	of	course	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	weigh	it	,	and	when	you	eat	it	,	the	weight	 matter 	 s 	 	--	but	suppose	you	try	to	measure	 it 	 s 	 	surface	.
well	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	cut	,	with	a	sharp	knife	,	one	of	the	 flor 	 et 	 s 	 	of	a	 cauli 	 flower 	 	and	look	at	it	 separat 	 e 	 ly 	 	,	you	think	of	a	whole	 cauli 	 flower 	 	,	but	 small 	 er 	 	.
and	then	you	cut	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	you	still	get	small	 cauli 	 flower 	 s 	 	.
so	the	experience	of	 human 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	there	are	some	 shape 	 s 	 	which	have	 th 	 is 	 	peculiar	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	that	each	part	is	like	the	whole	,	but	 small 	 er 	 	.
now	,	what	did	 human 	 ity 	 	do	with	that	?
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	little	.
so	what	i	did	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	and	i	found	 some 	 thing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	surprising	.
that	one	can	measure	 rough 	 ness 	 	by	a	number	,	a	number	,	2.3	,	1.2	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	much	more	.
one	day	,	a	friend	of	mine	,	to	bug	me	,	 br 	 ought 	 	a	picture	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	is	the	 rough 	 ness 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	just	short	of	1.5	.	``
it	was	1.48	.
now	,	it	did	n't	take	me	any	time	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	these	 thing 	 s 	 	for	so	long	.
so	these	 number 	 s 	 	are	the	 number 	 s 	 	which	 de 	 note 	 	the	 rough 	 ness 	 	of	these	 surface 	 s 	 	.
i	 ha 	 sten 	 	to	say	that	these	 surface 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	artificial	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 d 	 one 	 	on	a	computer	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 in 	 put 	 	is	a	number	,	and	that	number	is	 rough 	 ness 	 	.
so	on	the	left	,	i	took	the	 rough 	 ness 	 	 cop 	 ied 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	.
to	the	right	,	i	took	a	 high 	 er 	 	 rough 	 ness 	 	.
so	the	eye	,	after	a	while	,	can	distinguish	these	two	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
 human 	 ity 	 	had	to	learn	about	 measur 	 ing 	 	 rough 	 ness 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	rough	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	smooth	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	smooth	.
 ver 	 y 	 	few	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	.
so	then	if	you	try	to	ask	 question 	 s 	 	:	``	what	's	the	surface	of	a	 cauli 	 flower 	 	?	``
well	,	you	measure	and	measure	and	measure	.
each	time	you	're	 close 	 r 	 	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	,	down	to	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 distance 	 s 	 	.
what	's	the	length	of	the	 coast 	 line 	 	of	these	 lake 	 s 	 	?
the	 close 	 r 	 	you	measure	,	the	 long 	 er 	 	it	is	.
the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	length	of	 coast 	 line 	 	,	which	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	so	natural	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 give 	 n 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	is	,	in	fact	,	complete	 fall 	 acy 	 	;	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	.
you	must	do	it	 different 	 ly 	 	.
what	good	is	that	,	to	know	these	 thing 	 s 	 	?
well	,	 surprising 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	it	's	good	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
to	begin	with	,	artificial	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	which	i	 invent 	 ed 	 	sort	of	,	are	used	in	cinema	all	the	time	.
we	see	 mountain 	 s 	 	in	the	distance	.
they	may	be	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	but	they	may	be	just	 formula 	 e 	 	,	just	 crank 	 ed 	 	on	.
now	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	do	.
it	used	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	time	-	 consum 	 ing 	 	,	but	now	it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
now	look	at	that	.	that	's	a	real	lung	.
now	a	lung	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	.
if	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	you	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	it	 weigh 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	.
the	volume	of	a	lung	is	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	but	what	about	the	area	of	the	lung	?
 anatomist 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 argu 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	that	.
some	say	that	a	normal	male	's	lung	 ha 	 s 	 	an	area	of	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	 basket 	 ball 	 	[	court	]	.
and	the	 other 	 s 	 	say	,	no	,	five	 basket 	 ball 	 	[	 court 	 s 	 	]	.
enormous	 disagree 	 ments 	 	.
why	so	?	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	fact	,	the	area	of	the	lung	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	ill	-	defined	.
the	bronchi	branch	,	branch	,	branch	and	they	stop	 branch 	 ing 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	any	matter	of	principle	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	physical	 consider 	 ations 	 	:	the	 mu 	 cus 	 	,	which	is	in	the	lung	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	in	a	way	you	have	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	lung	,	but	it	 branch 	 es 	 	and	 branch 	 es 	 	down	to	 distance 	 s 	 	about	the	same	for	a	whale	,	for	a	man	and	for	a	little	 rod 	 ent 	 	.
now	,	what	good	is	it	to	have	that	?
well	,	 surprising 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	the	 anatomist 	 s 	 	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	idea	of	the	structure	of	the	lung	 un 	 til 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	think	that	my	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	of	great	help	to	the	 surgeon 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	lung	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 kid 	 ney 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	,	all	these	 branch 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	for	which	there	was	no	 geo 	 metry 	 	.
so	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 construct 	 ing 	 	a	 geo 	 metry 	 	,	a	 geo 	 metry 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	which	had	no	 geo 	 metry 	 	.
and	a	surprising	 a 	 spect 	 	of	it	is	that	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 geo 	 metry 	 	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	short	.
you	have	 formula 	 s 	 	that	long	.
and	you	crank	it	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	:	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	same	 re 	 petition 	 	.
and	at	the	end	,	you	get	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	cloud	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	100	percent	artificial	.
well	,	99.9	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	part	which	is	natural	is	a	number	,	the	 rough 	 ness 	 	of	the	cloud	,	which	is	taken	from	nature	.
 some 	 thing 	 	so	 complic 	 ated 	 	like	a	cloud	,	so	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	,	so	 vary 	 ing 	 	,	should	have	a	simple	rule	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	simple	rule	is	not	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	of	 cloud 	 s 	 	.
the	 s 	 eer 	 	of	 cloud 	 s 	 	had	to	take	account	of	it	.
i	do	n't	know	how	much	 advance 	 d 	 	these	 picture 	 s 	 	are	.	they	're	old	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 involve 	 d 	 	in	it	,	but	then	 turn 	 ed 	 	my	attention	to	other	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
now	,	here	is	 an 	 other 	 	thing	which	is	 ra 	 ther 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
one	of	the	 shatter 	 ing 	 	 event 	 s 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	which	is	not	 appreciate 	 d 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	 occur 	 red 	 	about	130	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	145	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 mathematic 	 ians 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	create	 shape 	 s 	 	that	did	n't	exist	.
 mathematic 	 ians 	 	got	 in 	 to 	 	self	-	praise	to	an	 ex 	 tent 	 	which	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	that	man	can	invent	 thing 	 s 	 	that	nature	did	not	know	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	it	could	invent	 thing 	 s 	 	like	a	 curv 	 e 	 	which	 fill 	 s 	 	the	plane	.
a	 curv 	 e 	 	's	a	 curv 	 e 	 	,	a	plane	's	a	plane	,	and	the	two	wo	n't	mix	.
well	,	they	do	mix	.
a	man	named	peano	did	define	 s 	 uch 	 	 curv 	 es 	 	,	and	it	 be 	 came 	 	an	object	of	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	interest	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	 most 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	a	kind	of	break	,	a	 separat 	 ion 	 	between	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	coming	from	 re 	 ality 	 	,	on	the	one	hand	,	and	new	 mathematic 	 s 	 	coming	from	 pur 	 e 	 	man	's	mind	.
well	,	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	sorry	to	point	out	that	the	 pur 	 e 	 	man	's	mind	 ha 	 s 	 	,	in	fact	,	 s 	 een 	 	at	long	last	what	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	for	a	long	time	.
and	so	here	i	 introduc 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	the	set	of	 river 	 s 	 	of	a	plane	-	 fill 	 ing 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	.
and	well	,	it	's	a	story	 un 	 to 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	it	was	in	1875	to	1925	,	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	period	in	which	 mathematic 	 s 	 	prepared	 it 	 self 	 	to	break	out	from	the	world	.
and	the	 object 	 s 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	used	 a 	 s 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	when	i	was	a	child	and	a	student	,	 a 	 s 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	break	between	 mathematic 	 s 	 	and	visible	 re 	 ality 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	them	 complete 	 ly 	 	around	.
i	used	them	for	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	nature	.
well	,	a	man	named	hausdorff	in	1919	 introduc 	 ed 	 	a	number	which	was	just	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	joke	,	and	i	found	that	 th 	 is 	 	number	was	a	good	 measure 	 ment 	 	of	 rough 	 ness 	 	.
when	i	first	told	it	to	my	 friend 	 s 	 	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	be	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	.	it	's	just	 some 	 thing 	 	[	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	]	.	``
well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	was	not	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	.
the	great	 paint 	 er 	 	hokusai	 k 	 new 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
the	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	are	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	.
he	did	not	know	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	;	it	did	n't	yet	exist	.
and	he	was	japanese	who	had	no	contact	with	the	west	.
but	 paint 	 ing 	 	for	a	long	time	had	a	 fract 	 al 	 	side	.
i	could	speak	of	that	for	a	long	time	.
the	eiffel	tower	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 fract 	 al 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	.
i	read	the	book	that	mr.	eiffel	wrote	about	his	tower	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	it	was	 astonish 	 ing 	 	how	much	he	 under 	 stood 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	mess	,	mess	,	mess	,	brownian	loop	.
one	day	i	 decide 	 d 	 	--	 half 	 way 	 	through	my	 care 	 er 	 	,	i	was	held	by	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	my	work	--	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	test	 my 	 self 	 	.
could	i	just	look	at	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 every 	 body 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	for	a	long	time	and	find	 some 	 thing 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	new	?
well	,	so	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	brownian	motion	--	just	 go 	 es 	 	around	.
i	 play 	 ed 	 	with	it	for	a	while	,	and	i	made	it	return	to	the	origin	.
then	i	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	my	 assist 	 ant 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	see	 any 	 thing 	 	.	can	you	paint	it	?	``
so	he	 paint 	 ed 	 	it	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	he	put	 in 	 side 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	:	``	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	thing	came	out	.	.	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	stop	!	stop	!	stop	!
i	see	;	it	's	an	 is 	 land 	 	.	``
and	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
so	brownian	motion	,	which	 happen 	 s 	 	to	have	a	 rough 	 ness 	 	number	of	two	,	 go 	 es 	 	around	.
i	 measur 	 ed 	 	it	,	1.33	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	.
long	 measure 	 ments 	 	,	big	brownian	 motion 	 s 	 	,	1.33	.
 mathematic 	 al 	 	problem	:	how	to	prove	it	?
it	took	my	 friend 	 s 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
three	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 in 	 complete 	 	 proof 	 s 	 	.
they	got	together	,	and	together	they	had	the	proof	.
so	they	got	the	big	[	 field 	 s 	 	]	 med 	 al 	 	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	one	of	the	three	 med 	 al 	 s 	 	that	people	have	 receiv 	 ed 	 	for	 prov 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	which	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	prove	them	.
now	 every 	 body 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	me	at	one	point	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	``	how	did	it	all	start	?
what	got	you	in	that	strange	business	?	``
what	got	you	to	be	,	at	the	same	time	,	a	 mechanic 	 al 	 	engineer	,	a	 ge 	 ographer 	 	and	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	and	so	on	,	a	physicist	?
well	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	,	 odd 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	stock	market	 price 	 s 	 	.
and	so	here	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	,	and	i	wrote	 book 	 s 	 	about	it	--	financial	 price 	 s 	 	 increment 	 s 	 	.
to	the	left	you	see	data	over	a	long	period	.
to	the	right	,	on	top	,	you	see	a	 theor 	 y 	 	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 fashion 	 able 	 	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	,	and	you	can	write	 man 	 y 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	about	it	.
there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	on	that	.
now	 compar 	 e 	 	that	with	real	price	 increment 	 s 	 	.
where	are	real	price	 increment 	 s 	 	?
well	,	these	other	lines	include	some	real	price	 increment 	 s 	 	and	some	 forger 	 y 	 	which	i	did	.
so	the	idea	there	was	that	one	must	be	able	to	--	how	do	you	say	?	--	model	price	 vari 	 ation 	 	.
and	it	went	 re 	 ally 	 	well	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
for	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	sort	of	pooh	-	poohing	me	 be 	 cause 	 	they	could	do	it	much	,	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
but	i	tell	you	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	people	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
these	two	 curv 	 es 	 	are	 average 	 s 	 	:	and	the	red	one	is	standard	&	poor	's	from	which	the	five	 big 	 gest 	 	 dis 	 continu 	 ities 	 	are	taken	out	.
now	 dis 	 continu 	 ities 	 	are	a	 nuis 	 ance 	 	,	so	in	 man 	 y 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 price 	 s 	 	,	one	 put 	 s 	 	them	 a 	 side 	 	.
``	well	,	 act 	 s 	 	of	god	.
and	you	have	the	little	 non 	 sense 	 	which	is	left	.
 act 	 s 	 	of	god	.	``	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	five	 act 	 s 	 	of	god	are	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	is	not	 act 	 s 	 	of	god	that	we	should	put	 a 	 side 	 	.
that	is	the	meat	,	the	problem	.
if	you	master	these	,	you	master	price	,	and	if	you	do	n't	master	these	,	you	can	master	the	little	noise	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	,	but	it	's	not	 import 	 ant 	 	.
well	,	here	are	the	 curv 	 es 	 	for	it	.
now	,	i	get	to	the	final	thing	,	which	is	the	set	of	which	my	name	is	 attach 	 ed 	 	.
in	a	way	,	it	's	the	story	of	my	life	.
my	adolescence	was	 s 	 pent 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	german	occupation	of	france	.
since	i	thought	that	i	might	vanish	 with 	 in 	 	a	day	or	a	week	,	i	had	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 dream 	 s 	 	.
and	after	the	war	,	i	saw	an	uncle	 aga 	 in 	 	.
my	uncle	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	prominent	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	,	and	he	told	me	,	``	look	,	there	's	a	problem	which	i	could	not	solve	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	which	 no 	 body 	 	can	solve	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	construction	of	a	man	named	[	gaston	]	julia	and	[	pierre	]	fatou	.
if	you	could	find	 some 	 thing 	 	new	,	 any 	 thing 	 	,	you	will	get	your	 care 	 er 	 	made	.	``
so	i	 look 	 ed 	 	,	and	like	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	that	had	 tri 	 ed 	 	before	,	i	found	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
but	then	the	computer	came	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 app 	 ly 	 	the	computer	,	not	to	new	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	--	like	 th 	 is 	 	 wig 	 gle 	 	 wig 	 gle 	 	,	that	's	a	new	problem	--	but	to	old	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	i	went	from	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	real	 number 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 point 	 s 	 	on	a	line	,	to	 imagin 	 ary 	 	,	complex	 number 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 point 	 s 	 	on	a	plane	,	which	is	what	one	should	do	there	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	shape	came	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	shape	is	of	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 complic 	 ation 	 	.
the	 equ 	 ation 	 	is	 hid 	 den 	 	there	,	z	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	z	 square 	 d 	 	,	plus	c	.
it	's	so	simple	,	so	dry	.
it	's	so	 un 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
now	you	turn	the	crank	once	,	twice	:	twice	,	 marvel 	 s 	 	come	out	.
i	mean	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	.
i	do	n't	want	to	explain	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	.	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	.
 shape 	 s 	 	which	are	of	 s 	 uch 	 	 complic 	 ation 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 harmon 	 y 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	that	was	one	of	my	major	 discover 	 ies 	 	,	to	find	that	these	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	whole	big	thing	,	more	or	less	.
and	then	you	get	these	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 baro 	 que 	 	 decor 	 ations 	 	all	over	the	place	.
all	that	from	 th 	 is 	 	little	formula	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	,	five	 symbol 	 s 	 	in	it	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
the	color	was	 add 	 ed 	 	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 shape 	 s 	 	are	so	 complic 	 ated 	 	that	one	could	n't	make	any	sense	of	the	 number 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	plot	them	,	you	must	 choos 	 e 	 	some	system	.
and	so	my	principle	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	 al 	 ways 	 	present	the	 shape 	 s 	 	with	different	 color 	 ing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	some	 color 	 ing 	 s 	 	 emphas 	 ize 	 	that	,	and	 other 	 s 	 	it	is	that	or	that	.
it	's	so	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
in	1990	,	i	was	in	cambridge	,	u.k	.
to	 receiv 	 e 	 	a	prize	from	the	university	,	and	three	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	a	pilot	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	over	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	and	found	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
so	where	did	 th 	 is 	 	come	from	?
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	from	 extra 	 terrestrial 	 s 	 	.
well	,	so	the	 news 	 paper 	 	in	cambridge	 publish 	 ed 	 	an	article	about	that	``	 discover 	 y 	 	``	and	 receiv 	 ed 	 	the	next	day	5,000	 letter 	 s 	 	from	people	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	but	that	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	mandelbrot	set	 ver 	 y 	 	big	.	``
well	,	let	me	finish	.
 th 	 is 	 	shape	here	just	came	out	of	an	 exercis 	 e 	 	in	 pur 	 e 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
bottomless	 wonder 	 s 	 	spring	from	simple	 rule 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 repeat 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	end	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
