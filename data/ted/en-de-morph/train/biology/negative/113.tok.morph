but	in	non	-	professional	 circle 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	america	,	it	 arouse 	 s 	 	so	much	 hostil 	 ity 	 	--	--	that	it	's	fair	to	say	that	american	 biologist 	 s 	 	are	in	a	state	of	war	.
the	war	is	so	 worry 	 ing 	 	at	present	,	with	court	 case 	 s 	 	coming	up	in	one	state	after	 an 	 other 	 	,	that	i	felt	i	had	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
if	you	want	to	know	what	i	have	to	say	about	darwinism	 it 	 self 	 	,	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	you	're	going	to	have	to	look	at	my	 book 	 s 	 	,	which	you	wo	n't	find	in	the	 book 	 store 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	court	 case 	 s 	 	often	concern	an	 alle 	 ged 	 ly 	 	new	version	of	 creation 	 ism 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	intelligent	design	,	``	or	id	.
do	n't	be	 fool 	 ed 	 	.	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	new	about	id	.
it	's	just	 creation 	 ism 	 	under	 an 	 other 	 	name	,	 re 	 christen 	 ed 	 	--	i	 choos 	 e 	 	the	word	 advise 	 d 	 ly 	 	--	--	for	 tactic 	 al 	 	,	 politic 	 al 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.

there	is	an	effective	evolution	lobby	 coordi 	 nating 	 	the	fight	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	science	,	and	i	try	to	do	all	i	can	to	help	them	,	but	they	get	 quit 	 e 	 	 up 	 set 	 	when	people	like	me	 da 	 re 	 	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	we	happen	to	be	 atheist 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 evolution 	 ists 	 	.
they	see	us	 a 	 s 	 	 rock 	 ing 	 	the	boat	,	and	you	can	understand	why	.
 creation 	 ists 	 	,	 lack 	 ing 	 	any	 cohere 	 nt 	 	scientific	argument	for	 the 	 ir 	 	case	,	fall	back	on	the	popular	phobia	against	 a 	 theism 	 	.

in	fact	,	of	course	,	educated	 theo 	 log 	 ians 	 	from	the	 pop 	 e 	 	down	are	firm	in	 the 	 ir 	 	support	of	evolution	.
 th 	 is 	 	book	,	``	 find 	 ing 	 	darwin	's	god	,	``	by	kenneth	miller	,	is	one	of	the	most	effective	 attack 	 s 	 	on	intelligent	design	that	i	know	,	and	it	's	all	the	more	effective	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	written	by	a	 dev 	 out 	 	christian	.

people	like	me	,	on	the	other	hand	,	rock	the	boat	.
but	here	,	i	want	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	nice	about	 creation 	 ists 	 	.
it	's	not	a	thing	i	often	do	,	so	listen	 care 	 fully 	 	.
i	think	they	're	right	about	one	thing	.
i	think	they	're	right	that	evolution	is	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	to	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	individual	 evolution 	 ists 	 	,	like	the	 pop 	 e 	 	,	are	 al 	 so 	 	religious	,	but	i	think	they	're	 delud 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	a	true	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	darwinism	is	 deep 	 ly 	 	 corros 	 ive 	 	to	religious	faith	.
now	,	it	may	sound	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	about	to	preach	 a 	 theism 	 	,	and	i	want	to	 re 	 assure 	 	you	that	that	's	not	what	i	'm	going	to	do	.
in	an	audience	 a 	 s 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	that	would	be	 preach 	 ing 	 	to	the	choir	.
no	,	what	i	want	to	urge	 up 	 on 	 	you	--	--	 in 	 stead 	 	what	i	want	to	urge	 up 	 on 	 	you	is	militant	 a 	 theism 	 	.
but	that	's	 put 	 ting 	 	it	too	 negative 	 ly 	 	.
if	i	was	a	person	who	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	religious	faith	,	i	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	the	positive	power	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	science	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	science	 general 	 ly 	 	,	but	evolution	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	to	inspire	and	enthrall	,	 precise 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 atheist 	 ic 	 	.
now	,	the	difficult	problem	for	any	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	design	is	to	explain	the	massive	 statistic 	 al 	 	 im 	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	living	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 statistic 	 al 	 	 im 	 prob 	 ability 	 	in	the	direction	of	good	design	--	``	 complex 	 ity 	 	``	is	 an 	 other 	 	word	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	standard	 creation 	 ist 	 	argument	--	there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	;	they	all	 reduc 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	one	--	 take 	 s 	 	off	from	a	 statistic 	 al 	 	 im 	 prob 	 ability 	 	.
living	 creature 	 s 	 	are	too	complex	to	have	come	about	by	chance	;	 there 	 fore 	 	,	they	must	have	had	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	argument	of	course	,	 shoot 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	foot	.
any	 design 	 er 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 design 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	complex	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	even	more	complex	 him 	 self 	 	,	and	that	's	before	we	even	start	on	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	he	's	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	do	,	like	forgive	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	,	bless	 marriage 	 s 	 	,	listen	to	 pray 	 ers 	 	--	favor	our	side	in	a	war	--	--	 dis 	 ap 	 prove 	 	of	our	 s 	 ex 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
 complex 	 ity 	 	is	the	problem	that	any	 theor 	 y 	 	of	biology	 ha 	 s 	 	to	solve	,	and	you	ca	n't	solve	it	by	 post 	 ul 	 ating 	 	an	agent	that	is	even	more	complex	,	 there 	 by 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 com 	 pound 	 ing 	 	the	problem	.
darwinian	natural	 s 	 election 	 	is	so	 stunn 	 ing 	 ly 	 	elegant	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 solve 	 s 	 	the	problem	of	 explain 	 ing 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.

but	here	,	i	 on 	 ly 	 	want	to	make	the	point	that	the	 e 	 leg 	 ance 	 	of	darwinism	is	 corros 	 ive 	 	to	 relig 	 ion 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	so	elegant	,	so	 par 	 s 	 im 	 on 	 ious 	 	,	so	 power 	 ful 	 	,	so	 economic 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.

so	,	 return 	 ing 	 	to	 tactic 	 s 	 	and	the	evolution	lobby	,	i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	 rock 	 ing 	 	the	boat	may	be	just	the	right	thing	to	do	.
my	approach	to	 attack 	 ing 	 	 creation 	 ism 	 	is	 un 	 like 	 	the	evolution	lobby	.
my	approach	to	 attack 	 ing 	 	 creation 	 ism 	 	is	to	attack	 relig 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	,	and	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	i	need	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	the	 remark 	 able 	 	taboo	against	 s 	 peaking 	 	ill	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	do	so	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	the	late	douglas	adams	,	a	dear	friend	who	,	if	he	never	came	to	ted	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	.

in	practice	,	what	is	an	atheist	?
an	atheist	is	just	 some 	 body 	 	who	 feel 	 s 	 	about	yahweh	the	way	any	 de 	 cent 	 	christian	 feel 	 s 	 	about	thor	or	baal	or	the	 gold 	 en 	 	 ca 	 lf 	 	.

and	 how 	 ever 	 	we	define	 a 	 theism 	 	,	it	's	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	the	kind	of	academic	belief	that	a	person	is	 en 	 titled 	 	to	hold	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 vil 	 ified 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 un 	 patriot 	 ic 	 	,	 un 	 elect 	 able 	 	non	-	citizen	.

but	a	 re 	 cent 	 	article	by	paul	g.	bell	in	the	mensa	magazine	 provide 	 s 	 	some	 straw 	 s 	 	in	the	wind	.
mensa	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	is	an	 inter 	 national 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	for	people	with	 ver 	 y 	 	high	iq	.
and	from	a	meta	-	analysis	of	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	bell	 conclude 	 s 	 	that	,	i	quote	,	``	of	43	 stud 	 ies 	 	carried	out	since	1927	on	the	relationship	between	religious	belief	and	one	's	 intellig 	 ence 	 	or	 education 	 al 	 	level	,	all	but	four	found	an	 in 	 verse 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
that	is	,	the	 high 	 er 	 	one	's	 intellig 	 ence 	 	or	 education 	 al 	 	level	,	the	less	one	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	religious	.	``
well	,	i	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	the	original	42	 stud 	 ies 	 	and	i	ca	n't	comment	on	that	meta	-	anaysis	but	i	would	like	to	see	more	 stud 	 ies 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	lines	.
and	i	know	that	there	are	,	if	i	could	put	a	little	plug	here	,	there	are	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	 eas 	 ily 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 fin 	 anc 	 ing 	 	a	massive	research	survey	to	settle	the	question	,	and	i	put	the	 suggest 	 ion 	 	up	--	for	what	it	's	worth	.
but	let	me	know	show	you	some	data	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	and	 analyz 	 ed 	 	on	one	special	group	,	 name 	 ly 	 	,	top	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
in	1998	,	larson	and	witham	 poll 	 ed 	 	the	cream	of	american	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	who	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 honor 	 ed 	 	by	election	to	the	national	academy	of	 science 	 s 	 	,	and	among	 th 	 is 	 	select	group	,	belief	in	a	personal	god	 drop 	 ped 	 	to	a	 shatter 	 ing 	 	seven	percent	.
about	20	percent	are	agnostic	,	and	the	rest	could	 fair 	 ly 	 	be	 call 	 ed 	 	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
similar	 figure 	 s 	 	 obtain 	 ed 	 	for	belief	in	personal	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
among	 bio 	 logical 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	the	 figure 	 s 	 	are	even	lower	:	5.5	percent	,	 on 	 ly 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	in	god	.	physical	 scientist 	 s 	 	:	it	's	7.5	percent	.
i	've	not	 s 	 een 	 	 correspond 	 ing 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	for	elite	 scholar 	 s 	 	in	other	 field 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	or	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	but	i	'd	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	different	.
so	,	we	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	a	 grot 	 es 	 que 	 	 mis 	 match 	 	between	the	american	 intelligent 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	the	american	 elect 	 or 	 ate 	 	.
a	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	opinion	about	the	nature	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	which	is	held	by	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	top	american	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	 intelligent 	 s 	 ia 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	,	is	so	 abhor 	 rent 	 	to	the	american	 elect 	 or 	 ate 	 	that	no	 candid 	 ate 	 	for	popular	election	 da 	 re 	 	affirm	it	in	public	.
if	i	'm	right	,	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	high	 off 	 ice 	 	in	the	 great 	 est 	 	country	in	the	world	is	 bar 	 red 	 	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	people	best	 qual 	 ified 	 	to	hold	it	--	the	 intelligent 	 s 	 ia 	 	--	 un 	 less 	 	they	are	prepared	to	lie	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 belief 	 s 	 	.
to	put	it	 blunt 	 ly 	 	,	american	 politic 	 al 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	are	 heav 	 ily 	 	 load 	 ed 	 	against	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	intelligent	and	honest	.
i	'm	not	a	citizen	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	so	i	hope	it	wo	n't	be	thought	 un 	 be 	 coming 	 	if	i	suggest	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 hint 	 ed 	 	what	that	 some 	 thing 	 	is	.
from	what	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	of	ted	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	the	ideal	place	to	launch	it	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	fear	it	will	cost	money	.
we	need	a	 conscious 	 ness 	 	-	raising	,	coming	-	out	campaign	for	american	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	could	be	similar	to	the	campaign	 organize 	 d 	 	by	 homo 	 sexual 	 s 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	heaven	forbid	that	we	should	 st 	 oop 	 	to	public	 out 	 ing 	 	of	people	against	 the 	 ir 	 	will	.
in	most	 case 	 s 	 	,	people	who	out	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	will	help	to	destroy	the	myth	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	they	'll	 demonst 	 rate 	 	that	 atheist 	 s 	 	are	often	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	that	could	serve	 a 	 s 	 	 de 	 cent 	 	role	 model 	 s 	 	for	your	children	,	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	an	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	agent	could	use	to	recommend	a	product	,	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
there	should	be	a	 snow 	 ball 	 	effect	,	a	positive	 feed 	 back 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	the	more	 name 	 s 	 	we	have	,	the	more	we	get	.
there	could	be	non	-	linearities	,	threshold	 effect 	 s 	 	.
when	a	critical	mass	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 attain 	 ed 	 	,	there	's	an	abrupt	 accele 	 ration 	 	in	 recruit 	 ment 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	will	need	money	.
i	suspect	that	the	word	``	atheist	``	 it 	 self 	 	 contain 	 s 	 	or	 remain 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 tumbling 	 	block	far	out	of	proportion	to	what	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	and	a	 s 	 tumbling 	 	block	to	people	who	 other 	 wise 	 	might	be	happy	to	out	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	,	what	other	 word 	 s 	 	might	be	used	to	smooth	the	path	,	oil	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	,	sugar	the	pill	?	darwin	 him 	 self 	 	 prefer 	 red 	 	``	agnostic	``	--	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	out	of	 loyal 	 ty 	 	to	his	friend	huxley	,	who	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	the	term	.
darwin	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	an	atheist	in	the	same	sense	of	 den 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	a	god	.
i	think	that	 general 	 ly 	 	an	'	agnostic	'	would	be	the	most	correct	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	my	state	of	mind	.	``
he	even	 be 	 came 	 	 un 	 character 	 istically 	 	tetchy	with	edward	aveling	.
aveling	was	a	militant	atheist	who	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	darwin	to	accept	the	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	of	his	book	on	 a 	 theism 	 	--	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	giving	rise	to	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	myth	that	karl	marx	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	dedicate	``	das	kapital	``	to	darwin	,	which	he	did	n't	.	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	edward	aveling	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	aveling	's	 mi 	 stress 	 	was	marx	's	daughter	,	and	when	both	darwin	and	marx	 we 	 re 	 	dead	,	marx	's	 paper 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 muddle 	 d 	 	up	with	aveling	's	 paper 	 s 	 	and	a	letter	from	darwin	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	my	dear	 s 	 ir 	 	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	but	i	do	n't	want	you	to	dedicate	your	book	to	me	,	``	was	 mistak 	 en 	 ly 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 address 	 ed 	 	to	marx	,	and	that	 g 	 ave 	 	rise	to	 th 	 is 	 	whole	myth	,	which	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	.
it	's	a	sort	of	urban	myth	,	that	marx	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	dedicate	``	kapital	``	to	darwin	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	it	was	aveling	,	and	when	they	met	,	darwin	 challeng 	 ed 	 	aveling	,	``	why	do	you	call	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	 atheist 	 s 	 	?	``
``	'	agnostic	,	'	``	 re 	 tort 	 ed 	 	aveling	,	``	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	'	atheist	'	writ	 respect 	 able 	 	,	and	'	atheist	'	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	'	agnostic	'	writ	 aggress 	 ive 	 	.	``
darwin	 complain 	 ed 	 	,	``	but	why	should	you	be	so	 aggress 	 ive 	 	?	``
darwin	thought	that	 a 	 theism 	 	might	be	well	and	good	for	the	 intelligent 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	but	that	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	not	,	quote	,	``	 rip 	 e 	 	for	it	.	``
which	is	,	of	course	,	our	old	friend	,	the	``	do	n't	rock	the	boat	``	argument	.
it	's	not	 record 	 ed 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	aveling	told	darwin	to	come	down	off	his	high	horse	.
but	in	any	case	,	that	was	more	than	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
you	think	we	might	have	grown	up	since	then	.
now	,	a	friend	,	an	intelligent	 lapse 	 d 	 	jew	,	who	 incident 	 ally 	 	 observ 	 ed 	 	the	sabbath	for	 reason 	 s 	 	of	cultural	 solid 	 arity 	 	,	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	``	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	agnostic	.	``
he	wo	n't	call	 him 	 self 	 	an	atheist	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	,	in	principle	,	 im 	 possible 	 	to	prove	a	negative	,	but	agnostic	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	might	suggest	that	god	's	 exist 	 ence 	 	was	 there 	 fore 	 	on	equal	 term 	 s 	 	of	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	 a 	 s 	 	his	non	-	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
so	,	my	friend	is	 strict 	 ly 	 	agnostic	about	the	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	,	but	it	is	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	,	is	it	?	like	god	.
 h 	 ence 	 	the	phrase	,	``	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	agnostic	.	``
bertrand	russell	made	the	same	point	using	a	hypothetical	teapot	in	orbit	about	mars	.
you	would	 strict 	 ly 	 	have	to	be	agnostic	about	 whet 	 her 	 	there	is	a	teapot	in	orbit	about	mars	,	but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	you	treat	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	 a 	 s 	 	on	all	 four 	 s 	 	with	 it 	 s 	 	non	-	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
the	list	of	 thing 	 s 	 	which	we	 strict 	 ly 	 	have	to	be	agnostic	about	 do 	 es 	 	n't	stop	at	tooth	 fair 	 ies 	 	and	 teapot 	 s 	 	.	it	's	infinite	.
if	you	want	to	 believ 	 e 	 	one	 part 	 icular 	 	one	of	them	--	 uni 	 corn 	 s 	 	or	tooth	 fair 	 ies 	 	or	 teapot 	 s 	 	or	yahweh	--	the	 on 	 us 	 	is	on	you	to	say	why	.
the	 on 	 us 	 	is	not	on	the	rest	of	us	to	say	why	not	.
we	,	who	are	 atheist 	 s 	 	,	are	 al 	 so 	 	a	-	fairiests	and	a	-	teapotists	.
but	we	do	n't	 both 	 er 	 	to	say	so	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	my	friend	uses	``	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	agnostic	``	 a 	 s 	 	a	label	for	what	most	people	would	call	atheist	.
 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	if	we	want	to	attract	deep	down	 atheist 	 s 	 	to	come	out	 public 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	have	find	 some 	 thing 	 	better	to	stick	on	our	 bann 	 er 	 	than	``	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	``	or	``	teapot	agnostic	.	``
so	,	how	about	``	 human 	 ist 	 	``	?
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	advantage	of	a	 world 	 wide 	 	network	of	well	-	 organize 	 d 	 	 associ 	 ations 	 	and	 journal 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	in	place	.
my	problem	with	it	 on 	 ly 	 	is	 it 	 s 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 	 anthropo 	 cent 	 r 	 ism 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	darwin	is	that	the	human	species	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	among	 million 	 s 	 	of	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	some	close	,	some	 di 	 stant 	 	.
and	there	are	other	 possibil 	 ities 	 	like	``	 natural 	 ist 	 	,	``	but	that	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 fusion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	darwin	would	have	thought	 natural 	 ist 	 	--	``	 natural 	 ist 	 	``	 mean 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	``	 super 	 natural 	 ist 	 	``	--	and	it	is	used	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	--	darwin	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	by	the	other	sense	of	``	 natural 	 ist 	 	,	``	which	he	was	,	of	course	,	and	i	suppose	there	might	be	 other 	 s 	 	who	would	 con 	 fuse 	 	it	with	 nud 	 ism 	 	.
 s 	 uch 	 	people	might	be	 t 	 hose 	 	 belong 	 ing 	 	to	the	british	 ly 	 nch 	 	mob	which	last	year	 attack 	 ed 	 	a	 pediatric 	 ian 	 	in	 mistak 	 e 	 	for	a	 ped 	 oph 	 ile 	 	.
i	think	the	best	of	the	 avail 	 able 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	for	``	atheist	``	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	``	non	-	theist	.	``
it	 lack 	 s 	 	the	strong	 con 	 not 	 ation 	 	that	there	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	no	god	,	and	it	could	 there 	 fore 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	be	 embrace 	 d 	 	by	teapot	or	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	 agnostic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	compatible	with	the	god	of	the	 physicist 	 s 	 	.
when	 atheist 	 s 	 	like	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	and	albert	einstein	use	the	word	``	god	,	``	they	use	it	of	course	 a 	 s 	 	a	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	 short 	 hand 	 	for	that	deep	,	 myster 	 ious 	 	part	of	physics	which	we	do	n't	yet	understand	.
``	non	-	theist	``	will	do	for	all	that	,	yet	 un 	 like 	 	``	atheist	,	``	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	the	same	phobic	,	 hyster 	 ical 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	.
but	i	think	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 alter 	 native 	 	is	to	grasp	the	 nett 	 le 	 	of	the	word	``	 a 	 theism 	 	``	 it 	 self 	 	,	 precise 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	a	taboo	word	 carry 	 ing 	 	 fris 	 son 	 s 	 	of	 hyster 	 ical 	 	phobia	.
critical	mass	may	be	 hard 	 er 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	with	the	word	``	atheist	``	than	with	the	word	``	non	-	theist	,	``	or	some	other	non	-	confrontational	word	.
but	if	we	did	 achiev 	 e 	 	it	with	that	dread	word	--	``	atheist	``	 it 	 self 	 	--	the	 politic 	 al 	 	impact	would	be	even	 great 	 er 	 	.
now	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	religious	,	i	'd	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	evolution	.	i	'd	go	further	.
i	would	fear	science	in	general	if	 proper 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	scientific	 world 	 view 	 	is	so	much	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	more	 poet 	 ic 	 	,	more	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 she 	 er 	 	wonder	than	 any 	 thing 	 	in	the	poverty	-	stricken	 arsenal 	 s 	 	of	the	religious	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	carl	sagan	,	 an 	 other 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	dead	hero	,	put	it	,	``	how	is	it	that	 hard 	 ly 	 	any	major	 relig 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	science	and	 conclude 	 d 	 	,	'	 th 	 is 	 	is	better	than	we	thought	!
