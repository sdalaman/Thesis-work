some	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	and	 develop 	 ments 	 	in	the	world	often	happen	at	the	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	two	 field 	 s 	 	.
so	 to 	 night 	 	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	about	the	 intersect 	 ion 	 	that	i	'm	most	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	at	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	moment	,	which	is	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	 robotic 	 s 	 	.
so	if	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 robot 	 s 	 	that	can	be	more	 express 	 ive 	 	and	that	can	connect	better	with	us	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	look	to	some	of	the	human	 professional 	 s 	 	of	artificial	emotion	and	 personal 	 ity 	 	that	occur	in	the	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 art 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	creating	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	the	 art 	 s 	 	and	to	attract	people	to	science	and	technology	.
some	people	in	the	last	decade	or	two	have	 start 	 ed 	 	creating	 art 	 work 	 	with	technology	.
with	my	new	venture	,	marilyn	monrobot	,	i	would	like	to	use	art	to	create	tech	.
so	we	're	based	in	new	york	city	.
and	if	you	're	a	 perform 	 er 	 	that	 want 	 s 	 	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	with	an	 ador 	 able 	 	robot	,	or	if	you	have	a	robot	that	 need 	 s 	 	 entertain 	 ment 	 	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	contact	me	,	the	bot	-	agent	.
the	bot	,	our	 ris 	 ing 	 	 celebr 	 ity 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	his	own	twitter	account	:	@	 robot 	 in 	 the 	 wild 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	one	of	our	first	 robot 	 s 	 	,	data	.
he	's	named	after	the	star	trek	character	.
i	think	he	's	going	to	be	super	popular	.
we	've	got	the	robot	--	in	his	head	is	a	 data 	 base 	 	of	a	lot	of	 joke 	 s 	 	.
now	each	of	these	 joke 	 s 	 	is	 label 	 ed 	 	with	certain	 attribut 	 es 	 	.
so	it	 know 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	subject	;	it	 know 	 s 	 	about	the	length	.
it	 know 	 s 	 	how	much	it	's	moving	.
and	so	it	's	going	to	try	to	watch	your	 respons 	 e 	 	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	no	idea	what	my	robot	is	going	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	can	 al 	 so 	 	learn	from	you	about	the	quality	of	 it 	 s 	 	 joke 	 s 	 	and	cater	 thing 	 s 	 	,	sort	of	like	netflix	-	style	,	over	 long 	 er 	 	-	term	to	different	 commun 	 ities 	 	or	 audience 	 s 	 	,	children	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	different	 culture 	 s 	 	.
you	can	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	from	the	robot	about	the	community	that	you	're	in	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	i	can	use	each	one	of	you	 a 	 s 	 	the	 act 	 ing 	 	coach	to	our	future	robot	 companion 	 s 	 	.
some	of	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	middle	section	--	you	have	red	/	green	 padd 	 les 	 	.
if	you	like	what	's	going	on	,	show	the	green	.
if	you	do	n't	like	the	subject	or	the	performance	,	you	can	hold	the	red	.
now	do	n't	be	 s 	 hy 	 	.
it	's	just	a	robot	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	...	yet	.
and	the	rest	of	you	,	you	still	count	,	you	still	matter	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 micro 	 phone 	 	that	's	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	laughter	and	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	and	 boo 	 ing 	 	--	i	hope	not	--	to	help	make	some	of	 it 	 s 	 	next	 decision 	 s 	 	.
right	,	so	,	let	the	robot	stand	-	up	 come 	 dy 	 	begin	.
data	:	 hell 	 o 	 	tedwomen	.
it	's	an	honor	to	be	here	.
you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	looking	good	out	there	.

``	how	can	the	news	possibly	be	 wo 	 rse 	 	?	``
``	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	contact	you	since	 yester 	 day 	 	.	``

you	get	past	me	,	the	guy	 be 	 hind 	 	me	 ha 	 s 	 	a	spoon	.	``
hk	:	he	's	a	french	robot	.
data	:	a	couple	of	new	jersey	 hunter 	 s 	 	are	out	in	the	 wood 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	 fall 	 s 	 	to	the	ground	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	not	seem	to	be	 breath 	 ing 	 	.
the	other	guy	 whip 	 s 	 	out	his	cell	phone	and	 call 	 s 	 	911	.
he	 gasp 	 s 	 	to	the	 oper 	 ator 	 	,	``	my	friend	is	dead	.
what	can	i	do	?	``
the	 oper 	 ator 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	just	take	it	easy	.
i	can	help	.
first	,	let	's	make	 s 	 ure 	 	he	's	dead	.	``
there	is	a	silence	,	and	the	 oper 	 ator 	 	 hear 	 s 	 	a	shot	.
the	guy	's	voice	 come 	 s 	 	back	on	the	line	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	what	?	``
question	:	why	is	 tele 	 vision 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	medium	?
 any 	 one 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 n 	 either 	 	rare	nor	well	 d 	 one 	 	.
but	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	honest	with	you	,	i	kind	of	love	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
