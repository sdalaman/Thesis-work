about	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	went	to	visit	a	friend	in	hong	kong	.
and	at	the	time	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 super 	 stit 	 ious 	 	.
so	,	 up 	 on 	 	 land 	 ing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	still	at	the	old	hong	kong	 air 	 port 	 	that	's	kai	tak	,	when	it	was	 s 	 mack 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	city	--	i	thought	,	``	if	i	see	 some 	 thing 	 	good	,	i	'm	going	to	have	a	great	time	here	in	my	two	 week 	 s 	 	.	and	if	i	see	 some 	 thing 	 	negative	,	i	'm	going	to	be	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.	``
so	the	plane	 land 	 ed 	 	in	between	the	 building 	 s 	 	and	got	to	a	full	stop	in	front	of	 th 	 is 	 	little	 bill 	 board 	 	.
and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	to	see	some	of	the	design	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	hong	kong	in	my	stay	there	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	--	i	just	went	to	see	,	you	know	,	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	in	hong	kong	.
but	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	with	a	great	job	 off 	 er 	 	.
and	i	flew	back	to	austria	,	 pack 	 ed 	 	my	 bag 	 s 	 	,	and	,	 an 	 other 	 	week	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	was	 aga 	 in 	 	on	my	way	to	hong	kong	still	 super 	 stit 	 ions 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	,	if	that	'	winner	'	 bill 	 board 	 	is	still	up	,	i	'm	going	to	have	a	good	time	 work 	 ing 	 	here	.
but	if	it	's	gone	,	it	's	going	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	and	 stress 	 ful 	 	.	``
so	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	was	the	 bill 	 board 	 	still	up	but	they	had	put	 th 	 is 	 	one	right	next	to	it	.
on	the	other	hand	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	taught	me	where	 super 	 st 	 ition 	 	 get 	 s 	 	me	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	had	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	time	in	hong	kong	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	did	have	a	number	of	real	 moment 	 s 	 	of	happiness	in	my	life	--	of	,	you	know	,	i	think	what	the	 con 	 ference 	 	brochure	 refer 	 s 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	``	 moment 	 s 	 	that	take	your	breath	away	.	``
and	since	i	'm	a	big	list	maker	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 list 	 ed 	 	them	all	.
now	,	you	do	n't	have	to	go	through	the	trouble	of	 read 	 ing 	 	them	and	i	wo	n't	read	them	for	you	.
i	know	that	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	to	hear	about	other	people	's	 happiness 	 es 	 	.
what	i	did	do	,	 th 	 ough 	 	is	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	them	from	a	design	 stand 	 point 	 	and	just	 eliminate 	 d 	 	all	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	design	.
and	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	over	half	of	them	had	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	design	.
so	there	are	,	of	course	,	two	different	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
there	's	one	from	a	consumer	's	point	of	view	--	where	i	was	happy	while	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	design	.
and	i	'll	just	give	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	i	had	gotten	my	first	walkman	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	1983	.
my	brother	had	 th 	 is 	 	great	yamaha	 motor 	 cycle 	 	that	he	was	 will 	 ing 	 	to	borrow	to	me	 free 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	police	's	``	 synchron 	 icity 	 	``	cassette	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	released	and	there	was	no	helmet	law	in	my	 home 	 town 	 	of	bregenz	.
so	you	could	drive	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	blasting	the	police	on	the	new	sony	walkman	.
and	i	remember	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	true	moment	of	happiness	.
you	know	,	of	course	,	they	are	related	to	 th 	 is 	 	combination	of	at	 l 	 east 	 	two	of	them	 be 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	design	 object 	 s 	 	.
and	,	you	know	,	there	's	a	scale	of	happiness	when	you	talk	about	in	design	but	the	 motor 	 cycle 	 	incident	would	 definite 	 ly 	 	be	,	you	know	,	 situ 	 ated 	 	 some 	 where 	 	here	--	right	in	there	between	 de 	 light 	 	and	 bli 	 s 	 s 	 	.
now	,	there	is	the	other	part	,	from	a	 design 	 er 	 	's	 stand 	 point 	 	--	if	you	're	happy	while	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	one	way	to	see	how	happy	 design 	 ers 	 	are	when	they	're	 design 	 ing 	 	could	be	to	look	at	the	 author 	 s 	 	'	 photo 	 s 	 	on	the	back	of	 the 	 ir 	 	monographs	?
so	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	australians	and	the	japanese	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	mexicans	are	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	.
while	,	 some 	 what 	 	,	the	spaniards	...
and	,	i	think	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	,	the	swiss	,	do	n't	seem	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	all	that	well	.
last	november	,	a	museum	 open 	 ed 	 	in	tokyo	 call 	 ed 	 	the	mori	museum	,	in	a	 sky 	 scrap 	 er 	 	,	up	on	the	56th	floor	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 inaugu 	 ral 	 	exhibit	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	happiness	.	``
and	i	went	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 eager 	 ly 	 	,	to	see	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	--	well	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	with	an	eye	on	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	.
and	they	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	sectioned	the	exhibit	off	 in 	 to 	 	four	different	 area 	 s 	 	.
under	``	arcadia	,	``	they	 show 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	from	the	edo	period	--	a	hundred	ways	to	write	``	happiness	``	in	different	 form 	 s 	 	.
or	they	had	 th 	 is 	 	apple	by	yoko	ono	--	that	,	of	course	,	 lat 	 er 	 	on	was	,	you	know	,	made	 in 	 to 	 	the	label	for	the	beatles	.
under	``	nirvana	``	they	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	constable	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
and	there	was	a	little	--	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	about	 abstract 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	blue	field	--	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	yves	klein	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	 theor 	 y 	 	was	that	if	you	abstract	an	image	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	,	you	know	open	 a 	 s 	 	much	room	for	the	un	-	representable	--	and	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	you	know	,	are	able	to	involve	the	 view 	 er 	 	more	.
then	,	under	``	 desir 	 e 	 	,	``	they	 show 	 ed 	 	these	shunsho	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	 al 	 so 	 	from	the	edo	period	--	ink	on	silk	.
and	,	 last 	 ly 	 	,	under	``	 harmon 	 y 	 	,	``	they	had	 th 	 is 	 	13th	-	century	mandala	from	tibet	.
now	,	what	i	took	away	from	the	exhibit	was	that	 may 	 be 	 	with	the	exception	of	the	mandala	most	of	the	 piece 	 s 	 	in	there	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	the	 visual 	 ization 	 	of	happiness	and	not	about	happiness	.
and	i	felt	a	little	bit	 cheat 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 visual 	 ization 	 	--	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	thing	to	do	.
and	,	you	know	,	my	studio	--	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	all	the	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	you	know	,	a	book	.
a	happy	dog	--	and	you	take	it	out	,	it	's	an	 aggress 	 ive 	 	dog	.
it	's	a	happy	david	byrne	and	an	 ang 	 ry 	 	david	byrne	.
or	a	jazz	 post 	 er 	 	with	a	happy	face	and	a	more	 aggress 	 ive 	 	face	.
you	know	,	that	's	not	a	big	deal	to	accomplish	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	to	the	point	where	,	you	know	,	 with 	 in 	 	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	or	 with 	 in 	 	the	movie	industry	,	``	happy	``	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	 s 	 uch 	 	a	bad	reputation	that	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	the	subject	and	still	appear	authentic	,	you	 al 	 most 	 	would	have	to	,	you	know	,	do	it	from	a	 cynic 	 al 	 	point	of	view	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	you	know	,	the	movie	 post 	 er 	 	.
or	we	,	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	designed	a	box	set	for	the	 talk 	 ing 	 	 head 	 s 	 	where	the	happiness	 visual 	 ized 	 	on	the	cover	 definite 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	a	dark	side	to	it	.
much	,	much	more	difficult	is	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	the	 design 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	evoke	happiness	--	and	i	'm	going	to	just	show	you	three	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	 th 	 is 	 	for	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	campaign	 d 	 one 	 	by	a	young	artist	in	new	york	,	who	 call 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	``	true	.	``
 every 	 body 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	ridden	the	new	york	 sub 	 way 	 	system	will	be	familiar	with	these	 sign 	 s 	 	?
true	 print 	 ed 	 	his	own	version	of	these	 sign 	 s 	 	.
met	every	wednesday	at	a	 sub 	 way 	 	stop	with	20	of	his	 friend 	 s 	 	.
they	 divid 	 ed 	 	up	the	different	 sub 	 way 	 	lines	and	 add 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	version	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	.
now	,	the	way	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	in	the	system	is	that	 no 	 body 	 	ever	 look 	 s 	 	at	these	 sign 	 s 	 	.
so	you	're	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	in	the	 sub 	 way 	 	,	and	you	kind	of	 star 	 e 	 	at	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	it	 take 	 s 	 	you	a	while	 un 	 til 	 	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 say 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	different	than	what	it	 normal 	 ly 	 	 say 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	that	's	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	how	it	made	me	happy	.
now	,	true	is	a	real	 human 	 itarian 	 	.
he	did	n't	want	any	of	his	 friend 	 s 	 	to	be	 arrest 	 ed 	 	,	so	he	 suppli 	 ed 	 	 every 	 body 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	fake	volunteer	card	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fake	letter	from	the	mta	to	 every 	 body 	 	--	sort	of	like	 pretend 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	an	art	project	 finance 	 d 	 	by	the	 metro 	 politan 	 	transit	 author 	 ity 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	new	york	project	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	at	p.s	.	1	--	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	square	room	by	james	turrell	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	retractable	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
 open 	 s 	 	up	at	 du 	 s 	 k 	 	and	dawn	every	day	.
you	do	n't	see	the	horizon	.
you	're	just	in	there	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	 in 	 credible 	 	,	subtle	 change 	 s 	 	of	color	in	the	sky	.
and	the	room	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	.
people	's	demeanor	 change 	 s 	 	when	they	go	in	there	.
and	,	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	i	have	n't	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	sky	in	the	same	way	after	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	an	hour	in	there	.
there	are	,	of	course	,	more	than	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 project 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	here	.
i	would	 definite 	 ly 	 	say	that	 observ 	 ing 	 	vik	muniz	'	``	cloud	``	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	manhattan	for	 s 	 ure 	 	made	me	happy	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	my	last	project	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	from	a	young	 design 	 er 	 	in	new	york	.
he	's	from	korea	 original 	 ly 	 	.
and	he	took	it	 up 	 on 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	print	55,000	speech	 bubble 	 s 	 	--	empty	speech	 bubble 	 s 	 	 stick 	 ers 	 	,	large	 one 	 s 	 	and	small	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 go 	 es 	 	around	new	york	and	just	 put 	 s 	 	them	,	empty	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	,	on	 post 	 ers 	 	.
and	other	people	go	and	fill	them	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	let	me	die	in	peace	.	``
i	think	that	was	--	the	most	surprising	to	 my 	 self 	 	was	that	the	writing	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	so	good	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	on	a	 music 	 ian 	 	 post 	 er 	 	,	that	 say 	 s 	 	:	``	i	am	 concern 	 ed 	 	that	my	cd	will	not	sell	more	than	200,000	 unit 	 s 	 	and	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	my	recoupable	advance	from	my	label	will	be	taken	from	me	,	after	which	,	my	contract	will	be	cancelled	,	and	i	'll	be	back	 do 	 ing 	 	journey	 cover 	 s 	 	on	bleecker	street	.	``
i	think	the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	so	well	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	 win 	 s 	 	.
jee	 get 	 s 	 	to	have	his	project	;	the	public	 get 	 s 	 	a	 sweet 	 er 	 	environment	;	and	different	public	 get 	 s 	 	a	place	to	express	 it 	 self 	 	;	and	the	 advertise 	 rs 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	get	 some 	 body 	 	to	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	.
well	,	there	was	a	question	,	of	course	,	that	was	on	my	mind	for	a	while	:	you	know	,	can	i	do	more	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	like	 do 	 ing 	 	in	design	and	less	of	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	i	do	n't	like	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	?
which	 br 	 ought 	 	me	back	to	my	list	making	--	you	know	,	just	to	see	what	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	about	my	job	.
you	know	,	one	is	:	just	 work 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	pressure	.
then	:	 work 	 ing 	 	 concent 	 rated 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	frazzled	.
or	,	 a 	 s 	 	nancy	 s 	 aid 	 	before	,	like	 re 	 ally 	 	 immers 	 e 	 	 one 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
try	not	to	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	--	or	try	not	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	computer	all	day	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	you	know	,	related	to	it	:	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	the	studio	.
then	,	of	course	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	,	you	know	,	work	on	 thing 	 s 	 	where	the	content	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	me	.
and	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	enjoy	the	end	 result 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	found	 an 	 other 	 	list	in	one	of	my	diaries	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 contain 	 ed 	 	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	thought	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	my	life	so	far	.
and	,	just	about	at	that	time	,	an	austrian	magazine	 call 	 ed 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	if	we	would	want	to	do	six	 spread 	 s 	 	--	design	six	 spread 	 s 	 	that	work	like	 divid 	 ing 	 	 page 	 s 	 	between	the	different	 chapter 	 s 	 	in	the	magazine	?
and	the	whole	thing	just	fell	together	.
so	i	just	 pick 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	thought	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	``	 every 	 thing 	 	i	do	 al 	 ways 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	me	``	--	and	we	made	these	 spread 	 s 	 	right	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	it	was	:	``	 every 	 thing 	 	i	do	 al 	 ways 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	me	.	``
a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	french	company	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	design	five	 bill 	 board 	 s 	 	for	them	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	could	supply	the	content	for	it	.
so	i	just	 pick 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	flew	to	arizona	--	the	 design 	 er 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	with	me	,	and	 my 	 self 	 	--	and	 photograph 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
so	it	's	:	``	 try 	 ing 	 	to	look	good	 limit 	 s 	 	my	life	.	``
and	then	we	did	one	more	of	these	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	for	a	magazine	,	 divid 	 ing 	 	 page 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	:	``	 hav 	 ing 	 	``	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	thing	;	it	's	just	,	you	know	,	 photograph 	 ed 	 	from	the	side	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	the	front	.
then	it	's	:	``	 gut 	 s 	 	.	``
 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	the	same	thing	--	``	 gut 	 s 	 	``	is	just	the	same	room	,	 re 	 work 	 ed 	 	.
then	it	's	:	``	 al 	 ways 	 	 work 	 s 	 	out	.	``
then	it	's	``	for	,	``	with	the	light	on	.
and	it	's	``	me	.	``
thank	you	so	much	.
