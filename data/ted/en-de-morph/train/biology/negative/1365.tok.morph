gabriel	garcía	márquez	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	,	for	his	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	but	even	more	,	i	think	,	for	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	of	his	 pro 	 s 	 e 	 	.
and	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	the	 open 	 ing 	 	line	from	``	one	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 ol 	 itude 	 	``	or	the	 fantastic 	 al 	 	stream	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	in	``	 aut 	 umn 	 	of	the	patriarch	,	``	where	the	 word 	 s 	 	rush	by	,	page	after	page	of	unpunctuated	 image 	 ry 	 	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	the	 read 	 er 	 	 a 	 long 	 	like	some	wild	river	 twist 	 ing 	 	through	a	 prim 	 al 	 	south	american	jungle	,	 read 	 ing 	 	márquez	is	a	visceral	experience	.
which	 s 	 truck 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	one	session	with	the	novel	when	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 wept 	 	 a 	 long 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	,	 vivi 	 d 	 	journey	in	 transl 	 ation 	 	.
now	i	was	a	 compar 	 ative 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	major	in	college	,	which	is	like	an	english	major	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	chaucer	for	three	 month 	 s 	 	,	we	got	to	read	great	 liter 	 ature 	 	in	 transl 	 ation 	 	from	around	the	world	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	great	 a 	 s 	 	these	 book 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	you	could	 al 	 ways 	 	tell	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	close	to	the	full	effect	.
but	not	so	with	márquez	who	once	 praise 	 d 	 	his	 transl 	 ator 	 	's	 version 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	better	than	his	own	,	which	is	an	 astonish 	 ing 	 	compliment	.
so	when	i	heard	that	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	,	gregory	rabassa	,	had	written	his	own	book	on	the	subject	,	i	could	n't	wait	to	read	it	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	apropos	of	the	italian	 ad 	 age 	 	that	i	 lift 	 ed 	 	from	his	forward	,	``	if	 th 	 is 	 	be	 t 	 reason 	 	.	``
and	it	's	a	 charm 	 ing 	 	read	.
it	's	 high 	 ly 	 	 recommend 	 ed 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	's	art	.
but	the	reason	that	i	 ment 	 ion 	 	it	is	that	early	on	,	rabassa	 off 	 ers 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 elegant 	 ly 	 	simple	 in 	 sight 	 	:	``	every	act	of	communication	is	an	act	of	 transl 	 ation 	 	.	``
now	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	obvious	to	all	of	you	for	a	long	time	,	but	for	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	often	 a 	 s 	 	i	'd	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	that	exact	 difficult 	 y 	 	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	,	i	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	the	inherent	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	communication	in	so	 crystall 	 ine 	 	a	light	.
ever	since	i	can	remember	 think 	 ing 	 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	about	 s 	 uch 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	communication	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	my	central	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
even	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	i	remember	 think 	 ing 	 	that	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	most	in	life	was	to	be	able	to	understand	 every 	 thing 	 	and	then	to	communicate	it	to	 every 	 one 	 	else	.
so	no	ego	 problem 	 s 	 	.
it	's	funny	,	my	wife	,	 dai 	 s 	 y 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	family	is	 litter 	 ed 	 	with	 schizophrenic 	 s 	 	--	and	i	mean	 litter 	 ed 	 	with	them	--	once	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	chris	,	i	 al 	 ready 	 	have	a	brother	who	 think 	 s 	 	he	's	god	.
i	do	n't	need	a	husband	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	.	``
 any 	 way 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 plunge 	 d 	 	through	my	20s	ever	more	aware	of	how	 un 	 obtain 	 able 	 	the	first	part	of	my	 child 	 hood 	 	 ambit 	 ion 	 	was	,	it	was	that	second	part	,	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 success 	 fully 	 	communicate	to	 other 	 s 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	knowledge	i	was	 gain 	 ing 	 	,	where	the	 f 	 util 	 ity 	 	of	my	quest	 re 	 ally 	 	set	in	.
time	after	time	,	 when 	 ever 	 	i	set	out	to	share	some	great	truth	with	a	soon	-	to	-	be	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	recipient	,	it	had	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	effect	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	when	your	 open 	 ing 	 	line	of	communication	is	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	listen	up	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	about	to	drop	some	serious	knowledge	on	you	,	``	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	you	'll	discover	both	ice	and	the	 fir 	 ing 	 	 s 	 quad 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	after	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	 alien 	 ating 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 strange 	 rs 	 	 a 	 like 	 	,	i	 final 	 ly 	 	got	it	,	a	new	personal	truth	all	my	own	,	that	if	i	was	going	to	ever	communicate	well	with	other	people	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 gain 	 ing 	 	,	i	'd	better	find	a	different	way	of	going	about	it	.
and	that	's	when	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	 come 	 dy 	 	.
now	 come 	 dy 	 	 travel 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	a	distinct	 wave 	 length 	 	from	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	language	.
if	i	had	to	place	it	on	an	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	spectrum	,	i	'd	say	it	 fall 	 s 	 	 some 	 where 	 	between	 poet 	 ry 	 	and	lies	.
and	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	all	 come 	 dy 	 	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	humor	that	 color 	 s 	 	 safe 	 ly 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	lines	of	what	we	 al 	 ready 	 	think	and	feel	.
what	i	want	to	talk	about	is	the	 un 	 ique 	 	ability	that	the	best	 come 	 dy 	 	and	 sati 	 re 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	at	circumventing	our	 ing 	 rain 	 ed 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	--	 come 	 dy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 philosoph 	 er 	 	's	stone	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	the	base	metal	of	our	 convention 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	 transform 	 s 	 	it	through	 ridicul 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	different	way	of	 see 	 ing 	 	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	i	take	from	the	theme	of	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	:	 gain 	 ed 	 	in	 transl 	 ation 	 	.
that	it	's	about	communication	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	produce	 great 	 er 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	individual	,	but	 lead 	 s 	 	to	real	change	.
which	in	my	experience	 mean 	 s 	 	communication	that	 manage 	 s 	 	to	speak	to	and	expand	our	 con 	 cept 	 	of	self	-	interest	.
now	i	'm	big	on	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	people	's	self	-	interest	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	all	wired	for	that	.
it	's	part	of	our	 surviv 	 al 	 	package	,	and	that	's	why	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	so	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	,	and	that	's	why	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	at	that	level	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	our	own	self	-	interest	,	we	 final 	 ly 	 	begin	to	grasp	our	ability	to	respond	,	our	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	the	rest	of	the	world	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	i	mean	by	the	best	 come 	 dy 	 	and	 sati 	 re 	 	,	i	mean	work	that	 come 	 s 	 	first	and	 fore 	 most 	 	from	a	place	of	 honest 	 y 	 	and	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	.
now	if	you	think	back	on	tina	fey	's	impersonations	on	saturday	night	live	of	the	 new 	 ly 	 	 nominate 	 d 	 	vice	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 candid 	 ate 	 	sarah	palin	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	.
fey	 demonst 	 rated 	 	far	more	 effective 	 ly 	 	than	any	 politic 	 al 	 	pundit	the	 candid 	 ate 	 	's	fundamental	lack	of	 serious 	 ness 	 	,	cementing	an	impression	that	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	american	public	still	 hold 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	the	key	detail	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	fey	's	 script 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	written	by	her	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	written	by	the	snl	 writer 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 lift 	 ed 	 	verbatim	from	palin	's	own	 remark 	 s 	 	.
here	was	a	palin	impersonator	 quo 	 ting 	 	palin	word	for	word	.
now	that	's	 honest 	 y 	 	and	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	,	and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	why	fey	's	 performance 	 s 	 	left	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 last 	 ing 	 	impression	.
on	the	other	side	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	spectrum	,	the	first	time	that	i	heard	rush	limbaugh	refer	to	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 hope 	 ful 	 	john	edwards	 a 	 s 	 	the	breck	girl	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	he	'd	made	a	direct	hit	.
now	it	's	not	often	that	i	'm	going	to	associate	the	 word 	 s 	 	 honest 	 y 	 	and	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	with	limbaugh	,	but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	 argu 	 e 	 	with	that	 punch 	 line 	 	.
the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	edwards	'	personal	 van 	 ity 	 	.
and	guess	what	?
that	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	the	exact	 personal 	 ity 	 	trait	that	was	at	the	core	of	the	scandal	that	 end 	 ed 	 	his	 politic 	 al 	 	 care 	 er 	 	.
now	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	show	with	john	stewart	is	by	far	the	most	--	it	's	by	far	the	most	well	-	 document 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	 effective 	 ness 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 come 	 dy 	 	.
survey	after	survey	,	from	pew	research	to	the	annenberg	center	for	public	policy	,	 ha 	 s 	 	found	that	 dai 	 ly 	 	show	 view 	 ers 	 	are	better	 inform 	 ed 	 	about	current	 event 	 s 	 	than	the	 view 	 ers 	 	of	all	major	network	and	cable	news	 show 	 s 	 	.
now	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 say 	 s 	 	more	about	the	conflict	between	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	and	 profit 	 ability 	 	of	corporate	 journal 	 ism 	 	than	it	 do 	 es 	 	about	the	 attentive 	 ness 	 	of	stewart	's	 view 	 ers 	 	,	the	 large 	 r 	 	point	 remain 	 s 	 	that	stewart	's	material	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 ground 	 ed 	 	in	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	the	 fact 	 s 	 	--	not	 be 	 cause 	 	his	intent	is	to	inform	.	it	's	not	.
his	intent	is	to	be	funny	.
it	just	so	 happen 	 s 	 	that	stewart	's	brand	of	funny	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 un 	 less 	 	the	 fact 	 s 	 	are	true	.
and	the	result	is	great	 come 	 dy 	 	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	information	 deliver 	 y 	 	system	that	 score 	 s 	 	 mark 	 ed 	 ly 	 	 high 	 er 	 	in	both	 cr 	 ed 	 ibility 	 	and	 re 	 tent 	 ion 	 	than	the	professional	news	media	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 doub 	 ly 	 	 iron 	 ic 	 	when	you	consider	that	what	 give 	 s 	 	 come 	 dy 	 	 it 	 s 	 	edge	at	 reach 	 ing 	 	around	people	's	 wall 	 s 	 	is	the	way	that	it	uses	 de 	 liberate 	 	 mis 	 direction 	 	.
a	great	piece	of	 come 	 dy 	 	is	a	verbal	magic	trick	,	where	you	think	it	's	going	over	here	and	then	all	of	a	sudden	you	're	 transport 	 ed 	 	over	here	.
and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	mental	 de 	 light 	 	that	's	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	the	physical	 respons 	 e 	 	of	laughter	,	which	,	not	 co 	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	endorphins	in	the	brain	.
and	just	like	that	,	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 seduce 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	different	way	of	looking	at	 some 	 thing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	endorphins	have	 br 	 ought 	 	down	your	 defense 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	exact	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	the	way	that	anger	and	fear	and	panic	,	all	of	the	flight	-	or	-	fight	 respons 	 es 	 	,	 oper 	 ate 	 	.
flight	-	or	-	fight	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	adrenalin	,	which	 throw 	 s 	 	our	 wall 	 s 	 	up	sky	-	high	.
and	the	 come 	 dy 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	a	lot	of	the	same	 area 	 s 	 	where	our	 defense 	 s 	 	are	the	 strong 	 est 	 	--	race	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 sexual 	 ity 	 	--	 on 	 ly 	 	by	 approach 	 ing 	 	them	through	humor	 in 	 stead 	 	of	adrenalin	,	we	get	endorphins	and	the	alchemy	of	laughter	 turn 	 s 	 	our	 wall 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 window 	 s 	 	,	 reveal 	 ing 	 	a	fresh	and	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	point	of	view	.
now	let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	my	act	.
i	have	some	material	about	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	radical	 ga 	 y 	 	agenda	,	which	 start 	 s 	 	off	by	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	how	radical	is	the	 ga 	 y 	 	agenda	?
 be 	 cause 	 	from	what	i	can	tell	,	the	three	 thing 	 s 	 	 ga 	 y 	 	americans	seem	to	want	most	are	to	join	the	 militar 	 y 	 	,	get	married	and	start	a	family	.

have	at	it	you	radical	 bastard 	 s 	 	.	the	field	is	 your 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	these	lines	about	 ga 	 y 	 	 adopt 	 ion 	 	:	what	is	the	problem	with	 ga 	 y 	 	 adopt 	 ion 	 	?
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 remote 	 ly 	 	controversial	?
if	you	have	a	baby	and	you	think	that	baby	's	 ga 	 y 	 	,	you	should	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	put	it	up	for	 adopt 	 ion 	 	.

 mis 	 direction 	 	is	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	trick	that	 come 	 dy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	up	 it 	 s 	 	sleeve	.
 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	language	is	 an 	 other 	 	real	strong	suit	of	great	 come 	 dy 	 	.
there	are	few	 phrase 	 s 	 	that	pack	a	more	 concent 	 rated 	 	dose	of	subject	and	symbol	than	the	perfect	 punch 	 line 	 	.

not	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	what	it	 reveal 	 s 	 	about	the	adult	who	's	 s 	 peaking 	 	them	.
and	one	last	 power 	 ful 	 	 attribut 	 e 	 	that	 come 	 dy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	communication	is	that	it	's	 inherent 	 ly 	 	viral	.
people	ca	n't	wait	to	pass	 a 	 long 	 	that	new	great	joke	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	some	new	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	our	wired	world	.
 come 	 dy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	country	with	 remark 	 able 	 	speed	way	before	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	social	media	,	even	cable	tv	.
back	in	1980	when	comedian	richard	pryor	 accident 	 ally 	 	set	 him 	 self 	 	on	fire	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	freebasing	accident	,	i	was	in	los	angeles	the	day	after	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	and	then	i	was	in	washington	d.c.	two	 day 	 s 	 	after	that	.
and	i	heard	the	exact	same	 punch 	 line 	 	on	both	 coast 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	ignited	negro	college	fund	.
 clear 	 ly 	 	,	it	did	n't	come	out	of	a	 to 	 night 	 	show	monologue	.
and	my	guess	here	--	and	i	have	no	research	on	 th 	 is 	 	--	is	that	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	to	look	back	at	it	and	if	you	could	research	it	,	you	'd	find	out	that	 come 	 dy 	 	is	the	second	 old 	 est 	 	viral	profession	.
first	there	 we 	 re 	 	 drum 	 s 	 	and	then	knock	-	knock	 joke 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	when	you	put	all	of	these	 element 	 s 	 	together	--	when	you	get	the	viral	appeal	of	a	great	joke	with	a	 power 	 ful 	 	 punch 	 line 	 	that	's	 craft 	 ed 	 	from	 honest 	 y 	 	and	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	,	it	can	have	a	real	world	impact	at	changing	a	conversation	.
now	i	have	a	close	friend	,	joel	pett	,	who	's	the	 editor 	 ial 	 	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	for	the	lexington	herald	-	 lead 	 er 	 	.
and	he	used	to	be	the	usa	 to 	 day 	 	monday	 morn 	 ing 	 	guy	.
i	was	 visit 	 ing 	 	with	joel	the	 week 	 end 	 	before	the	copenhagen	 con 	 ference 	 	on	climate	change	 open 	 ed 	 	in	december	of	2009	.
and	joel	was	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	me	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	usa	 to 	 day 	 	was	one	of	america	's	four	 paper 	 s 	 	of	record	,	it	would	be	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	by	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 every 	 one 	 	in	 attend 	 ance 	 	at	the	 con 	 ference 	 	,	which	 me 	 ant 	 	that	,	if	he	hit	it	out	of	the	park	with	his	cartoon	on	monday	,	the	 open 	 ing 	 	day	of	the	 con 	 ference 	 	,	it	could	get	 pass 	 ed 	 	around	at	the	highest	level	among	actual	decision	-	makers	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	climate	change	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	joel	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	both	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	the	same	thing	,	which	was	how	so	much	of	the	debate	was	still	focused	on	the	science	and	how	complete	it	was	or	was	n't	,	which	,	to	both	of	us	,	 seem 	 s 	 	 some 	 what 	 	 intentional 	 ly 	 	off	point	.
 be 	 cause 	 	first	of	all	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	false	 pre 	 mise 	 	that	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 a 	 s 	 	complete	science	 exist 	 s 	 	.
now	 govern 	 or 	 	perry	of	my	 new 	 ly 	 	-	 adopt 	 ed 	 	state	of	texas	was	 push 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	same	line	 th 	 is 	 	past	summer	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	his	 oop 	 s 	 	-	 fat 	 ed 	 	campaign	for	the	republican	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 nomi 	 nation 	 	,	proclaiming	over	and	over	that	the	science	was	n't	complete	at	the	same	time	that	250	out	of	254	 count 	 ies 	 	in	the	state	of	texas	 we 	 re 	 	on	fire	.
and	perry	's	policy	solution	was	to	ask	the	people	of	texas	to	pray	for	rain	.
 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	was	 pray 	 ing 	 	for	four	more	 fire 	 s 	 	so	we	could	 final 	 ly 	 	complete	the	damn	science	.
but	back	in	2009	,	the	question	joel	and	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	over	and	over	was	why	 th 	 is 	 	late	in	the	game	so	much	energy	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	science	when	the	 poli 	 cies 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	address	climate	change	 we 	 re 	 	unequivocally	 benefici 	 al 	 	for	 human 	 ity 	 	in	the	long	run	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	science	.
so	we	 to 	 s 	 s 	 ed 	 	it	back	and	forth	 un 	 til 	 	joel	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
cartoon	:	``	what	if	it	's	a	big	hoax	and	we	create	a	better	world	for	 noth 	 ing 	 	?	``
you	've	got	to	love	that	idea	.
how	about	that	?	how	about	we	create	a	better	world	for	 noth 	 ing 	 	?
not	for	god	,	not	for	country	,	not	for	profit	--	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	metric	for	global	decision	-	making	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	cartoon	hit	the	bull	's	eye	.
 short 	 ly 	 	after	the	 con 	 ference 	 	was	over	,	joel	got	a	request	for	a	 sign 	 ed 	 	copy	from	the	head	of	the	epa	in	washington	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	wall	it	now	 hang 	 s 	 	on	.
and	not	long	after	that	,	he	got	 an 	 other 	 	request	for	a	copy	from	the	head	of	the	epa	in	california	who	used	it	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	her	 present 	 ation 	 	at	an	 inter 	 national 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	on	climate	change	in	sacramento	last	year	.
and	it	did	n't	stop	there	.
to	date	,	joel	's	gotten	 request 	 s 	 	from	over	40	 environment 	 al 	 	 group 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	canada	and	europe	.
and	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	he	got	a	request	from	the	green	party	in	australia	who	used	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	campaign	where	it	 be 	 came 	 	part	of	the	debate	that	 result 	 ed 	 	in	the	australian	parliament	 adopt 	 ing 	 	the	most	 rigor 	 ous 	 	carbon	tax	regime	of	any	country	in	the	world	.
that	is	a	lot	of	punch	for	14	 word 	 s 	 	.
so	my	 suggest 	 ion 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	out	here	who	are	 serious 	 ly 	 	focused	on	creating	a	better	world	is	to	take	a	little	bit	of	time	each	day	and	practice	 think 	 ing 	 	funny	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	might	just	find	the	question	that	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	for	.
thank	you	.
