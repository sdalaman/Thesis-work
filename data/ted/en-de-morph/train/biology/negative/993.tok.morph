 understand 	 ing 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	us	to	shift	our	 per 	 ception 	 	of	 sea 	 food 	 	away	from	a	 commodit 	 y 	 	to	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 re 	 store 	 	our	 eco 	 system 	 	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	for	us	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	 sea 	 food 	 	that	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	so	fortunate	to	eat	.
so	what	do	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	?
i	think	we	call	it	 resto 	 rative 	 	 sea 	 food 	 	.
where	 sustain 	 ability 	 	is	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 endur 	 e 	 	and	maintain	,	 resto 	 rative 	 	is	the	ability	to	replenish	and	progress	.
 resto 	 rative 	 	 sea 	 food 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	for	an	 evolv 	 ing 	 	and	dynamic	system	and	 acknowledg 	 es 	 	our	relationship	with	the	ocean	 a 	 s 	 	a	resource	,	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	we	engage	to	replenish	the	ocean	and	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 resili 	 ency 	 	.
it	is	a	more	 hope 	 ful 	 	,	it	is	a	more	human	,	and	is	a	more	 use 	 ful 	 	way	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	our	environment	.
wallet	 guide 	 s 	 	--	standard	issue	by	 lot 	 s 	 	in	the	marine	 conserv 	 ation 	 	world	--	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 hand 	 y 	 	;	they	're	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	tool	.
green	,	yellow	and	red	 list 	 s 	 	[	of	]	 sea 	 food 	 	species	.
the	 associ 	 ation 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	:	buy	green	,	do	n't	buy	red	,	think	twice	about	yellow	.
but	in	my	mind	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	just	eat	green	list	.
we	ca	n't	sustain	 th 	 is 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	measure	of	our	success	 re 	 ally 	 	changing	the	fate	of	the	species	in	the	yellow	and	the	red	.
but	what	if	we	eat	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	green	list	?
you	've	got	pole	-	caught	 yellow 	 fin 	 	tuna	here	--	 come 	 s 	 	from	 sustain 	 able 	 	 stock 	 s 	 	.
pole	caught	--	no	 by 	 catch 	 	.

but	it	's	a	lion	of	the	sea	.	it	's	a	top	predator	.
what	's	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	meal	?
am	i	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	down	in	a	 steak 	 house 	 	to	a	16	-	ounce	 port 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
do	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	?
i	might	still	be	in	the	green	list	,	but	i	'm	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	or	you	,	or	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	any	 favor 	 s 	 	.
the	point	is	that	we	have	to	have	a	 con 	 text 	 	,	a	gauge	for	our	 action 	 s 	 	in	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
 ex 	 ample 	 	:	i	've	heard	that	red	wine	is	great	for	my	health	--	 antioxidant 	 s 	 	and	 mineral 	 s 	 	--	heart	 health 	 y 	 	.
that	's	great	!	i	love	red	wine	!
i	'm	going	to	drink	so	much	of	it	.	i	'm	going	to	be	so	 health 	 y 	 	.
well	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 bottle 	 s 	 	is	it	before	you	tell	me	that	i	have	a	problem	?
well	 folk 	 s 	 	,	we	have	a	protein	problem	.
we	have	lost	 th 	 is 	 	 sens 	 ibility 	 	when	it	 regard 	 s 	 	our	food	,	and	we	are	 pay 	 ing 	 	a	cost	.
the	problem	is	we	are	 hid 	 ing 	 	that	cost	 be 	 neath 	 	the	 wave 	 s 	 	.
we	are	 hid 	 ing 	 	that	cost	 be 	 hind 	 	the	social	 accept 	 ance 	 	of	 expand 	 ing 	 	 waist 	 lines 	 	.
and	we	are	 hid 	 ing 	 	that	cost	 be 	 hind 	 	 mon 	 ster 	 	 profit 	 s 	 	.
so	the	first	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 resto 	 rative 	 	 sea 	 food 	 	is	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 take 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	account	our	 need 	 s 	 	.
 resto 	 rative 	 	 sea 	 food 	 	might	best	be	 represent 	 ed 	 	not	by	 jaw 	 s 	 	,	or	by	 flip 	 per 	 	,	or	the	gordon	's	 fish 	 er 	 man 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	by	the	 jol 	 ly 	 	green	giant	.
 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	:	they	might	yet	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
sylvia	 like 	 s 	 	to	say	that	blue	is	the	new	green	.
well	i	'd	like	to	 respect 	 fully 	 	submit	that	 broc 	 coli 	 	green	might	then	be	the	new	blue	.
we	must	 continu 	 e 	 	to	eat	the	best	 sea 	 food 	 	possible	,	if	at	all	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	must	eat	it	with	a	ton	of	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	.
the	best	part	about	 resto 	 rative 	 	 sea 	 food 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	is	that	it	 come 	 s 	 	on	the	half	-	shell	with	a	bottle	of	tabasco	and	lemon	 wedge 	 s 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	in	a	five	-	ounce	 port 	 ion 	 	of	tilapia	 bread 	 ed 	 	with	dijon	 must 	 ard 	 	and	 crisp 	 y 	 	,	 broil 	 ed 	 	 bread 	 crumb 	 s 	 	and	a	 s 	 team 	 ing 	 	pile	of	 pe 	 can 	 	 qui 	 no 	 a 	 	 pil 	 af 	 	with	 crunch 	 y 	 	,	 grill 	 ed 	 	 broc 	 coli 	 	so	soft	and	sweet	and	 char 	 red 	 	and	 smok 	 y 	 	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	with	just	a	hint	of	chili	flake	.
whooo	!
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	easy	sell	.
and	the	best	part	is	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	are	 avail 	 able 	 	to	every	family	at	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	walmart	.
jamie	oliver	is	 campaign 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	america	from	the	way	we	eat	.
sylvia	is	 campaign 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	from	the	way	we	eat	.
there	's	a	pattern	here	.
forget	nuclear	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	;	it	's	the	 for 	 k 	 	that	we	have	to	worry	about	.
we	have	 ravage 	 d 	 	our	earth	and	then	used	the	food	that	we	've	sourced	to	handicap	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	more	ways	than	one	.
so	i	think	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	whole	eating	thing	wrong	.
and	so	i	think	it	's	time	we	change	what	we	expect	from	our	food	.
 sustain 	 ability 	 	is	 complic 	 ated 	 	but	 d 	 inner 	 	is	a	 re 	 ality 	 	that	we	all	 ver 	 y 	 	much	understand	.
so	let	's	start	there	.
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	of	 move 	 ment 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	in	 green 	 ing 	 	our	food	 system 	 s 	 	.
dan	 barb 	 er 	 	and	alice	 water 	 s 	 	are	 lead 	 ing 	 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	the	green	food	 delic 	 ious 	 	revolution	.
but	green	 food 	 s 	 	often	represent	a	way	for	us	to	 dis 	 regard 	 	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 eater 	 s 	 	.
just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	green	source	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	we	can	treat	it	with	 dis 	 regard 	 	on	the	plate	.
we	have	eco	-	friendly	shrimp	.
we	can	make	them	;	we	have	that	technology	.
but	we	can	never	have	any	eco	-	friendly	all	-	you	-	can	-	eat	shrimp	buffet	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
heart	-	 health 	 y 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	 resto 	 rative 	 	 sea 	 food 	 	.
while	we	try	to	manage	 dec 	 lining 	 	marine	 population 	 s 	 	,	the	media	's	 recommend 	 ing 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	consumption	of	 sea 	 food 	 	.
 stud 	 ies 	 	say	that	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	american	 grand 	 mother 	 s 	 	,	 grand 	 father 	 s 	 	,	 mother 	 s 	 	and	 father 	 s 	 	might	be	around	for	 an 	 other 	 	 birth 	 day 	 	if	we	 include 	 d 	 	more	 sea 	 food 	 	.
that	's	a	reward	i	am	not	 will 	 ing 	 	to	pass	up	.
but	it	's	not	all	about	the	 sea 	 food 	 	.
it	's	about	the	way	that	we	look	at	our	 plate 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	chef	,	i	 real 	 ize 	 	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	thing	for	me	to	do	is	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 port 	 ion 	 	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	on	my	plate	.
a	couple	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	made	more	money	.
people	 start 	 ed 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	 appetiz 	 ers 	 	and	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 k 	 new 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	fill	up	on	the	 ent 	 re 	 es 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
people	 s 	 pent 	 	more	time	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 meal 	 s 	 	,	 engag 	 ing 	 	with	each	other	over	 the 	 ir 	 	 meal 	 s 	 	.
people	got	,	in	short	,	more	of	what	they	came	there	for	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	got	less	protein	.
they	got	more	 calorie 	 s 	 	over	the	course	of	a	 divers 	 ified 	 	meal	.
they	got	 health 	 ier 	 	.	i	made	more	money	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	great	.
 environment 	 al 	 	 consider 	 ation 	 	was	 serv 	 ed 	 	with	every	plate	,	but	it	was	 serv 	 ed 	 	with	a	 heap 	 ing 	 	mound	of	 consider 	 ation 	 	for	human	 interest 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
one	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	we	did	was	begin	to	 divers 	 ify 	 	the	species	that	we	 serv 	 ed 	 	--	small	 silver 	 fish 	 	,	 anchov 	 ies 	 	,	 mack 	 er 	 el 	 	,	 s 	 ard 	 ine 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 common 	 	.
 shell 	 fish 	 	,	 mussel 	 s 	 	,	 oyster 	 s 	 	,	 clam 	 s 	 	,	tilapia	,	char	--	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	common	species	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 direct 	 ing 	 	 taste 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	more	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	more	 resto 	 rative 	 	 option 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	need	to	favor	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	green	list	 say 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	how	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	begin	to	 re 	 store 	 	our	environment	.
but	what	of	 t 	 hose 	 	big	 predator 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 fashion 	 able 	 	species	,	that	green	list	tuna	that	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	?
well	,	if	you	must	,	i	have	a	recipe	for	you	.
it	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 work 	 s 	 	with	any	big	fish	in	the	ocean	,	so	here	we	go	.
start	with	a	16	-	ounce	 port 	 ion 	 	of	big	fish	.
get	a	knife	.	cut	it	 in 	 to 	 	four	 port 	 ions 	 	.
put	it	on	four	 plate 	 s 	 	.
mound	up	 t 	 hose 	 	four	 plate 	 s 	 	with	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	and	then	open	up	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	bottle	of	burgundy	you	have	,	light	the	 candle 	 s 	 	and	 celebr 	 ate 	 	it	.
 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	you	have	to	eat	 th 	 is 	 	.
 invit 	 e 	 	your	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 neighbor 	 s 	 	over	and	repeat	once	a	year	,	 may 	 be 	 	.
i	expect	a	lot	from	food	.
i	expect	health	and	joy	and	family	and	community	.
i	expect	that	producing	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	 dish 	 es 	 	and	eating	 meal 	 s 	 	is	all	part	of	the	 commun 	 ion 	 	of	human	 interest 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	that	my	father	was	a	fantastic	cook	.
and	he	taught	me	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	about	the	privilege	that	eating	 represent 	 s 	 	.
i	remember	well	the	 meal 	 s 	 	of	my	 child 	 hood 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 reason 	 able 	 	 port 	 ions 	 	of	protein	 serv 	 ed 	 	with	 cop 	 ious 	 	 quant 	 ities 	 	of	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	and	small	 amount 	 s 	 	of	starch	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	rice	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	still	how	i	 large 	 ly 	 	eat	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	get	sick	when	i	go	to	 steak 	 house 	 s 	 	.
i	get	the	meat	 sweat 	 s 	 	.
it	's	like	a	 hang 	 over 	 	from	protein	.
it	's	 disgust 	 ing 	 	.
but	of	all	the	 di 	 re 	 	news	that	you	'll	hear	and	that	you	have	heard	about	the	state	of	our	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	i	have	the	 un 	 fortunate 	 	burden	of	 deliver 	 ing 	 	to	you	possibly	the	 ver 	 y 	 	worst	of	it	and	that	is	 th 	 is 	 	whole	time	your	mother	was	right	.
eat	your	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	.
so	what	are	we	looking	for	in	a	meal	?
well	for	health	,	i	'm	looking	for	 whole 	 some 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	that	are	good	for	my	body	.
for	joy	,	i	'm	looking	for	butter	and	salt	and	sexy	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	 thing 	 s 	 	taste	less	like	 pen 	 ance 	 	.
for	family	,	i	'm	looking	for	 recipe 	 s 	 	that	 gen 	 uf 	 lect 	 	to	my	own	personal	 histo 	 ries 	 	.
for	community	 th 	 ough 	 	,	we	start	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
there	's	no	 es 	 cap 	 ing 	 	the	fact	that	 every 	 thing 	 	we	eat	 ha 	 s 	 	a	global	impact	.
so	try	and	learn	 a 	 s 	 	best	you	can	what	that	impact	is	and	then	take	the	first	step	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	it	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	an	image	of	our	blue	planet	,	our	world	bank	.
but	it	is	more	than	just	a	 re 	 posit 	 ory 	 	of	our	 resource 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	global	 geo 	 graphy 	 	of	the	 commun 	 ion 	 	we	call	 d 	 inner 	 	.
so	if	we	all	take	 on 	 ly 	 	what	we	need	,	then	we	can	begin	to	share	the	rest	,	we	can	begin	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	,	we	can	begin	to	 re 	 store 	 	.
we	need	to	savor	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	savor	 small 	 er 	 	 port 	 ions 	 	of	 sea 	 food 	 	.
and	we	need	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	.
thank	you	.
