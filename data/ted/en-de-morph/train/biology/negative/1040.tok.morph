so	for	any	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 to 	 day 	 	,	let	's	start	out	by	 admit 	 ting 	 	we	're	 luck 	 y 	 	.
we	do	n't	live	in	the	world	our	 mother 	 s 	 	lived	in	,	our	 grand 	 mother 	 s 	 	lived	in	,	where	 care 	 er 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	for	women	 we 	 re 	 	so	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
and	if	you	're	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 to 	 day 	 	,	most	of	us	grew	up	in	a	world	where	we	had	 bas 	 ic 	 	civil	 right 	 s 	 	,	and	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	we	still	live	in	a	world	where	some	women	do	n't	have	them	.
but	all	that	 a 	 side 	 	,	we	still	have	a	problem	,	and	it	's	a	real	problem	.
and	the	problem	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	women	are	not	making	it	to	the	top	of	any	profession	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
the	 number 	 s 	 	tell	the	story	 quit 	 e 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
190	 head 	 s 	 	of	state	--	nine	are	women	.
of	all	the	people	in	parliament	in	the	world	,	13	percent	are	women	.
in	the	corporate	sector	,	women	at	the	top	,	c	-	level	 job 	 s 	 	,	board	 seat 	 s 	 	--	 top 	 s 	 	out	at	15	,	16	percent	.
the	 number 	 s 	 	have	not	 move 	 d 	 	since	2002	and	are	going	in	the	wrong	direction	.
and	even	in	the	non	-	profit	world	,	a	world	we	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	led	by	more	women	,	women	at	the	top	:	20	percent	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 an 	 other 	 	problem	,	which	is	that	women	face	 hard 	 er 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	between	professional	success	and	personal	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	.
a	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	in	the	u.s	.
 show 	 ed 	 	that	,	of	married	senior	 manage 	 rs 	 	,	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	married	men	had	children	and	 on 	 ly 	 	one	-	third	of	the	married	women	had	children	.
a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	in	new	york	,	and	i	was	 pitch 	 ing 	 	a	deal	,	and	i	was	in	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 f 	 ancy 	 	new	york	private	 equ 	 ity 	 	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	you	can	picture	.
and	i	'm	in	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	about	a	three	-	hour	 meet 	 ing 	 	--	and	two	 hour 	 s 	 	in	,	there	kind	of	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	that	bio	break	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	 stand 	 s 	 	up	,	and	the	partner	running	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	 start 	 s 	 	looking	 re 	 ally 	 	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	where	the	women	's	room	is	in	his	 off 	 ice 	 	.
so	i	start	looking	around	for	moving	boxes	,	 figur 	 ing 	 	they	just	 move 	 d 	 	in	,	but	i	do	n't	see	any	.
and	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	did	you	just	move	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	about	a	year	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	are	you	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	i	am	the	 on 	 ly 	 	woman	to	have	 pitch 	 ed 	 	a	deal	in	 th 	 is 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	in	a	year	?	``
and	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.	or	 may 	 be 	 	you	're	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	who	had	to	go	to	the	 bath 	 room 	 	.	``
so	the	question	is	,	how	are	we	going	to	fix	 th 	 is 	 	?
how	do	we	change	these	 number 	 s 	 	at	the	top	?
how	do	we	make	 th 	 is 	 	different	?
i	want	to	start	out	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	i	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	about	 keep 	 ing 	 	women	in	the	 work 	 force 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	's	the	answer	.
in	the	high	-	income	part	of	our	 work 	 force 	 	,	in	the	people	who	end	up	at	the	top	--	fortune	500	ceo	 job 	 s 	 	,	or	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	in	other	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	--	the	problem	,	i	am	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	,	is	that	women	are	dropping	out	.
now	people	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	a	lot	,	and	they	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 flex 	 time 	 	and	 mentor 	 ing 	 	and	 program 	 s 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	should	have	to	train	women	.
i	want	to	talk	about	 non 	 e 	 	of	that	 to 	 day 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	that	's	all	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	focus	on	what	we	can	do	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
what	are	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	we	need	to	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	?
what	are	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	we	tell	the	women	who	work	with	and	for	us	?
what	are	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	we	tell	our	 daughter 	 s 	 	?
now	,	at	the	 out 	 set 	 	,	i	want	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	that	 th 	 is 	 	speech	 come 	 s 	 	with	no	 judgment 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	the	right	answer	.
i	do	n't	even	have	it	for	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	left	san	francisco	,	where	i	live	,	on	monday	,	and	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	on	the	plane	for	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	.
and	my	daughter	,	who	's	three	,	when	i	 drop 	 ped 	 	her	off	at	 pre 	 school 	 	,	did	that	whole	 hugg 	 ing 	 	-	the	-	leg	,	 cry 	 ing 	 	,	``	 mom 	 my 	 	,	do	n't	get	on	the	plane	``	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	hard	.	i	feel	 guilt 	 y 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
i	know	no	women	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	at	home	or	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	in	the	 work 	 force 	 	,	who	do	n't	feel	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 stay 	 ing 	 	in	the	 work 	 force 	 	is	the	right	thing	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
my	talk	 to 	 day 	 	is	about	what	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	are	if	you	do	want	to	stay	in	the	 work 	 force 	 	,	and	i	think	there	are	three	.
one	,	 s 	 it 	 	at	the	table	.
two	,	make	your	partner	a	real	partner	.
and	three	,	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	before	you	 leav 	 e 	 	.
number	one	:	 s 	 it 	 	at	the	table	.
just	a	couple	 week 	 s 	 	ago	at	facebook	,	we	 host 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	senior	government	official	,	and	he	came	in	to	meet	with	senior	 exec 	 s 	 	from	around	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	kind	of	 s 	 at 	 	at	the	table	.
and	then	he	had	these	two	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	with	him	who	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	senior	in	his	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	and	i	kind	of	 s 	 aid 	 	to	them	,	``	 s 	 it 	 	at	the	table	.	come	on	,	 s 	 it 	 	at	the	table	,	``	and	they	 s 	 at 	 	on	the	side	of	the	room	.
when	i	was	in	college	my	senior	year	,	i	took	a	course	 call 	 ed 	 	european	intellectual	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
do	n't	you	love	that	kind	of	thing	from	college	?
i	wish	i	could	do	that	now	.
and	i	took	it	with	my	 room 	 mate 	 	,	carrie	,	who	was	then	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 liter 	 ary 	 	student	--	and	went	on	to	be	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 liter 	 ary 	 	scholar	--	and	my	brother	--	smart	guy	,	but	a	water	-	polo	-	 play 	 ing 	 	pre	-	med	,	who	was	a	 s 	 op 	 homo 	 re 	 	.
the	three	of	us	take	 th 	 is 	 	class	together	.
and	then	carrie	 read 	 s 	 	all	the	 book 	 s 	 	in	the	original	greek	and	latin	,	 go 	 es 	 	to	all	the	 lectur 	 es 	 	.
i	read	all	the	 book 	 s 	 	in	english	and	go	to	most	of	the	 lectur 	 es 	 	.
my	brother	is	kind	of	 bus 	 y 	 	.
he	 read 	 s 	 	one	book	of	12	and	 go 	 es 	 	to	a	couple	of	 lectur 	 es 	 	,	 march 	 es 	 	 him 	 self 	 	up	to	our	room	a	couple	 day 	 s 	 	before	the	 ex 	 am 	 	to	get	 him 	 self 	 	 tutor 	 ed 	 	.
the	three	of	us	go	to	the	 ex 	 am 	 	together	,	and	we	 s 	 it 	 	down	.
and	we	 s 	 it 	 	there	for	three	 hour 	 s 	 	--	and	our	little	blue	 note 	 book 	 s 	 	--	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	'm	that	old	.
and	we	walk	out	,	and	we	look	at	each	other	,	and	we	say	,	``	how	did	you	do	?	``
and	carrie	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	boy	,	i	feel	like	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	draw	out	the	main	point	on	the	hegelian	 dialect 	 ic 	 	.	``
and	i	say	,	``	god	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	wish	i	had	 re 	 ally 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	john	locke	's	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 proper 	 ty 	 	with	the	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	who	follow	.	``
and	my	brother	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	got	the	top	grade	in	the	class	.	``
``	you	got	the	top	grade	in	the	class	?
you	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``
the	problem	with	these	 st 	 ories 	 	is	that	they	show	what	the	data	 show 	 s 	 	:	women	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	 under 	 estimate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	abilities	.
if	you	test	men	and	women	,	and	you	ask	them	 question 	 s 	 	on	 total 	 ly 	 	 object 	 ive 	 	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	like	gpas	,	men	get	it	wrong	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	high	,	and	women	get	it	wrong	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	low	.
women	do	not	 negoti 	 ate 	 	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	 work 	 force 	 	.
a	 stud 	 y 	 	in	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	people	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	 work 	 force 	 	out	of	college	 show 	 ed 	 	that	57	percent	of	 boy 	 s 	 	 enter 	 ing 	 	,	or	men	,	i	guess	,	are	 negoti 	 ating 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	seven	percent	of	women	.
and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	men	 attribut 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	success	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	women	 attribut 	 e 	 	it	to	other	external	 factor 	 s 	 	.
if	you	ask	men	why	they	did	a	good	job	,	they	'll	say	,	``	i	'm	awesome	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	.	why	are	you	even	 ask 	 ing 	 	?	``
if	you	ask	women	why	they	did	a	good	job	,	what	they	'll	say	is	 some 	 one 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	them	,	they	got	 luck 	 y 	 	,	they	 work 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	matter	?
boy	,	it	 matter 	 s 	 	a	lot	 be 	 cause 	 	no	one	 get 	 s 	 	to	the	corner	 off 	 ice 	 	by	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	side	,	not	at	the	table	,	and	no	one	 get 	 s 	 	the	 pro 	 motion 	 	if	they	do	n't	think	they	deserve	 the 	 ir 	 	success	,	or	they	do	n't	even	understand	 the 	 ir 	 	own	success	.
i	wish	the	answer	 we 	 re 	 	easy	.
i	wish	i	could	just	go	tell	all	the	young	women	i	work	for	,	all	these	fabulous	women	,	``	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 your 	 self 	 	and	 negoti 	 ate 	 	for	 your 	 self 	 	.
own	your	own	success	.	``
i	wish	i	could	tell	that	to	my	daughter	.
but	it	's	not	that	simple	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	the	data	 show 	 s 	 	,	above	all	else	,	is	one	thing	,	which	is	that	success	and	 like 	 ability 	 	are	 positive 	 ly 	 	 correlate 	 d 	 	for	men	and	 negative 	 ly 	 	 correlate 	 d 	 	for	women	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	's	 nod 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	know	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	true	.
there	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 stud 	 y 	 	that	 show 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
there	's	a	famous	harvard	business	school	 stud 	 y 	 	on	a	woman	named	heidi	roizen	.
and	she	's	an	 oper 	 ator 	 	in	a	company	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	and	she	uses	her	 contact 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	venture	 capital 	 ist 	 	.
in	2002	--	not	so	long	ago	--	a	professor	who	was	then	at	columbia	university	took	that	case	and	made	it	howard	roizen	.
and	he	 g 	 ave 	 	the	case	out	,	both	of	them	,	to	two	 group 	 s 	 	of	 student 	 s 	 	.
he	 change 	 d 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	one	word	:	``	heidi	``	to	``	howard	.	``
but	that	one	word	made	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
he	then	 survey 	 ed 	 	the	 student 	 s 	 	,	and	the	good	news	was	the	 student 	 s 	 	,	both	men	and	women	,	thought	heidi	and	howard	 we 	 re 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	 compete 	 nt 	 	,	and	that	's	good	.
the	bad	news	was	that	 every 	 one 	 	 like 	 d 	 	howard	.
he	's	a	great	guy	.	you	want	to	work	for	him	.
you	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	day	 fish 	 ing 	 	with	him	.
but	heidi	?	not	so	 s 	 ure 	 	.
she	's	a	little	out	for	 her 	 self 	 	.	she	's	a	little	 politic 	 al 	 	.
you	're	not	 s 	 ure 	 	you	'd	want	to	work	for	her	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 complic 	 ation 	 	.
we	have	to	tell	our	 daughter 	 s 	 	and	our	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	we	got	the	a	,	to	reach	for	the	 pro 	 motion 	 	,	to	 s 	 it 	 	at	the	table	,	and	we	have	to	do	it	in	a	world	where	,	for	them	,	there	are	 sacrifice 	 s 	 	they	will	make	for	that	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 brother 	 s 	 	,	there	are	not	.
the	 s 	 add 	 est 	 	thing	about	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	remember	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	'm	about	to	tell	a	story	which	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	for	me	,	but	i	think	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	at	facebook	not	so	long	ago	to	about	100	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	and	a	couple	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	there	was	a	young	woman	who	 work 	 s 	 	there	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	my	little	desk	,	and	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	talk	to	me	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	and	she	 s 	 at 	 	down	,	and	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	i	need	to	keep	my	hand	up	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	do	you	mean	?	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	're	giving	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	and	you	 s 	 aid 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	take	two	more	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	i	had	my	hand	up	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	people	,	and	you	took	two	more	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	i	put	my	hand	down	,	and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	all	the	women	put	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	down	,	and	then	you	took	more	 question 	 s 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	from	the	men	.	``
and	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	if	it	's	me	--	who	 care 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	--	giving	 th 	 is 	 	talk	--	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	i	ca	n't	even	notice	that	the	men	's	 hand 	 s 	 	are	still	raised	,	and	the	women	's	 hand 	 s 	 	are	still	raised	,	how	good	are	we	 a 	 s 	 	 manage 	 rs 	 	of	our	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	our	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	at	 see 	 ing 	 	that	the	men	are	 reach 	 ing 	 	for	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	more	than	women	?
we	've	got	to	get	women	to	 s 	 it 	 	at	the	table	.
 mess 	 age 	 	number	two	:	make	your	partner	a	real	partner	.
i	've	 be 	 come 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	we	've	made	more	progress	in	the	 work 	 force 	 	than	we	have	in	the	home	.
the	data	 show 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
if	a	woman	and	a	man	work	full	-	time	and	have	a	child	,	the	woman	 do 	 es 	 	twice	the	amount	of	 house 	 work 	 	the	man	 do 	 es 	 	,	and	the	woman	 do 	 es 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	 child 	 care 	 	the	man	 do 	 es 	 	.
so	she	's	got	three	 job 	 s 	 	or	two	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	got	one	.
who	do	you	think	 drop 	 s 	 	out	when	 some 	 one 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	home	more	?
the	 cause 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	have	time	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	them	.
and	i	do	n't	think	sunday	 foot 	 ball 	 	-	 watch 	 ing 	 	and	general	 laz 	 iness 	 	is	the	cause	.
i	think	the	cause	is	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	we	put	more	pressure	on	our	 boy 	 s 	 	to	succeed	than	we	do	on	our	 girl 	 s 	 	.
i	know	men	that	stay	home	and	work	in	the	home	to	support	wives	with	 care 	 ers 	 	,	and	it	's	hard	.
when	i	go	to	the	 mom 	 my 	 	-	and	-	me	stuff	and	i	see	the	father	there	,	i	notice	that	the	other	 mom 	 mies 	 	do	n't	play	with	him	.
and	that	's	a	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	to	make	it	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	a	job	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	 hard 	 est 	 	job	in	the	world	to	work	 in 	 side 	 	the	home	,	for	people	of	both	 gender 	 s 	 	,	if	we	're	going	to	even	 thing 	 s 	 	out	and	let	women	stay	in	the	 work 	 force 	 	.
 stud 	 ies 	 	show	that	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	with	equal	 earn 	 ing 	 	and	equal	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	half	the	divorce	rate	.
and	if	that	was	n't	good	 en 	 ough 	 	 motiv 	 ation 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	out	there	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	have	more	--	how	 s 	 hall 	 	i	say	 th 	 is 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	stage	?	--	they	know	each	other	more	in	the	biblical	sense	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 mess 	 age 	 	number	three	:	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	before	you	 leav 	 e 	 	.
i	think	there	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	deep	 iron 	 y 	 	to	the	fact	that	 action 	 s 	 	women	are	taking	--	and	i	see	 th 	 is 	 	all	the	time	--	with	the	 object 	 ive 	 	of	 stay 	 ing 	 	in	the	 work 	 force 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	lead	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	.
here	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	:	we	're	all	 bus 	 y 	 	.	 every 	 one 	 	's	 bus 	 y 	 	.	a	woman	's	 bus 	 y 	 	.
and	she	 start 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	child	,	and	from	the	moment	she	 start 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	child	,	she	 start 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	making	room	for	that	child	.
``	how	am	i	going	to	fit	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	 liter 	 ally 	 	from	that	moment	,	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	raise	her	hand	 any 	 more 	 	,	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	for	a	 pro 	 motion 	 	,	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	on	the	new	project	,	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	say	,	``	me	.	i	want	to	do	that	.	``
she	 start 	 s 	 	 lean 	 ing 	 	back	.
the	problem	is	that	--	let	's	say	she	got	 pregn 	 ant 	 	that	day	,	that	day	--	nine	 month 	 s 	 	of	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	,	three	 month 	 s 	 	of	 mat 	 ern 	 ity 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	,	six	 month 	 s 	 	to	catch	your	breath	--	fast	-	forward	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	more	often	--	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	it	--	women	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	way	 ear 	 lier 	 	--	when	they	get	 engag 	 ed 	 	,	when	they	get	married	,	when	they	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	have	a	child	,	which	can	take	a	long	time	.
one	woman	came	to	see	me	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	kind	of	 look 	 ed 	 	at	her	--	she	 look 	 ed 	 	a	little	young	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	are	you	and	your	husband	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	baby	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	no	,	i	'm	not	married	.	``
she	did	n't	even	have	a	boyfriend	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	just	way	too	early	.	``
but	the	point	is	that	what	 happen 	 s 	 	once	you	start	kind	of	 quiet 	 ly 	 	 lean 	 ing 	 	back	?
 every 	 one 	 	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	,	once	you	have	a	child	at	home	,	your	job	better	be	 re 	 ally 	 	good	to	go	back	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	hard	to	 leav 	 e 	 	that	kid	at	home	--	your	job	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 challeng 	 ing 	 	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 reward 	 ing 	 	.
you	need	to	feel	like	you	're	making	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	if	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	you	did	n't	take	a	 pro 	 motion 	 	and	some	guy	next	to	you	did	,	if	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	you	 stop 	 ped 	 	looking	for	new	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	,	you	're	going	to	be	 bor 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	should	have	 ke 	 pt 	 	your	foot	on	the	gas	 ped 	 al 	 	.
do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	before	you	 leav 	 e 	 	.
stay	in	.
keep	your	foot	on	the	gas	 ped 	 al 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	day	you	need	to	 leav 	 e 	 	to	take	a	break	for	a	child	--	and	then	make	your	 decision 	 s 	 	.
do	n't	make	 decision 	 s 	 	too	far	in	advance	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	you	're	not	even	conscious	you	're	making	.
my	generation	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	is	not	going	to	change	the	 number 	 s 	 	at	the	top	.
they	're	just	not	moving	.
we	are	not	going	to	get	to	where	50	percent	of	the	population	--	in	my	generation	,	there	will	not	be	50	percent	of	[	women	]	at	the	top	of	any	industry	.
but	i	'm	 hope 	 ful 	 	that	future	 generation 	 s 	 	can	.
i	think	a	world	that	was	run	where	half	of	our	 count 	 ries 	 	and	half	of	our	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	run	by	women	,	would	be	a	better	world	.
and	it	's	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	people	would	know	where	the	women	's	 bath 	 rooms 	 	are	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	that	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	.
i	think	it	would	be	a	better	world	.
i	have	two	children	.
i	have	a	five	-	year	-	old	son	and	a	two	-	year	-	old	daughter	.
i	want	my	son	to	have	a	choice	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	fully	in	the	 work 	 force 	 	or	at	home	,	and	i	want	my	daughter	to	have	the	choice	to	not	just	succeed	,	but	to	be	 like 	 d 	 	for	her	 accomplish 	 ments 	 	.
thank	you	.
