hi	 every 	 one 	 	.	i	'm	sirena	.
i	'm	11	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	from	connecticut	.
well	,	i	'm	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	why	i	'm	here	.
i	mean	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	have	to	do	with	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	design	?
well	,	i	count	my	ipod	,	 cell 	 phone 	 	and	computer	 a 	 s 	 	technology	but	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	that	.
so	i	did	a	little	research	on	it	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	found	.
of	course	,	i	hope	i	can	 memor 	 ize 	 	it	.
the	 viol 	 in 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	made	of	a	wood	box	and	four	main	 string 	 s 	 	.
by	 play 	 ing 	 	the	string	,	the	string	 vib 	 rates 	 	and	 produce 	 s 	 	a	sound	wave	.
sound	 pass 	 es 	 	through	a	piece	of	wood	 call 	 ed 	 	a	bridge	and	 go 	 es 	 	down	to	the	wood	box	and	 get 	 s 	 	 ampl 	 ified 	 	but	...	let	me	think	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	on	the	other	hand	by	placing	your	finger	in	a	different	position	on	the	 finger 	 board 	 	it	 change 	 s 	 	the	string	length	,	that	 change 	 s 	 	the	frequency	of	the	sound	wave	.
oh	,	my	 go 	 sh 	 	!
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	a	technology	but	i	can	call	it	a	16th	-	century	technology	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	most	 fasci 	 nating 	 	thing	that	i	found	was	that	even	the	audio	system	or	wave	 trans 	 mission 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	are	still	 bas 	 ically 	 	based	on	the	same	principle	of	producing	and	 project 	 ing 	 	sound	.
is	n't	that	cool	?
design	--	i	love	 it 	 s 	 	design	.
i	remember	when	i	was	little	my	mom	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	would	you	like	to	play	the	 viol 	 in 	 	or	the	piano	?
i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	that	giant	 mon 	 ster 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	--	i	am	not	going	to	lock	 my 	 self 	 	on	that	bench	the	whole	day	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	small	and	 light 	 weight 	 	.
i	can	play	from	 stand 	 ing 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	or	 walk 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	know	what	?
the	best	of	all	is	that	if	i	do	n't	want	to	practice	,	i	can	hide	it	.
the	 viol 	 in 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
some	people	 re 	 late 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	the	shape	of	a	 lad 	 y 	 	but	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	like	it	or	not	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	so	for	more	than	400	 year 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 like 	 	modern	stuff	that	 eas 	 ily 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 d 	 ated 	 	.
but	i	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	personal	and	 un 	 ique 	 	that	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	each	 viol 	 in 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	similar	,	that	no	two	 viol 	 in 	 s 	 	sound	the	same	.
even	from	the	same	maker	or	based	on	the	same	model	.
 entertain 	 ment 	 	--	i	love	the	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	instrument	 it 	 self 	 	is	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 entertain 	 ing 	 	.
i	mean	,	when	i	first	got	my	 viol 	 in 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	play	around	,	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	 be 	 cause 	 	it	did	n't	sound	like	the	way	i	'd	heard	from	other	 kid 	 s 	 	--	so	 horr 	 ible 	 	and	so	 scratch 	 y 	 	--	so	it	was	n't	 entertain 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
but	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	,	my	brother	found	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	funny	.
 yu 	 k 	 	,	 yu 	 k 	 	,	 yu 	 k 	 	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	i	heard	a	joke	about	the	 great 	 est 	 	 viol 	 in 	 ist 	 	,	jascha	heifetz	.
after	mr.	heifetz	's	concert	a	 lad 	 y 	 	came	over	and	 compliment 	 ed 	 	,	``	oh	,	mr.	heifetz	,	your	 viol 	 in 	 	 sound 	 ed 	 	so	great	 to 	 night 	 	.	``
and	mr.	heifetz	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	person	,	so	he	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	his	 viol 	 in 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	funny	,	i	do	n't	hear	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``
and	now	,	i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	 music 	 ian 	 	,	we	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	we	have	a	great	mind	,	 art 	 istic 	 	heart	and	skill	that	can	change	the	16th	-	century	technology	and	a	 legend 	 ary 	 	design	to	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
now	,	i	know	why	i	'm	here	.
at	first	i	thought	i	was	just	going	to	be	here	to	perform	,	but	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 ly 	 	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	and	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	much	more	.
but	...	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	up	there	for	me	.
like	the	multi	-	dimension	stuff	.
i	mean	,	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	i	'd	be	happy	 en 	 ough 	 	if	i	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	my	two	dimension	correct	in	school	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	most	 impress 	 ive 	 	thing	to	me	is	that	...	well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	stand	 th 	 is 	 	for	all	children	is	to	say	,	thank	you	,	to	all	 adult 	 s 	 	for	 actual 	 ly 	 	 car 	 ing 	 	for	us	a	lot	and	to	make	our	future	world	much	better	.
thank	you	.
