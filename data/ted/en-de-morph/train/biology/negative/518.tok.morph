it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	.	there	are	nine	,	sort	of	,	 rule 	 s 	 	that	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	after	35	 year 	 s 	 	of	rock	 climb 	 ing 	 	.
most	of	them	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	.
number	one	:	do	n't	let	go	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	success	method	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	--	often	you	think	about	 lett 	 ing 	 	go	way	before	your	body	 do 	 es 	 	.
so	hang	in	there	,	and	you	come	up	with	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	peculiar	 solution 	 s 	 	.
number	two	:	 hesit 	 ation 	 	is	bad	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	friction	climb	,	up	in	tuolumne	 meadow 	 s 	 	,	in	the	yosemite	high	country	.
friction	 climb 	 ing 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	sort	of	hard	positive	 edge 	 s 	 	.
you	're	 climb 	 ing 	 	on	little	 d 	 imp 	 les 	 	and	 nub 	 bin 	 s 	 	in	the	rock	.
the	most	friction	you	have	is	when	you	first	put	your	hand	or	your	foot	on	the	rock	.
and	then	from	that	point	on	,	you	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
so	 moment 	 um 	 	is	good	.	do	n't	stop	.
rule	number	three	:	have	a	plan	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	climb	 call 	 ed 	 	the	naked	edge	,	in	el	dorado	canyon	,	 out 	 side 	 	of	boulder	.
 th 	 is 	 	 climb 	 er 	 	is	on	the	last	pitch	of	it	.
he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	right	about	where	i	fell	.
there	is	about	1,000	feet	of	air	 be 	 low 	 	him	.
and	all	the	hard	 pitch 	 es 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 low 	 	him	.
often	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	're	 plan 	 ning 	 	so	hard	for	like	,	``	how	do	i	get	through	the	 hard 	 est 	 	part	?	how	do	i	get	through	the	 hard 	 est 	 	part	?	``
and	then	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
you	get	to	the	last	pitch	.	it	's	easy	.
and	you	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	 flame 	 d 	 	out	.	do	n't	do	it	.
you	have	to	plan	 a 	 head 	 	to	get	to	the	top	.
but	you	 al 	 so 	 	ca	n't	forget	that	each	individual	move	you	have	to	be	able	to	complete	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	climb	 call 	 ed 	 	the	dike	route	,	on	pywjack	 dom 	 e 	 	,	up	in	the	yosemite	high	country	.
the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	climb	is	it	's	not	that	hard	.
but	if	you	're	the	 lead 	 er 	 	on	it	,	at	the	 hard 	 est 	 	move	,	you	're	looking	at	about	100	foot	fall	,	onto	some	low	angle	 s 	 lab 	 s 	 	.
so	you	've	got	to	focus	.
you	do	n't	want	to	stop	in	the	middle	like	coleridge	's	kubla	kahn	.
you	've	got	to	keep	going	.
rule	number	five	:	know	how	to	rest	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	the	best	 climb 	 ers 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	in	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	can	get	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 in 	 to 	 	some	position	where	they	can	rest	,	 re 	 group 	 	,	calm	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	focus	,	and	keep	going	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	climb	in	the	 needle 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	in	california	.
fear	 re 	 ally 	 	 suck 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	is	you	're	not	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
you	're	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 fail 	 ing 	 	at	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	any	 give 	 n 	 	move	should	 requir 	 e 	 	all	your	 concent 	 ration 	 	and	thought	 process 	 es 	 	to	execute	it	 effective 	 ly 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 climb 	 ing 	 	is	,	most	people	sort	of	take	it	straight	on	.	and	they	follow	the	most	obvious	solution	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 devil 	 s 	 	tower	in	wyoming	,	which	is	a	 column 	 ar 	 	basalt	 form 	 ation 	 	that	most	of	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	from	``	close	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	.	``
with	 th 	 is 	 	,	 typical 	 ly 	 	crack	 climb 	 ers 	 	would	put	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	in	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 to 	 es 	 	in	and	just	start	 climb 	 ing 	 	.
the	 crack 	 s 	 	are	too	small	to	get	your	 to 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	so	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	climb	is	using	your	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	in	the	 crack 	 s 	 	,	and	using	 oppos 	 ing 	 	pressure	and	forcing	 your 	 self 	 	up	.
rule	number	eight	:	strength	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	equal	success	.
in	the	35	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	 climb 	 ing 	 	guide	and	taught	on	 in 	 door 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	,	and	stuff	like	that	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	,	 guy 	 s 	 	will	 al 	 ways 	 	try	to	do	pull	-	 up 	 s 	 	.
 begin 	 ning 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	it	's	like	,	they	 th 	 rash 	 	,	they	 th 	 rash 	 	,	they	get	15	feet	up	--	and	they	can	do	about	15	pull	-	 up 	 s 	 	right	--	and	then	they	just	flame	out	.
women	are	much	more	in	balance	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	that	idea	that	they	're	going	to	be	able	to	do	100	pull	-	 up 	 s 	 	.
they	think	about	how	to	get	the	weight	over	 the 	 ir 	 	feet	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	sort	of	natural	--	they	carry	you	all	day	long	.
so	balance	is	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	,	and	 keep 	 ing 	 	your	weight	on	your	feet	,	which	is	your	 strong 	 est 	 	muscle	.
and	of	course	there	is	rule	number	nine	.
i	came	up	with	rule	number	nine	after	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	n't	plan	for	a	fall	,	and	went	about	40	feet	and	 crack 	 ed 	 	a	rib	.
once	you	get	to	that	point	where	you	know	it	's	going	to	happen	,	you	need	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	you	're	going	to	let	go	 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	the	critical	piece	of	not	 get 	 ting 	 	hurt	--	how	you	're	going	to	fall	onto	the	rope	,	or	if	you	're	 climb 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	rope	,	fall	to	a	place	where	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	control	the	fall	.
so	do	n't	hang	on	till	the	bitter	end	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
