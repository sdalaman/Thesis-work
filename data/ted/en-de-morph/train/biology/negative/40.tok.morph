but	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	went	on	a	personal	journey	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	the	story	of	life	.
it	's	the	 hard 	 est 	 	thing	i	've	ever	 attempt 	 ed 	 	,	and	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	when	i	felt	like	 back 	 ing 	 	out	.
but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 revel 	 ations 	 	.
and	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	went	down	to	a	remote	 lag 	 oon 	 	in	australia	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	see	the	earth	the	way	it	was	three	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	back	before	the	sky	 turn 	 ed 	 	blue	.
there	's	 s 	 trom 	 atol 	 ites 	 	down	there	--	the	first	living	 thing 	 s 	 	to	capture	 photo 	 synthesis 	 	--	and	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	they	still	occur	 to 	 day 	 	.
going	down	there	was	like	 enter 	 ing 	 	a	time	 cap 	 sule 	 	,	and	i	came	out	with	a	different	sense	of	 my 	 self 	 	in	time	.
the	oxygen	 exhal 	 ed 	 	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 trom 	 atol 	 ites 	 	is	what	we	all	breathe	 to 	 day 	 	.
 s 	 trom 	 atol 	 ites 	 	are	the	heroes	in	my	story	.
i	hope	it	's	a	story	that	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 reson 	 ance 	 	for	our	time	.
it	's	a	story	about	you	and	me	,	nature	and	science	.
and	with	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	 invit 	 e 	 	you	for	a	short	,	brief	journey	of	life	through	time	.
