let	's	talk	about	past	and	future	 billion 	 s 	 	.
we	know	that	about	106	billion	people	have	ever	lived	.
and	we	know	that	most	of	them	are	dead	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	most	of	them	live	or	lived	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	most	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	or	are	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	--	did	not	live	for	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.
let	's	talk	about	 billion 	 s 	 	.
let	's	talk	about	the	195,000	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	wealth	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	know	that	most	of	that	wealth	was	made	after	the	year	1800	.
and	we	know	that	most	of	it	is	 current 	 ly 	 	owned	by	people	we	might	call	westerners	:	europeans	,	north	americans	,	australasians	.
19	percent	of	the	world	's	population	 to 	 day 	 	,	westerners	own	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	wealth	.
economic	 historian 	 s 	 	call	 th 	 is 	 	``	the	great	 diverge 	 nce 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	slide	here	is	the	best	 simpl 	 ification 	 	of	the	great	 diverge 	 nce 	 	story	i	can	 off 	 er 	 	you	.
it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	two	 ratio 	 s 	 	of	per	capita	gdp	,	per	capita	gross	domestic	product	,	so	average	income	.
one	,	the	red	line	,	is	the	ratio	of	british	to	indian	per	capita	income	.
and	the	blue	line	is	the	ratio	of	american	to	chinese	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	chart	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	1500	.
and	you	can	see	here	that	there	's	an	exponential	great	 diverge 	 nce 	 	.
they	start	off	 pre 	 tty 	 	close	together	.
in	fact	,	in	1500	,	the	average	chinese	was	 rich 	 er 	 	than	the	average	north	american	.
when	you	get	to	the	1970s	,	which	is	where	 th 	 is 	 	chart	 end 	 s 	 	,	the	average	briton	is	more	than	10	 time 	 s 	 	 rich 	 er 	 	than	the	average	indian	.
and	that	's	 allow 	 ing 	 	for	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	the	cost	of	living	.
it	's	based	on	 pur 	 chasing 	 	power	 par 	 ity 	 	.
the	average	american	is	 near 	 ly 	 	20	 time 	 s 	 	 rich 	 er 	 	than	the	average	chinese	by	the	1970s	.
so	why	?
 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	just	an	economic	story	.
if	you	take	the	10	 count 	 ries 	 	that	went	on	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	western	 empire 	 s 	 	,	in	1500	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	--	five	percent	of	the	world	's	land	surface	,	16	percent	of	 it 	 s 	 	population	,	 may 	 be 	 	20	percent	of	 it 	 s 	 	income	.
by	1913	,	these	10	 count 	 ries 	 	,	plus	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	controlled	vast	global	 empire 	 s 	 	--	58	percent	of	the	world	's	 territ 	 ory 	 	,	about	the	same	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	population	,	and	a	 re 	 ally 	 	huge	,	 near 	 ly 	 	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	share	of	global	economic	 out 	 put 	 	.
and	notice	,	most	of	that	went	to	the	 mother 	 land 	 	,	to	the	imperial	 metro 	 pole 	 s 	 	,	not	to	 the 	 ir 	 	colonial	 possess 	 ions 	 	.
now	you	ca	n't	just	blame	 th 	 is 	 	on	 imperial 	 ism 	 	--	 th 	 ough 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	so	--	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
one	,	empire	was	the	 l 	 east 	 	original	thing	that	the	west	did	after	1500	.
 every 	 body 	 	did	empire	.
they	beat	 pre 	 exist 	 ing 	 	 orient 	 al 	 	 empire 	 s 	 	like	the	mughals	and	the	ottomans	.
so	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	empire	is	a	great	 explan 	 ation 	 	for	the	great	 diverge 	 nce 	 	.
in	any	case	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	may	remember	,	the	great	 diverge 	 nce 	 	 reach 	 es 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 zen 	 i 	 th 	 	in	the	1970s	,	some	 consider 	 able 	 	time	after	 de 	 colon 	 ization 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	new	question	.
samuel	johnson	,	the	great	 lexic 	 ographer 	 	,	[	posed	]	it	through	his	character	rasselas	in	his	novel	``	rasselas	,	prince	of	abissinia	,	``	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	1759	.
``	by	what	 mean 	 s 	 	are	the	europeans	thus	 power 	 ful 	 	;	or	why	,	since	they	can	so	 eas 	 ily 	 	visit	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	africa	for	trade	or	 con 	 quest 	 	,	can	not	the	asiaticks	and	africans	 invad 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 coast 	 s 	 	,	plant	 colon 	 ies 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 port 	 s 	 	,	and	give	 law 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	 prince 	 s 	 	?
the	same	wind	that	 car 	 ries 	 	them	back	would	 br 	 ing 	 	us	 t 	 hither 	 	?	``
that	's	a	great	question	.
and	you	know	what	,	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	at	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	same	time	by	the	resterners	--	by	the	people	in	the	rest	of	the	world	--	like	ibrahim	muteferrika	,	an	ottoman	official	,	the	man	who	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 print 	 ing 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 bel 	 ated 	 ly 	 	,	to	the	ottoman	empire	--	who	 s 	 aid 	 	in	a	book	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	1731	,	``	why	do	christian	 nation 	 s 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	so	weak	in	the	past	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	muslim	 nation 	 s 	 	begin	to	dominate	so	 man 	 y 	 	 land 	 s 	 	in	modern	 time 	 s 	 	and	even	defeat	the	once	 vict 	 or 	 ious 	 	ottoman	 arm 	 ies 	 	?	``
 un 	 like 	 	rasselas	,	muteferrika	had	an	answer	to	that	question	,	which	was	correct	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	``	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	 law 	 s 	 	and	 rule 	 s 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	reason	.	``
it	's	not	 geo 	 graphy 	 	.
you	may	think	we	can	explain	the	great	 diverge 	 nce 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 geo 	 graphy 	 	.
we	know	that	's	wrong	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 conduct 	 ed 	 	two	great	natural	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	the	20th	century	to	see	if	 geo 	 graphy 	 	 matter 	 ed 	 	more	than	 institution 	 s 	 	.
we	took	all	the	germans	,	we	 divid 	 ed 	 	them	 rough 	 ly 	 	in	two	,	and	we	 g 	 ave 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	in	the	east	 commun 	 ism 	 	,	and	you	see	the	result	.
 with 	 in 	 	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	short	period	of	time	,	people	living	in	the	german	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 re 	 public 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	trabants	,	the	trabbi	,	one	of	the	world	's	worst	ever	 car 	 s 	 	,	while	people	in	the	west	 produce 	 d 	 	the	mercedes	benz	.
if	you	still	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	we	 conduct 	 ed 	 	the	experiment	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	korean	 pen 	 insula 	 	.
and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	we	'd	take	koreans	in	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	same	 geo 	 graphical 	 	place	with	,	notice	,	the	same	 bas 	 ic 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	culture	,	and	we	 divid 	 ed 	 	them	in	two	,	and	we	 g 	 ave 	 	the	northerners	 commun 	 ism 	 	.
and	the	result	is	an	even	 big 	 ger 	 	 diverge 	 nce 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	space	of	time	than	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	germany	.
not	a	big	 diverge 	 nce 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	uniform	design	for	border	 guard 	 s 	 	 admitted 	 ly 	 	,	but	in	 al 	 most 	 	every	other	respect	,	it	's	a	huge	 diverge 	 nce 	 	.
which	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	think	that	 n 	 either 	 	 geo 	 graphy 	 	nor	national	character	,	popular	 explan 	 ations 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	,	are	 re 	 ally 	 	significant	.
it	's	the	 idea 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	 institution 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	must	be	true	 be 	 cause 	 	a	scotsman	 s 	 aid 	 	it	.
and	i	think	i	'm	the	 on 	 ly 	 	scotsman	here	at	the	edinburgh	ted	.
so	let	me	just	explain	to	you	that	the	 smart 	 est 	 	man	ever	was	a	scotsman	.
he	was	adam	smith	--	not	billy	connolly	,	not	sean	connery	--	 th 	 ough 	 	he	is	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
smith	--	and	i	want	you	to	go	and	bow	down	before	his	statue	in	the	royal	mile	;	it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	statue	--	smith	,	in	the	``	wealth	of	 nation 	 s 	 	``	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	1776	--	that	's	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	that	year	...
you	bet	.
there	was	a	little	local	 difficult 	 y 	 	in	some	of	our	minor	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	but	...
``	 chin 	 a 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	long	 station 	 ary 	 	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	long	ago	 acquir 	 ed 	 	that	full	 comple 	 ment 	 	of	 rich 	 es 	 	which	is	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	the	nature	of	 it 	 s 	 	 law 	 s 	 	and	 institution 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 comple 	 ment 	 	may	be	much	 infer 	 ior 	 	to	what	,	with	other	 law 	 s 	 	and	 institution 	 s 	 	,	the	nature	of	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	,	climate	,	and	 situ 	 ation 	 	might	admit	of	.	``
that	is	so	right	and	so	cool	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	 s 	 uch 	 	a	long	time	ago	.
but	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	ted	audience	,	and	if	i	keep	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 institution 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	to	turn	off	.
so	i	'm	going	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	language	that	you	can	understand	.
let	's	call	them	the	killer	 app 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	explain	to	you	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	six	killer	 app 	 s 	 	that	set	the	west	 a 	 part 	 	from	the	rest	.
and	they	're	kind	of	like	the	 app 	 s 	 	on	your	phone	,	in	the	sense	that	they	look	 quit 	 e 	 	simple	.
they	're	just	 icon 	 s 	 	;	you	click	on	them	.
but	 be 	 hind 	 	the	icon	,	there	's	complex	code	.
it	's	the	same	with	 institution 	 s 	 	.
there	are	six	which	i	think	explain	the	great	 diverge 	 nce 	 	.
one	,	 com 	 petition 	 	.
two	,	the	scientific	revolution	.
three	,	 proper 	 ty 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.
four	,	modern	medicine	.
five	,	the	consumer	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	six	,	the	work	ethic	.
you	can	play	a	game	and	try	and	think	of	one	i	've	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	at	,	or	try	and	boil	it	down	to	just	four	,	but	you	'll	lose	.
let	me	 ver 	 y 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	tell	you	what	i	mean	by	 th 	 is 	 	,	 synth 	 es 	 izing 	 	the	work	of	 man 	 y 	 	economic	 historian 	 s 	 	in	the	process	.
 com 	 petition 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	there	a	hundred	different	 politic 	 al 	 	 unit 	 s 	 	in	europe	in	1500	,	but	 with 	 in 	 	each	of	these	 unit 	 s 	 	,	there	was	 com 	 petition 	 	between	 corporation 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 sovereign 	 s 	 	.
the	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	the	modern	corporation	,	the	city	of	london	corporation	,	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	the	12th	century	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	where	there	was	one	 monolith 	 ic 	 	state	 cover 	 ing 	 	a	fifth	of	 human 	 ity 	 	,	and	 any 	 one 	 	with	any	 ambit 	 ion 	 	had	to	pass	one	 standard 	 ized 	 	examination	,	which	took	three	 day 	 s 	 	and	was	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	and	 involve 	 d 	 	 memor 	 izing 	 	vast	 number 	 s 	 	of	 character 	 s 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	confucian	essay	writing	.
the	scientific	revolution	was	different	from	the	science	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	in	the	 orient 	 al 	 	world	in	a	number	of	 cruci 	 al 	 	ways	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	that	,	through	the	 experiment 	 al 	 	method	,	it	 g 	 ave 	 	men	control	over	nature	in	a	way	that	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	possible	before	.
 ex 	 ample 	 	:	benjamin	 rob 	 in 	 s 	 	's	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	application	of	newtonian	physics	to	 ball 	 istic 	 s 	 	.
once	you	do	that	,	your	 art 	 ille 	 ry 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	accurate	.
think	of	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	.
that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	a	killer	application	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	there	's	no	scientific	revolution	 any 	 where 	 	else	.
the	ottoman	empire	's	not	that	far	from	europe	,	but	there	's	no	scientific	revolution	there	.
in	fact	,	they	demolish	taqi	al-din	's	 observ 	 atory 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 consider 	 ed 	 	 blasphem 	 ous 	 	to	 inquir 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	mind	of	god	.
 proper 	 ty 	 	 right 	 s 	 	:	it	's	not	the	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	 folk 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	rule	of	law	based	on	private	 proper 	 ty 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	north	america	and	south	america	.
you	could	turn	up	in	north	america	 hav 	 ing 	 	 sign 	 ed 	 	a	 de 	 ed 	 	of	indenture	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	'll	work	for	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
you	just	have	to	feed	me	.	``
but	at	the	end	of	it	,	you	've	got	a	hundred	 acre 	 s 	 	of	land	.
that	's	the	land	grant	on	the	bottom	half	of	the	slide	.
that	's	not	possible	in	latin	america	where	land	is	held	onto	by	a	 tin 	 y 	 	elite	 descend 	 ed 	 	from	the	 con 	 qui 	 stad 	 ors 	 	.
and	you	can	see	here	the	huge	 diverge 	 nce 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 proper 	 ty 	 	 owner 	 ship 	 	between	north	and	south	.
most	people	in	 r 	 ural 	 	north	america	owned	some	land	by	1900	.
 hard 	 ly 	 	 any 	 one 	 	in	south	america	did	.
that	's	 an 	 other 	 	killer	app	.
modern	medicine	in	the	late	19th	century	 beg 	 an 	 	to	make	major	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	against	the	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	that	 kill 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	people	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 an 	 other 	 	killer	app	--	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	a	killer	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 double 	 d 	 	,	and	then	more	than	 double 	 d 	 	,	human	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	.
it	even	did	that	in	the	european	 empire 	 s 	 	.
even	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	senegal	,	 begin 	 ning 	 	in	the	early	20th	century	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	major	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	in	public	health	,	and	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	rise	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	rise	any	 fast 	 er 	 	after	these	 count 	 ries 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	.
the	 empire 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	all	bad	.
the	consumer	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	what	you	need	for	the	industrial	revolution	to	have	a	point	.
you	need	people	to	want	to	wear	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 clothe 	 s 	 	.
you	've	all	 b 	 ought 	 	an	article	of	 cloth 	 ing 	 	in	the	last	month	;	i	guarantee	it	.
that	's	the	consumer	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	and	it	 propel 	 s 	 	economic	growth	more	than	even	 techno 	 logical 	 	change	 it 	 self 	 	.
japan	was	the	first	non	-	western	 socie 	 ty 	 	to	embrace	it	.
the	 alter 	 native 	 	,	which	was	 pro 	 posed 	 	by	mahatma	gandhi	,	was	to	 institution 	 al 	 ize 	 	and	make	poverty	permanent	.
 ver 	 y 	 	few	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	 to 	 day 	 	wish	that	india	had	gone	down	mahatma	gandhi	's	road	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	work	ethic	.
max	weber	thought	that	was	 peculiar 	 ly 	 	protestant	.
he	was	wrong	.
any	culture	can	get	the	work	ethic	if	the	 institution 	 s 	 	are	there	to	create	the	incentive	to	work	.
we	know	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 to 	 day 	 	the	work	ethic	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	protestant	,	western	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	west	 ha 	 s 	 	lost	 it 	 s 	 	work	ethic	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	the	average	korean	 work 	 s 	 	a	thousand	 hour 	 s 	 	more	a	year	than	the	average	german	--	a	thousand	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	part	of	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	and	that	is	the	end	of	the	great	 diverge 	 nce 	 	.
who	's	got	the	work	ethic	now	?

why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	killer	 app 	 s 	 	can	be	 download 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	open	source	.
any	 socie 	 ty 	 	can	adopt	these	 institution 	 s 	 	,	and	when	they	do	,	they	 achiev 	 e 	 	what	the	west	 achiev 	 ed 	 	after	1500	--	 on 	 ly 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	.

so	i	want	to	end	with	three	 question 	 s 	 	for	the	future	 billion 	 s 	 	,	just	 a 	 head 	 	of	2016	,	when	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	will	lose	 it 	 s 	 	place	 a 	 s 	 	number	one	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	 chin 	 a 	 	.
the	first	is	,	can	you	delete	these	 app 	 s 	 	,	and	are	we	in	the	process	of	 do 	 ing 	 	so	in	the	western	world	?
the	second	question	is	,	 do 	 es 	 	the	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	of	the	download	matter	?
and	could	africa	get	that	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	wrong	?
one	obvious	 implic 	 ation 	 	of	modern	economic	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	that	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	hard	to	 transit 	 ion 	 	to	 demo 	 cracy 	 	before	you	've	 establish 	 ed 	 	secure	private	 proper 	 ty 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.
 war 	 ning 	 	:	that	may	not	work	.
and	third	,	can	 chin 	 a 	 	do	 with 	 out 	 	killer	app	number	three	?
that	's	the	one	that	john	locke	 system 	 at 	 ized 	 	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 free 	 dom 	 	was	 root 	 ed 	 	in	private	 proper 	 ty 	 	 right 	 s 	 	and	the	 protect 	 ion 	 	of	law	.
that	's	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	the	western	model	of	 represent 	 ative 	 	government	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 show 	 s 	 	the	 demo 	 lit 	 ion 	 	of	the	chinese	artist	ai	weiwei	's	studio	in	shanghai	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
he	's	now	free	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 de 	 tain 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	for	some	time	.
but	i	do	n't	think	his	studio	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 built 	 	.
winston	churchill	once	defined	 civil 	 ization 	 	in	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	he	 g 	 ave 	 	in	the	 fate 	 ful 	 	year	of	1938	.
and	i	think	these	 word 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	nail	it	:	``	it	 mean 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	based	 up 	 on 	 	the	opinion	of	 civil 	 ians 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	violence	,	the	rule	of	 warrior 	 s 	 	and	 de 	 spot 	 ic 	 	 chief 	 s 	 	,	the	 condition 	 s 	 	of	 camp 	 s 	 	and	 war 	 fare 	 	,	of	riot	and	 tyrann 	 y 	 	,	give	place	to	 parliament 	 s 	 	where	 law 	 s 	 	are	made	,	and	 in 	 dependent 	 	 court 	 s 	 	of	justice	in	which	over	long	 period 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 law 	 s 	 	are	 maintain 	 ed 	 	.
that	is	 civil 	 ization 	 	--	and	in	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	grow	 continu 	 ally 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	,	comfort	and	culture	,	``	what	all	tedsters	care	about	most	.
``	when	 civil 	 ization 	 	 reign 	 s 	 	in	any	country	,	a	 wide 	 r 	 	and	less	 harass 	 ed 	 	life	is	 afford 	 ed 	 	to	the	 masse 	 s 	 	of	the	people	.	``
that	's	so	true	.
i	do	n't	think	the	decline	of	western	 civil 	 ization 	 	is	 inevit 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	think	 histo 	 ry 	 	 oper 	 ates 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	life	-	cycle	model	,	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 illustr 	 ated 	 	by	thomas	cole	's	``	course	of	empire	``	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
that	's	not	the	way	 histo 	 ry 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
that	's	not	the	way	the	west	rose	,	and	i	do	n't	think	it	's	the	way	the	west	will	fall	.
the	west	may	collapse	 ver 	 y 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	.
complex	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	do	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 oper 	 ate 	 	,	most	of	the	time	,	on	the	edge	of	 cha 	 os 	 	.
that	's	one	of	the	most	 pro 	 found 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	to	come	out	of	the	 historic 	 al 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	of	complex	 institution 	 s 	 	like	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
no	,	we	may	hang	on	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	huge	 burden 	 s 	 	of	debt	that	we	've	 accumul 	 ated 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	evidence	that	we	've	lost	our	work	ethic	and	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	 historic 	 al 	 	 mo 	 jo 	 	.
but	one	thing	is	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	the	great	 diverge 	 nce 	 	is	over	,	 folk 	 s 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
bruno	giussani	:	niall	,	i	am	just	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	your	take	on	the	other	region	of	the	world	that	's	 boom 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	latin	america	.
what	's	your	view	on	that	?
niall	ferguson	:	well	i	 re 	 ally 	 	am	not	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	rise	of	the	east	;	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	rise	of	the	rest	,	and	that	 include 	 s 	 	south	america	.
i	once	 ask 	 ed 	 	one	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	at	harvard	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	is	south	america	part	of	the	west	?	``
he	was	an	expert	in	latin	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	;	i	'll	have	to	think	about	that	.	``
that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	think	if	you	look	at	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	brazil	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	chile	,	which	was	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	the	one	that	led	the	way	in	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	 institution 	 s 	 	of	economic	life	,	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	future	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
so	my	story	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	much	about	that	 converg 	 ence 	 	in	the	americas	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	a	 converg 	 ence 	 	story	in	eurasia	.
bg	:	and	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	impression	that	north	america	and	europe	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	these	 trend 	 s 	 	.
 most 	 ly 	 	they	're	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	each	other	.
the	americans	think	that	the	european	model	is	going	to	 crumb 	 le 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
the	europeans	think	that	the	american	budget	is	going	to	explode	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
and	that	's	all	we	seem	to	be	 car 	 ing 	 	about	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
nf	:	i	think	the	 fisc 	 al 	 	crisis	that	we	see	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	right	now	--	both	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	atlantic	--	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	taking	different	 form 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 al 	 	culture	.
and	it	's	a	crisis	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	structural	facet	--	it	's	 part 	 ly 	 	to	do	with	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	,	of	course	,	to	do	with	the	massive	crisis	that	 follow 	 ed 	 	 excess 	 ive 	 	leverage	,	 excess 	 ive 	 	 borrow 	 ing 	 	in	the	private	sector	.
that	crisis	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	focus	of	so	much	attention	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	by	me	,	i	think	is	an	 epi 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
the	financial	crisis	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	small	historic	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 accele 	 rated 	 	 th 	 is 	 	huge	shift	,	which	 end 	 s 	 	half	a	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	of	western	 ascend 	 ancy 	 	.
i	think	that	's	 it 	 s 	 	real	 import 	 ance 	 	.
bg	:	niall	,	thank	you	.
