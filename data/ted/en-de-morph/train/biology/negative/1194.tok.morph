 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	by	the	artist	michael	najjar	,	and	it	's	real	,	in	the	sense	that	he	went	there	to	argentina	to	take	the	photo	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	fiction	.	there	's	a	lot	of	work	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	it	after	that	.
and	what	he	's	 d 	 one 	 	is	he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 shaped 	 	,	 digital 	 ly 	 	,	all	of	the	 con 	 tour 	 s 	 	of	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	to	follow	the	 vic 	 issitudes 	 	of	the	dow	jones	index	.
so	what	you	see	,	that	 pre 	 cipice 	 	,	that	high	 pre 	 cipice 	 	with	the	 val 	 ley 	 	,	is	the	2008	financial	crisis	.
the	photo	was	made	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	deep	in	the	 val 	 ley 	 	over	there	.
i	do	n't	know	where	we	are	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	hang	seng	index	for	hong	kong	.
and	similar	 top 	 ography 	 	.
i	wonder	why	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	art	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	metaphor	.
but	i	think	the	point	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	metaphor	with	 tee 	 th 	 	,	and	it	's	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	that	i	want	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	we	 re 	 think 	 	a	little	bit	about	the	role	of	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	math	--	not	just	financial	math	,	but	math	in	general	.
that	 it 	 s 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	 ex 	 tract 	 	and	 der 	 ive 	 	from	the	world	to	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	shape	it	--	the	world	around	us	and	the	world	 in 	 side 	 	us	.
and	it	's	 specific 	 ally 	 	 algorithm 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	math	that	 computer 	 s 	 	use	to	decide	stuff	.
they	 acquir 	 e 	 	the	 sens 	 ibility 	 	of	truth	 be 	 cause 	 	they	repeat	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	they	 os 	 s 	 ify 	 	and	 calc 	 ify 	 	,	and	they	 be 	 come 	 	real	.
and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	all	 place 	 s 	 	,	on	a	transatlantic	flight	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	 seat 	 ed 	 	next	to	a	hungarian	physicist	about	my	age	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	what	life	was	like	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	cold	war	for	 physicist 	 s 	 	in	hungary	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	what	 we 	 re 	 	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	we	 we 	 re 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	 break 	 ing 	 	 steal 	 th 	 	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	a	good	job	.	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	that	work	?	``
and	to	understand	that	,	you	have	to	understand	a	little	bit	about	how	 steal 	 th 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	so	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	over	-	 simpl 	 ification 	 	--	but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	it	's	not	like	you	can	just	pass	a	radar	signal	right	through	156	 ton 	 s 	 	of	steel	in	the	sky	.
it	's	not	just	going	to	disappear	.
but	if	you	can	take	 th 	 is 	 	big	,	massive	thing	,	and	you	could	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	million	little	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	flock	of	 bird 	 s 	 	--	well	then	the	radar	that	's	looking	for	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	see	every	flock	of	 bird 	 s 	 	in	the	sky	.
and	if	you	're	a	radar	,	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	job	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	that	's	if	you	're	a	radar	.
so	we	did	n't	use	a	radar	;	we	built	a	black	box	that	was	looking	for	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	,	 electron 	 ic 	 	communication	.
and	 when 	 ever 	 	we	saw	a	flock	of	 bird 	 s 	 	that	had	 electron 	 ic 	 	communication	,	we	thought	,	'	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	the	americans	.	'	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.
that	's	good	.
so	you	've	 effective 	 ly 	 	 neg 	 ated 	 	60	 year 	 s 	 	of	aeronautic	research	.
what	's	your	act	two	?
what	do	you	do	when	you	grow	up	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	financial	 service 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	news	 late 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	 do 	 es 	 	that	work	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	there	's	2,000	 physicist 	 s 	 	on	wall	street	now	,	and	i	'm	one	of	them	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	the	black	box	for	wall	street	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	funny	you	ask	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	black	box	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 al 	 go 	 	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	part	 be 	 cause 	 	 institution 	 al 	 	 trade 	 rs 	 	have	the	same	 problem 	 s 	 	that	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	air	force	had	,	which	is	that	they	're	moving	these	 position 	 s 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	proctor	&	gamble	or	accenture	,	 what 	 ever 	 	--	they	're	moving	a	million	 share 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	through	the	market	.
and	if	they	do	that	all	at	once	,	it	's	like	 play 	 ing 	 	 poke 	 r 	 	and	going	all	in	right	away	.
you	just	tip	your	hand	.
and	so	they	have	to	find	a	way	--	and	they	use	 algorithm 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	to	break	up	that	big	thing	 in 	 to 	 	a	million	little	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	.
and	the	magic	and	the	 horr 	 or 	 	of	that	is	that	the	same	math	that	you	use	to	break	up	the	big	thing	 in 	 to 	 	a	million	little	 thing 	 s 	 	can	be	used	to	find	a	million	little	 thing 	 s 	 	and	sew	them	back	together	and	figure	out	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	market	.
so	if	you	need	to	have	some	image	of	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	stock	market	right	now	,	what	you	can	picture	is	a	bunch	of	 algorithm 	 s 	 	that	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 programm 	 ed 	 	to	hide	,	and	a	bunch	of	 algorithm 	 s 	 	that	are	 programm 	 ed 	 	to	go	find	them	and	act	.
and	all	of	that	's	great	,	and	it	's	fine	.
and	that	's	70	percent	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	stock	market	,	70	percent	of	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	your	pension	,	your	mortgage	.
and	what	could	go	wrong	?
what	could	go	wrong	is	that	a	year	ago	,	nine	percent	of	the	entire	market	just	 disappear 	 s 	 	in	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	flash	crash	of	2:45	.
all	of	a	sudden	,	nine	percent	just	 go 	 es 	 	away	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	can	even	agree	on	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 order 	 ed 	 	it	,	 no 	 body 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	for	it	.
 no 	 body 	 	had	any	control	over	what	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
all	they	had	was	just	a	monitor	in	front	of	them	that	had	the	 number 	 s 	 	on	it	and	just	a	red	button	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	stop	.	``
and	that	's	the	thing	,	is	that	we	're	writing	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	're	writing	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	no	 long 	 er 	 	read	.
and	we	've	 render 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 il 	 leg 	 ible 	 	,	and	we	've	lost	the	sense	of	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	that	we	've	made	.
and	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	our	way	.
there	's	a	company	in	boston	 call 	 ed 	 	nanex	,	and	they	use	math	and	magic	and	i	do	n't	know	what	,	and	they	reach	 in 	 to 	 	all	the	market	data	and	they	find	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	some	of	these	 algorithm 	 s 	 	.
and	when	they	find	them	they	pull	them	out	and	they	pin	them	to	the	wall	like	 butter 	 flies 	 	.
and	they	do	what	we	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	when	 confront 	 ed 	 	with	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	data	that	we	do	n't	understand	--	which	is	that	they	give	them	a	name	and	a	story	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	that	they	found	,	they	 call 	 ed 	 	the	knife	,	the	carnival	,	the	boston	shuffler	,	 t 	 wi 	 light 	 	.
and	the	 ga 	 g 	 	is	that	,	of	course	,	these	are	n't	just	running	through	the	market	.
you	can	find	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 where 	 ver 	 	you	look	,	once	you	learn	how	to	look	for	them	.
you	can	find	it	here	:	 th 	 is 	 	book	about	flies	that	you	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	on	amazon	.
you	may	have	 notice 	 d 	 	it	when	 it 	 s 	 	price	 start 	 ed 	 	at	1.7	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
it	's	out	of	print	--	still	...
if	you	had	 b 	 ought 	 	it	at	1.7	,	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	 bar 	 gain 	 	.
a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	had	gone	up	to	23.6	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	plus	 ship 	 ping 	 	and	 hand 	 ling 	 	.
and	the	question	is	:	 no 	 body 	 	was	 buy 	 ing 	 	or	selling	 any 	 thing 	 	;	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
and	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	on	amazon	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	it	on	wall	street	.
and	when	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	behavior	,	what	you	see	is	the	evidence	of	 algorithm 	 s 	 	in	conflict	,	 algorithm 	 s 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	 loop 	 s 	 	with	each	other	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	human	 over 	 sight 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	adult	 super 	 vision 	 	to	say	,	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	1.7	million	is	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	with	amazon	,	so	it	is	with	netflix	.
and	so	netflix	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	through	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	different	 algorithm 	 s 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	with	cinematch	,	and	they	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	a	bunch	of	 other 	 s 	 	--	there	's	dinosaur	planet	;	there	's	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
they	're	using	 pragmat 	 ic 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	now	.
 pragmat 	 ic 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	is	,	like	all	of	netflix	 algorithm 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	the	same	thing	.
it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	grasp	on	you	,	on	the	 firm 	 ware 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	human	skull	,	so	that	it	can	recommend	what	movie	you	might	want	to	watch	next	--	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	problem	.
but	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	of	the	problem	and	the	fact	that	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	have	it	down	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	away	from	the	 effect 	 s 	 	 pragmat 	 ic 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	.
 pragmat 	 ic 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	,	like	all	netflix	 algorithm 	 s 	 	,	 determine 	 s 	 	,	in	the	end	,	60	percent	of	what	 movie 	 s 	 	end	up	 be 	 ing 	 	 rent 	 ed 	 	.
so	one	piece	of	code	with	one	idea	about	you	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	60	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	.
but	what	if	you	could	rate	 t 	 hose 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	before	they	get	made	?
would	n't	that	be	 hand 	 y 	 	?
well	,	a	few	data	 scientist 	 s 	 	from	the	u.k.	are	in	hollywood	,	and	they	have	``	story	 algorithm 	 s 	 	``	--	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	epagogix	.
and	you	can	run	your	script	through	there	,	and	they	can	tell	you	,	 quant 	 ifiably 	 	,	that	that	's	a	30	million	dollar	movie	or	a	200	million	dollar	movie	.
and	the	thing	is	,	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	google	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	information	.
these	are	n't	financial	 stat 	 s 	 	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	culture	.
and	what	you	see	here	,	or	what	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	see	 normal 	 ly 	 	,	is	that	these	are	the	physics	of	culture	.
and	if	these	 algorithm 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 algorithm 	 s 	 	on	wall	street	,	just	 crash 	 ed 	 	one	day	and	went	 a 	 wry 	 	,	how	would	we	know	?
what	would	it	look	like	?
and	they	're	in	your	house	.	they	're	in	your	house	.
these	are	two	 algorithm 	 s 	 	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	for	your	living	room	.
these	are	two	different	 clean 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	that	have	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 idea 	 s 	 	about	what	clean	 mean 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	see	it	if	you	 s 	 low 	 	it	down	and	attach	 light 	 s 	 	to	them	,	and	they	're	sort	of	like	secret	 architect 	 s 	 	in	your	 bed 	 room 	 	.
and	the	idea	that	 architect 	 ure 	 	 it 	 self 	 	is	 some 	 how 	 	subject	to	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	 optim 	 ization 	 	is	not	far	-	 fetch 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	super	-	real	and	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	around	you	.
you	feel	it	most	when	you	're	in	a	 seal 	 ed 	 	metal	box	,	a	new	-	style	 elev 	 ator 	 	;	they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	destination	-	control	 elev 	 ators 	 	.
these	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	where	you	have	to	press	what	floor	you	're	going	to	go	to	before	you	get	in	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	.
and	it	uses	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	bin	-	 pack 	 ing 	 	algorithm	.
so	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 mis 	 he 	 gas 	 	of	 lett 	 ing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	go	 in 	 to 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	car	they	want	.
 every 	 body 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	go	to	the	10th	floor	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	car	two	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	go	to	the	third	floor	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	car	five	.
and	the	problem	with	that	is	that	people	freak	out	.
people	panic	.
and	you	see	why	.	you	see	why	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	is	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	some	 import 	 ant 	 	 instrument 	 ation 	 	,	like	the	 button 	 s 	 	.
like	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	use	.
all	it	 ha 	 s 	 	is	just	the	number	that	 move 	 s 	 	up	or	down	and	that	red	button	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	stop	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	for	.
we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	machine	dialect	.
and	how	far	can	you	take	that	?	how	far	can	you	take	it	?
you	can	take	it	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	far	.
so	let	me	take	it	back	to	wall	street	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 algorithm 	 s 	 	of	wall	street	are	dependent	on	one	quality	above	all	else	,	which	is	speed	.
and	they	 oper 	 ate 	 	on	 milli 	 second 	 s 	 	and	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	.
and	just	to	give	you	a	sense	of	what	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	are	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	you	500,000	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	just	to	click	a	mouse	.
but	if	you	're	a	wall	street	algorithm	and	you	're	five	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	,	you	're	a	 lose 	 r 	 	.
so	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	an	algorithm	,	you	'd	look	for	an	architect	like	the	one	that	i	met	in	frankfurt	who	was	 hollow 	 ing 	 	out	a	 sky 	 scrap 	 er 	 	--	 throw 	 ing 	 	out	all	the	furniture	,	all	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	for	human	use	,	and	just	running	steel	on	the	 floor 	 s 	 	to	get	ready	for	the	 stack 	 s 	 	of	 serv 	 ers 	 	to	go	in	--	all	so	an	algorithm	could	get	close	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	you	think	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 distribut 	 ed 	 	system	.
and	of	course	,	it	is	,	but	it	's	 distribut 	 ed 	 	from	 place 	 s 	 	.
in	new	york	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	it	's	 distribut 	 ed 	 	from	:	the	 car 	 rier 	 	hotel	 locate 	 d 	 	on	hudson	street	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	where	the	 wire 	 s 	 	come	right	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	city	.
and	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	the	further	away	you	are	from	that	,	you	're	a	few	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	every	time	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	down	on	wall	street	,	marco	polo	and	cherokee	nation	,	they	're	eight	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	all	these	 guy 	 s 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	empty	 building 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 hollow 	 ed 	 	out	up	around	the	 car 	 rier 	 	hotel	.
and	that	's	going	to	keep	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	going	to	keep	 hollow 	 ing 	 	them	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	,	inch	for	inch	and	pound	for	pound	and	dollar	for	dollar	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	you	could	 squeez 	 e 	 	revenue	out	of	that	space	like	the	boston	shuffler	could	.
but	if	you	zoom	out	,	if	you	zoom	out	,	you	would	see	an	825	-	mile	trench	between	new	york	city	and	chicago	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	built	over	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	by	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	spread	 network 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fiber	optic	cable	that	was	laid	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	cities	to	just	be	able	to	traffic	one	signal	37	 time 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	you	can	click	a	mouse	--	just	for	these	 algorithm 	 s 	 	,	just	for	the	carnival	and	the	knife	.
and	when	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	we	're	running	through	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	with	 dynam 	 ite 	 	and	rock	 saw 	 s 	 	so	that	an	algorithm	can	close	the	deal	three	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	,	all	for	a	 communication 	 s 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	that	no	human	will	ever	know	,	that	's	a	kind	of	manifest	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	;	and	we	'll	 al 	 ways 	 	look	for	a	new	 front 	 ier 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	our	work	cut	out	for	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 theoretic 	 al 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	at	mit	.
and	the	truth	is	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	a	lot	of	what	they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
it	 involve 	 s 	 	light	 con 	 es 	 	and	 quant 	 um 	 	 entangle 	 ment 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	any	of	that	.
but	i	can	read	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	and	what	 th 	 is 	 	map	 say 	 s 	 	is	that	,	if	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	money	on	the	 market 	 s 	 	where	the	red	 dot 	 s 	 	are	,	that	's	where	people	are	,	where	the	cities	are	,	you	're	going	to	have	to	put	the	 serv 	 ers 	 	where	the	blue	 dot 	 s 	 	are	to	do	that	most	 effective 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	thing	that	you	might	have	 notice 	 d 	 	about	 t 	 hose 	 	blue	 dot 	 s 	 	is	that	a	lot	of	them	are	in	the	middle	of	the	ocean	.
so	that	's	what	we	'll	do	:	we	'll	build	 bubble 	 s 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	or	 platform 	 s 	 	.
we	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	part	the	water	to	pull	money	out	of	the	air	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	bright	future	if	you	're	an	algorithm	.
and	it	's	not	the	money	that	's	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	what	the	money	 motiv 	 ates 	 	,	that	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 terra 	 form 	 ing 	 	the	earth	 it 	 self 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	efficiency	.
and	in	that	light	,	you	go	back	and	you	look	at	michael	najjar	's	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	and	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	they	're	not	metaphor	,	they	're	 prop 	 he 	 cy 	 	.
they	're	 prop 	 he 	 cy 	 	for	the	kind	of	 s 	 e 	 ism 	 ic 	 	,	terrestrial	 effect 	 s 	 	of	the	math	that	we	're	making	.
and	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	was	 al 	 ways 	 	made	by	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	weird	,	 un 	 easy 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	between	nature	and	man	.
but	now	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	third	co	-	 evolution 	 ary 	 	force	:	 algorithm 	 s 	 	--	the	boston	shuffler	,	the	carnival	.
and	we	will	have	to	understand	 t 	 hose 	 	 a 	 s 	 	nature	,	and	in	a	way	,	they	are	.
thank	you	.
