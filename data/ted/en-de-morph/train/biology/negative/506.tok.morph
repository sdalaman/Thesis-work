one	thing	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	about	film	making	is	--	about	 th 	 is 	 	film	--	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	some	of	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	here	,	michael	moschen	,	and	some	of	the	 talk 	 s 	 	about	music	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	there	is	a	narrative	line	,	and	that	music	 exist 	 s 	 	in	time	.
a	film	 al 	 so 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	in	time	;	it	's	an	experience	that	you	should	go	through	 emotion 	 ally 	 	.
and	in	making	 th 	 is 	 	film	i	felt	that	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 document 	 aries 	 	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	about	 learn 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	or	knowledge	,	or	driven	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,	and	driven	by	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	film	to	be	driven	by	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	to	follow	my	journey	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 talk 	 ing 	 	head	thing	,	 in 	 stead 	 	it	's	 compose 	 d 	 	of	 scene 	 s 	 	,	and	we	meet	people	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
we	 on 	 ly 	 	meet	them	once	.
they	do	n't	come	back	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	so	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 chronic 	 les 	 	a	journey	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	like	life	,	that	once	you	get	in	it	you	ca	n't	get	out	.
there	are	two	 clip 	 s 	 	i	want	to	show	you	,	the	first	one	is	a	kind	of	hodgepodge	,	 it 	 s 	 	just	three	little	 moment 	 s 	 	,	four	little	 moment 	 s 	 	with	three	of	the	people	who	are	here	 to 	 night 	 	.
it	's	not	the	way	they	occur	in	the	film	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	part	of	much	 large 	 r 	 	 scene 	 s 	 	.
they	play	off	each	other	in	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	.
and	that	 end 	 s 	 	with	a	little	clip	of	my	father	,	of	lou	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	dear	to	him	,	which	is	the	 accident 	 s 	 	of	life	.
i	think	he	felt	that	the	 great 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	life	 we 	 re 	 	 accident 	 al 	 	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	 plan 	 ned 	 	at	all	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 clip 	 s 	 	will	be	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	a	scene	of	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	what	,	to	me	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	his	 great 	 est 	 	building	which	is	a	building	in	dhaka	,	bangladesh	.
he	built	the	capital	over	there	.
and	i	think	you	'll	enjoy	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	it	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	--	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	still	 photograph 	 ed 	 	,	but	never	 photograph 	 ed 	 	by	a	film	crew	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	film	crew	in	there	.
so	you	'll	see	 image 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	building	.
a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	keep	in	mind	when	you	see	it	,	it	was	built	 entire 	 ly 	 	by	hand	,	i	think	they	got	a	 cr 	 ane 	 	the	last	year	.
it	was	built	 entire 	 ly 	 	by	hand	off	bamboo	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	,	people	 carry 	 ing 	 	these	 basket 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,	 dump 	 ing 	 	them	in	the	 form 	 s 	 	.
it	is	the	capital	of	the	country	,	and	it	took	23	 year 	 s 	 	to	build	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	they	seem	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	over	there	.
it	took	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	the	taj	mahal	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	it	took	so	long	that	lou	never	saw	it	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
he	 di 	 ed 	 	in	1974	.
the	building	was	 finish 	 ed 	 	in	1983	.
so	it	 continu 	 ed 	 	on	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	after	he	 di 	 ed 	 	.
think	about	that	when	you	see	that	building	,	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 striv 	 e 	 	for	so	hard	in	life	we	never	get	to	see	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	me	about	my	father	,	in	the	sense	that	he	had	 s 	 uch 	 	belief	that	 some 	 how 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	giving	in	the	way	that	he	 g 	 ave 	 	,	that	 some 	 thing 	 	good	would	come	out	of	it	,	even	in	the	middle	of	a	war	,	there	was	a	war	with	pakistan	at	one	point	,	and	the	construction	 stop 	 ped 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	and	he	 ke 	 pt 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	felt	,	``	well	when	the	war	is	 d 	 one 	 	they	'll	need	 th 	 is 	 	building	.	``
so	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	two	 clip 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	.
roll	that	tape	.
richard	saul	wurman	:	i	remember	 hear 	 ing 	 	him	talk	at	penn	.
and	i	came	home	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	my	father	and	mother	,	``	i	just	met	 th 	 is 	 	man	:	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	much	work	,	and	he	's	sort	of	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	funny	voice	,	and	he	's	a	teacher	at	school	.
i	know	you	've	never	heard	of	him	,	but	just	mark	 th 	 is 	 	day	that	 some 	 day 	 	you	will	hear	of	him	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	man	.	``
frank	gehry	:	i	heard	he	had	some	kind	of	a	 fl 	 ing 	 	with	ingrid	bergman	.	is	that	true	?
nathaniel	kahn	:	if	he	did	he	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	man	.
nk	:	did	you	hear	that	,	 re 	 ally 	 	?
fg	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	when	he	was	in	rome	.
moshe	safdie	:	he	was	a	real	nomad	.
and	you	know	,	when	i	 k 	 new 	 	him	when	i	was	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	,	he	would	come	in	from	a	trip	,	and	he	would	be	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	for	two	or	three	 day 	 s 	 	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	,	and	he	would	pack	up	and	go	.
you	know	he	'd	be	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	till	three	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	us	and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	sense	of	the	nomad	in	him	.
i	mean	 a 	 s 	 	tragic	 a 	 s 	 	his	death	was	in	a	 rail 	 way 	 	station	,	it	was	so	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	his	life	,	you	know	?
i	mean	i	often	think	i	'm	going	to	die	in	a	plane	,	or	i	'm	going	to	die	in	an	 air 	 port 	 	,	or	die	 jog 	 ging 	 	 with 	 out 	 	an	 ident 	 ification 	 	on	me	.
i	do	n't	know	why	i	sort	of	carry	that	from	that	 memor 	 y 	 	of	the	way	he	 di 	 ed 	 	.
but	he	was	a	sort	of	a	nomad	at	heart	.
louis	kahn	:	how	 accident 	 al 	 	our	 exist 	 ence 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	and	how	full	of	influence	by	 circum 	 stance 	 	.
man	:	we	are	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	who	come	,	all	the	time	,	here	and	enjoy	the	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	city	's	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	the	atmosphere	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 nic 	 est 	 	place	of	bangladesh	.
we	are	proud	of	it	.
nk	:	you	're	proud	of	it	?
man	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	is	the	national	image	of	bangladesh	.
nk	:	do	you	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	architect	?
man	:	architect	?	i	've	heard	about	him	;	he	's	a	top	-	 rank 	 ing 	 	architect	.
nk	:	well	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	'm	here	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	the	architect	's	son	,	he	was	my	father	.
man	:	oh	!	dad	is	louis	farrakhan	?
nk	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	no	not	louis	farrakhan	,	louis	kahn	.
man	:	louis	kahn	,	 y 	 es 	 	!
man	:	your	father	,	is	he	 al 	 ive 	 	?
nk	:	no	,	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	dead	for	25	 year 	 s 	 	.
man	:	 ver 	 y 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	welcome	you	back	.
nk	:	thank	you	.
nk	:	he	never	saw	it	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	pop	.
no	,	he	never	saw	 th 	 is 	 	.
shamsul	wares	:	it	was	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	,	building	for	a	country	like	 our 	 s 	 	.
in	30	,	50	 year 	 s 	 	back	,	it	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 padd 	 y 	 	 field 	 s 	 	,	and	since	we	 invit 	 ed 	 	him	here	,	he	felt	that	he	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	moses	here	,	he	 g 	 ave 	 	us	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
he	is	not	a	 politic 	 al 	 	man	,	but	in	 th 	 is 	 	guise	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	the	institution	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	from	where	we	can	rise	.
in	that	way	it	is	so	relevant	.
he	did	n't	care	for	how	much	money	 th 	 is 	 	country	 ha 	 s 	 	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	he	would	be	able	to	ever	finish	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	it	,	build	it	,	here	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	largest	project	he	 ha 	 s 	 	got	in	here	,	the	 poor 	 est 	 	country	in	the	world	.
nk	:	it	cost	him	his	life	.
sw	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	he	paid	.	he	paid	his	life	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	that	is	why	he	is	great	and	we	'll	remember	him	.
but	he	was	 al 	 so 	 	human	.
now	his	failure	to	satisfy	the	family	life	,	is	an	 inevit 	 able 	 	 associ 	 ation 	 	of	great	people	.
but	i	think	his	son	will	understand	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	will	have	no	sense	of	grudge	,	or	sense	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 neglect 	 ed 	 	,	i	think	.
he	 car 	 ed 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	manner	,	but	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	time	to	understand	that	.
in	social	 a 	 spect 	 	of	his	life	he	was	just	like	a	child	,	he	was	not	at	all	 matur 	 ed 	 	.
he	could	not	say	no	to	 any 	 thing 	 	,	and	that	is	why	,	that	he	can	not	say	no	to	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	got	 th 	 is 	 	building	 to 	 day 	 	.
you	see	,	 on 	 ly 	 	that	way	you	can	be	able	to	understand	him	.
there	is	no	other	 short 	 cut 	 	,	no	other	way	to	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	him	.
but	i	think	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	building	and	we	feel	all	the	time	for	him	,	that	's	why	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	love	for	us	.
he	could	not	 prob 	 ably 	 	give	the	right	kind	of	love	for	you	,	but	for	us	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	the	people	the	right	kind	of	love	,	that	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
you	have	to	understand	that	.
he	had	an	enormous	amount	of	love	,	he	 love 	 d 	 	 every 	 body 	 	.
to	love	 every 	 body 	 	,	he	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	did	not	see	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 st 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	 inevit 	 able 	 	for	men	of	his	 st 	 ature 	 	.
