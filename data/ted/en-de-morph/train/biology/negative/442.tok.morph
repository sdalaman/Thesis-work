i	 be 	 came 	 	an	inventor	by	accident	.
i	was	out	of	the	air	force	in	1956	.	no	,	no	,	that	's	not	true	:	i	went	in	in	1956	,	came	out	in	1959	,	was	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	university	of	washington	,	and	i	came	up	with	an	idea	,	from	 read 	 ing 	 	a	magazine	article	,	for	a	new	kind	of	a	 phon 	 o 	 graph 	 	tone	arm	.
now	,	that	was	before	cassette	 tape 	 s 	 	,	c.	d.	s	,	dvds	--	any	of	the	cool	stuff	we	've	got	now	.
and	it	was	an	arm	that	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 h 	 ing 	 ing 	 	and	 pivot 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	went	 a 	 cross 	 	the	record	,	went	straight	:	a	 radi 	 al 	 	,	linear	 track 	 ing 	 	tone	arm	.
and	it	was	the	 hard 	 est 	 	 invent 	 ion 	 	i	ever	made	,	but	it	got	me	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	after	that	.
and	 with 	 out 	 	giving	you	too	much	of	a	tirade	,	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	an	 invent 	 ion 	 	i	 br 	 ought 	 	with	me	 to 	 day 	 	:	my	44th	 invent 	 ion 	 	.	no	,	that	's	not	true	either	.
 go 	 lly 	 	,	i	'm	just	 total 	 ly 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	it	.
my	44th	patent	;	about	the	15th	 invent 	 ion 	 	.
i	call	 th 	 is 	 	 hyper 	 sonic 	 	sound	.
i	'm	going	to	play	it	for	you	in	a	couple	 minute 	 s 	 	,	but	i	want	to	make	an	 analog 	 y 	 	before	i	do	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 usual 	 ly 	 	show	 th 	 is 	 	 hyper 	 sonic 	 	sound	and	people	will	say	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	,	but	what	's	it	good	for	?
and	i	say	,	what	is	the	light	bulb	good	for	?
sound	,	light	:	i	'm	going	to	draw	the	 analog 	 y 	 	.
when	edison	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	light	bulb	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	that	much	.
light	came	out	of	it	in	every	direction	.
before	the	light	bulb	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	people	had	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	put	a	 reflect 	 or 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	it	,	focus	it	a	little	bit	;	put	 lens 	 es 	 	in	front	of	it	,	focus	it	a	little	bit	better	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 laser 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	focused	.
now	,	think	about	where	the	world	would	be	 to 	 day 	 	if	we	had	the	light	bulb	,	but	you	could	n't	focus	light	;	if	when	you	 turn 	 ed 	 	one	on	it	just	went	 where 	 ver 	 	it	 want 	 ed 	 	to	.
that	's	the	way	 loud 	 speaker 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	are	.
you	turn	on	the	 loud 	 speaker 	 	,	and	after	 al 	 most 	 	80	 year 	 s 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 gadget 	 s 	 	,	the	sound	just	kind	of	 go 	 es 	 	where	it	 want 	 s 	 	.
even	when	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	a	 mega 	 phone 	 	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	every	direction	.
a	little	bit	of	 different 	 ial 	 	,	but	not	much	.
if	the	light	bulb	was	the	way	the	speaker	is	,	and	you	could	n't	focus	or	 sharp 	 en 	 	the	 edge 	 s 	 	or	define	it	,	we	would	n't	have	that	,	or	 movie 	 s 	 	in	general	,	or	 computer 	 s 	 	,	or	t.v	.	 set 	 s 	 	,	or	c.	d.	s	,	or	dvds	--	and	just	go	down	the	list	of	what	the	 import 	 ance 	 	is	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	focus	light	.
now	,	after	 al 	 most 	 	80	 year 	 s 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	sound	,	i	thought	it	was	about	time	that	we	figure	out	a	way	to	put	sound	where	you	want	to	.
i	have	a	couple	of	 unit 	 s 	 	.
that	guy	there	was	made	for	a	demo	i	did	 yester 	 day 	 	early	in	the	day	for	a	big	car	maker	in	detroit	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	put	them	in	a	car	--	small	version	,	over	your	head	--	so	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 bin 	 a 	 ural 	 	sound	in	a	car	.
what	if	i	could	aim	sound	the	way	i	aim	light	?
i	got	 th 	 is 	 	 water 	 fall 	 	i	 record 	 ed 	 	in	my	back	yard	.
now	,	you	're	not	going	to	hear	a	thing	 un 	 less 	 	it	 hit 	 s 	 	you	.
 may 	 be 	 	if	i	hit	the	side	wall	it	will	 bounc 	 e 	 	around	the	room	.
the	sound	is	 be 	 ing 	 	made	right	next	to	your	 ear 	 s 	 	.	is	that	cool	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	some	 limit 	 ed 	 	time	,	i	'll	cut	it	off	for	a	second	,	and	tell	you	about	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	and	what	it	's	good	for	.
course	,	like	light	,	it	's	great	to	be	able	to	put	sound	to	 high 	 light 	 	a	 cloth 	 ing 	 	rack	,	or	the	 corn 	 flake 	 s 	 	,	or	the	 tooth 	 paste 	 	,	or	a	 talk 	 ing 	 	 pla 	 que 	 	in	a	movie	theater	lobby	.
sony	's	got	an	idea	--	sony	's	our	 big 	 gest 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	right	now	.
they	 tri 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	back	in	the	'60s	and	 we 	 re 	 	too	smart	,	and	so	they	 g 	 ave 	 	up	.
but	they	want	to	use	it	--	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
there	's	a	mix	an	inventor	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	.
you	have	to	be	kind	of	smart	,	and	 th 	 ough 	 	i	did	not	graduate	from	college	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	i	'm	stupid	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	not	be	stupid	and	do	 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
too	 man 	 y 	 	other	smart	people	out	there	.	so	.
i	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	get	my	education	in	a	little	different	way	.
i	'm	not	at	all	against	education	.
i	think	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	;	i	think	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	,	when	they	get	educated	,	lose	it	:	they	get	so	smart	they	're	 un 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	know	better	than	.
and	we	're	living	in	a	great	time	right	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 explore 	 d 	 	 a 	 new 	 	.
i	have	 th 	 is 	 	little	slogan	that	i	use	a	lot	,	which	is	:	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	--	and	i	mean	 th 	 is 	 	 honest 	 ly 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	yet	.
we	're	just	 start 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	just	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	discover	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	nature	and	science	and	physics	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	i	hope	,	a	little	piece	of	it	.
sony	's	got	 th 	 is 	 	vision	back	--	to	get	 my 	 self 	 	on	track	--	that	when	you	stand	in	the	 check 	 out 	 	line	in	the	 super 	 market 	 	,	you	're	going	to	watch	a	new	t.v	.	channel	.
they	know	that	when	you	watch	t.v	.	at	home	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	you	can	change	 channel 	 s 	 	,	 mis 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 commercial 	 s 	 	.
a	hundred	and	fifty	-	one	million	people	every	day	stand	in	the	line	at	the	 super 	 market 	 	.
now	,	they	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	it	 fail 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 check 	 er 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 hear 	 ing 	 	the	same	 mess 	 age 	 	every	20	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	 reach 	 es 	 	out	,	 turn 	 s 	 	off	the	sound	.
and	,	you	know	,	if	the	sound	is	n't	there	,	the	sale	 typical 	 ly 	 	is	n't	made	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	like	,	when	you	're	on	an	 air 	 plane 	 	,	they	show	the	movie	,	you	get	to	watch	it	for	free	;	when	you	want	to	hear	the	sound	,	you	pay	.
and	so	abc	and	sony	have	 de 	 vis 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	thing	where	when	you	step	in	the	line	in	the	 super 	 market 	 	--	 initi 	 ally 	 	it	'll	be	safeways	.	it	is	safeways	;	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	three	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	country	right	now	--	you	'll	be	 watch 	 ing 	 	tv	.
and	 hope 	 fully 	 	they	'll	be	sensitive	that	they	do	n't	want	to	offend	you	with	just	one	more	 out 	 let 	 	.
but	what	's	great	about	it	,	from	the	 test 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	is	,	if	you	do	n't	want	to	hear	it	,	you	take	about	one	step	to	the	side	and	you	do	n't	hear	it	.
so	,	we	create	silence	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	create	sound	.
atms	that	talk	to	you	;	 no 	 body 	 	else	 hear 	 s 	 	it	.
 s 	 it 	 	in	bed	,	two	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	watch	tv	;	your	spouse	,	or	 some 	 one 	 	,	is	next	to	you	,	 a 	 sleep 	 	;	 do 	 es 	 	n't	hear	it	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	wake	up	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	noise	 cancel 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 s 	 nor 	 ing 	 	,	noise	from	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	.
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	technology	:	all	of	a	sudden	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	ready	,	the	world	is	ready	to	accept	it	.
they	have	 liter 	 ally 	 	beat	a	path	to	our	door	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	selling	it	since	about	last	september	,	october	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 immense 	 ly 	 	 grat 	 ifying 	 	.
if	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	what	it	 cost 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	not	selling	them	 to 	 day 	 	--	but	 th 	 is 	 	unit	,	with	the	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	if	you	buy	one	,	is	around	a	thousand	 buck 	 s 	 	.
we	expect	by	 th 	 is 	 	time	next	year	,	it	'll	be	 hundred 	 s 	 	,	a	few	hundred	 buck 	 s 	 	,	to	buy	it	.
it	's	not	any	more	 price 	 y 	 	than	regular	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
now	,	when	i	 play 	 ed 	 	it	for	you	,	you	did	n't	hear	the	 thunder 	 ous 	 	 bas 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	unit	that	i	 play 	 ed 	 	 go 	 es 	 	from	about	200	hertz	to	above	the	range	of	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 emit 	 ting 	 	 ultra 	 sound 	 	--	low	-	level	 ultra 	 sound 	 	--	that	's	about	100,000	 vibration 	 s 	 	per	second	.
and	the	sound	that	you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	 un 	 like 	 	a	regular	speaker	on	which	all	the	sound	is	made	on	the	face	,	is	made	out	in	front	of	it	,	in	the	air	.
the	air	is	not	linear	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taught	.
you	turn	up	the	volume	just	a	little	bit	--	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	little	over	80	 decibel 	 s 	 	--	and	all	of	a	sudden	the	air	 begin 	 s 	 	to	corrupt	 signal 	 s 	 	you	 propag 	 ate 	 	.
here	's	why	:	the	speed	of	sound	is	not	a	constant	.	it	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	 s 	 low 	 	.
it	 change 	 s 	 	with	temperature	and	with	 baro 	 metric 	 	pressure	.
now	,	imagine	,	if	you	will	,	 with 	 out 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	too	technical	,	i	'm	making	a	little	 s 	 ine 	 	wave	here	in	the	air	.
well	,	if	i	turn	up	the	 ampl 	 itude 	 	too	much	,	i	'm	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	effect	on	the	pressure	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	making	of	that	 s 	 ine 	 	wave	,	the	speed	at	which	it	is	 propag 	 ating 	 	is	shifting	.
all	of	audio	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	is	an	attempt	to	be	more	and	more	 perfect 	 ly 	 	linear	.
 linear 	 ity 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 high 	 er 	 	quality	sound	.
 hyper 	 sonic 	 	sound	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	:	it	's	100	percent	based	on	non	-	 linear 	 ity 	 	.
an	effect	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	air	,	it	's	a	 corrupt 	 ing 	 	effect	of	the	sound	--	the	 ultra 	 sound 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	--	that	's	 emit 	 ted 	 	,	but	it	's	so	 predict 	 able 	 	that	you	can	produce	 ver 	 y 	 	precise	audio	out	of	that	effect	.
now	,	the	question	is	,	where	's	the	sound	made	?
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	made	on	the	face	of	the	 con 	 e 	 	,	it	's	made	at	 liter 	 ally 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	little	 in 	 dependent 	 	 point 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	narrow	column	in	the	air	,	and	so	when	i	aim	it	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	you	,	what	you	hear	is	made	right	next	to	your	 ear 	 s 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	we	can	 short 	 en 	 	the	column	,	we	can	spread	it	out	to	cover	the	couch	.
i	can	put	it	so	that	one	ear	 hear 	 s 	 	one	speaker	,	the	other	ear	 hear 	 s 	 	the	other	.	that	's	true	 bin 	 a 	 ural 	 	sound	.
when	you	listen	to	stereo	on	your	home	system	,	your	both	 ear 	 s 	 	hear	both	 speaker 	 s 	 	.
turn	on	the	left	speaker	 some 	 time 	 	and	notice	you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	it	 al 	 so 	 	in	your	right	ear	.
so	,	the	stage	is	more	 restrict 	 ed 	 	--	the	sound	stage	that	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	spread	out	in	front	of	you	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	sound	is	made	in	the	air	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	column	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	follow	the	 in 	 verse 	 	square	law	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	it	 drop 	 s 	 	off	about	two	 third 	 s 	 	every	time	you	double	the	distance	:	6db	every	time	you	go	from	one	meter	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	to	two	 meter 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	you	go	to	a	rock	concert	or	a	 sym 	 phony 	 	,	and	the	guy	in	the	front	row	 get 	 s 	 	the	same	level	 a 	 s 	 	the	guy	in	the	back	row	,	now	,	all	of	a	sudden	.
is	n't	that	 terr 	 ific 	 	?
so	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	,	in	 hav 	 ing 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	catch	the	vision	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	from	 car 	 s 	 	--	car	makers	who	want	to	put	a	stereo	system	in	the	front	for	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	a	 separat 	 e 	 	system	in	the	back	--	oh	,	no	,	the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	n't	 driv 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	was	 see 	 ing 	 	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	have	n't	had	 break 	 fast 	 	yet	.
a	stereo	system	in	the	front	for	mom	and	dad	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	there	's	a	little	dvd	player	in	the	back	for	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 parent 	 s 	 	do	n't	want	to	be	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	with	that	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	rap	music	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
so	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	put	sound	 any 	 where 	 	you	want	to	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	catch	on	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 s 	 	for	 transmit 	 ting 	 	and	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	data	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 s 	 	five	 time 	 s 	 	better	 under 	 water 	 	.
we	've	got	the	 militar 	 y 	 	--	have	just	 deploy 	 ed 	 	some	of	these	 in 	 to 	 	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	where	you	can	put	fake	troop	 move 	 ments 	 	quarter	of	a	mile	away	on	a	 hill 	 side 	 	.
or	you	can	whisper	in	the	ear	of	a	 suppose 	 d 	 	terrorist	some	biblical	verse	.
i	'm	serious	.	and	they	have	these	 infra 	 red 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	can	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 count 	 en 	 ance 	 	,	and	see	a	fraction	of	a	degree	kelvin	in	temperature	shift	from	100	 yard 	 s 	 	away	when	they	play	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
and	so	,	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 hope 	 fully 	 	 determi 	 ning 	 	who	's	friendly	and	who	is	n't	.
we	make	a	version	with	 th 	 is 	 	which	 put 	 s 	 	out	155	 decibel 	 s 	 	.
pain	is	120	.
so	it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	go	 near 	 ly 	 	a	mile	away	and	communicate	with	people	,	and	there	can	be	a	public	beach	just	off	to	the	side	,	and	they	do	n't	even	know	it	's	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	.
we	sell	 t 	 hose 	 	to	the	 militar 	 y 	 	 present 	 ly 	 	for	about	70,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 buy 	 ing 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	make	them	.
we	put	it	on	a	 tur 	 ret 	 	with	a	camera	,	so	that	when	they	shoot	at	you	,	you	're	over	there	,	and	it	's	there	.
i	have	a	bunch	of	other	 invent 	 ions 	 	.
i	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	plasma	antenna	,	to	shift	 gear 	 s 	 	.
 look 	 ed 	 	up	at	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	of	my	 off 	 ice 	 	one	day	--	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	ground	-	 penet 	 rating 	 	radar	project	--	and	my	physicist	ceo	came	in	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	have	a	real	problem	.
we	're	using	 ver 	 y 	 	short	 wave 	 length 	 s 	 	.
we	've	got	a	problem	with	the	antenna	 ring 	 ing 	 	.
when	you	run	 ver 	 y 	 	short	 wave 	 length 	 s 	 	,	like	a	 t 	 un 	 ing 	 	 for 	 k 	 	the	antenna	 reson 	 ates 	 	,	and	there	's	more	energy	coming	out	of	the	antenna	than	there	is	the	 back 	 scatter 	 	from	the	ground	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	,	taking	too	much	 process 	 ing 	 	.	``
i	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	we	make	an	antenna	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	when	you	want	it	?
turn	it	on	;	turn	it	off	.
that	's	a	fluorescent	tube	 refine 	 d 	 	.	``
i	just	 s 	 old 	 	that	for	a	million	and	a	half	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	cash	.
