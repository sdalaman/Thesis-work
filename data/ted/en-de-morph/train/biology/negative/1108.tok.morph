adrian	kohler	:	well	,	we	're	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	talk	about	the	evolution	of	a	puppet	horse	.
basil	jones	:	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	're	going	to	start	 th 	 is 	 	evolution	with	a	hyena	.
ak	:	the	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	the	horse	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	'll	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	it	.
the	hyena	is	the	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	the	horse	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	part	of	a	production	 call 	 ed 	 	``	faustus	in	africa	,	``	a	handspring	production	from	1995	,	where	it	had	to	play	draughts	with	helen	of	troy	.
 th 	 is 	 	production	was	 direct 	 ed 	 	by	south	african	artist	and	theater	director	,	william	kentridge	.
so	it	 need 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	articulate	front	paw	.
but	,	like	all	 puppet 	 s 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	other	 attribut 	 es 	 	.
bj	:	one	of	them	is	breath	,	and	it	kind	of	 breathe 	 s 	 	.
ak	:	haa	haa	haaa	.
bj	:	breath	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	.
it	's	the	kind	of	original	 move 	 ment 	 	for	any	puppet	for	us	 on 	 stage 	 	.
it	's	the	thing	that	 distinguish 	 es 	 	the	puppet	--	ak	:	 oop 	 s 	 	.
bj	:	from	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
 puppet 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	have	to	try	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	kind	of	ur	-	story	 on 	 stage 	 	,	that	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	to	live	.
ak	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	dead	object	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	and	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	make	it	.
an	 a 	 ctor 	 	 struggle 	 s 	 	to	die	 on 	 stage 	 	,	but	a	puppet	 ha 	 s 	 	to	struggle	to	live	.
and	in	a	way	that	's	a	metaphor	for	life	.
bj	:	so	every	moment	it	's	on	the	stage	,	it	's	making	the	struggle	.
so	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	a	piece	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	that	uses	up	-	to	-	the	-	minute	17th	century	technology	--	to	turn	 no 	 un 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 verb 	 s 	 	.
ak	:	well	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	prefer	to	say	that	it	's	an	object	 construct 	 ed 	 	out	of	wood	and	cloth	with	 move 	 ment 	 	built	 in 	 to 	 	it	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	you	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	life	.
bj	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	so	.
ak	:	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 ear 	 s 	 	that	move	 pass 	 ively 	 	when	the	head	 go 	 es 	 	.
bj	:	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	these	bulkheads	made	out	of	 ply 	 wood 	 	,	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	fabric	--	 cur 	 iously 	 	similar	,	in	fact	,	to	the	 ply 	 wood 	 	 canoe 	 s 	 	that	adrian	's	father	used	to	make	when	he	was	a	boy	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 work 	 shop 	 	.
ak	:	in	port	elizabeth	,	the	village	 out 	 side 	 	port	elizabeth	in	south	africa	.
bj	:	his	mother	was	a	 puppet 	 eer 	 	.
and	when	we	met	at	art	school	and	fell	in	love	in	1971	,	i	 hat 	 ed 	 	 puppet 	 s 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	 be 	 neath 	 	me	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	avant	-	garde	artist	--	and	punch	and	judy	was	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	where	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	.
and	,	in	fact	,	it	took	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	to	discover	the	bambara	bamana	 puppet 	 s 	 	of	mali	in	west	africa	,	where	there	's	a	fabulous	tradition	of	 puppet 	 ry 	 	,	to	learn	a	 renew 	 ed 	 	,	or	a	new	,	respect	for	 th 	 is 	 	art	form	.
ak	:	so	in	1981	,	i	 persuad 	 ed 	 	basil	and	some	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	to	form	a	puppet	company	.
and	20	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 miracul 	 ously 	 	,	we	 collabor 	 ated 	 	with	a	company	from	mali	,	the	sogolon	 mar 	 ion 	 ette 	 	 trou 	 pe 	 	of	bamako	,	where	we	made	a	piece	about	a	tall	giraffe	.
it	was	just	 call 	 ed 	 	``	tall	horse	,	``	which	was	a	life	-	sized	giraffe	.
bj	:	and	here	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	see	the	same	structure	.
the	bulkheads	have	now	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 hoop 	 s 	 	of	 can 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	the	same	structure	.
it	's	got	two	people	 in 	 side 	 	it	on	 s 	 tilt 	 s 	 	,	which	give	them	the	height	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	in	the	front	who	's	using	a	kind	of	 steer 	 ing 	 	wheel	to	move	that	head	.
ak	:	the	person	in	the	hind	 leg 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	tail	,	a	bit	like	the	hyena	--	same	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	just	a	bit	 big 	 ger 	 	.
and	he	's	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	ear	 move 	 ment 	 	.
bj	:	so	 th 	 is 	 	production	was	 s 	 een 	 	by	tom	morris	of	the	national	theatre	in	london	.
and	just	around	that	time	,	his	mother	had	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	have	you	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	book	by	michael	morpurgo	 call 	 ed 	 	'	war	horse	'	?	``
ak	:	it	's	about	a	boy	who	 fall 	 s 	 	in	love	with	a	horse	.
the	horse	is	 s 	 old 	 	to	the	first	world	war	,	and	he	 join 	 s 	 	up	to	find	his	horse	.
bj	:	so	tom	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	call	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	think	you	could	make	us	a	horse	for	a	show	to	happen	at	the	national	theatre	?	``
ak	:	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	a	 love 	 ly 	 	idea	.
bj	:	but	it	had	to	ride	.	it	had	to	have	a	rider	.
ak	:	it	had	to	have	a	rider	,	and	it	had	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	cavalry	 charge 	 s 	 	.
a	play	about	early	20th	century	 plow 	 ing 	 	technology	and	cavalry	 charge 	 s 	 	was	a	little	bit	of	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	the	 account 	 ing 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	at	the	national	theatre	in	london	.
but	they	 agree 	 d 	 	to	go	 a 	 long 	 	with	it	for	a	while	.
so	we	 beg 	 an 	 	with	a	test	.
bj	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	adrian	and	thys	stander	,	who	went	on	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	design	the	 can 	 e 	 	system	for	the	horse	,	and	our	next	-	door	neighbor	katherine	,	 rid 	 ing 	 	on	a	 lad 	 der 	 	.
the	weight	is	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	when	it	's	up	above	your	head	.
ak	:	and	once	we	put	katherine	through	that	 part 	 icular 	 	brand	of	hell	,	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	we	might	be	able	to	make	a	horse	,	which	could	be	ridden	.
so	we	made	a	model	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 card 	 board 	 	model	,	a	little	bit	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	hyena	.
you	'll	notice	that	the	 leg 	 s 	 	are	 ply 	 wood 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	and	the	canoe	structure	is	still	there	.
bj	:	and	the	two	 manipul 	 ators 	 	are	 in 	 side 	 	.
but	we	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	at	the	time	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	a	third	manipulator	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	n't	 manipul 	 ate 	 	the	neck	from	 in 	 side 	 	and	walk	the	horse	at	the	same	time	.
ak	:	we	 start 	 ed 	 	work	on	the	prototype	after	the	model	was	approved	,	and	the	prototype	took	a	bit	 long 	 er 	 	than	we	 anticip 	 ated 	 	.
we	had	to	throw	out	the	 ply 	 wood 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	and	make	new	 can 	 e 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	we	had	a	 crat 	 e 	 	built	for	it	.
it	had	to	be	 ship 	 ped 	 	to	london	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	test	-	drive	it	on	the	street	 out 	 side 	 	of	our	house	in	cape	town	,	and	it	got	to	 mid 	 night 	 	and	we	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	that	yet	.
bj	:	so	we	got	a	camera	,	and	we	posed	the	puppet	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 gall 	 op 	 ing 	 	stances	.
and	we	 s 	 ent 	 	it	off	to	the	national	theatre	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	.
ak	:	a	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	in	london	with	 th 	 is 	 	big	box	and	a	studio	full	of	people	about	to	work	with	us	.
bj	:	about	40	people	.
ak	:	we	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ified 	 	.
we	 open 	 ed 	 	the	 li 	 d 	 	,	we	took	the	horse	out	,	and	it	did	work	;	it	 walk 	 ed 	 	and	it	was	able	to	be	ridden	.
here	i	have	an	18	-	second	clip	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	walk	of	the	prototype	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	national	theatre	studio	,	the	place	where	they	cook	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
it	had	by	no	 mean 	 s 	 	got	the	green	light	yet	.
the	 choreograph 	 er 	 	,	toby	sedgwick	,	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	sequence	where	the	baby	horse	,	which	was	made	out	of	 stick 	 s 	 	and	bits	of	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	,	grew	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	big	horse	.
and	nick	starr	,	the	director	of	the	national	theatre	,	saw	that	 part 	 icular 	 	moment	,	he	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	next	to	me	--	he	 near 	 ly 	 	wet	 him 	 self 	 	.
and	so	the	show	was	 give 	 n 	 	the	green	light	.
and	we	went	back	to	cape	town	and	 re 	 designed 	 	the	horse	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
here	is	the	plan	.
and	here	is	our	 factor 	 y 	 	in	cape	town	where	we	make	 horse 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 skeleton 	 s 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	there	.
the	 horse 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 hand 	 made 	 	.
there	is	 ver 	 y 	 	little	20th	century	technology	in	them	.
we	used	a	bit	of	laser	cutting	on	the	 ply 	 wood 	 	and	some	of	the	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	to	be	light	and	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	and	each	one	of	them	is	different	,	they	ca	n't	be	mass	-	 produce 	 d 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	.
so	here	are	some	half	-	 finish 	 ed 	 	 horse 	 s 	 	ready	to	be	 work 	 ed 	 	in	london	.
and	now	we	would	like	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	joey	.
joey	boy	,	you	there	?
joey	.
joey	.
joey	,	come	here	.
no	,	no	,	i	have	n't	got	it	.
he	's	got	it	;	it	's	in	his	pocket	.
bj	:	joey	.
ak	:	joey	,	joey	,	joey	,	joey	.
come	here	.	stand	here	where	people	can	see	you	.
move	around	.	come	on	.
i	'd	just	like	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	--	i	wo	n't	talk	too	loud	.	he	might	get	 irrit 	 ated 	 	.
here	,	craig	is	 work 	 ing 	 	the	head	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 bi 	 cycle 	 	brake	 cable 	 s 	 	going	down	to	the	head	control	in	his	hand	.
each	one	of	them	 oper 	 ates 	 	either	an	ear	,	 separat 	 e 	 ly 	 	,	or	the	head	,	up	and	down	.
but	he	 al 	 so 	 	 control 	 s 	 	the	head	 direct 	 ly 	 	by	using	his	hand	.
the	 ear 	 s 	 	are	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	the	horse	.
when	they	point	right	back	,	the	horse	is	 fear 	 ful 	 	or	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	 up 	 on 	 	what	's	going	on	in	front	of	him	,	around	him	.
or	,	when	he	's	more	 relax 	 ed 	 	,	the	head	 come 	 s 	 	down	and	the	 ear 	 s 	 	listen	,	either	side	.
 horse 	 s 	 	'	 hear 	 ing 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 sight 	 	.
over	here	,	tommy	's	got	what	you	call	the	heart	position	.
he	's	 work 	 ing 	 	the	leg	.
you	see	the	string	 tend 	 on 	 	from	the	hyena	,	the	hyena	's	front	leg	,	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 pull 	 s 	 	the	hoop	up	.
 horse 	 s 	 	are	so	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
the	way	a	hoof	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	a	horse	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	a	convincing	horse	action	.
the	hind	 leg 	 s 	 	have	got	the	same	action	.
bj	:	and	mikey	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	,	in	his	 finger 	 s 	 	,	the	ability	to	move	the	tail	from	left	to	right	,	and	up	and	down	with	the	other	hand	.
and	together	,	there	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	complex	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	tail	 express 	 ion 	 	.
ak	:	you	want	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	 breath 	 ing 	 	?
bj	:	we	had	a	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	with	 breath 	 ing 	 	.
that	he	was	going	to	have	to	split	the	chest	of	the	puppet	in	two	and	make	it	breathe	like	that	--	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	how	a	horse	would	breathe	,	with	an	 expand 	 ed 	 	chest	.
but	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	if	that	 we 	 re 	 	to	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	you	would	n't	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	audience	,	see	the	breath	.
so	he	made	a	channel	in	here	,	and	the	chest	 move 	 s 	 	up	and	down	in	that	channel	.
so	it	's	anti	-	 natural 	 istic 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	up	and	down	 move 	 ment 	 	,	but	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	breath	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 be 	 cause 	 	all	that	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 puppet 	 eer 	 	 breathe 	 s 	 	with	his	 knee 	 s 	 	.
ak	:	other	 emotion 	 al 	 	stuff	.
if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	touch	the	horse	here	on	his	skin	,	the	heart	 puppet 	 eer 	 	can	shake	the	body	from	 in 	 side 	 	and	get	the	skin	to	quiver	.
you	'll	notice	,	of	course	,	that	the	puppet	is	made	out	of	 can 	 e 	 	lines	.
and	i	would	like	you	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	was	an	aesthetic	choice	,	that	i	was	making	a	three	-	dimensional	 draw 	 ing 	 	of	a	horse	that	 some 	 how 	 	 move 	 s 	 	in	space	.
but	of	course	,	it	was	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	light	,	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	 dur 	 able 	 	and	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	moldable	.
and	so	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	reason	why	it	was	made	of	 can 	 e 	 	.
the	skin	 it 	 self 	 	is	made	out	of	a	see	-	through	nylon	mesh	,	which	,	if	the	 light 	 ing 	 	 design 	 er 	 	 want 	 s 	 	the	horse	to	 al 	 most 	 	disappear	,	she	can	light	the	 back 	 ground 	 	and	the	horse	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	ghostlike	.
you	see	the	skeletal	structure	of	it	.
or	if	you	light	it	from	above	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	solid	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	was	a	practical	 consider 	 ation 	 	.
the	 guy 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	horse	have	to	be	able	to	see	out	.
they	have	to	be	able	to	act	 a 	 long 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	fellow	 act 	 ors 	 	in	the	production	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	an	in	-	the	-	moment	activity	that	they	're	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	.
it	's	three	 head 	 s 	 	making	one	character	.
but	now	we	would	like	you	to	put	joey	through	some	 pace 	 s 	 	.
and	plant	.
thank	you	.
and	now	just	--	all	the	way	from	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	california	we	have	zem	joaquin	who	's	going	to	ride	the	horse	for	us	.
so	we	would	like	to	stress	that	the	performance	you	see	in	the	horse	is	three	 guy 	 s 	 	who	have	 stud 	 ied 	 	horse	behavior	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 thorough 	 ly 	 	.
bj	:	not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	talk	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	while	they	're	 on 	 stage 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	mic	'd	.
the	sound	that	that	 ver 	 y 	 	large	chest	 make 	 s 	 	,	of	the	horse	--	the	whinnying	and	the	nickering	and	 every 	 thing 	 	--	that	 start 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	with	one	 perform 	 er 	 	,	 car 	 ries 	 	on	with	a	second	person	and	 end 	 s 	 	with	a	third	.
