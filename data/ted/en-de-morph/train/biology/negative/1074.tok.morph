we	're	here	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
but	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	from	my	 van 	 t 	 age 	 	point	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	problem	.
 a 	 s 	 	essential	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	 a 	 cross 	 	our	 tradition 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	real	 a 	 s 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	know	it	to	be	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	the	word	``	 compass 	 ion 	 	``	is	 hollow 	 ed 	 	out	in	our	culture	,	and	it	is	suspect	in	my	field	of	 journal 	 ism 	 	.
it	's	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 squish 	 y 	 	kumbaya	thing	,	or	it	's	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 potential 	 ly 	 	 depress 	 ing 	 	.
karen	armstrong	 ha 	 s 	 	told	what	i	think	is	an	 icon 	 ic 	 	story	of	giving	a	speech	in	holland	and	,	after	the	fact	,	the	word	``	 compass 	 ion 	 	``	was	 transl 	 ated 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	 p 	 ity 	 	.	``
now	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	when	it	 enter 	 s 	 	the	news	,	too	often	 come 	 s 	 	in	the	form	of	feel	-	good	feature	 piece 	 s 	 	or	sidebars	about	 hero 	 ic 	 	people	you	could	never	be	like	or	happy	 end 	 ing 	 s 	 	or	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	self	-	sacrifice	that	would	seem	to	be	too	good	to	be	true	most	of	the	time	.
our	cultural	 imagin 	 ation 	 	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	deadened	by	 ideal 	 istic 	 	 image 	 s 	 	.
and	so	what	i	'd	like	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	for	the	next	few	 minute 	 s 	 	is	perform	a	 linguist 	 ic 	 	 resurrect 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	hope	you	'll	come	with	me	on	my	 bas 	 ic 	 	 pre 	 mise 	 	that	 word 	 s 	 	matter	,	that	they	shape	the	way	we	understand	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	the	way	we	interpret	the	world	and	the	way	we	treat	 other 	 s 	 	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	country	first	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	genuine	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	the	1960s	,	we	 adopt 	 ed 	 	 toler 	 ance 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	core	civic	virtue	with	which	we	would	approach	that	.
now	the	word	``	 toler 	 ance 	 	,	``	if	you	look	at	it	in	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	 con 	 note 	 s 	 	``	 allow 	 ing 	 	,	``	``	 indu 	 lg 	 ing 	 	``	and	``	 endur 	 ing 	 	.	``
in	the	medical	 con 	 text 	 	that	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	,	it	is	about	 test 	 ing 	 	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	 thriv 	 ing 	 	in	an	 un 	 favor 	 able 	 	environment	.
 toler 	 ance 	 	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	lived	virtue	;	it	's	more	of	a	cerebral	 a 	 s 	 cent 	 	.
and	it	's	too	cerebral	to	animate	 gut 	 s 	 	and	 heart 	 s 	 	and	behavior	when	the	going	 get 	 s 	 	rough	.
and	the	going	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	rough	right	now	.
i	think	that	 with 	 out 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	name	it	,	we	are	 collect 	 ively 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	that	we	've	come	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	with	 toler 	 ance 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	 on 	 ly 	 	 gui 	 d 	 ing 	 	virtue	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	is	a	worthy	 success 	 or 	 	.
it	is	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	our	religious	,	spiritual	and	 ethic 	 al 	 	 tradition 	 s 	 	,	and	yet	it	 transcend 	 s 	 	them	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	is	a	piece	of	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	that	could	change	us	if	we	 tru 	 ly 	 	let	it	sink	 in 	 to 	 	the	 standard 	 s 	 	to	which	we	hold	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	both	in	our	private	and	in	our	civic	 space 	 s 	 	.
so	what	is	it	,	three	-	dimensionally	?
what	are	 it 	 s 	 	 kind 	 red 	 	and	component	 part 	 s 	 	?
what	's	in	 it 	 s 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	 attend 	 ant 	 	 virtue 	 s 	 	?
to	start	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	i	want	to	say	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	kind	.
now	``	 kind 	 ness 	 	``	might	sound	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	mild	word	,	and	it	's	prone	to	 it 	 s 	 	own	abundant	cliche	.
but	 kind 	 ness 	 	is	an	 every 	 day 	 	 by 	 product 	 	of	all	the	great	 virtue 	 s 	 	.
and	it	is	a	most	edifying	form	of	instant	 grat 	 ification 	 	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	cultivates	and	 practice 	 s 	 	curiosity	.
i	love	a	phrase	that	was	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	me	by	two	young	women	who	are	interfaith	 innov 	 ators 	 	in	los	angeles	,	aziza	hasan	and	malka	fenyvesi	.
they	are	 work 	 ing 	 	to	create	a	new	 imagin 	 ation 	 	about	 share 	 d 	 	life	among	young	jews	and	muslims	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	they	do	that	,	they	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	what	they	call	``	curiosity	 with 	 out 	 	 assumption 	 s 	 	.	``
well	that	's	going	to	be	a	 breed 	 ing 	 	ground	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	can	be	synonymous	with	 empath 	 y 	 	.
it	can	be	 join 	 ed 	 	with	the	 hard 	 er 	 	work	of	 forgive 	 ness 	 	and	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	,	but	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	express	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	simple	act	of	presence	.
it	's	linked	to	practical	 virtue 	 s 	 	like	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	and	 hospital 	 ity 	 	and	just	 be 	 ing 	 	there	,	just	 show 	 ing 	 	up	.
i	think	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 al 	 so 	 	is	often	linked	to	 beaut 	 y 	 	--	and	by	that	i	mean	a	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	see	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	the	other	,	not	just	what	it	is	about	them	that	might	need	 help 	 ing 	 	.
i	love	it	that	my	muslim	conversation	 partner 	 s 	 	often	speak	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	core	moral	value	.
and	in	that	light	,	for	the	religious	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	the	 territ 	 ory 	 	of	 myster 	 y 	 	--	 encourag 	 ing 	 	us	not	just	to	see	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	to	look	for	the	face	of	god	in	the	moment	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	in	the	face	of	a	 strange 	 r 	 	,	in	the	face	of	the	 vib 	 rant 	 	religious	other	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	if	i	can	show	you	what	 toler 	 ance 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	but	i	can	show	you	what	 compass 	 ion 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	visible	.
when	we	see	it	,	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	it	and	it	 change 	 s 	 	the	way	we	think	about	what	is	 do 	 able 	 	,	what	is	possible	.
it	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	when	we	're	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	big	 idea 	 s 	 	--	but	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	a	big	spiritual	idea	like	 compass 	 ion 	 	--	to	root	it	 a 	 s 	 	we	present	it	to	 other 	 s 	 	in	space	and	time	and	 fl 	 esh 	 	and	blood	--	the	color	and	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	life	.
and	 compass 	 ion 	 	 do 	 es 	 	seek	 physical 	 ity 	 	.
i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	to	learn	 th 	 is 	 	most	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	from	matthew	sanford	.
and	i	do	n't	imagine	that	you	will	 real 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	when	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	of	him	,	but	he	's	paraplegic	.
he	's	 be 	 en 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	from	the	waist	down	since	he	was	13	,	in	a	car	crash	that	 kill 	 ed 	 	his	father	and	his	sister	.
matthew	's	 leg 	 s 	 	do	n't	work	,	and	he	'll	never	walk	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	--	and	he	 do 	 es 	 	experience	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	``	and	``	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	``	but	``	--	and	he	 experience 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	be	 heal 	 ed 	 	and	whole	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	teacher	of	 y 	 oga 	 	,	he	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	experience	to	 other 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	spectrum	of	ability	and	 dis 	 ability 	 	,	health	,	 ill 	 ness 	 	and	aging	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	that	he	's	just	at	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	end	of	the	spectrum	we	're	all	on	.
he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	work	now	with	 veteran 	 s 	 	coming	back	from	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	afghanistan	.
and	matthew	 ha 	 s 	 	made	 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	that	i	'm	just	going	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	and	let	it	 s 	 it 	 	.
i	ca	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	explain	it	,	and	he	ca	n't	either	.
but	he	 say 	 s 	 	that	he	 ha 	 s 	 	yet	to	experience	 some 	 one 	 	who	 be 	 came 	 	more	aware	of	 the 	 ir 	 	body	,	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	 f 	 rail 	 ty 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	grace	,	 with 	 out 	 	,	at	the	same	time	,	 be 	 coming 	 	more	 com 	 passionate 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	all	of	life	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	jean	vanier	.
jean	vanier	 help 	 ed 	 	found	the	l'arche	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	which	you	can	now	find	all	over	the	world	,	 commun 	 ities 	 	 center 	 ed 	 	around	life	with	people	with	mental	 dis 	 abilities 	 	--	 most 	 ly 	 	down	syndrome	.
the	 commun 	 ities 	 	that	jean	vanier	 found 	 ed 	 	,	like	jean	vanier	 him 	 self 	 	,	exude	 tender 	 ness 	 	.
``	tender	``	is	 an 	 other 	 	word	i	would	love	to	 s 	 pend 	 	some	time	resurrecting	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	so	much	time	in	 th 	 is 	 	culture	 be 	 ing 	 	driven	and	 aggress 	 ive 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 be 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	too	.
and	 compass 	 ion 	 	can	 al 	 so 	 	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	lived	 compass 	 ion 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	back	to	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	 tender 	 ness 	 	.
jean	vanier	 say 	 s 	 	that	his	work	,	like	the	work	of	other	people	--	his	great	,	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	,	late	friend	mother	teresa	--	is	never	in	the	first	 in 	 stance 	 	about	changing	the	world	;	it	's	in	the	first	 in 	 stance 	 	about	changing	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
he	's	 say 	 s 	 	that	what	they	do	with	l'arche	is	not	a	solution	,	but	a	sign	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 rare 	 ly 	 	a	solution	,	but	it	is	 al 	 ways 	 	a	sign	of	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	,	of	 deep 	 er 	 	human	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
and	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 unleash 	 ed 	 	in	 wide 	 r 	 	and	 wide 	 r 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	by	 sign 	 s 	 	and	 st 	 ories 	 	,	never	by	 statistic 	 s 	 	and	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.
we	need	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	too	,	but	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 bump 	 ing 	 	up	against	 the 	 ir 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	.
and	at	the	same	time	that	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	i	think	we	are	 re 	 discover 	 ing 	 	the	power	of	story	--	that	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	we	need	 st 	 ories 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	to	flourish	,	to	change	.
our	 tradition 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	known	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	that	is	why	they	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 cultiv 	 ated 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	and	carried	them	forward	in	time	for	us	.
there	is	,	of	course	,	a	story	 be 	 hind 	 	the	key	moral	 long 	 ing 	 	and	 command 	 ment 	 	of	judaism	to	repair	the	world	--	tikkun	olam	.
and	i	'll	never	forget	 hear 	 ing 	 	that	story	from	dr.	rachel	naomi	remen	,	who	told	it	to	me	 a 	 s 	 	her	 grand 	 father 	 	told	it	to	her	,	that	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	creation	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	and	the	original	light	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	 shatter 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 count 	 less 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
it	 lodg 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 hard 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	creation	.
and	that	the	highest	human	 call 	 ing 	 	is	to	look	for	 th 	 is 	 	light	,	to	point	at	it	when	we	see	it	,	to	gather	it	up	,	and	in	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	to	repair	the	world	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	might	sound	like	a	 fanci 	 ful 	 	tale	.
some	of	my	fellow	 journalist 	 s 	 	might	interpret	it	that	way	.
rachel	naomi	remen	 say 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	and	 empower 	 ing 	 	story	for	our	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	 insist 	 s 	 	that	each	and	every	one	of	us	,	 f 	 rail 	 	and	 flaw 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	may	be	,	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	may	feel	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	 need 	 ed 	 	to	help	repair	the	part	of	the	world	that	we	can	see	and	touch	.
 st 	 ories 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 sign 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	are	practical	 tool 	 s 	 	in	a	world	 long 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	to	abundant	 image 	 s 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	that	can	 other 	 wise 	 	overwhelm	us	.
rachel	naomi	remen	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	back	to	 it 	 s 	 	 right 	 ful 	 	place	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	science	in	her	field	of	medicine	in	the	training	of	new	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	trend	of	what	rachel	naomi	remen	is	 do 	 ing 	 	,	how	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 virtue 	 s 	 	are	 find 	 ing 	 	a	place	in	the	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	of	medicine	--	the	work	fred	luskin	is	 do 	 ing 	 	--	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 develop 	 ments 	 	of	the	21st	century	--	that	science	,	in	fact	,	is	taking	a	virtue	like	 compass 	 ion 	 	 definitive 	 ly 	 	out	of	the	realm	of	 ideal 	 ism 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	change	science	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	and	it	will	change	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
but	here	's	a	face	from	20th	century	science	that	might	surprise	you	in	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
we	all	know	about	the	albert	einstein	who	came	up	with	e	=	mc2	.
we	do	n't	hear	so	much	about	the	einstein	who	 invit 	 ed 	 	the	african	american	opera	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	,	marian	anderson	,	to	stay	in	his	home	when	she	came	to	 s 	 ing 	 	in	princeton	 be 	 cause 	 	the	best	hotel	there	was	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	and	would	n't	have	her	.
we	do	n't	hear	about	the	einstein	who	used	his	 celebr 	 ity 	 	to	 advoc 	 ate 	 	for	 politic 	 al 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	in	europe	or	the	scottsboro	 boy 	 s 	 	in	the	american	south	.
einstein	 believ 	 ed 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	that	science	should	transcend	national	and	ethnic	 division 	 s 	 	.
but	he	 watch 	 ed 	 	 physicist 	 s 	 	and	 chemist 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	the	 pur 	 vey 	 ors 	 	of	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	in	the	early	20th	century	.
he	once	 s 	 aid 	 	that	science	in	his	generation	had	 be 	 come 	 	like	a	razor	blade	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	a	three	-	year	-	old	.
and	einstein	 fore 	 saw 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	we	grow	more	modern	and	 techno 	 logically 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	,	we	need	the	 virtue 	 s 	 	our	 tradition 	 s 	 	carry	forward	in	time	more	,	not	less	.
he	 like 	 d 	 	to	talk	about	the	spiritual	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	of	the	 age 	 s 	 	.
some	of	his	 favor 	 ites 	 	 we 	 re 	 	moses	,	jesus	,	buddha	,	st.	francis	of	assisi	,	gandhi	--	he	 ador 	 ed 	 	his	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	,	gandhi	.
and	einstein	 s 	 aid 	 	--	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	quote	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	down	in	his	 leg 	 acy 	 	--	that	``	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	in	the	art	of	living	,	more	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	the	dignity	,	security	and	joy	of	 human 	 ity 	 	than	the	discoverers	of	 object 	 ive 	 	knowledge	.	``
now	 in 	 vo 	 king 	 	einstein	might	not	seem	the	best	way	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	down	to	earth	and	make	it	seem	 access 	 ible 	 	to	all	the	rest	of	us	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	is	.
i	want	to	show	you	the	rest	of	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	is	 analog 	 ous 	 	to	what	we	do	to	the	word	``	 compass 	 ion 	 	``	in	our	culture	--	we	clean	it	up	and	we	diminish	 it 	 s 	 	 depth 	 s 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 ground 	 ing 	 	in	life	,	which	is	 mess 	 y 	 	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	you	see	a	mind	looking	out	a	window	at	what	might	be	a	 cat 	 hedral 	 	--	it	's	not	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	full	photograph	,	and	you	see	a	middle	-	aged	man	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	leather	jacket	,	 smok 	 ing 	 	a	cigar	.
and	by	the	look	of	that	paunch	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	 y 	 oga 	 	.
we	put	these	two	 photograph 	 s 	 	side	-	by	-	side	on	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	 some 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	when	i	look	at	the	first	photo	,	i	ask	 my 	 self 	 	,	what	was	he	 think 	 ing 	 	?
and	when	i	look	at	the	second	,	i	ask	,	what	kind	of	person	was	he	?	what	kind	of	man	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
well	,	he	was	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
he	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 com 	 passionate 	 	in	some	of	his	 relationship 	 s 	 	and	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	in	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	it	is	much	 hard 	 er 	 	,	often	,	to	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 close 	 st 	 	to	us	,	which	is	 an 	 other 	 	quality	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	on	 it 	 s 	 	dark	side	,	that	 al 	 so 	 	 deserve 	 s 	 	our	serious	attention	and	 illumi 	 nation 	 	.
gandhi	,	too	,	was	a	real	 flaw 	 ed 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
so	was	martin	luther	king	,	jr.	so	was	dorothy	day	.
so	was	mother	teresa	.
so	are	we	all	.
and	i	want	to	say	that	it	is	a	 liber 	 ating 	 	thing	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	that	is	no	obstacle	to	 compass 	 ion 	 	--	 follow 	 ing 	 	on	what	fred	luskin	 say 	 s 	 	--	that	these	 flaw 	 s 	 	just	make	us	human	.
our	culture	is	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 perfect 	 ion 	 	and	with	 hid 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	what	a	 liber 	 ating 	 	thing	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	our	 problem 	 s 	 	,	in	fact	,	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	our	 rich 	 est 	 	 source 	 s 	 	for	 ris 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	ultimate	virtue	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	 joy 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
rachel	naomi	remen	is	a	better	doctor	 be 	 cause 	 	of	her	life	-	long	struggle	with	crohn	's	disease	.
einstein	 be 	 came 	 	a	 human 	 itarian 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	his	exquisite	knowledge	of	space	and	time	and	matter	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	a	jew	 a 	 s 	 	germany	grew	 fasci 	 st 	 	.
and	karen	armstrong	,	i	think	you	would	 al 	 so 	 	say	that	it	was	some	of	your	 ver 	 y 	 	wounding	 experience 	 s 	 	in	a	religious	life	that	,	with	a	zigzag	,	have	led	to	the	 chart 	 er 	 	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	ca	n't	be	 reduc 	 ed 	 	to	sainthood	any	more	than	it	can	be	 reduc 	 ed 	 	to	 p 	 ity 	 	.
so	i	want	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	a	final	definition	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	einstein	with	paul	robeson	by	the	way	--	and	that	would	be	for	us	to	call	 compass 	 ion 	 	a	spiritual	technology	.
now	our	 tradition 	 s 	 	contain	vast	 wis 	 dom 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	need	them	to	mine	it	for	us	now	.
but	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	at	home	in	the	secular	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	religious	.
so	i	will	 para 	 phrase 	 	einstein	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	and	say	that	 human 	 ity 	 	,	the	future	of	 human 	 ity 	 	,	 need 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	it	 need 	 s 	 	all	the	 other 	 s 	 	that	have	now	 connect 	 ed 	 	us	and	set	before	us	the	 terrify 	 ing 	 	and	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	one	human	race	.
thank	you	.
