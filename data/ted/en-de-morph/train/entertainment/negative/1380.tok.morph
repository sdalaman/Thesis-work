what	do	i	know	that	would	cause	me	,	a	 re 	 tic 	 ent 	 	,	midwestern	scientist	,	to	get	 my 	 self 	 	 arrest 	 ed 	 	in	front	of	the	white	house	 protest 	 ing 	 	?
and	what	would	you	do	if	you	 k 	 new 	 	what	i	know	?
let	's	start	with	how	i	got	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
i	was	 luck 	 y 	 	to	grow	up	at	a	time	when	it	was	not	difficult	for	the	child	of	a	 ten 	 ant 	 	 farm 	 er 	 	to	make	his	way	to	the	state	university	.
and	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	go	to	the	university	of	iowa	where	i	could	 stud 	 y 	 	under	professor	james	van	allen	who	built	 instrument 	 s 	 	for	the	first	u.s.	 satellite 	 s 	 	.
professor	van	allen	told	me	about	 observ 	 ations 	 	of	venus	,	that	there	was	 intens 	 e 	 	 micro 	 wave 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
did	it	mean	that	venus	had	an	 ion 	 o 	 sphere 	 	?
or	was	venus	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	hot	?
the	right	answer	,	 confirm 	 ed 	 	by	the	soviet	venera	 space 	 craft 	 	,	was	that	venus	was	 ver 	 y 	 	hot	--	900	 degree 	 s 	 	fahrenheit	.
and	it	was	 ke 	 pt 	 	hot	by	a	thick	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	atmosphere	.
i	was	fortunate	to	join	nasa	and	 success 	 fully 	 	 pro 	 pose 	 	an	experiment	to	fly	to	venus	.
our	instrument	took	 th 	 is 	 	image	of	the	veil	of	venus	,	which	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	smog	of	 sulfur 	 ic 	 	acid	.
but	while	our	instrument	was	 be 	 ing 	 	built	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 calcul 	 ations 	 	of	the	 green 	 house 	 	effect	here	on	earth	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	our	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	 com 	 position 	 	was	changing	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	i	 re 	 sign 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	principal	 invest 	 igator 	 	on	our	venus	experiment	 be 	 cause 	 	a	planet	changing	before	our	 eye 	 s 	 	is	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 it 	 s 	 	 change 	 s 	 	will	affect	all	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
the	 green 	 house 	 	effect	had	 be 	 en 	 	well	 under 	 stood 	 	for	more	than	a	century	.
british	physicist	john	tyndall	,	in	the	1850	's	,	made	 labor 	 atory 	 	 measure 	 ments 	 	of	the	 infra 	 red 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	heat	.
and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	that	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	co	2	absorb	heat	,	thus	 act 	 ing 	 	like	a	 blank 	 et 	 	 warm 	 ing 	 	earth	's	surface	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	other	 scientist 	 s 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	earth	climate	 observ 	 ations 	 	.
in	1981	,	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	an	article	in	science	magazine	 con 	 clud 	 ing 	 	that	 observ 	 ed 	 	 warm 	 ing 	 	of	0.4	 degree 	 s 	 	celsius	in	the	prior	century	was	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	the	 green 	 house 	 	effect	of	increasing	co	2	.
that	earth	would	 like 	 ly 	 	warm	in	the	1980	's	,	and	 warm 	 ing 	 	would	exceed	the	noise	level	of	random	weather	by	the	end	of	the	century	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	21st	century	would	see	shifting	climate	 zone 	 s 	 	,	creation	of	drought	-	prone	 region 	 s 	 	in	north	america	and	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	of	ice	 sheet 	 s 	 	,	 ris 	 ing 	 	sea	 level 	 s 	 	and	 open 	 ing 	 	of	the	 fab 	 led 	 	 north 	 west 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	.
all	of	these	 impact 	 s 	 	have	since	either	 happen 	 ed 	 	or	are	now	well	under	way	.
that	paper	was	 report 	 ed 	 	on	the	front	page	of	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	and	led	to	me	 test 	 ifying 	 	to	congress	in	the	1980	's	,	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	in	which	i	 emphas 	 ized 	 	that	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	both	 extrem 	 es 	 	of	the	earth	's	water	cycle	.
 heat 	 wave 	 s 	 	and	 drought 	 s 	 	on	one	hand	,	 direct 	 ly 	 	from	the	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	 warm 	 er 	 	atmosphere	 hold 	 s 	 	more	water	vapor	with	 it 	 s 	 	 lat 	 ent 	 	energy	,	 rain 	 fall 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	in	more	 extrem 	 e 	 	 event 	 s 	 	.
there	will	be	 strong 	 er 	 	 storm 	 s 	 	and	 great 	 er 	 	 flood 	 ing 	 	.
global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 hoo 	 pla 	 	 be 	 came 	 	time	-	 consum 	 ing 	 	and	 distract 	 ed 	 	me	from	 do 	 ing 	 	science	--	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	 complain 	 ed 	 	that	the	white	house	 alter 	 ed 	 	my	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	back	to	 strict 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	science	and	 leav 	 e 	 	the	communication	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
by	15	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	evidence	of	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	was	much	 strong 	 er 	 	.
most	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	in	our	1981	paper	 we 	 re 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	.
i	had	the	privilege	to	speak	twice	to	the	 p 	 resident 	 	's	climate	task	force	.
but	energy	 poli 	 cies 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	focus	on	 find 	 ing 	 	more	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
by	then	we	had	two	 grand 	 children 	 	,	sophie	and	connor	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	did	not	want	them	in	the	future	to	say	,	``	opa	 under 	 stood 	 	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	but	he	did	n't	make	it	clear	.	``
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	a	public	talk	 critic 	 izing 	 	the	lack	of	an	appropriate	energy	policy	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	the	talk	at	the	university	of	iowa	in	2004	and	at	the	2005	 meet 	 ing 	 	of	the	american	geophysical	 un 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	led	to	 call 	 s 	 	from	the	white	house	to	nasa	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	and	i	was	told	that	i	could	not	give	any	 talk 	 s 	 	or	speak	with	the	media	 with 	 out 	 	prior	 ex 	 plicit 	 	approval	by	nasa	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
after	i	 inform 	 ed 	 	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	about	these	 restrict 	 ions 	 	,	nasa	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	end	the	 censor 	 ship 	 	.
but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
i	had	 be 	 en 	 	using	the	first	line	of	the	nasa	mission	 state 	 ment 	 	,	``	to	understand	and	protect	the	home	planet	,	``	to	 just 	 ify 	 	my	 talk 	 s 	 	.
soon	the	first	line	of	the	mission	 state 	 ment 	 	was	 delet 	 ed 	 	,	never	to	appear	 aga 	 in 	 	.
over	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	i	was	drawn	more	and	more	 in 	 to 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	communicate	the	 urge 	 ncy 	 	of	a	change	in	energy	 poli 	 cies 	 	,	while	still	 research 	 ing 	 	the	physics	of	climate	change	.
let	me	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	from	the	physics	--	first	,	from	earth	's	energy	balance	and	,	second	,	from	earth	's	climate	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
 add 	 ing 	 	co	2	to	the	air	is	like	 throw 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 blank 	 et 	 	on	the	bed	.
it	 reduc 	 es 	 	earth	's	heat	 radi 	 ation 	 	to	space	,	so	there	's	a	 tempor 	 ary 	 	energy	 im 	 balance 	 	.
more	energy	is	coming	in	than	going	out	,	 un 	 til 	 	earth	 warm 	 s 	 	up	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 aga 	 in 	 	radiate	to	space	 a 	 s 	 	much	energy	 a 	 s 	 	it	 absorb 	 s 	 	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
so	the	key	 quant 	 ity 	 	is	earth	's	energy	 im 	 balance 	 	.
is	there	more	energy	coming	in	than	going	out	?
if	so	,	more	 warm 	 ing 	 	is	in	the	 pipe 	 line 	 	.
it	will	occur	 with 	 out 	 	 add 	 ing 	 	any	more	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	.
now	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	can	measure	earth	's	energy	 im 	 balance 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	by	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	heat	content	in	earth	's	heat	 reservoir 	 s 	 	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	reservoir	,	the	ocean	,	was	the	 l 	 east 	 	well	 measur 	 ed 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	more	than	3,000	argo	 float 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	's	ocean	.
these	 float 	 s 	 	reveal	that	the	upper	half	of	the	ocean	is	 gain 	 ing 	 	heat	at	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 	rate	.
the	deep	ocean	is	 al 	 so 	 	 gain 	 ing 	 	heat	at	a	 small 	 er 	 	rate	,	and	energy	is	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	net	 melt 	 ing 	 	of	ice	all	around	the	planet	.
and	the	land	,	to	 depth 	 s 	 	of	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 meter 	 s 	 	,	is	 al 	 so 	 	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
the	total	energy	 im 	 balance 	 	now	is	about	six	-	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	a	watt	per	square	meter	.
that	may	not	sound	like	much	,	but	when	 add 	 ed 	 	up	over	the	whole	world	,	it	's	enormous	.
it	's	about	20	 time 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	than	the	rate	of	energy	use	by	all	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
it	's	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	 expl 	 o 	 d 	 ing 	 	400,000	hiroshima	atomic	 bomb 	 s 	 	per	day	365	 day 	 s 	 	per	year	.
that	's	how	much	extra	energy	earth	is	 gain 	 ing 	 	each	day	.
 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 balance 	 	,	if	we	want	to	 stabil 	 ize 	 	climate	,	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	must	 reduc 	 e 	 	co	2	from	391	ppm	,	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	,	back	to	350	ppm	.
that	is	the	change	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 store 	 	energy	balance	and	prevent	further	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
climate	change	 deni 	 ers 	 	 argu 	 e 	 	that	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	the	main	cause	of	climate	change	.
but	the	 measur 	 ed 	 	energy	 im 	 balance 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 deep 	 est 	 	solar	 minim 	 um 	 	in	the	record	,	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	energy	 reach 	 ing 	 	earth	was	 l 	 east 	 	.
yet	,	there	was	more	energy	coming	in	than	going	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	the	effect	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	 vari 	 ations 	 	on	climate	is	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	the	increasing	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	,	 main 	 ly 	 	from	 burn 	 ing 	 	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
now	consider	earth	's	climate	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
these	 curv 	 es 	 	for	global	temperature	,	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	co	2	and	sea	level	 we 	 re 	 	derived	from	ocean	 core 	 s 	 	and	antarctic	ice	 core 	 s 	 	,	from	ocean	 sediment 	 s 	 	and	 snow 	 flake 	 s 	 	that	 pil 	 ed 	 	up	year	after	year	over	800,000	 year 	 s 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	a	two	-	mile	thick	ice	sheet	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	see	,	there	's	a	high	correlation	between	temperature	,	co	2	and	sea	level	.
 care 	 ful 	 	examination	 show 	 s 	 	that	the	temperature	 change 	 s 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	lead	the	co	2	 change 	 s 	 	by	a	few	centuries	.
climate	change	 deni 	 ers 	 	like	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	fact	to	 con 	 fuse 	 	and	trick	the	public	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	look	,	the	temperature	 cause 	 s 	 	co	2	to	change	,	not	vice	versa	.	``
but	that	lag	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	is	 expect 	 ed 	 	.

the	 import 	 ant 	 	point	is	that	these	same	 ampl 	 ifying 	 	 feed 	 back 	 s 	 	will	occur	 to 	 day 	 	.

while	we	ca	n't	say	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	fast	these	 ampl 	 ifying 	 	 feed 	 back 	 s 	 	will	occur	,	it	is	certain	they	will	occur	,	 un 	 less 	 	we	stop	the	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
there	is	evidence	that	 feed 	 back 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	.

but	 in 	 stead 	 	of	placing	a	 ris 	 ing 	 	fee	on	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	to	make	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	pay	 the 	 ir 	 	true	cost	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	our	 government 	 s 	 	are	forcing	the	public	to	subsidize	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	by	400	to	500	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	year	 world 	 wide 	 	,	thus	 encourag 	 ing 	 	 extra 	 ction 	 	of	every	fossil	fuel	--	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	,	 long 	 wall 	 	 min 	 ing 	 	,	 f 	 rack 	 ing 	 	,	tar	 sand 	 s 	 	,	tar	 sha 	 le 	 	,	deep	ocean	 arc 	 tic 	 	 drill 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	path	,	if	 continu 	 ed 	 	,	 guarantee 	 s 	 	that	we	will	pass	 tip 	 ping 	 	 point 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	ice	sheet	 dis 	 integ 	 ration 	 	that	will	 accele 	 rate 	 	out	of	control	of	future	 generation 	 s 	 	.

and	increasing	 intens 	 ity 	 	of	 drought 	 s 	 	and	 flood 	 s 	 	will	 severe 	 ly 	 	impact	 bread 	 basket 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	 caus 	 ing 	 	massive	 famine 	 s 	 	and	economic	decline	.
imagine	a	giant	 a 	 steroid 	 	on	a	direct	collision	course	with	earth	.
that	is	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	what	we	face	now	.
yet	,	we	 di 	 ther 	 	,	taking	no	action	to	divert	the	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 long 	 er 	 	we	wait	,	the	more	difficult	and	expensive	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	.
if	we	had	 start 	 ed 	 	in	2005	,	it	would	have	 requir 	 ed 	 	 e 	 mission 	 	 reduc 	 tions 	 	of	three	percent	per	year	to	 re 	 store 	 	planetary	energy	balance	and	 stabil 	 ize 	 	climate	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
if	we	start	next	year	,	it	is	six	percent	per	year	.
if	we	wait	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	is	15	percent	per	year	--	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	difficult	and	expensive	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
but	we	are	n't	even	 start 	 ing 	 	.
so	now	you	know	what	i	know	that	is	moving	me	to	sound	 th 	 is 	 	alarm	.
 clear 	 ly 	 	,	i	have	n't	gotten	 th 	 is 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
the	science	is	clear	.
i	need	your	help	to	communicate	the	 gravit 	 y 	 	and	the	 urge 	 ncy 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	more	 effective 	 ly 	 	.
we	owe	it	to	our	children	and	 grand 	 children 	 	.
thank	you	.
