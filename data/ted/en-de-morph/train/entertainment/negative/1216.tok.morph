i	want	to	address	the	issue	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
some	of	them	are	fierce	;	some	of	them	are	 wrath 	 ful 	 	;	some	of	them	are	tender	;	some	of	them	are	wise	.
a	line	that	the	dalai	lama	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	love	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	are	 necess 	 ities 	 	.
they	are	not	 luxur 	 ies 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	them	,	 human 	 ity 	 	can	not	 surviv 	 e 	 	.	``
and	i	would	suggest	,	it	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	that	wo	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	but	it	is	all	species	on	the	planet	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	is	the	big	 cat 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	the	plankton	.
two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	in	bangalore	in	india	.
i	was	so	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	be	able	to	teach	in	a	 ho 	 spice 	 	on	the	 out 	 skirt 	 s 	 	of	bangalore	.
and	early	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	ward	.
in	that	 ho 	 spice 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	31	men	and	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	 active 	 ly 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	 bed 	 side 	 	of	an	old	woman	who	was	 breath 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	fragile	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	in	the	 lat 	 ter 	 	phase	of	active	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	her	face	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	face	of	her	son	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	her	,	and	his	face	was	just	riven	with	grief	and	 con 	 fusion 	 	.
and	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	a	line	from	the	mahabharata	,	the	great	indian	epic	:	``	what	is	the	most	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	thing	in	the	world	,	yudhisthira	?	``
and	yudhisthira	 re 	 plied 	 	,	``	the	most	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	thing	in	the	world	is	that	all	around	us	people	can	be	 dy 	 ing 	 	and	we	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	it	can	happen	to	us	.	``
i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	.
 tend 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	31	 dy 	 ing 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	young	women	from	 village 	 s 	 	around	bangalore	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	face	of	one	of	these	women	,	and	i	saw	in	her	face	the	strength	that	 arise 	 s 	 	when	natural	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	present	.
i	 watch 	 ed 	 	her	 hand 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	she	 bath 	 ed 	 	an	old	man	.
my	 gaz 	 e 	 	went	to	 an 	 other 	 	young	woman	 a 	 s 	 	she	 wipe 	 d 	 	the	face	of	 an 	 other 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	person	.
and	it	 re 	 minded 	 	me	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	present	for	.
every	year	or	so	,	i	have	the	privilege	of	taking	 clinic 	 ians 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	himalayas	and	the	tibetan	 plate 	 au 	 	.
and	we	run	 clinic 	 s 	 	in	these	 ver 	 y 	 	remote	 region 	 s 	 	where	there	's	no	medical	care	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
and	on	the	first	day	at	simikot	in	humla	,	far	west	of	nepal	,	the	most	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	region	of	nepal	,	an	old	man	came	in	 clutch 	 ing 	 	a	 bundl 	 e 	 	of	 rag 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	him	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	he	was	deaf	,	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 rag 	 s 	 	,	and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	pair	of	 eye 	 s 	 	.
the	 rag 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 wrap 	 ped 	 	from	a	little	girl	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	body	was	 massive 	 ly 	 	 burn 	 ed 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 eye 	 s 	 	and	 hand 	 s 	 	of	avalokiteshvara	.
it	was	the	young	women	,	the	health	 aid 	 s 	 	,	who	 clean 	 ed 	 	the	 wound 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	baby	and	 dress 	 ed 	 	the	 wound 	 s 	 	.
i	know	 t 	 hose 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	and	 eye 	 s 	 	;	they	 touch 	 ed 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
they	 touch 	 ed 	 	me	at	that	time	.
they	have	 touch 	 ed 	 	me	 through 	 out 	 	my	68	 year 	 s 	 	.
they	 touch 	 ed 	 	me	when	i	was	four	and	i	lost	my	 eye 	 sight 	 	and	was	 partial 	 ly 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
and	my	family	 br 	 ought 	 	in	a	woman	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	mother	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	slave	to	take	care	of	me	.
and	that	woman	did	not	have	 sentiment 	 al 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
she	had	 phenomen 	 al 	 	strength	.
and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	her	strength	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	that	 be 	 came 	 	the	kind	of	mudra	and	 im 	 pri 	 matur 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 gui 	 d 	 ing 	 	light	in	my	life	.
so	we	can	ask	:	what	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	of	?
and	there	are	 vari 	 ous 	 	 facet 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	 refer 	 ential 	 	and	non	-	 refer 	 ential 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
but	first	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	of	that	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	see	 clear 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	nature	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
it	is	that	ability	to	 re 	 ally 	 	stand	strong	and	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 al 	 so 	 	that	i	'm	not	 separat 	 e 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
but	that	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	which	 activate 	 s 	 	the	motor	cortex	,	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	 aspir 	 e 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 aspir 	 e 	 	to	transform	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	we	're	so	 bless 	 ed 	 	,	we	engage	in	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	transform	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
but	 compass 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	component	,	and	that	component	is	 re 	 ally 	 	essential	.
that	component	is	that	we	can	not	be	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	 out 	 come 	 	.
now	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	 dy 	 ing 	 	people	for	over	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	had	the	privilege	of	 work 	 ing 	 	on	death	row	in	a	 maxim 	 um 	 	security	[	 pri 	 son 	 	]	for	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	so	 clear 	 ly 	 	in	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	my	own	life	experience	,	from	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 dy 	 ing 	 	people	and	training	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	,	that	any	 attach 	 ment 	 	to	 out 	 come 	 	would	distort	 deep 	 ly 	 	my	own	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	be	fully	present	to	the	whole	 catastroph 	 e 	 	.
and	when	i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	 pri 	 son 	 	system	,	it	was	so	clear	to	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	and	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	the	men	that	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	on	death	row	,	the	 seed 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 compass 	 ion 	 	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	 water 	 ed 	 	.
that	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	inherent	human	quality	.
it	is	there	 with 	 in 	 	every	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
but	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	to	be	 activate 	 d 	 	,	to	be	 arouse 	 d 	 	,	are	 part 	 icular 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	.
i	had	that	condition	,	to	a	certain	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	from	my	own	 child 	 hood 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
eve	ensler	,	whom	you	'll	hear	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	had	that	condition	 activate 	 d 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	in	her	through	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 water 	 s 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	that	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	through	.
and	what	is	 fasci 	 nating 	 	is	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ene 	 mies 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 ene 	 mies 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 p 	 ity 	 	,	moral	 out 	 rage 	 	,	fear	.
and	you	know	,	we	have	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	a	world	,	that	is	 paralyze 	 d 	 	by	fear	.
and	in	that	 para 	 lysis 	 	,	of	course	,	our	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	word	terror	is	global	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	terror	is	global	.
so	our	work	,	in	a	certain	way	,	is	to	address	 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 ago 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 arche 	 type 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 pervad 	 ed 	 	the	 psych 	 e 	 	of	our	entire	 glob 	 e 	 	.
now	we	know	from	 neuro 	 science 	 	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	a	person	who	is	 cultiv 	 ating 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	when	they	are	in	the	presence	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	they	feel	that	 suffer 	 ing 	 	a	lot	more	than	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	do	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	they	return	to	 base 	 line 	 	a	lot	 soon 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 resili 	 ence 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	us	think	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 drain 	 s 	 	us	,	but	i	promise	you	it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 tru 	 ly 	 	 enliven 	 s 	 	us	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 enhance 	 s 	 	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	neural	 integ 	 ration 	 	.
it	 hook 	 s 	 	up	all	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	.
 an 	 other 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	 vari 	 ous 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	at	emory	and	at	davis	and	so	on	,	is	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 enhance 	 s 	 	our	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
 he 	 y 	 	,	we	live	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 nox 	 ious 	 	world	.
most	of	us	are	 shrink 	 ing 	 	in	the	face	of	psycho	-	social	and	physical	 poison 	 s 	 	,	of	the	 toxin 	 s 	 	of	our	world	.
but	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	the	generation	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mobilize 	 s 	 	our	 immun 	 ity 	 	.
you	know	,	if	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	so	good	for	us	,	i	have	a	question	.
why	do	n't	we	train	our	children	in	 compass 	 ion 	 	?
if	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	so	good	for	us	,	why	do	n't	we	train	our	health	care	 provide 	 rs 	 	in	 compass 	 ion 	 	so	that	they	can	do	what	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	,	which	is	to	 re 	 ally 	 	transform	 suffer 	 ing 	 	?
and	if	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	so	good	for	us	,	why	do	n't	we	vote	on	 compass 	 ion 	 	?
why	do	n't	we	vote	for	people	in	our	government	based	on	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	so	that	we	can	have	a	more	 car 	 ing 	 	world	?
in	buddhism	,	we	say	,	``	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	strong	back	and	a	soft	front	.	``
it	 take 	 s 	 	tremendous	strength	of	the	back	to	 up 	 hold 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	 condition 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	the	mental	quality	of	 equ 	 anim 	 ity 	 	.
but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 take 	 s 	 	a	soft	front	--	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	be	open	to	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	to	have	an	 un 	 defend 	 ed 	 	heart	.
and	the	 arche 	 type 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	buddhism	is	avalokiteshvara	,	kuan	-	 y 	 in 	 	.
it	's	a	female	 arche 	 type 	 	:	she	who	 perceive 	 s 	 	the	 cri 	 es 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	.
she	 stand 	 s 	 	with	10,000	 arm 	 s 	 	,	and	in	every	hand	,	there	is	an	instrument	of	 liber 	 ation 	 	,	and	in	the	palm	of	every	hand	,	there	are	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	these	are	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
i	say	that	,	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	women	have	lived	,	 exempl 	 ified 	 	,	met	in	 in 	 timacy 	 	,	the	 arche 	 type 	 	of	avalokitesvara	,	of	kuan	-	 y 	 in 	 	,	she	who	 perceive 	 s 	 	the	 cri 	 es 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	.
women	have	 manifest 	 ed 	 	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	the	strength	 ari 	 s 	 ing 	 	from	 compass 	 ion 	 	in	an	 un 	 filter 	 ed 	 	,	 un 	 mediate 	 d 	 	way	in	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	.
they	have	 in 	 fused 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	with	 kind 	 ness 	 	,	and	we	have	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	that	 a 	 s 	 	woman	after	woman	 ha 	 s 	 	stood	on	 th 	 is 	 	stage	in	the	past	day	and	a	half	.
and	they	have	 actual 	 ized 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	through	direct	action	.
jody	williams	 call 	 ed 	 	it	:	it	's	good	to	meditate	.
i	'm	sorry	,	you	've	got	to	do	a	little	bit	of	that	,	jody	.
step	back	,	give	your	mother	a	break	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
but	the	other	side	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	is	you	've	got	to	come	out	of	your	cave	.
you	have	to	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	like	asanga	did	,	who	was	looking	to	 real 	 ize 	 	maitreya	buddha	after	12	 year 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	cave	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	out	of	here	.	``
he	's	going	down	the	path	.
he	 s 	 ees 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	path	.
he	 look 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	dog	,	he	 drop 	 s 	 	to	his	 knee 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 ees 	 	that	the	dog	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	big	wound	on	 it 	 s 	 	leg	.
the	wound	is	just	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	maggots	.
he	 put 	 s 	 	out	his	tongue	in	order	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	maggots	,	so	 a 	 s 	 	not	to	harm	them	.
and	at	that	moment	,	the	dog	 transform 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	buddha	of	love	and	 kind 	 ness 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	women	and	 girl 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	have	to	partner	in	a	 power 	 ful 	 	way	with	men	--	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 father 	 s 	 	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 son 	 s 	 	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 brother 	 s 	 	,	with	the	 plumb 	 ers 	 	,	the	road	 build 	 ers 	 	,	the	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	,	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	with	our	 p 	 resident 	 	,	and	with	all	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
the	women	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	are	 lot 	 uses 	 	in	a	sea	of	fire	.
may	we	 actual 	 ize 	 	that	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	women	 every 	 where 	 	.
thank	you	.
