there	was	a	time	in	my	life	when	 every 	 thing 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	perfect	.
 every 	 where 	 	i	went	,	i	felt	at	home	.
 every 	 one 	 	i	met	,	i	felt	i	 k 	 new 	 	them	for	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	remember	.
and	i	want	to	share	with	you	how	i	came	to	that	place	and	what	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	since	i	left	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	it	 beg 	 an 	 	.
and	it	 raise 	 s 	 	an	existential	question	,	which	is	,	if	i	'm	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	experience	of	complete	 connect 	 ion 	 	and	full	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	why	am	i	not	visible	in	the	photograph	,	and	where	is	 th 	 is 	 	time	and	place	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	los	angeles	,	california	,	where	i	live	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	police	photo	.	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	my	car	.
we	're	less	than	a	mile	from	one	of	the	largest	 hospital 	 s 	 	in	los	angeles	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 cedar 	 s 	 	-	sinai	.
and	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	that	a	car	full	of	paramedics	on	 the 	 ir 	 	way	home	from	the	hospital	after	work	have	run	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 wreck 	 age 	 	,	and	they	've	 advise 	 d 	 	the	police	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 surviv 	 ors 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	car	,	that	the	driver	's	dead	,	that	i	'm	dead	.
and	the	police	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	fire	 depart 	 ment 	 	to	 arriv 	 e 	 	to	cut	 a 	 part 	 	the	vehicle	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	body	of	the	driver	.
and	when	they	do	,	they	find	that	 be 	 hind 	 	the	glass	,	they	find	me	.
and	my	skull	's	 crush 	 ed 	 	and	my	collar	bone	is	 crush 	 ed 	 	;	all	but	two	of	my	 rib 	 s 	 	,	my	 pel 	 vis 	 	and	both	 arm 	 s 	 	--	they	're	all	 crush 	 ed 	 	,	but	there	is	still	a	 puls 	 e 	 	.
and	they	get	me	to	that	 near 	 by 	 	hospital	,	 cedar 	 s 	 	-	sinai	,	where	that	night	i	 receiv 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	my	internal	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	,	45	 unit 	 s 	 	of	blood	--	which	 mean 	 s 	 	full	 replace 	 ments 	 	of	all	the	blood	in	me	--	before	they	're	able	to	 s 	 tau 	 nch 	 	the	flow	.
i	'm	put	on	full	life	support	,	and	i	have	a	massive	stroke	,	and	my	brain	 drop 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 com 	 a 	 	.
now	comas	are	 measur 	 ed 	 	on	a	scale	from	15	down	to	three	.
fifteen	is	a	mild	 com 	 a 	 	.	three	is	the	 deep 	 est 	 	.
and	if	you	look	,	you	'll	see	that	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	way	you	can	score	three	.
it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	there	's	no	sign	of	life	from	 out 	 side 	 	at	all	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	more	than	a	month	in	a	glasgow	 com 	 a 	 	scale	three	,	and	it	is	 in 	 side 	 	that	 deep 	 est 	 	level	of	 com 	 a 	 	,	on	the	rim	between	my	life	and	my	death	,	that	i	'm	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	the	full	 connect 	 ion 	 	and	full	 conscious 	 ness 	 	of	inner	space	.
from	my	family	looking	in	from	 out 	 side 	 	,	what	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	is	a	different	kind	of	existential	question	,	which	is	,	how	far	is	it	going	to	be	possible	to	bridge	from	the	 com 	 at 	 ose 	 	potential	mind	that	they	're	looking	at	to	an	actual	mind	,	which	i	define	 simpl 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 function 	 ing 	 	of	the	brain	that	is	 remain 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	my	head	.
now	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 broad 	 er 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	i	want	you	to	imagine	that	you	are	an	 e 	 ternal 	 	alien	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	earth	from	 out 	 er 	 	space	,	and	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	show	on	 inter 	 galactic 	 	satellite	 tele 	 vision 	 	is	the	earth	channel	,	and	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	show	is	the	human	show	.
and	the	reason	i	think	it	would	be	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	you	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	so	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	and	so	fragile	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	 beg 	 an 	 	.
we	all	 beg 	 an 	 	in	the	awash	 val 	 ley 	 	in	ethiopia	.
the	show	 beg 	 an 	 	with	tremendous	special	 effect 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	climate	 shift 	 s 	 	--	which	sort	of	 sound 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	parallel	to	 to 	 day 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	earth	 tilt 	 ing 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	axis	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	climate	 shift 	 s 	 	,	we	had	to	figure	out	how	to	find	better	food	,	and	we	had	to	learn	--	there	's	lucy	;	that	's	how	we	all	 beg 	 an 	 	--	we	had	to	learn	how	to	crack	open	animal	 bone 	 s 	 	,	use	 tool 	 s 	 	to	do	that	,	to	feed	on	the	 mar 	 row 	 	,	to	grow	our	 brain 	 s 	 	more	.
so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	grew	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	global	threat	.
now	you	 al 	 so 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	watch	 a 	 s 	 	 conscious 	 ness 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	the	point	that	here	in	india	,	in	madhya	pradesh	,	there	's	one	of	the	two	 old 	 est 	 	known	 piece 	 s 	 	of	rock	art	found	.
it	's	a	cupule	that	took	40	to	50,000	 blow 	 s 	 	with	a	stone	tool	to	create	,	and	it	's	the	first	known	 express 	 ion 	 	of	art	on	the	planet	.
and	the	reason	it	 connect 	 s 	 	us	with	 conscious 	 ness 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	all	of	us	still	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	shape	we	draw	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	is	a	circle	.
and	then	the	next	thing	we	do	is	we	put	a	dot	in	the	center	of	the	circle	.
we	create	an	eye	--	and	the	eye	that	 evolve 	 s 	 	through	all	of	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
there	's	the	egyptian	god	horus	,	which	 symbol 	 ize 	 s 	 	 prosper 	 ity 	 	,	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	health	.
and	that	 come 	 s 	 	down	right	way	to	the	present	with	the	dollar	bill	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	on	it	an	eye	of	providence	.
so	 watch 	 ing 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	show	from	 out 	 er 	 	space	,	you	think	we	get	it	,	we	understand	that	the	most	precious	resource	on	the	blue	planet	is	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	first	thing	we	draw	;	we	surround	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	 image 	 s 	 	of	it	;	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	common	image	on	the	planet	.
but	we	do	n't	.	we	take	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
while	i	was	producing	in	los	angeles	,	i	never	thought	about	it	for	a	second	.
 un 	 til 	 	it	was	 strip 	 ped 	 	from	me	,	i	never	thought	about	it	.
and	what	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	since	that	event	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	is	that	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	under	threat	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	in	ways	it	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	under	threat	before	.
these	are	just	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
and	the	reason	i	'm	so	 honor 	 ed 	 	to	be	here	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	in	india	is	 be 	 cause 	 	india	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ad 	 	 distinct 	 ion 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	the	head	 in 	 jury 	 	capital	of	the	world	.
that	statistic	is	so	 s 	 ad 	 	.
there	is	no	more	drastic	and	sudden	gap	 create 	 d 	 	between	potential	and	actual	mind	than	a	severe	head	 in 	 jury 	 	.
each	one	can	 en 	 tail 	 	up	to	a	decade	of	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	india	,	 un 	 less 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 change 	 s 	 	,	is	 accumul 	 ating 	 	a	need	for	millennia	of	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	.
what	you	find	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	an	 in 	 jury 	 	every	20	 second 	 s 	 	--	that	's	one	and	a	half	million	every	year	--	stroke	every	40	 second 	 s 	 	,	alzheimer	's	disease	,	every	70	 second 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 succumb 	 s 	 	to	that	.
all	of	these	represent	 gap 	 s 	 	between	potential	mind	and	actual	mind	.
and	here	are	some	of	the	other	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	whole	planet	.
the	world	health	 organ 	 ization 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	 depress 	 ion 	 	is	the	number	one	disease	on	earth	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	lived	with	 dis 	 ability 	 	.
we	find	that	the	number	two	source	of	 dis 	 ability 	 	is	 depress 	 ion 	 	in	the	age	group	of	15	to	44	.
our	children	are	 be 	 coming 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	at	an	 alarm 	 ing 	 	rate	.
i	 discover 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	the	third	 lead 	 ing 	 	cause	of	death	 among 	 st 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	is	 su 	 icide 	 	.
if	you	look	at	some	of	these	other	 item 	 s 	 	--	 concuss 	 ions 	 	.
half	of	e.r	.	 ad 	 mission 	 s 	 	from	 adolescent 	 s 	 	are	for	 concuss 	 ions 	 	.
if	i	talk	about	migraine	,	40	percent	of	the	population	suffer	episodic	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	.
fifteen	percent	suffer	 migraine 	 s 	 	that	wipe	them	out	for	 day 	 s 	 	on	end	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 lead 	 ing 	 	--	computer	 addict 	 ion 	 	,	just	to	cover	that	:	the	most	frequent	thing	we	do	is	use	digital	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
the	average	teenager	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	3,300	 text 	 s 	 	every	[	month	]	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	is	 re 	 treat 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	 dis 	 associ 	 ation 	 	when	we	are	 potential 	 ly 	 	 confront 	 ing 	 	the	next	great	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	climate	shift	.
so	what	you	'd	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	human	show	,	is	are	we	going	to	confront	and	address	the	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	climate	shift	that	may	be	 head 	 ing 	 	our	way	by	growing	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	or	are	we	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 re 	 treat 	 	?
and	that	then	might	lead	you	to	watch	an	episode	one	day	of	 cedar 	 s 	 	-	sinai	medical	center	and	a	 consider 	 ation 	 	of	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	potential	mind	and	actual	mind	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dense	array	eeg	mri	 track 	 ing 	 	156	 channel 	 s 	 	of	information	.
it	's	not	my	eeg	at	 cedar 	 s 	 	;	it	's	your	eeg	 to 	 night 	 	and	last	night	.
it	's	the	what	our	 mind 	 s 	 	do	every	night	to	digest	the	day	and	to	 prep 	 are 	 	to	bridge	from	the	potential	mind	when	we	're	 a 	 sleep 	 	to	the	actual	mind	when	we	 awake 	 n 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	i	was	when	i	 return 	 ed 	 	from	the	hospital	after	 near 	 ly 	 	four	 month 	 s 	 	.
the	 horse 	 shoe 	 	shape	you	can	see	on	my	skull	is	where	they	 oper 	 ated 	 	and	went	 in 	 side 	 	my	brain	to	do	the	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	to	 rescu 	 e 	 	my	life	.
but	if	you	look	 in 	 to 	 	the	eye	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	that	single	eye	you	can	see	,	i	'm	looking	down	,	but	let	me	tell	you	how	i	felt	at	that	point	.
i	did	n't	feel	empty	;	i	felt	 every 	 thing 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
i	felt	empty	and	full	,	hot	and	cold	,	euphoric	and	 depress 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	brain	is	the	world	's	first	fully	functional	 quant 	 um 	 	computer	;	it	can	occupy	 multi 	 ple 	 	 state 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
and	with	all	the	internal	 regulat 	 ors 	 	of	my	brain	 damage 	 d 	 	,	i	felt	 every 	 thing 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
but	let	's	swivel	around	and	look	at	me	 frontal 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	now	flash	-	forward	to	the	point	in	time	where	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 dis 	 charged 	 	by	the	health	system	.
look	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	not	able	to	focus	 t 	 hose 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	able	to	follow	a	line	of	text	in	a	book	.
but	the	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	me	on	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	my	family	 start 	 ed 	 	to	discover	,	there	is	no	long	-	term	 con 	 cept 	 	in	the	health	care	system	.
 neuro 	 logical 	 	damage	,	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	rehab	,	 requir 	 es 	 	a	long	-	term	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
but	let	's	take	a	look	 be 	 hind 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 gam 	 ma 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	spec	 s 	 can 	 	that	uses	 gam 	 ma 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	to	map	three	-	dimensional	function	 with 	 in 	 	the	brain	.
it	 requir 	 es 	 	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	to	see	it	in	three	dimension	,	but	in	two	 dimension 	 s 	 	i	think	you	can	see	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	symmetry	and	 illumi 	 nation 	 	of	a	normal	mind	at	work	.
here	's	my	brain	.
that	is	the	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	more	than	a	third	of	the	right	side	of	my	brain	 be 	 ing 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	the	stroke	.
so	my	family	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 move 	 d 	 	forward	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	the	health	care	system	had	 move 	 d 	 	us	by	,	had	to	try	to	find	 solution 	 s 	 	and	 answer 	 s 	 	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	process	--	it	took	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	--	one	of	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	my	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	,	my	degree	of	advance	,	since	the	amount	of	head	 in 	 jury 	 	i	'd	 suffer 	 ed 	 	,	was	 miracul 	 ous 	 	.
and	that	was	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	write	a	book	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	think	it	was	 miracul 	 ous 	 	.
i	thought	there	 we 	 re 	 	 miracul 	 ous 	 	 element 	 s 	 	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	did	n't	think	it	was	right	that	one	should	have	to	struggle	and	search	for	 answer 	 s 	 	when	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	 with 	 in 	 	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
so	from	 th 	 is 	 	experience	of	my	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	,	i	want	to	share	four	 part 	 icular 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	--	i	call	them	the	four	c	's	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	--	that	 help 	 ed 	 	me	grow	my	potential	mind	back	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	actual	mind	that	i	work	with	every	day	.
the	first	c	is	cognitive	training	.
 un 	 like 	 	the	 s 	 mash 	 ed 	 	glass	of	my	car	,	 plastic 	 ity 	 	of	the	brain	 mean 	 s 	 	that	there	was	 al 	 ways 	 	a	 possibil 	 ity 	 	,	with	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	to	train	the	brain	so	that	you	can	regain	and	raise	your	level	of	 aware 	 ness 	 	and	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
 plastic 	 ity 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	there	was	 al 	 ways 	 	hope	for	our	reason	--	hope	for	our	ability	to	 re 	 build 	 	that	function	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	mind	can	 re 	 define 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 demonst 	 rated 	 	by	two	 special 	 ists 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	hagen	and	silva	back	in	the	1970	's	.
the	global	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	is	that	up	to	30	percent	of	children	in	school	have	 learn 	 ing 	 	 weak 	 ness 	 es 	 	that	are	not	self	-	 correct 	 ing 	 	,	but	with	appropriate	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	they	can	be	 screen 	 ed 	 	for	and	 detect 	 ed 	 	and	 correct 	 ed 	 	and	avoid	 the 	 ir 	 	academic	failure	.
but	what	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	find	 any 	 one 	 	who	 provide 	 s 	 	that	 treat 	 ment 	 	or	care	.
here	's	what	my	 neuro 	 psycho 	 logist 	 	 provide 	 d 	 	for	me	when	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	 some 	 body 	 	who	could	 app 	 ly 	 	it	.
i	'm	not	a	doctor	,	so	i	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	subtests	.
let	's	just	talk	about	full	-	scale	i.q	.
full	-	scale	i.q	.	is	the	mental	 process 	 ing 	 	--	how	fast	you	can	 acquir 	 e 	 	information	,	retain	it	and	retrieve	it	--	that	is	essential	for	success	in	life	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	you	can	see	here	there	are	three	 column 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 test 	 able 	 	--	that	's	when	i	'm	in	my	 com 	 a 	 	.
and	then	i	creep	up	to	the	point	that	i	get	a	score	of	79	,	which	is	just	 be 	 low 	 	average	.
in	the	health	care	system	,	if	you	touch	average	,	you	're	 d 	 one 	 	.
that	's	when	i	was	 dis 	 charged 	 	from	the	system	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	average	i.q	.	 re 	 ally 	 	mean	?
it	 me 	 ant 	 	that	when	i	was	 give 	 n 	 	two	and	a	half	 hour 	 s 	 	to	take	a	test	that	 any 	 one 	 	here	would	take	in	50	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	might	score	an	f	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	low	level	in	order	to	be	 kick 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	health	care	system	.
then	i	 under 	 went 	 	cognitive	training	.
and	let	me	show	you	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	right	-	hand	column	when	i	did	my	cognitive	training	over	a	period	of	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	occur	.
i.q	.	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 stabil 	 ize 	 	and	 solid 	 ify 	 	at	the	age	of	eight	.
now	the	journal	of	the	national	medical	 associ 	 ation 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	my	memoir	a	full	 clinic 	 al 	 	review	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	.
i	'm	not	a	doctor	.	i	have	no	medical	 back 	 ground 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
but	they	felt	the	 evidence 	 s 	 	that	there	was	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 valu 	 able 	 	information	in	the	book	,	and	they	 comment 	 ed 	 	about	it	when	they	 g 	 ave 	 	the	full	peer	review	to	it	.
but	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	one	question	.	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	 repeat 	 able 	 	?	``
that	was	a	fair	question	 be 	 cause 	 	my	memoir	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	how	i	found	 solution 	 s 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	for	me	.
the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	,	and	for	the	first	time	,	it	's	my	pleasure	to	be	able	to	share	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
here	's	 some 	 body 	 	,	what	they	did	 a 	 s 	 	they	went	through	cognitive	training	at	 age 	 s 	 	seven	and	11	.
and	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	person	in	,	call	it	,	high	school	and	college	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	person	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	intrascatter	that	's	in	the	subtests	,	but	they	still	had	a	 neuro 	 logic 	 	issue	.
but	that	person	could	be	identified	 a 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 learn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 ability 	 	.
and	with	 accommo 	 d 	 ation 	 	,	they	went	on	to	college	and	had	a	full	life	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
second	 a 	 spect 	 	:	i	still	had	 crush 	 ing 	 	migraine	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	.
two	 element 	 s 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	for	me	here	are	--	the	first	is	90	percent	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	of	head	and	neck	pain	is	through	 mus 	 cular 	 	-	skeletal	 im 	 balance 	 	.
the	craniomandibular	system	is	critical	to	that	.
and	when	i	 under 	 went 	 	it	and	found	 solution 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 inter 	 relationship 	 	between	the	tmj	and	the	 tee 	 th 	 	.
up	to	30	percent	of	the	population	have	a	 dis 	 order 	 	,	disease	or	 dy 	 s 	 function 	 	in	the	jaw	that	 affect 	 s 	 	the	entire	body	.
i	was	fortunate	to	find	a	 dent 	 ist 	 	who	 appli 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	entire	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	technology	you	're	about	to	see	to	establish	that	if	he	repositioned	my	jaw	,	the	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	resolved	,	but	that	then	my	 tee 	 th 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	in	the	right	place	.
he	then	held	my	jaw	in	the	right	position	while	orthodontically	he	put	my	 tee 	 th 	 	 in 	 to 	 	correct	 align 	 ment 	 	.
so	my	 tee 	 th 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	hold	my	jaw	in	the	correct	position	.
 th 	 is 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	my	entire	body	.
if	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	thing	to	say	and	 ra 	 ther 	 	a	bold	 state 	 ment 	 	--	how	can	the	jaw	affect	the	entire	body	?	--	let	me	 simpl 	 y 	 	point	out	to	you	,	if	i	ask	you	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	to	put	one	grain	of	sand	between	your	 tee 	 th 	 	and	go	for	a	nice	long	walk	,	how	far	would	you	last	before	you	had	to	 re 	 move 	 	that	grain	of	sand	?
that	 tin 	 y 	 	misalignment	.
bear	in	mind	,	there	are	no	 nerve 	 s 	 	in	the	 tee 	 th 	 	.
that	's	why	the	same	between	the	before	and	after	that	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	,	it	's	hard	to	see	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
now	just	 try 	 ing 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	a	few	 grain 	 s 	 	of	sand	between	your	 tee 	 th 	 	and	see	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	.
i	still	had	migraine	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	.
the	next	issue	that	resolved	was	that	,	if	90	percent	of	head	and	neck	pain	is	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 im 	 balance 	 	,	the	other	10	percent	,	 large 	 ly 	 	--	if	you	set	 a 	 side 	 	aneurysms	,	brain	cancer	and	hormonal	 issue 	 s 	 	--	is	the	 circul 	 ation 	 	.
imagine	the	blood	 flow 	 ing 	 	through	your	body	--	i	was	told	at	ucla	medical	center	--	 a 	 s 	 	one	 seal 	 ed 	 	system	.
there	's	a	big	pipe	with	the	blood	 flow 	 ing 	 	through	it	,	and	around	that	pipe	are	the	 nerve 	 s 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	nutrient	supply	from	the	blood	.
that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	.
if	you	press	on	a	hose	pipe	in	a	 seal 	 ed 	 	system	,	it	 bulg 	 es 	 	 some 	 place 	 	else	.
if	that	some	place	else	where	it	 bulg 	 es 	 	is	 in 	 side 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	nerve	in	your	body	,	your	brain	,	you	get	a	vascular	migraine	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	level	of	pain	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	known	to	other	people	who	suffer	vascular	 migraine 	 s 	 	.
using	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	mapping	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	mri	mra	mrv	,	a	 volu 	 metric 	 	mri	.
using	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	the	 special 	 ists 	 	at	ucla	medical	center	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	identify	where	that	 compress 	 ion 	 	in	the	hose	pipe	was	 occur 	 ring 	 	.
a	vascular	surgeon	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	most	of	the	first	rib	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	of	my	body	.
and	in	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 month 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	felt	the	 neuro 	 logical 	 	flow	of	life	 it 	 self 	 	 return 	 ing 	 	.
communication	,	the	next	c.	 th 	 is 	 	is	critical	.
all	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	about	communication	.
and	here	,	by	great	fortune	,	one	of	my	father	's	 client 	 s 	 	had	a	husband	who	 work 	 ed 	 	at	the	alfred	mann	 found 	 ation 	 	for	scientific	research	.
alfred	mann	is	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	physicist	and	 innov 	 ator 	 	who	's	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	 brid 	 ging 	 	 gap 	 s 	 	in	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	to	 re 	 store 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	to	the	deaf	,	vision	to	the	blind	or	 move 	 ment 	 	to	the	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
and	i	'm	just	going	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	 to 	 day 	 	of	 move 	 ment 	 	to	the	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
i	've	 br 	 ought 	 	with	me	,	from	southern	california	,	the	fm	 de 	 vice 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	it	 be 	 ing 	 	held	in	the	hand	.
it	 weigh 	 s 	 	less	than	a	gram	.
so	two	of	them	 implant 	 ed 	 	in	the	body	would	weigh	less	than	a	 di 	 me 	 	.
five	of	them	would	still	weigh	less	than	a	rupee	 co 	 in 	 	.
where	 do 	 es 	 	it	go	 in 	 side 	 	the	body	?
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 simul 	 ated 	 	and	tested	to	 endur 	 e 	 	in	the	body	 corros 	 ion 	 	-	free	for	over	80	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 go 	 es 	 	in	and	it	 stay 	 s 	 	there	.
here	are	the	 implant 	 ation 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	.
the	 con 	 cept 	 	that	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	--	and	they	have	 work 	 ing 	 	 prototype 	 s 	 	--	is	that	we	 place 	 d 	 	it	 through 	 out 	 	the	motor	 point 	 s 	 	of	the	body	where	they	're	 need 	 ed 	 	.
the	main	unit	will	then	go	 in 	 side 	 	the	brain	.
an	fm	 de 	 vice 	 	in	the	cortex	of	the	brain	,	the	motor	cortex	,	will	 s 	 end 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	in	real	time	to	the	motor	 point 	 s 	 	in	the	relevant	 muscle 	 s 	 	so	that	the	person	will	be	able	to	move	 the 	 ir 	 	arm	,	let	's	say	,	in	real	time	,	if	they	've	lost	control	of	 the 	 ir 	 	arm	.
and	other	fm	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	 implant 	 ed 	 	in	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	,	on	 contact 	 ing 	 	a	surface	,	will	 s 	 end 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	back	to	the	 sensor 	 y 	 	cortex	of	the	brain	,	so	that	the	person	 feel 	 s 	 	a	sense	of	touch	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	science	fiction	?	no	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	the	first	application	of	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
i	do	n't	have	the	ability	to	control	my	left	foot	.
a	radio	 de 	 vice 	 	is	 controll 	 ing 	 	every	step	i	take	,	and	a	sensor	 pick 	 s 	 	up	my	foot	for	me	every	time	i	walk	.
and	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	i	want	to	share	the	personal	reason	why	 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	so	much	to	me	and	 change 	 d 	 	the	direction	of	my	life	.
in	my	 com 	 a 	 	,	one	of	the	 presence 	 s 	 	i	 sens 	 ed 	 	was	 some 	 one 	 	i	felt	was	a	 protect 	 or 	 	.
and	when	i	came	out	of	my	 com 	 a 	 	,	i	 recogn 	 ized 	 	my	family	,	but	i	did	n't	remember	my	own	past	.
 gradu 	 ally 	 	,	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	the	 protect 	 or 	 	was	my	wife	.
and	i	 whisper 	 ed 	 	the	good	news	through	my	broken	jaw	,	which	was	wired	shut	,	to	my	night	nurse	.
and	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	my	mother	came	to	explain	that	i	'd	not	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	bed	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	that	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	film	and	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	that	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	crash	and	that	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	was	married	,	but	marcy	had	 be 	 en 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	 instant 	 ly 	 	in	the	crash	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	time	in	 com 	 a 	 	,	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	laid	to	rest	in	her	 home 	 town 	 	of	phoenix	.
now	in	the	dark	 year 	 s 	 	that	 follow 	 ed 	 	,	i	had	to	work	out	what	 remain 	 ed 	 	for	me	if	 every 	 thing 	 	that	made	 to 	 day 	 	special	was	gone	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	these	 threat 	 s 	 	to	 conscious 	 ness 	 	and	how	they	are	 surround 	 ing 	 	the	world	and	 envelop 	 ing 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	more	and	more	people	every	day	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	what	 tru 	 ly 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	can	 over 	 come 	 	the	 threat 	 s 	 	to	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	that	the	human	show	can	stay	on	the	air	for	millennia	to	come	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	can	all	rise	and	shine	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
lakshmi	pratury	:	just	stay	for	a	second	.	just	stay	here	for	a	second	.
you	know	,	when	i	heard	simon	's	--	 pleas 	 e 	 	 s 	 it 	 	down	;	i	just	want	to	talk	to	him	for	a	second	--	when	i	read	his	book	,	i	went	to	la	to	meet	him	.
and	so	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	restaurant	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	a	man	to	come	by	who	 obvious 	 ly 	 	would	have	some	 difficult 	 y 	 	...
i	do	n't	know	what	i	had	in	my	mind	.
and	he	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	.
i	did	n't	expect	that	person	that	i	was	going	to	meet	to	be	him	.
and	then	we	met	and	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	'm	like	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	 some 	 body 	 	who	was	built	out	of	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	i	was	 amaz 	 ed 	 	at	what	role	technology	 play 	 ed 	 	in	your	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
and	we	have	his	book	 out 	 side 	 	in	the	 book 	 shop 	 	.
the	thing	that	 amaz 	 ed 	 	me	is	the	 pain 	 s 	 taking 	 	detail	with	which	he	 ha 	 s 	 	written	every	hospital	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	,	every	 treat 	 ment 	 	he	got	,	every	near	-	 mis 	 s 	 	he	had	,	and	how	 accident 	 ally 	 	he	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	.
so	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	one	detail	went	past	people	 re 	 ally 	 	quick	.
tell	a	little	bit	about	what	you	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	on	your	leg	.
simon	lewis	:	i	 k 	 new 	 	when	i	was	 tim 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	that	there	would	n't	be	time	for	me	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	about	--	well	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	control	unit	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 record 	 s 	 	every	single	step	i	've	taken	for	,	ooh	,	five	or	six	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
and	if	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	mic	wo	n't	hear	it	.
that	little	chirp	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	two	 chirp 	 s 	 	is	now	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	on	.
when	i	press	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	'll	chirp	three	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	that	'll	mean	that	it	's	 arm 	 ed 	 	and	ready	to	go	.
and	that	's	my	friend	.	i	mean	,	i	charge	it	every	night	.
and	it	 work 	 s 	 	.	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	would	love	to	add	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	have	time	...
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	do	?	well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	'll	show	you	down	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	down	here	,	if	the	camera	can	see	that	,	that	is	a	small	antenna	.
 under 	 neath 	 	my	heel	,	there	is	a	sensor	that	 detect 	 s 	 	when	my	foot	 leav 	 es 	 	the	ground	--	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	heel	lift	.
 th 	 is 	 	thing	 blink 	 s 	 	all	the	time	;	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	it	out	,	so	you	might	be	able	to	see	it	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 blink 	 ing 	 	all	the	time	.	it	's	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	in	real	time	.
and	if	you	walk	 fast 	 er 	 	,	if	i	walk	 fast 	 er 	 	,	it	 detect 	 s 	 	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	time	 inter 	 val 	 	,	which	is	the	 inter 	 val 	 	between	each	heel	lift	.
and	it	 accele 	 rates 	 	the	amount	and	level	of	the	 stimul 	 ation 	 	.
the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	they	've	 work 	 ed 	 	on	--	i	did	n't	have	time	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	talk	--	is	they	've	 resto 	 red 	 	functional	 hear 	 ing 	 	to	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	deaf	people	.
i	could	tell	you	the	story	:	 th 	 is 	 	was	going	to	be	an	 abandon 	 ed 	 	technology	,	but	alfred	mann	met	the	doctor	who	was	going	to	retire	,	[	dr.	schindler	.	]	and	he	was	going	to	retire	--	all	the	technology	was	going	to	be	lost	,	 be 	 cause 	 	not	a	single	medical	 manufactur 	 er 	 	would	take	it	on	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	small	issue	.
but	there	's	 million 	 s 	 	of	deaf	people	in	the	world	,	and	the	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	to	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	deaf	people	now	.
it	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	the	other	thing	is	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	artificial	 retina 	 s 	 	for	the	blind	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 implant 	 able 	 	generation	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	i	did	n't	say	in	my	talk	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	exoskeletal	.
i	should	 clar 	 ify 	 	that	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	first	generation	is	exoskeletal	,	it	's	 wrap 	 ped 	 	around	the	leg	,	around	the	 affect 	 ed 	 	limb	.
i	must	tell	you	,	they	're	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	--	there	's	a	hundred	people	who	work	in	that	building	--	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	other	team	 member 	 s 	 	--	all	the	time	.
alfred	mann	 ha 	 s 	 	set	up	 th 	 is 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	to	advance	 th 	 is 	 	research	 be 	 cause 	 	he	saw	there	's	no	way	venture	capital	would	come	in	for	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	audience	is	too	small	.
you	'd	think	,	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 paralyze 	 d 	 	people	in	the	world	,	but	the	audience	is	too	small	,	and	the	amount	of	research	,	the	time	it	 take 	 s 	 	,	the	fda	clearances	,	the	 pay 	 back 	 	time	is	too	long	for	v.c	.	to	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
so	he	saw	a	need	and	he	 steppe 	 d 	 	in	.
he	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	man	.
he	's	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	of	 ver 	 y 	 	cutting	-	edge	science	.
lp	:	so	when	you	get	a	chance	,	 s 	 pend 	 	some	time	with	simon	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
