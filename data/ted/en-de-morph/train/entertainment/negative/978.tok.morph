it	was	25	 minute 	 s 	 	of	absolute	terror	that	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	 a 	 cross 	 	the	u.s.	felt	.
i	was	 af 	 raid 	 	of	a	tsunami	;	what	i	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	was	there	was	a	 great 	 er 	 	terror	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	and	that	was	building	collapse	.
we	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	the	 photo 	 s 	 	of	the	 collapse 	 d 	 	 building 	 s 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	.
these	are	 shot 	 s 	 	my	wife	took	a	couple	 day 	 s 	 	after	the	quake	,	while	i	was	making	my	way	through	the	d.r	.	 in 	 to 	 	the	country	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	national	 pa 	 lace 	 	--	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	white	house	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	 economic 	 s 	 	and	finance	.
we	have	all	heard	about	the	tremendous	human	loss	in	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	but	we	have	n't	heard	 en 	 ough 	 	about	why	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	lost	.
we	have	n't	heard	about	why	the	 building 	 s 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
after	all	,	it	was	the	 building 	 s 	 	,	not	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	,	that	 kill 	 ed 	 	220,000	people	,	that	 inju 	 red 	 	330,000	,	that	 dis 	 place 	 d 	 	1.3	million	people	,	that	cut	off	food	and	water	and	 suppli 	 es 	 	for	an	entire	nation	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	largest	 metro 	 politan 	 	-	area	disaster	in	 decade 	 s 	 	,	and	it	was	not	a	natural	disaster	--	it	was	a	disaster	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.

and	after	the	quake	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	 earth 	 quake 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	to	figure	out	why	the	 building 	 s 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	,	to	examine	what	was	safe	and	what	was	n't	.
 work 	 ing 	 	with	minustah	,	which	is	the	u.n.	mission	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	with	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	public	 work 	 s 	 	,	with	different	ngos	,	we	 inspect 	 ed 	 	over	1,500	 building 	 s 	 	.
we	 inspect 	 ed 	 	 school 	 s 	 	and	private	 re 	 side 	 ncies 	 	.
we	 inspect 	 ed 	 	medical	 center 	 s 	 	and	food	 ware 	 house 	 s 	 	.
we	 inspect 	 ed 	 	government	 building 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	justice	.
 be 	 hind 	 	that	door	is	the	national	 judi 	 cial 	 	 archiv 	 es 	 	.
the	fellow	in	the	door	,	andre	filitrault	--	who	's	the	director	of	the	center	for	 inter 	 disciplinary 	 	 earth 	 quake 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	research	at	the	university	of	buffalo	--	was	 exa 	 min 	 ing 	 	it	to	see	if	it	was	safe	to	 re 	 cover 	 	the	 archiv 	 es 	 	.
andre	told	me	,	after	 see 	 ing 	 	these	 building 	 s 	 	fail	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	in	the	same	way	,	that	there	is	no	new	research	here	.
there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	here	that	we	do	n't	know	.
the	failure	 point 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	same	:	 wall 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 lab 	 s 	 	not	 ti 	 ed 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 column 	 s 	 	--	that	's	a	roof	 s 	 lab 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	off	the	building	--	 c 	 anti 	 lever 	 ed 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	,	or	 structure 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 symmetric 	 	,	that	 s 	 hook 	 	 violent 	 ly 	 	and	came	down	,	poor	building	 material 	 s 	 	,	not	 en 	 ough 	 	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	,	not	 en 	 ough 	 	 compress 	 ion 	 	in	the	 block 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 bar 	 	that	was	smooth	,	 re 	 bar 	 	that	was	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	the	weather	and	had	 rust 	 ed 	 	away	.
now	there	's	a	solution	to	all	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	we	know	how	to	build	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
the	proof	of	 th 	 is 	 	came	in	chile	,	 al 	 most 	 	a	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	8.8	 magn 	 itude 	 	 earth 	 quake 	 	hit	chile	.
that	is	500	 time 	 s 	 	the	power	of	the	7.0	that	hit	port	-	au	-	prince	--	500	 time 	 s 	 	the	power	,	yet	 on 	 ly 	 	under	a	thousand	 casual 	 ties 	 	.
 adjust 	 ed 	 	for	population	density	,	that	is	less	than	one	percent	of	the	impact	of	the	haitian	quake	.
what	was	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	chile	and	 ha 	 iti 	 	?
 s 	 e 	 ism 	 ic 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	and	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	 mason 	 ry 	 	,	where	the	building	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	--	 wall 	 s 	 	and	 column 	 s 	 	and	 roof 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 lab 	 s 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	together	to	support	each	other	--	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 break 	 ing 	 	off	 in 	 to 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	 member 	 s 	 	and	 fail 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	building	in	chile	,	it	's	 rip 	 ped 	 	in	half	,	but	it	's	not	a	pile	of	 rub 	 ble 	 	.
chileans	have	 be 	 en 	 	building	with	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	 mason 	 ry 	 	for	 decade 	 s 	 	.
right	now	,	aidg	is	 work 	 ing 	 	with	kpff	 consult 	 ing 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 architect 	 ure 	 	for	 human 	 ity 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	more	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	 mason 	 ry 	 	training	 in 	 to 	 	 ha 	 iti 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	xantus	daniel	;	he	's	a	mason	,	just	a	general	construction	 work 	 er 	 	,	not	a	 fore 	 man 	 	,	who	took	one	of	our	 training 	 s 	 	.
on	his	last	job	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	his	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 pour 	 ing 	 	the	 column 	 s 	 	wrong	.
he	took	his	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	 a 	 side 	 	,	and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	him	the	 material 	 s 	 	on	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	 mason 	 ry 	 	.
he	 show 	 ed 	 	him	,	``	you	know	,	we	do	n't	have	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	wrong	.
it	wo	n't	cost	us	any	more	to	do	it	the	right	way	.	``
and	they	 re 	 did 	 	that	building	.
they	 ti 	 ed 	 	the	 re 	 bar 	 	right	,	they	 pour 	 ed 	 	the	 column 	 s 	 	right	,	and	that	building	will	be	safe	.
and	every	building	that	they	build	going	forward	will	be	safe	.
to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	these	 building 	 s 	 	are	safe	,	it	's	not	going	to	take	policy	--	it	's	going	to	take	 reach 	 ing 	 	out	to	the	 mason 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	and	 help 	 ing 	 	them	learn	the	proper	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
now	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 group 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	fellow	in	the	vest	there	,	craig	toten	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	forward	to	get	 document 	 ation 	 	out	to	all	the	 group 	 s 	 	that	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
through	 ha 	 iti 	 	 re 	 wired 	 	,	through	build	change	,	 architect 	 ure 	 	for	 human 	 ity 	 	,	aidg	,	there	is	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	reach	out	to	30,000	--	40,000	 mason 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	and	create	a	 move 	 ment 	 	of	proper	building	.
if	you	reach	out	to	the	people	on	the	ground	in	 th 	 is 	 	 collabor 	 ative 	 	way	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 afford 	 able 	 	.
for	the	 billion 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	on	 re 	 construction 	 	,	you	can	train	 mason 	 s 	 	for	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	every	house	that	they	end	up	building	over	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 time 	 	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	there	are	two	ways	that	you	can	 re 	 build 	 	 ha 	 iti 	 	;	the	way	at	the	top	is	the	way	that	 ha 	 iti 	 	's	 be 	 en 	 	building	for	 decade 	 s 	 	.
the	way	at	the	top	is	a	 poor 	 ly 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	building	that	will	fail	.
the	way	at	the	bottom	is	a	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	 mason 	 ry 	 	building	,	where	the	 wall 	 s 	 	are	 ti 	 ed 	 	together	,	the	building	is	symmetric	,	and	it	will	stand	up	to	an	 earth 	 quake 	 	.
for	all	the	disaster	,	there	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	here	to	build	better	 house 	 s 	 	for	the	next	generation	,	so	that	when	the	next	 earth 	 quake 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	,	it	is	a	disaster	--	but	not	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
