hi	.
i	did	that	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	you	a	good	visual	first	impression	.
but	the	main	reason	i	did	it	is	that	that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	me	when	i	'm	 force 	 d 	 	to	wear	a	 lad 	 y 	 	gaga	skanky	mic	.
i	'm	used	to	a	 station 	 ary 	 	mic	.
it	's	the	 sens 	 ible 	 	shoe	of	public	address	.
but	you	 clam 	 p 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	on	my	head	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
i	just	 be 	 come 	 	skanky	.
so	i	'm	sorry	about	that	.
and	i	'm	 al 	 ready 	 	off	-	 mess 	 age 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	i	have	 devote 	 d 	 	the	past	25	 year 	 s 	 	of	my	life	to	 design 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
``	 y 	 es 	 	,	 book 	 s 	 	.	you	know	,	the	bound	 volume 	 s 	 	with	ink	on	paper	.
you	can	not	turn	them	off	with	a	 s 	 witch 	 	.
tell	your	 kid 	 s 	 	.	``
it	all	sort	of	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	benign	 mistak 	 e 	 	,	like	 pen 	 icillin 	 	.
what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	was	to	be	a	graphic	 design 	 er 	 	at	one	of	the	big	design	 firm 	 s 	 	in	new	york	city	.
but	 up 	 on 	 	 arriv 	 al 	 	there	,	in	the	fall	of	1986	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 interview 	 s 	 	,	i	found	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	i	was	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	was	to	be	 assist 	 ant 	 	to	the	art	director	at	alfred	a.	knopf	,	a	book	 publish 	 er 	 	.
now	i	was	stupid	,	but	not	so	stupid	that	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	down	.
i	had	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	idea	what	i	was	about	to	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	,	and	i	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	.
soon	,	it	had	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	what	my	job	was	.
my	job	was	to	ask	 th 	 is 	 	question	:	``	what	do	the	 st 	 ories 	 	look	like	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	what	knopf	is	.
it	is	the	story	 factor 	 y 	 	,	one	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	in	the	world	.
we	 br 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	to	the	public	.
the	 st 	 ories 	 	can	be	 any 	 thing 	 	,	and	some	of	them	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	true	.
but	they	all	have	one	thing	in	common	:	they	all	need	to	look	like	 some 	 thing 	 	.
they	all	need	a	face	.
why	?	to	give	you	a	first	impression	of	what	you	are	about	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	.
a	book	 design 	 er 	 	 give 	 s 	 	form	to	content	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 manage 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	balance	between	the	two	.
now	,	the	first	day	of	my	graphic	design	training	at	penn	state	university	,	the	teacher	,	lanny	sommese	,	came	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	and	he	drew	a	picture	of	an	apple	on	the	 black 	 board 	 	,	and	wrote	the	word	``	apple	``	 under 	 neath 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ok	.	 less 	 on 	 	one	.	listen	up	.	``
and	he	 cover 	 ed 	 	up	the	picture	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	either	say	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	and	then	he	 cover 	 ed 	 	up	the	word	,	``	or	you	show	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	you	do	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 treat 	 ing 	 	your	audience	like	a	moron	.
and	they	deserve	better	.
and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	soon	 en 	 ough 	 	,	i	was	able	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	to	the	test	on	two	 book 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	for	knopf	.
the	first	was	katharine	hepburn	's	 memoir 	 s 	 	,	and	the	second	was	a	 bio 	 graphy 	 	of	marlene	dietrich	.
now	the	hepburn	book	was	written	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 conversation 	 al 	 	style	,	it	was	like	she	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	a	table	 tell 	 ing 	 	it	all	to	you	.
the	dietrich	book	was	an	 observ 	 ation 	 	by	her	daughter	;	it	was	a	 bio 	 graphy 	 	.
so	the	hepburn	story	is	 word 	 s 	 	and	the	dietrich	story	is	 picture 	 s 	 	,	and	so	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	there	you	are	.
 pur 	 e 	 	content	and	 pur 	 e 	 	form	,	side	by	side	.
no	 fight 	 ing 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	.
``	what	's	a	jurassic	park	?	``
now	,	what	is	the	story	here	?
 some 	 one 	 	is	re	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	by	 ex 	 tract 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	from	 pre 	 historic 	 	 am 	 ber 	 	.
 gen 	 ius 	 	!
now	,	 luck 	 ily 	 	for	me	,	i	live	and	work	in	new	york	city	,	where	there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	went	to	the	museum	of	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	i	 check 	 ed 	 	out	the	 bone 	 s 	 	,	and	i	went	to	the	gift	shop	,	and	i	 b 	 ought 	 	a	book	.
and	i	was	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	taken	with	 th 	 is 	 	page	of	the	book	,	and	more	 specific 	 ally 	 	the	lower	right	-	hand	corner	.
now	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	and	i	put	it	in	a	photostat	machine	,	and	i	took	a	piece	of	 trac 	 ing 	 	paper	,	and	i	taped	it	over	the	photostat	with	a	piece	of	 s 	 co 	 tch 	 	tape	--	stop	me	if	i	'm	going	too	fast	--	and	then	i	took	a	rapidograph	pen	--	explain	it	to	the	 young 	 sters 	 	--	and	i	just	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 constitute 	 	the	dinosaur	.
i	had	no	idea	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	i	had	no	idea	where	i	was	going	,	but	at	some	point	,	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	--	when	to	keep	going	would	seem	like	i	was	going	too	far	.
and	what	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	was	a	graphic	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	us	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	animal	coming	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	in	the	middle	of	the	process	.
and	then	i	just	threw	some	 typo 	 graphy 	 	on	it	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	stuff	,	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 suggest 	 ive 	 	of	public	park	 sign 	 age 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	in	house	 love 	 d 	 	it	,	and	so	off	it	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	author	.
and	even	back	then	,	michael	was	on	the	cutting	edge	.
``	michael	crichton	 respond 	 s 	 	by	fax	:	``	``	 w 	 ow 	 	!	 fuck 	 ing 	 	fantastic	jacket	``	that	was	a	relief	to	see	that	pour	out	of	the	machine	.
i	 mis 	 s 	 	michael	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 some 	 body 	 	from	mca	universal	 call 	 s 	 	our	legal	 depart 	 ment 	 	to	see	if	they	can	 may 	 be 	 	look	 in 	 to 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	the	 right 	 s 	 	to	the	image	,	just	in	case	they	might	want	to	use	it	.
well	,	they	used	it	.
and	i	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	.
we	all	know	it	was	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	movie	,	and	it	was	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	see	it	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	culture	and	 be 	 come 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	and	to	see	all	the	different	 per 	 mutation 	 s 	 	of	it	.
but	not	too	long	ago	,	i	came	 up 	 on 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	web	.
no	,	that	is	not	me	.
but	 who 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	i	ca	n't	help	but	 think 	 ing 	 	they	 wok 	 e 	 	up	one	day	like	,	``	oh	my	god	,	that	was	n't	there	last	night	.	ooooohh	!
i	was	so	 waste 	 d 	 	.	``
but	if	you	think	about	it	,	from	my	head	to	my	 hand 	 s 	 	to	his	leg	.
that	's	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	that	i	do	n't	take	 light 	 ly 	 	.
the	book	 design 	 er 	 	's	 respons 	 ibility 	 	is	threefold	:	to	the	 read 	 er 	 	,	to	the	 publish 	 er 	 	and	,	most	of	all	,	to	the	author	.
i	want	you	to	look	at	the	author	's	book	and	say	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	!	i	need	to	read	that	.	``
david	sedaris	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	,	and	the	title	essay	in	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	is	about	his	trip	to	a	nudist	 colon 	 y 	 	.
and	the	reason	he	went	is	 be 	 cause 	 	he	had	a	fear	of	his	body	image	,	and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	explore	what	was	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	that	.
for	me	,	it	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	an	excuse	to	design	a	book	that	you	could	 liter 	 ally 	 	take	the	pants	off	of	.
but	when	you	do	,	you	do	n't	get	what	you	expect	.
you	get	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	much	 deep 	 er 	 	than	that	.
and	david	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	design	 be 	 cause 	 	at	book	signings	,	which	he	 do 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	,	he	could	take	a	magic	marker	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
 hell 	 o 	 	!
augusten	burroughs	wrote	a	memoir	 call 	 ed 	 	[	``	dry	``	]	,	and	it	's	about	his	time	in	rehab	.
in	his	20s	,	he	was	a	 hot 	 shot 	 	ad	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	mad	men	 ha 	 s 	 	told	us	,	a	 rag 	 ing 	 	 alcohol 	 ic 	 	.
he	did	not	think	so	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	but	his	 co 	 work 	 ers 	 	did	an	intervention	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	are	going	to	rehab	,	or	you	will	be	 fire 	 d 	 	and	you	will	die	.	``
now	to	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	be	a	typographic	solution	,	what	i	would	call	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	type	101	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
 usual 	 ly 	 	on	the	first	day	of	 introduc 	 tion 	 	to	 typo 	 graphy 	 	,	you	get	the	 assign 	 ment 	 	of	,	select	a	word	and	make	it	look	like	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	it	is	.	so	that	's	type	101	,	right	?
 ver 	 y 	 	simple	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	that	.
i	want	 th 	 is 	 	book	to	look	like	it	's	 ly 	 ing 	 	to	you	,	 desperate 	 ly 	 	and	 hope 	 lessly 	 	,	the	way	an	 alcohol 	 ic 	 	would	.
the	answer	was	the	most	low	-	tech	thing	you	can	imagine	.
i	set	up	the	type	,	i	 print 	 ed 	 	it	out	on	an	epson	 print 	 er 	 	with	water	-	soluble	ink	,	taped	it	to	the	wall	and	threw	a	 buck 	 et 	 	of	water	at	it	.	presto	!
then	when	we	went	to	press	,	the	 print 	 er 	 	put	a	spot	gloss	on	the	ink	and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	it	was	running	.
not	long	after	it	came	out	,	augusten	was	waylaid	in	an	 air 	 port 	 	and	he	was	 hid 	 ing 	 	out	in	the	 book 	 store 	 	 s 	 py 	 ing 	 	on	who	was	 buy 	 ing 	 	his	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	woman	came	up	to	it	,	and	she	squinted	,	and	she	took	it	to	the	register	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	man	 be 	 hind 	 	the	counter	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 ruin 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	the	guy	 be 	 hind 	 	the	counter	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	know	,	 lad 	 y 	 	.	they	all	came	in	that	way	.	``
now	,	that	's	a	good	 print 	 ing 	 	job	.
a	book	cover	is	a	 distill 	 ation 	 	.
it	is	a	haiku	,	if	you	will	,	of	the	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	story	by	osama	tezuka	is	his	epic	life	of	the	buddha	,	and	it	's	eight	 volume 	 s 	 	in	all	.	but	the	best	thing	is	when	it	's	on	your	shelf	,	you	get	a	shelf	life	of	the	buddha	,	moving	from	one	age	to	the	next	.
all	of	these	 solution 	 s 	 	 der 	 ive 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 origin 	 s 	 	from	the	text	of	the	book	,	but	once	the	book	 design 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	read	the	text	,	then	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	an	interpreter	and	a	 transl 	 ator 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	story	was	a	real	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	's	about	.
``	 intrigu 	 e 	 	and	murder	among	16th	century	ottoman	court	 paint 	 ers 	 	.	``
all	right	,	so	i	got	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	the	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	together	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	them	and	i	 de 	 construct 	 ed 	 	them	and	i	put	them	back	together	.
and	so	,	here	's	the	design	,	right	?
and	so	here	's	the	front	and	the	 s 	 pine 	 	,	and	it	's	flat	.
but	the	real	story	 start 	 s 	 	when	you	wrap	it	around	a	book	and	put	it	on	the	shelf	.
ahh	!	we	come	 up 	 on 	 	them	,	the	clandestine	 lover 	 s 	 	.	let	's	draw	them	out	.
huhh	!	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	the	sultan	.
he	will	not	be	 pleas 	 ed 	 	.
huhh	!	and	now	the	sultan	is	in	danger	.
and	now	,	we	have	to	open	it	up	to	find	out	what	's	going	to	happen	next	.
try	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	that	on	a	kindle	.
do	n't	get	me	 start 	 ed 	 	.
 serious 	 ly 	 	.
much	is	to	be	 gain 	 ed 	 	by	ebooks	:	ease	,	convenience	,	portability	.
but	 some 	 thing 	 	is	 definite 	 ly 	 	lost	:	tradition	,	a	sensual	experience	,	the	comfort	of	 thing 	 y 	 	-	ness	--	a	little	bit	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
do	you	know	what	john	updike	used	to	do	the	first	thing	when	he	would	get	a	copy	of	one	of	his	new	 book 	 s 	 	from	alfred	a.	knopf	?
he	'd	smell	it	.
then	he	'd	run	his	hand	over	the	rag	paper	,	and	the	 pun 	 gent 	 	ink	and	the	deckled	 edge 	 s 	 	of	the	 page 	 s 	 	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	he	never	got	 tire 	 d 	 	of	it	.
now	,	i	am	all	for	the	ipad	,	but	trust	me	--	 smell 	 ing 	 	it	will	get	you	 no 	 where 	 	.
now	the	apple	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 text 	 ing 	 	,	``	develop	odor	 e 	 mission 	 	plug	-	in	.	``
and	the	last	story	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	 quit 	 e 	 	a	story	.
a	woman	named	aomame	in	1984	japan	 find 	 s 	 	 her 	 self 	 	 negoti 	 ating 	 	down	a	spiral	 stair 	 case 	 	off	an	 elev 	 ated 	 	 high 	 way 	 	.	when	she	 get 	 s 	 	to	the	bottom	,	she	ca	n't	help	but	feel	that	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	she	's	 enter 	 ed 	 	a	new	 re 	 ality 	 	that	's	just	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	from	the	one	that	she	left	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	,	but	different	.
and	so	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	parallel	 plane 	 s 	 	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	sort	of	like	a	book	jacket	and	the	book	that	it	 cover 	 s 	 	.
so	how	do	we	show	 th 	 is 	 	?
we	go	back	to	hepburn	and	dietrich	,	but	now	we	merge	them	.
so	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	different	 plane 	 s 	 	,	different	 piece 	 s 	 	of	paper	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	on	a	semi	-	 trans 	 parent 	 	piece	of	velum	.
it	's	one	part	of	the	form	and	content	.
when	it	's	on	top	of	the	paper	board	,	which	is	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	it	 form 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	even	if	you	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	you	are	 force 	 d 	 	to	consider	a	single	person	 straddl 	 ing 	 	two	 plane 	 s 	 	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
and	the	object	 it 	 self 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	exploration	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	 consider 	 ation 	 	and	touch	.
 th 	 is 	 	 debut 	 ed 	 	at	number	two	on	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	best	seller	list	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 un 	 heard 	 	of	,	both	for	us	the	 publish 	 er 	 	,	and	the	author	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	a	900	-	page	book	that	is	 a 	 s 	 	weird	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	 compel 	 ling 	 	,	and	 feat 	 ur 	 ing 	 	a	climactic	scene	in	which	a	horde	of	 tin 	 y 	 	people	emerge	from	the	mouth	of	a	 sleep 	 ing 	 	girl	and	cause	a	german	shepherd	to	explode	.
not	 exact 	 ly 	 	jackie	collins	.
 four 	 teen 	 	 week 	 s 	 	on	the	best	seller	list	,	eight	printings	,	and	still	going	strong	.
so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	love	 publish 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	art	,	we	 ver 	 y 	 	much	know	it	's	a	business	too	,	and	that	if	we	do	our	 job 	 s 	 	right	and	get	a	little	 luck 	 y 	 	,	that	great	art	can	be	great	business	.
so	that	's	my	story	.	to	be	 continu 	 ed 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	look	like	?
 y 	 es 	 	.	it	can	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	and	it	will	,	but	for	 th 	 is 	 	book	 design 	 er 	 	,	page	-	turner	,	dog	-	eared	place	-	holder	,	 note 	 s 	 	in	the	 margin 	 s 	 	-	taker	,	ink	-	 sniff 	 er 	 	,	the	story	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
thank	you	.
