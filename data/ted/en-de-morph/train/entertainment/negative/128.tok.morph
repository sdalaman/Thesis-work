i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	.	i	do	n't	think	we	're	going	to	make	it	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	by	now	most	of	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	al	gore	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	talk	.
 short 	 ly 	 	after	i	saw	that	,	we	had	some	 friend 	 s 	 	over	for	 d 	 inner 	 	with	the	family	.	the	conversation	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	,	there	's	a	real	problem	.
we	've	got	a	climate	crisis	.
so	,	we	went	around	the	table	to	talk	about	what	we	should	do	.
the	conversation	came	to	my	15	-	year	-	old	daughter	,	mary	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	agree	with	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	.
i	'm	 scar 	 ed 	 	and	i	'm	 ang 	 ry 	 	.	``	and	then	she	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	dad	,	your	generation	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	problem	;	you	'd	better	fix	it	.	``	 w 	 ow 	 	.
all	the	conversation	 stop 	 ped 	 	.	all	the	 eye 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
i	did	n't	know	what	to	say	.	kleiner	's	second	law	is	,	``	there	is	a	time	when	panic	is	the	appropriate	 respons 	 e 	 	.	``
and	we	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	that	time	.	we	can	not	afford	to	 under 	 estimate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.	if	we	face	 ir 	 revers 	 ible 	 	and	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	,	we	must	act	,	and	we	must	act	 decis 	 ively 	 	.
i	've	got	to	tell	you	,	for	me	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 change 	 d 	 	that	 even 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	,	my	 partner 	 s 	 	and	i	,	we	set	off	on	 th 	 is 	 	mission	to	learn	more	,	to	try	to	do	much	more	.	so	,	we	 mobilize 	 d 	 	.	we	got	on	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
we	went	to	brazil	.	we	went	to	 chin 	 a 	 	and	to	india	,	to	bentonville	,	arkansas	,	to	washington	,	d.c.	and	to	sacramento	.
and	so	,	what	i	'd	like	to	do	now	is	to	tell	you	about	what	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 journey 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	more	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	the	more	 concern 	 ed 	 	we	grew	.
you	know	,	my	 partner 	 s 	 	at	kleiner	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	compulsive	 network 	 ers 	 	,	and	so	when	we	see	a	big	problem	or	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	like	 av 	 ian 	 	flu	or	 personal 	 ized 	 	medicine	,	we	just	get	together	the	 smart 	 est 	 	people	we	know	.
for	 th 	 is 	 	climate	crisis	,	we	 assemble 	 d 	 	a	network	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	of	 super 	 star 	 s 	 	,	from	policy	 activist 	 s 	 	to	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	and	business	 lead 	 ers 	 	.	fifty	or	so	of	them	.
and	so	,	i	want	to	tell	you	about	what	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	that	and	four	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	year	.
the	first	 less 	 on 	 	is	that	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	and	that	 matter 	 s 	 	a	lot	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	story	about	how	wal	-	mart	went	green	,	and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	ceo	,	lee	scott	,	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	green	is	the	next	big	thing	,	and	so	wal	-	mart	made	going	green	a	top	 prior 	 ity 	 	.
they	 commit 	 ted 	 	that	they	're	going	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 exist 	 ing 	 	 store 	 s 	 	and	 reduc 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	consumption	by	20	percent	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	new	 store 	 s 	 	by	30	percent	,	and	do	all	that	in	seven	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	three	 big 	 gest 	 	uses	of	energy	in	a	store	are	 heat 	 ing 	 	and	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	,	then	 light 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	 refrige 	 ration 	 	.
so	,	look	what	they	did	.
they	 paint 	 ed 	 	the	 roof 	 s 	 	of	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 store 	 s 	 	white	.
they	put	smart	 sky 	 light 	 s 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 store 	 s 	 	so	they	could	harvest	the	 day 	 light 	 	and	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 light 	 ing 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	.
and	,	third	,	they	put	the	 refrige 	 rated 	 	 good 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	closed	 door 	 s 	 	with	led	 light 	 ing 	 	.
i	mean	,	why	would	you	try	to	 refrige 	 rate 	 	a	whole	store	?
these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	,	smart	 solution 	 s 	 	based	on	 exist 	 ing 	 	technology	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	wal	-	mart	matter	?	well	,	it	's	massive	.
they	're	the	largest	private	 employ 	 er 	 	in	america	.
they	're	the	largest	private	user	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
they	have	the	second	-	largest	vehicle	fleet	on	the	road	.
and	they	have	one	of	the	world	's	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	supply	 chain 	 s 	 	,	60,000	 suppli 	 ers 	 	.	if	wal	-	mart	 we 	 re 	 	a	country	,	it	would	be	the	sixth	-	largest	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	partner	with	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	they	have	a	big	effect	on	other	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
when	wal	-	mart	 declare 	 s 	 	it	's	going	to	go	green	and	be	 profit 	 able 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	impact	on	other	great	 institution 	 s 	 	.
so	,	let	me	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	:	when	wal	-	mart	 achiev 	 es 	 	20	percent	energy	 reduc 	 tions 	 	,	that	's	going	to	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	deal	.	but	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
we	need	wal	-	mart	and	every	other	company	to	do	the	same	.
the	second	thing	that	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	 individual 	 s 	 	matter	,	and	they	matter	 enormous 	 ly 	 	.
i	've	got	 an 	 other 	 	wal	-	mart	story	for	you	,	ok	?
wal	-	mart	 ha 	 s 	 	over	125	million	u.s.	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
that	's	a	third	of	the	u.s.	population	.
65	million	compact	fluorescent	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 old 	 	last	year	.
and	wal	-	mart	 ha 	 s 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	they	're	going	to	sell	 an 	 other 	 	100	million	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	in	the	coming	year	.	but	it	's	not	easy	.
 consumer 	 s 	 	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	like	these	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
the	light	's	kind	of	funny	,	they	wo	n't	 d 	 im 	 	,	 take 	 s 	 	a	while	for	them	to	start	up	.
but	the	pay	-	off	is	 re 	 ally 	 	enormous	.
100	million	compact	fluorescent	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	'll	 s 	 ave 	 	600	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	energy	 bill 	 s 	 	,	and	20	million	 ton 	 s 	 	of	co	2	every	year	,	year	in	and	year	out	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	seem	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	get	 consumer 	 s 	 	to	do	the	right	thing	.
it	is	stupid	that	we	use	two	 ton 	 s 	 	of	steel	,	glass	and	plastic	to	haul	our	sorry	 s 	 elves 	 	to	the	 shop 	 ping 	 	mall	.
it	's	stupid	that	we	put	water	in	plastic	 bottle 	 s 	 	in	fiji	and	ship	it	here	.
it	's	hard	to	change	consumer	behavior	 be 	 cause 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	do	n't	know	how	much	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 cost 	 s 	 	.	do	you	know	?
do	you	know	how	much	co	2	you	generated	to	drive	here	or	fly	here	?
i	do	n't	know	,	and	i	should	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	care	about	all	 th 	 is 	 	would	act	better	if	we	 k 	 new 	 	what	the	real	 cost 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	pretend	that	co	2	is	free	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	these	uses	are	 near 	 ly 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	,	how	can	we	expect	change	?
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 change 	 s 	 	we	can	 reason 	 ably 	 	expect	from	 individual 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	 clear 	 ly 	 	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
the	third	 less 	 on 	 	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	policy	 matter 	 s 	 	.	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	policy	is	 para 	 mount 	 	.
i	've	got	a	 be 	 hind 	 	-	the	-	 scene 	 s 	 	story	for	you	about	that	green	tech	network	i	 de 	 scribed 	 	.
at	the	end	of	our	first	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	we	got	together	to	talk	about	what	the	action	 item 	 s 	 	would	be	,	how	we	'd	follow	up	.
and	bob	epstein	raised	a	hand	.	he	stood	up	.
you	know	,	bob	's	that	berkeley	 tech 	 ie 	 	type	who	 start 	 ed 	 	sybase	.
well	,	bob	 s 	 aid 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	we	could	do	right	now	is	to	make	it	clear	in	sacramento	,	california	that	we	need	a	market	-	based	system	of	 man 	 date 	 s 	 	that	's	going	to	cap	and	 reduc 	 e 	 	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	in	california	.
it	's	 necess 	 ary 	 	and	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	it	's	good	for	the	california	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
so	,	eight	of	us	went	to	sacramento	in	august	and	we	met	with	the	seven	 un 	 decide 	 d 	 	 legisl 	 ators 	 	and	we	 lobbi 	 ed 	 	for	ab	32	.
you	know	what	?	six	of	 t 	 hose 	 	seven	 vot 	 ed 	 	 y 	 es 	 	in	favor	of	the	bill	,	so	it	 pass 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	 pass 	 ed 	 	by	a	vote	of	47	to	32	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	.	thank	you	.
i	think	it	's	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 legisl 	 ation 	 	of	2006	.	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	california	was	the	first	state	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	to	 man 	 date 	 	25	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	of	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	by	2020	.
and	the	result	of	that	is	,	we	're	going	to	generate	83,000	new	 job 	 s 	 	,	four	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	in	annual	income	,	and	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	by	174	million	 ton 	 s 	 	a	year	.
california	 emit 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	seven	percent	of	u.s.	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	percent	and	a	half	of	the	country	's	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.	it	's	a	great	start	,	but	i	've	got	to	tell	you	--	where	i	 start 	 ed 	 	--	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	'm	certain	california	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
here	's	a	story	about	national	policy	that	we	could	all	learn	from	.
you	know	tom	friedman	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	if	you	do	n't	go	,	you	do	n't	know	``	?
well	,	we	went	to	brazil	to	meet	dr.	jose	goldemberg	.
he	's	the	father	of	the	ethanol	revolution	.
he	told	us	that	brazil	's	government	 man 	 d 	 ated 	 	that	every	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	station	in	the	country	would	carry	ethanol	.
and	they	 man 	 d 	 ated 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	new	 vehicle 	 s 	 	would	be	flex	-	fuel	compatible	,	right	?
they	'd	run	ethanol	or	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	.
and	so	,	here	's	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	brazil	.
they	now	have	29,000	ethanol	 pump 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	700	in	the	u.s.	,	and	a	 pal 	 try 	 	two	in	california	--	and	in	three	 year 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	new	car	fleet	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	from	four	percent	to	85	percent	flex	-	fuel	.
 compar 	 e 	 	that	to	the	u.s.	:	five	percent	are	flex	-	fuel	.
and	you	know	what	?	most	 consumer 	 s 	 	who	have	them	do	n't	even	know	it	.
so	,	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	brazil	is	,	they	've	 replace 	 d 	 	40	percent	of	the	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 auto 	 motive 	 	fleet	with	ethanol	.
that	's	59	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	since	1975	that	they	did	n't	ship	to	the	middle	east	.
it	's	 create 	 d 	 	a	million	 job 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	that	country	,	and	it	's	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	32	million	 ton 	 s 	 	of	co	2.	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 sub 	 stantial 	 	.
that	's	10	percent	of	the	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	country	.
but	brazil	's	 on 	 ly 	 	1.3	percent	of	the	world	's	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 	.
so	,	brazil	's	ethanol	miracle	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	,	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	all	of	the	best	 poli 	 cies 	 	we	have	are	not	going	to	be	 en 	 ough 	 	.
the	fourth	and	final	 less 	 on 	 	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	about	the	potential	of	radical	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
so	,	i	want	to	tell	you	about	a	tragic	problem	and	a	 break 	 through 	 	technology	.
every	year	a	million	and	a	half	people	die	of	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 prevent 	 able 	 	disease	.	that	's	malaria	.	6,000	people	a	day	.
all	for	want	of	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	 medic 	 ations 	 	that	we	can	buy	at	the	corner	 drug 	 store 	 	.
well	,	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	is	too	much	for	africa	.
so	,	a	team	of	berkeley	 research 	 ers 	 	with	15	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	from	the	 gate 	 s 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	is	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	 design 	 ing 	 	a	radical	new	way	to	make	the	key	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	artemisinin	,	and	they	're	going	to	make	that	drug	10	 time 	 s 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
and	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	they	'll	 s 	 ave 	 	a	million	 live 	 s 	 	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	million	 live 	 s 	 	a	year	.	a	million	 live 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 break 	 through 	 	technology	is	synthetic	biology	.
 th 	 is 	 	 leverage 	 s 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	evolution	by	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	 bug 	 s 	 	to	make	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
now	,	what	you	do	is	,	you	get	 in 	 side 	 	the	 micro 	 be 	 	,	you	change	 it 	 s 	 	 metabol 	 ic 	 	 path 	 ways 	 	,	and	you	end	up	with	a	living	chemical	 factor 	 y 	 	.
now	,	you	may	ask	,	john	,	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	got	to	go	with	green	and	with	climate	crisis	?
well	,	i	'll	tell	you	--	a	lot	.
we	've	now	 form 	 ed 	 	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	amyris	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	technology	that	they	're	using	can	be	used	to	make	better	 bio 	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
do	n't	let	me	skip	over	that	.	better	 bio 	 fuel 	 s 	 	are	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	deal	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	can	 precise 	 ly 	 	engineer	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	the	fuel	chain	and	optimize	them	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
so	,	if	all	 go 	 es 	 	well	,	they	're	going	to	have	 design 	 er 	 	 bug 	 s 	 	in	warm	 va 	 ts 	 	that	are	eating	and	 digest 	 ing 	 	 sugar 	 s 	 	to	excrete	better	 bio 	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
i	guess	that	's	better	living	through	 bug 	 s 	 	.
alan	kay	is	famous	for	 say 	 ing 	 	the	best	way	to	predict	the	future	is	to	invent	it	.
and	,	of	course	,	at	kleiner	we	,	kind	of	,	 apolog 	 ize 	 	and	say	the	second	best	way	is	to	finance	it	.
and	that	's	why	we	're	 invest 	 ing 	 	200	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	a	wide	range	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	green	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
and	we	're	 encourag 	 ing 	 	 other 	 s 	 	to	do	it	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	a	lot	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	2005	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	600	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	of	the	sort	you	see	here	.	it	 double 	 d 	 	in	2006	to	1.2	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	we	need	much	,	much	more	.
for	 re 	 ference 	 	,	fact	one	:	exxon	's	 revenue 	 s 	 	in	2005	 we 	 re 	 	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
do	you	know	,	they	 on 	 ly 	 	 invest 	 ed 	 	0.2	percent	of	 revenue 	 s 	 	in	r	&	d	?
second	fact	:	the	 p 	 resident 	 	's	new	budget	for	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	is	 bare 	 ly 	 	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	total	.
less	than	one	day	of	exxon	's	 revenue 	 s 	 	.
third	fact	:	i	bet	you	did	n't	know	that	there	's	 en 	 ough 	 	energy	in	hot	 rock 	 s 	 	under	the	country	to	supply	america	's	energy	 need 	 s 	 	for	the	next	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	.	and	the	federal	budget	 call 	 s 	 	for	a	 mea 	 s 	 ly 	 	20	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	r	&	d	in	 geo 	 thermal 	 	energy	.
it	is	 al 	 most 	 	criminal	that	we	are	not	 invest 	 ing 	 	more	in	energy	research	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
and	i	am	 re 	 ally 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	that	it	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
so	,	in	a	year	's	worth	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	we	found	a	bunch	of	 surprise 	 s 	 	.
who	would	have	thought	that	a	mass	 re 	 tail 	 er 	 	could	make	money	by	going	green	?	who	would	have	thought	that	a	 data 	 base 	 	entrepreneur	could	transform	california	with	 legisl 	 ation 	 	?
who	would	have	thought	that	the	ethanol	 bio 	 fuel 	 	miracle	would	come	from	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	in	south	america	?
and	who	would	have	thought	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	cure	malaria	could	come	up	with	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	in	 bio 	 fuel 	 s 	 	?
and	who	would	have	thought	that	all	that	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	?
not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 stabil 	 ize 	 	the	climate	.
not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	keep	the	ice	in	greenland	from	 crash 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	.
the	 scientist 	 s 	 	tell	us	--	and	they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 guess 	 ing 	 	--	that	we	've	got	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	 green 	 house 	 	gas	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	by	one	half	,	and	do	it	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
now	,	we	may	have	the	 politic 	 al 	 	will	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	u.s.	,	but	i	've	got	to	tell	you	,	we	've	got	 on 	 ly 	 	one	atmosphere	,	and	so	 some 	 how 	 	we	're	going	to	have	to	find	the	 politic 	 al 	 	will	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	all	around	the	world	.	the	wild	card	in	 th 	 is 	 	deck	is	 chin 	 a 	 	.
to	 s 	 ize 	 	the	problem	,	 chin 	 a 	 	's	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	3.3	 giga 	 ton 	 s 	 	;	the	u.s.	is	5.8	.	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	 mean 	 s 	 	we	'll	have	23	 giga 	 ton 	 s 	 	from	 chin 	 a 	 	by	2050	.
that	's	about	 a 	 s 	 	much	co	2	 a 	 s 	 	there	is	in	the	whole	world	.
and	if	it	's	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	,	we	're	going	out	of	business	.
when	i	was	in	davos	,	 chin 	 a 	 	's	mayor	of	dalian	was	 press 	 ed 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	co	2	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	,	``	you	know	,	americans	use	seven	 time 	 s 	 	the	co	2	per	capita	 a 	 s 	 	chinese	.	``
then	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	why	should	 chin 	 a 	 	sacrifice	our	growth	so	that	the	west	can	 continu 	 e 	 	to	be	 pro 	 fli 	 gate 	 	and	stupid	?	``
 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	here	have	an	answer	for	him	?	i	do	n't	.
we	've	got	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	economic	so	that	all	people	and	all	 nation 	 s 	 	make	the	right	 out 	 come 	 	,	the	 profit 	 able 	 	 out 	 come 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	the	 like 	 ly 	 	 out 	 come 	 	.
energy	's	a	six	-	trillion	-	dollar	business	 world 	 wide 	 	.
it	is	the	mother	of	all	 market 	 s 	 	.	you	remember	that	 inter 	 net 	 	?
well	,	i	'll	tell	you	what	.	green	 techno 	 logies 	 	--	going	green	--	is	 big 	 ger 	 	than	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
it	could	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	economic	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	of	the	21st	century	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	if	we	succeed	,	it	's	going	to	be	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	for	life	on	the	planet	since	,	 a 	 s 	 	bill	joy	 say 	 s 	 	,	we	went	from	 m 	 ethane 	 	to	oxygen	in	the	atmosphere	.
now	,	here	's	the	hard	question	,	if	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	of	all	the	world	's	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 individual 	 s 	 	and	 poli 	 cies 	 	and	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	not	going	to	be	 en 	 ough 	 	,	what	are	we	going	to	do	?	i	do	n't	know	.
 every 	 one 	 	here	 care 	 s 	 	about	changing	the	world	and	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	that	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	,	our	call	to	action	--	my	call	to	you	--	is	for	you	to	make	going	green	your	next	big	thing	,	your	gig	.
what	can	you	do	?	you	can	 personal 	 ly 	 	get	carbon	neutral	.
go	to	climatecrisis.org	or	carboncalculator.com	and	buy	carbon	 credit 	 s 	 	.	you	could	join	other	 lead 	 ers 	 	in	 man 	 d 	 ating 	 	,	 lobby 	 ing 	 	for	 man 	 d 	 ated 	 	cap	and	trade	in	u.s.	 green 	 house 	 	gas	 reduc 	 tions 	 	.
there	's	six	 bill 	 s 	 	right	now	in	congress	.	let	's	get	one	of	them	 pass 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	you	can	do	,	i	think	,	is	to	use	your	personal	power	and	your	rolodex	to	lead	your	business	,	your	institution	,	in	going	green	.
do	it	like	wal	-	mart	,	get	it	to	go	green	for	 it 	 s 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 suppli 	 ers 	 	and	for	 it 	 self 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	think	 out 	 side 	 	the	box	.
can	you	imagine	what	it	would	be	like	if	amazon	or	ebay	or	google	or	 micro 	 soft 	 	or	apple	 re 	 ally 	 	went	green	and	you	 caus 	 ed 	 	that	to	happen	?
it	could	be	 big 	 ger 	 	than	wal	-	mart	.
i	ca	n't	wait	to	see	what	we	tedsters	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	crisis	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	that	we	 multi 	 ply 	 	all	of	our	energy	,	all	of	our	talent	and	all	of	our	influence	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	do	,	i	can	look	forward	to	the	conversation	i	'm	going	to	have	with	my	daughter	in	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
