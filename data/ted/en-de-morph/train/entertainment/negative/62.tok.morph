what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
i	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	``	the	 skeptic 	 al 	 	 environment 	 alist 	 	``	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	good	choice	.
but	i	am	going	talk	about	:	what	are	the	big	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	world	?
and	i	must	say	,	before	i	go	on	,	i	should	ask	every	one	of	you	to	try	and	get	out	pen	and	paper	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	ask	you	to	help	me	to	look	at	how	we	do	that	.
so	get	out	your	pen	and	paper	.
bottom	line	is	,	there	is	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	out	there	in	the	world	.
i	'm	just	going	to	list	some	of	them	.
there	are	800	million	people	 starv 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	a	billion	people	 with 	 out 	 	clean	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
two	billion	people	 with 	 out 	 	 sanit 	 ation 	 	.
there	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	million	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	hiv	and	 aid 	 s 	 	.
the	 list 	 s 	 	go	on	and	on	.
there	's	two	 billion 	 s 	 	of	people	who	will	be	 severe 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	climate	change	--	so	on	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	out	there	.
in	an	ideal	world	,	we	would	solve	them	all	,	but	we	do	n't	.
we	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	solve	all	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	if	we	do	not	,	the	question	i	think	we	need	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	and	that	's	why	it	's	on	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	session	--	is	to	say	,	if	we	do	n't	do	all	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	start	 ask 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	which	 one 	 s 	 	should	we	solve	first	?
and	that	's	the	question	i	'd	like	to	ask	you	.
if	we	had	say	,	50	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	over	the	next	four	 year 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	to	do	good	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	where	should	we	 s 	 pend 	 	it	?
we	identified	10	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	in	the	world	,	and	i	will	just	 brief 	 ly 	 	read	them	:	climate	change	,	 commun 	 ic 	 able 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	education	,	financial	 in 	 st 	 ability 	 	,	 govern 	 ance 	 	and	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	and	 hung 	 er 	 	,	population	 migr 	 ation 	 	,	 sanit 	 ation 	 	and	water	,	and	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	and	trade	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	these	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	 en 	 compass 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
the	obvious	question	would	be	to	ask	,	what	do	you	think	are	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	?
where	should	we	start	on	solving	these	 problem 	 s 	 	?
but	that	's	a	wrong	problem	to	ask	.
that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	problem	that	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	in	davos	in	january	.
but	of	course	,	there	's	a	problem	in	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	to	focus	on	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	ca	n't	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	problem	we	have	in	the	world	is	that	we	all	die	.
but	we	do	n't	have	a	technology	to	solve	that	,	right	?
so	the	point	is	not	to	 priori 	 tize 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	but	the	point	is	to	 priori 	 tize 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	to	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	that	would	be	--	of	course	that	 get 	 s 	 	a	little	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
to	climate	change	that	would	be	like	kyoto	.
to	 commun 	 ic 	 able 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	it	might	be	health	 clinic 	 s 	 	or	mosquito	 net 	 s 	 	.
to	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	it	would	be	u.n.	's	 peace 	 keep 	 ing 	 	 force 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	.
the	point	that	i	would	like	to	ask	you	to	try	to	do	,	is	just	in	30	 second 	 s 	 	--	and	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	sense	an	 im 	 possible 	 	task	--	write	down	what	you	think	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	some	of	the	top	 prior 	 ities 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	--	and	that	's	,	of	course	,	where	 economic 	 s 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	--	to	put	down	what	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	should	not	do	,	first	.
what	should	be	at	the	bottom	of	the	list	?
 pleas 	 e 	 	,	just	take	30	 second 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	talk	to	your	neighbor	,	and	just	figure	out	what	should	be	the	top	 prior 	 ities 	 	and	the	bottom	 prior 	 ities 	 	of	the	 solution 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	the	world	's	 big 	 gest 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	process	--	and	of	course	,	i	mean	,	i	would	love	to	--	i	 on 	 ly 	 	have	18	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 give 	 n 	 	you	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 	amount	of	my	time	,	right	?
i	'd	love	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	,	and	get	you	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	we	did	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	,	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	we	'll	 al 	 so 	 	have	these	 discuss 	 ions 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	to	think	about	,	how	do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 priori 	 tize 	 	?
of	course	,	you	have	to	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	why	on	earth	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	list	never	 d 	 one 	 	before	?
and	one	reason	is	that	 priori 	 t 	 ization 	 	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
of	course	,	every	 organ 	 ization 	 	would	love	to	be	on	the	top	of	 s 	 uch 	 	a	list	.
but	every	 organ 	 ization 	 	would	 al 	 so 	 	hate	to	be	not	on	the	top	of	the	list	.
and	since	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	more	not	-	number	-	one	 spot 	 s 	 	on	the	list	than	there	is	number	 one 	 s 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	perfect	sense	not	to	want	to	do	 s 	 uch 	 	a	list	.
we	've	had	the	u.n.	for	 al 	 most 	 	60	 year 	 s 	 	,	yet	we	've	never	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	a	fundamental	list	of	all	the	big	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	in	the	world	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	which	of	them	should	we	do	first	?
so	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	we	are	not	 priori 	 tizing 	 	--	any	decision	is	a	 priori 	 t 	 ization 	 	,	so	of	course	we	are	still	 priori 	 tizing 	 	,	if	 on 	 ly 	 	 im 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	--	and	that	's	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	the	 priori 	 t 	 ization 	 	,	and	went	in	and	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	.
so	what	i	'm	 pro 	 posing 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	to	say	that	we	have	,	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	,	had	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	when	we	've	had	a	menu	of	 choice 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	do	out	there	,	but	we	've	not	had	the	 price 	 s 	 	,	nor	the	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	.
we	have	not	had	an	idea	.
imagine	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	restaurant	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	big	menu	card	,	but	you	have	no	idea	what	the	price	is	.
you	know	,	you	have	a	pizza	;	you	've	no	idea	what	the	price	is	.
it	could	be	at	one	dollar	;	it	could	be	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
it	could	be	a	family	-	 s 	 ize 	 	pizza	;	it	could	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	individual	-	 s 	 ize 	 	pizza	,	right	?
we	'd	like	to	know	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	what	the	copenhagen	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	--	to	try	to	put	 price 	 s 	 	on	these	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	copenhagen	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	'	process	.
we	got	30	of	the	world	's	best	 economist 	 s 	 	,	three	in	each	area	.
so	we	have	three	of	world	's	top	 economist 	 s 	 	write	about	climate	change	.
what	can	we	do	?	what	will	be	the	cost	and	what	will	be	the	benefit	of	that	?
 like 	 wise 	 	in	 commun 	 ic 	 able 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	.
three	of	the	world	's	top	 expert 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	what	can	we	do	?
what	would	be	the	price	?
what	should	we	do	about	it	,	and	what	will	be	the	 out 	 come 	 	?
and	so	on	.
then	we	had	some	of	the	world	's	top	 economist 	 s 	 	,	eight	of	the	world	's	top	 economist 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	three	 no 	 bel 	 	 laureate 	 s 	 	,	meet	in	copenhagen	in	may	2004	.
we	 call 	 ed 	 	them	the	``	dream	team	.	``
the	cambridge	university	 pre 	 fec 	 ts 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	call	them	the	real	madrid	of	 economic 	 s 	 	.
that	 work 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	in	europe	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	work	over	here	.
and	what	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	did	was	come	out	with	a	 priori 	 t 	 ized 	 	list	.
and	then	you	ask	,	why	 economist 	 s 	 	?
and	of	course	,	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	you	 ask 	 ed 	 	that	question	--	--	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	question	.
the	point	is	,	of	course	,	if	you	want	to	know	about	malaria	,	you	ask	a	malaria	expert	.
if	you	want	to	know	about	climate	,	you	ask	a	 climato 	 logist 	 	.
but	if	you	want	to	know	which	of	the	two	you	should	deal	with	first	,	you	ca	n't	ask	either	of	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	not	what	they	do	.
that	is	what	 economist 	 s 	 	do	.
they	 priori 	 tize 	 	.
they	make	that	in	some	ways	 disgust 	 ing 	 	task	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	which	one	should	we	do	first	,	and	which	one	should	we	do	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	list	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	one	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	.
of	course	,	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	it	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	we	'll	 al 	 so 	 	talk	about	it	more	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	day	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
they	 bas 	 ically 	 	came	up	with	a	list	where	they	 s 	 aid 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	bad	 project 	 s 	 	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 project 	 s 	 	where	if	you	invest	a	dollar	,	you	get	less	than	a	dollar	back	.
then	there	's	fair	 project 	 s 	 	,	good	 project 	 s 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 project 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	it	's	the	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 project 	 s 	 	we	should	start	 do 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	go	from	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	so	that	we	end	up	with	the	best	 project 	 s 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	the	bad	 project 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	might	see	the	bottom	of	the	list	was	climate	change	.
 th 	 is 	 	 offend 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	people	,	and	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	where	people	will	say	i	should	n't	come	back	,	either	.
and	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
why	is	it	it	came	up	?
and	i	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	try	to	get	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	'll	disagree	with	on	the	list	that	you	wrote	down	.
the	reason	why	they	came	up	with	 say 	 ing 	 	that	kyoto	--	or	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	more	than	kyoto	--	is	a	bad	deal	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 efficient 	 	.
it	's	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	is	not	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	not	a	big	problem	.
but	it	's	 say 	 ing 	 	that	what	we	can	do	about	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	little	,	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	cost	.
what	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	show	us	,	the	average	of	all	 macro 	 economic 	 	 model 	 s 	 	,	is	that	kyoto	,	if	 every 	 one 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	,	would	cost	about	150	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.
that	's	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 	amount	of	money	.
that	's	two	to	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	global	 develop 	 ment 	 	aid	that	we	give	the	third	world	every	year	.
yet	it	would	do	 ver 	 y 	 	little	good	.
all	 model 	 s 	 	show	it	will	postpone	 warm 	 ing 	 	for	about	six	 year 	 s 	 	in	2100	.
so	the	guy	in	bangladesh	who	 get 	 s 	 	a	flood	in	2100	can	wait	 un 	 til 	 	2106	.
which	is	a	little	good	,	but	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	good	.
so	the	idea	here	 re 	 ally 	 	is	to	say	,	well	,	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	money	 do 	 ing 	 	a	little	good	.
and	just	to	give	you	a	sense	of	 re 	 ference 	 	,	the	u.n.	 actual 	 ly 	 	estimate	that	for	half	that	amount	,	for	about	75	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	,	we	could	solve	all	major	 bas 	 ic 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
we	could	give	clean	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	,	 sanit 	 ation 	 	,	 bas 	 ic 	 	 health 	 care 	 	and	education	to	every	single	human	 be 	 ing 	 	on	the	planet	.
so	we	have	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	do	we	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	twice	the	amount	on	 do 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	good	?
or	half	the	amount	on	 do 	 ing 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	amount	of	good	?
and	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	why	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	bad	project	.
it	's	not	to	say	that	if	we	had	all	the	money	in	the	world	,	we	would	n't	want	to	do	it	.
but	it	's	to	say	,	when	we	do	n't	,	it	's	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	our	first	 prior 	 ity 	 	.
the	fair	 project 	 s 	 	--	notice	i	'm	not	going	to	comment	on	all	these	--	but	 commun 	 ic 	 able 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	scale	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	health	 service 	 s 	 	--	just	made	it	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	scale	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	health	 service 	 s 	 	is	a	great	thing	.
it	would	do	a	lot	of	good	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 cost 	 ly 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	is	 sudden 	 ly 	 	we	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	both	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	good	 project 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	 sanit 	 ation 	 	and	water	 project 	 s 	 	came	in	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 sanit 	 ation 	 	and	water	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
so	i	'd	like	to	show	you	the	top	four	 prior 	 ities 	 	which	should	be	at	 l 	 east 	 	the	first	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	deal	with	when	we	talk	about	how	we	should	deal	with	the	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
the	fourth	best	problem	is	malaria	--	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	malaria	.
the	incidence	of	malaria	is	about	a	couple	of	[	million	]	people	get	 infect 	 ed 	 	every	year	.
it	might	even	cost	up	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	 percent 	 age 	 	point	of	gdp	every	year	for	 affect 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
if	we	 invest 	 ed 	 	about	13	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	over	the	next	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	could	 br 	 ing 	 	that	incidence	down	to	half	.
we	could	avoid	about	500,000	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	we	could	avoid	about	a	[	million	]	people	 get 	 ting 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	every	year	.
we	would	 significant 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	deal	with	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	other	 problem 	 s 	 	that	they	have	to	deal	with	--	of	course	,	in	the	long	run	,	 al 	 so 	 	to	deal	with	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	third	best	one	was	free	trade	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	model	 show 	 ed 	 	that	if	we	could	get	free	trade	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	cut	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	in	the	u.s.	and	europe	,	we	could	 bas 	 ically 	 	enliven	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	an	 astound 	 ing 	 	number	of	about	2,400	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	,	half	of	which	would	accrue	to	the	third	world	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	point	is	to	say	that	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	pull	two	to	three	hundred	million	people	out	of	poverty	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 radical 	 ly 	 	fast	,	in	about	two	to	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	would	be	the	third	best	thing	we	could	do	.
the	second	best	thing	would	be	to	focus	on	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	.
not	just	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	in	general	,	but	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	way	of	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	,	 name 	 ly 	 	,	the	lack	of	 micro 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	about	half	of	the	world	's	population	is	 lack 	 ing 	 	in	iron	,	 z 	 inc 	 	,	 io 	 dine 	 	and	 vita 	 min 	 	a	.
if	we	invest	about	12	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	we	could	make	a	severe	 in 	 road 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	problem	.
that	would	be	the	second	best	 invest 	 ment 	 	that	we	could	do	.
and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	project	would	be	to	focus	on	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	if	we	invest	27	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	over	the	next	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	could	avoid	28	new	million	 case 	 s 	 	of	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	and	what	it	 focus 	 es 	 	on	is	 say 	 ing 	 	there	are	two	 ver 	 y 	 	different	ways	that	we	can	deal	with	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.
one	is	 treat 	 ment 	 	;	the	other	one	is	 prevent 	 ion 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	an	ideal	world	,	we	would	do	both	.
but	in	a	world	where	we	do	n't	do	either	,	or	do	n't	do	it	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	we	have	to	at	 l 	 east 	 	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	where	should	we	invest	first	.
and	 treat 	 ment 	 	is	much	,	much	more	expensive	than	 prevent 	 ion 	 	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	 focus 	 es 	 	on	is	 say 	 ing 	 	,	we	can	do	a	lot	more	by	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	 prevent 	 ion 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	for	the	amount	of	money	that	we	 s 	 pend 	 	,	we	can	do	x	amount	of	good	in	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	and	10	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	good	in	 prevent 	 ion 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	we	focus	on	is	 prevent 	 ion 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	at	first	rate	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	is	that	it	 make 	 s 	 	us	think	about	our	 prior 	 ities 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	have	you	look	at	your	 prior 	 ity 	 	list	and	say	,	did	you	get	it	right	?
or	did	you	get	close	to	what	we	came	up	with	here	?
well	,	of	course	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	is	climate	change	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	find	a	lot	of	people	find	it	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	that	we	should	do	that	.
we	should	 al 	 so 	 	do	climate	change	,	if	for	no	other	reason	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	problem	.
but	of	course	,	we	do	n't	do	all	 problem 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	out	there	in	the	world	.
and	what	i	want	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	of	is	,	if	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	focus	on	 problem 	 s 	 	,	that	we	focus	on	the	right	 one 	 s 	 	.
the	 one 	 s 	 	where	we	can	do	a	lot	of	good	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	little	good	.
and	i	think	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	thomas	schelling	,	one	of	the	 particip 	 ants 	 	in	the	dream	team	,	he	put	it	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
one	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	forget	,	is	that	in	100	 year 	 s 	 	,	when	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	most	of	the	climate	change	 impact 	 s 	 	will	be	,	people	will	be	much	,	much	 rich 	 er 	 	.
even	the	most	 pessim 	 istic 	 	impact	 scenario 	 s 	 	of	the	u.n	.
estimate	that	the	average	person	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	in	2100	will	be	about	 a 	 s 	 	rich	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
much	more	 like 	 ly 	 	,	they	will	be	two	to	four	 time 	 s 	 	 rich 	 er 	 	than	we	are	.
and	of	course	,	we	'll	be	even	 rich 	 er 	 	than	that	.
but	the	point	is	to	say	,	when	we	talk	about	saving	people	,	or	 help 	 ing 	 	people	in	bangladesh	in	2100	,	we	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	poor	bangladeshi	.
we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	rich	dutch	guy	.
and	so	the	real	point	,	of	course	,	is	to	say	,	do	we	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	money	 help 	 ing 	 	a	little	,	100	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	rich	dutch	guy	?
or	do	we	want	to	help	real	poor	people	,	right	now	,	in	bangladesh	,	who	 re 	 ally 	 	need	the	help	,	and	whom	we	can	help	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 cheap 	 ly 	 	?
or	 a 	 s 	 	schelling	put	it	,	imagine	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	rich	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	will	be	--	a	rich	chinese	,	a	rich	bolivian	,	a	rich	congolese	,	in	2100	,	 think 	 ing 	 	back	on	2005	,	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	how	odd	that	they	 car 	 ed 	 	so	much	about	 help 	 ing 	 	me	a	little	bit	through	climate	change	,	and	 car 	 ed 	 	so	 fair 	 ly 	 	little	about	 help 	 ing 	 	my	 grand 	 father 	 	and	my	great	 grand 	 father 	 	,	whom	they	could	have	 help 	 ed 	 	so	much	more	,	and	who	 need 	 ed 	 	the	help	so	much	more	?	``
so	i	think	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	tell	us	why	it	is	we	need	to	get	our	 prior 	 ities 	 	straight	.
even	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	accord	to	the	typical	way	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
of	course	,	that	's	 main 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	climate	change	 ha 	 s 	 	good	 picture 	 s 	 	.
we	have	,	you	know	,	``	the	day	after	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	``	--	it	 look 	 s 	 	great	,	right	?
it	's	a	good	film	in	the	sense	that	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	want	to	see	it	,	right	,	but	do	n't	expect	emmerich	to	cast	brad	pitt	in	his	next	movie	 dig 	 ging 	 	 latrine 	 s 	 	in	tanzania	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
it	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	for	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	a	movie	.
so	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	i	think	of	the	copenhagen	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	and	the	whole	 discuss 	 ion 	 	of	 prior 	 ities 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	defense	for	 bor 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	 real 	 ize 	 	it	's	not	about	making	us	feel	good	.
it	's	not	about	making	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	the	most	media	attention	,	but	it	's	about	making	 place 	 s 	 	where	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	the	most	good	.
the	other	 object 	 ions 	 	,	i	think	,	that	are	 import 	 ant 	 	to	say	,	is	that	i	'm	 some 	 how 	 	--	or	we	are	 some 	 how 	 	--	 posit 	 ing 	 	a	false	choice	.
of	course	,	we	should	do	all	 thing 	 s 	 	,	in	an	ideal	world	--	i	would	 certain 	 ly 	 	agree	.
i	think	we	should	do	all	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	.
in	1970	,	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	 decide 	 d 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	did	,	right	now	,	than	in	1970	,	on	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
since	then	our	aid	 ha 	 s 	 	 halv 	 ed 	 	.
so	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	on	the	path	of	 sudden 	 ly 	 	solving	all	big	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	people	are	 al 	 so 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	but	what	about	the	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	?
you	know	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	100	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	why	do	n't	we	 s 	 pend 	 	that	on	 do 	 ing 	 	good	in	the	world	?
i	'm	all	for	that	.
if	any	one	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	can	talk	bush	 in 	 to 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	that	's	fine	.
but	the	point	,	of	course	,	is	still	to	say	,	if	you	get	 an 	 other 	 	100	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	we	still	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	that	in	the	best	possible	way	,	do	n't	we	?
so	the	real	issue	here	is	to	get	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	back	and	think	about	what	are	the	right	 prior 	 ities 	 	.
i	should	just	 ment 	 ion 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	the	right	list	that	we	got	out	?
you	know	,	when	you	ask	the	world	's	best	 economist 	 s 	 	,	you	 inevit 	 ably 	 	end	up	 ask 	 ing 	 	old	,	white	american	men	.
and	they	're	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	,	you	know	,	great	ways	of	looking	at	the	entire	world	.
so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	80	young	people	from	all	over	the	world	to	come	and	solve	the	same	problem	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	at	the	university	,	and	they	spoke	english	.
the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	,	first	,	from	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
they	had	all	the	same	material	but	they	could	go	 vast 	 ly 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	scope	of	 discuss 	 ion 	 	,	and	they	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	,	to	come	up	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 list 	 s 	 	.
and	the	surprising	thing	was	that	the	list	was	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	--	with	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	and	 disease 	 s 	 	at	the	top	and	climate	change	at	the	bottom	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 time 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 semi 	 nar 	 s 	 	and	university	 student 	 s 	 	,	and	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	all	come	out	with	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	same	list	.
and	that	 give 	 s 	 	me	great	hope	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	in	 say 	 ing 	 	that	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	is	a	path	 a 	 head 	 	to	get	us	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 prior 	 ities 	 	,	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	what	is	the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	in	the	world	?
of	course	,	in	an	ideal	world	,	 aga 	 in 	 	we	'd	love	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	.
but	if	we	do	n't	do	it	,	then	we	can	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	where	should	we	start	?
i	see	the	copenhagen	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	process	.
we	did	it	in	2004	,	and	we	hope	to	assemble	 man 	 y 	 	more	people	,	 get 	 ting 	 	much	better	information	for	2008	,	2012	.
map	out	the	right	path	for	the	world	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 politic 	 al 	 	 tri 	 age 	 	.
to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	let	's	do	not	the	 thing 	 s 	 	where	we	can	do	 ver 	 y 	 	little	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	cost	,	not	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	know	how	to	do	,	but	let	's	do	the	great	 thing 	 s 	 	where	we	can	do	an	enormous	amount	of	good	,	at	 ver 	 y 	 	low	cost	,	right	now	.	``
at	the	end	of	the	day	,	you	can	disagree	with	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	of	how	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 priori 	 tize 	 	these	,	but	we	have	to	be	honest	and	frank	about	 say 	 ing 	 	,	if	there	's	some	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	,	there	are	other	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	do	.
if	we	worry	too	much	about	some	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	end	by	not	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	i	hope	 th 	 is 	 	will	help	us	make	better	 prior 	 ities 	 	,	and	think	about	how	we	better	work	for	the	world	.
thank	you	.
