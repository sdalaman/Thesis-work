i	'm	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	to	be	here	.
i	'm	 honor 	 ed 	 	by	the	 invit 	 ation 	 	,	and	 thank 	 s 	 	.
i	would	love	to	talk	about	stuff	that	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	suspect	that	what	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	wo	n't	interest	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	.
first	off	,	my	badge	 say 	 s 	 	i	'm	an	astronomer	.
i	would	love	to	talk	about	my	 astro 	 nomy 	 	,	but	i	suspect	that	the	number	of	people	who	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 radi 	 ative 	 	transfer	in	non	-	gray	 atmosphere 	 s 	 	and	 polar 	 ization 	 	of	light	in	jupiter	's	upper	atmosphere	are	the	number	of	people	who	'd	fit	in	a	bus	shelter	.
so	i	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	that	.
it	would	be	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	 f 	 un 	 	to	talk	about	some	stuff	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	1986	and	1987	,	when	a	computer	 hack 	 er 	 	is	 break 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 system 	 s 	 	over	at	lawrence	berkeley	 lab 	 s 	 	.
and	i	caught	the	 guy 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	for	what	was	then	the	soviet	kgb	,	and	 steal 	 ing 	 	information	and	selling	it	.
and	i	'd	love	to	talk	about	that	--	and	it	'd	be	 f 	 un 	 	--	but	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	...
i	find	computer	security	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	to	be	kind	of	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 ted 	 ious 	 	.
i	'm	--	the	first	time	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	it	's	science	.
the	second	time	,	it	's	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
a	third	time	,	it	's	just	 be 	 ing 	 	a	technician	.
i	'm	a	scientist	.	once	i	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	i	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
so	,	i	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	that	.
nor	am	i	going	to	talk	about	what	i	think	are	obvious	 state 	 ments 	 	from	my	first	book	,	``	silicon	snake	oil	,	``	or	my	second	book	,	nor	am	i	going	to	talk	about	why	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	do	n't	belong	in	 school 	 s 	 	.
i	feel	that	there	's	a	massive	and	bizarre	idea	going	around	that	we	have	to	 br 	 ing 	 	more	 computer 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
my	idea	is	:	no	!	no	!
get	them	out	of	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	keep	them	out	of	 school 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'd	love	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	i	think	the	argument	is	so	obvious	to	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	hung	around	a	fourth	grade	 class 	 room 	 	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	much	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	but	i	guess	i	may	be	 ver 	 y 	 	wrong	about	that	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	that	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	.
so	do	n't	go	back	and	read	my	 dissert 	 ation 	 	.
it	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	lies	in	it	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	i	 out 	 lined 	 	my	talk	about	five	 minute 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	if	you	look	at	it	over	here	,	the	main	thing	i	wrote	on	my	thumb	was	the	future	.
i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	talk	about	the	future	,	 y 	 es 	 	?
oh	,	right	.	and	my	 feel 	 ing 	 	is	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	to	talk	about	the	future	is	bizarre	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	got	gray	hair	,	and	so	,	it	's	kind	of	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	for	me	to	talk	about	the	future	.
in	fact	,	i	think	that	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	know	what	the	future	's	going	to	be	,	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	know	about	the	future	,	do	n't	ask	a	 techno 	 logist 	 	,	a	scientist	,	a	physicist	.
no	!	do	n't	ask	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	writing	code	.
no	,	if	you	want	to	know	what	 socie 	 ty 	 	's	going	to	be	like	in	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	ask	a	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	teacher	.
they	know	.
in	fact	,	do	n't	ask	just	any	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	teacher	,	ask	an	 experience 	 d 	 	one	.
they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	know	what	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	going	to	be	like	in	 an 	 other 	 	generation	.
i	do	n't	.	nor	,	i	suspect	,	do	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	who	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	what	the	future	will	 br 	 ing 	 	.
 certain 	 ly 	 	,	all	of	us	can	imagine	these	cool	new	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	be	there	.
but	to	me	,	 thing 	 s 	 	are	n't	the	future	.
what	i	ask	 my 	 self 	 	is	,	what	's	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	going	to	be	like	,	when	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	 phenomen 	 ally 	 	good	at	text	 mess 	 aging 	 	and	 s 	 pend 	 	a	huge	amount	of	on	-	screen	time	,	but	have	never	gone	 bowl 	 ing 	 	together	?
change	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	change	that	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	not	one	that	is	in	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
but	that	's	not	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	.
i	'd	love	to	talk	about	it	,	it	'd	be	 f 	 un 	 	,	but	i	want	to	talk	about	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	now	.	what	am	i	 do 	 ing 	 	now	?
oh	--	the	other	thing	that	i	think	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	is	right	over	here	.	right	over	here	.
is	that	visible	?	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	is	one	-	sided	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	would	 d 	 early 	 	love	to	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	one	side	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	love	mobius	 loop 	 s 	 	.	i	not	 on 	 ly 	 	love	mobius	 loop 	 s 	 	,	but	i	'm	one	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	,	if	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	in	the	world	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	klein	 bottle 	 s 	 	.
right	away	,	i	hope	that	all	of	your	 eye 	 s 	 	 glaz 	 e 	 	over	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	klein	bottle	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	in	the	audience	who	know	,	you	roll	your	 eye 	 s 	 	and	say	,	 y 	 up 	 	,	i	know	all	about	it	.
it	's	one	sided	.	it	's	a	bottle	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 in 	 side 	 	is	 it 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	zero	volume	.	and	it	's	non	-	orientable	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
if	you	take	two	mobius	 loop 	 s 	 	and	sew	 the 	 ir 	 	common	edge	together	,	you	get	one	of	these	,	and	i	make	them	out	of	glass	.
and	i	'd	love	to	talk	to	you	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	i	do	n't	have	much	in	the	way	of	...	 thing 	 s 	 	to	say	 be 	 cause 	 	--	 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	``	d	``	in	ted	of	course	 stand 	 s 	 	for	design	.
just	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	i	made	--	you	know	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	making	small	,	medium	and	big	klein	 bottle 	 s 	 	for	the	trade	.
but	what	i	've	just	made	--	and	i	'm	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	,	first	time	in	public	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	klein	bottle	wine	bottle	,	which	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	in	four	 dimension 	 s 	 	it	should	n't	be	able	to	hold	any	fluid	at	all	,	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	so	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	three	spatial	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	three	spatial	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	it	can	hold	 fluid 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	 high 	 ly 	 	--	that	one	's	the	cool	one	.
that	was	a	month	of	my	life	.
but	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	would	love	to	talk	about	 top 	 ology 	 	with	you	,	i	'm	not	going	to	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	my	mom	,	who	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	last	summer	.
had	 collect 	 ed 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	will	do	.
could	 some 	 body 	 	put	 th 	 is 	 	guy	up	?
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	over	her	 al 	 bum 	 	and	she	had	 collect 	 ed 	 	a	picture	of	me	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	--	well	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	--	in	1969	,	in	front	of	a	bunch	of	 dial 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	oh	my	god	,	that	was	me	,	when	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	music	studio	!
 a 	 s 	 	a	technician	,	 repair 	 ing 	 	and	 maintain 	 ing 	 	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	music	studio	at	suny	buffalo	.	and	 w 	 ow 	 	!
way	back	machine	.	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	!
and	it	 s 	 ent 	 	me	back	.
soon	after	that	,	i	found	in	 an 	 other 	 	picture	that	she	had	,	a	picture	of	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	over	here	of	course	is	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	man	is	robert	moog	,	the	inventor	of	the	moog	 synthesize 	 r 	 	,	who	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	 th 	 is 	 	past	august	.
robert	moog	was	a	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	,	kind	person	,	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 compete 	 nt 	 	engineer	.
a	 music 	 ian 	 	who	took	time	from	his	life	to	teach	me	,	a	 s 	 op 	 homo 	 re 	 	,	a	 fresh 	 man 	 	at	suny	buffalo	.
he	'd	come	up	from	trumansburg	to	teach	me	not	just	about	the	moog	 synthesize 	 r 	 	,	but	we	'd	be	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	--	i	'm	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	physics	at	the	time	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	1969	,	70	,	71	.
we	're	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	physics	,	i	'm	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	physics	,	and	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	that	's	a	good	thing	to	do	.
do	n't	get	caught	up	in	 electron 	 ic 	 	music	if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	physics	.	``
 mentor 	 ing 	 	me	.	he	'd	come	up	and	 s 	 pend 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	and	 hour 	 s 	 	with	me	.
he	wrote	a	letter	of	 recommend 	 ation 	 	for	me	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	graduate	school	.
in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	my	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	picture	was	taken	at	a	friend	's	living	room	.
bob	moog	came	by	and	 haul 	 ed 	 	a	whole	pile	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	to	show	greg	flint	and	i	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	 s 	 at 	 	around	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	fourier	 transform 	 s 	 	,	bessel	 function 	 s 	 	,	 modul 	 ation 	 	transfer	 function 	 s 	 	,	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
bob	's	 pass 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	past	summer	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	loss	to	all	of	us	.
 any 	 one 	 	who	's	a	 music 	 ian 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	robert	moog	.
and	i	'll	just	say	what	i	'm	about	to	do	.	what	i	'm	about	to	do	--	i	hope	you	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	there	's	a	 distort 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ine 	 	wave	,	 al 	 most 	 	a	 tri 	 angular 	 	wave	 up 	 on 	 	 th 	 is 	 	hewlett	-	packard	 oscill 	 o 	 scope 	 	.
oh	,	cool	.	i	can	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	over	here	,	right	?
 kid 	 s 	 	.	 kid 	 s 	 	is	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	--	is	that	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
it	 say 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	over	here	,	that	's	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	.
i	've	 decide 	 d 	 	that	,	for	me	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	i	do	n't	have	a	big	 en 	 ough 	 	head	.
so	i	think	 local 	 ly 	 	and	i	act	 local 	 ly 	 	.
i	feel	that	the	best	way	i	can	help	out	 any 	 thing 	 	is	to	help	out	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 local 	 ly 	 	.
so	ph.d.	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	degree	there	,	and	the	yadda	yadda	.
i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	to	some	 school 	 teacher 	 s 	 	about	a	year	ago	.
and	one	of	them	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	them	would	come	up	to	me	and	say	,	``	well	,	how	come	you	ai	n't	 teach 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	've	taught	graduate	--	i	've	had	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	,	i	've	taught	 under 	 graduate 	 	 class 	 es 	 	.	``
no	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	're	so	 in 	 to 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	how	come	you	ai	n't	over	here	on	the	front	lines	?
put	your	money	where	you	mouth	is	.	``
is	true	.	is	true	.	i	teach	eighth	-	grade	science	four	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	.
not	just	 show 	 ing 	 	up	every	now	and	then	.
no	,	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	.	i	take	 attend 	 ance 	 	.
i	take	lunch	hour	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	--	no	,	no	,	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 clap 	 s 	 	.
i	 strong 	 ly 	 	suggest	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	thing	for	each	of	you	to	do	.
not	just	show	up	to	class	every	now	and	then	.
teach	a	solid	week	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	 teach 	 ing 	 	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	time	,	but	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	for	my	science	 student 	 s 	 	is	to	tell	them	,	``	look	,	i	'm	going	to	teach	you	college	-	level	physics	.
no	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	i	'll	cut	out	that	.
you	wo	n't	need	to	know	 t 	 rig 	 	.
but	you	will	need	to	know	eighth	-	grade	algebra	,	and	we	're	going	to	do	serious	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	open	-	to	-	chapter	-	seven	-	and	-	do	-	all	-	the	-	odd	-	problem	-	 set 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	genuine	physics	.	``
and	that	's	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	thought	i	'd	do	right	now	.
oh	,	before	i	even	turn	that	on	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	did	about	three	 week 	 s 	 	ago	in	my	class	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	through	the	lens	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	used	a	lens	for	was	to	measure	the	speed	of	light	.
my	 student 	 s 	 	in	el	cerrito	--	with	my	help	,	of	course	,	and	with	the	help	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	beat	up	 oscill 	 o 	 scope 	 	--	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	speed	of	light	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	off	by	25	percent	.	how	 man 	 y 	 	eighth	graders	do	you	know	of	who	have	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	speed	of	light	?
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	,	we	've	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	speed	of	sound	.
i	'd	love	to	measure	the	speed	of	light	here	.
i	was	all	set	to	do	it	and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	aw	man	,	``	i	was	just	going	to	impose	 up 	 on 	 	the	 power 	 s 	 	that	be	,	and	measure	the	speed	of	light	.
and	i	'm	all	set	to	do	it	.	i	'm	all	set	to	do	it	,	but	then	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	to	set	up	here	,	you	have	like	10	 minute 	 s 	 	to	set	up	!
and	there	's	no	time	to	do	it	.
so	,	next	time	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	i	'll	measure	the	speed	of	light	!
but	 mean 	 while 	 	,	let	's	measure	the	speed	of	sound	!
well	,	the	obvious	way	to	measure	the	speed	of	sound	is	to	 bounc 	 e 	 	sound	off	 some 	 thing 	 	and	look	at	the	echo	.
but	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	--	one	of	my	 student 	 s 	 	,	ariel	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	could	we	measure	the	speed	of	light	using	the	wave	 equ 	 ation 	 	?	``
and	all	of	you	know	the	wave	 equ 	 ation 	 	is	the	frequency	 time 	 s 	 	the	 wave 	 length 	 	of	any	wave	...
is	a	constant	.	when	the	frequency	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	the	 wave 	 length 	 	 come 	 s 	 	down	.	 wave 	 length 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	frequency	 go 	 es 	 	down	.	so	,	if	we	have	a	wave	here	--	over	here	,	that	's	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	the	pitch	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	 thing 	 s 	 	get	 close 	 r 	 	,	pitch	 go 	 es 	 	down	,	 thing 	 s 	 	stretch	out	.
right	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	simple	physics	.
all	of	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	from	eighth	grade	,	remember	?
what	they	did	n't	tell	you	in	physics	--	in	eighth	-	grade	physics	--	but	they	should	have	,	and	i	wish	they	had	,	was	that	if	you	 multi 	 ply 	 	the	frequency	 time 	 s 	 	the	 wave 	 length 	 	of	sound	or	light	,	you	get	a	constant	.
and	that	constant	is	the	speed	of	sound	.
so	,	in	order	to	measure	the	speed	of	sound	,	all	i	've	got	to	do	is	know	 it 	 s 	 	frequency	.	well	,	that	's	easy	.
i	've	got	a	frequency	counter	right	here	.
set	it	up	to	around	a	,	above	a	,	above	a.	there	's	an	a	,	more	or	less	.
now	,	so	i	know	the	frequency	.
it	's	1.76	 kilo 	 hertz 	 	.	i	measure	 it 	 s 	 	 wave 	 length 	 	.
all	i	need	now	is	to	flip	on	 an 	 other 	 	beam	,	and	the	bottom	beam	is	me	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	right	?
so	 any 	 time 	 	i	talk	,	you	'd	see	it	on	the	screen	.
i	'll	put	it	over	here	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	move	 th 	 is 	 	away	from	the	source	,	you	'll	notice	the	spiral	.
the	 s 	 link 	 y 	 	 move 	 s 	 	.	we	're	going	through	different	 nod 	 es 	 	of	the	wave	,	coming	out	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	i	hear	you	 roll 	 ing 	 	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	bear	with	me	.
to	measure	the	 wave 	 length 	 	,	all	i	need	to	do	is	measure	the	distance	from	here	--	one	full	wave	--	over	to	here	.
from	here	to	here	is	the	 wave 	 length 	 	of	sound	.
so	,	i	'll	put	a	 measur 	 ing 	 	tape	here	,	 measur 	 ing 	 	tape	here	,	move	it	back	over	to	here	.
i	've	 move 	 d 	 	the	 micro 	 phone 	 	20	 centimeter 	 s 	 	.
0.2	 meter 	 s 	 	from	here	,	back	to	here	,	20	 centimeter 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	let	's	go	back	to	mr.	elmo	.
and	we	'll	say	the	frequency	is	1.76	 kilo 	 hertz 	 	,	or	1760	.
the	 wave 	 length 	 	was	0.2	 meter 	 s 	 	.
let	's	figure	out	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
1.76	 time 	 s 	 	0.2	over	here	is	352	 meter 	 s 	 	per	second	.
if	you	look	it	up	in	the	book	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	343	.
but	,	here	with	kludgy	material	,	and	 lous 	 y 	 	drink	--	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	measure	the	speed	of	sound	to	--	not	bad	.	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
all	of	which	 come 	 s 	 	to	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	.
go	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	picture	of	me	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	was	1971	,	the	vietnam	war	was	going	on	,	and	i	'm	like	,	``	oh	my	god	!	``
i	'm	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	physics	:	landau	,	lipschitz	,	resnick	and	halliday	.
i	'm	going	home	for	a	 mid 	 term 	 	.	a	riot	's	going	on	on	campus	.
there	's	a	riot	!	 he 	 y 	 	,	elmo	's	 d 	 one 	 	:	off	.
there	's	a	riot	going	on	on	campus	,	and	the	police	are	chasing	me	,	right	?
i	'm	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	campus	.	cop	 come 	 s 	 	and	 look 	 s 	 	at	me	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	!	you	're	a	student	.	``
 pull 	 s 	 	out	a	gun	.	 go 	 es 	 	boom	!
and	a	tear	gas	 can 	 ist 	 er 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	pepsi	can	 go 	 es 	 	by	my	head	.	 who 	 osh 	 	!
i	get	a	breath	of	tear	gas	and	i	ca	n't	breathe	.
 th 	 is 	 	cop	 come 	 s 	 	after	me	with	a	rifle	.
he	 want 	 s 	 	to	clunk	me	over	the	head	!
i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	got	to	clear	out	of	here	!	``
i	go	running	 a 	 cross 	 	campus	quick	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	.	i	duck	 in 	 to 	 	hayes	hall	.
it	's	one	of	these	bell	-	tower	 building 	 s 	 	.
the	cop	's	chasing	me	.
chasing	me	up	the	first	floor	,	second	floor	,	third	floor	.
 chase 	 s 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
the	 en 	 trance 	 way 	 	to	the	bell	tower	.
i	 s 	 lam 	 	the	door	 be 	 hind 	 	me	,	climb	up	,	go	past	 th 	 is 	 	place	where	i	see	a	pendulum	 tick 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	the	square	root	of	the	length	is	 proportion 	 al 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	period	.	``
i	keep	 climb 	 ing 	 	up	,	go	back	.
i	go	to	a	place	where	a	 do 	 wel 	 	 split 	 s 	 	off	.
there	's	a	clock	,	clock	,	clock	,	clock	.
the	time	's	going	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 in 	 side 	 	of	it	.
i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	of	lorenz	 contract 	 ions 	 	and	einsteinian	 relat 	 ivity 	 	.
i	climb	up	,	and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	way	in	the	back	,	that	you	climb	up	 th 	 is 	 	 wood 	 en 	 	 lad 	 der 	 	.
i	pop	up	the	top	,	and	there	's	a	cupola	.
a	 dom 	 e 	 	,	one	of	these	ten	-	foot	 dom 	 es 	 	.
i	'm	looking	out	and	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 cop 	 s 	 	 bash 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	'	 head 	 s 	 	,	 shoot 	 ing 	 	tear	gas	,	and	 watch 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	 throw 	 ing 	 	 brick 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	am	i	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?	why	am	i	here	?	``
then	i	remember	what	my	english	teacher	in	high	school	 s 	 aid 	 	.
 name 	 ly 	 	,	that	when	they	cast	 bell 	 s 	 	,	they	write	 in 	 script 	 ions 	 	on	them	.
so	,	i	wipe	the	pigeon	 man 	 ure 	 	off	one	of	the	 bell 	 s 	 	,	and	i	look	at	it	.
i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	why	am	i	here	?	``
so	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	the	 word 	 s 	 	 in 	 scribed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	the	hayes	hall	tower	 bell 	 s 	 	:	``	all	truth	is	one	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	light	,	may	science	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	endeavor	here	for	the	 stead 	 y 	 	evolution	of	 man 	 kind 	 	,	from	 dark 	 ness 	 	to	light	,	from	 narrow 	 ness 	 	to	broad	-	mindedness	,	from	prejudice	to	 toler 	 ance 	 	.
it	is	the	voice	of	life	,	which	 call 	 s 	 	us	to	come	and	learn	.	``
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
