i	was	 inform 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 un 	 original 	 	and	 t 	 rite 	 	idea	that	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	social	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	what	drove	me	then	,	and	still	,	it	's	a	delusion	that	 drive 	 s 	 	me	now	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	update	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	since	then	--	but	it	's	still	the	same	theme	song	--	and	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	my	lab	and	current	work	,	which	is	the	 environment 	 al 	 	health	clinic	that	i	run	at	nyu	.
and	what	it	is	--	it	's	a	twist	on	health	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	now	is	 re 	 define 	 	what	 count 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	health	.
it	's	a	clinic	like	a	health	clinic	at	any	other	university	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	people	come	to	the	clinic	with	 environment 	 al 	 	health	 concern 	 s 	 	,	and	they	walk	out	with	 prescription 	 s 	 	for	 thing 	 s 	 	they	can	do	to	improve	 environment 	 al 	 	health	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	coming	to	a	clinic	with	medical	 concern 	 s 	 	and	 walk 	 ing 	 	out	with	 prescription 	 s 	 	for	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 hand 	 y 	 	-	 dan 	 dy 	 	quote	from	hippocrates	of	the	hippocratic	 oa 	 th 	 	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	 great 	 er 	 	part	of	the	soul	 lay 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	body	,	 treat 	 ment 	 	of	the	inner	 requir 	 es 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	of	the	 out 	 er 	 	.	``
but	that	 suggest 	 s 	 	the	issue	that	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	at	here	,	that	we	have	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 re 	 define 	 	what	is	health	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	health	is	internal	and	 atom 	 ized 	 	and	individual	and	pharmaceutical	is	 large 	 ly 	 	an	error	.
and	i	would	use	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	a	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	by	philip	landrigan	,	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	a	different	view	of	health	,	where	he	went	to	most	of	the	 pediatric 	 ians 	 	in	manhattan	and	the	new	york	area	and	 log 	 ged 	 	what	they	 s 	 pent 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	patient	 hour 	 s 	 	on	.
80	to	90	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	was	 s 	 pent 	 	on	five	 thing 	 s 	 	.
number	one	was	asthma	,	number	two	was	 develop 	 mental 	 	 delay 	 s 	 	,	number	three	was	400	-	fold	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	rare	 child 	 hood 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	in	the	last	eight	to	10	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
number	four	and	five	 we 	 re 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	 obes 	 ity 	 	and	diabetes	-	related	 issue 	 s 	 	.
so	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	--	what	's	common	about	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	?
the	environment	is	 implic 	 ated 	 	,	 radical 	 ly 	 	 implic 	 ated 	 	,	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	 germ 	 s 	 	that	 medic 	 os 	 	 we 	 re 	 	trained	to	deal	with	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	different	definition	of	health	,	health	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	great	advantage	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	external	,	it	's	 share 	 d 	 	,	we	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	internal	,	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 pre 	 determine 	 d 	 	or	 individual 	 ized 	 	.
people	who	come	to	the	clinic	are	 call 	 ed 	 	,	not	 patient 	 s 	 	,	but	 im 	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	too	 im 	 patient 	 	to	wait	for	 legisl 	 ative 	 	change	to	address	local	and	 environment 	 al 	 	health	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	i	meet	them	at	the	university	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	few	field	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	that	i	set	up	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 place 	 s 	 	that	provide	an	 immers 	 ion 	 	in	some	of	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	we	face	.
i	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	from	the	belgian	field	 off 	 ice 	 	,	where	we	met	in	a	 round 	 about 	 	,	 precise 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 round 	 about 	 	 icon 	 ified 	 	the	 head 	 less 	 	social	 move 	 ment 	 	that	 inform 	 s 	 	much	social	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	the	top	-	down	control	of	red	light	traffic	 intersect 	 ions 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	of	course	,	the	 round 	 about 	 	with	that	micro	-	 decision 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	made	in	situ	by	people	not	 be 	 ing 	 	told	what	to	do	.
but	,	of	course	,	 afford 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	 through 	 put 	 	,	 few 	 er 	 	 accident 	 s 	 	,	and	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	model	of	social	 move 	 ment 	 	.
some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	the	 monitor 	 ing 	 	 proto 	 col 	 s 	 	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	tadpole	bureaucrat	 proto 	 col 	 	,	or	 keep 	 ing 	 	 tab 	 s 	 	,	if	you	will	.
what	they	are	is	an	 add 	 ition 	 	of	 tadpole 	 s 	 	that	are	named	after	a	local	bureaucrat	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	affect	your	water	quality	.
so	an	 im 	 patient 	 	concern	for	water	quality	would	raise	a	tadpole	bureaucrat	in	a	 s 	 ample 	 	of	water	in	which	they	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	give	them	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	that	,	to	help	them	do	companion	animal	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	while	they	're	 b 	 logging 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	email	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tadpole	 walk 	 er 	 	to	take	your	tadpole	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	using	 tadpole 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	the	most	exquisite	 bio 	 sense 	 s 	 	that	we	have	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 order 	 s 	 	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	more	sensitive	than	some	of	our	 sense 	 s 	 	for	 sens 	 ing 	 	,	 respond 	 ing 	 	in	a	 bio 	 logically 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	way	,	to	that	whole	class	of	industrial	 contami 	 nant 	 s 	 	we	call	 endo 	 cr 	 ine 	 	 disrupt 	 ors 	 	or	hormone	 emul 	 ators 	 	.
but	by	taking	your	tadpole	out	for	a	walk	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	--	there	's	a	few	action	 shot 	 s 	 	--	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	are	 like 	 ly 	 	to	say	,	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	then	you	have	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	your	tadpole	and	who	it	's	named	after	.
you	have	to	explain	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	and	how	the	 develop 	 mental 	 	 event 	 s 	 	of	a	tadpole	are	,	of	course	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 observ 	 able 	 	and	they	use	the	same	t	3	-	 mediate 	 d 	 	 hormone 	 s 	 	that	we	do	.
and	so	next	time	your	neighbor	 s 	 ees 	 	you	they	'll	say	,	``	how	is	that	tadpole	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	you	can	let	them	social	network	with	your	tadpole	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 environment 	 al 	 	health	clinic	 ha 	 s 	 	a	social	 network 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	for	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 im 	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 human 	 s 	 	,	but	non	-	 human 	 s 	 	,	social	 network 	 ing 	 	for	 human 	 s 	 	and	non	-	 human 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	these	 endo 	 cr 	 ine 	 	 disrupt 	 ors 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 implic 	 ated 	 	in	the	breast	cancer	 epi 	 demic 	 	,	the	 obes 	 ity 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	,	the	two	and	a	half	year	drop	in	the	average	age	of	 on 	 set 	 	of	puberty	in	young	 girl 	 s 	 	and	other	related	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	 culmin 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	if	you	've	 success 	 fully 	 	raised	your	tadpole	,	 observ 	 ing 	 	the	 behavior 	 al 	 	and	 develop 	 mental 	 	 event 	 s 	 	,	you	will	then	go	and	 introduc 	 e 	 	your	tadpole	to	 it 	 s 	 	 name 	 sake 	 	and	discuss	the	evidence	that	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	quick	 proto 	 col 	 	--	and	i	'm	going	to	go	through	these	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	but	just	to	give	you	the	material	sense	of	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	here	--	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	for	 urin 	 e 	 	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	i	'll	ask	you	for	a	mouse	 s 	 ample 	 	.
 any 	 one 	 	here	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	share	,	to	 co 	 habit 	 	with	a	mouse	--	a	domestic	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	 mic 	 e 	 	?
 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	.
 mic 	 e 	 	,	of	course	,	are	the	 quint 	 essential 	 	model	organism	.
they	're	even	better	 model 	 s 	 	of	 environment 	 al 	 	health	,	 be 	 cause 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	same	 mammal 	 ian 	 	biology	,	but	they	share	your	diet	,	 large 	 ly 	 	.
they	share	your	 environment 	 al 	 	 stress 	 ors 	 	,	the	asbestos	 level 	 s 	 	and	lead	 level 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	you	're	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	.
and	they	're	 geo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	more	 limit 	 ed 	 	than	you	are	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	know	if	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	 persist 	 ent 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 pollutant 	 s 	 	in	your	home	,	or	 occupation 	 ally 	 	or	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	.
 mic 	 e 	 	are	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 represent 	 ation 	 	.
so	it	 start 	 s 	 	by	building	a	better	 mouse 	 trap 	 	,	of	course	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	them	.
 cop 	 ing 	 	with	 environment 	 al 	 	 stress 	 ors 	 	is	 trick 	 y 	 	.
is	 any 	 body 	 	here	on	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	?
there	's	a	lot	of	people	in	manhattan	are	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	if	the	 mic 	 e 	 	would	 al 	 so 	 	self	-	administer	ssris	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	prozac	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	zoloft	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	black	 jelly 	 bean 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	muscle	 relax 	 ant 	 	,	all	of	which	 we 	 re 	 	the	 medic 	 ations 	 	that	the	 im 	 patient 	 	was	taking	.
so	do	you	think	the	 mic 	 e 	 	self	-	 administer 	 ed 	 	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	?
what	's	the	--	how	did	you	know	that	?	they	did	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	vodka	and	solution	,	gin	and	solution	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	 al 	 so 	 	 like 	 d 	 	plain	water	and	the	muscle	 relax 	 ant 	 	.
where	's	our	export	?
vodka	,	gin	--	 y 	 es 	 	.	 y 	 es 	 	.	you	know	your	 mic 	 e 	 	well	.
they	did	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
so	they	 d 	 rank 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	vodka	 a 	 s 	 	they	did	plain	water	,	which	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
then	of	course	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 en 	 trap 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
there	's	an	old	 cell 	 phone 	 	in	there	--	a	good	use	for	old	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	--	which	 dial 	 s 	 	the	clinic	,	we	go	and	pick	up	the	mouse	.
we	take	the	blood	 s 	 ample 	 	and	do	the	blood	work	and	hair	work	on	the	 mic 	 e 	 	.
and	i	want	to	sort	of	point	out	the	big	advantage	of	framing	health	in	 th 	 is 	 	external	way	.
but	we	do	have	a	few	prescription	 product 	 s 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	the	medical	model	.
 any 	 thing 	 	you	do	to	improve	your	water	quality	or	air	quality	,	or	to	understand	it	or	to	change	it	,	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	are	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	by	 any 	 one 	 	you	share	that	water	quality	or	air	quality	with	.
and	that	 aggreg 	 ating 	 	effect	,	that	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	effect	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	use	to	our	advantage	.
so	i	want	to	show	you	one	prescription	product	in	the	clinic	 call 	 ed 	 	the	no	park	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	prescription	to	improve	water	quality	.
 man 	 y 	 	 im 	 patient 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	for	water	quality	and	air	quality	.
what	we	do	is	we	take	a	fire	hydrant	,	a	``	no	 park 	 ing 	 	``	space	 associate 	 d 	 	with	a	fire	hydrant	,	and	we	 pre 	 scribe 	 	the	removal	of	the	asphalt	to	create	an	engineered	micro	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	to	create	an	 in 	 filtration 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	know	,	that	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	burden	that	we	have	on	the	new	york	,	new	jersey	harbor	right	now	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	point	 source 	 s 	 	,	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	big	 pollute 	 rs 	 	,	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	ges	,	but	that	massive	network	of	 road 	 s 	 	,	[	 t 	 hose 	 	]	 imper 	 vi 	 ous 	 	 surface 	 s 	 	,	that	collect	all	that	cadmium	 neuro 	 toxin 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	your	brake	 liner 	 s 	 	or	the	 oil 	 y 	 	 hydro 	 carbon 	 	waste	in	every	single	storm	event	and	 med 	 ieval 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	 wash 	 es 	 	it	straight	 in 	 to 	 	the	 est 	 uary 	 	system	.
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	a	lot	of	good	.
these	are	little	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	 inter 	 cept 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 pollutant 	 s 	 	before	they	enter	the	harbor	,	and	they	're	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 im 	 patient 	 s 	 	on	 vari 	 ous 	 	city	 block 	 s 	 	in	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	.
i	just	want	to	say	it	was	sort	of	a	rule	of	thumb	 th 	 ough 	 	,	there	's	about	two	or	three	fire	 hydrant 	 s 	 	on	every	city	block	.
by	creating	engineered	micro	 land 	 scapes 	 	to	 infilt 	 rate 	 	in	them	,	we	do	n't	prevent	them	from	 be 	 ing 	 	used	 a 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	vehicle	 park 	 ing 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	a	 fire 	 truck 	 	can	come	and	park	there	.
they	flatten	a	few	 plant 	 s 	 	.	no	big	deal	,	they	'll	 re 	 generate 	 	.
but	if	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	in	every	single	--	every	fire	hydrant	we	could	 re 	 define 	 	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	.
that	99	percent	of	the	time	when	a	 fire 	 truck 	 	is	not	 park 	 ing 	 	there	,	it	's	 infilt 	 rating 	 	 pollutant 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	increasing	 fix 	 ing 	 	co	2s	,	 sequest 	 er 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	 air 	 borne 	 	 pollutant 	 s 	 	.
and	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	,	these	 small 	 er 	 	 inter 	 ception 	 s 	 	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 infilt 	 rate 	 	all	the	 road 	 borne 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	that	now	 run 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 est 	 uary 	 	system	,	up	to	a	seven	inch	rain	event	,	up	to	a	hundred	-	year	storm	.
so	these	are	small	 action 	 s 	 	that	can	amount	to	a	significant	effect	to	improve	local	 environment 	 al 	 	health	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	more	 ambit 	 ious 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
what	the	climate	crisis	 ha 	 s 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	to	us	is	a	 second 	 ary 	 	,	more	 insid 	 ious 	 	and	more	pervasive	crisis	,	which	is	the	crisis	of	 age 	 ncy 	 	,	which	is	what	to	do	.
 some 	 how 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	local	lettuce	,	changing	a	light	bulb	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	speed	limit	,	changing	your	 tire 	 s 	 	 regular 	 ly 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	sufficient	in	the	face	of	climate	crisis	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	icon	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	you	remember	these	:	 fall 	 out 	 	 shelter 	 s 	 	.
what	is	the	 fall 	 out 	 	shelter	for	the	climate	crisis	?
 th 	 is 	 	was	civic	 mobil 	 ization 	 	.
 church 	 es 	 	,	school	 group 	 s 	 	,	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	private	 resident 	 s 	 	--	 every 	 one 	 	built	one	of	these	in	a	matter	of	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	they	still	remain	 a 	 s 	 	 icon 	 s 	 	of	civic	 respons 	 e 	 	in	the	face	of	 share 	 d 	 	,	 un 	 certain 	 	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	threat	.
 fall 	 out 	 	shelter	for	the	climate	crisis	,	i	would	say	,	 look 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	an	intensive	urban	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	that	's	due	to	go	on	my	lab	building	at	nyu	.
what	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	idea	of	taking	--	80	to	90	percent	of	the	co	2	 produce 	 d 	 	in	manhattan	is	building	related	--	we	take	,	just	like	a	commercial	 green 	 house 	 	,	we	take	the	co	2	from	the	building	--	co	2	-	 enrich 	 ed 	 	air	--	we	force	it	through	the	urban	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	,	and	then	we	 re 	 supply 	 	oxygen	-	 enrich 	 ed 	 	air	.
you	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	build	much	on	a	roof	,	they	're	not	designed	for	that	.
so	it	's	on	 leg 	 s 	 	,	so	it	 focus 	 es 	 	all	the	load	on	the	 mason 	 ry 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	and	the	 column 	 s 	 	.
it	's	built	 a 	 s 	 	a	barn	raising	,	using	open	source	 hard 	 ware 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	quarter	-	scale	prototype	that	was	 function 	 ing 	 	in	spain	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	will	look	like	,	 finger 	 s 	 	 cross 	 ed 	 	,	nyu	 will 	 ing 	 	.
and	what	i	want	to	show	you	is	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 component 	 s 	 	of	it	that	we	've	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	--	which	is	a	solar	chimney	--	we	have	got	17	of	them	now	put	around	new	york	at	the	moment	--	that	 pass 	 ively 	 	 draw 	 s 	 	air	up	.
you	understand	a	solar	chimney	.
hot	air	 rise 	 s 	 	.
you	put	a	bit	of	black	plastic	on	the	side	of	a	building	,	it	'll	heat	up	,	and	you	'll	get	 pass 	 ive 	 	 air 	 flow 	 	.
what	we	do	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	a	standard	hvac	filter	on	the	top	of	that	.
that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 move 	 s 	 	about	95	percent	of	the	carbon	black	,	that	stuff	that	,	with	 o 	 zone 	 	,	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	about	half	of	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	's	 effect 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 change 	 s 	 	,	it	 settle 	 s 	 	on	the	snow	,	it	 change 	 s 	 	the	 reflect 	 ors 	 	,	it	 change 	 s 	 	the	 trans 	 mission 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	the	atmosphere	.
carbon	black	is	that	 grim 	 e 	 	that	 other 	 wise 	 	 lodge 	 s 	 	in	your	 pre 	 tty 	 	pink	 lung 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 associate 	 d 	 	with	.
it	's	not	good	stuff	,	and	it	's	from	 in 	 efficient 	 	 com 	 bust 	 ion 	 	,	not	from	 com 	 bust 	 ion 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
when	we	put	it	through	our	solar	chimney	,	we	 re 	 move 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	95	percent	of	that	.
and	then	i	swap	it	out	with	the	 student 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	re	-	 re 	 lease 	 	that	carbon	black	.
and	we	make	 pencil 	 s 	 	the	length	of	which	 measure 	 s 	 	the	 grim 	 e 	 	that	we	've	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	air	.
here	's	one	of	them	that	we	have	up	now	.
here	's	who	put	them	up	and	who	are	avid	pencil	 user 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	i	want	to	show	you	just	two	more	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	one	of	our	big	 challeng 	 es 	 	is	re	-	 imagin 	 ing 	 	our	relationship	to	natural	 system 	 s 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	model	of	 twist 	 ed 	 	 personal 	 ized 	 	health	,	but	through	the	 animal 	 s 	 	with	whom	we	 co 	 habit 	 	.
we	are	not	 al 	 one 	 	;	the	 animal 	 s 	 	are	moving	in	.
in	fact	,	urban	 migr 	 ation 	 	now	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	wild	 in 	 to 	 	urban	 center 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	coyote	in	central	park	,	a	whale	in	the	gowanus	 can 	 al 	 	,	 el 	 k 	 	in	westchester	 count 	 y 	 	.
it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	for	loss	of	 habit 	 at 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	our	cities	are	a	little	bit	more	 liv 	 able 	 	than	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
and	every	green	space	we	create	is	an	 invit 	 ation 	 	for	non	-	 human 	 s 	 	to	 co 	 habit 	 	with	us	.
but	we	've	kind	of	 lack 	 ed 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	in	how	we	could	do	that	well	or	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	want	to	show	you	a	few	of	the	 techno 	 logical 	 	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	under	the	 mon 	 ik 	 er 	 	of	ooz	--	which	is	zoo	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	and	 with 	 out 	 	 cage 	 s 	 	--	to	try	and	reform	that	relationship	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	communication	technology	for	 bird 	 s 	 	.	i	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
when	a	bird	 land 	 s 	 	on	it	,	they	trigger	a	sound	file	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	whitney	museum	,	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	six	of	them	,	each	of	which	had	a	different	argument	on	it	,	different	sound	file	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 record 	 ed 	 	voice	:	here	's	what	you	need	to	do	.
go	down	there	and	buy	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	health	food	 bar 	 s 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	you	call	bird	food	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	here	and	scatter	it	around	.
there	's	a	good	person	.
natalie	jeremijenko	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	there	was	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	these	.
the	 bird 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	jump	from	one	to	the	other	.
these	are	just	your	average	urban	pigeon	.
and	an	early	test	which	argument	 elicit 	 ed 	 	 co 	 operative 	 	behavior	from	the	people	 be 	 low 	 	--	about	a	hundred	to	one	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	argument	that	 work 	 ed 	 	best	on	us	.
 record 	 ed 	 	voice	:	tick	,	tick	,	tick	.
that	's	the	sound	of	genetic	 mutation 	 s 	 	of	the	 av 	 ian 	 	flu	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 dead 	 ly 	 	human	flu	.
do	you	know	what	 s 	 low 	 s 	 	it	down	?
 health 	 y 	 	sub	-	 population 	 s 	 	of	 bird 	 s 	 	,	increasing	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	.
it	is	in	your	 interest 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 health 	 y 	 	,	happy	,	well	-	fed	.
 h 	 ence 	 	,	you	could	share	some	of	your	 nutrition 	 al 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 monopol 	 izing 	 	them	.
that	is	,	share	your	lunch	.
nj	:	it	 work 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	's	true	.
the	final	project	i	'd	like	to	show	you	is	a	new	 inter 	 face 	 	for	fish	that	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	--	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 official 	 ly 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	next	week	--	with	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	commission	from	the	 architect 	 ural 	 	league	.
you	may	not	have	known	that	you	need	to	communicate	with	fish	,	but	there	is	now	a	 de 	 vice 	 	for	you	to	do	so	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	 buoy 	 s 	 	that	float	on	the	water	,	project	three	foot	up	,	three	foot	down	.
when	a	fish	 swim 	 s 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	,	a	light	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
so	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	function	on	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	top	light	is	--	i	'm	sorry	if	i	'm	making	you	 sea 	 sick 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	top	light	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	water	quality	 dis 	 play 	 	that	 shift 	 s 	 	from	red	,	when	the	 dis 	 solve 	 d 	 	oxygen	is	low	,	to	a	blue	/	green	,	when	 it 	 s 	 	 dis 	 solve 	 d 	 	oxygen	is	high	.
and	then	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	text	the	fish	.
so	there	's	business	 card 	 s 	 	down	there	that	'll	give	you	contact	 detail 	 s 	 	.
and	they	text	back	.
when	the	 buoy 	 s 	 	get	your	text	,	they	wink	at	you	twice	to	say	,	we	've	got	your	 mess 	 age 	 	.
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	popular	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	we	've	got	 an 	 other 	 	array	of	these	 boy 	 s 	 	in	the	bronx	river	,	where	the	first	 be 	 a 	 ver 	 	--	crazy	 a 	 s 	 	he	is	--	to	have	 move 	 d 	 	in	and	built	a	lodge	in	new	york	in	250	 year 	 s 	 	,	 hang 	 s 	 	out	.
so	 update 	 s 	 	from	a	 be 	 a 	 ver 	 	.
you	can	 sub 	 scribe 	 	to	 update 	 s 	 	from	him	.	you	can	talk	to	him	.
and	what	i	like	to	think	of	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 inter 	 face 	 	that	re	-	 script 	 s 	 	how	we	interact	with	natural	 system 	 s 	 	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	by	changing	who	 ha 	 s 	 	information	,	where	they	have	it	,	who	can	make	sense	of	that	information	,	and	what	you	can	do	about	it	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 throw 	 ing 	 	 chew 	 ing 	 	gum	,	or	doritos	or	 what 	 ever 	 	you	have	in	your	pocket	at	the	fish	--	there	's	a	body	of	water	in	iceland	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	that	's	in	the	middle	of	the	city	,	and	the	largest	 poll 	 ution 	 	burden	on	it	is	not	the	 road 	 borne 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	white	bread	from	people	 feed 	 ing 	 	the	fish	and	the	 bird 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	some	fish	 stick 	 s 	 	that	you	can	feed	the	fish	.
they	're	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
they	're	cross	-	species	 delic 	 ious 	 	that	is	,	 delic 	 ious 	 	for	 human 	 s 	 	and	non	-	 human 	 s 	 	.
but	they	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	 chel 	 ating 	 	agent	in	them	.
they	're	 nutrition 	 ally 	 	appropriate	,	not	like	doritos	.
and	so	every	time	that	 desir 	 e 	 	to	interact	with	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	which	is	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	sign	:	``	do	not	feed	the	 animal 	 s 	 	.	``
and	there	's	about	three	of	them	on	every	new	york	city	park	.
and	yellowstone	national	park	,	there	's	more	``	do	not	feed	the	 animal 	 s 	 	``	 sign 	 s 	 	than	there	are	 animal 	 s 	 	you	might	wish	to	feed	.
but	in	that	action	,	that	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	by	re	-	 script 	 ing 	 	that	,	by	changing	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 	food	that	is	 nutrition 	 ally 	 	appropriate	,	that	could	augment	the	 nutrition 	 al 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	that	we	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	have	 deplete 	 d 	 	for	 augment 	 ing 	 	the	fish	population	and	 al 	 so 	 	 add 	 ing 	 	 chel 	 ating 	 	agent	,	which	,	like	any	 chel 	 ating 	 	agent	that	we	use	medicinally	,	 bind 	 s 	 	to	the	bioaccumulated	heavy	 metal 	 s 	 	and	pcbs	that	are	in	the	fish	living	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 habit 	 at 	 	and	 allow 	 s 	 	them	to	pass	it	out	 a 	 s 	 	a	 harm 	 less 	 	salt	where	it	's	complexed	by	a	 re 	 active 	 	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	 re 	 moving 	 	it	from	bioavailability	.
but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	that	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	re	-	 script 	 ing 	 	that	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	 remedi 	 ative 	 	action	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	the	approach	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	used	on	the	other	side	on	the	hudson	river	,	where	we	're	 dredg 	 ing 	 	the	pcbs	--	after	30	 year 	 s 	 	of	 legisl 	 ative 	 	and	legal	struggle	,	ge	's	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	the	 dredg 	 ing 	 	of	the	largest	superfund	 s 	 ite 	 	in	the	world	--	we	're	 dredg 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	it	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	get	 ship 	 ped 	 	off	to	pennsylvania	or	the	 near 	 est 	 	third	world	country	,	where	it	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	be	toxic	sludge	.
 dis 	 placement 	 	is	not	the	way	to	deal	with	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 typical 	 ly 	 	the	paradigm	under	which	we	've	 oper 	 ated 	 	.
by	 actual 	 ly 	 	taking	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	that	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	new	 inter 	 active 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	present	to	re	-	script	our	 interact 	 ions 	 	,	to	script	them	,	not	just	 a 	 s 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	,	 individu 	 ated 	 	 interact 	 ions 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	 aggreg 	 ating 	 	 action 	 s 	 	that	can	amount	to	 some 	 thing 	 	,	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	begin	to	address	some	of	our	 import 	 ant 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
thank	you	.
