i	want	to	talk	about	4.6	billion	 year 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	18	 minute 	 s 	 	.
that	's	300	million	 year 	 s 	 	per	minute	.
let	's	start	with	the	first	photograph	nasa	 obtain 	 ed 	 	of	planet	mars	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	fly	-	by	,	mariner	iv	.
it	was	taken	in	1965	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 appear 	 ed 	 	,	that	well	-	known	scientific	journal	,	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	wrote	in	 it 	 s 	 	 editor 	 ial 	 	,	``	mars	is	 un 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	a	dead	world	.	nasa	should	not	 s 	 pend 	 	any	time	or	effort	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	mars	 any 	 more 	 	.	``
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	our	 lead 	 ers 	 	in	washington	at	nasa	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	 k 	 new 	 	better	and	we	 beg 	 an 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 extens 	 ive 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	of	the	red	planet	.
one	of	the	key	 question 	 s 	 	in	all	of	science	,	``	is	there	life	 out 	 side 	 	of	earth	?	``
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	mars	is	the	most	 like 	 ly 	 	target	for	life	 out 	 side 	 	the	earth	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	in	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 measure 	 ments 	 	that	suggest	there	may	be	life	on	mars	.
but	let	me	start	with	a	viking	photograph	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	composite	taken	by	viking	in	1976	.
viking	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	and	 manage 	 d 	 	at	the	nasa	langley	research	center	.
we	 s 	 ent 	 	two	 orbit 	 ers 	 	and	two	 land 	 ers 	 	in	the	summer	of	1976	.
we	had	four	 space 	 craft 	 	,	two	around	mars	,	two	on	the	surface	--	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 accomplish 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	photograph	taken	from	the	surface	of	any	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	viking	 land 	 er 	 	photograph	of	the	surface	of	mars	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	the	red	planet	is	red	.
mars	is	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	earth	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	is	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	water	,	the	land	area	on	mars	is	 compar 	 able 	 	to	the	land	area	on	earth	.
so	,	mars	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	place	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	.
we	have	 obtain 	 ed 	 	 topo 	 graphic 	 	 measure 	 ments 	 	of	the	surface	of	mars	.	we	understand	the	 elev 	 ation 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
we	know	a	lot	about	mars	.
mars	 ha 	 s 	 	the	largest	 volcan 	 o 	 	in	the	solar	system	,	olympus	mons	.
mars	 ha 	 s 	 	the	grand	canyon	of	the	solar	system	,	valles	marineris	.
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	planet	.
mars	 ha 	 s 	 	the	largest	impact	 crat 	 er 	 	in	the	solar	system	,	hellas	basin	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	2,000	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
if	you	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	on	mars	when	 th 	 is 	 	 impact 	 or 	 	hit	,	it	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	day	on	mars	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	olympus	mons	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 big 	 ger 	 	than	the	state	of	arizona	.
 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	produce	 atmosphere 	 s 	 	and	they	produce	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
we	're	looking	at	valles	marineris	,	the	largest	canyon	in	the	solar	system	,	 super 	 impose 	 d 	 	on	a	map	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	3,000	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
one	of	the	most	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	about	mars	,	the	national	academy	of	science	 say 	 s 	 	one	of	the	10	major	 myster 	 ies 	 	of	the	space	age	,	is	why	certain	 area 	 s 	 	of	mars	are	so	 high 	 ly 	 	 magnet 	 ized 	 	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	 crust 	 al 	 	 magnet 	 ism 	 	.
there	are	 region 	 s 	 	on	mars	,	where	,	for	some	reason	--	we	do	n't	understand	why	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	--	the	surface	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 magnet 	 ized 	 	.
is	there	water	on	mars	?
the	answer	is	no	,	there	is	no	liquid	water	on	the	surface	of	mars	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	there	is	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	evidence	that	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	the	early	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	mars	there	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	 river 	 s 	 	and	fast	 flow 	 ing 	 	water	.
 to 	 day 	 	mars	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	dry	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	there	's	some	water	in	the	polar	 cap 	 s 	 	,	there	are	polar	 cap 	 s 	 	of	north	pole	and	south	pole	.
here	are	some	 re 	 cent 	 	 image 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	spirit	and	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
these	 image 	 s 	 	that	show	at	one	time	,	there	was	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 flow 	 ing 	 	water	on	the	surface	of	mars	.
why	is	water	 import 	 ant 	 	?	water	is	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	want	life	you	have	to	have	water	.
water	is	the	key	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	in	the	evolution	,	the	origin	of	life	on	a	planet	.
here	is	some	picture	of	antarctica	and	a	picture	of	olympus	mons	,	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 feature 	 s 	 	,	 glaci 	 ers 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 froze 	 n 	 	water	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	ice	water	on	mars	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	picture	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	just	taken	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 public 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	european	space	 age 	 ncy 	 	mars	express	,	image	of	a	 crat 	 er 	 	on	mars	and	in	the	middle	of	the	 crat 	 er 	 	we	have	liquid	water	,	we	have	ice	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	photograph	.
we	now	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	the	early	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	mars	,	which	is	4.6	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	4.6	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	mars	was	 ver 	 y 	 	earth	-	like	.
mars	had	 river 	 s 	 	,	mars	had	 lake 	 s 	 	,	but	more	 import 	 ant 	 	mars	had	planetary	-	scale	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	area	in	blue	,	which	 show 	 s 	 	a	 depress 	 ion 	 	of	about	four	 mile 	 s 	 	,	was	the	ancient	ocean	area	on	the	surface	of	mars	.
where	did	the	ocean	's	worth	of	water	on	mars	go	?
well	,	we	have	an	idea	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 measure 	 ment 	 	we	 obtain 	 ed 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	from	a	mars	-	 orbit 	 ing 	 	satellite	 call 	 ed 	 	odyssey	.
sub	-	surface	water	on	mars	,	 froze 	 n 	 	in	the	form	of	ice	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	percent	.	if	it	's	a	 blue 	 ish 	 	color	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	16	percent	by	weight	.
sixteen	percent	,	by	weight	,	of	the	 in 	 terior 	 	 contain 	 s 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	water	,	or	ice	.
so	,	there	is	a	lot	of	water	 be 	 low 	 	the	surface	.
the	most	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	and	 puzzl 	 ing 	 	 measure 	 ment 	 	,	in	my	opinion	,	we	've	 obtain 	 ed 	 	of	mars	,	was	released	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	in	the	magazine	science	.
and	what	we	're	looking	at	is	the	presence	of	the	gas	 m 	 ethane 	 	,	ch	4	,	in	the	atmosphere	of	mars	.
and	you	can	see	there	are	three	distinct	 region 	 s 	 	of	 m 	 ethane 	 	.
why	is	 m 	 ethane 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	on	earth	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	--	99.9	percent	--	of	the	 m 	 ethane 	 	is	 produce 	 d 	 	by	living	 system 	 s 	 	,	not	little	green	men	,	but	 micro 	 scopic 	 	life	 be 	 low 	 	the	surface	or	at	the	surface	.
we	now	have	evidence	that	 m 	 ethane 	 	is	in	the	atmosphere	of	mars	,	a	gas	that	,	on	earth	,	is	 bio 	 genic 	 	in	origin	,	 produce 	 d 	 	by	living	 system 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	three	 plume 	 s 	 	:	a	,	b	1	,	b	2	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 terra 	 in 	 	it	 appear 	 s 	 	over	,	and	we	know	from	 geo 	 logical 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	these	 region 	 s 	 	are	the	 old 	 est 	 	 region 	 s 	 	on	mars	.
in	fact	,	the	earth	and	mars	are	both	4.6	billion	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
the	 old 	 est 	 	rock	on	earth	is	 on 	 ly 	 	3.6	billion	.
the	reason	there	is	a	billion	-	year	gap	in	our	 geo 	 logical 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	plate	 tectonic 	 s 	 	,	the	crust	of	the	earth	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 recycl 	 ed 	 	.
we	have	no	 geo 	 logical 	 	record	prior	for	the	first	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	record	 exist 	 s 	 	on	mars	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 terra 	 in 	 	that	we	're	looking	at	 date 	 s 	 	back	to	4.6	billion	 year 	 s 	 	when	earth	and	mars	 we 	 re 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	a	tuesday	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	that	 show 	 s 	 	where	we	've	put	our	 space 	 craft 	 	on	the	surface	of	mars	.
here	is	viking	i	,	viking	ii	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	spirit	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	mars	 path 	 finder 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	phoenix	,	we	just	put	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
notice	all	of	our	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	and	all	of	our	 land 	 ers 	 	have	gone	to	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	.
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	is	the	region	of	the	ancient	ocean	basin	.
there	are	n't	 man 	 y 	 	 crat 	 ers 	 	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	water	 protect 	 ed 	 	the	basin	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 impact 	 ed 	 	by	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	and	 meteorite 	 s 	 	.
but	look	in	the	southern	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	.
in	the	southern	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	there	are	impact	 crat 	 ers 	 	,	there	are	 volcan 	 ic 	 	 crat 	 ers 	 	.
here	's	hellas	basin	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	place	,	 geo 	 logically 	 	.
look	where	the	 m 	 ethane 	 	is	,	the	 m 	 ethane 	 	is	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rough	 terra 	 in 	 	area	.
what	is	the	best	way	to	unravel	the	 myster 	 ies 	 	on	mars	that	exist	?
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	 invit 	 ed 	 	10	of	the	top	mars	 scientist 	 s 	 	to	the	langley	research	center	for	two	 day 	 s 	 	.
we	 address 	 ed 	 	on	the	board	the	major	 question 	 s 	 	that	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	 answer 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	 s 	 pent 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	how	to	best	answer	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
and	the	result	of	our	 meet 	 ing 	 	was	a	robotic	rocket	-	powered	 air 	 plane 	 	we	call	ares	.
it	's	an	 a 	 erial 	 	 region 	 al 	 	-	scale	 environment 	 al 	 	 survey 	 or 	 	.
there	's	a	model	of	ares	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	20	-	percent	scale	model	.
 th 	 is 	 	 air 	 plane 	 	was	designed	at	the	langley	research	center	.
if	any	place	in	the	world	can	build	an	 air 	 plane 	 	to	fly	on	mars	,	it	's	the	langley	research	center	,	for	 al 	 most 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	a	 lead 	 ing 	 	center	of	 aeronautic 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
we	fly	about	a	mile	above	the	surface	.
we	cover	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	,	and	we	fly	about	450	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
we	can	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	ca	n't	do	and	 land 	 ers 	 	ca	n't	do	:	we	can	fly	above	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	,	impact	 crat 	 ers 	 	;	we	fly	over	 val 	 ley 	 s 	 	;	we	can	fly	over	surface	 magnet 	 ism 	 	,	the	polar	 cap 	 s 	 	,	 sub 	 surface 	 	water	;	and	we	can	search	for	life	on	mars	.
but	,	of	equal	 import 	 ance 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	fly	through	the	atmosphere	of	mars	,	we	transmit	that	journey	,	the	first	flight	of	an	 air 	 plane 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	earth	,	we	transmit	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	back	to	earth	.
and	our	goal	is	to	inspire	the	american	public	who	is	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	mission	through	tax	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 	we	will	inspire	the	next	generation	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 techno 	 logists 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	and	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	.
and	that	's	a	critical	area	of	national	security	and	economic	 vital 	 ity 	 	,	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	produce	the	next	generation	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	and	 techno 	 logists 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	ares	 look 	 s 	 	like	 a 	 s 	 	it	flies	over	mars	.
we	 pre 	 program 	 	it	.
we	will	fly	where	the	 m 	 ethane 	 	is	.
we	will	have	 instrument 	 s 	 	 a 	 board 	 	the	plane	that	will	 s 	 ample 	 	,	every	three	 minute 	 s 	 	,	the	atmosphere	of	mars	.
we	will	look	for	 m 	 ethane 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	other	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	by	living	 system 	 s 	 	.
we	will	 pin 	 point 	 	where	these	 gas 	 es 	 	emanate	from	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	measure	the	 grad 	 ient 	 	where	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	,	and	there	,	we	can	direct	the	next	mission	to	land	right	in	that	area	.
how	do	we	transport	an	 air 	 plane 	 	to	mars	?
in	two	 word 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
the	problem	is	we	do	n't	fly	it	to	mars	,	we	put	it	in	a	 space 	 craft 	 	and	we	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	mars	.
the	problem	is	the	 space 	 craft 	 	's	largest	 dia 	 meter 	 	is	nine	feet	;	ares	is	21	-	foot	 wing 	 span 	 	,	17	feet	long	.
how	do	we	get	it	to	mars	?
we	fold	it	,	and	we	transport	it	in	a	 space 	 craft 	 	.
and	we	have	it	in	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	an	 aero 	 shell 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	do	it	.
and	we	have	a	little	video	that	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	the	sequence	.

we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	a	one	-	hour	flight	we	can	 re 	 write 	 	the	 text 	 book 	 	on	mars	by	making	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	 measure 	 ments 	 	of	the	atmosphere	,	looking	for	 gas 	 es 	 	of	 bio 	 genic 	 	origin	,	looking	for	 gas 	 es 	 	of	 volcan 	 ic 	 	origin	,	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	surface	,	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 magnet 	 ism 	 	on	the	surface	,	which	we	do	n't	understand	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	about	a	dozen	other	 area 	 s 	 	.
practice	 make 	 s 	 	perfect	.
how	do	we	know	we	can	do	it	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	tested	ares	model	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 model 	 s 	 	in	a	half	a	dozen	wind	 tunnel 	 s 	 	at	the	nasa	langley	research	center	for	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	under	mars	 condition 	 s 	 	.
and	,	of	equal	 import 	 ance 	 	is	,	we	test	ares	in	the	earth	's	atmosphere	,	at	100,000	feet	,	which	is	 compar 	 able 	 	to	the	density	and	pressure	of	the	atmosphere	on	mars	where	we	'll	fly	.
now	,	100,000	feet	,	if	you	fly	cross	-	country	to	los	angeles	,	you	fly	37,000	feet	.
we	do	our	 test 	 s 	 	at	100,000	feet	.
and	i	want	to	show	you	one	of	our	 test 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	half	-	scale	model	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	high	-	altitude	 hel 	 ium 	 	balloon	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	over	tilamook	,	oregon	.
we	put	the	 fold 	 ed 	 	 air 	 plane 	 	on	the	balloon	--	it	took	about	three	 hour 	 s 	 	to	get	up	there	--	and	then	we	released	it	on	command	at	103,000	feet	,	and	we	deploy	the	 air 	 plane 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	.
and	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	high	-	altitude	and	low	-	altitude	 test 	 s 	 	,	just	to	perfect	 th 	 is 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	.
we	're	ready	to	go	.
i	have	a	scale	model	here	.
but	we	have	a	full	-	scale	model	in	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	at	the	nasa	langley	research	center	.
we	're	ready	to	go	.	all	we	need	is	a	check	from	nasa	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	to	cover	the	 cost 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	prepared	to	 don 	 ate 	 	my	 honor 	 arium 	 	for	 to 	 day 	 	's	talk	for	 th 	 is 	 	mission	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	no	 honor 	 arium 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	ares	team	;	we	have	about	150	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	;	where	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	jet	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	goddard	space	flight	center	,	ames	research	center	and	half	a	dozen	major	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	and	 corporation 	 s 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	a	large	effort	.	it	's	all	at	nasa	langley	research	center	.
