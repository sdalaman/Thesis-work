sergey	brin	:	i	want	to	discuss	a	question	i	know	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 press 	 ing 	 	on	 man 	 y 	 	of	your	 mind 	 s 	 	.
we	spoke	to	you	last	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	before	i	get	 start 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	since	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	are	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	it	out	of	the	way	.
the	answer	is	 box 	 ers 	 	.
now	i	hope	all	of	you	feel	better	.
do	you	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	might	be	?	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 one 	 	know	what	that	is	?
audience	:	 y 	 es 	 	.
sb	:	what	is	it	?
audience	:	it	's	people	logging	on	to	google	around	the	world	.
sb	:	 w 	 ow 	 	,	ok	.	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	what	it	was	when	i	first	saw	it	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 help 	 ed 	 	me	see	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	run	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	,	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 run 	 s 	 	real	time	.
here	it	's	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 log 	 ged 	 	.
but	here	you	can	see	around	the	world	how	people	are	using	google	.
and	every	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	 dot 	 s 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	20	,	30	 search 	 es 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
and	they	're	 label 	 ed 	 	by	color	right	now	,	by	language	.
so	you	can	see	:	here	we	are	in	the	u.s.	,	and	they	're	all	coming	up	red	.
there	we	are	in	monterey	--	 hope 	 fully 	 	i	can	get	it	right	.
you	can	see	that	japan	is	 bus 	 y 	 	at	night	,	right	there	.
we	have	tokyo	coming	in	in	japanese	.
there	's	a	lot	of	activity	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
there	's	a	lot	of	activity	in	india	.
there	's	some	in	the	middle	east	,	the	little	 pocket 	 s 	 	.
and	europe	,	which	is	right	now	in	the	middle	of	the	day	,	is	going	 re 	 ally 	 	strong	with	a	whole	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 language 	 s 	 	.
now	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	,	if	i	turn	 th 	 is 	 	around	here	--	 hope 	 fully 	 	i	wo	n't	shake	the	world	too	much	.
but	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	,	there	are	 place 	 s 	 	where	there	's	not	so	much	.
australia	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	just	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	there	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	should	 re 	 ally 	 	work	on	,	which	is	africa	,	which	is	just	a	few	 trick 	 les 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	in	south	africa	and	a	few	other	urban	cities	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	what	we	've	 notice 	 d 	 	is	these	 que 	 ries 	 	,	which	come	in	at	 thousand 	 s 	 	per	second	,	are	 avail 	 able 	 	 every 	 where 	 	there	is	power	.
and	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 where 	 	there	is	power	,	there	is	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	even	in	antarctica	--	well	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	of	year	--	we	from	time	to	time	will	see	a	 que 	 ry 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	up	.
and	if	we	had	it	 plot 	 ted 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	the	 inter 	 national 	 	space	station	would	have	it	,	too	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	some	of	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	we	have	here	,	is	you	can	see	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	hard	to	get	the	--	there	we	go	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	have	to	move	the	bits	around	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	the	people	the	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	that	there	's	a	lot	of	data	running	around	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	go	all	over	the	world	:	through	 fiber 	 s 	 	,	through	 satellite 	 s 	 	,	through	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
and	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 trick 	 y 	 	for	us	to	maintain	the	 lat 	 encies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	low	 a 	 s 	 	we	try	to	.	 hope 	 fully 	 	your	experience	is	good	.
but	you	can	see	 al 	 so 	 	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	--	so	some	 place 	 s 	 	are	much	more	wired	than	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	see	all	the	 band 	 width 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	u.s.	,	going	up	over	to	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	europe	in	the	other	direction	,	and	so	forth	.
now	what	i	would	like	to	do	is	just	to	show	you	what	one	second	of	 th 	 is 	 	activity	would	look	like	.
and	if	we	can	 s 	 witch 	 	to	 slide 	 s 	 	--	all	right	,	here	we	go	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	one	second	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	our	time	 do 	 ing 	 	,	is	just	making	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	can	keep	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	traffic	load	.
now	,	each	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 que 	 ries 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	life	and	tale	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	.
i	mean	,	it	could	be	 some 	 body 	 	's	health	,	it	could	be	 some 	 body 	 	's	 care 	 er 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	them	.
and	it	could	 potential 	 ly 	 	be	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	tomato	sauce	,	or	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 k 	 etch 	 up 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 que 	 ry 	 	that	we	had	--	i	guess	it	's	a	popular	band	that	was	more	popular	in	some	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	that	it	got	 start 	 ed 	 	right	here	.
in	the	u.s.	and	spain	,	it	was	popular	at	the	same	time	.
but	it	did	n't	have	 quit 	 e 	 	the	same	 pick 	 up 	 	in	the	u.s	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	did	in	spain	.
and	then	from	spain	,	it	went	to	italy	,	and	then	germany	got	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	right	now	the	u.k.	is	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	so	i	guess	the	u.s.	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	like	it	,	too	.
and	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	play	it	for	you	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	you	can	all	enjoy	it	for	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	 hope 	 fully 	 	that	search	will	work	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	part	of	--	you	know	,	part	of	what	we	want	to	do	to	grow	our	company	is	to	have	more	 search 	 es 	 	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	we	want	to	have	more	people	who	are	 health 	 y 	 	and	educated	.
more	 animal 	 s 	 	,	if	they	start	 do 	 ing 	 	 search 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	 part 	 ly 	 	,	we	want	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	and	so	one	thing	that	we	're	 embark 	 ing 	 	 up 	 on 	 	is	the	google	 found 	 ation 	 	,	and	we	're	in	the	process	of	setting	that	up	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	program	 al 	 ready 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	google	 grant 	 s 	 	that	now	 serve 	 s 	 	over	150	different	 char 	 ities 	 	around	the	world	,	and	these	are	some	of	the	 char 	 ities 	 	that	are	on	there	.
and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	part	of	.
in	fact	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	are	here	--	the	acumen	fund	,	i	think	approtec	we	have	running	,	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	if	that	one	's	up	yet	--	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	who	have	 present 	 ed 	 	here	are	running	through	google	 grant 	 s 	 	.
they	run	google	 ad 	 s 	 	,	and	we	just	give	them	the	ad	credit	so	they	can	let	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	know	.
one	of	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	 result 	 s 	 	that	we	got	--	we	have	a	singaporean	 business 	 man 	 	who	is	now	 sponsor 	 ing 	 	a	village	of	25	vietnamese	 girl 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	education	,	and	that	was	one	of	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	now	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	that	have	come	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	have	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 char 	 ities 	 	in	there	,	and	the	google	 found 	 ation 	 	will	be	an	even	 broad 	 er 	 	endeavor	.
now	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	know	who	 th 	 is 	 	is	?
a	-	ha	!
audience	:	orkut	.
sb	:	 y 	 es 	 	!	 some 	 body 	 	got	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	orkut	.	is	 any 	 body 	 	here	on	orkut	?
do	we	have	any	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	know	about	it	.
i	'll	explain	it	in	a	second	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	our	 engineer 	 s 	 	.
we	find	that	they	work	better	when	they	're	 sub 	 merge 	 d 	 	and	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	 leav 	 es 	 	.
that	's	how	we	churn	 t 	 hose 	 	 product 	 s 	 	out	.
orkut	had	a	vision	to	create	a	social	network	.
i	know	all	of	you	are	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	yet	 an 	 other 	 	social	network	.	``
but	it	was	a	dream	of	his	,	and	we	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	when	people	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	well	,	we	 general 	 ly 	 	let	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	he	built	.
we	just	released	it	in	a	test	phase	last	month	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	taking	off	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	vp	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	see	the	red	hair	,	and	i	do	n't	know	if	you	can	see	the	nose	ring	there	.
and	these	are	all	of	his	 friend 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	--	we	just	 deploy 	 ed 	 	it	--	we	just	 decide 	 d 	 	that	people	would	 s 	 end 	 	each	other	 invit 	 ations 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	service	,	and	so	we	just	had	the	people	in	our	company	 initi 	 ally 	 	 s 	 end 	 	them	out	.
and	now	we	've	grown	to	over	100,000	 member 	 s 	 	.
and	they	spread	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	even	 out 	 side 	 	the	u.s	.
you	can	see	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	u.s.	is	still	the	 major 	 ity 	 	here	--	 th 	 ough 	 	,	by	the	way	,	search	-	wise	,	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	30	percent	of	our	traffic	--	but	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	going	to	japan	,	and	the	u.k.	,	and	europe	,	and	all	the	rest	of	the	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	it	's	a	 f 	 un 	 	little	project	.
there	are	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	.	i	wo	n't	bore	you	with	these	.
but	it	's	just	the	kind	of	thing	that	we	just	try	out	for	 f 	 un 	 	and	see	where	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
and	--	well	,	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	in	suspense	.
larry	,	you	can	explain	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
larry	page	:	thank	you	,	sergey	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	--	both	sergey	and	i	went	to	a	montessori	school	,	and	i	think	,	for	some	reason	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 incorpo 	 rated 	 	in	google	.
and	sergey	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	orkut	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	you	know	,	orkut	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	in	his	time	,	and	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	--	at	google	,	we	've	 embodi 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	the	20	percent	time	,	``	and	the	idea	is	,	for	20	percent	of	your	time	,	if	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	at	google	,	you	can	do	what	you	think	is	the	best	thing	to	do	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	at	google	have	come	out	of	that	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	orkut	and	 al 	 so 	 	google	news	.
and	i	think	 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	world	 al 	 so 	 	have	come	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
mendel	,	who	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 teach 	 ing 	 	high	-	school	 student 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	,	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 genetic 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	hobby	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	come	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	news	,	which	i	just	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	was	 start 	 ed 	 	by	a	 research 	 er 	 	.
and	he	just	--	he	--	after	9/11	,	he	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	news	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	i	look	at	the	news	better	?	``
and	so	he	 start 	 ed 	 	 cluster 	 ing 	 	it	by	 categor 	 y 	 	,	and	then	he	 start 	 ed 	 	using	it	,	and	then	his	 friend 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	using	it	.
and	then	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	just	looking	cute	on	a	baby	's	bottom	,	we	made	it	a	googlette	,	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	small	project	at	google	.
so	it	'd	be	like	three	people	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	and	they	would	try	to	make	a	product	.
and	we	would	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 s 	 ure 	 	if	it	's	going	to	work	or	not	.
and	in	news	'	case	,	you	know	,	they	had	a	couple	of	people	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	for	a	while	,	and	then	more	and	more	people	 start 	 ed 	 	using	it	,	and	then	we	put	it	out	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	and	more	and	more	people	 start 	 ed 	 	using	it	.
and	now	it	's	a	real	,	full	-	blown	project	with	more	people	on	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	keep	our	 innov 	 ation 	 	running	.
i	think	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	get	 big 	 ger 	 	,	they	find	it	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	have	small	,	 innov 	 ative 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
and	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	too	,	for	a	while	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	a	new	 con 	 cept 	 	.	``
you	know	,	the	googlettes	--	that	's	a	small	project	that	we	're	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	if	it	's	going	to	work	or	not	,	but	we	hope	it	will	,	and	if	we	do	 en 	 ough 	 	of	them	,	some	of	them	will	 re 	 ally 	 	work	and	turn	out	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	news	.
but	then	we	had	a	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	then	we	had	over	100	 project 	 s 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	know	about	all	of	you	,	but	i	have	trouble	 keep 	 ing 	 	100	 thing 	 s 	 	in	my	head	at	once	.
and	we	found	that	if	we	just	wrote	all	of	them	down	and	 order 	 ed 	 	them	--	and	these	are	kind	of	made	up	.
do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	pay	attention	to	them	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	``	buy	iceland	``	was	from	a	media	article	.
we	would	never	do	 s 	 uch 	 	a	crazy	thing	,	but	--	in	any	case	,	we	found	if	we	just	 bas 	 ically 	 	wrote	them	all	down	and	 order 	 ed 	 	them	,	that	most	people	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	agree	what	the	 order 	 ing 	 	should	be	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	kind	of	a	surprise	to	me	,	but	we	found	that	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	keep	the	100	 thing 	 s 	 	in	your	head	,	which	you	did	by	writing	them	down	,	that	you	could	do	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	job	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	what	to	do	and	where	to	put	your	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	so	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	since	we	 institute 	 d 	 	that	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	i	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	be	 innov 	 ative 	 	and	still	stay	 reason 	 ably 	 	well	-	 organize 	 d 	 	.
the	other	thing	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	that	people	like	to	work	on	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	so	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	people	sort	of	 migr 	 ate 	 	to	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	high	 prior 	 ities 	 	.
i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 high 	 light 	 	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	new	,	or	you	might	not	know	about	.
and	the	top	thing	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	the	deskbar	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	use	the	google	 tool 	 bar 	 	?
raise	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	use	the	deskbar	?
all	right	,	see	?	you	 guy 	 s 	 	should	try	it	out	.
but	if	you	go	to	our	 s 	 ite 	 	and	search	for	``	deskbar	,	``	you	'll	get	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	idea	is	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	 tool 	 bar 	 	,	it	's	just	present	all	the	time	on	your	screen	on	the	bottom	,	and	you	can	do	 search 	 es 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
and	it	's	sort	of	like	a	better	version	of	the	 tool 	 bar 	 	.
thank	you	,	sergey	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	project	that	 some 	 body 	 	at	google	was	 re 	 ally 	 	passionate	about	,	and	they	just	,	they	got	going	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	a	great	product	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	taking	off	.
google	 answer 	 s 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	,	which	lets	you	--	for	five	to	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	you	can	type	a	question	in	,	and	then	there	's	a	pool	of	 research 	 ers 	 	that	go	out	and	research	it	for	you	,	and	it	's	 guarantee 	 d 	 	and	all	that	,	and	you	can	get	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 thing 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	all	that	time	 your 	 self 	 	.
froogle	lets	you	search	 shop 	 ping 	 	information	,	and	blogger	lets	you	publish	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	all	of	these	--	well	,	these	 we 	 re 	 	all	sort	of	 innov 	 ative 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	did	that	--	you	know	,	we	try	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	 thing 	 s 	 	in	our	company	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	in	our	physical	space	,	and	we	 notice 	 d 	 	in	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	you	have	to	wait	a	long	time	for	 project 	 ors 	 	to	turn	on	and	off	,	and	they	're	noisy	,	so	people	shut	them	off	.
and	we	did	n't	like	that	,	so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	 may 	 be 	 	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	,	we	built	these	little	 en 	 closure 	 s 	 	that	 en 	 closed 	 	the	 project 	 ors 	 	,	and	so	we	can	 leav 	 e 	 	them	on	all	the	time	and	they	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	silent	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	build	some	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	 al 	 so 	 	lets	us	manage	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	so	when	you	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	room	now	,	it	 list 	 s 	 	all	the	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	take	 note 	 s 	 	,	and	they	just	get	 email 	 ed 	 	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	to	all	the	people	that	 we 	 re 	 	present	in	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 be 	 come 	 	more	of	a	global	company	,	we	find	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	affect	us	--	you	know	,	can	we	work	 effective 	 ly 	 	with	people	who	are	n't	in	the	room	?
and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.	and	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	can	 re 	 ally 	 	make	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	lot	of	 engineer 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 laundr 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	they	should	.
and	so	we	found	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	to	have	 laundr 	 y 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	for	our	 young 	 er 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	and	...
we	 al 	 so 	 	allow	 dog 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	and	we	've	had	,	i	think	,	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 un 	 	culture	at	our	company	,	which	 help 	 s 	 	people	work	and	enjoy	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	our	``	cult	picture	.	``
i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
we	had	 th 	 is 	 	on	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	for	a	while	,	but	we	found	that	after	we	put	it	on	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	we	did	n't	get	any	job	 application 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	every	year	we	've	taken	the	whole	company	on	a	ski	trip	.
a	lot	of	work	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	from	people	 know 	 ing 	 	each	other	,	and	 inform 	 ally 	 	.
and	i	think	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	good	job	 encourag 	 ing 	 	that	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	it	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 un 	 	place	to	work	.
 a 	 long 	 	with	our	 logo 	 s 	 	,	too	,	which	i	think	 re 	 ally 	 	 em 	 body 	 	our	culture	when	we	change	 thing 	 s 	 	.
in	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 advise 	 d 	 	we	should	never	change	our	logo	 be 	 cause 	 	we	should	establish	our	brand	,	you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	you	'd	never	want	to	change	your	logo	.
you	want	it	to	be	 consist 	 ent 	 	.
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sound	so	much	 f 	 un 	 	.
why	do	n't	we	try	changing	it	every	day	?	``
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 es 	 	me	about	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	now	is	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	adsense	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	bit	 fore 	 shadow 	 ing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	before	dean	 drop 	 ped 	 	out	.
but	the	idea	is	,	like	,	on	a	 news 	 paper 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	show	you	relevant	 ad 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	hard	to	read	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	 say 	 s 	 	``	battle	for	new	hampshire	:	howard	dean	for	 p 	 resident 	 	``	--	 article 	 s 	 	on	howard	dean	.
and	these	 ad 	 s 	 	are	generated	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	--	like	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	on	the	washington	post	--	from	the	content	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	so	we	use	our	over	150,000	 advertise 	 rs 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	 advertise 	 ments 	 	,	so	we	pick	the	one	that	's	most	relevant	to	what	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	at	,	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	on	search	.
so	the	idea	is	we	can	make	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	,	not	just	 annoy 	 ing 	 	,	right	?
and	the	nice	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	have	a	self	-	serve	program	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	have	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	let	's	them	 re 	 ally 	 	make	money	.	and	i	--	you	know	,	there	's	a	number	of	people	i	met	--	i	met	 th 	 is 	 	guy	who	 run 	 s 	 	a	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	at	a	party	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	was	n't	making	any	money	.
i	just	put	 th 	 is 	 	thing	on	my	 s 	 ite 	 	and	i	'm	making	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	.
and	,	you	know	,	thank	you	.
i	do	n't	have	to	do	my	other	job	now	.	``
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	work	better	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	content	get	better	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	 search 	 ing 	 	work	better	,	when	people	can	 re 	 ally 	 	make	 the 	 ir 	 	livelihood	from	producing	great	content	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	session	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	about	the	future	,	so	i	'd	thought	i	'd	talk	at	 l 	 east 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	about	it	.
and	the	idea	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	do	the	perfect	job	 do 	 ing 	 	search	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	be	smart	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	type	,	you	know	,	any	kind	of	thing	 in 	 to 	 	google	,	and	you	expect	an	answer	back	,	right	?
but	 find 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	 trick 	 y 	 	,	and	so	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	the	ultimate	search	engine	would	be	smart	.
it	would	be	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
and	so	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	work	on	,	and	we	even	have	some	people	who	are	 excit 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	and	crazy	 en 	 ough 	 	to	work	on	it	now	,	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	goal	.
so	we	 al 	 ways 	 	hope	that	google	will	be	smart	,	but	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	when	other	people	think	that	it	is	.
and	so	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	a	funny	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	blog	from	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	and	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	,	but	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	,	sergey	,	you	can	 high 	 light 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 high 	 light 	 	's	right	there	.	oh	,	thank	you	.
so	,	``	related	 search 	 es 	 	,	``	right	there	.	you	ca	n't	see	it	that	well	,	but	we	 decide 	 d 	 	we	should	put	in	 th 	 is 	 	feature	 in 	 to 	 	our	adsense	 ad 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	related	 search 	 es 	 	.	``
and	so	we	'd	say	,	you	know	,	``	did	you	mean	'	search	for	'	``	--	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	``	saddam	hussein	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	blog	is	about	 ir 	 aq 	 	--	and	you	know	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	the	 ad 	 s 	 	,	and	we	thought	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	great	idea	.
and	so	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	blog	of	a	young	person	who	was	kind	of	 depress 	 ed 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	'm	 sleep 	 ing 	 	a	lot	.	``
he	was	just	kind	of	writing	about	his	life	.
and	our	 algorithm 	 s 	 	--	not	a	person	,	of	course	,	but	our	 algorithm 	 s 	 	,	our	 computer 	 s 	 	--	read	his	blog	and	 decide 	 d 	 	that	the	related	search	was	,	``	i	am	 bor 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	he	read	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	he	thought	a	person	had	 decide 	 d 	 	that	he	was	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 fortunate 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	what	are	these	,	you	know	,	 bastard 	 s 	 	at	google	 do 	 ing 	 	?
why	do	n't	they	like	my	blog	?	``
and	so	then	we	read	his	blog	,	which	was	 get 	 ting 	 	--	you	know	,	sort	of	going	from	bad	to	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	the	related	search	was	,	``	 retard 	 s 	 	.	``
and	then	,	you	know	,	he	got	even	more	mad	,	and	he	wrote	--	like	,	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 wear 	 ing 	 	and	so	on	.
and	then	we	 produce 	 d 	 	``	you	suck	.	``
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	it	 end 	 ed 	 	with	``	kiss	my	ass	.	``
and	so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	he	thought	he	was	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	smart	,	and	of	course	,	you	know	,	we	just	sort	of	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	program	and	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	out	,	and	it	did	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	work	,	and	we	do	n't	have	 th 	 is 	 	feature	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	with	that	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	can	 s 	 witch 	 	back	to	the	world	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	end	just	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	there	's	a	couple	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	make	me	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	with	google	,	and	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	is	that	we	're	able	to	make	money	 large 	 ly 	 	through	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	and	one	of	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	that	i	did	n't	expect	from	that	was	that	we	're	able	to	serve	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	world	 with 	 out 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	,	you	know	,	 place 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	have	 a 	 s 	 	much	money	.
so	we	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	our	 product 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	for	less	money	in	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	poor	,	and	then	they	get	re	-	 import 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	u.s.	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	with	the	drug	industry	.
and	i	think	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	have	that	kind	of	business	model	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	access	to	our	search	,	and	i	think	that	's	a	tremendous	,	tremendous	benefit	.
the	other	thing	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	just	 brief 	 ly 	 	is	that	we	have	a	tremendous	ability	and	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	provide	people	the	right	information	,	and	we	view	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	like	a	 news 	 paper 	 	or	a	magazine	--	that	we	should	provide	 ver 	 y 	 	 object 	 ive 	 	information	.
and	so	in	our	search	 result 	 s 	 	,	we	never	accept	payment	for	our	search	 result 	 s 	 	.
we	accept	payment	for	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	mark	it	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	.
and	that	's	 un 	 like 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 competitor 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	 decision 	 s 	 	we	're	able	to	make	like	that	have	a	tremendous	impact	on	the	world	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	 re 	 ally 	 	proud	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	with	google	.
so	thank	you	.
