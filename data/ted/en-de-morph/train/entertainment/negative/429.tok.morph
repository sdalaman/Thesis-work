 man 	 y 	 	of	you	could	ask	the	question	,	you	know	,	why	is	a	 fly 	 ing 	 	car	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	more	 accurate 	 ly 	 	,	a	 road 	 able 	 	 air 	 craft 	 	,	possible	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	?
a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	mr.	ford	 predict 	 ed 	 	that	 fly 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	of	some	form	would	be	 avail 	 able 	 	.
now	,	60	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	why	it	's	possible	.
when	i	was	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	--	about	a	year	after	mr.	ford	made	his	 predict 	 ions 	 	,	i	was	living	in	a	 r 	 ural 	 	part	of	canada	,	on	the	side	of	a	mountain	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	area	.
 get 	 ting 	 	to	school	,	for	a	kid	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	short	for	his	age	,	through	the	canadian	winter	,	was	not	a	 pleas 	 ant 	 	experience	.
it	was	a	 try 	 ing 	 	and	 scar 	 y 	 	thing	for	a	young	kid	to	be	going	through	.
at	the	end	of	my	first	year	in	school	,	in	the	summer	of	that	year	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	a	couple	 humming 	 bird 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	caught	in	a	shed	near	my	home	.
they	'd	worn	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	out	,	 beat 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	against	the	window	,	and	,	well	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	easy	to	capture	.
i	took	them	 out 	 side 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	let	them	go	,	that	split	second	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 tire 	 d 	 	,	that	second	i	let	them	go	they	 hover 	 ed 	 	for	a	second	,	then	 zip 	 ped 	 	off	 in 	 to 	 	the	distance	.
i	thought	,	what	a	great	way	to	get	to	school	.
for	a	kid	at	that	age	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	like	infinite	speed	,	 disappear 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	inspired	by	that	.
and	so	the	next	--	over	the	next	six	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	i	've	built	a	number	of	 air 	 craft 	 	,	with	the	goal	of	creating	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	do	for	you	,	or	me	,	what	the	 humming 	 bird 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	and	give	you	that	 flex 	 ibility 	 	.
i	've	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	vehicle	,	 generic 	 ally 	 	,	a	 vol 	 ant 	 or 	 	,	after	the	latin	word	``	 vol 	 ant 	 	,	``	meaning	,	to	fly	in	a	light	,	nimble	manner	.
 vol 	 ant 	 or 	 	-	like	helicopter	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	.
the	faa	,	the	 controll 	 ing 	 	body	above	all	,	 call 	 s 	 	it	a	``	powered	lift	 air 	 craft 	 	.	``
and	they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 issue 	 d 	 	a	pilot	's	 licens 	 e 	 	--	a	 power 	 lift 	 	pilot	's	 licens 	 e 	 	--	for	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	 air 	 craft 	 	.
it	's	 close 	 r 	 	than	you	think	.	it	's	kind	of	 remark 	 able 	 	when	you	consider	that	there	are	no	 operation 	 al 	 	powered	lift	 air 	 craft 	 	.
so	for	once	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	the	government	is	 a 	 head 	 	of	 it 	 self 	 	.
the	press	 call 	 s 	 	my	 part 	 icular 	 	 vol 	 ant 	 or 	 	a	``	skycar	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	bit	 ear 	 lier 	 	version	of	it	,	that	's	why	it	's	 give 	 n 	 	the	x	 design 	 ation 	 	,	but	it	's	a	four	-	passenger	 air 	 craft 	 	that	could	take	off	 vert 	 ically 	 	,	like	a	helicopter	--	 there 	 fore 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	an	 air 	 field 	 	.
on	the	ground	,	it	's	powered	 electric 	 ally 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 class 	 ified 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 motor 	 cycle 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	three	 wheel 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	great	asset	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	,	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	,	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	 high 	 ways 	 	in	most	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	all	cities	.
so	that	's	an	asset	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	've	got	to	deal	with	the	crash	 protect 	 ion 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	of	the	 auto 	 mobile 	 	,	forget	it	--	you	're	never	going	to	fly	it	.
one	could	say	that	a	helicopter	 do 	 es 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	what	the	 humming 	 bird 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	and	 get 	 s 	 	around	in	much	the	same	way	,	and	it	's	true	,	but	a	helicopter	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	 de 	 vice 	 	.
it	's	expensive	--	so	expensive	that	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	could	own	or	use	it	.
it	's	often	 be 	 en 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	fragile	nature	and	 it 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 part 	 s 	 	--	a	large	number	of	 part 	 s 	 	--	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	 form 	 ation 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	i	have	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	personal	,	 an 	 other 	 	great	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	helicopter	and	the	 vol 	 ant 	 or 	 	--	in	my	case	the	skycar	 vol 	 ant 	 or 	 	--	is	the	experience	that	i	've	had	in	 fly 	 ing 	 	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
in	a	helicopter	you	feel	--	and	it	's	still	a	 remark 	 able 	 	 sens 	 ation 	 	--	you	feel	like	you	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 haul 	 ed 	 	up	from	above	by	a	 vib 	 rating 	 	 cr 	 ane 	 	.
when	you	get	in	the	skycar	--	and	i	can	tell	you	,	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	other	person	that	's	 flow 	 n 	 	it	,	but	he	had	the	same	 sens 	 ation 	 	--	you	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	like	you	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 lift 	 ed 	 	up	by	a	magic	carpet	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	vibration	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.	the	 sens 	 ation 	 	is	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	great	 motiv 	 ator 	 	.
i	 on 	 ly 	 	get	to	fly	 th 	 is 	 	vehicle	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	when	i	can	 persuad 	 e 	 	my	 stock 	 holder 	 s 	 	to	let	me	do	so	,	but	it	's	still	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	that	reward	you	for	all	that	time	.
what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	is	 some 	 thing 	 	to	replace	the	 auto 	 mobile 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	50	-	plus	mile	 trip 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	 real 	 ize 	 	that	50	mile	-	plus	 trip 	 s 	 	make	up	85	percent	of	the	 mile 	 s 	 	 travel 	 ed 	 	in	america	.
if	we	can	get	rid	of	that	,	then	the	 high 	 ways 	 	will	now	be	 use 	 ful 	 	to	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	 contrast 	 ed 	 	by	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	next	slide	,	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 s 	 een 	 	in	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	i	give	you	a	perfect	skycar	,	the	perfect	vehicle	for	use	,	it	's	going	to	have	 ver 	 y 	 	little	value	to	you	 un 	 less 	 	you	've	got	a	system	to	use	it	in	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	any	of	you	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	are	there	great	 thing 	 s 	 	up	there	--	what	am	i	going	to	do	,	get	up	there	?
it	's	bad	 en 	 ough 	 	on	a	 high 	 way 	 	,	what	's	it	going	to	be	like	to	be	in	the	air	?
 th 	 is 	 	world	that	you	're	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	is	going	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 integrate 	 d 	 	.	you	're	not	going	to	be	a	pilot	,	you	're	going	to	be	a	passenger	.
and	it	's	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 determine 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	process	 go 	 es 	 	forward	.
i	can	tell	you	,	 technical 	 ly 	 	we	can	build	skycars	--	my	god	,	we	went	to	the	moon	!
the	technology	there	was	much	more	difficult	than	what	i	'm	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	here	.
but	we	have	to	have	these	 prior 	 ity 	 	 change 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	have	 infra 	 structure 	 	to	go	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
 historic 	 ally 	 	you	see	that	we	got	around	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	by	 can 	 al 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	that	system	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	by	 rail 	 road 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	that	 disappear 	 ed 	 	we	came	in	with	 high 	 ways 	 	.
but	if	you	look	at	that	top	corner	--	the	 high 	 way 	 	system	--	you	see	where	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.	 high 	 ways 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	built	,	and	that	's	a	fact	.	you	wo	n't	see	any	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 high 	 ways 	 	in	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	if	like	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	see	30	percent	more	traffic	.
and	where	is	that	going	to	lead	you	to	?
so	the	issue	then	,	i	've	often	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	is	when	is	it	going	to	happen	?
when	are	we	going	to	be	able	to	have	these	 vehicle 	 s 	 	?
and	of	course	,	if	you	ask	me	,	i	'm	going	to	give	you	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	view	.
after	all	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	60	 year 	 s 	 	here	 believ 	 ing 	 	it	's	going	to	happen	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	not	going	to	quote	 my 	 self 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'd	prefer	to	quote	 some 	 one 	 	else	,	who	 test 	 ified 	 	with	me	before	congress	,	and	in	his	position	 a 	 s 	 	head	of	nasa	put	forward	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	vision	of	the	future	of	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	 air 	 craft 	 	.
now	i	would	 argu 	 e 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	fact	that	on	the	 high 	 ways 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 ave 	 rag 	 ing 	 	about	30	 mile 	 s 	 	per	hour	--	on	average	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	dot	--	the	skycar	 travel 	 s 	 	at	over	300	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	up	to	25,000	feet	.
and	so	,	in	effect	,	you	could	see	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	 ten 	 fold 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	ability	to	get	around	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	speed	is	 concern 	 ed 	 	.
 un 	 beknownst 	 	to	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	the	 high 	 way 	 	in	the	sky	that	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	under	construction	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	use	of	the	gps	--	you	're	familiar	with	gps	in	your	 auto 	 mobile 	 	,	but	you	may	not	be	familiar	with	the	fact	that	there	's	a	gps	u.s.	,	there	's	a	russian	gps	,	and	there	's	a	new	gps	system	going	to	europe	,	 call 	 ed 	 	galileo	.
with	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 system 	 s 	 	,	you	have	what	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	--	a	level	of	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ancy 	 	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	if	one	system	 fail 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	still	have	a	way	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	you	're	 be 	 ing 	 	controlled	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	're	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	where	 computer 	 s 	 	are	 controll 	 ing 	 	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	critical	that	 some 	 thing 	 	ca	n't	fail	on	you	.
how	would	a	trip	in	a	skycar	work	?
well	,	you	ca	n't	right	now	take	off	from	your	home	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	too	noisy	.
i	mean	to	be	able	to	take	off	from	your	home	,	you	'd	have	to	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	quiet	.
but	it	's	still	 fair 	 ly 	 	quiet	.
you	'd	motor	,	 electric 	 ally 	 	,	to	a	 vert 	 i 	 port 	 	,	which	may	be	a	few	 block 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	a	few	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	a	 road 	 able 	 	 air 	 craft 	 	,	and	you	're	not	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	that	much	time	on	the	road	.
after	all	,	if	you	can	fly	like	that	,	why	are	you	going	to	drive	around	on	a	 high 	 way 	 	?
go	to	a	local	 vert 	 i 	 port 	 	,	plug	in	your	destination	,	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	passenger	.
you	can	play	computer	 game 	 s 	 	,	you	can	sleep	,	you	can	read	on	the	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	--	there	wo	n't	be	you	 a 	 s 	 	a	pilot	.	and	i	know	the	 pilot 	 s 	 	in	the	audience	are	n't	going	to	like	that	--	and	i	've	had	a	lot	of	bad	 feed 	 back 	 	from	people	who	want	to	be	up	there	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	and	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	that	.
and	of	course	,	i	suppose	like	 re 	 creation 	 al 	 	 park 	 s 	 	you	can	still	do	that	.
but	the	vehicle	 it 	 self 	 	is	going	to	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	controlled	environment	.
or	it	's	going	to	have	no	use	to	you	 a 	 s 	 	a	person	who	might	use	 s 	 uch 	 	a	system	.
we	flew	the	first	vehicle	for	the	 inter 	 national 	 	press	in	1965	,	when	i	 re 	 ally 	 	got	it	 start 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	a	professor	at	the	u.c	.	davis	system	,	and	i	got	a	lot	of	 excit 	 ement 	 	around	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	was	able	to	fund	the	 initi 	 ation 	 	of	the	program	back	in	that	time	.
and	then	through	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 year 	 s 	 	we	 invent 	 ed 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	the	critical	point	was	in	1989	,	when	we	 demonst 	 rated 	 	the	 st 	 ability 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	vehicle	--	how	 complete 	 ly 	 	 s 	 table 	 	it	was	in	all	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	which	is	of	course	 ver 	 y 	 	critical	.
still	not	a	practical	vehicle	 dur 	 ing 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	moving	in	the	right	direction	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	early	part	of	--	or	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	middle	of	2002	,	we	flew	the	400	--	m	400	,	which	was	the	four	-	passenger	vehicle	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	here	,	we	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	it	 remote 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ways 	 	did	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
and	we	had	 ver 	 y 	 	small	power	 plant 	 s 	 	in	it	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
we	are	now	 install 	 ing 	 	 large 	 r 	 	 power 	 plant 	 s 	 	,	which	will	make	it	possible	for	me	to	get	back	on	board	.
a	 vert 	 ical 	 	-	 take 	 off 	 	 air 	 craft 	 	is	not	the	 safe 	 st 	 	vehicle	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	test	flight	program	.
there	's	an	old	 ad 	 age 	 	that	 appli 	 ed 	 	for	the	 year 	 s 	 	between	1950s	and	1970s	,	when	every	 aeronautic 	 al 	 	company	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 vert 	 ical 	 	-	 take 	 off 	 	 air 	 craft 	 	.
a	 vert 	 ical 	 	-	 take 	 off 	 	 air 	 craft 	 	 need 	 s 	 	an	artificial	 stabil 	 ization 	 	system	--	that	's	essential	.

and	the	 ad 	 age 	 	that	i	'm	 refer 	 ring 	 	to	,	that	 appli 	 ed 	 	at	that	time	,	was	that	 noth 	 ing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	down	 fast 	 er 	 	than	a	vtol	 air 	 craft 	 	 up 	 side 	 	down	.
that	's	a	 ma 	 cab 	 re 	 	comment	 be 	 cause 	 	we	lost	a	lot	of	 pilot 	 s 	 	.

we	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	175	 horse 	 power 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	cubic	foot	.
we	have	eight	 engine 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	vehicle	.
we	have	four	 computer 	 s 	 	.	we	have	two	 parachut 	 es 	 	.
 red 	 un 	 d 	 ancy 	 	is	the	critical	issue	here	.
if	you	want	to	stay	 al 	 ive 	 	you	've	got	to	have	 back 	 up 	 s 	 	.
and	we	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 flow 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	vehicle	and	lost	an	engine	,	and	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	hover	.
the	 computer 	 s 	 	back	up	each	other	.	there	's	a	 vot 	 ing 	 	system	--	if	one	computer	is	not	 agree 	 ing 	 	with	the	other	three	,	it	's	 kick 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	system	.
and	then	you	have	three	--	you	still	have	the	triple	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ancy 	 	.
if	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 fail 	 s 	 	,	you	still	have	a	second	chance	.
if	you	stick	around	,	then	good	luck	.
there	wo	n't	be	a	third	chance	.
the	 parachut 	 es 	 	are	there	--	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	more	for	 psycho 	 logical 	 	than	real	 reason 	 s 	 	,	but	they	will	be	an	ultimate	 back 	 up 	 	if	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	that	.
i	'd	like	to	show	you	an	 anim 	 ation 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	next	one	,	which	is	one	element	of	the	skycar	's	use	,	but	it	's	one	that	 demonst 	 rates 	 	how	it	could	be	used	.
you	could	think	of	it	 personal 	 ly 	 	in	your	own	 term 	 s 	 	,	of	how	you	might	use	it	.

paul	moller	:	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	personal	 transport 	 ation 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	skycar	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	 vol 	 ant 	 or 	 	form	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	will	be	a	significant	part	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	dr.	goldin	 say 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	going	to	change	the	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	way	.
if	you	can	live	75	 mile 	 s 	 	from	san	francisco	and	get	there	in	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	to	sell	your	700,000	-	dollar	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	,	buy	an	 up 	 scale 	 	home	on	the	side	of	a	mountain	,	buy	a	skycar	,	which	i	think	would	be	priced	at	that	time	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	in	the	area	of	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	put	money	in	the	bank	...
that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	incentive	for	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	san	francisco	.
but	you	better	be	the	first	one	out	of	town	 a 	 s 	 	the	real	 e 	 state 	 	 value 	 s 	 	go	to	hell	.
 develop 	 ing 	 	the	skycar	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	real	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	i	'm	dependent	on	a	lot	of	other	people	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	--	both	 financial 	 ly 	 	and	in	technical	help	.
and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	--	you	run	 in 	 to 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	great	 accept 	 ance 	 	of	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	a	lot	of	 reject 	 ion 	 	of	the	same	kind	of	thing	.

there	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	poll	that	came	out	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	under	nas	--	i	think	it	's	msnbc	--	in	which	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	,	``	are	you	in	the	market	for	a	 vol 	 ant 	 or 	 	?	``
twenty	-	three	percent	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.	``

 on 	 ly 	 	seven	percent	 s 	 aid 	 	that	they	would	n't	consider	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	skycar	.
i	'm	 encourag 	 ed 	 	by	that	.	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	feel	like	,	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	it	is	 be 	 coming 	 	self	-	evident	.
