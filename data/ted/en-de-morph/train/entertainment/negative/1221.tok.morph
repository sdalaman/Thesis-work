now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	un	-	ted	-	like	thing	to	do	,	but	let	's	kick	off	the	afternoon	with	a	 mess 	 age 	 	from	a	 myster 	 y 	 	sponsor	.
 anonym 	 ous 	 	:	dear	fox	news	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	come	to	our	 un 	 fortunate 	 	attention	that	both	the	name	and	nature	of	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ravage 	 d 	 	.
we	are	 every 	 one 	 	.	we	are	no	one	.
we	are	 anonym 	 ous 	 	.	we	are	 leg 	 ion 	 	.
we	do	not	forgive	.	we	do	not	forget	.
we	are	but	the	base	of	 cha 	 os 	 	.
misha	glenny	:	 anonym 	 ous 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	--	a	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	group	of	 politic 	 ally 	 	 motiv 	 ated 	 	 hack 	 ers 	 	who	have	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	2011	.
and	they	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	.
you	never	know	when	they	're	going	to	attack	next	,	who	or	what	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	will	be	.
but	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	they	have	a	sense	of	humor	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	 hack 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	fox	news	'	twitter	account	to	announce	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	's	 assassin 	 ation 	 	.
now	you	can	imagine	the	panic	that	would	have	generated	in	the	 news 	 room 	 	at	fox	.
``	what	do	we	do	now	?
put	on	a	black	 arm 	 band 	 	,	or	crack	open	the	 champ 	 agne 	 	?	``
and	of	course	,	who	could	 es 	 cape 	 	the	 iron 	 y 	 	of	a	member	of	rupert	murdoch	's	news	corp	.
 be 	 ing 	 	a	victim	of	 hack 	 ing 	 	for	a	change	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	turn	on	the	news	and	you	say	,	``	is	there	 any 	 one 	 	left	to	hack	?	``
sony	playstation	network	--	 d 	 one 	 	,	the	government	of	 tur 	 key 	 	--	tick	,	britain	's	serious	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	 age 	 ncy 	 	--	a	breeze	,	the	cia	--	 fall 	 ing 	 	off	a	log	.
in	fact	,	a	friend	of	mine	from	the	security	industry	told	me	the	other	day	that	there	are	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	the	world	:	 t 	 hose 	 	that	know	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hack 	 ed 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	that	do	n't	.
i	mean	three	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 cyber 	 security 	 	 service 	 s 	 	to	the	fbi	have	 be 	 en 	 	 hack 	 ed 	 	.
is	 noth 	 ing 	 	sacred	 any 	 more 	 	,	for	heaven	's	sake	?
 any 	 way 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	group	 anonym 	 ous 	 	--	and	they	would	say	 th 	 is 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	they	are	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	a	service	by	 demonst 	 rating 	 	how	 use 	 less 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	at	 protect 	 ing 	 	our	data	.
but	there	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	 a 	 spect 	 	to	 anonym 	 ous 	 	--	they	are	 ideo 	 logically 	 	driven	.
they	claim	that	they	are	 batt 	 ling 	 	a	 da 	 star 	 d 	 ly 	 	 conspi 	 racy 	 	.
they	say	that	 government 	 s 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	over	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	control	it	,	and	that	they	,	 anonym 	 ous 	 	,	are	the	authentic	voice	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	--	be	it	against	middle	eastern	 dictator 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	against	global	media	 corporation 	 s 	 	,	or	against	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 age 	 ncies 	 	,	or	 who 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	are	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	 un 	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	they	're	a	little	 inch 	 o 	 ate 	 	.
there	's	a	strong	whiff	of	half	-	 bake 	 d 	 	 anarch 	 ism 	 	about	them	.
but	one	thing	is	true	:	we	are	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	a	 might 	 y 	 	struggle	for	control	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
the	web	 link 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	it	will	mediate	most	human	activity	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 fashion 	 ed 	 	a	new	and	 complic 	 ated 	 	environment	for	an	old	-	age	dilemma	that	 pit 	 s 	 	the	 demand 	 s 	 	of	security	with	the	 desir 	 e 	 	for	 free 	 dom 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	struggle	.
and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	for	 mortal 	 s 	 	like	you	and	me	,	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	ca	n't	understand	it	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	in	an	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	attack	of	 hub 	 ris 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	would	try	and	do	that	.
and	i	sort	of	get	it	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	was	looking	at	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	it	.
but	in	order	to	try	and	explain	the	whole	thing	,	i	would	need	 an 	 other 	 	18	 minute 	 s 	 	or	so	to	do	it	,	so	you	're	just	going	to	have	to	take	it	on	trust	from	me	on	 th 	 is 	 	occasion	,	and	let	me	assure	you	that	all	of	these	 issue 	 s 	 	are	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 cyber 	 security 	 	and	control	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	one	way	or	the	other	,	but	in	a	 configu 	 ration 	 	that	even	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	 difficult 	 y 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	his	head	around	.
so	there	you	are	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	,	in	the	middle	,	there	is	our	old	friend	,	the	 hack 	 er 	 	.
the	 hack 	 er 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	central	to	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	,	social	and	economic	 issue 	 s 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	the	net	.
and	so	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	well	,	these	are	the	 guy 	 s 	 	who	i	want	to	talk	to	.	``
and	what	do	you	know	,	 no 	 body 	 	else	 do 	 es 	 	talk	to	the	 hack 	 ers 	 	.
they	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	 anonym 	 ous 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	.
so	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	we	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	pour	 billion 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 cyber 	 security 	 	--	for	the	most	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	technical	 solution 	 s 	 	--	no	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	talk	to	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	the	 hack 	 ers 	 	,	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	prefer	these	 re 	 ally 	 	 dazzl 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	,	which	cost	a	huge	amount	of	money	.
and	so	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	 hack 	 ers 	 	.
well	,	i	say	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	is	one	 teen 	 y 	 	weeny	little	research	unit	in	turin	,	italy	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 hack 	 ers 	 	 pro 	 filing 	 	project	.
and	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	some	fantastic	research	 in 	 to 	 	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	abilities	and	the	 social 	 ization 	 	of	 hack 	 ers 	 	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	a	u.n.	operation	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	why	 government 	 s 	 	and	 corporation 	 s 	 	are	not	that	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	them	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	u.n.	operation	,	of	course	,	it	 lack 	 s 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	.
but	i	think	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	work	.
 be 	 cause 	 	where	we	have	a	 sur 	 plus 	 	of	technology	in	the	 cyber 	 security 	 	industry	,	we	have	a	definite	lack	of	--	call	me	old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	--	human	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
now	,	so	far	i	've	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	the	 hack 	 ers 	 	 anonym 	 ous 	 	who	are	a	 politic 	 ally 	 	 motiv 	 ated 	 	 hack 	 ing 	 	group	.
of	course	,	the	criminal	justice	system	 treat 	 s 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	common	old	garden	 criminal 	 s 	 	.
but	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	make	use	of	 it 	 s 	 	 hack 	 ed 	 	information	for	financial	gain	.
but	what	about	the	real	 cyber 	 criminal 	 s 	 	?
well	real	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 go 	 es 	 	back	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	when	a	group	of	 gift 	 ed 	 	ukrainian	 hack 	 ers 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	which	led	to	the	 industrial 	 ization 	 	of	 cyber 	 crime 	 	.
welcome	to	the	now	 for 	 gotten 	 	realm	of	carderplanet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	decade	ago	on	the	net	.
now	carderplanet	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 cyber 	 criminal 	 s 	 	would	go	there	to	buy	and	sell	 stole 	 n 	 	credit	card	 detail 	 s 	 	,	to	 ex 	 change 	 	information	about	new	 mal 	 ware 	 	that	was	out	there	.
and	remember	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	time	when	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	for	the	first	time	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	off	-	the	-	shelf	 mal 	 ware 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	ready	for	use	,	out	-	of	-	the	-	box	stuff	,	which	you	can	deploy	even	if	you	're	not	a	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 hack 	 er 	 	.
and	so	carderplanet	 be 	 came 	 	a	sort	of	 super 	 market 	 	for	 cyber 	 criminal 	 s 	 	.
and	 it 	 s 	 	 creator 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	smart	and	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 face 	 d 	 	with	one	enormous	 challeng 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 cyber 	 criminal 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	:	how	do	you	do	business	,	how	do	you	trust	 some 	 body 	 	on	the	web	who	you	want	to	do	business	with	when	you	know	that	they	're	a	criminal	?
it	's	 axiom 	 atic 	 	that	they	're	dodgy	,	and	they	're	going	to	want	to	try	and	rip	you	off	.
so	the	family	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	inner	core	of	carderplanet	was	known	,	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	idea	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 es 	 crow 	 	system	.
they	 ap 	 point 	 ed 	 	an	officer	who	would	mediate	between	the	 vend 	 or 	 	and	the	 purchase 	 r 	 	.
the	 vend 	 or 	 	,	say	,	had	 stole 	 n 	 	credit	card	 detail 	 s 	 	;	the	 purchase 	 r 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	a	hold	of	them	.
the	 purchase 	 r 	 	would	 s 	 end 	 	the	 administr 	 ative 	 	officer	some	 dollar 	 s 	 	 digital 	 ly 	 	,	and	the	 vend 	 or 	 	would	sell	the	 stole 	 n 	 	credit	card	 detail 	 s 	 	.
and	the	officer	would	then	 ver 	 ify 	 	if	the	 stole 	 n 	 	credit	card	 work 	 ed 	 	.
and	if	they	did	,	he	then	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	the	money	to	the	 vend 	 or 	 	and	the	 stole 	 n 	 	credit	card	 detail 	 s 	 	to	the	 purchase 	 r 	 	.
and	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	which	 complete 	 ly 	 	 revolution 	 ized 	 	 cyber 	 crime 	 	on	the	web	.
and	after	that	,	it	just	went	wild	.
we	had	a	 champ 	 agne 	 	decade	for	people	who	we	know	 a 	 s 	 	carders	.
now	i	spoke	to	one	of	these	carders	who	we	'll	call	redbrigade	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	that	was	n't	even	his	proper	 nick 	 name 	 	--	but	i	 promise 	 d 	 	i	would	n't	reveal	who	he	was	.
and	he	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	me	how	in	2003	and	2004	he	would	go	on	 spree 	 s 	 	in	new	york	,	taking	out	$	10,000	from	an	atm	here	,	$	30,000	from	an	atm	there	,	using	 clon 	 ed 	 	credit	 card 	 s 	 	.
he	was	making	,	on	average	a	week	,	$	150,000	--	tax	free	of	course	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	had	so	much	money	 s 	 ta 	 shed 	 	in	his	upper	-	east	side	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	at	one	point	that	he	just	did	n't	know	what	to	do	with	it	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	fell	 in 	 to 	 	a	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
but	that	's	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	story	,	which	i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	now	.
now	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	redbrigade	is	that	he	was	n't	an	 advance 	 d 	 	 hack 	 er 	 	.
he	sort	of	 under 	 stood 	 	the	technology	,	and	he	 real 	 ized 	 	that	security	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	a	carder	,	but	he	did	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	his	 day 	 s 	 	and	 night 	 s 	 	bent	over	a	computer	,	eating	pizza	,	 drink 	 ing 	 	 co 	 ke 	 	and	that	sort	of	thing	.
he	was	out	there	on	the	town	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	fab	time	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	high	life	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 hack 	 ers 	 	are	 on 	 ly 	 	one	element	in	a	 cyber 	 criminal 	 	enterprise	.
and	often	they	're	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	element	of	all	.
and	i	want	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	to	you	by	 introduc 	 ing 	 	you	to	six	 character 	 s 	 	who	i	met	while	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	research	.
dimitry	golubov	,	aka	script	--	born	in	odessa	,	ukraine	in	1982	.
now	he	 develop 	 ed 	 	his	social	and	moral	compass	on	the	black	sea	port	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	1990s	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	sink	-	or	-	swim	environment	where	 involve 	 ment 	 	in	criminal	or	corrupt	 activ 	 ities 	 	was	 entire 	 ly 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	computer	user	,	what	dimitry	did	was	to	transfer	the	 gang 	 ster 	 	 capital 	 ism 	 	of	his	 home 	 town 	 	onto	the	 world 	 wide 	 	web	.
and	he	did	a	great	job	in	it	.
you	have	to	understand	 th 	 ough 	 	that	from	his	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	 birth 	 day 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	environment	he	 k 	 new 	 	was	 gang 	 ster 	 ism 	 	.
he	 k 	 new 	 	no	other	way	of	making	a	living	and	making	money	.
then	we	have	renukanth	subramaniam	,	aka	jilsi	--	founder	of	darkmarket	,	born	in	colombo	,	sri	lanka	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	eight	year	-	old	,	he	and	his	 parent 	 s 	 	 fl 	 ed 	 	the	sri	lankan	capital	 be 	 cause 	 	singhalese	 mob 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 roam 	 ing 	 	the	city	,	looking	for	tamils	like	renu	to	murder	.
at	11	,	he	was	 interrog 	 ated 	 	by	the	sri	lankan	 militar 	 y 	 	,	 accus 	 ed 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	terrorist	,	and	his	 parent 	 s 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	him	on	his	own	to	britain	 a 	 s 	 	a	 refuge 	 e 	 	seeking	 politic 	 al 	 	asylum	.

he	was	 convict 	 ed 	 	of	mortgage	and	credit	card	fraud	,	and	he	will	be	released	from	wormwood	 scrub 	 s 	 	jail	in	london	in	2012	.

born	in	meridian	,	idaho	.

now	the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	about	all	of	these	people	is	they	share	certain	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	they	come	from	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 environment 	 s 	 	.
they	are	all	people	who	 learn 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 hack 	 ing 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	early	to	mid	-	 teen 	 s 	 	.
they	are	all	people	who	 demonst 	 rate 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	ability	in	 math 	 s 	 	and	the	 science 	 s 	 	.
remember	that	,	when	they	 develop 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 hack 	 ing 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	moral	compass	had	not	yet	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
and	most	of	them	,	with	the	exception	of	script	and	cha0	,	they	did	not	 demonst 	 rate 	 	any	real	social	 skill 	 s 	 	in	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	--	 on 	 ly 	 	on	the	web	.
and	the	other	thing	is	the	high	incidence	of	 hack 	 ers 	 	like	these	who	have	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	which	are	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	asperger	's	syndrome	.
now	i	 discuss 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	professor	simon	baron	-	cohen	who	's	the	professor	of	 develop 	 mental 	 	 psychopath 	 ology 	 	at	cambridge	.
and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	path	-	 break 	 ing 	 	work	on	 aut 	 ism 	 	and	 confirm 	 ed 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	for	the	 author 	 ities 	 	here	,	that	gary	mckinnon	--	who	is	 want 	 ed 	 	by	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	for	 hack 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pent 	 agon 	 	--	 suffer 	 s 	 	from	asperger	's	and	a	 second 	 ary 	 	condition	of	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
and	baron	-	cohen	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	certain	 dis 	 abilities 	 	can	manifest	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	 hack 	 ing 	 	and	computing	world	 a 	 s 	 	tremendous	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	that	we	should	not	be	 throw 	 ing 	 	in	jail	people	who	have	 s 	 uch 	 	 dis 	 abilities 	 	and	 skill 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	way	 social 	 ly 	 	or	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 up 	 ed 	 	.
now	i	think	we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	a	trick	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	think	people	like	max	vision	should	be	in	jail	.
and	let	me	be	blunt	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	in	russia	and	in	 load 	 s 	 	of	other	 count 	 ries 	 	that	are	 develop 	 ing 	 	cyber	-	offensive	 cap 	 abilities 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
they	are	 recruit 	 ing 	 	 hack 	 ers 	 	both	before	and	after	they	 be 	 come 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	criminal	and	industrial	 es 	 p 	 ion 	 age 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	--	are	 mobil 	 izing 	 	them	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	the	state	.
we	need	to	engage	and	find	ways	of	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	 gui 	 dance 	 	to	these	young	people	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	a	 remark 	 able 	 	breed	.
and	if	we	 re 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	at	the	moment	,	 sole 	 ly 	 	on	the	criminal	justice	system	and	the	threat	of	 pun 	 it 	 ive 	 	 sentence 	 s 	 	,	we	will	be	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	a	 mon 	 ster 	 	we	can	not	tame	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
chris	anderson	:	so	your	idea	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	is	hire	 hack 	 ers 	 	.
how	would	 some 	 one 	 	get	over	that	kind	of	fear	that	the	 hack 	 er 	 	they	hire	might	preserve	that	little	 teen 	 s 	 y 	 	 worm 	 hole 	 	?
mg	:	i	think	to	an	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	you	have	to	understand	that	it	's	 axiom 	 atic 	 	among	 hack 	 ers 	 	that	they	do	that	.
they	're	just	 relent 	 less 	 	and	 obsess 	 ive 	 	about	what	they	do	.
but	all	of	the	people	who	i	've	spoken	to	who	have	 fall 	 en 	 	foul	of	the	law	,	they	have	all	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	give	us	a	chance	to	work	in	the	legitimate	industry	.
we	just	never	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	get	there	,	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
we	want	to	work	with	you	.	``
chris	anderson	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	well	that	 make 	 s 	 	sense	.	 thank 	 s 	 	a	lot	misha	.
