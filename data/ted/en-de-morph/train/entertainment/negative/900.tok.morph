it	's	a	great	honor	 to 	 day 	 	to	share	with	you	the	digital	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	which	was	 create 	 d 	 	for	 human 	 ity 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	see	where	we	are	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	so	i	think	we	can	roll	the	video	that	we	have	.
[	the	himalayas	.	]	the	flat	horizon	that	we	've	 evolv 	 ed 	 	with	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	metaphor	for	the	infinite	:	 un 	 bound 	 ed 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	 dispos 	 al 	 	of	waste	.
it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	left	earth	,	got	above	the	atmosphere	and	had	 s 	 een 	 	the	horizon	bend	back	on	 it 	 self 	 	,	that	we	could	understand	our	planet	 a 	 s 	 	a	 limit 	 ed 	 	condition	.
the	digital	 uni 	 verse 	 	atlas	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	built	at	the	american	museum	of	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	over	the	past	12	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	maintain	that	,	put	that	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	project	to	 re 	 ally 	 	chart	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	all	 scale 	 s 	 	.
what	we	see	here	are	 satellite 	 s 	 	around	the	earth	and	the	earth	in	proper	 registr 	 ation 	 	against	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	.
nasa	 support 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	12	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	 re 	 building 	 	of	the	hayden	 planet 	 arium 	 	so	that	we	would	share	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	world	.
the	digital	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	our	space	show	 production 	 s 	 	that	we	do	--	our	main	space	 show 	 s 	 	in	the	 dom 	 e 	 	.
but	what	you	see	here	is	the	result	of	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 intern 	 ship 	 s 	 	that	we	 host 	 ed 	 	with	linkoping	university	in	sweden	.
i	've	had	12	 student 	 s 	 	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	graduate	work	,	and	the	result	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	uniview	and	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	sciss	in	sweden	.
 th 	 is 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	use	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	actual	flight	path	and	movie	that	we	see	here	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 flow 	 n 	 	live	.
i	 capture 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	live	from	my	 lap 	 top 	 	in	a	cafe	 call 	 ed 	 	earth	 matter 	 s 	 	on	the	lower	east	side	of	manhattan	,	where	i	live	,	and	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 collabor 	 ative 	 	project	with	the	rubin	museum	of	himalayan	art	for	an	exhibit	on	 compar 	 ative 	 	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	.
and	so	 a 	 s 	 	we	move	out	,	we	see	 continu 	 ously 	 	from	our	planet	all	the	way	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	realm	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	here	,	light	-	travel	time	,	giving	you	a	sense	of	how	far	away	we	are	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	move	out	,	the	light	from	these	 di 	 stant 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	have	taken	so	long	,	we	're	 essential 	 ly 	 	 back 	 ing 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	past	.
we	back	so	far	up	we	're	 final 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	a	 contain 	 ment 	 	around	us	--	the	 after 	 glow 	 	of	the	big	bang	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	wmap	 micro 	 wave 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	that	we	see	.
we	'll	fly	 out 	 side 	 	it	here	,	just	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 contain 	 ment 	 	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 out 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	would	 al 	 most 	 	be	 meaning 	 less 	 	,	in	the	sense	 a 	 s 	 	before	time	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	our	 contain 	 ment 	 	of	the	visible	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
we	know	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 big 	 ger 	 	than	that	which	we	can	see	.
coming	back	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	we	see	here	the	radio	sphere	that	we	 jump 	 ed 	 	out	of	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	but	these	are	 position 	 s 	 	,	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 position 	 s 	 	of	 exo 	 planet 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 ma 	 pped 	 	,	and	our	 s 	 un 	 	here	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	with	our	own	solar	system	.
what	you	're	going	to	see	--	we	're	going	to	have	to	jump	in	here	 pre 	 tty 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	between	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 order 	 s 	 	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	to	get	down	to	where	we	see	the	solar	system	--	these	are	the	 path 	 s 	 	of	voyager	1	,	voyager	2	,	pioneer	11	and	pioneer	10	,	the	first	four	 space 	 craft 	 	to	have	left	the	solar	system	.
coming	in	 close 	 r 	 	,	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	earth	,	orbit	of	the	moon	,	and	we	see	the	earth	.
 th 	 is 	 	map	can	be	 update 	 d 	 	,	and	we	can	add	in	new	data	.
i	know	dr.	carolyn	porco	is	the	camera	p.i	.
for	the	cassini	mission	.
but	here	we	see	the	complex	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	of	the	cassini	mission	color	 cod 	 ed 	 	for	different	mission	 phase 	 s 	 	,	 ing 	 en 	 iously 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	so	that	45	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	with	the	largest	moon	,	titan	,	which	is	 large 	 r 	 	that	the	planet	 merc 	 ury 	 	,	 divert 	 s 	 	the	orbit	 in 	 to 	 	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	mission	phase	.
 th 	 is 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	come	close	and	look	at	 part 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	 network 	 ed 	 	between	 dom 	 es 	 	.
we	have	a	growing	user	base	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	network	 dom 	 es 	 	.
and	we	can	network	between	 dom 	 es 	 	and	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	sharing	 tour 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	with	the	first	sub	-	saharan	 planet 	 arium 	 	in	ghana	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	new	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	built	in	the	 ghetto 	 s 	 	in	columbia	and	a	high	school	in	cambodia	.
and	the	cambodians	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	controlled	the	hayden	 planet 	 arium 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	high	school	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	from	saturday	,	 photograph 	 ed 	 	by	the	aqua	satellite	,	but	through	the	uniview	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
so	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	edge	of	the	earth	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	nepal	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	in	fact	,	right	here	is	the	 val 	 ley 	 	of	lhasa	,	right	here	in	tibet	.
but	we	can	see	the	 ha 	 ze 	 	from	 fire 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	in	the	ganges	 val 	 ley 	 	down	 be 	 low 	 	in	india	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	nepal	and	tibet	.
and	just	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	i	'd	just	like	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	world	that	we	live	on	--	here	we	see	a	bit	of	the	snow	that	some	of	you	may	have	had	to	brave	in	coming	out	--	so	i	'd	like	to	just	say	that	what	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	is	a	sense	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	look	at	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	much	 large 	 r 	 	condition	now	and	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	sense	of	what	home	is	.
 be 	 cause 	 	our	home	is	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	we	are	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	.
we	carry	that	in	us	.
and	to	be	able	to	see	our	 con 	 text 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 large 	 r 	 	sense	at	all	 scale 	 s 	 	 help 	 s 	 	us	all	,	i	think	,	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	where	we	are	and	who	we	are	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
thank	you	.
