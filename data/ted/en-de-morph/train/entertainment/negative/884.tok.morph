so	since	i	was	here	last	in	'06	,	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	global	climate	change	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	out	to	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	serious	issue	,	so	we	 cover 	 ed 	 	that	 fair 	 ly 	 	 extens 	 ively 	 	in	skeptic	magazine	.
we	investigate	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	scientific	and	quasi	-	scientific	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 ies 	 	,	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	any	of	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	world	's	going	to	end	in	2012	.
 an 	 other 	 	update	:	you	will	recall	i	 introduc 	 ed 	 	you	 guy 	 s 	 	to	the	quadro	 track 	 er 	 	.
it	's	like	a	water	 d 	 ow 	 s 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
it	's	just	a	hollow	piece	of	plastic	with	an	antenna	that	 swivel 	 s 	 	around	.
and	you	walk	around	,	and	it	 point 	 s 	 	to	 thing 	 s 	 	.
like	if	you	're	looking	for	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	in	 student 	 s 	 	'	 lock 	 ers 	 	,	it	'll	point	right	to	 some 	 body 	 	.
oh	,	sorry	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	one	that	was	 give 	 n 	 	to	me	 find 	 s 	 	golf	 ball 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	're	at	a	golf	course	and	you	check	under	 en 	 ough 	 	 bush 	 es 	 	.
well	,	under	the	 categor 	 y 	 	of	``	what	's	the	harm	of	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	the	ade	651	,	was	 s 	 old 	 	to	the	iraqi	government	for	40,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	 a 	 piece 	 	.
it	's	just	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 worth 	 less 	 	,	in	which	it	 alle 	 ged 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	by	``	 electro 	 static 	 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	ion	 attract 	 ion 	 	,	``	which	 transl 	 ates 	 	to	``	 pseudo 	 scientific 	 	baloney	``	--	would	be	the	nice	word	--	in	which	you	string	together	a	bunch	of	 word 	 s 	 	that	sound	good	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	at	trespass	 point 	 s 	 	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	people	to	go	through	 be 	 cause 	 	your	little	 track 	 er 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	cost	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	there	is	a	danger	to	 pseudo 	 science 	 	,	in	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.
so	what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	belief	.
i	want	to	 believ 	 e 	 	,	and	you	do	too	.
and	in	fact	,	i	think	my	thesis	here	is	that	belief	is	the	natural	state	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	is	the	default	option	.	we	just	 believ 	 e 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
belief	is	natural	;	 dis 	 belief 	 	,	 skeptic 	 ism 	 	,	science	,	is	not	natural	.
it	's	more	difficult	.
it	's	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	to	not	 believ 	 e 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	like	fox	mulder	on	``	x	-	 file 	 s 	 	,	``	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	ufos	?	well	,	we	all	do	,	and	the	reason	for	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	a	belief	engine	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
 essential 	 ly 	 	,	we	are	pattern	-	seeking	 prim 	 ates 	 	.
we	connect	the	 dot 	 s 	 	:	a	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	b	;	b	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	c	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	b	,	and	that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 associ 	 ation 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
we	find	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	we	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	pavlov	's	dog	here	 associ 	 ating 	 	the	sound	of	the	bell	with	the	food	,	and	then	he	 saliva 	 tes 	 	to	the	sound	of	the	bell	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	skinnerian	rat	,	in	which	he	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	 associ 	 ation 	 	between	his	behavior	and	a	reward	for	it	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	he	 repeat 	 s 	 	the	behavior	.
in	fact	,	what	skinner	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	that	,	if	you	put	a	pigeon	in	a	box	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	press	one	of	these	two	 key 	 s 	 	,	and	he	tries	to	figure	out	what	the	pattern	is	,	and	you	give	him	a	little	reward	in	the	hopper	box	there	--	if	you	just	 random 	 ly 	 	assign	 reward 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	that	there	is	no	pattern	,	they	will	figure	out	any	kind	of	pattern	.
and	 what 	 ever 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	just	before	they	got	the	reward	,	they	repeat	that	 part 	 icular 	 	pattern	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	was	even	 s 	 pinning 	 	around	twice	 counter 	 clock 	 wise 	 	,	once	 clock 	 wise 	 	and	peck	the	key	twice	.
and	that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 super 	 st 	 ition 	 	,	and	that	,	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	,	we	will	 al 	 ways 	 	have	with	us	.
i	call	 th 	 is 	 	process	``	 pattern 	 icity 	 	``	--	that	is	,	the	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	find	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	both	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	 meaning 	 less 	 	noise	.
when	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	we	make	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	 error 	 s 	 	.
a	type	i	error	,	or	false	positive	,	is	 believ 	 ing 	 	a	pattern	is	real	when	it	's	not	.
our	second	type	of	error	is	a	false	negative	.
a	type	ii	error	is	not	 believ 	 ing 	 	a	pattern	is	real	when	it	is	.
so	let	's	do	a	thought	experiment	.
you	are	a	hominid	three	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 walk 	 ing 	 	on	the	 plain 	 s 	 	of	africa	.
your	name	is	lucy	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
and	you	hear	a	 rust 	 le 	 	in	the	grass	.
is	it	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	predator	,	or	is	it	just	the	wind	?
your	next	decision	could	be	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	one	of	your	life	.
well	,	if	you	think	that	the	 rust 	 le 	 	in	the	grass	is	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	predator	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	just	the	wind	,	you	've	made	an	error	in	cognition	,	made	a	type	i	error	,	false	positive	.
but	no	harm	.	you	just	move	away	.
you	're	more	 c 	 aut 	 ious 	 	.	you	're	more	 vigil 	 ant 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 rust 	 le 	 	in	the	grass	is	just	the	wind	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	predator	,	you	're	lunch	.
you	've	just	won	a	darwin	 a 	 ward 	 	.
you	've	 be 	 en 	 	taken	out	of	the	gene	pool	.
now	the	problem	here	is	that	 pattern 	 ic 	 ities 	 	will	occur	 when 	 ever 	 	the	cost	of	making	a	type	i	error	is	less	than	the	cost	of	making	a	type	ii	error	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	in	the	talk	by	the	way	.
we	have	a	pattern	 detect 	 ion 	 	problem	that	is	 assess 	 ing 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	type	i	and	a	type	ii	error	is	 high 	 ly 	 	 problem 	 atic 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	split	-	second	,	life	-	and	-	death	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
so	the	default	position	is	just	:	 believ 	 e 	 	all	 pattern 	 s 	 	are	real	--	all	 rust 	 les 	 	in	the	grass	are	 danger 	 ous 	 	 predator 	 s 	 	and	not	just	the	wind	.
and	so	i	think	that	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	...
there	was	a	natural	 s 	 election 	 	for	the	 prop 	 en 	 s 	 ity 	 	for	our	belief	 engine 	 s 	 	,	our	pattern	-	seeking	brain	 process 	 es 	 	,	to	 al 	 ways 	 	find	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 fuse 	 	them	with	these	sort	of	 predator 	 y 	 	or	intentional	 age 	 ncies 	 	that	i	'll	come	back	to	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	what	do	you	see	here	?
it	's	a	horse	head	,	that	's	right	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	horse	.	it	must	be	a	horse	.
that	's	a	pattern	.
and	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	a	horse	?
or	is	it	more	like	a	frog	?
see	,	our	pattern	 detect 	 ion 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	which	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	 locate 	 d 	 	in	the	 an 	 terior 	 	 c 	 ing 	 ulate 	 	cortex	--	it	's	our	little	 detect 	 ion 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	there	--	can	be	 eas 	 ily 	 	 fool 	 ed 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	problem	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	what	do	you	see	here	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	of	course	,	it	's	a	cow	.
once	i	prime	the	brain	--	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	cognitive	 prim 	 ing 	 	--	once	i	prime	the	brain	to	see	it	,	it	 pop 	 s 	 	back	out	 aga 	 in 	 	even	 with 	 out 	 	the	pattern	that	i	've	 impose 	 d 	 	on	it	.
and	what	do	you	see	here	?
some	people	see	a	dalmatian	dog	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	there	it	is	.	and	there	's	the	prime	.
so	when	i	go	back	 with 	 out 	 	the	prime	,	your	brain	 al 	 ready 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	model	so	you	can	see	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
what	do	you	see	here	?
planet	saturn	.	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	's	good	.
how	about	here	?
just	shout	out	 any 	 thing 	 	you	see	.
that	's	a	good	audience	,	chris	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	.	well	,	 alle 	 ged 	 ly 	 	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	experiment	 d 	 one 	 	by	jennifer	whitson	at	u.t	.	austin	and	 whet 	 her 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	and	out	of	control	 make 	 s 	 	people	see	 ill 	 us 	 ory 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
that	is	,	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 s 	 ees 	 	the	planet	saturn	.
people	that	are	put	in	a	condition	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	out	of	control	are	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	see	 some 	 thing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	 alle 	 ged 	 ly 	 	 pattern 	 less 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	 prop 	 en 	 s 	 ity 	 	to	find	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	when	there	's	a	lack	of	control	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 base 	 ball 	 	 player 	 s 	 	are	 notorious 	 ly 	 	 super 	 stit 	 ious 	 	when	they	're	 batt 	 ing 	 	,	but	not	so	much	when	they	're	 field 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 field 	 ers 	 	are	 success 	 ful 	 	90	to	95	percent	of	the	time	.
the	best	 batt 	 ers 	 	fail	seven	out	of	10	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	 the 	 ir 	 	 super 	 stit 	 ions 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 pattern 	 ic 	 ities 	 	,	are	all	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	lack	of	control	and	so	forth	.
what	do	you	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	one	here	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	?
 any 	 body 	 	see	an	object	there	?
there	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	here	,	but	it	's	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	.
while	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	experiment	 d 	 one 	 	by	susan	blackmore	,	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	in	england	,	who	 show 	 ed 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	image	and	then	ran	a	correlation	between	 the 	 ir 	 	 score 	 s 	 	on	an	esp	test	:	how	much	did	they	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 para 	 normal 	 	,	 super 	 natural 	 	,	 angel 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 score 	 d 	 	high	on	the	esp	scale	,	 tend 	 ed 	 	to	not	 on 	 ly 	 	see	more	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	the	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	 image 	 s 	 	but	 in 	 correct 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
here	is	what	you	show	 subject 	 s 	 	.
the	fish	is	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	20	percent	,	50	percent	and	then	the	one	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	70	percent	.
a	similar	experiment	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	 an 	 other 	 	[	swiss	]	 psycho 	 logist 	 	named	peter	brugger	,	who	found	 significant 	 ly 	 	more	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 perceive 	 d 	 	on	the	right	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	via	the	left	visual	field	,	than	the	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	.
so	if	you	present	 subject 	 s 	 	the	 image 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	that	it	's	going	to	end	up	on	the	right	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	left	,	then	they	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	see	 pattern 	 s 	 	than	if	you	put	it	on	the	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	.
our	right	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	where	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	 pattern 	 icity 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	bore	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	to	see	where	all	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
brugger	and	his	 col 	 league 	 	,	christine	mohr	,	 g 	 ave 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	l	-	dopa	.
l	-	dopa	's	a	drug	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	 give 	 n 	 	for	 treat 	 ing 	 	parkinson	's	disease	,	which	is	related	to	a	 de 	 crease 	 	in	dopamine	.
l	-	dopa	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	dopamine	.
an	 in 	 crease 	 	of	dopamine	 caus 	 ed 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	to	see	more	 pattern 	 s 	 	than	 t 	 hose 	 	that	did	not	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	dopamine	.
so	dopamine	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	the	drug	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 pattern 	 icity 	 	.
in	fact	,	 neuro 	 lep 	 tic 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	that	are	used	to	eliminate	 psycho 	 tic 	 	behavior	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 para 	 no 	 ia 	 	,	 delusion 	 s 	 	and	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	these	are	 pattern 	 ic 	 ities 	 	.
they	're	 in 	 correct 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.	they	're	false	 positive 	 s 	 	.	they	're	type	i	 error 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	give	them	 drug 	 s 	 	that	are	dopamine	 ant 	 agon 	 ists 	 	,	they	go	away	.
that	is	,	you	 de 	 crease 	 	the	amount	of	dopamine	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	see	 pattern 	 s 	 	like	that	 de 	 crease 	 s 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	 amphet 	 amines 	 	like	 coca 	 ine 	 	are	dopamine	 agon 	 ists 	 	.
they	 in 	 crease 	 	the	amount	of	dopamine	.
so	you	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	feel	in	a	euphoric	state	,	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	find	more	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	saw	 rob 	 in 	 	williams	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	talk	about	how	he	thought	he	was	much	 funni 	 er 	 	when	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 coca 	 ine 	 	,	when	he	had	that	issue	,	than	now	.
so	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	dopamine	is	related	to	more	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
dopamine	,	i	think	,	 change 	 s 	 	our	signal	-	to	-	noise	ratio	.
that	is	,	how	accurate	we	are	in	 find 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
if	it	's	too	low	,	you	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	make	too	 man 	 y 	 	type	ii	 error 	 s 	 	.
you	 mis 	 s 	 	the	real	 pattern 	 s 	 	.	you	do	n't	want	to	be	too	 skeptic 	 al 	 	.
if	you	're	too	 skeptic 	 al 	 	,	you	'll	 mis 	 s 	 	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	good	 idea 	 s 	 	.
just	right	,	you	're	creative	,	and	yet	you	do	n't	fall	for	too	much	baloney	.
too	high	and	 may 	 be 	 	you	see	 pattern 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
every	time	 some 	 body 	 	 look 	 s 	 	at	you	,	you	think	people	are	 star 	 ing 	 	at	you	.
you	think	people	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	you	.
and	if	you	go	too	far	on	that	,	that	's	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	 label 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 mad 	 ness 	 	.
it	's	a	 distinct 	 ion 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	might	make	between	two	 no 	 bel 	 	 laureate 	 s 	 	,	richard	feynman	and	john	nash	.
one	 s 	 ees 	 	 may 	 be 	 	just	the	right	number	of	 pattern 	 s 	 	to	win	a	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	.
the	other	one	 al 	 so 	 	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	too	 man 	 y 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
and	we	then	call	that	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	.
so	the	signal	-	to	-	noise	ratio	then	 present 	 s 	 	us	with	a	pattern	-	 detect 	 ion 	 	problem	.
and	of	course	you	all	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	right	?
and	what	pattern	do	you	see	here	?
 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	'm	 put 	 ting 	 	your	 an 	 terior 	 	 c 	 ing 	 ulate 	 	cortex	to	the	test	here	,	 caus 	 ing 	 	you	 conflict 	 ing 	 	pattern	 detect 	 ions 	 	.
you	know	,	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	via	uno	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 sand 	 al 	 s 	 	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	sexy	feet	,	i	must	say	.
 may 	 be 	 	a	little	photoshopped	.
and	of	course	,	the	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	that	seem	to	flip	-	flop	back	and	forth	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	a	lot	 influence 	 s 	 	what	you	tend	to	see	.
and	you	see	the	lamp	here	,	i	know	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 light 	 s 	 	on	here	.
of	course	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	 environment 	 alist 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	we	're	all	sensitive	to	the	 p 	 light 	 	of	marine	 mammal 	 s 	 	.
so	what	you	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	figure	is	,	of	course	,	the	 dolphin 	 s 	 	,	right	?
you	see	a	dolphin	here	,	and	there	's	a	dolphin	,	and	there	's	a	dolphin	.
that	's	a	dolphin	tail	there	,	 guy 	 s 	 	.
if	we	can	give	you	 conflict 	 ing 	 	data	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	your	acc	is	going	to	be	going	 in 	 to 	 	 hyper 	 drive 	 	.
if	you	look	down	here	,	it	's	fine	.	if	you	look	up	here	,	then	you	get	 conflict 	 ing 	 	data	.
and	then	we	have	to	flip	the	image	for	you	to	see	that	it	's	a	set	up	.

it	's	easy	to	fool	the	brain	in	2d	.

and	he	was	kind	 en 	 ough 	 	to	post	 th 	 is 	 	and	give	us	the	reveal	.
of	course	,	camera	angle	is	 every 	 thing 	 	.	the	 photograph 	 er 	 	is	over	there	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	board	 appear 	 s 	 	to	 over 	 lap 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	with	that	one	,	and	so	on	.
but	even	when	i	take	it	away	,	the	illusion	is	so	 power 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	how	are	 brain 	 s 	 	are	wired	to	find	 t 	 hose 	 	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	new	one	that	 throw 	 s 	 	us	off	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 conflict 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 compar 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	angle	with	that	angle	.
in	fact	,	it	's	the	exact	same	picture	side	by	side	.
so	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 compar 	 ing 	 	that	angle	 in 	 stead 	 	of	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	but	with	that	one	.
and	so	your	brain	is	 fool 	 ed 	 	.
yet	 aga 	 in 	 	,	your	pattern	 detect 	 ion 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	are	 fool 	 ed 	 	.
 face 	 s 	 	are	easy	to	see	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	an	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 fa 	 cial 	 	 re 	 cognition 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	in	our	temporal	 lobe 	 s 	 	.
here	's	some	 face 	 s 	 	on	the	side	of	a	rock	.
i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	even	 s 	 ure 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	 th 	 is 	 	might	be	photoshopped	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	point	is	still	made	.
now	which	one	of	these	 look 	 s 	 	odd	to	you	?
in	a	quick	 re 	 action 	 	,	which	one	 look 	 s 	 	odd	?
the	one	on	the	left	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	i	'll	 rot 	 ate 	 	it	so	it	'll	be	the	one	on	the	right	.
and	you	are	correct	.
a	 fair 	 ly 	 	famous	illusion	--	it	was	first	 d 	 one 	 	with	margaret	thatcher	.
now	,	they	trade	up	the	 politic 	 ians 	 	every	time	.
well	,	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
well	,	we	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	in	the	temporal	lobe	,	right	 a 	 cross 	 	,	sort	of	above	your	ear	there	,	in	a	little	structure	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	.
and	there	's	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	that	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	record	 fa 	 cial 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	either	 global 	 ly 	 	,	or	 specific 	 ally 	 	these	large	,	rapid	-	 fir 	 ing 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	first	look	at	the	general	face	.
so	you	 recogn 	 ize 	 	obama	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
and	then	you	notice	 some 	 thing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	little	bit	odd	about	the	 eye 	 s 	 	and	the	mouth	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	they	're	 up 	 side 	 	down	,	you	're	 engag 	 ing 	 	that	general	 fa 	 cial 	 	 re 	 cognition 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	there	.
now	i	 s 	 aid 	 	back	in	our	little	thought	experiment	,	you	're	a	hominid	 walk 	 ing 	 	on	the	 plain 	 s 	 	of	africa	.
is	it	just	the	wind	or	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	predator	?
what	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	?
well	,	the	wind	is	 in 	 animate 	 	;	the	 danger 	 ous 	 	predator	is	an	intentional	agent	.
and	i	call	 th 	 is 	 	process	 agent 	 icity 	 	.
that	is	the	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	 in 	 fuse 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	with	meaning	,	 intent 	 ion 	 	and	 age 	 ncy 	 	,	often	 in 	 visible 	 	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	from	the	top	down	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	idea	that	we	got	from	a	fellow	tedster	here	,	dan	dennett	,	who	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	taking	the	intentional	stance	.
so	it	's	a	type	of	that	 expand 	 ed 	 	to	explain	,	i	think	,	a	lot	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	:	 soul 	 s 	 	,	 spirit 	 s 	 	,	 ghost 	 s 	 	,	 god 	 s 	 	,	 demo 	 ns 	 	,	 angel 	 s 	 	,	 alien 	 s 	 	,	intelligent	 design 	 ers 	 	,	government	 conspi 	 racist 	 s 	 	and	all	manner	of	 in 	 visible 	 	 agent 	 s 	 	with	power	and	 intent 	 ion 	 	,	are	 believ 	 ed 	 	to	haunt	our	world	and	control	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
i	think	it	's	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 anim 	 ism 	 	and	 poly 	 theism 	 	and	 mono 	 theism 	 	.
it	's	the	belief	that	 alien 	 s 	 	are	 some 	 how 	 	more	 advance 	 d 	 	than	us	,	more	moral	than	us	,	and	the	 narrative 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	are	that	they	're	coming	here	to	 s 	 ave 	 	us	and	 rescu 	 e 	 	us	from	on	high	.
the	intelligent	 design 	 er 	 	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 port 	 ray 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	super	intelligent	,	moral	 be 	 ing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	design	life	.
even	the	idea	that	government	can	 rescu 	 e 	 	us	--	that	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	wave	of	the	future	,	but	that	is	,	i	think	,	a	type	of	 agent 	 icity 	 	:	 project 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	up	there	,	big	and	 power 	 ful 	 	,	will	come	 rescu 	 e 	 	us	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	think	,	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 conspi 	 racy 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	.
there	's	 some 	 body 	 	 hid 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	there	 pull 	 ing 	 	the	 string 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	the	illuminati	or	the	bilderbergers	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	pattern	 detect 	 ion 	 	problem	,	is	n't	it	?
some	 pattern 	 s 	 	are	real	and	some	are	not	.
was	jfk	 assassin 	 ated 	 	by	a	 conspi 	 racy 	 	or	by	a	lone	assassin	?
well	,	if	you	go	there	--	there	's	people	there	on	any	 give 	 n 	 	day	--	like	when	i	went	there	,	here	--	 show 	 ing 	 	me	where	the	different	 shoot 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
my	 favor 	 ite 	 	one	was	he	was	in	the	 man 	 hole 	 	.
and	he	 pop 	 ped 	 	out	at	the	last	second	,	took	that	shot	.
but	of	course	,	lincoln	was	 assassin 	 ated 	 	by	a	 conspi 	 racy 	 	.
so	we	ca	n't	just	 uniform 	 ly 	 	dismiss	all	 pattern 	 s 	 	like	that	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	let	's	face	it	,	some	 pattern 	 s 	 	are	real	.
some	 conspi 	 r 	 acies 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	are	true	.
 explain 	 s 	 	a	lot	,	 may 	 be 	 	.
and	9/11	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 conspi 	 racy 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.	it	is	a	 conspi 	 racy 	 	.
we	did	a	whole	issue	on	it	.
 nine 	 teen 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	al	queda	 plot 	 ting 	 	to	fly	 plane 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 building 	 s 	 	 constitute 	 s 	 	a	 conspi 	 racy 	 	.
but	that	's	not	what	the	``	9/11	 truth 	 ers 	 	``	think	.
they	think	it	was	an	 in 	 side 	 	job	by	the	bush	 administr 	 ation 	 	.
well	,	that	's	a	whole	other	 lectur 	 e 	 	.
you	know	how	we	know	that	9/11	was	not	 orchestra 	 ted 	 	by	the	bush	 administr 	 ation 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.
so	we	are	natural	-	born	 dual 	 ists 	 	.
our	 agent 	 icity 	 	process	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	fact	that	we	can	enjoy	 movie 	 s 	 	like	these	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	imagine	,	in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	 continu 	 ing 	 	on	.
we	know	that	if	you	 stimul 	 ate 	 	the	temporal	lobe	,	you	can	produce	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	out	-	of	-	body	 experience 	 s 	 	,	near	-	death	 experience 	 s 	 	,	which	you	can	do	by	just	 touch 	 ing 	 	an	 electro 	 de 	 	to	the	temporal	lobe	there	.
or	you	can	do	it	through	loss	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	by	 accele 	 rating 	 	in	a	 cent 	 rifuge 	 	.
you	get	a	 hypo 	 xia 	 	,	or	a	lower	oxygen	.
and	the	brain	then	 sense 	 s 	 	that	there	's	an	out	-	of	-	body	experience	.
you	can	use	--	which	i	did	,	went	out	and	did	--	michael	persinger	's	god	helmet	,	that	 bombard 	 s 	 	your	temporal	 lobe 	 s 	 	with	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	.
and	you	get	a	sense	of	out	-	of	-	body	experience	.
so	i	'm	going	to	end	here	with	a	short	video	clip	that	sort	of	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	together	.
it	's	just	a	minute	and	a	half	.
it	ties	together	all	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	power	of	 expect 	 ation 	 	and	the	power	of	belief	.
go	 a 	 head 	 	and	roll	it	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	venue	they	chose	for	 the 	 ir 	 	fake	 audition 	 s 	 	for	an	advert	for	lip	balm	.
woman	:	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	we	can	use	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	national	commercial	,	right	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	test	on	some	lip	 balm 	 s 	 	that	we	have	over	here	.
and	these	are	our	 model 	 s 	 	who	are	going	to	help	us	,	roger	and	matt	.
and	we	have	our	own	lip	balm	,	and	we	have	a	 lead 	 ing 	 	brand	.
would	you	have	any	problem	 kiss 	 ing 	 	our	 model 	 s 	 	to	test	it	?
girl	:	no	.
woman	:	you	would	n't	?	woman	:	you	'd	think	that	was	fine	.
girl	:	that	would	be	fine	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	blind	test	.
i	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	put	a	 blind 	 fold 	 	on	.
kay	,	now	can	you	see	 any 	 thing 	 	?
pull	it	so	you	ca	n't	even	see	down	.
woman	:	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	blind	now	,	right	?
girl	:	 y 	 es 	 	.
now	,	what	i	'm	going	to	be	looking	for	in	 th 	 is 	 	test	is	how	it	 protect 	 s 	 	your	lips	,	the	 text 	 ure 	 	,	right	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	if	you	can	discern	any	flavor	or	not	.
girl	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
girl	:	no	.
woman	:	take	a	step	here	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	i	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	 puck 	 er 	 	up	.
 puck 	 er 	 	up	big	and	lean	in	just	a	little	bit	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
woman	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
and	,	jennifer	,	how	did	that	feel	?
jennifer	:	good	.
girl	:	oh	my	god	!
michael	shermer	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	thank	you	.	 thank 	 s 	 	.
