well	,	that	's	kind	of	an	obvious	 state 	 ment 	 	up	there	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	that	sentence	about	12	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	but	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	from	every	corner	of	the	world	.
so	if	you	think	of	a	map	of	your	country	,	i	think	you	'll	 real 	 ize 	 	that	for	every	country	on	earth	,	you	could	draw	little	 circle 	 s 	 	to	say	,	``	these	are	 place 	 s 	 	where	good	 teacher 	 s 	 	wo	n't	go	.	``
on	top	of	that	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 place 	 s 	 	from	where	trouble	 come 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	an	 iron 	 ic 	 	problem	--	good	 teacher 	 s 	 	do	n't	want	to	go	to	just	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	they	're	 need 	 ed 	 	the	most	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	1999	to	try	and	address	 th 	 is 	 	problem	with	an	experiment	,	which	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	experiment	in	new	delhi	.
i	 bas 	 ically 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	a	computer	 in 	 to 	 	a	wall	of	a	 s 	 lum 	 	in	new	delhi	.
the	children	 bare 	 ly 	 	went	to	school	,	they	did	n't	know	any	english	--	they	'd	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	computer	before	,	and	they	did	n't	know	what	the	 inter 	 net 	 	was	.
i	 connect 	 ed 	 	high	speed	 inter 	 net 	 	to	it	--	it	's	about	three	feet	off	the	ground	--	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	on	and	left	it	there	.
after	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 notice 	 d 	 	a	couple	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	you	'll	see	.
but	i	 repeat 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	over	india	and	then	through	a	large	part	of	the	world	and	 notice 	 d 	 	that	children	will	learn	to	do	what	they	want	to	learn	to	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	experiment	that	we	did	--	eight	year	-	old	boy	on	your	right	 teach 	 ing 	 	his	student	,	a	six	year	-	old	girl	,	and	he	was	 teach 	 ing 	 	her	how	to	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	boy	here	in	the	middle	of	central	india	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	rajasthan	village	,	where	the	children	 record 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	music	and	then	 play 	 ed 	 	it	back	to	each	other	and	in	the	process	,	they	've	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 thorough 	 ly 	 	.
they	did	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	four	 hour 	 s 	 	after	 see 	 ing 	 	the	computer	for	the	first	time	.
in	 an 	 other 	 	south	indian	village	,	these	 boy 	 s 	 	here	had	 assemble 	 d 	 	a	video	camera	and	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	the	photograph	of	a	bumble	bee	.
they	 download 	 ed 	 	it	from	disney.com	,	or	one	of	these	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	,	14	 day 	 s 	 	after	 put 	 ting 	 	the	computer	in	 the 	 ir 	 	village	.
so	at	the	end	of	it	,	we	 conclude 	 d 	 	that	 group 	 s 	 	of	children	can	learn	to	use	 computer 	 s 	 	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	,	 ir 	 respect 	 ive 	 	of	who	or	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
at	that	point	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	little	more	 ambit 	 ious 	 	and	 decide 	 d 	 	to	see	what	else	could	children	do	with	a	computer	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	off	with	an	experiment	in	hyderabad	,	india	,	where	i	 g 	 ave 	 	a	group	of	children	--	they	spoke	english	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	telugu	accent	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	computer	with	a	speech	-	to	-	text	 inter 	 face 	 	,	which	you	now	get	free	with	 window 	 s 	 	,	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	speak	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
so	when	they	spoke	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	the	computer	 type 	 d 	 	out	 gib 	 ber 	 ish 	 	,	so	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	understand	 any 	 thing 	 	of	what	we	are	 say 	 ing 	 	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	it	here	for	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
make	 your 	 self 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	to	the	computer	.	``
so	the	children	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	do	we	do	that	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.	``
and	i	left	.
two	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	 document 	 ed 	 	in	the	information	technology	for	 inter 	 national 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	journal	--	that	 accent 	 s 	 	had	 change 	 d 	 	and	 we 	 re 	 	 remark 	 ably 	 	close	to	the	neutral	british	accent	in	which	i	had	trained	the	speech	-	to	-	text	 synthesize 	 r 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 s 	 peaking 	 	like	james	tooley	.
so	they	could	do	that	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
after	that	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	experiment	with	 vari 	 ous 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	might	learn	to	do	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
i	got	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	phone	call	once	from	columbo	,	from	the	late	arthur	c.	clarke	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	to	see	what	's	going	on	.	``
and	he	could	n't	travel	,	so	i	went	over	there	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	two	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	``	a	teacher	that	can	be	 replace 	 d 	 	by	a	machine	should	be	.	``
the	second	thing	he	 s 	 aid 	 	was	that	,	``	if	children	have	interest	,	then	education	 happen 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	that	in	the	field	,	so	every	time	i	would	watch	it	and	think	of	him	.
arthur	c.	clarke	:	and	they	can	 definite 	 ly 	 	help	people	,	 be 	 cause 	 	children	 quick 	 ly 	 	learn	to	 navig 	 ate 	 	the	web	and	find	 thing 	 s 	 	which	interest	them	.
and	when	you	've	got	interest	,	then	you	have	education	.
sugata	mitra	:	i	took	the	experiment	to	south	africa	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	15	year	-	old	boy	.
boy	:	...	just	 ment 	 ion 	 	,	i	play	 game 	 s 	 	like	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	i	listen	to	music	.
sm	:	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	``	do	you	 s 	 end 	 	 email 	 s 	 	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	and	they	hop	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	cambodia	,	 r 	 ural 	 	cambodia	--	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	arithmetic	game	,	which	no	child	would	play	 in 	 side 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	or	at	home	.
they	would	,	you	know	,	throw	it	back	at	you	.
they	'd	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	.	``
if	you	 leav 	 e 	 	it	on	the	 pave 	 ment 	 	and	if	all	the	 adult 	 s 	 	go	away	,	then	they	will	show	off	with	each	other	about	what	they	can	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	these	children	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
they	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 multi 	 ply 	 	,	i	think	.
and	all	over	india	,	at	the	end	of	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	children	 we 	 re 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	google	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 work 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	tremendous	 improve 	 ments 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	english	--	rapid	 improve 	 ment 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	they	have	 be 	 come 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	deep	 think 	 ers 	 	and	so	on	and	so	forth	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	they	had	.
i	mean	,	if	there	's	stuff	on	google	,	why	would	you	need	to	stuff	it	 in 	 to 	 	your	head	?
so	at	the	end	of	the	next	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 group 	 s 	 	of	children	can	 navig 	 ate 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 education 	 al 	 	 object 	 ive 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
at	that	time	,	a	large	amount	of	money	had	come	 in 	 to 	 	newcastle	university	to	improve	 school 	 ing 	 	in	india	.
so	newcastle	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	call	.	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	do	it	from	delhi	.	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	's	no	way	you	're	going	to	handle	a	million	 pound 	 s 	 	-	worth	of	university	money	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	delhi	.	``
so	in	2006	,	i	 b 	 ought 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	heavy	 over 	 coat 	 	and	 move 	 d 	 	to	newcastle	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	test	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	the	system	.
the	first	experiment	i	did	out	of	newcastle	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	india	.
and	i	set	 my 	 self 	 	and	 im 	 possible 	 	target	:	can	tamil	 s 	 peaking 	 	12	-	year	-	old	children	in	a	south	indian	village	teach	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 bio 	 technology 	 	in	english	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	?
and	i	thought	,	i	'll	test	them	,	they	'll	get	a	zero	--	i	'll	give	the	 material 	 s 	 	,	i	'll	come	back	and	test	them	--	they	get	 an 	 other 	 	zero	,	i	'll	go	back	and	say	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	need	 teacher 	 s 	 	for	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	.	``
i	 call 	 ed 	 	in	26	children	.
they	all	came	in	there	,	and	i	told	them	that	there	's	some	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	stuff	on	 th 	 is 	 	computer	.
i	would	n't	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	if	you	did	n't	understand	 any 	 thing 	 	.
it	's	all	in	english	,	and	i	'm	going	.
so	i	left	them	with	it	.
i	came	back	after	two	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	the	26	children	 march 	 ed 	 	in	looking	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	quiet	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	did	you	look	at	any	of	the	stuff	?	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	did	.	``
``	did	you	understand	 any 	 thing 	 	?	``	``	no	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	how	long	did	you	practice	on	it	before	you	 decide 	 d 	 	you	 under 	 stood 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	?	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	look	at	it	every	day	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	for	two	 month 	 s 	 	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	stuff	you	did	n't	understand	?	``
so	a	12	year	-	old	girl	 raise 	 s 	 	her	hand	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	``	 a 	 part 	 	from	the	fact	that	 im 	 proper 	 	 replica 	 tion 	 	of	the	dna	molecule	 cause 	 s 	 	genetic	disease	,	we	've	 under 	 stood 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	.	``
it	took	me	three	 year 	 s 	 	to	publish	that	.
it	's	just	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	the	british	journal	of	 education 	 al 	 	technology	.
one	of	the	 refer 	 ees 	 	who	 refer 	 e 	 ed 	 	the	paper	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	too	good	to	be	true	,	``	which	was	not	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	.
well	,	one	of	the	 girl 	 s 	 	had	taught	 her 	 self 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	teacher	.
and	then	that	's	her	over	there	.
remember	,	they	do	n't	 stud 	 y 	 	english	.
i	 edit 	 ed 	 	out	the	last	bit	when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	where	is	the	 neuro 	 n 	 	?	``
and	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	 neuro 	 n 	 	?	the	 neuro 	 n 	 	,	``	and	then	she	 look 	 ed 	 	and	did	 th 	 is 	 	.
 what 	 ever 	 	the	 express 	 ion 	 	,	it	was	not	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	.
so	 the 	 ir 	 	 score 	 s 	 	had	gone	up	from	zero	to	30	percent	,	which	is	an	 education 	 al 	 	 im 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	under	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
but	30	percent	is	not	a	pass	.
so	i	found	that	they	had	a	friend	,	a	local	 account 	 ant 	 	,	a	young	girl	,	and	they	 play 	 ed 	 	 foot 	 ball 	 	with	her	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	that	girl	,	``	would	you	teach	them	 en 	 ough 	 	 bio 	 technology 	 	to	pass	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	would	i	do	that	?	i	do	n't	know	the	subject	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	use	the	method	of	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	that	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	you	've	got	to	do	is	stand	 be 	 hind 	 	them	and	admire	them	all	the	time	.
just	say	to	them	,	'	that	's	cool	.	that	's	fantastic	.
what	is	that	?	can	you	do	that	 aga 	 in 	 	?	can	you	show	me	some	more	?	'	``	she	did	that	for	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
the	 score 	 s 	 	went	up	to	50	,	which	is	what	the	 p 	 osh 	 	 school 	 s 	 	of	new	delhi	,	with	a	trained	 bio 	 technology 	 	teacher	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	.
so	i	came	back	to	newcastle	with	these	 result 	 s 	 	and	 decide 	 d 	 	that	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	that	 definite 	 ly 	 	was	 get 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	.
so	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 experiment 	 ed 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	remote	 place 	 s 	 	,	i	came	to	the	most	remote	place	that	i	could	think	of	.
 approximate 	 ly 	 	5,000	 mile 	 s 	 	from	delhi	is	the	little	town	of	gateshead	.
in	gateshead	,	i	took	32	children	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	fine	-	tune	the	method	.
i	made	them	 in 	 to 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	four	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	make	your	own	 group 	 s 	 	of	four	.
each	group	of	four	can	use	one	computer	and	not	four	 computer 	 s 	 	.	``
remember	,	from	the	hole	in	the	wall	.
``	you	can	 ex 	 change 	 	 group 	 s 	 	.
you	can	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	group	,	if	you	do	n't	like	your	group	,	etc	.
you	can	go	to	 an 	 other 	 	group	,	peer	over	 the 	 ir 	 	 shoulder 	 s 	 	,	see	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	come	back	to	you	own	group	and	claim	it	 a 	 s 	 	your	own	work	.	``
and	i	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	them	that	,	you	know	,	a	lot	of	scientific	research	is	 d 	 one 	 	using	that	method	.
the	children	 enthusiast 	 ically 	 	got	after	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	now	,	what	do	you	want	us	to	do	?	``
i	 g 	 ave 	 	them	six	gcse	 question 	 s 	 	.
the	first	group	--	the	best	one	--	 solve 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	in	20	 minute 	 s 	 	.
the	worst	,	in	45	.
they	used	 every 	 thing 	 	that	they	 k 	 new 	 	--	news	 group 	 s 	 	,	google	,	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	ask	jeeves	,	etc	.
the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	deep	 learn 	 ing 	 	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	let	's	try	it	.
i	'll	come	back	after	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
we	'll	give	them	a	paper	test	--	no	 computer 	 s 	 	,	no	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	,	 etc 	 . 	 	``
the	average	score	when	i	'd	 d 	 one 	 	it	with	the	 computer 	 s 	 	and	the	 group 	 s 	 	was	76	percent	.
when	i	did	the	experiment	,	when	i	did	the	test	,	after	two	 month 	 s 	 	,	the	score	was	76	percent	.
there	was	 photograph 	 ic 	 	recall	 in 	 side 	 	the	children	,	i	suspect	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 discuss 	 ing 	 	with	each	other	.
a	single	child	in	front	of	a	single	computer	will	not	do	that	.
i	have	further	 result 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 al 	 most 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	,	of	 score 	 s 	 	which	go	up	with	time	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	say	that	after	the	session	is	over	,	the	children	 continu 	 e 	 	to	google	further	.
here	in	britain	,	i	put	out	a	call	for	british	 grand 	 mother 	 s 	 	,	after	my	kuppam	experiment	.
well	,	you	know	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 vigor 	 ous 	 	people	,	british	 grand 	 mother 	 s 	 	.
200	of	them	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
the	deal	was	that	they	would	give	me	one	hour	of	 broad 	 band 	 	time	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,	one	day	in	a	week	.
so	they	did	that	,	and	over	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	over	600	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 instruct 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	over	skype	,	using	what	my	 student 	 s 	 	call	the	 grann 	 y 	 	cloud	.
the	 grann 	 y 	 	cloud	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	over	there	.
i	can	beam	them	to	 which 	 ever 	 	school	i	want	to	.
teacher	:	you	ca	n't	catch	me	.
you	say	it	.
you	ca	n't	catch	me	.
children	:	you	ca	n't	catch	me	.
teacher	:	i	'm	the	 ging 	 er 	 bread 	 	man	.
children	:	i	'm	the	 ging 	 er 	 bread 	 	man	.
teacher	:	well	 d 	 one 	 	.	 ver 	 y 	 	good	...
sm	:	back	at	gateshead	,	a	10	-	year	-	old	girl	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	heart	of	hinduism	in	15	 minute 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	stuff	which	i	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	.
two	children	watch	a	tedtalk	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	 foot 	 ball 	 ers 	 	before	.
after	 watch 	 ing 	 	eight	tedtalks	,	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	leonardo	da	vinci	.
it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	'm	building	now	--	they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	 sole 	 s 	 	:	self	 organize 	 d 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	.
the	furniture	is	designed	so	that	children	can	 s 	 it 	 	in	front	of	big	,	 power 	 ful 	 	 screen 	 s 	 	,	big	 broad 	 band 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	but	in	 group 	 s 	 	.
if	they	want	,	they	can	call	the	 grann 	 y 	 	cloud	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	sole	in	newcastle	.
the	 media 	 tor 	 	is	from	pune	,	india	.
so	how	far	can	we	go	?	one	last	little	bit	and	i	'll	stop	.
i	went	to	turin	in	may	.
i	 s 	 ent 	 	all	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	away	from	my	group	of	10	year	-	old	 student 	 s 	 	.
i	speak	 on 	 ly 	 	english	,	they	speak	 on 	 ly 	 	italian	,	so	we	had	no	way	to	communicate	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	english	 question 	 s 	 	on	the	 black 	 board 	 	.
the	children	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	do	it	.	``
they	 type 	 d 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	google	,	 transl 	 ated 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	italian	,	went	back	 in 	 to 	 	italian	google	.
fifteen	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	next	question	:	where	is	calcutta	?
 th 	 is 	 	one	,	they	took	 on 	 ly 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	one	then	.
who	was	pythagoras	,	and	what	did	he	do	?
there	was	silence	for	a	while	,	then	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	've	 spell 	 ed 	 	it	wrong	.
it	's	pitagora	.	``
and	then	,	in	20	 minute 	 s 	 	,	the	right	-	angled	 triangle 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	appear	on	the	 screen 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	 shiver 	 s 	 	up	my	 s 	 pine 	 	.
these	are	10	year	-	olds	.
text	:	in	 an 	 other 	 	30	 minute 	 s 	 	they	would	reach	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	.	and	then	?
sm	:	so	you	know	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
i	think	we	've	just	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	a	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	system	.
a	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	system	is	one	where	a	structure	 appear 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 	intervention	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	show	emergence	,	which	is	that	the	system	 start 	 s 	 	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	it	was	never	designed	for	.
which	is	why	you	react	the	way	you	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
i	think	i	can	make	a	guess	now	--	education	is	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	system	,	where	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	an	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
it	'll	take	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	to	prove	it	,	 experiment 	 ally 	 	,	but	i	'm	going	to	try	.
but	in	the	 mean 	 while 	 	,	there	is	a	method	 avail 	 able 	 	.
one	billion	children	,	we	need	100	million	 media 	 tors 	 	--	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	more	than	that	on	the	planet	--	10	million	 sole 	 s 	 	,	180	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	could	change	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
