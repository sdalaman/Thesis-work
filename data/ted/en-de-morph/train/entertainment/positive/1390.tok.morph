the	 re 	 cent 	 	debate	over	 copy 	 right 	 	 law 	 s 	 	like	sopa	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	acta	 agree 	 ment 	 	in	europe	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	.
and	i	think	some	 dis 	 passionate 	 	,	 quant 	 itative 	 	 reason 	 ing 	 	could	 re 	 ally 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	a	great	deal	to	the	debate	.
i	'd	 there 	 fore 	 	like	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	that	we	employ	,	we	enlist	,	the	cutting	edge	field	of	 copy 	 right 	 	math	 when 	 ever 	 	we	approach	 th 	 is 	 	subject	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	the	motion	picture	 associ 	 ation 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	that	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	58	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	to	 copy 	 right 	 	 t 	 heft 	 	.
now	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	 argu 	 e 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	number	,	a	 copy 	 right 	 	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	will	 analyz 	 e 	 	it	and	he	'll	soon	discover	that	 th 	 is 	 	money	could	stretch	from	 th 	 is 	 	 audit 	 orium 	 	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	ocean	boulevard	to	the	westin	,	and	then	to	mars	...
...	if	we	use	 penni 	 es 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	,	some	might	say	 danger 	 ously 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	 in 	 sight 	 	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 moral 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	one	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	just	the	hypothetical	 re 	 tail 	 	value	of	some	 pirate 	 d 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	actual	economic	 loss 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	the	entire	american	corn	crop	 fail 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	all	of	our	fruit	 crop 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	wheat	,	tobacco	,	rice	,	 s 	 org 	 hum 	 	--	 what 	 ever 	 	 s 	 org 	 hum 	 	is	--	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 s 	 org 	 hum 	 	.
but	 identify 	 ing 	 	the	actual	 loss 	 es 	 	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	do	 un 	 less 	 	we	use	 copy 	 right 	 	math	.
now	music	 revenue 	 s 	 	are	down	by	about	eight	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	since	napster	first	came	on	the	scene	.
so	that	's	a	chunk	of	what	we	're	looking	for	.
but	total	movie	 revenue 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 theater 	 s 	 	,	home	video	and	pay	-	per	-	view	are	up	.
and	tv	,	satellite	and	cable	 revenue 	 s 	 	are	way	up	.
other	content	 market 	 s 	 	like	book	 publish 	 ing 	 	and	radio	are	 al 	 so 	 	up	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	small	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	chunk	here	is	 puzzl 	 ing 	 	.
since	the	big	content	 market 	 s 	 	have	grown	in	line	with	historic	 norm 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	growth	that	 pi 	 racy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 prevent 	 ed 	 	,	but	 copy 	 right 	 	math	 tell 	 s 	 	us	it	must	 there 	 fore 	 	be	 fore 	 gone 	 	growth	in	a	market	that	 ha 	 s 	 	no	historic	 norm 	 s 	 	--	one	that	did	n't	exist	in	the	90	's	.
what	we	're	looking	at	here	is	the	 insid 	 ious 	 	cost	of	 ring 	 tone 	 	 pi 	 racy 	 	.
50	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	it	a	year	,	which	is	 en 	 ough 	 	,	at	30	 second 	 s 	 	a	 ring 	 tone 	 	,	that	could	stretch	from	here	to	neanderthal	 time 	 s 	 	.
it	's	true	.
i	have	excel	.
the	movie	 folk 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	tell	us	that	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	over	370,000	 job 	 s 	 	to	content	 t 	 heft 	 	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	when	you	consider	that	,	back	in	'98	,	the	bureau	of	labor	 statistic 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ated 	 	that	the	motion	picture	and	video	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 employ 	 ing 	 	270,000	people	.
other	data	 ha 	 s 	 	the	music	industry	at	about	45,000	people	.
and	so	the	job	 loss 	 es 	 	that	came	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	all	that	content	 t 	 heft 	 	,	have	 there 	 fore 	 	left	us	with	negative	 employ 	 ment 	 	in	our	content	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	mind	-	 blow 	 ing 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	that	 copy 	 right 	 	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	have	to	deal	with	every	day	.
and	some	people	think	that	string	 theor 	 y 	 	is	tough	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	key	number	from	the	 copy 	 right 	 	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	'	 tool 	 kit 	 	.
it	's	the	precise	amount	of	harm	that	 come 	 s 	 	to	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	a	single	 copy 	 right 	 ed 	 	song	or	movie	 get 	 s 	 	 pirate 	 d 	 	.
hollywood	and	congress	derived	 th 	 is 	 	number	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	back	when	they	last	 s 	 at 	 	down	to	improve	 copy 	 right 	 	 damage 	 s 	 	and	made	 th 	 is 	 	law	.
some	people	think	 th 	 is 	 	number	's	a	little	bit	large	,	but	 copy 	 right 	 	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	who	are	media	lobby	 expert 	 s 	 	are	 mere 	 ly 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	 com 	 pound 	 ed 	 	for	 infla 	 tion 	 	every	year	.
now	when	 th 	 is 	 	law	first	 pass 	 ed 	 	,	the	world	's	 hot 	 test 	 	mp	3	player	could	hold	just	10	 song 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	a	big	christmas	hit	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	little	 hood 	 lum 	 	would	n't	want	a	million	and	a	half	 buck 	 s 	 	-	worth	of	 stole 	 n 	 	 good 	 s 	 	in	his	pocket	.
these	 day 	 s 	 	an	ipod	classic	can	hold	40,000	 song 	 s 	 	,	which	is	to	say	eight	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	-	worth	of	 stole 	 n 	 	media	.
or	about	75,000	 job 	 s 	 	.
now	you	might	find	 copy 	 right 	 	math	strange	,	but	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	field	that	's	best	left	to	 expert 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	it	for	now	.
i	hope	you	'll	join	me	next	time	when	i	will	be	making	an	 equal 	 ly 	 	scientific	and	fact	-	based	 inquir 	 y 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	cost	of	alien	music	 pi 	 racy 	 	to	he	american	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
thank	you	.
