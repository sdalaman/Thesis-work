how	are	they	 en 	 titled 	 	to	practice	?
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	do	we	need	 any 	 one 	 	to	 inter 	 mediate 	 	for	us	in	order	to	have	an	experience	with	a	spiritual	divine	?

 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	we	now	live	in	a	world	defined	not	by	consumption	,	but	by	 particip 	 ation 	 	.
but	i	want	to	be	clear	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	the	religious	 reform 	 ation 	 	did	not	spell	the	end	to	the	 form 	 al 	 	church	or	to	the	 priest 	 hood 	 	;	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	our	 art 	 istic 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	have	 import 	 ance 	 	.

and	they	are	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	 artist 	 s 	 	who	deserve	and	want	to	work	at	a	certain	scale	of	 resource 	 s 	 	will	find	a	home	.
but	to	view	them	 a 	 s 	 	synonymous	with	the	 entire 	 ty 	 	of	the	 art 	 s 	 	community	is	,	by	far	,	too	short	-	 sight 	 ed 	 	.
