hi	,	my	name	is	roz	savage	and	i	row	 a 	 cross 	 	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 row 	 ed 	 	 s 	 olo 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	atlantic	,	and	since	then	,	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	two	out	of	three	 stage 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	from	san	francisco	to	hawaii	and	from	hawaii	to	kiribati	.
and	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	i	'll	be	 leav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	boat	to	fly	back	to	kiribati	to	 continu 	 e 	 	with	the	third	and	final	stage	of	my	row	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
 cumulative 	 ly 	 	,	i	will	have	 row 	 ed 	 	over	8,000	 mile 	 s 	 	,	taken	over	three	million	oar	 stroke 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 pent 	 	more	than	312	 day 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	on	the	ocean	on	a	23	foot	 row 	 boat 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	me	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	relationship	with	the	ocean	.
we	have	a	bit	of	a	love	/	hate	thing	going	on	.
i	feel	a	bit	about	it	like	i	did	about	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strict	math	teacher	that	i	once	had	at	school	.
i	did	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	like	her	,	but	i	did	respect	her	,	and	she	taught	me	a	heck	of	a	lot	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	some	of	my	ocean	 adventure 	 s 	 	and	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	what	they	've	taught	me	,	and	how	i	think	we	can	 may 	 be 	 	take	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	and	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	 th 	 is 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	we	face	right	now	.
now	,	some	of	you	might	be	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	hold	on	a	minute	.	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	an	ocean	 row 	 er 	 	.
is	n't	she	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	about	 th 	 is 	 	tall	and	about	 th 	 is 	 	wide	and	 may 	 be 	 	look	a	bit	more	like	these	 guy 	 s 	 	?	``
you	'll	notice	,	they	've	all	got	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	do	n't	.
well	,	i	do	n't	know	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 beard 	 s 	 	.
and	no	matter	how	long	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	on	the	ocean	,	i	have	n't	yet	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 must 	 er 	 	a	 de 	 cent 	 	beard	,	and	i	hope	that	it	 remain 	 s 	 	that	way	.
for	a	long	time	,	i	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	i	could	have	a	big	adventure	.
the	story	that	i	told	 my 	 self 	 	was	that	 adventure 	 rs 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	did	n't	look	the	part	.
i	thought	there	 we 	 re 	 	them	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	us	,	and	i	was	not	one	of	them	.
so	for	11	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 conform 	 ed 	 	.
i	did	what	people	from	my	kind	of	 back 	 ground 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	.
i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	in	an	 off 	 ice 	 	in	london	 a 	 s 	 	a	management	 consult 	 ant 	 	.
and	i	think	i	 k 	 new 	 	from	day	one	that	it	was	n't	the	right	job	for	me	.
but	that	kind	of	 condition 	 ing 	 	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	there	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	i	 reach 	 ed 	 	my	mid	-	30s	and	i	thought	,	``	you	know	,	i	'm	not	 get 	 ting 	 	any	 young 	 er 	 	.
i	feel	like	i	've	got	a	purpose	in	 th 	 is 	 	life	,	and	i	do	n't	know	what	it	is	,	but	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	certain	that	management	 consult 	 ancy 	 	is	not	it	.
so	,	fast	forward	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	gone	through	some	 change 	 s 	 	.
to	try	and	answer	that	question	of	,	``	what	am	i	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	with	my	life	?	``
i	 s 	 at 	 	down	one	day	and	wrote	two	 version 	 s 	 	of	my	own	 o 	 bit 	 uary 	 	,	the	one	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	,	a	life	of	adventure	,	and	the	one	that	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 head 	 ing 	 	for	which	was	a	nice	,	normal	,	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	,	but	it	was	n't	where	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	by	the	end	of	my	life	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	live	a	life	that	i	could	be	proud	of	.
and	i	remember	looking	at	these	two	 version 	 s 	 	of	my	 o 	 bit 	 uary 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	boy	,	i	'm	on	 total 	 ly 	 	the	wrong	track	here	.
if	i	carry	on	living	 a 	 s 	 	i	am	now	,	i	'm	just	not	going	to	end	up	where	i	want	to	be	in	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	or	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	or	at	the	end	of	my	life	.	``
i	made	a	few	 change 	 s 	 	,	let	go	of	some	loose	 trapping 	 s 	 	of	my	old	life	,	and	through	a	bit	of	a	leap	of	logic	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	row	 a 	 cross 	 	the	atlantic	ocean	.
the	atlantic	 row 	 ing 	 	race	 run 	 s 	 	from	the	 can 	 aries 	 	to	antigua	,	it	's	about	3,000	 mile 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	the	 hard 	 est 	 	thing	i	had	ever	 d 	 one 	 	.
 s 	 ure 	 	,	i	had	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	 out 	 side 	 	of	my	comfort	zone	,	but	what	i	'd	sort	of	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	notice	was	that	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	your	comfort	zone	is	,	by	definition	,	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
and	my	 tim 	 ing 	 	was	not	great	either	:	2005	,	when	i	did	the	atlantic	,	was	the	year	of	hurricane	katrina	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	more	 tropic 	 al 	 	 storm 	 s 	 	in	the	north	atlantic	than	ever	before	,	since	 record 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	.
and	 pre 	 tty 	 	early	on	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 storm 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 the 	 ir 	 	presence	known	.
all	four	of	my	 oar 	 s 	 	broke	before	i	 reach 	 ed 	 	 half 	 way 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
 oar 	 s 	 	are	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	what	can	you	do	?	you	're	in	the	middle	of	the	ocean	.
 oar 	 s 	 	are	your	 on 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	.
so	i	just	had	to	look	around	the	boat	and	figure	out	what	i	was	going	to	use	to	fix	up	these	 oar 	 s 	 	so	that	i	could	carry	on	.
so	i	found	a	boat	hook	and	my	 trust 	 y 	 	duct	tape	and	 splint 	 er 	 ed 	 	the	boat	hook	to	the	 oar 	 s 	 	to	reinforce	it	.
then	,	when	that	 g 	 ave 	 	out	,	i	 saw 	 ed 	 	the	wheel	 axle 	 s 	 	off	my	spare	 row 	 ing 	 	seat	and	used	 t 	 hose 	 	.
and	then	when	 t 	 hose 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	out	,	i	 cannibal 	 ized 	 	one	of	the	broken	 oar 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	never	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 fix 	 ing 	 	stuff	when	i	was	living	my	old	life	,	but	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	how	 resource 	 ful 	 	you	can	 be 	 come 	 	when	you	're	in	the	middle	of	the	ocean	and	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	way	to	get	to	the	other	side	.
and	the	 oar 	 s 	 	kind	of	 be 	 came 	 	a	symbol	of	just	in	how	 man 	 y 	 	ways	i	went	beyond	what	i	thought	 we 	 re 	 	my	 limit 	 s 	 	.
i	 suffer 	 ed 	 	from	 tend 	 initi 	 s 	 	on	my	 shoulder 	 s 	 	and	 salt 	 water 	 	 sore 	 s 	 	on	my	bottom	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	 struggle 	 d 	 	 psycho 	 logically 	 	,	 total 	 ly 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	the	scale	of	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 real 	 izing 	 	that	,	if	i	carried	on	moving	at	two	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	3,000	 mile 	 s 	 	was	going	to	take	me	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	when	i	thought	i	'd	hit	that	limit	,	but	had	no	choice	but	to	just	carry	on	and	try	and	figure	out	how	i	was	going	to	get	to	the	other	side	 with 	 out 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	crazy	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	after	103	 day 	 s 	 	at	sea	,	i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	antigua	.
i	do	n't	think	i	've	ever	felt	so	happy	in	my	entire	life	.
it	was	a	bit	like	 finish 	 ing 	 	a	marathon	and	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	 con 	 fine 	 ment 	 	and	winning	an	oscar	all	 roll 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	.
i	was	euphoric	.
and	to	see	all	the	people	coming	out	to	greet	me	and	 stand 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	cliff	 top 	 s 	 	and	 clap 	 ping 	 	and	 cheer 	 ing 	 	,	i	just	felt	like	a	movie	star	.
it	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	then	that	,	the	 big 	 ger 	 	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	the	 big 	 ger 	 	the	sense	of	 achiev 	 ement 	 	when	you	get	to	the	end	of	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	might	be	a	good	moment	to	take	a	quick	time	-	out	to	answer	a	few	faqs	about	ocean	 row 	 ing 	 	that	might	be	going	through	your	mind	.
number	one	that	i	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	:	what	do	you	eat	?
a	few	freeze	-	dried	 meal 	 s 	 	,	but	 most 	 ly 	 	i	try	and	eat	much	more	 un 	 process 	 ed 	 	 food 	 s 	 	.
so	i	grow	my	own	 bean 	 sprout 	 s 	 	.
i	eat	 fruit 	 s 	 	and	nut	 bar 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	nuts	.
and	 general 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 e 	 	about	30	 pound 	 s 	 	 light 	 er 	 	at	the	other	end	.
question	number	two	:	how	do	you	sleep	?
with	my	 eye 	 s 	 	shut	.	ha	-	ha	.
i	suppose	what	you	mean	is	:	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	boat	while	i	'm	 sleep 	 ing 	 	?
well	,	i	plan	my	route	so	that	i	'm	 drift 	 ing 	 	with	the	 wind 	 s 	 	and	the	 current 	 s 	 	while	i	'm	 sleep 	 ing 	 	.
on	a	good	night	,	i	think	my	best	ever	was	11	 mile 	 s 	 	in	the	right	direction	.
worst	ever	,	13	 mile 	 s 	 	in	the	wrong	direction	.
that	's	a	bad	day	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
what	do	i	wear	?
 most 	 ly 	 	,	a	 base 	 ball 	 	cap	,	 row 	 ing 	 	 glove 	 s 	 	and	a	 s 	 mile 	 	--	or	a	frown	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	 whet 	 her 	 	i	went	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	 over 	 night 	 	--	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 	 lot 	 ion 	 	.
do	i	have	a	chase	boat	?
no	i	do	n't	.	i	'm	 total 	 ly 	 	self	-	 support 	 ing 	 	out	there	.
i	do	n't	see	 any 	 body 	 	for	the	whole	time	that	i	'm	at	sea	,	 general 	 ly 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	:	am	i	crazy	?
well	,	i	 leav 	 e 	 	that	one	up	to	you	to	 judg 	 e 	 	.
so	,	how	do	you	top	 row 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	atlantic	?
well	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	you	decide	to	row	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
well	,	i	thought	the	atlantic	was	big	,	but	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	big	.
i	think	we	tend	to	do	it	a	little	bit	of	a	 dis 	 service 	 	in	our	usual	 map 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	for	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	brits	 invent 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	view	of	the	world	,	but	i	suspect	we	might	have	 d 	 one 	 	so	:	we	are	right	in	the	middle	,	and	we	've	cut	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	in	half	and	 f 	 lung 	 	it	to	the	far	 corner 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	look	in	google	earth	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	 look 	 s 	 	.
it	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 cover 	 s 	 	half	the	planet	.
you	can	just	see	a	little	bit	of	north	america	up	here	and	a	 s 	 liver 	 	of	australia	down	there	.
it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	big	--	65	million	square	 mile 	 s 	 	--	and	to	row	in	a	straight	line	 a 	 cross 	 	it	would	be	about	8,000	 mile 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	ocean	 row 	 boat 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	go	in	a	straight	line	.
by	the	time	i	get	to	australia	,	if	i	get	to	australia	,	i	will	have	 row 	 ed 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	nine	or	10,000	 mile 	 s 	 	in	all	.
so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	straight	mind	would	row	straight	past	hawaii	 with 	 out 	 	dropping	in	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	cut	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 under 	 taking 	 	 in 	 to 	 	three	 segment 	 s 	 	.
the	first	attempt	did	n't	go	so	well	.
in	2007	,	i	did	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 in 	 voluntary 	 	 cap 	 s 	 ize 	 	drill	three	 time 	 s 	 	in	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.
a	bit	like	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	.
boat	got	a	bit	 d 	 ing 	 ed 	 	up	,	so	did	i	.
i	 blog 	 ged 	 	about	it	.	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 body 	 	with	a	bit	of	a	hero	complex	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 dam 	 s 	 el 	 	was	in	 di 	 stress 	 	and	 need 	 ed 	 	saving	.
the	first	i	 k 	 new 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	was	when	the	coast	guard	plane	 turn 	 ed 	 	up	 over 	 head 	 	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	tell	them	to	go	away	.
we	had	a	bit	of	a	battle	of	 will 	 s 	 	.
i	lost	and	got	 air 	 lift 	 ed 	 	.
awful	,	 re 	 ally 	 	awful	.
it	was	one	of	the	worst	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	my	life	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 lift 	 ed 	 	up	on	that	 win 	 ch 	 	line	 in 	 to 	 	the	helicopter	and	 look 	 ed 	 	down	at	my	 trust 	 y 	 	little	boat	 roll 	 ing 	 	around	in	the	20	foot	 wave 	 s 	 	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	if	i	would	ever	see	her	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	i	had	to	launch	a	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	salvage	operation	and	then	wait	 an 	 other 	 	nine	 month 	 s 	 	before	i	could	get	back	out	onto	the	ocean	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	what	do	you	do	?
fall	down	nine	 time 	 s 	 	,	get	up	10	.
so	,	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	year	,	i	set	out	and	,	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	time	made	it	 safe 	 ly 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	to	hawaii	.
but	it	was	not	 with 	 out 	 	 mis 	 adventure 	 	.
my	 water 	 maker 	 	broke	,	 on 	 ly 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	piece	of	kit	that	i	have	on	the	boat	.
powered	by	my	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	,	it	 suck 	 s 	 	in	 salt 	 water 	 	and	 turn 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 fresh 	 water 	 	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	react	 ver 	 y 	 	well	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	ocean	,	which	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	help	was	at	hand	.
there	was	 an 	 other 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	boat	out	there	at	the	same	time	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	to	the	north	 pac 	 ific 	 	garbage	patch	,	that	area	in	the	north	 pac 	 ific 	 	about	twice	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	texas	,	with	an	 estimate 	 d 	 	3.5	million	 ton 	 s 	 	of	trash	in	it	,	 circul 	 ating 	 	at	the	center	of	that	north	 pac 	 ific 	 	 gy 	 re 	 	.
so	,	to	make	the	point	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	built	 the 	 ir 	 	boat	out	of	plastic	trash	,	15,000	empty	water	 bottle 	 s 	 	 latch 	 ed 	 	together	 in 	 to 	 	two	 pontoon 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	going	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
 part 	 ly 	 	,	they	'd	had	a	bit	of	a	delay	.
they	'd	had	to	pull	in	at	catalina	 is 	 land 	 	 short 	 ly 	 	after	they	left	long	beach	 be 	 cause 	 	the	lids	of	all	the	water	 bottle 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	 un 	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	sink	.
so	they	'd	had	to	pull	in	and	do	all	the	lids	up	.
but	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 approach 	 ing 	 	the	end	of	my	water	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	,	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	our	 course 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 converg 	 ing 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	running	out	of	food	;	i	was	running	out	of	water	.
so	we	 lia 	 is 	 ed 	 	by	satellite	phone	and	 arrange 	 d 	 	to	meet	up	.
and	it	took	about	a	week	for	us	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 converg 	 e 	 	.
i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 pathetic 	 ally 	 	 s 	 low 	 	speed	of	about	1.3	 knot 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 marginal 	 ly 	 	less	pathetic	speed	of	about	1.4	:	it	was	like	two	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	in	a	 mat 	 ing 	 	dance	.
but	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	we	did	manage	to	meet	up	and	joel	hopped	 over 	 board 	 	,	caught	us	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	big	mahi	-	mahi	,	which	was	the	best	food	i	'd	had	in	,	ooh	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	three	 month 	 s 	 	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	one	that	he	caught	that	day	was	better	than	 th 	 is 	 	one	they	caught	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
when	they	 open 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	up	,	they	found	 it 	 s 	 	stomach	was	full	of	plastic	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	news	 be 	 cause 	 	plastic	is	not	an	 in 	 ert 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 	.
it	 le 	 ache 	 s 	 	out	 chemical 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 fl 	 esh 	 	of	the	poor	critter	that	ate	it	,	and	then	we	come	 a 	 long 	 	and	eat	that	poor	critter	,	and	we	get	some	of	the	 toxin 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ating 	 	in	our	bodies	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	real	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	human	health	.
i	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	made	it	to	hawaii	still	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	,	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	year	,	set	out	on	the	second	stage	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	from	hawaii	down	to	tarawa	.
and	you	'll	notice	 some 	 thing 	 	about	tarawa	;	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	 ly 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	that	little	green	 s 	 liver 	 	on	the	horizon	,	which	 make 	 s 	 	them	 ver 	 y 	 	nervous	about	 ris 	 ing 	 	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	big	trouble	for	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
they	've	got	no	 point 	 s 	 	of	land	more	than	about	six	feet	above	sea	level	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 extrem 	 e 	 	weather	 event 	 s 	 	due	to	climate	change	,	they	're	 expect 	 ing 	 	more	 wave 	 s 	 	to	come	in	over	the	 fr 	 ing 	 ing 	 	reef	,	which	will	 contami 	 n 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	fresh	water	supply	.
i	had	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	the	 p 	 resident 	 	there	,	who	told	me	about	his	exit	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	for	his	country	.
he	 expect 	 s 	 	that	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	100,000	people	that	live	there	will	have	to	 re 	 locate 	 	to	new	zealand	or	australia	.
and	that	made	me	think	about	how	would	i	feel	if	britain	was	going	to	disappear	under	the	 wave 	 s 	 	;	if	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	born	and	gone	to	school	and	got	married	,	if	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	going	to	disappear	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
how	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 un 	 ground 	 ed 	 	that	would	make	me	feel	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 short 	 ly 	 	,	i	'll	be	setting	out	to	try	and	get	to	australia	,	and	if	i	'm	 success 	 ful 	 	,	i	'll	be	the	first	woman	ever	to	row	 s 	 olo 	 	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
and	i	try	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	to	these	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	human	face	to	the	ocean	.
if	the	atlantic	was	about	my	inner	journey	,	 discover 	 ing 	 	my	own	 cap 	 abilities 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	about	my	 out 	 er 	 	journey	,	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	i	can	use	my	 interest 	 ing 	 	 care 	 er 	 	choice	to	be	of	service	to	the	world	,	and	to	take	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	out	there	and	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	 human 	 kind 	 	now	 find 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	.
i	think	there	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	three	key	 point 	 s 	 	here	.
the	first	one	is	about	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	we	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
for	so	long	,	i	told	 my 	 self 	 	that	i	could	n't	have	an	adventure	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	n't	six	foot	tall	and	athletic	and	 beard 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	that	story	 change 	 d 	 	.
i	found	out	that	people	had	 row 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
i	even	met	one	of	them	and	she	was	just	about	my	 s 	 ize 	 	.
so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	did	n't	grow	any	 tall 	 er 	 	,	i	did	n't	sprout	a	beard	,	 some 	 thing 	 	had	 change 	 d 	 	:	my	 in 	 terior 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	had	 change 	 d 	 	.
at	the	moment	,	the	story	that	we	 collect 	 ively 	 	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	is	that	we	need	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	that	we	need	oil	.
but	what	about	if	we	just	change	that	story	?
we	do	have	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	the	power	of	free	will	to	 choos 	 e 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	to	create	a	 green 	 er 	 	future	.
the	second	point	is	about	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	 action 	 s 	 	.
we	might	think	that	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	do	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	is	just	a	drop	in	the	ocean	,	that	it	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	.	 general 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	n't	got	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mess	through	big	 disaster 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	exxon	valdezes	and	the	chernobyls	,	but	 most 	 ly 	 	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	bad	 decision 	 s 	 	by	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	,	day	after	day	and	year	after	year	.
and	,	by	the	same	 to 	 ken 	 	,	we	can	turn	that	tide	.
we	can	start	making	better	,	 wis 	 er 	 	,	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	.
and	when	we	do	that	,	we	're	not	just	one	person	.
 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	do	 spread 	 s 	 	 ripple 	 s 	 	.
other	people	will	see	if	you	're	in	the	 super 	 market 	 	line	and	you	pull	out	your	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	 grocer 	 y 	 	bag	.
 may 	 be 	 	if	we	all	start	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	can	make	it	 social 	 ly 	 	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	to	say	 y 	 es 	 	to	plastic	in	the	 check 	 out 	 	line	.
that	's	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	world	-	wide	community	.
the	other	point	:	it	's	about	taking	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
for	so	much	of	my	life	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	to	make	me	happy	.
i	thought	if	i	had	the	right	house	or	the	right	car	or	the	right	man	in	my	life	,	then	i	could	be	happy	.
but	when	i	wrote	that	 o 	 bit 	 uary 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	grew	up	a	little	bit	in	that	moment	and	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	create	my	own	future	.
i	could	n't	just	wait	 pass 	 ively 	 	for	happiness	to	come	and	find	me	.
and	i	suppose	i	'm	a	 self 	 ish 	 	 environment 	 alist 	 	.
i	plan	on	 be 	 ing 	 	around	for	a	long	time	,	and	when	i	'm	90	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	want	to	be	happy	and	 health 	 y 	 	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	be	happy	on	a	planet	that	's	 rack 	 ed 	 	with	famine	and	drought	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	on	a	planet	where	we	've	 poison 	 ed 	 	the	earth	and	the	sea	and	the	air	.
so	,	 short 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	be	 launch 	 ing 	 	a	new	 initi 	 ative 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	eco	-	heroes	.
and	the	idea	here	is	that	all	our	eco	-	heroes	will	log	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	green	 de 	 ed 	 	every	day	.
it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	a	bit	of	a	game	.
we	're	going	to	make	an	iphone	app	out	of	it	.
we	just	want	to	try	and	create	that	 aware 	 ness 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 	,	changing	a	light	bulb	is	n't	going	to	change	the	world	,	but	that	attitude	,	that	 aware 	 ness 	 	that	 lead 	 s 	 	you	to	change	the	light	bulb	or	take	your	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	coffee	mug	,	that	is	what	could	change	the	world	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	stand	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	point	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	have	a	choice	.	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 bless 	 ed 	 	,	or	 cur 	 s 	 ed 	 	,	with	free	will	.
we	can	 choos 	 e 	 	a	 green 	 er 	 	future	,	and	we	can	get	there	if	we	all	pull	together	to	take	it	one	stroke	at	a	time	.
thank	you	.
