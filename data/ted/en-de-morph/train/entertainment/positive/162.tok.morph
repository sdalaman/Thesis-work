i	would	like	to	tell	you	about	a	project	which	i	 start 	 ed 	 	about	16	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	it	's	about	making	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	life	.
and	these	are	made	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	tube	--	 electric 	 ity 	 	tube	,	we	call	it	in	holland	.
and	we	can	start	a	film	about	that	,	and	we	can	see	a	little	bit	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	in	time	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	these	 beast 	 s 	 	are	going	to	live	in	 herd 	 s 	 	on	the	 beach 	 es 	 	.
theo	jansen	is	 work 	 ing 	 	hard	on	 th 	 is 	 	evolution	.
theo	jansen	:	i	want	to	put	these	 form 	 s 	 	of	life	on	the	 beach 	 es 	 	.
and	they	should	 surviv 	 e 	 	over	there	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	,	in	the	future	.
 learn 	 ing 	 	to	live	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	--	and	it	'll	take	couple	of	more	 year 	 s 	 	to	let	them	walk	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 beast 	 s 	 	will	not	get	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	from	food	,	but	from	the	wind	.
the	wind	will	move	 feather 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	back	,	which	will	drive	 the 	 ir 	 	feet	.
the	beast	 walk 	 s 	 	 side 	 ways 	 	on	the	wet	sand	of	the	beach	,	with	 it 	 s 	 	nose	 point 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	wind	.
 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	it	 walk 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	either	the	 roll 	 ing 	 	surf	or	the	dry	sand	,	it	 stop 	 s 	 	,	and	 walk 	 s 	 	in	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	direction	.
evolution	 ha 	 s 	 	generated	 man 	 y 	 	species	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	animaris	currens	ventosa	.
tj	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	herd	,	and	it	is	built	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 genetic 	 al 	 	 code 	 s 	 	.
and	it	is	a	sort	of	race	,	and	each	and	every	animal	is	different	,	and	the	winning	 code 	 s 	 	will	 multi 	 ply 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	wave	,	going	from	left	to	right	.	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
and	now	it	 go 	 es 	 	from	--	 y 	 es 	 	,	now	it	 go 	 es 	 	from	left	to	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	generation	,	a	new	family	,	which	is	able	to	store	the	 wind 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	 wing 	 s 	 	pump	up	air	in	 lemon 	 ade 	 	 bottle 	 s 	 	,	which	are	on	top	of	that	.
and	they	can	use	that	energy	in	case	the	wind	 fall 	 s 	 	away	,	and	the	tide	is	coming	up	,	and	there	is	still	a	little	bit	of	energy	to	reach	the	 dune 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ave 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 drown 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
i	could	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	animal	.
thank	you	.
so	,	the	proportion	of	the	 tube 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	animal	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	 walk 	 ing 	 	.
there	are	11	 number 	 s 	 	,	which	i	call	the	11	holy	 number 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	 distance 	 s 	 	of	the	 tube 	 s 	 	which	make	it	walk	that	way	.
in	fact	,	it	's	a	new	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	wheel	.
it	 work 	 s 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	a	wheel	.
the	axis	of	a	wheel	is	 stay 	 ing 	 	on	the	same	level	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	hip	is	 stay 	 ing 	 	on	the	same	level	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	better	than	a	wheel	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	try	to	drive	with	your	 bi 	 cycle 	 	on	the	beach	,	you	will	notice	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	do	.
and	the	feet	just	step	over	the	sand	,	and	the	wheel	 ha 	 s 	 	to	touch	every	piece	of	the	ground	in	between	.
so	,	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	wheel	,	we	have	a	new	wheel	.	and	i	will	show	you	,	in	the	next	video	--	can	you	start	it	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	?	--	that	 ver 	 y 	 	heavy	 load 	 s 	 	can	be	 move 	 d 	 	.
there	's	a	guy	 push 	 ing 	 	there	,	 be 	 hind 	 	,	but	can	 al 	 so 	 	walk	on	the	wind	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
it	's	3.2	 ton 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	 store 	 d 	 	 wind 	 s 	 	in	the	 bottle 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 feel 	 er 	 	,	where	it	can	feel	 obstacle 	 s 	 	and	turn	around	.
and	that	stuff	,	you	see	,	is	going	to	it	the	other	way	.
can	i	have	the	 feel 	 er 	 	here	?
ok	.	good	.
so	,	they	have	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	all	the	 danger 	 s 	 	of	the	beach	,	and	one	of	the	big	 danger 	 s 	 	is	the	sea	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sea	.
and	it	must	feel	the	water	of	the	sea	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	water	 feel 	 er 	 	.
and	what	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	tube	.	it	 suck 	 s 	 	in	air	 normal 	 ly 	 	,	but	when	it	 swallow 	 s 	 	water	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	the	 resist 	 ance 	 	of	it	.
so	imagine	that	the	animal	is	 walk 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	sea	.
 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	it	 touch 	 es 	 	the	water	,	you	should	hear	a	sort	of	sound	of	running	air	.
 y 	 es 	 	!	so	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	feel	,	it	will	be	 drown 	 ed 	 	,	ok	?
here	,	we	have	the	brain	of	the	animal	.
in	fact	,	it	is	a	step	counter	,	and	it	 count 	 s 	 	the	 step 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 bin 	 ary 	 	step	counter	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	soon	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	the	sea	,	it	 change 	 s 	 	the	pattern	of	 zero 	 es 	 	and	 one 	 s 	 	here	,	and	it	 know 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	where	it	is	on	the	beach	.	so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	brain	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	,	well	,	there	's	the	sea	,	there	are	 dune 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	here	.
so	it	's	a	sort	of	 imagin 	 ation 	 	of	the	simple	world	of	the	beach	animal	.
thank	you	.
one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 ene 	 mies 	 	are	the	 storm 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	part	of	the	nose	of	the	animaris	percipiere	,	and	when	the	nose	is	 fix 	 ed 	 	--	of	the	animal	--	the	whole	animal	is	 fix 	 ed 	 	.
so	when	the	storm	is	coming	up	,	it	 drive 	 s 	 	a	pin	 in 	 to 	 	the	ground	.
and	the	nose	is	 fix 	 ed 	 	,	the	whole	animal	is	 fix 	 ed 	 	.
the	wind	may	turn	,	but	the	animal	will	turn	 al 	 ways 	 	 it 	 s 	 	nose	 in 	 to 	 	the	wind	.
now	,	 an 	 other 	 	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	these	 animal 	 s 	 	will	 surviv 	 e 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
i	still	have	to	help	them	a	lot	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
