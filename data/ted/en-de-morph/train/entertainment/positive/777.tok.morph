i	think	it	was	in	my	second	grade	that	i	was	caught	 draw 	 ing 	 	the	bust	of	a	 nud 	 e 	 	by	michelangelo	.
i	was	 s 	 ent 	 	straight	away	to	my	school	principal	,	and	my	school	principal	,	a	sweet	 n 	 un 	 	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	my	book	with	disgust	,	 flip 	 ped 	 	through	the	 page 	 s 	 	,	saw	all	the	 nud 	 es 	 	--	you	know	,	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	my	mother	draw	 nud 	 es 	 	and	i	'd	copy	her	--	and	the	 n 	 un 	 	 s 	 lap 	 ped 	 	me	on	my	face	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	sweet	jesus	,	 th 	 is 	 	kid	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	.	``
i	had	no	clue	what	she	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	but	it	was	convincing	 en 	 ough 	 	for	me	never	to	draw	 aga 	 in 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	grade	.
 thank 	 s 	 	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 caricatur 	 ing 	 	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	in	school	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	got	a	lot	of	 popular 	 ity 	 	.
i	do	n't	play	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	at	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	the	 fanci 	 est 	 	 gadget 	 s 	 	at	home	.
i	'm	not	on	top	of	the	class	.
so	for	me	,	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	sense	of	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
i	got	popular	,	but	i	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	i	'd	get	caught	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	what	i	did	was	i	 quick 	 ly 	 	put	together	a	collage	of	all	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	i	had	drawn	,	 glor 	 ified 	 	my	school	principal	,	put	him	right	on	top	,	and	 gift 	 ed 	 	it	to	him	.
he	had	a	good	laugh	at	the	other	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	put	it	up	on	the	notice	board	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	part	of	that	.
and	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	school	hero	.
all	my	 senior 	 s 	 	 k 	 new 	 	me	.	i	felt	 re 	 ally 	 	special	.
i	have	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	my	family	.
that	's	my	mother	.	i	love	her	to	bits	.
she	's	the	one	who	taught	me	how	to	draw	and	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	how	to	love	.
she	's	a	bit	of	a	 hip 	 pie 	 	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	say	that	,	``	but	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
the	rest	of	my	family	are	 bor 	 ing 	 	 academic 	 s 	 	,	 bus 	 y 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	 iv 	 y 	 	league	 dec 	 al 	 s 	 	for	our	classic	ambassador	car	.
my	father	's	a	little	different	.
my	father	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	a	 hol 	 istic 	 	approach	to	living	,	and	,	you	know	,	every	time	he	taught	us	,	he	'd	say	,	``	i	hate	these	 book 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 book 	 s 	 	are	 hijack 	 ed 	 	by	industrial	revolution	.	``
while	he	still	held	that	 world 	 view 	 	,	i	was	16	,	i	got	the	best	lawyer	in	town	,	my	 old 	 er 	 	brother	karthik	,	and	i	 s 	 at 	 	him	down	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	pa	,	from	 to 	 day 	 	 on 	 ward 	 s 	 	i	've	 decide 	 d 	 	i	'm	going	to	be	 discipline 	 d 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	be	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	new	every	day	,	i	'm	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	'm	not	going	to	depend	on	you	 emotion 	 ally 	 	or	 financial 	 ly 	 	.	``
and	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	.	he	was	all	 tear 	 ing 	 	up	.	ready	to	hug	me	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	hold	that	thought	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	can	i	quit	school	then	?	``
but	,	to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	i	quit	school	to	pursue	a	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	.
i	must	have	 d 	 one 	 	about	30,000	 caricatur 	 es 	 	.
i	would	do	 birth 	 day 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	,	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 divorce 	 s 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	use	my	 service 	 s 	 	.
but	,	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	while	i	was	 travel 	 ing 	 	,	i	taught	children	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	,	and	in	 ex 	 change 	 	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	be	 spontane 	 ous 	 	.
and	mad	and	crazy	and	 f 	 un 	 	.
when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	them	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	let	me	start	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 professional 	 ly 	 	.
when	i	was	18	i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	own	school	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	an	18	year	-	old	 try 	 ing 	 	to	start	a	school	is	not	easy	 un 	 less 	 	you	have	a	big	patron	or	a	big	 support 	 er 	 	.
so	i	was	 flip 	 ping 	 	through	the	 page 	 s 	 	of	the	 time 	 s 	 	of	india	when	i	saw	that	the	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	india	was	 visit 	 ing 	 	my	home	town	,	bangalore	.
and	,	you	know	,	just	like	how	every	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	 know 	 s 	 	bush	here	,	and	if	you	had	to	meet	bush	,	it	would	be	the	 f 	 un 	 nest 	 	thing	 be 	 cause 	 	his	face	was	a	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	's	 de 	 light 	 	.
i	had	to	meet	my	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	.
i	went	to	the	place	where	his	helicopter	was	about	to	land	.
i	saw	 layer 	 s 	 	of	security	.
i	 caricatur 	 ed 	 	my	way	through	three	 layer 	 s 	 	by	just	 impress 	 ing 	 	the	 guard 	 s 	 	,	but	i	got	 s 	 tuck 	 	.	i	got	 s 	 tuck 	 	at	the	third	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	to	my	luck	,	i	saw	a	nuclear	scientist	at	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	party	i	had	 d 	 one 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
i	ran	up	to	him	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 hell 	 o 	 	,	 s 	 ir 	 	.	how	do	you	do	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	here	,	raghava	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	here	to	meet	the	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	so	am	i.	``
i	hopped	 in 	 to 	 	his	car	,	and	off	we	went	through	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	of	security	.
thank	you	.
i	 s 	 at 	 	him	down	,	i	 caricatur 	 ed 	 	him	,	and	since	then	i	've	 caricatur 	 ed 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 celebr 	 ities 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	i	remember	 fond 	 ly 	 	.
salman	rushdie	was	 piss 	 ed 	 	-	off	i	think	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 alter 	 ed 	 	the	map	of	new	york	,	if	you	notice	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	the	next	slide	i	'm	about	to	show	you	--	should	i	just	turn	that	off	?
the	next	slide	i	'm	about	to	show	you	,	is	a	little	more	serious	.
i	was	 hesit 	 ant 	 	to	include	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	 present 	 ation 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cartoon	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	soon	after	9/11	.
what	was	,	for	me	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	naive	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	disaster	.
that	 even 	 ing 	 	,	i	came	home	to	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	hate	 mail 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	how	they	could	have	lived	 an 	 other 	 	day	 with 	 out 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	a	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	'	 organ 	 ization 	 	in	america	,	that	for	me	was	my	 life 	 line 	 	.
that	's	when	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	you	know	,	 cartoon 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	art	 come 	 s 	 	with	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	what	i	did	was	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	need	to	take	a	break	.
i	quit	my	job	at	the	 paper 	 s 	 	,	i	closed	my	school	,	and	i	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	my	 pencil 	 s 	 	and	my	 brush 	 es 	 	and	 ink 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	 travel 	 ing 	 	.
when	i	went	 travel 	 ing 	 	,	i	remember	,	i	met	 th 	 is 	 	fabulous	old	man	,	who	i	met	when	i	was	 caricatur 	 ing 	 	,	who	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	an	artist	,	in	italy	.
he	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	to	his	studio	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	come	and	visit	.	``
when	i	went	,	i	saw	the	 ghast 	 liest 	 	thing	ever	.
i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	dead	,	naked	effigy	of	 him 	 self 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	from	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	my	god	.	what	is	that	?	``
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	that	thing	?	in	the	night	,	i	die	.
in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	am	born	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
i	thought	he	was	 ko 	 o 	 	 ko 	 o 	 	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
i	 love 	 d 	 	it	.	i	thought	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	about	that	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	am	dead	,	so	i	need	to	be	born	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
so	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 paint 	 er 	 	like	him	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	how	to	paint	.
so	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	going	to	the	art	store	.
you	know	,	there	are	a	hundred	 type 	 s 	 	of	 brush 	 es 	 	.
forget	it	,	they	will	 con 	 fuse 	 	you	even	if	you	know	how	to	draw	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	learn	to	paint	by	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	clip	to	show	you	how	i	 paint 	 ed 	 	and	a	little	bit	about	my	city	,	bangalore	.
they	had	to	be	 large 	 r 	 	than	life	.
 every 	 thing 	 	had	to	be	 large 	 r 	 	.	the	next	 paint 	 ing 	 	was	even	 big 	 ger 	 	.
and	even	 big 	 ger 	 	.
and	for	me	it	was	,	i	had	to	dance	while	i	 paint 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	i	even	 start 	 ed 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	 danc 	 ers 	 	.
here	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	a	flamenco	 danc 	 er 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	there	was	one	problem	.
i	did	n't	know	the	dance	form	,	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	them	,	and	i	made	some	money	,	 s 	 old 	 	my	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	would	rush	off	to	france	or	spain	and	work	with	them	.
that	's	pepe	linares	,	the	 ren 	 owned 	 	flamenco	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	.
but	i	had	one	problem	,	my	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	never	 danc 	 ed 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	much	energy	 a 	 s 	 	i	put	 in 	 to 	 	them	while	making	them	,	they	never	 danc 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	--	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	 epiph 	 any 	 	at	two	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
i	 call 	 ed 	 	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 paint 	 ed 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	,	and	had	them	dance	in	front	of	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
and	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	my	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	came	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	then	i	was	fortunate	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	perform	 th 	 is 	 	in	california	with	 velo 	 city 	 	circus	.
and	i	 s 	 at 	 	like	you	 guy 	 s 	 	there	in	the	audience	.
and	i	saw	my	work	come	 al 	 ive 	 	.
you	know	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	you	work	in	 isol 	 ation 	 	,	and	you	show	at	a	 gall 	 ery 	 	,	but	here	,	the	work	was	coming	 al 	 ive 	 	,	and	it	had	some	other	 artist 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	me	.
the	 collabor 	 ative 	 	effort	was	fabulous	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	with	 any 	 body 	 	and	 every 	 body 	 	i	meet	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	fashion	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fashion	show	we	held	in	london	.
the	best	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	of	course	,	is	with	children	.
they	are	 ruth 	 less 	 	,	they	are	honest	,	but	they	're	full	of	energy	and	 f 	 un 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	work	,	a	library	i	designed	for	the	 rob 	 in 	 	hood	 found 	 ation 	 	.
and	i	must	say	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	time	in	the	bronx	 work 	 ing 	 	with	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	,	in	 ex 	 change 	 	for	me	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	,	they	taught	me	how	to	be	cool	.
i	do	n't	think	i	've	 succeed 	 ed 	 	,	but	they	've	taught	me	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	stop	 say 	 ing 	 	sorry	.	say	,	my	bad	.	``
then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	good	,	but	i	want	to	paint	like	a	real	 paint 	 er 	 	.
american	education	is	so	expensive	.
i	was	in	india	,	and	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	down	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	and	i	saw	a	 bill 	 board 	 	 paint 	 er 	 	.
and	these	 guy 	 s 	 	paint	 hum 	 ong 	 ous 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	look	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
and	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	how	they	did	it	from	so	close	.
so	,	one	day	i	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	meet	one	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	do	you	paint	like	that	?	who	taught	you	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	.	i	can	teach	you	,	but	we	're	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	city	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 bill 	 board 	 	 paint 	 ers 	 	are	a	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	extinct	bunch	of	 artist 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	digital	 print 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	them	and	 hijack 	 ed 	 	them	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	in	 ex 	 change 	 	for	education	in	how	to	paint	,	i	will	support	them	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	company	.
and	since	then	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	place	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	i	did	of	my	wife	in	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
and	,	in	fact	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	on	 any 	 thing 	 	,	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	them	around	town	.
since	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	my	wife	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	with	her	,	netra	.
netra	and	i	met	when	she	was	18	.
i	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	19	and	a	half	then	,	and	it	was	love	at	first	sight	.
i	lived	in	india	.	she	lived	in	america	.
she	'd	come	every	two	 month 	 s 	 	to	visit	me	,	and	then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	'm	the	man	,	i	'm	the	man	,	and	i	have	to	 reciproc 	 ate 	 	.
i	have	to	travel	seven	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	and	i	have	to	come	and	see	you	.
i	did	that	twice	,	and	i	went	broke	.
so	then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 net 	 s 	 	,	what	do	i	do	?	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	you	 s 	 end 	 	me	your	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	?
my	dad	 know 	 s 	 	a	bunch	of	rich	 guy 	 s 	 	.
we	'll	try	and	con	them	 in 	 to 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	then	...	``
but	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	after	i	 s 	 ent 	 	the	 work 	 s 	 	to	her	,	that	her	dad	's	 friend 	 s 	 	,	like	most	of	you	,	are	 geek 	 s 	 	.

no	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 geek 	 s 	 	,	and	they	did	n't	know	much	about	art	.
so	netra	was	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	30	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	mine	.
so	what	we	did	was	we	 rent 	 ed 	 	a	little	van	and	we	drove	all	over	the	east	coast	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	it	.
she	 contact 	 ed 	 	 any 	 one 	 	and	 every 	 one 	 	who	was	 will 	 ing 	 	to	buy	my	work	.
she	made	 en 	 ough 	 	money	,	she	 s 	 old 	 	off	the	whole	 collect 	 ion 	 	and	made	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	move	me	for	four	 year 	 s 	 	with	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	a	company	,	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	she	 be 	 came 	 	my	 manage 	 r 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	all	the	press	we	got	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	time	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	best	way	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	is	to	marry	netra	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	get	married	.	``

i	love	my	mother	and	i	was	told	all	of	a	sudden	that	she	was	going	to	die	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	you	have	to	say	bye	to	her	,	you	have	to	do	what	you	have	to	do	.
and	i	was	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	.
i	had	 show 	 s 	 	 book 	 ed 	 	up	for	 an 	 other 	 	year	.
i	was	on	a	high	.
and	i	could	n't	.	i	could	not	.
my	life	was	not	 ex 	 uber 	 ant 	 	.
i	could	not	live	 th 	 is 	 	 large 	 r 	 	than	life	person	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	 dark 	 er 	 	 abscess 	 es 	 	of	the	human	mind	.
of	course	,	my	work	 turn 	 ed 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	but	 an 	 other 	 	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	lost	all	my	 audience 	 s 	 	.
the	bollywood	 star 	 s 	 	who	i	would	party	with	and	buy	my	work	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
the	 collect 	 ors 	 	,	the	 friend 	 s 	 	,	the	press	,	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	nice	,	but	thank	you	.	``
``	no	thank	you	,	``	was	more	like	it	.
but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	people	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	my	work	from	 the 	 ir 	 	gut	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 paint 	 ing 	 	it	from	my	gut	.
if	they	 want 	 ed 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	i	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	give	you	.	it	's	 politic 	 ized 	 	.
of	course	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 like 	 d 	 	it	.
my	 work 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	dear	friend	of	mine	came	out	of	the	 close 	 t 	 	,	and	in	india	at	that	time	,	it	was	 il 	 legal 	 	to	be	 ga 	 y 	 	,	and	it	's	 disgust 	 ing 	 	to	see	how	people	respond	to	a	 ga 	 y 	 	person	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	.
i	remember	the	time	when	my	mother	used	to	dress	me	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	little	girl	--	that	's	me	there	--	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 want 	 ed 	 	a	girl	,	and	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	what	my	 friend 	 s 	 	are	going	to	say	after	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
it	's	a	secret	.
so	,	after	 th 	 is 	 	,	my	 work 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	a	little	violent	.
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 mascu 	 lin 	 ity 	 	that	one	need	not	perform	.
and	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 weak 	 ness 	 	of	male	 sexual 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	my	 collect 	 ors 	 	disappear	,	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 activist 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	ban	me	and	to	threaten	me	and	to	forbid	me	from	 show 	 ing 	 	.
it	 turn 	 ed 	 	nasty	,	and	i	'm	a	bit	of	a	chicken	.
i	ca	n't	deal	with	any	threat	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	big	threat	.
so	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	it	was	time	to	end	and	go	back	home	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	i	 s 	 aid 	 	let	's	try	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
i	need	to	be	 re 	 born 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	i	thought	the	best	way	,	 a 	 s 	 	most	of	you	know	who	have	children	,	the	best	way	to	have	a	new	lease	on	life	,	is	to	have	a	child	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	have	a	child	,	and	before	i	did	that	,	i	 quick 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	what	can	go	wrong	.
how	can	a	family	get	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	?
and	rudra	was	born	.
that	's	my	little	son	.
and	two	 magic 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	after	he	was	born	.

you	know	i	 s 	 at 	 	at	home	and	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	.
i	 tear 	 ed 	 	up	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	's	where	i	want	to	be	.
so	netra	and	i	wound	up	our	life	,	closed	up	 every 	 thing 	 	we	had	,	and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	move	to	new	york	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	just	eight	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	 move 	 d 	 	back	to	new	york	,	my	work	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.

you	know	,	i	may	appear	to	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	,	clean	,	sweet	boy	.
but	i	'm	not	.	i	'm	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
