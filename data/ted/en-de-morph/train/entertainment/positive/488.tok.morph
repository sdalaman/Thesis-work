about	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	new	yorker	 publish 	 ed 	 	an	article	about	a	cache	of	 do 	 do 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	that	was	found	in	a	pit	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	mauritius	.
now	,	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	mauritius	is	a	small	 is 	 land 	 	off	the	east	coast	of	madagascar	in	the	indian	ocean	,	and	it	is	the	place	where	the	 do 	 do 	 	bird	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	and	 extingu 	 ish 	 ed 	 	,	all	 with 	 in 	 	about	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 archaeo 	 logical 	 	find	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 me 	 ant 	 	that	they	might	 final 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	assemble	a	single	 do 	 do 	 	skeleton	.
see	,	while	 museum 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	have	 do 	 do 	 	 skeleton 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	,	 no 	 body 	 	--	not	even	the	actual	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	museum	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	mauritius	--	 ha 	 s 	 	a	skeleton	that	's	made	from	the	 bone 	 s 	 	of	a	single	 do 	 do 	 	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	true	.
the	fact	is	,	is	that	the	british	museum	had	a	complete	specimen	of	a	 do 	 do 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	up	 un 	 til 	 	the	18th	century	--	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mum 	 m 	 ified 	 	,	skin	and	all	--	but	in	a	fit	of	space	-	saving	zeal	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	cut	off	the	head	and	they	cut	off	the	feet	and	they	 burn 	 ed 	 	the	rest	in	a	 bon 	 fire 	 	.
if	you	go	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	they	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	list	these	 specimen 	 s 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	the	rest	was	lost	in	a	fire	.
not	 quit 	 e 	 	the	whole	truth	.	 any 	 way 	 	.
the	 front 	 is 	 piece 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	article	was	 th 	 is 	 	photo	,	and	i	'm	one	of	the	people	that	 think 	 s 	 	that	tina	 brow 	 n 	 	was	great	for	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	to	the	new	yorker	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	photo	 complete 	 ly 	 	 rock 	 ed 	 	my	world	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	the	object	--	not	just	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	photograph	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	the	color	,	the	 sh 	 allow 	 	depth	of	field	,	the	detail	that	's	visible	,	the	wire	you	can	see	on	the	beak	there	that	the	 conserv 	 ator 	 	used	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	skeleton	together	--	there	's	an	entire	story	here	.
and	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	would	n't	it	be	great	if	i	had	my	own	 do 	 do 	 	skeleton	?
i	want	to	point	out	here	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	that	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	my	life	 obsess 	 ed 	 	by	 object 	 s 	 	and	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	they	tell	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 lat 	 est 	 	one	.
so	i	 beg 	 an 	 	looking	around	for	--	to	see	if	 any 	 one 	 	 s 	 old 	 	a	kit	,	some	kind	of	model	that	i	could	get	,	and	i	found	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ference 	 	material	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 love 	 ly 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	.
no	 d 	 ice 	 	:	no	 do 	 do 	 	skeleton	for	me	.	but	the	damage	had	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
i	had	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	a	few	hundred	 photo 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 do 	 	 skeleton 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	``	creative	 project 	 s 	 	``	 fold 	 er 	 	--	it	's	a	 re 	 posit 	 ory 	 	for	my	brain	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	could	possibly	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
any	time	i	have	an	 inter 	 net 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	there	's	a	 s 	 lu 	 ice 	 	of	stuff	moving	 in 	 to 	 	there	,	 every 	 thing 	 	from	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 ring 	 s 	 	to	 cock 	 pit 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	 fold 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	17,000	 photo 	 s 	 	--	over	20	 gigabyte 	 s 	 	of	information	--	and	it	's	growing	 constant 	 ly 	 	.
and	one	day	,	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	 may 	 be 	 	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	was	in	the	art	store	with	my	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	 buy 	 ing 	 	some	clay	 tool 	 s 	 	--	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	have	a	craft	day	.
i	 b 	 ought 	 	some	super	sculpeys	,	some	 ar 	 mature 	 	wire	,	some	 vari 	 ous 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	down	at	 th 	 is 	 	sculpey	,	and	i	thought	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	could	make	my	own	 do 	 do 	 	skull	.
i	should	point	out	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	--	i	'm	not	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	;	i	'm	a	hard	-	 ed 	 ged 	 	model	maker	.
you	give	me	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	you	give	me	a	prop	to	replicate	,	you	give	me	a	 cr 	 ane 	 	,	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	,	 part 	 s 	 	from	``	star	 war 	 s 	 	``	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 part 	 s 	 	from	``	star	 war 	 s 	 	``	--	i	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	all	day	long	.
it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	i	made	my	living	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	you	give	me	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	my	friend	 mi 	 ke 	 	murnane	 sculpt 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	;	it	's	a	maquette	for	``	star	 war 	 s 	 	,	episode	two	``	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	my	thing	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	other	people	do	--	 dragon 	 s 	 	,	soft	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	felt	like	i	had	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 en 	 ough 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 do 	 	 skull 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	understand	the	 top 	 ology 	 	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	replicate	it	--	i	mean	,	it	could	n't	be	that	difficult	.
so	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	the	best	 photo 	 s 	 	i	could	find	.
i	 grab 	 bed 	 	all	the	 re 	 ference 	 	,	and	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	piece	of	 re 	 ference 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 one 	 	selling	 th 	 is 	 	on	ebay	;	it	was	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	woman	's	hand	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	a	woman	's	hand	.
 assum 	 ing 	 	it	was	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	my	wife	's	hand	,	i	made	some	 measure 	 ments 	 	of	her	thumb	,	and	i	 scale 	 d 	 	them	out	to	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	skull	.
i	 ble 	 w 	 	it	up	to	the	actual	 s 	 ize 	 	,	and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	using	that	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	all	the	other	 re 	 ference 	 	that	i	had	,	 compar 	 ing 	 	it	to	it	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	 re 	 ference 	 	for	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	big	the	beak	should	be	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	long	,	etc	.
and	over	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	,	i	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	what	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 reason 	 able 	 	 do 	 do 	 	skull	.	and	i	did	n't	mean	to	 continu 	 e 	 	,	i	--	it	's	kind	of	like	,	you	know	,	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	clean	a	super	 mess 	 y 	 	room	by	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	one	thing	at	a	time	;	you	ca	n't	think	about	the	 total 	 ity 	 	.
i	was	n't	 think 	 ing 	 	about	a	 do 	 do 	 	skeleton	;	i	just	 notice 	 d 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	skull	,	the	 ar 	 mature 	 	wire	that	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	used	to	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	up	was	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	of	the	back	just	where	a	 s 	 pine 	 	would	be	.
and	one	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	and	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	is	 spin 	 es 	 	and	 skeleton 	 s 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	hundred	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	of	 vertebra 	 e 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	kind	of	start	to	 imit 	 ate 	 	them	.
and	so	button	by	button	,	 vertebra 	 e 	 	by	 vertebra 	 e 	 	,	i	built	my	way	down	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	by	the	end	of	the	day	,	i	had	a	 reason 	 able 	 	skull	,	a	 moderate 	 ly 	 	good	 vertebra 	 e 	 	and	half	of	a	 pel 	 vis 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	going	,	looking	for	more	 re 	 ference 	 	,	every	bit	of	 re 	 ference 	 	i	could	find	--	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	--	i	love	 th 	 is 	 	guy	!	he	put	a	 do 	 do 	 	leg	 bone 	 s 	 	on	a	scanner	with	a	 rul 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	 accu 	 racy 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	,	 replicate 	 d 	 	every	last	bone	and	put	it	in	.
and	after	about	six	 week 	 s 	 	,	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	 paint 	 ed 	 	,	 mount 	 ed 	 	my	own	 do 	 do 	 	skeleton	.
you	can	see	that	i	even	made	a	museum	label	for	it	that	 include 	 s 	 	a	brief	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 do 	 do 	 	.
and	tap	 plastic 	 s 	 	made	me	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	did	n't	photograph	it	--	a	museum	 vi 	 tri 	 ne 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	the	room	for	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	house	,	but	i	had	to	finish	what	i	had	 start 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	kind	of	a	sea	change	to	me	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	my	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	 object 	 s 	 	and	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	they	tell	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	making	them	for	 my 	 self 	 	,	 obtain 	 ing 	 	them	,	 appreci 	 ating 	 	them	and	 div 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	them	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 fold 	 er 	 	,	``	creative	 project 	 s 	 	,	``	there	are	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 current 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	 project 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	on	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	might	want	to	work	on	some	day	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	may	just	want	to	find	and	buy	and	have	and	look	at	and	touch	.
but	now	there	was	 potential 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	 categor 	 y 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	could	sculpt	that	was	different	,	that	i	--	you	know	,	i	have	my	own	r	2d2	,	but	that	's	--	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	 sculpt 	 ing 	 	,	to	me	,	that	's	easy	.
and	so	i	went	back	and	 look 	 ed 	 	through	my	``	creative	 project 	 s 	 	``	 fold 	 er 	 	,	and	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	maltese	falcon	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	funny	for	me	:	to	fall	in	love	with	an	object	from	a	hammett	novel	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	it	's	true	that	the	world	is	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	people	,	chandler	people	and	hammett	people	,	i	am	 absolute 	 ly 	 	a	chandler	person	.
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	it	's	not	about	the	author	,	it	's	not	about	the	book	or	the	movie	or	the	story	,	it	's	about	the	object	in	and	of	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	--	 play 	 s 	 	on	a	host	of	 level 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	there	's	the	object	in	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	``	kniphausen	hawk	.	``
it	is	a	 ceremoni 	 al 	 	 pour 	 ing 	 	vessel	made	around	1700	for	a	swedish	count	,	and	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	the	object	from	which	hammett	drew	his	inspiration	for	the	maltese	falcon	.
then	there	is	the	 fiction 	 al 	 	bird	,	the	one	that	hammett	 create 	 d 	 	for	the	book	.
built	out	of	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	is	the	engine	that	 drive 	 s 	 	the	plot	of	his	book	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	movie	,	in	which	 an 	 other 	 	object	is	 create 	 d 	 	:	a	prop	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	represent	the	thing	that	hammett	 create 	 d 	 	out	of	 word 	 s 	 	,	inspired	by	the	kniphausen	hawk	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	the	falcon	in	the	movie	.
and	then	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	fourth	level	,	which	is	a	whole	new	object	in	the	world	:	the	prop	made	for	the	movie	,	the	 represent 	 ative 	 	of	the	thing	,	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	,	in	 it 	 s 	 	own	right	,	a	whole	other	thing	,	a	whole	new	object	of	 desir 	 e 	 	.
and	so	now	it	was	time	to	do	some	research	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 d 	 one 	 	some	research	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	before	--	it	's	why	the	 fold 	 er 	 	was	there	.
i	'd	 b 	 ought 	 	a	replica	,	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 crap 	 py 	 	replica	,	of	the	maltese	falcon	on	ebay	,	and	had	 download 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	some	 reason 	 able 	 	 re 	 ference 	 	.
but	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	in	 research 	 ing 	 	further	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ing 	 	precise	 re 	 ference 	 	,	that	one	of	the	original	lead	 bird 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 old 	 	at	christie	's	in	1994	,	and	so	i	 contact 	 ed 	 	an	 anti 	 quar 	 ian 	 	 book 	 seller 	 	who	had	the	original	christie	's	 catalog 	 ue 	 	,	and	in	it	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	 magnific 	 ent 	 	picture	,	which	 include 	 d 	 	a	 s 	 ize 	 	 re 	 ference 	 	.
i	was	able	to	 s 	 can 	 	the	picture	,	blow	it	up	to	 exact 	 ly 	 	full	 s 	 ize 	 	.
i	found	other	 re 	 ference 	 	.	avi	[	ara	]	chekmayan	,	a	new	jersey	editor	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 s 	 in 	 	maltese	falcon	at	a	flea	market	in	1991	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	took	him	five	 year 	 s 	 	to	 authentic 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	bird	to	the	 auction 	 e 	 ers 	 	'	 specific 	 ations 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	a	lot	of	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	about	it	.
it	was	made	out	of	 re 	 s 	 in 	 	,	which	was	n't	a	common	material	for	movie	 prop 	 s 	 	about	the	time	the	movie	was	made	.
it	's	funny	to	me	that	it	took	a	while	to	 authentic 	 ate 	 	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	can	see	it	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	and	i	can	tell	you	--	it	's	real	,	it	's	the	real	thing	,	it	's	made	from	the	exact	same	mold	that	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	auction	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	so	controversial	,	 profile 	 s 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	the	auction	house	that	 s 	 old 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	think	in	1995	for	about	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 include 	 d 	 	--	you	can	see	here	on	the	bottom	--	not	just	a	front	 elev 	 ation 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	side	,	rear	and	other	side	 elev 	 ation 	 	.
so	now	,	i	had	all	the	 top 	 ology 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	replicate	the	maltese	falcon	.
what	do	they	do	,	how	do	you	start	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	?	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	know	.
so	what	i	did	was	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	like	i	did	with	the	 do 	 do 	 	skull	,	i	 ble 	 w 	 	all	my	 re 	 ference 	 	up	to	full	 s 	 ize 	 	,	and	then	i	 beg 	 an 	 	cutting	out	the	 negative 	 s 	 	and	using	 t 	 hose 	 	 template 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	shape	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	.
so	i	took	sculpey	,	and	i	built	a	big	block	of	it	,	and	i	 pass 	 ed 	 	it	through	 un 	 til 	 	,	you	know	,	i	got	the	right	 profile 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	feather	by	feather	,	detail	by	detail	,	i	 work 	 ed 	 	out	and	 achiev 	 ed 	 	--	 work 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	super	sculpey	--	here	's	me	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	my	wife	--	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	picture	i	took	of	the	entire	process	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 move 	 d 	 	through	,	i	 achiev 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 reason 	 able 	 	 facsi 	 mile 	 	of	the	maltese	falcon	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	am	not	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	,	and	so	i	do	n't	know	a	lot	of	the	 trick 	 s 	 	,	like	,	i	do	n't	know	how	my	friend	 mi 	 ke 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 shin 	 y 	 	 surface 	 s 	 	with	his	sculpey	;	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	was	n't	able	to	get	it	.
so	,	i	went	down	to	my	shop	,	and	i	 mold 	 ed 	 	it	and	i	cast	it	in	 re 	 s 	 in 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	 re 	 s 	 in 	 	,	then	,	i	could	 absolute 	 ly 	 	get	the	glass	smooth	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
now	there	's	a	lot	of	ways	to	fill	and	get	 your 	 self 	 	a	nice	smooth	finish	.
my	 pre 	 ference 	 	is	about	70	 coat 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	 ma 	 tte 	 	black	auto	 prim 	 er 	 	.
i	spray	it	on	for	about	three	or	four	 day 	 s 	 	,	it	 drip 	 s 	 	to	hell	,	but	it	 allow 	 s 	 	me	a	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	gentle	 sand 	 ing 	 	surface	and	i	can	get	it	glass	-	smooth	.
oh	,	 finish 	 ing 	 	up	with	triple	-	zero	steel	wool	.
now	,	the	great	thing	about	 get 	 ting 	 	it	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	was	that	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	movie	,	when	they	 final 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	out	the	bird	at	the	end	,	and	they	place	it	on	the	table	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	spin	it	.
so	i	was	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	screen	-	shot	and	freeze	-	frame	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	.
and	i	'm	 follow 	 ing 	 	all	the	light	 kick 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	thing	and	making	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	light	in	the	same	position	,	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	the	same	type	of	 reflect 	 ion 	 	on	it	--	that	's	the	level	of	detail	i	'm	going	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	:	my	maltese	falcon	.
and	it	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.	and	i	can	state	with	 author 	 ity 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	time	,	when	i	'd	 finish 	 ed 	 	it	,	of	all	of	the	 replica 	 s 	 	out	there	--	and	there	is	a	few	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	by	far	the	most	accurate	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	the	original	maltese	falcon	than	 any 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 sculpt 	 ed 	 	.	now	the	original	one	,	i	should	tell	you	,	is	 sculpt 	 ed 	 	by	a	guy	named	fred	sexton	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	it	 get 	 s 	 	weird	.
fred	sexton	was	a	friend	of	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	george	hodel	.
 terrify 	 ing 	 	guy	--	 agree 	 d 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	to	be	the	killer	of	the	black	dahlia	.
now	,	james	ellroy	 believ 	 es 	 	that	fred	sexton	,	the	 sculpt 	 or 	 	of	the	maltese	falcon	,	 kill 	 ed 	 	james	elroy	's	mother	.
i	'll	go	you	one	 strange 	 r 	 	than	that	:	in	1974	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	production	of	a	weird	 come 	 dy 	 	 s 	 equ 	 el 	 	to	``	the	maltese	falcon	,	``	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	black	bird	,	``	 star 	 ring 	 	george	segal	,	the	los	angeles	 count 	 y 	 	museum	of	art	had	a	 plast 	 er 	 	original	of	the	maltese	falcon	--	one	of	the	original	six	 plast 	 ers 	 	,	i	think	,	made	for	the	movie	--	 stole 	 n 	 	out	of	the	museum	.	a	lot	of	people	thought	it	was	a	 public 	 ity 	 	stunt	for	the	movie	.
john	's	grill	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	 s 	 een 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	in	``	the	maltese	falcon	,	``	is	still	a	 vi 	 able 	 	san	francisco	 eater 	 y 	 	,	 count 	 ed 	 	 among 	 st 	 	 it 	 s 	 	regular	 custom 	 ers 	 	elisha	cook	,	who	 play 	 ed 	 	wilmer	cook	in	the	movie	,	and	he	 g 	 ave 	 	them	one	of	his	original	 plast 	 ers 	 	of	the	maltese	falcon	.
and	they	had	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	cabinet	for	about	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	got	 stole 	 n 	 	in	january	of	2007	.
it	would	seem	that	the	object	of	 desir 	 e 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	by	 disappear 	 ing 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	.
so	here	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	falcon	,	and	it	was	 love 	 ly 	 	.	it	 look 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	great	,	the	light	 work 	 ed 	 	on	it	 re 	 ally 	 	well	,	it	was	better	than	 any 	 thing 	 	that	i	could	 achiev 	 e 	 	or	obtain	out	in	the	world	.
but	there	was	a	problem	.	and	the	problem	was	that	:	i	 want 	 ed 	 	the	 entire 	 ty 	 	of	the	object	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	the	weight	 be 	 hind 	 	the	object	.
 th 	 is 	 	thing	was	made	of	 re 	 s 	 in 	 	and	it	was	too	light	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	group	 on 	 line 	 	that	i	frequent	.
it	's	a	group	of	prop	 crazi 	 es 	 	just	like	me	 call 	 ed 	 	the	replica	 prop 	 s 	 	forum	,	and	it	's	people	who	trade	,	make	and	travel	in	information	about	movie	 prop 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	one	of	the	 guy 	 s 	 	there	,	a	friend	of	mine	that	i	never	 actual 	 ly 	 	met	,	but	 be 	 friend 	 ed 	 	through	some	prop	 deal 	 s 	 	,	was	the	 manage 	 r 	 	of	a	local	 found 	 ry 	 	.
he	took	my	master	falcon	pattern	,	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	lost	wax	 cast 	 ing 	 	in	 bron 	 ze 	 	for	me	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 bron 	 ze 	 	i	got	back	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	after	some	acid	 etch 	 ing 	 	,	the	one	that	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	it	's	 deep 	 ly 	 	,	 deep 	 ly 	 	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
here	,	i	'm	going	to	put	it	out	there	,	 lat 	 er 	 	on	 to 	 night 	 	,	and	i	want	you	to	pick	it	up	and	handle	it	.
you	want	to	know	how	 obsess 	 ed 	 	i	am	.	 th 	 is 	 	project	's	 on 	 ly 	 	for	me	,	and	yet	i	went	so	far	 a 	 s 	 	to	buy	on	ebay	a	1941	chinese	san	francisco	-	based	 news 	 paper 	 	,	in	order	so	that	the	bird	could	 proper 	 ly 	 	be	 wrap 	 ped 	 	...
like	it	is	in	the	movie	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	know	!
there	you	can	see	,	it	's	 weigh 	 ing 	 	in	at	27	and	a	half	 pound 	 s 	 	.
that	's	half	the	weight	of	my	dog	,	huxley	.
but	there	's	a	problem	.
now	,	here	's	the	most	 re 	 cent 	 	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	 falcon 	 s 	 	.
on	the	far	left	is	a	piece	of	crap	--	a	replica	i	 b 	 ought 	 	on	ebay	.
there	's	my	 some 	 what 	 	 ruin 	 ed 	 	sculpey	falcon	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	to	get	it	back	out	of	the	mold	.	there	's	my	first	 cast 	 ing 	 	,	there	's	my	master	and	there	's	my	 bron 	 ze 	 	.
there	's	a	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	mold	and	cast	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	is	that	every	time	you	throw	it	 in 	 to 	 	 silicon 	 e 	 	and	cast	it	in	 re 	 s 	 in 	 	,	you	lose	a	little	bit	of	volume	,	you	lose	a	little	bit	of	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	when	i	held	my	 bron 	 ze 	 	one	up	against	my	sculpey	one	,	it	was	 short 	 er 	 	by	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	an	inch	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	no	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	like	aah	--	why	did	n't	i	remember	 th 	 is 	 	?
why	did	n't	i	start	and	make	it	 big 	 ger 	 	?
so	what	do	i	do	?	i	figure	i	have	two	 option 	 s 	 	.
one	,	i	can	fire	a	 freak 	 ing 	 	laser	at	it	,	which	i	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	to	do	a	3d	 s 	 can 	 	--	there	's	a	3d	 s 	 can 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	falcon	.
i	had	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	the	exact	amount	of	 shrink 	 age 	 	i	 achiev 	 ed 	 	going	from	a	wax	master	to	a	 bron 	 ze 	 	master	and	blown	 th 	 is 	 	up	big	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	a	3d	lithography	master	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	i	will	polish	,	then	i	will	 s 	 end 	 	to	the	mold	maker	and	then	i	will	have	it	 d 	 one 	 	in	 bron 	 ze 	 	.	or	:	there	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	people	who	own	 original 	 s 	 	,	and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	contact	them	and	reach	them	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	they	will	let	me	 s 	 pend 	 	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	in	the	presence	of	one	of	the	real	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	to	take	a	picture	,	or	even	to	pull	out	the	hand	-	held	laser	scanner	that	i	happen	to	own	that	 fit 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	a	 ce 	 real 	 	box	,	and	could	 may 	 be 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	even	 touch 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bird	,	i	 s 	 wear 	 	,	get	a	perfect	3d	 s 	 can 	 	.	and	i	'm	even	 will 	 ing 	 	to	sign	 page 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	i	'll	never	let	 any 	 one 	 	else	have	it	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	me	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	,	i	promise	.
i	'll	give	them	one	if	they	want	it	.
and	then	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	then	i	'll	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	,	if	we	're	all	going	to	be	honest	with	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	i	have	to	admit	that	 achiev 	 ing 	 	the	end	of	the	 exercis 	 e 	 	was	never	the	point	of	the	 exercis 	 e 	 	to	begin	with	,	was	it	.
thank	you	.
