if	you	'd	like	to	learn	how	to	play	the	 lob 	 ster 	 	,	we	have	some	here	.
and	that	's	not	a	joke	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	.
so	come	up	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	and	i	'll	show	you	how	to	play	a	 lob 	 ster 	 	.
so	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	mantis	shrimp	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 be 	 cause 	 	they	make	sound	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 record 	 ing 	 	i	made	of	a	mantis	shrimp	that	's	found	off	the	coast	of	california	.
and	while	that	's	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	sound	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	project	.
and	while	i	was	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	figure	out	how	and	why	mantis	shrimp	,	or	 s 	 tomato 	 pods 	 	,	make	sound	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	 the 	 ir 	 	appendages	.
and	mantis	shrimp	are	 call 	 ed 	 	``	mantis	shrimp	``	after	the	 pray 	 ing 	 	 mantis 	 es 	 	,	which	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	fast	 feed 	 ing 	 	 append 	 age 	 	.	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	will	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	while	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	,	to	figure	out	how	these	 animal 	 s 	 	generate	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 feed 	 ing 	 	 strike 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 to 	 day 	 	i	'll	talk	about	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	stomatopod	strike	,	work	that	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	wyatt	korff	and	roy	caldwell	.
so	,	mantis	shrimp	come	in	two	 varie 	 ties 	 	:	there	are	spearers	and	smashers	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 spear 	 ing 	 	mantis	shrimp	,	or	stomatopod	.
and	he	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	sand	,	and	he	 catch 	 es 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	go	by	 over 	 head 	 	.
so	,	a	quick	strike	like	that	.	and	if	we	 s 	 low 	 	it	down	a	bit	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	mantis	shrimp	--	the	same	species	--	 record 	 ed 	 	at	1,000	 frame 	 s 	 	a	second	,	 play 	 ed 	 	back	at	15	 frame 	 s 	 	per	second	.
and	you	can	see	it	's	just	a	 re 	 ally 	 	spectacular	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	the	 limb 	 s 	 	,	 expl 	 o 	 d 	 ing 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	catch	a	dead	piece	of	shrimp	that	i	had	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	it	.
now	,	the	other	type	of	mantis	shrimp	is	the	smasher	stomatopod	,	and	these	 guy 	 s 	 	open	up	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	for	a	living	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 get 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 nail 	 	all	set	up	and	 give 	 s 	 	it	a	good	whack	.
so	,	i	'll	play	it	one	more	time	.
he	 wig 	 gle 	 s 	 	it	in	place	,	 tug 	 s 	 	it	with	his	nose	,	and	 s 	 mash 	 	.
and	a	few	smashes	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	 s 	 nail 	 	is	broken	open	,	and	he	's	got	a	good	 d 	 inner 	 	.
so	,	the	smasher	raptorial	 append 	 age 	 	can	stab	with	a	point	at	the	end	,	or	it	can	 s 	 mash 	 	with	the	heel	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	i	'll	talk	about	the	 s 	 mash 	 ing 	 	type	of	strike	.
and	so	the	first	question	that	came	to	mind	was	,	well	,	how	fast	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	limb	move	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	moving	 pre 	 tty 	 	darn	fast	on	that	video	.
and	i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	came	 up 	 on 	 	a	problem	.
every	single	high	-	speed	video	system	in	the	biology	 depart 	 ment 	 	at	berkeley	was	n't	fast	 en 	 ough 	 	to	catch	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
we	 simpl 	 y 	 	could	n't	capture	it	on	video	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	had	me	 s 	 ty 	 mi 	 ed 	 	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	period	of	time	.
and	then	a	bbc	crew	came	 cruis 	 ing 	 	through	the	biology	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	looking	for	a	story	to	do	about	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	in	biology	.
and	so	we	 s 	 truck 	 	up	a	deal	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	if	you	 guy 	 s 	 	rent	the	high	-	speed	video	system	that	could	capture	these	 move 	 ments 	 	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	can	film	us	 collect 	 ing 	 	the	data	.	``
and	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	they	went	for	it	.
so	we	got	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	video	system	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	new	technology	--	it	just	came	out	about	a	year	ago	--	that	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	film	at	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	high	 speed 	 s 	 	in	low	light	.
and	low	light	is	a	critical	issue	with	 film 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	it	's	too	high	,	you	fry	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	mantis	shrimp	.	there	are	the	 eye 	 s 	 	up	here	,	and	there	's	that	raptorial	 append 	 age 	 	,	and	there	's	the	heel	.
and	that	thing	's	going	to	 s 	 wing 	 	around	and	 s 	 mash 	 	the	 s 	 nail 	 	.
and	the	 s 	 nail 	 	's	wired	to	a	stick	,	so	he	's	a	little	bit	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	set	up	the	shot	.	and	--	 yea 	 h 	 	.
i	hope	there	are	n't	any	 s 	 nail 	 	 right 	 s 	 	 activist 	 s 	 	around	here	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	 film 	 ed 	 	at	5,000	 frame 	 s 	 	per	second	,	and	i	'm	 play 	 ing 	 	it	back	at	15.	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	333	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	'll	notice	,	it	's	still	 pre 	 tty 	 	 go 	 sh 	 	darn	fast	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	333	 time 	 s 	 	.	it	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
the	whole	limb	 extend 	 s 	 	out	.	the	body	flexes	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	--	just	a	spectacular	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	so	what	we	did	is	,	we	took	a	look	at	these	 video 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 measur 	 ed 	 	how	fast	the	limb	was	moving	to	get	back	to	that	original	question	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	for	our	first	surprise	.
so	what	we	 calcul 	 ated 	 	was	that	the	 limb 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	moving	at	the	peak	speed	ranging	from	10	 meter 	 s 	 	per	second	all	the	way	up	to	23	 meter 	 s 	 	per	second	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	prefer	 mile 	 s 	 	per	hour	,	that	's	over	45	 mile 	 s 	 	per	hour	in	water	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	darn	fast	.
in	fact	,	it	's	so	fast	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	add	a	new	point	on	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	animal	 move 	 ment 	 	spectrum	.
and	mantis	shrimp	are	 official 	 ly 	 	the	 fast 	 est 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	 feed 	 ing 	 	strike	of	any	animal	system	.	so	our	first	surprise	.
so	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	you	might	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	well	,	how	do	they	do	it	?
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	work	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	1960s	by	a	famous	biologist	named	malcolm	burrows	.
and	what	he	 show 	 ed 	 	in	mantis	shrimp	is	that	they	use	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	catch	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	``	or	``	click	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.	``
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 consist 	 s 	 	of	is	a	large	muscle	that	 take 	 s 	 	a	good	long	time	to	contract	,	and	a	latch	that	 prevent 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	from	moving	.
so	the	muscle	 contract 	 s 	 	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	once	the	muscle	's	 contract 	 ed 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	's	 store 	 d 	 	up	--	the	latch	flies	 up 	 ward 	 	,	and	you	've	got	the	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	power	 ampl 	 ification 	 	system	.	``
it	 take 	 s 	 	a	long	time	for	the	muscle	to	contract	,	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	time	for	the	limb	to	fly	out	.
and	so	i	thought	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	sort	of	the	end	of	the	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	how	mantis	 shrimp 	 s 	 	make	these	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 strike 	 s 	 	.
but	then	i	took	a	trip	to	the	national	museum	of	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	if	any	of	you	ever	have	a	chance	,	 back 	 stage 	 	of	the	national	museum	of	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	one	of	the	world	's	best	 collect 	 ions 	 	of	 preserve 	 d 	 	mantis	shrimp	.	and	what	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	serious	business	for	me	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	--	what	i	saw	,	on	every	single	mantis	shrimp	limb	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	spearer	or	a	smasher	,	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	saddle	-	shaped	structure	right	on	the	top	surface	of	the	limb	.	and	you	can	see	it	right	here	.
it	just	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	saddle	you	'd	put	on	a	horse	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	structure	.
and	it	's	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	membranous	 area 	 s 	 	.	and	 t 	 hose 	 	membranous	 area 	 s 	 	 suggest 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	some	kind	of	 dynamic 	 ally 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	structure	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	sort	of	had	me	 scratch 	 ing 	 	my	head	for	a	while	.
and	then	we	did	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 calcul 	 ations 	 	,	and	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	show	is	that	these	mantis	shrimp	have	to	have	a	spring	.
there	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	some	kind	of	spring	-	 load 	 ed 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	in	order	to	generate	the	amount	of	force	that	we	 observ 	 e 	 	,	and	the	speed	that	we	 observ 	 e 	 	,	and	the	 out 	 put 	 	of	the	system	.
so	we	thought	,	ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	must	be	a	spring	--	the	saddle	could	 ver 	 y 	 	well	be	a	spring	.
and	we	went	back	to	 t 	 hose 	 	high	-	speed	 video 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 visual 	 ize 	 	the	saddle	 compress 	 ing 	 	and	 extend 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	'll	just	do	that	one	more	time	.
and	then	if	you	take	a	look	at	the	video	--	it	's	a	little	bit	hard	to	see	--	it	's	 out 	 lined 	 	in	yellow	.
the	saddle	is	 out 	 lined 	 	in	yellow	.	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	it	 extend 	 ing 	 	over	the	course	of	the	strike	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	hyperextending	.
so	,	we	've	had	 ver 	 y 	 	solid	evidence	 show 	 ing 	 	that	that	saddle	-	shaped	structure	 actual 	 ly 	 	compresses	and	 extend 	 s 	 	,	and	 do 	 es 	 	,	in	fact	,	function	 a 	 s 	 	a	spring	.
the	saddle	-	shaped	structure	is	 al 	 so 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	``	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	paraboloid	surface	,	``	or	an	``	anticlastic	surface	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	well	known	to	 engineer 	 s 	 	and	 architect 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	surface	in	 compress 	 ion 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 curv 	 es 	 	in	two	 direction 	 s 	 	,	one	 curv 	 e 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	and	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 trans 	 verse 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	down	the	other	,	so	any	kind	of	perturbation	 spread 	 s 	 	the	 force 	 s 	 	over	the	surface	of	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	shape	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	well	known	to	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	well	known	to	 biologist 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	known	to	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	people	who	make	 jewel 	 ry 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 requir 	 es 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	material	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	surface	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	.
so	if	you	're	going	to	build	a	thin	gold	structure	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	to	have	it	in	a	shape	that	's	strong	.
now	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	known	to	 architect 	 s 	 	.	one	of	the	most	famous	 architect 	 s 	 	is	eduardo	catalano	,	who	 popular 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	structure	.
and	what	's	 show 	 n 	 	here	is	a	saddle	-	shaped	roof	that	he	built	that	's	87	and	a	half	feet	spanwise	.
it	's	two	and	a	half	 inch 	 es 	 	thick	,	and	 support 	 ed 	 	at	two	 point 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	he	designed	 roof 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	--	he	found	it	 fasci 	 nating 	 	that	you	could	build	 s 	 uch 	 	a	strong	structure	that	's	made	of	so	few	 material 	 s 	 	and	can	be	 support 	 ed 	 	by	so	few	 point 	 s 	 	.
and	all	of	these	are	the	same	 principle 	 s 	 	that	 app 	 ly 	 	to	the	saddle	-	shaped	spring	in	 s 	 tomato 	 pods 	 	.
in	 bio 	 logical 	 	 system 	 s 	 	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	not	to	have	a	whole	lot	of	extra	material	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	for	building	it	.
so	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 parallel 	 s 	 	between	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	and	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 world 	 s 	 	.	and	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	--	the	stomatopod	saddle	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	the	first	 de 	 scribed 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	paraboloid	spring	.
that	's	a	bit	long	,	but	it	is	sort	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	the	next	and	final	question	was	,	well	,	how	much	force	 do 	 es 	 	a	mantis	shrimp	produce	if	they	're	able	to	break	open	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	?
and	so	i	wired	up	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	load	cell	.
a	load	cell	 measure 	 s 	 	 force 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	piezoelectronic	load	cell	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	little	crystal	in	it	.
and	when	 th 	 is 	 	crystal	is	 squeez 	 ed 	 	,	the	 electric 	 al 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	change	and	it	--	which	--	in	proportion	to	the	 force 	 s 	 	that	go	in	.
so	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 wonder 	 fully 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	,	and	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	all	the	time	.	and	so	all	i	had	to	do	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	a	little	shrimp	paste	on	the	front	of	the	load	cell	,	and	they	'd	 s 	 mash 	 	away	at	it	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	regular	video	of	the	animal	just	 s 	 mash 	 ing 	 	the	heck	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	load	cell	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	get	some	force	 measure 	 ments 	 	out	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	for	a	surprise	.
i	 purchase 	 d 	 	a	100	-	pound	load	cell	,	 think 	 ing 	 	,	no	animal	could	produce	more	than	100	 pound 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	of	an	animal	.
and	what	do	you	know	?	they	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 over 	 load 	 ed 	 	the	load	cell	.
so	these	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	some	old	data	where	i	had	to	find	the	 small 	 est 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	measure	 force 	 s 	 	of	well	over	100	 pound 	 s 	 	generated	by	an	animal	about	 th 	 is 	 	big	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	just	last	week	i	got	a	300	-	pound	load	cell	up	and	running	,	and	i	've	 clock 	 ed 	 	these	 animal 	 s 	 	generating	well	over	200	 pound 	 s 	 	of	force	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	a	world	record	.
i	have	to	do	a	little	bit	more	 back 	 ground 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	the	largest	amount	of	force	 produce 	 d 	 	by	an	animal	of	a	 give 	 n 	 	--	per	body	mass	.	so	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 force 	 s 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	back	to	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	that	spring	in	storing	up	and	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	so	much	energy	in	 th 	 is 	 	system	.
but	that	was	not	the	end	of	the	story	.
now	,	 thing 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	making	 th 	 is 	 	sound	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	work	.
and	i	got	all	these	force	 measure 	 ments 	 	,	and	then	i	went	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	force	 out 	 put 	 	of	the	system	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	--	time	is	on	the	x	-	axis	and	the	force	is	on	the	y	-	axis	.	and	you	can	see	two	 peak 	 s 	 	.
and	that	was	what	 re 	 ally 	 	got	me	 puzzl 	 ed 	 	.
the	first	peak	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	is	the	limb	hitting	the	load	cell	.
but	there	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	large	second	peak	half	a	 milli 	 second 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	i	did	n't	know	what	that	was	.
so	now	,	you	'd	expect	a	second	peak	for	other	 reason 	 s 	 	,	but	not	half	a	 milli 	 second 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	going	back	to	 t 	 hose 	 	high	-	speed	 video 	 s 	 	,	there	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	hint	of	what	might	be	going	on	.
here	's	that	same	 orient 	 ation 	 	that	we	saw	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
there	's	that	raptorial	 append 	 age 	 	--	there	's	the	heel	,	and	it	's	going	to	 s 	 wing 	 	around	and	hit	the	load	cell	.
and	what	i	'd	like	you	to	do	in	 th 	 is 	 	shot	is	keep	your	eye	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	on	the	surface	of	the	load	cell	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	limb	 come 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	through	.
and	i	hope	what	you	are	able	to	see	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	flash	of	light	.
audience	:	 w 	 ow 	 	.
sheila	patek	:	and	so	if	we	just	take	that	one	frame	,	what	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	there	at	the	end	of	that	yellow	arrow	is	a	vapor	bubble	.
and	what	that	is	,	is	cavitation	.
and	cavitation	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	potent	fluid	dynamic	 phenomen 	 on 	 	which	 occur 	 s 	 	when	you	have	 area 	 s 	 	of	water	moving	at	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	different	 speed 	 s 	 	.
and	when	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	it	can	cause	 area 	 s 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	low	pressure	,	which	 result 	 s 	 	in	the	water	 liter 	 ally 	 	vaporizing	.
and	when	that	vapor	bubble	 collapse 	 s 	 	,	it	 emit 	 s 	 	sound	,	light	and	heat	,	and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 destruct 	 ive 	 	process	.
and	so	here	it	is	in	the	stomatopod	.	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	 engineer 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 destroy 	 s 	 	boat	propellers	.
people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	to	try	and	design	a	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 rot 	 ating 	 	boat	 propel 	 ler 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cavitate	and	 liter 	 ally 	 	wear	away	the	metal	and	put	 hole 	 s 	 	in	it	,	just	like	these	 picture 	 s 	 	show	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	potent	force	in	fluid	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	just	to	sort	of	take	it	one	step	further	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	mantis	shrimp	 approach 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 nail 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	taken	at	20,000	 frame 	 s 	 	per	second	,	and	i	have	to	give	full	credit	to	the	bbc	 camera 	 man 	 	,	tim	green	,	for	setting	 th 	 is 	 	shot	up	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	could	never	have	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	--	one	of	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	with	professional	 camera 	 men 	 	.
you	can	see	it	coming	in	,	and	an	 in 	 credible 	 	flash	of	light	,	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	cavitation	 spread 	 ing 	 	over	the	surface	of	the	 s 	 nail 	 	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	just	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	image	,	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	,	to	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 s 	 low 	 	 speed 	 s 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	can	see	it	in	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	form	there	,	with	the	bubble	 form 	 ing 	 	and	 col 	 lap 	 s 	 ing 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 surface 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	you	might	have	even	 s 	 een 	 	some	cavitation	going	up	the	edge	of	the	limb	.
so	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	quandary	of	the	two	force	 peak 	 s 	 	:	what	i	think	was	going	on	is	:	that	first	impact	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	limb	hitting	the	load	cell	,	and	the	second	impact	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	collapse	of	the	cavitation	bubble	.
and	these	 animal 	 s 	 	may	 ver 	 y 	 	well	be	making	use	of	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	force	and	the	energy	 store 	 d 	 	with	that	 special 	 ized 	 	spring	,	but	the	 extrem 	 es 	 	of	the	fluid	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.	and	they	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	making	use	of	fluid	 dynamic 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	second	force	for	 break 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 nail 	 	.
so	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	double	 wham 	 my 	 	,	so	to	speak	,	from	these	 animal 	 s 	 	.
so	,	one	question	i	often	get	after	 th 	 is 	 	talk	--	so	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	i	'd	answer	it	now	--	is	,	well	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	animal	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	if	it	's	 break 	 ing 	 	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	,	the	poor	limb	must	be	 dis 	 integ 	 rating 	 	.	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
that	's	the	 s 	 mash 	 ing 	 	part	of	the	heel	on	both	these	 image 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	worn	away	.	in	fact	,	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	them	wear	away	 the 	 ir 	 	heel	all	the	way	to	the	 fl 	 esh 	 	.
but	one	of	the	convenient	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	an	arthropod	is	that	you	have	to	molt	.	and	every	three	 month 	 s 	 	or	so	these	 animal 	 s 	 	molt	,	and	they	build	a	new	limb	and	it	's	no	problem	.
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	convenient	solution	to	that	 part 	 icular 	 	problem	.
so	,	i	'd	like	to	end	on	sort	of	a	 wack 	 y 	 	note	.
 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 wack 	 y 	 	to	 folk 	 s 	 	like	you	,	i	do	n't	know	.
so	,	the	saddles	--	that	saddle	-	shaped	spring	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	well	known	to	 biologist 	 s 	 	for	a	long	time	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	spring	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	visual	signal	.
and	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	spectacular	 color 	 ed 	 	dot	in	the	center	of	the	saddles	of	 man 	 y 	 	species	of	 s 	 tomato 	 pods 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	to	find	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 origin 	 s 	 	of	visual	 signal 	 s 	 	on	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	in	all	species	,	 the 	 ir 	 	spring	.
and	i	think	one	 explan 	 ation 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	going	back	to	the	molting	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
so	these	 animal 	 s 	 	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	molting	period	where	they	're	 un 	 able 	 	to	strike	--	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	soft	.
and	they	're	 liter 	 ally 	 	 un 	 able 	 	to	strike	or	they	will	self	-	destruct	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	for	real	.	and	what	they	do	is	,	up	 un 	 til 	 	that	time	period	when	they	ca	n't	strike	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 ob 	 nox 	 ious 	 	and	awful	,	and	they	strike	 every 	 thing 	 	in	sight	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	who	or	what	.
and	the	second	they	get	 in 	 to 	 	that	time	point	when	they	ca	n't	strike	any	more	,	they	just	signal	.	they	wave	 the 	 ir 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	around	.
and	it	's	one	of	the	classic	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	in	animal	behavior	of	 bluff 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	a	well	-	 establish 	 ed 	 	fact	of	these	 animal 	 s 	 	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	bluff	.	they	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	strike	,	but	they	pretend	to	.
and	so	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	 dot 	 s 	 	in	the	center	of	the	saddles	are	 convey 	 ing 	 	some	kind	of	information	about	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	strike	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	strike	force	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	time	period	in	the	molting	cycle	.
so	sort	of	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	strange	fact	to	find	a	visual	structure	right	in	the	middle	of	 the 	 ir 	 	spring	.
so	to	conclude	,	i	 most 	 ly 	 	want	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	my	two	 collabor 	 ators 	 	,	wyatt	korff	and	roy	caldwell	,	who	 work 	 ed 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	with	me	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
