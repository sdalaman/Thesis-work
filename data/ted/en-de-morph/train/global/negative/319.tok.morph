the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	the	web	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	,	the	kind	of	web	--	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	all	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	is	 al 	 ready 	 	less	than	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	old	.
so	all	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	come	about	,	 start 	 ing 	 	,	say	,	with	satellite	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	whole	earth	,	which	we	could	n't	even	imagine	 happen 	 ing 	 	before	,	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	just	 th 	 is 	 	abundance	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	right	before	us	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	our	 lap 	 top 	 	,	or	our	 desk 	 top 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 corn 	 ucopia 	 	of	stuff	just	coming	and	never	 end 	 ing 	 	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	're	not	 amaz 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	that	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	here	.
it	's	in	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 ha 	 s 	 	come	.
and	i	know	that	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	if	i	had	told	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	all	coming	,	you	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	that	that	's	 im 	 possible 	 	.
there	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	no	economic	model	that	that	would	be	possible	.
and	if	i	told	you	it	was	all	coming	for	free	,	you	would	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	--	you	're	 dream 	 ing 	 	.
you	're	a	californian	 utopia 	 n 	 	.	you	're	a	wild	-	eyed	optimist	.
and	yet	it	's	here	.
the	other	thing	that	we	know	about	it	was	that	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	even	wired	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	we	thought	it	was	going	to	be	tv	,	but	better	.
that	was	the	model	.	that	was	what	 every 	 body 	 	was	 suggest 	 ing 	 	was	going	to	be	coming	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	that	's	not	what	it	was	.
first	of	all	,	it	was	 im 	 possible 	 	,	and	it	's	not	what	it	was	.
and	so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	think	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	--	if	you	think	about	,	like	,	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	in	 theor 	 y 	 	,	but	possible	in	practice	.
and	if	you	take	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 im 	 possible 	 	,	i	think	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	era	,	from	 th 	 is 	 	last	decade	,	is	that	we	have	to	get	good	at	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	the	 im 	 possible 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 un 	 prepared 	 	for	it	.
so	,	i	'm	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	what	's	going	to	happen	in	the	next	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	.
but	if	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	,	what	's	going	to	happen	in	the	next	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	?
so	,	i	have	a	kind	of	a	simple	story	,	and	it	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	what	we	want	to	think	about	is	 th 	 is 	 	thing	that	we	're	making	,	 th 	 is 	 	thing	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	--	that	's	all	these	 computer 	 s 	 	,	all	these	 hand 	 held 	 s 	 	,	all	these	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	,	all	these	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	,	all	these	 serv 	 ers 	 	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	all	these	 connect 	 ions 	 	is	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	one	machine	.
if	there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	machine	,	and	our	little	 hand 	 held 	 s 	 	and	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	little	 window 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	but	that	we	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 construct 	 ing 	 	a	single	,	global	machine	.
and	so	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	that	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	machine	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	the	most	 reli 	 able 	 	machine	that	we	've	ever	made	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 crash 	 ed 	 	;	it	's	running	 un 	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	.
and	there	's	 al 	 most 	 	no	other	machine	that	we	've	ever	made	that	 run 	 s 	 	the	number	of	 hour 	 s 	 	,	the	number	of	 day 	 s 	 	.
5,000	 day 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 interrupt 	 ion 	 	--	that	's	just	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
and	of	course	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 long 	 er 	 	than	just	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	;	the	web	is	 on 	 ly 	 	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	make	 measure 	 ments 	 	.
what	are	the	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	machine	?
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	off	by	 calcul 	 ating 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 click 	 s 	 	there	are	all	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	on	all	the	 computer 	 s 	 	.
and	there	is	a	100	billion	 click 	 s 	 	per	day	.
and	there	's	55	trillion	 link 	 s 	 	between	all	the	web	 page 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
and	so	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	more	about	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	and	i	made	a	quick	list	.	was	it	chris	jordan	,	the	 photograph 	 er 	 	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 number 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	so	large	that	they	're	 meaning 	 less 	 	?
well	,	here	's	a	list	of	them	.	they	're	hard	to	tell	,	but	there	's	one	billion	pc	 chip 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	if	you	count	all	the	 chip 	 s 	 	in	all	the	 computer 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
there	's	two	million	 email 	 s 	 	per	second	.
so	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	number	.
it	's	just	a	huge	machine	,	and	it	uses	five	percent	of	the	global	 electric 	 ity 	 	on	the	planet	.
so	here	's	the	 specific 	 ations 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	make	up	a	spec	sheet	for	it	:	170	 quad 	 r 	 ill 	 ion 	 	 transistor 	 s 	 	,	55	trillion	 link 	 s 	 	,	 email 	 s 	 	running	at	two	 mega 	 hertz 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	31	 kilo 	 hertz 	 	text	 mess 	 aging 	 	,	246	 exa 	 byte 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	.	that	's	a	big	 dis 	 k 	 	.
that	's	a	lot	of	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	,	 memor 	 y 	 	.	nine	 exa 	 byte 	 	ram	.
and	the	total	traffic	on	 th 	 is 	 	is	running	at	seven	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	per	second	.
brewster	was	 say 	 ing 	 	the	library	of	congress	is	about	twenty	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	.
so	every	second	,	half	of	the	library	of	congress	is	 s 	 woosh 	 ing 	 	around	in	 th 	 is 	 	machine	.	it	's	a	big	machine	.
so	i	did	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	100	billion	 click 	 s 	 	per	day	,	55	trillion	 link 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	number	of	 synapse 	 s 	 	in	your	brain	.
a	 quad 	 r 	 ill 	 ion 	 	 transistor 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	number	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	your	brain	.
so	to	a	first	 ap 	 proxim 	 ation 	 	,	we	have	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	twenty	 pet 	 a 	 hertz 	 	synapse	 fir 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	the	 memor 	 y 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	huge	.
but	to	a	first	 ap 	 proxim 	 ation 	 	,	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	machine	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	--	and	 it 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	kind	of	--	to	your	brain	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	fact	,	that	's	how	your	brain	 work 	 s 	 	--	in	kind	of	the	same	way	that	the	web	 work 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	your	brain	is	n't	 doub 	 ling 	 	every	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	if	we	say	 th 	 is 	 	machine	right	now	that	we	've	made	is	about	one	hb	,	one	human	brain	,	if	we	look	at	the	rate	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	increasing	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	there	'll	be	six	billion	hbs	.
so	by	the	year	2040	,	the	total	 process 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	machine	will	exceed	a	total	 process 	 ing 	 	power	of	 human 	 ity 	 	,	in	raw	bits	and	stuff	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	i	think	,	where	ray	kurzweil	and	 other 	 s 	 	get	 th 	 is 	 	little	chart	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	're	going	to	cross	.
so	,	what	about	that	?	well	,	here	's	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	have	three	kind	of	general	 thing 	 s 	 	i	would	like	to	say	,	three	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
first	,	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	 th 	 is 	 	machine	is	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 em 	 body 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	giving	it	a	body	.	and	that	's	what	we	're	going	to	do	in	the	next	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	--	we	're	going	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	machine	a	body	.
and	the	second	thing	is	,	we	're	going	to	 re 	 structure 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 co 	 dependent 	 	 up 	 on 	 	it	.
so	let	me	go	through	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	we	have	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	in	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
we	think	they	're	all	 separat 	 e 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	but	in	fact	,	every	screen	in	the	world	is	looking	 in 	 to 	 	the	one	machine	.
these	are	all	 bas 	 ically 	 	 port 	 al 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	one	machine	.
the	second	thing	is	that	--	some	people	call	 th 	 is 	 	the	cloud	,	and	you	're	kind	of	 touch 	 ing 	 	the	cloud	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	in	some	ways	,	all	you	 re 	 ally 	 	need	is	a	 cloud 	 book 	 	.
and	the	 cloud 	 book 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	.
it	's	 wire 	 less 	 	.	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
there	's	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	it	.	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	you	're	just	 touch 	 ing 	 	the	machine	,	you	're	 touch 	 ing 	 	the	cloud	and	you	're	going	to	compute	that	way	.
so	the	machine	is	computing	.
and	in	some	ways	,	it	's	sort	of	back	to	the	kind	of	old	idea	of	 central 	 ized 	 	computing	.
but	 every 	 thing 	 	,	all	the	 camera 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 micro 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 sensor 	 s 	 	in	 car 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	machine	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	will	go	through	the	web	.
and	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	that	 al 	 ready 	 	with	,	say	,	 phone 	 s 	 	.
right	now	,	 phone 	 s 	 	do	n't	go	through	the	web	,	but	they	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	,	and	they	will	.
and	if	you	imagine	what	,	say	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	what	google	 lab 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	google	 doc 	 s 	 	,	google	 spread 	 sheet 	 s 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	--	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	web	based	.
they	're	going	through	the	machine	.
and	i	am	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	every	bit	will	be	owned	by	the	web	.
right	now	,	it	's	not	.	if	you	do	 spread 	 sheet 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	at	work	,	a	word	document	,	they	are	n't	on	the	web	,	but	they	are	going	to	be	.	they	're	going	to	be	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	machine	.
they	're	going	to	speak	the	web	language	.
they	're	going	to	talk	to	the	machine	.
the	web	,	in	some	sense	,	is	kind	of	like	a	black	hole	that	's	 suck 	 ing 	 	up	 every 	 thing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	so	every	thing	will	be	part	of	the	web	.
so	every	item	,	every	artifact	that	we	make	,	will	have	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	it	some	little	 s 	 liver 	 	of	web	-	ness	and	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	and	it	will	be	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	machine	,	so	that	our	environment	--	kind	of	in	that	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	computing	sense	--	our	environment	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	web	.	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	with	rfids	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 what 	 ever 	 	technology	it	is	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.	the	point	is	that	 every 	 thing 	 	will	have	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	it	some	sensor	 connect 	 ing 	 	it	to	the	machine	,	and	so	we	have	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	an	 inter 	 net 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	you	begin	to	think	of	a	shoe	 a 	 s 	 	a	chip	with	 heel 	 s 	 	,	and	a	car	 a 	 s 	 	a	chip	with	 wheel 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	most	of	the	cost	of	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	is	the	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	and	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	in	it	,	and	not	the	 material 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	people	think	about	the	new	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	going	to	be	a	 dis 	 embodi 	 ed 	 	,	 alter 	 native 	 	,	virtual	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	and	that	we	would	have	the	old	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	 atom 	 s 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	what	the	new	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	is	the	marriage	of	 t 	 hose 	 	two	,	where	we	embed	the	information	,	and	the	digital	nature	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	material	world	.
that	's	what	we	're	looking	forward	to	.	that	is	where	we	're	going	--	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 ion 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 converg 	 ence 	 	of	the	atomic	and	the	digital	.
and	so	one	of	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	that	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	is	that	where	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	spectrum	of	media	right	now	--	tv	,	film	,	video	--	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	one	media	platform	.
and	while	there	's	 man 	 y 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	some	 sense 	 s 	 	,	they	will	share	more	and	more	in	common	with	each	other	.
so	that	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	media	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	fact	that	copies	have	no	value	,	the	value	's	in	the	 un 	 cop 	 i 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	 immedi 	 acy 	 	,	the	 authentic 	 ation 	 	,	the	 personal 	 ization 	 	.
the	media	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	liquid	.
the	reason	why	 thing 	 s 	 	are	free	is	so	that	you	can	 manipul 	 ate 	 	them	,	not	so	that	they	are	``	free	``	 a 	 s 	 	in	``	beer	,	``	but	``	free	``	 a 	 s 	 	in	``	 free 	 dom 	 	.	``
and	the	network	 effect 	 s 	 	rule	,	meaning	that	the	more	you	have	,	the	more	you	get	.
the	first	fax	machine	--	the	person	who	 b 	 ought 	 	the	first	fax	machine	was	an	idiot	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	 no 	 body 	 	to	fax	to	.
but	here	she	 be 	 came 	 	an	 evangel 	 ist 	 	,	 recruit 	 ing 	 	 other 	 s 	 	to	get	the	fax	 machine 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	made	 the 	 ir 	 	purchase	more	 valu 	 able 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 effect 	 s 	 	that	we	're	going	to	see	.
attention	is	the	 curr 	 ency 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	 law 	 s 	 	are	going	to	kind	of	spread	 through 	 out 	 	all	media	.
and	the	other	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	 embodi 	 ment 	 	is	that	there	's	kind	of	what	i	call	the	mcluhan	 revers 	 al 	 	.
mcluhan	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 machine 	 s 	 	are	the	 extens 	 ions 	 	of	the	human	 sense 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 human 	 s 	 	are	now	going	to	be	the	 extend 	 ed 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	of	the	machine	,	``	in	a	certain	sense	.
so	we	have	a	trillion	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	 ear 	 s 	 	,	and	 touch 	 es 	 	,	through	all	our	digital	 photograph 	 s 	 	and	 camera 	 s 	 	.
and	we	see	that	in	 thing 	 s 	 	like	flickr	,	or	photosynth	,	 th 	 is 	 	program	from	 micro 	 soft 	 	that	will	allow	you	to	assemble	a	view	of	a	 tourist 	 y 	 	place	from	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	tourist	 snap 	 shot 	 s 	 	of	it	.
in	a	certain	sense	,	the	machine	is	 see 	 ing 	 	through	the	 pixel 	 s 	 	of	individual	 camera 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	second	thing	that	i	want	to	talk	about	was	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 rest 	 ructur 	 ing 	 	,	that	what	the	web	is	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 rest 	 ructur 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	have	to	 war 	 n 	 	you	,	that	what	we	'll	talk	about	is	--	i	'm	going	to	give	my	 explan 	 ation 	 	of	a	term	you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	a	``	semantic	web	.	``
so	first	of	all	,	the	first	stage	that	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	was	that	it	was	going	to	link	 computer 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	 call 	 ed 	 	the	net	;	that	was	the	 inter 	 net 	 	of	 net 	 s 	 	.
and	we	saw	that	,	where	you	have	all	the	 computer 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
and	if	you	remember	,	it	was	a	kind	of	green	screen	with	 cursor 	 s 	 	,	and	there	was	 re 	 ally 	 	not	much	to	do	,	and	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	connect	it	,	you	 connect 	 ed 	 	it	from	one	computer	to	 an 	 other 	 	computer	.
and	what	you	had	to	do	was	--	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	had	to	share	 pack 	 et 	 s 	 	of	information	.
so	you	 we 	 re 	 	 forward 	 ing 	 	on	.	you	did	n't	have	control	.
it	was	n't	like	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	system	where	you	had	control	of	a	line	:	you	had	to	share	 pack 	 et 	 s 	 	.
the	second	stage	that	we	're	in	now	is	the	idea	of	 link 	 ing 	 	 page 	 s 	 	.
so	in	the	old	one	,	if	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	on	to	an	 air 	 line 	 	web	page	,	i	went	from	my	computer	,	to	an	ftp	 s 	 ite 	 	,	to	 an 	 other 	 	 air 	 line 	 	computer	.
now	we	have	 page 	 s 	 	--	the	unit	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	resolved	 in 	 to 	 	 page 	 s 	 	,	so	one	page	 link 	 s 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	page	.
and	if	i	want	to	go	in	to	book	a	flight	,	i	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 air 	 line 	 	's	flight	page	,	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	of	the	 air 	 line 	 	,	and	i	'm	 link 	 ing 	 	to	that	page	.
and	what	we	're	sharing	 we 	 re 	 	 link 	 s 	 	,	so	you	had	to	be	kind	of	open	with	 link 	 s 	 	.
you	could	n't	 den 	 y 	 	--	if	 some 	 one 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	link	to	you	,	you	could	n't	stop	them	.	you	had	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 open 	 ing 	 	up	your	 page 	 s 	 	to	be	linked	by	 any 	 body 	 	.
so	that	's	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	now	 enter 	 ing 	 	to	the	third	stage	,	which	is	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	and	that	is	where	we	link	the	data	.
so	,	i	do	n't	know	what	the	name	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	.
i	'm	 call 	 ing 	 	it	the	one	machine	.	but	we	're	 link 	 ing 	 	data	.
so	we	're	going	from	machine	to	machine	,	from	page	to	page	,	and	now	data	to	data	.
so	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	,	is	that	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 link 	 ing 	 	from	page	to	page	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	link	from	one	idea	on	a	page	to	 an 	 other 	 	idea	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	to	the	other	page	.
so	every	idea	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	--	or	every	item	,	or	every	 no 	 un 	 	--	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	by	the	entire	web	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	resolved	at	the	level	of	 item 	 s 	 	,	or	 idea 	 s 	 	,	or	 word 	 s 	 	,	if	you	want	.
so	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	 physical 	 ly 	 	coming	out	 aga 	 in 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	it	's	not	just	virtual	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	out	to	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	 some 	 thing 	 	will	 re 	 solve 	 	down	to	the	information	about	a	 part 	 icular 	 	person	,	so	every	person	will	have	a	 un 	 ique 	 	id	.
every	person	,	every	item	will	have	a	 some 	 thing 	 	that	will	be	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	,	and	will	link	to	a	specific	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	that	idea	or	item	.
so	now	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	one	,	when	i	link	to	it	,	i	would	link	to	my	 part 	 icular 	 	flight	,	my	 part 	 icular 	 	seat	.
and	so	,	giving	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	i	live	in	pacifica	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	--	right	now	pacifica	is	just	sort	of	a	name	on	the	web	 some 	 where 	 	.
the	web	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	that	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	town	,	and	that	it	's	a	specific	town	that	i	live	in	,	but	that	's	what	we	're	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
it	's	going	to	link	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	--	it	will	know	,	the	web	will	be	able	to	read	 it 	 self 	 	and	know	that	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	a	place	,	and	that	 when 	 ever 	 	it	 s 	 ees 	 	that	word	,	``	pacifica	,	``	it	 know 	 s 	 	that	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	place	,	latitude	,	 long 	 itude 	 	,	a	certain	population	.
so	here	are	some	of	the	technical	 term 	 s 	 	,	all	three	-	letter	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	you	'll	see	a	lot	more	of	.
all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	about	 enabl 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 link 	 ing 	 	to	the	data	.
so	i	'll	give	you	one	kind	of	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
there	's	like	a	billion	social	 s 	 ites 	 	on	the	web	.
each	time	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	there	,	you	have	to	tell	it	 aga 	 in 	 	who	you	are	and	all	your	 friend 	 s 	 	are	.
why	should	you	be	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?	you	should	just	do	that	once	,	and	it	should	know	who	all	your	 friend 	 s 	 	are	.
so	that	's	what	you	want	,	is	all	your	 friend 	 s 	 	are	identified	,	and	you	should	just	carry	these	 relationship 	 s 	 	around	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	data	about	you	should	just	be	 convey 	 ed 	 	,	and	you	should	do	it	once	and	that	's	all	that	should	happen	.
and	you	should	have	all	the	 network 	 s 	 	of	all	the	 relationship 	 s 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	data	.
that	's	what	we	're	moving	 in 	 to 	 	--	where	it	sort	of	 know 	 s 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	down	to	that	level	.
a	semantic	web	,	web	3.0	,	giant	global	graph	--	we	're	kind	of	 try 	 ing 	 	out	what	we	want	to	call	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
but	what	's	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	is	sharing	data	.
so	you	have	to	be	open	to	 hav 	 ing 	 	your	data	 share 	 d 	 	,	which	is	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	step	than	just	sharing	your	web	page	,	or	your	computer	.
and	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	be	on	 th 	 is 	 	are	not	just	 page 	 s 	 	,	they	are	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	we	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	every	artifact	or	place	,	will	be	a	specific	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	will	have	a	specific	character	that	can	be	linked	to	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
so	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 data 	 base 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	fourth	thing	that	we	have	not	get	to	,	that	we	wo	n't	see	in	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	or	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	,	but	i	think	that	's	where	we	're	going	to	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	where	i	'm	 link 	 ing 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	 part 	 icular 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	of	my	seat	on	the	plane	--	that	that	physical	thing	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	part	of	the	web	.
and	so	we	are	in	the	middle	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	that	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	linked	,	down	to	every	object	in	the	little	 s 	 liver 	 	of	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	last	thing	i	want	to	talk	about	is	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	we	're	going	to	be	 co 	 dependent 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	be	there	,	and	the	 close 	 r 	 	it	is	,	the	better	.
if	you	allow	google	to	,	it	will	tell	you	your	search	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	i	found	out	by	looking	at	it	that	i	search	most	at	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	am	open	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	to	that	.
and	i	think	total	 personal 	 ization 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	world	will	 requir 	 e 	 	total	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	.
that	is	going	to	be	the	price	.
if	you	want	to	have	total	 personal 	 ization 	 	,	you	have	to	be	 total 	 ly 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	.
google	.	i	ca	n't	remember	my	phone	number	,	i	'll	just	ask	google	.
we	're	so	dependent	on	 th 	 is 	 	that	i	have	now	gotten	to	the	point	where	i	do	n't	even	try	to	remember	 thing 	 s 	 	--	i	'll	just	google	it	.	it	's	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	do	that	.
and	we	kind	of	object	at	first	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	,	that	's	awful	.	``
but	if	we	think	about	the	 depend 	 ency 	 	that	we	have	on	 th 	 is 	 	other	technology	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 alpha 	 bet 	 	,	and	writing	,	we	're	 total 	 ly 	 	dependent	on	it	,	and	it	's	 transform 	 ed 	 	culture	.
we	can	not	imagine	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 alpha 	 bet 	 	and	writing	.
and	so	in	the	same	way	,	we	're	going	to	not	imagine	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	other	machine	 be 	 ing 	 	there	.
and	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	some	kind	of	ai	,	but	it	's	not	the	ai	in	conscious	ai	,	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	an	expert	,	larry	page	told	me	that	that	's	what	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	and	that	's	what	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
but	when	six	billion	 human 	 s 	 	are	googling	,	who	's	 search 	 ing 	 	who	?	it	 go 	 es 	 	both	ways	.
so	we	are	the	web	,	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	.
we	are	going	to	be	the	machine	.
so	the	next	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	going	to	be	the	web	and	 on 	 ly 	 	better	.
just	like	it	was	n't	tv	and	 on 	 ly 	 	better	.
the	next	5,000	 day 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	just	going	to	be	the	web	but	 on 	 ly 	 	better	--	it	's	going	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
and	i	think	it	's	going	to	be	 smart 	 er 	 	.
it	'll	have	an	 intellig 	 ence 	 	in	there	,	that	's	not	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	conscious	.
but	it	'll	 anticip 	 ate 	 	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	in	a	good	sense	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	much	more	 personal 	 ized 	 	.
it	will	know	us	,	and	that	's	good	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	price	of	that	will	be	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 fill 	 ing 	 	your	entire	environment	,	and	we	will	be	in	the	middle	of	it	.
and	all	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	will	be	 port 	 al 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
so	the	single	idea	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	with	you	is	that	we	have	to	begin	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	not	just	``	the	web	,	 on 	 ly 	 	better	,	``	but	a	new	kind	of	stage	in	 th 	 is 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	more	global	.	if	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	,	it	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	machine	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 reli 	 able 	 	machine	,	more	 reli 	 able 	 	than	 it 	 s 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
but	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	think	about	it	 a 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	large	organism	.
so	we	might	respond	to	it	more	 a 	 s 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	whole	system	,	more	 a 	 s 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	a	large	organism	that	we	are	going	to	be	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	.	it	's	a	``	one	.	``
and	i	do	n't	know	what	else	to	call	it	,	than	the	one	.
we	'll	have	a	better	word	for	it	.
but	there	's	a	 un 	 ity 	 	of	some	sort	that	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	emerge	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	do	n't	want	to	talk	about	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	i	want	to	talk	about	it	just	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	was	a	little	bacteria	,	or	a	 vol 	 vox 	 	,	which	is	what	that	organism	is	.
so	,	to	do	,	action	,	take	-	away	.	so	,	here	's	what	i	would	say	:	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	machine	,	and	the	web	is	 it 	 s 	 	os	.
all	 screen 	 s 	 	look	 in 	 to 	 	the	one	.	no	bits	will	live	 out 	 side 	 	the	web	.
to	share	is	to	gain	.	let	the	one	read	it	.
it	's	going	to	be	machine	-	 read 	 able 	 	.
you	want	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	that	the	machine	can	read	.
and	the	one	is	us	.	we	are	in	the	one	.
i	appreciate	your	time	.
