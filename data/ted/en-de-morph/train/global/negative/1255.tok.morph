thank	you	.
it	's	a	real	pleasure	to	be	here	.
i	last	did	a	tedtalk	i	think	about	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	or	so	.
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	spaghetti	sauce	.
and	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	i	guess	,	watch	 t 	 hose 	 	 video 	 s 	 	.
people	have	 be 	 en 	 	coming	up	to	me	ever	since	to	ask	me	 question 	 s 	 	about	spaghetti	sauce	,	which	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	in	the	short	term	--	but	it	's	proven	to	be	less	than	ideal	over	seven	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	 th 	 ough 	 	i	would	come	and	try	and	put	spaghetti	sauce	 be 	 hind 	 	me	.
the	theme	of	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	's	session	is	 thing 	 s 	 	we	make	.
and	so	i	thought	i	would	tell	a	story	about	 some 	 one 	 	who	made	one	of	the	most	precious	 object 	 s 	 	of	his	era	.
and	the	man	's	name	is	carl	norden	.
carl	norden	was	born	in	1880	.
and	he	was	swiss	.
and	of	course	,	the	swiss	can	be	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	two	general	 categor 	 ies 	 	:	 t 	 hose 	 	who	make	small	,	exquisite	,	expensive	 object 	 s 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	handle	the	money	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	buy	small	,	exquisite	,	expensive	 object 	 s 	 	.
and	carl	norden	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 firm 	 ly 	 	in	the	 form 	 er 	 	camp	.
he	's	an	engineer	.
he	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	federal	polytech	in	zurich	.
in	fact	,	one	of	his	 class 	 mate 	 s 	 	is	a	young	man	named	lenin	who	would	go	on	to	break	small	,	expensive	,	exquisite	 object 	 s 	 	.
and	he	's	a	swiss	engineer	,	carl	.
and	i	mean	that	in	 it 	 s 	 	 full 	 est 	 	sense	of	the	word	.
he	 wear 	 s 	 	three	-	piece	 suit 	 s 	 	;	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	 import 	 ant 	 	 must 	 ache 	 	;	and	he	is	 domin 	 eer 	 ing 	 	and	 narcissist 	 ic 	 	and	driven	and	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	ego	;	and	he	 work 	 s 	 	16	-	hour	 day 	 s 	 	;	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	about	 alter 	 nating 	 	current	;	and	he	 feel 	 s 	 	like	a	 s 	 un 	 tan 	 	is	a	sign	of	moral	 weak 	 ness 	 	;	and	he	 drink 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	coffee	;	and	he	 do 	 es 	 	his	best	work	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	his	mother	's	kitchen	in	zurich	for	 hour 	 s 	 	in	complete	silence	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	a	slide	rule	.
in	any	case	,	carl	norden	 e 	 migr 	 ates 	 	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	just	before	the	first	world	war	and	 set 	 s 	 	up	shop	on	lafayette	street	in	 down 	 town 	 	manhattan	.
and	he	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	the	question	of	how	to	drop	 bomb 	 s 	 	from	an	 air 	 plane 	 	.
now	if	you	think	about	it	,	in	the	age	before	gps	and	radar	,	that	was	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	problem	.
it	's	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	physics	problem	.
you	've	got	a	plane	that	's	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	feet	up	in	the	air	,	going	at	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	and	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	drop	an	object	,	a	bomb	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	some	 station 	 ary 	 	target	in	the	face	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 wind 	 s 	 	and	cloud	cover	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	other	 impediment 	 s 	 	.
and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	people	,	moving	up	to	the	first	world	war	and	between	the	 war 	 s 	 	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	and	 near 	 ly 	 	 every 	 body 	 	came	up	short	.
the	 bomb 	 sight 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	.
but	carl	norden	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	one	who	 crack 	 s 	 	the	code	.
and	he	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
it	 weigh 	 s 	 	about	50	 lb 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	norden	mark	15	 bomb 	 sight 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 lever 	 s 	 	and	ball	-	 bear 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 gadget 	 s 	 	and	 gauge 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	.
and	what	he	 allow 	 s 	 	people	to	do	is	he	 make 	 s 	 	the	 bombard 	 ier 	 	take	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	object	,	 visual 	 ly 	 	sight	the	target	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	in	the	plexiglas	 con 	 e 	 	of	the	 bomb 	 er 	 	,	and	then	they	plug	in	the	altitude	of	the	plane	,	the	speed	of	the	plane	,	the	speed	of	the	wind	and	the	 coordinate 	 s 	 	of	the	target	.
and	the	 bomb 	 sight 	 	will	tell	him	when	to	drop	the	bomb	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	norden	 famous 	 ly 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	before	that	 bomb 	 sight 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	 bomb 	 s 	 	would	 routine 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	target	by	a	mile	or	more	.	``
but	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	with	the	mark	15	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	,	he	could	drop	a	bomb	 in 	 to 	 	a	 pick 	 le 	 	barrel	at	20,000	ft	.
now	i	can	not	tell	you	how	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	the	u.s.	 militar 	 y 	 	was	by	the	news	of	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	.
it	was	like	 man 	 na 	 	from	heaven	.
here	was	an	 arm 	 y 	 	that	had	just	had	experience	in	the	first	world	war	,	where	 million 	 s 	 	of	men	 f 	 ought 	 	each	other	in	the	 trench 	 es 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 no 	 where 	 	,	making	no	progress	,	and	here	 some 	 one 	 	had	come	up	with	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	them	to	fly	up	in	the	 ski 	 es 	 	high	above	 ene 	 my 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	and	destroy	 what 	 ever 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	with	 pin 	 point 	 	 accu 	 racy 	 	.
and	the	u.s.	 militar 	 y 	 	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	1.5	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	1940	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	.
and	to	put	that	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	the	total	cost	of	the	manhattan	project	was	three	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
half	 a 	 s 	 	much	money	was	 s 	 pent 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	 a 	 s 	 	was	 s 	 pent 	 	on	the	most	famous	 militar 	 y 	 	-	industrial	project	of	the	modern	era	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	people	,	 strategist 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	the	u.s.	 militar 	 y 	 	who	 genuine 	 ly 	 	thought	that	 th 	 is 	 	single	 de 	 vice 	 	was	going	to	spell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	defeat	and	 vict 	 ory 	 	when	it	came	to	the	battle	against	the	nazis	and	against	the	japanese	.
and	for	norden	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	had	 in 	 credible 	 	moral	 import 	 ance 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	norden	was	a	 commit 	 ted 	 	christian	.
in	fact	,	he	would	 al 	 ways 	 	get	 up 	 set 	 	when	people	 refer 	 red 	 	to	the	 bomb 	 sight 	 	 a 	 s 	 	his	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	his	 eye 	 s 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	god	could	invent	 thing 	 s 	 	.
he	was	simple	the	instrument	of	god	's	will	.
and	what	was	god	's	will	?
well	god	's	will	was	that	the	amount	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	in	any	kind	of	war	be	 reduc 	 ed 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	small	an	amount	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
and	what	did	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	do	?
well	it	 allow 	 ed 	 	you	to	do	that	.
it	 allow 	 ed 	 	you	to	bomb	 on 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	and	 want 	 ed 	 	to	bomb	.
so	in	the	 year 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	up	to	the	second	world	war	,	the	u.s.	 militar 	 y 	 	 buy 	 s 	 	90,000	of	these	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 s 	 	at	a	cost	of	$	14,000	each	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	1940	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	that	's	a	lot	of	money	.
and	they	trained	50,000	 bombard 	 ier 	 s 	 	on	how	to	use	them	--	long	 extens 	 ive 	 	,	 month 	 s 	 	-	long	training	 session 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	analog	 computer 	 s 	 	;	they	're	not	easy	to	use	.
and	they	make	 every 	 one 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 bombard 	 ier 	 s 	 	take	an	 oa 	 th 	 	,	to	 s 	 wear 	 	that	if	they	're	ever	 capture 	 d 	 	,	they	will	not	 div 	 ul 	 ge 	 	a	single	detail	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	to	the	 ene 	 my 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 imper 	 ative 	 	the	 ene 	 my 	 	not	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	essential	piece	of	technology	.
and	 when 	 ever 	 	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	is	taken	onto	a	plane	,	it	's	 es 	 cort 	 ed 	 	there	by	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 arm 	 ed 	 	 guard 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	carried	in	a	box	with	a	canvas	shroud	over	it	.
and	the	box	is	 hand 	 cuff 	 ed 	 	to	one	of	the	 guard 	 s 	 	.
it	's	never	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	be	 photograph 	 ed 	 	.
and	there	's	a	little	 incendi 	 ary 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	it	,	so	that	,	if	the	plane	ever	 crash 	 es 	 	,	it	will	be	 destroy 	 ed 	 	and	there	's	no	way	the	 ene 	 my 	 	can	ever	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	it	.
the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	is	the	holy	 g 	 rail 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	second	world	war	?
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	not	the	holy	 g 	 rail 	 	.
in	practice	,	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	can	drop	a	bomb	 in 	 to 	 	a	 pick 	 le 	 	barrel	at	20,000	ft.	,	but	that	's	under	perfect	 condition 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	in	 war 	 time 	 	,	 condition 	 s 	 	are	n't	perfect	.
first	of	all	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	use	--	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	use	.
and	not	all	of	the	people	who	are	of	 t 	 hose 	 	50,000	men	who	are	 bombard 	 ier 	 s 	 	have	the	ability	to	 proper 	 ly 	 	program	an	analog	computer	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	 break 	 s 	 	down	a	lot	.
it	's	full	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 gyros 	 cope 	 s 	 	and	 pul 	 ley 	 s 	 	and	 gadget 	 s 	 	and	ball	-	 bear 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	do	n't	work	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	they	ought	to	in	the	heat	of	battle	.
 third 	 ly 	 	,	when	norden	was	making	his	 calcul 	 ations 	 	,	he	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	a	plane	would	be	 fly 	 ing 	 	at	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	 s 	 low 	 	speed	at	low	 altitude 	 s 	 	.
well	in	a	real	war	,	you	ca	n't	do	that	;	you	'll	get	shot	down	.
so	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	them	at	high	 altitude 	 s 	 	at	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	high	 speed 	 s 	 	.
and	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 a 	 s 	 	well	under	 t 	 hose 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	.
but	most	of	all	,	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	the	 bombard 	 ier 	 	to	make	visual	contact	with	the	target	.
but	of	course	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	real	life	?
there	are	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	right	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	 cloud 	 less 	 	sky	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	accurate	.
well	how	 man 	 y 	 	 cloud 	 less 	 	 ski 	 es 	 	do	you	think	there	 we 	 re 	 	above	central	europe	between	1940	and	1945	?
not	a	lot	.
and	then	to	give	you	a	sense	of	just	how	 in 	 accurate 	 	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	was	,	there	was	a	famous	case	in	1944	where	the	 al 	 lies 	 	 bomb 	 ed 	 	a	chemical	plant	in	leuna	,	germany	.
and	the	chemical	plant	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	757	 acre 	 s 	 	.
and	over	the	course	of	22	 bomb 	 ing 	 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	the	 al 	 lies 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	85,000	 bomb 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	757	acre	chemical	plant	,	using	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	.
well	what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 bomb 	 s 	 	do	you	think	 actual 	 ly 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	700	-	acre	 peri 	 meter 	 	of	the	plant	?
10	percent	.	10	percent	.
and	of	 t 	 hose 	 	10	percent	that	 land 	 ed 	 	,	16	percent	did	n't	even	go	off	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 du 	 d 	 s 	 	.
the	leuna	chemical	plant	,	after	one	of	the	most	 extens 	 ive 	 	 bomb 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	war	,	was	up	and	running	 with 	 in 	 	 week 	 s 	 	.
and	by	the	way	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 pre 	 caution 	 s 	 	to	keep	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	out	of	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	the	nazis	?
well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	carl	norden	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	proper	swiss	,	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 ena 	 mor 	 ed 	 	of	german	 engineer 	 s 	 	.
so	in	the	1930s	,	he	 hire 	 d 	 	a	whole	bunch	of	them	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	a	man	named	hermann	long	who	,	in	1938	,	 g 	 ave 	 	a	complete	set	of	the	 plan 	 s 	 	for	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	to	the	nazis	.
so	they	had	 the 	 ir 	 	own	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	entire	war	--	which	 al 	 so 	 	,	by	the	way	,	did	n't	work	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
so	why	do	we	talk	about	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	?
well	 be 	 cause 	 	we	live	in	an	age	where	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 s 	 	.
we	live	in	a	time	where	there	are	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	people	running	around	,	 say 	 ing 	 	that	they	've	 invent 	 ed 	 	 gadget 	 s 	 	that	will	 fore 	 ver 	 	change	our	world	.
they	've	 invent 	 ed 	 	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	that	will	allow	people	to	be	free	.
they	've	 invent 	 ed 	 	some	kind	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	thing	that	will	make	our	world	 fore 	 ver 	 	better	.
if	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 militar 	 y 	 	,	you	'll	find	 lot 	 s 	 	of	carl	nordens	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
if	you	go	to	the	 pent 	 agon 	 	,	they	will	say	,	``	you	know	what	,	now	we	 re 	 ally 	 	can	put	a	bomb	 in 	 side 	 	a	 pick 	 le 	 	barrel	at	20,000	ft.	``
and	you	know	what	,	it	's	true	;	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	do	that	now	.
but	we	need	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	about	how	little	that	 mean 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	,	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	first	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	,	the	u.s.	 militar 	 y 	 	,	the	air	force	,	 s 	 ent 	 	two	 s 	 quad 	 ron 	 s 	 	of	f	-	15e	 fight 	 er 	 	 eagle 	 s 	 	to	the	iraqi	desert	 equi 	 pped 	 	with	these	five	million	dollar	 camera 	 s 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	them	to	see	the	entire	desert	floor	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	mission	was	to	find	and	to	destroy	--	remember	the	scud	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	 launch 	 ers 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	surface	-	to	-	air	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 s 	 	that	the	iraqis	 we 	 re 	 	 launch 	 ing 	 	at	the	israelis	?
the	mission	of	the	two	 s 	 quad 	 ron 	 s 	 	was	to	get	rid	of	all	the	scud	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	 launch 	 ers 	 	.
and	so	they	flew	 mission 	 s 	 	day	and	night	,	and	they	 drop 	 ped 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 bomb 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 fire 	 d 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 s 	 	in	an	attempt	to	get	rid	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 scour 	 ge 	 	.
and	after	the	war	was	over	,	there	was	an	audit	 d 	 one 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	the	 arm 	 y 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	the	air	force	 al 	 ways 	 	 do 	 es 	 	--	and	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	:	how	 man 	 y 	 	scuds	did	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	destroy	?
you	know	what	the	answer	was	?
zero	,	not	a	single	one	.
now	why	is	that	?
is	it	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	accurate	?
oh	no	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	accurate	.
they	could	have	 destroy 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	thing	right	here	from	25,000	ft	.
the	issue	was	they	did	n't	know	where	the	scud	 launch 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
the	problem	with	 bomb 	 s 	 	and	 pick 	 le 	 	 barrel 	 s 	 	is	not	 get 	 ting 	 	the	bomb	 in 	 side 	 	the	 pick 	 le 	 	barrel	,	it	's	 know 	 ing 	 	how	to	find	the	 pick 	 le 	 	barrel	.
that	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 hard 	 er 	 	problem	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 fight 	 ing 	 	 war 	 s 	 	.
or	take	the	battle	in	afghanistan	.
what	is	the	signature	weapon	of	the	cia	's	war	in	 north 	 west 	 	pakistan	?
it	's	the	drone	.	what	is	the	drone	?
well	it	is	the	 grand 	 son 	 	of	the	norden	mark	15	 bomb 	 sight 	 	.
it	is	 th 	 is 	 	weapon	of	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	 accu 	 racy 	 	and	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	.
and	over	the	course	of	the	last	six	 year 	 s 	 	in	 north 	 west 	 	pakistan	,	the	cia	 ha 	 s 	 	 flow 	 n 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	drone	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	used	 t 	 hose 	 	 drone 	 s 	 	to	kill	2,000	 suspect 	 ed 	 	pakistani	and	taliban	 militant 	 s 	 	.
now	what	is	the	 accu 	 racy 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 drone 	 s 	 	?
well	it	's	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
we	think	we	're	now	at	95	percent	 accu 	 racy 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	drone	 strike 	 s 	 	.
95	percent	of	the	people	we	kill	need	to	be	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	right	?
that	is	one	of	the	most	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 record 	 s 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	modern	 war 	 fare 	 	.
but	do	you	know	what	the	 cruci 	 al 	 	thing	is	?
in	that	exact	same	period	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	using	these	 drone 	 s 	 	with	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	 accu 	 racy 	 	,	the	number	of	 attack 	 s 	 	,	of	 su 	 icide 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	and	terrorist	 attack 	 s 	 	,	against	american	 force 	 s 	 	in	afghanistan	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 ten 	 fold 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	have	gotten	more	and	more	efficient	in	 kill 	 ing 	 	them	,	they	have	 be 	 come 	 	 ang 	 rier 	 	and	 ang 	 rier 	 	and	more	and	more	 motiv 	 ated 	 	to	kill	us	.
i	have	not	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	you	a	success	story	.
i	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	you	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	a	success	story	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	problem	with	our	 infatu 	 ation 	 	with	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	make	.
we	think	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	make	can	solve	our	 problem 	 s 	 	,	but	our	 problem 	 s 	 	are	much	more	complex	than	that	.
the	issue	is	n't	the	 accu 	 racy 	 	of	the	 bomb 	 s 	 	you	have	,	it	's	how	you	use	the	 bomb 	 s 	 	you	have	,	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	ought	to	use	 bomb 	 s 	 	at	all	.
there	's	a	 post 	 script 	 	to	the	norden	story	of	carl	norden	and	his	fabulous	 bomb 	 sight 	 	.
and	that	is	,	on	august	6th	,	1945	,	a	b	-	29	 bomb 	 er 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	enola	 ga 	 y 	 	flew	over	japan	and	,	using	a	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	,	 drop 	 ped 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 thermo 	 nuclear 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	on	the	city	of	hiroshima	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	was	typical	with	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	,	the	bomb	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	target	by	800	ft	.
but	of	course	,	it	did	n't	matter	.
and	that	's	the	 great 	 est 	 	 iron 	 y 	 	of	all	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	norden	 bomb 	 sight 	 	.
the	air	force	's	1.5	billion	dollar	 bomb 	 sight 	 	was	used	to	drop	 it 	 s 	 	three	billion	dollar	bomb	,	which	did	n't	need	a	 bomb 	 sight 	 	at	all	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	back	in	new	york	,	no	one	told	carl	norden	that	his	 bomb 	 sight 	 	was	used	over	hiroshima	.
he	was	a	 commit 	 ted 	 	christian	.
he	thought	he	had	designed	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	toll	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	in	war	.
it	would	have	broken	his	heart	.
