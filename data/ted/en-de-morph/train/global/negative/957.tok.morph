let	's	start	with	day	and	night	.
life	 evolv 	 ed 	 	under	 condition 	 s 	 	of	light	and	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	light	and	then	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
and	so	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	internal	 clock 	 s 	 	so	that	they	would	be	ready	for	these	 change 	 s 	 	in	light	.
these	are	chemical	 clock 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	found	in	every	known	 be 	 ing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	two	or	more	 cell 	 s 	 	and	in	some	that	 on 	 ly 	 	have	one	cell	.
i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	if	you	take	a	 horse 	 shoe 	 	crab	off	the	beach	,	and	you	fly	it	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	continent	,	and	you	drop	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 slop 	 ed 	 	cage	,	it	will	scramble	up	the	floor	of	the	cage	 a 	 s 	 	the	tide	is	 ris 	 ing 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	home	 shore 	 s 	 	,	and	it	'll	 s 	 kit 	 ter 	 	down	 aga 	 in 	 	right	 a 	 s 	 	the	water	is	 reced 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
it	'll	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	 week 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	kind	of	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	the	plot	.
and	it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	to	watch	,	but	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 psych 	 ic 	 	or	 para 	 normal 	 	going	on	;	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	that	these	 crab 	 s 	 	have	internal	 cycle 	 s 	 	that	correspond	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	with	what	's	going	on	around	it	.
so	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	ability	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	call	it	the	``	body	clock	.	``
you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	most	 clear 	 ly 	 	when	you	take	away	 some 	 one 	 	's	watch	and	you	shut	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	 bunk 	 er 	 	,	deep	 under 	 ground 	 	,	for	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	.
people	 actual 	 ly 	 	volunteer	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	 usual 	 ly 	 	come	out	kind	of	 r 	 av 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	productive	time	in	the	hole	.
so	,	no	matter	how	 a 	 typical 	 	these	 subject 	 s 	 	would	have	to	be	,	they	all	show	the	same	thing	.
they	get	up	just	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	every	day	--	say	15	 minute 	 s 	 	or	so	--	and	they	kind	of	drift	all	the	way	around	the	clock	like	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	course	of	the	 week 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	we	know	that	they	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	internal	 clock 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 some 	 how 	 	 sens 	 ing 	 	the	day	 out 	 side 	 	.
so	fine	,	we	have	a	body	clock	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	huge	driver	for	culture	and	i	think	that	it	's	the	most	 under 	 rated 	 	force	on	our	behavior	.
we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	near	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	,	and	so	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	 equi 	 pped 	 	to	deal	with	12	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 day 	 light 	 	and	12	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
but	of	course	,	we	've	spread	to	every	corner	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	and	in	 arc 	 tic 	 	canada	,	where	i	live	,	we	have	 perpetu 	 al 	 	 day 	 light 	 	in	summer	and	24	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	in	winter	.
so	the	culture	,	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 ab 	 original 	 	culture	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 season 	 al 	 	.
in	winter	,	there	's	a	lot	of	 sleep 	 ing 	 	going	on	;	you	enjoy	your	family	life	 in 	 side 	 	.
and	in	summer	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 man 	 ic 	 	 hunt 	 ing 	 	and	 work 	 ing 	 	activity	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 hour 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	active	.
so	,	what	would	our	natural	rhythm	look	like	?
what	would	our	 sleep 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	be	in	the	sort	of	ideal	sense	?
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	when	people	are	living	 with 	 out 	 	any	sort	of	artificial	light	at	all	,	they	sleep	twice	every	night	.
they	go	to	bed	around	8:00	p.m	.
 un 	 til 	 	 mid 	 night 	 	and	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	sleep	from	about	2:00	 a.m 	 . 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 s 	 un 	 rise 	 	.
and	in	-	between	,	they	have	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	sort	of	 medit 	 ative 	 	quiet	in	bed	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	there	's	a	 s 	 urge 	 	of	 pro 	 lac 	 tin 	 	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	a	modern	day	never	 s 	 ees 	 	.
the	people	in	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	report	 feel 	 ing 	 	so	awake	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 day 	 time 	 	,	that	they	 real 	 ize 	 	they	're	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	true	 wake 	 fulness 	 	for	the	first	time	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	,	cut	to	the	modern	day	.
we	're	living	in	a	culture	of	jet	lag	,	global	travel	,	24	-	hour	business	,	shift	work	.
and	you	know	,	our	modern	ways	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 advantage 	 s 	 	,	but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	understand	the	 cost 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
