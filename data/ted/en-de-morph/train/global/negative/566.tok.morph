 th 	 is 	 	is	a	world	-	changing	 invent 	 ion 	 	.
the	smoke	alarm	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	,	 world 	 wide 	 	.
but	smoke	 alarm 	 s 	 	do	n't	prevent	 fire 	 s 	 	.
every	year	in	the	usa	,	over	20,000	are	 kill 	 ed 	 	or	 inju 	 red 	 	with	350,000	home	 fire 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	main	 cause 	 s 	 	of	all	these	 fire 	 s 	 	is	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
what	if	we	could	prevent	 electric 	 al 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	before	they	start	?
well	,	a	couple	of	 friend 	 s 	 	and	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	ignite	 resident 	 ial 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	?
well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	main	 cause 	 s 	 	are	 fault 	 y 	 	and	 mis 	 used 	 	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	and	 electric 	 al 	 	wiring	.
our	 invent 	 ion 	 	had	to	address	all	of	these	 issue 	 s 	 	.
so	what	about	circuit	 breaker 	 s 	 	?
well	,	thomas	edison	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	circuit	breaker	in	1879	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	130	-	year	-	old	technology	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	over	80	percent	of	all	home	 electric 	 al 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	start	 be 	 low 	 	the	 safe 	 ty 	 	threshold	of	circuit	 breaker 	 s 	 	.
 h 	 mmm 	 	...
so	we	 consider 	 ed 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 electric 	 al 	 	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	must	be	able	to	communicate	 direct 	 ly 	 	with	the	power	receptacle	 it 	 self 	 	.
any	 electric 	 al 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	--	an	 appli 	 ance 	 	,	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	cord	,	 what 	 ever 	 	--	must	be	able	to	tell	the	power	 out 	 let 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	power	 out 	 let 	 	,	i	'm	 draw 	 ing 	 	too	much	current	.	shut	me	off	now	,	before	i	start	a	fire	.	``
and	the	power	 out 	 let 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	to	do	it	.
so	here	is	what	we	did	.	we	put	a	10	-	cent	digital	 trans 	 ponder 	 	,	a	data	tag	,	in	the	 appli 	 ance 	 	plug	.
and	we	put	an	 in 	 expensive 	 	,	 wire 	 less 	 	data	 read 	 er 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	receptacle	so	they	could	communicate	.
now	,	every	home	 electric 	 al 	 	system	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	intelligent	network	.
the	 appli 	 ance 	 	's	safe	 oper 	 ating 	 	 parameter 	 s 	 	are	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	plug	.
if	too	much	current	is	 flow 	 ing 	 	,	the	intelligent	receptacle	 turn 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	off	,	and	 prevent 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	fire	from	 start 	 ing 	 	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	technology	efci	,	 electric 	 al 	 	fault	circuit	interrupter	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	two	more	 point 	 s 	 	.	every	year	in	the	usa	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	2,500	children	are	admitted	to	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	rooms	for	shock	and	burn	 inju 	 ries 	 	related	to	 electric 	 al 	 	 receptacle 	 s 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	crazy	.
an	intelligent	receptacle	 prevent 	 s 	 	 inju 	 ries 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	power	is	 al 	 ways 	 	off	,	 un 	 til 	 	an	intelligent	plug	is	 detect 	 ed 	 	.	simple	.
now	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	saving	 live 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	benefit	of	intelligent	power	is	in	 it 	 s 	 	energy	 saving 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 invent 	 ion 	 	will	 reduc 	 e 	 	global	energy	consumption	by	 allow 	 ing 	 	remote	control	and	 autom 	 ation 	 	of	every	 out 	 let 	 	in	every	home	and	business	.
now	you	can	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	your	home	energy	bill	by	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 cycl 	 ing 	 	heavy	 load 	 s 	 	like	air	 condition 	 ers 	 	and	 heat 	 ers 	 	.
 hotel 	 s 	 	and	 business 	 es 	 	can	shut	down	 un 	 used 	 	rooms	from	a	central	location	,	or	even	a	cell	phone	.
there	are	10	billion	 electric 	 al 	 	 out 	 lets 	 	in	north	america	 al 	 one 	 	.
the	potential	energy	 saving 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	.
so	far	we	've	 appli 	 ed 	 	for	414	patent	 claim 	 s 	 	.
of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	186	have	 be 	 en 	 	 grant 	 ed 	 	:	228	are	in	process	.
and	i	'm	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	announce	that	just	three	 week 	 s 	 	ago	we	 receiv 	 ed 	 	our	first	 inter 	 national 	 	 re 	 cognition 	 	,	the	2009	ces	 innov 	 ation 	 	 a 	 ward 	 	.
so	,	to	conclude	,	intelligent	power	can	,	 global 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 ave 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	,	prevent	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 inju 	 ries 	 	,	and	eliminate	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 proper 	 ty 	 	damage	every	single	year	,	while	 significant 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 ing 	 	global	energy	consumption	.
in	the	spirit	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	's	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	,	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 power 	 ful 	 	,	world	-	changing	 invent 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	'd	like	to	thank	chris	for	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	unveil	our	technology	with	you	,	and	soon	the	world	.
thank	you	.
