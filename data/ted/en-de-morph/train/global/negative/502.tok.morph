i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	 para 	 gliding 	 	.
 para 	 gliding 	 	is	taking	off	from	 mountain 	 s 	 	with	a	 para 	 glider 	 	,	with	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	fly	cross	-	country	,	distance	,	just	with	the	use	of	 thermal 	 s 	 	to	soar	.
 al 	 so 	 	different	aerobatic	 maneuver 	 s 	 	are	possible	with	a	 para 	 glider 	 	.
from	there	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	you	can	see	there	is	a	four	-	way	skydive	,	four	people	 fly 	 ing 	 	together	,	and	on	the	left	hand	side	it	's	the	camera	 fly 	 er 	 	with	the	camera	 mount 	 ed 	 	to	his	helmet	so	he	can	film	the	whole	jump	,	for	the	film	 it 	 self 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	for	the	 judg 	 ing 	 	.
from	regular	,	 relat 	 ive 	 	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	i	went	on	to	 free 	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
 free 	 fly 	 ing 	 	is	more	the	three	-	dimensional	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	see	the	 skydive 	 r 	 	with	the	red	suit	,	he	's	in	a	stand	-	up	position	.
the	one	with	the	yellow	-	green	suit	,	he	's	 fly 	 ing 	 	head	-	down	.
and	that	's	me	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	 carv 	 ing 	 	around	the	whole	 form 	 ation 	 	in	 free 	 fall 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	with	the	helmet	cam	to	film	 th 	 is 	 	jump	.
from	 free 	 fly 	 ing 	 	i	went	on	to	 sky 	 surfing 	 	.
 sky 	 surfing 	 	is	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	with	a	board	on	the	feet	.
you	can	imagine	with	 th 	 is 	 	big	surface	of	a	 sky 	 surfing 	 	board	,	there	is	a	lot	of	force	,	a	lot	of	power	.
of	course	i	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	power	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	for	nice	 s 	 pinning 	 	--	we	call	it	``	helicopter	 move 	 s 	 	.	``
from	there	i	went	on	to	 wing 	 suit 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
 wing 	 suit 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	is	a	suit	,	that	i	can	make	fly	,	just	 on 	 ly 	 	with	my	body	.
if	i	put	some	tension	on	my	body	,	tension	on	my	suit	,	i	can	make	it	fly	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	the	fall	rate	is	much	much	 s 	 lower 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 big 	 ger 	 	surface	.
with	a	proper	body	position	i	'm	able	to	 re 	 ally 	 	move	forward	to	gain	 quit 	 e 	 	some	distance	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	jump	i	did	in	rio	de	janeiro	.
you	can	see	the	copacabana	on	the	left	-	hand	side	.
from	there	with	all	the	 skill 	 s 	 	and	knowledge	from	 para 	 gliding 	 	and	all	the	different	 discipline 	 s 	 	in	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	,	i	went	on	to	base	 jump 	 ing 	 	.
base	 jump 	 ing 	 	is	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	from	 fix 	 ed 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	like	 building 	 s 	 	,	 antenna 	 e 	 	,	 bridge 	 s 	 	and	earth	--	meaning	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	 cliff 	 s 	 	.
it	's	for	 s 	 ure 	 	--	for	me	--	it	's	the	ultimate	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	free	fall	,	with	all	the	visual	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	.
so	my	goal	soon	was	to	discover	new	 place 	 s 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	had	 jump 	 ed 	 	before	.
so	in	summer	2000	i	was	the	first	to	base	jump	the	eiger	north	face	in	switzerland	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	was	the	first	to	base	jump	from	matterhorn	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	mountain	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	in	here	.
2005	i	did	a	base	jump	from	the	eiger	,	from	the	monk	and	from	the	jungfrau	,	three	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	 mountain 	 s 	 	in	switzerland	.
the	special	thing	on	these	three	 jump 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	i	 hik 	 ed 	 	them	all	and	 climb 	 ed 	 	them	all	in	 on 	 ly 	 	one	day	.
in	2008	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	the	eiffel	tower	in	paris	.
so	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	 stunt 	 s 	 	.
so	with	some	 friend 	 s 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	different	 trick 	 s 	 	,	like	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	 th 	 is 	 	jump	here	,	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	from	a	 para 	 glider 	 	.
or	here	--	 every 	 body 	 	was	freezing	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	in	austria	where	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	 film 	 ing 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	basket	,	and	i	was	on	top	of	the	balloon	,	ready	to	slide	down	with	my	 sky 	 surf 	 	board	.
or	 th 	 is 	 	jump	,	from	a	moving	truck	on	the	 high 	 way 	 	.
 extrem 	 e 	 	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	on	top	level	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	possible	if	you	practice	step	by	step	,	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	work	hard	on	your	 skill 	 s 	 	and	on	your	knowledge	.
of	course	you	need	to	be	in	physical	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	,	condition	,	so	i	'm	training	a	lot	.
you	need	to	have	the	best	possible	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
and	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	is	you	have	to	work	on	your	mental	 skill 	 s 	 	,	mental	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	.
and	all	 th 	 is 	 	to	come	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	possible	to	the	human	dream	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	fly	.
so	for	2009	,	i	'm	training	hard	for	my	two	new	 project 	 s 	 	.
the	first	one	,	i	want	to	set	a	world	record	in	 fly 	 ing 	 	from	a	cliff	with	my	 wing 	 suit 	 	.
and	i	want	to	set	a	new	record	,	with	the	 long 	 est 	 	distance	ever	 flow 	 n 	 	.
for	my	second	project	,	i	have	a	sensational	idea	of	a	jump	that	never	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	before	.
so	now	,	on	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	movie	you	will	see	that	i	'm	much	better	in	 fly 	 ing 	 	a	 wing 	 suit 	 	than	 s 	 peaking 	 	in	english	.
enjoy	,	and	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
june	cohen	:	i	have	some	 question 	 s 	 	.
i	think	we	all	might	have	some	 question 	 s 	 	.
question	one	:	so	 do 	 es 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	the	way	the	 fly 	 ing 	 	dream	 do 	 es 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	might	.
ueli	gegenschatz	:	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	.	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 close 	 st 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	come	to	the	dream	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	fly	.
jc	:	i	know	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	how	do	you	land	?
ue	:	 parachut 	 e 	 	.	we	have	to	open	a	 parachut 	 e 	 	just	 second 	 s 	 	before	,	i	would	say	,	impact	.
it	's	not	possible	to	land	a	 wing 	 suit 	 	yet	.
jc	:	yet	.	but	people	are	 try 	 ing 	 	.	are	you	among	 t 	 hose 	 	--	you	're	not	going	to	commit	--	are	you	among	 t 	 hose 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	it	?
ue	:	it	's	a	dream	.	it	's	a	dream	.	 yea 	 h 	 	.
we	're	still	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	and	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	 wing 	 suit 	 s 	 	to	get	better	performance	,	to	get	more	knowledge	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	soon	.
jc	:	all	right	.	well	we	will	watch	 th 	 is 	 	space	.	but	i	have	two	more	 question 	 s 	 	.
what	is	the	--	there	was	exhaust	coming	out	of	the	back	of	the	 wing 	 suit 	 	.	was	that	a	 propel 	 led 	 	 wing 	 suit 	 	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	?
ue	:	nope	.	it	's	just	smoke	.
jc	:	coming	off	of	you	?
ue	:	 hope 	 fully 	 	not	.
jc	:	that	 seem 	 s 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
ue	:	no	,	smoke	is	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	the	speed	,	you	can	see	the	way	where	i	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	reason	number	one	.	and	reason	number	two	:	it	's	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	the	camera	guy	to	film	if	i	'm	using	smoke	.
jc	:	ah	,	i	see	.	so	the	 wing 	 suit 	 	is	set	up	to	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	 re 	 lease 	 	smoke	so	that	you	can	be	 track 	 ed 	 	.	one	more	question	.
what	do	you	do	to	to	cover	your	face	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	just	keep	 think 	 ing 	 	of	going	that	fast	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	your	whole	face	 s 	 mush 	 ed 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
are	you	in	a	helmet	?	are	you	in	 go 	 gg 	 les 	 	?
ue	:	the	 pur 	 est 	 	and	the	best	 feel 	 ing 	 	would	be	with	 on 	 ly 	 	 go 	 gg 	 les 	 	.
jc	:	and	is	that	how	you	 usual 	 ly 	 	fly	?
ue	:	 usual 	 ly 	 	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	helmet	.	in	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	helmet	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 land 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	 usual 	 ly 	 	it	's	difficult	--	it	's	not	like	regular	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	where	you	have	like	the	big	 land 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
so	you	have	to	be	prepared	.
jc	:	right	.	now	is	there	 any 	 thing 	 	you	do	n't	do	?
do	people	come	to	you	with	 project 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	we	want	you	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	!	``
and	do	you	ever	say	,	``	no	,	no	i	'm	not	going	to	.	``
ue	:	oh	of	course	,	of	course	.	some	people	have	crazy	 idea 	 s 	 	and	--	jc	:	...	a	round	of	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	...
ue	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
