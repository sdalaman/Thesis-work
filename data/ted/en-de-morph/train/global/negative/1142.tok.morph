thank	you	.
i	'm	 thrill 	 ed 	 	to	be	here	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	a	new	,	old	material	that	still	 continu 	 es 	 	to	amaze	us	,	and	that	might	impact	the	way	we	think	about	material	science	,	high	technology	--	and	 may 	 be 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	,	 al 	 so 	 	do	some	stuff	for	medicine	and	for	global	health	and	help	 re 	 forest 	 ation 	 	.
so	that	's	kind	of	a	bold	 state 	 ment 	 	.
i	'll	tell	you	a	little	bit	more	.
 th 	 is 	 	material	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 trait 	 s 	 	that	make	it	seem	 al 	 most 	 	too	good	to	be	true	.
it	's	 sustain 	 able 	 	;	it	's	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	material	that	is	 process 	 ed 	 	all	in	water	and	at	room	temperature	--	and	is	 bio 	 degradable 	 	with	a	clock	,	so	you	can	watch	it	 dis 	 solve 	 	 instantaneous 	 ly 	 	in	a	glass	of	water	or	have	it	 s 	 table 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 ed 	 ible 	 	;	it	's	 implant 	 able 	 	in	the	human	body	 with 	 out 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	any	 immun 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 integrate 	 d 	 	in	the	body	.
and	it	's	 techno 	 logical 	 	,	so	it	can	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 micro 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	 photo 	 nic 	 s 	 	do	.
and	the	material	 look 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	material	you	see	is	clear	and	 trans 	 parent 	 	.
the	 component 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	material	are	just	water	and	protein	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	material	is	silk	.
so	it	's	kind	of	different	from	what	we	're	used	to	 think 	 ing 	 	about	silk	.
so	the	question	is	,	how	do	you	 re 	 invent 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	five	millennia	?
the	process	of	 discover 	 y 	 	,	 general 	 ly 	 	,	is	inspired	by	nature	.
and	so	we	marvel	at	silk	 worm 	 s 	 	--	the	silk	worm	you	see	here	 s 	 pinning 	 	 it 	 s 	 	fiber	.
the	silk	worm	 do 	 es 	 	a	 remark 	 able 	 	thing	:	it	uses	these	two	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	protein	and	water	,	that	are	in	 it 	 s 	 	 g 	 land 	 	,	to	make	a	material	that	is	 exception 	 ally 	 	tough	for	 protect 	 ion 	 	--	so	 compar 	 able 	 	to	technical	 fiber 	 s 	 	like	kevlar	.
and	so	in	the	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	process	that	we	know	about	,	and	that	we	're	familiar	with	,	for	the	 text 	 ile 	 	industry	,	the	 text 	 ile 	 	industry	 go 	 es 	 	and	 un 	 wind 	 s 	 	the	cocoon	and	then	 weave 	 s 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	want	to	know	how	you	go	from	water	and	protein	to	 th 	 is 	 	liquid	kevlar	,	to	 th 	 is 	 	natural	kevlar	.
so	the	 in 	 sight 	 	is	how	do	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	reverse	engineer	 th 	 is 	 	and	go	from	cocoon	to	 g 	 land 	 	and	get	water	and	protein	that	is	your	 start 	 ing 	 	material	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 sight 	 	that	came	,	about	two	 decade 	 s 	 	ago	,	from	a	person	that	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	fortunate	to	work	with	,	david	kaplan	.
and	so	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	material	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	material	is	back	to	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	building	block	.
and	then	we	use	 th 	 is 	 	to	do	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	like	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	film	.
and	we	take	advantage	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
the	recipe	to	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 film 	 s 	 	is	to	take	advantage	of	the	fact	that	 protein 	 s 	 	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	smart	at	what	they	do	.
they	find	 the 	 ir 	 	way	to	self	-	assemble	.
so	the	recipe	is	simple	:	you	take	the	silk	solution	,	you	pour	it	,	and	you	wait	for	the	protein	to	self	-	assemble	.
and	then	you	detach	the	protein	and	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	film	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 protein 	 s 	 	find	each	other	 a 	 s 	 	the	water	 evapo 	 rates 	 	.
but	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	that	the	film	is	 al 	 so 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	.
and	so	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	can	 inter 	 face 	 	it	with	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	typical	of	technology	,	like	 micro 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	 nano 	 scale 	 	technology	.
and	the	image	of	the	dvd	here	is	just	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	a	point	that	silk	 follow 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	subtle	 top 	 ographies 	 	of	the	surface	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	can	replicate	 feature 	 s 	 	on	the	 nano 	 scale 	 	.
so	it	would	be	able	to	replicate	the	information	that	is	on	the	dvd	.
and	we	can	store	information	that	's	film	with	water	and	protein	.
so	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	out	,	and	we	wrote	a	 mess 	 age 	 	in	a	piece	of	silk	,	which	is	right	here	,	and	the	 mess 	 age 	 	is	over	there	.
and	much	like	in	the	dvd	,	you	can	read	it	out	 optical 	 ly 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	a	 s 	 table 	 	hand	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	it	 on 	 stage 	 	in	front	of	a	thousand	people	.
so	let	me	see	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	the	film	go	in	 trans 	 parent 	 ly 	 	through	there	,	and	then	...
and	the	most	 remark 	 able 	 	feat	is	that	my	hand	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	still	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	do	that	.
so	once	you	have	these	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	material	,	then	you	can	do	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	 film 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	material	can	 assum 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 format 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	go	a	little	crazy	,	and	so	you	do	 vari 	 ous 	 	optical	 component 	 s 	 	or	you	do	 micro 	 prism 	 	 array 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 reflect 	 ive 	 	tape	that	you	have	on	your	running	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
or	you	can	do	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	,	if	the	camera	can	capture	,	you	can	make	.
you	can	add	a	third	 dimensional 	 ity 	 	to	the	film	.
and	if	the	angle	is	right	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	a	 holo 	 gram 	 	appear	in	 th 	 is 	 	film	of	silk	.
but	you	can	do	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	can	imagine	that	then	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	use	a	 pur 	 e 	 	protein	to	guide	light	,	and	so	we	've	made	optical	 fiber 	 s 	 	.
but	silk	is	 versa 	 tile 	 	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	beyond	 optic 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	think	of	different	 format 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	if	you	're	 af 	 raid 	 	of	going	to	the	doctor	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	a	needle	,	we	do	 micro 	 needle 	 	 array 	 s 	 	.
what	you	see	there	on	the	screen	is	a	human	hair	 super 	 impose 	 d 	 	on	the	needle	that	's	made	of	silk	--	just	to	give	you	a	sense	of	 s 	 ize 	 	.
you	can	do	 big 	 ger 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	can	do	 gear 	 s 	 	and	nuts	and	 bolt 	 s 	 	--	that	you	can	buy	at	whole	 food 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 gear 	 s 	 	work	in	water	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	you	think	of	 alter 	 native 	 	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	use	that	liquid	kevlar	if	you	need	 some 	 thing 	 	strong	to	replace	 per 	 iph 	 er 	 al 	 	 vein 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	an	entire	bone	.
and	so	you	have	here	a	little	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	small	skull	--	what	we	call	mini	yorick	.
but	you	can	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 cup 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	and	so	,	if	you	add	a	little	bit	of	gold	,	if	you	add	a	little	bit	of	 semi 	 conductor 	 s 	 	you	could	do	 sensor 	 s 	 	that	stick	on	the	 surface 	 s 	 	of	 food 	 s 	 	.
you	can	do	 electron 	 ic 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	that	fold	and	wrap	.
or	if	you	're	fashion	forward	,	some	silk	led	 tattoo 	 s 	 	.
so	there	's	 versa 	 t 	 ility 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	,	in	the	material	 format 	 s 	 	,	that	you	can	do	with	silk	.
but	there	are	still	some	 un 	 ique 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	why	would	you	want	to	do	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	for	real	?
i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	it	 brief 	 ly 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	;	the	protein	is	 bio 	 degradable 	 	and	 bio 	 compatible 	 	.
and	you	see	here	a	picture	of	a	tissue	section	.
and	so	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	,	that	it	's	 bio 	 degradable 	 	and	 bio 	 compatible 	 	?
you	can	implant	it	in	the	body	 with 	 out 	 	 need 	 ing 	 	to	retrieve	what	is	 implant 	 ed 	 	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	all	the	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	before	and	all	the	 format 	 s 	 	,	in	principle	,	can	be	 implant 	 ed 	 	and	disappear	.
and	what	you	see	there	in	that	tissue	section	,	in	fact	,	is	you	see	that	 reflect 	 or 	 	tape	.
so	,	much	like	you	're	 s 	 een 	 	at	night	by	a	car	,	then	the	idea	is	that	you	can	see	,	if	you	illuminate	tissue	,	you	can	see	 deep 	 er 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	tissue	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	that	 reflect 	 ive 	 	tape	there	that	is	made	out	of	silk	.
and	you	see	there	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 integrate 	 d 	 	in	tissue	.
and	 re 	 integ 	 ration 	 	in	the	human	body	is	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	,	but	 re 	 integ 	 ration 	 	in	the	environment	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
so	you	have	a	clock	,	you	have	protein	,	and	now	a	silk	cup	like	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 throw 	 n 	 	away	 with 	 out 	 	guilt	--	 un 	 like 	 	the	 poly 	 styrene 	 	 cup 	 s 	 	that	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	fill	our	 land 	 fill 	 s 	 	 every 	 day 	 	.
it	's	 ed 	 ible 	 	,	so	you	can	do	smart	 pack 	 aging 	 	around	food	that	you	can	cook	with	the	food	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	taste	good	,	so	i	'm	going	to	need	some	help	with	that	.
but	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 remark 	 able 	 	thing	is	that	it	 come 	 s 	 	full	circle	.
silk	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	process	,	 act 	 s 	 	like	a	cocoon	for	 bio 	 logical 	 	matter	.
and	so	if	you	change	the	recipe	,	and	you	add	 thing 	 s 	 	when	you	pour	--	so	you	add	 thing 	 s 	 	to	your	liquid	silk	solution	--	where	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 enzyme 	 s 	 	or	 anti 	 bodies 	 	or	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	the	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	process	 preserve 	 s 	 	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	function	of	these	 do 	 pants 	 	.
so	it	 make 	 s 	 	the	 material 	 s 	 	 environment 	 ally 	 	active	and	 inter 	 active 	 	.
so	that	screw	that	you	thought	about	 before 	 hand 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	used	to	screw	a	bone	together	--	a	 fracture 	 d 	 	bone	together	--	and	deliver	 drug 	 s 	 	at	the	same	,	while	your	bone	is	 heal 	 ing 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
or	you	could	put	 drug 	 s 	 	in	your	wallet	and	not	in	your	 f 	 ridge 	 	.
so	we	've	made	a	silk	card	with	 pen 	 icillin 	 	in	it	.
and	we	 store 	 d 	 	 pen 	 icillin 	 	at	60	 degree 	 s 	 	c	,	so	140	 degree 	 s 	 	fahrenheit	,	for	two	 month 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	loss	of	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	of	the	 pen 	 icillin 	 	.
and	so	that	could	be	--	-	that	could	be	 potential 	 ly 	 	a	good	 alter 	 native 	 	to	solar	powered	 refrige 	 rated 	 	 camel 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	there	's	no	use	in	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	if	you	ca	n't	use	[	it	]	.
and	so	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	other	 un 	 ique 	 	material	trait	that	these	 material 	 s 	 	have	,	that	they	're	 programm 	 ably 	 	degradable	.
and	so	what	you	see	there	is	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
in	the	top	,	you	have	a	film	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 programm 	 ed 	 	not	to	 de 	 grade 	 	,	and	in	the	bottom	,	a	film	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 programm 	 ed 	 	to	 de 	 grade 	 	in	water	.
and	what	you	see	is	that	the	film	on	the	bottom	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	what	is	 in 	 side 	 	it	.
so	it	 allow 	 s 	 	for	the	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	of	what	we	've	 store 	 d 	 	before	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	for	a	controlled	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	 drug 	 s 	 	and	for	 re 	 integ 	 ration 	 	in	the	environment	in	all	of	these	 format 	 s 	 	that	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	.
so	the	 th 	 read 	 	of	 discover 	 y 	 	that	we	have	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	 th 	 read 	 	.
we	're	 im 	 pass 	 ion 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	to	do	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	want	to	replace	a	vein	or	a	bone	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	be	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	in	 micro 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	drink	a	coffee	in	a	cup	and	throw	it	away	 with 	 out 	 	guilt	,	 may 	 be 	 	carry	your	 drug 	 s 	 	in	your	pocket	,	deliver	them	 in 	 side 	 	your	body	or	deliver	them	 a 	 cross 	 	the	desert	,	the	answer	may	be	in	a	 th 	 read 	 	of	silk	.
thank	you	.
