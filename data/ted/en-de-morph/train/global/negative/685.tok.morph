we	grew	up	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	the	physical	 object 	 s 	 	around	us	.
there	are	an	enormous	number	of	them	that	we	use	every	day	.
 un 	 like 	 	most	of	our	computing	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	these	 object 	 s 	 	are	much	more	 f 	 un 	 	to	use	.
when	you	talk	about	 object 	 s 	 	,	one	other	thing	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	that	thing	,	and	that	is	 gest 	 ures 	 	:	how	we	 manipul 	 ate 	 	these	 object 	 s 	 	,	how	we	use	these	 object 	 s 	 	in	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
we	use	 gest 	 ures 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	interact	with	these	 object 	 s 	 	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	use	them	to	interact	with	each	other	.
a	 gest 	 ure 	 	of	``	namaste	!	``	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	to	respect	 some 	 one 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	--	in	india	i	do	n't	need	to	teach	a	kid	that	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	``	four	 run 	 s 	 	``	in	cricket	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	part	of	our	 every 	 day 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	i	am	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	that	how	--	how	our	knowledge	about	 every 	 day 	 	 object 	 s 	 	and	 gest 	 ures 	 	,	and	how	we	use	these	 object 	 s 	 	,	can	be	 leverage 	 d 	 	to	our	 interact 	 ions 	 	with	the	digital	world	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	using	a	 key 	 board 	 	and	mouse	,	why	can	i	not	use	my	computer	in	the	same	way	that	i	interact	in	the	physical	world	?
so	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	exploration	around	eight	 year 	 s 	 	back	,	and	it	 liter 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	mouse	on	my	desk	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	using	it	for	my	computer	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	it	.
most	of	you	might	be	aware	that	,	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	the	mouse	used	to	come	with	a	ball	 in 	 side 	 	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 roller 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	guide	the	computer	where	the	ball	is	moving	,	and	,	 accord 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	where	the	mouse	is	moving	.
so	,	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	these	two	 roller 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	more	,	so	i	 borrow 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	mouse	from	a	friend	--	never	 return 	 ed 	 	to	him	--	and	i	now	had	four	 roller 	 s 	 	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	what	i	did	with	these	 roller 	 s 	 	is	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	took	them	off	of	these	 mouse 	 s 	 	and	then	put	them	in	one	line	.
it	had	some	 string 	 s 	 	and	 pul 	 ley 	 s 	 	and	some	 spring 	 s 	 	.
what	i	got	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 gest 	 ure 	 	 inter 	 face 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	motion	-	 sens 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	made	for	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	,	here	,	 what 	 ever 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	i	do	in	my	physical	world	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 replicate 	 d 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	digital	world	just	using	 th 	 is 	 	small	 de 	 vice 	 	that	i	made	,	around	eight	 year 	 s 	 	back	,	in	2000	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 integ 	 rating 	 	these	two	 world 	 s 	 	,	i	thought	of	 stick 	 y 	 	 note 	 s 	 	.
i	thought	,	``	why	can	i	not	connect	the	normal	 inter 	 face 	 	of	a	physical	 stick 	 y 	 	note	to	the	digital	world	?	``
a	 mess 	 age 	 	written	on	a	 stick 	 y 	 	note	to	my	mom	can	come	to	an	sms	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 sync 	 s 	 	with	my	digital	calendar	--	a	to	-	do	list	that	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 sync 	 s 	 	with	you	.
but	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	search	in	the	digital	world	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	write	a	 que 	 ry 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	is	dr.	smith	's	address	?	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	small	system	 actual 	 ly 	 	 print 	 s 	 	it	out	--	so	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 act 	 s 	 	like	a	paper	 in 	 put 	 	-	 out 	 put 	 	system	,	just	made	out	of	paper	.
in	 an 	 other 	 	exploration	,	i	thought	of	making	a	pen	that	can	draw	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	 implement 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	pen	that	can	help	 design 	 ers 	 	and	 architect 	 s 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	think	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	but	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	draw	so	that	it	's	more	intuitive	to	use	that	way	.
then	i	thought	,	``	why	not	make	a	google	map	,	but	in	the	physical	world	?	``
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 ty 	 ping 	 	a	 key 	 word 	 	to	find	 some 	 thing 	 	,	i	put	my	 object 	 s 	 	on	top	of	it	.
if	i	put	a	 board 	 ing 	 	pass	,	it	will	show	me	where	the	flight	gate	is	.
a	coffee	cup	will	show	where	you	can	find	more	coffee	,	or	where	you	can	trash	the	cup	.
so	,	these	 we 	 re 	 	some	of	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	 exploration 	 s 	 	i	did	 be 	 cause 	 	the	goal	was	to	connect	these	two	 world 	 s 	 	 seam 	 lessly 	 	.
among	all	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	there	was	one	thing	in	common	:	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	part	of	the	physical	world	to	the	digital	world	.
i	was	taking	some	part	of	the	 object 	 s 	 	,	or	any	of	the	 intuitive 	 ness 	 	of	real	life	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	to	the	digital	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	goal	was	to	make	our	computing	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	more	intuitive	.
but	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	 human 	 s 	 	are	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	computing	.
what	we	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	information	.
we	want	to	know	about	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	want	to	know	about	dynamic	 thing 	 s 	 	going	around	.
so	i	thought	,	around	last	year	--	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	last	year	--	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	can	i	not	take	 th 	 is 	 	approach	in	the	reverse	way	?	``
 may 	 be 	 	,	``	how	about	i	take	my	digital	world	and	paint	the	physical	world	with	that	digital	information	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	 pixel 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	right	now	,	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	in	these	 rect 	 angular 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	fit	in	our	 pocket 	 s 	 	.
why	can	i	not	 re 	 move 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 fine 	 	and	take	that	to	my	 every 	 day 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 day 	 	life	so	that	i	do	n't	need	to	learn	the	new	language	for	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 pixel 	 s 	 	?
so	,	in	order	to	 real 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	dream	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	thought	of	 put 	 ting 	 	a	big	-	 s 	 ize 	 	 project 	 or 	 	on	my	head	.
i	think	that	's	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	head	-	 mount 	 ed 	 	 project 	 or 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
i	took	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	and	took	my	bike	helmet	,	put	a	little	cut	over	there	so	that	the	 project 	 or 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
so	now	,	what	i	can	do	--	i	can	augment	the	world	around	me	with	 th 	 is 	 	digital	information	.
but	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	interact	with	 t 	 hose 	 	digital	 pixel 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	.
so	i	put	a	small	camera	over	there	,	that	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	digital	eye	.
 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	 move 	 d 	 	to	a	much	better	,	consumer	-	oriented	 pend 	 ant 	 	version	of	that	,	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	now	know	 a 	 s 	 	the	sixthsense	 de 	 vice 	 	.
but	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	technology	is	that	you	can	carry	your	digital	world	with	you	 where 	 ver 	 	you	go	.
you	can	start	using	any	surface	,	any	wall	around	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 inter 	 face 	 	.
the	camera	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	all	your	 gest 	 ures 	 	.
 what 	 ever 	 	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	your	 hand 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	 gest 	 ure 	 	.
and	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	see	,	there	are	some	color	 marker 	 s 	 	that	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	version	we	are	using	with	it	.
you	can	start	 paint 	 ing 	 	on	any	wall	.
you	stop	by	a	wall	,	and	start	 paint 	 ing 	 	on	that	wall	.
but	we	are	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	one	finger	,	here	.
we	are	giving	you	the	 free 	 dom 	 	of	using	all	of	both	of	your	 hand 	 s 	 	,	so	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	both	of	your	 hand 	 s 	 	to	zoom	 in 	 to 	 	or	zoom	out	of	a	map	just	by	 pinch 	 ing 	 	all	present	.
the	camera	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	--	just	,	 get 	 ting 	 	all	the	 image 	 s 	 	--	is	 do 	 ing 	 	the	edge	 re 	 cognition 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	color	 re 	 cognition 	 	and	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	small	 algorithm 	 s 	 	are	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	.
so	,	 technical 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	little	bit	complex	,	but	it	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	 out 	 put 	 	which	is	more	intuitive	to	use	,	in	some	sense	.
but	i	'm	more	 excit 	 ed 	 	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	it	 out 	 side 	 	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 get 	 ting 	 	your	camera	out	of	your	pocket	,	you	can	just	do	the	 gest 	 ure 	 	of	taking	a	photo	and	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	photo	for	you	.
thank	you	.
and	 lat 	 er 	 	i	can	find	a	wall	,	 any 	 where 	 	,	and	start	 brow 	 s 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	or	 may 	 be 	 	,	``	ok	,	i	want	to	modify	 th 	 is 	 	photo	a	little	bit	and	 s 	 end 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	email	to	a	friend	.	``
so	,	we	are	looking	for	an	era	where	computing	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	merge	with	the	physical	world	.
and	,	of	course	,	if	you	do	n't	have	any	surface	,	you	can	start	using	your	palm	for	simple	 operation 	 s 	 	.
here	,	i	'm	 dial 	 ing 	 	a	phone	number	just	using	my	hand	.
the	camera	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	your	hand	 move 	 ments 	 	,	but	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	is	 al 	 so 	 	able	to	understand	what	 object 	 s 	 	you	are	 hold 	 ing 	 	in	your	hand	.
what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	here	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	book	cover	is	 match 	 ed 	 	with	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	 check 	 ing 	 	out	which	book	it	is	.
once	it	 ha 	 s 	 	that	information	,	it	 find 	 s 	 	out	more	 review 	 s 	 	about	that	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	sound	 over 	 view 	 	on	that	,	so	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hear	,	on	a	physical	book	,	a	review	 a 	 s 	 	sound	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	obama	's	visit	last	week	to	mit	.
so	,	i	was	 see 	 ing 	 	the	live	[	video	]	of	his	talk	,	 out 	 side 	 	,	on	just	a	 news 	 paper 	 	.
your	 news 	 paper 	 	will	show	you	live	weather	information	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	it	 update 	 d 	 	--	like	,	you	have	to	check	your	computer	in	order	to	do	that	,	right	?
when	i	'm	going	back	,	i	can	just	use	my	 board 	 ing 	 	pass	to	check	how	much	my	flight	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 delay 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	at	that	 part 	 icular 	 	time	,	i	'm	not	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	 open 	 ing 	 	my	iphone	,	and	 check 	 ing 	 	out	a	 part 	 icular 	 	icon	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	technology	will	not	 on 	 ly 	 	change	the	way	--	 y 	 es 	 	.
it	will	change	the	way	we	interact	with	people	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	physical	world	.
the	 f 	 un 	 	part	is	,	i	'm	going	to	the	boston	metro	,	and	 play 	 ing 	 	a	pong	game	 in 	 side 	 	the	train	on	the	ground	,	right	?
and	i	think	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	limit	of	what	you	can	think	of	when	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	technology	 merge 	 s 	 	with	real	life	.
but	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 argu 	 e 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	all	of	our	work	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	about	physical	 object 	 s 	 	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 account 	 ing 	 	and	paper	 edit 	 ing 	 	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	;	what	about	that	?
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	are	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	the	next	generation	 table 	 t 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	to	come	out	in	the	market	.
so	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	that	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	my	own	,	just	using	a	piece	of	paper	.
so	,	what	i	did	here	is	 re 	 move 	 	the	camera	--	all	the	 web 	 cam 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	have	a	 micro 	 phone 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	camera	.
i	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	the	 micro 	 phone 	 	from	that	,	and	then	just	 pinch 	 ed 	 	that	--	like	i	just	made	a	clip	out	of	the	 micro 	 phone 	 	--	and	 clip 	 ped 	 	that	to	a	piece	of	paper	,	any	paper	that	you	found	around	.
so	now	the	sound	of	the	touch	is	 get 	 ting 	 	me	when	 exact 	 ly 	 	i	'm	 touch 	 ing 	 	the	paper	.
but	the	camera	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	where	my	 finger 	 s 	 	are	moving	.
you	can	of	course	watch	 movie 	 s 	 	.
and	i	am	a	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	 explore 	 r 	 	in	tribe	54.	``	)	and	you	can	of	course	play	 game 	 s 	 	.
here	,	the	camera	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	you	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	paper	and	 play 	 ing 	 	a	car	-	 rac 	 ing 	 	game	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 al 	 ready 	 	must	have	thought	,	ok	,	you	can	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.	of	course	you	can	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	to	any	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	or	you	can	do	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	computing	on	a	piece	of	paper	 where 	 ver 	 	you	need	it	.
so	,	more	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	we	can	take	that	in	a	more	dynamic	way	.
when	i	come	back	to	my	desk	i	can	just	pinch	that	information	back	to	my	 desk 	 top 	 	so	i	can	use	my	full	-	 s 	 ize 	 	computer	.
and	why	 on 	 ly 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	?	we	can	just	play	with	 paper 	 s 	 	.
paper	world	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	play	with	.
here	,	i	'm	taking	a	part	of	a	document	and	 put 	 ting 	 	over	here	a	second	part	from	a	second	place	--	and	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	 modify 	 ing 	 	the	information	that	i	have	over	there	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.	and	i	say	,	``	ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	nice	,	let	me	print	it	out	,	that	thing	.	``
so	i	now	have	a	print	-	out	of	that	thing	,	and	now	--	the	 work 	 flow 	 	is	more	intuitive	the	way	we	used	to	do	it	 may 	 be 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	back	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	now	 s 	 witch 	 ing 	 	between	these	two	 world 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	last	thought	,	i	think	that	 integ 	 rating 	 	information	to	 every 	 day 	 	 object 	 s 	 	will	not	 on 	 ly 	 	help	us	to	get	rid	of	the	digital	divide	,	the	gap	between	these	two	 world 	 s 	 	,	but	will	 al 	 so 	 	help	us	,	in	some	way	,	to	stay	human	,	to	be	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	our	physical	world	.
and	it	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	help	us	not	end	up	 be 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	other	 machine 	 s 	 	.
that	's	all	.	thank	you	.

and	now	,	if	you	see	,	it	's	more	about	the	cost	-	 effective 	 ness 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	system	 cost 	 s 	 	you	$	300	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	$	20,000	surface	 table 	 s 	 	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	even	the	$	2	mouse	 gest 	 ure 	 	system	at	that	time	was	 cost 	 ing 	 	around	$	5,000	?
so	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	i	 show 	 ed 	 	that	,	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	,	to	 p 	 resident 	 	abdul	kalam	,	at	that	time	,	and	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ok	,	we	should	use	 th 	 is 	 	in	bhabha	atomic	research	centre	for	some	use	of	that	.	``
so	i	'm	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	how	i	can	 br 	 ing 	 	the	technology	to	the	 masse 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	 keep 	 ing 	 	that	technology	in	the	lab	environment	.
ca	:	based	on	the	people	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	at	ted	,	i	would	say	you	're	 tru 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	two	or	three	best	 inventor 	 s 	 	in	the	world	right	now	.
it	's	an	honor	to	have	you	at	ted	.
thank	you	so	much	.
