 an 	 other 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	designed	new	building	 ruin 	 ed 	 	by	the	sound	of	a	common	wall	light	 s 	 witch 	 	.
it	's	fine	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	when	the	main	rooms	are	 flood 	 ed 	 	with	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	.
but	at	 du 	 s 	 k 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.

and	then	left	it	to	a	 contract 	 or 	 	to	install	these	79	-	cent	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	them	.
we	know	 instinct 	 ively 	 	where	to	reach	when	we	enter	a	dark	room	.
we	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	throw	the	little	nub	of	plastic	 up 	 ward 	 	.
but	the	sound	we	are	 greet 	 ed 	 	with	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	room	is	 bath 	 ed 	 	in	the	 simul 	 ated 	 	glow	of	late	-	afternoon	light	,	 recall 	 s 	 	to	mind	a	 dirt 	 y 	 	men	's	room	in	the	rear	of	a	greek	coffee	shop	.
 th 	 is 	 	sound	 color 	 s 	 	our	first	impression	of	any	room	;	it	ca	n't	be	 help 	 ed 	 	.
but	where	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sound	,	 common 	 ly 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	click	,	come	from	?
is	it	 simpl 	 y 	 	the	 by 	 product 	 	of	a	 crud 	 e 	 	 mechanic 	 al 	 	action	?

the	often	 dent 	 al 	 	 con 	 son 	 ant 	 	of	no	indo	-	european	language	.
or	is	it	the	 ampl 	 ified 	 	sound	of	a	synapse	 fir 	 ing 	 	in	the	brain	of	a	 cock 	 roach 	 	?
in	the	1950s	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	best	to	muffle	 th 	 is 	 	sound	with	 merc 	 ury 	 	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	and	silent	knob	 control 	 s 	 	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	these	 improve 	 ments 	 	seem	 some 	 how 	 	 in 	 authentic 	 	.
