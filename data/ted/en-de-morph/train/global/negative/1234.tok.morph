so	i	'm	a	doctor	,	but	i	kind	of	 s 	 lipped 	 	 side 	 ways 	 	 in 	 to 	 	research	,	and	now	i	'm	an	 epidemio 	 logist 	 	.
and	 no 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 know 	 s 	 	what	 epidemio 	 logy 	 	is	.
 epidemio 	 logy 	 	is	the	science	of	how	we	know	in	the	real	world	if	 some 	 thing 	 	is	good	for	you	or	bad	for	you	.
and	it	's	best	 under 	 stood 	 	through	 ex 	 ample 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	science	of	 t 	 hose 	 	crazy	,	 wack 	 y 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	 head 	 lines 	 	.
and	these	are	just	some	of	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
these	are	from	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	mail	.	every	country	in	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 news 	 paper 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	bizarre	,	 on 	 going 	 	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	project	of	 divid 	 ing 	 	all	the	 in 	 animate 	 	 object 	 s 	 	in	the	world	 in 	 to 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	either	cause	or	prevent	cancer	.
so	here	are	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	 s 	 aid 	 	cause	cancer	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	:	divorce	,	wi	-	fi	,	 toilet 	 ries 	 	and	coffee	.
here	are	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	say	 prevent 	 s 	 	cancer	:	 crust 	 s 	 	,	red	pepper	,	licorice	and	coffee	.
so	 al 	 ready 	 	you	can	see	there	are	 contradict 	 ions 	 	.
coffee	both	 cause 	 s 	 	and	 prevent 	 s 	 	cancer	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	start	to	read	on	,	you	can	see	that	 may 	 be 	 	there	's	some	kind	of	 politic 	 al 	 	valence	 be 	 hind 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	for	women	,	 house 	 work 	 	 prevent 	 s 	 	breast	cancer	,	but	for	men	,	 shop 	 ping 	 	could	make	you	 im 	 potent 	 	.
so	we	know	that	we	need	to	start	 un 	 pick 	 ing 	 	the	science	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	what	i	hope	to	show	is	that	 un 	 pick 	 ing 	 	dodgy	 claim 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 pick 	 ing 	 	the	evidence	 be 	 hind 	 	dodgy	 claim 	 s 	 	,	is	n't	a	kind	of	nasty	 carp 	 ing 	 	activity	;	it	's	 social 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	 explan 	 atory 	 	tool	.
 be 	 cause 	 	real	science	is	all	about	 critical 	 ly 	 	 app 	 raising 	 	the	evidence	for	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	position	.
that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	academic	 journal 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	at	academic	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	.
the	q	&	a	session	after	a	post	-	op	 present 	 s 	 	data	is	often	a	blood	bath	.
and	 no 	 body 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	that	.	we	 active 	 ly 	 	welcome	it	.
it	's	like	a	 consent 	 ing 	 	intellectual	s	&	m	activity	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	is	all	of	the	main	 thing 	 s 	 	,	all	of	the	main	 feature 	 s 	 	of	my	discipline	--	evidence	-	based	medicine	.
and	i	will	talk	you	through	all	of	these	and	 demonst 	 rate 	 	how	they	work	,	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	using	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	people	 get 	 ting 	 	stuff	wrong	.
so	we	'll	start	with	the	absolute	 weak 	 est 	 	form	of	evidence	known	to	man	,	and	that	is	 author 	 ity 	 	.
in	science	,	we	do	n't	care	how	 man 	 y 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	you	have	after	your	name	.
in	science	,	we	want	to	know	what	your	 reason 	 s 	 	are	for	 believ 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
how	do	you	know	that	 some 	 thing 	 	is	good	for	us	or	bad	for	us	?
but	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 un 	 impress 	 ed 	 	by	 author 	 ity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	easy	to	 contr 	 ive 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 body 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	dr.	gillian	mckeith	ph	.	d	,	or	,	to	give	her	full	medical	title	,	gillian	mckeith	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	every	country	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
she	is	our	tv	diet	guru	.
she	 ha 	 s 	 	massive	five	 s 	 eries 	 	of	prime	-	time	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	giving	out	 ver 	 y 	 	lavish	and	 ex 	 otic 	 	health	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
she	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	non	-	accredited	 correspond 	 ence 	 	course	ph.d	.
from	 some 	 where 	 	in	america	.
she	 al 	 so 	 	 boast 	 s 	 	that	she	's	a	 cert 	 ified 	 	professional	member	of	the	american	 associ 	 ation 	 	of	 nutrition 	 al 	 	 consult 	 ants 	 	,	which	 sound 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
you	get	a	certificate	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	 belong 	 s 	 	to	my	dead	cat	hetti	.	she	was	a	 horr 	 ible 	 	cat	.
you	just	go	to	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	fill	out	the	form	,	give	them	$	60	,	and	it	 arriv 	 es 	 	in	the	post	.
now	that	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	reason	that	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	person	is	an	idiot	.
she	 al 	 so 	 	 go 	 es 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	you	should	eat	 lot 	 s 	 	of	dark	green	 leav 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	contain	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 chloro 	 phyl 	 l 	 	,	and	that	will	 re 	 ally 	 	 oxygen 	 ate 	 	your	blood	.
and	 any 	 body 	 	who	's	 d 	 one 	 	school	biology	 remember 	 s 	 	that	 chloro 	 phyl 	 l 	 	and	 chlorop 	 last 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	make	oxygen	in	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	and	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	dark	in	your	 bowel 	 s 	 	after	you	've	eaten	 spin 	 ach 	 	.
next	,	we	need	proper	science	,	proper	evidence	.
so	,	``	red	wine	can	help	prevent	breast	cancer	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 head 	 line 	 	from	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	 tele 	 graph 	 	in	the	u.k	.
``	a	glass	of	red	wine	a	day	could	help	prevent	breast	cancer	.	``
so	you	go	and	find	 th 	 is 	 	paper	,	and	what	you	find	is	it	is	a	real	piece	of	science	.
it	is	a	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	 change 	 s 	 	in	one	enzyme	when	you	drip	a	chemical	 extra 	 cted 	 	from	some	red	grape	skin	onto	some	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	in	a	dish	on	a	bench	in	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	 some 	 where 	 	.
and	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	thing	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	in	a	scientific	paper	,	but	on	the	question	of	your	own	personal	risk	of	 get 	 ting 	 	breast	cancer	if	you	drink	red	wine	,	it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	 absolute 	 ly 	 	bugger	all	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	your	risk	of	breast	cancer	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	with	every	amount	of	alcohol	that	you	drink	.
so	what	we	want	is	 stud 	 ies 	 	in	real	human	people	.
and	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	britain	's	 lead 	 ing 	 	diet	and	 nutrition 	 ist 	 	in	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	mirror	,	which	is	our	second	 big 	 gest 	 	selling	 news 	 paper 	 	.
``	an	australian	 stud 	 y 	 	in	2001	found	that	 o 	 live 	 	oil	in	combination	with	 fruit 	 s 	 	,	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	and	 puls 	 es 	 	 off 	 ers 	 	 measur 	 able 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	against	skin	 wrinkl 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	``
and	then	they	give	you	 ad 	 vice 	 	:	``	if	you	eat	 o 	 live 	 	oil	and	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	have	 few 	 er 	 	skin	 wrinkl 	 es 	 	.	``
and	they	 ver 	 y 	 	 help 	 fully 	 	tell	you	how	to	go	and	find	the	paper	.
so	you	go	and	find	the	paper	,	and	what	you	find	is	an	 observ 	 ation 	 al 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	go	back	to	1930	,	get	all	the	people	born	in	one	 mat 	 ern 	 ity 	 	unit	,	and	half	of	them	eat	 lot 	 s 	 	of	fruit	and	 ve 	 g 	 	and	 o 	 live 	 	oil	,	and	then	half	of	them	eat	mcdonald	's	,	and	then	we	see	how	 man 	 y 	 	 wrinkl 	 es 	 	you	've	got	 lat 	 er 	 	.
you	have	to	take	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	of	how	people	are	now	.
and	what	you	find	is	,	of	course	,	people	who	eat	 ve 	 g 	 	and	 o 	 live 	 	oil	have	 few 	 er 	 	skin	 wrinkl 	 es 	 	.
but	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	people	who	eat	fruit	and	 ve 	 g 	 	and	 o 	 live 	 	oil	,	they	're	 freak 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	normal	,	they	're	like	you	;	they	come	to	 event 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	are	 p 	 osh 	 	,	they	're	 wealth 	 y 	 	,	they	're	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	 out 	 door 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	they	're	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	do	manual	labor	,	they	have	better	social	support	,	they	're	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	smoke	--	so	for	a	whole	host	of	 fasci 	 nating 	 	,	 inter 	 lock 	 ing 	 	social	,	 politic 	 al 	 	and	cultural	 reason 	 s 	 	,	they	are	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	skin	 wrinkl 	 es 	 	.
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	it	's	the	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	or	the	 o 	 live 	 	oil	.
so	 ideal 	 ly 	 	what	you	want	to	do	is	a	trial	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	the	idea	of	a	trial	.
 trial 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	old	.	the	first	trial	was	in	the	 b 	 ible 	 	--	daniel	1:12	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	--	you	take	a	bunch	of	people	,	you	split	them	in	half	,	you	treat	one	group	one	way	,	you	treat	the	other	group	the	other	way	,	and	a	little	while	 lat 	 er 	 	,	you	follow	them	up	and	see	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	each	of	them	.
so	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	one	trial	,	which	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	well	-	 report 	 ed 	 	trial	in	the	u.k.	news	media	over	the	past	decade	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	trial	of	fish	oil	 pill 	 s 	 	.
and	the	claim	was	fish	oil	 pill 	 s 	 	improve	school	performance	and	behavior	in	 main 	 stream 	 	children	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	trial	.
all	the	previous	 trial 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	positive	,	and	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	gon	na	be	too	.	``
that	should	 al 	 ways 	 	ring	alarm	 bell 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	the	answer	to	your	trial	,	you	should	n't	be	 do 	 ing 	 	one	.
either	you	've	 rig 	 ged 	 	it	by	design	,	or	you	've	got	 en 	 ough 	 	data	so	there	's	no	need	to	 random 	 ize 	 	people	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	do	in	 the 	 ir 	 	trial	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	taking	3,000	children	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	give	them	all	these	huge	fish	oil	 pill 	 s 	 	,	six	of	them	a	day	,	and	then	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	measure	 the 	 ir 	 	school	 ex 	 am 	 	performance	and	 compar 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	school	 ex 	 am 	 	performance	against	what	they	 predict 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 ex 	 am 	 	performance	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	if	they	had	n't	had	the	 pill 	 s 	 	.
now	can	 any 	 body 	 	spot	a	flaw	in	 th 	 is 	 	design	?
and	no	 professor 	 s 	 	of	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	 method 	 ology 	 	are	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	answer	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
so	there	's	no	control	;	there	's	no	control	group	.
but	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 tech 	 ie 	 	.
that	's	a	technical	term	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	got	the	 pill 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 the 	 ir 	 	performance	 improv 	 ed 	 	.
what	else	could	it	possibly	be	if	it	was	n't	the	 pill 	 s 	 	?
they	got	 old 	 er 	 	.	we	all	develop	over	time	.
and	of	course	,	 al 	 so 	 	there	's	the	 place 	 bo 	 	effect	.
the	 place 	 bo 	 	effect	is	one	of	the	most	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	whole	of	medicine	.
it	's	not	just	about	taking	a	pill	,	and	your	performance	and	your	pain	 get 	 ting 	 	better	.
it	's	about	our	 belief 	 s 	 	and	 expect 	 ations 	 	.
it	's	about	the	cultural	meaning	of	a	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 demonst 	 rated 	 	in	a	whole	raft	of	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	 compar 	 ing 	 	one	kind	of	 place 	 bo 	 	against	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	we	know	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	that	two	sugar	 pill 	 s 	 	a	day	are	a	more	effective	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	 gas 	 tric 	 	 ulcer 	 s 	 	than	one	sugar	pill	.
two	sugar	 pill 	 s 	 	a	day	 beat 	 s 	 	one	sugar	pill	a	day	.
and	that	's	an	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	and	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	true	.
we	know	from	three	different	 stud 	 ies 	 	on	three	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	pain	that	a	 salt 	 water 	 	 inject 	 ion 	 	is	a	more	effective	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	pain	than	taking	a	sugar	pill	,	taking	a	 d 	 um 	 my 	 	pill	that	 ha 	 s 	 	no	medicine	in	it	--	not	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 inject 	 ion 	 	or	the	 pill 	 s 	 	do	 any 	 thing 	 	 physical 	 ly 	 	to	the	body	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	an	 inject 	 ion 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	like	a	much	more	 dramat 	 ic 	 	intervention	.
so	we	know	that	our	 belief 	 s 	 	and	 expect 	 ations 	 	can	be	 manipul 	 ated 	 	,	which	is	why	we	do	 trial 	 s 	 	where	we	control	against	a	 place 	 bo 	 	--	where	one	half	of	the	people	get	the	real	 treat 	 ment 	 	and	the	other	half	get	 place 	 bo 	 	.
but	that	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
what	i	've	just	 show 	 n 	 	you	are	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	and	 straight 	 forward 	 	ways	that	 journalist 	 s 	 	and	food	supplement	pill	 peddl 	 ers 	 	and	 naturo 	 path 	 s 	 	can	distort	evidence	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 purpose 	 s 	 	.
what	i	find	 re 	 ally 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	is	that	the	pharmaceutical	industry	uses	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 trick 	 s 	 	and	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	but	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 version 	 s 	 	of	them	,	in	order	to	distort	the	evidence	that	they	give	to	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 patient 	 s 	 	,	and	which	we	use	to	make	 vital 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	.
so	 first 	 ly 	 	,	 trial 	 s 	 	against	 place 	 bo 	 	:	 every 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	they	know	that	a	trial	should	be	a	 compar 	 ison 	 	of	your	new	drug	against	 place 	 bo 	 	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	a	lot	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	that	's	wrong	.
 be 	 cause 	 	often	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 treat 	 ment 	 	that	is	 current 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	so	we	do	n't	want	to	know	that	your	 alter 	 native 	 	new	 treat 	 ment 	 	is	better	than	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
we	want	to	know	that	it	's	better	than	the	best	 current 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	that	we	have	.
and	yet	,	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	,	you	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	see	people	 do 	 ing 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	still	against	 place 	 bo 	 	.
and	you	can	get	 licens 	 e 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	your	drug	to	market	with	 on 	 ly 	 	data	 show 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	better	than	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 use 	 less 	 	for	a	doctor	like	me	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	decision	.
but	that	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	you	can	rig	your	data	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	rig	your	data	by	making	the	thing	you	 compar 	 e 	 	your	new	drug	against	 re 	 ally 	 	 rub 	 b 	 ish 	 	.
you	can	give	the	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	drug	in	too	low	a	dose	,	so	that	people	are	n't	 proper 	 ly 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	.
you	can	give	the	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	drug	in	too	high	a	dose	,	so	that	people	get	side	 effect 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	which	 anti 	 psycho 	 tic 	 	 medic 	 ation 	 	for	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	.
20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	new	generation	of	 anti 	 psycho 	 tic 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	in	and	the	promise	was	that	they	would	have	 few 	 er 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	.
so	people	set	about	 do 	 ing 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	of	these	new	 drug 	 s 	 	against	the	old	 drug 	 s 	 	,	but	they	 g 	 ave 	 	the	old	 drug 	 s 	 	in	 ridicul 	 ously 	 	high	 dose 	 s 	 	--	20	 milli 	 gram 	 s 	 	a	day	of	 halo 	 per 	 idol 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 fore 	 gone 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	if	you	give	a	drug	at	that	high	a	dose	,	that	it	will	have	more	side	 effect 	 s 	 	and	that	your	new	drug	will	look	better	.
10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 histo 	 ry 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	when	 risperid 	 one 	 	,	which	was	the	first	of	the	new	-	generation	 anti 	 pscyh 	 otic 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	,	came	off	 copy 	 right 	 	,	so	 any 	 body 	 	could	make	copies	.
 every 	 body 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	that	 the 	 ir 	 	drug	was	better	than	 risperid 	 one 	 	,	so	you	see	a	bunch	of	 trial 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ing 	 	new	 anti 	 psycho 	 tic 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	against	 risperid 	 one 	 	at	eight	 milli 	 gram 	 s 	 	a	day	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	not	an	 insan 	 e 	 	dose	,	not	an	 il 	 legal 	 	dose	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	much	at	the	high	end	of	normal	.
and	so	you	're	bound	to	make	your	new	drug	look	better	.
and	so	it	's	no	surprise	that	 over 	 all 	 	,	are	four	 time 	 s 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	give	a	positive	result	than	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	 sponsor 	 ed 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	.
but	--	and	it	's	a	big	but	--	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	when	you	look	at	the	 method 	 s 	 	used	by	industry	-	funded	 trial 	 s 	 	,	that	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	better	than	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	 sponsor 	 ed 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	they	 al 	 ways 	 	manage	to	to	get	the	result	that	they	want	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	?
how	can	we	explain	 th 	 is 	 	strange	 phenomen 	 on 	 	?
well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	the	negative	data	 go 	 es 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	in	action	;	it	's	 with 	 held 	 	from	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 patient 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	whole	story	.
it	's	at	the	top	of	the	pyramid	of	evidence	.
we	need	to	have	all	of	the	data	on	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	to	know	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	effective	.
and	there	are	two	different	ways	that	you	can	spot	 whet 	 her 	 	some	data	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	in	action	.
you	can	use	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	or	you	can	use	 st 	 ories 	 	.
i	 personal 	 ly 	 	prefer	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	so	that	's	what	i	'm	going	to	do	first	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	funnel	plot	.
and	a	funnel	plot	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	way	of	 spot 	 ting 	 	if	small	negative	 trial 	 s 	 	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	have	gone	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	in	action	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	of	all	of	the	 trial 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	on	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	up	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	top	of	the	graph	,	what	you	see	is	each	dot	is	a	trial	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	up	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 big 	 ger 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	so	they	've	got	less	error	in	them	.
so	they	're	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 random 	 ly 	 	false	 positive 	 s 	 	,	 random 	 ly 	 	false	 negative 	 s 	 	.
so	they	all	cluster	together	.
the	big	 trial 	 s 	 	are	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	true	answer	.
then	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	further	down	at	the	bottom	,	what	you	can	see	is	,	over	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	the	 s 	 pur 	 ious 	 	false	 negative 	 s 	 	,	and	over	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	the	 s 	 pur 	 ious 	 	false	 positive 	 s 	 	.
if	there	is	 public 	 ation 	 	bias	,	if	small	negative	 trial 	 s 	 	have	gone	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	in	action	,	you	can	see	it	on	one	of	these	 graph 	 s 	 	.
so	you	can	see	here	that	the	small	negative	 trial 	 s 	 	that	should	be	on	the	bottom	left	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	 demonst 	 rating 	 	the	presence	of	 public 	 ation 	 	bias	in	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 public 	 ation 	 	bias	.
and	i	think	that	's	the	 funni 	 est 	 	 epidemio 	 logy 	 	joke	that	you	will	ever	hear	.
that	's	how	you	can	prove	it	 statistic 	 ally 	 	,	but	what	about	 st 	 ories 	 	?
well	they	're	 he 	 in 	 ous 	 	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	 reboxet 	 ine 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	drug	that	i	 my 	 self 	 	have	 pre 	 scribed 	 	to	 patient 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 nerd 	 y 	 	doctor	.
i	hope	i	try	to	go	out	of	my	way	to	try	and	read	and	understand	all	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
i	read	the	 trial 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	positive	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	well	-	 conduct 	 ed 	 	.
i	found	no	flaw	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 trial 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 with 	 held 	 	.
in	fact	,	76	percent	of	all	of	the	 trial 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 d 	 one 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	drug	 we 	 re 	 	 with 	 held 	 	from	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 patient 	 s 	 	.
now	if	you	think	about	it	,	if	i	 to 	 s 	 s 	 ed 	 	a	 co 	 in 	 	a	hundred	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	 with 	 hold 	 	from	you	the	 answer 	 s 	 	half	the	 time 	 s 	 	,	then	i	can	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	i	have	a	 co 	 in 	 	with	two	 head 	 s 	 	.
if	we	 re 	 move 	 	half	of	the	data	,	we	can	never	know	what	the	true	effect	 s 	 ize 	 	of	these	 medicine 	 s 	 	is	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	 isolate 	 d 	 	story	.
around	half	of	all	of	the	trial	data	on	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 with 	 held 	 	,	but	it	 go 	 es 	 	way	beyond	that	.
the	nordic	cochrane	group	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	hold	of	the	data	on	that	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	all	together	.
the	cochrane	 group 	 s 	 	are	an	 inter 	 national 	 	 non 	 profit 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	that	produce	 system 	 atic 	 	 review 	 s 	 	of	all	of	the	data	that	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	.
and	they	need	to	have	access	to	all	of	the	trial	data	.
but	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 with 	 held 	 	that	data	from	them	,	and	so	did	the	european	 medicine 	 s 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	that	is	 current 	 ly 	 	 lack 	 ing 	 	a	solution	.
and	to	show	how	big	it	 go 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	tamiflu	,	which	 government 	 s 	 	around	the	world	have	 s 	 pent 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	.
and	they	 s 	 pend 	 	that	money	on	the	promise	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	drug	which	will	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	rate	of	 complic 	 ations 	 	with	flu	.
we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	the	data	 show 	 ing 	 	that	it	 reduc 	 es 	 	the	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	your	flu	by	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	.
but	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	that	.	 government 	 s 	 	do	n't	care	about	that	.
i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	sorry	if	you	have	the	flu	,	i	know	it	's	 horr 	 ible 	 	,	but	we	're	not	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	your	flu	 symptom 	 s 	 	by	half	a	day	.
we	 pre 	 scribe 	 	these	 drug 	 s 	 	,	we	 stock 	 pile 	 	them	for	 emerge 	 ncies 	 	on	the	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	they	will	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	number	of	 complic 	 ations 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	and	which	 mean 	 s 	 	death	.
the	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	cochrane	group	,	which	are	based	in	italy	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	full	data	in	a	 us 	 able 	 	form	out	of	the	drug	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	so	that	they	can	make	a	full	decision	about	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	drug	is	effective	or	not	,	and	they	've	not	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	that	information	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 un 	 doubt 	 ed 	 ly 	 	the	single	 big 	 gest 	 	 ethic 	 al 	 	problem	facing	medicine	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	can	not	make	 decision 	 s 	 	in	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	all	of	the	information	.
so	it	's	a	little	bit	difficult	from	there	to	spin	in	some	kind	of	positive	 con 	 clusion 	 	.
but	i	would	say	 th 	 is 	 	:	i	think	that	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	is	the	best	 dis 	 infect 	 ant 	 	.
all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	plain	sight	,	and	they	're	all	 protect 	 ed 	 	by	a	force	field	of	 ted 	 ious 	 ness 	 	.
and	i	think	,	with	all	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	in	science	,	one	of	the	best	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	is	to	lift	up	the	 li 	 d 	 	,	finger	around	in	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	and	peer	in	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
