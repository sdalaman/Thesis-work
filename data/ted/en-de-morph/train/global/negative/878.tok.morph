one	thing	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	,	one	thing	 th 	 is 	 	country	 desperate 	 ly 	 	 need 	 s 	 	is	a	better	way	of	 conduct 	 ing 	 	our	 politic 	 al 	 	 debate 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	 re 	 discover 	 	the	lost	art	of	 democrat 	 ic 	 	argument	.
if	you	think	about	the	 argument 	 s 	 	we	have	,	most	of	the	time	it	's	 shout 	 ing 	 	 match 	 es 	 	on	cable	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	 ideo 	 logical 	 	food	 fight 	 s 	 	on	the	floor	of	congress	.
i	have	a	 suggest 	 ion 	 	.
look	at	all	the	 argument 	 s 	 	we	have	these	 day 	 s 	 	over	health	care	,	over	 bon 	 uses 	 	and	 bail 	 out 	 s 	 	on	wall	street	,	over	the	gap	between	rich	and	poor	,	over	 affirm 	 ative 	 	action	and	same	-	 s 	 ex 	 	marriage	.
 ly 	 ing 	 	just	 be 	 neath 	 	the	surface	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 argument 	 s 	 	,	with	 pass 	 ions 	 	 rag 	 ing 	 	on	all	 side 	 s 	 	,	are	big	 question 	 s 	 	of	moral	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	big	 question 	 s 	 	of	justice	.
but	we	too	 rare 	 ly 	 	articulate	and	defend	and	 argu 	 e 	 	about	 t 	 hose 	 	big	moral	 question 	 s 	 	in	our	 politic 	 s 	 	.
so	what	i	would	like	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	have	 some 	 thing 	 	of	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
first	,	let	me	take	a	famous	 philosoph 	 er 	 	who	wrote	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	of	justice	and	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	give	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	 lectur 	 e 	 	on	aristotle	of	ancient	athens	,	aristotle	's	 theor 	 y 	 	of	justice	,	and	then	have	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	here	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	aristotle	's	 idea 	 s 	 	the	way	we	think	and	 argu 	 e 	 	about	 question 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	are	you	ready	for	the	 lectur 	 e 	 	?
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	aristotle	,	justice	 mean 	 s 	 	giving	people	what	they	deserve	.
that	's	it	;	that	's	the	 lectur 	 e 	 	.
now	,	you	may	say	,	well	,	that	's	obvious	 en 	 ough 	 	.
the	real	 question 	 s 	 	begin	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 argu 	 ing 	 	about	who	 deserve 	 s 	 	what	and	why	.
take	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 flut 	 es 	 	.
suppose	we	're	 distribut 	 ing 	 	 flut 	 es 	 	.
who	should	get	the	best	 one 	 s 	 	?
let	's	see	what	people	--	what	would	you	say	?
who	should	get	the	best	 flut 	 e 	 	?
you	can	just	call	it	out	.
michael	sandel	:	at	random	.	you	would	do	it	by	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	.
or	by	the	first	person	to	rush	 in 	 to 	 	the	hall	to	get	them	.
who	else	?
ms	:	the	best	 flut 	 e 	 	 player 	 s 	 	.
ms	:	the	worst	 flut 	 e 	 	 player 	 s 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	say	the	best	 flut 	 e 	 	 player 	 s 	 	?
why	?
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	was	aristotle	's	answer	too	.
but	here	's	a	 hard 	 er 	 	question	.
why	do	you	think	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	 vot 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	that	the	best	 flut 	 es 	 	should	go	to	the	best	 flut 	 e 	 	 player 	 s 	 	?
peter	:	the	 great 	 est 	 	benefit	to	all	.
ms	:	the	 great 	 est 	 	benefit	to	all	.
we	'll	hear	better	music	if	the	best	 flut 	 es 	 	should	go	to	the	best	 flut 	 e 	 	 player 	 s 	 	.
that	's	peter	?
ms	:	all	right	.
well	,	it	's	a	good	reason	.
we	'll	all	be	better	off	if	good	music	is	 play 	 ed 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 terr 	 ible 	 	music	.
but	peter	,	aristotle	 do 	 es 	 	n't	agree	with	you	that	that	's	the	reason	.
that	's	all	right	.
aristotle	had	a	different	reason	for	 say 	 ing 	 	the	best	 flut 	 es 	 	should	go	to	the	best	 flut 	 e 	 	 player 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	that	's	what	 flut 	 es 	 	are	for	--	to	be	 play 	 ed 	 	well	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	that	to	reason	about	just	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	a	thing	,	we	have	to	reason	about	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 argu 	 e 	 	about	,	the	purpose	of	the	thing	,	or	the	social	activity	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	musical	performance	.
and	the	point	,	the	essential	nature	,	of	musical	performance	is	to	produce	 excel 	 lent 	 	music	.
it	'll	be	a	happy	 by 	 product 	 	that	we	'll	all	benefit	.
but	when	we	think	about	justice	,	aristotle	 say 	 s 	 	,	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	think	about	is	the	essential	nature	of	the	activity	in	question	and	the	 qual 	 ities 	 	that	are	worth	 honor 	 ing 	 	and	 admi 	 ring 	 	and	 recogn 	 izing 	 	.
one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	that	the	best	 flut 	 e 	 	 player 	 s 	 	should	get	the	best	 flut 	 es 	 	is	that	musical	performance	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	make	the	rest	of	us	happy	,	but	to	honor	and	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	excellence	of	the	best	 music 	 ians 	 	.
now	,	 flut 	 es 	 	may	seem	...	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	 flut 	 es 	 	may	seem	a	trivial	case	.
let	's	take	a	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	 disput 	 e 	 	about	justice	.
it	had	to	do	with	golf	.
casey	martin	--	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	casey	martin	--	did	any	of	you	hear	about	him	?
he	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 golf 	 er 	 	,	but	he	had	a	 dis 	 ability 	 	.
he	had	a	bad	leg	,	a	 circul 	 atory 	 	problem	,	that	made	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	for	him	to	walk	the	course	.
in	fact	,	it	carried	risk	of	 in 	 jury 	 	.
he	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	pga	,	the	professional	golfers	'	 associ 	 ation 	 	,	for	 per 	 mission 	 	to	use	a	golf	cart	in	the	pga	 tournament 	 s 	 	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	.
now	that	would	give	you	an	 un 	 fair 	 	advantage	.	``
and	his	case	went	all	the	way	to	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	the	case	over	the	golf	cart	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	law	 say 	 s 	 	that	the	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	 provide 	 d 	 	the	 accommo 	 d 	 ation 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	change	the	essential	nature	of	the	activity	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	a	great	 golf 	 er 	 	.
i	want	to	compete	.
but	i	need	a	golf	cart	to	get	from	one	hole	to	the	next	.	``
suppose	you	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	.
suppose	you	 we 	 re 	 	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	the	justice	of	 th 	 is 	 	case	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	here	would	say	that	casey	martin	 do 	 es 	 	have	a	right	to	use	a	golf	cart	?
and	how	 man 	 y 	 	say	,	no	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	?
all	right	,	let	's	take	a	poll	,	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	would	rule	in	favor	of	casey	martin	?
and	how	 man 	 y 	 	would	not	?	how	 man 	 y 	 	would	say	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	?
all	right	,	we	have	a	good	division	of	opinion	here	.
 some 	 one 	 	who	would	not	grant	casey	martin	the	right	to	a	golf	cart	,	what	would	be	your	reason	?
raise	your	hand	,	and	we	'll	try	to	get	you	a	 micro 	 phone 	 	.
what	would	be	your	reason	?
ms	:	it	would	be	an	 un 	 fair 	 	advantage	if	he	 get 	 s 	 	to	ride	in	a	golf	cart	.
all	right	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	,	i	imagine	most	of	you	who	would	not	give	him	the	golf	cart	worry	about	an	 un 	 fair 	 	advantage	.
what	about	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	say	he	should	be	 give 	 n 	 	a	golf	cart	?
how	would	you	answer	the	 object 	 ion 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	all	right	.

tell	us	,	charlie	,	why	would	you	say	he	should	be	able	to	use	a	golf	cart	?
charlie	:	the	cart	's	not	part	of	the	game	.
ms	:	but	what	about	 walk 	 ing 	 	from	hole	to	hole	?
charlie	:	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	;	it	's	not	part	of	the	game	.

charlie	:	not	in	my	book	,	it	is	n't	.
ms	:	all	right	.	stay	there	,	charlie	.
who	 ha 	 s 	 	an	answer	for	charlie	?
all	right	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	an	answer	for	charlie	?
what	would	you	say	?
audience	:	the	 endur 	 ance 	 	element	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	the	game	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	.

that	's	part	of	the	game	of	golf	?

charlie	,	what	do	you	say	to	warren	?
charley	:	i	'll	stick	to	my	original	thesis	.
ms	:	warren	,	are	you	a	 golf 	 er 	 	?
warren	:	i	am	not	a	 golf 	 er 	 	.
charley	:	and	i	am	.
you	know	,	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
in	the	case	,	in	the	lower	court	,	they	 br 	 ought 	 	in	 golf 	 ing 	 	 great 	 s 	 	to	 test 	 ify 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	issue	.
is	 walk 	 ing 	 	the	course	essential	to	the	game	?
and	they	 br 	 ought 	 	in	jack	nicklaus	and	arnold	palmer	.
and	what	do	you	suppose	they	all	 s 	 aid 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	.	they	 agree 	 d 	 	with	warren	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	the	course	is	 st 	 ren 	 uous 	 	physical	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
the	fatigue	factor	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	golf	.
and	so	it	would	change	the	fundamental	nature	of	the	game	to	give	him	the	golf	cart	.
now	,	notice	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	--	well	,	i	should	tell	you	about	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	first	.
the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	 decide 	 d 	 	.
what	do	you	suppose	they	 s 	 aid 	 	?
that	casey	martin	must	be	 provide 	 d 	 	a	golf	cart	.
seven	to	two	,	they	 rul 	 ed 	 	.
what	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 rul 	 ing 	 	and	about	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	we	've	just	had	is	that	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	about	the	right	,	the	justice	,	of	the	matter	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	what	is	the	essential	nature	of	golf	.
and	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	 justice 	 s 	 	 wrestl 	 ed 	 	with	that	question	.
and	justice	stevens	,	writing	for	the	 major 	 ity 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	he	had	read	all	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	golf	,	and	the	essential	point	of	the	game	is	to	get	 ver 	 y 	 	small	ball	from	one	place	 in 	 to 	 	a	hole	in	 a 	 s 	 	few	 stroke 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	and	that	 walk 	 ing 	 	was	not	essential	,	but	 incident 	 al 	 	.
now	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 dis 	 s 	 enter 	 s 	 	,	one	of	whom	was	justice	scalia	.
he	would	n't	have	 grant 	 ed 	 	the	cart	,	and	he	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	.
it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 reject 	 ed 	 	the	aristotelian	 pre 	 mise 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	's	opinion	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	's	not	possible	to	determine	the	essential	nature	of	a	game	like	golf	.
here	's	how	he	put	it	.
``	to	say	that	 some 	 thing 	 	is	essential	is	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	to	say	that	it	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	the	 achiev 	 ement 	 	of	a	certain	object	.
but	since	it	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	of	a	game	to	have	no	object	 ex 	 cept 	 	 amuse 	 ment 	 	,	that	is	,	what	 distinguish 	 es 	 	 game 	 s 	 	from	productive	activity	,	it	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	say	that	any	of	a	game	's	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	is	essential	.	``
so	there	you	have	justice	scalia	taking	on	the	aristotelian	 pre 	 mise 	 	of	the	 major 	 ity 	 	's	opinion	.
justice	scalia	's	opinion	is	 question 	 able 	 	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
first	,	no	real	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	fan	would	talk	that	way	.
if	we	had	thought	that	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	the	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	we	care	about	are	 mere 	 ly 	 	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	designed	to	call	forth	the	 virtue 	 s 	 	and	the	 excellence 	 s 	 	that	we	think	are	worthy	of	 admi 	 ring 	 	,	we	would	n't	care	about	the	 out 	 come 	 	of	the	game	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 object 	 ion 	 able 	 	on	a	second	ground	.
on	the	face	of	it	,	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	--	 th 	 is 	 	debate	about	the	golf	cart	--	an	argument	about	 fair 	 ness 	 	,	what	's	an	 un 	 fair 	 	advantage	.
but	if	 fair 	 ness 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	at	 s 	 take 	 	,	there	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	an	easy	and	obvious	solution	.
what	would	it	be	?
let	 every 	 one 	 	ride	in	a	golf	cart	if	they	want	to	.
then	the	 fair 	 ness 	 	 object 	 ion 	 	 go 	 es 	 	away	.
but	 lett 	 ing 	 	 every 	 one 	 	ride	in	a	cart	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	,	i	suspect	,	more	anathema	to	the	 golf 	 ing 	 	 great 	 s 	 	and	to	the	pga	,	even	than	making	an	exception	for	casey	martin	.
why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	what	was	at	 s 	 take 	 	in	the	 disput 	 e 	 	over	the	golf	cart	was	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	essential	nature	of	golf	,	but	,	 related 	 ly 	 	,	the	question	:	what	abilities	are	worthy	of	honor	and	 re 	 cognition 	 	 a 	 s 	 	athletic	 talent 	 s 	 	?
let	me	put	the	point	 a 	 s 	 	 delic 	 ate 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	:	golfers	are	a	little	sensitive	about	the	athletic	 stat 	 us 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	game	.
after	all	,	there	's	no	running	or	 jump 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	ball	 stand 	 s 	 	still	.
so	if	 golf 	 ing 	 	is	the	kind	of	game	that	can	be	 play 	 ed 	 	while	 rid 	 ing 	 	around	in	a	golf	cart	,	it	would	be	hard	to	confer	on	the	 golf 	 ing 	 	 great 	 s 	 	the	 stat 	 us 	 	that	we	confer	,	the	honor	and	 re 	 cognition 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	to	 tru 	 ly 	 	great	 athlete 	 s 	 	.
that	with	golf	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	 flut 	 es 	 	,	it	's	hard	to	decide	the	question	of	what	justice	 requir 	 es 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 grappl 	 ing 	 	with	the	question	,	``	what	is	the	essential	nature	of	the	activity	in	question	,	and	what	 qual 	 ities 	 	,	what	 excellence 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	that	activity	,	are	worthy	of	honor	and	 re 	 cognition 	 	?	``
let	's	take	a	final	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	's	prominent	in	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	debate	:	there	are	 t 	 hose 	 	who	favor	state	 re 	 cognition 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	marriage	between	one	man	and	one	woman	,	and	there	are	 t 	 hose 	 	who	favor	state	 re 	 cognition 	 	of	same	-	 s 	 ex 	 	marriage	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	here	favor	the	first	policy	:	the	state	should	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	marriage	 on 	 ly 	 	?
and	how	 man 	 y 	 	favor	the	second	,	same	-	 s 	 ex 	 	marriage	?
now	,	put	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	:	what	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	justice	and	 moral 	 ity 	 	 under 	 lie 	 	the	 argument 	 s 	 	we	have	over	marriage	?
the	 opponent 	 s 	 	of	same	-	 s 	 ex 	 	marriage	say	that	the	purpose	of	marriage	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	is	 pro 	 creation 	 	,	and	that	's	what	's	worthy	of	 honor 	 ing 	 	and	 recogn 	 izing 	 	and	 encourag 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	 defend 	 ers 	 	of	same	-	 s 	 ex 	 	marriage	say	no	,	 pro 	 creation 	 	is	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	purpose	of	marriage	;	what	about	a	 life 	 long 	 	,	mutual	,	loving	 commit 	 ment 	 	?
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	marriage	is	about	.
so	with	 flut 	 es 	 	,	with	golf	 cart 	 s 	 	,	and	even	with	a	 fierce 	 ly 	 	 contest 	 ed 	 	question	like	same	-	 s 	 ex 	 	marriage	,	aristotle	 ha 	 s 	 	a	point	.
 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	 argu 	 e 	 	about	justice	 with 	 out 	 	first	 argu 	 ing 	 	about	the	purpose	of	social	 institution 	 s 	 	and	about	what	 qual 	 ities 	 	are	worthy	of	honor	and	 re 	 cognition 	 	.
so	let	's	step	back	from	these	 case 	 s 	 	and	see	how	they	shed	light	on	the	way	we	might	improve	,	 elev 	 ate 	 	,	the	 term 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 dis 	 course 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	for	that	matter	,	around	the	world	.
there	is	a	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	think	that	if	we	engage	too	 direct 	 ly 	 	with	moral	 question 	 s 	 	in	 politic 	 s 	 	,	that	's	a	recipe	for	 disagree 	 ment 	 	,	and	for	that	matter	,	a	recipe	for	 in 	 toler 	 ance 	 	and	 coerc 	 ion 	 	.
so	better	to	 s 	 hy 	 	away	from	,	to	 ignor 	 e 	 	,	the	moral	and	the	religious	 convict 	 ions 	 	that	people	 br 	 ing 	 	to	civic	life	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	our	 discuss 	 ion 	 	 reflect 	 s 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	that	a	better	way	to	mutual	respect	is	to	engage	 direct 	 ly 	 	with	the	moral	 convict 	 ions 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	to	public	life	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	to	 requir 	 e 	 	that	people	 leav 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 deep 	 est 	 	moral	 convict 	 ions 	 	 out 	 side 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	before	they	enter	.
that	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	is	a	way	to	begin	to	 re 	 store 	 	the	art	of	 democrat 	 ic 	 	argument	.

ms	:	well	,	i	think	that	it	is	possible	.
in	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	we	have	 argument 	 s 	 	on	some	of	the	most	 fierce 	 ly 	 	held	moral	 convict 	 ions 	 	that	 student 	 s 	 	have	about	big	public	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	we	can	do	that	in	public	life	more	 general 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	my	real	dream	would	be	to	take	the	public	 tele 	 vision 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	that	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	of	the	course	--	it	's	 avail 	 able 	 	now	,	 on 	 line 	 	,	free	for	 every 	 one 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	--	and	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	we	can	partner	with	 institution 	 s 	 	,	at	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	in	india	,	in	africa	,	around	the	world	,	to	try	to	promote	civic	education	and	 al 	 so 	 	a	 rich 	 er 	 	kind	of	 democrat 	 ic 	 	debate	.
ca	:	so	you	picture	,	at	some	point	,	live	,	in	real	time	,	you	could	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	conversation	,	 invit 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	but	with	people	from	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	 join 	 ing 	 	in	?
ms	:	right	.	we	did	a	little	bit	of	it	here	with	1,500	people	in	long	beach	,	and	we	do	it	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	at	harvard	with	about	1,000	 student 	 s 	 	.
would	n't	it	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 argu 	 ing 	 	,	 engag 	 ing 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	with	big	moral	 question 	 s 	 	,	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	cultural	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	and	connect	through	a	live	video	 hook 	 up 	 	,	 student 	 s 	 	in	beijing	and	mumbai	and	in	cambridge	,	massachusetts	and	create	a	global	 class 	 room 	 	.
that	's	what	i	would	love	to	do	.
ca	:	so	,	i	would	imagine	that	there	are	a	lot	of	people	who	would	love	to	join	you	in	that	endeavor	.
michael	sandel	.	thank	you	so	much	.
