the	hindus	say	,	``	nada	brahma	,	``	one	 transl 	 ation 	 	of	which	is	,	``	the	world	is	sound	.	``
and	in	a	way	,	that	's	true	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 vib 	 rating 	 	.
in	fact	,	all	of	you	 a 	 s 	 	you	 s 	 it 	 	here	right	now	are	 vib 	 rating 	 	.
every	part	of	your	body	is	 vib 	 rating 	 	at	different	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	.
so	you	are	,	in	fact	,	a	 chor 	 d 	 	--	each	of	you	an	individual	 chor 	 d 	 	.
one	definition	of	health	may	be	that	that	 chor 	 d 	 	is	in	complete	 harmon 	 y 	 	.
your	 ear 	 s 	 	ca	n't	hear	that	 chor 	 d 	 	;	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hear	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	your	 ear 	 s 	 	can	hear	10	 octave 	 s 	 	.
 incident 	 ally 	 	,	we	see	just	one	octave	.
your	 ear 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	on	--	you	have	no	ear	lids	.
they	work	even	when	you	sleep	.
the	 small 	 est 	 	sound	you	can	perceive	 move 	 s 	 	your	 ear 	 drum 	 	just	four	atomic	 dia 	 meter 	 s 	 	.
the	 loud 	 est 	 	sound	you	can	hear	is	a	trillion	 time 	 s 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	that	.
 ear 	 s 	 	are	made	not	for	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	but	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
 listen 	 ing 	 	is	an	active	skill	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	is	 pass 	 ive 	 	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	have	to	work	at	--	it	's	a	relationship	with	sound	.
and	yet	it	's	a	skill	that	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	are	taught	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	have	you	ever	 consider 	 ed 	 	that	there	are	 listen 	 ing 	 	 position 	 s 	 	,	 place 	 s 	 	you	can	listen	from	?
here	are	two	of	them	.
reductive	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	for	.	``
it	 reduc 	 es 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	down	to	what	's	relevant	and	it	 dis 	 card 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	not	relevant	.
men	 typical 	 ly 	 	listen	 re 	 duct 	 ively 	 	.
so	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.	``
he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	here	's	your	solution	.	 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	next	.	``
that	's	the	way	we	talk	,	right	 guy 	 s 	 	?
expansive	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	with	,	``	not	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	for	.	``
it	's	got	no	destination	in	mind	--	it	's	just	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	journey	.
women	 typical 	 ly 	 	listen	 expansive 	 ly 	 	.
if	you	look	at	these	two	,	eye	contact	,	facing	each	other	,	possibly	both	 talk 	 ing 	 	at	the	same	time	.
men	,	if	you	get	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	practice	expansive	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	can	transform	your	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
the	trouble	with	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	that	so	much	of	what	we	hear	is	noise	,	 surround 	 ing 	 	us	all	the	time	.
noise	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	,	is	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	health	and	the	quality	of	life	of	25	percent	of	the	population	of	europe	.
two	percent	of	the	population	of	europe	--	that	's	16	million	people	--	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	sleep	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	by	noise	like	that	.
noise	 kill 	 s 	 	200,000	people	a	year	in	europe	.
it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	problem	.
now	,	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	little	,	if	you	had	noise	and	you	did	n't	want	to	hear	it	,	you	'd	stick	your	 finger 	 s 	 	in	your	 ear 	 s 	 	and	hum	.
these	 day 	 s 	 	,	you	can	do	a	similar	thing	,	it	just	 look 	 s 	 	a	bit	 cool 	 er 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	a	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	trouble	with	 wide 	 spread 	 	 head 	 phone 	 	use	is	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	three	 re 	 ally 	 	big	health	 issue 	 s 	 	.
the	first	 re 	 ally 	 	big	health	issue	is	a	word	that	murray	schafer	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	:	``	 schizo 	 phon 	 ia 	 	.	``
it	's	a	 dis 	 location 	 	between	what	you	see	and	what	you	hear	.
so	,	we	're	 invit 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	the	 voice 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	not	present	with	us	.
i	think	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	about	living	all	the	time	in	 schizo 	 phon 	 ia 	 	.
the	second	problem	that	 come 	 s 	 	with	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	is	 compress 	 ion 	 	.
we	squash	music	to	fit	it	 in 	 to 	 	our	pocket	and	there	is	a	cost	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 un 	 compress 	 ed 	 	piece	of	music	.
and	now	the	same	piece	of	music	with	98	percent	of	the	data	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	.
i	do	hope	that	some	of	you	at	 l 	 east 	 	can	hear	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	.
there	is	a	cost	of	 compress 	 ion 	 	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	you	 tire 	 d 	 	and	 irrit 	 able 	 	to	have	to	make	up	all	of	that	data	.
you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	imagine	it	.
it	's	not	good	for	you	in	the	long	run	.
the	third	problem	with	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	 deaf 	 ness 	 	--	noise	-	induced	 hear 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	.
ten	million	americans	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	for	one	reason	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	16	percent	--	 rough 	 ly 	 	one	in	six	--	of	american	 teenager 	 s 	 	suffer	from	noise	-	induced	 hear 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	.
one	 stud 	 y 	 	at	an	american	university	found	that	61	percent	of	college	 fresh 	 men 	 	had	 damage 	 d 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	.
we	may	be	raising	an	entire	generation	of	deaf	people	.
now	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	problem	.
i	'll	give	you	three	quick	 tip 	 s 	 	to	protect	your	 ear 	 s 	 	and	pass	these	on	to	your	children	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
professional	 hear 	 ing 	 	 protect 	 ors 	 	are	great	;	i	use	some	all	the	time	.
if	you	're	going	to	use	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	buy	the	best	 one 	 s 	 	you	can	afford	 be 	 cause 	 	quality	 mean 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	have	to	have	it	so	loud	.
if	you	ca	n't	hear	 some 	 body 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	in	a	loud	voice	,	it	's	too	loud	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	're	in	bad	sound	,	it	's	fine	to	put	your	 finger 	 s 	 	in	your	 ear 	 s 	 	or	just	move	away	from	it	.
protect	your	 ear 	 s 	 	in	that	way	.
let	's	move	away	from	bad	sound	and	look	at	some	 friend 	 s 	 	that	i	urge	you	to	seek	out	.
wwb	:	wind	,	water	,	 bird 	 s 	 	--	 stochas 	 tic 	 	natural	 sound 	 s 	 	 compose 	 d 	 	of	 lot 	 s 	 	of	individual	random	 event 	 s 	 	,	all	of	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	all	of	it	sound	that	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
seek	 t 	 hose 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	out	;	they	're	good	for	you	and	so	it	 th 	 is 	 	.
silence	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
the	elizabethans	 de 	 scribed 	 	language	 a 	 s 	 	 decor 	 ated 	 	silence	.
i	urge	you	to	move	away	from	silence	with	 intent 	 ion 	 	and	to	design	 sound 	 scapes 	 	just	like	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	.
have	a	 fore 	 ground 	 	,	a	 back 	 ground 	 	,	all	in	 beaut 	 iful 	 	proportion	.
it	's	 f 	 un 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	with	sound	.
if	you	ca	n't	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	,	get	a	professional	to	do	it	for	you	.
sound	design	is	the	future	,	and	i	think	it	's	the	way	we	're	going	to	change	the	way	the	world	 sound 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	just	run	 quick 	 ly 	 	through	eight	 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	,	eight	ways	sound	can	improve	health	.
first	,	 ultra 	 sound 	 	:	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	it	from	physical	therapy	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	now	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	treat	cancer	.
lithotripsy	--	saving	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	a	year	from	the	 scalp 	 el 	 	by	 pul 	 ver 	 izing 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	with	high	-	 intens 	 ity 	 	sound	.
sound	 heal 	 ing 	 	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 mod 	 ality 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	do	urge	you	to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	are	great	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	there	,	 treat 	 ing 	 	now	 aut 	 ism 	 	,	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	and	other	 condition 	 s 	 	.
and	music	,	of	course	.	just	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	music	is	good	for	you	,	if	it	's	music	that	's	made	with	good	 intent 	 ion 	 	,	made	with	love	,	 general 	 ly 	 	.
 devotion 	 al 	 	music	,	good	--	mozart	,	good	.
there	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 type 	 s 	 	of	music	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 health 	 y 	 	.
and	four	 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	where	you	need	to	take	some	action	and	get	 involve 	 d 	 	.
first	of	all	,	listen	 conscious 	 ly 	 	.
i	hope	that	that	after	 th 	 is 	 	talk	you	'll	be	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
it	's	a	whole	new	dimension	to	your	life	and	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	have	that	dimension	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	get	in	touch	with	making	some	sound	--	create	sound	.
the	voice	is	the	instrument	we	all	play	,	and	yet	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	are	trained	in	using	our	voice	?	get	trained	;	learn	to	 s 	 ing 	 	,	learn	to	play	an	instrument	.
 music 	 ians 	 	have	 big 	 ger 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	--	it	's	true	.
you	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	 group 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
it	's	a	fantastic	antidote	to	 schizo 	 phon 	 ia 	 	;	to	make	music	and	sound	in	a	group	of	people	,	 which 	 ever 	 	style	you	enjoy	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	.
and	let	's	take	a	 steward 	 ing 	 	role	for	the	sound	around	us	.
protect	your	 ear 	 s 	 	?	 y 	 es 	 	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	.
design	 sound 	 scapes 	 	to	be	 beaut 	 iful 	 	around	you	at	home	and	at	work	.
and	let	's	start	to	speak	up	when	people	are	 ass 	 ailing 	 	us	with	the	noise	that	i	 play 	 ed 	 	you	early	on	.
so	i	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	seven	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	right	now	to	improve	your	health	with	sound	.
my	vision	is	of	a	world	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	if	we	all	start	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	will	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	step	in	that	direction	.
so	i	urge	you	to	take	that	path	.
i	'm	 leav 	 ing 	 	you	with	a	little	more	 bird 	 song 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	you	.
i	wish	you	sound	health	.
