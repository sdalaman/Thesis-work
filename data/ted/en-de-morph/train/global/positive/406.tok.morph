 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	and	the	future	of	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	not	a	food	 to 	 day 	 	that	's	more	 malign 	 ed 	 	than	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	,	right	?
i	mean	,	it	's	 cruc 	 ified 	 	.
it	was	 out 	 law 	 ed 	 	in	chicago	for	a	while	.
it	's	 pend 	 ing 	 	here	in	california	,	and	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	in	new	york	.
it	's	like	if	you	're	a	chef	and	you	put	it	on	your	menu	,	you	risk	 be 	 ing 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	,	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	in	san	francisco	to	a	famous	chef	.

 suff 	 ice 	 	to	say	it	's	like	--	it	's	not	the	 pre 	 t 	 tiest 	 	picture	of	 sustain 	 able 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	.
the	problem	for	us	 chef 	 s 	 	is	that	it	's	so	 freak 	 in 	 	'	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	love	the	stuff	.

and	the	rest	of	the	year	they	're	free	to	roam	around	eduardo	's	land	and	eat	what	they	want	.
so	no	 ga 	 vage 	 	,	no	force	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	no	 factor 	 y 	 	-	like	 condition 	 s 	 	,	no	 cruel 	 ty 	 	.

you	know	,	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	by	definition	,	force	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 ga 	 vage 	 	,	and	that	's	what	you	get	when	you	want	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
that	is	,	 un 	 til 	 	i	went	to	eduardo	's	farm	in	extremadura	,	50	 mile 	 s 	 	north	of	seville	,	right	on	the	portugal	border	.
i	saw	first	-	hand	a	system	that	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	complex	and	then	at	the	same	time	,	like	 every 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	in	nature	,	is	 utter 	 ly 	 	simple	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	 re 	 ally 	 	from	the	first	moment	,	my	life	's	work	is	to	give	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	what	they	want	.

i	'm	just	here	to	give	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	what	they	want	.

he	's	 re 	 ally 	 	just	in	love	with	--	he	's	at	one	with	--	he	's	the	goose	 whisper 	 er 	 	.
and	when	i	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	him	,	you	know	,	i	thought	,	like	i	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	you	now	,	right	,	but	sort	of	in	the	middle	of	my	 question 	 s 	 	,	my	 excit 	 ed 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	more	i	got	to	know	him	and	his	system	,	the	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	idea	 be 	 came 	 	.

and	i	thought	,	ok	,	 excit 	 ed 	 	jew	from	new	york	,	right	?
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	a	little	too	 aggress 	 ively 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	so	you	know	,	i	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	by	the	end	of	the	day	i	was	like	,	ed	-	uar	-	do	,	you	know	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
but	he	was	still	going	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	.
i	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	too	 loud 	 ly 	 	.
so	i	 hush 	 ed 	 	my	voice	.
i	kind	of	like	 ask 	 ed 	 	these	 question 	 s 	 	and	 chat 	 ted 	 	with	him	through	a	 transl 	 ator 	 	in	kind	of	a	half	whisper	.
and	he	 stop 	 ped 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	other	side	of	the	 pad 	 dock 	 	when	i	was	around	--	``	get	the	hell	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	kid	!	``	--	when	i	 lower 	 ed 	 	my	voice	,	they	all	came	right	up	to	us	.
right	up	to	us	,	like	right	up	to	here	.
right	 a 	 long 	 	the	 f 	 ence 	 	line	.
and	 f 	 ence 	 	line	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	in	 it 	 self 	 	.
the	 f 	 ence 	 	--	like	 th 	 is 	 	conception	of	 f 	 ence 	 	that	we	have	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 back 	 ward 	 	with	him	.
the	 electric 	 ity 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 fiber 	 glass 	 	 f 	 ence 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
he	 re 	 wired 	 	it	.	he	 invent 	 ed 	 	it	.

he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
he	 electr 	 ifies 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	that	he	felt	like	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	--	and	he	 prov 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	not	just	a	 conce 	 it 	 	,	he	 prov 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	felt	 manipul 	 ated 	 	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 imprison 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 pad 	 dock 	 s 	 	.

he	felt	like	they	felt	 manipul 	 ated 	 	.
so	he	got	rid	of	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	he	got	rid	of	current	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	it	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	so	it	would	protect	them	against	 coyote 	 s 	 	and	other	 predator 	 s 	 	.
now	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
they	ate	,	and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	me	on	a	chart	,	how	they	ate	about	20	percent	more	feed	to	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 liver 	 s 	 	.
the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.

it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	garden	of	eden	.
there	's	 fig 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	there	for	the	taking	.
and	the	 iron 	 y 	 	of	 iron 	 ies 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	extremadura	,	the	area	--	what	 do 	 es 	 	extremadura	mean	?

 an 	 other 	 	 iron 	 y 	 	,	the	double	 iron 	 y 	 	is	that	on	the	 fig 	 s 	 	and	the	 o 	 live 	 s 	 	,	eduardo	can	make	more	money	selling	 t 	 hose 	 	than	he	can	on	the	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	.
he	lets	them	take	what	they	want	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	about	50	percent	.	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	fair	.	``

but	he	never	 control 	 s 	 	it	.
they	get	what	they	want	,	they	 leav 	 e 	 	the	rest	for	me	and	i	sell	it	.
his	 big 	 gest 	 	obstacle	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	was	the	 market 	 place 	 	,	which	 demand 	 s 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	bright	yellow	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
that	's	how	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	trained	.
you	want	to	look	and	see	what	good	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	is	,	it	's	got	to	be	bright	yellow	.
it	's	the	 indic 	 ation 	 	that	it	's	the	best	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.

or	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
but	he	found	 th 	 is 	 	wild	plant	 call 	 ed 	 	the	lupin	bush	.
the	lupin	bush	,	it	's	all	around	extremadura	.
he	let	it	go	to	seed	,	he	took	the	 seed 	 s 	 	,	he	 plant 	 ed 	 	it	on	his	30	 acre 	 s 	 	,	all	around	.
and	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	love	the	lupin	bush	.
not	for	the	bush	,	but	for	the	 seed 	 s 	 	.
and	when	they	eat	the	 seed 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	yellow	.

and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	like	going	down	the	 spice 	 s 	 	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	like	,	ok	,	salt	and	pepper	,	 think 	 ing 	 	he	's	 salt 	 ed 	 	and	 pepper 	 ed 	 	his	liver	.

he	 take 	 s 	 	the	liver	when	he	 harvest 	 s 	 	the	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	,	he	 stick 	 s 	 	them	in	 th 	 is 	 	jar	and	he	 con 	 fit 	 s 	 	it	.
no	salt	,	no	pepper	,	no	oil	,	no	 spice 	 s 	 	.
what	?
we	went	back	out	for	the	final	tour	of	the	farm	,	and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	me	the	wild	pepper	 plant 	 s 	 	and	the	 plant 	 s 	 	that	he	made	 s 	 ure 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	on	his	farm	for	 s 	 al 	 in 	 ity 	 	.

they	create	a	dish	where	all	the	 vector 	 s 	 	point	at	us	.
with	eduardo	it	's	about	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	nature	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	think	 fitting 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	gift	from	god	,	with	god	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	good	work	.

i	flew	home	,	i	'm	on	the	flight	with	my	little	black	book	and	i	took	,	you	know	,	 page 	 s 	 	and	 page 	 s 	 	of	 note 	 s 	 	about	it	.

he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	think	it	's	an	insult	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	.	``
and	i	wrote	,	insult	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
i	'm	on	the	plane	and	i	'm	just	 tear 	 ing 	 	my	hair	out	.
it	's	like	,	why	did	n't	i	follow	up	on	that	?
what	the	hell	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
insult	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
so	i	did	some	research	when	i	got	back	,	and	here	's	what	i	found	.
the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
jews	 invent 	 ed 	 	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
true	story	.

and	they	 s 	 laughter 	 ed 	 	them	,	used	the	fat	 through 	 out 	 	the	winter	for	 cook 	 ing 	 	.

the	pharaoh	got	--	i	 s 	 wear 	 	to	god	.
the	pharaoh	got	wind	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	 want 	 ed 	 	to	taste	it	.
he	 taste 	 d 	 	it	and	fell	in	love	with	it	.
he	 start 	 ed 	 	 demand 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	he	did	n't	want	it	just	in	the	fall	,	he	 want 	 ed 	 	it	all	year	round	.
and	he	 demand 	 ed 	 	that	the	jews	supply	 en 	 ough 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	.

and	they	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	what	?	 ga 	 vage 	 	.
they	 invent 	 ed 	 	 ga 	 vage 	 	in	a	great	moment	of	fear	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 provide 	 d 	 	the	pharaoh	with	 ga 	 vage 	 	liver	,	and	the	good	stuff	they	 ke 	 pt 	 	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 suppose 	 d 	 ly 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	.	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	one	.
that	's	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	think	about	it	,	it	's	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	industrial	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
it	's	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	what	we	eat	 to 	 day 	 	.
most	of	what	we	eat	 to 	 day 	 	.
mega	-	 farm 	 s 	 	,	feed	 lot 	 s 	 	,	chemical	 amend 	 ments 	 	,	long	-	distance	travel	,	food	 process 	 ing 	 	.
all	of	it	,	our	food	system	.
that	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	insult	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	's	an	insult	to	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 law 	 s 	 	of	nature	and	of	biology	.
 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	beef	cattle	or	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 chicken 	 s 	 	,	or	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 broc 	 coli 	 	or	brussels	 sprout 	 s 	 	,	or	in	the	case	of	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	's	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	 cat 	 fish 	 	--	which	 whole 	 sale 	 	are	going	out	of	business	.
 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	it	's	a	 mind 	 set 	 	that	is	 re 	 mini 	 s 	 cent 	 	of	general	 motor 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 root 	 ed 	 	in	 extra 	 ction 	 	.
take	more	,	sell	more	,	waste	more	.
and	for	the	future	it	wo	n't	serve	us	.
jonas	salk	 ha 	 s 	 	a	great	quote	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	all	the	 insect 	 s 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	life	on	earth	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	would	disappear	 with 	 in 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	life	on	earth	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	would	flourish	.	``
and	he	's	right	.
we	need	now	to	adopt	a	new	conception	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	new	.
one	in	which	we	stop	 treat 	 ing 	 	the	planet	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	some	kind	of	business	in	 liquid 	 ation 	 	.
and	stop	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	under	the	guise	of	cheap	food	.
we	can	start	by	looking	to	 farm 	 ers 	 	like	eduardo	.
 farm 	 ers 	 	that	 re 	 ly 	 	on	nature	for	 solution 	 s 	 	,	for	 answer 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 im 	 posing 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	on	nature	.
 listen 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	janine	benyus	,	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 think 	 ers 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	nature	's	 oper 	 ating 	 	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.	``
that	's	what	eduardo	 do 	 es 	 	,	and	 do 	 es 	 	so	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	.
and	what	he	 show 	 ed 	 	me	and	what	he	can	show	all	of	us	,	i	think	,	is	that	the	great	thing	for	 chef 	 s 	 	,	the	great	 bless 	 ing 	 	for	 chef 	 s 	 	,	and	for	people	that	care	about	food	and	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	is	that	the	most	 eco 	 logical 	 	choice	for	food	is	 al 	 so 	 	the	most	 ethic 	 al 	 	choice	for	food	.
 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	brussels	 sprout 	 s 	 	or	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	,	and	i	have	n't	found	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	,	but	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	,	the	most	 delic 	 ious 	 	choice	.
that	's	serendipitous	.
