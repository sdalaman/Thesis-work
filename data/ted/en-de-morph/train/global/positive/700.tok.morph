chris	anderson	:	thank	you	so	much	,	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	that	was	both	 fasci 	 nating 	 	and	 quit 	 e 	 	inspiring	.
so	,	you	're	 call 	 ing 	 	for	a	global	ethic	.
would	you	 de 	 scribe 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	global	 citizen 	 ship 	 	?
is	that	an	idea	that	you	 believ 	 e 	 	in	,	and	how	would	you	define	that	?
gordon	 brow 	 n 	 	:	i	think	it	is	about	global	 citizen 	 ship 	 	.	it	's	about	 recogn 	 izing 	 	our	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
there	is	so	much	to	do	over	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	that	is	obvious	to	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	to	build	a	better	world	.
and	there	is	so	much	 share 	 d 	 	sense	of	what	we	need	to	do	,	that	it	is	vital	that	we	all	come	together	.
but	we	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	have	the	 mean 	 s 	 	to	do	so	.
so	there	are	 challeng 	 es 	 	to	be	met	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	global	 citizen 	 ship 	 	will	 simpl 	 y 	 	grow	out	of	people	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	 a 	 cross 	 	 continent 	 s 	 	.
but	then	,	of	course	,	the	task	is	to	create	the	 institution 	 s 	 	that	make	that	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	work	.
but	i	do	n't	think	we	should	 under 	 estimate 	 	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	to	which	massive	 change 	 s 	 	in	technology	make	possible	the	 link 	 ing 	 	up	of	people	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
ca	:	but	people	get	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	global	 citizen 	 ship 	 	,	but	then	they	get	 con 	 fused 	 	a	bit	 aga 	 in 	 	when	they	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 patriot 	 ism 	 	,	and	how	to	combine	these	two	.
i	mean	,	you	're	 elect 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	with	a	brief	to	bat	for	britain	.
how	do	you	reconcile	the	two	 thing 	 s 	 	?
gb	:	well	,	of	course	national	 ident 	 ity 	 	 remain 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	it	's	not	at	the	expense	of	people	 accept 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	global	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	.
and	i	think	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	a	 recess 	 ion 	 	is	that	people	 be 	 come 	 	more	 protect 	 ion 	 ist 	 	,	they	look	in	on	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	they	try	to	protect	 the 	 ir 	 	own	nation	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	at	the	expense	of	other	 nation 	 s 	 	.
when	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	the	motor	of	the	world	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	it	can	not	move	forward	 un 	 less 	 	there	is	trade	between	the	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	any	nation	that	would	 be 	 come 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 ist 	 	over	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	would	 depriv 	 e 	 	 it 	 self 	 	of	the	chance	of	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	growth	in	the	world	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
so	,	you	've	got	to	have	a	 health 	 y 	 	sense	of	 patriot 	 ism 	 	;	that	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	you	've	got	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	and	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	can	not	be	 solve 	 d 	 	by	one	nation	and	one	nation	 al 	 one 	 	.
ca	:	well	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.	but	what	do	you	do	when	the	two	come	 in 	 to 	 	conflict	and	you	're	 force 	 d 	 	to	make	a	decision	that	either	is	in	britain	's	interest	,	or	the	interest	of	britons	,	or	 citizen 	 s 	 	 else 	 where 	 	in	the	world	?
gb	:	well	i	think	we	can	 persuad 	 e 	 	people	that	what	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	britain	's	long	-	term	 interest 	 s 	 	,	what	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	america	's	long	-	term	 interest 	 s 	 	,	is	proper	 engage 	 ment 	 	with	the	rest	of	the	world	,	and	taking	the	action	that	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
there	is	a	great	story	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	told	about	richard	nixon	.
1958	,	ghana	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	,	so	it	is	just	over	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
richard	nixon	 go 	 es 	 	to	represent	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	government	at	the	 celebr 	 ations 	 	for	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	in	ghana	.
and	it	's	one	of	his	first	 out 	 ing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	to	an	african	country	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	know	what	to	do	,	so	he	 start 	 s 	 	going	around	the	crowd	and	 start 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	people	in	the	crowd	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	to	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	way	,	``	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	feel	to	be	free	?	``
and	he	's	going	around	,	``	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	feel	to	be	free	?	``
``	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	feel	to	be	free	?	``
and	then	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	how	should	i	know	?	i	come	from	alabama	.	``
and	that	was	the	1950s	.
now	,	what	is	 remark 	 able 	 	is	that	civil	 right 	 s 	 	in	america	 we 	 re 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	in	the	1960s	.
but	what	is	 equal 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	is	 socio 	 economic 	 	 right 	 s 	 	in	africa	have	not	 move 	 d 	 	forward	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	even	since	the	age	of	 colonial 	 ism 	 	.
and	yet	,	america	and	africa	have	got	a	common	interest	.
and	we	have	got	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	if	we	do	n't	link	up	with	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	are	 sens 	 ible 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	and	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	in	africa	,	to	work	together	for	common	 cause 	 s 	 	,	then	the	danger	of	al	qaeda	and	related	 group 	 s 	 	making	progress	in	africa	is	 ver 	 y 	 	big	.
so	,	i	would	say	that	what	 seem 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	to	be	 al 	 truism 	 	,	in	relation	to	africa	,	or	in	relation	to	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	is	more	than	that	.	it	is	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	self	-	interest	for	us	to	work	with	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	i	would	say	that	national	interest	and	,	if	you	like	,	what	is	the	global	interest	to	tackle	poverty	and	climate	change	do	,	in	the	long	run	,	come	together	.
and	 what 	 ever 	 	the	short	-	run	price	for	taking	action	on	climate	change	or	taking	action	on	security	,	or	taking	action	to	provide	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	people	for	education	,	these	are	 price 	 s 	 	that	are	worth	 pay 	 ing 	 	so	that	you	build	a	 strong 	 er 	 	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	where	people	feel	able	to	feel	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	each	other	and	are	able	to	communicate	with	each	other	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	build	 strong 	 er 	 	 link 	 s 	 	between	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
ca	:	we	're	in	oxford	,	which	is	the	home	of	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	thought	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
and	so	here	is	one	that	kind	of	 go 	 es 	 	--	i	still	just	want	to	draw	out	on	 th 	 is 	 	issue	.
so	,	you	're	on	 vac 	 ation 	 	at	a	nice	beach	,	and	word	 come 	 s 	 	through	that	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	massive	 earth 	 quake 	 	and	that	there	is	a	tsunami	 advanc 	 ing 	 	on	the	beach	.
one	end	of	the	beach	there	is	a	house	 contain 	 ing 	 	a	family	of	five	nigerians	.
and	at	the	other	end	of	the	beach	there	is	a	single	brit	.
you	have	time	to	--	you	have	time	to	alert	one	house	.	what	do	you	do	?
gb	:	modern	 communication 	 s 	 	.
alert	both	.
i	do	agree	that	my	 respons 	 ibility 	 	is	first	of	all	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	people	in	our	country	are	safe	.
and	i	would	n't	like	 any 	 thing 	 	that	is	 s 	 aid 	 	 to 	 day 	 	to	suggest	that	i	am	 diminish 	 ing 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	that	each	individual	 lead 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	country	.
but	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	suggest	that	there	is	a	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	open	to	us	that	was	never	open	to	us	before	.
but	the	power	to	communicate	 a 	 cross 	 	 border 	 s 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	organize	the	world	in	a	different	way	.
and	i	think	,	look	at	the	tsunami	,	it	's	a	classic	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
where	was	the	early	 war 	 ning 	 	 system 	 s 	 	?
you	know	?	where	was	the	world	 act 	 ing 	 	together	to	deal	with	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	they	 k 	 new 	 	 a 	 rose 	 	from	the	potential	for	 earth 	 quake 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	potential	for	climate	change	?
and	when	the	world	 start 	 s 	 	to	work	together	,	with	better	early	 war 	 ning 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	then	you	can	deal	with	some	of	these	 problem 	 s 	 	in	a	far	better	way	.
i	just	think	we	're	not	 see 	 ing 	 	,	at	the	moment	,	the	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	open	to	us	by	the	ability	of	people	to	cooperate	in	a	world	where	either	there	was	isolationism	before	or	there	was	 limit 	 ed 	 	 alliance 	 s 	 	based	on	convenience	which	never	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	you	to	deal	with	some	of	the	central	 problem 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	but	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 frust 	 ration 	 	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	lot	people	have	,	like	people	in	the	audience	here	,	where	we	love	the	kind	of	language	that	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
it	is	inspiring	.	a	lot	of	us	 believ 	 e 	 	that	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	the	world	's	future	.
and	yet	,	when	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	 change 	 s 	 	,	you	 sudden 	 ly 	 	hear	 politic 	 ians 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	,	you	know	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	life	of	one	american	soldier	is	worth	 count 	 less 	 	 number 	 s 	 	of	iraqi	 civil 	 ians 	 	.
when	the	 ped 	 al 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	the	metal	,	the	 ideal 	 ism 	 	can	get	 move 	 d 	 	away	.
i	'm	just	 wonder 	 ing 	 	how	--	 whet 	 her 	 	you	can	see	that	changing	over	time	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	see	in	britain	that	there	are	changing	 attitude 	 s 	 	,	and	that	people	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 support 	 ive 	 	of	the	kind	of	global	ethic	that	you	talk	about	.
gb	:	i	think	every	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	every	faith	,	and	i	'm	not	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	here	to	people	of	faith	or	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	global	ethic	at	the	center	of	 it 	 s 	 	 cre 	 do 	 	.
and	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	jewish	or	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	muslim	or	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	hindu	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	sikh	,	the	same	global	ethic	is	at	the	heart	of	each	of	these	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
so	,	i	think	you	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	people	 instinct 	 ively 	 	see	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	that	moral	sense	.
so	you	're	building	on	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	not	 pur 	 e 	 	self	-	interest	.
you	're	building	on	people	's	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 value 	 s 	 	--	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	they	're	 candle 	 s 	 	that	burn	 ver 	 y 	 	 d 	 im 	 ly 	 	on	certain	 occasion 	 s 	 	.
but	it	is	a	set	of	 value 	 s 	 	that	can	not	,	in	my	view	,	be	 extingu 	 ish 	 ed 	 	.
then	the	question	is	,	how	do	you	make	that	change	happen	?
how	do	you	 persuad 	 e 	 	people	that	it	is	in	 the 	 ir 	 	interest	to	build	strong	...	after	the	second	world	war	,	we	built	 institution 	 s 	 	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	the	imf	,	the	world	bank	,	the	world	trade	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	the	marshall	plan	.
there	was	a	period	in	which	people	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	an	act	of	creation	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 institution 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	new	.
but	they	are	now	out	of	date	.	they	do	n't	deal	with	the	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	ca	n't	deal	with	the	 environment 	 al 	 	problem	through	 exist 	 ing 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	.
you	ca	n't	deal	with	the	security	problem	in	the	way	that	you	need	to	.
you	ca	n't	deal	with	the	economic	and	financial	problem	.
so	we	have	got	to	 re 	 build 	 	our	global	 institution 	 s 	 	,	build	them	in	a	way	that	is	 suit 	 able 	 	to	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	if	you	look	at	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	we	face	,	it	is	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	people	to	have	the	confidence	that	we	can	build	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	with	the	 institution 	 s 	 	that	are	 found 	 ed 	 	on	these	 rule 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	come	back	to	my	 initi 	 al 	 	point	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	think	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 im 	 possible 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	apartheid	would	have	gone	in	1990	,	or	that	the	berlin	wall	would	have	 fall 	 en 	 	at	the	turn	of	the	'80s	and	'90s	,	or	that	 poli 	 o 	 	could	be	 eradic 	 ated 	 	,	or	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	60	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 no 	 body 	 	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	that	a	man	could	have	gone	to	the	moon	.
all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
by	 tack 	 ling 	 	the	 im 	 possible 	 	,	you	make	the	 im 	 possible 	 	possible	.
ca	:	and	we	have	had	a	speaker	who	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 ver 	 y 	 	thing	,	and	 swallow 	 ed 	 	a	 s 	 word 	 	right	after	that	,	which	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
gb	:	 follow 	 ed 	 	my	 s 	 word 	 	will	swallow	.
ca	:	but	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	a	true	global	ethic	is	for	 some 	 one 	 	to	say	,	``	i	 believ 	 e 	 	the	life	of	every	human	on	the	planet	is	worth	the	same	,	equal	 consider 	 ation 	 	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	 national 	 ity 	 	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	.	``
and	you	have	 politic 	 ians 	 	who	have	--	you	're	 elect 	 ed 	 	.	in	a	way	,	you	ca	n't	say	that	.
even	if	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	,	you	ca	n't	say	that	.	you	're	 elect 	 ed 	 	for	britain	's	 interest 	 s 	 	.
gb	:	we	have	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	protect	.
i	mean	look	,	1918	,	the	 treat 	 y 	 	of	versailles	,	and	all	the	 treat 	 ies 	 	before	that	,	the	 treat 	 y 	 	of	westphalia	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	,	 we 	 re 	 	about	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	sovereign	right	of	individual	 count 	 ries 	 	to	do	what	they	want	.
since	then	,	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	forward	,	 part 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	the	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	,	and	people	's	concern	about	the	 right 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 territ 	 ories 	 	where	they	need	 protect 	 ion 	 	,	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	we	saw	in	rwanda	,	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	we	saw	in	bosnia	.
the	idea	of	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	protect	all	 individual 	 s 	 	who	are	in	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	they	are	at	 human 	 itarian 	 	risk	is	now	 be 	 ing 	 	 establish 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	principle	which	 govern 	 s 	 	the	world	.
so	,	while	i	ca	n't	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	say	that	britain	will	rush	to	the	aid	of	any	citizen	of	any	country	,	in	danger	,	i	can	say	that	britain	is	in	a	position	where	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	other	 count 	 ries 	 	so	that	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	you	have	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	protect	people	who	are	 victim 	 s 	 	of	either	genocide	or	 human 	 itarian 	 	attack	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 accept 	 ed 	 	by	the	whole	world	.
now	,	in	the	end	,	that	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 achiev 	 ed 	 	if	your	 inter 	 national 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	work	well	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	able	to	do	so	.
and	that	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	what	the	future	role	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	and	what	it	can	do	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	.
but	,	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	protect	is	a	new	idea	that	is	,	in	a	sense	,	taken	over	from	the	idea	of	self	-	 determi 	 nation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	principle	 govern 	 ing 	 	the	 inter 	 national 	 	community	.
ca	:	can	you	picture	,	in	our	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	,	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	ever	going	out	on	a	platform	of	the	kind	of	full	-	form	global	ethic	,	global	 citizen 	 ship 	 	?
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	``	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	all	people	 a 	 cross 	 	the	planet	have	equal	 consider 	 ation 	 	,	and	if	in	power	we	will	act	in	that	way	.
and	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	people	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	are	 al 	 so 	 	now	global	 citizen 	 s 	 	and	will	support	that	ethic	.	.	.	``
gb	:	is	that	not	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	debate	about	climate	change	?
we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	that	you	can	not	solve	the	problem	of	climate	change	in	one	country	;	you	've	got	to	involve	all	 count 	 ries 	 	.
you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	that	you	must	,	and	you	have	a	duty	to	help	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	that	can	not	afford	to	deal	with	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	climate	change	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	you	want	a	deal	with	all	the	different	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	world	where	we	're	all	bound	together	to	cutting	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	in	a	way	that	is	to	the	benefit	of	the	whole	world	.
we	've	never	had	 th 	 is 	 	before	 be 	 cause 	 	kyoto	did	n't	work	.
if	you	could	get	a	deal	at	copenhagen	,	where	people	 agree 	 d 	 	,	a	,	that	there	was	a	long	-	term	target	for	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 	 cut 	 s 	 	,	b	,	that	there	was	short	-	range	 target 	 s 	 	that	had	to	be	met	so	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	just	abstract	;	it	was	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	making	 decision 	 s 	 	now	that	would	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	now	,	and	if	you	could	then	find	a	 fin 	 anc 	 ing 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	that	 me 	 ant 	 	that	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	hurt	by	our	 in 	 ability 	 	to	deal	with	climate	change	over	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	and	 decade 	 s 	 	are	 give 	 n 	 	special	help	so	that	they	can	move	to	energy	-	efficient	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	and	they	are	in	a	position	 financial 	 ly 	 	to	be	able	to	afford	the	long	-	term	 invest 	 ment 	 	that	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	cutting	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	then	you	are	 treat 	 ing 	 	the	world	 equal 	 ly 	 	,	by	giving	 consider 	 ation 	 	to	every	part	of	the	planet	and	the	 need 	 s 	 	they	have	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	 every 	 body 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	to	do	more	 financial 	 ly 	 	to	help	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	mean	there	is	equal	 consider 	 ation 	 	for	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 citizen 	 s 	 	in	a	single	planet	.
ca	:	 y 	 es 	 	.	and	then	of	course	the	 theor 	 y 	 	is	still	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	get	rent	 a 	 part 	 	by	different	 count 	 ries 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	over	 the 	 ir 	 	own	individual	 interest 	 s 	 	.
gb	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	but	i	think	europe	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	position	,	which	is	27	 count 	 ries 	 	have	 al 	 ready 	 	come	together	.
i	mean	,	the	great	 difficult 	 y 	 	in	europe	is	if	you	're	at	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	and	27	people	speak	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
but	we	did	get	an	 agree 	 ment 	 	on	climate	change	.
america	 ha 	 s 	 	made	 it 	 s 	 	first	disposition	on	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	bill	that	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	should	be	congratulated	for	 get 	 ting 	 	through	congress	.
japan	 ha 	 s 	 	made	an	 announce 	 ment 	 	.
 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	have	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	scientific	evidence	.
and	now	we	've	got	to	move	them	to	accept	a	long	-	term	target	,	and	then	short	-	term	 target 	 s 	 	.
but	more	progress	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	made	,	i	think	,	in	the	last	few	 week 	 s 	 	than	had	 be 	 en 	 	made	for	some	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	is	a	strong	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	if	we	work	together	,	we	can	get	that	 agree 	 ment 	 	to	copenhagen	.
i	 certain 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	forward	 proposal 	 s 	 	that	would	have	 allow 	 ed 	 	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	to	feel	that	we	have	taken	 in 	 to 	 	account	 the 	 ir 	 	specific	 need 	 s 	 	.
and	we	would	help	them	adapt	.
and	we	would	help	them	make	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	to	a	low	carbon	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
i	do	think	a	reform	of	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	is	vital	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
when	the	imf	was	 create 	 d 	 	in	the	1940s	,	it	was	 create 	 d 	 	with	 resource 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	five	percent	or	so	of	the	world	's	gdp	.
the	imf	now	 ha 	 s 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	one	percent	.
it	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	make	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	that	ought	to	be	made	in	a	period	of	crisis	.
so	,	we	've	got	to	 re 	 build 	 	the	world	 institution 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	a	big	task	:	 persuad 	 ing 	 	all	the	different	 count 	 ries 	 	with	the	different	 vot 	 ing 	 	 share 	 s 	 	in	these	 institution 	 s 	 	to	do	so	.
there	is	a	story	told	about	the	three	world	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	the	day	 get 	 ting 	 	a	chance	to	get	some	 ad 	 vice 	 	from	god	.
and	the	story	is	told	that	bill	clinton	went	to	god	and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	when	there	will	be	 success 	 ful 	 	climate	change	and	a	low	carbon	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	god	 s 	 hook 	 	his	head	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	not	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	not	 th 	 is 	 	decade	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	even	in	your	 life 	 time 	 	.	``
and	bill	clinton	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	in	 tear 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	get	what	he	 want 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	the	story	is	that	barroso	,	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	european	commission	,	went	to	god	and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	when	will	we	get	a	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	of	global	growth	?	``
and	god	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	not	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	not	in	 th 	 is 	 	decade	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	in	your	 life 	 time 	 	.	``
so	barroso	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	 cry 	 ing 	 	and	in	 tear 	 s 	 	.
and	then	the	 secret 	 ary 	 	general	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	came	up	to	speak	to	god	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	when	will	our	 inter 	 national 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	work	?	``
and	god	 cri 	 ed 	 	.
it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	reform	of	 institution 	 s 	 	is	the	next	stage	after	 agree 	 ing 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	there	is	a	clear	ethic	 up 	 on 	 	which	we	can	build	.
ca	:	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	i	think	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	in	the	audience	who	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	 appreci 	 ative 	 	of	the	 effort 	 s 	 	you	made	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	financial	mess	we	got	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	.
and	there	are	 certain 	 ly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	the	audience	who	will	be	 cheer 	 ing 	 	you	on	 a 	 s 	 	you	seek	to	advance	 th 	 is 	 	global	ethic	.	thank	you	so	much	for	coming	to	ted	.
gb	:	well	,	thank	you	.
