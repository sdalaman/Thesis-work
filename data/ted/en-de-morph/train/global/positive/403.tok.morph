i	have	a	story	,	a	story	that	i	would	like	to	share	with	you	.
and	it	's	an	african	story	.
it	is	a	story	of	hope	,	 resili 	 ence 	 	and	glamour	.
there	was	hollywood	.
then	came	bollywood	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	have	nollywood	,	the	third	-	largest	film	industry	in	the	world	.
in	2006	 al 	 one 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	2,000	 film 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	made	in	nigeria	.
now	,	try	to	imagine	40	,	50	 film 	 s 	 	 wrap 	 ped 	 	,	 distribut 	 ed 	 	,	every	week	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	lagos	,	nigeria	and	west	africa	.
some	 estimate 	 s 	 	put	the	value	of	 th 	 is 	 	industry	at	250	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	if	not	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 expand 	 ing 	 	.
but	keep	in	mind	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	foreign	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	government	aid	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	against	all	 odd 	 s 	 	,	in	one	of	the	most	difficult	 moment 	 s 	 	in	nigerian	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
the	industry	is	15	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	so	 may 	 be 	 	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	now	,	why	,	how	,	an	italian	 film 	 maker 	 	based	in	boston	is	so	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	story	?
and	so	i	think	i	have	to	tell	you	just	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	,	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	about	my	personal	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	there	is	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
my	 grand 	 father 	 	lived	most	of	his	life	and	is	buried	in	zambia	.
my	father	 al 	 so 	 	lived	most	of	his	adult	life	in	east	africa	.
and	i	was	born	in	zambia	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	left	when	i	was	 on 	 ly 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	that	africa	was	 th 	 is 	 	big	part	of	my	life	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	was	a	place	where	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	walk	.
i	think	i	 utter 	 ed 	 	the	first	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	my	family	 b 	 ought 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	first	home	.
so	when	we	came	back	to	italy	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	remember	the	most	is	my	family	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	hard	time	to	share	 st 	 ories 	 	.
it	 seem 	 ed 	 	that	for	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	and	 friend 	 s 	 	,	africa	was	either	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 otic 	 	place	,	 th 	 is 	 	 imagin 	 ary 	 	land	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	or	the	place	of	 horr 	 or 	 	,	famine	.
and	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	caught	in	 th 	 is 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 	.
and	i	remember	 re 	 ally 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	to	talk	about	africa	 a 	 s 	 	a	place	where	we	lived	and	people	live	and	go	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	have	 dream 	 s 	 	like	we	all	have	.
so	when	i	read	in	a	 news 	 paper 	 	in	the	business	page	the	story	of	nollywood	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	tell	a	story	that	 go 	 es 	 	against	all	these	 pre 	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	 not 	 ions 	 	.
here	i	can	tell	a	story	of	africans	making	 movie 	 s 	 	like	i	do	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	felt	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	inspiration	for	me	.
i	have	the	good	fortune	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 film 	 maker 	 	-	in	-	residence	at	the	center	of	digital	 im 	 aging 	 	 art 	 s 	 	at	boston	university	.
and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	look	how	digital	technology	is	changing	,	and	how	young	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	 film 	 makers 	 	can	make	 movie 	 s 	 	at	a	fraction	of	the	cost	.
so	when	i	 pro 	 posed 	 	the	story	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	had	all	the	support	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	film	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	had	the	support	,	i	found	two	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	in	crime	in	 th 	 is 	 	adventure	.
aimee	corrigan	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 talent 	 ed 	 	and	young	 photograph 	 er 	 	,	and	robert	caputo	,	a	friend	and	a	mentor	,	who	is	a	veteran	of	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	,	and	told	me	,	``	you	know	,	franco	,	in	25	 year 	 s 	 	of	 cover 	 ing 	 	africa	,	i	do	n't	know	if	i	have	come	 a 	 cross 	 	a	story	that	is	so	full	of	hope	and	so	 f 	 un 	 	.	``
so	we	went	to	lagos	in	october	2005	.
and	we	went	to	lagos	to	meet	bond	emeruwa	,	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 talent 	 ed 	 	film	director	who	is	with	us	 to 	 night 	 	.
the	plan	was	to	give	you	a	portrait	of	nollywood	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	film	industry	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	bond	in	his	quest	to	make	an	action	movie	that	 deal 	 s 	 	with	the	issue	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	police	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
and	he	had	nine	 day 	 s 	 	to	make	it	.
we	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	good	story	.
in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	we	had	to	cover	nollywood	,	and	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	a	lot	of	 film 	 makers 	 	.
but	i	do	n't	want	to	create	too	 man 	 y 	 	 expect 	 ations 	 	.
i	would	like	to	show	you	six	 minute 	 s 	 	.
and	these	are	six	 minute 	 s 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	prepared	for	the	ted	audience	.
there	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	from	the	 document 	 ary 	 	,	but	they	are	re	-	 edit 	 ed 	 	and	made	for	you	,	ok	?
so	i	guess	it	's	a	world	 pre 	 mi 	 er 	 	.
man	:	action	.
milverton	nwokedi	:	you	cut	a	nice	movie	with	just	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	nigeria	here	.
and	you	shoot	in	seven	 day 	 s 	 	.
peace	piberesima	:	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 film 	 s 	 	for	the	 masse 	 s 	 	.
we	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 film 	 s 	 	for	the	elite	and	the	people	in	 the 	 ir 	 	glass	 house 	 s 	 	.
they	can	afford	to	watch	 the 	 ir 	 	``	robocop	``	and	 what 	 ever 	 	.
mahmood	ali	balogun	:	i	think	 film 	 making 	 	in	nigeria	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	work	in	it	,	is	a	kind	of	 sub 	 s 	 ist 	 ence 	 	 film 	 making 	 	--	what	they	do	to	make	a	living	.
it	's	not	the	 f 	 ancy 	 	 film 	 making 	 	where	you	say	,	oh	,	you	want	to	put	all	the	razzmatazz	of	hollywood	,	and	where	you	have	big	 budget 	 s 	 	.
here	is	that	you	make	these	 film 	 s 	 	,	it	 sell 	 s 	 	,	you	jump	onto	the	location	 aga 	 in 	 	to	make	 an 	 other 	 	film	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	do	n't	make	the	next	film	,	you	're	not	going	to	feed	.
bond	emeruwa	:	so	while	we	're	 entertain 	 ing 	 	,	we	should	be	able	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	power	of	 audio 	 visual 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	90	percent	of	the	population	will	watch	nollywood	.
i	think	it	's	the	most	 vi 	 able 	 	vehicle	right	now	to	pass	information	 a 	 cross 	 	a	 dedicate 	 d 	 	cable	.
so	if	you	're	making	a	movie	,	no	matter	what	your	 top 	 ic 	 	is	,	put	in	a	 mess 	 age 	 	in	there	.
woman	:	you	still	have	to	report	the	incident	.
he	 need 	 s 	 	proper	medical	attention	.
pp	:	i	keep	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explain	to	people	,	it	's	not	about	the	quality	at	the	moment	--	the	quality	is	coming	.
i	mean	,	there	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 film 	 s 	 	that	people	are	making	for	quality	,	but	the	first	thing	you	have	to	remember	about	 th 	 is 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	that	africa	still	 ha 	 s 	 	people	that	live	on	one	dollar	a	day	,	and	these	are	the	people	that	 re 	 ally 	 	watch	these	 film 	 s 	 	.
sonny	mcdon	w	:	nollywood	is	a	fantastic	industry	that	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	born	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	nollywood	can	come	out	of	africa	.
lancelot	imasen	:	but	our	 film 	 s 	 	,	they	are	 st 	 ories 	 	that	our	people	can	 re 	 late 	 	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	are	 st 	 ories 	 	about	our	people	,	for	our	people	.
and	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	,	they	are	 glu 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	screen	 when 	 ever 	 	they	see	the	story	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	suspense	,	 f 	 un 	 	and	 intrigu 	 e 	 	.
it	's	the	 block 	 buster 	 	 come 	 dy 	 	.
you	'll	crack	your	 rib 	 s 	 	.
bernard	pinayon	agbaosi	:	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	so	deep	 in 	 to 	 	the	foreign	 movie 	 s 	 	.
it	's	all	about	the	foreign	 movie 	 s 	 	.
but	we	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	too	.
we	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	when	the	world	 s 	 ees 	 	it	,	they	say	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	nigeria	.
man	:	just	arrest	 your 	 self 	 	,	 s 	 er 	 ge 	 ant 	 	.
do	n't	embarrass	 your 	 self 	 	.
come	on	.	do	n't	run	away	.	come	back	.	come	back	.
smw	:	you	can	now	walk	the	street	and	see	a	role	model	.
it	's	not	just	what	you	see	in	picture	.
you	see	the	person	live	.
you	see	how	he	 talk 	 s 	 	.	you	see	how	he	 live 	 s 	 	.
he	 influence 	 s 	 	you	 re 	 ally 	 	good	,	you	know	.
it	's	not	just	what	you	see	in	the	picture	.
it	is	not	what	you	hear	,	you	know	,	from	the	western	press	.
man	:	see	you	.	bye	.
action	.
saint	obi	:	i	was	so	 fascinate 	 d 	 	,	you	know	,	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 cow 	 boy 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	.
but	then	when	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	my	country	,	at	that	time	there	was	so	much	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
for	a	young	man	to	 re 	 ally 	 	make	it	out	here	,	you	got	to	think	of	some	negative	 thing 	 s 	 	and	all	that	,	or	some	kind	of	 vice 	 s 	 	.
and	i	did	n't	want	that	,	you	know	.
and	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	i	could	be	 success 	 ful 	 	in	life	 a 	 s 	 	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	crime	,	 with 	 out 	 	 cheat 	 ing 	 	 no 	 body 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	no	lies	.
just	me	and	god	-	 give 	 n 	 	talent	.
man	:	let	's	go	.
ok	,	it	's	time	to	kick	some	ass	.
cover	 th 	 is 	 	.	it	's	your	own	.
move	it	.
roboger	animadu	:	in	big	 count 	 ries 	 	,	when	they	do	the	 movie 	 s 	 	,	they	have	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	in	place	.
but	here	,	we	 improv 	 ise 	 	these	 item 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 gun 	 shot 	 s 	 	.
like	they	go	,	here	,	now	,	now	,	you	see	the	gun	there	,	but	you	wo	n't	see	any	 gun 	 s 	 	shot	,	we	use	knock	-	out	.
kevin	 book 	 s 	 	ikeduba	:	what	i	'm	 scar 	 ed 	 	of	is	just	the	explosion	will	come	up	in	my	face	.
woman	:	that	's	why	i	use	 en 	 ough 	 	 mask 	 ing 	 	tape	.
the	 mask 	 ing 	 	tape	will	hold	it	.
wat	,	wait	.	just	hold	 th 	 is 	 	for	me	.
kbi	:	i	'm	just	 tell 	 ing 	 	her	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	she	 place 	 s 	 	it	well	so	that	it	wo	n't	affect	my	face	--	the	explosion	,	you	know	.
but	she	's	a	professional	.	she	 know 	 s 	 	what	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	protect	my	face	too	.
 th 	 is 	 	ai	n't	going	to	be	my	last	movie	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	nollywood	,	where	the	magic	 live 	 s 	 	.
ra	:	so	now	you	're	about	to	see	how	we	do	our	own	 movie 	 s 	 	here	,	with	or	 with 	 out 	 	any	 assist 	 ance 	 	from	 any 	 body 	 	.
man	:	action	.
cut	.
franco	sacchi	:	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	say	,	so	little	time	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
i	just	ca	n't	tell	you	--	there	's	one	thing	i	want	to	tell	you	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	,	you	know	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 week 	 s 	 	with	all	these	 act 	 ors 	 	,	 produce 	 rs 	 	,	and	the	 problem 	 s 	 	they	have	to	go	through	are	 un 	 imagin 	 able 	 	for	,	you	know	,	a	westerner	,	a	 film 	 maker 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	in	america	or	in	europe	.
but	 al 	 ways 	 	with	a	 s 	 mile 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	with	an	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	,	that	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.
werner	herzog	,	the	german	 film 	 maker 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	need	to	make	 movie 	 s 	 	like	you	need	oxygen	.	``
and	i	think	they	're	 breath 	 ing 	 	.
the	nigerian	 film 	 makers 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	like	.
and	so	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	for	them	,	and	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 audience 	 s 	 	.
a	woman	told	me	,	``	when	i	see	a	nollywood	film	,	i	can	relax	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	--	i	can	breathe	better	.	``
there	is	 al 	 so 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	that	i	hope	will	 reson 	 ate 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	audience	.
it	's	technology	.	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	it	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	the	digital	non	-	linear	 edit 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 lash 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	,	the	cost	now	is	a	fraction	of	what	it	used	to	be	.
 in 	 credible 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	cost	under	5,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 unleash 	 ed 	 	tremendous	energy	.
and	guess	what	?
we	did	n't	have	to	tell	to	the	nigerian	 film 	 makers 	 	.
they	 under 	 stood 	 	it	,	they	 embrace 	 d 	 	the	technology	and	they	run	with	it	,	and	they	're	 success 	 ful 	 	.
i	hope	that	the	nollywood	 phenomen 	 on 	 	will	go	both	ways	.
i	hope	it	will	inspire	other	african	 nation 	 s 	 	to	embrace	the	technology	,	look	at	the	nigerian	model	,	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 film 	 s 	 	,	create	 job 	 s 	 	,	create	a	narrative	for	the	population	,	 some 	 thing 	 	to	identify	,	 some 	 thing 	 	positive	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 psycho 	 logical 	 	relief	and	it	's	part	of	the	culture	.
but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	can	inspire	us	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	it	 go 	 es 	 	both	ways	.
 film 	 makers 	 	,	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	,	they	look	at	nollywood	and	they	say	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	do	,	and	make	a	buck	and	live	with	 th 	 is 	 	job	.	``
so	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	it	's	a	 less 	 on 	 	that	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	them	.
and	there	's	one	thing	,	one	small	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	i	have	for	you	,	and	should	make	us	reflect	on	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	theme	of	 th 	 is 	 	session	.
try	to	imagine	a	world	where	the	 on 	 ly 	 	goal	is	food	and	a	shelter	,	but	no	 st 	 ories 	 	.
no	 st 	 ories 	 	around	the	 camp 	 fire 	 	.
no	 legend 	 s 	 	,	no	 fairytale 	 s 	 	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	.
no	 novel 	 s 	 	.
difficult	,	eh	?	it	's	 meaning 	 less 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	.
i	think	that	the	key	to	a	 health 	 y 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	a	 thriv 	 ing 	 	community	of	 story 	 teller 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	that	the	nigerian	 film 	 makers 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 prov 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	would	like	you	to	hear	 the 	 ir 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	.
just	a	few	 moment 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	an	 add 	 ed 	 	sequence	,	just	some	 voice 	 s 	 	from	nollywood	.
toyin	alousa	:	nollywood	is	the	best	thing	that	can	happen	to	them	.
if	you	have	an	industry	that	 put 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 mile 	 	on	people	's	face	,	that	's	nollywood	.
so	:	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	,	we	're	not	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	have	better	 movie 	 s 	 	,	we	'll	have	that	original	nigerian	movie	.
be	:	it	's	still	the	same	 bas 	 ic 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	.
love	,	action	.
but	we	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	it	our	own	way	,	our	own	nigerian	way	,	african	way	.
we	have	 divers 	 e 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	,	 divers 	 e 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	,	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	,	that	in	the	natal	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	see	us	 exhaust 	 ing 	 	the	 st 	 ories 	 	we	have	.
fs	:	my	job	 end 	 s 	 	here	,	and	the	nollywood	 film 	 makers 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	have	now	to	work	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	that	there	will	be	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 collabor 	 ations 	 	,	where	we	teach	each	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	happen	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	stop	.	i	've	got	two	 question 	 s 	 	.

and	we	know	that	there	are	more	.
so	it	's	safe	to	say	that	there	are	2,000	 film 	 s 	 	.
so	imagine	45	 film 	 s 	 	per	week	.
there	are	 challeng 	 es 	 	.	there	are	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
there	is	a	glut	of	film	,	the	quality	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	raised	,	they	need	to	go	to	the	next	level	,	but	i	'm	 optimist 	 ic 	 	.
ca	:	and	these	are	n't	 film 	 s 	 	that	are	 prim 	 arily 	 	 s 	 een 	 	in	 cinema 	 s 	 	?
fs	:	oh	 y 	 es 	 	,	of	course	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	,	you	know	,	for	you	to	try	to	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	,	these	are	 film 	 s 	 	that	are	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	in	 market 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 b 	 ought 	 	in	video	 shop 	 s 	 	.
they	can	be	 rent 	 ed 	 	for	 penni 	 es 	 	.
ca	:	on	what	format	?
fs	:	oh	,	the	format	--	thank	you	for	the	question	.	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	vcds	.
it	's	a	cd	,	it	's	a	little	bit	more	 compress 	 ed 	 	image	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	with	vhs	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	n't	wait	for	,	you	know	,	the	 lat 	 est 	 	technology	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	in	'92	,	'94	.
so	there	are	57	million	vcrs	in	nigeria	that	play	,	you	know	,	vhs	and	these	vcds	.
it	's	a	cd	 bas 	 ically 	 	.	it	's	a	compact	 dis 	 c 	 	.
ca	:	so	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	are	film	 cast 	 s 	 	...	?
fs	:	you	can	be	in	a	lagos	traffic	jam	and	you	can	buy	a	movie	or	some	 banana 	 s 	 	or	some	water	.	 y 	 es 	 	.
and	i	have	to	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 prove 	 s 	 	that	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	a	 commodit 	 y 	 	,	it	's	a	staple	.
there	is	no	life	 with 	 out 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
ca	:	franco	,	thank	you	so	much	.
