how	do	you	feed	a	city	?
it	's	one	of	the	great	 question 	 s 	 	of	our	time	.
yet	it	's	one	that	's	 rare 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
we	take	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	that	if	we	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	shop	or	restaurant	,	or	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	theater	's	foyer	in	about	an	hour	's	time	,	there	is	going	to	be	food	there	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	us	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 magic 	 ally 	 	come	from	 some 	 where 	 	.
but	when	you	think	that	every	day	for	a	city	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	london	,	 en 	 ough 	 	food	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 produce 	 d 	 	,	 transport 	 ed 	 	,	 b 	 ought 	 	and	 s 	 old 	 	,	 cook 	 ed 	 	,	eaten	,	 dispos 	 ed 	 	of	,	and	that	 some 	 thing 	 	similar	 ha 	 s 	 	to	happen	every	day	for	every	city	on	earth	,	it	's	 remark 	 able 	 	that	cities	get	fed	at	all	.
we	live	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	're	the	most	natural	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	 forget 	 ting 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 animal 	 s 	 	and	that	we	need	to	eat	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	dependent	on	the	natural	world	 a 	 s 	 	our	ancient	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	more	of	us	move	 in 	 to 	 	cities	,	more	of	that	natural	world	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	like	the	one	 be 	 hind 	 	me	--	it	's	soybean	 field 	 s 	 	in	mato	grosso	in	brazil	--	in	order	to	feed	us	.
these	are	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	but	few	of	us	ever	get	to	see	them	.
and	 increasing 	 ly 	 	these	 land 	 scapes 	 	are	not	just	 feed 	 ing 	 	us	either	.
 a 	 s 	 	more	of	us	move	 in 	 to 	 	cities	,	more	of	us	are	eating	meat	,	so	that	a	third	of	the	annual	grain	crop	 global 	 ly 	 	now	 get 	 s 	 	fed	to	 animal 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	to	us	human	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	 give 	 n 	 	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	grain	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	ten	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	grain	--	to	feed	a	human	if	it	's	 pass 	 ed 	 	through	an	animal	first	,	that	's	not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	way	of	 feed 	 ing 	 	us	.
and	it	's	an	 escal 	 ating 	 	problem	too	.
by	2050	,	it	's	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	twice	the	number	of	us	are	going	to	be	living	in	cities	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	there	is	going	to	be	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	meat	and	 dai 	 ry 	 	 consum 	 ed 	 	.
so	meat	and	 urban 	 ism 	 	are	 ris 	 ing 	 	hand	in	hand	.
and	that	's	going	to	pose	an	enormous	problem	.
six	billion	 hung 	 ry 	 	 carnivore 	 s 	 	to	feed	,	by	2050	.
that	's	a	big	problem	.	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	if	we	carry	on	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	,	it	's	a	problem	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	able	to	solve	.
 nine 	 teen 	 	million	 hectare 	 s 	 	of	 rain 	 forest 	 	are	lost	every	year	to	create	new	 ar 	 able 	 	land	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	at	the	same	time	we	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	an	 equi 	 valent 	 	amount	of	 exist 	 ing 	 	 ar 	 able 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 al 	 in 	 ization 	 	and	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	.
we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	for	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	too	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	about	10	 calorie 	 s 	 	to	produce	every	calorie	of	food	that	we	 consum 	 e 	 	in	the	west	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	there	is	food	that	we	are	producing	at	great	cost	,	we	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	value	it	.
half	the	food	 produce 	 d 	 	in	the	usa	is	 current 	 ly 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	away	.
and	to	end	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	long	process	,	we	're	not	even	 man 	 aging 	 	to	feed	the	planet	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
a	billion	of	us	are	 obes 	 e 	 	,	while	a	further	billion	 starv 	 e 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	it	 make 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	sense	.
and	when	you	think	that	80	percent	of	global	trade	in	food	now	is	controlled	by	just	five	 multi 	 national 	 	 corporation 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	grim	picture	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	're	moving	 in 	 to 	 	cities	,	the	world	is	 al 	 so 	 	 em 	 bracing 	 	a	western	diet	.
and	if	we	look	to	the	future	,	it	's	an	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	diet	.
so	how	did	we	get	here	?
and	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	what	are	we	going	to	do	about	it	?
well	,	to	answer	the	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	question	first	,	about	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	would	say	,	is	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	process	in	the	ancient	near	east	,	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	 fertil 	 e 	 	 cr 	 escent 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	was	 cr 	 escent 	 	shaped	.
and	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	 fertil 	 e 	 	.
and	it	was	here	,	about	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	two	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 invent 	 ions 	 	,	 agricultur 	 e 	 	and	 urban 	 ism 	 	,	 happen 	 ed 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	in	the	same	place	and	at	the	same	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	no	accident	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	and	cities	are	bound	together	.	they	need	each	other	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 discover 	 y 	 	of	grain	by	our	ancient	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	for	the	first	time	that	 produce 	 d 	 	a	food	source	that	was	large	 en 	 ough 	 	and	 s 	 table 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	support	permanent	 settle 	 ments 	 	.
and	if	we	look	at	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 settle 	 ments 	 	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	we	see	they	 we 	 re 	 	compact	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	productive	farm	land	and	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	large	temple	 complex 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	at	ur	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	,	in	fact	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	 spiritual 	 ized 	 	,	central	food	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 center 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	the	 temple 	 s 	 	that	 organize 	 d 	 	the	harvest	,	 gather 	 ed 	 	in	the	grain	,	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	it	to	the	 god 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	the	grain	that	the	 god 	 s 	 	did	n't	eat	back	to	the	people	.
so	,	if	you	like	,	the	whole	spiritual	and	physical	life	of	these	cities	was	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	the	grain	and	the	harvest	that	 sustain 	 ed 	 	them	.
and	in	fact	,	that	's	true	of	every	ancient	city	.
but	of	course	not	all	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	that	small	.
 famous 	 ly 	 	,	rome	had	about	a	million	 citizen 	 s 	 	by	the	first	century	a.d	.
so	how	did	a	city	like	 th 	 is 	 	feed	 it 	 self 	 	?
the	answer	is	what	i	call	``	ancient	food	 mile 	 s 	 	.	``
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	rome	had	access	to	the	sea	,	which	made	it	possible	for	it	to	import	food	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	way	away	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	it	was	possible	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	ancient	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	transport	food	over	 road 	 s 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	rough	.
and	the	food	 obvious 	 ly 	 	went	off	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	rome	 effective 	 ly 	 	 wage 	 d 	 	war	on	 place 	 s 	 	like	carthage	and	egypt	just	to	get	 it 	 s 	 	 paw 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	grain	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	.
and	,	in	fact	,	you	could	say	that	the	expansion	of	the	empire	was	 re 	 ally 	 	sort	of	one	long	,	drawn	out	 militar 	 ized 	 	 shop 	 ping 	 	spree	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
in	fact	--	i	love	the	fact	,	i	just	have	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	rome	in	fact	used	to	import	 oyster 	 s 	 	from	london	,	at	one	stage	.	i	think	that	's	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
so	rome	shaped	 it 	 s 	 	 h 	 inter 	 land 	 	through	 it 	 s 	 	 appetit 	 e 	 	.
but	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	the	other	thing	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	pre	-	industrial	world	.
if	we	look	at	a	map	of	london	in	the	17th	century	,	we	can	see	that	 it 	 s 	 	grain	,	which	is	coming	in	from	the	thames	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	bottom	of	 th 	 is 	 	map	.
so	the	grain	 market 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	to	the	south	of	the	city	.
and	the	 road 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	up	from	them	to	cheapside	,	which	was	the	main	market	,	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	grain	 market 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	name	of	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 street 	 s 	 	,	bread	street	,	you	can	tell	what	was	going	on	there	300	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	the	same	of	course	was	true	for	fish	.
fish	was	,	of	course	,	coming	in	by	river	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	same	thing	.
and	of	course	billingsgate	,	 famous 	 ly 	 	,	was	london	's	fish	market	,	 oper 	 ating 	 	on	-	 s 	 ite 	 	here	 un 	 til 	 	the	mid	-	1980s	.
which	is	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	when	you	think	about	it	.
 every 	 body 	 	else	was	 wander 	 ing 	 	around	with	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	that	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 brick 	 s 	 	and	sort	of	 smell 	 y 	 	fish	 happen 	 ing 	 	down	on	the	port	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	thing	about	food	in	cities	:	once	 it 	 s 	 	 root 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	city	are	 establish 	 ed 	 	,	they	 ver 	 y 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	move	.
meat	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	story	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	 animal 	 s 	 	could	walk	 in 	 to 	 	the	city	.
so	much	of	london	's	meat	was	coming	from	the	 north 	 west 	 	,	from	scotland	and	wales	.
so	it	was	coming	in	,	and	 arriv 	 ing 	 	at	the	city	at	the	 north 	 west 	 	,	which	is	why	smithfield	,	london	's	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	meat	market	,	was	 locate 	 d 	 	up	there	.
 po 	 ul 	 try 	 	was	coming	in	from	east	anglia	and	so	on	,	to	the	 north 	 east 	 	.
i	feel	a	bit	like	a	weather	woman	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	 any 	 way 	 	,	and	so	the	 bird 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	in	with	 the 	 ir 	 	feet	 protect 	 ed 	 	with	little	canvas	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
and	then	when	they	hit	the	eastern	end	of	cheapside	,	that	's	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 old 	 	,	which	is	why	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 po 	 ul 	 try 	 	.
and	,	in	fact	,	if	you	look	at	the	map	of	any	city	built	before	the	industrial	age	,	you	can	trace	food	coming	in	to	it	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	how	it	was	 physical 	 ly 	 	shaped	by	food	,	both	by	 read 	 ing 	 	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	which	give	you	a	lot	of	 clue 	 s 	 	.
friday	street	,	in	a	previous	life	,	is	where	you	went	to	buy	your	fish	on	a	friday	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	you	have	to	imagine	it	full	of	food	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 street 	 s 	 	and	the	public	 space 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	food	was	 b 	 ought 	 	and	 s 	 old 	 	.
and	if	we	look	at	an	image	of	smithfield	in	1830	you	can	see	that	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	live	in	a	city	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	be	 un 	 aware 	 	of	where	your	food	came	from	.
in	fact	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	sunday	lunch	,	the	 chance 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	it	was	 mo 	 o 	 ing 	 	or	 ble 	 ating 	 	 out 	 side 	 	your	window	about	three	 day 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	 obvious 	 ly 	 	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	city	,	part	of	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	cycle	.
and	then	10	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	of	the	great	western	in	1840	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	some	of	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	train	 passenger 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pig 	 s 	 	and	sheep	.
so	all	of	a	sudden	,	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	market	.
they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 laughter 	 ed 	 	out	of	sight	and	mind	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	 country 	 side 	 	.
and	they	're	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	city	by	rail	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
to	start	off	with	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	possible	for	the	first	time	to	grow	cities	,	 re 	 ally 	 	any	 s 	 ize 	 	and	shape	,	in	any	place	.
cities	used	to	be	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	by	 geo 	 graphy 	 	;	they	used	to	have	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	food	through	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	physical	 mean 	 s 	 	.
all	of	a	sudden	they	are	 effective 	 ly 	 	 emancip 	 ated 	 	from	 geo 	 graphy 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	from	these	 map 	 s 	 	of	london	,	in	the	90	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	 train 	 s 	 	came	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	little	blob	that	was	 quit 	 e 	 	easy	to	feed	by	 animal 	 s 	 	coming	in	on	foot	,	and	so	on	,	to	a	large	 spl 	 urge 	 	,	that	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	feed	with	 any 	 body 	 	on	foot	,	either	 animal 	 s 	 	or	people	.
and	of	course	that	was	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.	after	the	 train 	 s 	 	came	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 mark 	 s 	 	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	process	.
it	's	the	final	 emancip 	 ation 	 	of	the	city	from	any	 ap 	 parent 	 	relationship	with	nature	at	all	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	city	that	's	 de 	 void 	 	of	smell	,	 de 	 void 	 	of	mess	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	 de 	 void 	 	of	people	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	would	have	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
in	fact	,	what	they	did	to	get	food	was	they	got	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	drove	to	a	box	 some 	 where 	 	on	the	 out 	 skirt 	 s 	 	,	came	back	with	a	week	's	worth	of	 shop 	 ping 	 	,	and	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	on	earth	to	do	with	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	moment	when	our	relationship	,	both	with	food	and	cities	,	 change 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
here	we	have	food	--	that	used	to	be	the	center	,	the	social	core	of	the	city	--	at	the	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	.
it	used	to	be	a	social	event	,	 buy 	 ing 	 	and	selling	food	.
now	it	's	 anonym 	 ous 	 	.
we	used	to	cook	;	now	we	just	add	water	,	or	a	little	bit	of	an	egg	if	you	're	making	a	cake	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
we	do	n't	smell	food	to	see	if	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	eat	.
we	just	read	the	back	of	a	label	on	a	 pack 	 et 	 	.
and	we	do	n't	value	food	.	we	do	n't	trust	it	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 trust 	 ing 	 	it	,	we	fear	it	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 valu 	 ing 	 	it	,	we	throw	it	away	.
one	of	the	great	 iron 	 ies 	 	of	modern	food	 system 	 s 	 	is	that	they	've	made	the	 ver 	 y 	 	thing	they	 promise 	 d 	 	to	make	 eas 	 ier 	 	much	 hard 	 er 	 	.
by	making	it	possible	to	build	cities	 any 	 where 	 	and	any	place	,	they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 distance 	 d 	 	us	from	our	most	 import 	 ant 	 	relationship	,	which	is	that	of	us	and	nature	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	they	've	made	us	dependent	on	 system 	 s 	 	that	 on 	 ly 	 	they	can	deliver	,	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	are	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
so	what	are	we	going	to	do	about	that	?
it	's	not	a	new	question	.
500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	it	's	what	thomas	more	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 front 	 is 	 piece 	 	of	his	book	``	utopia	.	``
and	it	was	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	semi	-	 in 	 dependent 	 	city	-	 state 	 s 	 	,	if	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 remote 	 ly 	 	familiar	,	a	day	's	walk	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	where	 every 	 one 	 	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	-	mad	,	and	grew	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	back	 garden 	 s 	 	,	and	ate	 commun 	 al 	 	 meal 	 s 	 	together	,	and	so	on	.
and	i	think	you	could	 argu 	 e 	 	that	food	is	a	fundamental	 order 	 ing 	 	principle	of	utopia	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	more	never	 frame 	 d 	 	it	that	way	.
and	here	is	 an 	 other 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	``	 utopia 	 n 	 	``	vision	,	that	of	ebenezer	howard	,	``	the	garden	city	.	``
same	idea	:	 s 	 eries 	 	of	semi	-	 in 	 dependent 	 	city	-	 state 	 s 	 	,	little	 blob 	 s 	 	of	 metro 	 politan 	 	stuff	with	 ar 	 able 	 	land	around	,	 join 	 ed 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	by	 rail 	 way 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	food	could	be	 s 	 aid 	 	to	be	the	 order 	 ing 	 	principle	of	his	vision	.
it	even	got	built	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	vision	that	howard	had	.
and	that	is	the	problem	with	these	 utopia 	 n 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	that	they	are	 utopia 	 n 	 	.
utopia	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	word	that	thomas	moore	used	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	.
it	was	a	kind	of	joke	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	got	a	double	 deriv 	 ation 	 	from	the	greek	.
it	can	either	mean	a	good	place	,	or	no	place	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	ideal	.	it	's	an	 imagin 	 ary 	 	thing	.	we	ca	n't	have	it	.
and	i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	conceptual	tool	for	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 ver 	 y 	 	deep	problem	of	human	dwelling	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	not	much	use	.
so	i	've	come	up	with	an	 alter 	 native 	 	,	which	is	sitopia	,	from	the	ancient	greek	,	``	 s 	 ito 	 s 	 	``	for	food	,	and	``	 topo 	 s 	 	``	for	place	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	live	in	sitopia	.
we	live	in	a	world	shaped	by	food	,	and	if	we	 real 	 ize 	 	that	,	we	can	use	food	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	--	a	conceptual	tool	,	design	tool	,	to	shape	the	world	 different 	 ly 	 	.
so	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	do	that	,	what	might	sitopia	look	like	?
well	i	think	it	 look 	 s 	 	a	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	have	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	slide	.	it	's	just	the	look	on	the	face	of	the	dog	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	it	's	food	at	the	center	of	life	,	at	the	center	of	family	life	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 celebr 	 ated 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	,	people	taking	time	for	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	food	should	be	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
but	you	ca	n't	have	 scene 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 less 	 	you	have	people	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
by	the	way	,	these	can	be	men	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
it	's	people	who	think	about	food	,	who	think	 a 	 head 	 	,	who	plan	,	who	can	 star 	 e 	 	at	a	pile	of	raw	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	them	.
we	need	these	people	.	we	're	part	of	a	network	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 with 	 out 	 	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	we	ca	n't	have	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
here	,	i	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	chose	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	a	man	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	 veget 	 able 	 	.
but	 network 	 s 	 	,	 market 	 s 	 	where	food	is	 be 	 ing 	 	grown	 local 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	common	.	it	's	fresh	.
it	's	part	of	the	social	life	of	the	city	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 with 	 out 	 	that	,	you	ca	n't	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	place	,	food	that	is	grown	 local 	 ly 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	is	part	of	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	and	is	not	just	a	zero	-	sum	 commodit 	 y 	 	off	in	some	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	hell	-	hole	.
 cow 	 s 	 	with	a	view	.
 s 	 team 	 ing 	 	 pile 	 s 	 	of	 hum 	 us 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	whole	thing	together	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	community	project	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	in	toronto	.
it	's	a	 green 	 house 	 	,	where	 kid 	 s 	 	get	told	all	about	food	and	growing	 the 	 ir 	 	own	food	.
here	is	a	plant	 call 	 ed 	 	kevin	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	a	plant	 belong 	 ing 	 	to	a	kid	 call 	 ed 	 	kevin	.	i	do	n't	know	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	that	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 connect 	 	us	with	nature	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
so	sitopia	,	for	me	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	way	of	 see 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 recogn 	 izing 	 	that	sitopia	 al 	 ready 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	in	little	 pocket 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
the	trick	is	to	join	them	up	,	to	use	food	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 see 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	we	do	that	,	we	're	going	to	stop	 see 	 ing 	 	cities	 a 	 s 	 	big	,	 metro 	 politan 	 	,	 un 	 productive 	 	 blob 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	're	going	to	see	them	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	productive	,	 organ 	 ic 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	of	which	they	are	 inevit 	 ably 	 	a	part	,	but	of	course	,	that	's	not	a	great	image	either	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	need	not	to	be	producing	food	like	 th 	 is 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
we	need	to	be	 think 	 ing 	 	more	about	 perma 	 culture 	 	,	which	is	why	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	image	just	 sum 	 s 	 	up	for	me	the	kind	of	 think 	 ing 	 	we	need	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	a	re	-	conceptualization	of	the	way	food	 shape 	 s 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
the	best	image	i	know	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	650	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	's	ambrogio	lorenzetti	's	``	 alle 	 gory 	 	of	good	government	.	``
it	's	about	the	relationship	between	the	city	and	the	 country 	 side 	 	.
and	i	think	the	 mess 	 age 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	.
if	the	city	 look 	 s 	 	after	the	country	,	the	country	will	look	after	the	city	.
and	i	want	us	to	ask	now	,	what	would	ambrogio	lorenzetti	paint	if	he	 paint 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	image	 to 	 day 	 	?
what	would	an	 alle 	 gory 	 	of	good	government	look	like	 to 	 day 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	's	an	 urge 	 nt 	 	question	.
it	's	one	we	have	to	ask	,	and	we	have	to	start	 answer 	 ing 	 	.
we	know	we	are	what	we	eat	.
we	need	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	the	world	is	 al 	 so 	 	what	we	eat	.
but	if	we	take	that	idea	,	we	can	use	food	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	to	shape	the	world	better	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
