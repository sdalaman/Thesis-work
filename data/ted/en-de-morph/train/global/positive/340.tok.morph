good	afternoon	,	good	 even 	 ing 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
we	can	go	,	 jam 	 bo 	 	,	 gut 	 en 	 	abend	,	 bon 	 s 	 oir 	 	,	but	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	.
that	is	the	call	that	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	make	before	they	go	to	sleep	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	.
you	hear	it	going	from	one	side	of	the	 val 	 ley 	 	to	the	other	,	from	one	group	of	 nest 	 s 	 	to	the	next	.
and	i	want	to	pick	up	with	my	talk	 th 	 is 	 	 even 	 ing 	 	from	where	zeray	left	off	 yester 	 day 	 	.
he	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	three	-	year	-	old	 australopithec 	 ine 	 	child	,	selam	.
and	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	the	family	tree	,	of	 man 	 kind 	 	through	dna	genetic	 pro 	 filing 	 	.
and	it	was	a	 paleonto 	 logist 	 	,	the	late	louis	leakey	,	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	set	me	on	the	path	for	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	way	back	then	.
it	's	kind	of	 common 	 place 	 	now	,	but	his	argument	was	--	 be 	 cause 	 	he	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 search 	 ing 	 	for	the	 fossil 	 ized 	 	 remain 	 s 	 	of	early	 human 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
and	you	can	tell	an	awful	lot	about	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	from	the	 fossil 	 s 	 	,	from	the	shape	of	the	muscle	 attach 	 ments 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	way	they	lived	from	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 artifact 	 s 	 	found	with	them	.
but	what	about	how	they	 behav 	 ed 	 	?	that	's	what	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	.
and	of	course	,	behavior	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 fossil 	 ize 	 	.
he	 argu 	 ed 	 	--	and	it	's	now	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	common	 theor 	 y 	 	--	that	if	we	found	behavior	 pattern 	 s 	 	similar	or	the	same	in	our	 close 	 st 	 	living	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	the	great	 ape 	 s 	 	,	and	 human 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	then	 may 	 be 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	present	in	the	ape	-	like	,	human	-	like	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	some	seven	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	had	 br 	 ought 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	with	us	from	that	ancient	,	ancient	past	.
well	,	if	you	look	in	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	deal	with	human	evolution	,	you	 ver 	 y 	 	often	find	people	 specul 	 ating 	 	about	how	early	 human 	 s 	 	may	have	 behav 	 ed 	 	,	based	on	the	behavior	of	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	.
they	are	more	like	us	than	any	other	living	creature	,	and	we	've	heard	about	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	.
so	it	 remain 	 s 	 	for	me	to	comment	on	the	ways	in	which	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	are	so	like	us	,	in	certain	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
every	chimpanzee	 ha 	 s 	 	his	or	her	own	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
of	course	,	i	 g 	 ave 	 	them	 name 	 s 	 	.	they	can	live	to	be	60	 year 	 s 	 	or	more	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	think	most	of	them	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	n't	make	it	to	60	in	the	wild	.
mr.	wurzel	.	the	female	 ha 	 s 	 	her	first	baby	when	she	's	11	or	12	.
 there 	 after 	 	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	one	baby	 on 	 ly 	 	every	five	or	six	 year 	 s 	 	,	a	long	period	of	 child 	 hood 	 	 depend 	 ency 	 	when	the	child	is	 nurs 	 ing 	 	,	 sleep 	 ing 	 	with	the	mother	at	night	,	and	 rid 	 ing 	 	on	her	back	.
and	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	long	period	of	 child 	 hood 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	for	us	,	in	relation	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	brain	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	ever	more	complex	 dur 	 ing 	 	evolution	in	different	 form 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	so	we	find	that	 learn 	 ing 	 	 play 	 s 	 	an	ever	more	 import 	 ant 	 	role	in	an	individual	's	life	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	young	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 watch 	 ing 	 	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 elder 	 s 	 	do	.
we	know	now	that	they	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 imit 	 ating 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	they	see	.
and	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	's	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	that	the	different	tool	-	using	 behavior 	 s 	 	--	that	have	now	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	in	all	the	different	chimpanzee	 population 	 s 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	in	africa	--	how	these	are	 pass 	 ed 	 	from	one	generation	to	the	next	,	through	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	 imit 	 ation 	 	and	practice	,	so	that	we	can	 de 	 scribe 	 	these	tool	-	using	 behavior 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	primitive	culture	.
 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	a	spoken	language	.	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	that	.
they	do	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	repertoire	of	 post 	 ures 	 	and	 gest 	 ures 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	which	are	similar	,	or	even	 ident 	 ical 	 	,	to	 our 	 s 	 	and	 form 	 ed 	 	in	the	same	 con 	 text 	 	.	 greet 	 ing 	 	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	 em 	 bracing 	 	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	kiss	,	hold	 hand 	 s 	 	,	pat	one	 an 	 other 	 	on	the	back	.
and	they	swagger	and	they	throw	 rock 	 s 	 	.
in	chimpanzee	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	we	find	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 pre 	 cursor 	 s 	 	to	love	and	true	 al 	 truism 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	they	,	like	us	,	have	a	dark	side	to	 the 	 ir 	 	nature	.
they	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 extrem 	 e 	 	 brutal 	 ity 	 	,	even	a	kind	of	primitive	war	.
and	these	 re 	 ally 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	for	the	most	part	,	are	 direct 	 ed 	 	against	 individual 	 s 	 	of	the	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	social	group	.
they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 territ 	 orial 	 ly 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	.
 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	more	than	any	other	living	creature	,	have	 help 	 ed 	 	us	to	understand	that	,	after	all	,	there	is	no	sharp	line	between	 human 	 s 	 	and	the	rest	of	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 blur 	 ry 	 	line	,	and	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	more	 blur 	 ry 	 	all	the	time	 a 	 s 	 	we	make	even	more	 observ 	 ations 	 	.
the	 stud 	 y 	 	that	i	 beg 	 an 	 	in	1960	is	still	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	.
and	these	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	living	 the 	 ir 	 	complex	social	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	wild	,	have	 help 	 ed 	 	--	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	else	--	to	make	us	 real 	 ize 	 	we	are	part	of	,	and	not	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	,	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	with	whom	we	share	the	planet	.
so	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	to	find	that	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	like	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	 creature 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	photograph	from	the	air	,	and	it	 show 	 s 	 	you	the	 forest 	 ed 	 	 high 	 land 	 s 	 	of	gombe	.
and	it	was	when	i	flew	over	the	whole	area	,	about	16	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 out 	 side 	 	the	park	,	 th 	 is 	 	forest	,	which	in	1960	had	 stretch 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 un 	 broken 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	eastern	shore	of	lake	tanganyika	,	which	is	where	the	 tin 	 y 	 	,	30	-	square	-	mile	gombe	national	park	lies	,	that	a	question	came	to	my	mind	.
``	how	can	we	even	try	to	 s 	 ave 	 	these	famous	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	when	the	people	living	around	the	national	park	are	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	?	``
more	people	are	living	there	than	the	land	could	possibly	support	.
the	 number 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	by	 refuge 	 es 	 	 pour 	 ing 	 	in	from	burundi	and	over	the	lake	from	congo	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	people	--	they	could	n't	afford	to	buy	food	from	 else 	 where 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	led	to	a	program	,	which	we	call	tacare	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 hol 	 istic 	 	way	of	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	the	people	living	in	the	 village 	 s 	 	around	the	park	.

there	is	n't	time	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	but	it	's	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	tree	 nurse 	 ries 	 	,	 method 	 s 	 	of	 farm 	 ing 	 	most	 suit 	 able 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	now	 ver 	 y 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	desert	-	like	land	up	in	these	 mountain 	 s 	 	.

 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	build	some	 school 	 rooms 	 	.
most	 import 	 ant 	 	of	all	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	is	 work 	 ing 	 	with	small	 group 	 s 	 	of	women	,	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	them	with	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	micro	-	credit	 loan 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	got	,	 a 	 s 	 	is	the	case	around	the	world	,	about	95	percent	of	all	 loan 	 s 	 	 return 	 ed 	 	.

we	provide	information	about	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	and	about	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	program	,	 some 	 thing 	 	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	for	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.
what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	for	 conserv 	 ation 	 	is	that	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	living	in	these	24	 village 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	looking	on	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	bunch	of	white	people	coming	to	 stud 	 y 	 	a	whole	bunch	of	 monkey 	 s 	 	--	and	by	the	way	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	staff	are	now	tanzanian	--	but	when	we	 beg 	 an 	 	the	tacare	program	,	it	was	a	tanzanian	team	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	 village 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	tanzanian	team	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	 village 	 rs 	 	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
 we 	 re 	 	they	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 conserv 	 ation 	 	?	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	health	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	education	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	time	went	on	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	improve	,	they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	understand	ever	more	about	the	need	for	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.
they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	understand	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	upper	 level 	 s 	 	of	the	 hill 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 de 	 nud 	 ed 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	,	so	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	and	 mud 	 slide 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	we	are	 develop 	 ing 	 	what	we	call	the	 great 	 er 	 	gombe	 eco 	 system 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	area	way	 out 	 side 	 	the	national	park	,	 stretch 	 ing 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	all	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	these	 village 	 s 	 	have	a	better	standard	of	life	,	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 agree 	 ing 	 	to	put	between	10	percent	and	20	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	land	in	the	 high 	 land 	 s 	 	 a 	 side 	 	,	so	that	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 tree 	 s 	 	grow	back	,	the	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	will	have	 leaf 	 y 	 	 corridor 	 s 	 	through	which	they	can	travel	to	interact	--	 a 	 s 	 	they	must	for	genetic	 vi 	 ability 	 	--	with	other	remnant	 group 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	national	park	.
so	tacare	is	a	success	.
we	're	 replica 	 ting 	 	it	in	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	africa	,	around	other	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	 area 	 s 	 	which	are	 face 	 d 	 	with	 extrem 	 e 	 	population	pressure	.

and	so	you	get	 desert 	 ification 	 	--	 creep 	 ing 	 	,	 creep 	 ing 	 	,	 creep 	 ing 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	the	last	of	the	 tree 	 s 	 	are	cut	down	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	is	not	just	in	africa	.	it	's	all	over	the	world	.
so	it	was	n't	surprising	to	me	that	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 travel 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	i	met	so	 man 	 y 	 	young	people	who	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	have	lost	hope	.
we	seem	to	have	lost	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	the	 indi 	 genous 	 	people	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	question	.	``	why	?	``
well	,	do	you	think	there	could	be	some	kind	of	 dis 	 connect 	 	between	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	clever	brain	,	the	kind	of	brain	that	the	ted	 techno 	 logies 	 	 exempl 	 ify 	 	,	and	the	human	heart	?	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	in	the	non	-	scientific	term	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	love	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	.	is	there	some	 dis 	 connect 	 	?
and	these	young	people	,	when	i	talk	to	them	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	either	 depress 	 ed 	 	or	 a 	 pathetic 	 	,	or	bitter	and	 ang 	 ry 	 	.	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	more	or	less	the	same	thing	,	``	we	feel	 th 	 is 	 	way	 be 	 cause 	 	we	feel	you	've	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	our	future	and	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	we	can	do	about	it	.	``
we	have	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	future	.
i	've	got	three	little	 grand 	 children 	 	,	and	every	time	i	look	at	them	and	i	think	how	we	've	 harm 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	planet	since	i	was	 the 	 ir 	 	age	,	i	feel	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	.
and	that	led	to	 th 	 is 	 	program	we	call	 root 	 s 	 	and	 shoot 	 s 	 	,	which	 beg 	 an 	 	right	here	in	tanzania	and	 ha 	 s 	 	now	spread	to	97	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	.
it	's	 symbol 	 ic 	 	.	 root 	 s 	 	make	a	firm	 found 	 ation 	 	.
 shoot 	 s 	 	seem	 tin 	 y 	 	;	to	reach	the	 s 	 un 	 	they	can	break	through	a	brick	wall	.
see	the	brick	wall	 a 	 s 	 	all	these	 problem 	 s 	 	we	've	 inflict 	 ed 	 	on	the	planet	,	 environment 	 al 	 	and	social	.	it	's	a	 mess 	 age 	 	of	hope	.
 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	young	people	around	the	world	can	break	through	and	can	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	better	world	for	all	living	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	of	 root 	 s 	 	and	 shoot 	 s 	 	:	every	single	one	of	us	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	every	single	day	.
we	have	a	choice	.	every	one	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	we	have	a	choice	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	kind	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	we	want	to	make	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	have	no	choice	.	it	's	up	to	us	to	change	 thing 	 s 	 	so	that	the	poor	have	choice	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	 root 	 s 	 	and	 shoot 	 s 	 	 group 	 s 	 	all	 choos 	 e 	 	three	 project 	 s 	 	.
it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	how	old	they	are	,	and	which	country	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	in	a	city	or	 r 	 ural 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	have	 program 	 s 	 	now	from	 pre 	 school 	 	right	through	university	,	with	more	and	more	 adult 	 s 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 root 	 s 	 	and	 shoot 	 s 	 	 group 	 s 	 	.
and	every	group	 choos 	 es 	 	,	between	them	,	three	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	project	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	better	world	,	 recogn 	 izing 	 	that	all	these	different	 problem 	 s 	 	are	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	and	 imp 	 ing 	 e 	 	on	each	other	.
so	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 project 	 s 	 	will	be	to	help	 the 	 ir 	 	own	human	community	.
and	then	,	if	they	're	able	,	they	may	raise	money	to	help	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 project 	 s 	 	will	be	to	help	 animal 	 s 	 	--	not	just	 wild 	 life 	 	,	domestic	 animal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 project 	 s 	 	will	be	to	help	the	environment	that	we	all	share	.
and	 wove 	 n 	 	 through 	 out 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 mess 	 age 	 	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	live	in	peace	and	 harmon 	 y 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	in	our	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	in	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	between	 nation 	 s 	 	,	between	 culture 	 s 	 	,	between	 relig 	 ions 	 	and	between	us	and	the	natural	world	.
we	need	the	natural	world	.	we	can	not	go	on	 destroy 	 ing 	 	it	at	the	rate	we	are	.
we	not	do	have	more	than	 th 	 is 	 	one	planet	.
just	 pick 	 ing 	 	one	or	two	of	the	 project 	 s 	 	right	here	in	africa	that	the	 root 	 s 	 	and	 shoot 	 s 	 	 group 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	one	or	two	 project 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	--	in	tanzania	,	in	uganda	,	kenya	,	south	africa	,	congo	-	brazzaville	,	sierra	leone	,	cameroon	and	other	 group 	 s 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	it	's	in	97	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	.
of	course	,	they	're	 plant 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	.	they	're	growing	 organ 	 ic 	 	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	 refuge 	 e 	 	 camp 	 s 	 	,	with	 chicken 	 s 	 	and	selling	the	 egg 	 s 	 	for	a	little	amount	of	money	,	or	just	using	them	to	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	a	sense	of	 pri 	 de 	 	and	 empower 	 ment 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	 help 	 less 	 	and	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	 other 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 chicken 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	used	in	uganda	to	give	some	 psycho 	 logical 	 	help	to	ex	-	child	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
 do 	 ing 	 	 project 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	out	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	're	 use 	 ful 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	program	in	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	,	there	's	no	time	for	more	 root 	 s 	 	and	 shoot 	 s 	 	now	.
but	--	oh	,	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	component	of	 root 	 s 	 	and	 shoot 	 s 	 	,	with	 old 	 er 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 young 	 er 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	 un 	 want 	 ed 	 	 pregn 	 ancies 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	which	young	people	listen	to	better	from	other	youth	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 adult 	 s 	 	.
hope	.	that	's	the	question	i	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	around	the	world	:	``	jane	,	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	your	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	in	number	from	about	one	million	,	at	the	turn	of	the	century	,	to	no	more	than	150,000	now	,	and	the	same	with	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 forest 	 s 	 	 disappear 	 ing 	 	,	 desert 	 s 	 	where	once	there	was	forest	.
do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	hope	?	``	well	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
you	ca	n't	come	to	a	 con 	 ference 	 	like	ted	and	not	have	hope	,	can	you	?
and	of	course	,	there	's	hope	.	one	is	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	human	brain	.
and	i	mean	,	think	of	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
and	i	've	just	 be 	 en 	 	so	 thrill 	 ed 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	to	come	to	people	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 com 	 post 	 	 latrine 	 s 	 	.
it	's	one	of	my	 hobby 	 horse 	 s 	 	.
we	just	flush	all	 th 	 is 	 	water	down	the	 lav 	 atory 	 	,	it	's	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
and	then	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	--	 desperate 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
do	we	care	about	the	planet	for	our	children	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	have	children	or	 grand 	 children 	 	,	 niece 	 s 	 	,	 nephew 	 s 	 	?
do	we	care	about	 the 	 ir 	 	future	?
and	if	we	care	about	 the 	 ir 	 	future	,	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	elite	around	the	world	,	we	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.	we	can	make	 choice 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	we	live	each	day	.
what	we	buy	.	what	we	wear	.
and	 choos 	 e 	 	to	make	these	 choice 	 s 	 	with	the	question	,	how	will	 th 	 is 	 	affect	the	environment	around	me	?
how	will	it	affect	the	life	of	my	child	when	he	or	she	 grow 	 s 	 	up	?
or	my	 grand 	 child 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
so	the	human	brain	,	 couple 	 d 	 	with	the	human	heart	,	and	we	join	 hand 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
and	that	's	what	ted	is	 help 	 ing 	 	so	well	with	,	and	google	who	help	us	,	and	esri	are	 help 	 ing 	 	us	with	mapping	in	gombe	national	park	.
all	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	we	can	use	.
now	let	's	link	them	,	and	it	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	happen	,	is	n't	it	?
you	've	heard	about	it	 th 	 is 	 	afternoon	.	it	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	happen	.
 th 	 is 	 	change	,	 th 	 is 	 	change	.	to	see	change	that	we	must	have	if	we	care	about	the	future	.
and	the	next	reason	for	hope	--	nature	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 resili 	 ent 	 	.
you	can	take	an	area	that	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	,	with	time	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	help	it	can	 re 	 generate 	 	.
and	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	the	tacare	program	.
i	told	you	,	where	a	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	dead	tree	stump	--	if	you	stop	 hack 	 ing 	 	them	for	 fire 	 wood 	 	,	which	you	do	n't	need	to	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	wood	 lot 	 s 	 	,	then	in	five	 year 	 s 	 	you	can	have	a	30	-	foot	tree	.
and	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	on	the	 br 	 ink 	 	of	 extinct 	 ion 	 	,	can	be	 give 	 n 	 	a	second	chance	.	that	's	my	next	book	.
it	's	inspiring	.	and	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	my	last	 categor 	 y 	 	of	hope	,	and	we	've	heard	about	 th 	 is 	 	so	much	in	the	last	two	 day 	 s 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 dom 	 it 	 able 	 	human	spirit	.	 th 	 is 	 	 determi 	 nation 	 	of	people	,	the	 resili 	 ence 	 	of	the	human	spirit	,	so	that	people	who	you	would	think	would	be	 batt 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	poverty	,	or	disease	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	can	pull	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	out	of	it	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	with	a	 help 	 ing 	 	hand	,	and	take	 the 	 ir 	 	part	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	and	take	 the 	 ir 	 	part	in	changing	the	world	.
and	just	to	think	of	one	or	two	people	out	of	africa	who	are	just	 re 	 ally 	 	inspiring	.
we	could	make	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	list	,	but	 obvious 	 ly 	 	nelson	mandela	,	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	17	 year 	 s 	 	of	hard	physical	labor	,	23	 year 	 s 	 	of	 imprison 	 ment 	 	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	ability	to	forgive	,	so	that	he	could	lead	his	nation	out	the	 e 	 vil 	 	regime	of	apartheid	 with 	 out 	 	a	 blood 	 bath 	 	.
ken	saro	-	wiwa	,	in	nigeria	,	who	took	on	the	giant	oil	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	people	around	the	world	 tri 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	best	,	was	 execute 	 d 	 	.
people	like	 th 	 is 	 	are	so	 inspiration 	 al 	 	.
people	like	 th 	 is 	 	are	the	role	 model 	 s 	 	we	need	for	young	africans	.
and	we	need	some	 environment 	 al 	 	role	 model 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	some	of	them	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	with	 every 	 one 	 	at	ted	.
and	i	hope	that	some	of	us	can	get	together	and	talk	about	some	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	 root 	 s 	 	and	 shoot 	 s 	 	program	.
and	just	a	last	word	on	that	--	the	young	woman	who	's	running	 th 	 is 	 	entire	 con 	 ference 	 	center	,	i	met	her	 to 	 day 	 	.
she	came	up	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	with	her	certificate	.	she	was	[	in	]	 root 	 s 	 	and	 shoot 	 s 	 	.
she	was	in	the	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	in	dar	es	salaam	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	it	's	 help 	 ed 	 	her	to	do	what	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	for	me	to	meet	her	and	see	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	young	people	,	when	they	are	 empower 	 ed 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	take	action	,	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	are	our	hope	for	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
