good	afternoon	.
there	's	a	medical	revolution	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	around	us	,	and	it	's	one	that	's	going	to	help	us	conquer	some	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	's	most	 dread 	 ed 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	cancer	.
the	revolution	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	,	and	it	's	based	on	the	process	that	our	bodies	use	to	grow	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
so	why	should	we	care	about	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	?
well	,	the	human	body	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	 pack 	 ed 	 	with	them	:	60,000	 mile 	 s 	 	worth	in	a	typical	adult	.
end	to	end	,	that	would	form	a	line	that	would	circle	the	earth	twice	.
the	 small 	 est 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 cap 	 ill 	 aries 	 	;	we	've	got	19	billion	of	them	in	our	bodies	.
and	these	are	the	 vessel 	 s 	 	of	life	,	and	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	'll	show	you	,	they	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	the	 vessel 	 s 	 	of	death	.
now	the	 remark 	 able 	 	thing	about	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	is	that	they	have	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	adapt	to	 what 	 ever 	 	environment	they	're	growing	in	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	liver	they	form	 channel 	 s 	 	to	 detox 	 ify 	 	the	blood	;	in	the	lung	they	line	air	 sac 	 s 	 	for	gas	 ex 	 change 	 	;	in	muscle	they	 cork 	 screw 	 	so	that	 muscle 	 s 	 	can	contract	 with 	 out 	 	cutting	off	 circul 	 ation 	 	;	and	in	 nerve 	 s 	 	they	course	 a 	 long 	 	like	power	lines	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 nerve 	 s 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
we	get	most	of	these	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	when	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	still	in	the	womb	,	and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	do	n't	 normal 	 ly 	 	grow	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	in	a	few	special	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	:	in	women	,	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	grow	every	month	to	build	the	lining	of	the	uterus	;	 dur 	 ing 	 	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	,	they	form	the	 place 	 nta 	 	,	which	 connect 	 s 	 	mom	and	baby	.
and	after	 in 	 jury 	 	,	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	grow	under	the	 s 	 cab 	 	in	order	to	heal	a	wound	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	all	growing	 to 	 ward 	 	the	center	of	the	wound	.
so	the	body	 ha 	 s 	 	the	ability	to	 regulat 	 e 	 	the	amount	of	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	that	are	present	at	any	 give 	 n 	 	time	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	through	an	elaborate	and	elegant	system	of	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	,	 stimul 	 ators 	 	and	 inhibit 	 ors 	 	of	 angio 	 genesis 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	,	when	we	need	a	brief	burst	of	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	,	the	body	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	by	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	 stimul 	 ators 	 	,	 protein 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 angio 	 genic 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	that	act	 a 	 s 	 	natural	 fertil 	 izer 	 	and	 stimul 	 ate 	 	new	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	to	sprout	.
and	when	 t 	 hose 	 	excess	 vessel 	 s 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	,	the	body	 prune 	 s 	 	them	back	to	 base 	 line 	 	using	 natural 	 ly 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	 inhibit 	 ors 	 	of	 angio 	 genesis 	 	.
now	there	are	other	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	we	start	 be 	 neath 	 	the	 base 	 line 	 	and	we	need	to	grow	more	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	just	to	get	back	to	normal	 level 	 s 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	after	an	 in 	 jury 	 	--	and	a	body	can	do	that	too	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	to	that	normal	level	,	that	set	point	.
but	what	we	now	know	is	that	for	a	number	of	 disease 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 defect 	 s 	 	in	the	system	where	the	body	ca	n't	prune	back	extra	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	or	ca	n't	grow	 en 	 ough 	 	new	 one 	 s 	 	in	the	right	place	at	the	right	time	.
and	in	these	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	 angio 	 genesis 	 	is	out	of	balance	.
and	when	 angio 	 genesis 	 	is	out	of	balance	,	a	myriad	of	 disease 	 s 	 	result	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 in 	 sufficient 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	--	not	 en 	 ough 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	--	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 wound 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	heal	,	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	,	 leg 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 circul 	 ation 	 	,	death	from	stroke	,	nerve	damage	.
and	on	the	other	end	,	 excess 	 ive 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	--	too	 man 	 y 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	--	 drive 	 s 	 	disease	,	and	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	cancer	,	 blind 	 ness 	 	,	 art 	 hritis 	 	,	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	alzheimer	's	disease	.
in	total	,	there	are	more	than	70	major	 disease 	 s 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	more	than	a	billion	people	 world 	 wide 	 	,	that	all	look	on	the	surface	to	be	different	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	but	all	 actual 	 ly 	 	share	 ab 	 normal 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	common	 denomi 	 nator 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 real 	 ization 	 	is	 allow 	 ing 	 	us	to	 re 	 conceptual 	 ize 	 	the	way	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	approach	these	 disease 	 s 	 	by	 controll 	 ing 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	.
now	i	'm	going	to	focus	on	cancer	 be 	 cause 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	is	a	 hall 	 mark 	 	of	cancer	,	every	type	of	cancer	.
so	here	we	go	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tumor	:	dark	,	gray	,	ominous	mass	growing	 in 	 side 	 	a	brain	.
and	under	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	you	can	see	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	these	 brow 	 n 	 	 stain 	 ing 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	,	 cap 	 ill 	 aries 	 	that	are	 feed 	 ing 	 	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	oxygen	and	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
but	 cancer 	 s 	 	do	n't	start	out	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	,	in	fact	,	 cancer 	 s 	 	do	n't	start	out	with	a	blood	supply	.
they	start	out	 a 	 s 	 	small	,	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 nest 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	that	can	 on 	 ly 	 	grow	to	one	half	a	cubic	millimeter	in	 s 	 ize 	 	;	that	's	the	tip	of	a	 ball 	 point 	 	pen	.
then	they	ca	n't	get	any	 large 	 r 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	a	blood	supply	,	so	they	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	oxygen	or	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	these	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	all	the	time	in	our	body	.
 au 	 topsy 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	from	people	who	 di 	 ed 	 	in	car	 accident 	 s 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	about	40	percent	of	women	between	the	 age 	 s 	 	of	40	and	50	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 breast 	 s 	 	,	about	50	percent	of	men	in	 the 	 ir 	 	50s	and	60s	have	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 pro 	 state 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	,	and	 virtual 	 ly 	 	100	percent	of	us	,	by	the	time	we	reach	our	70s	,	will	have	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	growing	in	our	 thy 	 roid 	 	.
yet	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	blood	supply	,	most	of	these	 cancer 	 s 	 	will	never	 be 	 come 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
dr.	judah	folkman	,	who	was	my	mentor	and	who	was	the	pioneer	of	the	 angio 	 genesis 	 	field	,	once	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	``	cancer	 with 	 out 	 	disease	.	``
so	the	body	's	ability	to	balance	 angio 	 genesis 	 	,	when	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	,	 prevent 	 s 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	from	 feed 	 ing 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	one	of	our	most	 import 	 ant 	 	defense	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	against	cancer	.
in	fact	,	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	block	 angio 	 genesis 	 	and	prevent	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	from	ever	 reach 	 ing 	 	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 tumor 	 s 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	ca	n't	grow	up	.
but	once	 angio 	 genesis 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	,	 cancer 	 s 	 	can	grow	 exponential 	 ly 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	how	a	cancer	 go 	 es 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 harm 	 less 	 	to	 dead 	 ly 	 	.
cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	 mut 	 ate 	 	and	they	gain	the	ability	to	 re 	 lease 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 angio 	 genic 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	,	natural	 fertil 	 izer 	 	,	that	tip	the	balance	in	favor	of	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	 invad 	 ing 	 	the	cancer	.
and	once	 t 	 hose 	 	 vessel 	 s 	 	 invad 	 e 	 	the	cancer	,	it	can	expand	,	it	can	 invad 	 e 	 	local	 tissue 	 s 	 	.
and	the	same	 vessel 	 s 	 	that	are	 feed 	 ing 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	allow	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	to	exit	 in 	 to 	 	the	 circul 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 metasta 	 s 	 es 	 	.
and	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	late	stage	of	cancer	is	the	one	at	which	it	's	most	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	,	when	 angio 	 genesis 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	and	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	are	growing	like	wild	.
so	,	if	 angio 	 genesis 	 	is	a	 tip 	 ping 	 	point	between	a	 harm 	 less 	 	cancer	and	a	 harm 	 ful 	 	one	,	then	one	major	part	of	the	 angio 	 genesis 	 	revolution	is	a	new	approach	to	 treat 	 ing 	 	cancer	by	cutting	off	the	blood	supply	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	therapy	,	and	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	from	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 select 	 ively 	 	 aim 	 s 	 	at	the	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	that	are	 feed 	 ing 	 	the	 cancer 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	tumor	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 like 	 	normal	,	 health 	 y 	 	 vessel 	 s 	 	we	see	in	other	 place 	 s 	 	of	the	body	:	they	're	 ab 	 normal 	 	;	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 poor 	 ly 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	;	and	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	 treat 	 ments 	 	that	target	them	.
in	effect	,	when	we	give	cancer	 patient 	 s 	 	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	therapy	--	here	,	an	 experiment 	 al 	 	drug	for	a	glioma	,	which	is	a	type	of	brain	tumor	--	you	can	see	that	there	are	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 change 	 s 	 	that	occur	when	the	tumor	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 starv 	 ed 	 	.
here	's	a	woman	with	a	breast	cancer	 be 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	the	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	avastin	,	which	is	fda	approved	.
and	you	can	see	that	the	halo	of	blood	flow	 disappear 	 s 	 	after	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
well	,	i	've	just	 show 	 n 	 	you	two	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	cancer	that	both	 respond 	 ed 	 	to	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	therapy	.
so	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	can	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	one	step	further	and	treat	other	 cancer 	 s 	 	,	even	in	other	species	?	``
so	here	is	a	nine	year	-	old	 box 	 er 	 	named	milo	who	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	tumor	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 malign 	 ant 	 	 neuro 	 fibro 	 ma 	 	growing	on	his	shoulder	.
it	 invad 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	 lung 	 s 	 	.
his	 veterin 	 arian 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	him	three	 month 	 s 	 	to	live	.
so	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	 cock 	 tail 	 	of	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	that	could	be	 mix 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	dog	food	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	an	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	cream	that	could	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	on	the	surface	of	the	tumor	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	of	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	that	cancer	's	growth	 s 	 uch 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	able	to	extend	milo	's	 surviv 	 al 	 	to	six	 time 	 s 	 	what	the	 veterin 	 arian 	 	had	 initi 	 ally 	 	 predict 	 ed 	 	,	all	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	quality	of	life	.
and	we	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	more	than	600	 dog 	 s 	 	.
we	have	about	a	60	percent	 respons 	 e 	 	rate	and	 improv 	 ed 	 	 surviv 	 al 	 	for	these	 pet 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	about	to	be	 euthanize 	 d 	 	.
so	let	me	show	you	a	couple	of	even	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	20	-	year	-	old	dolphin	living	in	florida	,	and	she	had	these	 les 	 ions 	 	in	her	mouth	that	,	over	the	course	of	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	 develop 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	invasive	 squam 	 ous 	 	cell	 cancer 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 create 	 d 	 	an	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	paste	.
we	had	it	 paint 	 ed 	 	on	top	of	the	cancer	three	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	.
and	over	the	course	of	seven	 month 	 s 	 	,	the	 cancer 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	 bio 	 psies 	 	came	back	 a 	 s 	 	normal	.
here	's	a	cancer	growing	on	the	lip	of	a	wuarter	horse	named	guinness	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 dead 	 ly 	 	type	of	cancer	 call 	 ed 	 	an	 angio 	 sarcoma 	 	.
it	had	 al 	 ready 	 	spread	to	his	lymph	 nod 	 es 	 	,	so	we	used	an	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	skin	cream	for	the	lip	and	an	 or 	 al 	 	 cock 	 tail 	 	,	so	we	could	treat	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	over	the	course	of	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	he	 experience 	 d 	 	a	complete	 re 	 mission 	 	.
and	here	he	is	six	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	guinness	,	with	his	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	owner	.
now	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	therapy	could	be	used	for	a	wide	range	of	 cancer 	 s 	 	.
and	,	in	fact	,	the	first	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ments 	 	for	people	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	,	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
there	's	12	different	 drug 	 s 	 	,	11	different	cancer	 type 	 s 	 	.
but	the	real	question	is	:	how	well	do	these	work	in	practice	?
so	here	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	patient	 surviv 	 al 	 	data	from	eight	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	cancer	.
the	 bar 	 s 	 	represent	 surviv 	 al 	 	time	taken	from	the	era	in	which	there	was	 on 	 ly 	 	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	,	or	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	or	 radi 	 ation 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
but	 start 	 ing 	 	in	2004	,	when	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	first	 be 	 came 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	well	you	can	see	that	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	70	to	100	percent	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	 surviv 	 al 	 	for	people	with	 kid 	 ney 	 	cancer	,	 multi 	 ple 	 	 myel 	 oma 	 	,	 color 	 ect 	 al 	 	cancer	,	and	 g 	 astro 	 intestinal 	 	 stro 	 mal 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 impress 	 ive 	 	.
but	for	other	 tumor 	 s 	 	and	cancer	 type 	 s 	 	,	the	 improve 	 ments 	 	have	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	modest	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	why	have	n't	we	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	better	?	``
and	the	answer	,	to	me	,	is	obvious	;	we	're	 treat 	 ing 	 	cancer	too	late	in	the	game	,	when	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 establish 	 ed 	 	and	,	 often 	 time 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	spread	or	 metasta 	 sized 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	doctor	,	i	know	that	once	a	disease	 progress 	 es 	 	to	an	 advance 	 d 	 	stage	,	 achiev 	 ing 	 	a	cure	can	be	difficult	,	if	not	 im 	 possible 	 	.
so	i	went	back	to	the	biology	of	 angio 	 genesis 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	:	could	the	answer	to	cancer	be	 prevent 	 ing 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	,	 beat 	 ing 	 	cancer	at	 it 	 s 	 	own	game	so	the	 cancer 	 s 	 	could	never	 be 	 come 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	could	help	 health 	 y 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	people	who	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	cancer	once	or	twice	and	want	to	find	a	way	to	keep	it	from	coming	back	.
so	to	look	for	a	way	to	prevent	 angio 	 genesis 	 	in	cancer	,	i	went	back	to	look	at	cancer	's	 cause 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	me	was	when	i	saw	that	diet	 account 	 s 	 	for	30	to	35	percent	of	 environment 	 ally 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	obvious	thing	is	to	think	about	what	we	could	 re 	 move 	 	from	our	diet	,	what	to	strip	out	,	take	away	.
but	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	approach	and	 beg 	 an 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	:	what	could	we	be	 add 	 ing 	 	to	our	diet	that	's	 natural 	 ly 	 	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	,	that	could	boost	the	body	's	defense	system	and	beat	back	 t 	 hose 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	that	are	 feed 	 ing 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	?
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	can	we	eat	to	 starv 	 e 	 	cancer	?
well	,	the	answer	's	 y 	 es 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	how	.
our	search	for	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	us	to	the	market	,	the	farm	and	to	the	spice	cabinet	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	that	mother	nature	 ha 	 s 	 	 lace 	 d 	 	a	large	number	of	 food 	 s 	 	and	 beverage 	 s 	 	and	 herb 	 s 	 	with	 natural 	 ly 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	 inhibit 	 ors 	 	of	 angio 	 genesis 	 	.
so	here	's	a	test	system	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
at	the	center	is	a	ring	from	which	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	are	growing	out	in	a	 star 	 burst 	 	fashion	.
and	we	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	system	to	test	 diet 	 ary 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	at	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	that	are	 obtain 	 able 	 	by	eating	.
so	let	me	show	you	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	put	in	an	 ex 	 tract 	 	from	red	 grape 	 s 	 	.
the	active	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	's	resveratrol	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	found	in	red	wine	.
 th 	 is 	 	 inhibit 	 s 	 	 ab 	 normal 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	by	60	percent	.
here	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	 add 	 ed 	 	an	 ex 	 tract 	 	from	 straw 	 berries 	 	;	it	 potent 	 ly 	 	 inhibit 	 s 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	.
and	 ex 	 tract 	 	from	 soybean 	 s 	 	.
and	here	is	a	growing	list	of	our	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	 food 	 s 	 	and	 beverage 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	.
for	each	food	type	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	are	different	 pot 	 encies 	 	 with 	 in 	 	different	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	and	 varie 	 tal 	 s 	 	.
and	we	want	to	measure	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	well	,	while	you	're	eating	a	 straw 	 berry 	 	or	 drink 	 ing 	 	tea	,	why	not	select	the	one	that	's	most	potent	for	 prevent 	 ing 	 	cancer	.
so	here	are	four	different	teas	that	we	've	tested	.
they	're	all	common	 one 	 s 	 	:	chinese	 ja 	 s 	 mine 	 	,	japanese	 s 	 en 	 cha 	 	,	earl	 gr 	 ey 	 	and	a	special	blend	that	we	prepared	.
and	you	can	see	 clear 	 ly 	 	that	the	teas	vary	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 pot 	 ency 	 	from	less	potent	to	more	potent	.
but	what	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	is	when	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	the	two	less	potent	teas	together	,	the	combination	,	the	blend	,	is	more	potent	than	either	one	 al 	 one 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	there	's	food	 syn 	 er 	 gy 	 	.
here	's	some	more	data	from	our	 test 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	in	the	lab	,	we	can	 simul 	 ate 	 	tumor	 angio 	 genesis 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	in	a	black	bar	.
and	using	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	we	can	test	the	 pot 	 ency 	 	of	cancer	 drug 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 short 	 er 	 	the	bar	,	less	 angio 	 genesis 	 	,	that	's	good	.
and	here	are	some	common	 drug 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	risk	of	cancer	in	people	.
 stat 	 in 	 s 	 	,	 non 	 steroid 	 al 	 	anti	-	 inflamm 	 atory 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	and	a	few	 other 	 s 	 	,	they	inhibit	 angio 	 genesis 	 	too	.
and	here	are	the	 diet 	 ary 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	going	head	to	head	against	these	 drug 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	,	they	 clear 	 ly 	 	hold	 the 	 ir 	 	own	and	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	they	're	more	potent	than	the	actual	 drug 	 s 	 	.
 so 	 y 	 	,	 par 	 s 	 ley 	 	,	 gar 	 lic 	 	,	 grape 	 s 	 	,	berries	;	i	could	go	home	and	cook	a	tasty	meal	using	these	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
so	imagine	if	we	could	create	the	world	's	first	rating	system	in	which	we	could	score	 food 	 s 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	,	cancer	-	 prevent 	 ative 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	right	now	.
now	,	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	a	bunch	of	lab	data	,	and	so	the	real	question	is	:	what	is	the	evidence	in	people	that	eating	certain	 food 	 s 	 	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	in	cancer	?
well	,	the	best	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	know	is	a	 stud 	 y 	 	of	79,000	men	 follow 	 ed 	 	over	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	which	it	was	found	that	men	who	 consum 	 ed 	 	 cook 	 ed 	 	 tomato 	 es 	 	two	to	three	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	had	up	to	a	50	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	risk	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	.
now	,	we	know	that	 tomato 	 es 	 	are	a	good	source	of	 ly 	 cope 	 ne 	 	,	and	 ly 	 cope 	 ne 	 	is	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	.
but	what	's	even	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	is	that	in	 t 	 hose 	 	men	who	did	develop	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	,	 t 	 hose 	 	who	ate	more	 serv 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	tomato	sauce	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 few 	 er 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	 feed 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	cancer	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	human	 stud 	 y 	 	is	a	prime	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 s 	 	present	in	food	and	 consum 	 ed 	 	at	practical	 level 	 s 	 	can	impact	on	cancer	.
and	we	're	now	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	role	of	a	 health 	 y 	 	diet	with	dean	ornish	at	ucsf	and	tufts	university	on	the	role	of	 th 	 is 	 	 health 	 y 	 	diet	on	 marker 	 s 	 	of	 angio 	 genesis 	 	that	we	can	find	in	the	 blood 	 stream 	 	.
now	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	what	i	've	 share 	 d 	 	with	you	 ha 	 s 	 	some	far	-	ranging	 implic 	 ations 	 	,	even	beyond	cancer	research	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	're	right	,	it	could	impact	on	consumer	education	,	food	 service 	 s 	 	,	public	health	and	even	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	industry	.
and	,	in	fact	,	some	 insur 	 ance 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	think	 a 	 long 	 	these	lines	.
check	out	 th 	 is 	 	ad	from	blue	cross	blue	shield	of	minnesota	.
and	for	 man 	 y 	 	people	around	the	world	,	 diet 	 ary 	 	cancer	 prevent 	 ion 	 	may	be	the	 on 	 ly 	 	practical	solution	 be 	 cause 	 	not	 every 	 body 	 	can	afford	expensive	end	-	stage	cancer	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	but	 every 	 body 	 	could	benefit	from	a	 health 	 y 	 	diet	based	on	local	,	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	you	about	food	,	and	i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	you	about	cancer	,	so	there	's	just	one	more	disease	that	i	have	to	tell	you	about	and	that	's	 obes 	 ity 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	adipose	tissue	,	fat	,	is	 high 	 ly 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	dependent	.
and	,	like	a	tumor	,	fat	 grow 	 s 	 	when	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	grow	.
so	the	question	is	:	can	we	shrink	fat	by	cutting	off	 it 	 s 	 	blood	supply	?
so	the	top	 curv 	 e 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	body	weight	of	a	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 obes 	 e 	 	mouse	that	eats	 non 	 stop 	 	 un 	 til 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	fat	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	 fur 	 ry 	 	tennis	ball	.
and	the	bottom	 curv 	 e 	 	is	the	weight	of	a	normal	mouse	.
if	you	take	the	 obes 	 e 	 	mouse	and	give	it	an	 angio 	 genesis 	 	 inhibit 	 or 	 	,	it	 lose 	 s 	 	weight	.
stop	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	 gain 	 s 	 	the	weight	back	.
 re 	 start 	 	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	 lose 	 s 	 	the	weight	 aga 	 in 	 	.
stop	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	it	 gain 	 s 	 	the	weight	back	.
and	,	in	fact	,	you	can	cycle	the	weight	up	and	down	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	 inhibit 	 ing 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	approach	that	we	're	taking	for	cancer	 prevent 	 ion 	 	may	 al 	 so 	 	have	an	application	for	 obes 	 ity 	 	.
the	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	we	ca	n't	take	these	 obes 	 e 	 	 mic 	 e 	 	and	make	them	lose	more	weight	than	what	the	normal	mouse	's	weight	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	ca	n't	create	 super 	 model 	 	 mic 	 e 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 speak 	 s 	 	to	the	role	of	 angio 	 genesis 	 	in	 regulat 	 ing 	 	 health 	 y 	 	set	 point 	 s 	 	.
albert	szent	-	gyorgi	once	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	 discover 	 y 	 	 consist 	 s 	 	of	 see 	 ing 	 	what	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	 think 	 ing 	 	what	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	thought	.	``
i	hope	i	've	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	you	that	,	for	 disease 	 s 	 	like	cancer	,	 obes 	 ity 	 	and	other	 condition 	 s 	 	,	that	there	may	be	a	great	power	in	 attack 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	common	 denomi 	 nator 	 	:	 angio 	 genesis 	 	.
and	that	's	what	i	think	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	.	thank	you	.
june	cohen	:	i	have	a	quick	question	for	you	.	so	these	 drug 	 s 	 	are	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	...
they	're	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	in	 main 	 stream 	 	cancer	 treat 	 ments 	 	right	now	.
for	 any 	 one 	 	out	here	who	 ha 	 s 	 	cancer	,	what	would	you	recommend	?
do	you	recommend	 pur 	 suing 	 	these	 treat 	 ments 	 	now	,	for	most	cancer	 patient 	 s 	 	?
william	li	:	so	there	are	 anti 	 angio 	 genic 	 	 treat 	 ments 	 	that	are	fda	approved	,	and	if	you	're	a	cancer	patient	or	 work 	 ing 	 	for	one	or	 advoc 	 ating 	 	for	one	,	you	should	ask	about	them	.
and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	.
the	 angio 	 genesis 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	is	 follow 	 ing 	 	 al 	 most 	 	300	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	and	there	are	about	100	more	 drug 	 s 	 	in	that	 pipe 	 line 	 	.
so	consider	the	approved	 one 	 s 	 	,	look	for	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	but	then	between	what	the	doctor	can	do	for	you	,	we	need	to	start	 ask 	 ing 	 	what	can	we	do	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 theme 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	we	can	empower	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	do	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 doctor 	 s 	 	ca	n't	do	for	us	,	which	is	to	use	knowledge	and	take	action	.
and	if	mother	nature	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	some	 clue 	 s 	 	,	we	think	that	there	might	be	a	new	future	in	the	value	of	how	we	eat	.
and	what	we	eat	is	 re 	 ally 	 	our	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.
jc	:	right	.	and	 a 	 long 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	lines	,	for	people	who	might	have	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	for	cancer	,	would	you	recommend	 pur 	 suing 	 	any	 treat 	 ments 	 	sort	of	 prophylactic 	 ally 	 	or	 simpl 	 y 	 	 pur 	 suing 	 	the	right	diet	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	tomato	sauce	?
wl	:	well	,	you	know	,	there	's	abundant	 epidemio 	 logical 	 	evidence	.
and	i	think	in	the	information	age	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	long	to	go	to	a	credible	source	like	pubmed	,	the	national	library	of	medicine	,	to	look	for	 epidemio 	 logical 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	for	cancer	risk	 r 	 eduction 	 	based	on	diet	and	based	on	common	 medic 	 ations 	 	.
and	that	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 any 	 body 	 	can	look	 in 	 to 	 	.
jc	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	well	,	thank	you	so	much	.
