now	it	's	 even 	 ing 	 	,	and	my	 d 	 inner 	 	first	grew	cold	--	and	then	grew	mold	.
i	'm	still	on	hold	.	i	'm	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	silence	.

thank	you	.	good	 even 	 ing 	 	and	welcome	to	``	spot	the	ted	 present 	 er 	 	who	used	to	be	a	broadway	 accompani 	 st 	 	.	``
ok	.	when	i	was	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	the	 time 	 s 	 	column	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	deal	was	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	you	'll	be	 s 	 ent 	 	the	 cool 	 est 	 	,	 hot 	 test 	 	,	 s 	 lick 	 est 	 	new	 gadget 	 s 	 	.
every	week	it	'll	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	your	door	.
you	get	to	try	them	out	,	play	with	them	,	evaluate	them	 un 	 til 	 	the	 novel 	 ty 	 	 wear 	 s 	 	out	,	before	you	have	to	 s 	 end 	 	them	back	.
and	you	'll	get	paid	for	it	.	you	can	think	about	it	,	if	you	want	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	technology	nut	,	and	i	 absolute 	 ly 	 	love	it	.
the	job	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	came	with	one	small	 down 	 side 	 	.	and	that	is	:	they	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	publish	my	email	address	at	the	end	of	every	column	.
and	what	i	've	 notice 	 d 	 	is	--	first	of	all	,	you	get	an	 in 	 credible 	 	amount	of	email	.
if	you	ever	are	 feel 	 ing 	 	 lone 	 ly 	 	,	get	a	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	column	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	will	get	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 email 	 s 	 	.	and	the	email	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	a	lot	 to 	 day 	 	is	about	 frust 	 ration 	 	.
people	are	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	 thing 	 s 	 	--	ok	,	i	just	had	an	alarm	come	up	on	my	screen	.	 luck 	 y 	 	you	ca	n't	see	it	.
people	are	 feel 	 ing 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	.	they	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	it	's	too	much	technology	too	fast	.
it	may	be	good	technology	,	but	i	feel	like	there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	of	a	support	structure	.
there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	help	.	there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	thought	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	design	of	it	to	make	it	easy	and	 enjoy 	 able 	 	to	use	.
one	time	i	wrote	a	column	about	my	 effort 	 s 	 	to	reach	dell	technical	support	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	12	 hour 	 s 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	700	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	from	 read 	 ers 	 	on	the	 feed 	 back 	 	 board 	 s 	 	on	the	 time 	 s 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	from	 user 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	me	too	!	``	and	,	``	here	's	my	tale	of	woe	.	``	i	call	it	``	 soft 	 ware 	 	rage	.	``
and	man	,	let	me	tell	you	,	 who 	 ever 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	out	how	to	make	money	off	of	 th 	 is 	 	 frust 	 ration 	 	will	--	oh	,	how	did	that	get	up	there	?	just	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
ok	,	so	why	is	the	problem	 accele 	 rating 	 	?	part	of	the	problem	is	,	 iron 	 ically 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	industry	 ha 	 s 	 	put	so	much	thought	 in 	 to 	 	making	 thing 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	use	.
i	'll	show	you	what	i	mean	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	computer	 inter 	 face 	 	used	to	look	like	,	dos	.
over	the	 year 	 s 	 	it	's	gotten	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	use	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	original	mac	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	.
reagan	was	 p 	 resident 	 	.	madonna	was	still	a	 br 	 un 	 ette 	 	.
and	the	entire	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	good	part	--	the	entire	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	fit	in	211k	.
you	could	n't	put	the	mac	os	10	logo	in	211k	!
so	the	 iron 	 y 	 	is	that	 a 	 s 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	use	a	less	technical	,	 broad 	 er 	 	audience	was	coming	 in 	 to 	 	contact	with	 th 	 is 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	for	the	first	time	.
i	once	had	the	distinct	privilege	of	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	on	the	apple	call	center	for	a	day	.
the	guy	had	a	 duplic 	 ate 	 	 head 	 set 	 	for	me	to	listen	to	.
and	the	 call 	 s 	 	that	--	you	know	how	they	say	,	``	your	call	may	be	 record 	 ed 	 	for	quality	assurance	?	``
mm	-	mmm	.	your	call	may	be	 record 	 ed 	 	so	that	they	can	collect	the	 funni 	 est 	 	dumb	user	 st 	 ories 	 	and	pass	them	around	on	a	cd	.
which	they	do	.
and	i	have	a	copy	.
it	's	in	your	tedgift	bag	.	no	,	no	.
with	your	 voice 	 s 	 	on	it	!
some	of	the	 st 	 ories 	 	are	just	so	classic	,	and	yet	so	 understand 	 able 	 	.
a	woman	 call 	 ed 	 	apple	to	complain	that	her	mouse	was	 squeak 	 ing 	 	--	making	a	 squeak 	 ing 	 	noise	.
and	the	technician	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	ma'am	,	what	do	you	mean	your	mouse	is	 squeak 	 ing 	 	?	``
she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	all	i	can	tell	you	is	that	it	 squeak 	 s 	 	 loud 	 er 	 	the	 fast 	 er 	 	i	move	it	 a 	 cross 	 	the	screen	.	``
and	the	technician	's	like	,	``	ma'am	,	you	've	got	the	mouse	up	against	the	screen	?	``
she	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	well	,	the	 mess 	 age 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	'	click	here	to	 continu 	 e 	 	.	'	``	well	,	if	you	like	that	one	,	how	much	time	have	we	got	?
 an 	 other 	 	one	,	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	true	!	--	his	computer	had	 crash 	 ed 	 	,	and	he	told	the	technician	he	could	n't	 re 	 start 	 	it	no	matter	how	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	he	 type 	 d 	 	11	.
and	the	technician	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	?	why	are	you	 ty 	 ping 	 	11	?	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	 mess 	 age 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	'	error	type	11.	'	``	so	we	must	admit	that	some	of	the	blame	 fall 	 s 	 	 square 	 ly 	 	at	the	feet	of	the	 user 	 s 	 	.
but	why	is	the	technical	 over 	 load 	 	crisis	,	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	crisis	,	 accele 	 rating 	 	now	?	in	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	world	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	the	 consumer 	 s 	 	want	 every 	 thing 	 	to	be	 small 	 er 	 	,	 small 	 er 	 	,	 small 	 er 	 	.
so	the	 gadget 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 tin 	 ier 	 	and	 tin 	 ier 	 	but	our	 finger 	 s 	 	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	 stay 	 ing 	 	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	.
so	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	be	more	and	more	of	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
 soft 	 ware 	 	is	subject	to	 an 	 other 	 	 prim 	 al 	 	force	:	the	 man 	 date 	 	to	 re 	 lease 	 	more	and	more	 version 	 s 	 	.
when	you	buy	a	piece	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	it	's	not	like	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	vase	or	a	 can 	 dy 	 	bar	,	where	you	own	it	.
it	's	more	like	 join 	 ing 	 	a	club	where	you	pay	 due 	 s 	 	every	year	.
and	every	year	,	they	say	,	``	we	've	 add 	 ed 	 	more	 feature 	 s 	 	and	we	'll	sell	it	to	you	for	$	99	.	``
i	know	one	guy	who	's	 s 	 pent 	 	$	4,000	just	on	photoshop	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	 soft 	 ware 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	make	35	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	revenue	from	just	these	 soft 	 ware 	 	 up 	 grade 	 s 	 	.
i	call	it	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	 up 	 grade 	 	paradox	--	which	is	that	if	you	improve	a	piece	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	you	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	ruin	it	.
i	mean	,	 micro 	 soft 	 	word	was	last	just	a	word	processor	in	,	you	know	,	the	eisenhower	 administr 	 ation 	 	.
but	what	's	the	 alter 	 native 	 	?	 micro 	 soft 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	.	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	wait	a	minute	.	 every 	 one 	 	 complain 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 add 	 ing 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	.
let	's	create	a	word	processor	that	's	just	a	word	processor	.
simple	,	 pur 	 e 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	not	do	web	 page 	 s 	 	,	is	not	a	 data 	 base 	 	.	``
and	it	came	out	.	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	 micro 	 soft 	 	write	.
and	 non 	 e 	 	of	you	are	 nod 	 d 	 ing 	 	in	 acknowledg 	 ment 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 di 	 ed 	 	.
it	 tank 	 ed 	 	.	no	one	ever	 b 	 ought 	 	it	.
i	call	 th 	 is 	 	the	 s 	 port 	 	 util 	 ity 	 	principle	.	people	like	to	surround	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	 un 	 necess 	 ary 	 	power	,	right	?
they	do	n't	need	the	 data 	 base 	 	and	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	but	they	're	like	,	``	well	,	i	'll	 up 	 grade 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	i	might	,	you	know	,	i	might	need	that	 some 	 day 	 	.	``
so	the	problem	is	:	 a 	 s 	 	you	add	more	 feature 	 s 	 	,	where	are	they	going	to	go	?
where	are	you	going	to	stick	them	?	you	 on 	 ly 	 	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	design	 tool 	 s 	 	.
you	can	do	 button 	 s 	 	;	you	can	do	 s 	 lider 	 s 	 	,	pop	-	up	 menu 	 s 	 	,	sub	-	 menu 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	're	not	 care 	 ful 	 	about	how	you	 choos 	 e 	 	,	you	wind	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	un	-	retouched	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	joke	--	un	-	retouched	photo	of	 micro 	 soft 	 	word	,	the	copy	that	you	have	,	with	all	the	 tool 	 bar 	 s 	 	open	.
you	've	 obvious 	 ly 	 	never	 open 	 ed 	 	all	the	 tool 	 bar 	 s 	 	,	but	all	you	have	to	type	in	is	 th 	 is 	 	little	,	 teen 	 y 	 	window	down	here	.
and	we	've	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	the	age	of	 inter 	 face 	 	 matric 	 es 	 	,	where	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	and	 option 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	do	two	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	you	know	:	a	 vert 	 ical 	 	and	a	 horizon 	 tal 	 	.	you	 guy 	 s 	 	all	 complain 	 ed 	 	about	how	 micro 	 soft 	 	word	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 bullet 	 ing 	 	your	 list 	 s 	 	and	 under 	 lining 	 	your	 link 	 s 	 	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
the	off	 s 	 witch 	 	is	in	there	 some 	 where 	 	.
i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	it	's	there	!
part	of	the	art	of	 design 	 ing 	 	a	simple	,	good	 inter 	 face 	 	,	is	 know 	 ing 	 	when	to	use	which	one	of	these	 feature 	 s 	 	.
here	is	the	log	off	 dia 	 log 	 	box	for	 window 	 s 	 	2000	.
there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	four	 choice 	 s 	 	,	so	why	are	they	in	a	pop	-	up	menu	?
it	's	not	like	the	rest	of	the	screen	is	so	full	of	other	 component 	 s 	 	that	you	need	to	collapse	the	 choice 	 s 	 	.
they	could	have	put	them	all	out	in	view	.
here	's	apple	's	take	on	the	exact	same	 dia 	 log 	 	box	.
thank	you	--	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	designed	the	 dia 	 log 	 	box	.	no	,	no	,	no	.
 al 	 ready 	 	,	we	can	see	that	apple	and	 micro 	 soft 	 	have	a	 severe 	 ly 	 	 diverge 	 nt 	 	approach	to	 soft 	 ware 	 	design	.
 micro 	 soft 	 	's	approach	to	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	:	let	's	break	it	down	;	let	's	just	make	it	more	 step 	 s 	 	.
there	are	these	``	 wizard 	 s 	 	``	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	you	know	,	there	's	a	new	version	of	 window 	 s 	 	coming	out	 th 	 is 	 	fall	.
if	they	 continu 	 e 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	pace	,	there	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 tell 	 ing 	 	where	they	might	wind	up	.
``	welcome	to	the	type	-	a	-	word	wizard	.	``	ok	,	i	'll	bite	.	let	's	click	``	next	``	to	 continu 	 e 	 	.
from	the	drop	-	down	menu	,	 choos 	 e 	 	the	first	letter	you	want	to	type	.	ok	.
so	there	is	a	limit	that	we	do	n't	want	to	cross	.	so	what	is	the	answer	?
how	do	you	pack	in	all	these	 feature 	 s 	 	in	a	simple	,	intelligent	way	?
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 consist 	 ency 	 	with	possible	,	real	-	world	 equi 	 valent 	 s 	 	,	 trash 	 can 	 	 fold 	 er 	 	when	possible	,	label	 thing 	 s 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	.
but	i	beg	of	the	 design 	 ers 	 	here	to	break	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	if	they	 viol 	 ate 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	rule	of	all	,	which	is	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.	now	what	do	i	mean	by	that	?
i	'm	going	to	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	where	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 make 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	not	 consist 	 ent 	 	,	but	it	's	better	.
if	you	are	 buy 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	on	the	web	,	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	put	in	your	address	and	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 choos 	 e 	 	which	country	you	're	from	,	ok	?
there	are	200	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	.	we	like	to	think	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	global	village	.
i	'm	sorry	;	it	's	not	one	yet	.
it	's	 main 	 ly 	 	,	like	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	europe	and	japan	.
so	why	is	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	the	``	u	``	s	?
you	have	to	scroll	,	like	,	seven	 screen 	 s 	 	-	full	to	get	to	it	.
now	it	would	be	 in 	 consist 	 ent 	 	to	put	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	first	,	but	it	would	be	intelligent	.	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 be 	 en 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	on	before	,	but	why	in	god	's	name	do	you	shut	down	a	 window 	 s 	 	pc	by	 click 	 ing 	 	a	button	 call 	 ed 	 	``	start	?	``
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	pet	one	of	mine	:	you	have	a	 print 	 er 	 	.
most	of	the	time	,	you	want	to	print	one	copy	of	your	document	,	in	page	order	,	on	that	 print 	 er 	 	.
so	why	in	god	's	name	do	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	every	time	you	print	?
it	's	like	a	747	shuttle	 cock 	 pit 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 button 	 s 	 	at	the	bottom	,	you	'll	notice	,	is	not	``	print	.	``
now	,	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	apple	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	company	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 embrace 	 d 	 	the	cult	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.

you	ca	n't	keep	a	good	idea	down	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
even	 window 	 s 	 	is	a	hack	.	we	're	kind	of	based	 loose 	 ly 	 	on	the	mac	.
so	it	's	big	,	so	it	's	 s 	 low 	 	.	you	've	got	 no 	 where 	 	to	go	.	i	'm	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	praise	.
i	write	the	code	that	 fit 	 s 	 	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
big	 mediocr 	 ity 	 	in	every	way	.
we	've	 enter 	 ed 	 	planet	 domin 	 ation 	 	mode	.
you	'll	have	no	choice	;	you	'll	buy	my	code	.
i	am	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	and	i	write	the	code	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	there	are	 re 	 ally 	 	two	microsofts	.
there	's	the	old	one	,	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 window 	 s 	 	and	 off 	 ice 	 	.
they	're	 dy 	 ing 	 	to	throw	the	whole	thing	out	and	start	fresh	,	but	they	ca	n't	.	they	're	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	add	-	ons	and	other	company	stuff	 lock 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	old	1982	 cha 	 s 	 sis 	 	.
but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	new	 micro 	 soft 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	good	,	simple	 inter 	 face 	 	 design 	 s 	 	.
i	 like 	 d 	 	the	media	center	pc	.	i	 like 	 d 	 	the	 micro 	 soft 	 	spot	watch	.
the	 wire 	 less 	 	watch	 flop 	 ped 	 	 mis 	 er 	 ably 	 	in	the	market	,	but	it	was	n't	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	n't	 simpl 	 y 	 	and	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	designed	.
let	's	put	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	:	would	you	pay	$	10	a	month	to	have	a	watch	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 re 	 charged 	 	every	night	,	like	your	cell	phone	,	and	 stop 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	when	you	 leav 	 e 	 	your	area	code	?
the	 sign 	 s 	 	might	 indic 	 ate 	 	that	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	crunch	is	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	get	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
so	is	there	any	hope	?	the	 screen 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 small 	 er 	 	.
people	are	 illumi 	 nating 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	 manual 	 s 	 	in	the	boxes	.
the	 thing 	 s 	 	are	coming	out	at	a	 fast 	 er 	 	pace	.
it	's	funny	--	when	steve	 job 	 s 	 	came	back	to	apple	in	1997	,	after	12	 year 	 s 	 	away	,	it	was	the	macworld	expo	--	he	came	to	the	stage	in	that	black	 turtle 	 neck 	 	and	 jean 	 s 	 	,	and	he	sort	of	did	 th 	 is 	 	.	the	crowd	went	wild	,	but	i	'm	like	,	where	have	i	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	?	i	had	just	 s 	 een 	 	the	movie	``	evita	``	--	--	with	madonna	,	and	i	'm	like	,	you	know	what	,	i	've	got	to	do	one	about	steve	 job 	 s 	 	.
it	wo	n't	be	easy	.	you	'll	think	i	'm	strange	.
when	i	try	to	explain	why	i	'm	back	after	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	press	apple	's	future	is	black	.
you	wo	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	.
all	that	you	see	is	a	kid	in	his	 teen 	 s 	 	who	 start 	 ed 	 	out	in	a	 gar 	 age 	 	with	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 bud 	 dy 	 	named	woz	.
you	try	 rhym 	 ing 	 	with	 gar 	 age 	 	!
do	n't	cry	for	me	,	cupertino	.
the	truth	is	,	i	never	left	you	.
i	know	the	 rope 	 s 	 	now	,	know	what	the	 trick 	 s 	 	are	.
i	made	a	fortune	over	at	pixar	.
do	n't	cry	for	me	,	cupertino	.	i	've	still	got	the	drive	and	vision	.
i	still	wear	 sand 	 al 	 s 	 	in	any	weather	.	it	's	just	that	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	they	're	gucci	leather	.
thank	you	.	so	steve	 job 	 s 	 	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	 simpl 	 icity 	 	and	 e 	 leg 	 ance 	 	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	.	and	the	truth	is	,	for	 year 	 s 	 	i	was	a	little	 depress 	 ed 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	americans	 obvious 	 ly 	 	did	not	value	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	mac	had	three	percent	market	share	and	 window 	 s 	 	had	95	percent	market	share	.
people	did	not	think	it	was	worth	 put 	 ting 	 	a	price	on	it	.
so	i	was	a	little	 depress 	 ed 	 	--	then	i	heard	al	gore	's	talk	,	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	i	did	n't	know	the	meaning	of	 depress 	 ed 	 	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	i	was	wrong	,	right	?	 be 	 cause 	 	the	ipod	came	out	,	and	it	 viol 	 ated 	 	every	bit	of	common	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
other	 product 	 s 	 	cost	less	.	other	 product 	 s 	 	had	more	 feature 	 s 	 	.
they	had	voice	 record 	 ers 	 	and	fm	 transmit 	 ter 	 s 	 	.
the	other	 product 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 back 	 ed 	 	by	 micro 	 soft 	 	with	an	open	standard	,	not	apple	's	 prop 	 riet 	 y 	 	standard	.
but	the	ipod	won	!	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	one	they	 want 	 ed 	 	.
the	 less 	 on 	 	was	:	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 sell 	 s 	 	.
and	there	are	 sign 	 s 	 	that	the	industry	is	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 mess 	 age 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	company	that	's	 d 	 one 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	with	 simpl 	 icity 	 	and	 e 	 leg 	 ance 	 	.
the	sonos	thing	--	it	's	 catch 	 ing 	 	on	.
i	've	got	just	a	couple	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.	 physical 	 ly 	 	,	a	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	,	elegant	,	 think 	 ing 	 	coming	 a 	 long 	 	 late 	 ly 	 	.
when	you	have	a	digital	camera	,	how	do	you	get	the	 picture 	 s 	 	back	to	your	computer	?
well	,	you	either	haul	around	a	usb	cable	or	you	buy	a	card	 read 	 er 	 	and	haul	that	around	.
either	one	,	you	're	going	to	lose	.	what	i	do	is	,	i	take	out	the	 memor 	 y 	 	card	,	and	i	fold	it	in	half	,	 reveal 	 ing 	 	usb	 contact 	 s 	 	.
i	just	stick	it	in	the	computer	,	 off 	 load 	 	the	 picture 	 s 	 	,	put	it	right	back	in	the	camera	.	i	never	have	to	lose	 any 	 thing 	 	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	chris	,	you	're	the	source	of	all	power	.
will	you	be	my	power	plug	?
chris	anderson	:	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	.
dp	:	hold	that	and	do	n't	let	go	.	you	might	have	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	apple	's	new	 lap 	 top 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	power	cord	.	it	 hook 	 s 	 	on	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	every	one	of	you	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	at	some	point	in	your	 live 	 s 	 	,	or	one	of	your	children	.	you	walk	 a 	 long 	 	--	and	i	'm	about	to	pull	 th 	 is 	 	onto	the	floor	.	i	do	n't	care	.	it	's	a	 loan 	 er 	 	.
here	we	go	.	 who 	 a 	 	!	it	's	 magnet 	 ic 	 	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	pull	the	 lap 	 top 	 	onto	the	floor	.
in	my	 ver 	 y 	 	last	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	i	do	a	lot	of	my	work	using	speech	 re 	 cognition 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	and	you	have	to	be	kind	of	quiet	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	is	nervous	.
``	speech	 re 	 cognition 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	great	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 email 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.	period	.
like	,	i	get	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	a	day	.	period	.
and	it	's	not	just	what	i	 dict 	 ate 	 	that	it	 write 	 s 	 	down	.	period	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	use	 th 	 is 	 	feature	 call 	 ed 	 	voice	 macro 	 s 	 	.	period	.	``
correct	``	 dis 	 suade 	 	``	.	``	not	just	.	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	ideal	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	the	echo	from	the	hall	and	stuff	.
but	the	point	is	:	i	can	respond	to	people	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	by	 say 	 ing 	 	a	short	word	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	it	write	out	a	much	 long 	 er 	 	thing	.	so	if	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	me	a	fan	letter	,	i	'll	say	,	``	 thank 	 s 	 	for	that	.	``
and	 con 	 verse 	 ly 	 	,	if	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	me	hate	mail	--	which	 happen 	 s 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	--	i	say	,	``	piss	off	.	``
so	that	's	my	 dirt 	 y 	 	little	secret	.	do	n't	tell	 any 	 one 	 	.
so	the	point	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	version	eight	of	 th 	 is 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	and	do	you	know	what	they	put	in	version	eight	?
no	new	 feature 	 s 	 	.	it	's	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	in	 soft 	 ware 	 	!
the	company	put	no	new	 feature 	 s 	 	.	they	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	'll	make	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	work	right	.	``	right	.
 be 	 cause 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	people	had	 b 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	out	--	95	percent	 accu 	 racy 	 	was	all	they	got	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	one	in	20	 word 	 s 	 	is	wrong	--	and	they	put	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 draw 	 er 	 	.	and	the	company	got	sick	of	that	,	so	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	version	,	we	're	not	going	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	but	make	 s 	 ure 	 	it	's	 darn 	 ed 	 	accurate	.	``
and	so	that	's	what	they	did	.	 th 	 is 	 	cult	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	right	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	spread	.
my	final	 ad 	 vice 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	 consumer 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	technology	:	remember	,	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	it	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	you	,	ok	?
it	could	be	the	design	of	the	thing	you	're	using	.
be	aware	in	life	of	good	design	and	bad	design	.
and	if	you	're	among	the	people	who	create	the	stuff	,	easy	is	hard	.
pre	-	sweat	the	 detail 	 s 	 	for	your	audience	.	count	the	 tap 	 s 	 	.
remember	,	the	hard	part	is	not	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	what	 feature 	 s 	 	to	add	--	it	's	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	what	to	 leav 	 e 	 	out	.
and	best	of	all	,	your	 motiv 	 ation 	 	is	:	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 sell 	 s 	 	.
