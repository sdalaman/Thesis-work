you	know	for	me	,	the	interest	in	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	 leaf 	 let 	 	that	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	in	london	.
it	was	the	early	'90s	,	and	i	was	at	a	public	event	.
i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	 leaf 	 let 	 	and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	are	 million 	 s 	 	of	 slave 	 s 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.	``
and	i	thought	,	``	no	way	,	no	way	.	``
and	i	'm	going	to	admit	to	 hub 	 ris 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	admit	to	you	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	thought	,	``	how	can	i	be	like	a	hot	-	shot	young	full	professor	who	 teach 	 es 	 	human	 right 	 s 	 	and	not	know	 th 	 is 	 	?
so	it	ca	n't	be	true	.	``
well	,	if	you	teach	,	if	you	worship	in	the	temple	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	do	not	mock	the	 god 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	will	take	you	,	fill	you	with	curiosity	and	 desir 	 e 	 	,	and	drive	you	.	drive	you	with	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	to	change	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	went	out	and	did	a	lit	review	,	3,000	 article 	 s 	 	on	the	key	word	``	 slave 	 ry 	 	.	``
two	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	about	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	--	 on 	 ly 	 	two	.
all	the	rest	 we 	 re 	 	 historic 	 al 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	press	 piece 	 s 	 	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	full	of	 out 	 rage 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	full	of	 specul 	 ation 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	anecdotal	--	no	solid	information	.
so	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	do	a	research	project	of	my	own	.
i	went	to	five	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 slave 	 s 	 	.	i	met	 slave 	 holder 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	slave	-	based	 business 	 es 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	economic	crime	.
people	do	not	enslave	people	to	be	mean	to	them	.
they	do	it	to	make	a	profit	.
and	i	've	got	to	tell	you	,	what	i	found	out	in	the	world	in	four	different	 continent 	 s 	 	,	was	 depress 	 ing 	 ly 	 	familiar	.
like	 th 	 is 	 	:	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	in	africa	,	 whip 	 ped 	 	and	 beat 	 en 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	us	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	in	the	 field 	 s 	 	before	they	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	from	 slave 	 ry 	 	and	met	up	with	our	film	crew	.
it	was	mind	-	 blow 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	want	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	real	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	about	 lous 	 y 	 	 marriage 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	about	 job 	 s 	 	that	suck	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	people	who	can	not	walk	away	,	people	who	are	 force 	 d 	 	to	work	 with 	 out 	 	pay	,	people	who	are	 oper 	 ating 	 	24/7	under	a	threat	of	violence	and	have	no	pay	.
it	's	real	 slave 	 ry 	 	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	that	 slave 	 ry 	 	would	be	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 through 	 out 	 	all	of	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
now	,	where	is	it	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	map	in	the	sort	of	 red 	 der 	 	,	 yellow 	 er 	 	 color 	 s 	 	are	the	 place 	 s 	 	with	the	highest	 den 	 s 	 ities 	 	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
but	in	fact	that	kind	of	 blue 	 y 	 	color	are	the	 count 	 ries 	 	where	we	ca	n't	find	any	 case 	 s 	 	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
and	you	might	notice	that	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	iceland	and	greenland	where	we	ca	n't	find	any	 case 	 s 	 	of	 enslave 	 ment 	 	around	the	world	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	and	looking	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	at	 place 	 s 	 	where	 slave 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	 perpet 	 rate 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.
around	the	world	,	 slave 	 s 	 	are	used	to	destroy	the	environment	,	cutting	down	 tree 	 s 	 	in	the	amazon	;	 destroy 	 ing 	 	forest	 area 	 s 	 	in	west	africa	;	 min 	 ing 	 	and	 spread 	 ing 	 	 merc 	 ury 	 	around	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	ghana	and	the	congo	;	 destroy 	 ing 	 	the	 coast 	 al 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	in	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 har 	 row 	 ing 	 	 link 	 age 	 	between	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	our	environment	and	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	our	human	 right 	 s 	 	.
now	,	how	on	earth	did	we	get	to	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	we	have	27	million	people	in	 slave 	 ry 	 	in	the	year	2010	?
that	's	double	the	number	that	came	out	of	africa	in	the	entire	transatlantic	slave	trade	.
well	,	it	 build 	 s 	 	up	with	these	 factor 	 s 	 	.
they	are	not	 caus 	 al 	 	,	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 support 	 ing 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	.
one	we	all	know	about	,	the	population	explosion	:	the	world	 go 	 es 	 	from	two	billion	people	to	 al 	 most 	 	seven	billion	people	in	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 ing 	 	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	make	you	a	slave	.
add	in	the	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 vulner 	 ability 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	civil	 war 	 s 	 	,	ethnic	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	 klepto 	 cratic 	 	 government 	 s 	 	,	disease	...	you	name	it	,	you	know	it	.
we	understand	how	that	 work 	 s 	 	.	in	some	 count 	 ries 	 	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	at	once	,	like	sierra	leone	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	push	enormous	 part 	 s 	 	...	about	a	billion	people	in	the	world	,	in	fact	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	,	live	on	the	edge	,	live	in	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	they	do	n't	have	any	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	are	 usual 	 ly 	 	even	destitute	.
but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	you	a	slave	either	.
what	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	turn	a	person	who	is	destitute	and	 vulner 	 able 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	slave	,	is	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	the	rule	of	law	.
if	the	rule	of	law	is	sound	,	it	 protect 	 s 	 	the	poor	and	it	 protect 	 s 	 	the	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
but	if	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	 creep 	 s 	 	in	and	people	do	n't	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	have	that	 protect 	 ion 	 	of	the	rule	of	law	,	then	if	you	can	use	violence	,	if	you	can	use	violence	with	 imp 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	you	can	reach	out	and	harvest	the	 vulner 	 able 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
well	,	that	is	 precise 	 ly 	 	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	.
 th 	 ough 	 	,	for	a	lot	of	people	,	the	people	who	step	 in 	 to 	 	 slave 	 ry 	 	 to 	 day 	 	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	get	 kidnap 	 ped 	 	or	 knock 	 ed 	 	over	the	head	.
they	come	 in 	 to 	 	 slave 	 ry 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
all	around	the	world	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	told	an	 al 	 most 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	story	.
people	say	,	``	i	was	home	,	 some 	 one 	 	came	 in 	 to 	 	our	village	,	they	stood	up	in	the	back	of	a	truck	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	'	i	've	got	 job 	 s 	 	,	who	 need 	 s 	 	a	job	?	'	``	and	they	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	or	i	would	do	in	the	same	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	guy	 look 	 ed 	 	 sketch 	 y 	 	.	i	was	suspicious	,	but	my	children	 we 	 re 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	medicine	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	i	had	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	i	could	to	earn	some	money	to	support	the	people	i	care	about	.	``
they	climb	 in 	 to 	 	the	back	of	the	truck	.	they	go	off	with	the	person	who	 recruit 	 s 	 	them	.
ten	 mile 	 s 	 	,	100	 mile 	 s 	 	,	1,000	 mile 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	they	find	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	 dirt 	 y 	 	,	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	 de 	 meaning 	 	work	.
they	take	it	for	a	little	while	,	but	when	they	try	to	 leav 	 e 	 	,	bang	!	,	the	hammer	 come 	 s 	 	down	,	and	they	discover	they	're	 enslave 	 d 	 	.
now	,	that	kind	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	what	 slave 	 ry 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	all	through	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
but	there	is	one	thing	that	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	and	novel	about	 slave 	 ry 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	that	is	a	complete	collapse	in	the	price	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	expensive	in	the	past	,	dirt	cheap	now	.
even	the	business	 program 	 s 	 	have	 start 	 ed 	 	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	just	want	to	share	a	little	clip	for	you	.
daphne	:	ok	.	llively	 discuss 	 ion 	 	 guarantee 	 d 	 	here	,	 a 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	get	macro	and	talk	 commodit 	 ies 	 	.
 continu 	 ing 	 	here	in	the	studio	with	our	guest	michael	o'donohue	,	head	of	 commodit 	 ies 	 	at	four	 continent 	 s 	 	capital	management	.
and	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 join 	 ed 	 	by	brent	lawson	from	lawson	frisk	securities	.
brent	lawson	:	happy	to	be	here	.
d	:	good	to	have	you	with	us	,	brent	.
now	,	 gentle 	 men 	 	...	brent	,	where	is	your	money	going	 th 	 is 	 	year	?
bl	:	well	daphne	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	going	short	on	gas	and	oil	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	and	 cast 	 ing 	 	our	net	just	a	little	bit	 wide 	 r 	 	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	like	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	story	a	lot	.
if	you	look	at	a	long	-	term	chart	,	 price 	 s 	 	are	at	 historic 	 al 	 	 low 	 s 	 	and	yet	global	demand	for	 force 	 d 	 	labor	is	still	real	strong	.
so	,	that	's	a	scenario	that	we	think	we	should	be	 capital 	 izing 	 	on	.
d	:	michael	,	what	's	your	take	on	the	people	story	?	are	you	 interest 	 ed 	 	?
michael	o'donoghue	:	oh	 definite 	 ly 	 	.	non	-	voluntary	labor	's	 great 	 est 	 	advantage	 a 	 s 	 	an	asset	is	the	 end 	 less 	 	supply	.
we	're	not	about	to	run	out	of	people	.	no	other	 commodit 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	that	.
bl	:	daphne	,	if	i	may	draw	your	attention	to	one	thing	.
that	is	that	private	 equ 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 sniff 	 ing 	 	around	,	and	that	 tell 	 s 	 	me	that	 th 	 is 	 	market	is	about	to	explode	.
africans	and	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	usual	,	south	americans	,	and	eastern	europeans	in	 part 	 icular 	 	are	on	our	buy	list	.
d	:	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	micheal	,	bottom	line	,	what	do	you	recommend	?
mo	:	we	're	 recommend 	 ing 	 	to	our	 client 	 s 	 	a	buy	and	hold	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
there	's	no	need	to	play	the	market	.
there	's	a	lot	of	 vulner 	 able 	 	people	out	there	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
d	:	 excit 	 ing 	 	stuff	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
kevin	bales	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	you	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	.	that	's	a	 s 	 po 	 of 	 	.
 th 	 ough 	 	i	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	 jaw 	 s 	 	drop	,	drop	,	drop	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	got	it	.
mtv	europe	 work 	 ed 	 	with	us	and	made	that	 s 	 po 	 of 	 	,	and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 slip 	 ping 	 	it	in	between	music	 video 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	 introduc 	 tion 	 	,	which	i	think	is	kind	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
here	's	the	 re 	 ality 	 	.
the	price	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	last	4,000	 year 	 s 	 	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	money	 ha 	 s 	 	 average 	 d 	 	about	40,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
capital	purchase	 item 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	that	the	lines	cross	when	the	population	 explode 	 s 	 	.
the	average	price	of	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	around	the	world	,	is	about	90	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
they	are	more	expensive	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	north	america	.
 slave 	 s 	 	cost	between	3,000	to	8,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	north	america	,	but	i	could	take	you	 place 	 s 	 	in	india	or	nepal	where	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	can	be	 acquir 	 ed 	 	for	five	or	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
they	key	here	is	that	people	have	 cease 	 d 	 	to	be	that	capital	purchase	item	and	 be 	 come 	 	like	styrofoam	 cup 	 s 	 	.
you	buy	them	 cheap 	 ly 	 	,	you	use	them	,	you	crumple	them	up	,	and	then	when	you	're	 d 	 one 	 	with	them	you	just	throw	them	away	.
these	young	 boy 	 s 	 	are	in	nepal	.
they	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	transport	system	on	a	 quar 	 ry 	 	run	by	a	 slave 	 holder 	 	.
there	are	no	 road 	 s 	 	there	,	so	they	carry	 load 	 s 	 	of	stone	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 back 	 s 	 	,	often	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	weight	,	up	and	down	the	himalaya	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	us	,	``	you	know	,	we	ca	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	here	,	but	we	ca	n't	even	seem	to	die	either	.	``
it	's	a	 horr 	 ible 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
and	if	there	is	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	positive	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	that	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	--	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	young	men	like	 th 	 is 	 	who	are	still	 enslave 	 d 	 	--	there	are	ex	-	 slave 	 s 	 	who	are	now	 work 	 ing 	 	to	free	 other 	 s 	 	.
or	,	we	say	,	frederick	douglass	is	in	the	house	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	've	ever	had	a	 day 	 dream 	 	about	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	.	what	would	it	be	like	to	meet	harriet	tubman	?
what	would	it	be	like	to	meet	frederick	douglass	?	``
i	've	got	to	say	,	one	of	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	 part 	 s 	 	about	my	job	is	that	i	get	to	,	and	i	want	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
his	name	is	james	kofi	annan	.	he	was	a	slave	child	in	ghana	 enslave 	 d 	 	in	the	 fish 	 ing 	 	industry	,	and	he	now	,	after	 es 	 cape 	 	and	building	a	new	life	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	we	work	 close 	 ly 	 	with	to	go	back	and	get	people	out	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	james	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	that	he	 work 	 s 	 	with	.
james	kofi	annan	:	he	was	hit	with	a	 padd 	 le 	 	in	the	head	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	my	 child 	 hood 	 	when	i	used	to	work	here	.
kb	:	james	and	our	country	director	in	ghana	,	emmanuel	otoo	are	now	 receiv 	 ing 	 	regular	death	 threat 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	two	of	them	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	 convict 	 ions 	 	and	 imprison 	 ment 	 	for	three	human	 traffic 	 ker 	 s 	 	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	in	ghana	for	 en 	 s 	 lav 	 ing 	 	people	,	from	the	 fish 	 ing 	 	industry	,	for	 en 	 s 	 lav 	 ing 	 	children	.
now	,	 every 	 thing 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	i	admit	,	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 dis 	 heart 	 en 	 ing 	 	.
but	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	positive	side	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	that	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	27	million	people	who	are	in	 slave 	 ry 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	's	a	lot	of	people	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	 small 	 est 	 	fraction	of	the	global	population	to	ever	be	in	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
and	 like 	 wise 	 	,	the	40	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	they	generate	 in 	 to 	 	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	each	year	is	the	 tin 	 iest 	 	proportion	of	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	ever	be	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	slave	labor	.
 slave 	 ry 	 	,	 il 	 legal 	 	in	every	country	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	to	the	 edge 	 s 	 	of	our	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	in	a	way	,	 with 	 out 	 	us	even	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	 pre 	 cipice 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	 extinct 	 ion 	 	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	us	to	give	it	a	big	boot	and	knock	it	over	.	and	get	rid	of	it	.
and	it	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
now	,	if	we	do	that	,	if	we	put	the	 resource 	 s 	 	and	the	focus	to	it	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	cost	to	get	people	out	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	?
well	,	first	,	before	i	even	tell	you	the	cost	i	've	got	to	be	 absolute 	 ly 	 	clear	.
we	do	not	buy	people	out	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
 buy 	 ing 	 	people	out	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	is	like	 pay 	 ing 	 	a	burglar	to	get	your	 tele 	 vision 	 	back	;	it	's	 a 	 bet 	 ting 	 	a	crime	.
 liber 	 ation 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	 cost 	 s 	 	some	money	.
 liber 	 ation 	 	,	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	all	the	work	that	 come 	 s 	 	after	 liber 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	not	an	event	,	it	's	a	process	.
it	's	about	 help 	 ing 	 	people	to	build	 live 	 s 	 	of	dignity	,	 st 	 ability 	 	,	economic	 auto 	 nomy 	 	,	 citizen 	 ship 	 	.
well	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	india	where	 cost 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	low	,	that	family	,	that	three	-	generation	family	that	you	see	there	who	 we 	 re 	 	in	 her 	 edit 	 ary 	 	 slave 	 ry 	 	--	so	,	that	 grand 	 dad 	 	there	,	was	born	a	baby	 in 	 to 	 	 slave 	 ry 	 	--	but	the	total	cost	,	amortized	 a 	 cross 	 	the	rest	of	the	work	,	was	about	150	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	that	family	out	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	and	then	take	them	through	a	two	year	process	to	build	a	 s 	 table 	 	life	of	 citizen 	 ship 	 	and	education	.
a	boy	in	ghana	 rescu 	 ed 	 	from	 fish 	 ing 	 	 slave 	 ry 	 	,	about	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	north	america	,	much	more	expensive	.	legal	 cost 	 s 	 	,	medical	 cost 	 s 	 	...
we	understand	that	it	's	expensive	here	:	about	30,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
but	most	of	the	people	in	the	world	in	 slave 	 ry 	 	live	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	 cost 	 s 	 	are	 low 	 est 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	the	global	average	is	about	what	it	is	for	ghana	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	when	you	 multi 	 ply 	 	it	up	,	the	 estimate 	 d 	 	cost	of	not	just	 free 	 dom 	 	but	 sustain 	 able 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	for	the	entire	27	million	people	on	the	planet	in	 slave 	 ry 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	10.8	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	what	americans	 s 	 pend 	 	on	potato	 chip 	 s 	 	and	 pretzel 	 s 	 	,	what	seattle	is	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	light	rail	system	:	 usual 	 ly 	 	the	annual	 expend 	 iture 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	on	blue	 jean 	 s 	 	,	or	in	the	last	 holi 	 day 	 	period	when	we	 b 	 ought 	 	gameboys	and	ipods	and	other	tech	 gift 	 s 	 	for	people	,	we	 s 	 pent 	 	10.8	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 tel 	 	's	fourth	quarter	 earn 	 ing 	 s 	 	:	10.8	billion	.
it	's	not	a	lot	of	money	at	the	global	level	.
in	fact	,	it	's	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
and	the	great	thing	about	it	is	that	it	's	not	money	down	a	hole	,	there	is	a	 free 	 dom 	 	 divid 	 end 	 	.	when	you	let	people	out	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	to	work	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	are	they	 motiv 	 ated 	 	?
they	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 work 	 place 	 	,	they	build	a	school	,	they	say	,	``	we	're	going	to	have	stuff	we	've	never	had	before	like	three	 square 	 s 	 	,	medicine	when	we	're	sick	,	 cloth 	 ing 	 	when	we	're	cold	.	``

that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	,	all	of	that	about	how	we	 re 	 build 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	'd	never	want	to	repeat	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	in	1865	.
four	million	people	 we 	 re 	 	 lift 	 ed 	 	up	out	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	and	then	 dump 	 ed 	 	.
 dump 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 particip 	 ation 	 	,	 de 	 cent 	 	education	,	any	kind	of	real	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	economic	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 sentence 	 d 	 	to	 generation 	 s 	 	of	violence	and	prejudice	and	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	.
and	america	is	still	 pay 	 ing 	 	the	price	for	the	 bot 	 ch 	 ed 	 	 emancip 	 ation 	 	of	1865	.
we	have	made	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	that	we	will	never	let	people	come	out	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	on	our	watch	,	and	end	up	 a 	 s 	 	second	class	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	not	going	to	happen	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 liber 	 ation 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
children	 rescu 	 ed 	 	from	 slave 	 ry 	 	in	the	 fish 	 ing 	 	industry	in	ghana	,	 re 	 unit 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	then	taken	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	back	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 village 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 build 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	economic	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	so	that	they	 be 	 come 	 	slave	-	proof	--	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 un 	 enslave 	 able 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	woman	lived	in	a	village	in	nepal	.
we	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	there	about	a	month	.
they	had	just	 beg 	 un 	 	to	come	out	of	a	 her 	 edit 	 ary 	 	kind	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
they	'd	just	 beg 	 un 	 	to	light	up	a	little	bit	,	open	up	a	little	bit	.
but	when	we	went	to	speak	with	her	,	when	we	took	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	,	the	 slave 	 holder 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	still	 menac 	 ing 	 	us	from	the	 side 	 lines 	 	.	they	had	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	back	.
i	was	 frighten 	 ed 	 	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	 frighten 	 ed 	 	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	,	``	are	you	 worri 	 ed 	 	?	are	you	 up 	 set 	 	?	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	got	hope	now	.
how	could	we	not	succeed	,	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	when	people	like	you	from	the	other	side	of	the	world	are	coming	here	to	stand	 be 	 side 	 	us	?	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	have	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	are	we	 will 	 ing 	 	to	live	in	a	world	with	 slave 	 ry 	 	?
if	we	do	n't	take	action	,	we	just	 leav 	 e 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	open	to	have	 some 	 one 	 	else	jerk	the	 string 	 s 	 	that	tie	us	to	 slave 	 ry 	 	in	the	 product 	 s 	 	we	buy	,	and	in	our	government	 poli 	 cies 	 	.
and	yet	,	if	there	's	one	thing	that	every	human	 be 	 ing 	 	can	agree	on	,	i	think	it	's	that	 slave 	 ry 	 	should	end	.
and	if	there	is	a	fundamental	 viol 	 ation 	 	of	our	human	dignity	that	we	would	all	say	is	 horr 	 ific 	 	,	it	's	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
and	we	've	got	to	say	,	what	good	is	all	of	our	intellectual	and	 politic 	 al 	 	and	economic	power	--	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	intellectual	power	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	if	we	ca	n't	use	it	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 slave 	 ry 	 	to	an	end	?
i	think	there	is	 en 	 ough 	 	intellectual	power	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 slave 	 ry 	 	to	an	end	.
and	you	know	what	?	if	we	ca	n't	do	that	,	if	we	ca	n't	use	our	intellectual	power	to	end	 slave 	 ry 	 	,	there	is	one	last	question	:	are	we	 tru 	 ly 	 	free	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	thank	you	so	much	.
