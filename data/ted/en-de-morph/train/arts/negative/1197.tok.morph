cities	are	the	 cruci 	 ble 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
they	have	 be 	 en 	 	 expand 	 ing 	 	,	 urban 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 expand 	 ing 	 	,	at	an	exponential	rate	in	the	last	200	 year 	 s 	 	so	that	by	the	second	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	century	,	the	planet	will	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	cities	.
cities	are	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	impact	on	the	environment	,	health	,	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	disease	,	finance	,	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	energy	--	they	're	all	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	 confront 	 ed 	 	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	cities	.
that	's	where	all	these	 problem 	 s 	 	come	from	.
and	the	tsunami	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	feel	we	're	facing	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 sustain 	 ability 	 	 question 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 reflect 	 ion 	 	of	the	exponential	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 urban 	 ization 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	planet	.
here	's	some	 number 	 s 	 	.
two	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	was	less	than	a	few	percent	 urban 	 ized 	 	.
it	's	now	more	than	82	percent	.
the	planet	 ha 	 s 	 	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	 half 	 way 	 	mark	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 chin 	 a 	 	's	building	300	new	cities	in	the	next	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	:	every	week	for	the	 foresee 	 able 	 	future	,	 un 	 til 	 	2050	,	every	week	more	than	a	million	people	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	to	our	cities	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	affect	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	if	you	stay	 al 	 ive 	 	,	is	going	to	be	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	cities	in	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	cities	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	negative	 a 	 spect 	 	to	them	,	are	 al 	 so 	 	the	solution	.
 be 	 cause 	 	cities	are	the	vacuum	 clean 	 ers 	 	and	the	 magnet 	 s 	 	that	have	 suck 	 ed 	 	up	creative	people	,	creating	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	wealth	and	so	on	.
so	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	dual	nature	.
and	so	there	's	an	 urge 	 nt 	 	need	for	a	scientific	 theor 	 y 	 	of	cities	.
now	these	are	my	 comrade 	 s 	 	in	 arm 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	work	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	with	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	group	of	people	,	and	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	all	the	work	,	and	i	'm	the	great	 bull 	 shit 	 ter 	 	that	tries	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	all	together	.
so	here	's	the	problem	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	all	want	.
the	10	billion	people	on	the	planet	in	2050	want	to	live	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	with	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	that	are	growing	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	not	 real 	 izing 	 	that	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 produce 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	question	is	:	is	that	what	edinburgh	and	london	and	new	york	are	going	to	look	like	in	2050	,	or	is	it	going	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	?
that	's	the	question	.
i	must	say	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 indic 	 ators 	 	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	's	going	to	look	like	,	but	let	's	talk	about	it	.
so	my	 pro 	 voc 	 ative 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	is	that	we	 desperate 	 ly 	 	need	a	serious	scientific	 theor 	 y 	 	of	cities	.
and	scientific	 theor 	 y 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 quant 	 ifiable 	 	--	 re 	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	generic	 principle 	 s 	 	that	can	be	made	 in 	 to 	 	a	 predict 	 ive 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	.
that	's	the	quest	.
is	that	 conceiv 	 able 	 	?
are	there	universal	 law 	 s 	 	?
so	here	's	two	 question 	 s 	 	that	i	have	in	my	head	when	i	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
the	first	is	:	are	cities	part	of	biology	?
is	london	a	great	big	whale	?
is	edinburgh	a	horse	?
is	 micro 	 soft 	 	a	great	big	 ant 	 hill 	 	?
what	do	we	learn	from	that	?
we	use	them	 metaphor 	 ically 	 	--	the	dna	of	a	company	,	the	 metabol 	 ism 	 	of	a	city	,	and	so	on	--	is	that	just	 bull 	 shit 	 	,	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	 bull 	 shit 	 	,	or	is	there	serious	 sub 	 stance 	 	to	it	?
and	if	that	is	the	case	,	how	come	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	kill	a	city	?
you	could	drop	an	atom	bomb	on	a	city	,	and	30	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	it	's	 surviv 	 ing 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	few	cities	fail	.
all	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	die	,	all	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
and	if	you	have	a	serious	 theor 	 y 	 	,	you	should	be	able	to	predict	when	google	is	going	to	go	bust	.
so	is	that	just	 an 	 other 	 	version	well	we	understand	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
that	is	,	you	ask	any	generic	question	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	of	a	 give 	 n 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	of	a	 give 	 n 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	 do 	 es 	 	a	tree	have	,	what	is	the	energy	 flow 	 ing 	 	through	each	branch	,	what	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 can 	 opy 	 	,	what	is	 it 	 s 	 	growth	,	what	is	 it 	 s 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	?
we	have	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	based	on	generic	universal	 principle 	 s 	 	that	can	answer	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	the	idea	is	can	we	do	the	same	for	 th 	 is 	 	?
so	the	route	in	is	 recogn 	 izing 	 	one	of	the	most	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	life	,	is	that	it	is	 scal 	 able 	 	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	over	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	range	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	 tin 	 y 	 	range	 actual 	 ly 	 	:	it	's	us	 mammal 	 s 	 	;	we	're	one	of	these	.
the	same	 principle 	 s 	 	,	the	same	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	the	same	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	at	work	in	all	of	these	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	us	,	and	it	can	scale	over	a	range	of	100	million	in	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	that	is	one	of	the	main	 reason 	 s 	 	life	is	so	 resili 	 ent 	 	and	 ro 	 bust 	 	--	we	're	going	to	discuss	that	in	a	moment	more	.
but	you	know	,	at	a	local	level	,	you	scale	;	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	is	 scale 	 d 	 	.
that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	growth	.
here	's	how	you	grew	.
rat	,	that	's	a	rat	--	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	you	.
we	're	all	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	same	.
and	you	see	,	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	grow	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	and	then	you	stop	.
and	that	line	there	is	a	 predict 	 ion 	 	from	the	same	 theor 	 y 	 	,	based	on	the	same	 principle 	 s 	 	,	that	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	that	forest	.
and	here	it	is	for	the	growth	of	a	rat	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 point 	 s 	 	on	there	are	data	 point 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	weight	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	age	.
and	you	see	,	it	 stop 	 s 	 	growing	.
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	biology	--	 al 	 so 	 	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	great	 resili 	 ence 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	for	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	and	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	cities	in	our	present	paradigm	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	 believ 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	our	whole	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 thrust 	 ing 	 	 up 	 on 	 	us	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 illustr 	 ated 	 	in	that	left	-	hand	corner	:	 hoc 	 key 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bunch	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	--	and	what	it	is	is	 the 	 ir 	 	revenue	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	age	--	all	 zoom 	 ing 	 	away	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	making	 million 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	how	do	we	understand	 th 	 is 	 	?
so	let	's	first	talk	about	biology	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	you	how	 thing 	 s 	 	scale	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	graph	.
what	is	 plot 	 ted 	 	here	is	 metabol 	 ic 	 	rate	--	how	much	energy	you	need	per	day	to	stay	 al 	 ive 	 	--	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	your	weight	,	your	mass	,	for	all	of	us	bunch	of	 organism 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 plot 	 ted 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	funny	way	by	going	up	by	 factor 	 s 	 	of	10	,	 other 	 wise 	 	you	could	n't	get	 every 	 thing 	 	on	the	graph	.
and	what	you	see	if	you	plot	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	way	is	that	 every 	 body 	 	lies	on	the	same	line	.
 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	complex	and	 divers 	 e 	 	system	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	there	's	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 express 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	each	one	of	these	 organism 	 s 	 	,	each	 sub 	 system 	 	,	each	cell	type	,	each	gene	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	own	 un 	 ique 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	niche	with	 it 	 s 	 	own	 un 	 ique 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	yet	,	 de 	 spite 	 	all	of	that	darwinian	evolution	and	natural	 s 	 election 	 	,	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	to	lie	on	a	line	.
 some 	 thing 	 	else	is	going	on	.
before	i	talk	about	that	,	i	've	written	down	at	the	bottom	there	the	 slop 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	straight	line	.
it	's	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	,	which	is	less	than	one	--	and	we	call	that	 sub 	 linear 	 	.
and	here	's	the	point	of	that	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	that	,	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	linear	,	the	 steep 	 est 	 	 slop 	 e 	 	,	then	 doub 	 ling 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	you	would	 requir 	 e 	 	double	the	amount	of	energy	.
but	it	's	 sub 	 linear 	 	,	and	what	that	 transl 	 ates 	 	 in 	 to 	 	is	that	,	if	you	double	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	organism	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	need	75	percent	more	energy	.
so	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	about	all	of	biology	is	that	it	 express 	 es 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	scale	.
the	 big 	 ger 	 	you	are	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	defined	 rule 	 s 	 	,	less	energy	per	capita	.
now	any	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 vari 	 able 	 	you	can	think	of	,	any	life	 histo 	 ry 	 	event	you	can	think	of	,	if	you	plot	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	is	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 regular 	 ity 	 	.
so	you	tell	me	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	mammal	,	i	can	tell	you	at	the	90	percent	level	 every 	 thing 	 	about	it	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	physiology	,	life	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	etc	.
and	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 network 	 s 	 	.
all	of	life	is	controlled	by	 network 	 s 	 	--	from	the	 intra 	 cellular 	 	through	the	 multi 	 cellular 	 	through	the	 eco 	 system 	 	level	.
and	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	these	 network 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	little	thing	that	 live 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	an	elephant	.
and	here	's	the	 summ 	 ary 	 	of	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	take	 t 	 hose 	 	 network 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 network 	 s 	 	,	and	you	 app 	 ly 	 	universal	 principle 	 s 	 	,	 mathe 	 mat 	 izable 	 	,	universal	 principle 	 s 	 	,	all	of	these	 scal 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	all	of	these	 constraint 	 s 	 	follow	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	forest	,	the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	your	 circul 	 atory 	 	system	,	the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	did	not	stress	in	that	 introduc 	 tion 	 	was	that	,	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	,	the	pace	of	life	 de 	 crease 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 big 	 ger 	 	.
heart	rates	are	 s 	 lower 	 	;	you	live	 long 	 er 	 	;	diffusion	of	oxygen	and	 resource 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 membrane 	 s 	 	is	 s 	 lower 	 	,	etc	.
the	question	is	:	is	any	of	 th 	 is 	 	true	for	cities	and	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	?
so	is	london	a	 scale 	 d 	 	up	birmingham	,	which	is	a	 scale 	 d 	 	up	brighton	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	?
is	new	york	a	 scale 	 d 	 	up	san	francisco	,	which	is	a	 scale 	 d 	 	up	santa	fe	?
do	n't	know	.	we	will	discuss	that	.
but	they	are	 network 	 s 	 	,	and	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	network	of	cities	is	you	.
cities	are	just	a	physical	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	your	 interact 	 ions 	 	,	our	 interact 	 ions 	 	,	and	the	 cluster 	 ing 	 	and	 group 	 ing 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	.
here	's	just	a	 symbol 	 ic 	 	picture	of	that	.
and	here	's	 scal 	 ing 	 	of	cities	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	a	mundane	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	number	of	 petro 	 l 	 	 station 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	 s 	 ize 	 	--	 plot 	 ted 	 	in	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	the	biology	--	you	see	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	kind	of	thing	.
there	is	a	 scal 	 ing 	 	.
that	is	that	the	number	of	 petro 	 l 	 	 station 	 s 	 	in	the	city	is	now	 give 	 n 	 	to	you	when	you	tell	me	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
the	 slop 	 e 	 	of	that	is	less	than	linear	.
there	is	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	scale	.
less	 petro 	 l 	 	 station 	 s 	 	per	capita	the	 big 	 ger 	 	you	are	--	not	surprising	.
but	here	's	what	's	surprising	.
it	 scale 	 s 	 	in	the	same	way	 every 	 where 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	european	 count 	 ries 	 	,	but	you	do	it	in	japan	or	 chin 	 a 	 	or	colombia	,	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	with	the	same	kind	of	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	scale	to	the	same	degree	.
and	any	 infra 	 structure 	 	you	look	at	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	the	length	of	 road 	 s 	 	,	length	of	 electric 	 al 	 	lines	--	 any 	 thing 	 	you	look	at	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	scale	 scal 	 ing 	 	in	the	same	way	.
it	's	an	 integrate 	 d 	 	system	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	all	the	 plan 	 ning 	 	and	so	on	.
but	even	more	surprising	is	if	you	look	at	socio	-	economic	 quant 	 ities 	 	,	 quant 	 ities 	 	that	have	no	analog	in	biology	,	that	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	eight	to	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	top	one	is	 wage 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	 s 	 ize 	 	 plot 	 ted 	 	in	the	same	way	.
and	the	bottom	one	is	you	lot	--	super	-	 creative 	 s 	 	 plot 	 ted 	 	in	the	same	way	.
and	what	you	see	is	a	 scal 	 ing 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
but	most	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	 expo 	 n 	 ent 	 	,	the	analog	to	that	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	for	the	 metabol 	 ic 	 	rate	,	is	 big 	 ger 	 	than	one	--	it	's	about	1.15	to	1.2	.
here	it	is	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	that	the	 big 	 ger 	 	you	are	the	more	you	have	per	capita	,	 un 	 like 	 	biology	--	 high 	 er 	 	 wage 	 s 	 	,	more	super	-	creative	people	per	capita	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 big 	 ger 	 	,	more	 patent 	 s 	 	per	capita	,	more	crime	per	capita	.
and	we	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 every 	 thing 	 	:	more	 aid 	 s 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	flu	,	etc	.
and	here	,	they	're	all	 plot 	 ted 	 	together	.
just	to	show	you	what	we	 plot 	 ted 	 	,	here	is	income	,	gdp	--	gdp	of	the	city	--	crime	and	 patent 	 s 	 	all	on	one	graph	.
and	you	can	see	,	they	all	follow	the	same	line	.
and	here	's	the	 state 	 ment 	 	.
if	you	double	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	city	from	100,000	to	200,000	,	from	a	million	to	two	million	,	10	to	20	million	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	,	then	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	you	get	a	15	percent	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 wage 	 s 	 	,	wealth	,	number	of	 aid 	 s 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	number	of	police	,	 any 	 thing 	 	you	can	think	of	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	up	by	15	percent	,	and	you	have	a	15	percent	 saving 	 s 	 	on	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	no	doubt	,	is	the	reason	why	a	million	people	a	week	are	 gather 	 ing 	 	in	cities	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	think	that	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	like	creative	people	,	wealth	,	income	--	is	what	 attract 	 s 	 	them	,	 forget 	 ting 	 	about	the	 ug 	 ly 	 	and	the	bad	.
what	is	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	i	do	n't	have	time	to	tell	you	about	all	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	but	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	social	 network 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	universal	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	15	percent	rule	is	true	no	matter	where	you	are	on	the	planet	--	japan	,	chile	,	portugal	,	scotland	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.
 al 	 ways 	 	,	all	the	data	 show 	 s 	 	it	's	the	same	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	these	cities	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	universal	is	going	on	.
the	 universal 	 ity 	 	,	to	repeat	,	is	us	--	that	we	are	the	city	.
and	it	is	our	 interact 	 ions 	 	and	the	 cluster 	 ing 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 interact 	 ions 	 	.
so	there	it	is	,	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	if	it	is	 t 	 hose 	 	 network 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	structure	,	 un 	 like 	 	biology	,	which	had	 sub 	 linear 	 	 scal 	 ing 	 	,	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	of	scale	,	you	had	the	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	of	the	pace	of	life	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 big 	 ger 	 	.
if	it	's	social	 network 	 s 	 	with	super	-	linear	 scal 	 ing 	 	--	more	per	capita	--	then	the	 theor 	 y 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	you	 in 	 crease 	 	the	pace	of	life	.
the	 big 	 ger 	 	you	are	,	life	 get 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	.
on	the	left	is	the	heart	rate	 show 	 ing 	 	biology	.
on	the	right	is	the	speed	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	a	bunch	of	european	cities	,	 show 	 ing 	 	that	 in 	 crease 	 	.
 last 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	talk	about	growth	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	had	in	biology	,	just	to	repeat	.
 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	of	scale	 g 	 ave 	 	rise	to	 th 	 is 	 	 sigmoid 	 al 	 	behavior	.
you	grow	fast	and	then	stop	--	part	of	our	 resili 	 ence 	 	.
that	would	be	bad	for	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	and	cities	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	one	of	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	 theor 	 y 	 	is	that	if	you	have	super	-	linear	 scal 	 ing 	 	from	wealth	creation	and	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	then	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	you	get	,	from	the	same	 theor 	 y 	 	,	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	exponential	 curv 	 e 	 	--	 love 	 ly 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	if	you	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	data	,	it	 fit 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	with	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	cities	and	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	catch	,	and	the	catch	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	system	is	destined	to	collapse	.
and	it	's	destined	to	collapse	for	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	--	kind	of	malthusian	 reason 	 s 	 	--	that	you	run	out	of	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	how	do	you	avoid	that	?	well	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	before	.
what	we	do	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	grow	and	we	approach	the	collapse	,	a	major	 innov 	 ation 	 	 take 	 s 	 	place	and	we	start	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	we	start	over	 aga 	 in 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	approach	the	next	one	,	and	so	on	.
so	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 continu 	 ous 	 	cycle	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	in	order	to	sustain	growth	and	avoid	collapse	.
the	catch	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	to	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	you	have	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	.
so	the	image	is	that	we	're	not	 on 	 ly 	 	on	a	 tread 	 mill 	 	that	's	going	 fast 	 er 	 	,	but	we	have	to	change	the	 tread 	 mill 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	.
we	have	to	 accele 	 rate 	 	on	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
and	the	question	is	:	can	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	socio	-	economic	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	avoid	a	heart	attack	?
so	 last 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	finish	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	last	minute	or	two	 ask 	 ing 	 	about	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
see	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	they	scale	.
the	top	one	,	in	fact	,	is	walmart	on	the	right	.
it	's	the	same	plot	.
 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	income	and	 asset 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	company	 a 	 s 	 	 de 	 not 	 ed 	 	by	 it 	 s 	 	number	of	 employ 	 ees 	 	.
we	could	use	 sale 	 s 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	you	like	.
there	it	is	:	after	some	little	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	when	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 innov 	 ating 	 	,	they	scale	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	.
and	we	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	23,000	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	may	i	say	.
and	i	'm	 on 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	you	a	little	bit	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	is	 astonish 	 ing 	 	about	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	is	that	they	scale	 sub 	 linear 	 ly 	 	like	biology	,	 indic 	 ating 	 	that	they	're	 dominate 	 d 	 	,	not	by	super	-	linear	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	;	they	 be 	 come 	 	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	of	scale	.
in	that	 interpret 	 ation 	 	,	by	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	and	 administr 	 ation 	 	,	and	they	do	it	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	,	may	i	say	.
so	if	you	tell	me	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	some	company	,	some	small	company	,	i	could	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	walmart	.
if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 sub 	 linear 	 	 scal 	 ing 	 	,	the	 theor 	 y 	 	 say 	 s 	 	we	should	have	 sigmoid 	 al 	 	growth	.
there	's	walmart	.	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	 ver 	 y 	 	 sigmoid 	 al 	 	.
that	's	what	we	like	,	 hoc 	 key 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	.
but	you	notice	,	i	've	 cheat 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 on 	 ly 	 	gone	up	to	'94	.
let	's	go	up	to	2008	.
that	red	line	is	from	the	 theor 	 y 	 	.
so	if	i	'd	have	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	1994	,	i	could	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	what	walmart	would	be	now	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	 repeat 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	spectrum	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
there	they	are	.	that	's	23,000	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
they	all	start	looking	like	 hoc 	 key 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	,	they	all	bend	over	,	and	they	all	die	like	you	and	me	.
thank	you	.
