so	i	was	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	train	in	 transplant 	 ation 	 	under	two	great	 sur 	 gical 	 	 pioneer 	 s 	 	:	thomas	starzl	,	who	 perform 	 ed 	 	the	world	's	first	 success 	 ful 	 	liver	transplant	in	1967	,	and	 s 	 ir 	 	roy	calne	,	who	 perform 	 ed 	 	the	first	liver	transplant	in	the	u.k	.
in	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	year	.
i	 return 	 ed 	 	to	singapore	and	,	in	1990	,	 perform 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	's	first	 success 	 ful 	 	 cadaver 	 ic 	 	liver	transplant	procedure	,	but	against	all	 odd 	 s 	 	.
now	when	i	look	back	,	the	transplant	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	part	.
next	,	raising	the	money	to	fund	the	procedure	.
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	 challeng 	 ing 	 	part	was	to	 con 	 vince 	 	the	 regulat 	 ors 	 	--	a	matter	which	was	 debate 	 d 	 	in	the	parliament	--	that	a	young	female	surgeon	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	pioneer	for	her	country	.
but	20	 year 	 s 	 	on	,	my	patient	,	surinder	,	is	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	's	 long 	 est 	 	 surviv 	 ing 	 	 cadaver 	 ic 	 	liver	transplant	to	date	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	i	am	the	proud	 god 	 mother 	 	to	her	14	year	-	old	son	.
but	not	all	 patient 	 s 	 	on	the	transplant	wait	list	are	so	fortunate	.
the	truth	is	,	there	are	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	 en 	 ough 	 	donor	 organ 	 s 	 	to	go	around	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	demand	for	donor	 organ 	 s 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	to	rise	,	in	large	part	due	to	the	aging	population	,	the	supply	 ha 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	constant	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	100,000	men	,	women	and	children	are	on	the	 wait 	 ing 	 	list	for	donor	 organ 	 s 	 	,	and	more	than	a	dozen	die	each	day	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	lack	of	donor	 organ 	 s 	 	.
the	transplant	community	 ha 	 s 	 	 active 	 ly 	 	 campaign 	 ed 	 	in	organ	 don 	 ation 	 	.
and	the	gift	of	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 extend 	 ed 	 	from	brain	-	dead	 donor 	 s 	 	to	living	,	related	 donor 	 s 	 	--	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	who	might	 don 	 ate 	 	an	organ	or	a	part	of	an	organ	,	like	a	split	liver	graft	,	to	a	 relat 	 ive 	 	or	 love 	 d 	 	one	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	there	was	still	a	 di 	 re 	 	 short 	 age 	 	of	donor	 organ 	 s 	 	,	the	gift	of	life	was	then	 extend 	 ed 	 	from	living	,	related	 donor 	 s 	 	to	now	living	,	 un 	 related 	 	 donor 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	then	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	rise	to	unprecedented	and	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	moral	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	.
how	can	one	distinguish	a	 don 	 ation 	 	that	is	voluntary	and	 altruist 	 ic 	 	from	one	that	is	 force 	 d 	 	or	 coerc 	 ed 	 	from	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	 sub 	 mis 	 s 	 ive 	 	spouse	,	an	in	-	law	,	a	 serv 	 ant 	 	,	a	slave	,	an	 employ 	 ee 	 	?
where	and	how	can	we	draw	the	line	?
in	my	part	of	the	world	,	too	 man 	 y 	 	people	live	 be 	 low 	 	the	poverty	line	.
and	in	some	 area 	 s 	 	,	the	commercial	 gift 	 ing 	 	of	an	organ	in	 ex 	 change 	 	for	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	reward	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	a	 flourish 	 ing 	 	trade	in	living	,	 un 	 related 	 	 donor 	 s 	 	.
 short 	 ly 	 	after	i	 perform 	 ed 	 	the	first	liver	transplant	,	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	my	next	 assign 	 ment 	 	,	and	that	was	to	go	to	the	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	to	harvest	 organ 	 s 	 	from	 execute 	 d 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	at	the	time	.
 pregn 	 ancies 	 	are	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	happy	and	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	in	any	woman	's	life	.
but	my	 joy 	 ful 	 	period	was	 mar 	 red 	 	by	solemn	and	morbid	 thought 	 s 	 	--	 thought 	 s 	 	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	through	the	 pri 	 son 	 	's	high	-	security	death	row	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	route	to	take	me	to	the	 make 	 shift 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	.
and	at	each	time	,	i	would	feel	the	 chill 	 ing 	 	 star 	 es 	 	of	 condemn 	 ed 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	'	 eye 	 s 	 	follow	me	.
and	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	the	dilemma	of	 wa 	 king 	 	up	at	4:30	am	on	a	friday	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	to	the	 pri 	 son 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	down	,	 glove 	 d 	 	and	 scrub 	 bed 	 	,	ready	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	body	of	an	 execute 	 d 	 	prisoner	,	 re 	 move 	 	the	 organ 	 s 	 	and	then	transport	these	 organ 	 s 	 	to	the	recipient	hospital	and	then	graft	the	gift	of	life	to	a	recipient	the	same	afternoon	.
no	doubt	,	i	was	 inform 	 ed 	 	,	the	consent	had	 be 	 en 	 	 obtain 	 ed 	 	.
but	,	in	my	life	,	the	one	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	skill	that	i	had	was	now	 in 	 vo 	 king 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	conflict	--	conflict	ranging	from	 extrem 	 e 	 	sorrow	and	doubt	at	dawn	to	 celebr 	 atory 	 	joy	at	 en 	 graft 	 ing 	 	the	gift	of	life	at	 du 	 s 	 k 	 	.
in	my	team	,	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	one	or	two	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 tain 	 ted 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	experience	.
some	of	us	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	 sublimate 	 d 	 	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	 remain 	 ed 	 	the	same	.
i	was	 trouble 	 d 	 	that	the	 retr 	 ieval 	 	of	 organ 	 s 	 	from	 execute 	 d 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	was	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 moral 	 ly 	 	controversial	 a 	 s 	 	the	 harvest 	 ing 	 	of	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	from	human	 embryo 	 s 	 	.
and	in	my	mind	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 sur 	 gical 	 	pioneer	that	the	purpose	of	my	position	of	influence	was	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	to	speak	up	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	no	influence	.
it	made	me	wonder	if	there	could	be	a	better	way	--	a	way	to	 circum 	 vent 	 	death	and	yet	deliver	the	gift	of	life	that	might	 exponential 	 ly 	 	impact	 million 	 s 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
now	just	about	that	time	,	the	practice	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	from	big	to	small	,	from	wide	open	 incision 	 s 	 	to	 key 	 hole 	 	 procedure 	 s 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	 incision 	 s 	 	.
and	in	 transplant 	 ation 	 	,	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	 shift 	 ed 	 	from	whole	 organ 	 s 	 	to	 cell 	 s 	 	.
in	1988	,	at	the	university	of	minnesota	,	i	 particip 	 ated 	 	in	a	small	 s 	 eries 	 	of	whole	organ	 pan 	 cre 	 a 	 s 	 	 transplant 	 s 	 	.
i	 witness 	 ed 	 	the	technical	 difficult 	 y 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	inspired	in	my	mind	a	shift	from	 transplant 	 ing 	 	whole	 organ 	 s 	 	to	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 transplant 	 ing 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	why	not	take	the	individual	 cell 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 pan 	 cre 	 a 	 s 	 	--	the	 cell 	 s 	 	that	 secret 	 e 	 	insulin	to	cure	diabetes	--	and	transplant	these	 cell 	 s 	 	?	--	 technical 	 ly 	 	a	much	 simpl 	 er 	 	procedure	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	 grappl 	 e 	 	with	the	 complex 	 ities 	 	of	 transplant 	 ing 	 	a	whole	organ	.
and	at	that	time	,	stem	cell	research	had	 gain 	 ed 	 	 moment 	 um 	 	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	 isol 	 ation 	 	of	the	world	's	first	human	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	1990s	.
the	 observ 	 ation 	 	that	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	master	 cell 	 s 	 	,	could	give	rise	to	a	whole	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	different	cell	 type 	 s 	 	--	heart	 cell 	 s 	 	,	liver	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 pan 	 cre 	 atic 	 	 is 	 let 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	--	 capture 	 d 	 	the	attention	of	the	media	and	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	of	the	public	.
i	too	was	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	new	and	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	cell	technology	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	inspired	a	shift	in	my	 mind 	 set 	 	,	from	 transplant 	 ing 	 	whole	 organ 	 s 	 	to	 transplant 	 ing 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	i	focused	my	research	on	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	possible	source	for	cell	 transplant 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	 real 	 ize 	 	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	have	occupied	center	stage	,	 chief 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 pluri 	 pot 	 ency 	 	--	that	is	 the 	 ir 	 	ease	in	 different 	 i 	 ating 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	different	cell	 type 	 s 	 	.
but	the	moral	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	--	the	fact	that	these	 cell 	 s 	 	are	derived	from	five	-	day	old	human	 embryo 	 s 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 encourag 	 ed 	 	research	 in 	 to 	 	other	 type 	 s 	 	of	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
now	to	the	 ridicul 	 e 	 	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	i	inspired	my	lab	to	focus	on	what	i	thought	was	the	most	non	-	controversial	source	of	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	adipose	tissue	,	or	fat	,	 y 	 es 	 	fat	--	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	in	abundant	supply	--	you	and	i	,	i	think	,	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	get	rid	of	 any 	 way 	 	.
fat	-	derived	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	are	adult	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	adult	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	are	found	in	you	and	me	--	in	our	blood	,	in	our	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	,	in	our	fat	,	our	skin	and	other	 organ 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	fat	is	one	of	the	best	 source 	 s 	 	of	adult	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
but	adult	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	are	not	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	here	is	the	 limit 	 ation 	 	:	adult	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	are	mature	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	,	like	mature	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	these	 cell 	 s 	 	are	more	 restrict 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	thought	and	more	 restrict 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	and	are	 un 	 able 	 	to	give	rise	to	the	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 special 	 ized 	 	cell	 type 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	[	can	]	.
but	in	2007	,	two	 remark 	 able 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	,	shinya	yamanaka	of	japan	and	jamie	thomson	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	made	an	 astound 	 ing 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	.
they	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	adult	 cell 	 s 	 	,	taken	from	you	and	me	,	could	be	 re 	 programm 	 ed 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	 embryo 	 nic 	 	-	like	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	they	 term 	 ed 	 	ips	 cell 	 s 	 	,	or	induced	 pluri 	 potent 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	so	guess	what	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	around	the	world	and	in	the	 lab 	 s 	 	are	 rac 	 ing 	 	to	convert	aging	adult	 cell 	 s 	 	--	aging	adult	 cell 	 s 	 	from	you	and	me	--	they	are	 rac 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 program 	 	these	 cell 	 s 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	more	 use 	 ful 	 	ips	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	in	our	lab	,	we	are	focused	on	taking	fat	and	 re 	 programm 	 ing 	 	 mound 	 s 	 	of	fat	 in 	 to 	 	 fountain 	 s 	 	of	 youth 	 ful 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	--	 cell 	 s 	 	that	we	may	use	to	then	form	other	,	more	 special 	 ized 	 	,	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	one	day	may	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	cell	 transplant 	 s 	 	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	research	is	 success 	 ful 	 	,	it	may	then	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	need	to	research	and	sacrifice	human	 embryo 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	there	is	a	lot	of	hype	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	hope	that	the	promise	of	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	will	one	day	provide	 cure 	 s 	 	for	a	whole	range	of	 condition 	 s 	 	.
heart	disease	,	stroke	,	diabetes	,	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	 in 	 jury 	 	,	 mus 	 cular 	 	 dy 	 s 	 trophy 	 	,	 retina 	 l 	 	eye	 disease 	 s 	 	--	are	any	of	these	 condition 	 s 	 	relevant	,	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	to	you	?
in	may	2006	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
i	was	about	to	start	a	robotic	operation	,	but	 step 	 ping 	 	out	of	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	bright	and	 g 	 lar 	 ing 	 	 light 	 s 	 	of	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	my	left	visual	field	was	fast	 col 	 lap 	 s 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
 ear 	 lier 	 	that	week	,	i	had	taken	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	hard	knock	 dur 	 ing 	 	late	spring	 ski 	 ing 	 	--	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	fell	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	see	 float 	 ers 	 	and	 star 	 s 	 	,	which	i	 casual 	 ly 	 	 dismiss 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	too	much	high	-	altitude	 s 	 un 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	,	if	not	for	the	fact	that	i	was	in	reach	of	good	 sur 	 gical 	 	access	.
and	i	had	my	vision	 resto 	 red 	 	,	but	not	before	a	 pro 	 long 	 ed 	 	period	of	 con 	 val 	 esc 	 ence 	 	--	three	 month 	 s 	 	--	in	a	head	down	position	.
 th 	 is 	 	experience	taught	me	to	 empath 	 ize 	 	more	with	my	 patient 	 s 	 	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	with	 retina 	 l 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	.
37	million	people	 world 	 wide 	 	are	blind	,	and	127	million	more	suffer	from	 impair 	 ed 	 	vision	.
stem	cell	-	derived	 retina 	 l 	 	 transplant 	 s 	 	,	now	in	a	research	phase	,	may	one	day	 re 	 store 	 	vision	,	or	part	vision	,	to	 million 	 s 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	with	 retina 	 l 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	live	in	both	 challeng 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	world	population	 age 	 s 	 	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 rac 	 ing 	 	to	discover	new	ways	to	enhance	the	power	of	the	body	to	heal	 it 	 self 	 	through	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
it	is	a	fact	that	when	our	 organ 	 s 	 	or	 tissue 	 s 	 	are	 inju 	 red 	 	,	our	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 circul 	 ation 	 	.
and	these	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	then	float	in	the	 blood 	 stream 	 	and	hone	in	to	 damage 	 d 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 lease 	 	growth	 factor 	 s 	 	to	repair	the	 damage 	 d 	 	tissue	.

what	lies	 a 	 head 	 	?

1.1	million	americans	suffer	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	 year 	 ly 	 	.
