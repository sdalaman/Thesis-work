i	would	like	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	about	what	i	think	is	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 adventure 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 embark 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	,	which	is	the	quest	to	understand	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	our	place	in	it	.
my	own	interest	in	 th 	 is 	 	subject	,	and	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	it	,	 beg 	 an 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 accident 	 ally 	 	.
i	had	 b 	 ought 	 	a	copy	of	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	``	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	dr.	einstein	``	--	a	used	 paper 	 back 	 	from	a	 second 	 hand 	 	 book 	 store 	 	in	seattle	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	after	that	,	in	bangalore	,	i	was	 find 	 ing 	 	it	hard	to	fall	 a 	 sleep 	 	one	night	,	and	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	 think 	 ing 	 	it	would	put	me	to	sleep	in	10	 minute 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	i	read	it	from	 mid 	 night 	 	to	five	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	in	one	shot	.
and	i	was	left	with	 th 	 is 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	awe	and	 exhila 	 ration 	 	at	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	our	own	ability	to	understand	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	.
and	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	left	me	yet	.
that	 feel 	 ing 	 	was	the	trigger	for	me	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	my	 care 	 er 	 	--	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	engineer	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	science	writer	--	so	that	i	could	 par 	 take 	 	in	the	joy	of	science	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	joy	of	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	it	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	 al 	 so 	 	led	me	to	a	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	of	 sort 	 s 	 	,	to	go	 liter 	 ally 	 	to	the	 end 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	to	see	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	 detect 	 ors 	 	,	 instrument 	 s 	 	that	people	are	building	,	or	have	built	,	in	order	to	 prob 	 e 	 	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	in	 great 	 er 	 	and	 great 	 er 	 	detail	.
so	it	took	me	from	 place 	 s 	 	like	chile	--	the	atacama	desert	in	chile	--	to	siberia	,	to	 under 	 ground 	 	 mine 	 s 	 	in	the	japanese	alps	,	in	 north 	 ern 	 	america	,	all	the	way	to	antarctica	and	even	to	the	south	pole	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	i	would	like	to	share	with	you	some	 image 	 s 	 	,	some	 st 	 ories 	 	of	these	 trip 	 s 	 	.
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	 document 	 ing 	 	the	 effort 	 s 	 	of	some	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 in 	 trepid 	 	men	and	women	who	are	 put 	 ting 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	at	 time 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	at	 s 	 take 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	some	 ver 	 y 	 	remote	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	 place 	 s 	 	so	that	they	may	gather	the	 faint 	 est 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	from	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	in	order	for	us	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	i	first	begin	with	a	pie	chart	--	and	i	promise	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	pie	chart	in	the	whole	 present 	 ation 	 	--	but	it	 set 	 s 	 	up	the	state	of	our	knowledge	of	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	.
all	the	 the 	 ories 	 	in	physics	that	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	explain	what	is	 call 	 ed 	 	normal	matter	--	the	stuff	that	we	're	all	made	of	--	and	that	's	four	percent	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 astronomer 	 s 	 	and	 cosmo 	 logists 	 	and	 physicist 	 s 	 	think	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	matter	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	which	 make 	 s 	 	up	23	percent	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	energy	,	which	 permeate 	 s 	 	the	fabric	of	space	-	time	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	up	 an 	 other 	 	73	percent	.
so	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	pie	chart	,	96	percent	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	our	exploration	of	it	,	is	 un 	 known 	 	or	not	well	 under 	 stood 	 	.
and	most	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	that	i	went	to	see	are	in	some	way	 address 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	these	two	 t 	 win 	 	 myster 	 ies 	 	of	dark	matter	and	dark	energy	.
i	will	take	you	first	to	an	 under 	 ground 	 	mine	in	 north 	 ern 	 	minnesota	where	people	are	looking	for	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	matter	.
and	the	idea	here	is	that	they	are	looking	for	a	sign	of	a	dark	matter	particle	hitting	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 detect 	 ors 	 	.
and	the	reason	why	they	have	to	go	 under 	 ground 	 	is	that	,	if	you	did	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	on	the	surface	of	the	earth	,	the	same	experiment	would	be	 swamp 	 ed 	 	by	 signal 	 s 	 	that	could	be	 create 	 d 	 	by	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	,	 ambi 	 ent 	 	radio	activity	,	even	our	own	bodies	.	you	might	not	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	but	even	our	own	bodies	are	 radio 	 active 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	disturb	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	.
so	they	go	deep	 in 	 side 	 	 mine 	 s 	 	to	find	a	kind	of	 environment 	 al 	 	silence	that	will	allow	them	to	hear	the	ping	of	a	dark	matter	particle	hitting	 the 	 ir 	 	 detect 	 or 	 	.
and	i	went	to	see	one	of	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	you	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	see	it	,	and	the	reason	for	that	is	it	's	 entire 	 ly 	 	dark	in	there	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cavern	that	was	left	 be 	 hind 	 	by	the	 min 	 ers 	 	who	left	 th 	 is 	 	mine	in	1960	.
and	 physicist 	 s 	 	came	and	 start 	 ed 	 	using	it	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	1980s	.
and	the	 min 	 ers 	 	in	the	early	part	of	the	last	century	 work 	 ed 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	in	 candle 	 light 	 	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	would	see	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	mine	,	half	a	mile	 under 	 ground 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	largest	 under 	 ground 	 	 lab 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
and	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	're	looking	for	dark	matter	.
there	is	 an 	 other 	 	way	to	search	for	dark	matter	,	which	is	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
if	dark	matter	 exist 	 s 	 	in	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	,	then	these	 particle 	 s 	 	should	be	 s 	 mash 	 ing 	 	together	and	producing	other	 particle 	 s 	 	that	we	know	about	--	one	of	them	 be 	 ing 	 	 neutrino 	 s 	 	.
and	 neutrino 	 s 	 	you	can	detect	by	the	signature	they	 leav 	 e 	 	when	they	hit	water	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
when	a	neutrino	 hit 	 s 	 	a	water	molecule	it	 emit 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	blue	light	,	a	flash	of	blue	light	,	and	by	looking	for	 th 	 is 	 	blue	light	,	you	can	 essential 	 ly 	 	understand	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	neutrino	and	then	,	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	dark	matter	that	might	have	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	neutrino	.
but	you	need	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 volume 	 s 	 	of	water	in	order	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	need	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 mega 	 ton 	 s 	 	of	water	--	 al 	 most 	 	a	 giga 	 ton 	 	of	water	--	in	order	to	have	any	chance	of	 catch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	neutrino	.
and	where	in	the	world	would	you	find	 s 	 uch 	 	water	?
well	the	russians	have	a	tank	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 back 	 yard 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	lake	baikal	.
it	is	the	largest	lake	in	the	world	.	it	's	800	km	long	.
it	's	about	40	to	50	km	wide	in	most	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	one	to	two	 kilometer 	 s 	 	deep	.
and	what	the	russians	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	they	're	building	these	 detect 	 ors 	 	and	 immers 	 ing 	 	them	about	a	kilometer	 be 	 neath 	 	the	surface	of	the	lake	so	that	they	can	watch	for	these	 flash 	 es 	 	of	blue	light	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	scene	that	 greet 	 ed 	 	me	when	i	 land 	 ed 	 	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	lake	baikal	in	the	peak	of	the	siberian	winter	.
the	lake	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	.
and	the	line	of	black	 dot 	 s 	 	that	you	see	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	that	's	the	ice	camp	where	the	 physicist 	 s 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	.
the	reason	why	they	have	to	work	in	winter	is	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	the	money	to	work	in	summer	and	spring	,	which	,	if	they	did	that	,	they	would	need	 ship 	 s 	 	and	 submersible 	 s 	 	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
so	they	wait	 un 	 til 	 	winter	--	the	lake	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	over	--	and	they	use	 th 	 is 	 	meter	-	thick	ice	 a 	 s 	 	a	platform	on	which	to	establish	 the 	 ir 	 	ice	camp	and	do	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	russians	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	ice	in	the	peak	of	the	siberian	winter	.
they	have	to	drill	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	ice	,	 d 	 ive 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	--	cold	,	cold	water	--	to	get	hold	of	the	instrument	,	 br 	 ing 	 	it	up	,	do	any	 repair 	 s 	 	and	maintenance	that	they	need	to	do	,	put	it	back	and	get	out	before	the	ice	 melt 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	phase	of	solid	ice	 last 	 s 	 	for	two	 month 	 s 	 	and	it	's	full	of	 crack 	 s 	 	.
and	you	have	to	imagine	,	there	's	an	entire	sea	-	like	lake	 under 	 neath 	 	,	moving	.
i	still	do	n't	understand	 th 	 is 	 	one	russian	man	 work 	 ing 	 	in	his	bare	chest	,	but	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	hard	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	.
and	these	people	,	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	people	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	looking	for	 particle 	 s 	 	that	may	or	may	not	exist	.
and	they	have	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	to	it	.
and	just	to	give	you	an	idea	,	they	have	 s 	 pent 	 	20	million	over	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	harsh	 condition 	 s 	 	.
they	work	on	a	 shoe 	 string 	 	budget	.
the	 toilet 	 s 	 	there	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	ground	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	a	 wood 	 en 	 	 s 	 hack 	 	.
and	it	's	that	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	but	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	every	year	.
from	siberia	to	the	atacama	desert	in	chile	,	to	see	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 tele 	 scope 	 	is	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 astronomer 	 s 	 	do	--	they	name	 the 	 ir 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 imagin 	 ative 	 ly 	 	.
i	can	tell	you	for	a	fact	,	that	the	next	one	that	they	're	 plan 	 ning 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	large	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
and	you	would	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	but	the	one	after	that	is	going	to	be	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	large	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
but	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	it	's	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	piece	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
these	are	four	8.2	meter	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	 stud 	 y 	 	how	the	expansion	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	changing	with	time	.
and	the	more	you	understand	that	,	the	better	you	would	understand	what	 th 	 is 	 	dark	energy	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	made	of	is	all	about	.
and	one	piece	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	that	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 a 	 s 	 	 regard 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	is	the	mirror	.
each	mirror	,	there	are	four	of	them	,	is	made	of	a	single	piece	of	glass	,	a	 monolith 	 ic 	 	piece	of	high	-	tech	ceramic	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	ground	down	and	 polish 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 uch 	 	 accu 	 racy 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	understand	what	that	is	is	[	to	]	imagine	a	city	like	paris	,	with	all	 it 	 s 	 	 building 	 s 	 	and	the	eiffel	tower	,	if	you	grind	down	paris	to	that	kind	of	 accu 	 racy 	 	,	you	would	be	left	with	 bump 	 s 	 	that	are	one	millimeter	high	.
and	that	's	the	kind	of	 polish 	 ing 	 	that	these	 mirror 	 s 	 	have	 endur 	 ed 	 	.
an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	set	of	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	view	of	the	same	.
the	reason	why	you	have	to	build	these	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	the	atacama	desert	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	high	altitude	desert	.
the	dry	air	is	 re 	 ally 	 	good	for	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	cloud	cover	is	 be 	 low 	 	the	 summ 	 it 	 	of	these	 mountain 	 s 	 	so	that	the	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	have	about	300	 day 	 s 	 	of	clear	 ski 	 es 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	take	you	to	antarctica	.
i	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	time	on	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	's	final	 front 	 ier 	 	.
some	of	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	some	of	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	antarctica	.
i	was	there	to	view	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	long	-	 dur 	 ation 	 	balloon	flight	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 take 	 s 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	and	 instrument 	 s 	 	all	the	way	to	the	upper	atmosphere	,	the	upper	 strato 	 sphere 	 	,	40	km	up	.
and	that	's	where	they	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	balloon	,	the	 pay 	 load 	 	,	is	 br 	 ought 	 	down	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	us	 land 	 ing 	 	on	the	ross	ice	shelf	in	antarctica	.
that	's	an	american	c	-	17	 car 	 go 	 	plane	that	flew	us	from	new	zealand	to	mcmurdo	in	antarctica	.
and	here	we	are	about	to	board	our	bus	.
and	i	do	n't	know	if	you	can	read	the	 letter 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	ivan	the	terribus	.	``
and	that	's	taking	us	to	mcmurdo	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	scene	that	 greet 	 s 	 	you	in	mcmurdo	.
and	you	 bare 	 ly 	 	might	be	able	to	make	out	 th 	 is 	 	hut	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	hut	was	built	by	robert	falcon	scott	and	his	men	when	they	first	came	to	antarctica	on	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	to	go	to	the	south	pole	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	cold	,	the	entire	 content 	 s 	 	of	that	hut	is	still	 a 	 s 	 	they	left	it	,	with	the	 remnant 	 s 	 	of	the	last	meal	they	 cook 	 ed 	 	still	there	.
it	's	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	place	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	mcmurdo	 it 	 self 	 	.	about	a	thousand	people	work	here	in	summer	,	and	about	200	in	winter	when	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	dark	for	six	 month 	 s 	 	.
i	was	here	to	see	the	launch	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	type	of	instrument	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 cosm 	 ic 	 	ray	experiment	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	all	the	way	to	the	upper	-	 strato 	 sphere 	 	to	an	altitude	of	40	km	.
what	i	want	you	to	imagine	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	two	 ton 	 s 	 	in	weight	.
so	you	're	using	a	balloon	to	carry	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	two	 ton 	 s 	 	all	the	way	to	an	altitude	of	40	km	.
and	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	the	 technician 	 s 	 	,	the	 physicist 	 s 	 	have	all	got	to	assemble	on	the	ross	ice	shelf	,	 be 	 cause 	 	antarctica	--	i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	--	but	it	's	one	of	the	most	 favor 	 able 	 	 place 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	these	balloon	 launch 	 es 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	weather	.
the	weather	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	summer	,	and	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	200	ft	of	ice	.
and	there	's	a	 volcan 	 o 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 glaci 	 ers 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	.
and	what	they	have	to	do	is	they	have	to	assemble	the	entire	balloon	--	the	fabric	,	 parachut 	 e 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	--	on	the	ice	and	then	fill	it	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
and	that	process	 take 	 s 	 	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	.
and	the	weather	can	change	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 put 	 ting 	 	together	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 assem 	 bly 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	here	they	are	 lay 	 ing 	 	down	the	balloon	fabric	 be 	 hind 	 	,	which	is	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	two	 truck 	 s 	 	you	see	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	carry	12	 tank 	 s 	 	each	of	 compress 	 ed 	 	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
now	,	in	case	the	weather	 change 	 s 	 	before	the	launch	,	they	have	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	pack	 every 	 thing 	 	back	up	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	boxes	and	take	it	out	back	to	mcmurdo	station	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	balloon	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	launch	two	 ton 	 s 	 	of	weight	,	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	huge	balloon	.
the	fabric	 al 	 one 	 	 weigh 	 s 	 	two	 ton 	 s 	 	.
in	order	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	the	weight	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	,	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	thin	 a 	 s 	 	a	sandwich	 wrap 	 per 	 	.
and	if	they	have	to	pack	it	back	,	they	have	to	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	boxes	and	stamp	on	it	so	that	it	 fit 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	box	 aga 	 in 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	,	when	they	did	it	first	,	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	texas	.
here	,	they	ca	n't	do	it	with	the	kind	 shoe 	 s 	 	they	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	,	so	they	have	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	off	,	get	 bare 	 foot 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	boxes	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	cold	,	and	do	that	kind	of	work	.
that	's	the	kind	of	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	these	people	have	.
here	's	the	balloon	 be 	 ing 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	,	and	you	can	see	it	's	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	sight	.
here	's	a	scene	that	 show 	 s 	 	you	the	balloon	and	the	 pay 	 load 	 	end	-	to	-	end	.
so	the	balloon	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	on	the	left	-	hand	side	,	and	the	fabric	 actual 	 ly 	 	 run 	 s 	 	all	the	way	to	the	middle	where	there	's	a	piece	of	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	 explosive 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	a	 parachut 	 e 	 	,	and	then	the	 parachut 	 e 	 	is	then	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 pay 	 load 	 	.
and	remember	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	wiring	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	people	in	 extrem 	 e 	 	cold	,	in	sub	-	zero	 temperature 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	about	15	 k 	 g 	 	of	 cloth 	 ing 	 	and	stuff	,	but	they	have	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 glove 	 s 	 	off	in	order	to	do	that	.
and	i	would	like	to	share	with	you	a	launch	.
radio	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 re 	 lease 	 	the	balloon	,	 re 	 lease 	 	the	balloon	,	 re 	 lease 	 	the	balloon	.
anil	ananthaswamy	:	and	i	'll	 final 	 ly 	 	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	two	 image 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 observ 	 atory 	 	in	the	himalayas	,	in	ladakh	in	india	.
and	the	thing	i	want	you	to	look	at	here	is	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	on	the	right	-	hand	side	.
and	on	the	far	left	there	is	a	400	year	-	old	buddhist	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	close	-	up	of	the	buddhist	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	.
and	i	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	the	 juxta 	 position 	 	of	these	two	enormous	 discipline 	 s 	 	that	 human 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	.
one	is	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	the	other	one	is	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	our	 in 	 terior 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	both	 requir 	 e 	 	silence	of	some	sort	.
and	what	 s 	 truck 	 	me	was	every	place	that	i	went	to	to	see	these	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	the	 astronomer 	 s 	 	and	 cosmo 	 logists 	 	are	in	search	of	a	certain	kind	of	silence	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	silence	from	radio	 poll 	 ution 	 	or	light	 poll 	 ution 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	that	,	if	we	destroy	these	silent	 place 	 s 	 	on	earth	,	we	will	be	 s 	 tuck 	 	on	a	planet	 with 	 out 	 	the	ability	to	look	 out 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	will	not	be	able	to	understand	the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	come	from	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
thank	you	.
