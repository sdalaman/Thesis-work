is	there	 any 	 thing 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	about	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	?
there	is	.
we	're	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	with	fully	 develop 	 ed 	 	moral	 sentiment 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 moral 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	social	 creature 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	know	why	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	am	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
it	was	all	due	to	 th 	 is 	 	woman	,	sister	mary	marastela	,	 al 	 so 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	my	mom	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	 al 	 tar 	 	boy	,	i	 breath 	 ed 	 	in	a	lot	of	incense	,	and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	say	 phrase 	 s 	 	in	latin	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	had	time	to	think	about	 whet 	 her 	 	my	mother	's	top	-	down	 moral 	 ity 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	 every 	 body 	 	.
i	saw	that	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	religious	and	non	-	religious	 we 	 re 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
i	thought	,	 may 	 be 	 	there	's	some	 earth 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	for	moral	 decision 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	further	than	to	say	our	 brain 	 s 	 	make	us	moral	.
i	want	to	know	if	there	's	a	 chemist 	 ry 	 	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
i	want	to	know	if	there	was	a	moral	molecule	.
after	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	i	found	it	.
would	you	like	to	see	it	?	i	 br 	 ought 	 	some	with	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	syringe	 contain 	 s 	 	the	moral	molecule	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
so	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	is	a	simple	and	ancient	molecule	found	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 mammal 	 s 	 	.
in	 rod 	 ent 	 s 	 	,	it	was	known	to	make	 mother 	 s 	 	care	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	and	in	some	 creature 	 s 	 	,	 allow 	 ed 	 	for	 toler 	 ation 	 	of	 burrow 	 mate 	 s 	 	.
but	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	known	to	facilitate	birth	and	 breast 	 feed 	 ing 	 	in	women	,	and	is	released	by	both	 s 	 ex 	 es 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	.
so	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	might	be	the	moral	molecule	.
i	did	what	most	of	us	do	--	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	on	some	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	told	me	,	``	paul	,	that	is	the	world	's	 stupid 	 ist 	 	idea	.
it	is	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 on 	 ly 	 	a	female	molecule	.
it	ca	n't	be	that	 import 	 ant 	 	.	``
but	i	 counter 	 ed 	 	,	``	well	men	's	 brain 	 s 	 	make	 th 	 is 	 	too	.
there	must	be	a	reason	why	.	``
but	he	was	right	,	it	was	a	stupid	idea	.
but	it	was	 test 	 ably 	 	stupid	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	thought	i	could	design	an	experiment	to	see	if	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	made	people	moral	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	was	n't	so	easy	.
first	of	all	,	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	is	a	 s 	 hy 	 	molecule	.
 base 	 line 	 	 level 	 s 	 	are	near	zero	,	 with 	 out 	 	some	 stimul 	 us 	 	to	cause	 it 	 s 	 	 re 	 lease 	 	.
and	when	it	's	 produce 	 d 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	three	-	minute	half	-	life	,	and	 de 	 grade 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	at	room	temperature	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	would	have	to	cause	a	 s 	 urge 	 	of	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	,	have	to	grab	it	fast	and	keep	it	cold	.
i	think	i	can	do	that	.
now	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	is	 produce 	 d 	 	both	in	the	brain	and	in	the	blood	,	so	i	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	 with 	 out 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 neuro 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
then	i	had	to	measure	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
so	taking	on	 moral 	 ity 	 	with	a	capital	m	is	a	huge	project	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 small 	 er 	 	.
i	 stud 	 ied 	 	one	single	virtue	:	 trust 	 worth 	 iness 	 	.
why	?	i	had	 show 	 n 	 	in	the	early	2000s	that	 count 	 ries 	 	with	a	 high 	 er 	 	proportion	of	 trust 	 worthy 	 	people	are	more	 prosper 	 ous 	 	.
so	in	these	 count 	 ries 	 	,	more	economic	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	occur	and	more	wealth	is	 create 	 d 	 	,	 allevi 	 ating 	 	poverty	.
so	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	are	by	and	large	low	trust	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	if	i	 under 	 stood 	 	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	of	 trust 	 worth 	 iness 	 	,	i	might	help	 allevi 	 ate 	 	poverty	.
but	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	a	skeptic	.
i	do	n't	want	to	just	ask	people	,	``	are	you	 trust 	 worthy 	 	?	``
so	 in 	 stead 	 	i	use	the	jerry	maguire	approach	to	research	.
if	you	're	so	virtuous	,	show	me	the	money	.
so	what	we	do	in	my	lab	is	we	tempt	people	with	virtue	and	vice	by	using	money	.
let	me	show	you	how	we	do	that	.
so	we	recruit	some	people	for	an	experiment	.
they	all	get	$	10	if	they	agree	to	show	up	.
we	give	them	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 instruct 	 ion 	 	,	and	we	never	ever	deceive	them	.
then	we	match	them	in	 pair 	 s 	 	by	computer	.
and	in	that	pair	,	one	person	 get 	 s 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	do	you	want	to	give	up	some	of	your	$	10	you	 earn 	 ed 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	here	and	ship	it	to	 some 	 one 	 	else	in	the	lab	?	``
the	trick	is	you	ca	n't	see	them	,	you	ca	n't	talk	to	them	.
you	 on 	 ly 	 	do	it	one	time	.
now	 what 	 ever 	 	you	give	up	 get 	 s 	 	 triple 	 d 	 	in	the	other	person	's	account	.
you	're	going	to	make	them	a	lot	 wealth 	 ier 	 	.
and	they	get	a	 mess 	 age 	 	by	computer	 say 	 ing 	 	person	one	 s 	 ent 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	amount	of	money	.
do	you	want	to	keep	it	all	,	or	do	you	want	to	 s 	 end 	 	some	amount	back	?
so	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	for	minute	.
you	're	going	to	 s 	 it 	 	on	these	hard	 chair 	 s 	 	for	an	hour	and	a	half	.
some	mad	scientist	is	going	to	jab	your	arm	with	a	needle	and	take	four	 tube 	 s 	 	of	blood	.
and	now	you	want	me	to	give	up	 th 	 is 	 	money	and	ship	it	to	a	 strange 	 r 	 	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	birth	of	vampire	 economic 	 s 	 	.
make	a	decision	and	give	me	some	blood	.
so	in	fact	,	 experiment 	 al 	 	 economist 	 s 	 	had	run	 th 	 is 	 	test	around	the	world	,	and	for	much	 high 	 er 	 	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	view	was	that	the	measure	from	the	first	person	to	the	second	was	a	measure	of	trust	,	and	the	transfer	from	the	second	person	back	to	the	first	 measur 	 ed 	 	 trust 	 worth 	 iness 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	 economist 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 flummox 	 ed 	 	on	why	the	second	person	would	ever	return	any	money	.
they	 assum 	 ed 	 	money	is	good	,	why	not	keep	it	all	?
that	's	not	what	we	found	.
we	found	90	percent	of	the	first	decision	-	makers	 s 	 ent 	 	money	,	and	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 receiv 	 ed 	 	money	,	95	percent	 return 	 ed 	 	some	of	it	.
but	why	?
well	by	 measur 	 ing 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	we	found	that	the	more	money	the	second	person	 receiv 	 ed 	 	,	the	more	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 produce 	 d 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	,	and	the	more	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	on	board	,	the	more	money	they	 return 	 ed 	 	.
so	we	have	a	biology	of	 trust 	 worth 	 iness 	 	.
but	wait	.	what	's	wrong	with	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	?
two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	is	that	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	the	body	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 isol 	 ation 	 	.
so	we	 measur 	 ed 	 	nine	other	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	interact	with	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	,	but	they	did	n't	have	any	effect	.
but	the	second	is	that	i	still	 on 	 ly 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 direct 	 	relationship	between	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	and	 trust 	 worth 	 iness 	 	.
i	did	n't	know	for	 s 	 ure 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	 trust 	 worth 	 iness 	 	.
so	to	make	the	experiment	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	'd	have	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	and	 manipul 	 ate 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
i	used	 every 	 thing 	 	short	of	a	drill	to	get	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	own	brain	.
and	i	found	i	could	do	it	with	a	 na 	 s 	 al 	 	 inhal 	 er 	 	.
so	 a 	 long 	 	with	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	zurich	,	we	put	200	men	on	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	or	 place 	 bo 	 	,	had	that	same	trust	test	with	money	,	and	we	found	that	 t 	 hose 	 	on	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	more	trust	,	we	can	more	than	double	the	number	of	people	who	 s 	 ent 	 	all	 the 	 ir 	 	money	to	a	 strange 	 r 	 	--	all	 with 	 out 	 	 alter 	 ing 	 	mood	or	cognition	.
so	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	is	the	trust	molecule	,	but	is	it	the	moral	molecule	?
using	the	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	 inhal 	 er 	 	,	we	ran	more	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
we	 show 	 ed 	 	that	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	 in 	 fusion 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	in	 uni 	 lateral 	 	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	 transfer 	 s 	 	by	80	percent	.
we	 show 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 don 	 ations 	 	to	 char 	 ity 	 	by	50	percent	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 investigate 	 d 	 	non	-	pharmacologic	ways	to	raise	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
these	include	 mass 	 age 	 	,	 danc 	 ing 	 	and	 pray 	 ing 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	my	mom	was	happy	about	that	last	one	.
and	 when 	 ever 	 	we	raise	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	,	people	 will 	 ing 	 ly 	 	open	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 wallet 	 s 	 	and	share	money	with	 strange 	 rs 	 	.
but	why	do	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	feel	like	when	your	brain	is	 flood 	 ed 	 	with	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	?
to	investigate	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	we	ran	an	experiment	where	we	had	people	watch	a	video	of	a	father	and	his	four	year	-	old	son	,	and	his	son	 ha 	 s 	 	terminal	brain	cancer	.
after	they	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	video	,	we	had	them	rate	 the 	 ir 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	took	blood	before	and	after	to	measure	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
the	change	in	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	 predict 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 empath 	 y 	 	.
so	it	's	 empath 	 y 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	connect	to	other	people	.
it	's	 empath 	 y 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	help	other	people	.
it	's	 empath 	 y 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	moral	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	idea	is	not	new	.
a	then	 un 	 known 	 	 philosoph 	 er 	 	named	adam	smith	wrote	a	book	in	1759	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	moral	 sentiment 	 s 	 	.	``
in	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	smith	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	we	are	moral	 creature 	 s 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	top	-	down	reason	,	but	for	a	bottom	-	up	reason	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	we	're	social	 creature 	 s 	 	,	so	we	share	the	 emotion 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	if	i	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 hurt 	 s 	 	you	,	i	feel	that	pain	.
so	i	tend	to	avoid	that	.
if	i	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	happy	,	i	get	to	share	your	joy	.
so	i	tend	to	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	adam	smith	who	,	17	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	would	write	a	little	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	wealth	of	 nation 	 s 	 	``	--	the	 found 	 ing 	 	document	of	 economic 	 s 	 	.
but	he	was	,	in	fact	,	a	moral	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	and	he	was	right	on	why	we	're	moral	.
i	just	found	the	molecule	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
but	 know 	 ing 	 	that	molecule	is	 valu 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	how	to	turn	up	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	and	what	 turn 	 s 	 	it	off	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	why	we	see	 immoral 	 ity 	 	.
so	to	investigate	 immoral 	 ity 	 	,	let	me	 br 	 ing 	 	you	back	now	to	1980	.
i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	at	a	gas	station	on	the	 out 	 skirt 	 s 	 	of	santa	barbara	,	california	.
you	 s 	 it 	 	in	a	gas	station	all	day	,	you	see	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	and	 immoral 	 ity 	 	,	let	me	tell	you	.
so	one	sunday	afternoon	,	a	man	 walk 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	 cash 	 ier 	 	's	booth	with	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 jewel 	 ry 	 	box	.
 open 	 s 	 	it	up	and	there	's	a	pearl	 neck 	 lace 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	was	in	the	men	's	room	.
i	just	found	 th 	 is 	 	.	what	do	you	think	we	should	do	with	it	?	``
``	i	do	n't	know	,	put	it	in	the	lost	and	found	.	``
``	well	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	.
we	have	to	find	the	owner	for	 th 	 is 	 	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	yea	.	``
so	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	what	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	the	phone	 ring 	 s 	 	.
and	a	man	 say 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 ly 	 	,	``	i	was	in	your	gas	station	a	while	ago	,	and	i	 b 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 jewel 	 ry 	 	for	my	wife	,	and	i	ca	n't	find	it	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	pearl	 neck 	 lace 	 	?	``	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.	``
``	 he 	 y 	 	,	a	guy	just	found	it	.	``
``	oh	,	you	're	saving	my	life	.	here	's	my	phone	number	.
tell	that	guy	to	wait	half	an	hour	.
i	'll	be	there	and	i	'll	give	him	a	$	200	reward	.	``
great	,	so	i	tell	the	guy	,	``	look	,	relax	.
get	 your 	 self 	 	a	fat	reward	.	life	's	good	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	ca	n't	do	it	.
i	have	 th 	 is 	 	job	interview	in	galena	in	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	i	need	 th 	 is 	 	job	,	i	've	got	to	go	.	``
 aga 	 in 	 	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	what	do	you	think	we	should	do	?	``
i	'm	in	high	school	.	i	have	no	idea	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	hold	it	for	you	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	so	nice	,	let	's	split	the	reward	.	``
i	'll	give	you	the	 jewel 	 ry 	 	,	you	give	me	a	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	when	the	guy	 come 	 s 	 	...	``	you	see	it	.	i	was	 con 	 ned 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	classic	con	 call 	 ed 	 	the	pigeon	drop	,	and	i	was	the	pigeon	.
so	the	way	 man 	 y 	 	 con 	 s 	 	work	is	not	that	the	 con 	 man 	 	 get 	 s 	 	the	victim	to	trust	him	,	it	's	that	he	 show 	 s 	 	he	 trust 	 s 	 	the	victim	.
now	we	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
the	victim	's	brain	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	,	and	you	're	 open 	 ing 	 	up	your	wallet	or	 pur 	 s 	 e 	 	,	giving	away	the	money	.
so	who	are	these	people	who	 manipul 	 ate 	 	our	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	 system 	 s 	 	?
we	found	,	 test 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	,	that	five	percent	of	the	population	do	n't	 re 	 lease 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	on	 stimul 	 us 	 	.
so	if	you	trust	them	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	do	n't	 re 	 lease 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
if	there	's	money	on	the	table	,	they	keep	it	all	.
so	there	's	a	technical	word	for	these	people	in	my	lab	.
we	call	them	 bastard 	 s 	 	.
these	are	not	people	you	want	to	have	a	beer	with	.
they	have	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	 psychopath 	 s 	 	.
now	there	are	other	ways	the	system	can	be	 inhibit 	 ed 	 	.
one	is	through	 im 	 proper 	 	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	've	 stud 	 ied 	 	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 abuse 	 d 	 	women	,	and	about	half	 t 	 hose 	 	do	n't	 re 	 lease 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	on	 stimul 	 us 	 	.
you	need	 en 	 ough 	 	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	system	to	develop	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	high	stress	 inhibit 	 s 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
so	we	all	know	 th 	 is 	 	,	when	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 stress 	 ed 	 	out	,	we	're	not	 act 	 ing 	 	our	best	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	way	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	is	 inhibit 	 ed 	 	,	which	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	--	through	the	action	of	testosterone	.
so	we	,	in	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	have	 administer 	 ed 	 	testosterone	to	men	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	sharing	money	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 self 	 ish 	 	.
but	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	high	testosterone	 male 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	use	 the 	 ir 	 	own	money	to	punish	 other 	 s 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 self 	 ish 	 	.
now	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	it	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	our	own	biology	,	we	have	the	 y 	 in 	 	and	 y 	 ang 	 	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
we	have	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	that	 connect 	 s 	 	us	to	 other 	 s 	 	,	 make 	 s 	 	us	feel	what	they	feel	.
and	we	have	testosterone	.
and	men	have	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	testosterone	 a 	 s 	 	women	,	so	men	do	 th 	 is 	 	more	than	women	--	we	have	testosterone	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	want	to	punish	people	who	 behav 	 e 	 	 immoral 	 ly 	 	.
we	do	n't	need	god	or	government	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	what	to	do	.
it	's	all	 in 	 side 	 	of	us	.
so	you	may	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	:	these	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	do	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 app 	 ly 	 	to	real	life	?
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	that	too	.
so	i	've	gone	out	of	the	lab	to	see	if	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 hold 	 s 	 	in	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	last	summer	,	i	 attend 	 ed 	 	a	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	in	southern	england	.
200	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	victorian	 man 	 s 	 ion 	 	.
i	did	n't	know	a	single	person	.
and	i	drove	up	in	my	 rent 	 ed 	 	vauxhall	.
and	i	took	out	a	 cent 	 rifuge 	 	and	dry	ice	and	 needle 	 s 	 	and	 tube 	 s 	 	.
and	i	took	blood	from	the	 brid 	 e 	 	and	the	groom	and	the	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	party	and	the	family	and	the	 friend 	 s 	 	before	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	after	the	 vow 	 s 	 	.
and	guess	what	?
 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 s 	 	cause	a	 re 	 lease 	 	of	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	,	but	they	do	so	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	way	.
who	is	the	center	of	the	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	solar	system	?
the	 brid 	 e 	 	.
she	had	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
who	 love 	 s 	 	the	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	 brid 	 e 	 	?
her	mother	,	that	's	right	.
her	mother	was	number	two	.
then	the	groom	's	father	,	then	the	groom	,	then	the	family	,	then	the	 friend 	 s 	 	--	 array 	 ed 	 	around	the	 brid 	 e 	 	like	 planet 	 s 	 	around	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
so	i	think	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	we	've	designed	 th 	 is 	 	ritual	to	connect	us	to	 th 	 is 	 	new	couple	,	connect	us	 emotion 	 ally 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	we	need	them	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	at	 re 	 producing 	 	to	 perpetu 	 ate 	 	the	species	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	my	trust	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	small	 amount 	 s 	 	of	money	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	capture	how	often	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	trust	our	 live 	 s 	 	to	 strange 	 rs 	 	.
so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	have	a	fear	of	 height 	 s 	 	,	i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 s 	 trapped 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	and	 steppe 	 d 	 	out	of	an	 air 	 plane 	 	at	12,000	ft	.
i	took	my	blood	before	and	after	,	and	i	had	a	huge	spike	of	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
and	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	ways	we	can	connect	to	people	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	through	social	media	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	are	 tweet 	 ing 	 	right	now	.
so	we	 investigate 	 d 	 	the	role	of	social	media	and	found	the	using	social	media	 produce 	 d 	 	a	solid	double	-	digit	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
so	i	ran	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	for	the	korean	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	system	.
and	they	had	the	 report 	 ers 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 produce 	 rs 	 	 particip 	 ate 	 	.
and	one	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	he	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	22	,	he	had	150	percent	spike	in	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
i	mean	,	 astound 	 ing 	 	;	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	he	was	using	social	media	in	private	.
when	i	wrote	my	report	to	the	koreans	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	i	do	n't	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	guy	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	``	but	my	guess	was	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	his	mother	or	his	girlfriend	.
they	 check 	 ed 	 	.
he	was	 interact 	 ing 	 	on	his	girlfriend	's	facebook	page	.
there	you	go	.	that	's	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
so	there	's	 ton 	 s 	 	of	ways	that	we	can	connect	to	other	people	,	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	universal	.
two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	just	got	back	from	papua	new	guinea	where	i	went	up	to	the	 high 	 land 	 s 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	 tribe 	 s 	 	of	 sub 	 s 	 ist 	 ence 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	living	 a 	 s 	 	they	have	lived	for	 mill 	 en 	 ia 	 	.
there	are	800	different	 language 	 s 	 	in	the	 high 	 land 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	most	primitive	people	in	the	world	.
and	they	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 lease 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
so	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	us	to	other	people	.
 oxy 	 tocin 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	feel	what	other	people	feel	.
and	it	's	so	easy	to	cause	people	's	 brain 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 lease 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
i	know	how	to	do	it	,	and	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	way	to	do	it	is	,	in	fact	,	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	.
let	me	show	it	to	you	.
come	here	.	give	me	a	hug	.
there	you	go	.
so	my	 p 	 enchant 	 	for	 hugg 	 ing 	 	other	people	 ha 	 s 	 	 earn 	 ed 	 	me	the	 nick 	 name 	 	dr.	love	.
i	'm	happy	to	share	a	little	more	love	in	the	world	,	it	's	great	,	but	here	's	your	prescription	from	dr.	love	:	eight	 hug 	 s 	 	a	day	.
we	have	found	that	people	who	 re 	 lease 	 	more	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	are	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	.
and	they	're	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	better	 relationship 	 s 	 	of	all	 type 	 s 	 	.
dr.	love	 say 	 s 	 	eight	 hug 	 s 	 	a	day	.
eight	 hug 	 s 	 	a	day	--	you	'll	be	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	and	the	world	will	be	a	better	place	.
of	course	,	if	you	do	n't	like	to	touch	people	,	i	can	 al 	 ways 	 	shove	 th 	 is 	 	up	your	nose	.
thank	you	.
