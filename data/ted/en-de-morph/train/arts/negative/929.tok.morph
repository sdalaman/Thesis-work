i	grew	up	on	a	small	farm	in	missouri	.
we	lived	on	less	than	a	dollar	a	day	for	about	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	got	a	 scholar 	 ship 	 	,	went	to	university	,	 stud 	 ied 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	 stud 	 ied 	 	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	,	and	 decide 	 d 	 	i	was	going	to	give	back	.
i	was	going	to	work	with	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
i	was	going	to	help	 allevi 	 ate 	 	poverty	.
i	was	going	to	work	on	 inter 	 national 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	and	then	i	took	a	turn	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	here	.
now	,	if	you	get	a	ph.d.	,	and	you	decide	not	to	teach	,	you	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	end	up	in	a	place	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	a	choice	.	you	might	end	up	 driv 	 ing 	 	a	 taxi 	 cab 	 	.
you	could	be	in	new	york	.
what	i	found	was	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 refuge 	 es 	 	and	famine	 victim 	 s 	 	--	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	all	,	or	 near 	 ly 	 	all	--	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 dis 	 possess 	 ed 	 	and	 dis 	 place 	 d 	 	.
now	,	what	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	trained	to	do	was	 method 	 o 	 logical 	 	research	on	 s 	 uch 	 	people	.
so	i	did	it	:	i	found	out	how	 man 	 y 	 	women	had	 be 	 en 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	en	route	to	these	 camp 	 s 	 	.
i	found	out	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	had	 be 	 en 	 	put	in	jail	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	family	 member 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
i	 assess 	 ed 	 	how	long	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	stay	and	how	much	it	would	take	to	feed	them	.
and	i	got	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	 predict 	 ing 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	body	 bag 	 s 	 	you	would	need	for	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	die	in	these	 camp 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	god	's	work	,	but	it	's	not	my	work	.
it	's	not	the	work	i	set	out	to	do	.
so	i	was	at	a	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	dead	benefit	concert	on	the	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	in	1988	.
i	met	a	guy	--	the	guy	on	the	left	.
his	name	was	ben	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	can	i	do	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	ben	,	what	do	you	do	?	``
``	i	make	ice	cream	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	've	got	to	make	a	 rain 	 forest 	 	ice	cream	.
and	you	've	got	to	use	nuts	from	the	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	to	show	that	 forest 	 s 	 	are	worth	more	 a 	 s 	 	 forest 	 s 	 	than	they	are	 a 	 s 	 	 past 	 ure 	 	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	``
 with 	 in 	 	a	year	,	 rain 	 forest 	 	crunch	was	on	the	 shelv 	 es 	 	.
it	was	a	great	success	.
we	did	our	first	million	-	 dollar 	 s 	 	-	worth	of	trade	by	 buy 	 ing 	 	on	30	 day 	 s 	 	and	selling	on	21	.
that	 get 	 s 	 	your	 adrenalin 	 e 	 	going	.
then	we	had	a	four	and	a	half	million	-	dollar	line	of	credit	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	credit	-	worthy	at	that	point	.
we	had	15	to	20	,	 may 	 be 	 	22	percent	of	the	global	brazil	-	nut	market	.
we	paid	two	to	three	 time 	 s 	 	more	than	 any 	 body 	 	else	.
 every 	 body 	 	else	raised	 the 	 ir 	 	 price 	 s 	 	to	the	 gatherer 	 s 	 	of	brazil	nuts	 be 	 cause 	 	we	would	buy	it	 other 	 wise 	 	.
a	great	success	.
50	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	,	200	 product 	 s 	 	came	out	,	generated	100	million	in	 sale 	 s 	 	.
it	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
why	did	it	fail	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 gather 	 ing 	 	brazil	nuts	 we 	 re 	 	n't	the	same	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	cutting	the	 forest 	 s 	 	.
and	the	people	who	made	money	from	brazil	nuts	 we 	 re 	 	not	the	people	who	made	money	from	cutting	the	 forest 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	wrong	driver	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	on	beef	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	on	lumber	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 so 	 y 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	not	focused	on	.
so	let	's	go	back	to	sudan	.
i	often	talk	to	 refuge 	 es 	 	:	``	why	was	it	that	the	west	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 famine 	 s 	 	are	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 poli 	 cies 	 	and	 politic 	 s 	 	,	not	by	weather	?	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	 farm 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	one	day	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	ca	n't	wake	a	person	who	's	 pretend 	 ing 	 	to	sleep	.	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	fast	forward	.
we	live	on	a	planet	.
there	's	just	one	of	them	.
we	've	got	to	wake	up	to	the	fact	that	we	do	n't	have	any	more	and	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	planet	.
we	know	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	the	 resource 	 s 	 	we	have	.
we	may	be	able	to	use	them	 different 	 ly 	 	.
we	may	have	some	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
but	in	general	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	've	got	.
there	's	no	more	of	it	.
there	's	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	that	we	ca	n't	get	away	from	.
population	 time 	 s 	 	consumption	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	have	some	kind	of	relationship	to	the	planet	,	and	right	now	,	it	's	a	simple	``	not	equal	.	``
our	work	 show 	 s 	 	that	we	're	living	at	about	1.3	 planet 	 s 	 	.
since	1990	,	we	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	line	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	relationship	to	the	planet	.
now	we	're	at	1.3	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	we	'd	be	eating	our	seed	.
for	 bank 	 ers 	 	,	we	'd	be	living	off	the	principal	,	not	the	interest	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	stand	 to 	 day 	 	.
a	lot	of	people	like	to	point	to	some	place	else	 a 	 s 	 	the	cause	of	the	problem	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	population	growth	.
population	growth	's	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	about	how	much	each	person	 consum 	 es 	 	.
so	when	the	average	american	 consum 	 es 	 	43	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	average	african	,	we	've	got	to	think	that	consumption	is	an	issue	.
it	's	not	just	about	population	,	and	it	's	not	just	about	them	;	it	's	about	us	.
but	it	's	not	just	about	people	;	it	's	about	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	evidence	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	have	a	peer	-	 review 	 ed 	 	 method 	 ology 	 	that	's	 bullet 	 proof 	 	yet	--	but	there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	evidence	that	the	average	cat	in	europe	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 large 	 r 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 foot 	 print 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 life 	 time 	 	than	the	average	african	.
you	think	that	's	not	an	issue	going	forward	?
you	think	that	's	not	a	question	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	we	should	be	using	the	earth	's	 resource 	 s 	 	?
let	's	go	back	and	visit	our	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
in	2000	,	we	had	six	billion	people	on	the	planet	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 consum 	 ing 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 consum 	 ing 	 	--	let	's	say	one	unit	of	consumption	each	.
we	have	six	billion	 unit 	 s 	 	of	consumption	.
by	2050	,	we	're	going	to	have	nine	billion	people	--	all	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	agree	.
they	're	all	going	to	 consum 	 e 	 	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	they	 current 	 ly 	 	do	--	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	agree	--	 be 	 cause 	 	income	is	going	to	grow	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	five	 time 	 s 	 	what	it	is	 to 	 day 	 	--	on	global	average	,	about	[	2.9	]	.
so	we	're	going	to	have	18	billion	 unit 	 s 	 	of	consumption	.
who	have	you	heard	 talk 	 ing 	 	 late 	 ly 	 	that	's	 s 	 aid 	 	we	have	to	triple	production	of	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	?
but	that	's	what	the	math	 say 	 s 	 	.
we	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	do	that	.
we	can	get	 product 	 ivity 	 	up	.
we	can	get	efficiency	up	.
but	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	got	to	get	consumption	down	.
we	need	to	use	less	to	make	more	.
and	then	we	need	to	use	less	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	then	we	need	to	 consum 	 e 	 	less	.
all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	part	of	that	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
but	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 raise 	 s 	 	a	fundamental	question	:	should	 consumer 	 s 	 	have	a	choice	about	 sustain 	 ability 	 	,	about	 sustain 	 able 	 	 product 	 s 	 	?
should	you	be	able	to	buy	a	product	that	's	 sustain 	 able 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	one	that	is	n't	,	or	should	all	the	 product 	 s 	 	on	the	shelf	be	 sustain 	 able 	 	?
if	they	should	all	be	 sustain 	 able 	 	on	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	planet	,	how	do	you	make	that	happen	?
the	average	consumer	 take 	 s 	 	1.8	 second 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	let	's	be	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	.
let	's	say	it	's	3.5	 second 	 s 	 	in	europe	.
how	do	you	evaluate	all	the	scientific	data	around	a	product	,	the	data	that	's	changing	on	a	 week 	 ly 	 	,	if	not	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	,	 bas 	 is 	 	?
how	do	you	get	 inform 	 ed 	 	?
you	do	n't	.
here	's	a	little	question	.
from	a	 green 	 house 	 	gas	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	is	lamb	 produce 	 d 	 	in	the	u.k	.
better	than	lamb	 produce 	 d 	 	in	new	zealand	,	 froze 	 n 	 	and	 ship 	 ped 	 	to	the	u.k.	?
is	a	bad	 feed 	 er 	 	lot	operation	for	beef	better	or	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	a	bad	grazing	operation	for	beef	?
do	 organ 	 ic 	 	 potato 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 few 	 er 	 	toxic	 chemical 	 s 	 	used	to	produce	them	than	 convention 	 al 	 	 potato 	 es 	 	?
in	every	single	case	,	the	answer	is	``	it	 depend 	 s 	 	.	``
it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	who	 produce 	 d 	 	it	and	how	,	in	every	single	 in 	 stance 	 	.
and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	.
how	is	a	consumer	going	to	walk	through	 th 	 is 	 	 mine 	 field 	 	?
they	're	not	.
they	may	have	a	lot	of	 opinion 	 s 	 	about	it	,	but	they	're	not	going	to	be	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 inform 	 ed 	 	.
 sustain 	 ability 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	a	pre	-	competitive	issue	.
it	's	got	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	we	all	care	about	.
and	we	need	 coll 	 usion 	 	.
we	need	 group 	 s 	 	to	work	together	that	never	have	.
we	need	cargill	to	work	with	bunge	.
we	need	 co 	 ke 	 	to	work	with	pepsi	.
we	need	oxford	to	work	with	cambridge	.
we	need	greenpeace	to	work	with	wwf	.
 every 	 body 	 	's	got	to	work	together	--	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	u.s	.
we	need	to	begin	to	manage	 th 	 is 	 	planet	 a 	 s 	 	if	our	life	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	it	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
but	we	ca	n't	do	 every 	 thing 	 	.
even	if	we	get	 every 	 body 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	,	we	've	got	to	be	 strat 	 egic 	 	.
we	need	to	focus	on	the	where	,	the	what	and	the	who	.
so	,	the	where	:	we	've	identified	35	 place 	 s 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	that	we	need	to	work	.
these	are	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	the	 rich 	 est 	 	in	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	from	an	 eco 	 system 	 	function	point	-	of	-	view	.
we	have	to	work	in	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	 s 	 ave 	 	these	 place 	 s 	 	if	we	want	a	chance	in	hell	of	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 threat 	 s 	 	to	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	15	 commodit 	 ies 	 	that	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	pose	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 threat 	 s 	 	to	these	 place 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	,	 s 	 oil 	 	loss	,	water	use	,	 pest 	 icide 	 	use	,	over	-	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	etc	.
so	we	've	got	35	 place 	 s 	 	,	we	've	got	15	 prior 	 ity 	 	 commodit 	 ies 	 	,	who	do	we	work	with	to	change	the	way	 t 	 hose 	 	 commodit 	 ies 	 	are	 produce 	 d 	 	?
are	we	going	to	work	with	6.9	billion	 consumer 	 s 	 	?
let	's	see	,	that	's	about	7,000	 language 	 s 	 	,	350	major	 language 	 s 	 	--	a	lot	of	work	there	.
i	do	n't	see	 any 	 body 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	do	that	 ver 	 y 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	.
are	we	going	to	work	with	1.5	billion	 produce 	 rs 	 	?
 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	 daunt 	 ing 	 	task	.
there	must	be	a	better	way	.
300	to	500	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	control	70	percent	or	more	of	the	trade	of	each	of	the	15	 commodit 	 ies 	 	that	we	've	identified	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	significant	.
if	we	work	with	 t 	 hose 	 	,	if	we	change	 t 	 hose 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	the	way	they	do	business	,	then	the	rest	will	happen	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
so	,	we	went	through	our	15	 commodit 	 ies 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	nine	of	them	.
we	lined	them	up	side	-	by	-	side	,	and	we	put	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	work	on	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
and	if	you	go	through	the	first	25	or	30	 name 	 s 	 	of	each	of	the	 commodit 	 ies 	 	,	what	you	begin	to	see	is	,	 go 	 sh 	 	,	there	's	cargill	here	,	there	's	cargill	there	,	there	's	cargill	 every 	 where 	 	.
in	fact	,	these	 name 	 s 	 	start	coming	up	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	we	did	the	analysis	 aga 	 in 	 	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	way	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	:	if	we	take	the	top	hundred	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	all	15	 commodit 	 ies 	 	do	they	touch	,	buy	or	sell	?
and	what	we	found	is	it	's	25	percent	.
so	100	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	control	25	percent	of	the	trade	of	all	15	of	the	most	significant	 commodit 	 ies 	 	on	the	planet	.
we	can	get	our	 arm 	 s 	 	around	a	hundred	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
a	hundred	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	we	can	work	with	.
why	is	25	percent	 import 	 ant 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	if	these	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	demand	 sustain 	 able 	 	 product 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	pull	40	to	50	percent	of	production	.
 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	can	push	 produce 	 rs 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	 consumer 	 s 	 	can	.
by	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	can	leverage	production	so	much	 fast 	 er 	 	than	by	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	 consumer 	 s 	 	to	do	it	.
after	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	global	 organ 	 ic 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	0.7	of	one	percent	of	global	food	.
we	ca	n't	wait	that	long	.
we	do	n't	have	that	kind	of	time	.
we	need	change	that	's	going	to	 accele 	 rate 	 	.
even	 work 	 ing 	 	with	individual	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	is	not	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	get	us	there	.
we	need	to	begin	to	work	with	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
so	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	 round 	 table 	 s 	 	where	we	 br 	 ing 	 	together	the	entire	value	chain	,	from	 produce 	 rs 	 	all	the	way	to	the	 re 	 tail 	 ers 	 	and	 brand 	 s 	 	.
we	 br 	 ing 	 	in	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	we	 br 	 ing 	 	in	ngos	,	we	 br 	 ing 	 	in	 research 	 ers 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	to	have	an	 inform 	 ed 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	battle	 royal 	 e 	 	--	to	figure	out	what	are	the	key	 impact 	 s 	 	of	these	 product 	 s 	 	,	what	is	a	global	 bench 	 mark 	 	,	what	's	an	 accept 	 able 	 	impact	,	and	design	 standard 	 s 	 	around	that	.
it	's	not	all	 f 	 un 	 	and	 game 	 s 	 	.
in	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	 aqua 	 culture 	 	,	we	 kick 	 ed 	 	off	a	 round 	 table 	 	 al 	 most 	 	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
eight	 ent 	 ities 	 	came	to	the	table	.
we	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	got	,	i	think	,	60	percent	of	global	production	at	the	table	and	25	percent	of	demand	at	the	table	.
three	of	the	original	eight	 ent 	 ities 	 	 we 	 re 	 	suing	each	other	.
and	yet	,	next	week	,	we	launch	 global 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 ified 	 	,	 vet 	 ted 	 	and	 cert 	 ified 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	for	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	 aqua 	 culture 	 	.
it	can	happen	.
so	what	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	different	 ent 	 ities 	 	to	the	table	?
it	's	risk	and	demand	.
for	the	big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	it	's	 reputation 	 al 	 	risk	,	but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	they	do	n't	care	what	the	price	of	 commodit 	 ies 	 	is	.
if	they	do	n't	have	 commodit 	 ies 	 	,	they	do	n't	have	a	business	.
they	care	about	 avail 	 ability 	 	,	so	the	big	risk	for	them	is	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	product	at	all	.
for	the	 produce 	 rs 	 	,	if	a	 buy 	 er 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	buy	 some 	 thing 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	a	certain	way	,	that	's	what	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	them	to	the	table	.
so	it	's	the	demand	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	them	to	the	table	.
the	good	news	is	we	identified	a	hundred	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
in	the	last	18	 month 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 sign 	 ed 	 	 agree 	 ments 	 	with	40	of	 t 	 hose 	 	hundred	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	begin	to	work	with	them	on	 the 	 ir 	 	supply	chain	.
and	in	the	next	18	 month 	 s 	 	,	we	will	have	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	to	work	with	 an 	 other 	 	40	,	and	we	think	we	'll	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 sign 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
now	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	ceos	of	these	80	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	together	to	help	twist	the	 arm 	 s 	 	of	the	final	20	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	them	to	the	table	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	like	ngos	,	they	've	never	 work 	 ed 	 	with	ngos	,	they	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	that	,	but	we	all	need	to	be	in	 th 	 is 	 	together	.
so	we	're	 pull 	 ing 	 	out	all	the	 stop 	 s 	 	.
we	're	using	 what 	 ever 	 	leverage	we	have	to	 br 	 ing 	 	them	to	the	table	.
one	company	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	that	's	 beg 	 un 	 	--	in	baby	 step 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	--	but	 ha 	 s 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	 th 	 is 	 	journey	on	 sustain 	 ability 	 	is	cargill	.
they	've	funded	research	that	 show 	 s 	 	that	we	can	double	global	palm	oil	production	 with 	 out 	 	cutting	a	single	tree	in	the	next	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	do	it	all	in	borneo	 al 	 one 	 	by	 plant 	 ing 	 	on	land	that	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	.
the	 stud 	 y 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	the	highest	net	present	value	for	palm	oil	is	on	land	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	.
they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 under 	 taking 	 	a	 stud 	 y 	 	to	look	at	all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 suppli 	 es 	 	of	palm	oil	to	see	if	they	could	be	 cert 	 ified 	 	and	what	they	would	need	to	change	in	order	to	 be 	 come 	 	third	-	party	 cert 	 ified 	 	under	a	credible	 cert 	 ification 	 	program	.
why	is	cargill	 import 	 ant 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	cargill	 ha 	 s 	 	20	to	25	percent	of	global	palm	oil	.
if	cargill	 make 	 s 	 	a	decision	,	the	entire	palm	oil	industry	 move 	 s 	 	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	40	or	50	percent	of	it	.
that	's	not	 in 	 significant 	 	.
more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	cargill	and	one	other	company	ship	50	percent	of	the	palm	oil	that	 go 	 es 	 	to	 chin 	 a 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	to	change	the	way	a	single	chinese	company	 work 	 s 	 	if	we	get	cargill	to	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 end 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	palm	oil	to	 chin 	 a 	 	.
it	's	a	pre	-	competitive	issue	.
all	the	palm	oil	going	there	is	good	.
buy	it	.
mars	is	 al 	 so 	 	on	a	similar	journey	.
now	most	people	understand	that	mars	is	a	chocolate	company	,	but	mars	 ha 	 s 	 	made	 sustain 	 ability 	 	 pledg 	 es 	 	to	buy	 on 	 ly 	 	 cert 	 ified 	 	product	for	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	 sea 	 food 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	mars	 buy 	 s 	 	more	 sea 	 food 	 	than	walmart	 be 	 cause 	 	of	pet	food	.
but	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	around	chocolate	,	and	it	all	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	fact	that	mars	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	in	business	in	the	future	.
and	what	they	see	is	that	they	need	to	improve	chocolate	production	.
on	any	 give 	 n 	 	 plant 	 ation 	 	,	20	percent	of	the	 tree 	 s 	 	produce	80	percent	of	the	crop	,	so	mars	is	looking	at	the	genome	,	they	're	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	the	genome	of	the	cocoa	plant	.
they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	with	ibm	and	the	usda	,	and	they	're	 put 	 ting 	 	it	in	the	public	domain	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	 every 	 body 	 	to	have	access	to	 th 	 is 	 	data	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	 every 	 body 	 	to	help	them	make	cocoa	more	productive	and	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
what	they	've	 real 	 ized 	 	is	that	if	they	can	identify	the	 trait 	 s 	 	on	 product 	 ivity 	 	and	drought	 toler 	 ance 	 	,	they	can	produce	320	percent	 a 	 s 	 	much	cocoa	on	40	percent	of	the	land	.
the	rest	of	the	land	can	be	used	for	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
it	's	more	with	less	and	less	 aga 	 in 	 	.
that	's	what	the	future	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	,	and	 put 	 ting 	 	it	in	the	public	domain	is	smart	.
they	do	n't	want	to	be	an	i.p	.	company	;	they	want	to	be	a	chocolate	company	,	but	they	want	to	be	a	chocolate	company	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
now	,	the	price	of	food	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	complain	about	,	but	in	fact	,	the	price	of	food	is	going	down	,	and	that	's	odd	 be 	 cause 	 	in	fact	,	 consumer 	 s 	 	are	not	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	the	true	cost	of	food	.
if	you	take	a	look	just	at	water	,	what	we	see	is	that	,	with	four	 ver 	 y 	 	common	 product 	 s 	 	,	you	look	at	how	much	a	 farm 	 er 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	to	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 product 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	look	at	how	much	water	 in 	 put 	 	was	put	 in 	 to 	 	them	,	and	then	you	look	at	what	the	 farm 	 er 	 	was	paid	.
if	you	divide	the	amount	of	water	 in 	 to 	 	what	the	 farm 	 er 	 	was	paid	,	the	 farm 	 er 	 	did	n't	 receiv 	 e 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	pay	a	 de 	 cent 	 	price	for	water	in	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 commodit 	 ies 	 	.
that	is	an	 external 	 ity 	 	by	definition	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 sub 	 s 	 idy 	 	from	nature	.
coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	,	they	've	 work 	 ed 	 	a	lot	on	water	,	but	right	now	,	they	're	 enter 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	17	-	year	 contract 	 s 	 	with	 grow 	 ers 	 	in	 tur 	 key 	 	to	sell	juice	 in 	 to 	 	europe	,	and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	to	have	a	product	that	's	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	european	market	.
but	they	're	not	just	 buy 	 ing 	 	the	juice	;	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	the	carbon	in	the	 tree 	 s 	 	to	 off 	 set 	 	the	 ship 	 ment 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	carbon	to	get	the	product	 in 	 to 	 	europe	.
there	's	carbon	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	with	sugar	,	with	coffee	,	with	beef	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 bundl 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 external 	 ities 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	price	of	the	 commodit 	 y 	 	.
we	need	to	take	what	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	private	,	voluntary	 standard 	 s 	 	of	what	the	best	 produce 	 rs 	 	in	the	world	are	 do 	 ing 	 	and	use	that	to	inform	government	 regulat 	 ion 	 	,	so	we	can	shift	the	entire	performance	 curv 	 e 	 	.
we	ca	n't	just	focus	on	 identify 	 ing 	 	the	best	;	we	've	got	to	move	the	rest	.
the	issue	is	n't	what	to	think	,	it	's	how	to	think	.
these	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	have	 beg 	 un 	 	to	think	 different 	 ly 	 	.
they	're	on	a	journey	;	there	's	no	 turn 	 ing 	 	back	.
we	're	all	on	that	same	journey	with	them	.
we	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	begin	to	change	the	way	we	think	about	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 what 	 ever 	 	was	 sustain 	 able 	 	on	a	planet	of	six	billion	is	not	going	to	be	 sustain 	 able 	 	on	a	planet	with	nine	.
thank	you	.
