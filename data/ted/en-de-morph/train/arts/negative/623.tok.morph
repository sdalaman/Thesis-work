i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	one	of	the	world	's	largest	 problem 	 s 	 	and	how	it	can	be	 solve 	 d 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	start	with	a	little	experiment	.
could	you	put	your	hand	up	if	you	wear	 glass 	 es 	 	or	contact	 lens 	 es 	 	,	or	you	've	had	laser	 refr 	 active 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	?
now	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	there	are	too	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	for	me	to	do	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
but	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	--	i	'm	 guess 	 ing 	 	--	that	it	'll	be	about	60	percent	of	the	room	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	fraction	of	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	population	that	have	some	sort	of	vision	 correct 	 ion 	 	.
the	world	health	 organ 	 ization 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	--	well	,	they	make	 vari 	 ous 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	of	the	number	of	people	who	need	 glass 	 es 	 	--	the	 low 	 est 	 	estimate	is	150	million	people	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	have	an	estimate	of	around	a	billion	.
but	in	fact	,	i	would	 argu 	 e 	 	that	we	've	just	 d 	 one 	 	an	experiment	here	and	now	,	which	 show 	 s 	 	us	that	the	global	need	for	 correct 	 ive 	 	 eye 	 wear 	 	is	around	half	of	any	population	.
and	the	problem	of	poor	vision	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	just	a	health	problem	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	 education 	 al 	 	problem	,	and	it	's	an	economic	problem	,	and	it	's	a	quality	of	life	problem	.
 glass 	 es 	 	are	not	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	.	they	're	 quit 	 e 	 	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	.
the	problem	is	,	there	are	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	eye	care	 professional 	 s 	 	in	the	world	to	use	the	model	of	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	 correct 	 ive 	 	 eye 	 wear 	 	that	we	have	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	.
there	are	just	way	too	few	eye	care	 professional 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	little	slide	here	 show 	 s 	 	you	an	optometrist	and	the	little	blue	person	 represent 	 s 	 	about	10,000	people	and	that	's	the	ratio	in	the	u.k	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	ratio	of	 optometrist 	 s 	 	to	people	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
in	fact	,	there	are	some	 count 	 ries 	 	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	where	there	's	one	optometrist	for	eight	million	of	the	population	.
how	do	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	how	do	you	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	?
i	came	up	with	a	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	and	i	came	up	with	a	solution	based	on	 adapt 	 ive 	 	 optic 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	idea	is	you	make	eye	 glass 	 es 	 	,	and	you	adjust	them	 your 	 self 	 	and	that	 solve 	 s 	 	the	problem	.
what	i	want	to	do	is	to	show	you	that	one	can	make	a	pair	of	 glass 	 es 	 	.
i	 s 	 hall 	 	just	show	you	how	you	make	a	pair	of	 glass 	 es 	 	.	i	 s 	 hall 	 	pop	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	pocket	.
i	'm	short	 sight 	 ed 	 	.	i	look	at	the	 sign 	 s 	 	at	the	end	,	i	can	 hard 	 ly 	 	see	them	.
so	--	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	can	now	see	that	man	running	out	there	,	and	i	can	see	that	guy	running	out	there	.
i	've	now	made	prescription	 eye 	 wear 	 	to	my	prescription	.
next	step	in	my	process	.
so	,	i	've	now	made	eye	 glass 	 es 	 	to	my	prescription	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	i	've	made	these	 glass 	 es 	 	and	...
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	've	made	the	 glass 	 es 	 	to	my	prescription	and	...
...	i	've	just	...
and	i	've	now	made	some	 glass 	 es 	 	.	that	's	it	.
now	,	these	are	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	pair	in	the	world	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	technology	's	 be 	 en 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	in	1985	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
there	are	about	30,000	in	use	now	.
and	they	're	in	fifteen	 count 	 ries 	 	.	they	're	spread	around	the	world	.
and	i	have	a	vision	,	which	i	'll	share	with	you	.
i	have	a	global	vision	for	vision	.
and	that	vision	is	to	try	to	get	a	billion	people	 wear 	 ing 	 	the	 glass 	 es 	 	they	need	by	the	year	2020	.
to	do	that	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	early	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	technology	.
the	technology	is	 be 	 ing 	 	further	 develop 	 ed 	 	--	the	cost	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	down	.
 th 	 is 	 	pair	,	in	fact	,	these	 current 	 ly 	 	cost	about	19	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
but	the	cost	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	right	down	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	down	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	serve	 population 	 s 	 	who	live	on	a	dollar	a	day	.
how	do	you	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	?
you	start	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	detail	.
and	on	 th 	 is 	 	slide	,	i	'm	 bas 	 ically 	 	 explain 	 ing 	 	all	the	 problem 	 s 	 	you	have	.
how	do	you	 distribut 	 e 	 	?	how	do	you	work	out	how	to	fit	the	thing	?
how	do	you	have	people	 real 	 izing 	 	that	they	have	a	vision	problem	?
how	do	you	deal	with	the	industry	?
and	the	answer	to	that	is	research	.
what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	to	set	up	the	center	for	vision	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	here	in	the	university	.
if	you	want	to	know	more	,	just	come	have	a	look	at	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.	thank	you	.
