do	you	ever	feel	 complete 	 ly 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	when	you	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	a	complex	problem	?
well	,	i	hope	to	change	that	in	less	than	three	 minute 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	hope	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	complex	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	equal	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
so	for	me	,	a	well	-	 craft 	 ed 	 	 bag 	 u 	 ette 	 	,	fresh	out	of	the	oven	,	is	complex	,	but	a	 curr 	 y 	 	 on 	 ion 	 	green	 o 	 live 	 	 pop 	 py 	 	cheese	bread	is	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
i	'm	an	ecologist	,	and	i	 stud 	 y 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	.	i	love	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	 stud 	 y 	 	that	in	the	natural	world	,	the	 interconnect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	of	species	.
so	here	's	a	food	web	,	or	a	map	of	 feed 	 ing 	 	 link 	 s 	 	between	species	that	live	in	 al 	 pine 	 	 lake 	 s 	 	in	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	of	california	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	that	food	web	when	it	's	 stock 	 ed 	 	with	non	-	native	fish	that	never	lived	there	before	.
all	the	grayed	-	out	species	disappear	.
some	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	on	the	 br 	 ink 	 	of	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.
and	 lake 	 s 	 	with	fish	have	more	 mosquito 	 es 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	eat	them	.
these	 effect 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	 un 	 anticip 	 ated 	 	,	and	yet	we	're	 discover 	 ing 	 	they	're	 predict 	 able 	 	.
so	i	want	to	share	with	you	a	couple	key	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	about	 complex 	 ity 	 	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	nature	that	 may 	 be 	 	are	 appli 	 cable 	 	to	other	 problem 	 s 	 	.
first	is	the	simple	power	of	good	 visual 	 ization 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	to	help	 un 	 tangle 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	just	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	ask	 question 	 s 	 	you	did	n't	think	of	before	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	could	plot	the	flow	of	carbon	through	corporate	supply	 chain 	 s 	 	in	a	corporate	 eco 	 system 	 	,	or	the	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	of	 habit 	 at 	 	 patch 	 es 	 	for	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	in	yosemite	national	park	.
the	next	thing	is	that	if	you	want	to	predict	the	effect	of	one	species	on	 an 	 other 	 	,	if	you	focus	 on 	 ly 	 	on	that	link	,	and	then	you	black	box	the	rest	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	less	 predict 	 able 	 	than	if	you	step	back	,	consider	the	entire	system	--	all	the	species	,	all	the	 link 	 s 	 	--	and	from	that	place	,	hone	in	on	the	sphere	of	influence	that	 matter 	 s 	 	most	.
and	we	're	 discover 	 ing 	 	,	with	our	research	,	that	's	often	 ver 	 y 	 	local	to	the	 no 	 de 	 	you	care	about	 with 	 in 	 	one	or	two	 degree 	 s 	 	.
so	the	more	you	step	back	,	embrace	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	the	better	chance	you	have	of	 find 	 ing 	 	simple	 answer 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	often	different	than	the	simple	answer	that	you	 start 	 ed 	 	with	.
so	let	's	 s 	 witch 	 	 gear 	 s 	 	and	look	at	a	 re 	 ally 	 	complex	problem	 court 	 es 	 y 	 	of	the	u.s.	government	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	the	u.s.	 counter 	 insurgency 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	in	afghanistan	.
it	was	front	page	of	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	a	couple	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
 instant 	 ly 	 	 ridicul 	 ed 	 	by	the	media	for	 be 	 ing 	 	so	crazy	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
and	the	 state 	 d 	 	goal	was	to	 in 	 crease 	 	popular	support	for	the	afghan	government	.
 clear 	 ly 	 	a	complex	problem	,	but	is	it	 complic 	 ated 	 	?
well	,	when	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	front	page	of	the	 time 	 s 	 	,	i	thought	,	``	great	.	 final 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	i	can	 re 	 late 	 	to	.
i	can	sink	my	 tee 	 th 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
so	let	's	do	it	.	so	here	we	go	for	the	first	time	ever	,	a	world	premiere	view	of	 th 	 is 	 	spaghetti	 dia 	 gram 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 order 	 ed 	 	network	.
the	 circle 	 d 	 	 no 	 de 	 	is	the	one	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	influence	--	popular	support	for	the	government	.
and	so	now	we	can	look	one	 degree 	 s 	 	,	two	 degree 	 s 	 	,	three	 degree 	 s 	 	away	from	that	 no 	 de 	 	and	eliminate	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	 out 	 side 	 	that	sphere	of	influence	.
 with 	 in 	 	that	sphere	,	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 nod 	 es 	 	are	not	 action 	 able 	 	,	like	the	 harsh 	 ness 	 	of	the	 terra 	 in 	 	,	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 minor 	 ity 	 	are	actual	 militar 	 y 	 	 action 	 s 	 	.
most	are	non	-	violent	and	they	fall	 in 	 to 	 	two	broad	 categor 	 ies 	 	:	active	 engage 	 ment 	 	with	ethnic	 rival 	 ries 	 	and	religious	 belief 	 s 	 	and	fair	,	 trans 	 parent 	 	economic	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	 pro 	 vision 	 ing 	 	of	 service 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	can	decipher	from	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	in	24	 second 	 s 	 	.
when	you	see	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	do	n't	want	you	to	be	 af 	 raid 	 	.
i	want	you	to	be	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	i	want	you	to	be	 reliev 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	simple	 answer 	 s 	 	may	emerge	.
we	're	 discover 	 ing 	 	in	nature	that	 simpl 	 icity 	 	often	lies	on	the	other	side	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
so	for	any	problem	,	the	more	you	can	zoom	out	and	embrace	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	the	better	chance	you	have	of	 zoom 	 ing 	 	in	on	the	simple	 detail 	 s 	 	that	matter	most	.
thank	you	.
