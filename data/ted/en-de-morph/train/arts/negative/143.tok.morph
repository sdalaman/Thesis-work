so	i	want	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	 aid 	 s 	 	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	-	educated	audience	,	so	i	imagine	you	all	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 aid 	 s 	 	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	that	 rough 	 ly 	 	25	million	people	in	africa	are	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	the	virus	,	that	 aid 	 s 	 	is	a	disease	of	poverty	,	and	that	if	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	africa	out	of	poverty	,	we	would	 de 	 crease 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
if	you	know	 some 	 thing 	 	more	,	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	that	uganda	,	to	date	,	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	country	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	that	 ha 	 s 	 	had	success	in	 combat 	 ing 	 	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
using	a	campaign	that	 encourag 	 ed 	 	people	to	 ab 	 stain 	 	,	be	 faith 	 ful 	 	,	and	use	 condom 	 s 	 	--	the	abc	campaign	--	they	 de 	 crease 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 pre 	 valence 	 	in	the	1990s	from	about	15	percent	to	6	percent	over	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	you	follow	policy	,	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	that	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	the	 p 	 resident 	 	 pledg 	 ed 	 	15	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	fight	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	over	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	a	lot	of	that	money	is	going	to	go	to	 program 	 s 	 	that	try	to	replicate	uganda	and	use	behavior	change	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	people	and	 de 	 crease 	 	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	might	not	know	about	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	,	and	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	some	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	think	that	you	do	know	.
to	do	that	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	my	research	 a 	 s 	 	an	economist	on	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	talk	much	about	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
i	'm	not	going	to	tell	you	about	 export 	 s 	 	and	 price 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	going	to	use	 tool 	 s 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	familiar	to	 economist 	 s 	 	to	think	about	a	problem	that	's	more	 tradition 	 ally 	 	part	of	public	health	and	 epidemio 	 logy 	 	.
and	i	think	in	that	sense	,	 th 	 is 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	lateral	 think 	 ing 	 	idea	.
here	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	using	the	 tool 	 s 	 	of	one	academic	discipline	to	think	about	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	we	think	,	first	and	 fore 	 most 	 	,	 aid 	 s 	 	is	a	policy	issue	.
and	 prob 	 ably 	 	for	most	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	that	's	how	you	think	about	it	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	talk	is	going	to	be	about	 understand 	 ing 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	about	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
it	's	going	to	be	about	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	it	 evolve 	 s 	 	,	and	how	people	respond	to	it	.
i	think	it	may	seem	like	i	'm	 ignor 	 ing 	 	the	policy	stuff	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	you	will	conclude	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	not	develop	effective	policy	 un 	 less 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	how	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	the	first	thing	that	i	want	to	talk	about	,	the	first	thing	i	think	we	need	to	understand	is	:	how	do	people	respond	to	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	?
so	 aid 	 s 	 	is	a	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	 infect 	 ion 	 	,	and	it	 kill 	 s 	 	you	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	in	a	place	with	a	lot	of	 aid 	 s 	 	,	there	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	significant	cost	of	 s 	 ex 	 	.
if	you	're	an	 un 	 infect 	 ed 	 	man	living	in	botswana	,	where	the	hiv	rate	is	30	percent	,	if	you	have	one	more	partner	 th 	 is 	 	year	--	a	long	-	term	partner	,	girlfriend	,	 mi 	 stress 	 	--	your	chance	of	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	10	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	by	three	 percent 	 age 	 	 point 	 s 	 	.
that	is	a	huge	effect	.
and	so	i	think	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	like	then	people	should	have	less	 s 	 ex 	 	.
and	in	fact	among	 ga 	 y 	 	men	in	the	us	we	did	see	that	kind	of	change	in	the	1980s	.
so	if	we	look	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	high	-	risk	 s 	 ample 	 	,	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	did	you	have	more	than	one	 un 	 protect 	 ed 	 	sexual	partner	in	the	last	two	 month 	 s 	 	?	``
over	a	period	from	'84	to	'88	,	that	share	 drop 	 s 	 	from	about	85	percent	to	55	percent	.
it	's	a	huge	change	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	period	of	time	.
we	did	n't	see	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	in	africa	.
so	we	do	n't	have	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	data	,	but	you	can	see	here	the	share	of	single	men	 hav 	 ing 	 	pre	-	marital	 s 	 ex 	 	,	or	married	men	 hav 	 ing 	 	extra	-	marital	 s 	 ex 	 	,	and	how	that	 change 	 s 	 	from	the	early	'90s	to	late	'90s	,	and	late	'90s	to	early	2000s	.	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
people	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	more	 thing 	 s 	 	about	it	.
we	see	 al 	 most 	 	no	change	in	sexual	behavior	.
these	are	just	 tin 	 y 	 	 de 	 crease 	 s 	 	--	two	 percent 	 age 	 	 point 	 s 	 	--	not	significant	.
 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	 puzzl 	 ing 	 	.	but	i	'm	going	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	you	should	n't	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	that	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	you	need	to	think	about	health	the	way	than	an	economist	 do 	 es 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	an	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
so	if	you	're	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	engineer	and	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	think	about	 whet 	 her 	 	to	add	some	new	 functional 	 ity 	 	to	your	program	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	think	about	how	much	it	 cost 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	think	about	what	the	benefit	is	.
and	one	part	of	that	benefit	is	how	much	 long 	 er 	 	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	program	is	going	to	be	active	.
if	version	10	is	coming	out	next	week	,	there	's	no	point	in	 add 	 ing 	 	more	 functional 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	version	nine	.
but	your	health	 decision 	 s 	 	are	the	same	.
every	time	you	have	a	carrot	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	cookie	,	every	time	you	go	to	the	gym	 in 	 stead 	 	of	going	to	the	 movie 	 s 	 	,	that	's	a	 cost 	 ly 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	your	health	.
but	how	much	you	want	to	invest	is	going	to	depend	on	how	much	 long 	 er 	 	you	expect	to	live	in	the	future	,	even	if	you	do	n't	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 invest 	 ments 	 	.
 aid 	 s 	 	is	the	same	kind	of	thing	.	it	's	 cost 	 ly 	 	to	avoid	 aid 	 s 	 	.
people	 re 	 ally 	 	like	to	have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
but	,	you	know	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	benefit	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	future	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	.
but	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	in	africa	,	even	 with 	 out 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	low	:	40	or	50	 year 	 s 	 	in	a	lot	of	 place 	 s 	 	.
i	think	it	's	possible	,	if	we	think	about	that	 intuit 	 ion 	 	,	and	think	about	that	fact	,	that	 may 	 be 	 	that	 explain 	 s 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	low	behavior	change	.
but	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	test	that	.
and	a	great	way	to	test	that	is	to	look	 a 	 cross 	 	 area 	 s 	 	in	africa	and	see	:	do	people	with	more	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	change	 the 	 ir 	 	sexual	behavior	more	?
and	the	way	that	i	'm	going	to	do	that	is	,	i	'm	going	to	look	 a 	 cross 	 	 area 	 s 	 	with	different	 level 	 s 	 	of	malaria	.
so	malaria	is	a	disease	that	 kill 	 s 	 	you	.
it	's	a	disease	that	 kill 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 adult 	 s 	 	in	africa	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	a	lot	of	children	.
and	so	people	who	live	in	 area 	 s 	 	with	a	lot	of	malaria	are	going	to	have	lower	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	than	people	who	live	in	 area 	 s 	 	with	 limit 	 ed 	 	malaria	.
so	one	way	to	test	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	we	can	explain	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	change	by	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	is	to	look	and	see	is	there	more	behavior	change	in	 area 	 s 	 	where	there	's	less	malaria	.
so	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	figure	 show 	 s 	 	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	you	--	in	 area 	 s 	 	with	low	malaria	,	medium	malaria	,	high	malaria	--	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	number	of	sexual	 partner 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	 in 	 crease 	 	hiv	 pre 	 valence 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	blue	line	,	the	 area 	 s 	 	with	low	 level 	 s 	 	of	malaria	,	you	can	see	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	number	of	sexual	 partner 	 s 	 	is	 decr 	 eas 	 ing 	 	a	lot	 a 	 s 	 	hiv	 pre 	 valence 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	.
 area 	 s 	 	with	medium	 level 	 s 	 	of	malaria	it	 de 	 crease 	 s 	 	some	--	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 de 	 crease 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	.	and	 area 	 s 	 	with	high	 level 	 s 	 	of	malaria	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	increasing	a	little	bit	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	that	's	not	significant	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	through	malaria	.
young	women	who	live	in	 area 	 s 	 	with	high	 ma 	 ternal 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	change	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	less	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	hiv	than	young	women	who	live	in	 area 	 s 	 	with	low	 ma 	 ternal 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	risk	,	and	they	respond	less	to	 th 	 is 	 	 exist 	 ing 	 	risk	.
so	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	a	lot	about	how	people	 behav 	 e 	 	.
it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 some 	 thing 	 	about	why	we	see	 limit 	 ed 	 	behavior	change	in	africa	.
but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 some 	 thing 	 	about	policy	.
even	if	you	 on 	 ly 	 	 car 	 ed 	 	about	 aid 	 s 	 	in	africa	,	it	might	still	be	a	good	idea	to	invest	in	malaria	,	in	 combat 	 ing 	 	poor	 in 	 door 	 	air	quality	,	in	 improv 	 ing 	 	 ma 	 ternal 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rates	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	improve	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	then	people	are	going	to	have	an	incentive	to	avoid	 aid 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 some 	 thing 	 	about	one	of	these	 fact 	 s 	 	that	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	before	.
education	 campaign 	 s 	 	,	like	the	one	that	the	 p 	 resident 	 	is	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	in	his	 fund 	 ing 	 	,	may	not	be	 en 	 ough 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	 al 	 one 	 	.
if	people	have	no	incentive	to	avoid	 aid 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	,	even	if	they	know	 every 	 thing 	 	about	the	disease	,	they	still	may	not	change	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
so	the	other	thing	that	i	think	we	learn	here	is	that	 aid 	 s 	 	is	not	going	to	fix	 it 	 self 	 	.
people	are	n't	changing	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 de 	 crease 	 	the	growth	in	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
so	we	're	going	to	need	to	think	about	policy	and	what	kind	of	 poli 	 cies 	 	might	be	effective	.
and	a	great	way	to	learn	about	policy	is	to	look	at	what	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	.
the	reason	that	we	know	that	the	abc	campaign	was	effective	in	uganda	is	we	have	good	data	on	 pre 	 valence 	 	over	time	.
in	uganda	we	see	the	 pre 	 valence 	 	went	down	.
we	know	they	had	 th 	 is 	 	campaign	.	that	's	how	we	learn	about	what	 work 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	we	had	any	 intervention 	 s 	 	.
other	 place 	 s 	 	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	so	why	do	n't	we	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	and	see	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 pre 	 valence 	 	?
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	 al 	 most 	 	no	good	data	on	hiv	 pre 	 valence 	 	in	the	general	population	in	africa	 un 	 til 	 	about	2003	.
so	if	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	,	``	why	do	n't	you	go	and	find	me	the	 pre 	 valence 	 	in	burkina	faso	in	1991	?	``
you	get	on	google	,	you	google	,	and	you	find	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	tested	in	burkina	faso	in	1991	are	std	 patient 	 s 	 	and	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	,	which	is	not	a	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 represent 	 ative 	 	group	of	people	.
then	if	you	 poke 	 d 	 	a	little	more	,	you	 look 	 ed 	 	a	little	more	at	what	was	going	on	,	you	'd	find	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	year	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	some	 year 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	tested	are	iv	drug	 user 	 s 	 	.
but	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	--	some	 year 	 s 	 	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	iv	drug	 user 	 s 	 	,	some	 year 	 s 	 	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	.
we	have	no	way	to	figure	out	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	over	time	.
we	have	no	 consist 	 ent 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	.
now	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	some	good	 test 	 ing 	 	.
in	kenya	,	in	zambia	,	and	a	bunch	of	 count 	 ries 	 	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	in	random	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	population	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	us	with	a	big	gap	in	our	knowledge	.
so	i	can	tell	you	what	the	 pre 	 valence 	 	was	in	kenya	in	2003	,	but	i	ca	n't	tell	you	 any 	 thing 	 	about	1993	or	1983	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	for	policy	.	it	was	a	problem	for	my	research	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	else	might	we	figure	out	what	the	 pre 	 valence 	 	of	hiv	was	in	africa	in	the	past	.
and	i	think	that	the	answer	is	,	we	can	look	at	 mortal 	 ity 	 	data	,	and	we	can	use	 mortal 	 ity 	 	data	to	figure	out	what	the	 pre 	 valence 	 	was	in	the	past	.
to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	the	fact	that	 aid 	 s 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	kind	of	disease	.
it	 kill 	 s 	 	people	in	the	prime	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
not	a	lot	of	other	 disease 	 s 	 	have	that	profile	.	and	you	can	see	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	of	death	rates	by	age	in	botswana	and	egypt	.
botswana	is	a	place	with	a	lot	of	 aid 	 s 	 	,	egypt	is	a	place	 with 	 out 	 	a	lot	of	 aid 	 s 	 	.
and	you	see	they	have	 pre 	 tty 	 	similar	death	rates	among	young	 kid 	 s 	 	and	old	people	.
that	 suggest 	 s 	 	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	similar	 level 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	middle	region	,	between	20	and	45	,	the	death	rates	in	botswana	are	much	,	much	,	much	 high 	 er 	 	than	in	egypt	.
but	since	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	other	 disease 	 s 	 	that	kill	people	,	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	 attribut 	 e 	 	that	 mortal 	 ity 	 	to	hiv	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	people	who	 di 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	of	 aid 	 s 	 	got	it	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	data	on	 mortal 	 ity 	 	to	figure	out	what	hiv	 pre 	 valence 	 	was	in	the	past	.
so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	if	you	use	 th 	 is 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	your	 estimate 	 s 	 	of	 pre 	 valence 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	what	we	get	from	 test 	 ing 	 	random	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	in	the	population	,	but	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	than	what	unaids	 tell 	 s 	 	us	the	 pre 	 valence 	 s 	 	are	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	of	 pre 	 valence 	 	 estimate 	 d 	 	by	unaids	,	and	 pre 	 valence 	 	based	on	the	 mortal 	 ity 	 	data	for	the	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	late	1990s	in	nine	 count 	 ries 	 	in	africa	.
you	can	see	,	 al 	 most 	 	 with 	 out 	 	exception	,	the	unaids	 estimate 	 s 	 	are	much	 high 	 er 	 	than	the	 mortal 	 ity 	 	-	based	 estimate 	 s 	 	.
unaids	tell	us	that	the	hiv	rate	in	zambia	is	20	percent	,	and	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	suggest	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	5	percent	.
and	these	are	not	trivial	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rates	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	way	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	can	see	that	for	the	 pre 	 valence 	 	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	unaids	 say 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	see	60	 death 	 s 	 	per	10,000	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	20	 death 	 s 	 	per	10,000	in	 th 	 is 	 	age	group	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	a	little	bit	in	a	minute	about	how	we	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	information	to	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	going	to	help	us	think	about	the	world	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	one	of	these	 fact 	 s 	 	that	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	may	not	be	 quit 	 e 	 	right	.
if	you	think	that	25	million	people	are	 infect 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	think	that	the	unaids	 number 	 s 	 	are	much	too	high	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	more	like	10	or	15	million	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	 aid 	 s 	 	is	n't	a	problem	.	it	's	a	 gig 	 antic 	 	problem	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	suggest	that	that	number	might	be	a	little	big	.
what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	do	,	is	i	want	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	new	data	to	try	to	figure	out	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	hiv	 epi 	 demic 	 	grow	 fast 	 er 	 	or	 s 	 lower 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	i	was	n't	going	to	tell	you	about	 export 	 s 	 	.
when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	these	 project 	 s 	 	,	i	was	not	 think 	 ing 	 	at	all	about	 economic 	 s 	 	,	but	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	it	kind	of	 suck 	 s 	 	you	back	in	.
so	i	am	going	to	talk	about	 export 	 s 	 	and	 price 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	to	talk	about	the	relationship	between	economic	activity	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	export	volume	,	and	hiv	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
so	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	economist	,	i	'm	 deep 	 ly 	 	familiar	with	the	fact	that	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	that	 open 	 ness 	 	to	trade	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	good	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
it	's	good	for	 improv 	 ing 	 	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	 open 	 ness 	 	and	inter	-	 connect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	with	a	cost	when	we	think	about	disease	.	i	do	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	should	be	a	surprise	.
on	wednesday	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	laurie	garrett	that	i	'm	 definite 	 ly 	 	going	to	get	the	bird	flu	,	and	i	would	n't	be	at	all	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	that	if	we	never	had	any	contact	with	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
and	hiv	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	linked	to	transit	.
the	 epi 	 demic 	 	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	the	us	by	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	male	steward	on	an	 air 	 line 	 	flight	,	who	got	the	disease	in	africa	and	 br 	 ought 	 	it	back	.
and	that	was	the	genesis	of	the	entire	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	the	us	.
in	africa	,	 epidemio 	 logists 	 	have	 not 	 ed 	 	for	a	long	time	that	truck	 driver 	 s 	 	and	 migrant 	 s 	 	are	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 infect 	 ed 	 	than	other	people	.
 area 	 s 	 	with	a	lot	of	economic	activity	--	with	a	lot	of	 road 	 s 	 	,	with	a	lot	of	 urban 	 ization 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 area 	 s 	 	have	 high 	 er 	 	 pre 	 valence 	 	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
but	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	at	all	that	if	we	 g 	 ave 	 	people	more	 export 	 s 	 	,	more	trade	,	that	that	would	 in 	 crease 	 	 pre 	 valence 	 	.
by	using	 th 	 is 	 	new	data	,	using	 th 	 is 	 	information	about	 pre 	 valence 	 	over	time	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	test	that	.	and	so	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	--	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	--	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	the	case	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 positive 	 ly 	 	related	.
more	 export 	 s 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	more	 aid 	 s 	 	.	and	that	effect	is	 re 	 ally 	 	big	.
so	the	data	that	i	have	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	if	you	double	export	volume	,	it	will	lead	to	a	 quad 	 rup 	 ling 	 	of	new	hiv	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	both	for	 fore 	 cast 	 ing 	 	and	for	policy	.
from	a	 fore 	 cast 	 ing 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	if	we	know	where	trade	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	change	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	african	growth	and	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	act	or	other	 poli 	 cies 	 	that	 encourag 	 e 	 	trade	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	about	which	 area 	 s 	 	are	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 heav 	 ily 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	hiv	.
and	we	can	go	and	we	can	try	to	have	pre	-	emptive	 prevent 	 ive 	 	 measure 	 s 	 	there	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	 poli 	 cies 	 	to	try	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	 export 	 s 	 	,	if	we	know	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 external 	 ity 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	extra	thing	that	's	going	to	happen	 a 	 s 	 	we	 in 	 crease 	 	 export 	 s 	 	--	we	can	think	about	what	the	right	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 poli 	 cies 	 	are	.
but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 some 	 thing 	 	about	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	think	that	we	know	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	is	the	case	that	poverty	is	linked	to	 aid 	 s 	 	,	in	the	sense	that	africa	is	poor	and	they	have	a	lot	of	 aid 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	the	case	that	 improv 	 ing 	 	poverty	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	short	run	,	that	 improv 	 ing 	 	 export 	 s 	 	and	 improv 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	--	it	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	the	case	that	that	's	going	to	lead	to	a	decline	in	hiv	 pre 	 valence 	 	.
so	 through 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	i	've	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	the	special	case	of	uganda	,	and	the	fact	that	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	country	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	with	 success 	 ful 	 	 prevent 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	 herald 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 replicate 	 d 	 	in	kenya	,	and	tanzania	,	and	south	africa	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
but	now	i	want	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	question	that	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	true	that	there	was	a	decline	in	 pre 	 valence 	 	in	uganda	in	the	1990s	.	it	's	true	that	they	had	an	education	campaign	.
but	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	uganda	in	 th 	 is 	 	period	.
there	was	a	big	decline	in	coffee	 price 	 s 	 	.
coffee	is	uganda	's	major	export	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 export 	 s 	 	went	down	a	lot	in	the	early	1990s	--	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	decline	lines	up	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	decline	in	new	hiv	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
so	you	can	see	that	both	of	these	 s 	 eries 	 	--	the	black	line	is	export	value	,	the	red	line	is	new	hiv	 infect 	 ions 	 	--	you	can	see	they	're	both	increasing	.
 start 	 ing 	 	about	1987	they	're	both	going	down	a	lot	.
and	then	 actual 	 ly 	 	they	track	each	other	a	little	bit	on	the	 in 	 crease 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	the	decade	.
so	if	you	combine	the	 intuit 	 ion 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	figure	with	some	of	the	data	that	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	before	,	it	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	 some 	 where 	 	between	25	percent	and	50	percent	of	the	decline	in	 pre 	 valence 	 	in	uganda	 actual 	 ly 	 	would	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	even	 with 	 out 	 	any	education	campaign	.
but	that	's	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	policy	.
we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	so	much	money	to	try	to	replicate	 th 	 is 	 	campaign	.
and	if	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	50	percent	 a 	 s 	 	effective	 a 	 s 	 	we	think	that	it	was	,	then	there	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	be	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	our	money	on	 in 	 stead 	 	.
 try 	 ing 	 	to	change	 trans 	 mission 	 	rates	by	 treat 	 ing 	 	other	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	.
 try 	 ing 	 	to	change	them	by	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	male	 circum 	 cis 	 ion 	 	.
there	are	 ton 	 s 	 	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	should	think	about	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	we	should	be	 think 	 ing 	 	more	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	hope	that	in	the	last	16	 minute 	 s 	 	i	've	told	you	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	did	n't	know	about	 aid 	 s 	 	,	and	i	hope	that	i	've	gotten	you	 question 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	did	know	.
and	i	hope	that	i	've	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	you	 may 	 be 	 	that	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	order	to	think	about	policy	.
but	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	,	you	know	,	i	'm	an	academic	.
and	when	i	 leav 	 e 	 	here	,	i	'm	going	to	go	back	and	 s 	 it 	 	in	my	 tin 	 y 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	,	and	my	computer	,	and	my	data	.
and	the	thing	that	's	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	about	that	is	every	time	i	think	about	research	,	there	are	more	 question 	 s 	 	.
there	are	more	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	think	that	i	want	to	do	.
and	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	great	about	 be 	 ing 	 	here	is	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	than	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	i	think	up	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	i	ca	n't	wait	to	hear	about	what	they	are	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
