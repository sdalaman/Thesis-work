i	'm	here	to	talk	about	the	wonder	and	the	 myster 	 y 	 	of	conscious	 mind 	 s 	 	.
the	wonder	is	about	the	fact	that	we	all	 wok 	 e 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	we	had	with	it	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	return	of	our	conscious	mind	.
we	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	with	a	complete	sense	of	self	and	a	complete	sense	of	our	own	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	yet	we	 hard 	 ly 	 	ever	pause	to	consider	 th 	 is 	 	wonder	.
we	should	,	in	fact	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	conscious	 mind 	 s 	 	,	we	would	have	no	knowledge	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	about	our	 human 	 ity 	 	;	we	would	have	no	knowledge	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	about	the	world	.
we	would	have	no	 pain 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	no	 joy 	 s 	 	.
we	would	have	no	access	to	love	or	to	the	ability	to	create	.
and	of	course	,	scott	fitzgerald	 s 	 aid 	 	 famous 	 ly 	 	that	``	he	who	 invent 	 ed 	 	 conscious 	 ness 	 	would	have	a	lot	to	be	 blame 	 d 	 	for	.	``
but	he	 al 	 so 	 	 for 	 got 	 	that	 with 	 out 	 	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	he	would	have	no	access	to	true	happiness	and	even	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 transcend 	 ence 	 	.
so	much	for	the	wonder	,	now	for	the	 myster 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 myster 	 y 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	hard	to	 elucid 	 ate 	 	.
all	the	way	back	 in 	 to 	 	early	 philosoph 	 y 	 	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 neuro 	 science 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	one	 myster 	 y 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 resist 	 ed 	 	 elucid 	 ation 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	got	major	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 ies 	 	.
and	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	that	think	we	should	not	even	touch	it	;	we	should	just	 leav 	 e 	 	it	 al 	 one 	 	,	it	's	not	to	be	 solve 	 d 	 	.
i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	,	and	i	think	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	changing	.
it	would	be	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	to	claim	that	we	know	how	we	make	 conscious 	 ness 	 	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	,	but	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	can	begin	to	approach	the	question	,	and	we	can	begin	to	see	the	shape	of	a	solution	.
and	one	more	wonder	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	is	the	fact	that	we	have	 im 	 aging 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	now	allow	us	to	go	 in 	 side 	 	the	human	brain	and	be	able	to	do	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	right	now	.
these	are	 image 	 s 	 	that	come	from	hanna	damasio	's	lab	,	and	which	show	you	,	in	a	living	brain	,	the	 re 	 construction 	 	of	that	brain	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	person	who	is	 al 	 ive 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	person	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	at	 au 	 topsy 	 	.
and	even	more	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	one	can	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	about	--	is	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	next	,	which	is	going	 under 	 neath 	 	the	surface	of	the	brain	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	in	the	living	brain	at	real	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	real	 path 	 ways 	 	.
so	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	lines	correspond	to	 bunch 	 es 	 	of	 axon 	 s 	 	,	the	 fiber 	 s 	 	that	join	cell	bodies	to	 synapse 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	sorry	to	disappoint	you	,	they	do	n't	come	in	color	.
but	at	any	rate	,	they	are	there	.
the	 color 	 s 	 	are	 code 	 s 	 	for	the	direction	,	from	 whet 	 her 	 	it	is	back	to	front	or	vice	versa	.
at	any	rate	,	what	is	 conscious 	 ness 	 	?
what	is	a	conscious	mind	?
and	we	could	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	view	and	say	,	well	,	it	is	that	which	we	lose	when	we	fall	 in 	 to 	 	deep	sleep	 with 	 out 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	,	or	when	we	go	under	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	,	and	it	is	what	we	regain	when	we	 re 	 cover 	 	from	sleep	or	from	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	.
but	what	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	stuff	that	we	lose	under	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	,	or	when	we	are	in	deep	,	 dream 	 less 	 	sleep	?
well	first	of	all	,	it	is	a	mind	,	which	is	a	flow	of	mental	 image 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	consider	 image 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 sensor 	 y 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	visual	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	right	now	in	relation	to	the	stage	and	me	,	or	 audit 	 ory 	 	 image 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	now	in	relation	to	my	 word 	 s 	 	.
that	flow	of	mental	 image 	 s 	 	is	mind	.
but	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	we	are	all	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
we	are	not	 pass 	 ive 	 	 exhibit 	 ors 	 	of	visual	or	 audit 	 ory 	 	or	 tact 	 ile 	 	 image 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	have	a	me	that	is	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	present	in	our	 mind 	 s 	 	right	now	.
we	own	our	 mind 	 s 	 	.
and	we	have	a	sense	that	it	's	 every 	 one 	 	of	us	that	is	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	not	the	person	who	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	you	.
so	in	order	to	have	a	conscious	mind	,	you	have	a	self	 with 	 in 	 	the	conscious	mind	.
so	a	conscious	mind	is	a	mind	with	a	self	in	it	.
the	self	 introduc 	 es 	 	the	 subject 	 ive 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	in	the	mind	,	and	we	are	 on 	 ly 	 	fully	conscious	when	self	 come 	 s 	 	to	mind	.
so	what	we	need	to	know	to	even	address	 th 	 is 	 	 myster 	 y 	 	is	,	number	one	,	how	are	 mind 	 s 	 	are	put	together	in	the	brain	,	and	,	number	two	,	how	 s 	 elves 	 	are	 construct 	 ed 	 	.
now	the	first	part	,	the	first	problem	,	is	 relat 	 ively 	 	easy	--	it	's	not	easy	at	all	--	but	it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 approach 	 ed 	 	 gradu 	 ally 	 	in	 neuro 	 science 	 	.
and	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	clear	that	,	in	order	to	make	 mind 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	construct	neural	 map 	 s 	 	.
so	imagine	a	grid	,	like	the	one	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	right	now	,	and	now	imagine	,	 with 	 in 	 	that	grid	,	that	two	-	dimensional	sheet	,	imagine	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
and	picture	,	if	you	will	,	a	 bill 	 board 	 	,	a	digital	 bill 	 board 	 	,	where	you	have	 element 	 s 	 	that	can	be	either	lit	or	not	.
and	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	you	create	the	pattern	of	 light 	 ing 	 	or	not	 light 	 ing 	 	,	the	digital	 element 	 s 	 	,	or	,	for	that	matter	,	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	the	sheet	,	you	're	going	to	be	able	to	construct	a	map	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	is	a	visual	map	that	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	 appli 	 es 	 	to	any	kind	of	map	--	 audit 	 ory 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	relation	to	sound	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	,	or	to	the	 map 	 s 	 	that	we	construct	with	our	skin	in	relation	to	an	object	that	we	 palp 	 ate 	 	.
now	to	 br 	 ing 	 	home	the	point	of	how	close	it	is	--	the	relationship	between	the	grid	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	the	 topo 	 graphical 	 	 arrange 	 ment 	 	of	the	activity	of	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	our	mental	experience	--	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	personal	story	.
so	if	i	cover	my	left	eye	--	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	me	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	not	all	of	you	--	if	i	cover	my	left	eye	,	i	look	at	the	grid	--	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	like	the	one	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	.
 every 	 thing 	 	is	nice	and	fine	and	 per 	 pend 	 icular 	 	.
but	 some 	 time 	 	ago	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	if	i	cover	my	left	eye	,	 in 	 stead 	 	what	i	get	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	look	at	the	grid	and	i	see	a	 warp 	 ing 	 	at	the	edge	of	my	central	-	left	field	.
 ver 	 y 	 	odd	--	i	've	 analyz 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	while	.
but	 some 	 time 	 	ago	,	through	the	help	of	an	 opthamo 	 logist 	 	 col 	 league 	 	of	mine	,	carmen	puliafito	,	who	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	laser	scanner	of	the	retina	,	i	found	out	the	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	.
if	i	 s 	 can 	 	my	retina	through	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	plane	that	you	see	there	in	the	little	corner	,	what	i	get	is	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	.
on	the	right	side	,	my	retina	is	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	.
you	see	the	going	down	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	fovea	where	the	optic	nerve	 begin 	 s 	 	.
but	on	my	left	retina	there	is	a	bump	,	which	is	 mark 	 ed 	 	there	by	the	red	arrow	.
and	it	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	a	little	cyst	that	is	 locate 	 d 	 	 be 	 low 	 	.
and	that	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 cause 	 s 	 	the	 warp 	 ing 	 	of	my	visual	image	.
so	just	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	:	you	have	a	grid	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	and	now	you	have	a	plane	 mechanic 	 al 	 	change	in	the	position	of	the	grid	,	and	you	get	a	 warp 	 ing 	 	of	your	mental	experience	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	close	your	mental	experience	and	the	activity	of	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	the	retina	,	which	is	a	part	of	the	brain	 locate 	 d 	 	in	the	 eye 	 ball 	 	,	or	,	for	that	matter	,	a	sheet	of	visual	cortex	.
so	from	the	retina	you	go	onto	visual	cortex	.
and	of	course	,	the	brain	 add 	 s 	 	on	a	lot	of	information	to	what	is	going	on	in	the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	come	from	the	retina	.
and	in	that	image	there	,	you	see	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	of	what	i	call	image	-	making	 region 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
you	have	the	green	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	that	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	 tact 	 ile 	 	information	,	or	the	blue	that	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	 audit 	 ory 	 	information	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	 t 	 hose 	 	image	-	making	 region 	 s 	 	where	you	have	the	 plot 	 ting 	 	of	all	these	neural	 map 	 s 	 	,	can	then	provide	 signal 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	ocean	of	 pur 	 ple 	 	that	you	see	around	,	which	is	the	 associ 	 ation 	 	cortex	,	where	you	can	make	 record 	 s 	 	of	what	went	on	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	of	image	-	making	.
and	the	great	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	that	you	can	then	go	from	 memor 	 y 	 	,	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 associ 	 ation 	 	 cort 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	and	produce	back	 image 	 s 	 	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	 region 	 s 	 	that	have	 per 	 ception 	 	.
so	think	about	how	 wonder 	 fully 	 	convenient	and	 laz 	 y 	 	the	brain	is	.
so	it	 provide 	 s 	 	certain	 area 	 s 	 	for	 per 	 ception 	 	and	image	-	making	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	that	are	going	to	be	used	for	image	-	making	when	we	recall	information	.
so	far	the	 myster 	 y 	 	of	the	conscious	mind	is	 diminish 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	a	general	sense	of	how	we	make	these	 image 	 s 	 	.
but	what	about	the	self	?
the	self	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	elusive	problem	.
and	for	a	long	time	,	people	did	not	even	want	to	touch	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	'd	say	,	``	how	can	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ference 	 	point	,	 th 	 is 	 	 st 	 ability 	 	,	that	is	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	maintain	the	 continu 	 ity 	 	of	 s 	 elves 	 	day	after	day	?	``
and	i	thought	about	a	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
it	's	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	.
we	generate	brain	 map 	 s 	 	of	the	body	's	 in 	 terior 	 	and	use	them	 a 	 s 	 	the	 re 	 ference 	 	for	all	other	 map 	 s 	 	.
so	let	me	tell	you	just	a	little	bit	about	how	i	came	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	came	to	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	're	going	to	have	a	 re 	 ference 	 	that	we	know	 a 	 s 	 	self	--	the	me	,	the	i	in	our	own	 process 	 ing 	 	--	we	need	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 s 	 table 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	 dev 	 iate 	 	much	from	day	to	day	.
well	it	so	 happen 	 s 	 	that	we	have	a	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 	body	.
we	have	one	body	,	not	two	,	not	three	.
and	so	that	is	a	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
there	is	just	one	 re 	 ference 	 	point	,	which	is	the	body	.
but	then	,	of	course	,	the	body	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 part 	 s 	 	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	grow	at	different	rates	,	and	they	have	different	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	and	different	people	;	 how 	 ever 	 	,	not	so	with	the	 in 	 terior 	 	.
the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	to	do	with	what	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	our	internal	milieu	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	whole	management	of	the	 chemist 	 ries 	 	 with 	 in 	 	our	body	are	,	in	fact	,	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 maintain 	 ed 	 	day	after	day	for	one	 ver 	 y 	 	good	reason	.
if	you	 dev 	 iate 	 	too	much	in	the	 parameter 	 s 	 	that	are	close	to	the	 mid 	 line 	 	of	that	life	-	permitting	 surviv 	 al 	 	range	,	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	disease	or	death	.
so	we	have	an	in	-	built	system	 with 	 in 	 	our	own	 live 	 s 	 	that	 ensure 	 s 	 	some	kind	of	 continu 	 ity 	 	.
i	like	to	call	it	an	 al 	 most 	 	infinite	 same 	 ness 	 	from	day	to	day	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	do	n't	have	that	 same 	 ness 	 	,	 physiologic 	 ally 	 	,	you	're	going	to	be	sick	or	you	're	going	to	die	.
so	that	's	one	more	element	for	 th 	 is 	 	 continu 	 ity 	 	.
and	the	final	thing	is	that	there	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tight	 coup 	 ling 	 	between	the	 regulat 	 ion 	 	of	our	body	 with 	 in 	 	the	brain	and	the	body	 it 	 self 	 	,	 un 	 like 	 	any	other	 coup 	 ling 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	'm	making	 image 	 s 	 	of	you	,	but	there	's	no	 physiologic 	 al 	 	bond	between	the	 image 	 s 	 	i	have	of	you	 a 	 s 	 	an	audience	and	my	brain	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	there	is	a	close	,	 permanent 	 ly 	 	 maintain 	 ed 	 	bond	between	the	body	 regulat 	 ing 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	my	brain	and	my	own	body	.
so	here	's	how	it	 look 	 s 	 	.	look	at	the	region	there	.
there	is	the	brain	stem	in	between	the	cerebral	cortex	and	the	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	.
and	it	is	 with 	 in 	 	that	region	that	i	'm	going	to	 high 	 light 	 	now	that	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	housing	of	all	the	life	-	 regulat 	 ion 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	of	the	body	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	so	specific	that	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	part	that	is	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	red	in	the	upper	part	of	the	brain	stem	,	if	you	damage	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	a	stroke	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	what	you	get	is	 com 	 a 	 	or	 veget 	 ative 	 	state	,	which	is	a	state	,	of	course	,	in	which	your	mind	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	your	 conscious 	 ness 	 	 disappear 	 s 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	then	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	that	you	lose	the	 ground 	 ing 	 	of	the	self	,	you	have	no	 long 	 er 	 	access	to	any	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	your	own	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	and	,	in	fact	,	there	can	be	 image 	 s 	 	going	on	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	in	the	cerebral	cortex	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	you	do	n't	know	they	're	there	.
you	have	,	in	effect	,	lost	 conscious 	 ness 	 	when	you	have	damage	to	that	red	section	of	the	brain	stem	.
but	if	you	consider	the	green	part	of	the	brain	stem	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	that	 happen 	 s 	 	.
it	is	that	specific	.
so	in	that	green	component	of	the	brain	stem	,	if	you	damage	it	,	and	often	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	what	you	get	is	complete	 para 	 lysis 	 	,	but	your	conscious	mind	is	 maintain 	 ed 	 	.
you	feel	,	you	know	,	you	have	a	fully	conscious	mind	that	you	can	report	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 horr 	 ific 	 	condition	.	you	do	n't	want	to	see	it	.
and	people	are	,	in	fact	,	 imprison 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	bodies	,	but	they	do	have	a	mind	.
there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	film	,	one	of	the	rare	good	 film 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	about	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	by	julian	schnabel	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	about	a	patient	that	was	in	that	condition	.
so	now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	picture	.
i	promise	not	to	say	 any 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	frighten	you	.
it	's	just	to	tell	you	that	in	that	red	section	of	the	brain	stem	,	there	are	,	to	make	it	simple	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 square 	 s 	 	that	correspond	to	 modul 	 es 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	brain	 map 	 s 	 	of	different	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	our	 in 	 terior 	 	,	different	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	our	body	.
they	are	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	 topo 	 graphic 	 	and	they	are	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	in	a	 recur 	 s 	 ive 	 	pattern	.
and	it	is	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	tight	 coup 	 ling 	 	between	the	brain	stem	and	the	body	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	--	and	i	could	be	wrong	,	but	i	do	n't	think	i	am	--	that	you	generate	 th 	 is 	 	mapping	of	the	body	that	 provide 	 s 	 	the	 ground 	 ing 	 	for	the	self	and	that	 come 	 s 	 	in	the	form	of	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	primordial	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	.
so	what	is	the	picture	that	we	get	here	?
look	at	``	cerebral	cortex	,	``	look	at	``	brain	stem	,	``	look	at	``	body	,	``	and	you	get	the	picture	of	the	 interconnect 	 ivity 	 	in	which	you	have	the	brain	stem	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	the	 ground 	 ing 	 	for	the	self	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tight	 interconnect 	 ion 	 	with	the	body	.
and	you	have	the	cerebral	cortex	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	the	great	 spect 	 acle 	 	of	our	 mind 	 s 	 	with	the	 pro 	 fusion 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	that	are	,	in	fact	,	the	 content 	 s 	 	of	our	 mind 	 s 	 	and	that	we	 normal 	 ly 	 	pay	most	attention	to	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	should	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	film	that	is	 roll 	 ing 	 	in	our	 mind 	 s 	 	.
but	look	at	the	 arrow 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	there	for	 look 	 s 	 	.
they	're	there	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	close	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
you	can	not	have	a	conscious	mind	if	you	do	n't	have	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	between	cerebral	cortex	and	brain	stem	.
you	can	not	have	a	conscious	mind	if	you	do	n't	have	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	between	the	brain	stem	and	the	body	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	brain	stem	that	we	have	is	 share 	 d 	 	with	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	other	species	.
so	 through 	 out 	 	 vertebrate 	 s 	 	,	the	design	of	the	brain	stem	is	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	 our 	 s 	 	,	which	is	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	i	think	 t 	 hose 	 	other	species	have	conscious	 mind 	 s 	 	like	we	do	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	that	they	're	not	 a 	 s 	 	rich	 a 	 s 	 	 our 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	a	cerebral	cortex	like	we	do	.
that	's	where	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	.
and	i	 strong 	 ly 	 	disagree	with	the	idea	that	 conscious 	 ness 	 	should	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	great	product	of	the	cerebral	cortex	.
 on 	 ly 	 	the	wealth	of	our	 mind 	 s 	 	is	,	not	the	 ver 	 y 	 	fact	that	we	have	a	self	that	we	can	refer	to	our	own	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	and	that	we	have	any	sense	of	person	.
now	there	are	three	 level 	 s 	 	of	self	to	consider	--	the	proto	,	the	core	and	the	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	.
the	first	two	are	 share 	 d 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	other	species	,	and	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	coming	out	 large 	 ly 	 	of	the	brain	stem	and	 what 	 ever 	 	there	is	of	cortex	in	 t 	 hose 	 	species	.
it	's	the	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	self	which	some	species	have	,	i	think	.
cetaceans	and	 prim 	 ates 	 	have	 al 	 so 	 	an	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	self	to	a	certain	degree	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	's	 dog 	 s 	 	at	home	have	an	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	self	to	a	certain	degree	.
but	the	 novel 	 ty 	 	is	here	.
the	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	self	is	built	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	past	 memor 	 ies 	 	and	 memor 	 ies 	 	of	the	 plan 	 s 	 	that	we	have	made	;	it	's	the	lived	past	and	the	 anticip 	 ated 	 	future	.
and	the	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	self	 ha 	 s 	 	 prompt 	 ed 	 	 extend 	 ed 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	,	 reason 	 ing 	 	,	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	language	.
and	out	of	that	came	the	 instrument 	 s 	 	of	culture	--	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	justice	,	trade	,	the	 art 	 s 	 	,	science	,	technology	.
and	it	is	 with 	 in 	 	that	culture	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	can	get	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 novel 	 ty 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	set	by	our	biology	.
it	is	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	the	 culture 	 s 	 	.
it	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	 collect 	 ive 	 s 	 	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	the	culture	where	we	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	like	to	call	socio	-	cultural	 regulat 	 ion 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	you	could	 right 	 ly 	 	ask	,	why	care	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
why	care	if	it	is	the	brain	stem	or	the	cerebral	cortex	and	how	 th 	 is 	 	is	made	?
three	 reason 	 s 	 	.	first	,	curiosity	.
 prim 	 ates 	 	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	--	and	 human 	 s 	 	most	of	all	.
and	if	we	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	fact	that	anti	-	 gravit 	 y 	 	is	 pull 	 ing 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	away	from	the	earth	,	why	should	we	not	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	what	is	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	?
second	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	culture	.
we	should	look	at	how	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	culture	in	 th 	 is 	 	socio	-	cultural	 regulat 	 ion 	 	are	a	work	in	progress	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	medicine	.
let	's	not	forget	that	some	of	the	worst	 disease 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 kind 	 	are	 disease 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	alzheimer	's	disease	,	drug	 addict 	 ion 	 	.
think	of	 stroke 	 s 	 	that	can	 deva 	 state 	 	your	mind	or	render	you	 un 	 conscious 	 	.
you	have	no	 pray 	 er 	 	of	 treat 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	and	in	a	non	-	serendipitous	way	if	you	do	not	know	how	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	reason	beyond	curiosity	to	 just 	 ify 	 	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	to	 just 	 ify 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	some	interest	in	what	is	going	on	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	for	your	attention	.
