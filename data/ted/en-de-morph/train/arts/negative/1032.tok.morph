now	i	'm	going	to	give	you	a	story	.
it	's	an	indian	story	about	an	indian	woman	and	her	journey	.
let	me	begin	with	my	 parent 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	a	product	of	 th 	 is 	 	 vision 	 ary 	 	mother	and	father	.
 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	was	born	in	the	'50s	--	'50s	and	'60s	did	n't	belong	to	 girl 	 s 	 	in	india	.
they	 belong 	 ed 	 	to	 boy 	 s 	 	.
they	 belong 	 ed 	 	to	 boy 	 s 	 	who	would	join	business	and	inherit	business	from	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	 girl 	 s 	 	would	be	 doll 	 ed 	 	up	to	get	married	.
my	family	,	in	my	city	,	and	 al 	 most 	 	in	the	country	,	was	 un 	 ique 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	four	of	us	,	not	one	,	and	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	no	 boy 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	four	 girl 	 s 	 	and	no	 boy 	 s 	 	.
and	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	part	of	a	 land 	 ed 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	family	.
my	father	 defi 	 ed 	 	his	own	 grand 	 father 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	to	the	point	of	 dis 	 inherit 	 ance 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	all	four	of	us	.
he	 s 	 ent 	 	us	to	one	of	the	best	 school 	 s 	 	in	the	city	and	 g 	 ave 	 	us	the	best	education	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	,	when	we	're	born	,	we	do	n't	 choos 	 e 	 	our	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	when	we	go	to	school	,	we	do	n't	 choos 	 e 	 	our	school	.
children	do	n't	 choos 	 e 	 	a	school	.
they	just	get	the	school	which	 parent 	 s 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	for	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 found 	 ation 	 	time	which	i	got	.
i	grew	up	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	so	did	my	other	three	 sister 	 s 	 	.
and	my	father	used	to	say	at	that	time	,	``	i	'm	going	to	spread	all	my	four	 daughter 	 s 	 	in	four	 corner 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.	``
i	do	n't	know	if	he	 re 	 ally 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	[	that	]	,	but	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	'm	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	who	's	left	in	india	.
one	is	a	british	,	 an 	 other 	 	is	an	american	and	the	third	is	a	canadian	.
so	we	are	four	of	us	in	four	 corner 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
and	since	i	 s 	 aid 	 	they	're	my	role	 model 	 s 	 	,	i	 follow 	 ed 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	which	my	father	and	mother	 g 	 ave 	 	me	.
one	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	life	is	on	an	 inc 	 line 	 	.
you	either	go	up	,	or	you	come	down	.	``
and	the	second	thing	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	with	me	,	which	 be 	 came 	 	my	 philosoph 	 y 	 	of	life	,	which	made	all	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	is	:	100	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	in	your	life	,	good	or	bad	.
out	of	100	,	90	are	your	creation	.
they	're	good	.	they	're	your	creation	.	enjoy	it	.
if	they	're	bad	,	they	're	your	creation	.	learn	from	it	.
ten	are	nature	-	 s 	 ent 	 	over	which	you	ca	n't	do	a	thing	.
it	's	like	a	death	of	a	 relat 	 ive 	 	,	or	a	 cycl 	 one 	 	,	or	a	hurricane	,	or	an	 earth 	 quake 	 	.
you	ca	n't	do	a	thing	about	it	.
you	've	got	to	just	respond	to	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
but	that	 respons 	 e 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	90	 point 	 s 	 	.
since	i	'm	a	product	of	 th 	 is 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	of	90/10	,	and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	``	life	on	an	 inc 	 line 	 	,	``	that	's	the	way	i	grew	up	to	be	 valu 	 ing 	 	what	i	got	.
i	'm	a	product	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	,	rare	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	the	'50s	and	the	'60s	,	which	 girl 	 s 	 	did	n't	get	,	and	i	was	conscious	of	the	fact	that	what	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	giving	me	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	my	best	school	 friend 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 doll 	 ed 	 	up	to	get	married	with	a	lot	of	 do 	 wry 	 	,	and	here	i	was	with	a	tennis	 rack 	 et 	 	and	going	to	school	and	 do 	 ing 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	extracurricular	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
i	thought	i	must	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	.
why	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	is	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 come 	 s 	 	next	.
i	 join 	 ed 	 	the	indian	police	service	 a 	 s 	 	a	tough	woman	,	a	woman	with	 indefatig 	 able 	 	 stam 	 ina 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	used	to	run	for	my	tennis	 title 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
but	i	 join 	 ed 	 	the	indian	police	service	,	and	then	it	was	a	new	pattern	of	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	.
for	me	the	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	stood	for	power	to	correct	,	power	to	prevent	and	power	to	detect	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	new	definition	ever	 give 	 n 	 	in	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	in	india	--	the	power	to	prevent	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	power	to	detect	,	and	that	's	it	,	or	power	to	punish	.
but	i	 decide 	 d 	 	no	,	it	's	a	power	to	prevent	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	growing	up	.
how	do	i	prevent	the	10	and	never	make	it	more	than	10	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	how	it	came	 in 	 to 	 	my	service	,	and	it	was	different	from	the	men	.
i	did	n't	want	to	make	it	different	from	the	men	,	but	it	was	different	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	way	i	was	different	.
and	i	 re 	 defined 	 	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	in	india	.
i	'm	going	to	take	you	on	two	 journey 	 s 	 	,	my	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	journey	and	my	 pri 	 son 	 	journey	.
what	you	see	,	if	you	see	the	title	 call 	 ed 	 	``	pm	's	car	held	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	time	a	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	india	was	 give 	 n 	 	a	 park 	 ing 	 	ticket	.
that	's	the	first	time	in	india	,	and	i	can	tell	you	,	that	's	the	last	time	you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
it	'll	never	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	in	india	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	it	was	once	and	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
and	the	rule	was	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	sensitive	,	i	was	 com 	 passionate 	 	,	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	sensitive	to	 in 	 justice 	 	,	and	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	pro	-	justice	.
that	's	the	reason	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	woman	,	i	 join 	 ed 	 	the	indian	police	service	.
i	had	other	 option 	 s 	 	,	but	i	did	n't	 choos 	 e 	 	them	.
so	i	'm	going	to	move	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	tough	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	,	equal	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	.
now	i	was	known	 a 	 s 	 	``	here	's	a	woman	that	's	not	going	to	listen	.	``
so	i	was	 s 	 ent 	 	to	all	 in 	 discriminate 	 	 post 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 post 	 ing 	 s 	 	which	 other 	 s 	 	would	say	no	.
i	now	went	to	a	 pri 	 son 	 	 assign 	 ment 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	police	officer	.
 normal 	 ly 	 	police	 officer 	 s 	 	do	n't	want	to	do	 pri 	 son 	 	.
they	 s 	 ent 	 	me	to	 pri 	 son 	 	to	lock	me	up	,	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	now	there	will	be	no	 car 	 s 	 	and	no	vips	to	be	 give 	 n 	 	 ticket 	 s 	 	to	.
let	's	lock	her	up	.	``
here	i	got	a	 pri 	 son 	 	 assign 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 pri 	 son 	 	 assign 	 ment 	 	which	was	one	big	den	of	 criminal 	 s 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	.
but	10,000	men	,	of	which	 on 	 ly 	 	400	 we 	 re 	 	women	--	10,000	--	9,000	plus	about	600	 we 	 re 	 	men	.
 terrorist 	 s 	 	,	 rap 	 ists 	 	,	 burglar 	 s 	 	,	 gang 	 sters 	 	--	some	of	them	i	'd	 s 	 ent 	 	to	jail	 a 	 s 	 	a	police	officer	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	then	how	did	i	deal	with	them	?
the	first	day	when	i	went	in	,	i	did	n't	know	how	to	look	at	them	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	pray	?	``	when	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	group	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	pray	?	``
they	saw	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	,	short	woman	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	tan	suit	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	pray	?	``
and	they	did	n't	say	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	pray	?	do	you	want	to	pray	?	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	all	right	,	let	's	pray	.	``
i	 pray 	 ed 	 	for	them	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	change	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	visual	of	education	 in 	 side 	 	the	 pri 	 son 	 	.
 friend 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	where	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	 pri 	 son 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	community	support	.
government	had	no	budget	.
it	was	one	of	the	 fin 	 est 	 	,	largest	 volunteer 	 ism 	 	in	any	 pri 	 son 	 	in	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 initi 	 ated 	 	in	delhi	 pri 	 son 	 	.
you	see	one	 s 	 ample 	 	of	a	prisoner	 teach 	 ing 	 	a	class	.
these	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 class 	 es 	 	.
nine	to	eleven	,	every	prisoner	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	education	program	--	the	same	den	in	which	they	thought	they	would	put	me	 be 	 hind 	 	the	bar	and	 thing 	 s 	 	would	be	 for 	 gotten 	 	.
we	 convert 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 ash 	 ram 	 	--	from	a	 pri 	 son 	 	to	an	 ash 	 ram 	 	through	education	.
i	think	that	's	the	 big 	 ger 	 	change	.
it	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	a	change	.
 teacher 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	.	 teacher 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 volunteer 	 s 	 	.
 book 	 s 	 	came	from	 don 	 ated 	 	 school 	 book 	 s 	 	.
stationery	was	 don 	 ated 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	was	 don 	 ated 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	no	budget	of	education	for	the	 pri 	 son 	 	.
now	if	i	'd	not	 d 	 one 	 	that	,	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	 hell 	 hole 	 	.
that	's	the	second	 land 	 mark 	 	.
i	want	to	show	you	some	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	my	journey	,	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	you	would	never	ever	get	to	see	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
one	,	the	 number 	 s 	 	you	'll	never	get	to	see	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 medit 	 ation 	 	program	 in 	 side 	 	the	 pri 	 son 	 	of	over	1,000	 prisoner 	 s 	 	.
one	thousand	 prisoner 	 s 	 	who	 s 	 at 	 	in	 medit 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	most	 courage 	 ous 	 	 step 	 s 	 	i	took	 a 	 s 	 	a	 pri 	 son 	 	 govern 	 or 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 transform 	 ed 	 	.
you	want	to	know	more	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	go	and	see	 th 	 is 	 	film	,	``	 do 	 ing 	 	time	,	 do 	 ing 	 	vipassana	.	``
you	will	hear	about	it	,	and	you	will	love	it	.
and	write	to	me	on	kiranbedi.com	,	and	i	'll	respond	to	you	.
let	me	show	you	the	next	slide	.
i	took	the	same	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 mind 	 fulness 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	why	did	i	 br 	 ing 	 	 medit 	 ation 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	indian	 pri 	 son 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	crime	is	a	product	of	a	 distort 	 ed 	 	mind	.
it	was	 distort 	 ion 	 	of	mind	which	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	 address 	 ed 	 	to	control	.
not	by	 preach 	 ing 	 	,	not	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	not	by	 read 	 ing 	 	,	but	by	 address 	 ing 	 	your	mind	.
i	took	the	same	thing	to	the	police	,	 be 	 cause 	 	police	,	 equal 	 ly 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	,	and	they	felt	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	was	``	we	``	and	``	they	,	``	and	that	the	people	do	n't	cooperate	.
 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 feed 	 back 	 	box	 call 	 ed 	 	a	petition	box	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 con 	 cept 	 	which	i	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	listen	to	 complain 	 ts 	 	,	listen	to	 griev 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	magic	box	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	sensitive	box	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	a	prisoner	drew	how	they	felt	about	the	 pri 	 son 	 	.
if	you	see	 some 	 body 	 	in	the	blue	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	--	he	was	a	prisoner	,	and	he	was	a	teacher	.
and	you	see	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	 bus 	 y 	 	.	there	was	no	time	to	waste	.
let	me	wrap	it	up	.
i	'm	 current 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	,	 move 	 ments 	 	of	education	of	the	under	-	 serv 	 ed 	 	children	,	which	is	 thousand 	 s 	 	--	india	is	all	about	 thousand 	 s 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	is	about	the	anti	-	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	in	india	.
that	's	a	big	way	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	small	group	of	 activist 	 s 	 	,	have	 draft 	 ed 	 	an	 om 	 bud 	 s 	 man 	 	bill	for	the	government	of	india	.
 friend 	 s 	 	,	you	will	hear	a	lot	about	it	.
that	's	the	 move 	 ment 	 	at	the	moment	i	'm	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	's	the	 move 	 ment 	 	and	 ambit 	 ion 	 	of	my	life	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	thank	you	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	.	thank	you	.
