i	 move 	 d 	 	to	boston	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	from	chicago	,	with	an	interest	in	cancer	and	in	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
you	might	know	that	 chemist 	 ry 	 	is	the	science	of	making	 molecule 	 s 	 	--	or	to	my	taste	,	new	 drug 	 s 	 	for	cancer	.
and	you	might	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	,	for	science	and	medicine	,	boston	is	a	bit	of	a	 can 	 dy 	 	store	.
you	ca	n't	roll	a	stop	sign	in	cambridge	 with 	 out 	 	hitting	a	graduate	student	.
the	bar	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	miracle	of	science	.
the	 bill 	 board 	 s 	 	say	``	lab	space	 avail 	 able 	 	.	``
and	it	's	fair	to	say	that	in	these	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 witness 	 ed 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	the	start	of	a	scientific	revolution	--	that	of	genome	medicine	.
we	know	more	about	the	 patient 	 s 	 	that	enter	our	clinic	now	than	ever	before	.
and	we	're	able	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	to	answer	the	question	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	so	 press 	 ing 	 	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	:	why	do	i	have	cancer	?
 th 	 is 	 	information	is	 al 	 so 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 stagger 	 ing 	 	.
you	might	know	that	,	so	far	in	just	the	dawn	of	 th 	 is 	 	revolution	,	we	know	that	there	are	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	40,000	 un 	 ique 	 	 mutation 	 s 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	more	than	10,000	 gene 	 s 	 	,	and	that	there	are	500	of	these	 gene 	 s 	 	that	are	 bon 	 a 	 	-	fide	 driver 	 s 	 	,	 cause 	 s 	 	of	cancer	.
yet	 compar 	 ative 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	about	a	dozen	 target 	 ed 	 	 medic 	 ations 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 ad 	 equ 	 acy 	 	of	cancer	medicine	 re 	 ally 	 	hit	home	when	my	father	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 pan 	 cre 	 atic 	 	cancer	.
we	did	n't	fly	him	to	boston	.
we	did	n't	sequence	his	genome	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	known	for	 decade 	 s 	 	what	 cause 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 malign 	 ancy 	 	.
it	's	three	 protein 	 s 	 	--	ras	,	myc	and	p	53	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	old	information	we	've	known	since	about	the	80s	,	yet	there	's	no	medicine	i	can	 pre 	 scribe 	 	to	a	patient	with	 th 	 is 	 	or	any	of	the	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	solid	 tumor 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	these	three	horsemen	of	the	 apocalyp 	 s 	 e 	 	that	is	cancer	.
there	's	no	ras	,	no	myc	,	no	p	53	drug	.
and	you	might	 fair 	 ly 	 	ask	:	why	is	that	?
and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	unsatisfying	,	yet	scientific	,	answer	is	it	's	too	hard	.
that	for	 what 	 ever 	 	reason	,	these	three	 protein 	 s 	 	have	 enter 	 ed 	 	a	space	in	the	language	of	our	field	that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	undruggable	genome	--	which	is	like	 call 	 ing 	 	a	computer	unsurfable	or	the	moon	unwalkable	.
it	's	a	 horr 	 ible 	 	term	of	trade	.
but	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	we	fail	to	identify	a	 gr 	 easy 	 	pocket	in	these	 protein 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	which	we	,	like	 mole 	 cular 	 	locksmiths	,	can	fashion	an	active	,	small	,	 organ 	 ic 	 	molecule	or	drug	 sub 	 stance 	 	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	training	in	 clinic 	 al 	 	medicine	and	hematology	and	 onco 	 logy 	 	and	stem	cell	 transplant 	 ation 	 	,	what	we	had	 in 	 stead 	 	,	 cascad 	 ing 	 	through	the	 regulat 	 ory 	 	network	at	the	fda	,	 we 	 re 	 	these	 sub 	 stance 	 s 	 	--	arsenic	,	thalidomide	and	 th 	 is 	 	chemical	 deriv 	 ative 	 	of	nitrogen	 must 	 ard 	 	gas	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	21st	century	.
and	so	,	i	guess	you	'd	say	,	 dis 	 satisfied 	 	with	the	performance	and	quality	of	these	 medicine 	 s 	 	,	i	went	back	to	school	in	 chemist 	 ry 	 	with	the	idea	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	by	 learn 	 ing 	 	the	trade	of	 discover 	 y 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	and	 approach 	 ing 	 	it	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	brave	new	world	of	the	open	-	source	,	the	crowd	-	source	,	the	 collabor 	 ative 	 	network	that	we	have	access	to	 with 	 in 	 	academia	,	that	we	might	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	and	 target 	 ed 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	to	our	 patient 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 pleas 	 e 	 	consider	 th 	 is 	 	a	work	in	progress	,	but	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	 to 	 day 	 	a	story	about	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	cancer	 call 	 ed 	 	 mid 	 line 	 	 car 	 cinoma 	 	,	about	the	protein	target	,	the	undruggable	protein	target	that	 cause 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cancer	,	 call 	 ed 	 	brd	4	,	and	about	a	molecule	 develop 	 ed 	 	at	my	lab	at	dana	farber	cancer	institute	 call 	 ed 	 	jq	1	,	which	we	 affect 	 ion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	named	for	jun	qi	,	the	chemist	that	made	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	.
now	brd	4	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	protein	.
you	might	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	with	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	cancer	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	to	kill	our	patient	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	remember	it	's	cancer	?
when	it	 wind 	 s 	 	up	 it 	 s 	 	genome	,	 divide 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	two	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 wind 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	it	not	turn	 in 	 to 	 	an	eye	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	liver	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	all	the	 gene 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
it	 remember 	 s 	 	that	it	's	cancer	.
and	the	reason	is	that	cancer	,	like	every	cell	in	the	body	,	 place 	 s 	 	little	 mole 	 cular 	 	bookmarks	,	little	post	-	it	 note 	 s 	 	,	that	 re 	 mind 	 	the	cell	``	i	'm	cancer	;	i	should	keep	growing	.	``
and	 t 	 hose 	 	post	-	it	 note 	 s 	 	involve	 th 	 is 	 	and	other	 protein 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	class	--	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	bromodomains	.
so	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	an	idea	,	a	 rational 	 e 	 	,	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	if	we	made	a	molecule	that	 prevent 	 ed 	 	the	post	-	it	note	from	 stick 	 ing 	 	by	 enter 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	little	pocket	at	the	base	of	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 pinning 	 	protein	,	then	 may 	 be 	 	we	could	 con 	 vince 	 	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	brd	4	protein	,	that	they	're	not	cancer	.
and	so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
we	 develop 	 ed 	 	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	of	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	similar	 sub 	 stance 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	jq	1	.
now	not	 be 	 ing 	 	a	drug	company	,	we	could	do	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	had	certain	 flex 	 ibilities 	 	,	that	i	respect	that	a	pharmaceutical	industry	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	.
we	just	 start 	 ed 	 	 mail 	 ing 	 	it	to	our	 friend 	 s 	 	.
i	have	a	small	lab	.
we	thought	we	'd	just	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	people	and	see	how	the	molecule	 behav 	 es 	 	.
and	we	 s 	 ent 	 	it	to	oxford	,	england	where	a	group	of	 talent 	 ed 	 	crystallographers	 provide 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	which	 help 	 ed 	 	us	understand	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	is	so	potent	for	 th 	 is 	 	protein	target	.
it	's	what	we	call	a	perfect	fit	of	shape	complimentarity	,	or	hand	in	glove	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	cancer	,	 th 	 is 	 	brd	4	-	 addict 	 ed 	 	cancer	.
and	so	we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	material	that	 we 	 re 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	by	young	pathologists	at	brigham	women	's	hospital	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 treat 	 ed 	 	these	 cell 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	,	we	 observ 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	.
the	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	,	small	,	round	and	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 divid 	 ing 	 	,	grew	these	 arm 	 s 	 	and	 extens 	 ions 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	changing	shape	.
in	effect	,	the	cancer	cell	was	 forget 	 ting 	 	it	was	cancer	and	 be 	 coming 	 	a	normal	cell	.
 th 	 is 	 	got	us	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
the	next	step	would	be	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	 in 	 to 	 	 mic 	 e 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	problem	was	there	's	no	mouse	model	of	 th 	 is 	 	rare	cancer	.
and	so	at	the	time	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	research	,	i	was	 car 	 ing 	 	for	a	29	year	-	old	 fire 	 fight 	 er 	 	from	connecticut	who	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	at	the	end	of	life	with	 th 	 is 	 	 incur 	 able 	 	cancer	.
 th 	 is 	 	brd	4	-	 addict 	 ed 	 	cancer	was	growing	 through 	 out 	 	his	left	lung	,	and	he	had	a	chest	tube	in	that	was	 drain 	 ing 	 	little	bits	of	 deb 	 ris 	 	.
and	every	 nurs 	 ing 	 	shift	we	would	throw	 th 	 is 	 	material	out	.
and	so	we	 approach 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	patient	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	if	he	would	 collabor 	 ate 	 	with	us	.
could	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	precious	and	rare	 cancer 	 ous 	 	material	from	 th 	 is 	 	chest	tube	and	drive	it	 a 	 cross 	 	town	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	 mic 	 e 	 	and	try	to	do	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	and	stage	it	with	a	prototype	drug	?
well	that	would	be	 im 	 possible 	 	and	,	 right 	 ly 	 	,	 il 	 legal 	 	to	do	in	 human 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 oblig 	 ed 	 	us	.
at	the	lurie	family	center	for	animal	 im 	 aging 	 	,	my	 col 	 league 	 	,	andrew	 k 	 ung 	 	,	grew	 th 	 is 	 	cancer	 success 	 fully 	 	in	 mic 	 e 	 	 with 	 out 	 	ever	 touch 	 ing 	 	plastic	.
and	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	pet	 s 	 can 	 	of	a	mouse	--	what	we	call	a	pet	pet	.
the	cancer	is	growing	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	red	,	huge	mass	in	the	hind	limb	of	 th 	 is 	 	animal	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	treat	it	with	our	 com 	 pound 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 addict 	 ion 	 	to	sugar	,	 th 	 is 	 	rapid	growth	,	 fad 	 ed 	 	.
and	on	the	animal	on	the	right	,	you	see	that	the	cancer	was	 respond 	 ing 	 	.
we	've	 complete 	 d 	 	now	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	in	four	mouse	 model 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	disease	.
and	every	time	,	we	see	the	same	thing	.
the	 mic 	 e 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	cancer	that	get	the	drug	live	,	and	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	 rapid 	 ly 	 	perish	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	wonder	,	what	would	a	drug	company	do	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	?
well	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	keep	 th 	 is 	 	a	secret	 un 	 til 	 	they	turn	a	prototype	drug	 in 	 to 	 	an	active	pharmaceutical	 sub 	 stance 	 	.
and	so	we	did	just	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
we	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	paper	that	 de 	 scribed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	at	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	prototype	stage	.
we	 g 	 ave 	 	the	world	the	chemical	 ident 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	,	 typical 	 ly 	 	a	secret	in	our	discipline	.
we	told	people	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	to	make	it	.
we	 g 	 ave 	 	them	our	email	address	,	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	,	if	they	write	us	,	we	'll	 s 	 end 	 	them	a	free	molecule	.
we	 bas 	 ically 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	create	the	most	competitive	environment	for	our	lab	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 success 	 ful 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	now	when	we	've	 share 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	,	just	since	december	of	last	year	,	with	40	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	30	more	in	europe	--	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	pharmaceutical	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	seeking	now	to	enter	 th 	 is 	 	space	,	to	target	 th 	 is 	 	rare	cancer	that	,	 thank 	 fully 	 	right	now	,	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 desir 	 able 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	in	that	industry	.
but	the	science	that	's	coming	back	from	all	of	these	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	about	the	use	of	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	 ha 	 s 	 	 provide 	 d 	 	us	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	that	we	might	not	have	had	on	our	own	.
leukemia	 cell 	 s 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 com 	 pound 	 	turn	 in 	 to 	 	normal	white	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	.
 mic 	 e 	 	with	 multi 	 ple 	 	 myel 	 oma 	 	,	an	 incur 	 able 	 	 malign 	 ancy 	 	of	the	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	,	respond	 dramat 	 ically 	 	to	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	drug	.
you	might	know	that	fat	 ha 	 s 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	.
nice	to	be	able	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	that	for	you	.
and	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	 prevent 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	adipocyte	,	 th 	 is 	 	fat	stem	cell	,	from	 remember 	 ing 	 	how	to	make	fat	 s 	 uch 	 	that	 mic 	 e 	 	on	a	high	fat	diet	,	like	the	 folk 	 s 	 	in	my	 home 	 town 	 	of	chicago	,	fail	to	develop	fatty	liver	,	which	is	a	major	medical	problem	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	research	taught	us	--	not	just	my	lab	,	but	our	institute	,	and	harvard	medical	school	more	 general 	 ly 	 	--	is	that	we	have	 un 	 ique 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	in	academia	for	drug	 discover 	 y 	 	--	that	our	center	that	 ha 	 s 	 	tested	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	cancer	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	a	scientific	way	than	any	other	,	never	made	one	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	.
for	all	the	 reason 	 s 	 	you	see	 list 	 ed 	 	here	,	we	think	there	's	a	great	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	academic	 center 	 s 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ear 	 liest 	 	,	 conceptual 	 ly 	 	-	 trick 	 y 	 	and	creative	discipline	of	prototype	drug	 discover 	 y 	 	.
so	what	next	?
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	,	but	it	's	not	a	pill	yet	.
it	's	not	 or 	 ally 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
we	need	to	fix	it	,	so	that	we	can	deliver	it	to	our	 patient 	 s 	 	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	lab	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	these	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 feel 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 compel 	 led 	 	to	deliver	a	drug	 sub 	 stance 	 	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	.
it	's	here	where	i	have	to	say	that	we	could	use	your	help	and	your	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	,	your	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 particip 	 ation 	 	.
 un 	 like 	 	a	drug	company	,	we	do	n't	have	a	 pipe 	 line 	 	that	we	can	deposit	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	a	team	of	 sale 	 s 	 people 	 	and	 market 	 e 	 ers 	 	that	can	tell	us	how	to	position	 th 	 is 	 	drug	against	the	other	.
what	we	do	have	is	the	 flex 	 ibility 	 	of	an	academic	center	to	work	with	 compete 	 nt 	 	,	 motiv 	 ated 	 	,	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	well	-	funded	people	to	carry	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	forward	 in 	 to 	 	the	clinic	while	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	our	ability	to	share	the	prototype	drug	 world 	 wide 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	molecule	will	soon	 leav 	 e 	 	our	 bench 	 es 	 	and	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	small	 start 	 up 	 	company	 call 	 ed 	 	tensha	 therapeutic 	 s 	 	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	fourth	of	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	to	kind	of	graduate	from	our	little	 pipe 	 line 	 	of	drug	 discover 	 y 	 	,	two	of	which	--	a	 top 	 ical 	 	drug	for	 lymph 	 oma 	 	of	the	skin	,	an	 or 	 al 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 	for	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	of	 multi 	 ple 	 	 myel 	 oma 	 	--	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	to	the	 bed 	 side 	 	for	first	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	in	july	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
for	us	,	a	major	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	 mile 	 stone 	 	.
i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	just	two	 idea 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	if	 any 	 thing 	 	is	 un 	 ique 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	research	,	it	's	less	the	science	than	the	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	--	that	 th 	 is 	 	for	us	was	a	social	experiment	,	an	experiment	in	what	would	happen	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 s 	 	open	and	honest	at	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	phase	of	 discover 	 y 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	research	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	be	.
 th 	 is 	 	string	of	 letter 	 s 	 	and	 number 	 s 	 	and	 symbol 	 s 	 	and	parentheses	that	can	be	 text 	 ed 	 	,	i	suppose	,	or	twittered	 world 	 wide 	 	,	is	the	chemical	 ident 	 ity 	 	of	our	pro	 com 	 pound 	 	.
it	's	the	information	that	we	most	need	from	pharmaceutical	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	the	information	on	how	these	early	prototype	 drug 	 s 	 	might	work	.
yet	 th 	 is 	 	information	is	 large 	 ly 	 	a	secret	.
and	so	we	seek	 re 	 ally 	 	to	download	from	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 success 	 es 	 	of	the	computer	science	industry	two	 principle 	 s 	 	:	that	of	opensource	and	that	of	 crowd 	 sourcing 	 	to	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 respons 	 ibly 	 	 accele 	 rate 	 	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	 target 	 ed 	 	 therapeutic 	 s 	 	to	 patient 	 s 	 	with	cancer	.
now	the	business	model	 involve 	 s 	 	all	of	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	research	is	funded	by	the	public	.
it	's	funded	by	 found 	 ations 	 	.
and	one	thing	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	boston	is	that	you	people	will	do	 any 	 thing 	 	for	cancer	--	and	i	love	that	.
you	bike	 a 	 cross 	 	the	state	.	you	walk	up	and	down	the	river	.
i	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 any 	 where 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	support	for	cancer	research	.
and	so	i	want	to	thank	you	for	your	 particip 	 ation 	 	,	your	 collabor 	 ation 	 	and	most	of	all	for	your	confidence	in	our	 idea 	 s 	 	.
