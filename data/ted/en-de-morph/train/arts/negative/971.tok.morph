so	,	i	'd	like	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	with	you	 folk 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 imagin 	 ing 	 	what	our	planet	might	look	like	in	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	before	i	do	that	,	i	need	to	talk	to	you	about	synthetic	 material 	 s 	 	like	 plastic 	 s 	 	,	which	 requir 	 e 	 	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	energy	to	create	and	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 dispos 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	are	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	our	planet	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	tell	you	and	share	with	you	how	my	team	and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	using	 mushroom 	 s 	 	over	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
not	like	that	.
we	're	using	 mushroom 	 s 	 	to	create	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	class	of	 material 	 s 	 	,	which	perform	a	lot	like	 plastic 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	use	,	but	are	made	from	crop	waste	and	are	 total 	 ly 	 	 com 	 post 	 able 	 	at	the	end	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
i	need	to	talk	to	you	about	what	i	consider	one	of	the	most	 egreg 	 ious 	 	 offend 	 ers 	 	in	the	 dispos 	 able 	 	 plastic 	 s 	 	 categor 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	material	you	all	know	is	styrofoam	,	but	i	like	to	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	toxic	white	stuff	.
in	a	single	cubic	foot	of	 th 	 is 	 	material	--	about	what	would	come	around	your	computer	or	large	 tele 	 vision 	 	--	you	have	the	same	energy	content	of	about	a	liter	and	a	half	of	 petro 	 l 	 	.
yet	,	after	just	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	of	use	,	you	'll	throw	 th 	 is 	 	material	in	the	trash	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	just	found	in	 pack 	 aging 	 	.
20	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	material	is	 produce 	 d 	 	every	year	,	in	 every 	 thing 	 	from	building	 material 	 s 	 	to	 surf 	 board 	 s 	 	to	coffee	 cup 	 s 	 	to	table	 top 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	it	's	found	.
the	epa	 estimate 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	by	volume	,	 th 	 is 	 	material	 occu 	 pies 	 	25	percent	of	our	 land 	 fill 	 s 	 	.
even	 wo 	 rse 	 	is	when	it	 find 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	way	 in 	 to 	 	our	natural	environment	--	on	the	side	of	the	road	or	next	to	a	river	.
if	it	's	not	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	by	a	human	,	like	me	and	you	,	it	'll	stay	there	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	is	when	it	 find 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	way	 in 	 to 	 	our	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	like	in	the	great	plastic	 gy 	 re 	 	,	where	these	 material 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	broken	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 er 	 	and	 small 	 er 	 	bits	,	but	they	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	going	away	.
they	're	not	 bio 	 logically 	 	compatible	.
they	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 foul 	 ing 	 	up	earth	's	 respirator 	 y 	 	and	 circul 	 atory 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 material 	 s 	 	are	so	 pro 	 l 	 ific 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	found	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	there	's	one	other	place	you	'll	find	 th 	 is 	 	material	,	styrene	,	which	is	made	from	 be 	 n 	 zen 	 e 	 	,	a	known	carcinogen	.
you	'll	find	it	 in 	 side 	 	of	you	.
so	,	for	all	these	 reason 	 s 	 	,	i	think	we	need	better	 material 	 s 	 	,	and	there	are	three	key	 principle 	 s 	 	we	can	use	to	guide	these	 material 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	 feed 	 stock 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	we	use	a	single	 feed 	 stock 	 	,	petroleum	,	to	heat	our	 home 	 s 	 	,	power	our	 car 	 s 	 	and	make	most	of	the	 material 	 s 	 	you	see	around	you	.
we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	resource	,	and	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	crazy	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	put	a	liter	and	a	half	of	 petro 	 l 	 	in	the	trash	every	time	you	get	a	package	.
second	of	all	,	we	should	 re 	 ally 	 	 striv 	 e 	 	to	use	far	less	energy	in	creating	these	 material 	 s 	 	.
i	say	far	less	,	 be 	 cause 	 	10	percent	is	n't	going	to	cut	it	.
we	should	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	half	,	a	quarter	,	one	-	tenth	the	energy	content	.
and	 last 	 ly 	 	,	and	i	think	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	we	should	be	creating	 material 	 s 	 	that	fit	 in 	 to 	 	what	i	call	nature	's	 recycl 	 ing 	 	system	.
 th 	 is 	 	 recycl 	 ing 	 	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	place	for	the	last	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	fit	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	you	fit	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	and	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	 top 	 s 	 	,	my	body	can	return	to	the	earth	with	no	 pre 	 process 	 ing 	 	.
yet	that	 pack 	 aging 	 	i	got	in	the	mail	 yester 	 day 	 	is	going	to	last	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	crazy	.
but	nature	 provide 	 s 	 	us	with	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	model	here	.
when	a	tree	's	 d 	 one 	 	using	 it 	 s 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	--	 it 	 s 	 	solar	 collect 	 ors 	 	,	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 photo 	 n 	 	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	--	at	the	end	of	a	season	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	pack	them	up	,	take	them	to	the	leaf	 re 	 process 	 ing 	 	center	and	have	them	 melt 	 ed 	 	down	to	form	new	 leav 	 es 	 	.
it	just	 drop 	 s 	 	them	,	the	 short 	 est 	 	distance	possible	,	to	the	forest	floor	,	where	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 up 	 cycle 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	next	year	's	 top 	 s 	 oil 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 get 	 s 	 	us	back	to	the	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	nature	,	 mushroom 	 s 	 	are	the	 recycl 	 ing 	 	system	.
and	what	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	,	by	using	a	part	of	the	mushroom	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	never	 s 	 een 	 	--	 analog 	 ous 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	root	structure	;	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 mycel 	 ium 	 	--	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	grow	 material 	 s 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	same	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	 convention 	 al 	 	 synthetic 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	material	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	self	-	 assem 	 bling 	 	material	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	would	consider	waste	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	seed	 husk 	 s 	 	or	 wood 	 y 	 	 bio 	 mass 	 	--	and	can	transform	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	 chi 	 tin 	 ous 	 	polymer	,	which	you	can	form	 in 	 to 	 	 al 	 most 	 	any	shape	.
in	our	process	,	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	glue	.
and	by	using	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	glue	,	you	can	mold	 thing 	 s 	 	just	like	you	do	in	the	plastic	industry	,	and	you	can	create	 material 	 s 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	different	 proper 	 ties 	 	,	 material 	 s 	 	that	are	 insula 	 ting 	 	,	fire	-	resistant	,	 moist 	 ure 	 	-	resistant	,	vapor	-	resistant	--	 material 	 s 	 	that	can	absorb	 impact 	 s 	 	,	that	can	absorb	 acoustic 	 al 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	.
but	these	 material 	 s 	 	are	grown	from	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 by 	 product 	 s 	 	,	not	petroleum	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	made	of	natural	 material 	 s 	 	,	they	are	100	percent	 com 	 post 	 able 	 	in	you	own	 back 	 yard 	 	.
so	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	the	four	 bas 	 ic 	 	 step 	 s 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	make	these	 material 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	 select 	 ing 	 	a	 feed 	 stock 	 	,	 prefer 	 ably 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 region 	 al 	 	,	that	's	in	your	area	,	right	--	local	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
the	next	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	taking	 th 	 is 	 	 feed 	 stock 	 	and	 put 	 ting 	 	in	a	tool	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	 fill 	 ing 	 	an	 en 	 closure 	 	,	a	mold	,	in	 what 	 ever 	 	shape	you	want	to	get	.
then	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	grow	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	through	these	 particle 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	where	the	magic	 happen 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	organism	is	 do 	 ing 	 	the	work	in	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	not	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
the	final	step	is	,	of	course	,	the	product	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	 pack 	 aging 	 	material	,	a	table	top	,	or	building	block	.
our	vision	is	local	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	,	like	the	local	food	 move 	 ment 	 	,	for	production	.
so	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	 formula 	 tions 	 	for	all	around	the	world	using	 region 	 al 	 	 by 	 product 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	you	might	use	a	rice	husk	or	a	 cotton 	 seed 	 	hull	.
if	you	're	in	 north 	 ern 	 	europe	or	north	america	,	you	can	use	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 buck 	 wheat 	 	 husk 	 s 	 	or	oat	 hull 	 s 	 	.
we	then	process	these	 husk 	 s 	 	with	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
and	i	want	to	share	with	you	a	quick	video	from	our	 facil 	 ity 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	sense	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	at	scale	.
so	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	cotton	 hull 	 s 	 	from	texas	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	.
it	's	a	waste	product	.
and	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	our	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	is	going	through	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	system	,	which	 clean 	 s 	 	,	 cook 	 s 	 	,	 cool 	 s 	 	and	 paste 	 ur 	 ize 	 s 	 	these	 material 	 s 	 	,	while	 al 	 so 	 	 continu 	 ously 	 	 inocul 	 ating 	 	them	with	our	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	stream	of	material	that	we	can	put	 in 	 to 	 	 al 	 most 	 	any	shape	,	 th 	 ough 	 	 to 	 day 	 	we	're	making	corner	 block 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	when	 th 	 is 	 	 li 	 d 	 	 go 	 es 	 	on	the	part	,	that	the	magic	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	process	is	our	organism	.
it	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	begin	to	digest	these	 waste 	 s 	 	and	,	over	the	next	five	 day 	 s 	 	,	assemble	them	 in 	 to 	 	 bio 	 composite 	 s 	 	.
our	entire	 facil 	 ity 	 	is	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	 tool 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	in	the	dark	,	 quiet 	 ly 	 	self	-	 assem 	 bling 	 	 material 	 s 	 	--	and	 every 	 thing 	 	from	building	 material 	 s 	 	to	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	 pack 	 aging 	 	corner	block	.
so	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	a	number	of	 time 	 s 	 	that	we	grow	 material 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	kind	of	hard	to	picture	how	that	 happen 	 s 	 	.
so	my	team	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	five	 day 	 s 	 	-	worth	of	growth	,	a	typical	growth	cycle	for	us	,	and	 condens 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	15	-	second	time	lapse	.
and	i	want	you	to	 re 	 ally 	 	watch	 close 	 ly 	 	these	little	white	 dot 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	over	the	five	-	day	period	,	what	they	do	is	extend	out	and	through	 th 	 is 	 	material	,	using	the	energy	that	's	 contain 	 ed 	 	in	these	seed	 husk 	 s 	 	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	 chi 	 tin 	 ous 	 	polymer	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	self	-	assembles	,	growing	through	and	around	the	 particle 	 s 	 	,	making	 million 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	 fiber 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	seed	husk	we	do	n't	digest	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	final	,	physical	composite	.
so	in	front	of	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	part	just	self	-	 assemble 	 d 	 	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	a	little	 long 	 er 	 	.	it	 take 	 s 	 	five	 day 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	much	 fast 	 er 	 	than	 convention 	 al 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	.
the	last	step	,	of	course	,	is	application	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	've	grown	a	corner	block	.
a	major	fortune	500	furniture	maker	uses	these	corner	 block 	 s 	 	to	protect	 the 	 ir 	 	 table 	 s 	 	in	 ship 	 ment 	 	.
they	used	to	use	a	plastic	 pack 	 aging 	 	 buff 	 er 	 	,	but	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	give	them	the	exact	same	physical	performance	with	our	grown	material	.
best	of	all	,	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	the	 custom 	 er 	 	,	it	's	not	trash	.
they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	 th 	 is 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	 eco 	 system 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	 process 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	's	going	to	improve	the	local	 s 	 oil 	 	.
so	,	why	 mycel 	 ium 	 	?
the	first	reason	is	local	open	 feed 	 stock 	 s 	 	.
you	want	to	be	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	and	not	worry	about	peak	rice	hull	or	peak	 cotton 	 seed 	 	 hull 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	 multi 	 ple 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	.
the	next	is	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	organism	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	most	of	the	work	in	 th 	 is 	 	process	.
you	do	n't	need	a	lot	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	to	set	up	a	production	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
so	you	can	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	small	 facil 	 ities 	 	spread	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
 bio 	 logical 	 	yield	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	100	percent	of	what	we	put	in	the	tool	 be 	 come 	 	the	final	product	,	even	the	 part 	 s 	 	that	are	n't	 digest 	 ed 	 	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	structure	,	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	yield	rates	.
natural	 polymer 	 s 	 	,	well	...	i	think	that	's	what	's	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 polymer 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	tested	in	our	 eco 	 system 	 	for	the	last	billion	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	 every 	 thing 	 	from	 mushroom 	 s 	 	to	 crustacean 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	going	to	clog	up	earth	's	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.	they	work	great	.
and	while	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	can	 practical 	 ly 	 	guarantee	that	 yester 	 day 	 	's	 pack 	 aging 	 	is	going	to	be	here	in	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	what	i	want	to	guarantee	is	that	in	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	our	 descend 	 ants 	 	,	our	children	's	children	,	will	be	living	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	and	in	 harmon 	 y 	 	with	a	 health 	 y 	 	earth	.
and	i	think	that	can	be	some	 re 	 ally 	 	good	news	.
thank	you	.
