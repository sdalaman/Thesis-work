my	name	is	joseph	,	a	member	of	parliament	in	kenya	.
picture	a	maasai	village	,	and	one	 even 	 ing 	 	,	government	 soldier 	 s 	 	come	,	surround	the	village	and	ask	each	elder	to	 br 	 ing 	 	one	boy	to	school	.
that	's	how	i	went	to	school	--	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	a	government	guy	 point 	 ing 	 	a	gun	and	told	my	father	,	``	you	have	to	make	a	choice	.	``
so	,	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 ably 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 mission 	 ary 	 	school	that	was	run	by	an	american	 mission 	 ary 	 	,	and	the	first	thing	the	american	 mission 	 ary 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	was	a	 can 	 dy 	 	.
i	had	never	in	my	life	ever	 taste 	 d 	 	 can 	 dy 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	with	all	these	hundred	other	 boy 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	belong	.
 stay 	 ed 	 	when	 every 	 body 	 	else	was	dropping	out	.
my	family	 move 	 d 	 	;	we	're	 nomad 	 s 	 	.
every	time	school	closed	--	it	was	a	 board 	 ing 	 	school	and	i	was	seven	--	you	had	to	travel	 un 	 til 	 	you	find	them	.
fifty	 mile 	 s 	 	,	40	 mile 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.
you	slept	in	the	bush	,	but	you	 ke 	 pt 	 	going	.
and	i	 stay 	 ed 	 	.	i	do	n't	know	why	i	 stay 	 ed 	 	,	but	i	 stay 	 ed 	 	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	i	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	national	examination	,	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	high	school	in	kenya	.
and	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	high	school	.	and	just	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	i	found	a	man	who	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	full	 scholar 	 ship 	 	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
my	mother	still	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	cow	-	dung	hut	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	my	 brother 	 s 	 	are	going	to	school	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	man	told	me	,	``	here	,	go	.	``
so	i	got	a	 scholar 	 ship 	 	to	st.	lawrence	university	,	 up 	 state 	 	new	york	;	 finish 	 ed 	 	that	.	and	then	after	that	i	went	to	harvard	graduate	school	;	 finish 	 ed 	 	that	.	and	then	i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	dc	a	little	bit	:	i	wrote	a	book	for	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	and	taught	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	u.s.	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	every	time	,	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	going	back	home	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	these	people	--	sick	people	,	people	with	no	water	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	--	and	every	time	i	go	back	to	america	,	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	them	.
then	one	day	,	an	elder	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	story	and	 th 	 is 	 	story	went	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	long	time	ago	,	there	was	a	big	war	between	 tribe 	 s 	 	.
and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	specific	tribe	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	other	luhya	tribe	.
and	every	time	,	they	 s 	 ent 	 	 scout 	 s 	 	out	there	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	no	one	 attack 	 ed 	 	them	.
so	one	day	,	the	 scout 	 s 	 	came	running	and	told	the	 village 	 rs 	 	,	``	the	 ene 	 mies 	 	are	coming	.	 on 	 ly 	 	half	an	hour	away	,	they	'll	be	here	.	``
so	people	 scramble 	 d 	 	,	took	 the 	 ir 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	ready	to	go	,	move	out	.
but	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	men	:	one	man	was	blind	,	one	man	had	no	 leg 	 s 	 	--	he	was	born	like	that	.
the	 lead 	 er 	 	of	the	 chief 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	sorry	.	we	ca	n't	take	you	.	you	'll	 s 	 low 	 	us	down	.
we	have	to	flee	our	women	and	children	,	we	have	to	run	.	``
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	left	 be 	 hind 	 	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	die	.
but	these	two	people	 work 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	out	.
the	blind	man	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	i	'm	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	man	but	i	ca	n't	see	.	``
the	man	with	no	 leg 	 s 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	can	see	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	the	end	of	the	world	,	but	i	ca	n't	 s 	 ave 	 	 my 	 self 	 	from	a	cat	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.	``
so	the	blind	man	went	down	on	his	 knee 	 s 	 	,	down	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	told	the	man	with	no	 leg 	 s 	 	to	go	over	his	back	,	and	stood	up	.
the	man	on	top	can	see	,	the	blind	man	can	walk	.
and	these	 guy 	 s 	 	took	off	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	the	 foot 	 step 	 s 	 	of	the	 village 	 rs 	 	 un 	 til 	 	they	found	and	 pass 	 ed 	 	them	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	told	to	me	in	a	 set 	 up 	 	of	 elder 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	poor	area	.	i	represent	 north 	 ern 	 	kenya	:	the	most	 nomad 	 ic 	 	,	remote	 area 	 s 	 	you	can	even	find	.
and	that	man	told	me	,	``	so	,	here	you	are	.
you	've	got	a	good	education	from	america	,	you	have	a	good	life	in	america	;	what	are	you	going	to	do	for	us	?
we	want	you	to	be	our	 eye 	 s 	 	,	we	'll	give	you	the	 leg 	 s 	 	.
we	'll	walk	you	,	you	lead	us	.	``
so	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	came	,	and	i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	:	``	what	can	i	do	to	help	my	people	?
every	time	you	go	to	an	area	where	for	43	 year 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	we	still	do	n't	have	 bas 	 ic 	 	health	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
a	man	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 transport 	 ed 	 	in	a	wheelbarrow	20	,	30	 kilometer 	 s 	 	for	a	hospital	.	no	clean	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	dedicate	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	'm	 leav 	 ing 	 	america	.	i	'm	going	to	run	for	 off 	 ice 	 	.	``
so	last	july	...	i	 move 	 d 	 	from	america	in	june	,	ran	in	july	election	and	won	.
and	i	came	for	them	,	and	that	's	my	goal	.
and	right	now	i	have	in	place	,	for	the	last	nine	 month 	 s 	 	,	a	plan	that	in	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	every	nomad	will	have	clean	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
we	're	building	 dispens 	 aries 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	that	 constit 	 uency 	 	.
i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	my	 friend 	 s 	 	from	america	to	help	with	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 nurse 	 s 	 	or	 doctor 	 s 	 	to	help	us	out	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	improve	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
i	'm	using	the	knowledge	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	from	my	community	to	move	them	forward	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	develop	 home 	 grown 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	to	our	 issue 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 real 	 ize 	 	that	people	from	 out 	 side 	 	can	come	and	help	us	,	but	if	we	do	n't	help	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	we	can	do	.
so	my	plan	right	now	 a 	 s 	 	i	 continu 	 e 	 	with	 introduc 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	to	different	 field 	 s 	 	--	some	 be 	 come 	 	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	some	 lawyer 	 s 	 	--	we	want	to	produce	a	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	group	of	people	,	 student 	 s 	 	,	who	can	come	back	and	help	us	see	a	community	grow	that	is	in	the	middle	of	a	huge	economic	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	 continu 	 e 	 	to	be	a	member	of	parliament	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 continu 	 e 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	all	of	you	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 bot 	 any 	 	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	health	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	new	 invent 	 ions 	 	,	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	one	day	in	my	own	little	community	--	which	is	26,000	square	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	five	 time 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	rhode	 is 	 land 	 	--	with	no	 road 	 s 	 	,	we	'll	be	able	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	model	to	help	 other 	 s 	 	develop	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
