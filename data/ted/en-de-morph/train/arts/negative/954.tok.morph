if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	understand	the	problem	that	we	're	facing	with	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	think	about	the	biology	at	the	same	time	you	think	about	the	physics	.
we	ca	n't	solve	the	 problem 	 s 	 	 un 	 less 	 	we	start	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	ocean	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	much	more	 inter 	 disciplinary 	 	way	.
so	i	'm	going	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	that	through	 discuss 	 ion 	 	of	some	of	the	climate	change	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	on	in	the	ocean	.
we	'll	look	at	sea	level	rise	.
we	'll	look	at	ocean	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	the	last	thing	on	the	list	there	,	ocean	 acid 	 ification 	 	--	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	ask	me	,	you	know	,	``	what	do	you	worry	about	the	most	?
what	 frighten 	 s 	 	you	?	``
for	me	,	it	's	ocean	 acid 	 ification 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	onto	the	stage	 pre 	 tty 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
so	i	will	 s 	 pend 	 	a	little	time	at	the	end	.
i	was	in	copenhagen	in	december	like	a	number	of	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
and	i	think	we	all	found	it	,	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	an	eye	-	 open 	 ing 	 	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	experience	.
i	 s 	 at 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	large	 negoti 	 ation 	 	hall	,	at	one	point	,	for	three	or	four	 hour 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	the	word	``	 ocean 	 s 	 	``	one	time	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	on	the	radar	screen	.
the	 nation 	 s 	 	that	 br 	 ought 	 	it	up	when	we	had	the	 speech 	 es 	 	of	the	national	 lead 	 ers 	 	--	it	 tend 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	the	small	 is 	 land 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	the	low	-	 ly 	 ing 	 	 is 	 land 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	by	 th 	 is 	 	weird	quirk	of	 alpha 	 bet 	 ical 	 	order	of	the	 nation 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	the	low	-	 ly 	 ing 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	like	kiribati	and	nauru	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 seat 	 ed 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	of	these	 immense 	 ly 	 	long	 row 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 marginal 	 ized 	 	in	the	 negoti 	 ation 	 	room	.
one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	is	coming	up	with	the	right	target	.
it	's	not	clear	what	the	target	should	be	.
and	how	can	you	figure	out	how	to	fix	 some 	 thing 	 	if	you	do	n't	have	a	clear	target	?
now	,	you	've	heard	about	``	two	 degree 	 s 	 	``	:	that	we	should	limit	temperature	rise	to	no	more	than	two	 degree 	 s 	 	.
but	there	's	not	a	lot	of	science	 be 	 hind 	 	that	number	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	of	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	the	atmosphere	.
should	it	be	450	?	should	it	be	400	?
there	's	not	a	lot	of	science	 be 	 hind 	 	that	one	either	.
most	of	the	science	that	is	 be 	 hind 	 	these	 number 	 s 	 	,	these	potential	 target 	 s 	 	,	is	based	on	 stud 	 ies 	 	on	land	.
and	i	would	say	,	for	the	people	that	work	in	the	ocean	and	think	about	what	the	 target 	 s 	 	should	be	,	we	would	 argu 	 e 	 	that	they	must	be	much	lower	.
you	know	,	from	an	 ocean 	 ic 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	450	is	way	too	high	.
now	there	's	 compel 	 ling 	 	evidence	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	350	.
we	are	,	right	now	,	at	390	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	of	co	2	in	the	atmosphere	.
we	're	not	going	to	put	the	 brake 	 s 	 	on	in	time	to	stop	at	450	,	so	we	've	got	to	accept	we	're	going	to	do	an	 over 	 shoot 	 	,	and	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	forward	 ha 	 s 	 	to	focus	on	how	far	the	 over 	 shoot 	 	 go 	 es 	 	and	what	's	the	 path 	 way 	 	back	to	350	.
now	,	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	so	 complic 	 ated 	 	?
why	do	n't	we	know	some	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	better	?
well	,	the	problem	is	that	we	've	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 force 	 s 	 	in	the	climate	system	.
there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	natural	 cause 	 s 	 	of	climate	change	.
there	's	air	-	sea	 interact 	 ions 	 	.
here	in	galapagos	,	we	're	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	el	ninos	and	la	nina	.
but	the	entire	planet	 warm 	 s 	 	up	when	there	's	a	big	el	nino	.
 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	eject	 aero 	 s 	 ol 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	.
that	 change 	 s 	 	our	climate	.
the	ocean	 contain 	 s 	 	most	of	the	 ex 	 change 	 able 	 	heat	on	the	planet	.
so	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 influence 	 s 	 	how	ocean	surface	 water 	 s 	 	mix	with	the	deep	water	 change 	 s 	 	the	ocean	of	the	planet	.
and	we	know	the	solar	 out 	 put 	 	's	not	constant	through	time	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	natural	 cause 	 s 	 	of	climate	change	.
and	then	we	have	the	human	-	induced	 cause 	 s 	 	of	climate	change	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
we	're	changing	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	the	surface	of	the	land	,	the	 reflect 	 ivity 	 	.
we	inject	our	own	 aero 	 s 	 ol 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	,	and	we	have	trace	 gas 	 es 	 	,	and	not	just	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	--	it	's	 m 	 ethane 	 	,	 o 	 zone 	 	,	 oxide 	 s 	 	of	sulfur	and	nitrogen	.
so	here	's	the	thing	.	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	simple	question	.
is	co	2	 produce 	 d 	 	by	man	's	 activ 	 ities 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	planet	to	warm	up	?
but	to	answer	that	question	,	to	make	a	clear	 attribut 	 ion 	 	to	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	you	have	to	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	all	of	these	other	 agent 	 s 	 	of	change	.
but	the	fact	is	we	do	know	a	lot	about	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 understand 	 ing 	 	all	of	these	man	-	made	 cause 	 s 	 	and	the	natural	 cause 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	got	it	 work 	 ed 	 	out	,	and	we	can	say	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	co	2	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	planet	to	warm	up	now	.	``
now	,	we	have	 man 	 y 	 	ways	to	 stud 	 y 	 	natural	 vari 	 ability 	 	.
i	'll	show	you	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	ship	that	i	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	three	 month 	 s 	 	on	in	the	antarctic	.
it	's	a	scientific	 drill 	 ing 	 	vessel	.
we	go	out	for	 month 	 s 	 	at	a	time	and	drill	 in 	 to 	 	the	sea	bed	to	 re 	 cover 	 	 sediment 	 s 	 	that	tell	us	 st 	 ories 	 	of	climate	change	,	right	.
like	one	of	the	ways	to	understand	our	 green 	 house 	 	future	is	to	drill	down	in	time	to	the	last	period	where	we	had	co	2	double	what	it	is	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	so	that	's	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	ship	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	south	of	the	antarctic	circle	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	 down 	 right 	 	 tropic 	 al 	 	there	.
one	day	where	we	had	calm	 sea 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 un 	 	,	which	was	the	reason	i	could	get	off	the	ship	.
most	of	the	time	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	had	a	 wave 	 s 	 	up	to	50	ft	.
and	 wind 	 s 	 	 ave 	 rag 	 ing 	 	about	40	 knot 	 s 	 	for	most	of	the	voyage	and	up	to	70	or	80	 knot 	 s 	 	.
so	that	trip	just	 end 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	ca	n't	show	you	too	 man 	 y 	 	 result 	 s 	 	from	that	right	now	,	but	we	'll	go	back	one	more	year	,	to	 an 	 other 	 	 drill 	 ing 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	led	by	ross	powell	and	tim	naish	.
it	's	the	andrill	project	.
and	we	made	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	bore	hole	through	the	largest	 float 	 ing 	 	ice	shelf	on	the	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	crazy	thing	,	 th 	 is 	 	big	drill	rig	 wrap 	 ped 	 	in	a	 blank 	 et 	 	to	keep	 every 	 body 	 	warm	,	 drill 	 ing 	 	at	 temperature 	 s 	 	of	minus	40	.
and	we	 drill 	 ed 	 	in	the	ross	sea	.
that	's	the	ross	sea	ice	shelf	on	the	right	there	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	huge	 float 	 ing 	 	ice	shelf	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	alaska	 come 	 s 	 	from	west	antarctica	.
now	,	west	antarctica	is	the	part	of	the	continent	where	the	ice	is	 ground 	 ed 	 	on	sea	floor	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	2,000	 meter 	 s 	 	deep	.
so	that	ice	sheet	is	 part 	 ly 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	's	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	the	ocean	,	to	the	ocean	heat	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	part	of	antarctica	that	we	worry	about	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 part 	 ly 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	imagine	,	is	sea	level	 rise 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	,	the	ice	 lift 	 s 	 	off	the	bed	,	and	then	it	can	break	off	and	float	north	.
when	that	ice	 melt 	 s 	 	,	sea	level	 rise 	 s 	 	by	six	 meter 	 s 	 	.
so	we	drill	back	in	time	to	see	how	often	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	and	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	fast	that	ice	can	melt	.
here	's	the	cartoon	on	the	left	there	.
we	 drill 	 ed 	 	through	a	hundred	 meter 	 s 	 	of	 float 	 ing 	 	ice	shelf	then	through	900	 meter 	 s 	 	of	water	and	then	1,300	 meter 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sea	floor	.
so	it	's	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 geo 	 logical 	 	bore	hole	ever	 drill 	 ed 	 	.
it	took	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	project	together	.
and	here	's	what	we	found	.
now	,	there	's	40	 scientist 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	and	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	and	expensive	analyses	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	you	know	,	the	thing	that	told	the	best	story	was	 th 	 is 	 	simple	visual	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	.
you	know	,	we	saw	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	core	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	came	up	.
we	saw	these	 alter 	 nation 	 s 	 	between	 sediment 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	there	's	 grave 	 l 	 	and	 cobble 	 s 	 	in	there	and	a	bunch	of	sand	.
that	's	the	kind	of	material	in	the	deep	sea	.
it	can	 on 	 ly 	 	get	there	if	it	's	carried	out	by	ice	.
so	we	know	there	's	an	ice	shelf	 over 	 head 	 	.
and	that	 alternate 	 s 	 	with	a	sediment	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	sediment	is	100	percent	made	up	of	the	 shell 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 plant 	 s 	 	need	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	so	we	know	when	we	find	that	sediment	there	's	no	ice	 over 	 head 	 	.
and	we	saw	about	35	 alter 	 nation 	 s 	 	between	open	water	and	ice	-	 cover 	 ed 	 	water	,	between	 grave 	 l 	 s 	 	and	these	plant	 sediment 	 s 	 	.
so	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	,	what	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	is	that	the	ross	sea	region	,	 th 	 is 	 	ice	shelf	,	 melt 	 ed 	 	back	and	 form 	 ed 	 	 a 	 new 	 	about	35	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	past	four	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	 imagin 	 ed 	 	that	the	west	antarctic	ice	sheet	was	 th 	 is 	 	dynamic	.
in	fact	,	the	lore	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	``	the	ice	 form 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	there	ever	since	.	``
and	now	we	know	that	in	our	 re 	 cent 	 	past	it	 melt 	 ed 	 	back	and	 form 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	sea	level	went	up	and	down	,	six	 meter 	 s 	 	at	a	time	.
what	 caus 	 ed 	 	it	?
well	,	we	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	amount	of	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 reach 	 ing 	 	antarctica	,	just	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	natural	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	orbit	of	the	earth	.
but	here	's	the	key	thing	:	you	know	,	the	other	thing	we	found	out	is	that	the	ice	sheet	 pass 	 ed 	 	a	threshold	,	that	the	planet	 warm 	 ed 	 	up	 en 	 ough 	 	--	and	the	number	's	about	one	degree	to	one	and	a	half	 degree 	 s 	 	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	--	the	planet	 warm 	 ed 	 	up	 en 	 ough 	 	that	it	 be 	 came 	 	...
that	ice	sheet	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	dynamic	and	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	 melt 	 ed 	 	.
and	you	know	what	?
we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	temperature	in	the	last	century	just	the	right	amount	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	are	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	now	that	west	antarctica	,	the	west	antarctic	ice	sheet	,	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	melt	.
we	do	expect	to	see	a	sea	-	level	rise	on	the	order	of	one	to	two	 meter 	 s 	 	by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
and	it	could	be	 large 	 r 	 	than	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	serious	 con 	 sequence 	 	for	 nation 	 s 	 	like	kiribati	,	you	know	,	where	the	average	 elev 	 ation 	 	is	about	a	little	over	a	meter	above	sea	level	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	the	second	story	 take 	 s 	 	place	here	in	galapagos	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 bleach 	 ed 	 	coral	,	coral	that	 di 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	1982	-	'83	el	nino	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	champion	 is 	 land 	 	.
it	's	about	a	meter	tall	pavona	clavus	 colon 	 y 	 	.
and	it	's	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	.	that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
when	these	 thing 	 s 	 	die	,	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	 organism 	 s 	 	come	in	and	 en 	 crust 	 	and	live	on	that	dead	surface	.
and	so	,	when	a	coral	 colon 	 y 	 	is	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	an	el	nino	event	,	it	 leav 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 del 	 ible 	 	record	.
you	can	go	then	and	 stud 	 y 	 	 coral 	 s 	 	and	figure	out	how	often	do	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	thought	of	in	the	'80s	was	to	go	back	and	take	 core 	 s 	 	of	coral	 head 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	galapagos	and	find	out	how	often	was	there	a	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	event	.
and	just	so	you	know	,	1982	-	'83	,	that	el	nino	 kill 	 ed 	 	95	percent	of	all	the	 coral 	 s 	 	here	in	galapagos	.
then	there	was	similar	 mortal 	 ity 	 	in	'97	-	'98	.
and	what	we	found	after	 drill 	 ing 	 	back	in	time	two	to	400	 year 	 s 	 	was	that	these	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	 event 	 s 	 	.
we	saw	no	other	mass	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 event 	 s 	 	.
so	these	 event 	 s 	 	in	our	 re 	 cent 	 	past	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 un 	 ique 	 	.
so	they	're	either	just	 tru 	 ly 	 	 mon 	 ster 	 	el	ninos	,	or	they	're	just	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	el	ninos	that	 occur 	 red 	 	against	a	 back 	 drop 	 	of	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
either	case	,	it	's	bad	news	for	the	 coral 	 s 	 	of	the	galapagos	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
here	's	how	we	 s 	 ample 	 	the	 coral 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	easter	 is 	 land 	 	.	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 mon 	 ster 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	coral	is	eight	 meter 	 s 	 	tall	,	right	.
and	it	 be 	 en 	 	growing	for	about	600	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	,	sylvia	earle	 turn 	 ed 	 	me	on	to	 th 	 is 	 	exact	same	coral	.
and	she	was	 div 	 ing 	 	here	with	john	lauret	--	i	think	it	was	1994	--	and	 collect 	 ed 	 	a	little	nugget	and	 s 	 ent 	 	it	to	me	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	,	and	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	we	could	tell	the	temperature	of	the	ancient	ocean	from	 analyz 	 ing 	 	a	coral	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	we	have	a	diamond	drill	.
we	're	not	 kill 	 ing 	 	the	 colon 	 y 	 	;	we	're	taking	a	small	core	 s 	 ample 	 	out	of	the	top	.
the	core	 come 	 s 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	these	 cylindr 	 ical 	 	 tube 	 s 	 	of	 lime 	 stone 	 	.
and	that	material	then	we	take	back	to	the	lab	and	 analyz 	 e 	 	it	.
you	can	see	some	of	the	coral	 core 	 s 	 	there	on	the	right	.
so	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	all	over	the	eastern	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	do	it	in	the	western	 pac 	 ific 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	'll	take	you	back	here	to	the	galapagos	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 up 	 lift 	 	here	in	urbina	 ba 	 y 	 	.
that	the	place	where	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	an	 earth 	 quake 	 	in	1954	,	 th 	 is 	 	marine	 ter 	 race 	 	was	 lift 	 ed 	 	up	out	of	the	ocean	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	it	was	 lift 	 ed 	 	up	about	six	to	seven	 meter 	 s 	 	.
and	so	now	you	can	walk	through	a	coral	reef	 with 	 out 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	wet	.
if	you	go	on	the	ground	there	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 grand 	 addy 	 	coral	.
it	's	11	 meter 	 s 	 	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	,	and	we	know	that	it	 start 	 ed 	 	growing	in	the	year	1584	.
imagine	that	.
and	that	coral	was	growing	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 sh 	 allow 	 	 water 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	1954	,	when	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
now	the	reason	we	know	it	's	1584	is	that	these	 coral 	 s 	 	have	growth	 band 	 s 	 	.
when	you	cut	them	,	slice	 t 	 hose 	 	 core 	 s 	 	in	half	and	x	-	ray	them	,	you	see	these	light	and	dark	 band 	 s 	 	.
each	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	is	a	year	.
we	know	these	 coral 	 s 	 	grow	about	a	centimeter	and	a	half	a	year	.
and	we	just	count	on	down	to	the	bottom	.
then	 the 	 ir 	 	other	 attribut 	 e 	 	is	that	they	have	 th 	 is 	 	great	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
we	can	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	 carbon 	 ate 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	up	the	coral	,	and	there	's	a	whole	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	do	.
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	different	 isotope 	 s 	 	of	oxygen	.
 the 	 ir 	 	ratio	 tell 	 s 	 	us	the	water	temperature	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	,	we	had	 monitor 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	reef	in	galapagos	with	temperature	 record 	 ers 	 	,	so	we	know	the	temperature	of	the	water	the	coral	's	growing	in	.
then	after	we	harvest	a	coral	,	we	measure	 th 	 is 	 	ratio	,	and	now	you	can	see	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 curv 	 es 	 	match	 perfect 	 ly 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	at	these	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 coral 	 s 	 	are	 instrument 	 al 	 	-	quality	 record 	 ers 	 	of	change	in	the	water	.
and	of	course	,	our	 thermo 	 meter 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	take	us	back	50	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	here	.
the	coral	can	take	us	back	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	what	we	do	:	we	've	 merge 	 d 	 	a	lot	of	different	data	 set 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	just	my	group	;	there	's	 may 	 be 	 	30	 group 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	we	get	these	 instrument 	 al 	 	-	and	near	-	 instrument 	 al 	 	-	quality	 record 	 s 	 	of	temperature	change	that	go	back	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	we	put	them	together	.
here	's	a	synthetic	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
there	's	a	whole	family	of	 curv 	 es 	 	here	.
but	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	:	we	're	looking	at	the	last	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	of	temperature	on	the	planet	.
and	there	's	five	or	six	different	 compil 	 ations 	 	there	,	but	each	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 compil 	 ations 	 	 reflect 	 s 	 	 in 	 put 	 	from	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 record 	 s 	 	from	 coral 	 s 	 	.
we	do	similar	 thing 	 s 	 	with	ice	 core 	 s 	 	.
we	work	with	tree	 ring 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	how	we	discover	what	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	natural	and	how	different	is	the	last	century	,	right	?
and	i	chose	 th 	 is 	 	one	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 complic 	 ated 	 	and	 mess 	 y 	 	looking	,	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	 mess 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	there	's	some	 signal 	 s 	 	there	.
some	of	the	 record 	 s 	 	show	lower	 temperature 	 s 	 	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
some	of	them	show	 great 	 er 	 	 vari 	 ability 	 	.
but	they	all	tell	us	what	the	natural	 vari 	 ability 	 	is	.
some	of	them	are	from	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	;	some	are	from	the	entire	 glob 	 e 	 	.
but	here	's	what	we	can	say	:	what	's	natural	in	the	last	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	is	that	the	planet	was	 cool 	 ing 	 	down	.
it	was	 cool 	 ing 	 	down	 un 	 til 	 	about	1900	or	so	.
and	there	is	natural	 vari 	 ability 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	el	ninos	.
a	century	-	scale	,	decadal	-	scale	 vari 	 ability 	 	,	and	we	know	the	 magn 	 itude 	 	;	it	's	about	two	-	 tenth 	 s 	 	to	four	-	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	a	degree	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	.
but	then	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	is	where	we	have	the	 instrument 	 al 	 	record	in	black	.
and	there	's	the	temperature	up	there	in	2009	.
you	know	,	we	've	 warm 	 ed 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	about	a	degree	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	in	the	last	century	,	and	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	the	natural	part	of	that	record	that	 resemble 	 s 	 	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	last	century	.
you	know	,	that	's	the	strength	of	our	argument	,	that	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 tru 	 ly 	 	different	.
so	i	'll	close	with	a	short	 discuss 	 ion 	 	of	ocean	 acid 	 ification 	 	.
i	like	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	component	of	global	change	to	talk	about	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	even	if	you	are	a	hard	-	bitten	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	skeptic	,	and	i	talk	to	that	community	 fair 	 ly 	 	often	,	you	can	not	 den 	 y 	 	the	simple	physics	of	co	2	 dis 	 solving 	 	in	the	ocean	.
you	know	,	we	're	 pump 	 ing 	 	out	 lot 	 s 	 	of	co	2	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	,	from	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	,	from	cement	production	.
right	now	,	about	a	third	of	that	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	is	 dis 	 solving 	 	straight	 in 	 to 	 	the	sea	,	right	?
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	so	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	the	ocean	more	 acid 	 ic 	 	.
so	,	you	can	not	 argu 	 e 	 	with	that	.
that	is	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	right	now	,	and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	issue	than	the	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	issue	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	for	 carbon 	 ate 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	that	build	 the 	 ir 	 	 shell 	 s 	 	out	of	 calc 	 ium 	 	 carbon 	 ate 	 	--	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	both	.
the	main	 frame 	 work 	 	material	of	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	is	 calc 	 ium 	 	 carbon 	 ate 	 	.
that	material	is	more	soluble	in	 acid 	 ic 	 	fluid	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	 organism 	 s 	 	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	more	 metabol 	 ic 	 	energy	to	build	and	maintain	 the 	 ir 	 	 shell 	 s 	 	.
at	some	point	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 trans 	 i 	 ence 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	co	2	 up 	 take 	 	in	the	ocean	 continu 	 es 	 	,	that	material	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	start	to	 dis 	 solve 	 	.
and	on	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	,	where	some	of	the	main	 frame 	 work 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	disappear	,	we	will	see	a	major	loss	of	marine	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
but	it	's	not	just	the	 carbon 	 ate 	 	 produce 	 rs 	 	that	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
there	's	 man 	 y 	 	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 process 	 es 	 	that	are	 influence 	 d 	 	by	the	 acid 	 ity 	 	of	the	ocean	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	 react 	 ions 	 	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	 enzyme 	 s 	 	and	 protein 	 s 	 	are	sensitive	to	the	acid	content	of	the	ocean	.
so	,	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 great 	 er 	 	 metabol 	 ic 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	,	 reduc 	 ed 	 	 re 	 productive 	 	success	,	 change 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 spi 	 ration 	 	and	 metabol 	 ism 	 	.
you	know	,	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	have	good	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	to	expect	to	see	 stress 	 ed 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 trans 	 i 	 ence 	 	.
so	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	to	track	co	2	 level 	 s 	 	in	the	atmosphere	,	going	back	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	used	to	do	it	just	with	ice	 core 	 s 	 	,	but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	're	going	back	20	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	we	take	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	sediment	,	and	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	the	co	2	level	of	the	ocean	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	the	co	2	level	of	the	atmosphere	.
and	here	's	the	thing	:	you	have	to	go	back	about	15	million	 year 	 s 	 	to	find	a	time	when	co	2	 level 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	about	what	they	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
you	have	to	go	back	about	30	million	 year 	 s 	 	to	find	a	time	when	co	2	 level 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	double	what	they	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
now	,	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	all	of	the	 organism 	 s 	 	that	live	in	the	sea	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 chemo 	 stat 	 ted 	 	ocean	,	with	co	2	 level 	 s 	 	lower	than	they	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
that	's	the	reason	that	they	're	not	able	to	respond	or	adapt	to	 th 	 is 	 	rapid	 acid 	 ification 	 	that	's	going	on	right	now	.
so	,	charlie	veron	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	last	year	:	``	the	prospect	of	ocean	 acid 	 ification 	 	may	well	be	the	most	serious	of	all	of	the	 predict 	 ed 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	of	 anthropo 	 genic 	 	co	2	 re 	 lease 	 	.	``
and	i	think	that	may	 ver 	 y 	 	well	be	true	,	so	i	'll	close	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	know	,	we	do	need	the	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	,	but	for	the	sake	of	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	cap	or	limit	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
