 hell 	 o 	 	.	i	would	like	to	start	my	talk	with	 actual 	 ly 	 	two	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	the	first	one	is	:	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	 actual 	 ly 	 	eat	pig	meat	?
 pleas 	 e 	 	raise	your	hand	--	oh	,	that	's	a	lot	.
and	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	live	pig	producing	 th 	 is 	 	meat	?
in	the	last	year	?
in	the	netherlands	--	where	i	come	from	--	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	never	see	a	pig	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	strange	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	on	a	population	of	16	million	people	,	we	have	12	million	 pig 	 s 	 	.
and	well	,	of	course	,	the	dutch	ca	n't	eat	all	these	 pig 	 s 	 	.
they	eat	about	one	-	third	,	and	the	rest	is	 export 	 ed 	 	to	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	in	europe	and	the	rest	of	the	world	.
a	lot	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	u.k.	,	germany	.
and	what	i	was	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	--	 be 	 cause 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	the	whole	pig	would	be	used	up	 un 	 til 	 	the	last	bit	so	 noth 	 ing 	 	would	be	 waste 	 d 	 	--	and	i	was	 cur 	 ious 	 	to	find	out	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	still	the	case	.
and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	 research 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 follow 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	pig	with	number	``	05049	,	``	all	the	way	up	 un 	 til 	 	the	end	and	to	what	 product 	 s 	 	it	's	made	of	.
and	in	these	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	met	all	 kind 	 s 	 	people	like	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 farm 	 ers 	 	and	 butcher 	 s 	 	,	which	 seem 	 s 	 	logical	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	met	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	mold	makers	,	 am 	 mun 	 ition 	 	 produce 	 rs 	 	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	.
and	what	was	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	to	me	is	that	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	no	clue	what	was	made	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 pig 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 consumer 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	in	us	--	had	 al 	 so 	 	no	idea	of	the	 pig 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	all	these	 product 	 s 	 	.
so	what	i	did	is	,	i	took	all	 th 	 is 	 	research	and	i	made	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	--	well	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	's	a	product	catalog	of	 th 	 is 	 	one	pig	,	and	it	 car 	 ries 	 	a	 duplic 	 ate 	 	of	his	ear	tag	on	the	back	.
and	it	 consist 	 s 	 	of	seven	 chapter 	 s 	 	--	the	 chapter 	 s 	 	are	skin	,	 bone 	 s 	 	,	meat	,	internal	 organ 	 s 	 	,	blood	,	fat	and	 mis 	 cell 	 ane 	 ous 	 	.
in	total	,	they	weigh	103.7	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	.
and	to	show	you	how	often	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	meet	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	pig	in	a	regular	day	,	i	want	to	show	you	some	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	book	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	start	the	day	with	a	shower	.
so	,	in	soap	,	fatty	 acid 	 s 	 	made	from	 boil 	 ing 	 	pork	bone	fat	are	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	 hard 	 en 	 ing 	 	agent	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	for	giving	it	a	pearl	-	like	effect	.
then	if	you	look	around	you	in	the	 bath 	 room 	 	,	you	see	 lot 	 s 	 	more	 product 	 s 	 	like	 s 	 ham 	 poo 	 	,	 condition 	 er 	 	,	anti	-	 wrinkl 	 e 	 	cream	,	body	 lot 	 ion 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 tooth 	 paste 	 	.
then	,	so	,	before	 break 	 fast 	 	,	you	've	 al 	 ready 	 	met	the	pig	so	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
then	,	at	 break 	 fast 	 	,	the	pig	that	i	 follow 	 ed 	 	,	the	 hair 	 s 	 	off	the	pig	or	 protein 	 s 	 	from	the	 hair 	 s 	 	off	the	pig	 we 	 re 	 	used	 a 	 s 	 	an	 improv 	 er 	 	of	dough	.
well	,	that	's	what	the	 produce 	 r 	 	 say 	 s 	 	:	it	's	``	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	dough	,	of	course	.	``
in	low	-	fat	butter	,	or	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	low	-	fat	 product 	 s 	 	,	when	you	take	the	fat	out	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	the	taste	and	the	 text 	 ure 	 	out	.
so	what	they	do	is	they	put	gelatin	back	in	,	in	order	to	retain	the	 text 	 ure 	 	.
well	,	when	you	're	off	to	work	,	under	the	road	or	under	the	 building 	 s 	 	that	you	see	,	there	might	 ver 	 y 	 	well	be	cellular	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	light	kind	of	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	 protein 	 s 	 	from	 bone 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	fully	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	.
in	the	train	 brake 	 s 	 	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	german	train	 brake 	 s 	 	--	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	brake	that	's	made	of	bone	ash	.
and	in	 cheese 	 cake 	 	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 dessert 	 s 	 	,	like	chocolate	mousse	,	tiramisu	,	 van 	 illa 	 	 pudd 	 ing 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	 cool 	 ed 	 	in	the	 super 	 market 	 	,	there	's	gelatin	to	make	it	look	good	.
fine	bone	 chin 	 a 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	classic	.
of	course	,	the	bone	in	fine	-	bone	 chin 	 a 	 	 give 	 s 	 	it	 it 	 s 	 	 trans 	 luc 	 ency 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 it 	 s 	 	strength	,	in	order	to	make	these	 re 	 ally 	 	fine	 shape 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 er 	 	.
in	 in 	 terior 	 	 decor 	 ating 	 	,	the	pig	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	there	.
it	's	used	in	paint	for	the	 text 	 ure 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	for	the	 gloss 	 iness 	 	.
in	 sand 	 paper 	 	,	bone	glue	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	glue	between	the	sand	and	the	paper	.
and	then	in	 paint 	 brush 	 es 	 	,	 hair 	 s 	 	are	used	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 suit 	 able 	 	for	making	 paint 	 brush 	 es 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	hard	-	 wear 	 ing 	 	nature	.
i	was	not	 plan 	 ning 	 	on	 show 	 ing 	 	you	any	meat	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	half	the	book	's	meat	and	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	all	know	what	 meat 	 s 	 	they	are	.
but	i	did	n't	want	you	to	 mis 	 s 	 	out	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	well	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 port 	 ion 	 	-	controlled	meat	 cut 	 s 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 old 	 	in	the	 froze 	 n 	 	area	of	the	 super 	 market 	 	.
and	what	it	is	--	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	steak	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	cow	,	but	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	 s 	 laughter 	 	a	cow	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	industrial	 factor 	 y 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	--	they	have	all	these	little	bits	of	steak	left	that	they	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	sell	 a 	 s 	 	steak	,	so	what	they	do	is	they	glue	them	all	together	with	fibrin	from	pig	blood	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	large	sausage	,	then	freeze	the	sausage	,	cut	it	in	little	 slice 	 s 	 	and	sell	 t 	 hose 	 	 a 	 s 	 	steak	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	with	tuna	and	 scal 	 lop 	 s 	 	.
so	,	with	the	steak	,	you	might	drink	a	beer	.
in	the	 brew 	 ing 	 	process	,	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 cloud 	 y 	 	 element 	 s 	 	in	the	beer	,	so	to	get	rid	of	these	 cloud 	 y 	 	 element 	 s 	 	,	what	some	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	do	is	they	pour	the	beer	through	a	sort	of	gelatin	sieve	in	order	to	get	rid	of	that	 cloud 	 iness 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 go 	 es 	 	for	wine	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	fruit	juice	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	company	in	greece	that	 produce 	 s 	 	these	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	contain	hemoglobin	from	 pig 	 s 	 	in	the	filter	.
and	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	them	,	 th 	 is 	 	 create 	 s 	 	an	artificial	lung	in	the	filter	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 health 	 ier 	 	 cigar 	 ette 	 	.
 inject 	 able 	 	 collage 	 n 	 	--	or	,	since	the	'70s	,	 collage 	 n 	 	from	 pig 	 s 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	used	for	 inject 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 wrinkl 	 es 	 	.
and	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 pig 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	close	to	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	so	the	 collage 	 n 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	must	be	the	 strange 	 st 	 	thing	i	found	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bullet	coming	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 am 	 mun 	 ition 	 	company	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	while	i	was	making	the	book	,	i	 contact 	 ed 	 	all	the	 produce 	 rs 	 	of	 product 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	them	to	 s 	 end 	 	me	the	real	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	the	real	 specimen 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 ent 	 	 th 	 is 	 	company	an	email	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 hell 	 o 	 	.	i	'm	christien	.	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	research	.
and	can	you	 s 	 end 	 	me	a	bullet	?	``
and	well	,	i	did	n't	expect	them	to	even	answer	my	email	.
but	they	 answer 	 ed 	 	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	,	thank	you	for	your	email	.	what	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	story	.
are	you	in	 any 	 way 	 	related	to	the	dutch	government	?	``
i	thought	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	dutch	government	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	 email 	 s 	 	to	 any 	 one 	 	.
so	,	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	i	found	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	what	i	think	is	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	--	in	the	book	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	tech	and	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	tech	product	at	the	same	time	.
the	low	-	tech	bit	is	that	it	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	pig	's	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	 mount 	 ed 	 	in	the	high	-	tech	bit	,	which	is	a	 memor 	 y 	 	metal	 ca 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 implant 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	human	heart	 with 	 out 	 	open	heart	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
and	once	it	's	in	the	right	spot	,	they	 re 	 move 	 	the	 out 	 er 	 	shell	,	and	the	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	,	well	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	shape	and	at	that	moment	it	 start 	 s 	 	 beat 	 ing 	 	,	 instant 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	sort	of	 magic 	 al 	 	moment	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	dutch	company	,	so	i	 call 	 ed 	 	them	up	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	can	i	borrow	a	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	from	you	?	``
and	the	makers	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	.
so	they	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	'll	put	it	in	a	jar	for	you	with	 form 	 al 	 in 	 	,	and	you	can	borrow	it	.	``
great	--	and	then	i	did	n't	hear	from	them	for	 week 	 s 	 	,	so	i	 call 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	what	's	going	on	with	the	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	?	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	the	director	of	the	company	 decide 	 d 	 	not	to	let	you	borrow	 th 	 is 	 	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	want	his	product	to	be	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 pig 	 s 	 	.	``
well	,	the	last	product	from	the	book	that	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	is	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	show	that	my	first	question	,	if	 pig 	 s 	 	are	still	used	up	 un 	 til 	 	the	last	bit	,	was	still	true	.
well	it	is	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	ca	n't	be	used	for	 any 	 thing 	 	else	is	made	 in 	 to 	 	a	fuel	that	can	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	source	.
in	total	,	i	found	185	 product 	 s 	 	.
and	what	they	 show 	 ed 	 	me	is	that	,	well	,	 first 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	at	 l 	 east 	 	to	say	odd	that	we	do	n't	treat	these	 pig 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	absolute	 king 	 s 	 	and	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	.
and	the	second	,	is	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	have	a	clue	of	what	all	these	 product 	 s 	 	that	surround	us	are	made	of	.
and	you	might	think	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	fond	of	 pig 	 s 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	well	,	i	am	a	little	bit	--	but	i	'm	more	fond	of	raw	 material 	 s 	 	in	general	.
and	i	think	that	,	in	order	to	take	better	care	of	what	's	 be 	 hind 	 	our	 product 	 s 	 	--	so	,	the	 live 	 stock 	 	,	the	 crop 	 s 	 	,	the	 plant 	 s 	 	,	the	non	-	 renew 	 able 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	people	that	produce	these	 product 	 s 	 	--	the	first	step	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	to	know	that	they	are	there	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
