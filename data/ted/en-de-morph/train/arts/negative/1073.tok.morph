thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
that	was	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	english	.
what	is	a	 c 	 hub 	 by 	 	,	 cur 	 ly 	 	-	haired	guy	from	holland	--	why	is	he	 whistl 	 ing 	 	?
well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	[	 be 	 en 	 	]	 whistl 	 ing 	 	since	the	age	of	four	,	about	four	.
my	dad	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 whistl 	 ing 	 	around	the	house	,	and	i	just	thought	that	's	part	of	communication	in	my	family	.
so	i	 whistl 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	him	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	till	i	was	34	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 annoy 	 ed 	 	and	 irrit 	 ated 	 	people	with	 whistl 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	to	be	honest	,	my	 whistl 	 ing 	 	is	a	kind	of	 de 	 vi 	 ant 	 	behavior	.
i	 whistl 	 ed 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.	i	 whistl 	 ed 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
i	 whistl 	 ed 	 	on	[	my	]	bike	.	i	 whistl 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 whistl 	 ed 	 	at	a	christmas	eve	party	with	my	family	-	in	-	law	.
and	they	had	some	,	in	my	opinion	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	christmas	music	.
and	when	i	hear	music	that	i	do	n't	like	,	i	try	to	make	it	better	.
so	``	rudolph	the	red	-	nosed	reindeer	``	--	you	know	it	?
but	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	sound	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	christmas	party	--	at	 d 	 inner 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 annoy 	 ing 	 	.
so	my	sister	-	in	-	law	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	stop	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	i	just	could	n't	.
and	at	one	point	--	and	i	had	some	wine	,	i	have	to	admit	that	--	at	one	point	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	there	was	a	contest	,	i	would	join	.	``
and	two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	text	 mess 	 age 	 	:	``	you	're	going	to	america	.	``
so	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	america	.
i	would	love	to	,	but	why	?
so	i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	her	up	,	of	course	.
she	googled	,	and	she	found	 th 	 is 	 	world	 whistl 	 ing 	 	 champion 	 ship 	 	in	america	,	of	course	.
she	did	n't	expect	me	to	go	there	.
and	i	would	have	lost	my	face	.
i	do	n't	know	if	that	's	correct	english	.
but	the	dutch	people	here	will	understand	what	i	mean	.
i	lost	my	face	.
and	she	thought	,	``	he	will	never	go	there	.	``
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	did	.
so	i	went	to	louisburg	,	north	carolina	,	 south 	 east 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	world	of	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	world	 champion 	 ship 	 	,	and	i	won	there	in	2004	.
that	was	great	 f 	 un 	 	,	of	course	.
and	to	defend	my	title	--	like	judokas	do	and	 s 	 port 	 s 	 men 	 	--	i	thought	,	well	let	's	go	back	in	2005	,	and	i	won	 aga 	 in 	 	.
then	i	could	n't	 particip 	 ate 	 	for	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	in	2008	i	 enter 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	japan	,	tokyo	,	and	i	won	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	now	is	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	in	rotterdam	,	in	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	city	,	on	a	big	stage	,	and	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	earn	my	money	 whistl 	 ing 	 	at	the	moment	.
so	i	quit	my	day	job	 a 	 s 	 	a	nurse	.
and	i	try	to	live	my	dream	--	well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	never	my	dream	,	but	it	 sound 	 s 	 	so	good	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 whistl 	 ing 	 	here	.
you	say	,	``	huh	,	what	do	you	mean	?	``
well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	are	going	to	 whistl 	 e 	 	 a 	 long 	 	.
and	then	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	:	people	are	 watch 	 ing 	 	each	other	and	think	,	``	oh	,	my	god	.
why	?	can	i	go	away	?	``
no	,	you	ca	n't	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
the	track	that	i	will	 whistl 	 e 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	fÃªte	de	la	belle	.	``
it	's	about	80	 minute 	 s 	 	long	.
no	,	no	,	no	.	it	's	four	 minute 	 s 	 	long	.
and	i	want	to	first	 rehears 	 e 	 	with	you	your	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	 whistl 	 e 	 	the	tone	.
sorry	.	i	 for 	 got 	 	one	thing	.
you	 whistl 	 e 	 	the	same	tone	 a 	 s 	 	me	.
i	heard	a	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 tone 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	promising	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	promising	.
i	'll	ask	the	 technician 	 s 	 	to	start	the	music	.
and	if	it	's	 start 	 ed 	 	,	i	just	point	where	you	 whistl 	 e 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	we	will	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
oh	,	hah	.
i	'm	so	sorry	,	 technician 	 s 	 	.
