so	 historic 	 ally 	 	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	huge	divide	between	what	people	consider	to	be	non	-	living	 system 	 s 	 	on	one	side	,	and	living	 system 	 s 	 	on	the	other	side	.
so	we	go	from	,	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	complex	crystal	 a 	 s 	 	non	-	life	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	complex	cat	on	the	other	side	.
over	the	last	hundred	and	fifty	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	,	science	 ha 	 s 	 	kind	of	 blur 	 red 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	non	-	living	and	living	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	now	we	consider	that	there	may	be	a	kind	of	 continu 	 um 	 	that	 exist 	 s 	 	between	the	two	.
we	'll	just	take	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	:	a	virus	is	a	natural	system	,	right	?
but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 istic 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	satisfy	all	the	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	all	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	living	 system 	 s 	 	and	is	in	fact	a	 parasit 	 e 	 	on	other	living	 system 	 s 	 	in	order	to	,	say	,	 re 	 produce 	 	and	evolve	.
but	what	we	're	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	 to 	 night 	 	are	 experiment 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	non	-	living	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	spectrum	--	so	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	chemical	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	 mix 	 ing 	 	together	 non 	 living 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	to	make	new	 structure 	 s 	 	,	and	that	these	new	 structure 	 s 	 	might	have	some	of	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	living	 system 	 s 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	a	kind	of	artificial	life	.
so	what	are	these	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?	these	are	them	.
we	consider	first	that	life	 ha 	 s 	 	a	body	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	distinguish	the	self	from	the	environment	.
life	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 metabol 	 ism 	 	.	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	process	by	which	life	can	convert	 resource 	 s 	 	from	the	environment	 in 	 to 	 	building	 block 	 s 	 	so	it	can	maintain	and	build	 it 	 self 	 	.
life	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 inherit 	 able 	 	information	.
now	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	store	our	information	 a 	 s 	 	dna	in	our	 genome 	 s 	 	and	we	pass	 th 	 is 	 	information	on	to	our	 off 	 spring 	 	.
if	we	couple	the	first	two	--	the	body	and	the	 metabol 	 ism 	 	--	we	can	come	up	with	a	system	that	could	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	move	and	replicate	,	and	if	we	 couple 	 d 	 	these	now	to	 inherit 	 able 	 	information	,	we	can	come	up	with	a	system	that	would	be	more	 life 	 like 	 	,	and	would	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	evolve	.
and	so	these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	will	try	to	do	in	the	lab	,	make	some	 experiment 	 s 	 	that	have	one	or	more	of	these	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	life	.
so	how	do	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	well	,	we	use	a	model	system	that	we	term	a	 proto 	 cell 	 	.
you	might	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	kind	of	like	a	primitive	cell	.	it	is	a	simple	chemical	model	of	a	living	cell	,	and	if	you	consider	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	a	cell	in	your	body	may	have	on	the	order	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	need	to	come	together	,	play	together	in	a	complex	network	to	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	call	 al 	 ive 	 	.
in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	what	we	want	to	do	is	much	the	same	,	but	with	on	the	order	of	 ten 	 s 	 	of	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	--	so	a	drastic	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	but	still	 try 	 ing 	 	to	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	 life 	 like 	 	.
and	so	what	we	do	is	,	we	start	simple	and	we	work	our	way	up	to	living	 system 	 s 	 	.
consider	for	a	moment	 th 	 is 	 	quote	by	leduc	,	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 consider 	 ing 	 	a	kind	of	synthetic	biology	:	``	the	synthesis	of	life	,	should	it	ever	occur	,	will	not	be	the	sensational	 discover 	 y 	 	which	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	associate	with	the	idea	.	``
that	's	his	first	 state 	 ment 	 	.	so	if	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	life	in	the	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	,	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	going	to	impact	our	 live 	 s 	 	at	all	.
``	if	we	accept	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	evolution	,	then	the	first	dawn	of	synthesis	of	life	must	consist	in	the	production	of	 form 	 s 	 	 inter 	 mediate 	 	between	the	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	and	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	world	,	or	between	the	non	-	living	and	living	world	,	 form 	 s 	 	which	possess	 on 	 ly 	 	some	of	the	 rud 	 imentary 	 	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	life	``	--	so	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	i	just	 discuss 	 ed 	 	--	``	to	which	other	 attribut 	 es 	 	will	be	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	in	the	course	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	by	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 action 	 s 	 	of	the	environment	.	``
so	we	start	simple	,	we	make	some	 structure 	 s 	 	that	may	have	some	of	these	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	life	,	and	then	we	try	to	develop	that	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	 life 	 like 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	can	start	to	make	a	 proto 	 cell 	 	.
we	use	 th 	 is 	 	idea	 call 	 ed 	 	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	.
what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	,	i	can	mix	some	 chemical 	 s 	 	together	in	a	test	tube	in	my	lab	,	and	these	 chemical 	 s 	 	will	start	to	self	-	associate	to	form	 large 	 r 	 	and	 large 	 r 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
so	say	on	the	order	of	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	will	come	together	to	form	a	large	structure	that	did	n't	exist	before	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	what	i	took	is	some	membrane	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	 mix 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	together	in	the	right	environment	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	 second 	 s 	 	it	 form 	 s 	 	these	 ra 	 ther 	 	complex	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	here	.
these	 membrane 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	similar	,	 morpho 	 logically 	 	and	 functional 	 ly 	 	,	to	the	 membrane 	 s 	 	in	your	body	,	and	we	can	use	these	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	say	,	to	form	the	body	of	our	 proto 	 cell 	 	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	we	can	work	with	oil	and	water	 system 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	when	you	put	oil	and	water	together	,	they	do	n't	mix	,	but	through	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	we	can	get	a	nice	oil	 drop 	 let 	 	to	form	,	and	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	body	for	our	artificial	organism	or	for	our	 proto 	 cell 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	will	see	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	that	's	just	 form 	 ing 	 	some	body	stuff	,	right	?
some	 architect 	 ures 	 	.
what	about	the	other	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	living	 system 	 s 	 	?
so	we	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 proto 	 cell 	 	model	here	that	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	natural	 occur 	 ring 	 	clay	 call 	 ed 	 	 mon 	 tmorillo 	 nite 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	natural	from	the	environment	,	 th 	 is 	 	clay	.
it	 form 	 s 	 	a	surface	that	is	,	say	,	 chemical 	 ly 	 	active	.
it	could	run	a	 metabol 	 ism 	 	on	it	.
certain	kind	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	like	to	associate	with	the	clay	.	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	rna	,	 show 	 n 	 	in	red	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 relat 	 ive 	 	of	dna	,	it	's	an	 information 	 al 	 	molecule	--	it	can	come	 a 	 long 	 	and	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	associate	with	the	surface	of	 th 	 is 	 	clay	.
 th 	 is 	 	structure	,	then	,	can	organize	the	 form 	 ation 	 	of	a	membrane	 bound 	 ary 	 	around	 it 	 self 	 	,	so	it	can	make	a	body	of	liquid	 molecule 	 s 	 	around	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	that	's	 show 	 n 	 	in	green	here	on	 th 	 is 	 	 micro 	 graph 	 	.
so	just	through	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	,	 mix 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	in	the	lab	,	we	can	come	up	with	,	say	,	a	 metabol 	 ic 	 	surface	with	some	 information 	 al 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	membrane	body	,	right	?
so	we	're	on	a	road	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	living	 system 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	saw	 th 	 is 	 	 proto 	 cell 	 	,	you	would	not	 con 	 fuse 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 life 	 less 	 	.	once	it	 form 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
so	,	 some 	 thing 	 	is	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
some	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
so	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	you	had	a	flow	of	energy	through	a	system	,	what	we	'd	want	is	a	 proto 	 cell 	 	that	can	harvest	some	of	that	energy	in	order	to	maintain	 it 	 self 	 	,	much	like	living	 system 	 s 	 	do	.
so	we	came	up	with	a	different	 proto 	 cell 	 	model	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 simpl 	 er 	 	than	the	previous	one	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 proto 	 cell 	 	model	,	it	's	just	an	oil	 drop 	 let 	 	,	but	a	chemical	 metabol 	 ism 	 	 in 	 side 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 proto 	 cell 	 	to	use	energy	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	dynamic	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	'll	see	here	.
you	add	the	 drop 	 let 	 	to	the	system	.
it	's	a	pool	of	water	,	and	the	 proto 	 cell 	 	 start 	 s 	 	moving	 it 	 self 	 	around	in	the	system	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	oil	 drop 	 let 	 	 form 	 s 	 	through	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	chemical	 metabol 	 ism 	 	 in 	 side 	 	so	it	can	use	energy	,	and	it	uses	that	energy	to	move	 it 	 self 	 	around	in	 it 	 s 	 	environment	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	 move 	 ment 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	living	 system 	 s 	 	.
it	is	moving	around	,	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	environment	,	and	 re 	 model 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	environment	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	,	by	these	chemical	 wave 	 s 	 	that	are	 form 	 ing 	 	by	the	 proto 	 cell 	 	.
so	it	's	 act 	 ing 	 	,	in	a	sense	,	like	a	living	system	 try 	 ing 	 	to	preserve	 it 	 self 	 	.
we	take	 th 	 is 	 	same	moving	 proto 	 cell 	 	here	,	and	we	put	it	in	 an 	 other 	 	experiment	,	get	it	moving	.	then	i	'm	going	to	add	some	food	to	the	system	,	and	you	'll	see	that	in	blue	here	,	right	?
so	i	add	some	food	source	to	the	system	.
the	 proto 	 cell 	 	 move 	 s 	 	.	it	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	the	food	.
it	 reconfigur 	 es 	 	 it 	 self 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	then	is	able	to	climb	to	the	highest	 concent 	 ration 	 	of	food	in	that	system	and	stop	there	.
 al 	 right 	 	?	so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	system	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	body	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 metabol 	 ism 	 	,	it	can	use	energy	,	it	 move 	 s 	 	around	.
it	can	sense	 it 	 s 	 	local	environment	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	find	 resource 	 s 	 	in	the	environment	to	sustain	 it 	 self 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	brain	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	neural	system	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	 s 	 ack 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	that	is	able	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	complex	 life 	 like 	 	behavior	.
if	we	count	the	number	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	that	system	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	water	that	's	in	the	dish	,	we	have	five	 chemical 	 s 	 	that	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	then	we	put	these	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	together	in	a	single	experiment	to	see	what	they	would	do	,	and	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 condition 	 s 	 	,	we	have	some	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	on	the	left	that	are	moving	around	and	it	 like 	 s 	 	to	touch	the	other	 structure 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	environment	.
on	the	other	hand	we	have	two	moving	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	that	like	to	circle	each	other	,	and	they	form	a	kind	of	a	dance	,	a	complex	dance	with	each	other	.
right	?	so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	individual	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	have	behavior	,	what	we	've	 interpret 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	behavior	in	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 bas 	 ically 	 	population	-	level	behavior	similar	to	what	 organism 	 s 	 	have	.
so	now	that	you	're	all	 expert 	 s 	 	on	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	play	a	game	with	these	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	make	two	different	 kind 	 s 	 	.
 proto 	 cell 	 	a	 ha 	 s 	 	a	certain	kind	of	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 in 	 side 	 	that	,	when	 activate 	 d 	 	,	the	 proto 	 cell 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	 vib 	 rate 	 	around	,	just	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
so	remember	,	these	are	primitive	 thing 	 s 	 	,	so	 danc 	 ing 	 	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	us	.
the	second	 proto 	 cell 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	different	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	and	when	 activate 	 d 	 	,	the	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	all	come	together	and	they	fuse	 in 	 to 	 	one	big	one	.	right	?
and	we	just	put	these	two	together	in	the	same	system	.
so	there	's	population	a	,	there	's	population	b	,	and	then	we	activate	the	system	,	and	 proto 	 cell 	 	bs	,	they	're	the	blue	 one 	 s 	 	,	they	all	come	together	.	they	fuse	together	to	form	one	big	blob	,	and	the	other	 proto 	 cell 	 	just	 dance 	 s 	 	around	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	just	 happen 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	all	of	the	energy	in	the	system	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	used	up	,	and	then	,	game	over	.
so	then	i	 repeat 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	a	bunch	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	one	time	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	i	 add 	 ed 	 	these	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	together	to	the	system	,	and	 proto 	 cell 	 	a	and	 proto 	 cell 	 	b	fused	together	to	form	a	hybrid	 proto 	 cell 	 	ab	.
that	did	n't	happen	before	.	there	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
there	's	a	 proto 	 cell 	 	ab	now	in	 th 	 is 	 	system	.
 proto 	 cell 	 	ab	 like 	 s 	 	to	dance	around	for	a	bit	,	while	 proto 	 cell 	 	b	 do 	 es 	 	the	fusing	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
but	then	 some 	 thing 	 	even	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
watch	when	these	two	large	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	hybrid	 one 	 s 	 	,	fuse	together	.
now	we	have	a	 danc 	 ing 	 	 proto 	 cell 	 	and	a	self	-	 replica 	 tion 	 	event	.	right	.
just	with	 blob 	 s 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	the	way	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	is	,	you	have	a	simple	system	of	five	 chemical 	 s 	 	here	,	a	simple	system	here	.	when	they	 hybrid 	 ize 	 	,	you	then	form	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	different	than	before	,	it	's	more	complex	than	before	,	and	you	get	the	emergence	of	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	 life 	 like 	 	behavior	which	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	is	 replica 	 tion 	 	.
so	since	we	can	make	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	that	we	like	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	 color 	 s 	 	and	 interest 	 ing 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	make	,	and	they	have	 interest 	 ing 	 	 life 	 like 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	these	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	tell	us	about	the	origin	of	life	on	the	earth	.	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	these	represent	an	 eas 	 ily 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	step	,	one	of	the	first	 step 	 s 	 	by	which	life	got	 start 	 ed 	 	on	the	early	earth	.
 certain 	 ly 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	present	on	the	early	earth	,	but	they	would	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	these	 pur 	 e 	 	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	that	we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	in	the	lab	and	i	 show 	 ed 	 	in	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	they	'd	be	a	real	complex	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 un 	 controlled 	 	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	produce	a	 divers 	 e 	 	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 organ 	 ic 	 	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	.
think	of	it	like	a	primordial	 ooz 	 e 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
and	it	's	a	pool	that	's	too	difficult	to	fully	 character 	 ize 	 	,	even	by	modern	 method 	 s 	 	,	and	the	product	 look 	 s 	 	 brow 	 n 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	tar	here	on	the	left	.	a	 pur 	 e 	 	 com 	 pound 	 	is	 show 	 n 	 	on	the	right	,	for	contrast	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	similar	to	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	take	 pur 	 e 	 	sugar	 crystal 	 s 	 	in	your	kitchen	,	you	put	them	in	a	pan	,	and	you	 app 	 ly 	 	energy	.
you	turn	up	the	heat	,	you	start	making	or	 break 	 ing 	 	chemical	 bond 	 s 	 	in	the	sugar	,	 form 	 ing 	 	a	 brow 	 nish 	 	caramel	,	right	?
if	you	let	that	go	 un 	 regulat 	 ed 	 	,	you	'll	 continu 	 e 	 	to	make	and	break	chemical	 bond 	 s 	 	,	 form 	 ing 	 	an	even	more	 divers 	 e 	 	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	then	 form 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	black	 tar 	 ry 	 	stuff	in	your	pan	,	right	,	that	's	difficult	to	wash	out	.	so	that	's	what	the	origin	of	life	would	have	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
you	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	life	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	junk	that	is	present	on	the	early	earth	,	four	,	4.5	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	then	is	,	throw	away	all	your	 pur 	 e 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	,	and	try	to	make	some	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	with	 life 	 like 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	primordial	 ooz 	 e 	 	.
so	we	're	able	to	then	see	the	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	of	these	oil	 drop 	 let 	 	bodies	 aga 	 in 	 	that	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 previous 	 ly 	 	,	and	the	black	 spot 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	there	represent	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	black	tar	--	 th 	 is 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	,	 organ 	 ic 	 	black	tar	.
and	we	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	and	then	we	watch	 live 	 ly 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	.
they	look	 re 	 ally 	 	good	,	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	they	appear	to	have	some	kind	of	behavior	where	they	kind	of	circle	around	each	other	and	follow	each	other	,	similar	to	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	before	--	but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	just	primordial	 condition 	 s 	 	,	no	 pur 	 e 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 al 	 so 	 	,	these	tar	-	 fuel 	 ed 	 	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	are	 al 	 so 	 	able	to	locate	 resource 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	.
i	'm	going	to	add	some	resource	from	the	left	,	here	,	that	 de 	 fuse 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	,	and	you	can	see	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	like	that	.
they	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 energ 	 etic 	 	,	and	able	to	find	the	resource	in	the	environment	,	similar	to	what	we	saw	before	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	these	are	 d 	 one 	 	in	these	primordial	 condition 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 mess 	 y 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	not	sort	of	 steril 	 e 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	little	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	.
but	they	have	 life 	 like 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	,	is	the	point	.
so	,	 do 	 ing 	 	these	artificial	life	 experiment 	 s 	 	 help 	 s 	 	us	define	a	potential	path	between	non	-	living	and	living	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	it	 help 	 s 	 	us	 broad 	 en 	 	our	view	of	what	life	is	and	what	possible	life	there	could	be	out	there	--	life	that	could	be	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	life	that	we	find	here	on	earth	.
and	that	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	the	next	term	,	which	is	``	weird	life	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	term	by	steve	benner	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	used	in	 re 	 ference 	 	to	a	report	in	2007	by	the	national	research	council	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 where 	 in 	 	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	how	we	can	look	for	life	 else 	 where 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	that	life	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	life	on	earth	.	if	we	went	to	 an 	 other 	 	planet	and	we	thought	there	might	be	life	there	,	how	could	we	even	 recogn 	 ize 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	life	?
well	,	they	came	up	with	three	 ver 	 y 	 	general	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	.	first	is	--	and	they	're	 list 	 ed 	 	here	.
the	first	is	,	the	system	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	in	non	-	equilibrium	.	that	 mean 	 s 	 	the	system	can	not	be	dead	,	in	a	matter	of	fact	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	,	you	have	an	 in 	 put 	 	of	energy	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	that	life	can	use	and	exploit	to	maintain	 it 	 self 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	similar	to	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	 shin 	 ing 	 	on	the	earth	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	 photo 	 synthesis 	 	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	 eco 	 system 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	there	's	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	no	life	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	life	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	in	liquid	form	,	so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	even	if	we	had	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	together	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	solid	,	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	good	place	for	life	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	to	be	able	to	make	and	break	chemical	 bond 	 s 	 	.	and	 aga 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	life	 transform 	 s 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	from	the	environment	 in 	 to 	 	building	 block 	 s 	 	so	it	can	maintain	 it 	 self 	 	.
now	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	told	you	about	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	and	weird	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	--	some	that	contain	clay	,	some	that	have	primordial	 ooz 	 e 	 	in	them	,	some	that	have	 bas 	 ically 	 	oil	 in 	 stead 	 	of	water	 in 	 side 	 	of	them	.
most	of	these	do	n't	contain	dna	,	but	yet	they	have	 life 	 like 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
but	these	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	satisfy	these	general	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	of	living	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	by	making	these	chemical	,	artificial	life	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	we	hope	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	understand	 some 	 thing 	 	fundamental	about	the	origin	of	life	and	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	life	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	what	possible	life	there	could	be	out	there	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	thank	you	.
