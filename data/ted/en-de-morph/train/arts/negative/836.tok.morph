the	 great 	 est 	 	 iron 	 y 	 	in	global	health	is	that	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	carry	the	largest	disease	burden	.
if	we	 re 	 s 	 ize 	 	the	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	in	proportion	to	the	subject	of	interest	,	we	see	that	sub	-	saharan	africa	is	the	worst	hit	region	by	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	of	our	time	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	region	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 l 	 east 	 	 cap 	 ability 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	disease	.
there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	these	 count 	 ries 	 	do	not	have	the	 resource 	 s 	 	that	are	 need 	 ed 	 	to	cope	with	 s 	 uch 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 s 	 	.
so	what	the	western	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	have	 gen 	 er 	 ously 	 	 d 	 one 	 	is	they	have	 pro 	 posed 	 	to	provide	free	 drug 	 s 	 	to	all	people	in	third	world	 count 	 ries 	 	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	ca	n't	afford	these	 medic 	 ations 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 prevent 	 ed 	 	entire	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	from	 cap 	 s 	 izing 	 	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
but	there	is	a	fundamental	problem	that	is	 kill 	 ing 	 	the	 effort 	 s 	 	in	 fight 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	disease	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	keep	 throw 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	out	at	people	who	do	n't	have	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	you	end	up	creating	a	problem	of	drug	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	happen	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
the	problem	is	that	,	what	 begin 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	in	the	third	world	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	global	problem	.
and	the	last	thing	we	want	to	see	is	drug	-	resistant	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	hiv	 pop 	 ping 	 	up	all	over	the	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	make	 treat 	 ment 	 	more	expensive	and	it	could	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 store 	 	the	pre	-	arv	 car 	 n 	 age 	 	of	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.
i	 experience 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 first 	 hand 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	high	school	student	in	uganda	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	in	the	90s	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	peak	of	the	hiv	 epi 	 demic 	 	,	before	there	 we 	 re 	 	any	arvs	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	lost	more	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	who	taught	me	,	to	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	one	of	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 ions 	 	of	my	life	,	to	help	find	real	 solution 	 s 	 	that	could	address	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
we	all	know	about	the	miracle	of	 miniatur 	 ization 	 	.
back	in	the	day	,	 computer 	 s 	 	used	to	fill	 th 	 is 	 	entire	room	,	and	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	to	work	 in 	 side 	 	the	 computer 	 s 	 	.
but	what	 electron 	 ic 	 	 miniatur 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	is	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	people	to	shrink	technology	 in 	 to 	 	a	cell	phone	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 every 	 one 	 	here	 enjoy 	 s 	 	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	used	in	the	remote	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	in	the	third	world	 count 	 ries 	 	.
the	good	news	is	that	the	same	technology	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	 miniatur 	 ization 	 	of	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	is	now	 allow 	 ing 	 	us	to	 miniatur 	 ize 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	.
so	,	right	now	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 miniatur 	 ize 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	and	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	onto	 micro 	 fluid 	 ic 	 	 chip 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	come	to	the	us	right	after	high	school	,	and	was	able	to	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	technology	and	develop	some	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 micro 	 fluid 	 ic 	 	chip	that	i	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
a	close	look	at	how	the	technology	 work 	 s 	 	:	these	are	 channel 	 s 	 	that	are	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	human	hair	--	so	you	have	 integrate 	 d 	 	 val 	 ves 	 	,	 pump 	 s 	 	,	 mix 	 ers 	 	and	 inject 	 ors 	 	--	so	you	can	fit	entire	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	onto	a	 micro 	 fluid 	 ic 	 	system	.
so	what	i	plan	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	technology	is	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	the	current	state	of	the	technology	and	build	an	hiv	kit	in	a	 micro 	 fluid 	 ic 	 	system	.
so	,	with	one	 micro 	 fluid 	 ic 	 	chip	,	which	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	an	iphone	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 diagnos 	 e 	 	100	 patient 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
for	each	patient	,	we	will	be	able	to	do	up	to	100	different	viral	 load 	 s 	 	per	patient	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	four	 hour 	 s 	 	,	50	 time 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	the	current	state	of	the	art	,	at	a	cost	that	will	be	five	to	500	 time 	 s 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	than	the	current	 option 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	will	allow	us	to	create	 personal 	 ized 	 	 medicine 	 s 	 	in	the	third	world	at	a	cost	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 able 	 	and	make	the	world	a	 safe 	 r 	 	place	.
i	 invit 	 e 	 	your	interest	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	your	 involve 	 ment 	 	in	 driv 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	vision	to	a	point	of	practical	 re 	 ality 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
