so	what	 do 	 es 	 	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	man	in	the	world	look	like	?
he	 certain 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	me	.
he	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
his	name	is	matthieu	ricard	.
so	how	do	you	get	to	be	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	man	in	the	world	?
well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	is	a	way	to	measure	happiness	in	the	brain	.
and	you	do	that	by	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	 activ 	 ation 	 	of	the	left	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	in	the	fmri	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	right	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	.
and	matthieu	's	happiness	measure	is	off	the	 chart 	 s 	 	.
he	's	by	far	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	man	ever	 measur 	 ed 	 	by	science	.
which	 lead 	 s 	 	us	to	a	question	:	what	was	he	 think 	 ing 	 	when	he	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 naught 	 y 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	he	was	 medit 	 ating 	 	on	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
matthieu	's	own	experience	is	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	state	ever	.
 read 	 ing 	 	about	matthieu	was	one	of	the	 pivot 	 al 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	my	life	.
my	dream	is	to	create	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	world	peace	in	my	 life 	 time 	 	--	and	to	do	that	by	creating	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	inner	peace	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	on	a	global	scale	.
and	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	matthieu	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	new	angle	to	look	at	my	work	.
matthieu	's	brain	 s 	 can 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	not	a	chore	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 create 	 s 	 	happiness	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 f 	 un 	 	.
and	that	mind	-	 blow 	 ing 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	 change 	 s 	 	the	entire	game	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	 compass 	 ion 	 	was	a	chore	,	 no 	 body 	 	's	going	to	do	it	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	 may 	 be 	 	the	dalai	lama	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
but	if	 compass 	 ion 	 	was	 f 	 un 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	going	to	do	it	.
to	create	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	global	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	all	we	have	to	do	is	to	 re 	 frame 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 f 	 un 	 	.
but	 f 	 un 	 	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
what	if	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 profit 	 able 	 	?
what	if	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	good	for	business	?
then	,	every	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	,	every	 manage 	 r 	 	in	the	world	,	will	want	to	have	 compass 	 ion 	 	--	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
that	would	create	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	world	peace	.
so	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	what	 compass 	 ion 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	in	a	business	setting	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	did	n't	have	to	look	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	i	was	looking	for	was	right	in	front	of	my	 eye 	 s 	 	--	in	google	,	my	company	.
i	know	there	are	other	 com 	 passionate 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	the	world	,	but	google	is	the	place	i	'm	familiar	with	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	there	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	so	i	'll	use	google	 a 	 s 	 	the	case	 stud 	 y 	 	.
google	is	a	company	born	of	 ideal 	 ism 	 	.
it	's	a	company	that	 thriv 	 es 	 	on	 ideal 	 ism 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 organ 	 ic 	 	and	 wide 	 spread 	 	company	-	wide	.
in	google	,	 express 	 ions 	 	of	corporate	 compass 	 ion 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	follow	the	same	pattern	.
it	's	sort	of	a	funny	pattern	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	with	a	small	group	of	googlers	taking	the	 initi 	 ative 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	they	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	ask	for	 per 	 mission 	 	;	they	just	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	do	it	,	and	then	other	googlers	join	in	,	and	it	just	 get 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	big	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	official	.
so	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 start 	 s 	 	from	the	bottom	up	.
and	let	me	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
the	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	the	largest	annual	community	event	--	where	googlers	from	around	the	world	 don 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	labor	to	 the 	 ir 	 	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	--	was	 initi 	 ated 	 	and	 organize 	 d 	 	by	three	 employ 	 ees 	 	before	it	 be 	 came 	 	official	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	just	 be 	 came 	 	too	big	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	three	googlers	--	a	chef	,	an	engineer	and	,	most	funny	,	a	 mass 	 age 	 	therapist	--	three	of	them	,	they	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	a	region	in	india	where	200,000	people	live	 with 	 out 	 	a	single	medical	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
so	what	do	they	do	?
they	just	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	start	a	 fund 	 raise 	 r 	 	.
and	they	raise	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	hospital	--	the	first	hospital	of	 it 	 s 	 	kind	for	200,000	people	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 ha 	 iti 	 	 earth 	 quake 	 	,	a	number	of	 engineer 	 s 	 	and	product	 manage 	 rs 	 	 spontane 	 ously 	 	came	together	and	 stay 	 ed 	 	 over 	 night 	 	to	build	a	tool	to	allow	 earth 	 quake 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	to	find	 the 	 ir 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	 express 	 ions 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	found	in	our	 inter 	 national 	 	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	.
in	 chin 	 a 	 	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	one	mid	-	level	 employ 	 ee 	 	 initi 	 ated 	 	the	largest	social	action	 com 	 petition 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	more	than	1,000	 school 	 s 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 issue 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	education	,	poverty	,	health	care	and	the	environment	.
there	is	so	much	 organ 	 ic 	 	social	action	all	around	google	that	the	company	 decide 	 d 	 	to	form	a	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	team	just	to	support	these	 effort 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	came	from	the	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	,	from	two	googlers	who	wrote	 the 	 ir 	 	own	job	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	and	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	for	the	job	.
and	i	found	it	 fasci 	 nating 	 	that	the	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	team	was	not	 form 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	some	grand	corporate	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
it	was	two	 person 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	let	's	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	and	the	company	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	google	is	a	 com 	 passionate 	 	company	,	 be 	 cause 	 	googlers	found	 compass 	 ion 	 	to	be	 f 	 un 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 f 	 un 	 	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
there	are	 al 	 so 	 	real	business	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
so	what	are	they	?
the	first	benefit	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	that	it	 create 	 s 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	effective	business	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
there	are	three	 component 	 s 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
there	is	the	 affect 	 ive 	 	component	,	which	is	,	``	i	feel	for	you	.	``
there	is	the	cognitive	component	,	which	is	,	``	i	understand	you	.	``
and	there	is	a	 motiv 	 ation 	 al 	 	component	,	which	is	,	``	i	want	to	help	you	.	``
so	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	got	to	do	with	business	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	?
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	led	by	jim	collins	,	and	 document 	 ed 	 	in	the	book	``	good	to	great	,	``	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	kind	of	 lead 	 er 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	company	from	 good 	 ness 	 	to	 great 	 ness 	 	.
and	he	 call 	 s 	 	them	``	level	5	 lead 	 ers 	 	.	``
these	are	 lead 	 ers 	 	who	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	,	possess	two	 import 	 ant 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	,	and	they	are	 humil 	 ity 	 	and	 ambit 	 ion 	 	.
these	are	 lead 	 ers 	 	who	are	 high 	 ly 	 	 ambit 	 ious 	 	for	the	 great 	 er 	 	good	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 ambit 	 ious 	 	for	a	 great 	 er 	 	good	,	they	feel	no	need	to	 infla 	 te 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 ego 	 s 	 	.
and	they	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	research	,	make	the	best	business	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	if	you	look	at	these	 qual 	 ities 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	we	find	that	the	cognitive	and	 affect 	 ive 	 	 component 	 s 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	--	 understand 	 ing 	 	people	and	 empath 	 izing 	 	with	people	--	 inhibit 	 s 	 	,	 tone 	 s 	 	down	,	what	i	call	the	 excess 	 ive 	 	self	-	obsession	that	's	in	us	,	 there 	 fore 	 	creating	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	 humil 	 ity 	 	.
the	 motiv 	 ation 	 al 	 	component	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	 create 	 s 	 	 ambit 	 ion 	 	for	 great 	 er 	 	good	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	the	way	to	grow	level	5	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	 compel 	 ling 	 	business	benefit	.
the	second	 compel 	 ling 	 	benefit	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	that	it	 create 	 s 	 	an	inspiring	 work 	 force 	 	.
 employ 	 ees 	 	 mutual 	 ly 	 	inspire	each	other	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	good	.
it	 create 	 s 	 	a	 vib 	 rant 	 	,	 energ 	 etic 	 	community	where	people	admire	and	respect	each	other	.
i	mean	,	you	come	to	work	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	work	with	three	 guy 	 s 	 	who	just	up	and	decide	to	build	a	hospital	in	india	.
it	's	like	how	can	you	not	be	inspired	by	 t 	 hose 	 	people	--	your	own	 co 	 work 	 ers 	 	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	mutual	inspiration	 promote 	 s 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 initi 	 ative 	 	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	us	a	 high 	 ly 	 	effective	company	.
so	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	all	that	,	what	is	the	secret	formula	for	 brew 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	in	the	corporate	setting	?
in	our	experience	,	there	are	three	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
the	first	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	is	to	create	a	culture	of	passionate	concern	for	the	 great 	 er 	 	good	.
so	 al 	 ways 	 	think	:	how	is	your	company	and	your	job	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	 great 	 er 	 	good	?
or	,	how	can	you	further	serve	the	 great 	 er 	 	good	?
 th 	 is 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	 great 	 er 	 	good	is	 ver 	 y 	 	self	-	inspiring	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	 fertil 	 e 	 	ground	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	to	grow	in	.
that	's	one	.
the	second	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	is	 auto 	 nomy 	 	.
so	in	google	,	there	's	a	lot	of	 auto 	 nomy 	 	.
and	one	of	our	most	popular	 manage 	 rs 	 	 joke 	 s 	 	that	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	google	is	a	place	where	the	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	run	the	asylum	.	``
and	he	 consider 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	one	of	the	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	.
if	you	 al 	 ready 	 	have	a	culture	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	 ideal 	 ism 	 	and	you	let	your	people	roam	free	,	they	will	do	the	right	thing	in	the	most	 com 	 passionate 	 	way	.
the	third	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	is	to	focus	on	inner	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	personal	growth	.
 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	training	in	google	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 place 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 emphas 	 is 	 	on	the	inner	 qual 	 ities 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	self	-	 aware 	 ness 	 	,	self	-	 master 	 y 	 	,	 empath 	 y 	 	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	with	character	.
we	even	 create 	 d 	 	a	seven	-	week	curriculum	on	emotion	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	which	we	 jok 	 ing 	 ly 	 	call	``	 search 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.	``
it	's	less	 naught 	 y 	 	than	it	 sound 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	an	engineer	by	training	,	but	i	'm	one	of	the	 creator 	 s 	 	and	 instruct 	 ors 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	course	,	which	i	find	kind	of	funny	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	company	that	 trust 	 s 	 	an	engineer	to	teach	emotion	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
what	a	company	.
so	``	search	 in 	 side 	 	 your 	 self 	 	``	--	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
it	 work 	 s 	 	in	three	 step 	 s 	 	.
the	first	step	is	attention	training	.
attention	is	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	all	 high 	 er 	 	cognitive	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	abilities	.
 there 	 fore 	 	,	any	curriculum	for	training	emotion	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	begin	with	attention	training	.
the	idea	here	is	to	train	attention	to	create	a	quality	of	mind	that	is	calm	and	clear	at	the	same	time	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 create 	 s 	 	the	 found 	 ation 	 	for	emotion	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
the	second	step	 follow 	 s 	 	the	first	step	.
the	second	step	is	 develop 	 ing 	 	self	-	knowledge	and	self	-	 master 	 y 	 	.
so	using	the	 super 	 charged 	 	attention	from	step	one	,	we	create	a	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	cognitive	and	 e 	 motive 	 	 process 	 es 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 observ 	 e 	 	our	thought	stream	and	the	process	of	emotion	with	high	 clar 	 ity 	 	,	 object 	 ivity 	 	and	from	a	third	-	person	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
and	once	you	can	do	that	,	you	create	the	kind	of	self	-	knowledge	that	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	self	-	 master 	 y 	 	.
the	third	step	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	second	step	,	is	to	create	new	mental	 habit 	 s 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	.
imagine	 when 	 ever 	 	you	meet	any	other	person	,	any	time	you	meet	a	person	,	your	 habitu 	 al 	 	,	 instinct 	 ive 	 	first	thought	is	,	``	i	want	you	to	be	happy	.
i	want	you	to	be	happy	.	``
imagine	you	can	do	that	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	habit	,	 th 	 is 	 	mental	habit	,	 change 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	at	work	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	good	will	is	 un 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	by	other	people	,	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	trust	,	and	trust	 create 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	good	 work 	 ing 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 create 	 s 	 	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	in	the	 work 	 place 	 	.
 some 	 day 	 	,	we	hope	to	open	-	source	``	search	 in 	 side 	 	 your 	 self 	 	``	so	that	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	corporate	world	will	at	 l 	 east 	 	be	able	to	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ference 	 	.
and	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	i	want	to	end	the	same	place	i	 start 	 ed 	 	,	with	happiness	.
i	want	to	quote	 th 	 is 	 	guy	--	the	guy	in	 robe 	 s 	 	,	not	the	other	guy	--	the	dalai	lama	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	want	 other 	 s 	 	to	be	happy	,	practice	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
if	you	want	to	be	happy	,	practice	 compass 	 ion 	 	.	``
i	found	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	true	,	both	on	the	individual	level	and	at	a	corporate	level	.
and	i	hope	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	will	be	both	 f 	 un 	 	and	 profit 	 able 	 	for	you	too	.
thank	you	.
