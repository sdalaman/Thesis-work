 every 	 one 	 	's	familiar	with	cancer	,	but	we	do	n't	 normal 	 ly 	 	think	of	cancer	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	disease	.
the	tasmanian	devil	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	us	that	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	cancer	be	a	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	disease	,	but	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	threaten	an	entire	species	with	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.
so	first	of	all	,	what	is	a	tasmanian	devil	?
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	might	be	familiar	with	taz	,	the	cartoon	character	,	the	one	that	 spin 	 s 	 	around	and	around	and	around	.
but	not	 man 	 y 	 	people	know	that	there	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	a	real	animal	 call 	 ed 	 	the	tasmanian	devil	,	and	it	's	the	world	's	largest	 car 	 ni 	 vor 	 ous 	 	marsupial	.
a	marsupial	is	a	mammal	with	a	 po 	 uch 	 	like	a	kangaroo	.
the	tasmanian	devil	got	 it 	 s 	 	name	from	the	 terrify 	 ing 	 	nocturnal	 s 	 cream 	 	that	it	 make 	 s 	 	.
the	tasmanian	devil	is	 pre 	 domin 	 ant 	 ly 	 	a	 scavenge 	 r 	 	,	and	it	uses	 it 	 s 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 jaw 	 s 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	sharp	 tee 	 th 	 	to	 cho 	 mp 	 	on	the	 bone 	 s 	 	of	 rot 	 ting 	 	dead	 animal 	 s 	 	.
[	the	]	tasmanian	devil	is	found	 on 	 ly 	 	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	tasmania	,	which	is	that	small	 is 	 land 	 	just	to	the	south	of	the	 main 	 land 	 	of	australia	.
and	 de 	 spite 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	ferocious	 appear 	 ance 	 	,	tasmanian	 devil 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 ador 	 able 	 	little	 animal 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	growing	up	in	tasmania	,	it	 al 	 ways 	 	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	when	we	got	a	chance	to	see	a	tasmanian	devil	in	the	wild	.
but	the	tasmanian	devil	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 under 	 going 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	fast	decline	.
and	in	fact	,	there	's	concern	that	the	species	could	go	extinct	in	the	wild	 with 	 in 	 	20	to	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	the	reason	for	that	is	the	emergence	of	a	new	disease	,	a	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	cancer	.
the	story	 begin 	 s 	 	in	1996	when	a	 wild 	 life 	 	 photograph 	 er 	 	took	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	here	of	a	tasmanian	devil	with	a	large	tumor	on	 it 	 s 	 	face	.
at	the	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	thought	to	be	a	one	-	off	.
 animal 	 s 	 	,	just	like	 human 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	get	strange	 tumor 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	we	now	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	 sight 	 ing 	 	of	a	new	disease	,	which	is	now	an	 epi 	 demic 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	through	tasmania	.
the	disease	was	first	 sight 	 ed 	 	in	the	 north 	 east 	 	of	tasmania	in	1996	and	 ha 	 s 	 	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	tasmania	like	a	huge	wave	.
now	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	small	part	of	the	population	,	which	 remain 	 s 	 	 un 	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	disease	 appear 	 s 	 	first	 a 	 s 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	on	the	face	or	 in 	 side 	 	the	mouth	of	 affect 	 ed 	 	tasmanian	 devil 	 s 	 	.
these	 tumor 	 s 	 	 inevit 	 ably 	 	grow	 in 	 to 	 	 large 	 r 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	these	 one 	 s 	 	here	.
and	the	next	image	i	'm	going	to	show	is	 quit 	 e 	 	gruesome	.
but	 inevit 	 ably 	 	,	these	 tumor 	 s 	 	progress	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	enormous	,	 ulcer 	 ating 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	in	my	mind	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	case	of	 th 	 is 	 	disease	that	i	saw	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	i	remember	the	 horr 	 or 	 	of	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	female	devil	with	 th 	 is 	 	huge	 ulcer 	 ating 	 	,	foul	-	 smell 	 ing 	 	tumor	 in 	 side 	 	her	mouth	that	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 crack 	 ed 	 	off	her	entire	lower	jaw	.
she	had	n't	eaten	for	 day 	 s 	 	.
her	 gut 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	with	 parasit 	 ic 	 	 worm 	 s 	 	.
her	body	was	 riddle 	 d 	 	with	 second 	 ary 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	she	was	 feed 	 ing 	 	three	little	baby	tasmanian	 devil 	 s 	 	in	her	 po 	 uch 	 	.
of	course	,	they	 di 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	mother	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	too	young	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mother	.
in	fact	,	in	the	area	where	she	 come 	 s 	 	from	,	more	than	90	percent	of	the	tasmanian	devil	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	disease	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	around	the	world	 we 	 re 	 	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	cancer	,	 th 	 is 	 	 infect 	 ious 	 	cancer	,	that	was	 spread 	 ing 	 	through	the	tasmanian	devil	population	.
and	our	 mind 	 s 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	 cerv 	 ical 	 	cancer	in	women	,	which	is	spread	by	a	virus	,	and	to	the	 aid 	 s 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	,	which	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	a	number	of	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	cancer	.
all	the	evidence	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	devil	cancer	was	spread	by	a	virus	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	we	now	know	--	and	i	'll	tell	you	right	now	--	that	we	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	cancer	is	not	spread	by	a	virus	.
in	fact	,	the	 infect 	 ious 	 	agent	of	disease	in	 th 	 is 	 	cancer	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 al 	 together 	 	more	 s 	 ini 	 ster 	 	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	had	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	of	before	.
but	in	order	for	me	to	explain	what	that	is	,	i	need	to	 s 	 pend 	 	just	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	more	about	cancer	 it 	 self 	 	.
cancer	is	a	disease	that	 affect 	 s 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	around	the	world	every	year	.
one	in	three	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	will	develop	cancer	at	some	stage	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
i	 my 	 self 	 	had	a	tumor	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	my	large	intestine	when	i	was	 on 	 ly 	 	14	.
cancer	 occur 	 s 	 	when	a	single	cell	in	your	body	 acquir 	 es 	 	a	set	of	random	 mutation 	 s 	 	in	 import 	 ant 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	that	cause	that	cell	to	start	to	produce	more	and	more	and	more	copies	of	 it 	 self 	 	.
 paradox 	 ically 	 	,	once	 establish 	 ed 	 	,	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 favor 	 s 	 	the	 continu 	 ed 	 	growth	of	cancer	.
natural	 s 	 election 	 	is	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	the	 fit 	 test 	 	.
and	when	you	have	a	population	of	fast	-	 divid 	 ing 	 	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	,	if	one	of	them	 acquir 	 es 	 	new	 mutation 	 s 	 	,	which	allow	them	to	grow	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 acquir 	 e 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	more	 success 	 fully 	 	,	 invad 	 e 	 	the	body	,	they	'll	be	 select 	 ed 	 	for	by	evolution	.
that	's	why	cancer	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	difficult	disease	to	treat	.
it	 evolve 	 s 	 	.
throw	a	drug	at	it	,	and	resistant	 cell 	 s 	 	will	grow	back	.
an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	fact	is	that	,	 give 	 n 	 	the	right	environment	and	the	right	 nutrient 	 s 	 	,	a	cancer	cell	 ha 	 s 	 	the	potential	to	go	on	growing	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	cancer	is	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	by	living	 in 	 side 	 	our	bodies	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	growth	,	 it 	 s 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	through	our	bodies	and	eating	away	at	our	 tissue 	 s 	 	,	 lead 	 s 	 	to	the	death	of	the	cancer	patient	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	the	death	of	the	cancer	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	cancer	could	be	thought	of	 a 	 s 	 	a	strange	,	short	-	lived	,	self	-	 destruct 	 ive 	 	life	form	--	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	dead	end	.
but	that	is	where	the	tasmanian	devil	cancer	 ha 	 s 	 	 acquir 	 ed 	 	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 adapt 	 ation 	 	.
and	the	answer	came	from	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	tasmanian	devil	cancer	's	dna	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	work	from	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	but	i	'm	going	to	explain	it	through	a	 confirm 	 atory 	 	experiment	that	i	did	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	next	slide	is	going	to	be	gruesome	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	jonas	.
he	's	a	tasmanian	devil	that	we	found	with	a	large	tumor	on	his	face	.
and	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 genetic 	 ist 	 	,	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	dna	and	 mutation 	 s 	 	.
so	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	collect	some	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	from	jonas	'	tumor	and	 al 	 so 	 	some	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	from	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	his	body	.
i	took	these	back	to	the	lab	.
i	 extra 	 cted 	 	dna	from	them	.
and	when	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	sequence	of	the	dna	,	and	 compar 	 ed 	 	the	sequence	of	jonas	'	tumor	to	that	of	the	rest	of	his	body	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	they	had	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	genetic	profile	.
in	fact	,	jonas	and	his	tumor	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 s 	 	different	from	each	other	 a 	 s 	 	you	and	the	person	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	you	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	told	us	was	that	jonas	'	tumor	did	not	arise	from	 cell 	 s 	 	of	his	own	body	.
in	fact	,	more	genetic	 pro 	 filing 	 	told	us	that	 th 	 is 	 	tumor	in	jonas	 actual 	 ly 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	first	 a 	 rose 	 	from	the	 cell 	 s 	 	of	a	female	tasmanian	devil	--	and	jonas	was	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	male	.
so	how	come	a	tumor	that	 a 	 rose 	 	from	the	 cell 	 s 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	individual	is	growing	on	jonas	'	face	?
well	the	next	 break 	 through 	 	came	from	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	tasmanian	devil	 cancer 	 s 	 	from	all	around	tasmania	.
we	found	that	all	of	these	 cancer 	 s 	 	 share 	 d 	 	the	same	dna	.
think	about	that	for	a	minute	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	all	of	these	 cancer 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	the	same	cancer	that	 a 	 rose 	 	once	from	one	individual	devil	,	that	have	broken	free	of	that	first	devil	's	body	and	spread	through	the	entire	tasmanian	devil	population	.
but	how	can	a	cancer	spread	in	a	population	?
well	the	final	piece	of	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	came	when	we	remember	how	 devil 	 s 	 	 behav 	 e 	 	when	they	meet	each	other	in	the	wild	.
they	tend	to	bite	each	other	,	often	 quit 	 e 	 	 ferocious 	 ly 	 	and	 usual 	 ly 	 	on	the	face	.
we	think	that	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	off	the	tumor	,	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	saliva	.
when	the	devil	 bite 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	devil	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 physical 	 ly 	 	 implant 	 s 	 	living	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	next	devil	,	so	the	tumor	 continu 	 es 	 	to	grow	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	tasmanian	devil	cancer	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	ultimate	cancer	.
it	's	not	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	by	living	 with 	 in 	 	the	body	that	 g 	 ave 	 	rise	to	it	.
it	 spread 	 s 	 	through	the	population	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 mutation 	 s 	 	that	allow	it	to	 evad 	 e 	 	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	,	and	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	cancer	that	we	know	of	that	's	 threaten 	 ing 	 	an	entire	species	with	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.
but	if	 th 	 is 	 	can	happen	in	tasmanian	 devil 	 s 	 	,	why	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	other	 animal 	 s 	 	or	even	 human 	 s 	 	?
well	the	answer	is	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	kimbo	.
he	's	a	dog	that	 belong 	 s 	 	to	a	family	in	mombasa	in	kenya	.
last	year	,	his	owner	 notice 	 d 	 	some	blood	 trick 	 ling 	 	from	his	genital	region	.
she	took	him	to	the	vet	and	the	vet	 discover 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 disgust 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	you	're	 squeam 	 ish 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	look	away	now	.
he	 discover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	a	huge	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	tumor	at	the	base	of	kimbo	's	penis	.
the	vet	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 trans 	 mis 	 s 	 ible 	 	 vene 	 real 	 	tumor	,	a	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	cancer	that	 affect 	 s 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	.
and	just	 a 	 s 	 	the	tasmanian	devil	cancer	is	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	through	the	spread	of	living	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	,	so	is	 th 	 is 	 	dog	cancer	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	dog	cancer	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	spread	all	around	the	world	.
and	in	fact	,	these	same	 cell 	 s 	 	that	are	 affect 	 ing 	 	kimbo	here	are	 al 	 so 	 	found	 affect 	 ing 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	in	new	york	city	,	in	mountain	 village 	 s 	 	in	the	himalayas	and	in	outback	australia	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cancer	might	be	 ver 	 y 	 	old	.
in	fact	,	genetic	 pro 	 filing 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	that	it	may	be	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	cancer	may	have	first	 arise 	 n 	 	from	the	 cell 	 s 	 	of	a	wolf	that	lived	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	cancer	is	 remark 	 able 	 	.
it	's	the	 old 	 est 	 	 mammal 	 ian 	 	-	derived	life	form	that	we	know	of	.
it	's	a	living	 re 	 lic 	 	of	the	 di 	 stant 	 	past	.
so	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	can	happen	in	 animal 	 s 	 	.
could	 cancer 	 s 	 	be	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	between	people	?
well	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	question	which	 fascinate 	 d 	 	chester	southam	,	a	cancer	doctor	in	the	1950s	.
ad	he	 decide 	 d 	 	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	test	by	 actual 	 ly 	 	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	 inocul 	 ating 	 	people	with	cancer	from	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	of	dr.	southam	in	1957	 inject 	 ing 	 	cancer	 in 	 to 	 	a	volunteer	,	who	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	was	an	 in 	 mate 	 	in	ohio	state	penitentiary	.
most	of	the	people	that	dr.	southam	 inject 	 ed 	 	did	not	go	on	to	develop	cancer	from	the	 inject 	 ed 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
but	a	small	number	of	them	did	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	ill	--	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 system 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	,	 ethic 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	 a 	 side 	 	,	is	that	...
it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	rare	for	 cancer 	 s 	 	to	be	 transfer 	 red 	 	between	people	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	under	some	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	it	can	happen	.
and	i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 onco 	 logists 	 	and	 epidemio 	 logists 	 	should	be	aware	of	in	the	future	.
so	just	 final 	 ly 	 	,	cancer	is	an	 inevit 	 able 	 	 out 	 come 	 	of	the	ability	of	our	 cell 	 s 	 	to	divide	and	to	adapt	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	.
but	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	mean	that	we	should	give	up	hope	in	the	fight	against	cancer	.
in	fact	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	more	knowledge	of	the	complex	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 process 	 es 	 	that	drive	cancer	's	growth	,	we	can	defeat	cancer	.
my	personal	aim	is	to	defeat	the	tasmanian	devil	cancer	.
let	's	prevent	the	tasmanian	devil	from	 be 	 ing 	 	the	first	animal	to	go	extinct	from	cancer	.
thank	you	.
