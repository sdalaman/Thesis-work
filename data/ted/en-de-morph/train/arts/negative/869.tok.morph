do	you	worry	about	what	is	going	to	kill	you	?
heart	disease	,	cancer	,	a	car	accident	?
most	of	us	worry	about	 thing 	 s 	 	we	ca	n't	control	,	like	war	,	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	the	tragic	 earth 	 quake 	 	that	just	 occur 	 red 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	.
but	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 threaten 	 s 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	?
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	professor	vaclav	smil	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	sudden	 disaster 	 s 	 	large	 en 	 ough 	 	to	change	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
he	 call 	 ed 	 	these	,	``	 massive 	 ly 	 	fatal	 dis 	 continu 	 ities 	 	,	``	meaning	that	they	could	kill	up	to	100	million	people	in	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 odd 	 s 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	world	war	,	of	a	massive	 volcan 	 ic 	 	 erupt 	 ion 	 	,	even	of	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	hitting	the	earth	.
but	he	 place 	 d 	 	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	of	one	 s 	 uch 	 	event	above	all	 other 	 s 	 	at	close	to	100	percent	,	and	that	is	a	severe	flu	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
now	,	you	might	think	of	flu	 a 	 s 	 	just	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	cold	,	but	it	can	be	a	death	sentence	.
every	year	,	36,000	people	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	die	of	 season 	 al 	 	flu	.
in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	the	data	is	much	 sketch 	 ier 	 	but	the	death	toll	is	 al 	 most 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	 high 	 er 	 	.
you	know	,	the	problem	is	if	 th 	 is 	 	virus	 occasion 	 ally 	 	 mut 	 ates 	 	so	 dramat 	 ically 	 	,	it	 essential 	 ly 	 	is	a	new	virus	and	then	we	get	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
in	1918	,	a	new	virus	 appear 	 ed 	 	that	 kill 	 ed 	 	some	50	to	100	million	people	.
it	spread	like	 wild 	 fire 	 	and	some	 di 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
are	we	 safe 	 r 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?
well	,	we	seem	to	have	 dodge 	 d 	 	the	 dead 	 ly 	 	 pan 	 demic 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	that	most	of	us	 fear 	 ed 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	threat	could	 re 	 appear 	 	at	any	time	.
the	good	news	is	that	we	're	at	a	moment	in	time	when	science	,	technology	,	 global 	 ization 	 	is	 converg 	 ing 	 	to	create	an	unprecedented	 possibil 	 ity 	 	:	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	make	 histo 	 ry 	 	by	 prevent 	 ing 	 	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	that	still	account	for	one	-	fifth	of	all	 death 	 s 	 	and	 count 	 less 	 	 mis 	 ery 	 	on	earth	.
we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 prevent 	 ing 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 death 	 s 	 	with	 exist 	 ing 	 	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	and	if	we	get	these	to	more	people	,	we	can	 certain 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	more	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	with	new	or	better	 vaccin 	 es 	 	for	malaria	,	tb	,	hiv	,	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	,	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	,	flu	,	we	could	end	 suffer 	 ing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	on	the	earth	since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	time	.
so	,	i	'm	here	to	 trump 	 et 	 	 vaccin 	 es 	 	for	you	.
but	first	,	i	have	to	explain	why	they	're	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	the	power	of	them	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	like	a	whisper	.
when	they	work	,	they	can	make	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	but	after	a	while	you	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	hear	them	.
now	,	some	of	us	are	old	 en 	 ough 	 	to	have	a	small	,	 circul 	 ar 	 	scar	on	our	 arm 	 s 	 	from	an	 inocul 	 ation 	 	we	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	children	.
but	when	was	the	last	time	you	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 small 	 pox 	 	,	a	disease	that	 kill 	 ed 	 	half	a	billion	people	last	century	and	no	 long 	 er 	 	is	with	us	?
or	 poli 	 o 	 	?	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	remember	the	iron	lung	?
we	do	n't	see	 scene 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 any 	 more 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 vaccin 	 es 	 	.
now	,	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	30	-	odd	 disease 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 vaccin 	 es 	 	now	,	but	we	're	still	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	 thing 	 s 	 	like	hiv	and	flu	.
why	is	that	?
well	,	here	's	the	 dirt 	 y 	 	little	secret	.
 un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	n't	had	to	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	.
we	 k 	 new 	 	they	 work 	 ed 	 	through	old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	trial	and	error	.
you	took	a	pathogen	,	you	 modifi 	 ed 	 	it	,	you	 inject 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	person	or	an	animal	and	you	saw	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	well	for	most	 pathogen 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 what 	 	well	for	 craft 	 y 	 	 bug 	 s 	 	like	flu	,	but	not	at	all	for	hiv	,	for	which	 human 	 s 	 	have	no	natural	 immun 	 ity 	 	.
so	let	's	explore	how	 vaccin 	 es 	 	work	.
they	 bas 	 ically 	 	create	a	cache	of	 weapon 	 s 	 	for	your	 immun 	 e 	 	system	which	you	can	deploy	when	 need 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	when	you	get	a	viral	 infect 	 ion 	 	,	what	 normal 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	is	it	 take 	 s 	 	 day 	 s 	 	or	 week 	 s 	 	for	your	body	to	fight	back	at	full	strength	,	and	that	might	be	too	late	.
when	you	're	pre	-	 immun 	 ized 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	have	 force 	 s 	 	in	your	body	pre	-	trained	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	and	defeat	specific	 foe 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	how	 vaccin 	 es 	 	work	.
now	,	let	's	take	a	look	at	a	video	that	we	're	 debut 	 ing 	 	at	ted	,	for	the	first	time	,	on	how	an	effective	hiv	 vaccin 	 e 	 	might	work	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 train 	 s 	 	the	body	in	advance	how	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	and	 neutral 	 ize 	 	a	specific	 invad 	 er 	 	.
after	hiv	 penetrate 	 s 	 	the	body	's	 mucosa 	 l 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	,	it	 infect 	 s 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	to	replicate	.
the	 invad 	 er 	 	 draw 	 s 	 	the	attention	of	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	's	front	-	line	 troop 	 s 	 	.
 den 	 dritic 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	or	 macro 	 phage 	 s 	 	,	capture	the	virus	and	 dis 	 play 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 memor 	 y 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	generated	by	the	hiv	 vaccin 	 e 	 	are	 activate 	 d 	 	when	they	learn	hiv	is	present	from	the	front	-	line	 troop 	 s 	 	.
these	 memor 	 y 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	deploy	the	exact	 weapon 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	.
 memor 	 y 	 	b	 cell 	 s 	 	turn	 in 	 to 	 	plasma	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	produce	wave	after	wave	of	the	specific	 anti 	 bodies 	 	that	latch	onto	hiv	to	prevent	it	from	 infect 	 ing 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	while	 s 	 quad 	 ron 	 s 	 	of	killer	t	 cell 	 s 	 	seek	out	and	destroy	 cell 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	hiv	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
the	virus	is	 defeat 	 ed 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	these	 respons 	 es 	 	would	have	taken	more	than	a	week	.
by	that	time	,	the	battle	against	hiv	would	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	lost	.
seth	berkley	:	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	video	,	is	n't	it	?
the	 anti 	 bodies 	 	you	just	saw	in	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	in	action	,	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	make	most	 vaccin 	 es 	 	work	.
so	the	real	question	then	is	:	how	do	we	ensure	that	your	body	 make 	 s 	 	the	exact	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	protect	against	flu	and	hiv	?
the	principal	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	both	of	these	viruses	is	that	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	changing	.
so	let	's	take	a	look	at	the	flu	virus	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 render 	 ing 	 	of	the	flu	virus	,	these	different	 color 	 ed 	 	 spike 	 s 	 	are	what	it	uses	to	infect	you	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	what	the	 anti 	 bodies 	 	use	is	a	handle	to	 essential 	 ly 	 	grab	and	 neutral 	 ize 	 	the	virus	.
when	these	 mut 	 ate 	 	,	they	change	 the 	 ir 	 	shape	,	and	the	 anti 	 bodies 	 	do	n't	know	what	they	're	looking	at	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	that	's	why	every	year	you	can	catch	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	 s 	 train 	 	of	flu	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	why	in	the	spring	,	we	have	to	make	a	best	guess	at	which	three	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	are	going	to	prevail	the	next	year	,	put	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	single	 vaccin 	 e 	 	and	rush	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 to 	 	production	for	the	fall	.
even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	the	most	common	influenza	--	influenza	a	--	 al 	 so 	 	 infect 	 s 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	that	live	in	close	 proxim 	 ity 	 	to	 human 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	 re 	 combine 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	wild	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	carry	all	known	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	influenza	.
so	,	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	:	in	2003	,	we	had	an	h	5n1	virus	that	 jump 	 ed 	 	from	 bird 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 human 	 s 	 	in	a	few	 isolate 	 d 	 	 case 	 s 	 	with	an	 ap 	 parent 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rate	of	70	percent	.
now	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	that	 part 	 icular 	 	virus	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	at	the	time	,	did	not	transmit	from	person	to	person	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	's	h	1n1	threat	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	human	,	 av 	 ian 	 	,	 s 	 wine 	 	 mix 	 ture 	 	that	 a 	 rose 	 	in	mexico	.
it	was	 eas 	 ily 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	,	but	,	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	mild	.
and	so	,	in	a	sense	,	our	luck	is	 hold 	 ing 	 	out	,	but	you	know	,	 an 	 other 	 	wild	bird	could	fly	over	at	 any 	 time 	 	.
now	let	's	take	a	look	at	hiv	.
 a 	 s 	 	 vari 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	flu	is	,	hiv	 make 	 s 	 	flu	look	like	the	rock	of	gibraltar	.
the	virus	that	 cause 	 s 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	is	the	 trick 	 iest 	 	pathogen	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	ever	 confront 	 ed 	 	.
it	 mut 	 ates 	 	 fur 	 iously 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 decoy 	 s 	 	to	 evad 	 e 	 	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	,	it	 attack 	 s 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	that	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	fight	it	and	it	 quick 	 ly 	 	 hide 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	your	genome	.
here	's	a	slide	looking	at	the	genetic	 vari 	 ation 	 	of	flu	and	 compar 	 ing 	 	that	to	hiv	,	a	much	 wild 	 er 	 	target	.
in	the	video	a	moment	ago	,	you	saw	 fleet 	 s 	 	of	new	viruses	 launch 	 ing 	 	from	 infect 	 ed 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
now	 real 	 ize 	 	that	in	a	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	person	,	there	are	 million 	 s 	 	of	these	 ship 	 s 	 	;	each	one	is	just	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	.
 find 	 ing 	 	a	weapon	that	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	and	 sink 	 s 	 	all	of	them	 make 	 s 	 	the	job	that	much	 hard 	 er 	 	.
now	,	in	the	27	 year 	 s 	 	since	hiv	was	identified	 a 	 s 	 	the	cause	of	 aid 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	more	 drug 	 s 	 	to	treat	hiv	than	all	other	viruses	put	together	.
these	 drug 	 s 	 	are	n't	 cure 	 s 	 	,	but	they	represent	a	huge	triumph	of	science	 be 	 cause 	 	they	take	away	the	 autom 	 atic 	 	death	sentence	from	a	 diagnos 	 is 	 	of	hiv	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	can	access	them	.
the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	effort	 th 	 ough 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
large	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 move 	 d 	 	away	from	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	thought	the	science	was	so	difficult	and	 vaccin 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	poor	business	.
 man 	 y 	 	thought	that	it	was	just	 im 	 possible 	 	to	make	an	 aid 	 s 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	but	 to 	 day 	 	,	evidence	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 other 	 wise 	 	.
in	september	,	we	had	surprising	but	 excit 	 ing 	 	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	from	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	that	took	place	in	thailand	.
for	the	first	time	,	we	saw	an	 aid 	 s 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	work	in	 human 	 s 	 	--	albeit	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 modest 	 ly 	 	--	and	that	 part 	 icular 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	was	made	 al 	 most 	 	a	decade	ago	.
 new 	 er 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	and	early	 test 	 ing 	 	now	show	even	 great 	 er 	 	promise	in	the	best	of	our	animal	 model 	 s 	 	.
but	in	the	past	few	 month 	 s 	 	,	 research 	 ers 	 	have	 al 	 so 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	new	 broad 	 ly 	 	 neutral 	 izing 	 	 anti 	 bodies 	 	from	the	blood	of	an	hiv	 infect 	 ed 	 	individual	.
now	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
we	saw	 ear 	 lier 	 	that	hiv	is	 high 	 ly 	 	 vari 	 able 	 	,	that	a	broad	 neutral 	 izing 	 	 anti 	 body 	 	 latch 	 es 	 	on	and	 dis 	 able 	 s 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	of	the	virus	.
if	you	take	these	and	you	put	them	in	the	best	of	our	monkey	 model 	 s 	 	,	they	provide	full	 protect 	 ion 	 	from	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	these	 research 	 ers 	 	found	a	new	 s 	 ite 	 	on	hiv	where	the	 anti 	 bodies 	 	can	grab	onto	,	and	what	's	so	special	about	 th 	 is 	 	spot	is	that	it	 change 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	 a 	 s 	 	the	virus	 mut 	 ates 	 	.
it	's	like	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	virus	 change 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	it	's	still	 wear 	 ing 	 	the	same	 sock 	 s 	 	,	and	now	our	job	is	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	get	the	body	to	 re 	 ally 	 	hate	 t 	 hose 	 	 sock 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	've	got	is	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
the	thai	 result 	 s 	 	tell	us	we	can	make	an	 aid 	 s 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	and	the	 anti 	 body 	 	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	tell	us	how	we	might	do	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	from	an	 anti 	 body 	 	to	create	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 candid 	 ate 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	before	in	 vaccin 	 e 	 	research	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	retro	-	 vaccin 	 ology 	 	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	extend	way	beyond	that	of	just	hiv	.
so	think	of	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
we	've	got	these	new	 anti 	 bodies 	 	we	've	identified	,	and	we	know	that	they	latch	onto	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	of	the	virus	.
we	know	that	they	have	to	latch	onto	a	specific	part	,	so	if	we	can	figure	out	the	precise	structure	of	that	part	,	present	that	through	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	what	we	hope	is	we	can	prompt	your	 immun 	 e 	 	system	to	make	these	 match 	 ing 	 	 anti 	 bodies 	 	.
and	that	would	create	a	universal	hiv	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
now	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	than	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	structure	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	blue	 anti 	 body 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	yellow	 bind 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	these	three	-	dimensional	 structure 	 s 	 	are	much	 hard 	 er 	 	to	work	on	.
and	if	you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	 idea 	 s 	 	to	help	us	solve	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	'd	love	to	hear	about	it	.
but	,	you	know	,	the	research	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	from	hiv	now	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	with	 innov 	 ation 	 	with	other	 disease 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	a	 bio 	 technology 	 	company	 ha 	 s 	 	now	found	 broad 	 ly 	 	 neutral 	 izing 	 	 anti 	 bodies 	 	to	influenza	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	a	new	 anti 	 body 	 	target	on	the	flu	virus	.
they	're	 current 	 ly 	 	making	a	 cock 	 tail 	 	--	an	 anti 	 body 	 	 cock 	 tail 	 	--	that	can	be	used	to	treat	severe	,	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 case 	 s 	 	of	flu	.
in	the	 long 	 er 	 	term	,	what	they	can	do	is	use	these	 tool 	 s 	 	of	retro	-	 vaccin 	 ology 	 	to	make	a	 prevent 	 ive 	 	flu	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
now	,	retro	-	 vaccin 	 ology 	 	is	just	one	 techni 	 que 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	ambit	of	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	rational	 vaccin 	 e 	 	design	.
let	me	give	you	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	before	the	h	and	n	 spike 	 s 	 	on	the	surface	of	the	flu	virus	.
notice	these	other	,	 small 	 er 	 	 pro 	 tub 	 er 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 large 	 ly 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	from	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
now	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	these	 spot 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	do	n't	change	much	when	the	virus	 mut 	 ates 	 	.
if	you	can	 c 	 ripple 	 	these	with	specific	 anti 	 bodies 	 	,	you	could	 c 	 ripple 	 	all	 version 	 s 	 	of	the	flu	.
so	far	,	animal	 test 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ate 	 	that	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	could	prevent	severe	disease	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	might	get	a	mild	case	.
so	if	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	a	universal	flu	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	one	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	change	every	year	and	would	 re 	 move 	 	the	threat	of	death	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	could	think	of	flu	,	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	just	a	bad	cold	.
of	course	,	the	best	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 imagin 	 able 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	we	get	it	to	 every 	 one 	 	who	 need 	 s 	 	it	.
so	to	do	that	,	we	have	to	combine	smart	 vaccin 	 e 	 	design	with	smart	production	 method 	 s 	 	and	,	of	course	,	smart	 deliver 	 y 	 	 method 	 s 	 	.
so	i	want	you	to	think	back	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
in	june	,	the	world	health	 organ 	 ization 	 	 declare 	 d 	 	the	first	global	flu	 pan 	 demic 	 	in	41	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	u.s.	government	 promise 	 d 	 	150	million	 dose 	 s 	 	of	 vaccin 	 e 	 	by	october	15th	for	the	flu	peak	.
 vaccin 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 promise 	 d 	 	to	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	and	 flow 	 ed 	 	to	 accele 	 rating 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	we	first	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	make	flu	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	how	to	produce	them	,	in	the	early	1940s	.
it	was	a	 s 	 low 	 	,	 cum 	 ber 	 some 	 	process	that	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	living	chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	.
viruses	 on 	 ly 	 	grow	in	living	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	so	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	,	for	flu	,	chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
for	most	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	,	you	could	get	one	to	two	 dose 	 s 	 	of	 vaccin 	 e 	 	per	egg	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	for	us	,	we	live	in	an	era	of	 breath 	 taking 	 	 bio 	 medical 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	get	our	flu	 vaccin 	 es 	 	from	...
chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
the	system	is	 reli 	 able 	 	but	the	problem	is	you	never	know	how	well	a	 s 	 train 	 	is	going	to	grow	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	's	 s 	 wine 	 	flu	 s 	 train 	 	grew	 ver 	 y 	 	 poor 	 ly 	 	in	early	production	:	 bas 	 ically 	 	.6	 dose 	 s 	 	per	egg	.
so	,	here	's	an	 alarm 	 ing 	 	thought	.
what	if	that	wild	bird	flies	by	 aga 	 in 	 	?
you	could	see	an	 av 	 ian 	 	 s 	 train 	 	that	would	infect	the	 po 	 ul 	 try 	 	 flock 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	would	have	no	 egg 	 s 	 	for	our	 vaccin 	 es 	 	.
so	,	dan	[	 barb 	 er 	 	]	,	if	you	want	 billion 	 s 	 	of	chicken	 pel 	 lets 	 	for	your	fish	farm	,	i	know	where	to	get	them	.
so	right	now	,	the	world	can	produce	about	350	million	 dose 	 s 	 	of	flu	 vaccin 	 e 	 	for	the	three	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	up	that	to	about	1.2	billion	 dose 	 s 	 	if	we	want	to	target	a	single	 vari 	 ant 	 	like	 s 	 wine 	 	flu	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 assum 	 es 	 	that	our	 factor 	 ies 	 	are	humming	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	2004	,	the	u.s.	supply	was	cut	in	half	by	 contami 	 nation 	 	at	one	single	plant	.
and	the	process	still	 take 	 s 	 	more	than	half	a	year	.
so	are	we	better	prepared	than	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	1918	?
well	,	with	the	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	now	,	i	hope	we	can	say	 definitive 	 ly 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
imagine	we	could	produce	 en 	 ough 	 	flu	 vaccin 	 e 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	entire	world	for	less	than	half	of	what	we	're	 current 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	now	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
with	a	range	of	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	we	could	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	a	company	i	'm	 engag 	 ed 	 	with	 ha 	 s 	 	found	a	specific	piece	of	the	h	spike	of	flu	that	 spark 	 s 	 	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
if	you	lop	 th 	 is 	 	off	and	attach	it	to	the	tail	of	a	different	 bacter 	 ium 	 	,	which	 create 	 s 	 	a	 vigor 	 ous 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	they	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	flu	 fight 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	is	so	small	it	can	be	grown	in	a	common	bacteria	,	e.	coli	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	bacteria	 re 	 produce 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	like	making	yogurt	--	and	so	we	could	produce	 en 	 ough 	 	 s 	 wine 	 	origin	flu	for	the	entire	world	in	a	few	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	in	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	,	with	no	 egg 	 s 	 	,	for	a	fraction	of	the	cost	of	current	 method 	 s 	 	.
so	here	's	a	 compar 	 ison 	 	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	these	new	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
and	,	 a 	 side 	 	from	the	 radical 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	production	and	huge	cost	 saving 	 s 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	e.	coli	method	i	just	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	--	look	at	the	time	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	 live 	 s 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	 most 	 ly 	 	left	out	of	the	current	 respons 	 e 	 	,	 s 	 ees 	 	the	potential	of	these	alternate	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	they	're	 leapfrog 	 ging 	 	the	west	.
india	,	mexico	and	 other 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	making	 experiment 	 al 	 	flu	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	and	they	may	be	the	first	place	we	see	these	 vaccin 	 es 	 	in	use	.
 be 	 cause 	 	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	so	efficient	and	 relat 	 ively 	 	cheap	,	 billion 	 s 	 	of	people	can	have	access	to	 life 	 saving 	 	 vaccin 	 es 	 	if	we	can	figure	out	how	to	deliver	them	.
now	think	of	where	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	us	.
new	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	appear	or	 re 	 appear 	 	every	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
some	day	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	soon	,	we	'll	have	a	virus	that	is	going	to	threaten	all	of	us	.
will	we	be	quick	 en 	 ough 	 	to	react	before	 million 	 s 	 	die	?
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	year	's	flu	was	 relat 	 ively 	 	mild	.
i	say	,	``	 luck 	 ily 	 	``	in	part	 be 	 cause 	 	 virtual 	 ly 	 	no	one	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	was	 vaccin 	 ated 	 	.
so	if	we	have	the	 politic 	 al 	 	and	financial	 fore 	 sight 	 	to	sustain	our	 invest 	 ments 	 	,	we	will	master	these	and	new	 tool 	 s 	 	of	 vaccin 	 ology 	 	,	and	with	these	 tool 	 s 	 	we	can	produce	 en 	 ough 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	at	low	cost	and	ensure	 health 	 y 	 	productive	 live 	 s 	 	.
no	 long 	 er 	 	must	flu	have	to	kill	half	a	million	people	a	year	.
no	 long 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	need	to	kill	two	million	a	year	.
no	 long 	 er 	 	do	the	poor	and	 vulner 	 able 	 	need	to	be	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	or	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 any 	 body 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	vaclav	smil	's	``	 massive 	 ly 	 	fatal	 dis 	 continu 	 ity 	 	``	of	life	,	we	can	ensure	the	 continu 	 ity 	 	of	life	.
what	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	are	these	new	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	and	we	can	make	it	happen	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	thank	you	.
thank	you	.
so	,	the	science	is	changing	.
in	your	mind	,	seth	--	i	mean	,	you	must	dream	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	what	is	the	kind	of	time	scale	on	,	let	's	start	with	hiv	,	for	a	game	-	changing	 vaccin 	 e 	 	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	out	there	and	 us 	 able 	 	?
sb	:	the	game	change	can	come	at	any	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	problem	we	have	now	is	we	've	 show 	 n 	 	we	can	get	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	to	work	in	 human 	 s 	 	;	we	just	need	a	better	one	.
and	with	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 anti 	 bodies 	 	,	we	know	 human 	 s 	 	can	make	them	.
so	,	if	we	can	figure	out	how	to	do	that	,	then	we	have	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	there	 al 	 ready 	 	is	some	evidence	that	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	crack	that	problem	.
so	,	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	full	speed	 a 	 head 	 	.
ca	:	in	your	gut	,	do	you	think	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	be	at	 l 	 east 	 	 an 	 other 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	?
sb	:	you	know	,	 every 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	every	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	i	hate	to	put	a	 time 	 line 	 	on	scientific	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	but	the	 invest 	 ments 	 	that	have	 occur 	 red 	 	are	now	 pay 	 ing 	 	 divid 	 end 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	and	that	's	the	same	with	universal	flu	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	the	same	kind	of	thing	?
sb	:	i	think	flu	is	different	.	i	think	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	flu	is	we	've	got	a	bunch	--	i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	a	bunch	of	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	and	 use 	 ful 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	are	ready	to	go	now	.
they	look	good	.	the	problem	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	,	what	we	did	is	we	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	 tradition 	 al 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	can	use	 adjuv 	 ants 	 	,	which	are	 chemical 	 s 	 	you	mix	.
that	's	what	europe	is	 do 	 ing 	 	,	so	we	could	have	 di 	 lute 	 d 	 	out	our	supply	of	flu	and	made	more	 avail 	 able 	 	,	but	,	going	back	to	what	michael	 spect 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	anti	-	 vaccin 	 e 	 	crowd	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	that	to	happen	.
ca	:	and	malaria	's	even	further	 be 	 hind 	 	?
sb	:	no	,	malaria	,	there	is	a	 candid 	 ate 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	in	an	 ear 	 lier 	 	trial	and	is	 current 	 ly 	 	in	phase	three	 trial 	 s 	 	now	.
it	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	n't	the	perfect	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	moving	 a 	 long 	 	.
ca	:	seth	,	most	of	us	do	work	where	every	month	,	we	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	;	we	get	that	kind	of	 grat 	 ification 	 	.
you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 lav 	 ing 	 	away	at	 th 	 is 	 	for	more	than	a	decade	,	and	i	 salut 	 e 	 	you	and	your	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	for	what	you	do	.
the	world	 need 	 s 	 	people	like	you	.	thank	you	.
sb	:	thank	you	.
