 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	for	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	not	used	to	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	i	 usual 	 ly 	 	stand	on	the	other	side	of	the	light	,	and	now	i	'm	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	pressure	i	put	other	people	 in 	 to 	 	.	and	it	's	hard	...
the	previous	speaker	 ha 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 back 	 ground 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	the	impulse	 be 	 hind 	 	my	work	and	what	 drive 	 s 	 	me	,	and	my	sense	of	loss	,	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	answer	to	the	big	 question 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	,	for	me	,	i	mean	,	coming	here	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 feel 	 s 	 	like	--	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 sculpt 	 or 	 	that	i	like	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	giacometti	,	who	after	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	living	in	france	--	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	and	 work 	 ing 	 	--	he	 return 	 ed 	 	home	and	he	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	what	did	you	produce	?

and	he	sort	of	,	he	 show 	 ed 	 	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	 figur 	 ine 	 s 	 	.
and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	what	you	 s 	 pent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	?
and	we	 expect 	 ed 	 	huge	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	!	``
but	what	 s 	 truck 	 	me	is	the	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	in	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 piece 	 s 	 	was	the	 culmin 	 ation 	 	of	a	man	's	life	,	search	,	thought	,	 every 	 thing 	 	--	just	in	a	 reduc 	 ed 	 	,	small	version	.
in	a	way	,	i	feel	like	that	.

newton	aduaka	:	thank	you	.	the	first	clip	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	 total 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	capture	what	cinema	is	for	me	,	and	where	i	'm	coming	from	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	cinema	.
the	first	piece	was	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	there	's	a	young	woman	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	nigeria	,	that	she	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	she	'll	be	happy	there	.
these	are	the	 sentiment 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 one 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	away	from	home	.
and	that	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	went	through	,	you	know	,	and	i	'm	still	going	through	.
i	've	not	 be 	 en 	 	home	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	,	for	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	away	20	 year 	 s 	 	in	total	.
and	so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	--	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	how	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	made	in	1997	,	which	is	the	time	of	abacha	--	the	 militar 	 y 	 	 dictator 	 ship 	 	,	the	worst	part	of	nigerian	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	post	-	colonial	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
so	,	for	 th 	 is 	 	girl	to	have	these	 dream 	 s 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	how	we	preserve	a	sense	of	what	home	is	.
how	--	and	it	's	sort	of	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	romantic	,	but	i	think	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	just	need	 some 	 thing 	 	to	hold	on	to	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	where	you	feel	 alien 	 ated 	 	.
which	 take 	 s 	 	us	to	the	next	piece	,	where	the	young	man	 talk 	 s 	 	about	lack	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	:	living	 a 	 s 	 	a	black	person	in	europe	,	the	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	that	we	all	know	about	,	that	we	all	talk	about	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	my	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	me	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	time	of	 multi 	 cultural 	 ism 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	,	and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 buzz 	 word 	 	--	and	it	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 multi 	 cultural 	 ism 	 	mean	in	the	real	 live 	 s 	 	of	people	?
and	what	would	a	child	--	what	 do 	 es 	 	a	child	like	jamie	--	the	young	boy	--	think	,	i	mean	,	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	anger	that	's	built	up	 in 	 side 	 	of	him	?
what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	that	?
what	,	of	course	,	 happen 	 s 	 	with	that	is	violence	,	which	we	see	when	we	talk	about	the	 ghetto 	 s 	 	and	we	talk	about	,	you	know	,	south	central	l.a.	and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	,	and	which	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	when	 channel 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 evolve 	 s 	 	and	 manifest 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 riot 	 s 	 	--	like	the	one	in	france	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	where	i	live	,	which	 shock 	 ed 	 	 every 	 body 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	thought	,	``	oh	well	,	france	is	a	liberal	 socie 	 ty 	 	.	``
but	i	lived	in	england	for	18	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	've	lived	in	france	for	about	four	,	and	i	feel	 actual 	 ly 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	back	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	living	in	france	.
and	then	,	the	third	piece	.	the	third	piece	for	me	is	the	question	:	what	is	cinema	to	you	?	what	do	you	do	with	cinema	?
there	's	a	young	director	,	hollywood	director	,	with	his	 friend 	 s 	 	--	fellow	 film 	 makers 	 	--	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	what	cinema	 mean 	 s 	 	.
i	suppose	that	will	take	me	to	my	last	piece	--	what	cinema	 mean 	 s 	 	for	me	.
my	life	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	--	i	 start 	 ed 	 	life	in	1966	,	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	before	the	biafran	,	which	 last 	 ed 	 	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	and	it	was	three	 year 	 s 	 	of	war	.
so	that	whole	thing	,	that	whole	 child 	 hood 	 	 echo 	 es 	 	and	 take 	 s 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	the	next	piece	.

i	met	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	who	 s 	 pent 	 	time	with	them	,	aid	 work 	 ers 	 	,	ngos	,	the	whole	lot	.
but	i	remember	on	the	flight	back	on	my	last	trip	,	i	remember	 break 	 ing 	 	down	in	 tear 	 s 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	if	any	kid	in	the	west	,	in	the	western	world	,	went	through	a	day	of	what	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	have	gone	through	,	they	will	be	in	therapy	for	the	rest	of	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	for	me	,	the	thought	that	we	have	all	these	children	--	it	's	a	generation	,	we	have	a	whole	generation	of	children	--	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	put	through	so	much	 psycho 	 logical 	 	trauma	or	damage	,	and	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	to	live	with	that	.
but	i	'm	just	 say 	 ing 	 	to	factor	that	in	,	factor	that	in	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	great	 advance 	 ment 	 	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	 pronounce 	 ment 	 	of	great	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	my	 think 	 ing 	 	.
eo	:	well	,	we	thank	you	 aga 	 in 	 	for	coming	to	the	ted	stage	.
that	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	moving	piece	.
na	:	thank	you	.
