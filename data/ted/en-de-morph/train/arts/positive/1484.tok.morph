about	75	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	my	 grand 	 father 	 	,	a	young	man	,	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	tent	that	was	 convert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	movie	theater	like	that	,	and	he	fell	 hope 	 lessly 	 	in	love	with	the	woman	he	saw	on	the	silver	screen	:	 non 	 e 	 	other	than	mae	west	,	the	 heart 	 th 	 rob 	 	of	the	'30s	,	and	he	could	never	forget	her	.
in	fact	,	when	he	had	his	daughter	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	name	her	after	mae	west	,	but	can	you	imagine	an	indian	child	name	mae	west	?
the	indian	family	 s 	 aid 	 	,	no	way	!
so	when	my	 t 	 win 	 	brother	kaesava	was	born	,	he	 decide 	 d 	 	to	tinker	with	the	 spell 	 ing 	 	of	keshava	's	name	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	mae	west	can	be	m	-	a	-	e	,	why	ca	n't	keshava	be	k	-	a	-	e	?
so	he	 change 	 d 	 	kaesava	's	 spell 	 ing 	 	.
now	kaesava	had	a	baby	boy	 call 	 ed 	 	rehan	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
he	 decide 	 d 	 	to	spell	,	or	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	 mis 	 spell 	 	raehan	with	an	a	-	e	.
you	know	,	my	 grand 	 father 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	i	was	little	,	but	his	love	for	mae	west	 live 	 s 	 	on	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mis 	 spell 	 ing 	 	in	the	dna	of	his	 pro 	 geny 	 	.
that	for	me	is	 success 	 ful 	 	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	for	me	,	my	wife	and	i	have	our	own	crazy	 leg 	 acy 	 	project	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 it 	 	every	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	 argu 	 e 	 	,	disagree	,	fight	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	up	with	our	 ver 	 y 	 	own	200	-	year	plan	.
our	 friend 	 s 	 	think	we	're	mad	.
our	 parent 	 s 	 	think	we	're	cuckoo	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	we	both	come	from	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	look	up	to	 humil 	 ity 	 	and	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	but	we	both	like	to	live	 large 	 r 	 	than	life	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	a	raja	yogi	:	be	a	 du 	 de 	 	before	you	can	 be 	 come 	 	an	 asc 	 etic 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	me	 be 	 ing 	 	a	rock	star	,	even	if	it	's	in	my	own	house	.
you	know	?
so	when	netra	and	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	to	make	our	first	plan	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 s 	 aid 	 	we	want	the	focus	of	 th 	 is 	 	plan	to	go	way	beyond	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
what	do	we	mean	by	beyond	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	?
well	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	 calcul 	 ated 	 	,	is	at	the	end	of	our	direct	contact	with	the	world	.
there	's	 no 	 body 	 	i	'll	meet	in	my	life	will	ever	live	beyond	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	so	we	thought	that	's	a	perfect	place	where	we	should	 situ 	 ate 	 	our	plan	and	let	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	take	flight	.
you	know	,	i	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	 leg 	 acy 	 	.	what	am	i	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	?	i	'm	an	artist	.
 un 	 til 	 	i	made	a	cartoon	about	9/11	.
it	 caus 	 ed 	 	so	much	trouble	for	me	.
i	was	so	 up 	 set 	 	.
you	know	,	a	cartoon	that	was	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	a	cartoon	of	the	week	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 stay 	 ing 	 	so	much	 long 	 er 	 	.
now	i	'm	in	the	business	of	creating	art	that	will	 definite 	 ly 	 	even	 out 	 live 	 	me	,	and	i	think	about	what	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	through	 t 	 hose 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	the	9/11	cartoon	 up 	 set 	 	me	so	much	that	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	'll	never	cartoon	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	'm	never	going	to	make	any	honest	public	 comment 	 ary 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	of	course	i	 continu 	 ed 	 	creating	 art 	 work 	 	that	was	honest	and	raw	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 for 	 got 	 	about	how	people	 react 	 ed 	 	to	my	work	.
you	know	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 forget 	 ting 	 	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remain	 ideal 	 istic 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	loss	of	 memor 	 y 	 	is	so	 cruci 	 al 	 	for	our	 surviv 	 al 	 	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	my	200	-	year	plan	that	netra	and	i	write	is	what	to	forget	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
you	know	,	we	carry	so	much	 bag 	 g 	 age 	 	,	from	our	 parent 	 s 	 	,	from	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	from	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	--	 fear 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 securities 	 	--	and	our	200	-	year	plan	 re 	 ally 	 	 list 	 s 	 	all	our	 child 	 hood 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	 expir 	 e 	 	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	an	 expir 	 y 	 	date	on	all	our	 child 	 hood 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
the	 lat 	 est 	 	date	i	put	was	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	am	going	to	 expir 	 e 	 	my	fear	of	my	 left 	 ist 	 	,	feminist	mother	-	in	-	law	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	the	date	!
she	's	 watch 	 ing 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	you	know	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	make	 decision 	 s 	 	all	the	time	about	how	i	want	to	remember	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	that	's	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	kind	of	 decision 	 s 	 	i	make	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	 transl 	 ates 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
but	like	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	i	can	do	that	 re 	 ally 	 	well	on	facebook	,	pinterest	,	twitter	,	flickr	,	youtube	.
name	it	,	i	'm	on	it	.
i	've	 start 	 ed 	 	 out 	 sourcing 	 	my	 memor 	 y 	 	to	the	digital	world	,	you	know	?	but	that	 come 	 s 	 	with	a	problem	.
it	's	so	easy	to	think	of	technology	 a 	 s 	 	a	metaphor	for	 memor 	 y 	 	,	but	our	 brain 	 s 	 	are	not	perfect	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	like	technology	.
we	 on 	 ly 	 	remember	what	we	want	to	.	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	do	.
and	i	 ra 	 ther 	 	think	of	our	 brain 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bias 	 ed 	 	 cur 	 ators 	 	of	our	 memor 	 y 	 	,	you	know	?	and	if	technology	is	not	a	metaphor	for	 memor 	 y 	 	,	what	is	it	?
netra	and	i	use	our	technology	 a 	 s 	 	a	tool	in	our	200	-	year	plan	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 cur 	 ate 	 	our	digital	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
that	is	a	picture	of	my	mother	,	and	she	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	got	a	facebook	account	.
you	know	where	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 support 	 ive 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 show 	 s 	 	up	on	my	facebook	page	.
and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 un 	 tag 	 ged 	 	 my 	 self 	 	first	,	then	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	the	phone	.	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mom	,	you	will	never	put	a	picture	of	me	in	a	bikini	ever	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	?	you	look	so	cute	,	 darl 	 ing 	 	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	just	do	n't	understand	.	``
 may 	 be 	 	we	are	among	the	first	generation	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	digital	 cur 	 ating 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	are	the	first	to	even	 active 	 ly 	 	record	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	agree	with	,	you	know	,	 leg 	 acy 	 	or	not	,	we	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	digital	 trace 	 s 	 	all	the	time	.
so	netra	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	use	our	200	-	year	plan	to	 cur 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	digital	 leg 	 acy 	 	,	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	digital	 leg 	 acy 	 	but	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 cur 	 ating 	 	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	my	past	and	future	.
how	,	you	may	ask	?
well	,	when	i	think	of	the	future	,	i	never	see	 my 	 self 	 	moving	forward	in	time	.	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	time	moving	 back 	 ward 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	me	.
i	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 visual 	 ize 	 	my	future	 approach 	 ing 	 	.
i	can	dodge	what	i	do	n't	want	and	pull	in	what	i	want	.
it	's	like	a	video	game	obstacle	course	.	and	i	've	gotten	better	and	better	at	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	even	when	i	make	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	imagine	i	'm	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	it	 al 	 ready 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 one 	 	's	looking	at	it	,	and	i	see	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	from	 the 	 ir 	 	gut	.
are	they	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	from	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	,	or	is	it	just	a	cerebral	thing	?
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 inform 	 s 	 	my	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
even	when	i	do	an	art	show	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	,	what	should	people	walk	away	with	?
i	remember	when	i	was	19	,	i	did	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	my	first	art	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	the	whole	world	to	know	about	it	.
i	did	n't	know	ted	then	,	but	what	i	did	was	i	closed	my	 eye 	 s 	 	tight	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 dream 	 ing 	 	.	i	could	imagine	people	coming	in	,	 dress 	 ed 	 	up	,	looking	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	my	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	all	the	light	,	and	in	my	 visual 	 ization 	 	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	saw	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	actress	 launch 	 ing 	 	my	show	,	giving	 cr 	 ed 	 ibility 	 	to	me	.
and	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	from	my	 visual 	 ization 	 	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	who	was	that	?	i	could	n't	tell	if	it	was	shabana	azmi	or	rekha	,	two	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	indian	 actress 	 es 	 	,	like	the	meryl	streeps	of	india	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	i	wrote	a	letter	to	both	of	them	,	and	shabana	azmi	 re 	 plied 	 	,	and	came	and	 launch 	 ed 	 	my	 ver 	 y 	 	first	show	12	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	what	a	bang	it	 start 	 ed 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	with	!	you	know	,	when	we	think	of	time	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	we	can	 cur 	 ate 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	future	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	past	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	my	family	,	and	that	is	netra	,	my	wife	.
she	's	the	co	-	creator	of	my	200	-	year	plan	.
netra	's	a	high	school	 histo 	 ry 	 	teacher	.	i	love	netra	,	but	i	hate	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
i	keep	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 net 	 s 	 	,	you	live	in	the	past	while	i	'll	create	the	future	,	and	when	i	'm	 d 	 one 	 	,	you	can	 stud 	 y 	 	about	it	.	``
she	 g 	 ave 	 	me	an	 indulge 	 nt 	 	 s 	 mile 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	 punish 	 ment 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	i	'm	 teach 	 ing 	 	a	class	on	indian	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	you	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	it	,	and	i	'm	 grad 	 ing 	 	you	.	``
i	'm	like	,	``	oh	,	god	.	``	i	went	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	and	 s 	 at 	 	in	on	her	class	.	she	 start 	 ed 	 	by	giving	 student 	 s 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	source	 document 	 s 	 	from	india	,	pakistan	,	from	britain	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	.	``	then	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	 separat 	 e 	 	fact	from	bias	.

then	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 choos 	 e 	 	your	 fact 	 s 	 	and	 bias 	 es 	 	and	create	an	image	of	your	own	story	of	dignity	.	``

i	was	so	inspired	.
i	went	and	 create 	 d 	 	my	own	version	of	indian	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 include 	 d 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	from	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
she	used	to	work	for	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	,	and	she	used	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 over 	 hear 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	between	nehru	and	edwina	mountbatten	.
and	she	used	to	hear	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	she	should	n't	have	heard	.	but	,	you	know	,	i	include	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	version	of	indian	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
you	know	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	,	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	 may 	 be 	 	,	just	 may 	 be 	 	,	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 object 	 ive 	 	of	our	 brain 	 s 	 	is	to	serve	our	dignity	.
go	tell	facebook	to	figure	that	out	!

education	is	great	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 teach 	 es 	 	us	who	we	are	,	and	 help 	 s 	 	us	in	the	world	,	but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	my	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	that	's	taught	me	that	i	can	be	much	more	than	what	my	education	told	me	i	am	.
i	'd	like	to	make	the	argument	that	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	tool	we	have	.
it	lets	us	create	who	we	are	,	and	 cur 	 ate 	 	what	is	to	come	.
i	like	to	think	--	thank	you	.
i	like	to	think	of	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 story 	 teller 	 	,	where	my	past	and	my	future	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	my	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	be	told	and	 re 	 told 	 	.	i	hope	all	of	you	one	day	get	a	chance	to	share	and	write	your	own	200	-	year	story	.
thank	you	so	much	.
