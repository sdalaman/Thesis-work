is	english	a	tsunami	,	 wash 	 ing 	 	away	other	 language 	 s 	 	?	not	 like 	 ly 	 	.
english	is	the	world	's	second	language	.
your	native	language	is	your	life	.
but	with	english	you	can	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	a	 wide 	 r 	 	conversation	:	a	global	conversation	about	global	 problem 	 s 	 	,	like	climate	change	or	poverty	,	or	 hung 	 er 	 	or	disease	.
the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	other	universal	 language 	 s 	 	.
 mathematic 	 s 	 	is	the	language	of	science	.
music	is	the	language	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
and	now	english	is	 be 	 coming 	 	the	language	of	problem	-	solving	.
not	 be 	 cause 	 	america	is	 push 	 ing 	 	it	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	the	world	is	 pull 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	english	mania	is	a	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	.
like	the	 harness 	 ing 	 	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	our	cities	or	the	fall	of	the	berlin	wall	,	english	 represent 	 s 	 	hope	for	a	better	future	--	a	future	where	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	a	common	language	to	solve	 it 	 s 	 	common	 problem 	 s 	 	.
