we	see	with	the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	we	see	with	the	brain	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	 see 	 ing 	 	with	the	brain	is	often	 call 	 ed 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
and	we	are	familiar	with	the	 land 	 scapes 	 	of	our	own	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	our	 in 	 scapes 	 	.	we	've	lived	with	them	all	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
they	do	n't	seem	to	be	of	our	creation	.
they	do	n't	seem	to	be	under	our	control	.
they	seem	to	come	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	to	mimic	 per 	 ception 	 	.
so	i	am	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	and	a	 part 	 icular 	 	sort	of	visual	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	which	i	see	among	my	 patient 	 s 	 	.
a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	got	a	phone	call	from	a	 nurs 	 ing 	 	home	where	i	work	.
they	told	me	that	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 resident 	 s 	 	,	an	old	 lad 	 y 	 	in	her	90s	,	was	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	she	'd	gone	 bon 	 ker 	 s 	 	or	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	an	old	 lad 	 y 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	she	'd	had	a	stroke	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	she	had	alzheimer	's	.
and	so	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	i	would	come	and	see	rosalie	,	the	old	 lad 	 y 	 	.
i	went	in	to	see	her	.
it	was	evident	straight	away	that	she	was	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ane 	 	and	lucid	and	of	good	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	but	she	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 start 	 led 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 be 	 wild 	 er 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	she	told	me	--	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	had	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	that	she	was	blind	,	that	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	blind	from	 ma 	 cular 	 	 de 	 generation 	 	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	now	,	for	the	last	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	she	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	sort	of	 thing 	 s 	 	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	people	in	eastern	dress	,	in	 d 	 rape 	 s 	 	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	 stair 	 s 	 	.

i	see	a	white	building	.	it	's	 snow 	 ing 	 	,	a	soft	snow	.
i	see	 th 	 is 	 	horse	with	a	harness	,	 drag 	 ging 	 	the	snow	away	.
then	,	one	night	,	the	scene	 change 	 s 	 	.
i	see	 cat 	 s 	 	and	 dog 	 s 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	me	.
they	come	to	a	certain	point	and	then	stop	.
then	it	 change 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.

i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	like	a	dream	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	it	's	not	like	a	dream	.	it	's	like	a	movie	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	got	color	.	it	's	got	motion	.

and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	it	's	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	movie	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	all	these	people	with	eastern	dress	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 repetit 	 ive 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	she	 ha 	 s 	 	a	sense	of	humor	.
she	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	a	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	.
but	she	was	 frighten 	 ed 	 	.	she	'd	lived	95	 year 	 s 	 	and	she	'd	never	had	a	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	before	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 related 	 	to	 any 	 thing 	 	she	was	 think 	 ing 	 	or	 feel 	 ing 	 	or	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	they	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	come	on	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	or	disappear	.
she	had	no	control	over	them	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	she	did	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	any	of	the	people	or	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.

and	she	did	n't	know	what	was	going	on	.
she	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	she	was	going	mad	or	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	her	mind	.
well	,	i	 examine 	 d 	 	her	 care 	 fully 	 	.
she	was	a	bright	old	 lad 	 y 	 	,	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ane 	 	.	she	had	no	medical	 problem 	 s 	 	.
she	was	n't	on	any	 medic 	 ations 	 	which	could	produce	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
but	she	was	blind	.
and	i	then	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	,	``	i	think	i	know	what	you	have	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	is	a	special	form	of	visual	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	which	may	go	with	 deterio 	 rating 	 	vision	or	 blind 	 ness 	 	.

and	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 reliev 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	the	matter	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	charles	bonnet	?	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	did	he	have	them	 him 	 self 	 	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	tell	all	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	that	i	have	charles	bonnet	syndrome	.	``
``	i	'm	not	crazy	.	i	'm	not	 de 	 ment 	 ed 	 	.	i	have	charles	bonnet	syndrome	.	``
well	,	so	i	did	tell	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	,	for	me	,	is	a	common	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
i	work	in	old	-	age	 home 	 s 	 	,	 large 	 ly 	 	.
i	see	a	lot	of	 elder 	 ly 	 	people	who	are	 hear 	 ing 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	or	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
about	10	percent	of	the	 hear 	 ing 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	musical	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
and	about	10	percent	of	the	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	visual	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
you	do	n't	have	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	blind	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
now	with	the	original	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	in	the	18th	century	,	charles	bonnet	did	not	have	them	.
his	 grand 	 father 	 	had	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
his	 grand 	 father 	 	was	a	 magist 	 rate 	 	,	an	 elder 	 ly 	 	man	.
he	'd	had	cataract	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
his	vision	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	poor	.
and	in	1759	,	he	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	his	 grand 	 son 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	he	was	 see 	 ing 	 	.
the	first	thing	he	 s 	 aid 	 	was	he	saw	a	handkerchief	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
it	was	a	large	blue	handkerchief	with	four	 o 	 range 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	a	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	.
you	do	n't	have	 handkerchief 	 s 	 	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
and	then	he	saw	a	big	wheel	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	he	was	n't	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	he	was	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	or	not	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	would	fit	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	the	 vision 	 s 	 	.
so	on	one	occasion	,	when	his	 grand 	 daughter 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 visit 	 ing 	 	them	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	who	are	these	 hand 	 some 	 	young	men	with	you	?	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ala 	 s 	 	,	grandpapa	,	there	are	no	 hand 	 some 	 	young	men	.	``
and	then	the	 hand 	 some 	 	young	men	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	typical	of	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	that	they	may	come	in	a	flash	and	disappear	in	a	flash	.
they	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	 fad 	 e 	 	in	and	out	.
they	are	 ra 	 ther 	 	sudden	,	and	they	change	 sudden 	 ly 	 	.
charles	lullin	,	the	 grand 	 father 	 	,	saw	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	different	 figure 	 s 	 	,	different	 land 	 scapes 	 	of	all	 sort 	 s 	 	.
on	one	occasion	,	he	saw	a	man	in	a	 bath 	 robe 	 	 smok 	 ing 	 	a	pipe	,	and	 real 	 ized 	 	it	was	 him 	 self 	 	.
that	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	figure	he	 recogn 	 ized 	 	.
on	one	occasion	when	he	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	paris	,	he	saw	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	real	--	a	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	.
but	when	he	got	back	home	,	he	saw	a	 miniatur 	 e 	 	of	the	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	six	 inch 	 es 	 	high	,	on	his	 stud 	 y 	 	table	.
 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 petition 	 	of	 per 	 ception 	 	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 pal 	 inopsia 	 	.
with	him	and	with	rosalie	,	what	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	going	on	--	and	rosalie	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	going	on	?	``	--	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	you	lose	vision	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	visual	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	any	 in 	 put 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 hyper 	 active 	 	and	 excit 	 able 	 	,	and	they	start	to	fire	 spontane 	 ously 	 	.
and	you	start	to	see	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	see	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
with	 an 	 other 	 	patient	of	mine	,	who	,	 al 	 so 	 	had	some	vision	,	the	vision	she	had	could	be	 disturb 	 ing 	 	.
on	one	occasion	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	she	saw	a	man	in	a	 strip 	 ed 	 	shirt	in	a	restaurant	.
and	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	.	and	then	he	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	six	 figure 	 s 	 	in	 strip 	 ed 	 	 shirt 	 s 	 	,	who	 start 	 ed 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	her	.
and	then	the	six	 figure 	 s 	 	came	together	 aga 	 in 	 	,	like	a	 concert 	 ina 	 	.
once	,	when	she	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	or	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	her	husband	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	the	road	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	four	and	she	felt	 her 	 self 	 	going	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	up	four	 road 	 s 	 	.
she	had	 ver 	 y 	 	mobile	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
a	lot	of	them	had	to	do	with	a	car	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	she	would	see	a	 teen 	 age 	 	boy	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	hood	of	the	car	.
he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 ten 	 acious 	 	and	he	 move 	 d 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 grace 	 fully 	 	when	the	car	 turn 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	when	they	came	to	a	stop	,	the	boy	would	do	a	sudden	 vert 	 ical 	 	 take 	 off 	 	,	100	foot	in	the	air	,	and	then	disappear	.
 an 	 other 	 	patient	of	mine	had	a	different	sort	of	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	woman	who	did	n't	have	trouble	with	her	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	the	visual	 part 	 s 	 	of	her	brain	,	a	little	tumor	in	the	 occip 	 ital 	 	cortex	.
and	,	above	all	,	she	would	see	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
these	 cartoon 	 s 	 	would	be	 trans 	 parent 	 	and	would	cover	half	the	visual	field	,	like	a	screen	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	she	saw	 cartoon 	 s 	 	of	kermit	the	frog	.
now	,	i	do	n't	watch	 s 	 e 	 same 	 	street	,	but	she	made	a	point	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	kermit	?	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	kermit	the	frog	 mean 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
you	know	,	i	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	freudian	 determi 	 nant 	 s 	 	.
why	kermit	?
kermit	the	frog	 mean 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	me	.	``
she	did	n't	mind	the	 cartoon 	 s 	 	too	much	.
but	what	did	disturb	her	was	she	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 persist 	 ent 	 	 image 	 s 	 	or	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	of	 face 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	with	rosalie	,	the	 face 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	often	 de 	 form 	 ed 	 	,	with	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 tee 	 th 	 	or	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 frighten 	 ed 	 	her	.
well	,	what	is	going	on	with	these	people	?
 a 	 s 	 	a	physician	,	i	have	to	try	and	define	what	's	going	on	,	and	to	 re 	 assure 	 	people	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	to	 re 	 assure 	 	them	that	they	're	not	going	 insan 	 e 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	like	10	percent	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	of	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	these	.
but	no	more	than	one	percent	of	the	people	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 af 	 raid 	 	they	will	be	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 insan 	 e 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	if	they	do	 ment 	 ion 	 	them	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 doctor 	 s 	 	they	may	be	 mis 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	 not 	 ion 	 	is	that	if	you	see	 thing 	 s 	 	or	hear	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	mad	,	but	the	 psycho 	 tic 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
 psycho 	 tic 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	are	visual	or	vocal	,	they	address	you	.	they	 accus 	 e 	 	you	.
they	seduce	you	.	they	 humil 	 iate 	 	you	.
they	 j 	 eer 	 	at	you	.
you	interact	with	them	.
there	is	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	quality	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 address 	 ed 	 	with	these	charles	bonnet	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
there	is	a	film	.	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	a	film	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	you	,	or	that	's	how	people	think	about	it	.
there	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	rare	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	temporal	lobe	epilepsy	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	if	one	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	one	may	feel	 one 	 self 	 	 transport 	 ed 	 	back	to	a	time	and	place	in	the	past	.
you	're	at	a	 part 	 icular 	 	road	junction	.
you	smell	 chest 	 nuts 	 	 roast 	 ing 	 	.
you	hear	the	traffic	.	all	the	 sense 	 s 	 	are	 involve 	 d 	 	.
and	you	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	your	girl	.
and	it	's	that	tuesday	 even 	 ing 	 	back	in	1982	.
and	the	temporal	lobe	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	are	all	-	sense	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	full	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	full	of	 familiar 	 ity 	 	,	 locate 	 d 	 	in	space	and	time	,	 cohere 	 nt 	 	,	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
the	charles	bonnet	 one 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
so	in	the	charles	bonnet	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	you	have	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 level 	 s 	 	,	from	the	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	--	the	pink	and	blue	 square 	 s 	 	the	woman	had	--	up	to	 quit 	 e 	 	elaborate	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	with	 figure 	 s 	 	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
 face 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 de 	 form 	 ed 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	are	the	single	 common 	 est 	 	thing	in	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
and	one	of	the	second	 common 	 est 	 	is	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
so	,	what	is	going	on	?
fascinatingly	,	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	possible	to	do	functional	brain	 image 	 ry 	 	,	to	do	fmri	on	people	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	to	find	that	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	visual	brain	are	 activate 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	.
when	people	have	these	simple	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	visual	cortex	is	 activate 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	part	of	the	brain	which	 perceive 	 s 	 	 edge 	 s 	 	and	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
you	do	n't	form	 image 	 s 	 	with	your	 prim 	 ary 	 	visual	cortex	.
when	 image 	 s 	 	are	 form 	 ed 	 	,	a	 high 	 er 	 	part	of	the	visual	cortex	is	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	temporal	lobe	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	one	area	of	the	temporal	lobe	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	.
and	it	's	known	that	if	people	have	damage	in	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	,	they	 may 	 be 	 	lose	the	ability	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
but	if	there	is	an	 ab 	 normal 	 	activity	in	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	,	they	may	 hallucin 	 ate 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	find	in	some	of	these	people	.
there	is	an	area	in	the	 an 	 terior 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	where	 tee 	 th 	 	and	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 represent 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	part	of	the	 gy 	 rus 	 	is	 activate 	 d 	 	when	people	get	the	 de 	 form 	 ed 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
there	is	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	brain	which	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 activate 	 d 	 	when	one	 s 	 ees 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 activate 	 d 	 	when	one	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	,	when	one	 draw 	 s 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	,	and	when	one	 hallucin 	 ates 	 	them	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	that	should	be	specific	.
there	are	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	which	are	 specific 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	 re 	 cognition 	 	and	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	of	 building 	 s 	 	and	 land 	 scapes 	 	.
around	1970	,	it	was	found	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	,	but	 part 	 icular 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
``	face	 cell 	 s 	 	``	 we 	 re 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	around	1970	.
and	now	we	know	that	there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	.
so	you	may	not	 on 	 ly 	 	have	``	car	``	 cell 	 s 	 	,	you	may	have	``	aston	martin	``	 cell 	 s 	 	.
i	saw	an	aston	martin	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
i	had	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	in	.
and	now	it	's	in	there	 some 	 where 	 	.
now	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	level	,	in	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 infer 	 o 	 temporal 	 	cortex	,	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	visual	 image 	 s 	 	,	or	 fig 	 ments 	 	or	 fragment 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	at	 high 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	that	the	other	 sense 	 s 	 	join	in	and	there	are	 connect 	 ions 	 	with	 memor 	 y 	 	and	emotion	.
and	in	the	charles	bonnet	syndrome	,	you	do	n't	go	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 high 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	.
you	're	in	these	 level 	 s 	 	of	 infer 	 ior 	 	visual	cortex	where	you	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	,	or	 fig 	 ments 	 	,	or	 fragment 	 ary 	 	 fig 	 ments 	 	,	all	 neural 	 ly 	 	 encode 	 d 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	or	small	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	.
 normal 	 ly 	 	these	are	all	part	of	the	 integrate 	 d 	 	stream	of	 per 	 ception 	 	,	or	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	and	one	is	not	conscious	of	them	.
it	is	 on 	 ly 	 	if	one	is	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	or	blind	that	the	process	is	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	normal	 per 	 ception 	 	,	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	an	 anarch 	 ic 	 	,	 convuls 	 ive 	 	 stimul 	 ation 	 	,	or	 re 	 lease 	 	,	of	all	of	these	visual	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	 infer 	 o 	 temporal 	 	cortex	.
so	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	you	see	a	face	.	 sudden 	 ly 	 	you	see	a	car	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	that	.
the	mind	 do 	 es 	 	 it 	 s 	 	best	to	organize	and	to	give	some	sort	of	 cohere 	 nce 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	.
when	these	 we 	 re 	 	first	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	it	was	thought	that	they	could	be	 interpret 	 ed 	 	like	 dream 	 s 	 	.
but	in	fact	people	say	,	``	i	do	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	people	.	i	ca	n't	form	any	 associ 	 ations 	 	.	``
``	kermit	 mean 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	me	.	``
you	do	n't	get	 any 	 where 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	.
well	,	i	've	more	or	less	 s 	 aid 	 	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	.
i	think	i	just	want	to	recapitulate	and	say	 th 	 is 	 	is	common	.
think	of	the	number	of	blind	people	.
there	must	be	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	blind	people	who	have	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	but	are	too	 scar 	 ed 	 	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	notice	,	for	 patient 	 s 	 	,	for	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	for	the	public	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	they	are	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 valu 	 able 	 	,	for	giving	one	some	 in 	 sight 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	the	brain	 work 	 s 	 	.
charles	bonnet	 s 	 aid 	 	,	250	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	he	 wonder 	 ed 	 	how	,	 think 	 ing 	 	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	how	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	put	it	,	the	theater	of	the	mind	could	be	generated	by	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	of	the	brain	.
now	,	250	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	think	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	 glimps 	 e 	 	how	 th 	 is 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	that	was	 super 	 b 	 	.	thank	you	so	much	.
you	speak	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	with	so	much	 in 	 sight 	 	and	 empath 	 y 	 	for	your	 patient 	 s 	 	.
have	you	 your 	 self 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	any	of	the	 syndrome 	 s 	 	you	write	about	?
oliver	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	:	i	was	 af 	 raid 	 	you	'd	ask	that	.
well	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	a	lot	of	them	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	'm	a	little	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	'm	blind	in	one	eye	,	and	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	good	in	the	other	.
and	i	see	the	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
but	they	stop	there	.
ca	:	and	they	do	n't	disturb	you	?
 be 	 cause 	 	you	understand	what	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	you	 worri 	 ed 	 	?
os	:	well	they	do	n't	disturb	me	any	more	than	my	 tin 	 nit 	 us 	 	,	which	i	 ignor 	 e 	 	.
they	 occasion 	 ally 	 	interest	me	,	and	i	have	 man 	 y 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	them	in	my	 note 	 book 	 s 	 	.
i	've	gone	and	had	an	fmri	 my 	 self 	 	,	to	see	how	my	visual	cortex	is	taking	over	.
and	when	i	see	all	these	 hexagon 	 s 	 	and	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	,	in	visual	migraine	,	i	wonder	 whet 	 her 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 ees 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	cave	art	or	 orna 	 mental 	 	art	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	derived	from	them	a	bit	.
ca	:	that	was	an	 utter 	 ly 	 	,	 utter 	 ly 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	talk	.
thank	you	so	much	for	sharing	.
os	:	thank	you	.	thank	you	.
