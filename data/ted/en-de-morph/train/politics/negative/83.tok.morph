i	have	all	my	life	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	``	mind	-	boggling	``	 me 	 ant 	 	.
after	two	 day 	 s 	 	here	,	i	declare	 my 	 self 	 	 boggl 	 ed 	 	,	and	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	,	and	feel	that	you	are	one	of	the	great	 hope 	 s 	 	--	not	just	for	american	 achiev 	 ement 	 	in	science	and	technology	,	but	for	the	whole	world	.
i	've	come	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	on	a	special	mission	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	my	 constit 	 uency 	 	,	which	are	the	10	-	to	-	the	-	18th	-	power	--	that	's	a	million	trillion	--	 insect 	 s 	 	and	other	small	 creature 	 s 	 	,	and	to	make	a	 ple 	 a 	 	for	them	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	wipe	out	 insect 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	just	that	group	 al 	 one 	 	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	--	which	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	hard	to	do	--	the	rest	of	life	and	 human 	 ity 	 	with	it	would	 most 	 ly 	 	disappear	from	the	land	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
now	,	how	did	i	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	position	of	 advoc 	 acy 	 	?
 a 	 s 	 	a	little	boy	,	and	through	my	 teen 	 age 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	life	.
i	had	a	 butter 	 fly 	 	period	,	a	snake	period	,	a	bird	period	,	a	fish	period	,	a	cave	period	and	 final 	 ly 	 	and	 definitive 	 ly 	 	,	an	ant	period	.
by	my	college	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	was	a	 devote 	 d 	 	 myrm 	 ecologist 	 	,	a	 special 	 ist 	 	on	the	biology	of	ants	,	but	my	attention	and	research	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	make	 journey 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	great	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	life	on	earth	in	general	--	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	all	that	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	,	how	little	we	understand	it	and	how	 press 	 ing 	 	a	danger	that	our	 activ 	 ities 	 	have	 create 	 d 	 	for	it	.
out	of	that	 broad 	 er 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	a	concern	and	an	 ambit 	 ion 	 	,	 crystall 	 ized 	 	in	the	wish	that	i	'm	about	to	make	to	you	.
my	choice	is	the	 culmin 	 ation 	 	of	a	 life 	 time 	 	 commit 	 ment 	 	that	 beg 	 an 	 	with	growing	up	on	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	coast	of	alabama	,	on	the	florida	 pen 	 insula 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	far	back	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	remember	,	i	was	 enchant 	 ed 	 	by	the	natural	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	that	region	and	the	 al 	 most 	 	 tropic 	 al 	 	 ex 	 uber 	 ance 	 	of	the	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	that	grow	there	.
one	day	when	i	was	 on 	 ly 	 	seven	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	i	 pull 	 ed 	 	a	``	 pin 	 fish 	 	,	``	they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	,	with	sharp	 dor 	 s 	 al 	 	 spin 	 es 	 	,	up	too	hard	and	fast	,	and	i	 blind 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	in	one	eye	.
i	 lat 	 er 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	hard	of	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	possibly	 con 	 genital 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	upper	 register 	 s 	 	.
so	in	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	be	a	professional	 natural 	 ist 	 	--	i	never	 consider 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	else	in	my	entire	life	--	i	found	that	i	was	 lous 	 y 	 	at	bird	 watch 	 ing 	 	and	could	n't	track	frog	 call 	 s 	 	either	.
so	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	the	 tee 	 ming 	 	small	 creature 	 s 	 	that	can	be	held	between	the	thumb	and	 fore 	 finger 	 	:	the	little	 thing 	 s 	 	that	compose	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	our	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	,	the	little	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	like	to	say	,	who	run	the	world	.
in	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	i	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	 front 	 ier 	 	of	biology	so	strange	,	so	rich	,	that	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 exist 	 s 	 	on	 an 	 other 	 	planet	.
in	fact	,	we	live	on	a	 most 	 ly 	 	 un 	 explore 	 d 	 	planet	.
the	great	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 organism 	 s 	 	on	earth	remain	 un 	 known 	 	to	science	.
in	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	 exploration 	 s 	 	in	remote	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	and	 advance 	 s 	 	in	technology	,	 biologist 	 s 	 	have	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 add 	 ed 	 	a	full	one	-	third	of	the	known	frog	and	other	 amphi 	 b 	 ian 	 	species	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	current	total	to	5,400	,	and	more	 continu 	 e 	 	to	pour	in	.
two	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 whale 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	two	new	 ant 	 elope 	 s 	 	,	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	monkey	species	and	a	new	kind	of	elephant	--	and	even	a	distinct	kind	of	gorilla	.
at	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	end	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 	scale	,	the	class	of	marine	bacteria	,	the	prochlorococci	--	that	will	be	on	the	final	 ex 	 am 	 	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	1988	,	are	now	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	the	most	abundant	 organism 	 s 	 	on	earth	,	and	 more 	 over 	 	,	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	a	large	part	of	the	 photo 	 synthesis 	 	that	 occur 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	.
these	bacteria	 we 	 re 	 	not	 un 	 cover 	 ed 	 	 soon 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	among	the	 small 	 est 	 	of	all	earth	's	 organism 	 s 	 	--	so	minute	that	they	can	not	be	 s 	 een 	 	with	 convention 	 al 	 	optical	 micro 	 s 	 copy 	 	.
yet	life	in	the	sea	may	depend	on	these	 tin 	 y 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
these	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	are	just	the	first	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	our	 ignor 	 ance 	 	of	life	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
consider	the	fungi	--	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	,	 rust 	 s 	 	,	 mold 	 s 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	disease	-	 caus 	 ing 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
60,000	species	are	known	to	science	,	but	more	than	1.5	million	have	 be 	 en 	 	 estimate 	 d 	 	to	exist	.
consider	the	nematode	 round 	 worm 	 	,	the	most	abundant	of	all	 animal 	 s 	 	.
four	out	of	five	 animal 	 s 	 	on	earth	are	nematode	 worm 	 s 	 	--	if	all	solid	 material 	 s 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	nematode	 worm 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	to	be	 eliminate 	 d 	 	,	you	could	still	see	the	 ghost 	 ly 	 	 out 	 line 	 	of	most	of	it	in	nematode	 worm 	 s 	 	.
about	16,000	species	of	nematode	 worm 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	and	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	by	 scientist 	 s 	 	;	there	could	be	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	them	,	even	 million 	 s 	 	,	still	 un 	 known 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	vast	domain	of	 hid 	 den 	 	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	is	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	still	further	by	the	dark	matter	of	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	world	of	bacteria	,	which	 with 	 in 	 	just	the	last	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	still	 we 	 re 	 	known	from	 on 	 ly 	 	about	6,000	species	of	bacteria	 world 	 wide 	 	.
but	that	number	of	bacteria	species	can	be	found	in	one	gram	of	 s 	 oil 	 	,	just	a	little	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	 s 	 oil 	 	,	in	the	10	billion	bacteria	that	would	be	there	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	a	single	ton	of	 s 	 oil 	 	--	 fertil 	 e 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	--	 contain 	 s 	 	 approximate 	 ly 	 	four	million	species	of	bacteria	,	all	 un 	 known 	 	.
so	the	question	is	:	what	are	they	all	 do 	 ing 	 	?
the	fact	is	,	we	do	n't	know	.
we	are	living	on	a	planet	with	a	lot	of	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	with	 re 	 ference 	 	to	our	living	environment	,	 d 	 one 	 	by	faith	and	guess	 al 	 one 	 	.
our	 live 	 s 	 	depend	 up 	 on 	 	these	 creature 	 s 	 	.
to	take	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	close	to	home	:	there	are	over	500	species	of	bacteria	now	known	--	friendly	bacteria	--	living	 sym 	 biotic 	 ally 	 	in	your	mouth	and	throat	 prob 	 ably 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	your	health	for	 hold 	 ing 	 	off	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	bacteria	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	point	i	think	we	have	a	little	 impression 	 istic 	 	film	that	was	made	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	occasion	.
and	i	'd	like	to	show	it	.
 assist 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	by	billie	 holi 	 day 	 	.
and	that	may	be	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	!
the	viruses	,	 t 	 hose 	 	quasi	-	 organism 	 s 	 	among	which	are	the	 pro 	 phage 	 s 	 	,	the	gene	 weave 	 rs 	 	that	promote	the	 continu 	 ed 	 	evolution	in	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	the	bacteria	,	are	a	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 un 	 known 	 	 front 	 ier 	 	of	modern	biology	,	a	world	 un 	 to 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.

but	 th 	 is 	 	much	we	can	say	:	the	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 gene 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	in	viruses	 exceed 	 s 	 	,	or	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	exceed	,	that	in	all	of	the	rest	of	life	 combine 	 d 	 	.

but	that	is	changing	 rapid 	 ly 	 	with	the	aid	of	new	genomic	technology	.
 al 	 ready 	 	it	is	possible	to	sequence	the	entire	genetic	code	of	a	 bacter 	 ium 	 	in	under	four	 hour 	 s 	 	.
soon	we	will	be	in	a	position	to	go	forth	in	the	field	with	 sequence 	 rs 	 	on	our	 back 	 s 	 	--	to	hunt	bacteria	in	 tin 	 y 	 	 cre 	 vice 	 s 	 	of	the	 habit 	 at 	 	's	surface	in	the	way	you	go	 watch 	 ing 	 	for	 bird 	 s 	 	with	 bin 	 ocular 	 s 	 	.
what	will	we	find	 a 	 s 	 	we	map	the	living	world	,	 a 	 s 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	 under 	 way 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	?

 al 	 ready 	 	what	 we 	 re 	 	thought	to	be	bacteria	for	 generation 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	found	to	compose	,	 in 	 stead 	 	,	two	great	 domain 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 organism 	 s 	 	:	true	bacteria	and	one	-	celled	 organism 	 s 	 	the	 arch 	 aea 	 	,	which	are	 close 	 r 	 	than	other	bacteria	to	the	 eukary 	 ota 	 	,	the	group	that	we	belong	to	.
some	serious	 biologist 	 s 	 	,	and	i	count	 my 	 self 	 	among	them	,	have	 beg 	 un 	 	to	wonder	that	among	the	enormous	and	still	 un 	 known 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 micro 	 organism 	 s 	 	,	one	might	--	just	might	--	find	 alien 	 s 	 	among	them	.

we	do	know	that	some	bacterial	species	that	have	 earth 	 ly 	 	origin	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 al 	 most 	 	 un 	 imagin 	 able 	 	 extrem 	 es 	 	of	temperature	and	other	harsh	 change 	 s 	 	in	environment	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	hard	 radi 	 ation 	 	strong	 en 	 ough 	 	and	 maintain 	 ed 	 	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	crack	the	pyrex	 vessel 	 s 	 	around	the	growing	population	of	bacteria	.
there	may	be	a	 tempt 	 ation 	 	to	treat	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	 hol 	 istically 	 	and	the	species	that	compose	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	great	flux	of	 ent 	 ities 	 	 hard 	 ly 	 	worth	 distinguish 	 ing 	 	one	from	the	other	.
but	each	of	these	species	,	even	the	 tin 	 iest 	 	prochlorococci	,	are	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	evolution	.
each	 ha 	 s 	 	 persist 	 ed 	 	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	to	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.

we	will	destroy	these	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	and	the	species	 com 	 posing 	 	them	at	the	peril	of	our	own	 exist 	 ence 	 	--	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	we	are	 destroy 	 ing 	 	them	with	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	and	 cease 	 less 	 	energy	.
my	own	 epiph 	 any 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 conserv 	 ation 	 ist 	 	came	in	1953	,	while	a	harvard	graduate	student	,	 search 	 ing 	 	for	rare	ants	found	in	the	mountain	 forest 	 s 	 	of	cuba	,	ants	that	shine	in	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	--	 metal 	 lic 	 	green	or	 metal 	 lic 	 	blue	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	species	,	and	one	species	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	 metal 	 lic 	 	gold	.

so	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	my	wish	for	tedsters	,	and	to	 any 	 one 	 	else	around	the	world	who	 hear 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
i	wish	we	will	work	together	to	help	create	the	key	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	inspire	 p 	 reservation 	 	of	earth	's	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
and	let	us	call	it	the	``	encyclopedia	of	life	.	``
what	is	the	``	encyclopedia	of	life	?	``	a	 con 	 cept 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	taken	hold	and	is	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	spread	and	be	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 serious 	 ly 	 	?
it	is	an	encyclopedia	that	 live 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	is	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	by	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
 amateur 	 s 	 	can	do	it	 al 	 so 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 definite 	 ly 	 	 expand 	 able 	 	page	for	each	species	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	all	key	information	about	life	on	earth	 access 	 ible 	 	to	 any 	 one 	 	,	on	demand	,	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
i	've	written	about	 th 	 is 	 	idea	before	,	and	i	know	there	are	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	who	have	 expend 	 ed 	 	significant	effort	on	it	in	the	past	.
but	what	 excit 	 es 	 	me	is	that	since	i	first	put	forward	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	idea	in	that	form	,	science	 ha 	 s 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	.
technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	forward	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	the	 practical 	 ities 	 	of	making	 s 	 uch 	 	an	encyclopedia	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	 magn 	 itude 	 	of	the	information	put	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	are	 with 	 in 	 	reach	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	in	the	past	year	,	a	group	of	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	scientific	 institution 	 s 	 	have	 beg 	 un 	 	 mobil 	 izing 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	dream	.
i	wish	you	would	help	them	.
 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	we	can	make	 th 	 is 	 	real	.
the	encyclopedia	will	 quick 	 ly 	 	pay	for	 it 	 self 	 	in	practical	 application 	 s 	 	.
it	will	address	 transcend 	 ent 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	in	the	human	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	and	sense	of	human	need	.
it	will	transform	the	science	of	biology	in	ways	of	obvious	benefit	to	 human 	 ity 	 	.
and	most	of	all	,	it	can	inspire	a	new	generation	of	 biologist 	 s 	 	to	 continu 	 e 	 	the	quest	that	 start 	 ed 	 	,	for	me	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	60	 year 	 s 	 	ago	:	to	search	for	life	,	to	understand	it	and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	above	all	,	to	preserve	it	.
that	is	my	wish	.	thank	you	.
