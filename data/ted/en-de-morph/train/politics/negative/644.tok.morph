 clear 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	living	in	a	moment	of	crisis	.
 argu 	 ably 	 	the	financial	 market 	 s 	 	have	 fail 	 ed 	 	us	and	the	aid	system	is	 fail 	 ing 	 	us	,	and	yet	i	stand	 firm 	 ly 	 	with	the	 optimist 	 s 	 	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	a	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	moment	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	some	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 resource 	 s 	 	,	the	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	 s 	 urge 	 	of	talent	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	all	around	the	world	,	with	the	 mind 	 set 	 	to	create	change	.
and	we	've	got	a	 p 	 resident 	 	who	 s 	 ees 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	global	citizen	,	who	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	no	 long 	 er 	 	is	there	a	single	 super 	 power 	 	,	but	that	we	've	got	to	engage	in	a	different	way	with	the	world	.
and	by	definition	,	every	one	of	you	who	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	must	consider	 your 	 self 	 	a	global	soul	,	a	global	citizen	.
you	work	on	the	front	lines	.	and	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	best	and	the	worst	that	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	can	do	for	one	 an 	 other 	 	and	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	no	matter	what	country	you	live	or	work	in	,	you	've	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 een 	 	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 individual 	 s 	 	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	,	even	in	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 ordinari 	 ness 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	there	is	a	 rag 	 ing 	 	debate	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	best	we	lift	people	out	of	poverty	,	how	best	we	 re 	 lease 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 energ 	 ies 	 	.
on	the	one	hand	,	we	have	people	that	say	the	aid	system	is	so	broken	we	need	to	throw	it	out	.
and	on	the	other	we	have	people	who	say	the	problem	is	that	we	need	more	aid	.
and	what	i	want	to	talk	about	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 compliment 	 s 	 	both	 system 	 s 	 	.
we	call	it	patient	capital	.
the	 critic 	 s 	 	point	to	the	500	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	in	africa	since	1970	and	say	,	and	what	do	we	have	but	 environment 	 al 	 	degradation	and	 in 	 credible 	 	 level 	 s 	 	of	poverty	,	 ramp 	 ant 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	?
they	use	mobutu	 a 	 s 	 	metaphor	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	policy	prescription	is	to	make	government	more	 account 	 able 	 	,	focus	on	the	capital	 market 	 s 	 	,	invest	,	do	n't	give	 any 	 thing 	 	away	.
on	the	other	side	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	are	 t 	 hose 	 	who	say	the	problem	is	that	we	need	more	money	.
that	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	rich	,	we	'll	bail	out	and	we	'll	hand	a	lot	of	aid	,	but	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	our	poor	brethren	,	we	want	little	to	do	with	it	.
they	point	to	the	 success 	 es 	 	of	aid	:	the	 eradic 	 ation 	 	of	 small 	 pox 	 	,	and	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	malaria	bed	 net 	 s 	 	and	antiretrovirals	.
both	 side 	 s 	 	are	right	.
and	the	problem	is	that	 n 	 either 	 	side	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	other	.
even	more	 problem 	 atic 	 	,	they	're	not	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	poor	people	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
after	25	 year 	 s 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 issue 	 s 	 	of	poverty	and	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	it	's	true	that	there	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	no	more	market	-	oriented	 individual 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	than	low	-	income	people	.
they	must	 navig 	 ate 	 	 market 	 s 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	,	making	micro	-	 decision 	 s 	 	,	 dozen 	 s 	 	and	 dozen 	 s 	 	,	to	move	 the 	 ir 	 	way	through	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	and	yet	if	a	single	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	health	problem	 impact 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	family	,	they	could	be	put	back	 in 	 to 	 	poverty	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	for	 generation 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	need	both	the	market	and	we	need	aid	.
patient	capital	 work 	 s 	 	between	,	and	tries	to	take	the	best	of	both	.
it	's	money	that	's	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	who	know	 the 	 ir 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	are	building	 solution 	 s 	 	to	 health 	 care 	 	,	water	,	housing	,	 alter 	 native 	 	energy	,	 think 	 ing 	 	of	low	income	people	not	 a 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ive 	 	 recipient 	 s 	 	of	 char 	 ity 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	individual	 custom 	 ers 	 	,	 consumer 	 s 	 	,	 client 	 s 	 	,	people	who	want	to	make	 decision 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 live 	 s 	 	.
patient	capital	 requir 	 es 	 	that	we	have	 in 	 credible 	 	 toler 	 ance 	 	for	risk	,	a	long	time	horizon	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 allow 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	time	to	experiment	,	to	use	the	market	 a 	 s 	 	the	best	 listen 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	that	we	have	,	and	the	 expect 	 ation 	 	of	 be 	 low 	 	-	market	 return 	 s 	 	,	but	 out 	 sized 	 	social	impact	.
it	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	the	market	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 limit 	 ation 	 	,	and	so	patient	capital	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 s 	 	with	smart	 sub 	 s 	 idy 	 	to	extend	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	a	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	include	all	people	.
now	,	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	need	patient	capital	for	three	 reason 	 s 	 	.
first	,	they	tend	to	work	in	 market 	 s 	 	where	people	make	one	,	two	,	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	and	they	are	making	all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	that	income	level	.
second	,	the	 ge 	 ographies 	 	in	which	they	work	have	 terr 	 ible 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	--	no	 road 	 s 	 	to	speak	of	,	sporadic	 electric 	 ity 	 	and	high	 level 	 s 	 	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
third	,	they	are	often	creating	 market 	 s 	 	.
even	if	you	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	clean	water	for	the	first	time	 in 	 to 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	 village 	 s 	 	,	it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
and	so	 man 	 y 	 	low	-	income	people	have	 s 	 een 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	 promise 	 s 	 	broken	and	 s 	 een 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	quacks	and	sporadic	 medicine 	 s 	 	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	them	that	building	trust	 take 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	time	,	 take 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	patience	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	a	lot	of	management	 assist 	 ance 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	build	the	 system 	 s 	 	,	the	business	 model 	 s 	 	that	allow	us	to	reach	low	income	people	in	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	way	,	but	to	connect	 t 	 hose 	 	business	to	other	 market 	 s 	 	,	to	 government 	 s 	 	,	to	 corporation 	 s 	 	--	real	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	if	we	want	to	get	to	scale	.
i	want	to	share	one	story	about	an	 innov 	 ation 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	drip	 irrig 	 ation 	 	.
in	2002	i	met	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	entrepreneur	named	amitabha	sadangi	from	india	,	who	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	with	some	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	on	the	planet	.
and	he	was	 express 	 ing 	 	his	 frust 	 ration 	 	that	the	aid	market	had	 bypass 	 ed 	 	low	-	income	 farm 	 ers 	 	 al 	 together 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	200	million	 farm 	 ers 	 	 al 	 one 	 	in	india	make	under	a	dollar	a	day	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	creating	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	either	for	large	 farm 	 s 	 	,	or	they	 we 	 re 	 	giving	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	to	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	that	they	thought	they	should	use	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	that	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	use	.
at	the	same	time	amitabha	was	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	drip	 irrig 	 ation 	 	technology	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	israel	.
it	was	a	way	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	small	 amount 	 s 	 	of	water	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	 s 	 talk 	 	of	the	plant	.
and	it	could	transform	 swath 	 s 	 	of	desert	land	 in 	 to 	 	 field 	 s 	 	of	emerald	green	.
but	the	market	 al 	 so 	 	had	 bypass 	 ed 	 	low	income	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 system 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	both	too	expensive	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	for	 field 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	too	large	.
the	average	small	village	 farm 	 er 	 	 work 	 s 	 	on	two	 acre 	 s 	 	or	less	.
and	so	,	amitabha	 decide 	 d 	 	that	he	would	take	that	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	he	would	 re 	 design 	 	it	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	the	poor	 farm 	 ers 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 s 	 pent 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	what	they	 need 	 ed 	 	not	what	he	thought	that	they	should	have	.
and	he	used	three	fundamental	 principle 	 s 	 	.
the	first	one	was	 miniatur 	 ization 	 	.
the	drip	 irrig 	 ation 	 	system	had	to	be	small	 en 	 ough 	 	that	a	 farm 	 er 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	had	to	risk	a	quarter	acre	,	even	if	he	had	two	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	too	 frighten 	 ing 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	all	that	he	had	at	 s 	 take 	 	.
second	,	it	had	to	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 afford 	 able 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	that	risk	on	the	quarter	acre	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	repaid	in	a	single	harvest	,	or	else	they	would	n't	take	the	risk	.
and	third	,	it	had	to	be	what	amitabha	 call 	 s 	 	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 expand 	 able 	 	.
what	i	mean	is	with	the	 profit 	 s 	 	from	the	first	quarter	acre	,	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	could	buy	a	second	and	a	third	and	a	fourth	.
 a 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	ide	india	,	amitabha	's	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 old 	 	over	300,000	 farm 	 ers 	 	these	 system 	 s 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 yield 	 s 	 	and	 income 	 s 	 	double	or	triple	on	average	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	did	n't	happen	 over 	 night 	 	.
in	fact	,	when	you	go	back	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	private	 invest 	 ors 	 	who	would	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	a	risk	on	building	a	new	technology	for	a	market	class	that	made	under	a	dollar	a	day	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	known	to	be	some	of	the	most	risk	-	 a 	 verse 	 	people	on	the	planet	and	that	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	one	of	the	 risk 	 iest 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	,	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
and	so	we	 need 	 ed 	 	 grant 	 s 	 	.	and	he	used	significant	 grant 	 s 	 	to	research	,	to	experiment	,	to	fail	,	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	and	try	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	when	he	had	a	prototype	and	had	a	better	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	how	to	market	to	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	that	's	when	patient	capital	could	come	in	.
and	we	 help 	 ed 	 	him	build	a	company	,	for	profit	,	that	would	build	on	ide	's	knowledge	,	and	start	looking	at	 sale 	 s 	 	and	 export 	 s 	 	,	and	be	able	to	tap	 in 	 to 	 	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	capital	.
secondarily	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	if	we	could	export	 th 	 is 	 	drip	 irrig 	 ation 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	so	we	met	dr.	sono	khangharani	in	pakistan	.
and	while	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	 need 	 ed 	 	patience	to	move	a	technology	for	the	poor	in	india	 in 	 to 	 	pakistan	,	just	to	get	the	 permit 	 s 	 	,	over	time	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	start	a	company	with	dr.	sono	,	who	 run 	 s 	 	a	large	community	 develop 	 ment 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	in	the	thar	desert	,	which	is	one	of	the	remote	and	 poor 	 est 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	country	.
and	 th 	 ough 	 	that	company	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 start 	 ed 	 	,	our	assumption	is	that	there	too	we	'll	see	the	impact	on	 million 	 s 	 	.
but	drip	 irrig 	 ation 	 	is	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	these	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	around	the	world	.
in	arusha	,	tanzania	,	a	to	z	 text 	 ile 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	in	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	us	,	with	unicef	,	with	the	global	fund	,	to	create	a	 factor 	 y 	 	that	now	 employ 	 s 	 	7,000	people	,	 most 	 ly 	 	women	.
and	they	produce	20	million	 life 	 saving 	 	bednets	for	africans	around	the	world	.
lifespring	hospital	is	a	joint	venture	between	acumen	and	the	government	of	india	to	 br 	 ing 	 	quality	,	 afford 	 able 	 	 ma 	 ternal 	 	health	care	to	low	-	income	women	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	so	 success 	 ful 	 	that	it	's	 current 	 ly 	 	building	a	new	hospital	every	35	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	1298	 ambul 	 ance 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	that	it	was	going	to	 re 	 invent 	 	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	broken	industry	,	building	an	 ambul 	 ance 	 	service	in	bombay	that	would	use	the	technology	of	google	earth	,	a	 slid 	 ing 	 	scale	 pric 	 ing 	 	system	so	that	all	people	could	have	access	,	and	a	severe	and	public	decision	not	to	engage	in	any	form	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
so	that	in	the	terrorist	 attack 	 s 	 	of	november	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	responder	,	and	are	now	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	scale	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 partner 	 ship 	 	.
they	've	just	won	four	government	 contract 	 s 	 	to	build	off	 the 	 ir 	 	100	 ambul 	 ance 	 s 	 	,	and	are	one	of	the	largest	and	most	effective	 ambul 	 ance 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	india	.
 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	scale	is	critical	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	these	 enterprise 	 s 	 	reach	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.	all	of	the	 one 	 s 	 	i	 discuss 	 ed 	 	have	 reach 	 ed 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	quarter	million	people	.
but	that	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
and	it	's	where	the	idea	of	 partner 	 ship 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	by	 find 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	that	can	access	the	capital	 market 	 s 	 	,	government	 it 	 self 	 	,	or	partner	with	major	 corporation 	 s 	 	,	there	is	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
 p 	 resident 	 	obama	 understand 	 s 	 	that	.
he	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 author 	 ized 	 	the	creation	of	a	social	 innov 	 ation 	 	fund	to	focus	on	what	 work 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	and	look	at	how	we	can	scale	it	.
and	i	would	submit	that	it	's	time	to	consider	a	global	 innov 	 ation 	 	fund	that	would	find	these	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	around	the	world	who	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 innov 	 ations 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	country	,	but	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	can	use	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
invest	financial	 assist 	 ance 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	management	 assist 	 ance 	 	.
and	then	measure	the	 return 	 s 	 	,	both	from	a	financial	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	and	from	a	social	impact	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
when	we	think	about	new	 approach 	 es 	 	to	aid	,	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	not	to	talk	about	pakistan	.
we	've	had	a	 rock 	 y 	 	relationship	with	that	country	and	,	in	all	 fair 	 ness 	 	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 reli 	 able 	 	partner	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	i	would	say	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	moment	for	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	happen	.
and	if	we	take	that	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	global	 innov 	 ation 	 	fund	,	we	could	use	 th 	 is 	 	time	to	invest	not	 direct 	 ly 	 	in	government	,	 th 	 ough 	 	we	would	have	government	's	 bless 	 ing 	 	,	nor	in	 inter 	 national 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	,	but	in	the	 man 	 y 	 	 exist 	 ing 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	and	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	who	 al 	 ready 	 	are	building	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	that	are	 reach 	 ing 	 	people	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	.
people	like	rashani	zafar	,	who	 create 	 d 	 	one	of	the	largest	 micro 	 finance 	 	 bank 	 s 	 	in	the	country	,	and	is	a	real	role	model	for	women	 in 	 side 	 	and	 out 	 side 	 	the	country	.
and	tasneem	siddiqui	,	who	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	way	 call 	 ed 	 	 increment 	 al 	 	housing	,	where	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	40,000	 s 	 lum 	 	dwellers	 in 	 to 	 	safe	,	 afford 	 able 	 	community	housing	.

it	's	not	 hyper 	 bo 	 le 	 	to	say	that	these	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	and	these	social	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	are	building	real	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	to	the	taliban	.
i	've	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	pakistan	for	over	seven	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	've	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	there	can	 at 	 test 	 	that	pakistanis	are	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	hard	 work 	 ing 	 	population	,	and	there	is	a	fierce	 up 	 ward 	 	 mobil 	 ity 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	.

i	would	say	that	the	 con 	 verse 	 	is	true	.
that	these	social	 lead 	 ers 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	are	looking	at	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	 extend 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	the	70	percent	of	pakistanis	who	make	less	than	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	,	provide	real	 path 	 ways 	 	to	hope	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	think	about	how	we	construct	aid	for	pakistan	,	while	we	need	to	 strength 	 en 	 	the	 judi 	 ci 	 ary 	 	,	build	 great 	 er 	 	 st 	 ability 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	think	about	 lift 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	who	can	be	role	 model 	 s 	 	for	the	rest	of	the	world	.
on	one	of	my	last	 visit 	 s 	 	to	pakistan	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	dr.	sono	if	he	would	take	me	to	see	some	of	the	drip	 irrig 	 ation 	 	in	the	thar	desert	.
and	we	left	karachi	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	before	dawn	.
it	was	about	115	 degree 	 s 	 	.
and	we	drove	for	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 moon 	 s 	 cape 	 	-	like	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	with	 ver 	 y 	 	little	color	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	heat	,	 ver 	 y 	 	little	 discuss 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	at	the	end	of	the	journey	,	i	could	see	 th 	 is 	 	thin	little	yellow	line	 a 	 cross 	 	the	horizon	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	got	 close 	 r 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 	.
that	there	in	the	desert	was	a	field	of	 s 	 un 	 flower 	 s 	 	growing	seven	feet	tall	.
 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	on	earth	had	gotten	access	to	a	technology	that	had	 allow 	 ed 	 	him	to	change	his	own	life	.
his	name	was	raja	,	and	he	had	kind	,	 twinkl 	 y 	 	hazel	 eye 	 s 	 	and	warm	 express 	 ive 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 minded 	 	me	of	my	father	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	the	first	dry	season	in	his	entire	life	that	he	had	n't	taken	his	12	children	and	50	 grand 	 children 	 	on	a	two	day	journey	 a 	 cross 	 	the	desert	to	work	 a 	 s 	 	day	 labor 	 ers 	 	at	a	commercial	farm	for	about	50	 cent 	 s 	 	a	day	.
 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	building	these	 crop 	 s 	 	.
and	with	the	money	he	 earn 	 ed 	 	he	could	stay	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	for	the	first	time	ever	in	three	 generation 	 s 	 	,	his	children	would	go	to	school	.
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	if	he	would	 s 	 end 	 	his	 daughter 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	his	 son 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	of	course	i	will	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	want	them	 discriminate 	 d 	 	against	 any 	 more 	 	.	``
when	we	think	about	 solution 	 s 	 	to	poverty	,	we	can	not	 den 	 y 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	fundamental	dignity	.
 be 	 cause 	 	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	dignity	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	human	spirit	than	wealth	.
and	what	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	is	to	see	so	 man 	 y 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	who	are	building	 innov 	 ations 	 	that	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	what	people	want	is	 free 	 dom 	 	and	choice	and	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	where	dignity	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 s 	 	.
martin	luther	king	 s 	 aid 	 	that	love	 with 	 out 	 	power	is	anemic	and	 sentiment 	 al 	 	,	and	that	power	 with 	 out 	 	love	is	reckless	and	 a 	 bus 	 ive 	 	.
our	generation	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	both	 approach 	 es 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	,	and	often	fail	.
but	i	think	our	generation	 al 	 so 	 	might	be	the	first	to	have	the	courage	to	embrace	both	love	and	power	.
for	that	is	what	we	'll	need	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	move	forward	to	dream	and	imagine	what	it	will	 re 	 ally 	 	take	to	build	a	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	 include 	 s 	 	all	of	us	,	and	to	 final 	 ly 	 	extend	that	fundamental	 pro 	 position 	 	that	all	men	are	 create 	 d 	 	equal	to	every	human	 be 	 ing 	 	on	the	planet	.
the	time	for	us	to	begin	 innov 	 ating 	 	and	looking	for	new	 solution 	 s 	 	,	a	cross	sector	,	is	now	.
i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	talk	from	my	own	experience	,	but	in	eight	 year 	 s 	 	of	running	acumen	fund	,	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	power	of	patient	capital	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	inspire	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	risk	taking	,	but	to	 tru 	 ly 	 	build	 system 	 s 	 	that	have	 create 	 d 	 	more	than	25,000	 job 	 s 	 	and	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 service 	 s 	 	and	 product 	 s 	 	to	some	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	people	on	the	planet	.
i	know	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
but	i	know	that	 man 	 y 	 	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	 al 	 so 	 	work	.
and	so	i	urge	you	,	in	 what 	 ever 	 	sector	you	work	,	in	 what 	 ever 	 	job	you	do	,	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	we	might	build	 solution 	 s 	 	that	start	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	what	we	think	that	they	might	need	.
it	will	take	 em 	 bracing 	 	the	world	with	both	 arm 	 s 	 	.
and	it	will	take	living	with	the	spirit	of	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	and	 account 	 ability 	 	,	with	a	sense	of	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	and	 persever 	 ance 	 	.
and	yet	these	are	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	for	which	men	and	women	have	 be 	 en 	 	 honor 	 ed 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	 generation 	 s 	 	.
and	there	is	so	much	good	that	we	can	do	.
just	think	of	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 un 	 flower 	 s 	 	in	the	desert	.
thank	you	.
