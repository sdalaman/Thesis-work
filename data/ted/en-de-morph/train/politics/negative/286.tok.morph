 prob 	 ably 	 	a	lot	of	you	know	the	story	of	the	two	 sale 	 s 	 men 	 	who	went	down	to	africa	in	the	1900s	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	down	to	find	if	there	was	any	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	selling	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	and	they	wrote	 tele 	 gram 	 s 	 	back	to	manchester	.
and	one	of	them	wrote	,	``	 situ 	 ation 	 	 hope 	 less 	 	.	stop	.
they	do	n't	wear	 shoe 	 s 	 	.	``
and	the	other	one	wrote	,	``	 glor 	 ious 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
they	do	n't	have	any	 shoe 	 s 	 	yet	.	``
now	,	there	's	a	similar	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	the	 classic 	 al 	 	music	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	some	people	who	think	that	 classic 	 al 	 	music	is	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
and	there	are	some	of	us	who	think	you	ai	n't	 s 	 een 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	yet	.
and	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	go	 in 	 to 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	and	 trend 	 s 	 	,	and	tell	you	about	all	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	that	are	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	record	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	are	 fold 	 ing 	 	,	i	thought	we	should	do	an	experiment	 to 	 night 	 	--	an	experiment	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	an	experiment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	the	 out 	 come 	 	.
but	it	's	like	an	experiment	.	now	,	before	we	--	--	before	we	start	,	i	need	to	do	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	is	i	want	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	what	a	seven	-	year	-	old	child	 sound 	 s 	 	like	when	he	 play 	 s 	 	the	piano	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	child	at	home	.
he	 sound 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	see	some	of	you	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	child	.
now	,	if	he	 practice 	 s 	 	for	a	year	and	 take 	 s 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	,	he	's	now	eight	and	he	 sound 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
then	he	 practice 	 s 	 	for	 an 	 other 	 	year	and	 take 	 s 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	--	now	he	's	nine	.
then	he	 practice 	 s 	 	for	 an 	 other 	 	and	 take 	 s 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	--	now	he	's	10	.
at	that	point	,	they	 usual 	 ly 	 	give	up	.
now	,	if	you	'd	 wait 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	'd	 wait 	 ed 	 	for	one	more	year	,	you	would	have	heard	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	not	 may 	 be 	 	what	you	thought	,	which	is	,	he	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	passionate	,	 engag 	 ed 	 	,	 involve 	 d 	 	,	got	a	new	teacher	,	he	hit	puberty	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	the	 impulse 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	.
you	see	,	the	first	time	,	he	was	 play 	 ing 	 	with	an	impulse	on	every	note	.
and	the	second	,	with	an	impulse	every	other	note	.
you	can	see	it	by	looking	at	my	head	.
the	nine	-	year	-	old	put	an	impulse	on	every	four	 note 	 s 	 	.
and	the	10	-	year	-	old	,	on	every	eight	 note 	 s 	 	.
and	the	11	-	year	-	old	,	one	impulse	on	the	whole	phrase	.
i	know	--	i	do	n't	know	how	we	got	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	position	.
i	did	n't	say	,	``	i	'm	going	to	move	my	shoulder	over	,	move	my	body	.	``
no	,	the	music	 push 	 ed 	 	me	over	,	which	is	why	i	call	it	one	-	buttock	 play 	 ing 	 	.
it	can	be	the	other	buttock	.
you	know	,	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	was	once	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	 present 	 ation 	 	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	when	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	a	young	pianist	.
he	was	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	a	corporation	in	ohio	.
and	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	young	pianist	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	trouble	with	you	is	you	're	a	two	-	buttock	player	.
you	should	be	a	one	-	buttock	player	.	``
and	i	 move 	 d 	 	his	body	like	that	,	while	he	was	 play 	 ing 	 	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	the	music	took	off	.	it	took	flight	.
there	was	a	gasp	in	the	audience	when	they	heard	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	then	i	got	a	letter	from	 th 	 is 	 	 gentle 	 man 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	was	so	 move 	 d 	 	.
i	went	back	and	i	 transform 	 ed 	 	my	entire	company	 in 	 to 	 	a	one	-	buttock	company	.	``
now	,	the	other	thing	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	is	to	tell	you	about	you	.
there	are	1,600	people	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.
my	estimation	is	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	45	of	you	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	passionate	about	 classic 	 al 	 	music	.
you	 ador 	 e 	 	 classic 	 al 	 	music	.	your	fm	is	 al 	 ways 	 	on	that	 classic 	 al 	 	dial	.
and	you	have	cds	in	your	car	,	and	you	go	to	the	 sym 	 phony 	 	.
and	your	children	are	 play 	 ing 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
you	ca	n't	imagine	your	life	 with 	 out 	 	 classic 	 al 	 	music	.
that	's	the	first	group	;	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	small	group	.
then	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	group	,	 big 	 ger 	 	group	.
these	are	the	people	who	do	n't	mind	 classic 	 al 	 	music	.
you	know	,	you	've	come	home	from	a	long	day	,	and	you	take	a	glass	of	wine	,	and	you	put	your	feet	up	.
a	little	vivaldi	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	any	harm	.
that	's	the	second	group	.
now	 come 	 s 	 	the	third	group	.
these	are	the	people	who	never	listen	to	 classic 	 al 	 	music	.
it	's	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	part	of	your	life	.
you	might	hear	it	like	second	-	hand	smoke	at	the	 air 	 port 	 	,	but	--	--	and	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	bit	of	a	march	from	``	aida	``	when	you	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	hall	.	but	 other 	 wise 	 	,	you	never	hear	it	.
that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	largest	group	of	all	.
and	then	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	group	.
these	are	the	people	who	think	they	're	tone	-	deaf	.
 amaz 	 ing 	 	number	of	people	think	they	're	tone	-	deaf	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	hear	a	lot	,	``	my	husband	is	tone	-	deaf	.	``
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	not	be	tone	-	deaf	.	 no 	 body 	 	is	tone	-	deaf	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	tone	-	deaf	,	you	could	n't	change	the	 gear 	 s 	 	on	your	car	,	in	a	stick	shift	car	.
you	could	n't	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 some 	 body 	 	from	texas	and	 some 	 body 	 	from	rome	.
and	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	.	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	.	if	your	mother	 call 	 s 	 	on	the	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	she	 call 	 s 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 hell 	 o 	 	,	``	you	not	 on 	 ly 	 	know	who	it	is	,	you	know	what	mood	she	's	in	.
you	have	a	fantastic	ear	.	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	fantastic	ear	.
so	 no 	 body 	 	is	tone	-	deaf	.
but	i	tell	you	what	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	for	me	to	go	on	with	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	with	 s 	 uch 	 	a	wide	 gu 	 lf 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	who	understand	,	love	and	[	are	]	passionate	about	 classic 	 al 	 	music	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	no	relationship	to	it	at	all	.
the	tone	-	deaf	people	,	they	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	here	.
but	even	between	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	it	's	too	wide	a	 gu 	 lf 	 	.
so	i	'm	not	going	to	go	on	 un 	 til 	 	every	single	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	and	in	aspen	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	else	looking	,	will	come	to	love	and	understand	 classic 	 al 	 	music	.
so	that	's	what	we	're	going	to	do	.
now	,	you	notice	that	there	is	not	the	 s 	 light 	 est 	 	doubt	in	my	mind	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	work	if	you	look	at	my	face	,	right	?
it	's	one	of	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	a	 lead 	 er 	 	that	he	not	doubt	for	one	moment	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	the	people	he	's	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	he	's	 dream 	 ing 	 	.
imagine	if	martin	luther	king	had	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	a	dream	.
of	course	,	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	they	'll	be	up	to	it	.	``
all	right	.	so	i	'm	going	to	take	a	piece	of	chopin	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 pre 	 lude 	 	by	chopin	.	some	of	you	will	know	it	.
do	you	know	what	i	think	 prob 	 ably 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	?
when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	,	you	thought	,	``	how	 beaut 	 iful 	 	that	 sound 	 s 	 	.	``
``	i	do	n't	think	we	should	go	to	the	same	place	for	our	summer	 holi 	 day 	 s 	 	next	year	.	``
it	's	funny	,	is	n't	it	?	it	's	funny	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	kind	of	waft	 in 	 to 	 	your	head	.
and	of	course	--	--	and	of	course	,	if	the	piece	is	long	and	you	've	had	a	long	day	,	you	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	drift	off	.
then	your	companion	will	dig	you	in	the	 rib 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	wake	up	!	it	's	culture	!	``	and	then	you	feel	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
but	 ha 	 s 	 	it	ever	 occur 	 red 	 	to	you	that	the	reason	you	feel	 sleep 	 y 	 	in	 classic 	 al 	 	music	is	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	you	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	us	?
did	 any 	 body 	 	think	while	i	was	 play 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	is	he	using	so	 man 	 y 	 	 impulse 	 s 	 	?	``
if	i	'd	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	my	head	you	 certain 	 ly 	 	would	have	thought	it	.
and	for	the	rest	of	your	life	,	every	time	you	hear	 classic 	 al 	 	music	,	you	'll	 al 	 ways 	 	be	able	to	know	if	you	hear	 t 	 hose 	 	 impulse 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	see	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	here	.
we	have	a	b.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	b.	the	next	note	is	a	c	.
and	the	job	of	the	c	is	to	make	the	b	 s 	 ad 	 	.	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	?
 compose 	 rs 	 	know	that	.	if	they	want	 s 	 ad 	 	music	,	they	just	play	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 note 	 s 	 	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	it	's	just	a	b	,	with	four	 s 	 ad 	 s 	 	.
now	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	down	to	a.	now	to	g.	and	then	to	f	.
so	we	have	b	,	a	,	g	,	f.	and	if	we	have	b	,	a	,	g	,	f	,	what	do	we	expect	next	?	oh	,	that	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	 flu 	 ke 	 	.
let	's	try	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.	ooh	,	the	ted	choir	.
and	you	notice	 no 	 body 	 	is	tone	-	deaf	,	right	?	 no 	 body 	 	is	.
you	know	,	every	village	in	bangladesh	and	every	 ham 	 let 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	--	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	:	da	,	da	,	da	,	da	--	da	.	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	who	's	 expect 	 ing 	 	that	e	.
now	,	chopin	did	n't	want	to	reach	the	e	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	will	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	it	will	be	over	,	like	 ham 	 let 	 	.
do	you	remember	 ham 	 let 	 	?	act	one	,	scene	three	,	he	 find 	 s 	 	out	that	his	uncle	 kill 	 ed 	 	his	father	.
you	remember	,	he	 keep 	 s 	 	on	going	up	to	his	uncle	and	 al 	 most 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	him	.	and	then	he	 back 	 s 	 	away	,	and	he	 go 	 es 	 	up	to	him	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 al 	 most 	 	 kill 	 s 	 	him	.
and	the	 critic 	 s 	 	,	all	of	whom	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	back	row	there	,	they	have	to	have	an	opinion	,	so	they	say	,	``	 ham 	 let 	 	is	a	 procrastin 	 ator 	 	.	``
or	they	say	,	``	 ham 	 let 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	oedipus	complex	.	``
no	,	 other 	 wise 	 	the	play	would	be	over	,	stupid	.
that	's	why	shakespeare	 put 	 s 	 	all	that	stuff	in	 ham 	 let 	 	--	you	know	,	ophelia	going	mad	and	the	play	 with 	 in 	 	the	play	,	and	yorick	's	skull	,	and	the	 grave 	 dig 	 gers 	 	.
that	's	in	order	to	delay	--	 un 	 til 	 	act	five	,	he	can	kill	him	.
it	's	the	same	with	the	chopin	.	he	's	just	about	to	reach	the	e	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 oop 	 s 	 	,	better	go	back	up	and	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
so	he	 do 	 es 	 	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
now	,	he	 get 	 s 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	that	's	 excit 	 ement 	 	,	you	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	it	.
now	,	he	 get 	 s 	 	to	f	-	sharp	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	he	 go 	 es 	 	down	to	e	,	but	it	's	the	wrong	 chor 	 d 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 chor 	 d 	 	he	's	looking	for	is	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	...
now	,	we	call	that	a	deceptive	 cad 	 ence 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 deceive 	 s 	 	us	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	tell	my	 student 	 s 	 	,	``	if	you	have	a	deceptive	 cad 	 ence 	 	,	be	 s 	 ure 	 	to	raise	your	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	.	then	 every 	 body 	 	will	know	.	``
right	.	so	,	he	 get 	 s 	 	to	e	,	but	it	's	the	wrong	 chor 	 d 	 	.
now	,	he	tries	e	 aga 	 in 	 	.	that	 chor 	 d 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
now	,	he	tries	the	e	 aga 	 in 	 	.	that	 chor 	 d 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
now	,	he	tries	e	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	...
there	was	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	in	the	front	row	who	went	,	``	mmm	.	``
it	's	the	same	 gest 	 ure 	 	he	 make 	 s 	 	when	he	 come 	 s 	 	home	after	a	long	day	,	 turn 	 s 	 	off	the	key	in	his	car	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	aah	,	i	'm	home	.	``	 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	know	where	home	is	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	piece	which	 go 	 es 	 	from	away	to	home	.
and	i	'm	going	to	play	it	all	the	way	through	and	you	're	going	to	follow	.	b	,	c	,	b	,	c	,	b	,	c	,	b	--	down	to	a	,	down	to	g	,	down	to	f	.
 al 	 most 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	e	,	but	 other 	 wise 	 	the	play	would	be	over	.
he	 go 	 es 	 	back	up	to	b.	he	 get 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	 go 	 es 	 	to	f	-	sharp	.	 go 	 es 	 	to	e	.
it	's	the	wrong	 chor 	 d 	 	.	it	's	the	wrong	 chor 	 d 	 	.	it	's	the	wrong	 chor 	 d 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	e	,	and	it	's	home	.
and	what	you	're	going	to	see	is	one	-	buttock	 play 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	for	me	,	to	join	the	b	to	the	e	,	i	have	to	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	about	every	single	note	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	,	and	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	long	,	long	line	from	b	to	e	.
you	know	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	in	south	africa	,	and	you	ca	n't	go	to	south	africa	 with 	 out 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	mandela	in	jail	for	27	 year 	 s 	 	.
what	was	he	 think 	 ing 	 	about	?	lunch	?
no	,	he	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	vision	for	south	africa	and	for	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	that	's	what	 ke 	 pt 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	vision	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	the	long	line	.
like	the	bird	who	flies	over	the	field	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	about	the	 f 	 ence 	 s 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	,	all	right	?
so	now	,	you	're	going	to	follow	the	line	all	the	way	from	b	to	e	.
and	i	've	one	last	request	before	i	play	 th 	 is 	 	piece	all	the	way	through	.
would	you	think	of	 some 	 body 	 	who	you	 ador 	 e 	 	,	who	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	there	?
a	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	a	lover	--	 some 	 body 	 	in	your	life	who	you	love	with	all	your	heart	,	but	that	person	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	with	you	.
 br 	 ing 	 	that	person	 in 	 to 	 	your	mind	,	and	at	the	same	time	follow	the	line	all	the	way	from	b	to	e	,	and	you	'll	hear	 every 	 thing 	 	that	chopin	had	to	say	.
now	,	you	may	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	you	may	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	why	i	'm	 clap 	 ping 	 	.
well	,	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	at	a	school	in	boston	with	about	70	 seven 	 th 	 	graders	,	12	-	year	-	olds	.
and	i	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	did	with	you	,	and	i	told	them	and	 explain 	 ed 	 	them	and	the	whole	thing	.
and	at	the	end	,	they	went	crazy	,	 clap 	 ping 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 clap 	 ping 	 	.
i	was	 clap 	 ping 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 clap 	 ping 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	am	i	 clap 	 ping 	 	?	``
and	one	of	the	little	 kid 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	.	``
think	of	it	.	1,600	people	,	 bus 	 y 	 	people	,	 involve 	 d 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 move 	 d 	 	by	a	piece	by	chopin	.
now	that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	.
now	,	am	i	 s 	 ure 	 	that	every	single	person	 follow 	 ed 	 	that	,	 under 	 stood 	 	it	,	was	 move 	 d 	 	by	it	?	of	course	,	i	ca	n't	be	 s 	 ure 	 	.
but	i	tell	you	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
i	was	in	ireland	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 trouble 	 s 	 	,	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	some	catholic	and	protestant	 kid 	 s 	 	on	conflict	 re 	 solution 	 	.	and	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	with	them	--	a	 risk 	 y 	 	thing	to	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	street	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	them	came	to	me	the	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	've	never	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	 classic 	 al 	 	music	in	my	life	,	but	when	you	 play 	 ed 	 	that	 shop 	 ping 	 	piece	...	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	brother	was	shot	last	year	and	i	did	n't	cry	for	him	.
but	last	night	,	when	you	 play 	 ed 	 	that	piece	,	he	was	the	one	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
and	i	felt	the	 tear 	 s 	 	 stream 	 ing 	 	down	my	face	.
and	you	know	,	it	felt	 re 	 ally 	 	good	to	cry	for	my	brother	.	``
so	i	made	up	my	mind	at	that	moment	that	 classic 	 al 	 	music	is	for	 every 	 body 	 	.	 every 	 body 	 	.
now	,	how	would	you	walk	--	 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	,	my	profession	,	the	music	profession	 do 	 es 	 	n't	see	it	that	way	.
they	say	three	percent	of	the	population	 like 	 s 	 	 classic 	 al 	 	music	.
if	 on 	 ly 	 	we	could	move	it	to	four	percent	,	our	 problem 	 s 	 	would	be	over	.
i	say	,	``	how	would	you	walk	?	how	would	you	talk	?	how	would	you	be	?
if	you	thought	,	three	percent	of	the	population	 like 	 s 	 	 classic 	 al 	 	music	,	if	 on 	 ly 	 	we	could	move	it	to	four	percent	.	how	would	you	walk	?
how	would	you	talk	?	how	would	you	be	?
if	you	thought	,	 every 	 body 	 	 love 	 s 	 	 classic 	 al 	 	music	--	they	just	have	n't	found	out	about	it	yet	.	``
see	,	these	are	 total 	 ly 	 	different	 world 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	had	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	experience	.	i	was	45	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 sudden 	 ly 	 	had	a	 real 	 ization 	 	.
the	conductor	of	an	orchestra	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	a	sound	.
my	picture	 appear 	 s 	 	on	the	front	of	the	cd	--	--	but	the	conductor	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	a	sound	.
he	 depend 	 s 	 	,	for	his	power	,	on	his	ability	to	make	other	people	 power 	 ful 	 	.
and	that	 change 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	for	me	.	it	was	 total 	 ly 	 	life	changing	.
people	in	my	orchestra	came	up	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ben	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	``	that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	my	job	was	to	 awake 	 n 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	in	other	people	.
and	of	course	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	 whet 	 her 	 	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
and	you	know	how	you	find	out	?	you	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
if	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 shin 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
you	could	light	up	a	village	with	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	 eye 	 s 	 	.
right	.	so	if	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 shin 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
if	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	not	 shin 	 ing 	 	,	you	get	to	ask	a	question	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	question	:	who	am	i	 be 	 ing 	 	,	that	my	 player 	 s 	 	'	 eye 	 s 	 	are	not	 shin 	 ing 	 	?
we	can	do	that	with	our	children	,	too	.
who	am	i	 be 	 ing 	 	,	that	my	children	's	 eye 	 s 	 	are	not	 shin 	 ing 	 	?
that	's	a	 total 	 ly 	 	different	world	.
now	,	we	're	all	about	to	end	 th 	 is 	 	 magic 	 al 	 	,	on	-	the	-	mountain	week	,	and	we	're	going	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	.
and	i	say	,	it	's	appropriate	for	us	to	ask	the	question	,	who	are	we	 be 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	back	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	?
and	you	know	,	i	have	a	definition	of	success	.
for	me	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.	it	's	not	about	wealth	and	fame	and	power	.
it	's	about	how	 man 	 y 	 	 shin 	 ing 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	i	have	around	me	.
so	now	,	i	have	one	last	thought	,	which	is	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	what	we	say	--	the	 word 	 s 	 	that	come	out	of	our	mouth	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	from	a	woman	who	 surviv 	 ed 	 	auschwitz	,	one	of	the	rare	 surviv 	 ors 	 	.
she	went	to	auschwitz	when	she	was	15	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	her	brother	was	eight	,	and	the	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	lost	.
and	she	told	me	 th 	 is 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	train	going	to	auschwitz	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	down	and	saw	my	brother	's	 shoe 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	'	why	are	you	so	stupid	,	ca	n't	you	keep	your	 thing 	 s 	 	together	for	 good 	 ness 	 	'	sake	?	'	``	the	way	an	elder	sister	might	speak	to	a	 young 	 er 	 	brother	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	the	last	thing	she	ever	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	never	saw	him	 aga 	 in 	 	.	he	did	not	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
and	so	when	she	came	out	of	auschwitz	,	she	made	a	vow	.
she	told	me	 th 	 is 	 	.	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	of	auschwitz	 in 	 to 	 	life	and	i	made	a	vow	.	and	the	vow	was	,	i	will	never	say	 any 	 thing 	 	that	could	n't	stand	 a 	 s 	 	the	last	thing	i	ever	say	.	``
now	,	can	we	do	that	?	no	.	and	we	'll	make	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	wrong	and	 other 	 s 	 	wrong	.	but	it	is	a	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	live	 in 	 to 	 	.	thank	you	.
 shin 	 ing 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	 shin 	 ing 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	,	thank	you	.
