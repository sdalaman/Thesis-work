hi	there	.	i	'm	hasan	.	i	'm	an	artist	.
and	 usual 	 ly 	 	when	i	tell	people	i	'm	an	artist	,	they	just	look	at	me	and	say	,	``	do	you	paint	?	``
or	``	what	kind	of	medium	do	you	work	in	?	``
well	most	of	my	work	that	i	work	with	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	little	bit	about	 method 	 o 	 logies 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	specific	discipline	or	a	specific	 techni 	 que 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	creative	problem	solving	.
and	i	had	a	little	bit	of	a	problem	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	let	me	show	you	a	little	of	that	.
so	it	 start 	 ed 	 	over	here	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	detroit	 air 	 port 	 	in	june	19th	of	2002	.
i	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	back	to	the	u.s.	from	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	coming	back	,	well	i	was	taken	by	the	fbi	,	met	by	an	fbi	agent	,	and	went	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	room	and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	--	``	where	 we 	 re 	 	you	?	what	 we 	 re 	 	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	who	 we 	 re 	 	you	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	?
why	 we 	 re 	 	you	there	?	who	 pay 	 s 	 	for	your	 trip 	 s 	 	?	``	--	all	these	little	 detail 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 liter 	 ally 	 	just	out	of	 no 	 where 	 	,	the	guy	 ask 	 s 	 	me	,	``	where	 we 	 re 	 	you	september	12th	?	``
and	when	most	of	us	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	where	 we 	 re 	 	you	september	12th	?	``
or	any	date	for	that	fact	,	it	's	like	,	``	i	do	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	remember	,	but	i	can	look	it	up	for	you	.	``
so	i	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	my	little	pda	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	let	's	look	up	my	 appointment 	 s 	 	for	september	12th	.	``
i	had	september	12th	--	from	10:00	 a.m 	 . 	 	to	10:30	 a.m 	 . 	 	,	i	paid	my	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	bill	.
from	10:30	 a.m 	 . 	 	to	12:00	 p.m 	 . 	 	,	i	met	with	judith	who	was	one	of	my	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	at	the	time	.
from	12:00	 p.m 	 . 	 	to	3:00	 p.m 	 . 	 	,	i	taught	my	intro	class	,	3:00	 p.m 	 . 	 	to	6:00	 p.m 	 . 	 	,	i	taught	my	 advance 	 d 	 	class	.
``	where	 we 	 re 	 	you	the	11th	?	``	``	where	 we 	 re 	 	you	the	10th	?	``
``	where	 we 	 re 	 	you	the	29th	?	the	30th	?	``
``	where	 we 	 re 	 	you	october	5th	?	``
we	read	about	six	 month 	 s 	 	of	my	calendar	.
and	i	do	n't	think	he	was	 expect 	 ing 	 	me	to	have	 s 	 uch 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	 record 	 s 	 	of	what	i	did	.
but	good	thing	i	did	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	look	good	in	 o 	 range 	 	.
so	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	--	``	so	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	unit	that	you	paid	the	rent	on	,	what	did	you	have	in	it	?	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	in	tampa	,	florida	,	so	i	was	like	,	``	winter	 clothe 	 s 	 	that	i	have	no	use	for	in	florida	.
furniture	that	i	ca	n't	fit	in	my	 rat 	 ty 	 	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
just	 assort 	 ed 	 	 gar 	 age 	 	sale	junk	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	a	pack	rat	.	``
and	he	 look 	 s 	 	at	me	 re 	 ally 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	no	 explosive 	 s 	 	?	``
i	was	like	,	``	no	,	no	.	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	certain	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 explosive 	 s 	 	.
and	if	there	 we 	 re 	 	,	i	would	have	 remember 	 ed 	 	that	one	.	``
and	he	's	still	a	little	 con 	 fused 	 	,	but	i	think	that	 any 	 one 	 	who	 talk 	 s 	 	to	me	for	more	than	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	i	'm	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	a	terrorist	threat	.
and	so	we	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	after	about	an	hour	,	hour	and	a	half	of	just	going	back	and	forth	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	have	 en 	 ough 	 	information	here	.
i	'm	going	to	pass	 th 	 is 	 	onto	the	tampa	 off 	 ice 	 	.	they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	 initi 	 ated 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	'll	follow	up	with	you	,	and	we	'll	take	care	of	it	.	``
i	was	like	,	``	great	.	``
so	i	got	home	and	the	phone	 ring 	 s 	 	,	and	a	man	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	fbi	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	in	tampa	where	i	 s 	 pent 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	of	my	life	--	back	and	forth	,	not	six	 month 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ously 	 	.
by	the	way	,	you	 folk 	 s 	 	know	that	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	you	ca	n't	take	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	federal	 building 	 s 	 	,	but	google	can	do	it	for	you	.
so	to	the	 folk 	 s 	 	from	google	,	thank	you	.
so	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	.
 question 	 s 	 	like	:	``	have	you	ever	 witness 	 ed 	 	or	 particip 	 ated 	 	in	any	act	that	may	be	 detri 	 mental 	 	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	or	a	foreign	nation	?	``
and	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	consider	the	state	of	mind	you	're	in	when	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	face	-	to	-	face	with	 some 	 one 	 	that	 essential 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 s 	 	life	or	death	.
or	 question 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 poly 	 graph 	 	,	which	was	how	it	 final 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	after	nine	 con 	 s 	 ecutive 	 	of	them	--	one	of	the	 poly 	 graph 	 	 question 	 s 	 	was	...
well	the	first	one	was	,	``	is	your	name	hasan	?	``	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
``	are	we	in	florida	?	``	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``	``	is	 to 	 day 	 	tuesday	?	``	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	base	it	on	a	 y 	 es 	 	or	no	.
then	,	of	course	,	the	next	question	is	:	``	do	you	belong	to	any	 group 	 s 	 	that	wish	to	harm	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	?	``
i	work	at	a	university	.
so	i	was	like	,	``	 may 	 be 	 	you	want	to	ask	some	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	that	 direct 	 ly 	 	.	``
but	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 a 	 side 	 	from	what	we	had	 discuss 	 ed 	 	,	do	you	belong	to	any	 group 	 s 	 	that	wish	to	harm	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	?	``
i	was	like	,	``	no.	``
so	at	the	end	of	six	 month 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	nine	 con 	 s 	 ecutive 	 	 poly 	 graph 	 s 	 	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	's	fine	.	``
i	was	like	,	``	i	know	.	that	's	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	you	 guy 	 s 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	.
i	know	 every 	 thing 	 	's	fine	.	``
so	they	're	looking	at	me	 re 	 ally 	 	odd	.
and	it	's	like	,	``	 guy 	 s 	 	,	i	travel	a	lot	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	with	the	fbi	.
and	i	was	like	,	``	all	we	need	is	alaska	not	to	get	the	last	memo	,	and	here	we	go	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
and	there	was	a	 since 	 re 	 	concern	there	.
and	he	was	like	,	``	you	know	,	if	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	trouble	,	give	us	a	call	--	we	'll	take	care	of	it	.	``
so	ever	since	then	,	before	i	would	go	 any 	 where 	 	,	i	would	call	the	fbi	.
i	would	tell	them	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	'm	going	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	flight	.
 north 	 west 	 	flight	seven	coming	 in 	 to 	 	seattle	on	march	12th	``	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
a	couple	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	'd	call	 aga 	 in 	 	,	let	them	know	.
it	was	n't	that	i	had	to	,	but	i	chose	to	.
just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	.
do	n't	want	to	make	it	look	like	i	'm	making	any	sudden	 move 	 s 	 	.	``
``	i	do	n't	want	you	 guy 	 s 	 	to	think	that	i	'm	about	to	flee	.
just	 lett 	 ing 	 	you	know	.	 head 	 s 	 	up	.	``
and	so	i	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	over	and	over	and	over	.
and	then	the	phone	 call 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 email 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 email 	 s 	 	got	 long 	 er 	 	and	 long 	 er 	 	and	 long 	 er 	 	...
with	 picture 	 s 	 	,	with	travel	 tip 	 s 	 	.
then	i	'd	make	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	.
and	then	i	built	 th 	 is 	 	over	here	.	let	me	go	back	to	it	over	here	.
so	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	designed	 th 	 is 	 	back	in	2003	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 track 	 s 	 	me	at	any	 give 	 n 	 	moment	.
i	wrote	some	code	for	my	mobile	phone	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	what	i	 decide 	 d 	 	is	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	you	want	to	watch	me	,	that	's	cool	.
but	i	'll	watch	 my 	 self 	 	.	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
you	do	n't	have	to	waste	your	energy	or	your	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'll	help	you	out	.
so	in	the	process	,	i	start	 think 	 ing 	 	,	well	what	else	might	they	know	about	me	?
well	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	all	my	flight	 record 	 s 	 	,	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	put	all	my	flight	 record 	 s 	 	from	birth	 on 	 line 	 	.
so	you	can	see	,	 del 	 ta 	 	1252	going	from	kansas	city	to	atlanta	.
and	then	you	see	,	these	are	some	of	the	 meal 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	fed	on	the	 plane 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	on	 del 	 ta 	 	719	going	from	jfk	to	san	francisco	.
see	that	?	they	wo	n't	let	me	on	a	plane	with	that	,	but	they	'll	give	it	to	me	on	the	plane	.
these	are	the	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	that	i	hang	out	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	like	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	.
that	's	kennedy	 air 	 port 	 	,	may	19th	,	tuesday	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	warsaw	.
singapore	.	you	can	see	,	they	're	kind	of	empty	.
these	 image 	 s 	 	are	shot	 re 	 ally 	 	 anonym 	 ously 	 	to	the	point	where	it	could	be	 any 	 one 	 	.
but	if	you	can	cross	-	 re 	 ference 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	other	data	,	then	you	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 re 	 play 	 ing 	 	the	roll	of	the	fbi	agent	and	 put 	 ting 	 	it	all	together	.
and	when	you	're	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	you	have	to	 just 	 ify 	 	every	moment	of	your	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	you	're	put	in	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	you	react	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	manner	.
at	the	time	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	going	on	,	the	last	thing	on	my	mind	was	``	art	project	.	``
i	was	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	got	new	work	here	.
but	after	going	through	 th 	 is 	 	,	after	 real 	 izing 	 	,	well	what	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
and	after	 pie 	 c 	 ing 	 	together	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	way	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	for	 my 	 self 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
so	these	are	the	 store 	 s 	 	that	i	shop	in	--	some	of	them	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	need	to	know	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	me	 buy 	 ing 	 	some	duck	 flavor 	 ed 	 	paste	at	the	ranch	99	in	daly	city	on	sunday	,	november	15th	.
at	coreana	 super 	 market 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	my	kimchi	 be 	 cause 	 	i	like	kimchi	.
and	i	 b 	 ought 	 	some	 crab 	 s 	 	too	right	around	there	,	and	some	 ch 	 it 	 lin 	 s 	 	at	the	safeway	in	emoryville	.
and	 laundr 	 y 	 	too	.	 laundr 	 y 	 	detergent	at	west	oakland	--	east	oakland	,	sorry	.
and	then	my	 pick 	 led 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	at	the	hong	kong	 super 	 market 	 	on	route	18	in	east	brunswick	.
now	if	you	go	to	my	bank	 record 	 s 	 	,	it	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	show	 some 	 thing 	 	from	there	,	so	you	know	that	,	on	may	9th	,	that	i	 b 	 ought 	 	$	14.79	in	fuel	from	safeway	vallejo	.
so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	i	'm	giving	 th 	 is 	 	information	here	and	there	,	but	now	there	's	a	third	party	,	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	third	party	,	my	bank	,	that	's	 ver 	 ifying 	 	that	,	 y 	 es 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	i	was	there	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
so	there	's	 point 	 s 	 	,	and	these	 point 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	cross	-	 re 	 ference 	 d 	 	.
and	there	's	a	 ver 	 ification 	 	taking	place	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	small	 purchase 	 s 	 	.
so	34	 cent 	 s 	 	foreign	 trans 	 action 	 	fee	.
all	of	these	are	 extra 	 cted 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	from	my	bank	 account 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 pop 	 s 	 	up	right	away	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	information	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	my	old	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	in	san	francisco	was	.
and	then	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	just	get	 th 	 is 	 	,	just	an	empty	 hall 	 way 	 	in	salt	lake	city	,	january	22nd	.
and	i	can	tell	you	 exact 	 ly 	 	who	i	was	with	,	where	i	was	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	had	to	do	with	the	fbi	.
i	had	to	tell	them	every	little	detail	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	on	the	road	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	in	elko	,	nevada	off	of	route	80	at	8:01	 p.m 	 . 	 	on	august	19th	.
i	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	gas	 station 	 s 	 	too	--	empty	train	 station 	 s 	 	.
so	there	's	 multi 	 ple 	 	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	46,000	 image 	 s 	 	right	now	on	my	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	the	fbi	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	all	of	them	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	trust	they	've	 s 	 een 	 	all	of	them	.
and	then	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	get	much	information	at	all	,	you	just	get	 th 	 is 	 	empty	bed	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	get	a	lot	of	text	information	and	no	visual	information	.
so	you	get	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	by	the	way	,	is	the	location	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	sandwich	shop	in	california	--	vietnamese	sandwich	.
so	there	's	different	 categor 	 ization 	 s 	 	of	 meal 	 s 	 	eaten	 out 	 side 	 	empty	train	 station 	 s 	 	,	empty	gas	 station 	 s 	 	.
these	are	some	of	the	 meal 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 cook 	 ing 	 	at	home	.
so	how	do	you	know	these	are	 meal 	 s 	 	eaten	at	home	?
well	the	same	plate	 show 	 s 	 	up	a	whole	bunch	of	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	have	to	do	some	 detect 	 ive 	 	work	here	.
so	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	get	so	specific	.
these	are	all	 ta 	 co 	 s 	 	eaten	in	mexico	city	near	a	train	station	on	july	fifth	to	july	sixth	.
at	11:39	 a.m 	 . 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
at	1:56	 p.m 	 . 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	one	.	at	4:59	 p.m 	 . 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
so	i	time	-	stamp	my	life	every	few	 moment 	 s 	 	.
every	few	 moment 	 s 	 	i	shoot	the	image	.
now	it	's	all	 d 	 one 	 	on	my	iphone	,	and	it	all	 go 	 es 	 	straight	up	to	my	 serv 	 er 	 	,	and	my	 serv 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	all	the	 back 	 end 	 	work	and	 categor 	 ize 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 put 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	together	.
they	need	to	know	where	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	my	business	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	to	know	about	my	business	.
so	on	december	4th	,	i	went	here	.
and	on	sunday	,	june	14th	at	2009	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	two	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	afternoon	in	skowhegan	,	maine	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	there	.
so	what	you	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	all	bits	and	 piece 	 s 	 	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	information	.
if	you	go	to	my	 s 	 ite 	 	,	there	's	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	not	the	most	user	-	friendly	 inter 	 face 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	user	-	unfriendly	.
and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	part	of	the	user	-	unfriendliness	,	is	that	 every 	 thing 	 	is	there	,	but	you	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	work	through	it	.
so	by	me	 put 	 ting 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	information	out	there	,	what	i	'm	 bas 	 ically 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	is	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 every 	 thing 	 	.
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	 bar 	 rage 	 	of	noise	that	i	'm	 put 	 ting 	 	out	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	live	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 anonym 	 ous 	 	and	private	life	.
and	you	know	 ver 	 y 	 	little	about	me	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	so	i	've	come	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	the	way	you	protect	your	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	an	era	where	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 catalog 	 ed 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 archiv 	 ed 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 record 	 ed 	 	,	there	's	no	need	to	delete	information	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	what	do	you	do	when	 every 	 thing 	 	is	out	there	?
well	you	have	to	take	control	over	it	.
and	if	i	give	you	 th 	 is 	 	information	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	type	of	 ident 	 ity 	 	than	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	try	to	go	through	and	try	to	get	bits	and	 piece 	 s 	 	.
the	other	thing	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	's	going	on	here	is	the	fact	that	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 age 	 ncies 	 	--	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	who	they	are	--	they	all	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	an	industry	where	 the 	 ir 	 	 commodit 	 y 	 	is	information	,	or	 restrict 	 ed 	 	access	to	information	.
and	the	reason	 the 	 ir 	 	information	 ha 	 s 	 	any	value	is	,	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	no	one	else	 ha 	 s 	 	access	to	it	.
and	by	me	cutting	out	the	middle	man	and	giving	it	straight	to	you	,	the	information	that	the	fbi	 ha 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	no	value	,	so	thus	 d 	 evalu 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 curr 	 ency 	 	.
and	i	understand	that	,	on	an	individual	level	,	it	's	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	 symbol 	 ic 	 	.
but	if	300	million	people	in	the	u.s	.
 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	would	have	to	 re 	 design 	 	the	entire	 intellig 	 ence 	 	system	from	the	ground	up	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	just	would	n't	work	if	 every 	 body 	 	was	sharing	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	to	that	.
when	i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	me	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	would	you	want	to	tell	 every 	 body 	 	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	where	you	're	at	?
why	are	you	 post 	 ing 	 	these	 photo 	 s 	 	?	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	age	before	people	 we 	 re 	 	 tweet 	 ing 	 	 every 	 where 	 	and	750	million	people	 we 	 re 	 	 post 	 ing 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	or	 po 	 king 	 	people	.
so	in	a	way	,	i	'm	glad	that	i	'm	 complete 	 ly 	 	 obsolet 	 e 	 	.
i	'm	still	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	but	it	is	 obsolet 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	all	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	all	are	 do 	 ing 	 	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	aware	of	it	or	not	.
so	we	're	creating	our	own	 archiv 	 es 	 	and	so	on	.
and	you	know	,	some	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	're	just	 para 	 n 	 oid 	 	.	why	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	no	one	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	.
no	one	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	 both 	 er 	 	you	.	``
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	do	is	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	through	my	 serv 	 er 	 	 log 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	about	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	.
i	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	who	's	 watch 	 ing 	 	me	.
and	i	came	up	with	these	.
so	these	are	some	of	my	 s 	 ample 	 	 log 	 s 	 	.
and	just	little	bits	and	 piece 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	see	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	there	.
and	i	 clean 	 ed 	 	up	the	list	a	little	bit	so	you	can	see	.
so	you	can	see	that	the	 home 	 land 	 	security	 like 	 s 	 	to	come	by	--	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	 home 	 land 	 	security	.
you	can	see	the	national	security	 age 	 ncy 	 	 like 	 s 	 	to	come	by	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 move 	 d 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	them	.	i	live	right	down	the	street	from	them	now	.
central	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	.
 ex 	 ecutive 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	of	the	 p 	 resident 	 	.
not	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	why	they	show	up	,	but	they	do	.
i	think	they	kind	of	like	to	look	at	art	.
and	i	'm	glad	that	we	have	 patron 	 s 	 	of	the	 art 	 s 	 	in	these	 field 	 s 	 	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	i	appreciate	it	.
bruno	giussani	:	hasan	,	just	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	now	 every 	 thing 	 	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 go 	 es 	 	from	my	iphone	,	``	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	you	do	take	the	 picture 	 s 	 	and	put	on	information	.
so	how	 man 	 y 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	of	the	day	 do 	 es 	 	that	take	?
he	:	 al 	 most 	 	 non 	 e 	 	.
it	's	no	different	than	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	text	.
it	's	no	different	than	 check 	 ing 	 	an	email	.
it	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	got	by	just	fine	before	we	had	to	do	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
so	it	's	just	 be 	 come 	 	 an 	 other 	 	day	.
i	mean	,	when	we	update	a	 stat 	 us 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	how	long	that	's	going	to	take	.
so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	just	a	matter	of	my	phone	 click 	 ing 	 	a	couple	of	 click 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 end 	 	,	and	then	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	's	 autom 	 ated 	 	at	the	other	end	.
bg	:	on	the	day	you	are	in	a	place	where	there	is	no	 cover 	 age 	 	,	the	fbi	 get 	 s 	 	crazy	?
he	:	well	it	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	last	point	that	i	was	at	.
so	it	 hold 	 s 	 	onto	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	point	.
so	if	i	'm	on	a	12	-	hour	flight	,	you	'll	see	the	last	 air 	 port 	 	that	i	 depart 	 ed 	 	from	.
bg	:	hasan	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
