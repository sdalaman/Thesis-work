 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	go	 brow 	 s 	 ing 	 	[	through	]	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	magazine	.
i	found	 th 	 is 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	test	about	the	story	of	the	ark	.
and	the	artist	that	drew	 th 	 is 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	test	did	some	 error 	 s 	 	,	had	some	 mistak 	 es 	 	--	there	are	more	or	less	12	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
some	of	them	are	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	.
there	is	a	funnel	,	an	 a 	 erial 	 	part	,	a	lamp	and	 clock 	 work 	 	key	on	the	ark	.
some	of	them	are	about	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	the	number	.
but	there	is	a	much	more	fundamental	 mistak 	 e 	 	in	the	 over 	 all 	 	story	of	the	ark	that	's	not	 report 	 ed 	 	here	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	problem	is	:	where	are	the	 plant 	 s 	 	?
so	now	we	have	god	that	is	going	to	 sub 	 merge 	 	earth	 permanent 	 ly 	 	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	period	,	and	no	one	is	taking	care	of	 plant 	 s 	 	.
noah	 need 	 ed 	 	to	take	two	of	every	kind	of	bird	,	of	every	kind	of	animal	,	of	every	kind	of	creature	that	 move 	 s 	 	,	but	no	 ment 	 ion 	 	about	 plant 	 s 	 	.
why	?
in	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	same	story	,	all	the	living	 creature 	 s 	 	are	just	the	living	 creature 	 s 	 	that	came	out	from	the	ark	,	so	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 live 	 stock 	 	and	wild	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 plant 	 s 	 	are	not	living	 creature 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	point	.
that	is	a	point	that	is	not	coming	out	from	the	 b 	 ible 	 	,	but	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 accompani 	 ed 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	.
let	's	have	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	nice	code	that	is	coming	from	a	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	book	.
here	we	have	the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	order	of	nature	.
it	's	a	nice	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	from	left	--	you	have	the	 stone 	 s 	 	--	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	after	the	 stone 	 s 	 	,	the	 plant 	 s 	 	that	are	just	able	to	live	.
we	have	the	 animal 	 s 	 	that	are	able	to	live	and	to	sense	,	and	on	the	top	of	the	pyramid	,	there	is	the	man	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	common	man	.
the	``	homo	 studio 	 s 	 us 	 	``	--	the	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	man	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 comfort 	 ing 	 	for	people	like	me	--	i	'm	a	professor	--	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	over	there	on	the	top	of	creation	.
but	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
you	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	about	 professor 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	wrong	about	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	are	not	just	able	to	live	;	they	are	able	to	sense	.
they	are	much	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	in	 sens 	 ing 	 	than	 animal 	 s 	 	.
just	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	every	single	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	is	able	to	detect	and	to	monitor	 con 	 current 	 ly 	 	and	 continu 	 ously 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	15	different	chemical	and	physical	 parameter 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 al 	 so 	 	are	able	to	show	and	to	exhibit	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	complex	behavior	that	can	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	just	with	the	term	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
well	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 under 	 estimation 	 	of	 plant 	 s 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 al 	 ways 	 	with	us	.
let	's	have	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	short	movie	now	.
we	have	david	attenborough	.
now	david	attenborough	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	plant	lover	;	he	did	some	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	about	plant	behavior	.
now	,	when	he	 speak 	 s 	 	about	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	correct	.
when	he	 speak 	 s 	 	about	 animal 	 s 	 	,	[	he	]	 tend 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	fact	that	 plant 	 s 	 	exist	.
the	blue	whale	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	creature	that	 exist 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	--	that	is	wrong	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
the	blue	whale	,	it	's	a	dwarf	if	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	the	real	 big 	 gest 	 	creature	that	 exist 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	--	that	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 magnific 	 ent 	 	sequoiadendron	 giga 	 nte 	 um 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	living	organism	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mass	of	at	 l 	 east 	 	2,000	 ton 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	story	that	 plant 	 s 	 	are	some	low	-	level	 organism 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 form 	 al 	 ized 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	ago	by	aristotle	,	that	in	``	de	anima	``	--	that	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	book	for	the	western	 civil 	 ization 	 	--	wrote	that	the	 plant 	 s 	 	are	on	the	edge	between	living	and	not	living	.
they	have	just	a	kind	of	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	level	soul	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 veget 	 ative 	 	soul	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	lack	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	so	they	do	n't	need	to	sense	.
let	's	see	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	some	of	the	 move 	 ments 	 	of	the	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	known	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dionaea	,	a	venus	fly	trap	 hunt 	 ing 	 	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	--	sorry	for	the	 s 	 nail 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 fused 	 	for	centuries	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	evidence	.
no	one	can	say	that	the	 plant 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	eat	an	animal	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	against	the	order	of	nature	.
but	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	able	to	show	a	lot	of	 move 	 ment 	 	.
some	of	them	are	 ver 	 y 	 	well	known	,	like	the	 flower 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	just	a	question	to	use	some	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	like	the	time	lapse	.
some	of	them	are	much	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	young	bean	that	is	moving	to	catch	the	light	every	time	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	so	 grace 	 ful 	 	;	it	's	like	a	 danc 	 ing 	 	angel	.
they	are	 al 	 so 	 	able	to	play	--	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	.
these	are	young	 s 	 un 	 flower 	 s 	 	,	and	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	can	not	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	with	any	other	 term 	 s 	 	than	 play 	 ing 	 	.
they	are	training	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	young	 animal 	 s 	 	do	,	to	the	adult	life	where	they	will	be	 call 	 ed 	 	to	track	the	 s 	 un 	 	all	the	day	.
they	are	able	to	respond	to	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	of	course	,	so	the	 shoot 	 s 	 	are	growing	against	the	vector	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	and	the	 root 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	vector	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
but	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	able	to	sleep	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	,	mimosa	 pu 	 dica 	 	.
so	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	night	,	they	curl	the	 leav 	 es 	 	and	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	you	have	the	 open 	 ing 	 	of	the	 leav 	 es 	 	--	there	is	much	more	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 sleep 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	,	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 conserv 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	the	same	in	 plant 	 s 	 	,	in	 insect 	 s 	 	and	in	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	so	if	you	need	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 sleep 	 ing 	 	problem	,	it	's	easy	to	 stud 	 y 	 	on	 plant 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	than	in	 animal 	 s 	 	and	it	's	much	more	easy	even	 ethic 	 ally 	 	.
it	's	a	kind	of	 veget 	 arian 	 	 experiment 	 ation 	 	.
 plant 	 s 	 	are	even	able	to	communicate	--	they	are	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 communicator 	 s 	 	.
they	communicate	with	other	 plant 	 s 	 	.
they	are	able	to	distinguish	kin	and	non	-	kin	.
they	communicate	with	 plant 	 s 	 	of	other	species	and	they	communicate	with	 animal 	 s 	 	by	producing	chemical	 volatil 	 es 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	.
now	with	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	issue	for	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	move	the	 poll 	 en 	 	from	one	flower	to	the	other	,	yet	they	can	not	move	from	one	flower	to	the	other	.
so	they	need	a	vector	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	vector	,	it	's	 normal 	 ly 	 	an	animal	.
 man 	 y 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	used	by	 plant 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 vector 	 s 	 	for	the	transport	of	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	,	but	not	just	 insect 	 s 	 	;	even	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 reptil 	 es 	 	,	and	 mammal 	 s 	 	like	 bat 	 s 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	are	 normal 	 ly 	 	used	for	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	of	the	 poll 	 en 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	serious	business	.
we	have	the	 plant 	 s 	 	that	are	giving	to	the	 animal 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	sweet	 sub 	 stance 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 energ 	 izing 	 	--	 hav 	 ing 	 	in	change	 th 	 is 	 	 transport 	 ation 	 	of	the	 poll 	 en 	 	.
but	some	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 manipul 	 ating 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	like	in	the	case	of	 orchid 	 s 	 	that	promise	 s 	 ex 	 	and	nectar	and	give	in	change	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	of	the	 poll 	 en 	 	.
now	,	there	is	a	big	problem	 be 	 hind 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	that	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	.
how	is	it	possible	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	brain	?
we	need	to	wait	 un 	 til 	 	1880	,	when	 th 	 is 	 	big	man	,	charles	darwin	,	 publish 	 es 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 astonish 	 ing 	 	book	that	 start 	 s 	 	a	revolution	.
the	title	is	``	the	power	of	 move 	 ment 	 	in	 plant 	 s 	 	.	``
no	one	was	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	speak	about	 move 	 ment 	 	in	 plant 	 s 	 	before	charles	darwin	.
in	his	book	,	 assist 	 ed 	 	by	his	son	,	francis	--	who	was	the	first	professor	of	plant	physiology	in	the	world	,	in	cambridge	--	they	took	 in 	 to 	 	 consider 	 ation 	 	every	single	 move 	 ment 	 	for	500	 page 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	last	 para 	 graph 	 	of	the	book	,	it	's	a	kind	of	 styl 	 istic 	 	mark	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	charles	darwin	 store 	 d 	 	,	in	the	last	 para 	 graph 	 	of	a	book	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	.
he	wrote	that	,	``	it	's	 hard 	 ly 	 	an	 exagge 	 ration 	 	to	say	that	the	tip	of	the	radical	 act 	 s 	 	like	the	brain	of	one	of	the	lower	 animal 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	metaphor	.
he	wrote	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	to	one	of	his	 friend 	 s 	 	who	was	j.d	.	 hook 	 er 	 	,	or	at	that	time	,	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	royal	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	so	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	scientific	 author 	 ity 	 	in	britain	 s 	 peaking 	 	about	the	brain	in	the	 plant 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	growing	against	a	 slop 	 e 	 	.
so	you	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	,	the	same	 move 	 ment 	 	that	 worm 	 s 	 	,	 snake 	 s 	 	and	every	animal	that	are	moving	on	the	ground	 with 	 out 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	is	able	to	 dis 	 play 	 	.
and	it	's	not	an	easy	 move 	 ment 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	,	you	need	to	move	different	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	root	and	to	 synchron 	 ize 	 	these	different	 region 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	brain	.
so	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	and	we	found	that	there	is	a	specific	region	that	is	here	,	 depict 	 ed 	 	in	blue	--	that	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	 transit 	 ion 	 	zone	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	region	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	region	--	it	's	less	than	one	millimeter	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	small	region	you	have	the	highest	consumption	of	oxygen	in	the	 plant 	 s 	 	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	you	have	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 signal 	 s 	 	here	.
the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	you	are	 see 	 ing 	 	here	are	action	potential	,	are	the	same	 signal 	 s 	 	that	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	of	my	brain	,	of	our	brain	,	use	to	 ex 	 change 	 	information	.
now	we	know	that	a	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	just	a	few	hundred	 cell 	 s 	 	that	show	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	feature	,	but	we	know	how	big	the	root	apparatus	of	a	small	plant	,	like	a	plant	of	 ry 	 e 	 	.
we	have	 al 	 most 	 	14	million	 root 	 s 	 	.
we	have	11	and	a	half	million	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	and	a	total	length	of	600	or	more	 kilometer 	 s 	 	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	surface	area	.
now	let	's	imagine	that	each	single	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	in	network	with	all	the	 other 	 s 	 	.
here	 we 	 re 	 	have	on	the	left	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	on	the	right	,	the	root	apparatus	.
they	work	in	the	same	way	.
they	are	a	network	of	small	computing	 machine 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 network 	 s 	 	.
and	why	are	they	so	similar	?
 be 	 cause 	 	they	 evolv 	 ed 	 	for	the	same	reason	:	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	 pre 	 d 	 ation 	 	.
they	work	in	the	same	way	.
so	you	can	 re 	 move 	 	90	percent	of	the	root	apparatus	and	the	 plant 	 s 	 	[	 continu 	 e 	 	]	to	work	.
you	can	 re 	 move 	 	90	percent	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	it	is	[	 continu 	 ing 	 	]	to	work	.
so	,	a	 suggest 	 ion 	 	for	the	people	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 network 	 s 	 	:	 plant 	 s 	 	are	able	to	give	you	good	 suggest 	 ions 	 	about	how	to	evolve	 network 	 s 	 	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
let	's	imagine	that	we	can	build	 robot 	 s 	 	and	 robot 	 s 	 	that	are	inspired	by	 plant 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 til 	 	now	,	the	man	was	inspired	just	by	man	or	the	 animal 	 s 	 	in	producing	a	robot	.
we	have	the	 animal 	 oid 	 	--	and	the	normal	 robot 	 s 	 	inspired	by	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 insect 	 oid 	 	,	so	on	.
we	have	the	 and 	 roid 	 s 	 	that	are	inspired	by	man	.
but	why	have	we	not	any	 plant 	 oid 	 	?
well	,	if	you	want	to	fly	,	it	's	good	that	you	look	at	 bird 	 s 	 	--	to	be	inspired	by	 bird 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	want	to	explore	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	,	or	if	you	want	to	 colon 	 ize 	 	new	 territ 	 ory 	 	,	to	best	thing	that	you	can	do	is	to	be	inspired	by	 plant 	 s 	 	that	are	 master 	 s 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	have	 an 	 other 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	[	on	]	in	our	lab	,	[	which	]	is	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	.
it	's	much	more	easy	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	.
hybrid	 mean 	 s 	 	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	half	living	and	half	machine	.
it	's	much	more	easy	to	work	with	 plant 	 s 	 	than	with	 animal 	 s 	 	.
they	have	computing	power	,	they	have	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	.
the	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	the	machine	is	much	more	easy	,	much	more	even	 ethic 	 ally 	 	possible	.
and	these	are	three	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	,	driven	by	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	or	by	the	 leav 	 es 	 	at	the	end	,	by	the	most	,	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 plant 	 s 	 	,	by	the	 root 	 s 	 	.
well	,	thank	you	for	your	attention	.
and	before	i	finish	,	i	would	like	to	 re 	 assure 	 	that	no	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 harm 	 ed 	 	in	making	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.
thank	you	.
