i	'm	going	to	tell	you	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	:	one	is	what	we	have	lost	,	and	two	,	a	way	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	.
and	let	me	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 base 	 line 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	mediterranean	coast	with	no	fish	,	bare	rock	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	sea	 urchin 	 s 	 	that	like	to	eat	the	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	first	saw	when	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	in	the	water	for	the	first	time	in	the	mediterranean	coast	off	spain	.
now	,	if	an	alien	came	to	earth	--	let	's	call	him	joe	--	what	would	joe	see	?
if	joe	 jump 	 ed 	 	in	a	coral	reef	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	the	alien	could	see	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	,	joe	would	jump	on	a	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	coral	reef	,	a	virgin	coral	reef	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	coral	,	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	 crocodile 	 s 	 	,	manatees	,	groupers	,	 turtle 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
so	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	what	joe	would	see	would	be	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	,	in	the	greenish	part	of	the	picture	.
here	we	have	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	with	dead	 coral 	 s 	 	,	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	soup	and	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
and	where	the	 div 	 er 	 	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	where	most	of	the	 reef 	 s 	 	of	the	world	are	now	,	with	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 coral 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	 over 	 growing 	 	the	 coral 	 s 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	bacteria	,	and	where	the	large	 animal 	 s 	 	are	gone	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	most	marine	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 een 	 	too	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 base 	 line 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	think	is	natural	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	modern	science	with	scuba	 div 	 ing 	 	long	after	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	marine	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	get	us	all	on	a	time	machine	,	and	we	're	going	to	the	left	;	we	're	going	to	go	back	to	the	past	to	see	what	the	ocean	was	like	.
and	let	's	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	time	machine	,	the	line	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	where	we	have	 conduct 	 ed 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	sea	is	an	 arch 	 ipelago 	 	 belong 	 ing 	 	to	kiribati	that	 span 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 un 	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	,	unfished	,	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	and	a	few	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	start	with	the	first	one	:	christmas	 is 	 land 	 	,	over	5,000	people	.
most	of	the	 reef 	 s 	 	are	dead	,	most	of	the	 coral 	 s 	 	are	dead	--	overgrown	by	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	--	and	most	of	the	fish	are	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	 pencil 	 s 	 	we	use	to	count	them	.
we	did	250	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 div 	 ing 	 	here	in	2005	.
we	did	n't	see	a	single	 s 	 hark 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	place	that	 cap 	 tain 	 	cook	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	1777	and	he	 de 	 scribed 	 	a	huge	abundance	of	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 bit 	 ing 	 	the	rudders	and	the	 oar 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	small	 boat 	 s 	 	while	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	 a 	 shore 	 	.
let	's	move	the	dial	a	little	bit	to	the	past	.
fanning	 is 	 land 	 	,	2,500	people	.
the	 coral 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	better	here	.	 lot 	 s 	 	of	small	fish	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 man 	 y 	 	divers	would	consider	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	can	see	most	of	the	florida	 key 	 s 	 	national	marine	 sanct 	 uary 	 	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	your	 base 	 line 	 	.
if	we	go	back	to	a	place	like	 palm 	 yra 	 	 a 	 toll 	 	,	where	i	was	with	jeremy	jackson	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	 coral 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	better	and	there	are	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	in	every	single	 d 	 ive 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	.
but	then	,	if	we	shift	the	dial	200	,	500	 year 	 s 	 	back	,	then	we	get	to	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	 coral 	 s 	 	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 health 	 y 	 	and	 gorge 	 ous 	 	,	 form 	 ing 	 	spectacular	 structure 	 s 	 	,	and	where	the	 predator 	 s 	 	are	the	most	conspicuous	thing	,	where	you	see	between	25	and	50	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	per	 d 	 ive 	 	.
what	have	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	these	 place 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	thought	was	natural	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	call	the	 bio 	 mass 	 	pyramid	.
if	we	get	all	of	the	fish	of	a	coral	reef	together	and	weigh	them	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	would	expect	.
most	of	the	 bio 	 mass 	 	is	low	on	the	food	chain	,	the	 herb 	 ivores 	 	,	the	 par 	 rot 	 fish 	 	,	the	surgeonfish	that	eat	the	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	.
then	the	plankton	 feed 	 ers 	 	,	these	little	damselfish	,	the	little	 animal 	 s 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	in	the	water	.
and	then	we	have	a	lower	 bio 	 mass 	 	of	 carnivore 	 s 	 	,	and	a	lower	 bio 	 mass 	 	of	top	head	,	or	the	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	the	large	snappers	,	the	large	groupers	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	view	of	the	world	is	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	 reef 	 s 	 	.
when	we	went	to	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	 reef 	 s 	 	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	natural	world	was	 up 	 side 	 	down	;	 th 	 is 	 	pyramid	was	 in 	 vert 	 ed 	 	.
the	top	head	 do 	 es 	 	account	for	most	of	the	 bio 	 mass 	 	,	in	some	 place 	 s 	 	up	to	85	percent	,	like	kingman	reef	,	which	is	now	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
the	good	news	is	that	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 hav 	 ing 	 	more	 predator 	 s 	 	,	there	's	more	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.
the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	these	boxes	is	 big 	 ger 	 	.
we	have	more	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	more	 bio 	 mass 	 	of	snappers	,	more	 bio 	 mass 	 	of	 herb 	 ivores 	 	,	too	,	like	these	 par 	 rot 	 	fish	that	are	like	marine	 goat 	 s 	 	.
they	clean	the	reef	;	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 grow 	 s 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	,	they	eat	,	and	they	keep	the	reef	clean	and	allow	the	 coral 	 s 	 	to	replenish	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	these	 place 	 s 	 	--	these	ancient	,	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	 place 	 s 	 	--	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	fish	,	but	they	 al 	 so 	 	have	other	 import 	 ant 	 	 component 	 s 	 	of	the	 eco 	 system 	 	like	the	giant	 clam 	 s 	 	;	pavements	of	giant	 clam 	 s 	 	in	the	lagoons	,	up	to	20	,	25	per	square	meter	.
these	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	from	every	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	reef	in	the	world	,	and	they	filter	the	water	;	they	keep	the	water	clean	from	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	and	 pathogen 	 s 	 	.
but	still	,	now	we	have	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
if	we	do	n't	have	 fish 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 reef 	 s 	 	are	 protect 	 ed 	 	by	law	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 remote 	 ness 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	.
but	the	water	 get 	 s 	 	 warm 	 er 	 	for	too	long	and	the	 coral 	 s 	 	die	.
so	how	are	these	fish	,	these	 predator 	 s 	 	going	to	help	?
well	,	what	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	is	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	area	 dur 	 ing 	 	el	nino	,	year	'97	,	'98	,	the	water	was	too	warm	for	too	long	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	 coral 	 s 	 	 bleach 	 ed 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	.
in	christmas	,	where	the	food	web	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 trim 	 med 	 	down	,	where	the	large	 animal 	 s 	 	are	gone	,	the	 coral 	 s 	 	have	not	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
in	fanning	 is 	 land 	 	,	the	 coral 	 s 	 	are	not	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
but	you	see	here	a	big	table	coral	that	 di 	 ed 	 	and	 collapse 	 d 	 	.
and	the	fish	have	 graze 	 d 	 	the	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	,	so	the	turf	of	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	is	a	little	lower	.
then	you	go	to	 palm 	 yra 	 	 a 	 toll 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	more	 bio 	 mass 	 	of	 herb 	 ivores 	 	,	and	the	dead	 coral 	 s 	 	are	clean	,	and	the	 coral 	 s 	 	are	coming	back	.
and	when	you	go	to	the	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	side	,	did	 th 	 is 	 	ever	bleach	?
these	 place 	 s 	 	 bleach 	 ed 	 	too	,	but	they	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	.
the	more	 in 	 tact 	 	,	the	more	complete	,	[	and	]	the	more	complex	your	food	web	,	the	 high 	 er 	 	the	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	[	and	]	the	more	 like 	 ly 	 	that	the	system	is	going	to	 re 	 cover 	 	from	the	short	-	term	 impact 	 s 	 	of	 warm 	 ing 	 	 event 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	good	news	,	so	we	need	to	 re 	 cover 	 	that	structure	.
we	need	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	all	of	the	 piece 	 s 	 	of	the	 eco 	 system 	 	are	there	so	the	 eco 	 system 	 	can	adapt	to	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
so	if	we	have	to	 re 	 set 	 	the	 base 	 line 	 	,	if	we	have	to	push	the	 eco 	 system 	 	back	to	the	left	,	how	can	we	do	it	?
well	,	there	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	ways	.
one	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	way	is	the	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	no	-	take	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	that	we	set	 a 	 side 	 	to	allow	for	the	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	for	marine	life	.
and	let	me	go	back	to	that	image	of	the	mediterranean	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	my	 base 	 line 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	saw	when	i	was	a	kid	.
and	at	the	same	time	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	jacques	cousteau	's	 show 	 s 	 	on	tv	,	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	 rich 	 ness 	 	and	abundance	and	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	thought	that	 th 	 is 	 	 rich 	 ness 	 	 belong 	 ed 	 	to	 tropic 	 al 	 	 sea 	 s 	 	,	and	that	the	mediterranean	was	a	 natural 	 ly 	 	poor	sea	.
but	,	little	did	i	know	,	 un 	 til 	 	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	for	the	first	time	in	a	marine	 re 	 serve 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	saw	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	fish	.
after	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	between	five	and	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	fish	come	back	,	they	eat	the	 urchin 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	grow	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	little	 al 	 gal 	 	forest	,	and	in	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 lap 	 top 	 	you	can	find	more	than	100	species	of	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	 micro 	 scopic 	 	fit	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	species	of	little	 animal 	 s 	 	that	then	feed	the	fish	,	so	that	the	system	 re 	 cover 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	place	,	the	medes	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	marine	 re 	 serve 	 	,	is	 on 	 ly 	 	94	 hectare 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	6	million	 eur 	 os 	 	to	the	local	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	20	 time 	 s 	 	more	than	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	 represent 	 s 	 	88	percent	of	all	the	tourist	revenue	.
so	these	 place 	 s 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	help	the	 eco 	 system 	 	but	 al 	 so 	 	help	the	people	who	can	benefit	from	the	 eco 	 system 	 	.
so	let	me	just	give	you	a	 summ 	 ary 	 	of	what	no	-	take	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	do	.
these	 place 	 s 	 	,	when	we	protect	them	,	if	we	 compar 	 e 	 	them	to	 un 	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	 near 	 by 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
the	number	of	species	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	21	percent	;	so	if	you	have	1,000	species	you	would	expect	200	more	in	a	marine	 re 	 serve 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 sub 	 stantial 	 	.
the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 organism 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	a	third	,	so	your	fish	are	now	 th 	 is 	 	big	.
the	abundance	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	fish	you	have	per	square	meter	,	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	170	percent	.
and	the	 bio 	 mass 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	spectacular	change	--	4.5	 time 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	 bio 	 mass 	 	on	average	,	just	after	five	to	seven	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	some	 place 	 s 	 	up	to	10	 time 	 s 	 	 large 	 r 	 	 bio 	 mass 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	 re 	 serve 	 	that	grow	,	and	what	do	they	do	?
they	 re 	 produce 	 	.	that	's	population	biology	101	.
if	you	do	n't	kill	the	fish	,	they	take	a	 long 	 er 	 	time	to	die	,	they	grow	 large 	 r 	 	and	they	 re 	 produce 	 	a	lot	.
and	same	thing	for	 in 	 vertebrate 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
these	are	egg	 case 	 s 	 	laid	by	a	 s 	 nail 	 	off	the	coast	of	chile	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	 man 	 y 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	they	lay	on	the	bottom	.
 out 	 side 	 	the	 re 	 serve 	 	,	you	can	not	even	detect	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	point	three	million	 egg 	 s 	 	per	square	meter	 in 	 side 	 	the	marine	 re 	 serve 	 	where	these	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	abundant	.
so	these	 organism 	 s 	 	 re 	 produce 	 	,	the	little	 larva 	 e 	 	 juvenile 	 s 	 	 s 	 pill 	 	over	,	they	all	 s 	 pill 	 	over	,	and	then	people	can	benefit	from	them	 out 	 side 	 	too	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	bahamas	:	nassau	 group 	 er 	 	.
huge	abundance	of	groupers	 in 	 side 	 	the	 re 	 serve 	 	,	and	the	 close 	 r 	 	you	get	to	the	 re 	 serve 	 	,	the	more	fish	you	have	.
so	the	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	are	 catch 	 ing 	 	more	.
you	can	see	where	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	the	 re 	 serve 	 	are	 be 	 cause 	 	you	see	the	 boat 	 s 	 	lined	up	.
so	there	is	 s 	 pill 	 	over	;	there	are	 benefit 	 s 	 	beyond	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	these	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	that	help	people	around	them	,	while	at	the	same	time	the	 re 	 serve 	 	is	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	entire	 habit 	 at 	 	.	it	is	building	 resili 	 ence 	 	.
so	what	we	have	now	--	or	a	world	 with 	 out 	 	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	--	is	like	a	 de 	 bit 	 	account	where	we	withdraw	all	the	time	and	we	never	make	any	deposit	.
 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	are	like	 saving 	 s 	 	 account 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	principal	that	we	do	n't	touch	;	that	 produce 	 s 	 	 return 	 s 	 	,	social	,	economic	and	 eco 	 logical 	 	.
and	if	we	think	about	the	 in 	 crease 	 	of	 bio 	 mass 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	 com 	 pound 	 	interest	.
two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	of	how	these	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	can	benefit	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	much	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	get	 every 	 day 	 	in	kenya	,	 fish 	 ing 	 	over	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	a	place	where	there	is	no	 protect 	 ion 	 	;	it	's	a	free	-	for	-	all	.
once	the	most	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	gear	,	seine	 net 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	,	the	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 catch 	 ing 	 	more	.
if	you	fish	less	,	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 catch 	 ing 	 	more	.
but	if	we	add	the	no	-	take	 re 	 serve 	 	on	top	of	that	,	the	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	are	still	making	more	money	by	 fish 	 ing 	 	less	around	an	area	that	is	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	nassau	groupers	in	belize	in	the	mesoamerican	reef	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 group 	 er 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	,	and	the	groupers	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	around	the	full	 moon 	 s 	 	of	december	and	january	for	a	week	.
they	used	to	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	up	to	the	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	30,000	groupers	about	 th 	 is 	 	big	in	one	hectare	,	in	one	 aggreg 	 ation 	 	.
 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	 k 	 new 	 	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	;	they	caught	them	,	and	they	 deplete 	 d 	 	them	.
when	i	went	there	for	the	first	time	in	2000	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	3,000	groupers	left	.
and	the	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 author 	 ized 	 	to	catch	30	percent	of	the	entire	 spawn 	 ing 	 	population	every	year	.
so	we	did	a	simple	analysis	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	rocket	science	to	figure	out	that	,	if	you	take	30	percent	every	year	,	your	 fish 	 ery 	 	is	going	to	collapse	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	with	the	 fish 	 ery 	 	,	the	entire	 re 	 productive 	 	ability	of	the	species	 go 	 es 	 	extinct	.
it	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	around	the	caribbean	.
and	they	would	make	4,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	year	,	total	,	for	the	entire	 fish 	 ery 	 	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	 boat 	 s 	 	.
now	,	if	you	do	an	economic	analysis	and	project	what	would	happen	if	the	fish	 we 	 re 	 	not	cut	,	if	we	 br 	 ought 	 	just	20	divers	one	month	per	year	,	the	revenue	would	be	more	than	20	 time 	 s 	 	 high 	 er 	 	and	that	would	be	 sustain 	 able 	 	over	time	.
so	how	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	do	we	have	?
if	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	good	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	no	-	 brain 	 er 	 	,	how	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	do	we	have	?
and	you	 al 	 ready 	 	heard	that	less	than	one	percent	of	the	ocean	's	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	to	one	percent	now	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	 protect 	 ions 	 	of	the	chagos	 arch 	 ipelago 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	a	fraction	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	fully	 protect 	 ed 	 	from	 fish 	 ing 	 	.
scientific	 stud 	 ies 	 	recommend	that	at	 l 	 east 	 	20	percent	of	the	ocean	should	be	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
the	 estimate 	 d 	 	range	is	between	20	and	50	percent	for	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 goal 	 s 	 	of	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	 fish 	 ery 	 	 enhance 	 ment 	 	and	 resili 	 ence 	 	.
now	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	possible	?	people	would	ask	:	how	much	would	that	cost	?
well	,	let	's	think	about	how	much	we	are	 pay 	 ing 	 	now	to	subsidize	 fish 	 ing 	 	:	35	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	year	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	go	to	 destruct 	 ive 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	 practice 	 s 	 	.
well	,	there	are	a	couple	 estimate 	 s 	 	of	how	much	it	would	cost	to	create	a	network	of	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	20	percent	of	the	ocean	that	would	be	 on 	 ly 	 	a	fraction	of	what	we	are	now	 pay 	 ing 	 	;	the	government	 hand 	 s 	 	out	to	a	 fish 	 ery 	 	that	is	 col 	 lap 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
people	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 fish 	 eries 	 	are	 col 	 lap 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
a	creation	of	a	network	of	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	would	provide	direct	 employ 	 ment 	 	for	more	than	a	million	people	plus	all	the	 second 	 ary 	 	 job 	 s 	 	and	all	the	 second 	 ary 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
so	how	can	we	do	that	?
if	it	's	so	clear	that	these	 saving 	 s 	 	 account 	 s 	 	are	good	for	the	environment	and	for	people	,	why	do	n't	we	have	20	,	50	percent	of	the	ocean	?
and	how	can	we	reach	that	goal	?
well	,	there	are	two	ways	of	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.
the	trivial	solution	is	to	create	 re 	 ally 	 	large	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	like	the	chagos	 arch 	 ipelago 	 	.
the	problem	is	that	we	can	create	these	large	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	there	are	no	people	,	where	there	is	no	social	conflict	,	where	the	 politic 	 al 	 	cost	is	 re 	 ally 	 	low	and	the	economic	cost	is	 al 	 so 	 	low	.
and	a	few	of	us	,	a	few	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	and	 else 	 where 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	what	about	the	rest	of	the	coast	of	the	world	,	where	people	live	and	make	a	living	out	of	 fish 	 ing 	 	?
well	,	there	are	three	main	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	do	n't	have	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	small	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	:	the	first	one	is	that	people	have	no	idea	what	marine	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	do	,	and	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	tend	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	defensive	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 regulat 	 ing 	 	or	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	an	area	,	even	if	it	's	small	.
second	,	the	 govern 	 ance 	 	is	not	right	 be 	 cause 	 	most	 coast 	 al 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	around	the	world	do	n't	have	the	 author 	 ity 	 	to	monitor	the	 resource 	 s 	 	to	create	the	 re 	 serve 	 	and	enforce	it	.
it	's	a	top	down	 hierarch 	 ical 	 	structure	where	people	wait	for	government	 agent 	 s 	 	to	come	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	effective	.	and	the	government	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	.
which	 take 	 s 	 	us	to	the	third	reason	,	why	we	do	n't	have	 man 	 y 	 	more	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	,	is	that	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	 model 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	wrong	.
ngos	and	 government 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	and	energy	and	 resource 	 s 	 	in	a	few	small	 area 	 s 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	.
so	marine	 conserv 	 ation 	 	and	 coast 	 al 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	sink	for	government	or	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	money	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
so	the	 solution 	 s 	 	are	just	 fix 	 ing 	 	these	three	 issue 	 s 	 	.
first	,	we	need	to	develop	a	global	 aware 	 ness 	 	campaign	to	inspire	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	 government 	 s 	 	to	create	no	-	take	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	that	are	better	than	what	we	have	now	.
it	's	the	 saving 	 s 	 	 account 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	 de 	 bit 	 	 account 	 s 	 	with	no	 deposit 	 s 	 	.
second	,	we	need	to	 re 	 design 	 	our	 govern 	 ance 	 	so	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 effort 	 s 	 	can	be	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	,	so	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 effort 	 s 	 	do	n't	depend	on	work	from	ngos	or	from	government	 age 	 ncies 	 	and	can	be	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	like	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	philippines	and	a	few	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	third	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	we	need	to	develop	new	business	 model 	 s 	 	.
the	 philanthro 	 py 	 	sink	 a 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	create	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	is	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	develop	 model 	 s 	 	,	business	 model 	 s 	 	,	where	 coast 	 al 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	is	an	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	that	these	marine	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	provide	social	,	 eco 	 logical 	 	and	economic	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'd	like	to	finish	with	one	thought	,	which	is	that	no	one	 organ 	 ization 	 	 al 	 one 	 	is	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	ocean	.
there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	of	 com 	 petition 	 	in	the	past	,	and	we	need	to	develop	a	new	model	of	 partner 	 ship 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	 collabor 	 ative 	 	,	where	we	are	looking	for	complementing	,	not	 substitut 	 ing 	 	.
the	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	are	just	too	high	to	 continu 	 e 	 	the	way	we	are	going	.
so	let	's	do	that	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	thank	you	enric	.
enric	sala	:	thank	you	.
ca	:	that	was	a	masterful	job	of	 pull 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	.
first	of	all	,	your	pyramid	,	your	 in 	 vert 	 ed 	 	pyramid	,	 show 	 ing 	 	85	percent	 bio 	 mass 	 	in	the	 predator 	 s 	 	,	that	 seem 	 s 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
how	could	85	percent	 surviv 	 e 	 	on	15	percent	?
es	:	well	,	imagine	that	you	have	two	 gear 	 s 	 	of	a	watch	,	a	big	one	and	a	small	one	.
the	big	one	is	moving	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	and	the	small	one	is	moving	fast	.
that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	.
the	 animal 	 s 	 	at	the	lower	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	food	chain	,	they	 re 	 produce 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	;	they	grow	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	;	they	produce	 million 	 s 	 	of	 egg 	 s 	 	.
up	there	,	you	have	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	and	large	fish	that	live	25	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
they	 re 	 produce 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	;	they	have	a	 s 	 low 	 	 metabol 	 ism 	 	;	and	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	they	just	maintain	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 mass 	 	.
so	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	production	 sur 	 plus 	 	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	down	there	is	 en 	 ough 	 	to	maintain	 th 	 is 	 	 bio 	 mass 	 	that	is	not	moving	.
they	are	like	capacitors	of	the	system	.
ca	:	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
so	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	our	picture	of	a	food	pyramid	is	just	--	we	have	to	change	that	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
es	:	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	 sea 	 s 	 	.
what	we	found	in	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 in 	 vert 	 ed 	 	pyramid	is	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	serengeti	,	with	five	 lion 	 s 	 	per	wildebeest	.
and	on	land	,	 th 	 is 	 	can	not	work	.
but	at	 l 	 east 	 	on	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	are	 system 	 s 	 	where	there	is	a	bottom	component	with	structure	.
we	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	universal	.
but	we	have	 start 	 ed 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	 reef 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
ca	:	so	the	 number 	 s 	 	you	 present 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	35	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	now	on	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	.
it	would	 on 	 ly 	 	cost	16	billion	to	set	up	20	percent	of	the	ocean	 a 	 s 	 	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	give	new	living	 choice 	 s 	 	to	the	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
if	the	world	was	a	 smart 	 er 	 	place	,	we	could	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	for	negative	19	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
we	've	got	19	billion	to	 s 	 pend 	 	on	health	care	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
es	:	and	then	we	have	the	under	-	performance	of	 fish 	 eries 	 	that	is	50	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	one	of	the	big	 solution 	 s 	 	is	have	the	world	trade	 organ 	 ization 	 	shifting	the	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	to	 sustain 	 able 	 	 practice 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	there	's	a	lot	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 hear 	 ing 	 	out	there	about	 end 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	 mad 	 ness 	 	.
so	thank	you	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
the	last	one	's	a	personal	question	.
a	lot	of	the	experience	of	people	here	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	for	a	long	time	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	degradation	,	the	 place 	 s 	 	they	saw	that	 we 	 re 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	 depress 	 ing 	 	.
talk	to	me	about	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	you	must	have	 experience 	 d 	 	of	going	to	these	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	 area 	 s 	 	and	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	coming	back	.
es	:	it	is	a	spiritual	experience	.
we	go	there	to	try	to	understand	the	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	,	to	try	to	measure	or	count	fish	and	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	and	see	how	these	 place 	 s 	 	are	different	from	the	 place 	 s 	 	we	know	.
but	the	best	 feel 	 ing 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 bio 	 philia 	 	that	e.o	.	wilson	 talk 	 s 	 	about	,	where	 human 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	awe	and	wonder	in	front	of	untamed	nature	,	of	raw	nature	.
and	there	,	 on 	 ly 	 	there	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	that	you	are	part	of	a	 large 	 r 	 	thing	or	of	a	 large 	 r 	 	global	 eco 	 system 	 	.
and	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	not	for	these	 place 	 s 	 	that	show	hope	,	i	do	n't	think	i	could	 continu 	 e 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	job	.
it	would	be	just	too	 depress 	 ing 	 	.
ca	:	well	,	enric	,	thank	you	so	much	for	sharing	some	of	that	spiritual	experience	with	us	all	.	thank	you	.
es	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
