a	fact	came	out	of	mit	,	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	ken	hale	,	who	's	a	linguist	,	 s 	 aid 	 	that	of	the	6,000	 language 	 s 	 	spoken	on	earth	right	now	,	3,000	are	n't	spoken	by	the	children	.
so	that	in	one	generation	,	we	're	going	to	 halv 	 e 	 	our	cultural	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
he	went	on	to	say	that	every	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	an	elder	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	grave	 carry 	 ing 	 	the	last	spoken	word	of	that	culture	.
so	an	entire	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	a	body	of	knowledge	about	the	natural	world	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 empir 	 ically 	 	 gle 	 an 	 ed 	 	over	centuries	,	 go 	 es 	 	away	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	every	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
so	for	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	since	my	 dent 	 al 	 	experience	,	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	the	world	and	coming	back	with	 st 	 ories 	 	about	some	of	these	people	.
what	i	'd	like	to	do	right	now	is	share	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	with	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	tamdin	.
she	is	a	69	-	year	-	old	 n 	 un 	 	.
she	was	 throw 	 n 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	in	tibet	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	for	 put 	 ting 	 	up	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	 pla 	 card 	 	 protest 	 ing 	 	the	occupation	of	her	country	.
and	when	i	met	her	,	she	had	just	taken	a	walk	over	the	himalayas	from	lhasa	,	the	capital	of	tibet	,	 in 	 to 	 	nepal	,	 a 	 cross 	 	to	india	--	30	 day 	 s 	 	--	to	meet	her	 lead 	 er 	 	,	the	dalai	lama	.
the	dalai	lama	 live 	 s 	 	in	dharamsala	,	india	.
so	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	picture	three	 day 	 s 	 	after	she	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	had	 th 	 is 	 	beat	-	up	pair	of	tennis	 shoe 	 s 	 	on	,	with	her	 to 	 es 	 	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	.
and	she	 cross 	 ed 	 	in	march	,	and	there	's	a	lot	of	snow	at	18,500	feet	in	march	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	paldin	.
paldin	is	a	62	-	year	-	old	monk	.
and	he	 s 	 pent 	 	33	 year 	 s 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.
his	whole	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	was	 throw 	 n 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	at	the	time	of	the	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 	,	when	the	dalai	lama	had	to	 leav 	 e 	 	tibet	.
and	he	was	 beat 	 en 	 	,	 starv 	 ed 	 	,	 torture 	 d 	 	--	lost	all	his	 tee 	 th 	 	while	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.
and	when	i	met	him	,	he	was	a	kind	gentle	old	man	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	me	--	i	met	him	two	 week 	 s 	 	after	he	got	out	of	 pri 	 son 	 	--	that	he	went	through	that	experience	,	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	the	demeanor	that	he	had	.
so	i	was	in	dharamsala	 meet 	 ing 	 	these	people	,	and	i	'd	 s 	 pent 	 	about	five	 week 	 s 	 	there	,	and	i	was	 hear 	 ing 	 	these	similar	 st 	 ories 	 	of	these	 refuge 	 es 	 	that	had	 pour 	 ed 	 	out	of	tibet	 in 	 to 	 	dharamsala	.
and	it	just	so	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	on	the	fifth	week	,	there	was	a	public	 teach 	 ing 	 	by	the	dalai	lama	.
and	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	crowd	of	 monk 	 s 	 	and	 n 	 un 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	which	i	had	just	 interview 	 ed 	 	,	and	heard	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	little	fm	radio	,	and	we	could	listen	to	the	 transl 	 ation 	 	of	his	 teach 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	was	:	treat	your	 ene 	 mies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	precious	 jewel 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	your	 ene 	 mies 	 	that	build	your	 toler 	 ance 	 	and	patience	on	the	road	to	your	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
that	hit	me	so	hard	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	these	people	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	experience	.
so	,	two	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	tibet	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 interview 	 ing 	 	the	people	there	,	taking	my	 photograph 	 s 	 	.	that	's	what	i	do	.
i	interview	and	do	 portrait 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	girl	.
i	took	her	portrait	up	on	top	of	the	jokhang	temple	.
and	i	'd	snuck	in	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	to	have	a	picture	of	the	dalai	lama	in	tibet	--	it	's	the	 quick 	 est 	 	way	you	can	get	 arrest 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	snuck	in	a	bunch	of	little	wallet	-	sized	 picture 	 s 	 	of	the	dalai	lama	,	and	i	would	hand	them	out	.
and	when	i	 g 	 ave 	 	them	to	the	people	,	they	'd	either	hold	them	to	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	,	or	they	'd	hold	them	up	to	 the 	 ir 	 	head	and	just	stay	there	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	well	,	at	the	time	--	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	that	was	36	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	dalai	lama	had	left	.
so	i	was	going	in	,	 interview 	 ing 	 	these	people	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 portrait 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	jigme	and	her	sister	,	sonam	.
and	they	live	up	on	the	chang	tang	,	the	tibetan	 plate 	 au 	 	,	way	in	the	western	part	of	the	country	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	at	17,000	feet	.
and	they	had	just	come	down	from	the	high	 past 	 ures 	 	,	at	18,000	feet	.
same	thing	:	 g 	 ave 	 	her	a	picture	,	she	held	it	up	to	her	 fore 	 head 	 	.
and	i	 usual 	 ly 	 	hand	out	polaroids	when	i	do	these	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	setting	up	 light 	 s 	 	,	and	 check 	 ing 	 	my	 light 	 s 	 	,	and	when	i	 show 	 ed 	 	her	her	polaroid	,	she	 s 	 cream 	 ed 	 	and	ran	 in 	 to 	 	her	tent	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	tenzin	gyatso	;	he	was	found	to	be	the	buddha	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	at	the	age	of	two	,	out	in	a	peasant	's	house	,	way	out	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	.
at	the	age	of	four	,	he	was	 install 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	14th	dalai	lama	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	teenager	,	he	 face 	 d 	 	the	invasion	of	his	country	,	and	had	to	deal	with	it	--	he	was	the	 lead 	 er 	 	of	the	country	.
eight	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	they	 discover 	 ed 	 	there	was	a	plot	to	kill	him	,	they	 dress 	 ed 	 	him	up	like	a	 beg 	 gar 	 	and	snuck	him	out	of	the	country	on	 horse 	 back 	 	,	and	took	the	same	trip	that	tamdin	did	.
and	he	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	back	to	his	country	since	.
and	if	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	man	,	46	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	still	 stick 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	non	-	violent	 respons 	 e 	 	to	a	severe	 politic 	 al 	 	and	human	 right 	 s 	 	issue	.
and	the	young	people	,	young	tibetans	,	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	listen	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
you	know	,	violence	 a 	 s 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	tool	is	all	the	rage	right	now	.
and	he	still	is	 hold 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	line	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	icon	to	non	-	violence	in	our	world	--	one	of	our	living	 icon 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	of	his	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	moi	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	ecuadorian	amazon	.
and	moi	is	35	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	area	of	the	ecuadorian	amazon	--	oil	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	1972	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	period	of	time	--	since	that	time	--	 a 	 s 	 	much	oil	,	or	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	oil	 a 	 s 	 	was	 s 	 pill 	 ed 	 	in	the	exxon	valdez	accident	,	was	 s 	 pill 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	area	of	the	amazon	,	and	the	 tribe 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	have	 constant 	 ly 	 	had	to	move	.
and	moi	 belong 	 s 	 	to	the	huaorani	tribe	,	and	they	're	known	 a 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fierce	,	they	're	known	 a 	 s 	 	``	 au 	 ca 	 	.	``
and	they	've	 manage 	 d 	 	to	keep	out	the	 seismo 	 logists 	 	and	the	oil	 work 	 ers 	 	with	 spear 	 s 	 	and	 blow 	 gun 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 s 	 pent 	 	--	i	was	with	a	team	--	two	 week 	 s 	 	with	these	 guy 	 s 	 	out	in	the	jungle	 watch 	 ing 	 	them	hunt	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	on	a	monkey	hunt	,	 hunt 	 ing 	 	with	curare	-	tipped	 d 	 art 	 s 	 	.
and	the	knowledge	that	these	people	have	about	the	natural	environment	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.
they	could	hear	 thing 	 s 	 	,	smell	 thing 	 s 	 	,	see	 thing 	 s 	 	i	could	n't	see	.
and	i	could	n't	even	see	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	with	these	 d 	 art 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	yadira	,	and	yadira	is	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	.	she	's	in	a	tribe	that	's	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	the	huaorani	.
and	her	tribe	 ha 	 s 	 	had	to	move	three	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	.
and	we	never	hear	about	that	.	and	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 in 	 fraction 	 	against	these	people	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	plan	colombia	,	we	're	 spray 	 ing 	 	paraquat	or	round	up	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	--	we	're	 defoli 	 ating 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 acre 	 s 	 	of	the	ecuadorian	amazon	in	our	war	on	 drug 	 s 	 	.
and	these	people	are	the	people	who	take	the	 br 	 un 	 t 	 	of	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	mengatoue	.
he	's	the	 sha 	 man 	 	of	the	huaorani	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	us	,	you	know	,	i	'm	an	 old 	 er 	 	man	now	;	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	 tire 	 d 	 	,	you	know	;	i	'm	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 spear 	 ing 	 	these	oil	 work 	 ers 	 	.
i	wish	they	would	just	go	away	.
and	i	was	--	i	 usual 	 ly 	 	travel	 al 	 one 	 	when	i	do	my	work	,	but	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	 host 	 ed 	 	a	program	for	 discover 	 y 	 	,	and	when	i	went	down	with	the	team	,	i	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	going	in	with	a	whole	bunch	of	people	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	huaorani	,	deep	 in 	 to 	 	the	huaorani	tribe	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	taught	me	a	thing	or	two	about	 blend 	 ing 	 	in	with	the	 local 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	did	just	before	9/11	--	august	of	2001	--	i	took	my	son	,	dax	,	who	was	16	at	the	time	,	and	i	took	him	to	pakistan	.
 be 	 cause 	 	at	first	i	 want 	 ed 	 	--	you	know	,	i	've	taken	him	on	a	couple	of	 trip 	 s 	 	,	but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	him	to	see	people	that	live	on	a	dollar	a	day	or	less	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	him	to	get	an	experience	in	the	islamic	world	and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	him	to	--	i	was	going	there	to	work	with	a	group	,	do	a	story	on	a	group	 call 	 ed 	 	the	kalash	,	that	are	a	group	of	 anim 	 ists 	 	,	3,000	 anim 	 ists 	 	,	that	live	--	 ver 	 y 	 	small	area	--	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	islam	--	there	's	3,000	of	these	kalash	left	;	they	're	 in 	 credible 	 	people	.
so	it	was	a	great	experience	for	him	.	he	 stay 	 ed 	 	up	all	night	with	them	,	 drum 	 ming 	 	and	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
and	he	 br 	 ought 	 	a	soccer	ball	,	and	we	had	soccer	every	night	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	village	.
and	then	we	went	up	and	met	 the 	 ir 	 	 sha 	 man 	 	.
by	the	way	,	mengatoue	was	the	 sha 	 man 	 	of	his	tribe	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	john	doolikahn	,	who	's	the	 sha 	 man 	 	of	the	kalash	.
and	he	's	up	in	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	right	on	the	border	with	afghanistan	.
in	fact	,	on	that	other	side	is	the	area	,	tora	bora	,	the	area	where	osama	bin	laden	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 trib 	 al 	 	area	.
and	we	 watch 	 ed 	 	and	 stay 	 ed 	 	with	john	doolikahn	.
and	the	 sha 	 man 	 	--	i	did	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	on	 sha 	 man 	 ism 	 	,	which	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
but	around	the	world	,	they	go	 in 	 to 	 	trance	in	different	ways	,	and	in	pakistan	,	the	way	they	do	it	is	they	burn	 juni 	 per 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	and	they	sacrifice	an	animal	,	pour	the	blood	of	the	animal	on	the	 leav 	 es 	 	and	then	 inhal 	 e 	 	the	smoke	.
and	they	're	all	 pray 	 ing 	 	to	the	mountain	 god 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	 in 	 to 	 	trance	.
you	know	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	used	to	different	 real 	 ities 	 	,	i	think	,	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.	what	dan	dennett	 s 	 aid 	 	the	other	day	--	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	curriculum	where	they	 stud 	 y 	 	different	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	just	to	make	a	mental	 flex 	 ibility 	 	,	give	them	a	mental	 flex 	 ibility 	 	in	different	belief	 system 	 s 	 	--	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 necess 	 ary 	 	in	our	world	 to 	 day 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	these	 c 	 lash 	 	of	 belief 	 s 	 	taking	place	.
and	all	the	security	 issue 	 s 	 	they	cause	us	.
so	,	one	thing	we	did	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	:	we	 start 	 ed 	 	a	program	that	 link 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 indi 	 genous 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	with	 kid 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	we	first	 hook 	 ed 	 	up	a	spot	in	the	navajo	nation	with	a	 class 	 room 	 	in	seattle	.
we	now	have	15	 s 	 ites 	 	.
we	have	one	in	kathmandu	,	nepal	;	dharamsala	,	india	;	takaungu	,	kenya	--	takaungu	is	one	-	third	christian	,	one	-	third	muslim	and	one	-	third	 anim 	 ist 	 	,	the	community	is	--	ollantaytambo	,	peru	,	and	 arc 	 tic 	 	village	,	alaska	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	daniel	;	he	's	one	of	our	 student 	 s 	 	in	 arc 	 tic 	 	village	,	alaska	.
he	 live 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	log	 cab 	 in 	 	--	no	running	water	,	no	heat	other	than	--	no	 window 	 s 	 	and	high	-	speed	 inter 	 net 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	i	see	 th 	 is 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	out	all	over	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	 s 	 ite 	 	in	ollantaytambo	,	peru	,	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	where	they	first	saw	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 computer 	 s 	 	;	now	they	have	 computer 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
and	the	way	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	we	teach	digital	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	to	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	we	have	them	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	about	 issue 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	community	in	 the 	 ir 	 	community	that	they	care	about	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	peru	,	where	the	 kid 	 s 	 	told	the	story	about	a	river	that	they	 clean 	 ed 	 	up	.
and	the	way	we	do	it	is	,	we	do	it	in	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 br 	 ing 	 	people	who	want	to	learn	digital	 work 	 flow 	 	and	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	and	have	them	work	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	just	 th 	 is 	 	last	year	we	've	taken	a	group	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	in	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	the	best	.
so	our	dream	is	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	together	,	so	they	'll	have	a	community	service	experience	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	a	cross	-	cultural	experience	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	in	these	 area 	 s 	 	and	help	them	build	 the 	 ir 	 	communication	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 teach 	 ing 	 	photoshop	in	the	tibetan	children	's	village	in	dharamsala	.
we	have	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	where	the	 kid 	 s 	 	all	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 page 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	.	we	've	got	about	60	 movie 	 s 	 	that	these	 kid 	 s 	 	have	made	,	and	they	're	 quit 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
the	one	i	want	to	show	you	--	after	we	get	them	to	make	the	 movie 	 s 	 	,	we	have	a	night	where	we	show	the	 movie 	 s 	 	to	the	community	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	takaungu	--	we	've	got	a	 gene 	 rator 	 	and	a	digital	 project 	 or 	 	,	and	we	're	 project 	 ing 	 	it	up	against	a	barn	,	and	 show 	 ing 	 	one	of	the	 movie 	 s 	 	that	they	made	.
and	if	you	get	a	chance	,	you	can	go	to	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	you	'll	see	the	 in 	 credible 	 	work	these	 kid 	 s 	 	do	.
the	other	thing	:	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	 indi 	 genous 	 	people	a	voice	.
that	was	one	of	the	big	 motiv 	 ating 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	.
but	the	other	 motiv 	 ating 	 	factor	is	the	 insula 	 r 	 	nature	of	our	country	.
national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	just	did	a	roper	 stud 	 y 	 	of	18	to	26	year	olds	in	our	country	and	in	nine	other	 industrial 	 ized 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
it	was	a	two	million	dollar	 stud 	 y 	 	.
 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	came	in	second	to	last	in	 geo 	 graphic 	 	knowledge	.
