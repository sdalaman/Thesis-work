18	 minute 	 s 	 	is	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	brutal	time	limit	,	so	i	'm	going	to	 d 	 ive 	 	straight	in	,	right	at	the	point	where	i	get	 th 	 is 	 	thing	to	work	.
here	we	go	.	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	five	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	why	 defeat 	 ing 	 	aging	is	 desir 	 able 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	why	we	have	to	get	our	shit	together	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	a	bit	more	than	we	do	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 feas 	 ibility 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	of	course	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	why	we	are	so	 fatal 	 istic 	 	about	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	about	aging	.
and	then	i	'm	going	 s 	 pend 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	second	half	of	the	talk	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	you	know	,	how	we	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	prove	that	 fatal 	 ism 	 	is	wrong	,	 name 	 ly 	 	,	by	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
i	'm	going	to	do	that	in	two	 step 	 s 	 	.
the	first	one	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	how	to	get	from	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	modest	amount	of	life	 extens 	 ion 	 	--	which	i	'm	going	to	define	 a 	 s 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	people	who	are	 al 	 ready 	 	in	middle	-	age	when	you	start	--	to	a	point	which	can	 genuine 	 ly 	 	be	 call 	 ed 	 	 defeat 	 ing 	 	aging	.
 name 	 ly 	 	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	an	 elimi 	 nation 	 	of	the	relationship	between	how	old	you	are	and	how	 like 	 ly 	 	you	are	to	die	in	the	next	year	--	or	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	to	get	sick	in	the	first	place	.
and	of	course	,	the	last	thing	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	how	to	reach	that	 inter 	 mediate 	 	step	,	that	point	of	 may 	 be 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	life	 extens 	 ion 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	start	with	why	we	should	.
now	,	i	want	to	ask	a	question	.
 hand 	 s 	 	up	:	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	audience	who	is	in	favor	of	malaria	?
that	was	easy	.	ok	.
ok	.	 hand 	 s 	 	up	:	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	audience	who	's	not	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	malaria	is	a	good	thing	or	a	bad	thing	?
ok	.	so	we	all	think	malaria	is	a	bad	thing	.
that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	news	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	that	was	what	the	answer	would	be	.
now	the	thing	is	,	i	would	like	to	put	it	to	you	that	the	main	reason	why	we	think	that	malaria	is	a	bad	thing	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	 character 	 istic 	 	of	malaria	that	it	 share 	 s 	 	with	aging	.
and	here	is	that	 character 	 istic 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	real	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	that	aging	 kill 	 s 	 	 consider 	 ably 	 	more	people	than	malaria	 do 	 es 	 	.
now	,	i	like	in	an	audience	,	in	britain	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	to	talk	about	the	 compar 	 ison 	 	with	 fox 	 hunt 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 bann 	 ed 	 	after	a	long	struggle	,	by	the	government	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	mean	,	i	know	i	'm	with	a	 sym 	 pathetic 	 	audience	here	,	but	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	,	a	lot	of	people	are	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	 persuad 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	logic	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	good	 compar 	 ison 	 	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	.
you	know	,	a	lot	of	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	city	 boy 	 s 	 	have	no	business	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	 r 	 ural 	 	 type 	 s 	 	what	to	do	with	our	time	.
it	's	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	part	of	the	way	of	life	,	and	we	should	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	carry	on	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
it	's	 eco 	 logically 	 	sound	;	it	 stop 	 s 	 	the	population	explosion	of	 fox 	 es 	 	.	``
but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	the	government	 prevail 	 ed 	 	in	the	end	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	british	public	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 member 	 s 	 	of	parliament	,	came	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	should	not	be	 toler 	 ated 	 	in	a	 civil 	 ized 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	i	think	that	human	aging	 share 	 s 	 	all	of	these	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 pad 	 es 	 	.
what	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	do	people	not	understand	?
it	's	not	just	about	life	,	of	course	--	--	it	's	about	 health 	 y 	 	life	,	you	know	--	 get 	 ting 	 	 f 	 rail 	 	and	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	and	dependent	is	no	 f 	 un 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	 dy 	 ing 	 	may	be	 f 	 un 	 	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	i	would	like	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	.
it	's	a	global	trance	.
these	are	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	 excuse 	 s 	 	that	people	give	for	aging	.
and	,	i	mean	,	ok	,	i	'm	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	these	 excuse 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 value 	 less 	 	.
there	are	some	good	 point 	 s 	 	to	be	made	here	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	ought	to	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	forward	 plan 	 ning 	 	so	that	 noth 	 ing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	too	--	well	,	so	that	we	 minim 	 ize 	 	the	 turbul 	 ence 	 	when	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	figure	out	how	to	fix	aging	.
but	these	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	crazy	,	when	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	remember	your	sense	of	proportion	.
you	know	,	these	are	 argument 	 s 	 	;	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	would	be	legitimate	to	be	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	.
but	the	question	is	,	are	they	so	 danger 	 ous 	 	--	these	 risk 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	aging	--	that	they	outweigh	the	 down 	 side 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	 name 	 ly 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	aging	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	?
are	these	so	bad	that	they	outweigh	 condemn 	 ing 	 	100,000	people	a	day	to	an	 un 	 necess 	 arily 	 	early	death	?
you	know	,	if	you	have	n't	got	an	argument	that	's	that	strong	,	then	just	do	n't	waste	my	time	,	is	what	i	say	.
now	,	there	is	one	argument	that	some	people	do	think	 re 	 ally 	 	is	that	strong	,	and	here	it	is	.
people	worry	about	 over 	 population 	 	;	they	say	,	``	well	,	if	we	fix	aging	,	no	one	's	going	to	die	to	speak	of	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	the	death	toll	is	going	to	be	much	lower	,	 on 	 ly 	 	from	 cross 	 ing 	 	st.	giles	 care 	 lessly 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	we	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	have	 man 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	most	people	.	``
and	that	's	true	.
and	you	know	,	a	lot	of	people	try	to	fudge	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	and	give	 answer 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	do	n't	agree	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 answer 	 s 	 	.	i	think	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	do	n't	work	.
i	think	it	's	true	,	that	we	will	face	a	dilemma	in	 th 	 is 	 	respect	.
we	will	have	to	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	to	have	a	low	birth	rate	,	or	a	high	death	rate	.
a	high	death	rate	will	,	of	course	,	arise	from	 simpl 	 y 	 	 reject 	 ing 	 	these	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	in	favor	of	 carry 	 ing 	 	on	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	,	i	say	that	that	's	fine	--	the	future	of	 human 	 ity 	 	is	 en 	 titled 	 	to	make	that	choice	.
what	's	not	fine	is	for	us	to	make	that	choice	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	the	future	.
if	we	 vac 	 ill 	 ate 	 	,	 hesit 	 ate 	 	,	and	do	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	develop	these	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	then	we	are	 condemn 	 ing 	 	a	whole	cohort	of	people	--	who	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	young	 en 	 ough 	 	and	 health 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	benefit	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	but	will	not	be	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	 develop 	 ed 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	--	we	'll	be	 den 	 y 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	people	an	 in 	 definite 	 	life	span	,	and	i	consider	that	that	is	immoral	.
that	's	my	answer	to	the	 over 	 population 	 	question	.
right	.	so	the	next	thing	is	,	now	why	should	we	get	a	little	bit	more	active	on	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	the	fundamental	answer	is	that	the	pro	-	aging	trance	is	not	 a 	 s 	 	dumb	 a 	 s 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 sens 	 ible 	 	way	of	 cop 	 ing 	 	with	the	 inevit 	 ability 	 	of	aging	.
aging	is	 ghast 	 ly 	 	,	but	it	's	 inevit 	 able 	 	,	so	,	you	know	,	we	've	got	to	find	some	way	to	put	it	out	of	our	 mind 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	rational	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	might	want	to	do	,	to	do	that	.
like	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	making	up	these	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	why	aging	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	good	thing	after	all	.
but	of	course	,	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	when	we	have	both	of	these	 component 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	the	 inevit 	 ability 	 	bit	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	 un 	 clear 	 	--	and	we	might	be	in	range	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	aging	--	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	part	of	the	problem	.
 th 	 is 	 	pro	-	aging	trance	is	what	 stop 	 s 	 	us	from	 agit 	 ating 	 	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	why	we	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	a	lot	--	 evangel 	 ize 	 	,	i	will	go	so	far	 a 	 s 	 	to	say	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	--	in	order	to	get	people	's	attention	,	and	make	people	 real 	 ize 	 	that	they	are	in	a	trance	in	 th 	 is 	 	regard	.
so	that	's	all	i	'm	going	to	say	about	that	.
i	'm	now	going	to	talk	about	 feas 	 ibility 	 	.
and	the	fundamental	reason	,	i	think	,	why	we	feel	that	aging	is	 inevit 	 able 	 	is	 summ 	 ed 	 	up	in	a	definition	of	aging	that	i	'm	giving	here	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	definition	.
aging	is	a	side	effect	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	in	the	first	place	,	which	is	to	say	,	 metabol 	 ism 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 t 	 auto 	 logical 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	;	it	's	a	 reason 	 able 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	.
aging	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	process	that	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 in 	 animate 	 	 object 	 s 	 	like	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	us	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	we	have	a	lot	of	clever	self	-	repair	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	self	-	repair	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	are	not	perfect	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 metabol 	 ism 	 	,	which	is	defined	 a 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 keep 	 s 	 	us	 al 	 ive 	 	from	one	day	to	the	next	,	 ha 	 s 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	cause	 path 	 ology 	 	.
that	's	a	fine	definition	.	so	we	can	put	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	:	we	can	say	that	,	you	know	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	chain	of	 event 	 s 	 	.
and	there	are	 re 	 ally 	 	two	 game 	 s 	 	in	town	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	most	people	,	with	regard	to	 post 	 po 	 ning 	 	aging	.
they	're	what	i	'm	 call 	 ing 	 	here	the	``	 ger 	 onto 	 logy 	 	approach	``	and	the	``	 geriatric 	 s 	 	approach	.	``
the	 geriatric 	 ian 	 	will	 inter 	 vene 	 	late	in	the	day	,	when	 path 	 ology 	 	is	 be 	 coming 	 	evident	,	and	the	 geriatric 	 ian 	 	will	try	and	hold	back	the	 sand 	 s 	 	of	time	,	and	stop	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	side	 effect 	 s 	 	from	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	 path 	 ology 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	so	soon	.
of	course	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	-	term	-	ist	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	;	it	's	a	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	battle	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	 path 	 ology 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	more	abundant	 a 	 s 	 	time	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
the	 ger 	 onto 	 logy 	 	approach	 look 	 s 	 	much	more	promising	on	the	surface	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	 prevent 	 ion 	 	is	better	than	cure	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	the	thing	is	that	we	do	n't	understand	 metabol 	 ism 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
in	fact	,	we	have	a	 pit 	 i 	 fully 	 	poor	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	how	 organism 	 s 	 	work	--	even	 cell 	 s 	 	we	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	too	good	on	yet	.
we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	rna	 inter 	 ference 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	fundamental	component	of	how	 cell 	 s 	 	work	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 ger 	 onto 	 logy 	 	is	a	fine	approach	in	the	end	,	but	it	is	not	an	approach	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	time	 ha 	 s 	 	come	when	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	intervention	.
so	then	,	what	do	we	do	about	that	?
i	mean	,	that	's	a	fine	logic	,	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	convincing	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	 iron 	 clad 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	?
but	it	is	n't	.
before	i	tell	you	why	it	is	n't	,	i	'm	going	to	go	a	little	bit	 in 	 to 	 	what	i	'm	 call 	 ing 	 	step	two	.
just	suppose	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	that	we	do	 acquir 	 e 	 	--	let	's	say	we	do	it	 to 	 day 	 	for	the	sake	of	argument	--	the	ability	to	confer	30	extra	 year 	 s 	 	of	 health 	 y 	 	life	on	people	who	are	 al 	 ready 	 	in	middle	age	,	let	's	say	55	.
i	'm	going	to	call	that	``	 ro 	 bust 	 	human	 rejuve 	 nation 	 	.	``	ok	.
what	would	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	mean	for	how	long	people	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	 age 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	or	 equi 	 valent 	 ly 	 	,	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	 age 	 s 	 	at	the	time	that	these	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	 arriv 	 e 	 	--	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	live	?
in	order	to	answer	that	question	--	you	might	think	it	's	simple	,	but	it	's	not	simple	.
we	ca	n't	just	say	,	``	well	,	if	they	're	young	 en 	 ough 	 	to	benefit	from	these	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	then	they	'll	live	30	 year 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	.	``
that	's	the	wrong	answer	.
and	the	reason	it	's	the	wrong	answer	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	progress	.
there	are	two	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	progress	 re 	 ally 	 	,	for	 th 	 is 	 	purpose	.
there	are	fundamental	,	major	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	,	and	there	are	 increment 	 al 	 	 refine 	 ments 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	.
now	,	they	differ	a	great	deal	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 predict 	 ability 	 	of	time	 frame 	 s 	 	.
fundamental	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	:	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	predict	how	long	it	's	going	to	take	to	make	a	fundamental	 break 	 through 	 	.
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	ago	that	we	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 fly 	 ing 	 	would	be	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	it	took	us	 un 	 til 	 	1903	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	out	how	to	do	it	.
but	after	that	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 stead 	 y 	 	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	uniform	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 reason 	 able 	 	sequence	of	 event 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	the	technology	of	powered	flight	.
we	can	think	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	that	each	one	is	sort	of	beyond	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	of	the	inventor	of	the	previous	one	,	if	you	like	.
the	 increment 	 al 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	have	 add 	 ed 	 	up	to	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	not	 increment 	 al 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sort	of	thing	you	see	after	a	fundamental	 break 	 through 	 	.
and	you	see	it	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
 computer 	 s 	 	:	you	can	look	at	a	more	or	less	parallel	time	line	,	 happen 	 ing 	 	of	course	a	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	.
you	can	look	at	medical	care	.	i	mean	,	 hygien 	 e 	 	,	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	the	same	sort	of	time	frame	.
so	i	think	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	step	two	,	that	i	 call 	 ed 	 	a	step	a	moment	ago	,	is	n't	a	step	at	all	.
that	in	fact	,	the	people	who	are	young	 en 	 ough 	 	to	benefit	from	these	first	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	that	give	 th 	 is 	 	moderate	amount	of	life	 extens 	 ion 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	 al 	 ready 	 	middle	-	aged	when	the	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	 arriv 	 e 	 	,	will	be	at	some	sort	of	 cus 	 p 	 	.
they	will	 most 	 ly 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	 treat 	 ments 	 	that	will	give	them	a	further	30	or	 may 	 be 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	they	will	be	 stay 	 ing 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	game	.
the	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	will	be	 improv 	 ing 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	 im 	 perfect 	 ions 	 	in	the	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	are	 catch 	 ing 	 	up	with	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	point	for	me	to	get	 a 	 cross 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	most	people	,	when	they	hear	that	i	predict	that	a	lot	of	people	 al 	 ive 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	going	to	live	to	1,000	or	more	,	they	think	that	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	're	going	to	invent	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	in	the	next	few	 decade 	 s 	 	that	are	so	 thorough 	 ly 	 	 elimi 	 nating 	 	aging	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	will	let	us	live	to	1,000	or	more	.
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	at	all	.
i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	that	the	rate	of	 improve 	 ment 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	will	be	 en 	 ough 	 	.
they	'll	never	be	perfect	,	but	we	'll	be	able	to	fix	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	200	-	year	-	olds	die	of	,	before	we	have	any	200	-	year	-	olds	.
and	the	same	for	300	and	400	and	so	on	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	a	little	name	,	which	is	``	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	 es 	 cape 	 	 velo 	 city 	 	.	``
well	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	get	the	point	 a 	 cross 	 	.
so	,	these	 tra 	 ject 	 ories 	 	here	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	how	we	would	expect	people	to	live	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 remain 	 ing 	 	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	health	,	for	 give 	 n 	 	 age 	 s 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	time	that	these	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	 arriv 	 e 	 	.
if	you	're	 al 	 ready 	 	100	,	or	even	if	you	're	80	--	and	an	average	80	-	year	-	old	,	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	ca	n't	do	a	lot	for	you	with	these	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	too	close	to	death	's	door	for	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 initi 	 al 	 	,	 experiment 	 al 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	to	be	good	 en 	 ough 	 	for	you	.
you	wo	n't	be	able	to	 with 	 stand 	 	them	.
but	if	you	're	 on 	 ly 	 	50	,	then	there	's	a	chance	that	you	might	be	able	to	pull	out	of	the	 d 	 ive 	 	and	,	you	know	--	--	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	get	through	 th 	 is 	 	and	start	 be 	 coming 	 	 bio 	 logically 	 	 young 	 er 	 	in	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	sense	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	your	 youth 	 fulness 	 	,	both	physical	and	mental	,	and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	your	risk	of	death	from	age	-	related	 cause 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	if	you	're	a	bit	 young 	 er 	 	than	that	,	then	you	're	never	 re 	 ally 	 	even	going	to	get	near	to	 be 	 ing 	 	fragile	 en 	 ough 	 	to	die	of	age	-	related	 cause 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	genuine	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	i	come	to	,	that	the	first	150	-	year	-	old	--	we	do	n't	know	how	old	that	person	is	 to 	 day 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	know	how	long	it	's	going	to	take	to	get	these	first	-	generation	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	.
but	 ir 	 respect 	 ive 	 	of	that	age	,	i	'm	 claim 	 ing 	 	that	the	first	person	to	live	to	1,000	--	subject	of	course	,	to	,	you	know	,	global	 catastroph 	 es 	 	--	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	 young 	 er 	 	than	the	first	150	-	year	-	old	.
and	that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	thought	.
 al 	 right 	 	,	so	 final 	 ly 	 	i	'm	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	rest	of	the	talk	,	my	last	seven	-	and	-	a	-	half	 minute 	 s 	 	,	on	step	one	;	 name 	 ly 	 	,	how	do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	moderate	amount	of	life	 extens 	 ion 	 	that	will	allow	us	to	get	to	 es 	 cape 	 	 velo 	 city 	 	?
and	in	order	to	do	that	,	i	need	to	talk	about	 mic 	 e 	 	a	little	bit	.
i	have	a	 correspond 	 ing 	 	 mile 	 stone 	 	to	 ro 	 bust 	 	human	 rejuve 	 nation 	 	.
i	'm	 call 	 ing 	 	it	``	 ro 	 bust 	 	mouse	 rejuve 	 nation 	 	,	``	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 imagin 	 ative 	 ly 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	is	.
i	say	we	're	going	to	take	a	long	-	lived	 s 	 train 	 	of	mouse	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 mic 	 e 	 	that	live	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	on	average	.
we	do	 exact 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	them	 un 	 til 	 	they	're	 al 	 ready 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	then	we	do	a	whole	bunch	of	stuff	to	them	,	and	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	we	get	them	to	live	,	on	average	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	fifth	 birth 	 day 	 	.
so	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	add	two	 year 	 s 	 	--	we	treble	 the 	 ir 	 	 remain 	 ing 	 	 life 	 span 	 	,	 start 	 ing 	 	from	the	point	that	we	 start 	 ed 	 	the	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	.
the	question	then	is	,	what	would	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	mean	for	the	time	frame	 un 	 til 	 	we	get	to	the	 mile 	 stone 	 	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	for	 human 	 s 	 	?
which	we	can	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 explain 	 ed 	 	,	 equi 	 valent 	 ly 	 	call	either	 ro 	 bust 	 	human	 rejuve 	 nation 	 	or	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	 es 	 cape 	 	 velo 	 city 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	for	the	public	's	 per 	 ception 	 	of	how	long	it	's	going	to	take	for	us	to	get	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 start 	 ing 	 	from	the	time	we	get	the	 mic 	 e 	 	?
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	the	question	is	,	what	will	it	do	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	how	much	people	want	it	?
and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	the	first	question	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	a	biology	question	,	and	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	hard	to	answer	.
one	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 specul 	 ative 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	would	say	that	we	should	not	do	 th 	 is 	 	 specul 	 ation 	 	,	that	we	should	 simpl 	 y 	 	keep	our	counsel	 un 	 til 	 	we	know	more	.
i	say	that	's	 non 	 sense 	 	.
i	say	we	 absolute 	 ly 	 	are	 ir 	 respons 	 ible 	 	if	we	stay	silent	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	need	to	give	our	best	guess	 a 	 s 	 	to	the	time	frame	,	in	order	to	give	people	a	sense	of	proportion	so	that	they	can	assess	 the 	 ir 	 	 prior 	 ities 	 	.
so	,	i	say	that	we	have	a	50/50	chance	of	 reach 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	rhr	 mile 	 stone 	 	,	 ro 	 bust 	 	human	 rejuve 	 nation 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	from	the	point	that	we	get	to	 ro 	 bust 	 	mouse	 rejuve 	 nation 	 	.
15	 year 	 s 	 	from	the	 ro 	 bust 	 	mouse	.
the	public	's	 per 	 ception 	 	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	 some 	 what 	 	better	than	that	.
the	public	 tend 	 s 	 	to	 under 	 estimate 	 	how	difficult	scientific	 thing 	 s 	 	are	.
so	they	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	it	's	five	 year 	 s 	 	away	.
they	'll	be	wrong	,	but	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	wo	n't	matter	too	much	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	of	course	,	i	think	it	's	fair	to	say	that	a	large	part	of	the	reason	why	the	public	is	so	 ambi 	 valent 	 	about	aging	now	is	the	global	trance	i	spoke	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	the	 cop 	 ing 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
that	will	be	 histo 	 ry 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	no	 long 	 er 	 	be	possible	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	aging	is	 inevit 	 able 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	since	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 postpone 	 d 	 	so	 ver 	 y 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	in	 mic 	 e 	 	.
so	we	're	 like 	 ly 	 	to	end	up	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	change	in	people	's	 attitude 	 s 	 	,	and	of	course	that	 ha 	 s 	 	enormous	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
so	in	order	to	tell	you	now	how	we	're	going	to	get	these	 mic 	 e 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	add	a	little	bit	to	my	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	aging	.
i	'm	going	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	word	``	damage	``	to	 de 	 note 	 	these	 inter 	 mediate 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 metabol 	 ism 	 	and	that	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	cause	 path 	 ology 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	critical	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	damage	 on 	 ly 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	 path 	 ology 	 	,	the	damage	 it 	 self 	 	is	 caus 	 ed 	 	 on 	 going 	 	-	ly	 through 	 out 	 	life	,	 start 	 ing 	 	before	we	're	born	.
but	it	is	not	part	of	 metabol 	 ism 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 use 	 ful 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	re	-	draw	our	original	 dia 	 gram 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
we	can	say	that	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 ger 	 onto 	 logy 	 	and	 geriatric 	 s 	 	is	that	 ger 	 onto 	 logy 	 	tries	to	inhibit	the	rate	at	which	 metabol 	 ism 	 	 lay 	 s 	 	down	 th 	 is 	 	damage	.
and	i	'm	going	to	explain	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	damage	is	in	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 term 	 s 	 	in	a	moment	.
and	 geriatric 	 ians 	 	try	to	hold	back	the	 sand 	 s 	 	of	time	by	 stop 	 ping 	 	the	damage	 convert 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 path 	 ology 	 	.
and	the	reason	it	's	a	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	battle	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	damage	is	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
so	there	's	a	third	approach	,	if	we	look	at	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
we	can	call	it	the	``	 engineer 	 ing 	 	approach	,	``	and	i	claim	that	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	approach	is	 with 	 in 	 	range	.
the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	approach	 do 	 es 	 	not	 inter 	 vene 	 	in	any	 process 	 es 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	not	 inter 	 vene 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	process	or	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
and	that	's	good	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	's	not	a	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	battle	,	and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	are	 with 	 in 	 	range	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	involve	 improv 	 ing 	 	on	evolution	.
the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	approach	 simpl 	 y 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	let	's	go	and	 period 	 ically 	 	repair	all	of	these	 vari 	 ous 	 	 type 	 s 	 	of	damage	--	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	repair	them	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	but	repair	them	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	,	so	that	we	keep	the	level	of	damage	down	 be 	 low 	 	the	threshold	that	must	exist	,	that	 cause 	 s 	 	it	to	be	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	.	``
we	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	threshold	 exist 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	get	age	-	related	 disease 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	we	're	in	middle	age	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	damage	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 accumul 	 ating 	 	since	before	we	 we 	 re 	 	born	.
why	do	i	say	that	we	're	in	range	?	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	.
the	point	about	 th 	 is 	 	slide	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	bottom	.
if	we	try	to	say	which	bits	of	 metabol 	 ism 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	for	aging	,	we	will	be	here	all	night	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	all	of	 metabol 	 ism 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	for	aging	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	list	is	just	for	 illustr 	 ation 	 	;	it	is	 in 	 complete 	 	.
the	list	on	the	right	is	 al 	 so 	 	 in 	 complete 	 	.
it	's	a	list	of	 type 	 s 	 	of	 path 	 ology 	 	that	are	age	-	related	,	and	it	's	just	an	 in 	 complete 	 	list	.
but	i	would	like	to	claim	to	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	list	in	the	middle	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	complete	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	list	of	 type 	 s 	 	of	thing	that	 qual 	 ify 	 	 a 	 s 	 	damage	,	side	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 metabol 	 ism 	 	that	cause	 path 	 ology 	 	in	the	end	,	or	that	might	cause	 path 	 ology 	 	.
and	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	seven	of	them	.
they	're	 categor 	 ies 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	but	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	seven	of	them	.
cell	loss	,	 mutation 	 s 	 	in	 chromosom 	 es 	 	,	 mutation 	 s 	 	in	the	mitochondria	and	so	on	.
first	of	all	,	i	'd	like	to	give	you	an	argument	for	why	that	list	is	complete	.
of	course	one	can	make	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	argument	.
one	can	say	,	``	ok	,	what	are	we	made	of	?	``
we	're	made	of	 cell 	 s 	 	and	stuff	between	 cell 	 s 	 	.
what	can	damage	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	?
the	answer	is	:	long	-	lived	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	a	short	-	lived	molecule	 under 	 go 	 es 	 	damage	,	but	then	the	molecule	is	 destroy 	 ed 	 	--	like	by	a	protein	 be 	 ing 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	 proteo 	 lysis 	 	--	then	the	damage	is	gone	,	too	.
it	's	got	to	be	long	-	lived	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
so	,	these	seven	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	under	 discuss 	 ion 	 	in	 ger 	 onto 	 logy 	 	a	long	time	ago	and	that	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	news	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	,	you	know	,	we	've	come	a	long	way	in	biology	in	these	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	so	the	fact	that	we	have	n't	 extend 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	list	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 indic 	 ation 	 	that	there	's	no	 extens 	 ion 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	it	's	better	than	that	;	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	how	to	fix	them	all	,	in	 mic 	 e 	 	,	in	principle	--	and	what	i	mean	by	in	principle	is	,	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	implement	these	 fix 	 es 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	.
some	of	them	are	 partial 	 ly 	 	 implement 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	at	the	top	.
i	have	n't	got	time	to	go	through	them	at	all	,	but	my	 con 	 clusion 	 	is	that	,	if	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 suit 	 able 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	then	we	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	develop	 ro 	 bust 	 	mouse	 rejuve 	 nation 	 	in	 on 	 ly 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	we	do	need	to	get	serious	about	it	.
we	do	need	to	 re 	 ally 	 	start	 try 	 ing 	 	.
so	of	course	,	there	are	some	 biologist 	 s 	 	in	the	audience	,	and	i	want	to	give	some	 answer 	 s 	 	to	some	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	you	may	have	.
you	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	 dis 	 satisfied 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	but	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	you	have	to	go	and	read	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
i	've	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	great	deal	on	 th 	 is 	 	;	i	cite	the	 experiment 	 al 	 	work	on	which	my	 optim 	 ism 	 	is	based	,	and	there	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	detail	there	.
the	detail	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	me	confident	of	my	 ra 	 ther 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	time	 frame 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 predict 	 ing 	 	here	.
so	if	you	think	that	i	'm	wrong	,	you	'd	better	damn	well	go	and	find	out	why	you	think	i	'm	wrong	.
and	of	course	the	main	thing	is	that	you	should	n't	trust	people	who	call	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 ger 	 onto 	 logists 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	any	radical	 depart 	 ure 	 	from	previous	 think 	 ing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	field	,	you	know	,	you	expect	people	in	the	 main 	 stream 	 	to	be	a	bit	resistant	and	not	 re 	 ally 	 	to	take	it	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	you	know	,	you	've	got	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	your	 home 	 work 	 	,	in	order	to	understand	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	.
and	we	'll	just	end	with	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	thing	is	,	you	know	,	you	'll	be	 hear 	 ing 	 	from	a	guy	in	the	next	session	who	 s 	 aid 	 	some	time	ago	that	he	could	sequence	the	human	genome	in	half	no	time	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	it	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.	``
and	you	know	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	happen	.
we	have	 vari 	 ous 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	--	there	's	the	methuselah	mouse	prize	,	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	incentive	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	,	and	to	do	what	you	think	is	going	to	work	,	and	you	get	money	for	it	if	you	win	.
there	's	a	proposal	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	together	an	institute	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	going	to	take	a	bit	of	money	.
but	,	i	mean	,	look	--	how	long	 do 	 es 	 	it	take	to	 s 	 pend 	 	that	on	the	war	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	?
not	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.	ok	.
it	's	got	to	be	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 profit 	 s 	 	distract	 bio 	 tech 	 	,	but	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	got	a	90	percent	chance	,	i	think	,	of	 succeed 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	think	we	know	how	to	do	it	.	and	i	'll	stop	there	.
thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	ok	.	i	do	n't	know	if	there	's	going	to	be	any	 question 	 s 	 	but	i	thought	i	would	give	people	the	chance	.
audience	:	since	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	aging	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	defeat	it	,	why	is	it	that	you	make	 your 	 self 	 	appear	like	an	old	man	?
ag	:	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	an	old	man	.	i	am	 actual 	 ly 	 	158	.
audience	:	species	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	with	 immun 	 e 	 	 system 	 s 	 	to	fight	off	all	the	 disease 	 s 	 	so	that	 individual 	 s 	 	live	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 pro 	 create 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	know	,	all	the	species	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	die	,	so	when	 cell 	 s 	 	divide	,	the	telomerase	get	 short 	 er 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	species	die	.
so	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	--	evolution	 ha 	 s 	 	--	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	 select 	 ed 	 	against	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	when	it	is	so	 advantage 	 ous 	 	,	or	is	evolution	just	 in 	 complete 	 	?
ag	:	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.	thank	you	for	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	question	that	i	can	answer	with	an	 un 	 controversial 	 	answer	.
i	'm	going	to	tell	you	the	genuine	 main 	 stream 	 	answer	to	your	question	,	which	i	happen	to	agree	with	,	which	is	that	,	no	,	aging	is	not	a	product	of	 s 	 election 	 	,	evolution	;	[	aging	]	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	product	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	neglect	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	have	aging	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	hard	work	not	to	have	aging	;	you	need	more	genetic	 path 	 ways 	 	,	more	 sophistic 	 ation 	 	in	your	 gene 	 s 	 	in	order	to	age	more	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	and	that	 car 	 ries 	 	on	 be 	 ing 	 	true	the	 long 	 er 	 	you	push	it	out	.
so	,	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	that	evolution	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	 whet 	 her 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	are	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	by	 individual 	 s 	 	,	living	a	long	time	or	by	 pro 	 creation 	 	,	there	's	a	certain	amount	of	 modul 	 ation 	 	of	that	,	which	is	why	different	species	have	different	 life 	 span 	 s 	 	,	but	that	's	why	there	are	no	 im 	 mortal 	 	species	.
ca	:	the	 gene 	 s 	 	do	n't	care	but	we	do	?
ag	:	that	's	right	.
audience	:	 hell 	 o 	 	.	i	read	 some 	 where 	 	that	in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	average	 life 	 span 	 	of	 bas 	 ically 	 	 any 	 one 	 	on	the	planet	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	by	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	i	project	that	,	that	would	make	me	think	that	i	would	live	 un 	 til 	 	120	if	i	do	n't	crash	on	my	 motor 	 bike 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	one	of	your	 subject 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	1,000	-	year	-	old	?
ag	:	if	you	lose	a	bit	of	weight	.
your	 number 	 s 	 	are	a	bit	out	.
the	standard	 number 	 s 	 	are	that	 life 	 span 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	growing	at	between	one	and	two	 year 	 s 	 	per	decade	.
so	,	it	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	you	might	think	,	you	might	hope	.
but	i	intend	to	move	it	up	to	one	year	per	year	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
audience	:	i	was	told	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	we	have	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	human	embryo	,	and	that	the	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	last	80	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	.
if	that	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	true	,	 bio 	 logically 	 	are	there	 implic 	 ations 	 	in	the	world	of	 rejuve 	 nation 	 	?
if	there	are	 cell 	 s 	 	in	my	body	that	live	all	80	 year 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	a	typical	,	you	know	,	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	?
ag	:	there	are	technical	 implic 	 ations 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	what	we	need	to	do	is	replace	 cell 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	few	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	that	lose	 cell 	 s 	 	at	a	 respect 	 able 	 	rate	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	want	to	replace	them	any	 fast 	 er 	 	than	that	--	or	not	much	 fast 	 er 	 	 any 	 way 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 re 	 placing 	 	them	too	fast	would	 de 	 grade 	 	cognitive	function	.
what	i	 s 	 aid 	 	about	there	 be 	 ing 	 	no	non	-	aging	species	 ear 	 lier 	 	on	was	a	little	bit	of	an	 over 	 simpl 	 ification 	 	.
there	are	species	that	have	no	aging	--	hydra	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	but	they	do	it	by	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	nervous	system	--	and	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	any	 tissue 	 s 	 	in	fact	that	 re 	 ly 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	function	on	 ver 	 y 	 	long	-	lived	 cell 	 s 	 	.
