we	invent	.
my	company	 invent 	 s 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	new	technology	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 area 	 s 	 	.
and	we	do	that	for	a	couple	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
we	invent	for	 f 	 un 	 	--	 invent 	 ion 	 	is	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	to	do	--	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	invent	for	profit	.
the	two	are	related	 be 	 cause 	 	the	profit	 actual 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	long	 en 	 ough 	 	that	if	it	is	n't	 f 	 un 	 	,	you	would	n't	have	the	time	to	do	it	.
so	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	 f 	 un 	 	and	profit	-	oriented	 invent 	 ing 	 	for	most	of	what	we	do	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	program	where	we	invent	for	 human 	 ity 	 	--	where	we	take	some	of	our	best	 inventor 	 s 	 	,	and	we	say	,	``	are	there	 problem 	 s 	 	where	we	have	a	good	idea	for	solving	a	problem	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	?	``	--	and	to	solve	it	in	the	way	we	try	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	,	which	is	with	 dramat 	 ic 	 	,	crazy	,	out	-	of	-	the	-	box	 solution 	 s 	 	.
bill	 gate 	 s 	 	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 smart 	 est 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 	that	work	on	these	 problem 	 s 	 	and	he	 al 	 so 	 	 fund 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	so	thank	you	.
so	i	'm	going	to	 brief 	 ly 	 	discuss	a	couple	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	and	a	couple	of	 problem 	 s 	 	where	we	've	got	some	 solution 	 s 	 	 under 	 way 	 	.
 vaccin 	 ation 	 	is	one	of	the	key	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	in	public	health	,	a	fantastic	thing	.
but	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	a	lot	of	 vaccin 	 es 	 	spoil	before	they	're	 administer 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	they	need	to	be	 ke 	 pt 	 	cold	.
 al 	 most 	 	all	 vaccin 	 es 	 	need	to	be	 ke 	 pt 	 	at	 refrige 	 rator 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	.
they	go	bad	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	if	you	do	n't	,	and	if	you	do	n't	have	 s 	 table 	 	power	grid	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	,	so	 kid 	 s 	 	die	.
it	's	not	just	the	loss	of	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	that	 matter 	 s 	 	;	it	's	the	fact	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	do	n't	get	 vaccin 	 ated 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	ways	that	 vaccin 	 es 	 	are	carried	:	these	are	styrofoam	 chest 	 s 	 	.	these	are	 be 	 ing 	 	carried	by	people	,	but	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	put	on	the	 back 	 s 	 	of	 pick 	 up 	 	 truck 	 s 	 	.
we	've	got	a	different	solution	.
now	,	one	of	these	styrofoam	 chest 	 s 	 	will	last	for	about	four	 hour 	 s 	 	with	ice	in	it	.
and	we	thought	,	well	,	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
so	we	made	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	 last 	 s 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	with	no	power	;	 absolute 	 ly 	 	zero	power	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 lose 	 s 	 	less	than	a	half	a	watt	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	second	 generation 	 s 	 	prototype	.
the	third	generation	prototype	is	,	right	now	,	in	uganda	 be 	 ing 	 	tested	.
now	,	the	reason	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	come	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	two	key	 idea 	 s 	 	:	one	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	similar	to	a	 cryo 	 genic 	 	dewar	,	 some 	 thing 	 	you	'd	keep	liquid	nitrogen	or	liquid	 hel 	 ium 	 	in	.
they	have	 in 	 credible 	 	 insula 	 tion 	 	,	so	let	's	put	some	 in 	 credible 	 	 insula 	 tion 	 	here	.
the	other	idea	is	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	,	you	ca	n't	reach	 in 	 side 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	open	it	up	and	reach	 in 	 side 	 	,	you	'd	let	the	heat	in	,	the	game	would	be	over	.
so	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 co 	 ke 	 	machine	.
it	 vend 	 s 	 	out	little	individual	 vial 	 s 	 	.
so	a	simple	idea	,	which	we	hope	is	going	to	change	the	way	 vaccin 	 es 	 	are	 distribut 	 ed 	 	in	africa	and	around	the	world	.
we	'll	move	on	to	malaria	.
malaria	is	one	of	the	great	public	health	 problem 	 s 	 	.
esther	duflo	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
two	hundred	million	people	a	year	.
every	43	 second 	 s 	 	a	child	in	africa	dies	;	27	will	die	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	talk	.
and	there	's	no	way	for	us	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	to	grasp	 re 	 ally 	 	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	to	the	people	 involve 	 d 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	comment	of	esther	's	was	that	we	react	when	there	's	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	like	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	but	that	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	is	 on 	 going 	 	.
so	what	can	we	do	about	it	?
well	,	there	are	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	people	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	for	solving	malaria	.
you	can	spray	;	the	problem	is	there	are	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
you	can	try	to	treat	people	and	create	 aware 	 ness 	 	.
that	's	great	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	have	malaria	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	,	they	do	n't	have	health	care	 system 	 s 	 	.
a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	would	be	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	thing	,	 on 	 ly 	 	they	do	n't	work	yet	.
people	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	for	a	long	time	.	there	are	a	couple	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 candid 	 ates 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	thing	to	make	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	for	.
you	can	 distribut 	 e 	 	bed	 net 	 s 	 	,	and	bed	 net 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	if	you	use	them	.
you	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	use	them	for	that	.	people	fish	with	them	.
they	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	get	to	 every 	 one 	 	.
and	bed	 net 	 s 	 	have	an	effect	on	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	,	but	you	're	never	going	to	make	it	extinct	with	bed	 net 	 s 	 	.
now	,	malaria	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	disease	.
we	could	 s 	 pend 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	going	over	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	got	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	soap	opera	-	like	 life 	 style 	 	;	they	have	 s 	 ex 	 	,	they	burrow	 in 	 to 	 	your	liver	,	they	tunnel	 in 	 to 	 	your	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	...
it	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	disease	,	but	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	find	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	it	and	why	we	work	on	malaria	:	there	's	a	lot	of	potential	ways	in	.
one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	ways	might	be	better	 diagnos 	 is 	 	.
so	we	hope	 th 	 is 	 	year	to	prototype	each	of	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
one	 do 	 es 	 	an	 autom 	 atic 	 	malaria	 diagnos 	 is 	 	in	the	same	way	that	a	diabetic	's	glucose	meter	 work 	 s 	 	:	you	take	a	drop	of	blood	,	you	put	it	in	there	and	it	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	you	need	to	do	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	procedure	,	create	a	bunch	of	 micro 	 scope 	 	 slide 	 s 	 	and	have	a	trained	person	examine	it	.
the	other	thing	is	,	you	know	,	it	would	be	even	better	if	you	did	n't	have	to	draw	the	blood	.
and	if	you	look	through	the	eye	,	or	you	look	at	the	 vessel 	 s 	 	on	the	white	of	the	eye	,	in	fact	,	you	may	be	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	any	blood	at	all	,	or	through	your	nail	 bed 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	through	your	 finger 	 nail 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	,	and	once	you	see	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	,	we	think	we	can	see	the	malaria	.
we	can	see	it	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	 call 	 ed 	 	hemozoin	.
it	's	 produce 	 d 	 	by	the	malaria	 parasit 	 e 	 	and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 crystall 	 ine 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 	.
 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	if	you	're	a	solid	-	state	physicist	.
there	's	a	lot	of	cool	stuff	we	can	do	with	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	 femto 	 second 	 	laser	lab	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 create 	 s 	 	 puls 	 es 	 	of	light	that	last	a	 femto 	 second 	 	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	short	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 puls 	 e 	 	of	light	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	one	 wave 	 length 	 	of	light	long	,	so	it	's	a	whole	bunch	of	 photo 	 ns 	 	all	coming	and	hitting	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
it	 create 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	peak	power	and	it	lets	you	do	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	;	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	it	lets	you	find	hemozoin	.
so	here	's	an	image	of	red	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	now	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	map	where	the	hemozoin	and	where	the	malaria	 parasit 	 es 	 	are	 in 	 side 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	red	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	using	both	 th 	 is 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	and	other	optical	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	,	we	think	we	can	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 an 	 other 	 	hemozoin	-	oriented	therapy	for	malaria	:	a	way	,	in	 a 	 cute 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	the	malaria	 parasit 	 e 	 	and	filter	it	out	of	the	blood	system	.
sort	of	like	 do 	 ing 	 	 dia 	 lysis 	 	,	but	for	 reliev 	 ing 	 	the	 parasit 	 e 	 	load	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	thousand	-	core	 super 	 computer 	 	.
we	're	kind	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	and	so	 near 	 ly 	 	any	problem	that	you	pose	,	we	like	to	try	to	solve	with	some	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	you	have	if	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	malaria	or	 reduc 	 e 	 	it	is	you	do	n't	know	what	's	the	most	effective	thing	to	do	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	heard	about	bed	 net 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
you	 s 	 pend 	 	a	certain	amount	per	bed	net	.
or	you	could	spray	.
you	can	give	drug	 administr 	 ation 	 	.
there	's	all	these	different	 intervention 	 s 	 	but	they	have	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 effective 	 ness 	 	.
how	can	you	tell	?
so	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	,	using	our	 super 	 computer 	 	,	the	world	's	best	computer	model	of	malaria	,	which	we	'll	show	you	now	.
we	 pick 	 ed 	 	madagascar	.
we	have	every	road	,	every	village	,	every	,	 al 	 most 	 	,	square	inch	of	madagascar	.
we	have	all	of	the	 precipit 	 ation 	 	data	and	the	temperature	data	.
that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	and	 precipit 	 ation 	 	tell	you	 whet 	 her 	 	you	've	got	 stand 	 ing 	 	 pool 	 s 	 	of	water	for	the	 mosquito 	 es 	 	to	breed	.
so	that	 set 	 s 	 	the	stage	on	which	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	then	have	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	the	 mosquito 	 es 	 	,	and	you	have	to	model	that	and	how	they	come	and	go	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	malaria	 spread 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	madagascar	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 lat 	 ter 	 	part	of	the	 rain 	 y 	 	season	.
we	're	going	to	the	dry	season	now	.
it	 near 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	away	in	the	dry	season	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	place	for	the	 mosquito 	 es 	 	to	breed	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	the	next	year	it	 come 	 s 	 	 roar 	 ing 	 	back	.
by	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 simul 	 ations 	 	,	we	want	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	or	control	malaria	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	in	 soft 	 ware 	 	before	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	do	it	in	real	life	;	to	be	able	to	 simul 	 ate 	 	both	the	economic	trade	-	offs	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	bed	 net 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	how	much	 spray 	 ing 	 	?	--	or	the	social	trade	-	offs	--	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	 un 	 rest 	 	 break 	 s 	 	out	?
we	 al 	 so 	 	try	to	 stud 	 y 	 	our	foe	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	high	-	speed	camera	view	of	a	mosquito	.
and	,	in	a	moment	,	we	're	going	to	see	a	view	of	the	 air 	 flow 	 	.
here	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	the	 air 	 flow 	 	around	the	 wing 	 s 	 	of	the	mosquito	with	little	 particle 	 s 	 	we	're	 illumi 	 nating 	 	with	a	laser	.
by	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	 mosquito 	 es 	 	fly	,	we	hope	to	understand	how	to	make	them	not	fly	.
now	,	one	of	the	ways	you	can	make	them	not	fly	is	with	ddt	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	ad	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	you	just	ca	n't	make	up	.
once	 up 	 on 	 	a	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	,	and	,	in	fact	,	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	got	rid	of	malaria	through	ddt	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	did	.
in	1935	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	150,000	 case 	 s 	 	a	year	of	malaria	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	but	ddt	and	a	massive	public	health	effort	 manage 	 d 	 	to	squelch	it	.
so	we	thought	,	``	well	,	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	focused	on	the	plasmodium	,	the	 parasit 	 e 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	.
what	can	we	do	to	the	mosquito	?
well	,	let	's	try	to	kill	it	with	consumer	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.	``
now	,	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	,	but	each	of	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	in	it	that	 may 	 be 	 	you	could	use	.
your	blu	-	ray	player	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	blue	laser	.
your	laser	 print 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mirror	 galvan 	 o 	 meter 	 	that	's	used	to	steer	a	laser	beam	 ver 	 y 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	;	that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 dot 	 s 	 	on	the	page	.
and	,	of	course	,	there	's	signal	 process 	 ing 	 	and	digital	 camera 	 s 	 	.
so	what	if	we	could	put	all	that	together	to	shoot	them	out	of	the	sky	with	 laser 	 s 	 	?
now	,	in	our	company	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	call	``	the	 pink 	 y 	 	-	suck	moment	.	``
what	if	we	could	do	that	?
now	,	just	suspend	 dis 	 belief 	 	for	a	moment	,	and	let	's	think	of	what	could	happen	if	we	could	do	that	.
well	,	we	could	protect	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	value	 target 	 s 	 	like	 clinic 	 s 	 	.
 clinic 	 s 	 	are	full	of	people	that	have	malaria	.
they	're	sick	,	and	so	they	're	less	able	to	defend	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	 mosquito 	 es 	 	.
you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	protect	them	.
of	course	,	if	you	do	that	,	you	could	 al 	 so 	 	protect	your	 back 	 yard 	 	.
and	 farm 	 ers 	 	could	protect	 the 	 ir 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	that	they	want	to	sell	to	whole	 food 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 photo 	 ns 	 	are	100	percent	 organ 	 ic 	 	.
they	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	natural	.
now	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	better	than	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	could	,	if	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	,	you	could	shine	a	 non 	 lethal 	 	laser	on	the	bug	before	you	zap	it	,	and	you	could	listen	to	the	wing	beat	frequency	and	you	could	measure	the	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	then	you	could	decide	:	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	an	insect	i	want	to	kill	,	or	an	insect	i	do	n't	want	to	kill	?	``
moore	's	law	made	computing	cheap	;	so	cheap	we	can	weigh	the	life	of	an	individual	insect	and	decide	 thumb 	 s 	 	up	or	 thumb 	 s 	 	down	.
now	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	 on 	 ly 	 	kill	the	female	 mosquito 	 es 	 	.
they	're	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
 mosquito 	 es 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	drink	blood	to	lay	 egg 	 s 	 	.
 mosquito 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	live	...	 the 	 ir 	 	day	-	to	-	day	nutrition	 come 	 s 	 	from	nectar	,	from	 flower 	 s 	 	--	in	fact	,	in	the	lab	,	we	feed	 our 	 s 	 	 raisin 	 s 	 	--	but	the	female	 need 	 s 	 	the	blood	meal	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	crazy	,	right	?
would	you	like	to	see	it	?
audience	:	 yea 	 h 	 	!
nathan	myhrvold	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	our	legal	 depart 	 ment 	 	prepared	a	 dis 	 claim 	 er 	 	,	and	here	it	is	.
now	,	after	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	a	little	bit	we	thought	,	you	know	,	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	be	 simpl 	 er 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	 non 	 lethal 	 	laser	.
so	,	eric	johanson	,	who	built	the	 de 	 vice 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	with	 part 	 s 	 	from	ebay	;	and	pablos	holman	over	here	,	he	's	got	 mosquito 	 es 	 	in	the	tank	.
we	have	the	 de 	 vice 	 	over	here	.
and	we	're	going	to	show	you	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	kill	laser	,	which	will	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	brief	,	instantaneous	 puls 	 e 	 	,	we	're	going	to	have	a	green	laser	 point 	 er 	 	that	's	going	to	stay	on	the	mosquito	for	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	period	of	time	;	 other 	 wise 	 	,	you	ca	n't	see	it	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
take	it	away	eric	.
eric	johanson	:	what	we	have	here	is	a	tank	on	the	other	side	of	the	stage	.
and	we	have	...	 th 	 is 	 	computer	screen	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	the	 mosquito 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	fly	around	.
and	pablos	,	if	he	 stir 	 s 	 	up	our	 mosquito 	 es 	 	a	little	bit	we	can	see	them	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	.
now	,	that	's	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	image	 process 	 ing 	 	routine	,	and	let	me	show	you	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
here	you	can	see	that	the	 insect 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 track 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	,	which	is	kind	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
next	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	light	them	up	with	a	laser	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	low	powered	laser	,	and	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	pick	up	a	wing	-	beat	frequency	.
so	you	may	be	able	to	hear	some	 mosquito 	 es 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	.
nm	:	that	's	a	mosquito	wing	beat	you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
ej	:	 final 	 ly 	 	,	let	's	see	what	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
there	you	can	see	 mosquito 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	fly	around	,	 be 	 ing 	 	lit	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	way	down	so	that	you	have	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	see	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
here	we	have	it	running	at	high	-	speed	mode	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	system	that	was	built	for	ted	is	here	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	that	it	is	 technical 	 ly 	 	possible	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	deploy	a	system	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	're	looking	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	at	how	to	make	it	 high 	 ly 	 	cost	-	effective	to	use	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	africa	and	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
nm	:	so	it	would	n't	be	any	 f 	 un 	 	to	show	you	that	 with 	 out 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	you	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	hit	'	em	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	first	 one 	 s 	 	we	did	.
the	energy	's	a	little	bit	high	here	.
we	'll	loop	around	here	in	just	a	second	,	and	you	'll	see	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	.	bang	.
an	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	,	we	kill	them	all	the	time	;	we	've	never	 actual 	 ly 	 	gotten	the	 wing 	 s 	 	to	shut	off	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
the	wing	motor	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 resili 	 ent 	 	.
i	mean	,	here	we	're	 blow 	 ing 	 	 wing 	 s 	 	off	but	the	wing	motor	 keep 	 s 	 	all	the	way	down	.
so	,	that	's	what	i	have	.	 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
