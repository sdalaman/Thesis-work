when	we	park	in	a	big	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	,	how	do	we	remember	where	we	 park 	 ed 	 	our	car	?
here	's	the	problem	facing	homer	.
and	we	're	going	to	try	to	understand	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	his	brain	.
so	we	'll	start	with	the	 hippo 	 campus 	 	,	 show 	 n 	 	in	yellow	,	which	is	the	organ	of	 memor 	 y 	 	.
if	you	have	damage	there	,	like	in	alzheimer	's	,	you	ca	n't	remember	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	where	you	 park 	 ed 	 	your	car	.
it	's	named	after	latin	for	``	seahorse	,	``	which	it	 resemble 	 s 	 	.
and	like	the	rest	of	the	brain	,	it	's	made	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
so	the	human	brain	 ha 	 s 	 	about	a	hundred	billion	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	it	.
and	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	communicate	with	each	other	by	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	little	 puls 	 es 	 	or	 spike 	 s 	 	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	via	 connect 	 ions 	 	to	each	other	.
the	 hippo 	 campus 	 	is	 form 	 ed 	 	of	two	 sheet 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 dense 	 ly 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	.
and	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 beg 	 un 	 	to	understand	how	spatial	 memor 	 y 	 	 work 	 s 	 	by	 record 	 ing 	 	from	individual	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	 rat 	 s 	 	or	 mic 	 e 	 	while	they	 for 	 age 	 	or	explore	an	environment	looking	for	food	.
so	we	're	going	to	imagine	we	're	 record 	 ing 	 	from	a	single	 neuro 	 n 	 	in	the	 hippo 	 campus 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	rat	here	.
and	when	it	 fire 	 s 	 	a	little	spike	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	there	's	going	to	be	a	red	dot	and	a	click	.
so	what	we	see	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 neuro 	 n 	 	 know 	 s 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	the	rat	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	 in 	 to 	 	one	 part 	 icular 	 	place	in	 it 	 s 	 	environment	.
and	it	 signal 	 s 	 	to	the	rest	of	the	brain	by	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	little	 electric 	 al 	 	spike	.
so	we	could	show	the	 fir 	 ing 	 	rate	of	that	 neuro 	 n 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	the	animal	's	location	.
and	if	we	record	from	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	we	'll	see	that	different	 neuro 	 ns 	 	fire	when	the	animal	 go 	 es 	 	in	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	environment	,	like	in	 th 	 is 	 	square	box	 show 	 n 	 	here	.
so	together	they	form	a	map	for	the	rest	of	the	brain	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	brain	 continu 	 ally 	 	,	``	where	am	i	now	 with 	 in 	 	my	environment	?	``
place	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	.
so	epilepsy	 patient 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	need	the	 electric 	 al 	 	activity	in	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 monitor 	 ing 	 	.
and	some	of	these	 patient 	 s 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	a	video	game	where	they	drive	around	a	small	town	.
and	place	 cell 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	hippocampi	would	fire	,	 be 	 come 	 	active	,	start	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 impulse 	 s 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	they	drove	through	a	 part 	 icular 	 	location	in	that	town	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	a	place	cell	know	where	the	rat	or	person	is	 with 	 in 	 	 it 	 s 	 	environment	?
well	these	two	 cell 	 s 	 	here	show	us	that	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	the	environment	are	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
so	the	one	on	the	top	 like 	 s 	 	to	fire	sort	of	 mid 	 way 	 	between	the	 wall 	 s 	 	of	the	box	that	 the 	 ir 	 	rat	's	in	.
and	when	you	expand	the	box	,	the	 fir 	 ing 	 	location	 expand 	 s 	 	.
the	one	 be 	 low 	 	 like 	 s 	 	to	fire	 when 	 ever 	 	there	's	a	wall	close	by	to	the	south	.
and	if	you	put	 an 	 other 	 	wall	 in 	 side 	 	the	box	,	then	the	cell	 fire 	 s 	 	in	both	place	 where 	 ver 	 	there	's	a	wall	to	the	south	 a 	 s 	 	the	animal	 explore 	 s 	 	around	in	 it 	 s 	 	box	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 predict 	 s 	 	that	 sens 	 ing 	 	the	 distance 	 s 	 	and	 direction 	 s 	 	of	 bound 	 aries 	 	around	you	--	 extend 	 ed 	 	 building 	 s 	 	and	so	on	--	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	 hippo 	 campus 	 	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	on	the	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	to	the	 hippo 	 campus 	 	,	 cell 	 s 	 	are	found	which	project	 in 	 to 	 	the	 hippo 	 campus 	 	,	which	do	respond	 exact 	 ly 	 	to	 detect 	 ing 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	or	 edge 	 s 	 	at	 part 	 icular 	 	 distance 	 s 	 	and	 direction 	 s 	 	from	the	rat	or	mouse	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	around	.
so	the	cell	on	the	left	,	you	can	see	,	it	 fire 	 s 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	the	animal	 get 	 s 	 	near	to	a	wall	or	a	 bound 	 ary 	 	to	the	east	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	the	edge	or	the	wall	of	a	square	box	or	the	 circul 	 ar 	 	wall	of	the	 circul 	 ar 	 	box	or	even	the	drop	at	the	edge	of	a	table	,	which	the	 animal 	 s 	 	are	running	around	.
and	the	cell	on	the	right	there	 fire 	 s 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	there	's	a	 bound 	 ary 	 	to	the	south	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	the	drop	at	the	edge	of	the	table	or	a	wall	or	even	the	gap	between	two	 table 	 s 	 	that	are	 pull 	 ed 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
so	that	's	one	way	in	which	we	think	place	 cell 	 s 	 	determine	where	the	animal	is	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	around	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	test	where	we	think	 object 	 s 	 	are	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	goal	flag	,	in	simple	 environment 	 s 	 	--	or	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	where	your	car	would	be	.
so	we	can	have	people	explore	an	environment	and	see	the	location	they	have	to	remember	.
and	then	,	if	we	put	them	back	in	the	environment	,	 general 	 ly 	 	they	're	 quit 	 e 	 	good	at	 put 	 ting 	 	a	marker	down	where	they	thought	that	flag	or	 the 	 ir 	 	car	was	.
but	on	some	 trial 	 s 	 	,	we	could	change	the	shape	and	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	environment	like	we	did	with	the	place	cell	.
in	that	case	,	we	can	see	how	where	they	think	the	flag	had	 be 	 en 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	how	you	change	the	shape	and	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	environment	.
and	what	you	see	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	the	flag	was	where	that	cross	was	in	a	small	square	environment	,	and	then	if	you	ask	people	where	it	was	,	but	you	've	made	the	environment	 big 	 ger 	 	,	where	they	think	the	flag	had	 be 	 en 	 	 stretch 	 es 	 	out	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	that	the	place	cell	 fir 	 ing 	 	 stretch 	 ed 	 	out	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	remember	where	the	flag	was	by	storing	the	pattern	of	 fir 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	all	of	your	place	 cell 	 s 	 	at	that	location	,	and	then	you	can	get	back	to	that	location	by	moving	around	so	that	you	best	match	the	current	pattern	of	 fir 	 ing 	 	of	your	place	 cell 	 s 	 	with	that	 store 	 d 	 	pattern	.
that	 guide 	 s 	 	you	back	to	the	location	that	you	want	to	remember	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	know	where	we	are	through	 move 	 ment 	 	.
so	if	we	take	some	 out 	 bound 	 	path	--	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	park	and	we	wander	off	--	we	know	 be 	 cause 	 	our	own	 move 	 ments 	 	,	which	we	can	integrate	over	 th 	 is 	 	path	 rough 	 ly 	 	what	the	 head 	 ing 	 	direction	is	to	go	back	.
and	place	 cell 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	get	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	path	 integ 	 ration 	 	 in 	 put 	 	from	a	kind	of	cell	 call 	 ed 	 	a	grid	cell	.
now	grid	 cell 	 s 	 	are	found	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	on	the	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	to	the	 hippo 	 campus 	 	,	and	they	're	a	bit	like	place	 cell 	 s 	 	.
but	now	 a 	 s 	 	the	rat	 explore 	 s 	 	around	,	each	individual	cell	 fire 	 s 	 	in	a	whole	array	of	different	 location 	 s 	 	which	are	laid	out	 a 	 cross 	 	the	environment	in	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	regular	 tri 	 angular 	 	grid	.
and	if	you	record	from	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	grid	 cell 	 s 	 	--	 show 	 n 	 	here	in	different	 color 	 s 	 	--	each	one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	grid	-	like	 fir 	 ing 	 	pattern	 a 	 cross 	 	the	environment	,	and	each	cell	's	grid	-	like	 fir 	 ing 	 	pattern	is	 shift 	 ed 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	the	other	 cell 	 s 	 	.
so	the	red	one	 fire 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	grid	and	the	green	one	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	and	the	blue	on	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
so	together	,	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	rat	can	put	a	virtual	grid	of	 fir 	 ing 	 	 location 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 it 	 s 	 	environment	--	a	bit	like	the	latitude	and	 long 	 itude 	 	lines	that	you	'd	find	on	a	map	,	but	using	 triangle 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 move 	 s 	 	around	,	the	 electric 	 al 	 	activity	can	pass	from	one	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	to	the	next	cell	to	keep	track	of	where	it	is	,	so	that	it	can	use	 it 	 s 	 	own	 move 	 ments 	 	to	know	where	it	is	in	 it 	 s 	 	environment	.
do	people	have	grid	 cell 	 s 	 	?
well	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	the	grid	-	like	 fir 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	have	the	same	 axe 	 s 	 	of	symmetry	,	the	same	 orient 	 ations 	 	of	grid	,	 show 	 n 	 	in	 o 	 range 	 	here	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	net	activity	of	all	of	the	grid	 cell 	 s 	 	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	part	of	the	brain	should	change	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	running	 a 	 long 	 	these	six	 direction 	 s 	 	or	running	 a 	 long 	 	one	of	the	six	 direction 	 s 	 	in	between	.
so	we	can	put	people	in	an	mri	scanner	and	have	them	do	a	little	video	game	like	the	one	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	and	look	for	 th 	 is 	 	signal	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	you	do	see	it	in	the	human	entorhinal	cortex	,	which	is	the	same	part	of	the	brain	that	you	see	grid	 cell 	 s 	 	in	 rat 	 s 	 	.
so	back	to	homer	.
he	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 remember 	 ing 	 	where	his	car	was	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 distance 	 s 	 	and	 direction 	 s 	 	to	 extend 	 ed 	 	 building 	 s 	 	and	 bound 	 aries 	 	around	the	location	where	he	 park 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	would	be	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	the	 fir 	 ing 	 	of	 bound 	 ary 	 	-	 detect 	 ing 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
he	's	 al 	 so 	 	 remember 	 ing 	 	the	path	he	took	out	of	the	car	park	,	which	would	be	 represent 	 ed 	 	in	the	 fir 	 ing 	 	of	grid	 cell 	 s 	 	.
now	both	of	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	can	make	the	place	 cell 	 s 	 	fire	.
and	he	can	return	to	the	location	where	he	 park 	 ed 	 	by	moving	so	 a 	 s 	 	to	find	where	it	is	that	best	 match 	 es 	 	the	 fir 	 ing 	 	pattern	of	the	place	 cell 	 s 	 	in	his	brain	 current 	 ly 	 	with	the	 store 	 d 	 	pattern	where	he	 park 	 ed 	 	his	car	.
and	that	 guide 	 s 	 	him	back	to	that	location	 ir 	 respect 	 ive 	 	of	visual	 cue 	 s 	 	like	 whet 	 her 	 	his	car	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 tow 	 ed 	 	.
but	he	 know 	 s 	 	where	it	was	,	so	he	 know 	 s 	 	to	go	and	get	it	.
so	beyond	spatial	 memor 	 y 	 	,	if	we	look	for	 th 	 is 	 	grid	-	like	 fir 	 ing 	 	pattern	 through 	 out 	 	the	whole	brain	,	we	see	it	in	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 location 	 s 	 	which	are	 al 	 ways 	 	active	when	we	do	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	 task 	 s 	 	,	like	 remember 	 ing 	 	the	last	time	you	went	to	a	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
so	it	may	be	that	the	neural	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	for	 represent 	 ing 	 	the	space	around	us	are	 al 	 so 	 	used	for	generating	visual	 image 	 ry 	 	so	that	we	can	 re 	 create 	 	the	spatial	scene	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	of	the	 event 	 s 	 	that	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	us	when	we	want	to	imagine	them	.
so	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	your	 memor 	 ies 	 	could	start	by	place	 cell 	 s 	 	 activ 	 ating 	 	each	other	via	these	dense	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	and	then	reactivating	 bound 	 ary 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	to	create	the	spatial	structure	of	the	scene	around	your	 view 	 point 	 	.
and	grid	 cell 	 s 	 	could	move	 th 	 is 	 	 view 	 point 	 	through	that	space	.
 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	cell	,	head	direction	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	i	did	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	yet	,	they	fire	like	a	compass	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	which	way	you	're	facing	.
they	could	define	the	 view 	 ing 	 	direction	from	which	you	want	to	generate	an	image	for	your	visual	 image 	 ry 	 	,	so	you	can	imagine	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	new	era	 re 	 ally 	 	in	cognitive	 neuro 	 science 	 	where	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	understand	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 process 	 es 	 	like	how	you	remember	or	imagine	or	even	think	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 action 	 s 	 	of	the	 billion 	 s 	 	of	individual	 neuro 	 ns 	 	that	make	up	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
