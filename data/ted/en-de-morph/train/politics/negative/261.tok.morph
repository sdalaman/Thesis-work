how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	alfred	hitchcock	film	``	the	 bird 	 s 	 	``	?
any	of	you	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 freak 	 ed 	 	out	by	that	?
you	might	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	now	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 vend 	 ing 	 	machine	for	 crow 	 s 	 	.
and	over	the	past	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	,	``	how	did	you	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	?	how	did	you	get	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	it	 start 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	great	 idea 	 s 	 	,	or	 man 	 y 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	get	rid	of	 any 	 way 	 	,	at	a	 cock 	 tail 	 	party	.
about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	at	a	 cock 	 tail 	 	party	with	a	friend	of	mine	,	and	we	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	,	and	he	was	 complain 	 ing 	 	about	the	 crow 	 s 	 	that	he	had	 s 	 een 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	all	over	his	yard	and	making	a	big	mess	.
and	he	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	 re 	 ally 	 	,	we	ought	to	try	and	 eradic 	 ate 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	got	ta	kill	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	making	a	mess	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	was	stupid	,	you	know	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	just	train	them	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	was	 im 	 possible 	 	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	i	'm	in	good	company	in	 find 	 ing 	 	that	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 annoy 	 ing 	 	--	when	 some 	 one 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	.
so	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	about	 crow 	 s 	 	in	my	spare	time	.
and	after	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	my	wife	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	you	know	,	you	got	ta	do	 th 	 is 	 	thing	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	and	build	the	 vend 	 ing 	 	machine	.	``
so	i	did	.
but	part	of	the	reason	that	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	that	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	aware	of	all	the	species	that	are	going	extinct	on	the	planet	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	human	 habit 	 ation 	 	expansion	,	and	no	one	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	all	the	species	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	living	--	that	are	 surviv 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	about	synanthropic	species	,	which	are	species	that	have	 adapt 	 ed 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	for	human	 eco 	 logies 	 	,	species	like	 rat 	 s 	 	and	 cock 	 roach 	 es 	 	and	 crow 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	them	,	i	was	 find 	 ing 	 	that	they	had	hyper	-	 adapt 	 ed 	 	.
they	'd	 be 	 come 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 ade 	 pt 	 	at	living	with	us	.
and	in	return	,	we	just	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	kill	them	all	the	time	.
and	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 breed 	 ing 	 	them	for	parasitism	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	giving	them	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	to	adapt	new	ways	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 rat 	 s 	 	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 respons 	 ive 	 	 breed 	 ers 	 	.
and	 cock 	 roach 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	rid	of	them	 know 	 s 	 	,	have	 be 	 come 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	to	the	 poison 	 s 	 	that	we	're	using	.
so	,	i	thought	,	let	's	build	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 mutual 	 ly 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	.
well	,	then	let	's	build	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	both	benefit	from	,	and	find	some	way	to	make	a	new	relationship	with	these	species	.
and	so	i	built	the	 vend 	 ing 	 	machine	.
but	the	story	of	the	 vend 	 ing 	 	machine	is	a	little	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	if	you	know	more	about	 crow 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 crow 	 s 	 	are	n't	just	 surviv 	 ing 	 	with	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 thriv 	 ing 	 	.
they	're	found	 every 	 where 	 	on	the	planet	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	and	the	southern	tip	of	south	america	.
and	in	all	that	area	,	they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	found	 breed 	 ing 	 	more	than	five	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	from	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
so	we	may	not	think	about	them	,	but	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	around	.
and	not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	the	human	population	growth	,	more	than	half	of	the	human	population	is	living	in	cities	now	.
and	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	nine	-	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	the	human	growth	population	is	 occur 	 ring 	 	in	cities	.
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	a	population	boom	with	 crow 	 s 	 	.
so	bird	 count 	 s 	 	are	 indic 	 ating 	 	that	we	might	be	 see 	 ing 	 	up	to	exponential	growth	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	no	great	surprise	.
but	what	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	was	to	find	out	that	the	 bird 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 adapt 	 ing 	 	in	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	way	.
and	i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	betty	.	she	's	a	new	caledonian	crow	.
and	these	 crow 	 s 	 	use	 stick 	 s 	 	in	the	wild	to	get	 insect 	 s 	 	and	 what 	 not 	 	out	of	 piece 	 s 	 	of	wood	.
here	,	she	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	piece	of	meat	out	of	a	tube	.
but	the	 research 	 ers 	 	had	a	problem	.
they	 mess 	 ed 	 	up	and	left	just	a	stick	of	wire	in	there	.
and	she	had	n't	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	before	.
you	see	,	it	was	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
so	she	 adapt 	 ed 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	unprompted	.	she	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 one 	 	before	.
no	one	taught	her	to	bend	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	hook	,	had	 show 	 n 	 	her	how	it	could	happen	.
but	she	did	it	all	on	her	own	.
so	keep	in	mind	that	she	's	never	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
right	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.	all	right	.
that	's	the	part	where	the	 research 	 ers 	 	freak	out	.
so	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	that	 crow 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	intelligent	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	are	 proportion 	 ate 	 	,	in	the	same	proportion	 a 	 s 	 	chimpanzee	 brain 	 s 	 	are	.
there	are	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 anecdote 	 s 	 	for	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	they	have	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	sweden	,	 crow 	 s 	 	will	wait	for	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	to	drop	lines	through	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	ice	.
and	when	the	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	move	off	,	the	 crow 	 s 	 	fly	down	,	reel	up	the	lines	,	and	eat	the	fish	or	the	bait	.
it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 annoy 	 ing 	 	for	the	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	.
on	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	tack	,	at	university	of	washington	,	they	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	an	experiment	where	they	 capture 	 d 	 	some	 crow 	 s 	 	on	campus	.
some	 student 	 s 	 	went	out	and	 nett 	 ed 	 	some	 crow 	 s 	 	,	 br 	 ought 	 	them	in	,	and	 we 	 re 	 	--	 weigh 	 ed 	 	them	,	and	 measur 	 ed 	 	them	and	 what 	 not 	 	,	and	then	let	them	back	out	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	 we 	 re 	 	 entertain 	 ed 	 	to	discover	that	for	the	rest	of	the	week	,	these	 crow 	 s 	 	,	 when 	 ever 	 	these	 part 	 icular 	 	 student 	 s 	 	 walk 	 ed 	 	around	campus	,	these	 crow 	 s 	 	would	caw	at	them	,	and	run	around	and	make	 the 	 ir 	 	life	kind	of	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	less	 entertain 	 ed 	 	when	 th 	 is 	 	went	on	for	the	next	week	.
and	the	next	month	.	and	after	summer	break	.
 un 	 til 	 	they	 final 	 ly 	 	 graduate 	 d 	 	and	left	campus	,	and	--	glad	to	get	away	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	--	came	back	 some 	 time 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	found	the	 crow 	 s 	 	still	 remember 	 ed 	 	them	.
so	--	the	moral	 be 	 ing 	 	,	do	n't	piss	off	 crow 	 s 	 	.
so	now	,	 student 	 s 	 	at	the	university	of	washington	that	are	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	these	 crow 	 s 	 	do	so	with	a	giant	wig	and	a	big	mask	.
it	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	know	that	these	 crow 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	,	but	the	more	i	 d 	 ug 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	more	i	found	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	an	even	more	significant	 adapt 	 ation 	 	.
video	:	 crow 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 skill 	 ed 	 	at	making	a	living	in	these	new	urban	 environment 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	japanese	city	,	they	have	 de 	 vis 	 ed 	 	a	way	of	eating	a	food	that	 normal 	 ly 	 	they	ca	n't	manage	:	drop	it	among	the	traffic	.
the	problem	now	is	 collect 	 ing 	 	the	bits	,	 with 	 out 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	run	over	.
wait	for	the	light	to	stop	the	traffic	.
then	,	collect	your	 crack 	 ed 	 	nut	in	 safe 	 ty 	 	.
joshua	klein	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	's	significant	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	that	 crow 	 s 	 	are	using	 car 	 s 	 	to	crack	nuts	.
in	fact	,	that	's	old	hat	for	 crow 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	sendai	city	,	at	a	 driv 	 ing 	 	school	in	the	 suburb 	 s 	 	of	tokyo	.
and	since	that	time	,	all	of	the	 crow 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	are	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	.
and	now	,	every	crow	 with 	 in 	 	five	 kilometer 	 s 	 	is	 stand 	 ing 	 	by	a	 side 	 walk 	 	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	collect	 it 	 s 	 	lunch	.
so	,	they	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	each	other	.	and	research	 bear 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	out	.
 parent 	 s 	 	seem	to	be	 teach 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	young	.
they	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 peer 	 s 	 	.	they	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 ene 	 mies 	 	.
if	i	have	a	little	extra	time	,	i	'll	tell	you	about	a	case	of	crow	infidelity	that	 illustr 	 ates 	 	that	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
the	point	 be 	 ing 	 	that	they	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	cultural	 adapt 	 ation 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	 yester 	 day 	 	,	that	's	the	pandora	's	box	that	's	 get 	 ting 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	trouble	,	and	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	it	with	them	.
they	're	able	to	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	flexibly	adapt	to	new	 challeng 	 es 	 	and	new	 resource 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	if	you	live	in	a	city	.
so	we	know	that	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 crow 	 s 	 	.
we	found	out	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	,	and	we	found	out	that	they	can	teach	each	other	.
and	when	all	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	clear	to	me	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	obvious	thing	to	do	is	build	a	 vend 	 ing 	 	machine	.
so	that	's	what	we	did	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 vend 	 ing 	 	machine	for	 crow 	 s 	 	.
and	it	uses	skinnerian	training	to	shape	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	over	four	 stage 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	we	put	 th 	 is 	 	out	in	a	field	,	or	 some 	 place 	 	where	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 crow 	 s 	 	,	and	we	put	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	and	 peanut 	 s 	 	all	around	the	base	of	the	machine	.
and	 crow 	 s 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	come	by	,	and	eat	the	 peanut 	 s 	 	and	get	used	to	the	machine	 be 	 ing 	 	there	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	they	eat	up	all	the	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
and	then	they	see	that	there	are	 peanut 	 s 	 	here	on	the	 feed 	 er 	 	tray	,	and	they	hop	up	and	help	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	then	they	 leav 	 e 	 	,	and	the	machine	 s 	 pit 	 s 	 	up	more	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	and	 peanut 	 s 	 	,	and	life	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 dan 	 dy 	 	,	if	you	're	a	crow	.
then	you	can	come	back	 any 	 time 	 	and	get	 your 	 self 	 	a	peanut	.
so	,	when	they	get	 re 	 ally 	 	used	to	that	,	we	move	on	to	the	 crow 	 s 	 	coming	back	.
now	,	they	're	used	to	the	sound	of	the	machine	,	and	they	keep	coming	back	,	and	 dig 	 ging 	 	out	these	 peanut 	 s 	 	from	 among 	 st 	 	the	pile	of	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	that	's	there	.
and	when	they	get	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	stymie	them	.
and	we	move	to	the	third	stage	,	where	we	 on 	 ly 	 	give	them	a	 co 	 in 	 	.
now	,	like	most	of	us	who	have	gotten	used	to	a	good	thing	,	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	pisses	them	off	.
so	,	they	do	what	they	do	in	nature	when	they	're	looking	for	 some 	 thing 	 	--	they	 s 	 weep 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	out	of	the	way	with	 the 	 ir 	 	beak	.
and	they	do	that	here	,	and	that	 knock 	 s 	 	the	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	down	the	 s 	 lot 	 	,	and	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	they	get	a	peanut	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	on	for	some	time	.
the	 crow 	 s 	 	learn	that	all	they	have	to	do	is	show	up	,	wait	for	the	 co 	 in 	 	to	come	out	,	put	the	 co 	 in 	 	in	the	 s 	 lot 	 	,	and	then	they	get	 the 	 ir 	 	peanut	.
and	when	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	good	and	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	that	,	we	move	to	the	final	stage	,	in	which	they	show	up	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	see	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 crow 	 s 	 	and	other	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 squirrel 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	would	show	up	,	look	for	the	peanut	,	go	away	.
come	back	,	look	for	the	peanut	,	go	away	.
they	do	 th 	 is 	 	 may 	 be 	 	half	a	dozen	 time 	 s 	 	before	they	get	 bor 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	they	go	off	and	play	in	traffic	.
 crow 	 s 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	show	up	,	and	they	try	and	figure	it	out	.
they	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	machine	's	 be 	 en 	 	 mess 	 ing 	 	with	them	,	through	three	different	 stage 	 s 	 	of	behavior	.
they	figure	it	's	got	ta	have	more	to	it	.
so	,	they	poke	at	it	and	peck	at	it	and	 what 	 not 	 	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	some	crow	 get 	 s 	 	a	bright	idea	that	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	 ly 	 ing 	 	around	from	the	first	stage	,	 ly 	 ing 	 	around	on	the	ground	,	``	 hop 	 s 	 	down	,	 pick 	 s 	 	it	up	,	 drop 	 s 	 	it	in	the	 s 	 lot 	 	.
and	then	,	we	're	off	to	the	 race 	 s 	 	.
that	crow	 enjoy 	 s 	 	a	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 monopol 	 y 	 	on	 peanut 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	his	 friend 	 s 	 	figure	out	how	to	do	it	,	and	then	there	we	go	.
so	,	what	's	significant	about	 th 	 is 	 	to	me	is	n't	that	we	can	train	 crow 	 s 	 	to	pick	up	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
mind	you	,	there	's	216	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	change	lost	every	year	,	but	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	i	can	depend	on	that	roi	from	 crow 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	think	we	should	look	a	little	bit	 large 	 r 	 	.
i	think	that	 crow 	 s 	 	can	be	trained	to	do	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	why	not	train	them	to	pick	up	garbage	after	 stad 	 ium 	 	 event 	 s 	 	?
or	find	expensive	 component 	 s 	 	from	 dis 	 card 	 ed 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	?
or	 may 	 be 	 	do	search	and	 rescu 	 e 	 	?
the	main	thing	,	the	main	point	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	for	me	is	that	we	can	find	 mutual 	 ly 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	for	these	species	.
we	can	find	ways	to	interact	with	these	other	species	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	involve	exterminating	them	,	but	 involve 	 s 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	an	equilibrium	with	them	that	's	a	 use 	 ful 	 	balance	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
