i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	a	lot	with	motion	and	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	i	'm	an	old	dj	and	a	 music 	 ian 	 	.
so	,	music	 video 	 s 	 	are	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	 al 	 ways 	 	found	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	they	 al 	 ways 	 	seem	to	be	so	 re 	 active 	 	.
so	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	can	you	 re 	 move 	 	us	 a 	 s 	 	 creator 	 s 	 	and	try	to	make	the	music	be	the	voice	and	have	the	 anim 	 ation 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	it	?
so	with	two	 design 	 ers 	 	,	tolga	and	christina	,	at	my	 off 	 ice 	 	,	we	took	a	track	--	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	it	.	it	's	about	25	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	it	's	david	byrne	and	brian	eno	--	and	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	little	 anim 	 ation 	 	.
