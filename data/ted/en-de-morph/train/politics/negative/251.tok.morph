in	the	year	1919	,	a	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 un 	 known 	 	german	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	,	named	theodor	kaluza	 suggest 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bold	and	,	in	some	ways	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bizarre	idea	.
he	 pro 	 posed 	 	that	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	more	than	the	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	that	we	are	all	aware	of	.
that	is	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	left	,	right	,	back	,	forth	and	up	,	down	,	kaluza	 pro 	 posed 	 	that	there	might	be	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	space	that	for	some	reason	we	do	n't	yet	see	.
now	,	when	 some 	 one 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	bold	and	bizarre	idea	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	that	's	all	it	is	--	bold	and	bizarre	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	the	world	around	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	idea	,	 how 	 ever 	 	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	do	n't	yet	know	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	right	or	wrong	,	and	at	the	end	i	'll	discuss	 experiment 	 s 	 	which	,	in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	may	tell	us	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	right	or	wrong	--	 th 	 is 	 	idea	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	major	impact	on	physics	in	the	last	century	and	 continu 	 es 	 	to	inform	a	lot	of	cutting	-	edge	research	.
so	,	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	story	of	these	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
so	where	do	we	go	?
to	begin	we	need	a	little	bit	of	back	story	.	go	to	1907	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	year	when	einstein	is	 bask 	 ing 	 	in	the	glow	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	special	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	and	 decide 	 s 	 	to	take	on	a	new	project	,	to	try	to	understand	fully	the	grand	,	pervasive	force	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
and	in	that	moment	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	people	around	who	thought	that	that	project	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	resolved	.
newton	had	 give 	 n 	 	the	world	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	in	the	late	1600s	that	 work 	 s 	 	well	,	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	the	motion	of	 planet 	 s 	 	,	the	motion	of	the	moon	and	so	forth	,	the	motion	of	 a 	 po 	 cry 	 phal 	 	of	 apple 	 s 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	from	 tree 	 s 	 	,	hitting	people	on	the	head	.
all	of	that	could	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	using	newton	's	work	.
but	einstein	 real 	 ized 	 	that	newton	had	left	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	the	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	even	newton	had	written	that	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	he	 under 	 stood 	 	how	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	effect	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	he	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 un 	 able 	 	to	figure	out	how	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
how	is	it	that	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	93	million	 mile 	 s 	 	away	,	[	that	]	 some 	 how 	 	it	 affect 	 s 	 	the	motion	of	the	earth	?
how	 do 	 es 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	reach	out	 a 	 cross 	 	empty	 in 	 ert 	 	space	and	exert	influence	?
and	that	is	a	task	to	which	einstein	set	 him 	 self 	 	--	to	figure	out	how	 gravit 	 y 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	let	me	show	you	what	it	is	that	he	found	.
so	einstein	found	that	the	medium	that	 transmit 	 s 	 	 gravit 	 y 	 	is	space	 it 	 self 	 	.
the	idea	 go 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	imagine	space	is	a	substrate	of	all	there	is	.
einstein	 s 	 aid 	 	space	is	nice	and	flat	,	if	there	's	no	matter	present	.
but	if	there	is	matter	in	the	environment	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	it	 cause 	 s 	 	the	fabric	of	space	to	warp	,	to	 curv 	 e 	 	.
and	that	 communicate 	 s 	 	the	force	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
even	the	earth	 warp 	 s 	 	space	around	it	.
now	look	at	the	moon	.
the	moon	is	 ke 	 pt 	 	in	orbit	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	these	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 roll 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	a	 val 	 ley 	 	in	the	 curv 	 ed 	 	environment	that	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	the	moon	and	the	earth	can	all	create	by	virtue	of	 the 	 ir 	 	presence	.
we	go	to	a	full	-	frame	view	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	earth	 it 	 self 	 	is	 ke 	 pt 	 	in	orbit	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 roll 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	a	 val 	 ley 	 	in	the	environment	that	's	 curv 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	presence	.
that	is	 th 	 is 	 	new	idea	about	how	 gravit 	 y 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	was	tested	in	1919	through	astronomical	 observ 	 ations 	 	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.	it	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	the	data	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 gain 	 ed 	 	einstein	prominence	around	the	world	.
and	that	is	what	got	kaluza	 think 	 ing 	 	.
he	,	like	einstein	,	was	in	search	of	what	we	call	a	 un 	 ified 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
that	's	one	 theor 	 y 	 	that	might	be	able	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	all	of	nature	's	 force 	 s 	 	from	one	set	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	one	set	of	 principle 	 s 	 	,	one	master	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	if	you	will	.
so	kaluza	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 him 	 self 	 	,	einstein	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 gravit 	 y 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 warp 	 s 	 	and	 curv 	 es 	 	in	space	--	in	fact	,	space	and	time	,	to	be	more	precise	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	can	play	the	same	game	with	the	other	known	force	,	which	was	,	at	that	time	,	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	force	--	we	know	of	 other 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	at	that	time	that	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	other	one	people	 we 	 re 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
you	know	,	the	force	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 electric 	 ity 	 	and	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 attract 	 ion 	 	and	so	forth	.
so	kaluza	 say 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	can	play	the	same	game	and	 de 	 scribe 	 	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	force	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 warp 	 s 	 	and	 curv 	 es 	 	.
that	raised	a	question	:	 warp 	 s 	 	and	 curv 	 es 	 	in	what	?
einstein	had	 al 	 ready 	 	used	up	space	and	time	,	 warp 	 s 	 	and	 curv 	 es 	 	,	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
there	did	n't	seem	to	be	 any 	 thing 	 	else	to	warp	or	 curv 	 e 	 	.
so	kaluza	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	there	are	more	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	space	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	i	want	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	one	more	force	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	need	one	more	dimension	.
so	he	 imagin 	 ed 	 	that	the	world	had	four	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	space	,	not	three	,	and	 imagin 	 ed 	 	that	 electro 	 magnet 	 ism 	 	was	 warp 	 s 	 	and	 curv 	 es 	 	in	that	fourth	dimension	.	now	here	's	the	thing	:	when	he	wrote	down	the	 equ 	 ations 	 	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	 warp 	 s 	 	and	 curv 	 es 	 	in	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	with	four	space	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	not	three	,	he	found	the	old	 equ 	 ations 	 	that	einstein	had	 al 	 ready 	 	derived	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	for	 gravit 	 y 	 	--	but	he	found	one	more	 equ 	 ation 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	one	more	dimension	.
and	when	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	that	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	it	was	 non 	 e 	 	other	than	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	had	long	known	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	force	.
 amaz 	 ing 	 	--	it	just	 pop 	 ped 	 	out	.
he	was	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 real 	 ization 	 	that	he	ran	around	his	house	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	,	``	 vict 	 ory 	 	!	``	--	that	he	had	found	the	 un 	 ified 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
now	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	kaluza	was	a	man	who	took	 theor 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
he	,	in	fact	--	there	is	a	story	that	when	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	learn	how	to	swim	,	he	read	a	book	,	a	 treat 	 ise 	 	on	 swimm 	 ing 	 	--	--	then	dove	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	man	who	would	risk	his	life	on	 theor 	 y 	 	.
now	,	but	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	a	little	bit	more	 practical 	 ly 	 	minded	,	two	 question 	 s 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	arise	from	his	 observ 	 ation 	 	.
number	one	:	if	there	are	more	 dimension 	 s 	 	in	space	,	where	are	they	?
we	do	n't	seem	to	see	them	.
and	number	two	:	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	work	in	detail	,	when	you	try	to	 app 	 ly 	 	it	to	the	world	around	us	?
now	,	the	first	question	was	 answer 	 ed 	 	in	1926	by	a	fellow	named	oskar	klein	.
he	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	 dimension 	 s 	 	might	come	in	two	 varie 	 ties 	 	--	there	might	be	big	,	easy	-	to	-	see	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	but	there	might	 al 	 so 	 	be	 tin 	 y 	 	,	curled	-	up	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	curled	up	so	small	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	all	around	us	,	that	we	do	n't	see	them	.
let	me	show	you	that	one	 visual 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	imagine	you	're	looking	at	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	cable	 support 	 ing 	 	a	traffic	light	.
it	's	in	manhattan	.	you	're	in	central	park	--	it	's	kind	of	 ir 	 relevant 	 	--	but	the	cable	 look 	 s 	 	one	-	dimensional	from	a	 di 	 stant 	 	 view 	 point 	 	,	but	you	and	i	all	know	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	have	some	 thick 	 ness 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	see	it	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	from	far	away	.
but	if	we	zoom	in	and	take	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	,	say	,	a	little	ant	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	--	little	ants	are	so	small	that	they	can	access	all	of	the	 dimension 	 s 	 	--	the	long	dimension	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 clock 	 wise 	 	,	counter	-	 clock 	 wise 	 	direction	.
and	i	hope	you	appreciate	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	took	so	long	to	get	these	ants	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 illustr 	 ates 	 	the	fact	that	 dimension 	 s 	 	can	be	of	two	 sort 	 s 	 	:	big	and	small	.	and	the	idea	that	 may 	 be 	 	the	big	 dimension 	 s 	 	around	us	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	see	,	but	there	might	be	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	curled	up	,	sort	of	like	the	 circul 	 ar 	 	part	of	that	cable	,	so	small	that	they	have	so	far	 remain 	 ed 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	.
let	me	show	you	what	that	would	look	like	.
so	,	if	we	take	a	look	,	say	,	at	space	 it 	 self 	 	--	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	show	,	of	course	,	two	 dimension 	 s 	 	on	a	screen	.
some	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	will	fix	that	one	day	,	but	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	not	flat	on	a	screen	is	a	new	dimension	,	 go 	 es 	 	 small 	 er 	 	,	 small 	 er 	 	,	 small 	 er 	 	,	and	way	down	in	the	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 depth 	 s 	 	of	space	 it 	 self 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	idea	,	you	could	have	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	curled	up	 dimension 	 s 	 	--	here	is	a	little	shape	of	a	circle	--	so	small	that	we	do	n't	see	them	.
but	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	little	ultra	 micro 	 scopic 	 	ant	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	,	you	could	walk	in	the	big	 dimension 	 s 	 	that	we	all	know	about	--	that	's	like	the	grid	part	--	but	you	could	 al 	 so 	 	access	the	 tin 	 y 	 	curled	-	up	dimension	that	's	so	small	that	we	ca	n't	see	it	with	the	naked	eye	or	even	with	any	of	our	most	 refine 	 d 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
but	 deep 	 ly 	 	 tuck 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	fabric	of	space	 it 	 self 	 	,	the	idea	is	there	could	be	more	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	there	.
now	that	's	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	about	how	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	could	have	more	 dimension 	 s 	 	than	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	see	.
but	what	about	the	second	question	that	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	:	 do 	 es 	 	the	 theor 	 y 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	when	you	try	to	 app 	 ly 	 	it	to	the	real	world	?
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	einstein	and	kaluza	and	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 try 	 ing 	 	to	refine	 th 	 is 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	and	 app 	 ly 	 	it	to	the	physics	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 a 	 s 	 	was	 under 	 stood 	 	at	the	time	,	and	,	in	detail	,	it	did	n't	work	.
in	detail	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	they	could	n't	get	the	mass	of	the	electron	to	work	out	 correct 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	people	 work 	 ed 	 	on	it	,	but	by	the	'40s	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	by	the	'50s	,	 th 	 is 	 	strange	but	 ver 	 y 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	idea	of	how	to	 un 	 ify 	 	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	had	gone	away	.
 un 	 til 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	our	age	.
in	our	era	,	a	new	approach	to	 un 	 ify 	 	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 pursue 	 d 	 	by	 physicist 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	superstring	 theor 	 y 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	 indic 	 ating 	 	.
and	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	is	that	superstring	 theor 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	at	first	sight	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	but	when	we	 stud 	 y 	 	superstring	 theor 	 y 	 	,	we	find	that	it	 resurrect 	 s 	 	the	idea	in	a	 spark 	 ling 	 	,	new	form	.
so	,	let	me	just	tell	you	how	that	 go 	 es 	 	.
superstring	 theor 	 y 	 	--	what	is	it	?
well	,	it	's	a	 theor 	 y 	 	that	tries	to	answer	the	question	:	what	are	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	fundamental	,	 indi 	 visible 	 	,	uncuttable	 constit 	 uent 	 s 	 	making	up	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	world	around	us	?
the	idea	is	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	imagine	we	look	at	a	familiar	object	,	just	a	candle	in	a	holder	,	and	imagine	that	we	want	to	figure	out	what	it	is	made	of	.
so	we	go	on	a	journey	deep	 in 	 side 	 	the	object	and	examine	the	 constit 	 uent 	 s 	 	.
so	deep	 in 	 side 	 	--	we	all	know	,	you	go	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	far	down	,	you	have	 atom 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	all	know	that	 atom 	 s 	 	are	not	the	end	of	the	story	.
they	have	little	 electron 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 warm 	 	around	a	central	nucleus	with	 neutron 	 s 	 	and	 proton 	 s 	 	.
even	the	 neutron 	 s 	 	and	 proton 	 s 	 	have	 small 	 er 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	them	known	 a 	 s 	 	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	.
that	is	where	 convention 	 al 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	stop	.
here	is	the	new	idea	of	string	 theor 	 y 	 	.
deep	 in 	 side 	 	any	of	these	 particle 	 s 	 	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
 th 	 is 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	is	 th 	 is 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	 fi 	 lament 	 	of	energy	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 vib 	 rating 	 	string	--	that	's	where	the	idea	,	string	 theor 	 y 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
and	just	like	the	 vib 	 rating 	 	 string 	 s 	 	that	you	just	saw	in	a	cello	can	 vib 	 rate 	 	in	different	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	these	can	 al 	 so 	 	 vib 	 rate 	 	in	different	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
they	do	n't	produce	different	musical	 note 	 s 	 	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	they	produce	the	different	 particle 	 s 	 	making	up	the	world	around	us	.
so	if	these	 idea 	 s 	 	are	correct	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	ultra	-	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
it	's	built	up	of	a	huge	number	of	these	little	 tin 	 y 	 	 fi 	 lament 	 s 	 	of	 vib 	 rating 	 	energy	,	 vib 	 rating 	 	in	different	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	.
the	different	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	produce	the	different	 particle 	 s 	 	.
the	different	 particle 	 s 	 	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	all	the	 rich 	 ness 	 	in	the	world	around	us	.
and	there	you	see	 un 	 ification 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	matter	 particle 	 s 	 	,	 electron 	 s 	 	and	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	,	 radi 	 ation 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	,	 photo 	 ns 	 	,	gravitons	,	are	all	built	up	from	one	 ent 	 ity 	 	.
so	matter	and	the	 force 	 s 	 	of	nature	all	are	put	together	under	the	rubric	of	 vib 	 rating 	 	 string 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	mean	by	a	 un 	 ified 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
now	here	is	the	catch	.
when	you	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	of	string	 theor 	 y 	 	,	you	find	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	in	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	just	 ha 	 s 	 	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	space	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	in	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	with	four	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	space	,	nor	five	,	nor	six	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	and	show	that	it	 work 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	10	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	space	and	one	dimension	of	time	.
it	 lead 	 s 	 	us	right	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	kaluza	and	klein	--	that	our	world	,	when	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	more	 dimension 	 s 	 	than	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	see	.
now	you	might	think	about	that	and	say	,	well	,	ok	,	you	know	,	if	you	have	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	curled	up	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	wo	n't	see	them	,	if	they	're	small	 en 	 ough 	 	.
but	if	there	's	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	of	green	people	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	down	there	,	and	you	make	them	small	 en 	 ough 	 	,	and	we	wo	n't	see	them	either	.	that	is	true	.
one	of	the	other	 predict 	 ions 	 	of	string	 theor 	 y 	 	--	no	,	that	's	not	one	of	the	other	 predict 	 ions 	 	of	string	 theor 	 y 	 	.
but	it	 raise 	 s 	 	the	question	:	are	we	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	hide	away	these	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	or	do	they	tell	us	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	world	?
in	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	time	,	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	two	 feature 	 s 	 	of	them	.
first	is	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	 believ 	 e 	 	that	these	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	hold	the	answer	to	what	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	is	the	 deep 	 est 	 	question	in	 theoretic 	 al 	 	physics	,	 theoretic 	 al 	 	science	.
and	that	question	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	when	we	look	around	the	world	,	 a 	 s 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	for	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	appear	to	be	about	20	 number 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
these	are	 number 	 s 	 	like	the	mass	of	the	 particle 	 s 	 	,	like	 electron 	 s 	 	and	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	,	the	strength	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	the	strength	of	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	force	--	a	list	of	about	20	 number 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	with	 in 	 credible 	 	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	for	why	the	 number 	 s 	 	have	the	 part 	 icular 	 	 value 	 s 	 	that	they	do	.
now	,	 do 	 es 	 	string	 theor 	 y 	 	 off 	 er 	 	an	answer	?
not	yet	.
but	we	 believ 	 e 	 	the	answer	for	why	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	have	the	 value 	 s 	 	they	do	may	 re 	 ly 	 	on	the	form	of	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	is	,	if	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	had	any	other	 value 	 s 	 	than	the	known	 one 	 s 	 	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	,	would	n't	exist	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	deep	question	.
why	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	so	 fine 	 ly 	 	tuned	to	allow	 star 	 s 	 	to	shine	and	 planet 	 s 	 	to	form	,	when	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	if	you	 fiddl 	 e 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	--	if	i	had	20	 dial 	 s 	 	up	here	and	i	let	you	come	up	and	 fiddl 	 e 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	any	 fiddl 	 ing 	 	 make 	 s 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	disappear	.
so	can	we	explain	 t 	 hose 	 	20	 number 	 s 	 	?
and	string	 theor 	 y 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	20	 number 	 s 	 	have	to	do	with	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
let	me	show	you	how	.
so	when	we	talk	about	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	in	string	 theor 	 y 	 	,	it	's	not	one	extra	dimension	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	 old 	 er 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	kaluza	and	klein	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	string	 theor 	 y 	 	 say 	 s 	 	about	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
they	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	,	 intertwine 	 d 	 	 geo 	 metry 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	calabi	-	yau	shape	--	name	is	n't	all	that	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	fold	in	on	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	intertwine	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	shape	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	structure	.
and	the	idea	is	that	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	look	like	,	then	the	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	all	around	us	would	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	 tin 	 iest 	 	of	 scale 	 s 	 	.
when	you	 s 	 wing 	 	your	hand	,	you	'd	be	moving	around	these	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	but	they	're	so	small	that	we	would	n't	know	it	.
so	what	is	the	physical	 implic 	 ation 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	relevant	to	 t 	 hose 	 	20	 number 	 s 	 	?
consider	 th 	 is 	 	.	if	you	look	at	the	instrument	,	a	french	horn	,	notice	that	the	 vibration 	 s 	 	of	the	airstreams	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	the	shape	of	the	instrument	.
now	in	string	 theor 	 y 	 	,	all	the	 number 	 s 	 	are	 reflect 	 ions 	 	of	the	way	 string 	 s 	 	can	 vib 	 rate 	 	.
so	just	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	airstreams	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	the	 twist 	 s 	 	and	 turn 	 s 	 	in	the	instrument	,	 string 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	will	be	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	the	 vibration 	 al 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	the	 geo 	 metry 	 	 with 	 in 	 	which	they	are	moving	.
so	let	me	 br 	 ing 	 	some	 string 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	story	.
and	if	you	watch	these	little	 fellow 	 s 	 	 vib 	 rating 	 	around	--	they	'll	be	there	in	a	second	--	right	there	,	notice	that	they	way	they	 vib 	 rate 	 	is	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	the	 geo 	 metry 	 	of	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
so	,	if	we	 k 	 new 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	look	like	--	we	do	n't	yet	,	but	if	we	did	--	we	should	be	able	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	 allow 	 ed 	 	 note 	 s 	 	,	the	 allow 	 ed 	 	 vibration 	 al 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
and	if	we	could	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	 allow 	 ed 	 	 vibration 	 al 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	we	should	be	able	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	20	 number 	 s 	 	.
and	if	the	answer	that	we	get	from	our	 calcul 	 ations 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	with	the	 value 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 determine 	 d 	 	through	 detail 	 ed 	 	and	precise	 experiment 	 ation 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	would	be	the	first	fundamental	 explan 	 ation 	 	for	why	the	structure	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	the	way	it	is	.
now	,	the	second	issue	that	i	want	to	finish	up	with	is	:	how	might	we	test	for	these	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	more	 direct 	 ly 	 	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	just	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	structure	that	might	be	able	to	explain	some	 previous 	 ly 	 	 un 	 explain 	 ed 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	or	can	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	test	for	these	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	?
and	we	think	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	i	think	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	--	that	in	the	next	five	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	we	may	be	able	to	test	for	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	these	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
here	's	how	it	 go 	 es 	 	.	in	cern	,	geneva	,	switzerland	,	a	machine	is	 be 	 ing 	 	built	 call 	 ed 	 	the	large	hadron	collider	.
it	's	a	machine	that	will	 s 	 end 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	around	a	tunnel	,	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	,	near	the	speed	of	light	.
every	so	often	 t 	 hose 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	will	be	 aim 	 ed 	 	at	each	other	,	so	there	's	a	head	-	on	collision	.
the	hope	is	that	if	the	collision	 ha 	 s 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	energy	,	it	may	eject	some	of	the	 deb 	 ris 	 	from	the	collision	from	our	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	forcing	it	to	enter	 in 	 to 	 	the	other	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
how	would	we	know	it	?
well	,	we	'll	measure	the	amount	of	energy	after	the	collision	,	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	the	amount	of	energy	before	,	and	if	there	's	less	energy	after	the	collision	than	before	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	evidence	that	the	energy	 ha 	 s 	 	 drift 	 ed 	 	away	.
and	if	it	 drift 	 s 	 	away	in	the	right	pattern	that	we	can	 calcul 	 ate 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	evidence	that	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	are	there	.
let	me	show	you	that	idea	 visual 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	imagine	we	have	a	certain	kind	of	particle	 call 	 ed 	 	a	graviton	--	that	's	the	kind	of	 deb 	 ris 	 	we	expect	to	be	 eject 	 ed 	 	out	,	if	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	are	real	.
but	here	's	how	the	experiment	will	go	.
you	take	these	 particle 	 s 	 	.	you	 s 	 lam 	 	them	together	.
you	 s 	 lam 	 	them	together	,	and	if	we	are	right	,	some	of	the	energy	of	that	collision	will	go	 in 	 to 	 	 deb 	 ris 	 	that	flies	off	 in 	 to 	 	these	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	experiment	that	we	'll	be	looking	at	in	the	next	five	,	seven	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	.
and	if	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	 bear 	 s 	 	fruit	,	if	we	see	that	kind	of	particle	 eject 	 ed 	 	by	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	that	there	's	less	energy	in	our	 dimension 	 s 	 	than	when	we	 beg 	 an 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	show	that	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	are	real	.
and	to	me	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	story	,	and	a	 remark 	 able 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	going	back	to	newton	with	absolute	space	--	did	n't	provide	 any 	 thing 	 	but	an	arena	,	a	stage	in	which	the	 event 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	take	place	.
einstein	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	well	,	space	and	time	can	warp	and	 curv 	 e 	 	--	that	's	what	 gravit 	 y 	 	is	.
and	now	string	 theor 	 y 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	 electro 	 magnet 	 ism 	 	,	all	together	in	one	package	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	if	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	more	 dimension 	 s 	 	than	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	see	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	experiment	that	may	test	for	them	in	our	 life 	 time 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
