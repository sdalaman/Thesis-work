i	'd	like	to	do	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	what	i	did	the	first	time	,	which	is	to	 choos 	 e 	 	a	light	-	hearted	theme	.
last	time	,	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	death	and	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	,	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 techno 	 logical 	 	,	so	i	'll	talk	about	 electro 	 shock 	 	therapy	.
you	know	,	ever	since	man	had	any	 not 	 ion 	 	that	some	of	his	other	people	,	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	could	be	different	,	could	be	strange	,	could	be	 severe 	 ly 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	or	what	we	now	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	,	he	was	certain	that	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 ill 	 ness 	 	had	to	come	from	 e 	 vil 	 	 spirit 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	body	.
so	,	the	way	of	 treat 	 ing 	 	these	 disease 	 s 	 	in	early	 time 	 s 	 	was	to	,	in	some	way	or	other	,	 ex 	 or 	 cise 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	 spirit 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	still	going	on	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	.
but	it	was	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	to	use	the	 priest 	 s 	 	.
when	medicine	 be 	 came 	 	 some 	 what 	 	scientific	,	in	about	450	bc	,	with	hippocrates	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	,	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	look	for	 herb 	 s 	 	,	 plant 	 s 	 	that	would	 liter 	 ally 	 	shake	the	bad	 spirit 	 s 	 	out	.
so	,	they	found	certain	 plant 	 s 	 	that	could	cause	 convuls 	 ions 	 	.
and	the	 herb 	 al 	 s 	 	,	the	 botanic 	 al 	 	 book 	 s 	 	of	up	to	the	late	middle	 age 	 s 	 	,	the	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	are	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 prescription 	 s 	 	for	 caus 	 ing 	 	 convuls 	 ions 	 	to	shake	the	 e 	 vil 	 	 spirit 	 s 	 	out	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	in	about	the	sixteenth	century	,	a	physician	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	name	was	theophrastus	bombastus	aureolus	von	hohenheim	,	 call 	 ed 	 	paracelsus	,	a	name	 prob 	 ably 	 	familiar	to	some	people	here	--	--	good	,	old	paracelsus	found	that	he	could	predict	the	degree	of	 convuls 	 ion 	 	by	using	a	 measur 	 ed 	 	amount	of	 camp 	 hor 	 	to	produce	the	 convuls 	 ion 	 	.
can	you	imagine	going	to	your	 close 	 t 	 	,	 pull 	 ing 	 	out	a	 moth 	 ball 	 	,	and	 chew 	 ing 	 	on	it	if	you	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	?
it	's	better	than	prozac	,	but	i	would	n't	recommend	it	.
so	what	we	see	in	the	seventeenth	,	 eight 	 een 	 th 	 	century	is	the	 continu 	 ed 	 	search	for	 medic 	 ations 	 	other	than	 camp 	 hor 	 	that	'll	do	the	trick	.
well	,	 a 	 long 	 	 come 	 s 	 	benjamin	franklin	,	and	he	 come 	 s 	 	close	to	 convuls 	 ing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	with	a	bolt	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	off	the	end	of	his	kite	.
and	so	people	begin	 think 	 ing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	to	produce	 convuls 	 ions 	 	.
and	then	,	we	fast	-	forward	to	about	1932	,	when	three	italian	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 large 	 ly 	 	 treat 	 ing 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	 beg 	 an 	 	to	notice	among	 the 	 ir 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 epileptic 	 s 	 	,	that	if	they	had	an	epileptic	--	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	epileptic	 fit 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	them	in	a	row	--	the	 depress 	 ion 	 	would	 ver 	 y 	 	 frequent 	 ly 	 	lift	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	would	it	lift	,	but	it	might	never	return	.
so	they	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	producing	 convuls 	 ions 	 	,	 measur 	 ed 	 	 type 	 s 	 	of	 convuls 	 ions 	 	.
and	they	thought	,	``	well	,	we	've	got	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	we	'll	plug	 some 	 body 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	wall	.
that	 al 	 ways 	 	 make 	 s 	 	hair	stand	up	and	people	shake	a	lot	.	``
so	,	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	on	a	few	 pig 	 s 	 	,	and	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 pig 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	they	went	to	the	police	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	know	that	at	the	rome	 rail 	 road 	 	station	,	there	are	all	these	lost	 soul 	 s 	 	 wander 	 ing 	 	around	,	 mut 	 tering 	 	 gib 	 ber 	 ish 	 	.	can	you	 br 	 ing 	 	one	of	them	to	us	?	``
 some 	 one 	 	who	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	italians	say	,	``	 cago 	 ot 	 s 	 	.	``
so	they	found	 th 	 is 	 	``	 cago 	 ot 	 s 	 	``	guy	,	a	39	-	year	-	old	man	who	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 hope 	 lessly 	 	schizophrenic	,	who	was	known	,	had	 be 	 en 	 	known	for	 month 	 s 	 	,	to	be	 liter 	 ally 	 	 defec 	 ating 	 	on	 him 	 self 	 	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	made	any	sense	,	and	they	 br 	 ought 	 	him	 in 	 to 	 	the	hospital	.
so	these	three	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	,	after	about	two	or	three	 week 	 s 	 	of	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	laid	him	down	on	a	table	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	his	 temple 	 s 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	source	of	current	.
they	thought	,	``	well	,	we	'll	try	55	 volt 	 s 	 	,	two	-	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	a	second	.
that	's	not	going	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	to	him	.	``
so	they	did	that	.
well	,	i	have	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	from	a	 first 	 hand 	 	 observ 	 er 	 	,	who	told	me	 th 	 is 	 	about	35	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	for	some	research	project	of	mine	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	fellow	``	--	remember	,	he	was	n't	even	put	to	sleep	--	``	after	 th 	 is 	 	major	grand	mal	 convuls 	 ion 	 	,	 s 	 at 	 	right	up	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	these	three	 fell 	 a 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	'	what	the	fuck	are	you	 ass 	 hole 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	?	'	``	if	i	could	 on 	 ly 	 	say	that	in	italian	.
well	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	happy	 a 	 s 	 	could	be	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	had	n't	 s 	 aid 	 	a	rational	word	in	the	 week 	 s 	 	of	 observ 	 ation 	 	.
so	they	 plug 	 ged 	 	him	in	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	time	they	used	110	 volt 	 s 	 	for	half	a	second	.
and	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 amaze 	 ment 	 	,	after	it	was	over	,	he	 beg 	 an 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	like	he	was	 perfect 	 ly 	 	well	.
he	 re 	 lapse 	 d 	 	a	little	bit	,	they	 g 	 ave 	 	him	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	and	he	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	 cur 	 ed 	 	.
but	of	course	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	,	it	 return 	 ed 	 	.
but	they	wrote	a	paper	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	western	world	 beg 	 an 	 	using	 electric 	 ity 	 	to	 convuls 	 e 	 	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	either	schizophrenic	or	 severe 	 ly 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	.
it	did	n't	work	 ver 	 y 	 	well	on	the	 schizophrenic 	 s 	 	,	but	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	clear	in	the	'30s	and	by	the	middle	of	the	'40s	that	 electro 	 convuls 	 ive 	 	therapy	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	in	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	of	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
and	of	course	,	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 anti 	 depress 	 ant 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	.
they	would	 anesthet 	 ize 	 	people	,	 convuls 	 e 	 	them	,	but	the	real	 difficult 	 y 	 	was	that	there	was	no	way	to	paralyze	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
so	people	would	have	a	real	grand	mal	seizure	.
 bone 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	broken	.	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	old	,	fragile	people	,	you	could	n't	use	it	.
and	then	in	the	1950s	,	late	1950s	,	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	muscle	 relax 	 ants 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	 pharmaco 	 logists 	 	,	and	it	got	so	that	you	could	induce	a	complete	 convuls 	 ion 	 	,	an	 electro 	 encephalo 	 graphic 	 	 convuls 	 ion 	 	--	you	could	see	it	on	the	brain	 wave 	 s 	 	--	 with 	 out 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	any	 convuls 	 ion 	 	in	the	body	 ex 	 cept 	 	a	little	bit	of	 twitch 	 ing 	 	of	the	 to 	 es 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	and	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
well	,	you	know	,	in	the	middle	'60s	,	the	first	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	came	out	.	tofranil	was	the	first	.
in	the	late	'70s	,	early	'80s	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	.
and	 patient 	 s 	 	'	 right 	 s 	 	 group 	 s 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	get	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	about	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	would	witness	.
and	so	the	whole	idea	of	 electro 	 convuls 	 ive 	 	,	 electro 	 shock 	 	therapy	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	the	reason	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	is	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	10	percent	of	the	people	,	severe	 depress 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	do	not	respond	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	what	is	 d 	 one 	 	for	them	.
now	,	why	am	i	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	at	 th 	 is 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	?
i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	ever	since	richard	 call 	 ed 	 	me	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	talk	about	--	 a 	 s 	 	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	all	of	his	 speaker 	 s 	 	--	to	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	be	new	to	 th 	 is 	 	audience	,	that	we	had	never	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	never	written	about	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 plan 	 ning 	 	 th 	 is 	 	moment	.
 th 	 is 	 	reason	 re 	 ally 	 	is	that	i	am	a	man	who	,	 al 	 most 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	had	his	life	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	two	long	 course 	 s 	 	of	 electro 	 shock 	 	therapy	.
and	let	me	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
i	was	,	in	the	1960s	,	in	a	marriage	.	to	use	the	word	bad	would	be	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 under 	 state 	 ment 	 	of	the	year	.
it	was	 dread 	 ful 	 	.
there	are	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 en 	 ough 	 	 divorce 	 d 	 	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	to	know	about	the	 hostil 	 ity 	 	,	the	anger	,	who	 know 	 s 	 	what	.
 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	who	had	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 child 	 hood 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	adolescence	--	it	had	to	do	with	not	 quit 	 e 	 	poverty	but	close	.
it	had	to	do	with	 be 	 ing 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	up	in	a	family	where	no	one	spoke	english	,	no	one	could	read	or	write	english	.
it	had	to	do	with	death	and	disease	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	was	a	little	prone	to	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	got	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	hate	each	other	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	 progress 	 ively 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	over	a	period	of	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 th 	 is 	 	marriage	,	which	was	 inevit 	 ably 	 	not	to	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	schedule	--	all	my	major	 sur 	 gical 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 sch 	 ed 	 ul 	 ing 	 	them	for	12	,	one	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	afternoon	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	could	n't	get	out	of	bed	before	about	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	.
and	 any 	 body 	 	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	here	 know 	 s 	 	what	that	's	like	.
i	could	n't	even	pull	the	 cover 	 s 	 	off	 my 	 self 	 	.
well	,	you	're	in	a	university	medical	center	,	where	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	 every 	 body 	 	,	and	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	clear	to	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	so	my	 refer 	 ral 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 de 	 crease 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	my	 refer 	 ral 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 de 	 crease 	 	,	i	 clear 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	 un 	 til 	 	i	thought	,	my	god	,	i	ca	n't	work	 any 	 more 	 	.
and	,	in	fact	,	it	did	n't	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	have	any	 patient 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	,	with	the	 ad 	 vice 	 	of	my	physician	,	i	had	 my 	 self 	 	admitted	to	the	 a 	 cute 	 	care	 psych 	 iatric 	 	unit	of	our	university	hospital	.
and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	who	had	known	me	since	medical	school	in	that	place	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	worry	,	chap	.	six	 week 	 s 	 	,	you	're	back	in	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	.	 every 	 thing 	 	's	going	to	be	great	.	``
well	,	you	know	what	 bo 	 vine 	 	 ster 	 cus 	 	is	?
that	 prov 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	lot	of	 bo 	 vine 	 	 ster 	 cus 	 	.
i	know	some	people	who	got	 ten 	 ure 	 	in	that	place	with	lies	like	that	.
so	i	was	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	.
but	it	was	n't	that	simple	.	 be 	 cause 	 	by	the	time	i	got	out	of	that	unit	,	i	was	not	functional	at	all	.
i	could	 hard 	 ly 	 	see	five	feet	in	front	of	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	 shuffl 	 ed 	 	when	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	.	i	was	 bow 	 ed 	 	over	.
i	 rare 	 ly 	 	 bath 	 ed 	 	.	i	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	did	n't	 s 	 have 	 	.	it	was	 dread 	 ful 	 	.
and	it	was	clear	--	not	to	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	was	clear	to	me	at	that	time	 any 	 more 	 	--	that	i	would	need	long	-	term	 hospital 	 ization 	 	in	that	awful	place	 call 	 ed 	 	a	mental	hospital	.
so	i	was	admitted	,	in	1973	,	in	the	spring	of	1973	,	to	the	institute	of	living	,	which	used	to	be	 call 	 ed 	 	the	hartford	 re 	 treat 	 	.
it	was	 found 	 ed 	 	in	the	 eight 	 een 	 th 	 	century	,	the	largest	 psych 	 iatric 	 	hospital	in	the	state	of	connecticut	,	other	than	the	huge	public	 hospital 	 s 	 	that	 exist 	 ed 	 	at	that	time	.
and	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	they	had	.
they	 tri 	 ed 	 	the	usual	 psycho 	 therapy 	 	.
they	 tri 	 ed 	 	every	 medic 	 ation 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	they	did	have	tofranil	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	--	mellaril	,	who	 know 	 s 	 	what	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	i	got	 jaundice 	 d 	 	from	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	well	known	in	connecticut	,	they	 decide 	 d 	 	they	better	have	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	of	the	senior	staff	.
all	the	senior	staff	got	together	,	and	i	 lat 	 er 	 	found	out	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
they	put	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	together	and	they	 decide 	 d 	 	that	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	surgeon	who	had	 essential 	 ly 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	from	the	world	,	who	by	that	time	had	 be 	 come 	 	so	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	,	not	just	with	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 worth 	 lessness 	 	and	 in 	 ad 	 equ 	 acy 	 	,	but	with	 obsession 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 obsession 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 co 	 incidence 	 s 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 number 	 s 	 	that	every	time	i	saw	them	,	just	got	me	 dread 	 fully 	 	 up 	 set 	 	--	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 ritual 	 istic 	 	 observ 	 ance 	 s 	 	,	just	awful	,	awful	stuff	.
remember	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	kid	,	and	you	had	to	step	on	every	line	?
well	,	i	was	a	grown	man	who	had	all	of	these	 ritual 	 s 	 	,	and	it	got	so	there	was	a	 th 	 rob 	 bing 	 	,	there	was	a	ferocious	fear	in	my	head	.
you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	by	edvard	munch	,	the	 s 	 cream 	 	.	every	moment	was	a	 s 	 cream 	 	.
it	was	 im 	 possible 	 	.	so	they	 decide 	 d 	 	there	was	no	therapy	,	there	was	no	 treat 	 ment 	 	.	but	there	was	one	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	at	the	hartford	hospital	in	the	early	1940s	,	and	you	can	imagine	what	it	was	.	it	was	pre	-	frontal	 lob 	 otomy 	 	.
so	they	 decide 	 d 	 	--	i	did	n't	know	 th 	 is 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	out	 lat 	 er 	 	--	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	was	for	 th 	 is 	 	43	-	year	-	old	man	to	have	a	pre	-	frontal	 lob 	 otomy 	 	.
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	all	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	there	was	a	resident	 assign 	 ed 	 	to	my	case	.	he	was	27	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	he	would	meet	with	me	two	or	three	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	.
and	of	course	,	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	what	,	three	or	four	 month 	 s 	 	at	the	time	.
and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	meet	with	the	senior	staff	,	and	they	 agree 	 d 	 	to	meet	with	him	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	well	thought	of	in	that	place	.
they	thought	he	had	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	future	.
and	he	 d 	 ug 	 	in	his	 heel 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	.	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	man	better	than	any	of	you	.	i	have	met	with	him	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
you	've	just	 s 	 een 	 	him	from	time	to	time	.	you	've	read	 report 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	 honest 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	problem	here	is	 pur 	 e 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	and	all	of	the	 obsession 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	it	.
and	you	know	,	of	course	,	what	'll	happen	if	you	do	a	pre	-	frontal	 lob 	 otomy 	 	.
any	of	the	 result 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	spectrum	,	from	 pre 	 tty 	 	bad	to	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	is	going	to	happen	.	if	he	 do 	 es 	 	the	best	he	can	,	he	will	have	no	further	 obsession 	 s 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	no	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	but	his	affect	will	be	 dull 	 ed 	 	,	he	will	never	go	back	to	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	he	will	never	be	the	loving	father	that	he	was	to	his	two	children	,	his	life	will	be	 change 	 d 	 	.	if	he	 ha 	 s 	 	the	usual	result	,	he	will	end	up	like	'	one	flew	over	the	cuckoo	's	nest	.	'	and	you	know	about	that	,	just	 essential 	 ly 	 	in	a	stupor	the	rest	of	his	life	.	``
well	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ca	n't	we	try	a	course	of	 electro 	 shock 	 	therapy	?	``
and	you	know	why	they	 agree 	 d 	 	?	they	 agree 	 d 	 	to	humor	him	.
they	just	thought	,	``	well	,	we	'll	give	a	course	of	10	.
and	so	we	'll	lose	a	little	time	.	big	deal	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	.	``
so	they	 g 	 ave 	 	the	course	of	10	,	and	the	first	--	the	usual	course	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	was	six	to	eight	and	still	is	six	to	eight	.
 plug 	 ged 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	the	 wire 	 s 	 	,	put	me	to	sleep	,	 g 	 ave 	 	me	the	muscle	 relax 	 ant 	 	.
six	did	n't	work	.	seven	did	n't	work	.
eight	did	n't	work	.	at	nine	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	--	and	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	that	i	could	notice	 any 	 thing 	 	--	i	 notice 	 d 	 	a	change	.	and	at	10	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	a	real	change	.
and	he	went	back	to	them	,	and	they	 agree 	 d 	 	to	do	 an 	 other 	 	10	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	not	a	single	one	of	them	--	i	think	there	are	about	seven	or	eight	of	them	--	thought	 th 	 is 	 	would	do	any	good	.	they	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 tempor 	 ary 	 	change	.
but	,	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	by	16	,	by	17	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 demonst 	 r 	 able 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	the	way	i	felt	.
by	18	and	19	,	i	was	 sleep 	 ing 	 	through	the	night	.
and	by	20	,	i	had	the	sense	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	had	the	sense	that	i	could	 over 	 come 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	i	was	now	strong	 en 	 ough 	 	that	by	an	act	of	will	,	i	could	blow	the	 obsession 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	away	.
i	could	blow	the	 depress 	 ion 	 	away	.
and	i	've	never	 for 	 gotten 	 	--	i	never	will	forget	--	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	kitchen	of	the	unit	,	it	was	a	sunday	 morn 	 ing 	 	in	january	of	1974	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	kitchen	by	 my 	 self 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	've	got	the	strength	now	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
it	was	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	 coil 	 ed 	 	 wire 	 s 	 	in	my	head	had	 be 	 en 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	and	i	could	think	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
but	i	need	a	formula	.	i	need	some	thing	to	say	to	 my 	 self 	 	when	i	begin	 think 	 ing 	 	 obsession 	 ally 	 	,	 obsess 	 ively 	 	.
well	,	the	gilbert	and	sullivan	 fan 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	will	remember	``	ruddigore	,	``	and	they	will	remember	mad	margaret	,	and	they	will	remember	that	she	was	married	to	a	fellow	named	 s 	 ir 	 	despard	murgatroyd	.
and	she	used	to	go	nuts	,	every	five	 minute 	 s 	 	or	so	in	the	play	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	,	``	we	must	have	a	word	to	 br 	 ing 	 	you	back	to	 re 	 ality 	 	,	and	the	word	,	my	dear	,	will	be	'	basingstoke	.	'	``	so	every	time	she	got	a	little	nuts	,	he	would	say	,	``	basingstoke	!	``	and	she	would	say	,	``	basingstoke	,	it	is	.	``	and	she	would	be	fine	for	a	little	while	.
well	,	you	know	,	i	'm	from	the	bronx	.	i	ca	n't	say	``	basingstoke	.	``
but	i	had	 some 	 thing 	 	better	.	and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
it	was	,	``	ah	,	fuck	it	!	``
much	better	than	``	basingstoke	,	``	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	me	.	and	it	 work 	 ed 	 	--	my	god	,	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.
every	time	i	would	begin	 think 	 ing 	 	 obsession 	 ally 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	once	more	,	after	20	shock	 treat 	 ments 	 	--	i	would	say	,	``	ah	,	fuck	it	.	``
and	 thing 	 s 	 	got	better	and	better	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	three	or	four	 month 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 dis 	 charged 	 	from	that	hospital	,	and	i	 join 	 ed 	 	a	group	of	 surgeon 	 s 	 	where	i	could	work	with	other	people	in	the	community	,	not	in	new	 have 	 n 	 	,	but	 fair 	 ly 	 	close	by	.
i	 stay 	 ed 	 	there	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
at	the	end	of	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	went	back	to	new	 have 	 n 	 	,	had	 re 	 married 	 	by	that	time	.
i	 br 	 ought 	 	my	wife	with	me	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	i	could	get	through	 th 	 is 	 	.
my	children	came	back	to	live	with	us	.
we	had	two	more	children	after	that	.
 re 	 suscit 	 ated 	 	the	 care 	 er 	 	,	even	better	than	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	before	.
went	right	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	university	and	 beg 	 an 	 	to	write	 book 	 s 	 	.
well	,	you	know	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	life	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	close	to	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	 stop 	 ped 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	about	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	 be 	 came 	 	a	full	-	time	writer	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	know	.
but	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	.
every	once	in	a	while	,	i	have	to	say	,	``	ah	,	fuck	it	.	``
every	once	in	a	while	,	i	get	 some 	 what 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	and	a	little	 obsession 	 al 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	not	free	of	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	.	but	it	's	 work 	 ed 	 	.	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	.
why	have	i	 chose 	 n 	 	,	after	never	,	ever	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	talk	about	it	now	?
well	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	know	some	of	these	 book 	 s 	 	know	that	one	is	about	death	and	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	one	is	about	the	human	body	and	the	human	spirit	,	one	is	about	the	way	 mystic 	 al 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	in	our	 mind 	 s 	 	,	and	they	have	 al 	 ways 	 	to	do	with	my	own	personal	 experience 	 s 	 	.
one	might	think	 read 	 ing 	 	these	 book 	 s 	 	--	and	i	've	gotten	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 letter 	 s 	 	about	them	by	people	who	do	think	 th 	 is 	 	--	that	based	on	my	life	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 port 	 ray 	 ed 	 	in	the	 book 	 s 	 	,	my	early	life	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	i	am	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 over 	 come 	 	 advers 	 ity 	 	.
that	i	am	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	drunk	,	 d 	 rank 	 	,	drunk	of	the	bitter	dregs	of	near	-	disaster	in	 child 	 hood 	 	and	 emerge 	 d 	 	not	just	 un 	 s 	 cath 	 ed 	 	but	 strength 	 ened 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	have	it	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	,	so	that	i	can	advise	people	about	death	and	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	so	that	i	can	talk	about	 mystic 	 ism 	 	and	the	human	spirit	.
and	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	 guilt 	 y 	 	about	that	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	that	 some 	 how 	 	i	was	an	 im 	 post 	 or 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 read 	 ers 	 	do	n't	know	what	i	have	just	told	you	.
it	's	known	by	some	people	in	new	 have 	 n 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	but	it	is	not	 general 	 ly 	 	known	.
so	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	that	i	have	come	here	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	to	--	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	 self 	 ish 	 ly 	 	--	 un 	 burden 	 	 my 	 self 	 	and	let	it	be	known	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	 un 	 trouble 	 d 	 	mind	that	 ha 	 s 	 	written	all	of	these	 book 	 s 	 	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	,	is	the	fact	that	a	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	proportion	of	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	are	under	30	,	and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	of	course	,	who	are	well	over	30	.
for	people	under	30	,	and	it	 look 	 s 	 	to	me	like	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	you	--	i	would	say	all	of	you	--	are	either	on	the	 cus 	 p 	 	of	a	 magnific 	 ent 	 	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	 care 	 er 	 	or	right	 in 	 to 	 	a	 magnific 	 ent 	 	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	 care 	 er 	 	:	 any 	 thing 	 	can	happen	to	you	.	 thing 	 s 	 	change	.
 accident 	 s 	 	happen	.	 some 	 thing 	 	from	 child 	 hood 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	haunt	you	.
you	can	be	 throw 	 n 	 	off	the	track	.
i	hope	it	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 non 	 e 	 	of	you	,	but	it	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	happen	to	a	small	 percent 	 age 	 	of	you	.
to	 t 	 hose 	 	to	whom	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	,	there	will	be	 advers 	 ities 	 	.
if	i	,	with	the	 b 	 leak 	 ness 	 	of	spirit	,	with	no	spirit	,	that	i	had	in	the	1970s	and	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	that	group	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	thought	,	if	i	can	find	my	way	back	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	 any 	 body 	 	can	find	 the 	 ir 	 	way	back	from	any	 advers 	 ity 	 	that	 exist 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 old 	 er 	 	,	who	have	lived	through	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	bad	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	who	have	lived	through	difficult	 time 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	where	they	lost	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	,	and	 start 	 ed 	 	out	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	some	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	will	seem	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	.
there	is	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
there	is	 re 	 de 	 mption 	 	.	and	there	is	 resurrect 	 ion 	 	.
there	are	 resurrect 	 ion 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	in	every	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	,	and	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	not	just	 on 	 ly 	 	do	we	 fanta 	 s 	 ize 	 	about	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 resurrect 	 ion 	 	and	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	,	but	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.	and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	popular	 resurrect 	 ion 	 	theme	,	 out 	 side 	 	of	 specific 	 ally 	 	religious	 one 	 s 	 	,	is	the	one	about	the	phoenix	,	the	ancient	story	of	the	phoenix	,	who	,	every	500	 year 	 s 	 	,	 resurrect 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	from	 it 	 s 	 	own	ashes	to	go	on	to	live	a	life	that	is	even	more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	than	it	was	before	.	richard	,	 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
