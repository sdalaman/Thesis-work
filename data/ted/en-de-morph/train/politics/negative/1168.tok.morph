a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	i	was	 attend 	 ing 	 	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	in	long	beach	,	i	met	harriet	.
we	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	met	 on 	 line 	 	before	--	not	the	way	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	both	 k 	 new 	 	linda	avey	,	one	of	the	 founder 	 s 	 	of	the	first	 on 	 line 	 	personal	genomic	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 share 	 d 	 	our	genetic	information	with	linda	,	she	could	see	that	harriet	and	i	 share 	 d 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	type	of	 mitochondria 	 l 	 	dna	--	haplotype	k	1a1b1a	--	which	 me 	 ant 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 di 	 stant 	 ly 	 	related	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	share	the	same	 genea 	 logy 	 	with	ozzie	the	 ice 	 man 	 	.
so	ozzie	,	harriet	and	me	.
and	 be 	 ing 	 	the	current	day	,	of	course	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	our	own	facebook	group	.
you	're	all	welcome	to	join	.
and	when	i	met	harriet	in	person	the	next	year	at	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	,	she	'd	gone	 on 	 line 	 	and	 order 	 ed 	 	our	own	happy	haplotype	t	-	 shirt 	 s 	 	.
now	why	am	i	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	have	to	do	with	the	future	of	health	?
well	the	way	i	met	harriet	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	 lever 	 aging 	 	cross	-	disciplinary	,	 exponential 	 ly 	 	-	growing	 techno 	 logies 	 	is	 affect 	 ing 	 	our	future	of	health	and	 well 	 ness 	 	--	from	low	-	cost	gene	analysis	to	the	ability	to	do	 power 	 ful 	 	bio	-	informatics	to	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	social	 network 	 ing 	 	.
what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	 understand 	 ing 	 	these	exponential	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
we	often	think	 linear 	 ly 	 	.
but	if	you	think	about	it	,	if	you	have	a	 li 	 ly 	 	pad	and	it	just	 divid 	 ed 	 	every	single	day	--	two	,	four	,	eight	,	16	--	in	15	 day 	 s 	 	you	have	32,000	.
what	do	you	think	you	have	in	a	month	?	we	're	at	a	billion	.
so	if	we	start	to	think	 exponential 	 ly 	 	,	we	can	see	how	 th 	 is 	 	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	affect	all	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	around	us	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	--	 s 	 peaking 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	physician	and	 innov 	 ator 	 	--	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	start	to	leverage	to	impact	the	future	of	our	own	health	and	of	health	care	,	and	to	address	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	major	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	we	have	in	health	care	 to 	 day 	 	,	ranging	from	the	 re 	 ally 	 	exponential	 cost 	 s 	 	to	the	aging	population	,	the	way	we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	use	information	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	 fragment 	 ation 	 	of	care	and	often	the	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	course	of	 adopt 	 ion 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
and	one	of	the	major	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	do	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	bit	about	here	 to 	 day 	 	is	moving	the	 curv 	 e 	 	to	the	left	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	our	money	on	the	last	20	percent	of	life	.
what	if	we	could	 s 	 pend 	 	and	incentivize	 position 	 s 	 	in	the	health	care	system	and	our	own	self	to	move	the	 curv 	 e 	 	to	the	left	and	improve	our	health	,	 lever 	 aging 	 	technology	 a 	 s 	 	well	?
now	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	technology	,	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	exponential	technology	,	we	all	have	in	our	pocket	.
so	if	you	think	about	it	,	these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 improv 	 ing 	 	.
i	mean	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	iphone	4	.
imagine	what	the	iphone	8	will	be	able	to	do	.
now	,	i	've	 gain 	 ed 	 	some	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	the	track	share	for	the	medicine	 port 	 ion 	 	of	a	new	institution	 call 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	university	based	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	.
and	we	 br 	 ing 	 	together	every	summer	about	100	 ver 	 y 	 	 talent 	 ed 	 	 student 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	.
and	we	look	at	these	exponential	 techno 	 logies 	 	from	medicine	,	 bio 	 tech 	 	,	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	 robotic 	 s 	 	,	 nano 	 technology 	 	,	space	,	and	address	how	can	we	cross	-	train	and	leverage	these	to	impact	major	 un 	 met 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	seven	-	day	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	 program 	 s 	 	.
and	coming	up	next	month	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	future	med	,	a	program	to	help	cross	-	train	and	leverage	 techno 	 logies 	 	 in 	 to 	 	medicine	.
now	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	the	phone	.
these	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	have	over	20,000	different	mobile	 app 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	--	to	the	point	where	there	's	one	out	of	the	u.k	.
where	you	can	 pe 	 e 	 	on	a	little	chip	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	your	iphone	and	check	 your 	 self 	 	for	an	std	.
i	do	n't	know	if	i	'd	try	that	yet	,	but	that	's	 avail 	 able 	 	.
there	are	all	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 application 	 s 	 	,	 mer 	 ging 	 	your	phone	and	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	 measur 	 ing 	 	your	blood	glucose	on	your	iphone	and	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	that	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	,	to	your	physician	so	they	can	better	understand	and	you	can	better	understand	your	blood	 sugar 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	diabetic	.
so	let	's	see	now	how	exponential	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	taking	health	care	.
let	's	start	with	 fast 	 er 	 	.
well	it	's	no	secret	that	 computer 	 s 	 	,	through	moore	's	law	,	are	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	.
we	have	the	ability	to	do	more	 power 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	with	them	.
they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 approach 	 ing 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	 surpass 	 ing 	 	,	the	ability	of	the	human	mind	.
but	where	i	think	 computation 	 al 	 	speed	is	most	 appli 	 cable 	 	is	in	that	of	 im 	 aging 	 	.
the	ability	now	to	look	 in 	 side 	 	the	body	in	real	time	with	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 re 	 solution 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
and	we	're	 layer 	 ing 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	--	pet	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	,	ct	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	and	 mole 	 cular 	 	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	--	to	find	and	to	seek	 thing 	 s 	 	at	different	 level 	 s 	 	.
here	you	're	going	to	see	the	 ver 	 y 	 	highest	 re 	 solution 	 	mri	 s 	 can 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 re 	 construct 	 ed 	 	of	marc	hodosh	,	the	 cur 	 ator 	 	of	tedmed	.
and	now	we	can	see	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	brain	with	a	 re 	 solution 	 	and	ability	that	was	never	before	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	 essential 	 ly 	 	learn	how	to	 re 	 construct 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	re	-	engineer	,	or	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	engineer	,	the	brain	so	we	can	better	understand	 path 	 ology 	 	,	disease	and	therapy	.
we	can	look	 in 	 side 	 	with	real	time	fmri	--	in	the	brain	at	real	time	.
and	by	 understand 	 ing 	 	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 process 	 es 	 	and	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	we	're	going	to	understand	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 medic 	 ation 	 	or	 medit 	 ation 	 	and	better	 personal 	 ize 	 	and	make	effective	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	psychoactive	 drug 	 s 	 	.
the	 scanner 	 s 	 	for	these	are	 get 	 ting 	 	small	,	less	expensive	and	more	 port 	 able 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	data	explosion	 avail 	 able 	 	from	these	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
the	 s 	 can 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	 take 	 s 	 	up	about	800	 book 	 s 	 	,	or	20	 gigabyte 	 s 	 	.
the	 s 	 can 	 	in	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	will	be	one	 tera 	 byte 	 	,	or	800,000	 book 	 s 	 	.
how	do	you	leverage	that	information	?
let	's	get	personal	.	i	wo	n't	ask	who	here	's	had	a	 colon 	 os 	 copy 	 	,	but	if	you	're	over	age	50	,	it	's	time	for	your	 screen 	 ing 	 	 colon 	 os 	 copy 	 	.
how	would	you	like	to	avoid	the	 point 	 y 	 	end	of	the	stick	?
well	now	there	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	virtual	 colon 	 os 	 copy 	 	.
 compar 	 e 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 picture 	 s 	 	,	and	now	 a 	 s 	 	a	 radio 	 logist 	 	,	you	can	 essential 	 ly 	 	fly	through	your	patient	's	colon	and	,	 augment 	 ing 	 	that	with	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	identify	 potential 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	,	a	 les 	 ion 	 	.
oh	,	we	might	have	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	it	,	but	using	a.i	.	on	top	of	 radio 	 logy 	 	,	we	can	find	 les 	 ions 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	before	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	will	 encourag 	 e 	 	people	to	get	 colon 	 os 	 copies 	 	that	would	n't	have	 other 	 wise 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	paradigm	shift	.
we	're	moving	to	 th 	 is 	 	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	 bio 	 medicine 	 	,	information	technology	,	 wire 	 less 	 	and	,	i	would	say	,	mobile	now	--	 th 	 is 	 	era	of	digital	medicine	.
so	even	my	stethoscope	is	now	digital	.
and	of	course	,	there	's	an	app	for	that	.
we	're	moving	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	to	the	era	of	the	 tric 	 order 	 	.
so	the	 hand 	 held 	 	 ultra 	 sound 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 surpass 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 up 	 plant 	 ing 	 	the	stethoscope	.
these	are	now	at	a	price	point	of	--	what	used	to	be	100,000	 eur 	 os 	 	or	a	couple	of	hundred	-	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	for	about	5,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	i	can	have	the	power	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	in	my	hand	.
and	 mer 	 ging 	 	 th 	 is 	 	now	with	the	 ad 	 vent 	 	of	 electron 	 ic 	 	medical	 record 	 s 	 	--	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	we	're	still	less	than	20	percent	 electron 	 ic 	 	.
here	in	the	netherlands	,	i	think	it	's	more	than	80	percent	.
but	now	that	we	're	 s 	 witch 	 ing 	 	to	 mer 	 ging 	 	medical	data	,	making	it	 avail 	 able 	 	 electron 	 ically 	 	,	we	can	crowd	source	that	information	,	and	now	 a 	 s 	 	a	physician	,	i	can	access	my	 patient 	 s 	 	'	data	from	 where 	 ver 	 	i	am	just	through	my	mobile	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	now	,	of	course	,	we	're	in	the	era	of	the	ipad	,	even	the	ipad	2	.
and	just	last	month	the	first	fda	-	approved	application	was	approved	to	allow	 radio 	 logists 	 	to	do	actual	 read 	 ing 	 	on	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
so	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	the	 physician 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 reli 	 able 	 	on	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	saw	just	about	a	month	ago	,	watson	from	ibm	beat	the	two	 champion 	 s 	 	in	 jeopard 	 y 	 	.
so	i	want	you	to	imagine	when	in	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	when	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 app 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cloud	-	based	information	,	when	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	a.i	.	physician	and	leverage	our	 brain 	 s 	 	to	 connect 	 ivity 	 	to	make	 decision 	 s 	 	and	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	at	a	level	never	 d 	 one 	 	.
 al 	 ready 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	do	n't	need	to	go	to	your	physician	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	for	about	20	percent	of	actual	 visit 	 s 	 	do	you	have	to	lay	 hand 	 s 	 	on	the	patient	.
we	're	now	in	the	era	of	virtual	 visit 	 s 	 	--	from	sort	of	the	skype	-	type	 visit 	 s 	 	you	can	do	with	american	well	,	to	cisco	that	's	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	health	presence	system	.
the	ability	to	interact	with	your	health	care	 provide 	 r 	 	is	different	.
and	these	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 augment 	 ed 	 	even	by	our	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
here	my	friend	jessica	 s 	 ent 	 	me	a	picture	of	her	head	 lace 	 ration 	 	so	i	can	 s 	 ave 	 	her	a	trip	to	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	--	i	can	do	some	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	that	way	.
or	might	we	be	able	to	leverage	 to 	 day 	 	's	 gam 	 ing 	 	technology	,	like	the	 micro 	 soft 	 	kinect	,	and	hack	that	to	 en 	 able 	 	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	 diagnos 	 ing 	 	stroke	,	using	simple	motion	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	using	hundred	-	dollar	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	now	visit	our	 patient 	 s 	 	 robotic 	 ally 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	rp	7	;	if	i	'm	a	 hemato 	 logist 	 	,	visit	 an 	 other 	 	clinic	,	visit	a	hospital	.
these	will	be	 augment 	 ed 	 	by	a	whole	 suit 	 e 	 	of	 tool 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	home	now	.
so	imagine	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 wire 	 less 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	.
you	can	step	on	the	scale	.
you	can	tweet	your	weight	to	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	keep	you	in	line	.
we	have	 wire 	 less 	 	blood	pressure	 cuff 	 s 	 	.
a	whole	 ga 	 mut 	 	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	put	together	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 wear 	 ing 	 	these	kludgy	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	we	can	put	on	a	simple	patch	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	at	stanford	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	irhythm	--	 complete 	 ly 	 	 s 	 up 	 plant 	 s 	 	the	prior	technology	at	a	much	lower	price	point	with	much	more	effectivity	.
now	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	era	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	of	 quant 	 ified 	 	self	.
 consumer 	 s 	 	now	can	buy	 bas 	 ically 	 	hundred	-	dollar	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	little	fitbit	.
i	can	measure	my	 step 	 s 	 	,	my	caloric	 out 	 take 	 	.
i	can	get	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
i	can	share	that	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	with	my	physician	.
there	's	 watch 	 es 	 	coming	out	that	will	measure	your	heart	rate	,	the	zeo	sleep	 monitor 	 s 	 	,	a	whole	 suit 	 e 	 	of	 tool 	 s 	 	that	can	 en 	 able 	 	you	to	leverage	and	have	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	own	health	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	start	to	integrate	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	we	're	going	to	know	better	what	to	do	with	it	and	how	better	to	have	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	own	 patho 	 logies 	 	,	health	and	 well 	 ness 	 	.
there	's	even	 mirror 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	can	pick	up	your	 puls 	 e 	 	rate	.
and	i	would	 argu 	 e 	 	,	in	the	future	,	we	'll	have	 wear 	 able 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	in	our	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	 monitor 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	24/7	.
and	just	like	we	have	the	onstar	system	in	 car 	 s 	 	,	your	red	light	might	go	on	--	it	wo	n't	say	``	check	engine	``	 th 	 ough 	 	.
it	's	going	to	be	``	check	your	body	``	light	,	and	go	in	and	get	it	taken	care	of	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	in	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	check	 in 	 to 	 	your	mirror	and	it	's	going	to	be	 diagnos 	 ing 	 	you	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	with	 kid 	 do 	 s 	 	at	home	,	how	would	you	like	to	have	the	 wire 	 less 	 	 dia 	 per 	 	that	 support 	 s 	 	your	...
too	much	information	,	i	think	,	than	you	might	need	.
but	it	's	going	to	be	here	.
now	we	've	heard	a	lot	 to 	 day 	 	about	new	technology	and	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	think	some	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	will	 en 	 able 	 	us	to	be	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	our	 patient 	 s 	 	,	and	take	more	time	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	the	 import 	 ant 	 	human	touch	 element 	 s 	 	of	medicine	,	 a 	 s 	 	 augment 	 ed 	 	by	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
now	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 augment 	 ing 	 	the	patient	,	to	some	degree	.
how	about	 augment 	 ing 	 	the	physician	?
we	're	now	in	the	era	of	super	-	 enabl 	 ing 	 	the	surgeon	who	can	now	go	 in 	 side 	 	the	body	and	do	 thing 	 s 	 	with	robotic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	which	is	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	at	a	level	that	was	not	 re 	 ally 	 	possible	even	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 augment 	 ed 	 	with	further	 layer 	 s 	 	of	technology	like	 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
so	the	surgeon	can	see	 in 	 side 	 	the	patient	,	through	 the 	 ir 	 	lens	,	where	the	tumor	is	,	where	the	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	are	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 integrate 	 d 	 	with	 decision 	 s 	 	support	.
a	surgeon	in	new	york	can	be	 help 	 ing 	 	a	surgeon	in	amsterdam	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
and	we	're	 enter 	 ing 	 	an	era	of	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	 scar 	 less 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 note 	 s 	 	,	where	the	robotic	 endo 	 scope 	 	can	come	out	the	stomach	and	pull	out	that	 gall 	 bladder 	 	all	in	a	 scar 	 less 	 	way	and	 robotic 	 ally 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 note 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	coming	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	 scar 	 less 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 mediate 	 d 	 	by	robotic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
now	how	about	 controll 	 ing 	 	other	 element 	 s 	 	?
for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	 dis 	 abilities 	 	--	the	paraplegic	--	there	's	the	era	of	brain	-	computer	 inter 	 face 	 	,	or	bci	,	where	 chip 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	put	on	the	motor	cortex	of	 complete 	 ly 	 	 quad 	 rip 	 leg 	 ic 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	and	they	can	control	a	 cur 	 s 	 er 	 	or	a	wheelchair	or	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	a	robotic	arm	.
and	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 small 	 er 	 	and	going	 in 	 to 	 	more	and	more	of	these	 patient 	 s 	 	.
still	in	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	but	imagine	when	we	can	connect	these	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	to	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 nic 	 	limb	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	deka	arm	built	by	dean	kamen	and	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	17	 degree 	 s 	 	of	motion	and	 free 	 dom 	 	and	can	allow	the	person	who	's	lost	a	limb	to	have	much	 high 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	of	 dexter 	 ity 	 	or	control	than	they	've	had	in	the	past	.
so	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	era	of	 wear 	 able 	 	 robotic 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
if	you	have	n't	lost	a	limb	--	you	've	had	a	stroke	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	you	can	wear	these	 augment 	 ed 	 	 limb 	 s 	 	.
or	if	you	're	a	paraplegic	--	like	i	've	 visit 	 ed 	 	the	 folk 	 s 	 	at	berkley	 bio 	 nic 	 s 	 	--	they	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	elegs	.
i	took	 th 	 is 	 	video	last	week	.	here	's	a	paraplegic	patient	 actual 	 ly 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	by	 s 	 trapping 	 	on	these	 exo 	 skeleton 	 s 	 	.
he	's	 other 	 wise 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	wheelchair	-	bound	.
and	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	early	era	of	 wear 	 able 	 	 robotic 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	by	 lever 	 aging 	 	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	we	're	going	to	change	the	definition	of	 dis 	 ability 	 	to	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	be	 super 	 ability 	 	,	or	super	-	 enabl 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	aimee	mullins	,	who	lost	her	lower	 limb 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	child	,	and	hugh	herr	,	who	's	a	professor	at	mit	who	lost	his	 limb 	 s 	 	in	a	 climb 	 ing 	 	accident	.
and	now	both	of	these	can	climb	better	,	move	 fast 	 er 	 	,	swim	 different 	 ly 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 prost 	 hetic 	 s 	 	than	us	normal	-	abled	 person 	 s 	 	.
now	how	about	other	 exponential 	 s 	 	?
 clear 	 ly 	 	the	 obes 	 ity 	 	trend	is	 exponential 	 ly 	 	going	in	the	wrong	direction	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	with	huge	 cost 	 s 	 	.
but	the	trend	in	medicine	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	to	get	 exponential 	 ly 	 	 small 	 er 	 	.
so	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	:	we	're	now	in	the	era	of	``	fantastic	voyage	,	``	the	ipill	.
you	can	swallow	 th 	 is 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 integrate 	 d 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
it	can	take	 picture 	 s 	 	of	your	gi	system	,	help	 diagnos 	 e 	 	and	treat	 a 	 s 	 	it	 move 	 s 	 	through	your	gi	tract	.
we	get	 in 	 to 	 	even	 small 	 er 	 	micro	-	 robot 	 s 	 	that	will	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 autonomous 	 ly 	 	move	through	your	system	 aga 	 in 	 	and	be	able	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 surgeon 	 s 	 	ca	n't	do	in	a	much	less	invasive	manner	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	these	might	self	-	assemble	in	your	gi	system	and	be	 augment 	 ed 	 	in	that	 re 	 ality 	 	.
on	the	cardiac	side	,	 pace 	 makers 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 small 	 er 	 	and	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	place	so	you	do	n't	need	to	train	an	 intervention 	 al 	 	 cardio 	 logist 	 	to	place	them	.
and	they	're	going	to	be	 wire 	 lessly 	 	 tele 	 meter 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	to	your	mobile	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	so	you	can	go	 place 	 s 	 	and	be	 monitor 	 ed 	 	 remote 	 ly 	 	.
these	are	 shrink 	 ing 	 	even	further	.
here	's	one	that	's	in	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	by	medtronic	that	's	 small 	 er 	 	than	a	 pen 	 ny 	 	.
artificial	 retina 	 s 	 	,	the	ability	to	put	these	 array 	 s 	 	on	the	back	of	the	 eye 	 ball 	 	and	allow	the	blind	to	see	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	early	 trial 	 s 	 	,	but	moving	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
these	are	going	to	be	game	changing	.
or	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	 sight 	 ed 	 	,	how	about	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 assist 	 ed 	 	-	living	contact	lens	?
bluetooth	,	wifi	 avail 	 able 	 	--	 beam 	 s 	 	back	 image 	 s 	 	to	your	eye	.
now	if	you	have	trouble	 maintain 	 ing 	 	your	diet	,	it	might	help	to	have	some	extra	 image 	 ry 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	how	 man 	 y 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	coming	at	you	.
how	about	 enabl 	 ing 	 	the	 patho 	 logist 	 	to	use	 the 	 ir 	 	cell	phone	 aga 	 in 	 	to	see	at	a	 micro 	 scopic 	 	level	and	to	lumber	that	data	back	to	the	cloud	and	make	better	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	?
in	fact	,	the	whole	era	of	 labor 	 atory 	 	medicine	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	changing	.
we	can	now	leverage	 micro 	 fluid 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	chip	made	by	steve	quake	at	stanford	.
 micro 	 fluid 	 ic 	 s 	 	can	replace	an	entire	lab	of	 technician 	 s 	 	.
put	it	on	a	chip	,	 en 	 able 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 test 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	at	the	point	of	care	,	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	leverage	technology	to	the	 r 	 ural 	 	and	the	under	-	 serv 	 ed 	 	and	 en 	 able 	 	what	used	to	be	thousand	-	dollar	 test 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	at	 penni 	 es 	 	and	at	the	point	of	care	.
if	we	go	down	the	small	 path 	 way 	 	a	little	bit	 far 	 ther 	 	,	we	're	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	era	of	 nano 	 medicine 	 	,	the	ability	to	make	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	super	small	to	the	point	where	we	can	design	red	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	or	 micro 	 robot 	 s 	 	that	will	monitor	our	blood	system	or	 immun 	 e 	 	system	,	or	even	 t 	 hose 	 	that	might	clear	out	the	 clot 	 s 	 	from	our	 arteri 	 es 	 	.
now	how	about	 exponential 	 ly 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	?
not	 some 	 thing 	 	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	think	about	in	the	era	of	medicine	,	but	hard	 dis 	 k 	 s 	 	used	to	be	3,400	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	10	 mega 	 byte 	 s 	 	--	 exponential 	 ly 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
in	 genomic 	 s 	 	now	,	the	genome	cost	about	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	the	first	one	came	out	.
we	're	now	 approach 	 ing 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	thousand	-	dollar	genome	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	next	year	to	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	hundred	-	dollar	genome	.
what	are	we	going	to	do	with	hundred	-	dollar	 genome 	 s 	 	?
and	soon	we	'll	have	 million 	 s 	 	of	these	 test 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
and	that	's	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	when	we	start	to	 crowd 	 source 	 	that	information	.
and	we	enter	the	era	of	true	 personal 	 ized 	 	medicine	--	the	right	drug	for	the	right	person	at	the	right	time	--	 in 	 stead 	 	of	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	which	is	the	same	drug	for	 every 	 body 	 	--	sort	of	 block 	 buster 	 	drug	 medic 	 ations 	 	,	 medic 	 ations 	 	which	do	n't	work	for	you	,	the	individual	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 lever 	 aging 	 	these	 approach 	 es 	 	.
and	i	'll	 al 	 so 	 	show	you	a	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	from	23andme	 aga 	 in 	 	.
my	data	 indic 	 ates 	 	that	i	've	got	about	average	risk	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	 ma 	 cular 	 	 de 	 generation 	 	,	a	kind	of	 blind 	 ness 	 	.
but	if	i	take	that	same	data	,	upload	it	to	decodeme	,	i	can	look	at	my	risk	for	 s 	 ample 	 	type	ii	diabetes	.
i	'm	at	 al 	 most 	 	twice	the	risk	for	type	ii	diabetes	.
i	might	want	to	watch	how	much	dessert	i	have	at	the	lunch	break	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
it	might	change	my	behavior	.
 lever 	 aging 	 	my	knowledge	of	my	 pharmaco 	 genomic 	 s 	 	--	how	my	 gene 	 s 	 	 modul 	 ate 	 	,	what	my	 drug 	 s 	 	do	and	what	 dose 	 s 	 	i	need	are	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	once	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	the	individual	and	the	patient	,	will	make	better	drug	 do 	 s 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 election 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	not	just	 gene 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 multi 	 ple 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	--	our	 habit 	 s 	 	,	our	 environment 	 al 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
when	was	the	last	time	your	physician	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	where	you	've	lived	?
 geo 	 medicine 	 	:	where	you	've	lived	,	what	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	,	can	 dramat 	 ically 	 	affect	your	health	.
we	can	capture	that	information	.
so	 genomic 	 s 	 	,	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	,	the	environment	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	data	 stream 	 ing 	 	at	us	 individual 	 ly 	 	and	us	,	 a 	 s 	 	poor	 physician 	 s 	 	,	how	do	we	manage	it	?
well	we	're	now	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	era	of	 system 	 s 	 	medicine	,	or	 system 	 s 	 	biology	,	where	we	can	start	to	integrate	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	information	.
and	by	looking	at	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	our	blood	of	10,000	 bio 	 marker 	 s 	 	in	a	single	test	,	we	can	start	to	look	at	these	little	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	detect	disease	at	a	much	 ear 	 lier 	 	stage	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	by	lee	hood	,	the	father	of	the	field	,	p	4	medicine	.
we	're	going	to	be	 predict 	 ive 	 	;	we	're	going	to	know	what	you	're	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	.
we	can	be	 prevent 	 ative 	 	;	that	 prevent 	 ion 	 	can	be	 personal 	 ized 	 	;	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 particip 	 atory 	 	.
through	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	like	 patient 	 s 	 	like	me	or	 man 	 aging 	 	your	data	on	 micro 	 soft 	 	healthvault	or	google	health	,	 lever 	 aging 	 	 th 	 is 	 	together	in	 particip 	 atory 	 	ways	is	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
so	i	'll	finish	up	with	 exponential 	 ly 	 	better	.
we	'd	like	to	get	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	better	and	more	effective	.
now	 to 	 day 	 	we	treat	high	blood	pressure	 most 	 ly 	 	with	 pill 	 s 	 	.
what	if	we	take	a	new	 de 	 vice 	 	and	knock	out	the	nerve	 vessel 	 s 	 	that	help	mediate	blood	pressure	and	in	a	single	therapy	to	cure	 hyper 	 tension 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	 de 	 vice 	 	that	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
it	should	be	on	the	market	 with 	 in 	 	a	year	or	two	.
how	about	more	 target 	 ed 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	for	cancer	?
right	,	i	'm	an	 onco 	 logist 	 	and	i	have	to	say	most	of	what	we	give	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	poison	.
we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	at	stanford	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	that	we	can	discover	cancer	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	seem	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	disease	 re 	 lapse 	 	.
so	if	you	think	of	cancer	 a 	 s 	 	a	weed	,	we	often	can	whack	the	weed	away	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	shrink	,	but	it	often	 come 	 s 	 	back	.
so	we	're	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	wrong	target	.
the	cancer	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	remain	,	and	the	tumor	can	return	 month 	 s 	 	or	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
we	're	now	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	identify	the	cancer	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	and	identify	 t 	 hose 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 target 	 s 	 	and	go	for	the	long	-	term	cure	.
and	we	're	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	era	of	 personal 	 ized 	 	 onco 	 logy 	 	,	the	ability	to	leverage	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	data	together	,	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	tumor	and	come	up	with	a	real	,	specific	 cock 	 tail 	 	for	the	individual	patient	.
now	i	'll	close	with	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	.
so	i	've	 stud 	 ied 	 	a	lot	about	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	--	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	adult	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	our	body	.
we	use	 t 	 hose 	 	in	my	field	of	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	 transplant 	 ation 	 	.
geron	,	just	last	year	,	 start 	 ed 	 	the	first	trial	using	human	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	to	treat	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	 inju 	 ries 	 	.
still	a	phase	i	trial	,	but	 evolv 	 ing 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	using	adult	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	now	in	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	for	about	15	 year 	 s 	 	to	approach	a	whole	range	of	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	disease	.
we	take	our	own	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	and	treat	a	patient	with	a	heart	attack	,	we	can	see	much	 improv 	 ed 	 	heart	function	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	better	 surviv 	 al 	 	using	our	own	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	drive	 cell 	 s 	 	after	a	heart	attack	.
i	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	 de 	 vice 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	marrowminer	,	a	much	less	invasive	way	for	 harvest 	 ing 	 	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	.
it	's	now	 be 	 en 	 	fda	approved	,	and	it	'll	 hope 	 fully 	 	be	on	the	market	in	the	next	year	or	so	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	you	can	appreciate	the	 de 	 vice 	 	there	 curv 	 ing 	 	through	the	patient	's	body	and	 re 	 moving 	 	the	patient	's	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	with	200	 punctu 	 re 	 s 	 	,	with	just	a	single	 punctu 	 re 	 	under	local	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	.
but	where	is	stem	cell	therapy	 re 	 ally 	 	going	?
if	you	think	about	it	,	every	cell	in	your	body	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	dna	 a 	 s 	 	you	had	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	an	embryo	.
we	can	now	 re 	 program 	 	your	skin	 cell 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	act	like	a	 pluri 	 potent 	 	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	cell	and	to	 util 	 ize 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 potential 	 ly 	 	to	treat	 multi 	 ple 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	in	that	same	patient	--	making	your	own	 personal 	 ized 	 	stem	cell	lines	.
and	i	think	they	'll	be	a	new	era	of	your	own	stem	cell	 bank 	 ing 	 	to	have	in	the	 freeze 	 r 	 	your	own	cardiac	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 myo 	 cytes 	 	and	neural	 cell 	 s 	 	to	use	them	in	the	future	,	should	you	need	them	.
and	we	're	 integ 	 rating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	now	with	a	whole	era	of	cellular	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	and	 integ 	 rating 	 	exponential	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 essential 	 ly 	 	3d	organ	 print 	 ing 	 	--	 re 	 placing 	 	the	ink	with	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 essential 	 ly 	 	building	and	 re 	 construct 	 ing 	 	a	3d	organ	.
that	's	where	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	to	head	--	still	 ver 	 y 	 	early	 day 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	exponential	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
so	in	close	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	about	technology	 trend 	 s 	 	and	how	to	impact	health	and	medicine	,	we	're	 enter 	 ing 	 	an	era	of	 miniatur 	 ization 	 	,	 de 	 central 	 ization 	 	and	 personal 	 ization 	 	.
and	i	think	by	 pull 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	together	,	if	we	can	start	to	think	about	how	to	understand	and	leverage	these	,	we	're	going	to	empower	the	patient	,	 en 	 able 	 	the	doctor	,	enhance	 well 	 ness 	 	and	begin	to	cure	the	well	before	they	get	sick	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	 a 	 s 	 	a	doctor	,	if	 some 	 one 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	me	with	stage	i	disease	,	i	'm	 thrill 	 ed 	 	--	we	can	often	cure	them	.
but	often	it	's	too	late	and	it	's	stage	iii	or	iv	cancer	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
so	by	 lever 	 aging 	 	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	together	,	i	think	we	'll	enter	a	new	era	that	i	like	to	call	stage	0	medicine	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	cancer	doctor	,	i	'm	looking	forward	to	 be 	 ing 	 	out	of	a	job	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
