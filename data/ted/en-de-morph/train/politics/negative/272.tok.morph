 philosoph 	 ers 	 	,	 dramat 	 ists 	 	,	 theo 	 log 	 ians 	 	have	 grappl 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	question	for	centuries	:	what	 make 	 s 	 	people	go	wrong	?
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	when	i	was	a	little	kid	.
when	i	was	a	kid	growing	up	in	the	south	bronx	,	inner	-	city	ghetto	in	new	york	,	i	was	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 e 	 vil 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	all	 kid 	 s 	 	are	who	grew	up	in	an	inner	city	.
and	i	had	 friend 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 kid 	 s 	 	,	who	lived	out	the	dr.	jekyll	mr.	hyde	scenario	--	robert	louis	stevenson	.
that	is	,	they	took	 drug 	 s 	 	,	got	in	trouble	,	went	to	jail	.
some	got	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	and	some	did	it	 with 	 out 	 	drug	 assist 	 ance 	 	.
so	when	i	read	robert	louis	stevenson	,	that	was	n't	fiction	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	question	is	,	what	was	in	the	juice	?
and	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	that	line	between	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	--	which	 privilege 	 d 	 	people	like	to	think	is	 fix 	 ed 	 	and	 imper 	 me 	 able 	 	,	with	them	on	the	good	side	,	and	the	 other 	 s 	 	on	the	bad	side	--	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	line	was	movable	,	and	it	was	 perm 	 e 	 able 	 	.
good	people	could	be	 seduce 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	that	line	,	and	under	good	and	some	rare	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	bad	 kid 	 s 	 	could	 re 	 cover 	 	with	help	,	with	reform	,	with	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	.
so	i	want	to	begin	with	 th 	 is 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	illusion	by	[	dutch	]	artist	m.c	.	escher	.
if	you	look	at	it	and	focus	on	the	white	,	what	you	see	is	a	world	full	of	 angel 	 s 	 	.
but	let	's	look	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	,	what	 appear 	 s 	 	is	the	 demo 	 ns 	 	,	the	 devil 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
and	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	,	the	world	is	,	was	,	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	is	the	 y 	 in 	 	and	 y 	 ang 	 	of	the	human	condition	.
it	 tell 	 s 	 	me	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.	if	you	remember	,	god	's	 favor 	 ite 	 	angel	was	lucifer	.
 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	lucifer	 mean 	 s 	 	``	the	light	.	``
it	 al 	 so 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	``	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	star	,	``	in	some	 script 	 ure 	 	.
and	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	he	 dis 	 obey 	 ed 	 	god	,	and	that	's	the	ultimate	 dis 	 obedi 	 ence 	 	to	 author 	 ity 	 	.
and	when	he	did	,	michael	,	the	 arch 	 angel 	 	,	was	 s 	 ent 	 	to	kick	him	out	of	heaven	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	other	 fall 	 en 	 	 angel 	 s 	 	.
and	so	lucifer	 descend 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	hell	,	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	satan	,	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	devil	,	and	the	force	of	 e 	 vil 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	.
 paradox 	 ically 	 	,	it	was	god	who	 create 	 d 	 	hell	 a 	 s 	 	a	place	to	store	 e 	 vil 	 	.
he	did	n't	do	a	good	job	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	it	there	 th 	 ough 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	arc	of	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	god	's	 favor 	 ite 	 	angel	 in 	 to 	 	the	devil	,	for	me	,	 set 	 s 	 	the	 con 	 text 	 	for	 understand 	 ing 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	who	are	 transform 	 ed 	 	from	good	,	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	 in 	 to 	 	 perpet 	 rator 	 s 	 	of	 e 	 vil 	 	.
so	the	lucifer	effect	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 focus 	 es 	 	on	the	 negative 	 s 	 	--	the	 negative 	 s 	 	that	people	can	 be 	 come 	 	,	not	the	 negative 	 s 	 	that	people	are	--	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	a	 psycho 	 logical 	 	definition	.	 e 	 vil 	 	is	the	 exercis 	 e 	 	of	power	.
and	that	's	the	key	:	it	's	about	power	.
to	 intentional 	 ly 	 	harm	people	 psycho 	 logically 	 	,	to	hurt	people	 physical 	 ly 	 	,	to	destroy	people	 mortal 	 ly 	 	,	or	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	to	commit	 crime 	 s 	 	against	 human 	 ity 	 	.
if	you	google	``	 e 	 vil 	 	,	``	a	word	that	should	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	have	 with 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	now	,	you	come	up	with	136	million	 hit 	 s 	 	in	a	third	of	a	second	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	i	am	 s 	 ure 	 	all	of	you	 we 	 re 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	,	with	the	 revel 	 ation 	 	of	american	 soldier 	 s 	 	 ab 	 using 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	in	a	strange	place	in	a	controversial	war	,	abu	ghraib	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	men	and	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	through	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	 humil 	 iation 	 	.
i	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	,	but	i	was	n't	 surprise 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	 s 	 een 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	same	visual	 parallel 	 s 	 	when	i	was	the	 pri 	 son 	 	 super 	 intend 	 ent 	 	of	the	stanford	 pri 	 son 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	.
 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	the	bush	 administr 	 ation 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	...	what	?
what	all	 administr 	 ations 	 	say	when	there	's	a	scandal	.
``	do	n't	blame	us	.	it	's	not	the	system	.	it	's	the	few	bad	 apple 	 s 	 	,	the	few	 r 	 ogue 	 	 soldier 	 s 	 	.	``
my	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	is	,	american	 soldier 	 s 	 	are	good	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	was	the	barrel	that	was	bad	.
but	how	am	i	going	to	--	how	am	i	going	to	deal	with	that	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	?
i	 be 	 came 	 	an	expert	witness	for	one	of	the	 guard 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 er 	 ge 	 ant 	 	chip	frederick	,	and	in	that	position	,	i	had	access	to	the	dozen	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	 report 	 s 	 	.
i	had	access	to	him	.	i	could	 stud 	 y 	 	him	,	have	him	come	to	my	home	,	get	to	know	him	,	do	 psycho 	 logical 	 	analysis	to	see	,	was	he	a	good	apple	or	bad	apple	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	i	had	access	to	all	of	the	1,000	 picture 	 s 	 	that	these	 soldier 	 s 	 	took	.
these	 picture 	 s 	 	are	of	a	violent	or	sexual	nature	.
all	of	them	come	from	the	 camera 	 s 	 	of	american	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	digital	camera	or	cell	phone	camera	,	they	took	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.	more	than	1,000	.
and	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	i	 organize 	 d 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
but	these	are	by	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	police	,	 arm 	 y 	 	 re 	 serv 	 ists 	 	.
they	are	not	 soldier 	 s 	 	prepared	for	 th 	 is 	 	mission	at	all	.
and	it	all	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	a	single	place	,	tier	1	-	a	,	on	the	night	shift	.
why	?	tier	1	-	a	was	the	center	for	 militar 	 y 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
it	was	the	 interrog 	 ation 	 	hold	.	the	cia	was	there	.
 interrog 	 ators 	 	from	titan	corporation	,	all	there	,	and	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	no	information	about	the	insurgency	.
so	they	're	going	to	put	pressure	on	these	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	 militar 	 y 	 	police	,	to	cross	the	line	,	give	them	 per 	 mission 	 	to	break	the	will	of	the	 ene 	 my 	 	,	to	 prep 	 are 	 	them	for	 interrog 	 ation 	 	,	to	 s 	 often 	 	them	up	,	to	take	the	 glove 	 s 	 	off	.	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 euphem 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	was	 interpret 	 ed 	 	.
let	's	go	down	to	that	 dung 	 eon 	 	.
so	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	 horr 	 ific 	 	.
that	's	one	of	the	visual	 illustr 	 ations 	 	of	 e 	 vil 	 	.
and	it	should	not	have	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	you	that	the	reason	i	 pair 	 ed 	 	the	prisoner	with	his	 arm 	 s 	 	out	with	leonardo	da	vinci	's	 o 	 de 	 	to	 human 	 ity 	 	is	that	that	prisoner	was	 ment 	 ally 	 	ill	.
that	prisoner	 cover 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	with	shit	every	day	,	and	they	used	to	have	to	roll	him	in	dirt	so	he	would	n't	stink	.
but	the	 guard 	 s 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 call 	 ing 	 	him	``	shit	boy	.	``
what	was	he	 do 	 ing 	 	in	that	 pri 	 son 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	in	some	mental	institution	?
in	any	event	,	here	's	 form 	 er 	 	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	defense	rumsfeld	.
he	 come 	 s 	 	down	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	want	to	know	,	who	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	?
who	are	the	bad	 apple 	 s 	 	?	``	well	,	that	's	a	bad	question	.
you	have	to	 re 	 frame 	 	it	and	ask	,	``	what	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	``	what	``	could	be	the	who	of	people	,	but	it	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	the	what	of	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	that	's	 wrong 	 headed 	 	.
so	how	do	 psycho 	 logists 	 	go	about	 understand 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 transform 	 ations 	 	of	human	character	,	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	good	 soldier 	 s 	 	before	they	went	down	to	that	 dung 	 eon 	 	?
there	are	three	ways	.	the	main	way	is	--	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 dis 	 position 	 al 	 	.
we	look	at	what	's	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	person	,	the	bad	 apple 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	all	of	social	science	,	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	war	.
social	 psycho 	 logists 	 	like	me	come	 a 	 long 	 	and	say	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	people	are	the	 act 	 ors 	 	on	the	stage	,	but	you	'll	have	to	be	aware	of	what	that	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	.
who	are	the	cast	of	 character 	 s 	 	?	what	's	the	 cost 	 ume 	 	?
is	there	a	stage	director	?	``
and	so	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	what	are	the	external	 factor 	 s 	 	around	the	individual	--	the	bad	barrel	?
and	social	 scientist 	 s 	 	stop	there	,	and	they	 mis 	 s 	 	the	big	point	that	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	when	i	 be 	 came 	 	an	expert	witness	for	abu	ghraib	.
the	power	is	in	the	system	.
the	system	 create 	 s 	 	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	 corrupt 	 s 	 	the	 individual 	 s 	 	,	and	the	system	is	the	legal	,	 politic 	 al 	 	,	economic	,	cultural	 back 	 ground 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	power	is	of	the	bad	-	barrel	makers	.
so	if	you	want	to	change	a	person	,	you	've	got	to	change	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
if	you	want	to	change	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	you	've	got	to	know	where	the	power	is	,	in	the	system	.
so	the	lucifer	effect	 involve 	 s 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	human	character	 transform 	 ations 	 	with	these	three	 factor 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	a	dynamic	 inter 	 play 	 	.
what	do	the	people	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	?
what	 do 	 es 	 	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	out	of	them	?
and	what	is	the	system	that	 create 	 s 	 	and	 maintain 	 s 	 	that	 situ 	 ation 	 	?
so	my	book	,	``	the	lucifer	effect	,	``	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	is	about	,	how	do	you	understand	how	good	people	turn	 e 	 vil 	 	?
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	detail	about	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	dr.	z	's	``	lucifer	effect	,	``	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 focus 	 es 	 	on	 e 	 vil 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	 celebr 	 ation 	 	of	the	human	mind	's	infinite	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	make	any	of	us	kind	or	cruel	,	 car 	 ing 	 	or	 in 	 different 	 	,	creative	or	 destruct 	 ive 	 	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	some	of	us	 villa 	 in 	 s 	 	.
and	the	good	news	story	that	i	'm	going	to	 hope 	 fully 	 	come	to	at	the	end	is	that	it	 make 	 s 	 	some	of	us	heroes	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	cartoon	in	the	new	yorker	,	which	 re 	 ally 	 	 summarize 	 s 	 	my	whole	talk	:	``	i	'm	 n 	 either 	 	a	good	cop	nor	a	bad	cop	,	jerome	.
like	 your 	 self 	 	,	i	'm	a	complex	 am 	 al 	 gam 	 	of	positive	and	negative	 personal 	 ity 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	that	emerge	or	not	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.	``
there	's	a	 stud 	 y 	 	some	of	you	think	you	know	about	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	have	ever	read	the	story	.	you	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	movie	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	stanley	milgram	,	little	jewish	kid	from	the	bronx	,	and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	,	``	could	the	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	happen	here	,	now	?	``
people	say	,	``	no	,	that	's	nazi	germany	,	that	's	hitler	,	you	know	,	that	's	1939	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	suppose	hitler	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	,	'	would	you	 electro 	 cute 	 	a	 strange 	 r 	 	?	'	'	no	way	,	not	me	,	i	'm	a	good	person	.	'	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	we	put	you	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	and	give	you	a	chance	to	see	what	you	would	do	?	``
and	so	what	he	did	was	he	tested	1,000	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	.
500	new	 have 	 n 	 	,	connecticut	,	500	bridgeport	.
and	the	ad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 psycho 	 logists 	 	want	to	understand	 memor 	 y 	 	.

``	we	're	going	to	give	you	five	 buck 	 s 	 	--	four	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	your	time	.	``
and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	do	n't	want	college	 student 	 s 	 	.
we	want	men	between	20	and	50.	``
in	the	 lat 	 er 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	they	ran	women	.
 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	:	 barb 	 ers 	 	,	clerks	,	white	-	collar	people	.
so	,	you	go	down	,	and	one	of	you	is	going	to	be	a	 learn 	 er 	 	,	and	one	of	you	is	going	to	be	a	teacher	.
the	 learn 	 er 	 	's	a	 gen 	 ial 	 	,	middle	-	aged	guy	.
he	 get 	 s 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	shock	apparatus	in	 an 	 other 	 	room	.
the	 learn 	 er 	 	could	be	middle	-	aged	,	could	be	 a 	 s 	 	young	 a 	 s 	 	20	.
and	one	of	you	is	told	by	the	 author 	 ity 	 	,	the	guy	in	the	lab	coat	,	``	your	job	 a 	 s 	 	teacher	is	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	guy	material	to	learn	.
 get 	 s 	 	it	right	,	reward	him	.

the	first	button	is	15	 volt 	 s 	 	.	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	feel	it	.	``
that	's	the	key	.	all	 e 	 vil 	 	 start 	 s 	 	with	15	 volt 	 s 	 	.
and	then	the	next	step	is	 an 	 other 	 	15	 volt 	 s 	 	.
the	problem	is	,	at	the	end	of	the	line	,	it	's	450	 volt 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	 a 	 long 	 	,	the	guy	is	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	've	got	a	heart	condition	!	i	'm	out	of	here	!	``
you	're	a	good	person	.	you	complain	.

 continu 	 e 	 	,	teacher	.	``
and	the	question	is	,	who	would	go	all	the	way	to	450	 volt 	 s 	 	?
you	should	notice	here	,	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	up	to	375	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	danger	.	severe	shock	.	``
when	it	 get 	 s 	 	up	to	here	,	there	's	``	xxx	``	--	the	 porn 	 ography 	 	of	power	.
so	milgram	 ask 	 s 	 	40	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	,	``	what	percent	of	american	 citizen 	 s 	 	would	go	to	the	end	?	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	percent	.	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 s 	 ad 	 istic 	 	behavior	,	and	we	know	,	 psych 	 iatry 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	one	percent	of	americans	are	 s 	 ad 	 istic 	 	.
ok	.	here	's	the	data	.	they	could	not	be	more	wrong	.
two	 third 	 s 	 	go	all	the	way	to	450	 volt 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	just	one	 stud 	 y 	 	.
milgram	did	more	than	16	 stud 	 ies 	 	.	and	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	 stud 	 y 	 	16	,	where	you	see	 some 	 body 	 	like	you	go	all	the	way	,	90	percent	go	all	the	way	.	in	 stud 	 y 	 	five	,	if	you	see	people	rebel	,	90	percent	rebel	.
what	about	women	?	 stud 	 y 	 	13	--	no	different	than	men	.
so	milgram	is	 quant 	 ifying 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	of	people	to	 blind 	 ly 	 	obey	 author 	 ity 	 	,	to	go	all	the	way	to	450	 volt 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	like	a	dial	on	human	nature	.
a	dial	in	a	sense	that	you	can	make	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 obedi 	 ent 	 	,	down	to	the	 major 	 ity 	 	,	down	to	 non 	 e 	 	.
so	what	are	the	external	 parallel 	 s 	 	?	for	all	research	is	artificial	.
what	's	the	 valid 	 ity 	 	in	the	real	world	?
912	american	 citizen 	 s 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	 su 	 icide 	 	or	 we 	 re 	 	 murder 	 ed 	 	by	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	in	guyana	jungle	in	1978	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 blind 	 ly 	 	 obedi 	 ent 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	 the 	 ir 	 	pastor	--	not	 the 	 ir 	 	priest	--	 the 	 ir 	 	pastor	,	reverend	jim	jones	.
he	 persuad 	 ed 	 	them	to	commit	mass	 su 	 icide 	 	.
and	so	,	he	's	the	modern	lucifer	effect	,	a	man	of	god	who	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	angel	of	death	.
milgram	's	 stud 	 y 	 	is	all	about	individual	 author 	 ity 	 	to	control	people	.
most	of	the	time	,	we	are	in	 institution 	 s 	 	,	so	the	stanford	 pri 	 son 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	is	a	 stud 	 y 	 	of	the	power	of	 institution 	 s 	 	to	influence	individual	behavior	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	stanley	milgram	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	same	high	school	class	in	james	monroe	in	the	bronx	,	1954	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	which	i	did	with	my	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	craig	haney	--	we	 al 	 so 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	work	with	an	ad	.
we	did	n't	have	money	,	so	we	had	a	cheap	,	little	ad	,	but	we	 want 	 ed 	 	college	 student 	 s 	 	for	a	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 pri 	 son 	 	life	.
75	people	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	,	took	 personal 	 ity 	 	 test 	 s 	 	.
we	did	 interview 	 s 	 	.	 pick 	 ed 	 	two	dozen	:	the	most	normal	,	the	most	 health 	 y 	 	.
 random 	 ly 	 	 assign 	 ed 	 	them	to	be	prisoner	and	guard	.
so	on	day	one	,	we	 k 	 new 	 	we	had	good	 apple 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	put	them	in	a	bad	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	we	know	there	's	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	 boy 	 s 	 	who	are	going	to	be	 guard 	 s 	 	and	the	 boy 	 s 	 	who	are	going	to	be	 prisoner 	 s 	 	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	 prisoner 	 s 	 	,	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	wait	at	home	in	the	 dorm 	 it 	 ories 	 	.	the	 stud 	 y 	 	will	begin	sunday	.	``
we	did	n't	tell	them	that	the	city	police	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	come	and	do	realistic	 arrest 	 s 	 	.
student	:	a	police	car	 pull 	 s 	 	up	in	front	,	and	a	cop	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	front	door	,	and	 knock 	 s 	 	,	and	 say 	 s 	 	he	's	looking	for	me	.
so	they	,	right	there	,	you	know	,	they	took	me	out	the	door	,	they	put	my	 hand 	 s 	 	against	the	car	.
it	was	a	real	cop	car	,	it	was	a	real	 police 	 man 	 	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	real	 neighbor 	 s 	 	in	the	street	,	who	did	n't	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	experiment	.
and	there	was	 camera 	 s 	 	all	around	and	 neighbor 	 s 	 	all	around	.
they	put	me	in	the	car	,	then	they	drove	me	around	palo	 al 	 to 	 	.
they	took	me	to	the	police	station	,	the	 base 	 ment 	 	of	the	police	station	.	then	they	put	me	in	a	cell	.
i	was	the	first	one	to	be	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	,	so	they	put	me	in	a	cell	,	which	was	just	like	a	room	with	a	door	with	 bar 	 s 	 	on	it	.
you	could	tell	it	was	n't	a	real	jail	.
they	 lock 	 ed 	 	me	in	there	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	little	 out 	 fit 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	taking	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	too	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
philip	zimbardo	:	here	are	the	 prisoner 	 s 	 	who	are	going	to	be	 de 	 human 	 ized 	 	.
they	're	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
here	are	the	 guard 	 s 	 	with	the	 symbol 	 s 	 	of	power	and	 anonym 	 ity 	 	.
 guard 	 s 	 	get	 prisoner 	 s 	 	to	clean	the	toilet	 bowl 	 s 	 	out	with	 the 	 ir 	 	bare	 hand 	 s 	 	,	to	do	other	 humil 	 i 	 ating 	 	 task 	 s 	 	.
they	strip	them	naked	.	they	 sexual 	 ly 	 	taunt	them	.
they	begin	to	do	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	them	 simul 	 ate 	 	 so 	 dom 	 y 	 	.
you	saw	 simul 	 ating 	 	 fell 	 atio 	 	in	 soldier 	 s 	 	in	abu	ghraib	.
my	 guard 	 s 	 	did	it	in	five	 day 	 s 	 	.	the	stress	 re 	 action 	 	was	so	 extrem 	 e 	 	that	normal	 kid 	 s 	 	we	 pick 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 health 	 y 	 	had	 break 	 down 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	36	 hour 	 s 	 	.
the	 stud 	 y 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	after	six	 day 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	out	of	control	.
five	 kid 	 s 	 	had	 emotion 	 al 	 	 break 	 down 	 s 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	it	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	if	 warrior 	 s 	 	go	to	battle	changing	 the 	 ir 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	or	not	?
 do 	 es 	 	it	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	if	they	're	 anonym 	 ous 	 	,	in	how	they	treat	 the 	 ir 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	?
we	know	in	some	 culture 	 s 	 	,	they	go	to	war	,	they	do	n't	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	.
in	other	 culture 	 s 	 	,	they	paint	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	like	``	lord	of	the	flies	.	``
in	some	,	they	wear	 mask 	 s 	 	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	,	 soldier 	 s 	 	are	 anonym 	 ous 	 	in	uniform	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	,	john	watson	,	found	23	 culture 	 s 	 	that	had	two	bits	of	data	.
do	they	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	?	15	.
do	they	kill	,	torture	,	mutilate	?	13	.
if	they	do	n't	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	eight	 kill 	 s 	 	,	 torture 	 s 	 	or	 mutilate 	 s 	 	.
the	key	is	in	the	red	zone	.
if	they	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	,	12	of	13	--	that	's	90	percent	--	kill	,	torture	,	mutilate	.
and	that	's	the	power	of	 anonym 	 ity 	 	.
so	what	are	the	seven	social	 process 	 es 	 	that	 gr 	 ease 	 	the	 slip 	 per 	 y 	 	 slop 	 e 	 	of	 e 	 vil 	 	?
 mind 	 lessly 	 	taking	the	first	small	step	.
dehumanization	of	 other 	 s 	 	.	de	-	individuation	of	self	.
diffusion	of	personal	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.	blind	 obedi 	 ence 	 	to	 author 	 ity 	 	.
uncritical	 conform 	 ity 	 	to	group	 norm 	 s 	 	.
 pass 	 ive 	 	 toler 	 ance 	 	to	 e 	 vil 	 	through	 in 	 action 	 	or	 in 	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	're	in	a	new	or	 un 	 familiar 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
your	 habitu 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	do	n't	work	.
your	 personal 	 ity 	 	and	 moral 	 ity 	 	are	 dis 	 engag 	 ed 	 	.
``	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	 eas 	 ier 	 	than	to	 den 	 ounce 	 	the	evildoer	;	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	difficult	than	 understand 	 ing 	 	him	,	``	dostoyevksy	 tell 	 s 	 	us	.
 understand 	 ing 	 	is	not	 ex 	 cus 	 ing 	 	.	 psycho 	 logy 	 	is	not	excuse	-	iology	.
so	social	and	 psycho 	 logical 	 	research	 reveal 	 s 	 	how	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	good	people	can	be	 transform 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 drug 	 s 	 	.
you	do	n't	need	it	.	you	just	need	the	social	-	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 process 	 es 	 	.
real	world	 parallel 	 s 	 	?	 compar 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
james	schlesinger	--	and	i	'm	going	to	have	to	end	with	 th 	 is 	 	--	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 psycho 	 logists 	 	have	 attempt 	 ed 	 	to	understand	how	and	why	 individual 	 s 	 	and	 group 	 s 	 	who	 usual 	 ly 	 	act	 human 	 e 	 ly 	 	can	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	act	 other 	 wise 	 	in	certain	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.	``
that	's	the	lucifer	effect	.
and	he	 go 	 es 	 	on	to	say	,	``	the	 land 	 mark 	 	stanford	 stud 	 y 	 	 provide 	 s 	 	a	 caution 	 ary 	 	tale	for	all	 militar 	 y 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	.	``
if	you	give	people	power	 with 	 out 	 	 over 	 sight 	 	,	it	's	a	prescription	for	abuse	.	they	 k 	 new 	 	that	,	and	let	that	happen	.
so	 an 	 other 	 	report	,	an	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	report	by	general	fay	,	 say 	 s 	 	the	system	is	 guilt 	 y 	 	.	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	report	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	it	was	the	environment	that	 create 	 d 	 	abu	ghraib	,	by	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	that	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	the	 occur 	 rence 	 	of	 s 	 uch 	 	abuse	,	and	the	fact	that	it	 remain 	 ed 	 	 un 	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	 high 	 er 	 	 author 	 ities 	 	for	a	long	period	of	time	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 abuse 	 s 	 	went	on	for	three	 month 	 s 	 	.	who	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	store	?
the	answer	is	 no 	 body 	 	,	and	,	i	think	,	 no 	 body 	 	on	purpose	.
he	 g 	 ave 	 	the	 guard 	 s 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	to	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 k 	 new 	 	 no 	 body 	 	was	ever	going	to	come	down	to	that	 dung 	 eon 	 	.
so	you	need	a	paradigm	shift	in	all	of	these	 area 	 s 	 	.
the	shift	is	away	from	the	medical	model	that	 focus 	 es 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	on	the	individual	.
the	shift	is	 to 	 ward 	 	a	public	health	model	that	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 al 	 	and	 system 	 ic 	 	 vector 	 s 	 	of	disease	.
 bull 	 y 	 ing 	 	is	a	disease	.	prejudice	is	a	disease	.	violence	is	a	disease	.
and	since	the	inquisition	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 problem 	 s 	 	at	the	individual	level	.	and	you	know	what	?	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
aleksandr	solzhenitsyn	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	line	between	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	 cut 	 s 	 	through	the	heart	of	every	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.	``
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	line	is	not	out	there	.
that	's	a	decision	that	you	have	to	make	.	that	's	a	personal	thing	.
so	i	want	to	end	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	on	a	positive	note	.
 hero 	 ism 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	antidote	to	 e 	 vil 	 	,	by	promoting	the	 hero 	 ic 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	our	 kid 	 s 	 	,	in	our	 education 	 al 	 	system	.
we	want	 kid 	 s 	 	to	think	,	i	'm	the	hero	in	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	right	 situ 	 ation 	 	to	come	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	i	will	act	 hero 	 ically 	 	.
my	whole	life	is	now	going	to	focus	away	from	 e 	 vil 	 	--	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	since	i	was	a	kid	--	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	heroes	.
 ban 	 ality 	 	of	 hero 	 ism 	 	is	,	it	's	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	who	do	 hero 	 ic 	 	 de 	 ed 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	 counter 	 point 	 	to	hannah	arendt	's	``	 ban 	 ality 	 	of	 e 	 vil 	 	.	``
our	 tradition 	 al 	 	 socie 	 tal 	 	heroes	are	wrong	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	the	 exception 	 s 	 	.
they	organize	 the 	 ir 	 	whole	life	around	 th 	 is 	 	.
that	's	why	we	know	 the 	 ir 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
and	our	 kid 	 s 	 	'	heroes	are	 al 	 so 	 	role	 model 	 s 	 	for	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	 super 	 natural 	 	 talent 	 s 	 	.
we	want	our	 kid 	 s 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	most	heroes	are	 every 	 day 	 	people	,	and	the	 hero 	 ic 	 	act	is	 un 	 usual 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	joe	darby	.
he	was	the	one	that	 stop 	 ped 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 abuse 	 s 	 	you	saw	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	he	saw	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	,	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	them	over	to	a	senior	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	officer	.
he	was	a	low	-	level	private	,	and	that	 stop 	 ped 	 	it	.	was	he	a	hero	?	no	.
they	had	to	put	him	in	 hid 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	 want 	 ed 	 	to	kill	him	,	and	then	his	mother	and	his	wife	.
for	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 hid 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	woman	who	 stop 	 ped 	 	the	stanford	 pri 	 son 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	.
when	i	 s 	 aid 	 	it	got	out	of	control	,	i	was	the	 pri 	 son 	 	 super 	 intend 	 ent 	 	.
i	did	n't	know	it	was	out	of	control	.	i	was	 total 	 ly 	 	 in 	 different 	 	.
she	came	down	,	saw	that	 mad 	 house 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	,	it	's	 terr 	 ible 	 	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	 prisoner 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	 guard 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 boy 	 s 	 	,	and	you	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	.	``
and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	the	 stud 	 y 	 	the	next	day	.
the	good	news	is	i	married	her	the	next	year	.
i	just	came	to	my	 sense 	 s 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
so	 situ 	 ations 	 	have	the	power	to	do	,	through	--	but	the	point	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	can	 in 	 flame 	 	the	 hostil 	 e 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	in	some	of	us	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	 perpet 	 rator 	 s 	 	of	 e 	 vil 	 	,	can	inspire	the	 hero 	 ic 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	in	 other 	 s 	 	.	it	's	the	same	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
and	you	're	on	one	side	or	the	other	.
most	people	are	 guilt 	 y 	 	of	the	 e 	 vil 	 	of	 in 	 action 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	your	mother	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	get	 involve 	 d 	 	.	mind	your	own	business	.	``
and	you	have	to	say	,	``	mama	,	 human 	 ity 	 	is	my	business	.	``
so	the	 psycho 	 logy 	 	of	 hero 	 ism 	 	is	--	we	're	going	to	end	in	a	moment	--	how	do	we	 encourag 	 e 	 	children	in	new	hero	 course 	 s 	 	,	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	with	matt	langdon	--	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	hero	 work 	 shop 	 	--	to	develop	 th 	 is 	 	 hero 	 ic 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	self	-	 label 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	am	a	hero	in	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	``	and	teach	them	 skill 	 s 	 	.
to	be	a	hero	,	you	have	to	learn	to	be	a	 de 	 vi 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 al 	 ways 	 	going	against	the	 conform 	 ity 	 	of	the	group	.
heroes	are	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	social	 action 	 s 	 	are	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.	who	act	.
the	key	to	 hero 	 ism 	 	is	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
a	:	you	've	got	to	act	when	other	people	are	 pass 	 ive 	 	.
b	:	you	have	to	act	socio	-	centrically	,	not	 ego 	 centric 	 ally 	 	.
and	i	want	to	end	with	the	story	that	some	of	you	know	,	about	wesley	autrey	,	new	york	 sub 	 way 	 	hero	.
fifty	-	year	-	old	african	-	american	construction	 work 	 er 	 	.
he	's	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	a	 sub 	 way 	 	in	new	york	.
a	white	guy	 fall 	 s 	 	on	the	 track 	 s 	 	.
the	 sub 	 way 	 	train	is	coming	.	there	's	75	people	there	.
you	know	what	?	they	freeze	.
he	's	got	a	reason	not	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	.
he	's	black	,	the	guy	's	white	,	and	he	's	got	two	little	 kid 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	he	 give 	 s 	 	his	 kid 	 s 	 	to	a	 strange 	 r 	 	,	 jump 	 s 	 	on	the	 track 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 s 	 	the	guy	between	the	 track 	 s 	 	,	lies	on	him	,	the	 sub 	 way 	 	 go 	 es 	 	over	him	.
wesley	and	the	guy	--	20	and	a	half	 inch 	 es 	 	height	.
the	train	 clear 	 ance 	 	is	21	 inch 	 es 	 	.
a	half	an	inch	would	have	taken	his	head	off	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	did	what	 any 	 one 	 	could	do	,	``	no	big	deal	to	jump	on	the	 track 	 s 	 	.
and	the	moral	 imper 	 ative 	 	is	``	i	did	what	 every 	 one 	 	should	do	.	``
and	so	one	day	,	you	will	be	in	a	new	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
take	path	one	,	you	're	going	to	be	a	 perpet 	 rator 	 	of	 e 	 vil 	 	.
 e 	 vil 	 	,	meaning	you	're	going	to	be	arthur	andersen	.
you	're	going	to	cheat	,	or	you	're	going	to	allow	 bull 	 y 	 ing 	 	.
path	two	,	you	 be 	 come 	 	 guilt 	 y 	 	of	the	 e 	 vil 	 	of	 pass 	 ive 	 	 in 	 action 	 	.
path	three	,	you	 be 	 come 	 	a	hero	.
the	point	is	,	are	we	ready	to	take	the	path	to	 celebr 	 ating 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	heroes	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	right	 situ 	 ation 	 	to	come	 a 	 long 	 	to	put	 hero 	 ic 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	 in 	 to 	 	action	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	may	 on 	 ly 	 	happen	once	in	your	life	,	and	when	you	pass	it	by	,	you	'll	 al 	 ways 	 	know	,	i	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	hero	and	i	let	it	pass	me	by	.
so	the	point	is	 think 	 ing 	 	it	and	then	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	i	want	to	thank	you	.	thank	you	.	thank	you	.
let	's	 oppos 	 e 	 	the	power	of	 e 	 vil 	 	 system 	 s 	 	at	home	and	 a 	 broad 	 	,	and	let	's	focus	on	the	positive	.
 advoc 	 ate 	 	for	respect	of	personal	dignity	,	for	justice	and	peace	,	which	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	our	 administr 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	so	much	.
