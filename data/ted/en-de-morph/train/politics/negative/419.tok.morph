i	'm	just	going	to	play	a	brief	video	clip	.
on	the	fifth	of	december	1985	,	a	bottle	of	1787	lafitte	was	 s 	 old 	 	for	105,000	 pound 	 s 	 	--	nine	 time 	 s 	 	the	previous	world	record	.
the	 buy 	 er 	 	was	kip	forbes	,	son	of	one	of	the	most	 f 	 lam 	 boy 	 ant 	 	 millionaire 	 s 	 	of	the	20th	century	.
the	original	owner	of	the	bottle	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	one	of	the	most	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	wine	 buff 	 s 	 	of	the	18th	century	.
ch√¢teau	lafitte	is	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 wine 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	the	prince	of	any	wine	 cell 	 ar 	 	.
benjamin	wallace	:	now	,	that	's	about	all	the	 video 	 tape 	 	that	 remain 	 s 	 	of	an	event	that	set	off	the	 long 	 est 	 	-	running	 myster 	 y 	 	in	the	modern	wine	world	.
and	the	 myster 	 y 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	named	 hard 	 y 	 	rodenstock	.
in	1985	,	he	 announce 	 d 	 	to	his	 friend 	 s 	 	in	the	wine	world	that	he	had	made	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	.
some	 work 	 men 	 	in	paris	had	broken	through	a	brick	wall	,	and	 happen 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	cache	of	 wine 	 s 	 	--	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	the	 proper 	 ty 	 	of	thomas	jefferson	.	1787	,	1784	.
he	would	n't	reveal	the	exact	number	of	 bottle 	 s 	 	,	he	would	not	reveal	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	the	building	was	and	he	would	not	reveal	 exact 	 ly 	 	who	owned	the	building	.
the	 myster 	 y 	 	 persist 	 ed 	 	for	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	 final 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	get	resolved	in	2005	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
bill	koch	is	a	florida	 billion 	 aire 	 	who	 own 	 s 	 	four	of	the	jefferson	 bottle 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 be 	 came 	 	suspicious	.
and	he	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	over	a	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	 hir 	 ing 	 	ex	-	fbi	and	ex	-	scotland	yard	 agent 	 s 	 	to	try	to	get	to	the	bottom	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	's	now	ample	evidence	that	 hard 	 y 	 	rodenstock	is	a	con	man	,	and	that	the	jefferson	 bottle 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 fake 	 s 	 	.
but	for	 t 	 hose 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	an	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	number	of	 re 	 ally 	 	eminent	and	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	in	the	wine	world	 we 	 re 	 	sort	of	drawn	 in 	 to 	 	the	orbit	of	these	 bottle 	 s 	 	.
i	think	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	most	expensive	bottle	of	wine	in	the	world	must	be	the	best	bottle	of	wine	in	the	world	,	must	be	the	 ra 	 rest 	 	bottle	of	wine	in	the	world	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	kind	of	 voyeur 	 istically 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	question	of	you	know	,	why	do	people	 s 	 pend 	 	these	crazy	 amount 	 s 	 	of	money	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	on	wine	but	on	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	are	they	living	a	better	life	than	me	?
so	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	embark	on	a	quest	.
with	the	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	 back 	 ing 	 	of	a	magazine	i	write	for	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 ample 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	,	or	most	expensive	,	or	most	 cove 	 ted 	 	item	in	about	a	dozen	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	which	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 gr 	 uel 	 ing 	 	quest	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	one	.
a	lot	of	the	kobe	beef	that	you	see	in	the	u.s.	is	not	the	real	thing	.
it	may	come	from	wagyu	cattle	,	but	it	's	not	from	the	original	,	appalachian	hyogo	prefecture	in	japan	.
there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	where	you	can	try	real	kobe	,	and	one	of	them	is	wolfgang	puck	's	restaurant	,	cut	,	in	los	angeles	.
i	went	there	,	and	i	 order 	 ed 	 	the	eight	-	ounce	rib	eye	for	160	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	was	 tin 	 y 	 	.
and	i	was	 out 	 rag 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	like	,	160	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	then	i	took	a	bite	,	and	i	 wish 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	 tin 	 ier 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	kobe	beef	is	so	rich	.
it	's	like	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	--	it	's	not	even	like	steak	.
i	 al 	 most 	 	could	n't	finish	it	.
i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	when	i	was	 d 	 one 	 	.
now	,	the	 photograph 	 er 	 	who	took	the	 picture 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	project	for	some	reason	posed	his	dog	in	a	lot	of	them	,	so	that	's	why	you	're	going	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	 recur 	 ring 	 	character	.
which	,	i	guess	,	you	know	,	 communicate 	 s 	 	to	you	that	i	did	not	think	that	one	was	 re 	 ally 	 	worth	the	price	.
white	 truffle 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	most	expensive	 luxur 	 y 	 	 food 	 s 	 	by	weight	in	the	world	.
to	try	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	went	to	a	mario	batali	restaurant	in	manhattan	--	del	posto	.
the	 wait 	 er 	 	,	you	know	,	came	out	with	the	white	truffle	knob	and	his	 sha 	 ver 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 have 	 d 	 	it	onto	my	 past 	 a 	 	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	``	would	signore	like	the	 truffle 	 s 	 	?	``
and	the	charm	of	white	 truffle 	 s 	 	is	in	 the 	 ir 	 	aroma	.
it	's	not	in	 the 	 ir 	 	taste	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.	it	's	not	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 text 	 ure 	 	.
it	's	in	the	smell	.

10	 second 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	and	it	was	gone	.
and	then	i	was	left	with	these	little	 ug 	 ly 	 	 flake 	 s 	 	on	my	 past 	 a 	 	that	,	you	know	,	 the 	 ir 	 	purpose	had	 be 	 en 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	,	and	so	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	to	say	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	 disappoint 	 ment 	 	to	me	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	--	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	these	 item 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 disappoint 	 ments 	 	.

the	magazine	would	n't	pay	for	me	to	go	there	.
they	did	give	me	a	tour	,	 th 	 ough 	 	.

it	 come 	 s 	 	with	 it 	 s 	 	own	wine	 cell 	 ar 	 	that	you	can	draw	 free 	 ly 	 	from	.
when	i	took	the	tour	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 include 	 d 	 	some	opus	one	,	i	was	glad	to	see	.

but	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 compliment 	 ed 	 	me	on	the	 jean 	 s 	 	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	.
these	 one 	 s 	 	gq	did	spring	for	--	i	own	these	--	but	i	will	tell	you	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	i	not	get	a	compliment	from	any	of	you	,	i	have	not	gotten	a	compliment	from	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	 month 	 s 	 	that	i	have	owned	and	worn	these	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	a	coffee	made	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	process	.

that	's	right	.

there	was	one	object	that	i	could	not	get	my	 hand 	 s 	 	on	,	and	that	was	the	1947	cheval	blanc	.
the	'47	cheval	blanc	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 mytho 	 log 	 ized 	 	wine	of	the	20th	century	.
and	cheval	blanc	is	kind	of	an	 un 	 usual 	 	wine	for	bordeaux	in	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	significant	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	cabernet	franc	grape	.

what	there	is	of	it	left	you	do	n't	know	if	it	's	real	--	it	's	 consider 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	most	 fak 	 ed 	 	wine	in	the	world	.

i	'd	put	out	 feel 	 ers 	 	to	 re 	 tail 	 ers 	 	,	to	 auction 	 e 	 ers 	 	,	and	it	was	coming	up	empty	.
and	then	i	got	an	email	from	a	guy	named	bipin	desai	.
bipin	desai	is	a	u.c	.	 river 	 side 	 	 theoretic 	 al 	 	physicist	who	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	the	 pre 	 eminent 	 	 organize 	 r 	 	of	rare	wine	 tasting 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	got	a	tasting	coming	up	where	we	're	going	to	serve	the	'47	cheval	blanc	.	``
and	it	was	going	to	be	a	double	 vert 	 ical 	 	--	it	was	going	to	be	30	 vintage 	 s 	 	of	cheval	blanc	,	and	30	 vintage 	 s 	 	of	yquem	.
and	it	was	an	 invit 	 ation 	 	you	do	not	 re 	 fuse 	 	.
i	went	.
it	was	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	four	 meal 	 s 	 	.
and	at	lunch	on	saturday	,	we	 open 	 ed 	 	the	'47	.
and	you	know	,	it	had	 th 	 is 	 	 fragr 	 ant 	 	 soft 	 ness 	 	,	and	it	 smell 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	of	 lin 	 seed 	 	oil	.
and	then	i	 taste 	 d 	 	it	,	and	it	,	you	know	,	had	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 un 	 ctu 	 ous 	 	,	 port 	 y 	 	 rich 	 ness 	 	,	which	is	 character 	 istic 	 	of	that	wine	--	that	it	sort	of	 resemble 	 s 	 	port	in	a	lot	of	ways	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	people	at	my	table	who	thought	it	was	,	you	know	,	fantastic	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	some	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	a	little	less	 impress 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	was	n't	that	 impress 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	--	call	my	 pal 	 ate 	 	a	 phil 	 ist 	 ine 	 	 pal 	 ate 	 	--	so	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	mean	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	was	n't	 impress 	 ed 	 	,	but	i	was	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	there	who	had	that	 re 	 action 	 	.
and	it	was	n't	just	to	that	wine	.
any	one	of	the	 wine 	 s 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	tasting	,	if	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	it	at	a	 d 	 inner 	 	party	,	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	,	you	know	,	the	wine	experience	of	my	 life 	 time 	 	,	and	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 memor 	 able 	 	.
but	 drink 	 ing 	 	60	great	 wine 	 s 	 	over	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	they	all	just	 blur 	 red 	 	together	,	and	it	 be 	 came 	 	 al 	 most 	 	a	 gr 	 uel 	 ing 	 	experience	.
and	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	finish	by	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	which	came	out	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	from	some	 research 	 ers 	 	at	stanford	and	caltech	.
and	they	 g 	 ave 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	the	same	wine	,	 label 	 ed 	 	with	different	price	 tag 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	people	,	you	know	,	 s 	 aid 	 	that	they	 like 	 d 	 	the	more	expensive	wine	more	--	it	was	the	same	wine	,	but	they	thought	it	was	a	different	one	that	was	more	expensive	.
but	what	was	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	was	that	these	 research 	 ers 	 	did	mri	brain	 im 	 aging 	 	while	the	people	 we 	 re 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	the	wine	,	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	they	say	they	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	the	more	 expensive 	 ly 	 	 label 	 ed 	 	wine	more	--	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 actual 	 ly 	 	 register 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	more	pleasure	from	the	same	wine	when	it	was	 label 	 ed 	 	with	a	 high 	 er 	 	price	tag	.
thank	you	.
