i	have	 give 	 n 	 	the	slide	show	that	i	 g 	 ave 	 	here	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	about	2,000	 time 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	giving	a	short	slide	show	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	that	i	'm	giving	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	,	so	--	well	it	's	--	i	do	n't	want	or	need	to	raise	the	bar	,	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	lower	the	bar	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 cobble 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	together	to	try	to	meet	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	session	.
and	i	was	 re 	 minded 	 	by	karen	armstrong	's	fantastic	 present 	 ation 	 	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	is	not	about	belief	,	but	about	behavior	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	should	say	the	same	thing	about	 optim 	 ism 	 	.
how	 da 	 re 	 	we	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	?
 optim 	 ism 	 	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 character 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	belief	,	an	intellectual	 post 	 ure 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	mahatma	gandhi	 famous 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	must	 be 	 come 	 	the	change	you	wish	to	see	in	the	world	.	``
and	the	 out 	 come 	 	about	which	we	wish	to	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	is	not	going	to	be	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	belief	 al 	 one 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	that	the	belief	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	about	new	behavior	.	but	the	word	``	behavior	``	is	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	think	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
i	'm	a	big	 advoc 	 ate 	 	of	changing	the	 light 	 bulb 	 s 	 	and	 buy 	 ing 	 	 hybrid 	 s 	 	,	and	tipper	and	i	put	33	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	on	our	house	,	and	 d 	 ug 	 	the	 geo 	 thermal 	 	 well 	 s 	 	,	and	did	all	of	that	other	stuff	.
but	,	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	to	change	the	 light 	 bulb 	 s 	 	,	it	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	to	change	the	 law 	 s 	 	.
and	when	we	change	our	behavior	in	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	we	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	out	the	 citizen 	 ship 	 	part	and	the	 demo 	 cracy 	 	part	.	in	order	to	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	have	to	 be 	 come 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	active	 a 	 s 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	in	our	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
in	order	to	solve	the	climate	crisis	,	we	have	to	solve	the	 demo 	 cracy 	 	crisis	.
and	we	have	one	.
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	story	for	a	long	time	.
i	was	 re 	 minded 	 	of	that	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	by	a	woman	who	 walk 	 ed 	 	past	the	table	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	,	just	 star 	 ing 	 	at	me	 a 	 s 	 	she	 walk 	 ed 	 	past	.	she	was	in	her	70s	,	 look 	 ed 	 	like	she	had	a	kind	face	.	i	thought	 noth 	 ing 	 	of	it	 un 	 til 	 	i	saw	from	the	corner	of	my	eye	she	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	from	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	direction	,	 al 	 so 	 	just	 star 	 ing 	 	at	me	.	and	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	do	you	do	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	if	you	 dy 	 ed 	 	your	hair	black	,	you	would	look	just	like	al	gore	.	``
 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	was	a	young	 congress 	 man 	 	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	an	awful	lot	of	time	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	nuclear	 arm 	 s 	 	control	--	the	nuclear	 arm 	 s 	 	race	.
and	the	 militar 	 y 	 	 historian 	 s 	 	taught	me	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	quest	,	that	 militar 	 y 	 	 conflict 	 s 	 	are	 typical 	 ly 	 	put	 in 	 to 	 	three	 categor 	 ies 	 	:	local	 battle 	 s 	 	,	 region 	 al 	 	or	theater	 war 	 s 	 	,	and	the	rare	but	all	-	 import 	 ant 	 	global	,	world	war	--	 strat 	 egic 	 	 conflict 	 s 	 	.
and	each	level	of	conflict	 requir 	 es 	 	a	different	 al 	 location 	 	of	 resource 	 s 	 	,	a	different	approach	,	a	different	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	model	.
 environment 	 al 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	fall	 in 	 to 	 	the	same	three	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	and	most	of	what	we	think	about	are	local	 environment 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	:	air	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	water	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	 hazard 	 ous 	 	waste	 dump 	 s 	 	.	but	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 region 	 al 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	like	acid	rain	from	the	 mid 	 west 	 	to	the	 north 	 east 	 	,	and	from	western	europe	to	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	and	from	the	 mid 	 west 	 	out	the	mississippi	 in 	 to 	 	the	dead	zone	of	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	.
and	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.	but	the	climate	crisis	is	the	rare	but	all	-	 import 	 ant 	 	global	,	or	 strat 	 egic 	 	,	conflict	.
 every 	 thing 	 	is	 affect 	 ed 	 	.	and	we	have	to	organize	our	 respons 	 e 	 	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	.	we	need	a	 world 	 wide 	 	,	global	 mobil 	 ization 	 	for	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	,	 conserv 	 ation 	 	,	efficiency	and	a	global	 transit 	 ion 	 	to	a	low	-	carbon	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
we	have	work	to	do	.	and	we	can	mobilize	 resource 	 s 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	will	.	but	the	 politic 	 al 	 	will	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 mobilize 	 d 	 	,	in	order	to	mobilize	the	 resource 	 s 	 	.
let	me	show	you	these	 slide 	 s 	 	here	.

the	extra	amount	that	 disappear 	 ed 	 	last	fall	was	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	much	.	it	 come 	 s 	 	back	in	the	winter	,	but	not	 a 	 s 	 	permanent	ice	,	 a 	 s 	 	thin	ice	--	 vulner 	 able 	 	.	the	amount	 remain 	 ing 	 	could	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	gone	in	summer	in	 a 	 s 	 	little	 a 	 s 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	.

what	we	need	is	 an 	 other 	 	hero	generation	.	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	 al 	 ive 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	 to 	 day 	 	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	rest	of	the	world	,	have	to	 some 	 how 	 	understand	that	 histo 	 ry 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	us	with	a	choice	--	just	 a 	 s 	 	jill	[	bolte	]	taylor	was	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	 s 	 ave 	 	her	life	while	she	was	 distract 	 ed 	 	by	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	experience	that	she	was	going	through	.
we	now	have	a	culture	of	 distract 	 ion 	 	.
but	we	have	a	planetary	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	.
and	we	have	to	find	a	way	to	create	,	in	the	generation	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	a	sense	of	 generation 	 al 	 	mission	.
i	wish	i	could	find	the	 word 	 s 	 	to	convey	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 an 	 other 	 	hero	generation	that	 br 	 ought 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	to	the	planet	.
 an 	 other 	 	that	 end 	 ed 	 	 slave 	 ry 	 	.	and	that	 g 	 ave 	 	women	the	right	to	vote	.
we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	do	n't	tell	me	that	we	do	n't	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	do	it	.
if	we	had	just	one	week	's	worth	of	what	we	 s 	 pend 	 	on	the	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	,	we	could	be	well	on	the	way	to	solving	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
we	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	do	it	.
one	final	point	:	i	'm	 optimist 	 ic 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	at	 moment 	 s 	 	of	great	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	to	set	 a 	 side 	 	the	 cause 	 s 	 	of	 distract 	 ion 	 	and	rise	to	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	 present 	 ing 	 	to	us	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	hear	people	respond	to	the	 disturb 	 ing 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	of	the	climate	crisis	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
what	a	burden	we	have	.	``	i	would	like	to	ask	you	to	 re 	 frame 	 	that	.	how	 man 	 y 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	in	all	of	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	have	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	rise	to	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	is	worthy	of	our	best	 effort 	 s 	 	?
a	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	can	pull	from	us	more	than	we	 k 	 new 	 	we	could	do	?	i	think	we	ought	to	approach	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	with	a	sense	of	 pro 	 found 	 	joy	and	 grat 	 itude 	 	that	we	are	the	generation	about	which	,	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	 phil 	 harmon 	 ic 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	and	 poet 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	will	 celebr 	 ate 	 	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	found	it	 with 	 in 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	crisis	and	lay	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	a	bright	and	 optimist 	 ic 	 	human	future	.
let	's	do	that	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	at	ted	,	there	is	deep	pain	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	design	issue	on	a	 vot 	 ing 	 	form	--	one	bad	design	issue	 me 	 ant 	 	that	your	voice	was	n't	 be 	 ing 	 	heard	like	that	in	the	last	eight	 year 	 s 	 	in	a	position	where	you	could	make	these	 thing 	 s 	 	come	true	.
that	 hurt 	 s 	 	.
al	gore	:	you	have	no	idea	.
ca	:	when	you	look	at	what	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 candid 	 ates 	 	in	your	own	party	are	 do 	 ing 	 	now	--	i	mean	,	there	's	--	are	you	 excit 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	on	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	?
ag	:	the	answer	to	the	question	is	hard	for	me	 be 	 cause 	 	,	on	the	one	hand	,	i	think	that	we	should	feel	 re 	 ally 	 	great	about	the	fact	that	the	republican	nominee	--	certain	nominee	--	john	mccain	,	and	both	of	the	 final 	 ists 	 	for	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 nomi 	 nation 	 	--	all	three	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	and	forward	-	 lean 	 ing 	 	position	on	the	climate	crisis	.	all	three	have	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	and	all	three	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	the	approach	taken	by	the	current	 administr 	 ation 	 	.	and	i	think	that	all	three	have	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	in	 put 	 ting 	 	forward	 plan 	 s 	 	and	 proposal 	 s 	 	.	but	the	campaign	 dial 	 ogue 	 	that	--	 a 	 s 	 	 illustr 	 ated 	 	by	the	 question 	 s 	 	--	that	was	put	together	by	the	league	of	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 vot 	 ers 	 	,	by	the	way	,	the	analysis	of	all	the	 question 	 s 	 	--	and	,	by	the	way	,	the	 debate 	 s 	 	have	all	 be 	 en 	 	 sponsor 	 ed 	 	by	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	by	the	orwellian	label	,	``	clean	coal	.	``	 ha 	 s 	 	 any 	 body 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	that	?
every	single	debate	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 sponsor 	 ed 	 	by	``	clean	coal	.	``
``	now	,	even	lower	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	!	``
the	 rich 	 ness 	 	and	 full 	 ness 	 	of	the	 dial 	 ogue 	 	in	our	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	laid	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	the	kind	of	bold	 initi 	 ative 	 	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	.
so	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	the	right	 thing 	 s 	 	and	they	may	--	 which 	 ever 	 	of	them	is	 elect 	 ed 	 	--	may	do	the	right	thing	,	but	let	me	tell	you	:	when	i	came	back	from	kyoto	in	1997	,	with	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	great	happiness	that	we	'd	gotten	that	 break 	 through 	 	there	,	and	then	 confront 	 ed 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	senate	,	 on 	 ly 	 	one	out	of	100	 senator 	 s 	 	was	 will 	 ing 	 	to	vote	to	confirm	,	to	 rat 	 ify 	 	that	 treat 	 y 	 	.	 what 	 ever 	 	the	 candid 	 ates 	 	say	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	laid	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	what	the	people	say	.
 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	part	of	the	fabric	of	our	whole	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
co	2	is	the	 exhal 	 ing 	 	breath	of	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
and	now	we	 mechan 	 ized 	 	that	process	.	changing	that	pattern	 requir 	 es 	 	a	scope	,	a	scale	,	a	speed	of	change	that	is	beyond	what	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	past	.
so	that	's	why	i	 beg 	 an 	 	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	in	what	you	do	,	but	be	an	active	citizen	.
demand	--	change	the	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	,	but	change	the	 law 	 s 	 	.	change	the	global	 treat 	 ies 	 	.
we	have	to	speak	up	.	we	have	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	--	we	have	sclerosis	in	our	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.	and	we	have	to	change	that	.
use	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.	go	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
connect	with	people	.	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	active	 a 	 s 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
have	a	moratorium	--	we	should	n't	have	any	new	coal	-	 fire 	 d 	 	generating	 plant 	 s 	 	that	are	n't	able	to	capture	and	store	co	2	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	we	have	to	 quick 	 ly 	 	build	these	 renew 	 able 	 	 source 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 no 	 body 	 	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	on	that	scale	.	but	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	between	now	and	november	,	it	is	possible	.
 th 	 is 	 	alliance	for	climate	 protect 	 ion 	 	is	going	to	launch	a	 nation 	 wide 	 	campaign	--	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	 mobil 	 ization 	 	,	 tele 	 vision 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	,	 inter 	 net 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	,	radio	,	 news 	 paper 	 	--	with	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	with	 every 	 body 	 	from	the	girl	 scout 	 s 	 	to	the	 hunter 	 s 	 	and	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	.
we	need	help	.	we	need	help	.
ca	:	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	your	own	personal	role	going	forward	,	al	,	is	there	 some 	 thing 	 	more	than	that	you	would	like	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	?
ag	:	i	have	 pray 	 ed 	 	that	i	would	be	able	to	find	the	answer	to	that	question	.	what	can	i	do	?
buckminster	 full 	 er 	 	once	wrote	,	``	if	the	future	of	all	human	 civil 	 ization 	 	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	me	,	what	would	i	do	?
how	would	i	be	?	``	it	 do 	 es 	 	depend	on	all	of	us	,	but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	not	just	with	the	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
we	,	most	of	us	here	,	are	americans	.	we	have	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
we	can	change	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	we	have	to	 active 	 ly 	 	change	.
what	's	 need 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	 high 	 er 	 	level	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
and	that	's	hard	to	--	that	's	hard	to	create	--	but	it	is	coming	.
there	's	an	old	african	 pro 	 verb 	 	that	some	of	you	know	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	if	you	want	to	go	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	go	 al 	 one 	 	;	if	you	want	to	go	far	,	go	together	.	``	we	have	to	go	far	,	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	we	have	to	have	a	change	in	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
a	change	in	 commit 	 ment 	 	.	a	new	sense	of	 urge 	 ncy 	 	.
a	new	 appreci 	 ation 	 	for	the	privilege	that	we	have	of	 under 	 taking 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
ca	:	al	gore	,	thank	you	so	much	for	coming	to	ted	.
ag	:	thank	you	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
