i	'm	going	to	start	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	hand	-	lettered	sign	that	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	a	mom	and	pop	 bake 	 ry 	 	in	my	old	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	in	brooklyn	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	store	owned	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	that	can	print	on	 plate 	 s 	 	of	sugar	.
and	 kid 	 s 	 	could	 br 	 ing 	 	in	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	have	the	store	print	a	sugar	plate	for	the	top	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 birth 	 day 	 	cake	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 like 	 d 	 	to	draw	was	cartoon	 character 	 s 	 	.
they	 like 	 d 	 	to	draw	the	little	 mer 	 maid 	 	,	they	'd	like	to	draw	a	 s 	 mu 	 rf 	 	,	they	'd	like	to	draw	micky	mouse	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 il 	 legal 	 	to	print	a	child	's	 draw 	 ing 	 	of	micky	mouse	onto	a	plate	of	sugar	.
and	it	's	a	 copy 	 right 	 	 viol 	 ation 	 	.
and	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	 copy 	 right 	 	 viol 	 ations 	 	for	children	's	 birth 	 day 	 	 cake 	 s 	 	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	hassle	that	the	college	 bake 	 ry 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	,	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	that	business	.
if	you	're	an	amateur	,	you	do	n't	have	access	to	our	machine	 any 	 more 	 	.
if	you	want	a	 print 	 ed 	 	sugar	 birth 	 day 	 	cake	,	you	have	to	use	one	of	our	 pre 	 fab 	 	 image 	 s 	 	--	 on 	 ly 	 	for	 professional 	 s 	 	.	``
so	there	's	two	 bill 	 s 	 	in	congress	right	now	.
one	is	 call 	 ed 	 	sopa	,	the	other	is	 call 	 ed 	 	pipa	.
sopa	 stand 	 s 	 	for	the	stop	 on 	 line 	 	 pi 	 racy 	 	act	.
it	's	from	the	senate	.
pipa	is	short	for	protectip	,	which	is	 it 	 self 	 	short	for	 prevent 	 ing 	 	real	 on 	 line 	 	 threat 	 s 	 	to	economic	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 t 	 heft 	 	of	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 congress 	 ional 	 	 aid 	 es 	 	who	name	these	 thing 	 s 	 	have	a	lot	of	time	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	what	sopa	and	pipa	want	to	do	is	they	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	want	to	raise	the	cost	of	 copy 	 right 	 	compliance	to	the	point	where	people	 simpl 	 y 	 	get	out	of	the	business	of	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cap 	 ability 	 	to	 amateur 	 s 	 	.
now	the	way	they	 pro 	 pose 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	identify	 s 	 ites 	 	that	are	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	 inf 	 ring 	 ing 	 	on	 copy 	 right 	 	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	are	identified	is	never	fully	 spec 	 ified 	 	in	the	 bill 	 s 	 	--	and	then	they	want	to	 re 	 move 	 	them	from	the	domain	name	system	.
they	want	to	take	them	out	of	the	domain	name	system	.
now	the	domain	name	system	is	the	thing	that	 turn 	 s 	 	human	-	 read 	 able 	 	 name 	 s 	 	,	like	google.com	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 address 	 es 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	expect	--	74.125.226.212	.
now	the	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	model	of	 censor 	 ship 	 	,	of	 identify 	 ing 	 	a	 s 	 ite 	 	and	then	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 move 	 	it	from	the	domain	name	system	,	is	that	it	wo	n't	work	.
and	you	'd	think	that	would	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	problem	for	a	law	,	but	congress	 seem 	 s 	 	not	to	have	let	that	 both 	 er 	 	them	too	much	.
now	the	reason	it	wo	n't	work	is	that	you	can	still	type	74.125.226.212	 in 	 to 	 	the	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	or	you	can	make	it	a	 click 	 able 	 	link	and	you	'll	still	go	to	google	.
so	the	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	layer	around	the	problem	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	real	threat	of	the	act	.
now	to	understand	how	congress	came	to	write	a	bill	that	wo	n't	accomplish	 it 	 s 	 	 state 	 d 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	,	but	will	produce	a	lot	of	 per 	 nic 	 ious 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	understand	a	little	bit	about	the	back	story	.
and	the	back	story	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	sopa	and	pipa	,	 a 	 s 	 	 legisl 	 ation 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 draft 	 ed 	 	 large 	 ly 	 	by	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 found 	 ed 	 	in	the	20th	century	.
the	20th	century	was	a	great	time	to	be	a	media	company	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	thing	you	 re 	 ally 	 	had	on	your	side	was	 scar 	 city 	 	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	making	a	tv	show	,	it	did	n't	have	to	be	better	than	all	other	tv	 show 	 s 	 	ever	made	;	it	 on 	 ly 	 	had	to	be	better	than	the	two	other	 show 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	on	at	the	same	time	--	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	threshold	of	competitive	 difficult 	 y 	 	.
which	 me 	 ant 	 	that	if	you	 field 	 ed 	 	average	content	,	you	got	a	third	of	the	u.s.	public	for	free	--	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 user 	 s 	 	for	 simpl 	 y 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	n't	too	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 licens 	 e 	 	to	print	money	and	a	barrel	of	free	ink	.
but	technology	 move 	 d 	 	on	,	 a 	 s 	 	technology	is	 won 	 t 	 	to	do	.
and	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	at	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	that	 scar 	 city 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	 erode 	 d 	 	--	and	i	do	n't	mean	by	digital	technology	;	i	mean	by	analog	technology	.
cassette	 tape 	 s 	 	,	video	cassette	 record 	 ers 	 	,	even	the	humble	xerox	machine	 create 	 d 	 	new	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	us	to	 behav 	 e 	 	in	ways	that	 astonish 	 ed 	 	the	media	business	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	we	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	couch	 potato 	 es 	 	.
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	like	to	 on 	 ly 	 	 consum 	 e 	 	.
we	do	like	to	 consum 	 e 	 	,	but	every	time	one	of	these	new	 tool 	 s 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	we	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	produce	and	we	like	to	share	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 freak 	 ed 	 	the	media	 business 	 es 	 	out	--	it	 freak 	 ed 	 	them	out	every	time	.
jack	valenti	,	who	was	the	head	 lobby 	 ist 	 	for	the	motion	picture	 associ 	 ation 	 	of	america	,	once	 like 	 ned 	 	the	ferocious	video	cassette	 record 	 er 	 	to	jack	the	ripper	and	poor	,	 help 	 less 	 	hollywood	to	a	woman	at	home	 al 	 one 	 	.
that	was	the	level	of	rhetoric	.
and	so	the	media	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	 beg 	 ged 	 	,	 insist 	 ed 	 	,	 demand 	 ed 	 	that	congress	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	congress	did	 some 	 thing 	 	.
by	the	early	90s	,	congress	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	law	that	 change 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	that	law	was	 call 	 ed 	 	the	audio	home	 record 	 ing 	 	act	of	1992	.
what	the	audio	home	 record 	 ing 	 	act	of	1992	 s 	 aid 	 	was	,	look	,	if	people	are	 tap 	 ing 	 	stuff	off	the	radio	and	then	making	 mix 	 tape 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	that	is	not	a	crime	.	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
 tap 	 ing 	 	and	 remix 	 ing 	 	and	sharing	with	your	 friend 	 s 	 	is	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
if	you	make	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	high	quality	copies	and	you	sell	them	,	that	's	not	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 tap 	 ing 	 	business	,	fine	,	let	it	go	.
and	they	thought	that	they	 clar 	 ified 	 	the	issue	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	'd	set	out	a	clear	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	legal	and	 il 	 legal 	 	 copy 	 ing 	 	.
but	that	was	n't	what	the	media	 business 	 es 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	.
they	had	 want 	 ed 	 	congress	to	 out 	 law 	 	 copy 	 ing 	 	full	-	stop	.
so	when	the	audio	home	 record 	 ing 	 	act	of	1992	was	 pass 	 ed 	 	,	the	media	 business 	 es 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	up	on	the	idea	of	legal	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	 distinct 	 ions 	 	for	 copy 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	clear	that	if	congress	was	 act 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	,	they	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 right 	 s 	 	of	 citizen 	 s 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	our	own	media	environment	.
so	they	went	for	plan	b	.
it	took	them	a	while	to	 form 	 ulate 	 	plan	b	.
plan	b	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	first	full	-	blown	form	in	1998	--	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	digital	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 copy 	 right 	 	act	.
it	was	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	piece	of	 legisl 	 ation 	 	,	a	lot	of	moving	 part 	 s 	 	.
but	the	main	thrust	of	the	dmca	was	that	it	was	legal	to	sell	you	 un 	 copy 	 able 	 	digital	material	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 un 	 copy 	 able 	 	digital	material	.
it	would	be	,	 a 	 s 	 	ed	felton	once	 famous 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	like	 hand 	 ing 	 	out	water	that	was	n't	wet	.	``
bits	are	 copy 	 able 	 	.	that	's	what	 computer 	 s 	 	do	.
that	is	a	side	effect	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	operation	.
so	in	order	to	fake	the	ability	to	sell	 un 	 copy 	 able 	 	bits	,	the	dmca	 al 	 so 	 	made	it	legal	to	force	you	to	use	 system 	 s 	 	that	broke	the	 copy 	 ing 	 	function	of	your	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
every	dvd	player	and	game	player	and	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	computer	you	 br 	 ought 	 	home	--	no	matter	what	you	thought	you	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	when	you	 b 	 ought 	 	it	--	could	be	broken	by	the	content	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	,	if	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	set	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	condition	of	selling	you	the	content	.
and	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	you	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	,	or	did	n't	enact	 the 	 ir 	 	 cap 	 abilities 	 	 a 	 s 	 	general	purpose	computing	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	made	it	 il 	 legal 	 	for	you	to	try	to	 re 	 set 	 	the	 copy 	 ability 	 	of	that	content	.
the	dmca	 mark 	 s 	 	the	moment	when	the	media	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	up	on	the	legal	system	of	 distinguish 	 ing 	 	between	legal	and	 il 	 legal 	 	 copy 	 ing 	 	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	prevent	 copy 	 ing 	 	through	technical	 mean 	 s 	 	.
now	the	dmca	had	,	and	is	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	have	,	a	lot	of	 complic 	 ated 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	,	but	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	domain	,	 limit 	 ing 	 	sharing	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	not	 work 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	main	reason	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 work 	 ed 	 	is	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	far	more	popular	and	far	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	 any 	 one 	 	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
the	 mix 	 tape 	 	,	the	 fan 	 z 	 ine 	 	,	that	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	now	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
we	are	in	a	world	where	most	american	 citizen 	 s 	 	over	the	age	of	12	share	 thing 	 s 	 	with	each	other	 on 	 line 	 	.
we	share	written	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	share	 image 	 s 	 	,	we	share	audio	,	we	share	video	.
some	of	the	stuff	we	share	is	stuff	we	've	made	.
some	of	the	stuff	we	share	is	stuff	we	've	found	.
some	of	the	stuff	we	share	is	stuff	we	've	made	out	of	what	we	've	found	,	and	all	of	it	 horr 	 ifies 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
so	pipa	and	sopa	are	round	two	.
but	where	the	dmca	was	 sur 	 gical 	 	--	we	want	to	go	down	 in 	 to 	 	your	computer	,	we	want	to	go	down	 in 	 to 	 	your	 tele 	 vision 	 	set	,	down	 in 	 to 	 	your	game	machine	,	and	prevent	it	from	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	 s 	 aid 	 	it	would	do	at	the	store	--	pipa	and	sopa	are	nuclear	and	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	we	want	to	go	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	and	censor	content	.
now	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	is	you	need	to	take	out	 any 	 body 	 	 point 	 ing 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	ip	 address 	 es 	 	.
you	need	to	take	them	out	of	search	 engine 	 s 	 	,	you	need	to	take	them	out	of	 on 	 line 	 	 director 	 ies 	 	,	you	need	to	take	them	out	of	user	 list 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 produce 	 rs 	 	of	content	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	are	not	google	and	yahoo	,	they	're	us	,	we	're	the	people	 get 	 ting 	 	 police 	 d 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	end	,	the	real	threat	to	the	 enact 	 ment 	 	of	pipa	and	sopa	is	our	ability	to	share	 thing 	 s 	 	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	what	pipa	and	sopa	risk	 do 	 ing 	 	is	taking	a	centuries	-	old	legal	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 un 	 til 	 	proven	 guilt 	 y 	 	,	and	 revers 	 ing 	 	it	--	 guilt 	 y 	 	 un 	 til 	 	proven	 innoc 	 ent 	 	.
you	ca	n't	share	 un 	 til 	 	you	show	us	that	you	're	not	sharing	 some 	 thing 	 	we	do	n't	like	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	the	burden	of	proof	for	legal	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	 fall 	 s 	 	 affirm 	 ative 	 ly 	 	on	us	and	on	the	 service 	 s 	 	that	might	be	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	us	any	new	 cap 	 abilities 	 	.
and	if	it	 cost 	 s 	 	even	a	 di 	 me 	 	to	police	a	user	,	that	will	crush	a	service	with	a	hundred	million	 user 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 inter 	 net 	 	they	have	in	mind	.
imagine	 th 	 is 	 	sign	 every 	 where 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	imagine	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	say	college	 bake 	 ry 	 	,	imagine	it	 say 	 s 	 	youtube	and	facebook	and	twitter	.
imagine	it	 say 	 s 	 	ted	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 comment 	 s 	 	ca	n't	be	 police 	 d 	 	at	any	 accept 	 able 	 	cost	.
the	real	 effect 	 s 	 	of	sopa	and	pipa	are	going	to	be	different	than	the	 pro 	 posed 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	.
the	threat	,	in	fact	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 version 	 	of	the	burden	of	proof	,	where	we	 sudden 	 ly 	 	are	all	 treat 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 iev 	 es 	 	at	every	moment	we	're	 give 	 n 	 	the	 free 	 dom 	 	to	create	,	to	produce	or	to	share	.
and	the	people	who	provide	 t 	 hose 	 	 cap 	 abilities 	 	to	us	--	the	youtubes	,	the	facebooks	,	the	twitters	and	teds	--	are	in	the	business	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	police	us	,	or	 be 	 ing 	 	on	the	hook	for	 contributor 	 y 	 	 in 	 fringe 	 ment 	 	.
there	's	two	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	to	help	stop	 th 	 is 	 	--	a	simple	thing	and	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	an	easy	thing	and	a	hard	thing	.
the	simple	thing	,	the	easy	thing	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	if	you	're	an	american	citizen	,	call	your	 represent 	 ative 	 	,	call	your	senator	.
when	you	look	at	the	people	who	co	-	 sign 	 ed 	 	on	the	sopa	bill	,	people	who	've	co	-	 sign 	 ed 	 	on	pipa	,	what	you	see	is	that	they	have	 cumulative 	 ly 	 	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 million 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	from	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	media	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
you	do	n't	have	 million 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	but	you	can	call	your	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	 re 	 mind 	 	them	that	you	vote	,	and	you	can	ask	not	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	like	a	 th 	 ie 	 f 	 	,	and	you	can	suggest	that	you	would	prefer	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	not	be	broken	.
and	if	you	're	not	an	american	citizen	,	you	can	contact	american	 citizen 	 s 	 	that	you	know	and	 encourag 	 e 	 	them	to	do	the	same	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	like	a	national	issue	,	but	it	is	not	.
these	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	will	not	be	content	with	 break 	 ing 	 	our	 inter 	 net 	 	.
if	they	break	it	,	they	will	break	it	for	 every 	 body 	 	.
that	's	the	easy	thing	.
that	's	the	simple	thing	.
the	hard	thing	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	get	ready	,	 be 	 cause 	 	more	is	coming	.
sopa	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	 re 	 version 	 	of	coica	,	which	was	 purpose 	 d 	 	last	year	,	which	did	not	pass	.
and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	the	failure	of	the	dmca	to	 dis 	 allow 	 	sharing	 a 	 s 	 	a	technical	 mean 	 s 	 	.
and	the	dmca	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	the	audio	home	 record 	 ing 	 	act	,	which	 horr 	 ified 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	whole	business	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	 some 	 one 	 	is	 break 	 ing 	 	the	law	and	then	 gather 	 ing 	 	evidence	and	 prov 	 ing 	 	that	,	that	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 convenient 	 	.
``	we	'd	prefer	not	to	do	that	,	``	 say 	 s 	 	the	content	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
and	what	they	want	is	not	to	have	to	do	that	.
they	do	n't	want	legal	 distinct 	 ions 	 	between	legal	and	 il 	 legal 	 	sharing	.
they	just	want	the	sharing	to	go	away	.
pipa	and	sopa	are	not	 odd 	 ities 	 	,	they	're	not	 anomal 	 ies 	 	,	they	're	not	 event 	 s 	 	.
they	're	the	next	turn	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	screw	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	20	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
and	if	we	defeat	these	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	hope	we	do	,	more	is	coming	.
