so	there	are	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 br 	 ing 	 	us	 human 	 s 	 	together	in	the	way	that	an	election	 do 	 es 	 	.
we	stand	in	 election 	 s 	 	;	we	vote	in	 election 	 s 	 	;	we	 observ 	 e 	 	 election 	 s 	 	.
our	 demo 	 cracies 	 	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 election 	 s 	 	.
we	all	understand	why	we	have	 election 	 s 	 	,	and	we	all	 leav 	 e 	 	the	house	on	the	same	day	to	go	and	vote	.
we	 cher 	 ish 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	have	our	say	,	to	help	decide	the	future	of	the	country	.
the	fundamental	idea	is	that	 politic 	 ians 	 	are	 give 	 n 	 	 man 	 date 	 	to	speak	for	us	,	to	make	 decision 	 s 	 	on	our	 be 	 half 	 	that	affect	us	all	.
 with 	 out 	 	that	 man 	 date 	 	,	they	would	be	corrupt	.
well	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	power	 corrupt 	 s 	 	,	and	so	people	will	do	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	get	power	and	to	stay	in	power	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 election 	 s 	 	.
you	see	,	even	if	the	idea	of	the	election	is	perfect	,	running	a	 country 	 wide 	 	election	is	a	big	project	,	and	big	 project 	 s 	 	are	 mess 	 y 	 	.
 when 	 ever 	 	there	is	an	election	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	 some 	 thing 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 go 	 es 	 	wrong	,	 some 	 one 	 	tries	to	cheat	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	 accident 	 ally 	 	 a 	 wry 	 	--	a	 ball 	 ot 	 	box	 go 	 es 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	here	,	 cha 	 d 	 s 	 	are	left	 hang 	 ing 	 	over	here	.
to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	 a 	 s 	 	few	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	go	wrong	,	we	have	all	these	 procedure 	 s 	 	around	the	election	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	come	to	the	 poll 	 ing 	 	station	,	and	a	poll	station	 work 	 er 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	for	your	id	before	giving	you	a	 ball 	 ot 	 	form	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	 vot 	 ing 	 	booth	to	fill	out	your	vote	.
when	you	come	back	out	,	you	get	to	drop	your	vote	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ball 	 ot 	 	box	where	it	 mix 	 es 	 	with	all	the	other	 vote 	 s 	 	,	so	that	no	one	 know 	 s 	 	how	you	 vot 	 ed 	 	.
well	,	what	i	want	us	to	think	about	for	a	moment	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	after	that	,	after	you	drop	your	vote	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ball 	 ot 	 	box	.
and	most	people	would	go	home	and	feel	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	vote	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 count 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	trust	that	the	election	system	 work 	 s 	 	.
they	trust	that	election	 work 	 ers 	 	and	election	 observ 	 ers 	 	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	and	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	.
the	 ball 	 ot 	 	boxes	go	to	 count 	 ing 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 un 	 seal 	 ed 	 	and	the	 vote 	 s 	 	are	 pour 	 ed 	 	out	and	 labor 	 iously 	 	 count 	 ed 	 	.
most	of	us	have	to	trust	that	that	 happen 	 s 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	for	our	own	vote	,	and	we	all	have	to	trust	that	that	 happen 	 s 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	for	all	the	 vote 	 s 	 	in	the	election	.
so	we	have	to	trust	a	lot	of	people	.
we	have	to	trust	a	lot	of	 procedure 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	even	have	to	trust	 computer 	 s 	 	.
so	imagine	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 vot 	 ers 	 	 cast 	 ing 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 vote 	 s 	 	,	all	to	be	 count 	 ed 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	and	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	possibly	go	wrong	 caus 	 ing 	 	all	these	bad	 head 	 lines 	 	,	and	you	can	not	help	but	feel	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	at	the	idea	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 election 	 s 	 	better	.
well	in	the	face	of	all	these	bad	 head 	 lines 	 	,	 research 	 ers 	 	have	taken	a	step	back	and	thought	about	how	we	can	do	 election 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
they	've	 zoom 	 ed 	 	out	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	big	picture	.
and	the	big	picture	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	 election 	 s 	 	should	be	 ver 	 ifiable 	 	.
 vot 	 ers 	 	should	be	able	to	check	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 vote 	 s 	 	are	 count 	 ed 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 break 	 ing 	 	election	secrecy	,	which	is	so	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	that	's	the	tough	part	.
how	do	we	make	an	election	system	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 ifiable 	 	while	 keep 	 ing 	 	the	 vote 	 s 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	secret	?
well	,	the	way	we	've	come	up	with	uses	 computer 	 s 	 	but	 do 	 es 	 	n't	depend	on	them	.
and	the	secret	is	the	 ball 	 ot 	 	form	.
and	if	you	look	 close 	 ly 	 	at	these	 ball 	 ot 	 	 form 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	notice	that	the	 candid 	 ate 	 	list	is	in	a	different	order	on	each	one	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	if	you	mark	your	 choice 	 s 	 	on	one	of	them	and	then	 re 	 move 	 	the	 candid 	 ate 	 	list	,	i	wo	n't	be	able	to	tell	from	the	bit	 remain 	 ing 	 	what	your	vote	is	for	.
and	on	each	 ball 	 ot 	 	form	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	 encrypt 	 ed 	 	value	in	the	form	of	 th 	 is 	 	2d	 bar 	 code 	 	on	the	right	.
and	there	's	some	 complic 	 ated 	 	 crypto 	 graphy 	 	going	on	in	there	,	but	what	's	not	 complic 	 ated 	 	is	 vot 	 ing 	 	with	one	of	these	 form 	 s 	 	.
so	we	can	let	 computer 	 s 	 	do	all	the	 complic 	 ated 	 	 crypto 	 graphy 	 	for	us	,	and	then	we	'll	use	the	paper	for	 ver 	 ification 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	vote	.
you	get	one	of	these	 ball 	 ot 	 	 form 	 s 	 	at	random	,	and	then	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 vot 	 ing 	 	booth	,	and	you	mark	your	 choice 	 s 	 	,	and	you	tear	 a 	 long 	 	a	 perfo 	 ration 	 	.
and	you	shred	the	 candid 	 ate 	 	list	.
and	the	bit	that	 remain 	 s 	 	,	the	one	with	your	 mark 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	your	 encrypt 	 ed 	 	vote	.
so	you	let	a	poll	station	 work 	 er 	 	 s 	 can 	 	your	 encrypt 	 ed 	 	vote	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 encrypt 	 ed 	 	,	it	can	be	 submit 	 ted 	 	,	 store 	 d 	 	and	 count 	 ed 	 	 central 	 ly 	 	and	 dis 	 play 	 ed 	 	on	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	see	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	you	.
so	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	 encrypt 	 ed 	 	vote	home	 a 	 s 	 	your	receipt	.
and	after	the	close	of	the	election	,	you	can	check	that	your	vote	was	 count 	 ed 	 	by	 compar 	 ing 	 	your	receipt	to	the	vote	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	remember	,	the	vote	is	 encrypt 	 ed 	 	from	the	moment	you	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 vot 	 ing 	 	booth	,	so	if	an	election	official	 want 	 s 	 	to	find	out	how	you	 vot 	 ed 	 	,	they	will	not	be	able	to	.
if	the	government	 want 	 s 	 	to	find	out	how	you	 vot 	 ed 	 	,	they	wo	n't	be	able	to	.
no	 hack 	 er 	 	can	break	in	and	find	out	how	you	 vot 	 ed 	 	.
no	 hack 	 er 	 	can	break	in	and	change	your	vote	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	it	wo	n't	match	your	receipt	.
 vote 	 s 	 	ca	n't	go	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	then	you	wo	n't	find	 your 	 s 	 	when	you	look	for	it	.
but	the	election	magic	 do 	 es 	 	n't	stop	there	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	want	to	make	the	whole	process	so	 trans 	 parent 	 	that	news	media	and	 inter 	 national 	 	 observ 	 ers 	 	and	 any 	 one 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	can	download	all	the	election	data	and	do	the	count	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	can	check	that	all	the	 vote 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 count 	 ed 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	.
they	can	check	that	the	 announce 	 d 	 	result	of	the	election	is	the	correct	one	.
and	these	are	 election 	 s 	 	by	the	people	,	for	the	people	.
so	the	next	step	for	our	 demo 	 cracies 	 	are	 trans 	 parent 	 	and	 ver 	 ifiable 	 	 election 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
