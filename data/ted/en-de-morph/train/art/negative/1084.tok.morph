ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 exact 	 ly 	 	,	i	was	in	afghanistan	.
i	was	 cover 	 ing 	 	the	war	in	afghanistan	,	and	i	 witness 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 report 	 er 	 	for	al	jazeera	,	the	amount	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	 destruct 	 ion 	 	that	 emerge 	 d 	 	out	of	a	war	like	that	.
then	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	 cover 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	war	--	the	war	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
i	was	 place 	 d 	 	at	the	center	of	that	war	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 cover 	 ing 	 	the	war	from	the	 north 	 ern 	 	part	of	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
and	the	war	 end 	 ed 	 	with	a	regime	change	,	like	the	one	in	afghanistan	.
and	that	regime	that	we	got	rid	of	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 dictator 	 ship 	 	,	an	 author 	 itarian 	 	regime	,	that	for	 decade 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	great	sense	of	 para 	 lysis 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	nation	,	 with 	 in 	 	the	people	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	change	that	came	through	foreign	intervention	 create 	 d 	 	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	for	the	people	and	 deepen 	 ed 	 	the	sense	of	 para 	 lysis 	 	and	 infer 	 ior 	 ity 	 	in	that	part	of	the	world	.
for	 decade 	 s 	 	,	we	have	lived	under	 author 	 itarian 	 	 regime 	 s 	 	--	in	the	arab	world	,	in	the	middle	east	.
these	 regime 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	us	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	period	.
i	'm	43	 year 	 s 	 	old	right	now	.
for	the	last	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	have	 s 	 een 	 	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	 face 	 s 	 	for	 king 	 s 	 	and	 pre 	 sidents 	 	 rul 	 ing 	 	us	--	old	,	aged	,	 author 	 itarian 	 	,	corrupt	 situ 	 ations 	 	--	 regime 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	around	us	.
and	for	a	moment	i	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	are	we	going	to	live	in	order	to	see	real	change	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	ground	,	a	change	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	come	through	foreign	intervention	,	through	the	 mis 	 ery 	 	of	occupation	,	through	 nation 	 s 	 	 invad 	 ing 	 	our	land	and	 deepen 	 ing 	 	the	sense	of	 infer 	 ior 	 ity 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	?
the	iraqis	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	got	rid	of	saddam	hussein	,	but	when	they	saw	 the 	 ir 	 	land	occupied	by	foreign	 force 	 s 	 	they	felt	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	,	they	felt	that	 the 	 ir 	 	dignity	had	 suffer 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	they	 revolt 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	they	did	not	accept	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	other	 regime 	 s 	 	,	they	told	 the 	 ir 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	``	would	you	like	to	see	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	of	 ir 	 aq 	 	?
would	you	like	to	see	civil	war	,	 s 	 ect 	 arian 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	?
would	you	like	to	see	 destruct 	 ion 	 	?
would	you	like	to	see	foreign	 troop 	 s 	 	on	your	land	?	``
and	the	people	thought	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	``	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	live	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 author 	 itarian 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	we	find	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	second	scenario	.	``
that	was	one	of	the	worst	 nightmare 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	.
for	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	we	have	found	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 report 	 ing 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	 image 	 s 	 	of	 kill 	 ing 	 	,	of	 s 	 ect 	 arian 	 	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	 image 	 s 	 	of	violence	,	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	a	 magnific 	 ent 	 	piece	of	land	,	a	region	that	one	day	was	the	source	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	art	and	culture	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	i	am	here	to	tell	you	that	the	future	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 dream 	 ing 	 	for	 ha 	 s 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.

we	have	found	a	new	way	to	express	our	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	to	express	our	 dream 	 s 	 	:	these	young	people	who	have	 resto 	 red 	 	self	-	confidence	in	our	 nation 	 s 	 	in	that	part	of	the	world	,	who	have	 give 	 n 	 	us	new	meaning	for	 free 	 dom 	 	and	 empower 	 ed 	 	us	to	go	down	to	the	 street 	 s 	 	.

just	step	out	of	your	house	,	raise	your	voice	and	say	,	``	we	would	like	to	see	the	end	of	the	regime	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	tunisia	.

and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	these	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 mis 	 led 	 	.	``
 there 	 fore 	 	,	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	to	go	down	to	the	 street 	 s 	 	and	collect	them	,	 br 	 ing 	 	them	back	home	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.

 parent 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	to	the	 street 	 s 	 	and	they	 support 	 ed 	 	them	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	revolution	was	born	in	tunisia	.
we	in	al	jazeera	 we 	 re 	 	 bann 	 ed 	 	from	tunisia	for	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	the	government	did	not	allow	any	al	jazeera	 report 	 er 	 	to	be	there	.
but	we	found	that	these	people	in	the	street	,	all	of	them	are	our	 report 	 ers 	 	,	 feed 	 ing 	 	our	 news 	 room 	 	with	 picture 	 s 	 	,	with	 video 	 s 	 	and	with	news	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	that	 news 	 room 	 	in	doha	 be 	 came 	 	a	center	that	 receiv 	 ed 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 in 	 put 	 	from	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	--	people	who	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	and	people	who	have	 ambit 	 ion 	 	and	who	have	 liberate 	 d 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 infer 	 ior 	 ity 	 	.
and	then	we	took	that	decision	:	we	are	 un 	 roll 	 ing 	 	the	news	.
we	are	going	to	be	the	voice	for	these	 voice 	 less 	 	people	.
we	are	going	to	spread	the	 mess 	 age 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	some	of	these	young	people	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	but	the	 connect 	 ivity 	 	in	the	arab	world	is	 ver 	 y 	 	little	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	are	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	.
but	al	jazeera	took	the	voice	from	these	people	and	we	 ampl 	 ified 	 	[	it	]	.
we	put	it	in	every	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	room	in	the	arab	world	--	and	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	,	 global 	 ly 	 	,	through	our	english	channel	.
and	then	people	 start 	 ed 	 	to	feel	that	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	new	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	zine	al-abidine	ben	ali	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	.
and	then	egypt	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	hosni	mubarak	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	.
and	now	libya	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	it	.
and	then	you	have	yemen	.
and	you	have	 man 	 y 	 	other	 count 	 ries 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	see	and	to	 re 	 discover 	 	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	,	``	how	do	we	imagine	a	future	which	is	 magnific 	 ent 	 	and	 peace 	 ful 	 	and	 toler 	 ant 	 	?	``
i	want	to	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	,	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	 connect 	 ivity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	[	a	]	new	 mind 	 set 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 mind 	 set 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	be	 faith 	 ful 	 	to	the	 s 	 oil 	 	and	to	the	land	that	it	 emerge 	 d 	 	from	.
and	while	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	major	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 man 	 y 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 s 	 	before	to	create	change	,	before	we	thought	,	and	 government 	 s 	 	told	us	--	and	even	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	was	true	--	that	change	was	 impose 	 d 	 	on	us	,	and	people	 reject 	 ed 	 	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	thought	that	it	is	alien	to	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	.
 al 	 ways 	 	,	we	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	change	will	spring	from	 with 	 in 	 	,	that	change	should	be	a	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	with	culture	,	cultural	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	with	our	faith	in	our	tradition	and	in	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	but	at	the	same	time	,	open	to	universal	 value 	 s 	 	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	the	world	,	 toler 	 ant 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	moment	that	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	right	now	in	the	arab	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	right	moment	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	actual	moment	that	we	see	all	of	these	 meaning 	 s 	 	meet	together	and	then	create	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 magnific 	 ent 	 	era	that	will	emerge	from	the	region	.
how	did	the	elite	deal	with	that	--	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	elite	?
in	front	of	facebook	,	they	 br 	 ought 	 	the	 camel 	 s 	 	in	tahrir	square	.
in	front	of	al	jazeera	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	creating	 trib 	 al 	 ism 	 	.
and	then	when	they	 fail 	 ed 	 	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	about	 conspi 	 r 	 acies 	 	that	 emerge 	 d 	 	from	tel	aviv	and	washington	in	order	to	divide	the	arab	world	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	west	,	``	be	aware	of	al	-	qaeda	.

chris	anderson	:	i	just	have	a	couple	of	 question 	 s 	 	for	you	.
thank	you	for	coming	here	.
how	would	you	 character 	 ize 	 	the	 historic 	 al 	 	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	of	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	a	story	-	of	-	the	-	year	,	a	story	-	of	-	the	-	decade	or	 some 	 thing 	 	more	?
wadah	khanfar	:	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	story	that	we	have	ever	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
we	have	 cover 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 war 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 cover 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	,	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	conflict	 zone 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	hot	 spot 	 s 	 	in	the	region	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 center 	 ed 	 	at	the	middle	of	it	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	story	--	it	is	a	great	story	;	it	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
it	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	 on 	 ly 	 	cover	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	cover	a	great	incident	.
you	are	 witness 	 ing 	 	change	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
you	are	 witness 	 ing 	 	the	birth	of	a	new	era	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	story	's	all	about	.
ca	:	there	are	a	lot	of	people	in	the	west	who	are	still	 skeptic 	 al 	 	,	or	think	 th 	 is 	 	may	just	be	an	 inter 	 mediate 	 	stage	before	much	more	 alarm 	 ing 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	.
you	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	if	there	are	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 election 	 s 	 	in	egypt	now	,	that	a	government	could	emerge	that	 e 	 spouse 	 s 	 	some	of	the	 value 	 s 	 	you	've	spoken	about	so	 inspiring 	 ly 	 	?
wk	:	and	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	after	the	collapse	of	the	hosni	mubarak	regime	,	the	youth	who	have	 organize 	 d 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	certain	 group 	 s 	 	and	 council 	 s 	 	,	they	are	 guard 	 ing 	 	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	and	they	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	it	on	a	track	in	order	to	satisfy	the	 value 	 s 	 	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	but	at	the	same	time	 al 	 so 	 	to	make	it	 reason 	 able 	 	and	to	make	it	rational	,	not	to	go	out	of	order	.
in	my	opinion	,	these	people	are	much	more	 wis 	 er 	 	than	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 politic 	 al 	 	elite	,	even	the	intellectual	elite	,	even	 op 	 position 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	.
