i	'm	a	creative	 techno 	 logist 	 	and	the	focus	of	my	work	is	on	public	 install 	 ations 	 	.
one	of	my	 driv 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 ions 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	nature	,	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	 hid 	 den 	 	data	 with 	 in 	 	nature	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	 lat 	 ent 	 	potential	 every 	 where 	 	,	all	around	us	.
 every 	 thing 	 	 give 	 s 	 	out	some	kind	of	data	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	sound	or	smell	or	vibration	.
through	my	work	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	ways	to	harness	and	unveil	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	led	me	to	a	subject	 call 	 ed 	 	 cymatic 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 cymatic 	 s 	 	is	the	process	of	 visual 	 izing 	 	sound	by	 bas 	 ically 	 	 vib 	 rating 	 	a	medium	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	sand	or	water	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	there	.
so	,	if	we	have	a	quick	look	at	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 cymatic 	 s 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	with	the	 observ 	 ations 	 	of	 reson 	 ance 	 	,	by	da	vinci	,	galileo	,	the	english	scientist	robert	hook	and	then	ernest	chladni	.
he	 create 	 d 	 	an	experiment	using	a	metal	plate	,	 cover 	 ing 	 	it	with	sand	and	then	 bow 	 ing 	 	it	to	create	the	chladni	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	you	see	here	on	the	right	.
moving	on	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	next	person	to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	field	was	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	hans	jenny	in	the	1970s	.
he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	the	term	 cymatic 	 s 	 	.
then	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	the	present	day	is	a	fellow	 collabor 	 ator 	 	of	mine	and	 cymatic 	 s 	 	expert	,	john	stewart	 re 	 ed 	 	.
he	's	 kind 	 ly 	 	 re 	 create 	 d 	 	for	us	the	chladni	experiment	.
what	we	can	see	here	is	the	metal	sheet	,	 th 	 is 	 	time	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	a	sound	driver	and	 be 	 ing 	 	fed	by	a	frequency	 gene 	 rator 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	,	so	do	the	 complex 	 ities 	 	of	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	appear	on	the	plate	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	with	your	own	 eye 	 s 	 	.
so	,	what	 excit 	 es 	 	me	about	 cymatic 	 s 	 	?
well	,	for	me	 cymatic 	 s 	 	is	an	 al 	 most 	 	 magic 	 al 	 	tool	.
it	's	like	a	looking	glass	 in 	 to 	 	a	 hid 	 den 	 	world	.
through	the	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	ways	that	we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	 cymatic 	 s 	 	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	to	unveil	the	 sub 	 stance 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	not	 s 	 een 	 	.
 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	like	the	 cy 	 ma 	 scope 	 	,	which	you	can	see	here	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	used	to	 scientific 	 ally 	 	 observ 	 e 	 	cymatic	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
and	the	list	of	scientific	 application 	 s 	 	is	growing	every	day	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	 ocean 	 ography 	 	,	a	 lexic 	 on 	 	of	dolphin	language	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	 bas 	 ically 	 	 visual 	 izing 	 	the	 son 	 ar 	 	 beam 	 s 	 	that	the	 dolphin 	 s 	 	emit	.
and	 hope 	 fully 	 	in	the	future	we	'll	be	able	to	gain	some	 deep 	 er 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	how	they	communicate	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	use	 cymatic 	 s 	 	for	 heal 	 ing 	 	and	education	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 install 	 ation 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	with	school	children	,	where	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	are	 track 	 ed 	 	.	it	 allow 	 s 	 	them	to	control	and	position	cymatic	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	the	 reflect 	 ions 	 	that	are	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	them	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	use	 cymatic 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	natural	art	form	.
 th 	 is 	 	image	here	is	 create 	 d 	 	from	a	 snip 	 pet 	 	of	beethoven	's	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	 sym 	 phony 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	through	a	cymatic	 de 	 vice 	 	.
so	it	kind	of	 flip 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	head	a	little	bit	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	pink	floyd	's	``	machine	``	 play 	 ing 	 	in	real	time	through	the	 cy 	 ma 	 scope 	 	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	use	 cymatic 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	looking	glass	 in 	 to 	 	nature	.
and	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 create 	 	the	 arche 	 ty 	 pal 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	nature	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	here	on	the	left	we	can	see	a	 snow 	 flake 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	would	appear	in	nature	.
then	on	the	right	we	can	see	a	 cymatic 	 ally 	 	 create 	 d 	 	 snow 	 flake 	 	.
and	here	is	a	 star 	 fish 	 	and	a	cymatic	 star 	 fish 	 	.
and	there	is	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	mean	?
well	,	there	is	still	a	lot	to	explore	in	 it 	 s 	 	early	 day 	 s 	 	.	and	there	's	not	 man 	 y 	 	people	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	.
but	consider	for	a	moment	that	sound	 do 	 es 	 	have	form	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	it	can	affect	matter	and	cause	form	 with 	 in 	 	matter	.
then	sort	of	take	a	leap	and	think	about	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	.
and	think	about	the	immense	sound	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	we	kind	of	ponder	on	that	,	then	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 cymatic 	 s 	 	had	an	influence	on	the	 form 	 ation 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	here	is	some	eye	 can 	 dy 	 	for	you	,	from	a	range	of	diy	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 artist 	 s 	 	from	all	over	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
 cymatic 	 s 	 	is	 access 	 ible 	 	to	 every 	 body 	 	.
i	want	to	urge	 every 	 body 	 	here	to	 app 	 ly 	 	your	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	your	knowledge	and	your	 skill 	 s 	 	to	 area 	 s 	 	like	 cymatic 	 s 	 	.
i	think	 collect 	 ively 	 	we	can	build	a	global	community	.
we	can	inspire	each	other	.
and	we	can	evolve	 th 	 is 	 	exploration	of	the	 sub 	 stance 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	not	 s 	 een 	 	.	thank	you	.
