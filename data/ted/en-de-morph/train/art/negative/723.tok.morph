well	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 balloon 	 ing 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	at	the	end	of	these	balloon	 flight 	 s 	 	around	the	world	i	did	with	brian	jones	.
when	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	the	window	was	 froze 	 n 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 moist 	 ure 	 	of	the	night	.
and	on	the	other	side	there	was	a	 ris 	 ing 	 	 s 	 un 	 	.
so	,	you	see	that	on	the	other	side	of	ice	you	have	the	 un 	 known 	 	,	you	have	the	non	-	obvious	,	you	have	the	non	-	 s 	 een 	 	,	for	the	people	who	do	n't	 da 	 re 	 	to	go	through	the	ice	.
there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	who	prefer	to	suffer	in	the	ice	they	know	 in 	 stead 	 	of	taking	the	risk	of	going	through	the	ice	to	see	what	there	is	on	the	other	side	.
and	i	think	that	's	one	of	the	main	 problem 	 s 	 	of	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
we	learn	,	 may 	 be 	 	not	the	famous	ted	audience	,	but	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	learn	,	that	the	 un 	 known 	 	,	the	 doubt 	 s 	 	,	the	question	 mark 	 s 	 	are	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
and	we	have	to	resist	to	the	 change 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	keep	 every 	 thing 	 	under	control	.
well	,	the	 un 	 known 	 	is	part	of	life	.
and	in	that	sense	,	 balloon 	 ing 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	metaphor	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	balloon	,	like	in	life	,	we	go	 ver 	 y 	 	well	in	 un 	 foresee 	 n 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	.
we	want	to	go	in	a	direction	,	but	the	 wind 	 s 	 	push	us	in	 an 	 other 	 	direction	,	like	in	life	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	fight	 horizon 	 t 	 ally 	 	,	against	life	,	against	the	 wind 	 s 	 	,	against	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	us	,	life	is	a	nightmare	.
how	do	we	steer	a	balloon	?
by	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	the	atmosphere	is	made	out	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	different	 layer 	 s 	 	of	wind	which	all	have	different	direction	.
so	,	then	,	we	understand	that	if	we	want	to	change	our	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	,	in	life	,	or	in	the	balloon	,	we	have	to	change	altitude	.
changing	altitude	,	in	life	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	raising	to	 an 	 other 	 	 psycho 	 logical 	 	,	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	,	spiritual	level	.
but	how	do	we	do	that	?
in	 balloon 	 ing 	 	,	or	in	life	,	how	do	we	change	altitude	?
how	do	we	go	from	the	metaphor	to	 some 	 thing 	 	more	practical	that	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	use	every	day	?
well	,	in	a	balloon	it	's	easy	,	we	have	 ball 	 ast 	 	.
and	when	we	drop	the	 ball 	 ast 	 	 over 	 board 	 	we	climb	.
sand	,	water	,	all	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	we	do	n't	need	 any 	 more 	 	.
and	i	think	in	life	it	should	be	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	know	,	when	people	speak	about	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	spirit	,	 ver 	 y 	 	often	they	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 pioneer 	 s 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	have	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	true	.
the	 pioneer 	 s 	 	are	not	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	have	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	new	 idea 	 s 	 	are	so	easy	to	have	.
we	just	close	our	 eye 	 s 	 	for	a	minute	we	all	come	back	with	a	lot	of	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
no	,	the	pioneer	is	the	one	who	 allow 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	throw	 over 	 board 	 	a	lot	of	 ball 	 ast 	 	.
 habit 	 s 	 	,	 certain 	 ties 	 	,	 convict 	 ions 	 	,	 ex 	 clam 	 ation 	 	 mark 	 s 	 	,	 paradigm 	 s 	 	,	 dogma 	 s 	 	.
and	when	we	are	able	to	do	that	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
life	is	not	 any 	 more 	 	just	one	line	going	in	one	direction	in	one	dimension	.	no	.
life	is	going	to	be	made	out	of	all	the	possible	lines	that	go	in	all	the	possible	 direction 	 s 	 	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
and	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	spirit	will	be	each	time	we	allow	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	 vert 	 ical 	 	axis	.
of	course	not	just	like	the	atmosphere	in	the	balloon	,	but	in	life	 it 	 self 	 	.
explore	 th 	 is 	 	 vert 	 ical 	 	axis	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	explore	all	the	different	ways	to	do	,	all	the	different	ways	to	 behav 	 e 	 	,	all	the	different	ways	to	think	,	before	we	find	the	one	that	 go 	 es 	 	in	the	direction	we	wish	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	be	in	 politic 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	be	in	 spiritual 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	be	in	environment	,	in	finance	,	in	education	of	children	.
i	 deep 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	life	is	a	much	 great 	 er 	 	adventure	if	we	manage	to	do	 politic 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	trench	between	the	left	and	the	right	wing	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	will	throw	away	these	 politic 	 al 	 	 dogma 	 s 	 	.
i	 deep 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	can	make	much	more	 protect 	 ion 	 	of	the	environment	if	we	get	rid	--	if	we	throw	 over 	 board 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 fundamental 	 ism 	 	that	some	of	the	 green 	 s 	 	have	 show 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	.
and	that	we	can	aim	for	much	 high 	 er 	 	 spiritual 	 ity 	 	if	we	get	rid	of	the	religious	 dogma 	 s 	 	.
 throw 	 ing 	 	 over 	 board 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 ball 	 ast 	 	,	to	change	our	direction	.
well	,	these	 bas 	 ically 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	long	time	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	had	to	go	around	the	world	in	a	balloon	to	be	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	talk	about	it	.
it	's	clear	that	it	's	not	easy	to	know	which	 ball 	 ast 	 	to	drop	and	which	altitude	to	take	.	 some 	 time 	 	we	need	 friend 	 s 	 	,	family	 member 	 s 	 	or	a	psychiatrist	.
well	,	in	 balloon 	 s 	 	we	need	weather	men	,	the	one	who	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	direction	of	each	layer	of	wind	,	at	which	altitude	,	in	order	to	help	the	 balloon 	 ist 	 	.
but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 paradox 	 ical 	 	.
when	brian	jones	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	,	the	weather	man	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	,	one	day	,	to	fly	 quit 	 e 	 	low	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 	.
and	when	we	 calcul 	 ated 	 	we	thought	we	're	never	going	to	make	it	around	the	world	at	that	speed	.
so	,	we	 dis 	 obey 	 ed 	 	.	we	flew	much	 high 	 er 	 	,	and	double	the	speed	.
and	i	was	so	proud	to	have	found	that	 jet 	 stream 	 	that	i	 call 	 ed 	 	the	weather	man	,	and	i	told	him	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	guy	,	do	n't	you	think	we	're	good	 pilot 	 s 	 	up	there	?
we	fly	twice	the	speed	you	 predict 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	he	told	me	,	``	do	n't	do	that	.	go	down	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	in	order	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	.	``
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 argu 	 e 	 	.	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	not	going	to	do	that	.
we	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	gas	to	fly	so	 s 	 low 	 	.	``
and	he	told	me	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	but	with	the	low	pressure	you	have	on	your	left	if	you	fly	too	fast	,	in	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	you	will	turn	left	and	end	up	at	the	north	pole	.
and	then	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	will	never	forget	in	my	life	--	he	just	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	you	're	the	good	pilot	up	there	.
what	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	?	you	want	to	go	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	in	the	wrong	direction	,	or	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	in	the	good	direction	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	you	need	 weather 	 men 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	you	need	people	with	long	-	term	vision	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 precise 	 ly 	 	what	 fail 	 s 	 	in	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 vision 	 s 	 	we	have	now	,	in	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 government 	 s 	 	.
we	are	 burn 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	heard	,	so	much	energy	,	not	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	way	of	life	can	not	last	for	long	.
so	,	we	went	down	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
we	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	.	and	we	went	through	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 fear 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	no	idea	how	the	little	amount	of	gas	we	had	in	the	balloon	could	allow	us	to	travel	45,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
but	we	 we 	 re 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	have	 doubt 	 s 	 	;	we	're	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	have	 fear 	 s 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	adventure	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	.
when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	over	the	sahara	and	india	it	was	nice	 holi 	 day 	 s 	 	.
we	could	land	 any 	 time 	 	and	fly	back	home	with	an	 air 	 plane 	 	.
in	the	middle	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	when	you	do	n't	have	the	good	 wind 	 s 	 	,	you	can	not	land	,	you	can	not	go	back	.
that	's	a	crisis	.
that	's	the	moment	when	you	have	to	wake	up	from	the	 autom 	 atic 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	the	moment	when	you	have	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	your	inner	potential	,	your	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
that	's	when	you	throw	out	all	the	 ball 	 ast 	 	,	all	the	 certain 	 ties 	 	,	in	order	to	adapt	to	the	new	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	 change 	 d 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	our	flight	plan	.
we	 change 	 d 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	our	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
and	after	20	 day 	 s 	 	we	 land 	 ed 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	in	egypt	.
but	if	i	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	picture	it	's	not	to	tell	you	how	happy	we	 we 	 re 	 	.
it	's	to	show	you	how	much	gas	was	left	in	the	last	 bottle 	 s 	 	.
we	took	off	with	3.7	 ton 	 s 	 	of	liquid	 pro 	 pane 	 	.
we	 land 	 ed 	 	with	40	 kilo 	 s 	 	.
when	i	saw	that	,	i	made	a	promise	to	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	made	a	promise	that	the	next	time	i	would	fly	around	the	world	,	it	would	be	with	no	fuel	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	from	fossil	 energ 	 ies 	 	,	in	order	to	be	safe	,	not	to	be	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	the	fuel	gauge	.
i	had	no	idea	how	it	was	possible	.
i	just	thought	it	's	a	dream	and	i	want	to	do	it	.
and	when	the	 cap 	 sule 	 	of	my	balloon	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 official 	 ly 	 	in	the	air	and	space	museum	in	washington	,	together	with	the	 air 	 plane 	 	of	charles	lindbergh	,	with	apollo	11	,	with	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	'	 fly 	 er 	 	,	with	chuck	yeager	's	61	,	i	had	 re 	 ally 	 	a	thought	then	.
i	thought	,	well	,	the	20th	century	,	that	was	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.
it	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	do	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	there	.
but	it	will	not	be	possible	in	the	future	any	more	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	too	much	energy	.	it	will	cost	too	much	.
it	will	be	 prohibit 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	'll	have	to	 s 	 ave 	 	our	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	in	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	from	now	.
so	how	can	we	 perpetu 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	spirit	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	will	be	 in 	 dependent 	 	from	fossil	energy	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	the	project	solar	impulse	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	turn	in	my	head	.
and	i	think	it	's	a	nice	metaphor	 al 	 so 	 	for	the	21st	century	.
 pioneer 	 ing 	 	spirit	should	 continu 	 e 	 	,	but	on	 an 	 other 	 	level	.
not	to	conquer	the	planet	or	space	,	not	 any 	 more 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	to	improve	the	quality	of	life	.
how	can	we	go	through	the	ice	of	 certain 	 ty 	 	in	order	to	make	the	most	 in 	 credible 	 	a	possible	thing	?
what	is	 to 	 day 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	--	get	rid	of	our	 depend 	 ency 	 	on	fossil	energy	.
if	you	tell	to	people	,	we	want	to	be	 in 	 dependent 	 	from	fossil	energy	in	our	world	,	people	will	laugh	at	you	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	here	,	where	crazy	people	are	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	speak	.
so	,	the	idea	is	that	if	we	fly	around	the	world	in	a	solar	powered	 air 	 plane 	 	,	using	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	fuel	,	 no 	 body 	 	ever	could	say	in	the	future	that	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	to	do	it	for	 car 	 s 	 	,	for	 heat 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	for	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	and	so	on	.
well	,	solar	power	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	are	not	new	.
they	have	 flow 	 n 	 	in	the	past	,	but	 with 	 out 	 	saving	 cap 	 abilities 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 batt 	 eries 	 	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	they	have	more	proven	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	 renew 	 able 	 	 energ 	 ies 	 	than	the	potential	of	it	.
if	we	want	to	show	the	potential	,	we	have	to	fly	day	and	night	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	to	load	the	 batt 	 eries 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	flight	,	in	order	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	night	on	the	 batt 	 eries 	 	,	and	fly	the	next	day	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	made	,	 al 	 ready 	 	,	on	remote	controlled	little	 air 	 plane 	 	 model 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 pilot 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 stay 	 s 	 	an	anecdote	 be 	 cause 	 	the	public	could	n't	identify	to	it	.
i	think	you	need	a	pilot	in	the	plane	that	can	talk	to	the	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	that	can	talk	to	 student 	 s 	 	,	talk	to	 politic 	 ians 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	flight	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	make	it	a	human	adventure	.
for	that	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	four	 meter 	 s 	 	 wing 	 span 	 	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
you	need	64	meter	 wing 	 span 	 	.
64	meter	 wing 	 span 	 	to	carry	one	pilot	,	the	 batt 	 eries 	 	,	flies	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	with	the	 aero 	 dynamic 	 	efficiency	.
why	that	?	 be 	 cause 	 	fuel	is	not	easy	to	replace	.
that	's	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.
and	with	200	square	 meter 	 s 	 	of	solar	power	on	our	plane	,	we	can	produce	the	same	energy	than	200	little	 light 	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	a	christmas	tree	,	a	big	christmas	tree	.
so	the	question	is	,	how	can	you	carry	a	pilot	around	the	world	with	an	 air 	 plane 	 	that	uses	the	same	amount	of	energy	 a 	 s 	 	a	big	christmas	tree	?
people	will	tell	you	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	,	and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	why	we	try	to	do	it	.
we	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	project	with	my	 col 	 league 	 	andre	borschberg	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	have	now	70	people	in	the	team	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	.
we	have	gone	through	the	 stage 	 s 	 	of	 simul 	 ation 	 	,	design	,	computing	,	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	the	construction	of	the	first	prototype	.
that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	after	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	work	.
 cock 	 pit 	 	,	 propel 	 ler 	 	,	engine	.
just	the	 fuse 	 l 	 age 	 	here	,	it	's	so	light	.
it	's	not	designed	by	an	artist	,	but	it	could	be	.
50	 kilo 	 s 	 	for	the	entire	 fuse 	 l 	 age 	 	.
couple	of	 kilo 	 s 	 	more	for	the	wing	 s 	 par 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	complete	structure	of	the	 air 	 plane 	 	.
and	one	month	ago	we	have	 unveil 	 ed 	 	it	.
you	can	not	imagine	how	it	is	for	a	team	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	six	 year 	 s 	 	on	it	to	show	that	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	a	dream	and	a	vision	,	it	's	a	real	 air 	 plane 	 	.
a	real	 air 	 plane 	 	that	we	could	 final 	 ly 	 	present	.
and	what	's	the	goal	now	?
the	goal	is	to	take	off	,	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	for	the	first	test	,	but	 main 	 ly 	 	next	year	,	spring	or	summer	,	take	off	,	on	our	own	power	,	 with 	 out 	 	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	help	,	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 tow 	 ed 	 	,	climb	to	9,000	 meter 	 s 	 	altitude	.
the	same	time	we	load	the	 batt 	 eries 	 	,	we	run	the	 engine 	 s 	 	,	and	when	we	get	at	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	height	,	we	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	night	.
and	there	,	there	will	be	just	one	goal	,	just	one	:	reach	the	next	 s 	 un 	 rise 	 	before	the	 batt 	 eries 	 	are	empty	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	symbol	of	our	world	.
if	our	 air 	 plane 	 	is	too	heavy	,	if	the	pilot	 waste 	 s 	 	energy	,	we	'll	never	make	it	through	the	night	.
and	in	our	world	,	if	we	keep	on	 spoil 	 ing 	 	,	 was 	 ting 	 	our	energy	 resource 	 s 	 	,	if	we	keep	on	building	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 consum 	 e 	 	so	much	energy	that	most	of	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	now	go	bankrupt	,	it	's	clear	that	we	'll	never	give	the	planet	to	the	next	generation	 with 	 out 	 	a	major	problem	.
so	,	you	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	 air 	 plane 	 	is	more	a	symbol	.
i	do	n't	think	it	will	transport	200	people	in	the	next	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	when	lindbergh	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	atlantic	,	the	 pay 	 load 	 	was	 al 	 so 	 	just	sufficient	for	one	person	and	some	fuel	.
and	20	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	200	people	in	every	 air 	 plane 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	atlantic	.
so	,	we	have	to	start	,	and	show	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
a	little	bit	like	on	 th 	 is 	 	picture	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	from	magritte	,	in	the	museum	in	holland	that	i	love	so	much	.
it	's	a	pipe	,	and	it	's	written	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	pipe	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	 air 	 plane 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	symbol	of	what	we	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	when	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 im 	 possible 	 	,	when	we	have	a	team	,	when	we	have	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	spirit	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	we	understand	that	all	the	 certain 	 ties 	 	we	have	should	be	 throw 	 n 	 	 over 	 board 	 	.
what	 pleas 	 es 	 	me	 ver 	 y 	 	much	is	that	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	i	thought	that	we	would	have	to	fly	around	the	world	with	no	fuel	in	order	to	have	our	 mess 	 age 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	.
and	more	and	more	,	we	're	 invit 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	with	andre	to	talk	about	that	project	,	to	talk	about	the	symbol	of	it	,	 invit 	 ed 	 	by	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	 invit 	 ed 	 	in	energy	 forum 	 s 	 	,	in	order	to	show	that	it	's	not	 any 	 more 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	stupid	to	think	about	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	the	 depend 	 ency 	 	on	fossil	 energ 	 ies 	 	.
so	,	through	 speech 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	 to 	 day 	 	,	through	 interview 	 s 	 	,	through	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	our	goal	is	to	get	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	possible	on	the	team	.
the	success	will	not	come	if	we	``	just	,	``	quote	,	 un 	 quote 	 	,	fly	around	the	world	in	a	solar	-	powered	 air 	 plane 	 	.
no	,	the	success	will	come	if	 en 	 ough 	 	people	are	 motiv 	 ated 	 	to	do	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	,	 s 	 ave 	 	energy	,	go	to	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	possible	.	you	know	,	with	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	between	30	and	50	percent	of	the	energy	of	a	country	in	europe	,	and	we	can	solve	half	of	the	rest	with	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	.
it	 leav 	 es 	 	25	or	30	percent	for	oil	,	gas	,	coal	,	nuclear	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 accept 	 able 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	all	the	people	who	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	spirit	are	welcome	to	be	on	that	team	.
you	can	just	go	on	solarimpulse.com	,	 sub 	 scribe 	 	to	just	be	 inform 	 ed 	 	of	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
but	much	more	,	to	get	 ad 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	to	give	your	 comment 	 s 	 	,	to	spread	the	word	that	if	it	's	possible	in	the	air	,	of	course	it	's	possible	in	the	ground	.
and	each	time	we	have	some	ice	in	the	future	,	we	have	to	know	that	life	will	be	great	,	and	the	success	will	be	 brilli 	 ant 	 	if	we	 da 	 re 	 	to	 over 	 come 	 	our	fear	of	the	ice	,	to	go	through	the	obstacle	,	to	go	through	the	problem	,	in	order	to	see	what	there	is	on	the	other	side	.
so	,	you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	on	our	side	.
 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	his	goal	,	 ha 	 s 	 	his	 dream 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	his	 vision 	 s 	 	.
the	question	i	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	now	is	which	is	the	 ball 	 ast 	 	you	would	like	to	throw	 over 	 board 	 	?
which	will	be	the	altitude	at	which	you	would	like	to	fly	in	your	life	,	to	get	to	the	success	that	you	wish	to	have	,	to	get	to	the	point	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 belong 	 s 	 	to	you	,	with	the	potential	you	have	,	and	the	one	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	fulfill	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	most	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	we	have	is	our	own	potential	,	and	our	own	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	let	's	go	for	it	,	and	i	wish	you	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	adventure	in	the	 wing 	 s 	 	of	the	future	.	thank	you	.
