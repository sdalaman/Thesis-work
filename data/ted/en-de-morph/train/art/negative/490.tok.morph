some	17	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	 alle 	 rgic 	 	to	delhi	's	air	.
my	 doctor 	 s 	 	told	me	that	my	lung	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	had	gone	down	to	70	percent	,	and	it	was	 kill 	 ing 	 	me	.
with	the	help	of	iit	,	teri	,	and	 learn 	 ing 	 s 	 	from	nasa	,	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	there	are	three	 bas 	 ic 	 	green	 plant 	 s 	 	,	common	green	 plant 	 s 	 	,	with	which	we	can	grow	all	the	fresh	air	we	need	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	to	keep	us	 health 	 y 	 	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	found	that	you	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	fresh	air	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	building	,	while	 maintain 	 ing 	 	industry	 in 	 door 	 	air	-	quality	 standard 	 s 	 	.
the	three	 plant 	 s 	 	are	areca	palm	,	mother	-	in	-	law	's	tongue	and	money	plant	.
the	 botanic 	 al 	 	 name 	 s 	 	are	in	front	of	you	.
areca	palm	is	a	plant	which	 re 	 move 	 s 	 	co	2	and	 convert 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	oxygen	.
we	need	four	shoulder	-	high	 plant 	 s 	 	per	person	,	and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	plant	care	,	we	need	to	wipe	the	 leav 	 es 	 	every	day	in	delhi	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	once	a	week	in	 clean 	 er 	 	-	air	cities	.
we	had	to	grow	them	in	 ver 	 mi 	 	 man 	 ure 	 	,	which	is	 steril 	 e 	 	,	or	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	,	and	take	them	 out 	 door 	 s 	 	every	three	to	four	 month 	 s 	 	.
the	second	plant	is	mother	-	in	-	law	's	tongue	,	which	is	 aga 	 in 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	common	plant	,	and	we	call	it	a	 bed 	 room 	 	plant	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 convert 	 s 	 	co	2	 in 	 to 	 	oxygen	at	night	.
and	we	need	six	to	eight	waist	-	high	 plant 	 s 	 	per	person	.
the	third	plant	is	money	plant	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 aga 	 in 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	common	plant	;	 prefer 	 ably 	 	 grow 	 s 	 	in	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	plant	 re 	 move 	 s 	 	 form 	 aldehyde 	 s 	 	and	other	 volatil 	 e 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
with	these	three	 plant 	 s 	 	,	you	can	grow	all	the	fresh	air	you	need	.
in	fact	,	you	could	be	in	a	bottle	with	a	cap	on	top	,	and	you	would	not	die	at	all	,	and	you	would	not	need	any	fresh	air	.
we	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	these	 plant 	 s 	 	at	our	own	building	in	delhi	,	which	is	a	50,000	-	square	-	feet	,	20	-	year	-	old	building	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	close	to	1,200	 s 	 uch 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	for	300	 occu 	 pants 	 	.
our	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	found	that	there	is	a	42	percent	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	one	's	blood	oxygen	going	up	by	one	percent	if	one	 stay 	 s 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	for	10	 hour 	 s 	 	.
the	government	of	india	 ha 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	or	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	 stud 	 y 	 	to	show	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 health 	 iest 	 	building	in	new	delhi	.
and	the	 stud 	 y 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	that	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	other	 building 	 s 	 	,	there	is	a	 reduc 	 ed 	 	incidence	of	eye	 irrit 	 ation 	 	by	52	percent	,	 respirator 	 y 	 	 system 	 s 	 	by	34	percent	,	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	by	24	percent	,	lung	 impair 	 ment 	 	by	12	percent	and	asthma	by	nine	percent	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	on	september	8	,	2008	,	and	it	's	 avail 	 able 	 	on	the	government	of	india	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
our	experience	 point 	 s 	 	to	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	in	human	 product 	 ivity 	 	by	over	20	percent	by	using	these	 plant 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	a	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	energy	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	in	 building 	 s 	 	by	an	 out 	 stand 	 ing 	 	15	percent	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	need	less	fresh	air	.
we	are	now	 replica 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	1.75	-	million	-	square	-	feet	building	,	which	will	have	60,000	 in 	 door 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	.
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
it	is	 al 	 so 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	environment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	world	's	energy	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	are	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	grow	by	30	percent	in	the	next	decade	.
40	percent	of	the	world	's	energy	is	taken	up	by	 building 	 s 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	,	and	60	percent	of	the	world	's	population	will	be	living	in	 building 	 s 	 	in	cities	with	a	population	of	over	one	million	in	the	next	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	there	is	a	growing	 pre 	 ference 	 	for	living	and	 work 	 ing 	 	in	air	-	 condition 	 ed 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
