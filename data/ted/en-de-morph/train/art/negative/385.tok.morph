zach	kaplan	:	keith	and	i	lead	a	research	team	.
we	investigate	 material 	 s 	 	and	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	have	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.	over	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	found	over	200	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	so	we	 look 	 ed 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	our	library	and	 select 	 ed 	 	six	we	thought	would	be	most	surprising	for	ted	.
of	these	six	,	the	first	one	that	we	're	going	to	talk	about	is	in	the	black	 envelop 	 e 	 	you	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	company	in	japan	 call 	 ed 	 	geltech	.	now	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	open	it	up	.
keith	schacht	:	now	be	 s 	 ure 	 	and	take	the	two	 piece 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
what	's	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	it	's	soft	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	strong	magnet	.
zach	and	i	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	 observ 	 ing 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	 s 	 pent 	 	a	long	time	 think 	 ing 	 	about	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	and	it	's	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	that	we	 real 	 ized 	 	:	it	's	when	we	see	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	it	 change 	 s 	 	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	work	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	gel	magnet	for	the	first	time	,	if	you	 assum 	 e 	 	that	all	 magnet 	 s 	 	had	to	be	hard	,	then	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	you	and	it	 change 	 d 	 	your	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	way	 magnet 	 s 	 	could	work	.
zk	:	now	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	what	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	are	.
but	to	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	possible	,	we	found	that	it	 help 	 s 	 	to	think	about	how	it	could	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	.
so	,	a	first	idea	is	to	use	it	on	cabinet	 door 	 s 	 	.
if	you	line	the	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	 cabinet 	 s 	 	using	the	gel	material	--	if	a	cabinet	 s 	 lam 	 s 	 	shut	it	would	n't	make	a	loud	noise	,	and	in	 add 	 ition 	 	the	 magnet 	 s 	 	would	draw	the	 cabinet 	 s 	 	closed	.
imagine	taking	the	same	material	,	but	 put 	 ting 	 	it	on	the	bottom	of	a	 sneak 	 er 	 	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	way	you	could	go	to	the	 contain 	 er 	 	store	and	buy	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	metal	 sheet 	 s 	 	that	they	hang	on	the	back	of	your	door	,	in	your	 close 	 t 	 	,	and	you	could	 liter 	 ally 	 	stick	your	 shoe 	 s 	 	up	 in 	 stead 	 	of	using	a	shelf	.
for	me	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	love	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
if	you	come	to	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	and	see	my	 close 	 t 	 	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	'd	figure	out	why	:	it	's	a	mess	.
ks	:	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	and	then	 see 	 ing 	 	a	couple	of	 application 	 s 	 	--	it	 help 	 s 	 	you	see	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	significant	,	what	the	potential	is	.
but	we	've	found	that	the	way	we	present	our	 idea 	 s 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
zk	:	it	was	like	six	 month 	 s 	 	ago	that	keith	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	out	in	l.a.	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	starbucks	 hav 	 ing 	 	coffee	with	roman	coppola	.
he	 work 	 s 	 	on	 most 	 ly 	 	music	 video 	 s 	 	and	 commercial 	 s 	 	with	his	company	,	the	 director 	 s 	 	bureau	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	roman	told	us	that	he	's	kind	of	an	inventor	on	the	side	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	him	the	same	gel	magnet	that	you	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	in	your	hand	--	and	you	know	,	we	 share 	 d 	 	the	same	 idea 	 s 	 	.	and	you	could	see	it	in	his	face	:	roman	 start 	 s 	 	to	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	and	he	 whip 	 s 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	 man 	 ila 	 	 fold 	 er 	 	;	he	 open 	 s 	 	it	up	and	keith	and	i	look	in	,	and	he	 start 	 s 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	us	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	that	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	just	get	him	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	and	so	we	're	looking	at	these	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	like	,	 who 	 a 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	good	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	way	that	he	 present 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	--	his	approach	was	 total 	 ly 	 	different	than	 our 	 s 	 	.	he	 s 	 old 	 	it	to	you	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	was	for	sale	right	now	.
when	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	in	the	car	back	to	the	 air 	 port 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	:	why	was	 th 	 is 	 	so	 power 	 ful 	 	?
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	thought	about	it	more	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	let	you	fill	in	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	about	the	experience	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	saw	it	on	tv	.	so	,	for	ted	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	our	 favor 	 ite 	 	idea	for	the	gel	magnet	and	work	with	roman	and	his	team	at	the	 director 	 s 	 	bureau	to	create	a	commercial	for	a	product	from	the	future	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	do	you	have	a	need	for	speed	?
inventables	water	 adventure 	 s 	 	 da 	 re 	 s 	 	you	to	launch	 your 	 self 	 	on	a	 magnet 	 ically 	 	-	 levit 	 ating 	 	board	down	a	 water 	 slide 	 	so	fast	,	so	tall	,	that	when	you	hit	the	bottom	,	it	uses	 brake 	 s 	 	to	stop	.
aqua	rocket	:	coming	 th 	 is 	 	summer	.
ks	:	now	,	we	 show 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	to	a	few	people	before	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	,	when	's	it	coming	out	?
so	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	let	you	know	,	it	's	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	coming	out	,	just	the	 con 	 cept 	 	is	.
zk	:	so	now	,	when	we	dream	up	these	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	work	from	a	technical	 stand 	 point 	 	.
so	i	just	want	to	 quick 	 ly 	 	explain	how	 th 	 is 	 	would	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 magnet 	 ically 	 	-	 levit 	 ating 	 	board	that	they	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	in	the	commercial	.
the	gel	that	you	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	would	be	lining	the	bottom	of	the	board	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
one	:	the	soft	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	the	magnet	that	make	it	so	that	,	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	to	hit	the	rider	in	the	head	,	it	would	n't	 inju 	 re 	 	him	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	you	can	see	from	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	on	the	right	,	the	 under 	 part 	 	of	the	slide	would	be	an	 electro 	 magnet 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	repel	the	rider	a	little	bit	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	going	down	.
the	force	of	the	water	 rush 	 ing 	 	down	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	 re 	 pulsion 	 	force	,	would	make	 th 	 is 	 	slide	go	 fast 	 er 	 	than	any	slide	on	the	market	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	that	you	need	the	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 bra 	 king 	 	system	.
when	you	get	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	bottom	of	the	slide	--	--	the	rider	 pass 	 es 	 	through	an	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	tube	.
and	i	'm	going	to	kick	it	to	keith	to	explain	why	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	from	a	technical	 stand 	 point 	 	.
ks	:	so	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	all	you	 engineer 	 s 	 	know	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	is	a	metal	,	it	's	not	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	material	.	but	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	drop	a	magnet	down	an	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	tube	.
so	we	set	up	a	quick	experiment	here	to	show	that	to	you	.
now	,	you	see	the	magnet	fell	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	not	going	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	physics	of	it	,	but	all	you	need	to	know	is	that	the	 fast 	 er 	 	the	magnet	's	 fall 	 ing 	 	,	the	 great 	 er 	 	the	 stop 	 ping 	 	force	.
zk	:	now	,	our	next	technology	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	10	-	foot	pole	,	and	i	have	it	right	here	in	my	pocket	.
there	're	a	few	different	 version 	 s 	 	of	it	.
ks	:	some	of	them	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 un 	 roll 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
they	can	be	made	to	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	roll	up	,	or	they	can	be	made	 s 	 table 	 	,	like	zach	's	,	to	hold	any	position	in	between	.
zk	:	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	 vend 	 or 	 	--	to	try	to	learn	about	how	you	could	 app 	 ly 	 	these	,	or	how	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	--	he	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	that	,	in	the	 militar 	 y 	 	they	use	 th 	 is 	 	one	so	 soldier 	 s 	 	can	keep	it	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 chest 	 s 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 conceal 	 ed 	 	--	and	then	,	when	they	're	out	on	the	field	,	erect	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	antenna	to	 clear 	 ly 	 	 s 	 end 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	back	to	the	base	.
in	our	 brain 	 storm 	 s 	 	,	we	came	up	with	the	idea	you	could	use	it	for	a	soccer	goal	:	so	at	the	end	of	the	game	,	you	just	roll	up	the	goal	and	put	it	in	your	gym	bag	.
ks	:	now	,	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	you	do	n't	have	to	be	an	engineer	to	appreciate	why	a	10	-	foot	pole	that	can	fit	in	your	pocket	is	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	out	onto	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	chicago	and	ask	a	few	people	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	what	they	thought	you	could	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
man	:	i	clean	my	 ceil 	 ing 	 	 fan 	 s 	 	with	that	and	i	get	the	spider	 web 	 s 	 	off	my	house	--	i	do	it	that	way	.
woman	:	i	'd	make	my	 ver 	 y 	 	own	 walk 	 ing 	 	stick	.
woman	:	i	would	create	a	 lad 	 der 	 	to	use	to	get	up	on	top	of	the	tree	.
woman	:	an	 o 	 live 	 	 serv 	 er 	 	.
man	:	some	type	of	 extens 	 ion 	 	pole	--	like	what	the	 paint 	 ers 	 	use	.
woman	:	i	would	make	a	spear	that	,	when	you	went	deep	sea	 div 	 ing 	 	,	you	could	catch	the	fish	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	,	and	then	roll	it	back	up	,	and	you	could	swim	 eas 	 ier 	 	...	 yea 	 h 	 	.
zk	:	now	,	for	our	next	technology	we	're	going	to	do	a	little	 demonst 	 ration 	 	,	and	so	we	need	a	volunteer	from	the	audience	.

so	what	's	the	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	dry	liquid	?
early	 version 	 s 	 	of	the	fluid	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	on	a	cray	 super 	 computer 	 	.
now	,	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	zach	could	stand	up	on	stage	and	drench	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	member	of	the	audience	 with 	 out 	 	any	concern	that	we	'd	damage	the	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	that	we	'd	get	him	wet	,	that	we	'd	hurt	the	 book 	 s 	 	or	the	 computer 	 s 	 	.	it	 work 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	non	-	 conduct 	 ive 	 	.
so	you	can	see	here	,	you	can	 immers 	 e 	 	a	whole	circuit	board	in	 th 	 is 	 	and	it	would	n't	cause	any	damage	.
you	can	 circul 	 ate 	 	it	to	draw	the	heat	away	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	it	's	most	 wide 	 ly 	 	used	in	 off 	 ice 	 	 building 	 s 	 	--	in	the	 sprinkl 	 er 	 	system	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	fire	-	 suppress 	 ion 	 	fluid	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	safe	for	people	.	it	 put 	 s 	 	out	the	 fire 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	hurt	 any 	 thing 	 	.
but	our	 favor 	 ite 	 	idea	for	 th 	 is 	 	was	using	it	in	a	 basket 	 ball 	 	game	.	so	 dur 	 ing 	 	 half 	 time 	 	,	it	could	rain	down	on	the	 player 	 s 	 	,	cool	 every 	 one 	 	down	,	and	in	a	matter	of	 minute 	 s 	 	it	would	dry	.	would	n't	hurt	the	court	.

it	's	 technical 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	shape	-	 retain 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	.	``
now	,	think	about	your	 interact 	 ions 	 	with	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	foil	.
shape	-	 retain 	 ing 	 	is	common	in	metal	:	you	bend	a	piece	of	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	foil	,	and	it	 hold 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	place	.	contrast	that	with	a	plastic	garbage	can	--	and	you	can	push	in	the	 side 	 s 	 	and	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 bounc 	 es 	 	back	.

taking	it	a	little	further	,	if	you	wove	 t 	 hose 	 	 strip 	 s 	 	together	--	kind	of	like	a	little	basket	--	you	could	make	a	shape	-	 retain 	 ing 	 	sheet	,	and	then	you	could	embed	it	in	a	cloth	:	so	you	could	make	a	picnic	sheet	that	 wrap 	 s 	 	around	the	table	,	so	that	way	on	a	 wind 	 y 	 	day	it	would	n't	blow	away	.
for	our	next	technology	,	it	's	hard	to	 observ 	 e 	 	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	ink	.
so	,	we	've	prepared	a	video	to	show	it	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	paper	.

so	with	simple	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	you	can	detect	how	much	the	page	is	 be 	 ing 	 	bent	.

zk	:	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	technology	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	:	professor	ken	suslick	and	neil	rakow	,	of	the	university	of	illinois	.
ks	:	now	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	:	there	's	a	 m 	 atrix 	 	of	color	 dye 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 dye 	 s 	 	change	color	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 odor 	 s 	 	.
so	the	smell	of	 van 	 illa 	 	,	that	might	change	the	four	on	the	left	to	 brow 	 n 	 	and	the	one	on	the	right	to	yellow	.	 th 	 is 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	can	produce	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	different	color	 combination 	 s 	 	to	represent	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	different	 smell 	 s 	 	.
but	like	in	the	milk	commercial	,	if	you	know	what	odor	you	want	to	detect	,	then	they	can	 form 	 ulate 	 	a	specific	dye	to	detect	just	that	odor	.
zk	:	right	.	it	was	that	that	 start 	 ed 	 	a	conversation	with	professor	suslick	and	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	he	was	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	me	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	making	possible	,	beyond	just	 detect 	 ing 	 	 spoil 	 ed 	 	food	.	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	where	the	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	of	it	lies	.
his	company	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	a	survey	of	 fire 	 men 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	to	try	to	learn	,	how	are	they	 current 	 ly 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	the	air	when	they	respond	to	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	scene	?
and	he	kind	of	 com 	 ically 	 	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	time	after	time	,	what	the	 fire 	 men 	 	would	say	is	:	they	would	rush	to	the	scene	of	the	crime	;	they	would	look	around	;	if	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	dead	 police 	 men 	 	,	it	was	ok	to	go	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	true	story	.	they	're	using	 police 	 men 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 can 	 aries 	 	.
but	more	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	they	 determine 	 d 	 	that	you	could	develop	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	can	smell	better	than	the	 human 	 s 	 	,	and	say	if	it	's	safe	for	the	 fire 	 men 	 	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	he	's	 s 	 pun 	 	off	a	company	from	the	university	 call 	 ed 	 	chemsensing	,	where	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	medical	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
so	,	a	patient	can	come	in	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	blow	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
by	 detect 	 ing 	 	the	odor	of	 part 	 icular 	 	bacteria	,	or	viruses	,	or	even	lung	cancer	,	the	 dot 	 s 	 	will	change	and	they	can	use	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	 radical 	 ly 	 	improve	the	way	that	 doctor 	 s 	 	 diagnos 	 e 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	.
 current 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	using	a	method	of	trial	and	error	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	could	tell	you	 precise 	 ly 	 	what	disease	you	have	.
ks	:	so	that	was	the	six	we	had	for	you	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	i	hope	you	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	why	we	find	these	 thing 	 s 	 	so	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	every	one	of	these	six	 change 	 d 	 	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	what	was	possible	in	the	world	.	prior	to	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	would	have	 assum 	 ed 	 	:	a	10	-	foot	pole	could	n't	fit	in	your	pocket	;	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 	 a 	 s 	 	ink	could	n't	sense	the	way	paper	is	 be 	 ing 	 	bent	;	every	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	and	we	're	 constant 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	more	.
zk	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	keith	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	enjoy	 do 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	it	's	obvious	to	you	now	,	but	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	that	i	was	 re 	 minded 	 	of	why	.	i	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	with	steve	jurvetson	,	over	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	by	the	 escal 	 ators 	 	,	and	he	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	when	chris	 s 	 ent 	 	out	that	little	box	,	one	of	the	 item 	 s 	 	in	it	was	the	 hydro 	 phobic 	 	sand	--	the	sand	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	wet	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	was	 play 	 ing 	 	with	it	with	his	son	.
and	you	know	,	his	son	was	 mesmer 	 ized 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	would	dunk	it	in	the	water	,	he	would	take	it	out	and	it	was	bone	dry	.	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	his	son	was	 play 	 ing 	 	with	a	lock	of	his	mother	's	hair	,	and	he	 notice 	 d 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	some	 drop 	 s 	 	of	water	on	the	hair	.
and	he	took	the	thing	and	he	 look 	 ed 	 	up	to	steve	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	 hydro 	 phobic 	 	string	.	``
i	mean	,	after	 hear 	 ing 	 	that	story	--	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 summ 	 ed 	 	it	up	for	me	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
ks	:	thank	you	.
