the	khan	academy	is	most	known	for	 it 	 s 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 video 	 s 	 	,	so	before	i	go	any	further	,	let	me	show	you	a	little	bit	of	a	montage	.

if	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	blow	your	mind	,	then	you	have	no	emotion	.
sk	:	we	now	have	on	the	order	of	2,200	 video 	 s 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	from	 bas 	 ic 	 	arithmetic	all	the	way	to	vector	 calcul 	 us 	 	and	some	of	the	stuff	you	saw	there	.
we	have	a	million	 student 	 s 	 	a	month	using	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	on	the	order	of	100	to	200,000	 video 	 s 	 	a	day	.
but	what	we	're	going	to	talk	about	in	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	're	going	to	the	next	level	.
but	before	i	do	that	,	i	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	 re 	 ally 	 	just	how	i	got	 start 	 ed 	 	.
and	some	of	you	all	might	know	,	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	was	an	analyst	at	a	 hedg 	 e 	 	fund	,	and	i	was	in	boston	,	and	i	was	 tutor 	 ing 	 	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	in	new	orleans	,	 remote 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	the	first	youtube	 video 	 s 	 	up	 re 	 ally 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	nice	-	to	-	have	,	just	a	supplement	for	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	might	give	them	a	 re 	 fresh 	 er 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	i	put	 t 	 hose 	 	first	youtube	 video 	 s 	 	up	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	bunch	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
the	first	was	the	 feed 	 back 	 	from	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	.
they	told	me	that	they	 prefer 	 red 	 	me	on	youtube	than	in	person	.
and	once	you	get	over	the	 back 	 hand 	 ed 	 	nature	of	that	,	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	there	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	they	 prefer 	 red 	 	the	 autom 	 ated 	 	version	of	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	to	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	.
at	first	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 intuitive 	 	,	but	when	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	about	it	from	 the 	 ir 	 	point	of	view	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	ton	of	sense	.
you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	now	they	can	pause	and	repeat	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	,	 with 	 out 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	they	're	 was 	 ting 	 	my	time	.
if	they	have	to	review	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	should	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	they	do	n't	have	to	be	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	and	ask	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	.
they	can	just	watch	 t 	 hose 	 	 video 	 s 	 	.	if	they	're	 bor 	 ed 	 	,	they	can	go	 a 	 head 	 	.
they	can	watch	it	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	time	,	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	.
and	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 l 	 east 	 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	that	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	your	brain	around	a	new	 con 	 cept 	 	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	thing	you	need	is	 an 	 other 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	do	you	understand	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	that	's	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	before	,	and	now	they	can	just	do	it	in	the	 in 	 timacy 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	room	.
the	other	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	--	i	put	them	on	youtube	just	--	i	saw	no	reason	to	make	it	private	,	so	i	let	other	people	watch	it	,	and	then	people	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 tumbling 	 	on	it	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	some	 comment 	 s 	 	and	some	 letter 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 feed 	 back 	 	from	random	people	from	around	the	world	.
and	these	are	just	a	few	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	one	of	the	original	 calcul 	 us 	 	 video 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 one 	 	wrote	just	on	youtube	--	it	was	a	youtube	comment	:	``	first	time	i	 smil 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 deriv 	 ative 	 	.	``
and	let	's	pause	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	person	did	a	 deriv 	 ative 	 	and	then	they	 smil 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	in	a	 respons 	 e 	 	to	that	same	comment	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	 th 	 read 	 	.
you	can	go	on	youtube	and	look	at	these	 comment 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 one 	 	else	wrote	:	``	same	thing	here	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	a	natural	high	and	a	good	mood	for	the	entire	day	.
since	i	remember	 see 	 ing 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	text	in	class	,	and	here	i	'm	all	like	,	'	i	know	 k 	 ung 	 	fu	.	'	``	and	we	get	a	lot	of	 feed 	 back 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	lines	.
 th 	 is 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	was	 help 	 ing 	 	people	.
but	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 view 	 er 	 ship 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	growing	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	growing	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	from	people	,	and	it	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	clear	that	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	than	just	a	nice	-	to	-	have	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	an	excerpt	from	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	.
``	my	12	year	-	old	son	 ha 	 s 	 	 aut 	 ism 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	time	with	math	.
we	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 view 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 b 	 ought 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
we	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	on	your	video	on	 decimal 	 s 	 	and	it	got	through	.
then	we	went	on	to	the	 dread 	 ed 	 	 fraction 	 s 	 	.	 aga 	 in 	 	,	he	got	it	.
we	could	not	 believ 	 e 	 	it	.
he	is	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	so	you	can	imagine	,	here	i	was	an	analyst	at	a	 hedg 	 e 	 	fund	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	for	me	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	of	social	value	.
but	i	was	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	so	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	going	.
and	then	a	few	other	 thing 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	dawn	on	me	.
that	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	would	it	help	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	right	now	,	or	these	people	who	are	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	,	but	that	 th 	 is 	 	content	will	never	go	old	,	that	it	could	help	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
if	isaac	newton	had	 d 	 one 	 	youtube	 video 	 s 	 	on	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	i	would	n't	have	to	.
 assum 	 ing 	 	he	was	good	.	we	do	n't	know	.
the	other	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	and	even	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	a	good	supplement	.
it	's	good	for	 motiv 	 ated 	 	 student 	 s 	 	.
it	's	good	for	 may 	 be 	 	home	 school 	 ers 	 	.	``
but	i	did	n't	think	it	would	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	 some 	 how 	 	penetrate	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
but	then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	from	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	would	write	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	've	used	your	 video 	 s 	 	to	flip	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
you	've	 give 	 n 	 	the	 lectur 	 es 	 	,	so	now	what	we	do	...	``	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	could	happen	in	every	 class 	 room 	 	in	america	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	--	``	...	what	i	do	is	i	assign	the	 lectur 	 es 	 	for	 home 	 work 	 	,	and	what	used	to	be	 home 	 work 	 	,	i	now	have	the	 student 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.	``
and	i	want	to	pause	here	for	--	i	want	to	pause	here	for	a	second	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	couple	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	,	when	 t 	 hose 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	there	's	the	obvious	benefit	--	the	benefit	that	now	 the 	 ir 	 	 student 	 s 	 	can	enjoy	the	 video 	 s 	 	in	the	way	that	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	did	.
they	can	pause	,	repeat	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	,	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	time	.
but	the	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 un 	 intuitive 	 	thing	when	you	talk	about	technology	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	--	by	 re 	 moving 	 	the	one	-	 s 	 ize 	 	-	 fit 	 s 	 	-	all	 lectur 	 e 	 	from	the	 class 	 room 	 	and	 lett 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	have	a	self	-	paced	 lectur 	 e 	 	at	home	,	and	then	when	you	go	to	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	 lett 	 ing 	 	them	do	work	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	teacher	walk	around	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 peer 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	interact	with	each	other	,	these	 teacher 	 s 	 	have	used	technology	to	 human 	 ize 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
they	took	a	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 de 	 human 	 izing 	 	experience	--	30	 kid 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	lips	,	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	interact	with	each	other	.
a	teacher	,	no	matter	how	good	,	 ha 	 s 	 	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	one	-	 s 	 ize 	 	-	 fit 	 s 	 	-	all	 lectur 	 e 	 	to	30	 student 	 s 	 	--	blank	 face 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 ant 	 agon 	 istic 	 	--	and	now	it	's	a	human	experience	.
now	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	each	other	.
so	once	the	khan	academy	--	i	quit	my	job	and	we	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	real	 organ 	 ization 	 	--	we	're	a	not	-	for	-	profit	--	the	question	is	,	how	do	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	next	level	?
how	do	we	take	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	 con 	 clusion 	 	?
and	so	what	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	over	here	,	these	are	actual	 exercis 	 es 	 	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	for	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	.
the	 one 	 s 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 we 	 re 	 	much	more	primitive	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	more	 compete 	 nt 	 	version	of	it	.
but	the	paradigm	here	is	,	we	'll	generate	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 question 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	need	 un 	 til 	 	you	get	that	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	get	10	in	a	row	.
and	the	khan	academy	 video 	 s 	 	are	there	.
you	get	 hint 	 s 	 	,	the	actual	 step 	 s 	 	for	that	problem	,	if	you	do	n't	know	how	to	do	it	.
but	the	paradigm	here	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	thing	:	10	in	a	row	,	you	move	on	.
but	it	's	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	than	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	right	now	.
in	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	 class 	 room 	 	,	you	have	a	couple	of	 home 	 work 	 	,	 home 	 work 	 	,	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	 home 	 work 	 	,	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	and	then	you	have	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	 ex 	 am 	 	.
and	that	 ex 	 am 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	get	a	70	percent	,	an	80	percent	,	a	90	percent	or	a	95	percent	,	the	class	 move 	 s 	 	on	to	the	next	 top 	 ic 	 	.
and	even	that	95	percent	student	,	what	was	the	five	percent	they	did	n't	know	?
 may 	 be 	 	they	did	n't	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	raise	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	zero	power	.
and	then	you	go	build	on	that	in	the	next	 con 	 cept 	 	.
that	's	 analog 	 ous 	 	to	imagine	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	ride	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	i	give	you	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	time	,	and	i	give	you	that	 bi 	 cycle 	 	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	come	back	after	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	i	say	,	``	well	,	let	's	see	.	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	trouble	taking	left	 turn 	 s 	 	.
you	ca	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	stop	.
you	're	an	80	percent	 bi 	 cyclist 	 	.	``
so	i	put	a	big	c	stamp	on	your	 fore 	 head 	 	and	then	i	say	,	``	here	's	a	 uni 	 cycle 	 	.	``
but	 a 	 s 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	 sound 	 s 	 	,	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	our	 class 	 rooms 	 	right	now	.
and	the	idea	is	you	fast	forward	and	good	 student 	 s 	 	start	 fail 	 ing 	 	algebra	all	of	a	sudden	and	start	 fail 	 ing 	 	 calcul 	 us 	 	all	of	a	sudden	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	smart	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	good	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	these	swiss	cheese	 gap 	 s 	 	that	 ke 	 pt 	 	building	 through 	 out 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	.
so	our	model	is	learn	math	the	way	you	'd	learn	 any 	 thing 	 	,	like	the	way	you	would	learn	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
stay	on	that	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.	fall	off	that	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
do	it	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	 un 	 til 	 	you	have	 master 	 y 	 	.
the	 tradition 	 al 	 	model	,	it	 penal 	 ize 	 s 	 	you	for	 experiment 	 ation 	 	and	failure	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	expect	 master 	 y 	 	.
we	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	experiment	.	we	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	failure	.
but	we	do	expect	 master 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	the	 modul 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 tri 	 go 	 no 	 metry 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	shifting	and	 reflect 	 ing 	 	 function 	 s 	 	.
and	they	all	fit	together	.
we	have	about	90	of	these	right	now	.
and	you	can	go	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	right	now	.	it	's	all	free	.	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	 any 	 thing 	 	.
but	the	general	idea	is	that	they	all	fit	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	map	.
that	top	 no 	 de 	 	right	there	,	that	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	single	digit	 add 	 ition 	 	.
it	's	like	one	plus	one	is	equal	to	two	.
and	the	paradigm	is	,	once	you	get	10	in	a	row	on	that	,	it	 keep 	 s 	 	 forward 	 ing 	 	you	to	more	and	more	 advance 	 d 	 	 modul 	 es 	 	.
so	if	you	keep	further	down	the	knowledge	map	,	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	more	 advance 	 d 	 	arithmetic	.
further	down	,	you	start	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	pre	-	algebra	and	early	algebra	.
further	down	,	you	start	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	algebra	one	,	algebra	two	,	a	little	bit	of	 pre 	 calcul 	 us 	 	.
and	the	idea	is	,	from	 th 	 is 	 	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	teach	 every 	 thing 	 	--	well	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	can	be	taught	in	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	a	 frame 	 work 	 	.
so	you	can	imagine	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	--	is	from	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	map	you	have	logic	,	you	have	computer	 programm 	 ing 	 	,	you	have	 gram 	 mar 	 	,	you	have	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	all	based	off	of	that	core	of	,	if	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	and	that	,	now	you	're	ready	for	 th 	 is 	 	next	 con 	 cept 	 	.
now	that	can	work	well	for	an	individual	 learn 	 er 	 	,	and	i	 encourag 	 e 	 	,	one	,	for	you	to	do	it	with	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	audience	to	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
it	'll	change	what	 happen 	 s 	 	at	the	 d 	 inner 	 	table	.
but	what	we	want	to	do	is	to	use	the	natural	 con 	 clusion 	 	of	the	 flip 	 ping 	 	of	the	 class 	 room 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	early	 teacher 	 s 	 	had	 email 	 ed 	 	me	about	.
and	so	what	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	data	from	a	pilot	in	the	los	altos	school	 di 	 strict 	 	,	where	they	took	two	fifth	grade	 class 	 es 	 	and	two	 seven 	 th 	 	grade	 class 	 es 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 gutt 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	old	math	curriculum	.
these	 kid 	 s 	 	are	n't	using	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	 get 	 ting 	 	one	-	 s 	 ize 	 	-	 fit 	 s 	 	-	all	 lectur 	 es 	 	.
they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	khan	academy	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	for	 rough 	 ly 	 	half	of	 the 	 ir 	 	math	class	.
and	i	want	to	make	it	clear	,	we	do	n't	view	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	complete	math	education	.
what	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	los	altos	--	it	 free 	 s 	 	up	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 block 	 ing 	 	and	 tack 	 ling 	 	,	making	 s 	 ure 	 	you	know	how	to	move	through	a	system	of	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	and	it	 free 	 s 	 	up	time	for	the	 simul 	 ations 	 	,	for	the	 game 	 s 	 	,	for	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	for	the	robot	building	,	for	the	estimating	how	high	that	hill	is	based	on	 it 	 s 	 	shadow	.
and	so	the	paradigm	is	the	teacher	 walk 	 s 	 	in	every	day	,	every	kid	 work 	 s 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	live	 dash 	 board 	 	from	los	altos	school	 di 	 strict 	 	--	and	they	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 dash 	 board 	 	.
every	row	is	a	student	.
every	column	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
green	 mean 	 s 	 	the	student	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 profici 	 ent 	 	.
blue	 mean 	 s 	 	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	--	no	need	to	worry	.
red	 mean 	 s 	 	they	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
and	what	the	teacher	 do 	 es 	 	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	just	say	,	``	let	me	 inter 	 vene 	 	on	the	red	 kid 	 s 	 	.	``
or	even	better	,	``	let	me	get	one	of	the	green	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 profici 	 ent 	 	in	that	 con 	 cept 	 	to	be	the	first	line	of	attack	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	tutor	 the 	 ir 	 	peer	.	``
now	i	come	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	data	-	centric	 re 	 ality 	 	,	so	we	do	n't	want	that	teacher	to	even	go	and	 inter 	 vene 	 	and	have	to	ask	the	kid	awkward	 question 	 s 	 	:	``	oh	,	what	do	you	not	understand	?	``	or	``	what	do	you	do	understand	?	``
and	all	of	the	rest	.
so	our	paradigm	is	to	 re 	 ally 	 	arm	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	with	 a 	 s 	 	much	data	 a 	 s 	 	possible	--	 re 	 ally 	 	data	that	,	in	 al 	 most 	 	any	other	field	,	is	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	're	in	finance	or	 market 	 ing 	 	or	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	--	and	so	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 diagnos 	 e 	 	what	's	wrong	with	the	 student 	 s 	 	so	they	can	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	productive	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
so	now	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	 student 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	up	to	,	how	long	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	every	day	,	what	 video 	 s 	 	have	they	 be 	 en 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	when	did	they	pause	the	 video 	 s 	 	,	what	did	they	stop	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	what	 exercis 	 es 	 	are	they	using	,	what	have	they	 be 	 en 	 	focused	on	?
the	 out 	 er 	 	circle	 show 	 s 	 	what	 exercis 	 es 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	focused	on	.
the	inner	circle	 show 	 s 	 	the	 video 	 s 	 	they	're	focused	on	.
and	the	data	 get 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	granular	so	you	can	see	the	exact	 problem 	 s 	 	that	the	student	got	right	or	wrong	.
red	is	wrong	,	blue	is	right	.
the	 left 	 most 	 	question	is	the	first	question	that	the	student	 attempt 	 ed 	 	.
they	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	video	right	over	there	.
and	then	you	can	see	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	get	10	in	a	row	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	you	can	see	them	 learn 	 ing 	 	over	 t 	 hose 	 	last	10	 problem 	 s 	 	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	got	 fast 	 er 	 	.
the	height	is	how	long	it	took	them	.
so	when	you	talk	about	self	-	paced	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	sense	for	 every 	 one 	 	--	in	education	-	speak	,	 different 	 iated 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	--	but	it	's	kind	of	crazy	when	you	see	it	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	every	time	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	every	 class 	 room 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	if	you	go	five	 day 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	there	's	a	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	who	've	 rac 	 ed 	 	 a 	 head 	 	and	there	's	a	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	a	little	bit	 s 	 lower 	 	.
and	in	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	model	,	if	you	did	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	 assess 	 ment 	 	,	you	say	,	``	these	are	the	 gift 	 ed 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	these	are	the	 s 	 low 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	they	should	be	 track 	 ed 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	should	put	them	in	different	 class 	 es 	 	.	``
but	when	you	let	every	student	work	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	--	and	we	see	it	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	--	you	see	 student 	 s 	 	who	took	a	little	bit	[	of	]	extra	time	on	one	 con 	 cept 	 	or	the	other	,	but	once	they	get	through	that	 con 	 cept 	 	,	they	just	race	 a 	 head 	 	.
and	so	the	same	 kid 	 s 	 	that	you	thought	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 low 	 	six	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	you	now	would	think	are	 gift 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	it	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	it	 make 	 s 	 	you	 re 	 ally 	 	wonder	how	much	all	of	the	 label 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	a	lot	of	us	have	 benefit 	 ed 	 	from	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	just	due	to	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	of	time	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	 di 	 strict 	 	like	los	altos	,	our	goal	is	to	use	technology	to	 human 	 ize 	 	,	not	just	in	los	altos	,	but	on	a	global	scale	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	education	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	kind	of	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	point	.
a	lot	of	the	effort	in	 human 	 izing 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	is	focused	on	student	-	to	-	teacher	 ratio 	 s 	 	.
in	our	mind	,	the	relevant	metric	is	student	-	to	-	 valu 	 able 	 	-	human	-	time	-	with	-	the	-	teacher	ratio	.
so	in	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	model	,	most	of	the	teacher	's	time	is	 s 	 pent 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 lectur 	 es 	 	and	 grad 	 ing 	 	and	 what 	 not 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	five	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	 student 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	.
now	100	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	is	.
so	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	using	technology	,	not	just	 flip 	 ping 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	you	're	 human 	 izing 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	i	'd	 argu 	 e 	 	,	by	a	factor	of	five	or	10	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	is	in	los	altos	,	imagine	what	that	 do 	 es 	 	to	the	adult	 learn 	 er 	 	who	's	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	to	go	back	and	learn	stuff	that	they	should	have	before	,	before	going	back	to	college	.
imagine	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	to	a	street	kid	in	calcutta	who	 ha 	 s 	 	to	help	his	family	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	and	that	's	the	reason	why	he	or	she	ca	n't	go	to	school	.
now	they	can	 s 	 pend 	 	two	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	and	 re 	 mediate 	 	,	or	get	up	to	speed	and	not	feel	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	about	what	they	do	or	do	n't	know	.
now	imagine	what	 happen 	 s 	 	where	--	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 peer 	 s 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	each	other	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	 class 	 room 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	one	system	.
there	's	no	reason	why	you	ca	n't	have	that	peer	-	to	-	peer	 tutor 	 ing 	 	beyond	that	one	 class 	 room 	 	.
imagine	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	that	student	in	calcutta	all	of	a	sudden	can	tutor	your	son	,	or	your	son	can	tutor	that	kid	in	calcutta	?
and	i	think	what	you	'll	see	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	global	one	-	world	 class 	 room 	 	.
and	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	.
thank	you	.
bill	 gate 	 s 	 	:	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	some	 thing 	 s 	 	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	system	that	have	to	do	with	 motiv 	 ation 	 	and	 feed 	 back 	 	--	energy	 point 	 s 	 	,	merit	 badge 	 s 	 	.
tell	me	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	there	.
sk	:	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	.	no	,	we	have	an	awesome	team	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	.
and	i	have	to	make	it	clear	,	it	's	not	just	me	 any 	 more 	 	.
i	'm	still	 do 	 ing 	 	all	the	 video 	 s 	 	,	but	we	have	a	 rock 	 star 	 	team	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	've	put	a	bunch	of	game	 mechanic 	 s 	 	in	there	where	you	get	these	 badge 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	start	 hav 	 ing 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	 board 	 s 	 	by	area	,	and	you	get	 point 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
just	the	 word 	 ing 	 	of	the	 bad 	 ging 	 	or	how	 man 	 y 	 	 point 	 s 	 	you	get	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	we	see	on	a	system	-	wide	 bas 	 is 	 	,	like	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	fifth	graders	or	sixth	graders	going	one	direction	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	what	badge	you	give	them	.
bg	:	and	the	 collabor 	 ation 	 	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	los	altos	,	how	did	that	come	about	?
sk	:	los	altos	,	it	was	kind	of	crazy	.
once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	did	n't	expect	it	to	be	used	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	board	came	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	would	you	do	if	you	had	 cart 	 e 	 	blanche	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	would	just	,	every	student	work	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	on	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	we	'd	give	a	 dash 	 board 	 	.	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	radical	.	we	have	to	think	about	it	.	``
and	me	and	the	rest	of	the	team	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	they	're	never	going	to	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
but	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	next	day	they	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	can	you	start	in	two	 week 	 s 	 	?	``
bg	:	so	fifth	grade	math	is	where	that	's	going	on	right	now	?
sk	:	it	's	two	fifth	grade	 class 	 es 	 	and	two	 seven 	 th 	 	grade	 class 	 es 	 	.
and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	at	the	 di 	 strict 	 	level	.
i	think	what	they	're	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	is	they	can	now	follow	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	an	 on 	 ly 	 	-	in	-	school	thing	.
we	've	even	,	on	christmas	,	we	saw	some	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	we	can	track	 every 	 thing 	 	.
so	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	track	them	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	through	the	entire	 di 	 strict 	 	.
through	the	 summer 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	from	one	teacher	to	the	next	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 continu 	 ity 	 	of	data	that	even	at	the	 di 	 strict 	 	level	they	can	see	.
bg	:	so	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 view 	 s 	 	we	saw	 we 	 re 	 	for	the	teacher	to	go	in	and	track	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	's	going	on	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
so	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	teacher	 view 	 s 	 	to	see	what	they	think	they	mean	?
sk	:	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	.	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 spec 	 s 	 	by	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
we	made	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	for	 student 	 s 	 	so	they	could	see	 the 	 ir 	 	data	,	but	we	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tight	design	loop	with	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	they	're	 liter 	 ally 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	nice	,	but	...	``	like	that	focus	graph	,	a	lot	of	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	a	lot	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 jump 	 ing 	 	around	and	not	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	one	 top 	 ic 	 	.	``
so	we	made	that	focus	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
so	it	's	all	 be 	 en 	 	teacher	-	driven	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	crazy	.
bg	:	is	 th 	 is 	 	ready	for	prime	time	?
do	you	think	a	lot	of	 class 	 es 	 	next	school	year	should	try	 th 	 is 	 	thing	out	?
sk	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	ready	.
we	've	got	a	million	people	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	so	we	can	handle	a	few	more	.
no	,	no	reason	why	it	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	happen	in	every	 class 	 room 	 	in	america	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
bg	:	and	the	vision	of	the	 tutor 	 ing 	 	thing	.
the	idea	there	is	,	if	i	'm	 con 	 fused 	 	about	a	 top 	 ic 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	right	in	the	user	 inter 	 face 	 	i	'd	find	people	who	are	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	see	 the 	 ir 	 	reputation	,	and	i	could	schedule	and	connect	up	with	 t 	 hose 	 	people	?
sk	:	 absolute 	 ly 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	recommend	 every 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	to	do	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 dash 	 board 	 s 	 	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	have	,	you	can	go	log	in	right	now	and	you	can	 essential 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	coach	for	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	or	 nephew 	 s 	 	,	or	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	some	 kid 	 s 	 	at	the	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	club	.
and	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	can	start	 be 	 coming 	 	a	mentor	,	a	tutor	,	but	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	all	there	.
bg	:	well	,	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
i	think	you	just	got	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	the	future	of	education	.
thank	you	.
