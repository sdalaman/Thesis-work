we	are	 drown 	 ing 	 	in	news	.
reuters	 al 	 one 	 	 put 	 s 	 	out	three	and	a	half	million	news	 st 	 ories 	 	a	year	.
that	's	just	one	source	.
my	question	is	:	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	matter	in	the	long	run	?
that	's	the	idea	 be 	 hind 	 	the	long	news	.
it	's	a	project	by	the	long	now	 found 	 ation 	 	,	which	was	 found 	 ed 	 	by	tedsters	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	kevin	kelly	and	stewart	brand	.
and	what	we	're	looking	for	is	news	 st 	 ories 	 	that	might	still	matter	50	or	100	or	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	.
and	when	you	look	at	the	news	through	that	filter	,	a	lot	 fall 	 s 	 	by	the	 way 	 side 	 	.
to	take	the	top	 st 	 ories 	 	from	the	a.p	.	 th 	 is 	 	last	year	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	going	to	matter	in	a	decade	?
or	 th 	 is 	 	?
or	 th 	 is 	 	?
 re 	 ally 	 	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	going	to	matter	in	50	or	100	 year 	 s 	 	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	that	was	kind	of	cool	.
but	the	top	story	of	 th 	 is 	 	past	year	was	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	i	'm	just	 bet 	 ting 	 	that	,	 soon 	 er 	 	or	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 recess 	 ion 	 	is	going	to	be	old	news	.
so	,	what	kind	of	 st 	 ories 	 	might	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	for	the	future	?
well	,	let	's	take	science	.
 some 	 day 	 	,	little	 robot 	 s 	 	will	go	through	our	 blood 	 stream 	 s 	 	 fix 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
that	 some 	 day 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	here	if	you	're	a	mouse	.
some	 re 	 cent 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	:	 nano 	 bees 	 	zap	 tumor 	 s 	 	with	real	bee	venom	;	they	're	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	;	a	robot	they	built	that	can	crawl	through	the	human	body	.
what	about	 resource 	 s 	 	?	how	are	we	going	to	feed	nine	billion	people	?
we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	trouble	 feed 	 ing 	 	six	billion	 to 	 day 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	 yester 	 day 	 	,	there	's	over	a	billion	people	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
britain	will	 starv 	 e 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	.
bill	 gate 	 s 	 	,	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	bet	a	billion	on	[	 agricultur 	 al 	 	]	research	.
what	about	global	 politic 	 s 	 	?
the	world	's	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	different	when	and	if	 chin 	 a 	 	 set 	 s 	 	the	agenda	,	and	they	may	.
they	've	 over 	 taken 	 	the	u.s.	 a 	 s 	 	the	world	's	 big 	 gest 	 	car	market	,	they	've	 over 	 taken 	 	germany	 a 	 s 	 	the	largest	 export 	 er 	 	,	and	they	've	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	dna	 test 	 s 	 	on	 kid 	 s 	 	to	 choos 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 care 	 ers 	 	.
we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	ways	to	push	back	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	what	we	know	.
some	 re 	 cent 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	:	there	's	an	ant	 colon 	 y 	 	from	argentina	that	 ha 	 s 	 	now	spread	to	every	continent	but	antarctica	;	there	's	a	self	-	 direct 	 ed 	 	robot	scientist	that	's	made	a	 discover 	 y 	 	--	soon	,	science	may	no	 long 	 er 	 	need	us	,	and	life	may	no	 long 	 er 	 	need	us	either	;	a	 micro 	 be 	 	 wake 	 s 	 	up	after	120,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	with	or	 with 	 out 	 	us	,	life	will	go	on	.
but	my	pick	for	the	top	long	news	story	of	 th 	 is 	 	past	year	was	 th 	 is 	 	one	:	water	found	on	the	moon	.
 make 	 s 	 	it	a	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	put	a	 colon 	 y 	 	up	there	.
and	if	nasa	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	it	,	 chin 	 a 	 	might	,	or	 some 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	might	write	a	big	check	.
my	point	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	in	the	long	run	,	some	news	 st 	 ories 	 	are	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
