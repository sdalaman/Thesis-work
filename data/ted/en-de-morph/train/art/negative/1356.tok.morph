penelope	jagessar	chaffer	:	i	was	going	to	ask	if	there	's	a	doctor	in	the	house	.
no	,	i	'm	just	 jok 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	i	was	 pregn 	 ant 	 	with	my	first	child	that	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	the	most	 common 	 ly 	 	used	preservative	in	baby	care	 product 	 s 	 	 mimic 	 s 	 	estrogen	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	human	body	.
now	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	get	a	chemical	 com 	 pound 	 	from	 product 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	human	body	through	the	skin	.
and	these	 pre 	 serv 	 ative 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	found	in	breast	cancer	 tumor 	 s 	 	.
that	was	the	start	of	my	journey	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	film	,	``	toxic	baby	.	``
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	much	time	to	discover	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	issue	.
one	is	that	you	and	i	all	have	between	30	to	50,000	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	our	bodies	that	our	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	did	n't	have	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 chemical 	 s 	 	are	now	linked	to	the	 skyrocket 	 ing 	 	 incident 	 s 	 	of	chronic	 child 	 hood 	 	disease	that	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 industrial 	 ized 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	show	you	some	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	,	the	incidence	of	 child 	 hood 	 	leukemia	 ha 	 s 	 	 ris 	 en 	 	by	20	percent	just	in	a	generation	.
 ver 	 y 	 	similar	statistic	for	 child 	 hood 	 	cancer	in	the	u.s	.
in	canada	,	we	're	now	looking	at	one	in	10	canadian	children	with	asthma	.
that	's	a	four	-	fold	 in 	 crease 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	similar	story	around	the	world	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 astonish 	 ing 	 	statistic	is	a	600	percent	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 aut 	 ism 	 	and	 aut 	 istic 	 	spectrum	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	and	other	 learn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 abilities 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	that	trend	 a 	 cross 	 	europe	,	 a 	 cross 	 	north	america	.
and	in	europe	,	there	's	certain	 part 	 s 	 	of	europe	,	where	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	a	four	-	fold	 in 	 crease 	 	in	certain	genital	birth	 defect 	 s 	 	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	birth	 defect 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	200	percent	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	u.s	.
so	a	real	 skyrocket 	 ing 	 	of	chronic	 child 	 hood 	 	disease	that	 include 	 s 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 obes 	 ity 	 	and	juvenile	diabetes	,	 pre 	 mature 	 	puberty	.
so	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	for	me	,	when	i	'm	looking	for	 some 	 one 	 	who	can	 re 	 ally 	 	talk	to	me	and	talk	to	an	audience	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	people	in	the	world	who	can	discuss	 toxic 	 ity 	 	in	 bab 	 ies 	 	is	expert	in	 frog 	 s 	 	.
tyrone	hayes	:	it	was	a	surprise	to	me	 a 	 s 	 	well	that	i	would	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	,	that	i	'd	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	public	health	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	fact	,	i	never	thought	i	would	do	 any 	 thing 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
 frog 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	my	 involve 	 ment 	 	in	the	whole	 pest 	 icide 	 	issue	was	sort	of	a	surprise	 a 	 s 	 	well	when	i	was	 approach 	 ed 	 	by	the	largest	chemical	company	in	the	world	and	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	i	would	evaluate	how	atrazine	 affect 	 ed 	 	amphibians	,	or	my	 frog 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	atrazine	is	the	largest	selling	product	for	the	largest	chemical	company	in	the	world	.
it	's	the	number	one	 contami 	 nant 	 	of	 ground 	 water 	 	,	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	,	rain	water	.
in	2003	,	after	my	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	it	was	 bann 	 ed 	 	in	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	,	but	in	that	same	year	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	epa	re	-	 register 	 ed 	 	the	 com 	 pound 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	a	bit	 surprise 	 d 	 	when	we	found	out	that	when	we	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	 frog 	 s 	 	to	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 level 	 s 	 	of	atrazine	--	0.1	 part 	 s 	 	per	billion	--	that	it	 produce 	 d 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
these	are	the	dissected	 gon 	 ad 	 s 	 	of	an	animal	that	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 test 	 es 	 	,	two	 ov 	 aries 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	large	testis	,	more	 ov 	 aries 	 	,	which	is	not	normal	...
even	for	amphibians	.
in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	species	like	the	north	american	leopard	frog	 show 	 ed 	 	that	 male 	 s 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	atrazine	grew	 egg 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 test 	 es 	 	.
and	you	can	see	these	large	,	yolked	-	up	 egg 	 s 	 	 burst 	 ing 	 	through	the	surface	of	 th 	 is 	 	male	's	 test 	 es 	 	.
now	my	wife	 tell 	 s 	 	me	,	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	penelope	can	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	that	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	 pain 	 ful 	 	than	 child 	 birth 	 	--	which	that	i	'll	never	experience	,	i	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 argu 	 e 	 	that	--	but	i	would	guess	that	a	dozen	chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	in	my	testicle	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	top	five	.
in	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	we	've	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	we	've	 show 	 n 	 	that	some	of	these	 animal 	 s 	 	when	they	're	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	atrazine	,	some	of	the	 male 	 s 	 	grow	up	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 female 	 s 	 	.
so	these	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	two	 brother 	 s 	 	consummating	a	relationship	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	these	genetic	 male 	 s 	 	mate	with	other	 male 	 s 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	lay	 egg 	 s 	 	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	genetic	 male 	 s 	 	.
what	we	 pro 	 posed 	 	,	and	what	we	've	now	generated	support	for	,	is	that	what	atrazine	is	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 wreak 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 voc 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	a	hormone	 im 	 balance 	 	.
 normal 	 ly 	 	the	 test 	 es 	 	should	make	testosterone	,	the	male	hormone	.
but	what	atrazine	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 turn 	 s 	 	on	an	enzyme	,	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	if	you	will	,	aromatase	,	that	 convert 	 s 	 	testosterone	 in 	 to 	 	estrogen	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	these	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	 male 	 s 	 	lose	 the 	 ir 	 	testosterone	,	they	're	 chemical 	 ly 	 	castrated	,	and	they	're	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	feminized	 be 	 cause 	 	now	they	're	making	the	female	hormone	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 br 	 ought 	 	me	to	the	human	-	related	 issue 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	number	one	cancer	in	women	,	breast	cancer	,	is	 regulat 	 ed 	 	by	estrogen	and	by	 th 	 is 	 	enzyme	aromatase	.
so	when	you	develop	a	 cancer 	 ous 	 	cell	in	your	breast	,	aromatase	 convert 	 s 	 	androgens	 in 	 to 	 	 estrogen 	 s 	 	,	and	that	estrogen	 turn 	 s 	 	on	or	 promote 	 s 	 	the	growth	of	that	cancer	so	that	it	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	tumor	and	 spread 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	aromatase	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	in	breast	cancer	that	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	breast	cancer	is	a	chemical	 call 	 ed 	 	letrozole	,	which	 block 	 s 	 	aromatase	,	 block 	 s 	 	estrogen	,	so	that	if	you	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 mut 	 ated 	 	cell	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	grow	 in 	 to 	 	a	tumor	.
now	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	,	of	course	,	that	we	're	still	using	80	million	 pound 	 s 	 	of	atrazine	,	the	number	one	 contami 	 nant 	 	in	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	--	 turn 	 s 	 	on	aromatase	,	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	estrogen	and	 promote 	 s 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	in	 rat 	 s 	 	and	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 tumor 	 s 	 	,	breast	cancer	,	in	 human 	 s 	 	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	,	in	fact	,	the	same	company	that	 s 	 old 	 	us	80	million	 pound 	 s 	 	of	atrazine	,	the	breast	cancer	promoter	,	now	 sell 	 s 	 	us	the	blocker	--	the	exact	same	company	.
and	so	i	find	it	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 treat 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	disease	by	 prevent 	 ing 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	that	promote	it	,	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	respond	by	 put 	 ting 	 	more	 chemical 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	environment	.
pjc	:	so	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	estrogen	,	one	of	the	other	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	that	tyrone	 talk 	 s 	 	about	in	the	film	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	bisphenol	a	,	bpa	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	news	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	a	plasticizer	.
it	's	a	 com 	 pound 	 	that	's	found	in	polycarbonate	plastic	,	which	is	what	baby	 bottle 	 s 	 	are	made	out	of	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	bpa	is	that	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	potent	estrogen	that	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	once	 consider 	 ed 	 	for	use	 a 	 s 	 	a	synthetic	estrogen	in	hormone	placement	therapy	.
and	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	bpa	 le 	 ache 	 s 	 	from	 bab 	 ies 	 	'	 bottle 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	formula	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	milk	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
so	we	're	 do 	 s 	 ing 	 	our	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	our	 new 	 born 	 s 	 	,	our	 infant 	 s 	 	,	with	a	synthetic	estrogen	.
now	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	or	so	,	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	a	law	 bann 	 ing 	 	the	use	of	bpa	in	 bab 	 ies 	 	'	 bottle 	 s 	 	and	sippy	 cup 	 s 	 	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	not	 parent 	 s 	 	,	sippy	 cup 	 s 	 	are	 t 	 hose 	 	little	plastic	 thing 	 s 	 	that	your	child	 graduate 	 s 	 	to	after	using	 bottle 	 s 	 	.
but	just	two	 week 	 s 	 	before	that	,	the	u.s.	senate	 re 	 fused 	 	to	even	debate	the	 bann 	 ing 	 	of	bpa	in	 bab 	 ies 	 	'	 bottle 	 s 	 	and	sippy	 cup 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	you	 real 	 ize 	 	the	 on 	 us 	 	on	 parent 	 s 	 	to	have	to	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	 regulat 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	police	 th 	 is 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 live 	 s 	 	and	how	 astonish 	 ing 	 	that	is	.
pjc	:	with	 man 	 y 	 	plastic	baby	 bottle 	 s 	 	now	proven	to	leak	the	chemical	bisphenol	a	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 show 	 s 	 	how	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	is	 on 	 ly 	 	a	parent	's	 aware 	 ness 	 	that	 stand 	 s 	 	between	 chemical 	 s 	 	and	our	children	.
the	baby	bottle	scenario	 prove 	 s 	 	that	we	can	prevent	 un 	 necess 	 ary 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	if	we	 parent 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 aware 	 	,	we	are	 leav 	 ing 	 	our	children	to	 f 	 end 	 	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
th	:	and	what	penelope	 say 	 s 	 	here	is	even	more	true	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	know	,	we	're	in	the	middle	of	the	sixth	mass	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	agree	now	.
we	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	species	from	the	earth	 fast 	 er 	 	than	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	and	 lead 	 ing 	 	that	loss	are	amphibians	.
80	percent	of	all	amphibians	are	 threaten 	 ed 	 	and	in	come	decline	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	are	an	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	that	decline	.
in	part	,	amphibians	are	good	 indic 	 ators 	 	and	more	sensitive	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	 protect 	 ion 	 	from	 contami 	 nant 	 s 	 	in	the	water	--	no	eggshells	,	no	 membrane 	 s 	 	and	no	 place 	 nta 	 	.
in	fact	,	our	 invent 	 ion 	 	--	by	``	our	``	i	mean	we	 mammal 	 s 	 	--	one	of	our	big	 invent 	 ions 	 	was	the	 place 	 nta 	 	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	start	out	 a 	 s 	 	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	ancient	structure	that	 separat 	 es 	 	us	from	other	 animal 	 s 	 	,	the	 place 	 nta 	 	,	can	not	evolve	or	adapt	fast	 en 	 ough 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	rate	that	we	're	generating	new	 chemical 	 s 	 	that	it	's	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
the	evidence	of	that	is	that	 stud 	 ies 	 	in	 rat 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	with	atrazine	,	show	that	the	hormone	 im 	 balance 	 	atrazine	 generate 	 s 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	 abort 	 ion 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 maintain 	 ing 	 	a	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	is	dependent	on	 hormone 	 s 	 	.
of	 t 	 hose 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	abort	,	atrazine	 cause 	 s 	 	 pro 	 state 	 	disease	in	the	 pup 	 s 	 	so	the	 son 	 s 	 	are	born	with	an	old	man	's	disease	.
of	 t 	 hose 	 	that	do	n't	abort	,	atrazine	 cause 	 s 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	mammary	,	or	breast	,	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	the	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	 daughter 	 s 	 	in	 ut 	 ero 	 	,	so	that	 the 	 ir 	 	breast	do	n't	develop	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	when	 t 	 hose 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	grow	up	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 pup 	 s 	 	experience	 retard 	 ed 	 	growth	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	ca	n't	make	 en 	 ough 	 	milk	to	nourish	 the 	 ir 	 	 pup 	 s 	 	.
so	the	pup	you	see	on	the	bottom	is	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	atrazine	that	 it 	 s 	 	 grand 	 mother 	 	was	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	.
and	 give 	 n 	 	the	life	of	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	 generation 	 s 	 	,	 year 	 s 	 	,	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	right	now	are	 affect 	 ing 	 	the	health	of	our	 grand 	 children 	 	's	 grand 	 children 	 	by	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	environment	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	known	,	that	 chemical 	 s 	 	like	diethylstilbestrol	and	estrogen	,	pcbs	,	ddt	cross	the	 place 	 nta 	 	and	 effective 	 ly 	 	determine	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	breast	cancer	and	 obes 	 ity 	 	and	diabetes	 al 	 ready 	 	when	the	baby	's	in	the	womb	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	,	after	the	baby	's	born	,	our	other	 un 	 ique 	 	 invent 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 mammal 	 s 	 	is	that	we	nourish	our	 off 	 spring 	 	after	they	're	born	.
we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	that	 chemical 	 s 	 	like	ddt	and	 de 	 s 	 	and	atrazine	can	 al 	 so 	 	pass	over	 in 	 to 	 	milk	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 affect 	 ing 	 	our	 bab 	 ies 	 	even	after	 the 	 ir 	 	born	.
pjc	:	so	when	tyrone	 tell 	 s 	 	me	that	the	 place 	 nta 	 	is	an	ancient	organ	,	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	how	do	i	 demonst 	 rate 	 	that	?
how	do	you	show	that	?
and	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	when	you	make	a	film	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	science	that	there	's	no	 visual 	 ization 	 	for	.

pjc	:	and	 n 	 either 	 	had	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	before	i	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 th 	 is 	 	film	.
and	so	when	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 chemical 	 s 	 	can	pass	the	 place 	 nta 	 	and	go	 in 	 to 	 	your	 un 	 born 	 	child	,	it	made	me	start	to	think	,	what	would	my	fetus	say	to	me	?
what	would	our	 un 	 born 	 	children	say	to	us	when	they	have	an	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 every 	 day 	 	,	day	after	day	?

pjc	:	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	to	know	that	we	 a 	 s 	 	women	are	at	the	 van 	 guard 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	issue	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	collect	these	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	our	entire	life	and	then	we	end	up	 dump 	 ing 	 	it	and	 dump 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	our	 un 	 born 	 	children	.
we	are	in	effect	polluting	our	children	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	home	to	me	a	year	ago	when	i	found	out	i	was	 pregn 	 ant 	 	and	the	first	 s 	 can 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	that	my	baby	had	a	birth	defect	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	estrogenic	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	the	womb	and	the	second	 s 	 can 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	no	 heart 	 beat 	 	.
so	my	child	's	death	,	my	baby	's	death	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	home	the	 reson 	 ance 	 	of	what	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	in	 th 	 is 	 	film	.

and	so	when	tyrone	 talk 	 s 	 	about	the	fetus	 be 	 ing 	 	trapped	in	a	 contami 	 nated 	 	environment	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 contami 	 nated 	 	environment	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	toxic	baby	.
and	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	just	 pro 	 found 	 	and	 s 	 ad 	 	,	but	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	.
th	:	one	of	 th 	 is 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	and	appropriate	for	me	to	be	here	at	tedwomen	is	that	,	well	,	i	think	it	was	 summ 	 ed 	 	up	best	last	night	at	 d 	 inner 	 	when	 some 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	turn	to	the	man	at	your	table	and	tell	them	,	'	when	the	revolution	 start 	 s 	 	,	we	've	got	your	back	.	'	``	the	truth	is	,	women	,	you	've	had	our	back	on	 th 	 is 	 	issue	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	rachel	carson	's	``	silent	spring	``	to	theo	colborn	's	``	our	 stole 	 n 	 	future	``	to	sandra	steingraber	's	 book 	 s 	 	``	living	 down 	 stream 	 	``	and	``	 hav 	 ing 	 	faith	.	``
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	's	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	our	next	generation	--	like	my	wife	and	my	 beaut 	 iful 	 	daughter	here	about	13	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	's	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	women	 activist 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	area	.
but	for	the	men	here	,	i	want	to	say	it	's	not	just	women	and	children	that	are	at	risk	.
and	the	 frog 	 s 	 	that	are	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	atrazine	,	the	 test 	 es 	 	are	full	of	 hole 	 s 	 	and	 space 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	hormone	 im 	 balance 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 allow 	 ing 	 	 s 	 perm 	 	to	be	generated	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	testis	here	,	the	 test 	 icular 	 	tubules	end	up	empty	and	 fertil 	 ity 	 	 go 	 es 	 	down	by	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	50	percent	.
it	's	not	just	my	work	in	amphibians	,	but	similar	work	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	in	fish	in	europe	,	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	 test 	 es 	 	and	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 s 	 perm 	 	in	 reptil 	 es 	 	in	a	group	from	south	america	and	in	 rat 	 s 	 	,	an	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 s 	 perm 	 	in	the	 test 	 icular 	 	tubules	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	of	course	,	we	do	n't	do	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	but	just	by	 co 	 incidence 	 	,	my	 col 	 league 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	that	men	who	have	low	 s 	 perm 	 	count	,	low	 s 	 e 	 men 	 	quality	have	 significant 	 ly 	 	more	atrazine	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 urin 	 e 	 	.
these	are	just	men	who	live	in	an	 agricultur 	 al 	 	community	.
men	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	have	much	 high 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	of	atrazine	.
and	the	men	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 app 	 ly 	 	atrazine	have	even	more	atrazine	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 urin 	 e 	 	,	up	to	 level 	 s 	 	that	are	24,000	 time 	 s 	 	what	we	know	to	be	active	are	present	in	the	 urin 	 e 	 	of	these	men	.
of	course	,	most	of	them	,	90	percent	are	mexican	,	mexican	-	american	.
and	it	's	not	just	atrazine	they	're	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	.
they	're	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	 chemical 	 s 	 	like	chloropicrin	,	which	was	 original 	 ly 	 	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	nerve	gas	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 work 	 ers 	 	have	life	 expect 	 ancies 	 	of	 on 	 ly 	 	50	.
it	should	n't	come	to	any	surprise	that	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	happen	in	 wild 	 life 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	a	 war 	 ning 	 	to	us	,	just	like	rachel	carson	and	 other 	 s 	 	have	 war 	 ned 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	evident	in	 th 	 is 	 	slide	from	lake	nabugabo	in	uganda	,	the	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 run 	 off 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	crop	,	which	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 buck 	 et 	 s 	 	,	is	the	sole	source	of	 drink 	 ing 	 	,	 cook 	 ing 	 	and	 bath 	 ing 	 	water	for	 th 	 is 	 	village	.
now	if	i	told	the	men	in	 th 	 is 	 	village	that	the	 frog 	 s 	 	have	pour	 immun 	 e 	 	function	and	 egg 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 test 	 es 	 	,	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	 environment 	 al 	 	health	and	public	health	would	be	clear	.
you	would	not	drink	water	that	you	 k 	 new 	 	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	impact	on	the	 wild 	 life 	 	that	lived	in	it	.
the	problem	is	,	in	my	village	,	oakland	,	in	most	of	our	 village 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	see	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
we	turn	on	the	faucet	,	the	water	 come 	 s 	 	out	,	we	 assum 	 e 	 	it	's	safe	,	and	we	 assum 	 e 	 	that	we	are	 master 	 s 	 	of	our	environment	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 be 	 ing 	 	part	of	it	.
pjc	:	so	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	much	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 environment 	 al 	 	issue	.
and	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
we	know	so	much	about	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	and	climate	change	,	and	yet	,	we	have	no	 con 	 cept 	 	of	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	internal	 environment 	 al 	 ism 	 	.
we	know	what	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	out	there	,	we	have	a	sense	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 re 	 percuss 	 ions 	 	,	but	we	are	so	 ignor 	 ant 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	put	 thing 	 s 	 	,	or	 thing 	 s 	 	are	put	 in 	 to 	 	our	bodies	.
and	it	's	my	 feel 	 ing 	 	and	it	's	my	 ur 	 ging 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	here	to	know	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	women	move	forward	 a 	 s 	 	the	 communicator 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	carry	that	burden	of	 carry 	 ing 	 	the	children	,	 bear 	 ing 	 	the	children	,	we	hold	most	of	the	 buy 	 ing 	 	power	in	the	 house 	 hold 	 	,	is	that	it	's	going	to	be	us	moving	forward	to	carry	the	work	of	tyrone	and	other	 scientist 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
and	my	 ur 	 ging 	 	is	that	when	we	think	about	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	that	we	remember	that	it	's	not	just	about	 melt 	 ing 	 	 glaci 	 ers 	 	and	ice	 cap 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	about	our	children	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
thank	you	.
