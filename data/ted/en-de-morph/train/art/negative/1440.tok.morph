well	when	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	tedtalk	,	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 chuck 	 led 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	see	,	my	father	's	name	was	ted	,	and	much	of	my	life	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	my	musical	life	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	talk	that	i	'm	still	 hav 	 ing 	 	with	him	,	or	the	part	of	me	that	he	 continu 	 es 	 	to	be	.
now	ted	was	a	new	yorker	,	an	all	-	around	theater	guy	,	and	he	was	a	self	-	taught	 illustr 	 ator 	 	and	 music 	 ian 	 	.
he	did	n't	read	a	note	,	and	he	was	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
yet	,	he	was	my	 great 	 est 	 	teacher	.
 be 	 cause 	 	even	through	the	 squeak 	 s 	 	of	his	 hear 	 ing 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	,	his	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	music	was	 pro 	 found 	 	.
and	for	him	,	it	was	n't	so	much	the	way	the	music	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	about	what	it	 witness 	 es 	 	and	where	it	can	take	you	.
and	he	did	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	experience	,	which	he	 call 	 ed 	 	``	in	the	realm	of	music	.	``
now	ted	 enter 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	realm	every	day	by	 improv 	 is 	 ing 	 	in	a	sort	of	tin	pan	 al 	 ley 	 	style	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	he	was	tough	when	it	came	to	music	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	matter	in	music	:	what	and	how	.
and	the	thing	about	 classic 	 al 	 	music	,	that	what	and	how	,	it	's	 in 	 exhaust 	 ible 	 	.	``
that	was	his	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	the	music	.
both	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 d 	 	it	.
they	did	n't	know	all	that	much	about	it	,	but	they	 g 	 ave 	 	me	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	discover	it	together	with	them	.
and	i	think	inspired	by	that	 memor 	 y 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	my	 desir 	 e 	 	to	try	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	,	sort	of	pass	it	on	through	 what 	 ever 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
and	how	people	get	 th 	 is 	 	music	,	how	it	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 fascinate 	 s 	 	me	.
one	day	in	new	york	,	i	was	on	the	street	and	i	saw	some	 kid 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 base 	 ball 	 	between	stoops	and	 car 	 s 	 	and	fire	 hydrant 	 s 	 	.
and	a	tough	,	slouchy	kid	got	up	to	bat	,	and	he	took	a	 s 	 wing 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	he	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	ball	fly	for	a	second	,	and	then	he	went	,	``	dah	dadaratatatah	.
brah	dada	dadadadah	.	``
and	he	ran	around	the	 base 	 s 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	go	figure	.
how	did	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	18th	century	austrian	 aristoc 	 ratic 	 	 entertain 	 ment 	 	turn	 in 	 to 	 	the	 vict 	 ory 	 	crow	of	 th 	 is 	 	new	york	kid	?
how	was	that	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	?	how	did	he	get	to	hear	mozart	?
well	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 classic 	 al 	 	music	,	there	's	an	awful	lot	to	pass	on	,	much	more	than	mozart	,	beethoven	or	tchiakovsky	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 classic 	 al 	 	music	is	an	 un 	 broken 	 	living	tradition	that	 go 	 es 	 	back	over	1,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	every	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	had	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	and	 power 	 ful 	 	to	say	to	us	about	what	it	's	like	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	.
now	the	raw	material	of	it	,	of	course	,	is	just	the	music	of	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
it	's	all	the	anthems	and	dance	crazes	and	 ball 	 ad 	 s 	 	and	 march 	 es 	 	.
but	what	 classic 	 al 	 	music	 do 	 es 	 	is	to	distill	all	of	these	musics	down	,	to	 condens 	 e 	 	them	to	 the 	 ir 	 	absolute	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	and	from	that	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	create	a	new	language	,	a	language	that	 speak 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 loving 	 ly 	 	and	unflinchingly	about	who	we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	.
it	's	a	language	that	's	still	 evolv 	 ing 	 	.
now	over	the	centuries	it	grew	 in 	 to 	 	the	big	 piece 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ways 	 	think	of	,	like	 concert 	 os 	 	and	 sym 	 phon 	 ies 	 	,	but	even	the	most	 ambit 	 ious 	 	 master 	 piece 	 	can	have	 a 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	central	mission	to	 br 	 ing 	 	you	back	to	a	fragile	and	personal	moment	--	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	from	the	beethoven	 viol 	 in 	 	 concert 	 o 	 	.
it	's	so	simple	,	so	 e 	 voc 	 ative 	 	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	seem	to	be	 in 	 side 	 	of	it	.
yet	,	of	course	,	like	all	music	,	it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	not	about	 any 	 thing 	 	.
it	's	just	a	design	of	 pitch 	 es 	 	and	silence	and	time	.
and	the	 pitch 	 es 	 	,	the	 note 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	are	just	 vibration 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 location 	 s 	 	in	the	spectrum	of	sound	.
and	 whet 	 her 	 	we	call	them	440	per	second	,	a	,	or	3,729	,	b	flat	--	trust	me	,	that	's	right	--	they	're	just	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
but	the	way	we	react	to	different	 combination 	 s 	 	of	these	 phenomen 	 a 	 	is	complex	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	and	not	 total 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	.
and	the	way	we	react	to	them	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 radical 	 ly 	 	over	the	centuries	,	 a 	 s 	 	have	our	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	for	them	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	11th	century	,	people	 like 	 d 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	that	 end 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	in	the	17th	century	,	it	was	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	in	the	21st	century	...
now	your	21st	century	 ear 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	happy	with	 th 	 is 	 	last	 chor 	 d 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	a	while	back	it	would	have	 puzzl 	 ed 	 	or	 annoy 	 ed 	 	you	or	 s 	 ent 	 	some	of	you	running	from	the	room	.
and	the	reason	you	like	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	 inherit 	 ed 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	 k 	 new 	 	it	or	not	,	centuries	-	worth	of	 change 	 s 	 	in	musical	 theor 	 y 	 	,	practice	and	fashion	.
and	in	 classic 	 al 	 	music	we	can	follow	these	 change 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	music	's	 power 	 ful 	 	silent	partner	,	the	way	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	:	 not 	 ation 	 	.
now	the	impulse	to	notate	,	or	,	more	 exact 	 ly 	 	i	should	say	,	encode	music	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	with	us	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
in	200	b.c	.	,	a	man	named	sekulos	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	song	for	his	 depart 	 ed 	 	wife	and	 in 	 scribed 	 	it	on	her	gravestone	in	the	notational	system	of	the	greeks	.
and	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	impulse	to	notate	took	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	form	.
and	you	can	see	how	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	these	 excerpt 	 s 	 	from	the	christmas	mass	``	puer	natus	est	nobis	,	``	``	for	us	is	born	.	``
in	the	10th	century	,	little	 squigg 	 les 	 	 we 	 re 	 	used	just	to	 indic 	 ate 	 	the	general	shape	of	the	tune	.
and	in	the	12th	century	,	a	line	was	drawn	,	like	a	musical	horizon	line	,	to	better	 pin 	 point 	 	the	pitch	's	location	.
and	then	in	the	13th	century	,	more	lines	and	new	 shape 	 s 	 	of	 note 	 s 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	the	tune	 exact 	 ly 	 	,	and	that	led	to	the	kind	of	 not 	 ation 	 	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	.
well	 not 	 ation 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	music	on	,	notating	and	 en 	 cod 	 ing 	 	the	music	 change 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 prior 	 ities 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	enabled	the	 music 	 ians 	 	to	imagine	music	on	a	much	 vast 	 er 	 	scale	.
now	inspired	 move 	 s 	 	of	improvisation	could	be	 record 	 ed 	 	,	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	,	 consider 	 ed 	 	,	 priori 	 t 	 ized 	 	,	made	 in 	 to 	 	 intric 	 ate 	 	 design 	 s 	 	.
and	from	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	 classic 	 al 	 	music	 be 	 came 	 	what	it	most	 essential 	 ly 	 	is	,	a	 dial 	 ogue 	 	between	the	two	 power 	 ful 	 	 side 	 s 	 	of	our	nature	:	instinct	and	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
and	there	 beg 	 an 	 	to	be	a	real	 differ 	 ence 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	between	the	art	of	improvisation	and	the	art	of	 com 	 position 	 	.
now	an	 improv 	 is 	 er 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	and	 play 	 s 	 	the	next	cool	move	,	but	a	 compose 	 r 	 	is	 consider 	 ing 	 	all	possible	 move 	 s 	 	,	 test 	 ing 	 	them	out	,	 priori 	 tizing 	 	them	out	,	 un 	 til 	 	he	 s 	 ees 	 	how	they	can	form	a	 power 	 ful 	 	and	 cohere 	 nt 	 	design	of	ultimate	and	 endur 	 ing 	 	 cool 	 ness 	 	.
now	some	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 compose 	 rs 	 	,	like	bach	,	 we 	 re 	 	 combination 	 s 	 	of	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
bach	was	like	a	great	 improv 	 is 	 er 	 	with	a	mind	of	a	 ches 	 s 	 	master	.
mozart	was	the	same	way	.
but	every	 music 	 ian 	 	 strike 	 s 	 	a	different	balance	between	faith	and	reason	,	instinct	and	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
and	every	musical	era	had	different	 prior 	 ities 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	different	 thing 	 s 	 	to	pass	on	,	different	'	 what 	 s 	 	'	and	'	hows	'	.
so	in	the	first	eight	centuries	or	so	of	 th 	 is 	 	tradition	the	big	'	what	'	was	to	praise	god	.
and	by	the	1400s	,	music	was	 be 	 ing 	 	written	that	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	mirror	god	's	mind	 a 	 s 	 	could	be	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	design	of	the	night	sky	.
the	'	how	'	was	a	style	 call 	 ed 	 	polyphony	,	music	of	 man 	 y 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	moving	 voice 	 s 	 	that	 suggest 	 ed 	 	the	way	the	 planet 	 s 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	move	in	ptolemy	's	geocentric	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 tru 	 ly 	 	the	music	of	the	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	music	that	leonardo	davinci	would	have	known	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	tremendous	intellectual	 perfect 	 ion 	 	and	 s 	 er 	 en 	 ity 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	new	had	to	happen	--	a	radical	new	move	,	which	in	1600	is	what	did	happen	.
 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	:	ah	,	bitter	blow	!
ah	,	 wick 	 ed 	 	,	cruel	fate	!
ah	,	baleful	 star 	 s 	 	!
ah	,	avaricious	heaven	!
mtt	:	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	was	the	birth	of	opera	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	put	music	on	a	radical	new	course	.
the	what	now	was	not	to	mirror	the	mind	of	god	,	but	to	follow	the	emotion	 turbul 	 ence 	 	of	man	.
and	the	how	was	 harmon 	 y 	 	,	 stack 	 ing 	 	up	the	 pitch 	 es 	 	to	form	 chor 	 d 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 chor 	 d 	 s 	 	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	 we 	 re 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 represent 	 ing 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 varie 	 ties 	 	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 chor 	 d 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	still	have	with	us	,	the	triads	,	either	the	major	one	,	which	we	think	is	happy	,	or	the	minor	one	,	which	we	perceive	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	.
but	what	's	the	actual	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	these	two	 chor 	 d 	 s 	 	?
it	's	just	these	two	 note 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	.
it	's	either	e	natural	,	and	659	 vibration 	 s 	 	per	second	,	or	e	flat	,	at	622	.
so	the	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	human	happiness	and	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	?
37	 freak 	 in 	 	'	 vibration 	 s 	 	.
so	you	can	see	in	a	system	like	 th 	 is 	 	there	was	enormous	subtle	potential	of	 represent 	 ing 	 	human	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	 a 	 s 	 	man	 beg 	 an 	 	to	understand	more	his	complex	and	 ambi 	 valent 	 	nature	,	 harmon 	 y 	 	grew	more	complex	to	reflect	it	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	was	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 express 	 ing 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	beyond	the	ability	of	 word 	 s 	 	.
now	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	,	 classic 	 al 	 	music	 re 	 ally 	 	took	off	.
it	's	the	time	in	which	the	big	 form 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	arise	.
and	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	technology	 beg 	 an 	 	to	be	felt	 al 	 so 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 print 	 ing 	 	put	music	,	the	 score 	 s 	 	,	the	codebooks	of	music	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 perform 	 ers 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	new	and	 improv 	 ed 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	made	the	age	of	the	 virtuos 	 o 	 	possible	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	when	 t 	 hose 	 	big	 form 	 s 	 	 a 	 rose 	 	--	the	 sym 	 phon 	 ies 	 	,	the	sonatas	,	the	 concert 	 os 	 	.
and	in	these	big	 architect 	 ures 	 	of	time	,	 compose 	 rs 	 	like	beethoven	could	share	the	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	of	a	 life 	 time 	 	.
a	piece	like	beethoven	's	fifth	 bas 	 ically 	 	 witness 	 ing 	 	how	it	was	possible	for	him	to	go	from	sorrow	and	anger	,	over	the	course	of	a	half	an	hour	,	step	by	 exact 	 ing 	 	step	of	his	route	,	to	the	moment	when	he	could	make	it	 a 	 cross 	 	to	joy	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	the	 sym 	 phony 	 	could	be	used	for	more	complex	 issue 	 s 	 	,	like	 grip 	 ping 	 	 one 	 s 	 	of	culture	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 national 	 ism 	 	or	quest	for	 free 	 dom 	 	or	the	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	of	 sensual 	 ity 	 	.
but	 what 	 ever 	 	direction	the	music	took	,	one	thing	 un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	was	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	,	and	that	was	when	the	 music 	 ians 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	,	the	music	 stop 	 ped 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	moment	so	 fascinate 	 s 	 	me	.
i	find	it	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	one	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	the	music	 stop 	 s 	 	?
where	 do 	 es 	 	it	go	?	what	's	left	?
what	 stick 	 s 	 	with	people	in	the	audience	at	the	end	of	a	performance	?
is	it	a	 melo 	 dy 	 	or	a	rhythm	or	a	mood	or	an	attitude	?
and	how	might	that	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	?
to	me	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 intima 	 te 	 	,	personal	side	of	music	.
it	's	the	 pass 	 ing 	 	on	part	.	it	's	the	'	why	'	part	of	it	.
and	to	me	that	's	the	most	essential	of	all	.
 most 	 ly 	 	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	person	-	to	-	person	thing	,	a	teacher	-	student	,	 perform 	 er 	 	-	audience	thing	,	and	then	around	1880	came	 th 	 is 	 	new	technology	that	first	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	then	through	 analog 	 s 	 	then	 digital 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	new	and	 miracul 	 ous 	 	way	of	 pass 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	,	albeit	an	 imperson 	 al 	 	one	.
people	could	now	hear	music	all	the	time	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	n't	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	them	to	play	an	instrument	,	read	music	or	even	go	to	 concert 	 s 	 	.
and	technology	 democrat 	 ized 	 	music	by	making	 every 	 thing 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
it	 spear 	 headed 	 	a	cultural	revolution	in	which	 artist 	 s 	 	like	caruso	and	bessie	smith	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	same	 foot 	 ing 	 	.
and	technology	 push 	 ed 	 	 compose 	 rs 	 	to	tremendous	 extrem 	 es 	 	,	using	 computer 	 s 	 	and	 synthesize 	 rs 	 	to	create	 work 	 s 	 	of	 intellectual 	 ly 	 	 impenetr 	 able 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	beyond	the	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 perform 	 ers 	 	and	 audience 	 s 	 	.
at	the	same	time	technology	,	by	taking	over	the	role	that	 not 	 ation 	 	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	,	 shift 	 ed 	 	the	balance	 with 	 in 	 	music	between	instinct	and	 intellig 	 ence 	 	way	over	to	the	 instinct 	 ive 	 	side	.
the	culture	in	which	we	live	now	is	awash	with	music	of	improvisation	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 slice 	 d 	 	,	diced	,	 layer 	 ed 	 	and	,	god	 know 	 s 	 	,	 distribut 	 ed 	 	and	 s 	 old 	 	.
what	's	the	long	-	term	effect	of	 th 	 is 	 	on	us	or	on	music	?
 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	.
the	question	 remain 	 s 	 	:	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	the	music	 stop 	 s 	 	?
what	 stick 	 s 	 	with	people	?
now	that	we	have	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	access	to	music	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	stick	with	us	?
well	let	me	show	you	a	story	of	what	i	mean	by	``	 re 	 ally 	 	 stick 	 ing 	 	with	us	.	``
i	was	 visit 	 ing 	 	a	cousin	of	mine	in	an	old	age	home	,	and	i	spied	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 sha 	 ky 	 	old	man	making	his	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	room	on	a	 walk 	 er 	 	.

and	i	thought	,	my	god	,	how	much	must	 th 	 is 	 	music	mean	to	 th 	 is 	 	man	that	he	would	get	 him 	 self 	 	out	of	his	bed	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	room	to	 re 	 cover 	 	the	 memor 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	music	that	,	after	 every 	 thing 	 	else	in	his	life	is	sloughing	away	,	still	 mean 	 s 	 	so	much	to	him	?
well	,	that	's	why	i	take	every	performance	so	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	why	it	 matter 	 s 	 	to	me	so	much	.
i	never	know	who	might	be	there	,	who	might	be	 absorb 	 ing 	 	it	and	what	will	happen	to	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
but	now	i	'm	 excit 	 ed 	 	that	there	's	more	chance	than	ever	before	possible	of	sharing	 th 	 is 	 	music	.
that	's	what	 drive 	 s 	 	my	interest	in	 project 	 s 	 	like	the	tv	 s 	 eries 	 	``	 keep 	 ing 	 	score	``	with	the	san	francisco	 sym 	 phony 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	backstories	of	music	,	and	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	young	 music 	 ians 	 	at	the	new	world	 sym 	 phony 	 	on	 project 	 s 	 	that	explore	the	potential	of	the	new	 perform 	 ing 	 	 art 	 s 	 	 center 	 s 	 	for	both	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	education	.
and	of	course	,	the	new	world	 sym 	 phony 	 	led	to	the	youtube	 sym 	 phony 	 	and	 project 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	that	reach	out	to	 music 	 ians 	 	and	 audience 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	.
and	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	is	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	prototype	.
there	's	just	a	role	here	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	--	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 perform 	 ers 	 	--	to	be	 explore 	 rs 	 	together	.
 s 	 ure 	 	,	the	big	 event 	 s 	 	attract	a	lot	of	attention	,	but	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	is	what	 go 	 es 	 	on	every	single	day	.
we	need	your	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	your	curiosity	,	your	 voice 	 s 	 	.
