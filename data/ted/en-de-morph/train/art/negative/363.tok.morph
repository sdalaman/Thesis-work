so	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	i	have	 s 	 pent 	 	my	life	looking	 in 	 to 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 pre 	 sidents 	 	who	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
 wa 	 king 	 	up	with	abraham	lincoln	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 think 	 ing 	 	of	franklin	roosevelt	when	i	went	to	bed	at	night	.
but	when	i	try	and	think	about	what	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	the	meaning	in	life	,	my	mind	 keep 	 s 	 	 wander 	 ing 	 	back	to	a	 semi 	 nar 	 	that	i	took	when	i	was	a	graduate	student	at	harvard	with	the	great	 psycho 	 logist 	 	erik	erikson	.
he	taught	us	that	the	 rich 	 est 	 	and	 full 	 est 	 	 live 	 s 	 	attempt	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	an	inner	balance	between	three	 realm 	 s 	 	:	work	,	love	and	play	.
and	that	to	pursue	one	realm	to	the	 dis 	 regard 	 	of	the	other	,	is	to	open	 one 	 self 	 	to	ultimate	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	in	 old 	 er 	 	age	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	to	pursue	all	three	with	equal	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	,	is	to	make	possible	a	life	 fill 	 ed 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	with	 achiev 	 ement 	 	,	but	with	 s 	 er 	 en 	 ity 	 	.
so	since	i	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	,	let	me	look	back	on	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	two	of	the	 pre 	 sidents 	 	i	've	 stud 	 ied 	 	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	point	--	abraham	lincoln	and	lyndon	johnson	.
 a 	 s 	 	for	that	first	sphere	of	work	,	i	think	what	abraham	lincoln	's	life	 suggest 	 s 	 	is	that	fierce	 ambit 	 ion 	 	is	a	good	thing	.
he	had	a	huge	 ambit 	 ion 	 	.
but	it	was	n't	 simpl 	 y 	 	for	 off 	 ice 	 	or	power	or	 celebr 	 ity 	 	or	fame	--	what	it	was	for	was	to	accomplish	 some 	 thing 	 	worthy	 en 	 ough 	 	in	life	so	that	he	could	make	the	world	a	little	better	place	for	his	 hav 	 ing 	 	lived	in	it	.
even	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	,	lincoln	 dream 	 ed 	 	 hero 	 ic 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	.
he	 some 	 how 	 	had	to	 es 	 cape 	 	that	hard	-	scrabble	farm	from	which	he	was	born	.
no	 school 	 ing 	 	was	possible	for	him	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	here	,	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	there	.
but	he	read	 book 	 s 	 	in	every	spare	moment	he	could	find	.
it	was	 s 	 aid 	 	when	he	got	a	copy	of	the	king	james	 b 	 ible 	 	or	``	aesop	's	fables	,	``	he	was	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	he	could	n't	sleep	.
he	could	n't	eat	.
the	great	poet	emily	dickinson	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	is	no	frigate	like	a	book	to	take	us	 land 	 s 	 	away	.	``
how	true	for	lincoln	.
 th 	 ough 	 	he	never	would	travel	to	europe	,	he	went	with	shakespeare	's	 king 	 s 	 	to	merry	england	,	he	went	with	lord	byron	's	 poet 	 ry 	 	to	spain	and	portugal	.
 liter 	 ature 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	him	to	transcend	his	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
but	there	 we 	 re 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	in	his	early	life	that	he	was	 haunt 	 ed 	 	by	death	.
his	mother	 di 	 ed 	 	when	he	was	 on 	 ly 	 	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	;	his	 on 	 ly 	 	sister	,	sarah	,	in	 child 	 birth 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	;	and	his	first	love	,	ann	rutledge	,	at	the	age	of	22	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	when	his	mother	lay	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	she	did	not	hold	out	for	him	the	hope	that	they	would	meet	in	an	afterworld	.
she	 simpl 	 y 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	``	abraham	,	i	'm	going	away	from	you	now	,	and	i	 s 	 hall 	 	never	return	.	``
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	he	 be 	 came 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	the	thought	that	when	we	die	our	life	is	 s 	 wept 	 	away	--	dust	to	dust	.
but	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	he	grew	 old 	 er 	 	did	he	develop	a	certain	 consol 	 ation 	 	from	an	ancient	greek	 not 	 ion 	 	--	but	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	other	 culture 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	--	that	if	you	could	accomplish	 some 	 thing 	 	worthy	in	your	life	,	you	could	live	on	in	the	 memor 	 y 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
your	honor	and	your	reputation	would	 out 	 live 	 	your	 earth 	 ly 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
and	that	worthy	 ambit 	 ion 	 	 be 	 came 	 	his	lodestar	.
it	carried	him	through	the	one	significant	 depress 	 ion 	 	that	he	 suffer 	 ed 	 	when	he	was	in	his	early	30s	.
three	 thing 	 s 	 	had	 combine 	 d 	 	to	lay	him	low	.
he	had	broken	his	 engage 	 ment 	 	with	mary	todd	,	not	certain	he	was	ready	to	marry	her	,	but	 know 	 ing 	 	how	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	it	was	to	her	that	he	did	that	.
his	one	 intima 	 te 	 	friend	,	joshua	speed	,	was	 leav 	 ing 	 	illinois	to	go	back	to	kentucky	 be 	 cause 	 	speed	's	father	had	 di 	 ed 	 	.
and	his	 politic 	 al 	 	 care 	 er 	 	in	the	state	 legisl 	 ature 	 	was	on	a	 down 	 ward 	 	slide	.
he	was	so	 depress 	 ed 	 	that	 friend 	 s 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	he	was	 sui 	 cidal 	 	.
they	took	all	knives	and	 razor 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	from	his	room	.
and	his	great	friend	speed	went	to	his	side	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	lincoln	,	you	must	 r 	 ally 	 	or	you	will	die	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	i	would	just	 a 	 s 	 	soon	die	right	now	,	but	i	've	not	yet	 d 	 one 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	to	make	any	human	 be 	 ing 	 	remember	that	i	have	lived	.	``
so	 fuel 	 ed 	 	by	that	 ambit 	 ion 	 	,	he	 return 	 ed 	 	to	the	state	 legisl 	 ature 	 	.
he	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	won	a	seat	in	congress	.
he	then	ran	twice	for	the	senate	,	lost	twice	.
``	 every 	 one 	 	is	broken	by	life	,	``	ernest	hemingway	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	some	people	are	 strong 	 er 	 	in	the	broken	 place 	 s 	 	.	``
so	then	he	 surprise 	 d 	 	the	nation	with	an	 up 	 set 	 	 vict 	 ory 	 	for	the	 pre 	 side 	 ncy 	 	over	three	far	more	 experience 	 d 	 	,	far	more	educated	,	far	more	 celebr 	 ated 	 	 rival 	 s 	 	.
and	then	when	he	won	the	general	election	,	he	 stunn 	 ed 	 	the	nation	even	more	by	appointing	each	of	these	three	 rival 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	cabinet	.
it	was	an	unprecedented	act	at	the	time	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	thought	,	``	he	'll	look	like	a	figurehead	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	these	people	.	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	lincoln	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	these	are	the	 strong 	 est 	 	and	most	able	men	in	the	country	.
the	country	is	in	peril	.	i	need	them	by	my	side	.	``
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	my	old	friend	lyndon	johnson	might	have	put	it	in	less	noble	fashion	:	``	better	to	have	your	 ene 	 mies 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	tent	pissing	out	,	than	 out 	 side 	 	the	tent	pissing	in	.	``
but	it	soon	 be 	 came 	 	clear	that	abraham	lincoln	would	emerge	 a 	 s 	 	the	 un 	 disput 	 ed 	 	 cap 	 tain 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 ru 	 ly 	 	team	.
for	each	of	them	soon	came	to	understand	that	he	 possess 	 ed 	 	an	 un 	 parallel 	 ed 	 	array	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	 strength 	 s 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	that	 prov 	 ed 	 	far	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	the	thinness	of	his	external	résumé	.
for	one	thing	,	he	 possess 	 ed 	 	an	 un 	 can 	 ny 	 	ability	to	 empath 	 ize 	 	with	and	to	think	about	other	 people 	 s 	 	'	point	of	view	.
he	 repair 	 ed 	 	 inju 	 red 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	might	have	 escal 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	permanent	 hostil 	 ity 	 	.
he	 share 	 d 	 	credit	with	ease	,	 assum 	 ed 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	the	failure	of	his	subordinates	,	 constant 	 ly 	 	 acknowledg 	 ed 	 	his	 error 	 s 	 	and	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	his	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
these	are	the	 qual 	 ities 	 	we	should	be	looking	for	in	our	 candid 	 ates 	 	in	2008	.
he	 re 	 fused 	 	to	be	 provok 	 ed 	 	by	 pet 	 ty 	 	 griev 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
he	never	 submit 	 ted 	 	to	 jealous 	 y 	 	or	brooded	over	 perceive 	 d 	 	slights	.
and	he	 express 	 ed 	 	his	 un 	 shake 	 able 	 	 convict 	 ions 	 	in	 every 	 day 	 	language	,	in	 metaphor 	 s 	 	,	in	 st 	 ories 	 	.
and	with	a	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	language	--	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	shakespeare	and	the	 poet 	 ry 	 	he	had	so	 love 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	had	 work 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	way	 in 	 to 	 	his	 ver 	 y 	 	soul	.
in	1863	,	when	the	 emancip 	 ation 	 	 pro 	 clam 	 ation 	 	was	 sign 	 ed 	 	,	he	 br 	 ought 	 	his	old	friend	,	joshua	speed	,	back	to	the	white	house	,	and	 remember 	 ed 	 	that	conversation	of	 decade 	 s 	 	before	,	when	he	was	so	 s 	 ad 	 	.
and	he	,	 point 	 ing 	 	to	the	 pro 	 clam 	 ation 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	measure	,	my	fondest	 hope 	 s 	 	will	be	 real 	 ized 	 	.	``
but	 a 	 s 	 	he	was	about	to	put	his	signature	on	the	 pro 	 clam 	 ation 	 	his	own	hand	was	numb	and	 sha 	 king 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	had	shaken	a	thousand	 hand 	 s 	 	that	 morn 	 ing 	 	at	a	new	year	's	 re 	 ception 	 	.
so	he	put	the	pen	down	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	ever	my	soul	 we 	 re 	 	in	an	act	,	it	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	act	.
but	if	i	sign	with	a	 sha 	 king 	 	hand	,	posterity	will	say	,	'	he	 hesit 	 ated 	 	.	'	``	so	he	 wait 	 ed 	 	 un 	 til 	 	he	could	take	up	the	pen	and	sign	with	a	bold	and	clear	hand	.
but	even	in	his	 wild 	 est 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	,	lincoln	could	never	have	 imagin 	 ed 	 	how	far	his	reputation	would	reach	.
i	was	so	 thrill 	 ed 	 	to	find	an	interview	with	the	great	russian	writer	,	leo	tolstoy	,	in	a	new	york	 news 	 paper 	 	in	the	early	1900s	.
and	in	it	,	tolstoy	told	of	a	trip	that	he	'd	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	made	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	remote	area	of	the	caucasus	,	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	wild	barbarians	,	who	had	never	left	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	russia	.
 know 	 ing 	 	that	tolstoy	was	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 mid 	 st 	 	,	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	to	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	of	the	great	men	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	told	them	about	napoleon	and	alexander	the	great	and	frederick	the	great	and	julius	caesar	,	and	they	 love 	 d 	 	it	.
but	before	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	the	chief	of	the	barbarians	stood	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	'	but	wait	,	you	have	n't	told	us	about	the	 great 	 est 	 	 rul 	 er 	 	of	them	all	.
we	want	to	hear	about	that	man	who	spoke	with	a	voice	of	thunder	,	who	 laugh 	 ed 	 	like	the	 s 	 un 	 rise 	 	,	who	came	from	that	place	 call 	 ed 	 	america	,	which	is	so	far	from	here	,	that	if	a	young	man	should	travel	there	,	he	would	be	an	old	man	when	he	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
tell	us	of	that	man	.	tell	us	of	abraham	lincoln	.	'	``	he	was	 stunn 	 ed 	 	.
he	told	them	 every 	 thing 	 	he	could	about	lincoln	.
and	then	in	the	interview	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	made	lincoln	so	great	?
not	 a 	 s 	 	great	a	general	 a 	 s 	 	napoleon	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	great	a	 state 	 s 	 man 	 	 a 	 s 	 	frederick	the	great	.	``
but	his	 great 	 ness 	 	 consist 	 ed 	 	,	and	 historian 	 s 	 	would	roundly	agree	,	in	the	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	of	his	character	and	the	moral	fiber	of	his	 be 	 ing 	 	.
so	in	the	end	that	 power 	 ful 	 	 ambit 	 ion 	 	that	had	carried	lincoln	through	his	 b 	 leak 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	.
that	 ambit 	 ion 	 	that	had	 allow 	 ed 	 	him	to	 labor 	 iously 	 	 educ 	 ate 	 	 him 	 self 	 	by	 him 	 self 	 	,	to	go	through	that	string	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	and	the	 dark 	 est 	 	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	war	.
his	story	would	be	told	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	for	that	second	sphere	,	not	of	work	,	but	of	love	--	 en 	 compass 	 ing 	 	family	,	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	--	it	,	too	,	 take 	 s 	 	work	and	 commit 	 ment 	 	.
the	lyndon	johnson	that	i	saw	in	the	last	 year 	 s 	 	of	his	life	,	when	i	 help 	 ed 	 	him	on	his	 memoir 	 s 	 	,	was	a	man	who	had	 s 	 pent 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	work	,	power	and	individual	success	,	that	he	had	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 psych 	 ic 	 	or	 emotion 	 al 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	left	to	get	him	through	the	 day 	 s 	 	once	the	 pre 	 side 	 ncy 	 	was	gone	.
my	relationship	with	him	 beg 	 an 	 	on	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	level	.
i	was	 select 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	white	house	fellow	when	i	was	24	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
we	had	a	big	dance	at	the	white	house	.
 p 	 resident 	 	johnson	did	dance	with	me	that	night	.
not	that	peculiar	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	three	women	out	of	the	16	white	house	 fellow 	 s 	 	.
but	he	did	whisper	in	my	ear	that	he	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	work	 direct 	 ly 	 	for	him	in	the	white	house	.
but	it	was	not	to	be	that	simple	.
for	in	the	 month 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	up	to	my	 s 	 election 	 	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	young	people	,	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	active	in	the	anti	-	vietnam	war	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	had	written	an	article	against	lyndon	johnson	,	which	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	came	out	in	the	new	 re 	 public 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	after	the	dance	in	the	white	house	.
and	the	theme	of	the	article	was	how	to	 re 	 move 	 	lyndon	johnson	from	power	.
so	i	was	certain	he	would	kick	me	out	of	the	program	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	,	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	 br 	 ing 	 	her	down	here	for	a	year	,	and	if	i	ca	n't	win	her	over	,	no	one	can	.	``
so	i	did	end	up	 work 	 ing 	 	for	him	in	the	white	house	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 accompani 	 ed 	 	him	to	his	ranch	to	help	him	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 memoir 	 s 	 	,	never	fully	 understand 	 ing 	 	why	he	'd	 chose 	 n 	 	me	to	 s 	 pend 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	with	.
i	like	to	 believ 	 e 	 	it	was	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	a	good	 listen 	 er 	 	.
he	was	a	great	 story 	 teller 	 	.
fabulous	,	 color 	 ful 	 	,	anecdotal	 st 	 ories 	 	.
there	was	a	problem	with	these	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	which	i	 lat 	 er 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	which	is	that	half	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	n't	true	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	,	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	.
so	i	think	that	part	of	his	 attract 	 ion 	 	for	me	was	that	i	 love 	 d 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	his	tall	 tale 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	part	of	it	was	that	i	was	then	a	young	woman	.
and	he	had	 some 	 what 	 	of	a	minor	league	womanizing	reputation	.
so	i	 constant 	 ly 	 	 chat 	 ted 	 	to	him	about	 boyfriend 	 s 	 	,	even	when	i	did	n't	have	any	at	all	.
 every 	 thing 	 	was	 work 	 ing 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	one	day	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	discuss	our	relationship	.
 sound 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	ominous	when	he	took	me	 near 	 by 	 	to	the	lake	,	 convenient 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	lake	lyndon	baines	johnson	.
and	there	was	wine	and	cheese	and	a	red	-	 check 	 ed 	 	 table 	 cloth 	 	--	all	the	romantic	 trapping 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 start 	 ed 	 	out	,	``	doris	,	more	than	any	other	woman	i	have	ever	known	...	``	and	my	heart	 s 	 an 	 k 	 	.
and	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	 re 	 mind 	 	me	of	my	mother	.	``
it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	what	was	going	on	in	my	mind	.
but	i	must	say	,	the	 old 	 er 	 	i	've	gotten	,	the	more	i	 real 	 ize 	 	what	an	 in 	 credible 	 	privilege	it	was	to	have	 s 	 pent 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	aging	lion	of	a	man	.
a	victor	in	a	thousand	 contest 	 s 	 	,	three	great	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 law 	 s 	 	,	medicare	,	aid	to	education	.
and	yet	,	roundly	 defeat 	 ed 	 	in	the	end	by	the	war	in	vietnam	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	so	 s 	 ad 	 	and	so	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	he	 open 	 ed 	 	up	to	me	in	ways	he	never	would	have	had	i	known	him	at	the	height	of	his	power	--	sharing	his	 fear 	 s 	 	,	his	 sorrow 	 s 	 	and	his	 worri 	 es 	 	.
and	i	'd	like	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	privilege	 fire 	 d 	 	 with 	 in 	 	me	the	drive	to	understand	the	inner	person	 be 	 hind 	 	the	public	figure	,	that	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	to	each	of	my	 book 	 s 	 	since	then	.
but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	home	to	me	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	which	erik	erikson	had	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	instill	in	all	of	us	about	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 find 	 ing 	 	balance	in	life	.
for	on	the	surface	,	lyndon	johnson	should	have	had	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	world	to	feel	good	about	in	 t 	 hose 	 	last	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	the	sense	that	he	had	 be 	 en 	 	 elect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 pre 	 side 	 ncy 	 	;	he	had	all	the	money	he	 need 	 ed 	 	to	pursue	any	leisure	activity	he	 want 	 ed 	 	;	he	owned	a	 sp 	 acious 	 	ranch	in	the	 country 	 side 	 	,	a	 pent 	 house 	 	in	the	city	,	 sail 	 boat 	 s 	 	,	speedboats	.
he	had	 serv 	 ants 	 	to	answer	any	whim	,	and	he	had	a	family	who	 love 	 d 	 	him	 deep 	 ly 	 	.
and	yet	,	 year 	 s 	 	of	 concent 	 ration 	 	 sole 	 ly 	 	on	work	and	individual	success	 me 	 ant 	 	that	in	his	 retire 	 ment 	 	he	could	find	no	 so 	 lace 	 	in	family	,	in	 re 	 creation 	 	,	in	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	or	in	 hob 	 bie 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	hole	in	his	heart	was	so	large	that	even	the	love	of	a	family	,	 with 	 out 	 	work	,	could	not	fill	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	his	 spirit 	 s 	 	sagged	,	his	body	 deterio 	 rated 	 	 un 	 til 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	he	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	about	his	own	death	.
in	 t 	 hose 	 	last	 year 	 s 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	was	so	 s 	 ad 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	american	people	look	 to 	 ward 	 	a	new	 p 	 resident 	 	and	 forget 	 ting 	 	him	.
he	spoke	with	immense	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	in	his	voice	,	 say 	 ing 	 	 may 	 be 	 	he	should	have	 s 	 pent 	 	more	time	with	his	children	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	children	in	turn	.
but	it	was	too	late	.
 de 	 spite 	 	all	that	power	,	all	that	wealth	,	he	was	 al 	 one 	 	when	he	 final 	 ly 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	--	his	ultimate	terror	 real 	 ized 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	for	that	third	sphere	of	play	,	which	he	never	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	enjoy	,	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	that	even	 th 	 is 	 	sphere	 requir 	 es 	 	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	of	time	and	energy	--	 en 	 ough 	 	so	that	a	hobby	,	a	 s 	 port 	 	,	a	love	of	music	,	or	art	,	or	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	or	any	form	of	 re 	 creation 	 	,	can	provide	true	pleasure	,	 relax 	 ation 	 	and	replenishment	.
so	deep	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	was	abraham	lincoln	's	love	of	shakespeare	,	that	he	made	time	to	 s 	 pend 	 	more	than	a	hundred	 night 	 s 	 	in	the	theater	,	even	 dur 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	dark	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	war	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	when	the	 light 	 s 	 	went	down	and	a	shakespeare	play	came	on	,	for	a	few	precious	 hour 	 s 	 	he	could	imagine	 him 	 self 	 	back	in	prince	hal	's	time	.
but	an	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	form	of	 relax 	 ation 	 	for	him	,	that	lyndon	johnson	never	could	enjoy	,	was	a	love	of	--	 some 	 how 	 	--	humor	,	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	out	what	hilarious	 part 	 s 	 	of	life	can	produce	 a 	 s 	 	a	sidelight	to	the	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	.
he	once	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	 laugh 	 ed 	 	so	he	did	not	cry	,	that	a	good	story	,	for	him	,	was	better	than	a	drop	of	 whisk 	 ey 	 	.
his	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 power 	 s 	 	had	first	 be 	 en 	 	 recogn 	 ized 	 	when	he	was	on	the	circuit	in	illinois	.
the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	and	the	 judg 	 es 	 	would	travel	from	one	 count 	 y 	 	 court 	 house 	 	to	the	other	,	and	when	 any 	 one 	 	was	 know 	 ing 	 	lincoln	was	in	town	,	they	would	come	from	 mile 	 s 	 	around	to	listen	to	him	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	.
he	would	stand	with	his	back	against	a	fire	and	entertain	the	crowd	for	 hour 	 s 	 	with	his	 wind 	 ing 	 	 tale 	 s 	 	.
and	all	these	 st 	 ories 	 	 be 	 came 	 	part	of	his	 memor 	 y 	 	bank	,	so	he	could	call	on	them	 when 	 ever 	 	he	 need 	 ed 	 	to	.
and	they	're	not	 quit 	 e 	 	what	you	might	expect	from	our	 mar 	 ble 	 	monument	.
one	of	his	 favor 	 ite 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	had	to	do	with	the	 revolution 	 ary 	 	war	hero	,	ethan	allen	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	lincoln	told	the	story	,	mr.	allen	went	to	britain	after	the	war	.
and	the	british	people	 we 	 re 	 	still	 up 	 set 	 	about	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	revolution	,	so	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	embarrass	him	a	little	bit	by	 put 	 ting 	 	a	huge	picture	of	general	washington	in	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 out 	 house 	 	,	where	he	'd	have	to	 en 	 counter 	 	it	.
they	 figur 	 ed 	 	he	'd	be	 up 	 set 	 	about	the	 in 	 dignity 	 	of	george	washington	 be 	 ing 	 	in	an	 out 	 house 	 	.
but	he	came	out	of	the	 out 	 house 	 	not	 up 	 set 	 	at	all	.
and	so	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	did	you	see	george	washington	in	there	?	``
``	oh	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 perfect 	 ly 	 	appropriate	place	for	him	.	``
``	what	do	you	mean	?	``	they	 s 	 aid 	 	.
``	well	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	make	an	englishman	shit	 fast 	 er 	 	than	the	sight	of	general	george	washington	.	``
so	you	can	imagine	,	if	you	are	in	the	middle	of	a	tense	cabinet	 meet 	 ing 	 	--	and	he	had	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	these	 st 	 ories 	 	--	you	would	have	to	relax	.
so	between	his	 night 	 ly 	 	 trek 	 s 	 	to	the	theater	,	his	story	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	and	his	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	sense	of	humor	and	his	love	of	 quo 	 ting 	 	shakespeare	and	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	he	found	that	form	of	play	which	carried	him	through	his	 day 	 s 	 	.
in	my	own	life	,	i	 s 	 hall 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	found	a	form	of	play	in	my	irrational	love	of	 base 	 ball 	 	.
which	 allow 	 s 	 	me	,	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	spring	training	to	the	end	of	the	fall	,	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	occupy	my	mind	and	heart	other	than	my	work	.
it	all	 beg 	 an 	 	when	i	was	 on 	 ly 	 	six	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	my	father	taught	me	that	 myster 	 ious 	 	art	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	score	while	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 base 	 ball 	 	 game 	 s 	 	--	so	that	when	he	went	to	work	in	new	york	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	i	could	record	for	him	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	that	afternoon	's	brooklyn	dodgers	game	.
now	,	when	you	're	 on 	 ly 	 	six	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	your	father	 come 	 s 	 	home	every	single	night	and	 listen 	 s 	 	to	you	--	 a 	 s 	 	i	now	 real 	 ize 	 	that	i	,	in	 excruciat 	 ing 	 	detail	,	recounted	every	single	play	of	every	inning	of	the	game	that	had	just	taken	place	that	afternoon	.
but	he	made	me	feel	i	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	him	a	fabulous	story	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	you	think	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	magic	about	 histo 	 ry 	 	to	keep	your	father	's	attention	.
in	fact	,	i	'm	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	narrative	art	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 night 	 ly 	 	 session 	 s 	 	with	my	father	.
 be 	 cause 	 	at	first	,	i	'd	be	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	i	would	 blur 	 t 	 	out	,	``	the	dodgers	won	!	``	or	,	``	the	dodgers	lost	!	``
which	took	much	of	the	drama	of	 th 	 is 	 	two	-	hour	 tell 	 ing 	 	away	.
so	i	 final 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	you	had	to	tell	a	story	from	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	middle	to	end	.
i	must	say	,	so	fervent	was	my	love	of	the	old	brooklyn	dodgers	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	that	i	had	to	confess	in	my	first	 confess 	 ion 	 	two	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	that	related	to	 base 	 ball 	 	.
the	first	 occur 	 red 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	dodgers	'	 catch 	 er 	 	,	roy	campanella	,	came	to	my	 home 	 town 	 	of	rockville	centre	,	long	 is 	 land 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	in	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	for	my	first	holy	 commun 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	was	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	--	first	person	i	'd	ever	see	 out 	 side 	 	of	ebbets	field	.
but	it	so	 happen 	 ed 	 	he	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	in	a	protestant	church	.
when	you	are	 br 	 ought 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	catholic	,	you	think	that	if	you	ever	set	foot	in	a	protestant	church	,	you	'll	be	 s 	 truck 	 	dead	at	the	threshold	.
so	i	went	to	my	father	in	 tear 	 s 	 	,	``	what	are	we	going	to	do	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	worry	.	he	's	 s 	 peaking 	 	in	a	 par 	 ish 	 	hall	.
we	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 fold 	 ing 	 	 chair 	 s 	 	.	he	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	sportsmanship	.
it	's	not	a	 s 	 in 	 	.	``
but	 a 	 s 	 	i	left	that	night	,	i	was	certain	that	 some 	 how 	 	i	'd	 trade 	 d 	 	the	life	of	my	everlasting	soul	for	 th 	 is 	 	one	night	with	roy	campanella	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 indulge 	 nce 	 s 	 	around	that	i	could	buy	.
so	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 in 	 	on	my	soul	when	i	went	to	my	first	 confess 	 ion 	 	.
i	told	the	priest	right	away	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	problem	.	it	was	n't	a	religious	service	.	``
but	then	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	what	else	,	my	child	?	``
and	then	came	my	second	 s 	 in 	 	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	sandwich	it	in	between	 talk 	 ing 	 	too	much	in	church	,	 wish 	 ing 	 	harm	to	 other 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	mean	to	my	 sister 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	to	whom	did	you	wish	harm	?	``
and	i	had	to	say	that	i	 wish 	 ed 	 	that	 vari 	 ous 	 	new	york	yankees	 player 	 s 	 	would	break	 arm 	 s 	 	,	 leg 	 s 	 	and	 ankle 	 s 	 	--	--	so	that	the	brooklyn	dodgers	could	win	 the 	 ir 	 	first	world	 s 	 eries 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	often	do	you	make	these	 horr 	 ible 	 	 wish 	 es 	 	?	``
and	i	had	to	say	,	every	night	when	i	 s 	 aid 	 	my	 pray 	 ers 	 	.
so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	i	'll	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.
i	love	the	brooklyn	dodgers	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	,	but	i	promise	you	some	day	they	will	win	 fair 	 ly 	 	and	 square 	 ly 	 	.
you	do	not	need	to	wish	harm	on	 other 	 s 	 	to	make	it	happen	.	``
``	oh	 y 	 es 	 	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	.
but	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	my	first	 confess 	 ion 	 	--	to	a	 base 	 ball 	 	-	loving	priest	!
well	,	 th 	 ough 	 	my	father	 di 	 ed 	 	of	a	sudden	heart	attack	when	i	was	still	in	my	20s	,	before	i	had	gotten	married	and	had	my	three	 son 	 s 	 	,	i	have	 pass 	 ed 	 	his	 memor 	 y 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	his	love	of	 base 	 ball 	 	--	on	to	my	 boy 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 ough 	 	when	the	dodgers	 abandon 	 ed 	 	us	to	come	to	l.a.	,	i	lost	faith	in	 base 	 ball 	 	 un 	 til 	 	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	boston	and	 be 	 came 	 	an	irrational	red	 sock 	 s 	 	fan	.
and	i	must	say	,	even	now	,	when	i	 s 	 it 	 	with	my	 son 	 s 	 	with	our	season	 ticket 	 s 	 	,	i	can	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	close	my	 eye 	 s 	 	against	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	imagine	 my 	 self 	 	,	a	young	girl	once	more	,	in	the	presence	of	my	father	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	 player 	 s 	 	of	my	youth	on	the	grassy	 field 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	:	jackie	robinson	,	roy	campanella	,	 pe 	 e 	 	wee	reese	,	and	 du 	 ke 	 	snider	.
i	must	say	there	is	magic	in	these	 moment 	 s 	 	.
when	i	open	my	 eye 	 s 	 	and	i	see	my	 son 	 s 	 	in	the	place	where	my	father	once	 s 	 at 	 	,	i	feel	an	 in 	 visible 	 	 loyal 	 ty 	 	and	love	 link 	 ing 	 	my	 son 	 s 	 	to	the	 grand 	 father 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	face	they	never	had	a	chance	to	see	,	but	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	heart	and	soul	they	have	come	to	know	through	all	the	 st 	 ories 	 	i	have	told	.
which	is	why	,	in	the	end	,	i	 s 	 hall 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	love	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	me	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	 life 	 time 	 	looking	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	past	.
