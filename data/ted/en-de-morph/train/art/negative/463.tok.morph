there	's	a	great	big	elephant	in	the	room	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
so	let	's	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	that	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	you	a	current	picture	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
that	's	what	i	have	 be 	 hind 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
but	of	course	what	we	have	to	remember	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	what	you	have	to	think	about	is	,	when	you	're	 danc 	 ing 	 	in	the	 flame 	 s 	 	,	what	's	next	?
so	what	i	'm	going	to	try	to	do	in	the	next	17	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	is	i	'm	going	to	talk	first	about	the	 flame 	 s 	 	--	where	we	are	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	--	and	then	i	'm	going	to	take	three	 trend 	 s 	 	that	have	taken	place	at	ted	over	the	last	25	 year 	 s 	 	and	that	will	take	place	in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	and	i	will	try	and	 br 	 ing 	 	them	together	.
and	i	will	try	and	give	you	a	sense	of	what	the	ultimate	 re 	 boot 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 t 	 hose 	 	three	 trend 	 s 	 	are	the	ability	to	engineer	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	ability	to	engineer	 tissue 	 s 	 	,	and	 robot 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 how 	 	it	will	all	make	sense	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	let	's	start	with	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
there	's	a	couple	of	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	still	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	.
one	is	leverage	.
and	the	problem	with	leverage	is	it	 make 	 s 	 	the	u.s.	financial	system	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	a	normal	commercial	bank	 ha 	 s 	 	nine	to	10	 time 	 s 	 	leverage	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	for	every	dollar	you	deposit	,	it	 loan 	 s 	 	out	about	nine	or	10	.
a	normal	 invest 	 ment 	 	bank	is	not	a	deposit	bank	,	it	's	an	 invest 	 ment 	 	bank	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	15	to	20	 time 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	b	of	a	in	september	had	32	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	your	friendly	citibank	had	47	 time 	 s 	 	.
 oop 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	every	bad	loan	 go 	 es 	 	bad	47	 time 	 s 	 	over	.
and	that	,	of	course	,	is	the	reason	why	all	of	you	are	making	 s 	 uch 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	and	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 don 	 ations 	 	to	these	nice	 folk 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	about	that	,	you	've	got	to	wonder	:	so	what	do	 bank 	 s 	 	have	in	store	for	you	now	?
it	ai	n't	 pre 	 tty 	 	.
the	government	,	 mean 	 while 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	like	santa	claus	.
we	all	love	santa	claus	,	right	?
but	the	problem	with	santa	 clau 	 s 	 e 	 	is	,	if	you	look	at	the	 man 	 d 	 atory 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	of	what	these	 folk 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	and	promising	 folk 	 s 	 	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	in	1967	,	38	percent	was	 man 	 d 	 atory 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	on	what	we	call	``	 entitlement 	 s 	 	.	``
and	then	by	2007	it	was	68	percent	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	run	 in 	 to 	 	100	percent	 un 	 til 	 	about	2030	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	so	 bus 	 y 	 	giving	away	a	trillion	here	,	a	trillion	there	,	that	we	've	 br 	 ought 	 	that	date	of	 reckon 	 ing 	 	forward	to	about	2017	.
and	we	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	able	to	lay	these	 debt 	 s 	 	off	on	our	 kid 	 s 	 	,	but	,	guess	what	?
we	're	going	to	start	to	pay	them	.
and	the	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	,	now	that	the	bill	's	come	due	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	santa	is	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	cute	when	it	's	 summer 	 time 	 	.
right	?
here	's	some	 ad 	 vice 	 	from	one	of	the	largest	 invest 	 ors 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	 run 	 s 	 	the	 chin 	 a 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	corporation	.
he	is	the	main	 buy 	 er 	 	of	u.s.	 treasu 	 ry 	 	 bond 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 g 	 ave 	 	an	interview	in	december	.
here	's	his	first	bit	of	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
and	here	's	his	second	bit	of	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
and	,	by	the	way	,	the	chinese	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	 reiterate 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	at	davos	last	sunday	.
 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	 get 	 ting 	 	serious	 en 	 ough 	 	that	if	we	do	n't	start	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	the	 defici 	 t 	 	,	we	're	going	to	end	up	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	dollar	.
and	then	all	 bet 	 s 	 	are	off	.
let	me	show	you	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
i	think	i	can	 safe 	 ly 	 	say	that	i	'm	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 trillion 	 aire 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	actual	bill	.
and	it	's	10	 tri 	 li 	 ion 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	bill	is	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	worth	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
that	was	eight	 buck 	 s 	 	last	week	,	four	 buck 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	week	,	a	buck	next	week	.
and	that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 curr 	 encies 	 	when	you	do	n't	stand	 be 	 hind 	 	them	.
so	the	next	time	 some 	 body 	 	 a 	 s 	 	cute	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	up	on	your	 door 	 step 	 	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	creature	's	 call 	 ed 	 	chrysler	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	ford	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	...	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	--	you	've	just	got	to	say	no	.
and	you	've	got	to	start	 banish 	 ing 	 	a	word	that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	entitlement	.	``
and	the	reason	we	have	to	do	that	in	the	short	term	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	just	run	out	of	cash	.
if	you	look	at	the	federal	budget	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
the	 o 	 range 	 	slice	is	what	's	 dis 	 cre 	 tion 	 ary 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	else	is	 man 	 d 	 ated 	 	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	if	we	cut	out	the	 bridge 	 s 	 	to	alaska	in	the	 over 	 all 	 	scheme	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	have	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 cap 	 ping 	 	our	medical	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	a	 mon 	 ster 	 	that	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	going	to	eat	the	entire	budget	.
we	've	got	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	to	retire	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	.
if	you	're	60	to	65	you	retire	on	time	.
your	401	just	got	 nail 	 ed 	 	.
if	you	're	50	to	60	we	want	you	to	work	two	 year 	 s 	 	more	.
if	you	're	under	50	we	want	you	to	work	four	more	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	why	that	's	 reason 	 able 	 	is	,	when	your	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	social	security	,	they	got	it	at	65	and	 we 	 re 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	check	out	at	68	.
sixty	-	eight	is	young	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	got	to	cut	the	 militar 	 y 	 	about	three	percent	a	year	.
we	've	got	to	limit	other	 man 	 d 	 atory 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	.
we	've	got	to	quit	 borrow 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	the	interest	is	going	to	eat	that	whole	pie	.
and	we	've	got	to	end	up	with	a	 small 	 er 	 	government	.
and	if	we	do	n't	start	changing	 th 	 is 	 	trend	line	,	we	are	going	to	lose	the	dollar	and	start	to	look	like	iceland	.
i	got	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	happen	when	hell	 freeze 	 s 	 	over	.
but	let	me	 re 	 mind 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	december	it	did	snow	in	vegas	.
here	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	do	n't	address	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
so	,	japan	had	a	 fisc 	 al 	 	real	 e 	 state 	 	crisis	back	in	the	late	'80s	.
and	 it 	 s 	 	225	largest	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	worth	one	quarter	of	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	18	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	do	n't	fix	 th 	 is 	 	now	,	how	would	you	like	to	see	a	dow	3,500	in	2026	?
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	not	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
and	 un 	 less 	 	you	want	 th 	 is 	 	person	to	not	just	 be 	 come 	 	the	cfo	of	florida	,	but	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	we	'd	better	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
that	's	the	short	term	.	that	's	the	flame	part	.
that	's	the	financial	crisis	.
now	,	right	 be 	 hind 	 	the	financial	crisis	there	's	a	second	and	 big 	 ger 	 	wave	that	we	need	to	talk	about	.
that	wave	is	much	 large 	 r 	 	,	much	more	 power 	 ful 	 	,	and	that	's	of	course	the	wave	of	technology	.
and	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	cut	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	grow	.
among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 start 	 up 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	.02	percent	of	u.s.	gdp	 invest 	 ment 	 m 	 	and	they	're	about	17.8	percent	of	 out 	 put 	 	.
it	's	 group 	 s 	 	like	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	that	generate	the	future	of	the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	've	got	to	keep	growing	.
we	do	n't	have	to	keep	growing	these	 bridge 	 s 	 	to	 no 	 where 	 	.
so	let	's	 br 	 ing 	 	a	 rom 	 ance 	 	 novel 	 ist 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	.
and	that	's	where	these	three	 trend 	 s 	 	come	together	.
that	's	where	the	ability	to	engineer	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	,	the	ability	to	engineer	 tissue 	 s 	 	,	and	the	ability	to	engineer	 robot 	 s 	 	begin	to	lead	to	a	 re 	 boot 	 	.
and	let	me	 re 	 cap 	 	some	of	the	stuff	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	.
craig	venter	 show 	 ed 	 	up	last	year	and	 show 	 ed 	 	you	the	first	fully	 programm 	 able 	 	cell	that	 act 	 s 	 	like	 hard 	 ware 	 	where	you	can	insert	dna	and	have	it	boot	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	different	species	.
in	parallel	,	the	 folk 	 s 	 	at	mit	have	 be 	 en 	 	building	a	standard	 registr 	 y 	 	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
so	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	radio	 s 	 hack 	 	for	biology	.
you	can	go	out	and	get	your	 protein 	 s 	 	,	your	rna	,	your	dna	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	start	building	stuff	.
in	2006	they	 br 	 ought 	 	together	high	school	 student 	 s 	 	and	college	 student 	 s 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	to	build	these	little	odd	 creature 	 s 	 	.
they	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	circuit	 board 	 s 	 	.
here	was	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	they	built	.
so	,	 cell 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	cycle	.
first	they	do	n't	grow	.
then	they	grow	 exponential 	 ly 	 	.
then	they	stop	growing	.
graduate	 student 	 s 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	a	way	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	which	stage	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	.
so	they	engineered	these	 cell 	 s 	 	so	that	when	they	're	growing	in	the	exponential	phase	,	they	would	smell	like	 winter 	 green 	 	.
and	when	they	 stop 	 ped 	 	growing	they	would	smell	like	 banana 	 s 	 	.
and	you	could	tell	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	when	your	experiment	was	 work 	 ing 	 	and	was	n't	,	and	where	it	was	in	the	phase	.
 th 	 is 	 	got	a	bit	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
twenty	-	one	 count 	 ries 	 	came	together	.	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 team 	 s 	 	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	.
the	team	from	rice	university	 start 	 ed 	 	to	engineer	the	 sub 	 stance 	 	in	red	wine	that	 make 	 s 	 	red	wine	good	for	you	 in 	 to 	 	beer	.
so	you	take	resveratrol	and	you	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	beer	.
of	course	,	one	of	the	 judg 	 es 	 	is	 wander 	 ing 	 	by	,	and	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	!	cancer	-	 fight 	 ing 	 	beer	!	there	is	a	god	.	``
the	team	from	taiwan	was	a	little	bit	more	 ambit 	 ious 	 	.
they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	engineer	 bacteria 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	they	would	act	 a 	 s 	 	your	 kid 	 ney 	 s 	 	.
four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
and	people	 ooh 	 ed 	 	and	 ahh 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	cliff	tabin	had	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	grow	an	extra	wing	on	a	chicken	.
and	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	stuff	back	then	.
but	now	moving	from	bacterial	 engineer 	 ing 	 	to	tissue	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	let	me	show	you	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	that	period	of	time	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	you	saw	 th 	 is 	 	creature	.
an	 al 	 most 	 	-	extinct	animal	from	xochimilco	,	mexico	 call 	 ed 	 	an	axolotl	that	can	re	-	generate	 it 	 s 	 	 limb 	 s 	 	.
you	can	freeze	half	 it 	 s 	 	heart	.	it	 re 	 grow 	 s 	 	.
you	can	freeze	half	the	brain	.	it	 re 	 grow 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	 leav 	 ing 	 	congress	.
but	now	,	you	do	n't	have	to	have	the	animal	 it 	 self 	 	to	 re 	 generate 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	build	 clon 	 ed 	 	 mic 	 e 	 	 mola 	 rs 	 	in	 pe 	 tri 	 	 dish 	 es 	 	.
and	,	of	course	if	you	can	build	 mic 	 e 	 	 mola 	 rs 	 	in	 pe 	 tri 	 	 dish 	 es 	 	,	you	can	grow	human	 mola 	 rs 	 	in	 pe 	 tri 	 	 dish 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	should	not	surprise	you	,	right	?
i	mean	,	you	're	born	with	no	 tee 	 th 	 	.
you	give	away	all	your	 tee 	 th 	 	to	the	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	.
you	re	-	grow	a	set	of	 tee 	 th 	 	.
but	then	if	you	lose	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	second	set	of	 tee 	 th 	 	,	they	do	n't	 re 	 grow 	 	,	 un 	 less 	 	,	if	you	're	a	lawyer	.
but	,	of	course	,	for	most	of	us	,	we	know	how	to	grow	 tee 	 th 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	can	take	adult	stem	 tee 	 th 	 	,	put	them	on	a	 bio 	 degradable 	 	mold	,	re	-	grow	a	tooth	,	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	implant	it	.
and	we	can	do	it	with	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	,	a	spanish	woman	who	was	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	t.b	.	had	a	donor	 trac 	 hea 	 	,	they	took	all	the	 cell 	 s 	 	off	the	 trac 	 hea 	 	,	they	 spray 	 paint 	 ed 	 	her	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	onto	that	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	.
she	 re 	 grew 	 	her	own	 trac 	 hea 	 	,	and	72	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	it	was	 implant 	 ed 	 	.
she	's	now	running	around	with	her	 kid 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	on	in	tony	atala	's	lab	in	wake	forest	where	he	is	re	-	growing	 ear 	 s 	 	for	 inju 	 red 	 	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	 al 	 so 	 	re	-	growing	 bladder 	 s 	 	.
so	there	are	now	nine	women	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	boston	with	re	-	grown	 bladder 	 s 	 	,	which	is	much	more	 pleas 	 ant 	 	than	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	with	a	whole	bunch	of	plastic	 bag 	 s 	 	for	the	rest	of	your	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	right	?
i	mean	,	you	understand	where	 th 	 is 	 	story	's	going	.
but	,	i	mean	it	 get 	 s 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
last	year	,	 th 	 is 	 	group	was	able	to	take	all	the	 cell 	 s 	 	off	a	heart	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	just	the	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	.
then	,	they	 spray 	 ed 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	onto	that	heart	,	from	a	mouse	.
 t 	 hose 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	self	-	 organize 	 d 	 	,	and	that	heart	 start 	 ed 	 	to	beat	.
life	 happen 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	be	one	of	the	ultimate	 paper 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	japan	and	in	the	u.s.	,	 publish 	 ed 	 	at	the	same	time	,	and	it	 re 	 boot 	 ed 	 	skin	 cell 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	last	year	.
that	 me 	 ant 	 	that	you	can	take	the	stuff	right	here	,	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	in	your	body	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 coming 	 	common	,	it	's	moving	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	moving	in	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	.
third	trend	:	 robot 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	of	a	certain	age	grew	up	 expect 	 ing 	 	that	by	now	we	would	have	rosie	the	robot	from	``	the	jetsons	``	in	our	house	.
and	all	we	've	got	is	a	roomba	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	thought	we	'd	have	 th 	 is 	 	robot	to	 war 	 n 	 	us	of	danger	.
did	n't	happen	.
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	engineered	for	a	flat	world	,	right	?
so	,	rosie	 run 	 s 	 	around	on	 s 	 k 	 ates 	 	and	the	other	one	ran	on	flat	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	.
if	you	do	n't	have	a	flat	world	,	that	's	not	good	,	which	is	why	the	robot	's	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	a	little	different	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	boston	 dynamic 	 s 	 	'	``	bigdog	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	get	to	a	physical	turing	test	.
o.k	.	,	so	let	me	 re 	 mind 	 	you	,	a	turing	test	is	where	you	've	got	a	wall	,	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	on	the	other	side	of	the	wall	,	and	when	you	do	n't	know	if	that	thing	is	human	or	animal	--	that	's	when	 computer 	 s 	 	have	 reach 	 ed 	 	human	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	 intellig 	 ence 	 	turing	rest	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	get	to	a	physical	turing	test	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	moving	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	by	the	way	,	that	thing	can	carry	about	350	 pound 	 s 	 	of	weight	.
these	are	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	.
you	've	 al 	 so 	 	got	flies	,	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	flies	,	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	made	by	robert	wood	at	harvard	.
you	've	got	stickybots	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	made	at	stanford	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	 br 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	together	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	 br 	 ing 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 bio 	 logical 	 	tissue	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	 mechanic 	 s 	 	together	,	you	begin	to	get	some	 re 	 ally 	 	odd	 question 	 s 	 	.
in	the	last	olympics	,	 th 	 is 	 	 gentle 	 man 	 	,	who	had	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	world	 record 	 s 	 	in	the	special	olympics	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	run	in	the	normal	olympics	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	issue	with	oscar	pistorius	is	he	was	born	 with 	 out 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	in	the	lower	part	of	his	 leg 	 s 	 	.
he	came	 with 	 in 	 	about	a	second	of	 qual 	 ifying 	 	.
he	 su 	 ed 	 	to	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	run	,	and	he	won	the	suit	,	but	did	n't	 qual 	 ify 	 	by	time	.
next	olympics	,	you	can	bet	that	oscar	,	or	one	of	oscar	's	 success 	 ors 	 	,	is	going	to	make	the	time	.
and	two	or	three	olympics	after	that	,	they	are	going	to	be	 un 	 beat 	 able 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	 br 	 ing 	 	these	 trend 	 s 	 	together	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	of	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	take	people	who	are	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	deaf	,	who	can	now	begin	to	hear	--	i	mean	,	remember	the	evolution	of	 hear 	 ing 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	,	right	?
i	mean	,	your	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	had	these	great	big	 con 	 es 	 	,	and	then	your	 parent 	 s 	 	had	these	odd	boxes	that	would	squawk	at	odd	 time 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	,	and	now	we	have	these	little	 bud 	 s 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	 s 	 ees 	 	.
and	now	you	have	 cochlea 	 r 	 	 implant 	 s 	 	that	go	 in 	 to 	 	people	's	 head 	 s 	 	and	allow	the	deaf	to	begin	to	hear	.
now	,	they	ca	n't	hear	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	you	and	i	can	.
but	,	in	10	or	15	machine	 generation 	 s 	 	they	will	,	and	these	are	machine	 generation 	 s 	 	,	not	human	 generation 	 s 	 	.
and	about	two	or	three	 year 	 s 	 	after	they	can	hear	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	you	and	i	can	,	they	'll	be	able	to	hear	 may 	 be 	 	how	 bat 	 s 	 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	or	how	 whale 	 s 	 	talk	,	or	how	 dog 	 s 	 	talk	,	and	other	 type 	 s 	 	of	 ton 	 al 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	.
they	'll	be	able	to	focus	 the 	 ir 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	they	'll	be	able	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	,	 de 	 crease 	 	the	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	,	do	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	ca	n't	do	.
and	the	same	thing	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 eye 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	group	in	germany	that	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	engineer	 eye 	 s 	 	so	that	people	who	are	blind	can	begin	to	see	light	and	dark	.
 ver 	 y 	 	primitive	.
and	then	they	'll	be	able	to	see	shape	.
and	then	they	'll	be	able	to	see	color	,	and	then	they	'll	be	able	to	see	in	definition	,	and	one	day	,	they	'll	see	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	you	and	i	can	.
and	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	after	that	,	they	'll	be	able	to	see	in	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	,	they	'll	be	able	to	see	in	 infra 	 red 	 	,	they	'll	be	able	to	focus	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	be	able	to	come	 in 	 to 	 	a	 micro 	 focus 	 	.
they	'll	do	stuff	you	and	i	ca	n't	do	.
all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	coming	together	,	and	it	's	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	understand	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	worry	about	the	 flame 	 s 	 	of	the	present	,	to	keep	an	eye	on	the	future	.
and	,	of	course	,	the	future	is	looking	back	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	next	week	is	the	200th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	darwin	's	birth	.
and	it	's	the	150th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	the	 public 	 ation 	 	of	``	the	origin	of	species	.	``
and	darwin	,	of	course	,	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	evolution	is	a	natural	state	.
it	is	a	natural	state	in	 every 	 thing 	 	that	is	 al 	 ive 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 hominid 	 s 	 	.
there	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	22	species	of	 hominid 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	around	,	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	have	 wander 	 ed 	 	in	different	 place 	 s 	 	,	have	gone	extinct	.
it	is	common	for	 hominid 	 s 	 	to	evolve	.
and	that	's	the	reason	why	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	look	at	the	hominid	fossil	record	,	 erect 	 us 	 	,	and	heidelbergensis	,	and	 flor 	 esiensis 	 	,	and	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	,	and	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	,	all	 over 	 lap 	 	.
the	common	state	of	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	is	to	have	 over 	 lap 	 ping 	 	 version 	 s 	 	of	 hominid 	 s 	 	,	not	one	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	of	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	that	,	here	's	a	brief	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	 create 	 d 	 	13.7	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	then	you	 create 	 d 	 	all	the	 star 	 s 	 	,	and	all	the	 planet 	 s 	 	,	and	all	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	and	all	the	 milk 	 y 	 	ways	.
and	then	you	 create 	 d 	 	earth	about	4.5	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	then	you	got	life	about	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	then	you	got	 hominid 	 s 	 	about	0.006	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	then	you	got	our	version	of	 hominid 	 s 	 	about	0.0015	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
ta	-	dah	!
 may 	 be 	 	the	reason	for	thr	creation	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	all	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	and	all	the	 planet 	 s 	 	,	and	all	the	energy	,	and	all	the	dark	energy	,	and	all	the	rest	of	stuff	is	to	create	what	's	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
 may 	 be 	 	not	.
that	would	be	a	 mild 	 ly 	 	 arrog 	 ant 	 	 view 	 point 	 	.
so	,	if	that	's	not	the	purpose	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	then	what	's	next	?
i	think	what	we	're	going	to	see	is	we	're	going	to	see	a	different	species	of	hominid	.
i	think	we	're	going	to	move	from	a	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	homo	evolutis	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	1,000	 year 	 s 	 	out	.
i	think	most	of	us	are	going	to	glance	at	it	,	and	our	 grand 	 children 	 	are	going	to	begin	to	live	it	.
and	a	homo	evolutis	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	together	these	three	 trend 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	hominid	that	 take 	 s 	 	direct	and	 de 	 liberate 	 	control	over	the	evolution	of	his	species	,	her	species	and	other	species	.
and	that	,	of	course	,	would	be	the	ultimate	 re 	 boot 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
