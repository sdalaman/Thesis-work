so	let	me	just	start	with	my	story	.
so	i	 to 	 re 	 	my	knee	joint	 men 	 is 	 cus 	 	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	soccer	in	college	.
then	i	went	on	to	tear	my	acl	,	the	 lig 	 a 	 ment 	 	in	my	knee	,	and	then	 develop 	 ed 	 	an	 arthri 	 tic 	 	knee	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	have	that	same	story	,	and	,	by	the	way	,	i	married	a	woman	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	story	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 motiv 	 ated 	 	me	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	 ortho 	 pedic 	 	surgeon	and	to	see	if	i	could	n't	focus	on	 solution 	 s 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	would	keep	me	 play 	 ing 	 	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	and	not	limit	me	.
so	with	that	,	let	me	just	show	you	a	quick	video	to	get	you	in	the	mood	of	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explain	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	we	are	all	aware	of	the	risk	of	cancer	,	but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	disease	that	's	destined	to	affect	even	more	of	us	:	 art 	 hritis 	 	.
cancer	may	kill	you	,	but	when	you	look	at	the	 number 	 s 	 	,	 art 	 hritis 	 	 ruin 	 s 	 	more	 live 	 s 	 	.
 assum 	 ing 	 	you	live	a	long	life	,	there	's	a	50	percent	chance	you	'll	develop	 art 	 hritis 	 	.
and	it	's	not	just	aging	that	 cause 	 s 	 	 art 	 hritis 	 	.
common	 inju 	 ries 	 	can	lead	to	 decade 	 s 	 	of	pain	,	 un 	 til 	 	our	 joint 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	grind	to	a	halt	.
desperate	for	a	solution	,	we	've	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	 engineer 	 ing 	 	to	design	artificial	 component 	 s 	 	to	replace	our	worn	-	out	body	 part 	 s 	 	,	but	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	the	modern	buzz	around	the	 promise 	 s 	 	of	a	 bio 	 nic 	 	body	,	should	n't	we	stop	and	ask	if	there	's	a	better	,	more	natural	way	?
let	's	consider	an	 alter 	 native 	 	path	.
what	if	all	the	 replace 	 ments 	 	our	bodies	need	 al 	 ready 	 	exist	in	nature	,	or	 with 	 in 	 	our	own	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	field	of	 bio 	 logic 	 	 replace 	 ments 	 	,	where	we	replace	worn	-	out	 part 	 s 	 	with	new	,	natural	 one 	 s 	 	.
kevin	stone	:	and	so	,	the	mission	is	:	how	do	i	treat	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 bio 	 logically 	 	?
and	let	's	talk	about	both	what	i	did	for	my	wife	,	and	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	other	 patient 	 s 	 	.
first	thing	for	my	wife	,	and	the	most	common	thing	i	hear	from	my	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	the	40-	to	80	-	year	-	old	age	group	,	70	-	year	-	old	age	group	,	is	they	come	in	and	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	doc	,	is	n't	there	just	a	shock	 absorb 	 er 	 	you	can	put	in	my	knee	?
i	'm	not	ready	for	joint	 re 	 placement 	 	.	``
and	so	for	her	,	i	put	in	a	human	 men 	 is 	 cus 	 	 allo 	 graft 	 	donor	right	 in 	 to 	 	that	[	knee	]	joint	space	.
and	[	the	 allo 	 graft 	 	]	 replace 	 s 	 	[	the	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 men 	 is 	 cus 	 	]	.
and	then	for	that	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	 lig 	 a 	 ment 	 	,	we	put	in	a	human	donor	 lig 	 a 	 ment 	 	to	 stabil 	 ize 	 	the	knee	.
and	then	for	the	 damage 	 d 	 	 art 	 hritis 	 	on	the	surface	,	we	did	a	stem	cell	paste	graft	,	which	we	designed	in	1991	,	to	 re 	 grow 	 	that	 art 	 icular 	 	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	surface	and	give	it	back	a	smooth	surface	there	.
so	here	's	my	wife	's	bad	knee	on	the	left	,	and	her	just	 hik 	 ing 	 	now	four	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	aspen	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	well	.
and	it	 work 	 s 	 	,	not	just	for	my	wife	,	but	 certain 	 ly 	 	for	other	 patient 	 s 	 	.
the	girl	on	the	video	,	jen	hudak	,	just	won	the	superpipe	in	aspen	just	nine	 month 	 s 	 	after	 hav 	 ing 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	her	knee	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	in	the	other	image	--	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	paste	graft	to	that	knee	.
and	so	we	can	 re 	 grow 	 	these	 surface 	 s 	 	 bio 	 logically 	 	.
so	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	success	,	why	is	n't	that	good	 en 	 ough 	 	,	you	might	ask	.
well	the	reason	is	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	donor	 cycle 	 s 	 	.
there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	young	,	 health 	 y 	 	people	 fall 	 ing 	 	off	 the 	 ir 	 	 motor 	 cycle 	 	and	 don 	 ating 	 	that	tissue	to	us	.
and	the	tissue	's	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	.
and	so	that	's	not	going	to	be	a	solution	that	's	going	to	get	us	global	with	 bio 	 logic 	 	tissue	.
but	the	solution	is	animal	tissue	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	,	it	's	cheap	,	you	can	get	it	from	young	,	 health 	 y 	 	 tissue 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 bar 	 rier 	 	is	 immuno 	 logy 	 	.
and	the	specific	 bar 	 rier 	 	is	a	specific	epitope	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 gal 	 actosyl 	 	,	or	gal	epitope	.
so	if	we	're	going	to	transplant	animal	 tissue 	 s 	 	to	people	,	we	have	to	figure	out	a	way	to	get	rid	of	that	epitope	.
so	my	story	in	 work 	 ing 	 	with	animal	 tissue 	 s 	 	 start 	 s 	 	in	1984	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	first	with	cow	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	 tend 	 on 	 	,	where	we	would	take	the	cow	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	 tend 	 on 	 	,	which	is	type	-	i	 collage 	 n 	 	,	strip	it	of	 it 	 s 	 	 anti 	 gen 	 s 	 	by	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	it	with	an	acid	and	detergent	wash	and	 form 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 re 	 generation 	 	template	.
we	would	then	take	that	 re 	 generation 	 	template	and	insert	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 men 	 is 	 cus 	 	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	to	 re 	 grow 	 	that	in	a	patient	's	knee	.
we	've	now	 d 	 one 	 	that	procedure	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	in	over	4,000	 case 	 s 	 	,	so	it	's	an	fda	-	approved	and	 world 	 wide 	 	-	 accept 	 ed 	 	way	to	 re 	 grow 	 	the	 men 	 is 	 cus 	 	.
and	that	's	great	when	i	can	 de 	 grade 	 	the	tissue	.
but	what	 happen 	 s 	 	for	your	 lig 	 a 	 ment 	 	when	i	need	an	 in 	 tact 	 	 lig 	 a 	 ment 	 	?
i	ca	n't	grind	it	up	in	a	 blend 	 er 	 	.
so	in	that	case	,	i	have	to	design	--	and	we	designed	with	uri	galili	and	tom	turek	--	an	enzyme	wash	to	wash	away	,	or	strip	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 gal 	 actosyl 	 	 epitope 	 s 	 	with	a	specific	enzyme	.
and	we	call	that	a	``	gal	 strip 	 ping 	 	``	 techni 	 que 	 	.
what	we	do	is	 human 	 ize 	 	the	tissue	.
it	's	by	gal	 strip 	 ping 	 	that	tissue	we	 human 	 ize 	 	it	,	and	then	we	can	put	it	back	 in 	 to 	 	a	patient	's	knee	.
and	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	.	now	we	've	taken	pig	 lig 	 a 	 ment 	 	--	young	,	 health 	 y 	 	,	big	tissue	,	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	10	 patient 	 s 	 	in	an	fda	-	approved	trial	--	and	then	one	of	our	 patient 	 s 	 	went	on	to	have	three	canadian	 master 	 s 	 	 down 	 hill 	 	 champion 	 ship 	 s 	 	--	on	his	``	pig	-	lig	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	he	 call 	 s 	 	it	.	so	we	know	it	can	work	.
and	there	's	a	wide	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	of	 th 	 is 	 	tissue	now	 pend 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	about	the	next	step	?
what	about	 get 	 ting 	 	to	a	total	 bio 	 logic 	 	knee	 re 	 placement 	 	,	not	just	the	 part 	 s 	 	?
how	are	we	going	to	 revolution 	 ize 	 	artificial	joint	 re 	 placement 	 	?
well	here	's	how	we	're	going	to	do	it	.
so	what	we	're	going	to	do	is	take	an	 art 	 icular 	 	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	from	a	young	,	 health 	 y 	 	pig	,	strip	it	of	 it 	 s 	 	 anti 	 gen 	 s 	 	,	load	it	with	your	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	then	put	it	back	on	to	that	 arthri 	 tic 	 	surface	in	your	knee	,	tack	it	on	there	,	have	you	heal	that	surface	and	then	create	a	new	 bio 	 logic 	 	surface	for	your	knee	.
so	that	's	our	 bio 	 logic 	 	approach	right	now	.
we	're	going	to	 re 	 build 	 	your	knee	with	the	 part 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	 re 	 surface 	 	it	with	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	surface	.
but	we	have	other	 advantage 	 s 	 	from	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	.
there	's	a	benefit	of	400	million	 year 	 s 	 	of	 ambul 	 ation 	 	.
we	can	harness	 t 	 hose 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
we	can	use	 thick 	 er 	 	,	 young 	 er 	 	,	better	 tissue 	 s 	 	than	you	might	have	 inju 	 red 	 	in	your	knee	,	or	that	you	might	have	when	you	're	40	,	50	or	60	.
we	can	do	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 out 	 patient 	 	procedure	.
we	can	strip	that	tissue	 ver 	 y 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	,	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	can	get	 bio 	 logic 	 	knee	 re 	 placement 	 	to	go	global	.
and	so	welcome	to	super	 bio 	 logic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 hard 	 ware 	 	.
it	's	not	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
it	's	 bio 	 ware 	 	.
it	's	version	2.0	of	you	.
and	so	with	that	,	coming	to	a	--	coming	to	an	 oper 	 ating 	 	theater	near	you	soon	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
