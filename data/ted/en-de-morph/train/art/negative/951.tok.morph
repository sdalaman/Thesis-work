my	story	is	a	little	bit	about	war	.
it	's	about	 dis 	 illusion 	 ment 	 	.
it	's	about	death	.
and	it	's	about	 re 	 discover 	 ing 	 	 ideal 	 ism 	 	in	all	of	that	 wreck 	 age 	 	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	there	's	a	 less 	 on 	 	about	how	to	deal	with	our	 screw 	 ed 	 	-	up	,	 fragment 	 ing 	 	and	 danger 	 ous 	 	world	of	the	21st	century	.
i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 straight 	 forward 	 	 narrative 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	life	or	 histo 	 ry 	 	written	 a 	 s 	 	decision	``	a	``	led	to	 con 	 sequence 	 	``	b	``	led	to	 con 	 sequence 	 	``	c	``	--	these	neat	 narrative 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 present 	 ed 	 	with	,	and	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	 encourag 	 e 	 	in	each	other	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 random 	 ness 	 	,	and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	me	 be 	 coming 	 	a	diplomat	was	random	.
i	'm	 color 	 blind 	 	.
i	was	born	 un 	 able 	 	to	see	most	 color 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	i	wear	gray	and	black	most	of	the	time	,	and	i	have	to	take	my	wife	with	me	to	chose	 clothe 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'd	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 fight 	 er 	 	pilot	when	i	was	a	boy	.
i	 love 	 d 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 plane 	 s 	 	barrel	over	our	 holi 	 day 	 	home	in	the	 country 	 side 	 	.
and	it	was	my	 boy 	 hood 	 	dream	to	be	a	 fight 	 er 	 	pilot	.
and	i	did	the	 test 	 s 	 	in	the	royal	air	force	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	pilot	,	and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	i	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
i	could	n't	see	all	the	 blink 	 ing 	 	different	 light 	 s 	 	,	and	i	ca	n't	distinguish	color	.
so	i	had	to	 choos 	 e 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 care 	 er 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	in	fact	 relat 	 ively 	 	easy	for	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	an	 a 	 bid 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	all	the	way	through	my	 child 	 hood 	 	,	which	was	 inter 	 national 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	i	read	the	 news 	 paper 	 	 thorough 	 ly 	 	.
i	was	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	the	cold	war	,	by	the	inf	 negoti 	 ations 	 	over	 inter 	 mediate 	 	-	range	nuclear	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 s 	 	,	the	 pr 	 oxy 	 	war	between	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	and	the	u.s	.
in	angola	or	afghanistan	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	me	.
and	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	at	an	early	age	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	diplomat	.
and	i	,	one	day	,	i	 announce 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	my	 parent 	 s 	 	--	and	my	father	 deni 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 d 	 addy 	 	,	i	want	to	be	a	diplomat	.	``
and	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	carne	,	you	have	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	to	be	a	diplomat	.	``
and	my	 ambit 	 ion 	 	was	 seal 	 ed 	 	.
in	1989	,	i	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	british	foreign	service	.
that	year	,	5,000	people	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	diplomat	,	and	20	of	us	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	suggest	,	i	was	 in 	 duct 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	elite	and	 fasci 	 nating 	 	and	 exhila 	 rating 	 	world	.
 be 	 ing 	 	a	diplomat	,	then	and	now	,	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	job	,	and	i	 love 	 d 	 	every	minute	of	it	--	i	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	the	 stat 	 us 	 	of	it	.
i	 b 	 ought 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	nice	suit	and	 wo 	 re 	 	leather	-	soled	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	 revel 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	access	i	had	to	world	 event 	 s 	 	.
i	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	the	gaza	strip	.
i	headed	the	middle	east	peace	process	section	in	the	british	foreign	 mini 	 stry 	 	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	a	 speech 	 writer 	 	for	the	british	foreign	 secret 	 ary 	 	.
i	met	yasser	arafat	.
i	 negoti 	 ated 	 	with	saddam	's	 diplomat 	 s 	 	at	the	u.n	.
 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	kabul	and	 serv 	 ed 	 	in	afghanistan	after	the	fall	of	the	taliban	.
and	i	would	travel	in	a	c	-	130	transport	and	go	and	visit	 war 	 lord 	 s 	 	in	mountain	 hide 	 away 	 s 	 	and	 negoti 	 ate 	 	with	them	about	how	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	al	qaeda	from	afghanistan	,	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	my	special	 force 	 s 	 	 es 	 cort 	 	,	who	,	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	had	to	have	an	 es 	 cort 	 	of	a	 plat 	 oon 	 	of	royal	marines	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	so	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
and	that	was	 excit 	 ing 	 	--	that	was	 f 	 un 	 	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	a	great	 cad 	 re 	 	of	people	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	close	-	knit	community	of	people	.
and	the	pinnacle	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	was	when	i	was	 post 	 ed 	 	to	new	york	.
i	'd	 al 	 ready 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	in	germany	,	norway	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	other	 place 	 s 	 	,	but	i	was	 post 	 ed 	 	to	new	york	to	serve	on	the	u.n.	security	council	for	the	british	 deleg 	 ation 	 	.
and	my	 respons 	 ibility 	 	was	the	middle	east	,	which	was	my	 special 	 ty 	 	.
and	there	,	i	 deal 	 t 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	middle	east	peace	process	,	the	lockerbie	issue	--	we	can	talk	about	that	 lat 	 er 	 	,	if	you	wish	--	but	above	all	,	my	 respons 	 ibility 	 	was	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	and	the	 sanct 	 ions 	 	we	 place 	 d 	 	on	 ir 	 aq 	 	to	 oblig 	 e 	 	it	to	 dis 	 arm 	 	 it 	 self 	 	of	these	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
i	was	the	chief	british	 negoti 	 ator 	 	on	the	subject	,	and	i	was	 steep 	 ed 	 	in	the	issue	.
and	 any 	 way 	 	,	my	tour	--	it	was	kind	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	time	.
i	mean	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 diploma 	 cy 	 	.
we	went	through	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 war 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	time	in	new	york	.
i	 negoti 	 ated 	 	for	my	country	the	 re 	 solution 	 	in	the	security	council	of	the	12th	of	september	2001	 condemn 	 ing 	 	the	 attack 	 s 	 	of	the	day	before	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	,	of	course	,	 deep 	 ly 	 	present	to	us	 actual 	 ly 	 	living	in	new	york	at	the	time	.
so	it	was	kind	of	the	best	of	time	,	worst	of	 time 	 s 	 	kind	of	experience	.
i	lived	the	high	-	life	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	 work 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 hour 	 s 	 	,	i	lived	in	a	 pent 	 house 	 	in	 un 	 ion 	 	square	.
i	was	a	single	british	diplomat	in	new	york	city	;	you	can	imagine	what	that	might	have	 me 	 ant 	 	.
i	had	a	good	time	.
but	in	2002	,	when	my	tour	came	to	an	end	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	was	n't	going	to	go	back	to	the	job	that	was	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	me	in	london	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	a	sabbatical	,	in	fact	,	at	the	new	school	,	bruce	.
in	some	 inch 	 o 	 ate 	 	,	 in 	 articulate 	 	way	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	my	work	,	with	me	.
i	was	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 dis 	 illusion 	 ed 	 	in	a	way	i	could	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	put	my	finger	on	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	some	time	out	from	work	.
the	foreign	 off 	 ice 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	.
you	could	take	these	special	 un 	 paid 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	 call 	 ed 	 	them	,	and	yet	remain	part	of	the	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	service	,	but	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	any	work	.
it	was	nice	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	a	 second 	 ment 	 	to	join	the	u.n.	in	kosovo	,	which	was	then	under	u.n.	 administr 	 ation 	 	.
and	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	kosovo	,	which	kind	of	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 show 	 s 	 	the	 random 	 ness 	 	of	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	two	of	the	 pivot 	 s 	 	of	my	life	and	 help 	 ed 	 	to	deliver	me	to	the	next	stage	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	random	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	was	that	,	in	the	summer	of	2004	,	the	british	government	,	 some 	 what 	 	 reluct 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	have	an	official	 inquir 	 y 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	use	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	on	wmd	in	the	run	up	to	the	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	subject	.
and	i	 test 	 ified 	 	to	that	 inquir 	 y 	 	in	secret	.
i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 steep 	 ed 	 	in	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	on	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	wmd	,	and	my	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	to	the	 inquir 	 y 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	:	that	the	government	 exagge 	 rated 	 	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	which	was	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	in	all	the	 year 	 s 	 	i	'd	read	it	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	our	own	internal	 assess 	 ment 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	that	 ir 	 aq 	 	's	wmd	did	not	pose	a	threat	to	 it 	 s 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	let	 al 	 one 	 	to	us	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	the	government	had	 ignor 	 ed 	 	all	 avail 	 able 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	to	war	,	which	in	some	ways	was	a	more	 dis 	 credit 	 able 	 	thing	still	.
the	third	reason	,	i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	i	 g 	 ave 	 	that	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	,	and	that	 present 	 ed 	 	me	with	a	crisis	.
what	was	i	going	to	do	?
 th 	 is 	 	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	was	 deep 	 ly 	 	critical	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	of	my	 mini 	 sters 	 	,	who	had	,	in	my	view	had	 perpet 	 rated 	 	a	war	on	a	 false 	 hood 	 	.
and	so	i	was	in	crisis	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	thing	.
i	 moan 	 ed 	 	about	it	,	i	 hesit 	 ated 	 	,	i	went	on	and	on	and	on	to	my	long	-	 suffer 	 ing 	 	wife	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 re 	 sign 	 	from	the	british	foreign	service	.
i	felt	--	there	's	a	scene	in	the	al	pacino	movie	``	the	 insid 	 er 	 	,	``	which	you	may	know	,	where	he	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	cbs	after	they	've	let	him	down	over	the	tobacco	guy	,	and	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	just	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.	 some 	 thing 	 	's	broken	.	``
and	it	was	like	that	for	me	.	i	love	that	movie	.
i	felt	just	 some 	 thing 	 	's	broken	.
i	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 it 	 	with	my	foreign	 mini 	 ster 	 	or	my	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	with	a	 s 	 mile 	 	on	my	face	and	do	what	i	used	to	do	 glad 	 ly 	 	for	them	.
so	took	a	running	leap	and	 jump 	 ed 	 	over	the	edge	of	a	cliff	.
and	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	fall	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	fall	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 stop 	 ped 	 	;	i	'm	still	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
but	,	in	a	way	,	i	've	got	used	to	the	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	it	.
and	in	a	way	,	i	kind	of	like	the	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	it	a	lot	better	than	i	like	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	top	of	the	cliff	,	 wonder 	 ing 	 	what	to	do	.
a	second	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	kosovo	,	which	kind	of	--	i	need	a	quick	gulp	of	water	,	forgive	me	.
a	second	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	kosovo	,	which	kind	of	 deliver 	 ed 	 	the	answer	,	which	i	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	answer	,	which	is	,	``	what	do	i	do	with	my	life	?	``
i	love	 diploma 	 cy 	 	--	i	have	no	 care 	 er 	 	--	i	 expect 	 ed 	 	my	entire	life	to	be	a	diplomat	,	to	be	 serv 	 ing 	 	my	country	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	an	ambassador	,	and	my	 mentor 	 s 	 	,	my	heroes	,	people	who	got	to	the	top	of	my	profession	,	and	here	i	was	 throw 	 ing 	 	it	all	away	.
a	lot	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	still	in	it	.
my	pension	was	in	it	.
and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	it	up	.
and	what	was	i	going	to	do	?
and	that	year	,	in	kosovo	,	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	which	i	saw	.
in	march	2004	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 riot 	 s 	 	all	over	the	 pro 	 vince 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	it	then	was	--	of	kosovo	.
18	people	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	 anarch 	 y 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	thing	to	see	 anarch 	 y 	 	,	to	know	that	the	police	and	the	 militar 	 y 	 	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 militar 	 y 	 	 troop 	 s 	 	there	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	ca	n't	stop	that	 ramp 	 aging 	 	mob	who	's	coming	down	the	street	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	 ramp 	 aging 	 	mob	coming	down	the	street	will	stop	is	when	they	decide	to	stop	and	when	they	've	had	 en 	 ough 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	and	 kill 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	is	not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	 feel 	 ing 	 	to	see	,	and	i	saw	it	.
and	i	went	through	it	.	i	went	through	 t 	 hose 	 	 mob 	 s 	 	.
and	with	my	albanian	 friend 	 s 	 	,	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	stop	it	,	but	we	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	riot	taught	me	 some 	 thing 	 	,	which	is	n't	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	obvious	and	it	's	kind	of	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	story	.
but	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	that	riot	took	place	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 riot 	 s 	 	,	which	went	on	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	took	place	--	was	 be 	 cause 	 	the	kosovo	people	 we 	 re 	 	 dis 	 enfranchis 	 ed 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	own	future	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	 negoti 	 ations 	 	about	the	future	of	kosovo	going	on	then	,	and	the	kosovo	government	,	let	 al 	 one 	 	the	kosovo	people	,	 we 	 re 	 	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	.
there	was	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 f 	 ancy 	 	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	system	,	 th 	 is 	 	 negoti 	 ation 	 	process	about	the	future	of	kosovo	,	and	the	kosovars	 we 	 re 	 	n't	part	of	it	.
and	 funni 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	about	that	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 riot 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	part	of	the	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	that	 frust 	 ration 	 	.
it	was	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	reason	,	and	life	is	not	simple	,	one	reason	 narrative 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	and	i	'm	not	 pretend 	 ing 	 	it	was	more	simple	than	it	was	.
but	that	was	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	.
and	that	kind	of	 g 	 ave 	 	me	the	inspiration	--	or	 ra 	 ther 	 	to	be	precise	,	it	 g 	 ave 	 	my	wife	the	inspiration	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	you	advise	the	kosovars	?
why	do	n't	you	advise	 the 	 ir 	 	government	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 diploma 	 cy 	 	?	``
and	the	kosovars	 we 	 re 	 	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	a	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	service	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	 diplomat 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	a	foreign	 off 	 ice 	 	to	help	them	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	 immense 	 ly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	process	,	which	 be 	 came 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	final	 stat 	 us 	 	process	of	kosovo	.
and	so	that	was	the	idea	.
that	was	the	origin	of	the	thing	that	 be 	 came 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	,	the	world	's	first	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	 advisor 	 y 	 	group	and	a	non	-	profit	to	boot	.
and	it	 beg 	 an 	 	when	i	flew	back	from	london	after	my	time	at	the	u.n.	in	kosovo	.
i	flew	back	and	had	 d 	 inner 	 	with	the	kosovo	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	``	look	,	i	'm	 pro 	 posing 	 	that	i	come	and	advise	you	on	the	 diploma 	 cy 	 	.
i	know	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	it	's	what	i	do	.	why	do	n't	i	come	and	help	you	?	``
and	he	raised	his	glass	of	 r 	 aki 	 	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	carne	.	come	.	``
and	i	came	to	kosovo	and	 advise 	 d 	 	the	kosovo	government	.
 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	three	 success 	 ive 	 	kosovo	prime	 mini 	 sters 	 	and	the	multi	-	party	 negoti 	 ation 	 	team	of	kosovo	.
and	kosovo	 be 	 came 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	.
 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	is	now	 establish 	 ed 	 	in	five	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	 center 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	and	we	're	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	seven	or	eight	different	 count 	 ries 	 	,	or	 politic 	 al 	 	 group 	 s 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	you	wish	to	define	them	--	and	i	'm	not	big	on	 definition 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	the	 north 	 ern 	 	cypriots	on	how	to	 re 	 un 	 ify 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 is 	 land 	 	.
we	're	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	the	burmese	 op 	 position 	 	,	the	government	of	southern	sudan	,	which	--	you	heard	it	here	first	--	is	going	to	be	a	new	country	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	the	polisario	front	of	the	western	sahara	,	who	are	 fight 	 ing 	 	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	country	back	from	moroccan	occupation	after	34	 year 	 s 	 	of	 dispos 	 session 	 	.
we	're	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 is 	 land 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	the	climate	change	 negoti 	 ations 	 	,	which	is	suppose	to	 culmin 	 ate 	 	in	copenhagen	.
there	's	a	bit	of	 random 	 ness 	 	here	too	 be 	 cause 	 	,	when	i	was	 begin 	 ning 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	,	i	went	to	a	party	in	the	house	of	 lord 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	place	,	but	i	was	 hold 	 ing 	 	my	drink	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	 bump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	who	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	me	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	--	i	told	him	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	told	him	 ra 	 ther 	 	 grand 	 ly 	 	i	was	going	to	establish	 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	in	new	york	.
at	that	time	there	was	just	me	--	and	me	and	my	wife	 we 	 re 	 	moving	back	to	new	york	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	you	see	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	new	york	?	``
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	he	 work 	 ed 	 	for	an	 innov 	 ation 	 	company	 call 	 ed 	 	?	what	if	!	,	which	some	of	you	have	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	of	.
and	one	thing	led	to	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	desk	in	?	what	if	!	in	new	york	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	.
and	 watch 	 ing 	 	?	what	if	!

and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	there	are	different	ways	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 diploma 	 cy 	 	--	that	 diploma 	 cy 	 	,	like	business	,	is	a	business	of	solving	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	yet	the	word	 innov 	 ation 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	in	 diploma 	 cy 	 	;	it	's	all	zero	sum	 game 	 s 	 	and	 real 	 poli 	 ti 	 k 	 	and	ancient	 institution 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	there	for	 generation 	 s 	 	and	do	 thing 	 s 	 	the	same	way	they	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	tries	to	 in 	 corporate 	 	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	at	?	what	if	!	.
we	all	 s 	 it 	 	in	one	 off 	 ice 	 	and	shout	at	each	other	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
we	all	work	on	little	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	and	try	to	move	 desk 	 s 	 	to	change	the	way	we	think	.
and	we	use	naive	 expert 	 s 	 	who	may	know	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	the	 count 	 ries 	 	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	,	but	may	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	else	to	try	to	inject	new	 think 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	try	to	address	for	our	 client 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	easy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 client 	 s 	 	,	by	definition	,	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	difficult	time	,	 diplomat 	 ically 	 	.
there	are	,	i	do	n't	know	,	some	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	from	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	personal	and	 politic 	 al 	 	--	and	in	a	way	,	they	're	the	same	thing	.
the	personal	one	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	off	a	cliff	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	good	thing	,	and	i	recommend	it	.
and	it	's	a	good	thing	to	do	at	 l 	 east 	 	once	in	your	life	just	to	tear	 every 	 thing 	 	up	and	jump	.
the	second	thing	is	a	 big 	 ger 	 	 less 	 on 	 	about	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	is	part	of	a	trend	which	is	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	and	evident	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	which	is	that	the	world	is	 fragment 	 ing 	 	.
 state 	 s 	 	mean	less	than	they	used	to	,	and	the	power	of	the	state	is	 dec 	 lining 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	the	power	of	 other 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 call 	 ed 	 	non	-	state	 act 	 ors 	 	.
they	may	be	 corporation 	 s 	 	,	they	may	be	mafiosi	,	they	may	be	nice	ngos	,	they	may	 any 	 thing 	 	,	any	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	are	living	in	a	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	and	 fragment 	 ed 	 	world	.
if	 government 	 s 	 	are	less	able	to	affect	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	affect	us	in	the	world	,	then	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	who	is	left	to	deal	with	them	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	to	take	 great 	 er 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	deal	with	them	?
us	.
if	they	ca	n't	do	it	,	who	's	left	to	deal	with	it	?
we	have	no	choice	but	to	embrace	that	 re 	 ality 	 	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	it	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	good	 en 	 ough 	 	to	say	that	 inter 	 national 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	,	or	global	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	,	or	 cha 	 os 	 	in	somalia	,	or	what	's	going	on	in	burma	is	 non 	 e 	 	of	your	business	,	and	that	you	can	 leav 	 e 	 	it	to	 government 	 s 	 	to	get	on	with	.
i	can	connect	any	one	of	you	by	six	 degree 	 s 	 	of	 separat 	 ion 	 	to	the	al-shabaab	militia	in	somalia	.
ask	me	how	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	if	you	eat	fish	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	but	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	there	.
we	are	all	 intima 	 te 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	just	tom	friedman	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 prov 	 able 	 	in	case	after	case	after	case	.
what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 ask 	 ing 	 	your	 politic 	 ians 	 	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	look	to	 your 	 self 	 	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	is	a	kind	of	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	sort	of	loose	way	.
there	are	n't	neat	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	but	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	way	the	world	is	changing	is	 embodi 	 ed 	 	in	what	's	going	on	at	the	place	i	used	to	work	--	the	u.n.	security	council	.
the	u.n.	was	 establish 	 ed 	 	in	1945	.
 it 	 s 	 	 chart 	 er 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	designed	to	stop	 conflict 	 s 	 	between	 state 	 s 	 	--	 inter 	 state 	 	conflict	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	80	percent	of	the	agenda	of	the	u.n.	security	council	is	about	 conflict 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	non	-	state	 part 	 ies 	 	--	 guerilla 	 s 	 	,	 separat 	 ists 	 	,	 terrorist 	 s 	 	,	if	you	want	to	call	them	that	,	people	who	are	not	normal	 government 	 s 	 	,	who	are	not	normal	 state 	 s 	 	.
that	is	the	state	of	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
when	i	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	when	i	look	back	on	my	time	at	the	security	council	and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	the	kosovars	,	and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	often	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	most	 direct 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	security	council	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	,	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	give	 the 	 ir 	 	 view 	 s 	 	to	the	security	council	,	i	thought	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	wrong	.
 some 	 thing 	 	's	got	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	off	in	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	mode	.
me	and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	at	 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	went	around	the	u.n.	security	council	.
we	went	around	70	u.n.	member	 state 	 s 	 	--	the	kazaks	,	the	ethiopians	,	the	israelis	--	you	name	them	,	we	went	to	see	them	--	the	 secret 	 ary 	 	general	,	all	of	them	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	wrong	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 terr 	 ible 	 	that	you	do	n't	consult	these	people	who	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
you	've	got	to	 institution 	 al 	 ize 	 	a	system	where	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invit 	 e 	 	the	kosovars	to	come	and	tell	you	what	they	think	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	allow	you	to	tell	me	--	you	can	tell	them	what	you	think	.
it	'll	be	great	.	you	can	have	an	 ex 	 change 	 	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 corporate 	 	these	people	's	 view 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	 decision 	 s 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	your	 decision 	 s 	 	will	be	more	effective	and	 dur 	 able 	 	.	``
super	-	logical	,	you	would	think	.
i	mean	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	logical	.	so	obvious	,	 any 	 body 	 	could	get	it	.
and	of	course	,	 every 	 body 	 	got	it	.	 every 	 body 	 	went	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	of	course	,	you	're	 absolute 	 ly 	 	right	.
come	back	to	us	in	 may 	 be 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	.	``
and	of	course	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	 no 	 body 	 	did	 any 	 thing 	 	.
the	security	council	 do 	 es 	 	 it 	 s 	 	business	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	 to 	 day 	 	that	it	did	x	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	was	there	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	that	 observ 	 ation 	 	of	 bas 	 ically 	 	failure	and	thought	,	what	can	we	do	about	it	.
and	i	thought	,	i	'm	 bugger 	 ed 	 	if	i	'm	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	rest	of	my	life	 lobby 	 ing 	 	for	these	crummy	 government 	 s 	 	to	do	what	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
so	what	we	're	going	to	do	is	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	set	up	these	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	now	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	is	in	the	process	of	setting	up	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	between	the	u.n.	security	council	and	the	 part 	 ies 	 	to	the	 disput 	 es 	 	that	are	on	the	agenda	of	the	security	council	.
so	we	will	be	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	darfuri	rebel	 group 	 s 	 	,	the	 north 	 ern 	 	cypriots	and	the	southern	cypriots	,	 rebel 	 s 	 	from	aceh	,	and	awful	long	 laundr 	 y 	 	list	of	chaotic	 conflict 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
and	we	will	be	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 part 	 ies 	 	to	new	york	to	 s 	 it 	 	down	in	a	quiet	room	in	a	private	setting	with	no	press	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	explain	what	they	want	to	the	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	u.	n.	security	council	,	and	for	the	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	u.n.	security	council	to	explain	to	them	what	they	want	.
so	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	conversation	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	never	before	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	of	course	,	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	any	of	you	who	know	 politic 	 s 	 	will	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	difficult	,	and	i	 entire 	 ly 	 	agree	with	you	.
the	 chance 	 s 	 	of	failure	are	 ver 	 y 	 	high	,	but	it	 certain 	 ly 	 	wo	n't	happen	if	we	do	n't	try	to	make	it	happen	.
and	my	 politic 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	from	when	i	was	a	diplomat	to	what	i	am	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	i	think	that	 out 	 put 	 s 	 	is	what	 matter 	 s 	 	,	not	process	,	not	technology	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	so	much	either	.
preach	technology	to	all	the	 t 	 wit 	 tering 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	all	the	iranian	 demonst 	 ration 	 s 	 	who	are	now	in	 politic 	 al 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	in	tehran	,	where	ahmadinejad	 remain 	 s 	 	in	power	.
technology	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	change	in	iran	.
you	've	got	to	look	at	the	 out 	 put 	 s 	 	,	and	you	got	to	say	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	what	can	i	do	to	produce	that	 part 	 icular 	 	 out 	 put 	 	?	``
that	is	the	 politic 	 s 	 	of	the	21st	century	,	and	in	a	way	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	diplomat	 embodi 	 es 	 	that	 fragment 	 ation 	 	,	that	change	,	that	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	all	of	us	.
that	's	my	story	.	 thank 	 s 	 	.
