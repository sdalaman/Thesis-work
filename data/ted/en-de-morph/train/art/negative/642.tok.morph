thank	you	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	stood	on	the	ted	stage	in	arusha	,	tanzania	.
i	spoke	 ver 	 y 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	about	one	of	my	 proud 	 est 	 	 creation 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	simple	machine	that	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	.
before	that	time	,	i	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	away	from	my	home	in	malawi	.
i	had	never	used	a	computer	.
i	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	an	 inter 	 net 	 	.
on	the	stage	that	day	,	i	was	so	nervous	.
my	english	lost	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	vomit	.
i	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	so	 man 	 y 	 	azungu	,	white	people	.
there	was	a	story	i	would	n't	tell	you	then	.
but	well	,	i	'm	 feel 	 ing 	 	good	right	now	.
i	would	like	to	share	that	story	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	have	seven	children	in	my	family	.
all	 sister 	 s 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 ing 	 	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	me	with	my	dad	when	i	was	a	little	boy	.
before	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	 wonder 	 s 	 	of	science	,	i	was	just	a	simple	 farm 	 er 	 	in	a	country	of	poor	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
like	 every 	 one 	 	else	,	we	grew	 ma 	 ize 	 	.
one	year	our	fortune	 turn 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	.
in	2001	we	 experience 	 d 	 	an	awful	famine	.
 with 	 in 	 	five	 month 	 s 	 	all	malawians	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 starv 	 e 	 	to	death	.
my	family	ate	one	meal	per	day	,	at	night	.
 on 	 ly 	 	three	 swallow 	 s 	 	of	 ns 	 ima 	 	for	each	one	of	us	.
the	food	 pass 	 es 	 	through	our	bodies	.
we	drop	down	to	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
in	malawi	,	the	 second 	 ary 	 	school	,	you	have	to	pay	school	 fee 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 hung 	 er 	 	,	i	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	drop	out	of	school	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	my	father	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 t 	 hose 	 	dry	 field 	 s 	 	.
it	was	the	future	i	could	n't	accept	.
i	felt	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	be	at	the	 second 	 ary 	 	school	,	so	i	was	 determine 	 d 	 	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	possible	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	education	.
so	i	went	to	a	library	.
i	read	 book 	 s 	 	,	science	 book 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	physics	.
i	could	n't	read	english	that	well	.
i	used	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	and	 picture 	 s 	 	to	learn	the	 word 	 s 	 	around	them	.
 an 	 other 	 	book	put	that	knowledge	in	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
it	 s 	 aid 	 	a	 wind 	 mill 	 	could	pump	water	and	generate	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
pump	water	 me 	 ant 	 	 irrig 	 ation 	 	,	a	defense	against	 hung 	 er 	 	,	which	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	by	that	time	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	would	build	one	 wind 	 mill 	 	for	 my 	 self 	 	.
but	i	did	n't	have	 material 	 s 	 	to	use	,	so	i	went	to	a	scrap	yard	where	i	found	my	 material 	 s 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	my	mother	,	 s 	 aid 	 	i	was	crazy	.
i	found	a	 tract 	 or 	 	fan	,	shock	 absorb 	 er 	 	,	pvc	 pipe 	 s 	 	.
using	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	frame	and	an	old	 bi 	 cycle 	 	 dynam 	 o 	 	,	i	built	my	machine	.
it	was	one	light	at	first	.
and	then	four	 light 	 s 	 	,	with	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	,	and	even	a	circuit	breaker	,	 model 	 ed 	 	after	an	electric	bell	.
 an 	 other 	 	machine	 pump 	 s 	 	water	for	 irrig 	 ation 	 	.
 queue 	 s 	 	of	people	start	lining	up	at	my	house	to	charge	 the 	 ir 	 	mobile	phone	.
i	could	not	get	rid	of	them	.
and	the	 report 	 ers 	 	came	too	,	which	lead	to	 blogger 	 s 	 	and	which	lead	to	a	call	from	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	ted	.
i	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	an	 air 	 plane 	 	before	.
i	had	never	slept	in	a	hotel	.
so	,	on	stage	that	day	in	arusha	,	my	english	lost	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	``	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	.	and	i	made	it	.	``
so	i	would	like	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	to	all	the	people	out	there	like	me	to	the	africans	,	and	the	poor	who	are	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	your	 dream 	 s 	 	.
god	bless	.
 may 	 be 	 	one	day	you	will	watch	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
i	say	to	you	,	trust	 your 	 self 	 	and	 believ 	 e 	 	.
 what 	 ever 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	give	up	.
thank	you	.
