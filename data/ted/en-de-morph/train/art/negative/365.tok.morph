but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	world	where	 socie 	 ties 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	sign	of	a	major	collapse	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	japan	,	java	,	tonga	and	tikopea	.	so	 evident 	 ly 	 	,	 socie 	 ties 	 	in	some	 area 	 s 	 	are	more	fragile	than	in	other	 area 	 s 	 	.
how	can	we	understand	what	 make 	 s 	 	some	 socie 	 ties 	 	more	fragile	than	other	 socie 	 ties 	 	?	the	problem	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	relevant	to	our	 situ 	 ation 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	there	are	some	 socie 	 ties 	 	that	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	somalia	and	rwanda	and	the	 form 	 er 	 	yugoslavia	.	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	may	be	close	to	collapse	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	nepal	,	indonesia	and	columbia	.

 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	is	not	going	to	be	a	single	factor	.	if	 any 	 one 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	there	is	a	single	-	factor	 explan 	 ation 	 	for	 socie 	 tal 	 	 collapse 	 s 	 	,	you	know	right	away	that	they	're	an	idiot	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	complex	subject	.

in	 analyz 	 ing 	 	 socie 	 tal 	 	 collapse 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	a	five	-	point	 frame 	 work 	 	--	a	 check 	 list 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	go	through	to	try	and	understand	 collapse 	 s 	 	.	and	i	'll	 illustr 	 ate 	 	that	five	-	point	 frame 	 work 	 	by	the	 extinct 	 ion 	 	of	the	greenland	norse	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	european	 socie 	 ty 	 	with	 liter 	 ate 	 	 record 	 s 	 	,	so	we	know	a	good	deal	about	the	people	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 motiv 	 ation 	 	.
in	ad	984	vikings	went	out	to	greenland	,	 settl 	 ed 	 	greenland	,	and	around	1450	they	 di 	 ed 	 	out	--	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	,	and	every	one	of	them	 end 	 ed 	 	up	dead	.
why	did	they	all	end	up	dead	?	well	,	in	my	five	-	point	 frame 	 work 	 	,	the	first	item	on	the	 frame 	 work 	 	is	to	look	for	human	 impact 	 s 	 	on	the	environment	:	people	 in 	 advert 	 ent 	 ly 	 	 destroy 	 ing 	 	the	resource	base	on	which	they	depend	.	and	in	the	case	of	the	viking	norse	,	the	vikings	 in 	 advert 	 ent 	 ly 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	and	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	,	which	was	a	 part 	 icular 	 	problem	for	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 requir 	 ed 	 	 forest 	 s 	 	to	make	 char 	 coal 	 	,	to	make	iron	.
so	they	 end 	 ed 	 	up	an	iron	age	european	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 un 	 able 	 	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	iron	.	a	second	item	on	my	 check 	 list 	 	is	climate	change	.	climate	can	get	 warm 	 er 	 	or	 cold 	 er 	 	or	 dry 	 er 	 	or	 wet 	 ter 	 	.
in	the	case	of	the	vikings	--	in	greenland	,	the	climate	got	 cold 	 er 	 	in	the	late	1300s	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	the	1400s	.	but	a	cold	climate	is	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	fatal	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	inuit	--	the	eskimos	 inhabit 	 ing 	 	greenland	at	the	same	time	--	did	better	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	with	cold	 climate 	 s 	 	.	so	why	did	n't	the	greenland	norse	 a 	 s 	 	well	?
the	third	thing	on	my	 check 	 list 	 	is	 relation 	 s 	 	with	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	friendly	 socie 	 ties 	 	that	may	prop	up	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	.	and	if	that	friendly	support	is	 pull 	 ed 	 	away	,	that	may	make	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	collapse	.	in	the	case	of	the	greenland	norse	,	they	had	trade	with	the	mother	country	--	norway	--	and	that	trade	 dwindl 	 ed 	 	:	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	norway	got	 weak 	 er 	 	,	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	sea	ice	between	greenland	and	norway	.
the	fourth	item	on	my	 check 	 list 	 	is	 relation 	 s 	 	with	 hostil 	 e 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
in	the	case	of	norse	greenland	,	the	 hostil 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	inuit	--	the	eskimos	sharing	greenland	--	with	whom	the	norse	got	off	to	bad	 relationship 	 s 	 	.	and	we	know	that	the	inuit	 kill 	 ed 	 	the	norse	and	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	of	 great 	 er 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	,	may	have	 block 	 ed 	 	access	to	the	 out 	 er 	 	 fjord 	 s 	 	,	on	which	the	norse	 depend 	 ed 	 	for	 seal 	 s 	 	at	a	critical	time	of	the	year	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	fifth	item	on	my	 check 	 list 	 	is	the	 politic 	 al 	 	,	economic	,	social	and	cultural	 factor 	 s 	 	in	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	make	it	more	or	less	 like 	 ly 	 	that	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	will	perceive	and	solve	 it 	 s 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.	in	the	case	of	the	greenland	norse	,	cultural	 factor 	 s 	 	that	made	it	difficult	for	them	to	solve	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	:	 the 	 ir 	 	 commit 	 ments 	 	to	a	christian	 socie 	 ty 	 	 invest 	 ing 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	in	 cat 	 hedral 	 s 	 	;	 the 	 ir 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	competitive	-	 rank 	 ed 	 	 chief 	 ly 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	;	and	 the 	 ir 	 	scorn	for	the	inuit	,	from	whom	they	 re 	 fused 	 	to	learn	.	so	that	's	how	the	five	-	part	 frame 	 work 	 	is	relevant	to	the	collapse	and	 event 	 ual 	 	 extinct 	 ion 	 	of	the	greenland	norse	.
what	about	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?
for	the	past	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	taking	my	wife	and	 kid 	 s 	 	to	southwestern	montana	,	where	i	 work 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	teenager	on	the	hay	harvest	.	and	montana	,	at	first	sight	,	 seem 	 s 	 	like	the	most	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	environment	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
but	scratch	the	surface	,	and	montana	 suffer 	 s 	 	from	serious	 problem 	 s 	 	.
going	through	the	same	 check 	 list 	 	:	human	 environment 	 al 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 cute 	 	in	montana	.	toxic	 problem 	 s 	 	from	mine	waste	have	 caus 	 ed 	 	damage	of	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	.

third	thing	on	my	 check 	 list 	 	:	 relation 	 s 	 	with	 friend 	 lies 	 	that	can	sustain	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.	in	montana	 to 	 day 	 	,	more	than	half	of	the	income	of	montana	is	not	 earn 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	montana	,	but	is	derived	from	out	of	state	:	transfer	 payment 	 s 	 	from	social	security	,	 invest 	 ments 	 	and	so	on	--	which	 make 	 s 	 	montana	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	the	rest	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
fourth	:	 relation 	 s 	 	with	 hostil 	 es 	 	.	montanans	have	the	same	 problem 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	do	all	americans	,	in	 be 	 ing 	 	sensitive	to	 problem 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	 hostil 	 es 	 	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	our	oil	 suppli 	 es 	 	,	and	terrorist	 attack 	 s 	 	.	and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	last	item	on	my	 check 	 list 	 	:	question	of	how	 politic 	 al 	 	,	economic	,	social	,	cultural	 attitude 	 s 	 	play	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	montanans	have	long	-	held	 value 	 s 	 	,	which	 to 	 day 	 	seem	to	be	 get 	 ting 	 	in	the	way	of	 the 	 ir 	 	solving	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 problem 	 s 	 	.
long	-	held	devotion	to	logging	and	to	 mine 	 s 	 	and	to	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	and	to	no	government	 regulat 	 ion 	 	;	 value 	 s 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	well	in	the	past	,	but	they	do	n't	seem	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	well	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	looking	at	these	 issue 	 s 	 	of	 collapse 	 s 	 	for	a	lot	of	past	 socie 	 ties 	 	and	for	 man 	 y 	 	present	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
are	there	any	general	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	that	arise	?
in	a	way	,	just	like	tolstoy	's	 state 	 ment 	 	about	every	 un 	 happy 	 	marriage	 be 	 ing 	 	different	,	every	 collapse 	 d 	 	or	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	different	--	they	all	have	different	 detail 	 s 	 	.	but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	there	are	certain	common	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	that	emerge	from	these	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	of	past	 socie 	 ties 	 	that	did	or	did	not	collapse	and	 threaten 	 ed 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.	one	 interest 	 ing 	 	common	 th 	 read 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	the	 rapid 	 ity 	 	of	collapse	after	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	 reach 	 es 	 	 it 	 s 	 	peak	.	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	that	do	n't	wind	down	 gradu 	 ally 	 	,	but	they	build	up	--	get	 rich 	 er 	 	and	more	 power 	 ful 	 	--	and	then	 with 	 in 	 	a	short	time	,	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	after	 the 	 ir 	 	peak	,	they	collapse	.	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	classic	lowland	maya	of	the	yucatan	 beg 	 an 	 	to	collapse	in	the	early	800s	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	after	the	maya	 we 	 re 	 	building	 the 	 ir 	 	 big 	 gest 	 	 monument 	 s 	 	,	and	maya	population	was	 great 	 est 	 	.
or	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	collapse	of	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	took	place	 with 	 in 	 	a	couple	of	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	,	of	the	time	when	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	was	at	 it 	 s 	 	 great 	 est 	 	power	.
an	 analog 	 ue 	 	would	be	the	growth	of	bacteria	in	a	 pe 	 tri 	 	dish	.
these	rapid	 collapse 	 s 	 	are	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	where	there	's	a	 mis 	 match 	 	between	 avail 	 able 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	and	resource	consumption	,	or	a	 mis 	 match 	 	between	economic	 out 	 lay 	 s 	 	and	economic	potential	.
in	a	 pe 	 tri 	 	dish	,	bacteria	grow	.	say	they	double	every	generation	,	and	five	 generation 	 s 	 	before	the	end	the	 pe 	 tri 	 	dish	is	15/16ths	empty	,	and	then	the	next	generation	's	3/4ths	empty	,	and	the	next	generation	half	empty	.	 with 	 in 	 	one	generation	after	the	 pe 	 tri 	 	dish	still	 be 	 ing 	 	half	empty	,	it	is	full	.	there	's	no	more	food	and	the	bacteria	have	 collapse 	 d 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	frequent	theme	:	 socie 	 ties 	 	collapse	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	after	 reach 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	peak	in	power	.
what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	put	it	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	is	that	,	if	you	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	should	be	looking	not	at	the	value	of	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	function	--	the	wealth	 it 	 self 	 	--	but	you	should	be	looking	at	the	first	 deriv 	 ative 	 	and	the	second	 deriv 	 ative 	 s 	 	of	the	function	.	that	's	one	general	theme	.	a	second	general	theme	is	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	often	subtle	 environment 	 al 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	that	make	some	 socie 	 ties 	 	more	fragile	than	 other 	 s 	 	.	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	are	not	well	 under 	 stood 	 	.	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	why	is	it	that	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 pac 	 ific 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	why	did	easter	 is 	 land 	 	end	up	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	case	of	complete	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	?
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	about	nine	different	 environment 	 al 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	--	some	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	subtle	 one 	 s 	 	--	that	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	against	the	easter	islanders	,	and	they	involve	 fall 	 out 	 	of	 volcan 	 ic 	 	tephra	,	latitude	,	 rain 	 fall 	 	.	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	subtle	of	them	is	that	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	a	major	 in 	 put 	 	of	 nutrient 	 s 	 	which	 protect 	 s 	 	 is 	 land 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	is	from	the	 fall 	 out 	 	of	 continent 	 al 	 	dust	from	central	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
easter	,	of	all	 pac 	 ific 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 l 	 east 	 	 in 	 put 	 	of	dust	from	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	 re 	 storing 	 	the	 fertil 	 ity 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	.	but	that	's	a	factor	that	we	did	n't	even	appreciate	 un 	 til 	 	1999	.
so	,	some	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	for	subtle	 environment 	 al 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	are	more	fragile	than	 other 	 s 	 	.	and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	 general 	 ization 	 	.	i	'm	now	 teach 	 ing 	 	a	course	at	ucla	,	to	ucla	 under 	 graduate 	 s 	 	,	on	these	 collapse 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ties 	 	.	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 bug 	 s 	 	my	ucla	 under 	 graduate 	 	 student 	 s 	 	is	,	how	on	earth	did	these	 socie 	 ties 	 	not	see	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	?
how	could	the	easter	islanders	have	 de 	 forest 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	?
what	did	they	say	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	cutting	down	the	last	palm	tree	?
did	n't	they	see	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	?	how	could	 socie 	 ties 	 	not	perceive	 the 	 ir 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	on	the	 environment 	 s 	 	and	stop	in	time	?
and	i	would	expect	that	,	if	our	human	 civil 	 ization 	 	 car 	 ries 	 	on	,	then	 may 	 be 	 	in	the	next	century	people	will	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	why	on	earth	did	these	people	 to 	 day 	 	in	the	year	2003	not	see	the	obvious	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	and	take	 correct 	 ive 	 	action	?
it	 seem 	 s 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	in	the	past	.	in	the	future	,	it	'll	seem	 in 	 credible 	 	what	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.	and	so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	develop	a	 hierarch 	 ical 	 	set	of	 consider 	 ations 	 	about	why	 socie 	 ties 	 	fail	to	solve	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	--	why	they	fail	to	perceive	the	 problem 	 s 	 	or	,	if	they	perceive	them	,	why	they	fail	to	tackle	them	.	or	,	if	they	tackle	them	,	why	do	they	fail	to	succeed	in	solving	them	?
i	'll	just	 ment 	 ion 	 	two	 general 	 ization 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
one	 blue 	 print 	 	for	trouble	,	making	collapse	 like 	 ly 	 	,	is	where	there	is	a	conflict	of	interest	between	the	short	-	term	interest	of	the	decision	-	making	 elite 	 s 	 	and	the	long	-	term	interest	of	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	the	 elite 	 s 	 	are	able	to	insulate	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 action 	 s 	 	.	where	what	's	good	in	the	short	run	for	the	elite	is	bad	for	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	,	there	's	a	real	risk	of	the	elite	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	would	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	down	in	the	long	run	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	among	the	greenland	norse	--	a	competitive	rank	 socie 	 ty 	 	--	what	the	 chief 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	is	more	 follow 	 ers 	 	and	more	sheep	and	more	 resource 	 s 	 	to	 out 	 compete 	 	the	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	 chief 	 s 	 	.	and	that	led	the	 chief 	 s 	 	to	do	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 f 	 logging 	 	the	land	:	 over 	 stock 	 ing 	 	the	land	,	forcing	 ten 	 ant 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 depend 	 ency 	 	.	and	that	made	the	 chief 	 s 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	in	the	short	run	,	but	led	to	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	's	collapse	in	the	long	run	.
 t 	 hose 	 	same	 issue 	 s 	 	of	 conflict 	 s 	 	of	interest	are	 a 	 cute 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	decision	makers	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	are	 frequent 	 ly 	 	able	to	insulate	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	by	living	in	gated	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	,	by	 drink 	 ing 	 	 bottle 	 d 	 	water	and	so	on	.	and	 with 	 in 	 	the	last	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	obvious	that	the	elite	in	the	business	world	 correct 	 ly 	 	perceive	that	they	can	advance	 the 	 ir 	 	short	-	term	interest	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	good	for	them	but	bad	for	 socie 	 ty 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 drain 	 ing 	 	a	few	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	out	of	enron	and	other	 business 	 es 	 	.	they	are	 quit 	 e 	 	correct	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	good	for	them	in	the	short	term	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	bad	for	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	the	long	term	.
so	,	that	's	one	general	 con 	 clusion 	 	about	why	 socie 	 ties 	 	make	bad	 decision 	 s 	 	:	 conflict 	 s 	 	of	interest	.
and	the	other	 general 	 ization 	 	that	i	want	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	is	that	it	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	hard	for	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	to	make	quote	-	 un 	 quote 	 	good	 decision 	 s 	 	when	there	is	a	conflict	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	held	 value 	 s 	 	that	are	good	in	 man 	 y 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	but	are	poor	in	other	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	greenland	norse	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	difficult	environment	,	 we 	 re 	 	held	together	for	four	-	and	-	a	-	half	centuries	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 share 	 d 	 	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	by	 the 	 ir 	 	strong	social	 cohes 	 ion 	 	.	but	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	strong	social	 cohes 	 ion 	 	--	 al 	 so 	 	made	it	difficult	for	them	to	change	at	the	end	and	to	learn	from	the	inuit	.	or	 to 	 day 	 	--	australia	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	enabled	australia	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	remote	 out 	 post 	 	of	european	 civil 	 ization 	 	for	250	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	british	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	a	british	 ident 	 ity 	 	is	 serv 	 ing 	 	australians	 poor 	 ly 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	need	to	adapt	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.	so	it	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	difficult	to	change	course	when	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	get	you	in	trouble	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 so 	 	the	source	of	your	strength	.
what	's	going	to	be	the	 out 	 come 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?
well	,	all	of	us	know	the	dozen	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 tick 	 ing 	 	time	 bomb 	 s 	 	going	on	in	the	modern	world	,	time	 bomb 	 s 	 	that	have	 fuse 	 s 	 	of	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	to	--	all	of	them	,	not	more	than	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	any	one	of	which	can	do	us	in	;	the	time	 bomb 	 s 	 	of	water	,	of	 s 	 oil 	 	,	of	climate	change	,	invasive	species	,	the	 photo 	 synthetic 	 	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	population	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 toxic 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	--	 list 	 ing 	 	about	12	of	them	.	and	while	these	time	 bomb 	 s 	 	--	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 ha 	 s 	 	a	fuse	beyond	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	most	of	them	have	 fuse 	 s 	 	of	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	--	some	of	them	,	in	some	 place 	 s 	 	,	have	much	 short 	 er 	 	 fuse 	 s 	 	.	at	the	rate	at	which	we	're	going	now	,	the	philippines	will	lose	all	 it 	 s 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	loggable	forest	 with 	 in 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	.	and	the	solomon	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	are	 on 	 ly 	 	one	year	away	from	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	loggable	forest	,	which	is	 the 	 ir 	 	major	export	.	and	that	's	going	to	be	spectacular	for	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	the	solomons	.	people	often	ask	me	,	jared	,	what	's	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	that	we	need	to	do	about	the	world	's	 environment 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	?
and	my	answer	is	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	we	need	to	do	is	to	forget	about	there	 be 	 ing 	 	any	single	thing	that	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	we	need	to	do	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	there	are	a	dozen	 thing 	 s 	 	,	any	one	of	which	could	do	us	in	.
and	we	've	got	to	get	them	all	right	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	solve	11	,	we	fail	to	solve	the	12th	--	we	're	in	trouble	.	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	we	solve	our	 problem 	 s 	 	of	water	and	 s 	 oil 	 	and	population	,	but	do	n't	solve	our	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 toxic 	 s 	 	,	then	we	are	in	trouble	.
the	fact	is	that	our	present	course	is	a	non	-	 sustain 	 able 	 	course	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	by	definition	,	that	it	can	not	be	 maintain 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	 out 	 come 	 	is	going	to	get	resolved	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	who	are	less	than	50	or	60	 year 	 s 	 	old	will	see	how	these	 paradox 	 es 	 	are	resolved	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	over	the	age	of	60	may	not	see	the	 re 	 solution 	 	,	but	our	children	and	 grand 	 children 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	will	.
the	 re 	 solution 	 	is	going	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	either	of	two	 form 	 s 	 	:	either	we	will	 re 	 solve 	 	these	non	-	 sustain 	 able 	 	time	-	 fuse 	 s 	 	in	 pleas 	 ant 	 	ways	of	our	own	choice	by	taking	 remedi 	 al 	 	action	,	or	else	these	 conflict 	 s 	 	are	going	to	get	 settl 	 ed 	 	in	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	ways	not	of	our	choice	--	 name 	 ly 	 	,	by	war	,	disease	or	 starv 	 ation 	 	.	but	what	's	for	 s 	 ure 	 	is	that	our	non	-	 sustain 	 able 	 	course	will	get	resolved	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	in	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	.	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	since	the	theme	of	 th 	 is 	 	session	is	 choice 	 s 	 	,	we	have	a	choice	.	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	that	we	should	get	 pessim 	 istic 	 	and	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	?	i	draw	the	reverse	 con 	 clusion 	 	.
the	big	 problem 	 s 	 	facing	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	are	not	at	all	 thing 	 s 	 	beyond	our	control	.	our	 big 	 gest 	 	threat	is	not	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	about	to	crash	 in 	 to 	 	us	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	all	the	major	 threat 	 s 	 	facing	us	 to 	 day 	 	are	 problem 	 s 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	of	our	own	making	.	and	since	we	made	the	 problem 	 s 	 	,	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	solve	the	 problem 	 s 	 	.	that	then	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 entire 	 ly 	 	in	our	power	to	deal	with	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	what	can	all	of	us	do	?	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	these	 choice 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	.	there	's	a	lot	that	we	do	n't	understand	,	and	that	we	need	to	understand	.	and	there	's	a	lot	that	we	 al 	 ready 	 	do	understand	,	but	are	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	we	need	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	.	thank	you	.
