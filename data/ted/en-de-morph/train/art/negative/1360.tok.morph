 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	are	awesome	 creature 	 s 	 	.	they	are	just	 magnific 	 ent 	 	.
they	grow	10	 meter 	 s 	 	long	.
some	say	 big 	 ger 	 	.
they	might	weigh	up	to	two	 ton 	 s 	 	.
some	say	up	to	five	 ton 	 s 	 	.
they	're	the	second	largest	fish	in	the	world	.
they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 harm 	 less 	 	plankton	-	 feed 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	they	are	thought	to	be	able	to	filter	a	cubic	kilometer	of	water	every	hour	and	can	feed	on	30	 kilo 	 s 	 	of	zoo	plankton	a	day	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
they	're	fantastic	 creature 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	in	ireland	,	we	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	and	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	them	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	coast	 commun 	 ities 	 	going	back	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	around	the	claddagh	,	duff	,	connemara	region	where	 sub 	 s 	 ist 	 ence 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	used	to	sail	out	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 hook 	 ers 	 	and	open	 boat 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	way	off	shore	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	to	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 fish 	 	bank	,	which	is	about	30	 mile 	 s 	 	west	of	achill	 is 	 land 	 	,	to	kill	the	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	old	 wood 	 cut 	 	from	the	17	,	1800s	.
so	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	oil	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	liver	.
a	third	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	liver	,	and	it	's	full	of	oil	.
you	get	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	oil	from	 the 	 ir 	 	liver	.
and	that	oil	was	used	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	 light 	 ing 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	for	 dress 	 ing 	 	 wound 	 s 	 	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	 street 	 light 	 s 	 	in	1742	of	galway	,	dublin	and	waterford	 we 	 re 	 	linked	with	 s 	 un 	 fish 	 	oil	.
and	``	 s 	 un 	 fish 	 	``	is	one	of	the	 word 	 s 	 	for	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
so	they	 we 	 re 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	around	a	long	time	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	coast	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	 document 	 ed 	 	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	 fish 	 ery 	 	in	the	world	is	that	from	achill	 is 	 land 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	keem	 ba 	 y 	 	up	in	achill	 is 	 land 	 	.
and	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	used	to	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ba 	 y 	 	.
and	the	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	would	tie	a	net	off	the	 head 	 land 	 	,	string	it	out	 a 	 long 	 	the	other	net	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 hark 	 	came	round	,	it	would	hit	the	net	,	the	net	would	collapse	on	it	.
it	would	often	drown	and	 suffoc 	 ate 	 	.
or	at	 time 	 s 	 	,	they	would	row	out	in	 the 	 ir 	 	small	 curr 	 ach 	 s 	 	and	kill	it	with	a	lance	through	the	back	of	the	neck	.
and	then	they	'd	tow	the	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	back	to	purteen	harbor	,	boil	them	up	,	use	the	oil	.
they	used	to	use	the	 fl 	 esh 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	for	 fertil 	 izer 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	would	fin	the	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	threat	to	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	--	it	is	the	 fin 	 ning 	 	of	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
we	're	often	all	 frighten 	 ed 	 	of	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 thank 	 s 	 	to	``	 jaw 	 s 	 	.	``
 may 	 be 	 	five	or	six	people	get	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	every	year	.
there	was	 some 	 one 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	was	n't	there	?	just	a	couple	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	kill	about	100	million	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	a	year	.
so	i	do	n't	know	what	the	balance	is	,	but	i	think	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	have	got	more	right	to	be	 fear 	 ful 	 	of	us	than	we	have	of	them	.
it	was	a	well	-	 document 	 ed 	 	 fish 	 ery 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	here	,	it	 peak 	 ed 	 	in	the	50s	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	1,500	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	a	year	.
and	it	 decline 	 d 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	--	a	classic	boom	and	bust	 fish 	 ery 	 	,	which	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	a	stock	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 deplete 	 d 	 	or	there	's	low	 re 	 productive 	 	rates	.
and	they	 kill 	 ed 	 	about	12,000	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	period	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	just	by	 string 	 ing 	 	a	 man 	 ila 	 	rope	off	the	tip	of	keem	 ba 	 y 	 	at	achill	 is 	 land 	 	.

the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	to	the	coast	 commun 	 ities 	 	is	 recogn 	 ized 	 	through	the	language	.
now	i	do	n't	pretend	to	have	any	irish	,	but	in	kerry	they	 we 	 re 	 	often	known	 a 	 s 	 	``	ainmhide	na	seolta	,	``	the	 mon 	 ster 	 	with	the	 sail 	 s 	 	.

hope	there	's	no	one	from	tory	here	;	 love 	 ly 	 	place	.
but	more	 common 	 ly 	 	all	around	the	 is 	 land 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 fish 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	habit	of	 bask 	 ing 	 	on	the	surface	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	out	.
there	's	great	concern	that	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	are	 deplete 	 d 	 	all	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	.
some	people	say	it	's	not	population	decline	.
it	might	be	a	change	in	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	plankton	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	would	make	fantastic	 indic 	 ators 	 	of	climate	change	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 continu 	 ous 	 	plankton	 record 	 ers 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	around	with	 the 	 ir 	 	mouth	open	.
they	're	now	 list 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	under	the	iucn	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	 move 	 s 	 	in	europe	to	try	and	stop	 catch 	 ing 	 	them	.
there	's	now	a	ban	on	 catch 	 ing 	 	them	and	even	 land 	 ing 	 	them	and	even	 land 	 ing 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	caught	 accident 	 ally 	 	.
they	're	not	 protect 	 ed 	 	in	ireland	.
in	fact	,	they	have	no	 legisl 	 ative 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	in	ireland	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	our	 import 	 ance 	 	for	the	species	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 historic 	 al 	 	 con 	 text 	 	 with 	 in 	 	which	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 re 	 side 	 	.
we	know	 ver 	 y 	 	little	about	them	.
and	most	of	what	we	do	know	is	based	on	 the 	 ir 	 	habit	of	coming	to	the	surface	.
and	we	try	to	guess	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	on	the	surface	.
i	 on 	 ly 	 	found	out	last	year	,	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	on	the	isle	of	man	,	just	how	 un 	 usual 	 	it	is	to	live	 some 	 where 	 	where	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 regular 	 ly 	 	,	 frequent 	 ly 	 	and	 predict 	 ably 	 	come	to	the	surface	to	``	bask	.	``
and	it	's	a	fantastic	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	in	science	to	see	and	experience	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	and	they	are	awesome	 creature 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	fantastic	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	them	,	to	get	access	to	them	.
so	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	--	but	last	year	was	a	big	year	--	is	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 tag 	 ging 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	so	we	could	try	to	get	some	idea	of	sight	fidelity	and	 move 	 ments 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
so	we	 concent 	 rated 	 	 main 	 ly 	 	in	north	donegal	and	west	kerry	 a 	 s 	 	the	two	 area 	 s 	 	where	i	was	 main 	 ly 	 	active	.
and	we	 tag 	 ged 	 	them	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	hi	-	tech	,	with	a	big	,	long	pole	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beach 	 cast 	 er 	 	rod	with	a	tag	on	the	end	.
go	up	in	your	boat	and	tag	the	 s 	 hark 	 	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	.
we	 tag 	 ged 	 	105	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	last	summer	.
we	got	50	in	three	 day 	 s 	 	off	inishowen	 pen 	 insula 	 	.
half	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	to	get	access	,	is	to	be	in	the	right	place	at	the	right	time	.
but	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	and	easy	 techni 	 que 	 	.
i	'll	show	you	what	they	look	like	.
we	use	a	pole	camera	on	the	boat	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	film	 s 	 hark 	 	.
one	is	to	try	and	work	out	the	gender	of	the	 s 	 hark 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 deploy 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	satellite	 tag 	 s 	 	,	so	we	did	use	hi	-	tech	stuff	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
these	are	 archiv 	 al 	 	 tag 	 s 	 	.
so	what	they	do	is	they	store	the	data	.
a	satellite	tag	 on 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	when	the	air	is	clear	of	the	water	and	can	 s 	 end 	 	a	signal	to	the	satellite	.
and	of	course	,	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	fish	,	are	 under 	 water 	 	most	of	the	time	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	tag	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	out	the	 location 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 hark 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	and	the	setting	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	plus	water	temperature	and	depth	.
and	you	have	to	kind	of	 re 	 construct 	 	the	path	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	you	set	the	tag	to	detach	from	the	 s 	 hark 	 	after	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	period	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	was	eight	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	 liter 	 ally 	 	to	the	day	the	tag	 pop 	 ped 	 	off	,	 drift 	 ed 	 	up	,	 s 	 aid 	 	 hell 	 o 	 	to	the	satellite	and	 s 	 ent 	 	,	not	all	the	data	,	but	 en 	 ough 	 	data	for	us	to	use	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	 re 	 ally 	 	work	out	the	behavior	and	the	 move 	 ments 	 	when	they	're	under	water	.
and	here	's	a	couple	of	 map 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
that	one	,	you	can	see	that	we	 tag 	 ged 	 	both	off	kerry	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	 s 	 pent 	 	all	 it 	 s 	 	time	,	the	last	eight	 month 	 s 	 	,	in	irish	 water 	 s 	 	.
christmas	day	it	was	out	on	the	shelf	edge	.
and	here	's	one	that	we	have	n't	ground	-	truthed	it	yet	with	sea	surface	temperature	and	water	depth	,	but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	second	 s 	 hark 	 	kind	of	 s 	 pent 	 	most	of	 it 	 s 	 	time	in	and	around	the	irish	sea	.
 col 	 league 	 s 	 	from	the	isle	of	man	last	year	 actual 	 ly 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	one	 s 	 hark 	 	that	went	from	the	isle	of	man	all	the	way	out	to	nova	scotia	in	about	90	 day 	 s 	 	.
that	's	nine	and	a	half	thousand	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.	we	never	thought	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 col 	 league 	 	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	about	20	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	off	massachusetts	,	and	his	 tag 	 s 	 	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	work	.
all	he	 know 	 s 	 	is	where	he	 tag 	 ged 	 	them	and	he	 know 	 s 	 	where	they	 pop 	 ped 	 	off	.
and	his	 tag 	 s 	 	 pop 	 ped 	 	off	in	the	caribbean	and	even	in	brazil	.
and	we	thought	that	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 temper 	 ate 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 on 	 ly 	 	lived	in	our	latitude	.
but	in	actual	fact	,	they	're	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	learn	about	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
one	thing	that	i	think	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	and	strange	thing	is	just	how	low	the	genetic	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	are	.
now	i	'm	not	a	 genetic 	 ist 	 	,	so	i	'm	not	going	to	pretend	to	understand	the	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	why	it	's	great	to	have	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	a	field	person	,	i	get	panic	 attack 	 s 	 	if	i	have	to	 s 	 pend 	 	too	 man 	 y 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	in	a	lab	with	a	white	coat	on	--	take	me	away	.
so	we	can	work	with	 genetic 	 ists 	 	who	understand	that	.
so	when	they	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 genetic 	 s 	 	of	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	they	found	that	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	low	.
if	you	look	at	the	first	line	 re 	 ally 	 	,	you	can	see	that	all	these	different	 s 	 hark 	 	species	are	all	 quit 	 e 	 	similar	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	that	they	're	all	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	and	they	've	come	from	a	common	 ance 	 stry 	 	.
if	you	look	at	nucleotide	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	more	 genetic 	 s 	 	that	are	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	through	 parent 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	that	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	first	 stud 	 y 	 	,	was	an	order	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	less	 divers 	 ity 	 	than	other	 s 	 hark 	 	species	.
and	you	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	work	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	2006	.
before	2006	,	we	had	no	idea	of	the	genetic	 vari 	 ability 	 	of	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
we	had	no	idea	,	did	they	distinguish	 in 	 to 	 	different	 population 	 s 	 	?
 we 	 re 	 	there	 sub 	 population 	 s 	 	?
and	of	course	,	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	if	you	want	to	know	what	the	population	 s 	 ize 	 	is	and	the	 stat 	 us 	 	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	.
so	les	noble	in	aberdeen	kind	of	found	 th 	 is 	 	a	bit	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	.
so	he	did	 an 	 other 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	using	 micro 	 satellite 	 s 	 	,	which	are	much	more	expensive	,	much	more	time	 consum 	 ing 	 	,	and	,	to	his	surprise	,	came	up	with	 al 	 most 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 do 	 es 	 	seem	to	be	that	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	for	some	reason	,	have	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	low	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
and	it	's	thought	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	a	 bottle 	 neck 	 	,	a	genetic	 bottle 	 neck 	 	thought	to	be	12,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
and	yet	,	if	you	look	at	whale	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	other	plankton	eating	large	 s 	 hark 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	is	much	 great 	 er 	 	.
so	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	make	sense	at	all	.
they	found	that	there	was	no	genetic	 different 	 iation 	 	between	any	of	the	world	's	 ocean 	 s 	 	of	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	are	found	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	,	you	could	n't	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	from	one	from	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	the	atlantic	,	new	zealand	,	or	from	ireland	,	south	africa	.
they	all	 bas 	 ically 	 	seem	the	same	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	kind	of	surprising	.	you	would	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	expect	that	.
i	do	n't	understand	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	do	n't	pretend	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	suspect	most	 genetic 	 ists 	 	do	n't	understand	it	either	,	but	they	produce	the	 number 	 s 	 	.
so	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	estimate	the	population	 s 	 ize 	 	based	on	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	the	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
and	rus	hoelzel	came	up	with	an	effective	population	 s 	 ize 	 	:	8,200	 animal 	 s 	 	.
that	's	it	.
8,000	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	that	's	just	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.	no	way	.	``
so	les	did	a	 fin 	 er 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	and	he	found	out	it	came	out	about	9,000	.
and	using	different	 micro 	 satellite 	 s 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	the	different	 result 	 s 	 	.
but	the	average	of	all	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	came	out	--	the	mean	is	about	5,000	,	which	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	,	but	then	i	am	a	skeptic	.
but	even	if	you	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	a	few	 number 	 s 	 	around	,	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	of	an	effective	population	of	about	20,000	 animal 	 s 	 	.
do	you	remember	how	 man 	 y 	 	they	 kill 	 ed 	 	off	achill	there	in	the	70s	and	the	50s	?
so	what	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	that	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	risk	of	 extinct 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	species	 be 	 cause 	 	 it 	 s 	 	population	is	so	small	.
in	fact	,	of	 t 	 hose 	 	20,000	,	8,000	 we 	 re 	 	thought	to	be	 female 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	8,000	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	 female 	 s 	 	in	the	world	?
i	do	n't	know	.	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	.
the	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	they	 we 	 re 	 	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	with	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
they	did	n't	get	 en 	 ough 	 	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	explore	the	 genetic 	 s 	 	in	 en 	 ough 	 	detail	.
so	where	do	you	get	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	from	for	your	genetic	analysis	?
well	one	obvious	source	is	dead	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	dead	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 wash 	 ed 	 	up	.
we	might	get	two	or	three	dead	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 wash 	 ed 	 	up	in	ireland	a	year	,	if	we	're	kind	of	 luck 	 y 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	source	would	be	 fish 	 eries 	 	 by 	 catch 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	caught	in	surface	drift	 net 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 bann 	 ed 	 	now	,	and	that	'll	be	good	news	for	the	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
and	some	are	caught	in	 net 	 s 	 	,	in	 trawl 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 hark 	 	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	in	howth	just	before	christmas	,	 il 	 legal 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	do	that	under	e.u	.	law	,	and	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 old 	 	for	eight	 eur 	 os 	 	a	kilo	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	steak	.
they	even	put	a	recipe	up	on	the	wall	,	 un 	 til 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	told	 th 	 is 	 	was	 il 	 legal 	 	.
and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	get	a	fine	for	that	.
so	if	you	look	at	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	the	total	number	of	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	is	86	at	present	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	work	,	and	they	can	ask	some	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	tell	us	about	population	 s 	 ize 	 	and	 sub 	 population 	 s 	 	and	structure	,	but	they	're	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	by	lack	of	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
now	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	out	 tag 	 ging 	 	our	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	 tag 	 ged 	 	them	on	the	front	of	a	rib	--	get	in	there	fast	--	 occasion 	 ally 	 	the	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	do	react	.
and	on	one	occasion	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	up	in	malin	head	up	in	donegal	,	a	 s 	 hark 	 	 s 	 mack 	 ed 	 	the	side	of	the	boat	with	his	tail	,	more	,	i	think	,	in	 start 	 le 	 	to	the	fact	that	a	boat	came	near	it	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	tag	going	in	.
and	that	was	fine	.	we	got	wet	.	no	problem	.
and	then	when	 my 	 self 	 	and	emmett	got	back	to	malin	head	,	to	the	 pi 	 er 	 	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	some	black	 s 	 lime 	 	on	the	front	of	the	boat	.
and	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	--	i	used	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	out	on	commercial	 fish 	 ing 	 	 boat 	 s 	 	--	i	remember	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	they	can	 al 	 ways 	 	tell	when	a	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	's	 be 	 en 	 	caught	in	the	net	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 leav 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	black	 s 	 lime 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	.
so	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	that	must	have	come	from	the	 s 	 hark 	 	.
now	we	had	an	interest	in	 get 	 ting 	 	tissue	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	for	 genetic 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 k 	 new 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	.
and	we	would	use	 convention 	 al 	 	 method 	 s 	 	--	i	have	a	 cross 	 bow 	 	,	you	see	the	 cross 	 bow 	 	in	my	hand	there	,	which	we	use	to	 s 	 ample 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	and	 dolphin 	 s 	 	for	genetic	 stud 	 ies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	that	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
all	it	was	 do 	 ing 	 	was	 break 	 ing 	 	my	 arrow 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 s 	 hark 	 	skin	is	just	so	strong	.
there	was	no	way	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	get	a	 s 	 ample 	 	from	that	.
so	that	was	n't	going	to	work	.
so	when	i	saw	the	black	 s 	 lime 	 	on	the	bow	of	the	boat	,	i	thought	,	``	if	you	take	what	you	're	 give 	 n 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	.	.	.	``
so	i	 scrap 	 ed 	 	it	off	.
and	i	had	a	little	tube	with	alcohol	in	it	to	 s 	 end 	 	to	the	 genetic 	 ists 	 	.
so	i	 scrap 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 lime 	 	off	and	i	 s 	 ent 	 	it	off	to	aberdeen	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	might	try	that	.	``
and	they	 s 	 at 	 	on	it	for	 month 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	a	 con 	 ference 	 	on	the	isle	of	man	.
but	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 email 	 ing 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	have	you	had	a	chance	to	look	at	my	 s 	 lime 	 	yet	?	``
and	he	was	like	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 lat 	 er 	 	.	``
 any 	 way 	 	he	thought	he	'd	better	do	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	never	met	him	before	and	he	might	lose	face	if	he	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	the	thing	i	 s 	 ent 	 	him	.
and	he	was	 amaz 	 ed 	 	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	dna	from	the	 s 	 lime 	 	.
and	they	 ampl 	 ified 	 	it	and	they	tested	it	and	they	found	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	dna	,	which	was	got	from	the	 s 	 lime 	 	.
and	so	he	was	all	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	simon	's	 s 	 hark 	 	 s 	 lime 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	know	,	i	can	build	on	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
so	we	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	're	going	to	try	to	get	out	and	get	some	 s 	 lime 	 	.
so	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	three	and	a	half	thousand	on	satellite	 tag 	 s 	 	,	i	then	thought	i	'd	invest	7.95	--	the	price	is	still	on	it	--	in	my	local	 hard 	 ware 	 	store	in	kilrush	for	a	mop	handle	and	even	less	money	on	some	oven	 clean 	 ers 	 	.
and	i	 wrap 	 ped 	 	the	oven	 clean 	 er 	 	around	the	end	of	the	mop	handle	and	was	desperate	,	desperate	to	have	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	get	some	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	was	 in 	 to 	 	august	now	,	and	 normal 	 ly 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	peak	at	june	,	july	.
and	you	 rare 	 ly 	 	see	them	.
you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	be	in	the	right	place	to	find	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	august	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	desperate	.
so	we	 rush 	 ed 	 	out	to	blasket	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	there	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	there	and	 manage 	 d 	 	to	find	some	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
so	by	just	 rub 	 bing 	 	the	mop	handle	down	the	 s 	 hark 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	swam	under	the	boat	--	you	see	,	here	's	a	 s 	 hark 	 	that	's	running	under	the	boat	here	--	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	collect	 s 	 lime 	 	.
and	here	it	is	.
look	at	that	 love 	 ly 	 	,	black	 s 	 hark 	 	 s 	 lime 	 	.
and	in	about	half	an	hour	,	we	got	five	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	five	individual	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ampl 	 ed 	 	using	simon	's	 s 	 hark 	 	 s 	 lime 	 	 s 	 ampl 	 ing 	 	system	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 whale 	 s 	 	and	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	ireland	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	and	they	're	kind	of	a	bit	more	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	saw	the	 hump 	 back 	 	whale	 foot 	 age 	 	that	we	got	there	a	month	or	two	ago	off	 count 	 y 	 	wexford	.
and	you	 al 	 ways 	 	think	you	might	have	some	 leg 	 acy 	 	you	can	 leav 	 e 	 	the	world	 be 	 hind 	 	.
and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 hump 	 back 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	 b 	 reach 	 ing 	 	and	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
but	 he 	 y 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 ent 	 	to	you	and	you	just	have	to	take	them	when	they	come	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	possibly	going	to	be	my	 leg 	 acy 	 	--	simon	's	 s 	 hark 	 	 s 	 lime 	 	.
so	we	got	more	money	 th 	 is 	 	year	to	carry	on	 collect 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
and	one	thing	that	is	kind	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	is	that	we	use	a	pole	 camera 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 col 	 league 	 	joanne	with	a	pole	camera	--	where	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	 under 	 neath 	 	the	 s 	 hark 	 	.
and	what	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	is	the	 male 	 s 	 	have	 clasp 	 ers 	 	,	which	kind	of	 d 	 angle 	 	out	 be 	 hind 	 	the	back	of	the	 s 	 hark 	 	.
so	you	can	 quit 	 e 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	tell	the	gender	of	the	 s 	 hark 	 	.
so	if	we	can	tell	the	gender	of	the	 s 	 hark 	 	before	we	 s 	 ample 	 	it	,	we	can	tell	the	 genetic 	 ist 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	taken	from	a	male	or	a	female	.
 be 	 cause 	 	at	the	moment	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	no	way	 genetic 	 ally 	 	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	male	and	a	female	,	which	i	found	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 stagger 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	know	what	 prim 	 ers 	 	to	look	for	.
and	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	tell	the	gender	of	a	 s 	 hark 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	the	trade	in	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	and	other	species	through	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 il 	 legal 	 	to	trade	any	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
and	they	are	caught	and	they	are	on	the	market	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	field	biologist	,	you	just	want	to	get	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	with	these	 animal 	 s 	 	.
you	want	to	learn	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	.
they	're	often	 quit 	 e 	 	brief	.	they	're	often	 ver 	 y 	 	 season 	 ally 	 	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	.
and	you	just	want	to	learn	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	.
but	is	n't	it	fantastic	that	you	can	then	 off 	 er 	 	these	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	other	 discipline 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 genetic 	 ists 	 	,	who	can	gain	so	much	more	from	that	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 ent 	 	to	you	in	strange	ways	.	grab	them	while	you	can	.
i	'll	take	that	 a 	 s 	 	my	scientific	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	i	might	get	 some 	 thing 	 	a	bit	more	 dramat 	 ic 	 	and	romantic	before	i	die	.
but	for	the	time	 be 	 ing 	 	,	thank	you	for	that	.
and	keep	an	eye	out	for	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	more	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	we	have	a	 bask 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	now	just	set	up	.
so	thank	you	and	thank	you	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
