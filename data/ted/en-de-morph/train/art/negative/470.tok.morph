after	ten	 year 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	the	japanese	 cap 	 s 	 	are	in	what	we	call	the	eastern	garbage	patch	,	while	 our 	 s 	 	litter	the	philippines	.
after	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	see	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	the	 deb 	 ris 	 	 accumul 	 ation 	 	zone	of	the	north	 pac 	 ific 	 	 gy 	 re 	 	.
it	so	 happen 	 s 	 	that	 million 	 s 	 	of	 al 	 batross 	 	 nest 	 ing 	 	on	kure	and	 mid 	 way 	 	 a 	 toll 	 s 	 	in	the	 north 	 west 	 	hawaiian	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	national	monument	 for 	 age 	 	here	and	scavenge	 what 	 ever 	 	they	can	find	for	 regurgit 	 ation 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 chick 	 s 	 	.

but	,	 most 	 ly 	 	bottle	 cap 	 s 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	mae	west	,	still	 al 	 ive 	 	at	a	 zoo 	 keeper 	 	's	home	in	new	orleans	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	what	my	home	town	of	long	beach	was	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	the	problem	,	so	on	 coast 	 al 	 	clean	-	up	day	in	2005	i	went	to	the	long	beach	 pen 	 insula 	 	,	at	the	east	end	of	our	long	beach	.
we	 clean 	 ed 	 	up	the	 swath 	 s 	 	of	beach	 show 	 n 	 	.

i	got	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 taker 	 s 	 	.
here	are	the	1,100	bottle	 cap 	 s 	 	they	 collect 	 ed 	 	.
i	thought	i	would	 s 	 pend 	 	20	 buck 	 s 	 	.
that	day	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	60	.
i	 separat 	 ed 	 	them	by	color	and	put	them	on	 dis 	 play 	 	the	next	earth	day	at	cabrillo	marine	 aqua 	 rium 	 	in	san	pedro	.
 govern 	 or 	 	schwarzenegger	and	his	wife	maria	 stop 	 ped 	 	by	to	discuss	the	 dis 	 play 	 	.
in	spite	of	my	``	 girl 	 y 	 	man	``	hat	,	 crochet 	 ed 	 	from	plastic	 shop 	 ping 	 	 bag 	 s 	 	,	they	 s 	 hook 	 	my	hand	.
i	 show 	 ed 	 	him	and	maria	a	 zoo 	 plankton 	 	trawl	from	the	 gy 	 re 	 	north	of	hawaii	with	more	plastic	than	plankton	.
here	's	what	our	trawl	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	from	the	plastic	soup	our	ocean	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	look	like	.
 trawl 	 ing 	 	a	 zoo 	 plankton 	 	net	on	the	surface	for	a	mile	 produce 	 s 	 	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	when	the	 deb 	 ris 	 	 wash 	 es 	 	up	on	the	 beach 	 es 	 	of	hawaii	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	beach	is	kailua	beach	,	the	beach	where	our	 p 	 resident 	 	and	his	family	 vac 	 ation 	 ed 	 	before	moving	to	washington	.
now	,	how	do	we	 analyz 	 e 	 	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	that	contain	more	plastic	than	plankton	?
we	sort	the	plastic	 fragment 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	different	 s 	 ize 	 	 class 	 es 	 	,	from	five	 millimeter 	 s 	 	to	one	-	third	of	a	millimeter	.
small	bits	of	plastic	 concent 	 rate 	 	 persist 	 ent 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 pollutant 	 s 	 	up	to	a	million	 time 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 level 	 s 	 	in	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	 sea 	 water 	 	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	if	the	most	common	fish	in	the	deep	ocean	,	at	the	base	of	the	food	chain	,	was	 ing 	 est 	 ing 	 	these	poison	 pill 	 s 	 	.
we	did	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 necro 	 psies 	 	,	and	over	a	third	had	 pollute 	 d 	 	plastic	 fragment 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 stomach 	 s 	 	.
the	record	-	holder	,	 on 	 ly 	 	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	 inch 	 es 	 	long	,	had	84	 piece 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	stomach	.
now	,	you	can	buy	 cert 	 ified 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	produce	.
but	no	 fish 	 mon 	 ger 	 	on	earth	can	sell	you	a	 cert 	 ified 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	wild	-	caught	fish	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	we	are	 leav 	 ing 	 	to	future	 generation 	 s 	 	.
the	 throw 	 away 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	can	not	be	 contain 	 ed 	 	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	global	.
we	 simpl 	 y 	 	can	not	store	and	maintain	or	 re 	 cycle 	 	all	our	stuff	.
we	have	to	throw	it	away	.
now	,	the	market	can	do	a	lot	for	us	,	but	it	ca	n't	fix	the	natural	system	in	the	ocean	we	've	broken	.
all	the	king	's	 horse 	 s 	 	and	all	the	king	's	men	...
will	never	gather	up	all	the	plastic	and	put	the	ocean	back	together	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	the	 level 	 s 	 	are	increasing	,	the	amount	of	 pack 	 aging 	 	is	increasing	,	the	``	 throw 	 away 	 	``	 con 	 cept 	 	of	living	is	 pro 	 life 	 rating 	 	,	and	it	's	 show 	 ing 	 	up	in	the	ocean	.
anchor	:	he	 off 	 ers 	 	no	hope	of	 clean 	 ing 	 	it	up	.
 s 	 training 	 	the	ocean	for	plastic	would	be	beyond	the	budget	of	any	country	and	it	might	kill	 un 	 told 	 	 amount 	 s 	 	of	sea	life	in	the	process	.
the	solution	,	moore	 say 	 s 	 	,	is	to	stop	the	plastic	at	 it 	 s 	 	source	:	stop	it	on	land	before	it	 fall 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	.
and	in	a	plastic	-	 wrap 	 ped 	 	and	 package 	 d 	 	world	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	hold	out	much	hope	for	that	,	either	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	brian	rooney	for	nightline	,	in	long	beach	,	california	.
