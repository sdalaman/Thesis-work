a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	felt	like	i	was	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	a	rut	,	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	follow	in	the	 foot 	 step 	 s 	 	of	the	great	american	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	morgan	spurlock	,	and	try	 some 	 thing 	 	new	for	30	 day 	 s 	 	.
the	idea	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	.
think	about	 some 	 thing 	 	you	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	add	to	your	life	and	try	it	for	the	next	30	 day 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	30	 day 	 s 	 	is	just	about	the	right	amount	of	time	to	add	a	new	habit	or	subtract	a	habit	--	like	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	news	--	from	your	life	.
there	's	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	while	 do 	 ing 	 	these	30	-	day	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
the	first	was	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	 month 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	by	,	 for 	 gotten 	 	,	the	time	was	much	more	 memor 	 able 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	part	of	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	i	did	to	take	a	picture	every	day	for	a	month	.
and	i	remember	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	i	was	and	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	that	day	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	more	and	 hard 	 er 	 	30	-	day	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	my	self	-	confidence	grew	.
i	went	from	desk	-	dwelling	computer	nerd	to	the	kind	of	guy	who	 bike 	 s 	 	to	work	--	for	 f 	 un 	 	.
even	last	year	,	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 hik 	 ing 	 	up	mt	.	kilimanjaro	,	the	highest	mountain	in	africa	.
i	would	never	have	 be 	 en 	 	that	 ad 	 vent 	 ur 	 ous 	 	before	i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	30	-	day	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	 some 	 thing 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	you	can	do	 any 	 thing 	 	for	30	 day 	 s 	 	.
have	you	ever	 want 	 ed 	 	to	write	a	novel	?
every	november	,	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	try	to	write	 the 	 ir 	 	own	50,000	-	word	novel	from	scratch	in	30	 day 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	all	you	have	to	do	is	write	1,667	 word 	 s 	 	a	day	for	a	month	.
so	i	did	.
by	the	way	,	the	secret	is	not	to	go	to	sleep	 un 	 til 	 	you	've	written	your	 word 	 s 	 	for	the	day	.
you	might	be	sleep	-	 depriv 	 ed 	 	,	but	you	'll	finish	your	novel	.
now	is	my	book	the	next	great	american	novel	?
no	.	i	wrote	it	in	a	month	.
it	's	awful	.
but	for	the	rest	of	my	life	,	if	i	meet	john	hodgman	at	a	ted	party	,	i	do	n't	have	to	say	,	``	i	'm	a	computer	scientist	.	``
no	,	no	,	if	i	want	to	,	i	can	say	,	``	i	'm	a	 novel 	 ist 	 	.	``
so	here	's	one	last	thing	i	'd	like	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	when	i	made	small	,	 sustain 	 able 	 	 change 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	i	could	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	stick	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	big	,	crazy	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
in	fact	,	they	're	a	ton	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
but	they	're	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	stick	.
when	i	 g 	 ave 	 	up	sugar	for	30	 day 	 s 	 	,	day	31	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	here	's	my	question	to	you	:	what	are	you	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	?
i	guarantee	you	the	next	30	 day 	 s 	 	are	going	to	pass	 whet 	 her 	 	you	like	it	or	not	,	so	why	not	think	about	 some 	 thing 	 	you	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	try	and	give	it	a	shot	for	the	next	30	 day 	 s 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
