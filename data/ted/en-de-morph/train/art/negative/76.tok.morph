i	work	with	a	species	 call 	 ed 	 	``	bonobo	.	``
and	i	'm	happy	most	of	the	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	species	on	the	planet	.
it	's	kind	of	a	well	-	 ke 	 pt 	 	secret	.
 th 	 is 	 	species	 live 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	congo	.
and	they	're	not	in	too	 man 	 y 	 	 zoo 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	sexual	behavior	.
 the 	 ir 	 	sexual	behavior	is	too	human	-	like	for	most	of	us	to	be	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	.
but	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	a	lot	to	learn	from	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	a	 ver 	 y 	 	egalitarian	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	they	're	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 em 	 pathetic 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	sexual	behavior	is	not	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	to	one	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	that	they	sort	of	set	 a 	 side 	 	.
it	 permeate 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	life	.
and	it	's	used	for	communication	.
and	it	's	used	for	conflict	 re 	 solution 	 	.
and	i	think	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 some 	 where 	 	in	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	we	sort	of	,	 divid 	 ed 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 part 	 s 	 	.
we	 divid 	 ed 	 	our	world	up	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
and	so	 every 	 thing 	 	sort	of	 ha 	 s 	 	a	place	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	fit	.
but	i	do	n't	think	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	that	way	 initi 	 ally 	 	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	people	who	think	that	the	animal	world	is	hard	-	wired	and	that	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	special	about	man	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	his	ability	to	have	 caus 	 al 	 	thought	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	special	in	his	brain	that	 allow 	 s 	 	him	to	have	language	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	special	in	his	brain	that	 allow 	 s 	 	him	to	make	 tool 	 s 	 	or	to	have	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
well	,	i	do	n't	know	.	there	 we 	 re 	 	tasmanians	who	 we 	 re 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	around	the	1600s	and	they	had	no	fire	.
they	had	no	stone	 tool 	 s 	 	.
to	our	knowledge	they	had	no	music	.
so	when	you	 compar 	 e 	 	them	to	the	bonobo	,	the	bonobo	is	a	little	hairier	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	stand	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 up 	 right 	 	.
but	there	are	a	lot	of	 similar 	 ities 	 	.
and	i	think	that	 a 	 s 	 	we	look	at	culture	,	we	kind	of	come	to	understand	how	we	got	to	where	we	are	.
and	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	it	's	in	our	biology	;	i	think	we	've	 attribut 	 ed 	 	it	to	our	biology	,	but	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	it	's	there	.
so	what	i	want	to	do	now	is	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	a	species	 call 	 ed 	 	the	bonobo	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	kanzi	.
he	's	a	bonobo	.
right	now	,	he	's	in	a	forest	in	georgia	.
his	mother	 original 	 ly 	 	came	from	a	forest	in	africa	.
and	she	came	to	us	when	she	was	just	at	puberty	,	about	six	or	seven	 year 	 s 	 	of	age	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	a	bonobo	on	your	right	,	and	a	chimpanzee	on	your	left	.
 clear 	 ly 	 	,	the	chimpanzee	 ha 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	 hard 	 er 	 	time	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	.
the	bonobo	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 short 	 er 	 	than	us	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	still	 long 	 er 	 	,	is	more	 up 	 right 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	bonobo	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	an	 australopithec 	 ine 	 	like	lucy	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	there	's	not	a	lot	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	way	a	bonobo	 walk 	 s 	 	and	the	way	an	early	 australopithec 	 ine 	 	would	have	 walk 	 ed 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	they	turn	 to 	 ward 	 	us	you	'll	see	that	the	pelvic	area	of	early	australopithecines	is	a	little	flatter	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	 rot 	 ate 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	so	much	from	side	to	side	.
so	the	--	the	bipedal	 ga 	 it 	 	is	a	little	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
and	now	we	see	all	four	.
video	:	 nar 	 rator 	 	:	the	wild	bonobo	 live 	 s 	 	in	central	africa	,	in	the	jungle	encircled	by	the	congo	river	.
canopied	 tree 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	tall	 a 	 s 	 	40	 meter 	 s 	 	,	130	feet	,	grow	 dense 	 ly 	 	in	the	area	.
it	was	a	japanese	scientist	who	first	 under 	 took 	 	serious	field	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	the	bonobo	,	 al 	 most 	 	three	 decade 	 s 	 	ago	.
 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	are	built	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	chimpanzee	.

long	and	 care 	 ful 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	 report 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	new	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	them	.
one	 discover 	 y 	 	was	that	wild	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	often	walk	bidpedally	.
what	's	more	,	they	are	able	to	walk	 up 	 right 	 	for	long	 distance 	 s 	 	.
susan	savage	-	rumbaugh	:	let	's	go	say	 hell 	 o 	 	to	austin	first	and	then	go	to	the	a	frame	.
ss	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	kanzi	and	i	,	in	the	forest	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	will	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	video	are	trained	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	them	are	 trick 	 s 	 	.
they	all	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	 capture 	 d 	 	on	film	 spontane 	 ously 	 	,	by	nhk	of	japan	.
we	have	eight	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	.

ss	:	an	entire	family	at	our	research	centre	.
video	:	you	going	to	help	get	some	 stick 	 s 	 	?
good	.
we	need	more	 stick 	 s 	 	,	too	.
i	have	a	 light 	 er 	 	in	my	pocket	if	you	need	one	.
that	's	a	 wasp 	 s 	 	'	nest	.
you	can	get	it	out	.
i	hope	i	have	a	 light 	 er 	 	.
you	can	use	the	 light 	 er 	 	to	start	the	fire	.
ss	:	so	kanzi	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	fire	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	it	yet	 with 	 out 	 	a	 light 	 er 	 	,	but	i	think	if	he	saw	 some 	 one 	 	do	it	,	he	might	be	able	to	do	--	make	a	fire	 with 	 out 	 	a	 light 	 er 	 	.
he	's	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	how	to	keep	a	fire	going	.
he	's	 learn 	 ing 	 	the	uses	for	a	fire	,	just	by	 watch 	 ing 	 	what	we	do	with	fire	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 mile 	 	on	the	face	of	a	bonobo	.
these	are	happy	vocalizations	.
video	:	you	're	happy	.
you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	about	 th 	 is 	 	part	.
you	've	got	to	put	some	water	on	the	fire	.	you	see	the	water	?
good	job	.
ss	:	 for 	 got 	 	to	zip	up	the	back	half	of	his	 back 	 pack 	 	.

ss	:	he	 talk 	 s 	 	to	other	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	at	the	lab	,	long	-	distance	,	 far 	 ther 	 	than	we	can	hear	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	his	sister	.

panbanisha	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	give	nyota	a	 hair 	 cut 	 	with	a	pair	of	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	.
in	the	wild	,	the	parent	bonobo	is	known	to	groom	 it 	 s 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	.
here	panbanisha	uses	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	her	 hand 	 s 	 	,	to	groom	nyota	.

 real 	 izing 	 	that	nyota	might	get	hurt	,	panbanisha	,	like	any	human	mother	,	 care 	 fully 	 	 tug 	 s 	 	to	get	the	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	back	.
he	can	now	cut	through	tough	animal	hide	.
ss	:	kanzi	's	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	make	stone	 tool 	 s 	 	.
video	:	kanzi	now	 make 	 s 	 	his	 tool 	 s 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	may	have	made	them	,	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	by	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	 rock 	 s 	 	in	both	 hand 	 s 	 	,	to	strike	one	against	the	other	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	by	using	both	 hand 	 s 	 	and	 aim 	 ing 	 	his	glancing	 blow 	 s 	 	,	he	can	make	much	 large 	 r 	 	,	 sharp 	 er 	 	 flake 	 s 	 	.
kanzi	 choos 	 es 	 	a	flake	he	 think 	 s 	 	is	sharp	 en 	 ough 	 	.
the	tough	hide	is	difficult	to	cut	,	even	with	a	knife	.
the	rock	that	kanzi	is	using	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	hard	and	ideal	for	stone	tool	making	,	but	difficult	to	handle	,	 requir 	 ing 	 	great	skill	.
kanzi	's	rock	is	from	gona	,	ethiopia	and	is	 ident 	 ical 	 	to	that	used	by	our	african	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
these	are	the	 rock 	 s 	 	kanzi	used	and	these	are	the	 flake 	 s 	 	he	made	.
the	flat	sharp	 edge 	 s 	 	are	like	knife	 blade 	 s 	 	.
 compar 	 e 	 	them	to	the	 tool 	 s 	 	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	used	;	they	bear	a	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 re 	 semblance 	 	to	kanzi	's	.
panbanisha	is	 long 	 ing 	 	to	go	for	a	walk	in	the	 wood 	 s 	 	.
she	 keep 	 s 	 	 star 	 ing 	 	out	the	window	.
ss	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	let	me	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	we	did	n't	think	they	would	do	.

it	's	a	 geo 	 metric 	 	language	.

 research 	 ers 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	record	what	panbanisha	 s 	 aid 	 	,	by	writing	lexigrams	on	the	floor	with	chalk	.
panbanisha	 watch 	 ed 	 	.
soon	she	 beg 	 an 	 	to	write	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	bonobo	's	abilities	have	 stunn 	 ed 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
how	did	they	develop	?
ss	:	we	found	that	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	for	permitting	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	language	is	not	to	teach	them	.
it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	use	language	around	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	force	in	language	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	is	to	understand	what	 other 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 import 	 ant 	 	to	you	,	are	 say 	 ing 	 	to	you	.
once	you	have	that	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	the	ability	to	produce	language	 come 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	and	 ra 	 ther 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	.
so	we	want	to	create	an	environment	in	which	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	,	like	all	of	the	 individual 	 s 	 	with	whom	they	are	 interact 	 ing 	 	--	we	want	to	create	an	environment	in	which	they	have	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	an	environment	in	which	the	 other 	 s 	 	are	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	for	them	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	environment	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	out	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	potential	in	kanzi	and	panbanisha	.
panbanisha	is	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	her	harmonica	,	 un 	 til 	 	nyota	,	now	one	year	old	,	 steal 	 s 	 	it	.
then	he	 peer 	 s 	 	 eager 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	mother	's	mouth	.
is	he	looking	for	where	the	sound	came	from	?
dr.	 s 	 ue 	 	 think 	 s 	 	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	allow	 s 	 uch 	 	curiosity	to	flourish	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	panbanisha	is	 play 	 ing 	 	the	electric	piano	.
she	was	n't	 force 	 d 	 	to	learn	the	piano	;	she	saw	a	 research 	 er 	 	play	the	instrument	and	took	an	interest	.

take	the	 cher 	 ries 	 	too	.
now	watch	out	,	stay	away	from	them	now	.

oh	no	!
good	kanzi	.	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.	thank	you	so	much	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	,	bonobo	or	human	,	can	possibly	even	imagine	?
ss	:	so	we	have	a	bi	-	species	environment	,	we	call	it	a	``	panhomoculture	.	``
we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	 be 	 come 	 	like	them	.
we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	communicate	with	them	,	in	 re 	 ally 	 	high	-	 pitch 	 ed 	 	 tone 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	that	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	a	language	in	the	wild	.
and	they	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	like	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	's	not	biology	;	it	's	culture	.
so	we	're	sharing	 tool 	 s 	 	and	technology	and	language	with	 an 	 other 	 	species	.
thank	you	.
