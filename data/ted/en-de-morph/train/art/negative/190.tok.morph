i	live	and	work	from	tokyo	,	japan	.
and	i	 special 	 ize 	 	in	human	 behavior 	 al 	 	research	,	and	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	what	we	learn	to	think	about	the	future	in	different	ways	,	and	to	design	for	that	future	.
and	you	know	,	to	be	honest	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	have	n't	got	a	clue	what	the	future	is	going	to	be	like	.
but	i	've	got	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	idea	how	people	will	 behav 	 e 	 	when	they	get	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 off 	 ice 	 	.	it	's	out	there	.
it	's	not	in	the	lab	,	and	it	's	 increasing 	 ly 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	india	,	 chin 	 a 	 	,	brazil	,	africa	.
we	live	on	a	planet	--	6.3	billion	people	.
about	three	billion	people	,	by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	will	have	cellular	 connect 	 ivity 	 	.
and	it	'll	take	about	 an 	 other 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	to	connect	the	next	billion	after	that	.
and	i	 ment 	 ion 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	we	want	to	design	for	that	future	,	we	need	to	figure	out	what	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	about	.
and	that	's	,	kind	of	,	where	i	see	what	my	job	is	and	what	our	team	's	job	is	.
our	research	often	 start 	 s 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	question	.
so	i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	what	do	you	carry	?
if	you	think	of	 every 	 thing 	 	in	your	life	that	you	own	,	when	you	walk	out	that	door	,	what	do	you	consider	to	take	with	you	?
when	you	're	looking	around	,	what	do	you	consider	?
of	that	stuff	,	what	do	you	carry	?
and	of	that	stuff	,	what	do	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	conscious	and	 sub 	 conscious 	 	decision	process	 im 	 plies 	 	that	the	stuff	that	you	do	take	with	you	and	end	up	using	 ha 	 s 	 	some	kind	of	spiritual	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	or	functional	value	.
and	to	put	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 blunt 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	,	people	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	pay	for	stuff	that	 ha 	 s 	 	value	,	right	?
so	i	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 d 	 one 	 	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	'	research	looking	at	what	people	carry	.
i	go	in	people	's	 bag 	 s 	 	.	i	look	in	people	's	 pocket 	 s 	 	,	 pur 	 s 	 es 	 	.
i	go	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	.	and	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	,	and	we	follow	them	around	town	with	video	 camera 	 s 	 	.
it	's	kind	of	like	 s 	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	 per 	 mission 	 	.
and	we	do	all	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	to	go	back	to	the	original	question	,	what	do	people	carry	?
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	people	carry	a	lot	of	stuff	.
ok	,	that	's	fair	 en 	 ough 	 	.
but	if	you	ask	people	what	the	three	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	carry	are	--	 a 	 cross 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 cross 	 	gender	and	 a 	 cross 	 	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	--	most	people	will	say	 key 	 s 	 	,	money	and	,	if	they	own	one	,	a	mobile	phone	.
and	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	thing	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	thing	,	right	?
i	mean	,	i	could	n't	take	your	 phone 	 s 	 	off	you	if	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	.
you	'd	 prob 	 ably 	 	kick	me	out	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
ok	,	it	might	seem	like	an	obvious	thing	for	 some 	 one 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	for	a	mobile	phone	company	to	ask	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	question	is	,	why	?	right	?
so	why	are	these	 thing 	 s 	 	so	 import 	 ant 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	?
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	from	our	research	,	that	it	 boil 	 s 	 	down	to	 surviv 	 al 	 	--	 surviv 	 al 	 	for	us	and	 surviv 	 al 	 	for	our	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 key 	 s 	 	provide	an	access	to	shelter	and	 warm 	 th 	 	--	transport	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	in	the	u.s.	 increasing 	 ly 	 	.
money	is	 use 	 ful 	 	for	 buy 	 ing 	 	food	,	 s 	 us 	 ten 	 ance 	 	,	among	all	 it 	 s 	 	other	uses	.
and	a	mobile	phone	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	is	a	great	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	tool	.
if	you	prefer	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	maslow	's	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	 need 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 object 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 support 	 ing 	 	the	 low 	 est 	 	 rung 	 s 	 	in	maslow	's	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	 need 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	they	do	a	whole	bunch	of	other	stuff	,	but	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	it	's	the	mobile	phone	's	ability	to	allow	people	to	transcend	space	and	time	.
and	what	i	mean	by	that	is	,	you	know	,	you	can	transcend	space	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	making	a	voice	call	,	right	?
and	you	can	transcend	time	by	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	at	your	convenience	,	and	 some 	 one 	 	else	can	pick	it	up	at	 the 	 ir 	 	convenience	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 fair 	 ly 	 	 universal 	 ly 	 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	which	is	why	we	have	three	billion	plus	people	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	they	value	that	 connect 	 ivity 	 	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	with	pcs	.
and	you	can	do	them	with	phone	 kiosk 	 s 	 	.
and	the	mobile	phone	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	is	both	personal	--	and	so	it	 al 	 so 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	degree	of	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	--	and	it	's	convenient	.
you	do	n't	need	to	ask	 per 	 mission 	 	from	 any 	 one 	 	,	you	can	just	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	do	it	,	right	?
 how 	 ever 	 	,	for	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	help	us	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	them	 be 	 ing 	 	carried	.
but	--	and	it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	but	--	we	forget	.
we	're	human	,	that	's	what	we	do	.	it	's	one	of	our	 feature 	 s 	 	.
i	think	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	nice	feature	.
so	we	forget	,	but	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 adapt 	 able 	 	,	and	we	adapt	to	 situ 	 ations 	 	around	us	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	.
and	so	we	have	these	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	to	remember	,	and	one	of	them	was	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	.
and	it	's	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	the	point	of	 reflect 	 ion 	 	.
and	that	's	that	moment	when	you	're	 walk 	 ing 	 	out	of	a	space	,	and	you	turn	around	,	and	 quit 	 e 	 	often	you	tap	your	 pocket 	 s 	 	.
even	women	who	keep	stuff	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 bag 	 s 	 	tap	 the 	 ir 	 	 pocket 	 s 	 	.
and	you	turn	around	,	and	you	look	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	space	,	and	some	people	talk	 a 	 loud 	 	.
and	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 one 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	at	some	point	.
ok	,	the	next	thing	is	--	most	of	you	,	if	you	have	a	 s 	 table 	 	home	life	,	and	what	i	mean	is	that	you	do	n't	travel	all	the	time	,	and	 al 	 ways 	 	in	 hotel 	 s 	 	,	but	most	people	have	what	we	call	a	center	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
and	a	center	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	is	where	you	keep	these	 object 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 thing 	 s 	 	do	n't	stay	in	the	center	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	but	over	time	,	they	 gravit 	 ate 	 	there	.
it	's	where	you	expect	to	find	stuff	.
and	in	fact	,	when	you	're	 turn 	 ing 	 	around	,	and	you	're	looking	 in 	 side 	 	the	house	,	and	you	're	looking	for	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	look	first	,	right	?
ok	,	so	when	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	research	,	we	found	the	 absolute 	 ly 	 	,	100	percent	,	 guarantee 	 d 	 	way	to	never	forget	 any 	 thing 	 	ever	,	ever	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	that	is	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	to	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	remember	.
ok	,	now	,	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	 some 	 thing 	 	you	get	on	a	chinese	fortune	cookie	,	right	?
but	is	,	in	fact	,	about	the	art	of	 deleg 	 ation 	 	.
and	from	a	design	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	it	's	about	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	you	can	 deleg 	 ate 	 	to	technology	and	what	you	can	 deleg 	 ate 	 	to	other	people	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	 deleg 	 ation 	 	--	if	you	want	it	to	be	--	can	be	the	solution	for	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 a 	 part 	 	from	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 bod 	 ily 	 	 function 	 s 	 	,	going	to	the	toilet	.
you	ca	n't	ask	 some 	 one 	 	to	do	that	on	your	 be 	 half 	 	.
and	 a 	 part 	 	from	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	you	would	n't	pay	for	 some 	 one 	 	to	go	to	the	cinema	for	you	and	have	 f 	 un 	 	on	your	 be 	 half 	 	,	or	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	not	yet	.
 may 	 be 	 	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	future	,	we	will	.
so	,	let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 deleg 	 ation 	 	in	practice	,	right	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	thing	i	'm	most	passionate	about	is	the	research	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	on	 il 	 liter 	 acy 	 	and	how	people	who	are	illiterate	communicate	.
so	,	the	u.n.	 estimate 	 d 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	2004	 figure 	 s 	 	--	that	there	are	 al 	 most 	 	800	million	people	who	ca	n't	read	and	write	,	 world 	 wide 	 	.
so	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	research	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	is	--	if	you	ca	n't	read	and	write	,	if	you	want	to	communicate	over	 distance 	 s 	 	,	you	need	to	be	able	to	identify	the	person	that	you	want	to	communicate	with	.
it	could	be	a	phone	number	,	it	could	be	an	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	address	,	it	could	be	a	 post 	 al 	 	address	.
simple	question	:	if	you	ca	n't	read	and	write	,	how	do	you	manage	your	contact	information	?
and	the	fact	is	that	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	do	it	.
just	from	a	design	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	we	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	how	they	did	it	,	and	so	that	's	just	one	small	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	kind	of	research	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	illiterate	people	are	 master 	 s 	 	of	 deleg 	 ation 	 	.
so	they	 deleg 	 ate 	 	that	part	of	the	task	process	to	other	people	,	the	stuff	that	they	ca	n't	do	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
let	me	give	you	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 deleg 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	's	a	little	bit	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	 stud 	 y 	 	that	we	did	in	uganda	about	how	people	who	are	sharing	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	use	 t 	 hose 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
sente	is	a	word	in	uganda	that	 mean 	 s 	 	money	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	second	meaning	,	which	is	to	 s 	 end 	 	money	 a 	 s 	 	 air 	 time 	 	.	ok	?
and	it	 work 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	let	's	say	,	june	,	you	're	in	a	village	,	 r 	 ural 	 	village	.
i	'm	in	kampala	and	i	'm	the	wage	 earn 	 er 	 	.
i	'm	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	money	back	,	and	it	 work 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	in	your	village	,	there	's	one	person	in	the	village	with	a	phone	,	and	that	's	the	phone	kiosk	 oper 	 ator 	 	.
and	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	that	they	'd	have	a	 quit 	 e 	 	simple	mobile	phone	 a 	 s 	 	a	phone	kiosk	.
so	what	i	do	is	,	i	buy	a	 pre 	 paid 	 	card	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	using	that	money	to	top	up	my	own	phone	,	i	call	up	the	local	village	 oper 	 ator 	 	.
and	i	read	out	that	number	to	them	,	and	they	use	it	to	top	up	 the 	 ir 	 	phone	.
so	,	they	're	 top 	 ping 	 	up	the	value	from	kampala	,	and	it	's	now	 be 	 ing 	 	 top 	 ped 	 	up	in	the	village	.
you	take	a	10	or	20	percent	commission	,	and	then	you	--	the	kiosk	 oper 	 ator 	 	 take 	 s 	 	10	or	20	percent	commission	,	and	 pass 	 es 	 	the	rest	over	to	you	in	cash	.
ok	,	there	's	two	 thing 	 s 	 	i	like	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	the	first	is	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	access	to	a	mobile	phone	--	 any 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mobile	phone	--	 essential 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	atm	machine	.
it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	 rud 	 imentary 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	 service 	 s 	 	to	 place 	 s 	 	where	there	's	no	 bank 	 ing 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
and	even	if	they	could	have	access	to	the	 bank 	 ing 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	they	would	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	 vi 	 able 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	not	 wealth 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	have	bank	 account 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	second	thing	i	like	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	that	is	that	 de 	 spite 	 	all	the	 resource 	 s 	 	at	my	 dispos 	 al 	 	,	and	 de 	 spite 	 	all	our	kind	of	 ap 	 parent 	 	 sophistic 	 ation 	 	,	i	know	i	could	never	have	designed	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	elegant	and	 a 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	in	tune	with	the	local	 condition 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	ok	?
and	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	like	grameen	bank	and	micro	-	 lend 	 ing 	 	.
but	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 th 	 is 	 	and	that	is	,	there	's	no	central	 author 	 ity 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	control	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	street	-	up	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
so	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	street	is	a	never	-	 end 	 ing 	 	source	of	inspiration	for	us	.
and	ok	,	if	you	break	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	here	,	you	return	it	to	the	 car 	 rier 	 	.
they	'll	give	you	a	new	one	.
they	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	give	you	three	new	 one 	 s 	 	,	right	?
i	mean	,	that	's	buy	three	,	get	one	free	.	that	kind	of	thing	.
if	you	go	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	,	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	they	take	the	stuff	that	 break 	 s 	 	,	and	they	fix	it	,	and	they	put	it	back	 in 	 to 	 	 circul 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	 work 	 bench 	 	in	jilin	city	,	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	and	you	can	see	people	taking	down	a	phone	and	 put 	 ting 	 	it	back	together	.
they	reverse	-	engineer	 manual 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kind	of	 hack 	 er 	 	's	manual	,	and	it	's	written	in	chinese	and	english	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	write	them	in	hindi	.
you	can	 sub 	 scribe 	 	to	these	.
there	are	training	 institute 	 s 	 	where	they	're	 churn 	 ing 	 	out	people	for	 fix 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	what	i	like	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	it	 boil 	 s 	 	down	to	 some 	 one 	 	on	the	street	with	a	small	,	flat	surface	,	a	 screw 	 driver 	 	,	a	 tooth 	 brush 	 	for	 clean 	 ing 	 	the	contact	 head 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	often	get	dust	on	the	contact	 head 	 s 	 	--	and	knowledge	.
and	it	's	all	about	the	social	network	of	the	knowledge	,	 float 	 ing 	 	around	.
and	i	like	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 challeng 	 es 	 	the	way	that	we	design	stuff	,	and	build	stuff	,	and	 potential 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 e 	 	stuff	.
it	 challeng 	 es 	 	the	 norm 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	for	me	the	street	just	 raise 	 s 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	 question 	 s 	 	.
like	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	viagra	that	i	 b 	 ought 	 	from	a	 back 	 street 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	shop	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	 chin 	 a 	 	is	a	country	where	you	get	a	lot	of	 fake 	 s 	 	.
and	i	know	what	you	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	--	did	i	test	it	?
i	'm	not	going	to	answer	that	,	ok	.
but	i	look	at	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	consider	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	trust	and	confidence	in	the	purchase	process	.
and	we	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	we	think	,	well	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	that	 app 	 ly 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	for	the	design	of	--	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	--	 app 	 ly 	 	to	the	design	of	 on 	 line 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	future	 service 	 s 	 	in	these	 market 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	pair	of	 under 	 pants 	 	from	--	--	from	tibet	.
and	i	look	at	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	,	why	would	 some 	 one 	 	design	 under 	 pants 	 	with	a	pocket	,	right	?
and	i	look	at	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	question	,	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	take	all	the	 functional 	 ity 	 	in	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 re 	 distribut 	 e 	 	them	around	the	body	in	some	kind	of	personal	area	network	,	how	would	we	 priori 	 tize 	 	where	to	put	stuff	?
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	trivial	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	can	 app 	 ly 	 	to	that	kind	of	personal	area	 network 	 s 	 	.
and	what	you	see	here	is	a	couple	of	phone	 number 	 s 	 	written	above	the	 s 	 hack 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	uganda	.
 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	house	 number 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	phone	 number 	 s 	 	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	when	people	's	 ident 	 ity 	 	is	mobile	?
when	 t 	 hose 	 	extra	three	billion	people	's	 ident 	 ity 	 	is	mobile	,	it	is	n't	 fix 	 ed 	 	?
your	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 ident 	 ity 	 	is	out	-	of	-	date	 al 	 ready 	 	,	ok	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	extra	three	billion	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	's	shifting	.
and	then	i	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	picture	here	,	which	is	the	one	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	delhi	.
it	's	from	a	 stud 	 y 	 	we	did	 in 	 to 	 	 il 	 liter 	 acy 	 	,	and	it	's	a	guy	in	a	 tea 	 shop 	 	.
you	can	see	the	chai	 be 	 ing 	 	 pour 	 ed 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
and	he	's	a	,	you	know	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	poor	 tea 	 shop 	 	 work 	 er 	 	,	on	the	 low 	 est 	 	 rung 	 s 	 	in	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	he	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	the	 value 	 s 	 	of	livestrong	.
and	it	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	the	same	 value 	 s 	 	,	but	some	kind	of	 value 	 s 	 	of	livestrong	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	out	and	purchase	them	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	them	.
for	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 person 	 ifies 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	world	,	where	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 intertwine 	 d 	 	,	and	the	 dot 	 s 	 	are	--	it	's	all	about	the	 dot 	 s 	 	 join 	 ing 	 	together	.
ok	,	the	title	of	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	is	``	 connect 	 ions 	 	and	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	,	``	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	kind	of	 summ 	 ary 	 	of	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	it	's	going	to	be	like	when	 every 	 one 	 	on	the	planet	 ha 	 s 	 	the	ability	to	transcend	space	and	time	in	a	personal	and	convenient	manner	,	right	?
when	 every 	 one 	 	's	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	there	are	four	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	first	thing	is	the	 immedi 	 acy 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	the	speed	at	which	 idea 	 s 	 	go	around	.
and	i	know	ted	is	about	big	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 bench 	 mark 	 	for	a	big	idea	is	changing	.
if	you	want	a	big	idea	,	you	need	to	embrace	 every 	 one 	 	on	the	planet	,	that	's	the	first	thing	.
the	second	thing	is	the	 immedi 	 acy 	 	of	 object 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	mean	by	that	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	these	 be 	 come 	 	 small 	 er 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 functional 	 ity 	 	that	you	can	access	through	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 bank 	 ing 	 	,	 ident 	 ity 	 	--	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	move	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	around	the	world	.
and	so	the	speed	of	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	is	just	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	that	much	more	rapid	,	in	a	way	that	we	just	 total 	 ly 	 	can	not	 conceiv 	 e 	 	,	when	you	get	it	to	6.3	billion	and	the	growth	in	the	world	's	population	.
the	next	thing	is	that	,	 how 	 ever 	 	we	design	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	--	 care 	 fully 	 	design	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	--	the	street	will	take	it	,	and	will	figure	out	ways	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	 meet 	 s 	 	base	 need 	 s 	 	--	the	ability	to	transcend	space	and	time	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
and	it	will	 innov 	 ate 	 	in	ways	that	we	can	not	 anticip 	 ate 	 	.
in	ways	that	,	 de 	 spite 	 	our	 resource 	 s 	 	,	they	can	do	it	better	than	us	.
that	's	my	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	we	're	smart	,	we	'll	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	that	's	going	on	,	and	we	'll	figure	out	a	way	to	 en 	 able 	 	it	to	inform	and	 in 	 fuse 	 	both	what	we	design	and	how	we	design	.
and	the	last	thing	is	that	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	direction	of	the	conversation	.
with	 an 	 other 	 	three	billion	people	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	they	want	to	be	part	of	the	conversation	.
and	i	think	our	relevance	and	ted	's	relevance	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 em 	 bracing 	 	that	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	listen	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	.
and	we	need	to	learn	how	to	listen	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
