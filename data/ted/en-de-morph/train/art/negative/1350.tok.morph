what	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	some	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	the	 militar 	 y 	 	of	the	western	world	--	australia	,	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	u.k.	and	so	on	--	face	in	some	of	the	 deploy 	 ments 	 	that	they	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	in	the	modern	world	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
if	you	think	about	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 s 	 ent 	 	australian	 militar 	 y 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	to	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	got	obvious	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	afghanistan	,	but	you	've	 al 	 so 	 	got	 thing 	 s 	 	like	east	timor	and	the	solomon	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
and	a	lot	of	these	 deploy 	 ments 	 	that	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	to	these	 day 	 s 	 	are	n't	 tradition 	 al 	 	 war 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	a	lot	of	the	 job 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	 militar 	 y 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	to	do	in	these	 situ 	 ations 	 	are	 one 	 s 	 	that	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 count 	 ries 	 	,	in	australia	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	so	on	,	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 d 	 one 	 	by	police	 officer 	 s 	 	.
and	so	there	's	a	bunch	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	come	up	for	 militar 	 y 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	in	these	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	trained	for	,	and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 count 	 ries 	 	are	trained	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	for	and	 equi 	 pped 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	for	.
now	there	's	a	bunch	of	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 s 	 end 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	police	to	do	these	 job 	 s 	 	.
if	australia	had	to	 s 	 end 	 	a	thousand	people	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	to	west	papua	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	do	n't	have	a	thousand	police	 officer 	 s 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	around	that	could	just	go	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	and	we	do	have	a	thousand	 soldier 	 s 	 	that	could	go	.
so	when	we	have	to	 s 	 end 	 	 some 	 one 	 	,	we	 s 	 end 	 	the	 militar 	 y 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	there	,	they	're	 avail 	 able 	 	and	,	heck	,	they	're	used	to	going	off	and	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	and	living	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	extra	support	.
so	they	are	able	to	do	it	in	that	sense	.
but	they	are	n't	trained	in	the	same	way	that	police	 officer 	 s 	 	are	and	they	're	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	 equi 	 pped 	 	in	the	same	way	police	 officer 	 s 	 	are	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	raised	a	bunch	of	 problem 	 s 	 	for	them	when	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 issue 	 s 	 	.
one	 part 	 icular 	 	thing	that	's	come	up	that	i	am	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	the	question	of	 whet 	 her 	 	,	when	we	're	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	to	do	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	,	we	ought	to	be	equipping	them	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	ought	to	be	giving	them	access	to	some	of	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	that	police	have	.
since	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	some	of	these	same	 job 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	should	have	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	there	's	a	range	of	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	'd	think	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	you	've	got	 militar 	 y 	 	checkpoints	.
if	people	are	 approach 	 ing 	 	these	checkpoints	and	the	 militar 	 y 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	there	are	 un 	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	person	's	 hostil 	 e 	 	or	not	.
say	 th 	 is 	 	person	 approach 	 ing 	 	here	,	and	they	say	,	``	well	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	 su 	 icide 	 	 bomb 	 er 	 	or	not	?
have	they	got	 some 	 thing 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	under	 the 	 ir 	 	 cloth 	 ing 	 	?	what	's	going	to	happen	?	``
they	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	person	's	 hostil 	 e 	 	or	not	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	person	 do 	 es 	 	n't	follow	 direction 	 s 	 	,	then	they	may	end	up	 shoot 	 ing 	 	them	and	then	find	out	 after 	 ward 	 	either	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	shot	the	right	person	,	or	,	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	just	an	 innoc 	 ent 	 	person	who	did	n't	understand	what	was	going	on	.
so	if	they	had	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	then	they	would	say	,	``	well	we	can	use	them	in	that	sort	of	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
if	we	shoot	 some 	 one 	 	who	was	n't	 hostil 	 e 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	we	have	n't	 kill 	 ed 	 	them	.	``
 an 	 other 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	photo	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	one	of	the	 mission 	 s 	 	in	the	balkans	in	the	late	1990s	.
 situ 	 ation 	 	's	a	little	bit	different	where	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	they	know	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	 hostil 	 e 	 	,	where	they	've	got	 some 	 one 	 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	at	them	or	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	,	 throw 	 ing 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
but	if	they	respond	,	there	's	a	range	of	other	people	around	,	who	are	 innoc 	 ent 	 	people	who	might	 al 	 so 	 	get	hurt	--	be	 col 	 lateral 	 	damage	that	the	 militar 	 y 	 	often	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	to	talk	about	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	would	say	,	``	well	if	we	have	access	to	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	if	we	've	got	 some 	 one 	 	we	know	is	 hostil 	 e 	 	,	we	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	to	deal	with	them	and	know	that	if	we	hit	 any 	 one 	 	else	around	the	place	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	're	not	going	to	kill	them	.	``
 an 	 other 	 	 suggest 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	since	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	in	the	field	,	we	can	see	the	time	coming	where	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	out	in	the	field	that	are	autonomous	.
they	're	going	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 decision 	 s 	 	about	who	to	shoot	and	who	not	to	shoot	 with 	 out 	 	a	human	in	the	loop	.
and	so	the	 suggest 	 ion 	 	is	,	well	 he 	 y 	 	,	if	we	're	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	out	and	allow	them	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	would	be	a	good	idea	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	with	these	 thing 	 s 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	so	that	if	the	robot	 make 	 s 	 	a	bad	decision	and	 shoot 	 s 	 	the	wrong	person	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	have	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	them	.
now	there	's	a	whole	range	of	different	 sort 	 s 	 	of	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	some	of	which	are	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	now	,	some	of	which	they	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	.
so	you	've	got	 tradition 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	pepper	spray	,	o.c	.	spray	up	at	the	top	there	,	or	tasers	over	here	.
the	one	on	the	top	right	here	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 dazzl 	 ing 	 	laser	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	just	blind	the	person	 moment 	 arily 	 	and	disorient	them	.
you	've	got	non	-	lethal	 shot 	 gun 	 	 round 	 s 	 	that	contain	rubber	 pel 	 lets 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	metal	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	in	the	middle	here	,	the	large	truck	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	active	 deni 	 al 	 	system	--	 some 	 thing 	 	the	u.s.	 militar 	 y 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	on	at	the	moment	.
it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	big	 micro 	 wave 	 	 transmit 	 ter 	 	.
it	's	sort	of	your	classic	idea	of	a	heat	ray	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	out	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	distance	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	any	of	these	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 any 	 body 	 	who	is	hit	with	 th 	 is 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sudden	burst	of	heat	and	just	 want 	 s 	 	to	get	out	of	the	way	.
it	is	a	lot	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	than	a	 micro 	 wave 	 	oven	,	but	it	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 boil 	 ing 	 	the	water	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	surface	level	of	your	skin	.
so	you	feel	 th 	 is 	 	massive	heat	,	and	you	go	,	``	i	want	to	get	out	of	the	way	.	``
and	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	well	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	where	we	need	to	clear	a	crowd	out	of	a	 part 	 icular 	 	area	,	if	the	crowd	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	.
if	we	need	to	keep	people	away	from	a	 part 	 icular 	 	place	,	we	can	do	that	with	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	 obvious 	 ly 	 	there	's	a	whole	range	of	different	 sort 	 s 	 	of	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	we	could	give	 militar 	 y 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	and	there	's	a	whole	range	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	they	're	looking	a	them	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	could	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.	``
but	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	 militar 	 y 	 	and	the	police	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	you	do	n't	have	to	look	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	at	 th 	 is 	 	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	fact	that	they	might	be	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	attitude	to	the	use	of	force	and	the	way	they	're	trained	to	use	force	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	different	.
the	police	--	and	 know 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	to	train	police	--	police	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	western	 jurisdiction 	 s 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	are	trained	to	de	-	 escal 	 ate 	 	force	,	to	try	and	avoid	using	force	 where 	 ver 	 	possible	,	and	to	use	lethal	force	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	absolute	last	resort	.
 militar 	 y 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	trained	for	war	,	so	they	're	trained	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	go	bad	,	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 respons 	 e 	 	is	lethal	force	.
the	moment	the	 fec 	 al 	 	matter	 hit 	 s 	 	the	 rot 	 ating 	 	turbine	,	you	can	start	 shoot 	 ing 	 	at	people	.
so	 the 	 ir 	 	 attitude 	 s 	 	to	the	use	of	lethal	force	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	and	i	think	it	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	obvious	that	 the 	 ir 	 	attitude	to	the	use	of	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	would	 al 	 so 	 	be	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	what	it	is	with	the	police	.
and	since	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	had	so	 man 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	with	police	use	of	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	ways	,	i	thought	it	would	be	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	idea	to	look	at	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	try	to	 re 	 late 	 	it	to	the	 militar 	 y 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
and	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	see	that	,	in	fact	,	even	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 advoc 	 ating 	 	the	use	of	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	by	the	 militar 	 y 	 	had	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	that	.
they	 general 	 ly 	 	seem	to	think	,	``	well	,	why	would	we	care	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	the	police	?
we	're	looking	at	 some 	 thing 	 	different	,	``	and	did	n't	seem	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	,	in	fact	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	same	stuff	.
so	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	investigate	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	and	have	a	look	at	the	way	that	police	use	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	when	they	're	 introduc 	 ed 	 	and	some	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	might	arise	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	when	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 introduc 	 e 	 	them	.
and	of	course	,	 be 	 ing 	 	australian	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	stuff	in	australia	,	 know 	 ing 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	from	my	own	experience	about	 vari 	 ous 	 	 time 	 s 	 	when	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	in	australia	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	was	the	use	of	o.c	.	spray	,	oleoresin	capsicum	spray	,	pepper	spray	,	by	australian	police	and	 see 	 ing 	 	when	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	,	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	one	 stud 	 y 	 	that	i	found	,	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	one	,	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	queensland	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	a	trial	period	for	the	use	of	pepper	spray	before	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	it	more	 broad 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	went	and	had	a	look	at	some	of	the	 figure 	 s 	 	here	.
now	when	they	 introduc 	 ed 	 	o.c	.	spray	in	queensland	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 	.
the	police	 mini 	 ster 	 	had	a	whole	heap	of	public	 state 	 ments 	 	made	about	it	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	give	police	an	option	between	 shout 	 ing 	 	and	 shoot 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	they	can	use	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	firearm	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	they	would	have	 previous 	 ly 	 	had	to	shoot	 some 	 one 	 	.	``
so	i	went	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	all	of	these	police	 shoot 	 ing 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	.
and	you	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	find	them	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	for	individual	australian	 state 	 s 	 	.
i	could	 on 	 ly 	 	find	these	 one 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	australian	institute	of	criminology	report	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	from	the	fine	print	,	if	you	can	read	it	at	the	top	:	``	police	 shoot 	 ing 	 	 death 	 s 	 	``	 mean 	 s 	 	not	just	people	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	shot	by	police	,	but	people	who	have	shot	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	presence	of	police	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 figure 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	country	.
and	the	red	arrow	 represent 	 s 	 	the	point	where	queensland	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	're	going	to	give	all	police	 officer 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	state	access	to	o.c	.	spray	.	``
so	you	can	see	there	 we 	 re 	 	six	 death 	 s 	 	sort	of	 lead 	 ing 	 	up	to	it	every	year	for	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
there	was	a	spike	,	of	course	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	before	,	but	that	was	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	queensland	.
 any 	 one 	 	know	where	that	was	?	was	n't	port	arthur	,	no	.
victoria	?	 y 	 es 	 	,	correct	.
that	spike	was	all	victoria	.
so	it	was	n't	that	queensland	had	a	 part 	 icular 	 	problem	with	 death 	 s 	 	from	police	 shoot 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
so	six	 shoot 	 ing 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	whole	country	,	 fair 	 ly 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	before	.
so	the	next	two	 year 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 year 	 s 	 	they	 stud 	 ied 	 	--	2001	,	2002	.
 any 	 one 	 	want	to	take	a	stab	at	the	number	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	how	they	've	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	number	of	 time 	 s 	 	police	in	queensland	used	o.c	.	spray	in	that	period	?
 hundred 	 s 	 	?	one	,	three	.
thousand	is	 get 	 ting 	 	better	.
 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 alter 	 native 	 	to	the	use	of	lethal	force	--	an	 alter 	 native 	 	between	 shout 	 ing 	 	and	 shoot 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	go	out	on	a	limb	here	and	say	that	if	queensland	police	did	n't	have	o.c	.	spray	,	they	would	n't	have	shot	2,226	people	in	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	if	you	have	a	look	at	the	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	,	the	material	they	 we 	 re 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	and	 exa 	 min 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	see	the	 suspect 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 arm 	 ed 	 	in	about	15	percent	of	 case 	 s 	 	where	o.c	.	spray	was	used	.
it	was	 routine 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	in	 th 	 is 	 	period	,	and	,	of	course	,	still	is	 routine 	 ly 	 	used	--	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 complain 	 ts 	 	about	it	,	not	 with 	 in 	 	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 any 	 way 	 	--	it	was	 routine 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	deal	with	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	violent	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 potential 	 ly 	 	violent	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 frequent 	 ly 	 	used	to	deal	with	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 pass 	 ively 	 	non	-	 com 	 pli 	 ant 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	person	is	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	violent	,	but	they	just	wo	n't	do	what	we	want	them	to	.
they	're	not	 obey 	 ing 	 	the	 direction 	 s 	 	that	we	're	giving	them	,	so	we	'll	give	them	a	shot	of	the	o.c	.	spray	.
that	'll	speed	them	up	.	 every 	 thing 	 	will	work	out	better	that	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	be	an	 alter 	 native 	 	to	firearms	,	but	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 routine 	 ly 	 	used	to	deal	with	a	whole	range	of	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
now	one	of	the	 part 	 icular 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	 militar 	 y 	 	use	of	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	--	and	people	when	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	 he 	 y 	 	,	there	might	be	some	 problem 	 s 	 	``	--	there	's	a	couple	of	 part 	 icular 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	get	focused	on	.
one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	is	that	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	may	be	used	 in 	 discriminate 	 ly 	 	.
one	of	the	fundamental	 principle 	 s 	 	of	 militar 	 y 	 	use	of	force	is	that	you	have	to	be	discriminate	.
you	have	to	be	 care 	 ful 	 	about	who	you	're	 shoot 	 ing 	 	at	.
so	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 suggest 	 ed 	 	with	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	is	that	they	might	be	used	 in 	 discriminate 	 ly 	 	--	that	you	use	them	against	a	whole	range	of	people	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	have	to	worry	so	much	 any 	 more 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	one	 part 	 icular 	 	 in 	 stance 	 	where	i	think	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	where	you	can	look	at	it	was	the	dubrovka	theatre	siege	in	moscow	in	2002	,	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	lot	of	you	,	 un 	 like 	 	most	of	my	 student 	 s 	 	at	adfa	,	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	old	 en 	 ough 	 	to	remember	.
so	chechens	had	come	in	and	taken	control	of	the	theater	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	700	people	 host 	 age 	 	.
they	'd	released	a	bunch	of	people	,	but	they	still	had	about	700	people	 host 	 age 	 	.
and	the	russian	special	 militar 	 y 	 	police	,	special	 force 	 s 	 	,	spetsnaz	,	came	in	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	stormed	the	theater	.
and	the	way	they	did	it	was	to	pump	the	whole	thing	full	of	 anesthet 	 ic 	 	gas	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	 lot 	 s 	 	of	these	hostages	 actual 	 ly 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	inhaling	the	gas	.
it	was	used	 in 	 discriminate 	 ly 	 	.
they	 pump 	 ed 	 	the	whole	theater	full	of	the	gas	.
and	it	's	no	surprise	that	people	 di 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	know	how	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	gas	each	person	is	going	to	 inhal 	 e 	 	,	what	position	they	're	going	to	fall	in	when	they	 be 	 come 	 	 un 	 conscious 	 	and	so	on	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	,	in	fact	,	 on 	 ly 	 	a	couple	of	people	who	got	shot	in	 th 	 is 	 	episode	.
so	when	they	had	a	look	at	it	 after 	 ward 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	couple	of	people	who	'd	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	shot	by	the	 host 	 age 	 	 taker 	 s 	 	or	shot	by	the	police	 force 	 s 	 	coming	in	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	deal	with	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
 virtual 	 ly 	 	 every 	 body 	 	that	got	 kill 	 ed 	 	got	 kill 	 ed 	 	from	inhaling	the	gas	.
the	final	toll	of	hostages	is	a	little	 un 	 clear 	 	,	but	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	a	few	more	than	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	other	people	who	 di 	 ed 	 	over	the	next	few	 day 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	one	 part 	 icular 	 	problem	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	that	it	might	be	used	 in 	 discriminate 	 ly 	 	.
second	problem	that	people	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	talk	about	with	 militar 	 y 	 	use	of	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	reason	why	in	the	chemical	 weapon 	 s 	 	convention	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	that	you	ca	n't	use	riot	control	 agent 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	weapon	of	 war 	 fare 	 	,	the	problem	with	that	is	that	it	's	 s 	 een 	 	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	used	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	an	 alter 	 native 	 	to	lethal	force	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	lethal	force	multiplier	--	that	you	use	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	first	so	that	your	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	more	effective	.
the	people	you	're	going	to	be	 shoot 	 ing 	 	at	are	n't	going	to	be	able	to	get	out	of	the	way	.
they	're	not	going	to	be	aware	of	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	and	you	can	kill	them	better	.
and	in	fact	,	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	.
the	 host 	 age 	 	 taker 	 s 	 	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 render 	 ed 	 	 un 	 conscious 	 	by	the	gas	 we 	 re 	 	not	taken	 in 	 to 	 	 cus 	 to 	 dy 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	shot	in	the	head	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	non	-	lethal	weapon	was	 be 	 ing 	 	used	,	in	fact	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	 a 	 s 	 	a	lethal	force	multiplier	to	make	 kill 	 ing 	 	more	effective	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	problem	that	i	just	want	to	 quick 	 ly 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 	is	that	there	's	a	whole	heap	of	 problem 	 s 	 	with	the	way	that	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	taught	to	use	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	and	get	trained	about	them	and	then	get	tested	and	so	on	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	get	tested	in	nice	,	safe	 environment 	 s 	 	.
and	people	get	taught	to	use	them	in	nice	,	safe	 environment 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	you	can	see	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	going	on	.
the	person	who	's	 spray 	 ing 	 	the	o.c	.	spray	is	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	rubber	glove	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	they	do	n't	get	 contami 	 nated 	 	and	so	on	.
but	they	do	n't	ever	get	used	like	that	.
they	get	used	out	in	the	real	world	,	like	in	texas	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	confess	,	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	case	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	that	 p 	 ique 	 d 	 	my	interest	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 happen 	 ed 	 	while	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	research	fellow	at	the	u.s.	 nav 	 al 	 	academy	.
and	news	 report 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	coming	up	about	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	woman	was	 argu 	 ing 	 	with	the	police	officer	.
she	was	n't	violent	.
in	fact	,	he	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	six	 inch 	 es 	 	 tall 	 er 	 	than	me	,	and	she	was	about	 th 	 is 	 	tall	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	she	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	``	well	i	'm	going	to	get	back	in	my	car	.	``
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	if	you	get	back	 in 	 to 	 	your	car	,	i	'm	going	to	tase	you	.	``
and	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	,	go	 a 	 head 	 	.	tase	me	.	``	and	so	he	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	it	's	all	 capture 	 d 	 	by	the	video	camera	running	in	the	front	of	the	police	car	.
so	she	's	72	,	and	it	's	 s 	 een 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	appropriate	way	of	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	her	.
and	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	same	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	with	other	people	where	you	think	where	you	think	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	an	appropriate	way	to	use	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	?	``
``	police	chief	 fire 	 s 	 	taser	 in 	 to 	 	14	year	-	old	girl	's	head	.	``
``	she	was	running	away	.	what	else	was	i	suppose	to	do	?	``
or	florida	:	``	police	taser	six	year	-	old	boy	at	 element 	 ary 	 	school	.	``
and	they	 clear 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	from	it	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	same	 di 	 strict 	 	,	``	police	review	policy	after	children	 shock 	 ed 	 	:	2nd	child	 shock 	 ed 	 	by	taser	stun	gun	 with 	 in 	 	 week 	 s 	 	.	``
same	police	 di 	 strict 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	child	 with 	 in 	 	 week 	 s 	 	of	tasering	the	six	year	-	old	boy	.
just	in	case	you	think	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	happen	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	canada	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	a	 col 	 league 	 	of	mine	 s 	 ent 	 	me	 th 	 is 	 	one	from	london	.
but	my	personal	 favor 	 ite 	 	of	these	 one 	 s 	 	,	i	have	to	confess	,	 do 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	:	``	 officer 	 s 	 	taser	86	year	-	old	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	woman	in	her	bed	.	``
i	 check 	 ed 	 	the	 report 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	.	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	.
 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	she	took	up	a	more	 threaten 	 ing 	 	position	in	her	bed	.
i	kid	you	not	.	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	it	 s 	 aid 	 	.
``	she	took	up	a	more	 threaten 	 ing 	 	position	in	her	bed	.	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
but	i	'd	 re 	 mind 	 	you	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 militar 	 y 	 	uses	of	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
so	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	relevant	?
 be 	 cause 	 	police	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 re 	 s 	 trained 	 	in	the	use	of	force	than	the	 militar 	 y 	 	are	.
they	're	trained	to	be	more	 re 	 s 	 trained 	 	in	the	use	of	force	than	the	 militar 	 y 	 	are	.
they	're	trained	to	think	more	,	to	try	and	de	-	 escal 	 ate 	 	.
so	if	you	have	these	 problem 	 s 	 	with	police	 officer 	 s 	 	with	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	what	on	earth	would	make	you	think	it	's	going	to	be	better	with	 militar 	 y 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	?
the	last	thing	that	i	would	just	like	to	say	,	when	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	police	about	what	a	perfect	non	-	lethal	weapon	would	look	like	,	they	 al 	 most 	 	 inevit 	 ably 	 	say	the	same	thing	.
they	say	,	``	well	,	it	's	got	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	nasty	 en 	 ough 	 	that	people	do	n't	want	to	be	hit	with	 th 	 is 	 	weapon	.
so	if	you	threaten	to	use	it	,	people	are	going	to	 com 	 ply 	 	with	it	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	any	 last 	 ing 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	.	``
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	your	perfect	non	-	lethal	weapon	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	perfect	for	abuse	.
what	would	these	 guy 	 s 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	if	they	'd	had	access	to	tasers	or	to	a	 mann 	 ed 	 	,	 port 	 able 	 	version	of	the	active	 deni 	 al 	 	system	--	a	small	heat	ray	that	you	can	use	on	people	and	not	worry	about	it	.
so	i	think	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	there	may	be	ways	that	non	-	lethal	 weapon 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	great	in	these	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	whole	heap	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	need	to	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
