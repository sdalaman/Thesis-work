charles	and	ray	 we 	 re 	 	a	team	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	husband	and	wife	.
 de 	 spite 	 	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	'	and	 van 	 ity 	 	fair	's	best	 effort 	 s 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	not	 brother 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
you	know	,	ray	was	the	one	who	 wo 	 re 	 	the	 am 	 per 	 sand 	 s 	 	in	the	family	.
we	are	going	to	focus	on	charles	 to 	 day 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	charles	'	100th	 birth 	 day 	 	.
but	when	i	speak	of	him	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	both	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	a	team	.
here	's	charles	when	he	was	three	.	so	he	would	be	100	 th 	 is 	 	june	.
we	have	a	lot	of	cool	 celebr 	 ations 	 	that	we	're	going	to	do	.
the	thing	about	 the 	 ir 	 	work	is	that	most	people	come	to	the	door	of	furniture	--	i	suspect	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	chair	and	some	of	the	 other 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	you	.
but	we	're	going	to	first	enter	through	the	door	of	the	big	top	.
the	whole	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	that	,	you	know	,	why	am	i	 show 	 ing 	 	it	?
is	it	 be 	 cause 	 	charles	and	ray	made	 th 	 is 	 	film	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	training	film	for	a	clown	college	that	they	had	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	 practice 	 d 	 	a	clown	act	when	the	future	of	furniture	was	not	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	auspicious	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	.
there	is	a	picture	of	charles	.	so	let	's	watch	the	next	clip	.
the	film	that	we	're	about	to	see	is	a	film	they	made	for	the	moscow	world	's	fair	.
video	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	land	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 contrast 	 s 	 	.
it	is	rough	and	it	is	flat	.
in	 place 	 s 	 	it	is	cold	.
in	some	it	is	hot	.
too	much	rain	 fall 	 s 	 	on	some	 area 	 s 	 	,	and	not	 en 	 ough 	 	on	 other 	 s 	 	.
but	people	live	on	 th 	 is 	 	land	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	russia	,	they	are	drawn	together	 in 	 to 	 	 town 	 s 	 	and	cities	.
here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	of	the	way	they	live	.
eames	demetrios	:	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	film	that	was	 hard 	 ly 	 	ever	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
it	was	on	seven	 screen 	 s 	 	and	it	was	200	feet	 a 	 cross 	 	.
and	it	was	at	the	height	of	the	cold	war	.
the	nixon	-	khrushchev	kitchen	debate	 happen 	 ed 	 	about	50	feet	from	where	 th 	 is 	 	was	 show 	 n 	 	.
and	yet	,	how	did	it	start	?
you	know	,	 common 	 ality 	 	,	the	first	line	in	charles	'	 nar 	 ration 	 	was	,	``	the	same	 star 	 s 	 	that	shine	down	on	russia	shine	down	on	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.	from	the	sky	,	our	cities	look	much	the	same	.	``
it	was	that	human	 connect 	 ion 	 	that	charles	and	ray	 al 	 ways 	 	found	in	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	you	can	imagine	,	and	the	thing	about	it	is	,	that	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	the	human	mind	could	handle	 th 	 is 	 	number	of	 image 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	was	to	get	the	 gest 	 alt 	 	of	what	the	 image 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	about	.
so	that	was	just	a	little	snip	.
but	the	thing	about	charles	and	ray	is	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 model 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	out	.
i	think	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	am	passionate	about	,	my	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	work	,	i	'm	passionate	about	my	work	,	but	on	top	of	all	that	i	'm	passionate	about	a	 hol 	 istic 	 	vision	of	design	,	where	design	is	a	life	skill	,	not	a	professional	skill	.
and	you	know	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	with	 kid 	 s 	 	often	want	our	 kid 	 s 	 	to	take	music	.
i	'm	no	exception	.
but	it	's	not	about	them	 be 	 coming 	 	bono	or	tracy	chapman	.
it	's	about	 get 	 ting 	 	that	music	thing	going	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
design	is	the	same	way	.	design	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	that	same	way	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	model	that	they	did	of	that	seven	-	screen	 present 	 ation 	 	.
and	charles	just	 check 	 ing 	 	it	out	there	.
so	now	we	're	going	to	go	through	that	door	of	furniture	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 un 	 usual 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	of	 air 	 port 	 	 s 	 eating 	 	.
so	what	we	're	going	to	see	is	some	of	the	 icon 	 s 	 	of	eames	furniture	.
and	the	thing	about	 the 	 ir 	 	furniture	is	that	they	 s 	 aid 	 	the	role	of	the	 design 	 er 	 	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	that	of	a	good	host	,	 anticip 	 ating 	 	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	the	guest	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	cool	 image 	 s 	 	.	but	these	are	 one 	 s 	 	i	think	are	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
these	are	all	the	 prototype 	 s 	 	.	these	are	the	 mistak 	 es 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	do	n't	think	 mistak 	 es 	 	is	the	right	word	in	design	.
it	's	just	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	try	out	to	kind	of	make	it	work	better	.
and	you	know	some	of	them	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	 terr 	 ible 	 	 chair 	 s 	 	.
some	of	them	are	kind	of	cool	looking	.	it	's	like	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	why	did	n't	they	try	that	?	``
it	was	that	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	 ite 	 rative 	 	process	which	is	so	much	like	 ver 	 na 	 cular 	 	design	and	folk	design	in	 tradition 	 al 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	that	's	one	of	the	 common 	 al 	 ities 	 	between	 modern 	 ism 	 	and	 tradition 	 al 	 	design	.	i	think	it	may	be	a	real	common	ground	 a 	 s 	 	we	kind	of	figure	out	what	on	earth	to	do	in	the	next	20	or	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	other	thing	that	's	kind	of	cool	is	that	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	in	the	media	when	people	say	design	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	mean	style	.
and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	here	to	talk	about	design	.
but	you	know	the	object	is	just	a	pivot	.
it	's	a	pivot	between	a	process	and	a	system	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	film	i	made	about	the	making	of	the	eames	 loung 	 e 	 	chair	.
the	design	process	for	charles	and	ray	never	 end 	 ed 	 	in	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
it	 continu 	 ed 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	thing	better	and	better	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	like	 a 	 s 	 	bill	clinton	was	 say 	 ing 	 	about	rwandan	health	 clinic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	create	one	.
you	've	got	to	create	a	system	that	will	work	better	and	better	.
so	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 like 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	prototype	picture	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	just	kind	of	,	you	know	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	any	more	 bas 	 ic 	 	than	that	.
you	try	 thing 	 s 	 	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	famous	chair	.
 it 	 s 	 	early	version	had	an	``	x	``	base	.	that	's	what	the	 collect 	 ors 	 	like	.
charles	and	ray	 like 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	better	.
it	 work 	 ed 	 	better	:	``	h	``	base	,	much	more	practical	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	splint	.
and	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	dean	kamen	's	work	for	the	 militar 	 y 	 	,	or	for	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	charles	and	ray	designed	a	 mold 	 ed 	 	 ply 	 wood 	 	splint	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	.
and	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	furniture	before	.
but	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 splint 	 s 	 	they	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	process	,	which	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	them	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	show	you	too	much	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	you	to	 re 	 ally 	 	get	a	 bro 	 th 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 image 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	house	that	charles	and	ray	designed	.
my	sister	is	chasing	 some 	 one 	 	else	.	it	's	not	me	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	endorse	 heart 	 ily 	 	the	fact	that	he	stole	her	 di 	 ary 	 	,	it	's	not	me	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	film	,	on	the	lower	left	,	that	charles	and	ray	made	.
now	look	at	that	plastic	chair	.
the	house	is	1949	.
the	chair	is	 d 	 one 	 	in	1949	.
charles	and	ray	,	they	did	n't	obsess	about	style	for	it	's	own	sake	.
they	did	n't	say	,	``	our	style	is	 curv 	 es 	 	.	let	's	make	the	house	 curv 	 y 	 	.	``
they	did	n't	say	,	``	our	style	is	 grid 	 s 	 	.	let	's	make	the	chair	 grid 	 dy 	 	.	``
they	focused	on	the	need	.
they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	solve	the	design	problem	.
charles	used	to	say	,	``	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	to	which	you	have	a	design	style	is	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	to	which	you	have	not	 solve 	 d 	 	the	design	problem	.	``
it	's	kind	of	a	brutal	quote	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	design	of	that	house	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	 manage 	 d 	 	to	figure	out	a	way	to	make	a	prototype	of	a	house	--	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	medium	.
here	's	a	film	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	.
the	``	 power 	 s 	 	of	ten	``	is	a	film	they	made	.
if	we	watch	the	next	clip	,	you	're	going	to	see	the	first	version	of	``	 power 	 s 	 	of	ten	,	``	upper	left	.
the	familiar	one	on	the	lower	right	.
the	eames	'	film	 top 	 s 	 	,	lower	left	.
and	a	lamp	that	charles	designed	for	a	church	.
video	:	which	in	turn	 belong 	 s 	 	to	a	local	group	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
these	form	part	of	a	 group 	 ing 	 	system	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	 star 	 s 	 	do	.
they	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	and	so	 vari 	 ed 	 	that	from	 th 	 is 	 	distance	they	appear	like	the	 star 	 s 	 	from	earth	.
ed	:	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	film	,	and	what	's	so	great	about	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 con 	 ference 	 	is	that	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	scale	.
 every 	 body 	 	here	is	coming	at	it	from	a	different	way	.
i	want	to	give	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
e.o	.	wilson	once	told	me	that	when	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	ants	--	he	 love 	 d 	 	them	,	of	course	,	and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	learn	more	about	them	--	he	 conscious 	 ly 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	them	from	the	 stand 	 point 	 	of	scale	.
so	here	is	the	 tin 	 y 	 	creature	.
and	yet	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	changing	the	frame	of	 re 	 ference 	 	it	 reveal 	 s 	 	so	much	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	what	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	the	ted	prize	.
 model 	 ing 	 	,	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	 model 	 ing 	 	all	the	time	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 model 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	part	of	that	is	that	they	never	 deleg 	 ated 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	think	in	our	family	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	design	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
design	was	not	 some 	 thing 	 	other	.
it	was	part	of	the	business	of	life	in	general	.
it	was	part	of	the	quality	of	life	.
and	here	is	some	family	 picture 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	see	why	i	'm	down	on	style	,	with	a	 hair 	 cut 	 	like	that	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	i	remember	the	cut	 grape 	 fruit 	 	that	we	would	have	at	the	eames	house	when	i	was	a	kid	.
so	we	're	going	to	watch	 an 	 other 	 	film	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	film	,	the	one	 call 	 ed 	 	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	me	,	i	have	the	same	 hair 	 cut 	 	,	in	the	upper	right	corner	.
upper	left	is	a	film	they	did	on	 to 	 y 	 	 train 	 s 	 	.
lower	right	is	a	solar	do	-	 noth 	 ing 	 	 to 	 y 	 	.
lower	left	is	day	-	of	-	the	-	dead	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
charles	used	to	say	that	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	are	not	 a 	 s 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	appear	.
they	are	often	the	 pre 	 cursor 	 	to	 big 	 ger 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 idea 	 s 	 	--	that	train	up	there	,	 be 	 ing 	 	about	the	honest	use	of	 material 	 s 	 	,	is	 total 	 ly 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	honest	use	of	 material 	 s 	 	in	the	 ply 	 wood 	 	.
and	now	i	'm	going	to	test	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	letter	that	my	 grand 	 father 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	to	my	mom	when	she	was	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
so	can	you	read	it	?
lucia	angel	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	eye	.
audience	:	saw	 man 	 y 	 	 train 	 s 	 	.
ed	:	awl	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	good	that	the	leather	 craft 	 er 	 	's	guild	is	here	.

dawn	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
 al 	 so 	 	 rod 	 e 	 	on	one	.	i	...
audience	:	you	had	,	i	hope	you	had	--	ed	:	now	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	of	saint	louis	in	the	late	,	in	the	mid	-	1930	's	,	then	you	'd	know	that	was	a	great	dane	.
so	,	i	hope	you	had	a	audience	:	nice	time	,	time	--	ed	:	time	at	.

i	hope	you	had	a	nice	time	at	 bud 	 dy 	 	's	party	.	``
so	you	 guy 	 s 	 	did	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	,	cool	.
so	my	mom	and	charles	had	 th 	 is 	 	great	relationship	where	they	'd	 s 	 end 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	back	and	forth	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	it	's	all	part	of	the	,	you	know	,	they	used	to	say	,	``	take	your	pleasure	 serious 	 ly 	 	.	``
these	are	some	 image 	 s 	 	from	a	project	of	mine	that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	kymaerica	.
it	's	sort	of	an	 alter 	 native 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
it	's	kind	of	a	 re 	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 pla 	 que 	 s 	 	are	 pla 	 que 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 install 	 ing 	 	around	north	america	.
we	're	about	to	do	six	in	the	u.k.	next	week	.
and	they	honor	 event 	 s 	 	in	the	linear	world	from	the	 fiction 	 al 	 	world	.
so	,	of	course	,	since	it	's	 bron 	 ze 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	true	.
video	:	kymaerica	with	 water 	 fall 	 s 	 	,	tumbling	through	our	--	ed	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	kymaerican	 song 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	had	 spell 	 ing 	 	bees	in	paris	,	illinois	.
video	:	your	word	is	n.	carolina	.
girl	:	y	-	i	-	n	-	d	-	i	-	a	-	n	-	a	.
ed	:	and	then	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	row	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 historic 	 al 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	kymaerican	story	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	parisian	diaspora	 start 	 ed 	 	,	where	there	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	was	.
so	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	visit	and	have	 th 	 is 	 	three	-	dimensional	 fiction 	 al 	 	experience	there	.
and	the	town	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 embrace 	 d 	 	it	.
we	had	the	 spell 	 ing 	 	bee	in	 con 	 junction 	 	with	the	gwomeus	club	.
but	what	is	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	is	that	we	take	our	visual	environment	 a 	 s 	 	 inevit 	 able 	 	.	and	it	's	not	.
other	 thing 	 s 	 	could	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	the	japanese	could	have	 discover 	 ed 	 	monterey	.
and	we	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	born	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	there	are	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	museum	of	the	bench	.
they	have	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	 card 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	cool	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	you	're	kind	of	trapped	in	the	 text 	 ure 	 	of	kymaerica	.
the	tahatchabe	,	the	great	road	building	culture	.
a	guy	named	nobu	naga	,	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	japanese	columbus	.
but	now	i	'm	going	to	return	you	to	the	real	world	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	cranbrook	.	i	've	got	a	real	treat	for	you	,	which	is	the	first	film	that	charles	ever	made	.
so	let	's	watch	that	.	 no 	 body 	 	's	ever	 s 	 een 	 	it	.
cranbrook	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	to	let	us	show	it	for	the	first	time	here	.
it	's	a	film	about	maya	gretel	,	a	famous	 ceramic 	 ist 	 	,	and	a	teacher	at	cranbrook	.
and	he	made	it	for	the	1939	 facul 	 ty 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	.
silent	.	we	do	n't	have	a	track	for	it	yet	.
 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.	it	's	just	a	start	.	but	it	's	that	learn	-	by	-	 do 	 ing 	 	thing	.
you	want	to	learn	how	to	make	 film 	 s 	 	?	go	make	a	movie	.
and	you	try	 some 	 thing 	 	out	.
but	here	is	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	great	.
see	that	chair	there	?	the	 o 	 range 	 	one	?	that	's	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	chair	.	1940	.
at	the	same	time	that	charles	was	 do 	 ing 	 	that	chair	,	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	film	.
so	my	point	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	scope	of	vision	,	 th 	 is 	 	 hol 	 istic 	 	vision	of	design	,	was	with	them	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
it	was	n't	like	``	oh	,	we	made	some	 chair 	 s 	 	and	got	 success 	 ful 	 	.
now	we	're	going	to	do	some	 movie 	 s 	 	.	``
it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	part	of	how	they	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	world	.	and	that	's	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
and	i	think	that	all	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	design	forward	,	it	's	not	about	just	 do 	 ing 	 	one	thing	.
it	's	about	how	you	approach	 problem 	 s 	 	.	and	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	huge	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 common 	 ality 	 	between	design	,	business	and	the	world	.
so	we	're	going	to	do	the	last	clip	.
and	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	some	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	.	i	just	want	to	focus	on	sound	now	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	charles	'	voice	.
charles	eames	:	in	india	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 with 	 out 	 	,	and	the	 low 	 est 	 	in	 cast 	 e 	 	,	eat	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	southern	india	,	they	eat	off	of	a	banana	leaf	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	a	little	bit	up	the	scale	eat	off	of	a	sort	of	a	low	-	 fire 	 d 	 	ceramic	dish	.
and	a	little	bit	 high 	 er 	 	,	why	they	have	a	 glaz 	 e 	 	on	a	thing	they	call	a	 th 	 ali 	 	.
if	you	're	up	the	scale	a	little	bit	more	,	why	,	a	 bra 	 s 	 s 	 	 th 	 ali 	 	.
and	then	 thing 	 s 	 	get	to	be	a	little	 question 	 able 	 	.
there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	like	silver	-	plated	 th 	 ali 	 s 	 	.
and	there	is	solid	silver	 th 	 ali 	 s 	 	.
and	i	suppose	some	nut	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	gold	 th 	 ali 	 	that	he	's	eaten	off	of	.
but	you	can	go	beyond	that	.
and	the	 guy 	 s 	 	that	have	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	but	a	certain	amount	of	knowledge	and	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	go	to	the	next	step	,	and	they	eat	off	a	banana	leaf	.
and	i	think	that	in	these	 time 	 s 	 	when	we	fall	back	and	 re 	 group 	 	,	that	 some 	 how 	 	or	other	,	the	banana	leaf	 par 	 able 	 	sort	of	got	to	get	 work 	 ing 	 	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	not	prepared	to	say	that	the	banana	leaf	that	one	eats	off	of	is	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	other	eats	off	of	.
but	it	is	that	process	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	man	that	 change 	 s 	 	the	banana	leaf	.
ed	:	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	forward	to	sharing	that	quote	with	you	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	part	of	where	we	've	got	to	get	to	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
``	beyond	the	age	of	information	is	the	age	of	 choice 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	's	where	we	are	.
and	it	's	kind	of	cool	for	me	to	be	part	of	a	family	and	a	tradition	where	he	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	that	in	1978	.
and	part	of	why	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	 import 	 ant 	 	and	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	are	 import 	 ant 	 	,	is	that	these	are	the	 idea 	 s 	 	we	need	.
and	i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	part	of	 surrender 	 ing 	 	to	the	design	journey	.
that	's	what	we	all	need	to	do	.
design	is	not	just	for	 design 	 ers 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.	it	's	a	process	.	it	's	not	style	.
all	that	great	 think 	 ing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	get	about	solving	 pre 	 tty 	 	key	 problem 	 s 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	thank	you	for	your	time	.
