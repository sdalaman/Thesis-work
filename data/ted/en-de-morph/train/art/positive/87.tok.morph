``	ah	,	the	first	time	that	i	made	love	to	a	rock	shrimp	.	.	.	``
it	's	true	.	some	people	say	to	me	,	they	say	,	``	ze	,	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	stuff	,	and	you	're	not	making	any	money	.
``	why	?	``	and	i	say	,	``	mom	,	dad	--	``	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	.	``	you	know	,	i	do	n't	know	if	you	're	all	aware	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	the	video	--	the	video	game	market	,	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 play 	 ing 	 	these	video	 game 	 s 	 	,	oh	,	but	,	 suppose 	 d 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	 ton 	 s 	 	of	money	.

and	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	for	a	quarter	,	you	can	play	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	long	time	.
and	chris	had	 s 	 aid 	 	in	an	email	that	,	you	know	,	we	should	 re 	 ally 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	new	to	ted	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	have	n't	 show 	 n 	 	 any 	 one 	 	.
so	,	i	made	 th 	 is 	 	for	ted	.	it	's	``	christian	.	``
it	's	the	third	in	the	 s 	 eries 	 	.
i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	it	's	going	to	do	well	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
do	you	have	a	 pre 	 ference 	 	?	good	choice	.
so	you	can	wait	for	the	second	coming	--	which	is	--	a	random	number	between	one	and	500	million	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	what	are	we	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	?	oh	,	tech	joy	.
tech	joy	,	to	me	,	 mean 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	get	a	lot	of	joy	out	of	tech	.
and	in	fact	,	making	 thing 	 s 	 	using	technology	--	and	i	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	serious	here	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	using	my	 s 	 ar 	 cast 	 ic 	 	voice	--	i	wo	n't	--	hold	on	.	making	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	know	--	making	 thing 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	give	me	a	lot	of	joy	.
it	's	the	process	of	creation	that	 keep 	 s 	 	me	sort	of	a	bubble	and	a	half	above	 perpetu 	 al 	 	 anxie 	 ty 	 	in	my	life	,	and	it	's	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	about	80	percent	complete	on	a	project	--	where	you	know	you	still	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	,	but	it	's	not	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	and	you	're	not	 start 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 fill 	 s 	 	my	entire	life	.
and	so	,	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	creating	 on 	 line 	 	social	 space 	 s 	 	to	share	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	with	people	who	do	n't	consider	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	.
we	're	in	a	culture	of	guru	-	ship	.	it	's	so	hard	to	use	some	 soft 	 ware 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	it	's	 un 	 approach 	 able 	 	,	people	feel	like	they	have	to	read	the	manual	.
so	i	try	to	--	--	i	try	to	create	these	 ver 	 y 	 	minimal	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	allow	people	to	express	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	--	 who 	 a 	 	,	i	'm	like	--	on	the	page	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	.
it	's	,	like	--	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	--	i	try	to	create	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	for	people	to	express	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
here	i	 create 	 d 	 	a	contest	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	when	 off 	 ice 	 	 suppli 	 es 	 	attack	,	``	which	,	i	think	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 reson 	 ated 	 	with	the	--	 work 	 ing 	 	population	.
over	500	 ent 	 ries 	 	in	three	 week 	 s 	 	,	toilet	paper	fashion	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	people	from	all	over	the	country	 do 	 ing 	 	--	the	watch	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
 on 	 line 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	--	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	lot	of	them	.
i	think	they	're	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
i	think	it	's	a	chance	for	people	to	get	to	play	with	 cray 	 on 	 s 	 	and	all	that	kind	of	stuff	.	but	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	process	,	the	process	of	creating	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	real	event	that	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
and	the	problem	is	that	a	lot	of	people	suck	at	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	get	 bum 	 med 	 	out	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	sort	of	,	you	know	,	stick	figure	,	awful	little	thing	that	they	 create 	 d 	 	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	it	just	 make 	 s 	 	them	stop	 play 	 ing 	 	with	it	,	or	draw	,	you	know	,	they	draw	 penis 	 es 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
so	,	the	scribbler	is	an	attempt	to	create	a	generative	tool	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	 help 	 ing 	 	tool	.
you	can	draw	your	simple	stick	figure	,	and	then	it	 collabor 	 ates 	 	with	you	to	create	,	sort	of	,	like	,	a	post	-	war	german	 etch 	 ing 	 	.
so	you	can	--	in	fact	,	it	's	tuned	to	be	better	at	 draw 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	look	 wo 	 rse 	 	.	so	,	we	go	 a 	 head 	 	,	and	we	start	 s 	 crib 	 bling 	 	,	and	--	so	the	idea	is	that	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	,	you	know	,	 par 	 take 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	but	watch	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 crap 	 py 	 	look	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	here	are	some	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	little	trap	 mar 	 ion 	 ette 	 	that	was	 submit 	 ted 	 	to	me	.	here	we	are	,	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	.
 darl 	 ing 	 	.	 beaut 	 iful 	 	stuff	.
i	mean	 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	11	-	year	-	old	girl	--	drew	 th 	 is 	 	and	 submit 	 ted 	 	it	.	it	's	just	 gorge 	 ous 	 	.
i	'm	--	i	'm	dead	serious	here	.	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	joke	.
but	,	i	think	,	it	's	a	--	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 un 	 	and	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	fiction	project	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 on 	 line 	 	space	,	which	is	--	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 refurbish 	 ed 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	board	that	 encourag 	 es 	 	 collabor 	 ative 	 	fiction	writing	.
these	are	 haiku 	 s 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 haiku 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	written	by	the	same	person	,	and	in	fact	,	no	line	was	--	you	know	,	each	line	is	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	by	a	different	person	at	a	different	--	at	a	different	time	.
i	think	that	the	``	now	 ti 	 ed 	 	up	,	 ti 	 ed 	 	down	,	 mi 	 stress 	 	cruel	 approach 	 es 	 	me	,	now	 ti 	 ed 	 	down	,	it	's	up	.	``
it	's	--	it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	way	,	and	i	'll	tell	you	,	if	you	come	home	,	and	your	spouse	,	or	 who 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	let	's	talk	``	--	that	,	like	,	 chill 	 s 	 	you	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	core	.
but	it	's	 per 	 iph 	 er 	 al 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	like	these	,	that	allow	people	to	get	together	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	to	know	each	other	,	and	it	's	sort	of	like	low	-	threshold	 per 	 iph 	 er 	 al 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	i	think	are	the	key	to	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	up	some	of	our	 bond 	 ing 	 	social	capital	that	we	're	 lack 	 ing 	 	.	and	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	--	i	love	 puppet 	 s 	 	.	here	's	a	puppet	.
it	 dance 	 s 	 	to	music	.	lotte	reiniger	,	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	shadow	 puppet 	 eer 	 	in	the	'20s	,	that	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	more	elaborate	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 puppet 	 s 	 	,	and	i	just	want	to	show	one	last	thing	to	you	.
oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	make	 puppet 	 s 	 	.
