 th 	 is 	 	is	ralph	stanley	.
when	i	was	going	to	college	at	university	of	california	at	santa	barbara	in	the	college	of	creative	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	taking	 major 	 s 	 	in	biology	and	art	,	he	came	to	the	campus	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	in	1968	,	i	guess	it	was	.
and	he	 play 	 ed 	 	his	 blue 	 grass 	 	style	of	music	,	but	near	the	end	of	the	concert	,	he	 play 	 ed 	 	the	old	 tim 	 ing 	 	style	of	banjo	 pick 	 ing 	 	that	came	from	africa	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	banjo	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	claw	-	hammer	style	,	that	he	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	his	mother	and	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
i	fell	in	love	with	that	.
i	went	up	to	him	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	how	can	i	learn	that	?
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	you	can	go	back	to	clinch	mountain	,	where	i	'm	from	,	or	asheville	or	mount	airy	,	north	carolina	--	some	place	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	music	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	old	people	still	living	that	play	that	old	style	.
so	i	went	back	that	 ver 	 y 	 	summer	.
i	just	fell	in	love	with	the	culture	and	the	people	.
and	you	know	,	i	came	back	to	school	,	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	my	 degree 	 s 	 	and	told	my	 parent 	 s 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	banjo	player	.
you	can	imagine	how	 excit 	 ed 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
so	i	thought	i	would	just	like	to	show	you	some	of	the	 picture 	 s 	 	i	've	taken	of	some	of	my	 mentor 	 s 	 	.
just	a	few	of	them	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	you	'll	get	just	a	little	hint	of	some	of	these	 folk 	 s 	 	.
and	play	a	little	banjo	.	let	's	do	a	little	 med 	 ley 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	last	few	 picture 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	of	ray	hicks	,	who	just	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	last	year	.
he	was	one	of	the	great	american	folk	tale	-	 teller 	 s 	 	.
the	old	jack	 tale 	 s 	 	that	he	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	--	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	could	 hard 	 ly 	 	understand	him	.	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
and	he	lived	in	that	house	that	his	great	-	 grand 	 father 	 	had	built	.
no	running	water	,	no	 electric 	 ity 	 	.	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	guy	.
and	you	can	look	at	more	 picture 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	's	got	a	bunch	of	 photo 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	of	some	of	the	other	 folk 	 s 	 	i	did	n't	get	a	chance	to	show	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	instrument	came	up	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	mouth	bow	.
it	is	 definite 	 ly 	 	the	first	 string 	 ed 	 	instrument	ever	in	the	world	,	and	still	 play 	 ed 	 	in	the	southern	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	old	 timer 	 s 	 	did	n't	take	a	 f 	 ancy 	 	guitar	string	and	make	 any 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	would	just	take	a	stick	and	a	 cat 	 gut 	 	and	string	it	up	.
it	was	hard	on	the	 cat 	 s 	 	,	but	it	made	a	great	little	instrument	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
well	,	have	you	heard	the	 man 	 y 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	told	by	young	and	old	with	joy	about	the	 man 	 y 	 	 de 	 ed 	 s 	 	of	 da 	 ring 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	the	johnson	 boy 	 s 	 	?
you	take	kate	,	i	'll	take	sal	;	we	'll	both	have	a	johnson	gal	.
you	take	kate	,	i	'll	take	sal	;	we	'll	both	have	a	johnson	gal	.
now	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 scout 	 s 	 	in	the	 rebel 	 s 	 	'	 arm 	 y 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	known	both	far	and	wide	.
when	the	yankees	saw	them	coming	,	they	'd	lay	down	 the 	 ir 	 	 gun 	 s 	 	and	hide	.
you	take	kate	,	i	'll	take	sal	;	we	'll	both	have	a	johnson	gal	.
you	take	kate	,	i	'll	take	sal	;	we	'll	both	have	a	johnson	gal	.
ai	n't	that	a	sound	?
well	,	it	was	1954	,	i	guess	it	was	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	in	the	car	 out 	 side 	 	of	gatesville	,	texas	,	where	i	grew	up	in	the	early	part	of	my	life	.
 out 	 side 	 	of	gatesville	we	 we 	 re 	 	coming	back	from	the	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	.
my	mom	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	;	my	brother	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	back	seat	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	mad	at	my	mom	.	we	 look 	 ed 	 	out	the	window	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 acre 	 s 	 	of	cotton	 field 	 s 	 	.
you	see	,	we	'd	just	 be 	 en 	 	to	the	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	,	and	my	mom	 re 	 fused 	 	to	buy	us	the	jar	of	ovaltine	that	had	the	 coup 	 on 	 	for	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	 mid 	 night 	 	 decode 	 r 	 	ring	in	it	.
and	,	 bud 	 dy 	 	,	that	made	us	mad	.
well	,	my	mom	did	n't	put	up	with	much	either	,	and	she	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	 boy 	 s 	 	!	you	think	you	can	have	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	.
you	do	n't	know	how	hard	it	is	to	earn	money	.	your	dad	 work 	 s 	 	so	hard	.
you	think	money	 grow 	 s 	 	on	 tree 	 s 	 	.	you	've	never	 work 	 ed 	 	a	day	in	your	 live 	 s 	 	.
you	 boy 	 s 	 	make	me	so	mad	.	you	're	going	to	get	a	job	 th 	 is 	 	summer	.	``
she	 pull 	 ed 	 	the	car	over	;	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	get	out	of	the	car	.	``
my	brother	and	i	 steppe 	 d 	 	out	of	the	car	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	edge	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 acre 	 s 	 	of	cotton	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	about	a	hundred	black	 folk 	 s 	 	out	there	 pick 	 ing 	 	.
my	mom	 grab 	 bed 	 	us	by	the	 shoulder 	 s 	 	.	she	 march 	 ed 	 	us	out	in	the	field	.
she	went	up	to	the	 fore 	 man 	 	;	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	got	these	two	little	 boy 	 s 	 	never	 work 	 ed 	 	a	day	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.	``
of	course	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	eight	and	10	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	would	you	put	them	to	work	?	``
well	,	that	must	have	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	a	funny	idea	to	that	 fore 	 man 	 	:	put	these	two	middle	-	class	little	white	 boy 	 s 	 	out	in	a	cotton	field	in	august	in	texas	--	it	's	hot	.
so	he	 g 	 ave 	 	us	each	a	cotton	 s 	 ack 	 	,	about	10	feet	long	,	about	that	big	around	,	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 pick 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	cotton	is	soft	but	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	plant	is	just	full	of	 stick 	 ers 	 	.
and	if	you	do	n't	know	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	your	 hand 	 s 	 	are	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	in	no	time	.
and	my	brother	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	pick	it	,	and	our	 hand 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 in 	 	'	to	 ble 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	--	``	mom	!	``
and	mom	was	just	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	by	the	car	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
she	was	n't	going	to	give	up	.
well	,	the	 fore 	 man 	 	could	see	he	was	in	over	his	head	,	i	guess	.
he	kind	of	just	snuck	up	 be 	 hind 	 	us	and	he	 s 	 ang 	 	out	in	a	low	voice	.
he	just	 s 	 ang 	 	:	``	well	,	there	's	a	long	white	robe	in	heaven	,	i	know	.
do	n't	want	it	to	 leav 	 e 	 	me	 be 	 hind 	 	.
well	,	there	's	a	long	white	robe	in	heaven	,	i	know	.
do	n't	want	it	to	 leav 	 e 	 	me	 be 	 hind 	 	.	``
and	from	all	around	 a 	 s 	 	people	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	and	 answer 	 ing 	 	back	,	he	 s 	 ang 	 	:	``	good	news	,	good	news	:	 cha 	 riot 	 	's	coming	.
good	news	:	 cha 	 riot 	 	's	coming	.
good	news	:	 cha 	 riot 	 	's	coming	.
and	i	do	n't	want	it	to	 leav 	 e 	 	me	 be 	 hind 	 	.	``
now	,	my	brother	and	i	had	never	heard	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	in	our	whole	 live 	 s 	 	.	it	was	so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
we	 s 	 at 	 	there	all	day	 pick 	 ing 	 	cotton	,	 with 	 out 	 	 complain 	 ing 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	,	while	they	 s 	 ang 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	:	``	oh	,	mary	,	do	n't	you	weep	,	do	n't	you	moan	``	and	``	 wa 	 de 	 	in	the	water	,	``	and	``	i	 d 	 one 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	``	``	 th 	 is 	 	little	light	of	mine	.	``
 final 	 ly 	 	,	by	the	end	of	the	day	,	we	'd	each	 pick 	 ed 	 	about	a	quarter	of	a	bag	of	cotton	.
but	the	 fore 	 man 	 	was	kind	 en 	 ough 	 	to	give	us	each	a	check	for	a	dollar	,	but	my	mother	would	never	let	us	cash	it	.
i	'm	57	;	still	have	the	check	.
now	,	my	mother	 hop 	 ed 	 	that	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	that	the	value	of	hard	work	.
but	if	you	have	children	,	you	know	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	often	work	that	way	.
no	,	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
the	first	thing	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	day	was	that	i	never	ever	 want 	 ed 	 	to	work	that	hard	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	never	did	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	some	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	do	have	to	work	that	hard	every	day	,	and	that	was	an	eye	-	 open 	 er 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	a	great	song	can	make	hard	work	go	a	little	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	can	 br 	 ing 	 	the	group	together	in	a	way	that	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	can	.
now	,	i	was	just	a	little	eight	-	year	-	old	boy	that	day	when	my	mama	put	me	out	of	the	car	in	that	hot	texas	cotton	field	.
i	was	n't	even	aware	of	music	--	not	even	aware	of	it	.
but	that	day	in	the	cotton	field	out	there	 pick 	 ing 	 	,	when	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	i	was	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	heart	of	real	music	,	and	that	's	where	i	've	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	ever	since	.
try	 th 	 is 	 	old	song	with	me	.	i	 s 	 ing 	 	:	well	,	there	's	a	long	white	robe	in	heaven	,	i	know	.

well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	steel	guitar	.	it	's	an	american	-	made	instrument	.
it	was	 original 	 ly 	 	made	by	the	dopyera	 brother 	 s 	 	,	who	 lat 	 er 	 	on	made	the	dobro	,	which	is	a	wood	-	bodied	instrument	with	a	metal	 con 	 e 	 	for	--	where	the	sound	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
it	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	flat	on	your	lap	.
it	was	made	to	play	hawaiian	music	back	in	the	1920s	,	before	they	had	electric	 guitar 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	loud	guitar	.
and	then	african	-	american	 folk 	 s 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	you	could	take	a	broken	bottle	neck	,	just	like	that	--	a	nice	merlot	 work 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.

break	it	off	,	put	it	on	your	finger	,	and	slide	 in 	 to 	 	the	 note 	 s 	 	.

and	you	know	,	at	the	top	of	the	list	,	of	course	,	 we 	 re 	 	jenny	,	and	my	son	,	zeb	,	my	 parent 	 s 	 	--	i	did	n't	want	to	hurt	them	.
but	then	,	when	i	thought	about	it	beyond	that	,	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	care	about	--	i	had	a	radio	show	,	i	have	a	radio	show	on	public	radio	,	``	riverwalk	,	``	i	did	n't	care	about	that	.	i	did	n't	care	about	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	or	money	or	 any 	 thing 	 	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	.	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
on	the	list	it	would	be	stuff	like	,	 see 	 ing 	 	the	daffodils	bloom	in	the	spring	,	the	smell	of	new	-	mown	hay	,	 catch 	 ing 	 	a	wave	and	 body 	 surfing 	 	,	the	touch	of	a	baby	's	hand	,	the	sound	of	doc	watson	 play 	 ing 	 	the	guitar	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	old	 record 	 s 	 	of	 mud 	 dy 	 	 water 	 s 	 	and	uncle	dave	macon	.
and	for	me	,	the	sound	of	a	steel	guitar	,	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	my	 parent 	 s 	 	'	 neighbor 	 s 	 	just	 g 	 ave 	 	me	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	would	 s 	 it 	 	around	with	it	,	and	i	did	n't	know	how	to	play	it	,	but	i	would	just	play	stuff	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	play	.
and	it	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	instrument	that	,	of	all	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	i	play	,	that	would	 re 	 ally 	 	make	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	song	that	came	out	of	that	.
well	,	i	hear	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	trouble	.
lord	,	i	hate	to	hear	that	news	.
if	you	want	to	talk	about	it	,	you	know	,	i	will	listen	to	you	through	.
 word 	 s 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	say	it	;	let	me	tell	you	what	i	 al 	 ways 	 	do	.
i	just	break	off	 an 	 other 	 	 bottle 	 neck 	 	and	play	these	steel	guitar	 blue 	 s 	 	.
people	say	,	``	oh	,	snap	out	of	it	!	``
oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	 eas 	 ier 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	than	 d 	 one 	 	.
while	you	can	 hard 	 ly 	 	move	,	they	're	running	around	 hav 	 ing 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	think	it	's	better	just	to	sink	way	down	in	your	 funk 	 y 	 	mood	'	til	you	can	rise	up	humming	these	steel	guitar	 blue 	 s 	 	.
now	,	you	can	try	to	keep	it	all	 in 	 side 	 	with	drink	and	 drug 	 s 	 	and	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	,	but	you	know	that	's	not	going	to	get	you	where	you	want	to	get	.
but	i	got	some	medicine	here	that	just	might	shake	 thing 	 s 	 	loose	.
call	me	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	after	a	dose	of	these	steel	guitar	 blue 	 s 	 	.
open	up	now	.
oh	,	i	think	i	've	got	time	to	tell	you	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	my	dad	was	an	inventor	.
we	 move 	 d 	 	to	california	when	sputnik	went	up	,	in	1957	.
and	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 gyros 	 cope 	 s 	 	;	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	number	of	 patent 	 s 	 	for	that	kind	of	thing	.
and	we	 move 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	street	from	michael	and	john	whitney	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	about	my	age	.
john	went	on	,	and	michael	did	too	,	to	 be 	 come 	 	some	of	the	 inventor 	 s 	 	of	computer	 anim 	 ation 	 	.
michael	's	dad	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	computer	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	1957	,	i	was	a	little	10	-	year	-	old	kid	;	i	did	n't	know	what	that	was	.	but	he	took	me	down	to	see	one	,	you	know	,	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	making	.	it	was	like	a	library	,	just	full	of	vacuum	 tube 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	you	could	see	,	just	 floor 	 s 	 	and	 floor 	 s 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	some	day	you	're	going	to	be	able	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	thing	in	your	pocket	.
i	thought	,	damn	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	going	to	be	some	big	pants	!
so	that	christmas	--	 may 	 be 	 	i	've	got	time	for	 th 	 is 	 	--	that	christmas	i	got	the	 mis 	 ter 	 	wizard	 f 	 un 	 	-	o	-	rama	 chemist 	 ry 	 	set	.
well	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	an	inventor	just	like	my	dad	;	so	did	michael	.
his	great	-	 grand 	 dad 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	eli	whitney	,	the	inventor	of	the	cotton	gin	.
so	we	 look 	 ed 	 	in	that	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	commercial	 chemist 	 ry 	 	set	.
it	had	three	 chemical 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	see	:	sulfur	,	 pot 	 ass 	 ium 	 	 nitr 	 ate 	 	and	 char 	 coal 	 	.
man	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	10	,	but	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	made	 gun 	 powder 	 	.
we	made	up	a	little	batch	and	we	put	it	on	the	 drive 	 way 	 	and	we	threw	a	match	and	 p 	 hew 	 	,	it	 flare 	 d 	 	up	.	ah	,	it	was	great	.
well	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	next	thing	to	do	was	build	a	 can 	 non 	 	.
so	we	went	over	 in 	 to 	 	michael	's	 gar 	 age 	 	--	his	dad	had	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	,	and	we	put	a	pipe	in	the	vice	there	,	and	 screw 	 ed 	 	a	cap	on	the	end	of	the	pipe	,	 drill 	 ed 	 	a	hole	in	the	back	of	the	pipe	,	took	some	of	our	firecrackers	,	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	the	 fuse 	 s 	 	,	 ti 	 ed 	 	them	together	,	put	them	in	the	back	there	,	and	--	down	in	that	hole	--	and	then	 stuff 	 ed 	 	some	of	our	 gun 	 powder 	 	down	that	pipe	and	put	three	ball	 bear 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	the	top	,	in	the	 gar 	 age 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	stupid	:	we	put	up	a	sheet	of	 ply 	 wood 	 	about	five	feet	in	front	of	it	.
we	stood	back	,	we	lit	that	thing	,	and	they	flew	out	of	there	--	they	went	through	that	 ply 	 wood 	 	like	it	was	paper	.
through	the	 gar 	 age 	 	.
two	of	them	 land 	 ed 	 	in	the	side	door	of	his	new	citroen	.
we	 to 	 re 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	down	and	buried	it	in	his	 back 	 yard 	 	.
that	was	 pac 	 ific 	 	palisades	;	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	still	there	,	back	there	.
well	,	my	brother	heard	that	we	had	made	 gun 	 powder 	 	.
he	and	his	 bud 	 dies 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 old 	 er 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	mean	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	beat	us	up	if	we	did	n't	make	some	 gun 	 powder 	 	for	them	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	what	are	you	going	to	do	with	it	?
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	're	going	to	melt	it	down	and	make	rocket	fuel	.
 s 	 ure 	 	.	we	'll	make	you	a	big	batch	.
so	we	made	them	a	big	batch	,	and	it	was	in	my	--	now	,	we	'd	just	 move 	 d 	 	here	.	we	'd	just	 move 	 d 	 	to	california	.
mom	had	 red 	 one 	 	the	kitchen	;	mom	was	gone	that	day	.	we	had	a	pie	tin	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	chris	berquist	's	job	to	do	the	 melt 	 ing 	 	down	.
michael	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	way	at	the	side	of	the	kitchen	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 he 	 y 	 	,	it	's	 melt 	 ing 	 	.	 yea 	 h 	 	,	the	sulfur	's	 melt 	 ing 	 	.
no	problem	.	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	know	.	``
it	just	 flare 	 d 	 	up	,	and	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	,	and	he	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
no	hair	,	no	 eye 	 lash 	 es 	 	,	no	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	big	 wel 	 ts 	 	all	over	my	mom	's	kitchen	cabinet	;	the	air	was	the	just	full	of	black	smoke	.
she	came	home	,	she	took	that	 chemist 	 ry 	 	set	away	,	and	we	never	saw	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	we	thought	of	it	often	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	time	she	'd	cook	tuna	surprise	it	made	--	 taste 	 d 	 	 faint 	 ly 	 	of	 gun 	 powder 	 	.
so	i	like	to	invent	 thing 	 s 	 	too	,	and	i	think	i	'll	close	out	my	set	with	 some 	 thing 	 	i	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	good	while	back	.
when	drum	 machine 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	new	,	i	got	to	 think 	 ing 	 	,	why	could	n't	you	take	the	 old 	 est 	 	form	of	music	,	the	 ham 	 bone 	 	 rhythm 	 s 	 	,	and	combine	it	with	the	 new 	 est 	 	technology	?
i	call	 th 	 is 	 	 thunder 	 wear 	 	.
at	that	time	,	drum	 trigger 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	new	.
and	so	i	put	them	all	together	and	 sew 	 ed 	 	12	of	them	in	 th 	 is 	 	suit	.
i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	some	of	the	 ham 	 bone 	 	 rhythm 	 s 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	;	i	'm	going	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	same	 one 	 s 	 	.
i	have	a	trigger	here	,	trigger	here	,	here	,	here	.	right	there	.
it	's	going	to	 re 	 ally 	 	hurt	if	i	do	n't	take	that	off	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
now	,	the	drum	 trigger 	 s 	 	go	out	my	tail	here	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	drum	machine	,	and	they	can	make	 vari 	 ous 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	,	like	 drum 	 s 	 	.
so	let	me	put	them	all	together	.	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	can	change	the	 sound 	 s 	 	by	 step 	 ping 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 ped 	 al 	 	right	here	,	and	--	let	me	just	close	out	here	by	 do 	 ing 	 	you	a	little	 ham 	 bone 	 	 s 	 olo 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
thank	you	,	 folk 	 s 	 	.
