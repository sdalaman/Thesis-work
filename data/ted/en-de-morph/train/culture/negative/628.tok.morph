most	of	the	time	,	art	and	science	 star 	 e 	 	at	each	other	 a 	 cross 	 	a	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mutual	 in 	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	.
there	is	great	 con 	 fusion 	 	when	the	two	look	at	each	other	.
art	,	of	course	,	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	world	through	the	 psych 	 e 	 	,	the	 emotion 	 s 	 	--	the	 un 	 conscious 	 	at	 time 	 s 	 	--	and	of	course	the	aesthetic	.
science	 tend 	 s 	 	to	look	at	the	world	through	the	rational	,	the	 quant 	 itative 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 measur 	 ed 	 	and	 de 	 scribed 	 	--	but	it	 give 	 s 	 	art	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	 con 	 text 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
in	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	ice	survey	,	we	're	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 part 	 s 	 	of	human	 understand 	 ing 	 	together	,	to	 mer 	 ging 	 	the	art	and	science	to	the	end	of	 help 	 ing 	 	us	understand	nature	and	 human 	 ity 	 	's	relationship	with	nature	better	.
 specific 	 ally 	 	,	i	 a 	 s 	 	a	person	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	professional	nature	 photograph 	 er 	 	my	whole	adult	life	,	am	 firm 	 ly 	 	of	the	belief	that	 photograph 	 y 	 	,	video	,	film	have	tremendous	 power 	 s 	 	for	 help 	 ing 	 	us	understand	and	shape	the	way	we	think	about	nature	and	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	relationship	to	nature	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	we	're	 specific 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	of	course	,	in	ice	.
i	'm	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	it	,	the	 mut 	 ability 	 	of	it	,	the	 malle 	 ability 	 	of	it	,	and	the	fabulous	 shape 	 s 	 	in	which	it	can	carve	 it 	 self 	 	.
these	first	 image 	 s 	 	are	from	greenland	.
but	ice	 ha 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	meaning	.
ice	is	the	 can 	 ary 	 	in	the	global	coal	mine	.
it	's	the	place	where	we	can	see	and	touch	and	hear	and	feel	climate	change	in	action	.
climate	change	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	abstract	thing	in	most	of	the	world	.
 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	you	 believ 	 e 	 	in	it	is	based	on	your	sense	of	is	it	 rain 	 ing 	 	more	or	is	it	 rain 	 ing 	 	less	?
is	it	 get 	 ting 	 	 hot 	 ter 	 	or	is	it	 get 	 ting 	 	 cold 	 er 	 	?
what	do	the	computer	 model 	 s 	 	say	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	and	the	other	thing	?
all	of	that	,	strip	it	away	.	in	the	world	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	and	 al 	 pine 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	,	where	the	ice	is	,	it	's	real	and	it	's	present	.
the	 change 	 s 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	visible	.
they	're	 photograph 	 able 	 	.	they	're	 measur 	 able 	 	.
95	percent	of	the	 glaci 	 ers 	 	in	the	world	are	 re 	 treat 	 ing 	 	or	 shrink 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	 out 	 side 	 	antarctica	.
95	percent	of	the	 glaci 	 ers 	 	in	the	world	are	 re 	 treat 	 ing 	 	or	 shrink 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 precipit 	 ation 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	the	temperature	 pattern 	 s 	 	are	changing	.
there	is	no	significant	scientific	 disput 	 e 	 	about	that	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 observ 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	 measur 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	bomb	-	proof	information	.
and	the	great	 iron 	 y 	 	and	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	our	time	is	that	a	lot	of	the	general	public	 think 	 s 	 	that	science	is	still	 argu 	 ing 	 	about	that	.
science	is	not	 argu 	 ing 	 	about	that	.
in	these	 image 	 s 	 	we	see	ice	from	enormous	 glaci 	 ers 	 	,	ice	 sheet 	 s 	 	that	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	old	 break 	 ing 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	 chunk 	 s 	 	,	and	chunk	by	chunk	by	chunk	,	 ice 	 berg 	 	by	 ice 	 berg 	 	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	global	sea	level	rise	.
so	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 een 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	course	of	a	30	-	year	 care 	 er 	 	,	i	was	still	a	skeptic	about	climate	change	 un 	 til 	 	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	the	story	of	climate	change	was	based	on	computer	 model 	 s 	 	.
i	had	n't	 real 	 ized 	 	it	was	based	on	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 measure 	 ments 	 	of	what	the	 paleo 	 climate 	 s 	 	--	the	ancient	 climate 	 s 	 	--	 we 	 re 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	in	the	ice	 sheet 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	in	deep	ocean	 sediment 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	in	lake	 sediment 	 s 	 	,	tree	 ring 	 s 	 	,	and	a	lot	of	other	ways	of	 measur 	 ing 	 	temperature	.
when	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	climate	change	was	real	,	and	it	was	not	based	on	computer	 model 	 s 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	one	day	i	would	do	a	project	looking	at	 try 	 ing 	 	to	manifest	climate	change	 photograph 	 ically 	 	.
and	that	led	me	to	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
 initi 	 ally 	 	,	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 assign 	 ment 	 	--	 convention 	 al 	 	,	single	frame	,	still	 photograph 	 y 	 	.
and	one	crazy	day	,	i	got	the	idea	that	i	should	--	after	that	 assign 	 ment 	 	was	 finish 	 ed 	 	--	i	got	the	idea	that	i	should	shoot	in	time	-	lapse	 photograph 	 y 	 	,	that	i	should	station	a	camera	or	two	at	a	 glaci 	 er 	 	and	let	it	shoot	every	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	or	every	hour	or	 what 	 ever 	 	and	watch	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	over	time	.
well	,	 with 	 in 	 	about	three	 week 	 s 	 	,	i	 inc 	 aut 	 iously 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	that	idea	of	a	couple	of	time	-	lapse	 camera 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	25	time	-	lapse	 camera 	 s 	 	.
and	the	next	six	 month 	 s 	 	of	my	life	 we 	 re 	 	the	 hard 	 est 	 	time	in	my	 care 	 er 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	design	,	build	and	deploy	out	in	the	field	these	25	time	-	lapse	 camera 	 s 	 	.
they	are	powered	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	.	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	power	them	.
power	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	.	there	is	a	custom	made	computer	that	 tell 	 s 	 	the	camera	when	to	fire	.
and	these	 camera 	 s 	 	are	 position 	 ed 	 	on	 rock 	 s 	 	on	the	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	 glaci 	 ers 	 	,	and	they	look	in	on	the	 glaci 	 er 	 	from	permanent	,	 bed 	 rock 	 	 position 	 s 	 	,	and	they	watch	the	evolution	of	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
we	just	had	a	number	of	 camera 	 s 	 	out	on	the	greenland	ice	sheet	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 drill 	 ed 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ice	,	way	deep	down	 be 	 low 	 	the	 t 	 haw 	 ing 	 	level	,	and	had	some	 camera 	 s 	 	out	there	for	the	past	month	and	a	half	or	so	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	still	a	camera	out	there	right	now	.
in	any	case	,	the	 camera 	 s 	 	shoot	 rough 	 ly 	 	every	hour	.
some	of	them	shoot	every	half	hour	,	every	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	every	five	 minute 	 s 	 	.
here	's	a	time	lapse	of	one	of	the	time	-	lapse	 unit 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	made	.
i	 personal 	 ly 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	about	every	nut	,	bolt	and	 wash 	 er 	 	in	these	crazy	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	half	my	life	at	our	local	 hard 	 ware 	 	store	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 month 	 s 	 	when	we	built	these	 unit 	 s 	 	 original 	 ly 	 	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	most	of	the	major	 glaci 	 ated 	 	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	.
our	time	-	lapse	 unit 	 s 	 	are	in	alaska	,	the	rockies	,	greenland	and	iceland	,	and	we	have	repeat	 photograph 	 y 	 	 position 	 s 	 	,	that	is	 place 	 s 	 	we	just	visit	on	an	annual	 bas 	 is 	 	,	in	british	columbia	,	the	alps	and	bolivia	.
it	's	a	big	 under 	 taking 	 	.	i	stand	here	before	you	 to 	 night 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	ambassador	for	my	whole	team	.
there	's	a	lot	of	people	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	right	now	.
we	've	got	33	 camera 	 s 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	moment	.
we	just	had	33	 camera 	 s 	 	shoot	about	half	an	hour	ago	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	the	field	.	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	fantastic	amount	of	work	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	out	for	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	we	've	got	about	 an 	 other 	 	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	yet	to	go	.
that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	half	our	job	.
the	other	half	of	our	job	is	to	tell	the	story	to	the	global	public	.
you	know	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 collect 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	information	off	and	on	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	a	lot	of	it	 stay 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	science	community	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	art	 project 	 s 	 	stay	in	the	art	community	,	and	i	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	much	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	through	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	like	ted	,	and	like	our	relationship	with	the	obama	white	house	,	with	the	senate	,	with	john	kerry	,	to	influence	policy	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	possible	with	these	 picture 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 film 	 s 	 	.	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.	we	have	more	coming	.
we	have	a	 s 	 ite 	 	on	google	earth	that	google	earth	was	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	give	us	,	and	so	forth	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	need	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 im 	 mediate 	 	evidence	of	 on 	 going 	 	climate	change	right	now	.
now	,	one	bit	of	science	before	we	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	 visual 	 s 	 	.
if	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	 under 	 stood 	 	 th 	 is 	 	graph	,	and	 emblazon 	 ed 	 	it	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 fore 	 head 	 s 	 	,	there	would	be	no	further	 socie 	 tal 	 	argument	about	climate	change	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	story	that	 count 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	else	you	hear	is	just	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	and	 con 	 fusion 	 	.
key	 issue 	 s 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	400,000	year	record	.
 th 	 is 	 	exact	same	pattern	is	 s 	 een 	 	going	back	now	 al 	 most 	 	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	before	our	current	time	.
and	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	.
number	one	:	temperature	and	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	the	atmosphere	go	up	and	down	 bas 	 ically 	 	in	sync	.
you	can	see	that	from	the	 o 	 range 	 	line	and	the	blue	line	.
nature	 natural 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	to	go	up	to	280	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	.
that	's	the	natural	cycle	.
 go 	 es 	 	up	to	280	and	then	 drop 	 s 	 	for	 vari 	 ous 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	that	are	n't	 import 	 ant 	 	to	discuss	right	here	.
but	280	is	the	peak	.
right	now	,	if	you	look	at	the	top	right	part	of	that	graph	,	we	're	at	385	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	.
we	are	way	,	way	 out 	 side 	 	the	normal	,	natural	 vari 	 ability 	 	.
earth	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 f 	 ever 	 	.
in	the	past	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	temperature	of	the	earth	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	up	1.3	 degree 	 s 	 	fahrenheit	,	.75	 degree 	 s 	 	celsius	,	and	it	's	going	to	keep	going	up	 be 	 cause 	 	we	keep	 dump 	 ing 	 	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	.
at	the	rate	of	about	two	and	a	half	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	per	year	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 remorse 	 less 	 	,	 stead 	 y 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	.
we	have	to	turn	that	around	.
that	's	the	crux	,	and	 some 	 day 	 	i	hope	to	emblazon	that	 a 	 cross 	 	 time 	 s 	 	square	in	new	york	and	a	lot	of	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	off	to	the	world	of	ice	.
we	're	now	at	the	columbia	 glaci 	 er 	 	in	alaska	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	view	of	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	face	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	one	of	our	 camera 	 s 	 	saw	over	the	course	of	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
you	see	the	 glaci 	 er 	 	 flow 	 ing 	 	in	from	the	right	,	dropping	off	 in 	 to 	 	the	sea	,	camera	 shoot 	 ing 	 	every	hour	.
if	you	look	in	the	middle	 back 	 ground 	 	,	you	can	see	the	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	face	 bobb 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	like	a	yo	-	yo	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 glaci 	 er 	 	's	 float 	 ing 	 	and	it	's	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	,	and	you	're	about	to	see	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	that	 float 	 ing 	 	.
to	give	you	a	little	bit	of	a	sense	of	scale	,	that	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	face	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	about	325	feet	tall	.	that	's	32	 st 	 ories 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	little	cliff	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	a	major	 off 	 ice 	 	building	in	an	urban	center	.
the	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	face	is	the	wall	where	the	visible	ice	 break 	 s 	 	off	,	but	in	fact	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	down	 be 	 low 	 	sea	level	 an 	 other 	 	couple	thousand	feet	.
so	there	's	a	wall	of	ice	a	couple	thousand	feet	deep	going	down	to	 bed 	 rock 	 	if	the	 glaci 	 er 	 	's	 ground 	 ed 	 	on	 bed 	 rock 	 	,	and	 float 	 ing 	 	if	it	is	n't	.
here	's	what	columbia	's	 d 	 one 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	south	central	alaska	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 a 	 erial 	 	picture	i	did	one	day	in	june	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 a 	 erial 	 	picture	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
that	's	the	 re 	 treat 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 glaci 	 er 	 	.
the	main	stem	,	the	main	flow	of	the	 glaci 	 er 	 	is	coming	from	the	right	and	it	's	going	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	up	that	stem	.
we	're	going	to	be	up	there	in	just	a	few	more	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	we	expect	that	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 re 	 treat 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	half	a	mile	,	but	if	i	got	there	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	it	had	 collapse 	 d 	 	and	it	was	five	 mile 	 s 	 	further	back	,	i	would	n't	be	the	 l 	 east 	 	bit	 surprise 	 d 	 	.
now	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	grasp	the	scale	of	these	 place 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 glaci 	 ers 	 	--	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	is	that	 place 	 s 	 	like	alaska	and	greenland	are	huge	,	they	're	not	normal	 land 	 scapes 	 	--	but	 a 	 s 	 	the	 glaci 	 ers 	 	are	 re 	 treat 	 ing 	 	,	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 defl 	 ating 	 	,	like	air	is	 be 	 ing 	 	let	out	of	a	balloon	.
and	so	,	there	are	 feature 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
there	's	a	ridge	right	in	the	middle	of	the	picture	,	up	above	where	that	arrow	 come 	 s 	 	in	,	that	 show 	 s 	 	you	that	a	little	bit	.
there	's	a	marker	line	 call 	 ed 	 	the	trim	line	above	our	little	red	 illustr 	 ation 	 	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	no	self	-	 respect 	 ing 	 	 photograph 	 er 	 	would	ever	do	--	you	put	some	 che 	 es 	 y 	 	 illustr 	 ation 	 	on	your	shot	,	right	?	--	and	yet	you	have	to	do	it	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	to	narrate	these	 point 	 s 	 	.
but	,	in	any	case	,	the	 defl 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 glaci 	 er 	 	since	1984	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 high 	 er 	 	than	the	eiffel	tower	,	 high 	 er 	 	than	the	empire	state	building	.
a	tremendous	amount	of	ice	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	let	out	of	these	 val 	 ley 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 re 	 treat 	 ed 	 	and	 defl 	 ated 	 	,	gone	back	up	 val 	 ley 	 	.
these	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	 al 	 pine 	 	world	are	 accele 	 rating 	 	.
it	's	not	static	.
 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	the	world	of	sea	ice	,	the	rate	of	natural	change	is	 out 	 strip 	 ping 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	of	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	the	 process 	 es 	 	either	are	 accele 	 rating 	 	or	the	 predict 	 ions 	 	 we 	 re 	 	too	low	to	begin	with	.
but	in	any	case	,	there	are	big	,	big	 change 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	.
so	,	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	time	-	lapse	shot	of	columbia	.
and	you	see	where	it	 end 	 ed 	 	in	these	 vari 	 ous 	 	spring	 day 	 s 	 	,	june	,	may	,	then	october	.
now	we	turn	on	our	time	lapse	.

these	great	ice	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	break	off	--	and	now	watch	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 spring 	 time 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	--	a	huge	collapse	.	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	about	a	month	,	the	loss	of	all	that	ice	.
so	that	's	where	we	 start 	 ed 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	way	out	on	the	left	,	and	that	's	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	last	time	we	went	 in 	 to 	 	columbia	.
to	give	you	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	for	the	scale	of	the	 re 	 treat 	 	,	we	did	 an 	 other 	 	 che 	 es 	 y 	 	 illustr 	 ation 	 	,	with	british	double	-	decker	 bus 	 es 	 	.
if	you	line	up	295	of	 t 	 hose 	 	nose	to	tail	,	that	's	about	how	far	back	that	was	.
it	's	a	long	way	.
on	up	to	iceland	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 glaci 	 ers 	 	,	the	sólheimajökull	.
and	here	,	if	you	watch	,	you	can	see	the	 ter 	 minus 	 	 re 	 treat 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	river	 be 	 ing 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	.
you	can	see	it	 defl 	 ating 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	the	 photograph 	 ic 	 	process	,	you	would	never	see	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 visible 	 	.
you	can	stand	up	there	your	whole	life	and	you	would	never	see	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	the	camera	 record 	 s 	 	it	.
so	we	wind	time	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	now	.
we	go	back	a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	in	time	.
that	's	where	it	 start 	 ed 	 	.
that	's	where	it	 end 	 ed 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	on	up	to	greenland	.
the	 small 	 er 	 	the	ice	mass	,	the	 fast 	 er 	 	it	 respond 	 s 	 	to	climate	.
greenland	took	a	little	while	to	start	 react 	 ing 	 	to	the	 warm 	 ing 	 	climate	of	the	past	century	,	but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 gall 	 op 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	tremendous	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	temperature	up	there	.
it	's	a	big	place	.	that	's	all	ice	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	 color 	 s 	 	are	ice	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	up	to	about	two	 mile 	 s 	 	thick	,	just	a	 gig 	 antic 	 	 dom 	 e 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	in	from	the	coast	and	 rise 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	.
the	one	 glaci 	 er 	 	up	in	greenland	that	 put 	 s 	 	more	ice	 in 	 to 	 	the	global	ocean	than	all	the	other	 glaci 	 ers 	 	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	is	the	ilulissat	 glaci 	 er 	 	.
we	have	some	 camera 	 s 	 	on	the	south	edge	of	the	ilulissat	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	face	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 re 	 treat 	 	.
here	's	a	two	-	year	record	of	what	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
helicopter	in	front	of	the	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	face	for	scale	,	 quick 	 ly 	 	 dwarf 	 ed 	 	.
the	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	face	is	four	and	a	half	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	shot	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	pull	back	,	you	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	about	a	mile	and	a	half	.
so	,	imagine	how	big	 th 	 is 	 	is	and	how	much	ice	is	charging	out	.
the	 in 	 terior 	 	of	greenland	is	to	the	right	.
it	's	 flow 	 ing 	 	out	to	the	atlantic	ocean	on	the	left	.
 ice 	 berg 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	are	 roar 	 ing 	 	out	to	sea	.
we	just	 download 	 ed 	 	these	 picture 	 s 	 	a	couple	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	.	june	25th	,	 mon 	 ster 	 	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	 event 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	'll	show	you	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	in	a	second	.
 th 	 is 	 	 glaci 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 double 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	flow	speed	in	the	past	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	now	 go 	 es 	 	at	125	feet	a	day	,	 dump 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	ice	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	.
it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	go	in	these	 puls 	 es 	 	,	about	every	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	but	on	average	,	125	feet	a	day	,	twice	the	rate	it	did	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	we	had	a	team	out	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 glaci 	 er 	 	,	and	we	 record 	 ed 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	event	that	's	ever	 be 	 en 	 	put	on	film	.
we	had	nine	 camera 	 s 	 	going	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	a	couple	of	the	 camera 	 s 	 	saw	.
a	400	-	foot	-	tall	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	face	 break 	 ing 	 	off	.
huge	 ice 	 berg 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	over	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	how	big	was	that	?	it	's	hard	to	get	it	.
so	an	 illustr 	 ation 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	for	scale	.
a	mile	of	 re 	 treat 	 	in	75	 minute 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	face	,	in	that	 part 	 icular 	 	event	,	three	 mile 	 s 	 	wide	.
the	block	was	three	-	fifths	of	a	mile	deep	,	and	if	you	 compar 	 e 	 	the	expanse	of	the	 ca 	 lv 	 ing 	 	face	to	the	tower	bridge	in	london	,	about	20	 bridge 	 s 	 	wide	.
or	if	you	take	an	american	 re 	 ference 	 	,	to	the	u.s.	 cap 	 itol 	 	building	and	you	pack	3,000	 cap 	 itol 	 	 building 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	block	,	it	would	be	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	how	large	that	block	was	.
now	i	've	come	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	after	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	 th 	 is 	 	climate	change	world	that	we	do	n't	have	a	problem	of	 economic 	 s 	 	,	technology	and	public	policy	.
we	have	a	problem	of	 per 	 ception 	 	.
the	policy	and	the	 economic 	 s 	 	and	the	technology	are	serious	 en 	 ough 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	but	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	deal	with	them	.
i	'm	certain	that	we	can	.
but	what	we	have	is	a	 per 	 ception 	 	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	not	 en 	 ough 	 	people	 re 	 ally 	 	get	it	yet	.
you	're	an	elite	audience	.	you	get	it	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	in	the	major	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	world	are	an	elite	audience	that	for	the	most	part	 get 	 s 	 	it	now	.
but	we	still	need	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	people	 a 	 long 	 	with	us	.
and	that	's	where	i	think	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	like	ted	,	like	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	ice	survey	can	have	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	impact	on	human	 per 	 ception 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	us	 a 	 long 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	have	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	right	now	.
we	are	 near 	 ly 	 	on	the	edge	of	a	crisis	,	but	we	still	have	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	face	the	 great 	 est 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	our	generation	and	,	in	fact	,	of	our	century	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	,	 terr 	 ific 	 	call	to	 arm 	 s 	 	to	do	the	right	thing	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	for	the	future	.
i	hope	that	we	have	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	to	let	the	 angel 	 s 	 	of	our	better	nature	rise	to	the	occasion	and	do	what	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.	thank	you	.
