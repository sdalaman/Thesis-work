 finish 	 ed 	 	university	education	,	got	a	medical	degree	,	1986	.
and	by	the	time	i	was	an	intern	house	officer	,	i	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	afford	to	maintain	my	mother	's	13	-	year	-	old	car	--	and	i	was	a	paid	doctor	.
 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	to	why	a	lot	of	us	,	who	are	 professional 	 s 	 	,	are	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	say	,	in	diaspora	.
now	,	are	we	going	to	make	that	a	permanent	thing	,	where	we	all	get	trained	,	and	we	 leav 	 e 	 	,	and	we	do	n't	go	back	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	,	i	should	 certain 	 ly 	 	hope	not	--	 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	not	my	vision	.
all	right	,	for	good	measure	,	that	's	where	nigeria	is	on	the	african	map	,	and	just	there	is	the	 del 	 ta 	 	region	that	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 every 	 body 	 	's	heard	of	.
people	 get 	 ting 	 	 kidnap 	 ped 	 	,	where	the	oil	 come 	 s 	 	from	,	the	oil	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	think	 ha 	 s 	 	driven	us	all	crazy	in	nigeria	.

how	 man 	 y 	 	people	do	you	think	are	on	that	taxi	?
and	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	that	is	a	taxi	in	nigeria	.
and	the	capital	--	well	,	what	used	to	be	the	capital	of	nigeria	--	lagos	,	that	's	a	taxi	,	and	you	have	police	on	them	.
so	,	tell	me	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 police 	 men 	 	do	you	think	are	on	 th 	 is 	 	taxi	?	and	now	?	three	.
so	,	when	these	kind	of	people	--	and	,	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	it	's	not	just	the	police	that	use	these	 taxi 	 s 	 	in	lagos	.	we	all	do	.	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	on	one	of	these	,	and	i	did	n't	have	a	helmet	,	either	.
and	it	just	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	the	thought	of	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	one	of	us	on	a	taxi	like	 th 	 is 	 	 fall 	 s 	 	off	,	 ha 	 s 	 	an	accident	and	 need 	 s 	 	a	hospital	.
 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	some	of	us	do	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
some	of	us	do	 surviv 	 e 	 	malaria	;	we	do	 surviv 	 e 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	.
and	like	i	tell	my	family	,	and	my	wife	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	every	time	,	``	you	're	 risk 	 ing 	 	your	life	,	you	know	,	every	time	you	go	to	that	country	.	``
and	she	's	right	.	every	time	you	go	there	,	you	know	that	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	need	critical	care	--	critical	care	of	any	sort	--	if	you	have	an	accident	--	of	which	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	there	are	 accident 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	--	where	do	they	go	?
where	do	they	go	when	they	need	help	for	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	?
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	,	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	,	 aid 	 s 	 	,	tb	,	malaria	,	 ty 	 ph 	 oid 	 	--	the	list	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	where	do	they	go	when	they	're	like	me	?
when	i	go	back	home	--	and	i	do	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	i	teach	,	i	train	--	but	i	catch	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	or	i	'm	 chronic 	 ally 	 	ill	with	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	where	do	they	go	?
what	's	the	economic	impact	when	one	of	them	dies	or	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	?
i	think	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	significant	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	they	go	.
these	are	not	old	 picture 	 s 	 	and	these	are	not	from	some	 down 	 tro 	 d 	 den 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	major	hospital	.	in	fact	,	it	's	from	a	major	 teach 	 ing 	 	hospital	in	nigeria	.
now	that	is	less	than	a	year	old	,	in	an	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	.
that	's	 steril 	 izing 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	in	nigeria	.
you	remember	all	that	oil	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	i	'm	sorry	if	it	 up 	 set 	 s 	 	some	of	you	,	but	i	think	you	need	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	.	that	's	the	floor	,	ok	?
you	can	say	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	education	.
you	can	say	it	's	 hygien 	 e 	 	.	i	'm	not	 plead 	 ing 	 	poverty	.
i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	we	need	more	than	just	,	you	know	,	 vaccin 	 ation 	 	,	malaria	,	 aid 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	in	a	proper	hospital	if	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	me	out	there	.
in	fact	,	when	i	start	running	around	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	,	you	're	 cardio 	 logists 	 	in	the	u.s.	,	can	you	come	home	with	me	and	do	a	mission	?	``
i	want	them	to	think	,	``	well	there	's	some	hope	.	``
now	,	have	a	look	at	that	.	that	's	the	 anesthesio 	 logy 	 	machine	.
and	that	's	my	 special 	 ty 	 	,	right	?
 anesthesio 	 logy 	 	and	critical	care	--	look	at	that	bag	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	taped	with	tape	that	we	even	 stop 	 ped 	 	using	in	the	u.k	.
and	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	these	are	current	 picture 	 s 	 	.
now	,	if	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	u.k.	,	that	's	where	they	go	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	intensive	care	unit	in	which	i	work	.
all	right	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	slide	from	a	talk	i	 g 	 ave 	 	about	intensive	care	 unit 	 s 	 	in	nigeria	,	and	 jok 	 ing 	 ly 	 	we	refer	to	it	 a 	 s 	 	``	expensive	 s 	 care 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 scar 	 y 	 	and	it	's	expensive	,	but	we	need	to	have	it	,	ok	?
so	,	these	are	the	 problem 	 s 	 	.
there	are	no	 prize 	 s 	 	for	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	what	the	 problem 	 s 	 	are	,	are	there	?
i	think	we	all	know	.	and	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 speaker 	 s 	 	before	and	 speaker 	 s 	 	after	me	are	going	to	tell	us	even	more	 problem 	 s 	 	.
these	are	a	few	of	them	.	so	,	what	did	i	do	?
there	we	go	--	we	're	going	on	a	mission	.
we	're	going	to	do	some	open	-	heart	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.	i	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	brit	,	on	a	team	of	about	nine	american	cardiac	 surgeon 	 s 	 	,	cardiac	nurse	,	intensive	care	nurse	.
we	all	went	out	and	did	a	mission	and	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	three	of	them	so	far	.
just	so	you	know	,	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 mission 	 s 	 	,	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	in	aid	and	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 char 	 ity 	 	.	they	have	 the 	 ir 	 	place	,	but	where	do	they	go	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 every 	 one 	 	that	's	going	to	benefit	from	a	mission	.
health	is	wealth	,	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	hans	rosling	.
you	get	 wealth 	 ier 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	if	you	are	 health 	 y 	 	first	.
so	,	here	we	are	,	mission	.	big	trouble	.
open	-	heart	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	in	nigeria	--	big	trouble	.
that	's	 mi 	 ke 	 	,	 mi 	 ke 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	from	mississippi	.
 do 	 es 	 	he	look	like	he	's	happy	?
it	took	us	two	 day 	 s 	 	just	to	organize	the	place	,	but	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	know	,	we	 work 	 ed 	 	on	it	.	 do 	 es 	 	he	look	happy	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	that	's	the	medical	 ad 	 vice 	 	the	 commit 	 tee 	 	 chair 	 man 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	told	you	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	be	able	to	,	you	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	just	know	it	.	``
look	,	that	's	the	technician	we	had	.	so	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	go	on	,	all	right	?
i	got	him	to	come	with	me	--	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	tech	--	come	with	me	from	the	u.k	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	let	's	just	go	work	 th 	 is 	 	thing	out	.
see	,	that	's	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	we	have	in	nigeria	and	in	africa	 general 	 ly 	 	.
we	get	a	lot	of	 don 	 ated 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	that	's	 obsolet 	 e 	 	,	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	work	,	or	it	 work 	 s 	 	and	you	ca	n't	fix	it	.	and	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	that	,	so	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	use	it	and	we	move	on	.
but	we	had	 problem 	 s 	 	with	it	.	we	had	severe	 problem 	 s 	 	there	.
he	had	to	get	on	the	phone	.	 th 	 is 	 	guy	was	 al 	 ways 	 	on	the	phone	.
so	what	we	going	to	do	now	?
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	all	these	americans	are	here	and	 y 	 es 	 	,	one	brit	,	and	he	's	not	going	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	--	he	 think 	 s 	 	he	's	british	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	and	he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	nigerian	,	i	just	thought	about	that	.
we	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	got	it	 work 	 ing 	 	,	is	the	truth	,	but	it	was	one	of	these	.	even	 old 	 er 	 	than	the	one	you	saw	.
the	reason	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	picture	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	x	-	ray	,	it	's	just	to	tell	you	where	and	how	we	 we 	 re 	 	 view 	 ing 	 	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	.
do	you	figure	where	that	is	?	it	was	on	a	window	.
i	mean	,	what	's	an	x	-	ray	 view 	 ing 	 	box	?	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
well	,	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	's	on	pax	 any 	 way 	 	.
you	look	at	your	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	on	a	screen	and	you	do	stuff	with	them	,	you	email	them	.	but	we	 we 	 re 	 	still	using	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	,	but	we	did	n't	even	have	a	 view 	 ing 	 	box	!
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	open	-	heart	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
ok	,	i	know	it	's	not	 aid 	 s 	 	,	i	know	it	's	not	malaria	,	but	we	still	need	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	echo	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	just	to	get	the	children	ready	and	the	 adult 	 s 	 	ready	.
people	still	 believ 	 e 	 	in	voodoo	.	heart	disease	,	vsd	,	hole	in	the	heart	,	 tetra 	 logies 	 	.
you	still	get	people	who	 believ 	 e 	 	in	it	and	they	came	.

we	had	to	do	these	for	 adult 	 s 	 	.	so	,	we	did	succeed	and	we	still	do	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	three	.	we	're	 plan 	 ning 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	in	july	in	the	north	of	the	country	.	so	,	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	still	do	open	-	heart	,	but	you	can	see	the	contrast	between	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	 ship 	 ped 	 	in	--	we	ship	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 instrument 	 s 	 	.	we	had	 explosion 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	kit	was	designed	and	 install 	 ed 	 	by	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	n't	used	to	it	.
the	oxygen	 tank 	 s 	 	did	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	work	right	.
but	how	 man 	 y 	 	did	we	do	the	first	one	?	12	.
we	did	12	open	-	heart	 sur 	 gical 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	.
here	is	our	 ver 	 y 	 	first	patient	,	out	of	intensive	care	,	and	just	watch	that	chair	,	all	right	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	mean	about	appropriate	technology	.
that	's	what	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 prop 	 ping 	 	up	the	bed	 be 	 cause 	 	the	bed	 simpl 	 y 	 	did	n't	work	.
have	you	 s 	 een 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	before	?
no	?	 y 	 es 	 	?	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	,	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	or	heard	 th 	 is 	 	before	:	``	we	,	the	 will 	 ing 	 	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	so	much	with	so	little	for	so	long	--	--	we	are	now	 qual 	 ified 	 	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	``
thank	you	.	 sustain 	 able 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	my	first	company	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	's	sole	aim	is	to	provide	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	think	are	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	we	put	my	hand	in	my	pocket	and	say	,	``	 guy 	 s 	 	,	let	's	just	buy	stuff	.
let	's	go	set	up	a	company	that	 teach 	 es 	 	people	,	 educ 	 ates 	 	them	,	 give 	 s 	 	them	the	 tool 	 s 	 	they	need	to	keep	going	.	``
and	that	's	a	perfect	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	one	.
 usual 	 ly 	 	when	you	buy	a	 ventil 	 ator 	 	in	a	hospital	,	you	buy	a	different	one	for	children	,	you	buy	a	different	one	for	transport	.	 th 	 is 	 	one	will	do	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	it	will	do	it	at	half	the	price	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	 compress 	 ed 	 	air	.
if	you	're	in	america	and	you	do	n't	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	we	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	make	it	our	duty	to	find	out	what	's	appropriate	technology	for	africa	--	what	's	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	priced	,	 do 	 es 	 	the	job	,	and	we	move	on	.	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	machine	:	multi	-	parameter	monitor	,	 oper 	 ating 	 	 light 	 s 	 	,	 su 	 ction 	 	.

if	you	take	nitrogen	out	,	what	's	left	?	oxygen	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	.
so	that	's	not	new	.	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	to	it	.
