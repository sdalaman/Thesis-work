 be 	 ing 	 	a	child	,	and	sort	of	 crawl 	 ing 	 	around	the	house	,	i	remember	these	turkish	 carpet 	 s 	 	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	these	 scene 	 s 	 	,	these	battle	 scene 	 s 	 	,	these	love	 scene 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	look	,	 th 	 is 	 	animal	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	fight	back	 th 	 is 	 	spear	from	 th 	 is 	 	soldier	.
and	my	mom	took	these	 picture 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	last	week	,	of	our	 carpet 	 s 	 	,	and	i	remember	 th 	 is 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	.
there	was	 an 	 other 	 	object	,	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 tower 	 ing 	 	piece	of	furniture	with	 creature 	 s 	 	and	 gargoyle 	 s 	 	and	 nud 	 ity 	 	--	 pre 	 tty 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	stuff	,	when	you	're	a	little	kid	.
what	i	remember	 to 	 day 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 object 	 s 	 	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	,	so	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	strong	influence	in	my	work	.
and	then	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	influence	.
i	was	a	teenager	,	and	at	15	or	16	,	i	guess	like	all	 teenager 	 s 	 	,	we	want	to	just	do	what	we	love	and	what	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	.
and	so	,	i	fused	together	the	two	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 love 	 d 	 	the	most	,	which	was	 ski 	 ing 	 	and	 wind 	 surfing 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 e 	 scapes 	 	from	the	 dra 	 b 	 	weather	in	switzerland	.
so	,	i	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 compil 	 ation 	 	of	the	two	:	i	took	my	 ski 	 s 	 	and	i	took	a	board	and	i	put	a	mast	foot	in	there	,	and	some	foot	 s 	 trap 	 s 	 	,	and	some	metal	 fin 	 s 	 	,	and	here	i	was	,	going	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	on	 froze 	 n 	 	 lake 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	a	death	trap	.	i	mean	,	it	was	 in 	 credible 	 	,	it	 work 	 ed 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	well	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	then	i	had	to	go	to	design	school	.
i	mean	,	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 graphic 	 s 	 	there	.
so	,	i	went	to	design	school	,	and	it	was	the	early	'90s	when	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	saw	 some 	 thing 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	there	,	and	i	saw	that	the	computer	was	coming	 in 	 to 	 	our	 home 	 s 	 	,	that	it	had	to	change	in	order	to	be	with	us	in	our	 home 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	got	 my 	 self 	 	a	job	and	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	for	a	 consult 	 ancy 	 	,	and	we	would	get	in	to	these	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	these	 manage 	 rs 	 	would	come	in	,	and	they	would	say	,	``	well	,	what	we	're	going	to	do	here	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	you	know	.	``
and	they	would	give	the	 project 	 s 	 	code	 name 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 most 	 ly 	 	from	``	star	 war 	 s 	 	,	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	:	 thing 	 s 	 	like	c	3po	,	yoda	,	luke	.
so	,	in	 anticip 	 ation 	 	,	i	would	be	 th 	 is 	 	young	 design 	 er 	 	in	the	back	of	the	room	,	and	i	would	raise	my	hand	,	and	i	would	ask	 question 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	in	retrospect	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	stupid	 question 	 s 	 	,	but	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	what	's	 th 	 is 	 	 cap 	 s 	 	lock	key	for	?	``
or	``	what	's	 th 	 is 	 	num	lock	key	for	?	``	you	know	,	that	thing	?
``	you	know	,	do	people	 re 	 ally 	 	use	it	?
do	they	need	it	?	do	they	want	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	?	``
what	i	 real 	 ized 	 	then	is	,	they	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	change	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	stuff	;	they	did	n't	want	to	change	the	 insid 	 es 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	for	us	,	the	 design 	 ers 	 	,	to	create	the	 skin 	 s 	 	,	to	put	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	stuff	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	box	.
and	i	did	n't	want	to	be	a	 color 	 ist 	 	.
it	was	n't	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
i	did	n't	want	to	be	a	 styl 	 ist 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
and	then	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	quote	:	``	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	is	the	price	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	pay	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 un 	 original 	 	.	``
so	,	i	had	to	start	on	my	own	.	so	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	san	francisco	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	little	company	,	 fuse 	 project 	 	.
and	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	work	on	is	 import 	 ant 	 	stuff	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	not	just	work	on	the	 skin 	 s 	 	,	but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	work	on	the	entire	human	experience	.
and	so	the	first	 project 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	sort	of	humble	,	but	they	took	technology	and	 may 	 be 	 	made	it	 in 	 to 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	would	use	in	a	new	way	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	some	new	 functional 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	watch	we	made	for	mini	cooper	,	the	car	company	,	right	when	it	 launch 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	's	the	first	watch	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 dis 	 play 	 	that	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	from	 horizon 	 tal 	 	to	 vert 	 ical 	 	.
and	that	 allow 	 s 	 	me	to	check	my	timer	 discrete 	 ly 	 	,	here	,	 with 	 out 	 	 bend 	 ing 	 	my	elbow	.
and	other	 project 	 s 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	about	 match 	 ing 	 	the	human	need	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	piece	of	furniture	for	an	italian	 manufactur 	 er 	 	,	and	it	 ship 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	flat	,	and	then	it	 fold 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	coffee	table	and	a	 s 	 tool 	 	and	 what 	 not 	 	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	bit	more	 experiment 	 al 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	light	 fix 	 ture 	 	for	swarovski	,	and	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	,	it	 change 	 s 	 	shape	.
so	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	from	a	circle	,	to	a	round	,	to	a	square	,	to	a	figure	eight	.
and	just	by	 draw 	 ing 	 	on	a	little	computer	 table 	 t 	 	,	the	entire	light	 fix 	 ture 	 	 adjust 	 s 	 	to	what	shape	you	want	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	leaf	lamp	for	herman	miller	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	process	;	it	took	us	about	four	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	was	looking	for	creating	a	 un 	 ique 	 	experience	of	light	,	a	new	experience	of	light	.
so	,	we	had	to	design	both	the	light	and	the	light	bulb	.
and	that	's	a	 un 	 ique 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	i	would	say	,	in	design	.
and	the	new	experience	i	was	looking	for	is	giving	the	choice	for	the	user	to	go	from	a	warm	,	sort	of	 glow 	 ing 	 	kind	of	mood	light	,	all	the	way	to	a	bright	work	light	.
so	,	the	light	bulb	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	that	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	the	person	to	 s 	 witch 	 	,	and	to	mix	these	two	 color 	 ations 	 	.
and	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	way	:	one	just	 touch 	 es 	 	the	base	of	the	light	,	and	on	one	side	,	you	can	mix	the	 bright 	 ness 	 	,	and	on	the	other	,	the	 color 	 ation 	 	of	the	light	.
so	,	all	of	these	 project 	 s 	 	have	a	 human 	 istic 	 	sense	to	them	,	and	i	think	 a 	 s 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	we	need	to	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	how	we	can	create	a	different	relationship	between	our	work	and	the	world	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	for	business	,	or	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	,	on	some	civic	-	type	 project 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	 every 	 body 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	we	 br 	 ing 	 	value	to	business	,	value	to	the	 user 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	but	i	think	it	's	the	 value 	 s 	 	that	we	put	 in 	 to 	 	these	 project 	 s 	 	that	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	create	the	 great 	 er 	 	value	.
and	the	 value 	 s 	 	we	 br 	 ing 	 	can	be	about	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	about	 sustain 	 ability 	 	,	about	lower	power	consumption	.
you	know	,	they	can	be	about	function	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	;	they	can	be	about	business	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
but	 design 	 ers 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	the	glue	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	together	.
so	jawbone	is	a	project	that	you	're	familiar	with	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 human 	 istic 	 	technology	.
it	 feel 	 s 	 	your	skin	.	it	 rest 	 s 	 	on	your	skin	,	and	it	 know 	 s 	 	when	it	is	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
and	by	 know 	 ing 	 	when	it	is	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	rid	of	the	other	 noise 	 s 	 	that	it	 know 	 s 	 	about	,	which	is	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 noise 	 s 	 	.
but	the	other	thing	that	is	 human 	 istic 	 	about	jawbone	is	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	out	all	the	 tech 	 ie 	 	stuff	,	and	all	the	 nerd 	 y 	 	stuff	out	of	it	,	and	try	to	make	it	 a 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	.
i	mean	,	think	about	it	:	the	care	we	take	in	 select 	 ing 	 	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	,	or	 jewel 	 ry 	 	,	or	 access 	 ories 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	so	if	it	is	n't	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	belong	on	your	face	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 pur 	 suing 	 	here	.
but	how	we	work	on	jawbone	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
i	want	to	point	at	 some 	 thing 	 	here	,	on	the	left	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	board	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 side 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	work	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	design	process	:	there	's	 some 	 body 	 	changing	the	board	,	 put 	 ting 	 	 trac 	 ers 	 	on	the	board	,	changing	the	location	of	the	ics	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 design 	 ers 	 	on	the	other	side	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	work	.
so	,	it	's	not	about	 s 	 lap 	 ping 	 	 skin 	 s 	 	,	 any 	 more 	 	,	on	a	technology	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 design 	 ing 	 	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	out	.
and	then	,	on	the	other	side	of	the	room	,	the	 design 	 ers 	 	are	making	small	 adjust 	 ments 	 	,	 sketch 	 ing 	 	,	 draw 	 ing 	 	by	hand	,	 put 	 ting 	 	it	in	the	computer	.
and	it	's	what	i	call	 be 	 ing 	 	design	driven	.
you	know	,	there	is	some	push	and	pull	,	but	design	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	define	the	whole	experience	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	out	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	design	is	never	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	the	other	new	way	that	is	 un 	 ique 	 	in	how	we	work	is	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	never	 d 	 one 	 	,	you	have	to	do	all	 th 	 is 	 	other	stuff	.
the	 pack 	 aging 	 	,	and	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	you	need	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	touch	the	user	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
but	how	do	you	retain	 some 	 body 	 	,	when	it	's	never	 d 	 one 	 	?
and	hosain	rahman	,	the	ceo	of	aliph	jawbone	,	you	know	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	that	you	need	a	different	structure	.
so	,	in	a	way	,	the	different	structure	is	that	we	're	 partner 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	.	we	can	 continu 	 e 	 	to	work	and	dedicate	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	and	then	we	 al 	 so 	 	share	in	the	 reward 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	project	,	 an 	 other 	 	 partner 	 ship 	 	-	type	approach	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	y	water	,	and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	guy	from	los	angeles	,	thomas	arndt	,	austrian	 original 	 ly 	 	,	who	came	to	us	,	and	all	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	to	create	a	 health 	 y 	 	drink	,	or	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	drink	for	his	 kid 	 s 	 	,	to	replace	the	high	-	sugar	-	content	 soda 	 s 	 	that	he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	them	away	from	.
so	,	we	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	bottle	,	and	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	in	every	dimension	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	the	bottle	to	turn	 in 	 to 	 	a	game	.
the	 bottle 	 s 	 	connect	together	,	and	you	can	create	different	 shape 	 s 	 	,	different	 form 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
and	then	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	shape	of	the	bottle	 up 	 side 	 	down	 re 	 minded 	 	us	of	a	y	,	and	then	we	thought	,	well	these	 word 	 s 	 	,	``	why	``	and	``	why	not	,	``	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 word 	 s 	 	that	 kid 	 s 	 	ask	.
so	we	 call 	 ed 	 	it	y	water	.	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	place	where	it	all	 come 	 s 	 	together	in	the	same	room	:	the	three	-	dimensional	design	,	the	 idea 	 s 	 	,	the	 brand 	 ing 	 	,	it	all	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	the	other	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	,	we	 br 	 ing 	 	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	we	 br 	 ing 	 	a	 market 	 ing 	 	approach	,	we	 br 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	but	i	think	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	what	we	 br 	 ing 	 	is	these	 value 	 s 	 	,	and	these	 value 	 s 	 	create	a	soul	for	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	we	work	with	.
and	it	's	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 reward 	 ing 	 	when	your	design	work	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	creative	endeavor	,	when	 other 	 s 	 	can	be	creative	and	do	more	with	it	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	project	,	which	i	think	 re 	 ally 	 	 emul 	 ates 	 	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	,	the	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.
in	nigeria	,	people	carry	 the 	 ir 	 	most	precious	 belong 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	girl	is	going	to	school	with	a	 lap 	 top 	 	on	her	head	.
i	mean	,	to	me	,	it	just	 mean 	 s 	 	so	much	.
but	when	nicholas	negroponte	--	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	spoken	about	 th 	 is 	 	project	a	lot	,	he	's	the	founder	of	olpc	--	came	to	us	about	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	some	clear	 idea 	 s 	 	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	education	and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	technology	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 pillar 	 s 	 	of	his	life	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 pillar 	 s 	 	of	the	mission	of	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	.
but	the	third	pillar	that	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	was	design	.
and	at	the	time	,	i	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 computer 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	,	from	the	previous	adventure	.
but	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	significant	,	is	that	design	was	going	to	be	why	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	love	 th 	 is 	 	product	,	how	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	make	it	low	cost	,	 ro 	 bust 	 	.
and	plus	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	was	going	to	get	rid	of	the	 cap 	 s 	 	lock	key	--	--	and	the	num	lock	key	,	too	.
so	,	i	was	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	.	we	designed	it	to	be	 icon 	 ic 	 	,	to	look	different	.	to	look	like	it	's	for	a	kid	,	but	not	like	a	 to 	 y 	 	.
and	then	the	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	all	these	great	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	which	you	've	heard	about	,	the	wi	-	fi	 antenna 	 s 	 	that	allow	the	 kid 	 s 	 	to	connect	;	the	screen	,	which	you	can	read	in	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	;	the	 key 	 board 	 	,	which	is	made	out	of	rubber	,	and	it	's	 protect 	 ed 	 	from	the	environment	.
you	know	,	all	these	great	 techno 	 logies 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	the	olpc	people	and	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	.
they	 f 	 ought 	 	the	 suppli 	 ers 	 	,	they	 f 	 ought 	 	the	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	.
i	mean	,	they	 f 	 ought 	 	like	 animal 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	to	remain	they	way	it	is	.
and	in	a	way	,	it	is	that	will	that	 make 	 s 	 	 project 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	--	 allow 	 s 	 	the	process	from	not	 destroy 	 ing 	 	the	original	idea	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
so	,	now	you	get	these	 picture 	 s 	 	--	you	get	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	see	the	 kid 	 s 	 	in	nigeria	and	you	see	them	in	uruguay	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	in	mongolia	.
and	we	went	away	from	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	 be 	 ige 	 	.
i	mean	it	's	 color 	 ful 	 	,	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.
in	fact	,	you	can	see	each	logo	is	a	little	bit	different	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	run	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	process	,	20	 color 	 s 	 	for	the	x	and	the	o	,	which	is	the	name	of	the	computer	,	and	by	 mix 	 ing 	 	them	on	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	floor	,	you	get	20	 time 	 s 	 	20	:	you	get	400	different	 option 	 s 	 	there	.
so	,	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	from	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 kid 	 s 	 	using	them	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	are	 in 	 credible 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	nephew	,	anthony	,	in	switzerland	,	and	he	had	the	 lap 	 top 	 	for	an	afternoon	,	and	i	had	to	take	it	back	.	it	was	hard	.
and	it	was	a	prototype	.	and	a	month	and	a	half	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	come	back	to	switzerland	,	and	there	he	is	 play 	 ing 	 	with	his	own	version	.
like	paper	,	paper	and	 card 	 board 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	finish	with	one	last	project	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	bit	more	of	adult	play	.
some	of	you	might	have	heard	about	the	new	york	city	condom	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 launch 	 ed 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	on	 valent 	 ine 	 	's	day	,	february	14	,	about	10	 day 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	,	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	health	in	new	york	came	to	us	,	and	they	 need 	 ed 	 	a	way	to	 distribut 	 e 	 	36	million	 condom 	 s 	 	for	free	to	the	 citizen 	 s 	 	of	new	york	.
so	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	endeavor	,	and	we	 work 	 ed 	 	on	the	 dispens 	 ers 	 	.
these	are	the	 dispens 	 ers 	 	.	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	friendly	shape	.
it	's	a	little	bit	like	 design 	 ing 	 	a	fire	hydrant	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 eas 	 ily 	 	 service 	 able 	 	:	you	have	to	know	where	it	is	and	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	designed	the	 condom 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	i	was	just	in	new	york	at	the	launch	,	and	i	went	to	see	all	these	 place 	 s 	 	where	they	're	 install 	 ed 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	at	a	puerto	rican	little	mom	-	and	-	pop	store	;	at	a	bar	in	christopher	street	;	at	a	pool	hall	.
i	mean	,	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 install 	 ed 	 	in	 home 	 less 	 	 clinic 	 s 	 	--	 every 	 where 	 	.
of	course	,	 club 	 s 	 	and	 dis 	 co 	 s 	 	,	too	.
and	here	's	the	public	service	 announce 	 ment 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
get	some	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	where	design	is	able	to	create	a	conversation	.
i	was	in	these	 venue 	 s 	 	,	and	people	 we 	 re 	 	,	you	know	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	them	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	 break 	 ing 	 	the	ice	,	it	was	 get 	 ting 	 	over	a	stigma	,	and	i	think	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	what	design	can	do	.
so	,	i	was	going	to	throw	some	 condom 	 s 	 	in	the	room	and	 what 	 not 	 	,	but	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	it	's	the	 et 	 ique 	 tte 	 	here	.
 yea 	 h 	 	?	all	right	,	all	right	.	i	have	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	.
so	,	i	have	more	,	you	can	 al 	 ways 	 	ask	me	for	some	more	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	if	 any 	 body 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	why	you	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	condom	,	you	can	just	say	you	like	the	design	.
so	,	i	'll	finish	with	just	one	thought	:	if	we	all	work	together	on	creating	value	,	but	if	we	 re 	 ally 	 	keep	in	mind	the	 value 	 s 	 	of	the	work	that	we	do	,	i	think	we	can	change	the	work	that	we	do	.
we	can	change	these	 value 	 s 	 	,	can	change	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	we	work	with	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	together	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	change	the	world	.
so	,	thank	you	.
