and	making	sense	of	the	financial	crisis	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	.

it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	he	can	 re 	 late 	 	to	.
and	the	other	one	,	of	course	,	is	donald	rumsfeld	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	are	the	known	knowns	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	know	we	know	.

and	then	,	you	're	now	,	well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	,	what	ben	bernanke	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	chaotic	unwinding	of	the	world	's	financial	system	,	it	's	about	--	they	do	n't	know	,	they	did	n't	know	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
in	2006	,	the	head	of	the	american	mortgage	 bank 	 ers 	 	 associ 	 ation 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	quote	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	 clear 	 ly 	 	see	,	no	 s 	 e 	 ism 	 ic 	 	 occur 	 rence 	 	is	about	to	overwhelm	the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.	``
