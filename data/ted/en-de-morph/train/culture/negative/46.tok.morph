thank	you	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
like	the	speaker	before	me	,	i	am	--	that	's	the	ted	virgin	,	i	guess	--	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	the	first	time	here	,	and	i	do	n't	know	what	to	say	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	that	mr.	anderson	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	that	i	get	a	chance	to	play	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
and	the	song	that	i	just	 play 	 ed 	 	was	by	j√≥zef	hofmann	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 kale 	 ido 	 scope 	 	.	``
and	hofmann	is	a	polish	pianist	and	 compose 	 r 	 	of	the	late	19th	century	,	and	he	's	 wide 	 ly 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 pianist 	 s 	 	of	all	time	.
i	have	 an 	 other 	 	piece	that	i	'd	like	to	play	for	you	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	abegg	 vari 	 ations 	 	,	``	by	robert	schumann	,	a	german	19th	century	 compose 	 r 	 	.
the	name	``	abegg	``	--	``	abegg	``	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	-	b	-	e	-	g	-	g	,	and	that	's	the	main	theme	in	the	 melo 	 dy 	 	.
that	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	last	name	of	one	of	schumann	's	female	 friend 	 s 	 	.
but	he	wrote	that	for	his	wife	.
so	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	listen	 care 	 fully 	 	,	there	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	five	 vari 	 ations 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	abegg	theme	.
it	's	written	around	1834	,	so	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	old	,	i	hope	you	like	it	.
now	 come 	 s 	 	the	part	that	i	hate	.
well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	mr.	anderson	told	me	that	 th 	 is 	 	session	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	sync	and	flow	,	``	i	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	do	i	know	that	these	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	do	n't	?	``
so	,	i	'll	talk	about	musical	 com 	 position 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	do	n't	know	where	to	start	.
how	do	i	compose	?
i	think	yamaha	 do 	 es 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	job	of	 teach 	 ing 	 	us	how	to	compose	.
what	i	do	first	is	,	i	make	a	lot	of	little	musical	 idea 	 s 	 	--	you	can	just	 improv 	 ise 	 	here	at	the	piano	--	and	i	 choos 	 e 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	my	main	theme	,	my	main	 melo 	 dy 	 	,	like	the	abegg	that	you	just	heard	.
and	once	i	 choos 	 e 	 	my	main	theme	i	have	to	decide	,	out	of	all	the	 style 	 s 	 	in	music	,	what	kind	of	style	do	i	want	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	year	i	 compose 	 d 	 	a	romantic	style	.
so	,	for	inspiration	i	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	liszt	and	tchaikovsky	and	all	the	great	romantic	 compose 	 rs 	 	.
next	,	i	make	the	structure	of	the	entire	piece	with	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
they	help	me	plan	out	the	whole	piece	,	and	then	the	hard	part	is	 fill 	 ing 	 	it	in	with	musical	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	you	have	to	think	.
and	then	,	when	the	piece	 take 	 s 	 	 some 	 what 	 	of	a	 s 	 ol 	 ified 	 	form	--	 solid 	 ified 	 	,	excuse	me	--	 solid 	 ified 	 	form	,	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	polish	the	piece	,	polish	the	 detail 	 s 	 	,	and	then	polish	the	 over 	 all 	 	performance	of	the	 com 	 position 	 	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	i	enjoy	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 draw 	 ing 	 	--	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	like	to	draw	,	you	know	,	japanese	 anim 	 e 	 	art	.
i	think	that	's	a	craze	among	 teen 	 s 	 	right	now	.
and	once	i	 real 	 ized 	 	it	,	there	's	a	parallel	between	creating	music	and	creating	art	,	 be 	 cause 	 	for	your	motive	or	your	little	 initi 	 al 	 	idea	for	your	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	your	character	--	you	want	to	decide	who	do	you	want	to	draw	,	or	if	you	want	to	draw	an	original	character	.
and	then	you	want	to	decide	,	how	are	you	going	to	draw	the	character	?
like	,	am	i	going	to	use	one	page	?
am	i	going	to	draw	it	on	the	computer	?
am	i	going	to	use	a	two	-	page	spread	like	a	 com 	 ic 	 	book	for	more	 grand 	 iose 	 	effect	,	i	guess	?
and	then	you	have	to	do	the	 initi 	 al 	 	sketch	of	the	character	,	which	is	like	your	structure	of	a	piece	,	and	then	you	add	pen	and	pencil	and	 what 	 ever 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	that	you	need	--	that	's	 polish 	 ing 	 	the	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	both	of	these	have	in	common	is	your	state	of	mind	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	--	i	'm	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	 distract 	 ed 	 	,	so	if	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 home 	 work 	 	,	if	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 home 	 work 	 	and	i	do	n't	feel	like	it	,	i	'll	try	to	draw	or	,	you	know	,	waste	my	time	.
and	then	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	 absolute 	 ly 	 	ca	n't	draw	or	i	ca	n't	compose	at	all	,	and	then	it	's	like	there	's	too	much	on	your	mind	.
you	ca	n't	focus	on	what	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	if	you	manage	to	use	your	time	 wise 	 ly 	 	and	work	on	it	,	you	'll	get	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	it	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	 natural 	 ly 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	if	 some 	 thing 	 	 magic 	 al 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	if	 some 	 thing 	 	natural	 happen 	 s 	 	to	you	,	you	're	able	to	produce	all	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	stuff	 instant 	 ly 	 	,	and	then	that	's	what	i	consider	``	flow	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	when	 every 	 thing 	 	 click 	 s 	 	and	you	're	able	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
you	feel	like	you	're	on	top	of	your	game	and	you	can	do	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	.
i	'm	not	going	to	play	my	own	 com 	 position 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	did	finish	it	,	it	's	way	too	long	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	try	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	improvisation	.	``
i	have	here	seven	note	 card 	 s 	 	,	one	with	each	note	of	the	musical	 alpha 	 bet 	 	,	and	i	'd	like	 some 	 one 	 	to	come	up	here	and	 choos 	 e 	 	five	--	 any 	 one 	 	to	come	up	here	and	 choos 	 e 	 	five	--	and	then	i	can	make	it	 in 	 to 	 	some	sort	of	 melo 	 dy 	 	and	i	'll	 improv 	 ise 	 	it	.
 w 	 ow 	 	,	a	volunteer	,	 ya 	 y 	 	!
nice	to	meet	you	.
goldie	hawn	:	thank	you	.	 choos 	 e 	 	five	?
jennifer	lin	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	five	 card 	 s 	 	.	any	five	 card 	 s 	 	.
gh	:	ok	.	one	.	two	.	three	.
oh	,	d	and	f	--	too	familiar	.
jl	:	one	more	.
gh	:	ok	,	e	for	effort	.
jl	:	would	you	mind	 read 	 ing 	 	them	out	in	the	order	that	you	chose	them	?
gh	:	ok	.	c	,	g	,	b	,	a	and	e	.
jl	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
gh	:	you	're	welcome	.	and	what	about	these	?
jl	:	i	wo	n't	use	them	.	thank	you	.
now	,	she	chose	c	,	g	,	b	,	a	,	e	.
i	'm	going	to	try	to	put	that	in	some	sort	of	order	.
ok	,	that	's	nice	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	have	a	moment	to	think	,	and	i	'll	try	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	it	.
the	next	song	,	or	the	 en 	 core 	 	,	that	i	'm	going	to	play	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	bumble	boogie	,	``	by	jack	fina	.
