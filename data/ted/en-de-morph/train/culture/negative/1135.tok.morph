my	name	is	arvind	gupta	,	and	i	'm	a	 to 	 y 	 maker 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	making	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	for	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	early	'70s	,	i	was	in	college	.
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 revolution 	 ary 	 	time	.
it	was	a	 politic 	 al 	 	ferment	,	so	to	say	--	 student 	 s 	 	out	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	paris	,	 revolt 	 ing 	 	against	 author 	 ity 	 	.
america	was	 jol 	 ted 	 	by	the	anti	-	vietnam	 move 	 ment 	 	,	the	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
in	india	,	we	had	the	naxalite	 move 	 ment 	 	,	the	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	 move 	 ment 	 	.
but	you	know	,	when	there	is	a	 politic 	 al 	 	 churn 	 ing 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	it	 unleash 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	energy	.
the	national	 move 	 ment 	 	of	india	was	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	to	that	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	 re 	 sign 	 ed 	 	from	well	-	paid	 job 	 s 	 	and	 jump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	national	 move 	 ment 	 	.
now	in	the	early	'70s	,	one	of	the	great	 program 	 s 	 	in	india	was	to	 re 	 vital 	 ize 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	science	in	village	 school 	 s 	 	.
there	was	a	person	,	anil	sadgopal	,	did	a	ph.d.	from	caltech	and	 return 	 ed 	 	back	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biologist	in	india	's	cutting	-	edge	research	institute	,	the	tifr	.
at	31	,	he	was	not	able	to	 re 	 late 	 	the	kind	of	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	research	,	which	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	with	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	.
so	he	designed	and	went	and	 start 	 ed 	 	a	village	science	program	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	inspired	by	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	slogan	of	the	early	'70s	was	``	go	to	the	people	.
live	with	them	;	love	them	.
start	from	what	they	know	.	build	on	what	they	have	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	kind	of	the	 defi 	 ning 	 	slogan	.
well	i	took	one	year	.
i	 join 	 ed 	 	telco	,	made	tata	 truck 	 s 	 	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	close	to	pune	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	there	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	was	not	born	to	make	 truck 	 s 	 	.
often	one	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	what	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	do	,	but	it	's	good	 en 	 ough 	 	to	know	what	you	do	n't	want	to	do	.
so	i	took	one	year	off	,	and	i	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	village	science	program	.
and	it	was	a	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	.
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	village	--	a	 week 	 ly 	 	bazaar	where	people	,	just	once	in	a	week	,	they	put	in	all	the	 va 	 ts 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	year	over	here	.	``
so	i	just	 b 	 ought 	 	one	specimen	of	 every 	 thing 	 	which	was	 s 	 old 	 	on	the	 road 	 side 	 	.
and	one	thing	which	i	found	was	 th 	 is 	 	black	rubber	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	cycle	 val 	 ve 	 	tube	.
when	you	pump	in	air	in	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	you	use	a	bit	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	some	of	these	 model 	 s 	 	--	so	you	take	a	bit	of	 th 	 is 	 	cycle	 val 	 ve 	 	tube	,	you	can	put	two	 match 	 stick 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	make	a	 flex 	 ible 	 	joint	.
it	's	a	joint	of	 tube 	 s 	 	.	you	start	by	 teach 	 ing 	 	 angle 	 s 	 	--	an	 a 	 cute 	 	angle	,	a	right	angle	,	an	 obt 	 use 	 	angle	,	a	straight	angle	.
it	's	like	 it 	 s 	 	own	little	 coup 	 ling 	 	.
if	you	have	three	of	them	,	and	you	loop	them	together	,	well	you	make	a	triangle	.
with	four	,	you	make	a	square	,	you	make	a	 pent 	 agon 	 	,	you	make	a	hexagon	,	you	make	all	these	kind	of	 polygon 	 s 	 	.
and	they	have	some	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	hexagon	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	it	's	like	an	 amoeb 	 a 	 	,	which	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	changing	 it 	 s 	 	own	profile	.
you	can	just	pull	 th 	 is 	 	out	,	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 rect 	 angle 	 	.
you	give	it	a	push	,	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 parallel 	 ogram 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 sha 	 ky 	 	.
look	at	the	 pent 	 agon 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	pull	 th 	 is 	 	out	--	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	boat	shape	 trap 	 ez 	 ium 	 	.
push	it	and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	house	shaped	.
 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	 isosce 	 les 	 	triangle	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 sha 	 ky 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	square	might	look	 ver 	 y 	 	square	and	prim	.
give	it	a	little	push	--	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 r 	 hom 	 bus 	 	.
it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	kite	-	shaped	.
but	give	a	child	a	triangle	,	he	ca	n't	do	a	thing	to	it	.
why	use	 triangle 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 triangle 	 s 	 	are	the	 on 	 ly 	 	rigid	 structure 	 s 	 	.
we	ca	n't	make	a	bridge	with	 square 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	train	would	come	,	it	would	start	 do 	 ing 	 	a	jig	.
 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	go	to	a	village	in	india	,	they	might	not	have	gone	to	 engineer 	 ing 	 	college	,	but	no	one	 make 	 s 	 	a	roof	 place 	 d 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	they	put	 tile 	 s 	 	on	top	,	it	's	just	going	to	crash	.
they	 al 	 ways 	 	make	a	 tri 	 angular 	 	roof	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	people	science	.
and	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	just	poke	a	hole	over	here	and	put	a	third	 match 	 stick 	 	,	you	'll	get	a	t	joint	.
and	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	poke	all	the	three	 leg 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	three	 vert 	 ice 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	triangle	,	i	would	make	a	tetrahedron	.
so	you	make	all	these	3d	 shape 	 s 	 	.
you	make	a	tetrahedron	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	once	you	make	these	,	you	make	a	little	house	.
put	 th 	 is 	 	on	top	.
you	can	make	a	joint	of	four	.	you	can	make	a	joint	of	six	.
you	just	need	a	ton	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	was	--	you	make	a	joint	of	six	,	you	make	an	icosahedron	.
you	can	play	around	with	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	an	 ig 	 loo 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	1978	.
i	was	a	24	-	year	-	old	young	engineer	.
and	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	so	much	better	than	making	 truck 	 s 	 	.
if	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	put	four	 mar 	 ble 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	you	 simul 	 ate 	 	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	structure	of	 m 	 ethane 	 	,	ch	4	.
four	 atom 	 s 	 	of	hydrogen	,	the	four	 point 	 s 	 	of	the	tetrahedron	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	the	little	carbon	atom	.
well	since	then	,	i	just	thought	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	go	to	over	2,000	 school 	 s 	 	in	my	country	--	village	 school 	 s 	 	,	government	 school 	 s 	 	,	municipal	 school 	 s 	 	,	 iv 	 y 	 	league	 school 	 s 	 	--	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	by	most	of	them	.
and	every	time	i	go	to	a	school	,	i	see	a	gleam	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	the	children	.
i	see	hope	.	i	see	happiness	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
children	want	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.	children	want	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	make	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 pump 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	pump	with	which	you	could	 infla 	 te 	 	a	balloon	.
it	's	a	real	pump	.	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	pop	the	balloon	.
and	we	have	a	slogan	that	the	best	thing	a	child	can	do	with	a	 to 	 y 	 	is	to	break	it	.
so	all	you	do	is	--	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	kind	of	 pro 	 voc 	 ative 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	old	 bi 	 cycle 	 	tube	and	 th 	 is 	 	old	plastic	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	 th 	 is 	 	 fill 	 ing 	 	cap	will	go	 ver 	 y 	 	 snug 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	old	 bi 	 cycle 	 	tube	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	make	a	 val 	 ve 	 	.
you	put	a	little	 stick 	 y 	 	tape	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	-	way	traffic	.
well	we	make	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 pump 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	other	one	--	that	you	just	take	a	straw	,	and	you	just	put	a	stick	 in 	 side 	 	and	you	make	two	half	-	 cut 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	do	,	is	you	bend	both	these	 leg 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	triangle	,	and	you	just	wrap	some	tape	around	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	pump	.
and	now	,	if	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	pump	,	it	's	like	a	great	,	great	 sprinkl 	 er 	 	.
it	's	like	a	 cent 	 rifuge 	 	.
if	you	spin	 some 	 thing 	 	,	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	fly	out	.
well	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	--	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	andhra	pradesh	,	you	would	make	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	 palm 	 yra 	 	leaf	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	our	folk	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	have	great	science	 principle 	 s 	 	.
if	you	spin	-	top	 some 	 thing 	 	,	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	fly	out	.
if	i	do	it	with	both	 hand 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 f 	 un 	 	mr.	 fly 	 ing 	 	man	.
right	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 to 	 y 	 	which	is	made	from	paper	.	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
there	are	four	 picture 	 s 	 	.
you	see	 insect 	 s 	 	,	you	see	 frog 	 s 	 	,	 snake 	 s 	 	,	 eagle 	 s 	 	,	 butter 	 flies 	 	,	 frog 	 s 	 	,	 snake 	 s 	 	,	 eagle 	 s 	 	.
here	's	a	paper	which	you	could	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	--	designed	by	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	at	harvard	in	1928	,	arthur	stone	,	 document 	 ed 	 	by	martin	gardner	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	his	 man 	 y 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	 f 	 un 	 	for	children	.
they	all	 stud 	 y 	 	about	the	food	chain	.
the	 insect 	 s 	 	are	eaten	by	the	 frog 	 s 	 	;	the	 frog 	 s 	 	are	eaten	by	the	 snake 	 s 	 	;	the	 snake 	 s 	 	are	eaten	by	the	 eagle 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	,	if	you	had	a	whole	 photo 	 copy 	 	paper	--	a	4	 s 	 ize 	 	paper	--	you	could	be	in	a	municipal	school	,	you	could	be	in	a	government	school	--	a	paper	,	a	scale	and	a	pencil	--	no	glue	,	no	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	.
in	three	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	just	fold	 th 	 is 	 	up	.
and	what	you	could	use	it	for	is	just	 limit 	 ed 	 	by	your	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
if	you	take	a	 small 	 er 	 	paper	,	you	make	a	 small 	 er 	 	 flex 	 agon 	 	.
with	a	 big 	 ger 	 	one	,	you	make	a	 big 	 ger 	 	one	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	pencil	with	a	few	 s 	 lot 	 s 	 	over	here	.
and	you	put	a	little	fan	here	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	hundred	-	year	-	old	 to 	 y 	 	.
there	have	 be 	 en 	 	six	major	research	 paper 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	's	some	 groove 	 s 	 	over	here	,	you	can	see	.
and	if	i	take	a	 re 	 ed 	 	--	if	i	rub	 th 	 is 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
six	major	research	 paper 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	feynman	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	.
he	wrote	a	paper	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	you	do	n't	need	the	three	billion	-	dollar	hadron	collider	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	there	for	every	child	,	and	every	child	can	enjoy	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	you	want	to	put	a	 color 	 ed 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	,	well	all	these	seven	 color 	 s 	 	coalesce	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	newton	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	400	 year 	 s 	 	back	,	that	white	light	's	made	of	seven	 color 	 s 	 	,	just	by	 s 	 pinning 	 	 th 	 is 	 	around	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	straw	.
what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	we	've	just	 seal 	 ed 	 	both	the	 end 	 s 	 	with	tape	,	 ni 	 pped 	 	the	right	corner	and	the	bottom	left	corner	,	so	there	's	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 corner 	 s 	 	,	there	's	a	little	hole	over	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kind	of	a	 blow 	 ing 	 	straw	.
i	just	put	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	's	a	hole	here	,	and	i	shut	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	money	to	make	--	great	 f 	 un 	 	for	children	to	do	.
what	we	do	is	make	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	electric	motor	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	motor	on	earth	.
the	most	expensive	thing	is	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	you	have	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	it	 cost 	 s 	 	five	 cent 	 s 	 	to	make	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	old	 bi 	 cycle 	 	tube	,	which	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	broad	rubber	band	,	two	 safe 	 ty 	 	 pin 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	permanent	magnet	.
 when 	 ever 	 	current	 flow 	 s 	 	through	the	coil	,	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	 electro 	 magnet 	 	.
it	's	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	of	both	these	 magnet 	 s 	 	which	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	motor	spin	.
we	made	30,000	.
 teacher 	 s 	 	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	science	for	 don 	 key 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	just	muck	up	the	definition	and	they	 s 	 pit 	 	it	out	.
when	 teacher 	 s 	 	make	it	,	children	make	it	.
you	can	see	a	gleam	in	 the 	 ir 	 	eye	.
they	get	a	thrill	of	what	science	is	all	about	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	science	is	not	a	rich	man	's	game	.
in	a	 democrat 	 ic 	 	country	,	science	must	reach	to	our	most	 oppress 	 ed 	 	,	to	the	most	 marginal 	 ized 	 	children	.
 th 	 is 	 	program	 start 	 ed 	 	with	16	 school 	 s 	 	and	spread	to	1,500	government	 school 	 s 	 	.
over	100,000	children	learn	science	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
and	we	're	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	see	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
look	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 tetra 	 pa 	 k 	 	--	awful	 material 	 s 	 	from	the	point	of	view	of	the	environment	.
there	are	six	 layer 	 s 	 	--	three	 layer 	 s 	 	of	plastic	,	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	--	which	are	are	 seal 	 ed 	 	together	.
they	are	fused	together	,	so	you	ca	n't	 separat 	 e 	 	them	.
now	you	can	just	make	a	little	network	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	fold	them	and	stick	them	together	and	make	an	icosahedron	.
so	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	trash	,	which	is	 cho 	 king 	 	all	the	 sea 	 bird 	 s 	 	,	you	could	just	 re 	 cycle 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 joy 	 ous 	 	--	all	the	 plat 	 on 	 ic 	 	 solid 	 s 	 	can	be	made	with	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	straw	,	and	what	you	do	is	you	just	 n 	 ip 	 	two	 corner 	 s 	 	here	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	like	a	baby	crocodile	's	mouth	.
you	put	 th 	 is 	 	in	your	mouth	,	and	you	blow	.
it	's	children	's	 de 	 light 	 	,	a	teacher	's	 en 	 vy 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	say	.
you	're	not	able	to	see	how	the	sound	is	 produce 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	thing	which	is	 vib 	 rating 	 	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 side 	 	my	mouth	.
i	'm	going	to	keep	 th 	 is 	 	 out 	 side 	 	,	to	blow	out	.	i	'm	going	to	suck	in	air	.
so	no	one	 actual 	 ly 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	muck	up	the	production	of	sound	with	wire	 vibration 	 s 	 	.
the	other	is	that	you	keep	 blow 	 ing 	 	at	it	,	keep	making	the	sound	,	and	you	keep	cutting	it	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	when	you	get	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	one	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	 kid 	 s 	 	teach	you	.	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
well	before	i	go	any	further	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	worth	sharing	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 touch 	 ing 	 	 s 	 late 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	for	blind	children	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 strip 	 s 	 	of	velcro	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 draw 	 ing 	 	 s 	 late 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 draw 	 ing 	 	pen	,	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	film	box	.
it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	like	a	 fish 	 er 	 man 	 	's	line	,	a	 fish 	 ing 	 	line	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	wool	over	here	.
if	i	crank	the	handle	,	all	the	wool	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
and	what	a	blind	child	can	do	is	to	just	draw	 th 	 is 	 	.
wool	 stick 	 s 	 	on	velcro	.
there	are	12	million	blind	children	in	our	country	--	who	live	in	a	world	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	 a 	 s 	 	a	great	 bo 	 on 	 	to	them	.
there	's	a	 factor 	 y 	 	out	there	making	our	children	blind	,	not	able	to	provide	them	with	food	,	not	able	to	provide	them	with	 vita 	 min 	 	a	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	 a 	 s 	 	a	great	 bo 	 on 	 	for	them	.
there	are	no	 patent 	 s 	 	.	 any 	 one 	 	can	make	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
you	can	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 gene 	 rator 	 	.	it	's	a	crank	 gene 	 rator 	 	.
these	are	two	 magnet 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	large	 pul 	 ley 	 	made	by	 sandwich 	 ing 	 	rubber	between	two	old	cds	.
small	 pul 	 ley 	 	and	two	strong	 magnet 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	fiber	 turn 	 s 	 	a	wire	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	an	led	.
if	i	spin	 th 	 is 	 	 pul 	 ley 	 	,	the	small	one	's	going	to	spin	much	 fast 	 er 	 	.
there	will	be	a	 s 	 pinning 	 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	.
lines	,	of	course	,	would	be	cut	,	the	force	will	be	generated	.
and	you	can	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	led	is	going	to	glow	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	small	crank	 gene 	 rator 	 	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	just	a	ring	,	a	steel	ring	with	steel	nuts	.
and	what	you	can	do	is	just	,	if	you	give	it	a	twirl	,	well	they	just	keep	going	on	.
and	imagine	a	bunch	of	 kid 	 s 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	a	circle	and	just	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	steel	ring	to	be	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	.
and	they	'd	be	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 joy 	 ous 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
well	in	the	end	,	what	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	:	we	use	a	lot	of	old	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	to	make	 cap 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	worthy	of	sachin	tendulkar	.
it	's	a	great	cricket	cap	.
when	first	you	see	nehru	and	gandhi	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	nehru	cap	--	just	half	a	 news 	 paper 	 	.
we	make	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	with	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	them	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	you	can	see	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	flapping	bird	.
all	of	our	old	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	we	cut	them	 in 	 to 	 	little	 square 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	have	one	of	these	 bird 	 s 	 	--	children	in	japan	have	 be 	 en 	 	making	 th 	 is 	 	bird	for	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	 fan 	 tail 	 	bird	.
well	in	the	end	,	i	'll	just	end	with	a	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	's	hat	story	.	``
the	 cap 	 tain 	 	was	a	 cap 	 tain 	 	of	a	sea	-	going	ship	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 passenger 	 s 	 	on	the	ship	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	,	so	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	them	on	the	deck	.
``	wear	all	your	 color 	 ful 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ing 	 	and	dance	,	and	i	'll	provide	you	with	good	food	and	 drink 	 s 	 	.	``
and	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	would	wear	a	cap	 every 	 day 	 	and	join	in	the	 re 	 gal 	 ia 	 	.
the	first	day	,	it	was	a	huge	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	cap	,	like	a	 cap 	 tain 	 	's	cap	.
that	night	,	when	the	 passenger 	 s 	 	would	be	 sleep 	 ing 	 	,	he	would	give	it	one	more	fold	,	and	the	second	day	,	he	would	be	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	 fire 	 man 	 	's	cap	--	with	a	little	shoot	just	like	a	 design 	 er 	 	cap	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 protect 	 s 	 	the	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	.
and	the	second	night	,	he	would	take	the	same	cap	and	give	it	 an 	 other 	 	fold	.
and	the	third	day	,	it	would	be	a	shikari	cap	--	just	like	an	 adventure 	 r 	 	's	cap	.
and	the	third	night	,	he	would	give	it	two	more	 fold 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	cap	.
if	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	any	of	our	bollywood	 film 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	 police 	 man 	 	 wear 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 za 	 palu 	 	cap	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 catapult 	 ed 	 	to	 inter 	 national 	 	 glor 	 y 	 	.
and	we	must	not	forget	that	he	was	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	of	the	ship	.
so	that	's	a	ship	.
and	now	the	end	:	 every 	 one 	 	was	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	journey	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	and	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	there	was	a	storm	and	huge	 wave 	 s 	 	.
and	all	the	ship	can	do	is	to	dance	and	pitch	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	 wave 	 s 	 	.
a	huge	wave	 come 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 lap 	 s 	 	the	front	and	 knock 	 s 	 	it	down	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	one	 come 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 lap 	 s 	 	the	aft	and	 knock 	 s 	 	it	down	.
and	there	's	a	third	one	over	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	 swallow 	 s 	 	the	bridge	and	 knock 	 s 	 	it	down	.
and	the	ship	 sink 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	lost	 every 	 thing 	 	,	but	for	a	life	jacket	.
thank	you	so	much	.
