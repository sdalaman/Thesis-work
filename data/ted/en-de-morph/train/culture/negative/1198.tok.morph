i	'm	going	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	about	the	 pleasure 	 s 	 	of	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
but	i	want	to	begin	with	a	story	of	an	 un 	 usual 	 	and	 terr 	 ible 	 	man	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	hermann	goering	.
goering	was	hitler	's	second	in	command	in	world	war	ii	,	his	 design 	 ated 	 	 success 	 or 	 	.
and	like	hitler	,	goering	 fanci 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	a	 collect 	 or 	 	of	art	.
he	went	through	europe	,	through	world	war	ii	,	 steal 	 ing 	 	,	 ex 	 tort 	 ing 	 	and	 occasion 	 ally 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	for	his	 collect 	 ion 	 	.
and	what	he	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	by	vermeer	.
hitler	had	two	of	them	,	and	he	did	n't	have	any	.
so	he	 final 	 ly 	 	found	an	art	 deal 	 er 	 	,	a	dutch	art	 deal 	 er 	 	named	han	van	meegeren	,	who	 s 	 old 	 	him	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	vermeer	for	the	cost	of	what	would	now	be	10	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	his	 favor 	 ite 	 	 art 	 work 	 	ever	.
world	war	ii	came	to	an	end	,	and	goering	was	 capture 	 d 	 	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	at	nuremberg	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 sentence 	 d 	 	to	death	.
then	the	 all 	 ied 	 	 force 	 s 	 	went	through	his	 collect 	 ions 	 	and	found	the	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	went	after	the	people	who	 s 	 old 	 	it	to	him	.
and	at	some	point	the	dutch	police	came	 in 	 to 	 	amsterdam	and	 arrest 	 ed 	 	van	meegeren	.
van	meegeren	was	charged	with	the	crime	of	 t 	 reason 	 	,	which	is	 it 	 self 	 	 punish 	 able 	 	by	death	.
six	 week 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	 pri 	 son 	 	sentence	,	van	meegeren	 confess 	 ed 	 	.
but	he	did	n't	confess	to	 t 	 reason 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	did	not	sell	a	great	 master 	 piece 	 	to	that	nazi	.
i	 paint 	 ed 	 	it	 my 	 self 	 	;	i	'm	a	forger	.	``
now	 no 	 body 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	him	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	prove	it	.
 br 	 ing 	 	me	a	canvas	and	some	paint	,	and	i	will	paint	a	vermeer	much	better	than	i	 s 	 old 	 	that	 disgust 	 ing 	 	nazi	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	need	alcohol	and	 morph 	 ine 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	i	can	work	.	``
so	they	 br 	 ought 	 	him	in	.
he	 paint 	 ed 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	vermeer	.
and	then	the	 charge 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 reason 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	.
he	had	a	 less 	 er 	 	charge	of	 forger 	 y 	 	,	got	a	year	sentence	and	 di 	 ed 	 	a	hero	to	the	dutch	people	.
there	's	a	lot	more	to	be	 s 	 aid 	 	about	van	meegeren	,	but	i	want	to	turn	now	to	goering	,	who	's	 picture 	 d 	 	here	 be 	 ing 	 	 interrog 	 ated 	 	at	nuremberg	.
now	goering	was	,	by	all	 account 	 s 	 	,	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	man	.
even	for	a	nazi	,	he	was	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	man	.
his	american	 interrog 	 ators 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	him	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ami 	 cable 	 	psychopath	.
but	you	could	feel	 sympath 	 y 	 	for	the	 re 	 action 	 	he	had	when	he	was	told	that	his	 favor 	 ite 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 forger 	 y 	 	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	his	 bi 	 ographer 	 	,	``	he	 look 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	for	the	first	time	he	had	 discover 	 ed 	 	there	was	 e 	 vil 	 	in	the	world	.	``
and	he	 kill 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	soon	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
he	had	 discover 	 ed 	 	after	all	that	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	he	thought	was	 th 	 is 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	.
it	 look 	 ed 	 	the	same	,	but	it	had	a	different	origin	,	it	was	a	different	 art 	 work 	 	.
it	was	n't	just	him	who	was	in	for	a	shock	.
once	van	meegeren	was	on	trial	,	he	could	n't	stop	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
and	he	 boast 	 ed 	 	about	all	the	great	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	that	he	 him 	 self 	 	had	 paint 	 ed 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 attribut 	 ed 	 	to	other	 artist 	 s 	 	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	``	the	 s 	 upper 	 	at	emmaus	``	which	was	 view 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	vermeer	's	 fin 	 est 	 	 master 	 piece 	 	,	his	best	work	--	people	would	come	[	from	]	all	over	the	world	to	see	it	--	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 forger 	 y 	 	.
it	was	not	that	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	but	that	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
and	when	that	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	it	lost	all	 it 	 s 	 	value	and	was	taken	away	from	the	museum	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	matter	?
i	'm	a	 psycho 	 logists 	 	--	why	do	 origin 	 s 	 	matter	so	much	?
why	do	we	respond	so	much	to	our	knowledge	of	where	 some 	 thing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	?
well	there	's	an	answer	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	would	give	.
 man 	 y 	 	 socio 	 logists 	 	like	veblen	and	wolfe	would	 argu 	 e 	 	that	the	reason	why	we	take	 origin 	 s 	 	so	 serious 	 ly 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 snob 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	focused	on	 stat 	 us 	 	.
among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	if	you	want	to	show	off	how	rich	you	are	,	how	 power 	 ful 	 	you	are	,	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	better	to	own	an	original	than	a	 forger 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	be	 few 	 er 	 	 original 	 s 	 	than	 forger 	 ies 	 	.
i	do	n't	doubt	that	that	 play 	 s 	 	some	role	,	but	what	i	want	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	of	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	going	on	.
i	want	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	 human 	 s 	 	are	,	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	natural	born	 essential 	 ists 	 	.
what	i	mean	by	 th 	 is 	 	is	we	do	n't	just	respond	to	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	them	,	or	feel	them	,	or	hear	them	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	our	 respons 	 e 	 	is	 condition 	 ed 	 	on	our	 belief 	 s 	 	,	about	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	,	what	they	came	from	,	what	they	're	made	of	,	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	nature	is	.
i	want	to	suggest	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	,	not	just	for	how	we	think	about	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	how	we	react	to	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	i	want	to	suggest	that	pleasure	is	deep	--	and	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	true	just	for	 high 	 er 	 	level	 pleasure 	 s 	 	like	art	,	but	even	the	most	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	simple	 pleasure 	 s 	 	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	our	 belief 	 s 	 	about	 hid 	 den 	 	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
so	take	food	.
would	you	eat	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	a	good	answer	is	,	``	it	 depend 	 s 	 	.	what	is	it	?	``
some	of	you	would	eat	it	if	it	's	pork	,	but	not	beef	.
some	of	you	would	eat	it	if	it	's	beef	,	but	not	pork	.
few	of	you	would	eat	it	if	it	's	a	rat	or	a	human	.
some	of	you	would	eat	it	 on 	 ly 	 	if	it	's	a	 strange 	 ly 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	piece	of	 to 	 fu 	 	.
that	's	not	so	surprising	.
but	what	's	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	how	it	 taste 	 s 	 	to	you	will	depend	 critical 	 ly 	 	on	what	you	think	you	're	eating	.
so	one	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	with	young	children	.
how	do	you	make	children	not	just	be	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	eat	 carrot 	 s 	 	and	drink	milk	,	but	to	get	more	pleasure	from	eating	 carrot 	 s 	 	and	 drink 	 ing 	 	milk	--	to	think	they	taste	better	?
it	's	simple	,	you	tell	them	they	're	from	mcdonald	's	.
they	 believ 	 e 	 	mcdonald	's	food	is	 ta 	 s 	 tier 	 	,	and	it	 lead 	 s 	 	them	to	experience	it	 a 	 s 	 	 ta 	 s 	 tier 	 	.
how	do	you	get	 adult 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	enjoy	wine	?
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	:	pour	it	from	an	expensive	bottle	.
there	are	now	 dozen 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	that	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	you	're	 drink 	 ing 	 	the	expensive	stuff	,	it	 taste 	 s 	 	better	to	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	with	a	 neuro 	 scientific 	 	twist	.
they	get	people	 in 	 to 	 	a	fmri	scanner	,	and	while	they	're	 ly 	 ing 	 	there	,	through	a	tube	,	they	get	to	 s 	 ip 	 	wine	.
in	front	of	them	on	a	screen	is	information	about	the	wine	.
 every 	 body 	 	,	of	course	,	 drink 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	wine	.
but	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	you	're	 drink 	 ing 	 	expensive	stuff	,	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	 associate 	 d 	 	with	pleasure	and	reward	light	up	like	a	christmas	tree	.
it	's	not	just	that	you	say	it	's	more	 pleas 	 ur 	 able 	 	,	you	say	you	like	it	more	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	experience	it	in	a	different	way	.
or	take	 s 	 ex 	 	.
these	are	 stimul 	 i 	 	i	've	used	in	some	of	my	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
and	if	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	show	people	these	 picture 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	say	these	are	 fair 	 ly 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	people	.
but	how	 attract 	 ive 	 	you	find	them	,	how	 sexual 	 ly 	 	or	 romantic 	 ally 	 	 move 	 d 	 	you	are	by	them	,	 rest 	 s 	 	 critical 	 ly 	 	on	who	you	think	you	're	looking	at	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	the	picture	on	the	left	is	male	,	the	one	on	the	right	is	female	.
if	that	belief	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 mistak 	 en 	 	,	it	will	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
it	will	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	if	they	turn	out	to	be	much	 young 	 er 	 	or	much	 old 	 er 	 	than	you	think	they	are	.
it	will	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	discover	that	the	person	you	're	looking	at	with	lust	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 dis 	 guise 	 d 	 	version	of	your	son	or	daughter	,	your	mother	or	father	.
 know 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	's	your	kin	 typical 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 s 	 	the	 lib 	 ido 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	one	of	the	most	 heart 	 en 	 ing 	 	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	from	the	 psycho 	 logy 	 	of	pleasure	is	there	's	more	to	looking	good	than	your	physical	 appear 	 ance 	 	.
if	you	like	 some 	 body 	 	,	they	look	better	to	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	 spouse 	 s 	 	in	happy	 marriage 	 s 	 	tend	to	think	that	 the 	 ir 	 	husband	or	wife	 look 	 s 	 	much	better	than	 any 	 one 	 	else	 think 	 s 	 	that	they	do	.
a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	capgras	syndrome	.
so	capgras	syndrome	is	a	 dis 	 order 	 	where	you	get	a	specific	delusion	.
sufferers	of	capgras	syndrome	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	people	they	love	most	in	the	world	have	 be 	 en 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	by	perfect	 duplic 	 ates 	 	.
now	often	,	a	result	of	capgras	syndrome	is	tragic	.
people	have	 murder 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	that	they	 love 	 d 	 	,	 believ 	 ing 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 murder 	 ing 	 	an	 im 	 post 	 er 	 	.
but	there	's	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	case	where	capgras	syndrome	had	a	happy	 end 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 record 	 ed 	 	in	1931	.
``	research	 de 	 scribed 	 	a	woman	with	capgras	syndrome	who	 complain 	 ed 	 	about	her	 poor 	 ly 	 	 endo 	 wed 	 	and	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	lover	.	``
but	that	was	before	she	got	capgras	syndrome	.
after	she	got	it	,	``	she	was	happy	to	report	that	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	he	 possess 	 ed 	 	a	double	who	was	rich	,	 vir 	 ile 	 	,	 hand 	 some 	 	and	 aristoc 	 ratic 	 	.	``
of	course	,	it	was	the	same	man	,	but	she	was	 see 	 ing 	 	him	in	different	ways	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	third	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	consider	consumer	 product 	 s 	 	.
so	one	reason	why	you	might	like	 some 	 thing 	 	is	 it 	 s 	 	 util 	 ity 	 	.
you	can	put	 shoe 	 s 	 	on	your	feet	;	you	can	play	golf	with	golf	 club 	 s 	 	;	and	 chew 	 ed 	 	up	bubble	gum	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	at	all	for	you	.
but	each	of	these	three	 object 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	value	above	and	beyond	what	it	can	do	for	you	based	on	 it 	 s 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
the	golf	 club 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	owned	by	john	f.	kennedy	and	 s 	 old 	 	for	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	a	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	at	auction	.
the	bubble	gum	was	 chew 	 ed 	 	up	by	pop	star	britney	 spear 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 old 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	there	's	a	 thriv 	 ing 	 	market	in	the	 partial 	 ly 	 	eaten	food	of	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	people	.
the	 shoe 	 s 	 	are	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	 valu 	 able 	 	of	all	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	an	 un 	 confirm 	 ed 	 	report	,	a	saudi	millionaire	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	10	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	pair	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	at	george	bush	at	an	iraqi	press	 con 	 ference 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 attract 	 ion 	 	to	 object 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	work	for	 celebr 	 ity 	 	 object 	 s 	 	.
each	one	of	us	,	most	people	,	have	 some 	 thing 	 	in	our	life	that	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	 ir 	 replace 	 able 	 	,	in	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	value	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	your	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	ring	,	 may 	 be 	 	your	child	's	baby	 shoe 	 s 	 	--	so	that	if	it	was	lost	,	you	could	n't	get	it	back	.
you	could	get	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 ed 	 	like	it	or	felt	like	it	,	but	you	could	n't	get	the	same	object	back	.
with	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	george	newman	and	gil	diesendruck	,	we	've	 look 	 ed 	 	to	see	what	sort	of	 factor 	 s 	 	,	what	sort	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	 matter 	 s 	 	for	the	 object 	 s 	 	that	people	like	.
so	in	one	of	our	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	name	a	famous	person	who	they	 ador 	 ed 	 	,	a	living	person	they	 ador 	 ed 	 	.
so	one	answer	was	george	clooney	.
then	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	``	how	much	would	you	pay	for	george	clooney	's	 sweat 	 er 	 	?	``
and	the	answer	is	a	fair	amount	--	more	than	you	would	pay	for	a	brand	new	 sweat 	 er 	 	or	a	 sweat 	 er 	 	owned	by	 some 	 body 	 	who	you	did	n't	 ador 	 e 	 	.
then	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	other	 group 	 s 	 	of	 subject 	 s 	 	--	we	 g 	 ave 	 	them	different	 restrict 	 ions 	 	and	different	 condition 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	we	told	some	people	,	``	look	,	you	can	buy	the	 sweat 	 er 	 	,	but	you	ca	n't	tell	 any 	 body 	 	you	own	it	,	and	you	ca	n't	 re 	 sell 	 	it	.	``
that	 drop 	 s 	 	the	value	of	it	,	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	that	's	one	reason	why	we	like	it	.
but	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	an	effect	is	you	tell	people	,	``	look	,	you	could	 re 	 sell 	 	it	,	you	could	boast	about	it	,	but	before	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	you	,	it	's	 thorough 	 ly 	 	 wash 	 ed 	 	.	``
that	 cause 	 s 	 	a	huge	drop	in	the	value	.
 a 	 s 	 	my	wife	put	it	,	``	you	've	 wash 	 ed 	 	away	the	clooney	 cootie 	 s 	 	.	``
so	let	's	go	back	to	art	.
i	would	love	a	chagall	.	i	love	the	work	of	chagall	.
if	people	want	to	get	me	 some 	 thing 	 	at	the	end	of	the	 con 	 ference 	 	,	you	could	buy	me	a	chagall	.
but	i	do	n't	want	a	 duplic 	 ate 	 	,	even	if	i	ca	n't	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
that	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	,	or	it	's	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	i	'm	a	snob	and	want	to	boast	about	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	original	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	specific	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
in	the	case	of	 art 	 work 	 	,	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	special	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
the	 philosoph 	 er 	 	denis	dutton	in	his	 wonder 	 ful 	 	book	``	the	art	instinct	``	 make 	 s 	 	the	case	that	,	``	the	value	of	an	 art 	 work 	 	is	 root 	 ed 	 	in	 assumption 	 s 	 	about	the	human	performance	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	creation	.	``
and	that	could	explain	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	an	original	and	a	 forger 	 y 	 	.
they	may	look	 a 	 like 	 	,	but	they	have	a	different	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
the	original	is	 typical 	 ly 	 	the	product	of	a	creative	act	,	the	 forger 	 y 	 	is	n't	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	approach	can	explain	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	people	's	taste	in	art	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	work	by	jackson	pollock	.
who	here	 like 	 s 	 	the	work	of	jackson	pollock	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	who	here	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	them	?
they	just	do	n't	like	it	.
i	'm	not	going	to	make	a	claim	about	who	's	right	,	but	i	will	make	an	 empir 	 ical 	 	claim	about	people	's	 intuit 	 ions 	 	,	which	is	that	,	if	you	like	the	work	of	jackson	pollock	,	you	'll	tend	more	so	than	the	people	who	do	n't	like	it	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	these	 work 	 s 	 	are	difficult	to	create	,	that	they	 requir 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	time	and	energy	and	creative	energy	.
i	use	jackson	pollock	on	purpose	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	young	american	artist	who	 paint 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	the	style	of	jackson	pollock	,	and	her	work	was	worth	 man 	 y 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	in	large	part	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	young	artist	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	marla	olmstead	who	did	most	of	her	work	when	she	was	three	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	marla	olmstead	is	her	family	made	the	 mistak 	 e 	 	of	 invit 	 ing 	 	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	program	60	 minute 	 s 	 	ii	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	house	to	film	her	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	then	 report 	 ed 	 	that	her	father	was	 coach 	 ing 	 	her	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	came	out	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	the	value	of	her	art	 drop 	 ped 	 	to	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	the	same	art	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	,	but	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	had	 change 	 d 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 focus 	 ing 	 	now	on	the	visual	 art 	 s 	 	,	but	i	want	to	give	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	from	music	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	joshua	bell	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	 viol 	 in 	 ist 	 	.
and	the	washington	post	 report 	 er 	 	gene	weingarten	 decide 	 d 	 	to	enlist	him	for	an	 au 	 d 	 acious 	 	experiment	.
the	question	is	:	how	much	would	people	like	joshua	bell	,	the	music	of	joshua	bell	,	if	they	did	n't	know	they	 we 	 re 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	joshua	bell	?
so	he	got	joshua	bell	to	take	his	million	dollar	 viol 	 in 	 	down	to	a	washington	d.c.	 sub 	 way 	 	station	and	stand	in	the	corner	and	see	how	much	money	he	would	make	.
and	here	's	a	brief	clip	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
after	 be 	 ing 	 	there	for	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	an	hour	,	he	made	32	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
not	bad	.	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	not	good	.
 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	enjoy	the	music	of	joshua	bell	,	you	have	to	know	you	're	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	joshua	bell	.
he	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	20	 dollar 	 s 	 	more	than	that	,	but	he	did	n't	count	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	woman	 come 	 s 	 	up	--	you	see	at	the	end	of	the	video	--	she	 come 	 s 	 	up	.
she	had	heard	him	at	the	library	of	congress	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	before	at	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 vag 	 ant 	 	black	-	tie	 af 	 fair 	 	.
so	she	's	 stunn 	 ed 	 	that	he	's	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	a	 sub 	 way 	 	station	.
so	she	's	 s 	 truck 	 	with	 p 	 ity 	 	.
she	 reach 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	her	 pur 	 s 	 e 	 	and	 hand 	 s 	 	him	a	20	.
the	second	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	music	is	from	john	cage	's	 modern 	 ist 	 	 com 	 position 	 	,	``	4'33	``	.	``
 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 com 	 position 	 	where	the	pianist	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	at	a	bench	,	 open 	 s 	 	up	the	piano	and	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	and	 do 	 es 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	four	 minute 	 s 	 	and	33	 second 	 s 	 	--	that	period	of	silence	.
and	people	have	different	 view 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	what	i	want	to	point	out	is	you	can	buy	 th 	 is 	 	from	itunes	.
for	a	dollar	99	,	you	can	listen	to	that	silence	,	which	is	different	than	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	silence	.
now	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	so	far	about	pleasure	,	but	what	i	want	to	suggest	is	that	 every 	 thing 	 	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	 appli 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	to	pain	.
and	how	you	think	about	what	you	're	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	,	your	 belief 	 s 	 	about	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	it	,	affect	how	it	 hurt 	 s 	 	.
one	 love 	 ly 	 	experiment	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	kurt	gray	and	dan	wegner	.
what	they	did	was	they	 hook 	 ed 	 	up	harvard	 under 	 graduate 	 s 	 	to	an	electric	shock	machine	.
and	they	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 pain 	 ful 	 	electric	 shock 	 s 	 	.
so	it	was	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	five	 pain 	 ful 	 	 shock 	 s 	 	.
half	of	them	are	told	that	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 give 	 n 	 	the	 shock 	 s 	 	by	 some 	 body 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	room	,	but	the	person	in	the	other	room	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	they	're	giving	them	 shock 	 s 	 	.
there	's	no	 male 	 vol 	 ence 	 	,	they	're	just	 press 	 ing 	 	a	button	.
the	first	shock	is	 record 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
the	second	shock	 feel 	 s 	 	less	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	get	a	bit	used	to	it	.
the	third	 drop 	 s 	 	,	the	fourth	,	the	fifth	.
the	pain	 get 	 s 	 	less	.
in	the	other	condition	,	they	're	told	that	the	person	in	the	next	room	is	 shock 	 ing 	 	them	on	purpose	--	 know 	 s 	 	they	're	 shock 	 ing 	 	them	.
the	first	shock	 hurt 	 s 	 	like	hell	.
the	second	shock	 hurt 	 s 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	,	and	the	third	and	the	fourth	and	the	fifth	.
it	 hurt 	 s 	 	more	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	 some 	 body 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	it	to	you	on	purpose	.
the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	pain	under	the	right	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	can	transform	 in 	 to 	 	pleasure	.
 human 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	that	will	often	seek	out	low	-	level	 dose 	 s 	 	of	pain	in	controlled	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	and	take	pleasure	from	it	--	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	eating	of	hot	chili	 pepper 	 s 	 	and	roller	 coast 	 er 	 	 ride 	 s 	 	.
the	point	was	 nice 	 ly 	 	 summarize 	 d 	 	by	the	poet	john	milton	who	wrote	,	``	the	mind	is	 it 	 s 	 	own	place	,	and	in	 it 	 self 	 	can	make	a	heaven	of	hell	,	a	hell	of	heaven	.	``
and	i	'll	end	with	that	.	thank	you	.
