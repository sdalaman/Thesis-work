people	are	living	 long 	 er 	 	and	 socie 	 ties 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 gray 	 er 	 	.
you	hear	about	it	all	the	time	.
you	read	about	it	in	your	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
you	hear	about	it	on	your	 tele 	 vision 	 	 set 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	'm	 concern 	 ed 	 	that	we	hear	about	it	so	much	that	we	've	come	to	accept	 long 	 er 	 	 live 	 s 	 	with	a	kind	of	a	 com 	 place 	 ncy 	 	,	even	ease	.
but	make	no	 mistak 	 e 	 	,	 long 	 er 	 	 live 	 s 	 	can	and	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	will	improve	quality	of	life	at	all	 age 	 s 	 	.
now	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	let	me	just	zoom	out	for	a	minute	.
more	 year 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	to	average	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	in	the	20th	century	than	all	 year 	 s 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	all	prior	millennia	of	human	evolution	 combine 	 d 	 	.
in	the	blink	of	an	eye	,	we	 near 	 ly 	 	 double 	 d 	 	the	length	of	time	that	we	're	living	.
so	if	you	ever	feel	like	you	do	n't	have	 th 	 is 	 	aging	thing	 quit 	 e 	 	 peg 	 ged 	 	,	do	n't	kick	 your 	 self 	 	.
it	's	brand	new	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	 fertil 	 ity 	 	rates	fell	 a 	 cross 	 	that	 ver 	 y 	 	same	period	that	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	was	going	up	,	that	pyramid	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	age	in	the	population	,	with	 man 	 y 	 	young	 one 	 s 	 	at	the	bottom	 win 	 now 	 ed 	 	to	a	 tin 	 y 	 	peak	of	 old 	 er 	 	people	who	make	it	and	 surviv 	 e 	 	to	old	age	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 shaped 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 rect 	 angle 	 	.
and	now	,	if	you	're	the	kind	of	person	who	can	get	 chill 	 s 	 	from	population	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	these	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	should	do	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	for	the	first	time	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	species	,	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	born	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	grow	old	.
how	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
well	we	're	no	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 hard 	 ier 	 	than	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	in	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	is	the	 remark 	 able 	 	product	of	culture	--	the	 cruci 	 ble 	 	that	 hold 	 s 	 	science	and	technology	and	wide	-	scale	 change 	 s 	 	in	behavior	that	improve	health	and	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
through	cultural	 change 	 s 	 	,	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 large 	 ly 	 	 eliminate 	 d 	 	early	death	so	that	people	can	now	live	out	 the 	 ir 	 	full	 live 	 s 	 	.
now	there	are	 problem 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	aging	--	 disease 	 s 	 	,	poverty	,	loss	of	social	 stat 	 us 	 	.
it	's	 hard 	 ly 	 	time	to	rest	on	our	laurels	.
but	the	more	we	learn	about	aging	,	the	 clear 	 er 	 	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	that	a	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	 down 	 ward 	 	course	is	 gross 	 ly 	 	 in 	 accurate 	 	.
aging	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	some	 ra 	 ther 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 improve 	 ments 	 	--	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	knowledge	,	 expert 	 ise 	 	--	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	life	improve	.
that	's	right	,	 old 	 er 	 	people	are	happy	.
they	're	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	than	middle	-	aged	people	,	and	 young 	 er 	 	people	 certain 	 ly 	 	.
 stud 	 y 	 	after	 stud 	 y 	 	is	coming	to	the	same	 con 	 clusion 	 	.
the	cdc	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	a	survey	where	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	 respond 	 ent 	 s 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	tell	them	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 experience 	 d 	 	significant	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 di 	 stress 	 	in	the	previous	week	.
and	 few 	 er 	 	 old 	 er 	 	people	 answer 	 ed 	 	 affirm 	 ative 	 ly 	 	to	that	question	than	middle	-	aged	people	,	and	 young 	 er 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	a	 re 	 cent 	 	gallup	poll	 ask 	 ed 	 	 particip 	 ants 	 	how	much	stress	and	worry	and	anger	they	had	 experience 	 d 	 	the	previous	day	.
and	stress	,	worry	,	anger	all	 de 	 crease 	 	with	age	.
now	social	 scientist 	 s 	 	call	 th 	 is 	 	the	paradox	of	aging	.
after	all	,	aging	is	not	a	piece	of	cake	.
so	we	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	to	see	if	we	could	 un 	 do 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	.
we	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	it	may	be	that	the	current	 generation 	 s 	 	of	 old 	 er 	 	people	are	and	 al 	 ways 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	.
that	is	that	 young 	 er 	 	people	 to 	 day 	 	may	not	 typical 	 ly 	 	experience	these	 improve 	 ments 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	grow	 old 	 er 	 	.
we	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	well	 may 	 be 	 	 old 	 er 	 	people	are	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	a	positive	spin	on	an	 other 	 wise 	 	 depress 	 ing 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
but	the	more	we	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 dis 	 a 	 vow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	,	the	more	evidence	we	find	to	support	it	.
 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	and	i	 embark 	 ed 	 	on	a	 stud 	 y 	 	where	we	 follow 	 ed 	 	the	same	group	of	people	over	a	10	-	year	period	.
 original 	 ly 	 	the	 s 	 ample 	 	was	aged	18	to	94	.
and	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	and	how	 the 	 ir 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	grew	 old 	 er 	 	.
our	 particip 	 ants 	 	would	carry	 electron 	 ic 	 	 page 	 rs 	 	for	a	week	at	a	time	,	and	we	'd	page	them	 through 	 out 	 	the	day	and	 even 	 ing 	 s 	 	at	random	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	every	time	we	 page 	 d 	 	them	we	'd	ask	them	to	answer	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 question 	 s 	 	--	on	a	one	to	seven	scale	,	how	happy	are	you	right	now	?
how	 s 	 ad 	 	are	you	right	now	?
how	 frust 	 rated 	 	are	you	right	now	?	--	so	that	we	could	get	a	sense	of	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	day	-	to	-	day	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	using	 th 	 is 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	,	we	find	that	it	's	not	one	 part 	 icular 	 	generation	that	's	 do 	 ing 	 	better	than	the	 other 	 s 	 	,	but	the	same	 individual 	 s 	 	over	time	come	to	report	 relat 	 ively 	 	 great 	 er 	 	positive	experience	.
now	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 light 	 	 down 	 turn 	 	at	 ver 	 y 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 age 	 s 	 	.
and	there	is	a	 s 	 light 	 	 down 	 turn 	 	.
but	at	no	point	 do 	 es 	 	it	return	to	the	 level 	 s 	 	we	see	in	early	 adult 	 hood 	 	.
now	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	too	 simpl 	 istic 	 	to	say	that	 old 	 er 	 	people	are	``	happy	.	``
in	our	 stud 	 y 	 	,	they	are	more	positive	,	but	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	than	 young 	 er 	 	people	to	experience	 mix 	 ed 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	--	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	at	the	same	time	you	experience	happiness	;	you	know	,	that	tear	in	the	eye	when	you	're	 smil 	 ing 	 	at	a	friend	.
and	other	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	that	 old 	 er 	 	people	seem	to	engage	with	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	more	 comfort 	 ably 	 	.
they	're	more	 accept 	 ing 	 	of	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	than	 young 	 er 	 	people	are	.
and	we	suspect	that	 th 	 is 	 	may	help	to	explain	why	 old 	 er 	 	people	are	better	than	 young 	 er 	 	people	at	solving	 hot 	 ly 	 	-	charged	 emotion 	 al 	 	 conflict 	 s 	 	and	 debate 	 s 	 	.
 old 	 er 	 	people	can	view	 in 	 justice 	 	with	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	but	not	despair	.
and	all	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	equal	,	 old 	 er 	 	people	direct	 the 	 ir 	 	cognitive	 resource 	 s 	 	,	like	attention	and	 memor 	 y 	 	,	to	positive	information	more	than	negative	.
if	we	show	 old 	 er 	 	,	middle	-	aged	,	 young 	 er 	 	people	 image 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	you	see	on	the	screen	,	and	we	 lat 	 er 	 	ask	them	to	recall	all	the	 image 	 s 	 	that	they	can	,	 old 	 er 	 	people	,	but	not	 young 	 er 	 	people	,	remember	more	positive	 image 	 s 	 	than	negative	 image 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	 old 	 er 	 	and	 young 	 er 	 	people	to	view	 face 	 s 	 	in	 labor 	 atory 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	some	 frown 	 ing 	 	,	some	 smil 	 ing 	 	.
 old 	 er 	 	people	look	 to 	 ward 	 	the	 smil 	 ing 	 	 face 	 s 	 	and	away	from	the	 frown 	 ing 	 	,	 ang 	 ry 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
in	day	-	to	-	day	life	,	 th 	 is 	 	 transl 	 ates 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 great 	 er 	 	 enjoy 	 ment 	 	and	satisfaction	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	social	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	ask	about	possible	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	 may 	 be 	 	 old 	 er 	 	people	report	more	positive	 emotion 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 cognitive 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
we	've	 s 	 aid 	 	,	could	it	be	that	positive	 emotion 	 s 	 	are	 simpl 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	process	than	negative	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	and	so	you	 s 	 witch 	 	to	the	positive	 emotion 	 s 	 	?
 may 	 be 	 	our	neural	 center 	 s 	 	in	our	brain	are	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	that	we	're	 un 	 able 	 	to	process	negative	 emotion 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
but	that	's	not	the	case	.
the	most	 ment 	 ally 	 	sharp	 old 	 er 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	show	 th 	 is 	 	 posit 	 ivity 	 	effect	the	most	.
and	under	 condition 	 s 	 	where	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	,	 old 	 er 	 	people	do	process	the	negative	information	just	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	positive	information	.
so	how	can	 th 	 is 	 	be	?
well	in	our	research	,	we	've	found	that	these	 change 	 s 	 	are	 ground 	 ed 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	in	the	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	human	ability	to	monitor	time	--	not	just	clock	time	and	calendar	time	,	but	 life 	 time 	 	.
and	if	there	's	a	paradox	of	aging	,	it	's	that	 recogn 	 izing 	 	that	we	wo	n't	live	 fore 	 ver 	 	 change 	 s 	 	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	life	in	positive	ways	.
when	time	 horizon 	 s 	 	are	long	and	 nebul 	 ous 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	 typical 	 ly 	 	are	in	youth	,	people	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	soak	up	all	the	information	they	possibly	can	,	taking	 risk 	 s 	 	,	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	.
we	might	 s 	 pend 	 	time	with	people	we	do	n't	even	like	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 some 	 how 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
we	might	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
we	go	on	blind	 date 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	after	all	,	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	out	,	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
people	over	50	do	n't	go	on	blind	 date 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	age	,	our	time	 horizon 	 s 	 	grow	 short 	 er 	 	and	our	 goal 	 s 	 	change	.
when	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	we	do	n't	have	all	the	time	in	the	world	,	we	see	our	 prior 	 ities 	 	most	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
we	take	less	notice	of	trivial	 matter 	 s 	 	.
we	savor	life	.
we	're	more	 appreci 	 ative 	 	,	more	open	to	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	.
we	invest	in	more	 emotion 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	life	,	and	life	 get 	 s 	 	better	,	so	we	're	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	day	-	to	-	day	.
but	that	same	shift	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	us	to	have	less	 toler 	 ance 	 	than	ever	by	2015	,	there	will	be	more	people	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	over	the	age	of	60	than	under	15	.
what	will	happen	to	 socie 	 ties 	 	that	are	top	-	heavy	with	 old 	 er 	 	people	?
the	 number 	 s 	 	wo	n't	determine	the	 out 	 come 	 	.
culture	will	.
if	we	invest	in	science	and	technology	and	find	 solution 	 s 	 	for	the	real	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 old 	 er 	 	people	face	and	we	 capital 	 ize 	 	on	the	 ver 	 y 	 	real	 strength 	 s 	 	of	 old 	 er 	 	people	,	then	 add 	 ed 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	life	can	 dramat 	 ically 	 	improve	quality	of	life	at	all	 age 	 s 	 	.
 socie 	 ties 	 	with	 million 	 s 	 	of	 talent 	 ed 	 	,	 emotion 	 ally 	 	 s 	 table 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	who	are	 health 	 ier 	 	and	better	educated	than	any	 generation 	 s 	 	before	them	,	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	knowledge	about	the	practical	 matter 	 s 	 	of	life	and	 motiv 	 ated 	 	to	solve	the	big	 issue 	 s 	 	can	be	better	 socie 	 ties 	 	than	we	have	ever	known	.
my	father	,	who	is	92	,	 like 	 s 	 	to	say	,	``	let	's	stop	 talk 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	about	how	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	old	 folk 	 s 	 	and	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	how	to	get	them	to	 s 	 ave 	 	us	all	.	``
