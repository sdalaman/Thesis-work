my	big	idea	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	idea	that	can	 un 	 lock 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	big	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	at	the	moment	 dorm 	 ant 	 	 in 	 side 	 	us	.
and	my	little	idea	that	will	do	that	is	sleep	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	room	of	type	-	a	women	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	room	of	sleep	-	 depriv 	 ed 	 	women	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	hard	way	,	the	value	of	sleep	.
two	-	and	-	a	-	half	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 faint 	 ed 	 	from	 exhaust 	 ion 	 	.
i	hit	my	head	on	my	desk	.	i	broke	my	 cheek 	 bone 	 	,	i	got	five	 stitch 	 es 	 	on	my	right	eye	.
and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	the	journey	of	 re 	 discover 	 ing 	 	the	value	of	sleep	.
and	in	the	course	of	that	,	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	,	i	met	with	medical	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	that	the	way	to	a	more	productive	,	more	inspired	,	more	 joy 	 ful 	 	life	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	sleep	.
and	we	women	are	going	to	lead	the	way	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	revolution	,	 th 	 is 	 	new	feminist	issue	.
we	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	going	to	sleep	our	way	to	the	top	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	for	men	,	sleep	 depriv 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	 vir 	 ility 	 	symbol	.
i	was	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	with	a	guy	who	 brag 	 ged 	 	that	he	had	 on 	 ly 	 	gotten	four	 hour 	 s 	 	sleep	the	night	before	.
and	i	felt	like	 say 	 ing 	 	to	him	--	but	i	did	n't	say	it	--	i	felt	like	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	you	know	what	?
if	you	had	gotten	five	,	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	``
there	is	now	a	kind	of	sleep	 depriv 	 ation 	 	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	here	in	washington	,	if	you	try	to	make	a	 break 	 fast 	 	date	,	and	you	say	,	``	how	about	eight	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	?	``
they	're	 like 	 ly 	 	to	tell	you	,	``	eight	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	is	too	late	for	me	,	but	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	can	get	a	game	of	tennis	in	and	do	a	few	 con 	 ference 	 	 call 	 s 	 	and	meet	you	at	eight	.	``
and	they	think	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	they	are	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	and	productive	,	but	the	truth	is	they	're	not	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	,	at	the	moment	,	have	had	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	in	business	,	in	finance	,	in	 politic 	 s 	 	,	making	 terr 	 ible 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	.
so	a	high	i.q	.
 do 	 es 	 	not	mean	that	you	're	a	good	 lead 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	see	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	before	it	 hit 	 s 	 	the	 titan 	 ic 	 	.
and	we	've	had	far	too	 man 	 y 	 	 ice 	 berg 	 s 	 	hitting	our	titanics	.
in	fact	,	i	have	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	if	lehman	 brother 	 s 	 	was	lehman	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	,	they	might	still	be	around	.
while	all	the	 brother 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	just	 be 	 ing 	 	hyper	-	 connect 	 ed 	 	24/7	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	sister	would	have	 notice 	 d 	 	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	would	have	 wok 	 en 	 	up	from	a	seven	-	and	-	a	-	half	-	or	eight	-	hour	sleep	and	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	see	the	big	picture	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	facing	all	the	 multi 	 ple 	 	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	in	our	world	at	the	moment	,	what	is	good	for	us	on	a	personal	level	,	what	's	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	more	joy	,	 grat 	 itude 	 	,	 effective 	 ness 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	and	be	the	best	for	our	own	 care 	 ers 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	what	is	best	for	the	world	.
so	i	urge	you	to	shut	your	 eye 	 s 	 	and	discover	the	great	 idea 	 s 	 	that	lie	 in 	 side 	 	us	,	to	shut	your	 engine 	 s 	 	and	discover	the	power	of	sleep	.
thank	you	.
