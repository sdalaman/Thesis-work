my	search	is	 al 	 ways 	 	to	find	ways	to	 chronic 	 le 	 	,	to	share	and	to	document	 st 	 ories 	 	about	people	,	just	 every 	 day 	 	people	.
 st 	 ories 	 	that	 off 	 er 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	that	lean	 in 	 to 	 	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	but	that	are	never	 sentiment 	 al 	 	,	that	never	look	away	from	the	 dark 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	're	never	more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	than	when	we	're	most	 ug 	 ly 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	moment	we	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	we	're	made	of	.
 a 	 s 	 	chris	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	grew	up	in	nigeria	with	a	whole	generation	--	in	the	'80s	--	of	 student 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 protest 	 ing 	 	a	 militar 	 y 	 	 dictator 	 ship 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	.
so	it	was	n't	just	me	,	there	was	a	whole	generation	of	us	.
but	what	i	've	come	to	learn	is	that	the	world	is	never	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	in	grand	 mess 	 ian 	 ic 	 	 gest 	 ures 	 	,	but	in	the	simple	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	gentle	,	soft	,	 al 	 most 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	 act 	 s 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 every 	 day 	 	 act 	 s 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
in	south	africa	,	they	have	a	phrase	 call 	 ed 	 	ubuntu	.
ubuntu	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	a	 philosoph 	 y 	 	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	for	me	to	be	human	is	for	you	to	reflect	my	 human 	 ity 	 	back	at	me	.
but	if	you	're	like	me	,	my	 human 	 ity 	 	is	more	like	a	window	.
i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	see	it	,	i	do	n't	pay	attention	to	it	 un 	 til 	 	there	's	,	you	know	,	like	a	bug	that	's	dead	on	the	window	.
then	 sudden 	 ly 	 	i	see	it	,	and	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	never	good	.
it	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	when	i	'm	 cus 	 s 	 ing 	 	in	traffic	at	 some 	 one 	 	who	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	drive	 the 	 ir 	 	car	and	drink	coffee	and	 s 	 end 	 	 email 	 s 	 	and	make	 note 	 s 	 	.
so	what	ubuntu	 re 	 ally 	 	 say 	 s 	 	is	that	there	is	no	way	for	us	to	be	human	 with 	 out 	 	other	people	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
so	,	i	thought	i	should	start	with	some	 st 	 ories 	 	.
i	should	tell	you	some	 st 	 ories 	 	about	 remark 	 able 	 	people	,	so	i	thought	i	'd	start	with	my	mother	.
and	she	was	dark	,	too	.
my	mother	was	english	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	met	in	oxford	in	the	'50s	,	and	my	mother	 move 	 d 	 	to	nigeria	and	lived	there	.
she	was	five	foot	two	,	 ver 	 y 	 	feisty	and	 ver 	 y 	 	english	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	english	my	mother	is	--	or	was	,	she	just	 pass 	 ed 	 	.
she	came	out	to	california	,	to	los	angeles	,	to	visit	me	,	and	we	went	to	malibu	,	which	she	thought	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 disappoint 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	we	went	to	a	fish	restaurant	,	and	we	had	chad	,	the	 surf 	 er 	 	 du 	 de 	 	,	 serv 	 ing 	 	us	,	and	he	came	up	and	my	mother	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	have	any	 special 	 s 	 	,	young	man	?	``
and	chad	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 s 	 ure 	 	,	like	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	,	like	,	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	,	that	's	,	like	,	 roll 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	like	,	 was 	 a 	 bi 	 	,	like	,	crust	.
it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	rad	.	``
and	my	mother	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	language	is	he	 s 	 peaking 	 	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	english	,	mum	.	``
and	she	 s 	 hook 	 	her	head	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	these	americans	.	we	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	language	,	why	do	n't	they	use	it	?	``
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	woman	,	who	 convert 	 ed 	 	from	the	church	of	england	to	catholicism	when	she	married	my	father	--	and	there	's	no	one	more	 ra 	 bid 	 	than	a	catholic	convert	--	 decide 	 d 	 	to	teach	in	the	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	in	nigeria	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	among	igbo	women	,	the	billings	 ov 	 ul 	 ation 	 	method	,	which	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	approved	birth	control	by	the	catholic	church	.
but	her	igbo	was	n't	too	good	.
so	she	took	me	 a 	 long 	 	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	.
i	was	seven	.
so	,	here	are	these	women	,	who	never	discuss	 the 	 ir 	 	period	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 husband 	 s 	 	,	and	here	i	am	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	,	``	well	,	how	often	do	you	get	your	period	?	``
and	,	``	do	you	notice	any	 dis 	 charge 	 s 	 	?	``
and	,	``	how	swollen	is	your	vulva	?	``
she	never	would	have	thought	of	 her 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	feminist	,	my	mother	,	but	she	 al 	 ways 	 	used	to	say	,	``	 any 	 thing 	 	a	man	can	do	,	i	can	fix	.	``
and	when	my	father	 complain 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	where	she	's	taking	a	seven	-	year	-	old	boy	to	teach	 th 	 is 	 	birth	control	,	you	know	,	he	used	to	say	,	``	oh	,	you	're	 turn 	 ing 	 	him	 in 	 to 	 	--	you	're	 teach 	 ing 	 	him	how	to	be	a	woman	.	``
my	mother	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 some 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	woman	--	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	biafran	war	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	caught	in	the	war	.
it	was	my	mother	with	five	little	children	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	her	one	year	,	through	 refuge 	 e 	 	camp	after	 refuge 	 e 	 	camp	,	to	make	her	way	to	an	 air 	 strip 	 	where	we	can	fly	out	of	the	country	.
at	every	single	 refuge 	 e 	 	camp	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	to	face	off	 soldier 	 s 	 	who	want	to	take	my	elder	brother	mark	,	who	was	nine	,	and	make	him	a	boy	soldier	.
can	you	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	five	-	foot	-	two	woman	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	to	men	with	 gun 	 s 	 	who	want	to	kill	us	?
all	through	that	one	year	,	my	mother	never	 cri 	 ed 	 	one	time	,	not	once	.
but	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	lisbon	,	in	the	 air 	 port 	 	,	about	to	fly	to	england	,	 th 	 is 	 	woman	saw	my	mother	 wear 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	dress	,	which	had	 be 	 en 	 	 wash 	 ed 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	it	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	see	through	,	with	five	 re 	 ally 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	-	looking	 kid 	 s 	 	,	came	over	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	she	told	 th 	 is 	 	woman	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	woman	 empti 	 ed 	 	out	her	 suit 	 case 	 	and	 g 	 ave 	 	all	of	her	 clothe 	 s 	 	to	my	mother	,	and	to	us	,	and	the	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	of	her	 kid 	 s 	 	,	who	did	n't	like	that	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	but	--	--	that	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	time	she	 cri 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	remember	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	was	writing	about	my	mother	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	,	``	why	did	you	cry	then	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	you	can	steel	your	heart	against	any	kind	of	trouble	,	any	kind	of	 horr 	 or 	 	.
but	the	simple	act	of	 kind 	 ness 	 	from	a	complete	 strange 	 r 	 	will	 un 	 stitch 	 	you	.	``
the	old	women	in	my	father	's	village	,	after	 th 	 is 	 	war	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	 memor 	 ized 	 	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	every	dead	person	,	and	they	would	 s 	 ing 	 	these	 dirge 	 s 	 	,	made	up	of	these	 name 	 s 	 	.
 dirge 	 s 	 	so	 melanc 	 hol 	 ic 	 	that	they	would	scorch	you	.
and	they	would	 s 	 ing 	 	them	 on 	 ly 	 	when	they	 plant 	 ed 	 	the	rice	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 seed 	 ing 	 	the	 heart 	 s 	 	of	the	dead	 in 	 to 	 	the	rice	.
but	when	it	came	for	harvest	time	,	they	would	 s 	 ing 	 	these	 joy 	 ful 	 	 song 	 s 	 	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	made	up	of	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	every	child	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	born	that	year	.
and	then	the	next	 plant 	 ing 	 	season	,	when	they	 s 	 ang 	 	the	dirge	,	they	would	 re 	 move 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	dead	that	 equal 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	that	 we 	 re 	 	born	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	these	women	 enact 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
did	you	know	,	that	before	the	genocide	in	rwanda	,	the	word	for	rape	and	the	word	for	marriage	was	the	same	one	?
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	women	are	 re 	 building 	 	rwanda	.
did	you	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	after	apartheid	,	when	the	new	government	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	parliament	 house 	 s 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	female	 toilet 	 s 	 	in	the	building	?
which	would	seem	to	suggest	that	apartheid	was	 entire 	 ly 	 	the	business	of	men	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	to	say	,	that	 de 	 spite 	 	the	 horr 	 or 	 	,	and	 de 	 spite 	 	the	death	,	women	are	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 count 	 ed 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	never	 seem 	 s 	 	to	matter	 ver 	 y 	 	much	to	us	.
when	i	was	growing	up	in	nigeria	--	and	i	should	n't	say	nigeria	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	too	general	,	but	in	afikpo	,	the	igbo	part	of	the	country	where	i	'm	from	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 rite 	 s 	 	of	 pass 	 age 	 	for	young	men	.
men	 we 	 re 	 	taught	to	be	men	in	the	ways	in	which	we	are	not	women	,	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	it	is	.
and	a	lot	of	 ritual 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	,	 kill 	 ing 	 	little	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 progress 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	so	when	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	13	--	and	,	i	mean	,	it	made	sense	,	it	was	an	 agr 	 arian 	 	community	,	 some 	 body 	 	had	to	kill	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	there	was	no	whole	 food 	 s 	 	you	could	go	and	get	kangaroo	steak	at	--	so	when	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	13	,	it	was	my	turn	now	to	kill	a	goat	.
and	i	was	 th 	 is 	 	weird	,	sensitive	kid	,	who	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	do	it	,	but	i	had	to	do	it	.
and	i	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
but	a	friend	of	mine	,	 call 	 ed 	 	emmanuel	,	who	was	 significant 	 ly 	 	 old 	 er 	 	than	me	,	who	'd	 be 	 en 	 	a	boy	soldier	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	biafran	war	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	come	with	me	.
which	sort	of	made	me	feel	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	'd	 s 	 een 	 	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	,	when	i	was	growing	up	,	he	used	to	tell	me	 st 	 ories 	 	about	how	he	used	to	bayonet	people	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 intestine 	 s 	 	would	fall	out	,	but	they	would	keep	running	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 come 	 s 	 	with	me	.
and	i	do	n't	know	if	you	've	ever	heard	a	goat	,	or	 s 	 een 	 	one	--	they	sound	like	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	that	's	why	we	call	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	``	a	song	of	a	goat	.	``
my	friend	brad	kessler	 say 	 s 	 	that	we	did	n't	 be 	 come 	 	human	 un 	 til 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	 goat 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	a	goat	's	 eye 	 s 	 	are	like	a	child	's	 eye 	 s 	 	.
so	when	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	kill	 th 	 is 	 	goat	and	i	could	n't	,	emmanuel	bent	down	,	he	 put 	 s 	 	his	hand	over	the	mouth	of	the	goat	,	 cover 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	so	i	do	n't	have	to	look	 in 	 to 	 	them	,	while	i	kill	the	goat	.
it	did	n't	seem	like	a	lot	,	for	 th 	 is 	 	guy	who	'd	 s 	 een 	 	so	much	,	and	to	whom	the	 kill 	 ing 	 	of	a	goat	must	have	 seem 	 ed 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 quo 	 tid 	 ian 	 	experience	,	still	found	it	in	 him 	 self 	 	to	try	to	protect	me	.
i	was	a	wimp	.
i	 cri 	 ed 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
and	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	he	did	n't	say	a	word	.
he	just	 s 	 at 	 	there	 watch 	 ing 	 	me	cry	for	an	hour	.
and	then	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	it	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	difficult	,	but	if	you	cry	like	 th 	 is 	 	every	time	,	you	will	die	of	 heart 	 break 	 	.
just	know	that	it	is	 en 	 ough 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	to	know	that	it	is	difficult	.	``
of	course	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 goat 	 s 	 	 make 	 s 	 	me	think	of	sheep	,	and	not	in	good	ways	.
so	,	i	was	born	two	 day 	 s 	 	after	christmas	.
so	growing	up	,	you	know	,	i	had	a	cake	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	but	i	never	got	any	 present 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	born	two	 day 	 s 	 	after	christmas	.
so	,	i	was	about	nine	,	and	my	uncle	had	just	come	back	from	germany	,	and	we	had	the	catholic	priest	over	,	my	mother	was	 entertain 	 ing 	 	him	with	tea	.
and	my	uncle	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	where	are	chris	'	 present 	 s 	 	?	``
and	my	mother	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	talk	about	that	in	front	of	 guest 	 s 	 	.	``
but	he	was	desperate	to	show	that	he	'd	just	come	back	,	so	he	 summon 	 ed 	 	me	up	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bed 	 room 	 	,	my	 bed 	 room 	 	.
take	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	out	of	the	 suit 	 case 	 	.
it	's	your	 birth 	 day 	 	present	.	``
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	he	thought	i	'd	take	a	book	or	a	shirt	,	but	i	found	an	 infla 	 table 	 	sheep	.
so	,	i	 ble 	 w 	 	it	up	and	ran	 in 	 to 	 	the	living	room	,	my	finger	where	it	should	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	,	i	was	 wav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 buzz 	 ing 	 	sheep	around	,	and	my	mother	 look 	 ed 	 	like	she	was	going	to	die	of	shock	.
and	father	mcgetrick	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 flustered 	 	,	just	 stir 	 red 	 	his	tea	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	my	mother	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	all	right	daphne	,	i	'm	scottish	.	``
my	last	 day 	 s 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	,	the	last	18	 month 	 s 	 	,	my	 cell 	 mate 	 	--	for	the	last	year	,	the	first	year	of	the	last	18	 month 	 s 	 	--	my	 cell 	 mate 	 	was	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
the	name	was	john	james	,	and	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	if	a	family	member	 commit 	 ted 	 	a	crime	,	the	 militar 	 y 	 	would	hold	you	 a 	 s 	 	 ran 	 som 	 	till	your	family	 turn 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	.
so	,	here	was	 th 	 is 	 	14	-	year	-	old	kid	on	death	row	.
and	not	 every 	 body 	 	on	death	row	was	a	 politic 	 al 	 	prisoner	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	some	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	people	there	.
and	he	had	 smuggle 	 d 	 	in	two	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	two	 com 	 ic 	 	 book 	 s 	 	--	``	spiderman	``	and	``	x	-	men	.	``
he	was	 obsess 	 ed 	 	.
and	when	he	got	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 read 	 ing 	 	them	,	he	 start 	 ed 	 	to	teach	the	men	in	death	row	how	to	read	,	with	these	 com 	 ic 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	i	remember	night	after	night	,	you	'd	hear	all	these	men	,	these	 re 	 ally 	 	 hard 	 ened 	 	 criminal 	 s 	 	,	 huddl 	 ed 	 	around	john	james	,	 re 	 cit 	 ing 	 	,	``	take	that	,	spidey	!	``
it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	.
i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	.
he	did	n't	know	what	death	row	 me 	 ant 	 	.
i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	there	twice	,	and	i	was	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	that	i	was	going	to	die	.
and	he	would	 al 	 ways 	 	laugh	,	and	say	,	``	come	on	,	man	,	we	'll	make	it	out	.	``
then	i	'd	say	,	``	how	do	you	know	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	heard	it	on	the	 grape 	 vine 	 	.	``
they	 kill 	 ed 	 	him	.
they	 hand 	 cuff 	 ed 	 	him	to	a	chair	,	and	they	 tack 	 ed 	 	his	penis	to	a	table	with	a	six	-	inch	nail	,	then	left	him	there	to	 ble 	 ed 	 	to	death	.
that	's	how	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	let	my	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	be	known	.
all	around	us	,	 every 	 where 	 	,	there	are	people	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	igbo	used	to	say	that	they	built	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 god 	 s 	 	.
they	would	come	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	,	and	they	would	express	a	wish	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	wish	would	then	be	 br 	 ought 	 	to	a	priest	,	who	would	find	a	ritual	object	,	and	the	appropriate	 sacrifice 	 s 	 	would	be	made	,	and	the	 s 	 hr 	 ine 	 	would	be	built	for	the	god	.
but	if	the	god	 be 	 came 	 	 un 	 ru 	 ly 	 	and	 beg 	 an 	 	to	ask	for	human	sacrifice	,	the	igbos	would	destroy	the	god	.
they	would	knock	down	the	 s 	 hr 	 ine 	 	,	and	they	would	stop	 say 	 ing 	 	the	god	's	name	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	they	came	to	 re 	 claim 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	.
