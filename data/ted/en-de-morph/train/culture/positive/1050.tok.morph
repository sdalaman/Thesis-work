i	would	like	to	tell	you	all	that	you	are	all	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cy 	 borg 	 s 	 	,	but	not	the	 cy 	 borg 	 s 	 	that	you	think	.
you	're	not	robocop	,	and	you	're	not	terminator	,	but	you	're	 cy 	 borg 	 s 	 	every	time	you	look	at	a	computer	screen	or	use	one	of	your	cell	phone	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
so	what	's	a	good	definition	for	 cy 	 borg 	 	?
well	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	definition	is	``	an	organism	to	which	 exo 	 genous 	 	 component 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	for	the	purpose	of	 adapt 	 ing 	 	to	new	 environment 	 s 	 	.	``
that	came	from	a	1960	paper	on	space	travel	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	space	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	awkward	.
people	are	n't	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	there	.
but	 human 	 s 	 	are	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	and	they	like	to	add	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	so	they	can	go	to	the	alps	one	day	and	then	 be 	 come 	 	a	fish	in	the	sea	the	next	.
so	let	's	look	at	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	country	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	how	 fasci 	 nating 	 	these	people	are	,	how	 interest 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	are	,	how	 cur 	 ious 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	is	.	``
and	then	they	write	a	paper	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	a	few	other	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	read	it	,	and	we	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 ex 	 otic 	 	.
well	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	've	 sudden 	 ly 	 	found	a	new	species	.
i	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cy 	 borg 	 	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	,	have	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	 w 	 ow 	 	.	now	 sudden 	 ly 	 	we	're	a	new	form	of	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	,	and	look	at	these	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	,	and	look	at	these	 cur 	 ious 	 	 ritual 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	's	 do 	 ing 	 	around	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
they	're	 click 	 ing 	 	on	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 star 	 ing 	 	at	 screen 	 s 	 	.	``
now	there	's	a	reason	why	i	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	.
and	the	reason	is	that	tool	use	,	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	--	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	physical	 mod 	 ification 	 	of	self	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	us	to	extend	our	physical	 s 	 elves 	 	,	go	 fast 	 er 	 	,	hit	 thing 	 s 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	,	and	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	limit	on	that	.
but	now	what	we	're	looking	at	is	not	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	the	physical	self	,	but	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	the	mental	self	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	we	're	able	to	travel	 fast 	 er 	 	,	communicate	 different 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	other	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	we	're	all	 carry 	 ing 	 	around	little	mary	poppins	technology	.
we	can	put	 any 	 thing 	 	we	want	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	 heav 	 ier 	 	,	and	then	we	can	take	 any 	 thing 	 	out	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	your	computer	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	like	?
well	,	if	you	print	it	out	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	thousand	 pound 	 s 	 	of	material	that	you	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	around	all	the	time	.
and	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	lose	that	information	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	 sudden 	 ly 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	loss	in	your	mind	,	that	you	 sudden 	 ly 	 	feel	like	 some 	 thing 	 	's	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	you	are	n't	able	to	see	it	,	so	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	emotion	.
the	other	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	you	have	a	second	self	.
 whet 	 her 	 	you	like	it	or	not	,	you	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	show	up	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	people	are	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	your	second	self	when	you	're	not	there	.
and	so	you	have	to	be	 care 	 ful 	 	about	 leav 	 ing 	 	your	front	lawn	open	,	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	your	facebook	wall	,	so	that	people	do	n't	write	on	it	in	the	middle	of	the	night	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	we	have	to	start	to	maintain	our	second	self	.
you	have	to	present	 your 	 self 	 	in	digital	life	in	a	similar	way	that	you	would	in	your	analog	life	.
so	,	in	the	same	way	that	you	wake	up	,	take	a	shower	and	get	 dress 	 ed 	 	,	you	have	to	learn	to	do	that	for	your	digital	self	.
and	the	problem	is	that	a	lot	of	people	now	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 adolescent 	 s 	 	,	have	to	go	through	two	 adolescence 	 s 	 	.
they	have	to	go	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	one	,	that	's	 al 	 ready 	 	awkward	,	and	then	they	go	through	 the 	 ir 	 	second	self	's	adolescence	,	and	that	's	even	more	awkward	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	an	actual	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	what	they	've	gone	through	 on 	 line 	 	.
and	 any 	 body 	 	coming	in	new	to	technology	is	an	adolescent	 on 	 line 	 	right	now	,	and	so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	awkward	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	for	them	to	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	when	i	was	little	,	my	dad	would	 s 	 it 	 	me	down	at	night	and	he	would	say	,	``	i	'm	going	to	teach	you	about	time	and	space	in	the	future	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	great	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	one	day	,	``	what	's	the	 short 	 est 	 	distance	between	two	 point 	 s 	 	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	that	's	a	straight	line	.	you	told	me	that	 yester 	 day 	 	.	``
i	thought	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	no	.	here	's	a	better	way	.	``
he	took	a	piece	of	paper	,	drew	a	and	b	on	one	side	and	the	other	and	 fold 	 ed 	 	them	together	so	where	a	and	b	 touch 	 ed 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	is	the	 short 	 est 	 	distance	between	two	 point 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	dad	,	dad	,	dad	,	how	do	you	do	that	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	just	bend	time	and	space	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	an	awful	lot	of	energy	,	and	that	's	just	how	you	do	it	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	to	do	that	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	``
and	so	,	when	i	went	to	sleep	for	the	next	10	or	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	at	night	,	``	i	want	to	be	the	first	person	to	create	a	 worm 	 hole 	 	,	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	 accele 	 rate 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	.
and	i	want	to	make	a	time	machine	.	``
i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	to	my	future	self	using	tape	 record 	 ers 	 	.
but	then	what	i	 real 	 ized 	 	when	i	went	to	college	is	that	technology	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	get	 adopt 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	 adopt 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	use	it	and	it	's	made	for	 human 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	.
and	when	i	was	writing	my	thesis	on	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	was	 carry 	 ing 	 	around	 worm 	 hole 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 pocket 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 physical 	 ly 	 	 transport 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ment 	 ally 	 	 transport 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	would	click	on	a	button	,	and	they	would	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	to	b	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	``	oh	,	 w 	 ow 	 	.	i	found	it	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	.	``
so	over	time	,	time	and	space	have	 compress 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	can	stand	on	one	side	of	the	world	,	whisper	 some 	 thing 	 	and	be	heard	on	the	other	.
one	of	the	other	 idea 	 s 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	around	is	that	you	have	a	different	type	of	time	on	every	single	 de 	 vice 	 	that	you	use	.
every	single	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	tab	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	different	type	of	time	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	you	start	to	dig	around	for	your	external	 memor 	 ies 	 	--	where	did	you	 leav 	 e 	 	them	?
so	now	we	're	all	these	 paleonto 	 logists 	 	that	are	 dig 	 ging 	 	for	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	lost	on	our	external	 brain 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	around	in	our	 pocket 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 inc 	 ites 	 	a	sort	of	panic	 architect 	 ure 	 	--	``	oh	no	,	where	's	 th 	 is 	 	thing	?	``
we	're	all	``	i	love	lucy	``	on	a	great	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	of	information	,	and	we	ca	n't	keep	up	.
and	so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	when	we	 br 	 ing 	 	all	that	 in 	 to 	 	the	social	space	,	we	end	up	 check 	 ing 	 	our	 phone 	 s 	 	all	the	time	.
so	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	 ambi 	 ent 	 	 in 	 timacy 	 	.
it	's	not	that	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 every 	 body 	 	,	but	at	 any 	 time 	 	we	can	connect	to	 any 	 one 	 	we	want	.
and	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	print	out	 every 	 body 	 	in	your	cell	phone	,	the	room	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 crowd 	 ed 	 	.
these	are	the	people	that	you	have	access	to	right	now	,	in	general	--	all	of	these	people	,	all	of	your	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	that	you	can	connect	to	.
and	so	there	are	some	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	that	happen	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	is	that	people	are	n't	taking	time	for	mental	 reflect 	 ion 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	that	they	are	n't	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	and	 stop 	 ping 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	around	all	 t 	 hose 	 	people	in	the	room	all	the	time	that	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	compete	for	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	on	the	simultaneous	time	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	,	 paleonto 	 logy 	 	and	panic	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
they	're	not	just	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	when	you	have	no	external	 in 	 put 	 	,	that	is	a	time	when	there	is	a	creation	of	self	,	when	you	can	do	long	-	term	 plan 	 ning 	 	,	when	you	can	try	and	figure	out	who	you	 re 	 ally 	 	are	.
and	then	,	once	you	do	that	,	you	can	figure	out	how	to	present	your	second	self	in	a	legitimate	way	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 every 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	in	--	and	oh	,	i	have	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	have	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	have	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	they	're	not	going	to	be	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	down	-	time	,	that	they	have	an	instantaneous	button	-	 click 	 ing 	 	culture	,	and	that	 every 	 thing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	them	,	and	that	they	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	it	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
so	if	you	think	about	it	,	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 stop 	 ped 	 	either	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	external	 prost 	 hetic 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	and	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	are	 help 	 ing 	 	us	all	to	communicate	and	interact	with	each	other	.
but	when	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	 visual 	 ize 	 	it	,	all	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	right	now	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	of	the	mapping	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	--	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	 techno 	 logical 	 	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	time	in	the	entire	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	that	we	've	 connect 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
and	it	's	not	that	 machine 	 s 	 	are	taking	over	.
it	's	that	they	're	 help 	 ing 	 	us	to	be	more	human	,	 help 	 ing 	 	us	to	connect	with	each	other	.
the	most	 success 	 ful 	 	technology	 get 	 s 	 	out	of	the	way	and	 help 	 s 	 	us	live	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	it	 end 	 s 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	more	human	than	technology	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	co	-	creating	each	other	all	the	time	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 import 	 ant 	 	point	that	i	like	to	 stud 	 y 	 	:	that	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	that	it	's	still	a	human	 connect 	 ion 	 	--	it	's	just	 d 	 one 	 	in	a	different	way	.
we	're	just	increasing	our	 human 	 ness 	 	and	our	ability	to	connect	with	each	other	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	 geo 	 graphy 	 	.
so	that	's	why	i	 stud 	 y 	 	 cy 	 borg 	 	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	.
thank	you	.
