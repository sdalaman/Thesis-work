an	account	that	 explain 	 s 	 	the	presence	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	 every 	 thing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	list	is	not	going	to	be	easy	.
i	can	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	give	you	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	taste	of	what	i	regard	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	we	yet	have	.
and	we	get	it	not	from	a	 philosoph 	 er 	 	of	art	,	not	from	a	 post 	 modern 	 	art	 theor 	 ist 	 	or	a	 big 	 wig 	 	art	critic	.

of	course	,	a	lot	of	people	think	they	 al 	 ready 	 	know	the	proper	answer	to	the	question	,	``	what	is	 beaut 	 y 	 	?	``
it	's	in	the	eye	of	the	 be 	 holder 	 	.
it	's	 what 	 ever 	 	 move 	 s 	 	you	 personal 	 ly 	 	.

how	can	we	explain	 th 	 is 	 	 universal 	 ity 	 	?
the	best	answer	lies	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 construct 	 	a	darwinian	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	our	 art 	 istic 	 	and	aesthetic	 taste 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	reverse	-	engineer	our	present	 art 	 istic 	 	 taste 	 s 	 	and	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	and	explain	how	they	came	to	be	 engrav 	 ed 	 	in	our	 mind 	 s 	 	by	the	 action 	 s 	 	of	both	our	 pre 	 historic 	 	,	 large 	 ly 	 	 ple 	 ist 	 ocene 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	,	where	we	 be 	 came 	 	fully	human	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	by	the	social	 situ 	 ations 	 	in	which	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.

and	it	should	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	what	we	know	of	the	aesthetic	 interest 	 s 	 	of	 isolate 	 d 	 	hunter	-	gatherer	 band 	 s 	 	that	 surviv 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	19th	and	the	20th	centuries	.
now	,	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	have	no	doubt	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	that	the	experience	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	with	 it 	 s 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 intens 	 ity 	 	and	pleasure	,	 belong 	 s 	 	to	our	 evolv 	 ed 	 	human	 psycho 	 logy 	 	.
the	experience	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	one	component	in	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	darwinian	 adapt 	 ations 	 	.
 beaut 	 y 	 	is	an	 adapt 	 ive 	 	effect	,	which	we	extend	and	 intens 	 ify 	 	in	the	creation	and	 enjoy 	 ment 	 	of	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	and	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	know	,	evolution	 oper 	 ates 	 	by	two	main	 prim 	 ary 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	.
the	first	of	these	is	natural	 s 	 election 	 	--	that	's	random	mutation	and	 select 	 ive 	 	 re 	 tent 	 ion 	 	--	 a 	 long 	 	with	our	 bas 	 ic 	 	anatomy	and	physiology	--	the	evolution	of	the	 pan 	 cre 	 a 	 s 	 	or	the	eye	or	the	 finger 	 nail 	 s 	 	.
natural	 s 	 election 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 revuls 	 ions 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 horr 	 id 	 	smell	of	 rot 	 ting 	 	meat	,	or	 fear 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	fear	of	 snake 	 s 	 	or	 stand 	 ing 	 	close	to	the	edge	of	a	cliff	.
natural	 s 	 election 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	 pleasure 	 s 	 	--	sexual	pleasure	,	our	 lik 	 ing 	 	for	sweet	,	fat	and	 protein 	 s 	 	,	which	in	turn	 explain 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	popular	 food 	 s 	 	,	from	 rip 	 e 	 	 fruit 	 s 	 	through	chocolate	 mal 	 ts 	 	and	 barbecue 	 d 	 	 rib 	 s 	 	.
the	other	great	principle	of	evolution	is	sexual	 s 	 election 	 	,	and	it	 oper 	 ates 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
the	 pea 	 cock 	 	's	 magnific 	 ent 	 	tail	is	the	most	famous	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	did	not	evolve	for	natural	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
in	fact	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	against	natural	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
no	,	the	 pea 	 cock 	 	's	tail	 result 	 s 	 	from	the	 mat 	 ing 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	made	by	 peahen 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	familiar	story	.
it	's	women	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	push	 histo 	 ry 	 	forward	.
darwin	 him 	 self 	 	,	by	the	way	,	had	no	 doubt 	 s 	 	that	the	 pea 	 cock 	 	's	tail	was	 beaut 	 iful 	 	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	the	peahen	.
he	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	that	word	.
now	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	these	 idea 	 s 	 	 firm 	 ly 	 	in	mind	,	we	can	say	that	the	experience	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	one	of	the	ways	that	evolution	 ha 	 s 	 	of	 ar 	 ous 	 ing 	 	and	 sustain 	 ing 	 	interest	or	 fasci 	 nation 	 	,	even	obsession	,	in	order	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	us	 to 	 ward 	 	making	the	most	 adapt 	 ive 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	for	 surviv 	 al 	 	and	 re 	 production 	 	.
 beaut 	 y 	 	is	nature	's	way	of	 act 	 ing 	 	at	a	distance	,	so	to	speak	.
i	mean	,	you	ca	n't	expect	to	eat	an	 adapt 	 ively 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
it	would	 hard 	 ly 	 	do	to	eat	your	baby	or	your	lover	.
so	evolution	's	trick	is	to	make	them	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	to	have	them	exert	a	kind	of	 magnet 	 ism 	 	to	give	you	the	pleasure	of	 simpl 	 y 	 	looking	at	them	.
consider	 brief 	 ly 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	source	of	aesthetic	pleasure	,	the	 magnet 	 ic 	 	pull	of	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	.
people	in	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 culture 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	tend	to	like	a	 part 	 icular 	 	kind	of	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	that	just	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	similar	to	the	 ple 	 ist 	 ocene 	 	 savanna 	 s 	 	where	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 show 	 s 	 	up	 to 	 day 	 	on	 calendar 	 s 	 	,	on	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	,	in	the	design	of	golf	 course 	 s 	 	and	public	 park 	 s 	 	and	in	gold	-	 frame 	 d 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	that	hang	in	living	rooms	from	new	york	to	new	zealand	.

the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	,	are	often	 prefer 	 red 	 	if	they	 for 	 k 	 	near	the	ground	,	that	is	to	say	,	if	they	're	 tree 	 s 	 	you	could	scramble	up	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	tight	fix	.
the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	presence	of	water	 direct 	 ly 	 	in	view	,	or	evidence	of	water	in	a	 blu 	 ish 	 	distance	,	 indic 	 ations 	 	of	animal	or	bird	life	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	 green 	 ery 	 	and	 final 	 ly 	 	--	get	 th 	 is 	 	--	a	path	or	a	road	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	 river 	 bank 	 	or	a	 shore 	 line 	 	,	that	 extend 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	distance	,	 al 	 most 	 	 invit 	 ing 	 	you	to	follow	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	type	is	 regard 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	even	by	people	in	 count 	 ries 	 	that	do	n't	have	it	.
the	ideal	savanna	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	is	one	of	the	 clear 	 est 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	where	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	find	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	similar	visual	experience	.
but	,	 some 	 one 	 	might	 argu 	 e 	 	,	that	's	natural	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
how	about	 art 	 istic 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	?
is	n't	that	 exhaust 	 ively 	 	cultural	?
no	,	i	do	n't	think	it	is	.
and	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	look	back	to	 pre 	 histo 	 ry 	 	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
it	is	 wide 	 ly 	 	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	human	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	are	the	 stupendous 	 ly 	 	 skill 	 ful 	 	cave	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	we	all	know	from	lascaux	and	chauvet	.
chauvet	 cave 	 s 	 	are	about	32,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	a	few	small	,	realistic	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	of	women	and	 animal 	 s 	 	from	the	same	period	.
but	 art 	 istic 	 	and	 decor 	 ative 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	much	 old 	 er 	 	than	that	.
 beaut 	 iful 	 	shell	 neck 	 lace 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 some 	 thing 	 	you	'd	see	at	an	 art 	 s 	 	and	 craft 	 s 	 	fair	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	ochre	body	paint	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	found	from	around	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
but	the	most	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 historic 	 	 artifact 	 s 	 	are	 old 	 er 	 	even	than	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	have	in	mind	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	acheulian	hand	 axe 	 s 	 	.
the	 old 	 est 	 	stone	 tool 	 s 	 	are	 chop 	 per 	 s 	 	from	the	olduvai	gorge	in	east	africa	.
they	go	back	about	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	-	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
these	 crud 	 e 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	around	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	centuries	,	 un 	 til 	 	around	1.4	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 sha 	 ping 	 	single	,	thin	stone	 blade 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 round 	 ed 	 	 ov 	 al 	 s 	 	,	but	often	in	what	are	to	our	 eye 	 s 	 	an	 arrest 	 ing 	 	,	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	leaf	or	 tear 	 drop 	 	form	.
these	acheulian	hand	 axe 	 s 	 	--	they	're	named	after	st.	acheul	in	france	,	where	 find 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	made	in	19th	century	--	have	 be 	 en 	 	 un 	 earth 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	 scatter 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	europe	and	africa	,	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 where 	 	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	and	homo	 er 	 gas 	 ter 	 	 roam 	 ed 	 	.

and	some	,	in	any	event	,	are	too	big	to	use	for	 butcher 	 y 	 	.

so	what	 we 	 re 	 	these	ancient	--	i	mean	,	they	're	ancient	,	they	're	foreign	,	but	they	're	at	the	same	time	 some 	 how 	 	familiar	.
what	 we 	 re 	 	these	 artifact 	 s 	 	for	?
the	best	 avail 	 able 	 	answer	is	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	known	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	,	practical	 tool 	 s 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 captiv 	 ating 	 	aesthetic	 object 	 s 	 	,	 contempl 	 ated 	 	both	for	 the 	 ir 	 	elegant	shape	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 virtuos 	 o 	 	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 ship 	 	.

 ex 	 cept 	 	,	of	course	,	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	we	ca	n't	be	 s 	 ure 	 	how	that	idea	was	 convey 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	that	made	these	 object 	 s 	 	did	not	have	language	.
it	's	hard	to	grasp	,	but	it	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	fact	.
 th 	 is 	 	object	was	made	by	a	hominid	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	,	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	or	homo	 er 	 gas 	 ter 	 	,	between	50,000	and	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	before	language	.
