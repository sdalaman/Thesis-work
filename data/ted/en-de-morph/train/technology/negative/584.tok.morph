i	'm	going	to	talk	about	post	-	conflict	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	and	how	we	might	do	post	-	conflict	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	better	.
the	record	on	post	-	conflict	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	.
40	percent	of	all	post	-	conflict	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	have	 re 	 vert 	 ed 	 	back	to	conflict	 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	.
in	fact	,	they	've	 account 	 ed 	 	for	half	of	all	civil	 war 	 s 	 	.
why	 ha 	 s 	 	the	record	 be 	 en 	 	so	poor	?
well	,	the	 convention 	 al 	 	approach	to	post	-	conflict	 situ 	 ations 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 rest 	 ed 	 	on	,	on	kind	of	,	three	 principle 	 s 	 	.
the	first	principle	is	:	it	's	the	 politic 	 s 	 	that	 matter 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	first	thing	that	is	 priori 	 t 	 ized 	 	is	 politic 	 s 	 	.
try	and	build	a	 politic 	 al 	 	 settle 	 ment 	 	first	.
and	then	the	second	step	is	to	say	,	``	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	 admitted 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	for	a	short	time	.	``
so	get	 peace 	 keeper 	 s 	 	there	,	but	get	them	home	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
so	,	short	-	term	 peace 	 keeper 	 s 	 	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	what	is	the	exit	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	for	the	 peace 	 keeper 	 s 	 	?
it	's	an	election	.
that	will	produce	a	legitimate	and	 account 	 able 	 	government	.
so	that	's	the	 convention 	 al 	 	approach	.
i	think	that	approach	 deni 	 es 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
we	see	that	there	is	no	quick	fix	.
there	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	no	quick	security	fix	.
i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	the	 risk 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 version 	 	to	conflict	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	our	post	-	conflict	decade	.
and	the	 risk 	 s 	 	stay	high	 through 	 out 	 	the	decade	.
and	they	stay	high	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	an	election	produce	an	 account 	 able 	 	and	legitimate	government	?
what	an	election	 produce 	 s 	 	is	a	winner	and	a	 lose 	 r 	 	.
and	the	 lose 	 r 	 	is	unreconciled	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	we	need	to	reverse	the	sequence	.
it	's	not	the	 politic 	 s 	 	first	;	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 politic 	 s 	 	last	.
the	 politic 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	decade	 progress 	 es 	 	if	you	're	building	on	a	 found 	 ation 	 	of	security	and	economic	 develop 	 ment 	 	--	the	 re 	 building 	 	of	 prosper 	 ity 	 	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	the	 politic 	 s 	 	get	 eas 	 ier 	 	?
and	why	is	it	so	difficult	 initi 	 ally 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	after	 year 	 s 	 	of	 stag 	 nation 	 	and	decline	,	the	 ment 	 ality 	 	of	 politic 	 s 	 	is	that	it	's	a	zero	-	sum	game	.
if	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	 stag 	 nation 	 	,	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	go	up	if	you	go	down	.
and	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	produce	a	productive	 politic 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	 ment 	 ality 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	shift	from	zero	-	sum	to	positive	-	sum	before	you	can	get	a	productive	 politic 	 s 	 	.
you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	get	positive	,	that	mental	shift	,	if	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	 prosper 	 ity 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	built	.
and	in	order	to	build	 prosper 	 ity 	 	,	we	need	security	in	place	.
so	that	is	what	you	get	when	you	face	 re 	 ality 	 	.
but	the	 object 	 ive 	 	of	facing	 re 	 ality 	 	is	to	change	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	so	now	let	me	suggest	two	complimentary	 approach 	 es 	 	to	changing	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	the	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
the	first	is	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	of	three	key	 act 	 ors 	 	,	who	are	different	 act 	 ors 	 	,	and	at	the	moment	are	uncoordinated	.
the	first	 a 	 ctor 	 	is	the	security	council	.
the	security	council	 typical 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	the	 peace 	 keeper 	 s 	 	who	build	the	security	.
and	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 recogn 	 ized 	 	,	first	of	all	,	that	 peace 	 keep 	 ing 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
it	is	a	cost	-	effective	approach	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	security	.
but	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	long	-	term	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	a	decade	-	long	approach	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	's	one	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	the	security	council	.
the	second	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	different	cast	of	 guy 	 s 	 	,	is	the	 donor 	 s 	 	.
the	 donor 	 s 	 	provide	post	-	conflict	aid	.
 typical 	 ly 	 	in	the	past	,	the	 donor 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	first	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	got	 bor 	 ed 	 	.
they	 move 	 d 	 	on	to	some	other	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
post	-	conflict	economic	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	is	a	 s 	 low 	 	process	.
there	are	no	quick	 process 	 es 	 	in	 economic 	 s 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	decline	.
you	can	do	that	 quit 	 e 	 	fast	.
so	the	 donor 	 s 	 	have	to	stick	with	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	for	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	decade	.
and	then	the	third	key	 a 	 ctor 	 	is	the	post	-	conflict	government	.
and	there	are	two	key	 thing 	 s 	 	it	's	got	to	do	.
one	is	it	's	got	to	do	economic	reform	,	not	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 	about	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 constit 	 ution 	 	.
it	's	got	to	reform	economic	policy	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	conflict	economic	policy	 typical 	 ly 	 	 deterio 	 rates 	 	.
 government 	 s 	 	snatch	short	-	term	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	and	,	by	the	end	of	the	conflict	,	the	 chicken 	 s 	 	have	come	home	to	roost	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	conflict	is	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	economic	policy	.
so	there	is	a	reform	agenda	,	and	there	is	an	 in 	 clusion 	 	agenda	.
the	 in 	 clusion 	 	agenda	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	from	 election 	 s 	 	.
 election 	 s 	 	produce	a	 lose 	 r 	 	,	who	is	then	 exclude 	 d 	 	.
so	the	 in 	 clusion 	 	agenda	 mean 	 s 	 	 genuine 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	people	 in 	 side 	 	the	tent	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 act 	 ors 	 	.
and	they	are	 inter 	 dependent 	 	over	a	long	term	.
if	the	security	council	 do 	 es 	 	n't	commit	to	security	over	the	course	of	a	decade	,	you	do	n't	get	the	 re 	 assurance 	 	which	 produce 	 s 	 	private	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
if	you	do	n't	get	the	policy	reform	and	the	aid	,	you	do	n't	get	the	economic	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	,	which	is	the	true	exit	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	for	the	 peace 	 keeper 	 s 	 	.
so	we	should	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	by	 form 	 al 	 	,	mutual	 commit 	 ments 	 	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	language	for	these	mutual	 commit 	 ments 	 	,	the	 re 	 cognition 	 	of	mutual	 commit 	 ments 	 	;	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	language	of	compact	.
and	so	we	need	a	post	-	conflict	compact	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	even	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 age 	 ncy 	 	which	could	broker	these	compacts	;	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	peace	building	commission	.
it	would	be	ideal	to	have	a	standard	set	of	 norm 	 s 	 	where	,	when	we	got	to	a	post	-	conflict	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	there	was	an	 expect 	 ation 	 	of	these	mutual	 commit 	 ments 	 	from	the	three	 part 	 ies 	 	.
so	that	's	idea	one	:	and	now	let	me	turn	to	the	second	approach	,	which	is	complimentary	.
and	that	is	to	focus	on	a	few	critical	 object 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
typical	post	-	conflict	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	a	zoo	of	different	 act 	 ors 	 	with	different	 prior 	 ities 	 	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	 navig 	 ate 	 	by	 need 	 s 	 	you	get	a	 ver 	 y 	 	unfocused	agenda	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	these	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	 need 	 s 	 	are	 every 	 where 	 	,	but	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	implement	change	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
so	we	have	to	be	 discipline 	 d 	 	and	focus	on	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	critical	.
and	i	want	to	suggest	that	in	the	typical	post	-	conflict	 situ 	 ation 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	are	critical	.
one	is	 job 	 s 	 	.
one	is	 improve 	 ments 	 	in	 bas 	 ic 	 	 service 	 s 	 	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	health	,	which	is	a	disaster	 dur 	 ing 	 	conflict	.
so	 job 	 s 	 	,	health	,	and	clean	government	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	three	critical	 prior 	 ities 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	talk	a	little	about	each	of	them	.
 job 	 s 	 	.
what	is	a	 distinct 	 ive 	 	approach	to	generating	 job 	 s 	 	in	post	-	conflict	 situ 	 ations 	 	?
and	why	are	 job 	 s 	 	so	 import 	 ant 	 	?
 job 	 s 	 	for	whom	?	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 job 	 s 	 	for	young	men	.
in	post	-	conflict	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	the	reason	that	they	so	often	 re 	 vert 	 	to	conflict	,	is	not	 be 	 cause 	 	 elder 	 ly 	 	women	get	 up 	 set 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	young	men	get	 up 	 set 	 	.
and	why	are	they	 up 	 set 	 	?	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
and	so	we	need	a	process	of	generating	 job 	 s 	 	,	for	 ordin 	 ary 	 	young	men	,	fast	.
now	,	that	is	difficult	.
 government 	 s 	 	in	post	-	conflict	 situ 	 ation 	 	often	respond	by	 puff 	 ing 	 	up	the	civil	service	.
that	is	not	a	good	idea	.
it	's	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
in	fact	,	you	're	building	a	long	-	term	 li 	 ability 	 	by	 infla 	 ting 	 	civil	service	.
but	 get 	 ting 	 	the	private	sector	to	expand	is	 al 	 so 	 	difficult	,	 be 	 cause 	 	any	activity	which	is	open	to	 inter 	 national 	 	trade	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	going	to	be	uncompetitive	in	a	post	-	conflict	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
these	are	not	 environment 	 s 	 	where	you	can	build	export	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	one	sector	which	is	n't	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	 inter 	 national 	 	trade	,	and	which	can	generate	a	lot	of	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	which	is	,	in	any	case	,	a	 sens 	 ible 	 	sector	to	expand	,	post	-	conflict	,	and	that	is	the	construction	sector	.
the	construction	sector	 ha 	 s 	 	a	vital	role	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	in	 re 	 construction 	 	.
but	 typical 	 ly 	 	that	sector	 ha 	 s 	 	 with 	 er 	 ed 	 	away	 dur 	 ing 	 	conflict	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	conflict	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.
there	is	n't	any	construction	going	on	.	and	so	the	sector	shrivels	away	.
and	then	when	you	try	and	expand	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 shrivel 	 ed 	 	away	,	you	 en 	 counter 	 	a	lot	of	 bottle 	 neck 	 s 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 price 	 s 	 	soar	and	 crook 	 ed 	 	 politic 	 ians 	 	then	milk	the	rents	from	the	sector	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	generate	any	 job 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	policy	 prior 	 ity 	 	is	to	break	the	 bottle 	 neck 	 s 	 	in	 expand 	 ing 	 	the	construction	sector	.
what	might	the	 bottle 	 neck 	 s 	 	be	?
just	think	what	you	have	to	do	 success 	 fully 	 	to	build	a	structure	,	using	a	lot	of	labor	.
first	you	need	access	to	land	.
often	the	legal	system	is	broken	down	so	you	ca	n't	even	get	access	to	land	.
 second 	 ly 	 	you	need	 skill 	 s 	 	,	the	mundane	 skill 	 s 	 	of	the	construction	sector	.
in	post	-	conflict	 situ 	 ations 	 	we	do	n't	just	need	 doctor 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 border 	 s 	 	,	we	need	bricklayers	 with 	 out 	 	 border 	 s 	 	,	to	 re 	 build 	 	the	skill	set	.
we	need	 firm 	 s 	 	.	the	 firm 	 s 	 	have	gone	away	.
so	we	need	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	the	growth	of	local	 firm 	 s 	 	.
if	we	do	that	,	we	not	 on 	 ly 	 	get	the	 job 	 s 	 	,	we	get	the	 improve 	 ments 	 	in	public	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	the	 resto 	 ration 	 	of	public	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
let	me	turn	from	 job 	 s 	 	to	the	second	 object 	 ive 	 	,	which	is	 improv 	 ing 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	social	 service 	 s 	 	.
and	to	date	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	sort	of	a	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	in	the	donor	community	,	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	to	build	 bas 	 ic 	 	 service 	 s 	 	in	post	-	conflict	 sector 	 s 	 	.
on	the	one	hand	it	 pay 	 s 	 	lip	service	to	the	idea	of	 re 	 build 	 	an	effective	state	in	the	image	of	scandinavia	in	the	1950s	.
lets	develop	line	 mini 	 s 	 tries 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	,	and	the	other	,	that	deliver	these	 service 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	schizophrenic	 be 	 cause 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 heart 	 s 	 	 donor 	 s 	 	know	that	's	not	a	realistic	agenda	,	and	so	what	they	 al 	 so 	 	do	is	the	total	bypass	:	just	fund	ngos	.
 n 	 either 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 approach 	 es 	 	is	 sens 	 ible 	 	.
and	so	what	i	'd	suggest	is	what	i	call	 in 	 dependent 	 	service	 author 	 ities 	 	.
it	's	to	split	the	 function 	 s 	 	of	a	 monopol 	 y 	 	line	 mini 	 stry 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	three	.
the	 plan 	 ning 	 	function	and	policy	function	 stay 	 s 	 	with	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	;	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	 service 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	,	you	should	use	 what 	 ever 	 	 work 	 s 	 	--	 church 	 es 	 	,	ngos	,	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	in	between	,	there	should	be	a	public	 age 	 ncy 	 	,	the	 in 	 dependent 	 	service	 author 	 ity 	 	,	which	 channel 	 s 	 	public	money	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	donor	money	,	to	the	 re 	 tail 	 	 provide 	 rs 	 	.
so	the	ngos	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	a	public	government	system	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 in 	 dependent 	 	of	it	.
one	advantage	of	that	is	that	you	can	 al 	 locate 	 	money	coherently	.
 an 	 other 	 	is	,	you	can	make	ngos	 account 	 able 	 	.
you	can	use	yardstick	 com 	 petition 	 	,	so	they	have	to	compete	against	each	other	for	the	 resource 	 s 	 	.
the	good	ngos	,	like	oxfam	,	are	 ver 	 y 	 	keen	on	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
they	want	to	have	the	discipline	and	 account 	 ability 	 	.
so	that	's	a	way	to	get	 bas 	 ic 	 	 service 	 s 	 	 scale 	 d 	 	up	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	the	government	would	be	 fund 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	would	be	co	-	 brand 	 ing 	 	these	 service 	 s 	 	.
so	they	would	n't	be	 provide 	 d 	 	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	government	and	some	ngo	.
they	would	be	co	-	 brand 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	the	post	-	conflict	government	,	in	the	country	.
so	,	 job 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ic 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	clean	government	.
clean	 mean 	 s 	 	follow	 the 	 ir 	 	money	.
the	typical	post	-	conflict	government	is	so	short	of	money	that	it	 need 	 s 	 	our	money	just	to	be	on	a	life	-	support	system	.
you	ca	n't	get	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 function 	 s 	 	of	the	state	 d 	 one 	 	 un 	 less 	 	we	put	money	 in 	 to 	 	the	core	budget	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	,	if	we	put	money	 in 	 to 	 	the	core	budget	,	we	know	that	there	are	n't	the	budget	 system 	 s 	 	with	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	that	mean	that	money	will	be	well	 s 	 pent 	 	.
and	if	all	we	do	is	put	money	in	and	close	our	 eye 	 s 	 	it	's	not	just	that	the	money	is	 waste 	 d 	 	--	that	's	the	 l 	 east 	 	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	--	it	's	that	the	money	is	 capture 	 d 	 	.
it	's	 capture 	 d 	 	by	the	 crook 	 s 	 	who	are	at	the	heart	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	problem	.
and	so	 in 	 advert 	 ent 	 ly 	 	we	empower	the	people	who	are	the	problem	.
so	building	clean	government	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	provide	money	to	the	budget	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	provide	a	lot	of	 scru 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	technical	 assist 	 ance 	 	that	 follow 	 s 	 	the	money	.
 padd 	 y 	 	ashdown	,	who	was	the	grand	high	nabob	of	bosnia	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	in	his	book	about	his	experience	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 real 	 ize 	 	what	i	 need 	 ed 	 	was	 account 	 ants 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 border 	 s 	 	,	to	follow	that	money	.	``
so	that	's	the	--	let	me	wrap	up	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	package	.
what	's	the	goal	?
if	we	follow	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	would	we	hope	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	?
that	after	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	focus	on	the	construction	sector	would	have	 produce 	 d 	 	both	 job 	 s 	 	and	,	 h 	 ence 	 	,	security	--	 be 	 cause 	 	young	people	would	have	 job 	 s 	 	--	and	it	would	have	 re 	 construct 	 ed 	 	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
so	that	's	the	focus	on	the	construction	sector	.
the	focus	on	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	service	 deliver 	 y 	 	through	these	 in 	 dependent 	 	service	 author 	 ities 	 	would	have	 rescu 	 ed 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 service 	 s 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 level 	 s 	 	,	and	it	would	have	 give 	 n 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	the	sense	that	the	government	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
the	 emphas 	 is 	 	on	clean	government	would	have	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 squeez 	 ed 	 	out	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 crook 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	would	n't	be	any	money	in	taking	part	in	the	 politic 	 s 	 	.
