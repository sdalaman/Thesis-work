at	 bio 	 mimicry 	 	guild	,	which	is	my	 consult 	 ing 	 	company	,	we	work	with	hok	 architect 	 s 	 	.
we	're	looking	at	building	whole	cities	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 plan 	 ning 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	.
and	what	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	is	that	,	should	n't	our	cities	do	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 eco 	 system 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	native	 system 	 s 	 	that	they	replace	?
so	we	're	creating	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 logical 	 	performance	 standard 	 s 	 	that	hold	cities	to	 th 	 is 	 	 high 	 er 	 	bar	.
the	question	is	--	 bio 	 mimicry 	 	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	way	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	.
the	question	i	would	ask	is	,	``	what	's	worth	solving	?	``
if	you	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
dr.	adam	neiman	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 depict 	 ion 	 	of	all	of	the	water	on	earth	in	relation	to	the	volume	of	the	earth	--	all	the	ice	,	all	the	fresh	water	,	all	the	sea	water	--	and	all	the	atmosphere	that	we	can	breathe	,	in	relation	to	the	volume	of	the	earth	.
and	 in 	 side 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 ball 	 s 	 	life	,	over	3.8	billion	 year 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	lush	,	 liv 	 able 	 	place	for	us	.
and	we	are	in	a	long	,	long	line	to	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	planet	and	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	``	how	can	we	live	here	 grace 	 fully 	 	over	the	long	haul	?	``
how	can	we	do	what	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	do	?
which	is	to	create	 condition 	 s 	 	 con 	 duc 	 ive 	 	to	life	.
now	in	order	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	design	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	our	century	,	i	think	,	we	need	a	way	to	 re 	 mind 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	,	and	to	 some 	 how 	 	meet	them	 aga 	 in 	 	.
one	of	the	big	 idea 	 s 	 	,	one	of	the	big	 project 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 honor 	 ed 	 	to	work	on	is	a	new	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.	and	i	would	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	all	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	go	to	it	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	asknature.org	.
and	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	in	a	tedesque	way	,	is	to	organize	all	 bio 	 logical 	 	information	by	design	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	function	.
and	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	eol	,	encyclopedia	of	life	,	ed	wilson	's	ted	wish	.
and	he	's	 gather 	 ing 	 	all	 bio 	 logical 	 	information	on	one	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	are	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	eol	are	 answer 	 ing 	 	a	question	,	``	what	can	we	learn	from	 th 	 is 	 	organism	?	``
and	that	information	will	go	 in 	 to 	 	asknature.org	.
and	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	any	inventor	,	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	will	be	able	,	in	the	moment	of	creation	,	to	type	in	,	``	how	 do 	 es 	 	nature	 re 	 move 	 	salt	from	water	?	``
and	up	will	come	 man 	 grove 	 s 	 	,	and	sea	 turtle 	 s 	 	and	your	own	 kid 	 ney 	 s 	 	.
and	we	'll	begin	to	be	able	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	cody	 do 	 es 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	in	touch	with	these	 in 	 credible 	 	 model 	 s 	 	,	these	 elder 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	here	far	,	far	 long 	 er 	 	than	we	have	.
and	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	help	,	we	'll	learn	how	to	live	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	,	and	on	 th 	 is 	 	home	that	is	 our 	 s 	 	,	but	not	 our 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
