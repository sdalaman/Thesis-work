i	want	to	say	that	 re 	 ally 	 	and	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	after	these	 in 	 credible 	 	 speech 	 es 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	spread	,	i	am	in	the	awkward	position	of	 be 	 ing 	 	here	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
so	most	 every 	 one 	 	 watch 	 es 	 	tv	.
we	like	it	.	we	like	some	 part 	 s 	 	of	it	.
here	in	america	,	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	love	tv	.
the	average	american	 watch 	 es 	 	tv	for	 al 	 most 	 	5	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
now	i	happen	to	make	my	living	these	 day 	 s 	 	in	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	so	for	me	,	that	's	a	good	thing	.
but	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	love	it	so	much	.
they	,	in	fact	,	 ber 	 ate 	 	it	.
they	call	it	stupid	,	and	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	me	.
my	mother	,	growing	up	,	she	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	``	idiot	box	.	``
but	my	idea	 to 	 day 	 	is	not	to	debate	 whet 	 her 	 	there	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 a 	 s 	 	good	tv	or	bad	tv	;	my	idea	 to 	 day 	 	is	to	tell	you	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 science 	 	.
so	why	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 tele 	 vision 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 science 	 	is	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 tele 	 vision 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	 reflect 	 s 	 	the	moral	,	 politic 	 al 	 	,	social	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	need	 state 	 s 	 	of	our	nation	--	that	 tele 	 vision 	 	is	how	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	disseminate	our	entire	value	system	.
so	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	human	,	and	they	all	add	up	to	our	idea	of	 con 	 science 	 	.
now	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	good	and	bad	tv	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	popular	tv	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	top	-	10	nielsen	-	rated	 show 	 s 	 	over	the	course	of	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
how	do	these	nielsen	 rating 	 s 	 	reflect	not	just	what	you	've	heard	about	,	which	is	the	idea	of	our	social	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	 un 	 conscious 	 	,	but	how	do	these	top	-	10	nielsen	-	rated	 show 	 s 	 	over	50	 year 	 s 	 	reflect	the	idea	of	our	social	 con 	 science 	 	?
how	 do 	 es 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	evolve	over	time	,	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	say	about	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
now	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	evolution	,	from	 bas 	 ic 	 	biology	,	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	remember	that	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	have	four	 bas 	 ic 	 	 prim 	 al 	 	 instinct 	 s 	 	.
you	have	 hung 	 er 	 	;	you	have	 s 	 ex 	 	;	you	have	power	;	and	you	have	the	urge	for	 acquisit 	 ive 	 ness 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remember	is	that	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	we	've	 evolv 	 ed 	 	over	time	to	temper	,	or	tame	,	these	 bas 	 ic 	 	animal	 instinct 	 s 	 	.
we	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	laugh	and	cry	.
we	feel	awe	,	we	feel	 p 	 ity 	 	.
that	is	 separat 	 e 	 	and	 a 	 part 	 	from	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	.
the	other	thing	about	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	is	that	we	love	to	be	 entertain 	 ed 	 	.
we	love	to	watch	tv	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 clear 	 ly 	 	 separat 	 es 	 	us	from	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	.
 animal 	 s 	 	might	love	to	play	,	but	they	do	n't	love	to	watch	.
so	i	had	an	 ambit 	 ion 	 	to	discover	what	could	be	 under 	 stood 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	human	relationship	between	 tele 	 vision 	 	 program 	 s 	 	and	the	human	conscious	.
why	 ha 	 s 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	 entertain 	 ment 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	the	way	it	 ha 	 s 	 	?
i	kind	of	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cartoon	devil	or	angel	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	our	 shoulder 	 s 	 	.
is	 tele 	 vision 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 function 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	 con 	 science 	 	,	 tempt 	 ing 	 	us	and	 reward 	 ing 	 	us	at	the	same	time	?
so	to	begin	to	answer	these	 question 	 s 	 	,	we	did	a	research	 stud 	 y 	 	.
we	went	back	50	 year 	 s 	 	to	the	1959/1960	 tele 	 vision 	 	season	.
we	 survey 	 ed 	 	the	top	-	20	nielsen	 show 	 s 	 	every	year	for	50	 year 	 s 	 	--	a	thousand	 show 	 s 	 	.
we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	over	3,000	 individual 	 s 	 	--	 al 	 most 	 	3,600	--	aged	18	to	70	,	and	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	how	they	felt	 emotion 	 ally 	 	.
how	did	you	feel	 watch 	 ing 	 	every	single	one	of	these	 show 	 s 	 	?
did	you	feel	a	sense	of	moral	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	?
did	you	feel	 out 	 rage 	 	?	did	you	laugh	?
what	did	 th 	 is 	 	mean	for	you	?
so	to	our	global	ted	 audience 	 s 	 	,	i	want	to	say	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	u.s.	 s 	 ample 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	these	 emotion 	 al 	 	need	 state 	 s 	 	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	universal	.
and	on	a	factual	 bas 	 is 	 	,	over	80	percent	of	the	u.s.	's	most	popular	 show 	 s 	 	are	 export 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	.
so	i	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	our	global	 audience 	 s 	 	can	 re 	 late 	 	.
two	 acknowledg 	 ments 	 	before	our	first	data	slide	:	for	inspiring	me	to	even	think	about	the	idea	of	 con 	 science 	 	and	the	 trick 	 s 	 	that	 con 	 science 	 	can	play	on	us	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	,	i	thank	 legend 	 ary 	 	rabbi	,	jack	 ster 	 n 	 	.
and	for	the	way	in	which	i	'm	going	to	present	the	data	,	i	want	to	thank	ted	community	 super 	 star 	 	hans	rosling	,	who	you	may	have	just	 s 	 een 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	here	we	go	.
so	here	you	see	,	from	1960	to	2010	,	the	50	 year 	 s 	 	of	our	 stud 	 y 	 	.
two	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	going	to	start	with	--	the	inspiration	state	and	the	moral	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	state	,	which	,	for	 th 	 is 	 	purpose	,	we	defined	inspiration	 a 	 s 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	 up 	 lift 	 	me	,	that	make	me	feel	much	more	positive	about	the	world	.
moral	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	are	 tele 	 vision 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	in	which	i	do	n't	understand	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	right	and	wrong	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	start	,	you	see	in	1960	inspiration	is	 hold 	 ing 	 	 stead 	 y 	 	.
that	's	what	we	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	tv	for	.
moral	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	climb	.
right	at	the	end	of	the	60s	,	moral	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	is	going	up	,	inspiration	is	kind	of	on	the	 wan 	 e 	 	.
why	?
the	cuban	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	crisis	,	jfk	is	shot	,	the	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	race	 riot 	 s 	 	,	the	vietnam	war	,	mlk	is	shot	,	bobby	kennedy	is	shot	,	watergate	.
look	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
in	1970	,	inspiration	 plummet 	 s 	 	.
moral	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	 take 	 s 	 	off	.
they	cross	,	but	ronald	reagan	,	a	 tele 	 genic 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	,	is	in	 off 	 ice 	 	.
it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 cover 	 	.
but	look	,	it	ca	n't	:	 aid 	 s 	 	,	iran	-	contra	,	the	challenger	disaster	,	chernobyl	.
moral	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	meme	in	 tele 	 vision 	 	from	1990	for	the	next	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	chart	is	going	to	document	a	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	trend	.
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	have	comfort	--	the	bubble	in	red	--	social	 comment 	 ary 	 	and	 ir 	 reverence 	 	in	blue	and	green	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	time	on	tv	you	have	``	 bon 	 a 	 nza 	 	,	``	do	n't	forget	,	you	have	``	gunsmoke	,	``	you	have	``	andy	griffith	,	``	you	have	domestic	 show 	 s 	 	all	about	comfort	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ris 	 ing 	 	.	comfort	 stay 	 s 	 	whole	.
 ir 	 reverence 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	rise	.
social	 comment 	 ary 	 	is	all	of	a	sudden	 spi 	 king 	 	up	.
you	get	to	1969	,	and	look	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
you	have	comfort	,	 ir 	 reverence 	 	,	and	social	 comment 	 ary 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 batt 	 ling 	 	it	out	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	but	you	 liter 	 ally 	 	have	two	 establish 	 ment 	 	 show 	 s 	 	--	``	gunsmoke	``	and	``	gomer	pyle	``	--	in	1969	are	the	number	-	two	-	and	number	-	three	-	rated	 tele 	 vision 	 	 show 	 s 	 	.
what	's	number	one	?
the	 social 	 ly 	 	 ir 	 revere 	 nt 	 	 hip 	 pie 	 	show	,	``	rowan	and	martin	's	laugh	-	in	.	``
they	're	all	living	together	,	right	.
 view 	 ers 	 	had	 respond 	 ed 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	green	spike	in	1966	to	a	bellwether	show	.
when	you	 guy 	 s 	 	hear	 th 	 is 	 	industry	term	,	a	 break 	 out 	 	hit	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	in	the	1966	 tele 	 vision 	 	season	,	the	``	 s 	 mother 	 s 	 	 brother 	 s 	 	``	came	out	of	 no 	 where 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	show	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	 view 	 ers 	 	to	say	,	``	my	god	,	i	can	comment	on	how	i	feel	about	the	vietnam	war	,	about	the	 pre 	 side 	 ncy 	 	,	through	 tele 	 vision 	 	?	``
that	's	what	we	mean	by	a	 break 	 out 	 	show	.
so	then	,	just	like	the	last	chart	,	look	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
in	1970	,	the	dam	 burst 	 s 	 	.	the	dam	 burst 	 s 	 	.
comfort	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	why	we	watch	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
social	 comment 	 ary 	 	and	 ir 	 reverence 	 	rise	 through 	 out 	 	the	70s	.
now	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	70s	 mean 	 s 	 	who	?	norman	lear	.
you	have	``	all	in	the	family	,	``	``	sanford	and	son	,	``	and	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	show	--	in	the	top	-	10	for	the	entire	70s	--	``	m	*	a	*	s	*	h.	``
in	the	entire	50	 year 	 s 	 	of	 tele 	 vision 	 	that	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	,	seven	of	10	 show 	 s 	 	 rank 	 ed 	 	most	 high 	 ly 	 	for	 ir 	 reverence 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	on	air	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	vietnam	war	,	five	of	the	top	-	10	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	nixon	 administr 	 ation 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	one	generation	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	in	,	and	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	 w 	 ow 	 	!	tv	can	do	that	?
it	can	make	me	feel	 th 	 is 	 	?
it	can	change	us	?
so	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	savvy	crowd	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	note	the	digital	 folk 	 s 	 	did	not	invent	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	.
archie	 bunk 	 er 	 	was	 shove 	 d 	 	out	of	his	easy	chair	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	rest	of	us	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	quick	chart	.	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 attribut 	 e 	 	:	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	and	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	which	are	 show 	 s 	 	defined	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	 take 	 s 	 	me	out	of	my	 every 	 day 	 	realm	``	and	``	 make 	 s 	 	me	feel	better	.	``
that	's	 ma 	 pped 	 	against	the	red	dot	,	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	,	which	is	a	simple	bureau	of	labor	 depart 	 ment 	 	statistic	.
you	'll	see	that	every	time	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	and	 imagin 	 ation 	 	 show 	 s 	 	rise	,	it	 map 	 s 	 	to	a	spike	in	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
do	we	want	to	see	 show 	 s 	 	about	people	saving	money	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	?
no	.	in	the	70s	you	have	the	bellwether	show	``	the	 bio 	 nic 	 	woman	``	that	 rocket 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	top	-	10	in	1973	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	the	``	six	million	-	dollar	man	``	and	``	charlie	's	 angel 	 s 	 	.	``
 an 	 other 	 	spike	in	the	1980s	--	 an 	 other 	 	spike	in	 show 	 s 	 	about	control	and	power	.
what	 we 	 re 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 show 	 s 	 	?

so	here	you	are	,	in	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	chart	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	you	're	in	my	business	,	you	have	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	heard	or	read	of	the	decline	of	the	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	three	-	camera	sitcom	and	the	rise	of	 re 	 ality 	 	tv	.
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	say	in	the	business	,	x	 mark 	 s 	 	the	spot	.
the	90s	--	the	big	 bubble 	 s 	 	of	humor	--	we	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	``	 friend 	 s 	 	,	``	``	frasier	,	``	``	 cheer 	 s 	 	``	and	``	seinfeld	.	``
 every 	 thing 	 	's	good	,	low	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
but	look	:	x	 mark 	 s 	 	the	spot	.
in	2001	,	the	september	2001	 tele 	 vision 	 	season	,	humor	 succumb 	 s 	 	to	judgment	once	and	for	all	.
why	not	?
we	had	a	2000	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	election	 decide 	 d 	 	by	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	.

 an 	 thra 	 x 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	part	of	the	social	 lexic 	 on 	 	.

at	the	turn	of	the	century	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 take 	 s 	 	off	,	 re 	 ality 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	hold	.
what	do	people	want	in	 the 	 ir 	 	tv	then	?
i	would	have	thought	 re 	 venge 	 	or	nostalgia	.
give	me	some	comfort	;	my	world	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
no	,	they	want	judgment	.
