i	have	had	the	distinct	pleasure	of	living	 in 	 side 	 	two	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
of	course	we	all	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	live	in	 bio 	 sphere 	 	1	.
i	've	 al 	 so 	 	lived	in	 bio 	 sphere 	 	2	.
and	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	about	that	is	that	i	get	to	 compar 	 e 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
and	 hope 	 fully 	 	from	that	i	get	to	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	what	did	i	learn	?	well	,	here	i	am	 in 	 side 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	making	a	pizza	.
so	i	am	 harvest 	 ing 	 	the	wheat	,	in	order	to	make	the	dough	.
and	then	of	course	i	have	to	milk	the	 goat 	 s 	 	and	feed	the	 goat 	 s 	 	in	order	to	make	the	cheese	.
it	took	me	four	 month 	 s 	 	in	 bio 	 sphere 	 	2	to	make	a	pizza	.
here	in	 bio 	 sphere 	 	1	,	well	it	 take 	 s 	 	me	about	two	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	pick	up	the	phone	and	i	call	and	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	can	you	deliver	the	pizza	?	``
so	 bio 	 sphere 	 	2	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	three	-	acre	,	 entire 	 ly 	 	 seal 	 ed 	 	,	 miniatur 	 e 	 	world	that	i	lived	in	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	and	20	 minute 	 s 	 	.
over	the	top	it	was	 seal 	 ed 	 	with	steel	and	glass	,	 under 	 neath 	 	it	was	 seal 	 ed 	 	with	a	pan	of	steel	--	 essential 	 ly 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 seal 	 ed 	 	.
so	we	had	our	own	 miniatur 	 e 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 	,	a	private	beach	with	a	coral	reef	.
we	had	a	savanna	,	a	marsh	,	a	desert	.
we	had	our	own	half	-	acre	farm	that	we	had	to	grow	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	of	course	we	had	our	human	 habit 	 at 	 	,	where	we	lived	.
back	in	the	mid	-	'80s	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	we	had	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	what	is	a	 bio 	 sphere 	 	?
back	then	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	guess	we	all	know	now	that	it	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	sphere	of	life	around	the	earth	,	right	?
well	,	you	have	to	get	a	little	more	specific	than	that	if	you	're	going	to	build	one	.
and	so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	that	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	is	that	it	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	 material 	 ly 	 	closed	--	that	is	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	in	or	out	at	all	,	no	material	--	and	 energ 	 et 	 ically 	 	open	,	which	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	planet	earth	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	chamber	that	was	1/400th	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 bio 	 sphere 	 	2	that	we	 call 	 ed 	 	our	test	 modul 	 e 	 	.
and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	day	that	 th 	 is 	 	fellow	,	john	allen	,	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	,	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	in	there	with	all	the	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	and	bacteria	that	we	'd	put	in	there	to	 hope 	 fully 	 	keep	him	 al 	 ive 	 	,	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	that	he	was	going	to	succumb	to	some	 dread 	 ful 	 	toxin	,	or	that	his	 lung 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	get	 choke 	 d 	 	with	bacteria	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	fungus	.
but	of	course	 non 	 e 	 	of	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	over	the	 en 	 suing 	 	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	great	 s 	 aga 	 s 	 	about	 design 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	2	.
but	by	1991	we	 final 	 ly 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	thing	built	.
and	it	was	time	for	us	to	go	in	and	give	it	a	go	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	know	,	is	life	 th 	 is 	 	 malle 	 able 	 	?
can	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	on	a	planetary	scale	,	and	jam	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	bottle	,	and	will	it	 surviv 	 e 	 	?
big	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	 th 	 is 	 	both	for	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	go	 some 	 where 	 	else	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	go	to	mars	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	would	we	take	a	 bio 	 sphere 	 	with	us	,	to	live	in	it	?
we	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	so	we	can	understand	more	about	the	earth	that	we	all	live	in	.
well	,	in	1991	it	was	 final 	 ly 	 	time	for	us	to	go	in	and	try	out	 th 	 is 	 	baby	.
let	's	take	it	on	a	maiden	voyage	.
will	it	work	?	or	will	 some 	 thing 	 	happen	that	we	ca	n't	understand	and	we	ca	n't	fix	,	 there 	 by 	 	 neg 	 ating 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	man	-	made	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	?
so	eight	of	us	went	in	:	four	men	and	four	women	.
more	on	that	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	that	we	lived	in	.
so	,	on	the	top	,	we	had	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	and	an	ocean	,	and	 under 	 neath 	 	we	had	all	 th 	 is 	 	 techno 	 sphere 	 	,	we	 call 	 ed 	 	it	,	which	is	where	all	the	 pump 	 s 	 	and	the	 val 	 ves 	 	and	the	water	 tank 	 s 	 	and	the	air	 handler 	 s 	 	,	and	all	of	that	.
one	of	the	biospherians	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	garden	of	eden	on	top	of	an	 air 	 craft 	 	 car 	 rier 	 	.	``
and	then	 al 	 so 	 	we	had	the	human	 habit 	 at 	 	of	course	,	with	the	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	,	and	all	of	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
it	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	farm	.
the	day	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	i	was	,	for	the	first	time	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	atmosphere	than	 every 	 body 	 	else	in	the	world	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	seven	other	people	.
at	that	moment	i	 be 	 came 	 	part	of	that	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	mean	that	in	an	abstract	sense	;	i	mean	it	 ra 	 ther 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
when	i	 breath 	 ed 	 	out	,	my	co	2	fed	the	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	that	i	was	growing	.
and	we	ate	an	awful	lot	of	the	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	 be 	 came 	 	part	of	me	.
in	fact	,	we	ate	so	 man 	 y 	 	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	i	 be 	 came 	 	 o 	 range 	 	with	sweet	potato	.
i	 liter 	 ally 	 	was	eating	the	same	carbon	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	was	eating	 my 	 self 	 	in	some	strange	sort	of	bizarre	way	.
when	it	came	to	our	atmosphere	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	it	was	n't	that	much	of	a	joke	over	the	long	term	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	oxygen	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	oxygen	.
and	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	co	2	.
and	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	 sequest 	 er 	 	carbon	.
good	lord	--	we	know	that	term	now	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	growing	 plant 	 s 	 	like	crazy	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	taking	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 mass 	 	,	storing	them	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	,	growing	 plant 	 s 	 	,	going	around	,	around	,	around	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	all	of	that	carbon	out	of	the	atmosphere	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	stop	carbon	from	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	.
we	 stop 	 ped 	 	 irrig 	 ating 	 	our	 s 	 oil 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	.
we	 stop 	 ped 	 	 till 	 ing 	 	,	so	that	we	could	prevent	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	from	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	.
but	our	oxygen	was	going	down	 fast 	 er 	 	than	our	co	2	was	going	up	,	which	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	 s 	 een 	 	them	going	in	tandem	in	the	test	 modul 	 e 	 	.
and	it	was	like	 play 	 ing 	 	atomic	hide	-	and	-	seek	.
we	had	lost	seven	 ton 	 s 	 	of	oxygen	.
and	we	had	no	clue	where	it	was	.
and	i	tell	you	,	when	you	lose	a	lot	of	oxygen	--	and	our	oxygen	went	down	 quit 	 e 	 	far	;	it	went	from	21	percent	down	to	14.2	percent	--	my	 good 	 ness 	 	,	do	you	feel	 dread 	 ful 	 	.
i	mean	we	 we 	 re 	 	 drag 	 ging 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	around	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
and	we	had	sleep	apnea	at	night	.
so	you	'd	wake	up	 gasp 	 ing 	 	with	breath	,	 be 	 cause 	 	your	blood	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	that	you	 liter 	 ally 	 	do	that	.	you	stop	 breath 	 ing 	 	and	then	you	--	--	take	a	breath	and	it	 wake 	 s 	 	you	up	.	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 irrit 	 ating 	 	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	 out 	 side 	 	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
i	mean	,	the	media	was	making	it	sound	like	 we 	 re 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	had	to	call	up	my	mother	every	other	day	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	no	,	mum	,	it	's	fine	,	fine	.
we	're	not	dead	.	we	're	fine	.	we	're	fine	.	``
and	the	doctor	was	,	in	fact	,	 check 	 ing 	 	us	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	,	in	fact	,	fine	.
but	in	fact	he	was	the	person	who	was	most	susceptible	to	the	oxygen	.
and	one	day	he	could	n't	add	up	a	line	of	 figure 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	time	for	us	to	put	oxygen	in	.
and	you	might	think	,	well	,	``	boy	,	your	life	support	system	was	 fail 	 ing 	 	you	.	was	n't	that	 dread 	 ful 	 	?	``
 y 	 es 	 	.	in	a	sense	it	was	 terrify 	 ing 	 	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	could	walk	out	the	 air 	 lock 	 	door	at	any	time	,	if	it	 re 	 ally 	 	got	bad	,	 th 	 ough 	 	who	was	going	to	say	,	``	i	ca	n't	take	it	 any 	 more 	 	!	``	?
not	me	,	that	was	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.
but	on	the	other	hand	,	it	was	the	scientific	gold	of	the	project	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	 re 	 ally 	 	crank	 th 	 is 	 	baby	up	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientific	tool	,	and	see	if	we	could	,	in	fact	,	find	where	 t 	 hose 	 	seven	 ton 	 s 	 	of	oxygen	had	gone	.
and	we	did	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	find	it	.
and	we	found	it	in	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
 essential 	 ly 	 	it	had	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
we	had	put	too	much	carbon	in	the	 s 	 oil 	 	in	the	form	of	 com 	 post 	 	.
it	broke	down	;	it	took	oxygen	out	of	the	air	;	it	put	co	2	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	;	and	it	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	.
so	at	the	end	of	the	two	 year 	 s 	 	when	we	came	out	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 el 	 ated 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	fact	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	might	say	we	had	 discover 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 quit 	 e 	 	``	 uh 	 h 	 	,	``	when	your	oxygen	is	going	down	,	 stop 	 ped 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	in	your	life	support	system	,	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	failure	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	that	we	 k 	 new 	 	what	it	was	.	and	we	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	fix	it	.
and	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	 emerge 	 d 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	 a 	 s 	 	serious	 a 	 s 	 	that	.
and	we	 prov 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	,	more	or	less	.
people	,	on	the	other	hand	,	was	a	different	subject	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	--	 yea 	 h 	 	i	do	n't	know	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 fix 	 able 	 	.
we	all	went	 quit 	 e 	 	nuts	,	i	will	say	.
and	the	day	i	came	out	of	 bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	i	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	i	was	going	to	see	all	my	family	and	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
for	two	 year 	 s 	 	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	people	through	the	glass	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	ran	up	to	me	.
and	i	 re 	 coil 	 ed 	 	.	they	 s 	 tank 	 	!
people	stink	!
we	stink	of	 hair 	 spray 	 	and	 under 	 arm 	 	 deodo 	 rant 	 	,	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
now	we	had	stuff	 in 	 side 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	to	keep	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	clean	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	with	perfume	.
and	boy	do	we	stink	out	here	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	i	lost	touch	of	where	my	food	came	from	.
i	had	 be 	 en 	 	growing	all	my	own	food	.
i	had	no	idea	what	was	in	my	food	,	where	it	came	from	.
i	did	n't	even	 recogn 	 ize 	 	half	the	 name 	 s 	 	in	most	of	the	food	that	i	was	eating	.
in	fact	,	i	would	stand	for	 hour 	 s 	 	in	the	 aisle 	 s 	 	of	 shop 	 s 	 	,	 read 	 ing 	 	all	the	 name 	 s 	 	on	all	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	.
people	must	have	thought	i	was	nuts	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	lost	track	of	where	i	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	big	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	big	 bio 	 sphere 	 	that	we	all	live	in	.
in	 bio 	 sphere 	 	2	i	 total 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	i	had	a	huge	impact	on	my	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	 every 	 day 	 	,	and	it	had	an	impact	on	me	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 visceral 	 ly 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
so	i	went	about	my	business	:	paragon	space	 develop 	 ment 	 	corporation	,	a	little	firm	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	people	while	i	was	in	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	to	do	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	did	was	try	to	figure	out	:	how	small	can	you	make	these	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	,	and	what	can	you	do	with	them	?
and	so	we	 s 	 ent 	 	one	onto	the	mir	space	station	.
we	had	one	on	the	shuttle	and	one	on	the	 inter 	 national 	 	space	station	,	for	16	 month 	 s 	 	,	where	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	produce	the	first	 organism 	 s 	 	to	go	through	complete	 multi 	 ple 	 	life	 cycle 	 s 	 	in	space	--	 re 	 ally 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	the	 envelop 	 e 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	 malle 	 able 	 	our	life	 system 	 s 	 	are	.
and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	proud	to	announce	that	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	a	sneak	 pre 	 view 	 	--	on	friday	we	're	going	to	announce	that	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	a	team	to	develop	a	system	to	grow	 plant 	 s 	 	on	the	moon	,	which	is	going	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.
and	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	that	is	a	system	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	:	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	 seal 	 ed 	 	system	to	grow	 plant 	 s 	 	to	grow	on	mars	.
and	part	of	that	is	that	we	had	to	model	 ver 	 y 	 	rapid	 circul 	 ation 	 	of	co	2	and	oxygen	and	water	through	 th 	 is 	 	plant	system	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	 model 	 ing 	 	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	all	 place 	 s 	 	,	in	eritrea	,	in	the	horn	of	africa	.
eritrea	,	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	part	of	ethiopia	,	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	that	is	 astonish 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 star 	 k 	 	,	and	i	have	no	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	how	people	 e 	 ke 	 	out	a	living	there	.
it	is	so	dry	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	saw	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	what	i	saw	.
i	saw	a	company	that	had	taken	 sea 	 water 	 	and	sand	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	growing	a	kind	of	crop	that	will	grow	on	 pur 	 e 	 	salt	water	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	treat	it	.
and	it	will	produce	a	food	crop	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	was	 oil 	 seed 	 	.
it	was	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	producing	 man 	 grove 	 s 	 	in	a	 plant 	 ation 	 	.
and	the	 man 	 grove 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	wood	and	honey	and	 leav 	 es 	 	for	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	so	that	they	could	produce	milk	and	 what 	 not 	 	,	like	we	had	in	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
and	all	of	it	was	coming	from	 th 	 is 	 	:	shrimp	 farm 	 s 	 	.
shrimp	 farm 	 s 	 	are	a	 scour 	 ge 	 	on	the	earth	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	from	an	 environment 	 al 	 	point	of	view	.
they	pour	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 pollutant 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	pollute	 the 	 ir 	 	next	-	door	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
so	they	're	all	 s 	 hitting 	 	each	other	's	 pond 	 s 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	project	was	 do 	 ing 	 	was	taking	the	 ef 	 fluent 	 	of	these	,	and	 turn 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	food	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	 in 	 to 	 	abundance	for	a	desert	people	.
they	had	 create 	 d 	 	an	industrial	 eco 	 system 	 	,	of	a	sense	.
i	was	there	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 model 	 ing 	 	the	 man 	 grove 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	for	a	carbon	credit	program	,	under	the	u.n	.
kyoto	 proto 	 col 	 	system	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 model 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 man 	 grove 	 	swamp	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	how	do	you	put	a	box	around	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
when	i	'm	 model 	 ing 	 	a	plant	in	a	box	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	i	know	where	to	draw	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	.
in	a	 man 	 grove 	 	forest	like	 th 	 is 	 	i	have	no	idea	.
well	,	of	course	you	have	to	draw	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	around	the	whole	of	the	earth	.
and	understand	 it 	 s 	 	 interact 	 ions 	 	with	the	entire	earth	.
and	put	your	project	in	that	 con 	 text 	 	.
around	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	from	what	i	would	call	a	 bio 	 cidal 	 	species	,	one	that	--	 whet 	 her 	 	we	 intentional 	 ly 	 	or	 un 	 intentional 	 ly 	 	--	have	designed	our	 system 	 s 	 	to	kill	life	,	a	lot	of	the	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	photograph	,	is	in	fact	over	the	amazon	.
and	here	the	light	green	are	 area 	 s 	 	of	massive	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 wis 	 py 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	are	,	in	fact	,	 fire 	 s 	 	,	human	-	made	 fire 	 s 	 	.
we	're	in	the	process	of	 transform 	 ing 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	what	i	would	call	a	 bio 	 philic 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	one	where	we	learn	to	nurture	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
now	it	may	not	seem	like	it	,	but	we	are	.
it	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	in	every	kind	of	walk	of	life	,	and	every	kind	of	 care 	 er 	 	and	industry	that	you	can	think	of	.
and	i	think	often	 time 	 s 	 	people	get	lost	in	that	.
they	go	,	``	but	how	can	i	possibly	find	my	way	in	that	?
it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	huge	subject	.	``
and	i	would	say	that	the	small	stuff	 count 	 s 	 	.	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	story	of	a	rake	in	my	 back 	 yard 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	my	 back 	 yard 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	,	when	i	 b 	 ought 	 	my	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
and	in	arizona	,	of	course	,	 every 	 body 	 	 put 	 s 	 	 grave 	 l 	 	down	.
and	they	like	to	keep	 every 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 rak 	 ed 	 	.	and	they	keep	all	the	 leav 	 es 	 	away	.
and	on	sunday	 morn 	 ing 	 	the	 neighbor 	 s 	 	leaf	 blow 	 er 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	,	and	i	want	to	throttle	them	.
it	's	a	certain	type	of	aesthetic	.
we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	 un 	 tidi 	 ness 	 	.
and	i	threw	away	my	rake	.
and	i	let	all	of	the	 leav 	 es 	 	fall	from	the	 tree 	 s 	 	that	i	have	on	my	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
and	over	time	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	have	i	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	?
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	building	 top 	 s 	 oil 	 	.
and	so	now	all	the	 bird 	 s 	 	come	in	.	and	i	have	 hawk 	 s 	 	.
and	i	have	an	 oa 	 sis 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	every	spring	.	for	six	 week 	 s 	 	,	six	to	eight	 week 	 s 	 	,	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	flush	of	green	 oa 	 sis 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	a	 rip 	 arian 	 	area	.
and	all	of	tucson	could	be	like	 th 	 is 	 	if	 every 	 body 	 	would	just	revolt	and	throw	away	the	rake	.
the	small	stuff	 count 	 s 	 	.
the	industrial	revolution	--	and	prometheus	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	ability	to	light	up	the	world	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	ability	to	look	at	the	world	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
now	we	may	not	all	have	 an 	 other 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	that	we	can	run	to	,	and	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	 th 	 is 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
but	we	can	look	at	the	world	,	and	try	to	understand	where	we	are	in	 it 	 s 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	and	how	we	 choos 	 e 	 	to	interact	with	it	.
and	if	you	lose	where	you	are	in	your	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	or	are	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 difficult 	 y 	 	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	where	you	are	in	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	i	would	say	to	you	,	take	a	deep	breath	.
the	 yogi 	 s 	 	had	it	right	.
breath	 do 	 es 	 	,	in	fact	,	connect	us	all	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 al 	 	way	.
take	a	breath	now	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	breathe	,	think	about	what	is	in	your	breath	.
there	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	is	the	co	2	from	the	person	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	-	door	to	you	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	is	a	little	bit	of	oxygen	from	some	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	on	the	beach	not	far	from	here	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	us	in	time	.
there	may	be	some	carbon	in	your	breath	from	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
there	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	carbon	that	you	are	 exhal 	 ing 	 	now	that	will	be	in	the	breath	of	your	great	-	great	-	great	-	 grand 	 children 	 	.
thank	you	.
