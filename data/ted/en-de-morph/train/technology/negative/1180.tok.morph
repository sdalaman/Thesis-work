i	'd	like	to	begin	with	a	thought	experiment	.
imagine	that	it	's	4,000	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
 civil 	 ization 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 cease 	 d 	 	to	exist	--	no	 book 	 s 	 	,	no	 electron 	 ic 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	no	facebook	or	twitter	.
all	knowledge	of	the	english	language	and	the	english	 alpha 	 bet 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	lost	.
now	imagine	 archeo 	 logists 	 	 dig 	 ging 	 	through	the	 rub 	 ble 	 	of	one	of	our	cities	.
what	might	they	find	?
well	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	 rect 	 angular 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	plastic	with	strange	 symbol 	 s 	 	on	them	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	 circul 	 ar 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	metal	.
 may 	 be 	 	some	 cylindr 	 ical 	 	 contain 	 ers 	 	with	some	 symbol 	 s 	 	on	them	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	one	 archeo 	 logist 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	instant	 celebr 	 ity 	 	when	she	 discover 	 s 	 	--	buried	in	the	 hill 	 s 	 	 some 	 where 	 	in	north	america	--	massive	 version 	 s 	 	of	these	same	 symbol 	 s 	 	.
now	let	's	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	what	could	 s 	 uch 	 	 artifact 	 s 	 	say	about	us	to	people	4,000	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	no	hypothetical	question	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	kind	of	question	we	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	when	we	try	to	understand	the	indus	 val 	 ley 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	which	 exist 	 ed 	 	4,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	indus	 civil 	 ization 	 	was	 rough 	 ly 	 	contemporaneous	with	the	much	better	known	egyptian	and	the	mesopotamian	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	but	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	much	 large 	 r 	 	than	either	of	these	two	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
it	occupied	the	area	of	 approximate 	 ly 	 	one	million	square	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	 cover 	 ing 	 	what	is	now	pakistan	,	 north 	 western 	 	india	and	 part 	 s 	 	of	afghanistan	and	iran	.
 give 	 n 	 	that	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	vast	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	you	might	expect	to	find	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 rul 	 ers 	 	,	 king 	 s 	 	,	and	huge	 monument 	 s 	 	glorifying	these	 power 	 ful 	 	 king 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	what	 archeo 	 logists 	 	have	found	is	 non 	 e 	 	of	that	.
they	've	found	small	 object 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	these	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	one	of	these	 object 	 s 	 	.
well	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	replica	.
but	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	person	?
a	king	?	a	god	?
a	priest	?
or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	person	like	you	or	me	?
we	do	n't	know	.
but	the	indus	people	 al 	 so 	 	left	 be 	 hind 	 	 artifact 	 s 	 	with	writing	on	them	.
well	no	,	not	 piece 	 s 	 	of	plastic	,	but	stone	 seal 	 s 	 	,	 cop 	 per 	 	 table 	 ts 	 	,	 potter 	 y 	 	and	,	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	one	large	sign	board	,	which	was	found	buried	near	the	gate	of	a	city	.
now	we	do	n't	know	if	it	 say 	 s 	 	hollywood	,	or	even	bollywood	for	that	matter	.
in	fact	,	we	do	n't	even	know	what	any	of	these	 object 	 s 	 	say	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	indus	script	is	undeciphered	.
we	do	n't	know	what	any	of	these	 symbol 	 s 	 	mean	.
the	 symbol 	 s 	 	are	most	 common 	 ly 	 	found	on	 seal 	 s 	 	.
so	you	see	up	there	one	 s 	 uch 	 	object	.
it	's	the	square	object	with	the	 uni 	 corn 	 	-	like	animal	on	it	.
now	that	's	a	 magnific 	 ent 	 	piece	of	art	.
so	how	big	do	you	think	that	is	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	that	big	?
or	 may 	 be 	 	that	big	?
well	let	me	show	you	.
here	's	a	replica	of	one	 s 	 uch 	 	seal	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	one	inch	by	one	inch	in	 s 	 ize 	 	--	 pre 	 tty 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
so	what	 we 	 re 	 	these	used	for	?
we	know	that	these	 we 	 re 	 	used	for	 stamp 	 ing 	 	clay	 tag 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	 bundl 	 es 	 	of	 good 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	from	one	place	to	the	other	.
so	you	know	 t 	 hose 	 	 pack 	 ing 	 	 slip 	 s 	 	you	get	on	your	fedex	boxes	?
these	 we 	 re 	 	used	to	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 pack 	 ing 	 	 slip 	 s 	 	.
you	might	wonder	what	these	 object 	 s 	 	contain	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	text	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	they	're	the	name	of	the	 s 	 end 	 er 	 	or	some	information	about	the	 good 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	from	one	place	to	the	other	--	we	do	n't	know	.
we	need	to	decipher	the	script	to	answer	that	question	.
 decipher 	 ing 	 	the	script	is	not	just	an	intellectual	 puzzl 	 e 	 	;	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	question	that	's	 be 	 come 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	 intertwine 	 d 	 	with	the	 politic 	 s 	 	and	the	cultural	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	script	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	 battle 	 ground 	 	of	 sort 	 s 	 	between	three	different	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	.
first	,	there	's	a	group	of	people	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	passionate	in	 the 	 ir 	 	belief	that	the	indus	script	 do 	 es 	 	not	represent	a	language	at	all	.
these	people	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 symbol 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	the	kind	of	 symbol 	 s 	 	you	find	on	traffic	 sign 	 s 	 	or	the	 emblem 	 s 	 	you	find	on	 shield 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	second	group	of	people	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	indus	script	 represent 	 s 	 	an	indo	-	european	language	.
if	you	look	at	a	map	of	india	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	'll	see	that	most	of	the	 language 	 s 	 	spoken	in	north	india	belong	to	the	indo	-	european	language	family	.
so	some	people	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	indus	script	 represent 	 s 	 	an	ancient	indo	-	european	language	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	sanskrit	.
there	's	a	last	group	of	people	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	indus	people	 we 	 re 	 	the	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	of	people	living	in	south	india	 to 	 day 	 	.
these	people	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	indus	script	 represent 	 s 	 	an	ancient	form	of	the	dravidian	language	family	,	which	is	the	language	family	spoken	in	much	of	south	india	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	the	 proponent 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	point	to	that	small	pocket	of	dravidian	-	 s 	 peaking 	 	people	in	the	north	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	near	afghanistan	,	and	they	say	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	past	,	dravidian	 language 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	spoken	all	over	india	and	that	 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	the	indus	 civil 	 ization 	 	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	dravidian	.
which	of	these	 hypo 	 these 	 s 	 	can	be	true	?
we	do	n't	know	,	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	if	you	deciphered	the	script	,	you	would	be	able	to	answer	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
but	 decipher 	 ing 	 	the	script	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	task	.
first	,	there	's	no	rosetta	stone	.
i	do	n't	mean	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	;	i	mean	an	ancient	artifact	that	 contain 	 s 	 	in	the	same	text	both	a	known	text	and	an	 un 	 known 	 	text	.
we	do	n't	have	 s 	 uch 	 	an	artifact	for	the	indus	script	.
and	 further 	 more 	 	,	we	do	n't	even	know	what	language	they	spoke	.
and	to	make	 matter 	 s 	 	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	most	of	the	text	that	we	have	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	short	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	they	're	 usual 	 ly 	 	found	on	these	 seal 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
and	so	 give 	 n 	 	these	 for 	 mid 	 able 	 	 obstacle 	 s 	 	,	one	might	wonder	and	worry	 whet 	 her 	 	one	will	ever	be	able	to	decipher	the	indus	script	.
in	the	rest	of	my	talk	,	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	about	how	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	stop	 worry 	 ing 	 	and	love	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	posed	by	the	indus	script	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	the	indus	script	ever	since	i	read	about	it	in	a	middle	school	 text 	 book 	 	.
and	why	was	i	 fascinate 	 d 	 	?
well	it	's	the	last	major	undeciphered	script	in	the	ancient	world	.
my	 care 	 er 	 	path	led	me	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 computation 	 al 	 	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	,	so	in	my	day	job	,	i	create	computer	 model 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	to	try	to	understand	how	the	brain	 make 	 s 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	,	how	the	brain	 make 	 s 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	,	how	the	brain	 learn 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
but	in	2007	,	my	path	 cross 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	with	the	indus	script	.
that	's	when	i	was	in	india	,	and	i	had	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	meet	with	some	indian	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	using	computer	 model 	 s 	 	to	try	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	script	.
and	so	it	was	then	that	i	 real 	 ized 	 	there	was	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	me	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	with	these	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	so	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	at	that	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	'd	like	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	some	of	the	 result 	 s 	 	that	we	have	found	.
or	better	yet	,	let	's	all	 collect 	 ively 	 	decipher	.
are	you	ready	?
the	first	thing	that	you	need	to	do	when	you	have	an	undeciphered	script	is	try	to	figure	out	the	direction	of	writing	.
here	are	two	 text 	 s 	 	that	contain	some	 symbol 	 s 	 	on	them	.
can	you	tell	me	if	the	direction	of	writing	is	right	to	left	or	left	to	right	?
i	'll	give	you	a	couple	of	 second 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	right	to	left	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	?	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	left	to	right	?
oh	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	50/50	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
the	answer	is	:	if	you	look	at	the	left	-	hand	side	of	the	two	 text 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	notice	that	there	's	a	cramping	of	 sign 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	4,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	the	scribe	was	writing	from	right	to	left	,	they	ran	out	of	space	.
and	so	they	had	to	cram	the	sign	.
one	of	the	 sign 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	text	on	the	top	.
 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	the	direction	of	writing	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	from	right	to	left	,	and	so	that	's	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	we	know	,	that	 direction 	 ality 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	key	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 linguist 	 ic 	 	 script 	 s 	 	.
and	the	indus	script	now	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
what	other	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	language	 do 	 es 	 	the	script	show	?
 language 	 s 	 	contain	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
if	i	give	you	the	letter	q	and	ask	you	to	predict	the	next	letter	,	what	do	you	think	that	would	be	?
most	of	you	 s 	 aid 	 	u	,	which	is	right	.
now	if	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	to	predict	one	more	letter	,	what	do	you	think	that	would	be	?
now	there	's	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	.	there	's	e.	it	could	be	i.	it	could	be	a	,	but	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	b	,	c	or	d	,	right	?
the	indus	script	 al 	 so 	 	 exhibit 	 s 	 	similar	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	lot	of	text	that	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	diamond	-	shaped	symbol	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	in	turn	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 quota 	 tion 	 	 mark 	 s 	 	-	like	symbol	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	a	q	and	u	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	symbol	can	in	turn	be	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	these	fish	-	like	 symbol 	 s 	 	and	some	other	 sign 	 s 	 	,	but	never	by	these	other	 sign 	 s 	 	at	the	bottom	.
and	 further 	 more 	 	,	there	's	some	 sign 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	prefer	the	end	of	 text 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	jar	-	shaped	sign	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	sign	,	in	fact	,	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	the	most	 frequent 	 ly 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	sign	in	the	script	.
 give 	 n 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	here	was	our	idea	.
the	idea	was	to	use	a	computer	to	learn	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	and	so	we	 g 	 ave 	 	the	computer	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 text 	 s 	 	.
and	the	computer	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	 statistic 	 al 	 	model	of	which	 symbol 	 s 	 	tend	to	occur	together	and	which	 symbol 	 s 	 	tend	to	follow	each	other	.
 give 	 n 	 	the	computer	model	,	we	can	test	the	model	by	 essential 	 ly 	 	quizzing	it	.
so	we	could	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	 er 	 ase 	 	some	 symbol 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	ask	it	to	predict	the	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	.
here	are	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
you	may	regard	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	ancient	game	of	wheel	of	fortune	.
what	we	found	was	that	the	computer	was	 success 	 ful 	 	in	75	percent	of	the	 case 	 s 	 	in	 predict 	 ing 	 	the	correct	symbol	.
in	the	rest	of	the	 case 	 s 	 	,	 typical 	 ly 	 	the	second	best	guess	or	third	best	guess	was	the	right	answer	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	practical	use	for	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	procedure	.
there	's	a	lot	of	these	 text 	 s 	 	that	are	 damage 	 d 	 	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	one	 s 	 uch 	 	text	.
and	we	can	use	the	computer	model	now	to	try	to	complete	 th 	 is 	 	text	and	make	a	best	guess	 predict 	 ion 	 	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	symbol	that	was	 predict 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	try	to	decipher	the	script	by	generating	more	data	that	we	can	 analyz 	 e 	 	.
now	here	's	one	other	thing	you	can	do	with	the	computer	model	.
so	imagine	a	monkey	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	a	 key 	 board 	 	.
i	think	you	might	get	a	random	jumble	of	 letter 	 s 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 s 	 uch 	 	a	random	jumble	of	 letter 	 s 	 	is	 s 	 aid 	 	to	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 ent 	 ropy 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	physics	and	information	 theor 	 y 	 	term	.
but	just	imagine	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	random	jumble	of	 letter 	 s 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	ever	 s 	 pill 	 ed 	 	coffee	on	a	 key 	 board 	 	?
you	might	have	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 tuck 	 	-	key	problem	--	so	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	same	symbol	 be 	 ing 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	a	sequence	is	 s 	 aid 	 	to	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	 vari 	 ation 	 	at	all	.
language	,	on	the	other	hand	,	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 inter 	 mediate 	 	level	of	 ent 	 ropy 	 	;	it	's	 n 	 either 	 	too	rigid	,	nor	is	it	too	random	.
what	about	the	indus	script	?
here	's	a	graph	that	 plot 	 s 	 	the	entropies	of	a	whole	bunch	of	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	you	find	the	 uniform 	 ly 	 	random	sequence	,	which	is	a	random	jumble	of	 letter 	 s 	 	--	and	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	find	the	dna	sequence	from	the	human	genome	and	 instrument 	 al 	 	music	.
and	both	of	these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	which	is	why	you	find	them	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	high	range	.
at	the	lower	end	of	the	scale	,	you	find	a	rigid	sequence	,	a	sequence	of	all	a	's	,	and	you	 al 	 so 	 	find	a	computer	program	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	in	the	language	fortran	,	which	obeys	 re 	 ally 	 	strict	 rule 	 s 	 	.
 linguist 	 ic 	 	 script 	 s 	 	occupy	the	middle	range	.
now	what	about	the	indus	script	?
we	found	that	the	indus	script	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	range	of	the	 linguist 	 ic 	 	 script 	 s 	 	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	result	was	first	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	 high 	 ly 	 	controversial	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	people	who	raised	a	hue	and	cry	,	and	these	people	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	the	indus	script	 do 	 es 	 	not	represent	language	.
i	even	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	some	hate	mail	.
my	 student 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	i	should	 re 	 ally 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	consider	 get 	 ting 	 	some	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
who	'd	have	thought	that	 decipher 	 ing 	 	could	be	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	profession	?
what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	result	 re 	 ally 	 	show	?
it	 show 	 s 	 	that	the	indus	script	 share 	 s 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	of	language	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	old	 say 	 ing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	,	if	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 linguist 	 ic 	 	script	and	it	 act 	 s 	 	like	a	 linguist 	 ic 	 	script	,	then	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	may	have	a	 linguist 	 ic 	 	script	on	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
what	other	evidence	is	there	that	the	script	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	encode	language	?
well	 linguist 	 ic 	 	 script 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	encode	 multi 	 ple 	 	 language 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	here	's	the	same	sentence	written	in	english	and	the	same	sentence	written	in	dutch	using	the	same	 letter 	 s 	 	of	the	 alpha 	 bet 	 	.
if	you	do	n't	know	dutch	and	you	 on 	 ly 	 	know	english	and	i	give	you	some	 word 	 s 	 	in	dutch	,	you	'll	tell	me	that	these	 word 	 s 	 	contain	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
some	 thing 	 s 	 	are	not	right	,	and	you	'll	say	these	 word 	 s 	 	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	english	 word 	 s 	 	.
the	same	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	case	of	the	indus	script	.
the	computer	found	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 text 	 s 	 	--	two	of	them	are	 show 	 n 	 	here	--	that	have	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	the	first	text	:	there	's	a	 doub 	 ling 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	jar	-	shaped	sign	.
 th 	 is 	 	sign	is	the	most	 frequent 	 ly 	 	-	 occur 	 ring 	 	sign	in	the	indus	script	,	and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	text	that	it	 occur 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 doub 	 ling 	 	pair	.
why	is	that	the	case	?
we	went	back	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	where	these	 part 	 icular 	 	 text 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	found	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	found	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	far	away	from	the	indus	 val 	 ley 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	found	in	present	day	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	iran	.
and	why	 we 	 re 	 	they	found	there	?
what	i	have	n't	told	you	is	that	the	indus	people	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 enter 	 pri 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
they	used	to	trade	with	people	 pre 	 tty 	 	far	away	from	where	they	lived	,	and	so	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	by	sea	all	the	way	to	mesopotamia	,	present	-	day	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
and	what	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	is	that	the	indus	 trade 	 rs 	 	,	the	 merchan 	 ts 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	using	 th 	 is 	 	script	to	write	a	foreign	language	.
it	's	just	like	our	english	and	dutch	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
and	that	would	explain	why	we	have	these	strange	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 pattern 	 s 	 	you	see	in	the	text	that	are	found	 with 	 in 	 	the	indus	 val 	 ley 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	the	same	script	,	the	indus	script	,	could	be	used	to	write	different	 language 	 s 	 	.
the	 result 	 s 	 	we	have	so	far	seem	to	point	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	the	indus	script	 prob 	 ably 	 	 do 	 es 	 	represent	language	.
if	it	 do 	 es 	 	represent	language	,	then	how	do	we	read	the	 symbol 	 s 	 	?
that	's	our	next	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
so	you	'll	notice	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 symbol 	 s 	 	look	like	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	,	of	 insect 	 s 	 	,	of	 fish 	 es 	 	,	of	 bird 	 s 	 	.
most	ancient	 script 	 s 	 	use	the	rebus	principle	,	which	is	,	using	 picture 	 s 	 	to	represent	 word 	 s 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	here	's	a	word	.
can	you	write	it	using	 picture 	 s 	 	?
i	'll	give	you	a	couple	 second 	 s 	 	.
got	it	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	great	.
here	's	my	solution	.
you	could	use	the	picture	of	a	bee	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	a	picture	of	a	leaf	--	and	that	's	``	belief	,	``	right	.
there	could	be	other	 solution 	 s 	 	.
in	the	case	of	the	indus	script	,	the	problem	is	the	reverse	.
you	have	to	figure	out	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	each	of	these	 picture 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	that	the	entire	sequence	 make 	 s 	 	sense	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	like	a	 cross 	 word 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	mother	of	all	 cross 	 word 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	are	so	high	if	you	solve	it	.
my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	iravatham	mahadevan	and	asko	parpola	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	making	some	headway	on	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	problem	.
and	i	'd	like	to	give	you	a	quick	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	parpola	's	work	.
here	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	short	text	.
it	 contain 	 s 	 	seven	 vert 	 ical 	 	 stroke 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	fish	-	like	sign	.
and	i	want	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	these	 seal 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	used	for	 stamp 	 ing 	 	clay	 tag 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	 bundl 	 es 	 	of	 good 	 s 	 	,	so	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	that	these	 tag 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	some	of	them	,	contain	 name 	 s 	 	of	 merchan 	 ts 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	in	india	there	's	a	long	tradition	of	 name 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	based	on	horoscopes	and	star	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ations 	 	present	at	the	time	of	birth	.
in	dravidian	 language 	 s 	 	,	the	word	for	fish	is	``	meen	``	which	 happen 	 s 	 	to	sound	just	like	the	word	for	star	.
and	so	seven	 star 	 s 	 	would	stand	for	``	elu	meen	,	``	which	is	the	dravidian	word	for	the	big	dipper	star	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ation 	 	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	sequence	of	six	 star 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 transl 	 ates 	 	to	``	aru	meen	,	``	which	is	the	old	dravidian	name	for	the	star	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ation 	 	pleiades	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	other	 combination 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fish	sign	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	roof	on	top	of	it	.
and	that	could	be	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	``	mey	meen	,	``	which	is	the	old	dravidian	name	for	the	planet	saturn	.
so	that	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 some 	 where 	 	.
but	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	prove	that	these	 seal 	 s 	 	contain	dravidian	 name 	 s 	 	based	on	 planet 	 s 	 	and	star	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ations 	 	?
well	not	yet	.
so	we	have	no	way	of	 valid 	 ating 	 	these	 part 	 icular 	 	 read 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	if	more	and	more	of	these	 read 	 ing 	 s 	 	start	making	sense	,	and	if	 long 	 er 	 	and	 long 	 er 	 	 sequence 	 s 	 	appear	to	be	correct	,	then	we	know	that	we	are	on	the	right	track	.
we	can	write	a	word	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	ted	in	egyptian	hieroglyphics	and	in	cuneiform	script	,	 be 	 cause 	 	both	of	these	 we 	 re 	 	deciphered	in	the	19th	century	.
the	decipherment	of	these	two	 script 	 s 	 	enabled	these	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	to	speak	to	us	 aga 	 in 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
the	mayans	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	us	in	the	20th	century	,	but	the	indus	 civil 	 ization 	 	 remain 	 s 	 	silent	.
why	should	we	care	?
the	indus	 civil 	 ization 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	belong	to	just	the	south	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	or	the	north	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	or	the	pakistanis	;	it	 belong 	 s 	 	to	all	of	us	.
these	are	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	--	 your 	 s 	 	and	mine	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 silence 	 d 	 	by	an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	accident	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
if	we	decipher	the	script	,	we	would	 en 	 able 	 	them	to	speak	to	us	 aga 	 in 	 	.
what	would	they	tell	us	?
what	would	we	find	out	about	them	?	about	us	?
i	ca	n't	wait	to	find	out	.
thank	you	.
