rufus	griscom	:	now	i	think	of	our	story	 a 	 s 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.	av	:	that	's	true	.
rg	:	you	may	remember	,	we	fell	head	over	 heel 	 s 	 	in	love	.
av	:	we	did	.
rg	:	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	time	running	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	kind	of	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
it	was	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	nerve.com	,	the	 tag 	 line 	 	of	which	was	``	 liter 	 ate 	 	 s 	 mut 	 	.	``
it	was	in	 theor 	 y 	 	,	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	in	practice	,	a	smart	 on 	 line 	 	magazine	about	 s 	 ex 	 	and	culture	.
av	:	that	 spawn 	 ed 	 	a	 d 	 ating 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
but	you	can	understand	the	 joke 	 s 	 	that	we	get	.	 s 	 ex 	 	 be 	 get 	 s 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
you	follow	 instruct 	 ions 	 	on	nerve	and	you	should	end	up	on	 ba 	 bble 	 	,	which	we	did	.
and	we	might	launch	a	geriatric	 s 	 ite 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	third	.	we	'll	see	.
rg	:	but	for	us	,	the	 continu 	 ity 	 	between	nerve	and	 ba 	 bble 	 	was	not	just	the	life	stage	thing	,	which	is	,	of	course	,	relevant	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	more	about	our	 desir 	 e 	 	to	speak	 ver 	 y 	 	 honest 	 ly 	 	about	 subject 	 s 	 	that	people	have	 difficult 	 y 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	 honest 	 ly 	 	about	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	us	that	when	people	start	 dis 	 s 	 em 	 bling 	 	,	people	start	 ly 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	's	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	a	subject	that	we	want	to	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 to 	 	.
and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	find	,	 a 	 s 	 	young	 parent 	 s 	 	,	that	there	are	 al 	 most 	 	more	 taboo 	 s 	 	around	 parent 	 ing 	 	than	there	are	around	 s 	 ex 	 	.
av	:	it	's	true	.	so	like	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	early	 year 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	.
and	we	feel	like	some	of	that	 difficult 	 y 	 	was	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	false	 advertise 	 ment 	 	around	 parent 	 ing 	 	.
we	 sub 	 scribed 	 	to	a	lot	of	 magazine 	 s 	 	,	did	our	 home 	 work 	 	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	 every 	 where 	 	you	look	around	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 image 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	we	went	 in 	 to 	 	 parent 	 ing 	 	 expect 	 ing 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	 s 	 un 	 	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 stream 	 ing 	 	in	,	and	our	children	would	never	be	 cry 	 ing 	 	.
i	would	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 coiff 	 ed 	 	and	well	 rest 	 ed 	 	,	and	in	fact	,	it	was	not	like	that	at	all	.
rg	:	when	we	 lower 	 ed 	 	the	 gloss 	 y 	 	 parent 	 ing 	 	magazine	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	,	with	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 image 	 s 	 	,	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	scene	in	our	actual	living	room	,	it	 look 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
these	are	our	three	 son 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	they	're	not	 al 	 ways 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	,	but	with	three	 boy 	 s 	 	,	there	's	a	 de 	 cent 	 	 prob 	 ability 	 	that	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	of	them	will	not	be	 com 	 port 	 ing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	he	should	.
av	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	can	see	where	the	 dis 	 connect 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	for	us	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	like	what	we	went	in	 expect 	 ing 	 	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	,	and	so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	it	to	 parent 	 s 	 	straight	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	let	them	understand	what	the	 real 	 ities 	 	of	 parent 	 ing 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	an	honest	way	.
rg	:	so	 to 	 day 	 	,	what	we	would	love	to	do	is	share	with	you	four	 parent 	 ing 	 	 taboo 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	more	than	four	 thing 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	say	about	 parent 	 ing 	 	,	but	we	would	like	to	share	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	four	that	are	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	relevant	for	us	 personal 	 ly 	 	.
so	the	first	,	taboo	number	one	:	you	ca	n't	say	you	did	n't	fall	in	love	with	your	baby	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	minute	.
i	remember	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	in	the	hospital	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	process	of	giving	birth	to	our	first	child	.
av	:	we	,	or	i	?
rg	:	i	'm	sorry	.
 mis 	 use 	 	of	the	 pro 	 no 	 un 	 	.
alisa	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ously 	 	in	the	process	of	giving	birth	to	our	first	child	--	--	and	i	was	there	with	a	 catch 	 er 	 	's	mitt	.
and	i	was	there	with	my	 arm 	 s 	 	open	.
the	nurse	was	coming	at	me	with	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	child	,	and	i	remember	,	 a 	 s 	 	she	was	 approach 	 ing 	 	me	,	the	 voice 	 s 	 	of	 friend 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	the	moment	they	put	the	baby	in	your	 hand 	 s 	 	,	you	will	feel	a	sense	of	love	that	will	come	over	you	that	is	[	on	]	an	order	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	you	've	ever	 experience 	 d 	 	in	your	entire	life	.	``
so	i	was	bracing	 my 	 self 	 	for	the	moment	.
the	baby	was	coming	,	and	i	was	ready	for	 th 	 is 	 	mack	truck	of	love	to	just	knock	me	off	my	feet	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	,	when	the	baby	was	 place 	 d 	 	in	my	 hand 	 s 	 	,	it	was	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	moment	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	from	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	after	the	baby	was	 place 	 d 	 	in	my	 hand 	 s 	 	and	i	 br 	 ought 	 	him	over	.
and	you	can	see	,	our	 eye 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 g 	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	with	love	and	 affect 	 ion 	 	for	my	wife	,	with	deep	,	deep	 grat 	 itude 	 	that	we	had	what	 appear 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 health 	 y 	 	child	.
and	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	,	of	course	,	surreal	.
i	mean	,	i	had	to	check	the	 tag 	 s 	 	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	.
i	was	 inc 	 red 	 ul 	 ous 	 	,	``	are	you	 s 	 ure 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	child	?	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	all	 quit 	 e 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	.
but	what	i	felt	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	child	at	that	moment	was	deep	 affect 	 ion 	 	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	what	i	feel	for	him	now	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	so	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	here	that	is	 here 	 tic 	 al 	 	.
we	have	 chart 	 ed 	 	our	love	for	our	child	over	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	is	an	act	of	 here 	 s 	 y 	 	.
you	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	chart	love	.
the	reason	you	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	chart	love	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	of	love	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bin 	 ary 	 	thing	.
you	're	either	in	love	,	or	you	're	not	in	love	.
you	love	,	or	you	do	n't	love	.
and	i	think	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	love	is	a	process	,	and	i	think	the	problem	with	 think 	 ing 	 	of	love	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 bin 	 ary 	 	is	that	it	 cause 	 s 	 	us	to	be	 undul 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	that	love	is	 fraud 	 ulent 	 	,	or	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	,	or	what	have	you	.
and	i	think	i	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	here	to	the	father	's	experience	.
but	i	think	a	lot	of	men	do	go	through	 th 	 is 	 	sense	in	the	early	 month 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	first	year	,	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	is	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	in	some	fashion	.
av	:	well	,	i	'm	glad	rufus	is	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	up	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	notice	where	he	 dip 	 s 	 	in	the	first	 year 	 s 	 	where	i	think	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	most	of	the	work	.
but	we	like	to	joke	,	in	the	first	few	 month 	 s 	 	of	all	of	our	children	's	 live 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	uncle	rufus	.
rg	:	i	'm	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 affect 	 ion 	 ate 	 	uncle	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 affect 	 ion 	 ate 	 	uncle	.
av	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	and	i	often	joke	with	rufus	when	he	 come 	 s 	 	home	that	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	he	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	find	our	child	in	a	line	-	up	 among 	 st 	 	other	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
so	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	threw	a	pop	quiz	here	onto	rufus	.
rg	:	uh	oh	.
av	:	i	do	n't	want	to	embarrass	him	too	much	.	but	i	am	going	to	give	him	three	 second 	 s 	 	.
rg	:	that	is	not	fair	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	trick	question	.	he	's	not	up	there	,	is	he	?
av	:	our	eight	-	week	-	old	son	is	 some 	 where 	 	in	here	,	and	i	want	to	see	if	rufus	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	identify	him	.
rg	:	the	far	left	.	av	:	no	!
rg	:	cruel	.
av	:	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	to	be	 s 	 aid 	 	.
i	'll	move	on	to	taboo	number	two	.
you	ca	n't	talk	about	how	 lone 	 ly 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	baby	can	be	.
i	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	.	i	 love 	 d 	 	it	.
i	felt	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	community	around	me	.
i	felt	like	 every 	 one 	 	was	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	my	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	,	all	around	me	,	 track 	 ing 	 	it	down	till	the	actual	due	-	date	.
i	felt	like	i	was	a	vessel	of	the	future	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
that	 continu 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	the	hospital	.	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 exhila 	 rating 	 	.
i	was	shower	with	 gift 	 s 	 	and	 flower 	 s 	 	and	 visit 	 ors 	 	.
it	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	experience	,	but	when	i	got	home	,	i	 sudden 	 ly 	 	felt	 ver 	 y 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	shut	in	and	shut	out	,	and	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
i	did	expect	it	to	be	difficult	,	have	 sleep 	 less 	 	 night 	 s 	 	,	constant	 feed 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	i	did	not	expect	the	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 isol 	 ation 	 	and	 lone 	 lines 	 s 	 	that	i	 experience 	 d 	 	,	and	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	that	no	one	had	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	that	i	was	going	to	be	 feel 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
and	i	 call 	 ed 	 	my	sister	whom	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	--	and	had	three	children	--	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	,	``	why	did	n't	you	tell	me	i	was	going	to	be	 feel 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	that	i	was	going	to	have	these	--	 feel 	 ing 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	--	i	'll	never	forget	--	``	it	's	just	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	want	to	say	to	a	mother	that	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	baby	for	the	first	time	.	``
rg	:	and	of	course	,	we	think	it	's	 precise 	 ly 	 	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	should	be	 say 	 ing 	 	to	 mother 	 s 	 	who	have	 kid 	 s 	 	for	the	first	time	.
and	that	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	one	of	the	 theme 	 s 	 	for	us	is	that	we	think	that	 can 	 dor 	 	and	brutal	 honest 	 y 	 	is	critical	to	us	 collect 	 ively 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	great	 parent 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	hard	not	to	think	that	part	of	what	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 isol 	 ation 	 	is	our	modern	world	.
so	alisa	's	experience	is	not	 isolate 	 d 	 	.
so	your	58	percent	of	 mother 	 s 	 	 survey 	 ed 	 	report	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 lone 	 lines 	 s 	 	.
of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	67	percent	are	most	 lone 	 ly 	 	when	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	zero	to	five	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	zero	to	two	.
in	the	process	of	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	how	some	other	 culture 	 s 	 	around	the	world	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	period	of	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	here	in	the	western	world	,	less	than	50	percent	of	us	live	near	our	family	 member 	 s 	 	,	which	i	think	is	part	of	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	tough	period	.
so	to	take	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	among	 man 	 y 	 	:	in	southern	india	there	's	a	practice	known	 a 	 s 	 	 j 	 hol 	 ab 	 hari 	 	,	in	which	the	 pregn 	 ant 	 	woman	,	when	she	's	seven	or	eight	 month 	 s 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	 move 	 s 	 	in	with	her	mother	and	 go 	 es 	 	through	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 ritual 	 s 	 	and	 ceremoni 	 es 	 	,	give	birth	and	 return 	 s 	 	home	to	her	nuclear	family	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	after	the	child	is	born	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 man 	 y 	 	ways	that	we	think	other	 culture 	 s 	 	 off 	 set 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 lone 	 ly 	 	period	.
av	:	so	taboo	number	three	:	you	ca	n't	talk	about	your	 mis 	 carriage 	 	--	but	 to 	 day 	 	i	'll	talk	about	mine	.
so	after	we	had	declan	,	we	kind	of	 re 	 calibrate 	 d 	 	our	 expect 	 ations 	 	.
we	thought	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	could	go	through	 th 	 is 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	thought	we	 k 	 new 	 	what	we	would	be	up	against	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	that	i	was	able	to	get	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	and	i	soon	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	boy	,	and	then	when	i	was	five	 month 	 s 	 	,	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	we	had	lost	our	child	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	last	little	image	we	have	of	him	.
and	it	was	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	time	--	 re 	 ally 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	through	that	 mourn 	 ing 	 	process	,	i	was	 amaz 	 ed 	 	that	i	did	n't	want	to	see	 any 	 body 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	crawl	 in 	 to 	 	a	hole	,	and	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	how	i	was	going	to	work	my	way	back	 in 	 to 	 	my	 surround 	 ing 	 	community	.
and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	,	i	think	,	the	way	i	was	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	way	,	is	on	a	 re 	 ally 	 	deep	gut	level	,	i	was	 feel 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	shame	and	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	that	,	in	some	 respect 	 s 	 	,	i	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	at	 deliver 	 ing 	 	what	i	'm	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	to	do	.
and	of	course	,	it	made	me	question	,	if	i	was	n't	able	to	have	 an 	 other 	 	child	,	what	would	that	mean	for	my	marriage	,	and	just	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	woman	.
so	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	time	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	through	it	more	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 climb 	 ing 	 	out	of	that	hole	and	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	other	people	.
i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	by	all	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 start 	 ed 	 	 flood 	 ing 	 	in	.
people	i	 interact 	 ed 	 	with	 dai 	 ly 	 	,	 work 	 ed 	 	with	,	was	 friend 	 s 	 	with	,	family	 member 	 s 	 	that	i	had	known	a	long	time	,	had	never	 share 	 d 	 	with	me	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 st 	 ories 	 	.
and	i	just	remember	 feel 	 ing 	 	all	these	 st 	 ories 	 	came	out	of	the	 wood 	 work 	 	,	and	i	felt	like	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 th 	 is 	 	secret	 socie 	 ty 	 	of	women	that	i	now	was	a	part	of	,	which	was	 re 	 assur 	 ing 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 concern 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	think	,	 mis 	 carriage 	 	is	an	 in 	 visible 	 	loss	.
there	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	lot	of	community	support	around	it	.
there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	no	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	,	 ritual 	 s 	 	,	or	 rite 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	,	with	a	death	,	you	have	a	funeral	,	you	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	life	,	and	there	's	a	lot	of	community	support	,	and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	women	do	n't	have	with	 mis 	 carriage 	 	.
rg	:	which	is	too	bad	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	common	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 trauma 	 tic 	 	experience	.
fifteen	to	20	percent	of	all	 pregn 	 ancies 	 	result	in	 mis 	 carriage 	 	,	and	i	find	 th 	 is 	 	 astound 	 ing 	 	.
in	a	survey	,	74	percent	of	women	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 mis 	 carriage 	 	,	they	felt	,	was	 part 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	fault	,	which	is	awful	.
and	 astound 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	22	percent	 s 	 aid 	 	they	would	hide	a	 mis 	 carriage 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	spouse	.
so	taboo	number	four	:	you	ca	n't	say	that	your	average	happiness	 ha 	 s 	 	 decline 	 d 	 	since	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	child	.
the	party	line	is	that	every	single	 a 	 spect 	 	of	my	life	 ha 	 s 	 	just	gotten	 dramat 	 ically 	 	better	ever	since	i	 particip 	 ated 	 	in	the	miracle	that	is	 child 	 birth 	 	and	family	.
i	'll	never	forget	,	i	remember	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	,	our	first	son	,	declan	,	was	nine	 month 	 s 	 	old	,	and	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	on	the	couch	,	and	i	was	 read 	 ing 	 	daniel	gilbert	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	book	,	``	 s 	 tumbling 	 	on	happiness	.	``
and	i	got	about	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	way	through	,	and	there	was	a	chart	on	the	right	-	hand	side	--	on	the	right	-	hand	page	--	that	we	've	 label 	 ed 	 	here	``	the	most	 terrify 	 ing 	 	chart	 imagin 	 able 	 	for	a	new	parent	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	chart	is	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	of	four	 complete 	 ly 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 precipit 	 ous 	 	drop	of	marital	satisfaction	,	which	is	 close 	 ly 	 	 align 	 ed 	 	,	we	all	know	,	with	 broad 	 er 	 	happiness	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	rise	 aga 	 in 	 	 un 	 til 	 	your	first	child	 go 	 es 	 	to	college	.
so	i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	looking	at	the	next	two	 decade 	 s 	 	of	my	life	,	 th 	 is 	 	 cha 	 sm 	 	of	happiness	that	we	're	 driv 	 ing 	 	our	proverbial	 convert 	 ible 	 	straight	 in 	 to 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 desponde 	 nt 	 	.
av	:	so	you	can	imagine	,	i	mean	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	first	few	 month 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	difficult	,	but	we	'd	come	out	of	it	,	and	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	.
so	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	take	a	 deep 	 er 	 	look	at	it	in	 hope 	 s 	 	that	we	would	find	a	silver	lining	.
rg	:	and	that	's	when	it	's	great	to	be	running	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	for	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	got	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 report 	 er 	 	to	go	and	interview	all	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	 conduct 	 ed 	 	these	four	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	is	wrong	here	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	from	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
it	ca	n't	possibly	be	that	bad	.
so	liz	mitchell	did	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	job	with	 th 	 is 	 	piece	,	and	she	 interview 	 ed 	 	four	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	she	 al 	 so 	 	 interview 	 ed 	 	daniel	gilbert	,	and	we	did	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	find	a	silver	lining	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	guess	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	 th 	 is 	 	 base 	 line 	 	of	average	happiness	 argu 	 ably 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	 through 	 out 	 	life	.
average	happiness	is	,	of	course	,	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	speak	to	the	moment	-	by	-	moment	experience	,	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	think	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	when	you	layer	in	moment	-	to	-	moment	experience	.
and	so	we	all	remember	 a 	 s 	 	children	,	the	 tin 	 iest 	 	little	thing	--	and	we	see	it	on	the	 face 	 s 	 	of	our	children	--	the	 teen 	 iest 	 	little	thing	can	just	rocket	them	to	these	 height 	 s 	 	of	just	utter	 ad 	 ul 	 ation 	 	,	and	then	the	next	 teen 	 iest 	 	little	thing	can	cause	them	just	to	plummet	to	the	 depth 	 s 	 	of	despair	.
and	it	's	just	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	to	watch	,	and	we	remember	it	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 old 	 er 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	age	is	a	form	of	 lith 	 ium 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 old 	 er 	 	,	you	 be 	 come 	 	more	 s 	 table 	 	.
and	part	of	what	 happen 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	in	your	'20s	and	'30s	,	is	you	start	to	learn	to	 hedg 	 e 	 	your	happiness	.
you	start	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	could	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	live	music	event	and	have	an	 utter 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ing 	 	experience	that	will	cover	my	entire	body	with	 goose 	 bump 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	more	 like 	 ly 	 	that	i	'll	feel	 clau 	 stro 	 phobic 	 	and	i	wo	n't	be	able	to	get	a	beer	.
so	i	'm	not	going	to	go	.
i	've	got	a	good	stereo	at	home	.	so	,	i	'm	not	going	to	go	.	``
so	your	average	happiness	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	but	you	lose	 t 	 hose 	 	 transcend 	 ent 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	.
av	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	and	then	you	have	your	first	child	,	and	then	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 re 	 submit 	 	 your 	 self 	 	to	these	 high 	 s 	 	and	 low 	 s 	 	--	the	 high 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	first	 step 	 s 	 	,	the	first	 s 	 mile 	 	,	your	child	 read 	 ing 	 	to	you	for	the	first	time	--	the	 low 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	,	our	house	,	any	time	from	six	to	seven	every	night	.
but	you	 real 	 ize 	 	you	 re 	 submit 	 	 your 	 self 	 	to	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	control	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	,	which	we	think	 provide 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	meaning	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	and	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 grat 	 ifying 	 	.
rg	:	and	so	in	effect	,	we	trade	average	happiness	.
we	trade	the	sort	of	security	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	of	a	certain	level	of	 content 	 ment 	 	for	these	 transcend 	 ent 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	.
so	where	 do 	 es 	 	that	 leav 	 e 	 	the	two	of	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	family	with	our	three	little	 boy 	 s 	 	in	the	thick	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	factor	in	our	case	.
we	have	 viol 	 ated 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	taboo	in	our	own	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 bon 	 us 	 	taboo	.
av	:	a	quick	 bon 	 us 	 	taboo	for	you	,	that	we	should	not	be	 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	three	children	--	and	we	are	.
rg	:	and	we	had	 reservation 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	front	end	.
 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	you	should	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	work	with	your	spouse	.
in	fact	,	when	we	first	went	out	to	raise	money	to	start	 ba 	 bble 	 	,	the	venture	 capital 	 ists 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	 categor 	 ically 	 	do	n't	invest	in	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 found 	 ed 	 	by	 husband 	 s 	 	and	wives	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	an	extra	point	of	failure	.
it	's	a	bad	idea	.	do	n't	do	it	.	``
and	we	 obvious 	 ly 	 	went	forward	.	we	did	.
we	raised	the	money	,	and	we	're	 thrill 	 ed 	 	that	we	did	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	phase	of	one	's	life	,	the	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	scarce	resource	is	time	.
and	if	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	passionate	about	what	you	do	every	day	--	which	we	are	--	and	you	're	 al 	 so 	 	passionate	about	your	relationship	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	we	know	how	to	do	it	.
and	so	the	final	question	that	we	would	ask	is	:	can	we	 collect 	 ively 	 	bend	that	happiness	chart	 up 	 ward 	 s 	 	?
it	's	great	that	we	have	these	 transcend 	 ent 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	joy	,	but	they	're	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	quick	.
and	so	how	about	that	average	 base 	 line 	 	of	happiness	?
can	we	move	that	up	a	little	bit	?
av	:	and	we	kind	of	feel	that	the	happiness	gap	,	which	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	result	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 parent 	 ing 	 	--	and	 re 	 ally 	 	any	long	-	term	 partner 	 ship 	 	for	that	matter	--	with	the	wrong	 expect 	 ations 	 	.
and	if	you	have	the	right	 expect 	 ations 	 	and	 expect 	 ation 	 	management	,	we	feel	like	it	's	going	to	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 grat 	 ifying 	 	experience	.
rg	:	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	--	and	we	think	that	a	lot	of	 parent 	 s 	 	,	when	you	get	in	there	--	in	our	case	 any 	 way 	 	--	you	pack	your	 bag 	 s 	 	for	a	trip	to	europe	,	and	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	go	.
get	out	of	the	 air 	 plane 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	you	're	 trek 	 king 	 	in	nepal	.
and	 trek 	 king 	 	in	nepal	is	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	experience	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	if	you	pack	your	 bag 	 s 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	and	you	know	what	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	in	for	and	you	're	 psych 	 ed 	 	.
so	the	point	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	for	us	 to 	 day 	 	is	not	just	 hope 	 fully 	 	 honest 	 y 	 	for	the	sake	of	 honest 	 y 	 	,	but	a	hope	that	by	 be 	 ing 	 	more	honest	and	candid	about	these	 experience 	 s 	 	,	that	we	can	all	 collect 	 ively 	 	bend	that	happiness	 base 	 line 	 	up	a	little	bit	.
rg	+	av	:	thank	you	.
