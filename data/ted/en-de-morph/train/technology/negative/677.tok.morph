i	want	to	open	by	 quo 	 ting 	 	einstein	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	,	just	so	people	will	feel	at	ease	that	the	great	scientist	of	the	20th	century	 al 	 so 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	with	us	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 call 	 s 	 	us	to	 th 	 is 	 	action	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	is	a	part	of	the	whole	,	 call 	 ed 	 	by	us	,	the	'	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	'	--	a	part	 limit 	 ed 	 	in	time	and	space	.
he	 experience 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	,	his	 thought 	 s 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	the	rest	,	a	kind	of	optical	delusion	of	his	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	delusion	is	a	kind	of	 pri 	 son 	 	for	us	,	 restrict 	 ing 	 	us	to	our	personal	 desir 	 es 	 	and	to	 affect 	 ion 	 	for	a	few	 person 	 s 	 	 near 	 est 	 	to	us	.
our	task	must	be	to	free	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	by	 widen 	 ing 	 	our	circle	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	to	embrace	all	living	 creature 	 s 	 	and	the	whole	of	nature	in	 it 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	of	einstein	's	is	uncannily	close	to	that	of	buddhist	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	 where 	 in 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	--	``	karuna	,	``	it	is	 call 	 ed 	 	--	is	defined	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	the	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	's	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	the	 correspond 	 ing 	 	will	to	free	the	other	from	that	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.	``
it	 pair 	 s 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	with	love	,	which	is	the	will	for	the	other	to	be	happy	,	which	 requir 	 es 	 	,	of	course	,	that	one	 feel 	 s 	 	some	happiness	 one 	 self 	 	and	 wish 	 es 	 	to	share	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	perfect	in	that	it	 clear 	 ly 	 	 oppos 	 es 	 	self	-	centeredness	and	 self 	 ish 	 ness 	 	to	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	the	concern	for	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	,	further	,	it	 indic 	 ates 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	caught	in	the	cycle	of	self	-	concern	suffer	 help 	 lessly 	 	,	while	the	 com 	 passionate 	 	are	more	free	and	,	 im 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	,	more	happy	.
the	dalai	lama	often	 state 	 s 	 	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	his	best	friend	.
it	 help 	 s 	 	him	when	he	is	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	with	grief	and	despair	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	 help 	 s 	 	him	turn	away	from	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	his	 suffer 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	absolute	,	most	 terr 	 ible 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	 any 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	had	and	 broad 	 en 	 s 	 	his	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	the	 suffer 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	,	even	of	the	 perpet 	 rator 	 s 	 	of	his	 mis 	 ery 	 	and	the	whole	mass	of	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	 suffer 	 ing 	 	is	so	huge	and	enormous	,	his	own	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	less	and	less	 monument 	 al 	 	.
and	he	 begin 	 s 	 	to	move	beyond	his	self	-	concern	 in 	 to 	 	the	 broad 	 er 	 	concern	for	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 cheer 	 s 	 	him	up	,	 a 	 s 	 	his	courage	is	 stimul 	 ated 	 	to	rise	to	the	occasion	.
thus	,	he	uses	his	own	 suffer 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 door 	 way 	 	to	 widen 	 ing 	 	his	circle	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
he	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 col 	 league 	 	of	einstein	's	,	we	must	say	.
now	,	i	want	to	tell	a	story	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	story	in	the	indian	and	buddhist	tradition	,	of	the	great	saint	asanga	who	was	a	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	of	augustine	in	the	west	and	was	sort	of	like	the	buddhist	augustine	.
and	asanga	lived	800	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	buddha	's	time	.
and	he	was	discontented	with	the	state	of	people	's	practice	of	the	buddhist	 relig 	 ion 	 	in	india	at	that	time	.
and	so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	sick	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	.	 no 	 body 	 	's	 re 	 ally 	 	living	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	.
they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	love	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	,	but	they	are	 act 	 ing 	 	 self 	 ish 	 	and	pathetic	.
so	,	buddha	's	 teach 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	lost	 it 	 s 	 	 moment 	 um 	 	.
i	know	the	next	buddha	will	come	a	few	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	but	 exist 	 s 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	in	a	certain	heaven	``	--	that	's	maitreya	--	``	so	,	i	'm	going	to	go	on	a	 re 	 treat 	 	and	i	'm	going	to	meditate	and	pray	 un 	 til 	 	the	buddha	maitreya	 reveal 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	me	,	and	 give 	 s 	 	me	a	 teach 	 ing 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 rev 	 ive 	 	the	practice	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.	``
so	he	went	on	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 treat 	 	.	and	he	 meditate 	 d 	 	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	and	he	did	not	see	the	future	buddha	maitreya	.
and	he	left	in	disgust	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	he	was	 leav 	 ing 	 	,	he	saw	a	man	--	a	funny	little	man	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	sort	of	part	way	down	the	mountain	.
and	he	had	a	lump	of	iron	.
and	he	was	 rub 	 bing 	 	it	with	a	cloth	.
and	he	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	that	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	the	man	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	making	a	needle	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.	you	ca	n't	make	a	needle	by	 rub 	 bing 	 	a	lump	of	iron	with	a	cloth	.	``
and	the	man	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 re 	 ally 	 	?	``	and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	him	a	dish	full	of	 needle 	 s 	 	.
so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	get	the	point	.	``
he	went	back	to	his	cave	.	he	 meditate 	 d 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	no	vision	.	he	 leav 	 es 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	,	he	 come 	 s 	 	down	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	he	's	 leav 	 ing 	 	,	he	 s 	 ees 	 	a	bird	making	a	nest	on	a	cliff	ledge	.
and	where	it	's	 land 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	to	the	cliff	,	 it 	 s 	 	 feather 	 s 	 	 brush 	 es 	 	the	rock	--	and	it	had	cut	the	rock	six	to	eight	 inch 	 es 	 	in	.	there	was	a	 c 	 left 	 	in	the	rock	by	the	 brush 	 ing 	 	of	the	 feather 	 s 	 	of	 generation 	 s 	 	of	the	 bird 	 s 	 	.
so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	all	right	.	i	get	the	point	.	``	he	went	back	.
 an 	 other 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	no	vision	of	maitreya	after	nine	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 aga 	 in 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	time	:	water	 drip 	 ping 	 	,	making	a	giant	bowl	in	the	rock	where	it	 drip 	 s 	 	in	a	stream	.
and	so	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	he	 go 	 es 	 	back	.	and	after	12	 year 	 s 	 	there	is	still	no	vision	.
and	he	's	 freak 	 ed 	 	out	.	and	he	wo	n't	even	look	left	or	right	to	see	any	 encourag 	 ing 	 	vision	.
and	he	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	town	.	he	's	a	broken	person	.
and	there	,	in	the	town	,	he	's	 approach 	 ed 	 	by	a	dog	who	 come 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	one	of	these	 terr 	 ible 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	you	can	see	in	some	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	,	even	in	america	,	i	think	,	in	some	 area 	 s 	 	--	and	he	's	looking	just	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
and	he	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	dog	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	pathetic	,	and	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	attract	his	attention	.	and	he	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	down	looking	at	the	dog	.
and	the	dog	's	whole	 hind 	 quarter 	 s 	 	are	a	complete	open	sore	.
some	of	it	is	like	gangrenous	,	and	there	are	maggots	in	the	 fl 	 esh 	 	.	and	it	's	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
he	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	what	can	i	do	to	fix	up	 th 	 is 	 	dog	?
well	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	can	clean	 th 	 is 	 	wound	and	wash	it	.	``
so	,	he	 take 	 s 	 	it	to	some	water	.	he	's	about	to	clean	,	but	then	his	 aware 	 ness 	 	 focus 	 es 	 	on	the	maggots	.
and	he	 s 	 ees 	 	the	maggots	,	and	the	maggots	are	kind	of	looking	a	little	cute	.
and	they	're	maggoting	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	in	the	dog	's	 hind 	 quarter 	 s 	 	there	.
``	well	,	if	i	clean	the	dog	,	i	'll	kill	the	maggots	.	so	how	can	that	be	?
that	's	it	.	i	'm	a	 use 	 less 	 	person	and	there	's	no	buddha	,	no	maitreya	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	is	all	 hope 	 less 	 	.
and	now	i	'm	going	to	kill	the	maggots	?	``
so	,	he	had	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	idea	.
and	he	took	a	 s 	 hard 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	cut	a	piece	of	 fl 	 esh 	 	from	his	 t 	 high 	 	,	and	he	 place 	 d 	 	it	on	ground	.
he	was	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	too	 care 	 fully 	 	about	the	aspca	.
he	was	just	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	caught	with	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
so	he	thought	,	``	i	will	take	the	maggots	and	put	them	on	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	 fl 	 esh 	 	,	then	clean	the	dog	's	 wound 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	'll	figure	out	what	to	do	with	the	maggots	.	``
so	he	 start 	 s 	 	to	do	that	.	he	ca	n't	grab	the	maggots	.
 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	they	wriggle	around	.	they	're	kind	of	hard	to	grab	,	these	maggots	.
so	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	well	,	i	'll	put	my	tongue	on	the	dog	's	 fl 	 esh 	 	.
and	then	the	maggots	will	jump	on	my	 warm 	 er 	 	tongue	``	--	the	dog	is	kind	of	used	up	--	``	and	then	i	'll	 s 	 pit 	 	them	one	by	one	down	on	the	thing	.	``
so	he	 go 	 es 	 	down	,	and	he	's	 stick 	 ing 	 	his	tongue	out	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	he	had	to	close	his	 eye 	 s 	 	,	it	's	so	 disgust 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	smell	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	then	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	a	pfft	,	a	noise	like	that	.
he	 jump 	 s 	 	back	and	there	,	of	course	,	is	the	future	buddha	maitreya	in	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	vision	--	 rain 	 bow 	 	 light 	 s 	 	,	 gold 	 en 	 	,	 jewel 	 ed 	 	,	a	plasma	body	,	an	exquisite	mystic	vision	--	that	he	 s 	 ees 	 	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	.	``	he	bows	.
but	,	 be 	 ing 	 	human	,	he	's	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	his	next	 complain 	 t 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	he	 come 	 s 	 	up	from	his	first	bow	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	my	lord	,	i	'm	so	happy	to	see	you	,	but	where	have	you	 be 	 en 	 	for	12	 year 	 s 	 	?
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	maitreya	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	was	with	you	.	who	do	you	think	was	making	 needle 	 s 	 	and	making	 nest 	 s 	 	and	 drip 	 ping 	 	on	 rock 	 s 	 	for	you	,	 mis 	 ter 	 	dense	?	``
``	looking	for	the	buddha	in	person	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	did	n't	have	,	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	real	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
and	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	have	real	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	you	can	not	 recogn 	 ize 	 	love	.	``
``	maitreya	``	 mean 	 s 	 	love	,	``	the	loving	one	,	``	in	sanskrit	.
and	so	he	 look 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 dub 	 ious 	 	,	asanga	did	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	just	take	me	with	you	.	``
and	so	he	took	the	maitreya	--	it	shrunk	 in 	 to 	 	a	 glob 	 e 	 	,	a	ball	--	took	him	on	his	shoulder	.
and	he	ran	 in 	 to 	 	town	in	the	 market 	 place 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 re 	 jo 	 ice 	 	!	 re 	 jo 	 ice 	 	!
the	future	buddha	 ha 	 s 	 	come	 a 	 head 	 	of	all	 predict 	 ions 	 	.	here	he	is	.	``
and	then	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 throw 	 ing 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	and	 stone 	 s 	 	at	him	--	it	was	n't	 cha 	 utauqua 	 	,	it	was	some	other	town	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	saw	a	 de 	 ment 	 ed 	 	looking	,	scrawny	looking	yogi	man	,	like	some	kind	of	 hip 	 pie 	 	,	with	a	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	leg	and	a	 rot 	 ten 	 	dog	on	his	shoulder	,	 shout 	 ing 	 	that	the	future	buddha	had	come	.
so	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	they	 chase 	 d 	 	him	out	of	town	.
but	on	the	edge	of	town	,	one	 elder 	 ly 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	,	a	charwoman	in	the	charnel	ground	,	saw	a	 jewel 	 ed 	 	foot	on	a	 jewel 	 ed 	 	 lot 	 us 	 	on	his	shoulder	and	then	the	dog	,	but	she	saw	the	jewel	foot	of	the	maitreya	,	and	she	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	flower	.
so	that	 encourag 	 ed 	 	him	,	and	he	went	with	maitreya	.
maitreya	then	took	him	to	a	certain	heaven	,	which	is	the	typical	way	a	buddhist	myth	 un 	 fold 	 s 	 	.
and	maitreya	then	 ke 	 pt 	 	him	in	heaven	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	 dict 	 ating 	 	to	him	five	 complic 	 ated 	 	tomes	of	the	 method 	 ology 	 	of	how	you	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
and	then	i	thought	i	would	share	with	you	what	that	method	is	,	or	one	of	them	.
a	famous	one	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	 seven 	 fold 	 	 caus 	 al 	 	method	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	.	``
and	it	 begin 	 s 	 	first	by	one	 medit 	 ating 	 	and	 visual 	 izing 	 	that	all	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	with	one	--	even	 animal 	 s 	 	too	,	but	 every 	 one 	 	is	in	human	form	.
the	 animal 	 s 	 	are	in	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	human	 live 	 s 	 	.	the	 human 	 s 	 	are	human	.
and	then	,	among	them	,	you	think	of	your	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	the	circle	at	the	table	.
and	you	think	of	your	 ene 	 mies 	 	,	and	you	think	of	the	neutral	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	try	to	say	,	``	well	,	the	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	i	love	.
but	,	you	know	,	after	all	,	they	're	nice	to	me	.
i	had	 fight 	 s 	 	with	them	.	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	unfriendly	.
i	got	mad	.	 brother 	 s 	 	can	fight	.	 parent 	 s 	 	and	children	can	fight	.
so	,	in	a	way	,	i	like	them	so	much	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	nice	to	me	.
while	the	neutral	 one 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	know	.	they	could	all	be	just	fine	.
and	then	the	 ene 	 mies 	 	i	do	n't	like	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	mean	to	me	.
but	they	are	nice	to	 some 	 body 	 	.	i	could	be	them	.	``
and	then	the	buddhists	,	of	course	,	think	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	all	had	infinite	previous	 live 	 s 	 	,	we	've	all	 be 	 en 	 	each	other	's	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	all	of	you	,	in	the	buddhist	view	,	in	some	previous	life	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	do	n't	remember	it	and	 n 	 either 	 	do	i	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	my	mother	--	for	which	i	do	 apolog 	 ize 	 	for	the	trouble	i	 caus 	 ed 	 	you	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	your	mother	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	female	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	every	single	one	of	 your 	 s 	 	'	mother	in	a	previous	life	,	the	way	the	buddhists	reflect	.
so	,	my	mother	in	 th 	 is 	 	life	is	 re 	 ally 	 	great	.	but	all	of	you	in	a	way	are	part	of	the	 e 	 ternal 	 	mother	.
you	 g 	 ave 	 	me	that	 express 	 ion 	 	;	``	the	 e 	 ternal 	 	mama	,	``	you	 s 	 aid 	 	.	that	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
so	,	that	's	the	way	the	buddhists	do	it	.
a	theist	christian	can	think	that	all	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	even	my	 ene 	 mies 	 	,	are	god	's	children	.
so	,	in	that	sense	,	we	're	related	.
so	,	they	first	create	 th 	 is 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	of	 e 	 quality 	 	.
so	,	we	sort	of	 reduc 	 e 	 	a	little	of	the	 cl 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	love	--	just	in	the	 medit 	 ation 	 	--	and	we	open	our	mind	to	 t 	 hose 	 	we	do	n't	know	.
and	we	 definite 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 hostil 	 ity 	 	and	the	``	i	do	n't	want	to	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	to	them	``	to	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	the	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	hate	and	we	do	n't	like	.
and	we	do	n't	hate	 any 	 one 	 	,	 there 	 fore 	 	.	so	we	 equal 	 ize 	 	.	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	then	the	next	thing	we	do	is	what	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	mother	 re 	 cognition 	 	.	``
and	that	is	,	we	think	of	every	 be 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	familiar	,	 a 	 s 	 	family	.
we	expand	.	we	take	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	about	 remember 	 ing 	 	a	mama	,	and	we	defuse	that	to	all	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 medit 	 ation 	 	.
and	we	see	the	mother	in	every	 be 	 ing 	 	.
we	see	that	look	that	the	mother	 ha 	 s 	 	on	her	face	,	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	child	that	is	a	miracle	that	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	from	her	own	body	,	 be 	 ing 	 	a	mammal	,	where	she	 ha 	 s 	 	true	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	is	the	other	,	and	 ident 	 ifies 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
often	the	life	of	that	other	will	be	more	 import 	 ant 	 	to	her	than	her	own	life	.
and	that	's	why	it	's	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	form	of	 al 	 truism 	 	.
the	mother	is	the	model	of	all	 al 	 truism 	 	for	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	in	spiritual	 tradition 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	we	reflect	 un 	 til 	 	we	can	sort	of	see	that	motherly	 express 	 ion 	 	in	all	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
people	laugh	at	me	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	i	used	to	say	that	i	used	to	meditate	on	mama	cheney	 a 	 s 	 	my	mom	,	when	,	of	course	,	i	was	 annoy 	 ed 	 	with	him	about	all	of	his	 e 	 vil 	 	 do 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
i	used	to	meditate	on	george	bush	.	he	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	cute	mom	in	a	female	form	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	his	little	 ear 	 s 	 	and	he	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	and	he	 rock 	 s 	 	you	in	his	 arm 	 s 	 	.
and	you	think	of	him	 a 	 s 	 	 nurs 	 ing 	 	you	.
and	then	saddam	hussein	's	serious	 must 	 ache 	 	is	a	problem	,	but	you	think	of	him	 a 	 s 	 	a	mom	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	you	do	it	.	you	take	any	 be 	 ing 	 	who	 look 	 s 	 	weird	to	you	,	and	you	see	how	they	could	be	familiar	to	you	.
and	you	do	that	for	a	while	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	that	.
you	can	feel	the	 familiar 	 ity 	 	of	all	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	alien	.	they	're	not	``	other	.	``
you	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 other 	 ness 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
then	you	move	from	there	to	 remember 	 ing 	 	the	 kind 	 ness 	 	of	 mother 	 s 	 	in	general	,	if	you	can	remember	the	 kind 	 ness 	 	of	your	own	mother	,	if	you	can	remember	the	 kind 	 ness 	 	of	your	spouse	,	or	,	if	you	are	a	mother	 your 	 self 	 	,	how	you	 we 	 re 	 	with	your	children	.
and	you	begin	to	get	 ver 	 y 	 	 sentiment 	 al 	 	;	you	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	sentimentality	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	.
you	will	even	weep	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	with	 grat 	 itude 	 	and	 kind 	 ness 	 	.
and	then	you	connect	that	with	your	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	that	motherly	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
every	 be 	 ing 	 	,	even	the	most	mean	looking	 one 	 s 	 	,	can	be	motherly	.
and	then	,	third	,	you	step	from	there	to	what	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 grat 	 itude 	 	.	``
you	want	to	 re 	 pay 	 	that	 kind 	 ness 	 	that	all	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	to	you	.
and	then	the	fourth	step	,	you	go	to	what	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 love 	 ly 	 	love	.	``
in	each	one	of	these	you	can	take	some	 week 	 s 	 	,	or	 month 	 s 	 	,	or	 day 	 s 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	you	do	it	,	or	you	can	do	them	in	a	run	,	 th 	 is 	 	 medit 	 ation 	 	.
and	then	you	think	of	how	 love 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	when	they	are	happy	,	when	they	are	satisfied	.
and	every	 be 	 ing 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	when	they	are	 internal 	 ly 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	a	happiness	.
 the 	 ir 	 	face	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	when	they	're	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	they	look	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	every	 be 	 ing 	 	,	but	when	they	're	happy	they	look	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	so	you	see	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	potential	happiness	.
and	you	feel	a	love	 to 	 ward 	 	them	and	you	want	them	to	be	happy	,	even	the	 ene 	 my 	 	.
we	think	jesus	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 un 	 realistic 	 	when	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	love	 th 	 ine 	 	 ene 	 my 	 	.	``
he	 do 	 es 	 	say	that	,	and	we	think	he	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 un 	 realistic 	 	and	sort	of	spiritual	and	highfalutin	.	``	nice	for	him	to	say	it	,	but	i	ca	n't	do	that	.	``
but	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	practical	.
if	you	love	your	 ene 	 my 	 	that	 mean 	 s 	 	you	want	your	 ene 	 my 	 	to	be	happy	.
if	your	 ene 	 my 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	,	why	would	they	 both 	 er 	 	to	be	your	 ene 	 my 	 	?
how	 bor 	 ing 	 	to	run	around	chasing	you	.
they	would	be	 relax 	 ing 	 	 some 	 where 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	good	time	.
so	it	 make 	 s 	 	sense	to	want	your	 ene 	 my 	 	to	be	happy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	'll	stop	 be 	 ing 	 	your	 ene 	 my 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	too	much	trouble	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	that	's	the	``	 love 	 ly 	 	love	.	``	and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	fifth	step	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	``	universal	 compass 	 ion 	 	.	``
and	that	is	where	you	then	look	at	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	all	the	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	you	can	think	of	.
and	you	look	at	them	,	and	you	see	how	they	are	.
and	you	 real 	 ize 	 	how	 un 	 happy 	 	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	,	most	of	the	time	.
you	see	that	 fur 	 row 	 ed 	 	brow	in	people	.
and	then	you	 real 	 ize 	 	they	do	n't	even	have	 compass 	 ion 	 	on	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	're	driven	by	 th 	 is 	 	duty	and	 th 	 is 	 	 oblig 	 ation 	 	.
``	i	have	to	get	that	.	i	need	more	.	i	'm	not	worthy	.	and	i	should	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.	``
and	they	're	 rush 	 ing 	 	around	all	 stress 	 ed 	 	out	.
and	they	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 how 	 	 ma 	 cho 	 	,	hard	discipline	on	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	they	are	cruel	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	,	of	course	,	they	are	cruel	and	 ruth 	 less 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	they	,	then	,	never	get	any	positive	 feed 	 back 	 	.
and	the	more	they	succeed	and	the	more	power	they	have	,	the	more	 un 	 happy 	 	they	are	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	feel	real	 compass 	 ion 	 	for	them	.
and	you	then	feel	you	must	act	.
and	the	choice	of	the	action	,	of	course	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	will	be	more	practical	than	poor	asanga	,	who	was	 fix 	 ing 	 	the	maggots	on	the	dog	 be 	 cause 	 	he	had	that	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	and	 who 	 ever 	 	was	in	front	of	him	,	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	help	.
but	,	of	course	,	that	is	 im 	 practical 	 	.	he	should	have	 found 	 ed 	 	the	aspca	in	the	town	and	gotten	some	scientific	help	for	 dog 	 s 	 	and	maggots	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	he	did	that	 lat 	 er 	 	.	but	that	just	 indic 	 ates 	 	the	state	of	mind	,	you	know	.
and	so	the	next	step	--	the	sixth	step	beyond	``	universal	 compass 	 ion 	 	``	--	is	 th 	 is 	 	thing	where	you	're	linked	with	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	in	a	true	way	,	and	you	have	 compass 	 ion 	 	for	 your 	 self 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	and	it	is	n't	 sentiment 	 al 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	.	you	might	be	in	fear	of	 some 	 thing 	 	.
some	bad	guy	is	making	 him 	 self 	 	more	and	more	 un 	 happy 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	mean	to	other	people	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 punish 	 ed 	 	in	the	future	for	it	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	ways	.
and	in	buddhism	,	they	catch	it	in	the	future	life	.
of	course	in	theistic	 relig 	 ion 	 	they	're	 punish 	 ed 	 	by	god	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	 material 	 ism 	 	,	they	think	they	get	out	of	it	just	by	not	 exist 	 ing 	 	,	by	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	but	they	do	n't	.
and	so	they	get	 re 	 born 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	,	you	know	.
never	mind	.	i	wo	n't	get	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
but	the	next	step	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	universal	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.	``
and	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	--	the	 chart 	 er 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	must	lead	us	to	develop	through	true	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	what	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	universal	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.	``
in	the	great	 teach 	 ing 	 	of	his	holiness	the	dalai	lama	that	he	 al 	 ways 	 	 teach 	 es 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	that	that	is	the	common	 relig 	 ion 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	:	 kind 	 ness 	 	.
but	``	 kind 	 ness 	 	``	 mean 	 s 	 	``	universal	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.	``
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	other	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	us	:	we	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	that	,	and	we	should	take	it	and	do	 what 	 ever 	 	we	can	at	 what 	 ever 	 	little	level	and	small	level	that	we	can	do	it	.
we	 absolute 	 ly 	 	must	do	that	.	there	is	no	way	not	to	do	it	.
and	then	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	new	 orient 	 ation 	 	in	life	where	we	live	 equal 	 ly 	 	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	for	 other 	 s 	 	and	we	are	 joy 	 ful 	 	and	happy	.
one	thing	we	must	n't	think	is	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 make 	 s 	 	you	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	 make 	 s 	 	you	happy	.
the	first	person	who	is	happy	when	you	get	great	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 your 	 self 	 	,	even	if	you	have	n't	 d 	 one 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	yet	for	 any 	 body 	 	else	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	the	change	in	your	mind	 al 	 ready 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	for	other	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	:	they	can	sense	 th 	 is 	 	new	quality	in	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	it	 help 	 s 	 	them	 al 	 ready 	 	,	and	 give 	 s 	 	them	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
and	that	 un 	 com 	 passionate 	 	clock	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 show 	 ed 	 	me	that	it	's	all	over	.
so	,	practice	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	read	the	 chart 	 er 	 	,	disseminate	it	and	develop	it	 with 	 in 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.
do	n't	just	think	,	``	well	,	i	'm	 com 	 passionate 	 	,	``	or	``	i	'm	not	 com 	 passionate 	 	,	``	and	sort	of	think	you	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	there	.
you	can	develop	 th 	 is 	 	.	you	can	diminish	the	non	-	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	the	 cruel 	 ty 	 	,	the	callousness	,	the	neglect	of	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	take	universal	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	them	.
and	then	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	will	god	 s 	 mile 	 	and	the	 e 	 ternal 	 	mama	will	 s 	 mile 	 	,	but	karen	armstrong	will	 s 	 mile 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
