i	'd	like	to	talk	about	my	dad	.
my	dad	 ha 	 s 	 	alzheimer	's	disease	.
he	 start 	 ed 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	about	12	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	he	was	 official 	 ly 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	in	2005	.
now	he	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	sick	.	he	 need 	 s 	 	help	eating	,	he	 need 	 s 	 	help	 get 	 ting 	 	 dress 	 ed 	 	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	where	he	is	or	when	it	is	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	.
my	dad	was	my	hero	and	my	mentor	for	most	of	my	life	,	and	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	decade	 watch 	 ing 	 	him	disappear	.
my	dad	's	not	 al 	 one 	 	.	there	's	about	35	million	people	 global 	 ly 	 	living	with	some	kind	of	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	and	by	2030	they	're	 expect 	 ing 	 	that	to	double	to	70	million	.
that	's	a	lot	of	people	.
 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	 s 	 care 	 s 	 	us	.	the	 con 	 fused 	 	 face 	 s 	 	and	 sha 	 ky 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	of	people	who	have	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	the	big	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	who	get	it	,	they	frighten	us	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	fear	,	we	tend	to	do	one	of	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	we	go	 in 	 to 	 	 deni 	 al 	 	:	``	it	's	not	me	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	me	,	it	's	never	going	to	happen	to	me	.	``
or	,	we	decide	that	we	're	going	to	prevent	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	and	it	will	never	happen	to	us	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	right	and	it	wo	n't	come	and	get	us	.
i	'm	looking	for	a	third	way	:	i	'm	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	to	get	alzheimer	's	disease	.
 prevent 	 ion 	 	is	good	,	and	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	can	do	to	prevent	alzheimer	's	.
i	'm	eating	right	,	i	'm	 exercis 	 ing 	 	every	day	,	i	'm	 keep 	 ing 	 	my	mind	active	,	that	's	what	the	research	 say 	 s 	 	you	should	do	.
but	the	research	 al 	 so 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	will	100	percent	protect	you	.
if	the	 mon 	 ster 	 	 want 	 s 	 	you	,	the	 mon 	 ster 	 	's	gon	na	get	you	.
that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	my	dad	.
my	dad	was	a	 bi 	 lingual 	 	college	professor	.	his	 hob 	 bie 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ches 	 s 	 	,	bridge	and	writing	op	-	eds	.
he	got	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
if	the	 mon 	 ster 	 	 want 	 s 	 	you	,	the	 mon 	 ster 	 	's	gon	na	get	you	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	're	me	,	'	cause	alzheimer	's	 tend 	 s 	 	to	run	in	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
so	i	'm	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	to	get	alzheimer	's	disease	.
based	on	what	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	taking	care	of	my	father	,	and	 research 	 ing 	 	what	it	's	like	to	live	with	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	i	'm	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	three	 thing 	 s 	 	in	my	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	:	i	'm	changing	what	i	do	for	 f 	 un 	 	,	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	to	build	my	physical	strength	,	and	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	hard	one	--	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	better	person	.
let	's	start	with	the	 hob 	 bie 	 s 	 	.	when	you	get	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	and	 hard 	 er 	 	to	enjoy	 your 	 self 	 	.
you	ca	n't	 s 	 it 	 	and	have	long	 talk 	 s 	 	with	your	old	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	know	who	they	are	.
it	's	 con 	 fusing 	 	to	watch	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	and	often	 ver 	 y 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	.
and	 read 	 ing 	 	is	just	about	 im 	 possible 	 	.
when	you	care	for	 some 	 one 	 	with	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	and	you	get	training	,	they	train	you	to	engage	them	in	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	are	familiar	,	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	,	open	-	 end 	 ed 	 	.
with	my	dad	,	that	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 lett 	 ing 	 	him	fill	out	 form 	 s 	 	.
he	was	a	college	professor	at	a	state	school	;	he	 know 	 s 	 	what	 paper 	 work 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
he	'll	sign	his	name	on	every	line	,	he	'll	check	all	the	boxes	,	he	'll	put	 number 	 s 	 	in	where	he	 think 	 s 	 	there	should	be	 number 	 s 	 	.
but	it	got	me	 think 	 ing 	 	,	what	would	my	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	do	with	me	?
i	'm	my	father	's	daughter	.	i	read	,	i	write	,	i	think	about	global	health	a	lot	.
would	they	give	me	academic	 journal 	 s 	 	so	i	could	 s 	 crib 	 ble 	 	in	the	 margin 	 s 	 	?
would	they	give	me	 chart 	 s 	 	and	 graph 	 s 	 	that	i	could	color	?
so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	learn	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 like 	 d 	 	to	draw	,	so	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	it	more	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	at	it	.
i	am	 learn 	 ing 	 	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	origami	.	i	can	make	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	box	.
and	i	'm	 teach 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	knit	,	which	so	far	i	can	knit	a	blob	.
but	,	you	know	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	if	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	good	at	it	.	what	 matter 	 s 	 	is	that	my	 hand 	 s 	 	know	how	to	do	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	more	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	familiar	,	the	more	 thing 	 s 	 	my	 hand 	 s 	 	know	how	to	do	,	the	more	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	can	be	happy	and	 bus 	 y 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	when	my	brain	's	not	running	the	show	 any 	 more 	 	.
they	say	that	people	who	are	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	 activ 	 ities 	 	are	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	to	look	after	,	and	it	may	even	 s 	 low 	 	the	progress	of	the	disease	.
that	all	 seem 	 s 	 	like	win	to	me	.
i	want	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	happy	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	for	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	.
a	lot	of	people	do	n't	know	that	alzheimer	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	physical	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	cognitive	 symptom 	 s 	 	.	you	lose	your	sense	of	balance	,	you	get	muscle	 trem 	 ors 	 	,	and	that	 tend 	 s 	 	to	lead	people	to	 be 	 ing 	 	less	and	less	mobile	.
they	get	 scar 	 ed 	 	to	walk	around	.	they	get	 scar 	 ed 	 	to	move	.
so	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	will	build	my	sense	of	balance	.
i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 y 	 oga 	 	and	 ta 	 i 	 	chi	to	improve	my	balance	,	so	that	when	i	start	to	lose	it	,	i	'll	still	be	able	to	be	mobile	.
i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	weight	-	 bear 	 ing 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	so	that	i	have	the	muscle	strength	so	that	when	i	start	to	 with 	 er 	 	,	i	have	more	time	that	i	can	still	move	around	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	third	thing	.	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	better	person	.
my	dad	was	kind	and	loving	before	he	had	alzheimer	's	,	and	he	's	kind	and	loving	now	.
i	've	 s 	 een 	 	him	lose	his	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	,	his	sense	of	humor	,	his	language	 skill 	 s 	 	,	but	i	've	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	he	 love 	 s 	 	me	,	he	 love 	 s 	 	my	 son 	 s 	 	,	he	 love 	 s 	 	my	brother	and	my	mom	and	his	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	.
and	that	love	 make 	 s 	 	us	want	to	be	around	him	,	even	now	.
even	when	it	's	so	hard	.
when	you	take	away	 every 	 thing 	 	that	he	ever	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	his	naked	heart	still	 shine 	 s 	 	.
i	was	never	 a 	 s 	 	kind	 a 	 s 	 	my	dad	,	and	i	was	never	 a 	 s 	 	loving	.
and	what	i	need	now	is	to	learn	to	be	like	that	.
i	need	a	heart	so	 pur 	 e 	 	that	if	it	's	 strip 	 ped 	 	bare	by	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	it	will	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	to	get	alzheimer	's	disease	.
what	i	want	is	a	cure	in	the	next	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	soon	 en 	 ough 	 	to	protect	me	.
but	if	it	 come 	 s 	 	for	me	,	i	'm	going	to	be	ready	.
thank	you	.
