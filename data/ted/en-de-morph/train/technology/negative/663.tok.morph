the	 magic 	 al 	 	moment	,	the	 magic 	 al 	 	moment	of	 conduct 	 ing 	 	.
which	is	,	you	go	onto	a	stage	.	there	is	an	orchestra	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	.
they	are	all	,	you	know	,	 warm 	 ing 	 	up	and	 do 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
and	i	go	on	the	 pod 	 ium 	 	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	little	 off 	 ice 	 	of	the	conductor	.
or	 ra 	 ther 	 	a	 cubic 	 le 	 	,	an	open	-	space	 cubic 	 le 	 	,	with	a	lot	of	space	.
and	in	front	of	all	that	noise	,	you	do	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 gest 	 ure 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	pomp	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	out	of	the	 cha 	 os 	 	,	order	.
noise	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	music	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	fantastic	.	and	it	's	so	 tempt 	 ing 	 	to	think	that	it	's	all	about	me	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	great	people	here	,	 virtuos 	 os 	 	,	they	make	noise	,	they	need	me	to	do	that	.
not	 re 	 ally 	 	.	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	that	,	i	would	just	 s 	 ave 	 	you	the	talk	,	and	teach	you	the	 gest 	 ure 	 	.
so	you	could	go	out	to	the	world	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	thing	in	 what 	 ever 	 	company	or	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	,	and	you	have	perfect	 harmon 	 y 	 	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
let	's	look	at	the	first	video	.
i	hope	you	'll	think	it	's	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 harmon 	 y 	 	.
and	then	speak	a	little	bit	about	how	it	 come 	 s 	 	about	.
was	that	nice	?
so	that	was	a	sort	of	a	success	.
now	,	who	should	we	thank	for	the	success	?
i	mean	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	orchestra	 music 	 ians 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	,	the	vienna	 phil 	 harmon 	 ic 	 	orchestra	.
they	do	n't	often	even	look	at	the	conductor	.
then	you	have	the	 clap 	 ping 	 	audience	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	taking	part	in	 do 	 ing 	 	the	music	.
you	know	viennese	 audience 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	interfere	with	the	music	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 close 	 st 	 	to	an	 orient 	 al 	 	 bel 	 ly 	 danc 	 ing 	 	 f 	 east 	 	that	you	will	ever	get	in	vienna	.
 un 	 like 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	israel	,	where	 audience 	 s 	 	cough	all	the	time	.
you	know	,	arthur	rubinstein	,	the	pianist	,	used	to	say	that	,	``	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	people	that	have	the	flu	,	they	go	to	the	doctor	.
in	tel	aviv	they	come	to	my	 concert 	 s 	 	.	``
so	that	's	a	sort	of	a	tradition	.
but	viennese	 audience 	 s 	 	do	not	do	that	.
here	they	go	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	regular	,	just	to	be	part	of	that	,	to	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	orchestra	,	and	that	's	great	.
you	know	,	 audience 	 s 	 	like	you	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	make	the	event	.
but	what	about	the	conductor	?	what	can	you	say	the	conductor	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	?
um	,	he	was	happy	.
and	i	often	show	 th 	 is 	 	to	senior	management	.
people	get	 annoy 	 ed 	 	.
``	you	come	to	work	.	how	come	you	're	so	happy	?	``
 some 	 thing 	 	must	be	wrong	there	,	 yea 	 h 	 	?	but	he	's	 spread 	 ing 	 	happiness	.
and	i	think	the	happiness	,	the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	 th 	 is 	 	happiness	 do 	 es 	 	not	come	from	 on 	 ly 	 	his	own	story	and	his	joy	of	the	music	.
the	joy	is	about	 enabl 	 ing 	 	other	people	's	 st 	 ories 	 	to	be	heard	at	the	same	time	.
you	have	the	story	of	the	orchestra	 a 	 s 	 	a	professional	body	.
you	have	the	story	of	the	audience	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	.	 yea 	 h 	 	.
you	have	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	the	 individual 	 s 	 	in	the	orchestra	and	in	the	audience	.
and	then	you	have	other	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	.
people	who	build	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	concert	hall	.
people	who	made	 t 	 hose 	 	stradivarius	,	amati	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	heard	at	the	same	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	true	experience	of	a	live	concert	.
that	's	a	reason	to	go	out	of	home	.	 yea 	 h 	 	?
and	not	all	 conductor 	 s 	 	do	just	that	.
let	's	see	 some 	 body 	 	else	,	a	great	conductor	.
riccardo	muti	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	short	,	but	you	could	see	it	's	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	figure	.	right	?
he	's	awesome	.	he	's	so	 command 	 ing 	 	.	 yea 	 h 	 	?
so	clear	.	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	bit	over	-	clear	.
can	we	have	a	little	 demonst 	 ration 	 	?	would	you	be	my	orchestra	for	a	second	?
can	you	 s 	 ing 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	the	first	note	of	don	giovanni	?
you	have	to	 s 	 ing 	 	``	aaaaaah	,	``	and	i	'll	stop	you	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	ready	?
audience	:	♫	aaaaaaah	...	♫	itay	talgam	:	come	on	,	with	me	.	if	you	do	it	 with 	 out 	 	me	i	feel	even	more	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ant 	 	than	i	 al 	 ready 	 	feel	.
so	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	wait	for	the	conductor	.
now	look	at	me	.	``	aaaaaah	,	``	and	i	stop	you	.	let	's	go	.
audience	:	♫	...	aaaaaaaah	...	♫	itay	talgam	:	so	we	'll	have	a	little	chat	 lat 	 er 	 	.
but	...	there	is	a	 vac 	 ancy 	 	for	a	...
but	--	--	you	could	see	that	you	could	stop	an	orchestra	with	a	finger	.
now	what	 do 	 es 	 	riccardo	muti	do	?	he	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	...
and	then	--	sort	of	--	so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 instruct 	 ion 	 	is	clear	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	 sanct 	 ion 	 	,	what	will	happen	if	you	do	n't	do	what	i	tell	you	.
so	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	--	to	a	certain	point	.
when	muti	is	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	why	do	you	conduct	like	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	 respons 	 ible 	 	.	``
 respons 	 ible 	 	in	front	of	him	.
no	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	mean	him	.	he	 mean 	 s 	 	mozart	,	which	is	--	--	like	a	third	seat	from	the	center	.
so	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	if	i	'm	--	if	i	'm	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	mozart	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	the	 on 	 ly 	 	story	to	be	told	.
it	's	mozart	 a 	 s 	 	i	,	riccardo	muti	,	understand	it	.	``
and	you	know	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	muti	?
three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	he	got	a	letter	 sign 	 ed 	 	by	all	700	 employ 	 ees 	 	of	la	scala	,	musical	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	i	mean	the	 music 	 ians 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	you	're	a	great	conductor	.	we	do	n't	want	to	work	with	you	.	 pleas 	 e 	 	 re 	 sign 	 	.	``
``	why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	let	us	develop	.
you	're	using	us	 a 	 s 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	.
and	our	joy	of	music	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	.	.	.	``
so	he	had	to	 re 	 sign 	 	.	is	n't	that	nice	?
he	's	a	nice	guy	.	he	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	guy	.
well	,	can	you	do	it	with	less	control	,	or	with	a	different	kind	of	control	?
let	's	look	at	the	next	conductor	,	richard	strauss	.
i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	you	'll	get	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 pick 	 ed 	 	on	him	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	old	.
it	's	not	true	.	when	he	was	a	young	man	of	about	30	,	he	wrote	what	he	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	for	 conductor 	 s 	 	.	``
the	first	one	was	:	if	you	sweat	by	the	end	of	the	concert	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	must	have	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	.
that	's	the	first	one	.	the	fourth	one	you	'll	like	better	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	:	never	look	at	the	 trom 	 bone 	 s 	 	--	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 encourag 	 es 	 	them	.
so	,	the	whole	idea	is	 re 	 ally 	 	to	let	it	happen	by	 it 	 self 	 	.
do	not	interfere	.
but	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	happen	?	did	you	see	him	 turn 	 ing 	 	 page 	 s 	 	in	the	score	?
now	,	either	he	is	 s 	 en 	 ile 	 	,	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	remember	his	own	music	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	wrote	the	music	.
or	he	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 transfer 	 ring 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 mess 	 age 	 	to	them	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	come	on	 guy 	 s 	 	.	you	have	to	play	by	the	book	.
so	it	's	not	about	my	story	.	it	's	not	about	your	story	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 exec 	 ution 	 	of	the	written	music	,	no	 interpret 	 ation 	 	.	``
 interpret 	 ation 	 	is	the	real	story	of	the	 perform 	 er 	 	.
so	,	no	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	that	.	that	's	a	different	kind	of	control	.
let	's	see	 an 	 other 	 	super	-	conductor	,	a	german	super	-	conductor	.	herbert	von	karajan	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
what	's	different	?	did	you	see	the	 eye 	 s 	 	?	closed	.
did	you	see	the	 hand 	 s 	 	?
did	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	?	let	me	conduct	you	.	twice	.
once	like	a	muti	,	and	you	'll	--	--	clap	,	just	once	.
and	then	like	karajan	.	let	's	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
like	muti	.	you	ready	?	 be 	 cause 	 	muti	...
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	ready	?	let	's	do	it	.
audience	:	itay	talgam	:	hmm	...	 aga 	 in 	 	.
audience	:	itay	talgam	:	good	.	now	like	a	karajan	.	since	you	're	 al 	 ready 	 	trained	,	let	me	 concent 	 rate 	 	,	close	my	 eye 	 s 	 	.	come	,	come	.
audience	:	itay	talgam	:	why	not	together	?
 be 	 cause 	 	you	did	n't	know	when	to	play	.
now	i	can	tell	you	,	even	the	berlin	 phil 	 harmon 	 ic 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	when	to	play	.
but	i	'll	tell	you	how	they	do	it	.	no	 cynic 	 ism 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	german	orchestra	,	 y 	 es 	 	?
they	look	at	karajan	.	and	then	they	look	at	each	other	.
``	do	you	understand	what	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 want 	 s 	 	?	``
and	after	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	look	at	each	other	,	and	the	first	 player 	 s 	 	of	the	orchestra	lead	the	whole	 en 	 s 	 em 	 ble 	 	in	 play 	 ing 	 	together	.
and	when	karajan	is	 ask 	 ed 	 	about	it	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	the	worst	damage	i	can	do	to	my	orchestra	is	to	give	them	a	clear	 instruct 	 ion 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	would	prevent	the	 en 	 s 	 em 	 ble 	 	,	the	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	that	is	 need 	 ed 	 	for	an	orchestra	.	``
now	that	's	great	.	what	about	the	 eye 	 s 	 	?
why	are	the	 eye 	 s 	 	closed	?
there	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	story	about	karajan	 conduct 	 ing 	 	in	london	.
and	he	 cue 	 s 	 	in	a	 flut 	 e 	 	player	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	guy	 ha 	 s 	 	no	idea	what	to	do	.
``	 ma 	 e 	 stro 	 	,	with	all	due	respect	,	when	should	i	start	?	``
what	do	you	think	karajan	's	 re 	 ply 	 	was	?	when	should	i	start	?
oh	 yea 	 h 	 	.	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	start	when	you	ca	n't	stand	it	 any 	 more 	 	.	``
meaning	that	you	know	you	have	no	 author 	 ity 	 	to	change	 any 	 thing 	 	.
it	's	my	music	.	the	real	music	is	 on 	 ly 	 	in	karajan	's	head	.
and	you	have	to	guess	my	mind	.	so	you	are	under	tremendous	pressure	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	give	you	 instruct 	 ion 	 	,	and	yet	,	you	have	to	guess	my	mind	.
so	it	's	a	different	kind	of	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	spiritual	but	yet	 ver 	 y 	 	firm	control	.
can	we	do	it	in	 an 	 other 	 	way	?	of	course	we	can	.	let	's	go	back	to	the	first	conductor	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	:	carlos	kleiber	,	his	name	.	next	video	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.
well	,	it	is	different	.	but	is	n't	that	 controll 	 ing 	 	in	the	same	way	?
no	,	it	's	not	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	is	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	what	to	do	.
when	he	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	not	,	``	take	your	stradivarius	and	like	jimi	hendrix	,	 s 	 mash 	 	it	on	the	floor	.	``	it	's	not	that	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 gest 	 ure 	 	of	the	music	.
i	'm	 open 	 ing 	 	a	space	for	you	to	put	in	 an 	 other 	 	layer	of	 interpret 	 ation 	 	.	``
that	is	 an 	 other 	 	story	.
but	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	work	together	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	them	 instruct 	 ions 	 	?
it	's	like	 be 	 ing 	 	on	a	 roller 	 coast 	 er 	 	.	 yea 	 h 	 	?
you	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 give 	 n 	 	any	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,	but	the	 force 	 s 	 	of	the	process	 it 	 self 	 	keep	you	in	place	.
that	's	what	he	 do 	 es 	 	.
the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	of	course	the	 roller 	 coast 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	exist	.
it	's	not	a	physical	thing	.	it	's	in	the	 player 	 s 	 	'	 head 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	.
you	have	the	plan	in	your	head	.
you	know	what	to	do	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	kleiber	is	not	 conduct 	 ing 	 	you	.
but	here	and	there	and	that	.	you	know	what	to	do	.
and	you	 be 	 come 	 	a	partner	building	the	 roller 	 coast 	 er 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	with	sound	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	the	ride	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 player 	 s 	 	.
they	do	need	to	go	to	a	 s 	 an 	 ator 	 ium 	 	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	 lat 	 er 	 	.
it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 ti 	 ring 	 	.	 yea 	 h 	 	?
but	it	's	the	best	music	making	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	of	course	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	about	 motiv 	 ation 	 	and	giving	them	a	lot	of	physical	energy	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	professional	.
and	look	 aga 	 in 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	kleiber	.
can	we	have	the	next	video	,	 quick 	 ly 	 	?
you	'll	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	there	is	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	you	see	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	body	language	.
and	now	there	is	a	 trump 	 et 	 	player	who	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	way	it	should	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
go	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	video	.	look	.
see	,	second	time	for	the	same	player	.
and	now	the	third	time	for	the	same	player	.
``	wait	for	me	after	the	concert	.
i	have	a	short	notice	to	give	you	.	``
you	know	,	when	it	's	 need 	 ed 	 	,	the	 author 	 ity 	 	is	there	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	 author 	 ity 	 	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	people	your	 partner 	 s 	 	.
let	's	see	the	next	video	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	here	.
you	might	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 een 	 	kleiber	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 hyper 	 active 	 	guy	.
he	's	 conduct 	 ing 	 	mozart	.
the	whole	orchestra	is	 play 	 ing 	 	.
now	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
see	?	he	is	there	100	percent	,	but	not	 command 	 ing 	 	,	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	what	to	do	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	what	the	 s 	 olo 	 ist 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 s 	 olo 	 	now	.	see	what	you	can	pick	up	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
look	at	the	 eye 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	you	see	that	?
first	of	all	,	it	's	a	kind	of	a	compliment	we	all	like	to	get	.
it	's	not	 feed 	 back 	 	.	it	's	an	``	mmmm	.	.	.	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	here	.
so	that	's	a	good	thing	.
and	the	second	thing	is	it	's	about	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	control	,	but	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	way	.
when	kleiber	 do 	 es 	 	--	did	you	see	the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	going	from	here	?
you	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?	 gravit 	 ation 	 	is	no	more	.
kleiber	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 create 	 s 	 	a	process	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 create 	 s 	 	the	 condition 	 s 	 	in	the	world	in	which	 th 	 is 	 	process	 take 	 s 	 	place	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 obo 	 e 	 	player	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	autonomous	and	 there 	 fore 	 	happy	and	proud	of	his	work	,	and	creative	and	all	of	that	.
and	the	level	in	which	kleiber	is	in	control	is	in	a	different	level	.
so	control	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	zero	-	sum	game	.
you	have	 th 	 is 	 	control	.	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	control	.	and	all	you	put	together	,	in	 partner 	 ship 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	about	the	best	music	.
so	kleiber	is	about	process	.
kleiber	is	about	 condition 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
but	you	need	to	have	process	and	content	to	create	the	meaning	.
lenny	bernstein	,	my	own	personal	 ma 	 e 	 stro 	 	.
