so	 any 	 way 	 	,	who	am	i	?
i	 usual 	 ly 	 	say	to	people	,	when	they	say	,	``	what	do	you	do	?	``
i	say	,	``	i	do	 hard 	 ware 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	sort	of	 convenient 	 ly 	 	 en 	 compass 	 es 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	i	do	.
and	i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	to	a	venture	 capital 	 ist 	 	 casual 	 ly 	 	at	some	 val 	 ley 	 	event	,	to	which	he	 re 	 plied 	 	,	``	how	 qu 	 ain 	 t 	 	.	``

and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	should	have	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	smart	.
and	now	i	've	had	a	little	bit	of	time	to	think	about	it	,	i	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	if	we	look	at	the	next	100	 year 	 s 	 	and	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	all	these	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	last	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	most	of	the	big	 issue 	 s 	 	--	clean	water	,	clean	energy	--	and	they	're	 inter 	 change 	 able 	 	in	some	 respect 	 s 	 	--	and	 clean 	 er 	 	,	more	functional	 material 	 s 	 	--	they	all	look	to	me	to	be	 hard 	 ware 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	we	should	 ignor 	 e 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	or	information	,	or	computation	.	``
and	that	's	in	fact	 prob 	 ably 	 	what	i	'm	going	to	try	and	tell	you	about	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	talk	is	going	to	be	about	how	do	we	make	 thing 	 s 	 	and	what	are	the	new	ways	that	we	're	going	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
now	,	ted	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	you	a	lot	of	spam	if	you	're	a	speaker	about	``	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	do	that	``	and	you	fill	out	all	these	 form 	 s 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	how	they	're	going	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	you	,	and	it	 flash 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	my	desk	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	futurist	.
and	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	nervous	about	the	term	``	futurist	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	you	seem	 doom 	 ed 	 	to	failure	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	predict	it	.
and	i	was	 laugh 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	i	have	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	well	,	if	i	have	to	talk	about	the	future	,	what	is	it	?	``
and	george	homsey	,	a	great	guy	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	the	future	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
it	is	so	much	 strange 	 r 	 	than	you	think	.
we	're	going	to	 re 	 program 	 	the	bacteria	in	your	gut	,	and	we	're	going	to	make	your	poo	smell	like	 pepper 	 mint 	 	.	``
so	,	you	may	think	that	's	sort	of	 re 	 ally 	 	crazy	,	but	there	are	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	that	make	 th 	 is 	 	possible	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	my	work	,	but	it	's	work	of	good	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	at	mit	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 registr 	 y 	 	of	standard	 bio 	 logical 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	headed	by	drew	endy	and	tom	 k 	 night 	 	and	a	few	other	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	 individual 	 s 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	looking	at	biology	 a 	 s 	 	a	 programm 	 able 	 	system	.
 liter 	 ally 	 	,	think	of	 protein 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 sub 	 routine 	 s 	 	that	you	can	string	together	to	execute	a	program	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	idea	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	state	 dia 	 gram 	 	.	that	's	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	simple	computer	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	a	two	-	bit	counter	.
so	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	 computation 	 al 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	two	light	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	built	by	a	group	of	 student 	 s 	 	at	zurich	for	a	design	 com 	 petition 	 	in	biology	.
and	from	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	the	same	 com 	 petition 	 	last	year	,	a	university	of	texas	team	of	 student 	 s 	 	 programm 	 ed 	 	bacteria	so	that	they	can	detect	light	and	 s 	 witch 	 	on	and	off	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	in	the	sense	that	you	can	now	do	``	if	-	then	-	for	``	 state 	 ments 	 	in	 material 	 s 	 	,	in	structure	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	trend	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	used	to	live	in	a	world	where	 every 	 one 	 	's	 s 	 aid 	 	 glib 	 ly 	 	,	``	form	 follow 	 s 	 	function	,	``	but	i	think	i	've	sort	of	grown	up	in	a	world	--	you	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	neil	gershenfeld	 yester 	 day 	 	;	i	was	in	a	lab	 associate 	 d 	 	with	his	--	where	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	world	where	information	 define 	 s 	 	form	and	function	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	six	 year 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	,	but	to	show	you	the	power	of	art	over	science	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 cartoon 	 s 	 	i	write	.	these	are	 call 	 ed 	 	``	howtoons	.	``
i	work	with	a	fabulous	 illustr 	 ator 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	nick	dragotta	.
took	me	six	 year 	 s 	 	at	mit	,	and	about	that	 man 	 y 	 	 page 	 s 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	took	him	one	page	.	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	muse	tucker	.
he	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	little	kid	--	and	his	sister	,	celine	--	and	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	here	is	 observ 	 ing 	 	the	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	of	his	cheerios	in	his	 ce 	 real 	 	bowl	.
and	in	fact	you	can	program	the	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	so	he	 start 	 s 	 	chocolate	-	 dip 	 ping 	 	 edge 	 s 	 	,	changing	the	 hydro 	 phobic 	 ity 	 	and	the	 hydro 	 phyl 	 icity 	 	.
in	 theor 	 y 	 	,	if	you	program	 t 	 hose 	 	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	,	you	should	be	able	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	make	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	structure	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	he	's	 d 	 one 	 	self	-	 replica 	 tion 	 	of	a	complex	3d	structure	.
and	that	's	what	i	thought	about	for	a	long	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	 current 	 ly 	 	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	silicon	wafer	,	and	 essential 	 ly 	 	that	's	just	a	whole	bunch	of	 layer 	 s 	 	of	two	-	dimensional	stuff	,	sort	of	 layer 	 ed 	 	up	.
the	feature	side	is	--	you	know	,	people	will	say	,	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	down	around	about	65	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	now	.
on	the	right	,	that	's	a	 radio 	 lar 	 a 	 	.
that	's	a	 uni 	 cellular 	 	organism	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	feature	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	down	to	about	20	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	a	complex	3d	structure	.
we	could	do	a	lot	more	with	 computer 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	if	we	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	build	 thing 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
the	secret	to	biology	is	,	it	 build 	 s 	 	computation	 in 	 to 	 	the	way	it	 make 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	little	thing	here	,	 polymer 	 ase 	 	,	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 super 	 computer 	 	designed	for	 replica 	 ting 	 	dna	.
and	the	ribosome	here	is	 an 	 other 	 	little	computer	that	 help 	 s 	 	in	the	 transl 	 ation 	 	of	the	 protein 	 s 	 	.
i	thought	about	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	sense	that	it	's	great	to	build	in	 bio 	 logical 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	but	can	we	do	similar	 thing 	 s 	 	?
can	we	get	self	-	 replica 	 ting 	 	-	type	behavior	?
can	we	get	complex	3d	structure	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 assem 	 bling 	 	in	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 system 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	some	 advantage 	 s 	 	to	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	like	 high 	 er 	 	speed	 semi 	 conductor 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	some	of	my	work	on	how	do	you	do	an	 autonomous 	 ly 	 	self	-	 replica 	 ting 	 	system	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	babbage	's	 re 	 venge 	 	.
these	are	little	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	.
these	are	five	-	state	state	 machine 	 s 	 	.
so	,	that	's	about	three	light	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	lined	up	.
in	a	neutral	state	,	they	wo	n't	bind	at	all	.
now	,	if	i	make	a	string	of	these	,	a	bit	string	,	they	will	be	able	to	replicate	.
so	we	start	with	white	,	blue	,	blue	,	white	.
that	 encode 	 s 	 	;	that	will	now	copy	.	from	one	 come 	 s 	 	two	,	and	then	from	two	 come 	 s 	 	three	.
and	so	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 replica 	 ting 	 	system	.
it	was	work	 actual 	 ly 	 	by	lionel	penrose	,	father	of	roger	penrose	,	the	 tile 	 s 	 	guy	.
he	did	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	in	the	'60s	,	and	so	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	logic	 theor 	 y 	 	lay	 f 	 allow 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	went	down	the	digital	computer	revolution	,	but	it	's	now	coming	back	.
so	now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	 hand 	 s 	 	-	free	,	autonomous	self	-	 replica 	 tion 	 	.
so	we	've	 track 	 ed 	 	in	the	video	the	 in 	 put 	 	string	,	which	was	green	,	green	,	yellow	,	yellow	,	green	.
we	set	them	off	on	 th 	 is 	 	air	 hoc 	 key 	 	table	.
you	know	,	high	science	uses	air	 hoc 	 key 	 	 table 	 s 	 	--	--	and	if	you	watch	 th 	 is 	 	thing	long	 en 	 ough 	 	you	get	dizzy	,	but	what	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	is	copies	of	that	original	string	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	the	 part 	 s 	 	bin	that	you	have	here	.
so	we	've	got	autonomous	 replica 	 tion 	 	of	bit	 string 	 s 	 	.
so	,	why	would	you	want	to	replicate	bit	 string 	 s 	 	?
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	biology	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	other	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	meme	,	that	you	can	take	a	linear	string	,	which	is	a	convenient	thing	to	copy	,	and	you	can	fold	that	 in 	 to 	 	an	 arbitr 	 arily 	 	complex	3d	structure	.
so	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	,	you	know	,	take	the	engineer	's	version	:	can	we	build	a	 mechanic 	 al 	 	system	in	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 material 	 s 	 	that	will	do	the	same	thing	?
so	what	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	here	is	that	we	can	make	a	2d	shape	--	the	b	--	assemble	from	a	string	of	 component 	 s 	 	that	follow	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	simple	 rule 	 s 	 	.
and	the	whole	point	of	going	with	the	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	simple	 rule 	 s 	 	here	,	and	the	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	simple	state	 machine 	 s 	 	in	the	previous	design	,	was	that	you	do	n't	need	digital	logic	to	do	computation	.
and	that	way	you	can	scale	 thing 	 s 	 	much	 small 	 er 	 	than	 micro 	 chip 	 s 	 	.
so	you	can	 liter 	 ally 	 	use	these	 a 	 s 	 	the	 tin 	 y 	 	 component 	 s 	 	in	the	 assem 	 bly 	 	process	.
so	,	neil	gershenfeld	 show 	 ed 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	video	on	wednesday	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	but	i	'll	show	you	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	 color 	 ed 	 	sequence	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	.
each	different	color	 ha 	 s 	 	a	different	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 polar 	 ity 	 	,	and	the	sequence	is	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	 spec 	 ifying 	 	the	structure	that	is	coming	out	.
now	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	graph	 theor 	 y 	 	can	look	at	that	,	and	that	will	satisfy	you	that	that	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	3d	structure	,	and	in	fact	,	you	know	,	i	can	now	take	a	dog	,	carve	it	up	and	then	 re 	 assemble 	 	it	so	it	's	a	linear	string	that	will	fold	from	a	sequence	.	and	now	i	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	define	that	three	-	dimensional	object	 a 	 s 	 	a	sequence	of	bits	.
so	,	you	know	,	it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	world	when	you	start	looking	at	the	world	a	little	bit	 different 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	now	a	 compil 	 er 	 	.
and	so	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	you	know	,	what	are	the	 program 	 s 	 	for	 programm 	 ing 	 	the	physical	 uni 	 verse 	 	?
and	how	do	we	think	about	 material 	 s 	 	and	structure	,	sort	of	 a 	 s 	 	an	information	and	computation	problem	?
not	just	where	you	attach	a	micro	-	 controll 	 er 	 	to	the	end	point	,	but	that	the	structure	and	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	are	the	logic	,	are	the	 computer 	 s 	 	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 absorb 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	a	little	 different 	 ly 	 	.
with	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	computer	,	you	can	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 drop 	 let 	 	of	water	 a 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 perform 	 ed 	 	the	 computation 	 s 	 	.
you	set	a	couple	of	 bound 	 ary 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	like	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	the	surface	tension	,	density	,	etc	.	,	and	then	you	press	``	execute	,	``	and	 magic 	 ally 	 	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 produce 	 s 	 	you	a	perfect	ball	lens	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	the	problem	of	--	so	there	's	a	half	a	billion	to	a	billion	people	in	the	world	do	n't	have	access	to	cheap	 eye 	 glass 	 es 	 	.
so	can	you	make	a	machine	that	could	make	any	prescription	lens	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	on	 s 	 ite 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	machine	where	you	 liter 	 ally 	 	define	a	 bound 	 ary 	 	condition	.
if	it	's	 circul 	 ar 	 	,	you	make	a	 spheric 	 al 	 	lens	.
if	it	's	 elli 	 pt 	 ical 	 	,	you	can	make	an	 astigm 	 atic 	 	lens	.
you	then	put	a	membrane	on	that	and	you	 app 	 ly 	 	pressure	--	so	that	's	part	of	the	extra	program	.
and	 liter 	 ally 	 	with	 on 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	--	so	,	the	shape	of	your	 bound 	 ary 	 	condition	and	the	pressure	--	you	can	define	an	infinite	number	of	 lens 	 es 	 	that	cover	the	range	of	human	 refr 	 active 	 	error	,	from	minus	12	to	plus	eight	 di 	 opt 	 ers 	 	,	up	to	four	 di 	 opt 	 ers 	 	of	cylinder	.
and	then	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	you	now	pour	on	a	 mono 	 mer 	 	.
you	know	,	i	'll	do	a	julia	childs	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	three	 minute 	 s 	 	of	uv	light	.
and	you	reverse	the	pressure	on	your	membrane	once	you	've	 cook 	 ed 	 	it	.	pop	it	out	.
i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	but	i	still	do	n't	know	if	it	's	going	to	end	right	.
so	you	reverse	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	movie	,	so	with	the	new	 prototype 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	both	 surface 	 s 	 	are	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	will	show	you	the	point	.
now	you	've	 finish 	 ed 	 	the	lens	,	you	 liter 	 ally 	 	pop	it	out	.
that	's	next	year	's	yves	klein	,	you	know	,	 eye 	 glass 	 es 	 	shape	.
and	you	can	see	that	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mild	prescription	of	about	minus	two	 di 	 opt 	 ers 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 rot 	 ate 	 	it	against	 th 	 is 	 	side	shot	,	you	'll	see	that	that	 ha 	 s 	 	cylinder	,	and	that	was	 programm 	 ed 	 	in	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	physics	of	the	system	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	structure	 a 	 s 	 	computation	and	structure	 a 	 s 	 	information	 lead 	 s 	 	to	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	my	people	at	 s 	 quid 	 	 lab 	 s 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	at	the	moment	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 electron 	 ic 	 	rope	.	``
so	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	you	think	about	a	rope	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	structure	in	the	weave	.
and	under	no	load	,	it	's	one	structure	.
under	a	different	load	,	it	's	a	different	structure	.	and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	exploit	that	by	 put 	 ting 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	number	of	 conduct 	 ing 	 	 fiber 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	it	a	sensor	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	a	rope	that	 know 	 s 	 	the	load	on	the	rope	at	any	 part 	 icular 	 	point	in	the	rope	.
just	by	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	physics	of	the	world	,	 material 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	computer	,	you	can	start	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	segue	a	little	here	.
i	guess	i	'm	just	going	to	 casual 	 ly 	 	tell	you	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	think	about	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	thing	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	right	now	is	,	how	,	if	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	taking	 th 	 is 	 	view	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	computer	,	how	do	we	make	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	general	sense	,	and	how	might	we	share	the	way	we	make	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	general	sense	the	same	way	you	share	open	source	 hard 	 ware 	 	?
and	a	lot	of	 talk 	 s 	 	here	have	 e 	 spouse 	 d 	 	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	look	at	 problem 	 s 	 	,	share	the	information	and	work	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	.
so	,	a	convenient	thing	about	 be 	 ing 	 	a	human	is	you	move	in	linear	time	,	and	 un 	 less 	 	lisa	randall	 change 	 s 	 	that	,	we	'll	 continu 	 e 	 	to	move	in	linear	time	.
so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	you	do	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	you	make	,	you	produce	a	sequence	of	 step 	 s 	 	--	and	i	think	lego	in	the	'70s	 nail 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	did	it	most	 elegant 	 ly 	 	.
but	they	can	show	you	how	to	build	 thing 	 s 	 	in	sequence	.
so	,	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	how	can	we	 general 	 ize 	 	the	way	we	make	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	so	you	end	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	guy	,	right	?
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 appli 	 es 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	broad	--	sort	of	,	a	lot	of	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	cameron	sinclair	 yester 	 day 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	do	i	get	 every 	 one 	 	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	on	design	 global 	 ly 	 	to	do	housing	for	 human 	 ity 	 	?	``
and	if	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	amy	smith	,	she	 talk 	 s 	 	about	how	you	get	 student 	 s 	 	at	mit	to	work	with	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	.
and	i	think	we	have	to	sort	of	 re 	 define 	 	and	 re 	 think 	 	how	we	define	structure	and	 material 	 s 	 	and	 assem 	 bly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	so	that	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	share	the	information	on	how	you	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	more	 pro 	 found 	 	way	and	build	on	each	other	's	source	code	for	structure	.
i	do	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	yet	,	but	,	you	know	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 active 	 ly 	 	thought	about	.
so	,	you	know	,	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 question 	 s 	 	like	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	 compil 	 er 	 	?	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	sub	-	routine	?
 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	too	abstract	,	but	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sort	of	--	 return 	 ing 	 	to	our	 com 	 ic 	 	 character 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	or	a	different	 uni 	 verse 	 	view	,	that	i	think	is	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 pre 	 valent 	 	in	the	future	--	from	 bio 	 tech 	 	to	 material 	 s 	 	 assem 	 bly 	 	.	it	was	great	to	hear	bill	joy	.
they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	invest	in	 material 	 s 	 	science	,	but	these	are	the	new	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 material 	 s 	 	science	.
how	do	we	put	real	information	and	real	structure	 in 	 to 	 	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	see	the	world	in	a	different	way	?	and	it	's	not	going	to	be	 bin 	 ary 	 	code	that	 define 	 s 	 	the	 computer 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	it	's	sort	of	an	analog	computer	.
but	it	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	new	 world 	 view 	 	.
i	've	gone	too	far	.	so	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	it	's	it	.
i	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	got	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	,	or	i	can	show	--	i	think	they	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	i	do	 extrem 	 e 	 	stuff	in	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	,	so	i	may	have	to	explain	that	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	i	'll	do	that	with	 th 	 is 	 	short	video	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	3,000	-	square	-	foot	kite	,	which	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	a	minimal	energy	surface	.
so	 return 	 ing 	 	to	the	 drop 	 let 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	in	a	new	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kite	designed	by	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	dave	kulp	.
and	why	do	you	want	a	3,000	-	square	-	foot	kite	?
so	that	's	a	kite	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	your	house	.
and	so	you	want	that	to	tow	 boat 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	a	little	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	with	a	couple	of	other	 guy 	 s 	 	.
but	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	way	to	look	at	the	--	if	you	abstract	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	structure	that	is	defined	by	the	physics	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
you	could	just	hang	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	bed	sheet	,	but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	computation	of	all	the	physics	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	 aero 	 dynamic 	 	shape	.
and	so	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	sort	of	 al 	 most 	 	double	your	boat	speed	with	 system 	 s 	 	like	that	.	so	that	's	sort	of	 an 	 other 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	future	.
