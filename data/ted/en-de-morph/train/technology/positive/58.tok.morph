i	'm	the	 luck 	 iest 	 	guy	in	the	world	.
i	got	to	see	the	last	case	of	killer	 small 	 pox 	 	in	the	world	.
i	was	in	india	 th 	 is 	 	past	year	,	and	i	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	last	 case 	 s 	 	of	 poli 	 o 	 	in	the	world	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	feel	more	--	the	 bless 	 ing 	 	and	the	honor	of	 work 	 ing 	 	in	a	program	like	that	than	to	know	that	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 horr 	 ible 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	--	--	so	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	some	 dirt 	 y 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	.
they	are	difficult	to	watch	,	but	you	should	look	at	them	with	 optim 	 ism 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 horr 	 or 	 	of	these	 picture 	 s 	 	will	be	 match 	 ed 	 	by	the	 up 	 lift 	 ing 	 	quality	of	 know 	 ing 	 	that	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	exist	.
but	first	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	my	own	journey	.
my	 back 	 ground 	 	is	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 convention 	 al 	 	medical	education	that	you	might	expect	.
when	i	was	an	intern	in	san	francisco	,	i	heard	about	a	group	of	native	americans	who	had	taken	over	alcatraz	 is 	 land 	 	,	and	a	native	american	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	birth	on	that	 is 	 land 	 	,	and	no	other	doctor	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	and	help	her	give	birth	.
i	went	out	to	alcatraz	,	and	i	lived	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 week 	 s 	 	.
she	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	;	i	caught	the	baby	;	i	got	off	the	 is 	 land 	 	;	i	 land 	 ed 	 	in	san	francisco	;	and	all	the	press	 want 	 ed 	 	to	talk	to	me	 be 	 cause 	 	my	three	 week 	 s 	 	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	made	me	an	expert	in	indian	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	.
i	wound	up	on	every	 tele 	 vision 	 	show	.
 some 	 one 	 	saw	me	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	;	they	 call 	 ed 	 	me	up	;	and	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	i	'd	like	to	be	in	a	movie	and	to	play	a	young	doctor	for	a	bunch	of	rock	and	roll	 star 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	in	a	bus	ride	from	san	francisco	to	england	.	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	would	do	that	,	so	i	 be 	 came 	 	the	doctor	in	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	awful	movie	 call 	 ed 	 	``	medicine	ball	 car 	 a 	 van 	 	.	``
now	,	you	know	from	the	'60s	,	you	're	either	on	the	bus	or	you	're	off	the	bus	.
i	was	on	the	bus	.	my	wife	and	i	,	of	37	 year 	 s 	 	,	 join 	 ed 	 	the	bus	.
our	bus	ride	took	us	from	san	francisco	to	london	.
we	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	 bus 	 es 	 	at	the	big	pond	.	we	then	got	on	two	more	 bus 	 es 	 	and	we	drove	through	 tur 	 key 	 	and	iran	,	afghanistan	,	over	the	khyber	pass	,	 in 	 to 	 	pakistan	,	like	every	other	young	doctor	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	us	at	the	khyber	pass	,	and	that	's	our	bus	.
we	had	some	 difficult 	 y 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	over	the	khyber	pass	,	but	we	wound	up	in	india	.
and	then	,	like	 every 	 one 	 	else	in	our	generation	,	we	went	to	live	in	a	himalayan	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	like	a	 re 	 side 	 ncy 	 	program	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	that	are	in	medical	school	.
and	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	with	a	wise	man	,	a	guru	named	karoli	baba	,	who	then	told	me	to	get	rid	of	the	dress	,	put	on	a	three	-	piece	suit	,	go	join	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	diplomat	and	work	for	the	world	health	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
and	he	made	an	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	 predict 	 ion 	 	that	 small 	 pox 	 	would	be	 eradic 	 ated 	 	,	and	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	god	's	gift	to	 human 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	hard	work	of	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 predict 	 ion 	 	came	true	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	is	rahima	banu	,	and	she	was	the	last	case	of	killer	 small 	 pox 	 	in	the	world	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	document	is	the	certificate	that	the	global	commission	 sign 	 ed 	 	 cert 	 ifying 	 	the	world	to	have	 eradic 	 ated 	 	the	first	disease	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
the	key	to	 eradic 	 ating 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	was	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	early	 respons 	 e 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	repeat	that	:	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	early	 respons 	 e 	 	.
can	you	say	that	?
audience	:	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	early	 respons 	 e 	 	.
larry	 brilli 	 ant 	 	:	 small 	 pox 	 	was	the	worst	disease	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	 kill 	 ed 	 	more	people	than	all	the	 war 	 s 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
in	the	last	century	,	it	 kill 	 ed 	 	500	million	people	.
more	than	two	--	you	're	 read 	 ing 	 	about	larry	page	 al 	 ready 	 	,	 some 	 body 	 	 read 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
in	the	year	that	larry	page	and	sergey	brin	--	with	whom	i	have	a	certain	 affect 	 ion 	 	and	a	new	 affili 	 ation 	 	--	in	the	year	in	which	they	 we 	 re 	 	born	,	two	million	people	 di 	 ed 	 	of	 small 	 pox 	 	.
we	 declare 	 d 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	 eradic 	 ated 	 	in	1980	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	slide	that	i	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	in	public	health	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 show 	 s 	 	you	to	be	the	 rich 	 est 	 	and	the	 strong 	 est 	 	,	and	to	be	 king 	 s 	 	and	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	did	not	protect	you	from	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	 small 	 pox 	 	.
never	can	you	doubt	that	we	are	all	in	 th 	 is 	 	together	.
but	to	see	 small 	 pox 	 	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	a	sovereign	is	the	wrong	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
you	should	see	it	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	a	mother	 watch 	 ing 	 	her	child	develop	 th 	 is 	 	disease	and	 stand 	 ing 	 	by	 help 	 lessly 	 	.
day	one	,	day	two	,	day	three	,	day	four	,	day	five	,	day	six	.
you	're	a	mother	and	you	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	child	,	and	on	day	six	,	you	see	 pustu 	 les 	 	that	 be 	 come 	 	hard	.
day	seven	,	they	show	the	classic	 scar 	 s 	 	of	 small 	 pox 	 	 umbilic 	 ation 	 	.
day	eight	.
and	al	gore	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	that	the	most	 photograph 	 ed 	 	image	in	the	world	,	the	most	 print 	 ed 	 	image	in	the	world	,	was	that	of	the	earth	.	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	in	1974	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	of	that	moment	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	was	the	photograph	that	was	the	most	 wide 	 ly 	 	 print 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 print 	 ed 	 	two	billion	copies	of	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	,	and	we	took	them	hand	to	hand	,	door	to	door	,	to	show	people	and	ask	them	if	there	was	 small 	 pox 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	house	 be 	 cause 	 	that	was	our	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	system	.	we	did	n't	have	google	;	we	did	n't	have	web	 crawl 	 ers 	 	;	we	did	n't	have	 computer 	 s 	 	.
by	day	nine	,	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	and	you	're	 horr 	 ified 	 	.
i	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	picture	and	i	say	,	``	thank	god	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	clear	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	case	of	 small 	 pox 	 	,	and	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	child	will	live	.
and	by	day	13	,	the	 les 	 ions 	 	are	 s 	 cab 	 bing 	 	,	his	 eye 	 lids 	 	are	swollen	,	but	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	child	 ha 	 s 	 	no	other	 second 	 ary 	 	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
and	by	day	20	,	while	he	will	be	 scar 	 red 	 	for	life	,	he	will	live	.
there	are	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 small 	 pox 	 	that	are	not	like	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 con 	 fluent 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	,	in	which	there	is	n't	a	single	place	on	the	body	where	you	could	put	a	finger	and	not	be	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	 les 	 ions 	 	.
flat	 small 	 pox 	 	,	which	 kill 	 ed 	 	100	percent	of	people	who	got	it	.
and	 hemorrh 	 agic 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	,	the	most	cruel	of	all	,	which	had	a	 pre 	 d 	 ile 	 ction 	 	for	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	.
i	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	had	50	women	die	.	they	all	had	 hemorrh 	 agic 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	.
i	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 body 	 	die	from	it	who	was	n't	a	 pregn 	 ant 	 	woman	.
in	1967	,	the	who	 embark 	 ed 	 	on	what	was	an	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	program	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	a	disease	.
in	that	year	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	34	 count 	 ries 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	with	 small 	 pox 	 	.
by	1970	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	down	to	18	 count 	 ries 	 	.
1974	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	down	to	five	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	in	that	year	,	 small 	 pox 	 	 explode 	 d 	 	 through 	 out 	 	india	.
and	india	was	the	place	where	 small 	 pox 	 	made	 it 	 s 	 	last	stand	.
in	1974	,	india	had	a	population	of	600	million	.
there	are	21	 linguist 	 ic 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	india	,	which	is	like	 say 	 ing 	 	21	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
there	are	20	million	people	on	the	road	at	any	time	in	 bus 	 es 	 	and	 train 	 s 	 	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	500,000	 village 	 s 	 	,	120	million	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	,	and	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 want 	 ed 	 	to	report	if	they	had	a	case	of	 small 	 pox 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	house	 be 	 cause 	 	they	thought	that	 small 	 pox 	 	was	the	 visit 	 ation 	 	of	a	 de 	 ity 	 	,	shitala	mata	,	the	 cool 	 ing 	 	mother	,	and	it	was	wrong	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 strange 	 rs 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	house	when	the	 de 	 ity 	 	was	in	the	house	.	no	incentive	to	report	 small 	 pox 	 	.
it	was	n't	just	india	that	had	 small 	 pox 	 	 de 	 ities 	 	;	 small 	 pox 	 	 de 	 ities 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 valent 	 	all	over	the	world	.
so	,	how	we	 eradic 	 ated 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	was	--	max	 vaccin 	 ation 	 	would	n't	work	.
you	could	 vaccin 	 ate 	 	 every 	 body 	 	in	india	,	but	one	year	 lat 	 er 	 	there	'll	be	21	million	new	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	which	was	then	the	population	of	canada	.
it	would	n't	do	just	to	 vaccin 	 ate 	 	 every 	 one 	 	.
you	had	to	find	every	single	case	of	 small 	 pox 	 	in	the	world	at	the	same	time	and	draw	a	circle	of	 immun 	 ity 	 	around	it	.
and	that	's	what	we	did	.
in	india	 al 	 one 	 	,	my	150,000	best	 friend 	 s 	 	and	i	went	door	to	door	with	that	same	picture	to	every	single	house	in	india	.	we	made	over	one	billion	house	 call 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	process	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
every	time	we	did	a	house	-	to	-	house	search	,	we	had	a	spike	in	the	number	of	 report 	 s 	 	of	 small 	 pox 	 	.
when	we	did	n't	search	,	we	had	the	illusion	that	there	was	no	disease	.
when	we	did	search	,	we	had	the	illusion	that	there	was	more	disease	.
a	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	system	was	 necess 	 ary 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	 need 	 ed 	 	was	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	early	 respons 	 e 	 	.
so	,	we	 search 	 ed 	 	and	we	 search 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	found	every	case	of	 small 	 pox 	 	in	india	.	we	had	a	reward	.
we	raised	the	reward	.	we	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	reward	.
we	had	a	 score 	 card 	 	that	we	wrote	on	every	house	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	did	that	,	the	number	of	 report 	 ed 	 	 case 	 s 	 	in	the	world	 drop 	 ped 	 	to	zero	,	and	in	1980	we	 declare 	 d 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	free	of	 small 	 pox 	 	.
it	was	the	largest	campaign	in	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	.
150,000	people	from	all	over	the	world	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	of	every	race	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	culture	and	nation	,	who	 f 	 ought 	 	side	by	side	,	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	,	with	each	other	,	not	against	each	other	,	in	a	common	cause	to	make	the	world	better	.
but	 small 	 pox 	 	was	the	fourth	disease	that	was	 intend 	 ed 	 	for	 eradic 	 ation 	 	.
we	 fail 	 ed 	 	three	other	 time 	 s 	 	.
we	 fail 	 ed 	 	against	malaria	,	yellow	 f 	 ever 	 	and	 yaw 	 s 	 	.
but	soon	we	may	see	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ated 	 	.
but	the	key	to	 eradic 	 ating 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	is	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	early	 respons 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	be	the	year	we	 eradic 	 ate 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	--	that	will	make	it	the	second	disease	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	david	heymann	,	who	's	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	 web 	 cast 	 	--	david	,	keep	on	going	.	we	're	close	.	we	're	down	to	four	 count 	 ries 	 	.
i	feel	like	hank	aaron	.	barry	 bond 	 s 	 	can	replace	me	any	time	.
let	's	get	 an 	 other 	 	disease	off	the	list	of	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	worry	about	.
i	was	just	in	india	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	 poli 	 o 	 	program	.
the	 poli 	 o 	 	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	program	is	four	million	people	going	door	to	door	.
that	is	the	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	system	.
but	we	need	to	have	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	early	 respons 	 e 	 	.
 blind 	 ness 	 	,	the	same	thing	.	the	key	to	 discover 	 ing 	 	 blind 	 ness 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 epidemio 	 logical 	 	 survey 	 s 	 	and	 find 	 ing 	 	out	the	 cause 	 s 	 	of	 blind 	 ness 	 	so	you	can	mount	the	correct	 respons 	 e 	 	.
the	seva	 found 	 ation 	 	was	 start 	 ed 	 	by	a	group	of	 al 	 um 	 ni 	 	of	the	 small 	 pox 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	program	who	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 climb 	 ed 	 	the	highest	mountain	,	 taste 	 d 	 	the	elixir	of	the	success	of	 eradic 	 ating 	 	a	disease	,	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	over	the	last	27	 year 	 s 	 	,	seva	's	 program 	 s 	 	in	15	 count 	 ries 	 	have	 give 	 n 	 	back	sight	to	more	than	two	million	blind	people	.
seva	got	 start 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 app 	 ly 	 	these	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	of	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	and	 epidemio 	 logy 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 no 	 body 	 	else	was	looking	at	 a 	 s 	 	a	public	health	issue	:	 blind 	 ness 	 	,	which	 here 	 to 	 fore 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	thought	of	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	disease	.
in	1980	,	steve	 job 	 s 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	that	computer	,	which	is	apple	number	12	,	and	it	's	still	in	kathmandu	,	and	it	's	still	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	ought	to	go	get	it	and	auction	it	off	and	make	more	money	for	seva	.
and	we	 conduct 	 ed 	 	the	first	nepal	survey	ever	 d 	 one 	 	for	health	,	and	the	first	 nation 	 wide 	 	 blind 	 ness 	 	survey	ever	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	we	had	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 find 	 ing 	 	out	what	we	thought	was	the	case	--	that	 blind 	 ness 	 	was	 caus 	 ed 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	by	glaucoma	and	 tra 	 choma 	 	--	we	 we 	 re 	 	 astound 	 ed 	 	to	find	out	that	 blind 	 ness 	 	was	 caus 	 ed 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	by	cataract	.
you	ca	n't	cure	or	prevent	what	you	do	n't	know	is	there	.
in	your	ted	 package 	 s 	 	there	's	a	dvd	,	``	infinite	vision	,	``	about	dr.	v	and	the	aravind	eye	hospital	.
i	hope	that	you	will	take	a	look	at	it	.
aravind	,	which	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	seva	project	,	is	now	the	world	's	largest	and	best	eye	hospital	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	,	that	one	hospital	will	give	back	sight	to	more	than	300,000	people	in	tamil	nadu	,	india	.
bird	flu	.	i	stand	here	 a 	 s 	 	a	 represent 	 ative 	 	of	all	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	might	be	the	worst	.
the	key	to	 prevent 	 ing 	 	or	 mitig 	 ating 	 	 pan 	 demic 	 	bird	flu	is	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	and	rapid	 respons 	 e 	 	.
we	will	not	have	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	or	 ad 	 equate 	 	 suppli 	 es 	 	of	an	 anti 	 viral 	 	to	combat	bird	flu	if	it	 occur 	 s 	 	in	the	next	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
who	 stage 	 s 	 	the	progress	of	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
we	are	now	at	stage	three	on	the	 pan 	 demic 	 	alert	stage	,	with	just	a	little	bit	of	human	-	to	-	human	 trans 	 mission 	 	,	but	no	human	-	to	-	human	-	to	-	human	 sustain 	 ed 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
the	moment	who	 say 	 s 	 	we	've	 move 	 d 	 	to	 categor 	 y 	 	four	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	not	be	like	katrina	.	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	will	stop	.
there	'll	be	no	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
would	you	get	in	an	 air 	 plane 	 	with	250	people	you	did	n't	know	,	 cough 	 ing 	 	and	 sneez 	 ing 	 	,	when	you	 k 	 new 	 	that	some	of	them	might	carry	a	disease	that	could	kill	you	,	for	which	you	had	no	 anti 	 viral 	 s 	 	or	 vaccin 	 e 	 	?
i	did	a	 stud 	 y 	 	of	the	top	 epidemio 	 logists 	 	in	the	world	in	october	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	--	these	are	all	 fluo 	 logists 	 	and	 special 	 ists 	 	in	influenza	--	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	the	 question 	 s 	 	you	'd	like	to	ask	them	.
what	do	you	think	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	is	that	there	'll	be	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	?

15	percent	 s 	 aid 	 	they	thought	there	'd	be	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	 with 	 in 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	that	,	90	percent	 s 	 aid 	 	they	thought	there	'd	be	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	 with 	 in 	 	your	children	or	your	 grand 	 children 	 	's	 life 	 time 	 	.
and	they	thought	that	if	there	was	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	,	a	billion	people	would	get	sick	.
 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	165	million	people	would	die	.
there	would	be	a	global	 recess 	 ion 	 	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	just	-	in	-	time	 inventor 	 y 	 	system	and	the	tight	rubber	band	of	 global 	 ization 	 	broke	,	and	the	cost	to	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	one	to	three	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	would	be	far	 wo 	 rse 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	than	 mere 	 ly 	 	100	million	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	more	people	would	lose	 the 	 ir 	 	job	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 health 	 care 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	that	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 most 	 	 un 	 think 	 able 	 	.
and	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	travel	is	 get 	 ting 	 	so	much	better	.
let	me	show	you	a	 simul 	 ation 	 	of	what	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	so	we	know	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
let	's	 assum 	 e 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	that	the	first	case	 occur 	 s 	 	in	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
it	 initi 	 ally 	 	 go 	 es 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
you	get	two	or	three	discrete	 location 	 s 	 	.
then	there	'll	be	 second 	 ary 	 	 out 	 break 	 s 	 	,	and	the	disease	will	spread	from	country	to	country	so	fast	that	you	wo	n't	know	what	hit	you	.
 with 	 in 	 	three	 week 	 s 	 	it	will	be	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
now	,	if	we	had	an	``	 un 	 do 	 	``	button	,	and	we	could	go	back	and	isolate	it	and	grab	it	when	it	first	 start 	 ed 	 	.	if	we	could	find	it	early	,	and	we	had	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	and	early	 respons 	 e 	 	,	and	we	could	put	each	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	viruses	in	jail	--	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	deal	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
and	let	me	show	you	why	that	is	.
we	have	a	joke	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 epi 	 demic 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	in	medicine	,	i	think	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	to	know	what	it	is	.
but	the	joke	is	,	an	 epidemio 	 logist 	 	 like 	 s 	 	to	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	an	 epi 	 demic 	 	right	here	and	ride	to	 glor 	 y 	 	on	the	 down 	 hill 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	.
but	you	do	n't	get	to	do	that	 usual 	 ly 	 	.
you	 usual 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 e 	 	right	about	here	.
what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	is	to	 arriv 	 e 	 	right	here	,	so	we	can	stop	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
but	you	ca	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	do	that	.	but	there	's	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	find	a	way	to	learn	when	the	first	 case 	 s 	 	occur	,	and	that	is	 call 	 ed 	 	gphin	.
it	's	the	global	public	health	information	network	.
and	that	 simul 	 ation 	 	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	that	you	thought	was	bird	flu	--	that	was	sars	.	and	sars	is	the	 pan 	 demic 	 	that	did	not	occur	.
and	it	did	n't	occur	 be 	 cause 	 	gphin	found	the	 pan 	 demic 	 	-	to	-	be	of	sars	three	 month 	 s 	 	before	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 announce 	 d 	 	it	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	stop	the	sars	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
and	i	think	we	owe	a	great	debt	of	 grat 	 itude 	 	to	gphin	and	to	ron	st.	john	,	who	i	hope	is	in	the	audience	some	place	--	over	there	--	who	's	the	founder	of	gphin	.
 hell 	 o 	 	,	ron	.
and	ted	 ha 	 s 	 	 flow 	 n 	 	ron	here	from	ottawa	,	where	gphin	is	 locate 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	gphin	find	sars	early	,	but	you	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	last	week	that	iran	 announce 	 d 	 	that	they	had	bird	flu	in	iran	,	but	gphin	found	the	bird	flu	in	iran	not	february	14	but	last	september	.
we	need	an	early	-	 war 	 ning 	 	system	to	protect	us	against	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 human 	 ity 	 	's	worst	nightmare	.
and	so	my	ted	wish	is	based	on	the	common	 denomi 	 nator 	 	of	these	 experience 	 s 	 	.
 small 	 pox 	 	--	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	early	 respons 	 e 	 	.
 blind 	 ness 	 	,	 poli 	 o 	 	--	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	early	 respons 	 e 	 	.
 pan 	 demic 	 	bird	flu	--	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	early	 respons 	 e 	 	.	it	is	a	 lit 	 any 	 	.
it	is	so	obvious	that	our	 on 	 ly 	 	way	of	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	these	new	 disease 	 s 	 	is	to	find	them	early	and	to	kill	them	before	they	spread	.
so	,	my	ted	wish	is	for	you	to	help	build	a	global	system	,	an	early	-	 war 	 ning 	 	system	,	to	protect	us	against	 human 	 ity 	 	's	worst	 nightmare 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	thought	i	would	call	it	is	``	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	``	but	it	should	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 call 	 ed 	 	``	total	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	.	``
but	in	all	 serious 	 ness 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	is	 birth 	 ed 	 	in	ted	,	i	would	like	it	to	be	a	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	ted	,	and	i	'd	like	to	call	it	the	``	 inter 	 national 	 	system	for	total	early	disease	 detect 	 ion 	 	.	``
and	instedd	then	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	our	 man 	 tra 	 	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	 hid 	 den 	 	 pan 	 demic 	 	of	bird	flu	,	we	find	it	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	contain	it	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	novel	virus	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	bio	-	terror	or	bio	-	error	,	or	shift	or	drift	,	we	find	it	,	and	we	contain	it	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	industrial	 accident 	 s 	 	like	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	or	the	 catastroph 	 e 	 	in	bhopal	,	we	find	them	,	and	we	respond	to	them	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	famine	,	 hid 	 den 	 	 un 	 til 	 	it	is	too	late	,	we	detect	it	,	and	we	respond	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	system	,	which	is	owned	by	a	government	and	 hid 	 den 	 	in	the	 bowel 	 s 	 	of	government	,	let	's	build	an	early	 detect 	 ion 	 	system	that	's	 free 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	world	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	language	.
let	's	make	it	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	non	-	 government 	 al 	 	,	not	owned	by	any	single	country	or	company	,	 house 	 d 	 	in	a	neutral	country	,	with	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ant 	 	 back 	 up 	 	in	a	different	time	zone	and	a	different	continent	,	and	let	's	build	it	on	gphin	.	let	's	start	with	gphin	.
let	's	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	that	they	crawl	from	20,000	to	20	million	.
let	's	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 language 	 s 	 	they	crawl	from	seven	to	70	,	or	more	.
let	's	build	in	 out 	 bound 	 	 confirm 	 ation 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	using	text	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	or	sms	or	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	to	find	out	from	people	who	are	 with 	 in 	 	100	 meter 	 s 	 	of	the	rumor	that	you	hear	if	it	is	,	in	fact	,	valid	.
and	let	's	add	satellite	 confirm 	 ation 	 	.
and	we	'll	add	gapminder	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 graphic 	 s 	 	to	the	front	end	.
and	we	'll	grow	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	moral	force	in	the	world	,	 find 	 ing 	 	out	 t 	 hose 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	before	 any 	 body 	 	else	 know 	 s 	 	about	them	,	and	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	our	 respons 	 e 	 	to	them	.	so	that	next	year	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	us	 meet 	 ing 	 	here	,	 lament 	 ing 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	there	are	in	the	world	,	we	will	have	 pull 	 ed 	 	together	,	used	the	 un 	 ique 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	and	the	magic	of	 th 	 is 	 	community	,	and	be	proud	that	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	we	can	to	stop	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	,	other	 catastroph 	 es 	 	,	and	change	the	world	 begin 	 ning 	 	right	now	.
chris	anderson	:	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.	first	of	all	,	just	so	 every 	 one 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	,	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	that	by	building	--	by	creating	web	 crawl 	 ers 	 	,	looking	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	for	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	they	can	detect	 some 	 thing 	 	suspicious	before	who	,	before	 any 	 one 	 	else	can	see	it	?
just	explain	.	give	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	that	could	possibly	be	true	.
larry	 brilli 	 ant 	 	:	first	of	all	,	you	're	not	mad	about	the	 copy 	 right 	 	 viol 	 ation 	 	?
ca	:	no	.	i	love	it	.
lb	:	well	,	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	ron	st.	john	--	i	hope	you	'll	go	and	meet	him	in	the	 d 	 inner 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	and	talk	to	him	--	when	he	 start 	 ed 	 	gphin	--	in	1997	,	there	was	an	 out 	 break 	 	of	bird	flu	.
h	5n1	.	it	was	in	hong	kong	.	and	a	 remark 	 able 	 	doctor	in	hong	kong	 respond 	 ed 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	by	 s 	 laughter 	 ing 	 	1.5	million	 chicken 	 s 	 	and	 bird 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 stop 	 ped 	 	that	 out 	 break 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 track 	 s 	 	.
 im 	 mediate 	 	 detect 	 ion 	 	,	 im 	 mediate 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
then	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	went	by	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	 rumor 	 s 	 	about	bird	flu	.
ron	and	his	team	in	ottawa	 beg 	 an 	 	to	crawl	the	web	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 crawl 	 ing 	 	20,000	different	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	 period 	 ical 	 s 	 	,	and	they	read	about	and	heard	about	a	concern	of	a	lot	of	children	who	had	high	 f 	 ever 	 	and	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	bird	flu	.
they	 report 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	who	.	who	took	a	little	while	taking	action	 be 	 cause 	 	who	will	 on 	 ly 	 	 receiv 	 e 	 	a	report	from	a	government	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	point	to	who	and	let	them	know	that	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	surprising	and	 un 	 explain 	 ed 	 	cluster	of	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	that	 look 	 ed 	 	like	bird	flu	.
that	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	sars	.
that	's	how	the	world	found	out	about	sars	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	stop	sars	.
now	,	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	,	before	there	was	gphin	,	100	percent	of	all	the	world	's	 report 	 s 	 	of	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	famine	or	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	bird	flu	or	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 eb 	 ola 	 	--	100	percent	of	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 report 	 s 	 	came	from	 nation 	 s 	 	.
the	moment	these	 guy 	 s 	 	in	ottawa	,	on	a	budget	of	800,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	,	got	 crack 	 ing 	 	,	75	percent	of	all	the	 report 	 s 	 	in	the	world	came	from	gphin	,	25	percent	of	all	the	 report 	 s 	 	in	the	world	came	from	all	the	other	180	 nation 	 s 	 	.
now	,	here	's	what	's	real	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	after	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	,	what	do	you	think	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	?
they	felt	 pre 	 tty 	 	stupid	,	so	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 report 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
now	 the 	 ir 	 	 report 	 ing 	 	 percent 	 age 	 	is	down	to	50	percent	 be 	 cause 	 	other	 nation 	 s 	 	have	 start 	 ed 	 	to	report	.
so	,	can	you	find	 disease 	 s 	 	early	by	 crawl 	 ing 	 	the	web	?
of	course	you	can	.	can	you	find	it	even	 ear 	 lier 	 	than	gphin	 do 	 es 	 	now	?
of	course	you	can	.	you	saw	that	they	found	sars	using	 the 	 ir 	 	chinese	web	 crawl 	 er 	 	a	full	six	 week 	 s 	 	before	they	found	it	using	 the 	 ir 	 	english	web	 crawl 	 er 	 	.
well	,	they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 crawl 	 ing 	 	in	seven	 language 	 s 	 	.
these	bad	viruses	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	have	any	 intent 	 ion 	 	of	 show 	 ing 	 	up	first	in	english	or	spanish	or	french	.
so	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	want	to	take	gphin	;	i	want	to	build	on	it	;	i	want	to	add	all	the	 language 	 s 	 	of	the	world	that	we	possibly	can	;	i	want	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	open	to	 every 	 body 	 	so	that	the	health	officer	in	nairobi	or	in	patna	,	bihar	will	have	 a 	 s 	 	much	access	to	it	 a 	 s 	 	the	 folk 	 s 	 	in	ottawa	or	in	cdc	;	and	i	want	to	make	it	part	of	our	culture	that	there	is	a	community	of	people	who	are	 watch 	 ing 	 	out	for	the	worst	 nightmare 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	,	and	that	it	's	 access 	 ible 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	.
