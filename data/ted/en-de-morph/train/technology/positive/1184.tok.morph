so	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	food	for	a	long	time	.
i	taught	 my 	 self 	 	to	cook	with	a	bunch	of	big	 book 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	went	to	chef	school	in	france	.
and	there	is	a	way	the	world	both	 envision 	 s 	 	food	,	the	way	the	world	 write 	 s 	 	about	food	and	 learn 	 s 	 	about	food	.
and	it	's	 large 	 ly 	 	what	you	would	find	in	these	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
but	there	's	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	since	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	food	was	 establish 	 ed 	 	.
in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	people	have	 real 	 ized 	 	that	science	 ha 	 s 	 	a	tremendous	amount	to	do	with	food	.
in	fact	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	why	 cook 	 ing 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	the	science	of	 cook 	 ing 	 	--	some	of	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	some	of	the	physics	and	so	forth	.
but	that	's	not	in	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	tremendous	number	of	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	 chef 	 s 	 	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	some	about	new	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	,	new	 approach 	 es 	 	to	food	.
there	's	a	chef	in	spain	named	ferran	adria	.
he	's	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	avant	-	garde	 cu 	 is 	 ine 	 	.
a	guy	in	england	 call 	 ed 	 	heston	blumenthal	,	he	's	 develop 	 ed 	 	his	avant	-	garde	 cu 	 is 	 ine 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	these	people	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	over	the	course	of	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	is	in	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	them	are	taught	in	 cook 	 ing 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
in	order	to	learn	them	,	you	have	to	go	work	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 restaurant 	 s 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	the	old	way	of	 view 	 ing 	 	food	is	the	old	way	.
and	so	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	 four 	 s 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	i	set	out	to	say	,	is	there	a	way	we	can	communicate	science	and	 techni 	 que 	 	and	wonder	?
is	there	a	way	we	can	show	people	food	in	a	way	they	have	not	 s 	 een 	 	it	before	?
so	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	'll	show	you	what	we	came	up	with	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 cut 	 away 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	first	picture	i	took	in	the	book	.
the	idea	here	is	to	explain	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	 s 	 team 	 	 broc 	 coli 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	magic	view	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	see	all	of	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	while	the	 broc 	 coli 	 	 s 	 team 	 s 	 	.
then	each	of	the	different	little	 piece 	 s 	 	around	it	explain	some	fact	.
and	the	hope	was	two	-	fold	.
one	is	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	explain	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	 s 	 team 	 	 broc 	 coli 	 	.
but	the	other	thing	is	that	 may 	 be 	 	we	could	seduce	people	 in 	 to 	 	stuff	that	was	a	little	more	technical	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	bit	more	scientific	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	bit	more	chef	-	y	than	they	 other 	 wise 	 	would	have	.
 be 	 cause 	 	with	that	 beaut 	 iful 	 	photo	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	can	 al 	 so 	 	package	 th 	 is 	 	little	box	here	that	 talk 	 s 	 	about	how	 s 	 team 	 ing 	 	and	 boil 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	different	 amount 	 s 	 	of	time	.
 s 	 team 	 ing 	 	ought	to	be	 fast 	 er 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	is	n't	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	film	 condens 	 ation 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	that	.
well	,	that	first	 cut 	 away 	 	picture	 work 	 ed 	 	,	so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	let	's	do	some	more	.	``
so	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
we	 discover 	 ed 	 	why	 wok 	 s 	 	are	the	shape	they	are	.
 th 	 is 	 	shaped	wok	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 ver 	 y 	 	well	;	 th 	 is 	 	caught	fire	three	 time 	 s 	 	.
but	we	had	a	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	which	is	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	look	good	for	a	 thousand 	 th 	 	of	a	second	.
and	one	of	our	canning	 cut 	 away 	 s 	 	.
once	you	start	cutting	 thing 	 s 	 	in	half	,	you	kind	of	get	carried	away	,	so	you	see	we	cut	the	 jar 	 s 	 	in	half	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	pan	.
and	each	of	these	text	 block 	 s 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	a	key	thing	that	's	going	on	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 boil 	 ing 	 	water	canning	is	for	canning	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 acid 	 ic 	 	.
you	do	n't	have	to	heat	them	up	 a 	 s 	 	hot	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	 some 	 thing 	 	you	do	pressure	canning	 be 	 cause 	 	bacterial	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	ca	n't	grow	in	the	acid	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	for	 pick 	 led 	 	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	,	which	is	what	we	're	canning	here	.
here	's	our	 ham 	 burger 	 	 cut 	 away 	 	.
one	of	our	 philosoph 	 ies 	 	in	the	book	is	that	no	dish	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	any	better	than	any	other	dish	.
so	you	can	lavish	all	the	same	care	,	all	the	same	 techni 	 que 	 	,	on	a	 ham 	 burger 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	on	some	much	more	 f 	 ancy 	 	dish	.
and	if	you	do	lavish	 a 	 s 	 	much	 techni 	 que 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	and	you	try	to	make	the	highest	quality	 ham 	 burger 	 	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	be	a	little	bit	 involve 	 d 	 	.
the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	ran	a	piece	after	my	book	was	 delay 	 ed 	 	and	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	wait	for	the	30	-	hour	 ham 	 burger 	 	just	got	 long 	 er 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	our	 ham 	 burger 	 	recipe	,	our	ultimate	 ham 	 burger 	 	recipe	,	if	you	make	the	 bun 	 s 	 	and	you	 marin 	 ate 	 	the	meat	and	you	do	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	take	about	30	 hour 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	you	're	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	the	whole	time	.
most	of	the	time	is	kind	of	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	.
the	point	of	 th 	 is 	 	 cut 	 away 	 	is	to	show	people	a	view	of	 ham 	 burger 	 s 	 	they	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	before	and	to	explain	the	physics	of	 ham 	 burger 	 s 	 	and	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	of	 ham 	 burger 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	physics	and	 chemist 	 ry 	 	--	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 flame 	 s 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	the	burger	.
most	of	the	 character 	 istic 	 	char	-	 grill 	 ed 	 	taste	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	from	the	wood	or	the	 char 	 coal 	 	.
 buy 	 ing 	 	 me 	 s 	 quit 	 e 	 	 char 	 coal 	 	will	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	that	much	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 most 	 ly 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	fat	 pyrolyz 	 ing 	 	,	or	 burn 	 ing 	 	.
so	it	's	the	fat	that	 drip 	 s 	 	down	and	 flare 	 s 	 	up	that	 cause 	 s 	 	the	 character 	 istic 	 	taste	.
now	you	might	wonder	,	how	do	we	make	these	 cut 	 away 	 s 	 	?
most	people	 assum 	 e 	 	we	use	photoshop	.
and	the	answer	is	:	no	,	not	 re 	 ally 	 	;	we	use	a	machine	shop	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	the	best	way	to	cut	 thing 	 s 	 	in	half	is	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	cut	them	in	half	.
so	we	have	two	 halv 	 es 	 	of	one	of	the	best	 kitchen 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
we	cut	a	$	5,000	restaurant	oven	in	half	.
the	 manufactur 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	would	it	take	for	you	to	cut	one	in	half	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	would	have	to	show	up	free	.	``
and	so	it	 show 	 ed 	 	up	,	we	used	it	a	little	while	,	we	cut	it	in	half	.
now	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	a	little	bit	how	we	did	some	of	these	 shot 	 s 	 	.
we	would	glue	a	piece	of	pyrex	or	heat	-	resistant	glass	in	front	.
we	used	a	red	,	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	temperature	silicon	to	do	that	.
the	great	thing	is	,	when	you	cut	 some 	 thing 	 	in	half	,	you	have	 an 	 other 	 	half	.
so	you	photograph	that	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	position	,	and	then	you	can	 substitut 	 e 	 	in	--	and	that	part	 do 	 es 	 	use	photoshop	--	just	the	 edge 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	in	a	hollywood	movie	where	a	guy	flies	through	the	air	,	 support 	 ed 	 	by	 wire 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	take	the	 wire 	 s 	 	away	 digital 	 ly 	 	so	you	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	through	the	air	.
in	most	 case 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	there	was	no	glass	.
like	for	the	 ham 	 burger 	 	,	we	just	cut	the	damn	barbecue	.
and	so	 t 	 hose 	 	 coal 	 s 	 	that	 ke 	 pt 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	off	the	edge	,	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	put	them	back	up	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	work	for	a	 thousand 	 th 	 	of	a	second	.
the	wok	shot	caught	fire	three	 time 	 s 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	have	your	wok	cut	in	half	is	the	oil	 go 	 es 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	fire	and	 who 	 osh 	 	!
one	of	our	 cook 	 s 	 	lost	his	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	that	way	.
but	 he 	 y 	 	,	they	grow	back	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 cut 	 away 	 s 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	explain	physics	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	fourier	's	law	of	heat	 conduct 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	a	partial	 different 	 ial 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
we	have	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 cook 	 book 	 	in	the	world	that	 ha 	 s 	 	partial	 different 	 ial 	 	 equ 	 ations 	 	in	it	.
but	to	make	them	 pala 	 table 	 	,	we	cut	it	out	of	a	steel	plate	and	put	it	in	front	of	a	fire	and	 photograph 	 ed 	 	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	've	got	 lot 	 s 	 	of	little	 tid 	 bits 	 	in	the	book	.
 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	your	 vari 	 ous 	 	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	have	 watt 	 age 	 	,	right	?
but	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	n't	know	that	much	about	james	watt	.
but	now	you	will	;	we	put	a	 bio 	 graphy 	 	of	james	watt	in	.
it	's	a	little	couple	 para 	 graph 	 s 	 	to	explain	why	we	call	that	unit	of	heat	the	watt	,	and	where	he	got	his	inspiration	.
it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	he	was	 hire 	 d 	 	by	a	scottish	 distill 	 ery 	 	to	understand	why	they	 we 	 re 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	so	damn	much	 pe 	 at 	 	to	distill	the	 whisk 	 ey 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	did	a	lot	of	 calcul 	 ation 	 	.
i	 personal 	 ly 	 	wrote	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	lines	of	code	to	write	 th 	 is 	 	 cook 	 book 	 	.
here	's	a	 calcul 	 ation 	 	that	 show 	 s 	 	how	the	 intens 	 ity 	 	of	a	barbecue	,	or	other	 radi 	 ant 	 	heat	source	,	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	away	from	it	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	 vert 	 ically 	 	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	surface	,	the	heat	 fall 	 s 	 	off	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	move	side	to	side	,	it	 move 	 s 	 	off	.
that	horn	-	shaped	region	is	what	we	call	the	sweet	spot	.
that	's	the	place	where	the	heat	is	even	to	 with 	 in 	 	10	percent	.
so	that	's	the	place	where	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	cook	.
and	it	's	got	 th 	 is 	 	funny	horn	-	shaped	thing	,	which	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	know	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	first	 cook 	 book 	 	to	ever	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	it	may	 al 	 so 	 	be	the	last	 cook 	 book 	 	that	ever	 do 	 es 	 	it	.
you	know	,	there	's	two	ways	you	can	make	a	product	.
you	can	do	 lot 	 s 	 	of	market	research	and	do	focus	 group 	 s 	 	and	figure	out	what	people	 re 	 ally 	 	want	,	or	you	can	just	kind	of	go	for	it	and	make	the	book	you	want	and	hope	other	people	like	it	.
here	's	a	step	-	by	-	step	that	 show 	 s 	 	 grind 	 ing 	 	 ham 	 burger 	 	.
if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	great	 ham 	 burger 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	if	you	align	the	grain	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	here	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 grind 	 er 	 	,	you	just	have	a	little	tray	,	and	you	just	take	it	off	in	little	 pass 	 es 	 	,	build	it	up	,	slice	it	 vert 	 ically 	 	.
here	's	the	final	 ham 	 burger 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	30	-	hour	 ham 	 burger 	 	.
we	make	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	burger	.
the	lettuce	 ha 	 s 	 	got	liquid	smoke	 in 	 fused 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 thing 	 s 	 	about	how	to	make	the	bun	.
there	's	a	mushroom	,	 k 	 etch 	 up 	 	--	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	and	on	.
now	watch	 close 	 ly 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pop 	 corn 	 	.	i	'll	explain	it	here	.
the	 pop 	 corn 	 	is	 illustr 	 ating 	 	a	key	thing	in	physics	.
is	n't	that	 beaut 	 iful 	 	?
we	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	speed	camera	,	which	we	had	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 f 	 un 	 	with	on	the	book	.
the	key	physics	principle	here	is	when	water	 boil 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 team 	 	it	 expand 	 s 	 	by	a	factor	of	1,600	.
that	's	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	the	water	 in 	 side 	 	that	 pop 	 corn 	 	.
so	it	's	a	great	 illustr 	 ation 	 	of	that	.
now	i	'm	going	to	close	with	a	video	that	is	kind	of	 un 	 usual 	 	.
we	have	a	chapter	on	 gel 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	people	watch	mythbusters	and	csi	,	i	thought	,	well	,	let	's	put	in	a	recipe	for	a	 ball 	 istic 	 s 	 	gelatin	.
well	,	if	you	have	a	high	-	speed	camera	,	and	you	have	a	block	of	 ball 	 istic 	 s 	 	gelatin	 ly 	 ing 	 	around	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	 some 	 body 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	here	is	that	a	 ball 	 istic 	 s 	 	gelatin	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	mimic	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	human	 fl 	 esh 	 	when	you	get	shot	--	that	's	why	you	should	n't	get	shot	.
the	other	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	is	,	when	 th 	 is 	 	 ball 	 istic 	 s 	 	gelatin	 come 	 s 	 	down	,	it	 fall 	 s 	 	back	down	 a 	 s 	 	a	nice	block	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	here	's	the	book	.
here	it	is	.
2,438	 page 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	nice	big	 page 	 s 	 	too	.
a	friend	of	mine	 complain 	 ed 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	too	big	and	too	 pre 	 tty 	 	to	go	in	the	kitchen	,	so	there	's	a	sixth	volume	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 wash 	 able 	 	,	 water 	 proof 	 	paper	.
