 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	i	present	to	you	the	human	genome	.
 chromosom 	 e 	 	one	,	top	left	.
bottom	right	are	the	 s 	 ex 	 	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
women	have	two	copies	of	that	big	x	 chromosom 	 e 	 	;	men	have	the	x	and	,	of	course	,	that	small	copy	of	the	y	.
sorry	 boy 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	just	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	thing	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	different	.
so	if	you	zoom	in	on	 th 	 is 	 	genome	,	then	what	you	see	,	of	course	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	structure	--	the	code	of	life	 spell 	 ed 	 	out	with	these	four	 bio 	 chemical 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	,	or	we	call	them	 base 	 s 	 	,	right	:	a	,	c	,	g	and	t	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	are	there	in	the	human	genome	?	three	billion	.
is	that	a	big	number	?
well	,	 every 	 body 	 	can	throw	around	big	 number 	 s 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	place	one	base	on	each	pixel	of	 th 	 is 	 	1280	by	800	 re 	 solution 	 	screen	,	we	would	need	3,000	 screen 	 s 	 	to	take	a	look	at	the	genome	.
so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	big	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	,	a	group	of	people	--	all	,	by	the	way	,	with	y	 chromosom 	 es 	 	--	 decide 	 d 	 	they	would	want	to	sequence	it	.
and	so	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	and	about	four	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	genome	was	 sequence 	 d 	 	and	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
in	2003	,	the	final	version	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	and	they	keep	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	.
that	was	all	 d 	 one 	 	on	a	machine	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 cost 	 s 	 	about	a	dollar	for	each	base	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
well	 folk 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	that	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	and	 non 	 e 	 	of	you	know	about	it	.
so	now	what	we	do	is	we	take	a	genome	,	we	make	 may 	 be 	 	50	copies	of	it	,	we	cut	all	 t 	 hose 	 	copies	up	 in 	 to 	 	little	50	-	base	 read 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	sequence	them	,	 massive 	 ly 	 	parallel	.
and	then	we	 br 	 ing 	 	that	 in 	 to 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	and	we	 re 	 assemble 	 	it	and	we	tell	you	what	the	story	is	.
and	so	just	to	give	you	a	picture	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	the	human	genome	project	:	3	 giga 	 base 	 s 	 	,	right	.
one	run	on	one	of	these	 machine 	 s 	 	:	200	 giga 	 base 	 s 	 	in	a	week	.
and	that	200	is	going	to	change	to	600	 th 	 is 	 	summer	,	and	there	's	no	sign	of	 th 	 is 	 	pace	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	.
so	the	price	of	a	base	,	to	sequence	a	base	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 fall 	 en 	 	100	million	 time 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	you	 fill 	 ing 	 	up	your	car	with	gas	in	1998	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	 un 	 til 	 	2011	,	and	now	you	can	drive	to	jupiter	and	back	twice	.
world	population	,	pc	 placement 	 s 	 	,	the	 archiv 	 e 	 	of	all	the	medical	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	moore	's	law	,	the	old	way	of	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	,	and	here	's	all	the	new	stuff	.
 guy 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	log	scale	;	you	do	n't	 typical 	 ly 	 	see	lines	that	go	up	like	that	.
so	the	 world 	 wide 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	sequence	human	 genome 	 s 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	50,000	to	100,000	human	 genome 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	based	on	the	 machine 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 place 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	double	,	triple	or	 may 	 be 	 	quadruple	year	over	year	for	the	 foresee 	 able 	 	future	.
in	fact	,	there	's	one	lab	in	 part 	 icular 	 	that	 represent 	 s 	 	20	percent	of	all	that	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	beijing	 genomic 	 s 	 	institute	.
the	chinese	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	winning	 th 	 is 	 	race	to	the	new	moon	,	by	the	way	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	for	medicine	?
so	a	woman	is	age	37	.
she	 present 	 s 	 	with	stage	2	estrogen	receptor	-	positive	breast	cancer	.
she	is	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	and	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
she	 go 	 es 	 	home	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	she	 come 	 s 	 	back	with	stage	three	c	 ov 	 arian 	 	cancer	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 treat 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	with	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	and	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	.
she	 come 	 s 	 	back	three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	at	age	42	with	more	 ov 	 arian 	 	cancer	,	more	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	.
six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	she	 come 	 s 	 	back	with	 a 	 cute 	 	 myel 	 oid 	 	leukemia	.
she	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 respirator 	 y 	 	failure	and	dies	eight	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	first	,	the	way	in	which	 th 	 is 	 	woman	was	 treat 	 ed 	 	,	in	 a 	 s 	 	little	 a 	 s 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	will	look	like	bloodletting	.
and	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	people	like	my	 col 	 league 	 	,	rick	wilson	,	at	the	genome	institute	at	washington	university	,	who	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	woman	 post 	 mort 	 em 	 	.
and	he	 sequence 	 d 	 	,	he	took	skin	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 health 	 y 	 	skin	,	and	 cancer 	 ous 	 	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	,	and	he	 sequence 	 d 	 	the	whole	 genome 	 s 	 	of	both	of	them	in	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	,	no	big	deal	.
and	then	he	 compar 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 genome 	 s 	 	in	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	and	what	he	found	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	was	a	 delet 	 ion 	 	,	a	2,000	-	base	 delet 	 ion 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	three	billion	 base 	 s 	 	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	gene	 call 	 ed 	 	tp	53	.
if	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 delet 	 er 	 ious 	 	mutation	in	 th 	 is 	 	gene	,	you	're	90	percent	 like 	 ly 	 	to	get	cancer	in	your	life	.
so	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	help	 th 	 is 	 	woman	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	have	severe	,	 pro 	 found 	 	if	you	will	,	 implic 	 ations 	 	to	her	family	.
i	mean	,	if	they	have	the	same	mutation	,	and	they	get	 th 	 is 	 	genetic	test	,	and	they	understand	it	,	then	they	can	go	and	get	regular	 screen 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	catch	cancer	early	and	 potential 	 ly 	 	live	a	 significant 	 ly 	 	 long 	 er 	 	life	.
let	me	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	now	to	the	beery	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	,	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	cerebral	 pal 	 s 	 y 	 	at	the	age	of	two	.
 the 	 ir 	 	mom	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	brave	woman	who	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 match 	 ing 	 	up	,	and	through	some	 hero 	 ic 	 	 effort 	 s 	 	and	a	lot	of	 inter 	 net 	 	 search 	 ing 	 	,	she	was	able	to	 con 	 vince 	 	the	medical	community	that	,	in	fact	,	they	had	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
what	they	had	was	dopa	-	 respons 	 ive 	 	dystonia	.
and	so	they	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	l	-	dopa	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	did	improve	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 total 	 ly 	 	 a 	 symptom 	 atic 	 	.
significant	 problem 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	 gentle 	 man 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	a	guy	named	joe	beery	,	who	was	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	the	cio	of	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	life	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
they	're	one	of	the	two	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	these	massive	whole	genome	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
and	so	what	he	did	was	he	got	his	 kid 	 s 	 	 sequence 	 d 	 	.
and	what	they	found	was	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 mutation 	 s 	 	in	a	gene	 call 	 ed 	 	spr	,	which	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	producing	serotonin	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	on	top	of	l	-	dopa	,	they	 g 	 ave 	 	these	 kid 	 s 	 	a	serotonin	 pre 	 cursor 	 	drug	,	and	they	're	 effective 	 ly 	 	normal	now	.
 guy 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	never	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	whole	genome	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	.
and	at	the	time	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	it	cost	$	100,000	.
 to 	 day 	 	it	's	$	10,000	.	next	year	it	's	$	1,000	.
the	year	after	it	's	$	100	,	give	or	take	a	year	.
that	's	how	fast	 th 	 is 	 	is	moving	.
so	here	's	little	nick	--	 like 	 s 	 	batman	and	squirt	 gun 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	nick	 show 	 s 	 	up	at	the	children	's	hospital	with	 th 	 is 	 	 dis 	 tend 	 ed 	 	 bel 	 ly 	 	like	a	famine	victim	.
and	it	's	not	that	he	's	not	eating	,	it	's	that	when	he	eats	,	his	intestine	 bas 	 ically 	 	 open 	 s 	 	up	and	 fec 	 es 	 	 s 	 pill 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	his	gut	.
so	a	hundred	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	he	 look 	 s 	 	at	his	mom	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	mom	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	pray	for	me	.	i	'm	in	so	much	pain	.	``
his	 pediatric 	 ian 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	have	a	 back 	 ground 	 	in	 clinic 	 al 	 	 genetic 	 s 	 	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	no	idea	what	's	going	on	,	but	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	let	's	get	 th 	 is 	 	kid	's	genome	 sequence 	 d 	 	.	``
and	what	they	find	is	a	single	-	point	mutation	in	a	gene	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 controll 	 ing 	 	 programm 	 ed 	 	cell	death	.
so	the	 theor 	 y 	 	is	that	he	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	some	 immuno 	 logical 	 	 re 	 action 	 	to	what	's	going	on	to	the	food	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	and	that	's	a	natural	 re 	 action 	 	,	which	 cause 	 s 	 	some	 programm 	 ed 	 	cell	death	.
but	the	gene	that	 regulat 	 es 	 	that	down	is	broken	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 inform 	 s 	 	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	a	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	transplant	,	which	he	 under 	 take 	 s 	 	.
and	after	nine	 month 	 s 	 	of	 gr 	 uel 	 ing 	 	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	,	he	's	now	eating	steak	with	a	1	sauce	.
the	prospect	of	using	the	genome	 a 	 s 	 	a	universal	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	is	 up 	 on 	 	us	 to 	 day 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	it	's	here	.
and	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	for	all	of	us	is	that	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	could	live	an	extra	five	,	10	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	one	thing	.
which	is	a	fantastic	story	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	think	about	 human 	 ity 	 	's	 foot 	 print 	 	on	the	planet	and	our	ability	to	keep	up	food	production	.
so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	technology	is	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	grow	new	lines	of	corn	,	wheat	,	soybean	and	other	 crop 	 s 	 	that	are	 high 	 ly 	 	 toler 	 ant 	 	of	drought	,	of	flood	,	of	 pest 	 s 	 	and	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	.
now	look	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	population	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	grow	and	eat	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	 food 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	position	that	i	'll	take	 to 	 day 	 	.
 un 	 less 	 	there	's	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	audience	that	would	like	to	volunteer	to	stop	eating	?
 non 	 e 	 	,	not	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 type 	 writer 	 	,	a	staple	of	every	 desk 	 top 	 	for	 decade 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	the	 type 	 writer 	 	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	 delet 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
and	then	more	general	 version 	 s 	 	of	word	 processor 	 s 	 	came	about	.
but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	a	 disrupt 	 ion 	 	on	top	of	a	 disrupt 	 ion 	 	.
it	was	bob	metcalfe	 invent 	 ing 	 	the	 ether 	 net 	 	and	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	of	all	these	 computer 	 s 	 	that	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	we	had	netscape	,	and	we	had	yahoo	and	we	had	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	entire	 dot 	 com 	 	bubble	.
not	to	worry	 th 	 ough 	 	,	that	was	 quick 	 ly 	 	 rescu 	 ed 	 	by	the	ipod	,	facebook	and	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 ang 	 ry 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	.
look	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	genomic	revolution	 to 	 day 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	are	.
so	what	i	'd	like	you	to	consider	is	:	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	when	these	 dot 	 s 	 	do	n't	represent	the	individual	 base 	 s 	 	of	your	genome	,	but	they	connect	to	 genome 	 s 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	planet	?
so	i	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	had	to	buy	life	 insur 	 ance 	 	.
and	i	was	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	answer	:	a.	i	have	never	had	a	genetic	test	,	b.	i	've	had	one	,	here	you	go	,	and	c.	i	've	had	one	and	i	'm	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	.
 thank 	 fully 	 	,	i	was	able	to	answer	a	,	and	i	say	that	 honest 	 ly 	 	in	case	my	life	 insur 	 ance 	 	agent	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
but	what	would	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	if	i	had	 s 	 aid 	 	c	?
consumer	 application 	 s 	 	for	 genomic 	 s 	 	,	they	will	flourish	.
do	you	want	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	 genetic 	 ally 	 	compatible	with	your	girlfriend	?	 s 	 ure 	 	.

so	 any 	 body 	 	who	's	here	 to 	 day 	 	with	your	significant	other	,	just	turn	over	to	them	and	swab	 the 	 ir 	 	mouth	,	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	the	lab	and	you	'll	know	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.

and	it	 look 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
and	then	she	 challeng 	 es 	 	all	of	her	 competitor 	 s 	 	to	do	the	same	.
do	you	think	that	's	not	going	to	happen	?
do	you	think	it	would	have	 help 	 ed 	 	john	mccain	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	the	audience	have	the	last	name	resnick	like	me	?	raise	your	hand	.
 any 	 body 	 	?	 no 	 body 	 	.
 typical 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	one	or	two	.
so	my	father	's	father	was	one	of	10	resnick	 brother 	 s 	 	.
they	all	 hat 	 ed 	 	each	other	.
and	they	all	 move 	 d 	 	to	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	planet	.
so	it	's	 like 	 ly 	 	that	i	'm	related	to	every	resnick	that	i	ever	meet	,	but	i	do	n't	know	.
but	imagine	if	my	genome	 we 	 re 	 	 de 	 identified 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	and	a	third	cousin	's	genome	was	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	,	and	there	was	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	could	 compar 	 e 	 	these	two	and	make	these	 associ 	 ations 	 	.
not	hard	to	imagine	.	my	company	 ha 	 s 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	right	now	.
and	so	imagine	one	more	thing	:	that	that	 soft 	 ware 	 	is	able	to	ask	both	 part 	 ies 	 	for	mutual	 consent 	 s 	 	,	``	would	you	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	meet	your	third	cousin	?	``
and	if	we	both	say	 y 	 es 	 	,	 vo 	 ila 	 	!	welcome	to	 chromosom 	 ally 	 	linkedin	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	good	thing	,	right	?
you	have	 big 	 ger 	 	 cl 	 an 	 	 gather 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	a	bad	thing	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 father 	 s 	 	in	the	room	?	raise	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	 expert 	 s 	 	think	that	one	to	three	percent	of	you	are	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	father	of	your	child	.
look	--	these	 genome 	 s 	 	,	these	23	 chromosom 	 es 	 	,	they	do	n't	in	any	way	represent	the	quality	of	our	 relationship 	 s 	 	or	the	nature	of	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	yet	.
and	like	any	new	technology	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	in	 human 	 ity 	 	's	 hand 	 s 	 	to	wield	it	for	the	 better 	 ment 	 	of	 man 	 kind 	 	,	or	not	.
and	so	i	urge	you	all	to	wake	up	and	to	tune	in	and	to	influence	the	genomic	revolution	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	around	you	.
thank	you	.
