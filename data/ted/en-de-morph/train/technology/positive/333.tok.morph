i	'm	going	to	try	and	explain	why	it	is	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	understand	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	think	we	do	.
i	'd	like	to	begin	with	four	 question 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	some	sort	of	cultural	thing	for	the	time	of	year	.
that	's	an	in	-	joke	,	by	the	way	.
but	these	four	 question 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	are	 one 	 s 	 	that	people	who	even	know	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	about	science	find	 quit 	 e 	 	hard	.
and	they	're	 question 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	of	science	 tele 	 vision 	 	 produce 	 rs 	 	,	of	 audience 	 s 	 	of	science	 educ 	 ators 	 	--	so	that	's	science	 teacher 	 s 	 	--	and	 al 	 so 	 	of	seven	-	year	-	olds	,	and	i	find	that	the	seven	-	year	-	olds	do	 marginal 	 ly 	 	better	than	the	other	 audience 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 some 	 what 	 	surprising	.
so	the	first	question	,	and	you	might	want	to	write	 th 	 is 	 	down	,	either	on	a	bit	of	paper	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	,	or	a	virtual	piece	of	paper	in	your	head	.	and	,	for	 view 	 ers 	 	at	home	,	you	can	try	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
a	little	seed	 weigh 	 s 	 	next	to	 noth 	 ing 	 	and	a	tree	 weigh 	 s 	 	a	lot	,	right	?
i	think	we	agree	on	that	.	where	 do 	 es 	 	the	tree	get	the	stuff	that	 make 	 s 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	chair	,	right	?	where	 do 	 es 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	come	from	?
and	your	next	question	is	,	can	you	light	a	little	torch	-	bulb	with	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	a	bulb	and	one	piece	of	wire	?
and	would	you	be	able	to	,	kind	of	,	draw	a	--	you	do	n't	have	to	draw	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	but	would	you	be	able	to	draw	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	if	you	had	to	do	it	?	or	would	you	just	say	,	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	possible	?
the	third	question	is	,	why	is	it	 hot 	 ter 	 	in	summer	than	in	winter	?
i	think	we	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	agree	that	it	is	 hot 	 ter 	 	in	summer	than	in	winter	,	but	why	?	and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	would	you	be	able	to	--	and	you	can	sort	of	 s 	 crib 	 ble 	 	it	,	if	you	like	--	 s 	 crib 	 ble 	 	a	plan	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	the	solar	system	,	 show 	 ing 	 	the	shape	of	the	 planet 	 s 	 	'	 orbit 	 s 	 	?
would	you	be	able	to	do	that	?
and	if	you	can	,	just	 s 	 crib 	 ble 	 	a	pattern	.
ok	.	now	,	children	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	not	from	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	often	think	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	common	sense	,	from	experience	of	the	world	around	them	,	from	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	go	on	between	them	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 peer 	 s 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 ers 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	all	of	that	.	experience	.
and	one	of	the	great	 expert 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	,	of	course	,	was	,	bless	him	,	 card 	 in 	 al 	 	wolsey	.	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	what	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	people	's	 head 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	shift	it	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	right	?
i	'm	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	how	he	 di 	 ed 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
was	he	 be 	 headed 	 	in	the	end	,	or	hung	?
now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	which	,	of	course	,	you	've	got	right	,	and	you	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 confer 	 ring 	 	,	and	so	on	.
and	i	--	you	know	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	pick	people	out	and	 humil 	 iate 	 	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	not	in	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 stance 	 	.
a	little	seed	 weigh 	 s 	 	a	lot	and	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	99	percent	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	came	out	of	the	air	.
now	,	i	guarantee	that	about	85	percent	of	you	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 few 	 er 	 	at	ted	,	will	have	 s 	 aid 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	ground	.	and	some	people	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	two	of	you	,	will	come	up	and	 argu 	 e 	 	with	me	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	and	say	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	ground	.
now	,	if	that	was	true	,	we	'd	have	 truck 	 s 	 	going	round	the	country	,	 fill 	 ing 	 	people	's	 garden 	 s 	 	in	with	 s 	 oil 	 	,	it	'd	be	a	fantastic	business	.
but	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	n't	do	that	.
the	mass	of	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	air	.
now	,	i	 pass 	 ed 	 	all	my	biology	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	in	britain	.
i	 pass 	 ed 	 	them	 re 	 ally 	 	well	,	but	i	still	came	out	of	school	 think 	 ing 	 	that	that	stuff	came	out	of	the	ground	.
second	one	:	can	you	light	a	little	torch	-	bulb	with	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	bulb	and	one	piece	of	wire	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	you	can	,	and	i	'll	show	you	in	a	second	how	to	do	that	.
now	,	i	have	some	 ra 	 ther 	 	bad	news	,	which	is	that	i	had	a	piece	of	video	that	i	was	about	to	show	you	,	which	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	--	the	sound	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	so	i	'm	going	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	to	you	,	in	true	``	monty	python	``	fashion	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	video	.	and	in	the	video	,	a	group	of	 research 	 ers 	 	go	to	mit	on	 gradu 	 ation 	 	day	.
we	chose	mit	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	way	away	from	here	,	and	you	would	n't	mind	too	much	,	but	it	sort	of	 work 	 s 	 	the	same	way	in	britain	and	in	the	west	coast	of	the	usa	.
and	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	these	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	of	science	 graduate 	 s 	 	,	and	they	could	n't	answer	them	.
and	so	,	there	's	a	whole	lot	of	people	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	'd	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	if	you	told	me	that	 th 	 is 	 	came	out	of	the	air	.
that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	to	me	.	``	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	science	 graduate 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 inter 	 cut 	 	it	with	,	``	we	are	the	 pre 	 mi 	 er 	 	science	university	in	the	world	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	of	british	-	like	 hub 	 ris 	 	.
and	when	we	 g 	 ave 	 	graduate	 engineer 	 s 	 	that	question	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	it	could	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	when	we	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	and	a	piece	of	wire	,	and	a	bulb	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	can	you	do	it	?	``	they	could	n't	do	it	.	right	?
and	that	's	no	different	from	imperial	college	in	london	,	by	the	way	,	it	's	not	some	sort	of	anti	-	american	thing	going	on	.
 a 	 s 	 	if	.	now	,	the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	is	we	pay	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	money	for	 teach 	 ing 	 	people	--	we	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	get	it	right	.
and	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	some	 socie 	 tal 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	might	want	people	to	understand	what	it	is	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 photo 	 synthesis 	 	.	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	one	half	of	the	carbon	 equ 	 ation 	 	is	how	much	we	emit	,	and	the	other	half	of	the	carbon	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	conscious	 a 	 s 	 	a	 trust 	 ee 	 	of	kew	,	is	how	much	 thing 	 s 	 	soak	up	,	and	they	soak	up	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	out	of	the	atmosphere	.
that	's	what	 plant 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	for	a	living	.
and	,	for	any	finnish	people	in	the	audience	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	finnish	pun	:	we	are	,	both	 liter 	 ally 	 	and	 metaphor 	 ically 	 	,	 s 	 k 	 ating 	 	on	thin	ice	if	we	do	n't	understand	that	kind	of	thing	.
now	,	here	's	how	you	do	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	and	the	bulb	.
it	's	so	easy	,	is	n't	it	?	of	course	,	you	all	 k 	 new 	 	that	.
but	if	you	have	n't	 play 	 ed 	 	with	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	and	a	bulb	,	if	you	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	circuit	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	you	might	not	be	able	to	do	that	,	and	that	's	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	,	why	is	it	 hot 	 ter 	 	in	summer	than	in	winter	?
we	learn	,	 a 	 s 	 	children	,	that	you	get	 close 	 r 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	hot	,	and	it	 burn 	 s 	 	you	.	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	bit	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	early	on	.
by	 extens 	 ion 	 	,	we	think	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	``	why	it	's	 hot 	 ter 	 	in	summer	than	in	winter	must	be	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	sun.	``
i	promise	you	that	most	of	you	will	have	got	that	.
oh	,	you	're	all	 sha 	 king 	 	your	 head 	 s 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	of	you	are	 sha 	 king 	 	your	 head 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 firm 	 ly 	 	.
other	 one 	 s 	 	are	kind	of	going	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	all	right	.
it	's	 hot 	 ter 	 	in	summer	than	in	winter	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 ray 	 s 	 	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	are	spread	out	more	,	right	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	tilt	of	the	earth	.
and	if	you	think	the	tilt	is	 tilt 	 ing 	 	us	 close 	 r 	 	,	no	,	it	is	n't	.
the	 s 	 un 	 	is	93	million	 mile 	 s 	 	away	,	and	we	're	 tilt 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	right	?
it	 make 	 s 	 	no	 odd 	 s 	 	.	in	fact	,	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	we	're	further	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	in	summer	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 make 	 s 	 	no	 odd 	 s 	 	,	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
ok	,	now	,	the	 s 	 crib 	 ble 	 	of	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	the	solar	system	.
if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	most	of	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	,	that	it	's	 hot 	 ter 	 	in	summer	than	in	winter	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	you	must	have	drawn	an	ellipse	.
right	?	that	would	explain	it	,	right	?
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	in	your	--	you	're	 nod 	 d 	 ing 	 	--	now	,	in	your	ellipse	,	have	you	thought	,	``	well	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	night	?	``
between	australia	and	here	,	right	,	they	've	got	summer	and	we	've	got	winter	,	and	what	--	 do 	 es 	 	the	earth	kind	of	rush	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	at	night	,	and	then	rush	back	 aga 	 in 	 	?	i	mean	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	thing	going	on	,	and	we	hold	these	two	 model 	 s 	 	in	our	head	,	of	what	's	right	and	what	is	n't	right	,	and	we	do	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 field 	 s 	 	.
so	,	here	's	copernicus	'	view	of	what	the	solar	system	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 a 	 s 	 	a	plan	.
that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	what	you	should	have	on	your	piece	of	paper	.	right	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	nasa	's	view	.	they	're	 stunn 	 ing 	 ly 	 	similar	.
i	hope	you	notice	the	 co 	 incidence 	 	here	.
what	would	you	do	if	you	 k 	 new 	 	that	people	had	 th 	 is 	 	 mis 	 conception 	 	,	right	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,	of	 elli 	 pt 	 ical 	 	 orbit 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	our	 experience 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	children	?
what	sort	of	 dia 	 gram 	 	would	you	show	them	of	the	solar	system	,	to	show	that	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	like	that	?
you	'd	show	them	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	would	n't	you	?
it	's	a	plan	,	looking	down	from	above	.
but	,	no	,	look	what	i	found	in	the	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	you	show	people	,	right	?	these	are	from	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	,	from	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	,	 education 	 al 	 	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	--	and	 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	you	pick	up	is	like	that	.
and	the	reason	it	's	like	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	dead	 bor 	 ing 	 	to	have	a	load	of	 con 	 centric 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	that	's	much	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	to	look	at	 some 	 thing 	 	at	that	angle	,	is	n't	it	?	right	?	and	by	 do 	 ing 	 	it	at	that	angle	,	if	you	've	got	that	 mis 	 conception 	 	in	your	head	,	then	that	two	-	dimensional	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	a	three	-	dimensional	thing	will	be	 ellipse 	 s 	 	.
so	you	've	--	it	's	crap	,	is	n't	it	 re 	 ally 	 	?	 a 	 s 	 	we	say	.
so	,	these	mental	 model 	 s 	 	--	we	look	for	evidence	that	 reinforce 	 s 	 	our	 model 	 s 	 	.
we	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	with	 matter 	 s 	 	of	race	,	and	 politic 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	,	and	we	do	it	in	science	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	so	we	look	,	just	look	--	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	do	it	,	 constant 	 ly 	 	--	we	look	for	evidence	that	 reinforce 	 s 	 	our	 model 	 s 	 	,	and	some	 folk 	 s 	 	are	just	all	too	able	and	 will 	 ing 	 	to	provide	the	evidence	that	 reinforce 	 s 	 	the	 model 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 be 	 ing 	 	i	'm	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	i	'll	have	a	dig	at	the	europeans	.
these	are	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	what	i	would	say	is	bad	practice	in	science	 teach 	 ing 	 	 center 	 s 	 	.	these	 picture 	 s 	 	are	from	la	villette	in	france	and	the	welcome	wing	of	the	science	museum	in	london	.
and	,	if	you	look	at	the	,	kind	of	the	way	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 construct 	 ed 	 	,	there	's	a	lot	of	 media 	 tion 	 	by	glass	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	blue	,	and	kind	of	professional	--	in	that	way	that	,	you	know	,	 wood 	 y 	 	allen	 come 	 s 	 	up	from	under	the	 sheet 	 s 	 	in	that	scene	in	``	annie	hall	,	``	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	god	,	that	's	so	professional	.	``	and	that	you	do	n't	--	there	's	no	 pass 	 ion 	 	in	it	,	and	it	's	not	 hand 	 s 	 	on	,	right	,	and	,	you	know	,	pun	 intend 	 ed 	 	.	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 interpret 	 ation 	 	--	i	'll	use	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	 near 	 by 	 	--	is	san	francisco	exploratorium	,	where	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	--	the	 demonst 	 ration 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	,	are	made	out	of	 every 	 day 	 	 object 	 s 	 	that	children	can	understand	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	,	and	they	can	engage	with	,	and	experiment	with	.
and	i	know	that	if	the	 graduate 	 s 	 	at	mit	and	in	the	imperial	college	in	london	had	had	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	and	the	wire	and	the	bit	of	stuff	,	and	you	know	,	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	it	,	they	would	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 think 	 ing 	 	that	they	follow	circuit	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	and	ca	n't	do	it	.
so	good	 interpret 	 ation 	 	is	more	about	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 bod 	 ged 	 	and	 stuff 	 ed 	 	and	of	my	world	,	right	?
and	 thing 	 s 	 	that	--	where	there	is	n't	an	extra	 bar 	 rier 	 	of	a	piece	of	glass	or	 machine 	 d 	 	 titan 	 ium 	 	,	and	it	all	 look 	 s 	 	fantastic	,	ok	?
and	the	exploratorium	 do 	 es 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
and	it	's	amateur	,	but	amateur	in	the	best	sense	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	root	of	the	word	 be 	 ing 	 	of	love	and	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	children	are	not	empty	 vessel 	 s 	 	,	ok	?
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	``	monty	python	``	would	have	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bit	lord	 pri 	 vy 	 	seal	to	say	so	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	children	are	not	empty	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
they	come	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 the 	 ories 	 	,	and	 un 	 less 	 	you	work	with	 t 	 hose 	 	,	then	you	wo	n't	be	able	to	shift	them	,	right	?	and	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	n't	 shift 	 ed 	 	your	 idea 	 s 	 	of	how	the	world	and	 uni 	 verse 	 	 oper 	 ates 	 	,	either	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 appli 	 es 	 	,	 equal 	 ly 	 	,	to	 matter 	 s 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	new	technology	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	are	,	in	britain	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	a	digital	 s 	 witch 	 over 	 	of	the	whole	population	 in 	 to 	 	digital	technology	[	for	 tele 	 vision 	 	]	.
and	it	's	one	of	the	difficult	 thing 	 s 	 	is	that	when	people	have	 pre 	 conception 	 s 	 	of	how	it	all	 work 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	difficult	to	shift	 t 	 hose 	 	.
so	we	're	not	empty	 vessel 	 s 	 	;	the	mental	 model 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 a 	 s 	 	children	persist	 in 	 to 	 	 adult 	 hood 	 	.
poor	 teach 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	more	harm	than	good	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	country	and	in	britain	,	 magnet 	 ism 	 	is	 under 	 stood 	 	better	by	children	before	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	school	than	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	ok	?
same	for	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	two	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	so	it	's	--	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 hum 	 bling 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	,	you	know	,	if	you	're	a	teacher	,	and	you	look	before	and	after	,	that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 	.	they	do	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	 test 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	after	the	 teach 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	 col 	 lude 	 	.	we	design	 test 	 s 	 	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	britain	,	so	that	people	pass	them	.	right	?
