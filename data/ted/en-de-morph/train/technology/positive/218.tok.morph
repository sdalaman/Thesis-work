thank	you	.	ooh	,	i	'm	like	,	``	 p 	 hew 	 	,	 p 	 hew 	 	,	calm	down	.	get	back	 in 	 to 	 	my	body	now	.	``
 usual 	 ly 	 	when	i	play	out	,	the	first	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	is	people	 s 	 cream 	 	out	,	``	what	's	she	 do 	 ing 	 	?	!	``
i	'll	play	at	these	rock	 show 	 s 	 	,	be	on	stage	 stand 	 ing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	still	,	and	they	're	like	,	``	what	's	she	 do 	 ing 	 	?	!	what	's	she	 do 	 ing 	 	?	!	``
and	then	i	'll	kind	of	be	like	--	--	and	then	they	're	like	,	``	 who 	 a 	 	!	``
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	,	``	well	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	work	?	``
well	,	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	pitch	with	my	left	hand	.
see	,	the	 close 	 r 	 	i	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	antenna	,	the	 high 	 er 	 	the	note	 get 	 s 	 	--	--	and	you	can	get	it	 re 	 ally 	 	low	.
and	with	 th 	 is 	 	hand	i	'm	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	volume	,	so	the	further	away	my	right	hand	 get 	 s 	 	,	the	 loud 	 er 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	with	both	of	your	 hand 	 s 	 	you	're	 controll 	 ing 	 	pitch	and	volume	and	kind	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	the	illusion	that	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	 note 	 s 	 	,	when	 re 	 ally 	 	it	's	 continu 	 ously 	 	going	...
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	 start 	 le 	 	 my 	 self 	 	:	i	'll	forget	that	i	have	it	on	,	and	i	'll	lean	over	to	pick	up	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	then	it	 go 	 es 	 	like	--	--	``	oh	!	``
and	it	's	like	a	funny	sound	effect	that	 follow 	 s 	 	you	around	if	you	do	n't	turn	the	thing	off	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	'll	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	next	tune	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 total 	 ly 	 	lost	where	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	.
we	're	going	to	do	a	song	by	david	mash	 call 	 ed 	 	``	listen	:	the	 word 	 s 	 	are	gone	,	``	and	 may 	 be 	 	i	'll	have	 word 	 s 	 	come	back	 in 	 to 	 	me	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	if	i	can	relax	.
so	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	think	of	some	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	are	 common 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	;	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	.
and	...	well	,	i	guess	i	could	tell	you	a	little	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 there 	 min 	 	.
it	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	around	the	1920s	,	and	the	inventor	,	l√©on	 there 	 min 	 	--	he	 al 	 so 	 	was	a	 music 	 ian 	 	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	an	inventor	--	he	came	up	with	the	idea	for	making	the	 there 	 min 	 	,	i	think	,	when	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	some	 short 	 wave 	 	 radio 	 s 	 	.
and	there	'd	be	that	sound	in	the	signal	--	it	's	like	--	and	he	thought	,	``	oh	,	what	if	i	could	control	that	sound	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	instrument	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 pitch 	 es 	 	in	it	.	``
and	so	 some 	 how 	 	through	 develop 	 ing 	 	that	,	he	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	came	to	make	the	 there 	 min 	 	the	way	it	is	now	.
and	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	even	 kid 	 s 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	make	 re 	 ference 	 	to	a	 there 	 min 	 	by	going	,	``	whoo	-	hoo	-	hoo	-	hoo	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	'50s	it	was	used	in	the	sci	-	fi	 horr 	 or 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	,	that	sound	that	's	like	...
it	's	kind	of	a	funny	,	 goof 	 y 	 	sound	to	do	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	if	i	have	too	much	coffee	,	then	my	vibrato	 get 	 s 	 	out	of	hand	.
you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	sensitive	to	your	body	and	 it 	 s 	 	 function 	 s 	 	when	you	're	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
you	have	to	stay	so	still	if	you	want	to	have	the	most	control	.
it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	the	 balanc 	 ing 	 	act	 ear 	 lier 	 	on	--	what	michael	was	 do 	 ing 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	so	hard	to	keep	the	balance	with	what	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	with	and	stay	in	tune	,	and	at	the	same	time	you	do	n't	want	to	focus	so	much	on	 be 	 ing 	 	in	tune	all	the	time	;	you	want	to	be	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	music	.
and	then	 al 	 so 	 	,	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	stay	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	still	 be 	 cause 	 	little	 move 	 ments 	 	with	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	your	body	will	affect	the	pitch	,	or	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	if	you	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	a	low	note	--	--	and	 breath 	 ing 	 	will	make	it	...
if	i	pass	out	on	the	next	song	...
i	think	of	it	 al 	 most 	 	like	like	a	 y 	 oga 	 	instrument	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	you	so	aware	of	every	little	crazy	thing	your	body	is	 do 	 ing 	 	,	or	just	aware	of	what	you	do	n't	want	it	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	while	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	;	you	do	n't	want	to	have	any	sudden	 move 	 ments 	 	.
and	if	i	go	to	a	club	and	play	a	gig	,	people	are	like	,	``	here	,	have	some	 drink 	 s 	 	on	us	!	``
and	it	's	like	,	``	well	,	i	'm	about	to	go	on	soon	;	i	do	n't	want	to	be	like	--	--	you	know	?	``
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	reflect	the	mood	that	you	're	in	 al 	 so 	 	,	if	you	're	...
it	's	similar	to	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 vocal 	 ist 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	it	coming	out	of	your	throat	,	you	're	 controll 	 ing 	 	it	just	in	the	air	and	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	point	of	 re 	 ference 	 	;	you	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 re 	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	your	 ear 	 s 	 	and	 adjust 	 ing 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	.
you	just	have	to	 al 	 ways 	 	adjust	to	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	and	 real 	 ize 	 	you	'll	have	 bum 	 mer 	 	 note 	 s 	 	come	here	and	there	and	listen	to	it	,	adjust	it	,	and	just	move	on	,	or	else	you	'll	get	too	 ti 	 ed 	 	up	and	go	crazy	.	like	me	.
i	think	we	will	play	 an 	 other 	 	tune	now	.
i	'm	going	to	do	``	lush	life	.	``	it	's	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 tune 	 s 	 	to	play	.
