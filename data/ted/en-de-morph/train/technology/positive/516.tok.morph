the	allosphere	:	it	's	a	three	-	story	metal	sphere	in	an	echo	-	free	chamber	.
think	of	the	allosphere	 a 	 s 	 	a	large	,	 dynamic 	 ally 	 	 vary 	 ing 	 	digital	 micro 	 scope 	 	that	's	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	a	 super 	 computer 	 	.
20	 research 	 ers 	 	can	stand	on	a	bridge	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	sphere	,	and	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	data	.
imagine	if	a	team	of	 physicist 	 s 	 	could	stand	 in 	 side 	 	of	an	atom	and	watch	and	hear	 electron 	 s 	 	spin	.
imagine	if	a	group	of	 sculpt 	 ors 	 	could	be	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	lattice	of	 atom 	 s 	 	and	sculpt	with	 the 	 ir 	 	material	.
imagine	if	a	team	of	 surgeon 	 s 	 	could	fly	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	a	world	,	and	see	 tissue 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	and	hear	blood	density	 level 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	music	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	of	the	research	that	you	're	going	to	see	that	we	're	 under 	 taking 	 	at	the	allosphere	.
but	first	a	little	bit	about	 th 	 is 	 	group	of	 artist 	 s 	 	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	that	are	 work 	 ing 	 	together	.
i	'm	a	 compose 	 r 	 	,	orchestrally	-	trained	,	and	the	inventor	of	the	allosphere	.
with	my	visual	artist	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	we	map	complex	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 algorithm 	 s 	 	that	 un 	 fold 	 	in	time	and	space	,	 visual 	 ly 	 	and	 son 	 ically 	 	.
our	scientist	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	are	 find 	 ing 	 	new	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	the	information	.
and	our	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	are	making	one	of	the	largest	 dynamic 	 ally 	 	 vary 	 ing 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	in	the	world	for	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	data	exploration	.
i	'm	going	to	fly	you	 in 	 to 	 	five	research	 project 	 s 	 	in	the	allosphere	that	are	going	to	take	you	from	 bio 	 logical 	 	 macro 	 scopic 	 	data	all	the	way	down	to	electron	spin	.
 th 	 is 	 	first	project	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	allobrain	.
and	it	's	our	attempt	to	 quant 	 ify 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	by	 find 	 ing 	 	which	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	are	 inter 	 active 	 	while	 witness 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
you	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	through	the	cortex	of	my	 col 	 league 	 	's	brain	.
our	narrative	here	is	real	fmri	data	that	's	 ma 	 pped 	 	 visual 	 ly 	 	and	 son 	 ically 	 	.
the	brain	now	a	world	that	we	can	fly	through	and	interact	with	.
you	see	12	intelligent	computer	 agent 	 s 	 	,	the	little	 rect 	 angle 	 s 	 	that	are	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	the	brain	with	you	.
they	're	 min 	 ing 	 	blood	density	 level 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	 report 	 ing 	 	them	back	to	you	 son 	 ically 	 	.
 high 	 er 	 	density	 level 	 s 	 	mean	more	activity	in	that	point	of	the	brain	.
they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	these	 den 	 s 	 ities 	 	to	you	with	 high 	 er 	 	 pitch 	 es 	 	 ma 	 pped 	 	to	 high 	 er 	 	 den 	 s 	 ities 	 	.
we	're	now	going	to	move	from	real	 bio 	 logical 	 	data	to	 bio 	 generative 	 	 algorithm 	 s 	 	that	create	artificial	nature	in	our	next	 art 	 istic 	 	and	scientific	 install 	 ation 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 art 	 istic 	 	and	scientific	 install 	 ation 	 	,	 bio 	 generative 	 	 algorithm 	 s 	 	are	 help 	 ing 	 	us	to	understand	self	-	generation	and	growth	:	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 simul 	 ation 	 	in	the	 nano 	 scale 	 d 	 	 science 	 s 	 	.
for	 artist 	 s 	 	,	we	're	making	new	 world 	 s 	 	that	we	can	 un 	 cover 	 	and	explore	.
these	generative	 algorithm 	 s 	 	grow	over	time	,	and	they	interact	and	communicate	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 warm 	 	of	 insect 	 s 	 	.
our	 research 	 ers 	 	are	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	data	by	 inject 	 ing 	 	bacterial	code	,	which	are	computer	 program 	 s 	 	,	that	allow	these	 creature 	 s 	 	to	grow	over	time	.
we	're	going	to	move	now	from	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	and	the	 macro 	 scopic 	 	world	,	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	atomic	world	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	fly	 in 	 to 	 	a	lattice	of	 atom 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	real	afm	--	atomic	force	 micro 	 scope 	 	--	data	from	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	the	solid	state	 light 	 ing 	 	and	energy	center	.
they	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	a	new	bond	,	a	new	material	for	 trans 	 parent 	 	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	through	2,000	lattice	of	 atom 	 s 	 	--	oxygen	,	hydrogen	and	 z 	 inc 	 	.
you	view	the	bond	in	the	triangle	.
it	's	four	blue	 z 	 inc 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	 bond 	 ing 	 	with	one	white	hydrogen	atom	.
you	see	the	electron	flow	with	the	 stream 	 lines 	 	we	 a 	 s 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	have	generated	for	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 allow 	 ing 	 	them	to	find	the	 bond 	 ing 	 	 nod 	 es 	 	in	any	lattice	of	 atom 	 s 	 	.
we	think	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	structural	art	.
the	sound	that	you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	are	the	actual	 e 	 mission 	 	 spectrum 	 s 	 	of	these	 atom 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 ma 	 pped 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	audio	domain	,	so	they	're	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	you	.
oxygen	,	hydrogen	and	 z 	 inc 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	signature	.
we	're	going	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	move	even	further	down	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	from	 th 	 is 	 	lattice	of	 atom 	 s 	 	to	one	single	hydrogen	atom	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	our	physicist	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	that	have	 give 	 n 	 	us	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 calcul 	 ations 	 	of	the	n	-	dimensional	schr√∂dinger	 equ 	 ation 	 	in	time	.
what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	right	now	is	a	 super 	 position 	 	of	an	electron	in	the	lower	three	 orbital 	 s 	 	of	a	hydrogen	atom	.
you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	and	 see 	 ing 	 	the	electron	flow	with	the	lines	.
the	white	 dot 	 s 	 	are	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	wave	that	will	show	you	where	the	electron	is	in	any	 give 	 n 	 	point	of	time	and	space	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	three	-	orbital	 configu 	 ration 	 	.
in	a	minute	we	're	going	to	move	to	a	two	-	orbital	 configu 	 ration 	 	,	and	you	're	going	to	notice	a	 puls 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	're	going	to	hear	an	 undul 	 ation 	 	between	the	sound	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	light	 emit 	 ter 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	sound	 start 	 s 	 	to	 puls 	 e 	 	and	contract	,	our	 physicist 	 s 	 	can	tell	when	a	 photo 	 n 	 	is	going	to	be	 emit 	 ted 	 	.
they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	find	new	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	in	these	 calcul 	 ations 	 	.
and	they	're	 understand 	 ing 	 	more	about	 quant 	 um 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	move	even	further	down	,	and	go	to	one	single	electron	spin	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	be	the	final	project	that	i	show	you	.
our	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	the	center	for	 quant 	 um 	 	computation	and	spintronics	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 measur 	 ing 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 laser 	 s 	 	 de 	 cohere 	 nce 	 	in	a	single	electron	spin	.
we	've	taken	 th 	 is 	 	information	and	we	've	made	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	model	out	of	it	.
you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	and	 hear 	 ing 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	information	flow	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	next	step	in	 simul 	 ating 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	and	information	technology	.
so	these	brief	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	give	you	an	idea	of	the	kind	of	work	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	at	the	university	of	california	,	santa	barbara	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	together	,	 art 	 s 	 	,	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	age	of	math	,	science	and	art	.
we	hope	that	all	of	you	will	come	to	see	the	allosphere	.
inspire	us	to	think	of	new	ways	that	we	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	instrument	that	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	at	santa	barbara	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
