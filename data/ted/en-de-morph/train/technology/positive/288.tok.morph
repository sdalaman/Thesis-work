most	people	do	n't	know	that	when	i	went	to	high	school	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	--	i	 appli 	 ed 	 	for	university	at	a	time	when	i	was	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	i	was	going	to	be	an	artist	and	be	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	.
and	i	came	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	.	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	.
my	family	was	 wealth 	 y 	 	,	and	my	father	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	one	thing	,	and	that	was	to	give	us	all	 a 	 s 	 	much	education	 a 	 s 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	 announce 	 d 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	in	paris	.
and	he	was	a	clever	man	.	he	sort	of	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	that	's	ok	,	but	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	in	your	math	sats	.	``
in	fact	,	i	'd	got	an	800.	and	he	thought	i	did	 ver 	 y 	 	well	--	and	i	did	,	too	--	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	was	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	``	if	you	go	to	mit	,	``	to	which	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	early	 ad 	 mission 	 	,	``	i	will	pay	for	every	year	you	're	at	mit	,	in	graduate	or	 under 	 graduate 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	you	want	--	i	will	pay	for	an	equal	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	for	you	to	live	in	paris	.	``
and	i	thought	that	was	the	best	deal	in	town	,	so	i	 accept 	 ed 	 	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	if	i	was	good	in	art	,	and	i	was	good	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	i	'd	 stud 	 y 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	which	was	the	 blend 	 ing 	 	of	the	two	.
i	went	and	told	my	 head 	 master 	 	that	,	at	prep	school	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	i	was	going	to	go	 stud 	 y 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	art	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	put	together	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	 some 	 thing 	 	that	just	went	 complete 	 ly 	 	over	my	head	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	like	 gr 	 ey 	 	 suit 	 s 	 	,	and	i	like	pin	-	 strip 	 ed 	 	 suit 	 s 	 	,	but	i	do	n't	like	 gr 	 ey 	 	pin	-	 strip 	 ed 	 	 suit 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	thought	,	``	what	a	 tur 	 key 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	,	``	and	i	went	off	to	mit	.
i	 stud 	 ied 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	then	did	a	second	degree	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	and	then	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	n't	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
that	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	 mix 	 ing 	 	of	art	and	science	was	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	that	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	the	place	to	 br 	 ing 	 	both	,	and	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	a	 care 	 er 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
and	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	fill	out	jim	citrin	's	scale	,	i	'd	put	100	percent	on	the	side	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	where	you	 s 	 pend 	 	time	making	it	possible	for	 other 	 s 	 	to	be	creative	.
and	after	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	long	time	,	and	the	media	lab	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	 ba 	 ton 	 	on	,	i	thought	,	``	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	time	for	me	to	do	a	project	.
 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	be	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	take	advantage	of	all	of	these	privileges	that	one	had	.	``

did	n't	have	to	worry	about	 earn 	 ing 	 	money	.
did	n't	have	to	worry	about	what	people	thought	about	me	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	boy	,	let	's	 re 	 ally 	 	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 take 	 s 	 	advantage	of	all	these	 feature 	 s 	 	,	``	and	thought	that	if	we	could	address	education	,	by	 lever 	 aging 	 	the	children	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	the	world	the	access	of	the	 computer 	 s 	 	,	that	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	thing	we	should	do	.
never	 show 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	picture	before	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	be	 su 	 ed 	 	for	it	.
it	's	taken	at	three	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	 per 	 mission 	 	of	the	company	.
it	's	about	two	 week 	 s 	 	old	.	there	they	are	,	 folk 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	picture	,	you	'll	see	they	're	 stack 	 ed 	 	up	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 convey 	 or 	 	 belt 	 s 	 	that	go	around	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 convey 	 or 	 	 belt 	 s 	 	with	the	thing	going	by	,	but	then	you	'll	see	the	 one 	 s 	 	up	above	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	they	burn	 in 	 to 	 	flash	 memor 	 y 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	and	then	test	them	for	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	.
but	you	've	got	to	have	the	thing	moving	on	the	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	constant	.
so	they	go	around	in	 th 	 is 	 	loop	,	which	is	why	you	see	them	up	there	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	great	for	us	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	real	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	.	but	it	 go 	 es 	 	back	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	was	taken	in	1982	,	just	before	the	ibm	pc	was	even	 announce 	 d 	 	.

but	one	thing	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	these	 kid 	 s 	 	can	 absolute 	 ly 	 	jump	 in 	 to 	 	it	just	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	do	here	.
and	when	people	tell	me	,	``	who	's	going	to	teach	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	teach	the	 kid 	 s 	 	?	``
i	say	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	what	planet	do	you	come	from	?	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	there	's	not	a	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	i	do	n't	care	how	 tech 	 ie 	 	you	are	--	there	's	not	a	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	 the 	 ir 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	or	cell	phone	to	a	kid	to	help	them	debug	it	.	ok	?
we	all	need	help	,	even	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	seasoned	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	of	seymour	--	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	seymour	made	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 observ 	 ation 	 	in	1968	,	and	then	 bas 	 ically 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	it	in	1970	--	april	11	to	be	precise	--	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 teach 	 ing 	 	children	 think 	 ing 	 	.	``
what	he	 observ 	 ed 	 	was	that	 kid 	 s 	 	who	write	computer	 program 	 s 	 	understand	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	when	they	debug	the	 program 	 s 	 	,	they	come	the	 close 	 st 	 	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	in	some	sense	,	we	've	lost	that	.
 kid 	 s 	 	do	n't	program	 en 	 ough 	 	and	boy	,	if	there	's	 any 	 thing 	 	i	hope	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	back	,	it	's	 programm 	 ing 	 	to	 kid 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	using	 application 	 s 	 	is	ok	,	but	 programm 	 ing 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fundamental	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	with	three	 language 	 s 	 	in	it	:	squeak	,	logo	,	and	a	third	,	that	i	've	never	even	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
the	point	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	intensive	on	the	 programm 	 ing 	 	side	.
 th 	 is 	 	photograph	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	much	 lat 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	early	2000s	.	my	son	,	dimitri	--	who	's	here	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	dimitri	--	went	to	cambodia	,	set	up	 th 	 is 	 	school	that	we	had	built	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	the	school	 connect 	 ed 	 	it	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	these	 kid 	 s 	 	had	 the 	 ir 	 	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 spirit 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	plus	the	influence	of	joe	and	 other 	 s 	 	.	we	 start 	 ed 	 	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	village	in	cambodia	,	just	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
these	 kid 	 s 	 	are	real	 pro 	 s 	 	.	there	 we 	 re 	 	just	7,000	 machine 	 s 	 	out	there	 be 	 ing 	 	tested	by	 kid 	 s 	 	.	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 non 	 profit 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fundamental	.
 every 	 body 	 	 advise 	 d 	 	me	not	to	be	a	 non 	 profit 	 	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	wrong	.
and	the	reason	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 non 	 profit 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	twofold	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	but	the	two	that	merit	the	little	bit	of	time	is	:	one	,	the	 clar 	 ity 	 	of	purpose	is	there	.	the	moral	purpose	is	clear	.
i	can	see	any	head	of	state	,	any	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	i	want	,	at	any	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	not	selling	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	ok	?	i	have	no	 share 	 holder 	 s 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	we	sell	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
the	 clar 	 ity 	 	of	purpose	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	critical	.	and	the	second	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	--	you	can	get	the	best	people	in	the	world	.
if	you	look	at	our	professional	 service 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	search	 firm 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	legal	 service 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	,	they	're	all	pro	bono	.	and	it	's	not	to	 s 	 ave 	 	money	.
we	've	got	money	in	the	bank	.	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	get	the	best	people	.
you	get	the	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	mission	,	and	they	're	the	best	people	.
we	could	n't	afford	to	hire	a	cfo	.	we	put	out	a	job	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	for	a	cfo	at	zero	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	,	and	we	had	a	queue	of	people	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	team	up	with	people	.	the	u.n.	's	not	going	to	be	our	partner	if	we	're	profit	making	.	so	 announc 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	kofi	annan	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	the	u.n.	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	reach	all	the	 count 	 ries 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	machine	we	 we 	 re 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	before	i	met	yves	behar	.
and	while	 th 	 is 	 	machine	in	some	sense	is	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	,	in	retrospect	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	purpose	.
that	pencil	-	yellow	crank	was	 remember 	 ed 	 	by	 every 	 body 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 remember 	 ed 	 	the	pencil	-	yellow	crank	.	it	's	different	.
it	was	 get 	 ting 	 	 it 	 s 	 	power	in	a	different	way	.	it	's	kind	of	 child 	 like 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	the	direction	we	went	 be 	 cause 	 	the	crank	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	stupid	to	have	it	on	board	,	by	the	way	.
in	spite	of	what	some	people	in	the	press	do	n't	get	it	,	did	n't	understand	it	,	we	did	n't	take	it	off	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	want	to	do	--	 hav 	 ing 	 	it	on	the	 lap 	 top 	 	 it 	 self 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	what	you	want	.
you	want	a	 separat 	 e 	 	thing	,	like	the	ac	adaptor	.
i	did	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	one	with	me	,	but	they	 re 	 ally 	 	work	much	better	off	-	board	.
and	then	,	i	could	tell	you	 lot 	 s 	 	about	the	 lap 	 top 	 	,	but	i	 decide 	 d 	 	on	just	four	 thing 	 s 	 	.
just	keep	in	mind	--	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	other	people	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	gee	,	you	've	got	a	real	computer	.	``
that	computer	is	 un 	 like 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	you	've	had	,	and	 do 	 es 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	there	are	four	of	them	--	that	you	do	n't	come	close	to	.	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	be	low	power	,	and	i	hope	that	's	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	more	by	the	industry	.
that	the	reason	that	you	want	to	be	 be 	 low 	 	two	 watt 	 s 	 	is	that	's	 rough 	 ly 	 	what	you	can	generate	with	your	upper	body	.
dual	-	mode	 dis 	 play 	 	--	that	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	's	fantastic	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	using	it	at	lunch	 to 	 day 	 	in	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	and	the	more	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	the	better	.
and	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	.	the	mesh	network	,	it	'll	 be 	 come 	 	 common 	 place 	 	.
and	of	course	,	``	 rug 	 ged 	 	``	 go 	 es 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	reason	i	think	design	 matter 	 s 	 	is	n't	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	to	art	school	.
and	by	the	way	,	when	i	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	mit	,	i	thought	the	worst	and	silliest	thing	to	do	would	be	to	go	to	paris	for	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	did	n't	do	that	.	but	design	 matter 	 s 	 	for	a	number	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	that	it	is	the	best	way	to	make	an	 in 	 expensive 	 	product	.
most	people	make	 in 	 expensive 	 	 product 	 s 	 	by	taking	cheap	design	,	cheap	labor	,	cheap	 component 	 s 	 	,	and	making	a	cheap	 lap 	 top 	 	.
and	,	in	english	,	the	word	``	cheap	``	 ha 	 s 	 	a	double	meaning	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	appropriate	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	cheap	,	in	the	 pe 	 jo 	 rative 	 	sense	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 	.
but	if	you	take	a	different	approach	,	and	you	think	of	 ver 	 y 	 	large	-	scale	 integ 	 ration 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	--	so	you	're	 pour 	 ing 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	one	end	,	ipods	are	 spew 	 ing 	 	out	the	other	--	and	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	design	,	that	's	what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
and	i	can	race	through	these	and	 s 	 ave 	 	a	lot	of	time	 be 	 cause 	 	yves	and	i	 obvious 	 ly 	 	did	n't	 compar 	 e 	 	 note 	 s 	 	.
these	are	his	 slide 	 s 	 	,	and	so	i	do	n't	have	to	talk	about	them	.
but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	,	to	us	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
it	was	n't	just	to	kind	of	make	it	cute	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 body 	 	--	you	know	,	good	design	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
yves	 show 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	power	-	generating	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
the	mesh	network	,	the	reason	i	--	and	i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	it	in	great	detail	--	but	when	we	deliver	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	to	 kid 	 s 	 	in	the	 remote 	 st 	 	and	 poor 	 est 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	they	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	.	there	's	not	just	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	we	have	to	drop	in	satellite	 dish 	 es 	 	.	we	put	in	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	lot	of	stuff	that	 go 	 es 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	these	.	these	can	talk	to	each	other	.
if	you	're	in	a	desert	,	they	can	talk	to	each	other	about	two	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
if	you	're	in	the	jungle	,	it	's	about	500	 meter 	 s 	 	.	so	if	a	kid	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	home	,	or	 walk 	 s 	 	a	few	 mile 	 s 	 	,	they	're	going	to	be	off	the	grid	,	so	to	speak	.
they	're	not	going	to	be	near	 an 	 other 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	,	so	you	have	to	nail	these	onto	a	tree	,	and	sort	of	,	get	it	.
you	do	n't	call	verizon	or	 s 	 print 	 	.	you	build	your	own	network	.
and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	the	user	 inter 	 face 	 	.
we	are	 launch 	 ing 	 	with	18	 key 	 board 	 s 	 	.	english	is	by	far	the	 minor 	 ity 	 	.
latin	is	 relat 	 ively 	 	rare	,	too	.	you	just	look	at	some	of	the	 language 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	suspect	some	of	you	had	n't	even	heard	of	them	before	.
is	there	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	room	,	one	person	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	work	with	olpc	,	is	there	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	room	that	can	tell	me	what	language	the	 key 	 board 	 	is	that	's	on	the	screen	?	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	hand	--	so	you	get	it	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	you	're	right	.	he	's	right	.	it	's	amharic	,	it	's	ethiopian	.	in	ethiopia	,	there	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	a	 key 	 board 	 	.
there	is	no	 key 	 board 	 	standard	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	market	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	when	you	're	a	 non 	 profit 	 	,	you	look	at	children	 a 	 s 	 	a	mission	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	market	.
so	we	went	to	ethiopia	,	and	we	 help 	 ed 	 	them	make	a	 key 	 board 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	the	standard	ethiopian	 key 	 board 	 	.
so	what	i	want	to	end	with	is	sort	of	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	roll	it	out	.
and	we	 change 	 d 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	.	i	 decide 	 d 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	--	it	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	thing	to	decide	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	it	's	not	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	now	--	is	to	go	to	six	 count 	 ries 	 	.
big	 count 	 ries 	 	,	one	of	them	is	not	so	big	,	but	it	's	rich	.
here	's	the	six	.	we	went	to	the	six	,	and	in	each	case	the	head	of	state	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	do	it	,	he	'd	do	a	million	.
in	the	case	of	qaddafi	,	he	'd	do	1.2	million	,	and	that	they	would	launch	it	.
we	thought	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	right	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	get	it	out	,	and	then	the	little	 count 	 ries 	 	could	sort	of	 piggy 	 back 	 	on	these	big	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	so	i	went	to	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	six	 time 	 s 	 	,	met	with	the	head	of	state	 prob 	 ably 	 	two	or	three	 time 	 s 	 	.
in	each	case	,	got	the	 mini 	 sters 	 	,	went	through	a	lot	of	the	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	period	in	my	life	where	i	was	 travel 	 ing 	 	330	 day 	 s 	 	per	year	.
not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	'd	 en 	 vy 	 	or	want	to	do	.
in	the	case	of	libya	,	it	was	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	qaddafi	in	his	tent	.
the	camel	 smell 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
and	it	was	45	 degree 	 s 	 	c.	i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	what	you	'd	call	a	cool	experience	.	and	 form 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	i	say	 form 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 re 	 ally 	 	came	through	 th 	 is 	 	summer	--	there	was	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 get 	 ting 	 	a	head	of	state	to	have	a	photo	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	make	a	press	 re 	 lease 	 	.
so	we	went	to	 small 	 er 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.	uruguay	,	bless	 the 	 ir 	 	 heart 	 s 	 	.
small	country	,	not	so	rich	.	 p 	 resident 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	he	'd	do	it	,	and	guess	what	?
he	did	do	it	.	the	tender	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	it	that	related	to	us	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	specific	about	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	-	 read 	 able 	 	,	mesh	-	network	,	low	-	power	,	but	just	a	 van 	 illa 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	proposal	.
and	guess	what	?	we	won	it	 hand 	 s 	 	down	.
when	it	was	 announce 	 d 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	do	every	child	in	uruguay	,	the	first	100,000	,	boom	,	went	to	olpc	.
the	next	day	--	the	next	day	,	not	even	24	 hour 	 s 	 	had	 pass 	 ed 	 	--	in	peru	,	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	peru	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	'll	do	250.	``	and	boom	,	a	little	 domin 	 o 	 	effect	.
the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	rwanda	 steppe 	 d 	 	in	and	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	do	it	.
the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	ethiopia	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	do	it	.
and	boom	,	boom	,	boom	.	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	mongolia	.
and	so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	start	to	happen	with	these	 count 	 ries 	 	--	still	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
add	up	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	it	did	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	get	to	thing	,	so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	start	a	program	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.	``	so	,	end	of	august	,	early	september	,	we	decide	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	we	 announce 	 d 	 	it	near	the	middle	,	end	--	just	when	the	clinton	 initi 	 ative 	 	was	taking	place	.
we	thought	that	was	a	good	time	to	announce	it	.
 launch 	 ed 	 	it	on	the	12	of	november	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	it	would	be	just	for	a	short	period	 un 	 til 	 	the	26.	we	've	 extend 	 ed 	 	it	 un 	 til 	 	the	31	.
and	the	``	give	one	,	get	one	``	program	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	got	a	lot	of	people	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
the	first	day	it	was	just	wild	.	and	then	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	let	's	get	people	to	give	 man 	 y 	 	.	not	just	one	,	and	get	one	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	give	100	,	give	1,000	.	``	and	that	's	where	you	come	in	.
and	that	's	where	i	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	i	do	n't	want	you	all	to	go	out	and	buy	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	worth	of	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	do	it	,	but	that	's	not	going	to	help	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
if	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 go 	 es 	 	out	 to 	 night 	 	and	 order 	 s 	 	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	for	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	300	people	in	the	room	 do 	 ing 	 	it	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	great	.
i	want	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	it	's	not	to	go	out	and	buy	100	or	1,000	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	do	that	,	and	10,000	would	be	even	better	.
tell	people	about	it	!	it	's	got	to	 be 	 come 	 	viral	,	ok	?
use	your	 mail 	 ing 	 	 list 	 s 	 	.	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	have	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 mail 	 ing 	 	 list 	 s 	 	.
get	your	 friend 	 s 	 	to	give	one	,	get	one	.
and	if	each	one	of	you	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	it	to	300	or	400	people	,	that	would	be	fantastic	.
i	wo	n't	 d 	 well 	 	on	the	 pric 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
just	to	say	that	when	you	do	the	``	give	one	,	get	one	,	``	a	lot	of	press	is	a	bit	about	,	``	they	did	n't	make	it	,	it	's	188	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	100.	``
it	will	be	100	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	.	it	will	go	 be 	 low 	 	100	.
we	've	 pledg 	 ed 	 	not	to	add	 feature 	 s 	 	,	but	to	 br 	 ing 	 	that	price	down	.
but	it	was	the	 count 	 ries 	 	that	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	go	up	,	and	we	let	them	push	it	up	for	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.	so	what	you	can	do	--	i	've	just	 s 	 aid 	 	it	.	do	n't	just	give	one	,	get	one	.
i	just	want	to	end	with	one	last	one	.	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	not	even	24	-	 hour 	 s 	 	old	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	24	-	 hour 	 s 	 	.
the	first	 kid 	 s 	 	got	 the 	 ir 	 	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	they	got	them	by	ship	,	and	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	now	about	7,000	,	8,000	at	a	time	went	out	 th 	 is 	 	week	.
they	went	to	uruguay	,	peru	,	mexico	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 low 	 	coming	,	and	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	making	about	5,000	a	week	,	but	we	hope	,	we	hope	,	 some 	 time 	 	in	next	year	,	 may 	 be 	 	by	the	middle	of	the	year	,	to	hit	a	million	a	month	.	now	put	that	number	,	and	a	million	is	n't	so	much	.	it	's	not	a	big	number	.
we	're	selling	a	billion	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
but	a	million	a	month	in	 lap 	 top 	 	-	land	is	a	big	number	.
and	the	world	production	 to 	 day 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	,	making	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	,	is	five	million	a	month	.	so	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	that	 some 	 time 	 	next	year	,	we	're	going	to	make	20	percent	of	the	world	production	.
and	if	we	do	that	,	there	are	going	to	be	a	lot	of	 luck 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	out	there	.
and	we	hope	if	you	have	eg	two	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	or	 when 	 ever 	 	you	have	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	wo	n't	have	bad	breath	,	and	i	will	be	 invit 	 ed 	 	back	,	and	will	have	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	by	then	,	 may 	 be 	 	100	million	out	there	to	children	.
thank	you	.
