 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	 sketch 	 ing 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	,	among	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	an	 electric 	 al 	 	engineer	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	 s 	 pend 	 	a	good	amount	of	time	 design 	 ing 	 	and	building	new	 piece 	 s 	 	of	technology	,	and	more	 specific 	 ally 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	and	building	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	've	found	is	that	the	process	of	 design 	 ing 	 	and	building	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	is	 problem 	 atic 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	ways	.
so	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 low 	 	process	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	expensive	,	and	the	 out 	 come 	 	of	that	process	,	 name 	 ly 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	circuit	 board 	 s 	 	,	are	 limit 	 ed 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	.
so	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	small	,	 general 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	square	and	flat	and	hard	,	and	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	most	of	them	just	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	,	and	so	my	team	and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	ways	to	 re 	 ally 	 	change	and	mix	up	the	process	and	the	 out 	 come 	 	of	 design 	 ing 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
and	so	what	if	you	could	design	and	build	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?	so	what	if	you	could	do	it	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 ly 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 fluid 	 ly 	 	and	 express 	 ively 	 	and	even	 improvisation 	 ally 	 	?
would	n't	that	be	so	cool	,	and	that	would	n't	that	open	up	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	new	 possibil 	 ities 	 	?
i	'm	going	to	share	with	you	two	 project 	 s 	 	that	are	 investigation 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	these	lines	,	and	we	'll	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 magnet 	 ic 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	and	 ferr 	 ous 	 	paper	.
a	 conduct 	 ive 	 	pen	from	the	lewis	lab	at	uiuc	.
 stick 	 er 	 	 template 	 s 	 	.
speed	x	4	.
making	a	 s 	 witch 	 	.
music	:	dj	shadow	.
 add 	 ing 	 	some	 intellig 	 ence 	 	with	a	 micro 	 controll 	 er 	 	.
 sketch 	 ing 	 	an	 inter 	 face 	 	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	,	huh	?	we	think	so	.
so	now	that	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	these	 tool 	 s 	 	and	found	these	 material 	 s 	 	that	let	us	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	do	with	paper	,	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	do	with	a	piece	of	paper	and	a	pen	we	can	now	do	with	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
so	the	next	project	that	i	want	to	show	you	is	kind	of	a	 deep 	 er 	 	exploration	of	that	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	'll	kind	of	let	it	speak	for	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	the	next	step	for	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	now	to	find	a	way	to	let	all	of	you	build	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	so	the	way	that	we	're	 approach 	 ing 	 	that	is	by	 teach 	 ing 	 	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	to	people	where	we	explain	how	they	can	use	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 tool 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	 tool 	 s 	 	and	the	 material 	 s 	 	and	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	real	world	in	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	ways	.
and	so	 some 	 time 	 	soon	,	you	'll	be	able	to	play	and	build	and	sketch	with	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	new	way	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
