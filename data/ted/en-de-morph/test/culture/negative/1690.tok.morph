now	,	 extinct 	 ion 	 	is	a	different	kind	of	death	.
it	's	 big 	 ger 	 	.
we	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 un 	 til 	 	1914	,	when	the	last	passenger	pigeon	,	a	female	named	martha	,	 di 	 ed 	 	at	the	cincinnati	zoo	.
 th 	 is 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	the	most	abundant	bird	in	the	world	that	'd	 be 	 en 	 	in	north	america	for	six	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	it	was	n't	here	at	all	.
 flock 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	a	mile	wide	and	400	 mile 	 s 	 	long	used	to	 dark 	 en 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
aldo	leopold	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	storm	,	a	 feather 	 ed 	 	tempest	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	it	was	a	 key 	 stone 	 	species	that	 enrich 	 ed 	 	the	entire	eastern	deciduous	forest	,	from	the	mississippi	to	the	atlantic	,	from	canada	down	to	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	.
but	it	went	from	five	billion	 bird 	 s 	 	to	zero	in	just	a	couple	 decade 	 s 	 	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	commercial	 hunt 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
these	 bird 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 hunt 	 ed 	 	for	meat	that	was	 s 	 old 	 	by	the	ton	,	and	it	was	easy	to	do	 be 	 cause 	 	when	 t 	 hose 	 	big	 flock 	 s 	 	came	down	to	the	ground	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	dense	that	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 hunter 	 s 	 	and	netters	could	show	up	and	 s 	 laughter 	 	them	by	the	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	.
it	was	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	source	of	protein	in	america	.
by	the	end	of	the	century	,	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	left	but	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 skin 	 s 	 	in	museum	specimen	drawers	.
there	's	an	 up 	 side 	 	to	the	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	made	people	 real 	 ize 	 	that	the	same	thing	was	about	to	happen	to	the	american	 bi 	 son 	 	,	and	so	these	 bird 	 s 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	the	buffalos	.
but	a	lot	of	other	 animal 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
the	carolina	parakeet	was	a	 par 	 rot 	 	that	lit	up	 back 	 yard 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
it	was	 hunt 	 ed 	 	to	death	for	 it 	 s 	 	 feather 	 s 	 	.
there	was	a	bird	that	people	 like 	 d 	 	on	the	east	coast	 call 	 ed 	 	the	heath	hen	.
it	was	 love 	 d 	 	.	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	protect	it	.	it	 di 	 ed 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
a	local	 news 	 paper 	 	 spell 	 ed 	 	out	,	``	there	is	no	 surviv 	 or 	 	,	there	is	no	future	,	there	is	no	life	to	be	 re 	 create 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	form	ever	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
there	's	a	sense	of	deep	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	with	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 bird 	 s 	 	that	people	 love 	 d 	 	.
it	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 mammal 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 key 	 stone 	 	species	is	a	famous	animal	 call 	 ed 	 	the	european	aurochs	.
there	was	sort	of	a	movie	made	about	it	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	aurochs	was	like	the	 bi 	 son 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	animal	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	the	forest	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	 grass 	 land 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	europe	and	asian	continent	,	from	spain	to	korea	.

the	 extinct 	 ions 	 	still	go	on	.
there	's	an	ibex	in	spain	 call 	 ed 	 	the	bucardo	.
it	went	extinct	in	2000	.
there	was	a	 marvel 	 ous 	 	animal	,	a	marsupial	wolf	 call 	 ed 	 	the	thylacine	in	tasmania	,	south	of	australia	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	tasmanian	tiger	.
it	was	 hunt 	 ed 	 	 un 	 til 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	just	a	few	left	to	die	in	 zoo 	 s 	 	.
a	little	bit	of	film	was	shot	.
sorrow	,	anger	,	 mourn 	 ing 	 	.
do	n't	mourn	.	organize	.
what	if	you	could	find	out	that	,	using	the	dna	in	museum	 specimen 	 s 	 	,	 fossil 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	up	to	200,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	could	be	used	to	 br 	 ing 	 	species	back	,	what	would	you	do	?	where	would	you	start	?
well	,	you	'd	start	by	 find 	 ing 	 	out	if	the	 bio 	 tech 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	there	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	my	wife	,	ryan	phelan	,	who	ran	a	 bio 	 tech 	 	business	 call 	 ed 	 	dna	direct	,	and	through	her	,	one	of	her	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	george	church	,	one	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	genetic	 engineer 	 s 	 	who	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 al 	 so 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	passenger	 pigeon 	 s 	 	and	a	lot	of	confidence	that	 method 	 o 	 logies 	 	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	the	 de 	 ed 	 	.
so	he	and	ryan	 organize 	 d 	 	and	 host 	 ed 	 	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	at	the	wyss	institute	in	harvard	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	together	 special 	 ists 	 	on	passenger	 pigeon 	 s 	 	,	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 ornitho 	 logists 	 	,	bioethicists	,	and	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	passenger	pigeon	dna	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 sequence 	 d 	 	by	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biologist	named	beth	shapiro	.
all	she	 need 	 ed 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 specimen 	 s 	 	at	the	smithsonian	was	a	little	bit	of	 to 	 e 	 	pad	tissue	,	 be 	 cause 	 	down	in	there	is	what	is	 call 	 ed 	 	ancient	dna	.
it	's	dna	which	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	 fragment 	 ed 	 	,	but	with	good	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	now	,	you	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	 re 	 assemble 	 	the	whole	genome	.
then	the	question	is	,	can	you	 re 	 assemble 	 	,	with	that	genome	,	the	whole	bird	?
george	church	 think 	 s 	 	you	can	.
so	in	his	book	,	``	regenesis	,	``	which	i	recommend	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	chapter	on	the	science	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	back	extinct	species	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	machine	 call 	 ed 	 	the	multiplex	 autom 	 ated 	 	genome	 engineer 	 ing 	 	machine	.
it	's	kind	of	like	an	evolution	machine	.
you	try	 combination 	 s 	 	of	 gene 	 s 	 	that	you	write	at	the	cell	level	and	then	in	 organ 	 s 	 	on	a	chip	,	and	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	win	,	that	you	can	then	put	 in 	 to 	 	a	living	organism	.	it	'll	work	.
the	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	one	of	george	's	famous	unreadable	 slide 	 s 	 	,	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	 point 	 s 	 	out	that	there	's	a	level	of	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	here	right	down	to	the	individual	base	pair	.
the	passenger	pigeon	 ha 	 s 	 	1.3	billion	base	 pair 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	genome	.
so	what	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	is	the	 cap 	 ability 	 	now	of	 re 	 placing 	 	one	gene	with	 an 	 other 	 	 vari 	 ation 	 	of	that	gene	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	an	 alle 	 le 	 	.
well	that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	normal	 hybrid 	 ization 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	form	of	synthetic	 hybrid 	 ization 	 	of	the	genome	of	an	extinct	species	with	the	genome	of	 it 	 s 	 	 close 	 st 	 	living	 relat 	 ive 	 	.
now	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	,	george	 point 	 s 	 	out	that	his	technology	,	the	technology	of	synthetic	biology	,	is	 current 	 ly 	 	 accele 	 rating 	 	at	four	 time 	 s 	 	the	rate	of	moore	's	law	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	since	2005	,	and	it	's	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 continu 	 e 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	the	 close 	 st 	 	living	 relat 	 ive 	 	of	the	passenger	pigeon	is	the	band	-	tailed	pigeon	.	they	're	abundant	.	there	's	some	around	here	.
 genetic 	 ally 	 	,	the	band	-	tailed	pigeon	 al 	 ready 	 	is	 most 	 ly 	 	living	passenger	pigeon	.
there	's	just	some	bits	that	are	band	-	tailed	pigeon	.
if	you	replace	 t 	 hose 	 	bits	with	passenger	pigeon	bits	,	you	've	got	the	extinct	bird	back	,	cooing	at	you	.
now	,	there	's	work	to	do	.
you	have	to	figure	out	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 gene 	 s 	 	matter	.
so	there	's	 gene 	 s 	 	for	the	short	tail	in	the	band	-	tailed	pigeon	,	 gene 	 s 	 	for	the	long	tail	in	the	passenger	pigeon	,	and	so	on	with	the	red	eye	,	peach	-	 color 	 ed 	 	breast	,	 flock 	 ing 	 	,	and	so	on	.
add	them	all	up	and	the	result	wo	n't	be	perfect	.
but	it	should	be	be	perfect	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	nature	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	perfect	either	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	in	boston	led	to	three	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	off	,	ryan	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	create	a	 non 	 profit 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 rev 	 ive 	 	and	 re 	 store 	 	that	would	push	de	-	 extinct 	 ion 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	and	try	to	have	it	go	in	a	 respons 	 ible 	 	way	,	and	we	would	push	 a 	 head 	 	with	the	passenger	pigeon	.
 an 	 other 	 	direct	result	was	a	young	grad	student	named	ben	novak	,	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	passenger	 pigeon 	 s 	 	since	he	was	14	and	had	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	work	with	ancient	dna	,	 him 	 self 	 	 sequence 	 d 	 	the	passenger	pigeon	,	using	money	from	his	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	.
we	 hire 	 d 	 	him	full	-	time	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	i	took	of	him	last	year	at	the	smithsonian	,	he	's	looking	down	at	martha	,	the	last	passenger	pigeon	 al 	 ive 	 	.
so	if	he	's	 success 	 ful 	 	,	she	wo	n't	be	the	last	.
the	third	result	of	the	boston	 meet 	 ing 	 	was	the	 real 	 ization 	 	that	there	are	 scientist 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 vari 	 ous 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	de	-	 extinct 	 ion 	 	,	but	they	'd	never	met	each	other	.
and	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	got	 interest 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 theor 	 y 	 	that	the	last	century	,	 discover 	 y 	 	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	,	 discover 	 y 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	making	 thing 	 s 	 	.
de	-	 extinct 	 ion 	 	 fall 	 s 	 	in	that	 categor 	 y 	 	.
so	they	 host 	 ed 	 	and	funded	 th 	 is 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.	and	35	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	and	 mole 	 cular 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	to	see	if	they	had	work	to	do	together	.
some	of	these	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	radical	.
there	's	three	of	them	who	are	not	just	re	-	creating	ancient	species	,	they	're	 re 	 creating 	 	extinct	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	siberia	,	in	the	netherlands	,	and	in	hawaii	.
henri	,	from	the	netherlands	,	with	a	dutch	last	name	i	wo	n't	try	to	pronounce	,	is	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	aurochs	.
the	aurochs	is	the	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	all	domestic	cattle	,	and	so	 bas 	 ically 	 	 it 	 s 	 	genome	is	 al 	 ive 	 	,	it	's	just	 un 	 even 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	.
so	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	with	seven	 breed 	 s 	 	of	primitive	,	 hard 	 y 	 	-	looking	cattle	like	that	maremmana	primitivo	on	the	top	there	to	 re 	 build 	 	,	over	time	,	with	 select 	 ive 	 	back	-	 breed 	 ing 	 	,	the	aurochs	.
now	,	re	-	wilding	is	moving	 fast 	 er 	 	in	korea	than	it	is	in	america	,	and	so	the	plan	is	,	with	these	re	-	wilded	 area 	 s 	 	all	over	europe	,	they	will	 introduc 	 e 	 	the	aurochs	to	do	 it 	 s 	 	old	job	,	 it 	 s 	 	old	 eco 	 logical 	 	role	,	of	 clear 	 ing 	 	the	 some 	 what 	 	 bar 	 ren 	 	,	closed	-	 can 	 opy 	 	forest	so	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	these	biodiverse	 meadow 	 s 	 	in	it	.
 an 	 other 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	story	came	from	alberto	fernández	-	 aria 	 s 	 	.
alberto	 work 	 ed 	 	with	the	bucardo	in	spain	.
the	last	bucardo	was	a	female	named	celia	who	was	still	 al 	 ive 	 	,	but	then	they	 capture 	 d 	 	her	,	they	got	a	little	bit	of	tissue	from	her	ear	,	they	cryopreserved	it	in	liquid	nitrogen	,	released	her	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	wild	,	but	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	she	was	found	dead	under	a	 fall 	 en 	 	tree	.
they	took	the	dna	from	that	ear	,	they	 plant 	 ed 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 clon 	 ed 	 	egg	in	a	goat	,	the	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	came	to	term	,	and	a	live	baby	bucardo	was	born	.
it	was	the	first	de	-	 extinct 	 ion 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	was	short	-	lived	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 inter 	 species 	 	 clone 	 s 	 	have	 re 	 spi 	 ration 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	had	a	 mal 	 form 	 ed 	 	lung	and	 di 	 ed 	 	after	10	 minute 	 s 	 	,	but	alberto	was	confident	that	 clon 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	 a 	 long 	 	well	since	then	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	will	move	 a 	 head 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	there	will	be	a	population	of	bucardos	back	in	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	spain	.
 cryo 	 p 	 reservation 	 	pioneer	of	great	depth	is	oliver	ryder	.
at	the	san	diego	zoo	,	his	 froze 	 n 	 	zoo	 ha 	 s 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	the	 tissue 	 s 	 	from	over	1,000	species	over	the	last	35	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	,	when	it	's	 froze 	 n 	 	that	deep	,	minus	196	 degree 	 s 	 	celsius	,	the	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 in 	 tact 	 	and	the	dna	is	 in 	 tact 	 	.
they	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 vi 	 able 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	so	 some 	 one 	 	like	bob	lanza	at	 advance 	 d 	 	cell	technology	took	some	of	that	tissue	from	an	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	animal	 call 	 ed 	 	the	javan	banteng	,	put	it	in	a	cow	,	the	cow	went	to	term	,	and	what	was	born	was	a	live	,	 health 	 y 	 	baby	javan	banteng	,	who	 thriv 	 ed 	 	and	is	still	 al 	 ive 	 	.
the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	for	bob	lanza	is	the	ability	now	to	take	any	kind	of	cell	with	induced	 pluri 	 potent 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	germ	 cell 	 s 	 	,	like	 s 	 perm 	 	and	 egg 	 s 	 	.
so	now	we	go	to	 mi 	 ke 	 	mcgrew	who	is	a	scientist	at	roslin	institute	in	scotland	,	and	 mi 	 ke 	 	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 miracle 	 s 	 	with	 bird 	 s 	 	.
so	he	'll	take	,	say	,	falcon	skin	 cell 	 s 	 	,	fibroblast	,	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	induced	 pluri 	 potent 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
since	it	's	so	 pluri 	 potent 	 	,	it	can	 be 	 come 	 	germ	plasm	.
he	then	 ha 	 s 	 	a	way	to	put	the	germ	plasm	 in 	 to 	 	the	embryo	of	a	chicken	egg	so	that	that	chicken	will	have	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	 gon 	 ad 	 s 	 	of	a	falcon	.
you	get	a	male	and	a	female	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	and	out	of	them	 come 	 s 	 	 falcon 	 s 	 	.
real	 falcon 	 s 	 	out	of	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	doctored	 chicken 	 s 	 	.
ben	novak	was	the	 young 	 est 	 	scientist	at	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
he	 show 	 ed 	 	how	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	put	together	.
the	sequence	of	 event 	 s 	 	:	he	'll	put	together	the	 genome 	 s 	 	of	the	band	-	tailed	pigeon	and	the	passenger	pigeon	,	he	'll	take	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	of	george	church	and	get	passenger	pigeon	dna	,	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	of	robert	lanza	and	michael	mcgrew	,	get	that	dna	 in 	 to 	 	chicken	 gon 	 ad 	 s 	 	,	and	out	of	the	chicken	 gon 	 ad 	 s 	 	get	passenger	pigeon	 egg 	 s 	 	,	squabs	,	and	now	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	a	population	of	passenger	 pigeon 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	raise	the	question	of	,	they	're	not	going	to	have	passenger	pigeon	 parent 	 s 	 	to	teach	them	how	to	be	a	passenger	pigeon	.
so	what	do	you	do	about	that	?
well	 bird 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	-	wired	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	so	most	of	that	is	 al 	 ready 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	,	but	to	supplement	it	,	part	of	ben	's	idea	is	to	use	 hom 	 ing 	 	 pigeon 	 s 	 	to	help	train	the	young	passenger	 pigeon 	 s 	 	how	to	flock	and	how	to	find	 the 	 ir 	 	way	to	 the 	 ir 	 	old	 nest 	 ing 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	and	 feed 	 ing 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	some	 conserv 	 ation 	 ists 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	famous	 conserv 	 ation 	 ists 	 	like	stanley	temple	,	who	is	one	of	the	 founder 	 s 	 	of	 conserv 	 ation 	 	biology	,	and	kate	jones	from	the	iucn	,	which	 do 	 es 	 	the	red	list	.
they	're	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	that	it	might	be	competitive	with	the	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 effort 	 s 	 	to	protect	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	that	are	still	 al 	 ive 	 	,	that	have	n't	gone	extinct	yet	.
you	see	,	you	want	to	work	on	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	 animal 	 s 	 	out	there	.
you	want	to	work	on	 get 	 ting 	 	the	market	for	 iv 	 ory 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	down	so	you	're	not	using	25,000	 elephant 	 s 	 	a	year	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	are	 real 	 izing 	 	that	bad	news	bums	people	out	.
and	so	the	red	list	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	keep	track	of	what	's	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	and	 critical 	 ly 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	,	and	so	on	.
but	they	're	about	to	create	what	they	call	a	green	list	,	and	the	green	list	will	have	species	that	are	 do 	 ing 	 	fine	,	thank	you	,	species	that	 we 	 re 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	,	like	the	bald	eagle	,	but	they	're	much	better	off	now	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	 every 	 body 	 	's	good	work	,	and	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	around	the	world	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 manage 	 d 	 	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	they	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	build	on	good	news	.
and	they	see	 re 	 viv 	 ing 	 	extinct	species	 a 	 s 	 	the	kind	of	good	news	you	might	be	able	to	build	on	.
here	's	a	couple	related	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
 captiv 	 e 	 	 breed 	 ing 	 	will	be	a	major	part	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	back	these	species	.
the	california	condor	was	down	to	22	 bird 	 s 	 	in	1987	.
 every 	 body 	 	thought	is	was	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	to	 captiv 	 e 	 	 breed 	 ing 	 	at	the	san	diego	zoo	,	there	's	405	of	them	now	,	226	are	out	in	the	wild	.
that	technology	will	be	used	on	de	-	extincted	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	success	story	is	the	mountain	gorilla	in	central	africa	.
in	1981	,	dian	fossey	was	 s 	 ure 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	extinct	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	just	254	left	.
now	there	are	880.	they	're	increasing	in	population	by	three	percent	a	year	.
the	secret	is	,	they	have	an	eco	-	 tour 	 ism 	 	program	,	which	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	was	taken	last	month	by	ryan	with	an	iphone	.
that	's	how	 comfort 	 able 	 	these	wild	 gorilla 	 s 	 	are	with	 visit 	 ors 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	project	,	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	going	to	need	some	help	,	is	the	 north 	 ern 	 	white	 rhino 	 ce 	 ros 	 	.
there	's	no	 breed 	 ing 	 	 pair 	 s 	 	left	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	thing	that	a	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	dna	for	 th 	 is 	 	animal	is	 avail 	 able 	 	in	the	 froze 	 n 	 	zoo	.
a	bit	of	 clon 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	get	them	back	.
so	where	do	we	go	from	here	?
these	have	 be 	 en 	 	private	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	so	far	.
i	think	it	's	time	for	the	subject	to	go	public	.
what	do	people	think	about	it	?
you	know	,	do	you	want	extinct	species	back	?
do	you	want	extinct	species	back	?
tinker	bell	is	going	to	come	fluttering	down	.
it	is	a	tinker	bell	moment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	are	people	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
what	are	they	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	?
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	push	 a 	 head 	 	with	the	passenger	pigeon	.
so	ben	novak	,	even	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	,	is	 join 	 ing 	 	the	group	that	beth	shapiro	 ha 	 s 	 	at	uc	santa	cruz	.
they	're	going	to	work	on	the	 genome 	 s 	 	of	the	passenger	pigeon	and	the	band	-	tailed	pigeon	.
 a 	 s 	 	that	data	 mature 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	george	church	,	who	will	work	his	magic	,	get	passenger	pigeon	dna	out	of	that	.
we	'll	get	help	from	bob	lanza	and	 mi 	 ke 	 	mcgrew	to	get	that	 in 	 to 	 	germ	plasm	that	can	go	 in 	 to 	 	 chicken 	 s 	 	that	can	produce	passenger	pigeon	squabs	that	can	be	raised	by	band	-	tailed	pigeon	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	then	from	then	on	,	it	's	passenger	 pigeon 	 s 	 	all	the	way	,	 may 	 be 	 	for	the	next	six	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
you	can	do	the	same	thing	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 cost 	 s 	 	come	down	,	for	the	carolina	parakeet	,	for	the	great	auk	,	for	the	heath	hen	,	for	the	 iv 	 ory 	 	-	 bill 	 ed 	 	 wood 	 peck 	 er 	 	,	for	the	eskimo	curlew	,	for	the	caribbean	monk	seal	,	for	the	 wool 	 ly 	 	 mamm 	 oth 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	fact	is	,	 human 	 s 	 	have	made	a	huge	hole	in	nature	in	the	last	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	have	the	ability	now	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	the	moral	 oblig 	 ation 	 	,	to	repair	some	of	the	damage	.
most	of	that	we	'll	do	by	 expand 	 ing 	 	and	 protect 	 ing 	 	 wild 	 land 	 s 	 	,	by	 expand 	 ing 	 	and	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	 population 	 s 	 	of	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	.
but	some	species	that	we	 kill 	 ed 	 	off	 total 	 ly 	 	we	could	consider	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	back	to	a	world	that	 mis 	 s 	 es 	 	them	.
thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	thank	you	.
i	've	got	a	question	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	.	some	people	stand	.
i	suspect	there	are	some	people	out	there	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	,	kind	of	 ask 	 ing 	 	 tor 	 ment 	 ed 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	,	about	,	well	,	wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	wait	a	minute	,	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	 man 	 kind 	 	 inter 	 fer 	 ing 	 	in	nature	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
there	's	going	to	be	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
you	're	going	to	uncork	some	sort	of	pandora	's	box	of	who	-	 know 	 s 	 	-	what	.	do	they	have	a	point	?
stewart	brand	:	well	,	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	point	is	we	 interfere 	 d 	 	in	a	big	way	by	making	these	 animal 	 s 	 	go	extinct	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 key 	 stone 	 	species	,	and	we	 change 	 d 	 	the	whole	 eco 	 system 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	by	 lett 	 ing 	 	them	go	.
now	,	there	's	the	shifting	 base 	 line 	 	problem	,	which	is	,	so	when	these	 thing 	 s 	 	come	back	,	they	might	replace	some	 bird 	 s 	 	that	are	there	that	people	 re 	 ally 	 	know	and	love	.
i	think	that	's	,	you	know	,	part	of	how	it	'll	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	long	,	 s 	 low 	 	process	--	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	like	about	it	,	it	's	multi	-	generation	.
we	will	get	 wool 	 ly 	 	mammoths	back	.
ca	:	well	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	both	the	conversation	and	the	potential	here	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	 thrill 	 ing 	 	.
thank	you	so	much	for	 present 	 ing 	 	.	sb	:	thank	you	.
ca	:	thank	you	.
