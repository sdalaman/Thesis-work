thank	you	.
for	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	that	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	,	all	i	ever	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	transcend	 poet 	 ry 	 	to	the	world	.
see	,	it	was	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	for	me	to	write	a	book	.
it	was	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	for	me	to	join	a	 s 	 lam 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	,	and	while	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	hold	weight	,	it	was	n't	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	force	that	 push 	 es 	 	the	pen	to	the	pad	.
the	 hung 	 er 	 	and	thirst	was	,	and	still	 remain 	 s 	 	:	how	do	i	get	people	who	hate	 poet 	 ry 	 	to	love	me	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	my	work	,	and	if	they	love	me	,	then	they	will	love	my	work	,	and	if	they	love	my	work	,	then	they	will	love	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	and	if	they	love	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	then	i	will	have	 d 	 one 	 	my	job	,	which	is	to	transcend	it	to	the	world	.
and	in	1996	,	i	found	the	answer	in	 principle 	 s 	 	in	a	master	spoken	-	word	artist	named	reg	e.	gaines	,	who	wrote	the	famous	poem	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	take	my	air	jordans	.	``
and	i	 follow 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 every 	 where 	 	 un 	 til 	 	i	had	him	in	the	room	,	and	i	read	him	one	of	my	 piece 	 s 	 	,	and	you	know	what	he	told	me	?
``	yo	'	wack	.
you	know	what	the	problem	is	with	you	,	homie	?
you	do	n't	read	other	people	's	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	got	any	 sub 	 ordin 	 ation 	 	for	verbal	 measure 	 s 	 	to	 ton 	 al 	 	 consider 	 ation 	 	.	``
now	he	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	 ram 	 bling 	 	about	 poet 	 ry 	 	and	 style 	 s 	 	and	nuyorican	friday	 night 	 s 	 	.
now	i	could	have	quit	.	i	should	have	quit	.
i	mean	,	i	thought	 poet 	 ry 	 	was	just	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	.
i	did	n't	know	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	have	creative	control	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	quitting	,	i	 follow 	 ed 	 	him	 every 	 where 	 	.
when	he	was	writing	a	broadway	show	,	i	would	be	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	door	.
i	would	wake	him	up	at	,	like	,	6:30	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	to	ask	him	who	's	the	best	poet	.
i	remember	eating	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	a	fish	right	out	of	the	sea	 be 	 cause 	 	he	told	me	it	was	brain	food	.
then	one	day	i	told	him	,	``	reg	e.	,	what	is	 sub 	 ordin 	 ation 	 	for	verbal	 measure 	 s 	 	to	 ton 	 al 	 	 consider 	 ation 	 	?	``
and	he	 hand 	 ed 	 	me	a	black	-	and	-	white	 print 	 ed 	 	out	thesis	on	a	poet	named	etheridge	 k 	 night 	 	and	the	 or 	 al 	 	nature	of	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	and	from	that	point	,	reggie	 stop 	 ped 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	the	best	to	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	etheridge	 k 	 night 	 	taught	me	was	that	i	could	make	my	 word 	 s 	 	sound	like	music	,	even	my	small	 one 	 s 	 	,	the	monosyllables	,	the	 if 	 s 	 	,	 and 	 s 	 	,	 but 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 s 	 	,	the	 gang 	 s 	 ta 	 	in	my	 s 	 l 	 ang 	 	could	fall	right	on	the	ear	,	and	from	then	on	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	chasing	etheridge	 k 	 night 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	which	poet	he	read	,	and	i	 land 	 ed 	 	on	a	poem	 call 	 ed 	 	[	``	dark	 prop 	 he 	 cy 	 	:	 s 	 ing 	 	of	shine	``	]	,	a	toast	signifying	that	got	me	on	the	 big 	 gest 	 	stage	a	poet	could	ever	be	:	broadway	,	baby	.
and	from	that	point	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	pull	the	mic	away	and	attack	the	 poet 	 ry 	 	with	my	body	.
but	that	was	n't	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 less 	 on 	 	i	ever	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	 less 	 on 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	when	i	went	to	beverly	 hill 	 s 	 	and	i	ran	 in 	 to 	 	a	talent	agent	who	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	up	and	down	and	 s 	 aid 	 	i	do	n't	look	like	i	have	any	experience	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	business	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	``	listen	,	 pun 	 k 	 	fool	,	you	're	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	 a 	 ctor 	 	who	 be 	 came 	 	an	agent	,	and	you	know	why	you	 fail 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	?
