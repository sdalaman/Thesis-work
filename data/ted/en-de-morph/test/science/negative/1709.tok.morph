so	just	by	a	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	all	have	a	robot	at	home	?
not	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	if	you	do	n't	include	roomba	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	a	robot	at	home	?
so	a	couple	.
that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
that	's	the	problem	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	solve	at	romotive	--	that	i	and	the	other	20	 nerd 	 s 	 	at	romotive	are	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	solving	.
so	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	build	a	robot	that	 any 	 one 	 	can	use	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	eight	or	80	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	build	a	small	,	 port 	 able 	 	robot	that	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 afford 	 able 	 	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	to	take	home	and	have	around	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	robot	ca	n't	be	 creep 	 y 	 	or	 un 	 can 	 ny 	 	.
he	should	be	friendly	and	cute	.
so	meet	romo	.
romo	's	a	robot	that	uses	a	 de 	 vice 	 	you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	and	love	--	your	iphone	--	 a 	 s 	 	his	brain	.
and	by	 lever 	 aging 	 	the	power	of	the	iphone	's	processor	,	we	can	create	a	robot	that	is	wi	-	fi	enabled	and	computer	vision	-	 cap 	 able 	 	for	150	 buck 	 s 	 	,	which	is	about	one	percent	of	what	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 robot 	 s 	 	have	cost	in	the	past	.
when	romo	 wake 	 s 	 	up	,	he	's	in	creature	mode	.
so	he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	using	the	video	camera	on	the	 de 	 vice 	 	to	follow	my	face	.
if	i	duck	down	,	he	'll	follow	me	.
he	's	 war 	 y 	 	,	so	he	'll	keep	his	 eye 	 s 	 	on	me	.
if	i	come	over	here	,	he	'll	turn	to	follow	me	.
if	i	come	over	here	--	he	's	smart	.
and	if	i	get	too	close	to	him	,	he	 get 	 s 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	just	like	any	other	creature	.
so	in	a	lot	of	ways	,	romo	is	like	a	pet	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mind	of	his	own	.
 thank 	 s 	 	,	little	guy	.
bless	you	.
and	if	i	want	to	explore	the	world	--	uh	-	oh	,	romo	's	 tire 	 d 	 	--	if	i	want	to	explore	the	world	with	romo	,	i	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	connect	him	from	any	other	ios	 de 	 vice 	 	.
so	here	's	the	ipad	.
and	romo	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	stream	video	to	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
so	i	can	see	 every 	 thing 	 	that	romo	 s 	 ees 	 	,	and	i	get	a	robot	's	-	eye	-	view	of	the	world	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	free	app	on	the	app	store	,	so	if	any	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	app	on	your	 phone 	 s 	 	,	we	could	 liter 	 ally 	 	right	now	share	control	of	the	robot	and	play	 game 	 s 	 	together	.
so	i	'll	show	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	romo	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	he	's	 stream 	 ing 	 	video	,	so	you	can	see	me	and	the	entire	ted	audience	.
if	i	get	in	front	of	romo	here	.
and	if	i	want	to	control	him	,	i	can	just	drive	.
so	i	can	drive	him	around	,	and	i	can	take	 picture 	 s 	 	of	you	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	a	picture	of	a	1,500	-	person	ted	audience	.
so	i	'll	snap	a	picture	.
and	in	the	same	way	that	you	scroll	through	content	on	an	ipad	,	i	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	adjust	the	angle	of	the	camera	on	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
so	there	are	all	of	you	through	romo	's	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	romo	is	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	me	,	i	can	express	 my 	 self 	 	through	his	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
so	i	can	go	in	and	i	can	say	let	's	make	romo	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
but	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	about	romo	is	that	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 liter 	 ally 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	intuitive	.
you	do	not	have	to	teach	 some 	 one 	 	how	to	drive	romo	.
in	fact	,	who	would	like	to	drive	a	robot	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	awesome	.
here	you	go	.
thank	you	,	scott	.
and	even	 cool 	 er 	 	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	have	to	be	in	the	same	 geo 	 graphic 	 	location	 a 	 s 	 	the	robot	to	control	him	.
so	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stream 	 s 	 	two	-	way	audio	and	video	between	any	two	smart	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
so	you	can	log	in	through	the	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	,	and	it	's	kind	of	like	skype	on	 wheel 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	before	about	 tele 	 presence 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
you	can	imagine	an	eight	-	year	-	old	girl	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	an	iphone	,	and	her	mom	 buy 	 s 	 	her	a	robot	.
that	girl	can	take	her	iphone	,	put	it	on	the	robot	,	 s 	 end 	 	an	email	to	grandma	,	who	 live 	 s 	 	on	the	other	side	of	the	country	.
grandma	can	log	 in 	 to 	 	that	robot	and	play	hide	-	and	-	go	-	seek	with	her	 grand 	 daughter 	 	for	fifteen	 minute 	 s 	 	every	single	night	,	when	 other 	 wise 	 	she	might	 on 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	get	to	see	her	 grand 	 daughter 	 	once	or	twice	a	year	.
 thank 	 s 	 	,	scott	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	a	couple	of	the	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	 thing 	 s 	 	that	romo	can	do	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	i	just	want	to	finish	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	in	the	future	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	one	of	our	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	dom	,	built	in	a	 week 	 end 	 	.
it	's	built	on	top	of	a	google	open	 frame 	 work 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	blockly	.
 th 	 is 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	drag	and	drop	these	 block 	 s 	 	of	semantic	code	and	create	any	behavior	for	 th 	 is 	 	robot	you	want	.
you	do	not	have	to	know	how	to	code	to	create	a	behavior	for	romo	.
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 simul 	 ate 	 	that	behavior	in	the	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	,	which	is	what	you	see	romo	 do 	 ing 	 	on	the	left	.
and	then	if	you	have	 some 	 thing 	 	you	like	,	you	can	download	it	onto	your	robot	and	execute	it	in	real	life	,	run	the	program	in	real	life	.
and	then	if	you	have	 some 	 thing 	 	you	're	proud	of	,	you	can	share	it	with	every	other	person	who	 own 	 s 	 	a	robot	in	the	world	.
so	all	of	these	wi	-	fi	--	enabled	 robot 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	learn	from	each	other	.
the	reason	we	're	so	focused	on	building	 robot 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	can	train	is	that	we	think	the	most	 compel 	 ling 	 	use	 case 	 s 	 	in	personal	 robotic 	 s 	 	are	personal	.
they	change	from	person	to	person	.
so	we	think	that	if	you	're	going	to	have	a	robot	in	your	home	,	that	robot	ought	to	be	a	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	your	own	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
so	i	wish	that	i	could	tell	you	what	the	future	of	personal	 robotic 	 s 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
to	be	honest	,	i	have	no	idea	.
but	what	we	do	know	is	that	it	is	n't	10	 year 	 s 	 	or	10	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	or	a	large	 human 	 oid 	 	robot	away	.
the	future	of	personal	 robotic 	 s 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	it	's	going	to	depend	on	small	,	 ag 	 ile 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	like	romo	and	the	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	of	people	like	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	we	ca	n't	wait	to	get	you	all	 robot 	 s 	 	,	and	we	ca	n't	wait	to	see	what	you	build	.
thank	you	.
