i	was	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	that	,	every	time	i	got	in	the	car	,	i	 bas 	 ically 	 	had	to	roll	down	the	window	.
it	was	 usual 	 ly 	 	too	hot	,	too	 stuff 	 y 	 	or	just	too	 smell 	 y 	 	,	and	my	father	would	not	let	us	use	the	air	 condition 	 er 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	it	would	 over 	 heat 	 	the	engine	.
and	you	might	remember	,	some	of	you	,	how	the	 car 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	back	then	,	and	it	was	a	common	problem	of	 over 	 heat 	 ing 	 	.
but	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	the	signal	that	 cap 	 ped 	 	the	use	,	or	overuse	,	of	energy	-	 consum 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
 thing 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	now	.	we	have	 car 	 s 	 	that	we	take	 a 	 cross 	 	country	.
we	blast	the	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	the	entire	way	,	and	we	never	experience	 over 	 heat 	 ing 	 	.
so	there	's	no	more	signal	for	us	to	tell	us	to	stop	.
great	,	right	?	well	,	we	have	similar	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 building 	 s 	 	.
in	the	past	,	before	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	,	we	had	thick	 wall 	 s 	 	.
the	thick	 wall 	 s 	 	are	great	for	 insula 	 tion 	 	.	it	 keep 	 s 	 	the	 in 	 terior 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 summer 	 time 	 	,	and	warm	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 winter 	 time 	 	,	and	the	small	 window 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 limit 	 ed 	 	the	amount	of	temperature	transfer	between	the	 in 	 terior 	 	and	 ex 	 terior 	 	.
then	in	about	the	1930s	,	with	the	 ad 	 vent 	 	of	plate	glass	,	 roll 	 ed 	 	steel	and	mass	production	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	make	floor	-	to	-	 ceil 	 ing 	 	 window 	 s 	 	and	unobstructed	 view 	 s 	 	,	and	with	that	came	the	 ir 	 revers 	 ible 	 	 reli 	 ance 	 	on	 mechanic 	 al 	 	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	to	cool	our	solar	-	heated	 space 	 s 	 	.
over	time	,	the	 building 	 s 	 	got	 tall 	 er 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	,	our	 engineer 	 ing 	 	even	better	,	so	that	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	massive	.	they	 requir 	 e 	 	a	huge	amount	of	energy	.
they	give	off	a	lot	of	heat	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	,	and	for	some	of	you	may	understand	the	heat	 is 	 land 	 	effect	in	cities	,	where	the	urban	 area 	 s 	 	are	much	more	warm	than	the	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 problem 	 s 	 	that	,	when	we	lose	power	,	we	ca	n't	open	a	window	here	,	and	so	the	 building 	 s 	 	are	uninhabitable	and	have	to	be	made	 vac 	 ant 	 	 un 	 til 	 	that	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	system	can	start	up	 aga 	 in 	 	.
even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	with	our	 intent 	 ion 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 building 	 s 	 	move	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	net	-	zero	energy	state	,	we	ca	n't	do	it	just	by	making	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	more	and	more	efficient	.
we	need	to	look	for	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	and	we	've	gotten	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	little	bit	 in 	 to 	 	a	rut	.
so	what	do	we	do	here	?	how	do	we	pull	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	dig	us	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	hole	that	we	've	 d 	 ug 	 	?
if	we	look	at	biology	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	n't	know	,	i	was	a	biology	major	before	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	the	human	skin	is	the	organ	that	 natural 	 ly 	 	 regulat 	 es 	 	the	temperature	in	the	body	,	and	it	's	a	fantastic	thing	.
that	's	the	first	line	of	defense	for	the	body	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 pore 	 s 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	sweat	 g 	 land 	 s 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	work	together	 ver 	 y 	 	 dynamic 	 ally 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 efficient 	 ly 	 	,	and	so	what	i	 pro 	 pose 	 	is	that	our	building	 skin 	 s 	 	should	be	more	similar	to	human	skin	,	and	by	 do 	 ing 	 	so	can	be	much	more	dynamic	,	 respons 	 ive 	 	and	 different 	 iated 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	where	it	is	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 get 	 s 	 	me	back	to	my	research	.
what	i	 pro 	 posed 	 	first	 do 	 ing 	 	is	looking	at	a	different	material	 pal 	 ette 	 	to	do	that	.
i	 present 	 ly 	 	,	or	 current 	 ly 	 	,	work	with	smart	 material 	 s 	 	,	and	a	smart	thermo	-	bimetal	.
first	of	all	,	i	guess	we	call	it	smart	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 requir 	 es 	 	no	 control 	 s 	 	and	it	 requir 	 es 	 	no	energy	,	and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	deal	for	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
what	it	is	,	it	's	a	lamination	of	two	different	 metal 	 s 	 	together	.
you	can	see	that	here	by	the	different	 reflect 	 ion 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	two	different	 co 	 efficient 	 s 	 	of	expansion	,	when	heated	,	one	side	will	expand	 fast 	 er 	 	than	the	other	and	result	in	a	 curl 	 ing 	 	action	.
so	in	early	 prototype 	 s 	 	i	built	these	 surface 	 s 	 	to	try	to	see	how	the	curl	would	react	to	temperature	and	possibly	allow	air	to	 ventil 	 ate 	 	through	the	system	,	and	in	other	 prototype 	 s 	 	did	 surface 	 s 	 	where	the	 multi 	 plicit 	 y 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	these	 strip 	 s 	 	together	can	try	to	make	 big 	 ger 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	happen	when	 al 	 so 	 	heated	,	and	 current 	 ly 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	at	the	 material 	 s 	 	&	 application 	 s 	 	 gall 	 ery 	 	in	silver	lake	,	close	by	,	and	it	's	there	 un 	 til 	 	august	,	if	you	want	to	see	it	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	bloom	,	``	and	the	surface	is	made	 complete 	 ly 	 	out	of	thermo	-	bimetal	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 intent 	 ion 	 	is	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	 can 	 opy 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.	one	,	it	's	a	 s 	 un 	 	-	 s 	 had 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	so	that	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	the	surface	,	it	 con 	 strict 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	 s 	 un 	 	 pass 	 ing 	 	through	,	and	in	other	 area 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	 ventil 	 ating 	 	system	,	so	that	hot	,	trapped	air	 under 	 neath 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	move	through	and	out	when	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
you	can	see	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	time	-	lapse	video	that	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 move 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	surface	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 sha 	 de 	 	,	each	of	the	 tile 	 s 	 	 move 	 s 	 	 individual 	 ly 	 	.
keep	in	mind	,	with	the	digital	technology	that	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	thing	was	made	out	of	about	14,000	 piece 	 s 	 	and	there	's	no	two	 piece 	 s 	 	 a 	 like 	 	at	all	.	every	single	one	is	different	.
and	the	great	thing	with	that	is	the	fact	that	we	can	calibrate	each	one	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	to	 it 	 s 	 	location	,	to	the	angle	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	how	the	thing	 actual 	 ly 	 	 curl 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	proof	of	 con 	 cept 	 	project	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 implic 	 ations 	 	to	actual	future	application	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	here	you	see	a	house	,	that	's	for	a	 develop 	 er 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	four	-	story	glass	box	.
it	's	still	with	that	glass	box	 be 	 cause 	 	we	still	want	that	visual	access	,	but	now	it	's	sheathed	with	 th 	 is 	 	thermo	-	bimetal	layer	,	it	's	a	screen	that	 go 	 es 	 	around	it	,	and	that	layer	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	open	and	close	 a 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 un 	 	 move 	 s 	 	around	on	that	surface	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	,	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	screen	 area 	 s 	 	for	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	,	so	that	it	can	 different 	 iate 	 	from	some	of	the	public	 area 	 s 	 	in	the	space	 dur 	 ing 	 	different	 time 	 s 	 	of	day	.
and	what	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 im 	 plies 	 	is	that	,	in	 house 	 s 	 	now	,	we	do	n't	need	 d 	 rape 	 s 	 	or	 shut 	 ter 	 s 	 	or	 blind 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	 s 	 heath 	 	the	building	with	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	control	the	amount	of	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	you	need	 in 	 side 	 	that	building	.
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	looking	at	 try 	 ing 	 	to	develop	some	building	 component 	 s 	 	for	the	market	,	and	so	here	you	see	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	typical	double	-	 glaz 	 ed 	 	window	 pan 	 el 	 	,	and	in	that	 pan 	 el 	 	,	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 piece 	 s 	 	of	glass	,	that	double	-	glazing	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	work	on	making	a	thermo	-	bimetal	pattern	system	so	that	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	that	 out 	 side 	 	layer	and	 heat 	 s 	 	that	 in 	 terior 	 	cavity	,	that	thermo	-	bimetal	will	begin	to	curl	,	and	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	will	happen	then	is	it	'll	start	to	block	out	the	 s 	 un 	 	in	certain	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	building	,	and	 total 	 ly 	 	,	if	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
and	so	you	can	imagine	,	even	in	 th 	 is 	 	application	,	that	in	a	high	-	rise	building	where	the	 pan 	 el 	 	 system 	 s 	 	go	from	floor	to	floor	up	to	30	,	40	 floor 	 s 	 	,	the	entire	surface	could	be	 different 	 iated 	 	at	different	 time 	 s 	 	of	day	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	that	 s 	 un 	 	 move 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	and	 hit 	 s 	 	that	surface	.
and	these	are	some	 lat 	 er 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	right	now	that	are	on	the	 board 	 s 	 	,	where	you	can	see	,	in	the	bottom	right	-	hand	corner	,	with	the	red	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 small 	 er 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	thermometal	,	and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	it	move	like	 cili 	 a 	 	or	 eye 	 lash 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	last	project	is	 al 	 so 	 	of	 component 	 s 	 	.
the	influence	--	and	if	you	have	 notice 	 d 	 	,	one	of	my	 sphere 	 s 	 	of	influence	is	biology	--	is	from	a	 grass 	 hopper 	 	.
and	 grass 	 hopper 	 s 	 	have	a	different	kind	of	 breath 	 ing 	 	system	.
they	breathe	through	 hole 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 side 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	spiracles	,	and	they	 br 	 ing 	 	the	air	through	and	it	 move 	 s 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	system	to	cool	them	down	,	and	so	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	how	we	can	consider	that	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	too	,	how	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	air	through	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	 side 	 s 	 	of	a	building	.
and	so	you	see	here	some	early	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 block 	 s 	 	,	where	 t 	 hose 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	coming	through	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	before	the	thermo	-	bimetal	is	 appli 	 ed 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	after	the	bimetal	is	 appli 	 ed 	 	.	sorry	,	it	's	a	little	hard	to	see	,	but	on	the	 surface 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	these	red	 arrow 	 s 	 	.
on	the	left	,	it	's	when	it	's	cold	and	the	thermo	-	bimetal	is	flat	so	it	will	 con 	 strict 	 	air	from	 pass 	 ing 	 	through	the	 block 	 s 	 	,	and	on	the	right	,	the	thermo	-	bimetal	 curl 	 s 	 	and	 allow 	 s 	 	that	air	to	pass	through	,	so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	two	different	 component 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	imagine	that	air	could	 potential 	 ly 	 	be	coming	through	the	 wall 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 open 	 ing 	 	 window 	 s 	 	.
so	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	one	last	impression	about	the	project	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	work	and	using	smart	 material 	 s 	 	.
when	you	're	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 open 	 ing 	 	and	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 blind 	 s 	 	day	after	day	,	when	you	're	on	 vac 	 ation 	 	and	there	's	no	one	there	on	the	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	to	be	 turn 	 ing 	 	off	and	on	the	 control 	 s 	 	,	or	when	there	's	a	power	outage	,	and	you	have	no	 electric 	 ity 	 	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	,	these	thermo	-	bimetals	will	still	be	 work 	 ing 	 	 tire 	 lessly 	 	,	 efficient 	 ly 	 	and	 end 	 lessly 	 	.	thank	you	.
