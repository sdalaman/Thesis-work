 a 	 cross 	 	europe	and	central	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	 approximate 	 ly 	 	one	million	children	live	in	large	 resident 	 ial 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	 orphan 	 age 	 s 	 	.
most	people	imagine	 orphan 	 age 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	benign	environment	that	care	for	children	.
 other 	 s 	 	know	more	about	the	living	 condition 	 s 	 	there	,	but	still	think	they	're	a	 necess 	 ary 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	.
after	all	,	where	else	would	we	put	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	children	who	do	n't	have	any	 parent 	 s 	 	?
but	60	 year 	 s 	 	of	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 demonst 	 rated 	 	that	 separat 	 ing 	 	children	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	placing	them	in	large	 institution 	 s 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	 harm 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	health	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	true	for	young	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	know	,	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	born	 with 	 out 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	full	muscle	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	and	that	 include 	 s 	 	the	brain	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	first	three	 year 	 s 	 	of	life	,	the	brain	 grow 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	full	 s 	 ize 	 	,	with	most	of	that	growth	taking	place	in	the	first	six	 month 	 s 	 	.	the	brain	 develop 	 s 	 	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	experience	and	to	 stimul 	 ation 	 	.
every	time	a	young	baby	 learn 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	new	--	to	focus	 it 	 s 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	to	mimic	a	 move 	 ment 	 	or	a	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	,	to	pick	 some 	 thing 	 	up	,	to	form	a	word	or	to	 s 	 it 	 	up	--	new	 syn 	 apt 	 ic 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	built	in	the	brain	.
new	 parent 	 s 	 	are	 astonish 	 ed 	 	by	the	 rapid 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
they	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 right 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	and	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	children	's	 clever 	 ness 	 	.
they	communicate	 the 	 ir 	 	 de 	 light 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	who	respond	with	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	,	and	a	 desir 	 e 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	more	and	to	learn	more	.
 th 	 is 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	of	the	 power 	 ful 	 	 attach 	 ment 	 	between	child	and	parent	 provide 	 s 	 	the	building	 block 	 s 	 	for	physical	,	social	,	language	,	cognitive	and	 psycho 	 motor 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
it	is	the	model	for	all	future	 relationship 	 s 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	,	with	 partner 	 s 	 	and	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	children	.
it	 happen 	 s 	 	so	 natural 	 ly 	 	in	most	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	that	we	do	n't	even	notice	it	.	most	of	us	are	 un 	 aware 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	to	human	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	,	by	 extens 	 ion 	 	,	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	a	 health 	 y 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	when	it	 go 	 es 	 	wrong	that	we	start	to	 real 	 ize 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	to	children	.
in	august	,	1993	,	i	had	my	first	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	witness	on	a	massive	scale	the	impact	on	children	of	 institution 	 al 	 ization 	 	and	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 parent 	 ing 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	remember	the	 news 	 paper 	 	 report 	 s 	 	that	came	out	of	romania	after	the	1989	revolution	will	recall	the	 horr 	 ors 	 	of	the	 condition 	 s 	 	in	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	help	the	director	of	a	large	institution	to	help	prevent	the	 separat 	 ion 	 	of	children	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
housing	550	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	ceausescu	's	show	 orphan 	 age 	 	,	and	so	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	told	the	 condition 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	much	better	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	young	children	,	i	 expect 	 ed 	 	the	institution	to	be	a	riot	of	noise	,	but	it	was	 a 	 s 	 	silent	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 vent 	 	.
it	was	hard	to	 believ 	 e 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	any	children	there	at	all	,	yet	the	director	 show 	 ed 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	room	after	room	,	each	 contain 	 ing 	 	row	 up 	 on 	 	row	of	 co 	 ts 	 	,	in	each	of	which	lay	a	child	 star 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
in	a	room	of	40	 new 	 born 	 s 	 	,	not	one	of	them	was	 cry 	 ing 	 	.
yet	i	could	see	 s 	 oil 	 ed 	 	 nap 	 pies 	 	,	and	i	could	see	that	some	of	the	children	 we 	 re 	 	 di 	 stress 	 ed 	 	,	but	the	 on 	 ly 	 	noise	was	a	low	,	 continu 	 ous 	 	moan	.
the	head	nurse	told	me	 proud 	 ly 	 	,	``	you	see	,	our	children	are	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	 behav 	 ed 	 	.	``
over	the	next	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 quiet 	 ness 	 	was	not	 exception 	 al 	 	.
the	 new 	 ly 	 	admitted	 bab 	 ies 	 	would	cry	for	the	first	few	 hour 	 s 	 	,	but	 the 	 ir 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	met	,	and	so	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	they	 learn 	 ed 	 	not	to	 both 	 er 	 	.	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 list 	 less 	 	,	 let 	 ha 	 rgic 	 	,	and	 star 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	like	all	the	 other 	 s 	 	.
over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	and	news	 report 	 s 	 	have	 blame 	 d 	 	the	 person 	 nel 	 	in	the	 institution 	 s 	 	for	the	harm	 caus 	 ed 	 	to	the	children	,	but	often	,	one	member	of	staff	is	 car 	 ing 	 	for	10	,	20	,	and	even	40	children	.
 h 	 ence 	 	they	have	no	option	but	to	implement	a	 regimen 	 ted 	 	program	.
the	children	must	be	 wok 	 en 	 	at	7	and	fed	at	7:30	.
at	8	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 nap 	 pies 	 	must	be	 change 	 d 	 	,	so	a	staff	member	may	have	 on 	 ly 	 	30	 minute 	 s 	 	to	feed	10	or	20	children	.
if	a	child	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 nap 	 py 	 	at	8:30	,	he	will	have	to	wait	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	before	it	can	be	 change 	 d 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	child	's	 dai 	 ly 	 	contact	with	 an 	 other 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	is	 reduc 	 ed 	 	to	a	few	hurried	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 feed 	 ing 	 	and	changing	,	and	 other 	 wise 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 stimul 	 ation 	 	is	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	the	 wall 	 s 	 	or	the	 bar 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 co 	 ts 	 	.
since	my	first	visit	to	ceausescu	's	institution	,	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 uch 	 	 place 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	18	 count 	 ries 	 	,	from	the	czech	 re 	 public 	 	to	sudan	.
 a 	 cross 	 	all	of	these	 divers 	 e 	 	 land 	 s 	 	and	 culture 	 s 	 	,	the	 institution 	 s 	 	,	and	the	child	's	journey	through	them	,	is	 depress 	 ing 	 ly 	 	similar	.
lack	of	 stimul 	 ation 	 	often	 lead 	 s 	 	to	self	-	 stimul 	 ating 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	like	hand	-	flapping	,	 rock 	 ing 	 	back	and	forth	,	or	 aggress 	 ion 	 	,	and	in	some	 institution 	 s 	 	,	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	are	used	to	control	the	behavior	of	these	children	,	whilst	in	 other 	 s 	 	,	children	are	 ti 	 ed 	 	up	to	prevent	them	from	 harm 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	or	 other 	 s 	 	.
these	children	are	 quick 	 ly 	 	 label 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 abilities 	 	and	 transfer 	 red 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	institution	for	children	with	 dis 	 abilities 	 	.
most	of	these	children	will	never	 leav 	 e 	 	the	institution	 aga 	 in 	 	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 dis 	 abilities 	 	,	at	age	three	,	they	're	 transfer 	 red 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	institution	,	and	at	age	seven	,	to	yet	 an 	 other 	 	.	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	age	and	gender	,	they	are	 arbitr 	 arily 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	,	often	 with 	 out 	 	even	a	chance	to	say	 good 	 bye 	 	.
there	's	 rare 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	eat	.	they	are	often	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
the	 old 	 er 	 	children	 bull 	 y 	 	the	little	 one 	 s 	 	.	they	learn	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.	they	learn	to	defend	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	or	they	go	under	.
when	they	 leav 	 e 	 	the	institution	,	they	find	it	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	to	cope	and	to	integrate	 in 	 to 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
in	moldova	,	young	women	raised	in	 institution 	 s 	 	are	10	 time 	 s 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 traffic 	 ked 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 peer 	 s 	 	,	and	a	russian	 stud 	 y 	 	found	that	two	 year 	 s 	 	after	 leav 	 ing 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	,	young	 adult 	 s 	 	,	20	percent	of	them	had	a	criminal	record	,	14	percent	 we 	 re 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	,	and	10	percent	had	taken	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	why	are	there	so	 man 	 y 	 	 orphan 	 s 	 	in	europe	when	there	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	a	great	deal	of	war	or	disaster	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	?
in	fact	,	more	than	95	percent	of	these	children	have	living	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	 socie 	 ties 	 	tend	to	blame	these	 parent 	 s 	 	for	 abandon 	 ing 	 	these	children	,	but	research	 show 	 s 	 	that	most	 parent 	 s 	 	want	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	and	that	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 driver 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 institution 	 al 	 ization 	 	are	poverty	,	 dis 	 ability 	 	and	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	have	not	 develop 	 ed 	 	inclusive	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	so	even	children	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	mild	 dis 	 ability 	 	are	 s 	 ent 	 	away	to	a	 resident 	 ial 	 	special	school	,	at	age	six	or	seven	.
the	institution	may	be	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	away	from	the	family	home	.
if	the	family	's	poor	,	they	find	it	difficult	to	visit	,	and	 gradu 	 ally 	 	the	relationship	 break 	 s 	 	down	.
 be 	 hind 	 	each	of	the	million	children	in	 institution 	 s 	 	,	there	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	a	story	of	 parent 	 s 	 	who	are	desperate	and	feel	they	've	run	out	of	 option 	 s 	 	,	like	natalia	in	moldova	,	who	 on 	 ly 	 	had	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	feed	her	baby	,	and	so	had	to	 s 	 end 	 	her	 old 	 er 	 	son	to	the	institution	;	or	desi	,	in	bulgaria	,	who	 look 	 ed 	 	after	her	four	children	at	home	 un 	 til 	 	her	husband	 di 	 ed 	 	,	but	then	she	had	to	go	out	to	work	full	time	,	and	with	no	support	,	felt	she	had	no	option	but	to	place	a	child	with	 dis 	 abilities 	 	in	an	institution	;	or	the	 count 	 less 	 	young	 girl 	 s 	 	too	 terr 	 ified 	 	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	they	're	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	who	 leav 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	a	hospital	;	or	the	new	 parent 	 s 	 	,	the	young	couple	who	have	just	found	out	that	 the 	 ir 	 	firstborn	child	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 dis 	 ability 	 	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 provide 	 d 	 	with	positive	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	child	's	potential	,	are	told	by	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	``	forget	her	,	 leav 	 e 	 	her	in	the	institution	,	go	home	and	make	a	 health 	 y 	 	one	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	state	of	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	is	 n 	 either 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	nor	is	it	 inevit 	 able 	 	.
every	child	 ha 	 s 	 	the	right	to	a	family	,	 deserve 	 s 	 	and	 need 	 s 	 	a	family	,	and	children	are	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 resili 	 ent 	 	.
we	find	that	if	we	get	them	out	of	 institution 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 to 	 	loving	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	early	on	,	they	 re 	 cover 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 develop 	 mental 	 	 delay 	 s 	 	,	and	go	on	to	lead	normal	,	happy	 live 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	much	 cheap 	 er 	 	to	provide	support	to	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	than	it	is	to	provide	 institution 	 s 	 	.
one	 stud 	 y 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	a	family	support	service	 cost 	 s 	 	10	percent	of	an	 institution 	 al 	 	placement	,	whilst	good	quality	foster	care	 cost 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	about	30	percent	.
if	we	 s 	 pend 	 	less	on	these	children	but	on	the	right	 service 	 s 	 	,	we	can	take	the	 saving 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 invest 	 	them	in	high	quality	 resident 	 ial 	 	care	for	 t 	 hose 	 	few	children	with	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	complex	 need 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 cross 	 	europe	,	a	 move 	 ment 	 	is	growing	to	shift	the	focus	and	transfer	the	 resource 	 s 	 	from	large	 institution 	 s 	 	that	provide	poor	quality	care	to	community	-	based	 service 	 s 	 	that	protect	children	from	harm	and	allow	them	to	develop	to	 the 	 ir 	 	full	potential	.	when	i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	to	work	in	romania	 near 	 ly 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	200,000	children	living	in	 institution 	 s 	 	,	and	more	 enter 	 ing 	 	every	day	.
now	,	there	are	less	than	10,000	,	and	family	support	 service 	 s 	 	are	 provide 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	.
in	moldova	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	poverty	and	the	 terr 	 ible 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	of	the	global	financial	crisis	,	the	 number 	 s 	 	of	children	in	 institution 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	by	more	than	50	percent	in	the	last	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 resource 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	to	family	support	 service 	 s 	 	and	inclusive	 school 	 s 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	national	action	 plan 	 s 	 	for	change	.
the	european	commission	and	other	major	 donor 	 s 	 	are	 find 	 ing 	 	ways	to	divert	money	from	 institution 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	family	support	,	 empower 	 ing 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	to	look	after	 the 	 ir 	 	own	children	.
but	there	is	still	much	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	end	the	 system 	 atic 	 	 institution 	 al 	 ization 	 	of	children	.
 aware 	 ness 	 	-	raising	is	 requir 	 ed 	 	at	every	level	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
people	need	to	know	the	harm	that	 institution 	 s 	 	cause	to	children	,	and	the	better	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	that	exist	.
if	we	know	people	who	are	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	support	 orphan 	 age 	 s 	 	,	we	should	 con 	 vince 	 	them	to	support	family	 service 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.
together	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	one	form	of	child	abuse	that	we	could	 eradic 	 ate 	 	in	our	 life 	 time 	 	.
thank	you	.
