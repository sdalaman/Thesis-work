so	i	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	 see 	 ing 	 	the	world	from	a	 total 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	point	of	view	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	world	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	the	micro	world	.
i	've	found	,	after	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	there	's	a	 magic 	 al 	 	world	 be 	 hind 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	that	can	be	 s 	 een 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	through	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	let	's	start	off	looking	at	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	not	-	so	-	small	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	see	with	our	naked	eye	,	and	that	's	a	bee	.	so	when	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	bee	,	it	's	about	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	here	,	it	's	about	a	centimeter	.
but	to	 re 	 ally 	 	see	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	the	bee	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciate	what	it	is	,	you	have	to	look	a	little	bit	 close 	 r 	 	.
so	that	's	just	the	eye	of	the	bee	with	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	and	now	all	of	a	sudden	you	can	see	that	the	bee	 ha 	 s 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	individual	 eye 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	ommatidia	,	and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 sensor 	 y 	 	 hair 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	so	they	know	when	they	're	right	up	close	to	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	ca	n't	see	in	stereo	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	go	 small 	 er 	 	,	here	is	a	human	hair	.
a	human	hair	is	about	the	 small 	 est 	 	thing	that	the	eye	can	see	.
it	's	about	a	tenth	of	a	millimeter	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	 small 	 er 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	about	ten	 time 	 s 	 	 small 	 er 	 	than	that	,	is	a	cell	.
so	you	could	fit	10	human	 cell 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	of	a	human	hair	.
so	when	we	would	look	at	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	i	 re 	 ally 	 	got	 involve 	 d 	 	in	biology	and	science	is	by	looking	at	living	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
when	i	first	saw	living	 cell 	 s 	 	in	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	i	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 enthrall 	 ed 	 	and	 amaz 	 ed 	 	at	what	they	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
so	if	you	look	at	the	cell	like	that	from	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	,	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	moving	all	over	the	place	.
 th 	 is 	 	cell	is	looking	for	foreign	 object 	 s 	 	,	bacteria	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	it	can	find	.
and	it	's	looking	around	,	and	when	it	 find 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 ing 	 	foreign	,	it	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	engulf	it	and	eat	it	.
so	if	you	look	right	there	,	it	 find 	 s 	 	that	little	 bacter 	 ium 	 	,	and	it	engulfs	it	and	eats	it	.
if	you	take	some	heart	 cell 	 s 	 	from	an	animal	,	and	put	it	in	a	dish	,	they	'll	just	 s 	 it 	 	there	and	beat	.
that	's	 the 	 ir 	 	job	.	every	cell	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mission	in	life	,	and	these	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	mission	is	to	move	blood	around	our	body	.
these	next	 cell 	 s 	 	are	nerve	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	right	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	and	understand	what	we	're	looking	at	,	our	 brain 	 s 	 	and	our	nerve	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	right	now	.	they	're	not	just	static	.	they	're	moving	around	making	new	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	and	that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	learn	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	go	 far 	 ther 	 	down	 th 	 is 	 	scale	here	,	that	's	a	 micro 	 n 	 	,	or	a	 micro 	 meter 	 	,	and	we	go	all	the	way	down	to	here	to	a	 nano 	 meter 	 	and	an	angstrom	.	now	,	an	angstrom	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	of	a	hydrogen	atom	.
that	's	how	small	that	is	.
and	 micro 	 scope 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	individual	 atom 	 s 	 	.	so	these	are	some	 picture 	 s 	 	of	individual	 atom 	 s 	 	.	each	bump	here	is	an	individual	atom	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	ring	of	cobalt	 atom 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	whole	world	,	the	nano	world	,	 th 	 is 	 	area	in	here	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	nano	world	,	and	the	nano	world	,	the	whole	micro	world	that	we	see	,	there	's	a	nano	world	that	is	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	 with 	 in 	 	that	,	and	the	whole	--	and	that	is	the	world	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	 atom 	 s 	 	.
but	i	want	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	 large 	 r 	 	world	,	the	world	of	the	micro	world	.
so	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	bug	living	in	a	flower	,	what	would	that	flower	look	like	,	if	the	flower	was	 th 	 is 	 	big	?
it	would	n't	look	or	feel	like	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	see	when	we	look	at	a	flower	.	so	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	flower	here	,	and	you	're	a	little	bug	,	if	you	're	on	that	surface	of	that	flower	,	that	's	what	the	 terra 	 in 	 	would	look	like	.
the	 pet 	 al 	 	of	that	flower	 look 	 s 	 	like	that	,	so	the	ant	is	kind	of	 crawl 	 ing 	 	over	these	 object 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	look	a	little	bit	 close 	 r 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	stigma	and	the	stamen	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	style	of	that	flower	,	and	you	notice	that	it	's	got	these	little	--	these	are	like	little	jelly	-	like	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	what	are	 call 	 ed 	 	spurs	.	these	are	nectar	spurs	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	little	ant	that	's	 crawl 	 ing 	 	here	,	it	's	like	it	's	in	a	little	 will 	 y 	 	wonka	land	.
it	's	like	a	little	disneyland	for	them	.	it	's	not	like	what	we	see	.
these	are	little	bits	of	individual	grain	of	 poll 	 en 	 	there	and	there	,	and	here	is	a	--	what	you	see	 a 	 s 	 	one	little	yellow	dot	of	 poll 	 en 	 	,	when	you	look	in	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	little	 grain 	 s 	 	of	 poll 	 en 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	you	see	bees	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	these	little	 plant 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 collect 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	 grain 	 s 	 	that	they	're	 collect 	 ing 	 	,	they	pack	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	and	they	take	it	back	to	the	hive	,	and	that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	 bee 	 hive 	 	,	the	wax	in	the	 bee 	 hive 	 	.	and	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	nectar	,	and	that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	honey	that	we	eat	.
here	's	a	close	-	up	picture	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	regular	picture	of	a	water	hyacinth	,	and	if	you	had	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	good	vision	,	with	your	naked	eye	,	you	'd	see	it	about	that	well	.
there	's	the	stamen	and	the	pistil	.	but	look	what	the	stamen	and	the	pistil	look	like	in	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	.	that	's	the	stamen	.
so	that	's	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	little	 grain 	 s 	 	of	 poll 	 en 	 	there	,	and	there	's	the	pistil	there	,	and	these	are	the	little	 thing 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	trichomes	.	and	that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	flower	give	a	 fragr 	 ance 	 	,	and	 plant 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	communicate	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 fragr 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	just	 ordin 	 ary 	 	sand	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	sand	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	first	saw	sand	from	maui	,	and	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	bit	of	sand	from	maui	.
so	sand	is	about	a	tenth	of	a	millimeter	in	 s 	 ize 	 	.
each	sand	grain	is	about	a	tenth	of	a	millimeter	in	 s 	 ize 	 	.
but	when	you	look	 close 	 r 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	look	at	what	's	there	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	you	have	microshells	there	.
you	have	 thing 	 s 	 	like	coral	.
you	have	 fragment 	 s 	 	of	other	 shell 	 s 	 	.	you	have	olivine	.
you	have	bits	of	a	 volcan 	 o 	 	.	there	's	a	little	bit	of	a	 volcan 	 o 	 	there	.	you	have	tube	 worm 	 s 	 	.
an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	array	of	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	exist	in	sand	.
and	the	reason	that	is	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	in	a	place	like	 th 	 is 	 	 is 	 land 	 	,	a	lot	of	the	sand	is	made	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	material	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 reef 	 s 	 	provide	a	place	where	all	these	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	or	 macro 	 scopic 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	grow	,	and	when	they	die	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 shell 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	break	up	and	they	make	 grain 	 s 	 	of	sand	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	coral	and	so	forth	.
so	here	's	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	picture	of	sand	from	maui	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	lahaina	,	and	when	we	're	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	a	beach	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	and	 geo 	 logical 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	it	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	record	of	that	entire	 eco 	 logy 	 	.
so	here	we	see	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	sponge	spicule	,	two	bits	of	coral	here	,	that	's	a	sea	urchin	 s 	 pine 	 	.	 re 	 ally 	 	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
so	when	i	first	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	was	--	i	thought	,	gee	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	a	little	 treasu 	 re 	 	trove	here	.
i	could	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	and	i	'd	go	around	 dissect 	 ing 	 	the	little	bits	out	and	making	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	them	.
here	's	what	most	of	the	sand	in	our	world	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
these	are	 quar 	 tz 	 	 crystal 	 s 	 	and	feldspar	,	so	most	sand	in	the	world	on	the	 main 	 land 	 	is	made	of	 quar 	 tz 	 	crystal	and	feldspar	.	it	's	the	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	of	granite	rock	.
so	 mountain 	 s 	 	are	built	up	,	and	they	erode	away	by	water	and	rain	and	ice	and	so	forth	,	and	they	 be 	 come 	 	 grain 	 s 	 	of	sand	.
there	's	some	sand	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	much	more	 color 	 ful 	 	.
these	are	sand	from	near	the	great	 lake 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	see	that	it	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 mineral 	 s 	 	like	pink	garnet	and	green	epidote	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 amaz 	 ing 	 	stuff	,	and	if	you	look	at	different	 sand 	 s 	 	from	different	 place 	 s 	 	,	every	single	beach	,	every	single	place	you	look	at	sand	,	it	's	different	.	here	's	from	big	sur	,	like	they	're	little	 jewel 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 place 	 s 	 	in	africa	where	they	do	the	 min 	 ing 	 	of	 jewel 	 s 	 	,	and	you	go	to	the	sand	where	the	 river 	 s 	 	have	the	sand	go	down	to	the	ocean	,	and	it	's	like	 liter 	 ally 	 	looking	at	 tin 	 y 	 	 jewel 	 s 	 	through	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
so	every	grain	of	sand	is	 un 	 ique 	 	.	every	beach	is	different	.
every	single	grain	is	different	.	there	are	no	two	 grain 	 s 	 	of	sand	 a 	 like 	 	in	the	world	.
every	grain	of	sand	is	coming	 some 	 where 	 	and	going	 some 	 where 	 	.
they	're	like	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	in	time	.
now	sand	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	on	earth	,	but	sand	is	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	in	fact	,	 out 	 er 	 	space	is	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	sand	,	and	that	sand	 come 	 s 	 	together	to	make	our	 planet 	 s 	 	and	the	moon	.
and	you	can	see	 t 	 hose 	 	in	micrometeorites	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	micrometeorites	that	the	 arm 	 y 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	,	and	they	get	these	out	of	the	 drink 	 ing 	 	 well 	 s 	 	in	the	south	pole	.
and	they	're	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	-	looking	,	and	these	are	the	 tin 	 y 	 	 constit 	 uent 	 s 	 	that	make	up	the	world	that	we	live	in	--	the	 planet 	 s 	 	and	the	moon	.
so	nasa	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	take	some	 picture 	 s 	 	of	moon	sand	,	so	they	 s 	 ent 	 	me	sand	from	all	the	different	 land 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	apollo	 mission 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	 picture 	 s 	 	with	my	three	-	dimensional	 micro 	 scope 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	picture	i	took	.	it	was	kind	of	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
i	thought	it	 look 	 ed 	 	kind	of	a	little	bit	like	the	moon	,	which	is	sort	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	the	way	my	 micro 	 scope 	 s 	 	work	is	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	in	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	you	can	see	 ver 	 y 	 	little	at	one	time	,	so	what	you	have	to	do	is	you	have	to	 re 	 focus 	 	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	keep	taking	 picture 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	have	a	computer	program	that	 put 	 s 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	together	 in 	 to 	 	one	picture	so	you	can	see	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	and	i	do	that	in	3d	.	so	there	,	you	can	see	,	is	a	left	-	eye	view	.	there	's	a	right	-	eye	view	.
so	sort	of	left	-	eye	view	,	right	-	eye	view	.
now	 some 	 thing 	 	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	here	.	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	than	any	sand	on	earth	that	i	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	a	lot	of	sand	on	earth	,	 believ 	 e 	 	me	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	hole	in	the	middle	.	that	hole	was	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	a	micrometeorite	hitting	the	moon	.
now	,	the	moon	 ha 	 s 	 	no	atmosphere	,	so	micrometeorites	come	in	 continu 	 ously 	 	,	and	the	whole	surface	of	the	moon	is	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	powder	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	for	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 bombard 	 ed 	 	by	micrometeorites	,	and	when	micrometeorites	come	in	at	about	20	to	60,000	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	they	vaporize	on	contact	.
and	you	can	see	here	that	that	is	--	that	's	sort	of	 vapor 	 ized 	 	,	and	that	material	is	 hold 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	 c 	 lump 	 	of	little	sand	 grain 	 s 	 	together	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	grain	of	sand	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	.
and	that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	ring	agglutinate	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 grain 	 s 	 	of	sand	on	the	moon	look	like	that	,	and	you	'd	never	find	that	on	earth	.
most	of	the	sand	on	the	moon	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	--	and	you	know	when	you	look	at	the	moon	,	there	's	the	dark	 area 	 s 	 	and	the	light	 area 	 s 	 	.	the	dark	 area 	 s 	 	are	lava	 flow 	 s 	 	.	they	're	basaltic	lava	 flow 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	sand	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	the	sand	that	you	would	see	in	haleakala	.
other	 sand 	 s 	 	,	when	these	micrometeorites	come	in	,	they	vaporize	and	they	make	these	 fountain 	 s 	 	,	these	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 fountain 	 s 	 	that	go	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	--	i	was	going	to	say	``	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	,	``	but	there	is	no	air	--	 go 	 es 	 	sort	of	up	,	and	these	 micro 	 scopic 	 	glass	 be 	 ad 	 s 	 	are	 form 	 ed 	 	 instant 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	harden	,	and	by	the	time	they	fall	down	back	to	the	surface	of	the	moon	,	they	have	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	glass	 s 	 ph 	 e 	 rule 	 s 	 	.
and	these	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 micro 	 scopic 	 	;	you	need	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	to	see	these	.
now	here	's	a	grain	of	sand	that	is	from	the	moon	,	and	you	can	see	that	the	entire	crystal	structure	is	still	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	grain	of	sand	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	three	and	a	half	or	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	it	's	never	 erode 	 d 	 	away	like	the	way	we	have	sand	on	earth	 erode 	 s 	 	away	 be 	 cause 	 	of	water	and	tumbling	,	air	,	and	so	forth	.	all	you	can	see	is	a	little	bit	of	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	down	here	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	these	solar	 storm 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	by	solar	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
so	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	 thing 	 s 	 	even	 a 	 s 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	grain	of	sand	can	be	 tru 	 ly 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	if	you	look	 close 	 ly 	 	and	if	you	look	from	a	different	and	a	new	point	of	view	.
i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	best	put	by	william	blake	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	to	see	a	world	in	a	grain	of	sand	and	a	heaven	in	a	wild	flower	,	hold	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	in	the	palm	of	your	hand	,	and	 et 	 ern 	 ity 	 	in	an	hour	.	``
thank	you	.
