on	march	14	,	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	i	 post 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 post 	 er 	 	on	facebook	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	of	me	and	my	daughter	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	israeli	flag	.
i	will	try	to	explain	to	you	about	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	why	and	when	i	 post 	 ed 	 	.
a	few	 day 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	on	the	line	at	the	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	,	and	the	owner	and	one	of	the	 client 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	,	and	the	owner	was	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	the	client	that	we	're	going	to	get	10,000	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 s 	 	on	israel	.
and	the	client	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	no	,	it	's	10,000	a	day	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 con 	 text 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	are	now	in	israel	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	war	with	iran	coming	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	and	we	have	people	,	you	know	,	 af 	 raid 	 	.
it	's	like	every	year	it	's	the	last	minute	that	we	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	war	with	iran	.
it	's	like	,	if	we	do	n't	act	now	,	it	's	too	late	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
so	at	some	point	it	 be 	 came 	 	,	you	know	,	to	me	,	i	'm	a	graphic	 design 	 er 	 	,	so	i	made	 post 	 ers 	 	about	it	and	i	 post 	 ed 	 	the	one	i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	.
most	of	the	time	,	i	make	 post 	 ers 	 	,	i	post	them	on	facebook	,	my	 friend 	 s 	 	like	it	,	do	n't	like	it	,	most	of	the	time	do	n't	like	it	,	do	n't	share	it	,	do	n't	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	's	 an 	 other 	 	day	.
so	i	went	to	sleep	,	and	that	was	it	for	me	.
and	 lat 	 er 	 	on	in	the	night	,	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 wa 	 king 	 	up	in	the	night	,	and	i	went	by	the	computer	and	i	see	all	these	red	 dot 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	on	facebook	,	which	i	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
and	i	was	like	,	``	what	's	going	on	?	``
so	i	come	to	the	computer	and	i	start	looking	on	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	i	see	 man 	 y 	 	people	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	me	,	most	of	them	i	do	n't	know	,	and	a	few	of	them	from	iran	,	which	is	--	what	?
 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	understand	,	in	israel	we	do	n't	talk	with	people	from	iran	.
we	do	n't	know	people	from	iran	.
it	's	like	,	on	facebook	,	you	have	 friend 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	from	--	it	's	like	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	are	your	 friend 	 s 	 	on	facebook	.
and	now	people	from	iran	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
so	i	start	 answer 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	girl	,	and	she	's	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	she	saw	the	 post 	 er 	 	and	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	family	to	come	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	a	computer	,	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	family	to	come	to	see	the	 post 	 er 	 	,	and	they	're	all	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	living	room	 cry 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	'm	like	,	 who 	 a 	 	.
i	ask	my	wife	to	come	,	and	i	tell	her	,	you	have	to	see	that	.
people	are	 cry 	 ing 	 	,	and	she	came	,	she	read	the	text	,	and	she	 start 	 ed 	 	to	cry	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	's	 cry 	 ing 	 	now	.
so	i	do	n't	know	what	to	do	,	so	my	first	 re 	 flex 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	graphic	 design 	 er 	 	,	is	,	you	know	,	to	show	 every 	 body 	 	what	i	'd	just	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	people	 start 	 ed 	 	to	see	them	and	to	share	them	,	and	that	's	how	it	 start 	 ed 	 	.
the	day	after	,	when	 re 	 ally 	 	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	lot	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	my	wife	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	want	a	 post 	 er 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	her	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	,	put	me	in	a	 post 	 er 	 	now	.
but	more	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	i	was	like	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	these	 one 	 s 	 	work	,	but	it	's	not	just	about	me	,	it	's	about	people	from	israel	who	want	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	shoot	all	the	people	i	know	,	if	they	want	,	and	i	'm	going	to	put	them	in	a	 post 	 er 	 	and	i	'm	going	to	share	them	.
so	i	went	to	my	 neighbor 	 s 	 	and	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 student 	 s 	 	and	i	just	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	give	me	a	picture	,	i	will	make	you	a	 post 	 er 	 	.
and	that	's	how	it	 start 	 ed 	 	.	and	that	's	how	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	 unleash 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	people	from	facebook	,	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	just	understand	that	they	can	be	part	of	it	.
it	's	not	just	one	 du 	 de 	 	making	one	 post 	 er 	 	,	it	's	--	we	can	be	part	of	it	,	so	they	start	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	me	 picture 	 s 	 	and	ask	me	,	``	make	me	a	 post 	 er 	 	.	post	it	.
tell	the	iranians	we	from	israel	love	you	too	.	``
it	 be 	 came 	 	,	you	know	,	at	some	point	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	.
i	mean	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	,	so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	to	come	,	graphic	 design 	 ers 	 	most	of	them	,	to	make	 post 	 ers 	 	with	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	have	the	time	.
it	was	a	huge	amount	of	 picture 	 s 	 	.
so	for	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	that	's	how	my	living	room	was	.
and	we	 receiv 	 ed 	 	israeli	 post 	 ers 	 	,	israeli	 image 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 comment 	 s 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	from	iran	.
and	we	took	these	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	and	we	made	 post 	 ers 	 	out	of	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	people	:	they	do	n't	read	,	they	see	 image 	 s 	 	.
if	it	's	an	image	,	they	may	read	it	.
so	here	are	a	few	of	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	 re 	 ally 	 	moving	for	me	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	story	of	a	girl	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	raised	in	iran	to	walk	on	an	israeli	flag	to	enter	her	school	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	now	that	she	 s 	 ees 	 	the	 post 	 ers 	 	that	we	're	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	,	she	 start 	 s 	 	--	she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	she	 change 	 d 	 	her	mind	,	and	now	she	 love 	 s 	 	that	blue	,	she	 love 	 s 	 	that	star	,	and	she	 love 	 s 	 	that	flag	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	israeli	flag	,	and	she	 wish 	 ed 	 	that	we	'd	meet	and	come	to	visit	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	just	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	after	i	 post 	 ed 	 	the	first	 post 	 er 	 	.
the	day	after	,	iranians	 start 	 ed 	 	to	respond	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 post 	 ers 	 	.
they	have	graphic	 design 	 ers 	 	.	what	?
crazy	,	crazy	.
so	you	can	see	they	are	still	 s 	 hy 	 	,	they	do	n't	want	to	show	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	but	they	want	to	spread	the	 mess 	 age 	 	.
they	want	to	respond	.	they	want	to	say	the	same	thing	.
so	.	and	now	it	's	communication	.
it	's	a	two	-	way	story	.	it	's	israelis	and	iranians	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	the	same	 mess 	 age 	 	,	one	to	each	other	.
 th 	 is 	 	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	two	people	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 ene 	 mies 	 	,	we	're	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	a	war	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	people	on	facebook	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	``	i	like	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.	i	love	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	.	``
and	it	 be 	 came 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	big	at	some	point	.
and	then	it	 be 	 came 	 	news	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	middle	east	,	you	see	 on 	 ly 	 	the	bad	news	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	that	was	good	news	.	so	the	 guy 	 s 	 	on	the	news	,	they	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	let	's	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	they	just	came	,	and	it	was	so	much	,	i	remember	one	day	,	michal	,	she	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	the	journalist	,	and	she	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	him	,	``	who	's	gon	na	see	the	show	?	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 every 	 body 	 	.	``
so	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 every 	 body 	 	in	palestine	,	in	where	?	israel	?
who	is	 every 	 body 	 	?	``	``	 every 	 body 	 	.	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	syria	?	``	``	syria	.	``
``	lebanon	?	``	``	lebanon	.	``
at	some	point	,	he	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	40	million	people	are	going	to	see	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	's	 every 	 body 	 	.	``	the	chinese	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	story	.
 some 	 thing 	 	crazy	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
every	time	a	country	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	like	germany	,	america	,	 where 	 ver 	 	,	a	page	on	facebook	 pop 	 ped 	 	up	with	the	same	logo	with	the	same	 st 	 ories 	 	,	so	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	we	had	``	iran	-	 love 	 s 	 	-	israel	,	``	which	is	an	iranian	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	tehran	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	israel	 love 	 s 	 	iran	?
i	give	you	iran	-	 love 	 s 	 	-	israel	.	``
you	have	palestine	-	 love 	 s 	 	-	israel	.
you	have	lebanon	that	just	--	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	whole	list	of	 page 	 s 	 	on	facebook	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	the	same	 mess 	 age 	 	,	to	people	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	love	,	one	to	each	other	.
the	moment	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	a	friend	of	mine	told	me	,	``	google	the	word	'	israel	.	'	``	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	 image 	 s 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	that	 pop 	 ped 	 	up	from	google	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	 ty 	 ping 	 	,	``	israel	``	or	``	iran	.	``
we	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	how	people	see	the	middle	east	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	not	in	the	middle	east	.
you	're	 some 	 where 	 	over	there	,	and	then	you	want	to	see	the	middle	east	,	so	you	go	on	google	and	you	say	,	``	israel	,	``	and	they	give	you	the	bad	stuff	.
and	for	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	you	got	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	the	israel	-	 love 	 s 	 	-	iran	page	is	 th 	 is 	 	number	,	80,831	,	and	two	million	people	last	week	went	on	the	page	and	 share 	 d 	 	,	 like 	 d 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	,	 comment 	 ed 	 	on	one	of	the	 photo 	 s 	 	.
so	for	five	 month 	 s 	 	now	,	that	's	what	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	me	,	michal	,	a	few	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	are	just	making	 image 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 show 	 ing 	 	a	new	 re 	 ality 	 	by	just	making	 image 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	how	the	world	 perceive 	 s 	 	us	.
they	see	 image 	 s 	 	of	us	,	and	they	see	bad	 image 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	making	good	 image 	 s 	 	.	end	of	story	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	one	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	iran	-	 love 	 s 	 	-	israel	page	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	israel	-	 love 	 s 	 	-	iran	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	my	page	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	guy	in	tehran	on	the	day	of	 rem 	 embr 	 ance 	 	of	the	israeli	 fall 	 en 	 	soldier	 put 	 ting 	 	an	image	of	an	israeli	soldier	on	his	page	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ene 	 my 	 	.
what	?
and	it	's	going	both	ways	.
it	's	like	,	we	are	 show 	 ing 	 	respect	,	one	to	each	other	.
and	we	're	 understand 	 ing 	 	.	and	you	show	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
and	you	 be 	 come 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	at	some	point	,	you	 be 	 come 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	on	facebook	,	and	you	 be 	 come 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	in	life	.
you	can	go	and	travel	and	meet	people	.
and	i	was	in	munich	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	went	there	to	open	an	 ex 	 position 	 	about	iran	and	i	met	there	with	people	from	the	page	that	told	me	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	you	're	going	to	be	in	europe	,	i	'm	coming	.	i	'm	coming	from	france	,	from	holland	,	from	germany	,	``	of	course	,	and	from	israel	people	came	,	and	we	just	met	there	for	the	first	time	in	real	life	.
i	met	with	people	that	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	my	 ene 	 mies 	 	for	the	first	time	.	and	we	just	shake	 hand 	 s 	 	,	and	have	a	coffee	and	a	nice	 discuss 	 ion 	 	,	and	we	talk	about	food	and	 basket 	 ball 	 	.
and	that	was	the	end	of	it	.
remember	that	image	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	?
at	some	point	we	met	in	real	life	,	and	we	 be 	 came 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	the	other	way	around	.
some	girl	that	we	met	on	facebook	never	 be 	 en 	 	in	israel	,	born	and	raised	in	iran	,	 live 	 s 	 	in	germany	,	 af 	 raid 	 	of	israelis	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	she	 know 	 s 	 	about	us	,	 decide 	 s 	 	after	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	with	some	israelis	to	come	to	israel	,	and	she	 get 	 s 	 	on	the	plane	and	 arriv 	 es 	 	at	ben	gurion	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	not	that	big	a	deal	.	``
so	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	stress	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 high 	 er 	 	,	so	we	start	 th 	 is 	 	new	campaign	 call 	 ed 	 	``	not	ready	to	die	in	your	war	.	``
i	mean	,	it	's	plus	/	minus	the	same	 mess 	 age 	 	,	but	we	 want 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	to	add	some	 aggress 	 ivity 	 	to	it	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	did	n't	have	on	the	first	wave	of	the	campaign	.
now	people	from	iran	,	the	same	 one 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 hy 	 	at	the	first	campaign	and	just	 s 	 ent 	 	,	you	know	,	 the 	 ir 	 	foot	and	half	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	now	they	're	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	no	problem	,	we	're	 in 	 to 	 	it	.	we	are	with	you	.	``
just	read	where	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	are	from	.
and	for	every	guy	from	israel	,	you	've	got	 some 	 one 	 	from	iran	.
just	people	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	.
crazy	,	 y 	 es 	 	?
so	--	so	you	may	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	 du 	 de 	 	?
my	name	is	ronny	edry	,	and	i	'm	41	,	i	'm	an	israeli	,	i	'm	a	father	of	two	,	i	'm	a	husband	,	and	i	'm	a	graphic	 design 	 er 	 	.	i	'm	 teach 	 ing 	 	graphic	design	.
and	i	'm	not	that	naive	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	lot	of	the	time	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	naive	,	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 flower 	 s 	 	over	,	i	mean	--	``	i	was	in	the	 arm 	 y 	 	.	i	was	in	the	 para 	 troop 	 ers 	 	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	know	how	it	 look 	 s 	 	from	the	ground	.
i	know	how	it	can	look	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	.
so	to	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 courage 	 ous 	 	thing	to	do	,	to	try	to	reach	the	other	side	before	it	's	too	late	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	it	's	going	to	be	too	late	,	it	's	going	to	be	too	late	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	war	is	 inevit 	 able 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	[	with	]	effort	,	we	can	avoid	it	.
 may 	 be 	 	 a 	 s 	 	people	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	israel	,	we	're	in	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.	we	have	the	 free 	 dom 	 	of	speech	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	that	little	thing	can	change	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	we	can	be	our	own	 ambassador 	 s 	 	.
we	can	just	 s 	 end 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	and	hope	for	the	best	.
so	i	want	to	ask	michal	,	my	wife	,	to	come	with	me	on	the	stage	just	to	make	with	you	one	image	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	all	about	 image 	 s 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	that	image	will	help	us	change	 some 	 thing 	 	.
just	raise	that	.	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	'm	just	going	to	take	a	picture	of	it	,	and	i	'm	just	going	to	post	it	on	facebook	with	kind	of	``	israelis	for	peace	``	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
oh	my	god	.
do	n't	cry	.
thank	you	 guy 	 s 	 	.
