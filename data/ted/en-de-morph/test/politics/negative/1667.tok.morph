radical	 open 	 ness 	 	is	still	a	 di 	 stant 	 	future	in	the	field	of	school	education	.
we	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	hard	time	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	that	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	not	a	place	but	an	activity	.
but	i	want	to	tell	you	the	story	of	pisa	,	oecd	's	test	to	measure	the	knowledge	and	 skill 	 s 	 	of	15	-	year	-	olds	around	the	world	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	story	of	how	 inter 	 national 	 	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	have	 global 	 ized 	 	the	field	of	education	that	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	treat	 a 	 s 	 	an	 af 	 fair 	 	of	domestic	policy	.
look	at	how	the	world	 look 	 ed 	 	in	the	1960s	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	proportion	of	people	who	had	 complete 	 d 	 	high	school	.
you	can	see	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	 every 	 one 	 	else	,	and	much	of	the	economic	success	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 draw 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	long	-	 stand 	 ing 	 	advantage	 a 	 s 	 	the	first	 m 	 over 	 	in	education	.
but	in	the	1970s	,	some	 count 	 ries 	 	caught	up	.
in	the	1980s	,	the	global	expansion	of	the	talent	pool	 continu 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	world	did	n't	stop	in	the	1990s	.
so	in	the	'60s	,	the	u.s.	was	first	.
in	the	'90s	,	it	was	13th	,	and	not	 be 	 cause 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	had	 fall 	 en 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	 ris 	 en 	 	so	much	 fast 	 er 	 	 else 	 where 	 	.
korea	 show 	 s 	 	you	what	's	possible	in	education	.
two	 generation 	 s 	 	ago	,	korea	had	the	standard	of	living	of	afghanistan	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	was	one	of	the	 low 	 est 	 	education	 perform 	 ers 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	every	young	korean	 finish 	 es 	 	high	school	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	,	in	a	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	it	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	national	 improve 	 ment 	 	that	's	the	 bench 	 mark 	 	for	success	,	but	the	best	 perform 	 ing 	 	education	 system 	 s 	 	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	.
the	trouble	is	that	 measur 	 ing 	 	how	much	time	people	 s 	 pend 	 	in	school	or	what	degree	they	have	got	is	not	 al 	 ways 	 	a	good	way	of	 see 	 ing 	 	what	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	.
look	at	the	toxic	mix	of	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	 graduate 	 s 	 	on	our	 street 	 s 	 	,	while	 employ 	 ers 	 	say	they	can	not	find	the	people	with	the	 skill 	 s 	 	they	need	.
and	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	better	 degree 	 s 	 	do	n't	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 transl 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	better	 skill 	 s 	 	and	better	 job 	 s 	 	and	better	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	with	pisa	,	we	try	to	change	 th 	 is 	 	by	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	knowledge	and	 skill 	 s 	 	of	people	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
and	we	took	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	angle	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	less	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 whet 	 her 	 	 student 	 s 	 	can	 simpl 	 y 	 	 re 	 produce 	 	what	they	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	school	,	but	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	test	 whet 	 her 	 	they	can	 extrapol 	 ate 	 	from	what	they	know	and	 app 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	knowledge	in	novel	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
now	,	some	people	have	 critic 	 ized 	 	us	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	say	,	you	know	,	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	of	 measur 	 ing 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	is	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 un 	 fair 	 	to	people	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	test	 student 	 s 	 	with	 problem 	 s 	 	they	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
but	if	you	take	that	logic	,	you	know	,	you	should	consider	life	 un 	 fair 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	test	of	truth	in	life	is	not	 whet 	 her 	 	we	can	remember	what	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	school	,	but	 whet 	 her 	 	we	are	prepared	for	change	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	are	prepared	for	 job 	 s 	 	that	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	,	to	use	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	we	just	ca	n't	 anticip 	 ate 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	once	 hot 	 ly 	 	 contest 	 ed 	 	,	our	way	of	 measur 	 ing 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	the	standard	.
in	our	 lat 	 est 	 	 assess 	 ment 	 	in	2009	,	we	 measur 	 ed 	 	74	school	 system 	 s 	 	that	together	cover	87	percent	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	chart	 show 	 s 	 	you	the	performance	of	 count 	 ries 	 	.
in	red	,	sort	of	 be 	 low 	 	oecd	average	.
yellow	is	so	-	so	,	and	in	green	are	the	 count 	 ries 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
you	can	see	shanghai	,	korea	,	singapore	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	;	finland	in	europe	;	canada	in	north	america	 do 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	that	there	is	a	gap	of	 al 	 most 	 	three	and	a	half	school	 year 	 s 	 	between	15	-	year	-	olds	in	shanghai	and	15	-	year	-	olds	in	chile	,	and	the	gap	 grow 	 s 	 	to	seven	school	 year 	 s 	 	when	you	include	the	 count 	 ries 	 	with	 re 	 ally 	 	poor	performance	.
there	's	a	world	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	way	in	which	young	people	are	prepared	for	 to 	 day 	 	's	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
but	i	want	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	a	second	 import 	 ant 	 	dimension	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
 educ 	 ators 	 	like	to	talk	about	 equ 	 ity 	 	.
with	pisa	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	measure	how	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	deliver	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 en 	 sur 	 ing 	 	that	people	from	different	social	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	have	equal	 chance 	 s 	 	.
and	we	see	that	in	some	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	impact	of	social	 back 	 ground 	 	on	 learn 	 ing 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	.
 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	are	unequally	 distribut 	 ed 	 	.
a	lot	of	potential	of	young	children	is	 waste 	 d 	 	.
we	see	in	other	 count 	 ries 	 	that	it	 matter 	 s 	 	much	less	 in 	 to 	 	which	social	 con 	 text 	 	you	're	born	.
we	all	want	to	be	there	,	in	the	upper	right	 quad 	 rant 	 	,	where	performance	is	strong	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	are	 equal 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	,	and	no	country	,	can	afford	to	be	there	,	where	performance	is	poor	and	there	are	large	social	disparities	.
and	then	we	can	debate	,	you	know	,	is	it	better	to	be	there	,	where	performance	is	strong	at	the	price	of	large	disparities	?
or	do	we	want	to	focus	on	 equ 	 ity 	 	and	accept	 mediocr 	 ity 	 	?
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	look	at	how	 count 	 ries 	 	come	out	on	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	you	see	there	are	a	lot	of	 count 	 ries 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	excellence	with	 equ 	 ity 	 	.
in	fact	,	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 compar 	 ison 	 	is	that	you	do	n't	have	to	 com 	 promise 	 	 equ 	 ity 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	excellence	.
these	 count 	 ries 	 	have	 move 	 d 	 	on	from	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	excellence	for	just	some	to	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	excellence	for	all	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 	.
and	that	 al 	 so 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	the	 paradigm 	 s 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	school	 system 	 s 	 	that	 believ 	 e 	 	they	are	 main 	 ly 	 	there	to	sort	people	.
and	ever	since	 t 	 hose 	 	 result 	 s 	 	came	out	,	 policy 	 makers 	 	,	 educ 	 ators 	 	,	 research 	 ers 	 	from	around	the	world	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	what	's	 be 	 hind 	 	the	success	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
but	let	's	step	back	for	a	moment	and	focus	on	the	 count 	 ries 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	pisa	,	and	i	'm	giving	them	a	 color 	 ed 	 	bubble	now	.
and	i	'm	making	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	bubble	 proportion 	 al 	 	to	the	amount	of	money	that	 count 	 ries 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	on	 student 	 s 	 	.
if	money	would	tell	you	 every 	 thing 	 	about	the	quality	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	,	you	would	find	all	the	large	 bubble 	 s 	 	at	the	top	,	no	?
but	that	's	not	what	you	see	.
 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	per	student	 on 	 ly 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	about	,	well	,	less	than	20	percent	of	the	performance	 vari 	 ation 	 	among	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	luxembourg	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	most	expensive	system	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	well	.
what	you	see	is	that	two	 count 	 ries 	 	with	similar	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 result 	 s 	 	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	see	--	and	i	think	that	's	one	of	the	most	 encourag 	 ing 	 	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	that	we	no	 long 	 er 	 	live	in	a	world	that	is	 neat 	 ly 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	between	rich	and	well	-	educated	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	poor	and	 bad 	 ly 	 	-	educated	 one 	 s 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 	.
let	's	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	in	 great 	 er 	 	detail	.
the	red	dot	 show 	 s 	 	you	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	per	student	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	a	country	's	wealth	.
one	way	you	can	 s 	 pend 	 	money	is	by	 pay 	 ing 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	well	,	and	you	can	see	korea	 invest 	 ing 	 	a	lot	in	 attract 	 ing 	 	the	best	people	 in 	 to 	 	the	 teach 	 ing 	 	profession	.
and	korea	 al 	 so 	 	 invest 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	long	school	 day 	 s 	 	,	which	 drive 	 s 	 	up	 cost 	 s 	 	further	.
last	but	not	 l 	 east 	 	,	koreans	want	 the 	 ir 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	teach	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	develop	.
they	invest	in	professional	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	 collabor 	 ation 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
all	that	 cost 	 s 	 	money	.
how	can	korea	afford	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
the	answer	is	,	 student 	 s 	 	in	korea	learn	in	large	 class 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	blue	bar	which	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	down	.
you	go	to	the	next	country	on	the	list	,	luxembourg	,	and	you	can	see	the	red	dot	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	it	is	for	korea	,	so	luxembourg	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	the	same	per	student	 a 	 s 	 	korea	 do 	 es 	 	.
but	,	you	know	,	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 policy 	 makers 	 	in	luxembourg	all	like	small	 class 	 es 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	to	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	small	class	.
so	they	have	 invest 	 ed 	 	all	 the 	 ir 	 	money	 in 	 to 	 	there	,	and	the	blue	bar	,	class	 s 	 ize 	 	,	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	up	.
but	even	luxembourg	can	 s 	 pend 	 	 it 	 s 	 	money	 on 	 ly 	 	once	,	and	the	price	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	not	paid	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	well	.
 student 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	long	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 teacher 	 s 	 	have	little	time	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	else	than	 teach 	 ing 	 	.
so	you	can	see	two	 count 	 ries 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	money	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	how	they	 s 	 pent 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	money	 matter 	 s 	 	a	lot	more	than	how	much	they	invest	in	education	.
let	's	go	back	to	the	year	2000	.
remember	,	that	was	the	year	before	the	ipod	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	world	 look 	 ed 	 	then	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	pisa	performance	.
the	first	thing	you	can	see	is	that	the	 bubble 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	 small 	 er 	 	,	no	?
we	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	less	on	education	,	about	35	percent	less	on	education	.
so	you	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	if	education	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	so	much	more	expensive	,	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 come 	 	so	much	better	?
and	the	bitter	truth	 re 	 ally 	 	is	that	,	you	know	,	not	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	there	are	some	 count 	 ries 	 	which	have	 s 	 een 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	 improve 	 ments 	 	.
germany	,	my	own	country	,	in	the	year	2000	,	 feature 	 d 	 	in	the	lower	 quad 	 rant 	 	,	 be 	 low 	 	average	performance	,	large	social	disparities	.
and	remember	,	germany	,	we	used	to	be	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	 ver 	 y 	 	well	when	you	just	count	people	who	have	 degree 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 disappoint 	 ing 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 stunn 	 ed 	 	by	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
and	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	,	the	public	debate	in	germany	was	 dominate 	 d 	 	for	 month 	 s 	 	by	education	,	not	tax	,	not	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 issue 	 s 	 	,	but	education	was	the	center	of	the	public	debate	.
and	then	 policy 	 makers 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	respond	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	federal	government	 dramat 	 ically 	 	raised	 it 	 s 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	education	.
a	lot	was	 d 	 one 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	life	 chance 	 s 	 	of	 student 	 s 	 	with	an	 im 	 migrant 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	or	from	social	 dis 	 advantage 	 	.
and	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	just	about	 optim 	 izing 	 	 exist 	 ing 	 	 poli 	 cies 	 	,	but	data	 transform 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	 belief 	 s 	 	and	 paradigm 	 s 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	german	education	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	the	education	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	young	children	was	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	business	of	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	and	you	would	have	 case 	 s 	 	where	women	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 neglect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	family	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	when	they	 s 	 ent 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	to	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	.
pisa	 ha 	 s 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	that	debate	,	and	 push 	 ed 	 	early	 child 	 hood 	 	education	right	at	the	center	of	public	policy	in	germany	.
or	 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	the	german	education	 divide 	 s 	 	children	at	the	age	of	10	,	 ver 	 y 	 	young	children	,	between	 t 	 hose 	 	 de 	 em 	 ed 	 	to	pursue	 care 	 ers 	 	of	knowledge	 work 	 ers 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	would	end	up	 work 	 ing 	 	for	the	knowledge	 work 	 ers 	 	,	and	that	 main 	 ly 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 socio 	 economic 	 	lines	,	and	that	paradigm	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	now	too	.
a	lot	of	change	.
and	the	good	news	is	,	nine	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	you	can	see	 improve 	 ments 	 	in	quality	and	 equ 	 ity 	 	.
people	have	taken	up	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
or	take	korea	,	at	the	other	end	of	the	spectrum	.
in	the	year	2000	,	korea	did	 al 	 ready 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	but	the	koreans	 we 	 re 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	that	 on 	 ly 	 	a	small	share	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 student 	 s 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	the	 re 	 ally 	 	high	 level 	 s 	 	of	excellence	.
they	took	up	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	and	korea	was	able	to	double	the	proportion	of	 student 	 s 	 	 achiev 	 ing 	 	excellence	in	one	decade	in	the	field	of	 read 	 ing 	 	.
well	,	if	you	 on 	 ly 	 	focus	on	your	 bright 	 est 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	you	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	disparities	grow	,	and	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	bubble	moving	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	to	the	other	direction	,	but	still	,	an	 impress 	 ive 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	.
a	major	 over 	 haul 	 	of	poland	's	education	 help 	 ed 	 	to	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	between	 vari 	 ability 	 	among	 school 	 s 	 	,	turn	around	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 low 	 est 	 	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	raise	performance	by	over	half	a	school	year	.
and	you	can	see	other	 count 	 ries 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
portugal	was	able	to	consolidate	 it 	 s 	 	 fragment 	 ed 	 	school	system	,	raise	quality	and	improve	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	and	so	did	hungary	.
so	what	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	of	change	.
and	even	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	complain	and	say	that	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	like	pisa	is	just	an	artifact	of	culture	,	of	economic	 factor 	 s 	 	,	of	social	 issue 	 s 	 	,	of	 homogen 	 e 	 ity 	 	of	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	and	so	on	,	these	people	must	now	concede	that	education	 improve 	 ment 	 	is	possible	.
you	know	,	poland	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	culture	.
it	did	n't	change	 it 	 s 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.	it	did	n't	change	the	 com 	 position 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	population	.
it	did	n't	fire	 it 	 s 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	.	it	 change 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	education	 poli 	 cies 	 	and	practice	.	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	.
and	all	that	 raise 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	the	question	:	what	can	we	learn	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	green	 quad 	 rant 	 	who	have	 achiev 	 ed 	 	high	 level 	 s 	 	of	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	high	 level 	 s 	 	of	performance	,	and	raised	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	?
and	,	of	course	,	the	question	is	,	can	what	 work 	 s 	 	in	one	 con 	 text 	 	provide	a	model	 else 	 where 	 	?
of	course	,	you	ca	n't	copy	and	paste	education	 system 	 s 	 	 whole 	 sale 	 	,	but	these	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	have	identified	a	range	of	 factor 	 s 	 	that	high	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	share	.
 every 	 body 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	that	education	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	.
but	the	test	of	truth	is	,	how	do	you	weigh	that	 prior 	 ity 	 	against	other	 prior 	 ities 	 	?
how	do	 count 	 ries 	 	pay	 the 	 ir 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	other	 high 	 ly 	 	 skill 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	?
would	you	want	your	child	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	teacher	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	lawyer	?
how	do	the	media	talk	about	 school 	 s 	 	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	?
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	critical	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	what	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	pisa	is	that	,	in	high	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	education	 system 	 s 	 	,	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	have	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	to	make	 choice 	 s 	 	that	value	education	,	 the 	 ir 	 	future	,	more	than	consumption	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	you	know	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	?	you	wo	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	but	there	are	 count 	 ries 	 	in	which	the	most	 attract 	 ive 	 	place	to	be	is	not	the	 shop 	 ping 	 	center	but	the	school	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	exist	.
but	placing	a	high	value	on	education	is	just	part	of	the	picture	.
the	other	part	is	the	belief	that	all	children	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	success	.
you	have	some	 count 	 ries 	 	where	 student 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	early	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 age 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	 student 	 s 	 	are	 divid 	 ed 	 	up	,	 reflect 	 ing 	 	the	belief	that	 on 	 ly 	 	some	children	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	world	-	class	 standard 	 s 	 	.
but	 usual 	 ly 	 	that	is	linked	to	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	social	disparities	.
if	you	go	to	japan	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	or	finland	in	europe	,	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	expect	every	student	to	succeed	,	and	you	can	see	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	mirrored	in	student	behavior	.
when	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 student 	 s 	 	what	 count 	 s 	 	for	success	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	 student 	 s 	 	in	north	america	would	 typical 	 ly 	 	tell	us	,	you	know	,	it	's	all	about	talent	.
if	i	'm	not	born	 a 	 s 	 	a	 gen 	 ius 	 	in	math	,	i	'd	better	 stud 	 y 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
nine	out	of	10	japanese	 student 	 s 	 	say	that	it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	my	own	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	on	my	own	effort	,	and	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	a	lot	about	the	system	that	is	around	them	.
in	the	past	,	different	 student 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	taught	in	similar	ways	.
high	 perform 	 ers 	 	on	pisa	embrace	 divers 	 ity 	 	with	 different 	 iated 	 	 ped 	 ago 	 gical 	 	 practice 	 s 	 	.

high	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	share	clear	and	 ambit 	 ious 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	spectrum	.
every	student	 know 	 s 	 	what	 matter 	 s 	 	.
every	student	 know 	 s 	 	what	's	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	.
and	 no 	 where 	 	 do 	 es 	 	the	quality	of	an	education	system	exceed	the	quality	of	 it 	 s 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
high	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	in	how	they	recruit	and	select	 the 	 ir 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	how	they	train	them	.
they	watch	how	they	improve	the	 performance 	 s 	 	of	 teacher 	 s 	 	in	 difficult 	 ies 	 	who	are	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	,	and	how	they	structure	teacher	pay	.
they	provide	an	environment	 al 	 so 	 	in	which	 teacher 	 s 	 	work	together	to	frame	good	practice	.
and	they	provide	intelligent	 path 	 ways 	 	for	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	grow	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 care 	 ers 	 	.
in	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	school	 system 	 s 	 	,	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	often	left	 al 	 one 	 	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	with	a	lot	of	prescription	on	what	they	should	be	 teach 	 ing 	 	.
high	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	what	good	performance	is	.
they	set	 ver 	 y 	 	 ambit 	 ious 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	,	but	then	they	 en 	 able 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	figure	out	,	what	do	i	need	to	teach	to	my	 student 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?
the	past	was	about	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	in	education	.
now	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	to	 en 	 able 	 	user	-	generated	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
high	 perform 	 ers 	 	have	 move 	 d 	 	on	from	professional	or	from	 administr 	 ative 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 account 	 ability 	 	and	control	--	sort	of	,	how	do	you	check	 whet 	 her 	 	people	do	what	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	in	education	--	to	professional	 form 	 s 	 	of	work	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
they	 en 	 able 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	make	 innov 	 ations 	 	in	 ped 	 ago 	 gy 	 	.
they	provide	them	with	the	kind	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	they	need	to	develop	 strong 	 er 	 	 ped 	 ago 	 gical 	 	 practice 	 s 	 	.
the	goal	of	the	past	was	 standard 	 ization 	 	and	compliance	.
high	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	have	made	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	school	 principal 	 s 	 	 invent 	 ive 	 	.
in	the	past	,	the	policy	focus	was	on	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	,	on	 pro 	 vision 	 	.
the	high	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	have	 help 	 ed 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	school	 principal 	 s 	 	to	look	 out 	 ward 	 s 	 	to	the	next	teacher	,	the	next	school	around	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	the	most	 impress 	 ive 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	of	world	-	class	 system 	 s 	 	is	that	they	 achiev 	 e 	 	high	performance	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	system	.
you	've	 s 	 een 	 	finland	 do 	 ing 	 	so	well	on	pisa	,	but	what	 make 	 s 	 	finland	so	 impress 	 ive 	 	is	that	 on 	 ly 	 	five	percent	of	the	performance	 vari 	 ation 	 	 among 	 st 	 	 student 	 s 	 	lies	between	 school 	 s 	 	.
every	school	 succeed 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	success	is	 system 	 ic 	 	.
and	how	do	they	do	that	?
they	invest	 resource 	 s 	 	where	they	can	make	the	most	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
they	attract	the	 strong 	 est 	 	 principal 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 tough 	 est 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	the	most	 talent 	 ed 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	most	 challeng 	 ing 	 	 class 	 room 	 	.
last	but	not	 l 	 east 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	align	 poli 	 cies 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	all	 area 	 s 	 	of	public	policy	.
they	make	them	 cohere 	 nt 	 	over	 sustain 	 ed 	 	 period 	 s 	 	of	time	,	and	they	ensure	that	what	they	do	is	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	 implement 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	 know 	 ing 	 	what	 success 	 ful 	 	 system 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	yet	tell	us	how	to	improve	.
that	's	 al 	 so 	 	clear	,	and	that	's	where	some	of	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	 inter 	 national 	 	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	of	pisa	are	.
that	's	where	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	research	need	to	kick	in	,	and	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	why	pisa	 do 	 es 	 	n't	venture	 in 	 to 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	what	they	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	.
but	 it 	 s 	 	strength	lies	in	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	what	 every 	 body 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	pisa	 show 	 s 	 	that	data	can	be	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	 administr 	 ative 	 	control	of	financial	 sub 	 s 	 idy 	 	through	which	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	run	education	 system 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	some	people	 argu 	 e 	 	that	changing	 education 	 al 	 	 administr 	 ation 	 	is	like	moving	graveyards	.
you	just	ca	n't	 re 	 ly 	 	on	the	people	out	there	to	help	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	pisa	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	what	's	possible	in	education	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	to	see	that	 improve 	 ment 	 	is	possible	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	away	 excuse 	 s 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 com 	 place 	 nt 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	to	set	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 target 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 measur 	 able 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	by	the	world	's	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
if	we	can	help	every	child	,	every	teacher	,	every	school	,	every	principal	,	every	parent	see	what	 improve 	 ment 	 	is	possible	,	that	 on 	 ly 	 	the	sky	is	the	limit	to	education	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	we	have	laid	the	 found 	 ations 	 	for	better	 poli 	 cies 	 	and	better	 live 	 s 	 	.
