the	global	economic	financial	crisis	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ignit 	 ed 	 	public	interest	in	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 old 	 est 	 	 question 	 s 	 	in	 economic 	 s 	 	,	 d 	 ating 	 	back	to	at	 l 	 east 	 	before	adam	smith	.
and	that	is	,	why	is	it	that	 count 	 ries 	 	with	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	similar	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	and	 institution 	 s 	 	can	 dis 	 play 	 	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	 saving 	 s 	 	behavior	?
now	,	 man 	 y 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 economist 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 pent 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	 live 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	field	we	've	made	a	tremendous	amount	of	headway	and	we	understand	a	lot	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	i	'm	here	to	talk	with	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	an	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	new	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	and	some	 surprising 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	new	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	about	the	link	between	the	structure	of	the	language	you	speak	and	how	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	with	the	 prop 	 en 	 s 	 ity 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	 saving 	 s 	 	rates	,	a	little	bit	about	language	,	and	then	i	'll	draw	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
let	's	start	by	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	member	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	oecd	,	or	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	of	economic	 co 	 operation 	 	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
oecd	 count 	 ries 	 	,	by	and	large	,	you	should	think	about	these	 a 	 s 	 	the	 rich 	 est 	 	,	most	 industrial 	 ized 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	.
and	by	 join 	 ing 	 	the	oecd	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 affirm 	 ing 	 	a	common	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	open	 market 	 s 	 	and	free	trade	.
 de 	 spite 	 	all	of	these	 similar 	 ities 	 	,	we	see	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 saving 	 s 	 	behavior	.
so	all	the	way	over	on	the	left	of	 th 	 is 	 	graph	,	what	you	see	is	 man 	 y 	 	oecd	 count 	 ries 	 	saving	over	a	quarter	of	 the 	 ir 	 	gdp	every	year	,	and	some	oecd	 count 	 ries 	 	saving	over	a	third	of	 the 	 ir 	 	gdp	per	year	.
 hold 	 ing 	 	down	the	right	flank	of	the	oecd	,	all	the	way	on	the	other	side	,	is	greece	.
and	what	you	can	see	is	that	over	the	last	25	 year 	 s 	 	,	greece	 ha 	 s 	 	 bare 	 ly 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	more	than	10	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	gdp	.
it	should	be	 not 	 ed 	 	,	of	course	,	that	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	u.k.	are	the	next	in	line	.
now	that	we	see	these	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 saving 	 s 	 	rates	,	how	is	it	possible	that	language	might	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	these	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	?
let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	how	 language 	 s 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	differ	.
 linguist 	 s 	 	and	cognitive	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
and	then	i	'll	draw	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	these	two	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 prob 	 ably 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	that	i	'm	chinese	.
i	grew	up	in	the	 mid 	 west 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	early	on	was	that	the	chinese	language	 force 	 d 	 	me	to	speak	about	and	--	in	fact	,	more	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	than	that	--	ever	so	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 force 	 d 	 	me	to	think	about	family	in	 ver 	 y 	 	different	ways	.
now	,	how	might	that	be	?	let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
suppose	i	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	you	and	i	was	 introduc 	 ing 	 	you	to	my	uncle	.
you	 under 	 stood 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	just	 s 	 aid 	 	in	english	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	mandarin	chinese	with	each	other	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	would	n't	have	that	 luxur 	 y 	 	.
i	would	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	convey	so	little	information	.
what	my	language	would	have	 force 	 d 	 	me	to	do	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	uncle	,	``	is	to	tell	you	a	tremendous	amount	of	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	information	.
my	language	would	force	me	to	tell	you	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	uncle	on	my	mother	's	side	or	my	father	's	side	,	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	uncle	by	marriage	or	by	birth	,	and	if	 th 	 is 	 	man	was	my	father	's	brother	,	 whet 	 her 	 	he	was	 old 	 er 	 	than	or	 young 	 er 	 	than	my	father	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	information	is	 oblig 	 atory 	 	.	chinese	 do 	 es 	 	n't	let	me	 ignor 	 e 	 	it	.
and	in	fact	,	if	i	want	to	speak	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	chinese	 force 	 s 	 	me	to	 constant 	 ly 	 	think	about	it	.
now	,	that	 fascinate 	 d 	 	me	 end 	 lessly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	but	what	 fascinate 	 s 	 	me	even	more	 to 	 day 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	economist	is	that	some	of	these	same	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	carry	through	to	how	 language 	 s 	 	speak	about	time	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	i	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	in	english	,	i	have	to	speak	 grammatical 	 ly 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	if	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	past	rain	,	``	it	 rain 	 ed 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	,	``	current	rain	,	``	it	is	 rain 	 ing 	 	now	,	``	or	future	rain	,	``	it	will	rain	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.	``
notice	that	english	 requir 	 es 	 	a	lot	more	information	with	respect	to	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	of	 event 	 s 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	to	consider	that	and	i	have	to	modify	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	``	it	will	rain	,	``	or	``	it	's	going	to	rain	.	``
it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	 per 	 mis 	 s 	 ible 	 	in	english	to	say	,	``	it	rain	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.	``
in	contrast	to	that	,	that	's	 al 	 most 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	would	say	in	chinese	.
a	chinese	speaker	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	say	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	to	an	english	speaker	's	 ear 	 s 	 	.
they	can	say	,	``	 yester 	 day 	 	it	rain	,	``	``	now	it	rain	,	``	``	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	it	rain	.	``
in	some	deep	sense	,	chinese	 do 	 es 	 	n't	divide	up	the	time	spectrum	in	the	same	way	that	english	 force 	 s 	 	us	to	 constant 	 ly 	 	do	in	order	to	speak	 correct 	 ly 	 	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 language 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	between	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 di 	 stant 	 ly 	 	related	 language 	 s 	 	,	like	english	and	chinese	?
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	no	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	that	english	is	a	germanic	language	.
what	you	may	not	have	 real 	 ized 	 	is	that	english	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	outlier	.
it	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	germanic	language	that	 requir 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	most	other	germanic	language	 speaker 	 s 	 	feel	 complete 	 ly 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	rain	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	morgen	regnet	es	,	``	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	to	an	english	ear	,	``	it	rain	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	led	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 behavior 	 al 	 	economist	,	to	an	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	.
could	how	you	speak	about	time	,	could	how	your	language	 force 	 s 	 	you	to	think	about	time	,	affect	your	 prop 	 en 	 s 	 ity 	 	to	 behav 	 e 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	time	?
you	speak	english	,	a	futured	language	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	every	time	you	discuss	the	future	,	or	any	kind	of	a	future	event	,	 grammatical 	 ly 	 	you	're	 force 	 d 	 	to	cleave	that	from	the	present	and	treat	it	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 visceral 	 ly 	 	different	.
now	suppose	that	that	visceral	 differ 	 ence 	 	 make 	 s 	 	you	 sub 	 t 	 ly 	 	dissociate	the	future	from	the	present	every	time	you	speak	.
if	that	's	true	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	the	future	feel	like	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 di 	 stant 	 	and	more	different	from	the	present	,	that	's	going	to	make	it	 hard 	 er 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	.
if	,	on	the	other	hand	,	you	speak	a	futureless	language	,	the	present	and	the	future	,	you	speak	about	them	identically	.
if	that	 sub 	 t 	 ly 	 	 nudge 	 s 	 	you	to	feel	about	them	identically	,	that	's	going	to	make	it	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fanci 	 ful 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
i	'm	a	professor	,	i	get	paid	to	have	 fanci 	 ful 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	.
but	how	would	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	about	 test 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 theor 	 y 	 	?
well	,	what	i	did	with	that	was	to	access	the	 linguist 	 ic 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
and	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	there	are	 pocket 	 s 	 	of	futureless	language	 speaker 	 s 	 	 situ 	 ated 	 	all	over	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	pocket	of	futureless	language	 speaker 	 s 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	europe	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	when	you	start	to	crank	the	data	,	these	 pocket 	 s 	 	of	futureless	language	 speaker 	 s 	 	all	around	the	world	turn	out	to	be	,	by	and	large	,	some	of	the	world	's	best	 saver 	 s 	 	.
just	to	give	you	a	hint	of	that	,	let	's	look	back	at	that	oecd	graph	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
what	you	see	is	that	these	 bar 	 s 	 	are	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	 tall 	 er 	 	and	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	 shift 	 ed 	 	to	the	left	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	these	 bar 	 s 	 	which	are	the	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	oecd	that	speak	futured	 language 	 s 	 	.
what	is	the	average	 differ 	 ence 	 	here	?
five	 percent 	 age 	 	 point 	 s 	 	of	your	gdp	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	per	year	.
over	25	 year 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	long	-	run	 effect 	 s 	 	on	the	wealth	of	your	nation	.
now	while	these	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 suggest 	 ive 	 	,	 count 	 ries 	 	can	be	different	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	ways	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	to	account	for	all	of	these	possible	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	for	a	year	,	which	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	gather	all	of	the	largest	datasets	that	we	have	access	to	 a 	 s 	 	 economist 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	try	and	strip	away	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	possible	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	relationship	to	break	.
and	just	in	 summ 	 ary 	 	,	no	matter	how	far	i	push	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	ca	n't	get	it	to	break	.
let	me	show	you	how	far	you	can	do	that	.
one	way	to	imagine	that	is	i	gather	large	datasets	from	around	the	world	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	is	the	survey	of	health	,	[	aging	]	and	 retire 	 ment 	 	in	europe	.
from	 th 	 is 	 	 data 	 set 	 	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	learn	that	 retire 	 d 	 	european	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	patient	with	survey	 taker 	 s 	 	.
so	imagine	that	you	're	a	 retire 	 d 	 	 house 	 hold 	 	in	belgium	and	 some 	 one 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	your	front	door	.
``	excuse	me	,	would	you	mind	if	i	peruse	your	stock	portfolio	?
do	you	happen	to	know	how	much	your	house	is	worth	?	do	you	mind	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	?
would	you	happen	to	have	a	 hall 	 way 	 	that	's	more	than	10	 meter 	 s 	 	long	?
if	you	do	,	would	you	mind	if	i	 time 	 d 	 	how	long	it	took	you	to	walk	down	that	 hall 	 way 	 	?
would	you	mind	 squeez 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	hard	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	,	in	your	 domin 	 ant 	 	hand	,	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	so	i	can	measure	your	grip	strength	?

the	survey	 take 	 s 	 	over	a	day	.
combine	that	with	a	 demo 	 graphic 	 	and	health	survey	 collect 	 ed 	 	by	usaid	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	africa	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	that	survey	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	go	so	far	 a 	 s 	 	to	 direct 	 ly 	 	measure	the	hiv	 stat 	 us 	 	of	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	living	in	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 r 	 ural 	 	nigeria	.
combine	that	with	a	world	value	survey	,	which	 measure 	 s 	 	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 opinion 	 s 	 	and	,	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	for	me	,	the	 saving 	 s 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	in	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	.
take	all	of	that	data	,	combine	it	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	map	is	what	you	get	.
what	you	find	is	nine	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	that	have	significant	native	 population 	 s 	 	which	speak	both	futureless	and	futured	 language 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	form	 statistic 	 al 	 	 match 	 ed 	 	 pair 	 s 	 	between	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	that	are	 near 	 ly 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	on	every	dimension	that	i	can	measure	,	and	then	i	'm	going	to	explore	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	the	link	between	language	and	 saving 	 s 	 	 hold 	 s 	 	even	after	 controll 	 ing 	 	for	all	of	these	 level 	 s 	 	.
what	are	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	we	can	control	for	?
well	i	'm	going	to	match	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	on	country	of	birth	and	residence	,	the	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	--	what	 s 	 ex 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	age	--	 the 	 ir 	 	income	level	 with 	 in 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	country	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 education 	 al 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 	,	a	lot	about	 the 	 ir 	 	family	structure	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	are	six	different	ways	to	be	married	in	europe	.
and	most	granularly	,	i	break	them	down	by	 relig 	 ion 	 	where	there	are	72	 categor 	 ies 	 	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	in	the	world	--	so	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	level	of	 granular 	 ity 	 	.
there	are	1.4	billion	different	ways	that	a	family	can	find	 it 	 self 	 	.
now	 effective 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	from	now	on	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 compar 	 ing 	 	these	 bas 	 ically 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	possible	to	the	thought	experiment	of	 find 	 ing 	 	two	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	both	of	whom	live	in	brussels	who	are	 ident 	 ical 	 	on	every	single	one	of	these	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	but	one	of	whom	 speak 	 s 	 	flemish	and	one	of	whom	 speak 	 s 	 	french	;	or	two	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	that	live	in	a	 r 	 ural 	 	 di 	 strict 	 	in	nigeria	,	one	of	whom	 speak 	 s 	 	hausa	and	one	of	whom	 speak 	 s 	 	igbo	.
now	even	after	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	granular	level	of	control	,	do	futureless	language	 speaker 	 s 	 	seem	to	 s 	 ave 	 	more	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	futureless	language	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	even	after	 th 	 is 	 	level	of	control	,	are	30	percent	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	report	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	in	any	 give 	 n 	 	year	.
 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	have	cumulative	 effect 	 s 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	by	the	time	they	retire	,	futureless	language	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	constant	 the 	 ir 	 	income	,	are	going	to	retire	with	25	percent	more	in	 saving 	 s 	 	.
can	we	push	 th 	 is 	 	data	even	further	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	just	told	you	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	collect	a	lot	of	health	data	 a 	 s 	 	 economist 	 s 	 	.
now	how	can	we	think	about	health	 behavior 	 s 	 	to	think	about	 saving 	 s 	 	?
well	,	think	about	 smok 	 ing 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 smok 	 ing 	 	is	in	some	deep	sense	negative	 saving 	 s 	 	.
if	 saving 	 s 	 	is	current	pain	in	 ex 	 change 	 	for	future	pleasure	,	 smok 	 ing 	 	is	just	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
it	's	current	pleasure	in	 ex 	 change 	 	for	future	pain	.
what	we	should	expect	then	is	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	effect	.
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	find	.
futureless	language	 speaker 	 s 	 	are	20	to	24	percent	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 smok 	 ing 	 	at	any	 give 	 n 	 	point	in	time	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 ident 	 ical 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	and	they	're	going	to	be	13	to	17	percent	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 obes 	 e 	 	by	the	time	they	retire	,	and	they	're	going	to	report	 be 	 ing 	 	21	percent	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	used	a	condom	in	 the 	 ir 	 	last	sexual	 en 	 counter 	 	.
i	could	go	on	and	on	with	the	list	of	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	that	you	can	find	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	not	to	find	a	 saving 	 s 	 	behavior	for	which	 th 	 is 	 	strong	effect	is	n't	present	.
