so	,	people	want	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	out	of	life	,	but	i	think	,	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	else	,	they	want	happiness	.
aristotle	 call 	 ed 	 	happiness	``	the	chief	good	,	``	the	end	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	which	all	other	 thing 	 s 	 	aim	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	view	,	the	reason	we	want	a	big	house	or	a	nice	car	or	a	good	job	is	n't	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	.
it	's	that	we	expect	them	to	 br 	 ing 	 	us	now	in	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	americans	have	gotten	a	lot	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	want	.	we	're	 rich 	 er 	 	.
we	live	 long 	 er 	 	.	we	have	access	to	technology	that	would	have	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	science	fiction	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	paradox	of	happiness	is	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 object 	 ive 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	have	 improv 	 ed 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	,	we	have	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	gotten	any	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 convention 	 al 	 	 not 	 ions 	 	of	progress	have	n't	 deliver 	 ed 	 	big	 benefit 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	happiness	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	interest	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	in	happiness	 it 	 self 	 	.
people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 deb 	 ating 	 	the	 cause 	 s 	 	of	happiness	for	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	time	,	in	fact	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 debate 	 s 	 	remain	 un 	 resolved 	 	.
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	other	 domain 	 s 	 	in	life	,	i	think	the	scientific	method	 ha 	 s 	 	the	potential	to	answer	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
in	fact	,	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	explosion	in	research	on	happiness	.	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	 it 	 s 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	,	how	 thing 	 s 	 	like	income	and	education	,	gender	and	marriage	 re 	 late 	 	to	it	.
but	one	of	the	 puzzl 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	is	that	 factor 	 s 	 	like	these	do	n't	seem	to	have	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	strong	effect	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	better	to	make	more	money	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	less	,	or	to	graduate	from	college	 in 	 stead 	 	of	dropping	out	,	but	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	happiness	tend	to	be	small	.
which	 leav 	 es 	 	the	question	,	what	are	the	big	 cause 	 s 	 	of	happiness	?
i	think	that	's	a	question	we	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 answer 	 ed 	 	yet	,	but	i	think	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	potential	to	be	an	answer	is	that	 may 	 be 	 	happiness	 ha 	 s 	 	an	awful	lot	to	do	with	the	 content 	 s 	 	of	our	moment	-	to	-	moment	 experience 	 s 	 	.
it	 certain 	 ly 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	that	we	're	going	about	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	that	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	who	we	're	with	,	what	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	have	a	big	influence	on	our	happiness	,	and	yet	these	are	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	,	in	fact	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	,	for	 scientist 	 s 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	came	up	with	a	way	to	 stud 	 y 	 	people	's	happiness	moment	to	moment	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	going	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	on	a	massive	scale	all	over	the	world	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	'd	never	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	before	.	 call 	 ed 	 	 track 	 your 	 happiness 	 .org 	 	,	it	uses	the	iphone	to	monitor	people	's	happiness	in	real	time	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	?	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	 s 	 end 	 	people	 signal 	 s 	 	at	random	 point 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	day	,	and	then	i	ask	them	a	bunch	of	 question 	 s 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	moment	-	to	-	moment	experience	at	the	instant	just	before	the	signal	.
the	idea	is	that	,	if	we	can	watch	how	people	's	happiness	 go 	 es 	 	up	and	down	over	the	course	of	the	day	,	minute	to	minute	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	and	try	to	understand	how	what	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	who	they	're	with	,	what	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	and	all	the	other	 factor 	 s 	 	that	 de 	 scribe 	 	our	day	,	how	 t 	 hose 	 	might	 re 	 late 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	happiness	,	we	might	be	able	to	discover	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	big	influence	on	happiness	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	fortunate	with	 th 	 is 	 	project	to	collect	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	data	,	a	lot	more	data	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	than	i	think	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	before	,	over	650,000	real	-	time	 report 	 s 	 	from	over	15,000	people	.
and	it	's	not	just	a	lot	of	people	,	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	group	,	people	from	a	wide	range	of	 age 	 s 	 	,	from	18	to	late	80s	,	a	wide	range	of	 income 	 s 	 	,	education	 level 	 s 	 	,	people	who	are	married	,	 divorce 	 d 	 	,	 widow 	 ed 	 	,	etc	.
they	 collect 	 ively 	 	represent	every	one	of	86	 occupation 	 al 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	and	hail	from	over	80	 count 	 ries 	 	.
what	i	'd	like	to	do	with	the	rest	of	my	time	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	talk	a	little	bit	about	one	of	the	 area 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	,	and	that	's	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	ability	to	have	our	 mind 	 s 	 	 s 	 tray 	 	away	from	the	present	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	 work 	 ing 	 	on	his	computer	,	and	yet	he	could	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 vac 	 ation 	 	he	had	last	month	,	 wonder 	 ing 	 	what	he	's	going	to	have	for	 d 	 inner 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	he	's	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	he	's	going	bald	.
 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	focus	our	attention	on	 some 	 thing 	 	other	than	the	present	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	learn	and	plan	and	reason	in	ways	that	no	other	species	of	animal	can	.
and	yet	it	's	not	clear	what	the	relationship	is	between	our	use	of	 th 	 is 	 	ability	and	our	happiness	.
you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	people	suggest	that	you	should	stay	focused	on	the	present	.	``	be	here	now	,	``	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	a	hundred	 time 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	be	happy	,	we	need	to	stay	 complete 	 ly 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	and	focused	on	our	experience	in	the	moment	.
 may 	 be 	 	these	people	are	right	.	 may 	 be 	 	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	is	a	bad	thing	.
on	the	other	hand	,	when	our	 mind 	 s 	 	wander	,	they	're	 un 	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	.	we	ca	n't	change	the	physical	 re 	 ality 	 	in	front	of	us	,	but	we	can	go	 any 	 where 	 	in	our	 mind 	 s 	 	.
since	we	know	people	want	to	be	happy	,	 may 	 be 	 	when	our	 mind 	 s 	 	wander	,	they	're	going	to	 some 	 place 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	than	the	place	that	they	're	 leav 	 ing 	 	.	it	would	make	a	lot	of	sense	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	 pleasure 	 s 	 	of	the	mind	allow	us	to	 in 	 crease 	 	our	happiness	with	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	.
well	,	since	i	'm	a	scientist	,	i	'd	like	to	try	to	 re 	 solve 	 	 th 	 is 	 	debate	with	some	data	,	and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	i	'd	like	to	present	some	data	to	you	from	three	 question 	 s 	 	that	i	ask	with	track	your	happiness	.	remember	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	sort	of	moment	-	to	-	moment	experience	in	people	's	real	 live 	 s 	 	.
there	are	three	 question 	 s 	 	.	the	first	one	is	a	happiness	question	:	how	do	you	feel	,	on	a	scale	ranging	from	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	to	 ver 	 y 	 	good	?	second	,	an	activity	question	:	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	,	on	a	list	of	22	different	 activ 	 ities 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	eating	and	 work 	 ing 	 	and	 watch 	 ing 	 	tv	?
and	 final 	 ly 	 	a	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	question	:	are	you	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	other	than	what	you	're	 current 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	?
people	could	say	no	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	focused	 on 	 ly 	 	on	my	task	--	or	 y 	 es 	 	--	i	am	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	else	--	and	the	 top 	 ic 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	are	 pleas 	 ant 	 	,	neutral	or	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	.
any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 y 	 es 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	are	what	we	 call 	 ed 	 	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	did	we	find	?
 th 	 is 	 	graph	 show 	 s 	 	happiness	on	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	axis	,	and	you	can	see	that	bar	there	 represent 	 ing 	 	how	happy	people	are	when	they	're	focused	on	the	present	,	when	they	're	not	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	people	are	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	less	happy	when	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	are	 wander 	 ing 	 	than	when	they	're	not	.
now	you	might	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	result	and	say	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 	,	on	average	people	are	less	happy	when	they	're	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	,	but	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	when	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 tray 	 ing 	 	away	from	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 enjoy 	 able 	 	to	begin	with	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	then	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	good	for	us	.
nope	.	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	people	are	less	happy	when	they	're	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	no	matter	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	people	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	like	 com 	 mut 	 ing 	 	to	work	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
it	's	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 l 	 east 	 	 enjoy 	 able 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	and	yet	they	are	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	when	they	're	focused	 on 	 ly 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	commute	than	when	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	is	going	off	to	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
so	how	could	 th 	 is 	 	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	?	i	think	part	of	the	reason	,	a	big	part	of	the	reason	,	is	that	when	our	 mind 	 s 	 	wander	,	we	often	think	about	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	are	 enormous 	 ly 	 	less	happy	when	they	do	that	,	our	 worri 	 es 	 	,	our	 anxie 	 ties 	 	,	our	 regret 	 s 	 	,	and	yet	even	when	people	are	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	neutral	,	they	're	still	 consider 	 ably 	 	less	happy	than	when	they	're	not	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
even	when	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	they	would	 de 	 scribe 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	,	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	less	happy	than	when	they	are	n't	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	.
if	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	 s 	 lot 	 	machine	,	it	would	be	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	chance	to	lose	50	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	20	 dollar 	 s 	 	or	one	dollar	.	right	?	you	'd	never	want	to	play	.
so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 suggest 	 ing 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	that	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	 un 	 happiness 	 	,	but	all	i	've	 re 	 ally 	 	 show 	 n 	 	you	is	that	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 correlate 	 d 	 	.
it	's	possible	that	's	the	case	,	but	it	might	 al 	 so 	 	be	the	case	that	when	people	are	 un 	 happy 	 	,	then	they	mind	-	wander	.
 may 	 be 	 	that	's	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	.	how	could	we	ever	 dis 	 entangle 	 	these	two	 possibil 	 ites 	 	?
well	,	one	fact	that	we	can	take	advantage	of	,	i	think	a	fact	you	'll	all	agree	is	true	,	is	that	time	 go 	 es 	 	forward	,	not	 back 	 ward 	 	.	right	?	the	cause	 ha 	 s 	 	to	come	before	the	effect	.
we	're	 luck 	 y 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	data	we	have	 man 	 y 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	from	each	person	,	and	so	we	can	look	and	see	,	 do 	 es 	 	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	tend	to	precede	 un 	 happiness 	 	,	or	 do 	 es 	 	 un 	 happiness 	 	tend	to	precede	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	,	to	get	some	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 caus 	 al 	 	direction	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	there	is	a	strong	relationship	between	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	now	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	a	short	time	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	the	idea	that	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	people	to	be	 un 	 happy 	 	.
in	contrast	,	there	's	no	relationship	between	 be 	 ing 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	now	and	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	a	short	time	 lat 	 er 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	an	actual	cause	,	and	not	 mere 	 ly 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	of	 un 	 happiness 	 	.
a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 like 	 ned 	 	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	to	a	 s 	 lot 	 	machine	you	'd	never	want	to	play	.
well	,	how	often	do	people	's	 mind 	 s 	 	wander	?
 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	they	wander	a	lot	.	in	fact	,	 re 	 ally 	 	a	lot	.
forty	-	seven	percent	of	the	time	,	people	are	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	other	than	what	they	're	 current 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	that	depend	on	what	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	rate	of	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	22	 activ 	 ities 	 	ranging	from	a	high	of	65	percent	--	--	when	people	are	taking	a	shower	,	 brush 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	,	to	50	percent	when	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	,	to	40	percent	when	they	're	 exercis 	 ing 	 	,	all	the	way	down	to	 th 	 is 	 	one	short	bar	on	the	right	that	i	think	some	of	you	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	 laugh 	 ing 	 	at	.
ten	percent	of	the	time	people	's	 mind 	 s 	 	are	 wander 	 ing 	 	when	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	.
but	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	i	think	that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	graph	,	and	that	is	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	with	one	exception	,	no	matter	what	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	're	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	30	percent	of	the	time	,	which	 suggest 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	that	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	is	n't	just	frequent	,	it	's	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	.
it	 pervad 	 es 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	do	.
in	my	talk	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	've	told	you	a	little	bit	about	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	,	a	 vari 	 able 	 	that	i	think	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 fair 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	for	happiness	.
my	hope	is	that	over	time	,	by	 track 	 ing 	 	people	's	moment	-	to	-	moment	happiness	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	in	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	,	we	'll	be	able	to	 un 	 cover 	 	a	lot	of	 import 	 ant 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	of	happiness	,	and	then	in	the	end	,	a	scientific	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	happiness	will	help	us	create	a	future	that	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 rich 	 er 	 	and	 health 	 ier 	 	,	but	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
thank	you	.
