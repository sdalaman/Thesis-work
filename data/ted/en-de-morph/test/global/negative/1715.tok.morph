one	year	ago	,	i	 rent 	 ed 	 	a	car	in	jerusalem	to	go	find	a	man	i	'd	never	met	but	who	had	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	.
i	did	n't	have	a	phone	number	to	call	to	say	i	was	coming	.
i	did	n't	have	an	exact	address	,	but	i	 k 	 new 	 	his	name	,	abed	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	he	lived	in	a	town	of	15,000	,	kfar	kara	,	and	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	,	21	 year 	 s 	 	before	,	just	 out 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	holy	city	,	he	broke	my	neck	.
and	so	,	on	an	overcast	 morn 	 ing 	 	in	january	,	i	headed	north	off	in	a	silver	chevy	to	find	a	man	and	some	peace	.
the	road	 drop 	 ped 	 	and	i	 exit 	 ed 	 	jerusalem	.
i	then	 round 	 ed 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	bend	where	his	blue	truck	,	heavy	with	four	 ton 	 s 	 	of	floor	 tile 	 s 	 	,	had	borne	down	with	great	speed	onto	the	back	left	corner	of	the	minibus	where	i	 s 	 at 	 	.
i	was	then	19	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	'd	grown	five	 inch 	 es 	 	and	 d 	 one 	 	some	20,000	pushups	in	eight	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	the	night	before	the	crash	,	i	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	in	my	new	body	,	 play 	 ing 	 	 basket 	 ball 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	wee	 hour 	 s 	 	of	a	may	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
i	palmed	the	ball	in	my	large	right	hand	,	and	when	that	hand	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	rim	,	i	felt	 invinc 	 ible 	 	.
i	was	off	in	the	bus	to	get	the	pizza	i	'd	won	on	the	court	.
i	did	n't	see	abed	coming	.
from	my	seat	,	i	was	looking	up	at	a	stone	town	on	a	hilltop	,	bright	in	the	noontime	 s 	 un 	 	,	when	from	 be 	 hind 	 	there	was	a	great	bang	,	 a 	 s 	 	loud	and	violent	 a 	 s 	 	a	bomb	.

i	flew	too	,	my	head	 bobb 	 ing 	 	on	broken	 bone 	 s 	 	,	and	when	i	 land 	 ed 	 	,	i	was	a	 quad 	 rip 	 leg 	 ic 	 	.
over	the	coming	 month 	 s 	 	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	breathe	on	my	own	,	then	to	 s 	 it 	 	and	to	stand	and	to	walk	,	but	my	body	was	now	 divid 	 ed 	 	 vert 	 ically 	 	.
i	was	a	hemiplegic	,	and	back	home	in	new	york	,	i	used	a	wheelchair	for	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	all	through	college	.
college	 end 	 ed 	 	and	i	 return 	 ed 	 	to	jerusalem	for	a	year	.
there	i	rose	from	my	chair	for	good	,	i	 lean 	 ed 	 	on	my	 can 	 e 	 	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	back	,	 find 	 ing 	 	all	from	my	fellow	 passenger 	 s 	 	in	the	bus	to	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	the	crash	,	and	when	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	,	i	did	n't	see	a	 blood 	 y 	 	and	unmoving	body	.
i	saw	the	 health 	 y 	 	bulk	of	a	left	deltoid	,	and	i	mourned	that	it	was	lost	,	mourned	all	i	had	not	yet	 d 	 one 	 	,	but	was	now	 im 	 possible 	 	.
it	was	then	i	read	the	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	that	abed	 g 	 ave 	 	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	after	the	crash	,	of	 driv 	 ing 	 	down	the	right	lane	of	a	 high 	 way 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	jerusalem	.
 read 	 ing 	 	his	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	 well 	 ed 	 	with	anger	.
it	was	the	first	time	i	'd	felt	anger	 to 	 ward 	 	 th 	 is 	 	man	,	and	it	came	from	 magic 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	xeroxed	piece	of	paper	,	the	crash	had	not	yet	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
abed	could	still	turn	his	wheel	left	so	that	i	would	see	him	 who 	 osh 	 	by	out	my	window	and	i	would	remain	whole	.
``	be	 care 	 ful 	 	,	abed	,	look	out	.	 s 	 low 	 	down	.	``
but	abed	did	not	 s 	 low 	 	,	and	on	that	xeroxed	piece	of	paper	,	my	neck	 aga 	 in 	 	broke	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	was	left	 with 	 out 	 	anger	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	find	abed	,	and	when	i	 final 	 ly 	 	did	,	he	 respond 	 ed 	 	to	my	hebrew	 hell 	 o 	 	which	 s 	 uch 	 	nonchalance	,	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	he	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 await 	 ing 	 	my	phone	call	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	he	had	.
i	did	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	to	abed	his	prior	 driv 	 ing 	 	record	--	27	 viol 	 ations 	 	by	the	age	of	25	,	the	last	,	his	not	shifting	his	truck	 in 	 to 	 	a	low	gear	on	that	may	day	--	and	i	did	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	my	prior	record	--	the	quadriplegia	and	the	 catheter 	 s 	 	,	the	 in 	 security 	 	and	the	loss	--	and	when	abed	went	on	about	how	hurt	he	was	in	the	crash	,	i	did	n't	say	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	from	the	police	report	that	he	'd	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	serious	 in 	 jury 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	meet	.
abed	 s 	 aid 	 	that	i	should	call	back	in	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	when	i	did	,	and	a	 record 	 ing 	 	told	me	that	his	number	was	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	i	let	abed	and	the	crash	go	.
 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	.
i	 walk 	 ed 	 	with	my	 can 	 e 	 	and	my	ankle	brace	and	a	 back 	 pack 	 	on	 trip 	 s 	 	in	six	 continent 	 s 	 	.
i	 pitch 	 ed 	 	overhand	in	a	 week 	 ly 	 	 soft 	 ball 	 	game	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	central	park	,	and	home	in	new	york	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	journalist	and	an	author	,	 ty 	 ping 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 word 	 s 	 	with	one	finger	.
a	friend	 point 	 ed 	 	out	to	me	that	all	of	my	big	 st 	 ories 	 	mirrored	my	own	,	each	 center 	 ing 	 	on	a	life	that	had	 change 	 d 	 	in	an	instant	,	 ow 	 ing 	 	,	if	not	to	a	crash	,	then	to	an	 inherit 	 ance 	 	,	a	 s 	 wing 	 	of	the	bat	,	a	click	of	the	 shut 	 ter 	 	,	an	arrest	.
each	of	us	had	a	before	and	an	after	.
i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	through	my	lot	after	all	.
still	,	abed	was	far	from	my	mind	,	when	last	year	,	i	 return 	 ed 	 	to	israel	to	write	of	the	crash	,	and	the	book	i	then	wrote	,	``	half	-	life	,	``	was	 near 	 ly 	 	complete	when	i	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	i	still	 want 	 ed 	 	to	meet	abed	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	i	 under 	 stood 	 	why	:	to	hear	 th 	 is 	 	man	say	two	 word 	 s 	 	:	``	i	'm	sorry	.	``
people	 apolog 	 ize 	 	for	less	.
and	so	i	got	a	cop	to	confirm	that	abed	still	lived	 some 	 where 	 	in	his	same	town	,	and	i	was	now	 driv 	 ing 	 	to	it	with	a	 pot 	 ted 	 	yellow	rose	in	the	back	seat	,	when	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 flower 	 s 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	.
but	what	to	get	the	man	who	broke	your	 fuck 	 ing 	 	neck	?
i	 pull 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	town	of	abu	ghosh	,	and	 b 	 ought 	 	a	brick	of	turkish	 de 	 light 	 	:	pistachios	 glu 	 ed 	 	in	rosewater	.	better	.
back	on	 high 	 way 	 	1	,	i	 envision 	 ed 	 	what	awaited	.
abed	would	hug	me	.	abed	would	 s 	 pit 	 	at	me	.
abed	would	say	,	``	i	'm	sorry	.	``
i	then	 beg 	 an 	 	to	wonder	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	had	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	before	,	how	my	life	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	different	had	 th 	 is 	 	man	not	 inju 	 red 	 	me	,	had	my	 gene 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	fed	a	different	 help 	 ing 	 	of	experience	.
who	was	i	?
was	i	who	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	before	the	crash	,	before	 th 	 is 	 	road	 divid 	 ed 	 	my	life	like	the	 s 	 pine 	 	of	an	open	book	?
was	i	what	had	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	me	?
 we 	 re 	 	all	of	us	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	us	,	 d 	 one 	 	for	us	,	the	infidelity	of	a	parent	or	spouse	,	money	 inherit 	 ed 	 	?
 we 	 re 	 	we	 in 	 stead 	 	our	bodies	,	 the 	 ir 	 	inborn	endowments	and	 defici 	 ts 	 	?
it	 seem 	 ed 	 	that	we	could	be	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	 gene 	 s 	 	and	experience	,	but	how	to	 teas 	 e 	 	out	the	one	from	the	other	?
 a 	 s 	 	yeats	put	that	same	universal	question	,	``	o	body	 s 	 way 	 ed 	 	to	music	,	o	brightening	glance	,	how	can	we	know	the	 danc 	 er 	 	from	the	dance	?	``
i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	for	an	hour	when	i	 look 	 ed 	 	in	my	 rear 	 view 	 	mirror	and	saw	my	own	brightening	glance	.
the	light	my	 eye 	 s 	 	had	carried	for	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	blue	.
the	 pre 	 dis 	 position 	 s 	 	and	 impulse 	 s 	 	that	had	 propel 	 led 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	toddler	to	try	and	slip	over	a	boat	 in 	 to 	 	a	chicago	lake	,	that	had	 propel 	 led 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	teen	to	jump	 in 	 to 	 	wild	cape	cod	 ba 	 y 	 	after	a	hurricane	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	saw	in	my	 reflect 	 ion 	 	that	,	had	abed	not	 inju 	 red 	 	me	,	i	would	now	,	in	all	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	,	be	a	doctor	and	a	husband	and	a	father	.
i	would	be	less	 mind 	 ful 	 	of	time	and	of	death	,	and	,	oh	,	i	would	not	be	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	,	would	not	suffer	the	thousand	 s 	 ling 	 s 	 	and	 arrow 	 s 	 	of	my	fortune	.

the	 danc 	 er 	 	and	the	dance	 we 	 re 	 	 hope 	 lessly 	 	 ent 	 win 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	 approach 	 ing 	 	11	when	i	 exit 	 ed 	 	right	 to 	 ward 	 	afula	,	and	 pass 	 ed 	 	a	large	 quar 	 ry 	 	and	was	soon	in	kfar	kara	.
i	felt	a	pang	of	 nerve 	 s 	 	.
but	chopin	was	on	the	radio	,	seven	 beaut 	 iful 	 	mazurkas	,	and	i	 pull 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	lot	by	a	gas	station	to	listen	and	to	calm	.
i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	told	that	in	an	arab	town	,	one	need	 on 	 ly 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	name	of	a	local	and	it	will	be	 recogn 	 ized 	 	.
and	i	was	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	abed	and	 my 	 self 	 	,	 not 	 ing 	 	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	that	i	was	here	in	peace	,	to	the	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	town	,	when	i	met	mohamed	 out 	 side 	 	a	post	 off 	 ice 	 	at	noon	.

you	know	,	it	was	most	often	when	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	people	that	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	where	i	 end 	 ed 	 	and	my	 dis 	 ability 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	,	for	 man 	 y 	 	people	told	me	what	they	told	no	one	else	.

and	one	day	,	after	a	woman	i	met	on	the	street	did	the	same	and	i	 lat 	 er 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	why	,	she	told	me	that	,	best	she	could	tell	,	her	 tear 	 s 	 	had	had	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	my	 be 	 ing 	 	happy	and	strong	,	but	 vulner 	 able 	 	too	.
i	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	her	 word 	 s 	 	.	i	suppose	they	 we 	 re 	 	true	.
i	was	me	,	but	i	was	now	me	 de 	 spite 	 	a	 l 	 imp 	 	,	and	that	,	i	suppose	,	was	what	now	made	me	,	me	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	mohamed	told	me	what	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	he	would	not	have	told	 an 	 other 	 	 strange 	 r 	 	.
he	led	me	to	a	house	of	cream	stucco	,	then	drove	off	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 at 	 	 contempl 	 ating 	 	what	to	say	,	a	woman	 approach 	 ed 	 	in	a	black	shawl	and	black	robe	.
i	 steppe 	 d 	 	from	my	car	and	 s 	 aid 	 	``	shalom	,	``	and	identified	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	she	told	me	that	her	husband	abed	would	be	home	from	work	in	four	 hour 	 s 	 	.
her	hebrew	was	not	good	,	and	she	 lat 	 er 	 	 confess 	 ed 	 	that	she	thought	that	i	had	come	to	install	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
i	drove	off	and	 return 	 ed 	 	at	4:30	,	 thank 	 ful 	 	to	the	minaret	up	the	road	that	 help 	 ed 	 	me	find	my	way	back	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 approach 	 ed 	 	the	front	door	,	abed	saw	me	,	my	 jean 	 s 	 	and	flannel	and	 can 	 e 	 	,	and	i	saw	abed	,	an	average	-	looking	man	of	average	 s 	 ize 	 	.
he	 wo 	 re 	 	black	and	white	:	 slip 	 per 	 s 	 	over	 sock 	 s 	 	,	pilling	 sweat 	 pants 	 	,	a	 pie 	 bald 	 	 sweat 	 er 	 	,	a	 strip 	 ed 	 	ski	cap	 pull 	 ed 	 	down	to	his	 fore 	 head 	 	.
he	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 expect 	 ing 	 	me	.	mohamed	had	 phone 	 d 	 	.
and	so	at	once	,	we	 s 	 hook 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	and	 smil 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	him	my	gift	,	and	he	told	me	i	was	a	guest	in	his	home	,	and	we	 s 	 at 	 	 be 	 side 	 	one	 an 	 other 	 	on	a	fabric	couch	.
it	was	then	that	abed	 resume 	 d 	 	at	once	the	tale	of	woe	he	had	 beg 	 un 	 	over	the	phone	16	 year 	 s 	 	before	.
he	'd	just	had	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	on	his	 eye 	 s 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
he	had	 problem 	 s 	 	with	his	side	and	his	 leg 	 s 	 	too	,	and	,	oh	,	he	'd	lost	his	 tee 	 th 	 	in	the	crash	.
did	i	wish	to	see	him	 re 	 move 	 	them	?
abed	then	rose	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	the	tv	so	that	i	would	n't	be	 al 	 one 	 	when	he	left	the	room	,	and	 return 	 ed 	 	with	polaroids	of	the	crash	and	his	old	driver	's	 licens 	 e 	 	.
``	i	was	 hand 	 some 	 	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	down	at	his	laminated	mug	.
abed	had	 be 	 en 	 	less	 hand 	 some 	 	than	 sub 	 stantial 	 	,	with	thick	black	hair	and	a	full	face	and	a	wide	neck	.
it	was	 th 	 is 	 	youth	who	on	may	16	,	1990	,	had	broken	two	 neck 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	mine	,	and	 bruis 	 ed 	 	one	brain	and	taken	one	life	.
twenty	-	one	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	he	was	now	 th 	 inner 	 	than	his	wife	,	his	skin	 s 	 lack 	 	on	his	face	,	and	looking	at	abed	looking	at	his	young	self	,	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	looking	at	that	photograph	of	my	young	self	after	the	crash	,	and	 recogn 	 ized 	 	his	 long 	 ing 	 	.
``	the	crash	 change 	 d 	 	both	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	.
abed	then	 show 	 ed 	 	me	a	picture	of	his	 mash 	 ed 	 	truck	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	crash	was	the	fault	of	a	bus	driver	in	the	left	lane	who	did	not	let	him	pass	.
i	did	not	want	to	 re 	 cap 	 	the	crash	with	abed	.
i	'd	 hop 	 ed 	 	for	 some 	 thing 	 	 simpl 	 er 	 	:	to	 ex 	 change 	 	a	turkish	dessert	for	two	 word 	 s 	 	and	be	on	my	way	.
and	so	i	did	n't	point	out	that	in	his	own	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	after	the	crash	,	abed	did	not	even	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	bus	driver	.
no	,	i	was	quiet	.	i	was	quiet	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	not	come	for	truth	.
i	had	come	for	remorse	.
and	so	i	now	went	looking	for	remorse	and	threw	truth	under	the	bus	.
``	i	understand	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	the	crash	was	not	your	fault	,	but	 do 	 es 	 	it	make	you	 s 	 ad 	 	that	 other 	 s 	 	 suffer 	 ed 	 	?	``
abed	spoke	three	quick	 word 	 s 	 	.
``	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	 suffer 	 ed 	 	.	``
abed	then	told	me	why	he	'd	 suffer 	 ed 	 	.

and	so	27	 viol 	 ations 	 	--	 driv 	 ing 	 	through	a	red	light	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	at	 excess 	 ive 	 	speed	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	on	the	wrong	side	of	a	 bar 	 rier 	 	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 rid 	 ing 	 	his	 brake 	 s 	 	down	that	hill	--	 reduc 	 ed 	 	to	one	.

it	was	then	i	 under 	 stood 	 	that	abed	would	never	 apolog 	 ize 	 	.
abed	and	i	 s 	 at 	 	with	our	coffee	.
we	'd	 s 	 pent 	 	90	 minute 	 s 	 	together	,	and	he	was	now	known	to	me	.
he	was	not	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	bad	man	or	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	good	man	.
he	was	a	 limit 	 ed 	 	man	who	'd	found	it	 with 	 in 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	be	kind	to	me	.
with	a	nod	to	jewish	custom	,	he	told	me	that	i	should	live	to	be	120	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
but	it	was	hard	for	me	to	 re 	 late 	 	to	one	who	had	so	 complete 	 ly 	 	 wash 	 ed 	 	his	 hand 	 s 	 	of	his	own	calamitous	 do 	 ing 	 	,	to	one	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	life	was	so	 un 	 examine 	 d 	 	that	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	thought	two	people	had	 di 	 ed 	 	in	the	crash	.
there	was	much	i	 wish 	 ed 	 	to	say	to	abed	.
i	 wish 	 ed 	 	to	tell	him	that	,	 we 	 re 	 	he	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	my	 dis 	 ability 	 	,	it	would	be	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	for	people	are	wrong	to	marvel	at	 t 	 hose 	 	like	me	who	 s 	 mile 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	 l 	 imp 	 	.
people	do	n't	know	that	they	have	lived	through	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	that	 problem 	 s 	 	of	the	heart	hit	with	a	force	 great 	 er 	 	than	a	 run 	 away 	 	truck	,	that	 problem 	 s 	 	of	the	mind	are	 great 	 er 	 	still	,	more	injurious	,	than	a	hundred	broken	 neck 	 s 	 	.
i	 wish 	 ed 	 	to	tell	him	that	what	 make 	 s 	 	most	of	us	who	we	are	most	of	all	is	not	our	 mind 	 s 	 	and	not	our	bodies	and	not	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	us	,	but	how	we	respond	to	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	us	.
``	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	wrote	the	psychiatrist	viktor	frankl	,	``	is	the	last	of	the	human	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	:	to	 choos 	 e 	 	one	's	attitude	in	any	 give 	 n 	 	set	of	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.	``
i	 wish 	 ed 	 	to	tell	him	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	paralyzers	and	paralyzees	must	evolve	,	reconcile	to	 re 	 ality 	 	,	but	we	all	must	--	the	aging	and	the	 anx 	 ious 	 	and	the	 divorce 	 d 	 	and	the	 bald 	 ing 	 	and	the	bankrupt	and	 every 	 one 	 	.
i	 wish 	 ed 	 	to	tell	him	that	one	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	to	say	that	a	bad	thing	is	good	,	that	a	crash	is	from	god	and	so	a	crash	is	good	,	a	broken	neck	is	good	.
one	can	say	that	a	bad	thing	 suck 	 s 	 	,	but	that	 th 	 is 	 	natural	world	still	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 glor 	 ies 	 	.
i	 wish 	 ed 	 	to	tell	him	that	,	in	the	end	,	our	 man 	 date 	 	is	clear	:	we	have	to	rise	above	bad	fortune	.
we	have	to	be	in	the	good	and	enjoy	the	good	,	 stud 	 y 	 	and	work	and	adventure	and	 friend 	 ship 	 	--	oh	,	 friend 	 ship 	 	--	and	community	and	love	.
but	most	of	all	,	i	 wish 	 ed 	 	to	tell	him	what	herman	melville	wrote	,	that	``	 tru 	 ly 	 	to	enjoy	 bod 	 ily 	 	 warm 	 th 	 	,	some	small	part	of	you	must	be	cold	,	for	there	is	no	quality	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	that	is	not	what	it	is	 mere 	 ly 	 	by	contrast	.	``
 y 	 es 	 	,	contrast	.
if	you	are	 mind 	 ful 	 	of	what	you	do	not	have	,	you	may	be	 tru 	 ly 	 	 mind 	 ful 	 	of	what	you	do	have	,	and	if	the	 god 	 s 	 	are	kind	,	you	may	 tru 	 ly 	 	enjoy	what	you	have	.
that	is	the	one	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 	gift	you	may	 receiv 	 e 	 	if	you	suffer	in	any	existential	way	.
you	know	death	,	and	so	may	wake	each	 morn 	 ing 	 	 puls 	 ing 	 	with	ready	life	.
some	part	of	you	is	cold	,	and	so	 an 	 other 	 	part	may	 tru 	 ly 	 	enjoy	what	it	is	to	be	warm	,	or	even	to	be	cold	.
when	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	crash	,	i	 steppe 	 d 	 	onto	stone	and	the	 under 	 side 	 	of	my	left	foot	felt	the	flash	of	cold	,	 nerve 	 s 	 	at	last	awake	,	it	was	 exhila 	 rating 	 	,	a	gust	of	snow	.
but	i	did	n't	say	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	abed	.
i	told	him	 on 	 ly 	 	that	he	had	 kill 	 ed 	 	one	man	,	not	two	.
i	told	him	the	name	of	that	man	.
and	then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 good 	 bye 	 	.	``
thank	you	.
 thank 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
