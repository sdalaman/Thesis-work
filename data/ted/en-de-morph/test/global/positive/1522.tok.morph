 th 	 is 	 	man	is	 wear 	 ing 	 	what	we	call	a	bee	beard	.
a	beard	full	of	bees	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	might	picture	when	you	think	about	 honey 	 bees 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	more	 leg 	 s 	 	than	two	.
and	let	me	start	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	i	gotcha	.
i	understand	that	.	but	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	know	,	and	i	want	you	to	open	your	 mind 	 s 	 	here	,	keep	them	open	,	and	change	your	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	about	 honey 	 bees 	 	.
notice	that	 th 	 is 	 	man	is	not	 get 	 ting 	 	stung	.
he	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 que 	 en 	 	bee	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	his	chin	,	and	the	other	bees	are	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 demonst 	 rates 	 	our	relationship	with	 honey 	 bees 	 	,	and	that	 go 	 es 	 	deep	back	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	co	-	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	depend	on	bees	for	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	and	,	even	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	economic	 commodit 	 y 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	have	heard	that	 honey 	 bees 	 	are	 disappear 	 ing 	 	,	not	just	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	but	they	're	gone	.
we	do	n't	even	find	dead	bodies	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 colon 	 y 	 	collapse	 dis 	 order 	 	,	and	it	's	bizarre	.	 research 	 ers 	 	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	still	do	not	know	what	's	 caus 	 ing 	 	it	,	but	what	we	do	know	is	that	,	with	the	 dec 	 lining 	 	 number 	 s 	 	of	bees	,	the	 cost 	 s 	 	of	over	130	fruit	and	 veget 	 able 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	that	we	 re 	 ly 	 	on	for	food	is	going	up	in	price	.
so	 honey 	 bees 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	role	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
here	you	can	see	some	 picture 	 s 	 	of	what	are	 call 	 ed 	 	green	 roof 	 s 	 	,	or	urban	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
we	're	familiar	with	the	image	on	the	left	that	 show 	 s 	 	a	local	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	garden	in	the	south	end	.
that	's	where	i	call	home	.	i	have	a	 bee 	 hive 	 	in	the	 back 	 yard 	 	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	green	roof	in	the	future	,	when	we	're	further	 util 	 izing 	 	urban	 area 	 s 	 	,	where	there	are	 stack 	 s 	 	of	garden	 space 	 s 	 	.
check	out	 th 	 is 	 	image	above	the	 o 	 range 	 	line	in	boston	.
try	to	spot	the	 bee 	 hive 	 	.	it	's	there	.
it	's	on	the	 roof 	 top 	 	,	right	on	the	corner	there	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	there	for	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
the	way	that	urban	 beekee 	 ping 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	 oper 	 ates 	 	is	that	the	 bee 	 hive 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	,	and	it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	they	need	to	be	.
it	's	just	 be 	 cause 	 	people	are	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	the	idea	,	and	that	's	why	i	want	you	 to 	 day 	 	to	try	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	think	about	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	bees	in	cities	and	why	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	thing	.
let	me	give	you	a	brief	rundown	on	how	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	we	know	 flower 	 s 	 	,	we	know	 fruit 	 s 	 	and	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	,	even	some	alfalfa	in	hay	that	the	 live 	 stock 	 	for	the	 meat 	 s 	 	that	we	eat	,	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	,	but	you	've	got	male	and	female	 part 	 s 	 	to	a	plant	here	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	are	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	 plant 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	nectar	,	and	in	the	process	,	a	bee	will	visit	some	 flower 	 s 	 	and	pick	up	some	 poll 	 en 	 	,	or	that	male	kind	of	 s 	 perm 	 	 counter 	 part 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	,	and	then	travel	to	different	 flower 	 s 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	an	apple	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	will	be	 produce 	 d 	 	.
you	can	see	the	 orient 	 ation 	 	.	the	stem	is	down	.
the	blossom	end	 ha 	 s 	 	 fall 	 en 	 	off	by	the	time	we	eat	it	,	but	that	's	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	 over 	 view 	 	of	how	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	let	's	think	about	urban	living	,	not	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	not	in	the	past	,	but	what	about	in	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	?
what	's	it	gon	na	look	like	?	we	have	huge	grand	 challeng 	 es 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	of	 habit 	 at 	 	loss	.	we	have	more	and	more	people	,	 billion 	 s 	 	of	people	,	in	100	 year 	 s 	 	,	god	 know 	 s 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	and	how	little	space	there	will	be	to	fit	all	of	them	,	so	we	need	to	change	the	way	that	we	see	cities	,	and	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	picture	on	the	left	of	new	york	city	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	can	see	how	gray	and	 brow 	 n 	 	it	is	.
we	have	tar	paper	on	the	 roof 	 top 	 s 	 	that	 bounc 	 es 	 	heat	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	,	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	global	climate	change	,	no	doubt	.
what	about	in	100	 year 	 s 	 	,	if	we	have	green	 roof 	 top 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	and	 garden 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	create	our	own	 crop 	 s 	 	right	in	the	cities	?	we	 s 	 ave 	 	on	the	 cost 	 s 	 	of	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	we	 s 	 ave 	 	on	a	 health 	 ier 	 	diet	,	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	 educ 	 ate 	 	and	create	new	 job 	 s 	 	 local 	 ly 	 	.
we	need	bees	for	the	future	of	our	cities	and	urban	living	.
here	's	some	data	that	we	 collect 	 ed 	 	through	our	company	with	best	bees	,	where	we	deliver	,	install	and	manage	 honey 	 bee 	 	 hive 	 s 	 	for	 any 	 body 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	them	,	in	the	city	,	in	the	 country 	 side 	 	,	and	we	 introduc 	 e 	 	 honey 	 bees 	 	,	and	the	idea	of	 beekee 	 ping 	 	in	your	own	 back 	 yard 	 	or	 roof 	 top 	 	or	fire	 es 	 cape 	 	,	for	even	that	matter	,	and	 see 	 ing 	 	how	simple	it	is	and	how	possible	it	is	.
there	's	a	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	trend	that	we	 notice 	 d 	 	in	these	 number 	 s 	 	.	so	let	's	look	at	the	first	metric	here	,	overwintering	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	huge	problem	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	since	the	late	1980s	,	when	the	varroa	mite	came	and	 br 	 ought 	 	 man 	 y 	 	different	viruses	,	bacteria	and	 f 	 ung 	 al 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	with	it	.
overwintering	success	is	hard	,	and	that	's	when	most	of	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	are	lost	,	and	we	found	that	in	the	cities	,	bees	are	 surviv 	 ing 	 	better	than	they	are	in	the	country	.
a	bit	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	,	right	?
we	think	,	oh	,	bees	,	 country 	 side 	 	,	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	but	that	's	not	what	the	bees	are	 show 	 ing 	 	.
the	bees	like	it	in	the	city	.
 further 	 more 	 	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	produce	more	honey	.
the	urban	honey	is	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
the	bees	in	boston	on	the	 roof 	 top 	 	of	the	seaport	hotel	,	where	we	have	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	bees	 fly 	 ing 	 	 over 	 heard 	 	right	now	that	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	you	 notice 	 d 	 	when	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	by	,	are	going	to	all	of	the	local	community	 garden 	 s 	 	and	making	 delic 	 ious 	 	,	 health 	 y 	 	honey	that	just	 taste 	 s 	 	like	the	 flower 	 s 	 	in	our	city	.
so	the	yield	for	urban	 hive 	 s 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	honey	production	,	is	 high 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	overwintering	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	bit	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	.
and	looking	back	 historic 	 ally 	 	at	the	 time 	 line 	 	of	 honey 	 bee 	 	health	,	we	can	go	back	to	the	year	950	and	see	that	there	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	great	 mortal 	 ity 	 	of	bees	in	ireland	.
so	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	bees	 to 	 day 	 	is	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	since	over	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	but	what	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	notice	are	these	 problem 	 s 	 	in	cities	.
so	one	thing	i	want	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	think	about	is	the	idea	of	what	an	urban	 is 	 land 	 	is	.
you	think	in	the	city	 may 	 be 	 	the	temperature	's	 warm 	 er 	 	.
why	are	bees	 do 	 ing 	 	better	in	the	city	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	question	now	to	help	us	understand	why	they	should	be	in	the	city	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	's	more	 poll 	 en 	 	in	the	city	.
with	the	 train 	 s 	 	coming	in	to	urban	 hub 	 s 	 	,	they	can	carry	 poll 	 en 	 	with	them	,	 ver 	 y 	 	light	 poll 	 en 	 	,	and	it	's	just	a	big	 super 	 market 	 	in	the	city	.
a	lot	of	linden	 tree 	 s 	 	live	 a 	 long 	 	the	 rail 	 road 	 	 track 	 s 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	are	 few 	 er 	 	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	in	the	cities	than	there	are	in	urban	 area 	 s 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	are	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	just	not	 think 	 ing 	 	about	yet	,	but	that	's	one	idea	to	think	about	,	urban	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	 colon 	 y 	 	collapse	 dis 	 order 	 	is	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	 affect 	 ing 	 	 honey 	 bees 	 	.	 honey 	 bees 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	's	a	huge	,	huge	grand	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	our	time	.
what	you	can	see	up	here	is	a	map	of	the	world	,	and	we	're	 track 	 ing 	 	the	spread	of	 th 	 is 	 	varroa	mite	.
now	,	the	varroa	mite	is	what	 change 	 d 	 	the	game	in	 beekee 	 ping 	 	,	and	you	can	see	,	at	the	top	right	,	the	 year 	 s 	 	are	changing	,	we	're	coming	up	to	modern	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	see	the	spread	of	the	varroa	mite	from	the	early	1900s	through	now	.
it	's	1968	,	and	we	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 cover 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
1971	,	we	saw	it	spread	to	europe	and	south	america	,	and	then	,	when	we	get	to	the	1980s	,	and	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	1987	,	the	varroa	mite	 final 	 ly 	 	came	to	north	america	and	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	when	the	game	 change 	 d 	 	for	 honey 	 bees 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	us	will	remember	our	 child 	 hood 	 	growing	up	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	got	stung	by	a	bee	,	you	saw	bees	on	 flower 	 s 	 	.
think	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.	 the 	 ir 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	's	a	bit	different	.
they	do	n't	experience	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	bees	just	are	n't	around	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	we	need	bees	and	they	're	 disappear 	 ing 	 	and	it	's	a	big	problem	.
what	can	we	do	here	?
so	,	what	i	do	is	 honey 	 bee 	 	research	.
i	got	my	ph.d.	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 honey 	 bee 	 	health	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	2005	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 honey 	 bees 	 	.
in	2006	,	 honey 	 bees 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 disappear 	 ing 	 	,	so	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	like	,	 th 	 is 	 	little	nerd	kid	going	to	school	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 bug 	 s 	 	--	--	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	relevant	in	the	world	.
and	it	 work 	 ed 	 	out	that	way	.
so	my	research	 focus 	 es 	 	on	ways	to	make	bees	 health 	 ier 	 	.
i	do	n't	research	what	's	 kill 	 ing 	 	the	bees	,	per	 s 	 e 	 	.
i	'm	not	one	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	around	the	world	who	's	looking	at	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	or	 disease 	 s 	 	or	 habit 	 at 	 	loss	and	poor	nutrition	on	bees	.
we	're	looking	at	ways	to	make	bees	 health 	 ier 	 	through	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	through	yogurt	,	like	probiotics	,	and	other	 type 	 s 	 	of	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	in	ways	that	can	be	fed	 or 	 ally 	 	to	bees	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	so	easy	,	even	a	7	-	year	-	old	can	do	it	.
you	just	mix	up	some	 poll 	 en 	 	,	sugar	and	water	,	and	 what 	 ever 	 	active	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	you	want	to	put	in	,	and	you	just	give	it	right	to	the	bees	.	no	 chemical 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	,	just	 immun 	 e 	 	 boost 	 ers 	 	.
 human 	 s 	 	think	about	our	own	health	in	a	 prospect 	 ive 	 	way	.
we	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	we	eat	 health 	 y 	 	,	we	take	 vita 	 min 	 s 	 	.
why	do	n't	we	think	about	 honey 	 bees 	 	in	that	same	type	of	way	?
 br 	 ing 	 	them	to	 area 	 s 	 	where	they	're	 thriv 	 ing 	 	and	try	to	make	them	 health 	 ier 	 	before	they	get	sick	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	in	grad	school	 try 	 ing 	 	to	poke	bees	and	do	 vaccin 	 es 	 	with	 needle 	 s 	 	.	like	,	 year 	 s 	 	,	 year 	 s 	 	at	the	bench	,	``	oh	my	 go 	 sh 	 	,	it	's	3	a.m	.
and	i	'm	still	 prick 	 ing 	 	bees	.	``
and	then	one	day	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	we	just	do	an	 or 	 al 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	?	``
it	's	like	,	``	ugh	,	``	so	that	's	what	we	do	.
i	'd	love	to	share	with	you	some	 image 	 s 	 	of	urban	 bee 	 hive 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	can	be	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	mean	,	 re 	 ally 	 	open	your	mind	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	can	paint	a	hive	to	match	your	home	.
you	can	hide	a	hive	 in 	 side 	 	your	home	.
these	are	three	 hive 	 s 	 	on	the	 roof 	 top 	 	of	the	fairmont	copley	plaza	hotel	,	and	they	're	 beaut 	 iful 	 	here	.	i	mean	,	we	 match 	 ed 	 	the	new	color	of	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	rooms	to	do	some	type	of	a	 stain 	 ed 	 	wood	with	blue	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 sheet 	 s 	 	,	and	these	bees	are	 terr 	 ific 	 	,	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	will	use	 herb 	 s 	 	that	are	growing	in	the	garden	.
that	's	what	the	 chef 	 s 	 	go	to	to	use	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	honey	--	they	do	live	 event 	 s 	 	--	they	'll	use	that	honey	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 bar 	 s 	 	.
honey	is	a	great	 nutrition 	 al 	 	 substitut 	 e 	 	for	regular	sugar	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 sugar 	 s 	 	in	there	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	 class 	 room 	 	 hive 	 s 	 	project	,	where	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 non 	 profit 	 	venture	--	we	're	 spread 	 ing 	 	the	word	around	the	world	for	how	 honey 	 bee 	 	 hive 	 s 	 	can	be	taken	 in 	 to 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	or	 in 	 to 	 	the	museum	setting	,	 be 	 hind 	 	glass	,	and	used	 a 	 s 	 	an	 education 	 al 	 	tool	.
 th 	 is 	 	hive	that	you	see	here	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	fenway	high	school	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
the	bees	fly	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	outfield	of	fenway	park	.
 no 	 body 	 	 notice 	 s 	 	it	.	if	you	're	not	a	flower	,	these	bees	do	not	care	about	you	.
they	do	n't	.	they	do	n't	.	they	'll	say	,	``	s'cuse	me	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	.	``
some	other	 image 	 s 	 	here	in	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	part	of	the	story	that	 re 	 ally 	 	made	urban	 beekee 	 ping 	 	 terr 	 ific 	 	is	in	new	york	city	,	 beekee 	 ping 	 	was	 il 	 legal 	 	 un 	 til 	 	2010	.
that	's	a	big	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	's	going	to	 pollinat 	 e 	 	all	of	the	 garden 	 s 	 	and	the	produce	 local 	 ly 	 	?	 hand 	 s 	 	?
i	mean	,	 local 	 ly 	 	in	boston	,	there	is	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	company	 call 	 ed 	 	green	city	 grow 	 ers 	 	,	and	they	are	going	and	 pollinat 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	squash	 crop 	 s 	 	by	hand	with	q	-	 tip 	 s 	 	,	and	if	they	 mis 	 s 	 	that	three	day	window	,	there	's	no	fruit	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 client 	 s 	 	are	n't	happy	,	and	people	go	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
we	have	 al 	 so 	 	some	 image 	 s 	 	of	honey	from	brooklyn	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 myster 	 y 	 	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	where	the	honey	was	 ver 	 y 	 	red	,	and	the	new	york	state	 forensic 	 s 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	came	in	and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	some	science	to	match	the	red	dye	with	that	found	in	a	maraschino	 cher 	 ry 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	down	the	street	.
so	you	can	tailor	your	honey	to	taste	 how 	 ever 	 	you	want	by	 plant 	 ing 	 	bee	-	friendly	 flower 	 s 	 	.

what	can	you	do	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	bees	or	to	help	them	or	to	think	of	 sustain 	 able 	 	cities	in	the	future	?
well	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	just	change	your	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
try	to	understand	that	bees	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
a	bee	is	n't	going	to	 s 	 ting 	 	you	if	you	see	it	.
the	bee	dies	.	 honey 	 bees 	 	die	when	they	 s 	 ting 	 	,	so	they	do	n't	want	to	do	it	either	.
it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	panic	about	.	they	're	all	over	the	city	.
you	could	even	get	your	own	hive	if	you	want	.
there	are	great	 resource 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	there	are	even	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	will	help	get	you	set	up	and	mentor	you	and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	our	 education 	 al 	 	system	in	the	world	for	 student 	 s 	 	to	learn	about	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	,	who	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	not	even	 get 	 ting 	 	stung	.
