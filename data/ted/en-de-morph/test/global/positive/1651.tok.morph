 th 	 is 	 	is	how	war	 start 	 s 	 	.
one	day	you	're	living	your	 ordin 	 ary 	 	life	,	you	're	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	go	to	a	party	,	you	're	taking	your	children	to	school	,	you	're	making	a	 dent 	 ist 	 	appointment	.
the	next	thing	,	the	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	go	out	,	the	tvs	go	out	,	there	's	 arm 	 ed 	 	men	on	the	street	,	there	's	 road 	 block 	 s 	 	.
your	life	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	.
it	 stop 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	steal	a	story	from	a	friend	of	mine	,	a	bosnian	friend	,	about	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	her	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	will	 illustr 	 ate 	 	for	you	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	.
she	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	to	work	one	day	in	april	,	1992	,	in	a	 mini 	 skirt 	 	and	high	 heel 	 s 	 	.	she	 work 	 ed 	 	in	a	bank	.
she	was	a	young	mother	.	she	was	 some 	 one 	 	who	 like 	 d 	 	to	party	.
great	person	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	she	 s 	 ees 	 	a	tank	 am 	 bling 	 	down	the	main	road	of	sarajevo	 knock 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	out	of	 it 	 s 	 	path	.
she	 think 	 s 	 	she	's	 dream 	 ing 	 	,	but	she	's	not	.
and	she	 run 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	any	of	us	would	have	 d 	 one 	 	and	 take 	 s 	 	cover	,	and	she	 hide 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	trash	bin	,	in	her	high	 heel 	 s 	 	and	her	 mini 	 skirt 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	she	's	 hid 	 ing 	 	there	,	she	's	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	but	she	's	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tank	go	by	with	 soldier 	 s 	 	and	people	all	over	the	place	and	 cha 	 os 	 	and	she	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	i	feel	like	alice	in	 wonder 	 land 	 	going	down	the	 rabbi 	 t 	 	hole	,	down	,	down	,	down	 in 	 to 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	,	and	my	life	will	never	be	the	same	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	my	friend	was	in	a	crowd	of	people	 push 	 ing 	 	with	her	infant	son	in	her	 arm 	 s 	 	to	give	him	to	a	 strange 	 r 	 	on	a	bus	,	which	was	one	of	the	last	 bus 	 es 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	sarajevo	to	take	children	out	so	they	could	be	safe	.
and	she	 remember 	 s 	 	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	her	mother	to	the	front	,	 crowd 	 s 	 	and	 crowd 	 s 	 	of	people	,	``	take	my	child	!	take	my	child	!	``
and	 pass 	 ing 	 	her	son	to	 some 	 one 	 	through	a	window	.
and	she	did	n't	see	him	for	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	siege	went	on	for	three	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	it	was	a	siege	 with 	 out 	 	water	,	 with 	 out 	 	power	,	 with 	 out 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	heat	,	 with 	 out 	 	food	,	in	the	middle	of	europe	,	in	the	middle	of	the	20th	century	.
i	had	the	honor	of	 be 	 ing 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 report 	 ers 	 	that	lived	through	that	siege	,	and	i	say	i	have	the	honor	and	the	privilege	of	 be 	 ing 	 	there	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	taught	me	 every 	 thing 	 	,	not	just	about	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 report 	 er 	 	,	but	about	 be 	 ing 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	who	could	be	heroes	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	sharing	.	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 cama 	 raderie 	 	.
most	of	all	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	love	.
even	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	 terr 	 ible 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	and	death	and	 cha 	 os 	 	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	could	help	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	share	food	,	raise	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	drag	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 snip 	 ed 	 	at	from	the	middle	of	the	road	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	 your 	 self 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ing 	 	your	life	,	 help 	 ing 	 	people	get	 in 	 to 	 	 taxi 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 inju 	 red 	 	to	try	to	take	them	to	 hospital 	 s 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	so	much	about	 my 	 self 	 	.
martha	gellhorn	,	who	's	one	of	my	heroes	,	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	love	one	war	.	the	rest	is	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.	``
i	went	on	to	cover	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 war 	 s 	 	after	that	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	that	i	lost	count	,	but	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	sarajevo	.
last	april	,	i	went	back	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	--	what	i	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 de 	 rang 	 ed 	 	high	school	 re 	 un 	 ion 	 	.
what	it	was	,	was	the	20th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	the	siege	,	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	siege	of	sarajevo	,	and	i	do	n't	like	the	word	``	 annivers 	 ary 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	party	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	a	party	.
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 som 	 ber 	 	 gather 	 ing 	 	of	the	 report 	 ers 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	there	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	war	,	 human 	 itarian 	 	aid	 work 	 ers 	 	,	and	of	course	the	brave	and	 courage 	 ous 	 	people	of	sarajevo	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	the	thing	that	 s 	 truck 	 	me	the	most	,	that	broke	my	heart	,	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	down	the	main	street	of	sarajevo	,	where	my	friend	aida	saw	the	tank	coming	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	in	that	road	 we 	 re 	 	more	than	12,000	red	 chair 	 s 	 	,	empty	,	and	every	single	one	of	them	 symbol 	 ized 	 	a	person	who	had	 di 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	siege	,	just	in	sarajevo	,	not	in	all	of	bosnia	,	and	it	 stretch 	 ed 	 	from	one	end	of	the	city	to	a	large	part	of	it	,	and	the	 s 	 add 	 est 	 	for	me	 we 	 re 	 	the	 tin 	 y 	 	little	 chair 	 s 	 	for	the	children	.
i	now	cover	syria	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 report 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	a	story	there	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	told	.
i	see	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	template	of	the	war	in	bosnia	.
and	when	i	first	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	damascus	,	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	strange	moment	where	people	did	n't	seem	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	war	was	going	to	descend	,	and	it	was	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	in	bosnia	and	 near 	 ly 	 	every	other	country	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	where	war	 come 	 s 	 	.
people	do	n't	want	to	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	coming	,	so	they	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	,	they	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	before	they	can	.
they	do	n't	get	 the 	 ir 	 	money	out	.
they	stay	 be 	 cause 	 	you	want	to	stay	in	your	home	.
and	then	war	and	 cha 	 os 	 	descend	.
rwanda	is	a	place	that	 haunt 	 s 	 	me	a	lot	.
in	1994	,	i	 brief 	 ly 	 	left	sarajevo	to	go	report	the	genocide	in	rwanda	.
between	april	and	august	,	1994	,	one	million	people	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 laughter 	 ed 	 	.
now	if	 t 	 hose 	 	12,000	 chair 	 s 	 	 freak 	 ed 	 	me	out	with	the	 she 	 er 	 	number	,	i	want	you	just	for	a	second	to	think	of	a	million	people	.
and	to	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	remember	 stand 	 ing 	 	and	looking	down	a	road	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	see	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	mile	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	bodies	 pil 	 ed 	 	twice	my	height	of	the	dead	.
and	that	was	just	a	small	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	dead	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	caught	in	 the 	 ir 	 	last	death	throes	.
so	we	learn	a	lot	from	war	,	and	i	 ment 	 ion 	 	rwanda	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	one	place	,	like	south	africa	,	where	 near 	 ly 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	on	,	there	is	 heal 	 ing 	 	.
fifty	-	six	percent	of	the	 parliament 	 arian 	 s 	 	are	women	,	which	is	fantastic	,	and	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	national	 constit 	 ution 	 	now	,	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	say	hutu	or	tutsi	.
you	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	identify	 any 	 one 	 	by	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	,	of	course	,	what	 start 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 laughter 	 	in	the	first	place	.
and	an	aid	 work 	 er 	 	friend	of	mine	told	me	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	story	,	or	i	find	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
there	was	a	group	of	children	,	 mix 	 ed 	 	hutus	and	tutsis	,	and	a	group	of	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	 adopt 	 ing 	 	them	,	and	they	lined	up	and	one	was	just	 give 	 n 	 	to	the	next	.
there	was	no	kind	of	 compens 	 ation 	 	for	,	you	're	a	tutsi	,	you	're	a	hutu	,	you	might	have	 kill 	 ed 	 	my	mother	,	you	might	have	 kill 	 ed 	 	my	father	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	just	 br 	 ought 	 	together	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	,	and	i	find	 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	.
so	when	people	ask	me	how	i	 continu 	 e 	 	to	cover	war	,	and	why	i	 continu 	 e 	 	to	do	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	.
when	i	go	back	to	syria	,	next	week	in	fact	,	what	i	see	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 hero 	 ic 	 	people	,	some	of	them	 fight 	 ing 	 	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	for	 thing 	 s 	 	we	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	every	single	day	.
and	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	why	i	do	it	.
in	2004	,	i	had	a	little	baby	boy	,	and	i	call	him	my	miracle	child	,	 be 	 cause 	 	after	 see 	 ing 	 	so	much	death	and	 destruct 	 ion 	 	and	 cha 	 os 	 	and	 dark 	 ness 	 	in	my	life	,	 th 	 is 	 	ray	of	hope	was	born	.
and	i	 call 	 ed 	 	him	luca	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	``	the	 br 	 ing 	 er 	 	of	light	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	light	to	my	life	.
but	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	him	 be 	 cause 	 	when	he	was	four	 month 	 s 	 	old	,	my	foreign	editor	 force 	 d 	 	me	to	go	back	to	baghdad	where	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 report 	 ing 	 	all	 through 	 out 	 	the	saddam	regime	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	fall	of	baghdad	and	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	and	i	remember	 get 	 ting 	 	on	the	plane	in	 tear 	 s 	 	,	 cry 	 ing 	 	to	be	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	my	son	,	and	while	i	was	there	,	a	 quit 	 e 	 	famous	iraqi	 politic 	 ian 	 	who	was	a	friend	of	mine	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?
why	are	n't	you	home	with	luca	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	have	to	see	.	``	it	was	2004	which	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 blood 	 y 	 	time	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	``	i	have	to	see	,	i	have	to	see	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.
i	have	to	report	it	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	go	home	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 mis 	 s 	 	his	first	tooth	,	if	you	 mis 	 s 	 	his	first	step	,	you	'll	never	forgive	 your 	 self 	 	.
but	there	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 an 	 other 	 	war	.	``
and	there	,	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 war 	 s 	 	.
and	i	am	 delud 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	if	i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	journalist	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 report 	 er 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	writer	,	what	i	do	can	stop	them	.	i	ca	n't	.
i	'm	not	kofi	annan	.	he	ca	n't	stop	a	war	.
he	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	syria	and	could	n't	do	it	.
i	'm	not	a	u.n.	conflict	 re 	 solution 	 	person	.
i	'm	not	even	a	 human 	 itarian 	 	aid	doctor	,	and	i	ca	n't	tell	you	the	 time 	 s 	 	of	how	 help 	 less 	 	i	've	felt	to	have	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	me	,	and	i	could	n't	 s 	 ave 	 	them	.
all	i	am	is	a	witness	.
my	role	is	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	voice	to	people	who	are	 voice 	 less 	 	.
a	 col 	 league 	 	of	mine	 de 	 scribed 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	to	shine	a	light	in	the	 dark 	 est 	 	 corner 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
and	that	's	what	i	try	to	do	.
i	'm	not	 al 	 ways 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	feel	like	you	're	writing	 in 	 to 	 	a	void	,	or	you	feel	like	no	one	 care 	 s 	 	.
who	 care 	 s 	 	about	syria	?	who	 care 	 s 	 	about	bosnia	?
who	 care 	 s 	 	about	the	congo	,	the	 iv 	 ory 	 	coast	,	liberia	,	sierra	leone	,	all	of	these	 string 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	that	i	will	remember	for	the	rest	of	my	life	?
but	my	 m 	 é 	 tier 	 	is	to	bear	witness	and	that	is	the	crux	,	the	heart	of	the	matter	,	for	us	 report 	 ers 	 	who	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	all	i	can	 re 	 ally 	 	do	is	hope	,	not	to	 policy 	 makers 	 	or	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	i	'd	like	to	have	faith	that	they	read	my	 word 	 s 	 	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	i	do	n't	 d 	 elude 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
but	what	i	do	hope	is	that	if	you	remember	 any 	 thing 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	or	any	of	my	 st 	 ories 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	over	 break 	 fast 	 	,	if	you	can	remember	the	story	of	sarajevo	,	or	the	story	of	rwanda	,	then	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	my	job	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
