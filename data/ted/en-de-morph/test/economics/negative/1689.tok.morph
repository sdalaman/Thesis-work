i	can	see	i	've	got	my	work	cut	out	for	me	here	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	from	dr.	insel	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	like	 aut 	 ism 	 	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	take	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	toll	on	human	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
we	know	much	less	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	and	the	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	than	we	do	about	 disease 	 s 	 	of	the	body	.
think	about	it	:	in	2013	,	the	second	decade	of	the	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	,	if	you	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	a	cancer	 diagnos 	 is 	 	and	you	go	to	your	doctor	,	you	get	bone	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	,	 bio 	 psies 	 	and	blood	 test 	 s 	 	.
in	2013	,	if	you	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	a	 depress 	 ion 	 	 diagnos 	 is 	 	,	you	go	to	your	doctor	,	and	what	do	you	get	?
a	 question 	 naire 	 	.
now	,	part	of	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	we	have	an	 over 	 simpl 	 ified 	 	and	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 out 	 mod 	 ed 	 	view	of	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
we	tend	to	view	them	--	and	the	popular	press	 aid 	 s 	 	and	abets	 th 	 is 	 	view	--	 a 	 s 	 	chemical	imbalances	in	the	brain	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	brain	 we 	 re 	 	some	kind	of	bag	of	chemical	soup	full	of	dopamine	,	serotonin	and	norepinephrine	.
 th 	 is 	 	view	is	 condition 	 ed 	 	by	the	fact	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 drug 	 s 	 	that	are	 pre 	 scribed 	 	to	treat	these	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	,	like	prozac	,	act	by	 global 	 ly 	 	changing	brain	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	brain	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	a	bag	of	chemical	soup	.
but	that	ca	n't	be	the	answer	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 drug 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	work	all	that	well	.
a	lot	of	people	wo	n't	take	them	,	or	stop	taking	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	.
these	 drug 	 s 	 	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	using	them	to	treat	a	complex	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	is	a	bit	like	 try 	 ing 	 	to	change	your	engine	oil	by	 open 	 ing 	 	a	can	and	 pour 	 ing 	 	it	all	over	the	engine	block	.
some	of	it	will	dribble	 in 	 to 	 	the	right	place	,	but	a	lot	of	it	will	do	more	harm	than	good	.
now	,	an	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	view	that	you	 al 	 so 	 	heard	about	from	dr.	insel	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	is	that	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 disturb 	 ance 	 s 	 	of	neural	 circuit 	 s 	 	that	mediate	emotion	,	mood	and	affect	.
when	we	think	about	cognition	,	we	analogize	the	brain	to	a	computer	.	that	's	no	problem	.
well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	computer	 analog 	 y 	 	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	valid	for	emotion	.
it	's	just	that	we	do	n't	tend	to	think	about	it	that	way	.
but	we	know	much	less	about	the	circuit	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 domin 	 ance 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	chemical	 im 	 balance 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	.
now	,	it	's	not	that	 chemical 	 s 	 	are	not	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	that	they	do	n't	 bath 	 e 	 	the	brain	like	soup	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	they	're	released	in	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 location 	 s 	 	and	they	act	on	specific	 synapse 	 s 	 	to	change	the	flow	of	information	in	the	brain	.
so	if	we	ever	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	understand	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	 pin 	 point 	 	these	 location 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	where	these	 chemical 	 s 	 	act	.
 other 	 wise 	 	,	we	're	going	to	keep	 pour 	 ing 	 	oil	all	over	our	mental	 engine 	 s 	 	and	 suffer 	 ing 	 	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
now	to	begin	to	 over 	 come 	 	our	 ignor 	 ance 	 	of	the	role	of	brain	 chemist 	 ry 	 	in	brain	 circuit 	 ry 	 	,	it	's	 help 	 ful 	 	to	work	on	what	we	 biologist 	 s 	 	call	``	model	 organism 	 s 	 	,	``	 animal 	 s 	 	like	fruit	flies	and	 labor 	 atory 	 	 mic 	 e 	 	,	in	which	we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	genetic	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	molecularly	identify	and	 pin 	 point 	 	specific	 class 	 es 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	heard	about	in	allan	jones	's	talk	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	once	we	can	do	that	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	activate	specific	 neuro 	 ns 	 	or	we	can	destroy	or	inhibit	the	activity	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
so	if	we	inhibit	a	 part 	 icular 	 	type	of	 neuro 	 n 	 	,	and	we	find	that	a	behavior	is	 block 	 ed 	 	,	we	can	conclude	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	are	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	that	behavior	.
on	the	other	hand	,	if	we	activate	a	group	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	we	find	that	that	 produce 	 s 	 	the	behavior	,	we	can	conclude	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	are	sufficient	for	the	behavior	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	test	,	we	can	draw	cause	and	effect	 relationship 	 s 	 	between	the	activity	of	specific	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	and	 part 	 icular 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	difficult	,	if	not	 im 	 possible 	 	,	to	do	right	now	in	 human 	 s 	 	.
but	can	an	organism	like	a	fruit	fly	,	which	is	--	it	's	a	great	model	organism	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	got	a	small	brain	,	it	's	 cap 	 able 	 	of	complex	and	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	it	 breed 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	it	's	cheap	.
but	can	an	organism	like	 th 	 is 	 	teach	us	 any 	 thing 	 	about	emotion	-	like	 state 	 s 	 	?
do	these	 organism 	 s 	 	even	have	emotion	-	like	 state 	 s 	 	,	or	are	they	just	little	digital	 robot 	 s 	 	?
charles	darwin	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	 insect 	 s 	 	have	emotion	and	express	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	wrote	in	his	1872	monograph	on	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	the	 emotion 	 s 	 	in	man	and	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	my	eponymous	 col 	 league 	 	,	seymour	benzer	,	 believ 	 ed 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
seymour	is	the	man	that	 introduc 	 ed 	 	the	use	of	drosophila	here	at	caltech	in	the	'60s	 a 	 s 	 	a	model	organism	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	 gene 	 s 	 	and	behavior	.
seymour	 recruit 	 ed 	 	me	to	caltech	in	the	late	1980s	.
he	was	my	jedi	and	my	rabbi	while	he	was	here	,	and	seymour	taught	me	both	to	love	flies	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	play	with	science	.
so	how	do	we	ask	 th 	 is 	 	question	?
it	's	one	thing	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	flies	have	emotion	-	like	 state 	 s 	 	,	but	how	do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	find	out	 whet 	 her 	 	that	's	true	or	not	?
now	,	in	 human 	 s 	 	we	often	infer	 emotion 	 al 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	'll	hear	 lat 	 er 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	from	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	it	's	a	little	difficult	to	do	that	in	fruit	flies	.
it	's	kind	of	like	 land 	 ing 	 	on	mars	and	looking	out	the	window	of	your	 space 	 ship 	 	at	all	the	little	green	men	who	are	 surround 	 ing 	 	it	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	,	``	how	do	i	find	out	if	they	have	 emotion 	 s 	 	or	not	?	``
what	can	we	do	?	it	's	not	so	easy	.
well	,	one	of	the	ways	that	we	can	start	is	to	try	to	come	up	with	some	general	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	or	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	emotion	-	like	 state 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	arousal	,	and	see	if	we	can	identify	any	fly	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	might	exhibit	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
so	three	 import 	 ant 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	i	can	think	of	are	 persist 	 ence 	 	,	gradations	in	 intens 	 ity 	 	,	and	valence	.
 persist 	 ence 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	long	-	 last 	 ing 	 	.
we	all	know	that	the	 stimul 	 us 	 	that	 trigger 	 s 	 	an	emotion	 cause 	 s 	 	that	emotion	to	last	long	after	the	 stimul 	 us 	 	is	gone	.
gradations	of	 intens 	 ity 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	what	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	.
you	can	dial	up	the	 intens 	 ity 	 	or	dial	down	the	 intens 	 ity 	 	of	an	emotion	.
if	you	're	a	little	bit	 un 	 happy 	 	,	the	 corner 	 s 	 	of	your	mouth	turn	down	and	you	sniffle	,	and	if	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	,	 tear 	 s 	 	pour	down	your	face	and	you	might	sob	.
valence	 mean 	 s 	 	good	or	bad	,	positive	or	negative	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	see	if	flies	could	be	 provok 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	the	kind	of	behavior	that	you	see	by	the	proverbial	wasp	at	the	picnic	table	,	you	know	,	the	one	that	 keep 	 s 	 	coming	back	to	your	 ham 	 burger 	 	the	more	 vigor 	 ously 	 	you	try	to	swat	it	away	,	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	keep	 get 	 ting 	 	 irrit 	 ated 	 	.
so	we	built	a	 de 	 vice 	 	,	which	we	call	a	puff	-	o	-	mat	,	in	which	we	could	deliver	little	brief	air	 puff 	 s 	 	to	fruit	flies	in	these	plastic	 tube 	 s 	 	in	our	 labor 	 atory 	 	bench	and	blow	them	away	.
and	what	we	found	is	that	if	we	 g 	 ave 	 	these	flies	in	the	puff	-	o	-	mat	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 puff 	 s 	 	in	a	row	,	they	 be 	 came 	 	 some 	 what 	 	 hyper 	 active 	 	and	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	run	around	for	some	time	after	the	air	 puff 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	and	took	a	while	to	calm	down	.
so	we	 quant 	 ified 	 	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	using	custom	locomotor	 track 	 ing 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	with	my	 collabor 	 ator 	 	pietro	perona	,	who	's	in	the	 electric 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	division	here	at	caltech	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	 quant 	 ification 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	us	is	that	,	 up 	 on 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	a	train	of	these	air	 puff 	 s 	 	,	the	flies	appear	to	enter	a	kind	of	state	of	hyperactivity	which	is	 persist 	 ent 	 	,	long	-	 last 	 ing 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	 grad 	 ed 	 	.
more	 puff 	 s 	 	,	or	more	 intens 	 e 	 	 puff 	 s 	 	,	make	the	state	last	for	a	 long 	 er 	 	period	of	time	.
so	now	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	try	to	understand	 some 	 thing 	 	about	what	 control 	 s 	 	the	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	state	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	use	our	puff	-	o	-	mat	and	our	 autom 	 ated 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	screen	through	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	lines	of	 mut 	 ant 	 	fruit	flies	to	see	if	we	could	find	any	that	 show 	 ed 	 	 ab 	 normal 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	to	the	air	 puff 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	great	 thing 	 s 	 	about	fruit	flies	.
there	are	 re 	 posit 	 ories 	 	where	you	can	just	pick	up	the	phone	and	order	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 vial 	 s 	 	of	flies	of	different	 mut 	 ants 	 	and	screen	them	in	your	assay	and	then	find	out	what	gene	is	 affect 	 ed 	 	in	the	mutation	.
so	 do 	 ing 	 	the	screen	,	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	one	 mut 	 ant 	 	that	took	much	 long 	 er 	 	than	normal	to	calm	down	after	the	air	 puff 	 s 	 	,	and	when	we	 examine 	 d 	 	the	gene	that	was	 affect 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	mutation	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	encode	a	dopamine	receptor	.
that	's	right	--	flies	,	like	people	,	have	dopamine	,	and	it	 act 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	and	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 synapse 	 s 	 	through	the	same	dopamine	receptor	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	you	and	i	have	.
dopamine	 play 	 s 	 	a	number	of	 import 	 ant 	 	 function 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	in	attention	,	arousal	,	reward	,	and	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	of	the	dopamine	system	have	 be 	 en 	 	linked	to	a	number	of	mental	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	drug	abuse	,	parkinson	's	disease	,	and	adhd	.
now	,	in	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	little	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	.
we	tend	to	infer	the	normal	function	of	 some 	 thing 	 	by	what	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	when	we	take	it	away	,	by	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	what	we	see	when	we	take	it	away	.
so	when	we	take	away	the	dopamine	receptor	and	the	flies	take	 long 	 er 	 	to	calm	down	,	from	that	we	infer	that	the	normal	function	of	 th 	 is 	 	receptor	and	dopamine	is	to	cause	the	flies	to	calm	down	 fast 	 er 	 	after	the	puff	.
and	that	's	a	bit	 re 	 mini 	 s 	 cent 	 	of	adhd	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	linked	to	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	of	the	dopamine	system	in	 human 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	if	we	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 level 	 s 	 	of	dopamine	in	normal	flies	by	 feed 	 ing 	 	them	 coca 	 ine 	 	after	 get 	 ting 	 	the	appropriate	dea	 licens 	 e 	 	--	oh	my	god	--	--	we	find	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	that	these	 coca 	 ine 	 	-	fed	flies	calm	down	 fast 	 er 	 	than	normal	flies	do	,	and	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 mini 	 s 	 cent 	 	of	adhd	,	which	is	often	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 drug 	 s 	 	like	ritalin	that	act	 similar 	 ly 	 	to	 coca 	 ine 	 	.
so	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	what	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 play 	 ful 	 	attempt	to	try	to	annoy	fruit	flies	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	some	relevance	to	a	human	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	.
now	,	how	far	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 analog 	 y 	 	go	?
 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	,	 individual 	 s 	 	 affli 	 cted 	 	with	adhd	 al 	 so 	 	have	 learn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 abilities 	 	.
is	that	true	of	our	dopamine	receptor	 mut 	 ant 	 	flies	?
 remark 	 ably 	 	,	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	seymour	 show 	 ed 	 	back	in	the	1970s	,	flies	,	like	 song 	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	just	heard	,	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	train	a	fly	to	avoid	an	odor	,	 show 	 n 	 	here	in	blue	,	if	you	pair	that	odor	with	a	shock	.
then	when	you	give	 t 	 hose 	 	trained	flies	the	chance	to	 choos 	 e 	 	between	a	tube	with	the	shock	-	 pair 	 ed 	 	odor	and	 an 	 other 	 	odor	,	it	 avoid 	 s 	 	the	tube	 contain 	 ing 	 	the	blue	odor	that	was	 pair 	 ed 	 	with	shock	.
well	,	if	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	test	on	dopamine	receptor	 mut 	 ant 	 	flies	,	they	do	n't	learn	.	 the 	 ir 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	score	is	zero	.
they	flunk	out	of	caltech	.
so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	these	flies	have	two	 ab 	 normal 	 ities 	 	,	or	 pheno 	 type 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 genetic 	 ists 	 	call	them	,	that	one	 find 	 s 	 	in	adhd	:	hyperactivity	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 ability 	 	.
now	what	's	the	 caus 	 al 	 	relationship	,	if	 any 	 thing 	 	,	between	these	 pheno 	 type 	 s 	 	?
in	adhd	,	it	's	often	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	the	hyperactivity	 cause 	 s 	 	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 ability 	 	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	ca	n't	 s 	 it 	 	still	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	focus	,	so	they	do	n't	learn	.
but	it	could	 equal 	 ly 	 	be	the	case	that	it	's	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 abilities 	 	that	cause	the	hyperactivity	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 kid 	 s 	 	ca	n't	learn	,	they	look	for	other	 thing 	 s 	 	to	distract	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	.
and	a	final	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	that	there	's	no	relationship	at	all	between	 learn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 abilities 	 	and	hyperactivity	,	but	that	they	are	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	a	common	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	in	adhd	.
now	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	long	time	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	but	in	flies	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	test	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	way	that	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	delve	 deep 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	mind	of	the	fly	and	begin	to	 un 	 tangle 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 circuit 	 ry 	 	using	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
we	take	our	dopamine	receptor	 mut 	 ant 	 	flies	and	we	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 re 	 store 	 	,	or	cure	,	the	dopamine	receptor	by	 put 	 ting 	 	a	good	copy	of	the	dopamine	receptor	gene	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	fly	brain	.
but	in	each	fly	,	we	put	it	back	 on 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	certain	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	not	in	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	test	each	of	these	flies	for	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	learn	and	for	hyperactivity	.
 remark 	 ably 	 	,	we	find	we	can	 complete 	 ly 	 	dissociate	these	two	 ab 	 normal 	 ities 	 	.
if	we	put	a	good	copy	of	the	dopamine	receptor	back	in	 th 	 is 	 	 elli 	 pt 	 ical 	 	structure	 call 	 ed 	 	the	central	complex	,	the	flies	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 hyper 	 active 	 	,	but	they	still	ca	n't	learn	.
on	the	other	hand	,	if	we	put	the	receptor	back	in	a	different	structure	 call 	 ed 	 	the	mushroom	body	,	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	 defici 	 t 	 	is	 rescu 	 ed 	 	,	the	flies	learn	well	,	but	they	're	still	 hyper 	 active 	 	.
what	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	is	that	dopamine	is	not	 bath 	 ing 	 	the	brain	of	these	flies	like	soup	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	it	's	 act 	 ing 	 	to	control	two	different	 function 	 s 	 	on	two	different	 circuit 	 s 	 	,	so	the	reason	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	with	our	dopamine	receptor	flies	is	that	the	same	receptor	is	 controll 	 ing 	 	two	different	 function 	 s 	 	in	two	different	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	.
 whet 	 her 	 	the	same	thing	is	true	in	adhd	in	 human 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	know	,	but	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 result 	 s 	 	should	at	 l 	 east 	 	cause	us	to	consider	that	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
so	these	 result 	 s 	 	make	me	and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	more	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	than	ever	that	the	brain	is	not	a	bag	of	chemical	soup	,	and	it	's	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	to	try	to	treat	complex	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	just	by	changing	the	flavor	of	the	soup	.
what	we	need	to	do	is	to	use	our	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	and	our	scientific	knowledge	to	try	to	design	a	new	generation	of	 treat 	 ments 	 	that	are	 target 	 ed 	 	to	specific	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	specific	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	that	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
if	we	can	do	that	,	we	may	be	able	to	cure	these	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	the	oil	back	in	our	mental	 engine 	 s 	 	,	just	where	it	's	 need 	 ed 	 	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
