i	'd	like	to	tell	you	about	two	 game 	 s 	 	of	 ches 	 s 	 	.
the	first	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	1997	,	in	which	garry	kasparov	,	a	human	,	lost	to	deep	blue	,	a	machine	.
to	 man 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	dawn	of	a	new	era	,	one	where	man	would	be	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	machine	.
but	here	we	are	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	on	,	and	the	 great 	 est 	 	change	in	how	we	 re 	 late 	 	to	 computer 	 s 	 	is	the	ipad	,	not	hal	.
the	second	game	was	a	 free 	 style 	 	 ches 	 s 	 	tournament	in	2005	,	in	which	man	and	machine	could	enter	together	 a 	 s 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 advers 	 aries 	 	,	if	they	so	chose	.
at	first	,	the	 result 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
even	a	 super 	 computer 	 	was	 beat 	 en 	 	by	a	 grand 	 master 	 	with	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	weak	 lap 	 top 	 	.
the	surprise	came	at	the	end	.	who	won	?
not	a	 grand 	 master 	 	with	a	 super 	 computer 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	two	american	 amateur 	 s 	 	using	three	 relat 	 ively 	 	weak	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	coach	and	 manipul 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	to	 deep 	 ly 	 	explore	specific	 position 	 s 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	 counter 	 act 	 ed 	 	the	 super 	 ior 	 	 ches 	 s 	 	knowledge	of	the	 grandma 	 sters 	 	and	the	 super 	 ior 	 	 computation 	 al 	 	power	of	other	 advers 	 aries 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 astonish 	 ing 	 	result	:	average	men	,	average	 machine 	 s 	 	 beat 	 ing 	 	the	best	man	,	the	best	machine	.
and	 any 	 ways 	 	,	is	n't	it	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	man	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	machine	?
 in 	 stead 	 	,	it	's	about	 co 	 operation 	 	,	and	the	right	type	of	 co 	 operation 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	attention	to	marvin	minsky	's	vision	for	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	over	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	sexy	vision	,	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.	 man 	 y 	 	have	 embrace 	 d 	 	it	.
it	's	 be 	 come 	 	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	school	of	thought	in	computer	science	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	we	enter	the	era	of	big	data	,	of	network	 system 	 s 	 	,	of	open	 platform 	 s 	 	,	and	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	technology	,	i	'd	like	to	suggest	it	's	time	to	 re 	 evaluate 	 	an	 alter 	 native 	 	vision	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	around	the	same	time	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	j.c.r	.	licklider	's	human	-	computer	 sym 	 bio 	 sis 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	better	 term 	 ed 	 	``	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 augment 	 ation 	 	,	``	i.a	.
licklider	was	a	computer	science	titan	who	had	a	 pro 	 found 	 	effect	on	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	technology	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
his	vision	was	to	 en 	 able 	 	man	and	machine	to	cooperate	in	making	 decision 	 s 	 	,	 controll 	 ing 	 	complex	 situ 	 ations 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 in 	 flex 	 ible 	 	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	 pre 	 determine 	 d 	 	 program 	 s 	 	.
note	that	word	``	cooperate	.	``
licklider	 encourag 	 es 	 	us	not	to	take	a	 toast 	 er 	 	and	make	it	data	from	``	star	trek	,	``	but	to	take	a	human	and	make	her	more	 cap 	 able 	 	.
 human 	 s 	 	are	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	--	how	we	think	,	our	non	-	linear	 approach 	 es 	 	,	our	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	 ite 	 rative 	 	 hypo 	 these 	 s 	 	,	all	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	if	possible	at	all	for	 computer 	 s 	 	to	do	.
licklider	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 contempl 	 ating 	 	 human 	 s 	 	setting	the	 goal 	 s 	 	,	 formula 	 ting 	 	the	 hypo 	 these 	 s 	 	,	 determi 	 ning 	 	the	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	,	and	 perform 	 ing 	 	the	 evalu 	 ation 	 	.
of	course	,	in	other	ways	,	 human 	 s 	 	are	so	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
we	're	 terr 	 ible 	 	at	scale	,	computation	and	volume	.
we	 requir 	 e 	 	high	-	end	talent	management	to	keep	the	rock	band	together	and	 play 	 ing 	 	.
licklider	 fore 	 saw 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	all	the	 r 	 out 	 in 	 izable 	 	work	that	was	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	the	way	for	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	and	decision	making	.
 silent 	 ly 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	much	 fan 	 fare 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	approach	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 compil 	 ing 	 	 vict 	 ories 	 	beyond	 ches 	 s 	 	.
protein	 fold 	 ing 	 	,	a	 top 	 ic 	 	that	 share 	 s 	 	the	 in 	 credible 	 	 expansive 	 ness 	 	of	 ches 	 s 	 	--	there	are	more	ways	of	 fold 	 ing 	 	a	protein	than	there	are	 atom 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	world	-	changing	problem	with	huge	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	our	ability	to	understand	and	treat	disease	.
and	for	 th 	 is 	 	task	,	 super 	 computer 	 	field	brute	force	 simpl 	 y 	 	is	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	.
foldit	,	a	game	 create 	 d 	 	by	computer	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 illustr 	 ates 	 	the	value	of	the	approach	.
non	-	technical	,	non	-	biologist	 amateur 	 s 	 	play	a	video	game	in	which	they	 visual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 arrange 	 	the	structure	of	the	protein	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	computer	to	manage	the	atomic	 force 	 s 	 	and	 interact 	 ions 	 	and	identify	structural	 issue 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	approach	beat	 super 	 computer 	 s 	 	50	percent	of	the	time	and	 ti 	 ed 	 	30	percent	of	the	time	.
foldit	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	made	a	 not 	 able 	 	and	major	scientific	 discover 	 y 	 	by	 decipher 	 ing 	 	the	structure	of	the	mason	-	pfizer	monkey	virus	.
a	 pro 	 teas 	 e 	 	that	had	 elude 	 d 	 	 determi 	 nation 	 	for	over	10	 year 	 s 	 	was	 solve 	 d 	 	was	by	three	 player 	 s 	 	in	a	matter	of	 day 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	first	major	scientific	advance	to	come	from	 play 	 ing 	 	a	video	game	.
last	year	,	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	of	the	 t 	 win 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	,	the	9/11	memorial	 open 	 ed 	 	.
it	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 victim 	 s 	 	using	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 ad 	 ja 	 cency 	 	.	``
it	 place 	 s 	 	the	 name 	 s 	 	next	to	each	other	based	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	:	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	 co 	 work 	 ers 	 	.
when	you	put	it	all	together	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 computation 	 al 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	:	3,500	 victim 	 s 	 	,	1,800	 ad 	 ja 	 cency 	 	 request 	 s 	 	,	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	the	 over 	 all 	 	physical	 specific 	 ations 	 	and	the	final	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	.
when	first	 report 	 ed 	 	by	the	media	,	full	credit	for	 s 	 uch 	 	a	feat	was	 give 	 n 	 	to	an	algorithm	from	the	new	york	city	design	firm	local	 project 	 s 	 	.	the	truth	is	a	bit	more	 nuance 	 d 	 	.
while	an	algorithm	was	used	to	develop	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	,	 human 	 s 	 	used	that	 frame 	 work 	 	to	design	the	final	result	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	computer	had	 evaluate 	 d 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	possible	 lay 	 out 	 s 	 	,	 manage 	 d 	 	a	complex	 relation 	 al 	 	system	,	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	track	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	set	of	 measure 	 ments 	 	and	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	 human 	 s 	 	to	focus	on	design	and	 com 	 position 	 al 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	.
so	the	more	you	look	around	you	,	the	more	you	see	licklider	's	vision	 every 	 where 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	in	your	iphone	or	gps	in	your	car	,	human	-	computer	 sym 	 bio 	 sis 	 	is	making	us	more	 cap 	 able 	 	.
so	if	you	want	to	improve	human	-	computer	 sym 	 bio 	 sis 	 	,	what	can	you	do	?
you	can	start	by	 design 	 ing 	 	the	human	 in 	 to 	 	the	process	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	a	computer	will	do	to	solve	the	problem	,	design	the	solution	around	what	the	human	will	do	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
when	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	'll	 quick 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	that	you	 s 	 pent 	 	all	of	your	time	on	the	 inter 	 face 	 	between	man	and	machine	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	on	 design 	 ing 	 	away	the	friction	in	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	friction	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	the	power	of	the	man	or	the	power	of	the	machine	in	 determi 	 ning 	 	 over 	 all 	 	 cap 	 ability 	 	.
that	's	why	two	 amateur 	 s 	 	with	a	few	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	 hand 	 ily 	 	beat	a	 super 	 computer 	 	and	a	 grand 	 master 	 	.
what	kasparov	 call 	 s 	 	process	is	a	 by 	 product 	 	of	friction	.
the	better	the	process	,	the	less	the	friction	.
and	 minim 	 izing 	 	friction	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	the	 decis 	 ive 	 	 vari 	 able 	 	.
or	take	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	big	data	.
every	 interact 	 ion 	 	we	have	in	the	world	is	 record 	 ed 	 	by	an	ever	growing	array	of	 sensor 	 s 	 	:	your	phone	,	your	credit	card	,	your	computer	.	the	result	is	big	data	,	and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 present 	 s 	 	us	with	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	understand	the	human	condition	.
the	major	 emphas 	 is 	 	of	most	 approach 	 es 	 	to	big	data	focus	on	,	``	how	do	i	store	 th 	 is 	 	data	?	how	do	i	search	 th 	 is 	 	data	?	how	do	i	process	 th 	 is 	 	data	?	``
these	are	 necess 	 ary 	 	but	 in 	 sufficient 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
the	 imper 	 ative 	 	is	not	to	figure	out	how	to	compute	,	but	what	to	compute	.	how	do	you	impose	human	 intuit 	 ion 	 	on	data	at	 th 	 is 	 	scale	?
 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	start	by	 design 	 ing 	 	the	human	 in 	 to 	 	the	process	.
when	paypal	was	first	 start 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	business	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 big 	 gest 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	not	,	``	how	do	i	 s 	 end 	 	money	back	and	forth	 on 	 line 	 	?	``
it	was	,	``	how	do	i	do	that	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 de 	 fraud 	 ed 	 	by	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	?	``
why	so	 challeng 	 ing 	 	?	 be 	 cause 	 	while	 computer 	 s 	 	can	learn	to	detect	and	identify	fraud	based	on	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	they	ca	n't	learn	to	do	that	based	on	 pattern 	 s 	 	they	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	,	and	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	in	common	with	 th 	 is 	 	audience	:	 brilli 	 ant 	 	people	,	 relent 	 lessly 	 	 resource 	 ful 	 	,	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	spirit	--	--	and	one	huge	and	 import 	 ant 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	:	purpose	.
and	so	while	 computer 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	can	catch	all	but	the	 clever 	 est 	 	 fraud 	 sters 	 	,	 catch 	 ing 	 	the	 clever 	 est 	 	is	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	success	and	failure	.
there	's	a	whole	class	of	 problem 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 one 	 s 	 	with	 adapt 	 ive 	 	 advers 	 aries 	 	.	they	 rare 	 ly 	 	if	ever	present	with	a	 repeat 	 able 	 	pattern	that	's	 discern 	 able 	 	to	 computer 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	there	's	some	inherent	component	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	or	 disrupt 	 ion 	 	,	and	 increasing 	 ly 	 	these	 problem 	 s 	 	are	buried	in	big	data	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 terror 	 ism 	 	.	 terrorist 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 adapt 	 ing 	 	in	minor	and	major	ways	to	new	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	and	 de 	 spite 	 	what	you	might	see	on	tv	,	these	 adapt 	 ations 	 	,	and	the	 detect 	 ion 	 	of	them	,	are	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	human	.
 computer 	 s 	 	do	n't	detect	novel	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	new	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	but	 human 	 s 	 	do	.	 human 	 s 	 	,	using	technology	,	 test 	 ing 	 	 hypo 	 these 	 s 	 	,	 search 	 ing 	 	for	 in 	 sight 	 	by	 ask 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	for	them	.
osama	bin	laden	was	not	caught	by	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
he	was	caught	by	 dedicate 	 d 	 	,	 resource 	 ful 	 	,	 brilli 	 ant 	 	people	in	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	with	 vari 	 ous 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 appeal 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	might	sound	,	you	can	not	 algorithm 	 ically 	 	data	mine	your	way	to	the	answer	.
there	is	no	``	find	terrorist	``	button	,	and	the	more	data	we	integrate	from	a	vast	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 source 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	a	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	data	 format 	 s 	 	from	 ver 	 y 	 	disparate	 system 	 s 	 	,	the	less	effective	data	 min 	 ing 	 	can	be	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	people	will	have	to	look	at	data	and	search	for	 in 	 sight 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	licklider	 fore 	 saw 	 	long	ago	,	the	key	to	great	 result 	 s 	 	here	is	the	right	type	of	 co 	 operation 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	kasparov	 real 	 ized 	 	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 minim 	 izing 	 	friction	at	the	 inter 	 face 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	approach	 make 	 s 	 	possible	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 comb 	 ing 	 	through	all	 avail 	 able 	 	data	from	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 source 	 s 	 	,	 identify 	 ing 	 	key	 relationship 	 s 	 	and	 put 	 ting 	 	them	in	one	place	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	do	before	.

that	must	be	 acknowledg 	 ed 	 	,	and	they	ca	n't	be	 s 	 wept 	 	 a 	 side 	 	,	even	with	the	best	of	 intent 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	explore	,	through	a	couple	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	the	impact	that	 techno 	 logies 	 	built	to	drive	human	-	computer	 sym 	 bio 	 sis 	 	have	had	in	 re 	 cent 	 	time	.

the	human	goal	here	was	to	identify	 camp 	 s 	 	for	 re 	 location 	 	based	on	 prior 	 ity 	 	need	.
