two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	artist	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 commemo 	 rating 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	of	islamic	art	in	europe	.
the	 cur 	 ator 	 	had	 on 	 ly 	 	one	condition	:	i	had	to	use	the	arabic	script	for	my	 art 	 work 	 	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	artist	,	a	woman	,	an	arab	,	or	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	living	in	the	world	in	2010	,	i	 on 	 ly 	 	had	one	thing	to	say	:	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	no	.
and	in	arabic	,	to	say	``	no	,	``	we	say	``	no	,	and	a	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	no.	``
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	look	for	a	thousand	different	 no 	 es 	 	.
on	 every 	 thing 	 	ever	 produce 	 d 	 	under	islamic	or	arab	 patron 	 age 	 	in	the	past	1,400	 year 	 s 	 	,	from	spain	to	the	 border 	 s 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	.
i	 collect 	 ed 	 	my	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	a	book	,	 place 	 d 	 	them	 chrono 	 logically 	 	,	 stat 	 ing 	 	the	name	,	the	patron	,	the	medium	and	the	date	.
now	,	the	book	 s 	 at 	 	on	a	small	shelf	next	to	the	 install 	 ation 	 	,	which	stood	three	by	seven	 meter 	 s 	 	,	in	munich	,	germany	,	in	september	of	2010	.
now	,	in	january	,	2011	,	the	revolution	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	life	 stop 	 ped 	 	for	18	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	on	the	12th	of	february	,	we	 naive 	 ly 	 	 celebr 	 ated 	 	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	cairo	,	 believ 	 ing 	 	that	the	revolution	had	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
nine	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	 spray 	 ing 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	in	tahrir	square	.	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	act	was	 th 	 is 	 	image	that	i	saw	in	my	 news 	 feed 	 	.
i	did	not	feel	that	i	could	live	in	a	city	where	people	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	and	 throw 	 n 	 	like	garbage	on	the	street	.
so	i	took	one	``	no	``	off	a	 tomb 	 stone 	 	from	the	islamic	museum	in	cairo	,	and	i	 add 	 ed 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	to	it	:	``	no	to	 militar 	 y 	 	rule	.	``
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 spray 	 ing 	 	that	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	in	cairo	.
but	that	led	to	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	no	,	coming	out	of	the	book	like	 am 	 mun 	 ition 	 	,	and	 add 	 ing 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	to	them	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 spray 	 ing 	 	them	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'll	be	sharing	some	of	these	 no 	 es 	 	with	you	.
no	to	a	new	pharaoh	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 who 	 ever 	 	 come 	 s 	 	next	should	understand	that	we	will	never	be	 rul 	 ed 	 	by	 an 	 other 	 	dictator	.
no	to	violence	:	ramy	essam	came	to	tahrir	on	the	second	day	of	the	revolution	,	and	he	 s 	 at 	 	there	with	 th 	 is 	 	guitar	,	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	.
one	month	after	mubarak	 steppe 	 d 	 	down	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	his	reward	.
no	to	 blind 	 ing 	 	heroes	.	ahmed	harara	lost	his	right	eye	on	the	28th	of	january	,	and	he	lost	his	left	eye	on	the	19th	of	november	,	by	two	different	 snip 	 ers 	 	.
no	to	 kill 	 ing 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	no	to	 kill 	 ing 	 	men	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	sheikh	ahmed	adina	refaat	was	shot	on	december	16th	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	 demonst 	 ration 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	three	 orphan 	 s 	 	and	a	widow	.
no	to	 burn 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.	the	institute	of	egypt	was	 burn 	 ed 	 	on	december	17th	,	a	huge	cultural	loss	.
no	to	 strip 	 ping 	 	the	people	,	and	the	blue	bra	is	to	 re 	 mind 	 	us	of	our	shame	 a 	 s 	 	a	nation	when	we	allow	a	 veil 	 ed 	 	woman	to	be	 strip 	 ped 	 	and	 beat 	 en 	 	on	the	street	,	and	the	 foot 	 print 	 	 read 	 s 	 	,	``	long	live	a	 peace 	 ful 	 	revolution	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	we	will	never	 retali 	 ate 	 	with	violence	.
no	to	 bar 	 rier 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	.	on	february	5th	,	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 road 	 block 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	set	up	in	cairo	to	protect	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	defense	from	 protest 	 ers 	 	.
now	,	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	 wall 	 s 	 	,	i	want	to	share	with	you	the	story	of	one	wall	in	cairo	.
a	group	of	 artist 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	paint	a	life	-	 s 	 ize 	 	tank	on	a	wall	.	it	's	one	to	one	.
in	front	of	 th 	 is 	 	tank	there	's	a	man	on	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	with	a	 bread 	 basket 	 	on	his	head	.	to	any	 pass 	 er 	 by 	 	,	there	's	no	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	visual	.
after	 act 	 s 	 	of	violence	,	 an 	 other 	 	artist	came	,	 paint 	 ed 	 	blood	,	 protest 	 ers 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	run	over	by	the	tank	,	 demonst 	 rator 	 s 	 	,	and	a	 mess 	 age 	 	that	read	,	``	 start 	 ing 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	i	wear	the	new	face	,	the	face	of	every	martyr	.	i	exist	.	``
 author 	 ity 	 	 come 	 s 	 	,	 paint 	 s 	 	the	wall	white	,	 leav 	 es 	 	the	tank	and	 add 	 s 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	:	``	 arm 	 y 	 	and	people	,	one	hand	.	egypt	for	egyptians	.	``
 an 	 other 	 	artist	 come 	 s 	 	,	 paint 	 s 	 	the	head	of	the	 militar 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mon 	 ster 	 	eating	a	maiden	in	a	river	of	blood	in	front	of	the	tank	.

so	i	come	with	my	 sten 	 cil 	 s 	 	,	and	i	spray	them	on	the	suit	,	on	the	tank	,	and	on	the	whole	wall	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	 stand 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 un 	 til 	 	further	notice	.
now	,	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	a	final	no	.
i	found	neruda	 s 	 crib 	 bled 	 	on	a	piece	of	paper	in	a	field	hospital	in	tahrir	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	a	no	of	mamluk	 ma 	 us 	 oleum 	 	in	cairo	.
