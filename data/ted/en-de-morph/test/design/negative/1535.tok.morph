we	're	going	to	begin	in	1964	.
bob	dylan	is	23	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	his	 care 	 er 	 	is	just	 reach 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	pinnacle	.
he	's	 be 	 en 	 	 christen 	 ed 	 	the	voice	of	a	generation	,	and	he	's	 churn 	 ing 	 	out	classic	 song 	 s 	 	at	a	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	rate	,	but	there	's	a	small	 minor 	 ity 	 	of	 dis 	 s 	 enter 	 s 	 	,	and	they	claim	that	bob	dylan	is	 steal 	 ing 	 	other	people	's	 song 	 s 	 	.
2004	.	brian	burton	,	aka	danger	mouse	,	 take 	 s 	 	the	beatles	'	``	white	 al 	 bum 	 	,	``	 combine 	 s 	 	it	with	jay	-	z	's	``	the	black	 al 	 bum 	 	``	to	create	``	the	 gr 	 ey 	 	 al 	 bum 	 	.	``
``	the	 gr 	 ey 	 	 al 	 bum 	 	``	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	 im 	 mediate 	 	 sens 	 ation 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	the	beatles	'	record	company	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	out	 count 	 less 	 	cease	-	and	-	desist	 letter 	 s 	 	for	``	 un 	 fair 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	and	 dil 	 ution 	 	of	our	 valu 	 able 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	.	``
now	,	``	the	 gr 	 ey 	 	 al 	 bum 	 	``	is	a	remix	.
it	is	new	media	 create 	 d 	 	from	old	media	.
it	was	made	using	these	three	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	:	copy	,	transform	and	combine	.
it	's	how	you	remix	.	you	take	 exist 	 ing 	 	 song 	 s 	 	,	you	chop	them	up	,	you	transform	the	 piece 	 s 	 	,	you	combine	them	back	together	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	you	've	got	a	new	song	,	but	that	new	song	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	of	old	 song 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	these	are	n't	just	the	 component 	 s 	 	of	 remix 	 ing 	 	.
i	think	these	are	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 element 	 s 	 	of	all	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
i	think	 every 	 thing 	 	is	a	remix	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	better	way	to	 conceiv 	 e 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
all	right	,	let	's	head	back	to	1964	,	and	let	's	hear	where	some	of	dylan	's	early	 song 	 s 	 	came	from	.
we	'll	do	some	side	-	by	-	side	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	here	.
all	right	,	 th 	 is 	 	first	song	you	're	going	to	hear	is	``	nottamun	town	.	``	it	's	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	folk	tune	.
after	that	,	you	'll	hear	dylan	's	``	 master 	 s 	 	of	war	.	``
jean	ritchie	:	♫	in	nottamun	town	,	not	a	soul	would	look	out	,	♫	♫	not	a	soul	would	look	up	,	not	a	soul	would	look	down	.	♫	bob	dylan	:	♫	come	you	 master 	 s 	 	of	war	,	♫	♫	you	that	build	the	big	 gun 	 s 	 	,	you	that	build	the	death	 plane 	 s 	 	,	♫	♫	you	that	build	all	the	 bomb 	 s 	 	.	♫	kirby	ferguson	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	that	's	the	same	 bas 	 ic 	 	 melo 	 dy 	 	and	 over 	 all 	 	structure	.	 th 	 is 	 	next	one	is	``	the	patriot	game	,	``	by	dominic	behan	.	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	that	,	you	're	going	to	hear	``	with	god	on	our	side	,	``	by	dylan	.
dominic	behan	:	♫	come	all	ye	young	 rebel 	 s 	 	,	♫	♫	and	list	while	i	 s 	 ing 	 	,	♫	♫	for	the	love	of	one	's	land	is	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	.	♫	bd	:	♫	oh	my	name	it	is	nothin	'	,	♫	♫	my	age	it	 mean 	 s 	 	less	,	♫	♫	the	country	i	come	from	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 mid 	 west 	 	.	♫	kf	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	dylan	 admit 	 s 	 	he	must	have	heard	``	the	patriot	game	,	``	he	 for 	 got 	 	about	it	,	then	when	the	song	kind	of	 bubble 	 d 	 	back	up	in	his	brain	,	he	just	thought	it	was	his	song	.
last	one	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	``	who	's	going	to	buy	you	 ribbon 	 s 	 	,	``	 an 	 other 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	folk	tune	.
 a 	 long 	 side 	 	that	is	``	do	n't	think	twice	,	it	's	all	right	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	one	's	more	about	the	lyric	.
paul	clayton	:	♫	it	ai	n't	no	use	to	 s 	 it 	 	and	 sig 	 h 	 	now	,	♫	♫	 darl 	 in 	 	'	,	and	it	ai	n't	no	use	to	 s 	 it 	 	and	cry	now	.	♫	bd	:	♫	it	ai	n't	no	use	to	 s 	 it 	 	and	wonder	why	,	 bab 	 e 	 	,	♫	♫	if	you	do	n't	know	by	now	,	♫	♫	and	it	ai	n't	no	use	to	 s 	 it 	 	and	wonder	why	,	 bab 	 e 	 	,	♫	♫	it	'll	never	do	 some 	 how 	 	.	♫	kf	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	,	there	's	a	lot	of	these	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	two	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	 melo 	 dies 	 	dylan	used	in	his	early	 song 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 borrow 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	typical	among	folk	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	.
here	's	the	 ad 	 vice 	 	of	dylan	's	idol	,	 wood 	 y 	 	guthrie	.
``	the	 world 	 s 	 	are	the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	.
do	n't	worry	about	 tune 	 s 	 	.	take	a	tune	,	 s 	 ing 	 	high	when	they	 s 	 ing 	 	low	,	 s 	 ing 	 	fast	when	they	 s 	 ing 	 	 s 	 low 	 	,	and	you	've	got	a	new	tune	.	``
and	that	's	,	that	's	what	guthrie	did	right	here	,	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	all	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
we	know	 th 	 is 	 	tune	,	right	?	we	know	it	?
 actual 	 ly 	 	you	do	n't	.
that	is	``	when	the	world	's	on	fire	,	``	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	 melo 	 dy 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	 perform 	 ed 	 	by	the	carter	family	.
guthrie	 adapt 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	``	 th 	 is 	 	land	is	your	land	.	``
so	,	bob	dylan	,	like	all	folk	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	,	he	 cop 	 ied 	 	 melo 	 dies 	 	,	he	 transform 	 ed 	 	them	,	he	 combine 	 d 	 	them	with	new	 lyric 	 s 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	 frequent 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 concoct 	 ion 	 	of	previous	stuff	.
now	,	american	 copy 	 right 	 	and	patent	 law 	 s 	 	run	counter	to	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	that	we	build	on	the	work	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	these	 law 	 s 	 	and	 law 	 s 	 	around	the	world	use	the	 ra 	 ther 	 	awkward	 analog 	 y 	 	of	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
now	,	creative	 work 	 s 	 	may	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	be	kind	of	like	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	but	it	's	 proper 	 ty 	 	that	we	're	all	building	on	,	and	 creation 	 s 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	take	root	and	grow	once	that	ground	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	prepared	.

it	's	the	same	animal	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	.
let	's	hear	what	jeff	han	 ha 	 s 	 	to	say	about	 th 	 is 	 	 new 	 fang 	 led 	 	technology	.
jeff	han	:	multi	-	touch	 sens 	 ing 	 	is	n't	 any 	 thing 	 	--	is	n't	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	.	i	mean	,	people	like	bill	buxton	have	 be 	 en 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	around	with	it	in	the	'80s	.

kf	:	so	he	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	frank	about	it	not	 be 	 ing 	 	new	.
so	it	's	not	multi	-	touch	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	that	's	 patent 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	the	small	 part 	 s 	 	of	it	that	are	,	and	it	's	in	these	small	 detail 	 s 	 	where	we	can	 clear 	 ly 	 	see	patent	law	 contradict 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	intent	:	to	promote	the	progress	of	 use 	 ful 	 	 art 	 s 	 	.

now	,	can	 some 	 one 	 	own	 th 	 is 	 	idea	?
now	,	back	in	the	'80s	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 soft 	 ware 	 	 patent 	 s 	 	,	and	it	was	xerox	that	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	the	graphical	user	 inter 	 face 	 	.

and	we	have	,	you	know	,	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 shame 	 less 	 	about	 steal 	 ing 	 	great	 idea 	 s 	 	.
kf	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	that	's	in	'96	.	here	's	in	2010	.

1983	.	bob	dylan	is	42	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	his	time	in	the	cultural	 spot 	 light 	 	is	long	since	past	.
he	 record 	 s 	 	a	song	 call 	 ed 	 	``	blind	willie	mctell	,	``	named	after	the	 blue 	 s 	 	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	,	and	the	song	is	a	voyage	through	the	past	,	through	a	much	 dark 	 er 	 	time	,	but	a	 simpl 	 er 	 	one	,	a	time	when	 music 	 ians 	 	like	willie	mctell	had	few	 illusion 	 s 	 	about	what	they	did	.
``	i	jump	'	em	from	other	 writer 	 s 	 	but	i	arrange	'	em	my	own	way	.	``
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 most 	 ly 	 	what	we	do	.
our	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	 with 	 out 	 	,	not	from	 with 	 in 	 	.
we	are	not	self	-	made	.	we	are	dependent	on	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	 admit 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	is	n't	an	embrace	of	 mediocr 	 ity 	 	and	derivativeness	.
it	's	a	 liber 	 ation 	 	from	our	 mis 	 conception 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	an	incentive	to	not	expect	so	much	from	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	to	 simpl 	 y 	 	begin	.
