i	'm	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	,	and	i	 stud 	 y 	 	decision	-	making	.
i	do	 experiment 	 s 	 	to	test	how	different	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	influence	the	 choice 	 s 	 	we	make	.
i	'm	here	to	tell	you	the	secret	to	 success 	 ful 	 	decision	-	making	:	a	cheese	sandwich	.
that	's	right	.	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	a	cheese	sandwich	is	the	solution	to	all	your	tough	 decision 	 s 	 	.
how	do	i	know	?	i	'm	the	scientist	who	did	the	 stud 	 y 	 	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	a	brain	chemical	 call 	 ed 	 	serotonin	would	influence	people	's	 decision 	 s 	 	in	social	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
 specific 	 ally 	 	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	how	serotonin	would	affect	the	way	people	react	when	they	're	 treat 	 ed 	 	 un 	 fair 	 ly 	 	.
so	we	did	an	experiment	.
we	 manipul 	 ated 	 	people	's	serotonin	 level 	 s 	 	by	giving	them	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 disgust 	 ing 	 	-	tasting	artificial	lemon	-	 flavor 	 ed 	 	drink	that	 work 	 s 	 	by	taking	away	the	raw	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	for	serotonin	in	the	brain	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 am 	 ino 	 	acid	 try 	 ptophan 	 	.
so	what	we	found	was	,	when	 try 	 ptophan 	 	was	low	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	take	 re 	 venge 	 	when	they	're	 treat 	 ed 	 	 un 	 fair 	 ly 	 	.
that	's	the	 stud 	 y 	 	we	did	,	and	here	are	some	of	the	 head 	 lines 	 	that	came	out	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	you	might	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	did	i	 mis 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	?
cheese	?	chocolate	?	where	did	that	come	from	?
and	i	thought	the	same	thing	 my 	 self 	 	when	these	came	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 stud 	 y 	 	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	cheese	or	chocolate	.
we	 g 	 ave 	 	people	 th 	 is 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	-	tasting	drink	that	 affect 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 try 	 ptophan 	 	 level 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 try 	 ptophan 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	found	in	cheese	and	chocolate	.
and	of	course	when	science	 say 	 s 	 	cheese	and	chocolate	help	you	make	better	 decision 	 s 	 	,	well	,	that	's	 s 	 ure 	 	to	grab	people	's	attention	.
so	there	you	have	it	:	the	evolution	of	a	 head 	 line 	 	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	a	part	of	me	thought	,	well	,	what	's	the	big	deal	?
so	the	media	 over 	 simpl 	 ified 	 	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	in	the	end	,	it	's	just	a	news	story	.
and	i	think	a	lot	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	attitude	.
but	the	problem	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	all	the	time	,	and	it	 affect 	 s 	 	not	just	the	 st 	 ories 	 	you	read	in	the	news	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	 product 	 s 	 	you	see	on	the	 shelv 	 es 	 	.
when	the	 head 	 lines 	 	 roll 	 ed 	 	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	the	 market 	 ers 	 	came	 call 	 ing 	 	.
would	i	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	provide	a	scientific	 endorse 	 ment 	 	of	a	mood	-	 boost 	 ing 	 	 bottle 	 d 	 	water	?
or	would	i	go	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	,	in	front	of	a	live	audience	,	that	comfort	 food 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	make	you	feel	better	?
i	think	these	 folk 	 s 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	well	,	but	had	i	taken	them	up	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 ers 	 	,	i	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	going	beyond	the	science	,	and	good	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 care 	 ful 	 	not	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	 neuro 	 science 	 	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	up	more	and	more	in	 market 	 ing 	 	.
here	's	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	neuro	 drink 	 s 	 	,	a	line	of	 product 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	nuero	 bli 	 s 	 s 	 	here	,	which	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	label	 help 	 s 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	stress	,	 enhance 	 s 	 	mood	,	 provide 	 s 	 	focused	 concent 	 ration 	 	,	and	 promote 	 s 	 	a	positive	 out 	 look 	 	.
i	have	to	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	awesome	.
i	could	 total 	 ly 	 	have	used	 th 	 is 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	when	 th 	 is 	 	came	up	in	my	local	shop	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	i	was	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	some	of	the	research	 back 	 ing 	 	these	 claim 	 s 	 	.
so	i	went	to	the	company	's	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	looking	to	find	some	controlled	 trial 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
but	i	did	n't	find	any	.
trial	or	no	trial	,	these	 claim 	 s 	 	are	front	and	center	on	 the 	 ir 	 	label	right	next	to	a	picture	of	a	brain	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 brain 	 s 	 	have	special	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
a	couple	of	 research 	 ers 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	few	hundred	people	to	read	a	scientific	article	.
for	half	the	people	,	the	article	 include 	 d 	 	a	brain	image	,	and	for	the	other	half	,	it	was	the	same	article	but	it	did	n't	have	a	brain	image	.
at	the	end	--	you	see	where	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	--	people	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 agree 	 d 	 	with	the	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	of	the	article	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	much	people	agree	with	the	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	with	no	image	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	much	they	agree	with	the	same	article	that	did	include	a	brain	image	.
so	the	take	-	home	 mess 	 age 	 	here	is	,	do	you	want	to	sell	it	?	put	a	brain	on	it	.
now	let	me	pause	here	and	take	a	moment	to	say	that	 neuro 	 science 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	a	lot	in	the	last	few	 decade 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	 constant 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ing 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	brain	.
like	,	just	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	at	mit	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	break	 habit 	 s 	 	in	 rat 	 s 	 	just	by	 controll 	 ing 	 	neural	activity	in	a	specific	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	.
 re 	 ally 	 	cool	stuff	.
but	the	promise	of	 neuro 	 science 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	some	 re 	 ally 	 	high	 expect 	 ations 	 	and	some	 over 	 blown 	 	,	 un 	 proven 	 	 claim 	 s 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	show	you	how	to	spot	a	couple	of	classic	 move 	 s 	 	,	dead	 give 	 away 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	for	what	's	 vari 	 ously 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	neuro	-	bunk	,	neuro	-	 bol 	 lock 	 s 	 	,	or	,	my	personal	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	neuro	-	flapdoodle	.
so	the	first	 un 	 proven 	 	claim	is	that	you	can	use	brain	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	to	read	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
here	's	a	 stud 	 y 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	by	a	team	of	 research 	 ers 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	op	-	ed	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	.
the	 head 	 line 	 	?	``	you	love	your	iphone	.	 liter 	 ally 	 	.	``
it	 quick 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	most	 email 	 ed 	 	article	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
so	how	'd	they	figure	 th 	 is 	 	out	?
they	put	16	people	 in 	 side 	 	a	brain	scanner	and	 show 	 ed 	 	them	 video 	 s 	 	of	 ring 	 ing 	 	iphones	.
the	brain	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	 activ 	 ation 	 	in	a	part	of	the	brain	 call 	 ed 	 	the	insula	,	a	region	they	say	is	linked	to	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	love	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
so	they	 conclude 	 d 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	they	saw	 activ 	 ation 	 	in	the	insula	,	 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	the	 subject 	 s 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	iphones	.
now	there	's	just	one	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	line	of	 reason 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	's	that	the	insula	 do 	 es 	 	a	lot	.
 s 	 ure 	 	,	it	is	 involve 	 d 	 	in	positive	 emotion 	 s 	 	like	love	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 ton 	 s 	 	of	other	 process 	 es 	 	,	like	 memor 	 y 	 	,	language	,	attention	,	even	anger	,	disgust	and	pain	.
so	based	on	the	same	logic	,	i	could	 equal 	 ly 	 	conclude	you	hate	your	iphone	.
the	point	here	is	,	when	you	see	 activ 	 ation 	 	in	the	insula	,	you	ca	n't	just	pick	and	 choos 	 e 	 	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	from	off	 th 	 is 	 	list	,	and	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	list	.
my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	tal	yarkoni	and	russ	poldrack	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	the	insula	 pop 	 s 	 	up	in	 al 	 most 	 	a	third	of	all	brain	 im 	 aging 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	have	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
so	 chance 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	good	that	your	insula	is	going	off	right	now	,	but	i	wo	n't	kid	 my 	 self 	 	to	think	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	you	love	me	.
so	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	love	and	the	brain	,	there	's	a	 research 	 er 	 	,	known	to	some	 a 	 s 	 	dr.	love	,	who	 claim 	 s 	 	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	found	the	glue	that	 hold 	 s 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	together	,	the	source	of	love	and	 prosper 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	it	's	not	a	cheese	sandwich	.
no	,	it	's	a	hormone	 call 	 ed 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	.
you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	of	it	.
so	,	dr.	love	 base 	 s 	 	his	argument	on	 stud 	 ies 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	that	when	you	boost	people	's	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	trust	,	 empath 	 y 	 	and	 co 	 operation 	 	.
so	he	's	 call 	 ing 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	``	the	moral	molecule	.	``
now	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	are	 scientific 	 ally 	 	valid	,	and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 replicate 	 d 	 	,	but	they	're	not	the	whole	story	.
other	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	 boost 	 ing 	 	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 en 	 vy 	 	.	it	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 gl 	 o 	 ating 	 	.
 oxy 	 tocin 	 	can	bias	people	to	favor	 the 	 ir 	 	own	group	at	the	expense	of	other	 group 	 s 	 	.
and	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	can	even	 de 	 crease 	 	 co 	 operation 	 	.
so	based	on	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	i	could	say	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	is	an	immoral	molecule	,	and	call	 my 	 self 	 	dr.	strangelove	.
so	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	neuro	-	flapdoodle	all	over	the	 head 	 lines 	 	.
we	see	it	in	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	,	on	book	 cover 	 s 	 	.
what	about	the	clinic	?
spect	 im 	 aging 	 	is	a	brain	-	 s 	 canning 	 	technology	that	uses	a	 radio 	 active 	 	 trac 	 er 	 	to	track	blood	flow	in	the	brain	.
for	the	 bar 	 gain 	 	price	of	a	few	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 clinic 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	that	will	give	you	one	of	these	spect	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	and	use	the	image	to	help	 diagnos 	 e 	 	your	 problem 	 s 	 	.
these	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	,	the	 clinic 	 s 	 	say	,	can	help	prevent	alzheimer	's	disease	,	solve	weight	and	 addict 	 ion 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 over 	 come 	 	marital	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	and	treat	,	of	course	,	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	ranging	from	 depress 	 ion 	 	to	 anxie 	 ty 	 	to	adhd	.
 th 	 is 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	great	.	a	lot	of	people	agree	.
some	of	these	 clinic 	 s 	 	are	 pull 	 ing 	 	in	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	in	business	.
there	's	just	one	problem	.
the	broad	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	in	 neuro 	 science 	 	is	that	we	ca	n't	yet	 diagnos 	 e 	 	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	from	a	single	brain	 s 	 can 	 	.
but	these	 clinic 	 s 	 	have	 treat 	 ed 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	to	date	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	children	,	and	spect	 im 	 aging 	 	 involve 	 s 	 	a	 radio 	 active 	 	 inject 	 ion 	 	,	so	 ex 	 posing 	 	people	to	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	 harm 	 ful 	 	.
i	am	more	 excit 	 ed 	 	than	most	people	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	,	about	the	potential	for	 neuro 	 science 	 	to	treat	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	and	even	 may 	 be 	 	to	make	us	better	and	 smart 	 er 	 	.
and	if	one	day	we	can	say	that	cheese	and	chocolate	help	us	make	better	 decision 	 s 	 	,	count	me	in	.
but	we	're	not	there	yet	.
we	have	n't	found	a	``	buy	``	button	 in 	 side 	 	the	brain	,	we	ca	n't	tell	 whet 	 her 	 	 some 	 one 	 	is	 ly 	 ing 	 	or	in	love	just	by	looking	at	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	,	and	we	ca	n't	turn	 s 	 inner 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 saint 	 s 	 	with	 hormone 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	 some 	 day 	 	we	will	,	but	 un 	 til 	 	then	,	we	have	to	be	 care 	 ful 	 	that	we	do	n't	let	 over 	 blown 	 	 claim 	 s 	 	 de 	 tract 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	and	attention	away	from	the	real	science	that	's	 play 	 ing 	 	a	much	 long 	 er 	 	game	.
so	here	's	where	you	come	in	.
if	 some 	 one 	 	tries	to	sell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	with	a	brain	on	it	,	do	n't	just	take	them	at	 the 	 ir 	 	word	.
ask	the	tough	 question 	 s 	 	.	ask	to	see	the	evidence	.
ask	for	the	part	of	the	story	that	's	not	 be 	 ing 	 	told	.
the	 answer 	 s 	 	should	n't	be	simple	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	brain	is	n't	simple	.
but	that	's	not	 stop 	 ping 	 	us	from	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	it	out	 any 	 way 	 	.
thank	you	.
