caitria	o'neill	:	that	was	me	in	front	of	our	house	in	monson	,	massachusetts	last	june	.
after	an	ef	3	tornado	 rip 	 ped 	 	straight	through	our	town	and	took	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	roof	off	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	stay	in	massachusetts	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 pur 	 suing 	 	the	master	's	program	i	had	 move 	 d 	 	my	boxes	home	that	afternoon	for	.

and	now	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	change	the	experience	.
co	:	so	 tornado 	 es 	 	do	n't	happen	in	massachusetts	.
and	i	was	 clever 	 ly 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	front	yard	when	one	came	over	the	hill	.
after	a	 lamp 	 post 	 	flew	by	,	my	family	and	i	 s 	 print 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 base 	 ment 	 	.
 tree 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	against	the	house	,	the	 window 	 s 	 	 explode 	 d 	 	.
when	we	 final 	 ly 	 	got	out	the	back	door	,	 transform 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	in	the	street	.
mo	:	so	i	was	here	in	boston	.
i	'm	a	phd	student	at	mit	,	and	i	happen	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	science	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	 weird 	 er 	 	.
so	i	was	in	the	museum	of	science	at	the	time	the	tornado	hit	,	 play 	 ing 	 	with	the	tornado	 dis 	 play 	 	.
so	i	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	her	call	.
so	i	get	the	call	from	caitria	,	i	hear	the	news	,	and	i	start	 track 	 ing 	 	the	radar	 on 	 line 	 	to	call	the	family	back	when	 an 	 other 	 	 super 	 cell 	 	was	 form 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	area	.
and	i	drove	home	late	that	night	with	 batt 	 eries 	 	and	ice	.
we	live	 a 	 cross 	 	the	street	from	an	historic	church	that	had	lost	 it 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 icon 	 ic 	 	 steep 	 le 	 	in	the	storm	.
it	had	 be 	 come 	 	a	community	 gather 	 ing 	 	place	 over 	 night 	 	.
the	town	hall	and	the	police	 depart 	 ment 	 	had	 al 	 so 	 	 suffer 	 ed 	 	direct	 hit 	 s 	 	,	and	so	people	 want 	 ing 	 	to	help	or	 need 	 ing 	 	information	went	to	the	church	.
co	:	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	church	 be 	 cause 	 	we	heard	that	they	had	hot	 meal 	 s 	 	,	but	when	we	 arriv 	 ed 	 	we	found	 problem 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	a	couple	large	,	 sweat 	 y 	 	men	with	 chain 	 saw 	 s 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	center	of	the	church	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	where	to	 s 	 end 	 	them	 be 	 cause 	 	no	one	 k 	 new 	 	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	of	the	damage	yet	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 watch 	 ed 	 	,	they	 be 	 came 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	and	left	to	go	find	 some 	 body 	 	to	help	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
mo	:	so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 organ 	 izing 	 	.
why	?	it	had	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.	we	found	pastor	bob	and	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	give	the	 respons 	 e 	 	some	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
and	then	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	just	two	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	and	one	aircard	,	we	built	a	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	machine	.
co	:	that	was	a	tornado	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	's	 head 	 ing 	 	to	the	church	to	drop	 thing 	 s 	 	off	and	volunteer	.
mo	:	 every 	 one 	 	's	 don 	 ating 	 	 cloth 	 ing 	 	.
we	should	 re 	 ally 	 	 inventor 	 y 	 	the	 don 	 ations 	 	that	are	 pil 	 ing 	 	up	here	.
co	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	and	we	need	a	 hot 	 line 	 	.	can	you	make	a	google	voice	number	?
mo	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 	.	and	we	need	to	tell	people	what	not	to	 br 	 ing 	 	.
i	'll	make	a	facebook	account	.	can	you	print	 fli 	 ers 	 	for	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	?
co	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	even	know	what	 house 	 s 	 	are	 accept 	 ing 	 	help	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
we	need	to	canvas	and	 s 	 end 	 	out	 volunteer 	 s 	 	.
mo	:	we	need	to	tell	people	what	not	to	 br 	 ing 	 	.
 he 	 y 	 	,	there	's	a	news	truck	.	i	'll	tell	them	.
co	:	you	got	my	number	off	the	news	?
we	do	n't	need	any	more	 freeze 	 rs 	 	.
mo	:	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	wo	n't	cover	it	?	you	need	a	crew	to	tar	your	roof	?	co	:	six	 pack 	 s 	 	of	juice	boxes	 arriv 	 ing 	 	in	one	hour	?
together	:	 some 	 one 	 	get	me	post	-	 it 	 s 	 	!
co	:	and	then	the	rest	of	the	community	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	we	had	 answer 	 s 	 	.
mo	:	i	can	 don 	 ate 	 	three	water	 heat 	 ers 	 	,	but	 some 	 one 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	come	pick	them	up	.
co	:	my	car	is	in	my	living	room	.
mo	:	my	 boy 	 scout 	 	troop	would	like	to	 re 	 build 	 	12	 mail 	 boxes 	 	.
co	:	the	puppy	's	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	and	 insur 	 ance 	 	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cover	the	 chimney 	 s 	 	.
mo	:	my	church	group	of	50	would	like	housing	and	 meal 	 s 	 	for	a	week	while	we	repair	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
co	:	you	 s 	 ent 	 	me	to	that	place	on	washington	street	 yester 	 day 	 	,	and	now	i	'm	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	poison	 iv 	 y 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 fill 	 ed 	 	our	 day 	 s 	 	.
we	had	to	learn	how	to	answer	 question 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	and	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	in	about	a	minute	or	less	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 urge 	 nt 	 	would	come	up	,	and	it	just	would	n't	get	 d 	 one 	 	.
mo	:	we	did	n't	get	our	 author 	 ity 	 	from	the	board	of	 select 	 men 	 	or	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	management	director	or	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	way	.
we	just	 start 	 ed 	 	 answer 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	and	making	 decision 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 one 	 	,	 any 	 one 	 	,	had	to	.
and	why	not	me	?	i	'm	a	campaign	 organize 	 r 	 	.
i	'm	good	at	facebook	.
and	there	's	two	of	me	.
co	:	the	point	is	,	if	there	's	a	flood	or	a	fire	or	a	hurricane	,	you	,	or	 some 	 body 	 	like	you	,	are	going	to	step	up	and	start	 organ 	 izing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	other	point	is	that	it	is	hard	.
mo	:	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	the	ground	after	 an 	 other 	 	17	-	hour	day	,	caitria	and	i	would	empty	our	 pocket 	 s 	 	and	try	to	place	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 scrap 	 s 	 	of	paper	 in 	 to 	 	 con 	 text 	 	--	all	bits	of	information	that	had	to	be	 remember 	 ed 	 	and	 match 	 ed 	 	in	order	to	help	 some 	 one 	 	.
after	 an 	 other 	 	day	and	a	shower	at	the	shelter	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	it	should	n't	be	 th 	 is 	 	hard	.
co	:	in	a	country	like	 our 	 s 	 	where	we	breathe	wi	-	fi	,	 lever 	 aging 	 	technology	for	a	 fast 	 er 	 	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	should	be	a	no	-	 brain 	 er 	 	.
 system 	 s 	 	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	creating	on	the	fly	could	exist	 a 	 head 	 	of	time	.
and	if	some	community	member	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 izing 	 	position	in	every	area	after	every	disaster	,	these	 tool 	 s 	 	should	exist	.
mo	:	so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	build	them	--	a	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	in	a	box	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	be	 deploy 	 ed 	 	after	every	disaster	by	any	local	 organize 	 r 	 	.
co	:	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	stay	in	the	country	,	give	up	the	master	's	in	moscow	and	to	work	full	-	time	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	happen	.
in	the	course	of	the	past	year	,	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	in	the	field	of	community	-	powered	disaster	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
and	there	are	three	main	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 observ 	 ed 	 	with	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	work	 current 	 ly 	 	.
mo	:	the	 tool 	 s 	 	.	large	aid	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	are	 exception 	 al 	 	at	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	massive	 resource 	 s 	 	to	bear	after	a	disaster	,	but	they	often	fulfill	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 mission 	 s 	 	and	then	they	 leav 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	local	 resident 	 s 	 	to	deal	with	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 spontane 	 ous 	 	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 don 	 ations 	 	,	and	all	with	no	training	and	no	 tool 	 s 	 	.
so	they	use	post	-	 it 	 s 	 	or	excel	or	facebook	.
but	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 tool 	 s 	 	allow	you	to	value	high	-	 prior 	 ity 	 	information	 a 	 mid 	 st 	 	all	of	the	 photo 	 s 	 	and	well	 wish 	 es 	 	.
co	:	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	.
disaster	relief	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	campaign	.
in	a	 politic 	 al 	 	campaign	,	you	start	with	no	interest	and	no	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	turn	that	 in 	 to 	 	action	.
you	build	both	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 un 	 til 	 	a	moment	of	peak	 mobil 	 ization 	 	at	the	time	of	the	election	.
in	a	disaster	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	you	start	with	all	of	the	interest	and	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
and	you	've	 on 	 ly 	 	got	about	seven	 day 	 s 	 	to	capture	50	percent	of	all	of	the	web	 search 	 es 	 	that	will	ever	be	made	to	help	your	area	.
then	some	 s 	 port 	 ing 	 	event	 happen 	 s 	 	,	and	you	've	got	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 resource 	 s 	 	that	you	've	 collect 	 ed 	 	thus	far	to	meet	the	next	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	 need 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	slide	for	katrina	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 curv 	 e 	 	for	joplin	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 curv 	 e 	 	for	the	dallas	 tornado 	 es 	 	in	april	where	we	 deploy 	 ed 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
there	's	a	gap	here	.
 affect 	 ed 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	have	to	wait	for	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	 adjust 	 er 	 	to	visit	before	they	can	start	 accept 	 ing 	 	help	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
and	you	've	 on 	 ly 	 	got	about	four	 day 	 s 	 	of	interest	in	dallas	.
mo	:	data	.
data	is	 inherent 	 ly 	 	 un 	 sexy 	 	,	but	it	can	 jump 	 start 	 	an	area	's	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
fema	and	the	state	will	pay	85	percent	of	the	cost	of	a	 federal 	 ly 	 	 declare 	 d 	 	disaster	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	town	to	pay	last	15	percent	of	the	bill	.
now	that	expense	can	be	huge	,	but	if	the	town	can	mobilize	x	amount	of	 volunteer 	 s 	 	for	y	 hour 	 s 	 	,	the	dollar	value	of	that	labor	used	 go 	 es 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	town	's	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	.
but	who	 know 	 s 	 	that	?
now	try	to	imagine	the	 sink 	 ing 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	you	get	when	you	've	just	 s 	 ent 	 	out	2,000	 volunteer 	 s 	 	and	you	ca	n't	prove	it	.
co	:	these	are	three	 problem 	 s 	 	with	a	common	solution	.
if	we	can	get	the	right	 tool 	 s 	 	at	the	right	time	to	the	people	who	will	 inevit 	 ably 	 	step	up	and	start	 put 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	back	together	,	we	can	create	new	 standard 	 s 	 	in	disaster	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
mo	:	we	 need 	 ed 	 	 canvas 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	,	 don 	 ations 	 	 data 	 bas 	 ing 	 	,	 need 	 s 	 	 report 	 ing 	 	,	remote	volunteer	access	,	all	in	an	easy	-	to	-	use	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
co	:	and	we	 need 	 ed 	 	help	.
alvin	,	our	 soft 	 ware 	 	engineer	and	 co 	 founder 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	built	these	 tool 	 s 	 	.
chris	and	bill	have	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	time	to	use	 operation 	 s 	 	and	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	disaster	 area 	 s 	 	since	 th 	 is 	 	past	january	,	setting	up	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	training	 resident 	 s 	 	and	 licens 	 ing 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	 area 	 s 	 	that	are	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	 disaster 	 s 	 	.
mo	:	one	of	our	first	 launch 	 es 	 	was	after	the	dallas	 tornado 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	past	april	.
we	flew	 in 	 to 	 	a	town	that	had	a	static	 out 	 d 	 ated 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	a	 fre 	 netic 	 	facebook	feed	 try 	 ing 	 	to	structure	the	 respons 	 e 	 	.
and	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	our	platform	.
all	of	the	interest	came	in	the	first	four	 day 	 s 	 	,	but	by	the	time	they	lost	the	news	cycle	,	that	's	when	the	 need 	 s 	 	came	in	,	yet	they	had	 th 	 is 	 	massive	resource	of	what	people	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	give	and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	meet	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 resident 	 s 	 	.
co	:	so	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	could	be	better	.
 emerge 	 ncy 	 	 prepared 	 ness 	 	is	a	big	deal	in	disaster	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	 town 	 s 	 	 safe 	 r 	 	and	more	 resili 	 ent 	 	.
imagine	if	we	could	have	these	 system 	 s 	 	ready	to	go	in	a	place	before	a	disaster	.
so	that	's	what	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	 place 	 s 	 	so	people	expect	it	,	so	people	know	how	to	use	it	and	so	it	can	be	 fill 	 ed 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	time	with	that	 micro 	 information 	 	that	 drive 	 s 	 	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
mo	:	it	's	not	rocket	science	.
these	 tool 	 s 	 	are	obvious	and	people	want	them	.
in	our	 home 	 town 	 	,	we	trained	a	half	-	dozen	 resident 	 s 	 	to	run	these	web	 tool 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
 be 	 cause 	 	caitria	and	i	live	here	in	boston	.
they	took	to	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	and	now	they	are	 force 	 s 	 	of	nature	.
there	are	over	three	volunteer	 group 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 al 	 most 	 	every	day	,	and	have	 be 	 en 	 	since	june	1st	of	last	year	,	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	these	 resident 	 s 	 	get	what	they	need	and	get	back	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	.
they	have	 hot 	 lines 	 	and	 spread 	 sheet 	 s 	 	and	data	.
co	:	and	that	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
june	1st	 th 	 is 	 	year	 mark 	 ed 	 	the	one	-	year	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	the	monson	tornado	.
and	our	community	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	or	more	 empower 	 ed 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	see	the	same	 transform 	 ation 	 	in	texas	and	in	alabama	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	harvard	or	mit	to	fly	in	and	fix	 problem 	 s 	 	after	a	disaster	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	local	.
no	matter	how	good	an	aid	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	at	what	they	do	,	they	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	have	to	go	home	.
but	if	you	give	 local 	 s 	 	the	 tool 	 s 	 	,	if	you	show	them	what	they	can	do	to	 re 	 cover 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	.
mo	:	all	right	.	let	's	go	.
