twelve	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 found 	 ed 	 	zipcar	.
zipcar	 buy 	 s 	 	 car 	 s 	 	and	 park 	 s 	 	them	 through 	 out 	 	dense	 metro 	 politan 	 	 area 	 s 	 	for	people	to	use	,	by	the	hour	and	by	the	day	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 own 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 car 	 s 	 	.
each	zipcar	 replace 	 s 	 	15	personal	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	each	driver	 drive 	 s 	 	about	80	percent	less	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	now	 pay 	 ing 	 	the	full	cost	,	all	at	once	,	in	real	time	.
but	what	zipcar	 re 	 ally 	 	did	was	make	sharing	the	norm	.
now	,	a	decade	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	time	to	push	the	 envelop 	 e 	 	a	little	bit	,	and	so	a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	paris	with	my	husband	and	 young 	 est 	 	child	,	and	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	buzzcar	a	year	ago	.
buzzcar	lets	people	rent	out	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 car 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	a	car	,	we	invest	in	a	community	.
we	 br 	 ing 	 	the	power	of	a	corporation	to	 individual 	 s 	 	who	add	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 s 	 	to	the	network	.
some	people	call	 th 	 is 	 	peer	-	to	-	peer	.
 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	express	the	 human 	 ity 	 	of	what	's	going	on	,	and	the	personal	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	but	that	is	 al 	 so 	 	like	 say 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	yard	sale	or	a	bake	sale	or	 baby 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	peer	-	to	-	peer	.
it	's	like	 say 	 ing 	 	yard	 sale 	 s 	 	are	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	ebay	,	or	craft	 fair 	 s 	 	are	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	etsy	.
but	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	've	got	the	power	of	a	free	and	open	 inter 	 net 	 	,	and	on	top	of	that	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	a	platform	for	 particip 	 ation 	 	,	and	the	 peer 	 s 	 	are	now	in	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	the	company	,	creating	 share 	 d 	 	value	on	 share 	 d 	 	 value 	 s 	 	,	and	each	 strength 	 en 	 ing 	 	the	other	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	what	the	other	ca	n't	do	.

what	 do 	 es 	 	it	do	 re 	 ally 	 	well	?	it	 create 	 s 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	of	scale	,	significant	and	long	-	term	resource	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	the	 expert 	 ise 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	and	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 mind 	 s 	 	,	and	for	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 consumer 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	 standard 	 s 	 	,	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 course 	 	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	 a 	 s 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	bound	up	in	a	brand	promise	,	and	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	a	platform	for	 particip 	 ation 	 	.
 peer 	 s 	 	are	giving	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	expensive	for	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	do	.
what	do	they	 br 	 ing 	 	?	they	 br 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fabulous	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	expensive	for	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	deliver	?
it	 deliver 	 s 	 	 local 	 ization 	 	and	 custom 	 ization 	 	,	 special 	 ization 	 	,	and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	about	social	 network 	 s 	 	and	how	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 year 	 ning 	 	and	eager	to	get	 in 	 side 	 	there	?
it	's	natural	for	me	.	me	and	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	i	can	connect	to	them	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 deliver 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	fabulous	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	and	i	'll	talk	about	that	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	we	have	the	 peer 	 s 	 	that	are	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	the	 service 	 s 	 	and	the	product	,	and	the	company	that	's	 do 	 ing 	 	the	stuff	that	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	do	.
the	two	of	these	are	 deliver 	 ing 	 	the	best	of	both	 world 	 s 	 	.
some	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	:	in	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	carpooling.com	.	ten	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	three	and	a	half	million	people	have	 join 	 ed 	 	up	,	and	a	million	 ride 	 s 	 	are	 share 	 d 	 	every	day	.
it	's	a	 phenomen 	 al 	 	thing	.	it	's	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	2,500	tgv	 train 	 s 	 	,	and	just	think	,	they	did	n't	have	to	lay	a	track	or	buy	a	car	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	excess	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
and	it	's	not	just	with	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	my	love	,	but	of	course	in	other	 realm 	 s 	 	.	here	's	fiverr.com	.
i	met	these	 founder 	 s 	 	just	 week 	 s 	 	after	they	had	 launch 	 ed 	 	,	and	now	,	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	what	would	you	do	for	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	?

and	not	just	easy	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 any 	 one 	 	can	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	 peer 	 s 	 	,	inc.	 con 	 cept 	 	is	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	and	complex	realm	.
topcoder	 ha 	 s 	 	400,000	 engineer 	 s 	 	who	are	 deliver 	 ing 	 	complex	design	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.
when	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	ceo	,	he	had	 th 	 is 	 	great	line	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	have	a	community	that	 own 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	company	.	``
and	then	my	all	-	time	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	etsy	.
etsy	is	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 good 	 s 	 	that	people	make	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	they	're	selling	it	in	a	 market 	 place 	 	.
it	just	 celebr 	 ated 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 seven 	 th 	 	 annivers 	 ary 	 	,	and	after	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	last	year	it	 deliver 	 ed 	 	530	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	 sale 	 s 	 	to	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	making	 t 	 hose 	 	 object 	 s 	 	.
i	know	you	 guy 	 s 	 	out	there	who	are	 business 	 people 	 	,	are	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	my	god	,	i	want	to	build	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
i	see	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	speed	and	scale	.
you	mean	all	i	have	to	do	is	build	a	platform	and	all	these	people	are	going	to	put	 the 	 ir 	 	stuff	on	top	and	i	 s 	 it 	 	back	and	roll	it	in	?	``
building	these	 platform 	 s 	 	for	 particip 	 ation 	 	are	so	 non 	 trivial 	 	to	do	.
i	think	of	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	of	google	video	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	youtube	.
who	would	have	thought	that	two	young	 guy 	 s 	 	and	a	start	-	up	would	beat	out	google	video	?	why	?
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	no	idea	why	.	i	did	n't	talk	to	them	.
but	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	had	the	``	share	``	button	a	little	bit	 bright 	 er 	 	and	to	the	right	,	and	so	it	was	 eas 	 ier 	 	and	more	convenient	for	the	two	 side 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 particip 	 ating 	 	on	these	 network 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	a	lot	about	building	a	peer	platform	now	,	and	a	 peer 	 s 	 	,	inc.	company	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	in	paris	.
so	let	me	take	you	back	how	it	's	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	different	building	buzzcar	than	it	was	building	zipcar	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	every	single	thing	we	do	 ha 	 s 	 	these	two	different	bodies	that	i	have	to	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	:	the	 owner 	 s 	 	who	are	going	to	provide	the	 car 	 s 	 	and	the	 driver 	 s 	 	who	are	going	to	rent	them	.
every	single	decision	,	i	have	to	think	about	what	is	right	for	both	 side 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	i	'll	give	you	one	that	is	not	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	 insur 	 ance 	 	.
it	took	me	a	year	and	a	half	to	get	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	just	right	.
 hour 	 s 	 	and	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	with	 insur 	 ers 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	about	risk	and	how	 th 	 is 	 	is	 total 	 ly 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	they	'd	never	thought	of	it	before	.
way	too	much	money	,	i	just	ca	n't	even	go	there	,	with	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	 th 	 is 	 	is	different	,	who	's	 respons 	 ible 	 	to	whom	,	and	the	result	was	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	provide	 owner 	 s 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 driv 	 ing 	 	 record 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
the	 car 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 insur 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 rent 	 al 	 	,	and	it	 give 	 s 	 	 driver 	 s 	 	what	they	need	,	and	what	do	they	need	?
they	need	a	low	 deduct 	 ible 	 	,	and	24	-	hour	 road 	 side 	 	 assist 	 ance 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	trick	to	get	these	two	 side 	 s 	 	.
so	now	i	want	to	take	you	to	the	moment	of	--	when	you	're	an	entrepreneur	,	and	you	've	 start 	 ed 	 	a	new	company	,	there	's	the	,	here	's	all	the	stuff	we	do	 before 	 hand 	 	,	and	then	the	service	 launch 	 es 	 	.	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
so	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 month 	 s 	 	of	work	,	they	come	 in 	 to 	 	play	.
last	june	1	,	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	.	it	was	an	 excit 	 ing 	 	moment	.
and	all	the	 owner 	 s 	 	are	 add 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
all	the	 driver 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	 member 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 excel 	 lent 	 	.
the	 reservation 	 s 	 	start	coming	in	,	and	here	,	 owner 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	text	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	and	 email 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	joe	 want 	 s 	 	to	rent	your	car	for	the	 week 	 end 	 	.
you	can	earn	60	 eur 	 os 	 	.	is	n't	that	great	?	 y 	 es 	 	or	no	?	``
no	 re 	 ply 	 	.	like	,	a	huge	proportion	of	them	could	n't	be	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	after	they	had	just	 start 	 ed 	 	,	they	just	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	,	to	 re 	 ply 	 	.
so	i	thought	,	``	 d 	 uh 	 	,	 rob 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	industrial	production	and	peer	production	.	``
industrial	production	,	the	whole	point	of	industrial	production	is	to	provide	a	 standard 	 ized 	 	,	exact	service	model	that	is	 consist 	 ent 	 	every	single	time	,	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 thank 	 ful 	 	that	my	 smart 	 phone 	 	is	made	using	industrial	production	.
and	zipcar	 provide 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	,	 consist 	 ent 	 	service	that	 work 	 s 	 	 fabulous 	 ly 	 	.
but	what	 do 	 es 	 	peer	production	do	?	peer	production	is	 th 	 is 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	you	have	a	big	quality	range	,	and	so	ebay	,	 clever 	 ly 	 	,	the	first	peer	production	,	peer	,	inc.	company	,	i	'd	say	,	they	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	early	on	,	we	need	to	have	 rating 	 s 	 	and	 comment 	 aries 	 	and	all	that	 y 	 ucky 	 	side	stuff	.
we	can	flag	that	and	we	can	put	it	to	the	side	,	and	people	who	are	 buy 	 ers 	 	and	 consumer 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	to	deal	with	it	.
so	going	back	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	look	of	 excit 	 ement 	 	and	joy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	that	i	'd	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	for	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	did	happen	,	and	what	's	that	?
that	is	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	what	's	going	on	.
you	have	these	different	fabulous	 owner 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	different	 car 	 s 	 	,	different	 price 	 s 	 	,	different	 location 	 s 	 	.
they	dress	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	look	different	,	and	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	i	love	these	 photo 	 s 	 	every	time	i	look	at	them	.
cool	 guy 	 s 	 	,	 excit 	 ed 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	and	here	is	selma	,	who	--	i	love	 th 	 is 	 	driver	.
and	after	a	year	,	we	have	1,000	 car 	 s 	 	that	are	 park 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	france	and	6,000	people	who	are	 member 	 s 	 	and	eager	to	drive	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	not	be	possible	to	do	that	in	economic	fashion	for	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	company	.
back	to	 th 	 is 	 	spectrum	.
so	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	,	we	had	the	 yu 	 ck 	 	side	,	but	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	real	 w 	 ow 	 	side	.
and	i	can	tell	you	two	great	 st 	 ories 	 	.
a	driver	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	they	went	to	rent	a	car	to	go	up	the	coast	of	france	and	the	owner	 g 	 ave 	 	it	to	them	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	,	here	's	where	the	 cliff 	 s 	 	are	,	and	here	's	all	the	 beach 	 es 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	best	beach	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	best	fish	restaurant	is	.	``
and	the	 peer 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 come 	 	,	 peer 	 s 	 	and	 owner 	 s 	 	create	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	and	so	at	the	last	minute	people	can	--	a	driver	can	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	know	what	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	need	the	car	,	is	it	 avail 	 able 	 	?	``	and	that	person	will	say	,	``	 s 	 ure 	 	,	my	wife	's	at	home	.	go	pick	up	the	 key 	 s 	 	.	go	do	it	.	``
so	you	can	have	these	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	 thing 	 s 	 	that	ca	n't	happen	,	and	it	's	a	kind	of	``	 w 	 ow 	 	!	``	and	i	want	to	say	``	 w 	 ow 	 	!	``
type	of	thing	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	,	if	you	're	a	company	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	might	have	10	people	who	are	in	charge	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	or	100	people	who	are	in	charge	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	peer	,	inc.	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	is	that	you	have	 ten 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	even	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	creating	 experiment 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	model	,	and	so	out	of	all	that	influence	and	that	effort	,	you	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 exception 	 al 	 	amount	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	is	coming	out	.
so	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	,	if	we	come	back	to	why	did	i	call	it	buzzcar	?	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	all	of	us	about	the	power	of	the	hive	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	platform	that	 individual 	 s 	 	want	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	and	 innov 	 ate 	 	on	.
and	for	me	,	when	i	think	about	our	future	,	and	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	seem	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	large	,	the	scale	is	 im 	 possible 	 	,	the	 urge 	 ncy 	 	is	there	,	 peer 	 s 	 	,	inc.	 provide 	 s 	 	the	speed	and	scale	and	the	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	the	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	that	is	going	to	answer	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
all	we	have	to	do	is	create	a	fabulous	platform	for	 particip 	 ation 	 	--	 non 	 trivial 	 	.
so	i	 continu 	 e 	 	to	think	that	 transport 	 ation 	 	is	the	center	of	the	hard	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
all	 problem 	 s 	 	come	back	to	 transport 	 ation 	 	for	me	.
but	there	are	all	these	other	 area 	 s 	 	that	are	these	 pro 	 found 	 	,	big	 problem 	 s 	 	that	i	know	that	we	can	work	on	,	and	people	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	them	in	 man 	 y 	 	different	 sector 	 s 	 	,	but	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	fabulous	group	of	 thing 	 s 	 	with	the	power	of	 th 	 is 	 	 peer 	 s 	 	,	inc.	model	.
so	over	the	last	decade	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 revel 	 ing 	 	in	the	power	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	how	it	's	 empower 	 ed 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	,	and	for	me	,	what	 peer 	 s 	 	,	inc.	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 take 	 s 	 	it	up	a	 not 	 ch 	 	.	we	're	now	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	power	of	the	company	and	the	corporation	and	 super 	 charging 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
so	for	me	,	it	's	a	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
together	,	we	can	.
thank	you	.
