 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	there	are	 giant 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	,	and	we	now	have	video	proof	,	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	that	saw	the	 discover 	 y 	 	channel	 document 	 ary 	 	are	no	doubt	aware	.
i	was	one	of	the	three	 scientist 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	that	took	place	last	summer	off	japan	.
i	'm	the	short	one	.
the	other	two	are	dr.	tsunemi	kubodera	and	dr.	steve	o'shea	.
i	owe	my	 particip 	 ation 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	now	-	historic	event	to	ted	.
in	2010	,	there	was	a	ted	event	 call 	 ed 	 	mission	blue	held	 a 	 board 	 	the	lindblad	 explore 	 r 	 	in	the	galapagos	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	of	sylvia	earle	's	ted	wish	.
i	spoke	about	a	new	way	of	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	ocean	,	one	that	 focus 	 es 	 	on	 attract 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 scar 	 ing 	 	them	away	.
 mi 	 ke 	 	degruy	was	 al 	 so 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	,	and	he	spoke	with	great	 pass 	 ion 	 	about	his	love	of	the	ocean	,	and	he	 al 	 so 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	me	about	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	my	approach	to	 some 	 thing 	 	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	,	which	is	the	hunt	for	the	giant	 s 	 quid 	 	.
it	was	 mi 	 ke 	 	that	got	me	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	the	 s 	 quid 	 	 summ 	 it 	 	,	a	 gather 	 ing 	 	of	 s 	 quid 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	at	the	 discover 	 y 	 	channel	that	summer	 dur 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	week	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	a	talk	on	 un 	 obt 	 rus 	 ive 	 	 view 	 ing 	 	and	optical	luring	of	deep	sea	 s 	 quid 	 	in	which	i	 emphas 	 ized 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	using	quiet	,	 un 	 obt 	 rus 	 ive 	 	 platform 	 s 	 	for	exploration	.
 th 	 is 	 	came	out	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 div 	 es 	 	i	have	made	,	 fart 	 ing 	 	around	in	the	dark	using	these	 platform 	 s 	 	,	and	my	impression	that	i	saw	more	 animal 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	from	the	submersible	than	i	did	with	either	of	the	remote	-	 oper 	 ated 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
but	that	could	just	be	 be 	 cause 	 	the	submersible	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 wide 	 r 	 	field	of	view	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	felt	like	i	saw	more	 animal 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	tiburon	than	the	ventana	,	two	 vehicle 	 s 	 	with	the	same	field	of	view	but	different	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	my	 s 	 us 	 pic 	 ion 	 	was	that	it	might	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	the	amount	of	noise	they	make	.
so	i	set	up	a	 hydro 	 phone 	 	on	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	,	and	i	had	each	of	these	fly	by	at	the	same	speed	and	distance	and	 record 	 ed 	 	the	sound	they	made	.
the	johnson	sea	-	link	--	--	which	you	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	just	 bare 	 ly 	 	hear	here	,	uses	electric	 thrust 	 ers 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	quiet	.
the	tiburon	 al 	 so 	 	uses	electric	powered	 thrust 	 ers 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	quiet	,	but	a	bit	noisier	.
but	most	deep	-	 div 	 ing 	 	rovs	these	 day 	 s 	 	use	hydraulics	and	they	sound	like	the	ventana	.
i	think	that	's	got	to	be	 scar 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 animal 	 s 	 	away	.
so	for	the	deep	sea	 s 	 quid 	 	hunt	,	i	 pro 	 posed 	 	using	an	optical	lure	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	a	camera	platform	with	no	 thrust 	 ers 	 	,	no	 motor 	 s 	 	,	just	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	-	powered	camera	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 illumi 	 nation 	 	coming	from	red	light	that	's	 in 	 visible 	 	to	most	deep	-	sea	 animal 	 s 	 	that	are	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	see	 prim 	 arily 	 	blue	.
that	's	visible	to	our	eye	,	but	it	's	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	 infra 	 red 	 	in	the	deep	sea	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	camera	platform	,	which	we	 call 	 ed 	 	the	medusa	,	could	just	be	 throw 	 n 	 	off	the	back	of	the	ship	,	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	a	float	at	the	surface	with	over	2,000	feet	of	line	,	it	would	just	float	around	 pass 	 ively 	 	carried	by	the	 current 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	light	visible	to	the	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	deep	would	be	the	blue	light	of	the	optical	lure	,	which	we	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	,	or	e-jelly	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	designed	to	 imit 	 ate 	 	the	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	of	the	common	deep	sea	 jelly 	 fish 	 	atolla	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 pin 	 wheel 	 	of	light	that	the	atolla	 produce 	 s 	 	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	burglar	alarm	and	is	a	form	of	defense	.
the	reason	that	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	lure	is	not	 be 	 cause 	 	giant	 s 	 quid 	 	eat	 jelly 	 fish 	 	,	but	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 resort 	 s 	 	to	producing	 th 	 is 	 	light	when	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 chew 	 ed 	 	on	by	a	predator	and	 it 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	hope	for	 es 	 cape 	 	may	be	to	attract	the	attention	of	a	 large 	 r 	 	predator	that	will	attack	 it 	 s 	 	 attack 	 er 	 	and	 there 	 by 	 	afford	it	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	 es 	 cape 	 	.
it	's	a	 s 	 cream 	 	for	help	,	a	last	-	 d 	 itch 	 	attempt	for	 es 	 cape 	 	,	and	a	common	form	of	defense	in	the	deep	sea	.
the	approach	 work 	 ed 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	all	previous	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	garner	a	single	video	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	the	giant	,	we	 manage 	 d 	 	six	,	and	the	first	 trigger 	 ed 	 	wild	 excit 	 ement 	 	.
edith	widder	:	oh	my	god	.	oh	my	god	!	are	you	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	me	?	other	 scientist 	 s 	 	:	oh	ho	ho	!	that	's	just	 hang 	 ing 	 	there	.
ew	:	it	was	like	it	was	 teas 	 ing 	 	us	,	 do 	 ing 	 	a	kind	of	fan	dance	--	now	you	see	me	,	now	you	do	n't	--	and	we	had	four	 s 	 uch 	 	 teas 	 ing 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 s 	 	,	and	then	on	the	fifth	,	it	came	in	and	 total 	 ly 	 	wowed	us	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	 scientist 	 s 	 	:	ooh	.	bang	!	oh	my	god	!	 who 	 a 	 	!
ew	:	the	full	monty	.
what	 re 	 ally 	 	wowed	me	about	that	was	the	way	it	came	in	up	over	the	e-jelly	and	then	 attack 	 ed 	 	the	enormous	thing	next	to	it	,	which	i	think	it	 mis 	 took 	 	for	the	predator	on	the	e	-	jelly	.
but	even	more	 in 	 credible 	 	was	the	 foot 	 age 	 	shot	from	the	triton	submersible	.
what	was	not	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	in	the	 discover 	 y 	 	 document 	 ary 	 	was	that	the	bait	 s 	 quid 	 	that	dr.	kubodera	used	,	a	one	-	meter	long	diamondback	 s 	 quid 	 	had	a	light	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	it	,	a	 s 	 quid 	 	jig	of	the	type	that	longline	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	use	,	and	i	think	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	light	that	 br 	 ought 	 	the	giant	in	.
now	,	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	the	 intens 	 ified 	 	camera	's	view	under	red	light	,	and	that	's	all	dr.	kubodera	could	see	when	the	giant	 come 	 s 	 	in	here	.
and	then	he	got	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	his	 flash 	 light 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	better	,	and	the	giant	did	n't	run	away	,	so	he	 risk 	 ed 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	on	the	white	 light 	 s 	 	on	the	submersible	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	a	creature	of	legend	from	the	 mis 	 ty 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	 in 	 to 	 	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	video	.
it	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 breath 	 taking 	 	,	and	had	 th 	 is 	 	animal	had	 it 	 s 	 	 feed 	 ing 	 	 tent 	 acle 	 s 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	and	fully	 extend 	 ed 	 	,	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 a 	 s 	 	tall	 a 	 s 	 	a	two	-	story	house	.
how	could	 some 	 thing 	 	that	big	live	in	our	ocean	and	yet	remain	unfilmed	 un 	 til 	 	now	?
we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 explore 	 d 	 	about	five	percent	of	our	ocean	.
there	are	great	 discover 	 ies 	 	yet	to	be	made	down	there	,	fantastic	 creature 	 s 	 	 represent 	 ing 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	evolution	and	possibly	bioactive	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	that	could	benefit	us	in	ways	that	we	ca	n't	even	yet	imagine	.
yet	we	have	 s 	 pent 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	fraction	of	the	money	on	ocean	exploration	that	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	on	space	exploration	.
we	need	a	nasa	-	like	 organ 	 ization 	 	for	ocean	exploration	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	need	to	be	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	and	 protect 	 ing 	 	our	life	support	 system 	 s 	 	here	on	earth	.
we	need	--	thank	you	.
exploration	is	the	engine	that	 drive 	 s 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.

so	let	's	all	go	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	,	but	let	's	do	it	in	a	way	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 s 	 care 	 	the	 animal 	 s 	 	away	,	or	,	 a 	 s 	 	 mi 	 ke 	 	degruy	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	want	to	get	away	from	it	all	and	see	 some 	 thing 	 	you	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	,	or	have	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	chance	of	 see 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	no	one	's	ever	 s 	 een 	 	,	get	in	a	sub	.	``
