so	would	n't	it	be	 amaz 	 ing 	 	if	our	 phone 	 s 	 	could	see	the	world	in	the	same	way	that	we	do	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	point	a	phone	at	 any 	 thing 	 	,	and	then	have	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 image 	 s 	 	and	 object 	 s 	 	like	the	human	brain	,	and	then	be	able	to	pull	in	information	from	an	 al 	 most 	 	infinite	library	of	knowledge	and	 experience 	 s 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	.
well	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	that	was	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	science	fiction	,	but	now	we	've	 move 	 d 	 	to	a	world	where	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	possible	.
so	the	best	way	of	 explain 	 ing 	 	it	is	to	just	show	it	.
what	you	can	see	over	here	is	tamara	,	who	is	 hold 	 ing 	 	my	phone	that	's	now	 plug 	 ged 	 	in	.
so	let	me	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	we	have	here	is	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	of	the	great	poet	rabbie	 burn 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	just	a	normal	image	,	but	if	we	now	 s 	 witch 	 	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	over	to	the	phone	,	running	our	technology	,	you	can	see	 effective 	 ly 	 	what	tamara	's	 see 	 ing 	 	on	the	screen	,	and	when	she	 point 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 magic 	 al 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
voice	:	now	 s 	 im 	 mer 	 	 blink 	 s 	 	on	 flower 	 y 	 	 bra 	 es 	 	...
matt	 mill 	 s 	 	:	now	,	what	's	great	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	there	's	no	 trick 	 ery 	 	here	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	image	.
and	what	's	great	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	technology	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	phone	to	start	to	see	and	understand	much	like	how	the	human	brain	 do 	 es 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	i	move	the	object	around	,	it	's	going	to	track	it	and	 over 	 lay 	 	that	content	 seam 	 lessly 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	thing	that	's	 in 	 credible 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	 advance 	 d 	 	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	.
all	the	 process 	 ing 	 	to	do	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	on	the	 de 	 vice 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 application 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	in	 thing 	 s 	 	like	art	in	 museum 	 s 	 	,	like	you	just	saw	,	or	in	the	world	of	,	say	,	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	or	print	 journal 	 ism 	 	.
so	a	 news 	 paper 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	date	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 print 	 ed 	 	.
and	here	is	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	's	 news 	 paper 	 	,	and	we	have	some	wimbledon	news	,	which	is	great	.
now	what	we	can	do	is	point	at	the	front	of	the	 news 	 paper 	 	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	get	the	 bullet 	 in 	 	.
voice	:	...	to	the	grass	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	you	adapt	and	you	,	you	have	to	be	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	you	have	to	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	change	direction	at	a	split	second	,	and	she	 do 	 es 	 	all	that	.	she	's	won	 th 	 is 	 	title	.
mm	:	and	that	 link 	 ing 	 	of	the	digital	content	to	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	physical	is	what	we	call	an	aura	,	and	i	'll	be	using	that	term	a	little	bit	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	through	the	talk	.
so	,	what	's	great	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	is	n't	just	a	 fast 	 er 	 	,	more	convenient	way	to	get	information	in	the	real	world	,	but	there	are	 time 	 s 	 	when	 actual 	 ly 	 	using	 th 	 is 	 	medium	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	be	able	to	 dis 	 play 	 	information	in	a	way	that	was	never	before	possible	.
so	what	i	have	here	is	a	 wire 	 less 	 	 route 	 r 	 	.
my	american	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	have	told	me	i	've	got	to	call	it	a	 route 	 r 	 	,	so	that	 every 	 one 	 	here	 understand 	 s 	 	--	--	but	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	here	is	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
so	now	what	i	can	do	is	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 instruct 	 ions 	 	for	the	 de 	 vice 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	i	can	 simpl 	 y 	 	point	at	it	,	the	 de 	 vice 	 	is	 recogn 	 ized 	 	,	and	then	--	voice	:	begin	by	 plug 	 ging 	 	in	the	 gr 	 ey 	 	adsl	cable	.
then	connect	the	power	.	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	yellow	 ether 	 net 	 	cable	.
 congratula 	 tions 	 	.	you	have	now	 complete 	 d 	 	 set 	 up 	 	.
mm	:	awesome	.	thank	you	.
the	 in 	 credible 	 	work	that	made	that	possible	was	 d 	 one 	 	here	in	the	u.k.	by	 scientist 	 s 	 	at	cambridge	,	and	they	work	in	our	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	got	a	 love 	 ly 	 	picture	of	them	here	.
they	could	n't	all	be	on	stage	,	but	we	're	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	aura	to	the	stage	,	so	here	they	are	.
they	're	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 animate 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	fourth	take	,	i	'm	told	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	cambridge	,	let	's	now	move	on	to	technical	 advance 	 ments 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	since	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	on	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	less	than	12	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	speed	and	the	 process 	 ing 	 	in	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	at	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 phenomen 	 al 	 	rate	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	can	now	take	cinema	-	quality	3d	 model 	 s 	 	and	place	them	in	the	world	around	me	,	so	i	have	one	over	here	.
tamara	,	would	you	like	to	jump	in	?
mm	:	i	should	leap	in	.
so	then	,	after	the	 f 	 un 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	the	more	 emotion 	 al 	 	side	of	what	we	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	technology	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	see	the	world	through	 some 	 one 	 	's	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	for	that	person	to	be	able	to	take	a	moment	in	time	and	 effective 	 ly 	 	store	it	and	tag	it	to	 some 	 thing 	 	physical	that	 exist 	 s 	 	in	the	real	world	.
what	's	great	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	the	 tool 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	are	free	.
they	're	open	,	they	're	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	 with 	 in 	 	our	application	,	and	 educ 	 ators 	 	have	 re 	 ally 	 	got	on	board	with	the	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
so	we	have	 teacher 	 s 	 	who	've	 tag 	 ged 	 	up	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	,	 teacher 	 s 	 	who	've	 tag 	 ged 	 	up	school	 class 	 rooms 	 	,	and	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	school	in	the	u.k	.
i	have	a	picture	here	from	a	video	,	and	we	're	now	going	to	play	it	.
teacher	:	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.	keep	going	.
child	:	tv	.
child	:	oh	my	god	.
teacher	:	now	move	it	either	side	.	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
move	away	from	it	and	come	back	to	it	.
child	:	oh	,	that	is	so	cool	.
teacher	:	and	then	,	have	you	got	it	 aga 	 in 	 	?
child	:	oh	my	god	!	how	did	you	do	that	?
second	child	:	it	's	magic	.
mm	:	so	,	it	's	not	magic	.
it	's	 avail 	 able 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	to	do	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	you	how	easy	it	is	to	do	by	 do 	 ing 	 	one	right	now	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	--	i	'm	told	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 stad 	 ium 	 	wave	,	so	we	're	going	to	start	from	 th 	 is 	 	side	of	the	room	on	the	count	of	three	,	and	go	over	to	here	.
tamara	,	are	you	 record 	 ing 	 	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	are	you	all	ready	?
one	,	two	,	three	.	go	!
audience	:	whooooooo	!
mm	:	 fellow 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	that	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	now	we	're	going	to	 s 	 witch 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	aurasma	application	,	and	what	tamara	's	going	to	do	is	tag	that	video	that	we	just	took	onto	my	badge	,	so	that	i	can	remember	it	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
now	,	we	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	and	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	about	the	 education 	 al 	 	side	.
on	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	side	,	we	have	people	who	've	 d 	 one 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 s 	 end 	 	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	and	christmas	 card 	 s 	 	back	to	 the 	 ir 	 	family	with	little	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	on	them	.
we	have	people	who	have	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	taken	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	engine	 ba 	 y 	 	of	an	old	car	and	 tag 	 ged 	 	up	different	 component 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	an	engine	,	so	that	if	you	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	and	you	want	to	find	out	more	,	you	can	point	and	discover	the	information	.
we	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	that	we	live	and	work	,	and	the	way	that	we	see	the	world	,	and	what	's	great	is	,	we	sort	of	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	next	paradigm	shift	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	we	can	 liter 	 ally 	 	take	the	content	that	we	share	,	we	discover	,	and	that	we	enjoy	and	make	it	a	part	of	the	world	around	us	.
it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	free	to	download	 th 	 is 	 	application	.
if	you	have	a	good	wi	-	fi	 connect 	 ion 	 	or	3g	,	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	.
oh	,	there	we	are	.	we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	it	now	.
it	's	just	going	to	do	a	 tin 	 y 	 	bit	of	 process 	 ing 	 	to	convert	that	image	that	we	just	took	 in 	 to 	 	a	sort	of	digital	 finger 	 print 	 	,	and	the	great	thing	is	,	if	you	're	a	professional	user	,	--	so	,	a	 news 	 paper 	 	--	the	 tool 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 ident 	 ical 	 	to	what	we	've	just	used	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	that	you	've	got	the	ability	to	add	in	 link 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	content	.	are	you	now	ready	?
tamara	roukaerts	:	we	're	ready	to	go	.
mm	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	,	i	'm	told	we	're	ready	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	we	can	now	point	at	the	image	,	and	there	you	all	are	.
