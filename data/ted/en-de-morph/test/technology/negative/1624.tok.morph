b.j	.	was	one	of	 man 	 y 	 	fellow	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	who	had	big	 plan 	 s 	 	for	the	future	.
he	had	a	vision	.	when	he	got	out	,	he	was	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 do 	 pe 	 	game	for	good	and	fly	straight	,	and	he	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 mer 	 ging 	 	his	two	 pass 	 ions 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	vision	.
he	'd	 s 	 pent 	 	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	buy	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	 feature 	 d 	 	women	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	on	top	of	or	 in 	 side 	 	of	 luxur 	 y 	 	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
it	was	my	first	week	in	federal	 pri 	 son 	 	,	and	i	was	 learn 	 ing 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	that	it	was	n't	what	you	see	on	tv	.
in	fact	,	it	was	 tee 	 ming 	 	with	smart	,	 ambit 	 ious 	 	men	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	business	 instinct 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	sharp	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	of	the	ceos	who	had	 win 	 ed 	 	and	 din 	 ed 	 	me	six	 month 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	when	i	was	a	 ris 	 ing 	 	star	in	the	missouri	senate	.
now	,	95	percent	of	the	 guy 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	with	had	 be 	 en 	 	drug	 deal 	 ers 	 	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	but	when	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	what	they	did	,	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	in	a	different	 jar 	 gon 	 	,	but	the	business	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	that	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 un 	 like 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	that	you	'd	learn	in	a	first	year	mba	class	at	wharton	:	 pro 	 motion 	 al 	 	 incentive 	 s 	 	,	you	never	charge	a	first	-	time	user	,	focus	-	 group 	 ing 	 	new	product	 launch 	 es 	 	,	 territ 	 orial 	 	expansion	.
but	they	did	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 re 	 living 	 	the	 glor 	 y 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.
for	the	most	part	,	 every 	 one 	 	was	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
it	's	a	lot	 hard 	 er 	 	than	you	might	think	.
 contr 	 ary 	 	to	what	most	people	think	,	people	do	n't	pay	,	 taxpayer 	 s 	 	do	n't	pay	,	for	your	life	when	you	're	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.	you	've	got	to	pay	for	your	own	life	.
you	've	got	to	pay	for	your	soap	,	your	 deodo 	 rant 	 	,	 tooth 	 brush 	 	,	 tooth 	 paste 	 	,	all	of	it	.
and	it	's	hard	for	a	couple	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
first	,	 every 	 thing 	 	's	 mark 	 ed 	 	up	30	to	50	percent	from	what	you	'd	pay	on	the	street	,	and	second	,	you	do	n't	make	a	lot	of	money	.
i	 un 	 load 	 ed 	 	 truck 	 s 	 	.	that	was	my	full	-	time	job	,	 un 	 load 	 ing 	 	 truck 	 s 	 	at	a	food	 ware 	 house 	 	,	for	$	5.25	,	not	an	hour	,	but	per	month	.
so	how	do	you	 surviv 	 e 	 	?
well	,	you	learn	to	hustle	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 hustle 	 s 	 	.
there	's	legal	 hustle 	 s 	 	.
you	pay	 every 	 thing 	 	in	 stamp 	 s 	 	.	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 curr 	 ency 	 	.
you	charge	 an 	 other 	 	 in 	 mate 	 	to	clean	his	cell	.
there	's	sort	of	 il 	 legal 	 	 hustle 	 s 	 	,	like	you	run	a	 barb 	 er 	 shop 	 	out	of	your	cell	.
there	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	 hustle 	 s 	 	:	you	run	a	tattoo	 par 	 lor 	 	out	of	your	own	cell	.
and	there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	 hustle 	 s 	 	,	which	you	smuggle	in	,	you	get	 smuggle 	 d 	 	in	,	 drug 	 s 	 	,	 porn 	 ography 	 	,	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	,	and	just	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	 out 	 er 	 	world	,	there	's	a	risk	-	reward	 trade 	 off 	 	,	so	the	 risk 	 ier 	 	the	enterprise	,	the	more	 profit 	 able 	 	it	can	 potential 	 ly 	 	be	.
you	want	a	 cigar 	 ette 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	?	three	to	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
you	want	an	old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	cell	phone	that	you	flip	open	and	is	about	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	your	head	?	three	hundred	 buck 	 s 	 	.
you	want	a	 dirt 	 y 	 	magazine	?
well	,	it	can	be	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	tell	,	one	of	the	 defi 	 ning 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 pri 	 son 	 	life	is	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	it	was	 concoct 	 ing 	 	 delic 	 ious 	 	 meal 	 s 	 	from	 stole 	 n 	 	 scrap 	 s 	 	from	the	 ware 	 house 	 	,	 sculpt 	 ing 	 	people	's	hair	with	toenail	 clip 	 per 	 s 	 	,	or	 construct 	 ing 	 	 weight 	 s 	 	from	 boulder 	 s 	 	in	 laundr 	 y 	 	 bag 	 s 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	on	to	tree	 limb 	 s 	 	,	 prisoner 	 s 	 	learn	how	to	make	do	with	less	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	want	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	that	they	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	and	start	 restaurant 	 s 	 	,	 barb 	 er 	 	 shop 	 s 	 	,	personal	training	 business 	 es 	 	.
but	there	's	no	training	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	them	for	that	,	no	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	at	all	in	 pri 	 son 	 	,	no	one	to	help	them	write	a	business	plan	,	figure	out	a	way	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	the	business	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	they	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	grasp	 in 	 to 	 	legal	 enterprise 	 s 	 	,	no	access	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	even	.
and	then	,	when	they	come	out	,	most	 state 	 s 	 	do	n't	even	have	a	law	 prohibit 	 ing 	 	 employ 	 ers 	 	from	 discrimi 	 nating 	 	against	people	with	a	 back 	 ground 	 	.
so	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	should	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	that	two	out	of	three	ex	-	 offend 	 ers 	 	re	-	offend	 with 	 in 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
look	,	i	 li 	 ed 	 	to	the	 fed 	 s 	 	.	i	lost	a	year	of	my	life	from	it	.
but	when	i	came	out	,	i	 vow 	 ed 	 	that	i	was	going	to	do	 what 	 ever 	 	i	could	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 guy 	 s 	 	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	i	was	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	with	did	n't	have	to	waste	any	more	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	than	they	 al 	 ready 	 	had	.
so	i	hope	that	you	'll	think	about	 help 	 ing 	 	in	some	way	.
the	best	thing	we	can	do	is	figure	out	ways	to	nurture	the	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	spirit	and	the	tremendous	 un 	 ta 	 pped 	 	potential	in	our	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	do	n't	,	they	're	not	going	to	learn	any	new	 skill 	 s 	 	that	's	going	to	help	them	,	and	they	'll	be	right	back	.
all	they	'll	learn	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	is	new	 hustle 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
