i	want	to	talk	about	social	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	social	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	.
i	happen	to	have	triplets	.
they	're	little	.	they	're	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	tell	people	i	have	triplets	.
they	say	,	``	 re 	 ally 	 	?	how	 man 	 y 	 	?	``
here	's	a	picture	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 s 	 age 	 	and	annalisa	and	rider	.
now	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	happen	to	be	 ga 	 y 	 	.
 be 	 ing 	 	 ga 	 y 	 	and	 father 	 ing 	 	triplets	is	by	far	the	most	 social 	 ly 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	 social 	 ly 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	thing	i	have	ever	 d 	 one 	 	.
the	real	social	 innov 	 ation 	 	i	want	to	talk	about	 involve 	 s 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	.
i	want	to	talk	about	how	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	taught	to	think	about	giving	and	about	 char 	 ity 	 	and	about	the	 non 	 profit 	 	sector	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 under 	 min 	 ing 	 	the	 cause 	 s 	 	we	love	and	our	 pro 	 found 	 	 year 	 ning 	 	to	change	the	world	.
but	before	i	do	that	,	i	want	to	ask	if	we	even	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 non 	 profit 	 	sector	 ha 	 s 	 	any	serious	role	to	play	in	changing	the	world	.
a	lot	of	people	say	now	that	business	will	lift	up	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	and	social	business	will	take	care	of	the	rest	.
and	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	business	will	move	the	great	mass	of	 human 	 ity 	 	forward	.
but	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	that	10	percent	or	more	that	is	most	 dis 	 advantage 	 d 	 	or	 un 	 luck 	 y 	 	.
and	social	business	 need 	 s 	 	 market 	 s 	 	,	and	there	are	some	 issue 	 s 	 	for	which	you	just	ca	n't	develop	the	kind	of	money	 measure 	 s 	 	that	you	need	for	a	market	.
i	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	board	of	a	center	for	the	 develop 	 ment 	 ally 	 	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	,	and	these	people	want	laughter	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	they	want	love	.
how	do	you	 mon 	 et 	 ize 	 	that	?
and	that	's	where	the	 non 	 profit 	 	sector	and	 philanthro 	 py 	 	come	in	.
 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	the	market	for	love	.
it	is	the	market	for	all	 t 	 hose 	 	people	for	whom	there	is	no	other	market	coming	.
and	so	if	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	,	like	buckminster	 full 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	a	world	that	 work 	 s 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	,	with	no	one	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	left	out	,	then	the	 non 	 profit 	 	sector	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	serious	part	of	the	conversation	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	.
why	have	our	breast	cancer	 char 	 ities 	 	not	come	close	to	 find 	 ing 	 	a	cure	for	breast	cancer	,	or	our	 home 	 less 	 	 char 	 ities 	 	not	come	close	to	 end 	 ing 	 	 home 	 lessness 	 	in	any	major	city	?
why	 ha 	 s 	 	poverty	 remain 	 ed 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	at	12	percent	of	the	u.s.	population	for	40	 year 	 s 	 	?
and	the	answer	is	,	these	social	 problem 	 s 	 	are	massive	in	scale	,	our	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	are	 tin 	 y 	 	up	against	them	,	and	we	have	a	belief	system	that	 keep 	 s 	 	them	 tin 	 y 	 	.
we	have	two	rulebooks	.
we	have	one	for	the	 non 	 profit 	 	sector	and	one	for	the	rest	of	the	economic	world	.
it	's	an	apartheid	,	and	it	discriminates	against	the	[	 non 	 profit 	 	]	sector	in	five	different	 area 	 s 	 	,	the	first	 be 	 ing 	 	 compens 	 ation 	 	.
so	in	the	for	-	profit	sector	,	the	more	value	you	produce	,	the	more	money	you	can	make	.
but	we	do	n't	like	 non 	 profit 	 s 	 	to	use	money	to	incentivize	people	to	produce	more	in	social	service	.
we	have	a	visceral	 re 	 action 	 	to	the	idea	that	 any 	 one 	 	would	make	 ver 	 y 	 	much	money	 help 	 ing 	 	other	people	.
 interest 	 ing 	 	that	we	do	n't	have	a	visceral	 re 	 action 	 	to	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	people	would	make	a	lot	of	money	not	 help 	 ing 	 	other	people	.
you	know	,	you	want	to	make	50	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	selling	violent	video	 game 	 s 	 	to	 kid 	 s 	 	,	go	for	it	.
we	'll	put	you	on	the	cover	of	wired	magazine	.
but	you	want	to	make	half	a	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	cure	 kid 	 s 	 	of	malaria	,	and	you	're	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	 parasit 	 e 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	we	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	system	of	 ethic 	 s 	 	,	but	what	we	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	system	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	side	effect	,	which	is	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 star 	 k 	 	,	 mutual 	 ly 	 	exclusive	choice	between	 do 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	for	 your 	 self 	 	and	your	family	or	 do 	 ing 	 	good	for	the	world	to	the	 bright 	 est 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	coming	out	of	our	best	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	and	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	who	could	make	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	 non 	 profit 	 	sector	 march 	 ing 	 	every	year	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	for	-	profit	sector	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	not	 will 	 ing 	 	to	make	that	kind	of	 life 	 long 	 	economic	sacrifice	.
businessweek	did	a	survey	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 compens 	 ation 	 	 package 	 s 	 	for	mbas	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	business	school	,	and	the	 med 	 ian 	 	 compens 	 ation 	 	for	a	stanford	mba	,	with	 bon 	 us 	 	,	at	the	age	of	38	,	was	400,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	for	the	same	year	,	the	average	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	for	the	ceo	of	a	$	5	million	-	plus	medical	 char 	 ity 	 	in	the	u.s	.
was	232,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	for	a	 hung 	 er 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	,	84,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
now	,	there	's	no	way	you	're	going	to	get	a	lot	of	people	with	$	400,000	talent	to	make	a	$	316,000	sacrifice	every	year	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	ceo	of	a	 hung 	 er 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	.
some	people	say	,	``	well	,	that	's	just	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	mba	 type 	 s 	 	are	 greed 	 y 	 	.	``
not	 necess 	 arily 	 	.	they	might	be	smart	.
it	's	 cheap 	 er 	 	for	that	person	to	 don 	 ate 	 	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	every	year	to	the	 hung 	 er 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	,	 s 	 ave 	 	50,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 tax 	 es 	 	,	so	still	be	 rough 	 ly 	 	270,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	game	,	now	be	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 philanthro 	 pist 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 don 	 ated 	 	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	 char 	 ity 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	board	of	the	 hung 	 er 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	supervise	the	poor	sob	who	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	ceo	of	the	 hung 	 er 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	,	and	have	a	 life 	 time 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	power	and	influence	and	popular	praise	still	 a 	 head 	 	of	them	.
the	second	area	of	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	is	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	and	 market 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	tell	the	for	-	profit	sector	,	``	 s 	 pend 	 	,	 s 	 pend 	 	,	 s 	 pend 	 	on	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	last	dollar	no	 long 	 er 	 	 produce 	 s 	 	a	 pen 	 ny 	 	of	value	.	``
but	we	do	n't	like	to	see	our	 don 	 ations 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	on	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	in	 char 	 ity 	 	.
our	attitude	is	,	``	well	,	look	,	if	you	can	get	the	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	 don 	 ated 	 	,	you	know	,	at	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	'm	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	with	that	.
but	i	do	n't	want	my	 don 	 ations 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	on	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
i	want	it	go	to	the	 need 	 y 	 	.	``
 a 	 s 	 	if	the	money	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	could	not	 br 	 ing 	 	in	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 great 	 er 	 	 sum 	 s 	 	of	money	to	serve	the	 need 	 y 	 	.
in	the	1990s	,	my	company	 create 	 d 	 	the	long	distance	aidsride	 bi 	 cycle 	 	 journey 	 s 	 	and	the	60	-	mile	-	long	breast	cancer	three	-	day	 walk 	 s 	 	,	and	over	the	course	of	nine	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	had	182,000	 ordin 	 ary 	 	heroes	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	and	they	raised	a	total	of	581	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
they	raised	more	money	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	for	these	 cause 	 s 	 	than	any	 event 	 s 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	all	based	on	the	idea	that	people	are	 wear 	 y 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	the	 l 	 east 	 	they	can	possibly	do	.
people	are	 year 	 ning 	 	to	measure	the	full	distance	of	 the 	 ir 	 	potential	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	the	 cause 	 s 	 	that	they	care	about	 deep 	 ly 	 	.
but	they	have	to	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
we	got	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	by	 buy 	 ing 	 	full	-	page	 ad 	 s 	 	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	in	the	boston	 glob 	 e 	 	,	in	 prime 	 time 	 	radio	and	tv	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
do	you	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	we	would	have	gotten	if	we	put	up	 fly 	 ers 	 	in	the	 laundr 	 o 	 mat 	 	?
 char 	 it 	 able 	 	giving	 ha 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	in	the	u.s.	,	at	two	percent	of	gdp	ever	since	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 measur 	 ing 	 	it	in	the	1970s	.
that	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	fact	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	in	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	 non 	 profit 	 	sector	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 wrestl 	 e 	 	any	market	share	away	from	the	for	-	profit	sector	.
and	if	you	think	about	it	,	how	could	one	sector	possibly	take	market	share	away	from	 an 	 other 	 	sector	if	it	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	market	?
and	if	we	tell	the	consumer	 brand 	 s 	 	,	``	you	may	advertise	all	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	your	product	,	``	but	we	tell	 char 	 ities 	 	,	``	you	can	not	advertise	all	the	good	that	you	do	,	``	where	do	we	think	the	consumer	 dollar 	 s 	 	are	going	to	flow	?
the	third	area	of	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	is	the	taking	of	risk	in	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	new	 idea 	 s 	 	for	generating	revenue	.
so	disney	can	make	a	new	$	200	million	movie	that	flops	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	 call 	 s 	 	the	attorney	general	.
but	you	do	a	little	$	1	million	community	 fund 	 raise 	 r 	 	for	the	poor	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	produce	a	75	percent	profit	to	the	cause	in	the	first	12	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	your	character	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	question	.
so	 non 	 profit 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	attempt	any	brave	,	 da 	 ring 	 	,	giant	-	scale	new	 fund 	 raising 	 	 endeavor 	 s 	 	for	fear	that	if	the	thing	 fail 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 reputation 	 s 	 	will	be	 drag 	 ged 	 	through	the	mud	.
well	,	you	and	i	know	when	you	prohibit	failure	,	you	kill	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
if	you	kill	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	 fund 	 raising 	 	,	you	ca	n't	raise	more	revenue	.
if	you	ca	n't	raise	more	revenue	,	you	ca	n't	grow	.
and	if	you	ca	n't	grow	,	you	ca	n't	possibly	solve	large	social	 problem 	 s 	 	.
the	fourth	area	is	time	.
so	amazon	went	for	six	 year 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 return 	 ing 	 	any	profit	to	 invest 	 ors 	 	,	and	people	had	patience	.
they	 k 	 new 	 	that	there	was	a	long	-	term	 object 	 ive 	 	down	the	line	of	building	market	 domin 	 ance 	 	.
but	if	a	 non 	 profit 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	ever	had	a	dream	of	building	 magnific 	 ent 	 	scale	that	 requir 	 ed 	 	that	for	six	 year 	 s 	 	,	no	money	was	going	to	go	to	the	 need 	 y 	 	,	it	was	all	going	to	be	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	building	 th 	 is 	 	scale	,	we	would	expect	a	 crucifix 	 ion 	 	.
and	the	last	area	is	profit	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	the	for	-	profit	sector	can	pay	people	 profit 	 s 	 	in	order	to	attract	 the 	 ir 	 	capital	for	 the 	 ir 	 	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	you	ca	n't	pay	 profit 	 s 	 	in	a	 non 	 profit 	 	sector	,	so	the	for	-	profit	sector	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lock	on	the	multi	-	trillion	-	dollar	capital	 market 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 non 	 profit 	 	sector	is	 starv 	 ed 	 	for	growth	and	risk	and	idea	capital	.
well	,	you	put	 t 	 hose 	 	five	 thing 	 s 	 	together	--	you	ca	n't	use	money	to	lure	talent	away	from	the	for	-	profit	sector	,	you	ca	n't	advertise	on	 any 	 where 	 	near	the	scale	the	for	-	profit	sector	 do 	 es 	 	for	new	 custom 	 ers 	 	,	you	ca	n't	take	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 risk 	 s 	 	in	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	that	the	for	-	profit	sector	 take 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	have	the	same	amount	of	time	to	find	them	 a 	 s 	 	the	for	-	profit	sector	,	and	you	do	n't	have	a	stock	market	with	which	to	fund	any	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	even	if	you	could	do	it	in	the	first	place	,	and	you	've	just	put	the	 non 	 profit 	 	sector	at	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	 dis 	 advantage 	 	to	the	for	-	profit	sector	on	every	level	.
if	we	have	any	 doubt 	 s 	 	about	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	rule	book	,	 th 	 is 	 	statistic	is	 sober 	 ing 	 	:	from	1970	to	2009	,	the	number	of	 non 	 profit 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	grew	,	that	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	$	50	million	annual	revenue	 bar 	 rier 	 	,	is	144	.
in	the	same	time	,	the	number	of	for	-	 profit 	 s 	 	that	 cross 	 ed 	 	it	is	46,136	.
so	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	social	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	massive	in	scale	,	and	our	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	ca	n't	generate	any	scale	.
all	of	the	scale	 go 	 es 	 	to	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	and	burger	king	.
so	why	do	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	way	?
well	,	like	most	 fanatic 	 al 	 	dogma	in	america	,	these	 idea 	 s 	 	come	from	old	puritan	 belief 	 s 	 	.
the	puritans	came	here	for	religious	 reason 	 s 	 	,	or	so	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	but	they	 al 	 so 	 	came	here	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	lot	of	money	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 p 	 ious 	 	people	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	 capital 	 ists 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 accus 	 ed 	 	of	 extrem 	 e 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	profit	-	making	 tend 	 encies 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	other	colonists	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	the	puritans	 we 	 re 	 	calvinists	,	so	they	 we 	 re 	 	taught	 liter 	 ally 	 	to	hate	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	taught	that	self	-	interest	was	a	 rag 	 ing 	 	sea	that	was	a	 s 	 ure 	 	path	to	 e 	 ternal 	 	damnation	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	real	problem	for	these	people	,	right	?
here	they	've	come	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	atlantic	to	make	all	 th 	 is 	 	money	.
making	all	 th 	 is 	 	money	will	get	you	 s 	 ent 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	hell	.
what	 we 	 re 	 	they	to	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	 char 	 ity 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	answer	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	 th 	 is 	 	economic	 sanct 	 uary 	 	where	they	could	do	 pen 	 ance 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	profit	-	making	 tend 	 encies 	 	at	five	 cent 	 s 	 	on	the	dollar	.
so	of	course	,	how	could	you	make	money	in	 char 	 ity 	 	if	 char 	 ity 	 	was	your	 pen 	 ance 	 	for	making	money	?
financial	incentive	was	 ex 	 il 	 ed 	 	from	the	realm	of	 help 	 ing 	 	 other 	 s 	 	so	that	it	could	 thriv 	 e 	 	in	the	area	of	making	money	for	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	in	400	 year 	 s 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 inter 	 vene 	 d 	 	to	say	,	``	that	's	 counter 	 productive 	 	and	that	's	 un 	 fair 	 	.	``
now	 th 	 is 	 	 ideo 	 logy 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 police 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	one	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	question	,	which	is	,	``	what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	my	 don 	 ation 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	cause	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 over 	 head 	 	?	``
there	are	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
i	'm	going	to	just	focus	on	two	.
first	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	us	think	that	 over 	 head 	 	is	a	negative	,	that	it	is	 some 	 how 	 	not	part	of	the	cause	.
but	it	 absolute 	 ly 	 	is	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	used	for	growth	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	 over 	 head 	 	is	 some 	 how 	 	an	 ene 	 my 	 	of	the	cause	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	second	,	much	 large 	 r 	 	problem	,	which	is	,	it	 force 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	to	go	 with 	 out 	 	the	 over 	 head 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	grow	in	the	interest	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	 over 	 head 	 	low	.
so	we	've	all	 be 	 en 	 	taught	that	 char 	 ities 	 	should	 s 	 pend 	 	 a 	 s 	 	little	 a 	 s 	 	possible	on	 over 	 head 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 fund 	 raising 	 	under	the	 theor 	 y 	 	that	,	well	,	the	less	money	you	 s 	 pend 	 	on	 fund 	 raising 	 	,	the	more	money	there	is	 avail 	 able 	 	for	the	cause	.
well	,	that	's	true	if	it	's	a	 depress 	 ing 	 	world	in	which	 th 	 is 	 	pie	can	not	be	made	any	 big 	 ger 	 	.
but	if	it	's	a	logical	world	in	which	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	 fund 	 raising 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 raise 	 s 	 	more	 fund 	 s 	 	and	 make 	 s 	 	the	pie	 big 	 ger 	 	,	then	we	have	it	 precise 	 ly 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	and	we	should	be	 invest 	 ing 	 	more	money	,	not	less	,	in	 fund 	 raising 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 fund 	 raising 	 	is	the	one	thing	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	potential	to	 multi 	 ply 	 	the	amount	of	money	 avail 	 able 	 	for	the	cause	that	we	care	about	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	aidsrides	with	an	 initi 	 al 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	of	50,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	risk	capital	.
 with 	 in 	 	nine	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	had	 multi 	 plied 	 	that	1,982	 time 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	108	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	after	all	 expense 	 s 	 	for	 aid 	 s 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.
we	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	breast	cancer	three	-	 day 	 s 	 	with	an	 initi 	 al 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	of	350,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	risk	capital	.
 with 	 in 	 	just	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	had	 multi 	 plied 	 	that	554	 time 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	194	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	after	all	 expense 	 s 	 	for	breast	cancer	research	.
now	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	 philanthro 	 pist 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	breast	cancer	,	what	would	make	more	sense	:	go	out	and	find	the	most	 innov 	 ative 	 	 research 	 er 	 	in	the	world	and	give	her	350,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	research	,	or	give	her	 fund 	 raising 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	the	350,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	 multi 	 ply 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	194	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	breast	cancer	research	?
2002	was	our	most	 success 	 ful 	 	year	ever	.
we	 nett 	 ed 	 	for	breast	cancer	 al 	 one 	 	,	that	year	 al 	 one 	 	,	71	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	after	all	 expense 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	went	out	of	business	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	and	traumatically	.
why	?	well	,	the	short	story	is	,	our	sponsor	split	on	us	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	distance	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	us	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 cruc 	 ified 	 	in	the	media	for	 invest 	 ing 	 	40	percent	of	the	gross	in	 recruit 	 ment 	 	and	 custom 	 er 	 	service	and	the	magic	of	the	experience	and	there	is	no	 account 	 ing 	 	 term 	 in 	 ology 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	that	kind	of	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	growth	and	in	the	future	,	other	than	 th 	 is 	 	 demo 	 nic 	 	label	of	 over 	 head 	 	.
so	on	one	day	,	all	350	of	our	great	 employ 	 ees 	 	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 label 	 ed 	 	 over 	 head 	 	.
our	sponsor	went	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	the	 event 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
the	 over 	 head 	 	went	up	.
net	income	for	breast	cancer	research	went	down	by	84	percent	,	or	60	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	one	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	 con 	 fuse 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	with	frugality	.
we	've	all	 be 	 en 	 	taught	that	the	bake	sale	with	five	percent	 over 	 head 	 	is	 moral 	 ly 	 	 super 	 ior 	 	to	the	professional	 fund 	 raising 	 	enterprise	with	40	percent	 over 	 head 	 	,	but	we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	piece	of	information	,	which	is	,	what	is	the	actual	 s 	 ize 	 	of	these	pies	?
who	 care 	 s 	 	if	the	bake	sale	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	five	percent	 over 	 head 	 	if	it	's	 tin 	 y 	 	?
what	if	the	bake	sale	 on 	 ly 	 	 nett 	 ed 	 	71	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	 char 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	made	no	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	scale	and	the	professional	 fund 	 raising 	 	enterprise	 nett 	 ed 	 	71	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	did	?
now	which	pie	would	we	prefer	,	and	which	pie	do	we	think	people	who	are	 hung 	 ry 	 	would	prefer	?
here	's	how	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	the	big	picture	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 char 	 it 	 able 	 	giving	is	two	percent	of	gdp	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
that	's	about	300	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.
but	 on 	 ly 	 	about	20	percent	of	that	,	or	60	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 go 	 es 	 	to	health	and	human	 service 	 s 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	.
the	rest	 go 	 es 	 	to	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	 high 	 er 	 	education	and	 hospital 	 s 	 	and	that	60	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	is	not	 near 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	tackle	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	if	we	could	move	 char 	 it 	 able 	 	giving	from	two	percent	of	gdp	up	just	one	step	to	three	percent	of	gdp	,	by	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	that	growth	,	that	would	be	an	extra	150	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	in	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	,	and	if	that	money	could	go	 dis 	 proportion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	to	health	and	human	 service 	 s 	 	 char 	 ities 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	 encourag 	 ed 	 	to	invest	in	 the 	 ir 	 	growth	,	that	would	represent	a	 trip 	 ling 	 	of	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	to	that	sector	.
now	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	scale	.
now	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	the	potential	for	real	change	.
but	it	's	never	going	to	happen	by	forcing	these	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	to	lower	 the 	 ir 	 	 horizon 	 s 	 	to	the	demoralizing	 object 	 ive 	 	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 over 	 head 	 	low	.
our	generation	 do 	 es 	 	not	want	 it 	 s 	 	epitaph	to	read	,	``	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	 over 	 head 	 	low	.	``
we	want	it	to	read	that	we	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	,	and	that	part	of	the	way	we	did	that	was	by	changing	the	way	we	think	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	the	next	time	you	're	looking	at	a	 char 	 ity 	 	,	do	n't	ask	about	the	rate	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 over 	 head 	 	.
ask	about	the	scale	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	apple	-	,	google	-	,	amazon	-	scale	 dream 	 s 	 	,	how	they	measure	 the 	 ir 	 	progress	 to 	 ward 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	,	and	what	 resource 	 s 	 	they	need	to	make	them	come	true	 regard 	 less 	 	of	what	the	 over 	 head 	 	is	.
who	 care 	 s 	 	what	the	 over 	 head 	 	is	if	these	 problem 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	?
if	we	can	have	that	kind	of	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	,	a	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	of	thought	,	then	the	non	-	profit	sector	can	play	a	massive	role	in	changing	the	world	for	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	most	 desperate 	 ly 	 	in	need	of	it	to	change	.
and	if	that	can	be	our	generation	's	 endur 	 ing 	 	 leg 	 acy 	 	,	that	we	took	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	the	 think 	 ing 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 hand 	 ed 	 	down	to	us	,	that	we	revisited	it	,	we	 revise 	 d 	 	it	,	and	we	 re 	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	whole	way	 human 	 ity 	 	 think 	 s 	 	about	changing	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	for	 every 	 one 	 	,	well	,	i	thought	i	would	let	the	 kid 	 s 	 	sum	up	what	that	would	be	.
annalisa	smith	-	pallotta	:	that	would	be	--	 s 	 age 	 	smith	-	pallotta	:	--	a	real	social	--	rider	smith	-	pallotta	:	--	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
