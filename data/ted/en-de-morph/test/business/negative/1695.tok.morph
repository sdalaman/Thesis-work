chris	anderson	:	elon	,	what	kind	of	crazy	dream	would	 persuad 	 e 	 	you	to	think	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	on	the	auto	industry	and	build	an	all	-	electric	car	?
elon	musk	:	well	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	when	i	was	in	university	.
i	thought	about	,	what	are	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	most	 like 	 ly 	 	to	affect	the	future	of	the	world	or	the	future	of	 human 	 ity 	 	?
i	think	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	have	 sustain 	 able 	 	transport	and	 sustain 	 able 	 	energy	production	.
that	sort	of	 over 	 all 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	energy	problem	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	problem	that	we	have	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	century	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	of	 environment 	 al 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	even	if	producing	co	2	was	good	for	the	environment	,	 give 	 n 	 	that	we	're	going	to	run	out	of	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	find	some	 sustain 	 able 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 oper 	 ating 	 	.
ca	:	most	of	american	 electric 	 ity 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	 burn 	 ing 	 	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
how	can	an	electric	car	that	 plug 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	 electric 	 ity 	 	help	?
em	:	right	.	there	's	two	 element 	 s 	 	to	that	answer	.
one	is	that	,	even	if	you	take	the	same	source	fuel	and	produce	power	at	the	power	plant	and	use	it	to	charge	electric	 car 	 s 	 	,	you	're	still	better	off	.
so	if	you	take	,	say	,	natural	gas	,	which	is	the	most	 pre 	 valent 	 	 hydro 	 carbon 	 	source	fuel	,	if	you	burn	that	in	a	modern	general	electric	natural	gas	turbine	,	you	'll	get	about	60	percent	efficiency	.
if	you	put	that	same	fuel	in	an	internal	 com 	 bust 	 ion 	 	engine	car	,	you	get	about	20	percent	efficiency	.
and	the	reason	is	,	in	the	 station 	 ary 	 	power	plant	,	you	can	afford	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 weigh 	 s 	 	a	lot	more	,	is	 volu 	 min 	 ous 	 	,	and	you	can	take	the	waste	heat	and	run	a	 s 	 team 	 	turbine	and	generate	a	 second 	 ary 	 	power	source	.
so	in	effect	,	even	after	you	've	taken	 trans 	 mission 	 	loss	 in 	 to 	 	account	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	even	using	the	same	source	fuel	,	you	're	at	 l 	 east 	 	twice	 a 	 s 	 	better	off	charging	an	electric	car	,	then	 burn 	 ing 	 	it	at	the	power	plant	.
ca	:	that	scale	 deliver 	 s 	 	efficiency	.
em	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	then	the	other	point	is	,	we	have	to	have	 sustain 	 able 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	of	power	generation	 any 	 way 	 	,	 electric 	 ity 	 	generation	.
so	 give 	 n 	 	that	we	have	to	solve	 sustain 	 able 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	generation	,	then	it	 make 	 s 	 	sense	for	us	to	have	electric	 car 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	mode	of	transport	.
ca	:	so	we	've	got	some	video	here	of	the	tesla	 be 	 ing 	 	 assemble 	 d 	 	,	which	,	if	we	could	play	that	first	video	--	so	what	is	 innov 	 ative 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	process	in	 th 	 is 	 	vehicle	?
em	:	 s 	 ure 	 	.	so	,	in	order	to	 accele 	 rate 	 	the	 ad 	 vent 	 	of	electric	transport	,	and	i	should	say	that	i	think	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	all	 mode 	 s 	 	of	transport	will	 be 	 come 	 	fully	electric	with	the	 iron 	 ic 	 	exception	of	 rocket 	 s 	 	.
there	's	just	no	way	around	newton	's	third	law	.
the	question	is	how	do	you	 accele 	 rate 	 	the	 ad 	 vent 	 	of	electric	transport	?
and	in	order	to	do	that	for	 car 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	come	up	with	a	 re 	 ally 	 	energy	efficient	car	,	so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	making	it	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	light	,	and	so	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	all	-	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	body	and	 cha 	 s 	 sis 	 	car	made	in	north	america	.
in	fact	,	we	 appli 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	rocket	design	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	make	the	car	light	 de 	 spite 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 batt 	 ery 	 	pack	.
and	then	it	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 low 	 est 	 	drag	 co 	 efficient 	 	of	any	car	of	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	the	energy	 us 	 age 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	low	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	most	 advance 	 d 	 	 batt 	 ery 	 	pack	,	and	that	's	what	 give 	 s 	 	it	the	range	that	's	competitive	,	so	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	on	the	order	of	a	250	-	mile	range	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 batt 	 ery 	 	 pack 	 s 	 	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	heavy	,	but	you	think	the	math	can	still	work	out	 intelligent 	 ly 	 	--	by	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	light	body	,	heavy	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	you	can	still	gain	spectacular	efficiency	.
em	:	 exact 	 ly 	 	.	the	rest	of	the	car	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	light	to	 off 	 set 	 	the	mass	of	the	pack	,	and	then	you	have	to	have	a	low	drag	 co 	 efficient 	 	so	that	you	have	good	 high 	 way 	 	range	.
and	in	fact	,	 custom 	 ers 	 	of	the	model	s	are	sort	of	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	each	other	to	try	to	get	the	highest	possible	range	.
i	think	 some 	 body 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	got	420	 mile 	 s 	 	out	of	a	single	charge	.
ca	:	bruno	bowden	,	who	's	here	,	did	that	,	broke	the	world	record	.	em	:	 congratula 	 tions 	 	.
ca	:	that	was	the	good	news	.	the	bad	news	was	that	to	do	it	,	he	had	to	drive	at	18	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	constant	speed	and	got	 pull 	 ed 	 	over	by	the	 cop 	 s 	 	.
em	:	i	mean	,	you	can	 certain 	 ly 	 	drive	--	if	you	drive	it	65	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	under	normal	 condition 	 s 	 	,	250	 mile 	 s 	 	is	a	 reason 	 able 	 	number	.
ca	:	let	's	show	that	second	video	 show 	 ing 	 	the	tesla	in	action	on	ice	.
not	at	all	a	dig	at	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	,	by	the	way	.
what	is	the	most	surprising	thing	about	the	experience	of	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	car	?
em	:	in	creating	an	electric	car	,	the	 respons 	 ive 	 ness 	 	of	the	car	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
so	we	 want 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	to	have	people	feel	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	've	 al 	 most 	 	got	to	mind	meld	with	the	car	,	so	you	just	feel	like	you	and	the	car	are	kind	of	one	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	corner	and	 accele 	 rate 	 	,	it	just	 happen 	 s 	 	,	like	the	car	 ha 	 s 	 	esp	.
you	can	do	that	with	an	electric	car	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 respons 	 ive 	 ness 	 	.
you	ca	n't	do	that	with	a	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	car	.
i	think	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	people	 on 	 ly 	 	experience	that	when	they	have	a	test	drive	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	but	expensive	car	.
is	there	a	road	map	where	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	mass	-	market	vehicle	?
em	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	the	goal	of	tesla	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	have	a	sort	of	three	-	step	process	,	where	version	one	was	an	expensive	car	at	low	volume	,	version	two	is	medium	priced	and	medium	volume	,	and	then	version	three	would	be	low	price	,	high	volume	.
so	we	're	at	step	two	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
so	we	had	a	$	100,000	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	car	,	which	was	the	roadster	.
then	we	've	got	the	model	s	,	which	 start 	 s 	 	at	around	50,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	our	third	generation	car	,	which	should	 hope 	 fully 	 	be	out	in	about	three	or	four	 year 	 s 	 	will	be	a	$	30,000	car	.
but	 when 	 ever 	 	you	've	got	 re 	 ally 	 	new	technology	,	it	 general 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	about	three	major	 version 	 s 	 	in	order	to	make	it	a	 compel 	 ling 	 	mass	-	market	product	.
and	so	i	think	we	're	making	progress	in	that	direction	,	and	i	feel	confident	that	we	'll	get	there	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	right	now	,	if	you	've	got	a	short	commute	,	you	can	drive	,	you	can	get	back	,	you	can	charge	it	at	home	.
there	is	n't	a	huge	 nation 	 wide 	 	network	of	charging	 station 	 s 	 	now	that	are	fast	.
do	you	see	that	coming	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	or	just	on	a	few	key	 route 	 s 	 	?
em	:	there	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	far	more	charging	 station 	 s 	 	than	people	 real 	 ize 	 	,	and	at	tesla	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 super 	 charging 	 	technology	,	and	we	're	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	that	if	you	buy	a	model	s	for	free	,	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	california	and	nevada	 cover 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	've	got	the	eastern	 sea 	 board 	 	from	boston	to	d.c.	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	you	'll	be	able	to	drive	from	l.a.	to	new	york	just	using	the	supercharger	network	,	which	 charge 	 s 	 	at	five	 time 	 s 	 	the	rate	of	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	the	key	thing	is	to	have	a	ratio	of	drive	to	stop	,	to	stop	time	,	of	about	six	or	seven	.
so	if	you	drive	for	three	 hour 	 s 	 	,	you	want	to	stop	for	20	or	30	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 normal 	 ly 	 	what	people	will	stop	for	.
so	if	you	start	a	trip	at	9	 a.m 	 . 	 	,	by	noon	you	want	to	stop	to	have	a	bite	to	eat	,	hit	the	 rest 	 room 	 	,	coffee	,	and	keep	going	.
ca	:	so	your	 pro 	 position 	 	to	 consumer 	 s 	 	is	,	for	the	full	charge	,	it	could	take	an	hour	.
so	it	's	common	--	do	n't	expect	to	be	out	of	here	in	10	 minute 	 s 	 	.
wait	for	an	hour	,	but	the	good	news	is	,	you	're	 help 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	the	planet	,	and	by	the	way	,	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	is	free	.	you	do	n't	pay	 any 	 thing 	 	.
em	:	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	we	're	 expect 	 ing 	 	is	for	people	to	stop	for	about	20	to	30	 minute 	 s 	 	,	not	for	an	hour	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	better	to	drive	for	about	 may 	 be 	 	160	,	170	 mile 	 s 	 	and	then	stop	for	half	an	hour	and	then	keep	going	.
that	's	the	natural	 cad 	 ence 	 	of	a	trip	.
ca	:	all	right	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	string	to	your	energy	bow	.
you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	solar	company	solarcity	.
what	's	 un 	 usual 	 	about	that	?
em	:	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	we	have	to	have	 sustain 	 able 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	production	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	consumption	,	so	i	'm	 quit 	 e 	 	confident	that	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	of	power	generation	will	be	solar	.
i	mean	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 direct 	 	fusion	,	is	what	it	is	.
we	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	giant	fusion	 gene 	 rator 	 	in	the	sky	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	and	we	just	need	to	tap	a	little	bit	of	that	energy	for	 purpose 	 s 	 	of	human	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
what	most	people	know	but	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	they	know	is	that	the	world	is	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	solar	-	powered	 al 	 ready 	 	.
if	the	 s 	 un 	 	was	n't	there	,	we	'd	be	a	 froze 	 n 	 	ice	ball	at	three	 degree 	 s 	 	kelvin	,	and	the	 s 	 un 	 	 power 	 s 	 	the	entire	system	of	 precipit 	 ation 	 	.
the	whole	 eco 	 system 	 	is	solar	-	powered	.
ca	:	but	in	a	gallon	of	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	,	you	have	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 	power	 compress 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	small	space	,	so	it	's	hard	to	make	the	 number 	 s 	 	work	right	now	on	solar	,	and	to	 remote 	 ly 	 	compete	with	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	natural	gas	,	fracked	natural	gas	.	how	are	you	going	to	build	a	business	here	?
em	:	well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	confident	that	solar	will	beat	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 hand 	 s 	 	down	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	natural	gas	.
ca	:	how	?
em	:	it	must	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	,	we	're	in	deep	trouble	.
ca	:	but	you	're	not	selling	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	to	 consumer 	 s 	 	.
what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
em	:	no	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	.	you	can	buy	a	solar	system	or	you	can	lease	a	solar	system	.
most	people	 choos 	 e 	 	to	lease	.
and	the	thing	about	solar	power	is	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	feed	stock	or	 operation 	 al 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	,	so	once	it	's	 install 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	just	there	.
it	 work 	 s 	 	for	 decade 	 s 	 	.	it	'll	work	for	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	century	.
so	 there 	 fore 	 	,	the	key	thing	to	do	is	to	get	the	cost	of	that	 initi 	 al 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	low	,	and	then	get	the	cost	of	the	 fin 	 anc 	 ing 	 	low	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	interest	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	two	 factor 	 s 	 	that	drive	the	cost	of	solar	.
and	we	've	made	huge	progress	in	that	direction	,	and	that	's	why	i	'm	confident	we	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	beat	natural	gas	.
ca	:	so	your	current	 pro 	 position 	 	to	 consumer 	 s 	 	is	,	do	n't	pay	so	much	up	front	.
em	:	zero	.	ca	:	pay	zero	up	front	.
we	will	install	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	on	your	roof	.
you	will	then	pay	,	how	long	is	a	typical	lease	?
em	:	typical	 lease 	 s 	 	are	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	the	value	 pro 	 position 	 	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	sort	of	 allud 	 ing 	 	to	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	.
it	's	no	money	down	,	and	your	 util 	 ity 	 	bill	 de 	 crease 	 s 	 	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	good	deal	.
ca	:	so	that	 seem 	 s 	 	like	a	win	for	the	consumer	.
no	risk	,	you	'll	pay	less	than	you	're	 pay 	 ing 	 	now	.
for	you	,	the	dream	here	then	is	that	--	i	mean	,	who	 own 	 s 	 	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	for	the	 long 	 er 	 	term	?
i	mean	,	how	do	you	,	the	company	,	benefit	?
em	:	well	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	solarcity	 raise 	 s 	 	a	chunk	of	capital	from	say	,	a	company	or	a	bank	.
google	is	one	of	our	big	 partner 	 s 	 	here	.
and	they	have	an	 expect 	 ed 	 	return	on	that	capital	.
with	that	capital	,	solarcity	 purchase 	 s 	 	and	installs	the	 pan 	 el 	 	on	the	roof	and	then	 charge 	 s 	 	the	homeowner	or	business	owner	a	 month 	 ly 	 	lease	payment	,	which	is	less	than	the	 util 	 ity 	 	bill	.
ca	:	but	you	 your 	 self 	 	get	a	long	-	term	commercial	benefit	from	that	power	.
you	're	kind	of	building	a	new	type	of	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 util 	 ity 	 	.
em	:	 exact 	 ly 	 	.	what	it	 amount 	 s 	 	to	is	a	giant	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 util 	 ity 	 	.
i	think	it	's	a	good	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 util 	 ities 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 monopol 	 y 	 	,	and	people	have	n't	had	any	choice	.
so	 effective 	 ly 	 	it	's	the	first	time	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 monopol 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 util 	 ities 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	owned	 t 	 hose 	 	power	 distribut 	 ion 	 	lines	,	but	now	it	's	on	your	roof	.
so	i	think	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 empower 	 ing 	 	for	 home 	 owner 	 s 	 	and	 business 	 es 	 	.
ca	:	and	you	 re 	 ally 	 	picture	a	future	where	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	power	in	america	,	 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	or	two	,	or	 with 	 in 	 	your	 life 	 time 	 	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	solar	?
em	:	i	'm	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	confident	that	solar	will	be	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	 plural 	 ity 	 	of	power	,	and	most	 like 	 ly 	 	a	 major 	 ity 	 	,	and	i	predict	it	will	be	a	 plural 	 ity 	 	in	less	than	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	made	that	bet	with	 some 	 one 	 	--	ca	:	definition	of	 plural 	 ity 	 	is	?
em	:	more	from	solar	than	any	other	source	.
ca	:	ah	.	who	did	you	make	the	bet	with	?
em	:	with	a	friend	who	will	remain	 name 	 less 	 	.
ca	:	just	between	us	.
em	:	i	made	that	bet	,	i	think	,	two	or	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	so	in	 rough 	 ly 	 	18	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	think	we	'll	see	more	power	from	solar	than	any	other	source	.
ca	:	all	right	,	so	let	's	go	back	to	 an 	 other 	 	bet	that	you	made	with	 your 	 self 	 	,	i	guess	,	a	kind	of	crazy	bet	.
you	'd	made	some	money	from	the	sale	of	paypal	.
you	 decide 	 d 	 	to	build	a	space	company	.
why	on	earth	would	 some 	 one 	 	do	that	?
em	:	i	got	that	question	a	lot	,	that	's	true	.
people	would	say	,	``	did	you	hear	the	joke	about	the	guy	who	made	a	small	fortune	in	the	space	industry	?	``
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	``	he	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	large	one	,	``	is	the	 punch 	 line 	 	.
and	so	i	tell	people	,	well	,	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	the	 fast 	 est 	 	way	to	turn	a	large	fortune	 in 	 to 	 	a	small	one	.
and	they	'd	look	at	me	,	like	,	``	is	he	serious	?	``
ca	:	and	 strange 	 ly 	 	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	.	so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
em	:	it	was	a	close	call	.	 thing 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	did	n't	work	out	.
we	came	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	failure	,	but	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	through	that	point	in	2008	.
the	goal	of	spacex	is	to	try	to	advance	rocket	technology	,	and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	to	try	to	crack	a	problem	that	i	think	is	vital	for	 human 	 ity 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	space	-	faring	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	which	is	to	have	a	 rapid 	 ly 	 	and	fully	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	rocket	.
ca	:	would	 human 	 ity 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	space	-	faring	 civil 	 ization 	 	?
so	that	was	a	dream	of	 your 	 s 	 	,	in	a	way	,	from	a	young	age	?
you	've	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	mars	and	beyond	?
em	:	i	did	build	 rocket 	 s 	 	when	i	was	a	kid	,	but	i	did	n't	think	i	'd	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	more	from	the	 stand 	 point 	 	of	what	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	need	to	happen	in	order	for	the	future	to	be	an	 excit 	 ing 	 	and	inspiring	one	?
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	there	's	a	fundamental	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	if	you	sort	of	look	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,	between	a	 human 	 ity 	 	that	is	a	space	-	faring	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	that	's	out	there	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	 star 	 s 	 	,	on	 multi 	 ple 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	one	where	we	are	 fore 	 ver 	 	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	to	earth	 un 	 til 	 	some	 event 	 ual 	 	 extinct 	 ion 	 	event	.
ca	:	so	you	've	 some 	 how 	 	 s 	 lash 	 ed 	 	the	cost	of	building	a	rocket	by	75	percent	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	you	 calcul 	 ate 	 	it	.
how	on	earth	have	you	 d 	 one 	 	that	?
nasa	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	.	how	have	you	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
em	:	well	,	we	've	made	significant	 advance 	 s 	 	in	the	technology	of	the	airframe	,	the	 engine 	 s 	 	,	the	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	the	launch	operation	.
there	's	a	long	list	of	 innov 	 ations 	 	that	we	've	come	up	with	there	that	are	a	little	difficult	to	communicate	in	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	but	--	ca	:	not	 l 	 east 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	could	still	get	 cop 	 ied 	 	,	right	?
you	have	n't	 patent 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
em	:	no	,	we	do	n't	patent	.	ca	:	you	did	n't	patent	 be 	 cause 	 	you	think	it	's	more	 danger 	 ous 	 	to	patent	than	not	to	patent	.
em	:	since	our	 prim 	 ary 	 	 competitor 	 s 	 	are	national	 government 	 s 	 	,	the	enforceability	of	 patent 	 s 	 	is	 question 	 able 	 	.
ca	:	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
but	the	big	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	still	 a 	 head 	 	,	and	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	now	.	tell	us	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
em	:	right	,	so	the	big	 innov 	 ation 	 	--	ca	:	in	fact	,	let	's	roll	that	video	and	you	can	talk	us	through	it	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.
em	:	 absolute 	 ly 	 	.	so	the	thing	about	 rocket 	 s 	 	is	that	they	're	all	 expend 	 able 	 	.
all	 rocket 	 s 	 	that	fly	 to 	 day 	 	are	fully	 expend 	 able 	 	.
the	space	shuttle	was	an	attempt	at	a	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	rocket	,	but	even	the	main	tank	of	the	space	shuttle	was	 throw 	 n 	 	away	every	time	,	and	the	 part 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	took	a	10,000	-	person	group	nine	 month 	 s 	 	to	refurbish	for	flight	.
so	the	space	shuttle	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 cost 	 ing 	 	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	flight	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 ver 	 y 	 	well	for	--	ca	:	what	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	?	we	just	saw	 some 	 thing 	 	land	?
em	:	that	's	right	.	so	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	the	rocket	 stage 	 s 	 	be	able	to	come	back	,	to	be	able	to	return	to	the	launch	 s 	 ite 	 	and	be	ready	to	launch	 aga 	 in 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	matter	of	 hour 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	 w 	 ow 	 	.	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	 rocket 	 s 	 	.	em	:	 y 	 es 	 	.
and	so	what	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	is	,	the	cost	of	the	fuel	,	of	the	 propel 	 l 	 ant 	 	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	small	.
it	's	much	like	on	a	jet	.
so	the	cost	of	the	 propel 	 l 	 ant 	 	is	about	.3	percent	of	the	cost	of	the	rocket	.
so	it	's	possible	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	,	let	's	say	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	100	-	fold	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	the	cost	of	 space 	 flight 	 	if	you	can	 effective 	 ly 	 	 re 	 use 	 	the	rocket	.
that	's	why	it	's	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.
every	mode	of	transport	that	we	use	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 plane 	 s 	 	,	 train 	 s 	 	,	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	,	 bike 	 s 	 	,	 horse 	 s 	 	,	is	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	,	but	not	 rocket 	 s 	 	.
so	we	must	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	in	order	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	space	-	faring	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
ca	:	you	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	the	question	 ear 	 lier 	 	of	how	popular	 travel 	 ing 	 	on	cruises	would	be	if	you	had	to	burn	your	 ship 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 	.	em	:	certain	cruises	are	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 problem 	 atic 	 	.
ca	:	 definite 	 ly 	 	more	expensive	.
so	that	's	 potential 	 ly 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	technology	,	and	,	i	guess	,	 pave 	 s 	 	the	way	for	your	dream	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	,	at	some	point	,	to	take	 human 	 ity 	 	to	mars	at	scale	.
you	'd	like	to	see	a	 colon 	 y 	 	on	mars	.
em	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	.	spacex	,	or	some	combination	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 government 	 s 	 	,	 need 	 s 	 	to	make	progress	in	the	direction	of	making	life	multi	-	planetary	,	of	 establish 	 ing 	 	a	base	on	 an 	 other 	 	planet	,	on	mars	--	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	realistic	option	--	and	then	building	that	base	up	 un 	 til 	 	we	're	a	true	multi	-	planet	species	.
ca	:	so	progress	on	 th 	 is 	 	``	let	's	make	it	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	,	``	how	is	that	going	?	that	was	just	a	 simul 	 ation 	 	video	we	saw	.
how	's	it	going	?
em	:	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	making	some	good	progress	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	we	call	the	 grass 	 hopper 	 	test	project	,	where	we	're	 test 	 ing 	 	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	 land 	 ing 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	of	the	flight	,	the	sort	of	terminal	 port 	 ion 	 	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 trick 	 y 	 	.
and	we	've	had	some	good	 test 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	can	we	see	that	?	em	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
so	that	's	just	to	give	a	sense	of	scale	.
we	 dress 	 ed 	 	a	 cow 	 boy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	johnny	cash	and	 bolt 	 ed 	 	the	 mann 	 equ 	 in 	 	to	the	rocket	.
ca	:	all	right	,	let	's	see	that	video	then	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	when	you	think	about	it	.
you	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	.	a	rocket	blasting	off	and	then	--	em	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	so	that	rocket	is	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	12	-	story	building	.
so	now	it	's	 hover 	 ing 	 	at	about	40	 meter 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 constant 	 ly 	 	 adjust 	 ing 	 	the	angle	,	the	pitch	and	yaw	of	the	main	engine	,	and	 maintain 	 ing 	 	roll	with	coal	gas	 thrust 	 ers 	 	.
ca	:	how	cool	is	that	?
elon	,	how	have	you	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
these	 project 	 s 	 	are	so	--	paypal	,	solarcity	,	tesla	,	spacex	,	they	're	so	 spectacular 	 ly 	 	different	,	they	're	 s 	 uch 	 	 ambit 	 ious 	 	 project 	 s 	 	at	scale	.
how	on	earth	 ha 	 s 	 	one	person	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	?
what	is	it	about	you	?
em	:	i	do	n't	know	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	a	good	answer	for	you	.
i	work	a	lot	.	i	mean	,	a	lot	.
ca	:	well	,	i	have	a	 theor 	 y 	 	.	em	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	all	right	.
ca	:	my	 theor 	 y 	 	is	that	you	have	an	ability	to	think	at	a	system	level	of	design	that	 pull 	 s 	 	together	design	,	technology	and	business	,	so	if	ted	was	tbd	,	design	,	technology	and	business	,	 in 	 to 	 	one	package	,	synthesize	it	in	a	way	that	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	can	and	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	critical	thing	--	feel	so	damn	confident	in	that	 click 	 ed 	 	-	together	package	that	you	take	crazy	 risk 	 s 	 	.
you	bet	your	fortune	on	it	,	and	you	seem	to	have	 d 	 one 	 	that	 multi 	 ple 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	 al 	 most 	 	no	one	can	do	that	.
is	that	--	could	we	have	some	of	that	secret	sauce	?
can	we	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	our	education	system	?	can	 some 	 one 	 	learn	from	you	?
it	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	what	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
em	:	well	,	 thank 	 s 	 	.	thank	you	.
well	,	i	do	think	there	's	a	good	 frame 	 work 	 	for	 think 	 ing 	 	.
it	is	physics	.	you	know	,	the	sort	of	first	 principle 	 s 	 	 reason 	 ing 	 	.
 general 	 ly 	 	i	think	there	are	--	what	i	mean	by	that	is	,	boil	 thing 	 s 	 	down	to	 the 	 ir 	 	fundamental	 truth 	 s 	 	and	reason	up	from	there	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 reason 	 ing 	 	by	 analog 	 y 	 	.
through	most	of	our	life	,	we	get	through	life	by	 reason 	 ing 	 	by	 analog 	 y 	 	,	which	 essential 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 copy 	 ing 	 	what	other	people	do	with	 s 	 light 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	.
and	you	have	to	do	that	.
 other 	 wise 	 	,	 ment 	 ally 	 	,	you	would	n't	be	able	to	get	through	the	day	.
but	when	you	want	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	new	,	you	have	to	 app 	 ly 	 	the	physics	approach	.
physics	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	discover	new	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	,	like	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	.
so	i	think	that	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	do	,	and	then	 al 	 so 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	pay	attention	to	negative	 feed 	 back 	 	,	and	solicit	it	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	from	 friend 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	sound	like	simple	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	but	 hard 	 ly 	 	 any 	 one 	 	 do 	 es 	 	that	,	and	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	.
ca	:	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	 stud 	 y 	 	physics	.
learn	from	 th 	 is 	 	man	.
elon	musk	,	i	wish	we	had	all	day	,	but	thank	you	so	much	for	coming	to	ted	.
em	:	thank	you	.	ca	:	that	was	awesome	.	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
look	at	that	.
just	take	a	bow	.	that	was	fantastic	.
thank	you	so	much	.
