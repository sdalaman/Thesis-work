so	,	i	'm	an	artist	.
i	live	in	new	york	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	for	--	ever	since	i	left	school	,	so	about	seven	,	eight	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	and	it	was	 drain 	 ing 	 	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	late	 night 	 s 	 	.	i	 work 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	,	and	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	never	 hav 	 ing 	 	time	for	all	the	 project 	 s 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	work	on	on	my	own	.
and	one	day	i	was	at	work	and	i	saw	a	talk	by	stefan	sagmeister	on	ted	,	and	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	power	of	time	off	,	``	and	he	spoke	about	how	every	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	he	 take 	 s 	 	a	year	off	from	work	so	he	could	do	his	own	creative	 project 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	 instant 	 ly 	 	inspired	,	and	i	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	to	do	that	.	i	have	to	take	a	year	off	.
i	need	to	take	time	to	travel	and	 s 	 pend 	 	time	with	my	family	and	start	my	own	creative	 idea 	 s 	 	.	``
so	the	first	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 project 	 s 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	i	 call 	 ed 	 	``	one	second	every	day	.	``
 bas 	 ically 	 	i	'm	 record 	 ing 	 	one	second	of	every	day	of	my	life	for	the	rest	of	my	life	,	 chrono 	 logically 	 	 compil 	 ing 	 	these	one	-	second	 tin 	 y 	 	 slice 	 s 	 	of	my	life	 in 	 to 	 	one	single	 continu 	 ous 	 	video	 un 	 til 	 	,	you	know	,	i	ca	n't	record	them	 any 	 more 	 	.
the	purpose	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	,	one	:	i	hate	not	 remember 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	past	.
there	's	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	with	my	life	that	i	have	no	 re 	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 un 	 less 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	it	up	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	think	,	``	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	did	.	``
and	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	 real 	 ized 	 	early	on	in	the	project	was	that	if	i	was	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	i	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	forget	to	record	the	video	.
so	the	day	--	the	first	time	that	i	 for 	 got 	 	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	hurt	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	--	from	the	moment	that	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	30	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	keep	 th 	 is 	 	project	going	 un 	 til 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	that	one	second	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	it	just	kind	of	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	in	my	head	where	i	never	 for 	 got 	 	ever	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	if	i	live	to	see	80	 year 	 s 	 	of	age	,	i	'm	going	to	have	a	five	-	hour	video	that	 encapsul 	 ates 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	of	my	life	.
when	i	turn	40	,	i	'll	have	a	one	-	hour	video	that	 include 	 s 	 	just	my	30s	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 invigo 	 rated 	 	me	day	-	to	-	day	,	when	i	wake	up	,	to	try	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	with	my	day	.
now	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	have	 issue 	 s 	 	with	is	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 day 	 s 	 	and	 week 	 s 	 	and	 month 	 s 	 	go	by	,	time	just	 seem 	 s 	 	to	start	 blur 	 ring 	 	and	 blend 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	each	other	and	,	you	know	,	i	 hat 	 ed 	 	that	,	and	 visual 	 ization 	 	is	the	way	to	trigger	 memor 	 y 	 	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	project	for	me	is	a	way	for	me	to	bridge	that	gap	and	remember	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
even	just	 th 	 is 	 	one	second	 allow 	 s 	 	me	to	remember	 every 	 thing 	 	else	i	did	that	one	day	.
it	's	difficult	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	to	pick	that	one	second	.
on	a	good	day	,	i	'll	have	 may 	 be 	 	three	or	four	 second 	 s 	 	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	 choos 	 e 	 	,	but	i	'll	just	have	to	narrow	it	down	to	one	,	but	even	 narrow 	 ing 	 	it	down	to	that	one	 allow 	 s 	 	me	to	remember	the	other	three	 any 	 way 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	kind	of	a	protest	,	a	personal	protest	,	against	the	culture	we	have	now	where	people	just	are	at	 concert 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	out	 record 	 ing 	 	the	whole	concert	,	and	they	're	 disturb 	 ing 	 	you	.
they	're	not	even	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	show	.
they	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	concert	through	 the 	 ir 	 	cell	phone	.
i	hate	that	.	i	 admitted 	 ly 	 	used	to	be	that	guy	a	little	bit	,	back	in	the	day	,	and	i	've	 decide 	 d 	 	that	the	best	way	for	me	to	still	capture	and	keep	a	visual	 memor 	 y 	 	of	my	life	and	not	be	that	person	,	is	to	just	record	that	one	second	that	will	allow	me	to	trigger	that	 memor 	 y 	 	of	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	concert	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 d 	 	that	concert	.	``
and	it	just	 take 	 s 	 	a	quick	,	quick	second	.
i	was	on	a	three	-	month	road	trip	 th 	 is 	 	summer	.
it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 dream 	 ing 	 	about	 do 	 ing 	 	my	whole	life	,	just	 driv 	 ing 	 	around	the	u.s.	and	canada	and	just	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	where	to	go	the	next	day	,	and	it	was	kind	of	 out 	 stand 	 ing 	 	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	ran	out	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	too	much	money	on	my	road	trip	for	the	 saving 	 s 	 	that	i	had	to	take	my	year	off	,	so	i	had	to	,	i	went	to	seattle	and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	some	time	with	 friend 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	 re 	 ally 	 	neat	project	.
one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	that	i	took	my	year	off	was	to	 s 	 pend 	 	more	time	with	my	family	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	tragic	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	where	my	sister	-	in	-	law	,	her	intestine	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 strangle 	 d 	 	one	day	,	and	we	took	her	to	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	,	and	she	was	,	she	was	in	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	shape	.
we	 al 	 most 	 	lost	her	a	couple	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	there	with	my	brother	every	day	.
it	 help 	 ed 	 	me	 real 	 ize 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	is	that	 record 	 ing 	 	that	one	second	on	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	day	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	difficult	.
it	's	not	--	we	tend	to	take	our	 camera 	 s 	 	out	when	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	awesome	 thing 	 s 	 	.
or	we	're	,	``	oh	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	party	,	let	me	take	a	picture	.	``
but	we	 rare 	 ly 	 	do	that	when	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	bad	day	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	found	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	record	even	just	that	one	second	of	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	moment	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	you	appreciate	the	good	 time 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 al 	 ways 	 	a	good	day	,	so	when	you	have	a	bad	one	,	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remember	it	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remember	the	[	good	]	 day 	 s 	 	.
now	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	do	is	i	do	n't	use	any	 filter 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	use	 any 	 thing 	 	to	--	i	try	to	capture	the	moment	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	possible	 a 	 s 	 	the	way	that	i	saw	it	with	my	own	 eye 	 s 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	rule	of	first	person	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
early	on	,	i	think	i	had	a	couple	of	 video 	 s 	 	where	you	would	see	me	in	it	,	but	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	was	n't	the	way	to	go	.
the	way	to	 re 	 ally 	 	remember	what	i	saw	was	to	record	it	 a 	 s 	 	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	saw	it	.
now	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	have	in	my	head	about	 th 	 is 	 	project	are	,	would	n't	it	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	if	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
i	 turn 	 ed 	 	31	last	week	,	which	is	there	.
i	think	it	would	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	see	what	 every 	 one 	 	did	with	a	project	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	think	 every 	 one 	 	would	have	a	different	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	it	.
i	think	 every 	 one 	 	would	benefit	from	just	 hav 	 ing 	 	that	one	second	to	remember	every	day	.
 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 forget 	 ting 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	thing	to	do	.
i	mean	,	we	all	have	hd	-	 cap 	 able 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	in	our	 pocket 	 s 	 	right	now	--	most	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	i	bet	--	and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	--	i	never	want	to	forget	 an 	 other 	 	day	that	i	've	ever	lived	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	and	it	'd	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 al 	 so 	 	to	see	,	if	you	could	just	type	in	on	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	``	june	18	,	2018	,	``	and	you	would	just	see	a	stream	of	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	on	that	 part 	 icular 	 	day	from	all	over	the	world	.
and	i	do	n't	know	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	project	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 possibil 	 ities 	 	,	and	i	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	all	to	record	just	a	small	 snip 	 pet 	 	of	your	life	every	day	,	so	you	can	never	forget	that	that	day	,	you	lived	.
thank	you	.
