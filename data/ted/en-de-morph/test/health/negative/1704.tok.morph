 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	you	an	electric	vehicle	that	 weigh 	 s 	 	less	than	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	that	you	can	carry	with	you	 any 	 where 	 	,	that	you	can	charge	off	a	normal	wall	 out 	 let 	 	in	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	run	it	for	1,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	on	about	a	dollar	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
but	when	i	say	the	word	electric	vehicle	,	people	think	about	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.	they	think	about	 car 	 s 	 	and	 motor 	 cycle 	 s 	 	and	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 vehicle 	 s 	 	that	you	use	every	day	.
but	if	you	come	about	it	from	a	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	you	can	create	some	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	more	novel	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
so	we	built	 some 	 thing 	 	.
i	've	got	some	of	the	 piece 	 s 	 	in	my	pocket	here	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	motor	.
 th 	 is 	 	motor	 ha 	 s 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	power	to	take	you	up	the	 hill 	 s 	 	of	san	francisco	at	about	20	 mile 	 s 	 	per	hour	,	about	30	 kilometer 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 batt 	 ery 	 	right	here	 ha 	 s 	 	about	six	 mile 	 s 	 	of	range	,	or	10	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 en 	 ough 	 	to	cover	about	half	of	the	car	 trip 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	 al 	 one 	 	.
but	the	best	part	about	these	 component 	 s 	 	is	that	we	 b 	 ought 	 	them	at	a	 to 	 y 	 	store	.
these	are	from	remote	control	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
and	the	performance	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	so	good	that	if	you	think	about	 vehicle 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	 different 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	change	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	we	're	going	to	show	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	you	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	.
pay	attention	to	not	 on 	 ly 	 	how	 f 	 un 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	how	the	portability	that	 come 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	can	 total 	 ly 	 	change	the	way	you	interact	with	a	city	like	san	francisco	.
[	6	mile	range	]	[	top	speed	near	20mph	]	[	 up 	 hill 	 	 climb 	 ing 	 	]	[	 re 	 generative 	 	 bra 	 king 	 	]	so	we	're	going	to	show	you	what	 th 	 is 	 	thing	can	do	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	maneuverable	.	you	have	a	hand	-	held	remote	,	so	you	can	 pre 	 tty 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	control	 accele 	 ration 	 	,	 bra 	 king 	 	,	go	in	reverse	if	you	like	,	 al 	 so 	 	have	 bra 	 king 	 	.
it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	just	how	light	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	can	pick	up	and	carry	with	you	 any 	 where 	 	you	go	.
so	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	one	of	the	most	 compel 	 ling 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	technology	and	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	uses	20	 time 	 s 	 	less	energy	for	every	mile	or	kilometer	that	you	travel	than	a	car	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	thing	fast	to	charge	and	 re 	 ally 	 	cheap	to	build	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 reduc 	 es 	 	the	 foot 	 print 	 	of	your	energy	use	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	your	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	looking	at	large	 amount 	 s 	 	of	energy	 need 	 ed 	 	for	each	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	to	get	around	in	a	city	,	now	you	can	look	at	much	 small 	 er 	 	 amount 	 s 	 	and	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
so	next	time	you	think	about	a	vehicle	,	i	hope	,	like	us	,	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
thank	you	.
