 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	when	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	or	underemployed	,	there	's	a	fair	amount	of	interest	in	what	technology	might	be	 do 	 ing 	 	to	the	labor	force	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	look	at	the	conversation	,	it	 strike 	 s 	 	me	that	it	's	focused	on	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	right	 top 	 ic 	 	,	and	at	the	same	time	,	it	's	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	point	 entire 	 ly 	 	.
the	 top 	 ic 	 	that	it	's	focused	on	,	the	question	is	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	all	these	digital	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	 affect 	 ing 	 	people	's	ability	to	earn	a	living	,	or	,	to	say	it	a	little	bit	different	way	,	are	the	droids	taking	our	 job 	 s 	 	?
and	there	's	some	evidence	that	they	are	.
the	great	 recess 	 ion 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	when	american	gdp	 resume 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	kind	of	 s 	 low 	 	,	 stead 	 y 	 	march	 up 	 ward 	 	,	and	some	other	economic	 indic 	 ators 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 bound 	 	,	and	they	got	kind	of	 health 	 y 	 	kind	of	 quick 	 ly 	 	.	corporate	 profit 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	high	.	in	fact	,	if	you	include	bank	 profit 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 high 	 er 	 	than	they	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	.
and	business	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	gear	,	in	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	and	 hard 	 ware 	 	and	 soft 	 ware 	 	is	at	an	all	-	time	high	.
so	the	 business 	 es 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	out	 the 	 ir 	 	checkbooks	.
what	they	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 hir 	 ing 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	red	line	is	the	 employ 	 ment 	 	-	to	-	population	ratio	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	age	people	in	america	who	have	work	.
and	we	see	that	it	cratered	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	great	 recess 	 ion 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 bounc 	 e 	 	back	at	all	.
but	the	story	is	not	just	a	 recess 	 ion 	 	story	.
the	decade	that	we	've	just	 be 	 en 	 	through	had	 relat 	 ively 	 	anemic	job	growth	all	 through 	 out 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	we	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	other	 decade 	 s 	 	,	and	the	2000s	are	the	 on 	 ly 	 	time	we	have	on	record	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	 few 	 er 	 	people	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	end	of	the	decade	than	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	what	you	want	to	see	.
when	you	graph	the	number	of	potential	 employ 	 ees 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	number	of	 job 	 s 	 	in	the	country	,	you	see	the	gap	 get 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	over	time	,	and	then	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	great	 recess 	 ion 	 	,	it	 open 	 ed 	 	up	in	a	huge	way	.
i	did	some	quick	 calcul 	 ations 	 	.	i	took	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	of	gdp	growth	and	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	of	labor	 product 	 ivity 	 	growth	and	used	 t 	 hose 	 	in	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	way	to	try	to	project	how	 man 	 y 	 	 job 	 s 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	was	going	to	need	to	keep	growing	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	line	that	i	came	up	with	.
is	that	good	or	bad	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	government	's	 project 	 ion 	 	for	the	 work 	 ing 	 	age	population	going	forward	.
so	if	these	 predict 	 ions 	 	are	accurate	,	that	gap	is	not	going	to	close	.
the	problem	is	,	i	do	n't	think	these	 project 	 ions 	 	are	accurate	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	i	think	my	 project 	 ion 	 	is	way	too	 optimist 	 ic 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	did	it	,	i	was	 assum 	 ing 	 	that	the	future	was	kind	of	going	to	look	like	the	past	with	labor	 product 	 ivity 	 	growth	,	and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	look	around	,	i	think	that	we	ai	n't	 s 	 een 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	yet	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	technology	's	impact	on	the	labor	force	.
just	in	the	past	couple	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	digital	 tool 	 s 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	and	abilities	that	they	never	,	ever	had	before	,	and	that	,	kind	of	,	eat	 deep 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	what	we	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	do	for	a	living	.	let	me	give	you	a	couple	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.

now	we	have	multi	-	language	,	instantaneous	,	 autom 	 atic 	 	 transl 	 ation 	 	 service 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	for	free	via	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	all	the	way	down	to	 smart 	 phone 	 s 	 	.
and	if	any	of	us	have	used	these	,	we	know	that	they	're	not	perfect	,	but	they	're	 de 	 cent 	 	.
 through 	 out 	 	all	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	written	,	a	report	or	an	article	,	you	had	to	involve	a	person	.
not	 any 	 more 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	article	that	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	forbes	 on 	 line 	 	a	while	back	about	apple	's	 earn 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
it	was	written	by	an	algorithm	.
and	it	's	not	 de 	 cent 	 	,	it	's	perfect	.
a	lot	of	people	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	they	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	but	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	,	narrow	 task 	 s 	 	,	and	most	knowledge	 work 	 ers 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 general 	 ists 	 	,	and	what	they	do	is	 s 	 it 	 	on	top	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	body	of	 expert 	 ise 	 	and	knowledge	and	they	use	that	to	react	on	the	fly	to	kind	of	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	 autom 	 ate 	 	.	``
one	of	the	most	 impress 	 ive 	 	knowledge	 work 	 ers 	 	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	is	a	guy	named	ken	jennings	.
he	won	the	quiz	show	``	 jeopard 	 y 	 	!	``	74	 time 	 s 	 	in	a	row	,	took	home	three	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
that	's	ken	on	the	right	 get 	 ting 	 	beat	three	to	one	by	watson	,	the	``	 jeopard 	 y 	 	!	``	-	 play 	 ing 	 	 super 	 computer 	 	from	ibm	.
so	when	we	look	at	what	technology	can	do	to	general	knowledge	 work 	 ers 	 	,	i	start	to	think	there	might	not	be	 some 	 thing 	 	so	special	about	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	a	 general 	 ist 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	when	we	start	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 hook 	 ing 	 	siri	up	to	watson	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	can	understand	what	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	and	repeat	speech	back	to	us	.
now	,	siri	is	far	from	perfect	,	and	we	can	make	 f 	 un 	 	of	her	 flaw 	 s 	 	,	but	we	should	 al 	 so 	 	keep	in	mind	that	if	 techno 	 logies 	 	like	siri	and	watson	improve	 a 	 long 	 	a	moore	's	law	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	,	which	they	will	,	in	six	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	going	to	be	two	 time 	 s 	 	better	or	four	 time 	 s 	 	better	,	they	'll	be	16	 time 	 s 	 	better	than	they	are	right	now	.
so	i	start	to	think	that	a	lot	of	knowledge	work	is	going	to	be	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	digital	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	not	just	 impact 	 ing 	 	knowledge	work	.
they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	flex	 the 	 ir 	 	 muscle 	 s 	 	in	the	physical	world	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	had	the	chance	a	little	while	back	to	ride	in	the	google	autonomous	car	,	which	is	 a 	 s 	 	cool	 a 	 s 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	.
and	i	will	vouch	that	it	 handle 	 d 	 	the	stop	-	and	-	go	traffic	on	u.s.	101	 ver 	 y 	 	 smooth 	 ly 	 	.
there	are	about	three	and	a	half	million	people	who	drive	 truck 	 s 	 	for	a	living	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
i	think	some	of	them	are	going	to	be	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.	and	right	now	,	 human 	 oid 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	are	still	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	primitive	.	they	ca	n't	do	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
but	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	better	 quit 	 e 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	darpa	,	which	is	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	arm	of	the	defense	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 accele 	 rate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	.
so	,	in	short	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	the	droids	are	coming	for	our	 job 	 s 	 	.
in	the	short	term	,	we	can	 stimul 	 ate 	 	job	growth	by	 encourag 	 ing 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	and	by	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 robot 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	still	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 fix 	 ing 	 	 bridge 	 s 	 	.
but	in	the	not	-	too	-	long	-	term	,	i	think	 with 	 in 	 	the	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	of	most	of	the	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	we	're	going	to	 transit 	 ion 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	productive	but	that	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	a	lot	of	human	 work 	 ers 	 	,	and	 man 	 aging 	 	that	 transit 	 ion 	 	is	going	to	be	the	 great 	 est 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
voltaire	 summarize 	 d 	 	why	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	work	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	us	from	three	great	 e 	 vil 	 s 	 	:	 bore 	 dom 	 	,	vice	and	need	.	``
but	 de 	 spite 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	i	'm	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	still	a	huge	digital	optimist	,	and	i	am	 suprem 	 e 	 ly 	 	confident	that	the	digital	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	now	are	going	to	take	us	 in 	 to 	 	a	 utopia 	 n 	 	future	,	not	a	dystopian	future	.	and	to	explain	why	,	i	want	to	pose	kind	of	a	 ridicul 	 ously 	 	broad	question	.
i	want	to	ask	what	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 develop 	 ments 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	?
now	,	i	want	to	share	some	of	the	 answer 	 s 	 	that	i	've	gotten	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	.	it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	question	to	ask	and	to	start	an	 end 	 less 	 	debate	about	,	 be 	 cause 	 	some	people	are	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	up	 system 	 s 	 	of	 philosoph 	 y 	 	in	both	the	west	and	the	east	that	have	 change 	 d 	 	how	a	lot	of	people	think	about	the	world	.
and	then	other	people	will	say	,	``	no	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	big	 st 	 ories 	 	,	the	big	 develop 	 ments 	 	are	the	 found 	 ing 	 	of	the	world	's	major	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	which	have	 change 	 d 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	have	 change 	 d 	 	and	 influence 	 d 	 	how	 count 	 less 	 	people	are	living	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.	``	and	then	some	other	folk	will	say	,	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	 change 	 s 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	what	 modifi 	 es 	 	them	and	what	 change 	 s 	 	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	are	 empire 	 s 	 	,	so	the	great	 develop 	 ments 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	are	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 con 	 quest 	 	and	of	war	.	``
and	then	some	 cheer 	 y 	 	soul	 usual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 pipe 	 s 	 	up	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	do	n't	forget	about	 plague 	 s 	 	.	``
there	are	some	 optimist 	 ic 	 	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	so	some	people	will	 br 	 ing 	 	up	the	age	of	exploration	and	the	 open 	 ing 	 	up	of	the	world	.
 other 	 s 	 	will	talk	about	intellectual	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	in	 discipline 	 s 	 	like	math	that	have	 help 	 ed 	 	us	get	a	better	handle	on	the	world	,	and	other	folk	will	talk	about	 period 	 s 	 	when	there	was	a	deep	 flourish 	 ing 	 	of	the	 art 	 s 	 	and	 science 	 s 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	debate	will	go	on	and	on	.
it	's	an	 end 	 less 	 	debate	,	and	there	's	no	conclusive	,	no	single	answer	to	it	.	but	if	you	're	a	geek	like	me	,	you	say	,	``	well	,	what	do	the	data	say	?	``
and	you	start	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	graph	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	might	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	the	total	 world 	 wide 	 	population	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	or	some	measure	of	social	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	or	the	state	of	 advance 	 ment 	 	of	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	and	you	start	to	plot	the	data	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	by	 th 	 is 	 	approach	,	the	big	 st 	 ories 	 	,	the	big	 develop 	 ments 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	will	bend	these	 curv 	 es 	 	a	lot	.
so	when	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	when	you	plot	the	data	,	you	 pre 	 tty 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	come	to	some	weird	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	.
you	conclude	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 matter 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
they	have	n't	 d 	 one 	 	a	darn	thing	to	the	 curv 	 es 	 	.
there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	one	story	,	one	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	bent	the	 curv 	 e 	 	,	bent	it	just	about	90	 degree 	 s 	 	,	and	it	is	a	technology	story	.
the	 s 	 team 	 	engine	,	and	the	other	 associate 	 d 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	of	the	industrial	revolution	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	and	 influence 	 d 	 	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	so	much	,	that	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	the	historian	ian	morris	,	they	made	mockery	out	of	all	that	had	come	before	.
and	they	did	 th 	 is 	 	by	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	the	power	of	our	 muscle 	 s 	 	,	 over 	 coming 	 	the	 limit 	 ations 	 	of	our	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
now	,	what	we	're	in	the	middle	of	now	is	 over 	 coming 	 	the	 limit 	 ations 	 	of	our	individual	 brain 	 s 	 	and	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	our	mental	power	.
how	can	 th 	 is 	 	not	be	 a 	 s 	 	big	a	deal	 a 	 s 	 	 over 	 coming 	 	the	 limit 	 ations 	 	of	our	 muscle 	 s 	 	?
so	at	the	risk	of	 repeat 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	little	bit	,	when	i	look	at	what	's	going	on	with	digital	technology	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	are	not	 any 	 where 	 	near	through	with	 th 	 is 	 	journey	,	and	when	i	look	at	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	and	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	my	single	 con 	 clusion 	 	is	that	we	ai	n't	 s 	 een 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	yet	.	the	best	 day 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 a 	 head 	 	.
let	me	give	you	a	couple	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	do	n't	run	on	energy	.	they	do	n't	run	on	capital	,	they	do	n't	run	on	labor	.	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	run	on	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	the	work	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	the	work	of	coming	up	with	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	is	some	of	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	,	some	of	the	most	fundamental	work	that	we	can	do	in	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	how	we	used	to	do	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
we	'd	find	a	bunch	of	 fair 	 ly 	 	similar	-	looking	people	--	--	we	'd	take	them	out	of	elite	 institution 	 s 	 	,	we	'd	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	other	elite	 institution 	 s 	 	,	and	we	'd	wait	for	the	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
now	--	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	white	guy	who	 s 	 pent 	 	his	whole	 care 	 er 	 	at	mit	and	harvard	,	i	got	no	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	some	other	people	do	,	and	they	've	kind	of	 crash 	 ed 	 	the	party	and	loosened	up	the	dress	code	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
so	here	are	the	 winner 	 s 	 	of	a	top	coder	 programm 	 ing 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	and	i	assure	you	that	 no 	 body 	 	 care 	 s 	 	where	these	 kid 	 s 	 	grew	up	,	where	they	went	to	school	,	or	what	they	look	like	.	all	 any 	 one 	 	 care 	 s 	 	about	is	the	quality	of	the	work	,	the	quality	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	technology	-	 facilitate 	 d 	 	world	.
the	work	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	 be 	 coming 	 	more	open	,	more	inclusive	,	more	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	and	more	merit	-	based	,	and	that	's	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	no	matter	what	mit	and	harvard	think	of	it	,	and	i	could	n't	be	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	about	that	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
i	hear	once	in	a	while	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'll	grant	you	that	,	but	technology	is	still	a	tool	for	the	rich	world	,	and	what	's	not	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	these	digital	 tool 	 s 	 	are	not	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	people	at	the	bottom	of	the	pyramid	.	``
and	i	want	to	say	to	that	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	:	 non 	 sense 	 	.
the	bottom	of	the	pyramid	is	 benefit 	 ing 	 	 huge 	 ly 	 	from	technology	.
the	economist	robert	jensen	did	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	a	while	back	where	he	 watch 	 ed 	 	,	in	great	detail	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 fish 	 ing 	 	 village 	 s 	 	of	kerala	,	india	,	when	they	got	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	,	and	when	you	write	for	the	 quarter 	 ly 	 	journal	of	 economic 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	use	 ver 	 y 	 	dry	and	 ver 	 y 	 	circumspect	language	,	but	when	i	read	his	paper	,	i	kind	of	feel	jensen	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 cream 	 	at	us	,	and	say	,	look	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	big	deal	.

and	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	both	the	 buy 	 ers 	 	and	the	sellers	in	these	 village 	 s 	 	 measur 	 ably 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	what	i	do	n't	think	is	that	jensen	got	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	and	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	land	in	the	one	set	of	 village 	 s 	 	where	technology	made	 thing 	 s 	 	better	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	is	he	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	 document 	 ed 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	when	technology	 come 	 s 	 	for	the	first	time	to	an	environment	and	a	community	.
the	 live 	 s 	 	of	people	,	the	welfares	of	people	,	improve	 dramat 	 ically 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	look	around	at	all	the	evidence	,	and	i	think	about	the	room	that	we	have	 a 	 head 	 	of	us	,	i	 be 	 come 	 	a	huge	digital	optimist	,	and	i	start	to	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	from	the	physicist	freeman	dyson	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 hyper 	 bo 	 le 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	accurate	 assess 	 ment 	 	of	what	's	going	on	.
our	digital	--	our	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	great	 gift 	 s 	 	,	and	we	,	right	now	,	have	the	great	good	fortune	to	be	living	at	a	time	when	digital	technology	is	 flourish 	 ing 	 	,	when	it	is	 broad 	 en 	 ing 	 	and	 deepen 	 ing 	 	and	 be 	 coming 	 	more	 pro 	 found 	 	all	around	the	world	.
so	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	the	droids	are	taking	our	 job 	 s 	 	,	but	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	that	fact	 mis 	 s 	 es 	 	the	point	 entire 	 ly 	 	.
the	point	is	that	then	we	are	 free 	 d 	 	up	to	do	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	what	we	are	going	to	do	,	i	am	 ver 	 y 	 	confident	,	what	we	're	going	to	do	is	 reduc 	 e 	 	poverty	and	 drudg 	 ery 	 	and	 mis 	 ery 	 	around	the	world	.	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	confident	we	're	going	to	learn	to	live	more	 light 	 ly 	 	on	the	planet	,	and	i	am	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	confident	that	what	we	're	going	to	do	with	our	new	digital	 tool 	 s 	 	is	going	to	be	so	 pro 	 found 	 	and	so	 benefici 	 al 	 	that	it	's	going	to	make	a	mockery	out	of	 every 	 thing 	 	that	came	before	.
i	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	last	word	to	a	guy	who	had	a	front	row	seat	for	digital	progress	,	our	old	friend	ken	jennings	.	i	'm	with	him	.
i	'm	going	to	echo	his	 word 	 s 	 	:	``	i	,	for	one	,	welcome	our	new	computer	overlords	.	``
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
