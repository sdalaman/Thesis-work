i	want	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	the	open	-	source	 programm 	 ing 	 	world	can	teach	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	but	before	that	,	a	little	 pre 	 am 	 ble 	 	.
let	's	start	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	martha	payne	.	martha	's	a	9	-	year	-	old	scot	who	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	council	of	argyll	and	bute	.
a	couple	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	payne	 start 	 ed 	 	a	food	blog	 call 	 ed 	 	neverseconds	,	and	she	would	take	her	camera	with	her	every	day	to	school	to	document	her	school	 lunch 	 es 	 	.
can	you	spot	the	 veget 	 able 	 	?
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	blog	 acquir 	 ed 	 	first	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 read 	 ers 	 	,	and	then	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 read 	 ers 	 	,	and	then	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 read 	 ers 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	people	tuned	in	to	watch	her	rate	her	school	 lunch 	 es 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	on	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 categor 	 y 	 	,	``	 piece 	 s 	 	of	hair	found	in	food	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	zero	day	.	that	's	good	.
and	then	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	 yester 	 day 	 	,	she	 post 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
a	post	that	read	:	``	 good 	 bye 	 	.	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	sorry	to	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	my	head	teacher	 pull 	 ed 	 	me	out	of	class	 to 	 day 	 	and	told	me	i	'm	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	take	 picture 	 s 	 	in	the	lunch	room	 any 	 more 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
thank	you	for	 read 	 ing 	 	.	 good 	 bye 	 	.	``
you	can	guess	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	next	,	right	?
the	 out 	 rage 	 	was	so	swift	,	so	 volu 	 min 	 ous 	 	,	so	unanimous	,	that	the	council	of	argyll	and	bute	 revers 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	same	day	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	would	,	we	would	never	censor	a	nine	-	year	-	old	.	``
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	up	the	question	,	what	made	them	think	they	could	get	away	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	?
and	the	answer	is	,	all	of	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	prior	to	now	.
so	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	a	medium	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 put 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	new	 idea 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 circul 	 ation 	 	?
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	just	a	contemporaneous	question	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	've	 face 	 d 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	over	the	last	few	centuries	.
when	the	 tele 	 graph 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	it	was	clear	that	it	was	going	to	globalize	the	news	industry	.
what	would	 th 	 is 	 	lead	to	?
well	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	it	would	lead	to	world	peace	.
the	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	a	medium	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	not	just	to	hear	but	see	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	see	,	what	was	going	on	 else 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	what	would	 th 	 is 	 	lead	to	?
world	peace	.
the	 tele 	 phone 	 	?
you	 guess 	 ed 	 	it	:	world	peace	.
sorry	for	the	 spoil 	 er 	 	alert	,	but	no	world	peace	.	not	yet	.
even	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	even	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	was	 assum 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	tool	that	was	going	to	enforce	catholic	intellectual	 hegemon 	 y 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	europe	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	what	we	got	was	martin	luther	's	95	 these 	 s 	 	,	the	protestant	 reform 	 ation 	 	,	and	,	you	know	,	the	thirty	 year 	 s 	 	'	war	.	all	right	,	so	what	all	of	these	 predict 	 ions 	 	of	world	peace	got	right	is	that	when	a	lot	of	new	 idea 	 s 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	come	 in 	 to 	 	 circul 	 ation 	 	,	it	 change 	 s 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
what	they	got	 exact 	 ly 	 	wrong	was	what	 happen 	 s 	 	next	.
the	more	 idea 	 s 	 	there	are	in	 circul 	 ation 	 	,	the	more	 idea 	 s 	 	there	are	for	any	individual	to	disagree	with	.
more	media	 al 	 ways 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	more	 argu 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	the	media	's	space	 expand 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	when	we	look	back	on	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	in	the	early	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	like	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
we	are	a	pro	-	 print 	 ing 	 	press	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
so	how	do	we	square	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	it	 lead 	 s 	 	to	more	 argu 	 ing 	 	,	but	we	think	it	was	good	?
and	the	answer	,	i	think	,	can	be	found	in	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	cover	of	``	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	,	``	the	first	scientific	journal	ever	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	english	in	the	middle	of	the	1600s	,	and	it	was	 create 	 d 	 	by	a	group	of	people	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	``	the	 in 	 visible 	 	college	,	``	a	group	of	natural	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	who	 on 	 ly 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	would	call	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	improve	the	way	natural	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	 argu 	 ed 	 	with	each	other	,	and	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	two	 thing 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	 need 	 ed 	 	 open 	 ness 	 	.	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	create	a	norm	which	 s 	 aid 	 	,	when	you	do	an	experiment	,	you	have	to	publish	not	just	your	 claim 	 s 	 	,	but	how	you	did	the	experiment	.
if	you	do	n't	tell	us	how	you	did	it	,	we	wo	n't	trust	you	.
but	the	other	thing	they	 need 	 ed 	 	was	speed	.
they	had	to	 quick 	 ly 	 	 synchron 	 ize 	 	what	other	natural	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	 k 	 new 	 	.	 other 	 wise 	 	,	you	could	n't	get	the	right	kind	of	argument	going	.
the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	was	 clear 	 ly 	 	the	right	medium	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	the	book	was	the	wrong	tool	.	it	was	too	 s 	 low 	 	.
and	so	they	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	scientific	journal	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 synchron 	 izing 	 	the	argument	 a 	 cross 	 	the	community	of	natural	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
the	scientific	revolution	was	n't	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	.
it	was	 create 	 d 	 	by	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	but	it	could	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	if	they	did	n't	have	a	 print 	 ing 	 	press	 a 	 s 	 	a	tool	.
so	what	about	us	?	what	about	our	generation	,	and	our	media	revolution	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	?
well	,	 predict 	 ions 	 	of	world	peace	?	check	.
more	 argu 	 ing 	 	?	gold	star	on	that	one	.
i	mean	,	youtube	is	just	a	gold	mine	.
better	 argu 	 ing 	 	?	that	's	the	question	.
so	i	 stud 	 y 	 	social	media	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	to	a	first	 ap 	 proxim 	 ation 	 	,	i	watch	people	 argu 	 e 	 	.
and	if	i	had	to	pick	a	group	that	i	think	is	our	 in 	 visible 	 	college	,	is	our	generation	's	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	people	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	these	 tool 	 s 	 	and	to	press	it	 in 	 to 	 	service	,	not	for	more	 argument 	 s 	 	,	but	for	better	 argument 	 s 	 	,	i	'd	pick	the	open	-	source	 programm 	 ers 	 	.
 programm 	 ing 	 	is	a	three	-	way	relationship	between	a	 programm 	 er 	 	,	some	source	code	,	and	the	computer	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	run	on	,	but	 computer 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 uch 	 	 famous 	 ly 	 	 in 	 flex 	 ible 	 	 interpret 	 ers 	 	of	 instruct 	 ions 	 	that	it	's	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	difficult	to	write	out	a	set	of	 instruct 	 ions 	 	that	the	computer	 know 	 s 	 	how	to	execute	,	and	that	's	if	one	person	is	writing	it	.
once	you	get	more	than	one	person	writing	it	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	for	any	two	 programm 	 ers 	 	to	overwrite	each	other	's	work	if	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	same	file	,	or	to	 s 	 end 	 	 in 	 compatible 	 	 instruct 	 ions 	 	that	 simpl 	 y 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	the	computer	to	choke	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	problem	 grow 	 s 	 	 large 	 r 	 	the	more	 programm 	 ers 	 	are	 involve 	 d 	 	.
to	a	first	 ap 	 proxim 	 ation 	 	,	the	problem	of	 man 	 aging 	 	a	large	 soft 	 ware 	 	project	is	the	problem	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	social	 cha 	 os 	 	at	 ba 	 y 	 	.
now	,	for	 decade 	 s 	 	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 can 	 on 	 ical 	 	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	which	is	to	use	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	version	control	system	,	``	and	a	version	control	system	 do 	 es 	 	what	is	 say 	 s 	 	on	the	tin	.
it	 provide 	 s 	 	a	 can 	 on 	 ical 	 	copy	of	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	on	a	 serv 	 er 	 	 some 	 where 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 programm 	 ers 	 	who	can	change	it	are	people	who	've	 specific 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	to	access	it	,	and	they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	access	the	sub	-	section	of	it	that	they	have	 per 	 mission 	 	to	change	.
and	when	people	draw	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	version	control	 system 	 s 	 	,	the	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	look	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
all	right	.	they	look	like	org	 chart 	 s 	 	.
and	you	do	n't	have	to	 s 	 quint 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	see	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 ram 	 ification 	 s 	 	of	a	system	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	feudalism	:	one	owner	,	 man 	 y 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	.
now	,	that	's	fine	for	the	commercial	 soft 	 ware 	 	industry	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 micro 	 soft 	 	's	 off 	 ice 	 	.	it	's	adobe	's	photoshop	.
the	corporation	 own 	 s 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
the	 programm 	 ers 	 	come	and	go	.
but	there	was	one	 programm 	 er 	 	who	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	the	way	to	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	linus	torvalds	.
torvalds	is	the	most	famous	open	-	source	 programm 	 er 	 	,	 create 	 d 	 	linux	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	and	torvalds	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	way	the	open	-	source	 move 	 ment 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
open	-	source	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	the	core	promise	of	the	open	-	source	 licens 	 e 	 	,	is	that	 every 	 body 	 	should	have	access	to	all	the	source	code	all	the	time	,	but	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	 create 	 s 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	threat	of	 cha 	 os 	 	you	have	to	forestall	in	order	to	get	 any 	 thing 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
so	most	open	-	source	 project 	 s 	 	just	held	 the 	 ir 	 	 nose 	 s 	 	and	 adopt 	 ed 	 	the	feudal	management	 system 	 s 	 	.
but	torvalds	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	i	'm	not	going	to	do	that	.	``
his	point	of	view	on	 th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	.
when	you	adopt	a	tool	,	you	 al 	 so 	 	adopt	the	management	 philosoph 	 y 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	that	tool	,	and	he	was	n't	going	to	adopt	 any 	 thing 	 	that	did	n't	work	the	way	the	linux	community	 work 	 ed 	 	.
and	to	give	you	a	sense	of	how	enormous	a	decision	like	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	of	the	internal	dependencies	 with 	 in 	 	linux	,	 with 	 in 	 	the	linux	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	,	which	sub	-	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	program	 re 	 ly 	 	on	which	other	sub	-	 part 	 s 	 	to	get	going	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	process	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	program	,	and	yet	,	for	 year 	 s 	 	,	torvalds	ran	 th 	 is 	 	not	with	 autom 	 ated 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	but	out	of	his	email	box	.
people	would	 liter 	 ally 	 	mail	him	 change 	 s 	 	that	they	'd	 agree 	 d 	 	on	,	and	he	would	merge	them	by	hand	.
and	then	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	after	looking	at	linux	and	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	the	community	 work 	 ed 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	think	i	know	how	to	write	a	version	control	system	for	free	people	.	``
and	he	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	git	.	``	git	is	 distribut 	 ed 	 	version	control	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	two	big	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	with	 tradition 	 al 	 	version	control	 system 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	that	it	 live 	 s 	 	up	to	the	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	promise	of	open	-	source	.	 every 	 body 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	on	a	project	 ha 	 s 	 	access	to	all	of	the	source	code	all	of	the	time	.
and	when	people	draw	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	git	 work 	 flow 	 	,	they	use	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	you	do	n't	have	to	understand	what	the	 circle 	 s 	 	and	boxes	and	 arrow 	 s 	 	mean	to	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	far	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	way	of	 work 	 ing 	 	than	is	 support 	 ed 	 	by	 ordin 	 ary 	 	version	control	 system 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	the	thing	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	 cha 	 os 	 	back	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	git	's	second	big	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 screen 	 shot 	 	from	github	,	the	 pre 	 mi 	 er 	 	git	 host 	 ing 	 	service	,	and	every	time	a	 programm 	 er 	 	uses	git	to	make	any	 import 	 ant 	 	change	at	all	,	creating	a	new	file	,	 modify 	 ing 	 	an	 exist 	 ing 	 	one	,	 mer 	 ging 	 	two	 file 	 s 	 	,	git	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	signature	.
 th 	 is 	 	long	string	of	 number 	 s 	 	and	 letter 	 s 	 	here	is	a	 un 	 ique 	 	 ident 	 ifier 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	every	single	change	,	but	 with 	 out 	 	any	central	 coordi 	 nation 	 	.
every	git	system	 generate 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	number	the	same	way	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	signature	 ti 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	and	unforgeably	to	a	 part 	 icular 	 	change	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	effect	:	a	 programm 	 er 	 	in	edinburgh	and	a	 programm 	 er 	 	in	entebbe	can	both	get	the	same	--	a	copy	of	the	same	piece	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
each	of	them	can	make	 change 	 s 	 	and	they	can	merge	them	after	the	fact	even	if	they	did	n't	know	of	each	other	's	 exist 	 ence 	 	 before 	 hand 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 co 	 operation 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 coordi 	 nation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	big	change	.
now	,	i	tell	you	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	not	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	it	's	great	that	open	-	source	 programm 	 ers 	 	now	have	a	tool	that	 support 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	way	of	 work 	 ing 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	think	that	is	great	.
i	tell	you	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	i	think	it	 mean 	 s 	 	for	the	way	 commun 	 ities 	 	come	together	.
once	git	 allow 	 ed 	 	for	 co 	 operation 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 coordi 	 nation 	 	,	you	start	to	see	 commun 	 ities 	 	form	that	are	 enormous 	 ly 	 	large	and	complex	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	of	the	ruby	community	.
it	's	an	open	-	source	 programm 	 ing 	 	language	,	and	all	of	the	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	between	the	people	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	not	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	graph	,	but	a	people	graph	,	all	of	the	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	among	the	people	 work 	 ing 	 	on	that	project	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	an	org	chart	.
 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	dis	-	org	chart	,	and	yet	,	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	community	,	but	using	these	 tool 	 s 	 	,	they	can	now	create	 some 	 thing 	 	together	.
so	there	are	two	good	 reason 	 s 	 	to	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 techni 	 que 	 	can	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	 demo 	 cracies 	 	in	general	and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	to	the	law	.
when	you	make	the	claim	,	in	fact	,	that	 some 	 thing 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	going	to	be	good	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	you	often	get	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 action 	 	.
which	is	,	are	you	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	thing	with	the	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 cat 	 s 	 	?	like	,	is	that	the	thing	you	think	is	going	to	be	good	for	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
to	which	i	have	to	say	,	here	's	the	thing	with	the	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 cat 	 s 	 	.	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	just	mean	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	i	mean	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	with	media	,	full	stop	.
it	did	not	take	long	after	the	rise	of	the	commercial	 print 	 ing 	 	press	before	 some 	 one 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	 er 	 otic 	 	 novel 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	good	idea	.
you	do	n't	have	to	have	an	economic	incentive	to	sell	 book 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	long	before	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	know	what	i	bet	people	would	pay	for	?	``
it	took	people	 an 	 other 	 	150	 year 	 s 	 	to	even	think	of	the	scientific	journal	,	right	?	so	--	so	the	 harness 	 ing 	 	by	the	 in 	 visible 	 	college	of	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	to	create	the	scientific	journal	was	 phenomen 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	it	did	n't	happen	big	,	and	it	did	n't	happen	quick	,	and	it	did	n't	happen	fast	,	so	if	you	're	going	to	look	for	where	the	change	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	you	have	to	look	on	the	 margin 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	law	is	 al 	 so 	 	 depend 	 ency 	 	-	related	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	of	the	u.s.	tax	code	,	and	the	dependencies	of	one	law	on	other	 law 	 s 	 	for	the	 over 	 all 	 	effect	.
so	there	's	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 ite 	 	for	source	code	management	.
but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	fact	that	law	is	 an 	 other 	 	place	where	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 opinion 	 s 	 	in	 circul 	 ation 	 	,	but	they	need	to	be	resolved	to	one	 can 	 on 	 ical 	 	copy	,	and	when	you	go	onto	github	,	and	you	look	around	,	there	are	 million 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	which	are	source	code	,	but	if	you	look	around	the	 edge 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	people	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 ram 	 ification 	 s 	 	of	a	system	like	that	.
 some 	 one 	 	put	up	all	the	wikileaked	 cable 	 s 	 	from	the	state	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	 soft 	 ware 	 	used	to	interpret	them	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	use	ever	of	the	cablegate	 cable 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	tool	for	 detect 	 ing 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	haiku	in	state	 depart 	 ment 	 	 pro 	 s 	 e 	 	.
right	.
the	new	york	senate	 ha 	 s 	 	put	up	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	open	 legisl 	 ation 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	 host 	 ing 	 	it	on	github	,	 aga 	 in 	 	for	all	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	of	 up 	 d 	 ating 	 	and	 fluid 	 ity 	 	.
you	can	go	and	pick	your	senator	and	then	you	can	see	a	list	of	 bill 	 s 	 	they	have	 sponsor 	 ed 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	going	by	divegeek	 ha 	 s 	 	put	up	the	utah	code	,	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	the	state	of	utah	,	and	they	've	put	it	up	there	not	just	to	 distribut 	 e 	 	the	code	,	but	with	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	used	to	further	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 legisl 	 ation 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	put	up	a	tool	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 copy 	 right 	 	debate	last	year	in	the	senate	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	it	's	strange	that	hollywood	 ha 	 s 	 	more	access	to	canadian	 legisl 	 ators 	 	than	canadian	 citizen 	 s 	 	do	.	why	do	n't	we	use	github	to	show	them	what	a	citizen	-	 develop 	 ed 	 	bill	might	look	like	?	``
and	it	 include 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 e 	 voc 	 ative 	 	 screen 	 shot 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	diff	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	thing	on	the	right	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	you	,	for	text	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	are	 edit 	 ing 	 	,	when	a	change	was	made	,	who	made	it	,	and	what	the	change	is	.
the	stuff	in	red	is	the	stuff	that	got	 delet 	 ed 	 	.
the	stuff	in	green	is	the	stuff	that	got	 add 	 ed 	 	.
 programm 	 ers 	 	take	 th 	 is 	 	 cap 	 ability 	 	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
no	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	 off 	 ers 	 	 th 	 is 	 	feature	to	 it 	 s 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	for	either	 legisl 	 ation 	 	or	for	 budget 	 s 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	with	our	consent	and	with	our	money	.
now	,	i	would	love	to	tell	you	that	the	fact	that	the	open	-	source	 programm 	 ers 	 	have	 work 	 ed 	 	out	a	 collabor 	 ative 	 	method	that	is	large	scale	,	 distribut 	 ed 	 	,	cheap	,	and	in	sync	with	the	 ideal 	 s 	 	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	i	would	love	to	tell	you	that	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	are	in	place	,	the	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	 inevit 	 able 	 	.	but	it	's	not	.
part	of	the	problem	,	of	course	,	is	just	a	lack	of	information	.
 some 	 body 	 	put	a	question	up	on	quora	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	is	it	that	lawmakers	do	n't	use	 distribut 	 ed 	 	version	control	?	``
 th 	 is 	 	,	 graphical 	 ly 	 	,	was	the	answer	.
and	that	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	part	of	the	problem	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	part	.
the	 big 	 ger 	 	problem	,	of	course	,	is	power	.
the	people	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	 particip 	 ation 	 	do	n't	have	 legisl 	 ative 	 	power	,	and	the	people	who	have	 legisl 	 ative 	 	power	are	not	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	 particip 	 ation 	 	.
they	are	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	 open 	 ness 	 	.
there	's	no	 demo 	 cracy 	 	worth	the	name	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	move	,	but	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	is	 open 	 ness 	 	in	 on 	 ly 	 	one	direction	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 give 	 n 	 	a	 dash 	 board 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	 steer 	 ing 	 	wheel	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	the	core	promise	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 make 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
so	consider	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	thing	that	got	martha	payne	's	 opinion 	 s 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	public	was	a	piece	of	technology	,	but	the	thing	that	 ke 	 pt 	 	them	there	was	 politic 	 al 	 	will	.
it	was	the	 expect 	 ation 	 	of	the	 citizen 	 s 	 	that	she	would	not	be	 censor 	 ed 	 	.
that	's	now	the	state	we	're	in	with	these	 collabor 	 ation 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
we	have	them	.	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	them	.	they	work	.
can	we	use	them	?
can	we	 app 	 ly 	 	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	here	to	 th 	 is 	 	?
t.s	.	eliot	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	one	of	the	most	 moment 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	happen	to	a	culture	is	that	they	 acquir 	 e 	 	a	new	form	of	 pro 	 s 	 e 	 	.	``
i	think	that	's	wrong	,	but	--	i	think	it	's	right	for	 argument 	 ation 	 	.	right	?
a	 moment 	 ous 	 	thing	that	can	happen	to	a	culture	is	they	can	 acquir 	 e 	 	a	new	style	of	 argu 	 ing 	 	:	trial	by	jury	,	 vot 	 ing 	 	,	peer	review	,	now	 th 	 is 	 	.	right	?
a	new	form	of	 argu 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	our	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	,	in	the	last	decade	,	in	fact	.
it	's	large	,	it	's	 distribut 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	low	-	cost	,	and	it	's	compatible	with	the	 ideal 	 s 	 	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
the	question	for	us	now	is	,	are	we	going	to	let	the	 programm 	 ers 	 	keep	it	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	?
or	are	we	going	to	try	and	take	it	and	press	it	 in 	 to 	 	service	for	 socie 	 ty 	 	at	large	?

thank	you	.	thank	you	.
