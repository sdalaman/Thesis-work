i	have	a	friend	in	portugal	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 grand 	 father 	 	built	a	vehicle	out	of	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	and	a	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	so	he	could	transport	his	family	.
he	did	it	 be 	 cause 	 	he	could	n't	afford	a	car	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	build	one	.
there	was	a	time	when	we	 under 	 stood 	 	how	 thing 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	and	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	made	,	so	we	could	build	and	repair	them	,	or	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 l 	 east 	 	make	 inform 	 ed 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	about	what	to	buy	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	these	do	-	it	-	 your 	 self 	 	 practice 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	lost	in	the	second	half	of	the	20th	century	.
but	now	,	the	maker	community	and	the	open	-	source	model	are	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	knowledge	about	how	 thing 	 s 	 	work	and	what	they	're	made	of	back	 in 	 to 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	need	to	take	them	to	the	next	level	,	to	the	 component 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	made	of	.
for	the	most	part	,	we	still	know	what	 tradition 	 al 	 	 material 	 s 	 	like	paper	and	 text 	 ile 	 s 	 	are	made	of	and	how	they	are	 produce 	 d 	 	.
but	now	we	have	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 futurist 	 ic 	 	 composite 	 s 	 	--	 plastic 	 s 	 	that	change	shape	,	 paint 	 s 	 	that	conduct	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	 pigment 	 s 	 	that	change	color	,	 fabric 	 s 	 	that	light	up	.
let	me	show	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
so	 conduct 	 ive 	 	ink	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	paint	 circuit 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	using	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 print 	 ed 	 	circuit	 board 	 s 	 	or	 wire 	 s 	 	.
in	the	case	of	 th 	 is 	 	little	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	'm	 hold 	 ing 	 	,	we	used	it	to	create	a	touch	sensor	that	 react 	 s 	 	to	my	skin	by	 turn 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	little	light	.
 conduct 	 ive 	 	ink	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	used	by	 artist 	 s 	 	,	but	 re 	 cent 	 	 develop 	 ments 	 	 indic 	 ate 	 	that	we	will	soon	be	able	to	use	it	in	laser	 print 	 ers 	 	and	 pen 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	sheet	of	 a 	 cry 	 lic 	 	 in 	 fused 	 	with	 color 	 less 	 	light	-	 d 	 if 	 fusing 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	,	while	regular	 a 	 cry 	 lic 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	diffuses	light	around	the	 edge 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	 illuminate 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	surface	when	i	turn	on	the	 light 	 s 	 	around	it	.
two	of	the	known	 application 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	material	include	 in 	 terior 	 	design	and	multi	-	touch	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	thermochromic	 pigment 	 s 	 	change	color	at	a	 give 	 n 	 	temperature	.
so	i	'm	going	to	place	 th 	 is 	 	on	a	hot	plate	that	is	set	to	a	temperature	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 high 	 er 	 	than	 ambi 	 ent 	 	and	you	can	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
so	one	of	the	principle	 application 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	material	is	,	 among 	 st 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	in	baby	 bottle 	 s 	 	,	so	it	 indic 	 ates 	 	when	the	 content 	 s 	 	are	cool	 en 	 ough 	 	to	drink	.
so	these	are	just	a	few	of	what	are	 common 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	smart	 material 	 s 	 	.
in	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	will	be	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 object 	 s 	 	and	 techno 	 logies 	 	we	use	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
we	may	not	yet	have	the	 fly 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	science	fiction	 promise 	 d 	 	us	,	but	we	can	have	 wall 	 s 	 	that	change	color	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	temperature	,	 key 	 board 	 s 	 	that	roll	up	,	and	 window 	 s 	 	that	 be 	 come 	 	 opa 	 que 	 	at	the	flick	of	a	 s 	 witch 	 	.
so	i	'm	a	social	scientist	by	training	,	so	why	am	i	here	 to 	 day 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	smart	 material 	 s 	 	?
well	first	of	all	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	a	maker	.
i	'm	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	how	 thing 	 s 	 	work	and	how	they	are	made	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	have	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 component 	 s 	 	that	make	up	our	world	,	and	right	now	,	we	do	n't	know	 en 	 ough 	 	about	these	high	-	tech	 composite 	 s 	 	our	future	will	be	made	of	.
smart	 material 	 s 	 	are	hard	to	obtain	in	small	 quant 	 ities 	 	.
there	's	 bare 	 ly 	 	any	information	 avail 	 able 	 	on	how	to	use	them	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	little	is	 s 	 aid 	 	about	how	they	are	 produce 	 d 	 	.
so	for	now	,	they	exist	 most 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	realm	of	trade	 secret 	 s 	 	and	 patent 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	and	 corporation 	 s 	 	have	access	to	.
so	a	little	over	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	kirsty	boyle	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	project	we	 call 	 ed 	 	open	 material 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	where	we	,	and	 any 	 one 	 	else	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	join	us	,	share	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	publish	information	,	 encourag 	 e 	 	 other 	 s 	 	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	they	can	,	and	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	research	 paper 	 s 	 	and	 tutor 	 ial 	 s 	 	by	other	makers	like	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	would	like	it	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	large	,	 collect 	 ively 	 	generated	 data 	 base 	 	of	do	-	it	-	 your 	 self 	 	information	on	smart	 material 	 s 	 	.
but	why	should	we	care	how	smart	 material 	 s 	 	work	and	what	they	are	made	of	?
first	of	all	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	ca	n't	shape	what	we	do	n't	understand	,	and	what	we	do	n't	understand	and	use	 end 	 s 	 	up	 sha 	 ping 	 	us	.
the	 object 	 s 	 	we	use	,	the	 clothe 	 s 	 	we	wear	,	the	 house 	 s 	 	we	live	in	,	all	have	a	 pro 	 found 	 	impact	on	our	behavior	,	health	and	quality	of	life	.
so	if	we	are	to	live	in	a	world	made	of	smart	 material 	 s 	 	,	we	should	know	and	understand	them	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	and	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 innov 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 fuel 	 ed 	 	by	 tinker 	 ers 	 	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 amateur 	 s 	 	,	not	 expert 	 s 	 	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	 inventor 	 s 	 	and	improvers	of	 thing 	 s 	 	ranging	from	mountain	 bike 	 s 	 	to	 semi 	 conductor 	 s 	 	,	personal	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	that	material	science	is	complex	and	 requir 	 es 	 	expensive	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
but	that	's	not	 al 	 ways 	 	the	case	.
two	 scientist 	 s 	 	at	university	of	illinois	 under 	 stood 	 	 th 	 is 	 	when	they	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	paper	on	a	 simpl 	 er 	 	method	for	making	 conduct 	 ive 	 	ink	.
jordan	 bunk 	 er 	 	,	who	had	had	no	experience	with	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 un 	 til 	 	then	,	read	 th 	 is 	 	paper	and	 re 	 produce 	 d 	 	the	experiment	at	his	maker	space	using	 on 	 ly 	 	off	-	the	-	shelf	 sub 	 stance 	 s 	 	and	 tool 	 s 	 	.
he	used	a	 toast 	 er 	 	oven	,	and	he	even	made	his	own	 vor 	 t 	 ex 	 	 mix 	 er 	 	,	based	on	a	 tutor 	 ial 	 	by	 an 	 other 	 	scientist	/	maker	.
jordan	then	 publish 	 ed 	 	his	 result 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	he	had	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	did	n't	work	,	so	 other 	 s 	 	could	 stud 	 y 	 	and	 re 	 produce 	 	it	.
so	jordan	's	main	form	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	was	to	take	an	experiment	 create 	 d 	 	in	a	well	-	 equi 	 pped 	 	lab	at	the	university	and	 re 	 create 	 	it	in	a	 gar 	 age 	 	in	chicago	using	 on 	 ly 	 	cheap	 material 	 s 	 	and	 tool 	 s 	 	he	made	 him 	 self 	 	.
and	now	that	he	 publish 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	 other 	 s 	 	can	pick	up	where	he	left	and	 dev 	 ise 	 	even	 simpl 	 er 	 	 process 	 es 	 	and	 improve 	 ments 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	'd	like	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	is	hannah	perner	-	wilson	's	kit	-	of	-	no	-	 part 	 s 	 	.
her	project	's	goal	is	to	 high 	 light 	 	the	 express 	 ive 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	 material 	 s 	 	while	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	the	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 skill 	 s 	 	of	the	 build 	 er 	 	.
 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	 kit 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	in	that	they	teach	us	how	 thing 	 s 	 	work	,	but	the	 constraint 	 s 	 	inherent	in	 the 	 ir 	 	design	influence	the	way	we	learn	.
so	hannah	's	approach	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	to	 form 	 ulate 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	for	creating	 un 	 usual 	 	 object 	 s 	 	that	free	us	from	pre	-	designed	 constraint 	 s 	 	by	 teach 	 ing 	 	us	about	the	 material 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	 among 	 st 	 	hannah	's	 man 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	.
[	``	paper	 speaker 	 s 	 	``	]	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	just	a	piece	of	paper	with	some	 cop 	 per 	 	tape	on	it	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	an	mp3	player	and	a	magnet	.
so	based	on	the	research	by	marcelo	coelho	from	mit	,	hannah	 create 	 d 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	paper	 speaker 	 s 	 	out	of	a	wide	range	of	 material 	 s 	 	from	simple	 cop 	 per 	 	tape	to	 conduct 	 ive 	 	fabric	and	ink	.
just	like	jordan	and	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	makers	,	hannah	 publish 	 ed 	 	her	 recipe 	 s 	 	and	 allow 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	to	copy	and	 re 	 produce 	 	them	.
but	paper	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	is	one	of	the	most	promising	 branch 	 es 	 	of	material	science	in	that	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	create	 cheap 	 er 	 	and	 flex 	 ible 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
so	hannah	's	 artisan 	 al 	 	work	,	and	the	fact	that	she	 share 	 d 	 	her	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 open 	 s 	 	the	 door 	 s 	 	to	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	new	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	are	both	 aesthetic 	 ally 	 	 appeal 	 ing 	 	and	 innov 	 ative 	 	.
so	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	makers	is	that	we	create	out	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	curiosity	,	and	we	are	not	 af 	 raid 	 	to	fail	.
we	often	tackle	 problem 	 s 	 	from	 un 	 convention 	 al 	 	 angle 	 s 	 	,	and	,	in	the	process	,	end	up	 discover 	 ing 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	or	even	better	ways	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	the	more	people	experiment	with	 material 	 s 	 	,	the	more	 research 	 ers 	 	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	share	 the 	 ir 	 	research	,	and	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	knowledge	,	the	better	 chance 	 s 	 	we	have	to	create	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	 tru 	 ly 	 	serve	us	all	.
so	i	feel	a	bit	 a 	 s 	 	ted	nelson	must	have	when	,	in	the	early	1970s	,	he	wrote	,	``	you	must	understand	 computer 	 s 	 	now	.	``
back	then	,	 computer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	these	large	mainframes	 on 	 ly 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	 car 	 ed 	 	about	,	and	no	one	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	even	 hav 	 ing 	 	one	at	home	.
so	it	's	a	little	strange	that	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	you	must	understand	smart	 material 	 s 	 	now	.	``
just	keep	in	mind	that	 acquir 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 emptive 	 	knowledge	about	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	is	the	best	way	to	ensure	that	we	have	a	say	in	the	making	of	our	future	.
thank	you	.
