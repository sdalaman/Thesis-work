let	me	tell	you	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	fantastic	month	for	 de 	 ception 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	even	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	american	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	race	.
we	have	a	high	-	profile	journalist	caught	for	 plagiar 	 ism 	 	,	a	young	 super 	 star 	 	writer	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	book	 involve 	 s 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	made	up	 quote 	 s 	 	that	they	've	 pull 	 ed 	 	it	from	the	 shelv 	 es 	 	;	a	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 expo 	 s 	 é 	 	on	fake	book	 review 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	fantastic	.
now	,	of	course	,	not	all	 de 	 ception 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	the	news	.
much	of	the	 de 	 ception 	 	is	 every 	 day 	 	.	in	fact	,	a	lot	of	research	 show 	 s 	 	that	we	all	lie	once	or	twice	a	day	,	 a 	 s 	 	dave	 suggest 	 ed 	 	.
so	it	's	about	6:30	now	,	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	most	of	us	should	have	 li 	 ed 	 	.
let	's	take	a	look	at	winnipeg	.	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	in	the	last	24	 hour 	 s 	 	--	think	back	--	have	told	a	little	fib	,	or	a	big	one	?	how	 man 	 y 	 	have	told	a	little	lie	out	there	?
all	right	,	good	.	these	are	all	the	 liar 	 s 	 	.
make	 s 	 ure 	 	you	pay	attention	to	them	.
no	,	that	 look 	 ed 	 	good	,	it	was	about	two	 third 	 s 	 	of	you	.
the	other	third	did	n't	lie	,	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 for 	 got 	 	,	or	you	're	 ly 	 ing 	 	to	me	about	your	 ly 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 dev 	 ious 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	with	a	lot	of	the	research	,	which	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	 ly 	 ing 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	pervasive	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 pervasive 	 ness 	 	,	 combine 	 d 	 	with	the	 central 	 ity 	 	to	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	a	human	,	the	fact	that	we	can	tell	the	truth	or	make	 some 	 thing 	 	up	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	people	 through 	 out 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
here	we	have	diogenes	with	his	 lan 	 ter 	 n 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	know	what	he	was	looking	for	?
a	single	honest	man	,	and	he	 di 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	one	back	in	greece	.	and	we	have	confucius	in	the	east	who	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	 since 	 r 	 ity 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	you	 walk 	 ed 	 	the	walk	or	 talk 	 ed 	 	the	talk	,	but	that	you	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	what	you	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
you	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	your	 principle 	 s 	 	.
now	my	first	professional	 en 	 counter 	 	with	 de 	 ception 	 	is	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	than	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	a	couple	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	was	a	 custom 	 s 	 	officer	for	canada	back	in	the	mid	-	'90s	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.	i	was	 defend 	 ing 	 	canada	's	 border 	 s 	 	.
you	may	think	that	's	a	weapon	right	there	.	in	fact	,	that	's	a	stamp	.	i	used	a	stamp	to	defend	canada	's	 border 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	canadian	of	me	.	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	 de 	 ception 	 	while	 do 	 ing 	 	my	duty	here	in	 custom 	 s 	 	,	one	of	which	was	that	most	of	what	i	thought	i	 k 	 new 	 	about	 de 	 ception 	 	was	wrong	,	and	i	'll	tell	you	about	some	of	that	 to 	 night 	 	.
but	even	since	just	1995	,	'96	,	the	way	we	communicate	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	.	we	email	,	we	text	,	we	skype	,	we	facebook	.	it	's	 insan 	 e 	 	.
 al 	 most 	 	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	human	communication	's	 be 	 en 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	of	course	that	's	had	an	impact	on	 de 	 ception 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	a	couple	of	new	 de 	 ception 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	and	 document 	 ing 	 	.
they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 but 	 ler 	 	,	the	sock	puppet	and	the	chinese	water	 arm 	 y 	 	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	like	a	weird	book	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	they	're	all	new	 type 	 s 	 	of	lies	.
let	's	start	with	the	butlers	.	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	one	:	``	on	my	way	.	``	 any 	 body 	 	ever	written	,	``	on	my	way	?	``
then	you	've	 al 	 so 	 	 li 	 ed 	 	.
we	're	never	on	our	way	.	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	going	on	our	way	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	:	``	sorry	i	did	n't	respond	to	you	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
my	 batt 	 ery 	 	was	dead	.	``	your	 batt 	 ery 	 	was	n't	dead	.
you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	in	a	dead	zone	.
you	just	did	n't	want	to	respond	to	that	person	that	time	.
here	's	the	last	one	:	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	,	and	you	say	,	``	sorry	,	got	work	,	got	ta	go	.	``
but	 re 	 ally 	 	,	you	're	just	 bor 	 ed 	 	.	you	want	to	talk	to	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
each	of	these	is	about	a	relationship	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	24/7	 connect 	 ed 	 	world	.	once	you	get	my	cell	phone	number	,	you	can	 liter 	 ally 	 	be	in	touch	with	me	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
and	so	these	lies	are	 be 	 ing 	 	used	by	people	to	create	a	 buff 	 er 	 	,	like	the	 but 	 ler 	 	used	to	do	,	between	us	and	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	to	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
but	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	special	.	they	use	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	using	technology	.	you	do	n't	know	where	i	am	or	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	or	who	i	'm	with	.
and	they	're	 aim 	 ed 	 	at	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
these	are	n't	just	people	 be 	 ing 	 	 jerk 	 s 	 	.	these	are	people	that	are	 say 	 ing 	 	,	look	,	i	do	n't	want	to	talk	to	you	now	,	or	i	did	n't	want	to	talk	to	you	then	,	but	i	still	care	about	you	.
our	relationship	is	still	 import 	 ant 	 	.
now	,	the	sock	puppet	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	a	 total 	 ly 	 	different	animal	.	the	sock	puppet	is	n't	about	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	,	per	 s 	 e 	 	.	it	's	about	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
let	me	give	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	,	like	,	last	week	.
here	's	r.j.	ellory	,	best	-	seller	author	in	britain	.
here	's	one	of	his	 best 	 selling 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
here	's	a	 review 	 er 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	on	amazon	.
my	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	by	nicodemus	jones	,	is	,	``	 what 	 ever 	 	else	it	might	do	,	it	will	touch	your	soul	.	``
and	of	course	,	you	might	suspect	that	nicodemus	jones	is	r.j.	ellory	.
he	wrote	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	positive	 review 	 s 	 	about	 him 	 self 	 	.	surprise	,	surprise	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	sock	puppet	stuff	is	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	new	.
walt	whitman	 al 	 so 	 	did	 th 	 is 	 	back	in	the	day	,	before	there	was	 inter 	 net 	 	technology	.	sock	puppet	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	when	we	get	to	scale	,	which	is	the	domain	of	the	chinese	water	 arm 	 y 	 	.
chinese	water	 arm 	 y 	 	 refer 	 s 	 	to	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	in	 chin 	 a 	 	that	are	paid	small	 amount 	 s 	 	of	money	to	produce	content	.	it	could	be	 review 	 s 	 	.	it	could	be	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.	the	government	 hire 	 s 	 	these	people	,	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	hire	them	,	all	over	the	place	.
in	north	america	,	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	astroturfing	,	and	astroturfing	is	 ver 	 y 	 	common	now	.	there	's	a	lot	of	 concern 	 s 	 	about	it	.
we	see	 th 	 is 	 	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	product	 review 	 s 	 	,	book	 review 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	from	 hotel 	 s 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	that	 toast 	 er 	 	is	a	good	 toast 	 er 	 	or	not	.
now	,	looking	at	these	three	 review 	 s 	 	,	or	these	three	 type 	 s 	 	of	 de 	 ception 	 	,	you	might	think	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	making	us	a	deceptive	species	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	you	think	about	the	astroturfing	,	where	we	can	see	 de 	 ception 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	up	to	scale	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	that	.
now	,	let	's	put	 a 	 side 	 	the	 on 	 line 	 	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	chatrooms	,	which	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	.
i	can	assure	you	there	's	 de 	 ception 	 	there	.
and	let	's	put	 a 	 side 	 	the	nigerian	prince	who	's	 email 	 ed 	 	you	about	 get 	 ting 	 	the	43	million	out	of	the	country	.
let	's	forget	about	that	guy	,	too	.
let	's	focus	on	the	 conversation 	 s 	 	between	our	 friend 	 s 	 	and	our	family	and	our	 co 	 work 	 ers 	 	and	our	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 conversation 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	technology	do	to	 de 	 ception 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 folk 	 s 	 	?
here	's	a	couple	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	.	one	of	the	 stud 	 ies 	 	we	do	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 di 	 ary 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	in	which	we	ask	people	to	record	all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	and	all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	lies	for	seven	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	what	we	can	do	then	is	 calcul 	 ate 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	lies	took	place	per	conversation	 with 	 in 	 	a	medium	,	and	the	 find 	 ing 	 	that	we	get	that	 surprise 	 s 	 	people	the	most	is	that	email	is	the	most	honest	of	 t 	 hose 	 	three	media	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 throw 	 s 	 	people	for	a	loop	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	,	well	,	there	's	no	 non 	 verbal 	 	 cue 	 s 	 	,	so	why	do	n't	you	lie	more	?
the	phone	,	in	contrast	,	the	most	lies	.
 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	we	see	the	phone	is	the	 de 	 vice 	 	that	people	lie	on	the	most	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 but 	 ler 	 	lie	 ambigu 	 ities 	 	i	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	about	.
 th 	 is 	 	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	what	people	expect	.
what	about	résumés	?	we	did	a	 stud 	 y 	 	in	which	we	had	people	 app 	 ly 	 	for	a	job	,	and	they	could	 app 	 ly 	 	for	a	job	either	with	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	paper	résumé	,	or	on	linkedin	,	which	is	a	social	 network 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	like	facebook	,	but	for	 professional 	 s 	 	--	 involve 	 s 	 	the	same	information	 a 	 s 	 	a	résumé	.
and	what	we	found	,	to	 man 	 y 	 	people	's	surprise	,	was	that	 t 	 hose 	 	linkedin	résumés	 we 	 re 	 	more	honest	on	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 matter 	 ed 	 	to	 employ 	 ers 	 	,	like	your	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	or	your	 skill 	 s 	 	at	your	previous	job	.
how	about	facebook	 it 	 self 	 	?
you	know	,	we	 al 	 ways 	 	think	that	 he 	 y 	 	,	there	are	these	 ideal 	 ized 	 	 version 	 s 	 	,	people	are	just	 show 	 ing 	 	the	best	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.	i	've	thought	that	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	no	way	they	can	be	that	cool	and	have	good	of	a	life	.
well	,	one	 stud 	 y 	 	tested	 th 	 is 	 	by	 exa 	 min 	 ing 	 	people	's	 personal 	 ities 	 	.
they	had	four	good	 friend 	 s 	 	of	a	person	 judg 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
then	they	had	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	 judg 	 e 	 	the	person	's	 personal 	 ity 	 	just	from	facebook	,	and	what	they	found	was	 t 	 hose 	 	 judgment 	 s 	 	of	the	 personal 	 ity 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 ident 	 ical 	 	,	 high 	 ly 	 	 correlate 	 d 	 	,	meaning	that	facebook	 profile 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	reflect	our	actual	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
all	right	,	well	,	what	about	 on 	 line 	 	 d 	 ating 	 	?
i	mean	,	that	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	deceptive	space	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	all	have	``	 friend 	 s 	 	``	that	have	used	 on 	 line 	 	 d 	 ating 	 	.
and	they	would	tell	you	about	that	guy	that	had	no	hair	when	he	came	,	or	the	woman	that	did	n't	look	at	all	like	her	photo	.
well	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	it	,	and	so	what	we	did	is	we	 br 	 ought 	 	people	,	 on 	 line 	 	daters	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	,	and	then	we	 measur 	 ed 	 	them	.	we	got	 the 	 ir 	 	height	up	against	the	wall	,	we	put	them	on	a	scale	,	got	 the 	 ir 	 	weight	--	 lad 	 ies 	 	 love 	 d 	 	that	--	and	then	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	 the 	 ir 	 	driver	's	 licens 	 e 	 	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	age	.
and	what	we	found	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	men	and	the	height	.
 a 	 long 	 	the	bottom	is	how	tall	they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	profile	.
 a 	 long 	 	the	y	-	axis	,	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	axis	,	is	how	tall	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
that	diagonal	line	is	the	truth	line	.	if	 the 	 ir 	 	dot	's	on	it	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	truth	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	,	most	of	the	little	 dot 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 low 	 	the	line	.
what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	is	all	the	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ly 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	height	.
in	fact	,	they	 li 	 ed 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	height	about	nine	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	an	inch	,	what	we	say	in	the	lab	 a 	 s 	 	``	strong	 round 	 ing 	 	up	.	``
you	get	to	5'8	``	and	one	tenth	,	and	boom	!	5'9	``	.
but	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	here	is	,	look	at	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 dot 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 cluster 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	close	to	the	truth	.	what	we	found	was	80	percent	of	our	 particip 	 ants 	 	did	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	lie	on	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	but	they	 al 	 ways 	 	 li 	 ed 	 	by	a	little	bit	.
one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	.	if	you	go	to	a	date	,	a	coffee	date	,	and	you	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	than	what	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	game	over	.	right	?	so	people	 li 	 ed 	 	 frequent 	 ly 	 	,	but	they	 li 	 ed 	 	 sub 	 t 	 ly 	 	,	not	too	much	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	.
well	,	what	 explain 	 s 	 	all	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	?	what	 explain 	 s 	 	the	fact	that	 de 	 spite 	 	our	 intuit 	 ions 	 	,	mine	 include 	 d 	 	,	a	lot	of	 on 	 line 	 	communication	,	 techno 	 logically 	 	-	 mediate 	 d 	 	communication	,	is	more	honest	than	face	to	face	?
that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	strange	.	how	do	we	explain	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	to	do	that	,	one	thing	is	we	can	look	at	the	 de 	 ception 	 	-	 detect 	 ion 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	 liter 	 ature 	 	by	now	,	it	's	coming	up	on	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 review 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 trial 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	and	there	's	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	,	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	at	 detect 	 ing 	 	 de 	 ception 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	.	fifty	-	four	percent	 accu 	 racy 	 	on	average	when	you	have	to	tell	if	 some 	 body 	 	that	just	 s 	 aid 	 	a	 state 	 ment 	 	is	 ly 	 ing 	 	or	not	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	.	why	is	it	so	bad	?
well	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	pinocchio	's	nose	.
if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	ask	you	 guy 	 s 	 	,	what	do	you	 re 	 ly 	 	on	when	you	're	looking	at	 some 	 body 	 	and	you	want	to	find	out	if	they	're	 ly 	 ing 	 	?	what	cue	do	you	pay	attention	to	?
most	of	you	would	say	that	one	of	the	 cue 	 s 	 	you	look	at	is	the	 eye 	 s 	 	.	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	the	window	to	the	soul	.
and	you	're	not	 al 	 one 	 	.	around	the	world	,	 al 	 most 	 	every	culture	,	one	of	the	top	 cue 	 s 	 	is	 eye 	 s 	 	.	but	the	research	over	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	 say 	 s 	 	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	no	 reli 	 able 	 	cue	to	 de 	 ception 	 	,	which	 ble 	 w 	 	me	away	,	and	it	's	one	of	the	hard	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	 custom 	 s 	 	officer	.
the	 eye 	 s 	 	do	not	tell	us	 whet 	 her 	 	 some 	 body 	 	's	 ly 	 ing 	 	or	not	.
some	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	--	high	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 pupil 	 s 	 	dilate	,	 the 	 ir 	 	pitch	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	 the 	 ir 	 	body	 move 	 ments 	 	change	a	little	bit	,	but	not	all	the	time	,	not	for	 every 	 body 	 	,	it	's	not	 reli 	 able 	 	.
strange	.	the	other	thing	is	that	just	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	see	me	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	i	'm	going	to	lie	.	it	's	common	sense	,	but	one	 import 	 ant 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	lie	for	a	reason	.
we	lie	to	protect	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	or	for	our	own	gain	or	for	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	gain	.
so	there	are	some	 patho 	 logical 	 	 liar 	 s 	 	,	but	they	make	up	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	of	the	population	.	we	lie	for	a	reason	.
just	 be 	 cause 	 	people	ca	n't	see	us	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	we	're	going	to	 necess 	 arily 	 	lie	.
but	i	think	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	much	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	fundamental	going	on	here	.	the	next	big	thing	for	me	,	the	next	big	idea	,	we	can	find	by	going	way	back	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	to	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	language	.
most	 linguist 	 s 	 	agree	that	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	 some 	 where 	 	between	50,000	and	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	that	's	a	long	time	ago	.
a	lot	of	 human 	 s 	 	have	lived	since	then	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	i	guess	,	about	 fire 	 s 	 	and	 cave 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ab 	 er 	 	-	 tooth 	 ed 	 	 tiger 	 s 	 	.	i	do	n't	know	what	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	and	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	's	a	lot	of	 human 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	about	100	billion	people	in	fact	.
what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	is	that	writing	 on 	 ly 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	about	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	so	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	all	the	people	before	there	was	any	writing	,	every	word	that	they	ever	 s 	 aid 	 	,	every	 utter 	 ance 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.	no	trace	.	evanescent	.	gone	.
so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	to	talk	in	a	way	in	which	there	is	no	record	.	in	fact	,	even	the	next	big	change	to	writing	was	 on 	 ly 	 	500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	now	,	with	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	in	our	past	,	and	 liter 	 acy 	 	rates	 remain 	 ed 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	low	right	up	 un 	 til 	 	world	war	ii	,	so	even	the	people	of	the	last	two	millennia	,	most	of	the	 word 	 s 	 	they	ever	 s 	 aid 	 	--	poof	!	--	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
let	's	turn	to	now	,	the	 network 	 ed 	 	age	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 record 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?
 any 	 body 	 	do	any	writing	 to 	 day 	 	?	did	 any 	 body 	 	write	a	word	?
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 al 	 most 	 	every	single	person	here	 record 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	right	now	,	we	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	more	than	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	human	pre	-	ancient	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
that	is	crazy	.	we	're	 enter 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	period	of	flux	in	human	evolution	where	we	've	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	speak	in	a	way	in	which	our	 word 	 s 	 	disappear	,	but	we	're	in	an	environment	where	we	're	 record 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	think	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	near	future	,	it	's	not	just	what	we	write	that	will	be	 record 	 ed 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	we	do	will	be	 record 	 ed 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?	what	's	the	next	big	idea	from	that	?
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	social	scientist	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	i	have	ever	even	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	.	now	,	i	can	look	at	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	that	used	to	,	for	millennia	,	disappear	.
i	can	look	at	lies	that	before	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	and	then	gone	.
you	remember	 t 	 hose 	 	astroturfing	 review 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	before	?	well	,	when	they	write	a	fake	review	,	they	have	to	post	it	 some 	 where 	 	,	and	it	's	left	 be 	 hind 	 	for	us	.
so	one	thing	that	we	did	,	and	i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	looking	at	the	language	,	is	we	paid	people	to	write	some	fake	 review 	 s 	 	.	one	of	these	 review 	 s 	 	is	fake	.
the	person	never	was	at	the	james	hotel	.
the	other	review	is	real	.	the	person	 stay 	 ed 	 	there	.
now	,	your	task	now	is	to	decide	which	review	is	fake	?
i	'll	give	you	a	moment	to	read	through	them	.
but	i	want	 every 	 body 	 	to	raise	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	at	some	point	.
remember	,	i	 stud 	 y 	 	 de 	 ception 	 	.	i	can	tell	if	you	do	n't	raise	your	hand	.
all	right	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	a	is	the	fake	?
all	right	.	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.	about	half	.
and	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	think	that	b	is	?
all	right	.	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	for	b	.
 excel 	 lent 	 	.	here	's	the	answer	.
b	is	a	fake	.	well	 d 	 one 	 	second	group	.	you	 dominate 	 d 	 	the	first	group	.
you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	little	bit	 un 	 usual 	 	.	every	time	we	 demonst 	 rate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	about	a	50-50	split	,	which	 fit 	 s 	 	with	the	research	,	54	percent	.	 may 	 be 	 	people	here	in	winnipeg	are	more	suspicious	and	better	at	 figur 	 ing 	 	it	out	.
 t 	 hose 	 	cold	,	hard	 winter 	 s 	 	,	i	love	it	.
all	right	,	so	why	do	i	care	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	what	i	can	do	now	with	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	computer	science	is	we	can	create	computer	 algorithm 	 s 	 	that	can	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	 linguist 	 ic 	 	 trace 	 s 	 	of	 de 	 ception 	 	.
let	me	 high 	 light 	 	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	here	in	the	fake	review	.	the	first	is	that	 liar 	 s 	 	tend	to	think	about	narrative	.	they	make	up	a	story	:	who	?	and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	and	that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	.
our	fake	 review 	 ers 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	who	they	 we 	 re 	 	with	and	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.	they	 al 	 so 	 	used	the	first	person	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 	,	i	,	way	more	than	the	people	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	there	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 insert 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	hotel	review	,	kind	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	they	 we 	 re 	 	there	.
in	contrast	,	the	people	that	wrote	the	 review 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	,	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 actual 	 ly 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	physical	space	,	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	lot	more	about	spatial	information	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	how	big	the	 bath 	 room 	 	was	,	or	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	here	's	how	far	 shop 	 ping 	 	is	from	the	hotel	.
now	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	did	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	.	most	people	perform	at	chance	at	 th 	 is 	 	task	.
our	computer	algorithm	is	 ver 	 y 	 	accurate	,	much	more	accurate	than	 human 	 s 	 	can	be	,	and	it	's	not	going	to	be	accurate	all	the	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	a	 de 	 ception 	 	-	 detect 	 ion 	 	machine	to	tell	if	your	girlfriend	's	 ly 	 ing 	 	to	you	on	text	 mess 	 aging 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	every	lie	now	,	every	type	of	lie	--	fake	hotel	 review 	 s 	 	,	fake	shoe	 review 	 s 	 	,	your	girlfriend	 cheat 	 ing 	 	on	you	with	text	 mess 	 aging 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	different	lies	.	they	're	going	to	have	different	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	language	.	but	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	's	 record 	 ed 	 	now	,	we	can	look	at	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	lies	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	social	scientist	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
it	's	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	.	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	learn	so	much	more	about	human	thought	and	 express 	 ion 	 	,	about	 every 	 thing 	 	from	love	to	 attitude 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	now	,	but	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	for	the	average	citizen	?
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	for	us	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	?
well	,	let	's	forget	 de 	 ception 	 	for	a	bit	.	one	of	the	big	 idea 	 s 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	is	that	we	're	 leav 	 ing 	 	these	huge	 trace 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	.
my	outbox	for	email	is	massive	,	and	i	never	look	at	it	.	i	write	all	the	time	,	but	i	never	look	at	my	record	,	at	my	trace	.
and	i	think	we	're	going	to	see	a	lot	more	of	that	,	where	we	can	reflect	on	who	we	are	by	looking	at	what	we	wrote	,	what	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	we	did	.
now	,	if	we	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	to	 de 	 ception 	 	,	there	's	a	couple	of	take	-	away	 thing 	 s 	 	here	.
first	,	 ly 	 ing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	right	?
not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	you	 leav 	 ing 	 	a	record	for	 your 	 self 	 	on	your	machine	,	but	you	're	 leav 	 ing 	 	a	record	on	the	person	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 ly 	 ing 	 	to	,	and	you	're	 al 	 so 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	them	around	for	me	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	with	some	computer	 algorithm 	 s 	 	.
so	by	all	 mean 	 s 	 	,	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	do	that	,	that	's	good	.
but	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 ly 	 ing 	 	and	what	we	want	to	do	with	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	i	think	we	can	go	back	to	diogenes	and	confucius	.	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	less	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	to	lie	or	not	to	lie	,	and	more	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	true	to	the	self	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
now	,	when	you	are	about	to	say	or	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	we	can	think	,	do	i	want	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	part	of	my	 leg 	 acy 	 	,	part	of	my	personal	record	?
 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	digital	age	we	live	in	now	,	in	the	 network 	 ed 	 	age	,	we	are	all	 leav 	 ing 	 	a	record	.
thank	you	so	much	for	your	time	,	and	good	luck	with	your	record	.
