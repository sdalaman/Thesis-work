when	i	was	nine	,	i	saw	the	movie	``	 jaw 	 s 	 	,	``	and	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	no	,	thank	you	.	``

 poet 	 ry 	 	.
like	a	 boom 	 er 	 ang 	 	,	the	thing	i	 love 	 d 	 	came	back	to	me	.
one	of	the	first	lines	of	 poet 	 ry 	 	i	can	remember	writing	was	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	a	world	that	 demand 	 ed 	 	i	hate	 my 	 self 	 	.

when	i	was	a	kid	,	i	 trade 	 d 	 	in	 home 	 work 	 	 assign 	 ments 	 	for	 friend 	 ship 	 	,	then	 g 	 ave 	 	each	friend	a	late	slip	for	never	 show 	 ing 	 	up	on	time	,	and	in	most	 case 	 s 	 	not	at	all	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	hall	pass	to	get	through	each	broken	promise	.

when	i	was	a	kid	,	i	used	to	think	that	pork	 chop 	 s 	 	and	 kar 	 ate 	 	 chop 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	same	thing	.
i	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	both	pork	 chop 	 s 	 	.

one	day	,	before	i	 real 	 ized 	 	fat	 kid 	 s 	 	are	not	designed	to	climb	 tree 	 s 	 	,	i	fell	out	of	a	tree	and	 bruis 	 ed 	 	the	right	side	of	my	body	.
i	did	n't	want	to	tell	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	about	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	i	'd	get	in	trouble	for	 play 	 ing 	 	 some 	 where 	 	i	should	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	gym	teacher	 notice 	 d 	 	the	bruise	,	and	i	got	 s 	 ent 	 	to	the	principal	's	 off 	 ice 	 	.

i	saw	no	reason	to	lie	.
 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 concern 	 ed 	 	,	life	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
i	told	her	,	 when 	 ever 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ad 	 	,	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	 give 	 s 	 	me	 kar 	 ate 	 	 chop 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	led	to	a	full	-	scale	investigation	,	and	i	was	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	house	for	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	they	 final 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	ask	how	i	got	the	 bruis 	 es 	 	.
