sydney	.	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	my	whole	life	to	get	to	sydney	.
i	got	to	the	 air 	 port 	 	,	to	the	hotel	,	 check 	 ed 	 	in	,	and	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	in	the	lobby	,	was	a	brochure	for	the	sydney	 fest 	 ival 	 	.	i	thumbed	through	it	,	and	i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	a	show	 call 	 ed 	 	``	minto	:	live	.	``
the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	read	:	``	the	 sub 	 urban 	 	 street 	 s 	 	of	minto	 be 	 come 	 	the	stage	for	 performance 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	 inter 	 national 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	in	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	the	people	of	minto	.	``
what	was	 th 	 is 	 	place	 call 	 ed 	 	minto	?
sydney	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	would	learn	,	is	a	city	of	 suburb 	 s 	 	,	and	minto	lies	 south 	 west 	 	,	about	an	hour	away	.
i	have	to	say	,	it	was	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	had	in	mind	for	my	first	day	down	under	.
i	mean	,	i	'd	thought	about	the	harbour	bridge	or	bondi	beach	,	but	minto	?	but	still	,	i	'm	a	 produce 	 r 	 	,	and	the	lure	of	a	 s 	 ite 	 	-	specific	theater	project	was	more	than	i	could	resist	.
so	,	off	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	friday	afternoon	traffic	,	and	i	'll	never	forget	what	i	saw	when	i	got	there	.
for	the	performance	,	the	audience	 walk 	 ed 	 	around	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	from	house	to	house	,	and	the	 resident 	 s 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	the	 perform 	 ers 	 	,	they	came	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 house 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 perform 	 ed 	 	these	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	 dance 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 lawn 	 s 	 	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	driveways	.
the	show	is	a	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	a	u.k.	-	based	performance	company	 call 	 ed 	 	lone	 t 	 win 	 	.
lone	 t 	 win 	 	had	come	to	minto	and	 work 	 ed 	 	with	the	 resident 	 s 	 	,	and	they	had	 create 	 d 	 	these	 dance 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	australian	-	indian	girl	,	she	came	out	and	 start 	 ed 	 	to	dance	on	her	front	lawn	,	and	her	father	 peer 	 ed 	 	out	the	window	to	see	what	all	the	noise	and	 com 	 motion 	 	was	about	,	and	he	soon	 join 	 ed 	 	her	.
and	he	was	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	her	little	sister	.
and	soon	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 danc 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 joy 	 ous 	 	,	 ex 	 uber 	 ant 	 	dance	right	there	on	 the 	 ir 	 	lawn	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	through	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	i	was	 amaz 	 ed 	 	and	i	was	 move 	 d 	 	by	the	 in 	 credible 	 	sense	of	 owner 	 ship 	 	 th 	 is 	 	community	 clear 	 ly 	 	felt	about	 th 	 is 	 	event	.
``	minto	:	live	``	 br 	 ought 	 	sydneysiders	 in 	 to 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	with	 inter 	 national 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 celebr 	 ated 	 	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	sydney	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	 term 	 s 	 	.
the	sydney	 fest 	 ival 	 	which	 produce 	 d 	 	``	minto	:	live	``	i	think	 represent 	 s 	 	a	new	kind	of	21st	-	century	 art 	 s 	 	 fest 	 ival 	 	.
these	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	are	 radical 	 ly 	 	open	.
they	can	transform	cities	and	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	think	it	kind	of	 make 	 s 	 	sense	to	look	where	we	've	come	from	.
modern	 art 	 s 	 	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	born	in	the	 rub 	 ble 	 	of	world	war	ii	.

in	1947	,	the	edinburgh	 fest 	 ival 	 	was	born	and	avignon	was	born	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	would	follow	in	 the 	 ir 	 	wake	.
the	work	they	did	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	high	art	,	and	 star 	 s 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	like	laurie	anderson	and	merce	cunningham	and	robert	lepage	who	made	work	for	 th 	 is 	 	circuit	,	and	you	had	these	 semi 	 nal 	 	 show 	 s 	 	like	``	the	mahabharata	``	and	the	 monument 	 al 	 	``	einstein	on	the	beach	.	``
but	 a 	 s 	 	the	 decade 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	,	these	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	 establish 	 ment 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	culture	and	capital	 accele 	 rated 	 	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	us	all	together	,	high	and	low	kind	of	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	a	new	kind	of	 fest 	 ival 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
the	old	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	,	they	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	 thriv 	 e 	 	,	but	from	brighton	to	rio	to	perth	,	 some 	 thing 	 	new	was	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	,	and	these	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	different	.
they	're	open	,	these	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	like	in	minto	,	they	understand	that	the	 dial 	 ogue 	 	between	the	local	and	the	global	is	essential	.
they	're	open	 be 	 cause 	 	they	ask	the	audience	to	be	a	player	,	a	protagonist	,	a	partner	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	 pass 	 ive 	 	 spect 	 ator 	 	,	and	they	're	open	 be 	 cause 	 	they	know	that	 imagin 	 ation 	 	can	not	be	 contain 	 ed 	 	in	 building 	 s 	 	,	and	so	much	of	the	work	they	do	is	 s 	 ite 	 	-	specific	or	 out 	 door 	 	work	.
so	,	the	new	 fest 	 ival 	 	,	it	 ask 	 s 	 	the	audience	to	play	an	essential	role	in	 sha 	 ping 	 	the	performance	.
 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	de	la	guarda	,	which	i	produce	,	and	punchdrunk	create	these	 complete 	 ly 	 	 immers 	 ive 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	that	put	the	audience	at	the	center	of	the	action	,	but	the	german	performance	company	rimini	protokoll	 take 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	to	a	whole	new	level	.
in	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 show 	 s 	 	that	 include 	 s 	 	``	100	percent	vancouver	,	``	``	100	percent	berlin	,	``	rimini	protokoll	 make 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	reflect	 socie 	 ty 	 	.

lift	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	pioneer	in	the	use	of	 venue 	 s 	 	.
they	understand	that	theater	and	performance	can	happen	 any 	 where 	 	.
you	can	do	a	show	in	a	schoolroom	,	in	an	 air 	 port 	 	,	--	--	in	a	 depart 	 ment 	 	store	window	.
 artist 	 s 	 	are	 explore 	 rs 	 	.	who	better	to	show	us	the	city	 a 	 new 	 	?
 artist 	 s 	 	can	take	us	to	a	far	-	 f 	 lung 	 	part	of	the	city	that	we	have	n't	 explore 	 d 	 	,	or	they	can	take	us	 in 	 to 	 	that	building	that	we	pass	every	day	but	we	never	went	 in 	 to 	 	.
an	artist	,	i	think	,	can	 re 	 ally 	 	show	us	people	that	we	might	overlook	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
back	to	back	is	an	australian	company	of	people	with	intellectual	 dis 	 abilities 	 	.	i	saw	 the 	 ir 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	show	in	new	york	at	the	staten	 is 	 land 	 	 ferr 	 y 	 	terminal	at	rush	hour	.
we	,	the	audience	,	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	 head 	 set 	 s 	 	and	 seat 	 ed 	 	on	one	side	of	the	terminal	.
the	 act 	 ors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	right	there	in	front	of	us	,	right	there	among	the	 commute 	 rs 	 	,	and	we	could	hear	them	,	but	we	might	not	have	 other 	 wise 	 	 s 	 een 	 	them	.
so	back	to	back	 take 	 s 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	-	specific	theater	and	uses	it	to	 gent 	 ly 	 	 re 	 mind 	 	us	about	who	and	what	we	 choos 	 e 	 	to	edit	out	of	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	 dial 	 ogue 	 	with	the	local	and	the	global	,	the	audience	 a 	 s 	 	 particip 	 ant 	 	and	player	and	protagonist	,	the	 innov 	 ative 	 	use	of	 s 	 ite 	 	,	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	come	to	play	in	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	work	of	the	fantastic	french	company	royal	de	luxe	.
royal	de	luxe	's	giant	 puppet 	 s 	 	come	 in 	 to 	 	a	city	and	they	live	there	for	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	.
for	``	the	sultan	's	elephant	,	``	royal	de	luxe	came	to	central	london	and	 br 	 ought 	 	it	to	a	 stand 	 still 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	story	of	a	giant	little	girl	and	her	friend	,	a	time	-	 travel 	 ing 	 	elephant	.
for	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	they	 transform 	 ed 	 	a	massive	city	 in 	 to 	 	a	community	where	 end 	 less 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	 reign 	 ed 	 	.
the	 guard 	 ian 	 	wrote	,	``	if	art	is	about	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	then	there	can	be	no	more	 transform 	 ative 	 	experience	.
what	'	the	sultan	's	elephant	'	 represent 	 s 	 	is	no	less	than	an	 art 	 istic 	 	occupation	of	the	city	and	a	 re 	 clam 	 ation 	 	of	the	 street 	 s 	 	for	the	people	.	``
we	can	talk	about	the	economic	 impact 	 s 	 	of	these	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	cities	,	but	i	'm	much	[	more	]	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	more	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	how	a	 fest 	 ival 	 	 help 	 s 	 	a	city	to	express	 it 	 self 	 	,	how	it	lets	it	come	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	.
 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	promote	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	they	 br 	 ing 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	,	they	 in 	 crease 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	they	 off 	 er 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	civic	 pri 	 de 	 	,	they	improve	our	general	 psycho 	 logical 	 	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
in	short	,	they	make	cities	better	 place 	 s 	 	to	live	.
case	in	point	:	when	``	the	sultan	's	elephant	``	came	to	london	just	nine	 month 	 s 	 	after	7/7	,	a	londoner	wrote	,	``	for	the	first	time	since	the	london	 bomb 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	my	daughter	 call 	 ed 	 	up	with	that	 spark 	 le 	 	back	in	her	voice	.
she	had	 gather 	 ed 	 	with	 other 	 s 	 	to	watch	'	the	sultan	's	elephant	,	'	and	,	you	know	,	it	just	made	all	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.	``
lyn	gardner	in	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	written	that	a	great	 fest 	 ival 	 	can	show	us	a	map	of	the	world	,	a	map	of	the	city	and	a	map	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	but	there	is	no	one	 fix 	 ed 	 	 fest 	 ival 	 	model	.
i	think	what	's	so	 brilli 	 ant 	 	about	the	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	,	the	new	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	,	is	that	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	fully	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	the	 excit 	 ement 	 	of	the	way	we	all	live	 to 	 day 	 	.
