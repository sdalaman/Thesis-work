across europe and central asia , approximately one million children live in large residential institutions , usually known as orphanages .
most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children .
others know more about the living conditions there , but still think they 're a necessary evil .
after all , where else would we put all of those children who do n't have any parents ?
but 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development , and this is particularly true for young babies .
as we know , babies are born without their full muscle development , and that includes the brain .
during the first three years of life , the brain grows to its full size , with most of that growth taking place in the first six months . the brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation .
every time a young baby learns something new -- to focus its eyes , to mimic a movement or a facial expression , to pick something up , to form a word or to sit up -- new synaptic connections are being built in the brain .
new parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning .
they are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children 's cleverness .
they communicate their delight to their children , who respond with smiles , and a desire to achieve more and to learn more .
this forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical , social , language , cognitive and psychomotor development .
it is the model for all future relationships with friends , with partners and with their own children .
it happens so naturally in most families that we do n't even notice it . most of us are unaware of its importance to human development and , by extension , to the development of a healthy society .
and it 's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children .
in august , 1993 , i had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting .
those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of romania after the 1989 revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions .
i was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families .
housing 550 babies , this was ceausescu 's show orphanage , and so i 'd been told the conditions were much better .
having worked with lots of young children , i expected the institution to be a riot of noise , but it was as silent as a convent .
it was hard to believe there were any children there at all , yet the director showed me into room after room , each containing row upon row of cots , in each of which lay a child staring into space .
in a room of 40 newborns , not one of them was crying .
yet i could see soiled nappies , and i could see that some of the children were distressed , but the only noise was a low , continuous moan .
the head nurse told me proudly , " you see , our children are very well - behaved . "
over the next few days , i began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional .
the newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours , but their demands were not met , and so eventually they learned not to bother . within a few days , they were listless , lethargic , and staring into space like all the others .
over the years , many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children , but often , one member of staff is caring for 10 , 20 , and even 40 children .
hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program .
the children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30 .
at 8 , their nappies must be changed , so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children .
if a child soils its nappy at 8:30 , he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again .
the child 's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing , and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling , the walls or the bars of their cots .
since my first visit to ceausescu 's institution , i 've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries , from the czech republic to sudan .
across all of these diverse lands and cultures , the institutions , and the child 's journey through them , is depressingly similar .
lack of stimulation often leads to self - stimulating behaviors like hand - flapping , rocking back and forth , or aggression , and in some institutions , psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children , whilst in others , children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others .
these children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities .
most of these children will never leave the institution again .
for those without disabilities , at age three , they 're transferred to another institution , and at age seven , to yet another . segregated according to age and gender , they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings , often without even a chance to say goodbye .
there 's rarely enough to eat . they are often hungry .
the older children bully the little ones . they learn to survive . they learn to defend themselves , or they go under .
when they leave the institution , they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society .
in moldova , young women raised in institutions are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers , and a russian study found that two years after leaving institutions , young adults , 20 percent of them had a criminal record , 14 percent were involved in prostitution , and 10 percent had taken their own lives .
but why are there so many orphans in europe when there has n't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years ?
in fact , more than 95 percent of these children have living parents , and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children , but research shows that most parents want their children , and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty , disability and ethnicity .
many countries have not developed inclusive schools , and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school , at age six or seven .
the institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home .
if the family 's poor , they find it difficult to visit , and gradually the relationship breaks down .
behind each of the million children in institutions , there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they 've run out of options , like natalia in moldova , who only had enough money to feed her baby , and so had to send her older son to the institution ; or desi , in bulgaria , who looked after her four children at home until her husband died , but then she had to go out to work full time , and with no support , felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution ; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they 're pregnant , who leave their babies in a hospital ; or the new parents , the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability , and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child 's potential , are told by the doctors , " forget her , leave her in the institution , go home and make a healthy one . "
this state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable .
every child has the right to a family , deserves and needs a family , and children are amazingly resilient .
we find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on , they recover their developmental delays , and go on to lead normal , happy lives .
it 's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions .
one study suggests that a family support service costs 10 percent of an institutional placement , whilst good quality foster care costs usually about 30 percent .
if we spend less on these children but on the right services , we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs .
across europe , a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community - based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential . when i first started to work in romania nearly 20 years ago , there were 200,000 children living in institutions , and more entering every day .
now , there are less than 10,000 , and family support services are provided across the country .
in moldova , despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis , the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than 50 percent in the last five years , and the resources are being redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools .
many countries have developed national action plans for change .
the european commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support , empowering communities to look after their own children .
but there is still much to be done to end the systematic institutionalization of children .
awareness - raising is required at every level of society .
people need to know the harm that institutions cause to children , and the better alternatives that exist .
if we know people who are planning to support orphanages , we should convince them to support family services instead .
together , this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime .
thank you .
