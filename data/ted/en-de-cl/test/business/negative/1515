so would n't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do , as we 're walking around being able to point a phone at anything , and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human brain , and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas .
well , traditionally that was seen as science fiction , but now we 've moved to a world where actually this has become possible .
so the best way of explaining it is to just show it .
what you can see over here is tamara , who is holding my phone that 's now plugged in .
so let me start with this .
what we have here is a painting of the great poet rabbie burns , and it 's just a normal image , but if we now switch inputs over to the phone , running our technology , you can see effectively what tamara 's seeing on the screen , and when she points at this image , something magical happens .
voice : now simmer blinks on flowery braes ...
matt mills : now , what 's great about this is , there 's no trickery here .
there 's nothing done to this image .
and what 's great about this is the technology 's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does .
not only that , but as i move the object around , it 's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly .
again , the thing that 's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become .
all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself .
now , this has applications everywhere , whether in things like art in museums , like you just saw , or in the world of , say , advertising , or print journalism .
so a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it 's printed .
and here is this morning 's newspaper , and we have some wimbledon news , which is great .
now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin .
voice : ... to the grass , and it 's very important that you adapt and you , you have to be flexible , you have to be willing to change direction at a split second , and she does all that . she 's won this title .
mm : and that linking of the digital content to something that 's physical is what we call an aura , and i 'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk .
so , what 's great about this is it is n't just a faster , more convenient way to get information in the real world , but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible .
so what i have here is a wireless router .
my american colleagues have told me i 've got to call it a router , so that everyone here understands -- -- but nonetheless , here is the device .
so now what i can do is , rather than getting the instructions for the device online , i can simply point at it , the device is recognized , and then -- voice : begin by plugging in the grey adsl cable .
then connect the power . finally , the yellow ethernet cable .
congratulations . you have now completed setup .
mm : awesome . thank you .
the incredible work that made that possible was done here in the u.k. by scientists at cambridge , and they work in our offices , and i 've got a lovely picture of them here .
they could n't all be on stage , but we 're going to bring their aura to the stage , so here they are .
they 're not very animated .
this was the fourth take , i 'm told .
okay . so , as we 're talking about cambridge , let 's now move on to technical advancements , because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago , the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate , and that means that i can now take cinema - quality 3d models and place them in the world around me , so i have one over here .
tamara , would you like to jump in ?
mm : i should leap in .
so then , after the fun , comes the more emotional side of what we do , because effectively , this technology allows you to see the world through someone 's eyes , and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world .
what 's great about this is , the tools to do this are free .
they 're open , they 're available to everyone within our application , and educators have really got on board with the classrooms .
so we have teachers who 've tagged up textbooks , teachers who 've tagged up school classrooms , and a great example of this is a school in the u.k.
i have a picture here from a video , and we 're now going to play it .
teacher : see what happens . keep going .
child : tv .
child : oh my god .
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens .
move away from it and come back to it .
child : oh , that is so cool .
teacher : and then , have you got it again ?
child : oh my god ! how did you do that ?
second child : it 's magic .
mm : so , it 's not magic .
it 's available for everyone to do , and actually i 'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now .
so , as sort of -- i 'm told it 's called a stadium wave , so we 're going to start from this side of the room on the count of three , and go over to here .
tamara , are you recording ?
okay , so are you all ready ?
one , two , three . go !
audience : whooooooo !
mm : fellows are really good at that .
okay . now we 're going to switch back into the aurasma application , and what tamara 's going to do is tag that video that we just took onto my badge , so that i can remember it forever .
now , we have lots of people who are doing this already , and we 've talked a little bit about the educational side .
on the emotional side , we have people who 've done things like send postcards and christmas cards back to their family with little messages on them .
we have people who have , for example , taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine , so that if you 're stuck and you want to find out more , you can point and discover the information .
we 're all very , very familiar with the internet .
in the last 20 years , it 's really changed the way that we live and work , and the way that we see the world , and what 's great is , we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift , because now we can literally take the content that we share , we discover , and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us .
it 's completely free to download this application .
if you have a good wi - fi connection or 3g , this process is very , very quick .
oh , there we are . we can save it now .
it 's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint , and the great thing is , if you 're a professional user , -- so , a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical to what we 've just used to create this demonstration .
the only difference is that you 've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content . are you now ready ?
tamara roukaerts : we 're ready to go .
mm : okay . so , i 'm told we 're ready , which means we can now point at the image , and there you all are .
mm on video : one , two , three . go !
mm : well done . we 've been aurasma . thank you .
