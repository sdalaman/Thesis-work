this is a recent comic strip from the los angeles times .
the punch line ?
" on the other hand , i do n't have to get up at four every single morning to milk my labrador . "
this is a recent cover of new york magazine .
best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment , births , strokes , heart disease , hip replacements , 4 a.m. emergencies .
and this is a song medley i put together -- did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand ?
it means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour .
a time for inconveniences , mishaps , yearnings .
a time for plotting to whack the chief of police , like in this classic scene from " the godfather . "
coppola 's script describes these guys as , " exhausted in shirt sleeves .
it is four in the morning . "
a time for even grimmer stuff than that , like autopsies and embalmings in isabel allende 's " the house of the spirits . "
after the breathtaking green - haired rosa is murdered , the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians ' paste .
they worked until four o'clock in the morning .
a time for even grimmer stuff than that , like in last april 's new yorker magazine .
this short fiction piece by martin amis starts out , " on september 11 , 2001 , he opened his eyes at 4 a.m. in portland , maine , and mohamed atta 's last day began . "
for a time that i find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day , four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press -- across a lot of different media from a lot of big names .
and it made me suspicious .
i figured , surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world , really , are n't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it , right ?
could it be there is something more going on here ?
something deliberate , something secret , and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway ?
i say this guy -- alberto giacometti , shown here with some of his sculptures on the swiss 100 franc note .
he did it with this famous piece from the new york museum of modern art .
its title -- " the palace at four in the morning -- 1932 .
not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning i can find .
i believe that this so - called first surrealist sculpture may provide an incredible key to virtually every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it .
i call this the giacometti code , a ted exclusive .
no , feel free to follow along on your blackberries or your iphones if you 've got them .
it works a little something like -- this is a recent google search for four in the morning .
results vary , of course . this is pretty typical .
the top 10 results yield you four hits for faron young 's song , " it 's four in the morning , " three hits for judi dench 's film , " four in the morning , " one hit for wislawa szymborska 's poem , " four in the morning . "
but what , you may ask , do a polish poet , a british dame , a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally excellent google ranking ?
well , let 's start with faron young -- who was born incidentally in 1932 .
in 1996 , he shot himself in the head on december ninth -- which incidentally is judi dench 's birthday .
but he did n't die on dench 's birthday .
he languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self - inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 -- which incidentally is how old alberto giacometti was when he died .
where was wislawa szymborska during all this ?
she has the world 's most absolutely watertight alibi .
on that very day , december 10 , 1996 while mr. four in the morning , faron young , was giving up the ghost in nashville , tennessee , ms. four in the morning -- or one of them anyway -- wislawa szymborska was in stockholm , sweden , accepting the nobel prize for literature .
100 years to the day after the death of alfred nobel himself .
coincidence ? no , it 's creepy .
coincidence to me has a much simpler metric .
that 's like me telling you , " hey , you know the nobel prize was established in 1901 , which coincidentally is the same year alberto giacometti was born ? "
no , not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm , but that does not mean there 's not something going on at the highest possible levels .
in fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we 're about to see .
video : homer simpson : we have a tennis court , a swimming pool , a screening room -- you mean if i want pork chops , even in the middle of the night , your guy will fry them up ?
herbert powell : sure , that 's what he 's paid for .
now do you need towels , laundry , maids ?
hs : wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait -- let me see if i got this straight .
it is christmas day , 4 a.m.
there 's a rumble in my stomach .
marge simpson : homer , please .
rives : wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
let me see if i got this straight , matt .
when homer simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock , but the whole freaking calendar , he comes up with 0400 on the birthday of the baby jesus .
and no , i do n't know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme of things , but obviously i know a coded message when i see one .
i said , i know a coded message when i see one .
and folks , you can buy a copy of bill clinton 's " my life " from the bookstore here at ted .
parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want .
or you can go to the random house website where there is this excerpt .
and how far down into it you figure we 'll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket ?
would you believe about a dozen paragraphs ?
this is page 474 on your paperbacks if you 're following along : " though it was getting better , i still was n't satisfied with the inaugural address .
my speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on inauguration day , i was still changing it . "
sure you were , because you 've prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you .
and then -- three paragraphs later we get this little beauty : " we went back to blair house to look at the speech for the last time .
it had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m. "
well , how could it have ?
by his own writing , this man was either asleep , at a prayer meeting with al and tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase .
what happens to american presidents at 0400 on inauguration day ?
what happened to william jefferson clinton ?
we might not ever know .
and i noticed , he 's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions .
it could get awkward , right ?
i mean after all , this whole business happened on his watch .
but if he were here -- he might remind us , as he does in the wrap - up to his fine autobiography , that on this day bill clinton began a journey -- a journey that saw him go on to become the first democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades .
in generations .
the first since this man , franklin delano roosevelt , who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election , way back in a simpler time , way back in 1932 -- the year alberto giacometti made " the palace at four in the morning . "
the year , let 's remember , that this voice , now departed , first came a - cryin ' into this big old crazy world of ours .
