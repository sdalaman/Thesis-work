so , where are the robots ?
we 've been told for 40 years already that they 're coming soon .
very soon they 'll be doing everything for us .
they 'll be cooking , cleaning , buying things , shopping , building . but they are n't here .
meanwhile , we have illegal immigrants doing all the work , but we do n't have any robots .
so what can we do about that ? what can we say ?
so i want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way .
and this is an x - ray picture of a real beetle , and a swiss watch , back from '88 . you look at that -- what was true then is certainly true today .
we can still make the pieces . we can make the right pieces .
we can make the circuitry of the right computational power , but we ca n't actually put them together to make something that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems .
so let 's try to look at it from a different perspective .
let 's summon the best designer , the mother of all designers .
let 's see what evolution can do for us .
so we threw in -- we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars , with motors , with neurons .
put them all together , and put all this under kind of natural selection , under mutation , and rewarded things for how well they can move forward .
a very simple task , and it 's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that .
so if you look , you can see a lot of different machines come out of this . they all move around .
they all crawl in different ways , and you can see on the right , that we actually made a couple of these things , and they work in reality . these are not very fantastic robots , but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for : for moving forward . so that was all done in simulation , but we can also do that on a real machine .
here 's a physical robot that we actually have a population of brains , competing , or evolving on the machine .
it 's like a rodeo show . they all get a ride on the machine , and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward .
and you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet , but they gradually learn how to move forward , and they do this autonomously .
so in these two examples , we had basically machines that learned how to walk in simulation , and also machines that learned how to walk in reality .
but i want to show you a different approach , and this is this robot over here , which has four legs .
it has eight motors , four on the knees and four on the hip .
it has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way it 's tilting .
but this machine does n't know what it looks like .
you look at it and you see it has four legs , the machine does n't know if it 's a snake , if it 's a tree , it does n't have any idea what it looks like , but it 's going to try to find that out .
initially , it does some random motion , and then it tries to figure out what it might look like .
and you 're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds , a lot of self - models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing . it then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models , like a scientist in a lab. then it does that and tries to explain that , and prune out its self - models .
this is the last cycle , and you can see it 's pretty much figured out what its self looks like . and once it has a self - model , it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion .
so what you 're seeing here are a couple of machines -- a pattern of locomotion .
we were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil , spidery walk , but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward .
but when you look at that , you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward , nor did it have a model of itself .
it kind of figured out what it looks like , and how to move forward , and then actually tried that out .
so , we 'll move forward to a different idea .
so that was what happened when we had a couple of -- that 's what happened when you had a couple of -- ok , ok , ok -- -- they do n't like each other . so there 's a different robot .
that 's what happened when the robots actually are rewarded for doing something .
what happens if you do n't reward them for anything , you just throw them in ?
so we have these cubes , like the diagram showed here .
the cube can swivel , or flip on its side , and we just throw 1,000 of these cubes into a soup -- this is in simulation -- and do n't reward them for anything , we just let them flip . we pump energy into this and see what happens in a couple of mutations .
so , initially nothing happens , they 're just flipping around there .
but after a very short while , you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over .
they begin to self - replicate . so in absence of any reward , the intrinsic reward is self - replication .
and we 've actually built a couple of these , and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes .
it 's an accelerated view , where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process .
so you 're feeding it with more material -- cubes in this case -- and more energy , and it can make another robot .
so of course , this is a very crude machine , but we 're working on a micro - scale version of these , and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in .
ok , so what can we learn ? these robots are of course not very useful in themselves , but they might teach us something about how we can build better robots , and perhaps how humans , animals , create self - models and learn .
and one of the things that i think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually , but actually let them evolve and learn , like children , and perhaps that 's the way we 'll get there . thank you .
