it 's really quite an honor to be here tonight , and i 'm really glad that i stayed here and listened because i 've really been inspired .
and i 'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are , literally , world premieres .
i 've been working on my new record and i 've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone .
this is a song that i wrote about the meaning of technology , which goes perfectly with this gathering .
i started thinking about -- when i was in college , especially as a blind person , doing a research paper was a major undertaking .
you had to go to the library , see if you could get them to find the books for you , you know , footnotes and all that .
now you can just go on google . just look it up .
i wish i had that when i was in college .
anyway , this is a song about : we have all this , but what are we going to do with it ?
it 's called " all the answers . "
♫ what is the weather in cincinnati ? ♫ ♫ what is the time in tokyo ? ♫ ♫ who is this little child 's daddy ? ♫ ♫ and who the hell needs to know ? ♫ ♫ why do memories of you linger ♫ ♫ when i 'm trying to reach my goal ? ♫ ♫ and why must i move my fingers ♫ ♫ to the music in my soul ? ♫ ♫ i do n't know . ♫ ♫ i do n't have to know . ♫ ♫ ' cause here i go ... ♫ ♫ and i got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here in my hand . ♫ ♫ and i got all the answers ♫ ♫ and i do n't have to understand ♫ ♫ ' cause i got all the answers . ♫ ♫ think i 'll rummage through the century ♫ ♫ while i listen to the sea . ♫ ♫ oh , it 's good to be so free , ♫ ♫ so free . ♫ ♫ who was mayor of chicago ♫ ♫ back in 1964 ? ♫ ♫ and why did shakespeare create iago ♫ ♫ to tear apart a love so pure ? ♫ ♫ how can my dreams be so vivid ♫ ♫ in a psychosonic way ? ♫ ♫ why must i become so livid ♫ ♫ about the news i hear today ? ♫ ♫ i do n't know . ♫ ♫ i do n't have to know . ♫ ♫ and here i go ... ♫ ♫ ' cause i got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here in my hand . ♫ ♫ and i got all the answers . ♫ ♫ see , i do n't have to understand ♫ ♫ ' cause i got all the answers . ♫ ♫ i think i 'll browse on through ♫ ♫ the tabloid news ♫ ♫ while i sip my tea . ♫ ♫ mm , it 's good to be so free . ♫ ♫ i never ever have to be alone . ♫ ♫ i can do it all right here in my home . ♫ ♫ yeah , mm - hmm ... ♫ ♫ everything that 's ever been known , ♫ ♫ i can punch it up right here on my phone . ♫ ♫ freedom train , coming soon ♫ ♫ right here in my living room ♫ ♫ from baton rouge to saskatoon ♫ ♫ and all points in between . ♫ ♫ ' cause i got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here on my screen . ♫ ♫ and i got all the answers , yeah . ♫ ♫ i got every book and magazine . ♫ ♫ i got all , i got all , i got all ... ♫ ♫ i got all the answers , ♫ ♫ all the answers , oh yeah . ♫ ♫ uh - huh ... ♫ ♫ but i tell you what i 'm going to do : ♫ ♫ i 'm going to find the capitol of peru ♫ ♫ or the latitude of kathmandu . ♫ ♫ i 'm gonna google it ♫ ♫ ' cause everybody 's doing it . ♫ ♫ and then i 'll rummage through the century . ♫ ♫ i got all , i got all , i got all ... ♫ ♫ i got all the answers . ♫ ♫ yeah , yeah ♫ ♫ i got all the answers . ♫ thank you .
whew ! it 's a miracle i did n't make any mistakes on that song .
that 's the first time i 've ever played it .
it 's a " feel the fear and do it anyway " kind of thing .
this next song is a song that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream .
it was one of the titles that i was sort of thinking about calling my record , except there 's a couple of problems .
one thing is , it 's unpronounceable .
and it 's a made - up word .
it 's called " tembererana . "
and the song is based on what i think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces .
so " tembererana " was these dreams , in which i would be running away from bad feelings -- is the only way i can put it .
so this is called " tembererana . "
it 's based on an argentinian rhythm called " carnivalito . "
