i went to aspen recently and stumbled into this song .
♫ black men go to aspen ♫ ♫ and rent colorful chalets . ♫ ♫ giggle at the questions ♫ ♫ their mere presence seems to raise . ♫ ♫ get taken for men ♫ ♫ we do n't resemble in the least . ♫ " are you ... ? "
" no. "
♫ it 's a winter wonderland ♫ ♫ in the belly of the beast . ♫ ♫ and black men ski . ♫ ♫ black men ski . ♫ ♫ black men send back sushi ♫ ♫ with a scorned yakuza 's flair . ♫ ♫ we make postmodern art ♫ ♫ with bacon grease ♫ ♫ and hot combed hair . ♫ ♫ we secretly play beethoven ♫ ♫ inside our bassmobiles . ♫ ♫ we can tell you how cool looks ♫ ♫ but cannot show you how it feels ♫ ♫ when black men ski . ♫ ♫ when black men ski . ♫ ♫ black men now are students ♫ ♫ of gay sensibility . ♫ ♫ we wear ironic t - shirts ♫ ♫ drenched in code unknown to thee . ♫ ♫ we get baptized in walden pond ♫ ♫ amongst a searing mob ♫ ♫ because the cleansing blood of jesus ♫ ♫ could not do a thorough job . ♫ ♫ black men ski . ♫ ♫ black men ski . ♫ ♫ chinese guys can jump real high ♫ ♫ and germans cook soul food . ♫ ♫ white boys rap and hippies nap ♫ ♫ their dreads up to look rude . ♫ ♫ jazz is now suburban ♫ ♫ it 's marsalisly clean . ♫ ♫ and now we 've got viagra ♫ ♫ everyone 's a sex machine . ♫ ♫ so black men ski . ♫ what else can we do ?
♫ black men ski . ♫ ♫ black men ski . ♫ ♫ black men ski . ♫ ♫ some kids i 'll describe as friends ♫ ♫ say i am race - obsessed . ♫ ♫ the luxury of your opinion ♫ ♫ shows that you are blessed . ♫ ♫ see , i have poems about sunsets ♫ ♫ flowers and the rain . ♫ ♫ i 've read them to policemen ♫ ♫ but it was all in vain . ♫ ♫ so black men ski . ♫ ♫ black men ski ... ♫ elegantly .
