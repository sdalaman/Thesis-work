i 'm not quite sure whether i really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning .
but anyway , it 's just great to see such a full theater , and really i must thank herbie hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation .
one of the interesting things , of course , is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology , and of course what he said about listening to our young people .
of course , my job is all about listening , and my aim , really , is to teach the world to listen .
that 's my only real aim in life .
and it sounds quite simple , but actually it 's quite a big , big job .
because you know , when you look at a piece of music -- for example , if i just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here , hopefully , a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page .
and , you know , we open it up and i read the music .
so technically , i can actually read this .
i will follow the instructions , the tempo markings , the dynamics .
i will do exactly as i 'm told .
and so therefore , because time is short , if i just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so . it 's very straightforward .
there 's nothing too difficult about the piece .
but here i 'm being told that the piece of music is very quick .
i 'm being told where to play on the drum .
i 'm being told which part of the stick to use .
and i 'm being told the dynamic .
and i 'm also being told that the drum is without snares .
snares on , snares off .
so therefore , if i translate this piece of music , we have this idea .
and so on . my career would probably last about five years .
however , what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music .
everything that there is n't time to learn from a teacher , or to talk about , even , from a teacher .
but it 's the things that you notice when you 're not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting , and that you want to explore through this tiny , tiny surface of a drum .
so there , we experience the translation . now we 'll experience the interpretation .
now my career may last a little longer !
but in a way , you know , it 's the same if i look at you and i see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on .
i see that you 're clutching a teddy bear , etc. , etc.
so i get a basic idea as to what you might be about , what you might like , what you might do as a profession , etc. , etc.
however , that 's just , you know , the initial idea i may have that we all get when we actually look , and we try to interpret , but actually it 's so unbelievably shallow .
in the same way , i look at the music ; i get a basic idea ; i wonder what technically might be hard , or , you know , what i want to do .
just the basic feeling .
however , that is simply not enough .
and i think what herbie said -- please listen , listen .
we have to listen to ourselves , first of all .
if i play , for example , holding the stick -- where literally i do not let go of the stick -- you 'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm .
and you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick , even though i 'm actually holding the stick quite tightly .
by holding it tightly , i feel strangely more detached .
if i just simply let go and allow my hand , my arm , to be more of a support system , suddenly i have more dynamic with less effort . much more .
and i just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum .
and i 'm doing far , far less .
so in the same way that i need time with this instrument , i need time with people in order to interpret them .
not just translate them , but interpret them .
if , for example , i play just a few bars of a piece of music for which i think of myself as a technician -- that is , someone who is basically a percussion player ...
and so on . if i think of myself as a musician ...
and so on . there is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- -- thinking about .
and i remember when i was 12 years old , and i started playing tympani and percussion , and my teacher said , " well , how are we going to do this ? you know , music is about listening . "
and i said , " yes , i agree with that . so what 's the problem ? "
and he said , " well , how are you going to hear this ? how are you going to hear that ? "
and i said , " well , how do you hear it ? "
he said , " well , i think i hear it through here . "
and i said , " well , i think i do too -- but i also hear it through my hands , through my arms , cheekbones , my scalp , my tummy , my chest , my legs and so on . "
and so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums -- in particular , the kettle drums , or tympani -- to such a narrow pitch interval , so something like ...
that of a difference . then gradually ... and gradually ...
and it 's amazing that when you do open your body up , and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through , that in fact the tiny , tiny difference ...
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger , there .
and so what we would do is that i would put my hands on the wall of the music room , and together we would " listen " to the sounds of the instruments , and really try to connect with those sounds far , far more broadly than simply depending on the ear .
because of course , the ear is , i mean , subject to all sorts of things .
the room we happen to be in , the amplification , the quality of the instrument , the type of sticks ... etc. , etc.
they 're all different .
same amount of weight , but different sound colors .
and that 's basically what we are . we 're just human beings , but we all have our own little sound colors , as it were , that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things .
and as i grew older , i then auditioned for the royal academy of music in london , and they said , " well , no , we wo n't accept you , because we have n't a clue , you know , of the future of a so - called ' deaf ' musician . "
and i just could n't quite accept that .
and so therefore , i said to them , " well , look , if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons , as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very , very hard about the people you do actually accept . "
and as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle , and having to audition twice -- they accepted me . and not only that -- what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the united kingdom .
under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms , no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand .
no circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry .
and every single entry had to be listened to , experienced and then based on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not .
so therefore , this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions .
and i have to say , many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world .
the interesting thing about this as well , though -- -- is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -- which is basically all of us , and we well know that music really is our daily medicine .
i say " music , " but actually i mean " sound . "
because you know , some of the extraordinary things i 've experienced as a musician , when you may have a 15 - year - old lad who has got the most incredible challenges , who may not be able to control his movements , who may be deaf , who may be blind , etc. , etc. -- suddenly , if that young lad sits close to this instrument , and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba , and you play something that 's so incredibly organ - like , almost -- i do n't really have the right sticks , perhaps -- but something like this . let me change .
something that 's so unbelievably simple -- but he would be experiencing something that i would n't be , because i 'm on top of the sound .
i have the sound coming this way .
he would have the sound coming through the resonators .
if there were no resonators on here , we would have ...
so he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows would n't experience , those of you in the back few rows would n't experience either .
every single one of us , depending on where we 're sitting , will experience this sound quite , quite differently .
and of course , being the participator of the sound , and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound i want to produce -- for example , this sound .
can you hear anything ?
exactly . because i 'm not even touching it .
but yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
in the same way that when i see tree moves , then i imagine that tree making a rustling sound .
do you see what i mean ?
whatever the eye sees , then there 's always sound happening .
so there 's always , always that huge -- i mean , just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from .
so all of my performances are based on entirely what i experience , and not by learning a piece of music , putting on someone else 's interpretation of it , buying all the cds possible of that particular piece of music , and so on and so forth .
because that is n't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic , and something that i can fully experience the journey of .
so it may be that , in certain halls , this dynamic may well work .
it may be that in other halls , they 're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore , my level of soft , gentle playing may have to be ...
do you see what i mean ? so , because of this explosion in access to sound , especially through the deaf community , this has not only affected how music institutions , how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course , being a participator of music , that definitely is the case as well .
but it 's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together . there are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics , dare i say . but by that i mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine .
the tiniest , softest , softest sound to something that is so broad , so huge , so incredible ! there 's always something -- it may sound good up there , may not be so good there .
may be great there , but terrible up there .
maybe terrible over there , but not too bad there , etc. , etc.
so to find an actual hall is incredible -- for which you can play exactly what you imagine , without it being cosmetically enhanced .
and so therefore , acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired , and who are participators of sound .
and this is quite interesting .
i cannot , you know , give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls , but it 's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we 've been saying , " well , how on earth can they experience music ? you know , they 're deaf . "
we just -- we go like that , and we imagine that that 's what deafness is about .
or we go like that , and we imagine that 's what blindness is about .
if we see someone in a wheelchair , we assume they cannot walk .
it may be that they can walk three , four , five steps . that , to them , means they can walk .
in a year 's time , it could be two extra steps .
in another year 's time , three extra steps .
those are hugely important aspects to think about .
so when we do listen to each other , it 's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills , to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber , to stop the judgment .
for me , as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music , it 's very easy for me to say , " oh yes , i like that piece .
oh no , i do n't like that piece . " and so on .
and you know , i just find that i have to give those pieces of music real time .
it may be that the chemistry is n't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music , but that does n't mean i have the right to say it 's a bad piece of music .
and you know , it 's just one of the great things about being a musician , is that it is so unbelievably fluid .
so there are no rules , no right , no wrong , this way , that way .
if i asked you to clap -- maybe i can do this .
if i can just say , " please clap and create the sound of thunder . "
i 'm assuming we 've all experienced thunder .
now , i do n't mean just the sound ; i mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves .
and please try to create that through your clapping . try . just -- please try .
very good ! snow . snow . have you ever heard snow ?
audience : no.
evelyn glennie : well then , stop clapping . try again .
try again . snow .
see , you 're awake .
rain . not bad . not bad .
you know , the interesting thing here , though , is that i asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question .
now -- great imagination , thank you very much .
however , not one of you got out of your seats to think , " right ! how can i clap ? ok , maybe ...
maybe i can use my jewelry to create extra sounds .
maybe i can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds . "
not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands .
in the same way that when we listen to music , we assume that it 's all being fed through here .
this is how we experience music . of course it 's not .
we experience thunder -- thunder , thunder . think , think , think .
listen , listen , listen . now -- what can we do with thunder ?
i remember my teacher . when i first started , my very first lesson , i was all prepared with sticks , ready to go .
and instead of him saying , " ok , evelyn , please , feet slightly apart , arms at a more - or - less 90 degree angle , sticks in a more - or - less v shape , keep this amount of space here , etc.
please keep your back straight , etc. , etc. , etc. " -- where i was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid , frozen , and i would not be able to strike the drum , because i was thinking of so many other things -- he said , " evelyn , take this drum away for seven days , and i 'll see you next week . "
so , heavens ! what was i to do ? i no longer required the sticks ; i was n't allowed to have these sticks .
i had to basically look at this particular drum , see how it was made , what these little lugs did , what the snares did .
turned it upside down , experimented with the shell , experimented with the head .
experimented with my body , experimented with jewelry , experimented with all sorts of things .
and of course , i returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that -- but nevertheless , it was such an unbelievable experience , because then , where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music ?
where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book ?
so we never , ever dealt with actual study books .
so for example , one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player , as opposed to a musician , is basically straightforward single stroke rolls .
like that . and then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster .
and so on and so forth . what does this piece require ?
single stroke rolls . so why ca n't i then do that whilst learning a piece of music ?
and that 's exactly what he did .
and interestingly , the older i became , and when i became a full - time student at a so called " music institution , " all of that went out of the window .
we had to study from study books .
and constantly , the question , " well , why ? why ? what is this relating to ?
i need to play a piece of music . " " oh , well , this will help your control ! "
" well , how ? why do i need to learn that ? i need to relate it to a piece of music .
you know . i need to say something .
" why am i practicing paradiddles ?
is it just literally for control , for hand - stick control ? why am i doing that ?
i need to have the reason , and the reason has to be by saying something through the music . "
and by saying something through music , which basically is sound , we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people .
but i do n't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage .
that 's up to you , when you walk through a hall .
because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things .
i may feel sorrowful , or happy , or exhilarated , or angry when i play certain pieces of music , but i 'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing .
so please , the next time you go to a concert , just allow your body to open up , allow your body to be this resonating chamber .
be aware that you 're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is .
the performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound , because they 're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum , or the mallet on the bit of wood , or the bow on the string , etc. , or the breath that 's creating the sound from wind and brass .
they 're experiencing that rawness there .
but yet they 're experiencing something so unbelievably pure , which is before the sound is actually happening .
please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike , or breath , is being pulled . just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that i wished i 'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference , rather than just arriving last night .
but i hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses .
but thank you very much for having me !
