with all the legitimate concerns about aids and avian flu -- and we 'll hear about that from the brilliant dr. brilliant later today -- i want to talk about the other pandemic , which is cardiovascular disease , diabetes , hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle .
and what 's happening is that there 's a globalization of illness occurring , that people are starting to eat like us , and live like us , and die like us . and in one generation , for example , asia 's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest . and in africa , cardiovascular disease equals the hiv and aids deaths in most countries .
so there 's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people , and practice preventive medicine on a global scale .
heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country , but also worldwide -- than everything else combined , and yet it 's completely preventable for almost everybody .
it 's not only preventable ; it 's actually reversible . and for the last almost 29 years , we 've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle , using these very high - tech , expensive , state - of - the - art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low - tech and low - cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography , before and after a year , and cardiac pet scans .
we showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle , and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth , or inhibition of the tumor growth , compared to only nine percent in the control group .
and in the mri and mr spectroscopy here , the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year .
now there is an epidemic of obesity : two - thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids . what 's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years , and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do . that 's pitiful , and it 's preventable .
now these are not election returns , these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state , beginning in '85 , '86 , '87 -- these are from the cdc website -- '88 , '89 , '90 , '91 -- you get a new category -- '92 , '93 , '94 , '95 , '96 , '97 , '98 , '99 , 2000 , 2001 -- it gets worse . we 're kind of devolving .
now what can we do about this ? well , you know , the diet that we 've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an asian diet .
but the people in asia are starting to eat like we are , which is why they 're starting to get sick like we are .
so i 've been working with a lot of the big food companies . they can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods , like -- i chair the advisory boards to mcdonald 's , and pepsico , and conagra , and safeway , and soon del monte , and they 're finding that it 's good business .
the salads that you see at mcdonald 's came from the work -- they 're going to have an asian salad . at pepsi , two - thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods .
and so if we can do that , then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating aids and hiv and malaria and for preventing avian flu . thank you .
