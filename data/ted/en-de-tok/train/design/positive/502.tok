i	started	with	paragliding	.
paragliding	is	taking	off	from	mountains	with	a	paraglider	,	with	the	possibility	to	fly	cross	-	country	,	distance	,	just	with	the	use	of	thermals	to	soar	.
also	different	aerobatic	maneuvers	are	possible	with	a	paraglider	.
from	there	i	started	with	skydiving	.
in	this	picture	you	can	see	there	is	a	four	-	way	skydive	,	four	people	flying	together	,	and	on	the	left	hand	side	it	's	the	camera	flyer	with	the	camera	mounted	to	his	helmet	so	he	can	film	the	whole	jump	,	for	the	film	itself	and	also	for	the	judging	.
from	regular	,	relative	skydiving	i	went	on	to	freeflying	.
freeflying	is	more	the	three	-	dimensional	skydiving	.
you	can	see	the	skydiver	with	the	red	suit	,	he	's	in	a	stand	-	up	position	.
the	one	with	the	yellow	-	green	suit	,	he	's	flying	head	-	down	.
and	that	's	me	in	the	background	,	carving	around	the	whole	formation	in	freefall	also	,	with	the	helmet	cam	to	film	this	jump	.
from	freeflying	i	went	on	to	skysurfing	.
skysurfing	is	skydiving	with	a	board	on	the	feet	.
you	can	imagine	with	this	big	surface	of	a	skysurfing	board	,	there	is	a	lot	of	force	,	a	lot	of	power	.
of	course	i	can	use	this	power	for	example	for	nice	spinning	--	we	call	it	``	helicopter	moves	.	``
from	there	i	went	on	to	wingsuit	flying	.
wingsuit	flying	is	a	suit	,	that	i	can	make	fly	,	just	only	with	my	body	.
if	i	put	some	tension	on	my	body	,	tension	on	my	suit	,	i	can	make	it	fly	.	and	as	you	see	the	fall	rate	is	much	much	slower	because	of	the	bigger	surface	.
with	a	proper	body	position	i	'm	able	to	really	move	forward	to	gain	quite	some	distance	.
this	is	a	jump	i	did	in	rio	de	janeiro	.
you	can	see	the	copacabana	on	the	left	-	hand	side	.
from	there	with	all	the	skills	and	knowledge	from	paragliding	and	all	the	different	disciplines	in	skydiving	,	i	went	on	to	base	jumping	.
base	jumping	is	skydiving	from	fixed	objects	,	like	buildings	,	antennae	,	bridges	and	earth	--	meaning	mountains	,	cliffs	.
it	's	for	sure	--	for	me	--	it	's	the	ultimate	feeling	of	being	in	free	fall	,	with	all	the	visual	references	.
so	my	goal	soon	was	to	discover	new	places	that	nobody	had	jumped	before	.
so	in	summer	2000	i	was	the	first	to	base	jump	the	eiger	north	face	in	switzerland	.
two	years	after	this	,	i	was	the	first	to	base	jump	from	matterhorn	,	a	very	famous	mountain	that	probably	everybody	knows	in	here	.
2005	i	did	a	base	jump	from	the	eiger	,	from	the	monk	and	from	the	jungfrau	,	three	very	famous	mountains	in	switzerland	.
the	special	thing	on	these	three	jumps	were	,	i	hiked	them	all	and	climbed	them	all	in	only	one	day	.
in	2008	i	jumped	the	eiffel	tower	in	paris	.
so	with	all	this	knowledge	,	i	also	wanted	to	get	into	stunts	.
so	with	some	friends	we	started	to	do	different	tricks	,	like	for	example	this	jump	here	,	i	jumped	from	a	paraglider	.
or	here	--	everybody	was	freezing	,	pretty	much	,	except	me	,	because	it	was	very	cold	in	austria	where	we	did	this	filming	.
everybody	sitting	in	a	basket	,	and	i	was	on	top	of	the	balloon	,	ready	to	slide	down	with	my	skysurf	board	.
or	this	jump	,	from	a	moving	truck	on	the	highway	.
extreme	sports	on	top	level	like	this	is	only	possible	if	you	practice	step	by	step	,	if	you	really	work	hard	on	your	skills	and	on	your	knowledge	.
of	course	you	need	to	be	in	physical	,	very	good	,	condition	,	so	i	'm	training	a	lot	.
you	need	to	have	the	best	possible	equipment	.
and	probably	the	most	important	is	you	have	to	work	on	your	mental	skills	,	mental	preparation	.
and	all	this	to	come	as	close	as	possible	to	the	human	dream	of	being	able	to	fly	.
so	for	2009	,	i	'm	training	hard	for	my	two	new	projects	.
the	first	one	,	i	want	to	set	a	world	record	in	flying	from	a	cliff	with	my	wingsuit	.
and	i	want	to	set	a	new	record	,	with	the	longest	distance	ever	flown	.
for	my	second	project	,	i	have	a	sensational	idea	of	a	jump	that	never	has	been	done	before	.
so	now	,	on	the	following	movie	you	will	see	that	i	'm	much	better	in	flying	a	wingsuit	than	speaking	in	english	.
enjoy	,	and	thank	you	very	much	.
june	cohen	:	i	have	some	questions	.
i	think	we	all	might	have	some	questions	.
question	one	:	so	does	that	actually	feel	the	way	the	flying	dream	does	?
because	it	looks	like	it	might	.
ueli	gegenschatz	:	pretty	much	.	i	believe	this	is	probably	the	closest	possibility	to	come	to	the	dream	of	being	able	to	fly	.
jc	:	i	know	the	answer	to	this	,	but	how	do	you	land	?
ue	:	parachute	.	we	have	to	open	a	parachute	just	seconds	before	,	i	would	say	,	impact	.
it	's	not	possible	to	land	a	wingsuit	yet	.
jc	:	yet	.	but	people	are	trying	.	are	you	among	those	--	you	're	not	going	to	commit	--	are	you	among	those	trying	to	do	it	?
ue	:	it	's	a	dream	.	it	's	a	dream	.	yeah	.
we	're	still	working	on	it	and	we	're	developing	the	wingsuits	to	get	better	performance	,	to	get	more	knowledge	.
and	i	believe	soon	.
jc	:	all	right	.	well	we	will	watch	this	space	.	but	i	have	two	more	questions	.
what	is	the	--	there	was	exhaust	coming	out	of	the	back	of	the	wingsuit	.	was	that	a	propelled	wingsuit	that	you	were	wearing	?
ue	:	nope	.	it	's	just	smoke	.
jc	:	coming	off	of	you	?
ue	:	hopefully	not	.
jc	:	that	seems	dangerous	.
ue	:	no	,	smoke	is	for	two	reasons	,	you	can	see	the	speed	,	you	can	see	the	way	where	i	was	flying	.
that	's	reason	number	one	.	and	reason	number	two	:	it	's	much	easier	for	the	camera	guy	to	film	if	i	'm	using	smoke	.
jc	:	ah	,	i	see	.	so	the	wingsuit	is	set	up	to	deliberately	release	smoke	so	that	you	can	be	tracked	.	one	more	question	.
what	do	you	do	to	to	cover	your	face	?
because	i	just	keep	thinking	of	going	that	fast	and	having	your	whole	face	smushed	backwards	.
are	you	in	a	helmet	?	are	you	in	goggles	?
ue	:	the	purest	and	the	best	feeling	would	be	with	only	goggles	.
jc	:	and	is	that	how	you	usually	fly	?
ue	:	usually	i	'm	wearing	a	helmet	.	in	the	mountains	i	'm	always	wearing	a	helmet	because	of	landings	--	usually	it	's	difficult	--	it	's	not	like	regular	skydiving	where	you	have	like	the	big	landings	.
so	you	have	to	be	prepared	.
jc	:	right	.	now	is	there	anything	you	do	n't	do	?
do	people	come	to	you	with	projects	and	say	,	``	we	want	you	to	do	this	!	``
and	do	you	ever	say	,	``	no	,	no	i	'm	not	going	to	.	``
ue	:	oh	of	course	,	of	course	.	some	people	have	crazy	ideas	and	--	jc	:	...	a	round	of	applause	...
ue	:	thank	you	very	much	.
