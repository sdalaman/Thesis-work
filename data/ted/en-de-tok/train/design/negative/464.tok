chris	anderson	:	let	's	now	see	the	extraordinary	speech	that	we	captured	a	couple	weeks	ago	.
jose	antonio	abreu	:	my	dear	friends	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	,	i	am	overjoyed	today	at	being	awarded	the	ted	prize	on	behalf	of	all	the	distinguished	music	teachers	,	artists	and	educators	from	venezuela	who	have	selflessly	and	loyally	accompanied	me	for	35	years	in	founding	,	growing	and	developing	in	venezuela	the	national	system	of	youth	and	children	's	orchestras	and	choirs	.
since	i	was	a	boy	,	in	my	early	childhood	,	i	always	wanted	to	be	a	musician	,	and	,	thank	god	,	i	made	it	.
from	my	teachers	,	my	family	and	my	community	,	i	had	all	the	necessary	support	to	become	a	musician	.
all	my	life	i	've	dreamed	that	all	venezuelan	children	have	the	same	opportunity	that	i	had	.
from	that	desire	and	from	my	heart	stemmed	the	idea	to	make	music	a	deep	and	global	reality	for	my	country	.
from	the	very	first	rehearsal	,	i	saw	the	bright	future	ahead	.
because	the	rehearsal	meant	a	great	challenge	to	me	.
i	had	received	a	donation	of	50	music	stands	to	be	used	by	100	boys	in	that	rehearsal	.
when	i	arrived	at	the	rehearsal	,	only	11	kids	had	shown	up	,	and	i	said	to	myself	,	``	do	i	close	the	program	or	multiply	these	kids	?	``
i	decided	to	face	the	challenge	,	and	on	that	same	night	,	i	promised	those	11	children	i	'd	turn	our	orchestra	into	one	of	the	leading	orchestras	in	the	world	.
two	months	ago	,	i	remembered	that	promise	i	made	,	when	a	distinguished	english	critic	published	an	article	in	the	london	times	,	asking	who	could	be	the	winner	of	the	orchestra	world	cup	.
he	mentioned	four	great	world	orchestras	,	and	the	fifth	one	was	venezuela	's	youth	symphony	orchestra	.
today	we	can	say	that	art	in	latin	america	is	no	longer	a	monopoly	of	elites	and	that	it	has	become	a	social	right	,	a	right	for	all	the	people	.
child	:	there	is	no	difference	here	between	classes	,	nor	white	or	black	,	nor	if	you	have	money	or	not	.
simply	,	if	you	are	talented	,	if	you	have	the	vocation	and	the	will	to	be	here	,	you	get	in	.	you	share	with	us	and	make	music	.
ja	:	during	the	recent	tour	by	the	simon	bolivar	youth	orchestra	of	venezuela	of	u.s.	and	europe	,	we	saw	how	our	music	moved	young	audiences	to	the	bottom	of	their	souls	,	how	children	and	adolescents	rushed	up	to	the	stage	to	receive	the	jackets	from	our	musicians	,	how	the	standing	ovations	,	sometimes	30	minutes	long	,	seemed	to	last	forever	,	and	how	the	public	,	after	the	concert	was	over	,	went	out	into	the	street	to	greet	our	young	people	in	triumph	.
this	meant	not	only	an	artistic	triumph	,	but	also	a	profound	emotional	sympathy	between	the	public	of	the	most	advanced	nations	of	the	world	and	the	musical	youth	of	latin	america	,	as	seen	in	venezuela	,	giving	these	audiences	a	message	of	music	,	vitality	,	energy	,	enthusiasm	and	strength	.
in	its	essence	,	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	are	much	more	than	artistic	structures	.
they	are	examples	and	schools	of	social	life	,	because	to	sing	and	to	play	together	means	to	intimately	coexist	toward	perfection	and	excellence	,	following	a	strict	discipline	of	organization	and	coordination	in	order	to	seek	the	harmonic	interdependence	of	voices	and	instruments	.
that	's	how	they	build	a	spirit	of	solidarity	and	fraternity	among	them	,	develop	their	self	-	esteem	and	foster	the	ethical	and	aesthetical	values	related	to	the	music	in	all	its	senses	.
this	is	why	music	is	immensely	important	in	the	awakening	of	sensibility	,	in	the	forging	of	values	and	in	the	training	of	youngsters	to	teach	other	kids	.
child	:	after	all	this	time	here	,	music	is	life	.
nothing	else	.
music	is	life	.
ja	:	each	teenager	and	child	in	el	sistema	has	his	own	story	,	and	they	are	all	important	and	of	great	significance	to	me	.
let	me	mention	the	case	of	edicson	ruiz	.
he	is	a	boy	from	a	parish	in	caracas	who	passionately	attended	to	his	double	bass	lessons	at	the	san	agustin	's	junior	orchestra	.
with	his	effort	,	and	the	support	of	his	mother	,	his	family	and	his	community	,	he	became	a	principal	member	in	the	double	bass	segment	of	the	berlin	philharmonic	orchestra	.
we	have	another	well	-	known	case	--	gustavo	dudamel	.
he	started	as	a	boy	member	of	the	children	's	orchestra	in	his	hometown	,	barquisimeto	.
there	,	he	grew	as	a	violinist	and	as	a	conductor	.
he	became	the	conductor	of	venezuela	's	junior	orchestras	,	and	today	conducts	the	world	's	greatest	orchestras	.
he	is	the	musical	director	of	los	angeles	philharmonic	,	and	is	still	the	overall	leader	of	venezuela	's	junior	orchestras	.
he	was	the	conductor	of	the	gothenburg	symphony	orchestra	,	and	he	's	an	unbeatable	example	for	young	musicians	in	latin	america	and	the	world	.
the	structure	of	el	sistema	is	based	on	a	new	and	flexible	managing	style	adapted	to	the	features	of	each	community	and	region	,	and	today	attends	to	300,000	children	of	the	lower	and	middle	class	all	over	venezuela	.
it	's	a	program	of	social	rescue	and	deep	cultural	transformation	designed	for	the	whole	venezuelan	society	with	absolutely	no	distinctions	whatsoever	,	but	emphasizing	the	vulnerable	and	endangered	social	groups	.
the	effect	of	el	sistema	is	felt	in	three	fundamental	circles	:	in	the	personal	/	social	circle	,	in	the	family	circle	and	in	the	community	.
in	the	personal	/	social	circle	,	the	children	in	the	orchestras	and	choirs	develop	their	intellectual	and	emotional	side	.
the	music	becomes	a	source	for	developing	the	dimensions	of	the	human	being	,	thus	elevating	the	spirit	and	leading	man	to	a	full	development	of	his	personality	.
so	,	the	emotional	and	intellectual	profits	are	huge	--	the	acquisition	of	leadership	,	teaching	and	training	principles	,	the	sense	of	commitment	,	responsibility	,	generosity	and	dedication	to	others	,	and	the	individual	contribution	to	achieve	great	collective	goals	.
all	this	leads	to	the	development	of	self	-	esteem	and	confidence	.
mother	teresa	of	calcutta	insisted	on	something	that	always	impressed	me	:	the	most	miserable	and	tragic	thing	about	poverty	is	not	the	lack	of	bread	or	roof	,	but	the	feeling	of	being	no	-	one	--	the	feeling	of	not	being	anyone	,	the	lack	of	identification	,	the	lack	of	public	esteem	.
that	's	why	the	child	's	development	in	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	provides	him	with	a	noble	identity	and	makes	him	a	role	model	for	his	family	and	community	.
it	makes	him	a	better	student	at	school	because	it	inspires	in	him	a	sense	of	responsibility	,	perseverance	and	punctuality	that	will	greatly	help	him	at	school	.
within	the	family	,	the	parents	'	support	is	unconditional	.
the	child	becomes	a	role	model	for	both	his	parents	,	and	this	is	very	important	for	a	poor	child	.
once	the	child	discovers	he	is	important	to	his	family	,	he	begins	to	seek	new	ways	of	improving	himself	and	hopes	better	for	himself	and	his	community	.
also	,	he	hopes	for	social	and	economic	improvements	for	his	own	family	.
all	this	makes	up	a	constructive	and	ascending	social	dynamic	.
the	large	majority	of	our	children	belong	,	as	i	already	mentioned	,	to	the	most	vulnerable	strata	of	the	venezuelan	population	.
that	encourages	them	to	embrace	new	dreams	,	new	goals	,	and	progress	in	the	various	opportunities	that	music	has	to	offer	.
finally	,	in	the	circle	of	the	community	,	the	orchestras	prove	to	be	the	creative	spaces	of	culture	and	sources	of	exchange	and	new	meanings	.
the	spontaneity	music	has	excludes	it	as	a	luxury	item	and	makes	it	a	patrimony	of	society	.
it	's	what	makes	a	child	play	a	violin	at	home	,	while	his	father	works	in	his	carpentry	.
it	's	what	makes	a	little	girl	play	the	clarinet	at	home	,	while	her	mother	does	the	housework	.
the	idea	is	that	the	families	join	with	pride	and	joy	in	the	activities	of	the	orchestras	and	the	choirs	that	their	children	belong	to	.
the	huge	spiritual	world	that	music	produces	in	itself	,	which	also	lies	within	itself	,	ends	up	overcoming	material	poverty	.
from	the	minute	a	child	's	taught	how	to	play	an	instrument	,	he	's	no	longer	poor	.
he	becomes	a	child	in	progress	heading	for	a	professional	level	,	who	'll	later	become	a	full	citizen	.
needless	to	say	that	music	is	the	number	one	prevention	against	prostitution	,	violence	,	bad	habits	,	and	everything	degrading	in	the	life	of	a	child	.
a	few	years	ago	,	historian	arnold	toynbee	said	that	the	world	was	suffering	a	huge	spiritual	crisis	.
not	an	economic	or	social	crisis	,	but	a	spiritual	one	.
i	believe	that	to	confront	such	a	crisis	,	only	art	and	religion	can	give	proper	answers	to	humanity	,	to	mankind	's	deepest	aspirations	,	and	to	the	historic	demands	of	our	times	.
education	--	the	synthesis	of	wisdom	and	knowledge	--	is	the	means	to	strive	for	a	more	perfect	,	more	aware	,	more	noble	and	more	just	society	.
with	passion	and	enthusiasm	we	pay	profound	respects	to	ted	for	its	outstanding	humanism	,	the	scope	of	its	principles	,	for	its	open	and	generous	promotion	of	young	values	.
we	hope	that	ted	can	contribute	in	a	full	and	fundamental	way	to	the	building	of	this	new	era	in	the	teaching	of	music	,	in	which	the	social	,	communal	,	spiritual	and	vindicatory	aims	of	the	child	and	the	adolescent	become	a	beacon	and	a	goal	for	a	vast	social	mission	.
no	longer	putting	society	at	the	service	of	art	,	and	much	less	at	the	services	of	monopolies	of	the	elite	,	but	instead	art	at	the	service	of	society	,	at	the	service	of	the	weakest	,	at	the	service	of	the	children	,	at	the	service	of	the	sick	,	at	the	service	of	the	vulnerable	,	and	at	the	service	of	all	those	who	cry	for	vindication	through	the	spirit	of	their	human	condition	and	the	raising	up	of	their	dignity	.
ca	:	we	are	going	live	now	to	caracas	.
we	are	going	live	to	caracas	to	hear	maestro	abreu	's	ted	prize	wish	.
ja	:	here	is	my	ted	prize	wish	:	i	wish	that	you	'll	help	to	create	and	document	a	special	training	program	for	50	gifted	young	musicians	,	passionate	about	their	art	and	social	justice	,	and	dedicated	to	bringing	el	sistema	to	the	united	states	and	other	countries	.
thank	you	very	much	.
