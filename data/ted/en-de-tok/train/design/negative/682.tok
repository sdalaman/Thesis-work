i	'd	like	to	talk	to	you	today	about	the	scale	of	the	scientific	effort	that	goes	into	making	the	headlines	you	see	in	the	paper	.
headlines	that	look	like	this	when	they	have	to	do	with	climate	change	,	and	headlines	that	look	like	this	when	they	have	to	do	with	air	quality	or	smog	.
they	are	both	two	branches	of	the	same	field	of	atmospheric	science	.
recently	the	headlines	looked	like	this	when	the	intergovernmental	panel	on	climate	change	,	or	ipcc	,	put	out	their	report	on	the	state	of	understanding	of	the	atmospheric	system	.
that	report	was	written	by	620	scientists	from	40	countries	.
they	wrote	almost	a	thousand	pages	on	the	topic	.
and	all	of	those	pages	were	reviewed	by	another	400	-	plus	scientists	and	reviewers	,	from	113	countries	.
it	's	a	big	community	.	it	's	such	a	big	community	,	in	fact	,	that	our	annual	gathering	is	the	largest	scientific	meeting	in	the	world	.
over	15,000	scientists	go	to	san	francisco	every	year	for	that	.
and	every	one	of	those	scientists	is	in	a	research	group	,	and	every	research	group	studies	a	wide	variety	of	topics	.
for	us	at	cambridge	,	it	's	as	varied	as	the	el	ni√±o	oscillation	,	which	affects	weather	and	climate	,	to	the	assimilation	of	satellite	data	,	to	emissions	from	crops	that	produce	biofuels	,	which	is	what	i	happen	to	study	.
and	in	each	one	of	these	research	areas	,	of	which	there	are	even	more	,	there	are	phd	students	,	like	me	,	and	we	study	incredibly	narrow	topics	,	things	as	narrow	as	a	few	processes	or	a	few	molecules	.
and	one	of	the	molecules	i	study	is	called	isoprene	,	which	is	here	.	it	's	a	small	organic	molecule	.	you	've	probably	never	heard	of	it	.
the	weight	of	a	paper	clip	is	approximately	equal	to	900	zeta	-	illion	--	10	to	the	21st	--	molecules	of	isoprene	.
but	despite	its	very	small	weight	,	enough	of	it	is	emitted	into	the	atmosphere	every	year	to	equal	the	weight	of	all	the	people	on	the	planet	.
it	's	a	huge	amount	of	stuff	.	it	's	equal	to	the	weight	of	methane	.
and	because	it	's	so	much	stuff	,	it	's	really	important	for	the	atmospheric	system	.
because	it	's	important	to	the	atmospheric	system	,	we	go	to	all	lengths	to	study	this	thing	.
we	blow	it	up	and	look	at	the	pieces	.
this	is	the	euphore	smog	chamber	in	spain	.
atmospheric	explosions	,	or	full	combustion	,	takes	about	15,000	times	longer	than	what	happens	in	your	car	.
but	still	,	we	look	at	the	pieces	.
we	run	enormous	models	on	supercomputers	;	this	is	what	i	happen	to	do	.
our	models	have	hundreds	of	thousands	of	grid	boxes	calculating	hundreds	of	variables	each	,	on	minute	timescales	.
and	it	takes	weeks	to	perform	our	integrations	.
and	we	perform	dozens	of	integrations	in	order	to	understand	what	's	happening	.
we	also	fly	all	over	the	world	looking	for	this	thing	.
i	recently	joined	a	field	campaign	in	malaysia	.	there	are	others	.
we	found	a	global	atmospheric	watchtower	there	,	in	the	middle	of	the	rainforest	,	and	hung	hundreds	of	thousands	of	dollars	worth	of	scientific	equipment	off	this	tower	,	to	look	for	isoprene	,	and	of	course	,	other	things	while	we	were	there	.
this	is	the	tower	in	the	middle	of	the	rainforest	,	from	above	.
and	this	is	the	tower	from	below	.
and	on	part	of	that	field	campaign	we	even	brought	an	aircraft	with	us	.
and	this	plane	,	the	model	,	ba	146	,	which	was	run	by	faam	,	normally	flies	120	to	130	people	.
so	maybe	you	took	a	similar	aircraft	to	get	here	today	.
but	we	did	n't	just	fly	it	.	we	were	flying	at	100	meters	above	the	top	of	the	canopy	to	measure	this	molecule	--	incredibly	dangerous	stuff	.
we	have	to	fly	at	a	special	incline	in	order	to	make	the	measurements	.
we	hire	military	and	test	pilots	to	do	the	maneuvering	.
we	have	to	get	special	flight	clearance	.
and	as	you	come	around	the	banks	in	these	valleys	,	the	forces	can	get	up	to	two	gs	.
and	the	scientists	have	to	be	completely	harnessed	in	in	order	to	make	measurements	while	they	're	on	board	.
so	,	as	you	can	imagine	,	the	inside	of	this	aircraft	does	n't	look	like	any	plane	you	would	take	on	vacation	.
it	's	a	flying	laboratory	that	we	took	to	make	measurements	in	the	region	of	this	molecule	.
we	do	all	of	this	to	understand	the	chemistry	of	one	molecule	.
and	when	one	student	like	me	has	some	sort	of	inclination	or	understanding	about	that	molecule	,	they	write	one	scientific	paper	on	the	subject	.
and	out	of	that	field	campaign	we	'll	probably	get	a	few	dozen	papers	on	a	few	dozen	processes	or	molecules	.
and	as	a	body	of	knowledge	builds	up	,	it	will	form	one	subsection	,	or	one	sub	-	subsection	of	an	assessment	like	the	ipcc	,	although	we	have	others	.
and	each	one	of	the	11	chapters	of	the	ipcc	has	six	to	ten	subsections	.
so	you	can	imagine	the	scale	of	the	effort	.
in	each	one	of	those	assessments	that	we	write	,	we	always	tag	on	a	summary	,	and	the	summary	is	written	for	a	non	-	scientific	audience	.
and	we	hand	that	summary	to	journalists	and	policy	makers	,	in	order	to	make	headlines	like	these	.
thank	you	very	much	.
