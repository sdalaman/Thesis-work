in	the	year	1919	,	a	virtually	unknown	german	mathematician	,	named	theodor	kaluza	suggested	a	very	bold	and	,	in	some	ways	,	a	very	bizarre	idea	.
he	proposed	that	our	universe	might	actually	have	more	than	the	three	dimensions	that	we	are	all	aware	of	.
that	is	in	addition	to	left	,	right	,	back	,	forth	and	up	,	down	,	kaluza	proposed	that	there	might	be	additional	dimensions	of	space	that	for	some	reason	we	do	n't	yet	see	.
now	,	when	someone	makes	a	bold	and	bizarre	idea	,	sometimes	that	's	all	it	is	--	bold	and	bizarre	,	but	it	has	nothing	to	do	with	the	world	around	us	.
this	particular	idea	,	however	--	although	we	do	n't	yet	know	whether	it	's	right	or	wrong	,	and	at	the	end	i	'll	discuss	experiments	which	,	in	the	next	few	years	,	may	tell	us	whether	it	's	right	or	wrong	--	this	idea	has	had	a	major	impact	on	physics	in	the	last	century	and	continues	to	inform	a	lot	of	cutting	-	edge	research	.
so	,	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	something	about	the	story	of	these	extra	dimensions	.
so	where	do	we	go	?
to	begin	we	need	a	little	bit	of	back	story	.	go	to	1907	.
this	is	a	year	when	einstein	is	basking	in	the	glow	of	having	discovered	the	special	theory	of	relativity	and	decides	to	take	on	a	new	project	,	to	try	to	understand	fully	the	grand	,	pervasive	force	of	gravity	.
and	in	that	moment	,	there	are	many	people	around	who	thought	that	that	project	had	already	been	resolved	.
newton	had	given	the	world	a	theory	of	gravity	in	the	late	1600s	that	works	well	,	describes	the	motion	of	planets	,	the	motion	of	the	moon	and	so	forth	,	the	motion	of	apocryphal	of	apples	falling	from	trees	,	hitting	people	on	the	head	.
all	of	that	could	be	described	using	newton	's	work	.
but	einstein	realized	that	newton	had	left	something	out	of	the	story	,	because	even	newton	had	written	that	although	he	understood	how	to	calculate	the	effect	of	gravity	,	he	'd	been	unable	to	figure	out	how	it	really	works	.
how	is	it	that	the	sun	,	93	million	miles	away	,	[	that	]	somehow	it	affects	the	motion	of	the	earth	?
how	does	the	sun	reach	out	across	empty	inert	space	and	exert	influence	?
and	that	is	a	task	to	which	einstein	set	himself	--	to	figure	out	how	gravity	works	.
and	let	me	show	you	what	it	is	that	he	found	.
so	einstein	found	that	the	medium	that	transmits	gravity	is	space	itself	.
the	idea	goes	like	this	:	imagine	space	is	a	substrate	of	all	there	is	.
einstein	said	space	is	nice	and	flat	,	if	there	's	no	matter	present	.
but	if	there	is	matter	in	the	environment	,	such	as	the	sun	,	it	causes	the	fabric	of	space	to	warp	,	to	curve	.
and	that	communicates	the	force	of	gravity	.
even	the	earth	warps	space	around	it	.
now	look	at	the	moon	.
the	moon	is	kept	in	orbit	,	according	to	these	ideas	,	because	it	rolls	along	a	valley	in	the	curved	environment	that	the	sun	and	the	moon	and	the	earth	can	all	create	by	virtue	of	their	presence	.
we	go	to	a	full	-	frame	view	of	this	.
the	earth	itself	is	kept	in	orbit	because	it	rolls	along	a	valley	in	the	environment	that	's	curved	because	of	the	sun	's	presence	.
that	is	this	new	idea	about	how	gravity	actually	works	.
now	,	this	idea	was	tested	in	1919	through	astronomical	observations	.
it	really	works	.	it	describes	the	data	.
and	this	gained	einstein	prominence	around	the	world	.
and	that	is	what	got	kaluza	thinking	.
he	,	like	einstein	,	was	in	search	of	what	we	call	a	unified	theory	.
that	's	one	theory	that	might	be	able	to	describe	all	of	nature	's	forces	from	one	set	of	ideas	,	one	set	of	principles	,	one	master	equation	,	if	you	will	.
so	kaluza	said	to	himself	,	einstein	has	been	able	to	describe	gravity	in	terms	of	warps	and	curves	in	space	--	in	fact	,	space	and	time	,	to	be	more	precise	.
maybe	i	can	play	the	same	game	with	the	other	known	force	,	which	was	,	at	that	time	,	known	as	the	electromagnetic	force	--	we	know	of	others	today	,	but	at	that	time	that	was	the	only	other	one	people	were	thinking	about	.
you	know	,	the	force	responsible	for	electricity	and	magnetic	attraction	and	so	forth	.
so	kaluza	says	,	maybe	i	can	play	the	same	game	and	describe	electromagnetic	force	in	terms	of	warps	and	curves	.
that	raised	a	question	:	warps	and	curves	in	what	?
einstein	had	already	used	up	space	and	time	,	warps	and	curves	,	to	describe	gravity	.
there	did	n't	seem	to	be	anything	else	to	warp	or	curve	.
so	kaluza	said	,	well	,	maybe	there	are	more	dimensions	of	space	.
he	said	,	if	i	want	to	describe	one	more	force	,	maybe	i	need	one	more	dimension	.
so	he	imagined	that	the	world	had	four	dimensions	of	space	,	not	three	,	and	imagined	that	electromagnetism	was	warps	and	curves	in	that	fourth	dimension	.	now	here	's	the	thing	:	when	he	wrote	down	the	equations	describing	warps	and	curves	in	a	universe	with	four	space	dimensions	,	not	three	,	he	found	the	old	equations	that	einstein	had	already	derived	in	three	dimensions	--	those	were	for	gravity	--	but	he	found	one	more	equation	because	of	the	one	more	dimension	.
and	when	he	looked	at	that	equation	,	it	was	none	other	than	the	equation	that	scientists	had	long	known	to	describe	the	electromagnetic	force	.
amazing	--	it	just	popped	out	.
he	was	so	excited	by	this	realization	that	he	ran	around	his	house	screaming	,	``	victory	!	``	--	that	he	had	found	the	unified	theory	.
now	clearly	,	kaluza	was	a	man	who	took	theory	very	seriously	.
he	,	in	fact	--	there	is	a	story	that	when	he	wanted	to	learn	how	to	swim	,	he	read	a	book	,	a	treatise	on	swimming	--	--	then	dove	into	the	ocean	.
this	is	a	man	who	would	risk	his	life	on	theory	.
now	,	but	for	those	of	us	who	are	a	little	bit	more	practically	minded	,	two	questions	immediately	arise	from	his	observation	.
number	one	:	if	there	are	more	dimensions	in	space	,	where	are	they	?
we	do	n't	seem	to	see	them	.
and	number	two	:	does	this	theory	really	work	in	detail	,	when	you	try	to	apply	it	to	the	world	around	us	?
now	,	the	first	question	was	answered	in	1926	by	a	fellow	named	oskar	klein	.
he	suggested	that	dimensions	might	come	in	two	varieties	--	there	might	be	big	,	easy	-	to	-	see	dimensions	,	but	there	might	also	be	tiny	,	curled	-	up	dimensions	,	curled	up	so	small	,	even	though	they	're	all	around	us	,	that	we	do	n't	see	them	.
let	me	show	you	that	one	visually	.
so	,	imagine	you	're	looking	at	something	like	a	cable	supporting	a	traffic	light	.
it	's	in	manhattan	.	you	're	in	central	park	--	it	's	kind	of	irrelevant	--	but	the	cable	looks	one	-	dimensional	from	a	distant	viewpoint	,	but	you	and	i	all	know	that	it	does	have	some	thickness	.
it	's	very	hard	to	see	it	,	though	,	from	far	away	.
but	if	we	zoom	in	and	take	the	perspective	of	,	say	,	a	little	ant	walking	around	--	little	ants	are	so	small	that	they	can	access	all	of	the	dimensions	--	the	long	dimension	,	but	also	this	clockwise	,	counter	-	clockwise	direction	.
and	i	hope	you	appreciate	this	.
it	took	so	long	to	get	these	ants	to	do	this	.
but	this	illustrates	the	fact	that	dimensions	can	be	of	two	sorts	:	big	and	small	.	and	the	idea	that	maybe	the	big	dimensions	around	us	are	the	ones	that	we	can	easily	see	,	but	there	might	be	additional	dimensions	curled	up	,	sort	of	like	the	circular	part	of	that	cable	,	so	small	that	they	have	so	far	remained	invisible	.
let	me	show	you	what	that	would	look	like	.
so	,	if	we	take	a	look	,	say	,	at	space	itself	--	i	can	only	show	,	of	course	,	two	dimensions	on	a	screen	.
some	of	you	guys	will	fix	that	one	day	,	but	anything	that	's	not	flat	on	a	screen	is	a	new	dimension	,	goes	smaller	,	smaller	,	smaller	,	and	way	down	in	the	microscopic	depths	of	space	itself	,	this	is	the	idea	,	you	could	have	additional	curled	up	dimensions	--	here	is	a	little	shape	of	a	circle	--	so	small	that	we	do	n't	see	them	.
but	if	you	were	a	little	ultra	microscopic	ant	walking	around	,	you	could	walk	in	the	big	dimensions	that	we	all	know	about	--	that	's	like	the	grid	part	--	but	you	could	also	access	the	tiny	curled	-	up	dimension	that	's	so	small	that	we	ca	n't	see	it	with	the	naked	eye	or	even	with	any	of	our	most	refined	equipment	.
but	deeply	tucked	into	the	fabric	of	space	itself	,	the	idea	is	there	could	be	more	dimensions	,	as	we	see	there	.
now	that	's	an	explanation	about	how	the	universe	could	have	more	dimensions	than	the	ones	that	we	see	.
but	what	about	the	second	question	that	i	asked	:	does	the	theory	actually	work	when	you	try	to	apply	it	to	the	real	world	?
well	,	it	turns	out	that	einstein	and	kaluza	and	many	others	worked	on	trying	to	refine	this	framework	and	apply	it	to	the	physics	of	the	universe	as	was	understood	at	the	time	,	and	,	in	detail	,	it	did	n't	work	.
in	detail	,	for	instance	,	they	could	n't	get	the	mass	of	the	electron	to	work	out	correctly	in	this	theory	.
so	many	people	worked	on	it	,	but	by	the	'40s	,	certainly	by	the	'50s	,	this	strange	but	very	compelling	idea	of	how	to	unify	the	laws	of	physics	had	gone	away	.
until	something	wonderful	happened	in	our	age	.
in	our	era	,	a	new	approach	to	unify	the	laws	of	physics	is	being	pursued	by	physicists	such	as	myself	,	many	others	around	the	world	,	it	's	called	superstring	theory	,	as	you	were	indicating	.
and	the	wonderful	thing	is	that	superstring	theory	has	nothing	to	do	at	first	sight	with	this	idea	of	extra	dimensions	,	but	when	we	study	superstring	theory	,	we	find	that	it	resurrects	the	idea	in	a	sparkling	,	new	form	.
so	,	let	me	just	tell	you	how	that	goes	.
superstring	theory	--	what	is	it	?
well	,	it	's	a	theory	that	tries	to	answer	the	question	:	what	are	the	basic	,	fundamental	,	indivisible	,	uncuttable	constituents	making	up	everything	in	the	world	around	us	?
the	idea	is	like	this	.
so	,	imagine	we	look	at	a	familiar	object	,	just	a	candle	in	a	holder	,	and	imagine	that	we	want	to	figure	out	what	it	is	made	of	.
so	we	go	on	a	journey	deep	inside	the	object	and	examine	the	constituents	.
so	deep	inside	--	we	all	know	,	you	go	sufficiently	far	down	,	you	have	atoms	.
we	also	all	know	that	atoms	are	not	the	end	of	the	story	.
they	have	little	electrons	that	swarm	around	a	central	nucleus	with	neutrons	and	protons	.
even	the	neutrons	and	protons	have	smaller	particles	inside	of	them	known	as	quarks	.
that	is	where	conventional	ideas	stop	.
here	is	the	new	idea	of	string	theory	.
deep	inside	any	of	these	particles	,	there	is	something	else	.
this	something	else	is	this	dancing	filament	of	energy	.
it	looks	like	a	vibrating	string	--	that	's	where	the	idea	,	string	theory	comes	from	.
and	just	like	the	vibrating	strings	that	you	just	saw	in	a	cello	can	vibrate	in	different	patterns	,	these	can	also	vibrate	in	different	patterns	.
they	do	n't	produce	different	musical	notes	.
rather	,	they	produce	the	different	particles	making	up	the	world	around	us	.
so	if	these	ideas	are	correct	,	this	is	what	the	ultra	-	microscopic	landscape	of	the	universe	looks	like	.
it	's	built	up	of	a	huge	number	of	these	little	tiny	filaments	of	vibrating	energy	,	vibrating	in	different	frequencies	.
the	different	frequencies	produce	the	different	particles	.
the	different	particles	are	responsible	for	all	the	richness	in	the	world	around	us	.
and	there	you	see	unification	,	because	matter	particles	,	electrons	and	quarks	,	radiation	particles	,	photons	,	gravitons	,	are	all	built	up	from	one	entity	.
so	matter	and	the	forces	of	nature	all	are	put	together	under	the	rubric	of	vibrating	strings	.
and	that	's	what	we	mean	by	a	unified	theory	.
now	here	is	the	catch	.
when	you	study	the	mathematics	of	string	theory	,	you	find	that	it	does	n't	work	in	a	universe	that	just	has	three	dimensions	of	space	.
it	does	n't	work	in	a	universe	with	four	dimensions	of	space	,	nor	five	,	nor	six	.
finally	,	you	can	study	the	equations	,	and	show	that	it	works	only	in	a	universe	that	has	10	dimensions	of	space	and	one	dimension	of	time	.
it	leads	us	right	back	to	this	idea	of	kaluza	and	klein	--	that	our	world	,	when	appropriately	described	,	has	more	dimensions	than	the	ones	that	we	see	.
now	you	might	think	about	that	and	say	,	well	,	ok	,	you	know	,	if	you	have	extra	dimensions	,	and	they	're	really	tightly	curled	up	,	yeah	,	perhaps	we	wo	n't	see	them	,	if	they	're	small	enough	.
but	if	there	's	a	little	tiny	civilization	of	green	people	walking	around	down	there	,	and	you	make	them	small	enough	,	and	we	wo	n't	see	them	either	.	that	is	true	.
one	of	the	other	predictions	of	string	theory	--	no	,	that	's	not	one	of	the	other	predictions	of	string	theory	.
but	it	raises	the	question	:	are	we	just	trying	to	hide	away	these	extra	dimensions	,	or	do	they	tell	us	something	about	the	world	?
in	the	remaining	time	,	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	two	features	of	them	.
first	is	,	many	of	us	believe	that	these	extra	dimensions	hold	the	answer	to	what	perhaps	is	the	deepest	question	in	theoretical	physics	,	theoretical	science	.
and	that	question	is	this	:	when	we	look	around	the	world	,	as	scientists	have	done	for	the	last	hundred	years	,	there	appear	to	be	about	20	numbers	that	really	describe	our	universe	.
these	are	numbers	like	the	mass	of	the	particles	,	like	electrons	and	quarks	,	the	strength	of	gravity	,	the	strength	of	the	electromagnetic	force	--	a	list	of	about	20	numbers	that	have	been	measured	with	incredible	precision	,	but	nobody	has	an	explanation	for	why	the	numbers	have	the	particular	values	that	they	do	.
now	,	does	string	theory	offer	an	answer	?
not	yet	.
but	we	believe	the	answer	for	why	those	numbers	have	the	values	they	do	may	rely	on	the	form	of	the	extra	dimensions	.
and	the	wonderful	thing	is	,	if	those	numbers	had	any	other	values	than	the	known	ones	,	the	universe	,	as	we	know	it	,	would	n't	exist	.
this	is	a	deep	question	.
why	are	those	numbers	so	finely	tuned	to	allow	stars	to	shine	and	planets	to	form	,	when	we	recognize	that	if	you	fiddle	with	those	numbers	--	if	i	had	20	dials	up	here	and	i	let	you	come	up	and	fiddle	with	those	numbers	,	almost	any	fiddling	makes	the	universe	disappear	.
so	can	we	explain	those	20	numbers	?
and	string	theory	suggests	that	those	20	numbers	have	to	do	with	the	extra	dimensions	.
let	me	show	you	how	.
so	when	we	talk	about	the	extra	dimensions	in	string	theory	,	it	's	not	one	extra	dimension	,	as	in	the	older	ideas	of	kaluza	and	klein	.
this	is	what	string	theory	says	about	the	extra	dimensions	.
they	have	a	very	rich	,	intertwined	geometry	.
this	is	an	example	of	something	known	as	a	calabi	-	yau	shape	--	name	is	n't	all	that	important	.
but	,	as	you	can	see	,	the	extra	dimensions	fold	in	on	themselves	and	intertwine	in	a	very	interesting	shape	,	interesting	structure	.
and	the	idea	is	that	if	this	is	what	the	extra	dimensions	look	like	,	then	the	microscopic	landscape	of	our	universe	all	around	us	would	look	like	this	on	the	tiniest	of	scales	.
when	you	swing	your	hand	,	you	'd	be	moving	around	these	extra	dimensions	over	and	over	again	,	but	they	're	so	small	that	we	would	n't	know	it	.
so	what	is	the	physical	implication	,	though	,	relevant	to	those	20	numbers	?
consider	this	.	if	you	look	at	the	instrument	,	a	french	horn	,	notice	that	the	vibrations	of	the	airstreams	are	affected	by	the	shape	of	the	instrument	.
now	in	string	theory	,	all	the	numbers	are	reflections	of	the	way	strings	can	vibrate	.
so	just	as	those	airstreams	are	affected	by	the	twists	and	turns	in	the	instrument	,	strings	themselves	will	be	affected	by	the	vibrational	patterns	in	the	geometry	within	which	they	are	moving	.
so	let	me	bring	some	strings	into	the	story	.
and	if	you	watch	these	little	fellows	vibrating	around	--	they	'll	be	there	in	a	second	--	right	there	,	notice	that	they	way	they	vibrate	is	affected	by	the	geometry	of	the	extra	dimensions	.
so	,	if	we	knew	exactly	what	the	extra	dimensions	look	like	--	we	do	n't	yet	,	but	if	we	did	--	we	should	be	able	to	calculate	the	allowed	notes	,	the	allowed	vibrational	patterns	.
and	if	we	could	calculate	the	allowed	vibrational	patterns	,	we	should	be	able	to	calculate	those	20	numbers	.
and	if	the	answer	that	we	get	from	our	calculations	agrees	with	the	values	of	those	numbers	that	have	been	determined	through	detailed	and	precise	experimentation	,	this	in	many	ways	would	be	the	first	fundamental	explanation	for	why	the	structure	of	the	universe	is	the	way	it	is	.
now	,	the	second	issue	that	i	want	to	finish	up	with	is	:	how	might	we	test	for	these	extra	dimensions	more	directly	?
is	this	just	an	interesting	mathematical	structure	that	might	be	able	to	explain	some	previously	unexplained	features	of	the	world	,	or	can	we	actually	test	for	these	extra	dimensions	?
and	we	think	--	and	this	is	,	i	think	,	very	exciting	--	that	in	the	next	five	years	or	so	we	may	be	able	to	test	for	the	existence	of	these	extra	dimensions	.
here	's	how	it	goes	.	in	cern	,	geneva	,	switzerland	,	a	machine	is	being	built	called	the	large	hadron	collider	.
it	's	a	machine	that	will	send	particles	around	a	tunnel	,	opposite	directions	,	near	the	speed	of	light	.
every	so	often	those	particles	will	be	aimed	at	each	other	,	so	there	's	a	head	-	on	collision	.
the	hope	is	that	if	the	collision	has	enough	energy	,	it	may	eject	some	of	the	debris	from	the	collision	from	our	dimensions	,	forcing	it	to	enter	into	the	other	dimensions	.
how	would	we	know	it	?
well	,	we	'll	measure	the	amount	of	energy	after	the	collision	,	compare	it	to	the	amount	of	energy	before	,	and	if	there	's	less	energy	after	the	collision	than	before	,	this	will	be	evidence	that	the	energy	has	drifted	away	.
and	if	it	drifts	away	in	the	right	pattern	that	we	can	calculate	,	this	will	be	evidence	that	the	extra	dimensions	are	there	.
let	me	show	you	that	idea	visually	.
so	,	imagine	we	have	a	certain	kind	of	particle	called	a	graviton	--	that	's	the	kind	of	debris	we	expect	to	be	ejected	out	,	if	the	extra	dimensions	are	real	.
but	here	's	how	the	experiment	will	go	.
you	take	these	particles	.	you	slam	them	together	.
you	slam	them	together	,	and	if	we	are	right	,	some	of	the	energy	of	that	collision	will	go	into	debris	that	flies	off	into	these	extra	dimensions	.
so	this	is	the	kind	of	experiment	that	we	'll	be	looking	at	in	the	next	five	,	seven	to	10	years	or	so	.
and	if	this	experiment	bears	fruit	,	if	we	see	that	kind	of	particle	ejected	by	noticing	that	there	's	less	energy	in	our	dimensions	than	when	we	began	,	this	will	show	that	the	extra	dimensions	are	real	.
and	to	me	this	is	a	really	remarkable	story	,	and	a	remarkable	opportunity	.	going	back	to	newton	with	absolute	space	--	did	n't	provide	anything	but	an	arena	,	a	stage	in	which	the	events	of	the	universe	take	place	.
einstein	comes	along	and	says	,	well	,	space	and	time	can	warp	and	curve	--	that	's	what	gravity	is	.
and	now	string	theory	comes	along	and	says	,	yes	,	gravity	,	quantum	mechanics	,	electromagnetism	,	all	together	in	one	package	,	but	only	if	the	universe	has	more	dimensions	than	the	ones	that	we	see	.
and	this	is	an	experiment	that	may	test	for	them	in	our	lifetime	.
thank	you	very	much	.
