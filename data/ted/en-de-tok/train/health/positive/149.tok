allison	hunt	:	my	three	minutes	has	n't	started	yet	,	has	it	?
chris	anderson	:	no	,	you	ca	n't	start	the	three	minutes	.
reset	the	three	minutes	,	that	's	just	not	fair	.
ah	:	oh	my	god	,	it	's	harsh	up	here	.
i	mean	i	'm	nervous	enough	as	it	is	.
but	i	am	not	as	nervous	as	i	was	five	weeks	ago	.
five	weeks	ago	i	had	total	hip	replacement	surgery	.
do	you	know	that	surgery	?
electric	saw	,	power	drill	,	totally	disgusting	unless	you	're	david	bolinsky	,	in	which	case	it	's	all	truth	and	beauty	.
sure	david	,	if	it	's	not	your	hip	,	it	's	truth	and	beauty	.
anyway	,	i	did	have	a	really	big	epiphany	around	the	situation	,	so	chris	invited	me	to	tell	you	about	it	.
but	first	you	need	to	know	two	things	about	me	.
just	two	things	.
i	'm	canadian	,	and	i	'm	the	youngest	of	seven	kids	.
now	,	in	canada	,	we	have	that	great	healthcare	system	.
that	means	we	get	our	new	hips	for	free	.
and	being	the	youngest	of	seven	,	i	have	never	been	at	the	front	of	the	line	for	anything	.	ok	?
so	my	hip	had	been	hurting	me	for	years	.
i	finally	went	to	the	doctor	,	which	was	free	.
and	she	referred	me	to	an	orthopedic	surgeon	,	also	free	.
finally	got	to	see	him	after	10	months	of	waiting	--	almost	a	year	.
that	is	what	free	gets	you	.
i	met	the	surgeon	,	and	he	took	some	free	x	-	rays	,	and	i	got	a	good	look	at	them	.	and	you	know	,	even	i	could	tell	my	hip	was	bad	,	and	i	actually	work	in	marketing	.
so	he	said	,	``	allison	,	we	've	got	to	get	you	on	the	table	.
i	'm	going	to	replace	your	hip	--	it	's	about	an	18	-	month	wait	.	``
18	more	months	.
i	'd	already	waited	10	months	,	and	i	had	to	wait	18	more	months	.
you	know	,	it	's	such	a	long	wait	that	i	actually	started	to	even	think	about	it	in	terms	of	teds	.
i	would	n't	have	my	new	hip	for	this	ted	.
i	would	n't	have	my	new	hip	for	tedglobal	in	africa	.
i	would	not	have	my	new	hip	for	ted	2008	.
i	would	still	be	on	my	bad	hip	.	that	was	so	disappointing	.
so	,	i	left	his	office	and	i	was	walking	through	the	hospital	,	and	that	's	when	i	had	my	epiphany	.
this	youngest	of	seven	had	to	get	herself	to	the	front	of	the	line	.
oh	yeah	.
can	i	tell	you	how	un	-	canadian	that	is	?
we	do	not	think	that	way	.
we	do	n't	talk	about	it	.	it	's	not	even	a	consideration	.
in	fact	,	when	we	're	traveling	abroad	,	it	's	how	we	identify	fellow	canadians	.
``	after	you	.	``	``	oh	,	no	,	no	.	after	you	.	``
hey	,	are	you	from	canada	?	``	oh	,	me	too	!	hi	!	``
``	great	!	excellent	!	``
so	no	,	suddenly	i	was	n't	averse	to	butting	any	geezer	off	the	list	.
some	70	-	year	-	old	who	wanted	his	new	hip	so	he	could	be	back	golfing	,	or	gardening	.
no	,	no	.	front	of	the	line	.
so	by	now	i	was	walking	the	lobby	,	and	of	course	,	that	hurt	,	because	of	my	hip	,	and	i	kind	of	needed	a	sign	.
and	i	saw	a	sign	.
in	the	window	of	the	hospital	's	tiny	gift	shop	there	was	a	sign	that	said	,	``	volunteers	needed	.	``	hmm	.
well	,	they	signed	me	up	immediately	.
no	reference	checks	.	none	of	the	usual	background	stuff	,	no	.
they	were	desperate	for	volunteers	because	the	average	age	of	the	volunteer	at	the	hospital	gift	shop	was	75	.
yeah	.	they	needed	some	young	blood	.
so	,	next	thing	you	know	,	i	had	my	bright	blue	volunteer	vest	,	i	had	my	photo	id	,	and	i	was	fully	trained	by	my	89	-	year	-	old	boss	.
i	worked	alone	.
every	friday	morning	i	was	at	the	gift	shop	.
while	ringing	in	hospital	staff	's	tic	tacs	,	i	'd	casually	ask	,	``	what	do	you	do	?	``
then	i	'd	tell	them	,	``	well	,	i	'm	getting	my	hip	replaced	--	in	18	months	.
it	's	gon	na	be	so	great	when	the	pain	stops	.	ow	!	``
all	the	staff	got	to	know	the	plucky	,	young	volunteer	.
my	next	surgeon	's	appointment	was	,	coincidentally	,	right	after	a	shift	at	the	gift	shop	.
so	,	naturally	,	i	had	my	vest	and	my	identification	.
i	draped	them	casually	over	the	chair	in	the	doctor	's	office	.
and	you	know	,	when	he	walked	in	,	i	could	just	tell	that	he	saw	them	.
moments	later	,	i	had	a	surgery	date	just	weeks	away	,	and	a	big	fat	prescription	for	percocet	.
now	,	word	on	the	street	was	that	it	was	actually	my	volunteering	that	got	me	to	the	front	of	the	line	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	'm	not	even	ashamed	of	that	.
two	reasons	.
first	of	all	,	i	am	going	to	take	such	good	care	of	this	new	hip	.
but	also	i	intend	to	stick	with	the	volunteering	,	which	actually	leads	me	to	the	biggest	epiphany	of	them	all	.
even	when	a	canadian	cheats	the	system	,	they	do	it	in	a	way	that	benefits	society	.
