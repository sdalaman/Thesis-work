some	of	the	greatest	innovations	and	developments	in	the	world	often	happen	at	the	intersection	of	two	fields	.
so	tonight	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	about	the	intersection	that	i	'm	most	excited	about	at	this	very	moment	,	which	is	entertainment	and	robotics	.
so	if	we	're	trying	to	make	robots	that	can	be	more	expressive	and	that	can	connect	better	with	us	in	society	,	maybe	we	should	look	to	some	of	the	human	professionals	of	artificial	emotion	and	personality	that	occur	in	the	dramatic	arts	.
i	'm	also	interested	in	creating	new	technologies	for	the	arts	and	to	attract	people	to	science	and	technology	.
some	people	in	the	last	decade	or	two	have	started	creating	artwork	with	technology	.
with	my	new	venture	,	marilyn	monrobot	,	i	would	like	to	use	art	to	create	tech	.
so	we	're	based	in	new	york	city	.
and	if	you	're	a	performer	that	wants	to	collaborate	with	an	adorable	robot	,	or	if	you	have	a	robot	that	needs	entertainment	representation	,	please	contact	me	,	the	bot	-	agent	.
the	bot	,	our	rising	celebrity	,	also	has	his	own	twitter	account	:	@	robotinthewild	.
i	'd	like	to	introduce	you	to	one	of	our	first	robots	,	data	.
he	's	named	after	the	star	trek	character	.
i	think	he	's	going	to	be	super	popular	.
we	've	got	the	robot	--	in	his	head	is	a	database	of	a	lot	of	jokes	.
now	each	of	these	jokes	is	labeled	with	certain	attributes	.
so	it	knows	something	about	the	subject	;	it	knows	about	the	length	.
it	knows	how	much	it	's	moving	.
and	so	it	's	going	to	try	to	watch	your	response	.
i	actually	have	no	idea	what	my	robot	is	going	to	do	today	.
it	can	also	learn	from	you	about	the	quality	of	its	jokes	and	cater	things	,	sort	of	like	netflix	-	style	,	over	longer	-	term	to	different	communities	or	audiences	,	children	versus	adults	,	different	cultures	.
you	can	learn	something	from	the	robot	about	the	community	that	you	're	in	.
and	also	i	can	use	each	one	of	you	as	the	acting	coach	to	our	future	robot	companions	.
some	of	you	in	this	middle	section	--	you	have	red	/	green	paddles	.
if	you	like	what	's	going	on	,	show	the	green	.
if	you	do	n't	like	the	subject	or	the	performance	,	you	can	hold	the	red	.
now	do	n't	be	shy	.
it	's	just	a	robot	.
it	does	n't	have	feelings	...	yet	.
and	the	rest	of	you	,	you	still	count	,	you	still	matter	.
there	's	also	a	microphone	that	's	listening	to	the	aggregate	laughter	and	applause	and	booing	--	i	hope	not	--	to	help	make	some	of	its	next	decisions	.
right	,	so	,	let	the	robot	stand	-	up	comedy	begin	.
data	:	hello	tedwomen	.
it	's	an	honor	to	be	here	.
you	guys	are	looking	good	out	there	.
ready	for	some	jokes	?
data	:	here	's	the	first	one	.
right	,	so	,	a	doctor	says	to	his	patient	,	``	i	have	bad	news	and	worse	news	.
the	bad	news	is	that	you	only	have	24	hours	to	live	.	``
``	that	's	terrible	,	``	said	the	patient	.
``	how	can	the	news	possibly	be	worse	?	``
``	i	've	been	trying	to	contact	you	since	yesterday	.	``
the	swiss	have	an	interesting	army	.	five	hundred	years	without	a	war	.
heather	knight	:	he	's	talking	about	the	swiss	.
data	:	pretty	lucky	for	them	.
ever	see	that	little	swiss	army	knife	they	have	to	fight	with	?
``	come	on	buddy	,	i	have	the	toe	clippers	right	here	.
you	get	past	me	,	the	guy	behind	me	has	a	spoon	.	``
hk	:	he	's	a	french	robot	.
data	:	a	couple	of	new	jersey	hunters	are	out	in	the	woods	.
one	of	them	falls	to	the	ground	.
he	does	not	seem	to	be	breathing	.
the	other	guy	whips	out	his	cell	phone	and	calls	911	.
he	gasps	to	the	operator	,	``	my	friend	is	dead	.
what	can	i	do	?	``
the	operator	says	,	``	just	take	it	easy	.
i	can	help	.
first	,	let	's	make	sure	he	's	dead	.	``
there	is	a	silence	,	and	the	operator	hears	a	shot	.
the	guy	's	voice	comes	back	on	the	line	,	``	okay	,	now	what	?	``
question	:	why	is	television	called	a	medium	?
anyone	?
because	it	's	neither	rare	nor	well	done	.
but	to	be	completely	honest	with	you	,	i	kind	of	love	television	.
any	of	you	like	television	?	audience	:	yes	.
data	:	i	find	it	incredibly	educational	.
actually	,	as	soon	as	someone	turns	it	on	,	i	go	into	the	other	room	and	read	.
that	's	all	for	now	.
was	that	okay	for	my	first	time	?
you	've	been	a	great	audience	.
thank	you	.
hk	:	yay	.
so	this	is	actually	the	first	time	we	've	ever	done	live	audience	feedback	to	a	performance	.
so	thank	you	all	for	being	a	part	of	it	.
there	's	a	lot	more	to	come	.
and	we	hope	to	learn	a	lot	about	robot	expression	.
thank	you	very	much	.
