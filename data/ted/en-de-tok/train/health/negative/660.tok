over	the	next	five	minutes	,	my	intention	is	to	transform	your	relationship	with	sound	.
let	me	start	with	the	observation	that	most	of	the	sound	around	us	is	accidental	,	and	much	of	it	is	unpleasant	.
we	stand	on	street	corners	,	shouting	over	noise	like	this	,	and	pretending	that	it	does	n't	exist	.
well	,	this	habit	of	suppressing	sound	has	meant	that	our	relationship	with	sound	has	become	largely	unconscious	.
there	are	four	major	ways	sound	is	affecting	you	all	the	time	,	and	i	'd	like	to	raise	them	in	your	consciousness	today	.
first	is	physiological	.
sorry	about	that	.	i	've	just	given	you	a	shot	of	cortisol	,	your	fight	/	flight	hormone	.
sounds	are	affecting	your	hormone	secretions	all	the	time	,	but	also	your	breathing	,	your	heart	rate	--	which	i	just	also	did	--	and	your	brainwaves	.
it	's	not	just	unpleasant	sounds	like	that	that	do	it	.
this	is	surf	.
it	has	the	frequency	of	roughly	12	cycles	per	minute	.
most	people	find	that	very	soothing	,	and	,	interestingly	,	12	cycles	per	minute	is	roughly	the	frequency	of	the	breathing	of	a	sleeping	human	.
there	is	a	deep	resonance	with	being	at	rest	.
we	also	associate	it	with	being	stress	-	free	and	on	holiday	.
the	second	way	in	which	sound	affects	you	is	psychological	.
music	is	the	most	powerful	form	of	sound	that	we	know	that	affects	our	emotional	state	.
this	is	guaranteed	to	make	most	of	you	feel	pretty	sad	if	i	leave	it	on	.
music	is	not	the	only	kind	of	sound	,	however	,	which	affects	your	emotions	.
natural	sound	can	do	that	too	.
birdsong	,	for	example	,	is	a	sound	which	most	people	find	reassuring	.
there	is	a	reason	for	that	.	over	hundreds	of	thousands	of	years	we	've	learned	that	when	the	birds	are	singing	,	things	are	safe	.
it	's	when	they	stop	you	need	to	be	worried	.
the	third	way	in	which	sound	affects	you	is	cognitively	.
you	ca	n't	understand	two	people	talking	at	once	or	in	this	case	one	person	talking	twice	.
try	and	listen	to	the	other	one	.
we	have	a	very	small	amount	of	bandwidth	for	processing	auditory	input	,	which	is	why	noise	like	this	--	--	is	extremely	damaging	for	productivity	.
if	you	have	to	work	in	an	open	-	plan	office	like	this	,	your	productivity	is	greatly	reduced	.
and	whatever	number	you	're	thinking	of	,	it	probably	is	n't	as	bad	as	this	.
you	are	one	third	as	productive	in	open	-	plan	offices	as	in	quiet	rooms	.
and	i	have	a	tip	for	you	.	if	you	have	to	work	in	spaces	like	that	,	carry	headphones	with	you	,	with	a	soothing	sound	like	birdsong	.
put	them	on	and	your	productivity	goes	back	up	to	triple	what	it	would	be	.
the	fourth	way	in	which	sound	affects	us	is	behaviorally	.
with	all	that	other	stuff	going	on	,	it	would	be	amazing	if	our	behavior	did	n't	change	.
so	,	ask	yourself	:	is	this	person	ever	going	to	drive	at	a	steady	28	miles	per	hour	?	i	do	n't	think	so	.
at	the	simplest	,	you	move	away	from	unpleasant	sound	and	towards	pleasant	sounds	.
so	if	i	were	to	play	this	--	--	for	more	than	a	few	seconds	,	you	'd	feel	uncomfortable	;	for	more	than	a	few	minutes	,	you	'd	be	leaving	the	room	in	droves	.
for	people	who	ca	n't	get	away	from	noise	like	that	,	it	's	extremely	damaging	for	their	health	.
and	that	's	not	the	only	thing	that	bad	sound	damages	.
most	retail	sound	is	inappropriate	and	accidental	,	and	even	hostile	,	and	it	has	a	dramatic	effect	on	sales	.
for	those	of	you	who	are	retailers	,	you	may	want	to	look	away	before	i	show	this	slide	.
they	are	losing	up	to	30	percent	of	their	business	with	people	leaving	shops	faster	,	or	just	turning	around	on	the	door	.
we	all	have	done	it	,	leaving	the	area	because	the	sound	in	there	is	so	dreadful	.
i	want	to	spend	just	a	moment	talking	about	the	model	that	we	've	developed	,	which	allows	us	to	start	at	the	top	and	look	at	the	drivers	of	sound	,	analyze	the	soundscape	and	then	predict	the	four	outcomes	i	've	just	talked	about	.
or	start	at	the	bottom	,	and	say	what	outcomes	do	we	want	,	and	then	design	a	soundscape	to	have	a	desired	effect	.
at	last	we	've	got	some	science	we	can	apply	.
and	we	're	in	the	business	of	designing	soundscapes	.
just	a	word	on	music	.	music	is	the	most	powerful	sound	there	is	,	often	inappropriately	deployed	.
it	's	powerful	for	two	reasons	.	you	recognize	it	fast	,	and	you	associate	it	very	powerfully	.
i	'll	give	you	two	examples	.
most	of	you	recognize	that	immediately	.
the	younger	,	maybe	not	.
and	most	of	you	associate	that	with	something	!
now	,	those	are	one	-	second	samples	of	music	.
music	is	very	powerful	.	and	unfortunately	it	's	veneering	commercial	spaces	,	often	inappropriately	.
i	hope	that	's	going	to	change	over	the	next	few	years	.
let	me	just	talk	about	brands	for	a	moment	,	because	some	of	you	run	brands	.	every	brand	is	out	there	making	sound	right	now	.
there	are	eight	expressions	of	a	brand	in	sound	.
they	are	all	important	.	and	every	brand	needs	to	have	guidelines	at	the	center	.
i	'm	glad	to	say	that	is	starting	to	happen	now	.
you	all	recognize	that	one	.	this	is	the	most	-	played	tune	in	the	world	today	.
1.8	billion	times	a	day	,	that	tune	is	played	.
and	it	cost	nokia	absolutely	nothing	.
just	leave	you	with	four	golden	rules	,	for	those	of	you	who	run	businesses	,	for	commercial	sound	.
first	,	make	it	congruent	,	pointing	in	the	same	direction	as	your	visual	communication	.
that	increases	impact	by	over	1,100	percent	.
if	your	sound	is	pointing	the	opposite	direction	,	incongruent	,	you	reduce	impact	by	86	percent	.
that	's	an	order	of	magnitude	,	up	or	down	.
this	is	important	.
secondly	,	make	it	appropriate	to	the	situation	.
thirdly	,	make	it	valuable	.	give	people	something	with	the	sound	.
do	n't	just	bombard	them	with	stuff	.
and	,	finally	,	test	and	test	it	again	.
sound	is	complex	.	there	are	many	countervailing	influences	.
it	can	be	a	bit	like	a	bowl	of	spaghetti	:	sometimes	you	just	have	to	eat	it	and	see	what	happens	.
so	i	hope	this	talk	has	raised	sound	in	your	consciousness	.
if	you	're	listening	consciously	,	you	can	take	control	of	the	sound	around	you	.
it	's	good	for	your	health	.	it	's	good	for	your	productivity	.
if	we	all	do	that	we	move	to	a	state	that	i	like	to	think	will	be	sound	living	in	the	world	.
i	'm	going	to	leave	you	with	a	little	bit	more	birdsong	.
i	recommend	at	least	five	minutes	a	day	,	but	there	is	no	maximum	dose	.
thank	you	for	lending	me	your	ears	today	.
