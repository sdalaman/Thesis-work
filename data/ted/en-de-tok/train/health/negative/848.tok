how	do	you	explain	when	things	do	n't	go	as	we	assume	?
or	better	,	how	do	you	explain	when	others	are	able	to	achieve	things	that	seem	to	defy	all	of	the	assumptions	?
for	example	:	why	is	apple	so	innovative	?
year	after	year	,	after	year	,	after	year	,	they	're	more	innovative	than	all	their	competition	.
and	yet	,	they	're	just	a	computer	company	.
they	're	just	like	everyone	else	.
they	have	the	same	access	to	the	same	talent	,	the	same	agencies	,	the	same	consultants	,	the	same	media	.
then	why	is	it	that	they	seem	to	have	something	different	?
why	is	it	that	martin	luther	king	led	the	civil	rights	movement	?
he	was	n't	the	only	man	who	suffered	in	a	pre	-	civil	rights	america	,	and	he	certainly	was	n't	the	only	great	orator	of	the	day	.
why	him	?
and	why	is	it	that	the	wright	brothers	were	able	to	figure	out	controlled	,	powered	man	flight	when	there	were	certainly	other	teams	who	were	better	qualified	,	better	funded	...
and	they	did	n't	achieve	powered	man	flight	,	and	the	wright	brothers	beat	them	to	it	.
there	's	something	else	at	play	here	.
about	three	and	a	half	years	ago	i	made	a	discovery	.
and	this	discovery	profoundly	changed	my	view	on	how	i	thought	the	world	worked	,	and	it	even	profoundly	changed	the	way	in	which	i	operate	in	it	.
as	it	turns	out	,	there	's	a	pattern	.
as	it	turns	out	,	all	the	great	and	inspiring	leaders	and	organizations	in	the	world	--	whether	it	's	apple	or	martin	luther	king	or	the	wright	brothers	--	they	all	think	,	act	and	communicate	the	exact	same	way	.
and	it	's	the	complete	opposite	to	everyone	else	.
all	i	did	was	codify	it	,	and	it	's	probably	the	world	's	simplest	idea	.
i	call	it	the	golden	circle	.
why	?	how	?	what	?
this	little	idea	explains	why	some	organizations	and	some	leaders	are	able	to	inspire	where	others	are	n't	.
let	me	define	the	terms	really	quickly	.
every	single	person	,	every	single	organization	on	the	planet	knows	what	they	do	,	100	percent	.
some	know	how	they	do	it	,	whether	you	call	it	your	differentiated	value	proposition	or	your	proprietary	process	or	your	usp	.
but	very	,	very	few	people	or	organizations	know	why	they	do	what	they	do	.
and	by	``	why	``	i	do	n't	mean	``	to	make	a	profit	.	``
that	's	a	result	.	it	's	always	a	result	.
by	``	why	,	``	i	mean	:	what	's	your	purpose	?
what	's	your	cause	?	what	's	your	belief	?
why	does	your	organization	exist	?
why	do	you	get	out	of	bed	in	the	morning	?
and	why	should	anyone	care	?
well	,	as	a	result	,	the	way	we	think	,	the	way	we	act	,	the	way	we	communicate	is	from	the	outside	in	.
it	's	obvious	.	we	go	from	the	clearest	thing	to	the	fuzziest	thing	.
but	the	inspired	leaders	and	the	inspired	organizations	--	regardless	of	their	size	,	regardless	of	their	industry	--	all	think	,	act	and	communicate	from	the	inside	out	.
let	me	give	you	an	example	.
i	use	apple	because	they	're	easy	to	understand	and	everybody	gets	it	.
if	apple	were	like	everyone	else	,	a	marketing	message	from	them	might	sound	like	this	:	``	we	make	great	computers	.
they	're	beautifully	designed	,	simple	to	use	and	user	friendly	.
want	to	buy	one	?	``	``	meh	.	``
and	that	's	how	most	of	us	communicate	.
that	's	how	most	marketing	is	done	,	that	's	how	most	sales	is	done	and	that	's	how	most	of	us	communicate	interpersonally	.
we	say	what	we	do	,	we	say	how	we	're	different	or	how	we	're	better	and	we	expect	some	sort	of	a	behavior	,	a	purchase	,	a	vote	,	something	like	that	.
here	's	our	new	law	firm	:	we	have	the	best	lawyers	with	the	biggest	clients	,	we	always	perform	for	our	clients	who	do	business	with	us	.
here	's	our	new	car	:	it	gets	great	gas	mileage	,	it	has	leather	seats	,	buy	our	car	.
but	it	's	uninspiring	.
here	's	how	apple	actually	communicates	.
``	everything	we	do	,	we	believe	in	challenging	the	status	quo	.
we	believe	in	thinking	differently	.
the	way	we	challenge	the	status	quo	is	by	making	our	products	beautifully	designed	,	simple	to	use	and	user	friendly	.
we	just	happen	to	make	great	computers	.
want	to	buy	one	?	``
totally	different	right	?	you	're	ready	to	buy	a	computer	from	me	.
all	i	did	was	reverse	the	order	of	the	information	.
what	it	proves	to	us	is	that	people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	people	buy	why	you	do	it	.
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	.
this	explains	why	every	single	person	in	this	room	is	perfectly	comfortable	buying	a	computer	from	apple	.
but	we	're	also	perfectly	comfortable	buying	an	mp	3	player	from	apple	,	or	a	phone	from	apple	,	or	a	dvr	from	apple	.
but	,	as	i	said	before	,	apple	's	just	a	computer	company	.
there	's	nothing	that	distinguishes	them	structurally	from	any	of	their	competitors	.
their	competitors	are	all	equally	qualified	to	make	all	of	these	products	.
in	fact	,	they	tried	.
a	few	years	ago	,	gateway	came	out	with	flat	screen	tvs	.
they	're	eminently	qualified	to	make	flat	screen	tvs	.
they	've	been	making	flat	screen	monitors	for	years	.
nobody	bought	one	.
dell	came	out	with	mp	3	players	and	pdas	,	and	they	make	great	quality	products	,	and	they	can	make	perfectly	well	-	designed	products	--	and	nobody	bought	one	.
in	fact	,	talking	about	it	now	,	we	ca	n't	even	imagine	buying	an	mp	3	player	from	dell	.
why	would	you	buy	an	mp	3	player	from	a	computer	company	?
but	we	do	it	every	day	.
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	.
the	goal	is	not	to	do	business	with	everybody	who	needs	what	you	have	.
the	goal	is	to	do	business	with	people	who	believe	what	you	believe	.
here	's	the	best	part	:	none	of	what	i	'm	telling	you	is	my	opinion	.
it	's	all	grounded	in	the	tenets	of	biology	.
not	psychology	,	biology	.
if	you	look	at	a	cross	-	section	of	the	human	brain	,	looking	from	the	top	down	,	what	you	see	is	the	human	brain	is	actually	broken	into	three	major	components	that	correlate	perfectly	with	the	golden	circle	.
our	newest	brain	,	our	homo	sapien	brain	,	our	neocortex	,	corresponds	with	the	``	what	``	level	.
the	neocortex	is	responsible	for	all	of	our	rational	and	analytical	thought	and	language	.
the	middle	two	sections	make	up	our	limbic	brains	,	and	our	limbic	brains	are	responsible	for	all	of	our	feelings	,	like	trust	and	loyalty	.
it	's	also	responsible	for	all	human	behavior	,	all	decision	-	making	,	and	it	has	no	capacity	for	language	.
in	other	words	,	when	we	communicate	from	the	outside	in	,	yes	,	people	can	understand	vast	amounts	of	complicated	information	like	features	and	benefits	and	facts	and	figures	.
it	just	does	n't	drive	behavior	.
when	we	can	communicate	from	the	inside	out	,	we	're	talking	directly	to	the	part	of	the	brain	that	controls	behavior	,	and	then	we	allow	people	to	rationalize	it	with	the	tangible	things	we	say	and	do	.
this	is	where	gut	decisions	come	from	.
you	know	,	sometimes	you	can	give	somebody	all	the	facts	and	figures	,	and	they	say	,	``	i	know	what	all	the	facts	and	details	say	,	but	it	just	does	n't	feel	right	.	``
why	would	we	use	that	verb	,	it	does	n't	``	feel	``	right	?
because	the	part	of	the	brain	that	controls	decision	-	making	does	n't	control	language	.
and	the	best	we	can	muster	up	is	,	``	i	do	n't	know	.	it	just	does	n't	feel	right	.	``
or	sometimes	you	say	you	're	leading	with	your	heart	,	or	you	're	leading	with	your	soul	.
well	,	i	hate	to	break	it	to	you	,	those	are	n't	other	body	parts	controlling	your	behavior	.
it	's	all	happening	here	in	your	limbic	brain	,	the	part	of	the	brain	that	controls	decision	-	making	and	not	language	.
but	if	you	do	n't	know	why	you	do	what	you	do	,	and	people	respond	to	why	you	do	what	you	do	,	then	how	will	you	ever	get	people	to	vote	for	you	,	or	buy	something	from	you	,	or	,	more	importantly	,	be	loyal	and	want	to	be	a	part	of	what	it	is	that	you	do	.
again	,	the	goal	is	not	just	to	sell	to	people	who	need	what	you	have	;	the	goal	is	to	sell	to	people	who	believe	what	you	believe	.
the	goal	is	not	just	to	hire	people	who	need	a	job	;	it	's	to	hire	people	who	believe	what	you	believe	.
i	always	say	that	,	you	know	,	if	you	hire	people	just	because	they	can	do	a	job	,	they	'll	work	for	your	money	,	but	if	you	hire	people	who	believe	what	you	believe	,	they	'll	work	for	you	with	blood	and	sweat	and	tears	.
and	nowhere	else	is	there	a	better	example	of	this	than	with	the	wright	brothers	.
most	people	do	n't	know	about	samuel	pierpont	langley	.
and	back	in	the	early	20th	century	,	the	pursuit	of	powered	man	flight	was	like	the	dot	com	of	the	day	.
everybody	was	trying	it	.
and	samuel	pierpont	langley	had	,	what	we	assume	,	to	be	the	recipe	for	success	.
i	mean	,	even	now	,	you	ask	people	,	``	why	did	your	product	or	why	did	your	company	fail	?	``
and	people	always	give	you	the	same	permutation	of	the	same	three	things	:	under	-	capitalized	,	the	wrong	people	,	bad	market	conditions	.
it	's	always	the	same	three	things	,	so	let	's	explore	that	.
samuel	pierpont	langley	was	given	50,000	dollars	by	the	war	department	to	figure	out	this	flying	machine	.
money	was	no	problem	.
he	held	a	seat	at	harvard	and	worked	at	the	smithsonian	and	was	extremely	well	-	connected	;	he	knew	all	the	big	minds	of	the	day	.
he	hired	the	best	minds	money	could	find	and	the	market	conditions	were	fantastic	.
the	new	york	times	followed	him	around	everywhere	,	and	everyone	was	rooting	for	langley	.
then	how	come	we	've	never	heard	of	samuel	pierpont	langley	?
a	few	hundred	miles	away	in	dayton	ohio	,	orville	and	wilbur	wright	,	they	had	none	of	what	we	consider	to	be	the	recipe	for	success	.
they	had	no	money	;	they	paid	for	their	dream	with	the	proceeds	from	their	bicycle	shop	;	not	a	single	person	on	the	wright	brothers	'	team	had	a	college	education	,	not	even	orville	or	wilbur	;	and	the	new	york	times	followed	them	around	nowhere	.
the	difference	was	,	orville	and	wilbur	were	driven	by	a	cause	,	by	a	purpose	,	by	a	belief	.
they	believed	that	if	they	could	figure	out	this	flying	machine	,	it	'll	change	the	course	of	the	world	.
samuel	pierpont	langley	was	different	.
he	wanted	to	be	rich	,	and	he	wanted	to	be	famous	.
he	was	in	pursuit	of	the	result	.
he	was	in	pursuit	of	the	riches	.
and	lo	and	behold	,	look	what	happened	.
the	people	who	believed	in	the	wright	brothers	'	dream	worked	with	them	with	blood	and	sweat	and	tears	.
the	others	just	worked	for	the	paycheck	.
and	they	tell	stories	of	how	every	time	the	wright	brothers	went	out	,	they	would	have	to	take	five	sets	of	parts	,	because	that	's	how	many	times	they	would	crash	before	they	came	in	for	supper	.
and	,	eventually	,	on	december	17th	,	1903	,	the	wright	brothers	took	flight	,	and	no	one	was	there	to	even	experience	it	.
we	found	out	about	it	a	few	days	later	.
and	further	proof	that	langley	was	motivated	by	the	wrong	thing	:	the	day	the	wright	brothers	took	flight	,	he	quit	.
he	could	have	said	,	``	that	's	an	amazing	discovery	,	guys	,	and	i	will	improve	upon	your	technology	,	``	but	he	did	n't	.
he	was	n't	first	,	he	did	n't	get	rich	,	he	did	n't	get	famous	so	he	quit	.
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	.
and	if	you	talk	about	what	you	believe	,	you	will	attract	those	who	believe	what	you	believe	.
but	why	is	it	important	to	attract	those	who	believe	what	you	believe	?
something	called	the	law	of	diffusion	of	innovation	,	and	if	you	do	n't	know	the	law	,	you	definitely	know	the	terminology	.
the	first	two	and	a	half	percent	of	our	population	are	our	innovators	.
the	next	13	and	a	half	percent	of	our	population	are	our	early	adopters	.
the	next	34	percent	are	your	early	majority	,	your	late	majority	and	your	laggards	.
the	only	reason	these	people	buy	touch	tone	phones	is	because	you	ca	n't	buy	rotary	phones	anymore	.
we	all	sit	at	various	places	at	various	times	on	this	scale	,	but	what	the	law	of	diffusion	of	innovation	tells	us	is	that	if	you	want	mass	-	market	success	or	mass	-	market	acceptance	of	an	idea	,	you	can	not	have	it	until	you	achieve	this	tipping	point	between	15	and	18	percent	market	penetration	,	and	then	the	system	tips	.
and	i	love	asking	businesses	,	``	what	's	your	conversion	on	new	business	?	``
and	they	love	to	tell	you	,	``	oh	,	it	's	about	10	percent	,	``	proudly	.
well	,	you	can	trip	over	10	percent	of	the	customers	.
we	all	have	about	10	percent	who	just	``	get	it	.	``
that	's	how	we	describe	them	,	right	?
that	's	like	that	gut	feeling	,	``	oh	,	they	just	get	it	.	``
the	problem	is	:	how	do	you	find	the	ones	that	get	it	before	you	're	doing	business	with	them	versus	the	ones	who	do	n't	get	it	?
so	it	's	this	here	,	this	little	gap	that	you	have	to	close	,	as	jeffrey	moore	calls	it	,	``	crossing	the	chasm	``	--	because	,	you	see	,	the	early	majority	will	not	try	something	until	someone	else	has	tried	it	first	.
and	these	guys	,	the	innovators	and	the	early	adopters	,	they	're	comfortable	making	those	gut	decisions	.
they	're	more	comfortable	making	those	intuitive	decisions	that	are	driven	by	what	they	believe	about	the	world	and	not	just	what	product	is	available	.
these	are	the	people	who	stood	in	line	for	six	hours	to	buy	an	iphone	when	they	first	came	out	,	when	you	could	have	just	walked	into	the	store	the	next	week	and	bought	one	off	the	shelf	.
these	are	the	people	who	spent	40,000	dollars	on	flat	screen	tvs	when	they	first	came	out	,	even	though	the	technology	was	substandard	.
and	,	by	the	way	,	they	did	n't	do	it	because	the	technology	was	so	great	;	they	did	it	for	themselves	.
it	's	because	they	wanted	to	be	first	.
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	and	what	you	do	simply	proves	what	you	believe	.
in	fact	,	people	will	do	the	things	that	prove	what	they	believe	.
the	reason	that	person	bought	the	iphone	in	the	first	six	hours	,	stood	in	line	for	six	hours	,	was	because	of	what	they	believed	about	the	world	,	and	how	they	wanted	everybody	to	see	them	:	they	were	first	.
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	.
so	let	me	give	you	a	famous	example	,	a	famous	failure	and	a	famous	success	of	the	law	of	diffusion	of	innovation	.
first	,	the	famous	failure	.
it	's	a	commercial	example	.
as	we	said	before	,	a	second	ago	,	the	recipe	for	success	is	money	and	the	right	people	and	the	right	market	conditions	,	right	?	you	should	have	success	then	.
look	at	tivo	.
from	the	time	tivo	came	out	about	eight	or	nine	years	ago	to	this	current	day	,	they	are	the	single	highest	-	quality	product	on	the	market	,	hands	down	,	there	is	no	dispute	.
they	were	extremely	well	-	funded	.
market	conditions	were	fantastic	.
i	mean	,	we	use	tivo	as	verb	.
i	tivo	stuff	on	my	piece	of	junk	time	warner	dvr	all	the	time	.
but	tivo	's	a	commercial	failure	.
they	've	never	made	money	.
and	when	they	went	ipo	,	their	stock	was	at	about	30	or	40	dollars	and	then	plummeted	,	and	it	's	never	traded	above	10	.
in	fact	,	i	do	n't	think	it	's	even	traded	above	six	,	except	for	a	couple	of	little	spikes	.
because	you	see	,	when	tivo	launched	their	product	they	told	us	all	what	they	had	.
they	said	,	``	we	have	a	product	that	pauses	live	tv	,	skips	commercials	,	rewinds	live	tv	and	memorizes	your	viewing	habits	without	you	even	asking	.	``
and	the	cynical	majority	said	,	``	we	do	n't	believe	you	.
we	do	n't	need	it	.	we	do	n't	like	it	.
you	're	scaring	us	.	``
what	if	they	had	said	,	``	if	you	're	the	kind	of	person	who	likes	to	have	total	control	over	every	aspect	of	your	life	,	boy	,	do	we	have	a	product	for	you	.
it	pauses	live	tv	,	skips	commercials	,	memorizes	your	viewing	habits	,	etc	.	,	etc.	``
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	,	and	what	you	do	simply	serves	as	the	proof	of	what	you	believe	.
now	let	me	give	you	a	successful	example	of	the	law	of	diffusion	of	innovation	.
in	the	summer	of	1963	,	250,000	people	showed	up	on	the	mall	in	washington	to	hear	dr.	king	speak	.
they	sent	out	no	invitations	,	and	there	was	no	website	to	check	the	date	.
how	do	you	do	that	?
well	,	dr.	king	was	n't	the	only	man	in	america	who	was	a	great	orator	.
he	was	n't	the	only	man	in	america	who	suffered	in	a	pre	-	civil	rights	america	.
in	fact	,	some	of	his	ideas	were	bad	.
but	he	had	a	gift	.
he	did	n't	go	around	telling	people	what	needed	to	change	in	america	.
he	went	around	and	told	people	what	he	believed	.
``	i	believe	,	i	believe	,	i	believe	,	``	he	told	people	.
and	people	who	believed	what	he	believed	took	his	cause	,	and	they	made	it	their	own	,	and	they	told	people	.
and	some	of	those	people	created	structures	to	get	the	word	out	to	even	more	people	.
and	lo	and	behold	,	250,000	people	showed	up	on	the	right	day	at	the	right	time	to	hear	him	speak	.
how	many	of	them	showed	up	for	him	?
zero	.
they	showed	up	for	themselves	.
it	's	what	they	believed	about	america	that	got	them	to	travel	in	a	bus	for	eight	hours	to	stand	in	the	sun	in	washington	in	the	middle	of	august	.
it	's	what	they	believed	,	and	it	was	n't	about	black	versus	white	:	25	percent	of	the	audience	was	white	.
dr.	king	believed	that	there	are	two	types	of	laws	in	this	world	:	those	that	are	made	by	a	higher	authority	and	those	that	are	made	by	man	.
and	not	until	all	the	laws	that	are	made	by	man	are	consistent	with	the	laws	that	are	made	by	the	higher	authority	will	we	live	in	a	just	world	.
it	just	so	happened	that	the	civil	rights	movement	was	the	perfect	thing	to	help	him	bring	his	cause	to	life	.
we	followed	,	not	for	him	,	but	for	ourselves	.
and	,	by	the	way	,	he	gave	the	``	i	have	a	dream	``	speech	,	not	the	``	i	have	a	plan	``	speech	.
listen	to	politicians	now	,	with	their	comprehensive	12	-	point	plans	.
they	're	not	inspiring	anybody	.
because	there	are	leaders	and	there	are	those	who	lead	.
leaders	hold	a	position	of	power	or	authority	,	but	those	who	lead	inspire	us	.
whether	they	're	individuals	or	organizations	,	we	follow	those	who	lead	,	not	because	we	have	to	,	but	because	we	want	to	.
we	follow	those	who	lead	,	not	for	them	,	but	for	ourselves	.
and	it	's	those	who	start	with	``	why	``	that	have	the	ability	to	inspire	those	around	them	or	find	others	who	inspire	them	.
thank	you	very	much	.
