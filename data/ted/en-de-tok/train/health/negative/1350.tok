what	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	today	is	some	of	the	problems	that	the	military	of	the	western	world	--	australia	,	united	states	,	u.k.	and	so	on	--	face	in	some	of	the	deployments	that	they	're	dealing	with	in	the	modern	world	at	this	time	.
if	you	think	about	the	sorts	of	things	that	we	've	sent	australian	military	personnel	to	in	recent	years	,	we	've	got	obvious	things	like	iraq	and	afghanistan	,	but	you	've	also	got	things	like	east	timor	and	the	solomon	islands	and	so	on	.
and	a	lot	of	these	deployments	that	we	're	actually	sending	military	personnel	to	these	days	are	n't	traditional	wars	.
in	fact	,	a	lot	of	the	jobs	that	we	're	asking	the	military	personnel	to	do	in	these	situations	are	ones	that	,	in	their	own	countries	,	in	australia	,	the	united	states	and	so	on	,	would	actually	be	done	by	police	officers	.
and	so	there	's	a	bunch	of	problems	that	come	up	for	military	personnel	in	these	situations	,	because	they	're	doing	things	that	they	have	n't	really	been	trained	for	,	and	they	're	doing	things	that	those	who	do	them	in	their	own	countries	are	trained	very	differently	for	and	equipped	very	differently	for	.
now	there	's	a	bunch	of	reasons	why	we	actually	do	send	military	personnel	rather	than	police	to	do	these	jobs	.
if	australia	had	to	send	a	thousand	people	tomorrow	to	west	papua	for	example	,	we	do	n't	have	a	thousand	police	officers	hanging	around	that	could	just	go	tomorrow	and	we	do	have	a	thousand	soldiers	that	could	go	.
so	when	we	have	to	send	someone	,	we	send	the	military	--	because	they	're	there	,	they	're	available	and	,	heck	,	they	're	used	to	going	off	and	doing	these	things	and	living	by	themselves	and	not	having	all	this	extra	support	.
so	they	are	able	to	do	it	in	that	sense	.
but	they	are	n't	trained	in	the	same	way	that	police	officers	are	and	they	're	certainly	not	equipped	in	the	same	way	police	officers	are	.
and	so	this	has	raised	a	bunch	of	problems	for	them	when	dealing	with	these	sorts	of	issues	.
one	particular	thing	that	's	come	up	that	i	am	especially	interested	in	is	the	question	of	whether	,	when	we	're	sending	military	personnel	to	do	these	sorts	of	jobs	,	we	ought	to	be	equipping	them	differently	,	and	in	particular	,	whether	we	ought	to	be	giving	them	access	to	some	of	the	sorts	of	non	-	lethal	weapons	that	police	have	.
since	they	're	doing	some	of	these	same	jobs	,	maybe	they	should	have	some	of	those	things	.
and	of	course	,	there	's	a	range	of	places	where	you	'd	think	those	things	would	be	really	useful	.
so	for	example	,	when	you	've	got	military	checkpoints	.
if	people	are	approaching	these	checkpoints	and	the	military	personnel	there	are	unsure	whether	this	person	's	hostile	or	not	.
say	this	person	approaching	here	,	and	they	say	,	``	well	is	this	a	suicide	bomber	or	not	?
have	they	got	something	hidden	under	their	clothing	?	what	's	going	to	happen	?	``
they	do	n't	know	whether	this	person	's	hostile	or	not	.
if	this	person	does	n't	follow	directions	,	then	they	may	end	up	shooting	them	and	then	find	out	afterward	either	,	yes	,	we	shot	the	right	person	,	or	,	no	,	this	was	just	an	innocent	person	who	did	n't	understand	what	was	going	on	.
so	if	they	had	non	-	lethal	weapons	then	they	would	say	,	``	well	we	can	use	them	in	that	sort	of	situation	.
if	we	shoot	someone	who	was	n't	hostile	,	at	least	we	have	n't	killed	them	.	``
another	situation	.
this	photo	is	actually	from	one	of	the	missions	in	the	balkans	in	the	late	1990s	.
situation	's	a	little	bit	different	where	perhaps	they	know	someone	who	's	hostile	,	where	they	've	got	someone	shooting	at	them	or	doing	something	else	that	's	clearly	hostile	,	throwing	rocks	,	whatever	.
but	if	they	respond	,	there	's	a	range	of	other	people	around	,	who	are	innocent	people	who	might	also	get	hurt	--	be	collateral	damage	that	the	military	often	does	n't	want	to	talk	about	.
so	again	,	they	would	say	,	``	well	if	we	have	access	to	non	-	lethal	weapons	,	if	we	've	got	someone	we	know	is	hostile	,	we	can	do	something	to	deal	with	them	and	know	that	if	we	hit	anyone	else	around	the	place	,	at	least	,	again	,	we	're	not	going	to	kill	them	.	``
another	suggestion	has	been	,	since	we	're	putting	so	many	robots	in	the	field	,	we	can	see	the	time	coming	where	they	're	actually	going	to	be	sending	robots	out	in	the	field	that	are	autonomous	.
they	're	going	to	make	their	own	decisions	about	who	to	shoot	and	who	not	to	shoot	without	a	human	in	the	loop	.
and	so	the	suggestion	is	,	well	hey	,	if	we	're	going	to	send	robots	out	and	allow	them	to	do	this	,	maybe	it	would	be	a	good	idea	,	again	,	with	these	things	if	they	were	armed	with	non	-	lethal	weapons	so	that	if	the	robot	makes	a	bad	decision	and	shoots	the	wrong	person	,	again	,	they	have	n't	actually	killed	them	.
now	there	's	a	whole	range	of	different	sorts	of	non	-	lethal	weapons	,	some	of	which	are	obviously	available	now	,	some	of	which	they	're	developing	.
so	you	've	got	traditional	things	like	pepper	spray	,	o.c	.	spray	up	at	the	top	there	,	or	tasers	over	here	.
the	one	on	the	top	right	here	is	actually	a	dazzling	laser	intended	to	just	blind	the	person	momentarily	and	disorient	them	.
you	've	got	non	-	lethal	shotgun	rounds	that	contain	rubber	pellets	instead	of	the	traditional	metal	ones	.
and	this	one	in	the	middle	here	,	the	large	truck	,	is	actually	called	the	active	denial	system	--	something	the	u.s.	military	is	working	on	at	the	moment	.
it	's	essentially	a	big	microwave	transmitter	.
it	's	sort	of	your	classic	idea	of	a	heat	ray	.
it	goes	out	to	a	really	long	distance	,	compared	to	any	of	these	other	sorts	of	things	.
and	anybody	who	is	hit	with	this	feels	this	sudden	burst	of	heat	and	just	wants	to	get	out	of	the	way	.
it	is	a	lot	more	sophisticated	than	a	microwave	oven	,	but	it	is	basically	boiling	the	water	molecules	in	the	very	surface	level	of	your	skin	.
so	you	feel	this	massive	heat	,	and	you	go	,	``	i	want	to	get	out	of	the	way	.	``
and	they	're	thinking	,	well	this	will	be	really	useful	in	places	like	where	we	need	to	clear	a	crowd	out	of	a	particular	area	,	if	the	crowd	is	being	hostile	.
if	we	need	to	keep	people	away	from	a	particular	place	,	we	can	do	that	with	these	sorts	of	things	.
so	obviously	there	's	a	whole	range	of	different	sorts	of	non	-	lethal	weapons	we	could	give	military	personnel	and	there	's	a	whole	range	of	situations	where	they	're	looking	a	them	and	saying	,	``	hey	,	these	things	could	be	really	useful	.	``
but	as	i	said	,	the	military	and	the	police	are	very	different	.
yes	,	you	do	n't	have	to	look	very	hard	at	this	to	recognize	the	fact	that	they	might	be	very	different	.
in	particular	,	the	attitude	to	the	use	of	force	and	the	way	they	're	trained	to	use	force	is	especially	different	.
the	police	--	and	knowing	because	i	've	actually	helped	to	train	police	--	police	,	in	particular	western	jurisdictions	at	least	,	are	trained	to	de	-	escalate	force	,	to	try	and	avoid	using	force	wherever	possible	,	and	to	use	lethal	force	only	as	an	absolute	last	resort	.
military	personnel	are	being	trained	for	war	,	so	they	're	trained	that	,	as	soon	as	things	go	bad	,	their	first	response	is	lethal	force	.
the	moment	the	fecal	matter	hits	the	rotating	turbine	,	you	can	start	shooting	at	people	.
so	their	attitudes	to	the	use	of	lethal	force	are	very	different	,	and	i	think	it	's	fairly	obvious	that	their	attitude	to	the	use	of	non	-	lethal	weapons	would	also	be	very	different	from	what	it	is	with	the	police	.
and	since	we	've	already	had	so	many	problems	with	police	use	of	non	-	lethal	weapons	in	various	ways	,	i	thought	it	would	be	a	really	good	idea	to	look	at	some	of	those	things	and	try	to	relate	it	to	the	military	context	.
and	i	was	really	surprised	when	i	started	to	do	this	,	to	see	that	,	in	fact	,	even	those	people	who	were	advocating	the	use	of	non	-	lethal	weapons	by	the	military	had	n't	actually	done	that	.
they	generally	seem	to	think	,	``	well	,	why	would	we	care	what	's	happened	with	the	police	?
we	're	looking	at	something	different	,	``	and	did	n't	seem	to	recognize	,	in	fact	,	they	were	looking	at	pretty	much	the	same	stuff	.
so	i	actually	started	to	investigate	some	of	those	issues	and	have	a	look	at	the	way	that	police	use	non	-	lethal	weapons	when	they	're	introduced	and	some	of	the	problems	that	might	arise	out	of	those	sorts	of	things	when	they	actually	do	introduce	them	.
and	of	course	,	being	australian	,	i	started	looking	at	stuff	in	australia	,	knowing	,	again	,	from	my	own	experience	about	various	times	when	non	-	lethal	weapons	have	been	introduced	in	australia	.
so	one	of	the	things	i	particularly	looked	at	was	the	use	of	o.c	.	spray	,	oleoresin	capsicum	spray	,	pepper	spray	,	by	australian	police	and	seeing	when	that	had	been	introduced	,	what	had	happened	and	those	sorts	of	issues	.
and	one	study	that	i	found	,	a	particularly	interesting	one	,	was	actually	in	queensland	,	because	they	had	a	trial	period	for	the	use	of	pepper	spray	before	they	actually	introduced	it	more	broadly	.
and	i	went	and	had	a	look	at	some	of	the	figures	here	.
now	when	they	introduced	o.c	.	spray	in	queensland	,	they	were	really	explicit	.
the	police	minister	had	a	whole	heap	of	public	statements	made	about	it	.
they	were	saying	,	``	this	is	explicitly	intended	to	give	police	an	option	between	shouting	and	shooting	.
this	is	something	they	can	use	instead	of	a	firearm	in	those	situations	where	they	would	have	previously	had	to	shoot	someone	.	``
so	i	went	and	looked	at	all	of	these	police	shooting	figures	.
and	you	ca	n't	actually	find	them	very	easily	for	individual	australian	states	.
i	could	only	find	these	ones	.
this	is	from	a	australian	institute	of	criminology	report	.
as	you	can	see	from	the	fine	print	,	if	you	can	read	it	at	the	top	:	``	police	shooting	deaths	``	means	not	just	people	who	have	been	shot	by	police	,	but	people	who	have	shot	themselves	in	the	presence	of	police	.
but	this	is	the	figures	across	the	entire	country	.
and	the	red	arrow	represents	the	point	where	queensland	actually	said	,	``	yes	,	this	is	where	we	're	going	to	give	all	police	officers	across	the	entire	state	access	to	o.c	.	spray	.	``
so	you	can	see	there	were	six	deaths	sort	of	leading	up	to	it	every	year	for	a	number	of	years	.
there	was	a	spike	,	of	course	,	a	few	years	before	,	but	that	was	n't	actually	queensland	.
anyone	know	where	that	was	?	was	n't	port	arthur	,	no	.
victoria	?	yes	,	correct	.
that	spike	was	all	victoria	.
so	it	was	n't	that	queensland	had	a	particular	problem	with	deaths	from	police	shootings	and	so	on	.
so	six	shootings	across	the	whole	country	,	fairly	consistently	over	the	years	before	.
so	the	next	two	years	were	the	years	they	studied	--	2001	,	2002	.
anyone	want	to	take	a	stab	at	the	number	of	times	,	given	how	they	've	introduced	this	,	the	number	of	times	police	in	queensland	used	o.c	.	spray	in	that	period	?
hundreds	?	one	,	three	.
thousand	is	getting	better	.
explicitly	introduced	as	an	alternative	to	the	use	of	lethal	force	--	an	alternative	between	shouting	and	shooting	.
i	'm	going	to	go	out	on	a	limb	here	and	say	that	if	queensland	police	did	n't	have	o.c	.	spray	,	they	would	n't	have	shot	2,226	people	in	those	two	years	.
in	fact	,	if	you	have	a	look	at	the	studies	that	they	were	looking	at	,	the	material	they	were	collecting	and	examining	,	you	can	see	the	suspects	were	only	armed	in	about	15	percent	of	cases	where	o.c	.	spray	was	used	.
it	was	routinely	being	used	in	this	period	,	and	,	of	course	,	still	is	routinely	used	--	because	there	were	no	complaints	about	it	,	not	within	the	context	of	this	study	anyway	--	it	was	routinely	being	used	to	deal	with	people	who	were	violent	,	who	were	potentially	violent	,	and	also	quite	frequently	used	to	deal	with	people	who	were	simply	passively	non	-	compliant	.
this	person	is	not	doing	anything	violent	,	but	they	just	wo	n't	do	what	we	want	them	to	.
they	're	not	obeying	the	directions	that	we	're	giving	them	,	so	we	'll	give	them	a	shot	of	the	o.c	.	spray	.
that	'll	speed	them	up	.	everything	will	work	out	better	that	way	.
this	was	something	explicitly	introduced	to	be	an	alternative	to	firearms	,	but	it	's	being	routinely	used	to	deal	with	a	whole	range	of	other	sorts	of	problems	.
now	one	of	the	particular	issues	that	comes	up	with	military	use	of	non	-	lethal	weapons	--	and	people	when	they	're	actually	saying	,	``	well	hey	,	there	might	be	some	problems	``	--	there	's	a	couple	of	particular	problems	that	get	focused	on	.
one	of	those	problems	is	that	non	-	lethal	weapons	may	be	used	indiscriminately	.
one	of	the	fundamental	principles	of	military	use	of	force	is	that	you	have	to	be	discriminate	.
you	have	to	be	careful	about	who	you	're	shooting	at	.
so	one	of	the	problems	that	's	been	suggested	with	non	-	lethal	weapons	is	that	they	might	be	used	indiscriminately	--	that	you	use	them	against	a	whole	range	of	people	because	you	do	n't	have	to	worry	so	much	anymore	.
and	in	fact	,	one	particular	instance	where	i	think	that	actually	happens	where	you	can	look	at	it	was	the	dubrovka	theatre	siege	in	moscow	in	2002	,	which	probably	a	lot	of	you	,	unlike	most	of	my	students	at	adfa	,	are	actually	old	enough	to	remember	.
so	chechens	had	come	in	and	taken	control	of	the	theater	.
they	were	holding	something	like	700	people	hostage	.
they	'd	released	a	bunch	of	people	,	but	they	still	had	about	700	people	hostage	.
and	the	russian	special	military	police	,	special	forces	,	spetsnaz	,	came	in	and	actually	stormed	the	theater	.
and	the	way	they	did	it	was	to	pump	the	whole	thing	full	of	anesthetic	gas	.
and	it	turned	out	that	lots	of	these	hostages	actually	died	as	a	result	of	inhaling	the	gas	.
it	was	used	indiscriminately	.
they	pumped	the	whole	theater	full	of	the	gas	.
and	it	's	no	surprise	that	people	died	,	because	you	do	n't	know	how	much	of	this	gas	each	person	is	going	to	inhale	,	what	position	they	're	going	to	fall	in	when	they	become	unconscious	and	so	on	.
there	were	,	in	fact	,	only	a	couple	of	people	who	got	shot	in	this	episode	.
so	when	they	had	a	look	at	it	afterward	,	there	were	only	a	couple	of	people	who	'd	apparently	been	shot	by	the	hostage	takers	or	shot	by	the	police	forces	coming	in	and	trying	to	deal	with	the	situation	.
virtually	everybody	that	got	killed	got	killed	from	inhaling	the	gas	.
the	final	toll	of	hostages	is	a	little	unclear	,	but	it	's	certainly	a	few	more	than	that	,	because	there	were	other	people	who	died	over	the	next	few	days	.
so	this	was	one	particular	problem	they	talked	about	,	that	it	might	be	used	indiscriminately	.
second	problem	that	people	sometimes	talk	about	with	military	use	of	non	-	lethal	weapons	,	and	it	's	actually	the	reason	why	in	the	chemical	weapons	convention	,	it	's	very	clear	that	you	ca	n't	use	riot	control	agents	as	a	weapon	of	warfare	,	the	problem	with	that	is	that	it	's	seen	that	sometimes	non	-	lethal	weapons	might	actually	be	used	,	not	as	an	alternative	to	lethal	force	,	but	as	a	lethal	force	multiplier	--	that	you	use	non	-	lethal	weapons	first	so	that	your	lethal	weapons	will	actually	be	more	effective	.
the	people	you	're	going	to	be	shooting	at	are	n't	going	to	be	able	to	get	out	of	the	way	.
they	're	not	going	to	be	aware	of	what	's	happening	and	you	can	kill	them	better	.
and	in	fact	,	that	's	exactly	what	happened	here	.
the	hostage	takers	who	had	been	rendered	unconscious	by	the	gas	were	not	taken	into	custody	,	they	were	simply	shot	in	the	head	.
so	this	non	-	lethal	weapon	was	being	used	,	in	fact	,	in	this	case	as	a	lethal	force	multiplier	to	make	killing	more	effective	in	this	particular	situation	.
another	problem	that	i	just	want	to	quickly	mention	is	that	there	's	a	whole	heap	of	problems	with	the	way	that	people	actually	get	taught	to	use	non	-	lethal	weapons	and	get	trained	about	them	and	then	get	tested	and	so	on	.
because	they	get	tested	in	nice	,	safe	environments	.
and	people	get	taught	to	use	them	in	nice	,	safe	environments	like	this	,	where	you	can	see	exactly	what	's	going	on	.
the	person	who	's	spraying	the	o.c	.	spray	is	wearing	a	rubber	glove	to	make	sure	they	do	n't	get	contaminated	and	so	on	.
but	they	do	n't	ever	get	used	like	that	.
they	get	used	out	in	the	real	world	,	like	in	texas	,	like	this	.
i	confess	,	this	particular	case	was	actually	one	that	piqued	my	interest	in	this	.
it	happened	while	i	was	working	as	a	research	fellow	at	the	u.s.	naval	academy	.
and	news	reports	started	coming	up	about	this	situation	where	this	woman	was	arguing	with	the	police	officer	.
she	was	n't	violent	.
in	fact	,	he	was	probably	six	inches	taller	than	me	,	and	she	was	about	this	tall	.
and	eventually	she	said	to	him	``	well	i	'm	going	to	get	back	in	my	car	.	``
and	he	says	,	``	if	you	get	back	into	your	car	,	i	'm	going	to	tase	you	.	``
and	she	says	,	``	oh	,	go	ahead	.	tase	me	.	``	and	so	he	does	.
and	it	's	all	captured	by	the	video	camera	running	in	the	front	of	the	police	car	.
so	she	's	72	,	and	it	's	seen	that	this	is	the	most	appropriate	way	of	dealing	with	her	.
and	other	examples	of	the	same	sorts	of	things	with	other	people	where	you	think	where	you	think	,	``	is	this	really	an	appropriate	way	to	use	non	-	lethal	weapons	?	``
``	police	chief	fires	taser	into	14	year	-	old	girl	's	head	.	``
``	she	was	running	away	.	what	else	was	i	suppose	to	do	?	``
or	florida	:	``	police	taser	six	year	-	old	boy	at	elementary	school	.	``
and	they	clearly	learned	a	lot	from	it	because	in	the	same	district	,	``	police	review	policy	after	children	shocked	:	2nd	child	shocked	by	taser	stun	gun	within	weeks	.	``
same	police	district	.
another	child	within	weeks	of	tasering	the	six	year	-	old	boy	.
just	in	case	you	think	it	's	only	going	to	happen	in	the	united	states	,	it	happened	in	canada	as	well	.
and	a	colleague	of	mine	sent	me	this	one	from	london	.
but	my	personal	favorite	of	these	ones	,	i	have	to	confess	,	does	actually	come	from	the	united	states	:	``	officers	taser	86	year	-	old	disabled	woman	in	her	bed	.	``
i	checked	the	reports	on	this	one	.
i	looked	at	it	.	i	was	really	surprised	.
apparently	she	took	up	a	more	threatening	position	in	her	bed	.
i	kid	you	not	.	that	's	exactly	what	it	said	.
``	she	took	up	a	more	threatening	position	in	her	bed	.	``
okay	.
but	i	'd	remind	you	what	i	'm	talking	about	,	i	'm	talking	about	military	uses	of	non	-	lethal	weapons	.
so	why	is	this	relevant	?
because	police	are	actually	more	restrained	in	the	use	of	force	than	the	military	are	.
they	're	trained	to	be	more	restrained	in	the	use	of	force	than	the	military	are	.
they	're	trained	to	think	more	,	to	try	and	de	-	escalate	.
so	if	you	have	these	problems	with	police	officers	with	non	-	lethal	weapons	,	what	on	earth	would	make	you	think	it	's	going	to	be	better	with	military	personnel	?
the	last	thing	that	i	would	just	like	to	say	,	when	i	'm	talking	to	the	police	about	what	a	perfect	non	-	lethal	weapon	would	look	like	,	they	almost	inevitably	say	the	same	thing	.
they	say	,	``	well	,	it	's	got	to	be	something	that	's	nasty	enough	that	people	do	n't	want	to	be	hit	with	this	weapon	.
so	if	you	threaten	to	use	it	,	people	are	going	to	comply	with	it	,	but	it	's	also	going	to	be	something	that	does	n't	leave	any	lasting	effects	.	``
in	other	words	,	your	perfect	non	-	lethal	weapon	is	something	that	's	perfect	for	abuse	.
what	would	these	guys	have	done	if	they	'd	had	access	to	tasers	or	to	a	manned	,	portable	version	of	the	active	denial	system	--	a	small	heat	ray	that	you	can	use	on	people	and	not	worry	about	it	.
so	i	think	,	yes	,	there	may	be	ways	that	non	-	lethal	weapons	are	going	to	be	great	in	these	situations	,	but	there	's	also	a	whole	heap	of	problems	that	need	to	be	considered	as	well	.
thanks	very	much	.
