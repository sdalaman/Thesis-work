when	you	think	about	resilience	and	technology	it	's	actually	much	easier	.
you	're	going	to	see	some	other	speakers	today	,	i	already	know	,	who	are	going	to	talk	about	breaking	-	bones	stuff	,	and	,	of	course	,	with	technology	it	never	is	.
so	it	's	very	easy	,	comparatively	speaking	,	to	be	resilient	.
i	think	that	,	if	we	look	at	what	happened	on	the	internet	,	with	such	an	incredible	last	half	a	dozen	years	,	that	it	's	hard	to	even	get	the	right	analogy	for	it	.
a	lot	of	how	we	decide	,	how	we	're	supposed	to	react	to	things	and	what	we	're	supposed	to	expect	about	the	future	depends	on	how	we	bucket	things	and	how	we	categorize	them	.
and	so	i	think	the	tempting	analogy	for	the	boom	-	bust	that	we	just	went	through	with	the	internet	is	a	gold	rush	.
it	's	easy	to	think	of	this	analogy	as	very	different	from	some	of	the	other	things	you	might	pick	.
for	one	thing	,	both	were	very	real	.
in	1849	,	in	that	gold	rush	,	they	took	over	$	700	million	worth	of	gold	out	of	california	.	it	was	very	real	.
the	internet	was	also	very	real	.	this	is	a	real	way	for	humans	to	communicate	with	each	other	.	it	's	a	big	deal	.
huge	boom	.	huge	boom	.	huge	bust	.	huge	bust	.
you	keep	going	,	and	both	things	are	lots	of	hype	.
i	do	n't	have	to	remind	you	of	all	the	hype	that	was	involved	with	the	internet	--	like	getrich.com	.
but	you	had	the	same	thing	with	the	gold	rush	.	``	gold	.	gold	.	gold	.	``
sixty	-	eight	rich	men	on	the	steamer	portland	.	stacks	of	yellow	metal	.
some	have	5,000	.	many	have	more	.
a	few	bring	out	100,000	dollars	each	.
people	would	get	very	excited	about	this	when	they	read	these	articles	.
``	the	eldorado	of	the	united	states	of	america	:	the	discovery	of	inexhaustible	gold	mines	in	california	.	``
and	the	parallels	between	the	gold	rush	and	the	internet	rush	continue	very	strongly	.
so	many	people	left	what	they	were	doing	.
and	what	would	happen	is	--	and	the	gold	rush	went	on	for	years	.
people	on	the	east	coast	in	1849	,	when	they	first	started	to	get	the	news	,	they	thought	,	``	ah	,	this	is	n't	real	.	``
but	they	keep	hearing	about	people	getting	rich	,	and	then	in	1850	they	still	hear	that	.	and	they	think	it	's	not	real	.
by	about	1852	,	they	're	thinking	,	``	am	i	the	stupidest	person	on	earth	by	not	rushing	to	california	?	``	and	they	start	to	decide	they	are	.
these	are	community	affairs	,	by	the	way	.
local	communities	on	the	east	coast	would	get	together	and	whole	teams	of	10	,	20	people	would	caravan	across	the	united	states	,	and	they	would	form	companies	.
these	were	typically	not	solitary	efforts	.	but	no	matter	what	,	if	you	were	a	lawyer	or	a	banker	,	people	dropped	what	they	were	doing	,	no	matter	what	skill	set	they	had	,	to	go	pan	for	gold	.
this	guy	on	the	left	,	dr.	richard	beverley	cole	,	he	lived	in	philadelphia	and	he	took	the	panama	route	.
they	would	take	a	ship	down	to	panama	,	across	the	isthmus	,	and	then	take	another	ship	north	.
this	guy	,	dr.	toland	,	went	by	covered	wagon	to	california	.
this	has	its	parallels	,	too	.	doctors	leaving	their	practices	.
these	are	both	very	successful	--	a	physician	in	one	case	,	a	surgeon	in	the	other	.
same	thing	happened	on	the	internet	.	you	get	drkoop.com	.
in	the	gold	rush	,	people	literally	jumped	ship	.
the	san	francisco	harbor	was	clogged	with	600	ships	at	the	peak	because	the	ships	would	get	there	and	the	crews	would	abandon	to	go	search	for	gold	.
so	there	were	literally	600	captains	and	600	ships	.
they	turned	the	ships	into	hotels	,	because	they	could	n't	sail	them	anywhere	.
you	had	dotcom	fever	.	and	you	had	gold	fever	.
and	you	saw	some	of	the	excesses	that	the	dotcom	fever	created	and	the	same	thing	happened	.
the	fort	in	san	francisco	at	the	time	had	about	1,300	soldiers	.
half	of	them	deserted	to	go	look	for	gold	.
and	they	would	n't	let	the	other	half	out	to	go	look	for	the	first	half	because	they	were	afraid	they	would	n't	come	back	.
and	one	of	the	soldiers	wrote	home	,	and	this	is	the	sentence	that	he	put	:	``	the	struggle	between	right	and	six	dollars	a	month	and	wrong	and	75	dollars	a	day	is	a	rather	severe	one	.	``
they	had	bad	burn	rate	in	the	gold	rush	.	a	very	bad	burn	rate	.
this	is	actually	from	the	klondike	gold	rush	.	this	is	the	white	pass	trail	.
they	loaded	up	their	mules	and	their	horses	.
and	they	did	n't	plan	right	.
and	they	did	n't	know	how	far	they	would	really	have	to	go	,	and	they	overloaded	the	horses	with	hundreds	and	hundreds	of	pounds	of	stuff	.
in	fact	it	was	so	bad	that	most	of	the	horses	died	before	they	could	get	where	they	were	going	.
it	got	renamed	the	``	dead	horse	trail	.	``
and	the	canadian	minister	of	the	interior	wrote	this	at	the	time	:	``	thousands	of	pack	horses	lie	dead	along	the	way	,	sometimes	in	bunches	under	the	cliffs	,	with	pack	saddles	and	packs	where	they	've	fallen	from	the	rock	above	,	sometimes	in	tangled	masses	,	filling	the	mud	holes	and	furnishing	the	only	footing	for	our	poor	pack	animals	on	the	march	,	often	,	i	regret	to	say	,	exhausted	,	but	still	alive	,	a	fact	we	were	unaware	of	,	until	after	the	miserable	wretches	turned	beneath	the	hooves	of	our	cavalcade	.
the	eyeless	sockets	of	the	pack	animals	everywhere	account	for	the	myriads	of	ravens	along	the	road	.
the	inhumanity	which	this	trail	has	been	witness	to	,	the	heartbreak	and	suffering	which	so	many	have	undergone	,	can	not	be	imagined	.	they	certainly	can	not	be	described	.	``
and	you	know	,	without	the	smell	that	would	have	accompanied	that	,	we	had	the	same	thing	on	the	internet	:	very	bad	burn	rate	calculations	.
i	'll	just	play	one	of	these	and	you	'll	remember	it	.
this	is	a	commercial	that	was	played	on	the	super	bowl	in	the	year	2000	.
:	bride	#	1	:	you	said	you	had	a	large	selection	of	invitations	.	clerk	:	but	we	do	.
bride	#	2	:	then	why	does	she	have	my	invitation	?
announcer	:	what	may	be	a	little	thing	to	some	...	bride	#	3	:	you	are	mine	,	little	man	.
announcer	:	could	be	a	really	big	deal	to	you	.	husband	#	1	:	is	that	your	wife	?
husband	#	2	:	not	for	another	15	minutes	.	announcer	:	after	all	,	it	's	your	special	day	.
ourbeginning.com	.	life	's	an	event	.	announce	it	to	the	world	.
jeff	bezos	:	it	's	very	difficult	to	figure	out	what	that	ad	is	for	.
but	they	spent	three	and	a	half	million	dollars	in	the	2000	super	bowl	to	air	that	ad	,	even	though	,	at	the	time	,	they	only	had	a	million	dollars	in	annual	revenue	.
now	,	here	's	where	our	analogy	with	the	gold	rush	starts	to	diverge	,	and	i	think	rather	severely	.
and	that	is	,	in	a	gold	rush	,	when	it	's	over	,	it	's	over	.
here	's	this	guy	:	``	there	are	many	men	in	dawson	at	the	present	time	who	feel	keenly	disappointed	.
they	've	come	thousands	of	miles	on	a	perilous	trip	,	risked	life	,	health	and	property	,	spent	months	of	the	most	arduous	labor	a	man	can	perform	and	at	length	with	expectations	raised	to	the	highest	pitch	have	reached	the	coveted	goal	only	to	discover	the	fact	that	there	is	nothing	here	for	them	.	``
and	that	was	,	of	course	,	the	very	common	story	.
because	when	you	take	out	that	last	piece	of	gold	--	and	they	did	incredibly	quickly	.	i	mean	,	if	you	look	at	the	1849	gold	rush	--	the	entire	american	river	region	,	within	two	years	--	every	stone	had	been	turned	.	and	after	that	,	only	big	companies	who	used	more	sophisticated	mining	technologies	started	to	take	gold	out	of	there	.
so	there	's	a	much	better	analogy	that	allows	you	to	be	incredibly	optimistic	and	that	analogy	is	the	electric	industry	.
and	there	are	a	lot	of	similarities	between	the	internet	and	the	electric	industry	.
with	the	electric	industry	you	actually	have	to	--	one	of	them	is	that	they	're	both	sort	of	thin	,	horizontal	,	enabling	layers	that	go	across	lots	of	different	industries	.
it	's	not	a	specific	thing	.
but	electricity	is	also	very	,	very	broad	,	so	you	have	to	sort	of	narrow	it	down	.
you	know	,	it	can	be	used	as	an	incredible	means	of	transmitting	power	.
it	's	an	incredible	means	of	coordinating	,	in	a	very	fine	-	grained	way	,	information	flows	.
there	's	a	bunch	of	things	that	are	interesting	about	electricity	.
and	the	part	of	the	electric	revolution	that	i	want	to	focus	on	is	sort	of	the	golden	age	of	appliances	.
the	killer	app	that	got	the	world	ready	for	appliances	was	the	light	bulb	.
so	the	light	bulb	is	what	wired	the	world	.
and	they	were	n't	thinking	about	appliances	when	they	wired	the	world	.
they	were	really	thinking	about	--	they	were	n't	putting	electricity	into	the	home	;	they	were	putting	lighting	into	the	home	.
and	,	but	it	really	--	it	got	the	electricity	.	it	took	a	long	time	.
this	was	a	huge	--	as	you	would	expect	--	a	huge	capital	build	out	.
all	the	streets	had	to	be	torn	up	.
this	is	work	going	on	down	in	lower	manhattan	where	they	built	some	of	the	first	electric	power	generating	stations	.
and	they	're	tearing	up	all	the	streets	.
the	edison	electric	company	,	which	became	edison	general	electric	,	which	became	general	electric	,	paid	for	all	of	this	digging	up	of	the	streets	.	it	was	incredibly	expensive	.
but	that	is	not	the	--	and	that	's	not	the	part	that	's	really	most	similar	to	the	web	.
because	,	remember	,	the	web	got	to	stand	on	top	of	all	this	heavy	infrastructure	that	had	been	put	in	place	because	of	the	long	-	distance	phone	network	.
so	all	of	the	cabling	and	all	of	the	heavy	infrastructure	--	i	'm	going	back	now	to	,	sort	of	,	the	explosive	part	of	the	web	in	1994	,	when	it	was	growing	2,300	percent	a	year	.
how	could	it	grow	at	2,300	percent	a	year	in	1994	when	people	were	n't	really	investing	in	the	web	?
well	,	it	was	because	that	heavy	infrastructure	had	already	been	laid	down	.
so	the	light	bulb	laid	down	the	heavy	infrastructure	,	and	then	home	appliances	started	coming	into	being	.
and	this	was	huge	.	the	first	one	was	the	electric	fan	--	this	was	the	1890	electric	fan	.
and	the	appliances	,	the	golden	age	of	appliances	really	lasted	--	it	depends	how	you	want	to	measure	it	--	but	it	's	anywhere	from	40	to	60	years	.	it	goes	on	a	long	time	.
it	starts	about	1890	.	and	the	electric	fan	was	a	big	success	.
the	electric	iron	,	also	very	big	.
by	the	way	,	this	is	the	beginning	of	the	asbestos	lawsuit	.
there	's	asbestos	under	that	handle	there	.
this	is	the	first	vacuum	cleaner	,	the	1905	skinner	vacuum	,	from	the	hoover	company	.	and	this	one	weighed	92	pounds	and	took	two	people	to	operate	and	cost	a	quarter	of	a	car	.
so	it	was	n't	a	big	seller	.
this	was	truly	,	truly	an	early	-	adopter	product	--	the	1905	skinner	vacuum	.
but	three	years	later	,	by	1908	,	it	weighed	40	pounds	.
now	,	not	all	these	things	were	highly	successful	.
this	is	the	electric	tie	press	,	which	never	really	did	catch	on	.
people	,	i	guess	,	decided	that	they	would	not	wrinkle	their	ties	.
these	never	really	caught	on	either	:	the	electric	shoe	warmer	and	drier	.	never	a	big	seller	.
this	came	in	,	like	,	six	different	colors	.
i	do	n't	know	why	.	but	i	thought	,	you	know	,	sometimes	it	's	just	not	the	right	time	for	an	invention	;	maybe	it	's	time	to	give	this	one	another	shot	.
so	i	thought	we	could	build	a	super	bowl	ad	for	this	.
we	'd	need	the	right	partner	.	and	i	thought	that	really	--	i	thought	that	would	really	work	,	to	give	that	another	shot	.
now	,	the	toaster	was	huge	because	they	used	to	make	toast	on	open	fires	,	and	it	took	a	lot	of	time	and	attention	.
i	want	to	point	out	one	thing	.	this	is	--	you	guys	know	what	this	is	.
they	had	n't	invented	the	electric	socket	yet	.
so	this	was	--	remember	,	they	did	n't	wire	the	houses	for	electricity	.
they	wired	them	for	lighting	.	so	your	--	your	appliances	would	plug	in	.
they	would	--	each	room	typically	had	a	light	bulb	socket	at	the	top	.
and	you	'd	plug	it	in	there	.
in	fact	,	if	you	've	seen	the	carousel	of	progress	at	disney	world	,	you	've	seen	this	.	here	are	the	cables	coming	up	into	this	light	fixture	.
all	the	appliances	plug	in	there	.	and	you	would	just	unscrew	your	light	bulb	if	you	wanted	to	plug	in	an	appliance	.
the	next	thing	that	really	was	a	big	,	big	deal	was	the	washing	machine	.
now	,	this	was	an	object	of	much	envy	and	lust	.
everybody	wanted	one	of	these	electric	washing	machines	.
on	the	left	-	hand	side	,	this	was	the	soapy	water	.
and	there	's	a	rotor	there	--	that	this	motor	is	spinning	.
and	it	would	clean	your	clothes	.
this	is	the	clean	rinse	-	water	.	so	you	'd	take	the	clothes	out	of	here	,	put	them	in	here	,	and	then	you	'd	run	the	clothes	through	this	electric	ringer	.
and	this	was	a	big	deal	.
you	'd	keep	this	on	your	porch	.	it	was	a	little	bit	messy	and	kind	of	a	pain	.
and	you	'd	run	a	long	cord	into	the	house	where	you	could	screw	it	into	your	light	socket	.
and	that	's	actually	kind	of	an	important	point	in	my	presentation	,	because	they	had	n't	invented	the	off	switch	.
that	was	to	come	much	later	--	the	off	switch	on	appliances	--	because	it	did	n't	make	any	sense	.
i	mean	,	you	did	n't	want	this	thing	clogging	up	a	light	socket	.
so	you	know	,	when	you	were	done	with	it	,	you	unscrewed	it	.
that	's	what	you	did	.	you	did	n't	turn	it	off	.
and	as	i	said	before	,	they	had	n't	invented	the	electric	outlet	either	,	so	the	washing	machine	was	a	particularly	dangerous	device	.
and	there	are	--	when	you	research	this	,	there	are	gruesome	descriptions	of	people	getting	their	hair	and	clothes	caught	in	these	devices	.
and	they	could	n't	yank	the	cord	out	because	it	was	screwed	into	a	light	socket	inside	the	house	.
and	there	was	no	off	switch	,	so	it	was	n't	very	good	.
and	you	might	think	that	that	was	incredibly	stupid	of	our	ancestors	to	be	plugging	things	into	a	light	socket	like	this	.
but	,	you	know	,	before	i	get	too	far	into	condemning	our	ancestors	,	i	thought	i	'd	show	you	:	this	is	my	conference	room	.
this	is	a	total	kludge	,	if	you	ask	me	.
first	of	all	,	this	got	installed	upside	down	.	this	light	socket	--	and	so	the	cord	keeps	falling	out	,	so	i	taped	it	in	.
this	is	supposed	--	do	n't	even	get	me	started	.	but	that	's	not	the	worst	one	.
this	is	what	it	looks	like	under	my	desk	.
i	took	this	picture	just	two	days	ago	.
so	we	really	have	n't	progressed	that	much	since	1908	.
it	's	a	total	,	total	mess	.
and	,	you	know	,	we	think	it	's	getting	better	,	but	have	you	tried	to	install	802.11	yourself	?
i	challenge	you	to	try	.	it	's	very	hard	.
i	know	ph	.	d.	s	in	computer	science	--	this	process	has	brought	them	to	tears	,	absolute	tears	.
and	that	's	assuming	you	already	have	dsl	in	your	house	.
try	to	get	dsl	installed	in	your	house	.
the	engineers	who	do	it	everyday	ca	n't	do	it	.
they	have	to	--	typically	,	they	come	three	times	.
and	one	friend	of	mine	was	telling	me	a	story	:	not	only	did	they	get	there	and	have	to	wait	,	but	then	the	engineers	,	when	they	finally	did	get	there	,	for	the	third	time	,	they	had	to	call	somebody	.
and	they	were	really	happy	that	the	guy	had	a	speakerphone	because	then	they	had	to	wait	on	hold	for	an	hour	to	talk	to	somebody	to	give	them	an	access	code	after	they	got	there	.
so	we	're	not	--	we	're	pretty	kludge	-	y	ourselves	.
by	the	way	,	dsl	is	a	kludge	.
i	mean	,	this	is	a	twisted	pair	of	copper	that	was	never	designed	for	the	purpose	it	's	being	put	to	--	you	know	it	's	the	whole	thing	--	we	're	very	,	very	primitive	.	and	that	's	kind	of	the	point	.
because	,	you	know	,	resilience	--	if	you	think	of	it	in	terms	of	the	gold	rush	,	then	you	'd	be	pretty	depressed	right	now	because	the	last	nugget	of	gold	would	be	gone	.
but	the	good	thing	is	,	with	innovation	,	there	is	n't	a	last	nugget	.
every	new	thing	creates	two	new	questions	and	two	new	opportunities	.
and	if	you	believe	that	,	then	you	believe	that	where	we	are	--	this	is	what	i	think	--	i	believe	that	where	we	are	with	the	incredible	kludge	--	and	i	have	n't	even	talked	about	user	interfaces	on	the	web	--	but	there	's	so	much	kludge	,	so	much	terrible	stuff	--	we	are	at	the	1908	hurley	washing	machine	stage	with	the	internet	.
that	's	where	we	are	.	we	do	n't	get	our	hair	caught	in	it	,	but	that	's	the	level	of	primitiveness	of	where	we	are	.
we	're	in	1908	.
and	if	you	believe	that	,	then	stuff	like	this	does	n't	bother	you	.	this	is	1996	:	``	all	the	negatives	add	up	to	making	the	online	experience	not	worth	the	trouble	.	``
1998	:	``	amazon	.	toast	.	``	in	1999	:	``	amazon	.	bomb	.	``
my	mom	hates	this	picture	.
she	--	but	you	know	,	if	you	really	do	believe	that	it	's	the	very	,	very	beginning	,	if	you	believe	it	's	the	1908	hurley	washing	machine	,	then	you	're	incredibly	optimistic	.	and	i	do	think	that	that	's	where	we	are	.
and	i	do	think	there	's	more	innovation	ahead	of	us	than	there	is	behind	us	.
and	in	1917	,	sears	--	i	want	to	get	this	exactly	right	.
this	was	the	advertisement	that	they	ran	in	1917	.
it	says	:	``	use	your	electricity	for	more	than	light	.	``
and	i	think	that	's	where	we	are	.
we	're	very	,	very	early	.	thank	you	very	much	.
