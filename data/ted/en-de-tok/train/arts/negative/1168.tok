a	couple	of	years	ago	when	i	was	attending	the	ted	conference	in	long	beach	,	i	met	harriet	.
we	'd	actually	met	online	before	--	not	the	way	you	're	thinking	.
we	were	actually	introduced	because	we	both	knew	linda	avey	,	one	of	the	founders	of	the	first	online	personal	genomic	companies	.
and	because	we	shared	our	genetic	information	with	linda	,	she	could	see	that	harriet	and	i	shared	a	very	rare	type	of	mitochondrial	dna	--	haplotype	k	1a1b1a	--	which	meant	that	we	were	distantly	related	.
we	actually	share	the	same	genealogy	with	ozzie	the	iceman	.
so	ozzie	,	harriet	and	me	.
and	being	the	current	day	,	of	course	,	we	started	our	own	facebook	group	.
you	're	all	welcome	to	join	.
and	when	i	met	harriet	in	person	the	next	year	at	the	ted	conference	,	she	'd	gone	online	and	ordered	our	own	happy	haplotype	t	-	shirts	.
now	why	am	i	telling	you	this	story	,	and	what	does	this	have	to	do	with	the	future	of	health	?
well	the	way	i	met	harriet	is	actually	an	example	of	how	leveraging	cross	-	disciplinary	,	exponentially	-	growing	technologies	is	affecting	our	future	of	health	and	wellness	--	from	low	-	cost	gene	analysis	to	the	ability	to	do	powerful	bio	-	informatics	to	the	connection	of	the	internet	and	social	networking	.
what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	today	is	understanding	these	exponential	technologies	.
we	often	think	linearly	.
but	if	you	think	about	it	,	if	you	have	a	lily	pad	and	it	just	divided	every	single	day	--	two	,	four	,	eight	,	16	--	in	15	days	you	have	32,000	.
what	do	you	think	you	have	in	a	month	?	we	're	at	a	billion	.
so	if	we	start	to	think	exponentially	,	we	can	see	how	this	is	starting	to	affect	all	the	technologies	around	us	.
and	many	of	these	technologies	--	speaking	as	a	physician	and	innovator	--	we	can	really	start	to	leverage	to	impact	the	future	of	our	own	health	and	of	health	care	,	and	to	address	many	of	the	major	challenges	that	we	have	in	health	care	today	,	ranging	from	the	really	exponential	costs	to	the	aging	population	,	the	way	we	really	do	n't	use	information	very	well	today	,	the	fragmentation	of	care	and	often	the	very	difficult	course	of	adoption	of	innovation	.
and	one	of	the	major	things	we	can	do	we	've	talked	a	bit	about	here	today	is	moving	the	curve	to	the	left	.
we	spend	most	of	our	money	on	the	last	20	percent	of	life	.
what	if	we	could	spend	and	incentivize	positions	in	the	health	care	system	and	our	own	self	to	move	the	curve	to	the	left	and	improve	our	health	,	leveraging	technology	as	well	?
now	my	favorite	technology	,	example	of	exponential	technology	,	we	all	have	in	our	pocket	.
so	if	you	think	about	it	,	these	are	really	dramatically	improving	.
i	mean	this	is	the	iphone	4	.
imagine	what	the	iphone	8	will	be	able	to	do	.
now	,	i	've	gained	some	insight	into	this	.
i	've	been	the	track	share	for	the	medicine	portion	of	a	new	institution	called	singularity	university	based	in	silicon	valley	.
and	we	bring	together	every	summer	about	100	very	talented	students	from	around	the	world	.
and	we	look	at	these	exponential	technologies	from	medicine	,	biotech	,	artificial	intelligence	,	robotics	,	nanotechnology	,	space	,	and	address	how	can	we	cross	-	train	and	leverage	these	to	impact	major	unmet	goals	.
we	also	have	seven	-	day	executive	programs	.
and	coming	up	next	month	is	actually	future	med	,	a	program	to	help	cross	-	train	and	leverage	technologies	into	medicine	.
now	i	mentioned	the	phone	.
these	mobile	phones	have	over	20,000	different	mobile	apps	available	--	to	the	point	where	there	's	one	out	of	the	u.k	.
where	you	can	pee	on	a	little	chip	connected	to	your	iphone	and	check	yourself	for	an	std	.
i	do	n't	know	if	i	'd	try	that	yet	,	but	that	's	available	.
there	are	all	other	sorts	of	applications	,	merging	your	phone	and	diagnostics	,	for	example	--	measuring	your	blood	glucose	on	your	iphone	and	sending	that	,	potentially	,	to	your	physician	so	they	can	better	understand	and	you	can	better	understand	your	blood	sugars	as	a	diabetic	.
so	let	's	see	now	how	exponential	technologies	are	taking	health	care	.
let	's	start	with	faster	.
well	it	's	no	secret	that	computers	,	through	moore	's	law	,	are	speeding	up	faster	and	faster	.
we	have	the	ability	to	do	more	powerful	things	with	them	.
they	're	really	approaching	,	in	many	cases	surpassing	,	the	ability	of	the	human	mind	.
but	where	i	think	computational	speed	is	most	applicable	is	in	that	of	imaging	.
the	ability	now	to	look	inside	the	body	in	real	time	with	very	high	resolution	is	really	becoming	incredible	.
and	we	're	layering	multiple	technologies	--	pet	scans	,	ct	scans	and	molecular	diagnostics	--	to	find	and	to	seek	things	at	different	levels	.
here	you	're	going	to	see	the	very	highest	resolution	mri	scan	done	today	,	reconstructed	of	marc	hodosh	,	the	curator	of	tedmed	.
and	now	we	can	see	inside	of	the	brain	with	a	resolution	and	ability	that	was	never	before	available	,	and	essentially	learn	how	to	reconstruct	,	and	maybe	even	re	-	engineer	,	or	backwards	engineer	,	the	brain	so	we	can	better	understand	pathology	,	disease	and	therapy	.
we	can	look	inside	with	real	time	fmri	--	in	the	brain	at	real	time	.
and	by	understanding	these	sorts	of	processes	and	these	sorts	of	connections	,	we	're	going	to	understand	the	effects	of	medication	or	meditation	and	better	personalize	and	make	effective	,	for	example	,	psychoactive	drugs	.
the	scanners	for	these	are	getting	small	,	less	expensive	and	more	portable	.
and	this	sort	of	data	explosion	available	from	these	is	really	almost	becoming	a	challenge	.
the	scan	of	today	takes	up	about	800	books	,	or	20	gigabytes	.
the	scan	in	a	couple	of	years	will	be	one	terabyte	,	or	800,000	books	.
how	do	you	leverage	that	information	?
let	's	get	personal	.	i	wo	n't	ask	who	here	's	had	a	colonoscopy	,	but	if	you	're	over	age	50	,	it	's	time	for	your	screening	colonoscopy	.
how	would	you	like	to	avoid	the	pointy	end	of	the	stick	?
well	now	there	's	essentially	a	virtual	colonoscopy	.
compare	those	two	pictures	,	and	now	as	a	radiologist	,	you	can	essentially	fly	through	your	patient	's	colon	and	,	augmenting	that	with	artificial	intelligence	,	identify	potentially	,	as	you	see	here	,	a	lesion	.
oh	,	we	might	have	missed	it	,	but	using	a.i	.	on	top	of	radiology	,	we	can	find	lesions	that	were	missed	before	.
and	maybe	this	will	encourage	people	to	get	colonoscopies	that	would	n't	have	otherwise	.
and	this	is	an	example	of	this	paradigm	shift	.
we	're	moving	to	this	integration	of	biomedicine	,	information	technology	,	wireless	and	,	i	would	say	,	mobile	now	--	this	era	of	digital	medicine	.
so	even	my	stethoscope	is	now	digital	.
and	of	course	,	there	's	an	app	for	that	.
we	're	moving	,	obviously	,	to	the	era	of	the	tricorder	.
so	the	handheld	ultrasound	is	basically	surpassing	and	supplanting	the	stethoscope	.
these	are	now	at	a	price	point	of	--	what	used	to	be	100,000	euros	or	a	couple	of	hundred	-	thousand	dollars	--	for	about	5,000	dollars	,	i	can	have	the	power	of	a	very	powerful	diagnostic	device	in	my	hand	.
and	merging	this	now	with	the	advent	of	electronic	medical	records	--	in	the	united	states	,	we	're	still	less	than	20	percent	electronic	.
here	in	the	netherlands	,	i	think	it	's	more	than	80	percent	.
but	now	that	we	're	switching	to	merging	medical	data	,	making	it	available	electronically	,	we	can	crowd	source	that	information	,	and	now	as	a	physician	,	i	can	access	my	patients	'	data	from	wherever	i	am	just	through	my	mobile	device	.
and	now	,	of	course	,	we	're	in	the	era	of	the	ipad	,	even	the	ipad	2	.
and	just	last	month	the	first	fda	-	approved	application	was	approved	to	allow	radiologists	to	do	actual	reading	on	these	sorts	of	devices	.
so	certainly	,	the	physicians	of	today	,	including	myself	,	are	completely	reliable	on	these	devices	.
and	as	you	saw	just	about	a	month	ago	,	watson	from	ibm	beat	the	two	champions	in	jeopardy	.
so	i	want	you	to	imagine	when	in	a	couple	of	years	,	when	we	've	started	to	apply	this	cloud	-	based	information	,	when	we	really	have	the	a.i	.	physician	and	leverage	our	brains	to	connectivity	to	make	decisions	and	diagnostics	at	a	level	never	done	.
already	today	,	you	do	n't	need	to	go	to	your	physician	in	many	cases	.
only	for	about	20	percent	of	actual	visits	do	you	have	to	lay	hands	on	the	patient	.
we	're	now	in	the	era	of	virtual	visits	--	from	sort	of	the	skype	-	type	visits	you	can	do	with	american	well	,	to	cisco	that	's	developed	a	very	complex	health	presence	system	.
the	ability	to	interact	with	your	health	care	provider	is	different	.
and	these	are	being	augmented	even	by	our	devices	again	today	.
here	my	friend	jessica	sent	me	a	picture	of	her	head	laceration	so	i	can	save	her	a	trip	to	the	emergency	room	--	i	can	do	some	diagnostics	that	way	.
or	might	we	be	able	to	leverage	today	's	gaming	technology	,	like	the	microsoft	kinect	,	and	hack	that	to	enable	diagnostics	,	for	example	,	in	diagnosing	stroke	,	using	simple	motion	detection	,	using	hundred	-	dollar	devices	.
we	can	actually	now	visit	our	patients	robotically	--	this	is	the	rp	7	;	if	i	'm	a	hematologist	,	visit	another	clinic	,	visit	a	hospital	.
these	will	be	augmented	by	a	whole	suite	of	tools	actually	in	the	home	now	.
so	imagine	we	already	have	wireless	scales	.
you	can	step	on	the	scale	.
you	can	tweet	your	weight	to	your	friends	,	and	they	can	keep	you	in	line	.
we	have	wireless	blood	pressure	cuffs	.
a	whole	gamut	of	these	technologies	are	being	put	together	.
so	instead	of	wearing	these	kludgy	devices	,	we	can	put	on	a	simple	patch	.
this	was	developed	by	colleagues	at	stanford	,	called	the	irhythm	--	completely	supplants	the	prior	technology	at	a	much	lower	price	point	with	much	more	effectivity	.
now	we	're	also	in	the	era	,	today	,	of	quantified	self	.
consumers	now	can	buy	basically	hundred	-	dollar	devices	,	like	this	little	fitbit	.
i	can	measure	my	steps	,	my	caloric	outtake	.
i	can	get	insight	into	that	on	a	daily	basis	.
i	can	share	that	with	my	friends	,	with	my	physician	.
there	's	watches	coming	out	that	will	measure	your	heart	rate	,	the	zeo	sleep	monitors	,	a	whole	suite	of	tools	that	can	enable	you	to	leverage	and	have	insight	into	your	own	health	.
and	as	we	start	to	integrate	this	information	,	we	're	going	to	know	better	what	to	do	with	it	and	how	better	to	have	insight	into	our	own	pathologies	,	health	and	wellness	.
there	's	even	mirrors	today	that	can	pick	up	your	pulse	rate	.
and	i	would	argue	,	in	the	future	,	we	'll	have	wearable	devices	in	our	clothes	,	monitoring	ourselves	24/7	.
and	just	like	we	have	the	onstar	system	in	cars	,	your	red	light	might	go	on	--	it	wo	n't	say	``	check	engine	``	though	.
it	's	going	to	be	``	check	your	body	``	light	,	and	go	in	and	get	it	taken	care	of	.
probably	in	a	few	years	,	you	'll	check	into	your	mirror	and	it	's	going	to	be	diagnosing	you	.
for	those	of	you	with	kiddos	at	home	,	how	would	you	like	to	have	the	wireless	diaper	that	supports	your	...
too	much	information	,	i	think	,	than	you	might	need	.
but	it	's	going	to	be	here	.
now	we	've	heard	a	lot	today	about	new	technology	and	connection	.
and	i	think	some	of	these	technologies	will	enable	us	to	be	more	connected	with	our	patients	,	and	take	more	time	and	actually	do	the	important	human	touch	elements	of	medicine	,	as	augmented	by	these	sorts	of	technologies	.
now	we	've	talked	about	augmenting	the	patient	,	to	some	degree	.
how	about	augmenting	the	physician	?
we	're	now	in	the	era	of	super	-	enabling	the	surgeon	who	can	now	go	inside	the	body	and	do	things	with	robotic	surgery	,	which	is	here	today	,	at	a	level	that	was	not	really	possible	even	five	years	ago	.
now	this	is	being	augmented	with	further	layers	of	technology	like	augmented	reality	.
so	the	surgeon	can	see	inside	the	patient	,	through	their	lens	,	where	the	tumor	is	,	where	the	blood	vessels	are	.
this	can	be	integrated	with	decisions	support	.
a	surgeon	in	new	york	can	be	helping	a	surgeon	in	amsterdam	,	for	example	.
and	we	're	entering	an	era	of	really	,	truly	scarless	surgery	called	notes	,	where	the	robotic	endoscope	can	come	out	the	stomach	and	pull	out	that	gallbladder	all	in	a	scarless	way	and	robotically	.
and	this	is	called	notes	,	and	this	is	coming	--	basically	scarless	surgery	,	as	mediated	by	robotic	surgery	.
now	how	about	controlling	other	elements	?
for	those	who	have	disabilities	--	the	paraplegic	--	there	's	the	era	of	brain	-	computer	interface	,	or	bci	,	where	chips	have	been	put	on	the	motor	cortex	of	completely	quadriplegic	patients	and	they	can	control	a	curser	or	a	wheelchair	or	,	eventually	,	a	robotic	arm	.
and	these	devices	are	getting	smaller	and	going	into	more	and	more	of	these	patients	.
still	in	clinical	trials	,	but	imagine	when	we	can	connect	these	,	for	example	,	to	the	amazing	bionic	limb	,	such	as	the	deka	arm	built	by	dean	kamen	and	colleagues	,	which	has	17	degrees	of	motion	and	freedom	and	can	allow	the	person	who	's	lost	a	limb	to	have	much	higher	levels	of	dexterity	or	control	than	they	've	had	in	the	past	.
so	we	're	really	entering	the	era	of	wearable	robotics	actually	.
if	you	have	n't	lost	a	limb	--	you	've	had	a	stroke	,	for	example	--	you	can	wear	these	augmented	limbs	.
or	if	you	're	a	paraplegic	--	like	i	've	visited	the	folks	at	berkley	bionics	--	they	've	developed	elegs	.
i	took	this	video	last	week	.	here	's	a	paraplegic	patient	actually	walking	by	strapping	on	these	exoskeletons	.
he	's	otherwise	completely	wheelchair	-	bound	.
and	now	this	is	the	early	era	of	wearable	robotics	.
and	i	think	by	leveraging	these	sorts	of	technologies	,	we	're	going	to	change	the	definition	of	disability	to	in	some	cases	be	superability	,	or	super	-	enabling	.
this	is	aimee	mullins	,	who	lost	her	lower	limbs	as	a	young	child	,	and	hugh	herr	,	who	's	a	professor	at	mit	who	lost	his	limbs	in	a	climbing	accident	.
and	now	both	of	these	can	climb	better	,	move	faster	,	swim	differently	with	their	prosthetics	than	us	normal	-	abled	persons	.
now	how	about	other	exponentials	?
clearly	the	obesity	trend	is	exponentially	going	in	the	wrong	direction	,	including	with	huge	costs	.
but	the	trend	in	medicine	actually	is	to	get	exponentially	smaller	.
so	a	few	examples	:	we	're	now	in	the	era	of	``	fantastic	voyage	,	``	the	ipill	.
you	can	swallow	this	completely	integrated	device	.
it	can	take	pictures	of	your	gi	system	,	help	diagnose	and	treat	as	it	moves	through	your	gi	tract	.
we	get	into	even	smaller	micro	-	robots	that	will	eventually	autonomously	move	through	your	system	again	and	be	able	to	do	things	that	surgeons	ca	n't	do	in	a	much	less	invasive	manner	.
sometimes	these	might	self	-	assemble	in	your	gi	system	and	be	augmented	in	that	reality	.
on	the	cardiac	side	,	pacemakers	are	getting	smaller	and	much	easier	to	place	so	you	do	n't	need	to	train	an	interventional	cardiologist	to	place	them	.
and	they	're	going	to	be	wirelessly	telemetered	again	to	your	mobile	devices	so	you	can	go	places	and	be	monitored	remotely	.
these	are	shrinking	even	further	.
here	's	one	that	's	in	prototyping	by	medtronic	that	's	smaller	than	a	penny	.
artificial	retinas	,	the	ability	to	put	these	arrays	on	the	back	of	the	eyeball	and	allow	the	blind	to	see	.
again	,	in	early	trials	,	but	moving	into	the	future	.
these	are	going	to	be	game	changing	.
or	for	those	of	us	who	are	sighted	,	how	about	having	the	assisted	-	living	contact	lens	?
bluetooth	,	wifi	available	--	beams	back	images	to	your	eye	.
now	if	you	have	trouble	maintaining	your	diet	,	it	might	help	to	have	some	extra	imagery	to	remind	you	how	many	calories	are	going	to	be	coming	at	you	.
how	about	enabling	the	pathologist	to	use	their	cell	phone	again	to	see	at	a	microscopic	level	and	to	lumber	that	data	back	to	the	cloud	and	make	better	diagnostics	?
in	fact	,	the	whole	era	of	laboratory	medicine	is	completely	changing	.
we	can	now	leverage	microfluidics	,	like	this	chip	made	by	steve	quake	at	stanford	.
microfluidics	can	replace	an	entire	lab	of	technicians	.
put	it	on	a	chip	,	enable	thousands	of	tests	to	be	done	at	the	point	of	care	,	anywhere	in	the	world	.
and	this	is	really	going	to	leverage	technology	to	the	rural	and	the	under	-	served	and	enable	what	used	to	be	thousand	-	dollar	tests	to	be	done	at	pennies	and	at	the	point	of	care	.
if	we	go	down	the	small	pathway	a	little	bit	farther	,	we	're	entering	the	era	of	nanomedicine	,	the	ability	to	make	devices	super	small	to	the	point	where	we	can	design	red	blood	cells	or	microrobots	that	will	monitor	our	blood	system	or	immune	system	,	or	even	those	that	might	clear	out	the	clots	from	our	arteries	.
now	how	about	exponentially	cheaper	?
not	something	we	usually	think	about	in	the	era	of	medicine	,	but	hard	disks	used	to	be	3,400	dollars	for	10	megabytes	--	exponentially	cheaper	.
in	genomics	now	,	the	genome	cost	about	a	billion	dollars	about	10	years	ago	when	the	first	one	came	out	.
we	're	now	approaching	essentially	a	thousand	-	dollar	genome	--	probably	next	year	to	two	years	,	probably	a	hundred	-	dollar	genome	.
what	are	we	going	to	do	with	hundred	-	dollar	genomes	?
and	soon	we	'll	have	millions	of	these	tests	available	.
and	that	's	when	it	gets	interesting	,	when	we	start	to	crowdsource	that	information	.
and	we	enter	the	era	of	true	personalized	medicine	--	the	right	drug	for	the	right	person	at	the	right	time	--	instead	of	what	we	're	doing	today	,	which	is	the	same	drug	for	everybody	--	sort	of	blockbuster	drug	medications	,	medications	which	do	n't	work	for	you	,	the	individual	.
and	many	,	many	different	companies	are	working	on	leveraging	these	approaches	.
and	i	'll	also	show	you	a	simple	example	,	from	23andme	again	.
my	data	indicates	that	i	've	got	about	average	risk	for	developing	macular	degeneration	,	a	kind	of	blindness	.
but	if	i	take	that	same	data	,	upload	it	to	decodeme	,	i	can	look	at	my	risk	for	sample	type	ii	diabetes	.
i	'm	at	almost	twice	the	risk	for	type	ii	diabetes	.
i	might	want	to	watch	how	much	dessert	i	have	at	the	lunch	break	for	example	.
it	might	change	my	behavior	.
leveraging	my	knowledge	of	my	pharmacogenomics	--	how	my	genes	modulate	,	what	my	drugs	do	and	what	doses	i	need	are	going	to	become	increasingly	important	,	and	once	in	the	hands	of	the	individual	and	the	patient	,	will	make	better	drug	dosing	and	selection	available	.
so	again	,	it	's	not	just	genes	,	it	's	multiple	details	--	our	habits	,	our	environmental	exposure	.
when	was	the	last	time	your	physician	asked	you	where	you	've	lived	?
geomedicine	:	where	you	've	lived	,	what	you	've	been	exposed	to	,	can	dramatically	affect	your	health	.
we	can	capture	that	information	.
so	genomics	,	proteomics	,	the	environment	,	all	this	data	streaming	at	us	individually	and	us	,	as	poor	physicians	,	how	do	we	manage	it	?
well	we	're	now	entering	the	era	of	systems	medicine	,	or	systems	biology	,	where	we	can	start	to	integrate	all	of	this	information	.
and	by	looking	at	the	patterns	,	for	example	,	in	our	blood	of	10,000	biomarkers	in	a	single	test	,	we	can	start	to	look	at	these	little	patterns	and	detect	disease	at	a	much	earlier	stage	.
this	has	been	called	by	lee	hood	,	the	father	of	the	field	,	p	4	medicine	.
we	're	going	to	be	predictive	;	we	're	going	to	know	what	you	're	likely	to	have	.
we	can	be	preventative	;	that	prevention	can	be	personalized	;	and	more	importantly	,	it	's	going	to	become	increasingly	participatory	.
through	websites	like	patients	like	me	or	managing	your	data	on	microsoft	healthvault	or	google	health	,	leveraging	this	together	in	participatory	ways	is	going	to	become	increasingly	important	.
so	i	'll	finish	up	with	exponentially	better	.
we	'd	like	to	get	therapies	better	and	more	effective	.
now	today	we	treat	high	blood	pressure	mostly	with	pills	.
what	if	we	take	a	new	device	and	knock	out	the	nerve	vessels	that	help	mediate	blood	pressure	and	in	a	single	therapy	to	cure	hypertension	?
this	is	a	new	device	that	is	essentially	doing	that	.
it	should	be	on	the	market	within	a	year	or	two	.
how	about	more	targeted	therapies	for	cancer	?
right	,	i	'm	an	oncologist	and	i	have	to	say	most	of	what	we	give	is	actually	poison	.
we	've	learned	at	stanford	and	other	places	that	we	can	discover	cancer	stem	cells	,	the	ones	that	seem	to	be	really	responsible	for	disease	relapse	.
so	if	you	think	of	cancer	as	a	weed	,	we	often	can	whack	the	weed	away	.
it	seems	to	shrink	,	but	it	often	comes	back	.
so	we	're	attacking	the	wrong	target	.
the	cancer	stem	cells	remain	,	and	the	tumor	can	return	months	or	years	later	.
we	're	now	learning	to	identify	the	cancer	stem	cells	and	identify	those	as	targets	and	go	for	the	long	-	term	cure	.
and	we	're	entering	the	era	of	personalized	oncology	,	the	ability	to	leverage	all	of	this	data	together	,	analyze	the	tumor	and	come	up	with	a	real	,	specific	cocktail	for	the	individual	patient	.
now	i	'll	close	with	regenerative	medicine	.
so	i	've	studied	a	lot	about	stem	cells	--	embryonic	stem	cells	are	particularly	powerful	.
we	also	have	adult	stem	cells	throughout	our	body	.
we	use	those	in	my	field	of	bone	marrow	transplantation	.
geron	,	just	last	year	,	started	the	first	trial	using	human	embryonic	stem	cells	to	treat	spinal	cord	injuries	.
still	a	phase	i	trial	,	but	evolving	.
we	've	been	actually	using	adult	stem	cells	now	in	clinical	trials	for	about	15	years	to	approach	a	whole	range	of	topics	,	particularly	in	cardiovascular	disease	.
we	take	our	own	bone	marrow	cells	and	treat	a	patient	with	a	heart	attack	,	we	can	see	much	improved	heart	function	and	actually	better	survival	using	our	own	bone	marrow	drive	cells	after	a	heart	attack	.
i	invented	a	device	called	the	marrowminer	,	a	much	less	invasive	way	for	harvesting	bone	marrow	.
it	's	now	been	fda	approved	,	and	it	'll	hopefully	be	on	the	market	in	the	next	year	or	so	.
hopefully	you	can	appreciate	the	device	there	curving	through	the	patient	's	body	and	removing	the	patient	's	bone	marrow	,	instead	of	with	200	punctures	,	with	just	a	single	puncture	under	local	anesthesia	.
but	where	is	stem	cell	therapy	really	going	?
if	you	think	about	it	,	every	cell	in	your	body	has	the	same	dna	as	you	had	when	you	were	an	embryo	.
we	can	now	reprogram	your	skin	cells	to	actually	act	like	a	pluripotent	embryonic	stem	cell	and	to	utilize	those	potentially	to	treat	multiple	organs	in	that	same	patient	--	making	your	own	personalized	stem	cell	lines	.
and	i	think	they	'll	be	a	new	era	of	your	own	stem	cell	banking	to	have	in	the	freezer	your	own	cardiac	cells	,	myocytes	and	neural	cells	to	use	them	in	the	future	,	should	you	need	them	.
and	we	're	integrating	this	now	with	a	whole	era	of	cellular	engineering	,	and	integrating	exponential	technologies	for	essentially	3d	organ	printing	--	replacing	the	ink	with	cells	and	essentially	building	and	reconstructing	a	3d	organ	.
that	's	where	things	are	going	to	head	--	still	very	early	days	.
but	i	think	,	as	integration	of	exponential	technologies	,	this	is	the	example	.
so	in	close	,	as	you	think	about	technology	trends	and	how	to	impact	health	and	medicine	,	we	're	entering	an	era	of	miniaturization	,	decentralization	and	personalization	.
and	i	think	by	pulling	these	things	together	,	if	we	can	start	to	think	about	how	to	understand	and	leverage	these	,	we	're	going	to	empower	the	patient	,	enable	the	doctor	,	enhance	wellness	and	begin	to	cure	the	well	before	they	get	sick	.
because	i	know	as	a	doctor	,	if	someone	comes	to	me	with	stage	i	disease	,	i	'm	thrilled	--	we	can	often	cure	them	.
but	often	it	's	too	late	and	it	's	stage	iii	or	iv	cancer	,	for	example	.
so	by	leveraging	these	technologies	together	,	i	think	we	'll	enter	a	new	era	that	i	like	to	call	stage	0	medicine	.
and	as	a	cancer	doctor	,	i	'm	looking	forward	to	being	out	of	a	job	.
thanks	very	much	.
host	:	thank	you	.	thank	you	.
take	a	bow	.	take	a	bow	.
