let	me	talk	about	india	through	the	evolution	of	ideas	.
now	i	believe	this	is	an	interesting	way	of	looking	at	it	because	in	every	society	,	especially	an	open	democratic	society	,	it	's	only	when	ideas	take	root	that	things	change	.
slowly	ideas	lead	to	ideology	,	lead	to	policies	that	lead	to	actions	.
in	1930	this	country	went	through	a	great	depression	,	which	led	to	all	the	ideas	of	the	state	and	social	security	,	and	all	the	other	things	that	happened	in	roosevelt	's	time	.
in	the	1980s	we	had	the	reagan	revolution	,	which	lead	to	deregulation	.
and	today	,	after	the	global	economic	crisis	,	there	was	a	whole	new	set	of	rules	about	how	the	state	should	intervene	.
so	ideas	change	states	.
and	i	looked	at	india	and	said	,	really	there	are	four	kinds	of	ideas	which	really	make	an	impact	on	india	.
the	first	,	to	my	mind	,	is	what	i	call	as	``	the	ideas	that	have	arrived	.	``
these	ideas	have	brought	together	something	which	has	made	india	happen	the	way	it	is	today	.
the	second	set	of	ideas	i	call	``	ideas	in	progress	.	``
those	are	ideas	which	have	been	accepted	but	not	implemented	yet	.
the	third	set	of	ideas	are	what	i	call	as	``	ideas	that	we	argue	about	``	--	those	are	ideas	where	we	have	a	fight	,	an	ideological	battle	about	how	to	do	things	.
and	the	fourth	thing	,	which	i	believe	is	most	important	,	is	``	the	ideas	that	we	need	to	anticipate	.	``
because	when	you	are	a	developing	country	in	the	world	where	you	can	see	the	problems	that	other	countries	are	having	,	you	can	actually	anticipate	what	that	did	and	do	things	very	differently	.
now	in	india	's	case	i	believe	there	are	six	ideas	which	are	responsible	for	where	it	has	come	today	.
the	first	is	really	the	notion	of	people	.
in	the	'60s	and	'70s	we	thought	of	people	as	a	burden	.
we	thought	of	people	as	a	liability	.
today	we	talk	of	people	as	an	asset	.
we	talk	of	people	as	human	capital	.
and	i	believe	this	change	in	the	mindset	,	of	looking	at	people	as	something	of	a	burden	to	human	capital	,	has	been	one	of	the	fundamental	changes	in	the	indian	mindset	.
and	this	change	in	thinking	of	human	capital	is	linked	to	the	fact	that	india	is	going	through	a	demographic	dividend	.
as	healthcare	improves	,	as	infant	mortality	goes	down	,	fertility	rates	start	dropping	.	and	india	is	experiencing	that	.
india	is	going	to	have	a	lot	of	young	people	with	a	demographic	dividend	for	the	next	30	years	.
what	is	unique	about	this	demographic	dividend	is	that	india	will	be	the	only	country	in	the	world	to	have	this	demographic	dividend	.
in	other	words	,	it	will	be	the	only	young	country	in	an	aging	world	.
and	this	is	very	important	.	at	the	same	time	if	you	peel	away	the	demographic	dividend	in	india	,	there	are	actually	two	demographic	curves	.
one	is	in	the	south	and	in	the	west	of	india	,	which	is	already	going	to	be	fully	expensed	by	2015	,	because	in	that	part	of	the	country	,	the	fertility	rate	is	almost	equal	to	that	of	a	west	european	country	.
then	there	is	the	whole	northern	india	,	which	is	going	to	be	the	bulk	of	the	future	demographic	dividend	.
but	a	demographic	dividend	is	only	as	good	as	the	investment	in	your	human	capital	.
only	if	the	people	have	education	,	they	have	good	health	,	they	have	infrastructure	,	they	have	roads	to	go	to	work	,	they	have	lights	to	study	at	night	--	only	in	those	cases	can	you	really	get	the	benefit	of	a	demographic	dividend	.
in	other	words	,	if	you	do	n't	really	invest	in	the	human	capital	,	the	same	demographic	dividend	can	be	a	demographic	disaster	.
therefore	india	is	at	a	critical	point	where	either	it	can	leverage	its	demographic	dividend	or	it	can	lead	to	a	demographic	disaster	.
the	second	thing	in	india	has	been	the	change	in	the	role	of	entrepreneurs	.
when	india	got	independence	entrepreneurs	were	seen	as	a	bad	lot	,	as	people	who	would	exploit	.
but	today	,	after	60	years	,	because	of	the	rise	of	entrepreneurship	,	entrepreneurs	have	become	role	models	,	and	they	are	contributing	hugely	to	the	society	.
this	change	has	contributed	to	the	vitality	and	the	whole	economy	.
the	third	big	thing	i	believe	that	has	changed	india	is	our	attitude	towards	the	english	language	.
english	language	was	seen	as	a	language	of	the	imperialists	.
but	today	,	with	globalization	,	with	outsourcing	,	english	has	become	a	language	of	aspiration	.
this	has	made	it	something	that	everybody	wants	to	learn	.
and	the	fact	that	we	have	english	is	now	becoming	a	huge	strategic	asset	.
the	next	thing	is	technology	.
forty	years	back	,	computers	were	seen	as	something	which	was	forbidding	,	something	which	was	intimidating	,	something	that	reduced	jobs	.
today	we	live	in	a	country	which	sells	eight	million	mobile	phones	a	month	,	of	which	90	percent	of	those	mobile	phones	are	prepaid	phones	because	people	do	n't	have	credit	history	.
forty	percent	of	those	prepaid	phones	are	recharged	at	less	than	20	cents	at	each	recharge	.
that	is	the	scale	at	which	technology	has	liberated	and	made	it	accessible	.
and	therefore	technology	has	gone	from	being	seen	as	something	forbidding	and	intimidating	to	something	that	is	empowering	.
twenty	years	back	,	when	there	was	a	report	on	bank	computerization	,	they	did	n't	name	the	report	as	a	report	on	computers	,	they	call	them	as	``	ledger	posting	machines	.	``
they	did	n't	want	the	unions	to	believe	that	they	were	actually	computers	.
and	when	they	wanted	to	have	more	advanced	,	more	powerful	computers	they	called	them	``	advanced	ledger	posting	machines	.	``
so	we	have	come	a	long	way	from	those	days	where	the	telephone	has	become	an	instrument	of	empowerment	,	and	really	has	changed	the	way	indians	think	of	technology	.
and	then	i	think	the	other	point	is	that	indians	today	are	far	more	comfortable	with	globalization	.
again	,	after	having	lived	for	more	than	200	years	under	the	east	india	company	and	under	imperial	rule	,	indians	had	a	very	natural	reaction	towards	globalization	believing	it	was	a	form	of	imperialism	.
but	today	,	as	indian	companies	go	abroad	,	as	indians	come	and	work	all	over	the	world	,	indians	have	gained	a	lot	more	confidence	and	have	realized	that	globalization	is	something	they	can	participate	in	.
and	the	fact	that	the	demographics	are	in	our	favor	,	because	we	are	the	only	young	country	in	an	aging	world	,	makes	globalization	all	the	more	attractive	to	indians	.
and	finally	,	india	has	had	the	deepening	of	its	democracy	.
when	democracy	came	to	india	60	years	back	it	was	an	elite	concept	.
it	was	a	bunch	of	people	who	wanted	to	bring	in	democracy	because	they	wanted	to	bring	in	the	idea	of	universal	voting	and	parliament	and	constitution	and	so	forth	.
but	today	democracy	has	become	a	bottom	-	up	process	where	everybody	has	realized	the	benefits	of	having	a	voice	,	the	benefits	of	being	in	an	open	society	.
and	therefore	democracy	has	become	embedded	.
i	believe	these	six	factors	--	the	rise	of	the	notion	of	population	as	human	capital	,	the	rise	of	indian	entrepreneurs	,	the	rise	of	english	as	a	language	of	aspiration	,	technology	as	something	empowering	,	globalization	as	a	positive	factor	,	and	the	deepening	of	democracy	--	has	contributed	to	why	india	is	today	growing	at	rates	it	has	never	seen	before	.
but	having	said	that	,	then	we	come	to	what	i	call	as	ideas	in	progress	.
those	are	the	ideas	where	there	is	no	argument	in	a	society	,	but	you	are	not	able	to	implement	those	things	.
and	really	there	are	four	things	here	.
one	is	the	question	of	education	.
for	some	reason	,	whatever	reason	--	lack	of	money	,	lack	of	priorities	,	because	of	religion	having	an	older	culture	--	primary	education	was	never	given	the	focus	it	required	.
but	now	i	believe	it	's	reached	a	point	where	it	has	become	very	important	.
unfortunately	the	government	schools	do	n't	function	,	so	children	are	going	to	private	schools	today	.
even	in	the	slums	of	india	more	than	50	percent	of	urban	kids	are	going	into	private	schools	.
so	there	is	a	big	challenge	in	getting	the	schools	to	work	.
but	having	said	that	,	there	is	an	enormous	desire	among	everybody	,	including	the	poor	,	to	educate	their	children	.
so	i	believe	primary	education	is	an	idea	which	is	arrived	but	not	yet	implemented	.
similarly	,	infrastructure	--	for	a	long	time	,	infrastructure	was	not	a	priority	.
those	of	you	who	have	been	to	india	have	seen	that	.
it	's	certainly	not	like	china	.
but	today	i	believe	finally	infrastructure	is	something	which	is	agreed	upon	and	which	people	want	to	implement	.
it	is	reflected	in	the	political	statements	.
20	years	back	the	political	slogan	was	,	``	roti	,	kapada	,	makaan	,	``	which	meant	,	``	food	,	clothing	and	shelter	.	``
and	today	's	political	slogan	is	,	``	bijli	,	sadak	,	pani	,	``	which	means	``	electricity	,	water	and	roads	.	``
and	that	is	a	change	in	the	mindset	where	infrastructure	is	now	accepted	.
so	i	do	believe	this	is	an	idea	which	has	arrived	,	but	simply	not	implemented	.
the	third	thing	is	again	cities	.
it	's	because	gandhi	believed	in	villages	and	because	the	british	ruled	from	the	cities	,	therefore	nehru	thought	of	new	delhi	as	an	un	-	indian	city	.
for	a	long	time	we	have	neglected	our	cities	.
and	that	is	reflected	in	the	kinds	of	situations	that	you	see	.
but	today	,	finally	,	after	economic	reforms	,	and	economic	growth	,	i	think	the	notion	that	cities	are	engines	of	economic	growth	,	cities	are	engines	of	creativity	,	cities	are	engines	of	innovation	,	have	finally	been	accepted	.
and	i	think	now	you	're	seeing	the	move	towards	improving	our	cities	.
again	,	an	idea	which	is	arrived	,	but	not	yet	implemented	.
the	final	thing	is	the	notion	of	india	as	a	single	market	--	because	when	you	did	n't	think	of	india	as	a	market	,	you	did	n't	really	bother	about	a	single	market	,	because	it	did	n't	really	matter	.
and	therefore	you	had	a	situation	where	every	state	had	its	own	market	for	products	.
every	province	had	its	own	market	for	agriculture	.
increasingly	now	the	policies	of	taxation	and	infrastructure	and	all	that	,	are	moving	towards	creating	india	as	a	single	market	.
so	there	is	a	form	of	internal	globalization	which	is	happening	,	which	is	as	important	as	external	globalization	.
these	four	factors	i	believe	--	the	ones	of	primary	education	,	infrastructure	,	urbanization	,	and	single	market	--	in	my	view	are	ideas	in	india	which	have	been	accepted	,	but	not	implemented	.
then	we	have	what	i	believe	are	the	ideas	in	conflict	.
the	ideas	that	we	argue	about	.
these	are	the	arguments	we	have	which	cause	gridlock	.
what	are	those	ideas	?	one	is	,	i	think	,	are	ideological	issues	.
because	of	the	historical	indian	background	,	in	the	caste	system	,	and	because	of	the	fact	that	there	have	been	many	people	who	have	been	left	out	in	the	cold	,	a	lot	of	the	politics	is	about	how	to	make	sure	that	we	'll	address	that	.
and	it	leads	to	reservations	and	other	techniques	.
it	's	also	related	to	the	way	that	we	subsidize	our	people	,	and	all	the	left	and	right	arguments	that	we	have	.
a	lot	of	the	indian	problems	are	related	to	the	ideology	of	caste	and	other	things	.
this	policy	is	causing	gridlock	.
this	is	one	of	the	factors	which	needs	to	be	resolved	.
the	second	one	is	the	labor	policies	that	we	have	,	which	make	it	so	difficult	for	entrepreneurs	to	create	standardized	jobs	in	companies	,	that	93	percent	of	indian	labor	is	in	the	unorganized	sector	.
they	have	no	benefits	:	they	do	n't	have	social	security	;	they	do	n't	have	pension	;	they	do	n't	have	healthcare	;	none	of	those	things	.
this	needs	to	be	fixed	because	unless	you	can	bring	these	people	into	the	formal	workforce	,	you	will	end	up	creating	a	whole	lot	of	people	who	are	completely	disenfranchised	.
therefore	we	need	to	create	a	new	set	of	labor	laws	,	which	are	not	as	onerous	as	they	are	today	.
at	the	same	time	give	a	policy	for	a	lot	more	people	to	be	in	the	formal	sector	,	and	create	the	jobs	for	the	millions	of	people	that	we	need	to	create	jobs	for	.
the	third	thing	is	our	higher	education	.
indian	higher	education	is	completely	regulated	.
it	's	very	difficult	to	start	a	private	university	.
it	's	very	difficult	for	a	foreign	university	to	come	to	india	.
as	a	result	of	that	our	higher	education	is	simply	not	keeping	pace	with	india	's	demands	.
that	is	leading	to	a	lot	of	problems	which	we	need	to	address	.
but	most	important	i	believe	are	the	ideas	we	need	to	anticipate	.
here	india	can	look	at	what	is	happening	in	the	west	and	elsewhere	,	and	look	at	what	needs	to	be	done	.
the	first	thing	is	,	we	're	very	fortunate	that	technology	is	at	a	point	where	it	is	much	more	advanced	than	when	other	countries	had	the	development	.
so	we	can	use	technology	for	governance	.
we	can	use	technology	for	direct	benefits	.
we	can	use	technology	for	transparency	,	and	many	other	things	.
the	second	thing	is	,	the	health	issue	.
india	has	equally	horrible	health	problems	of	the	higher	state	of	cardiac	issue	,	the	higher	state	of	diabetes	,	the	higher	state	of	obesity	.
so	there	is	no	point	in	replacing	a	set	of	poor	country	diseases	with	a	set	of	rich	country	diseases	.
therefore	we	're	to	rethink	the	whole	way	we	look	at	health	.
we	really	need	to	put	in	place	a	strategy	so	that	we	do	n't	go	to	the	other	extreme	of	health	.
similarly	today	in	the	west	you	're	seeing	the	problem	of	entitlement	--	the	cost	of	social	security	,	the	cost	of	medicare	,	the	cost	of	medicaid	.
therefore	when	you	are	a	young	country	,	again	you	have	a	chance	to	put	in	place	a	modern	pension	system	so	that	you	do	n't	create	entitlement	problems	as	you	grow	old	.
and	then	again	,	india	does	not	have	the	luxury	of	making	its	environment	dirty	,	because	it	has	to	marry	environment	and	development	.
just	to	give	an	idea	,	the	world	has	to	stabilize	at	something	like	20	gigatons	per	year	.
on	a	population	of	nine	billion	our	average	carbon	emission	will	have	to	be	about	two	tons	per	year	.
india	is	already	at	two	tons	per	year	.
but	if	india	grows	at	something	like	eight	percent	,	income	per	year	per	person	will	go	to	16	times	by	2050	.
so	we	're	saying	:	income	growing	at	16	times	and	no	growth	in	carbon	.
therefore	we	will	fundamentally	rethink	the	way	we	look	at	the	environment	,	the	way	we	look	at	energy	,	the	way	we	create	whole	new	paradigms	of	development	.
now	why	does	this	matter	to	you	?
why	does	what	's	happening	10	thousand	miles	away	matter	to	all	of	you	?
number	one	,	this	matters	because	this	represents	more	than	a	billion	people	.
a	billion	people	,	1/6th	of	the	world	population	.
it	matters	because	this	is	a	democracy	.
and	it	is	important	to	prove	that	growth	and	democracy	are	not	incompatible	,	that	you	can	have	a	democracy	,	that	you	can	have	an	open	society	,	and	you	can	have	growth	.
it	's	important	because	if	you	solve	these	problems	,	you	can	solve	the	problems	of	poverty	in	the	world	.
it	's	important	because	you	need	it	to	solve	the	world	's	environment	problems	.
if	we	really	want	to	come	to	a	point	,	we	really	want	to	put	a	cap	on	our	carbon	emission	,	we	want	to	really	lower	the	use	of	energy	--	it	has	to	be	solved	in	countries	like	india	.
you	know	if	you	look	at	the	development	in	the	west	over	200	years	,	the	average	growth	may	have	been	about	two	percent	.
here	we	are	talking	about	countries	growing	at	eight	to	nine	percent	.
and	that	makes	a	huge	difference	.
when	india	was	growing	at	about	three	,	3.5	percent	and	the	population	was	growing	at	two	percent	,	its	per	capita	income	was	doubling	every	45	years	.
when	the	economic	growth	goes	to	eight	percent	and	population	growth	drops	to	1.5	percent	,	then	per	capita	income	is	doubling	every	nine	years	.
in	other	words	,	you	're	certainly	fast	-	forwarding	this	whole	process	of	a	billion	people	going	to	prosperity	.
and	you	must	have	a	clear	strategy	which	is	important	for	india	and	important	for	the	world	.
that	is	why	i	think	all	of	you	should	be	equally	concerned	with	it	as	i	am	.
thank	you	very	much	.
