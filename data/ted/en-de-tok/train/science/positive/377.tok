this	session	is	on	natural	wonders	,	and	the	bigger	conference	is	on	the	pursuit	of	happiness	.
i	want	to	try	to	combine	them	all	,	because	to	me	,	healing	is	really	the	ultimate	natural	wonder	.
your	body	has	a	remarkable	capacity	to	begin	healing	itself	,	and	much	more	quickly	than	people	had	once	realized	,	if	you	simply	stop	doing	what	's	causing	the	problem	.
and	so	,	really	,	so	much	of	what	we	do	in	medicine	and	life	in	general	is	focused	on	mopping	up	the	floor	without	also	turning	off	the	faucet	.
i	love	doing	this	work	,	because	it	really	gives	many	people	new	hope	and	new	choices	that	they	did	n't	have	before	,	and	it	allows	us	to	talk	about	things	that	--	not	just	diet	,	but	that	happiness	is	not	--	we	're	talking	about	the	pursuit	of	happiness	,	but	when	you	really	look	at	all	the	spiritual	traditions	,	what	aldous	huxley	called	the	``	perennial	wisdom	,	``	when	you	get	past	the	named	and	forms	and	rituals	that	really	divide	people	,	it	's	really	about	--	our	nature	is	to	be	happy	;	our	nature	is	to	be	peaceful	,	our	nature	is	to	be	healthy	.
and	so	it	's	not	something	--	happiness	is	not	something	you	get	,	health	is	generally	not	something	that	you	get	.
but	rather	all	of	these	different	practices	--	you	know	,	the	ancient	swamis	and	rabbis	and	priests	and	monks	and	nuns	did	n't	develop	these	techniques	to	just	manage	stress	or	lower	your	blood	pressure	,	unclog	your	arteries	,	even	though	it	can	do	all	those	things	.
they	're	powerful	tools	for	transformation	,	for	quieting	down	our	mind	and	bodies	to	allow	us	to	experience	what	it	feels	like	to	be	happy	,	to	be	peaceful	,	to	be	joyful	and	to	realize	that	it	's	not	something	that	you	pursue	and	get	,	but	rather	it	's	something	that	you	have	already	until	you	disturb	it	.
i	studied	yoga	for	many	years	with	a	teacher	named	swami	satchidananda	and	people	would	say	,	``	what	are	you	,	a	hindu	?	``	he	'd	say	,	``	no	,	i	'm	an	undo	.	``
and	it	's	really	about	identifying	what	's	causing	us	to	disturb	our	innate	health	and	happiness	,	and	then	to	allow	that	natural	healing	to	occur	.
to	me	,	that	's	the	real	natural	wonder	.
so	,	within	that	larger	context	,	we	can	talk	about	diet	,	stress	management	--	which	are	really	these	spiritual	practices	--	moderate	exercise	,	smoking	cessation	,	support	groups	and	community	--	which	i	'll	talk	more	about	--	and	some	vitamins	and	supplements	.
and	it	's	not	a	diet	.
you	know	,	when	most	people	think	about	the	diet	i	recommend	,	they	think	it	's	a	really	strict	diet	.
for	reversing	disease	,	that	's	what	it	takes	,	but	if	you	're	just	trying	to	be	healthy	,	you	have	a	spectrum	of	choices	.
and	to	the	degree	that	you	can	move	in	a	healthy	direction	,	you	're	going	to	live	longer	,	you	're	going	to	feel	better	,	you	're	going	to	lose	weight	,	and	so	on	.
and	in	our	studies	,	what	we	've	been	able	to	do	is	to	use	very	expensive	,	high	-	tech	,	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	measures	to	prove	how	powerful	these	very	simple	and	low	-	tech	and	low	-	cost	--	and	in	many	ways	,	ancient	--	interventions	,	can	be	.
we	first	began	by	looking	at	heart	disease	,	and	when	i	began	doing	this	work	26	or	27	years	ago	,	it	was	thought	that	once	you	have	heart	disease	it	can	only	get	worse	.
and	what	we	found	was	that	,	instead	of	getting	worse	and	worse	,	in	many	cases	it	could	get	better	and	better	,	and	much	more	quickly	than	people	had	once	realized	.
this	is	a	representative	patient	who	at	the	time	was	73	--	totally	needed	to	have	a	bypass	,	decided	to	do	this	instead	.
we	used	quantitative	arteriography	,	showing	the	narrowing	.
this	is	one	of	the	arteries	that	feed	the	heart	,	one	of	the	main	arteries	,	and	you	can	see	the	narrowing	here	.
a	year	later	,	it	's	not	as	clogged	;	normally	,	it	goes	the	other	direction	.
these	minor	changes	in	blockages	caused	a	300	percent	improvement	in	blood	flow	,	and	using	cardiac	positron	emission	tomography	,	or	``	pet	,	``	scans	,	blue	and	black	is	no	blood	flow	,	orange	and	white	is	maximal	.
huge	differences	can	occur	without	drugs	,	without	surgery	.
clinically	,	he	literally	could	n't	walk	across	the	street	without	getting	severe	chest	pain	;	within	a	month	,	like	most	people	,	was	pain	-	free	,	and	within	a	year	,	climbing	more	than	100	floors	a	day	on	a	stairmaster	.
this	is	not	unusual	,	and	it	's	part	of	what	enables	people	to	maintain	these	kinds	of	changes	,	because	it	makes	such	a	big	difference	in	their	quality	of	life	.
overall	,	if	you	looked	at	all	the	arteries	in	all	the	patients	,	they	got	worse	and	worse	,	from	one	year	to	five	years	,	in	the	comparison	group	.
this	is	the	natural	history	of	heart	disease	,	but	it	's	really	not	natural	because	we	found	it	could	get	better	and	better	,	and	much	more	quickly	than	people	had	once	thought	.
we	also	found	that	the	more	people	change	,	the	better	they	got	.
it	was	n't	a	function	of	how	old	or	how	sick	they	were	--	it	was	mainly	how	much	they	changed	,	and	the	oldest	patients	improved	as	much	as	the	young	ones	.
i	got	this	as	a	christmas	card	a	few	years	ago	from	two	of	the	patients	in	one	of	our	programs	.
the	younger	brother	is	86	,	the	older	one	's	95	;	they	wanted	to	show	me	how	much	more	flexible	they	were	.
and	the	following	year	they	sent	me	this	one	,	which	i	thought	was	kind	of	funny	.
you	just	never	know	.
and	what	we	found	was	that	99	percent	of	the	patients	start	to	reverse	the	progression	of	their	heart	disease	.
now	i	thought	,	you	know	,	if	we	just	did	good	science	,	that	would	change	medical	practice	.	but	,	that	was	a	little	naive	.
it	's	important	,	but	not	enough	.
because	we	doctors	do	what	we	get	paid	to	do	,	and	we	get	trained	to	do	what	we	get	paid	to	do	,	so	if	we	change	insurance	,	then	we	change	medical	practice	and	medical	education	.
insurance	will	cover	the	bypass	,	it	'll	cover	the	angioplasty	;	it	wo	n't	,	until	recently	,	cover	diet	and	lifestyle	.
so	,	we	began	through	our	nonprofit	institute	's	training	hospitals	around	the	country	,	and	we	found	that	most	people	could	avoid	surgery	,	and	not	only	was	it	medically	effective	,	it	was	also	cost	effective	.
and	the	insurance	companies	found	that	they	began	to	save	almost	30,000	dollars	per	patient	,	and	medicare	is	now	in	the	middle	of	doing	a	demonstration	project	where	they	're	paying	for	1,800	people	to	go	through	the	program	on	the	sites	that	we	train	.
the	fortuneteller	says	,	``	i	give	smokers	a	discount	because	there	's	not	as	much	to	tell	.	``
i	like	this	slide	,	because	it	's	a	chance	to	talk	about	what	really	motivates	people	to	change	,	and	what	does	n't	.
and	what	does	n't	work	is	fear	of	dying	,	and	that	's	what	's	normally	used	.
everybody	who	smokes	knows	it	's	not	good	for	you	,	and	still	30	percent	of	americans	smoke	--	80	percent	in	some	parts	of	the	world	.	why	do	people	do	it	?
well	,	because	it	helps	them	get	through	the	day	.
and	i	'll	talk	more	about	this	,	but	the	real	epidemic	is	n't	just	heart	disease	or	obesity	or	smoking	--	it	's	loneliness	and	depression	.
as	one	woman	said	,	``	i	've	got	20	friends	in	this	package	of	cigarettes	,	and	they	're	always	there	for	me	and	nobody	else	is	.
you	're	going	to	take	away	my	20	friends	?	what	are	you	going	to	give	me	?	``
or	they	eat	when	they	get	depressed	,	or	they	use	alcohol	to	numb	the	pain	,	or	they	work	too	hard	,	or	watch	too	much	tv	.
there	are	lots	of	ways	we	have	of	avoiding	and	numbing	and	bypassing	pain	,	but	the	point	of	all	of	this	is	to	deal	with	the	cause	of	the	problem	.
and	the	pain	is	not	the	problem	:	it	's	the	symptom	.
and	telling	people	they	're	going	to	die	is	too	scary	to	think	about	,	or	,	they	're	going	to	get	emphysema	or	heart	attack	is	too	scary	,	and	so	they	do	n't	want	to	think	about	it	,	so	they	do	n't	.
the	most	effective	anti	-	smoking	ad	was	this	one	.
you	'll	notice	the	limp	cigarette	hanging	out	of	his	mouth	,	and	``	impotence	``	--	the	headline	is	,	``	impotent	``	--	it	's	not	emphysema	.
what	was	the	biggest	selling	drug	of	all	time	when	it	was	introduced	a	few	years	ago	?
viagra	,	right	?	why	?	because	a	lot	of	guys	need	it	.
it	's	not	like	you	say	,	``	hey	joe	,	i	'm	having	erectile	dysfunction	,	how	about	you	?	``
and	yet	,	look	at	the	number	of	prescriptions	that	are	being	sold	.
it	's	not	so	much	psychological	,	it	's	vascular	,	and	nicotine	makes	your	arteries	constrict	.
so	does	cocaine	,	so	does	a	high	fat	diet	,	so	does	emotional	stress	.
so	the	very	behaviors	that	we	think	of	as	being	so	sexy	in	our	culture	are	the	very	ones	that	leave	so	many	people	feeling	tired	,	lethargic	,	depressed	and	impotent	,	and	that	's	not	much	fun	.
but	when	you	change	those	behaviors	,	your	brain	gets	more	blood	,	you	think	more	clearly	,	you	have	more	energy	,	your	heart	gets	more	blood	in	ways	i	've	shown	you	.
your	sexual	function	improves	.
and	these	things	occur	within	hours	.	this	is	a	study	:	a	high	fat	meal	,	and	within	one	or	two	hours	blood	-	flow	is	measurably	less	--	and	you	've	all	experienced	this	at	thanksgiving	.
when	you	eat	a	big	fatty	meal	,	how	do	you	feel	?
you	feel	kind	of	sleepy	afterwards	.
on	a	low	-	fat	meal	,	the	blood	flow	does	n't	go	down	--	it	even	goes	up	.
many	of	you	have	kids	,	and	you	know	that	's	a	big	change	in	your	lifestyle	,	and	so	people	are	not	afraid	to	make	big	changes	in	lifestyle	if	they	're	worth	it	.
and	the	paradox	is	that	when	you	make	big	changes	,	you	get	big	benefits	,	and	you	feel	so	much	better	so	quickly	.
for	many	people	,	those	are	choices	worth	making	--	not	to	live	longer	,	but	to	live	better	.
i	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	the	obesity	epidemic	,	because	it	really	is	a	problem	.
two	-	thirds	of	adults	are	overweight	or	obese	,	and	diabetes	in	kids	and	30	-	year	-	olds	has	increased	70	percent	in	the	last	10	years	.	it	's	no	joke	:	it	's	real	.
and	just	to	show	you	this	,	this	is	from	the	cdc	.
these	are	not	election	returns	;	these	are	the	percentage	of	people	who	are	overweight	.
and	if	you	see	from	'85	to	'86	to	'87	,	'88	,	'89	,	'90	,	'91	--	you	get	a	new	category	,	15	to	20	percent	;	'92	,	'93	,	'94	,	'95	,	'96	,	'97	--	you	get	a	new	category	;	'98	,	'99	,	2000	,	and	2001	.
mississippi	,	more	than	25	percent	of	people	are	overweight	.
why	is	this	?	well	,	this	is	one	way	to	lose	weight	that	works	very	well	...
but	it	does	n't	last	,	which	is	the	problem	.
now	,	there	's	no	mystery	in	how	you	lose	weight	;	you	either	burn	more	calories	by	exercise	or	you	eat	fewer	calories	.
now	,	one	way	to	eat	fewer	calories	is	to	eat	less	food	,	which	is	why	you	can	lose	weight	on	any	diet	if	you	eat	less	food	,	or	if	you	restrict	entire	categories	of	foods	.
but	the	problem	is	,	you	get	hungry	,	so	it	's	hard	to	keep	it	off	.
the	other	way	is	to	change	the	type	of	food	.
and	fat	has	nine	calories	per	gram	,	whereas	protein	and	carbs	only	have	four	.
so	,	when	you	eat	less	fat	,	you	eat	fewer	calories	without	having	to	eat	less	food	.
so	you	can	eat	the	same	amount	of	food	,	but	you	'll	be	getting	fewer	calories	because	the	food	is	less	dense	in	calories	.
and	it	's	the	volume	of	food	that	affects	satiety	,	rather	than	the	type	of	food	.
you	know	,	i	do	n't	like	talking	about	the	atkins	diet	,	but	i	get	asked	about	it	every	day	,	and	so	i	just	thought	i	'd	spend	a	few	minutes	on	that	.
the	myth	that	you	hear	about	is	,	americans	have	been	told	to	eat	less	fat	,	the	percent	of	calories	from	fat	is	down	,	americans	are	fatter	than	ever	,	therefore	fat	does	n't	make	you	fat	.
it	's	a	half	-	truth	.	actually	,	americans	are	eating	more	fat	than	ever	,	and	even	more	carbs	.	and	so	the	percentage	is	lower	,	the	actual	amount	is	higher	,	and	so	the	goal	is	to	reduce	both	.
dr.	atkins	and	i	debated	each	other	many	times	before	he	died	,	and	we	agreed	that	americans	eat	too	many	simple	carbs	,	the	``	bad	carbs	,	``	and	these	are	things	like	--	--	sugar	,	white	flour	,	white	rice	,	alcohol	.	and	you	get	a	double	whammy	:	you	get	all	these	calories	that	do	n't	fill	you	up	because	you	've	removed	the	fiber	,	and	they	get	absorbed	quickly	so	your	blood	sugar	zooms	up	.
your	pancreas	makes	insulin	to	bring	it	back	down	,	which	is	good	.
but	insulin	accelerates	the	conversion	of	calories	into	fat	.
so	,	the	goal	is	not	to	go	to	pork	rinds	and	bacon	and	sausages	--	these	are	not	health	foods	--	but	to	go	from	``	bad	carbs	``	to	what	are	called	``	good	carbs	.	``
and	these	are	things	like	whole	foods	,	or	unrefined	carbs	:	fruits	,	vegetables	,	whole	wheat	flour	,	brown	rice	,	in	their	natural	forms	,	are	rich	in	fiber	.
and	the	fiber	fills	you	up	before	you	get	too	many	calories	,	and	it	slows	the	absorption	so	you	do	n't	get	that	rapid	rise	in	blood	sugar	.
so	,	and	you	get	all	the	disease	-	protective	substances	.
it	's	not	just	what	you	exclude	from	your	diet	,	but	also	what	you	include	that	's	protective	.
just	as	all	carbs	are	not	bad	for	you	,	all	fats	are	not	bad	for	you	.	there	are	good	fats	.
and	these	are	predominantly	what	are	called	the	omega	-	3	fatty	acids	.
you	find	these	,	for	example	,	in	fish	oil	.
and	the	bad	fats	are	things	like	trans	-	fatty	acids	and	processed	food	and	saturated	fats	,	which	we	find	in	meat	.
if	you	do	n't	remember	anything	else	from	this	talk	,	three	grams	a	day	of	fish	oil	can	reduce	your	risk	of	a	heart	attack	and	sudden	death	by	50	to	80	percent	.
three	grams	a	day	.	they	come	in	one	-	gram	capsules	;	more	than	that	just	gives	you	extra	fat	you	do	n't	need	.
it	also	helps	reduce	the	risk	of	the	most	common	cancers	like	breast	,	prostate	and	colon	cancer	.
now	,	the	problem	with	the	atkins	diet	,	everybody	knows	people	who	have	lost	weight	on	it	,	but	you	can	lose	weight	on	amphetamines	,	you	know	,	and	fen	-	phen	.
i	mean	,	there	are	lots	of	ways	of	losing	weight	that	are	n't	good	for	you	.
you	want	to	lose	weight	in	a	way	that	enhances	your	health	rather	than	the	one	that	harms	it	.
and	the	problem	is	that	it	's	based	on	this	half	-	truth	,	which	is	that	americans	eat	too	many	simple	carbs	,	so	if	you	eat	fewer	simple	carbs	you	're	going	to	lose	weight	.
you	'll	lose	even	more	weight	if	you	go	to	whole	foods	and	less	fat	,	and	you	'll	enhance	your	health	rather	than	harming	it	.
he	says	,	``	i	've	got	some	good	news	.
while	your	cholesterol	level	has	remained	the	same	,	the	research	findings	have	changed	.	``
now	,	what	happens	to	your	heart	when	you	go	on	an	atkins	diet	?
the	red	is	good	at	the	beginning	,	and	a	year	later	--	this	is	from	a	study	done	in	a	peer	-	reviewed	journal	called	angiology	--	there	's	more	red	after	a	year	on	a	diet	like	i	would	recommend	,	there	's	less	red	,	less	blood	flow	after	a	year	on	an	atkins	-	type	diet	.
so	,	yes	,	you	can	lose	weight	,	but	your	heart	is	n't	happy	.
now	,	one	of	the	studies	funded	by	the	atkins	center	found	that	70	percent	of	the	people	were	constipated	,	65	percent	had	bad	breath	,	54	percent	had	headaches	--	this	is	not	a	healthy	way	to	eat	.
and	so	,	you	might	start	to	lose	weight	and	start	to	attract	people	towards	you	,	but	when	they	get	too	close	it	's	going	to	be	a	problem	.
and	more	seriously	,	there	are	case	reports	now	of	16	-	year	-	old	girls	who	died	after	a	few	weeks	on	the	atkins	diet	--	of	bone	disease	,	kidney	disease	,	and	so	on	.
and	that	's	how	your	body	excretes	waste	,	is	through	your	breath	,	your	bowels	and	your	perspiration	.
so	when	you	go	on	these	kinds	of	diet	,	they	begin	to	smell	bad	.
so	,	an	optimal	diet	is	low	in	fat	,	low	in	the	bad	carbs	,	high	in	the	good	carbs	and	enough	of	the	good	fats	.
and	then	,	again	,	it	's	a	spectrum	:	when	you	move	in	this	direction	,	you	're	going	to	lose	weight	,	you	're	going	to	feel	better	and	you	're	going	to	gain	health	.
now	,	there	are	ecological	reasons	for	eating	lower	on	the	food	chain	too	,	whether	it	's	the	deforestation	of	the	amazon	,	or	making	more	protein	available	,	to	the	four	billion	people	who	live	on	a	dollar	a	day	--	not	to	mention	whatever	ethical	concerns	people	have	.
so	,	there	are	lots	of	reasons	for	eating	this	way	that	go	beyond	just	your	health	.
now	,	we	're	about	to	publish	the	first	study	looking	at	the	effects	of	this	program	on	prostate	cancer	,	and	,	in	collaboration	with	sloane	-	kettering	and	with	ucsf	.
we	took	90	men	who	had	biopsy	-	proven	prostate	cancer	and	who	had	elected	,	for	reasons	unrelated	to	the	study	,	not	to	have	surgery	.
we	could	randomly	divide	them	into	two	groups	,	and	then	we	could	have	one	group	that	is	a	non	-	intervention	control	group	to	compare	to	,	which	we	ca	n't	do	with	,	say	,	breast	cancer	,	because	everyone	gets	treated	.
what	we	found	was	that	,	after	a	year	,	none	of	the	experimental	group	patients	who	made	these	lifestyle	changes	needed	treatment	,	whereas	six	of	the	control	-	group	patients	needed	surgery	or	radiation	.
when	we	looked	at	their	psa	levels	--	which	is	a	marker	for	prostate	cancer	--	they	got	worse	in	the	control	group	,	but	they	actually	got	better	in	the	experimental	group	,	and	these	differences	were	highly	significant	.
and	then	i	wondered	:	was	there	any	relationship	between	how	much	people	changed	their	diet	and	lifestyle	--	whichever	group	they	were	in	--	and	the	changes	in	psa	?
and	sure	enough	,	we	found	a	dose	-	response	relationship	,	just	like	we	found	in	the	arterial	blockages	in	our	cardiac	studies	.
and	in	order	for	the	psa	to	go	down	,	they	had	to	make	pretty	big	changes	.
i	then	wondered	,	well	,	maybe	they	're	just	changing	their	psa	,	but	it	's	not	really	affecting	the	tumor	growth	.
so	we	took	some	of	their	blood	serum	and	sent	it	down	to	ucla	;	they	added	it	to	a	standard	line	of	prostate	tumor	cells	growing	in	tissue	culture	,	and	it	inhibited	the	growth	seven	times	more	in	the	experimental	group	than	in	the	control	group	--	70	versus	9	percent	.
and	finally	,	i	said	,	i	wonder	if	there	's	any	relationship	between	how	much	people	change	and	how	it	inhibited	their	tumor	growth	,	whichever	group	they	happened	to	be	in	.
and	this	really	got	me	excited	because	again	,	we	found	the	same	pattern	:	the	more	people	change	,	the	more	it	affected	the	growth	of	their	tumors	.
and	finally	,	we	did	mri	and	mr	spectroscopy	scans	on	some	of	these	patients	,	and	the	tumor	activity	is	shown	in	red	in	this	patient	,	and	you	can	see	clearly	it	's	better	a	year	later	,	along	with	the	psa	going	down	.
so	,	if	it	's	true	for	prostate	cancer	,	it	'll	almost	certainly	be	true	for	breast	cancer	as	well	.
and	whether	or	not	you	have	conventional	treatment	,	in	addition	,	if	you	make	these	changes	,	it	may	help	reduce	the	risk	of	recurrence	.
the	last	thing	i	want	to	talk	about	,	apropos	of	the	issue	of	the	pursuit	of	happiness	,	is	that	study	after	study	have	shown	that	people	who	are	lonely	and	depressed	--	and	depression	is	the	other	real	epidemic	in	our	culture	--	are	many	times	more	likely	to	get	sick	and	die	prematurely	,	in	part	because	,	as	we	talked	about	,	they	're	more	likely	to	smoke	and	overeat	and	drink	too	much	and	work	too	hard	and	so	on	.
but	also	,	through	mechanisms	that	we	do	n't	fully	understand	,	people	who	are	lonely	and	depressed	are	many	times	--	three	to	five	to	ten	times	,	in	some	studies	--	more	likely	to	get	sick	and	die	prematurely	.
and	depression	is	treatable	.	we	need	to	do	something	about	that	.
now	,	on	the	other	hand	,	anything	that	promotes	intimacy	is	healing	.
it	can	be	sexual	intimacy	--	i	happen	to	think	that	healing	energy	and	erotic	energy	are	just	different	forms	of	the	same	thing	.
friendship	,	altruism	,	compassion	,	service	--	all	the	perennial	truths	that	we	talked	about	that	are	part	of	all	religion	and	all	cultures	--	once	you	stop	trying	to	see	the	differences	,	these	are	the	things	in	our	own	self	-	interest	,	because	they	free	us	from	our	suffering	and	from	disease	.
and	it	's	in	a	sense	the	most	selfish	thing	that	we	can	do	.
just	take	a	look	at	one	study	.	this	was	done	by	david	spiegel	at	stanford	.
he	took	women	with	metastatic	breast	cancer	,	randomly	divided	them	into	two	groups	.
one	group	of	people	just	met	for	an	hour	-	and	-	a	-	half	once	a	week	in	a	support	group	.
it	was	a	nurturing	,	loving	environment	,	where	they	were	encouraged	to	let	down	their	emotional	defenses	and	talk	about	how	awful	it	is	to	have	breast	cancer	with	people	who	understood	,	because	they	were	going	through	it	too	.
they	just	met	once	a	week	for	a	year	.
five	years	later	,	those	women	lived	twice	as	long	,	and	you	can	see	that	the	people	--	and	that	was	the	only	difference	between	the	groups	.
it	was	a	randomized	control	study	published	in	the	lancet	.
other	studies	have	shown	this	as	well	.
so	,	these	simple	things	that	create	intimacy	are	really	healing	,	and	even	the	word	healing	,	it	comes	from	the	root	``	to	make	whole	.	``
the	word	yoga	comes	from	the	sanskrit	,	meaning	``	union	,	to	yoke	,	to	bring	together	.	``
and	the	last	slide	i	want	to	show	you	is	from	--	i	was	--	again	,	this	swami	that	i	studied	with	for	so	many	years	,	and	i	did	a	combined	oncology	and	cardiology	grand	rounds	at	the	university	of	virginia	medical	school	a	couple	of	years	ago	.
and	at	the	end	of	it	,	somebody	said	,	``	hey	,	swami	,	what	's	the	difference	between	wellness	and	illness	?	``
and	so	he	went	up	on	the	board	and	he	wrote	the	word	``	illness	,	``	and	circled	the	first	letter	,	and	then	wrote	the	word	``	wellness	,	``	and	circled	the	first	two	letters	...
to	me	,	it	's	just	shorthand	for	what	we	're	talking	about	:	that	anything	that	creates	a	sense	of	connection	and	community	and	love	is	really	healing	.
and	then	we	can	enjoy	our	lives	more	fully	without	getting	sick	in	the	process	.
thank	you	.
