i	moved	to	boston	10	years	ago	,	from	chicago	,	with	an	interest	in	cancer	and	in	chemistry	.
you	might	know	that	chemistry	is	the	science	of	making	molecules	--	or	to	my	taste	,	new	drugs	for	cancer	.
and	you	might	also	know	that	,	for	science	and	medicine	,	boston	is	a	bit	of	a	candy	store	.
you	ca	n't	roll	a	stop	sign	in	cambridge	without	hitting	a	graduate	student	.
the	bar	is	called	the	miracle	of	science	.
the	billboards	say	``	lab	space	available	.	``
and	it	's	fair	to	say	that	in	these	10	years	,	we	've	witnessed	absolutely	the	start	of	a	scientific	revolution	--	that	of	genome	medicine	.
we	know	more	about	the	patients	that	enter	our	clinic	now	than	ever	before	.
and	we	're	able	,	finally	,	to	answer	the	question	that	's	been	so	pressing	for	so	many	years	:	why	do	i	have	cancer	?
this	information	is	also	pretty	staggering	.
you	might	know	that	,	so	far	in	just	the	dawn	of	this	revolution	,	we	know	that	there	are	perhaps	40,000	unique	mutations	affecting	more	than	10,000	genes	,	and	that	there	are	500	of	these	genes	that	are	bona	-	fide	drivers	,	causes	of	cancer	.
yet	comparatively	,	we	have	about	a	dozen	targeted	medications	.
and	this	inadequacy	of	cancer	medicine	really	hit	home	when	my	father	was	diagnosed	with	pancreatic	cancer	.
we	did	n't	fly	him	to	boston	.
we	did	n't	sequence	his	genome	.
it	's	been	known	for	decades	what	causes	this	malignancy	.
it	's	three	proteins	--	ras	,	myc	and	p	53	.
this	is	old	information	we	've	known	since	about	the	80s	,	yet	there	's	no	medicine	i	can	prescribe	to	a	patient	with	this	or	any	of	the	numerous	solid	tumors	caused	by	these	three	horsemen	of	the	apocalypse	that	is	cancer	.
there	's	no	ras	,	no	myc	,	no	p	53	drug	.
and	you	might	fairly	ask	:	why	is	that	?
and	the	very	unsatisfying	,	yet	scientific	,	answer	is	it	's	too	hard	.
that	for	whatever	reason	,	these	three	proteins	have	entered	a	space	in	the	language	of	our	field	that	's	called	the	undruggable	genome	--	which	is	like	calling	a	computer	unsurfable	or	the	moon	unwalkable	.
it	's	a	horrible	term	of	trade	.
but	what	it	means	is	that	we	fail	to	identify	a	greasy	pocket	in	these	proteins	,	into	which	we	,	like	molecular	locksmiths	,	can	fashion	an	active	,	small	,	organic	molecule	or	drug	substance	.
now	as	i	was	training	in	clinical	medicine	and	hematology	and	oncology	and	stem	cell	transplantation	,	what	we	had	instead	,	cascading	through	the	regulatory	network	at	the	fda	,	were	these	substances	--	arsenic	,	thalidomide	and	this	chemical	derivative	of	nitrogen	mustard	gas	.
and	this	is	the	21st	century	.
and	so	,	i	guess	you	'd	say	,	dissatisfied	with	the	performance	and	quality	of	these	medicines	,	i	went	back	to	school	in	chemistry	with	the	idea	that	perhaps	by	learning	the	trade	of	discovery	chemistry	and	approaching	it	in	the	context	of	this	brave	new	world	of	the	open	-	source	,	the	crowd	-	source	,	the	collaborative	network	that	we	have	access	to	within	academia	,	that	we	might	more	quickly	bring	powerful	and	targeted	therapies	to	our	patients	.
and	so	please	consider	this	a	work	in	progress	,	but	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	today	a	story	about	a	very	rare	cancer	called	midline	carcinoma	,	about	the	protein	target	,	the	undruggable	protein	target	that	causes	this	cancer	,	called	brd	4	,	and	about	a	molecule	developed	at	my	lab	at	dana	farber	cancer	institute	called	jq	1	,	which	we	affectionately	named	for	jun	qi	,	the	chemist	that	made	this	molecule	.
now	brd	4	is	an	interesting	protein	.
you	might	ask	yourself	,	with	all	the	things	cancer	's	trying	to	do	to	kill	our	patient	,	how	does	it	remember	it	's	cancer	?
when	it	winds	up	its	genome	,	divides	into	two	cells	and	unwinds	again	,	why	does	it	not	turn	into	an	eye	,	into	a	liver	,	as	it	has	all	the	genes	necessary	to	do	this	?
it	remembers	that	it	's	cancer	.
and	the	reason	is	that	cancer	,	like	every	cell	in	the	body	,	places	little	molecular	bookmarks	,	little	post	-	it	notes	,	that	remind	the	cell	``	i	'm	cancer	;	i	should	keep	growing	.	``
and	those	post	-	it	notes	involve	this	and	other	proteins	of	its	class	--	so	-	called	bromodomains	.
so	we	developed	an	idea	,	a	rationale	,	that	perhaps	,	if	we	made	a	molecule	that	prevented	the	post	-	it	note	from	sticking	by	entering	into	the	little	pocket	at	the	base	of	this	spinning	protein	,	then	maybe	we	could	convince	cancer	cells	,	certainly	those	addicted	to	this	brd	4	protein	,	that	they	're	not	cancer	.
and	so	we	started	to	work	on	this	problem	.
we	developed	libraries	of	compounds	and	eventually	arrived	at	this	and	similar	substances	called	jq	1	.
now	not	being	a	drug	company	,	we	could	do	certain	things	,	we	had	certain	flexibilities	,	that	i	respect	that	a	pharmaceutical	industry	does	n't	have	.
we	just	started	mailing	it	to	our	friends	.
i	have	a	small	lab	.
we	thought	we	'd	just	send	it	to	people	and	see	how	the	molecule	behaves	.
and	we	sent	it	to	oxford	,	england	where	a	group	of	talented	crystallographers	provided	this	picture	,	which	helped	us	understand	exactly	how	this	molecule	is	so	potent	for	this	protein	target	.
it	's	what	we	call	a	perfect	fit	of	shape	complimentarity	,	or	hand	in	glove	.
now	this	is	a	very	rare	cancer	,	this	brd	4	-	addicted	cancer	.
and	so	we	worked	with	samples	of	material	that	were	collected	by	young	pathologists	at	brigham	women	's	hospital	.
and	as	we	treated	these	cells	with	this	molecule	,	we	observed	something	really	striking	.
the	cancer	cells	,	small	,	round	and	rapidly	dividing	,	grew	these	arms	and	extensions	.
they	were	changing	shape	.
in	effect	,	the	cancer	cell	was	forgetting	it	was	cancer	and	becoming	a	normal	cell	.
this	got	us	very	excited	.
the	next	step	would	be	to	put	this	molecule	into	mice	.
the	only	problem	was	there	's	no	mouse	model	of	this	rare	cancer	.
and	so	at	the	time	that	we	were	doing	this	research	,	i	was	caring	for	a	29	year	-	old	firefighter	from	connecticut	who	was	very	much	at	the	end	of	life	with	this	incurable	cancer	.
this	brd	4	-	addicted	cancer	was	growing	throughout	his	left	lung	,	and	he	had	a	chest	tube	in	that	was	draining	little	bits	of	debris	.
and	every	nursing	shift	we	would	throw	this	material	out	.
and	so	we	approached	this	patient	and	asked	if	he	would	collaborate	with	us	.
could	we	take	this	precious	and	rare	cancerous	material	from	this	chest	tube	and	drive	it	across	town	and	put	it	into	mice	and	try	to	do	a	clinical	trial	and	stage	it	with	a	prototype	drug	?
well	that	would	be	impossible	and	,	rightly	,	illegal	to	do	in	humans	.
and	he	obliged	us	.
at	the	lurie	family	center	for	animal	imaging	,	my	colleague	,	andrew	kung	,	grew	this	cancer	successfully	in	mice	without	ever	touching	plastic	.
and	you	can	see	this	pet	scan	of	a	mouse	--	what	we	call	a	pet	pet	.
the	cancer	is	growing	as	this	red	,	huge	mass	in	the	hind	limb	of	this	animal	.
and	as	we	treat	it	with	our	compound	,	this	addiction	to	sugar	,	this	rapid	growth	,	faded	.
and	on	the	animal	on	the	right	,	you	see	that	the	cancer	was	responding	.
we	've	completed	now	clinical	trials	in	four	mouse	models	of	this	disease	.
and	every	time	,	we	see	the	same	thing	.
the	mice	with	this	cancer	that	get	the	drug	live	,	and	the	ones	that	do	n't	rapidly	perish	.
so	we	started	to	wonder	,	what	would	a	drug	company	do	at	this	point	?
well	they	probably	would	keep	this	a	secret	until	they	turn	a	prototype	drug	into	an	active	pharmaceutical	substance	.
and	so	we	did	just	the	opposite	.
we	published	a	paper	that	described	this	finding	at	the	earliest	prototype	stage	.
we	gave	the	world	the	chemical	identity	of	this	molecule	,	typically	a	secret	in	our	discipline	.
we	told	people	exactly	how	to	make	it	.
we	gave	them	our	email	address	,	suggesting	that	,	if	they	write	us	,	we	'll	send	them	a	free	molecule	.
we	basically	tried	to	create	the	most	competitive	environment	for	our	lab	as	possible	.
and	this	was	,	unfortunately	,	successful	.
because	now	when	we	've	shared	this	molecule	,	just	since	december	of	last	year	,	with	40	laboratories	in	the	united	states	and	30	more	in	europe	--	many	of	them	pharmaceutical	companies	seeking	now	to	enter	this	space	,	to	target	this	rare	cancer	that	,	thankfully	right	now	,	is	quite	desirable	to	study	in	that	industry	.
but	the	science	that	's	coming	back	from	all	of	these	laboratories	about	the	use	of	this	molecule	has	provided	us	insights	that	we	might	not	have	had	on	our	own	.
leukemia	cells	treated	with	this	compound	turn	into	normal	white	blood	cells	.
mice	with	multiple	myeloma	,	an	incurable	malignancy	of	the	bone	marrow	,	respond	dramatically	to	the	treatment	with	this	drug	.
you	might	know	that	fat	has	memory	.
nice	to	be	able	to	demonstrate	that	for	you	.
and	in	fact	,	this	molecule	prevents	this	adipocyte	,	this	fat	stem	cell	,	from	remembering	how	to	make	fat	such	that	mice	on	a	high	fat	diet	,	like	the	folks	in	my	hometown	of	chicago	,	fail	to	develop	fatty	liver	,	which	is	a	major	medical	problem	.
what	this	research	taught	us	--	not	just	my	lab	,	but	our	institute	,	and	harvard	medical	school	more	generally	--	is	that	we	have	unique	resources	in	academia	for	drug	discovery	--	that	our	center	that	has	tested	perhaps	more	cancer	molecules	in	a	scientific	way	than	any	other	,	never	made	one	of	its	own	.
for	all	the	reasons	you	see	listed	here	,	we	think	there	's	a	great	opportunity	for	academic	centers	to	participate	in	this	earliest	,	conceptually	-	tricky	and	creative	discipline	of	prototype	drug	discovery	.
so	what	next	?
we	have	this	molecule	,	but	it	's	not	a	pill	yet	.
it	's	not	orally	available	.
we	need	to	fix	it	,	so	that	we	can	deliver	it	to	our	patients	.
and	everyone	in	the	lab	,	especially	following	the	interaction	with	these	patients	,	feels	quite	compelled	to	deliver	a	drug	substance	based	on	this	molecule	.
it	's	here	where	i	have	to	say	that	we	could	use	your	help	and	your	insights	,	your	collaborative	participation	.
unlike	a	drug	company	,	we	do	n't	have	a	pipeline	that	we	can	deposit	these	molecules	into	.
we	do	n't	have	a	team	of	salespeople	and	marketeers	that	can	tell	us	how	to	position	this	drug	against	the	other	.
what	we	do	have	is	the	flexibility	of	an	academic	center	to	work	with	competent	,	motivated	,	enthusiastic	,	hopefully	well	-	funded	people	to	carry	these	molecules	forward	into	the	clinic	while	preserving	our	ability	to	share	the	prototype	drug	worldwide	.
this	molecule	will	soon	leave	our	benches	and	go	into	a	small	startup	company	called	tensha	therapeutics	.
and	really	this	is	the	fourth	of	these	molecules	to	kind	of	graduate	from	our	little	pipeline	of	drug	discovery	,	two	of	which	--	a	topical	drug	for	lymphoma	of	the	skin	,	an	oral	substance	for	the	treatment	of	multiple	myeloma	--	will	actually	come	to	the	bedside	for	first	clinical	trial	in	july	of	this	year	.
for	us	,	a	major	and	exciting	milestone	.
i	want	to	leave	you	with	just	two	ideas	.
the	first	is	if	anything	is	unique	about	this	research	,	it	's	less	the	science	than	the	strategy	--	that	this	for	us	was	a	social	experiment	,	an	experiment	in	what	would	happen	if	we	were	as	open	and	honest	at	the	earliest	phase	of	discovery	chemistry	research	as	we	could	be	.
this	string	of	letters	and	numbers	and	symbols	and	parentheses	that	can	be	texted	,	i	suppose	,	or	twittered	worldwide	,	is	the	chemical	identity	of	our	pro	compound	.
it	's	the	information	that	we	most	need	from	pharmaceutical	companies	,	the	information	on	how	these	early	prototype	drugs	might	work	.
yet	this	information	is	largely	a	secret	.
and	so	we	seek	really	to	download	from	the	amazing	successes	of	the	computer	science	industry	two	principles	:	that	of	opensource	and	that	of	crowdsourcing	to	quickly	,	responsibly	accelerate	the	delivery	of	targeted	therapeutics	to	patients	with	cancer	.
now	the	business	model	involves	all	of	you	.
this	research	is	funded	by	the	public	.
it	's	funded	by	foundations	.
and	one	thing	i	've	learned	in	boston	is	that	you	people	will	do	anything	for	cancer	--	and	i	love	that	.
you	bike	across	the	state	.	you	walk	up	and	down	the	river	.
i	've	never	seen	really	anywhere	this	unique	support	for	cancer	research	.
and	so	i	want	to	thank	you	for	your	participation	,	your	collaboration	and	most	of	all	for	your	confidence	in	our	ideas	.
