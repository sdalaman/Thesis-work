this	technology	made	a	very	important	impact	on	us	.
it	changed	the	way	our	history	developed	.
but	it	's	a	technology	so	pervasive	,	so	invisible	,	that	we	,	for	a	long	time	,	forgot	to	take	it	into	account	when	we	talked	about	human	evolution	.
but	we	see	the	results	of	this	technology	,	still	.
so	let	's	make	a	little	test	.
so	everyone	of	you	turns	to	their	neighbor	please	.
turn	and	face	your	neighbors	.
please	,	also	on	the	balcony	.
smile	.	smile	.	open	the	mouths	.
smile	,	friendly	.
do	you	--	do	you	see	any	canine	teeth	?
count	dracula	teeth	in	the	mouths	of	your	neighbors	?
of	course	not	.
because	our	dental	anatomy	is	actually	made	,	not	for	tearing	down	raw	meat	from	bones	or	chewing	fibrous	leaves	for	hours	.
it	is	made	for	a	diet	which	is	soft	,	mushy	,	which	is	reduced	in	fibers	,	which	is	very	easily	chewable	and	digestible	.
sounds	like	fast	food	,	does	n't	it	.
it	's	for	cooked	food	.
we	carry	in	our	face	the	proof	that	cooking	,	food	transformation	,	made	us	what	we	are	.
so	i	would	suggest	that	we	change	how	we	classify	ourselves	.
we	talk	about	ourselves	as	omnivores	.
i	would	say	,	we	should	call	ourselves	coctivors	--	from	coquere	,	to	cook	.
we	are	the	animals	who	eat	cooked	food	.
no	,	no	,	no	,	no	.	better	--	to	live	of	cooked	food	.
so	cooking	is	a	very	important	technology	.
it	's	technology	.
i	do	n't	know	how	you	feel	,	but	i	like	to	cook	for	entertainment	.
and	you	need	some	design	to	be	successful	.
so	,	cooking	is	a	very	important	technology	,	because	it	allowed	us	to	acquire	what	brought	you	all	here	:	the	big	brain	,	this	wonderful	cerebral	cortex	we	have	.
because	brains	are	expensive	.
those	have	to	pay	tuition	fees	know	.
but	it	's	also	,	metabolically	speaking	,	expensive	.
you	now	,	our	brain	is	two	to	three	percent	of	the	body	mass	,	but	actually	it	uses	25	percent	of	the	total	energy	we	use	.
it	's	very	expensive	.
where	does	the	energy	come	from	.	of	course	,	from	food	.
if	we	eat	raw	food	,	we	can	not	release	really	the	energy	.
so	this	ingenuity	of	our	ancestors	,	to	invent	this	most	marvelous	technology	.
invisible	--	everyone	of	us	does	it	every	day	,	so	to	speak	.
cooking	made	it	possible	that	mutations	,	natural	selections	,	our	environment	,	could	develop	us	.
so	if	we	think	about	this	unleashing	human	potential	,	which	was	possible	by	cooking	and	food	,	why	do	we	talk	so	badly	about	food	?
why	is	it	always	do	and	don'ts	and	it	's	good	for	you	,	it	's	not	good	for	you	?
i	think	the	good	news	for	me	would	be	if	we	could	go	back	and	talk	about	the	unleashing	,	the	continuation	of	the	unleashing	of	human	potential	.
now	,	cooking	allowed	also	that	we	became	a	migrant	species	.
we	walked	out	of	africa	two	times	.
we	populated	all	the	ecologies	.
if	you	can	cook	,	nothing	can	happen	to	you	,	because	whatever	you	find	,	you	will	try	to	transform	it	.
it	keeps	also	your	brain	working	.
now	the	very	easy	and	simple	technology	which	was	developed	actually	runs	after	this	formula	.
take	something	which	looks	like	food	,	transform	it	,	and	it	gives	you	a	good	,	very	easy	,	accessible	energy	.
this	technology	affected	two	organs	,	the	brain	and	the	gut	,	which	it	actually	affected	.
the	brain	could	grow	,	but	the	gut	actually	shrunk	.
okay	,	it	's	not	obvious	to	be	honest	.
but	it	shrunk	to	60	percent	of	primate	gut	of	my	body	mass	.
so	because	of	having	cooked	food	,	it	's	easier	to	digest	.
now	having	a	large	brain	,	as	you	know	,	is	a	big	advantage	,	because	you	can	actually	influence	your	environment	.
you	can	influence	your	own	technologies	you	have	invented	.
you	can	continue	to	innovate	and	invent	.
now	the	big	brain	did	this	also	with	cooking	.
but	how	did	it	actually	run	this	show	?
how	did	it	actually	interfere	?
what	kind	of	criteria	did	it	use	?
and	this	is	actually	taste	reward	and	energy	.
you	know	we	have	up	to	five	tastes	,	three	of	them	sustain	us	.
sweet	--	energy	.
umami	--	this	is	a	meaty	taste	.
you	need	proteins	for	muscles	,	recovery	.
salty	,	because	you	need	salt	,	otherwise	your	electric	body	will	not	work	.
and	two	tastes	which	protect	you	--	bitter	and	sour	,	which	are	against	poisonous	and	rotten	material	.
but	of	course	,	they	are	hard	-	wired	but	we	use	them	still	in	a	sophisticated	way	.
think	about	bittersweet	chocolate	;	or	think	about	the	acidity	of	yogurt	--	wonderful	--	mixed	with	strawberry	fruits	.
so	we	can	make	mixtures	of	all	this	kind	of	thing	because	we	know	that	,	in	cooking	,	we	can	transform	it	to	the	form	.
reward	:	this	is	a	more	complex	and	especially	integrative	form	of	our	brain	with	various	different	elements	--	the	external	states	,	our	internal	states	,	how	do	we	feel	,	and	so	on	are	put	together	.
and	something	which	maybe	you	do	n't	like	but	you	are	so	hungry	that	you	really	will	be	satisfied	to	eat	.
so	satisfaction	was	a	very	important	part	.
and	as	i	say	,	energy	was	necessary	.
now	how	did	the	gut	actually	participate	in	this	development	?
and	the	gut	is	a	silent	voice	--	it	's	going	more	for	feelings	.
i	use	the	euphemism	digestive	comfort	--	actually	--	it	's	a	digestive	discomfort	,	which	the	gut	is	concerned	with	.
if	you	get	a	stomach	ache	,	if	you	get	a	little	bit	bloated	,	was	not	the	right	food	,	was	not	the	right	cooking	manipulation	or	maybe	other	things	went	wrong	.
so	my	story	is	a	tale	of	two	brains	,	because	it	might	surprise	you	,	our	gut	has	a	full	-	fledged	brain	.
all	the	managers	in	the	room	say	,	``	you	do	n't	tell	me	something	new	,	because	we	know	,	gut	feeling	.
this	is	what	we	are	using	.	``
and	actually	you	use	it	and	it	's	actually	useful	.
because	our	gut	is	connected	to	our	emotional	limbic	system	,	they	do	speak	with	each	other	and	make	decisions	.
but	what	it	means	to	have	a	brain	there	is	that	,	not	only	the	big	brain	has	to	talk	with	the	food	,	the	food	has	to	talk	with	the	brain	,	because	we	have	to	learn	actually	how	to	talk	to	the	brains	.
now	if	there	's	a	gut	brain	,	we	should	also	learn	to	talk	with	this	brain	.
now	150	years	ago	,	anatomists	described	very	,	very	carefully	--	here	is	a	model	of	a	wall	of	a	gut	.
i	took	the	three	elements	--	stomach	,	small	intestine	and	colon	.
and	within	this	structure	,	you	see	these	two	pinkish	layers	,	which	are	actually	the	muscle	.
and	between	this	muscle	,	they	found	nervous	tissues	,	a	lot	of	nervous	tissues	,	which	penetrate	actually	the	muscle	--	penetrate	the	submucosa	,	where	you	have	all	the	elements	for	the	immune	system	.
the	gut	is	actually	the	largest	immune	system	,	defending	your	body	.
it	penetrates	the	mucosa	.
this	is	the	layer	which	actually	touches	the	food	you	are	swallowing	and	you	digest	,	which	is	actually	the	lumen	.
now	if	you	think	about	the	gut	,	the	gut	is	--	if	you	could	stretch	it	--	40	meters	long	,	the	length	of	a	tennis	court	.
if	we	could	unroll	it	,	get	out	all	the	folds	and	so	on	,	it	would	have	400	sq	.	meters	of	surface	.
and	now	this	brain	takes	care	over	this	,	to	move	it	with	the	muscles	and	to	do	defend	the	surface	and	,	of	course	,	digest	our	food	we	cook	.
so	if	we	give	you	a	specification	,	this	brain	,	which	is	autonomous	,	have	500	million	nerve	cells	,	100	million	neurons	--	so	around	the	size	of	a	cat	brain	,	so	there	sleeps	a	little	cat	--	thinks	for	itself	,	optimizes	whatever	it	digests	.
it	has	20	different	neuron	types	.
it	's	got	the	same	diversity	you	find	actually	in	a	pig	brain	,	where	you	have	100	billion	neurons	.
it	has	autonomous	organized	microcircuits	,	has	these	programs	which	run	.
it	senses	the	food	;	it	knows	exactly	what	to	do	.
it	senses	it	by	chemical	means	and	very	importantly	by	mechanical	means	,	because	it	has	to	move	the	food	--	it	has	to	mix	all	the	various	elements	which	we	need	for	digestion	.
this	control	of	muscle	is	very	,	very	important	,	because	,	you	know	,	there	can	be	reflexes	.
if	you	do	n't	like	a	food	,	especially	if	you	're	a	child	,	you	gag	.
it	's	this	brain	which	makes	this	reflex	.
and	then	finally	,	it	controls	also	the	secretion	of	this	molecular	machinery	,	which	actually	digests	the	food	we	cook	.
now	how	do	the	two	brains	work	with	each	other	?
i	took	here	a	model	from	robotics	--	it	's	called	the	subsumption	architecture	.
what	it	means	is	that	we	have	a	layered	control	system	.
the	lower	layer	,	our	gut	brain	,	has	its	own	goals	--	digestion	defense	--	and	we	have	the	higher	brain	with	the	goal	of	integration	and	generating	behaviors	.
now	both	look	--	and	this	is	the	blue	arrows	--	both	look	to	the	same	food	,	which	is	in	the	lumen	and	in	the	area	of	your	intestine	.
the	big	brain	integrates	signals	,	which	come	from	the	running	programs	of	the	lower	brain	,	but	subsumption	means	that	the	higher	brain	can	interfere	with	the	lower	.
it	can	replace	,	or	it	can	inhibit	actually	,	signals	.
so	if	we	take	two	types	of	signals	--	a	hunger	signal	for	example	.
if	you	have	an	empty	stomach	,	your	stomach	produces	a	hormone	called	ghrelin	.
it	's	a	very	big	signal	;	it	's	sent	to	the	brain	says	,	``	go	and	eat	.	``
you	have	stop	signals	--	we	have	up	to	eight	stop	signals	.
at	least	in	my	case	,	they	are	not	listened	to	.
so	what	happens	if	the	big	brain	in	the	integration	overrides	the	signal	?
so	if	you	override	the	hunger	signal	,	you	can	have	a	disorder	,	which	is	called	anorexia	.
despite	generating	a	healthy	hunger	signal	,	the	big	brain	ignores	it	and	activates	different	programs	in	the	gut	.
the	more	usual	case	is	overeating	.
it	actually	takes	the	signal	and	changes	it	,	and	we	continue	,	even	[	though	]	our	eight	signals	would	say	,	``	stop	,	enough	.
we	have	transferred	enough	energy	.	``
now	the	interesting	thing	is	that	,	along	this	lower	layer	--	this	gut	--	the	signal	becomes	stronger	and	stronger	if	undigested	,	but	digestible	,	material	could	penetrate	.
this	we	found	from	bariatric	surgery	.
that	then	the	signal	would	be	very	,	very	high	.
so	now	back	to	the	cooking	question	and	back	to	the	design	.
we	have	learned	to	talk	to	the	big	brain	--	taste	and	reward	,	as	you	know	.
now	what	would	be	the	language	we	have	to	talk	to	the	gut	brain	that	its	signals	are	so	strong	that	the	big	brain	can	not	ignore	it	?
then	we	would	generate	something	all	of	us	would	like	to	have	--	a	balance	between	the	hunger	and	the	satiation	.
now	i	give	you	,	from	our	research	,	a	very	short	claim	.
this	is	fat	digestion	.
you	have	on	your	left	an	olive	oil	droplet	,	and	this	olive	oil	droplet	gets	attacked	by	enzymes	.
this	is	an	in	vitro	experiment	.
it	's	very	difficult	to	work	in	the	intestine	.
now	everyone	would	expect	that	when	the	degradation	of	the	oil	happens	,	when	the	constituents	are	liberated	,	they	disappear	,	they	go	away	because	they	[	were	]	absorbed	.
actually	,	what	happens	is	that	a	very	intricate	structure	appears	.
and	i	hope	you	can	see	that	there	are	some	ring	-	like	structures	in	the	middle	image	,	which	is	water	.
this	whole	system	generates	a	huge	surface	to	allow	more	enzymes	to	attack	the	remaining	oil	.
and	finally	,	on	your	right	side	,	you	see	a	bubbly	,	cell	-	like	structure	appearing	,	from	which	the	body	will	absorb	the	fat	.
now	if	we	could	take	this	language	--	and	this	is	a	language	of	structures	--	and	make	it	longer	-	lasting	,	that	it	can	go	through	the	passage	of	the	intestine	,	it	would	generate	stronger	signals	.
so	our	research	--	and	i	think	the	research	also	at	the	universities	--	are	now	fixing	on	these	points	to	say	:	how	can	we	actually	--	and	this	might	sound	trivial	now	to	you	--	how	can	we	change	cooking	?
how	can	we	cook	that	we	have	this	language	developed	?
so	what	we	have	actually	,	it	's	not	an	omnivore	's	dilemma	.
we	have	a	coctivor	's	opportunity	,	because	we	have	learned	over	the	last	two	million	years	which	taste	and	reward	--	quite	sophisticated	to	cook	--	to	please	ourselves	,	to	satisfy	ourselves	.
if	we	add	the	matrix	,	if	we	add	the	structure	language	,	which	we	have	to	learn	,	when	we	learn	it	,	then	we	can	put	it	back	;	and	around	energy	,	we	could	generate	a	balance	,	which	comes	out	from	our	really	primordial	operation	:	cooking	.
so	,	to	make	cooking	really	a	very	important	element	,	i	would	say	even	philosophers	have	to	change	and	have	to	finally	recognize	that	cooking	is	what	made	us	.
so	i	would	say	,	coquo	ergo	sum	:	i	cook	,	therefore	i	am	.
thank	you	very	much	.
