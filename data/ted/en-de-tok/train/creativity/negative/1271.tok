text	:	jetman	-	yves	rossy	grand	canyon	narrator	:	many	of	the	tests	are	conducted	while	yves	is	strapped	onto	the	wing	,	because	yves	'	body	is	an	integral	part	of	the	aircraft	.
text	:	wind	tunnel	tests	narrator	:	the	wing	has	no	steering	controls	,	no	flaps	,	no	rudder	.
yves	uses	his	body	to	steer	the	wing	.
stefan	von	bergen	:	well	he	turns	by	just	putting	his	head	on	one	or	the	other	side	.
and	sometimes	he	assists	that	with	his	hands	,	sometimes	even	with	the	leg	.
he	's	acting	as	a	human	fuselage	,	so	to	say	.
and	that	's	quite	unique	.
narrator	:	when	he	arches	his	back	,	he	gains	altitude	.
when	he	pushes	his	shoulders	forward	,	he	goes	into	a	dive	.
text	:	swiss	alps	strait	of	gibraltar	crossing	english	channel	crossing	commentator	:	there	he	goes	.
there	is	yves	rossy	.
and	i	think	the	wing	is	open	,	the	wing	is	open	.
so	our	first	critical	moment	,	it	's	open	.
he	is	down	.	is	he	flying	?
commentator	two	:	it	looks	like	he	's	stabilized	.
he	's	starting	to	make	his	climb	.
commentator	:	there	's	that	90	degree	turn	you	're	talking	about	,	taking	him	out	.
he	's	out	over	the	channel	.
there	is	yves	rossy	.
there	is	no	turning	back	now	.
he	is	over	the	english	channel	and	underway	.
ladies	and	gentlemen	,	an	historic	flight	has	begun	.
commentator	two	:	and	what	he	's	going	to	do	as	he	approaches	the	ground	is	pull	down	on	those	toggles	to	flare	,	slow	himself	down	just	a	little	bit	,	and	then	come	in	for	a	nice	landing	.
commentator	:	there	he	is	.
yves	rossy	has	landed	in	england	.
bruno	giussani	:	and	now	he	's	in	edinburgh	.	yves	rossy	.
and	his	equipment	as	well	.
yves	,	welcome	.	it	is	quite	amazing	.
those	sequences	were	shot	over	the	last	three	years	in	various	moments	of	your	activities	.
and	there	were	many	,	many	others	.
so	it	's	possible	to	fly	almost	like	a	bird	.
what	is	it	[	like	]	to	be	up	there	?
yves	rossy	:	it	's	fun	.	it	's	fun	.
i	do	n't	have	feathers	.
but	i	feel	like	a	bird	sometimes	.
it	's	really	an	unreal	feeling	,	because	normally	you	have	a	big	thing	,	a	plane	,	around	you	.
and	when	i	strap	just	these	little	harnesses	,	this	little	wing	,	i	really	have	the	feeling	of	being	a	bird	.
bg	:	how	did	you	start	to	become	jetman	?
yr	:	it	was	about	20	years	ago	when	i	discovered	free	falling	.
when	you	go	out	of	an	airplane	you	are	almost	naked	.
you	take	a	position	like	that	.
and	especially	when	you	take	a	tracking	position	,	you	have	the	feeling	that	you	are	flying	.
and	that	's	the	nearest	thing	to	the	dream	.
you	have	no	machine	around	you	.
you	are	just	in	the	element	.
it	's	very	short	and	only	in	one	direction	.
so	the	idea	was	,	okay	,	keep	that	feeling	of	freedom	,	but	change	the	vector	and	increase	the	time	.
bg	:	so	i	'm	kind	of	curious	,	what	's	your	top	speed	?
yr	:	it	's	about	300	km	per	hour	before	looping	.
that	means	about	190	miles	per	hour	.
bg	:	and	what	's	the	weight	of	the	equipment	you	're	carrying	?
yr	:	when	i	exit	full	of	kerosene	,	i	'm	about	55	kilos	.
i	have	55	kilos	on	my	back	.
bg	:	and	you	're	not	piloting	?
there	is	no	handle	,	no	steering	nothing	?
it	is	purely	your	body	,	and	the	wings	become	part	of	the	body	and	vice	versa	?
yr	:	that	's	really	the	goal	,	because	if	you	put	[	in	]	steering	,	then	you	reinvent	the	airplane	.
and	i	wanted	to	keep	this	freedom	of	movement	.
and	it	's	really	like	the	kid	playing	the	airplane	.
i	want	to	go	down	like	that	.
and	up	i	climb	,	i	turn	.
it	's	really	pure	flying	.
it	's	not	steering	,	it	's	flight	.
bg	:	what	kind	of	training	do	you	do	,	you	personally	,	for	that	?
yr	:	actually	,	i	try	to	stay	just	fit	.
i	do	n't	do	special	physical	training	.
just	,	i	try	to	keep	my	mobility	through	new	activities	.
for	example	,	last	winter	i	began	with	kite	surfing	--	so	new	things	.
so	you	have	to	adapt	.
because	this	is	--	i	'm	quite	an	experienced	manager	of	systems	as	a	pilot	,	but	this	is	really	--	you	need	fluidity	,	you	need	to	be	agile	and	also	to	adapt	really	fast	.
bg	:	somebody	in	the	audience	asked	me	,	``	how	does	he	breathe	up	there	?	``
because	you	're	going	fast	and	you	're	up	3,000	meters	or	so	.
yr	:	okay	,	up	to	3,000	meters	,	it	's	not	such	a	big	problem	with	oxygen	.
but	for	example	,	bikers	,	they	have	the	same	speed	.
just	with	the	helmet	,	integral	helmet	,	it	's	really	no	problem	to	breathe	.
bg	:	describe	for	me	the	equipment	since	you	have	it	here	.
so	breitling	's	four	engines	.
yr	:	yeah	,	two	-	meter	span	.
ultrastable	profile	.
four	little	engines	,	22	kilos	thrust	each	,	turbines	working	with	kerosene	.
harness	,	parachute	.
my	only	instruments	are	[	an	]	altimeter	and	time	.
i	know	i	have	about	eight	minutes	fuel	.
so	just	check	before	it	's	finished	.
and	yeah	,	that	's	all	.
two	parachutes	.
that	means	,	if	i	have	a	problem	with	the	first	one	i	pull	,	i	still	have	the	possibility	to	open	the	second	one	.
and	this	is	my	life	.
that	's	the	real	important	thing	about	safety	.
i	did	use	that	during	these	last	15	years	about	20	times	--	never	with	that	type	of	wing	,	but	at	the	beginning	.
i	can	release	my	wing	when	i	am	in	a	spin	or	unstable	.
bg	:	we	saw	the	2009	crossing	of	the	gibraltar	strait	where	you	lost	control	and	then	you	dived	down	into	the	clouds	and	in	the	ocean	.
so	that	was	one	of	those	cases	where	you	let	the	wings	go	,	right	?
yr	:	yeah	.	i	did	try	in	[	the	]	clouds	,	but	you	lose	[	orientation	completely	]	.
so	i	did	try	to	take	,	again	,	a	climb	altitude	.
i	thought	,	okay	,	i	will	go	out	.
but	most	probably	i	did	something	like	that	.
bg	:	something	that	is	not	very	safe	in	image	.
yr	:	but	you	feel	great	,	but	you	have	not	the	right	altitude	.
so	the	next	thing	i	saw	was	just	blue	.
it	was	the	sea	.
i	have	also	an	audible	altimeter	.
so	i	was	at	my	minimum	altitude	in	that	vector	--	fast	--	so	i	pulled	that	.
and	then	i	did	open	my	chute	.
bg	:	so	the	wings	have	their	own	parachute	,	and	you	have	your	two	parachutes	.
yr	:	exactly	.	there	is	a	rescue	parachute	for	the	wing	for	two	reasons	:	so	i	can	repair	it	afterward	and	especially	so	nobody	takes	that	,	just	on	his	head	.
bg	:	i	see	.	maybe	come	back	here	.
this	is	risky	stuff	indeed	.
people	have	died	trying	to	do	this	kind	of	thing	.
and	you	do	n't	look	like	a	crazy	guy	;	you	're	a	swiss	airline	pilot	,	so	you	're	rather	a	checklist	kind	of	guy	.
i	assume	you	have	standards	.
yr	:	yeah	.	i	have	no	checklist	for	that	.
bg	:	let	's	not	tell	you	employer	.
yr	:	no	,	that	's	really	two	worlds	.
civil	aviation	is	something	that	we	know	very	well	.
we	have	a	hundred	years	of	experience	.
and	you	can	adapt	really	precisely	.
with	that	,	i	have	to	adapt	to	something	new	.
that	means	improvise	.
so	it	's	really	a	play	between	these	two	approaches	.
something	that	i	know	very	well	--	these	principles	,	for	example	,	we	have	two	engines	on	an	airbus	;	with	only	one	engine	,	you	can	fly	it	.
so	plan	b	,	always	a	plan	b	.
in	a	fighter	,	you	have	an	ejection	seat	.
that	's	my	ejection	seat	.
so	i	have	the	approach	of	a	professional	pilot	with	the	respect	of	a	pioneer	in	front	of	mother	nature	.
bg	:	it	's	well	said	.	it	's	well	said	.
what	happens	if	one	of	the	engines	stops	?
yr	:	i	do	a	roll	.
and	then	i	stabilize	,	and	according	to	my	altitude	,	i	continue	on	two	or	three	engines	.
it	's	sometimes	possible	--	it	's	quite	complicated	to	explain	--	but	according	to	which	regime	i	was	,	i	can	continue	on	two	and	try	to	get	a	nice	place	to	land	,	and	then	i	open	my	parachute	.
bg	:	so	the	beginning	of	the	flight	is	actually	you	jump	off	a	plane	or	a	helicopter	,	and	you	go	on	a	dive	and	accelerate	the	engines	,	and	then	you	basically	take	off	mid	-	air	somewhere	.
and	then	the	landing	,	as	we	have	seen	,	arriving	on	this	side	of	the	channel	,	is	through	a	parachute	.
so	just	as	a	curiosity	,	where	did	you	land	when	you	flew	over	the	grand	canyon	?
did	you	land	on	the	rim	,	down	at	the	bottom	?
yr	:	it	was	down	on	the	bottom	.
and	i	came	back	afterward	on	the	sled	of	the	helicopter	back	.
but	it	was	too	stoney	and	full	of	cactus	on	top	.
bg	:	that	's	exactly	why	i	asked	the	question	.
yr	:	and	also	the	currents	are	quite	funny	there	.
there	is	big	thermal	activity	,	big	difference	in	altitude	also	.
so	it	was	much	safer	for	me	to	land	at	the	bottom	.
bg	:	so	i	think	that	right	now	,	many	people	in	the	audience	are	asking	,	``	okay	,	when	are	you	developing	a	double	-	seater	so	they	can	fly	with	you	?	``
yr	:	i	have	a	standard	answer	.
have	you	ever	seen	tandem	birds	?
bg	:	perfect	answer	.
yves	,	one	last	question	.
what	's	next	for	you	?	what	's	next	for	jetman	?
yr	:	first	,	to	instruct	a	younger	guy	.
i	want	to	share	it	,	to	do	formation	flights	.
and	i	plan	to	start	from	a	cliff	,	like	catapulted	from	a	cliff	.
bg	:	so	instead	of	jumping	off	a	plane	,	yes	?
yr	:	yes	,	with	the	final	goal	to	take	off	,	but	with	initial	speed	.
really	,	i	go	step	by	step	.
it	seems	a	little	bit	crazy	,	but	it	's	not	.
it	's	possible	to	start	already	now	,	it	's	just	too	dangerous	.
thanks	to	the	increasing	technology	,	better	technology	,	it	will	be	safe	.
and	i	hope	it	will	be	for	everybody	.
bg	:	yves	,	thank	you	very	much	.	yves	rossy	.
