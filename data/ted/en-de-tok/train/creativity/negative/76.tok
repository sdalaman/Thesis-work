i	work	with	a	species	called	``	bonobo	.	``
and	i	'm	happy	most	of	the	time	,	because	i	think	this	is	the	happiest	species	on	the	planet	.
it	's	kind	of	a	well	-	kept	secret	.
this	species	lives	only	in	the	congo	.
and	they	're	not	in	too	many	zoos	,	because	of	their	sexual	behavior	.
their	sexual	behavior	is	too	human	-	like	for	most	of	us	to	be	comfortable	with	.
but	--	actually	,	we	have	a	lot	to	learn	from	them	,	because	they	're	a	very	egalitarian	society	and	they	're	a	very	empathetic	society	.
and	sexual	behavior	is	not	confined	to	one	aspect	of	their	life	that	they	sort	of	set	aside	.
it	permeates	their	entire	life	.
and	it	's	used	for	communication	.
and	it	's	used	for	conflict	resolution	.
and	i	think	perhaps	somewhere	in	our	history	we	sort	of	,	divided	our	lives	up	into	lots	of	parts	.
we	divided	our	world	up	with	lots	of	categories	.
and	so	everything	sort	of	has	a	place	that	it	has	to	fit	.
but	i	do	n't	think	that	we	were	that	way	initially	.
there	are	many	people	who	think	that	the	animal	world	is	hard	-	wired	and	that	there	's	something	very	,	very	special	about	man	.
maybe	it	's	his	ability	to	have	causal	thought	.
maybe	it	's	something	special	in	his	brain	that	allows	him	to	have	language	.
maybe	it	's	something	special	in	his	brain	that	allows	him	to	make	tools	or	to	have	mathematics	.
well	,	i	do	n't	know	.	there	were	tasmanians	who	were	discovered	around	the	1600s	and	they	had	no	fire	.
they	had	no	stone	tools	.
to	our	knowledge	they	had	no	music	.
so	when	you	compare	them	to	the	bonobo	,	the	bonobo	is	a	little	hairier	.
he	does	n't	stand	quite	as	upright	.
but	there	are	a	lot	of	similarities	.
and	i	think	that	as	we	look	at	culture	,	we	kind	of	come	to	understand	how	we	got	to	where	we	are	.
and	i	do	n't	really	think	it	's	in	our	biology	;	i	think	we	've	attributed	it	to	our	biology	,	but	i	do	n't	really	think	it	's	there	.
so	what	i	want	to	do	now	is	introduce	you	to	a	species	called	the	bonobo	.
this	is	kanzi	.
he	's	a	bonobo	.
right	now	,	he	's	in	a	forest	in	georgia	.
his	mother	originally	came	from	a	forest	in	africa	.
and	she	came	to	us	when	she	was	just	at	puberty	,	about	six	or	seven	years	of	age	.
now	this	shows	a	bonobo	on	your	right	,	and	a	chimpanzee	on	your	left	.
clearly	,	the	chimpanzee	has	a	little	bit	harder	time	of	walking	.
the	bonobo	,	although	shorter	than	us	and	their	arms	still	longer	,	is	more	upright	,	just	as	we	are	.
this	shows	the	bonobo	compared	to	an	australopithecine	like	lucy	.
as	you	can	see	,	there	's	not	a	lot	of	difference	between	the	way	a	bonobo	walks	and	the	way	an	early	australopithecine	would	have	walked	.
as	they	turn	toward	us	you	'll	see	that	the	pelvic	area	of	early	australopithecines	is	a	little	flatter	and	does	n't	have	to	rotate	quite	so	much	from	side	to	side	.
so	the	--	the	bipedal	gait	is	a	little	easier	.
and	now	we	see	all	four	.
video	:	narrator	:	the	wild	bonobo	lives	in	central	africa	,	in	the	jungle	encircled	by	the	congo	river	.
canopied	trees	as	tall	as	40	meters	,	130	feet	,	grow	densely	in	the	area	.
it	was	a	japanese	scientist	who	first	undertook	serious	field	studies	of	the	bonobo	,	almost	three	decades	ago	.
bonobos	are	built	slightly	smaller	than	the	chimpanzee	.
slim	-	bodied	,	bonobos	are	by	nature	very	gentle	creatures	.
long	and	careful	studies	have	reported	many	new	findings	on	them	.
one	discovery	was	that	wild	bonobos	often	walk	bidpedally	.
what	's	more	,	they	are	able	to	walk	upright	for	long	distances	.
susan	savage	-	rumbaugh	:	let	's	go	say	hello	to	austin	first	and	then	go	to	the	a	frame	.
ss	:	this	is	kanzi	and	i	,	in	the	forest	.
none	of	the	things	you	will	see	in	this	particular	video	are	trained	.
none	of	them	are	tricks	.
they	all	happened	to	be	captured	on	film	spontaneously	,	by	nhk	of	japan	.
we	have	eight	bonobos	.
video	:	look	at	all	this	stuff	that	's	here	for	our	campfire	.
ss	:	an	entire	family	at	our	research	centre	.
video	:	you	going	to	help	get	some	sticks	?
good	.
we	need	more	sticks	,	too	.
i	have	a	lighter	in	my	pocket	if	you	need	one	.
that	's	a	wasps	'	nest	.
you	can	get	it	out	.
i	hope	i	have	a	lighter	.
you	can	use	the	lighter	to	start	the	fire	.
ss	:	so	kanzi	is	very	interested	in	fire	.
he	does	n't	do	it	yet	without	a	lighter	,	but	i	think	if	he	saw	someone	do	it	,	he	might	be	able	to	do	--	make	a	fire	without	a	lighter	.
he	's	learning	about	how	to	keep	a	fire	going	.
he	's	learning	the	uses	for	a	fire	,	just	by	watching	what	we	do	with	fire	.
this	is	a	smile	on	the	face	of	a	bonobo	.
these	are	happy	vocalizations	.
video	:	you	're	happy	.
you	're	very	happy	about	this	part	.
you	've	got	to	put	some	water	on	the	fire	.	you	see	the	water	?
good	job	.
ss	:	forgot	to	zip	up	the	back	half	of	his	backpack	.
but	he	likes	to	carry	things	from	place	to	place	.
video	:	austin	,	i	hear	you	saying	``	austin	.	``
ss	:	he	talks	to	other	bonobos	at	the	lab	,	long	-	distance	,	farther	than	we	can	hear	.
this	is	his	sister	.
this	is	her	first	time	to	try	to	drive	a	golf	cart	.
video	:	goodbye	.
ss	:	she	's	got	the	pedals	down	,	but	not	the	wheel	.
she	switches	from	reverse	to	forward	and	she	holds	onto	the	wheel	,	rather	than	turns	it	.
like	us	,	she	knows	that	that	individual	in	the	mirror	is	her	.
video	:	narrator	:	by	raising	bonobos	in	a	culture	that	is	both	bonobo	and	human	,	and	documenting	their	development	across	two	decades	,	scientists	are	exploring	how	cultural	forces	may	have	operated	during	human	evolution	.
his	name	is	nyota	.
it	means	``	star	``	in	swahili	.
panbanisha	is	trying	to	give	nyota	a	haircut	with	a	pair	of	scissors	.
in	the	wild	,	the	parent	bonobo	is	known	to	groom	its	offspring	.
here	panbanisha	uses	scissors	,	instead	of	her	hands	,	to	groom	nyota	.
very	impressive	.
subtle	maneuvering	of	the	hands	is	required	to	perform	delicate	tasks	like	this	.
nyota	tries	to	imitate	panbanisha	by	using	the	scissors	himself	.
realizing	that	nyota	might	get	hurt	,	panbanisha	,	like	any	human	mother	,	carefully	tugs	to	get	the	scissors	back	.
he	can	now	cut	through	tough	animal	hide	.
ss	:	kanzi	's	learned	to	make	stone	tools	.
video	:	kanzi	now	makes	his	tools	,	just	as	our	ancestors	may	have	made	them	,	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	million	years	ago	--	by	holding	the	rocks	in	both	hands	,	to	strike	one	against	the	other	.
he	has	learned	that	by	using	both	hands	and	aiming	his	glancing	blows	,	he	can	make	much	larger	,	sharper	flakes	.
kanzi	chooses	a	flake	he	thinks	is	sharp	enough	.
the	tough	hide	is	difficult	to	cut	,	even	with	a	knife	.
the	rock	that	kanzi	is	using	is	extremely	hard	and	ideal	for	stone	tool	making	,	but	difficult	to	handle	,	requiring	great	skill	.
kanzi	's	rock	is	from	gona	,	ethiopia	and	is	identical	to	that	used	by	our	african	ancestors	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	million	years	ago	.
these	are	the	rocks	kanzi	used	and	these	are	the	flakes	he	made	.
the	flat	sharp	edges	are	like	knife	blades	.
compare	them	to	the	tools	our	ancestors	used	;	they	bear	a	striking	resemblance	to	kanzi	's	.
panbanisha	is	longing	to	go	for	a	walk	in	the	woods	.
she	keeps	staring	out	the	window	.
ss	:	this	is	--	let	me	show	you	something	we	did	n't	think	they	would	do	.
video	:	for	several	days	now	,	panbanisha	has	not	been	outside	.
ss	:	i	normally	talk	about	language	.
video	:	then	panbanisha	does	something	unexpected	.
ss	:	but	since	i	'm	advised	not	to	do	what	i	normally	do	,	i	have	n't	told	you	that	these	apes	have	language	.
it	's	a	geometric	language	.
video	:	she	takes	a	piece	of	chalk	and	begins	writing	something	on	the	floor	.
what	is	she	writing	?
ss	:	she	's	also	saying	the	name	of	that	,	with	her	voice	.
video	:	now	she	comes	up	to	dr.	sue	and	starts	writing	again	.
ss	:	these	are	her	symbols	on	her	keyboard	.
they	speak	when	she	touches	them	.
video	:	panbanisha	is	communicating	to	dr.	sue	where	she	wants	to	go	.
``	a	frame	``	represents	a	hut	in	the	woods	.
compare	the	chalk	writing	with	the	lexigram	on	the	keyboard	.
panbanisha	began	writing	the	lexigrams	on	the	forest	floor	.
ss	:	very	nice	.	beautiful	,	panbanisha	.
ss	:	at	first	we	did	n't	really	realize	what	she	was	doing	,	until	we	stood	back	and	looked	at	it	and	rotated	it	.
video	:	this	lexigram	also	refers	to	a	place	in	the	woods	.
the	curved	line	is	very	similar	to	the	lexigram	.
the	next	symbol	panbanisha	writes	represents	``	collar	.	``
it	indicates	the	collar	that	panbanisha	must	wear	when	she	goes	out	.
ss	:	that	's	an	institutional	requirement	.
video	:	this	symbol	is	not	as	clear	as	the	others	,	but	one	can	see	panbanisha	is	trying	to	produce	a	curved	line	and	several	straight	lines	.
researchers	began	to	record	what	panbanisha	said	,	by	writing	lexigrams	on	the	floor	with	chalk	.
panbanisha	watched	.
soon	she	began	to	write	as	well	.
the	bonobo	's	abilities	have	stunned	scientists	around	the	world	.
how	did	they	develop	?
ss	:	we	found	that	the	most	important	thing	for	permitting	bonobos	to	acquire	language	is	not	to	teach	them	.
it	's	simply	to	use	language	around	them	,	because	the	driving	force	in	language	acquisition	is	to	understand	what	others	,	that	are	important	to	you	,	are	saying	to	you	.
once	you	have	that	capacity	,	the	ability	to	produce	language	comes	rather	naturally	and	rather	freely	.
so	we	want	to	create	an	environment	in	which	bonobos	,	like	all	of	the	individuals	with	whom	they	are	interacting	--	we	want	to	create	an	environment	in	which	they	have	fun	,	and	an	environment	in	which	the	others	are	meaningful	individuals	for	them	.
narrator	:	this	environment	brings	out	unexpected	potential	in	kanzi	and	panbanisha	.
panbanisha	is	enjoying	playing	her	harmonica	,	until	nyota	,	now	one	year	old	,	steals	it	.
then	he	peers	eagerly	into	his	mother	's	mouth	.
is	he	looking	for	where	the	sound	came	from	?
dr.	sue	thinks	it	's	important	to	allow	such	curiosity	to	flourish	.
this	time	panbanisha	is	playing	the	electric	piano	.
she	was	n't	forced	to	learn	the	piano	;	she	saw	a	researcher	play	the	instrument	and	took	an	interest	.
researcher	:	go	ahead	.	go	ahead	.	i	'm	listening	.
do	that	real	fast	part	that	you	did	.	yeah	,	that	part	.
narrator	:	kanzi	plays	the	xylophone	;	using	both	hands	he	enthusiastically	accompanies	dr.	sue	's	singing	.
kanzi	and	panbanisha	are	stimulated	by	this	fun	-	filled	environment	,	which	promotes	the	emergence	of	these	cultural	capabilities	.
researcher	:	ok	,	now	get	the	monsters	.	get	them	.
take	the	cherries	too	.
now	watch	out	,	stay	away	from	them	now	.
now	you	can	chase	them	again	.	time	to	chase	them	.
now	you	have	to	stay	away	.	get	away	.
run	away	.	run	.
now	we	can	chase	them	again	.	go	get	them	.
oh	no	!
good	kanzi	.	very	good	.	thank	you	so	much	.
narrator	:	none	of	us	,	bonobo	or	human	,	can	possibly	even	imagine	?
ss	:	so	we	have	a	bi	-	species	environment	,	we	call	it	a	``	panhomoculture	.	``
we	're	learning	how	to	become	like	them	.
we	're	learning	how	to	communicate	with	them	,	in	really	high	-	pitched	tones	.
we	're	learning	that	they	probably	have	a	language	in	the	wild	.
and	they	're	learning	to	become	like	us	.
because	we	believe	that	it	's	not	biology	;	it	's	culture	.
so	we	're	sharing	tools	and	technology	and	language	with	another	species	.
thank	you	.
