i	'm	going	to	talk	about	your	mindset	.
does	your	mindset	correspond	to	my	dataset	?
if	not	,	one	or	the	other	needs	upgrading	,	is	n't	it	?
when	i	talk	to	my	students	about	global	issues	,	and	i	listen	to	them	in	the	coffee	break	,	they	always	talk	about	``	we	``	and	``	them	.	``
and	when	they	come	back	into	the	lecture	room	i	ask	them	,	``	what	do	you	mean	with	``	we	``	and	``	them	``	?
``	oh	,	it	's	very	easy	.	it	's	the	western	world	and	it	's	the	developing	world	,	``	they	say	.
``	we	learned	it	in	college	.	``
and	what	is	the	definition	then	?	``	the	definition	?
everyone	knows	,	``	they	say	.
but	then	you	know	,	i	press	them	like	this	.
so	one	girl	said	,	very	cleverly	,	``	it	's	very	easy	.
western	world	is	a	long	life	in	a	small	family	.
developing	world	is	a	short	life	in	a	large	family	.	``
and	i	like	that	definition	,	because	it	enabled	me	to	transfer	their	mindset	into	the	dataset	.
and	here	you	have	the	dataset	.
so	,	you	can	see	that	what	we	have	on	this	axis	here	is	size	of	family	.	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	children	per	woman	on	this	axis	.
and	here	,	length	of	life	,	life	expectancy	,	30	,	40	,	50	.
exactly	what	the	students	said	was	their	concept	about	the	world	.
and	really	this	is	about	the	bedroom	.
whether	the	man	and	woman	decide	to	have	small	family	,	and	take	care	of	their	kids	,	and	how	long	they	will	live	.
it	's	about	the	bathroom	and	the	kitchen	.	if	you	have	soap	,	water	and	food	,	you	know	,	you	can	live	long	.
and	the	students	were	right	.	it	was	n't	that	the	world	consisted	--	the	world	consisted	here	,	of	one	set	of	countries	over	here	,	which	had	large	families	and	short	life	.	developing	world	.
and	we	had	one	set	of	countries	up	there	which	was	the	western	world	.
they	had	small	families	and	long	life	.
and	you	are	going	to	see	here	the	amazing	thing	that	has	happened	in	the	world	during	my	lifetime	.
then	the	developing	countries	applied	soap	and	water	,	vaccination	.
and	all	the	developing	world	started	to	apply	family	planning	.
and	partly	to	usa	who	help	to	provide	technical	advice	and	investment	.
and	you	see	all	the	world	moves	over	to	a	two	child	family	,	and	a	life	with	60	to	70	years	.
but	some	countries	remain	back	in	this	area	here	.
and	you	can	see	we	still	have	afghanistan	down	here	.
we	have	liberia	.	we	have	congo	.
so	we	have	countries	living	there	.
so	the	problem	i	had	is	that	the	worldview	that	my	students	had	corresponds	to	reality	in	the	world	the	year	their	teachers	were	born	.
and	we	,	in	fact	,	when	we	have	played	this	over	the	world	.
i	was	at	the	global	health	conference	here	in	washington	last	week	,	and	i	could	see	the	wrong	concept	even	active	people	in	united	states	had	,	that	they	did	n't	realize	the	improvement	of	mexico	there	,	and	china	,	in	relation	to	united	states	.
look	here	when	i	move	them	forward	.
here	we	go	.
they	catch	up	.	there	's	mexico	.
it	's	on	par	with	united	states	in	these	two	social	dimensions	.
there	was	less	than	five	percent	of	the	specialists	in	global	health	that	was	aware	of	this	.
this	great	nation	,	mexico	,	has	the	problem	that	arms	are	coming	from	north	,	across	the	borders	,	so	they	had	to	stop	that	,	because	they	have	this	strange	relationship	to	the	united	states	,	you	know	.
but	if	i	would	change	this	axis	here	,	i	would	instead	put	income	per	person	.
income	per	person	.	i	can	put	that	here	.
and	we	will	then	see	a	completely	different	picture	.
by	the	way	,	i	'm	teaching	you	how	to	use	our	website	,	gapminder	world	,	while	i	'm	correcting	this	,	because	this	is	a	free	utility	on	the	net	.
and	when	i	now	finally	got	it	right	,	i	can	go	back	200	years	in	history	.
and	i	can	find	united	states	up	there	.
and	i	can	let	the	other	countries	be	shown	.
and	now	i	have	income	per	person	on	this	axis	.
and	united	states	only	had	some	,	one	,	two	thousand	dollars	at	that	time	.
and	the	life	expectancy	was	35	to	40	years	,	on	par	with	afghanistan	today	.
and	what	has	happened	in	the	world	,	i	will	show	now	.
this	is	instead	of	studying	history	for	one	year	at	university	.
you	can	watch	me	for	one	minute	now	and	you	'll	see	the	whole	thing	.
you	can	see	how	the	brown	bubbles	,	which	is	west	europe	,	and	the	yellow	one	,	which	is	the	united	states	,	they	get	richer	and	richer	and	also	start	to	get	healthier	and	healthier	.
and	this	is	now	100	years	ago	,	where	the	rest	of	the	world	remains	behind	.
here	we	come	.	and	that	was	the	influenza	.
that	's	why	we	are	so	scared	about	flu	,	is	n't	it	?
it	's	still	remembered	.	the	fall	of	life	expectancy	.
and	then	we	come	up	.	not	until	independence	started	.
look	here	you	have	china	over	there	,	you	have	india	over	there	,	and	this	is	what	has	happened	.
did	you	note	there	,	that	we	have	mexico	up	there	?
mexico	is	not	at	all	on	par	with	the	united	states	,	but	they	are	quite	close	.
and	especially	,	it	's	interesting	to	see	china	and	the	united	states	during	200	years	,	because	i	have	my	oldest	son	now	working	for	google	,	after	google	acquired	this	software	.
because	in	fact	,	this	is	child	labor	.	my	son	and	his	wife	sat	in	a	closet	for	many	years	and	developed	this	.
and	my	youngest	son	,	who	studied	chinese	in	beijing	.
so	they	come	in	with	the	two	perspectives	i	have	,	you	know	?
and	my	son	,	youngest	son	who	studied	in	beijing	,	in	china	,	he	got	a	long	-	term	perspective	.
whereas	when	my	oldest	son	,	who	works	for	google	,	he	should	develop	by	quarter	,	or	by	half	-	year	.
or	google	is	quite	generous	,	so	he	can	have	one	or	two	years	to	go	.
but	in	china	they	look	generation	after	generation	because	they	remember	the	very	embarrassing	period	,	for	100	years	,	when	they	went	backwards	.
and	then	they	would	remember	the	first	part	of	last	century	,	which	was	really	bad	,	and	we	could	go	by	this	so	-	called	great	leap	forward	.
but	this	was	1963	.
mao	tse	-	tung	eventually	brought	health	to	china	,	and	then	he	died	,	and	then	deng	xiaoping	started	this	amazing	move	forward	.
is	n't	it	strange	to	see	that	the	united	states	first	grew	the	economy	,	and	then	gradually	got	rich	?
whereas	china	could	get	healthy	much	earlier	,	because	they	applied	the	knowledge	of	education	,	nutrition	,	and	then	also	benefits	of	penicillin	and	vaccines	and	family	planning	.
and	asia	could	have	social	development	before	they	got	the	economic	development	.
so	to	me	,	as	a	public	health	professor	,	it	's	not	strange	that	all	these	countries	grow	so	fast	now	.
because	what	you	see	here	,	what	you	see	here	is	the	flat	world	of	thomas	friedman	,	is	n't	it	.
it	's	not	really	,	really	flat	.
but	the	middle	income	countries	--	and	this	is	where	i	suggest	to	my	students	,	stop	using	the	concept	``	developing	world	.	``
because	after	all	,	talking	about	the	developing	world	is	like	having	two	chapters	in	the	history	of	the	united	states	.
the	last	chapter	is	about	present	,	and	president	obama	,	and	the	other	is	about	the	past	,	where	you	cover	everything	from	washington	to	eisenhower	.
because	washington	to	eisenhower	,	that	is	what	we	find	in	the	developing	world	.
we	could	actually	go	to	mayflower	to	eisenhower	,	and	that	would	be	put	together	into	a	developing	world	,	which	is	rightly	growing	its	cities	in	a	very	amazing	way	,	which	have	great	entrepreneurs	,	but	also	have	the	collapsing	countries	.
so	,	how	could	we	make	better	sense	about	this	?
well	,	one	way	of	trying	is	to	see	whether	we	could	look	at	income	distribution	.
this	is	the	income	distribution	of	peoples	in	the	world	,	from	$	1	.	this	is	where	you	have	food	to	eat	.
these	people	go	to	bed	hungry	.
and	this	is	the	number	of	people	.
this	is	$	10	,	whether	you	have	a	public	or	a	private	health	service	system	.	this	is	where	you	can	provide	health	service	for	your	family	and	school	for	your	children	,	and	this	is	oecd	countries	:	green	,	latin	america	,	east	europe	.
this	is	east	asia	,	and	the	light	blue	there	is	south	asia	.
and	this	is	how	the	world	changed	.
it	changed	like	this	.
can	you	see	how	it	's	growing	?	and	how	hundreds	of	millions	and	billions	is	coming	out	of	poverty	in	asia	?
and	it	goes	over	here	?
and	i	come	now	,	into	projections	,	but	i	have	to	stop	at	the	door	of	lehman	brothers	there	,	you	know	,	because	--	that	's	where	the	projections	are	not	valid	any	longer	.
probably	the	world	will	do	this	.
and	then	it	will	continue	forward	like	this	.
but	more	or	less	,	this	is	what	will	happen	,	and	we	have	a	world	which	can	not	be	looked	upon	as	divided	.
we	have	the	high	income	countries	here	,	with	the	united	states	as	a	leading	power	;	we	have	the	emerging	economies	in	the	middle	,	which	provide	a	lot	of	the	funding	for	the	bailout	;	and	we	have	the	low	income	countries	here	.
yeah	,	this	is	a	fact	that	from	where	the	money	comes	,	they	have	been	saving	,	you	know	,	over	the	last	decade	.
and	here	we	have	the	low	income	countries	where	entrepreneurs	are	.
and	here	we	have	the	countries	in	collapse	and	war	,	like	afghanistan	,	somalia	,	parts	of	congo	,	darfur	.
we	have	all	this	at	the	same	time	.
that	's	why	it	's	so	problematic	to	describe	what	has	happened	in	the	developing	world	.
because	it	's	so	different	,	what	has	happened	there	.
and	that	's	why	i	suggest	a	slightly	different	approach	of	what	you	would	call	it	.
and	you	have	huge	differences	within	countries	also	.
i	heard	that	your	departments	here	were	by	regions	.
here	you	have	sub	-	saharan	africa	,	south	asia	,	east	asia	,	arab	states	,	east	europe	,	latin	america	,	and	oecd	.
and	on	this	axis	,	gdp	.
and	on	this	,	heath	,	child	survival	,	and	it	does	n't	come	as	a	surprise	that	africa	south	of	sahara	is	at	the	bottom	.
but	when	i	split	it	,	when	i	split	it	into	country	bubbles	,	the	size	of	the	bubbles	here	is	the	population	.
then	you	see	sierra	leone	and	mauritius	,	completely	different	.
there	is	such	a	difference	within	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
and	i	can	split	the	others	.	here	is	the	south	asian	,	arab	world	.
now	all	your	different	departments	.
east	europe	,	latin	america	,	and	oecd	countries	.
and	here	were	are	.	we	have	a	continuum	in	the	world	.
we	can	not	put	it	into	two	parts	.
it	is	mayflower	down	here	.	it	is	washington	here	,	building	,	building	countries	.
it	's	lincoln	here	,	advancing	them	.
it	's	eisenhower	bringing	modernity	into	the	countries	.
and	then	it	's	united	states	today	,	up	here	.
and	we	have	countries	all	this	way	.
now	,	this	is	the	important	thing	of	understanding	how	the	world	has	changed	.
at	this	point	i	decided	to	make	a	pause	.
and	it	is	my	task	,	on	behalf	of	the	rest	of	the	world	,	to	convey	a	thanks	to	the	u.s.	taxpayers	,	for	demographic	health	survey	.
many	are	not	aware	of	--	no	,	this	is	not	a	joke	.
this	is	very	serious	.
it	is	due	to	usa	's	continuous	sponsoring	during	25	years	of	the	very	good	methodology	for	measuring	child	mortality	that	we	have	a	grasp	of	what	's	happening	in	the	world	.
and	it	is	u.s.	government	at	its	best	,	without	advocacy	,	providing	facts	,	that	it	's	useful	for	the	society	.
and	providing	data	free	of	charge	on	the	internet	,	for	the	world	to	use	.	thank	you	very	much	.
quite	the	opposite	of	the	world	bank	,	who	compiled	data	with	government	money	,	tax	money	,	and	then	they	sell	it	to	add	a	little	profit	,	in	a	very	inefficient	,	gutenberg	way	.
but	the	people	doing	that	at	the	world	bank	are	among	the	best	in	the	world	.
and	they	are	highly	skilled	professionals	.
it	's	just	that	we	would	like	to	upgrade	our	international	agencies	to	deal	with	the	world	in	the	modern	way	,	as	we	do	.
and	when	it	comes	to	free	data	and	transparency	,	united	states	of	america	is	one	of	the	best	.
and	that	does	n't	come	easy	from	the	mouth	of	a	swedish	public	health	professor	.
and	i	'm	not	paid	to	come	here	,	no	.
i	would	like	to	show	you	what	happens	with	the	data	,	what	we	can	show	with	this	data	.
look	here	.	this	is	the	world	.
with	income	down	there	and	child	mortality	.
and	what	has	happened	in	the	world	?
since	1950	,	during	the	last	50	years	we	have	had	a	fall	in	child	mortality	.
and	it	is	the	dhs	that	makes	it	possible	to	know	this	.
and	we	had	an	increase	in	income	.
and	the	blue	former	developing	countries	are	mixing	up	with	the	former	industrialized	western	world	.
we	have	a	continuum	.	but	we	still	have	,	of	course	,	congo	,	up	there	.	we	still	have	as	poor	countries	as	we	have	had	,	always	,	in	history	.
and	that	's	the	bottom	billion	,	where	we	've	heard	today	about	a	completely	new	approach	to	do	it	.
and	how	fast	has	this	happened	?
well	,	mdg	4	.
the	united	states	has	not	been	so	eager	to	use	mdg	4	.
but	you	have	been	the	main	sponsor	that	has	enabled	us	to	measure	it	,	because	it	's	the	only	child	mortality	that	we	can	measure	.
and	we	used	to	say	that	it	should	fall	four	percent	per	year	.
let	's	see	what	sweden	has	done	.
we	used	to	boast	about	fast	social	progress	.
that	's	where	we	were	,	1900	.
1900	,	sweden	was	there	.
same	child	mortality	as	bangladesh	had	,	1990	,	though	they	had	lower	income	.
they	started	very	well	.	they	used	the	aid	well	.
they	vaccinated	the	kids	.	they	get	better	water	.
and	they	reduced	child	mortality	,	with	an	amazing	4.7	percent	per	year	.	they	beat	sweden	.
i	run	sweden	the	same	16	year	period	.
second	round	,	it	's	sweden	,	1916	,	against	egypt	,	1990	.
here	we	go	.	once	again	the	usa	is	part	of	the	reason	here	.
they	get	safe	water	,	they	get	food	for	the	poor	,	and	they	get	malaria	eradicated	.
5.5	percent	.	they	are	faster	than	the	millennium	development	goal	.
and	third	chance	for	sweden	,	against	brazil	here	.
brazil	here	has	amazing	social	improvement	over	the	last	16	years	,	and	they	go	faster	than	sweden	.
this	means	that	the	world	is	converging	.
the	middle	income	countries	,	the	emerging	economy	,	they	are	catching	up	.
they	are	moving	to	cities	,	where	they	also	get	better	assistance	for	that	.
well	the	swedish	students	protest	at	this	point	.
they	say	,	``	this	is	not	fair	,	because	these	countries	had	vaccines	and	antibiotics	that	were	not	available	for	sweden	.
we	have	to	do	real	-	time	competition	.	``
okay	.	i	give	you	singapore	,	the	year	i	was	born	.
singapore	had	twice	the	child	mortality	of	sweden	.
it	's	the	most	tropical	country	in	the	world	,	a	marshland	on	the	equator	.
and	here	we	go	.	it	took	a	little	time	for	them	to	get	independent	.
but	then	they	started	to	grow	their	economy	.
and	they	made	the	social	investment	.	they	got	away	malaria	.
they	got	a	magnificent	health	system	that	beat	both	the	u.s.	and	sweden	.
we	never	thought	it	would	happen	that	they	would	win	over	sweden	!
all	these	green	countries	are	achieving	millennium	development	goals	.
these	yellow	are	just	about	to	be	doing	this	.
these	red	are	the	countries	that	does	n't	do	it	,	and	the	policy	has	to	be	improved	.
not	simplistic	extrapolation	.
we	have	to	really	find	a	way	of	supporting	those	countries	in	a	better	way	.
we	have	to	respect	the	middle	income	countries	on	what	they	are	doing	.
and	we	have	to	fact	-	base	the	whole	way	we	look	at	the	world	.
this	is	dollar	per	person	.	this	is	hiv	in	the	countries	.
the	blue	is	africa	.
the	size	of	the	bubbles	is	how	many	are	hiv	affected	.
you	see	the	tragedy	in	south	africa	there	.
about	20	percent	of	the	adult	population	are	infected	.
and	in	spite	of	them	having	quite	a	high	income	,	they	have	a	huge	number	of	hiv	infected	.
but	you	also	see	that	there	are	african	countries	down	here	.
there	is	no	such	thing	as	an	hiv	epidemic	in	africa	.
there	's	a	number	,	five	to	10	countries	in	africa	that	has	the	same	level	as	sweden	and	united	states	.
and	there	are	others	who	are	extremely	high	.
and	i	will	show	you	that	what	has	happened	in	one	of	the	best	countries	,	with	the	most	vibrant	economy	in	africa	and	a	good	governance	,	botswana	.
they	have	a	very	high	level	.	it	's	coming	down	.
but	now	it	's	not	falling	,	because	there	,	with	help	from	pepfar	,	it	's	working	with	treatment	.	and	people	are	not	dying	.
and	you	can	see	it	's	not	that	easy	,	that	it	is	war	which	caused	this	.
because	here	,	in	congo	,	there	is	war	.
and	here	,	in	zambia	,	there	is	peace	.
and	it	's	not	the	economy	.	richer	country	has	a	little	higher	.
if	i	split	tanzania	in	its	income	,	the	richer	20	percent	in	tanzania	has	more	hiv	than	the	poorest	one	.
and	it	's	really	different	within	each	country	.
look	at	the	provinces	of	kenya	.	they	are	very	different	.
and	this	is	the	situation	you	see	.
it	's	not	deep	poverty	.	it	's	the	special	situation	,	probably	of	concurrent	sexual	partnership	among	part	of	the	heterosexual	population	in	some	countries	,	or	some	parts	of	countries	,	in	south	and	eastern	africa	.
do	n't	make	it	africa	.	do	n't	make	it	a	race	issue	.
make	it	a	local	issue	.	and	do	prevention	at	each	place	,	in	the	way	it	can	be	done	there	.
so	to	just	end	up	,	there	are	things	of	suffering	in	the	one	billion	poorest	,	which	we	do	n't	know	.
those	who	live	beyond	the	cellphone	,	those	who	have	yet	to	see	a	computer	,	those	who	have	no	electricity	at	home	.
this	is	the	disease	,	konzo	,	i	spent	20	years	elucidating	in	africa	.
it	's	caused	by	fast	processing	of	toxic	cassava	root	in	famine	situation	.
it	's	similar	to	the	pellagra	epidemic	in	mississippi	in	the	'30s	.
it	's	similar	to	other	nutritional	diseases	.
it	will	never	affect	a	rich	person	.
we	have	seen	it	here	in	mozambique	.
this	is	the	epidemic	in	mozambique	.	this	is	an	epidemic	in	northern	tanzania	.
you	never	heard	about	the	disease	.
but	it	's	much	more	than	ebola	that	has	been	affected	by	this	disease	.
cause	crippling	throughout	the	world	.
and	over	the	last	two	years	,	2,000	people	has	been	crippled	in	the	southern	tip	of	bandundu	region	.
that	used	to	be	the	illegal	diamond	trade	,	from	the	unita	-	dominated	area	in	angola	.
that	has	now	disappeared	,	and	they	are	now	in	great	economic	problem	.
and	one	week	ago	,	for	the	first	time	,	there	were	four	lines	on	the	internet	.
do	n't	get	confused	of	the	progress	of	the	emerging	economies	and	the	great	capacity	of	people	in	the	middle	income	countries	and	in	peaceful	low	income	countries	.
there	is	still	mystery	in	one	billion	.
and	we	have	to	have	more	concepts	than	just	developing	countries	and	developing	world	.
we	need	a	new	mindset	.	the	world	is	converging	,	but	--	but	--	but	not	the	bottom	billion	.
they	are	still	as	poor	as	they	've	ever	been	.
it	's	not	sustainable	,	and	it	will	not	happen	around	one	superpower	.
but	you	will	remain	one	of	the	most	important	superpowers	,	and	the	most	hopeful	superpower	,	for	the	time	to	be	.
and	this	institution	will	have	a	very	crucial	role	,	not	for	united	states	,	but	for	the	world	.
so	you	have	a	very	bad	name	,	state	department	.	this	is	not	the	state	department	.
it	's	the	world	department	.
and	we	have	a	high	hope	in	you	.	thank	you	very	much	.
