at	the	break	,	i	was	asked	by	several	people	about	my	comments	about	the	aging	debate	.
and	this	will	be	my	only	comment	on	it	.
and	that	is	,	i	understand	that	optimists	greatly	outlive	pessimists	.
what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	in	my	18	minutes	is	how	we	're	about	to	switch	from	reading	the	genetic	code	to	the	first	stages	of	beginning	to	write	the	code	ourselves	.
it	's	only	10	years	ago	this	month	when	we	published	the	first	sequence	of	a	free	-	living	organism	,	that	of	haemophilus	influenzae	.
that	took	a	genome	project	from	13	years	down	to	four	months	.
we	can	now	do	that	same	genome	project	in	the	order	of	two	to	eight	hours	.
so	in	the	last	decade	,	a	large	number	of	genomes	have	been	added	:	most	human	pathogens	,	a	couple	of	plants	,	several	insects	and	several	mammals	,	including	the	human	genome	.
genomics	at	this	stage	of	the	thinking	from	a	little	over	10	years	ago	was	,	by	the	end	of	this	year	,	we	might	have	between	three	and	five	genomes	sequenced	;	it	's	on	the	order	of	several	hundred	.
we	just	got	a	grant	from	the	gordon	and	betty	moore	foundation	to	sequence	130	genomes	this	year	,	as	a	side	project	from	environmental	organisms	.
so	the	rate	of	reading	the	genetic	code	has	changed	.
but	as	we	look	,	what	's	out	there	,	we	've	barely	scratched	the	surface	on	what	is	available	on	this	planet	.
most	people	do	n't	realize	it	,	because	they	're	invisible	,	but	microbes	make	up	about	a	half	of	the	earth	's	biomass	,	whereas	all	animals	only	make	up	about	one	one	-	thousandth	of	all	the	biomass	.
and	maybe	it	's	something	that	people	in	oxford	do	n't	do	very	often	,	but	if	you	ever	make	it	to	the	sea	,	and	you	swallow	a	mouthful	of	seawater	,	keep	in	mind	that	each	milliliter	has	about	a	million	bacteria	and	on	the	order	of	10	million	viruses	.
less	than	5,000	microbial	species	have	been	characterized	as	of	two	years	ago	,	and	so	we	decided	to	do	something	about	it	.
and	we	started	the	sorcerer	ii	expedition	,	where	we	were	,	as	with	great	oceanographic	expeditions	,	trying	to	sample	the	ocean	every	200	miles	.
we	started	in	bermuda	for	our	test	project	,	then	moved	up	to	halifax	,	working	down	the	u.s.	east	coast	,	the	caribbean	sea	,	the	panama	canal	,	through	to	the	galapagos	,	then	across	the	pacific	,	and	we	're	in	the	process	now	of	working	our	way	across	the	indian	ocean	.
it	's	very	tough	duty	;	we	're	doing	this	on	a	sailing	vessel	,	in	part	to	help	excite	young	people	about	going	into	science	.
the	experiments	are	incredibly	simple	.
we	just	take	seawater	and	we	filter	it	,	and	we	collect	different	size	organisms	on	different	filters	,	and	then	take	their	dna	back	to	our	lab	in	rockville	,	where	we	can	sequence	a	hundred	million	letters	of	the	genetic	code	every	24	hours	.
and	with	doing	this	,	we	've	made	some	amazing	discoveries	.
for	example	,	it	was	thought	that	the	visual	pigments	that	are	in	our	eyes	--	there	was	only	one	or	two	organisms	in	the	environment	that	had	these	same	pigments	.
it	turns	out	,	almost	every	species	in	the	upper	parts	of	the	ocean	in	warm	parts	of	the	world	have	these	same	photoreceptors	,	and	use	sunlight	as	the	source	of	their	energy	and	communication	.
from	one	site	,	from	one	barrel	of	seawater	,	we	discovered	1.3	million	new	genes	and	as	many	as	50,000	new	species	.
we	've	extended	this	to	the	air	now	with	a	grant	from	the	sloan	foundation	.
we	're	measuring	how	many	viruses	and	bacteria	all	of	us	are	breathing	in	and	out	every	day	,	particularly	on	airplanes	or	closed	auditoriums	.
we	filter	through	some	simple	apparatuses	;	we	collect	on	the	order	of	a	billion	microbes	from	just	a	day	filtering	on	top	of	a	building	in	new	york	city	.
and	we	're	in	the	process	of	sequencing	all	that	at	the	present	time	.
just	on	the	data	collection	side	,	just	where	we	are	through	the	galapagos	,	we	're	finding	that	almost	every	200	miles	,	we	see	tremendous	diversity	in	the	samples	in	the	ocean	.
some	of	these	make	logical	sense	,	in	terms	of	different	temperature	gradients	.
so	this	is	a	satellite	photograph	based	on	temperatures	--	red	being	warm	,	blue	being	cold	--	and	we	found	there	's	a	tremendous	difference	between	the	warm	water	samples	and	the	cold	water	samples	,	in	terms	of	abundant	species	.
the	other	thing	that	surprised	us	quite	a	bit	is	these	photoreceptors	detect	different	wavelengths	of	light	,	and	we	can	predict	that	based	on	their	amino	acid	sequence	.
and	these	vary	tremendously	from	region	to	region	.
maybe	not	surprisingly	,	in	the	deep	ocean	,	where	it	's	mostly	blue	,	the	photoreceptors	tend	to	see	blue	light	.
when	there	's	a	lot	of	chlorophyll	around	,	they	see	a	lot	of	green	light	.
but	they	vary	even	more	,	possibly	moving	towards	infrared	and	ultraviolet	in	the	extremes	.
just	to	try	and	get	an	assessment	of	what	our	gene	repertoire	was	,	we	assembled	all	the	data	--	including	all	of	ours	thus	far	from	the	expedition	,	which	represents	more	than	half	of	all	the	gene	data	on	the	planet	--	and	it	totaled	around	29	million	genes	.
and	we	tried	to	put	these	into	gene	families	to	see	what	these	discoveries	are	:	are	we	just	discovering	new	members	of	known	families	,	or	are	we	discovering	new	families	?
and	it	turns	out	we	have	about	50,000	major	gene	families	,	but	every	new	sample	we	take	in	the	environment	adds	in	a	linear	fashion	to	these	new	families	.
so	we	're	at	the	earliest	stages	of	discovery	about	basic	genes	,	components	and	life	on	this	planet	.
when	we	look	at	the	so	-	called	evolutionary	tree	,	we	're	up	on	the	upper	right	-	hand	corner	with	the	animals	.
of	those	roughly	29	million	genes	,	we	only	have	around	24,000	in	our	genome	.
and	if	you	take	all	animals	together	,	we	probably	share	less	than	30,000	and	probably	maybe	a	dozen	or	more	thousand	different	gene	families	.
i	view	that	these	genes	are	now	not	only	the	design	components	of	evolution	.
and	we	think	in	a	gene	-	centric	view	--	maybe	going	back	to	richard	dawkins	'	ideas	--	than	in	a	genome	-	centric	view	,	which	are	different	constructs	of	these	gene	components	.
synthetic	dna	,	the	ability	to	synthesize	dna	,	has	changed	at	sort	of	the	same	pace	that	dna	sequencing	has	over	the	last	decade	or	two	,	and	is	getting	very	rapid	and	very	cheap	.
our	first	thought	about	synthetic	genomics	came	when	we	sequenced	the	second	genome	back	in	1995	,	and	that	from	mycoplasma	genitalium	.
and	we	have	really	nice	t	-	shirts	that	say	,	you	know	,	``	i	heart	my	genitalium	.	``
this	is	actually	just	a	microorganism	.
but	it	has	roughly	500	genes	.
haemophilus	had	1,800	genes	.
and	we	simply	asked	the	question	,	if	one	species	needs	800	,	another	500	,	is	there	a	smaller	set	of	genes	that	might	comprise	a	minimal	operating	system	?
so	we	started	doing	transposon	mutagenesis	.
transposons	are	just	small	pieces	of	dna	that	randomly	insert	in	the	genetic	code	.
and	if	they	insert	in	the	middle	of	the	gene	,	they	disrupt	its	function	.
so	we	made	a	map	of	all	the	genes	that	could	take	transposon	insertions	and	we	called	those	``	non	-	essential	genes	.	``
but	it	turns	out	the	environment	is	very	critical	for	this	,	and	you	can	only	define	an	essential	or	non	-	essential	gene	based	on	exactly	what	's	in	the	environment	.
we	also	tried	to	take	a	more	directly	intellectual	approach	with	the	genomes	of	13	related	organisms	,	and	we	tried	to	compare	all	of	those	,	to	see	what	they	had	in	common	.
and	we	got	these	overlapping	circles	.	and	we	found	only	173	genes	common	to	all	13	organisms	.
the	pool	expanded	a	little	bit	if	we	ignored	one	intracellular	parasite	;	it	expanded	even	more	when	we	looked	at	core	sets	of	genes	of	around	310	or	so	.
so	we	think	that	we	can	expand	or	contract	genomes	,	depending	on	your	point	of	view	here	,	to	maybe	300	to	400	genes	from	the	minimal	of	500	.
the	only	way	to	prove	these	ideas	was	to	construct	an	artificial	chromosome	with	those	genes	in	them	,	and	we	had	to	do	this	in	a	cassette	-	based	fashion	.
we	found	that	synthesizing	accurate	dna	in	large	pieces	was	extremely	difficult	.
ham	smith	and	clyde	hutchison	,	my	colleagues	on	this	,	developed	an	exciting	new	method	that	allowed	us	to	synthesize	a	5,000	-	base	pair	virus	in	only	a	two	-	week	period	that	was	100	percent	accurate	,	in	terms	of	its	sequence	and	its	biology	.
it	was	a	quite	exciting	experiment	--	when	we	just	took	the	synthetic	piece	of	dna	,	injected	it	in	the	bacteria	and	all	of	a	sudden	,	that	dna	started	driving	the	production	of	the	virus	particles	that	turned	around	and	then	killed	the	bacteria	.
this	was	not	the	first	synthetic	virus	--	a	polio	virus	had	been	made	a	year	before	--	but	it	was	only	one	ten	-	thousandth	as	active	and	it	took	three	years	to	do	.
this	is	a	cartoon	of	the	structure	of	phi	x	174	.
this	is	a	case	where	the	software	now	builds	its	own	hardware	,	and	that	's	the	notions	that	we	have	with	biology	.
people	immediately	jump	to	concerns	about	biological	warfare	,	and	i	had	recent	testimony	before	a	senate	committee	,	and	a	special	committee	the	u.s.	government	has	set	up	to	review	this	area	.
and	i	think	it	's	important	to	keep	reality	in	mind	,	versus	what	happens	with	people	's	imaginations	.
basically	,	any	virus	that	's	been	sequenced	today	--	that	genome	can	be	made	.
and	people	immediately	freak	out	about	things	about	ebola	or	smallpox	,	but	the	dna	from	this	organism	is	not	infective	.
so	even	if	somebody	made	the	smallpox	genome	,	that	dna	itself	would	not	cause	infections	.
the	real	concern	that	security	departments	have	is	designer	viruses	.
and	there	's	only	two	countries	,	the	u.s.	and	the	former	soviet	union	,	that	had	major	efforts	on	trying	to	create	biological	warfare	agents	.
if	that	research	is	truly	discontinued	,	there	should	be	very	little	activity	on	the	know	-	how	to	make	designer	viruses	in	the	future	.
i	think	single	-	cell	organisms	are	possible	within	two	years	.
and	possibly	eukaryotic	cells	,	those	that	we	have	,	are	possible	within	a	decade	.
so	we	're	now	making	several	dozen	different	constructs	,	because	we	can	vary	the	cassettes	and	the	genes	that	go	into	this	artificial	chromosome	.
the	key	is	,	how	do	you	put	all	of	the	others	?
we	start	with	these	fragments	,	and	then	we	have	a	homologous	recombination	system	that	reassembles	those	into	a	chromosome	.
this	is	derived	from	an	organism	,	deinococcus	radiodurans	,	that	can	take	three	million	rads	of	radiation	and	not	be	killed	.
it	reassembles	its	genome	after	this	radiation	burst	in	about	12	to	24	hours	,	after	its	chromosomes	are	literally	blown	apart	.
this	organism	is	ubiquitous	on	the	planet	,	and	exists	perhaps	now	in	outer	space	due	to	all	our	travel	there	.
this	is	a	glass	beaker	after	about	half	a	million	rads	of	radiation	.
the	glass	started	to	burn	and	crack	,	while	the	microbes	sitting	in	the	bottom	just	got	happier	and	happier	.
here	's	an	actual	picture	of	what	happens	:	the	top	of	this	shows	the	genome	after	1.7	million	rads	of	radiation	.
the	chromosome	is	literally	blown	apart	.
and	here	's	that	same	dna	automatically	reassembled	24	hours	later	.
it	's	truly	stunning	that	these	organisms	can	do	that	,	and	we	probably	have	thousands	,	if	not	tens	of	thousands	,	of	different	species	on	this	planet	that	are	capable	of	doing	that	.
after	these	genomes	are	synthesized	,	the	first	step	is	just	transplanting	them	into	a	cell	without	a	genome	.
so	we	think	synthetic	cells	are	going	to	have	tremendous	potential	,	not	only	for	understanding	the	basis	of	biology	but	for	hopefully	environmental	and	society	issues	.
for	example	,	from	the	third	organism	we	sequenced	,	methanococcus	jannaschii	--	it	lives	in	boiling	water	temperatures	;	its	energy	source	is	hydrogen	and	all	its	carbon	comes	from	co	2	it	captures	back	from	the	environment	.
so	we	know	lots	of	different	pathways	,	thousands	of	different	organisms	now	that	live	off	of	co	2	,	and	can	capture	that	back	.
so	instead	of	using	carbon	from	oil	for	synthetic	processes	,	we	have	the	chance	of	using	carbon	and	capturing	it	back	from	the	atmosphere	,	converting	that	into	biopolymers	or	other	products	.
we	have	one	organism	that	lives	off	of	carbon	monoxide	,	and	we	use	as	a	reducing	power	to	split	water	to	produce	hydrogen	and	oxygen	.
also	,	there	's	numerous	pathways	that	can	be	engineered	metabolizing	methane	.
and	dupont	has	a	major	program	with	statoil	in	norway	to	capture	and	convert	the	methane	from	the	gas	fields	there	into	useful	products	.
within	a	short	while	,	i	think	there	's	going	to	be	a	new	field	called	``	combinatorial	genomics	,	``	because	with	these	new	synthesis	capabilities	,	these	vast	gene	array	repertoires	and	the	homologous	recombination	,	we	think	we	can	design	a	robot	to	make	maybe	a	million	different	chromosomes	a	day	.
and	therefore	,	as	with	all	biology	,	you	get	selection	through	screening	,	whether	you	're	screening	for	hydrogen	production	,	or	chemical	production	,	or	just	viability	.
to	understand	the	role	of	these	genes	is	going	to	be	well	within	reach	.
we	're	trying	to	modify	photosynthesis	to	produce	hydrogen	directly	from	sunlight	.
photosynthesis	is	modulated	by	oxygen	,	and	we	have	an	oxygen	-	insensitive	hydrogenase	that	we	think	will	totally	change	this	process	.
we	're	also	combining	cellulases	,	the	enzymes	that	break	down	complex	sugars	into	simple	sugars	and	fermentation	in	the	same	cell	for	producing	ethanol	.
pharmaceutical	production	is	already	under	way	in	major	laboratories	using	microbes	.
the	chemistry	from	compounds	in	the	environment	is	orders	of	magnitude	more	complex	than	our	best	chemists	can	produce	.
i	think	future	engineered	species	could	be	the	source	of	food	,	hopefully	a	source	of	energy	,	environmental	remediation	and	perhaps	replacing	the	petrochemical	industry	.
let	me	just	close	with	ethical	and	policy	studies	.
we	delayed	the	start	of	our	experiments	in	1999	until	we	completed	a	year	-	and	-	a	-	half	bioethical	review	as	to	whether	we	should	try	and	make	an	artificial	species	.
every	major	religion	participated	in	this	.
it	was	actually	a	very	strange	study	,	because	the	various	religious	leaders	were	using	their	scriptures	as	law	books	,	and	they	could	n't	find	anything	in	them	prohibiting	making	life	,	so	it	must	be	ok	.	the	only	ultimate	concerns	were	biological	warfare	aspects	of	this	,	but	gave	us	the	go	ahead	to	start	these	experiments	for	the	reasons	we	were	doing	them	.
right	now	the	sloan	foundation	has	just	funded	a	multi	-	institutional	study	on	this	,	to	work	out	what	the	risk	and	benefits	to	society	are	,	and	the	rules	that	scientific	teams	such	as	my	own	should	be	using	in	this	area	,	and	we	're	trying	to	set	good	examples	as	we	go	forward	.
these	are	complex	issues	.
except	for	the	threat	of	bio	-	terrorism	,	they	're	very	simple	issues	in	terms	of	,	can	we	design	things	to	produce	clean	energy	,	perhaps	revolutionizing	what	developing	countries	can	do	and	provide	through	various	simple	processes	.
thank	you	very	much	.
