i	'm	a	process	engineer	.
i	know	all	about	boilers	and	incinerators	and	fabric	filters	and	cyclones	and	things	like	that	,	but	i	also	have	marfan	syndrome	.
this	is	an	inherited	disorder	.
and	in	1992	i	participated	in	a	genetic	study	and	found	to	my	horror	,	as	you	can	see	from	the	slide	,	that	my	ascending	aorta	was	not	in	the	normal	range	,	the	green	line	at	the	bottom	.
everyone	in	here	will	be	between	3.2	and	3.6	cm	.
i	was	already	up	at	4.4	.
and	as	you	can	see	,	my	aorta	dilated	progressively	,	and	i	got	closer	and	closer	to	the	point	where	surgery	was	going	to	be	necessary	.
the	surgery	on	offer	was	pretty	gruesome	--	anesthetize	you	,	open	your	chest	,	put	you	on	an	artificial	heart	and	lung	machine	,	drop	your	body	temperature	to	about	18	centigrade	,	stop	your	heart	,	cut	the	aorta	out	,	replace	it	with	a	plastic	valve	and	a	plastic	aorta	,	and	,	most	importantly	,	commit	you	to	a	lifetime	of	anticoagulation	therapy	,	normally	warfarin	.
the	thought	of	the	surgery	was	not	attractive	.
the	thought	of	the	warfarin	was	really	quite	frightening	.
so	i	said	to	myself	,	i	'm	an	engineer	,	i	'm	in	r	and	d	,	this	is	just	a	plumbing	problem	.
i	can	do	this	.	i	can	change	this	.
so	i	set	out	to	change	the	entire	treatment	for	aortic	dilation	.
the	project	aim	is	really	quite	simple	.
the	only	real	problem	with	the	ascending	aorta	in	people	with	marfan	syndrome	is	it	lacks	some	tensile	strength	.
so	the	possibility	exists	to	simply	externally	wrap	the	pipe	.
and	it	would	remain	stable	and	operate	quite	happily	.
if	your	high	-	pressure	hose	pipe	,	or	your	high	-	pressure	hydraulic	line	,	bulges	a	little	,	you	just	wrap	some	tape	around	the	outside	of	it	.
it	really	is	that	simple	in	concept	,	though	not	in	execution	.
the	great	advantage	of	an	external	support	for	me	was	that	i	could	retain	all	of	my	own	bits	,	all	of	my	own	endothelium	and	valves	,	and	not	need	any	anticoagulation	therapy	.
so	where	do	we	start	?
well	this	is	a	sagittal	slice	through	me	.
you	could	see	in	the	middle	that	device	,	that	little	structure	,	squeezing	out	.
now	that	's	a	left	ventricle	pushing	blood	up	through	the	aortic	valve	--	you	can	see	two	of	the	leaflets	of	the	aortic	valve	working	there	--	up	into	the	ascending	aorta	.
and	it	's	that	part	,	the	ascending	aorta	,	which	dilates	and	ultimately	bursts	,	which	,	of	course	,	is	fatal	.
we	started	by	organizing	image	acquisition	from	magnetic	resonance	imaging	machines	and	ct	imaging	machines	from	which	to	make	a	model	of	the	patient	's	aorta	.
this	is	a	model	of	my	aorta	.
i	've	got	a	real	one	in	my	pocket	,	if	anyone	would	like	to	look	at	it	and	play	with	it	.
you	can	see	,	it	's	quite	a	complex	structure	.
it	has	a	funny	trilobal	shape	at	the	bottom	,	which	contains	the	aortic	valve	.
it	then	comes	back	into	a	round	form	and	then	tapers	and	curves	off	.
so	it	's	quite	a	difficult	structure	to	produce	.
this	,	like	i	say	,	is	a	cad	model	of	me	,	and	this	is	one	of	the	later	cad	models	.
we	went	through	an	iterative	process	of	producing	better	and	better	models	.
when	we	produced	that	model	we	turn	it	into	a	solid	plastic	model	,	as	you	can	see	,	using	a	rapid	prototyping	technique	,	another	engineering	technique	.
we	then	use	that	former	to	manufacture	a	perfectly	bespoke	porous	textile	mesh	,	which	takes	the	shape	of	the	former	and	perfectly	fits	the	aorta	.
so	this	is	absolutely	personalized	medicine	at	its	best	really	.
every	patient	we	do	has	an	absolutely	bespoke	implant	.
once	you	've	made	it	,	the	installation	's	quite	easy	.
john	pepper	,	bless	his	heart	,	professor	of	cardiothoracic	surgery	--	never	done	it	before	in	his	life	--	he	put	the	first	one	in	,	did	n't	like	it	,	took	it	out	,	put	the	second	one	in	.
happy	,	away	i	went	.
four	and	a	half	hours	on	the	table	and	everything	was	done	.
so	the	surgical	implantation	actually	was	the	easiest	part	.
if	you	compare	our	new	treatment	to	the	existing	alternative	,	the	so	-	called	composite	aortic	root	graft	,	there	are	one	of	two	startling	comparisons	,	which	i	'm	sure	will	be	clear	to	all	of	you	.
two	hours	to	install	one	of	our	devices	compared	to	six	hours	for	the	existing	treatment	.
the	existing	treatment	requires	,	as	i	've	said	,	the	heart	and	lung	bypass	machine	and	it	requires	a	total	body	cooling	.
we	do	n't	need	any	of	that	;	we	work	on	a	beating	heart	.
he	opens	you	up	,	he	accesses	the	aorta	while	your	heart	is	beating	,	all	at	the	right	temperature	.
no	breaking	into	your	circulatory	system	.
so	it	really	is	great	.
but	for	me	,	absolutely	the	best	point	is	there	is	no	anticoagulation	therapy	required	.
i	do	n't	take	any	drugs	at	all	other	than	recreational	ones	that	i	would	choose	to	take	.
and	in	fact	,	if	you	speak	to	people	who	are	on	long	-	term	warfarin	,	it	is	a	serious	compromise	to	your	quality	of	life	.
and	even	worse	,	it	inevitably	foreshortens	your	life	.
likewise	,	if	you	have	the	artificial	valve	option	,	you	're	committed	to	antibiotic	therapy	whenever	you	have	any	intrusive	medical	treatment	at	all	.
even	trips	to	the	dentist	require	that	you	take	antibiotics	,	in	case	you	get	an	internal	infection	on	the	valve	.
again	,	i	do	n't	have	any	of	that	,	so	i	'm	entirely	free	.
my	aorta	is	fixed	,	i	have	n't	got	to	worry	about	it	,	which	is	a	rebirth	for	me	.
back	to	the	theme	of	the	presentation	:	in	multidisciplinary	research	,	how	on	earth	does	a	process	engineer	used	to	working	with	boilers	end	up	producing	a	medical	device	which	transforms	his	own	life	?
well	the	answer	to	that	is	a	multidisciplinary	team	.
this	is	a	list	of	the	core	team	.
and	as	you	can	see	,	there	are	not	only	two	principal	technical	disciplines	there	,	medicine	and	engineering	,	but	also	there	are	various	specialists	from	within	those	two	disciplines	.
john	pepper	there	was	the	cardiac	surgeon	who	did	the	actual	work	on	me	,	but	everyone	else	there	had	to	contribute	one	way	or	another	.
raad	mohiaddin	,	medical	radiologist	:	we	had	to	get	good	quality	images	from	which	to	make	the	cad	model	.
warren	thornton	,	who	still	does	all	our	cad	models	for	us	,	had	to	write	a	bespoke	piece	of	cad	code	to	produce	this	model	from	this	really	rather	difficult	input	data	set	.
there	are	some	barriers	to	this	though	.	there	are	some	problems	with	it	.
jargon	is	a	big	one	.
i	would	think	no	one	in	this	room	understands	those	four	first	jargon	points	there	.
the	engineers	amongst	you	will	recognize	rapid	prototyping	and	cad	.
the	medics	amongst	you	,	if	there	are	any	,	will	recognize	the	first	two	.
but	there	will	be	nobody	else	in	this	room	that	understands	all	of	those	four	words	.
taking	the	jargon	out	was	very	important	to	ensure	that	everyone	in	the	team	understood	exactly	what	was	meant	when	a	particular	phrase	was	used	.
our	disciplinary	conventions	were	funny	as	well	.
we	took	a	lot	of	horizontal	slice	images	through	me	,	produced	those	slices	and	then	used	those	to	build	a	cad	model	.
and	the	very	first	cad	model	we	made	,	the	surgeons	were	playing	with	the	plastic	model	,	could	n't	quite	figure	it	out	.
and	then	we	realized	that	it	was	actually	a	mirror	image	of	the	real	aorta	.
and	it	was	a	mirror	image	because	in	the	real	world	we	always	look	down	on	plans	,	plans	of	houses	or	streets	or	maps	.
in	the	medical	world	they	look	up	at	plans	.
so	the	horizontal	images	were	all	an	inversion	.
so	one	needs	to	be	careful	with	disciplinary	conventions	.
everyone	needs	to	understand	what	is	assumed	and	what	is	not	assumed	.
institutional	barriers	were	another	serious	headache	in	the	project	.
the	brompton	hospital	was	taken	over	by	imperial	college	's	school	of	medicine	,	and	there	are	some	seriously	bad	relationship	problems	between	the	two	organizations	.
i	was	working	with	imperial	and	the	brompton	,	and	this	generated	some	serious	problems	with	the	project	,	really	problems	that	should	n't	exist	.
research	and	ethics	committee	:	if	you	want	to	do	anything	new	in	surgery	,	you	have	to	get	a	license	from	your	local	research	and	ethics	.
i	'm	sure	it	's	the	same	in	poland	.
there	will	be	some	form	of	equivalent	,	which	licenses	new	types	of	surgery	.
we	did	n't	only	have	the	bureaucratic	problems	associated	with	that	,	was	also	had	professional	jealousies	.
there	were	people	on	the	research	and	ethics	committee	who	really	did	n't	want	to	see	john	pepper	succeed	again	,	because	he	's	so	successful	.
and	they	made	extra	problems	for	us	.
bureaucratic	problems	:	ultimately	when	you	have	a	new	treatment	you	have	to	have	a	guidance	note	going	out	for	all	of	the	hospitals	in	the	country	.
in	the	u.k.	we	have	the	national	institute	for	clinical	excellence	,	nice	.
you	'll	have	an	equivalent	in	poland	,	no	doubt	.
we	had	to	get	past	the	nice	problem	.
we	now	have	a	great	clinical	guidance	out	on	the	net	.
so	any	of	the	hospitals	interested	can	come	along	,	read	the	nice	report	get	in	touch	with	us	and	then	get	doing	it	themselves	.
funding	barriers	:	another	big	area	to	be	concerned	with	.
a	big	problem	with	understanding	one	of	those	perspectives	:	when	we	first	approached	one	of	the	big	u.k.	charitable	organizations	that	funds	this	kind	of	stuff	,	what	they	were	looking	at	was	essentially	an	engineering	proposal	.
they	did	n't	understand	it	;	they	were	doctors	,	they	were	next	to	god	.
it	must	be	rubbish	.	they	binned	it	.
so	in	the	end	i	went	to	private	investors	and	i	just	gave	up	on	it	.
but	most	r	and	d	is	going	to	be	institutionally	funded	,	by	the	polish	academy	of	sciences	or	the	engineering	and	physical	sciences	research	council	or	whatever	,	and	you	need	to	get	past	those	people	.
jargon	is	a	huge	problem	when	you	're	trying	to	work	across	disciplines	,	because	in	an	engineering	world	,	we	all	understand	cad	and	r.p	.	--	not	in	the	medical	world	.
i	suppose	ultimately	the	funding	bureaucrats	have	really	got	to	get	their	act	together	.
they	've	really	got	to	start	talking	to	each	other	,	and	they	've	got	to	exercise	a	bit	of	imagination	,	if	that	's	not	too	much	to	ask	--	which	it	probably	is	.
i	've	coined	a	phrase	``	obstructive	conservatism	.	``
so	many	people	in	the	medical	world	do	n't	want	to	change	,	particularly	not	when	some	jumped	-	up	engineer	has	come	along	with	the	answer	.
they	do	n't	want	to	change	.
they	simply	want	to	do	whatever	they	've	done	before	.
and	in	fact	,	there	are	many	surgeons	in	the	u.k	.
still	waiting	for	one	of	our	patients	to	have	some	sort	of	episode	,	so	that	they	can	say	,	``	ah	,	i	told	you	that	was	no	good	.	``
we	've	actually	got	30	patients	.
i	'm	at	seven	and	a	half	years	.
we	've	got	90	post	-	op	patient	years	between	us	,	and	we	have	n't	had	a	single	problem	.
and	still	,	there	are	people	in	the	u.k.	saying	,	``	yeah	,	that	external	aortic	root	,	yeah	,	it	'll	never	work	,	you	know	.	``
it	really	is	a	problem	.	it	really	is	a	problem	.
i	'm	sure	everyone	in	this	room	has	come	across	arrogance	amongst	medics	,	doctors	,	surgeons	at	some	point	.
the	middle	point	is	simply	the	way	that	the	doctors	protect	themselves	.
``	yeah	,	well	of	course	,	i	'm	looking	after	my	patient	.	``
i	think	it	's	not	good	,	but	there	you	are	,	that	's	my	view	.
egos	,	of	course	,	again	,	a	huge	problem	if	you	're	working	in	a	multidisciplinary	team	,	you	've	got	to	give	your	guys	the	benefit	of	the	doubt	.
you	've	got	to	express	support	for	them	.
tom	treasure	,	professor	of	cardiothoracic	surgery	:	incredible	guy	.
dead	easy	to	give	him	respect	.
him	giving	me	respect	?	slightly	different	.
that	's	all	the	bad	news	.
the	good	news	is	the	benefits	are	stonkingly	huge	.
translate	that	one	.	i	bet	they	ca	n't	.
when	you	have	a	group	of	people	who	have	had	a	different	professional	training	,	a	different	professional	experience	,	they	not	only	have	a	different	knowledge	base	,	but	they	have	a	different	perspective	on	everything	.
and	if	you	can	bring	those	guys	together	and	you	can	get	them	talking	and	understanding	each	other	,	the	results	can	be	spectacular	.
you	can	find	novel	solutions	,	really	novel	solutions	,	that	have	never	been	looked	at	before	very	,	very	quickly	and	easily	.
you	can	shortcut	huge	amounts	of	work	simply	by	using	the	extended	knowledge	base	you	have	.
and	as	a	result	,	it	's	an	entirely	different	use	of	the	technology	and	the	knowledge	around	you	.
the	result	of	all	this	is	that	you	can	get	incredibly	quick	progress	on	incredibly	small	budgets	.
i	'm	so	embarrassed	at	how	cheap	it	was	to	get	from	my	idea	to	me	being	implanted	that	i	'm	not	prepared	to	tell	you	what	it	cost	.
because	i	suspect	there	are	absolutely	standard	surgical	treatments	probably	in	the	usa	which	cost	more	for	a	one	-	off	patient	than	the	cost	of	us	getting	from	my	dream	to	my	reality	.
that	's	all	i	want	to	say	,	and	i	've	got	three	minutes	left	.
so	heather	's	going	to	like	me	.
if	you	have	any	questions	,	please	come	up	and	talk	to	me	later	on	.
it	would	be	a	pleasure	to	speak	with	you	.	many	thanks	.
