so	,	about	three	years	ago	i	was	in	london	,	and	somebody	called	howard	burton	came	to	me	and	said	,	i	represent	a	group	of	people	,	and	we	want	to	start	an	institute	in	theoretical	physics	.
we	have	about	120	million	dollars	,	and	we	want	to	do	it	well	.
we	want	to	be	in	the	forefront	fields	,	and	we	want	to	do	it	differently	.
we	want	to	get	out	of	this	thing	where	the	young	people	have	all	the	ideas	,	and	the	old	people	have	all	the	power	and	decide	what	science	gets	done	.
it	took	me	about	25	seconds	to	decide	that	that	was	a	good	idea	.
three	years	later	,	we	have	the	perimeter	institute	for	theoretical	physics	in	waterloo	,	ontario	.	it	's	the	most	exciting	job	i	've	ever	had	.
and	it	's	the	first	time	i	've	had	a	job	where	i	'm	afraid	to	go	away	because	of	everything	that	's	going	to	happen	in	this	week	when	i	'm	here	.
but	in	any	case	,	what	i	'm	going	to	do	in	my	little	bit	of	time	is	take	you	on	a	quick	tour	of	some	of	the	things	that	we	talk	about	and	we	think	about	.
so	,	we	think	a	lot	about	what	really	makes	science	work	?
the	first	thing	that	anybody	who	knows	science	,	and	has	been	around	science	,	is	that	the	stuff	you	learn	in	school	as	a	scientific	method	is	wrong	.	there	is	no	method	.
on	the	other	hand	,	somehow	we	manage	to	reason	together	as	a	community	,	from	incomplete	evidence	to	conclusions	that	we	all	agree	about	.
and	this	is	,	by	the	way	,	something	that	a	democratic	society	also	has	to	do	.
so	how	does	it	work	?
well	,	my	belief	is	that	it	works	because	scientists	are	a	community	bound	together	by	an	ethics	.
and	here	are	some	of	the	ethical	principles	.
i	'm	not	going	to	read	them	all	to	you	because	i	'm	not	in	teacher	mode	.
i	'm	in	entertain	,	amaze	mode	.
but	one	of	the	principles	is	that	everybody	who	is	part	of	the	community	gets	to	fight	and	argue	as	hard	as	they	can	for	what	they	believe	.
but	we	're	all	disciplined	by	the	understanding	that	the	only	people	who	are	going	to	decide	,	you	know	,	whether	i	'm	right	or	somebody	else	is	right	,	are	the	people	in	our	community	in	the	next	generation	,	in	30	and	50	years	.
so	it	's	this	combination	of	respect	for	the	tradition	and	community	we	're	in	,	and	rebellion	that	the	community	requires	to	get	anywhere	,	that	makes	science	work	.
and	being	in	this	process	of	being	in	a	community	that	reasons	from	shared	evidence	to	conclusions	,	i	believe	,	teaches	us	about	democracy	.
not	only	is	there	a	relationship	between	the	ethics	of	science	and	the	ethics	of	being	a	citizen	in	democracy	,	but	there	has	been	,	historically	,	a	relationship	between	how	people	think	about	space	and	time	,	and	what	the	cosmos	is	,	and	how	people	think	about	the	society	that	they	live	in	.
and	i	want	to	talk	about	three	stages	in	that	evolution	.
the	first	science	of	cosmology	that	was	anything	like	science	was	aristotelian	science	,	and	that	was	hierarchical	.
the	earth	is	in	the	center	,	then	there	are	these	crystal	spheres	,	the	sun	,	the	moon	,	the	planets	and	finally	the	celestial	sphere	,	where	the	stars	are	.	and	everything	in	this	universe	has	a	place	.
and	aristotle	's	law	of	motion	was	that	everything	goes	to	its	natural	place	,	which	was	of	course	,	the	rule	of	the	society	that	aristotle	lived	in	,	and	more	importantly	,	the	medieval	society	that	,	through	christianity	,	embraced	aristotle	and	blessed	it	.
and	the	idea	is	that	everything	is	defined	.
where	something	is	,	is	defined	with	respect	to	this	last	sphere	,	the	celestial	sphere	,	outside	of	which	is	this	eternal	,	perfect	realm	,	where	lives	god	,	who	is	the	ultimate	judge	of	everything	.
so	that	is	both	aristotelian	cosmology	,	and	in	a	certain	sense	,	medieval	society	.
now	,	in	the	17th	century	there	was	a	revolution	in	thinking	about	space	and	time	and	motion	and	so	forth	of	newton	.
and	at	the	same	time	there	was	a	revolution	in	social	thought	of	john	locke	and	his	collaborators	.
and	they	were	very	closely	associated	.
in	fact	,	newton	and	locke	were	friends	.
their	way	of	thinking	about	space	and	time	and	motion	on	the	one	hand	,	and	a	society	on	the	other	hand	,	were	closely	related	.
and	let	me	show	you	.
in	a	newtonian	universe	,	there	's	no	center	--	thank	you	.
there	are	particles	and	they	move	around	with	respect	to	a	fixed	,	absolute	framework	of	space	and	time	.
it	's	meaningful	to	say	absolutely	where	something	is	in	space	,	because	that	's	defined	,	not	with	respect	to	say	,	where	other	things	are	,	but	with	respect	to	this	absolute	notion	of	space	,	which	for	newton	was	god	.
now	,	similarly	,	in	locke	's	society	there	are	individuals	who	have	certain	rights	,	properties	in	a	formal	sense	,	and	those	are	defined	with	respect	to	some	absolute	,	abstract	notions	of	rights	and	justice	,	and	so	forth	,	which	are	independent	of	what	else	has	happened	in	the	society	.
of	who	else	there	is	,	of	the	history	and	so	forth	.
there	is	also	an	omniscient	observer	who	knows	everything	,	who	is	god	,	who	is	in	a	certain	sense	outside	the	universe	,	because	he	has	no	role	in	anything	that	happens	,	but	is	in	a	certain	sense	everywhere	,	because	space	is	just	the	way	that	god	knows	where	everything	is	,	according	to	newton	,	ok	?
so	this	is	the	foundations	of	what	's	called	,	traditionally	,	liberal	political	theory	and	newtonian	physics	.
now	,	in	the	20th	century	we	had	a	revolution	that	was	initiated	at	the	beginning	of	the	20th	century	,	and	which	is	still	going	on	.
it	was	begun	with	the	invention	of	relativity	theory	and	quantum	theory	.
and	merging	them	together	to	make	the	final	quantum	theory	of	space	and	time	and	gravity	,	is	the	culmination	of	that	,	something	that	's	going	on	right	now	.
and	in	this	universe	there	's	nothing	fixed	and	absolute	.	zilch	,	ok	.
this	universe	is	described	by	being	a	network	of	relationships	.
space	is	just	one	aspect	,	so	there	's	no	meaning	to	say	absolutely	where	something	is	.
there	's	only	where	it	is	relative	to	everything	else	that	is	.
and	this	network	of	relations	is	ever	-	evolving	.
so	we	call	it	a	relational	universe	.
all	properties	of	things	are	about	these	kinds	of	relationships	.
and	also	,	if	you	're	embedded	in	such	a	network	of	relationships	,	your	view	of	the	world	has	to	do	with	what	information	comes	to	you	through	the	network	of	relations	.
and	there	's	no	place	for	an	omniscient	observer	or	an	outside	intelligence	knowing	everything	and	making	everything	.
so	this	is	general	relativity	,	this	is	quantum	theory	.
this	is	also	,	if	you	talk	to	legal	scholars	,	the	foundations	of	new	ideas	in	legal	thought	.
they	're	thinking	about	the	same	things	.
and	not	only	that	,	they	make	the	analogy	to	relativity	theory	and	cosmology	often	.
so	there	's	an	interesting	discussion	going	on	there	.
this	last	view	of	cosmology	is	called	the	relational	view	.
so	the	main	slogan	here	is	that	there	's	nothing	outside	the	universe	,	which	means	that	there	's	no	place	to	put	an	explanation	for	something	outside	.
so	in	such	a	relational	universe	,	if	you	come	upon	something	that	's	ordered	and	structured	,	like	this	device	here	,	or	that	device	there	,	or	something	beautiful	,	like	all	the	living	things	,	all	of	you	guys	in	the	room	--	``	guys	``	in	physics	,	by	the	way	,	is	a	generic	term	:	men	and	women	.
then	you	want	to	know	,	you	're	a	person	,	you	want	to	know	how	is	it	made	.
and	in	a	relational	universe	the	only	possible	explanation	was	,	somehow	it	made	itself	.
there	must	be	mechanisms	of	self	-	organization	inside	the	universe	that	make	things	.
because	there	's	no	place	to	put	a	maker	outside	,	as	there	was	in	the	aristotelian	and	the	newtonian	universe	.
so	in	a	relational	universe	we	must	have	processes	of	self	-	organization	.
now	,	darwin	taught	us	that	there	are	processes	of	self	-	organization	that	suffice	to	explain	all	of	us	and	everything	we	see	.
so	it	works	.	but	not	only	that	,	if	you	think	about	how	natural	selection	works	,	then	it	turns	out	that	natural	selection	would	only	make	sense	in	such	a	relational	universe	.
that	is	,	natural	selection	works	on	properties	,	like	fitness	,	which	are	about	relationships	of	some	species	to	some	other	species	.
darwin	would	n't	make	sense	in	an	aristotelian	universe	,	and	would	n't	really	make	sense	in	a	newtonian	universe	.
so	a	theory	of	biology	based	on	natural	selection	requires	a	relational	notion	of	what	are	the	properties	of	biological	systems	.
and	if	you	push	that	all	the	way	down	,	really	,	it	makes	the	best	sense	in	a	relational	universe	where	all	properties	are	relational	.
now	,	not	only	that	,	but	einstein	taught	us	that	gravity	is	the	result	of	the	world	being	relational	.
if	it	was	n't	for	gravity	,	there	would	n't	be	life	,	because	gravity	causes	stars	to	form	and	live	for	a	very	long	time	,	keeping	pieces	of	the	world	,	like	the	surface	of	the	earth	,	out	of	thermal	equilibrium	for	billions	of	years	so	life	can	evolve	.
in	the	20th	century	,	we	saw	the	independent	development	of	two	big	themes	in	science	.
in	the	biological	sciences	,	they	explored	the	implications	of	the	notion	that	order	and	complexity	and	structure	arise	in	a	self	-	organized	way	.
that	was	the	triumph	of	neo	-	darwinism	and	so	forth	.
and	slowly	,	that	idea	is	leaking	out	to	the	cognitive	sciences	,	the	human	sciences	,	economics	,	et	cetera	.
at	the	same	time	,	we	physicists	have	been	busy	trying	to	make	sense	of	and	build	on	and	integrate	the	discoveries	of	quantum	theory	and	relativity	.
and	what	we	've	been	working	out	is	the	implications	,	really	,	of	the	idea	that	the	universe	is	made	up	of	relations	.
21st	-	century	science	is	going	to	be	driven	by	the	integration	of	these	two	ideas	:	the	triumph	of	relational	ways	of	thinking	about	the	world	,	on	the	one	hand	,	and	self	-	organization	or	darwinian	ways	of	thinking	about	the	world	,	on	the	other	hand	.
and	also	,	is	that	in	the	21st	century	our	thinking	about	space	and	time	and	cosmology	,	and	our	thinking	about	society	are	both	going	to	continue	to	evolve	.
and	what	they	're	evolving	towards	is	the	union	of	these	two	big	ideas	,	darwinism	and	relationalism	.
now	,	if	you	think	about	democracy	from	this	perspective	,	a	new	pluralistic	notion	of	democracy	would	be	one	that	recognizes	that	there	are	many	different	interests	,	many	different	agendas	,	many	different	individuals	,	many	different	points	of	view	.
each	one	is	incomplete	,	because	you	're	embedded	in	a	network	of	relationships	.
any	actor	in	a	democracy	is	embedded	in	a	network	of	relationships	.
and	you	understand	some	things	better	than	other	things	,	and	because	of	that	there	's	a	continual	jostling	and	give	and	take	,	which	is	politics	.
and	politics	is	,	in	the	ideal	sense	,	the	way	in	which	we	continually	address	our	network	of	relations	in	order	to	achieve	a	better	life	and	a	better	society	.
and	i	also	think	that	science	will	never	go	away	and	--	i	'm	finishing	on	this	line	.
in	fact	,	i	'm	finished	.	science	will	never	go	away	.
