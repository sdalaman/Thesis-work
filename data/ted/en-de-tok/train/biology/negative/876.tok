we	live	in	difficult	and	challenging	economic	times	,	of	course	.
and	one	of	the	first	victims	of	difficult	economic	times	,	i	think	,	is	public	spending	of	any	kind	,	but	certainly	in	the	firing	line	at	the	moment	is	public	spending	for	science	,	and	particularly	curiosity	-	led	science	and	exploration	.
so	i	want	to	try	and	convince	you	in	about	15	minutes	that	that	's	a	ridiculous	and	ludicrous	thing	to	do	.
but	i	think	to	set	the	scene	,	i	want	to	show	--	the	next	slide	is	not	my	attempt	to	show	the	worst	ted	slide	in	the	history	of	ted	,	but	it	is	a	bit	of	a	mess	.
but	actually	,	it	's	not	my	fault	;	it	's	from	the	guardian	newspaper	.
and	it	's	actually	a	beautiful	demonstration	of	how	much	science	costs	.
because	,	if	i	'm	going	to	make	the	case	for	continuing	to	spend	on	curiosity	-	driven	science	and	exploration	,	i	should	tell	you	how	much	it	costs	.
so	this	is	a	game	called	``	spot	the	science	budgets	.	``
this	is	the	u.k.	government	spend	.
you	see	there	,	it	's	about	620	billion	a	year	.
the	science	budget	is	actually	--	if	you	look	to	your	left	,	there	's	a	purple	set	of	blobs	and	then	yellow	set	of	blobs	.
and	it	's	one	of	the	yellow	set	of	blobs	around	the	big	yellow	blob	.
it	's	about	3.3	billion	pounds	per	year	out	of	620	billion	.
that	funds	everything	in	the	u.k	.
from	medical	research	,	space	exploration	,	where	i	work	,	at	cern	in	geneva	,	particle	physics	,	engineering	,	even	arts	and	humanities	,	funded	from	the	science	budget	,	which	is	that	3.3	billion	,	that	little	,	tiny	yellow	blob	around	the	orange	blob	at	the	top	left	of	the	screen	.
so	that	's	what	we	're	arguing	about	.
that	percentage	,	by	the	way	,	is	about	the	same	in	the	u.s.	and	germany	and	france	.
r	&	d	in	total	in	the	economy	,	publicly	funded	,	is	about	0.6	percent	of	gdp	.
so	that	's	what	we	're	arguing	about	.
the	first	thing	i	want	to	say	,	and	this	is	straight	from	``	wonders	of	the	solar	system	,	``	is	that	our	exploration	of	the	solar	system	and	the	universe	has	shown	us	that	it	is	indescribably	beautiful	.
this	is	a	picture	that	actually	was	sent	back	by	the	cassini	space	probe	around	saturn	,	after	we	'd	finished	filming	``	wonders	of	the	solar	system	.	``
so	it	is	n't	in	the	series	.
it	's	of	the	moon	enceladus	.
so	that	big	sweeping	,	white	sphere	in	the	corner	is	saturn	,	which	is	actually	in	the	background	of	the	picture	.
and	that	crescent	there	is	the	moon	enceladus	,	which	is	about	as	big	as	the	british	isles	.
it	's	about	500	kilometers	in	diameter	.
so	,	tiny	moon	.
what	's	fascinating	and	beautiful	...
this	an	unprocessed	picture	,	by	the	way	,	i	should	say	,	it	's	black	and	white	,	straight	from	saturnian	orbit	.
what	's	beautiful	is	,	you	can	probably	see	on	the	limb	there	some	faint	,	sort	of	,	wisps	of	almost	smoke	rising	up	from	the	limb	.
this	is	how	we	visualize	that	in	``	wonders	of	the	solar	system	.	``
it	's	a	beautiful	graphic	.
what	we	found	out	were	that	those	faint	wisps	are	actually	fountains	of	ice	rising	up	from	the	surface	of	this	tiny	moon	.
that	's	fascinating	and	beautiful	in	itself	,	but	we	think	that	the	mechanism	for	powering	those	fountains	requires	there	to	be	lakes	of	liquid	water	beneath	the	surface	of	this	moon	.
and	what	's	important	about	that	is	that	,	on	our	planet	,	on	earth	,	wherever	we	find	liquid	water	,	we	find	life	.
so	,	to	find	strong	evidence	of	liquid	,	pools	of	liquid	,	beneath	the	surface	of	a	moon	750	million	miles	away	from	the	earth	is	really	quite	astounding	.
so	what	we	're	saying	,	essentially	,	is	maybe	that	's	a	habitat	for	life	in	the	solar	system	.
well	,	let	me	just	say	,	that	was	a	graphic	.	i	just	want	to	show	this	picture	.
that	's	one	more	picture	of	enceladus	.
this	is	when	cassini	flew	beneath	enceladus	.
so	it	made	a	very	low	pass	,	just	a	few	hundred	kilometers	above	the	surface	.
and	so	this	,	again	,	a	real	picture	of	the	ice	fountains	rising	up	into	space	,	absolutely	beautiful	.
but	that	's	not	the	prime	candidate	for	life	in	the	solar	system	.
that	's	probably	this	place	,	which	is	a	moon	of	jupiter	,	europa	.
and	again	,	we	had	to	fly	to	the	jovian	system	to	get	any	sense	that	this	moon	,	as	most	moons	,	was	anything	other	than	a	dead	ball	of	rock	.
it	's	actually	an	ice	moon	.
so	what	you	're	looking	at	is	the	surface	of	the	moon	europa	,	which	is	a	thick	sheet	of	ice	,	probably	a	hundred	kilometers	thick	.
but	by	measuring	the	way	that	europa	interacts	with	the	magnetic	field	of	jupiter	,	and	looking	at	how	those	cracks	in	the	ice	that	you	can	see	there	on	that	graphic	move	around	,	we	've	inferred	very	strongly	that	there	's	an	ocean	of	liquid	surrounding	the	entire	surface	of	europa	.
so	below	the	ice	,	there	's	an	ocean	of	liquid	around	the	whole	moon	.
it	could	be	hundreds	of	kilometers	deep	,	we	think	.
we	think	it	's	saltwater	,	and	that	would	mean	that	there	's	more	water	on	that	moon	of	jupiter	than	there	is	in	all	the	oceans	of	the	earth	combined	.
so	that	place	,	a	little	moon	around	jupiter	,	is	probably	the	prime	candidate	for	finding	life	on	a	moon	or	a	body	outside	the	earth	,	that	we	know	of	.
tremendous	and	beautiful	discovery	.
our	exploration	of	the	solar	system	has	taught	us	that	the	solar	system	is	beautiful	.
it	may	also	have	pointed	the	way	to	answering	one	of	the	most	profound	questions	that	you	can	possibly	ask	,	which	is	:	``	are	we	alone	in	the	universe	?	``
is	there	any	other	use	to	exploration	and	science	,	other	than	just	a	sense	of	wonder	?
well	,	there	is	.
this	is	a	very	famous	picture	taken	,	actually	,	on	my	first	christmas	eve	,	december	24th	,	1968	,	when	i	was	about	eight	months	old	.
it	was	taken	by	apollo	8	as	it	went	around	the	back	of	the	moon	.
earthrise	from	apollo	8	.
a	famous	picture	;	many	people	have	said	that	it	's	the	picture	that	saved	1968	,	which	was	a	turbulent	year	--	the	student	riots	in	paris	,	the	height	of	the	vietnam	war	.
the	reason	many	people	think	that	about	this	picture	,	and	al	gore	has	said	it	many	times	,	actually	,	on	the	stage	at	ted	,	is	that	this	picture	,	arguably	,	was	the	beginning	of	the	environmental	movement	.
because	,	for	the	first	time	,	we	saw	our	world	,	not	as	a	solid	,	immovable	,	kind	of	indestructible	place	,	but	as	a	very	small	,	fragile	-	looking	world	just	hanging	against	the	blackness	of	space	.
what	's	also	not	often	said	about	the	space	exploration	,	about	the	apollo	program	,	is	the	economic	contribution	it	made	.
i	mean	while	you	can	make	arguments	that	it	was	wonderful	and	a	tremendous	achievement	and	delivered	pictures	like	this	,	it	cost	a	lot	,	did	n't	it	?
well	,	actually	,	many	studies	have	been	done	about	the	economic	effectiveness	,	the	economic	impact	of	apollo	.
the	biggest	one	was	in	1975	by	chase	econometrics	.
and	it	showed	that	for	every	$	1	spent	on	apollo	,	14	came	back	into	the	u.s.	economy	.
so	the	apollo	program	paid	for	itself	in	inspiration	,	in	engineering	,	achievement	and	,	i	think	,	in	inspiring	young	scientists	and	engineers	14	times	over	.
so	exploration	can	pay	for	itself	.
what	about	scientific	discovery	?
what	about	driving	innovation	?
well	,	this	looks	like	a	picture	of	virtually	nothing	.
what	it	is	,	is	a	picture	of	the	spectrum	of	hydrogen	.
see	,	back	in	the	1880s	,	1890s	,	many	scientists	,	many	observers	,	looked	at	the	light	given	off	from	atoms	.
and	they	saw	strange	pictures	like	this	.
what	you	're	seeing	when	you	put	it	through	a	prism	is	that	you	heat	hydrogen	up	and	it	does	n't	just	glow	like	a	white	light	,	it	just	emits	light	at	particular	colors	,	a	red	one	,	a	light	blue	one	,	some	dark	blue	ones	.
now	that	led	to	an	understanding	of	atomic	structure	because	the	way	that	's	explained	is	atoms	are	a	single	nucleus	with	electrons	going	around	them	.
and	the	electrons	can	only	be	in	particular	places	.
and	when	they	jump	up	to	the	next	place	they	can	be	,	and	fall	back	down	again	,	they	emit	light	at	particular	colors	.
and	so	the	fact	that	atoms	,	when	you	heat	them	up	,	only	emit	light	at	very	specific	colors	,	was	one	of	the	key	drivers	that	led	to	the	development	of	the	quantum	theory	,	the	theory	of	the	structure	of	atoms	.
i	just	wanted	to	show	this	picture	because	this	is	remarkable	.
this	is	actually	a	picture	of	the	spectrum	of	the	sun	.
and	now	,	this	is	a	picture	of	atoms	in	the	sun	's	atmosphere	absorbing	light	.
and	again	,	they	only	absorb	light	at	particular	colors	when	electrons	jump	up	and	fall	down	,	jump	up	and	fall	down	.
but	look	at	the	number	of	black	lines	in	that	spectrum	.
and	the	element	helium	was	discovered	just	by	staring	at	the	light	from	the	sun	because	some	of	those	black	lines	were	found	that	corresponded	to	no	known	element	.
and	that	's	why	helium	's	called	helium	.
it	's	called	``	helios	``	--	helios	from	the	sun	.
now	,	that	sounds	esoteric	,	and	indeed	it	was	an	esoteric	pursuit	,	but	the	quantum	theory	quickly	led	to	an	understanding	of	the	behaviors	of	electrons	in	materials	like	silicon	,	for	example	.
the	way	that	silicon	behaves	,	the	fact	that	you	can	build	transistors	,	is	a	purely	quantum	phenomenon	.
so	without	that	curiosity	-	driven	understanding	of	the	structure	of	atoms	,	which	led	to	this	rather	esoteric	theory	,	quantum	mechanics	,	then	we	would	n't	have	transistors	,	we	would	n't	have	silicon	chips	,	we	would	n't	have	pretty	much	the	basis	of	our	modern	economy	.
there	's	one	more	,	i	think	,	wonderful	twist	to	that	tale	.
in	``	wonders	of	the	solar	system	,	``	we	kept	emphasizing	the	laws	of	physics	are	universal	.
it	's	one	of	the	most	incredible	things	about	the	physics	and	the	understanding	of	nature	that	you	get	on	earth	,	is	you	can	transport	it	,	not	only	to	the	planets	,	but	to	the	most	distant	stars	and	galaxies	.
and	one	of	the	astonishing	predictions	of	quantum	mechanics	,	just	by	looking	at	the	structure	of	atoms	--	the	same	theory	that	describes	transistors	--	is	that	there	can	be	no	stars	in	the	universe	that	have	reached	the	end	of	their	life	that	are	bigger	than	,	quite	specifically	,	1.4	times	the	mass	of	the	sun	.
that	's	a	limit	imposed	on	the	mass	of	stars	.
you	can	work	it	out	on	a	piece	of	paper	in	a	laboratory	,	get	a	telescope	,	swing	it	to	the	sky	,	and	you	find	that	there	are	no	dead	stars	bigger	than	1.4	times	the	mass	of	the	sun	.
that	's	quite	an	incredible	prediction	.
what	happens	when	you	have	a	star	that	's	right	on	the	edge	of	that	mass	?
well	,	this	is	a	picture	of	it	.
this	is	the	picture	of	a	galaxy	,	a	common	``	our	garden	``	galaxy	with	,	what	,	100	billion	stars	like	our	sun	in	it	.
it	's	just	one	of	billions	of	galaxies	in	the	universe	.
there	are	a	billion	stars	in	the	galactic	core	,	which	is	why	it	's	shining	out	so	brightly	.
this	is	about	50	million	light	years	away	,	so	one	of	our	neighboring	galaxies	.
but	that	bright	star	there	is	actually	one	of	the	stars	in	the	galaxy	.
so	that	star	is	also	50	million	light	years	away	.
it	's	part	of	that	galaxy	,	and	it	's	shining	as	brightly	as	the	center	of	the	galaxy	with	a	billion	suns	in	it	.
that	's	a	type	ia	supernova	explosion	.
now	that	's	an	incredible	phenomena	,	because	it	's	a	star	that	sits	there	.
it	's	called	a	carbon	-	oxygen	dwarf	.
it	sits	there	about	,	say	,	1.3	times	the	mass	of	the	sun	.
and	it	has	a	binary	companion	that	goes	around	it	,	so	a	big	star	,	a	big	ball	of	gas	.
and	what	it	does	is	it	sucks	gas	off	its	companion	star	,	until	it	gets	to	this	limit	called	the	chandrasekhar	limit	,	and	then	it	explodes	.
and	it	explodes	,	and	it	shines	as	brightly	as	a	billion	suns	for	about	two	weeks	,	and	releases	,	not	only	energy	,	but	a	huge	amount	of	chemical	elements	into	the	universe	.
in	fact	,	that	one	is	a	carbon	-	oxygen	dwarf	.
now	,	there	was	no	carbon	and	oxygen	in	the	universe	at	the	big	bang	.
and	there	was	no	carbon	and	oxygen	in	the	universe	throughout	the	first	generation	of	stars	.
it	was	made	in	stars	like	that	,	locked	away	and	then	returned	to	the	universe	in	explosions	like	that	in	order	to	recondense	into	planets	,	stars	,	new	solar	systems	and	,	indeed	,	people	like	us	.
i	think	that	's	a	remarkable	demonstration	of	the	power	and	beauty	and	universality	of	the	laws	of	physics	,	because	we	understand	that	process	,	because	we	understand	the	structure	of	atoms	here	on	earth	.
this	is	a	beautiful	quote	that	i	found	--	we	're	talking	about	serendipity	there	--	from	alexander	fleming	:	``	when	i	woke	up	just	after	dawn	on	september	28	,	1928	,	i	certainly	did	n't	plan	to	revolutionize	all	medicine	by	discovering	the	world	's	first	antibiotic	.	``
now	,	the	explorers	of	the	world	of	the	atom	did	not	intend	to	invent	the	transistor	.
and	they	certainly	did	n't	intend	to	describe	the	mechanics	of	supernova	explosions	,	which	eventually	told	us	where	the	building	blocks	of	life	were	synthesized	in	the	universe	.
so	,	i	think	science	can	be	--	serendipity	is	important	.
it	can	be	beautiful	.	it	can	reveal	quite	astonishing	things	.
it	can	also	,	i	think	,	finally	reveal	the	most	profound	ideas	to	us	about	our	place	in	the	universe	and	really	the	value	of	our	home	planet	.
this	is	a	spectacular	picture	of	our	home	planet	.
now	,	it	does	n't	look	like	our	home	planet	.
it	looks	like	saturn	because	,	of	course	,	it	is	.
it	was	taken	by	the	cassini	space	probe	.
but	it	's	a	famous	picture	,	not	because	of	the	beauty	and	majesty	of	saturn	's	rings	,	but	actually	because	of	a	tiny	,	faint	blob	just	hanging	underneath	one	of	the	rings	.
and	if	i	blow	it	up	there	,	you	see	it	.
it	looks	like	a	moon	,	but	in	fact	,	it	's	a	picture	of	earth	.
it	was	a	picture	of	earth	captured	in	that	frame	of	saturn	.
that	's	our	planet	from	750	million	miles	away	.
i	think	the	earth	has	got	a	strange	property	that	the	farther	away	you	get	from	it	,	the	more	beautiful	it	seems	.
but	that	is	not	the	most	distant	or	most	famous	picture	of	our	planet	.
it	was	taken	by	this	thing	,	which	is	called	the	voyager	spacecraft	.
and	that	's	a	picture	of	me	in	front	of	it	for	scale	.
the	voyager	is	a	tiny	machine	.
it	's	currently	10	billion	miles	away	from	earth	,	transmitting	with	that	dish	,	with	the	power	of	20	watts	,	and	we	're	still	in	contact	with	it	.
but	it	visited	jupiter	,	saturn	,	uranus	and	neptune	.
and	after	it	visited	all	four	of	those	planets	,	carl	sagan	,	who	's	one	of	my	great	heroes	,	had	the	wonderful	idea	of	turning	voyager	around	and	taking	a	picture	of	every	planet	it	had	visited	.
and	it	took	this	picture	of	earth	.
now	it	's	very	hard	to	see	the	earth	there	,	it	's	called	the	``	pale	blue	dot	``	picture	,	but	earth	is	suspended	in	that	red	shaft	of	light	.
that	's	earth	from	four	billion	miles	away	.
and	i	'd	like	to	read	you	what	sagan	wrote	about	it	,	just	to	finish	,	because	i	can	not	say	words	as	beautiful	as	this	to	describe	what	he	saw	in	that	picture	that	he	had	taken	.
he	said	,	``	consider	again	that	dot	.
that	's	here	.	that	's	home	.	that	's	us	.
on	it	,	everyone	you	love	,	everyone	you	know	,	everyone	you	've	ever	heard	of	,	every	human	being	who	ever	was	lived	out	their	lives	.
the	aggregates	of	joy	and	suffering	thousands	of	confident	religions	,	ideologies	and	economic	doctrines	,	every	hunter	and	forager	,	every	hero	and	coward	,	every	creator	and	destroyer	of	civilization	,	every	king	and	peasant	,	every	young	couple	in	love	,	every	mother	and	father	,	hopeful	child	,	inventor	and	explorer	,	every	teacher	of	morals	,	every	corrupt	politician	,	every	superstar	,	every	supreme	leader	,	every	saint	and	sinner	in	the	history	of	our	species	,	lived	there	,	on	a	mote	of	dust	,	suspended	in	a	sunbeam	.
it	's	been	said	that	astronomy	's	a	humbling	and	character	-	building	experience	.
there	is	perhaps	no	better	demonstration	of	the	folly	of	human	conceits	than	this	distant	image	of	our	tiny	world	.
to	me	,	it	underscores	our	responsibility	to	deal	more	kindly	with	one	another	and	to	preserve	and	cherish	the	pale	blue	dot	,	the	only	home	we	've	ever	known	.	``
beautiful	words	about	the	power	of	science	and	exploration	.
the	argument	has	always	been	made	,	and	it	will	always	be	made	,	that	we	know	enough	about	the	universe	.
you	could	have	made	it	in	the	1920s	;	you	would	n't	have	had	penicillin	.
you	could	have	made	it	in	the	1890s	;	you	would	n't	have	the	transistor	.
and	it	's	made	today	in	these	difficult	economic	times	.
surely	,	we	know	enough	.
we	do	n't	need	to	discover	anything	else	about	our	universe	.
let	me	leave	the	last	words	to	someone	who	's	rapidly	becoming	a	hero	of	mine	,	humphrey	davy	,	who	did	his	science	at	the	turn	of	the	19th	century	.
he	was	clearly	under	assault	all	the	time	.
``	we	know	enough	at	the	turn	of	the	19th	century	.
just	exploit	it	;	just	build	things	.	``
he	said	this	,	he	said	,	``	nothing	is	more	fatal	to	the	progress	of	the	human	mind	than	to	presume	that	our	views	of	science	are	ultimate	,	that	our	triumphs	are	complete	,	that	there	are	no	mysteries	in	nature	,	and	that	there	are	no	new	worlds	to	conquer	.	``
thank	you	.
