what	i	thought	i	would	do	is	i	would	start	with	a	simple	request	.
i	'd	like	all	of	you	to	pause	for	a	moment	,	you	wretched	weaklings	,	and	take	stock	of	your	miserable	existence	.
now	that	was	the	advice	that	st.	benedict	gave	his	rather	startled	followers	in	the	fifth	century	.
it	was	the	advice	that	i	decided	to	follow	myself	when	i	turned	40	.
up	until	that	moment	,	i	had	been	that	classic	corporate	warrior	--	i	was	eating	too	much	,	i	was	drinking	too	much	,	i	was	working	too	hard	and	i	was	neglecting	the	family	.
and	i	decided	that	i	would	try	and	turn	my	life	around	.
in	particular	,	i	decided	i	would	try	to	address	the	thorny	issue	of	work	-	life	balance	.
so	i	stepped	back	from	the	workforce	,	and	i	spent	a	year	at	home	with	my	wife	and	four	young	children	.
but	all	i	learned	about	work	-	life	balance	from	that	year	was	that	i	found	it	quite	easy	to	balance	work	and	life	when	i	did	n't	have	any	work	.
not	a	very	useful	skill	,	especially	when	the	money	runs	out	.
so	i	went	back	to	work	,	and	i	've	spent	these	seven	years	since	struggling	with	,	studying	and	writing	about	work	-	life	balance	.
and	i	have	four	observations	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	today	.
the	first	is	:	if	society	's	to	make	any	progress	on	this	issue	,	we	need	an	honest	debate	.
but	the	trouble	is	so	many	people	talk	so	much	rubbish	about	work	-	life	balance	.
all	the	discussions	about	flexi	-	time	or	dress	-	down	fridays	or	paternity	leave	only	serve	to	mask	the	core	issue	,	which	is	that	certain	job	and	career	choices	are	fundamentally	incompatible	with	being	meaningfully	engaged	on	a	day	-	to	-	day	basis	with	a	young	family	.
now	the	first	step	in	solving	any	problem	is	acknowledging	the	reality	of	the	situation	you	're	in	.
and	the	reality	of	the	society	that	we	're	in	is	there	are	thousands	and	thousands	of	people	out	there	leading	lives	of	quiet	,	screaming	desperation	,	where	they	work	long	,	hard	hours	at	jobs	they	hate	to	enable	them	to	buy	things	they	do	n't	need	to	impress	people	they	do	n't	like	.
it	's	my	contention	that	going	to	work	on	friday	in	jeans	and	[	a	]	t	-	shirt	is	n't	really	getting	to	the	nub	of	the	issue	.
the	second	observation	i	'd	like	to	make	is	we	need	to	face	the	truth	that	governments	and	corporations	are	n't	going	to	solve	this	issue	for	us	.
we	should	stop	looking	outside	.
it	's	up	to	us	as	individuals	to	take	control	and	responsibility	for	the	type	of	lives	that	we	want	to	lead	.
if	you	do	n't	design	your	life	,	someone	else	will	design	it	for	you	,	and	you	may	just	not	like	their	idea	of	balance	.
it	's	particularly	important	--	this	is	n't	on	the	world	wide	web	,	is	it	?	i	'm	about	to	get	fired	--	it	's	particularly	important	that	you	never	put	the	quality	of	your	life	in	the	hands	of	a	commercial	corporation	.
now	i	'm	not	talking	here	just	about	the	bad	companies	--	the	``	abattoirs	of	the	human	soul	,	``	as	i	call	them	.
i	'm	talking	about	all	companies	.
because	commercial	companies	are	inherently	designed	to	get	as	much	out	of	you	[	as	]	they	can	get	away	with	.
it	's	in	their	nature	;	it	's	in	their	dna	;	it	's	what	they	do	--	even	the	good	,	well	-	intentioned	companies	.
on	the	one	hand	,	putting	childcare	facilities	in	the	workplace	is	wonderful	and	enlightened	.
on	the	other	hand	,	it	's	a	nightmare	--	it	just	means	you	spend	more	time	at	the	bloody	office	.
we	have	to	be	responsible	for	setting	and	enforcing	the	boundaries	that	we	want	in	our	life	.
the	third	observation	is	we	have	to	be	careful	with	the	time	frame	that	we	choose	upon	which	to	judge	our	balance	.
before	i	went	back	to	work	after	my	year	at	home	,	i	sat	down	and	i	wrote	out	a	detailed	,	step	-	by	-	step	description	of	the	ideal	balanced	day	that	i	aspired	to	.
and	it	went	like	this	:	wake	up	well	rested	after	a	good	night	's	sleep	.
have	sex	.
walk	the	dog	.
have	breakfast	with	my	wife	and	children	.
have	sex	again	.
drive	the	kids	to	school	on	the	way	to	the	office	.
do	three	hours	'	work	.
play	a	sport	with	a	friend	at	lunchtime	.
do	another	three	hours	'	work	.
meet	some	mates	in	the	pub	for	an	early	evening	drink	.
drive	home	for	dinner	with	my	wife	and	kids	.
meditate	for	half	an	hour	.
have	sex	.
walk	the	dog	.	have	sex	again	.
go	to	bed	.
how	often	do	you	think	i	have	that	day	?
we	need	to	be	realistic	.
you	ca	n't	do	it	all	in	one	day	.
we	need	to	elongate	the	time	frame	upon	which	we	judge	the	balance	in	our	life	,	but	we	need	to	elongate	it	without	falling	into	the	trap	of	the	``	i	'll	have	a	life	when	i	retire	,	when	my	kids	have	left	home	,	when	my	wife	has	divorced	me	,	my	health	is	failing	,	i	've	got	no	mates	or	interests	left	.	``
a	day	is	too	short	;	``	after	i	retire	``	is	too	long	.
there	's	got	to	be	a	middle	way	.
a	fourth	observation	:	we	need	to	approach	balance	in	a	balanced	way	.
a	friend	came	to	see	me	last	year	--	and	she	does	n't	mind	me	telling	this	story	--	a	friend	came	to	see	me	last	year	and	said	,	``	nigel	,	i	've	read	your	book	.
and	i	realize	that	my	life	is	completely	out	of	balance	.
it	's	totally	dominated	by	work	.
i	work	10	hours	a	day	;	i	commute	two	hours	a	day	.
all	of	my	relationships	have	failed	.
there	's	nothing	in	my	life	apart	from	my	work	.
so	i	've	decided	to	get	a	grip	and	sort	it	out	.
so	i	joined	a	gym	.	``
now	i	do	n't	mean	to	mock	,	but	being	a	fit	10	-	hour	-	a	-	day	office	rat	is	n't	more	balanced	;	it	's	more	fit	.
lovely	though	physical	exercise	may	be	,	there	are	other	parts	to	life	--	there	's	the	intellectual	side	;	there	's	the	emotional	side	;	there	's	the	spiritual	side	.
and	to	be	balanced	,	i	believe	we	have	to	attend	to	all	of	those	areas	--	not	just	do	50	stomach	crunches	.
now	that	can	be	daunting	.
because	people	say	,	``	bloody	hell	mate	,	i	have	n't	got	time	to	get	fit	.
you	want	me	to	go	to	church	and	call	my	mother	.	``
and	i	understand	.
i	truly	understand	how	that	can	be	daunting	.
but	an	incident	that	happened	a	couple	of	years	ago	gave	me	a	new	perspective	.
my	wife	,	who	is	somewhere	in	the	audience	today	,	called	me	up	at	the	office	and	said	,	``	nigel	,	you	need	to	pick	our	youngest	son	``	--	harry	--	``	up	from	school	.	``
because	she	had	to	be	somewhere	else	with	the	other	three	children	for	that	evening	.
so	i	left	work	an	hour	early	that	afternoon	and	picked	harry	up	at	the	school	gates	.
we	walked	down	to	the	local	park	,	messed	around	on	the	swings	,	played	some	silly	games	.
i	then	walked	him	up	the	hill	to	the	local	cafe	,	and	we	shared	a	pizza	for	two	,	then	walked	down	the	hill	to	our	home	,	and	i	gave	him	his	bath	and	put	him	in	his	batman	pajamas	.
i	then	read	him	a	chapter	of	roald	dahl	's	``	james	and	the	giant	peach	.	``
i	then	put	him	to	bed	,	tucked	him	in	,	gave	him	a	kiss	on	his	forehead	and	said	,	``	goodnight	,	mate	,	``	and	walked	out	of	his	bedroom	.
as	i	was	walking	out	of	his	bedroom	,	he	said	,	``	dad	?	``	i	went	,	``	yes	,	mate	?	``
he	went	,	``	dad	,	this	has	been	the	best	day	of	my	life	,	ever	.	``
i	had	n't	done	anything	,	had	n't	taken	him	to	disney	world	or	bought	him	a	playstation	.
now	my	point	is	the	small	things	matter	.
being	more	balanced	does	n't	mean	dramatic	upheaval	in	your	life	.
with	the	smallest	investment	in	the	right	places	,	you	can	radically	transform	the	quality	of	your	relationships	and	the	quality	of	your	life	.
moreover	,	i	think	,	it	can	transform	society	.
because	if	enough	people	do	it	,	we	can	change	society	's	definition	of	success	away	from	the	moronically	simplistic	notion	that	the	person	with	the	most	money	when	he	dies	wins	,	to	a	more	thoughtful	and	balanced	definition	of	what	a	life	well	lived	looks	like	.
and	that	,	i	think	,	is	an	idea	worth	spreading	.
