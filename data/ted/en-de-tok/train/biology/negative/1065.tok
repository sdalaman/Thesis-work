i	'm	going	to	have	a	pretty	simple	idea	that	i	'm	just	going	to	tell	you	over	and	over	until	i	get	you	to	believe	it	,	and	that	is	all	of	us	are	makers	.
i	really	believe	that	.
all	of	us	are	makers	.
we	're	born	makers	.
we	have	this	ability	to	make	things	,	to	grasp	things	with	our	hands	.
we	use	words	like	``	grasp	``	metaphorically	to	also	think	about	understanding	things	.
we	do	n't	just	live	,	but	we	make	.
we	create	things	.
well	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	group	of	makers	from	maker	faire	and	various	places	.
it	does	n't	come	out	particularly	well	,	but	that	's	a	particularly	tall	bicycle	.
it	's	a	scraper	bike	;	it	's	called	--	from	oakland	.
and	this	is	a	particularly	small	scooter	for	a	gentleman	of	this	size	.
but	he	's	trying	to	power	it	,	or	motorize	it	,	and	the	question	he	had	is	,	``	can	i	do	it	?	can	it	be	done	?	``
apparently	it	can	.
so	makers	are	enthusiasts	;	they	're	amateurs	;	they	're	people	who	love	doing	what	they	do	.
they	do	n't	always	even	know	why	they	're	doing	it	.
we	have	begun	organizing	makers	at	our	maker	faire	.
there	was	one	held	in	detroit	here	last	summer	,	and	it	will	be	held	again	next	summer	,	at	the	henry	ford	.
but	we	hold	them	in	san	francisco	--	--	and	in	new	york	.
and	it	's	a	fabulous	event	to	just	meet	and	talk	to	these	people	who	make	things	and	are	there	to	just	show	them	to	you	and	talk	about	them	and	have	a	great	conversation	.
guy	:	i	might	get	one	of	those	.
dale	dougherty	:	these	are	electric	muffins	.
guy	:	where	did	you	guys	get	those	?
muffin	:	will	you	glide	with	us	?
dd	:	i	know	ford	has	new	electric	vehicles	coming	out	.
we	got	there	first	.
lady	:	will	you	glide	with	us	?
dd	:	this	is	something	i	call	``	swinging	in	the	rain	.	``
and	you	can	barely	see	it	,	but	it	's	--	a	controller	at	top	cycles	the	water	to	fall	just	before	and	after	you	pass	through	the	bottom	of	the	arc	.
so	imagine	a	kid	:	``	am	i	going	to	get	wet	?	am	i	going	to	get	wet	?
no	,	i	did	n't	get	wet	.	am	i	going	to	get	wet	?	am	i	going	to	get	wet	?	``
that	's	the	experience	of	a	clever	ride	.
and	of	course	,	we	have	fashion	.
people	are	remaking	things	into	fashion	.
i	do	n't	know	if	this	is	called	a	basket	-	bra	,	but	it	ought	to	be	something	like	that	.
we	have	art	students	getting	together	,	taking	old	radiator	parts	and	doing	an	iron	-	pour	to	make	something	new	out	of	it	.
they	did	that	in	the	summer	,	and	it	was	very	warm	.
now	this	one	takes	a	little	bit	of	explaining	.
you	know	what	those	are	,	right	?
billy	-	bob	,	or	billy	bass	,	or	something	like	that	.
now	the	background	is	--	the	guy	who	did	this	is	a	physicist	.
and	here	he	'll	explain	a	little	bit	about	what	it	does	.
richard	carter	:	i	'm	richard	carter	,	and	this	is	the	sashimi	tabernacle	choir	.
choir	:	♫	when	you	hold	me	in	your	arms	♫	dd	:	this	is	all	computer	-	controlled	in	an	old	volvo	.
choir	:	♫	i	'm	hooked	on	a	feelin	'	♫	♫	i	'm	high	on	believin	'	♫	♫	that	you	're	in	love	with	me	♫	dd	:	so	richard	came	up	from	houston	last	year	to	visit	us	in	detroit	here	and	show	the	wonderful	sashimi	tabernacle	choir	.
so	,	are	you	a	maker	?
how	many	people	here	would	say	you	're	a	maker	,	if	you	raise	your	hand	?
that	's	a	pretty	good	--	but	there	's	some	of	you	out	there	that	wo	n't	admit	that	you	're	makers	.
and	again	,	think	about	it	.
you	're	makers	of	food	;	you	're	makers	of	shelter	;	you	're	makers	of	lots	of	different	things	,	and	partly	what	interests	me	today	is	you	're	makers	of	your	own	world	,	and	particularly	the	role	that	technology	has	in	your	life	.
you	're	really	a	driver	or	a	passenger	--	to	use	a	volkswagen	phrase	.
makers	are	in	control	.
that	's	what	fascinates	them	.	that	's	why	they	do	what	they	do	.
they	want	to	figure	out	how	things	work	;	they	want	to	get	access	to	it	;	and	they	want	to	control	it	.
they	want	to	use	it	to	their	own	purpose	.
makers	today	,	to	some	degree	,	are	out	on	the	edge	.
they	're	not	mainstream	.
they	're	a	little	bit	radical	.
they	're	a	bit	subversive	in	what	they	do	.
but	at	one	time	,	it	was	fairly	commonplace	to	think	of	yourself	as	a	maker	.
it	was	not	something	you	'd	even	remark	upon	.
and	i	found	this	old	video	.
and	i	'll	tell	you	more	about	it	,	but	just	...
narrator	:	of	all	things	americans	are	,	we	are	makers	.
with	our	strengths	and	our	minds	and	spirit	,	we	gather	,	we	form	,	and	we	fashion	.
makers	and	shapers	and	put	-	it	-	togetherers	.
dd	:	so	it	goes	on	to	show	you	people	making	things	out	of	wood	,	a	grandfather	making	a	ship	in	a	bottle	,	a	woman	making	a	pie	--	somewhat	standard	fare	of	the	day	.
but	it	was	a	sense	of	pride	that	we	made	things	,	that	the	world	around	us	was	made	by	us	.
it	did	n't	just	exist	.
we	made	it	,	and	we	were	connected	to	it	that	way	.
and	i	think	that	's	tremendously	important	.
now	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	one	funny	thing	about	this	.
this	particular	reel	--	it	's	an	industrial	video	--	but	it	was	shown	in	drive	-	in	theaters	in	1961	--	in	the	detroit	area	,	in	fact	--	and	it	preceded	alfred	hitchcock	's	``	psycho	.	``
so	i	like	to	think	there	was	something	going	on	there	of	the	new	generation	of	makers	coming	out	of	this	,	plus	``	psycho	.	``
this	is	andrew	archer	.
i	met	andrew	at	one	of	our	community	meetings	putting	together	maker	faire	.
andrew	had	moved	to	detroit	from	duluth	,	minnesota	.
and	i	talked	to	his	mom	,	and	i	ended	up	doing	a	story	on	him	for	a	magazine	called	kidrobot	.
he	's	just	a	kid	that	grew	up	playing	with	tools	instead	of	toys	.
he	liked	to	take	things	apart	.
his	mother	gave	him	a	part	of	the	garage	,	and	he	collected	things	from	yard	sales	,	and	he	made	stuff	.
and	then	he	did	n't	particularly	like	school	that	much	,	but	he	got	involved	in	robotics	competitions	,	and	he	realized	he	had	a	talent	,	and	,	more	importantly	,	he	had	a	real	passion	for	it	.
and	he	began	building	robots	.
and	when	i	sat	down	next	to	him	,	he	was	telling	me	about	a	company	he	formed	,	and	he	was	building	some	robots	for	automobile	factories	to	move	things	around	on	the	factory	floor	.
and	that	's	why	he	moved	to	michigan	.
but	he	also	moved	here	to	meet	other	people	doing	what	he	's	doing	.
and	this	kind	of	gets	to	this	important	idea	today	.
this	is	jeff	and	bilal	and	several	others	here	in	a	hackerspace	.
and	there	's	about	three	hackerspaces	or	more	in	detroit	.
and	there	's	probably	even	some	new	ones	since	i	've	been	here	last	.
but	these	are	like	clubs	--	they	're	sharing	tools	,	sharing	space	,	sharing	expertise	in	what	to	make	.
and	so	it	's	a	very	interesting	phenomenon	that	's	going	across	the	world	.
but	essentially	these	are	people	that	are	playing	with	technology	.
let	me	say	that	again	:	playing	.
they	do	n't	necessarily	know	what	they	're	doing	or	why	they	're	doing	it	.
they	're	playing	to	discover	what	the	technology	can	do	,	and	probably	to	discover	what	they	can	do	themselves	,	what	their	own	capabilities	are	.
now	the	other	thing	that	i	think	is	taking	off	,	another	reason	making	is	taking	off	today	,	is	there	's	some	great	new	tools	out	there	.
and	you	ca	n't	see	this	very	well	on	the	screen	,	but	arduino	--	arduino	is	an	open	-	source	hardware	platform	.
it	's	a	micro	-	controller	.
if	you	do	n't	know	what	those	are	,	they	're	just	the	``	brains	.	``
so	they	're	the	brains	of	maker	projects	,	and	here	's	an	example	of	one	.
and	i	do	n't	know	if	you	can	see	it	that	well	,	but	that	's	a	mailbox	--	so	an	ordinary	mailbox	and	an	arduino	.
so	you	figure	out	how	to	program	this	,	and	you	put	this	in	your	mailbox	.
and	when	someone	opens	your	mailbox	,	you	get	a	notification	,	an	alert	message	goes	to	your	iphone	.
now	that	could	be	a	dog	door	,	it	could	be	someone	going	somewhere	where	they	should	n't	,	like	a	little	brother	into	a	little	sister	's	room	.
there	's	all	kinds	of	different	things	that	you	can	imagine	for	that	.
now	here	's	something	--	a	3d	printer	.
that	's	another	tool	that	's	really	taken	off	--	really	,	really	interesting	.
this	is	makerbot	.
and	there	are	industrial	versions	of	this	--	about	20,000	dollars	.
these	guys	came	up	with	a	kit	version	for	750	dollars	,	and	that	means	that	hobbyists	and	ordinary	folks	can	get	a	hold	of	this	and	begin	playing	with	3d	printers	.
now	they	do	n't	know	what	they	want	to	do	with	it	,	but	they	're	going	to	figure	it	out	.
they	will	only	figure	it	out	by	getting	their	hands	on	it	and	playing	with	it	.
one	of	the	coolest	things	is	,	makerbot	sent	out	an	upgrade	,	some	new	brackets	for	the	box	.
well	you	printed	out	the	brackets	and	then	replaced	the	old	brackets	with	the	new	ones	.
is	n't	that	cool	?
so	makers	harvest	technology	from	all	the	places	around	us	.
this	is	a	radar	speed	detector	that	was	developed	from	a	hot	wheels	toy	.
and	they	do	interesting	things	.
they	're	really	creating	new	areas	and	exploring	areas	that	you	might	only	think	--	the	military	is	doing	drones	--	well	,	there	is	a	whole	community	of	people	building	autonomous	airplanes	,	or	vehicles	--	something	that	you	could	program	to	fly	on	its	own	,	without	a	stick	or	anything	,	to	figure	out	what	path	it	's	going	.
fascinating	work	they	're	doing	.
we	just	had	an	issue	on	space	exploration	,	diy	space	exploration	.
this	is	probably	the	best	time	in	the	history	of	mankind	to	love	space	.
you	could	build	your	own	satellite	and	get	it	into	space	for	like	8,000	dollars	.
think	how	much	money	and	how	many	years	it	took	nasa	to	get	satellites	into	space	.
in	fact	,	these	guys	actually	work	for	nasa	,	and	they	're	trying	to	pioneer	using	off	-	the	-	shelf	components	,	cheap	things	that	are	n't	specialized	that	they	can	combine	and	send	up	into	space	.
makers	are	a	source	of	innovation	,	and	i	think	it	relates	back	to	something	like	the	birth	of	the	personal	computer	industry	.
this	is	steve	wozniak	.	where	does	he	learn	about	computers	?
it	's	the	homebrew	computer	club	--	just	like	a	hackerspace	.
and	he	says	,	``	i	could	go	there	all	day	long	and	talk	to	people	and	share	ideas	for	free	.	``
well	he	did	a	little	bit	better	than	free	.
but	it	's	important	to	understand	that	a	lot	of	the	origins	of	our	industries	--	even	like	henry	ford	--	come	from	this	idea	of	playing	and	figuring	things	out	in	groups	.
well	,	if	i	have	n't	convinced	you	that	you	're	a	maker	,	i	hope	i	could	convince	you	that	our	next	generation	should	be	makers	,	that	kids	are	particularly	interested	in	this	,	in	this	ability	to	control	the	physical	world	and	be	able	to	use	things	like	micro	-	controllers	and	build	robots	.
and	we	've	got	to	get	this	into	schools	,	or	into	communities	in	many	,	many	ways	--	the	ability	to	tinker	,	to	shape	and	reshape	the	world	around	us	.
there	's	a	great	opportunity	today	--	and	that	's	what	i	really	care	about	the	most	.
an	the	answer	to	the	question	:	what	will	america	make	?
it	's	more	makers	.
thank	you	very	much	.
