i	just	want	to	say	my	name	is	emmanuel	jal	.
and	i	come	from	a	long	way	.
i	've	been	telling	a	story	that	has	been	so	painful	for	me	.
it	's	been	a	tough	journey	for	me	,	traveling	the	world	,	telling	my	story	in	form	of	a	book	.
and	also	telling	it	like	now	.
and	also	,	the	easiest	one	was	when	i	was	doing	it	in	form	of	a	music	.
so	i	have	branded	myself	as	a	war	child	.
i	'm	doing	this	because	of	an	old	lady	in	my	village	now	,	who	have	lost	her	children	.
there	is	no	newspaper	to	cover	her	pain	,	and	what	she	wants	to	change	in	this	society	.
and	i	'm	doing	it	for	a	young	man	who	want	to	create	a	change	and	has	no	way	to	project	his	voice	because	he	ca	n't	write	.
or	there	is	no	internet	,	like	facebook	,	myspace	,	youtube	,	for	them	to	talk	.
also	one	thing	that	kept	me	pushing	this	story	,	this	painful	stories	out	,	the	dreams	i	have	,	sometimes	,	is	like	the	voices	of	the	dead	,	that	i	have	seen	would	tell	me	,	``	do	n't	give	up	.	keep	on	going	.	``
because	sometime	i	feel	like	stopping	and	not	doing	it	,	because	i	did	n't	know	what	i	was	putting	myself	into	.
well	i	was	born	in	the	most	difficult	time	,	when	my	country	was	at	war	.
i	saw	my	village	burned	down	.
the	world	that	meant	a	lot	to	me	,	i	saw	it	vanish	in	my	face	.
i	saw	my	aunt	in	rape	when	i	was	only	five	.
my	mother	was	claimed	by	the	war	.
my	brothers	and	sisters	were	scattered	.
and	up	to	now	,	me	and	my	father	were	detached	and	i	still	have	issues	with	him	.
seeing	people	die	every	day	,	my	mother	crying	,	it	's	like	i	was	raised	in	a	violence	.
and	that	made	me	call	myself	a	war	child	.
and	not	only	that	,	when	i	was	eight	i	became	a	child	soldier	.
i	did	n't	know	what	was	the	war	for	.
but	one	thing	i	knew	was	an	image	that	i	saw	that	stuck	in	my	head	.
when	i	went	to	the	training	camp	i	say	,	``	i	want	to	kill	as	many	muslims	,	and	as	many	arabs	,	as	possible	.	``
the	training	was	n't	easy	,	but	that	was	the	driving	force	,	because	i	wanted	to	revenge	for	my	family	.
i	wanted	to	revenge	for	my	village	.
luckily	now	things	have	changed	because	i	came	to	discover	the	truth	.
what	was	actually	killing	us	was	n't	the	muslims	,	was	n't	the	arabs	.
it	was	somebody	sitting	somewhere	manipulating	the	system	,	and	using	religion	to	get	what	they	want	to	get	out	of	us	,	which	is	the	oil	,	the	diamond	,	the	gold	and	the	land	.
so	realizing	the	truth	gave	me	a	position	to	choose	:	should	i	continue	to	hate	,	or	let	it	go	?
so	i	happened	to	forgive	.	now	i	sing	music	with	the	muslims	.	i	dance	with	them	.
i	even	had	a	movie	out	called	``	war	child	,	``	funded	by	muslim	people	.
so	that	pain	has	gone	out	.
but	my	story	is	huge	.
so	i	'm	just	going	to	go	into	a	different	step	now	,	which	is	easier	for	me	.
i	'm	going	to	give	you	poem	called	``	forced	to	sin	,	``	which	is	from	my	album	``	war	child	.	``
i	talk	about	my	story	.
one	of	the	journey	that	i	tread	when	i	was	tempted	to	eat	my	friend	because	we	had	no	food	and	we	were	like	around	400	.
and	only	16	people	survived	that	journey	.
so	i	hope	you	're	going	to	hear	this	.
my	dreams	are	like	torment	.
my	every	moment	.
voices	in	my	brain	,	of	friends	that	was	slain	.
friends	like	lual	who	died	by	my	side	,	of	starvation	.
in	the	burning	jungle	,	and	the	desert	plain	.
next	was	i	,	but	jesus	heard	my	cry	.
as	i	was	tempted	to	eat	the	rotten	flesh	of	my	comrade	,	he	gave	me	comfort	.
we	used	to	raid	villages	,	stealing	chickens	,	goats	and	sheeps	,	anything	we	could	eat	.
i	knew	it	was	rude	,	but	we	needed	food	.
and	therefore	i	was	forced	to	sin	,	forced	to	sin	to	make	a	living	,	forced	to	sin	to	make	a	living	.
sometimes	you	got	ta	lose	to	win	.
never	give	up	.	never	give	in	.
left	home	at	the	age	of	seven	.
one	year	later	,	live	with	an	ak	-	47	by	my	side	.
slept	with	one	eye	open	wide	.
run	,	duck	,	play	dead	and	hide	.
i	've	seen	my	people	die	like	flies	.
but	i	've	never	seen	a	dead	body	,	at	least	one	that	i	've	killed	.
but	still	as	i	wonder	,	i	wo	n't	go	under	.
guns	barking	like	lightning	and	thunder	.
as	a	child	so	young	and	tender	,	words	i	ca	n't	forget	i	still	remember	.
i	saw	sergeant	command	raising	his	hand	,	no	retreat	,	no	surrender	.
i	carry	the	banner	of	the	trauma	.
war	child	,	child	without	a	mama	,	still	fighting	in	the	saga	.
yet	as	i	wage	this	new	war	i	'm	not	alone	in	this	drama	.
no	sit	or	stop	,	as	i	reach	for	the	top	i	'm	fully	dedicated	like	a	patriotic	cop	.
i	'm	on	a	fight	,	day	and	night	.
sometime	i	do	wrong	in	order	to	make	things	right	.
it	's	like	i	'm	living	a	dream	.
first	time	i	'm	feeling	like	a	human	being	.
ah	!	the	children	of	darfur	.
your	empty	bellies	on	the	telly	and	now	it	's	you	that	i	'm	fighting	for	.
left	home	.
do	n't	even	know	the	day	i	'll	ever	return	.
my	country	is	war	-	torn	.
music	i	used	to	hear	was	bombs	and	fire	of	guns	.
so	many	people	die	that	i	do	n't	even	cry	no	more	.
ask	god	question	,	what	am	i	here	for	.
and	why	are	my	people	poor	.
and	why	,	why	when	the	rest	of	the	children	were	learning	how	to	read	and	write	,	i	was	learning	how	to	fight	.
i	ate	snails	,	vultures	,	rabbits	,	snakes	,	and	anything	that	had	life	.
i	was	ready	to	eat	.
i	know	it	's	a	shame	.	but	who	is	to	be	blamed	?
that	's	my	story	shared	in	the	form	of	a	lesson	.
thank	you	.
what	energized	me	and	kept	me	going	is	the	music	i	do	.
i	never	saw	anybody	to	tell	my	story	to	them	so	they	could	advise	me	or	do	therapy	.
so	the	music	had	been	my	therapy	for	me	.
it	's	been	where	i	actually	see	heaven	,	where	i	can	be	happy	,	where	i	can	be	a	child	again	,	in	dances	,	through	music	.
so	one	thing	i	know	about	music	:	music	is	the	only	thing	that	has	power	to	enter	your	cell	system	,	your	mind	,	your	heart	,	influence	your	soul	and	your	spirit	,	and	can	even	influence	the	way	you	live	without	even	you	knowing	.
music	is	the	only	thing	that	can	make	you	want	to	wake	up	your	bed	and	shake	your	leg	,	without	even	wanting	to	do	it	.
and	so	the	power	music	has	i	normally	compare	to	the	power	love	when	love	does	n't	see	a	color	.
you	know	,	if	you	fall	in	love	with	a	frog	,	that	's	it	.
one	testimony	about	how	i	find	music	is	powerful	is	when	i	was	still	a	soldier	back	then	.
i	hated	the	people	in	the	north	.
but	i	do	n't	know	why	i	do	n't	hate	their	music	.
so	we	party	and	dance	to	their	music	.
and	one	thing	that	shocked	me	is	one	day	they	brought	an	arab	musician	to	come	and	entertain	the	soldiers	.
and	i	almost	broke	my	leg	dancing	to	his	music	.
but	i	had	this	question	.
so	now	i	'm	doing	music	so	i	know	what	the	power	of	music	is	.
so	what	's	happening	here	?
i	've	been	in	a	painful	journey	.
today	is	day	number	233	in	which	i	only	eat	dinner	.
i	do	n't	eat	breakfast	.	no	lunch	.
and	i	've	done	a	campaign	called	lose	to	win	.
where	i	'm	losing	so	that	i	could	win	the	battle	that	i	'm	fighting	now	.
so	my	breakfast	,	my	lunch	,	i	donate	it	to	a	charity	that	i	founded	because	we	want	to	build	a	school	in	sudan	.
and	i	'm	doing	this	because	also	it	's	a	normal	thing	in	my	home	,	people	eat	one	meal	a	day	.
here	i	am	in	the	west	.	i	choose	not	to	.
so	in	my	village	now	,	kids	there	,	they	normally	listen	to	bbc	,	or	any	radio	,	and	they	are	waiting	to	know	,	the	day	emmanuel	will	eat	his	breakfast	it	means	he	got	the	money	to	build	our	school	.
and	so	i	made	a	commitment	.	i	say	,	``	i	'm	gon	na	not	eat	my	breakfast	.	``
i	thought	i	was	famous	enough	that	i	would	raise	the	money	within	one	month	,	but	i	've	been	humbled	.
so	it	's	taken	me	232	days	.
and	i	said	,	``	no	stop	until	we	get	it	.	``
and	like	it	's	been	done	on	facebook	,	myspace	.
the	people	are	giving	three	dollars	.
the	lowest	amount	we	ever	got	was	20	cents	.
somebody	donated	20	cents	online	.
i	do	n't	know	how	they	did	it	.
but	that	moved	me	.
and	so	,	the	importance	of	education	to	me	is	what	i	'm	willing	to	die	for	.
i	'm	willing	to	die	for	this	,	because	i	know	what	it	can	do	to	my	people	.
education	enlighten	your	brain	,	give	you	so	many	chances	,	and	you	're	able	to	survive	.
as	a	nation	we	have	been	crippled	.
for	so	many	years	we	have	fed	on	aid	.
you	see	a	20	-	years	-	old	,	30	-	years	-	old	families	in	a	refugee	camps	.
they	only	get	the	food	that	drops	from	the	sky	,	from	the	u.n	.
so	these	people	,	you	're	killing	a	whole	generation	if	you	just	give	them	aid	.
if	anybody	want	to	help	us	this	is	what	we	need	.
give	us	tools	.	give	the	farmers	tools	.
it	's	rain	.	africa	is	fertile	.	they	can	grow	the	crops	.
invest	in	education	.
education	so	that	we	have	strong	institution	that	can	create	a	revolution	to	change	everything	.
because	we	have	all	those	old	men	that	are	creating	wars	in	africa	.	they	will	die	soon	.
but	if	you	invest	in	education	then	we	'll	be	able	to	change	africa	.
that	's	what	i	'm	asking	.
so	in	order	to	do	that	,	i	founded	a	charter	called	gua	africa	,	where	we	put	kids	in	school	.
and	now	we	have	a	couple	in	university	.
we	have	like	40	kids	,	ex	-	child	soldiers	mixed	with	anybody	that	we	feel	like	we	want	to	support	.
and	i	said	``	i	'm	going	to	put	it	in	practice	.	``
and	with	the	people	that	are	going	to	follow	me	and	help	me	do	things	.
that	's	what	i	want	to	do	to	change	,	to	make	a	difference	in	the	world	.
well	now	,	my	time	is	going	,	so	i	want	to	sing	a	song	.
but	i	'll	ask	you	guys	to	stand	up	so	we	celebrate	the	life	of	a	british	aid	worker	called	emma	mccune	that	made	it	possible	for	me	to	be	here	.
i	'm	gon	na	sing	this	song	,	just	to	inspire	you	how	this	woman	has	made	a	difference	.
she	came	to	my	country	and	saw	the	importance	of	education	.
she	said	the	only	way	to	help	sudan	is	to	invest	in	the	women	,	educating	them	,	educating	the	children	,	so	that	they	could	come	and	create	a	revolution	in	this	complex	society	.
so	she	even	ended	up	marrying	a	commander	from	the	spla	.
and	she	rescued	over	150	child	soldiers	.
one	of	them	happened	to	be	me	now	.
and	so	at	this	moment	i	want	to	ask	to	celebrate	emma	with	me	.
are	you	guys	ready	to	celebrate	emma	?
audience	:	yes	!
