many	times	i	go	around	the	world	to	speak	,	and	people	ask	me	questions	about	the	challenges	,	my	moments	,	some	of	my	regrets	.
1998	:	a	single	mother	of	four	,	three	months	after	the	birth	of	my	fourth	child	,	i	went	to	do	a	job	as	a	research	assistant	.
i	went	to	northern	liberia	.
and	as	part	of	the	work	,	the	village	would	give	you	lodgings	.
and	they	gave	me	lodging	with	a	single	mother	and	her	daughter	.
this	girl	happened	to	be	the	only	girl	in	the	entire	village	who	had	made	it	to	the	ninth	grade	.
she	was	the	laughing	stock	of	the	community	.
her	mother	was	often	told	by	other	women	,	``	you	and	your	child	will	die	poor	.	``
after	two	weeks	of	working	in	that	village	,	it	was	time	to	go	back	.
the	mother	came	to	me	,	knelt	down	,	and	said	,	``	leymah	,	take	my	daughter	.
i	wish	for	her	to	be	a	nurse	.	``
dirt	poor	,	living	in	the	home	with	my	parents	,	i	could	n't	afford	to	.
with	tears	in	my	eyes	,	i	said	,	``	no.	``
two	months	later	,	i	go	to	another	village	on	the	same	assignment	and	they	asked	me	to	live	with	the	village	chief	.
the	women	's	chief	of	the	village	has	this	little	girl	,	fair	color	like	me	,	totally	dirty	.
and	all	day	she	walked	around	only	in	her	underwear	.
when	i	asked	,	``	who	is	that	?	``
she	said	,	``	that	's	wei	.
the	meaning	of	her	name	is	pig	.
her	mother	died	while	giving	birth	to	her	,	and	no	one	had	any	idea	who	her	father	was	.	``
for	two	weeks	,	she	became	my	companion	,	slept	with	me	.
i	bought	her	used	clothes	and	bought	her	her	first	doll	.
the	night	before	i	left	,	she	came	to	the	room	and	said	,	``	leymah	,	do	n't	leave	me	here	.
i	wish	to	go	with	you	.
i	wish	to	go	to	school	.	``
dirt	poor	,	no	money	,	living	with	my	parents	,	i	again	said	,	``	no.	``
two	months	later	,	both	of	those	villages	fell	into	another	war	.
till	today	,	i	have	no	idea	where	those	two	girls	are	.
fast	-	forward	,	2004	:	in	the	peak	of	our	activism	,	the	minister	of	gender	liberia	called	me	and	said	,	``	leymah	,	i	have	a	nine	-	year	-	old	for	you	.
i	want	you	to	bring	her	home	because	we	do	n't	have	safe	homes	.	``
the	story	of	this	little	girl	:	she	had	been	raped	by	her	paternal	grandfather	every	day	for	six	months	.
she	came	to	me	bloated	,	very	pale	.
every	night	i	'd	come	from	work	and	lie	on	the	cold	floor	.
she	'd	lie	beside	me	and	say	,	``	auntie	,	i	wish	to	be	well	.
i	wish	to	go	to	school	.	``
2010	:	a	young	woman	stands	before	president	sirleaf	and	gives	her	testimony	of	how	she	and	her	siblings	live	together	,	their	father	and	mother	died	during	the	war	.
she	's	19	;	her	dream	is	to	go	to	college	to	be	able	to	support	them	.
she	's	highly	athletic	.
one	of	the	things	that	happens	is	that	she	applies	for	a	scholarship	.
full	scholarship	.	she	gets	it	.
her	dream	of	going	to	school	,	her	wish	of	being	educated	,	is	finally	here	.
she	goes	to	school	on	the	first	day	.
the	director	of	sports	who	's	responsible	for	getting	her	into	the	program	asks	her	to	come	out	of	class	.
and	for	the	next	three	years	,	her	fate	will	be	having	sex	with	him	every	day	,	as	a	favor	for	getting	her	in	school	.
globally	,	we	have	policies	,	international	instruments	,	work	leaders	.
great	people	have	made	commitments	--	we	will	protect	our	children	from	want	and	from	fear	.
the	u.n.	has	the	convention	on	the	rights	of	the	child	.
countries	like	america	,	we	've	heard	things	like	no	child	left	behind	.
other	countries	come	with	different	things	.
there	is	a	millennium	development	called	three	that	focuses	on	girls	.
all	of	these	great	works	by	great	people	aimed	at	getting	young	people	to	where	we	want	to	get	them	globally	,	i	think	,	has	failed	.
in	liberia	,	for	example	,	the	teenage	pregnancy	rate	is	three	to	every	10	girls	.
teen	prostitution	is	at	its	peak	.
in	one	community	,	we	're	told	,	you	wake	up	in	the	morning	and	see	used	condoms	like	used	chewing	gum	paper	.
girls	as	young	as	12	being	prostituted	for	less	than	a	dollar	a	night	.
it	's	disheartening	,	it	's	sad	.
and	then	someone	asked	me	,	just	before	my	tedtalk	,	a	few	days	ago	,	``	so	where	is	the	hope	?	``
several	years	ago	,	a	few	friends	of	mine	decided	we	needed	to	bridge	the	disconnect	between	our	generation	and	the	generation	of	young	women	.
it	's	not	enough	to	say	you	have	two	nobel	laureates	from	the	republic	of	liberia	when	your	girls	'	kids	are	totally	out	there	and	no	hope	,	or	seemingly	no	hope	.
we	created	a	space	called	the	young	girls	transformative	project	.
we	go	into	rural	communities	and	all	we	do	,	like	has	been	done	in	this	room	,	is	create	the	space	.
when	these	girls	sit	,	you	unlock	intelligence	,	you	unlock	passion	,	you	unlock	commitment	,	you	unlock	focus	,	you	unlock	great	leaders	.
today	,	we	've	worked	with	over	300	.
and	some	of	those	girls	who	walked	in	the	room	very	shy	have	taken	bold	steps	,	as	young	mothers	,	to	go	out	there	and	advocate	for	the	rights	of	other	young	women	.
one	young	woman	i	met	,	teen	mother	of	four	,	never	thought	about	finishing	high	school	,	graduated	successfully	;	never	thought	about	going	to	college	,	enrolled	in	college	.
one	day	she	said	to	me	,	``	my	wish	is	to	finish	college	and	be	able	to	support	my	children	.	``
she	's	at	a	place	where	she	ca	n't	find	money	to	go	to	school	.
she	sells	water	,	sells	soft	drinks	and	sells	recharge	cards	for	cellphones	.
and	you	would	think	she	would	take	that	money	and	put	it	back	into	her	education	.
juanita	is	her	name	.
she	takes	that	money	and	finds	single	mothers	in	her	community	to	send	back	to	school	.
says	,	``	leymah	,	my	wish	is	to	be	educated	.
and	if	i	ca	n't	be	educated	,	when	i	see	some	of	my	sisters	being	educated	,	my	wish	has	been	fulfilled	.
i	wish	for	a	better	life	.
i	wish	for	food	for	my	children	.
i	wish	that	sexual	abuse	and	exploitation	in	schools	would	stop	.	``
this	is	the	dream	of	the	african	girl	.
several	years	ago	,	there	was	one	african	girl	.
this	girl	had	a	son	who	wished	for	a	piece	of	doughnut	because	he	was	extremely	hungry	.
angry	,	frustrated	,	really	upset	about	the	state	of	her	society	and	the	state	of	her	children	,	this	young	girl	started	a	movement	,	a	movement	of	ordinary	women	banding	together	to	build	peace	.
i	will	fulfill	the	wish	.
this	is	another	african	girl	's	wish	.
i	failed	to	fulfill	the	wish	of	those	two	girls	.
i	failed	to	do	this	.
these	were	the	things	that	were	going	through	the	head	of	this	other	young	woman	--	i	failed	,	i	failed	,	i	failed	.
so	i	will	do	this	.
women	came	out	,	protested	a	brutal	dictator	,	fearlessly	spoke	.
not	only	did	the	wish	of	a	piece	of	doughnut	come	true	,	the	wish	of	peace	came	true	.
this	young	woman	wished	also	to	go	to	school	.
she	went	to	school	.
this	young	woman	wished	for	other	things	to	happen	,	it	happened	for	her	.
today	,	this	young	woman	is	me	,	a	nobel	laureate	.
i	'm	now	on	a	journey	to	fulfill	the	wish	,	in	my	tiny	capacity	,	of	little	african	girls	--	the	wish	of	being	educated	.
we	set	up	a	foundation	.
we	're	giving	full	four	-	year	scholarships	to	girls	from	villages	that	we	see	with	potential	.
i	do	n't	have	much	to	ask	of	you	.
i	've	also	been	to	places	in	this	u.s.	,	and	i	know	that	girls	in	this	country	also	have	wishes	,	a	wish	for	a	better	life	somewhere	in	the	bronx	,	a	wish	for	a	better	life	somewhere	in	downtown	l.a.	,	a	wish	for	a	better	life	somewhere	in	texas	,	a	wish	for	a	better	life	somewhere	in	new	york	,	a	wish	for	a	better	life	somewhere	in	new	jersey	.
will	you	journey	with	me	to	help	that	girl	,	be	it	an	african	girl	or	an	american	girl	or	a	japanese	girl	,	fulfill	her	wish	,	fulfill	her	dream	,	achieve	that	dream	?
because	all	of	these	great	innovators	and	inventors	that	we	've	talked	to	and	seen	over	the	last	few	days	are	also	sitting	in	tiny	corners	in	different	parts	of	the	world	,	and	all	they	're	asking	us	to	do	is	create	that	space	to	unlock	the	intelligence	,	unlock	the	passion	,	unlock	all	of	the	great	things	that	they	hold	within	themselves	.
let	's	journey	together	.	let	's	journey	together	.
thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	thank	you	so	much	.
right	now	in	liberia	,	what	do	you	see	as	the	main	issue	that	troubles	you	?
lg	:	i	've	been	asked	to	lead	the	liberian	reconciliation	initiative	.
as	part	of	my	work	,	i	'm	doing	these	tours	in	different	villages	and	towns	--	13	,	15	hours	on	dirt	roads	--	and	there	is	no	community	that	i	've	gone	into	that	i	have	n't	seen	intelligent	girls	.
but	sadly	,	the	vision	of	a	great	future	,	or	the	dream	of	a	great	future	,	is	just	a	dream	,	because	you	have	all	of	these	vices	.
teen	pregnancy	,	like	i	said	,	is	epidemic	.
so	what	troubles	me	is	that	i	was	at	that	place	and	somehow	i	'm	at	this	place	,	and	i	just	do	n't	want	to	be	the	only	one	at	this	place	.
i	'm	looking	for	ways	for	other	girls	to	be	with	me	.
i	want	to	look	back	20	years	from	now	and	see	that	there	's	another	liberian	girl	,	ghanaian	girl	,	nigerian	girl	,	ethiopian	girl	standing	on	this	ted	stage	.
and	maybe	,	just	maybe	,	saying	,	``	because	of	that	nobel	laureate	i	'm	here	today	.	``
so	i	'm	troubled	when	i	see	them	like	there	's	no	hope	.
but	i	'm	also	not	pessimistic	,	because	i	know	it	does	n't	take	a	lot	to	get	them	charged	up	.
ca	:	and	in	the	last	year	,	tell	us	one	hopeful	thing	that	you	've	seen	happening	.
lg	:	i	can	tell	you	many	hopeful	things	that	i	've	seen	happening	.
but	in	the	last	year	,	where	president	sirleaf	comes	from	,	her	village	,	we	went	there	to	work	with	these	girls	.
and	we	could	not	find	25	girls	in	high	school	.
all	of	these	girls	went	to	the	gold	mine	,	and	they	were	predominantly	prostitutes	doing	other	things	.
we	took	50	of	those	girls	and	we	worked	with	them	.
and	this	was	at	the	beginning	of	elections	.
this	is	one	place	where	women	were	never	--	even	the	older	ones	barely	sat	in	the	circle	with	the	men	.
these	girls	banded	together	and	formed	a	group	and	launched	a	campaign	for	voter	registration	.
this	is	a	real	rural	village	.
and	the	theme	they	used	was	:	``	even	pretty	girls	vote	.	``
they	were	able	to	mobilize	young	women	.
but	not	only	did	they	do	that	,	they	went	to	those	who	were	running	for	seats	to	ask	them	,	``	what	is	it	that	you	will	give	the	girls	of	this	community	when	you	win	?	``
and	one	of	the	guys	who	already	had	a	seat	was	very	--	because	liberia	has	one	of	the	strongest	rape	laws	,	and	he	was	one	of	those	really	fighting	in	parliament	to	overturn	that	law	because	he	called	it	barbaric	.
rape	is	not	barbaric	,	but	the	law	,	he	said	,	was	barbaric	.
and	when	the	girls	started	engaging	him	,	he	was	very	hostile	towards	them	.
these	little	girls	turned	to	him	and	said	,	``	we	will	vote	you	out	of	office	.	``
he	's	out	of	office	today	.
ca	:	leymah	,	thank	you	.	thank	you	so	much	for	coming	to	ted	.
lg	:	you	're	welcome	.
