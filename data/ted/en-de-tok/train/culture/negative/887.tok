i	would	be	willing	to	bet	that	i	'm	the	dumbest	guy	in	the	room	because	i	could	n't	get	through	school	.	i	struggled	with	school	.
but	what	i	knew	at	a	very	early	age	was	that	i	loved	money	and	i	loved	business	and	i	loved	this	entrepreneurial	thing	,	and	i	was	raised	to	be	an	entrepreneur	,	and	what	i	've	been	really	passionate	about	ever	since	--	and	i	've	never	spoken	about	this	ever	,	until	now	--	so	this	is	the	first	time	anyone	's	ever	heard	it	,	except	my	wife	three	days	ago	,	because	she	said	,	``	what	are	you	talking	about	?	``	and	i	told	her	--	is	that	i	think	we	miss	an	opportunity	to	find	these	kids	who	have	the	entrepreneurial	traits	,	and	to	groom	them	or	show	them	that	being	an	entrepreneur	is	actually	a	cool	thing	.
it	's	not	something	that	is	a	bad	thing	and	is	vilified	,	which	is	what	happens	in	a	lot	of	society	.
kids	,	when	we	grow	up	,	have	dreams	,	and	we	have	passions	,	and	we	have	visions	,	and	somehow	we	get	those	things	crushed	.
we	get	told	that	we	need	to	study	harder	or	be	more	focused	or	get	a	tutor	.
my	parents	got	me	a	tutor	in	french	,	and	i	still	suck	in	french	.
two	years	ago	,	i	was	the	highest	-	rated	lecturer	at	mit	's	entrepreneurial	master	's	program	.
and	it	was	a	speaking	event	in	front	of	groups	of	entrepreneurs	from	around	the	world	.
when	i	was	in	grade	two	,	i	won	a	city	-	wide	speaking	competition	,	but	nobody	had	ever	said	,	``	hey	,	this	kid	's	a	good	speaker	.
he	ca	n't	focus	,	but	he	loves	walking	around	and	getting	people	energized	.	``
no	one	said	,	``	get	him	a	coach	in	speaking	.	``
they	said	,	get	me	a	tutor	in	what	i	suck	at	.
so	as	kids	show	these	traits	--	and	we	need	to	start	looking	for	them	--	i	think	we	should	be	raising	kids	to	be	entrepreneurs	instead	of	lawyers	.
unfortunately	the	school	system	is	grooming	this	world	to	say	,	``	hey	,	let	's	be	a	lawyer	or	let	's	be	a	doctor	,	``	and	we	're	missing	that	opportunity	because	no	one	ever	says	,	``	hey	,	be	an	entrepreneur	.	``
entrepreneurs	are	people	--	because	we	have	a	lot	of	them	in	this	room	--	who	have	these	ideas	and	these	passions	or	see	these	needs	in	the	world	and	we	decide	to	stand	up	and	do	it	.
and	we	put	everything	on	the	line	to	make	that	stuff	happen	.
we	have	the	ability	to	get	those	groups	of	people	around	us	that	want	to	kind	of	build	that	dream	with	us	,	and	i	think	if	we	could	get	kids	to	embrace	the	idea	at	a	young	age	of	being	entrepreneurial	,	we	could	change	everything	in	the	world	that	is	a	problem	today	.
every	problem	that	's	out	there	,	somebody	has	the	idea	for	.
and	as	a	young	kid	,	nobody	can	say	it	ca	n't	happen	because	you	're	too	dumb	to	realize	that	you	could	n't	figure	it	out	.
i	think	we	have	an	obligation	as	parents	and	a	society	to	start	teaching	our	kids	to	fish	instead	of	giving	them	the	fish	--	the	old	parable	:	``	if	you	give	a	man	a	fish	,	you	feed	him	for	a	day	.
if	you	teach	a	man	to	fish	,	you	feed	him	for	a	lifetime	.	``
if	we	can	teach	our	kids	to	become	entrepreneurial	--	the	ones	that	show	those	traits	to	be	--	like	we	teach	the	ones	who	have	science	gifts	to	go	on	in	science	,	what	if	we	saw	the	ones	who	had	entrepreneurial	traits	and	taught	them	to	be	entrepreneurs	?
we	could	actually	have	all	these	kids	spreading	businesses	instead	of	waiting	for	government	handouts	.
what	we	do	is	we	sit	and	teach	our	kids	all	the	things	they	should	n't	do	:	do	n't	hit	;	do	n't	bite	;	do	n't	swear	.
right	now	we	teach	our	kids	to	go	after	really	good	jobs	,	you	know	,	and	the	school	system	teaches	them	to	go	after	things	like	being	a	doctor	and	being	a	lawyer	and	being	an	accountant	and	a	dentist	and	a	teacher	and	a	pilot	.
and	the	media	says	that	it	's	really	cool	if	we	could	go	out	and	be	a	model	or	a	singer	or	a	sports	hero	like	luongo	,	crosby	.
our	mba	programs	do	not	teach	kids	to	be	entrepreneurs	.
the	reason	that	i	avoided	an	mba	program	--	other	than	the	fact	that	i	could	n't	get	into	any	because	i	had	a	61	percent	average	out	of	high	school	and	then	61	percent	average	at	the	only	school	in	canada	that	accepted	me	,	carlton	--	but	our	mba	programs	do	n't	teach	kids	to	be	entrepreneurs	.
they	teach	them	to	go	work	in	corporations	.
so	who	's	starting	these	companies	?	it	's	these	random	few	people	.
even	in	popular	literature	,	the	only	book	i	've	ever	found	--	and	this	should	be	on	all	of	your	reading	lists	--	the	only	book	i	've	ever	found	that	makes	the	entrepreneur	into	the	hero	is	``	atlas	shrugged	.	``
everything	else	in	the	world	tends	to	look	at	entrepreneurs	and	say	that	we	're	bad	people	.
i	look	at	even	my	family	.
both	my	grandfathers	were	entrepreneurs	.	my	dad	was	an	entrepreneur	.
both	my	brother	and	sister	and	i	,	all	three	of	us	own	companies	as	well	.
and	we	all	decided	to	start	these	things	because	it	's	really	the	only	place	we	fit	.
we	did	n't	fit	in	the	normal	work	.	we	could	n't	work	for	somebody	else	because	we	're	too	stubborn	and	we	have	all	these	other	traits	.
but	kids	could	be	entrepreneurs	as	well	.
i	'm	a	big	part	of	a	couple	organizations	globally	called	the	entrepreneurs	'	organization	and	the	young	presidents	'	organization	.
i	just	came	back	from	speaking	in	barcelona	at	the	ypo	global	conference	,	and	everyone	that	i	met	over	there	who	's	an	entrepreneur	struggled	with	school	.
i	have	18	out	of	the	19	signs	of	attention	deficit	disorder	diagnosed	.
so	this	thing	right	here	is	freaking	me	out	.
it	's	probably	why	i	'm	a	little	bit	panicked	right	now	--	other	than	all	the	caffeine	that	i	've	had	and	the	sugar	--	but	this	is	really	creepy	for	an	entrepreneur	.
attention	deficit	disorder	,	bipolar	disorder	.
do	you	know	that	bipolar	disorder	is	nicknamed	the	ceo	disease	?
ted	turner	's	got	it	.	steve	jobs	has	it	.
all	three	of	the	founders	of	netscape	had	it	.
i	could	go	on	and	on	.
kids	--	you	can	see	these	signs	in	kids	.
and	what	we	're	doing	is	we	're	giving	them	ritalin	and	saying	,	``	do	n't	be	an	entrepreneurial	type	.
fit	into	this	other	system	and	try	to	become	a	student	.	``
sorry	,	entrepreneurs	are	n't	students	.
we	fast	-	track	.	we	figure	out	the	game	.
i	stole	essays	.	i	cheated	on	exams	.
i	hired	kids	to	do	my	accounting	assignments	in	university	for	13	consecutive	assignments	.
but	as	an	entrepreneur	you	do	n't	do	accounting	,	you	hire	accountants	.
so	i	just	figured	that	out	earlier	.
at	least	i	can	admit	i	cheated	in	university	;	most	of	you	wo	n't	.
i	'm	also	quoted	--	and	i	told	the	person	who	wrote	the	textbook	--	i	'm	now	quoted	in	that	exact	same	university	textbook	in	every	canadian	university	and	college	studies	.
in	managerial	accounting	,	i	'm	chapter	eight	.
i	open	up	chapter	eight	talking	about	budgeting	.
and	i	told	the	author	,	after	they	did	my	interview	,	that	i	cheated	in	that	same	course	.
and	she	thought	it	was	too	funny	to	not	include	it	anyway	.
but	kids	,	you	can	see	these	signs	in	them	.
the	definition	of	an	entrepreneur	is	``	a	person	who	organizes	,	operates	and	assumes	the	risk	of	a	business	venture	.	``
that	does	n't	mean	you	have	to	go	to	an	mba	program	.
it	does	n't	mean	you	have	to	get	through	school	.
it	just	means	that	those	few	things	have	to	feel	right	in	your	gut	.
and	we	've	heard	those	things	about	``	is	it	nurture	or	is	it	nature	,	``	right	?
is	it	thing	one	or	thing	two	?	what	is	it	?
well	,	i	do	n't	think	it	's	either	.	i	think	it	can	be	both	.
i	was	groomed	as	an	entrepreneur	.
when	i	was	growing	up	as	a	young	kid	,	i	had	no	choice	,	because	i	was	taught	at	a	very	early	,	young	age	--	when	my	dad	realized	i	was	n't	going	to	fit	into	everything	else	that	was	being	taught	to	me	in	school	--	that	he	could	teach	me	to	figure	out	business	at	an	early	age	.
he	groomed	us	,	the	three	of	us	,	to	hate	the	thought	of	having	a	job	and	to	love	the	fact	of	creating	companies	that	we	could	employ	other	people	.
my	first	little	business	venture	:	i	was	seven	years	old	,	i	was	in	winnipeg	,	and	i	was	lying	in	my	bedroom	with	one	of	those	long	extension	cords	.
and	i	was	calling	all	the	dry	cleaners	in	winnipeg	to	find	out	how	much	would	the	dry	cleaners	pay	me	for	coat	hangers	.
and	my	mom	came	into	the	room	and	she	said	,	``	where	are	you	going	to	get	the	coat	hangers	to	sell	to	the	dry	cleaners	?	``
and	i	said	,	``	let	's	go	and	look	in	the	basement	.	``
and	we	went	down	to	the	basement	.	and	i	opened	up	this	cupboard	.
and	there	was	about	a	thousand	coat	hangers	that	i	'd	collected	.
because	,	when	i	told	her	i	was	going	out	to	play	with	the	kids	,	i	was	going	door	to	door	in	the	neighborhood	to	collect	coat	hangers	to	put	in	the	basement	to	sell	.
because	i	saw	her	a	few	weeks	before	that	--	you	could	get	paid	.	they	used	to	pay	you	two	cents	per	coat	hanger	.
so	i	was	just	like	,	well	there	's	all	kinds	of	coat	hangers	.
and	so	i	'll	just	go	get	them	.
and	i	knew	she	would	n't	want	me	to	go	get	them	,	so	i	just	did	it	anyway	.
and	i	learned	that	you	could	actually	negotiate	with	people	.
this	one	person	offered	me	three	cents	and	i	got	him	up	to	three	and	a	half	.
i	even	knew	at	a	seven	-	year	-	old	age	that	i	could	actually	get	a	fractional	percent	of	a	cent	,	and	people	would	pay	that	because	it	multiplied	up	.
at	seven	years	old	i	figured	it	out	.	i	got	three	and	a	half	cents	for	a	thousand	coat	hangers	.
i	sold	license	plate	protectors	door	to	door	.
my	dad	actually	made	me	go	find	someone	who	would	sell	me	these	things	at	wholesale	.
and	at	nine	years	old	,	i	walked	around	in	the	city	of	sudbury	selling	license	plate	protectors	door	to	door	to	houses	.
and	i	remember	this	one	customer	so	vividly	because	i	also	did	some	other	stuff	with	these	clients	.
i	sold	newspapers	.
and	he	would	n't	buy	a	newspaper	from	me	ever	.
but	i	was	convinced	i	was	going	to	get	him	to	buy	a	license	plate	protector	.
and	he	's	like	,	``	well	,	we	do	n't	need	one	.	``
and	i	said	,	``	but	you	've	got	two	cars	.	.	.	``	--	i	'm	nine	years	old	.
i	'm	like	,	``	but	you	have	two	cars	and	they	do	n't	have	license	plate	protectors	.	``
and	he	said	,	``	i	know	.	``
and	i	said	,	``	this	car	here	's	got	one	license	plate	that	's	all	crumpled	up	.	``
and	he	said	,	``	yes	,	that	's	my	wife	's	car	.	``	and	i	said	,	``	why	do	n't	we	just	test	one	on	the	front	of	your	wife	's	car	and	see	if	it	lasts	longer	.	``
so	i	knew	there	were	two	cars	with	two	license	plates	on	each	.
if	i	could	n't	sell	all	four	,	i	could	at	least	get	one	.
i	learned	that	at	a	young	age	.
i	did	comic	book	arbitrage	.
when	i	was	about	10	years	old	,	i	sold	comic	books	out	of	our	cottage	on	georgian	bay	.
and	i	would	go	biking	up	to	the	end	of	the	beach	and	buy	all	the	comics	from	the	poor	kids	.
and	then	i	would	go	back	to	the	other	end	of	the	beach	and	sell	them	to	the	rich	kids	.
but	it	was	obvious	to	me	,	right	?	buy	low	,	sell	high	.
you	've	got	this	demand	over	here	that	has	money	.
do	n't	try	to	sell	to	the	poor	kids	;	they	do	n't	have	cash	.	the	rich	people	do	.	go	get	some	.
so	that	's	obvious	,	right	.
it	's	like	a	recession	.	so	,	there	's	a	recession	.
there	's	still	13	trillion	dollars	circulating	in	the	u.s.	economy	.
go	get	some	of	that	.	and	i	learned	that	at	a	young	age	.
i	also	learned	,	do	n't	reveal	your	source	,	because	i	got	beat	up	after	about	four	weeks	of	doing	this	because	one	of	the	rich	kids	found	out	where	i	was	buying	my	comics	from	,	and	he	did	n't	like	the	fact	that	he	was	paying	a	lot	more	.
i	was	forced	to	get	a	paper	route	at	10	years	old	.
i	did	n't	really	want	a	paper	route	,	but	at	10	,	my	dad	said	,	``	that	's	going	to	be	your	next	business	.	``
so	not	only	would	he	get	me	one	,	but	i	had	to	get	two	,	and	then	he	wanted	me	to	hire	someone	to	deliver	half	the	papers	,	which	i	did	,	and	then	i	realized	that	collecting	tips	was	where	you	made	all	the	money	.
so	i	would	collect	the	tips	and	get	payment	.
so	i	would	go	and	collect	for	all	the	papers	.
he	could	just	deliver	them	.
because	then	i	realized	i	could	make	the	money	.
by	this	point	,	i	was	definitely	not	going	to	be	an	employee	.
my	dad	owned	an	automotive	and	industrial	repair	shop	.
he	had	all	these	old	automotive	parts	lying	around	.
they	had	this	old	brass	and	copper	.
i	asked	him	what	he	did	with	it	,	and	he	said	he	just	throws	it	out	.
i	said	,	``	but	would	n't	somebody	pay	you	for	that	?	``	and	he	goes	,	``	maybe	.	``
remember	at	10	years	old	--	so	34	years	ago	i	saw	opportunity	in	this	stuff	.
i	saw	there	was	money	in	garbage	.
and	i	was	actually	collecting	it	from	all	the	automotive	shops	in	the	area	on	my	bicycle	.
and	then	my	dad	would	drive	me	on	saturdays	to	a	scrap	metal	recycler	where	i	got	paid	.
and	i	thought	that	was	kind	of	cool	.
strangely	enough	,	30	years	later	,	we	're	building	1-800	-	got	-	junk	?
and	making	money	off	that	too	.
i	built	these	little	pincushions	when	i	was	11	years	old	in	cubs	,	and	we	made	these	pin	cushions	for	our	moms	for	mother	's	day	.
and	you	made	these	pincushions	out	of	wooden	clothespins	--	when	we	used	to	hang	clothes	on	clotheslines	outside	.
and	you	'd	make	these	chairs	.
and	i	had	these	little	pillows	that	i	would	sew	up	.
and	you	could	stuff	pins	in	them	.
because	people	used	to	sew	and	they	needed	a	pin	cushion	.
but	what	i	realized	was	that	you	had	to	have	options	.
so	i	actually	spray	painted	a	whole	bunch	of	them	brown	.
and	then	when	i	went	to	the	door	,	it	was	n't	,	``	do	you	want	to	buy	one	?	``
it	was	,	``	which	color	would	you	like	?	``
like	i	'm	10	years	old	;	you	're	not	going	to	say	no	to	me	,	especially	if	you	have	two	options	--	you	have	the	brown	one	or	the	clear	one	.
so	i	learned	that	lesson	at	a	young	age	.
i	learned	that	manual	labor	really	sucks	.
right	,	like	cutting	lawns	is	brutal	.
but	because	i	had	to	cut	lawns	all	summer	for	all	of	our	neighbors	and	get	paid	to	do	that	,	i	realized	that	recurring	revenue	from	one	client	is	amazing	.
that	if	i	land	this	client	once	,	and	every	week	i	get	paid	by	that	person	,	that	's	way	better	than	trying	to	sell	one	clothespin	thing	to	one	person	.
because	you	ca	n't	sell	them	more	.
so	i	love	that	recurring	revenue	model	i	started	to	learn	at	a	young	age	.
remember	,	i	was	being	groomed	to	do	this	.	i	was	not	allowed	to	have	jobs	.
i	would	caddy	,	i	would	go	to	the	golf	course	and	caddy	for	people	.
but	i	realized	that	there	was	this	one	hill	on	our	golf	course	,	the	13th	hole	that	had	this	huge	hill	.
and	people	could	never	get	their	bags	up	it	.
so	i	would	sit	there	with	a	lawn	chair	and	just	carry	up	all	the	people	who	did	n't	have	caddies	.
i	would	carry	their	golf	bags	up	to	the	top	,	and	they	'd	pay	me	a	dollar	.
meanwhile	,	my	friends	were	working	for	five	hours	to	haul	some	guy	's	bag	around	and	get	paid	10	bucks	.
i	'm	like	,	``	that	's	stupid	because	you	have	to	work	for	five	hours	.
that	does	n't	make	any	sense	.	``	you	just	figure	out	a	way	to	make	more	money	faster	.
every	week	,	i	would	go	to	the	corner	store	and	buy	all	these	pops	.
then	i	would	go	up	and	deliver	them	to	these	70	-	year	-	old	women	playing	bridge	.
and	they	'd	give	me	their	orders	for	the	following	week	.
and	then	i	'd	just	deliver	pop	and	i	'd	just	charge	twice	.
and	i	had	this	captured	market	.	you	did	n't	need	contracts	.
you	just	needed	to	have	a	supply	and	demand	and	this	audience	who	bought	into	you	.
these	women	were	n't	going	to	go	to	anybody	else	because	they	liked	me	,	and	i	kind	of	figured	it	out	.
i	went	and	got	golf	balls	from	golf	courses	.
but	everybody	else	was	looking	in	the	bush	and	looking	in	the	ditches	for	golf	balls	.
i	'm	like	,	screw	that	.	they	're	all	in	the	pond	and	nobody	's	going	into	the	pond	.
so	i	would	go	into	the	ponds	and	crawl	around	and	pick	them	up	with	my	toes	.
you	just	pick	them	up	with	both	feet	.
you	ca	n't	do	it	on	stage	.
you	get	the	golf	balls	,	and	you	just	throw	them	in	your	bathing	suit	trunks	and	when	you	're	done	you	've	got	a	couple	hundred	of	them	.
but	the	problem	is	that	people	all	did	n't	want	all	the	golf	balls	.
so	i	just	packaged	them	.	i	'm	like	12	,	right	?
i	packaged	them	up	three	ways	.
i	had	the	pinnacles	and	ddhs	and	the	really	cool	ones	back	then	.
those	sold	for	two	dollars	each	.
and	then	i	had	all	the	good	ones	that	did	n't	look	crappy	.	they	were	50	cents	each	.
and	then	i	'd	sell	50	at	a	time	of	all	the	crappy	ones	.
and	they	could	use	those	for	practice	balls	.
i	sold	sunglasses	,	when	i	was	in	school	,	to	all	the	kids	in	high	school	.
this	is	what	really	kind	of	gets	everybody	hating	you	is	because	you	're	trying	to	extract	money	from	all	your	friends	all	the	time	.
but	it	paid	the	bills	.
so	i	sold	lots	and	lots	of	sunglasses	.
then	when	the	school	shut	me	down	--	the	school	actually	called	me	into	the	office	and	told	me	i	could	n't	do	it	--	so	i	went	to	the	gas	stations	and	i	sold	lots	of	them	to	the	gas	stations	and	had	the	gas	stations	sell	them	to	their	customers	.
that	was	cool	because	then	i	had	retail	outlets	.
and	i	think	i	was	14	.
then	i	paid	my	entire	way	through	first	year	university	at	carlton	by	selling	wine	skins	door	to	door	.
you	know	that	you	can	hold	a	40	-	ounce	bottle	of	rum	and	two	bottles	of	coke	in	a	wineskin	?	so	what	,	right	?
yeah	,	but	you	know	what	?	you	stuff	that	down	your	shorts	,	when	you	go	into	a	football	game	you	can	get	booze	in	for	free	,	everybody	bought	them	.
supply	,	demand	,	big	opportunity	.
i	also	branded	it	,	so	i	sold	them	for	five	times	the	normal	cost	.
it	had	our	university	logo	on	it	.
you	know	we	teach	our	kids	and	we	buy	them	games	,	but	why	do	n't	we	get	them	games	,	if	they	're	entrepreneurial	kids	,	that	kind	of	nurture	the	traits	that	you	need	to	be	entrepreneurs	?
why	do	n't	you	teach	them	not	to	waste	money	?
i	remember	being	told	to	walk	out	in	the	middle	of	a	street	in	banff	,	alberta	because	i	'd	thrown	a	penny	out	in	the	street	,	and	my	dad	said	,	``	go	pick	it	up	.	``
he	said	,	``	i	work	too	damn	hard	for	my	money	.	i	'm	not	going	to	see	you	ever	waste	a	penny	.	``
and	i	remember	that	lesson	to	this	day	.
allowances	teach	kids	the	wrong	habits	.
allowances	,	by	nature	,	are	teaching	kids	to	think	about	a	job	.
an	entrepreneur	does	n't	expect	a	regular	paycheck	.
allowance	is	breeding	kids	at	a	young	age	to	expect	a	regular	paycheck	.
that	's	wrong	,	for	me	,	if	you	want	to	raise	entrepreneurs	.
what	i	do	with	my	kids	now	--	i	've	got	two	,	nine	and	seven	--	is	i	teach	them	to	walk	around	the	house	and	the	yard	,	looking	for	stuff	that	needs	to	get	done	.
come	to	me	and	tell	me	what	it	is	.
or	i	'll	come	to	them	and	say	,	``	here	's	what	i	need	done	.	``
and	then	you	know	what	we	do	?	we	negotiate	.
they	go	around	looking	for	what	it	is	.
but	then	we	negotiate	on	what	they	're	going	to	get	paid	.
and	then	they	do	n't	have	a	regular	check	,	but	they	have	more	opportunities	to	find	more	stuff	,	and	they	learn	the	skill	of	negotiating	,	and	they	learn	the	skill	of	finding	opportunities	as	well	.
you	breed	that	kind	of	stuff	.	each	of	my	kids	has	two	piggy	banks	.
fifty	percent	of	all	the	money	that	they	earn	or	get	gifted	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	house	account	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	toy	account	.
anything	in	their	toy	account	they	can	spend	on	whatever	they	want	.
the	50	percent	that	goes	in	their	house	account	,	every	six	months	,	goes	to	the	bank	.
they	walk	up	with	me	.	every	year	all	the	money	in	the	bank	goes	to	their	broker	.
both	my	nine	-	and	seven	-	year	-	olds	have	a	stock	broker	already	.
but	i	'm	teaching	them	to	force	that	savings	habit	.
it	drives	me	crazy	that	30	-	year	-	olds	are	saying	,	``	maybe	i	'll	start	contributing	to	my	rsp	now	.	``
shit	,	you	've	missed	25	years	.
you	can	teach	those	habits	to	young	kids	when	they	do	n't	even	feel	the	pain	yet	.
do	n't	read	them	bedtime	stories	every	night	.
maybe	four	nights	out	of	the	week	read	them	bedtime	stories	and	three	nights	of	the	week	have	them	tell	stories	.
why	do	n't	you	sit	down	with	kids	and	give	them	four	items	,	a	red	shirt	,	a	blue	tie	,	a	kangaroo	and	a	laptop	,	and	have	them	tell	a	story	about	those	four	things	?
my	kids	do	that	all	the	time	.
it	teaches	them	to	sell	;	it	teaches	them	creativity	;	it	teaches	them	to	think	on	their	feet	.
just	do	that	kind	of	stuff	and	have	fun	with	it	.
get	kids	to	stand	up	in	front	of	groups	and	talk	,	even	if	it	's	just	stand	up	in	front	of	their	friends	and	do	plays	and	have	speeches	.
those	are	entrepreneurial	traits	that	you	want	to	be	nurturing	.
show	the	kids	what	bad	customers	or	bad	employees	look	like	.
show	them	the	grumpy	employees	.
when	you	see	grumpy	customer	service	,	point	that	out	to	them	.
say	,	``	by	the	way	,	that	guy	's	a	crappy	employee	.	``
and	say	,	``	these	ones	are	good	ones	.	``
if	you	go	into	a	restaurant	and	you	have	bad	customer	service	,	show	them	what	bad	customer	service	looks	like	.
we	have	all	these	lessons	in	front	of	us	,	but	we	do	n't	take	those	opportunities	;	we	teach	kids	to	go	get	a	tutor	.
imagine	if	you	actually	took	all	the	kids	'	junk	that	's	in	the	house	right	now	,	all	the	toys	that	they	've	outgrown	two	years	ago	and	said	,	``	why	do	n't	we	start	selling	some	of	this	on	craigslist	and	kijiji	?	``
and	they	can	actually	sell	it	and	learn	how	to	find	scammers	when	they	get	email	offers	come	in	.
they	can	come	into	your	account	or	a	sub	account	or	whatever	.
but	teach	them	how	to	fix	the	price	,	guess	the	price	,	pull	up	the	photos	.
teach	them	how	to	do	that	kind	of	stuff	and	make	money	.
then	the	money	they	get	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	house	account	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	toy	account	.
my	kids	love	this	stuff	.
some	of	the	entrepreneurial	traits	that	you	've	got	to	nurture	in	kids	:	attainment	,	tenacity	,	leadership	,	introspection	,	interdependence	,	values	.
all	these	traits	you	can	find	in	young	kids	,	and	you	can	help	nurture	them	.
look	for	that	kind	of	stuff	.
there	's	two	traits	that	i	want	you	to	also	look	out	for	that	we	do	n't	kind	of	get	out	of	their	system	.
do	n't	medicate	kids	for	attention	deficit	disorder	unless	it	is	really	,	really	freaking	bad	.
the	same	with	the	whole	things	on	mania	and	stress	and	depression	,	unless	it	is	so	clinically	brutal	,	man	.
bipolar	disorder	is	nicknamed	the	ceo	disease	.
when	steve	jurvetson	and	jim	clark	and	jim	barksdale	have	all	got	it	,	and	they	built	netscape	--	imagine	if	they	were	given	ritalin	.
we	would	n't	have	have	that	stuff	,	right	?
al	gore	really	would	have	had	to	invented	the	internet	.
these	skills	are	the	skills	we	should	be	teaching	in	the	classroom	as	well	as	everything	else	.
i	'm	not	saying	do	n't	get	kids	to	want	to	be	lawyers	.
but	how	about	getting	entrepreneurship	to	be	ranked	right	up	there	with	the	rest	of	them	as	well	?
because	there	's	huge	opportunities	in	that	.
i	want	to	close	with	a	quick	little	video	.
it	's	a	video	that	was	done	by	one	of	the	companies	that	i	mentor	.
these	guys	,	grasshopper	.
it	's	about	kids	.	it	's	about	entrepreneurship	.
hopefully	this	inspires	you	to	take	what	you	've	heard	from	me	and	do	something	with	it	to	change	the	world	.
