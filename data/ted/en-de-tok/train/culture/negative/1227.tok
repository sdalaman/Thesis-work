erez	lieberman	aiden	:	everyone	knows	that	a	picture	is	worth	a	thousand	words	.
but	we	at	harvard	were	wondering	if	this	was	really	true	.
so	we	assembled	a	team	of	experts	,	spanning	harvard	,	mit	,	the	american	heritage	dictionary	,	the	encyclopedia	britannica	and	even	our	proud	sponsors	,	the	google	.
and	we	cogitated	about	this	for	about	four	years	.
and	we	came	to	a	startling	conclusion	.
ladies	and	gentlemen	,	a	picture	is	not	worth	a	thousand	words	.
in	fact	,	we	found	some	pictures	that	are	worth	500	billion	words	.
jean	-	baptiste	michel	:	so	how	did	we	get	to	this	conclusion	?
so	erez	and	i	were	thinking	about	ways	to	get	a	big	picture	of	human	culture	and	human	history	:	change	over	time	.
so	many	books	actually	have	been	written	over	the	years	.
so	we	were	thinking	,	well	the	best	way	to	learn	from	them	is	to	read	all	of	these	millions	of	books	.
now	of	course	,	if	there	's	a	scale	for	how	awesome	that	is	,	that	has	to	rank	extremely	,	extremely	high	.
now	the	problem	is	there	's	an	x	-	axis	for	that	,	which	is	the	practical	axis	.
this	is	very	,	very	low	.
now	people	tend	to	use	an	alternative	approach	,	which	is	to	take	a	few	sources	and	read	them	very	carefully	.
this	is	extremely	practical	,	but	not	so	awesome	.
what	you	really	want	to	do	is	to	get	to	the	awesome	yet	practical	part	of	this	space	.
so	it	turns	out	there	was	a	company	across	the	river	called	google	who	had	started	a	digitization	project	a	few	years	back	that	might	just	enable	this	approach	.
they	have	digitized	millions	of	books	.
so	what	that	means	is	,	one	could	use	computational	methods	to	read	all	of	the	books	in	a	click	of	a	button	.
that	's	very	practical	and	extremely	awesome	.
ela	:	let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	where	books	come	from	.
since	time	immemorial	,	there	have	been	authors	.
these	authors	have	been	striving	to	write	books	.
and	this	became	considerably	easier	with	the	development	of	the	printing	press	some	centuries	ago	.
since	then	,	the	authors	have	won	on	129	million	distinct	occasions	,	publishing	books	.
now	if	those	books	are	not	lost	to	history	,	then	they	are	somewhere	in	a	library	,	and	many	of	those	books	have	been	getting	retrieved	from	the	libraries	and	digitized	by	google	,	which	has	scanned	15	million	books	to	date	.
now	when	google	digitizes	a	book	,	they	put	it	into	a	really	nice	format	.
now	we	've	got	the	data	,	plus	we	have	metadata	.
we	have	information	about	things	like	where	was	it	published	,	who	was	the	author	,	when	was	it	published	.
and	what	we	do	is	go	through	all	of	those	records	and	exclude	everything	that	's	not	the	highest	quality	data	.
what	we	're	left	with	is	a	collection	of	five	million	books	,	500	billion	words	,	a	string	of	characters	a	thousand	times	longer	than	the	human	genome	--	a	text	which	,	when	written	out	,	would	stretch	from	here	to	the	moon	and	back	10	times	over	--	a	veritable	shard	of	our	cultural	genome	.
of	course	what	we	did	when	faced	with	such	outrageous	hyperbole	...
was	what	any	self	-	respecting	researchers	would	have	done	.
we	took	a	page	out	of	xkcd	,	and	we	said	,	``	stand	back	.
we	're	going	to	try	science	.	``
jm	:	now	of	course	,	we	were	thinking	,	well	let	's	just	first	put	the	data	out	there	for	people	to	do	science	to	it	.
now	we	're	thinking	,	what	data	can	we	release	?
well	of	course	,	you	want	to	take	the	books	and	release	the	full	text	of	these	five	million	books	.
now	google	,	and	jon	orwant	in	particular	,	told	us	a	little	equation	that	we	should	learn	.
so	you	have	five	million	,	that	is	,	five	million	authors	and	five	million	plaintiffs	is	a	massive	lawsuit	.
so	,	although	that	would	be	really	,	really	awesome	,	again	,	that	's	extremely	,	extremely	impractical	.
now	again	,	we	kind	of	caved	in	,	and	we	did	the	very	practical	approach	,	which	was	a	bit	less	awesome	.
we	said	,	well	instead	of	releasing	the	full	text	,	we	're	going	to	release	statistics	about	the	books	.
so	take	for	instance	``	a	gleam	of	happiness	.	``
it	's	four	words	;	we	call	that	a	four	-	gram	.
we	're	going	to	tell	you	how	many	times	a	particular	four	-	gram	appeared	in	books	in	1801	,	1802	,	1803	,	all	the	way	up	to	2008	.
that	gives	us	a	time	series	of	how	frequently	this	particular	sentence	was	used	over	time	.
we	do	that	for	all	the	words	and	phrases	that	appear	in	those	books	,	and	that	gives	us	a	big	table	of	two	billion	lines	that	tell	us	about	the	way	culture	has	been	changing	.
ela	:	so	those	two	billion	lines	,	we	call	them	two	billion	n	-	grams	.
what	do	they	tell	us	?
well	the	individual	n	-	grams	measure	cultural	trends	.
let	me	give	you	an	example	.
let	's	suppose	that	i	am	thriving	,	then	tomorrow	i	want	to	tell	you	about	how	well	i	did	.
and	so	i	might	say	,	``	yesterday	,	i	throve	.	``
alternatively	,	i	could	say	,	``	yesterday	,	i	thrived	.	``
well	which	one	should	i	use	?
how	to	know	?
as	of	about	six	months	ago	,	the	state	of	the	art	in	this	field	is	that	you	would	,	for	instance	,	go	up	to	the	following	psychologist	with	fabulous	hair	,	and	you	'd	say	,	``	steve	,	you	're	an	expert	on	the	irregular	verbs	.
what	should	i	do	?	``
and	he	'd	tell	you	,	``	well	most	people	say	thrived	,	but	some	people	say	throve	.	``
and	you	also	knew	,	more	or	less	,	that	if	you	were	to	go	back	in	time	200	years	and	ask	the	following	statesman	with	equally	fabulous	hair	,	``	tom	,	what	should	i	say	?	``
he	'd	say	,	``	well	,	in	my	day	,	most	people	throve	,	but	some	thrived	.	``
so	now	what	i	'm	just	going	to	show	you	is	raw	data	.
two	rows	from	this	table	of	two	billion	entries	.
what	you	're	seeing	is	year	by	year	frequency	of	``	thrived	``	and	``	throve	``	over	time	.
now	this	is	just	two	out	of	two	billion	rows	.
so	the	entire	data	set	is	a	billion	times	more	awesome	than	this	slide	.
jm	:	now	there	are	many	other	pictures	that	are	worth	500	billion	words	.
for	instance	,	this	one	.
if	you	just	take	influenza	,	you	will	see	peaks	at	the	time	where	you	knew	big	flu	epidemics	were	killing	people	around	the	globe	.
ela	:	if	you	were	not	yet	convinced	,	sea	levels	are	rising	,	so	is	atmospheric	co	2	and	global	temperature	.
jm	:	you	might	also	want	to	have	a	look	at	this	particular	n	-	gram	,	and	that	's	to	tell	nietzsche	that	god	is	not	dead	,	although	you	might	agree	that	he	might	need	a	better	publicist	.
ela	:	you	can	get	at	some	pretty	abstract	concepts	with	this	sort	of	thing	.
for	instance	,	let	me	tell	you	the	history	of	the	year	1950	.
pretty	much	for	the	vast	majority	of	history	,	no	one	gave	a	damn	about	1950	.
in	1700	,	in	1800	,	in	1900	,	no	one	cared	.
through	the	30s	and	40s	,	no	one	cared	.
suddenly	,	in	the	mid	-	40s	,	there	started	to	be	a	buzz	.
people	realized	that	1950	was	going	to	happen	,	and	it	could	be	big	.
but	nothing	got	people	interested	in	1950	like	the	year	1950	.
people	were	walking	around	obsessed	.
they	could	n't	stop	talking	about	all	the	things	they	did	in	1950	,	all	the	things	they	were	planning	to	do	in	1950	,	all	the	dreams	of	what	they	wanted	to	accomplish	in	1950	.
in	fact	,	1950	was	so	fascinating	that	for	years	thereafter	,	people	just	kept	talking	about	all	the	amazing	things	that	happened	,	in	'51	,	'52	,	'53	.
finally	in	1954	,	someone	woke	up	and	realized	that	1950	had	gotten	somewhat	pass√©	.
and	just	like	that	,	the	bubble	burst	.
and	the	story	of	1950	is	the	story	of	every	year	that	we	have	on	record	,	with	a	little	twist	,	because	now	we	've	got	these	nice	charts	.
and	because	we	have	these	nice	charts	,	we	can	measure	things	.
we	can	say	,	``	well	how	fast	does	the	bubble	burst	?	``
and	it	turns	out	that	we	can	measure	that	very	precisely	.
equations	were	derived	,	graphs	were	produced	,	and	the	net	result	is	that	we	find	that	the	bubble	bursts	faster	and	faster	with	each	passing	year	.
we	are	losing	interest	in	the	past	more	rapidly	.
jm	:	now	a	little	piece	of	career	advice	.
so	for	those	of	you	who	seek	to	be	famous	,	we	can	learn	from	the	25	most	famous	political	figures	,	authors	,	actors	and	so	on	.
so	if	you	want	to	become	famous	early	on	,	you	should	be	an	actor	,	because	then	fame	starts	rising	by	the	end	of	your	20s	--	you	're	still	young	,	it	's	really	great	.
now	if	you	can	wait	a	little	bit	,	you	should	be	an	author	,	because	then	you	rise	to	very	great	heights	,	like	mark	twain	,	for	instance	:	extremely	famous	.
but	if	you	want	to	reach	the	very	top	,	you	should	delay	gratification	and	,	of	course	,	become	a	politician	.
so	here	you	will	become	famous	by	the	end	of	your	50s	,	and	become	very	,	very	famous	afterward	.
so	scientists	also	tend	to	get	famous	when	they	're	much	older	.
like	for	instance	,	biologists	and	physics	tend	to	be	almost	as	famous	as	actors	.
one	mistake	you	should	not	do	is	become	a	mathematician	.
if	you	do	that	,	you	might	think	,	``	oh	great	.	i	'm	going	to	do	my	best	work	when	i	'm	in	my	20s	.	``
but	guess	what	,	nobody	will	really	care	.
ela	:	there	are	more	sobering	notes	among	the	n	-	grams	.
for	instance	,	here	's	the	trajectory	of	marc	chagall	,	an	artist	born	in	1887	.
and	this	looks	like	the	normal	trajectory	of	a	famous	person	.
he	gets	more	and	more	and	more	famous	,	except	if	you	look	in	german	.
if	you	look	in	german	,	you	see	something	completely	bizarre	,	something	you	pretty	much	never	see	,	which	is	he	becomes	extremely	famous	and	then	all	of	a	sudden	plummets	,	going	through	a	nadir	between	1933	and	1945	,	before	rebounding	afterward	.
and	of	course	,	what	we	're	seeing	is	the	fact	marc	chagall	was	a	jewish	artist	in	nazi	germany	.
now	these	signals	are	actually	so	strong	that	we	do	n't	need	to	know	that	someone	was	censored	.
we	can	actually	figure	it	out	using	really	basic	signal	processing	.
here	's	a	simple	way	to	do	it	.
well	,	a	reasonable	expectation	is	that	somebody	's	fame	in	a	given	period	of	time	should	be	roughly	the	average	of	their	fame	before	and	their	fame	after	.
so	that	's	sort	of	what	we	expect	.
and	we	compare	that	to	the	fame	that	we	observe	.
and	we	just	divide	one	by	the	other	to	produce	something	we	call	a	suppression	index	.
if	the	suppression	index	is	very	,	very	,	very	small	,	then	you	very	well	might	be	being	suppressed	.
if	it	's	very	large	,	maybe	you	're	benefiting	from	propaganda	.
jm	:	now	you	can	actually	look	at	the	distribution	of	suppression	indexes	over	whole	populations	.
so	for	instance	,	here	--	this	suppression	index	is	for	5,000	people	picked	in	english	books	where	there	's	no	known	suppression	--	it	would	be	like	this	,	basically	tightly	centered	on	one	.
what	you	expect	is	basically	what	you	observe	.
this	is	distribution	as	seen	in	germany	--	very	different	,	it	's	shifted	to	the	left	.
people	talked	about	it	twice	less	as	it	should	have	been	.
but	much	more	importantly	,	the	distribution	is	much	wider	.
there	are	many	people	who	end	up	on	the	far	left	on	this	distribution	who	are	talked	about	10	times	fewer	than	they	should	have	been	.
but	then	also	many	people	on	the	far	right	who	seem	to	benefit	from	propaganda	.
this	picture	is	the	hallmark	of	censorship	in	the	book	record	.
ela	:	so	culturomics	is	what	we	call	this	method	.
it	's	kind	of	like	genomics	.
except	genomics	is	a	lens	on	biology	through	the	window	of	the	sequence	of	bases	in	the	human	genome	.
culturomics	is	similar	.
it	's	the	application	of	massive	-	scale	data	collection	analysis	to	the	study	of	human	culture	.
here	,	instead	of	through	the	lens	of	a	genome	,	through	the	lens	of	digitized	pieces	of	the	historical	record	.
the	great	thing	about	culturomics	is	that	everyone	can	do	it	.
why	can	everyone	do	it	?
everyone	can	do	it	because	three	guys	,	jon	orwant	,	matt	gray	and	will	brockman	over	at	google	,	saw	the	prototype	of	the	ngram	viewer	,	and	they	said	,	``	this	is	so	fun	.
we	have	to	make	this	available	for	people	.	``
so	in	two	weeks	flat	--	the	two	weeks	before	our	paper	came	out	--	they	coded	up	a	version	of	the	ngram	viewer	for	the	general	public	.
and	so	you	too	can	type	in	any	word	or	phrase	that	you	're	interested	in	and	see	its	n	-	gram	immediately	--	also	browse	examples	of	all	the	various	books	in	which	your	n	-	gram	appears	.
jm	:	now	this	was	used	over	a	million	times	on	the	first	day	,	and	this	is	really	the	best	of	all	the	queries	.
so	people	want	to	be	their	best	,	put	their	best	foot	forward	.
but	it	turns	out	in	the	18th	century	,	people	did	n't	really	care	about	that	at	all	.
they	did	n't	want	to	be	their	best	,	they	wanted	to	be	their	beft	.
so	what	happened	is	,	of	course	,	this	is	just	a	mistake	.
it	's	not	that	strove	for	mediocrity	,	it	's	just	that	the	s	used	to	be	written	differently	,	kind	of	like	an	f	.
now	of	course	,	google	did	n't	pick	this	up	at	the	time	,	so	we	reported	this	in	the	science	article	that	we	wrote	.
but	it	turns	out	this	is	just	a	reminder	that	,	although	this	is	a	lot	of	fun	,	when	you	interpret	these	graphs	,	you	have	to	be	very	careful	,	and	you	have	to	adopt	the	base	standards	in	the	sciences	.
ela	:	people	have	been	using	this	for	all	kinds	of	fun	purposes	.
actually	,	we	're	not	going	to	have	to	talk	,	we	're	just	going	to	show	you	all	the	slides	and	remain	silent	.
this	person	was	interested	in	the	history	of	frustration	.
there	's	various	types	of	frustration	.
if	you	stub	your	toe	,	that	's	a	one	a	``	argh	.	``
if	the	planet	earth	is	annihilated	by	the	vogons	to	make	room	for	an	interstellar	bypass	,	that	's	an	eight	a	``	aaaaaaaargh	.	``
this	person	studies	all	the	``	arghs	,	``	from	one	through	eight	a	's	.
and	it	turns	out	that	the	less	-	frequent	``	arghs	``	are	,	of	course	,	the	ones	that	correspond	to	things	that	are	more	frustrating	--	except	,	oddly	,	in	the	early	80s	.
we	think	that	might	have	something	to	do	with	reagan	.
jm	:	there	are	many	usages	of	this	data	,	but	the	bottom	line	is	that	the	historical	record	is	being	digitized	.
google	has	started	to	digitize	15	million	books	.
that	's	12	percent	of	all	the	books	that	have	ever	been	published	.
it	's	a	sizable	chunk	of	human	culture	.
there	's	much	more	in	culture	:	there	's	manuscripts	,	there	newspapers	,	there	's	things	that	are	not	text	,	like	art	and	paintings	.
these	all	happen	to	be	on	our	computers	,	on	computers	across	the	world	.
and	when	that	happens	,	that	will	transform	the	way	we	have	to	understand	our	past	,	our	present	and	human	culture	.
thank	you	very	much	.
