♫	my	age	is	three	hundred	♫	♫	and	seventy	-	two	♫	♫	i	think	with	the	deepest	regret	♫	♫	how	i	used	to	pick	up	and	voraciously	chew	♫	♫	the	dear	little	boys	that	i	met	♫	♫	i	've	eaten	them	raw	in	their	holiday	suits	,	♫	♫	eaten	them	curried	with	rice	,	♫	♫	i	've	eaten	them	baked	in	their	jackets	and	boots	,	♫	♫	and	found	them	exceedingly	nice	.	♫	♫	but	now	that	my	jaws	are	too	weak	for	such	fare	,	♫	♫	i	think	it	's	increasingly	rude	♫	♫	to	do	such	a	thing	when	i	'm	quite	well	aware	♫	♫	little	boys	do	not	like	being	chewed	.	♫	♫	little	boys	do	not	like	being	chewed	.	♫	♫	so	now	i	contentedly	live	upon	eels	,	♫	♫	and	try	to	do	nothing	amiss	♫	♫	and	pass	all	the	time	i	can	spare	from	my	meals	♫	♫	in	innocent	slumber	like	this	,	♫	♫	innocent	slumber	like	this	.	♫	i	suppose	i	owe	you	an	explanation	.
i	've	been	working	on	a	project	for	the	last	six	years	adapting	children	's	poetry	to	music	.
and	that	's	a	poem	by	charles	edward	carryl	,	who	was	a	stockbroker	in	new	york	city	for	45	years	,	but	in	the	evenings	,	he	wrote	nonsense	for	his	children	.
and	this	book	was	one	of	the	most	famous	books	in	america	for	about	35	years	.
``	the	sleepy	giant	,	``	which	is	the	song	that	i	just	sang	,	is	one	of	his	poems	.
now	,	we	're	going	to	do	other	poems	for	you	,	and	here	's	a	preview	of	some	of	the	poets	.
this	is	rachel	field	,	robert	graves	--	a	very	young	robert	graves	--	christina	rossetti	.
ghosts	,	right	?
have	nothing	to	say	to	us	,	obsolete	,	gone	--	not	so	.
what	i	really	enjoyed	about	this	project	is	reviving	these	people	's	words	.
taking	them	off	the	dead	,	flat	pages	.
bringing	them	to	life	,	bringing	them	to	light	.
so	,	what	we	're	going	to	do	next	is	a	poem	that	was	written	by	nathalia	crane	.
nathalia	crane	was	a	little	girl	from	brooklyn	.
when	she	was	10	years	old	in	1927	,	she	published	her	first	book	of	poems	called	``	the	janitor	's	boy	.	``
here	she	is	.
and	here	's	her	poem	.
♫	oh	,	i	'm	in	love	with	the	janitor	's	boy	,	♫	♫	and	the	janitor	's	boy	is	in	love	with	me	.	♫	♫	oh	,	i	'm	in	love	with	the	janitor	's	boy	,	♫	♫	and	the	janitor	's	boy	is	in	love	with	me	.	♫	♫	he	's	going	to	hunt	for	a	desert	isle	♫	♫	in	our	geography	.	♫	♫	a	desert	isle	with	spicy	trees	♫	♫	somewhere	in	sheepshead	bay	;	♫	♫	a	right	nice	place	,	just	fit	for	two	♫	♫	where	we	can	live	always	.	♫	♫	oh	,	i	'm	in	love	with	the	janitor	's	boy	,	♫	♫	and	the	janitor	's	boy	,	♫	he	's	busy	as	can	be	;	♫	♫	down	in	the	cellar	he	's	making	a	raft	♫	♫	out	of	an	old	settee	.	♫	♫	he	'll	carry	me	off	,	i	know	that	he	will	,	♫	♫	for	his	hair	is	exceedingly	red	;	♫	♫	and	the	only	thing	that	occurs	to	me	♫	♫	is	to	dutifully	shiver	in	bed	.	♫	♫	and	on	the	day	that	we	sail	,	i	will	leave	a	little	note	♫	♫	for	my	parents	i	hate	to	annoy	:	♫	♫	``	i	have	flown	to	an	island	in	the	bay	♫	♫	with	my	janitor	's	red	haired	-	boy	.	``	♫	♫	the	janitor	's	red	-	haired	boy	♫	♫	the	janitor	's	red	-	haired	boy	♫	♫	the	janitor	's	red	-	haired	boy	♫	♫	the	janitor	's	red	-	haired	boy	♫	♫	i	'm	going	to	sail	away	♫	♫	gone	to	sheepshead	bay	♫	♫	with	my	janitor	's	red	-	haired	boy	.	♫	♫	on	an	old	settee	♫	♫	my	red	-	haired	boy	and	me	♫	♫	the	janitor	's	red	-	haired	boy	.	♫	♫	the	janitor	's	red	-	haired	boy	♫	♫	the	janitor	's	red	-	haired	boy	♫	♫	the	janitor	's	red	-	haired	boy	♫	♫	the	janitor	's	red	-	haired	boy	♫	the	next	poem	is	by	e.e	.	cummings	,	``	maggie	and	milly	and	molly	and	may	.	``
♫	maggie	and	milly	,	molly	and	may	♫	♫	they	went	down	to	the	beach	one	day	to	play	♫	♫	and	maggie	discovered	a	shell	that	sang	♫	♫	so	sweetly	she	could	n't	remember	her	troubles	♫	♫	maggie	and	milly	,	molly	and	may	♫	♫	maggie	and	milly	,	molly	and	may	♫	♫	milly	befriended	a	stranded	star	♫	♫	whose	rays	,	whose	rays	♫	♫	five	languid	fingers	were	♫	♫	maggie	and	milly	,	molly	and	may	♫	♫	maggie	and	milly	,	molly	and	may	♫	♫	molly	was	chased	by	a	horrible	thing	♫	♫	which	raced	sideways	blowing	♫	♫	blowing	♫	♫	blowing	♫	♫	may	came	home	with	a	smooth	,	round	stone	♫	♫	small	as	a	world	and	as	large	as	alone	♫	♫	for	whatever	we	lose	like	a	you	or	a	me	♫	♫	always	ourselves	that	we	find	at	the	sea	♫	thank	you	.
the	next	poem	is	``	if	no	one	ever	marries	me	.	``
it	was	written	by	laurence	alma	-	tadema	.
she	was	the	daughter	of	a	very	,	very	famous	dutch	painter	who	had	made	his	fame	in	england	.
he	went	there	after	the	death	of	his	wife	of	smallpox	and	brought	his	two	young	children	.
one	was	his	daughter	,	laurence	.
she	wrote	this	poem	when	she	was	18	years	old	in	1888	,	and	i	look	at	it	as	kind	of	a	very	sweet	feminist	manifesto	tinged	with	a	little	bit	of	defiance	and	a	little	bit	of	resignation	and	regret	.
♫	well	,	if	no	one	ever	marries	me	♫	♫	and	i	do	n't	see	why	they	should	,	♫	♫	nurse	says	i	'm	not	pretty	,	♫	♫	and	you	know	i	'm	seldom	good	,	seldom	good	--	♫	♫	well	,	if	no	one	ever	marries	me	♫	♫	i	sha	n't	mind	very	much	;	♫	♫	buy	a	squirrel	in	a	cage	♫	♫	and	a	little	rabbit	-	hutch	.	♫	♫	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	♫	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	♫	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	♫	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	♫	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	♫	i	'll	have	a	cottage	near	a	wood	♫	♫	and	a	pony	all	my	own	♫	♫	a	little	lamb	quite	clean	and	tame	♫	♫	that	i	can	take	to	town	.	♫	♫	and	when	i	'm	really	getting	old	--	♫	♫	and	28	or	nine	--	♫	♫	buy	myself	a	little	orphan	girl	♫	♫	and	bring	her	up	as	mine	.	♫	♫	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	♫	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	♫	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	♫	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	♫	well	,	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	♫	marries	me	♫	♫	well	,	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	♫	marries	me	♫	♫	well	,	if	no	one	marries	me	♫	thank	you	.
i	became	very	curious	about	the	poets	after	spending	six	years	with	them	,	and	started	to	research	their	lives	,	and	then	decided	to	write	a	book	about	it	.
and	the	burning	question	about	alma	-	tadema	was	:	did	she	marry	?
and	the	answer	was	no	,	which	i	found	in	the	london	times	archive	.
she	died	alone	in	1940	in	the	company	of	her	books	and	her	dear	friends	.
gerard	manley	hopkins	,	a	saintly	man	.
he	became	a	jesuit	.
he	converted	from	his	anglican	faith	.
he	was	moved	to	by	the	tractarian	movement	,	the	oxford	movement	,	otherwise	known	as	--	and	he	became	a	jesuit	priest	.
he	burned	all	his	poetry	at	the	age	of	24	and	then	did	not	write	another	poem	for	at	least	seven	years	because	he	could	n't	rectify	the	life	of	a	poet	with	the	life	of	a	priest	.
he	died	typhoid	fever	at	the	age	of	44	,	i	believe	,	43	or	44	.
at	the	time	,	he	was	teaching	classics	at	trinity	college	in	dublin	.
a	few	years	before	he	died	,	after	he	had	resumed	writing	poetry	,	but	in	secret	,	he	confessed	to	a	friend	in	a	letter	that	i	found	when	i	was	doing	my	research	:	``	i	've	written	a	verse	.
it	is	to	explain	death	to	a	child	,	and	it	deserves	a	piece	of	plain	-	song	music	.	``
and	my	blood	froze	when	i	read	that	because	i	had	written	the	plain	-	song	music	130	years	after	he	'd	written	the	letter	.
and	the	poem	is	called	,	``	spring	and	fall	.	``
