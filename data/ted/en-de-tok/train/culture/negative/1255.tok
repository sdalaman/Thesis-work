thank	you	.
it	's	a	real	pleasure	to	be	here	.
i	last	did	a	tedtalk	i	think	about	seven	years	ago	or	so	.
i	talked	about	spaghetti	sauce	.
and	so	many	people	,	i	guess	,	watch	those	videos	.
people	have	been	coming	up	to	me	ever	since	to	ask	me	questions	about	spaghetti	sauce	,	which	is	a	wonderful	thing	in	the	short	term	--	but	it	's	proven	to	be	less	than	ideal	over	seven	years	.
and	so	i	though	i	would	come	and	try	and	put	spaghetti	sauce	behind	me	.
the	theme	of	this	morning	's	session	is	things	we	make	.
and	so	i	thought	i	would	tell	a	story	about	someone	who	made	one	of	the	most	precious	objects	of	his	era	.
and	the	man	's	name	is	carl	norden	.
carl	norden	was	born	in	1880	.
and	he	was	swiss	.
and	of	course	,	the	swiss	can	be	divided	into	two	general	categories	:	those	who	make	small	,	exquisite	,	expensive	objects	and	those	who	handle	the	money	of	those	who	buy	small	,	exquisite	,	expensive	objects	.
and	carl	norden	is	very	firmly	in	the	former	camp	.
he	's	an	engineer	.
he	goes	to	the	federal	polytech	in	zurich	.
in	fact	,	one	of	his	classmates	is	a	young	man	named	lenin	who	would	go	on	to	break	small	,	expensive	,	exquisite	objects	.
and	he	's	a	swiss	engineer	,	carl	.
and	i	mean	that	in	its	fullest	sense	of	the	word	.
he	wears	three	-	piece	suits	;	and	he	has	a	very	,	very	small	,	important	mustache	;	and	he	is	domineering	and	narcissistic	and	driven	and	has	an	extraordinary	ego	;	and	he	works	16	-	hour	days	;	and	he	has	very	strong	feelings	about	alternating	current	;	and	he	feels	like	a	suntan	is	a	sign	of	moral	weakness	;	and	he	drinks	lots	of	coffee	;	and	he	does	his	best	work	sitting	in	his	mother	's	kitchen	in	zurich	for	hours	in	complete	silence	with	nothing	but	a	slide	rule	.
in	any	case	,	carl	norden	emigrates	to	the	united	states	just	before	the	first	world	war	and	sets	up	shop	on	lafayette	street	in	downtown	manhattan	.
and	he	becomes	obsessed	with	the	question	of	how	to	drop	bombs	from	an	airplane	.
now	if	you	think	about	it	,	in	the	age	before	gps	and	radar	,	that	was	obviously	a	really	difficult	problem	.
it	's	a	complicated	physics	problem	.
you	've	got	a	plane	that	's	thousands	of	feet	up	in	the	air	,	going	at	hundreds	of	miles	an	hour	,	and	you	're	trying	to	drop	an	object	,	a	bomb	,	towards	some	stationary	target	in	the	face	of	all	kinds	of	winds	and	cloud	cover	and	all	kinds	of	other	impediments	.
and	all	sorts	of	people	,	moving	up	to	the	first	world	war	and	between	the	wars	,	tried	to	solve	this	problem	,	and	nearly	everybody	came	up	short	.
the	bombsights	that	were	available	were	incredibly	crude	.
but	carl	norden	is	really	the	one	who	cracks	the	code	.
and	he	comes	up	with	this	incredibly	complicated	device	.
it	weighs	about	50	lbs	.
it	's	called	the	norden	mark	15	bombsight	.
and	it	has	all	kinds	of	levers	and	ball	-	bearings	and	gadgets	and	gauges	.
and	he	makes	this	complicated	thing	.
and	what	he	allows	people	to	do	is	he	makes	the	bombardier	take	this	particular	object	,	visually	sight	the	target	,	because	they	're	in	the	plexiglas	cone	of	the	bomber	,	and	then	they	plug	in	the	altitude	of	the	plane	,	the	speed	of	the	plane	,	the	speed	of	the	wind	and	the	coordinates	of	the	target	.
and	the	bombsight	will	tell	him	when	to	drop	the	bomb	.
and	as	norden	famously	says	,	``	before	that	bombsight	came	along	,	bombs	would	routinely	miss	their	target	by	a	mile	or	more	.	``
but	he	said	,	with	the	mark	15	norden	bombsight	,	he	could	drop	a	bomb	into	a	pickle	barrel	at	20,000	ft	.
now	i	can	not	tell	you	how	incredibly	excited	the	u.s.	military	was	by	the	news	of	the	norden	bombsight	.
it	was	like	manna	from	heaven	.
here	was	an	army	that	had	just	had	experience	in	the	first	world	war	,	where	millions	of	men	fought	each	other	in	the	trenches	,	getting	nowhere	,	making	no	progress	,	and	here	someone	had	come	up	with	a	device	that	allowed	them	to	fly	up	in	the	skies	high	above	enemy	territory	and	destroy	whatever	they	wanted	with	pinpoint	accuracy	.
and	the	u.s.	military	spends	1.5	billion	dollars	--	billion	dollars	in	1940	dollars	--	developing	the	norden	bombsight	.
and	to	put	that	in	perspective	,	the	total	cost	of	the	manhattan	project	was	three	billion	dollars	.
half	as	much	money	was	spent	on	this	norden	bombsight	as	was	spent	on	the	most	famous	military	-	industrial	project	of	the	modern	era	.
and	there	were	people	,	strategists	,	within	the	u.s.	military	who	genuinely	thought	that	this	single	device	was	going	to	spell	the	difference	between	defeat	and	victory	when	it	came	to	the	battle	against	the	nazis	and	against	the	japanese	.
and	for	norden	as	well	,	this	device	had	incredible	moral	importance	,	because	norden	was	a	committed	christian	.
in	fact	,	he	would	always	get	upset	when	people	referred	to	the	bombsight	as	his	invention	,	because	in	his	eyes	,	only	god	could	invent	things	.
he	was	simple	the	instrument	of	god	's	will	.
and	what	was	god	's	will	?
well	god	's	will	was	that	the	amount	of	suffering	in	any	kind	of	war	be	reduced	to	as	small	an	amount	as	possible	.
and	what	did	the	norden	bombsight	do	?
well	it	allowed	you	to	do	that	.
it	allowed	you	to	bomb	only	those	things	that	you	absolutely	needed	and	wanted	to	bomb	.
so	in	the	years	leading	up	to	the	second	world	war	,	the	u.s.	military	buys	90,000	of	these	norden	bombsights	at	a	cost	of	$	14,000	each	--	again	,	in	1940	dollars	,	that	's	a	lot	of	money	.
and	they	trained	50,000	bombardiers	on	how	to	use	them	--	long	extensive	,	months	-	long	training	sessions	--	because	these	things	are	essentially	analog	computers	;	they	're	not	easy	to	use	.
and	they	make	everyone	of	those	bombardiers	take	an	oath	,	to	swear	that	if	they	're	ever	captured	,	they	will	not	divulge	a	single	detail	of	this	particular	device	to	the	enemy	,	because	it	's	imperative	the	enemy	not	get	their	hands	on	this	absolutely	essential	piece	of	technology	.
and	whenever	the	norden	bombsight	is	taken	onto	a	plane	,	it	's	escorted	there	by	a	series	of	armed	guards	.
and	it	's	carried	in	a	box	with	a	canvas	shroud	over	it	.
and	the	box	is	handcuffed	to	one	of	the	guards	.
it	's	never	allowed	to	be	photographed	.
and	there	's	a	little	incendiary	device	inside	of	it	,	so	that	,	if	the	plane	ever	crashes	,	it	will	be	destroyed	and	there	's	no	way	the	enemy	can	ever	get	their	hands	on	it	.
the	norden	bombsight	is	the	holy	grail	.
so	what	happens	during	the	second	world	war	?
well	,	it	turns	out	it	's	not	the	holy	grail	.
in	practice	,	the	norden	bombsight	can	drop	a	bomb	into	a	pickle	barrel	at	20,000	ft.	,	but	that	's	under	perfect	conditions	.
and	of	course	,	in	wartime	,	conditions	are	n't	perfect	.
first	of	all	,	it	's	really	hard	to	use	--	really	hard	to	use	.
and	not	all	of	the	people	who	are	of	those	50,000	men	who	are	bombardiers	have	the	ability	to	properly	program	an	analog	computer	.
secondly	,	it	breaks	down	a	lot	.
it	's	full	of	all	kinds	of	gyroscopes	and	pulleys	and	gadgets	and	ball	-	bearings	,	and	they	do	n't	work	as	well	as	they	ought	to	in	the	heat	of	battle	.
thirdly	,	when	norden	was	making	his	calculations	,	he	assumed	that	a	plane	would	be	flying	at	a	relatively	slow	speed	at	low	altitudes	.
well	in	a	real	war	,	you	ca	n't	do	that	;	you	'll	get	shot	down	.
so	they	started	flying	them	at	high	altitudes	at	incredibly	high	speeds	.
and	the	norden	bombsight	does	n't	work	as	well	under	those	conditions	.
but	most	of	all	,	the	norden	bombsight	required	the	bombardier	to	make	visual	contact	with	the	target	.
but	of	course	,	what	happens	in	real	life	?
there	are	clouds	,	right	.
it	needs	cloudless	sky	to	be	really	accurate	.
well	how	many	cloudless	skies	do	you	think	there	were	above	central	europe	between	1940	and	1945	?
not	a	lot	.
and	then	to	give	you	a	sense	of	just	how	inaccurate	the	norden	bombsight	was	,	there	was	a	famous	case	in	1944	where	the	allies	bombed	a	chemical	plant	in	leuna	,	germany	.
and	the	chemical	plant	comprised	757	acres	.
and	over	the	course	of	22	bombing	missions	,	the	allies	dropped	85,000	bombs	on	this	757	acre	chemical	plant	,	using	the	norden	bombsight	.
well	what	percentage	of	those	bombs	do	you	think	actually	landed	inside	the	700	-	acre	perimeter	of	the	plant	?
10	percent	.	10	percent	.
and	of	those	10	percent	that	landed	,	16	percent	did	n't	even	go	off	;	they	were	duds	.
the	leuna	chemical	plant	,	after	one	of	the	most	extensive	bombings	in	the	history	of	the	war	,	was	up	and	running	within	weeks	.
and	by	the	way	,	all	those	precautions	to	keep	the	norden	bombsight	out	of	the	hands	of	the	nazis	?
well	it	turns	out	that	carl	norden	,	as	a	proper	swiss	,	was	very	enamored	of	german	engineers	.
so	in	the	1930s	,	he	hired	a	whole	bunch	of	them	,	including	a	man	named	hermann	long	who	,	in	1938	,	gave	a	complete	set	of	the	plans	for	the	norden	bombsight	to	the	nazis	.
so	they	had	their	own	norden	bombsight	throughout	the	entire	war	--	which	also	,	by	the	way	,	did	n't	work	very	well	.
so	why	do	we	talk	about	the	norden	bombsight	?
well	because	we	live	in	an	age	where	there	are	lots	and	lots	of	norden	bombsights	.
we	live	in	a	time	where	there	are	all	kinds	of	really	,	really	smart	people	running	around	,	saying	that	they	've	invented	gadgets	that	will	forever	change	our	world	.
they	've	invented	websites	that	will	allow	people	to	be	free	.
they	've	invented	some	kind	of	this	thing	,	or	this	thing	,	or	this	thing	that	will	make	our	world	forever	better	.
if	you	go	into	the	military	,	you	'll	find	lots	of	carl	nordens	as	well	.
if	you	go	to	the	pentagon	,	they	will	say	,	``	you	know	what	,	now	we	really	can	put	a	bomb	inside	a	pickle	barrel	at	20,000	ft.	``
and	you	know	what	,	it	's	true	;	they	actually	can	do	that	now	.
but	we	need	to	be	very	clear	about	how	little	that	means	.
in	the	iraq	war	,	at	the	beginning	of	the	first	iraq	war	,	the	u.s.	military	,	the	air	force	,	sent	two	squadrons	of	f	-	15e	fighter	eagles	to	the	iraqi	desert	equipped	with	these	five	million	dollar	cameras	that	allowed	them	to	see	the	entire	desert	floor	.
and	their	mission	was	to	find	and	to	destroy	--	remember	the	scud	missile	launchers	,	those	surface	-	to	-	air	missiles	that	the	iraqis	were	launching	at	the	israelis	?
the	mission	of	the	two	squadrons	was	to	get	rid	of	all	the	scud	missile	launchers	.
and	so	they	flew	missions	day	and	night	,	and	they	dropped	thousands	of	bombs	,	and	they	fired	thousands	of	missiles	in	an	attempt	to	get	rid	of	this	particular	scourge	.
and	after	the	war	was	over	,	there	was	an	audit	done	--	as	the	army	always	does	,	the	air	force	always	does	--	and	they	asked	the	question	:	how	many	scuds	did	we	actually	destroy	?
you	know	what	the	answer	was	?
zero	,	not	a	single	one	.
now	why	is	that	?
is	it	because	their	weapons	were	n't	accurate	?
oh	no	,	they	were	brilliantly	accurate	.
they	could	have	destroyed	this	little	thing	right	here	from	25,000	ft	.
the	issue	was	they	did	n't	know	where	the	scud	launchers	were	.
the	problem	with	bombs	and	pickle	barrels	is	not	getting	the	bomb	inside	the	pickle	barrel	,	it	's	knowing	how	to	find	the	pickle	barrel	.
that	's	always	been	the	harder	problem	when	it	comes	to	fighting	wars	.
or	take	the	battle	in	afghanistan	.
what	is	the	signature	weapon	of	the	cia	's	war	in	northwest	pakistan	?
it	's	the	drone	.	what	is	the	drone	?
well	it	is	the	grandson	of	the	norden	mark	15	bombsight	.
it	is	this	weapon	of	devastating	accuracy	and	precision	.
and	over	the	course	of	the	last	six	years	in	northwest	pakistan	,	the	cia	has	flown	hundreds	of	drone	missiles	,	and	it	's	used	those	drones	to	kill	2,000	suspected	pakistani	and	taliban	militants	.
now	what	is	the	accuracy	of	those	drones	?
well	it	's	extraordinary	.
we	think	we	're	now	at	95	percent	accuracy	when	it	comes	to	drone	strikes	.
95	percent	of	the	people	we	kill	need	to	be	killed	,	right	?
that	is	one	of	the	most	extraordinary	records	in	the	history	of	modern	warfare	.
but	do	you	know	what	the	crucial	thing	is	?
in	that	exact	same	period	that	we	've	been	using	these	drones	with	devastating	accuracy	,	the	number	of	attacks	,	of	suicide	attacks	and	terrorist	attacks	,	against	american	forces	in	afghanistan	has	increased	tenfold	.
as	we	have	gotten	more	and	more	efficient	in	killing	them	,	they	have	become	angrier	and	angrier	and	more	and	more	motivated	to	kill	us	.
i	have	not	described	to	you	a	success	story	.
i	've	described	to	you	the	opposite	of	a	success	story	.
and	this	is	the	problem	with	our	infatuation	with	the	things	we	make	.
we	think	the	things	we	make	can	solve	our	problems	,	but	our	problems	are	much	more	complex	than	that	.
the	issue	is	n't	the	accuracy	of	the	bombs	you	have	,	it	's	how	you	use	the	bombs	you	have	,	and	more	importantly	,	whether	you	ought	to	use	bombs	at	all	.
there	's	a	postscript	to	the	norden	story	of	carl	norden	and	his	fabulous	bombsight	.
and	that	is	,	on	august	6th	,	1945	,	a	b	-	29	bomber	called	the	enola	gay	flew	over	japan	and	,	using	a	norden	bombsight	,	dropped	a	very	large	thermonuclear	device	on	the	city	of	hiroshima	.
and	as	was	typical	with	the	norden	bombsight	,	the	bomb	actually	missed	its	target	by	800	ft	.
but	of	course	,	it	did	n't	matter	.
and	that	's	the	greatest	irony	of	all	when	it	comes	to	the	norden	bombsight	.
the	air	force	's	1.5	billion	dollar	bombsight	was	used	to	drop	its	three	billion	dollar	bomb	,	which	did	n't	need	a	bombsight	at	all	.
meanwhile	,	back	in	new	york	,	no	one	told	carl	norden	that	his	bombsight	was	used	over	hiroshima	.
he	was	a	committed	christian	.
he	thought	he	had	designed	something	that	would	reduce	the	toll	of	suffering	in	war	.
it	would	have	broken	his	heart	.
