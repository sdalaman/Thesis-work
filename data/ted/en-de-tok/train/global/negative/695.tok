once	upon	a	time	,	at	the	age	of	24	,	i	was	a	student	at	st.	john	's	medical	college	in	bangalore	.
i	was	a	guest	student	during	one	month	of	a	public	health	course	.
and	that	changed	my	mindset	forever	.
the	course	was	good	,	but	it	was	not	the	course	content	in	itself	that	changed	the	mindset	.
it	was	the	brutal	realization	,	the	first	morning	,	that	the	indian	students	were	better	than	me	.
you	see	,	i	was	a	study	nerd	.
i	loved	statistics	from	a	young	age	.
and	i	studied	very	much	in	sweden	.
i	used	to	be	in	the	upper	quarter	of	all	courses	i	attended	.
but	in	st.	john	's	,	i	was	in	the	lower	quarter	.
and	the	fact	was	that	indian	students	studied	harder	than	we	did	in	sweden	.
they	read	the	textbook	twice	,	or	three	times	or	four	times	.
in	sweden	we	read	it	once	and	then	we	went	partying	.
and	that	,	to	me	,	that	personal	experience	was	the	first	time	in	my	life	that	the	mindset	i	grew	up	with	was	changed	.
and	i	realized	that	perhaps	the	western	world	will	not	continue	to	dominate	the	world	forever	.
and	i	think	many	of	you	have	the	same	sort	of	personal	experience	.
it	's	that	realization	of	someone	you	meet	that	really	made	you	change	your	ideas	about	the	world	.
it	's	not	the	statistics	,	although	i	tried	to	make	it	funny	.
and	i	will	now	,	here	,	onstage	,	try	to	predict	when	that	will	happen	--	that	asia	will	regain	its	dominant	position	as	the	leading	part	of	the	world	,	as	it	used	to	be	,	over	thousands	of	years	.
and	i	will	do	that	by	trying	to	predict	precisely	at	what	year	the	average	income	per	person	in	india	,	in	china	,	will	reach	that	of	the	west	.
and	i	do	n't	mean	the	whole	economy	,	because	to	grow	an	economy	of	india	to	the	size	of	u.k.	--	that	's	a	piece	of	cake	,	with	one	billion	people	.
but	i	want	to	see	when	will	the	average	pay	,	the	money	for	each	person	,	per	month	,	in	india	and	china	,	when	will	that	have	reached	that	of	u.k.	and	the	united	states	?
but	i	will	start	with	a	historical	background	.
and	you	can	see	my	map	if	i	get	it	up	here	.	you	know	?
i	will	start	at	1858	.
1858	was	a	year	of	great	technological	advancement	in	the	west	.
that	was	the	year	when	queen	victoria	was	able	,	for	the	first	time	,	to	communicate	with	president	buchanan	,	through	the	transatlantic	telegraphic	cable	.
and	they	were	the	first	to	``	twitter	``	transatlantically	.
and	i	've	been	able	,	through	this	wonderful	google	and	internet	,	to	find	the	text	of	the	telegram	sent	back	from	president	buchanan	to	queen	victoria	.
and	it	ends	like	this	:	``	this	telegraph	is	a	fantastic	instrument	to	diffuse	religion	,	civilization	,	liberty	and	law	throughout	the	world	.	``
those	are	nice	words	.	but	i	got	sort	of	curious	of	what	he	meant	with	liberty	,	and	liberty	for	whom	.
and	we	will	think	about	that	when	we	look	at	the	wider	picture	of	the	world	in	1858	.
because	1858	was	also	watershed	year	in	the	history	of	asia	.
1858	was	the	year	when	the	courageous	uprising	against	the	foreign	occupation	of	india	was	defeated	by	the	british	forces	.
and	india	was	up	to	89	years	more	of	foreign	domination	.
1858	in	china	was	the	victory	in	the	opium	war	by	the	british	forces	.
and	that	meant	that	foreigners	,	as	it	said	in	the	treaty	,	were	allowed	to	trade	freely	in	china	.
it	meant	paying	with	opium	for	chinese	goods	.
and	1858	in	japan	was	the	year	when	japan	had	to	sign	the	harris	treaty	and	accept	trade	on	favorable	condition	for	the	u.s	.
and	they	were	threatened	by	those	black	ships	there	,	that	had	been	in	tokyo	harbor	over	the	last	year	.
but	,	japan	,	in	contrast	to	india	and	china	,	maintained	its	national	sovereignty	.
and	let	's	see	how	much	difference	that	can	make	.
and	i	will	do	that	by	bringing	these	bubbles	back	to	a	gapminder	graph	here	,	where	you	can	see	each	bubble	is	a	country	.
the	size	of	the	bubble	here	is	the	population	.
on	this	axis	,	as	i	used	to	have	income	per	person	in	comparable	dollar	.
and	on	that	axis	i	have	life	expectancy	,	the	health	of	people	.
and	i	also	bring	an	innovation	here	.
i	have	transformed	the	laser	beam	into	an	ecological	,	recyclable	version	here	,	in	green	india	.
and	we	will	see	,	you	know	.
look	here	,	1858	,	india	was	here	,	china	was	here	,	japan	was	there	,	united	states	and	united	kingdom	was	richer	over	there	.
and	i	will	start	the	world	like	this	.
india	was	not	always	like	this	level	.
actually	if	we	go	back	into	the	historical	record	,	there	was	a	time	hundreds	of	years	ago	when	the	income	per	person	in	india	and	china	was	even	above	that	of	europe	.
but	1850	had	already	been	many	,	many	years	of	foreign	domination	,	and	india	had	been	de	-	industrialized	.
and	you	can	see	that	the	countries	who	were	growing	their	economy	was	united	states	and	united	kingdom	.
and	they	were	also	,	by	the	end	of	the	century	,	getting	healthy	,	and	japan	was	starting	to	catch	up	.
india	was	trying	down	here	.
can	you	see	how	it	starts	to	move	there	?
but	really	,	really	natural	sovereignty	was	good	for	japan	.
and	japan	is	trying	to	move	up	there	.
and	it	's	the	new	century	now	.	health	is	getting	better	,	united	kingdom	,	united	states	.
but	careful	now	--	we	are	approaching	the	first	world	war	.
and	the	first	world	war	,	you	know	,	we	'll	see	a	lot	of	deaths	and	economical	problems	here	.
united	kingdom	is	going	down	.
and	now	comes	the	spanish	flu	also	.
and	then	after	the	first	world	war	,	they	continue	up	.
still	under	foreign	domination	,	and	without	sovereignty	,	india	and	china	are	down	in	the	corner	.
not	much	has	happened	.
they	have	grown	their	population	but	not	much	more	.
in	the	1930	's	now	,	you	can	see	that	japan	is	going	to	a	period	of	war	,	with	lower	life	expectancy	.
and	the	second	world	war	was	really	a	terrible	event	,	also	economically	for	japan	.
but	they	did	recover	quite	fast	afterwards	.
and	we	are	moving	into	the	new	world	.
in	1947	india	finally	gained	its	independence	.
and	they	could	raise	the	indian	flag	and	become	a	sovereign	nation	,	but	in	very	big	difficulties	down	there	.
in	1949	we	saw	the	emergence	of	the	modern	china	in	a	way	which	surprised	the	world	.
and	what	happened	?
what	happens	in	the	after	independence	?
you	can	see	that	the	health	started	to	improve	.
children	started	to	go	to	school	.
health	services	were	provided	.
this	is	the	great	leap	forward	,	when	china	fell	down	.
it	was	central	planning	by	mao	tse	tung	.
china	recovered	.	then	they	said	,	``	nevermore	,	stupid	central	planning	.	``
but	they	went	up	here	,	and	india	was	trying	to	follow	.
and	they	were	catching	up	indeed	.
and	both	countries	had	the	better	health	,	but	still	a	very	low	economy	.
and	we	came	to	1978	,	and	mao	tse	tung	died	,	and	a	new	guy	turned	up	from	the	left	.
and	it	was	deng	xiaoping	coming	out	here	.
and	he	said	,	``	does	n't	matter	if	a	cat	is	white	or	black	,	as	long	as	it	catches	mice	.	``
because	catching	mice	is	what	the	two	cats	wanted	to	do	.
and	you	can	see	the	two	cats	being	here	,	china	and	india	,	wanting	to	catch	the	mices	over	there	,	you	know	.
and	they	decided	to	go	not	only	for	health	and	education	,	but	also	starting	to	grow	their	economy	.
and	the	market	reformer	was	successful	there	.
in	'92	india	follows	with	a	market	reform	.
and	they	go	quite	closely	together	,	and	you	can	see	that	the	similarity	with	india	and	china	,	in	many	ways	,	are	greater	than	the	differences	with	them	.
and	here	they	march	on	.	and	will	they	catch	up	?
this	is	the	big	question	today	.
there	they	are	today	.
now	what	does	it	mean	that	the	--	the	averages	there	--	this	is	the	average	of	china	.
if	i	would	split	china	,	look	here	,	shanghai	has	already	catched	up	.
shanghai	is	already	there	.
and	it	's	healthier	than	the	united	states	.
but	on	the	other	hand	,	guizhou	,	one	of	the	poorest	inland	provinces	of	china	,	is	there	.
and	if	i	split	guizhou	into	urban	and	rural	,	the	rural	part	of	guizhou	goes	down	there	.
you	see	this	enormous	inequity	in	china	,	in	the	midst	of	fast	economic	growth	.
and	if	i	would	also	look	at	india	,	you	have	another	type	of	inequity	,	actually	,	in	india	.
the	geographical	,	macro	-	geographical	difference	is	not	so	big	.
uttar	pradesh	,	the	biggest	of	the	states	here	,	is	poorer	and	has	a	lower	health	than	the	rest	of	india	.
kerala	is	flying	on	top	there	,	matching	united	states	in	health	,	but	not	in	economy	.
and	here	,	maharashtra	,	with	mumbai	,	is	forging	forward	.
now	in	india	,	the	big	inequities	are	within	the	state	,	rather	than	between	the	states	.
and	that	is	not	a	bad	thing	,	in	itself	.
if	you	have	a	lot	inequity	,	macro	-	geographical	inequities	can	be	more	difficult	in	the	long	term	to	deal	with	,	than	if	it	is	in	the	same	area	where	you	have	a	growth	center	relatively	close	to	where	poor	people	are	living	.
no	,	there	is	one	more	inequity	.	look	there	,	united	states	.
oh	,	they	broke	my	frame	.
washington	,	d.c.	went	out	here	.
my	friends	at	gapminder	wanted	me	to	show	this	because	there	is	a	new	leader	in	washington	who	is	really	concerned	about	the	health	system	.
and	i	can	understand	him	,	because	washington	,	d.c	.
is	so	rich	over	there	but	they	are	not	as	healthy	as	kerala	.
it	's	quite	interesting	,	is	n't	it	?
i	can	see	a	business	opportunity	for	kerala	,	helping	fix	the	health	system	in	the	united	states	.
now	here	we	have	the	whole	world	.	you	have	the	legend	down	there	.
and	when	you	see	the	two	giant	cats	here	,	pushing	forward	,	you	see	that	in	between	them	and	ahead	of	them	,	is	the	whole	emerging	economies	of	the	world	,	which	thomas	friedman	so	correctly	called	the	``	flat	world	.	``
you	can	see	that	in	health	and	education	,	a	large	part	of	the	world	population	is	putting	forward	,	but	in	africa	,	and	other	parts	,	as	in	rural	guizhou	in	china	,	there	is	still	people	with	low	health	and	very	low	economy	.
we	have	an	enormous	disparity	in	the	world	.
but	most	of	the	world	in	the	middle	are	pushing	forwards	very	fast	.
now	,	back	to	my	projections	.
when	will	it	catch	up	?	i	have	to	go	back	to	very	conventional	graph	.
i	will	show	income	per	person	on	this	axis	instead	,	poor	down	here	,	rich	up	there	.
and	then	time	here	,	from	1858	i	start	the	world	.
and	we	shall	see	what	will	happen	with	these	countries	.
you	see	,	china	under	foreign	domination	actually	lowered	their	income	and	came	down	to	the	indian	level	here	.
whereas	u.k.	and	united	states	is	getting	richer	and	richer	.
and	after	second	world	war	,	united	states	is	richer	than	u.k	.
but	independence	is	coming	here	.
growth	is	starting	,	economic	reform	.
growth	is	faster	,	and	with	projection	from	imf	you	can	see	where	you	expect	them	to	be	in	2014	.
now	,	the	question	is	,	``	when	will	the	catch	up	take	place	?	``
look	at	,	look	at	the	united	states	.
can	you	see	the	bubble	?
the	bubbles	,	not	my	bubbles	,	but	the	financial	bubbles	.
that	's	the	dot	com	bubble	.	this	is	the	lehman	brothers	doorstep	there	.
you	see	it	came	down	there	.
and	it	seems	this	is	another	rock	coming	down	there	,	you	know	.
so	they	does	n't	seem	to	go	this	way	,	these	countries	.
they	seem	to	go	in	a	more	humble	growth	way	,	you	know	.
and	people	interested	in	growth	are	turning	their	eyes	towards	asia	.
i	can	compare	to	japan	.	this	is	japan	coming	up	.
you	see	,	japan	did	it	like	that	.
we	add	japan	to	it	.
and	there	is	no	doubt	that	fast	catch	up	can	take	place	.
can	you	see	here	what	japan	did	?
japan	did	it	like	this	,	until	full	catch	up	,	and	then	they	follow	with	the	other	high	-	income	economies	.
but	the	real	projections	for	those	ones	,	i	would	like	to	give	it	like	this	.
can	be	worse	,	can	be	better	.
it	's	always	difficult	to	predict	,	especially	about	the	future	.
now	,	a	historian	tells	me	it	's	even	more	difficult	to	predict	about	the	past	.
i	think	i	'm	in	a	difficult	position	here	.
inequalities	in	china	and	india	i	consider	really	the	big	obstacle	because	to	bring	the	entire	population	into	growth	and	prosperity	is	what	will	create	a	domestic	market	,	what	will	avoid	social	instability	,	and	which	will	make	use	of	the	entire	capacity	of	the	population	.
so	,	social	investments	in	health	,	education	and	infrastructure	,	and	electricity	is	really	what	is	needed	in	india	and	china	.
you	know	the	climate	.	we	have	great	international	experts	within	india	telling	us	that	the	climate	is	changing	,	and	actions	has	to	be	taken	,	otherwise	china	and	india	would	be	the	countries	most	to	suffer	from	climate	change	.
and	i	consider	india	and	china	the	best	partners	in	the	world	in	a	good	global	climate	policy	.
but	they	ai	n't	going	to	pay	for	what	others	,	who	have	more	money	,	have	largely	created	,	and	i	can	agree	on	that	.
but	what	i	'm	really	worried	about	is	war	.
will	the	former	rich	countries	really	accept	a	completely	changed	world	economy	,	and	a	shift	of	power	away	from	where	it	has	been	the	last	50	to	100	to	150	years	,	back	to	asia	?
and	will	asia	be	able	to	handle	that	new	position	of	being	in	charge	of	being	the	most	mighty	,	and	the	governors	of	the	world	?
so	,	always	avoid	war	,	because	that	always	pushes	human	beings	backward	.
now	if	these	inequalities	,	climate	and	war	can	be	avoided	,	get	ready	for	a	world	in	equity	,	because	this	is	what	seems	to	be	happening	.
and	that	vision	that	i	got	as	a	young	student	,	1972	,	that	indians	can	be	much	better	than	swedes	,	is	just	about	to	happen	.
and	it	will	happen	precisely	the	year	2048	in	the	later	part	of	the	summer	,	in	july	,	more	precisely	,	the	27th	of	july	.
the	27th	of	july	,	2048	is	my	100th	birthday	.
and	i	expect	to	speak	in	the	first	session	of	the	39th	ted	india	.
get	your	bookings	in	time	.	thank	you	very	much	.
