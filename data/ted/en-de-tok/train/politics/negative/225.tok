by	day	,	i	'm	a	venture	capitalist	.	on	weekends	,	i	love	rockets	.
i	love	photography	,	i	love	rockets	,	and	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	a	hobby	that	can	scale	and	show	you	some	photos	that	i	've	taken	over	the	years	with	kids	like	these	;	kids	that	hopefully	will	grow	up	to	love	rocketry	and	eventually	become	maybe	another	richard	branson	or	diamandis	.
my	son	designed	a	rocket	that	became	stable	,	a	golf	ball	rocket	--	i	thought	it	was	quite	an	interesting	experiment	in	the	principles	of	rocket	science	--	and	it	flies	straight	as	an	arrow	.
baking	soda	and	vinegar	.
night	shots	are	beautiful	,	piercing	the	big	dipper	and	the	milky	way	.
two	stage	rockets	,	rockets	with	video	cameras	on	them	,	on	-	board	computers	logging	their	flights	,	rocket	gliders	that	fly	back	to	earth	.
i	use	rocksim	to	simulate	flights	before	they	go	to	see	if	they	'll	break	supersonic	or	not	,	and	then	fly	them	with	on	-	board	computers	to	verify	their	performance	.
but	to	launch	the	really	big	stuff	,	you	go	to	the	middle	of	nowhere	:	black	rock	desert	,	where	dangerous	things	happen	.
and	the	boys	get	bigger	,	and	the	rockets	get	bigger	.
and	they	use	motors	that	literally	are	used	on	cruise	missile	boosters	.
they	rumble	the	belly	and	leave	even	photographers	in	awe	watching	the	spectacle	.
these	rockets	use	experimental	motors	like	nitrous	oxide	.
they	use	solid	propellant	most	frequently	.
it	's	a	strange	kind	of	love	.
we	have	a	rocketmavericks.com	website	with	my	photos	if	you	want	to	learn	more	about	this	,	participate	,	be	a	spectator	.
mavericks	:	we	had	to	call	it	rocket	mavericks	.
this	one	was	great	:	it	went	to	100,000	feet	,	but	did	n't	quite	.	actually	,	it	went	11	feet	into	the	solid	clay	;	and	it	became	a	bunker	-	buster	,	drilling	down	into	the	clay	.	it	had	to	be	dug	out	.
rockets	often	spiral	out	of	control	if	you	put	too	much	propellant	in	them	.
here	was	a	drag	race	.
at	night	you	can	see	what	happened	in	a	second	;	in	daytime	,	we	call	them	land	sharks	.
sometimes	they	just	explode	before	your	eyes	or	come	down	supersonic	.
to	take	this	shot	,	i	do	what	i	often	do	,	which	is	go	way	beyond	the	pads	where	none	of	the	other	spectators	are	.
and	if	we	can	run	the	video	,	i	'll	show	you	what	it	took	to	get	this	dreamworks	shot	.
voices	:	woohoo	!	yeah	.	nice	.
steve	jurvetson	:	this	is	rare	.	here	's	where	they	realized	the	computer	's	failed	.
they	're	yelling	deploy	.	voices	:	oh	shit	.
sj	:	this	is	when	they	realize	everything	on	board	's	gone	haywire	.
voices	:	it	's	going	ballistic	.	oh	shit	.
sj	:	and	i	'll	just	be	quiet	.
voices	:	no	.
up	,	up	,	up	.
sj	:	and	that	's	me	over	there	,	taking	photos	the	whole	way	.
things	often	go	wrong	.
some	people	watch	this	event	because	of	a	nascar	-	like	fascination	with	things	bumping	and	grinding	.	burning	the	parachute	as	it	fell	--	that	was	last	weekend	.
this	guy	went	up	,	went	supersonic	,	ripped	the	fin	can	off	--	yard	sale	in	the	sky	--	and	a	burning	metal	hunk	coming	back	.
these	things	would	drop	down	from	above	all	through	the	weekend	of	rocket	launch	after	rocket	launch	after	rocket	launch	.
it	's	a	cadence	you	ca	n't	quite	imagine	.
and	in	many	ways	,	i	try	to	capture	the	mishaps	;	it	's	the	challenge	in	photography	when	these	things	all	take	place	in	a	fraction	of	a	second	.
why	do	they	do	it	?	it	's	for	things	like	this	:	gene	from	alabama	drives	out	there	with	this	rocket	that	he	's	built	with	x	-	ray	sensors	,	video	cameras	,	festooned	with	electronics	,	and	he	succeeds	getting	to	100,000	feet	,	leaving	the	atmosphere	,	seeing	a	thin	blue	line	of	space	.
it	is	this	breathtaking	image	--	success	,	of	course	--	that	motivates	us	and	motivates	kids	to	follow	and	understand	rocket	science	:	to	understand	the	importance	of	physics	and	math	and	,	in	many	ways	,	to	sort	of	have	that	awe	at	exploration	of	the	frontiers	of	the	unknown	.
thank	you	.
