so	it	was	about	four	years	ago	,	five	years	ago	,	i	was	sitting	on	a	stage	in	philadelphia	,	i	think	it	was	,	with	a	bag	similar	to	this	.
and	i	was	pulling	a	molecule	out	of	this	bag	.
and	i	was	saying	,	you	do	n't	know	this	molecule	really	well	,	but	your	body	knows	it	extremely	well	.
and	i	was	thinking	that	your	body	hated	it	,	at	the	time	,	because	we	are	very	immune	to	this	.	this	is	called	alpha	-	gal	epitope	.
and	the	fact	that	pig	heart	valves	have	lots	of	these	on	them	is	the	reason	that	you	ca	n't	transplant	a	pig	heart	valve	into	a	person	easily	.
actually	our	body	does	n't	hate	these	.
our	body	loves	these	.	it	eats	them	.
i	mean	,	the	cells	in	our	immune	system	are	always	hungry	.
and	if	an	antibody	is	stuck	to	one	of	these	things	on	the	cell	,	it	means	``	that	's	food	.	``
now	,	i	was	thinking	about	that	and	i	said	,	you	know	,	we	've	got	this	immune	response	to	this	ridiculous	molecule	that	we	do	n't	make	,	and	we	see	it	a	lot	in	other	animals	and	stuff	.
but	i	said	we	ca	n't	get	rid	of	it	,	because	all	the	people	who	tried	to	transplant	heart	valves	found	out	you	ca	n't	get	rid	of	that	immunity	.
and	i	said	,	why	do	n't	you	use	that	?
what	if	i	could	stick	this	molecule	,	slap	it	onto	a	bacteria	that	was	pathogenic	to	me	,	that	had	just	invaded	my	lungs	?
i	mean	i	could	immediately	tap	into	an	immune	response	that	was	already	there	,	where	it	was	not	going	to	take	five	or	six	days	to	develop	it	--	it	was	going	to	immediately	attack	whatever	this	thing	was	on	.
it	was	kind	of	like	the	same	thing	that	happens	when	you	,	like	when	you	're	getting	stopped	for	a	traffic	ticket	in	l.a.	,	and	the	cop	drops	a	bag	of	marijuana	in	the	back	of	your	car	,	and	then	charges	you	for	possession	of	marijuana	.
it	's	like	this	very	fast	,	very	efficient	way	to	get	people	off	the	street	.
so	you	can	take	a	bacteria	that	really	does	n't	make	these	things	at	all	,	and	if	you	could	clamp	these	on	it	really	well	you	have	it	taken	off	the	street	.
and	for	certain	bacteria	we	do	n't	have	really	efficient	ways	to	do	that	anymore	.
our	antibiotics	are	running	out	.
and	,	i	mean	,	the	world	apparently	is	running	out	too	.
so	probably	it	does	n't	matter	50	years	from	now	--	streptococcus	and	stuff	like	that	will	be	rampant	--	because	we	wo	n't	be	here	.	but	if	we	are	--	we	're	going	to	need	something	to	do	with	the	bacteria	.
so	i	started	working	with	this	thing	,	with	a	bunch	of	collaborators	.
and	trying	to	attach	this	to	things	that	were	themselves	attached	to	certain	specific	target	zones	,	bacteria	that	we	do	n't	like	.
and	i	feel	now	like	george	bush	.
it	's	like	``	mission	accomplished	.	``
so	i	might	be	doing	something	dumb	,	just	like	he	was	doing	at	the	time	.
but	basically	what	i	was	talking	about	there	we	've	now	gotten	to	work	.
and	it	's	killing	bacteria	.	it	's	eating	them	.
this	thing	can	be	stuck	,	like	that	little	green	triangle	up	there	,	sort	of	symbolizing	this	right	now	.
you	can	stick	this	to	something	called	a	dna	aptamer	.
and	that	dna	aptamer	will	attach	specifically	to	a	target	that	you	have	selected	for	it	.
so	you	can	find	a	little	feature	on	a	bacterium	that	you	do	n't	like	,	like	staphylococcus	--	i	do	n't	like	it	in	particular	,	because	it	killed	a	professor	friend	of	mine	last	year	.
it	does	n't	respond	to	antibiotics	.	so	i	do	n't	like	it	.
and	i	'm	making	an	aptamer	that	will	have	this	attached	to	it	.
that	will	know	how	to	find	staph	when	it	's	in	your	body	,	and	will	alert	your	immune	system	to	go	after	it	.
here	's	what	happened	.	see	that	line	on	the	very	top	with	the	little	dots	?
that	's	a	bunch	of	mice	that	had	been	poisoned	by	our	scientist	friends	down	in	texas	,	at	brooks	air	base	,	with	anthrax	.
and	they	had	also	been	treated	with	a	drug	that	we	made	that	would	attack	anthrax	in	particular	,	and	direct	your	immune	system	to	it	.
you	'll	notice	they	all	lived	,	the	ones	on	the	top	line	--	that	's	a	100	percent	survival	rate	.
and	they	actually	lived	another	14	days	,	or	28	when	we	finally	killed	them	,	and	took	them	apart	and	figured	out	what	went	wrong	.
why	did	they	not	die	?
and	they	did	n't	die	because	they	did	n't	have	anthrax	anymore	.
so	we	did	it	.	okay	?
mission	accomplished	!
