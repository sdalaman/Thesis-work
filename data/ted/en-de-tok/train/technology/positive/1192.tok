i	love	the	internet	.
it	's	true	.
think	about	everything	it	has	brought	us	.
think	about	all	the	services	we	use	,	all	the	connectivity	,	all	the	entertainment	,	all	the	business	,	all	the	commerce	.
and	it	's	happening	during	our	lifetimes	.
i	'm	pretty	sure	that	one	day	we	'll	be	writing	history	books	hundreds	of	years	from	now	.	this	time	our	generation	will	be	remembered	as	the	generation	that	got	online	,	the	generation	that	built	something	really	and	truly	global	.
but	yes	,	it	's	also	true	that	the	internet	has	problems	,	very	serious	problems	,	problems	with	security	and	problems	with	privacy	.
i	've	spent	my	career	fighting	these	problems	.
so	let	me	show	you	something	.
this	here	is	brain	.
this	is	a	floppy	disk	--	five	and	a	quarter	-	inch	floppy	disk	infected	by	brain	.	a	.
it	's	the	first	virus	we	ever	found	for	pc	computers	.
and	we	actually	know	where	brain	came	from	.
we	know	because	it	says	so	inside	the	code	.
let	's	take	a	look	.
all	right	.
that	's	the	boot	sector	of	an	infected	floppy	,	and	if	we	take	a	closer	look	inside	,	we	'll	see	that	right	there	,	it	says	,	``	welcome	to	the	dungeon	.	``
and	then	it	continues	,	saying	,	1986	,	basit	and	amjad	.
and	basit	and	amjad	are	first	names	,	pakistani	first	names	.
in	fact	,	there	's	a	phone	number	and	an	address	in	pakistan	.
now	,	1986	.
now	it	's	2011	.
that	's	25	years	ago	.
the	pc	virus	problem	is	25	years	old	now	.
so	half	a	year	ago	,	i	decided	to	go	to	pakistan	myself	.
so	let	's	see	,	here	's	a	couple	of	photos	i	took	while	i	was	in	pakistan	.
this	is	from	the	city	of	lahore	,	which	is	around	300	kilometers	south	from	abbottabad	,	where	bin	laden	was	caught	.
here	's	a	typical	street	view	.
and	here	's	the	street	or	road	leading	to	this	building	,	which	is	730	nizam	block	at	allama	iqbal	town	.
and	i	knocked	on	the	door	.
you	want	to	guess	who	opened	the	door	?
basit	and	amjad	;	they	are	still	there	.
so	here	standing	up	is	basit	.
sitting	down	is	his	brother	amjad	.
these	are	the	guys	who	wrote	the	first	pc	virus	.
now	of	course	,	we	had	a	very	interesting	discussion	.
i	asked	them	why	.
i	asked	them	how	they	feel	about	what	they	started	.
and	i	got	some	sort	of	satisfaction	from	learning	that	both	basit	and	amjad	had	had	their	computers	infected	dozens	of	times	by	completely	unrelated	other	viruses	over	these	years	.
so	there	is	some	sort	of	justice	in	the	world	after	all	.
now	,	the	viruses	that	we	used	to	see	in	the	1980s	and	1990s	obviously	are	not	a	problem	any	more	.
so	let	me	just	show	you	a	couple	of	examples	of	what	they	used	to	look	like	.
what	i	'm	running	here	is	a	system	that	enables	me	to	run	age	-	old	programs	on	a	modern	computer	.
so	let	me	just	mount	some	drives	.	go	over	there	.
what	we	have	here	is	a	list	of	old	viruses	.
so	let	me	just	run	some	viruses	on	my	computer	.
for	example	,	let	's	go	with	the	centipede	virus	first	.
and	you	can	see	at	the	top	of	the	screen	,	there	's	a	centipede	scrolling	across	your	computer	when	you	get	infected	by	this	one	.
you	know	that	you	're	infected	because	it	actually	shows	up	.
here	's	another	one	.	this	is	the	virus	called	crash	,	invented	in	russia	in	1992	.
let	me	show	you	one	which	actually	makes	some	sound	.
and	the	last	example	,	guess	what	the	walker	virus	does	?
yes	,	there	's	a	guy	walking	across	your	screen	once	you	get	infected	.
so	it	used	to	be	fairly	easy	to	know	that	you	're	infected	by	a	virus	,	when	the	viruses	were	written	by	hobbyists	and	teenagers	.
today	,	they	are	no	longer	being	written	by	hobbyists	and	teenagers	.
today	,	viruses	are	a	global	problem	.
what	we	have	here	in	the	background	is	an	example	of	our	systems	that	we	run	in	our	labs	,	where	we	track	virus	infections	worldwide	.
so	we	can	actually	see	in	real	time	that	we	've	just	blocked	viruses	in	sweden	and	taiwan	and	russia	and	elsewhere	.
in	fact	,	if	i	just	connect	back	to	our	lab	systems	through	the	web	,	we	can	see	in	real	time	just	some	kind	of	idea	of	how	many	viruses	,	how	many	new	examples	of	malware	we	find	every	single	day	.
here	's	the	latest	virus	we	've	found	,	in	a	file	called	server	.	exe	.
and	we	found	it	right	over	here	three	seconds	ago	--	the	previous	one	,	six	seconds	ago	.
and	if	we	just	scroll	around	,	it	's	just	massive	.
we	find	tens	of	thousands	,	even	hundreds	of	thousands	.
and	that	's	the	last	20	minutes	of	malware	every	single	day	.
so	where	are	all	these	coming	from	then	?
well	today	,	it	's	the	organized	criminal	gangs	writing	these	viruses	because	they	make	money	with	their	viruses	.
it	's	gangs	like	--	let	's	go	to	gangstabucks.com	.
this	is	a	website	operating	in	moscow	where	these	guys	are	buying	infected	computers	.
so	if	you	are	a	virus	writer	and	you	're	capable	of	infecting	windows	computers	,	but	you	do	n't	know	what	to	do	with	them	,	you	can	sell	those	infected	computers	--	somebody	else	's	computers	--	to	these	guys	.
and	they	'll	actually	pay	you	money	for	those	computers	.
so	how	do	these	guys	then	monetize	those	infected	computers	?
well	there	's	multiple	different	ways	,	such	as	banking	trojans	,	which	will	steal	money	from	your	online	banking	accounts	when	you	do	online	banking	,	or	keyloggers	.
keyloggers	silently	sit	on	your	computer	,	hidden	from	view	,	and	they	record	everything	you	type	.
so	you	're	sitting	on	your	computer	and	you	're	doing	google	searches	.
every	single	google	search	you	type	is	saved	and	sent	to	the	criminals	.
every	single	email	you	write	is	saved	and	sent	to	the	criminals	.
same	thing	with	every	single	password	and	so	on	.
but	the	thing	that	they	're	actually	looking	for	most	are	sessions	where	you	go	online	and	do	online	purchases	in	any	online	store	.
because	when	you	do	purchases	in	online	stores	,	you	will	be	typing	in	your	name	,	the	delivery	address	,	your	credit	card	number	and	the	credit	card	security	codes	.
and	here	's	an	example	of	a	file	we	found	from	a	server	a	couple	of	weeks	ago	.
that	's	the	credit	card	number	,	that	's	the	expiration	date	,	that	's	the	security	code	,	and	that	's	the	name	of	the	owner	of	the	card	.
once	you	gain	access	to	other	people	's	credit	card	information	,	you	can	just	go	online	and	buy	whatever	you	want	with	this	information	.
and	that	,	obviously	,	is	a	problem	.
we	now	have	a	whole	underground	marketplace	and	business	ecosystem	built	around	online	crime	.
one	example	of	how	these	guys	actually	are	capable	of	monetizing	their	operations	:	we	go	and	have	a	look	at	the	pages	of	interpol	and	search	for	wanted	persons	.
we	find	guys	like	bjorn	sundin	,	originally	from	sweden	,	and	his	partner	in	crime	,	also	listed	on	the	interpol	wanted	pages	,	mr.	shaileshkumar	jain	,	a	u.s.	citizen	.
these	guys	were	running	an	operation	called	i.m.u	.	,	a	cybercrime	operation	through	which	they	netted	millions	.
they	are	both	right	now	on	the	run	.
nobody	knows	where	they	are	.
u.s.	officials	,	just	a	couple	of	weeks	ago	,	froze	a	swiss	bank	account	belonging	to	mr.	jain	,	and	that	bank	account	had	14.9	million	u.s.	dollars	on	it	.
so	the	amount	of	money	online	crime	generates	is	significant	.
and	that	means	that	the	online	criminals	can	actually	afford	to	invest	into	their	attacks	.
we	know	that	online	criminals	are	hiring	programmers	,	hiring	testing	people	,	testing	their	code	,	having	back	-	end	systems	with	sql	databases	.
and	they	can	afford	to	watch	how	we	work	--	like	how	security	people	work	--	and	try	to	work	their	way	around	any	security	precautions	we	can	build	.
they	also	use	the	global	nature	of	internet	to	their	advantage	.
i	mean	,	the	internet	is	international	.
that	's	why	we	call	it	the	internet	.
and	if	you	just	go	and	take	a	look	at	what	's	happening	in	the	online	world	,	here	's	a	video	built	by	clarified	networks	,	which	illustrates	how	one	single	malware	family	is	able	to	move	around	the	world	.
this	operation	,	believed	to	be	originally	from	estonia	,	moves	around	from	one	country	to	another	as	soon	as	the	website	is	tried	to	shut	down	.
so	you	just	ca	n't	shut	these	guys	down	.
they	will	switch	from	one	country	to	another	,	from	one	jurisdiction	to	another	--	moving	around	the	world	,	using	the	fact	that	we	do	n't	have	the	capability	to	globally	police	operations	like	this	.
so	the	internet	is	as	if	someone	would	have	given	free	plane	tickets	to	all	the	online	criminals	of	the	world	.
now	,	criminals	who	were	n't	capable	of	reaching	us	before	can	reach	us	.
so	how	do	you	actually	go	around	finding	online	criminals	?
how	do	you	actually	track	them	down	?
let	me	give	you	an	example	.
what	we	have	here	is	one	exploit	file	.
here	,	i	'm	looking	at	the	hex	dump	of	an	image	file	,	which	contains	an	exploit	.
and	that	basically	means	,	if	you	're	trying	to	view	this	image	file	on	your	windows	computer	,	it	actually	takes	over	your	computer	and	runs	code	.
now	,	if	you	'll	take	a	look	at	this	image	file	--	well	there	's	the	image	header	,	and	there	the	actual	code	of	the	attack	starts	.
and	that	code	has	been	encrypted	,	so	let	's	decrypt	it	.
it	has	been	encrypted	with	xor	function	97	.
you	just	have	to	believe	me	,	it	is	,	it	is	.
and	we	can	go	here	and	actually	start	decrypting	it	.
well	the	yellow	part	of	the	code	is	now	decrypted	.
and	i	know	,	it	does	n't	really	look	much	different	from	the	original	.
but	just	keep	staring	at	it	.
you	'll	actually	see	that	down	here	you	can	see	a	web	address	:	unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe	and	when	you	view	this	image	on	your	computer	it	actually	is	going	to	download	and	run	that	program	.
and	that	's	a	backdoor	which	will	take	over	your	computer	.
but	even	more	interestingly	,	if	we	continue	decrypting	,	we	'll	find	this	mysterious	string	,	which	says	o	600ko78rus	.
that	code	is	there	underneath	the	encryption	as	some	sort	of	a	signature	.
it	's	not	used	for	anything	.
and	i	was	looking	at	that	,	trying	to	figure	out	what	it	means	.
so	obviously	i	googled	for	it	.
i	got	zero	hits	;	was	n't	there	.
so	i	spoke	with	the	guys	at	the	lab	.
and	we	have	a	couple	of	russian	guys	in	our	labs	,	and	one	of	them	mentioned	,	well	,	it	ends	in	rus	like	russia	.
and	78	is	the	city	code	for	the	city	of	st.	petersburg	.
for	example	,	you	can	find	it	from	some	phone	numbers	and	car	license	plates	and	stuff	like	that	.
so	i	went	looking	for	contacts	in	st.	petersburg	,	and	through	a	long	road	,	we	eventually	found	this	one	particular	website	.
here	's	this	russian	guy	who	's	been	operating	online	for	a	number	of	years	who	runs	his	own	website	,	and	he	runs	a	blog	under	the	popular	live	journal	.
and	on	this	blog	,	he	blogs	about	his	life	,	about	his	life	in	st.	petersburg	--	he	's	in	his	early	20s	--	about	his	cat	,	about	his	girlfriend	.
and	he	drives	a	very	nice	car	.
in	fact	,	this	guy	drives	a	mercedes	-	benz	s	600	v	12	with	a	six	-	liter	engine	with	more	than	400	horsepower	.
now	that	's	a	nice	car	for	a	20	-	something	year	-	old	kid	in	st.	petersburg	.
how	do	i	know	about	this	car	?
because	he	blogged	about	the	car	.
he	actually	had	a	car	accident	.
in	downtown	st.	petersburg	,	he	actually	crashed	his	car	into	another	car	.
and	he	put	blogged	images	about	the	car	accident	--	that	's	his	mercedes	--	right	here	is	the	lada	samara	he	crashed	into	.
and	you	can	actually	see	that	the	license	plate	of	the	samara	ends	in	78rus	.
and	if	you	actually	take	a	look	at	the	scene	picture	,	you	can	see	that	the	plate	of	the	mercedes	is	o	600ko78rus	.
now	i	'm	not	a	lawyer	,	but	if	i	would	be	,	this	is	where	i	would	say	,	``	i	rest	my	case	.	``
so	what	happens	when	online	criminals	are	caught	?
well	in	most	cases	it	never	gets	this	far	.
the	vast	majority	of	the	online	crime	cases	,	we	do	n't	even	know	which	continent	the	attacks	are	coming	from	.
and	even	if	we	are	able	to	find	online	criminals	,	quite	often	there	is	no	outcome	.
the	local	police	do	n't	act	,	or	if	they	do	,	there	's	not	enough	evidence	,	or	for	some	reason	we	ca	n't	take	them	down	.
i	wish	it	would	be	easier	;	unfortunately	it	is	n't	.
but	things	are	also	changing	at	a	very	rapid	pace	.
you	've	all	heard	about	things	like	stuxnet	.
so	if	you	look	at	what	stuxnet	did	is	that	it	infected	these	.
that	's	a	siemens	s	7-400	plc	,	programmable	logic	[	controller	]	.
and	this	is	what	runs	our	infrastructure	.
this	is	what	runs	everything	around	us	.
plc	's	,	these	small	boxes	which	have	no	display	,	no	keyboard	,	which	are	programmed	,	are	put	in	place	,	and	they	do	their	job	.
for	example	,	the	elevators	in	this	building	most	likely	are	controlled	by	one	of	these	.
and	when	stuxnet	infects	one	of	these	,	that	's	a	massive	revolution	on	the	kinds	of	risks	we	have	to	worry	about	.
because	everything	around	us	is	being	run	by	these	.
i	mean	,	we	have	critical	infrastructure	.
you	go	to	any	factory	,	any	power	plant	,	any	chemical	plant	,	any	food	processing	plant	,	you	look	around	--	everything	is	being	run	by	computers	.
everything	is	being	run	by	computers	.
everything	is	reliant	on	these	computers	working	.
we	have	become	very	reliant	on	internet	,	on	basic	things	like	electricity	,	obviously	,	on	computers	working	.
and	this	really	is	something	which	creates	completely	new	problems	for	us	.
we	must	have	some	way	of	continuing	to	work	even	if	computers	fail	.
so	preparedness	means	that	we	can	do	stuff	even	when	the	things	we	take	for	granted	are	n't	there	.
it	's	actually	very	basic	stuff	--	thinking	about	continuity	,	thinking	about	backups	,	thinking	about	the	things	that	actually	matter	.
now	i	told	you	--	i	love	the	internet	.	i	do	.
think	about	all	the	services	we	have	online	.
think	about	if	they	are	taken	away	from	you	,	if	one	day	you	do	n't	actually	have	them	for	some	reason	or	another	.
i	see	beauty	in	the	future	of	the	internet	,	but	i	'm	worried	that	we	might	not	see	that	.
i	'm	worried	that	we	are	running	into	problems	because	of	online	crime	.
online	crime	is	the	one	thing	that	might	take	these	things	away	from	us	.
i	've	spent	my	life	defending	the	net	,	and	i	do	feel	that	if	we	do	n't	fight	online	crime	,	we	are	running	a	risk	of	losing	it	all	.
we	have	to	do	this	globally	,	and	we	have	to	do	it	right	now	.
what	we	need	is	more	global	,	international	law	enforcement	work	to	find	online	criminal	gangs	--	these	organized	gangs	that	are	making	millions	out	of	their	attacks	.
that	's	much	more	important	than	running	anti	-	viruses	or	running	firewalls	.
what	actually	matters	is	actually	finding	the	people	behind	these	attacks	,	and	even	more	importantly	,	we	have	to	find	the	people	who	are	about	to	become	part	of	this	online	world	of	crime	,	but	have	n't	yet	done	it	.
we	have	to	find	the	people	with	the	skills	,	but	without	the	opportunities	and	give	them	the	opportunities	to	use	their	skills	for	good	.
thank	you	very	much	.
