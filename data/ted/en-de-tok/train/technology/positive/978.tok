i	learned	about	the	haiti	earthquake	by	skype	.
my	wife	sent	me	a	message	,	``	whoa	,	earthquake	,	``	and	then	disappeared	for	25	minutes	.
it	was	25	minutes	of	absolute	terror	that	thousands	of	people	across	the	u.s.	felt	.
i	was	afraid	of	a	tsunami	;	what	i	did	n't	realize	was	there	was	a	greater	terror	in	haiti	,	and	that	was	building	collapse	.
we	've	all	seen	the	photos	of	the	collapsed	buildings	in	haiti	.
these	are	shots	my	wife	took	a	couple	days	after	the	quake	,	while	i	was	making	my	way	through	the	d.r	.	into	the	country	.
this	is	the	national	palace	--	the	equivalent	of	the	white	house	.
this	is	the	largest	supermarket	in	the	caribbean	at	peak	shopping	time	.
this	is	a	nurses	'	college	--	there	are	300	nurses	studying	.
the	general	hospital	right	next	door	emerged	largely	unscathed	.
this	is	the	ministry	of	economics	and	finance	.
we	have	all	heard	about	the	tremendous	human	loss	in	the	earthquake	in	haiti	,	but	we	have	n't	heard	enough	about	why	all	those	lives	were	lost	.
we	have	n't	heard	about	why	the	buildings	failed	.
after	all	,	it	was	the	buildings	,	not	the	earthquake	,	that	killed	220,000	people	,	that	injured	330,000	,	that	displaced	1.3	million	people	,	that	cut	off	food	and	water	and	supplies	for	an	entire	nation	.
this	is	the	largest	metropolitan	-	area	disaster	in	decades	,	and	it	was	not	a	natural	disaster	--	it	was	a	disaster	of	engineering	.
aidg	has	worked	in	haiti	since	2007	,	providing	engineering	and	business	support	to	small	businesses	.
and	after	the	quake	,	we	started	bringing	in	earthquake	engineers	to	figure	out	why	the	buildings	collapsed	,	to	examine	what	was	safe	and	what	was	n't	.
working	with	minustah	,	which	is	the	u.n.	mission	in	haiti	,	with	the	ministry	of	public	works	,	with	different	ngos	,	we	inspected	over	1,500	buildings	.
we	inspected	schools	and	private	residencies	.
we	inspected	medical	centers	and	food	warehouses	.
we	inspected	government	buildings	.
this	is	the	ministry	of	justice	.
behind	that	door	is	the	national	judicial	archives	.
the	fellow	in	the	door	,	andre	filitrault	--	who	's	the	director	of	the	center	for	interdisciplinary	earthquake	engineering	research	at	the	university	of	buffalo	--	was	examining	it	to	see	if	it	was	safe	to	recover	the	archives	.
andre	told	me	,	after	seeing	these	buildings	fail	again	and	again	in	the	same	way	,	that	there	is	no	new	research	here	.
there	is	nothing	here	that	we	do	n't	know	.
the	failure	points	were	the	same	:	walls	and	slabs	not	tied	properly	into	columns	--	that	's	a	roof	slab	hanging	off	the	building	--	cantilevered	structures	,	or	structures	that	were	asymmetric	,	that	shook	violently	and	came	down	,	poor	building	materials	,	not	enough	concrete	,	not	enough	compression	in	the	blocks	,	rebar	that	was	smooth	,	rebar	that	was	exposed	to	the	weather	and	had	rusted	away	.
now	there	's	a	solution	to	all	these	problems	.
and	we	know	how	to	build	properly	.
the	proof	of	this	came	in	chile	,	almost	a	month	later	,	when	8.8	magnitude	earthquake	hit	chile	.
that	is	500	times	the	power	of	the	7.0	that	hit	port	-	au	-	prince	--	500	times	the	power	,	yet	only	under	a	thousand	casualties	.
adjusted	for	population	density	,	that	is	less	than	one	percent	of	the	impact	of	the	haitian	quake	.
what	was	the	difference	between	chile	and	haiti	?
seismic	standards	and	confined	masonry	,	where	the	building	acts	as	a	whole	--	walls	and	columns	and	roofs	and	slabs	tied	together	to	support	each	other	--	instead	of	breaking	off	into	separate	members	and	failing	.
if	you	look	at	this	building	in	chile	,	it	's	ripped	in	half	,	but	it	's	not	a	pile	of	rubble	.
chileans	have	been	building	with	confined	masonry	for	decades	.
right	now	,	aidg	is	working	with	kpff	consulting	engineers	,	architecture	for	humanity	,	to	bring	more	confined	masonry	training	into	haiti	.
this	is	xantus	daniel	;	he	's	a	mason	,	just	a	general	construction	worker	,	not	a	foreman	,	who	took	one	of	our	trainings	.
on	his	last	job	he	was	working	with	his	boss	,	and	they	started	pouring	the	columns	wrong	.
he	took	his	boss	aside	,	and	he	showed	him	the	materials	on	confined	masonry	.
he	showed	him	,	``	you	know	,	we	do	n't	have	to	do	this	wrong	.
it	wo	n't	cost	us	any	more	to	do	it	the	right	way	.	``
and	they	redid	that	building	.
they	tied	the	rebar	right	,	they	poured	the	columns	right	,	and	that	building	will	be	safe	.
and	every	building	that	they	build	going	forward	will	be	safe	.
to	make	sure	these	buildings	are	safe	,	it	's	not	going	to	take	policy	--	it	's	going	to	take	reaching	out	to	the	masons	on	the	ground	and	helping	them	learn	the	proper	techniques	.
now	there	are	many	groups	doing	this	.
and	the	fellow	in	the	vest	there	,	craig	toten	,	he	has	pushed	forward	to	get	documentation	out	to	all	the	groups	that	are	doing	this	.
through	haiti	rewired	,	through	build	change	,	architecture	for	humanity	,	aidg	,	there	is	the	possibility	to	reach	out	to	30,000	--	40,000	masons	across	the	country	and	create	a	movement	of	proper	building	.
if	you	reach	out	to	the	people	on	the	ground	in	this	collaborative	way	it	's	extremely	affordable	.
for	the	billions	spent	on	reconstruction	,	you	can	train	masons	for	dollars	on	every	house	that	they	end	up	building	over	their	lifetime	.
ultimately	,	there	are	two	ways	that	you	can	rebuild	haiti	;	the	way	at	the	top	is	the	way	that	haiti	's	been	building	for	decades	.
the	way	at	the	top	is	a	poorly	constructed	building	that	will	fail	.
the	way	at	the	bottom	is	a	confined	masonry	building	,	where	the	walls	are	tied	together	,	the	building	is	symmetric	,	and	it	will	stand	up	to	an	earthquake	.
for	all	the	disaster	,	there	is	an	opportunity	here	to	build	better	houses	for	the	next	generation	,	so	that	when	the	next	earthquake	hits	,	it	is	a	disaster	--	but	not	a	tragedy	.
