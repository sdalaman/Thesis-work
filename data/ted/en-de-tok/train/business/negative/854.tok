i	'm	going	to	tell	you	two	things	today	:	one	is	what	we	have	lost	,	and	two	,	a	way	to	bring	it	back	.
and	let	me	start	with	this	.
this	is	my	baseline	:	this	is	the	mediterranean	coast	with	no	fish	,	bare	rock	and	lots	of	sea	urchins	that	like	to	eat	the	algae	.
something	like	this	is	what	i	first	saw	when	i	jumped	in	the	water	for	the	first	time	in	the	mediterranean	coast	off	spain	.
now	,	if	an	alien	came	to	earth	--	let	's	call	him	joe	--	what	would	joe	see	?
if	joe	jumped	in	a	coral	reef	,	there	are	many	things	the	alien	could	see	.
very	unlikely	,	joe	would	jump	on	a	pristine	coral	reef	,	a	virgin	coral	reef	with	lots	of	coral	,	sharks	,	crocodiles	,	manatees	,	groupers	,	turtles	,	etc	.
so	,	probably	,	what	joe	would	see	would	be	in	this	part	,	in	the	greenish	part	of	the	picture	.
here	we	have	the	extreme	with	dead	corals	,	microbial	soup	and	jellyfish	.
and	where	the	diver	is	,	this	is	probably	where	most	of	the	reefs	of	the	world	are	now	,	with	very	few	corals	,	algae	overgrowing	the	corals	,	lots	of	bacteria	,	and	where	the	large	animals	are	gone	.
and	this	is	what	most	marine	scientists	have	seen	too	.
this	is	their	baseline	.	this	is	what	they	think	is	natural	because	we	started	modern	science	with	scuba	diving	long	after	we	started	degrading	marine	ecosystems	.
so	i	'm	going	to	get	us	all	on	a	time	machine	,	and	we	're	going	to	the	left	;	we	're	going	to	go	back	to	the	past	to	see	what	the	ocean	was	like	.
and	let	's	start	with	this	time	machine	,	the	line	islands	,	where	we	have	conducted	a	series	of	national	geographic	expeditions	.
this	sea	is	an	archipelago	belonging	to	kiribati	that	spans	across	the	equator	and	it	has	several	uninhabited	,	unfished	,	pristine	islands	and	a	few	inhabited	islands	.
so	let	's	start	with	the	first	one	:	christmas	island	,	over	5,000	people	.
most	of	the	reefs	are	dead	,	most	of	the	corals	are	dead	--	overgrown	by	algae	--	and	most	of	the	fish	are	smaller	than	the	pencils	we	use	to	count	them	.
we	did	250	hours	of	diving	here	in	2005	.
we	did	n't	see	a	single	shark	.
this	is	the	place	that	captain	cook	discovered	in	1777	and	he	described	a	huge	abundance	of	sharks	biting	the	rudders	and	the	oars	of	their	small	boats	while	they	were	going	ashore	.
let	's	move	the	dial	a	little	bit	to	the	past	.
fanning	island	,	2,500	people	.
the	corals	are	doing	better	here	.	lots	of	small	fish	.
this	is	what	many	divers	would	consider	paradise	.
this	is	where	you	can	see	most	of	the	florida	keys	national	marine	sanctuary	.
and	many	people	think	this	is	really	,	really	beautiful	,	if	this	is	your	baseline	.
if	we	go	back	to	a	place	like	palmyra	atoll	,	where	i	was	with	jeremy	jackson	a	few	years	ago	,	the	corals	are	doing	better	and	there	are	sharks	.
you	can	see	sharks	in	every	single	dive	.
and	this	is	something	that	is	very	unusual	in	today	's	coral	reefs	.
but	then	,	if	we	shift	the	dial	200	,	500	years	back	,	then	we	get	to	the	places	where	the	corals	are	absolutely	healthy	and	gorgeous	,	forming	spectacular	structures	,	and	where	the	predators	are	the	most	conspicuous	thing	,	where	you	see	between	25	and	50	sharks	per	dive	.
what	have	we	learned	from	these	places	?
this	is	what	we	thought	was	natural	.
this	is	what	we	call	the	biomass	pyramid	.
if	we	get	all	of	the	fish	of	a	coral	reef	together	and	weigh	them	,	this	is	what	we	would	expect	.
most	of	the	biomass	is	low	on	the	food	chain	,	the	herbivores	,	the	parrotfish	,	the	surgeonfish	that	eat	the	algae	.
then	the	plankton	feeders	,	these	little	damselfish	,	the	little	animals	floating	in	the	water	.
and	then	we	have	a	lower	biomass	of	carnivores	,	and	a	lower	biomass	of	top	head	,	or	the	sharks	,	the	large	snappers	,	the	large	groupers	.
but	this	is	a	consequence	.
this	view	of	the	world	is	a	consequence	of	having	studied	degraded	reefs	.
when	we	went	to	pristine	reefs	,	we	realized	that	the	natural	world	was	upside	down	;	this	pyramid	was	inverted	.
the	top	head	does	account	for	most	of	the	biomass	,	in	some	places	up	to	85	percent	,	like	kingman	reef	,	which	is	now	protected	.
the	good	news	is	that	,	in	addition	to	having	more	predators	,	there	's	more	of	everything	.
the	size	of	these	boxes	is	bigger	.
we	have	more	sharks	,	more	biomass	of	snappers	,	more	biomass	of	herbivores	,	too	,	like	these	parrot	fish	that	are	like	marine	goats	.
they	clean	the	reef	;	everything	that	grows	enough	to	be	seen	,	they	eat	,	and	they	keep	the	reef	clean	and	allow	the	corals	to	replenish	.
not	only	do	these	places	--	these	ancient	,	pristine	places	--	have	lots	of	fish	,	but	they	also	have	other	important	components	of	the	ecosystem	like	the	giant	clams	;	pavements	of	giant	clams	in	the	lagoons	,	up	to	20	,	25	per	square	meter	.
these	have	disappeared	from	every	inhabited	reef	in	the	world	,	and	they	filter	the	water	;	they	keep	the	water	clean	from	microbes	and	pathogens	.
but	still	,	now	we	have	global	warming	.
if	we	do	n't	have	fishing	because	these	reefs	are	protected	by	law	or	their	remoteness	,	this	is	great	.
but	the	water	gets	warmer	for	too	long	and	the	corals	die	.
so	how	are	these	fish	,	these	predators	going	to	help	?
well	,	what	we	have	seen	is	that	in	this	particular	area	during	el	nino	,	year	'97	,	'98	,	the	water	was	too	warm	for	too	long	,	and	many	corals	bleached	and	many	died	.
in	christmas	,	where	the	food	web	is	really	trimmed	down	,	where	the	large	animals	are	gone	,	the	corals	have	not	recovered	.
in	fanning	island	,	the	corals	are	not	recovered	.
but	you	see	here	a	big	table	coral	that	died	and	collapsed	.
and	the	fish	have	grazed	the	algae	,	so	the	turf	of	algae	is	a	little	lower	.
then	you	go	to	palmyra	atoll	that	has	more	biomass	of	herbivores	,	and	the	dead	corals	are	clean	,	and	the	corals	are	coming	back	.
and	when	you	go	to	the	pristine	side	,	did	this	ever	bleach	?
these	places	bleached	too	,	but	they	recovered	faster	.
the	more	intact	,	the	more	complete	,	[	and	]	the	more	complex	your	food	web	,	the	higher	the	resilience	,	[	and	]	the	more	likely	that	the	system	is	going	to	recover	from	the	short	-	term	impacts	of	warming	events	.
and	that	's	good	news	,	so	we	need	to	recover	that	structure	.
we	need	to	make	sure	that	all	of	the	pieces	of	the	ecosystem	are	there	so	the	ecosystem	can	adapt	to	the	effects	of	global	warming	.
so	if	we	have	to	reset	the	baseline	,	if	we	have	to	push	the	ecosystem	back	to	the	left	,	how	can	we	do	it	?
well	,	there	are	several	ways	.
one	very	clear	way	is	the	marine	protected	areas	,	especially	no	-	take	reserves	that	we	set	aside	to	allow	for	the	recovery	for	marine	life	.
and	let	me	go	back	to	that	image	of	the	mediterranean	.
this	was	my	baseline	.	this	is	what	i	saw	when	i	was	a	kid	.
and	at	the	same	time	i	was	watching	jacques	cousteau	's	shows	on	tv	,	with	all	this	richness	and	abundance	and	diversity	.
and	i	thought	that	this	richness	belonged	to	tropical	seas	,	and	that	the	mediterranean	was	a	naturally	poor	sea	.
but	,	little	did	i	know	,	until	i	jumped	for	the	first	time	in	a	marine	reserve	.
and	this	is	what	i	saw	,	lots	of	fish	.
after	a	few	years	,	between	five	and	seven	years	,	fish	come	back	,	they	eat	the	urchins	,	and	then	the	algae	grow	again	.
so	you	have	this	little	algal	forest	,	and	in	the	size	of	a	laptop	you	can	find	more	than	100	species	of	algae	,	mostly	microscopic	fit	hundreds	of	species	of	little	animals	that	then	feed	the	fish	,	so	that	the	system	recovers	.
and	this	particular	place	,	the	medes	islands	marine	reserve	,	is	only	94	hectares	,	and	it	brings	6	million	euros	to	the	local	economy	,	20	times	more	than	fishing	,	and	it	represents	88	percent	of	all	the	tourist	revenue	.
so	these	places	not	only	help	the	ecosystem	but	also	help	the	people	who	can	benefit	from	the	ecosystem	.
so	let	me	just	give	you	a	summary	of	what	no	-	take	reserves	do	.
these	places	,	when	we	protect	them	,	if	we	compare	them	to	unprotected	areas	nearby	,	this	is	what	happens	.
the	number	of	species	increases	21	percent	;	so	if	you	have	1,000	species	you	would	expect	200	more	in	a	marine	reserve	.
this	is	very	substantial	.
the	size	of	organisms	increases	a	third	,	so	your	fish	are	now	this	big	.
the	abundance	,	how	many	fish	you	have	per	square	meter	,	increases	almost	170	percent	.
and	the	biomass	--	this	is	the	most	spectacular	change	--	4.5	times	greater	biomass	on	average	,	just	after	five	to	seven	years	.
in	some	places	up	to	10	times	larger	biomass	inside	the	reserves	.
so	we	have	all	these	things	inside	the	reserve	that	grow	,	and	what	do	they	do	?
they	reproduce	.	that	's	population	biology	101	.
if	you	do	n't	kill	the	fish	,	they	take	a	longer	time	to	die	,	they	grow	larger	and	they	reproduce	a	lot	.
and	same	thing	for	invertebrates	.	this	is	the	example	.
these	are	egg	cases	laid	by	a	snail	off	the	coast	of	chile	,	and	this	is	how	many	eggs	they	lay	on	the	bottom	.
outside	the	reserve	,	you	can	not	even	detect	this	.
one	point	three	million	eggs	per	square	meter	inside	the	marine	reserve	where	these	snails	are	very	abundant	.
so	these	organisms	reproduce	,	the	little	larvae	juveniles	spill	over	,	they	all	spill	over	,	and	then	people	can	benefit	from	them	outside	too	.
this	is	in	the	bahamas	:	nassau	grouper	.
huge	abundance	of	groupers	inside	the	reserve	,	and	the	closer	you	get	to	the	reserve	,	the	more	fish	you	have	.
so	the	fishermen	are	catching	more	.
you	can	see	where	the	limits	of	the	reserve	are	because	you	see	the	boats	lined	up	.
so	there	is	spill	over	;	there	are	benefits	beyond	the	boundaries	of	these	reserves	that	help	people	around	them	,	while	at	the	same	time	the	reserve	is	protecting	the	entire	habitat	.	it	is	building	resilience	.
so	what	we	have	now	--	or	a	world	without	reserves	--	is	like	a	debit	account	where	we	withdraw	all	the	time	and	we	never	make	any	deposit	.
reserves	are	like	savings	accounts	.
we	have	this	principal	that	we	do	n't	touch	;	that	produces	returns	,	social	,	economic	and	ecological	.
and	if	we	think	about	the	increase	of	biomass	inside	the	reserves	,	this	is	like	compound	interest	.
two	examples	,	again	,	of	how	these	reserves	can	benefit	people	.
this	is	how	much	fishermen	get	everyday	in	kenya	,	fishing	over	a	series	of	years	,	in	a	place	where	there	is	no	protection	;	it	's	a	free	-	for	-	all	.
once	the	most	degrading	fishing	gear	,	seine	nets	,	were	removed	,	the	fishermen	were	catching	more	.
if	you	fish	less	,	you	're	actually	catching	more	.
but	if	we	add	the	no	-	take	reserve	on	top	of	that	,	the	fishermen	are	still	making	more	money	by	fishing	less	around	an	area	that	is	protected	.
another	example	:	nassau	groupers	in	belize	in	the	mesoamerican	reef	.
this	is	grouper	sex	,	and	the	groupers	aggregate	around	the	full	moons	of	december	and	january	for	a	week	.
they	used	to	aggregate	up	to	the	tens	of	thousands	,	30,000	groupers	about	this	big	in	one	hectare	,	in	one	aggregation	.
fishermen	knew	about	these	things	;	they	caught	them	,	and	they	depleted	them	.
when	i	went	there	for	the	first	time	in	2000	,	there	were	only	3,000	groupers	left	.
and	the	fishermen	were	authorized	to	catch	30	percent	of	the	entire	spawning	population	every	year	.
so	we	did	a	simple	analysis	,	and	it	does	n't	take	rocket	science	to	figure	out	that	,	if	you	take	30	percent	every	year	,	your	fishery	is	going	to	collapse	very	quickly	.
and	with	the	fishery	,	the	entire	reproductive	ability	of	the	species	goes	extinct	.
it	happened	in	many	places	around	the	caribbean	.
and	they	would	make	4,000	dollars	per	year	,	total	,	for	the	entire	fishery	,	several	fishing	boats	.
now	,	if	you	do	an	economic	analysis	and	project	what	would	happen	if	the	fish	were	not	cut	,	if	we	brought	just	20	divers	one	month	per	year	,	the	revenue	would	be	more	than	20	times	higher	and	that	would	be	sustainable	over	time	.
so	how	much	of	this	do	we	have	?
if	this	is	so	good	,	if	this	is	such	a	no	-	brainer	,	how	much	of	this	do	we	have	?
and	you	already	heard	that	less	than	one	percent	of	the	ocean	's	protected	.
we	're	getting	closer	to	one	percent	now	,	thanks	to	the	protections	of	the	chagos	archipelago	,	and	only	a	fraction	of	this	is	fully	protected	from	fishing	.
scientific	studies	recommend	that	at	least	20	percent	of	the	ocean	should	be	protected	.
the	estimated	range	is	between	20	and	50	percent	for	a	series	of	goals	of	biodiversity	and	fishery	enhancement	and	resilience	.
now	,	is	this	possible	?	people	would	ask	:	how	much	would	that	cost	?
well	,	let	's	think	about	how	much	we	are	paying	now	to	subsidize	fishing	:	35	billion	dollars	per	year	.
many	of	these	subsidies	go	to	destructive	fishing	practices	.
well	,	there	are	a	couple	estimates	of	how	much	it	would	cost	to	create	a	network	of	protected	areas	covering	20	percent	of	the	ocean	that	would	be	only	a	fraction	of	what	we	are	now	paying	;	the	government	hands	out	to	a	fishery	that	is	collapsing	.
people	are	losing	their	jobs	because	the	fisheries	are	collapsing	.
a	creation	of	a	network	of	reserves	would	provide	direct	employment	for	more	than	a	million	people	plus	all	the	secondary	jobs	and	all	the	secondary	benefits	.
so	how	can	we	do	that	?
if	it	's	so	clear	that	these	savings	accounts	are	good	for	the	environment	and	for	people	,	why	do	n't	we	have	20	,	50	percent	of	the	ocean	?
and	how	can	we	reach	that	goal	?
well	,	there	are	two	ways	of	getting	there	.
the	trivial	solution	is	to	create	really	large	protected	areas	like	the	chagos	archipelago	.
the	problem	is	that	we	can	create	these	large	reserves	only	in	places	where	there	are	no	people	,	where	there	is	no	social	conflict	,	where	the	political	cost	is	really	low	and	the	economic	cost	is	also	low	.
and	a	few	of	us	,	a	few	organizations	in	this	room	and	elsewhere	are	working	on	this	.
but	what	about	the	rest	of	the	coast	of	the	world	,	where	people	live	and	make	a	living	out	of	fishing	?
well	,	there	are	three	main	reasons	why	we	do	n't	have	tens	of	thousands	of	small	reserves	:	the	first	one	is	that	people	have	no	idea	what	marine	reserves	do	,	and	fishermen	tend	to	be	really	,	really	defensive	when	it	comes	to	regulating	or	closing	an	area	,	even	if	it	's	small	.
second	,	the	governance	is	not	right	because	most	coastal	communities	around	the	world	do	n't	have	the	authority	to	monitor	the	resources	to	create	the	reserve	and	enforce	it	.
it	's	a	top	down	hierarchical	structure	where	people	wait	for	government	agents	to	come	and	this	is	not	effective	.	and	the	government	does	n't	have	enough	resources	.
which	takes	us	to	the	third	reason	,	why	we	do	n't	have	many	more	reserves	,	is	that	the	funding	models	have	been	wrong	.
ngos	and	governments	spend	a	lot	of	time	and	energy	and	resources	in	a	few	small	areas	,	usually	.
so	marine	conservation	and	coastal	protection	has	become	a	sink	for	government	or	philanthropic	money	,	and	this	is	not	sustainable	.
so	the	solutions	are	just	fixing	these	three	issues	.
first	,	we	need	to	develop	a	global	awareness	campaign	to	inspire	local	communities	and	governments	to	create	no	-	take	reserves	that	are	better	than	what	we	have	now	.
it	's	the	savings	accounts	versus	the	debit	accounts	with	no	deposits	.
second	,	we	need	to	redesign	our	governance	so	conservation	efforts	can	be	decentralized	,	so	conservation	efforts	do	n't	depend	on	work	from	ngos	or	from	government	agencies	and	can	be	created	by	the	local	communities	,	like	it	happens	in	the	philippines	and	a	few	other	places	.
and	third	,	and	very	important	,	we	need	to	develop	new	business	models	.
the	philanthropy	sink	as	the	only	way	to	create	reserves	is	not	sustainable	.
we	really	need	to	develop	models	,	business	models	,	where	coastal	conservation	is	an	investment	,	because	we	already	know	that	these	marine	reserves	provide	social	,	ecological	and	economic	benefits	.
and	i	'd	like	to	finish	with	one	thought	,	which	is	that	no	one	organization	alone	is	going	to	save	the	ocean	.
there	has	been	a	lot	of	competition	in	the	past	,	and	we	need	to	develop	a	new	model	of	partnership	,	truly	collaborative	,	where	we	are	looking	for	complementing	,	not	substituting	.
the	stakes	are	just	too	high	to	continue	the	way	we	are	going	.
so	let	's	do	that	.	thank	you	very	much	.
chris	anderson	:	thank	you	enric	.
enric	sala	:	thank	you	.
ca	:	that	was	a	masterful	job	of	pulling	things	together	.
first	of	all	,	your	pyramid	,	your	inverted	pyramid	,	showing	85	percent	biomass	in	the	predators	,	that	seems	impossible	.
how	could	85	percent	survive	on	15	percent	?
es	:	well	,	imagine	that	you	have	two	gears	of	a	watch	,	a	big	one	and	a	small	one	.
the	big	one	is	moving	very	slowly	,	and	the	small	one	is	moving	fast	.
that	's	basically	it	.
the	animals	at	the	lower	parts	of	the	food	chain	,	they	reproduce	very	fast	;	they	grow	really	fast	;	they	produce	millions	of	eggs	.
up	there	,	you	have	sharks	and	large	fish	that	live	25	,	30	years	.
they	reproduce	very	slowly	;	they	have	a	slow	metabolism	;	and	,	basically	,	they	just	maintain	their	biomass	.
so	,	basically	,	the	production	surplus	of	these	guys	down	there	is	enough	to	maintain	this	biomass	that	is	not	moving	.
they	are	like	capacitors	of	the	system	.
ca	:	that	's	very	fascinating	.
so	,	really	,	our	picture	of	a	food	pyramid	is	just	--	we	have	to	change	that	completely	.
es	:	at	least	in	the	seas	.
what	we	found	in	coral	reefs	is	that	the	inverted	pyramid	is	the	equivalent	of	the	serengeti	,	with	five	lions	per	wildebeest	.
and	on	land	,	this	can	not	work	.
but	at	least	on	coral	reefs	are	systems	where	there	is	a	bottom	component	with	structure	.
we	think	this	is	universal	.
but	we	have	started	studying	pristine	reefs	only	very	recently	.
ca	:	so	the	numbers	you	presented	really	are	astonishing	.
you	're	saying	we	're	spending	35	billion	dollars	now	on	subsidies	.
it	would	only	cost	16	billion	to	set	up	20	percent	of	the	ocean	as	marine	protected	areas	that	actually	give	new	living	choices	to	the	fishermen	as	well	.
if	the	world	was	a	smarter	place	,	we	could	solve	this	problem	for	negative	19	billion	dollars	.
we	've	got	19	billion	to	spend	on	health	care	or	something	.
es	:	and	then	we	have	the	under	-	performance	of	fisheries	that	is	50	billion	dollars	.
so	again	,	one	of	the	big	solutions	is	have	the	world	trade	organization	shifting	the	subsidies	to	sustainable	practices	.
ca	:	okay	,	so	there	's	a	lot	of	examples	that	i	'm	hearing	out	there	about	ending	this	subsidies	madness	.
so	thank	you	for	those	numbers	.
the	last	one	's	a	personal	question	.
a	lot	of	the	experience	of	people	here	who	've	been	in	the	oceans	for	a	long	time	has	just	been	seeing	this	degradation	,	the	places	they	saw	that	were	beautiful	getting	worse	,	depressing	.
talk	to	me	about	the	feeling	that	you	must	have	experienced	of	going	to	these	pristine	areas	and	seeing	things	coming	back	.
es	:	it	is	a	spiritual	experience	.
we	go	there	to	try	to	understand	the	ecosystems	,	to	try	to	measure	or	count	fish	and	sharks	and	see	how	these	places	are	different	from	the	places	we	know	.
but	the	best	feeling	is	this	biophilia	that	e.o	.	wilson	talks	about	,	where	humans	have	this	sense	of	awe	and	wonder	in	front	of	untamed	nature	,	of	raw	nature	.
and	there	,	only	there	,	you	really	feel	that	you	are	part	of	a	larger	thing	or	of	a	larger	global	ecosystem	.
and	if	it	were	not	for	these	places	that	show	hope	,	i	do	n't	think	i	could	continue	doing	this	job	.
it	would	be	just	too	depressing	.
ca	:	well	,	enric	,	thank	you	so	much	for	sharing	some	of	that	spiritual	experience	with	us	all	.	thank	you	.
es	:	thank	you	very	much	.
