good	morning	everyone	.	first	of	all	,	it	's	been	fantastic	being	here	over	these	past	few	days	.
and	secondly	,	i	feel	it	's	a	great	honor	to	kind	of	wind	up	this	extraordinary	gathering	of	people	,	these	amazing	talks	that	we	've	had	.
i	feel	that	i	've	fitted	in	,	in	many	ways	,	to	some	of	the	things	that	i	've	heard	.
i	came	directly	here	from	the	deep	,	deep	tropical	rainforest	in	ecuador	,	where	i	was	out	--	you	could	only	get	there	by	a	plane	--	with	indigenous	people	with	paint	on	their	faces	and	parrot	feathers	on	their	headdresses	,	where	these	people	are	fighting	to	try	and	keep	the	oil	companies	,	and	keep	the	roads	,	out	of	their	forests	.
they	're	fighting	to	develop	their	own	way	of	living	within	the	forest	in	a	world	that	's	clean	,	a	world	that	is	n't	contaminated	,	a	world	that	is	n't	polluted	.
and	what	was	so	amazing	to	me	,	and	what	fits	right	in	with	what	we	're	all	talking	about	here	at	ted	,	is	that	there	,	right	in	the	middle	of	this	rainforest	,	was	some	solar	panels	--	the	first	in	that	part	of	ecuador	--	and	that	was	mainly	to	bring	water	up	by	pump	so	that	the	women	would	n't	have	to	go	down	.
the	water	was	cleaned	,	but	because	they	got	a	lot	of	batteries	,	they	were	able	to	store	a	lot	of	electricity	.
so	every	house	--	and	there	were	,	i	think	,	eight	houses	in	this	little	community	--	could	have	light	for	,	i	think	it	was	about	half	an	hour	each	evening	.
and	there	is	the	chief	,	in	all	his	regal	finery	,	with	a	laptop	computer	.
and	this	man	,	he	has	been	outside	,	but	he	's	gone	back	,	and	he	was	saying	,	``	you	know	,	we	have	suddenly	jumped	into	a	whole	new	era	,	and	we	did	n't	even	know	about	the	white	man	50	years	ago	,	and	now	here	we	are	with	laptop	computers	,	and	there	are	some	things	we	want	to	learn	from	the	modern	world	.
we	want	to	know	about	health	care	.
we	want	to	know	about	what	other	people	do	--	we	're	interested	in	it	.
and	we	want	to	learn	other	languages	.
we	want	to	know	english	and	french	and	perhaps	chinese	,	and	we	're	good	at	languages	.	``
so	there	he	is	with	his	little	laptop	computer	,	but	fighting	against	the	might	of	the	pressures	--	because	of	the	debt	,	the	foreign	debt	of	ecuador	--	fighting	the	pressure	of	world	bank	,	imf	,	and	of	course	the	people	who	want	to	exploit	the	forests	and	take	out	the	oil	.
and	so	,	coming	directly	from	there	to	here	.
but	,	of	course	,	my	real	field	of	expertise	lies	in	an	even	different	kind	of	civilization	--	i	ca	n't	really	call	it	a	civilization	.
a	different	way	of	life	,	a	different	being	.
we	've	talked	earlier	--	this	wonderful	talk	by	wade	davis	about	the	different	cultures	of	the	humans	around	the	world	--	but	the	world	is	not	composed	only	of	human	beings	;	there	are	also	other	animal	beings	.
and	i	propose	to	bring	into	this	ted	conference	,	as	i	always	do	around	the	world	,	the	voice	of	the	animal	kingdom	.
too	often	we	just	see	a	few	slides	,	or	a	bit	of	film	,	but	these	beings	have	voices	that	mean	something	.
and	so	,	i	want	to	give	you	a	greeting	,	as	from	a	chimpanzee	in	the	forests	of	tanzania	--	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	!
i	've	been	studying	chimpanzees	in	tanzania	since	1960	.
during	that	time	,	there	have	been	modern	technologies	that	have	really	transformed	the	way	that	field	biologists	do	their	work	.
for	example	,	for	the	first	time	,	a	few	years	ago	,	by	simply	collecting	little	fecal	samples	we	were	able	to	have	them	analyzed	--	to	have	dna	profiling	done	--	so	for	the	first	time	,	we	actually	know	which	male	chimps	are	the	fathers	of	each	individual	infant	.
because	the	chimps	have	a	very	promiscuous	mating	society	.
so	this	opens	up	a	whole	new	avenue	of	research	.
and	we	use	gsi	--	geographic	whatever	it	is	,	gsi	--	to	determine	the	range	of	the	chimps	.
and	we	're	using	--	you	can	see	that	i	'm	not	really	into	this	kind	of	stuff	--	but	we	're	using	satellite	imagery	to	look	at	the	deforestation	in	the	area	.
and	of	course	,	there	's	developments	in	infrared	,	so	you	can	watch	animals	at	night	,	and	equipment	for	recording	by	video	,	and	tape	recording	is	getting	lighter	and	better	.
so	in	many	,	many	ways	,	we	can	do	things	today	that	we	could	n't	do	when	i	began	in	1960	.
especially	when	chimpanzees	,	and	other	animals	with	large	brains	,	are	studied	in	captivity	,	modern	technology	is	helping	us	to	search	for	the	upper	levels	of	cognition	in	some	of	these	non	-	human	animals	.
so	that	we	know	today	,	they	're	capable	of	performances	that	would	have	been	thought	absolutely	impossible	by	science	when	i	began	.
i	think	the	chimpanzee	in	captivity	who	is	the	most	skilled	in	intellectual	performance	is	one	called	ai	in	japan	--	her	name	means	love	--	and	she	has	a	wonderfully	sensitive	partner	working	with	her	.
she	loves	her	computer	--	she	'll	leave	her	big	group	,	and	her	running	water	,	and	her	trees	and	everything	.
and	she	'll	come	in	to	sit	at	this	computer	--	it	's	like	a	video	game	for	a	kid	;	she	's	hooked	.
she	's	28	,	by	the	way	,	and	she	does	things	with	her	computer	screen	and	a	touch	pad	that	she	can	do	faster	than	most	humans	.
she	does	very	complex	tasks	,	and	i	have	n't	got	time	to	go	into	them	,	but	the	amazing	thing	about	this	female	is	she	does	n't	like	making	mistakes	.
if	she	has	a	bad	run	,	and	her	score	is	n't	good	,	she	'll	come	and	reach	up	and	tap	on	the	glass	--	because	she	ca	n't	see	the	experimenter	--	which	is	asking	to	have	another	go	.
and	her	concentration	--	she	's	already	concentrated	hard	for	20	minutes	or	so	,	and	now	she	wants	to	do	it	all	over	again	,	just	for	the	satisfaction	of	having	done	it	better	.
and	the	food	is	not	important	--	she	does	get	a	tiny	reward	,	like	one	raisin	for	a	correct	response	--	but	she	will	do	it	for	nothing	,	if	you	tell	her	beforehand	.
so	here	we	are	,	a	chimpanzee	using	a	computer	.
chimpanzees	,	gorillas	,	orangutans	also	learn	human	sign	language	.
but	the	point	is	that	when	i	was	first	in	gombe	in	1960	--	i	remember	so	well	,	so	vividly	,	as	though	it	was	yesterday	--	the	first	time	,	when	i	was	going	through	the	vegetation	,	the	chimpanzees	were	still	running	away	from	me	,	for	the	most	part	,	although	some	were	a	little	bit	acclimatized	--	and	i	saw	this	dark	shape	,	hunched	over	a	termite	mound	,	and	i	peered	with	my	binoculars	.
it	was	,	fortunately	,	one	adult	male	whom	i	'd	named	david	greybeard	--	and	by	the	way	,	science	at	that	time	was	telling	me	that	i	should	n't	name	the	chimps	;	they	should	all	have	numbers	;	that	was	more	scientific	.
anyway	,	david	greybeard	--	and	i	saw	that	he	was	picking	little	pieces	of	grass	and	using	them	to	fish	termites	from	their	underground	nest	.
and	not	only	that	--	he	would	sometimes	pick	a	leafy	twig	and	strip	the	leaves	--	modifying	an	object	to	make	it	suitable	for	a	specific	purpose	--	the	beginning	of	tool	-	making	.
the	reason	this	was	so	exciting	and	such	a	breakthrough	is	at	that	time	,	it	was	thought	that	humans	,	and	only	humans	,	used	and	made	tools	.
when	i	was	at	school	,	we	were	defined	as	man	,	the	toolmaker	.
so	that	when	louis	leakey	,	my	mentor	,	heard	this	news	,	he	said	,	``	ah	,	we	must	now	redefine	'	man	,	'	redefine	'	tool	,	'	or	accept	chimpanzees	as	humans	.	``
we	now	know	that	at	gombe	alone	,	there	are	nine	different	ways	in	which	chimpanzees	use	different	objects	for	different	purposes	.
moreover	,	we	know	that	in	different	parts	of	africa	,	wherever	chimps	have	been	studied	,	there	are	completely	different	tool	-	using	behaviors	.
and	because	it	seems	that	these	patterns	are	passed	from	one	generation	to	the	next	,	through	observation	,	imitation	and	practice	--	that	is	a	definition	of	human	culture	.
what	we	find	is	that	over	these	40	-	odd	years	that	i	and	others	have	been	studying	chimpanzees	and	the	other	great	apes	,	and	,	as	i	say	,	other	mammals	with	complex	brains	and	social	systems	,	we	have	found	that	after	all	,	there	is	n't	a	sharp	line	dividing	humans	from	the	rest	of	the	animal	kingdom	.
it	's	a	very	wuzzy	line	.
it	's	getting	wuzzier	all	the	time	as	we	find	animals	doing	things	that	we	,	in	our	arrogance	,	used	to	think	was	just	human	.
the	chimps	--	there	's	no	time	to	discuss	their	fascinating	lives	--	but	they	have	this	long	childhood	,	five	years	of	suckling	and	sleeping	with	the	mother	,	and	then	another	three	,	four	or	five	years	of	emotional	dependence	on	her	,	even	when	the	next	child	is	born	.
the	importance	of	learning	in	that	time	,	when	behavior	is	flexible	--	and	there	's	an	awful	lot	to	learn	in	chimpanzee	society	.
the	long	-	term	affectionate	supportive	bonds	that	develop	throughout	this	long	childhood	with	the	mother	,	with	the	brothers	and	sisters	,	and	which	can	last	through	a	lifetime	,	which	may	be	up	to	60	years	.
they	can	actually	live	longer	than	60	in	captivity	,	so	we	've	only	done	40	years	in	the	wild	so	far	.
and	we	find	chimps	are	capable	of	true	compassion	and	altruism	.
we	find	in	their	non	-	verbal	communication	--	this	is	very	rich	--	they	have	a	lot	of	sounds	,	which	they	use	in	different	circumstances	,	but	they	also	use	touch	,	posture	,	gesture	,	and	what	do	they	do	?
they	kiss	;	they	embrace	;	they	hold	hands	.
they	pat	one	another	on	the	back	;	they	swagger	;	they	shake	their	fist	--	the	kind	of	things	that	we	do	,	and	they	do	them	in	the	same	kind	of	context	.
they	have	very	sophisticated	cooperation	.
sometimes	they	hunt	--	not	that	often	,	but	when	they	hunt	,	they	show	sophisticated	cooperation	,	and	they	share	the	prey	.
we	find	that	they	show	emotions	,	similar	to	--	maybe	sometimes	the	same	--	as	those	that	we	describe	in	ourselves	as	happiness	,	sadness	,	fear	,	despair	.
they	know	mental	as	well	as	physical	suffering	.
and	i	do	n't	have	time	to	go	into	the	information	that	will	prove	some	of	these	things	to	you	,	save	to	say	that	there	are	very	bright	students	,	in	the	best	universities	,	studying	emotions	in	animals	,	studying	personalities	in	animals	.
we	know	that	chimpanzees	and	some	other	creatures	can	recognize	themselves	in	mirrors	--	``	self	``	as	opposed	to	``	other	.	``
they	have	a	sense	of	humor	,	and	these	are	the	kind	of	things	which	traditionally	have	been	thought	of	as	human	prerogatives	.
but	this	teaches	us	a	new	respect	--	and	it	's	a	new	respect	not	only	for	the	chimpanzees	,	i	suggest	,	but	some	of	the	other	amazing	animals	with	whom	we	share	this	planet	.
once	we	're	prepared	to	admit	that	after	all	,	we	're	not	the	only	beings	with	personalities	,	minds	and	above	all	feelings	,	and	then	we	start	to	think	about	ways	we	use	and	abuse	so	many	other	sentient	,	sapient	creatures	on	this	planet	,	it	really	gives	cause	for	deep	shame	,	at	least	for	me	.
so	,	the	sad	thing	is	that	these	chimpanzees	--	who	've	perhaps	taught	us	,	more	than	any	other	creature	,	a	little	humility	--	are	in	the	wild	,	disappearing	very	fast	.
they	're	disappearing	for	the	reasons	that	all	of	you	in	this	room	know	only	too	well	.
the	deforestation	,	the	growth	of	human	populations	,	needing	more	land	.
they	're	disappearing	because	some	timber	companies	go	in	with	clear	-	cutting	.
they	're	disappearing	in	the	heart	of	their	range	in	africa	because	the	big	multinational	logging	companies	have	come	in	and	made	roads	--	as	they	want	to	do	in	ecuador	and	other	parts	where	the	forests	remain	untouched	--	to	take	out	oil	or	timber	.
and	this	has	led	in	congo	basin	,	and	other	parts	of	the	world	,	to	what	is	known	as	the	bush	-	meat	trade	.
this	means	that	although	for	hundreds	,	perhaps	thousands	of	years	,	people	have	lived	in	those	forests	,	or	whatever	habitat	it	is	,	in	harmony	with	their	world	,	just	killing	the	animals	they	need	for	themselves	and	their	families	--	now	,	suddenly	,	because	of	the	roads	,	the	hunters	can	go	in	from	the	towns	.
they	shoot	everything	,	every	single	thing	that	moves	that	's	bigger	than	a	small	rat	;	they	sun	-	dry	it	or	smoke	it	.
and	now	they	've	got	transport	;	they	take	it	on	the	logging	trucks	or	the	mining	trucks	into	the	towns	where	they	sell	it	.
and	people	will	pay	more	for	bush	-	meat	,	as	it	's	called	,	than	for	domestic	meat	--	it	's	culturally	preferred	.
and	it	's	not	sustainable	,	and	the	huge	logging	camps	in	the	forest	are	now	demanding	meat	,	so	the	pygmy	hunters	in	the	congo	basin	who	've	lived	there	with	their	wonderful	way	of	living	for	so	many	hundreds	of	years	are	now	corrupted	.
they	're	given	weapons	;	they	shoot	for	the	logging	camps	;	they	get	money	.
their	culture	is	being	destroyed	,	along	with	the	animals	upon	whom	they	depend	.
so	,	when	the	logging	camp	moves	,	there	's	nothing	left	.
we	talked	already	about	the	loss	of	human	cultural	diversity	,	and	i	've	seen	it	happening	with	my	own	eyes	.
and	the	grim	picture	in	africa	--	i	love	africa	,	and	what	do	we	see	in	africa	?
we	see	deforestation	;	we	see	the	desert	spreading	;	we	see	massive	hunger	;	we	see	disease	and	we	see	population	growth	in	areas	where	there	are	more	people	living	on	a	certain	piece	of	land	than	the	land	can	possibly	support	,	and	they	're	too	poor	to	buy	food	from	elsewhere	.
were	the	people	that	we	heard	about	yesterday	,	on	the	easter	island	,	who	cut	down	their	last	tree	--	were	they	stupid	?
did	n't	they	know	what	was	happening	?
of	course	,	but	if	you	've	seen	the	crippling	poverty	in	some	of	these	parts	of	the	world	it	is	n't	a	question	of	``	let	's	leave	the	tree	for	tomorrow	.	``
``	how	am	i	going	to	feed	my	family	today	?
maybe	i	can	get	just	a	few	dollars	from	this	last	tree	which	will	keep	us	going	a	little	bit	longer	,	and	then	we	'll	pray	that	something	will	happen	to	save	us	from	the	inevitable	end	.	``
so	,	this	is	a	pretty	grim	picture	.
the	one	thing	we	have	,	which	makes	us	so	different	from	chimpanzees	or	other	living	creatures	,	is	this	sophisticated	spoken	language	--	a	language	with	which	we	can	tell	children	about	things	that	are	n't	here	.
we	can	talk	about	the	distant	past	,	plan	for	the	distant	future	,	discuss	ideas	with	each	other	,	so	that	the	ideas	can	grow	from	the	accumulated	wisdom	of	a	group	.
we	can	do	it	by	talking	to	each	other	;	we	can	do	it	through	video	;	we	can	do	it	through	the	written	word	.
and	we	are	abusing	this	great	power	we	have	to	be	wise	stewards	,	and	we	're	destroying	the	world	.
in	the	developed	world	,	in	a	way	,	it	's	worse	,	because	we	have	so	much	access	to	knowledge	of	the	stupidity	of	what	we	're	doing	.
do	you	know	,	we	're	bringing	little	babies	into	a	world	where	,	in	many	places	,	the	water	is	poisoning	them	?
and	the	air	is	harming	them	,	and	the	food	that	's	grown	from	the	contaminated	land	is	poisoning	them	.
and	that	's	not	just	in	the	far	-	away	developing	world	;	that	's	everywhere	.
do	you	know	we	all	have	about	50	chemicals	in	our	bodies	we	did	n't	have	about	50	years	ago	?
and	so	many	of	these	diseases	,	like	asthma	and	certain	kinds	of	cancers	,	are	on	the	increase	around	places	where	our	filthy	toxic	waste	is	dumped	.
we	're	harming	ourselves	around	the	world	,	as	well	as	harming	the	animals	,	as	well	as	harming	nature	herself	--	mother	nature	,	that	brought	us	into	being	;	mother	nature	,	where	i	believe	we	need	to	spend	time	,	where	there	's	trees	and	flowers	and	birds	for	our	good	psychological	development	.
and	yet	,	there	are	hundreds	and	hundreds	of	children	in	the	developed	world	who	never	see	nature	,	because	they	're	growing	up	in	concrete	and	all	they	know	is	virtual	reality	,	with	no	opportunity	to	go	and	lie	in	the	sun	,	or	in	the	forest	,	with	the	dappled	sun	-	specks	coming	down	from	the	canopy	above	.
as	i	was	traveling	around	the	world	,	you	know	,	i	had	to	leave	the	forest	--	that	's	where	i	love	to	be	.
i	had	to	leave	these	fascinating	chimpanzees	for	my	students	and	field	staff	to	continue	studying	because	,	finding	they	dwindled	from	about	two	million	100	years	ago	to	about	150,000	now	,	i	knew	i	had	to	leave	the	forest	to	do	what	i	could	to	raise	awareness	around	the	world	.
and	the	more	i	talked	about	the	chimpanzees	'	plight	,	the	more	i	realized	the	fact	that	everything	's	interconnected	,	and	the	problems	of	the	developing	world	so	often	stem	from	the	greed	of	the	developed	world	,	and	everything	was	joining	together	,	and	making	--	not	sense	,	hope	lies	in	sense	,	you	said	--	it	's	making	a	nonsense	.
how	can	we	do	it	?
somebody	said	that	yesterday	.
and	as	i	was	traveling	around	,	i	kept	meeting	young	people	who	'd	lost	hope	.
they	were	feeling	despair	,	they	were	feeling	,	``	well	,	it	does	n't	matter	what	we	do	;	eat	,	drink	and	be	merry	,	for	tomorrow	we	die	.
everything	is	hopeless	--	we	're	always	being	told	so	by	the	media	.	``
and	then	i	met	some	who	were	angry	,	and	anger	that	can	turn	to	violence	,	and	we	're	all	familiar	with	that	.
and	i	have	three	little	grandchildren	,	and	when	some	of	these	students	would	say	to	me	at	high	school	or	university	,	they	'd	say	,	``	we	're	angry	,	``	or	``	we	're	filled	with	despair	,	because	we	feel	you	've	compromised	our	future	,	and	there	's	nothing	we	can	do	about	it	.	``
and	i	looked	in	the	eyes	of	my	little	grandchildren	,	and	think	how	much	we	've	harmed	this	planet	since	i	was	their	age	.
i	feel	this	deep	shame	,	and	that	's	why	in	1991	in	tanzania	,	i	started	a	program	that	's	called	roots	and	shoots	.
there	's	little	brochures	all	around	outside	,	and	if	any	of	you	have	anything	to	do	with	children	and	care	about	their	future	,	i	beg	that	you	pick	up	that	brochure	.
and	roots	and	shoots	is	a	program	for	hope	.
roots	make	a	firm	foundation	.
shoots	seem	tiny	,	but	to	reach	the	sun	they	can	break	through	brick	walls	.
see	the	brick	walls	as	all	the	problems	that	we	've	inflicted	on	this	planet	.
then	,	you	see	,	it	is	a	message	of	hope	.
hundreds	and	thousands	of	young	people	around	the	world	can	break	through	,	and	can	make	this	a	better	world	.
and	the	most	important	message	of	roots	and	shoots	is	that	every	single	individual	makes	a	difference	.
every	individual	has	a	role	to	play	.
every	one	of	us	impacts	the	world	around	us	everyday	,	and	you	scientists	know	that	you	ca	n't	actually	--	even	if	you	stay	in	bed	all	day	,	you	're	breathing	oxygen	and	giving	out	co	2	,	and	probably	going	to	the	loo	,	and	things	like	that	--	you	're	making	a	difference	in	the	world	.
so	,	the	roots	and	shoots	program	involves	youth	in	three	kinds	of	projects	.
and	these	are	projects	to	make	the	world	around	them	a	better	place	.
one	project	to	show	care	and	concern	for	your	own	human	community	.
one	for	animals	,	including	domestic	animals	--	and	i	have	to	say	,	i	learned	everything	i	know	about	animal	behavior	even	before	i	got	to	gombe	and	the	chimps	from	my	dog	,	rusty	,	who	was	my	childhood	companion	.
and	the	third	kind	of	project	:	something	for	the	local	environment	.
so	what	the	kids	do	depends	first	of	all	,	how	old	are	they	--	and	we	go	now	from	pre	-	school	right	through	university	.
it	's	going	to	depend	whether	they	're	inner	-	city	or	rural	.
it	's	going	to	depend	if	they	're	wealthy	or	impoverished	.
it	's	going	to	depend	which	part	,	say	,	of	america	they	're	in	.
we	're	in	every	state	now	,	and	the	problems	in	florida	are	different	from	the	problems	in	new	york	.
it	's	going	to	depend	on	which	country	they	're	in	--	and	we	're	already	in	60	-	plus	countries	,	with	about	5,000	active	groups	--	and	there	are	groups	all	over	the	place	that	i	keep	hearing	about	that	i	've	never	even	heard	of	,	because	the	kids	are	taking	the	program	and	spreading	it	themselves	.
why	?
because	they	're	buying	into	it	,	and	they	're	the	ones	who	get	to	decide	what	they	're	going	to	do	.
it	is	n't	something	that	their	parents	tell	them	,	or	their	teachers	tell	them	.
that	's	effective	,	but	if	they	decide	themselves	,	``	we	want	to	clean	this	river	and	put	the	fish	back	that	used	to	be	there	.
we	want	to	clear	away	the	toxic	soil	from	this	area	and	have	an	organic	garden	.
we	want	to	go	and	spend	time	with	the	old	people	and	hear	their	stories	and	record	their	oral	histories	.
we	want	to	go	and	work	in	a	dog	shelter	.
we	want	to	learn	about	animals	.	we	want	...	``	you	know	,	it	goes	on	and	on	,	and	this	is	very	hopeful	for	me	.
as	i	travel	around	the	world	300	days	a	year	,	everywhere	there	's	a	group	of	roots	and	shoots	of	different	ages	.
everywhere	there	are	children	with	shining	eyes	saying	,	``	look	at	the	difference	we	've	made	.	``
and	now	comes	the	technology	into	it	,	because	with	this	new	way	of	communicating	electronically	these	kids	can	communicate	with	each	other	around	the	world	.
and	if	anyone	is	interested	to	help	us	,	we	've	got	so	many	ideas	but	we	need	help	--	we	need	help	to	create	the	right	kind	of	system	that	will	help	these	young	people	to	communicate	their	excitement	.
but	also	--	and	this	is	so	important	--	to	communicate	their	despair	,	to	say	,	``	we	've	tried	this	and	it	does	n't	work	,	and	what	shall	we	do	?	``
and	then	,	lo	and	behold	,	there	's	another	group	answering	these	kids	who	may	be	in	america	,	or	maybe	this	is	a	group	in	israel	,	saying	,	``	yeah	,	you	did	it	a	little	bit	wrong	.	this	is	how	you	should	do	it	.	``
the	philosophy	is	very	simple	.
we	do	not	believe	in	violence	.
no	violence	,	no	bombs	,	no	guns	.
that	's	not	the	way	to	solve	problems	.
violence	leads	to	violence	,	at	least	in	my	view	.
so	how	do	we	solve	?
the	tools	for	solving	the	problems	are	knowledge	and	understanding	.
know	the	facts	,	but	see	how	they	fit	in	the	big	picture	.
hard	work	and	persistence	--	do	n't	give	up	--	and	love	and	compassion	leading	to	respect	for	all	life	.
how	many	more	minutes	?	two	,	one	?
chris	anderson	:	one	--	one	to	two	.
jane	goodall	:	two	,	two	,	i	'm	going	to	take	two	.
are	you	going	to	come	and	drag	me	off	?
anyway	--	so	basically	,	roots	and	shoots	is	beginning	to	change	young	people	's	lives	.
it	's	what	i	'm	devoting	most	of	my	energy	to	.
and	i	believe	that	a	group	like	this	can	have	a	very	major	impact	,	not	just	because	you	can	share	technology	with	us	,	but	because	so	many	of	you	have	children	.
and	if	you	take	this	program	out	,	and	give	it	to	your	children	,	they	have	such	a	good	opportunity	to	go	out	and	do	good	,	because	they	've	got	parents	like	you	.
and	it	's	been	so	clear	how	much	you	all	care	about	trying	to	make	this	world	a	better	place	.
it	's	very	encouraging	.
but	the	kids	do	ask	me	--	and	this	wo	n't	take	more	than	two	minutes	,	i	promise	--	the	kids	say	,	``	dr.	jane	,	do	you	really	have	hope	for	the	future	?
you	travel	,	you	see	all	these	horrible	things	happening	.	``
firstly	,	the	human	brain	--	i	do	n't	need	to	say	anything	about	that	.
now	that	we	know	what	the	problems	are	around	the	world	,	human	brains	like	yours	are	rising	to	solve	those	problems	.
and	we	've	talked	a	lot	about	that	.
secondly	,	the	resilience	of	nature	.
we	can	destroy	a	river	,	and	we	can	bring	it	back	to	life	.
we	can	see	a	whole	area	desolated	,	and	it	can	be	brought	back	to	bloom	again	,	with	time	or	a	little	help	.
and	thirdly	,	the	last	speaker	talked	about	--	or	the	speaker	before	last	,	talked	about	the	indomitable	human	spirit	.
we	are	surrounded	by	the	most	amazing	people	who	do	things	that	seem	to	be	absolutely	impossible	.
nelson	mandela	--	i	take	a	little	piece	of	limestone	from	robben	island	prison	,	where	he	labored	for	27	years	,	and	came	out	with	so	little	bitterness	,	he	could	lead	his	people	from	the	horror	of	apartheid	without	a	bloodbath	.
even	after	the	11th	of	september	--	and	i	was	in	new	york	and	i	felt	the	fear	--	nevertheless	,	there	was	so	much	human	courage	,	so	much	love	and	so	much	compassion	.
and	then	as	i	went	around	the	country	after	that	and	felt	the	fear	--	the	fear	that	was	leading	to	people	feeling	they	could	n't	worry	about	the	environment	any	more	,	in	case	they	seemed	not	to	be	patriotic	--	and	i	was	trying	to	encourage	them	,	somebody	came	up	with	a	little	quotation	from	mahatma	gandhi	,	``	if	you	look	back	through	human	history	,	you	see	that	every	evil	regime	has	been	overcome	by	good	.	``
and	just	after	that	a	woman	brought	me	this	little	bell	,	and	i	want	to	end	on	this	note	.
she	said	,	``	if	you	're	talking	about	hope	and	peace	,	ring	this	.
this	bell	is	made	from	metal	from	a	defused	landmine	,	from	the	killing	fields	of	pol	pot	--	one	of	the	most	evil	regimes	in	human	history	--	where	people	are	now	beginning	to	put	their	lives	back	together	after	the	regime	has	crumbled	.
so	,	yes	,	there	is	hope	,	and	where	is	the	hope	?
is	it	out	there	with	the	politicians	?
it	's	in	our	hands	.
it	's	in	your	hands	and	my	hands	and	those	of	our	children	.
it	's	really	up	to	us	.
we	're	the	ones	who	can	make	a	difference	.
if	we	lead	lives	where	we	consciously	leave	the	lightest	possible	ecological	footprints	,	if	we	buy	the	things	that	are	ethical	for	us	to	buy	and	do	n't	buy	the	things	that	are	not	,	we	can	change	the	world	overnight	.
thank	you	.
