it	's	pretty	simple	.	there	are	nine	,	sort	of	,	rules	that	i	discovered	after	35	years	of	rock	climbing	.
most	of	them	are	pretty	basic	.
number	one	:	do	n't	let	go	--	very	sure	success	method	.
but	really	,	truly	--	often	you	think	about	letting	go	way	before	your	body	does	.
so	hang	in	there	,	and	you	come	up	with	some	pretty	peculiar	solutions	.
number	two	:	hesitation	is	bad	.
this	is	a	friction	climb	,	up	in	tuolumne	meadows	,	in	the	yosemite	high	country	.
friction	climbing	does	n't	have	any	sort	of	hard	positive	edges	.
you	're	climbing	on	little	dimples	and	nubbins	in	the	rock	.
the	most	friction	you	have	is	when	you	first	put	your	hand	or	your	foot	on	the	rock	.
and	then	from	that	point	on	,	you	're	basically	falling	.
so	momentum	is	good	.	do	n't	stop	.
rule	number	three	:	have	a	plan	.
this	is	a	climb	called	the	naked	edge	,	in	el	dorado	canyon	,	outside	of	boulder	.
this	climber	is	on	the	last	pitch	of	it	.
he	's	actually	right	about	where	i	fell	.
there	is	about	1,000	feet	of	air	below	him	.
and	all	the	hard	pitches	are	actually	below	him	.
often	what	happens	is	you	're	planning	so	hard	for	like	,	``	how	do	i	get	through	the	hardest	part	?	how	do	i	get	through	the	hardest	part	?	``
and	then	what	happens	?
you	get	to	the	last	pitch	.	it	's	easy	.
and	you	're	completely	flamed	out	.	do	n't	do	it	.
you	have	to	plan	ahead	to	get	to	the	top	.
but	you	also	ca	n't	forget	that	each	individual	move	you	have	to	be	able	to	complete	.
this	is	a	climb	called	the	dike	route	,	on	pywjack	dome	,	up	in	the	yosemite	high	country	.
the	interesting	thing	about	this	climb	is	it	's	not	that	hard	.
but	if	you	're	the	leader	on	it	,	at	the	hardest	move	,	you	're	looking	at	about	100	foot	fall	,	onto	some	low	angle	slabs	.
so	you	've	got	to	focus	.
you	do	n't	want	to	stop	in	the	middle	like	coleridge	's	kubla	kahn	.
you	've	got	to	keep	going	.
rule	number	five	:	know	how	to	rest	.
it	's	amazing	.	the	best	climbers	are	the	ones	that	in	the	most	extreme	situations	can	get	their	bodies	into	some	position	where	they	can	rest	,	regroup	,	calm	themselves	,	focus	,	and	keep	going	.
this	is	a	climb	in	the	needles	,	again	in	california	.
fear	really	sucks	because	what	it	means	is	you	're	not	focusing	on	what	you	're	doing	.
you	're	focusing	on	the	consequences	of	failing	at	what	you	're	doing	because	any	given	move	should	require	all	your	concentration	and	thought	processes	to	execute	it	effectively	.
one	of	the	things	in	climbing	is	,	most	people	sort	of	take	it	straight	on	.	and	they	follow	the	most	obvious	solution	.
this	is	the	devils	tower	in	wyoming	,	which	is	a	columnar	basalt	formation	that	most	of	you	probably	know	from	``	close	encounters	.	``
with	this	,	typically	crack	climbers	would	put	their	hands	in	and	their	toes	in	and	just	start	climbing	.
the	cracks	are	too	small	to	get	your	toes	into	so	the	only	way	to	climb	is	using	your	fingertips	in	the	cracks	,	and	using	opposing	pressure	and	forcing	yourself	up	.
rule	number	eight	:	strength	does	n't	always	equal	success	.
in	the	35	years	i	've	been	a	climbing	guide	and	taught	on	indoor	walls	,	and	stuff	like	that	,	the	most	important	thing	i	've	learned	was	,	guys	will	always	try	to	do	pull	-	ups	.
beginning	guys	,	it	's	like	,	they	thrash	,	they	thrash	,	they	get	15	feet	up	--	and	they	can	do	about	15	pull	-	ups	right	--	and	then	they	just	flame	out	.
women	are	much	more	in	balance	because	they	do	n't	have	that	idea	that	they	're	going	to	be	able	to	do	100	pull	-	ups	.
they	think	about	how	to	get	the	weight	over	their	feet	because	it	's	sort	of	natural	--	they	carry	you	all	day	long	.
so	balance	is	really	critical	,	and	keeping	your	weight	on	your	feet	,	which	is	your	strongest	muscle	.
and	of	course	there	is	rule	number	nine	.
i	came	up	with	rule	number	nine	after	i	actually	did	n't	plan	for	a	fall	,	and	went	about	40	feet	and	cracked	a	rib	.
once	you	get	to	that	point	where	you	know	it	's	going	to	happen	,	you	need	to	start	thinking	about	how	you	're	going	to	let	go	because	that	is	the	critical	piece	of	not	getting	hurt	--	how	you	're	going	to	fall	onto	the	rope	,	or	if	you	're	climbing	without	a	rope	,	fall	to	a	place	where	you	can	actually	control	the	fall	.
so	do	n't	hang	on	till	the	bitter	end	.
thank	you	very	much	.
