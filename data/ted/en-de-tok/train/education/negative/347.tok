when	i	knew	i	was	going	to	come	to	speak	to	you	,	i	thought	,	``	i	got	ta	call	my	mother	.	``
i	have	a	little	cuban	mother	--	she	's	about	that	big	.
four	feet	.	nothing	larger	than	the	sum	of	her	figurative	parts	.
you	still	with	me	?
i	called	her	up	.
``	hello	,	how	're	you	doing	,	baby	?	``
``	hey	,	ma	,	i	got	to	talk	to	you	.	``
``	you	're	talking	to	me	already	.	what	's	the	matter	?	``
i	said	,	``	i	've	got	to	talk	to	a	bunch	of	nice	people	.	``
``	you	're	always	talking	to	nice	people	,	except	when	you	went	to	the	white	house	.	``
``	ma	,	do	n't	start	!	``
and	i	told	her	i	was	coming	to	ted	,	and	she	said	,	``	what	's	the	problem	?	``
and	i	said	,	``	well	,	i	'm	not	sure	.	``
i	said	,	``	i	have	to	talk	to	them	about	stories	.
it	's	'	technology	,	entertainment	and	design	.	'	``	and	she	said	,	``	well	,	you	design	a	story	when	you	make	it	up	,	it	's	entertainment	when	you	tell	it	,	and	you	're	going	to	use	a	microphone	.	``
i	said	,	``	you	're	a	peach	,	ma	.	pop	there	?	``
``	what	's	the	matter	?	the	pearls	of	wisdom	leaping	from	my	lips	like	lemmings	is	no	good	for	you	?	``
then	my	pop	got	on	there	.
my	pop	,	he	's	one	of	the	old	souls	,	you	know	--	old	cuban	man	from	camaguey	.
camaguey	is	a	province	in	cuba	.
he	's	from	florida	.
he	was	born	there	in	1924	.
he	grew	up	in	a	bohio	of	dirt	floors	,	and	the	structure	was	the	kind	used	by	the	tainos	,	our	old	arawak	ancestors	.
my	father	is	at	once	quick	-	witted	,	wickedly	funny	,	and	then	poignancy	turns	on	a	dime	and	leaves	you	breathless	.
``	papi	,	help	.	``
``	i	already	heard	your	mother	.	i	think	she	's	right	.	``
``	after	what	i	just	told	you	?	``
my	whole	life	,	my	father	's	been	there	.
so	we	talked	for	a	few	minutes	,	and	he	said	,	``	why	do	n't	you	tell	them	what	you	believe	?	``
i	love	that	,	but	we	do	n't	have	the	time	.
good	storytelling	is	crafting	a	story	that	someone	wants	to	listen	to	.
great	story	is	the	art	of	letting	go	.
so	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	little	story	.
remember	,	this	tradition	comes	to	us	not	from	the	mists	of	avalon	,	back	in	time	,	but	further	still	,	before	we	were	scratching	out	these	stories	on	papyrus	,	or	we	were	doing	the	pictographs	on	walls	in	moist	,	damp	caves	.
back	then	,	we	had	an	urge	,	a	need	,	to	tell	the	story	.
when	lexus	wants	to	sell	you	a	car	,	they	're	telling	you	a	story	.
have	you	been	watching	the	commercials	?
because	every	one	of	us	has	this	desire	,	for	once	--	just	once	--	to	tell	our	story	and	have	it	heard	.
there	are	stories	you	tell	from	stages	.
there	's	stories	that	you	may	tell	in	a	small	group	of	people	with	some	good	wine	.
and	there	's	stories	you	tell	late	at	night	to	a	friend	,	maybe	once	in	your	life	.
and	then	there	are	stories	that	we	whisper	into	a	stygian	darkness	.
i	'm	not	telling	you	that	story	.
i	'm	telling	you	this	one	.
it	's	called	,	``	you	're	going	to	miss	me	.	``
it	's	about	human	connection	.
my	cuban	mother	,	which	i	just	briefly	introduced	you	to	in	that	short	character	sketch	,	came	to	the	united	states	one	thousand	years	ago	.
i	was	born	in	19	--	i	forget	,	and	i	came	to	this	country	with	them	in	the	aftermath	of	the	cuban	revolution	.
we	went	from	havana	,	cuba	to	decatur	,	georgia	.
and	decatur	,	georgia	's	a	small	southern	town	.
and	in	that	little	southern	town	,	i	grew	up	,	and	grew	up	hearing	these	stories	.
but	this	story	only	happened	a	few	years	ago	.
i	called	my	mom	.
it	was	a	saturday	morning	.
and	i	was	calling	about	how	to	make	ajiaco	.	it	's	a	cuban	meal	.
it	's	delicious	.	it	's	savory	.
it	makes	spit	froth	in	the	little	corners	of	your	mouth	--	is	that	enough	?	it	makes	your	armpits	juicy	,	you	know	?
that	kind	of	food	,	yeah	.
this	is	the	sensory	part	of	the	program	,	people	.
i	called	my	mother	,	and	she	said	,	``	carmen	,	i	need	you	to	come	,	please	.
i	need	to	go	to	the	mall	,	and	you	know	your	father	now	,	he	takes	a	nap	in	the	afternoon	,	and	i	got	to	go	.
i	got	an	errand	to	run	.	``
let	me	parenthetically	pause	here	and	tell	you	--	esther	,	my	mother	,	had	stopped	driving	several	years	ago	,	to	the	collective	relief	of	the	entire	city	of	atlanta	.
any	vehicular	outing	with	that	woman	from	the	time	i	was	a	young	child	,	guys	,	naturally	included	flashing	,	blue	lights	.
but	she	'd	become	adept	at	dodging	the	boys	in	blue	,	and	when	she	did	meet	them	,	oh	,	she	had	wonderful	,	well	,	rapport	.
``	ma'am	,	did	you	know	that	was	a	light	you	just	ran	?	``
``	you	do	n't	speak	english	?	``
``	no.	``
but	eventually	,	every	dog	has	its	day	,	and	she	ended	up	in	traffic	court	,	where	she	bartered	with	the	judge	for	a	discount	.
there	's	a	historical	marker	.
but	now	she	was	a	septuagenarian	,	she	'd	stopped	driving	.
and	that	meant	that	everyone	in	the	family	had	to	sign	up	to	take	her	to	have	her	hair	dyed	,	you	know	,	that	peculiar	color	of	blue	that	matches	her	polyester	pants	suit	,	you	know	,	same	color	as	the	buick	.
anybody	?	all	right	.
little	picks	on	the	legs	,	where	she	does	her	needlepoint	,	and	leaves	little	loops	.
rockports	--	they	're	for	this	.
that	's	why	they	call	them	that	.
this	is	her	ensemble	.
and	this	is	the	woman	that	wants	me	to	come	on	a	saturday	morning	when	i	have	a	lot	to	do	,	but	it	does	n't	take	long	because	cuban	guilt	is	a	weighty	thing	.
i	'm	not	going	political	on	you	but	...	and	so	,	i	go	to	my	mother	's	.
i	show	up	.	she	's	in	the	carport	.
of	course	,	they	have	a	carport	.
the	kind	with	the	corrugated	roof	,	you	know	.
the	buick	's	parked	outside	,	and	she	's	jingling	,	jangling	a	pair	of	keys	.
``	i	got	a	surprise	for	you	,	baby	!	``
``	we	taking	your	car	?	``
``	not	we	,	i.	``
and	she	reaches	into	her	pocket	and	pulls	out	a	catastrophe	.
somebody	's	storytelling	.	interactive	art	.	you	can	talk	to	me	.
oh	,	a	driver	's	license	,	a	perfectly	valid	driver	's	license	.
issued	,	evidently	,	by	the	dmv	in	her	own	county	of	gwinnett	.
blithering	fucking	idiots	.
i	said	,	``	is	that	thing	real	?	``
``	i	think	so	.	``
``	can	you	even	see	?	``
``	i	guess	i	must	.	``
``	oh	,	jesus	.	``
she	gets	into	the	car	--	she	's	sitting	on	two	phone	books	.
i	ca	n't	even	make	this	part	up	because	she	's	that	tiny	.
she	's	engineered	an	umbrella	so	she	can	--	bam	!	--	slam	the	door	.
her	daughter	,	me	,	the	village	idiot	with	the	ice	cream	cone	in	the	middle	of	her	forehead	,	is	still	standing	there	,	slack	-	jawed	.
``	you	coming	?	you	no	coming	?	``
``	oh	,	my	god	.	``	i	said	,	``	ok	,	fine	.	does	pop	know	you	're	driving	?	``
``	are	you	kidding	me	?	``
``	how	are	you	doing	it	?	``
``	he	's	got	to	sleep	sometime	.	``
and	so	we	left	my	father	fast	asleep	,	because	i	knew	he	'd	kill	me	if	i	let	her	go	by	herself	,	and	we	get	in	the	car	.
puts	it	in	reverse	.	fifty	-	five	out	of	the	driveway	,	in	reverse	.
i	am	buckling	in	seatbelts	from	the	front	.
i	'm	yanking	them	in	from	the	back	.	i	'm	doing	double	knots	.
i	mean	,	i	've	got	a	mouth	as	dry	as	the	kalahari	desert	.
i	've	got	a	white	-	knuckle	grip	on	the	door	.	you	know	what	i	'm	talking	about	?
and	she	's	whistling	,	and	finally	i	do	the	kind	of	birth	breathing	--	you	know	,	that	one	?
only	a	couple	of	women	are	going	uh	-	huh	,	uh	-	huh	,	uh	-	huh	.	right	.
and	i	said	,	``	ma	,	would	you	slow	down	?	``
because	now	she	's	picked	up	the	highway	285	,	the	perimeter	around	atlanta	,	which	encompasses	now	--	there	's	seven	lanes	,	she	's	on	all	of	them	,	y'all	.
i	said	,	``	ma	,	pick	a	lane	!	``
``	they	give	you	seven	lanes	,	they	expect	you	to	use	them	.	``
and	there	she	goes	,	right	.
i	do	n't	believe	for	a	minute	she	has	been	out	and	not	been	stopped	.
so	,	i	think	,	hey	,	we	can	talk	.	it	'll	be	a	diversion	.
it	'll	help	my	breathing	.	it	'll	do	something	for	my	pulse	,	maybe	.
``	mommy	,	i	know	you	have	been	stopped	.	``
``	no	,	no	,	what	you	talking	about	?	``
``	you	have	a	license	.	how	long	have	you	been	driving	?	``
``	four	or	five	days	.	``
``	yeah	.	and	you	have	n't	been	stopped	?	``
``	i	did	not	get	a	ticket	.	``
i	said	,	``	yeah	,	yeah	,	yeah	,	yeah	,	but	come	on	,	come	on	,	come	on	.	``
``	ok	,	so	i	stopped	at	a	light	and	there	's	a	guy	,	you	know	,	in	the	back	.	``
``	would	this	guy	have	,	like	,	a	blue	uniform	and	a	terrified	look	on	his	face	?	``
``	you	were	n't	there	,	do	n't	start	.	``
``	come	on	.	you	got	a	ticket	?	``
``	no.	``	she	explained	,	``	the	man	``	--	i	have	to	tell	you	as	she	did	,	because	it	loses	something	if	i	do	n't	,	you	know	--	``	he	come	to	the	window	,	and	he	does	a	thing	like	this	,	which	tells	me	he	's	pretty	old	,	you	know	.
so	i	look	up	and	i	'm	thinking	,	maybe	he	's	still	going	to	think	i	'm	kind	of	cute	.	``
``	ma	,	are	you	still	doing	that	?	``
``	if	it	works	,	it	works	,	baby	.
so	,	i	say	,	'	perdon	,	yo	no	hablo	ingles	.	'	well	,	would	n't	you	know	,	he	had	been	in	honduras	for	the	peace	corps	.	``
so	he	's	talking	to	her	,	and	at	some	point	she	says	,	``	then	,	you	know	,	it	was	it	.	that	was	it	.	it	was	done	.	``
``	yeah	?	what	?
he	gave	you	a	ticket	?	he	did	n't	give	you	a	ticket	?	what	?	``
``	no	,	i	look	up	,	and	the	light	,	she	change	.	``
you	should	be	terrified	.
now	,	i	do	n't	know	if	she	's	toying	with	me	,	kind	of	like	a	cat	batting	back	a	mouse	,	batting	back	a	mouse	--	left	paw	,	right	paw	,	left	paw	,	right	paw	--	but	by	now	,	we	've	reached	the	mall	.
now	,	you	have	all	been	at	a	mall	during	the	holidays	,	yes	?
talk	to	me	.	yes	.	yes	.	you	can	say	yes	.
audience	:	yes	.
carmen	agra	deedy	:	all	right	,	then	you	know	that	you	have	now	entered	parking	lot	purgatory	,	praying	to	that	saint	of	perpetual	availability	that	as	you	join	that	serpentine	line	of	cars	crawling	along	,	some	guy	's	going	to	turn	on	the	brake	lights	just	as	you	pull	up	behind	him	.
but	that	does	n't	happen	most	of	the	time	,	right	?
so	,	first	i	say	,	``	ma	,	why	are	we	here	?	``
``	you	mean	,	like	,	in	the	car	?	``
``	no	,	do	n't	--	why	are	we	here	today	?
it	's	saturday	.	it	's	the	holidays	.	``
``	because	i	have	to	exchange	your	father	's	underwear	.	``
now	,	see	,	this	is	the	kind	of	machiavellian	thinking	,	that	you	really	have	to	--	you	know	,	in	my	mind	,	it	's	a	rabbit	's	warren	,	this	woman	's	mind	.
do	i	want	to	walk	in	,	because	unless	i	have	ariadne	's	thread	to	anchor	--	enough	metaphors	for	you	?	--	somewhere	,	i	may	not	get	out	.
but	you	know	.
``	why	do	we	have	to	take	pop	's	underwear	back	now	?
and	why	?	what	is	wrong	with	his	underwear	?	``
``	it	will	upset	you	.	``
``	it	wo	n't	upset	me	.	why	?	what	?	is	something	wrong	with	him	?	``
``	no	,	no	,	no	.	the	only	thing	with	him	is	,	he	's	an	idiot	.
i	sent	him	to	the	store	,	which	was	my	first	mistake	,	and	he	went	to	buy	underwear	,	and	he	bought	the	grippers	,	and	he	's	supposed	to	buy	the	boxers	.	``
``	why	?	``
``	i	read	it	on	the	intersnet	.	you	can	not	have	children	.	``
``	oh	,	my	god	!	``
olivia	?	huh	?	huh	?
by	now	,	we	have	now	crawled	another	four	feet	,	and	my	mother	finally	says	to	me	,	``	i	knew	it	,	i	knew	it	.
i	'm	an	immigrant	.	we	make	a	space	.	what	i	tell	you	?	right	there	.	``
and	she	points	out	the	passenger	window	,	and	i	look	out	,	and	three	--	three	--	aisles	down	,	``	look	,	the	chevy	.	``
you	want	to	laugh	,	but	you	do	n't	know	--	you	're	that	politically	corrected	,	have	you	noticed	?
correct	the	other	direction	now	,	it	's	ok	.
``	look	,	the	chevy	--	he	's	coming	this	way	.	``
``	mama	,	mama	,	mama	,	wait	,	wait	,	wait	.	the	chevy	is	three	aisles	away	.	``
she	looks	at	me	like	i	'm	her	,	you	know	,	her	moron	child	,	the	cretin	,	the	one	she	's	got	to	speak	to	very	slowly	and	distinctly	.
``	i	know	that	,	honey	.	get	out	of	the	car	and	go	stand	in	the	parking	space	till	i	get	there	.	``
ok	,	i	want	a	vote	.	come	on	,	come	on	.	no	,	no	.
how	many	of	you	once	in	your	--	you	were	a	kid	,	you	were	an	adult	--	you	stood	in	a	parking	space	to	hold	it	for	someone	?
see	,	we	're	a	secret	club	with	a	secret	handshake	.
and	years	of	therapy	later	,	we	're	doing	great	.
we	're	doing	great	.	we	're	doing	fine	.
well	,	i	stood	up	to	her	.
this	is	--	you	know	,	you	'd	think	by	now	i	'm	--	and	still	holding	?
i	said	,	``	no	way	,	ma	,	you	have	embarrassed	me	my	entire	life	.	``
of	course	,	her	comeback	is	,	``	when	have	i	embarrassed	you	?	``
and	she	's	still	talking	while	she	puts	the	car	in	park	,	hits	the	emergency	brake	,	opens	the	door	,	and	with	a	spryness	astounding	in	a	woman	her	age	,	she	jumps	out	of	the	car	,	knocks	out	the	phone	books	,	and	then	she	walks	around	--	she	's	carrying	her	cheap	kmart	purse	with	her	--	around	the	front	of	the	car	.
she	has	amazing	land	speed	for	a	woman	her	age	,	too	.
before	i	know	it	,	she	has	skiddled	across	the	parking	lot	and	in	between	the	cars	,	and	people	behind	me	,	with	that	kind	of	usual	religious	charity	that	the	holidays	bring	us	,	wah	-	wah	wah	-	wah	.
``	i	'm	coming	.	``	italian	hand	signals	follow	.
i	scoot	over	.	i	close	the	door	.	i	leave	the	phone	books	.
this	is	new	and	fast	,	just	so	you	--	are	you	still	with	us	?
we	'll	wait	for	the	slow	ones	.	ok	.
i	start	,	and	this	is	where	a	child	says	to	me	--	and	the	story	does	n't	work	if	i	tell	you	about	her	before	,	because	this	is	my	laconic	child	.
a	brevity	,	brevity	of	everything	with	this	child	.
you	know	,	she	eats	small	portions	.
language	is	something	to	be	meted	out	in	small	phonemes	,	you	know	--	just	little	hmm	,	hmm	-	hmm	.
she	carries	a	mean	spiral	notebook	and	a	pen	.
she	wields	great	power	.
she	listens	,	because	that	's	what	people	who	tell	stories	do	first	.
but	she	pauses	occasionally	and	says	,	``	how	do	you	spell	that	?	what	year	?	ok	.	``
when	she	writes	the	expose	in	about	20	years	,	do	n't	believe	a	word	of	it	.
but	this	is	my	daughter	,	lauren	,	my	remarkable	daughter	,	my	borderline	asperger	's	kid	.
bless	you	,	dr.	watson	.
she	says	,	``	ma	,	you	got	to	look	!	``
now	,	when	this	kid	says	i	got	to	look	,	you	know	.
but	it	is	n't	like	i	have	n't	seen	this	crime	scene	before	.
i	grew	up	with	this	woman	.
i	said	,	``	lauren	,	you	know	what	,	give	me	a	play	-	by	-	play	.	i	ca	n't	.	``
``	no	,	mama	,	you	got	to	look	.	``
i	got	to	look	.	you	got	to	look	.
do	n't	you	want	to	look	?
there	she	is	.
i	look	in	bewildered	awe	:	she	's	standing	,	those	rockports	slightly	apart	,	but	grounded	.
she	's	holding	out	that	cheap	kmart	purse	,	and	she	is	wielding	it	.
she	's	holding	back	tons	of	steel	with	the	sheer	force	of	her	little	personality	,	in	that	crone	-	ish	voice	,	saying	things	like	,	``	back	it	up	,	buddy	!	no	,	it	's	reserved	!	``
ready	?	brace	yourselves	.	here	it	comes	.
``	no	,	my	daughter	,	she	's	coming	in	the	buick	.
honey	,	sit	up	so	they	can	see	you	.	``
oh	,	jesus	.	oh	,	jesus	.
i	finally	come	--	and	now	,	it	's	the	south	.
i	do	n't	know	what	part	of	the	country	you	live	in	.
i	think	we	all	secretly	love	stories	.
we	all	secretly	want	our	blankie	and	our	boo	bear	.
we	want	to	curl	up	and	say	,	``	tell	it	to	me	,	tell	it	to	me	.
come	on	,	honey	,	tell	it	to	me	.	``
but	in	the	south	,	we	love	a	good	story	.
people	have	pulled	aside	,	i	mean	,	they	've	come	out	of	that	queue	line	,	they	have	popped	their	trunks	,	pulled	out	lawn	chairs	and	cool	drinks	.
bets	are	placed	.
``	i	'm	with	the	little	lady	.	damn	!	``
and	she	's	bringing	me	in	with	a	slight	salsa	movement	.
she	is	,	after	all	,	cuban	.
i	'm	thinking	,	``	accelerator	,	break	.	accelerator	,	break	.	``
like	you	've	never	thought	that	in	your	life	?	right	?	yeah	.
i	pull	in	.	i	put	the	car	in	park	.
engine	's	still	running	--	mine	,	not	the	car	.
i	jump	out	next	to	her	going	,	``	do	n't	you	move	!	``
``	i	'm	not	going	anywhere	.	``
she	's	got	front	seat	in	a	greek	tragedy	.
i	come	out	,	and	there	's	esther	.
she	's	hugging	the	purse	.
``	que	?	``	which	means	``	what	,	``	and	so	much	more	.
``	ma	,	have	you	no	shame	?
people	are	watching	us	all	around	,	``	right	?
now	,	some	of	them	you	've	got	to	make	up	,	people	.
secret	of	the	trade	.
guess	what	?	some	of	these	stories	i	sculpt	a	little	,	here	and	there	.
some	,	they	're	just	right	there	,	right	there	.	put	them	right	there	.
she	says	this	to	me	.
after	i	say	--	let	me	refresh	you	--	``	have	you	no	shame	?	``
``	no	.	i	gave	it	up	with	pantyhose	--	they	're	both	too	binding	.	``
yeah	,	you	can	clap	,	but	then	you	're	about	30	seconds	from	the	end	.
i	'm	about	to	snap	like	a	brittle	twig	,	when	suddenly	someone	taps	me	on	the	shoulder	.
intrepid	soul	.
i	'm	thinking	,	``	this	is	my	kid	.	how	dare	she	?
she	jumped	out	of	that	car	.	``
that	's	ok	,	because	my	mother	yells	at	me	,	i	yell	at	her	.
it	's	a	beautiful	hierarchy	,	and	it	works	.
i	turn	around	,	but	it	's	not	a	child	.	it	's	a	young	woman	,	a	little	taller	than	i	,	pale	green	,	amused	eyes	.
with	her	is	a	young	man	--	husband	,	brother	,	lover	,	it	's	not	my	job	.
and	she	says	,	``	pardon	me	,	ma'am	``	--	that	's	how	we	talk	down	there	--	``	is	that	your	mother	?	``
i	said	,	``	no	,	i	follow	little	old	women	around	parking	lots	to	see	if	they	'll	stop	.	yes	,	it	's	my	mother	!	``
the	boy	,	now	,	he	says	.	``	well	,	what	my	sister	meant	``	--	they	look	at	each	other	,	it	's	a	knowing	glance	--	``	god	,	she	's	crazy	!	``
i	said	,	,	and	the	young	girl	and	the	young	boy	say	,	``	no	,	no	,	honey	,	we	just	want	to	know	one	more	thing	.	``
i	said	,	``	look	,	please	,	let	me	take	care	of	her	,	ok	,	because	i	know	her	,	and	believe	me	,	she	's	like	a	small	atomic	weapon	,	you	know	,	you	just	want	to	handle	her	really	gingerly	.	``
and	the	girl	goes	,	``	i	know	,	but	,	i	mean	,	i	swear	to	god	,	she	reminds	us	of	our	mother	.	``
i	almost	miss	it	.
he	turns	to	her	on	the	heel	of	his	shoe	.
it	's	a	half	-	whisper	,	``	god	,	i	miss	her	.	``
they	turn	then	,	shoulder	to	shoulder	,	and	walk	away	,	lost	in	their	own	reverie	.
memories	of	some	maddening	woman	who	was	the	luck	of	their	dna	draw	.
and	i	turn	to	esther	,	who	's	rocking	on	those	'	ports	,	and	says	,	``	you	know	what	,	honey	?	``
``	what	,	ma	?	``
``	i	'm	going	to	drive	you	crazy	probably	for	about	14	,	15	more	years	,	if	you	're	lucky	,	but	after	that	,	honey	,	you	're	going	to	miss	me	.	``
