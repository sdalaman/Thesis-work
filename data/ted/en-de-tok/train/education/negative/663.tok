the	magical	moment	,	the	magical	moment	of	conducting	.
which	is	,	you	go	onto	a	stage	.	there	is	an	orchestra	sitting	.
they	are	all	,	you	know	,	warming	up	and	doing	stuff	.
and	i	go	on	the	podium	.
you	know	,	this	little	office	of	the	conductor	.
or	rather	a	cubicle	,	an	open	-	space	cubicle	,	with	a	lot	of	space	.
and	in	front	of	all	that	noise	,	you	do	a	very	small	gesture	.
something	like	this	,	not	very	pomp	,	not	very	sophisticated	,	this	.
and	suddenly	,	out	of	the	chaos	,	order	.
noise	becomes	music	.
and	this	is	fantastic	.	and	it	's	so	tempting	to	think	that	it	's	all	about	me	.
all	those	great	people	here	,	virtuosos	,	they	make	noise	,	they	need	me	to	do	that	.
not	really	.	if	it	were	that	,	i	would	just	save	you	the	talk	,	and	teach	you	the	gesture	.
so	you	could	go	out	to	the	world	and	do	this	thing	in	whatever	company	or	whatever	you	want	,	and	you	have	perfect	harmony	.	it	does	n't	work	.
let	's	look	at	the	first	video	.
i	hope	you	'll	think	it	's	a	good	example	of	harmony	.
and	then	speak	a	little	bit	about	how	it	comes	about	.
was	that	nice	?
so	that	was	a	sort	of	a	success	.
now	,	who	should	we	thank	for	the	success	?
i	mean	,	obviously	the	orchestra	musicians	playing	beautifully	,	the	vienna	philharmonic	orchestra	.
they	do	n't	often	even	look	at	the	conductor	.
then	you	have	the	clapping	audience	,	yeah	,	actually	taking	part	in	doing	the	music	.
you	know	viennese	audiences	usually	do	n't	interfere	with	the	music	.
this	is	the	closest	to	an	oriental	bellydancing	feast	that	you	will	ever	get	in	vienna	.
unlike	,	for	example	israel	,	where	audiences	cough	all	the	time	.
you	know	,	arthur	rubinstein	,	the	pianist	,	used	to	say	that	,	``	anywhere	in	the	world	,	people	that	have	the	flu	,	they	go	to	the	doctor	.
in	tel	aviv	they	come	to	my	concerts	.	``
so	that	's	a	sort	of	a	tradition	.
but	viennese	audiences	do	not	do	that	.
here	they	go	out	of	their	regular	,	just	to	be	part	of	that	,	to	become	part	of	the	orchestra	,	and	that	's	great	.
you	know	,	audiences	like	you	,	yeah	,	make	the	event	.
but	what	about	the	conductor	?	what	can	you	say	the	conductor	was	doing	,	actually	?
um	,	he	was	happy	.
and	i	often	show	this	to	senior	management	.
people	get	annoyed	.
``	you	come	to	work	.	how	come	you	're	so	happy	?	``
something	must	be	wrong	there	,	yeah	?	but	he	's	spreading	happiness	.
and	i	think	the	happiness	,	the	important	thing	is	this	happiness	does	not	come	from	only	his	own	story	and	his	joy	of	the	music	.
the	joy	is	about	enabling	other	people	's	stories	to	be	heard	at	the	same	time	.
you	have	the	story	of	the	orchestra	as	a	professional	body	.
you	have	the	story	of	the	audience	as	a	community	.	yeah	.
you	have	the	stories	of	the	individuals	in	the	orchestra	and	in	the	audience	.
and	then	you	have	other	stories	,	unseen	.
people	who	build	this	wonderful	concert	hall	.
people	who	made	those	stradivarius	,	amati	,	all	those	beautiful	instruments	.
and	all	those	stories	are	being	heard	at	the	same	time	.
this	is	the	true	experience	of	a	live	concert	.
that	's	a	reason	to	go	out	of	home	.	yeah	?
and	not	all	conductors	do	just	that	.
let	's	see	somebody	else	,	a	great	conductor	.
riccardo	muti	,	please	.
yeah	,	that	was	very	short	,	but	you	could	see	it	's	a	completely	different	figure	.	right	?
he	's	awesome	.	he	's	so	commanding	.	yeah	?
so	clear	.	maybe	a	little	bit	over	-	clear	.
can	we	have	a	little	demonstration	?	would	you	be	my	orchestra	for	a	second	?
can	you	sing	,	please	,	the	first	note	of	don	giovanni	?
you	have	to	sing	``	aaaaaah	,	``	and	i	'll	stop	you	.
okay	?	ready	?
audience	:	♫	aaaaaaah	...	♫	itay	talgam	:	come	on	,	with	me	.	if	you	do	it	without	me	i	feel	even	more	redundant	than	i	already	feel	.
so	please	,	wait	for	the	conductor	.
now	look	at	me	.	``	aaaaaah	,	``	and	i	stop	you	.	let	's	go	.
audience	:	♫	...	aaaaaaaah	...	♫	itay	talgam	:	so	we	'll	have	a	little	chat	later	.
but	...	there	is	a	vacancy	for	a	...
but	--	--	you	could	see	that	you	could	stop	an	orchestra	with	a	finger	.
now	what	does	riccardo	muti	do	?	he	does	something	like	this	...
and	then	--	sort	of	--	so	not	only	the	instruction	is	clear	,	but	also	the	sanction	,	what	will	happen	if	you	do	n't	do	what	i	tell	you	.
so	,	does	it	work	?	yes	,	it	works	--	to	a	certain	point	.
when	muti	is	asked	,	``	why	do	you	conduct	like	this	?	``
he	says	,	``	i	'm	responsible	.	``
responsible	in	front	of	him	.
no	he	does	n't	really	mean	him	.	he	means	mozart	,	which	is	--	--	like	a	third	seat	from	the	center	.
so	he	says	,	``	if	i	'm	--	if	i	'm	responsible	for	mozart	,	this	is	going	to	be	the	only	story	to	be	told	.
it	's	mozart	as	i	,	riccardo	muti	,	understand	it	.	``
and	you	know	what	happened	to	muti	?
three	years	ago	he	got	a	letter	signed	by	all	700	employees	of	la	scala	,	musical	employees	,	i	mean	the	musicians	,	saying	,	``	you	're	a	great	conductor	.	we	do	n't	want	to	work	with	you	.	please	resign	.	``
``	why	?	because	you	do	n't	let	us	develop	.
you	're	using	us	as	instruments	,	not	as	partners	.
and	our	joy	of	music	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	.	.	.	``
so	he	had	to	resign	.	is	n't	that	nice	?
he	's	a	nice	guy	.	he	's	a	really	nice	guy	.
well	,	can	you	do	it	with	less	control	,	or	with	a	different	kind	of	control	?
let	's	look	at	the	next	conductor	,	richard	strauss	.
i	'm	afraid	you	'll	get	the	feeling	that	i	really	picked	on	him	because	he	's	old	.
it	's	not	true	.	when	he	was	a	young	man	of	about	30	,	he	wrote	what	he	called	``	the	ten	commandments	for	conductors	.	``
the	first	one	was	:	if	you	sweat	by	the	end	of	the	concert	it	means	that	you	must	have	done	something	wrong	.
that	's	the	first	one	.	the	fourth	one	you	'll	like	better	.
it	says	:	never	look	at	the	trombones	--	it	only	encourages	them	.
so	,	the	whole	idea	is	really	to	let	it	happen	by	itself	.
do	not	interfere	.
but	how	does	it	happen	?	did	you	see	him	turning	pages	in	the	score	?
now	,	either	he	is	senile	,	and	does	n't	remember	his	own	music	,	because	he	wrote	the	music	.
or	he	is	actually	transferring	a	very	strong	message	to	them	,	saying	,	``	come	on	guys	.	you	have	to	play	by	the	book	.
so	it	's	not	about	my	story	.	it	's	not	about	your	story	.
it	's	only	the	execution	of	the	written	music	,	no	interpretation	.	``
interpretation	is	the	real	story	of	the	performer	.
so	,	no	,	he	does	n't	want	that	.	that	's	a	different	kind	of	control	.
let	's	see	another	super	-	conductor	,	a	german	super	-	conductor	.	herbert	von	karajan	,	please	.
what	's	different	?	did	you	see	the	eyes	?	closed	.
did	you	see	the	hands	?
did	you	see	this	kind	of	movement	?	let	me	conduct	you	.	twice	.
once	like	a	muti	,	and	you	'll	--	--	clap	,	just	once	.
and	then	like	karajan	.	let	's	see	what	happens	.	okay	?
like	muti	.	you	ready	?	because	muti	...
okay	?	ready	?	let	's	do	it	.
audience	:	itay	talgam	:	hmm	...	again	.
audience	:	itay	talgam	:	good	.	now	like	a	karajan	.	since	you	're	already	trained	,	let	me	concentrate	,	close	my	eyes	.	come	,	come	.
audience	:	itay	talgam	:	why	not	together	?
because	you	did	n't	know	when	to	play	.
now	i	can	tell	you	,	even	the	berlin	philharmonic	does	n't	know	when	to	play	.
but	i	'll	tell	you	how	they	do	it	.	no	cynicism	.
this	is	a	german	orchestra	,	yes	?
they	look	at	karajan	.	and	then	they	look	at	each	other	.
``	do	you	understand	what	this	guy	wants	?	``
and	after	doing	that	,	they	really	look	at	each	other	,	and	the	first	players	of	the	orchestra	lead	the	whole	ensemble	in	playing	together	.
and	when	karajan	is	asked	about	it	he	actually	says	,	``	yes	,	the	worst	damage	i	can	do	to	my	orchestra	is	to	give	them	a	clear	instruction	.
because	that	would	prevent	the	ensemble	,	the	listening	to	each	other	that	is	needed	for	an	orchestra	.	``
now	that	's	great	.	what	about	the	eyes	?
why	are	the	eyes	closed	?
there	is	a	wonderful	story	about	karajan	conducting	in	london	.
and	he	cues	in	a	flute	player	like	this	.
the	guy	has	no	idea	what	to	do	.
``	maestro	,	with	all	due	respect	,	when	should	i	start	?	``
what	do	you	think	karajan	's	reply	was	?	when	should	i	start	?
oh	yeah	.	he	says	,	``	you	start	when	you	ca	n't	stand	it	anymore	.	``
meaning	that	you	know	you	have	no	authority	to	change	anything	.
it	's	my	music	.	the	real	music	is	only	in	karajan	's	head	.
and	you	have	to	guess	my	mind	.	so	you	are	under	tremendous	pressure	because	i	do	n't	give	you	instruction	,	and	yet	,	you	have	to	guess	my	mind	.
so	it	's	a	different	kind	of	,	a	very	spiritual	but	yet	very	firm	control	.
can	we	do	it	in	another	way	?	of	course	we	can	.	let	's	go	back	to	the	first	conductor	we	've	seen	:	carlos	kleiber	,	his	name	.	next	video	,	please	.
yeah	.
well	,	it	is	different	.	but	is	n't	that	controlling	in	the	same	way	?
no	,	it	's	not	,	because	he	is	not	telling	them	what	to	do	.
when	he	does	this	,	it	's	not	,	``	take	your	stradivarius	and	like	jimi	hendrix	,	smash	it	on	the	floor	.	``	it	's	not	that	.
he	says	,	``	this	is	the	gesture	of	the	music	.
i	'm	opening	a	space	for	you	to	put	in	another	layer	of	interpretation	.	``
that	is	another	story	.
but	how	does	it	really	work	together	if	it	does	n't	give	them	instructions	?
it	's	like	being	on	a	rollercoaster	.	yeah	?
you	're	not	really	given	any	instructions	,	but	the	forces	of	the	process	itself	keep	you	in	place	.
that	's	what	he	does	.
the	interesting	thing	is	of	course	the	rollercoaster	does	not	really	exist	.
it	's	not	a	physical	thing	.	it	's	in	the	players	'	heads	.
and	that	's	what	makes	them	into	partners	.
you	have	the	plan	in	your	head	.
you	know	what	to	do	,	even	though	kleiber	is	not	conducting	you	.
but	here	and	there	and	that	.	you	know	what	to	do	.
and	you	become	a	partner	building	the	rollercoaster	,	yeah	,	with	sound	,	as	you	actually	take	the	ride	.
this	is	very	exciting	for	those	players	.
they	do	need	to	go	to	a	sanatorium	for	two	weeks	,	later	.
it	is	very	tiring	.	yeah	?
but	it	's	the	best	music	making	,	like	this	.
but	of	course	it	's	not	only	about	motivation	and	giving	them	a	lot	of	physical	energy	.
you	also	have	to	be	very	professional	.
and	look	again	at	this	kleiber	.
can	we	have	the	next	video	,	quickly	?
you	'll	see	what	happens	when	there	is	a	mistake	.
again	you	see	the	beautiful	body	language	.
and	now	there	is	a	trumpet	player	who	does	something	not	exactly	the	way	it	should	be	done	.
go	along	with	the	video	.	look	.
see	,	second	time	for	the	same	player	.
and	now	the	third	time	for	the	same	player	.
``	wait	for	me	after	the	concert	.
i	have	a	short	notice	to	give	you	.	``
you	know	,	when	it	's	needed	,	the	authority	is	there	.	it	's	very	important	.
but	authority	is	not	enough	to	make	people	your	partners	.
let	's	see	the	next	video	,	please	.	see	what	happens	here	.
you	might	be	surprised	having	seen	kleiber	as	such	a	hyperactive	guy	.
he	's	conducting	mozart	.
the	whole	orchestra	is	playing	.
now	something	else	.
see	?	he	is	there	100	percent	,	but	not	commanding	,	not	telling	what	to	do	.
rather	enjoying	what	the	soloist	is	doing	.
another	solo	now	.	see	what	you	can	pick	up	from	this	.
look	at	the	eyes	.
okay	.	you	see	that	?
first	of	all	,	it	's	a	kind	of	a	compliment	we	all	like	to	get	.
it	's	not	feedback	.	it	's	an	``	mmmm	.	.	.	``	yeah	,	it	comes	from	here	.
so	that	's	a	good	thing	.
and	the	second	thing	is	it	's	about	actually	being	in	control	,	but	in	a	very	special	way	.
when	kleiber	does	--	did	you	see	the	eyes	,	going	from	here	?
you	know	what	happens	?	gravitation	is	no	more	.
kleiber	not	only	creates	a	process	,	but	also	creates	the	conditions	in	the	world	in	which	this	process	takes	place	.
so	again	,	the	oboe	player	is	completely	autonomous	and	therefore	happy	and	proud	of	his	work	,	and	creative	and	all	of	that	.
and	the	level	in	which	kleiber	is	in	control	is	in	a	different	level	.
so	control	is	no	longer	a	zero	-	sum	game	.
you	have	this	control	.	you	have	this	control	.	and	all	you	put	together	,	in	partnership	,	brings	about	the	best	music	.
so	kleiber	is	about	process	.
kleiber	is	about	conditions	in	the	world	.
but	you	need	to	have	process	and	content	to	create	the	meaning	.
lenny	bernstein	,	my	own	personal	maestro	.
since	he	was	a	great	teacher	,	lenny	bernstein	always	started	from	the	meaning	.	look	at	this	,	please	.
do	you	remember	the	face	of	muti	,	at	the	beginning	?
well	he	had	a	wonderful	expression	,	but	only	one	.
did	you	see	lenny	's	face	?
you	know	why	?	because	the	meaning	of	the	music	is	pain	.
and	you	're	playing	a	painful	sound	.
and	you	look	at	lenny	and	he	's	suffering	.
but	not	in	a	way	that	you	want	to	stop	.
it	's	suffering	,	like	,	enjoying	himself	in	a	jewish	way	,	as	they	say	.
but	you	can	see	the	music	on	his	face	.
you	can	see	the	baton	left	his	hand	.	no	more	baton	.
now	it	's	about	you	,	the	player	,	telling	the	story	.
now	it	's	a	reversed	thing	.	you	're	telling	the	story	.	and	you	're	telling	the	story	.
and	even	briefly	,	you	become	the	storyteller	to	which	the	community	,	the	whole	community	,	listens	to	.
and	bernstein	enables	that	.	is	n't	that	wonderful	?
now	,	if	you	are	doing	all	the	things	we	talked	about	,	together	,	and	maybe	some	others	,	you	can	get	to	this	wonderful	point	of	doing	without	doing	.
and	for	the	last	video	,	i	think	this	is	simply	the	best	title	.
my	friend	peter	says	,	``	if	you	love	something	,	give	it	away	.	``	so	,	please	.
