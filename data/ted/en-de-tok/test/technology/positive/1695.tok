chris	anderson	:	elon	,	what	kind	of	crazy	dream	would	persuade	you	to	think	of	trying	to	take	on	the	auto	industry	and	build	an	all	-	electric	car	?
elon	musk	:	well	,	it	goes	back	to	when	i	was	in	university	.
i	thought	about	,	what	are	the	problems	that	are	most	likely	to	affect	the	future	of	the	world	or	the	future	of	humanity	?
i	think	it	's	extremely	important	that	we	have	sustainable	transport	and	sustainable	energy	production	.
that	sort	of	overall	sustainable	energy	problem	is	the	biggest	problem	that	we	have	to	solve	this	century	,	independent	of	environmental	concerns	.
in	fact	,	even	if	producing	co	2	was	good	for	the	environment	,	given	that	we	're	going	to	run	out	of	hydrocarbons	,	we	need	to	find	some	sustainable	means	of	operating	.
ca	:	most	of	american	electricity	comes	from	burning	fossil	fuels	.
how	can	an	electric	car	that	plugs	into	that	electricity	help	?
em	:	right	.	there	's	two	elements	to	that	answer	.
one	is	that	,	even	if	you	take	the	same	source	fuel	and	produce	power	at	the	power	plant	and	use	it	to	charge	electric	cars	,	you	're	still	better	off	.
so	if	you	take	,	say	,	natural	gas	,	which	is	the	most	prevalent	hydrocarbon	source	fuel	,	if	you	burn	that	in	a	modern	general	electric	natural	gas	turbine	,	you	'll	get	about	60	percent	efficiency	.
if	you	put	that	same	fuel	in	an	internal	combustion	engine	car	,	you	get	about	20	percent	efficiency	.
and	the	reason	is	,	in	the	stationary	power	plant	,	you	can	afford	to	have	something	that	weighs	a	lot	more	,	is	voluminous	,	and	you	can	take	the	waste	heat	and	run	a	steam	turbine	and	generate	a	secondary	power	source	.
so	in	effect	,	even	after	you	've	taken	transmission	loss	into	account	and	everything	,	even	using	the	same	source	fuel	,	you	're	at	least	twice	as	better	off	charging	an	electric	car	,	then	burning	it	at	the	power	plant	.
ca	:	that	scale	delivers	efficiency	.
em	:	yes	,	it	does	.
and	then	the	other	point	is	,	we	have	to	have	sustainable	means	of	power	generation	anyway	,	electricity	generation	.
so	given	that	we	have	to	solve	sustainable	electricity	generation	,	then	it	makes	sense	for	us	to	have	electric	cars	as	the	mode	of	transport	.
ca	:	so	we	've	got	some	video	here	of	the	tesla	being	assembled	,	which	,	if	we	could	play	that	first	video	--	so	what	is	innovative	about	this	process	in	this	vehicle	?
em	:	sure	.	so	,	in	order	to	accelerate	the	advent	of	electric	transport	,	and	i	should	say	that	i	think	,	actually	,	all	modes	of	transport	will	become	fully	electric	with	the	ironic	exception	of	rockets	.
there	's	just	no	way	around	newton	's	third	law	.
the	question	is	how	do	you	accelerate	the	advent	of	electric	transport	?
and	in	order	to	do	that	for	cars	,	you	have	to	come	up	with	a	really	energy	efficient	car	,	so	that	means	making	it	incredibly	light	,	and	so	what	you	're	seeing	here	is	the	only	all	-	aluminum	body	and	chassis	car	made	in	north	america	.
in	fact	,	we	applied	a	lot	of	rocket	design	techniques	to	make	the	car	light	despite	having	a	very	large	battery	pack	.
and	then	it	also	has	the	lowest	drag	coefficient	of	any	car	of	its	size	.
so	as	a	result	,	the	energy	usage	is	very	low	,	and	it	has	the	most	advanced	battery	pack	,	and	that	's	what	gives	it	the	range	that	's	competitive	,	so	you	can	actually	have	on	the	order	of	a	250	-	mile	range	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	those	battery	packs	are	incredibly	heavy	,	but	you	think	the	math	can	still	work	out	intelligently	--	by	combining	light	body	,	heavy	battery	,	you	can	still	gain	spectacular	efficiency	.
em	:	exactly	.	the	rest	of	the	car	has	to	be	very	light	to	offset	the	mass	of	the	pack	,	and	then	you	have	to	have	a	low	drag	coefficient	so	that	you	have	good	highway	range	.
and	in	fact	,	customers	of	the	model	s	are	sort	of	competing	with	each	other	to	try	to	get	the	highest	possible	range	.
i	think	somebody	recently	got	420	miles	out	of	a	single	charge	.
ca	:	bruno	bowden	,	who	's	here	,	did	that	,	broke	the	world	record	.	em	:	congratulations	.
ca	:	that	was	the	good	news	.	the	bad	news	was	that	to	do	it	,	he	had	to	drive	at	18	miles	an	hour	constant	speed	and	got	pulled	over	by	the	cops	.
em	:	i	mean	,	you	can	certainly	drive	--	if	you	drive	it	65	miles	an	hour	,	under	normal	conditions	,	250	miles	is	a	reasonable	number	.
ca	:	let	's	show	that	second	video	showing	the	tesla	in	action	on	ice	.
not	at	all	a	dig	at	the	new	york	times	,	this	,	by	the	way	.
what	is	the	most	surprising	thing	about	the	experience	of	driving	the	car	?
em	:	in	creating	an	electric	car	,	the	responsiveness	of	the	car	is	really	incredible	.
so	we	wanted	really	to	have	people	feel	as	though	they	've	almost	got	to	mind	meld	with	the	car	,	so	you	just	feel	like	you	and	the	car	are	kind	of	one	,	and	as	you	corner	and	accelerate	,	it	just	happens	,	like	the	car	has	esp	.
you	can	do	that	with	an	electric	car	because	of	its	responsiveness	.
you	ca	n't	do	that	with	a	gasoline	car	.
i	think	that	's	really	a	profound	difference	,	and	people	only	experience	that	when	they	have	a	test	drive	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	this	is	a	beautiful	but	expensive	car	.
is	there	a	road	map	where	this	becomes	a	mass	-	market	vehicle	?
em	:	yeah	.	the	goal	of	tesla	has	always	been	to	have	a	sort	of	three	-	step	process	,	where	version	one	was	an	expensive	car	at	low	volume	,	version	two	is	medium	priced	and	medium	volume	,	and	then	version	three	would	be	low	price	,	high	volume	.
so	we	're	at	step	two	at	this	point	.
so	we	had	a	$	100,000	sports	car	,	which	was	the	roadster	.
then	we	've	got	the	model	s	,	which	starts	at	around	50,000	dollars	.
and	our	third	generation	car	,	which	should	hopefully	be	out	in	about	three	or	four	years	will	be	a	$	30,000	car	.
but	whenever	you	've	got	really	new	technology	,	it	generally	takes	about	three	major	versions	in	order	to	make	it	a	compelling	mass	-	market	product	.
and	so	i	think	we	're	making	progress	in	that	direction	,	and	i	feel	confident	that	we	'll	get	there	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	right	now	,	if	you	've	got	a	short	commute	,	you	can	drive	,	you	can	get	back	,	you	can	charge	it	at	home	.
there	is	n't	a	huge	nationwide	network	of	charging	stations	now	that	are	fast	.
do	you	see	that	coming	,	really	,	truly	,	or	just	on	a	few	key	routes	?
em	:	there	actually	are	far	more	charging	stations	than	people	realize	,	and	at	tesla	we	developed	something	called	a	supercharging	technology	,	and	we	're	offering	that	if	you	buy	a	model	s	for	free	,	forever	.
and	so	this	is	something	that	maybe	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	realize	.
we	actually	have	california	and	nevada	covered	,	and	we	've	got	the	eastern	seaboard	from	boston	to	d.c.	covered	.
by	the	end	of	this	year	,	you	'll	be	able	to	drive	from	l.a.	to	new	york	just	using	the	supercharger	network	,	which	charges	at	five	times	the	rate	of	anything	else	.
and	the	key	thing	is	to	have	a	ratio	of	drive	to	stop	,	to	stop	time	,	of	about	six	or	seven	.
so	if	you	drive	for	three	hours	,	you	want	to	stop	for	20	or	30	minutes	,	because	that	's	normally	what	people	will	stop	for	.
so	if	you	start	a	trip	at	9	a.m.	,	by	noon	you	want	to	stop	to	have	a	bite	to	eat	,	hit	the	restroom	,	coffee	,	and	keep	going	.
ca	:	so	your	proposition	to	consumers	is	,	for	the	full	charge	,	it	could	take	an	hour	.
so	it	's	common	--	do	n't	expect	to	be	out	of	here	in	10	minutes	.
wait	for	an	hour	,	but	the	good	news	is	,	you	're	helping	save	the	planet	,	and	by	the	way	,	the	electricity	is	free	.	you	do	n't	pay	anything	.
em	:	actually	,	what	we	're	expecting	is	for	people	to	stop	for	about	20	to	30	minutes	,	not	for	an	hour	.
it	's	actually	better	to	drive	for	about	maybe	160	,	170	miles	and	then	stop	for	half	an	hour	and	then	keep	going	.
that	's	the	natural	cadence	of	a	trip	.
ca	:	all	right	.	so	this	is	only	one	string	to	your	energy	bow	.
you	've	been	working	on	this	solar	company	solarcity	.
what	's	unusual	about	that	?
em	:	well	,	as	i	mentioned	earlier	,	we	have	to	have	sustainable	electricity	production	as	well	as	consumption	,	so	i	'm	quite	confident	that	the	primary	means	of	power	generation	will	be	solar	.
i	mean	,	it	's	really	indirect	fusion	,	is	what	it	is	.
we	've	got	this	giant	fusion	generator	in	the	sky	called	the	sun	,	and	we	just	need	to	tap	a	little	bit	of	that	energy	for	purposes	of	human	civilization	.
what	most	people	know	but	do	n't	realize	they	know	is	that	the	world	is	almost	entirely	solar	-	powered	already	.
if	the	sun	was	n't	there	,	we	'd	be	a	frozen	ice	ball	at	three	degrees	kelvin	,	and	the	sun	powers	the	entire	system	of	precipitation	.
the	whole	ecosystem	is	solar	-	powered	.
ca	:	but	in	a	gallon	of	gasoline	,	you	have	,	effectively	,	thousands	of	years	of	sun	power	compressed	into	a	small	space	,	so	it	's	hard	to	make	the	numbers	work	right	now	on	solar	,	and	to	remotely	compete	with	,	for	example	,	natural	gas	,	fracked	natural	gas	.	how	are	you	going	to	build	a	business	here	?
em	:	well	actually	,	i	'm	confident	that	solar	will	beat	everything	,	hands	down	,	including	natural	gas	.
ca	:	how	?
em	:	it	must	,	actually	.	if	it	does	n't	,	we	're	in	deep	trouble	.
ca	:	but	you	're	not	selling	solar	panels	to	consumers	.
what	are	you	doing	?
em	:	no	,	we	actually	are	.	you	can	buy	a	solar	system	or	you	can	lease	a	solar	system	.
most	people	choose	to	lease	.
and	the	thing	about	solar	power	is	that	it	does	n't	have	any	feed	stock	or	operational	costs	,	so	once	it	's	installed	,	it	's	just	there	.
it	works	for	decades	.	it	'll	work	for	probably	a	century	.
so	therefore	,	the	key	thing	to	do	is	to	get	the	cost	of	that	initial	installation	low	,	and	then	get	the	cost	of	the	financing	low	,	because	that	interest	--	those	are	the	two	factors	that	drive	the	cost	of	solar	.
and	we	've	made	huge	progress	in	that	direction	,	and	that	's	why	i	'm	confident	we	'll	actually	beat	natural	gas	.
ca	:	so	your	current	proposition	to	consumers	is	,	do	n't	pay	so	much	up	front	.
em	:	zero	.	ca	:	pay	zero	up	front	.
we	will	install	panels	on	your	roof	.
you	will	then	pay	,	how	long	is	a	typical	lease	?
em	:	typical	leases	are	20	years	,	but	the	value	proposition	is	,	as	you	're	sort	of	alluding	to	,	quite	straightforward	.
it	's	no	money	down	,	and	your	utility	bill	decreases	.
pretty	good	deal	.
ca	:	so	that	seems	like	a	win	for	the	consumer	.
no	risk	,	you	'll	pay	less	than	you	're	paying	now	.
for	you	,	the	dream	here	then	is	that	--	i	mean	,	who	owns	the	electricity	from	those	panels	for	the	longer	term	?
i	mean	,	how	do	you	,	the	company	,	benefit	?
em	:	well	,	essentially	,	solarcity	raises	a	chunk	of	capital	from	say	,	a	company	or	a	bank	.
google	is	one	of	our	big	partners	here	.
and	they	have	an	expected	return	on	that	capital	.
with	that	capital	,	solarcity	purchases	and	installs	the	panel	on	the	roof	and	then	charges	the	homeowner	or	business	owner	a	monthly	lease	payment	,	which	is	less	than	the	utility	bill	.
ca	:	but	you	yourself	get	a	long	-	term	commercial	benefit	from	that	power	.
you	're	kind	of	building	a	new	type	of	distributed	utility	.
em	:	exactly	.	what	it	amounts	to	is	a	giant	distributed	utility	.
i	think	it	's	a	good	thing	,	because	utilities	have	been	this	monopoly	,	and	people	have	n't	had	any	choice	.
so	effectively	it	's	the	first	time	there	's	been	competition	for	this	monopoly	,	because	the	utilities	have	been	the	only	ones	that	owned	those	power	distribution	lines	,	but	now	it	's	on	your	roof	.
so	i	think	it	's	actually	very	empowering	for	homeowners	and	businesses	.
ca	:	and	you	really	picture	a	future	where	a	majority	of	power	in	america	,	within	a	decade	or	two	,	or	within	your	lifetime	,	it	goes	solar	?
em	:	i	'm	extremely	confident	that	solar	will	be	at	least	a	plurality	of	power	,	and	most	likely	a	majority	,	and	i	predict	it	will	be	a	plurality	in	less	than	20	years	.
i	made	that	bet	with	someone	--	ca	:	definition	of	plurality	is	?
em	:	more	from	solar	than	any	other	source	.
ca	:	ah	.	who	did	you	make	the	bet	with	?
em	:	with	a	friend	who	will	remain	nameless	.
ca	:	just	between	us	.
em	:	i	made	that	bet	,	i	think	,	two	or	three	years	ago	,	so	in	roughly	18	years	,	i	think	we	'll	see	more	power	from	solar	than	any	other	source	.
ca	:	all	right	,	so	let	's	go	back	to	another	bet	that	you	made	with	yourself	,	i	guess	,	a	kind	of	crazy	bet	.
you	'd	made	some	money	from	the	sale	of	paypal	.
you	decided	to	build	a	space	company	.
why	on	earth	would	someone	do	that	?
em	:	i	got	that	question	a	lot	,	that	's	true	.
people	would	say	,	``	did	you	hear	the	joke	about	the	guy	who	made	a	small	fortune	in	the	space	industry	?	``
obviously	,	``	he	started	with	a	large	one	,	``	is	the	punchline	.
and	so	i	tell	people	,	well	,	i	was	trying	to	figure	out	the	fastest	way	to	turn	a	large	fortune	into	a	small	one	.
and	they	'd	look	at	me	,	like	,	``	is	he	serious	?	``
ca	:	and	strangely	,	you	were	.	so	what	happened	?
em	:	it	was	a	close	call	.	things	almost	did	n't	work	out	.
we	came	very	close	to	failure	,	but	we	managed	to	get	through	that	point	in	2008	.
the	goal	of	spacex	is	to	try	to	advance	rocket	technology	,	and	in	particular	to	try	to	crack	a	problem	that	i	think	is	vital	for	humanity	to	become	a	space	-	faring	civilization	,	which	is	to	have	a	rapidly	and	fully	reusable	rocket	.
ca	:	would	humanity	become	a	space	-	faring	civilization	?
so	that	was	a	dream	of	yours	,	in	a	way	,	from	a	young	age	?
you	've	dreamed	of	mars	and	beyond	?
em	:	i	did	build	rockets	when	i	was	a	kid	,	but	i	did	n't	think	i	'd	be	involved	in	this	.
it	was	really	more	from	the	standpoint	of	what	are	the	things	that	need	to	happen	in	order	for	the	future	to	be	an	exciting	and	inspiring	one	?
and	i	really	think	there	's	a	fundamental	difference	,	if	you	sort	of	look	into	the	future	,	between	a	humanity	that	is	a	space	-	faring	civilization	,	that	's	out	there	exploring	the	stars	,	on	multiple	planets	,	and	i	think	that	's	really	exciting	,	compared	with	one	where	we	are	forever	confined	to	earth	until	some	eventual	extinction	event	.
ca	:	so	you	've	somehow	slashed	the	cost	of	building	a	rocket	by	75	percent	,	depending	on	how	you	calculate	it	.
how	on	earth	have	you	done	that	?
nasa	has	been	doing	this	for	years	.	how	have	you	done	this	?
em	:	well	,	we	've	made	significant	advances	in	the	technology	of	the	airframe	,	the	engines	,	the	electronics	and	the	launch	operation	.
there	's	a	long	list	of	innovations	that	we	've	come	up	with	there	that	are	a	little	difficult	to	communicate	in	this	talk	,	but	--	ca	:	not	least	because	you	could	still	get	copied	,	right	?
you	have	n't	patented	this	stuff	.	it	's	really	interesting	to	me	.
em	:	no	,	we	do	n't	patent	.	ca	:	you	did	n't	patent	because	you	think	it	's	more	dangerous	to	patent	than	not	to	patent	.
em	:	since	our	primary	competitors	are	national	governments	,	the	enforceability	of	patents	is	questionable	.
ca	:	that	's	really	,	really	interesting	.
but	the	big	innovation	is	still	ahead	,	and	you	're	working	on	it	now	.	tell	us	about	this	.
em	:	right	,	so	the	big	innovation	--	ca	:	in	fact	,	let	's	roll	that	video	and	you	can	talk	us	through	it	,	what	's	happening	here	.
em	:	absolutely	.	so	the	thing	about	rockets	is	that	they	're	all	expendable	.
all	rockets	that	fly	today	are	fully	expendable	.
the	space	shuttle	was	an	attempt	at	a	reusable	rocket	,	but	even	the	main	tank	of	the	space	shuttle	was	thrown	away	every	time	,	and	the	parts	that	were	reusable	took	a	10,000	-	person	group	nine	months	to	refurbish	for	flight	.
so	the	space	shuttle	ended	up	costing	a	billion	dollars	per	flight	.
obviously	that	does	n't	work	very	well	for	--	ca	:	what	just	happened	there	?	we	just	saw	something	land	?
em	:	that	's	right	.	so	it	's	important	that	the	rocket	stages	be	able	to	come	back	,	to	be	able	to	return	to	the	launch	site	and	be	ready	to	launch	again	within	a	matter	of	hours	.
ca	:	wow	.	reusable	rockets	.	em	:	yes	.
and	so	what	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	realize	is	,	the	cost	of	the	fuel	,	of	the	propellant	,	is	very	small	.
it	's	much	like	on	a	jet	.
so	the	cost	of	the	propellant	is	about	.3	percent	of	the	cost	of	the	rocket	.
so	it	's	possible	to	achieve	,	let	's	say	,	roughly	100	-	fold	improvement	in	the	cost	of	spaceflight	if	you	can	effectively	reuse	the	rocket	.
that	's	why	it	's	so	important	.
every	mode	of	transport	that	we	use	,	whether	it	's	planes	,	trains	,	automobiles	,	bikes	,	horses	,	is	reusable	,	but	not	rockets	.
so	we	must	solve	this	problem	in	order	to	become	a	space	-	faring	civilization	.
ca	:	you	asked	me	the	question	earlier	of	how	popular	traveling	on	cruises	would	be	if	you	had	to	burn	your	ships	afterward	.	em	:	certain	cruises	are	apparently	highly	problematic	.
ca	:	definitely	more	expensive	.
so	that	's	potentially	absolutely	disruptive	technology	,	and	,	i	guess	,	paves	the	way	for	your	dream	to	actually	take	,	at	some	point	,	to	take	humanity	to	mars	at	scale	.
you	'd	like	to	see	a	colony	on	mars	.
em	:	yeah	,	exactly	.	spacex	,	or	some	combination	of	companies	and	governments	,	needs	to	make	progress	in	the	direction	of	making	life	multi	-	planetary	,	of	establishing	a	base	on	another	planet	,	on	mars	--	being	the	only	realistic	option	--	and	then	building	that	base	up	until	we	're	a	true	multi	-	planet	species	.
ca	:	so	progress	on	this	``	let	's	make	it	reusable	,	``	how	is	that	going	?	that	was	just	a	simulation	video	we	saw	.
how	's	it	going	?
em	:	we	're	actually	,	we	've	been	making	some	good	progress	recently	with	something	we	call	the	grasshopper	test	project	,	where	we	're	testing	the	vertical	landing	portion	of	the	flight	,	the	sort	of	terminal	portion	which	is	quite	tricky	.
and	we	've	had	some	good	tests	.
ca	:	can	we	see	that	?	em	:	yeah	.
so	that	's	just	to	give	a	sense	of	scale	.
we	dressed	a	cowboy	as	johnny	cash	and	bolted	the	mannequin	to	the	rocket	.
ca	:	all	right	,	let	's	see	that	video	then	,	because	this	is	actually	amazing	when	you	think	about	it	.
you	've	never	seen	this	before	.	a	rocket	blasting	off	and	then	--	em	:	yeah	,	so	that	rocket	is	about	the	size	of	a	12	-	story	building	.
so	now	it	's	hovering	at	about	40	meters	,	and	it	's	constantly	adjusting	the	angle	,	the	pitch	and	yaw	of	the	main	engine	,	and	maintaining	roll	with	coal	gas	thrusters	.
ca	:	how	cool	is	that	?
elon	,	how	have	you	done	this	?
these	projects	are	so	--	paypal	,	solarcity	,	tesla	,	spacex	,	they	're	so	spectacularly	different	,	they	're	such	ambitious	projects	at	scale	.
how	on	earth	has	one	person	been	able	to	innovate	in	this	way	?
what	is	it	about	you	?
em	:	i	do	n't	know	,	actually	.
i	do	n't	have	a	good	answer	for	you	.
i	work	a	lot	.	i	mean	,	a	lot	.
ca	:	well	,	i	have	a	theory	.	em	:	okay	.	all	right	.
ca	:	my	theory	is	that	you	have	an	ability	to	think	at	a	system	level	of	design	that	pulls	together	design	,	technology	and	business	,	so	if	ted	was	tbd	,	design	,	technology	and	business	,	into	one	package	,	synthesize	it	in	a	way	that	very	few	people	can	and	--	and	this	is	the	critical	thing	--	feel	so	damn	confident	in	that	clicked	-	together	package	that	you	take	crazy	risks	.
you	bet	your	fortune	on	it	,	and	you	seem	to	have	done	that	multiple	times	.
i	mean	,	almost	no	one	can	do	that	.
is	that	--	could	we	have	some	of	that	secret	sauce	?
can	we	put	it	into	our	education	system	?	can	someone	learn	from	you	?
it	is	truly	amazing	what	you	've	done	.
em	:	well	,	thanks	.	thank	you	.
well	,	i	do	think	there	's	a	good	framework	for	thinking	.
it	is	physics	.	you	know	,	the	sort	of	first	principles	reasoning	.
generally	i	think	there	are	--	what	i	mean	by	that	is	,	boil	things	down	to	their	fundamental	truths	and	reason	up	from	there	,	as	opposed	to	reasoning	by	analogy	.
through	most	of	our	life	,	we	get	through	life	by	reasoning	by	analogy	,	which	essentially	means	copying	what	other	people	do	with	slight	variations	.
and	you	have	to	do	that	.
otherwise	,	mentally	,	you	would	n't	be	able	to	get	through	the	day	.
but	when	you	want	to	do	something	new	,	you	have	to	apply	the	physics	approach	.
physics	is	really	figuring	out	how	to	discover	new	things	that	are	counterintuitive	,	like	quantum	mechanics	.
it	's	really	counterintuitive	.
so	i	think	that	's	an	important	thing	to	do	,	and	then	also	to	really	pay	attention	to	negative	feedback	,	and	solicit	it	,	particularly	from	friends	.
this	may	sound	like	simple	advice	,	but	hardly	anyone	does	that	,	and	it	's	incredibly	helpful	.
ca	:	boys	and	girls	watching	,	study	physics	.
learn	from	this	man	.
elon	musk	,	i	wish	we	had	all	day	,	but	thank	you	so	much	for	coming	to	ted	.
em	:	thank	you	.	ca	:	that	was	awesome	.	that	was	really	,	really	cool	.
look	at	that	.
just	take	a	bow	.	that	was	fantastic	.
thank	you	so	much	.
