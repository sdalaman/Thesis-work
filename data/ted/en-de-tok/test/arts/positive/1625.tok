``	my	air	jordans	cost	a	hundred	with	tax	.
my	suede	starters	jacket	says	raiders	on	the	back	.
i	'm	stylin	'	,	smilin	'	,	lookin	'	real	mean	,	because	it	ai	n't	about	being	heard	,	just	being	seen	.
my	leather	adidas	baseball	cap	matches	my	fake	gucci	backpack	.
ai	n't	nobody	who	looks	as	good	as	me	,	but	this	costs	money	,	it	sure	ai	n't	free	,	and	i	gots	no	job	,	no	money	at	all	,	but	it	's	easy	to	steal	all	this	from	the	mall	.
parents	say	i	should	n't	,	but	i	knows	i	should	.
got	to	do	what	i	can	to	make	sure	i	look	good	,	and	the	reason	i	have	to	look	real	good	,	well	,	to	tell	you	the	truth	,	man	,	i	do	n't	know	why	.	guess	it	makes	me	feel	special	inside	.
when	i	'm	wearing	fresh	gear	i	do	n't	have	to	hide	,	and	i	really	must	get	some	new	gear	soon	or	my	ego	will	pop	like	a	10	-	cent	balloon	.
but	security	is	tight	at	all	the	shops	.	every	day	there	are	more	and	more	cops	.
my	crew	is	laughing	at	me	because	i	'm	wearing	old	gear	.
school	's	almost	over	.	summer	is	near	.
and	i	'm	sportin	'	torn	jordans	.
i	need	something	new	.	only	one	thing	left	to	do	.
cut	school	friday	,	catch	the	subway	downtown	,	check	out	my	victims	hangin	'	around	.
maybe	i	'll	get	lucky	and	find	easy	prey	.
got	to	get	some	new	gear	.	there	's	no	other	way	.
i	'm	ready	and	willing	.	i	'm	packing	my	gun	.
this	is	serious	business	.	this	ai	n't	no	fun	.
and	i	ca	n't	have	my	posse	laughin	'	at	me	.
i'mma	cop	something	dope	,	just	wait	,	you	'll	see	.
come	out	of	the	station	,	west	4th	near	the	park	,	brothers	shooting	hoops	and	someone	remarks	,	'	hey	homes	,	where	you	get	them	nik	's	?	'	i	says	to	myself	,	'	yeah	.	i	likes	'	em	,	i	likes	.	'	they	were	q	-	tip	white	,	bright	and	blinding	my	eyes	.
the	red	emblem	of	michael	looked	as	if	it	could	fly	.
not	one	spot	of	dirt	.	the	airs	were	brand	new	.
had	my	pistol	and	knew	just	what	to	do	.
waited	until	it	was	just	the	right	time	,	followed	him	very	closely	behind	.
he	made	a	left	turn	on	houston	,	i	pulled	out	my	gun	,	and	i	said	,	'	gim	me	them	jordans	!	'	and	the	punk	tried	to	run	.
took	off	fast	,	did	n't	get	far	.	i	fired	,	'	pow	!	'	fool	fell	between	two	parked	cars	.
he	was	coughing	,	crying	,	blood	spilled	on	the	street	.
and	i	snatched	them	air	jordans	off	of	his	feet	.
while	laying	there	dying	,	all	he	could	say	was	,	``	please	man	,	do	n't	take	my	air	jordans	away	.	``
you	'd	think	he	'd	be	worried	about	staying	alive	.
as	i	took	off	with	his	sneakers	,	there	was	tears	in	his	eyes	.
very	next	day	,	i	bopped	into	school	with	my	brand	new	air	jordans	,	man	,	i	was	cool	.
i	killed	to	get	'	em	,	but	hey	,	i	do	n't	care	,	because	now	i	needs	a	new	jacket	to	wear	.	``
thank	you	.
for	the	last	15	years	that	i	have	been	performing	,	all	i	ever	wanted	to	do	was	transcend	poetry	to	the	world	.
see	,	it	was	n't	enough	for	me	to	write	a	book	.
it	was	n't	enough	for	me	to	join	a	slam	competition	,	and	while	those	things	hold	weight	,	it	was	n't	the	driving	force	that	pushes	the	pen	to	the	pad	.
the	hunger	and	thirst	was	,	and	still	remains	:	how	do	i	get	people	who	hate	poetry	to	love	me	?
because	i	'm	an	extension	of	my	work	,	and	if	they	love	me	,	then	they	will	love	my	work	,	and	if	they	love	my	work	,	then	they	will	love	poetry	,	and	if	they	love	poetry	,	then	i	will	have	done	my	job	,	which	is	to	transcend	it	to	the	world	.
and	in	1996	,	i	found	the	answer	in	principles	in	a	master	spoken	-	word	artist	named	reg	e.	gaines	,	who	wrote	the	famous	poem	,	``	please	do	n't	take	my	air	jordans	.	``
and	i	followed	this	guy	everywhere	until	i	had	him	in	the	room	,	and	i	read	him	one	of	my	pieces	,	and	you	know	what	he	told	me	?
``	yo	'	wack	.
you	know	what	the	problem	is	with	you	,	homie	?
you	do	n't	read	other	people	's	poetry	,	and	you	do	n't	got	any	subordination	for	verbal	measures	to	tonal	consideration	.	``
now	he	kept	on	rambling	about	poetry	and	styles	and	nuyorican	friday	nights	.
now	i	could	have	quit	.	i	should	have	quit	.
i	mean	,	i	thought	poetry	was	just	self	-	expression	.
i	did	n't	know	you	actually	have	to	have	creative	control	.
so	instead	of	quitting	,	i	followed	him	everywhere	.
when	he	was	writing	a	broadway	show	,	i	would	be	outside	of	the	door	.
i	would	wake	him	up	at	,	like	,	6:30	in	the	morning	to	ask	him	who	's	the	best	poet	.
i	remember	eating	the	eyes	of	a	fish	right	out	of	the	sea	because	he	told	me	it	was	brain	food	.
then	one	day	i	told	him	,	``	reg	e.	,	what	is	subordination	for	verbal	measures	to	tonal	consideration	?	``
and	he	handed	me	a	black	-	and	-	white	printed	out	thesis	on	a	poet	named	etheridge	knight	and	the	oral	nature	of	poetry	,	and	from	that	point	,	reggie	stopped	becoming	the	best	to	me	,	because	what	etheridge	knight	taught	me	was	that	i	could	make	my	words	sound	like	music	,	even	my	small	ones	,	the	monosyllables	,	the	ifs	,	ands	,	buts	,	whats	,	the	gangsta	in	my	slang	could	fall	right	on	the	ear	,	and	from	then	on	,	i	started	chasing	etheridge	knight	.
i	wanted	to	know	which	poet	he	read	,	and	i	landed	on	a	poem	called	[	``	dark	prophecy	:	sing	of	shine	``	]	,	a	toast	signifying	that	got	me	on	the	biggest	stage	a	poet	could	ever	be	:	broadway	,	baby	.
and	from	that	point	,	i	learned	how	to	pull	the	mic	away	and	attack	the	poetry	with	my	body	.
but	that	was	n't	the	biggest	lesson	i	ever	learned	.
the	biggest	lesson	i	learned	was	many	years	later	when	i	went	to	beverly	hills	and	i	ran	into	a	talent	agent	who	looked	at	me	up	and	down	and	said	i	do	n't	look	like	i	have	any	experience	to	be	working	in	this	business	.
and	i	said	to	him	,	``	listen	,	punk	fool	,	you	're	a	failed	actor	who	became	an	agent	,	and	you	know	why	you	failed	as	an	actor	?
because	people	like	me	took	your	job	.
i	've	traveled	all	the	way	from	cleveland	and	essex	in	east	new	york	,	took	the	local	6	line	up	to	the	hookers	of	hunt	's	point	who	were	in	my	way	on	my	way	to	master	the	art	of	space	,	and	the	one	-	to	-	infinite	amount	of	man	,	woman	and	child	you	can	fit	in	there	only	so	i	can	push	them	to	the	back	of	the	wall	with	my	experience	.
people	have	bought	tickets	to	my	experience	and	used	them	as	refrigerator	magnets	to	let	them	know	that	the	revolution	is	near	,	so	stock	up	.
i	'm	so	experienced	that	when	you	went	to	a	privileged	school	to	learn	a	shakespearean	sonnet	,	i	was	getting	those	beats	kicked	and	shoved	into	me	.
i	can	master	shock	of	``	the	crying	game	``	with	the	awe	of	a	child	being	called	an	aids	victim	by	a	bully	who	did	n't	know	that	it	was	his	father	who	gave	it	to	my	mother	,	and	that	's	a	double	entendre	.
i	'm	so	experienced	that	when	you	went	to	the	fell	school	and	all	the	rich	little	fairy	boys	decided	to	sponsor	a	child	in	it	,	that	was	me	,	but	kicked	me	out	when	i	was	caught	teaching	the	fairy	boys	how	to	rob	the	pats	off	a	pair	of	lee	jeans	and	bring	them	to	vim	.	let	me	see	chekhov	pull	that	off	.
sanford	meisner	was	my	uncle	artie	yelling	silently	to	himself	,	``	something	's	always	wrong	when	nothing	's	always	right	.	``
method	acting	is	nothing	but	a	mixture	of	multiple	personalities	,	believing	your	own	lies	are	reality	,	like	in	high	school	cool	kenny	telling	me	he	wanted	to	be	a	cop	.
dude	,	you	go	to	riker	's	island	academy	.
i	could	make	david	mamet	psychoanalyze	my	attack	on	dialogue	,	stanislavski	be	as	if	he	were	bruce	lee	kicking	your	roster	of	talentless	students	up	and	down	crenshaw	.
so	what	,	your	actors	studied	guerrilla	theater	at	the	london	rep	?
let	me	tell	you	an	ancient	chinese	saturday	afternoon	kung	fu	secret	.
boards	do	n't	hit	back	.
you	think	black	entertainers	have	it	hard	finding	work	in	this	business	?	i	'm	a	suspicious	mulatto	,	which	means	i	'm	too	black	to	be	white	and	too	white	to	be	doing	it	right	.
forget	the	american	ghetto	.	i	've	cracked	stages	in	soweto	,	buried	abortion	babies	in	potter	's	field	and	still	managed	to	keep	a	smile	on	my	face	,	so	whatever	you	curse	at	me	to	your	caddyshack	go	-	for	-	this	,	go	-	for	-	that	assistant	when	i	walk	out	that	door	,	whatever	slander	you	send	my	way	,	your	mother	.
thank	you	.
