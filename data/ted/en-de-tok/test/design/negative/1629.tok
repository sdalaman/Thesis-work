hello	,	doha	.	hello	.	salaam	alaikum	.
i	love	coming	to	doha	.	it	's	such	an	international	place	.
this	is	like	--	it	feels	like	the	united	nations	just	here	.
you	land	at	the	airport	,	and	you	're	welcomed	by	an	indian	lady	who	takes	you	to	al	maha	services	,	where	you	meet	a	filipino	lady	who	hands	you	off	to	a	south	african	lady	who	then	takes	you	to	a	korean	who	takes	you	to	a	pakistani	guy	with	the	luggage	who	takes	you	to	the	car	with	a	sri	lankan	.
you	go	to	the	hotel	and	you	check	in	.	there	's	a	lebanese	.
yeah	?	and	then	a	swedish	guy	showed	me	my	room	.
i	said	,	``	where	are	the	qataris	?	``
they	said	,	``	no	,	no	,	it	's	too	hot	.	they	come	out	later	.	they	're	smart	.	``
``	they	know	.	``
and	of	course	it	's	growing	so	fast	,	sometimes	there	's	growing	pains	.
you	know	,	like	sometimes	you	run	into	people	that	you	think	know	the	city	well	,	but	they	do	n't	know	it	that	well	.
my	indian	cab	driver	showed	up	at	the	w	,	and	i	asked	him	to	take	me	to	the	sheraton	,	and	he	said	,	``	no	problem	,	sir	.	``
and	then	we	sat	there	for	two	minutes	.
i	said	,	``	what	's	wrong	?	``	he	said	,	``	one	problem	,	sir	.	``
i	said	,	``	what	?	``	he	goes	,	``	where	is	it	?	``
i	go	,	``	you	're	the	driver	,	you	should	know	.	``	he	goes	,	``	no	,	i	just	arrived	,	sir	.	``
i	go	,	``	you	just	arrived	at	the	w	?	``	``	no	,	i	just	arrived	in	doha	,	sir	.
i	was	on	my	way	home	from	the	airport	.	i	got	a	job	.
i	'm	working	already	.	``
he	goes	,	``	sir	,	why	do	n't	you	drive	?	``
i	go	,	``	i	do	n't	know	where	we	're	going	.	``
``	neither	do	i.	it	will	be	an	adventure	,	sir	.	``
it	is	an	adventure	.	the	middle	east	has	been	an	adventure	the	past	couple	years	.
the	middle	east	is	going	crazy	with	the	arab	spring	and	revolution	and	all	this	.	are	there	any	lebanese	here	tonight	?
any	lebanese	by	applause	?	lebanese	.
yeah	.	the	middle	east	is	going	crazy	.
you	know	the	middle	east	is	going	crazy	when	lebanon	is	the	most	peaceful	place	in	the	region	.
who	would	have	thought	?	oh	my	gosh	.
no	.	there	's	serious	issues	in	the	region	.
some	people	do	n't	want	to	talk	about	them	.	i	'm	here	to	talk	about	them	tonight	.
ladies	and	gentlemen	of	the	middle	east	,	here	's	a	serious	issue	.	when	we	see	each	other	,	when	we	say	hello	,	how	many	kisses	are	we	going	to	do	?
every	country	is	different	and	it	's	confusing	,	okay	?
in	lebanon	,	they	do	three	.	in	egypt	,	they	do	two	.
i	was	in	lebanon	,	i	got	used	to	three	.
i	went	to	egypt	.	i	went	to	say	hello	to	this	one	egyptian	guy	,	i	went	,	one	,	two	.	i	went	for	three	.	he	was	n't	into	it	.
i	told	him	,	i	said	,	``	no	,	no	,	no	,	i	was	just	in	lebanon	.	``
he	goes	,	``	i	do	n't	care	where	you	were	.	you	just	stay	where	you	are	,	please	.	just	stay	where	you	are	.	``
i	went	to	saudi	arabia	.	in	saudi	arabia	,	they	go	one	,	two	,	and	then	they	stay	on	the	same	side	--	three	,	four	,	five	,	six	,	seven	,	eight	,	nine	,	10	,	11	,	12	,	13	,	14	,	15	,	16	,	17	,	18	.
next	time	you	see	a	saudi	,	look	closely	.	they	're	just	a	little	bit	tilted	.
``	abdul	,	are	you	okay	?	``	``	yeah	,	i	was	saying	hello	for	half	an	hour	.
i	'm	going	to	be	all	right	.	``
qataris	,	you	guys	do	the	nose	to	nose	.
why	is	that	?	are	you	too	tired	to	go	all	the	way	around	?
``	habibi	,	it	's	so	hot	.	just	come	here	for	a	second	.	say	hello	.
hello	,	habibi	.	just	do	n't	move	.	just	stay	there	please	.
i	need	to	rest	.	``
every	country	--	iranians	,	sometimes	we	do	two	,	sometimes	we	do	three	.
a	friend	of	mine	explained	to	me	,	before	the	'79	revolution	,	it	was	two	.	after	the	revolution	,	three	.
so	with	iranians	,	you	can	tell	whose	side	the	person	is	on	based	on	the	number	of	kisses	they	give	you	.
yeah	,	if	you	go	one	,	two	,	three	--	``	i	ca	n't	believe	you	support	this	regime	with	your	three	kisses	.	``
but	no	,	guys	,	really	,	it	is	exciting	to	be	here	,	and	like	i	said	,	you	guys	are	doing	a	lot	culturally	,	you	know	,	and	it	's	amazing	,	and	it	helps	change	the	image	of	the	middle	east	in	the	west	.	like	a	lot	of	americans	do	n't	know	a	lot	about	us	,	about	the	middle	east	.
i	'm	iranian	and	american	.	i	'm	there	.	i	know	,	i	've	traveled	here	.
there	's	so	much	,	we	laugh	,	right	?
people	do	n't	know	we	laugh	.	when	i	did	the	axis	of	evil	comedy	tour	,	it	came	out	on	comedy	central	,	i	went	online	to	see	what	people	were	saying	about	it	.	i	ended	up	on	a	conservative	website	.
one	guy	wrote	another	guy	.	he	said	,	``	i	never	knew	these	people	laughed	.	``
think	about	it	.	you	never	see	us	laughing	in	american	film	or	television	,	right	?
maybe	like	an	evil	--	like	,	``	wuhahaha	,	wuhahaha	.
i	will	kill	you	in	the	name	of	allah	,	wuhahahahaha	.	``
but	never	like	,	``	ha	ha	ha	ha	ha	ha	ha	ha	ha	.	``
we	like	to	laugh	.	we	like	to	celebrate	life	.
and	i	wish	more	americans	would	travel	here	.	i	always	encourage	my	friends	:	travel	,	see	the	middle	east	,	there	's	so	much	to	see	,	so	many	good	people	.
and	it	's	vice	versa	,	and	it	helps	stop	problems	of	misunderstanding	and	stereotypes	from	happening	.
for	example	,	i	do	n't	know	if	you	heard	about	this	,	a	little	while	ago	in	the	u.s.	there	was	a	muslim	family	walking	down	the	aisle	of	an	airplane	talking	about	the	safest	place	to	sit	on	the	plane	.
some	passengers	overheard	them	,	somehow	misconstrued	that	as	terrorist	talk	,	got	them	kicked	off	the	plane	.
it	was	a	family	,	a	mother	,	father	,	child	,	walking	down	the	aisle	,	talking	about	the	seating	.	now	as	a	middle	eastern	male	,	i	know	there	's	certain	things	i	'm	not	supposed	to	say	on	an	airplane	in	the	u.s.	,	right	?
i	'm	not	supposed	to	be	,	like	,	walking	down	the	aisle	,	and	be	like	,	``	hi	,	jack	.	``	you	know	,	that	's	not	cool	.
even	if	i	'm	there	with	my	friend	named	jack	,	i	say	,	``	greetings	,	jack	.	salutations	,	jack	.	``
never	``	hi	,	jack	.	``
but	now	apparently	we	ca	n't	even	talk	about	the	safest	place	to	sit	on	an	airplane	.
so	my	advice	to	all	my	middle	eastern	friends	and	muslim	friends	and	anyone	who	looks	middle	eastern	or	muslim	,	so	to	,	you	know	,	indians	,	and	latinos	,	everyone	,	if	you	're	brown	--	here	's	my	advice	to	my	brown	friends	.
the	next	time	you	're	on	an	airplane	in	the	u.s.	,	just	speak	your	mother	tongue	.
that	way	no	one	knows	what	you	're	saying	.	life	goes	on	.
granted	,	some	mother	tongues	might	sound	a	little	threatening	to	the	average	american	,	right	?
if	you	're	walking	down	the	aisle	speaking	arabic	,	you	might	freak	them	out	,	if	you	're	walking	,	``	[	arabic	]	,	``	they	might	say	,	``	what	's	he	talking	about	?	``
so	the	key	,	to	my	arab	brothers	and	sisters	,	you	got	ta	throw	in	random	good	words	to	put	people	at	ease	as	you	're	walking	down	the	aisle	.
just	as	you	're	walking	down	:	``	[	imitating	arabic	]	--	strawberry	!	``
``	[	imitating	arabic	]	--	rainbow	!	``
``	[	imitating	arabic	]	--	tutti	frutti	!	``
``	i	think	he	's	going	to	hijack	the	plane	with	some	ice	cream	.	``
thank	you	very	much	.	have	a	good	night	.
thank	you	,	ted	.
