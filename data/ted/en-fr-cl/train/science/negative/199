well , good morning ladies and gentlemen .
my name is art benjamin , and i am a " mathemagician . "
what that means is , i combine my loves of math and magic to do something i call " mathemagics . "
but before i get started , i have a quick question for the audience .
by any chance , did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator ?
seriously , if you have a calculator with you , raise your hand , raise your hand .
i -- was -- your hand go up ?
now bring it out , bring it out . anybody else ?
i see , i see one way in the back .
you sir , that 's three ,
and anybody on this side here ?
ok , you over there on the aisle . would the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculators , then join me up on stage .
and let 's give these volunteers a nice round of applause .
that 's right . now , since i have n't had the chance to work with these calculators , i need to make sure that they are all working properly .
would somebody get us started by giving us a two - digit number please ?
how about a two - digit number ?
audience : 22 .
arthur benjamin : 22. and another two - digit number , sir ?
audience : 47 .
ab : multiply 22 times 47 , make sure you get 1,034 , or the calculators are not working . do all of you get 1,034 ? 1,034 ?
woman : no.
ab : 594. let 's give three of them a nice round of applause there .
would you like to try a more standard calculator , just in case ?
ok , great .
what i 'm going to try and do then -- i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer .
that 's ok . i 'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator .
there is something called the square of a number , which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself .
for instance , five squared would be ?
audience : 25 .
ab : 25. now , the way we can square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number , such as five , hitting " times " and then " equals , " and on most calculators that will give you the square .
on some of these ancient rpn calculators , you 've got an " x squared " button on it , will allow you to do the calculation even faster .
what i 'm going to try and do now is to square , in my head , four two - digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators , even using the shortcut method .
what i 'll use is the second row this time , and i 'll get four of you -- one , two , three , four -- to each yell out a two - digit number , and if you would square the first number , and if you would square the second , the third and the fourth , i will try and race you to the answer . ok ?
so quickly , a two - digit number please .
audience : 37 .
ab : 37 squared , ok .
audience : 23 .
ab : 23 squared , ok .
audience : 59 .
ab : 59 squared , ok , and finally ?
audience : 93 .
ab : 93 squared . would you call out your answers , please ?
woman : 1369 . ab : 1369 .
woman : 529 .
ab : 529 .
man : 3481 .
ab : 3481 .
man : 8649 .
ab : thank you very much .
let me try to take this one step further .
i 'm going to try to square some three - digit numbers this time .
i wo n't even write these down -- i 'll just call them out as they 're called out to me .
anyone i point to , call out a three - digit number .
anyone on our panel , verify the answer .
just give some indication if it 's right .
a three - digit number , sir , yes ?
audience : 987 .
ab : 987 squared is 974,169 .
yes ? good .
another , another three - digit -- -- another three - digit number , sir ?
audience : 457 .
ab : 457 squared is 205,849 .
205,849 ?
yes ?
ok , another , another three - digit number , sir ?
audience : 321 .
ab : 321 is 103,041 . 103,041 .
yes ? one more three - digit number please .
audience : oh , 722 .
ab : 722 is 500 -- ooh , that 's a harder one .
is that 513,284 ?
woman : yes .
ab : yes ? oh , one more , one more three - digit number please .
audience : 162 .
162 squared is 26,244 .
thank you very much .
let me try to take this one step further .
i 'm going to try to square a four - digit number this time .
now you can all take your time on this ; i will not beat you to the answer on this one , but i will try to get the answer right .
to make this a little bit more random , let 's take the fourth row this time , let 's say , one , two , three , four .
if each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine , that will be the four - digit number that i 'll square .
audience : nine .
ab : nine .
audience : seven . ab : seven .
audience : five . ab : five .
audience : eight . ab : eight .
9,758 , this will take me a little bit of time , so bear with me .
95,218,564 ?
woman : yes .
ab : thank you very much .
now , i would attempt to square a five - digit number -- and i can -- but unfortunately most calculators cannot .
eight - digit capacity -- do n't you hate that ?
so , since we 've reached the limits of our calculators -- what 's that ? does yours go -- woman : i do n't know .
ab : does yours go higher ?
oh -- yours does ?
man : i can probably do it .
ab : i 'll talk to you later .
in the meanwhile , let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier .
let 's take the largest number on the board here , 8649 .
would you each enter that on your calculator ?
and instead of squaring it this time , i want you to take that number and multiply it by any three - digit number that you want , but do n't tell me what you 're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random three - digit number .
so you should have as an answer either a six - digit or probably a seven - digit number .
how many digits do you have , six or seven ?
seven , and yours ? woman : seven .
ab : seven ? seven ?
and , uncertain .
man : yeah .
ab : seven . is there any possible way that i could know what seven digit numbers you have ? say " no. "
good . then i shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable .
what i 'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits , any six of them , in any order you 'd like .
one digit at a time , i shall try and determine the digit you 've left out .
so , starting with your seven - digit number , call out any six of them please .
woman : one , ok , 197042 .
ab : did you leave out the number 6 ?
woman : yes , ab : good , ok , that 's one .
you have a seven - digit number , call out any six of them please .
woman : 44875 .
ab : i think i only heard five numbers . i -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6 ?
woman : yes . ab : same as she did , ok . you 've got a seven - digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear .
man : 079044 . ab : i think you left out the number 3 ?
that 's three . the odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000 : 10 to the fourth power .
ok , any six of them .
really scramble them up this time , please .
man : 263972 .
ab : did you leave out the number 7 ?
and let 's give all four of these people a nice round of applause .
thank you very much .
for my next number -- while i mentally recharge my batteries , i have one more question for the audience .
by any chance , does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on ?
if you think you know your birth day , raise your hand .
let 's see , starting with -- let 's start with a gentleman first ,
ok sir , what year was it , first of all ? that 's why i start with a gentleman first .
what year ?
audience : 1953 .
ab : 1953 , and the month ?
audience : november . ab : november what ?
audience : 23rd .
ab : 23rd -- was that a monday ? audience : yes .
yes , good . somebody else ? who else would like -- see i do n't -- have n't seen any women 's hands up .
ok , it 's -- how about you , what year ?
audience : 1949 . ab : 1949 , and the month ?
audience : october . ab : october what ?
audience : fifth .
ab : fifth -- was that a wednesday ?
yes , my -- i 'll go way to the back right now , how about you ?
yell it out , what year ? audience : 1959 .
ab : 1959 , ok -- and the month ?
audience : february .
ab : february what ? audience : sixth .
ab : sixth -- was that a friday ? audience : yes .
good , how about the person behind her ?
call -- call -- what year was it ?
audience : 1947 . ab : 1947 , and the month ?
audience : may . ab : may what ?
audience : seventh . ab : seventh -- would that be a wednesday ?
audience : yes .
ab : thank you very much .
anybody here who 'd like to know the day of the week they were born ?
we can do it that way .
of course , i could just make up an answer and you would n't know , so i come prepared for that .
i brought with me a book of calendars .
it goes as far back into the past as 1800 , ' cause you never know .
i did n't mean to look at you , sir -- you were just sitting there .
anyway , chris , you can help me out here , if you would n't mind .
this is a book of calendars , and i 'll ask -- who was it that wanted to know their birth day ? you sir ? ok .
what year was it , first of all ?
audience : 1966 .
ab : '66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966 -- and what month ?
audience : april . ab : april what ?
audience : 17th . ab : 17th -- i believe that was a sunday .
can you confirm , chris ?
chris anderson : yes . ab : yeah , ok . i 'll tell you what , chris : as long as you have that book in front of you , do me a favor , turn to a year outside of the 1900s ,
either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that 'll be a much greater challenge for me .
what year , chris , would you like ?
ca : 1824 .
ab : 1824 , ok .
and what month ? ca : june .
ab : june what ? ca : sixth .
ab : sixth -- was that a sunday ?
ca : it was . ab : and it was cloudy .
good , thank you very much .
but i 'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation .
there was a gentleman up here who had a 10 - digit calculator .
where is he , would you stand up , 10 - digit guy ?
ok , well stand up for me just for a second , so i can see where you are .
ok , oh , ok -- you have a 10 - digit calculator , sir , as well ?
ok , what i 'm going to try and do , is to square in my head a five - digit number requiring a 10 - digit calculator .
but to make my job more interesting for you , as well as for me , i 'm going to do this problem thinking out loud .
so you can actually , honestly hear what 's going on in my mind while i do a calculation of this size .
now , i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green .
i know as a magician we 're not supposed to reveal our secrets , but i 'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week , so -- i think we 're ok .
so , let 's see , let 's take a -- let 's take a different row of people , starting with you .
i 'll get five digits : one , two , three , four -- oh , i did this row already . let 's do the row before you , starting with you sir : one , two , three , four , five .
call out a single digit -- that will be the five - digit number that i will try to square . go ahead .
audience : five . ab : five .
audience : seven . ab : seven .
audience : six . ab : six .
audience : eight . ab : eight .
audience : three . ab : three .
57,683 squared . yuck .
let me explain to you how i 'm going to attempt this problem .
i 'm going to break the problem down into three parts .
i 'll do 57,000 squared , plus 683 squared , plus 57,000 times 683 times two .
add all those numbers together , and with any luck , arrive at the answer .
now , let me recap .
thank you .
while i explain something else -- -- i know , that you can use , right ?
while i do these calculation [ s ] , you might hear certain words , as opposed to numbers , creep into the calculation .
let me explain what that is .
this is a phonetic code , a mnemonic device that i use , that allows me to convert numbers into words .
i store them as words , and later on retrieve them as numbers .
i know it sounds complicated ; it 's not -- i just do n't want you to think you 're seeing something out of " rain man " here .
there 's definitely a method to my madness -- definitely , definitely . sorry .
if you want to talk to me about adhd afterwards , you can talk to me then . all right -- by the way , one last instruction , for my judges with the calculators -- ok , you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that i will make a mistake here .
if i do , do n't tell me what the mistake is ;
just say , " you 're close , " or something like that , and i 'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself .
if , however , i am right , whatever you do , do n't keep it to yourself , ok ?
make sure everybody knows that i got the answer right , because this is my big finish , ok .
so , without any more stalling , here we go .
i 'll start the problem in the middle , with 57 times 683 .
now , 57 times 68 is 3,400 , plus 476 is 3876 , that 's 38,760 plus 171 , 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931 .
38,931 ; double that to get 77,862 .
77,862 becomes cookie fission , cookie fission is 77,822 .
that seems right , i 'll go on . cookie fission , ok .
next , i do 57 squared , which is 3,249 , so i can say , three billion . take the 249 , add that to cookie , 249 , oops , but i see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie , 250 plus 77 , is 327 million -- fission , fission , ok , finally , we do 683 squared , that 's 700 times 666 , plus 17 squared is 466,489 , rev up if i need it , rev up , take the 466 , add that to fission , to get , oh gee -- 328,489 .
audience : yeah !
ab : good .
thank you very much .
i hope you enjoyed mathemagics . thank you .
