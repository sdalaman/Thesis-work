i 'm working a lot with motion and animation , and also i 'm an old dj and a musician .
so , music videos are something that i always found interesting , but they always seem to be so reactive .
so i was thinking , can you remove us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it ?
so with two designers , tolga and christina , at my office , we took a track -- many of you probably know it . it 's about 25 years old , and it 's david byrne and brian eno -- and we did this little animation .
and i think that it 's maybe interesting , also , that it deals with two problematic issues , which are rising waters and religion .
song : before god destroyed the people on the earth , he warned noah to build an ark. and after noah built his ark , i believe he told noah to warn the people that they must change all their wicked ways before he come upon them and destroy them .
and when noah had done built his ark , i understand that somebody began to rend a song .
and the song began to move on i understand like this . and when noah had done built his ark ...
move on ... in fact ... concern ...
so they get tired , has come dark and rain ; they get weary and tired .
and then he went and knocked an old lady house .
and old lady ran to the door and say , " who is it ? "
jack say , " me , mama - san , could we spend the night here ?
because we 're far from home , we 're very tired . "
and the old lady said , " oh yes , come on in . "
it was come dark and rain , will make you weary and tired .
