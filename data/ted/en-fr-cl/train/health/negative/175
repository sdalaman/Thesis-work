i have a tough job to do .
you know , when i looked at the profile of the audience here , with their connotations and design , in all its forms , and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks , and so on , that i wanted to tell you , i wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context .
in order to do that in 20 minutes , i have to bring out four ideas -- it 's like four pieces of a puzzle .
and if i succeed in doing that , maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on , and perhaps help me do my work .
the first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education .
now , by remoteness , i mean two or three different kinds of things .
of course , remoteness in its normal sense , which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center , you get to remoter areas .
what happens to education ?
the second , or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world , you have pockets , like slums , or shantytowns , or poorer areas , which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city , so it 's us and them .
what happens to education in that context ?
so keep both of those ideas of remoteness .
we made a guess . the guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers .
if they do have , they cannot retain those teachers . they do not have good enough infrastructure .
and if they had some infrastructure , they have difficulty maintaining it .
but i wanted to check if this is true . so what i did last year was we hired a car , looked up on google , found a route into northern india from new delhi which , you know , which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers . drove out about 300 kilometers , and wherever we found a school , administered a set of standard tests , and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph .
the graph was interesting , although you need to consider it carefully .
i mean , this is a very small sample ; you should not generalize from it .
but it was quite obvious , quite clear , that for this particular route that i had taken , the remoter the school was , the worse its results seemed to be .
that seemed a little damning , and i tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure , or with the availability of electricity , and things like that .
to my surprise , it did not correlate .
it did not correlate with the size of classrooms .
it did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure .
it did not correlate with the poverty levels . it did not correlate .
but what happened was that when i administered a questionnaire to each of these schools , with one single question for the teachers -- which was , " would you like to move to an urban , metropolitan area ? " --
69 percent of them said yes . and as you can see from that , they say yes just a little bit out of delhi , and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of delhi -- because , you know , those are relatively better off areas --
and then from 200 kilometers out of delhi , the answer is consistently yes .
i would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that , i wish i was in some other school , probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results .
so it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools , as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat , and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing . it appears that way .
when you take education and technology , then i find in the literature that , you know , things like websites , collaborative environments -- you 've been listening to all that in the morning -- it 's always piloted first in the best schools , the best urban schools , and , according to me , biases the result .
the literature -- one part of it , the scientific literature -- consistently blames et as being over - hyped and under - performing .
the teachers always say , well , it 's fine , but it 's too expensive for what it does .
because it 's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting , let 's say , 80 percent of whatever they could do .
you put in this new super - duper technology , and now they get 83 percent .
so the principal looks at it and says , 3 percent for 300,000 dollars ? forget it .
if you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools , where the score was 30 percent , and , let 's say , took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing .
so the relative change that et , educational technology , would make , would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top , but we seem to be doing it the other way about .
so i came to this conclusion that et should reach the underprivileged first , not the other way about .
and finally came the question of , how do you tackle teacher perception ?
whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology , the teacher 's first reaction is , you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it 's impossible .
i do n't know why it 's impossible , but , even for a moment , if you did assume that it 's impossible -- i have a quotation from sir arthur c. clarke , the science fiction writer whom i met in colombo , and he said something which completely solves this problem .
he said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine , should be .
so , you know , it puts the teacher into a tough bind , you have to think .
anyway , so i 'm proposing that an alternative primary education , whatever alternative you want , is required where schools do n't exist , where schools are not good enough , where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough , for whatever reason .
if you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies , then you do n't need an alternative education .
so far i have n't come across such an area , except for one case . i wo n't name the area , but somewhere in the world people said , we do n't have this problem , because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools .
there are such areas , but -- anyway , i 'd never heard that anywhere else .
i 'm going to talk about children and self - organization , and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like .
they 're called the hole - in - the - wall experiments .
i 'll have to really rush through this . they 're a set of experiments .
the first one was done in new delhi in 1999 .
and what we did over there was pretty much simple .
i had an office in those days which bordered a slum , an urban slum , so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum .
they cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole - in - the - wall -- and put a pretty powerful pc into that hole , sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end , a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall , put it on high - speed internet , put the internet explorer there , put it on altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there .
and this is what we saw .
so that was my office in iit . here 's the hole - in - the - wall .
about eight hours later , we found this kid .
to the right is this eight - year - old child who -- and to his left is a six - year - old girl , who is not very tall .
and what he was doing was , he was teaching her to browse .
so it sort of raised more questions than it answered .
is this real ? does the language matter , because he 's not supposed to know english ?
will the computer last , or will they break it and steal it -- and did anyone teach them ?
the last question is what everybody said , but you know , i mean , they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office , can you show me how to do it , and then somebody taught him .
so i took the experiment out of delhi and repeated it , this time in a city called shivpuri in the center of india , where i was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything .
so it was a warm day , and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building . this is the first kid who came there ; he later on turned out to be a 13 - year - old school dropout .
he came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad .
very quickly , he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen -- and later on he told me , " i have never seen a television where you can do something . "
so he figured that out . it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television .
and then , as he was doing that , he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad -- you 'll see him do that .
he did that , and the internet explorer changed page .
eight minutes later , he looked from his hand to the screen , and he was browsing : he was going back and forth .
when that happened , he started calling all the neighborhood children , like , children would come and see what 's happening over here .
and by the evening of that day , 70 children were all browsing .
so eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there .
so we thought that this is what was happening : that children in groups can self - instruct themselves to use a computer and the internet . but under what circumstances ?
at this time there was a -- the main question was about english .
people said , you know , you really ought to have this in indian languages . so i said , have what , shall i translate the internet into some indian language ? that 's not possible .
so , it has to be the other way about .
but let 's see , how do the children tackle the english language ?
i took the experiment out to northeastern india , to a village called madantusi , where , for some reason , there was no english teacher , so the children had not learned english at all .
and i built a similar hole - in - the - wall .
one big difference in the villages , as opposed to the urban slums : there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk .
in the urban slums , the girls tend to stay away .
i left the computer there with lots of cds -- i did n't have any internet -- and came back three months later .
so when i came back there , i found these two kids , eight - and 12 - year - olds , who were playing a game on the computer .
and as soon as they saw me they said , " we need a faster processor and a better mouse . "
i was real surprised .
you know , how on earth did they know all this ?
and they said , " well , we 've picked it up from the cds . "
so i said , " but how did you understand what 's going on over there ? "
so they said , " well , you 've left this machine which talks only in english , so we had to learn english . "
so then i measured , and they were using 200 english words with each other -- mispronounced , but correct usage -- words like exit , stop , find , save , that kind of thing , not only to do with the computer but in their day - to - day conversations .
so , madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier ; in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to .
finally , i got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable , if they happen everywhere else .
india is a good place to do such an experiment in , because we have all the ethnic diversities , all the -- you know , the genetic diversity , all the racial diversities , and also all the socio - economic diversities .
so , i could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world .
so i did this for almost five years , and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of india .
this is the himalayas . up in the north , very cold .
i also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors , and i was using regular , normal pcs , so i needed different climates , for which india is also great , because we have very cold , very hot , and so on .
this is the desert to the west . near the pakistan border .
and you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages -- the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the english alphabet .
then to central india -- very warm , moist , fishing villages , where humidity is a very big killer of electronics .
so we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power , so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running .
i want to just cut this short . we did this over and over again .
this sequence is also nice . this is a small child , a six - year - old , telling his eldest sister what to do .
and this happens very often with these computers , that the younger children are found teaching the older ones .
what did we find ? we found that six - to 13 - year - olds can self - instruct in a connected environment , irrespective of anything that we could measure .
so if they have access to the computer , they will teach themselves , including intelligence .
i could n't find a single correlation with anything , but it had to be in groups .
and that may be of great , you know , interest to this group , because all of you are talking about groups .
so here was the power of what a group of children can do , if you lift the adult intervention .
just a quick idea of the measurements .
we took standard statistical techniques , so i 'm going to not talk about that .
but we got a clean learning curve , almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school .
i 'll leave it at that , because , i mean , it sort of says it all , does n't it ?
what could they learn to do ?
basic windows functions , browsing , painting , chatting and email , games and educational material , music downloads , playing video .
in short , what all of us do .
and over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer .
so , how do they do that ?
if you calculated the actual time of access , it would work out to minutes per day , so that 's not how it 's happening .
what you have , actually , is there is one child operating the computer .
and surrounding him are usually three other children , who are advising him on what they should do .
if you test them , all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them .
around these four are usually a group of about 16 children , who are also advising , usually wrongly , about everything that 's going on on the computer .
and all of them also will clear a test given on that subject .
so they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing .
it seems counter - intuitive to adult learning , but remember , eight - year - olds live in a society where most of the time they are told , do n't do this , you know , do n't touch the whiskey bottle .
so what does the eight - year - old do ?
he observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched .
and if you tested him , he would answer every question correctly on that topic .
so , they seem to be able to acquire very quickly .
so what was the conclusion over the six years of work ?
it was that primary education can happen on its own , or parts of it can happen on its own .
it does not have to be imposed from the top downwards .
it could perhaps be a self - organizing system , so that was the second bit that i wanted to tell you , that children can self - organize and attain an educational objective .
the third piece was on values , and again , to put it very briefly , i conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over india ,
and asked them -- i gave them about 68 different values - oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions .
we got all sorts of opinions . yes , no or i do n't know .
i simply took those questions where i got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes -- so i was able to get a collection of 16 such statements .
these were areas where the children were clearly confused , because half said yes and half said no.
a typical example being , " sometimes it is necessary to tell lies . "
they do n't have a way to determine which way to answer this question ; perhaps none of us do .
so i leave you with this third question .
can technology alter the acquisition of values ?
finally , self - organizing systems , about which , again , i wo n't say too much because you 've been hearing all about it .
natural systems are all self - organizing : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies -- except for the debate about an intelligent designer .
but at this point in time , as far as science goes , it 's self - organization .
but other examples are traffic jams , stock market , society and disaster recovery , terrorism and insurgency .
and you know about the internet - based self - organizing systems .
so here are my four sentences then .
remoteness affects the quality of education .
educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first , and other areas later .
values are acquired ; doctrine and dogma are imposed -- the two opposing mechanisms .
and learning is most likely a self - organizing system .
if you put all the four together , then it gives -- according to me -- it gives us a goal , a vision , for educational technology .
an educational technology and pedagogy that is digital , automatic , fault - tolerant , minimally invasive , connected and self - organized .
as educationists , we have never asked for technology ; we keep borrowing it .
powerpoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology , but it was not meant for education , it was meant for making boardroom presentations .
we borrowed it . video conferencing . the personal computer itself .
i think it 's time that the educationists made their own specs , and i have such a set of specs . this is a brief look at that .
and such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness , values and violence .
so i thought i 'd give it a name -- why do n't we call it " outdoctrination . "
and could this be a goal for educational technology in the future ? so i want to leave that as a thought with you .
thank you .
