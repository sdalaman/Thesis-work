it is a thrill to be here at a conference that 's devoted to " inspired by nature " -- you can imagine .
and i 'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section .
did you notice this section is foreplay ?
because i get to talk about one of my favorite critters , which is the western grebe . you have n't lived until you 've seen these guys do their courtship dance .
i was on bowman lake in glacier national park , which is a long , skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it , and my partner and i have a rowing shell .
and so we were rowing , and one of these western grebes came along .
and what they do for their courtship dance is , they go together , the two of them , the two mates , and they begin to run underwater .
they paddle faster , and faster , and faster , until they 're going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water , and they 're standing upright , sort of paddling the top of the water .
and one of these grebes came along while we were rowing .
and so we 're in a skull , and we 're moving really , really quickly .
and this grebe , i think , sort of , mistaked us for a prospect , and started to run along the water next to us , in a courtship dance -- for miles .
it would stop , and then start , and then stop , and then start .
now that is foreplay .
i came this close to changing species at that moment .
obviously , life can teach us something in the entertainment section . life has a lot to teach us .
but what i 'd like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design .
what 's happened since the book came out -- the book was mainly about research in biomimicry --
and what 's happened since then is architects , designers , engineers -- people who make our world -- have started to call and say , we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us , in real time , become inspired .
or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out into the natural world . we 'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world , who might inspire us .
so this is a picture from a galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers ; they purify wastewater .
and some of them were very resistant , actually , to being there .
what they said to us at first was , you know , we already do biomimicry .
we use bacteria to clean our water . and we said , well , that 's not exactly being inspired by nature .
that 's bioprocessing , you know ; that 's bio - assisted technology : using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old , old technology called " domestication . "
this is learning something , learning an idea , from an organism and then applying it .
and so they still were n't getting it .
so we went for a walk on the beach and i said , well , give me one of your big problems . give me a design challenge , sustainability speed bump , that 's keeping you from being sustainable .
and they said scaling , which is the build - up of minerals inside of pipes .
and they said , you know what happens is , mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up .
and then the aperture closes , and we have to flush the pipes with toxins , or we have to dig them up .
so if we had some way to stop this scaling -- and so i picked up some shells on the beach . and i asked them , what is scaling ? what 's inside your pipes ?
and they said , calcium carbonate .
and i said , that 's what this is ; this is calcium carbonate .
and they did n't know that .
they did n't know that what a seashell is , it 's templated by proteins , and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell .
so the same sort of a process , without the proteins , is happening on the inside of their pipes . they did n't know .
this is not for lack of information ; it 's a lack of integration .
you know , it 's a silo , people in silos . they did n't know that the same thing was happening . so one of them thought about it and said , ok , well , if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self - assembly -- then why are n't shells infinite in size ? what stops the scaling ?
why do n't they just keep on going ?
and i said , well , in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization -- and then they all sort of leaned in -- they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization .
it literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal .
and , in fact , there is a product called tpa that 's mimicked that protein -- that stop - protein -- and it 's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes .
that changed everything . from then on , you could not get these engineers back in the boat .
the first day they would take a hike , and it was , click , click , click , click . five minutes later they were back in the boat .
we 're done . you know , i 've seen that island .
after this , they were crawling all over . they would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel .
what had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve .
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world -- that 's the switch .
that 's the profound switch .
what they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere ; they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world .
3.8 billion years of field - testing .
10 to 30 -- craig venter will probably tell you ; i think there 's a lot more than 30 million -- well - adapted solutions .
the important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context .
and the context is the earth -- the same context that we 're trying to solve our problems in .
so it 's the conscious emulation of life 's genius .
it 's not slavishly mimicking -- although al is trying to get the hairdo going -- it 's not a slavish mimicry ; it 's taking the design principles , the genius of the natural world , and learning something from it .
now , in a group with so many it people , i do have to mention what i 'm not going to talk about , and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things , on the software side . so there 's computers that protect themselves , like an immune system , and we 're learning from gene regulation and biological development . and we 're learning from neural nets , genetic algorithms , evolutionary computing .
that 's on the software side . but what 's interesting to me is that we have n't looked at this , as much . i mean , these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there 's dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in silicon valley .
so the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success .
so what can we learn about making -- not just computers , but everything ?
the plane you came in , cars , the seats that you 're sitting on .
how do we redesign the world that we make , the human - made world ?
more importantly , what should we ask in the next 10 years ?
and there 's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has .
what 's the syllabus ?
three questions , for me , are key .
how does life make things ?
this is the opposite ; this is how we make things .
it 's called heat , beat and treat -- that 's what material scientists call it .
and it 's carving things down from the top , with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product . you heat it up ; you beat it with high pressures ; you use chemicals . ok . heat , beat and treat .
life ca n't afford to do that . how does life make things ?
how does life make the most of things ?
that 's a geranium pollen .
and its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily . look at that shape .
life adds information to matter .
in other words : structure .
it gives it information . by adding information to matter , it gives it a function that 's different than without that structure .
and thirdly , how does life make things disappear into systems ?
because life does n't really deal in things ; there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems .
really quick syllabus .
as i 'm reading more and more now , and following the story , there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences .
and at the same time , i 'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are .
the two groups are not talking to each other .
at all .
what in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture , to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we 're in ?
i 'm going to try to go through 12 , really quickly .
one that 's exciting to me is self - assembly .
now , you 've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology .
back to that shell : the shell is a self - assembling material .
on the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater . it 's a layered structure that 's mineral and then polymer , and it makes it very , very tough .
it 's twice as tough as our high - tech ceramics .
but what 's really interesting : unlike our ceramics that are in kilns , it happens in seawater . it happens near , in and near , the organism 's body .
this is sandia national labs . a guy named jeff brinker has found a way to have a self - assembling coding process .
imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid , lifting it out of the liquid , and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together , so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works .
imagine making all of our hard materials that way .
imagine spraying the precursors to a pv cell , to a solar cell , onto a roof , and having it self - assemble into a layered structure that harvests light .
here 's an interesting one for the it world : bio - silicon . this is a diatom , which is made of silicates .
and so silicon , which we make right now -- it 's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips -- this is a bio - mineralization process that 's now being mimicked .
this is at uc santa barbara . look at these diatoms . this is from ernst haeckel 's work .
imagine being able to -- and , again , it 's a templated process , and it solidifies out of a liquid process -- imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature .
imagine being able to make perfect lenses .
on the left , this is a brittle star ; it 's covered with lenses that the people at lucent technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever .
it 's one of the most distortion - free lenses we know of .
and there 's many of them , all over its entire body .
what 's interesting , again , is that it self - assembles .
a woman named joanna aizenberg , at lucent , is now learning to do this in a low - temperature process to create these sort of lenses . she 's also looking at fiber optics .
that 's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic .
down at the very base of it , there 's fiber optics that work better than ours , actually , to move light ,
but you can tie them in a knot ; they 're incredibly flexible .
here 's another big idea : co 2 as a feedstock .
a guy named geoff coates , at cornell , said to himself , you know , plants do not see co 2 as the biggest poison of our time .
we see it that way . plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose , right , out of co 2. he 's found a way -- he 's found a catalyst -- and he 's found a way to take co 2 and make it into polycarbonates . biodegradable plastics out of co 2 -- how plant - like .
solar transformations : the most exciting one .
there are people who are mimicking the energy - harvesting device inside of purple bacterium , the people at asu . even more interesting , lately , in the last couple of weeks , people have seen that there 's an enzyme called hydrogenase that 's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons , and is able to take hydrogen up -- basically what 's happening in a fuel cell , in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell .
in our fuel cells , we do it with platinum ;
life does it with a very , very common iron .
and a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen - juggling hydrogenase .
that 's very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without platinum .
power of shape : here 's a whale . we 've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them . and those little bumps actually increase efficiency in , for instance , the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent .
which is an amazing fossil fuel savings , if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing .
color without pigments : this peacock is creating color with shape .
light comes through , it bounces back off the layers ; it 's called thin - film interference . imagine being able to self - assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color .
imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface , so that it 's self - cleaning with just water . that 's what a leaf does .
see that up - close picture ?
that 's a ball of water , and those are dirt particles .
and that 's an up - close picture of a lotus leaf .
there 's a company making a product called lotusan , which mimics -- when the building facade paint dries , it mimics the bumps in a self - cleaning leaf , and rainwater cleans the building .
water is going to be our big , grand challenge : quenching thirst .
here are two organisms that pull water .
the one on the left is the namibian beetle pulling water out of fog .
the one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air ,
does not drink fresh water .
pulling water out of monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in atlanta , before it gets into a building , are key technologies .
separation technologies are going to be extremely important .
what if we were to say , no more hard rock mining ?
what if we were to separate out metals from waste streams , small amounts of metals in water ? that 's what microbes do ; they chelate metals out of water .
there 's a company here in san francisco called mr 3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes ' molecules on filters to mine waste streams .
green chemistry is chemistry in water .
we do chemistry in organic solvents .
this is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider . is n't that beautiful ?
green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature 's recipe book .
it 's not easy , because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table .
and we use all of them , even the toxic ones .
to figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table , and create miracle materials like that cell , is the task of green chemistry .
timed degradation : packaging that is good until you do n't want it to be good anymore , and dissolves on cue .
that 's a mussel you can find in the waters out here ,
and the threads holding it to a rock are timed ; at exactly two years , they begin to dissolve .
healing : this is a good one .
that little guy over there is a tardigrade .
there is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients . and the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken ; what 's called the " cold chain " gets broken .
a guy named bruce rosner looked at the tardigrade -- which dries out completely , and yet stays alive for months and months and months , and is able to regenerate itself .
and he found a way to dry out vaccines -- encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells -- meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated .
they can be put in a glove compartment , ok .
learning from organisms . this is a session about water -- learning about organisms that can do without water , in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration .
i 'm not going to get to 12 .
but what i am going to do is tell you that the most important thing , besides all of these adaptations , is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that 's going to take care of their offspring .
when they 're involved in foreplay , they 're thinking about something very , very important -- and that 's having their genetic material remain , 10,000 generations from now .
and that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that 'll take care of their offspring .
that 's the biggest design challenge .
luckily , there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas .
good luck having a conversation with them .
thank you .
chris anderson : talk about foreplay , i -- we need to get to 12 , but really quickly .
janine benyus : oh really ?
ca : yeah . just like , you know , like the 10 - second version of 10 , 11 and 12. because we just -- your slides are so gorgeous , and the ideas are so big , i ca n't stand to let you go down without seeing 10 , 11 and 12 .
jb : ok , put this -- ok , i 'll just hold this thing . ok , great .
ok , so that 's the healing one .
sensing and responding : feedback is a huge thing .
this is a locust . there can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer , and yet they do n't collide with one another .
and yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year .
right . there 's a person at newcastle who has figured out that it 's a very large neuron .
and she 's actually figuring out how to make a collision - avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust .
this is a huge and important one , number 11 .
and that 's the growing fertility .
that means , you know , net fertility farming .
we should be growing fertility . and , oh yes -- we get food , too .
because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life .
and really , that 's what other organisms do as well .
in ensemble , that 's what whole ecosystems do : they create more and more opportunities for life .
our farming has done the opposite .
so , farming based on how a prairie builds soil , ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range ,
even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water , but creates incredibly sparkling productivity .
this is the simple design brief . i mean , it looks simple because the system , over 3.8 billion years , has worked this out .
that is , those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places , are not around to tell us about it .
that 's the twelfth one .
life -- and this is the secret trick ; this is the magic trick -- life creates conditions conducive to life .
it builds soil ; it cleans air ; it cleans water ; it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and i need to live .
and it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs . so it 's not mutually exclusive .
we have to find a way to meet our needs , while making of this place an eden .
ca : janine , thank you so much .
