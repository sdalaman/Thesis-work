i want to start off by saying , houston , we have a problem .
we 're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space . in fact , we 've regressed .
we stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done .
and that is , instinctively we 've gone out and climbed over difficult places , went to more hostile places ,
and found out later , maybe to our surprise , that that 's the reason we survived .
and i feel very strongly that it 's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it 's ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it .
they need to look forward to exploration ; they need to look forward to colonization ; they need to look forward to breakthroughs .
we need to inspire them , because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future .
i 'm particularly troubled that what nasa 's doing right now with this new bush doctrine to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot , i screwed up .
we have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics .
what we 're looking forward to is -- what we 're looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children ,
but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country -- the boeing 's and lockheed 's space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff .
we 're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later ? and we 're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new .
i 'm really troubled by that . but anyway that 's -- the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today , though , is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later .
that 's the theme of my next 15 minutes here .
and i think that the inspiration begins when you 're very young : three - year - olds , up to 12- , 14 - year - olds .
what they look at is the most important thing .
let 's take a snapshot at aviation .
and there was a wonderful little short four - year time period when marvelous things happened .
it started in 1908 , when the wright brothers flew in paris , and everybody said , " ooh , hey , i can do that . " there 's only a few people that have flown in early 1908 . in four years , 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes , thousand of pilots . airplanes were invented by natural selection .
now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today , but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes .
there were probably at least 30,000 different things tried , and when they crash and kill the pilot , do n't try that again .
the ones that flew and landed ok because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition .
so we , by making a whole bunch of attempts , thousands of attempts , in that four - year time period , we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today . and that 's why they 're so safe , as we gave it a lot of chance to find what 's good .
that has not happened at all in space flying .
there 's only been two concepts tried -- two by the u.s. and one by the russians .
well , who was inspired during that time period ?
aviation week asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation .
and i wrote them down and i found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation .
well , what happened when i was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too .
the jet age started : the missile age started . von braun was on there showing how to go to mars -- and this was before sputnik .
and this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now . we thought there 'd be animals there ; we knew there were plants there ; the colors change , right ?
but , you know , nasa screwed that up because they 've sent these robots and they 've landed it only in the deserts .
if you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew , and the red line is top - of - the - line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport .
you notice here 's a big jump when i was a little kid -- and i think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people were n't having the courage to try .
well , what did i do when i was a kid ?
i did n't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing
and , well , we did n't have drugs in those days . but i did competition model airplanes .
i spent about seven years during the vietnam war flight - testing airplanes for the air force . and then i went in and i had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages .
and some 3,000 of those are flying . of course , one of them is around the world voyager . i founded another company in '82 , which is my company now .
and we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982 .
and there 's a lot of them that i actually ca n't show you on this chart .
the most impressive airplane ever , i believe , was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet .
stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly , taken out of service .
we retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56 . what ?
the most impressive spaceship ever , i believe , was a grumman lunar lander . it was a -- you know , it landed on the moon , take off of the moon , did n't need any maintenance guys -- that 's kind of cool .
we 've lost that capability . we abandoned it in '72 .
this thing was designed three years after gagarin first flew in space in 1961 .
three years , and we ca n't do that now . crazy .
talk very briefly about innovation cycles , things that grow , have a lot of activity ; they die out when they 're replaced by something else .
these things tend to happen every 25 years . 40 years long , with an overlap . you can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies . the interesting thing --
by the way , the speed here , excuse me , higher - speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles . there is none here .
these two new airplanes are the same speed as the dc 8 that was done in 1958 .
here 's the biggie , and that is , you do n't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it .
you know , a good example , of course , is the darpa net .
computers were used for artillery first , then irs .
but when we got it , now you have all the level of activity , all the benefit from it . private sector has to do it .
keep that in mind . i put down innovation --
i 've looked for innovation cycles in space ; i found none .
the very first year , starting when gagarin went in space , and a few weeks later alan shepherd , there were five manned space flights in the world -- the very first year .
in 2003 , everyone that the united states sent to space was killed .
there were only three or four flights in 2003 .
in 2004 , there were only two flights : two russian soyuz flights to the international manned station . and i had to fly three in mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five , which was the number the same year back in 1961 .
there is no growth . there 's no activity . there 's no nothing .
this is a picture here taken from spaceshipone .
this is a picture here taken from orbit .
our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that .
we know how to do it for sub - orbital flying now , do it safe enough -- at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done .
and i think i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company .
well , first of all , what 's going to happen next ?
the first industry will be a high volume , a lot of players .
there 's another one announced just last week .
and it will be sub - orbital . and the reason it has to be sub - orbital is , there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit . the governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died .
that 's -- you do n't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record .
it 'll be very high volume ; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020 .
i ca n't tell you when this will start , because i do n't want my competition to know my schedule .
but i think once it does , we will find solutions ,
and very quickly , you 'll see those resort hotels in orbit .
and that real easy thing to do , which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view . and that will be really cool .
because the moon does n't have an atmosphere -- you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want .
oh , it 's going to be so much fun .
ok . my critics say , " hey , rutan 's just spending a lot of these billionaires ' money for joyrides for billionaires .
what 's this ? this is not a transportation system ; it 's just for fun . "
and i used to be bothered by that , and then i got to thinking ,
well , wait a minute . i bought my first apple computer in 1978
and i bought it because i could say , " i got a computer at my house and you do n't .
' what do you use it for ? ' come over . it does frogger . " ok .
not the bank 's computer or lockheed 's computer , but the home computer was for games .
for a whole decade it was for fun -- we did n't even know what it was for .
but what happened , the fact that we had this big industry , big development , big improvement and capability and so on , and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention .
and the inventor is in this audience .
al gore invented the internet and because of that , something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me -- a whole decade for fun , became everything -- our commerce , our research , our communication and , if we let the google guys think for another couple weekends , we can add a dozen more things to the list .
and it wo n't be very long before you wo n't be able to convince kids that we did n't always have computers in our homes .
so fun is defendable .
ok , i want to show you kind of a busy chart , but in it is my prediction with what 's going to happen .
and in it also brings up another point , right here .
there 's a group of people that have come forward -- and you do n't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children , this little three - to 15 - year - old age , by us going to orbit and going to the moon here , right in this time period .
paul allen , elan musk , richard branson , jeff bezos , the ansari family , which is now funding the russians ' sub - orbital thing , bob bigelow , a private space station , and carmack .
these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area , and i think it 's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they 're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability , and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore . and i think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct .
they were inspired by big progress . but look at the progress that 's going on after that .
there were a couple of examples here .
the military fighters had a -- highest - performance military airplane was the sr 71. it went a whole life cycle , got too rusty to fly ,
and was taken out of service . the concorde doubled the speed for airline travel .
it went a whole life cycle without competition , took out of service . and we 're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s .
but something is out there to inspire our kids now .
and i 'm talking about if you 've got a baby now , or if you 've got a 10 - year - old now .
what 's out there is there 's something really interesting going to happen here .
relatively soon , you 'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest - performance military operational airplane . it 's never happened before .
the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been , well , you know , you win the war in 12 minutes ; why do you need something better ?
but i think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub - orbital flights to space , very soon -- wait a minute , what 's happening here , we 'll have military fighters with sub - orbital capability , and i think very soon this .
but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first .
ok , i look forward to a new " capitalist 's space race , " let 's call it .
you remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige , because we lost the first two milestones .
we did n't lose them technically . the fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let von braun fly it --
you can argue that 's not a technical loss .
sputnik was n't a technical loss , but it was a prestige loss .
america -- the world saw america as not being the leader in technology , and that was a very strong thing .
and then we flew alan shepherd weeks after gagarin , not months or decades , or whatever . so we had the capability .
but america lost . we lost . and because of that , we made a big jump to recover it .
well , again , what 's interesting here is we 've lost to the russians on the first couple of milestones already .
you cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in america --
ca n't do it . you can buy it in russia .
you can fly with russian hardware . this is available because a russian space program is starving ,
and it 's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats .
it 's commercial . it can be defined as space tourism . they are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon , like apollo 8 was done .
100 million bucks -- hey , i can go to the moon .
but , you know , would you have thought back in the '60s , when the space race was going on , that the first commercial capitalist - like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in russian hardware ?
and would you have thought , would the russians have thought , that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware , the guys inside wo n't be russians ? maybe it 'll probably be a japanese or an american billionaire ? well , that 's weird : you know , it really is .
but anyway , i think we need to beat them again .
i think what we 'll do is we 'll see a successful , very successful , private space flight industry . whether we 're first or not really does n't matter .
the russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the concorde .
and then they flew a few cargo flights , and took it out of service .
i think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered .
ok , we 'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight .
this little thing says here : five times what nasa 's doing by 2020 . i want to tell you , already there 's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already , worldwide . if you read -- if you google it , you 'll find about half of that money , but there 's twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet , but being committed and planned for the next few years . hey , that 's pretty big .
i 'm predicting , though , as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost , or less -- this is going to be very profitable .
i predict , also , that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the u.s. taxpayer spends for nasa 's manned spacecraft work .
and every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15. and what that means is before we know it , the progress in human space flight , with no taxpayer dollars , will be at a level of about five times as much as the current nasa budgets for human space flight .
and that is because it 's us . it 's private industry .
you should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --
and we 've done it for a long time . the naca , before nasa , never developed an airliner and never ran an airline .
but nasa is developing the space liner , always has , and runs the only space line , ok . and we 've shied away from it because we 're afraid of it . but starting back in june of 2004 , when i showed that a little group out there actually can do it , can get a start with it , everything changed after that time .
ok , thank you very much .
