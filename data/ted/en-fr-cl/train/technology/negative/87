you know , when chris first approached me to speak at ted , i said no ,
because i felt like i was n't going to be able to make that personal connection , you know , that i wanted to . it 's such a large conference .
but he explained to me that he was in a bind , and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for -- so i said fine , ted -- i mean chris . i 'll come on two conditions . one -- i want to speak as early in the morning as possible .
and two -- i want to pick the theme for ted 2006 . and luckily he agreed . and the theme , in two years , is going to be " cute pictures of puppies . "
i invented the placebo camera .
it does n't actually take pictures , but it 's a hell of a lot cheaper ,
and you still feel like you were there .
" dear sir , good day , compliments of the day , and my best wishes
to you and family . i know this letter will come to you surprisingly , but let it not be a surprise to you ,
for nature has a way of arriving unannounced ,
and , as an adage says , originals are very hard to find ,
but their echoes sound louder . so i decided to contact you myself , for you to assure me of safety and honesty , if i have to entrust any amount of money under your custody .
i am mister michael bangoora , the son of late mister tiamu bangoora -- who was the minister of finance in sierra leone -- but was killed during a civil war .
knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment , and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business , on which premise i write you .
before my father death , he had the sum of 23 million united states dollars , which he kept away from the rebel leaders
during the course of the war .
this fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country , before the outbreak of war . when the war broke out , the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him ,
my father insisted it was not in his possession , and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund .
meanwhile , my mother and i is the only person who knows about the fund because my father always confide in me .
i quickly made an arrangement with a red cross relief worker , who used his official van to transport the money to lungi airport , freetown , although he did not know the real contents of the box .
the fund was deposited as a family reassure , in a safe , reliable security company in dakar , senegal ,
where i was only given temporary asylum .
i do not wish to invest the money in senegal due to unfavorable economic climate , and so close to my country .
the only assistance i need from you , which i know you would do for me , are the following : one , be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust ; two , provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted ; three , receive the funds into your account in trust ; take out your commission ; and leave the rest of the money until i arrive , after the transfer is complete .
sincerely , mister michael bangoora . " this is really embarrassing .
i was told backstage that i have 18 minutes .
i only prepared 15 .
so if it 's cool , i 'd like to just wait for three .
i 'm really sorry .
what 's your name ?
mark serfaas . it 's pretty cool , huh ? pursuing happiness .
are you a virgin ? virgin ?
i mean -- no , i mean like in the ted sense ?
are you ? oh , yeah . so what are you ,
like , a thousand , two thousand , somewhere in there ? huh ? oh ?
you do n't know what i 'm talking about ?
ah , mark -- serfaas .
1,860 -- am i good ?
and that 's nothing to be ashamed of .
that 's nothing to be ashamed of .
yeah , i was hanging out with some google guys last night .
really cool , we were getting wasted .
and they were telling me that google software has gotten so advanced that , based on your interaction with google over your lifetime , they can actually predict what you are going to say next .
and i was like , " get the fuck out of here . that 's crazy . " but they said , " no , but do n't show anyone , " but they slipped up . and they said that i could just type in " what was i going to say next ? " and my name , and it would tell me . and i have to tell you , right now , this is an unadulterated piece of software , this is a real internet browser and this is an actual google site , and we 're going to test it out live today .
what was i going to say next ? and " ze frank " -- that 's me .
am i feeling lucky ?
am i feeling lucky ?
audience : yes .
ze frank : oh . amazing .
in march of 2001 -- i filmed myself dancing to madonna 's " justify my love . "
on a thursday , i sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to 17 of my closest friends , as part of my -- an invitation to my -- an invitation to my th --
th -- 26th birthday party .
by monday , over a million people
were coming to this site a day .
within a week , i received a call from earthlink that said , due to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge , i owed them 30,000 dollars .
needless to say , i was able to leave my job .
and , finally , you know , become freelance .
but some people refer to me more of -- as , like , an internet guru or -- swami .
i -- i knew i had something .
i 'd basically distilled a very difficult - to - explain and complex philosophy , which i wo n't get into here , because it 's a little too deep for all of you , but -- it 's about what makes websites popular , and , you know , it 's -- it 's unfortunate that i do n't have more time .
maybe i can come back next year , or something like that .
i 'm obsessed with email . i get a lot of it .
four years later , i still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people i do n't know , and it 's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures , you know ?
it 's like a microscope to the rest of the world .
you can kind of peer into other people 's lives , and i also feel like i get a lot of inspiration
from the average user .
for example , somebody wrote me . they said , " hey ze , if you ever come to boulder , you should rock out with us , " and i said , " why wait ? " and they said , " hey ze , thanks for rocking out , but i meant the kind of rocking out where we 'd be naked . " and that was embarrassing . but you know , it 's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans , so i said , " sure . " i hear a lot of you whispering .
and i know what you 're saying . you 're saying , " holy crap , how is his presentation so smooth ? " and i have to say that it 's not all me this year .
i guess chris has to take some credit here , because in years past , i guess there 's been some sort of subpar speakers at ted . i do n't know .
and so , this year , chris sent us a ted conference simulator .
which really allowed us as speakers to get there , in the trenches , and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience .
and i gotta say that , you know , it 's really , really great to be here .
i 'd like to tell all of you a little joke . not just the good stuff , though .
you can do heckler mode . voice : hey , moron , get off the stage .
zf : you get off the stage .
voice : we want malcolm gladwell .
in case you run over time . i 'd -- just one last thing i 'd like to say , i 'd , really -- like to thank all of you for being here .
and frog mode .
" ah , the first time that i made love to a rock shrimp . . . "
it 's true . some people say to me , they say , " ze , you 're doing all this stuff , this internet stuff , and you 're not making any money .
" why ? " and i say , " mom , dad -- " i 'm trying . " you know , i do n't know if you 're all aware of this , but the video -- the video game market , kids are playing these video games , oh , but , supposedly , there 's tons of money . i mean , like , i think , 100,000 dollars or so a year is being spent
on these things . so i decided to try my hand .
i came up with a few games .
this is called " atheist . "
i figured it 'd be popular with the young kids .
look , i 'll move around and say some things .
so that did n't go over so well .
i do n't really understand why you 're laughing .
should have done this before i tried to pitch it .
" buddhist , " of course , looks very , very similar to " atheist . "
but you come back as a duck .
and this is great because , you know , for a quarter ,
you can play this for a long time .
and chris had said in an email that , you know , we should really bring something new to ted ,
something that we have n't shown anyone .
so , i made this for ted . it 's " christian . "
it 's the third in the series .
i 'm hoping it 's going to do well this year .
do you have a preference ? good choice .
so you can wait for the second coming -- which is -- a random number between one and 500 million .
so really , what are we talking about here ? oh , tech joy .
tech joy , to me , means something ,
because i get a lot of joy out of tech .
and in fact , making things using technology -- and i 'm being serious here , even though i 'm using my sarcastic voice --
i wo n't -- hold on . making things , you know --
making things actually does give me a lot of joy .
it 's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life , and it 's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do , but it 's not finished , and you 're not starting something -- that really fills my entire life .
and so , what i 've done is , i started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who do n't consider themselves artists .
we 're in a culture of guru - ship . it 's so hard to use some software because , you know , it 's unapproachable ,
people feel like they have to read the manual .
so i try to -- -- i try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves , and , hopefully -- whoa , i 'm like -- on the page , but it does n't exist .
it 's , like -- seriously , though -- i try to create meaningful environments
for people to express themselves .
here i created a contest called , " when office supplies attack , " which , i think , really resonated with the -- working population .
over 500 entries in three weeks , toilet paper fashion .
again , people from all over the country doing --
the watch is particularly incredible .
online drawing tools -- you 've probably seen a lot of them .
i think they 're wonderful .
i think it 's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff . but i 'm interested in the process , the process of creating , as the real event that i 'm interested in .
and the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing ,
and they get bummed out at this , sort of , you know , stick figure , awful little thing that they created .
and eventually , it just makes them stop playing with it ,
or draw , you know , they draw penises and things like that .
so , the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool .
in other words , it 's a helping tool .
you can draw your simple stick figure , and then it collaborates with you to create , sort of , like , a post - war german etching .
so you can -- in fact , it 's tuned to be better at drawing things
that look worse . so , we go ahead , and we start scribbling , and --
so the idea is that you can really , you know , partake in this process , but watch something really crappy look beautiful .
and here are some of my favorites . this is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me . here we are , very cool .
darling . beautiful stuff .
i mean this is incredible . this is an 11 - year - old girl -- drew this
and submitted it . it 's just gorgeous .
i 'm -- i 'm dead serious here . i 'm actually -- this is not a joke .
but , i think , it 's a -- it 's a really fun and wonderful thing .
so this is called the " fiction project . " this is an online space , which is -- it 's basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing .
these are haikus .
none of the haikus were written by the same person , and in fact , no line was -- you know , each line is contributed by a different person
at a different -- at a different time .
i think that the " now tied up , tied down , mistress cruel approaches me , now tied down , it 's up . " it 's -- it 's an amazing way , and i 'll tell you ,
if you come home , and your spouse , or whoever it is , says , " let 's talk " -- that , like , chills you to the very core .
but it 's peripheral activities , like these , that allow people to get together , doing fun things . they actually get to know each other , and it 's sort of like low - threshold peripheral activities that i think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital
that we 're lacking . and very , very quickly --
i love puppets . here 's a puppet .
it dances to music . lotte reiniger ,
an amazing shadow puppeteer in the '20s ,
that started doing more elaborate things .
i became interested in puppets ,
and i just want to show one last thing to you .
oh , this is how you make puppets .
chris anderson : ladies and gentlemen , mr. ze frank .
