probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to africa in the 1900s .
they were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes ,
and they wrote telegrams back to manchester .
and one of them wrote , " situation hopeless . stop .
they do n't wear shoes . " and the other one wrote , " glorious opportunity .
they do n't have any shoes yet . " now , there 's a similar situation in the classical music world , because there are some people who think that classical music is dying .
and there are some of us who think you ai n't seen nothing yet .
and rather than go into statistics and trends , and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing , and the record companies that are folding , i thought we should do an experiment tonight -- an experiment . actually , it 's not really an experiment , because i know the outcome .
but it 's like an experiment . now , before we -- -- before we start , i need to do two things .
one is i want to remind you of what a seven - year - old child sounds like when he plays the piano .
maybe you have this child at home .
he sounds something like this .
i see some of you recognize this child .
now , if he practices for a year and takes lessons , he 's now eight and he sounds like this .
then he practices for another year and takes lessons -- now he 's nine .
then he practices for another and takes lessons -- now he 's 10 .
at that point , they usually give up .
now , if you 'd waited , if you 'd waited for one more year , you would have heard this . now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , he suddenly became passionate , engaged , involved , got a new teacher , he hit puberty , or whatever it is .
what actually happened was the impulses were reduced .
you see , the first time , he was playing with an impulse on every note .
and the second , with an impulse every other note .
you can see it by looking at my head .
the nine - year - old put an impulse on every four notes .
and the 10 - year - old , on every eight notes .
and the 11 - year - old , one impulse on the whole phrase .
i know -- i do n't know how we got into this position .
i did n't say , " i 'm going to move my shoulder over , move my body . "
no , the music pushed me over ,
which is why i call it one - buttock playing . it can be the other buttock .
you know , a gentleman was once watching a presentation i was doing , when i was working with a young pianist .
he was the president of a corporation in ohio .
and i was working with this young pianist and i said , " the trouble with you is you 're a two - buttock player .
you should be a one - buttock player . "
and i moved his body like that , while he was playing .
and suddenly , the music took off . it took flight .
there was a gasp in the audience when they heard the difference .
and then i got a letter from this gentleman .
he said , " i was so moved . i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one - buttock company . "
now , the other thing i wanted to do is to tell you about you .
there are 1,600 people , i believe .
my estimation is that probably 45 of you are absolutely passionate about classical music .
you adore classical music . your fm is always on that classical dial .
and you have cds in your car , and you go to the symphony .
and your children are playing instruments .
you ca n't imagine your life without classical music .
that 's the first group ; it 's quite a small group .
then there 's another group , bigger group .
these are the people who do n't mind classical music .
you know , you 've come home from a long day , and you take a glass of wine , and you put your feet up .
a little vivaldi in the background does n't do any harm .
that 's the second group .
now comes the third group .
these are the people who never listen to classical music .
it 's just simply not part of your life .
you might hear it like second - hand smoke at the airport , but -- -- and maybe a little bit of a march from " aida "
when you come into the hall . but otherwise , you never hear it .
that 's probably the largest group of all .
and then there 's a very small group .
these are the people who think they 're tone - deaf .
amazing number of people think they 're tone - deaf .
actually , i hear a lot , " my husband is tone - deaf . "
actually , you cannot be tone - deaf . nobody is tone - deaf .
if you were tone - deaf , you could n't change the gears on your car , in a stick shift car .
you could n't tell the difference between somebody from texas and somebody from rome .
and the telephone . the telephone . if your mother calls on the miserable telephone , she calls and says , " hello , " you not only know who it is , you know what mood she 's in .
you have a fantastic ear . everybody has a fantastic ear . so nobody is tone - deaf .
but i tell you what . it does n't work for me to go on with this thing , with such a wide gulf between those who understand , love and [ are ] passionate about classical music , and those who have no relationship to it at all .
the tone - deaf people , they 're no longer here .
but even between those three categories , it 's too wide a gulf .
so i 'm not going to go on until every single person in this room , downstairs and in aspen , and everybody else looking , will come to love and understand classical music .
so that 's what we 're going to do .
now , you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work if you look at my face , right ?
it 's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he 's leading to realize whatever he 's dreaming .
imagine if martin luther king had said , " i have a dream . of course , i 'm not sure they 'll be up to it . "
all right . so i 'm going to take a piece of chopin . this is a beautiful prelude by chopin . some of you will know it .
do you know what i think probably happened in this room ?
when i started , you thought , " how beautiful that sounds . "
" i do n't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year . "
it 's funny , is n't it ? it 's funny how those thoughts kind of waft into your head .
and of course -- -- and of course , if the piece is long and you 've had a long day , you might actually drift off .
then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say , " wake up ! it 's culture ! " and then you feel even worse .
but has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you , but because of us ?
did anybody think while i was playing , " why is he using so many impulses ? "
if i 'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it .
and for the rest of your life , every time you hear classical music , you 'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses .
so let 's see what 's really going on here . we have a b. this is a b. the next note is a c.
and the job of the c is to make the b sad . and it does , does n't it ?
composers know that . if they want sad music , they just play those two notes .
but basically , it 's just a b , with four sads .
now , it goes down to a. now to g. and then to f.
so we have b , a , g , f. and if we have b , a , g , f , what do we expect next ? oh , that might have been a fluke .
let 's try it again . ooh , the ted choir .
and you notice nobody is tone - deaf , right ? nobody is .
you know , every village in bangladesh and every hamlet in china -- everybody knows :
da , da , da , da -- da . everybody knows , who 's expecting that e.
now , chopin did n't want to reach the e there , because what will have happened ? it will be over , like hamlet . do you remember hamlet ? act one , scene three , he finds out that his uncle killed his father .
you remember , he keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him . and then he backs away , and he goes up to him again and almost kills him .
and the critics , all of whom are sitting in the back row there , they have to have an opinion , so they say , " hamlet is a procrastinator . "
or they say , " hamlet has an oedipus complex . "
no , otherwise the play would be over , stupid .
that 's why shakespeare puts all that stuff in hamlet --
you know , ophelia going mad and the play within the play , and yorick 's skull , and the gravediggers .
that 's in order to delay -- until act five , he can kill him .
it 's the same with the chopin . he 's just about to reach the e , and he says , " oops , better go back up and do it again . "
so he does it again .
now , he gets excited . that 's excitement ,
you do n't have to worry about it .
now , he gets to f - sharp , and finally he goes down to e , but it 's the wrong chord -- because the chord he 's looking for is this one , and instead he does ... now , we call that a deceptive cadence , because it deceives us . i always tell my students , " if you have a deceptive cadence , be sure to raise your eyebrows . then everybody will know . "
right . so , he gets to e , but it 's the wrong chord .
now , he tries e again . that chord does n't work .
now , he tries the e again . that chord does n't work .
now , he tries e again , and that does n't work .
there was a gentleman in the front row who went , " mmm . " it 's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day , turns off the key in his car and says , " aah , i 'm home . " because we all know where home is .
so this is a piece which goes from away to home .
and i 'm going to play it all the way through and you 're going to follow . b , c , b , c , b , c , b -- down to a , down to g , down to f.
almost goes to e , but otherwise the play would be over .
he goes back up to b. he gets very excited . goes to f - sharp . goes to e.
it 's the wrong chord . it 's the wrong chord . it 's the wrong chord .
and finally goes to e , and it 's home .
and what you 're going to see is one - buttock playing .
because for me , to join the b to the e , i have to stop thinking about every single note along the way , and start thinking about the long , long line from b to e.
you know , we were just in south africa , and you ca n't go to south africa without thinking of mandela in jail for 27 years .
what was he thinking about ? lunch ?
no , he was thinking about the vision for south africa and for human beings . that 's what kept -- this is about vision . this is about the long line .
like the bird who flies over the field and does n't care about the fences underneath , all right ?
so now , you 're going to follow the line all the way from b to e.
and i 've one last request before i play this piece all the way through . would you think of somebody who you adore , who 's no longer there ?
a beloved grandmother , a lover -- somebody in your life who you love with all your heart , but that person is no longer with you .
bring that person into your mind , and at the same time follow the line all the way from b to e , and you 'll hear everything that chopin had to say .
now , you may be wondering , you may be wondering why i 'm clapping . well , i did this at a school in boston with about 70 seventh graders , 12 - year - olds . and i did exactly what i did with you , and i told them and explained them and the whole thing . and at the end , they went crazy , clapping . they were clapping . i was clapping . they were clapping .
finally , i said , " why am i clapping ? "
and one of the little kids said , " because we were listening . "
think of it . 1,600 people , busy people , involved in all sorts of different things , listening , understanding and being moved by a piece by chopin .
now that is something .
now , am i sure that every single person followed that , understood it , was moved by it ? of course , i ca n't be sure .
but i tell you what happened to me .
i was in ireland during the troubles , 10 years ago , and i was working with some catholic and protestant kids on conflict resolution . and i did this with them --
a risky thing to do , because they were street kids .
and one of them came to me the next morning and he said , " you know , i 've never listened to classical music in my life , but when you played that shopping piece ... "
he said , " my brother was shot last year and i did n't cry for him .
but last night , when you played that piece , he was the one i was thinking about .
and i felt the tears streaming down my face . and you know , it felt really good to cry for my brother . "
so i made up my mind at that moment that classical music is for everybody . everybody .
now , how would you walk -- because you know , my profession , the music profession does n't see it that way .
they say three percent of the population likes classical music . if only we could move it to four percent , our problems would be over .
i say , " how would you walk ? how would you talk ? how would you be ?
if you thought , three percent of the population likes classical music ,
if only we could move it to four percent . how would you walk ?
how would you talk ? how would you be ? if you thought , everybody loves classical music -- they just have n't found out about it yet . "
see , these are totally different worlds .
now , i had an amazing experience . i was 45 years old , i 'd been conducting for 20 years , and i suddenly had a realization . the conductor of an orchestra does n't make a sound . my picture appears on the front of the cd -- -- but the conductor does n't make a sound .
he depends , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful .
and that changed everything for me . it was totally life changing .
people in my orchestra came up to me and said , " ben , what happened ? " that 's what happened .
i realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people .
and of course , i wanted to know whether i was doing that .
and you know how you find out ? you look at their eyes .
if their eyes are shining , you know you 're doing it .
you could light up a village with this guy 's eyes .
right . so if the eyes are shining , you know you 're doing it .
if the eyes are not shining , you get to ask a question .
and this is the question : who am i being , that my players ' eyes are not shining ?
we can do that with our children , too .
who am i being , that my children 's eyes are not shining ?
that 's a totally different world .
now , we 're all about to end this magical , on - the - mountain week , and we 're going back into the world . and i say , it 's appropriate for us to ask the question , who are we being as we go back out into the world ?
and you know , i have a definition of success .
for me , it 's very simple . it 's not about wealth and fame and power . it 's about how many shining eyes i have around me .
that it really makes a difference what we say --
the words that come out of our mouth .
i learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz , one of the rare survivors .
she went to auschwitz when she was 15 years old , and her brother was eight , and the parents were lost .
and she told me this , she said , " we were in the train going to auschwitz , and i looked down and saw my brother 's shoes were missing .
and i said , ' why are you so stupid , ca n't you keep your things together for goodness ' sake ? ' " the way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother .
unfortunately , it was the last thing she ever said to him , because she never saw him again . he did not survive .
and so when she came out of auschwitz , she made a vow .
she told me this . she said , " i walked out of auschwitz into life and i made a vow . and the vow was , i will never say anything that could n't stand as the last thing i ever say . "
now , can we do that ? no. and we 'll make ourselves wrong
and others wrong . but it is a possibility to live into . thank you . shining eyes , shining eyes .
thank you , thank you .
