i started juggling a long time ago , but long before that , i was a golfer , and that 's what i was , a golfer .
and as a golfer and as a kid , one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores , that i sort of lived my whole life , is process .
and it 's the process of learning things .
one of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer , but he was lefty .
and he had a real passion for golf , and he also created this whole mythology about ben hogan and various things .
well , i learned a lot about interesting things that i knew nothing about at the time , but grew to know stuff about .
and that was the mythology of skill .
so , one of the things that i love to do is to explore skill .
and since richard put me on this whole thing with music -- i 'm supposed to actually be doing a project with tod machover with the mit media lab -- it relates a lot to music .
but tod could n't come and the project is sort of somewhere , i 'm not sure whether it 's happening the way we thought , or not .
but i 'm going to explore skill , and juggling , and basically visual music , i guess .
ok , you can start the music , thanks .
thanks . thank you . now , juggling can be a lot of fun ; play with skill and play with space , play with rhythm .
and you can turn the mike on now . i 'm going to do a couple of pieces .
i do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it .
part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand - oriented -- but using the rhythm of my body and feet , and controlling the balls with my feet .
thanks . now , this next section was an attempt to explore space .
you see , i think richard said something about people that are against something .
well , a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff .
well , i kind of , from my childhood and golf and all that , it 's a process of joining with forces .
and so what i 'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique .
so juggling gravity -- up , down .
if you figure out what up and down really are , it 's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything , but then you add in sideways .
now , i look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes , and see with your hands because you 're not looking at your hands , you 're looking at where the balls are or you 're looking at the audience .
so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm , with the obvious reference to the feet ,
but it 's also time -- where the feet were , where the balls were .
thanks . so , visual music : rhythm and complexity .
i 'm going to build towards complexity now .
juggling three balls is simple and normal .
excuse me .
we 're jugglers , ok . and remember , you 're transposing , you 're getting into a subculture here .
and juggling -- the balls cross and all that .
ok , if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights , but then hopefully even rhythm .
and you can change the rhythm -- good , michael .
you can change the rhythm , if you get out of the lights .
ok ? change the rhythm , so it 's even . or you can go back and change the height . now , skill .
but you 're boxed in , if you can only do it up and down that way .
so , you 've got to go after the space down there .
ok , then you 've got to combine them , because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you .
and then you get crazy .
now , i 'm actually going to ask you to try something , so you 've got to pay attention . complexity :
if you spend enough time doing something , time slows down or your skill increases , so your perceptions change .
it 's learning skills -- like being in a high - speed car crash .
things slow down as you learn , as you learn , as you learn .
you may not be able to affect it , it almost drifts on you . it goes .
but that 's the closest approximation i can have to it .
so , complexity . now , how many here are jugglers ?
ok , so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this .
ok ? and whoever laughed there -- you understood it completely , right ?
no , it looks like a mess . it looks like a mess with a guy there , who 's got his hands around that mess , ok .
well , that 's what juggling is about , right ?
it 's being able to do something that other people ca n't do or ca n't understand .
all right . so , that 's one way of doing it , which is five balls down .
ok ? another way is the outside .
and you could play with the rhythm .
same pattern .
make it faster and smaller .
make it wider .
make it narrower .
bring it back up .
ok . it 's done . thanks .
now , what i wanted to get to is that you 're all very bright , very tactile .
i have no idea how computer - oriented or three - dimensionally - oriented you are , but let 's try something .
ok , so since you all do n't understand what the five - ball pattern is , i 'm going to give you a little clue .
enough of a clue ? so , you get the pattern , right ? ok .
you 're not getting off that easy . all right ?
now , do me a favor : follow the ball that i ask you to follow .
green .
yellow .
pink .
white .
ok , you can do that ? yeah ? ok .
now , let 's actually learn something .
actually , let me put you in that area of learning , which is very insecure .
you want to do it ? yeah ? ok .
hands out in front of you . palms up , together .
what you 're going to learn is this .
ok ? so what i want you to do is just listen to me and do it .
index finger , middle finger , ring , little .
little , ring , middle , index . and then open .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
a little bit faster .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
all right . a lot of different learning processes going on in here .
one learning process that i see is this -- ok . another learning process that i see is this -- ok . so , everybody take a deep breath in , breath out . ok .
now , one more time , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . ok .
shake your hands out .
now , i assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer .
ok ? so , what you 're doing is , you 're going la , la , la , and you 're getting this . ok ?
so that 's exactly what i 'm going to ask you to do , but in a slightly different way . you 're going to combine it .
so what i want you to do is -- fingers . i 'll tell you what to do with your fingers , same thing .
but i want you to do is also , with your eyes , is follow the colored ball that i ask you to follow .
ok ? here we go .
so , we 're going to start off looking at the white ball -- and i 'm going to tell you which color , and i 'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers . ok ?
so white ball and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . pink .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . green .
finger , finger , finger , finger . yellow .
finger , finger , finger , pink or finger .
pink , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
all right .
how did you do ? well ? ok . the reason i wanted you to do this is because that 's actually what most people face throughout their lives , a moment of learning , a moment of challenge .
it 's a moment that you ca n't make sense of .
why the hell should i learn this ? ok ?
does it really have anything to do with anything in my life ?
you know , i ca n't decipher -- is it fun ? is it challenging ? am i supposed to cheat ?
you know , what are you supposed to do ?
you 've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life . ok ?
trying to figure that stuff out . but is it going to get you anywhere ?
it 's just a moment . that 's all it is , a moment . ok ?
i 'm going to change the script for one second . just let me do this .
i do n't need music for it . talking about time in a moment . there 's a piece that i recently developed which was all about that , a moment . and what i do as a creative artist is i develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects .
what i 've done for you here , i developed a lot of those tricks and i put the choreography together , but they 're not original techniques .
now , i 'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that i 've developed . ok ?
so , a moment , how would you define a moment ?
well , as a juggler , what i wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment .
ahhh .
all right , i 'm going to get on my knees and do it .
so , a moment .
ok ? and then , what i did as a juggler was say , ok , what can i do to make that something that is dependent on something else , another dynamic .
so , a moment .
another moment .
excuse me , still getting there . a moment that travels .
a moment -- no , we 'll try that again . it separates , and comes back together .
time . how can you look at time ?
and what do you dedicate it to , in exploring a particular thing ?
well , obviously , there 's something in here , and you can all have a guess as to what it is .
there 's a mystery . there 's a mystery in the moment .
and it has to settle . and then it 's dependent on something else .
and then it comes to rest . just a little thing about time .
now , this has expanded into a much bigger piece ,
because i use ramps of different parabolas that i roll the balls on while i 'm keeping time with this .
but i just thought i 'd talk about a moment .
all right . ok . can we show the video of the triangle ?
are we ready to do that ? yes ?
this is the piece that i told you about .
it 's a much bigger piece that i do exploring the space of a geometric triangle .
thanks . the only thing i 'll say about the last session is , you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at 120 miles an hour ?
the only other thing is , it was a real shock . i always drove motorcycles . and when i bought my first car , it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents ' house . interesting .
anyway , balance : constant movement to find an approach to stillness .
cheating .
balance : making up the rules so you ca n't cheat , so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body .
to have a conversation with it . to speak . to listen .
hup . now , it 's dependent on rhythm , and keeping a center of balance . when it falls , going underneath .
so , there 's a rhythm to it .
the rhythm can get much smaller . as your skill increases , you learn to find those tinier spaces , those tinier movements . thanks .
now , i 'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways , and also -- oh , actually , if you 're bored , not here , here 's one use for it .
you can go with the " sticks one " music .
thanks . that has a certain kind of balance to it , which is all about plumb .
i apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb , square and level .
and they influenced that , and this next piece , which i 'll do a little segment of .
" two sticks , " you can go with it . thanks .
which is again exploring space , or the lines in space .
working with space and the lines in space in a different way .
oh , let 's see here .
so , i 'll come back to that in a second . but working with one ball , now , what if you attach something to it , or change it .
this is a little thing that i made because i really like the idea of curves and balls together .
and then creating space and the rhythm of space , using the surface of the balls , the surface of the arms .
just a little toy . which leads me to the next thing , which is -- what have i got here ? ok . all right .
i 'm actually leading up to something , the newest thing that i 'm working on . this is not it .
this is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape .
now , what i just did was i worked with the mathematics -- the diameter and the circumference .
sometimes these pieces are mathematical , in that way that i look at a shape and say , what about if i use this and this and this .
sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that i try to work with .
the next piece that i 'm going to do -- which is the cylinders piece , if you want to get that up -- it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago , which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs . i love ceramics and all of that .
it 's a combination of that , the beauty of that , the shape , and the stories that were involved in it , as well as the fact that they protected the contents .
the second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness .
so , if you want to go with the music for cylinders .
talking about geometry and everything , if you take the circle and you split it in half --
can you run " s - curve music ? "
i 'm going to do just a short version of it .
circles split in half and rotated , and mythology .
anyway , that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it , and i dance around a small stage so -- two minutes , just to end ? the latest piece that i 'm working on -- what i love is that i never know what i 'm working on , why i 'm working on it .
they 're not ideas , they 're instincts .
and the latest thing that i 'm working on -- -- is something really -- i do n't know what it is yet .
and that 's good . i like not to know for as long as possible .
well , because then it tells me the truth , instead of me imposing the truth .
and what it is , is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves .
and what it involves , and i do n't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not , but i 'll do a little bit of it .
it initially started off with me stacking these things , bunches of them , and then playing with the sense of space , of filling in the space . and then it started changing , and become folding on themselves .
and then changing levels .
because my attempt is to make visual instruments , not to just make -- i 'll try one other thing . for work in three dimensions , with your perceptions of space and time .
now , i do n't know exactly where it 's going , but i 've got a bit of effort involved in this thing .
and it 's going to change as i go through it .
but i really like it , it feels right .
this may not be the right shape , and -- look at this shape , and then i 'll show you the first design i ever put to it , just to see , just to play , because i love all different kinds of things to play with .
to work with the positive and negative in a different way .
and to change , and to change .
so , i 'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space .
we 'll see what i come up with . thanks for having me .
