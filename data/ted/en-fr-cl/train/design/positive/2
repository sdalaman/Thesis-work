in terms of invention , i 'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects .
i think it 's one of the most exciting that i 'm working on , but i think it 's also the simplest .
it 's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world .
it addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet , the number one cause of death in children under five , which is ... ? water - borne diseases ? diarrhea ? malnutrition ?
no , it 's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections caused by this . can you believe that ?
i find this shocking and somewhat appalling .
ca n't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels ?
ca n't we make better stoves ?
how is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year ?
i know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes ,
so i 'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro - tubes , which is charcoal .
so this is a picture of rural haiti . haiti is now 98 percent deforested . you 'll see scenes like this all over the island .
it leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation .
a couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that 's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil .
so the rains come , they go down the rivers , and the flooding happens .
now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this : people need to cook , and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it .
it 's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage . they know perfectly well , but they have no other choice .
fossil fuels are not available , and solar energy does n't cook the way that they like their food prepared .
and so this is what they do . you 'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree , cut it down and make charcoal out of it .
so not surprisingly , there 's a lot of effort that 's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels .
about four years ago i took a team of students down to haiti , and we worked with peace corps volunteers there .
this is one such volunteer , and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked .
and the idea was that you could take waste paper ; you could compress it ; and make briquettes that could be used for fuel .
but this device was very slow .
so our engineering students went to work on it , and with some very simple changes , they were able to triple the throughput of this device .
so you could imagine they were very excited about it .
and they took the briquettes back to mit so that they could test them . and one of the things that they found was they did n't burn . so it was a little discouraging to the students .
and in fact if you look closely , right here , you can see it says , " u.s. peace corps . "
as it turns out , there actually was n't any waste paper in this village .
and while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village , it was 800 kilometers away .
and so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel .
what we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level .
you see these all over haiti as well . they 're small - scale sugar mills .
and the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called " bagasse . "
it has no other use . it has no nutritional value , so they do n't feed it to the animals .
it just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it .
what we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with , something like charcoal .
so over the next couple of years , students and i worked to develop a process .
so you start with the bagasse , and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five - gallon oil drum .
after some time , after setting it on fire , you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln , and then you end up with this carbonized material here .
however , you ca n't burn this . it 's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking .
so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes .
and conveniently , one of my students was from ghana , and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called " kokonte , " which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root .
and so what we did was we looked , and we found that cassava is indeed grown in haiti , under the name of " manioc . " and in fact , it 's grown all over the world -- yucca , tapioca , manioc , cassava , it 's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable .
and you can make a very thick , sticky porridge out of it , which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes .
so we did this . we went down to haiti .
these are the graduates of the first ecole de chabon , or charcoal institute . and these --
-- that 's right . so i 'm actually an instructor at mit as well as cit.
and these are the briquettes that we made .
now i 'm going to take you to a different continent . this is india , and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in india ; it 's cow dung .
and more than in haiti , this produces really smoky fires , and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel .
kids and women are especially affected by it , because they 're the ones who are around the cooking fires .
so we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal - making technology there .
well unfortunately , they did n't have sugarcane and they did n't have cassava , but that did n't stop us .
what we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass .
and there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area .
and what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure , which they used ordinarily for their fuel .
and we did side - by - side tests , and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung . and you can see that it 's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel .
and in fact , it heats the water a lot more quickly .
and so we were very happy , thus far .
but one of the things that we found was when we did side - by - side comparisons with wood charcoal , it did n't burn as long . and the briquettes crumbled a little bit , and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking .
so we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in haiti .
so we went back to mit , we took out the instron machine , and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level and at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this , we also had community partners in haiti working to develop the process , to improve it and to make it more accessible to people in the villages there .
and after some time , we developed a low - cost press that allows you to produce charcoal , which actually now burns longer , cleaner than wood charcoal .
so now we 're in a situation where we have a product , which is actually better than what you can buy in haiti in the marketplace , which is a very wonderful place to be .
in haiti alone , about 30 million trees are cut down every year .
there 's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those .
in addition , the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars . that 's an awful lot for a country of haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars .
so this is where we 're also moving ahead with our charcoal project . and one of the things that i think is also interesting , is i have a friend up at uc berkeley who 's been doing risk analysis .
and he 's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal . and he 's found that worldwide , you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel . that 's remarkable ,
but up until now , there were n't ways to do it without cutting down trees .
but now we have a way that 's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel .
one of the really exciting things , though , is something that came out of the trip that i took to ghana just last month . and this is , i think , the coolest thing ,
and it 's even lower tech than what you just saw , so what is this ? this is corncobs turned into charcoal .
and the beauty of this is that you do n't need to form briquettes --
it comes ready made . this is my $ 100 laptop , right here .
and actually , like nick , i brought samples .
so we can pass these around .
they 're fully functional , field - tested , ready to roll out .
and i think one of the things , which is also remarkable about this technology , is that the technology transfer is so easy . compared to the sugarcane charcoal , where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder , this comes pre - briquetted .
and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now , which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life .
but once you see it , like you guys in the front row , all right ,
yeah , ok . so anyway --
-- here it is . and this is i think a perfect example of what robert wright was talking about in those non - zero - sum things .
so not only do you have health benefits , you have environmental benefits . but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .
people can make their own cooking fuel from waste products . they can generate income from this .
they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal , and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who are n't making their own .
it 's really rare that you do n't have trade - offs between health and economics , or environment and economics .
so this is a project that i just find extremely exciting , and i 'm really looking forward to see where it takes us .
so when we talk about , now , the future we will create , one of the things that i think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in .
and now i do n't actually mean the world that we live in . i mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat .
i mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand , and where , when you work 10 hours a day , you 're still only earning 60 dollars in a month .
i mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water . that 's as if the entire workforce of the state of california worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water .
it 's a place where , for example , if this were india , in this room , only three of us would have a car .
if this were afghanistan , only one person in this room would know how the use the internet .
if this were zambia , 300 of you would be farmers , 100 of you would have aids or hiv . and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day .
these are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for .
these are the issues that we need to be training our engineers , our designers , our business people , our entrepreneurs to be facing .
these are the solutions that we need to find .
i have a few areas that i believe are especially important that we address . one of them is creating technologies to promote micro - finance and micro - enterprise , so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they 're not doing it using the same traditional basket making , poultry rearing , etc.
but there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale .
the next thing i believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops .
and we need to rethink our development strategies , so that we 're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers , but rather to stop being poor farmers . and we need to think about how we can do that effectively .
we need to work with the people in these communities , and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems . that 's the best way to do it . we should n't be doing it from outside .
so we need to create this future , and we need to start doing it now .
thank you .
chris anderson : tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you 've worked on .
amy smith : a couple of other things that we 're working on are looking at ways to do low - cost water quality testing , so that communities can maintain their own water systems , know when they 're working , know when they treat them , etc.
we 're also looking at low - cost water treatment systems .
one of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that .
ca : what 's the bottleneck to preventing this stuff getting from scale ?
do you need to find entrepreneurs , or venture capitalists ,
or what do you need to take what you 've got and get it to scale ?
as : yeah , i think its large numbers of people moving it forward .
it 's a difficult thing ; it 's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income .
so you ca n't use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward .
and we 're a pretty small staff , which is me .
so , you know , i do what i can with the students . we have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward .
the other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame , as -- you know , you ca n't expect to get something done in a year or two years ; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead .
but i think with the vision to do that , we can move forward .
