my name is lovegrove . i only know nine lovegroves , two of which are my parents .
they are first cousins , and you know what happens when , you know -- so there 's a terribly weird freaky side to me , which i 'm fighting with all the time . so to try and get through today , i 've kind of disciplined myself with an 18 - minute talk .
i was hanging on to have a pee .
i thought perhaps if i was hanging on long enough , that would guide me through the 18 minutes .
okay . i am known as captain organic , and that 's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position .
but today what i 'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people 's soul and emotion .
not very long ago , not many thousands of years ago , we actually lived in caves , and i do n't think we 've lost that coding system .
we respond so well to form , but i 'm interested in creating intelligent form .
i 'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design .
these -- this artificially induced consumerism -- i think it 's atrocious .
my world is the world of people like amory lovins , janine benyus , james watson .
i 'm in that world , but i work purely instinctively .
i 'm not a scientist . i could have been , perhaps , but i work in this world where i trust my instincts .
so i am a 21st - century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with .
and we should be developing things -- we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people 's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use .
so , the water bottle .
i 'll begin with this concept of what i call dna .
dna : design , nature , art . these are the three things that condition my world .
here is a drawing by leonardo da vinci , 500 years ago , before photography .
it shows how observation , curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art .
industrial design is the art form of the 21st century .
people like leonardo -- there have not been many -- had this amazingly instinctive curiosity .
i work from a similar position .
i do n't want to sound pretentious saying that , but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago -- well into the 21st century , 500 years later .
it 's my impression of water .
impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it : 100 million dollars , easily , for a monet .
i use , now , a whole new process .
a few years ago i reinvented my process to keep up with people like greg lynn , tom main , zaha hadid , rem koolhaas -- all these people that i think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form .
this is all created digitally .
here you see the machining , the milling of a block of acrylic .
this is what i show to the client to say , " that 's what i want to do . "
at that point , i do n't know if that 's possible at all .
it 's a seductor , but i just feel in my bones that that 's possible .
so we go . we look at the tooling . we look at how that is produced .
these are the invisible things that you never see in your life .
this is the background noise of industrial design .
that is like an anish kapoor flowing through a richard serra .
it is more valuable than the product in my eyes . i do n't have one .
when i do make some money , i 'll have one machined for myself .
this is the final product . when they sent it to me , i thought i 'd failed .
it felt like nothing . it has to feel like nothing .
it was when i put the water in that i realized that i 'd put a skin on water itself .
it 's an icon of water itself , and it elevates people 's perception of contemporary design .
each bottle is different , meaning the water level will give you a different shape .
it 's mass individualism from a single product . it fits the hand .
it fits arthritic hands . it fits children 's hands .
it makes the product strong , the tessellation .
it 's a millefiori of ideas .
in the future they will look like that , because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things , perhaps , in life .
biopolymers , these new ideas for materials , will come into play in probably a decade .
it does n't look as cool , does it ?
but i can live up to that . i do n't have a problem with that .
i design for that condition , biopolymers . it 's the future .
i took this video in cape town last year .
this is the freaky side coming out .
i have this special interest in things like this which blow my mind .
i do n't know whether to , you know , drop to my knees , cry ;
i do n't know what i think . but i just know that nature improves with ever - greater purpose that which once existed , and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking .
when i look at these things , they look pretty normal to me .
but these things evolved over many years , and now what we 're trying to do -- i get three weeks to design a telephone .
how the hell do i do a telephone in three weeks , when you get these things that take hundreds of million years to evolve ?
how do you condense that ?
it comes back to instinct .
i 'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that , and i 'm not looking at designing architecture like that .
i 'm just interested in natural growth patterns , and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates .
how that flows through me and how that comes out is what i 'm trying to understand .
this is a scan through the human forearm . it 's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal the cellular structure . i have these in my office .
my office is a mixture of the natural history museum and a nasa space lab.
it 's a weird , kind of freaky place .
this is one of my specimens .
this is made -- bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers .
i studied cooking in school for four years , and in that experience , which was called " domestic science , " it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification .
actually , i put marijuana in everything i cooked -- -- and i had access to all the best girls . it was fabulous .
all the guys in the rugby team could n't understand , but anyway -- this is a meringue . this is another sample i have .
a meringue is made exactly the same way , in my estimation , as a bone .
it 's made from polysaccharides and proteins .
if you pour water on that , it dissolves .
could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future ?
not a bad idea . i do n't know . i need to talk to janine and a few other people about that , but i believe instinctively that that meringue can become something , a car -- i do n't know .
i 'm also interested in growth patterns : the unbridled way that nature grows things so you 're not restricted by form at all .
these interrelated forms , they do inspire everything i do although i might end up making something incredibly simple .
this is a detail of a chair that i 've designed in magnesium .
it shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of kind of engineering and biological thinking , shown pretty much as a bone structure .
any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object .
it 's the world 's first chair made in magnesium .
it cost 1.7 million dollars to develop . it 's called " go " by bernhardt , usa .
it went into time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century .
boy . for somebody growing up in wales in a little village , that 's enough .
it shows how you make one holistic form , like the car industry , and then you break up what you need .
this is an absolutely beautiful way of working .
it 's a godly way of working .
it 's organic and it 's essential .
it 's an absolutely fat - free design , and when you look at it , you see human beings . bless you .
when that moves into polymers , you can change the elasticity , the fluidity of the form .
this is an idea for a gas - injected , one - piece polymer chair .
what nature does is it drills holes in things . it liberates form .
it takes away anything extraneous . that 's what i do .
i make organic things which are essential .
i do n't -- and they look funky too -- but i do n't set out to make funky things because i think that 's an absolute disgrace .
i set out to look at natural forms .
if you took the idea of fractal technology further , take a membrane , shrinking it down constantly like nature does -- that could be a seat for a chair ; it could be a sole for a sports shoe ; it could be a car blending into seats .
wow . let 's go for it . that 's the kind of stuff .
this is what exists in nature . observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day . that 's what i do .
this is a show that 's currently on in tokyo .
it 's called " superliquidity . " it 's my sculptural investigation .
it 's like 21st - century henry moore . when you see a henry moore still , your hair stands up . there 's some amazing spiritual connect .
if he was a car designer , phew , we 'd all be driving one .
in his day , he was the highest taxpayer in britain .
that is the power of organic design .
it contributes immensely to our sense of being , our sense of relationships with things , our sensuality and , you know , the sort of -- even the sort of socio - erotic side , which is very important .
this is my artwork . this is all my process .
these actually are sold as artwork .
they 're very big prints . but this is how i get to that object .
ironically , that object was made by the killarney process , which is a brand - new process here for the 21st century , and i can hear greg lynn laughing his socks off as i say that .
i 'll tell you about that later .
when i look into these data images , i see new things .
i 'm self -- it 's self - inspired . diatomic structures , radiolaria , the things that we could n't see but we can do now --
these , again , are cored out . they 're made virtually from nothing .
they 're made from silica . why not structures from cars like that ?
coral , all these natural forces , take away what they do n't need and they deliver maximum beauty .
we need to be in that realm . i want to do stuff like that .
this is a new chair which should come on the market in september .
it 's for a company called moroso in italy .
it 's a gas - injected polymer chair .
those holes you see there are very filtered - down , watered - down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures .
it goes with the flow of the polymer and you 'll see -- there 's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing .
it 's great to have companies in italy who support this way of dreaming .
if you see the shadows that come through that , they 're actually probably more important than the product , but it 's the minimum it takes .
the coring out of the back lets you breathe .
it takes away any material you do n't need and it actually garners flexure too , so -- i was going to break into a dance then .
this is some current work i 'm doing .
i 'm looking at single - surface structures and how they flow -- how they stretch and flow . it 's based on furniture typologies , but that 's not the end motivation . it 's made from aluminum , as opposed to aluminium , and it 's grown .
it 's grown in my mind , and then it 's grown in terms of the whole process that i go through .
this is two weeks ago in ccp in coventry , who build parts for bentleys and so on .
it 's being built as we speak , and it will be on show in phillips next year in new york .
i have a big show with phillips auctioneers .
when i see these animations , oh jesus , i 'm blown away .
this is what goes on in my studio everyday . i walk -- i 'm traveling . i come back .
some guy 's got that on a computer -- there 's this like , oh my goodness .
so i try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio .
this kind of effervescent , fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas .
single - surface products . furniture 's a good one .
how you grow legs out of a surface .
i would love to build this one day , and perhaps i 'd like to build it also out of flour , sugar , polymer , wood chips -- i do n't know , human hair . i do n't know . i 'd love a go at that .
i do n't know . if i just got some time .
that 's the weird side coming out again , and a lot of companies do n't understand that .
three weeks ago i was with sony in tokyo . they said , " give us the dream .
what is our dream ? how do we beat apple ? "
i said , " well you do n't copy apple , that 's for sure . "
i said , " you get into biopolymers . " they looked straight through me .
what a waste . anyway .
no , it 's true . fuck ' em . fuck ' em . you know , i mean .
i 'm delivering ; they 're not taking . i 've had this image 20 years .
i 've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years sitting on a hot bed .
that is an image of a car for me .
that 's the car of the future . it 's a water droplet .
i 've been banging on about this like i ca n't believe .
cars are all wrong .
i 'm going to show you something a bit weird now .
they laughed everywhere over the world i showed this .
the only place that did n't laugh was moscow .
its cars are made from 30,000 components .
how ridiculous is that ? could n't you make that from 300 ?
it 's got a vacuum - formed , carbon - nylon pan . everything 's holistically integrated .
it opens and closes like a bread bin .
there is no engine . there 's a solar panel on the back , and there are batteries in the wheels .
they 're fitted like formula one . you take them off your wall .
you plug them in . off you jolly well go .
a three - wheeled car : slow , feminine , transparent , so you can see the people in there . you drive different .
you see that thing . you do .
you do and not anaesthetized , separated from life .
there 's a hole at the front , and there 's a reason for that .
it 's a city car . you drive along . you get out .
you drive on to a proboscis . you get out . it lifts you up .
it presents the solar panel to the sun , and at night it 's a street lamp .
that 's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first , and then do the car second . these bubbles -- i can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages , floating around on the ground driven by ai .
when i showed this in south africa , everybody after was going , " yeah , hey , car on a stick . like this . "
can you imagine ? a car on a stick .
if you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally natural to me .
and that 's what i do with my furniture .
i 'm not putting charles eames ' furniture in buildings anymore .
forget that . we move on .
i 'm trying to build furniture that fits architecture .
i 'm trying to build transportation systems .
i work on aircraft for airbus , the whole thing -- i do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural , inspired - by - nature dreams home . i 'm going to finish on two things .
this is the steriolithography of a staircase .
it 's a little bit of a dedication to james , james watson .
i built this thing for my studio .
it cost me 250,000 dollars to build this .
most people go and buy the aston martin . i built this .
this is the data that goes with that . incredibly complex .
took about two years , because i 'm looking for fat - free design .
lean , efficient things . healthy products .
this is built by composites . it 's a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element , and this is a carbon - fiber handrail which is only supported in two places .
modern materials allow us to do modern things .
this is a shot in the studio .
this is how it looks pretty much every day .
you would n't want to have a fear of heights coming down it .
there is virtually no handrail . it does n't pass any standards .
who cares ?
yeah , and it has an internal handrail which gives it it 's strength . it 's this holistic integration .
that 's my studio . it 's subterranean .
it 's in notting hill next to all the crap -- you know , the prostitutes and all that stuff .
it 's next to david hockney 's original studio .
it has a lighting system that changes throughout the day .
my guys go out for lunch . the door 's open . they come back in , because it 's normally raining , and they prefer to stay in .
this is my studio . elephant skull from oxford university , 1988 .
i bought that last year . they 're very difficult to find .
i would -- if anybody 's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me , i 'll put it in the studio .
so i 'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you 'll see in the video .
it 's a homemade video , made it myself at three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is . you never see that .
you never see architects or designers showing you their real world .
this is called a " plasnet . " it 's a bio - polycarbonate new chair i 'm doing in italy .
world 's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars .
we should all be riding one of these .
as china buys all these crappy cars , we should be riding things like this . counterbalance .
like i say , it 's a cross between natural history museum and a nasa laboratory . it 's full of prototypes and objects .
it 's self - inspirational again . i mean , the rare times when i 'm there , i do enjoy it . and i get lots of kids coming -- lots and lots of kids coming .
i 'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers -- wankers .
this -- sorry -- -- that 's a solar seed . it 's a concept for new architecture .
that thing on the top is the world 's first solar - powered garden lamp -- the first produced . giles revell should be talking here today -- amazing photography of things you ca n't see .
the first sculptural model i made for that thing in tokyo .
lots of stuff . there 's a little leaf chair -- that golden looking thing is called " leaf . " it 's made from kevlar .
on the wall is my book called " supernatural , " which allows me to remember what i 've done , because i forget .
there 's an aerated brick i did in limoges last year , in concepts for new ceramics in architecture . [ unclear ] , working at three o'clock in the morning -- and i do n't pay overtime .
overtime is the passion of design , so join the club or do n't .
no , it 's true . it 's true . people like tom and greg -- we 're traveling like you ca n't -- we fit it all in . i do n't know how we do it .
next week i 'm at electrolux in sweden , then i 'm in beijing on friday . you work that one out .
and when i see ed 's photographs i think , why the hell am i going to china ? it 's true .
it 's true . because there 's a soul in this whole thing .
we need to have a new instinct for the 21st century .
we need to combine all this stuff .
if all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together , it would be a joy , absolute joy .
so there 's a new x - light system i 'm doing in japan .
there 's tuareg shoes from north africa . there 's a kifwebe mask .
these are my sculptures .
a copper jelly mold .
it sounds like some quiz show or something , does n't it ?
so , it 's going to end .
thank you , james , for your great inspiration .
thank you very much .
