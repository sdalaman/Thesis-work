a fact came out of mit , couple of years ago . ken hale ,
who 's a linguist , said that of the 6,000 languages spoken on earth right now , 3,000 are n't spoken by the children .
so that in one generation , we 're going to halve our cultural diversity .
he went on to say that every two weeks , an elder goes to the grave carrying the last spoken word of that culture .
so an entire philosophy , a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries , goes away .
and this happens every two weeks .
so for the last 20 years , since my dental experience , i have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people .
what i 'd like to do right now is share some of those stories with you .
this is tamdin .
she is a 69 - year - old nun .
she was thrown in prison in tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country .
and when i met her , she had just taken a walk over the himalayas from lhasa , the capital of tibet , into nepal , across to india -- 30 days -- to meet her leader , the dalai lama .
the dalai lama lives in dharamsala , india .
so i took this picture three days after she arrived , and she had this beat - up pair of tennis shoes on , with her toes sticking out .
and she crossed in march , and there 's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in march .
this is paldin .
paldin is a 62 - year - old monk .
and he spent 33 years in prison .
his whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising , when the dalai lama had to leave tibet .
and he was beaten , starved , tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison .
and when i met him , he was a kind gentle old man .
and it really impressed me -- i met him two weeks after he got out of prison -- that he went through that experience , and ended up with the demeanor that he had .
so i was in dharamsala meeting these people , and i 'd spent about five weeks there , and i was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of tibet into dharamsala .
and it just so happened , on the fifth week , there was a public teaching by the dalai lama .
and i was watching this crowd of monks and nuns , many of which i had just interviewed , and heard their stories , and i watched their faces , and they gave us a little fm radio , and we could listen to the translation of his teachings .
and what he said was : treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels , because it 's your enemies that build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment . that hit me so hard , telling these people that had been through this experience .
so , two months later , i went into tibet , and i started interviewing the people there , taking my photographs . that 's what i do .
i interview and do portraits .
and this is a little girl .
i took her portrait up on top of the jokhang temple .
and i 'd snuck in -- because it 's totally illegal to have a picture of the dalai lama in tibet -- it 's the quickest way you can get arrested .
so i snuck in a bunch of little wallet - sized pictures of the dalai lama , and i would hand them out .
and when i gave them to the people , they 'd either hold them to their heart , or they 'd hold them up to their head and just stay there .
and this is -- well , at the time -- i did this 10 years ago -- that was 36 years after the dalai lama had left .
so i was going in , interviewing these people and doing their portraits .
this is jigme and her sister , sonam .
and they live up on the chang tang , the tibetan plateau , way in the western part of the country .
this is at 17,000 feet .
and they had just come down from the high pastures , at 18,000 feet .
same thing : gave her a picture , she held it up to her forehead .
and i usually hand out polaroids when i do these , because i 'm setting up lights , and checking my lights , and when i showed her her polaroid , she screamed and ran into her tent .
this is tenzin gyatso ; he was found to be the buddha of compassion at the age of two , out in a peasant 's house , way out in the middle of nowhere .
at the age of four , he was installed as the 14th dalai lama .
as a teenager , he faced the invasion of his country , and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country .
eight years later , when they discovered there was a plot to kill him , they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback , and took the same trip that tamdin did .
and he 's never been back to his country since .
and if you think about this man , 46 years later , still sticking to this non - violent response to a severe political and human rights issue .
and the young people , young tibetans , are starting to say , listen , this does n't work . you know , violence as a political tool is all the rage right now .
and he still is holding this line .
so this is our icon to non - violence in our world -- one of our living icons .
this is another leader of his people .
this is moi . this is in the ecuadorian amazon .
and moi is 35 years old .
and this area of the ecuadorian amazon -- oil was discovered in 1972 .
as much oil , or twice as much oil as was spilled in the exxon valdez accident , was spilled in this little area of the amazon , and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move .
and moi belongs to the huaorani tribe , and they 're known as very fierce , they 're known as " auca . "
and they 've managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil workers with spears and blowguns .
and we spent -- i was with a team -- two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt .
this was on a monkey hunt , hunting with curare - tipped darts .
and the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible .
they could hear things , smell things , see things i could n't see .
and i could n't even see the monkeys that they were getting with these darts .
this is yadira ,
and yadira is five years old . she 's in a tribe that 's neighboring the huaorani .
and her tribe has had to move three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills .
and we never hear about that . and the latest infraction against these people is , as part of plan colombia , we 're spraying paraquat or round up , whatever it is -- we 're defoliating thousands of acres of the ecuadorian amazon in our war on drugs .
and these people are the people who take the brunt of it .
this is mengatoue .
he 's the shaman of the huaorani , and he said to us , you know , i 'm an older man now ; i 'm getting tired , you know ; i 'm tired of spearing these oil workers . i wish they would just go away . and i was -- i usually travel alone when i do my work , but i did this -- i hosted a program for discovery , and when i went down with the team , i was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people , especially into the huaorani , deep into the huaorani tribe .
and as it turned out , these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in with the locals .
one of the things i did just before 9/11 -- august of 2001 -- i took my son , dax , who was 16 at the time , and i took him to pakistan .
because at first i wanted -- you know , i 've taken him on a couple of trips , but i wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less .
i wanted him to get an experience in the islamic world and i also wanted him to -- i was going there to work with a group , do a story on a group called the kalash ,
that are a group of animists , 3,000 animists , that live -- very small area -- surrounded by islam -- there 's 3,000 of these kalash left ; they 're incredible people .
so it was a great experience for him . he stayed up all night with them , drumming and dancing .
and he brought a soccer ball , and we had soccer every night in this little village .
and then we went up and met their shaman .
by the way , mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well .
and this is john doolikahn , who 's the shaman of the kalash .
and he 's up in the mountains , right on the border with afghanistan .
in fact , on that other side is the area , tora bora , the area where osama bin laden 's supposed to be . this is the tribal area .
and we watched and stayed with john doolikahn .
and the shaman -- i did a whole series on shamanism , which is an interesting phenomenon .
but around the world , they go into trance in different ways ,
and in pakistan , the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves and they sacrifice an animal , pour the blood of the animal on the leaves and then inhale the smoke .
and they 're all praying to the mountain gods as they go into trance .
you know , getting kids used to different realities ,
i think , is so important . what dan dennett said the other day -- having a curriculum where they study different religions , just to make a mental flexibility , give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems --
i think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place .
and all the security issues they cause us .
so , one thing we did five years ago : we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the united states .
so we first hooked up a spot in the navajo nation with a classroom in seattle .
we now have 15 sites .
we have one in kathmandu , nepal ; dharamsala , india ; takaungu , kenya -- takaungu is one - third christian , one - third muslim and one - third animist , the community is --
ollantaytambo , peru , and arctic village , alaska .
this is daniel ; he 's one of our students in arctic village , alaska .
he lives in this log cabin --
no running water , no heat other than -- no windows and high - speed internet connection .
and this is -- i see this rolling out all over -- this is our site in ollantaytambo , peru , four years ago , where they first saw their first computers ; now they have computers in their classrooms .
and the way we 've done this -- we teach digital storytelling to these kids .
and we have them tell stories about issues in their community in their community that they care about .
and this is in peru , where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up .
and the way we do it is , we do it in workshops , and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling , and have them work with the kids .
and just this last year we 've taken a group of teenagers in , and this has worked the best .
so our dream is to bring teenagers together , so they 'll have a community service experience as well as a cross - cultural experience , as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure .
this is teaching photoshop in the tibetan children 's village in dharamsala .
we have the website , where the kids all get their homepage .
this is all their movies . we 've got about 60 movies that these kids have made , and they 're quite incredible .
the one i want to show you -- after we get them to make the movies , we have a night where we show the movies to the community .
and this is in takaungu -- we 've got a generator and a digital projector , and we 're projecting it up against a barn , and showing one of the movies that they made .
and if you get a chance , you can go to our website , and you 'll see the incredible work these kids do .
the other thing : i wanted to give indigenous people a voice .
that was one of the big motivating factors .
but the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country .
national geographic just did a roper study of 18 to 26 year olds in our country and in nine other industrialized countries .
it was a two million dollar study .
united states came in second to last in geographic knowledge .
70 percent of the kids could n't find afghanistan or iraq on a map ; 60 percent could n't find india ; 30 percent could n't find the pacific ocean .
and this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago .
so what i 'd like to show you now , in the couple of minutes i have left , is a film that a student made in guatemala .
we just had a workshop in guatemala .
a week before we got to the workshop , a massive landslide , caused by hurricane stan , last october , came in and buried 600 people alive in their village .
and this kid lived in the village -- he was n't there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that .
and he had n't seen a computer before we did this movie . we taught him photoshop and -- yeah , we can play it .
this is an old mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather .
thank you very much .
