i was sitting with my girls , and joy said , " dang , i wish he 'd get off my back .
my daddy , he calls me all the time . " " lucky for you he calls at all , " said jasmine . " i have n't heard from my dad in years . " at this moment , i knew the girls needed a way to connect with their fathers .
at camp diva , my non - profit organization , we have these types of conversations all the time as a way to help girls of african descent prepare for their passage into womanhood .
these girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms .
so i asked the girls , " how can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers ? " " let 's have a dance , " one girl shouted , and all the girls quickly backed her up .
they started dreaming about the decorations , invitations , the dresses they were going to wear , and what their fathers could and could not wear .
it was off and running before i could even blink my eyes , but even if i could have slowed down those girls , i would n't have , because one thing that i have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need .
the wisdom lives inside of them .
as long as they have infrastructure , mentorship and resources , they can build what they need , not only to survive , but to thrive .
so we had a dance , and girls and their fathers came in multitudes .
they were dressed to the nines .
they acted sweet .
they acted silly .
they really enjoyed each other 's company .
it was a huge success .
and the girls decided to make it an annual event .
so as the seasons changed , and it was time to plan the dance again , one girl named brianna spoke up , and she said , " my dad ca n't come to the dance , and this whole thing is making me sad . " " why not ? " the girls asked .
" because he 's in jail , " she bravely admitted .
" well , can he just get out for a day ? " one of the girls asked .
" and come in shackles ?
that 's worse than not having him here at all . " at this moment , i saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes .
so i asked , " what do you think we should do about this ?
we want every girl to experience the dance , right ? " so the girls thought for a moment , and one girl suggested , " why do n't we just take the dance in the jail ? " most of the girls doubted the possibility of that , and said , " are you crazy ?
who is going to allow a bunch of little girls , dressed up -- " " -- to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in spongebob suits ? " because that 's what they called them .
i said , " girls , well , well , you never know unless you ask . " so a letter was written to the richmond city sheriff , signed collectively by each girl , and i would have to say , he is a very special sheriff .
he contacted me immediately and said , whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside , his doors are always open .
because one thing he did know , that when fathers are connected to their children , it is less likely that they will return .
so , 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited .
the girls were dressed in their sunday best , and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties .
they hugged .
they shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish .
they laughed together .
it was beautiful .
the fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection , something that a lot of them did n't even have for a while .
fathers were in a space where they were able to make their daughters play , and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance .
even the guards cried .
but after the dance , we all realized that dad still would be in jail .
so we needed to create something that they could take with them .
so we brought in flip cams , and we had them look at the flip cams and just interview each other -- their messages , their thoughts .
this was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected , they could reconnect through this image .
i 'll never forget that one girl looked in her father 's eyes with that camera and said , " daddy , when you look at me , what do you see ? " because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve , and how they see us for the rest of our lives .
i know that very well , because i was one of the lucky girls .
i have had my father in my life always .
he 's even here today .
and that is why it is extremely special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers , especially those who are separated because of barbed wires and metal doors .
we have just created a form for girls who have heavy questions on their heart to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions and given the fathers the freedom to answer .
because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought : what type of woman am i preparing to put in the world ?
because a father is locked in does not mean he should be locked out of his daughter 's life .
