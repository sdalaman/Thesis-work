when i was considering a career in the art world , i took a course in london , and one of my supervisors was this irascible italian called pietro , who drank too much , smoked too much and swore much too much .
but he was a passionate teacher , and i remember one of our earlier classes with him , he was projecting images on the wall , asking us to think about them , and he put up an image of a painting .
it was a landscape with figures , semi - dressed , drinking wine . there was a nude woman in the lower foreground , and on the hillside in the back , there was a figure of the mythological god bacchus ,
and he said , " what is this ? " and i -- no one else did , so i put up my hand , and i said , " it 's a bacchanal by titian . "
he said , " it 's a what ? " i thought maybe i 'd pronounced it wrong .
" it 's a bacchanal by titian . "
he said , " it 's a what ? " i said , " it 's a bacchanal by titian . "
he said , " you boneless bookworm !
it 's a fucking orgy ! " as i said , he swore too much .
there was an important lesson for me in that .
pietro was suspicious of formal art training , art history training , because he feared that it filled people up with jargon , and then they just classified things rather than looking at them , and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary , and he wanted us to use our eyes , and he was especially evangelical about this message , because he was losing his sight .
he wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects .
what is it ? how is it made ? why was it made ?
how is it used ?
and these were important lessons to me when i subsequently became a professional art historian .
my kind of eureka moment came a few years later , when i was studying the art of the courts of northern europe , and of course it was very much discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day .
but as i began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions , i found there was a kind of a missing component , for everywhere i came across descriptions of tapestries .
tapestries were ubiquitous between the middle ages and , really , well into the 18th century , and it was pretty apparent why .
tapestries were portable . you could roll them up , send them ahead of you , and in the time it took to hang them up , you could transform a cold , dank interior into a richly colored setting .
tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated , or even themselves , and in addition to that , tapestries were hugely expensive .
they required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials -- the wools , the silks , even gold and silver thread .
so , all in all , in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare , tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda .
well , i became a tapestry historian .
in due course , i ended up as a curator at the metropolitan museum , because i saw the met as one of the few places where i could organize really big exhibitions about the subject i cared so passionately about .
and in about 1997 , the then - director philippe de montebello gave me the go - ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 . we normally have these very long lead - in times .
it was n't straightforward . it 's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car .
they have to be wound on huge rollers , shipped in oversized freighters .
some of them are so big we had , to get them into the museum , we had to take them up the great steps at the front .
we thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience : the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded ; the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread ; the labeling .
you know , we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs , a one - hit image . these were big , complex things , almost like cartoons with multiple narratives .
we had to draw our audience in , get them to slow down , to explore the objects .
there was a lot of skepticism . on the opening night , i overheard one of the senior members of staff saying , " this is going to be a bomb . " but in reality , in the course of the coming weeks and months , hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show .
the exhibition was designed to be an experience , and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs .
so i want you to use your imaginations , thinking of these wall - high objects , some of them 10 meters wide , depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today , thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer , violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism .
i remember taking my son 's school class . he was eight at the time , and all the little boys , they kind of -- you know , they were little boys , and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground -- -- kind of an in - your - face joke by the artist .
and you can just imagine them .
but it brought it alive to them . i think they suddenly saw that these were n't just old faded tapestries .
these were images of the world in the past , and that it was the same for our audience .
and for me as a curator , i felt proud . i felt i 'd shifted the needle a little .
through this experience that could only be created in a museum , i 'd opened up the eyes of my audience -- historians , artists , press , the general public -- to the beauty of this lost medium .
a few years later , i was invited to be the director of the museum , and after i got over that -- " who , me ? the tapestry geek ? i do n't wear a tie ! " -- i realized the fact : i believe passionately in that curated museum experience .
we live in an age of ubiquitous information , and sort of " just add water " expertise , but there 's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well - told narrative , what the curator does , the interpretation of a complex , esoteric subject , in a way that retains the integrity of the subject , that makes it -- unpacks it for a general audience .
and that , to me , today , is now the challenge and the fun of my job , supporting the vision of my curators , whether it 's an exhibition of samurai swords , early byzantine artifacts , renaissance portraits , or the show we heard mentioned earlier , the mcqueen show , with which we enjoyed so much success last summer .
that was an interesting case .
in the late spring , early summer of 2010 , shortly after mcqueen 's suicide , our curator of costume , andrew bolton , came to see me , and said , " i 've been thinking of doing a show on mcqueen , and now is the moment . we have to , we have to do it fast . " it was n't easy . mcqueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy , but andrew went to london and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence , and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows , which were works of performance art in their own right , and we proceeded to do something at the museum , i think , we 've never done before .
it was n't just your standard installation .
in fact , we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings , a recreation of his first studio , a hall of mirrors , a curiosity box , a sunken ship , a burned - out interior , with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating .
and in this extraordinary setting , the costumes were like actors and actresses , or living sculptures .
it could have been a train wreck .
it could have looked like shop windows on fifth avenue at christmas , but because of the way that andrew connected with the mcqueen team , he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of mcqueen , and the show was quite transcendant , and it became a phenomenon in its own right .
by the end of the show , we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show , but no one really complained .
i heard over and over again , " wow , that was worth it .
it was a such a visceral , emotive experience . " now , i 've described two very immersive exhibitions , but i also believe that collections , individual objects , can also have that same power .
the met was set up not as a museum of american art , but of an encyclopedic museum , and today , 140 years later , that vision is as prescient as ever , because , of course , we live in a world of crisis , of challenge , and we 're exposed to it through the 24/7 newsreels .
it 's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations , the cultures , that we 're seeing the current manifestation of .
whether it 's libya , egypt , syria , it 's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding .
i mean , our new islamic galleries are a case in point , opened 10 years , almost to the week , after 9/11 .
i think for most americans , knowledge of the islamic world was pretty slight before 9/11 , and then it was thrust upon us in one of america 's darkest hours , and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event .
now , in our galleries , we show 14 centuries of the development of different islamic cultures across a vast geographic spread , and , again , hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last october .
i 'm often asked , " is digital media replacing the museum ? " and i think those numbers are a resounding rejection
i 'm a huge advocate of the web .
it gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe , but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship .
bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time , across space , whose lives may have been very different to our own , but who , like us , had hopes and dreams , frustrations and achievements in their lives . and i think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves , helps us make better decisions about where we 're going .
the great hall at the met is one of the great portals of the world , awe - inspiring , like a medieval cathedral .
from there , you can walk in any direction to almost any culture .
i frequently go out into the hall and the galleries and i watch our visitors coming in .
some of them are comfortable . they feel at home .
they know what they 're looking for .
others are very uneasy . it 's an intimidating place .
they feel that the institution is elitist .
i 'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism .
i want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind , where they 're prepared to be a little bit lost , to explore , to see the unfamiliar in the familiar , or to try the unknown .
because for us , it 's all about bringing them face to face with great works of art , capturing them at that moment of discomfort , when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iphone , your blackberry , but to create a zone where their curiosity can expand .
and whether it 's in the expression of a greek sculpture that reminds you of a friend , or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry , or , to bring it back to my tutor pietro , those dancing figures who are indeed knocking back the wine , and that nude figure in the left foreground .
wow . she is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality .
in that moment , our scholarship can tell you that this is a bacchanal , but if we 're doing our job right , and you 've checked the jargon at the front door , trust your instinct .
you know it 's an orgy .
thank you .
