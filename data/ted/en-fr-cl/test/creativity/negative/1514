i want to start on a slightly somber note .
two thousand and seven , five years ago , my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer , stage iib .
now , looking back , the most harrowing part of that experience was not just the hospital visits -- these were very painful for my wife , understandably so .
it was not even the initial shock of knowing that she had breast cancer , just 39 years old , absolutely no history of cancer in her family .
the most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience was we were making decisions after decisions after decisions that were being thrust upon us .
should it be a mastectomy ? should it be a lumpectomy ?
should it be a more aggressive form of treatment , given that it was stage iib ?
with all the side effects ?
or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment ?
and these were being pressed upon us by the doctors .
now , you could ask this question , why were the doctors doing this ?
now , a simplistic answer would be , the doctors are doing this because they want to protect themselves legally .
i think that is too simplistic .
these are well - meaning doctors , some of them have gone on to become very good friends .
they probably were simply following the wisdom that has come down the ages , this adage that when you 're making decisions , especially decisions of importance , it 's best to be in charge , it 's best to be in control , it 's best to be in the driver 's seat .
and we were certainly in the driver 's seat , making all these decisions , and let me tell you , if some of you had been there , it was a most agonizing and harrowing experience .
which got me thinking .
i said , is there any validity to this whole adage that when you 're making decisions , it 's best to take the driver 's seat , be in charge , be in control ?
or are there contexts where we 're far better off taking the passenger 's seat and have someone else drive ?
for example , a trusted financial advisor , could be a trusted doctor , etc.
and since i study human decision making , i said , i 'm going to run some studies to find some answers .
and i 'm going to share one of these studies with you today .
so , imagine that all of you are participants in the study .
i want to tell you that what you 're going to do in the study is you 're going to drink a cup of tea .
if you 're wondering why , i 'll tell you why in a few seconds from now .
you are going to solve a series of puzzles , and i 'm going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily .
and the more puzzles you solve , the greater the chances that you 'll win some prizes .
now , why do you have to consume the tea ?
why ? because it makes a lot of sense .
in order to solve these puzzles effectively , if you think about it , your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously .
right ? it needs to be alert , for which caffeine is very good .
simultaneously , it needs to be calm .
not agitated , calm . for which chamomile is very good .
now comes the between - subjects design , the ab design , the ab testing .
so what i 'm going to do is randomly assign you to one of two groups .
so imagine that there is an imaginary line out here , so everyone here will be group a , everyone out here will be group b.
now , for you folks , what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to show you these two teas , and i 'm asking you , i 'll go ahead and ask you , to choose your tea . so you can choose which of the two tea you want .
you can decide , what is your mental state : okay , i 'm going to choose the caffeinated tea , i 'm going to choose the chamomile tea .
so you 're going to be in charge , you 're going to be in control , you 're going to be in the driver 's seat .
you folks , i 'm going to show you these two teas , but you do n't have a choice .
i 'm going to give you one of these two teas , and keep in mind , i 'm going to pick one of these two teas at random for you .
and you know that .
so if you think about it , this is an extreme case scenario , because in the real world , whenever you are taking passenger 's seat , very often the driver is going to be someone you trust , an expert , etc. so this is an extreme case scenario .
now , you 're all going to consume the tea .
so imagine that you are taking the tea now , we 'll wait for you to finish the tea .
we 'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects .
now you 're going to have 30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles .
here 's an example of the puzzle you 're going to solve .
anyone in the audience want to take a stab ?
baba shiv : whoa !
okay , that 's cool .
yeah , so what we do if we had you , who will get the answer , as a participant , we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise .
because we want these puzzles to be difficult .
these are tricky puzzles because your first instinct is to say " tulip , " and then you have to unstick yourself .
right ? so these have been calibrated to your level of expertise .
because we want this to be difficult , and i 'll tell you why momentarily .
now , here 's another example .
anyone ? it 's much more difficult .
bs : yeah , wow . okay .
so , yeah , so this is again difficult .
you will say " kambar , " then you will have to go , " maker , " and all that , and then you can unstick yourself .
okay , so you have 30 minutes now to solve these 15 puzzles .
now , the question we 're asking here is in terms of the outcome , in terms of the number of puzzles solved , will you in the driver 's seat end up solving more puzzles , because you are in control , you could decide which tea you will choose , or would you be better off , in terms of the number of puzzles solved ?
and systemically what we will show , across a series of studies , is that you , the passengers , even though the tea was picked for you at random , will end up solving more puzzles than you , the drivers .
we also observe another thing , and that is , you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles , you 're also putting less juice into the task .
less effort , you 're less persistent , and so on .
how do you know that ?
well we have two objective measures .
one is , what is the time , on average , you 're taking in attempting to solve these puzzles ?
you will spend less time compared to you .
second , you have 30 minutes to solve these , are you taking the entire 30 minutes , or are you giving up before the 30 minutes elapse ?
you will be more likely to give up before the 30 minutes elapse compared to you .
so , you 're putting in less juice , and therefore the outcome : fewer puzzles solved .
now , that brings us now to , why does this happen ?
and under what situations , when would we see this pattern of results where the passenger is going to show better , more favorable outcomes compared to the driver ?
it all has to do with when you face what i call the inca .
it 's an acronym that stands for the nature of the feedback you 're getting after you 've made the decision .
so , if you think about it , in this particular puzzle task , it could happen in investing in the stock market , very volatile out there , it could be the medical situation -- the feedback here is immediate .
you know the feedback , whether you 're solving the puzzles or not .
right ? second , it is negative .
remember , the deck was stacked against you .
in terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles .
and this can happen in the medical domain .
for example , very early on in the treatment , things are negative , the feedback , before things become positive .
right ? it can happen in the stock market .
volatile stock market , getting negative feedback that 's also immediate .
and the feedback in all these cases is concrete .
it 's not ambiguous ; you know if you 've solved the puzzles or not .
now , the added one , apart from this immediacy , negative , this concreteness , now you have a sense of agency .
you were responsible for your decision .
so what do you do ?
you focus on the foregone option .
you say , you know what ? i should have chosen the other tea .
that casts your decision in doubt , reduces the confidence you have in the decision , reduces the confidence you have in the performance , the performance in terms of solving the puzzles .
and therefore less juice into the task , fewer puzzles solved , a less favorable outcome compared to you folks .
and this can happen in the medical domain , if you think about it .
right ? a patient in the driver 's seat , for example .
less juice , which means keeping herself or himself less physically fit , physically active to hasten the recovery process , which is what is often advocated . you probably would n't do that .
and therefore , there are times when you 're facing the inca , when the feedback is going to be immediate , negative , concrete , and you have the sense of agency , where you 're far better off taking the passenger 's seat and have someone else drive .
now , i started off on the somber note .
i want to finish up on a more upbeat note .
it has now been five years , slightly more than five years , and the good news , thank god , is that the cancer is still in remission .
so it all ends well , but one thing i did n't mention was that very early on into her treatment , my wife and i decided that we will take the passenger 's seat .
and that made so much of a difference in terms of the peace of mind that came with that , we could focus on her recovery .
we let the doctors make all the decisions , take the driver 's seat .
thank you .
