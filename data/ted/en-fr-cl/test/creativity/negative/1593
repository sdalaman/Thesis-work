i 'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are , how globalized we are n't , and why it 's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments .
and the leading point of view on this , whether measured by number of books sold , mentions in media , or surveys that i 've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the world trade organization , is this view that national borders really do n't matter very much anymore , cross - border integration is close to complete , and we live in one world .
and what 's interesting about this view is , again , it 's a view that 's held by pro - globalizers like tom friedman , from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted , but it 's also held by anti - globalizers , who see this giant globalization tsunami that 's about to wreck all our lives if it has n't already done so .
the other thing i would add is that this is not a new view .
i 'm a little bit of an amateur historian , so i 've spent some time going back , trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing . and the best , earliest quote that i could find was one from david livingstone , writing in the 1850s about how the railroad , the steam ship , and the telegraph were integrating east africa perfectly with the rest of the world .
now clearly , david livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time , but it does seem useful to ask ourselves , " just how global are we ? " before we think about where we go from here .
so the best way i 've found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat , may not even be close to flat , is with some data .
so one of the things i 've been doing over the last few years is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders , and i 've looked at the cross - border component as a percentage of the total .
i 'm not going to present all the data that i have here today , but let me just give you a few data points .
i 'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow , one kind of flow of people , one kind of flow of capital , and , of course , trade in products and services .
so let 's start off with plain old telephone service .
of all the voice - calling minutes in the world last year , what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross - border phone calls ?
pick a percentage in your own mind .
the answer turns out to be two percent .
if you include internet telephony , you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent , but it 's nowhere near what people tend to estimate .
or let 's turn to people moving across borders .
one particular thing we might look at , in terms of long - term flows of people , is what percentage of the world 's population is accounted for by first - generation immigrants ?
again , please pick a percentage .
turns out to be a little bit higher .
it 's actually about three percent .
or think of investment . take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010 .
what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment ?
not quite ten percent .
and then finally , the one statistic that i suspect many of the people in this room have seen : the export - to - gdp ratio .
if you look at the official statistics , they typically indicate a little bit above 30 percent .
however , there 's a big problem with the official statistics , in that if , for instance , a japanese component supplier ships something to china to be put into an ipod , and then the ipod gets shipped to the u.s. , that component ends up getting counted multiple times .
so nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is , so i thought i would ask the person who 's spearheading the effort to generate data on this , pascal lamy , the director of the world trade organization ,
what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of gdp , without the double - and triple - counting ,
and it 's actually probably a bit under 20 percent , rather than the 30 percent - plus numbers that we 're talking about .
so it 's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book , " world 3.0 , " that we 're very , very far from the no - border effect benchmark , which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85 , 90 , 95 percent .
so clearly , apocalyptically - minded authors have overstated the case .
but it 's not just the apocalyptics , as i think of them , who are prone to this kind of overstatement .
i 've also spent some time surveying audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guess these numbers to be .
let me share with you the results of a survey that harvard business review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people 's guesses along these dimensions actually were .
so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide .
first of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
okay .
second , these are pretty large errors . for four quantities whose average value is less than 10 percent , you have people guessing three , four times that level .
even though i 'm an economist , i find that a pretty large error .
and third , this is not just confined to the readers of the harvard business review .
i 've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world , and in all cases except one , where a group actually underestimated the trade - to - gdp ratio , people have this tendency towards overestimation , and so i thought it important to give a name to this , and that 's what i refer to as globaloney , the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars .
especially because , i suspect , some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims , i think it 's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney .
a couple of different reasons come to mind .
first of all , there 's a real dearth of data in the debate .
let me give you an example . when i first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy , one of the people who wrote in , not entirely in agreement , was tom friedman . and since my article was titled " why the world is n't flat , " that was n't too surprising .
what was very surprising to me was tom 's critique , which was , " ghemawat 's data are narrow . "
and this caused me to scratch my head , because as i went back through his several - hundred - page book , i could n't find a single figure , chart , table , reference or footnote .
so my point is , i have n't presented a lot of data here to convince you that i 'm right , but i would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of these hand - me - down insights that we 've been bombarded with actually are correct .
so dearth of data in the debate is one reason .
a second reason has to do with peer pressure .
i remember , i decided to write my " why the world is n't flat " article , because i was being interviewed on tv in mumbai , and the interviewer 's first question to me was , " professor ghemawat , why do you still believe that the world is round ? " and i started laughing , because i had n't come across that formulation before .
and as i was laughing , i was thinking , i really need a more coherent response , especially on national tv . i 'd better write something about this .
but what i ca n't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question .
the perspective was , here is this poor professor .
he 's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
he really has no idea as to what 's actually going on in the world .
so try this out with your friends and acquaintances ,
if you like . you 'll find that it 's very cool to talk about the world being one , etc.
if you raise questions about that formulation , you really are considered a bit of an antique .
and then the final reason , which i mention , especially to a ted audience , with some trepidation , has to do with what i call " techno - trances . "
if you listen to techno music for long periods of time , it does things to your brainwave activity .
something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers , all political barriers , all geographic barriers , because at this point i know you are n't allowed to ask me questions , but when i get to this point in my lecture with my students , hands go up , and people ask me , " yeah , but what about facebook ? "
and i got this question often enough that i thought i 'd better do some research on facebook .
because , in some sense , it 's the ideal kind of technology to think about . theoretically , it makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door .
what percentage of people 's friends on facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we 're analyzing are based ?
the answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15 percent .
non - negligible , so we do n't live in an entirely local or national world , but very , very far from the 95 percent level that you would expect , and the reason 's very simple .
we do n't , or i hope we do n't , form friendships at random on facebook . the technology is overlaid on a pre - existing matrix of relationships that we have , and those relationships are what the technology does n't quite displace . those relationships are why we get far fewer than 95 percent of our friends being located in countries other than where we are .
so does all this matter ? or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization - related issues ?
i want to suggest that actually , globaloney can be very harmful to your health .
first of all , recognizing that the glass is only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration , whereas if we thought we were already there , there would be no particular point to pushing harder .
it 's a little bit like , we would n't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference .
so being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more , something that would contribute further to global welfare .
which brings me to my second point .
avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization .
so i actually spend most of my " world 3.0 " book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate .
i 'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today , so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what i have in mind .
think of france and the current debate about immigration .
when you ask people in france what percentage of the french population is immigrants , the answer is about 24 percent . that 's their guess .
maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue .
or to take an even more striking example , when the chicago council on foreign relations did a survey of americans , asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid , the guess was 30 percent , which is slightly in excess of the actual level -- -- of u.s. governmental commitments to federal aid .
the reassuring thing about this particular survey was , when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data , some of them -- not all of them -- seemed to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid .
so foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here , because if you think about it , what i 've been talking about today is this notion -- very uncontroversial amongst economists -- that most things are very home - biased .
" foreign aid is the most aid to poor people , " is about the most home - biased thing you can find .
if you look at the oecd countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person , and compare it with how much they spend per poor person in poor countries , the ratio -- branko milanovic at the world bank did the calculations -- turns out to be about 30,000 to one .
now of course , some of us , if we truly are cosmopolitan , would like to see that ratio being brought down to one - is - to - one .
i 'd like to make the suggestion that we do n't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are .
if we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one , we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the rio summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on .
so in summary , while radical openness is great , given how closed we are , even incremental openness could make things
dramatically better . thank you very much .
