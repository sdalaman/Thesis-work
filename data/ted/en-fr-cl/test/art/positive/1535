we 're going to begin in 1964 .
bob dylan is 23 years old , and his career is just reaching its pinnacle .
he 's been christened the voice of a generation , and he 's churning out classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate , but there 's a small minority of dissenters , and they claim that bob dylan is stealing other people 's songs .
2004 . brian burton , aka danger mouse , takes the beatles ' " white album , " combines it with jay - z 's " the black album " to create " the grey album . " " the grey album " becomes an immediate sensation online , and the beatles ' record company sends out countless cease - and - desist letters for " unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property . " now , " the grey album " is a remix .
it is new media created from old media .
it was made using these three techniques : copy , transform and combine .
it 's how you remix . you take existing songs , you chop them up , you transform the pieces , you combine them back together again , and you 've got a new song , but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs .
but i think these are n't just the components of remixing .
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity .
i think everything is a remix , and i think this is a better way to conceive of creativity .
all right , let 's head back to 1964 , and let 's hear where some of dylan 's early songs came from .
we 'll do some side - by - side comparisons here .
all right , this first song you 're going to hear is " nottamun town . " it 's a traditional folk tune .
after that , you 'll hear dylan 's " masters of war . "
jean ritchie : ♫ in nottamun town , not a soul would look out , ♫ ♫ not a soul would look up , not a soul would look down . ♫ bob dylan : ♫ come you masters of war , ♫ ♫ you that build the big guns , you that build the death planes , ♫ ♫ you that build all the bombs . ♫ kirby ferguson : okay , so that 's the same basic melody and overall structure . this next one is " the patriot game , " by dominic behan . alongside that , you 're going to hear " with god on our side , " by dylan .
dominic behan : ♫ come all ye young rebels , ♫ ♫ and list while i sing , ♫ ♫ for the love of one 's land is a terrible thing . ♫ bd : ♫ oh my name it is nothin ' , ♫ ♫ my age it means less , ♫ ♫ the country i come from is called the midwest . ♫ kf : okay , so in this case , dylan admits he must have heard " the patriot game , " he forgot about it , then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain , he just thought it was his song .
last one , this is " who 's going to buy you ribbons , " another traditional folk tune .
alongside that is " do n't think twice , it 's all right . "
this one 's more about the lyric .
paul clayton : ♫ it ai n't no use to sit and sigh now , ♫ ♫ darlin ' , and it ai n't no use to sit and cry now . ♫ bd : ♫ it ai n't no use to sit and wonder why , babe , ♫ ♫ if you do n't know by now , ♫ ♫ and it ai n't no use to sit and wonder why , babe , ♫ ♫ it 'll never do somehow . ♫ kf : okay , now , there 's a lot of these .
it 's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies dylan used in his early songs were borrowed .
this is pretty typical among folk singers .
here 's the advice of dylan 's idol , woody guthrie .
" the worlds are the important thing .
do n't worry about tunes . take a tune , sing high when they sing low , sing fast when they sing slow , and you 've got a new tune . "
and that 's , that 's what guthrie did right here , and i 'm sure you all recognize the results .
we know this tune , right ? we know it ?
actually you do n't .
that is " when the world 's on fire , " a very old melody , in this case performed by the carter family .
guthrie adapted it into " this land is your land . "
so , bob dylan , like all folk singers , he copied melodies , he transformed them , he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff .
now , american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others .
instead , these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property .
now , creative works may indeed be kind of like property ,
but it 's property that we 're all building on , and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared .
henry ford once said , " i invented nothing new .
i simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work .
progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable . "
2007 . the iphone makes it debut .
apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early , but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades .
that 's multi - touch , controlling a device by touching its display .
here is steve jobs introducing multi - touch and making a rather foreboding joke .
steve jobs : and we have invented a new technology called multi - touch .
you can do multi - fingered gestures on it , and boy have we patented it .
kf : yes . and yet , here is multi - touch in action . this is at ted , actually , about a year earlier .
this is jeff han , and , i mean , that 's multi - touch .
it 's the same animal , at least .
let 's hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology .
jeff han : multi - touch sensing is n't anything -- is n't completely new . i mean , people like bill buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s .
the technology , you know , is n't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility .
kf : so he 's pretty frank about it not being new .
so it 's not multi - touch as a whole that 's patented .
it 's the small parts of it that are , and it 's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent : to promote the progress of useful arts .
here is the first ever slide - to - unlock .
that is all there is to it . apple has patented this .
it 's a 28 - page software patent , but i will summarize what it covers . spoiler alert : unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger .
i 'm only exaggerating a little bit . it 's a broad patent .
now , can someone own this idea ?
now , back in the '80s , there were no software patents , and it was xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface .
what if they had patented pop - up menus , scrollbars , the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets of paper ?
would a young and inexperienced apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like xerox ?
now , this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you 're the one getting remixed .
for example ...
sj : i mean , picasso had a saying .
he said , " good artists copy . great artists steal . " and we have , you know , always been shameless about stealing great ideas .
kf : okay , so that 's in '96 . here 's in 2010 .
" i 'm going to destroy android because it 's a stolen product . " " i 'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this . " okay , so in other words , great artists steal , but not from me .
now , behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion
we have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours .
we have no such aversion towards copying what other people have , because we do that nonstop .
so here 's the sort of equation we 're looking at .
we 've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property , plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases , plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court , plus cognitive biases against perceived loss .
and the sum looks like this .
that is the last four years of lawsuits in the realm of smartphones .
is this promoting the progress of useful arts ?
1983 . bob dylan is 42 years old , and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past .
he records a song called " blind willie mctell , " named after the blues singer , and the song is a voyage through the past , through a much darker time , but a simpler one , a time when musicians like willie mctell had few illusions about what they did .
" i jump ' em from other writers but i arrange ' em my own way . " i think this is mostly what we do .
our creativity comes from without , not from within .
we are not self - made . we are dependent on one another , and admitting this to ourselves is n't an embrace of mediocrity and derivativeness .
it 's a liberation from our misconceptions , and it 's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin .
thank you so much . it was an honor to be here .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you .
