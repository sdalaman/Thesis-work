so , why does good sex so often fade , even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever ?
and why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex , contrary to popular belief ?
or , the next question would be , can we want what we already have ?
that 's the million - dollar question , right ?
and why is the forbidden so erotic ?
what is it about transgression that makes desire so potent ?
and why does sex make babies , and babies spell erotic disaster in couples ?
it 's kind of the fatal erotic blow , is n't it ?
and when you love , how does it feel ?
and when you desire , how is it different ?
these are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love .
so i travel the globe , and what i 'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered , there seems to be a crisis of desire .
a crisis of desire , as in owning the wanting -- desire as an expression of our individuality , of our free choice , of our preferences , of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies .
you know , this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term , not because we want 14 children , for which we need to have even more because many of them wo n't make it , and not because it is exclusively a woman 's marital duty .
this is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire .
so what sustains desire , and why is it so difficult ?
and at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship , i think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs .
on the one hand , our need for security , for predictability , for safety , for dependability , for reliability , for permanence -- all these anchoring , grounding experiences of our lives that we call home .
but we also have an equally strong need -- men and women -- for adventure , for novelty , for mystery , for risk , for danger , for the unknown , for the unexpected , surprise -- you get the gist -- for journey , for travel .
so reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship , or what we today like to call a passionate marriage , used to be a contradiction in terms .
marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship .
but now we want our partner to still give us all these things , but in addition i want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot , and we live twice as long .
so we come to one person , and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide : give me belonging , give me identity , give me continuity , but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one .
give me comfort , give me edge .
give me novelty , give me familiarity .
give me predictability , give me surprise .
and we think it 's a given , and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that .
so now we get to the existential reality of the story , right ?
because i think , in some way -- and i 'll come back to that -- but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination .
so why does good sex so often fade ?
what is the relationship between love and desire ?
how do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
because therein lies the mystery of eroticism .
so if there is a verb , for me , that comes with love , it 's " to have . "
and if there is a verb that comes with desire , it is " to want . "
in love , we want to have , we want to know the beloved .
we want to minimize the distance . we want to contract that gap .
we want to neutralize the tensions . we want closeness .
but in desire , we tend to not really want to go back to the places we 've already gone .
forgone conclusion does not keep our interest .
in desire , we want an other , somebody on the other side that we can go visit , that we can go spend some time with , that we can go see what goes on in their red light district .
in desire , we want a bridge to cross .
or in other words , i sometimes say , fire needs air .
desire needs space .
and when it 's said like that , it 's often quite abstract .
but then i took a question with me .
and i 've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with " mating in captivity , " and i asked people , when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner ?
not attracted sexually , per se , but most drawn .
and across culture , across religion , and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back .
so the first group is : i am most drawn to my partner when she is away , when we are apart , when we reunite .
basically , when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner , when my imagination comes back in the picture , and when i can root it in absence and in longing , which is a major component of desire .
but then the second group is even more interesting : i am most drawn to my partner when i see him in the studio , when she is onstage , when he is in his element , when she 's doing something she 's passionate about , when i see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him , when i see her hold court .
basically , when i look at my partner radiant and confident , probably the biggest turn - on across the board .
radiant , as in self - sustaining .
i look at this person -- by the way , in desire people rarely talk about it , when we are blended into one , five centimeters from each other . i do n't know in inches how much that is .
but it 's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them .
it 's when i 'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance , where this person that is already so familiar , so known , is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious , somewhat elusive .
and in this space between me and the other lies the erotic Ã©lan , lies that movement toward the other .
because sometimes , as proust says , mystery is not about traveling to new places , but it 's about looking with new eyes .
and so , when i see my partner on his own or her own , doing something in which they are enveloped , i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception , and i stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me .
and then , more importantly , in this description about the other or myself -- it 's the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire .
nobody needs anybody .
there is no caretaking in desire .
caretaking is mightily loving . it 's a powerful anti - aphrodisiac .
i have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them .
wanting them is one thing . needing them is a shutdown , and women have known that forever , because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge .
for good reasons , right ?
and then the third group of answers usually would be when i 'm surprised , when we laugh together , as somebody said to me in the office today , when he 's in his tux , so i said , you know , it 's either the tux or the cowboy boots .
but basically it 's when there is novelty .
but novelty is n't about new positions . it is n't a repertoire of techniques .
novelty is , what parts of you do you bring out ?
what parts of you are just being seen ?
because in some way one could say sex is n't something you do , eh ?
sex is a place you go . it 's a space you enter inside yourself and with another , or others .
so where do you go in sex ?
what parts of you do you connect to ?
what do you seek to express there ?
is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union ?
is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive ?
is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything ?
is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes ?
what comes out there ? it 's a language .
it is n't just a behavior .
and it 's the poetic of that language that i 'm interested in , which is why i began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence .
you know , animals have sex .
it 's the pivot , it 's biology , it 's the natural instinct .
we are the only ones who have an erotic life , which means that it 's sexuality transformed by the human imagination .
we are the only ones who can make love for hours , have a blissful time , multiple orgasms , and touch nobody , just because we can imagine it .
we can hint at it . we do n't even have to do it .
we can experience that powerful thing called anticipation , which is a mortar to desire , the ability to imagine it , as if it 's happening , to experience it as if it 's happening , while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time .
so when i began to think about eroticism , i began to think about the poetics of sex , and if i look at it as an intelligence , then it 's something that you cultivate .
what are the ingredients ? imagination , playfulness , novelty , curiosity , mystery .
but the central agent is really that piece called the imagination .
but more importantly , for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark , what sustains desire , i had to go back to the original definition of eroticism , the mystical definition , and i went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma , which is the other side , and i looked at it looking at the community that i had grown up in , which was a community in belgium , all holocaust survivors , and in my community there were two groups : those who did n't die , and those who came back to life .
and those who did n't die lived often very tethered to the ground , could not experience pleasure , could not trust , because when you 're vigilant , worried , anxious , and insecure , you ca n't lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative .
those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death .
they knew how to keep themselves alive .
and when i began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that i work with , i sometimes would hear people say , " i want more sex , " but generally people want better sex , and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness , of vibrancy , of renewal , of vitality , of eros , of energy that sex used to afford them , or that they 've hoped it would afford them .
and so i began to ask a different question .
" i shut myself off when . . . " began to be the question .
" i turn off my desires when . . . " which is not the same question as , " what turns me of is . . . " and " you turn me off when . . . " and people began to say , " i turn myself off when i feel dead inside , when i do n't like my body , when i feel old , when i have n't had time for myself , when i have n't had a chance to even check in with you , when i do n't perform well at work , when i feel low self esteem , when i do n't have a sense of self - worth , when i do n't feel like i have a right to want , to take , to receive pleasure . " and then i began to ask the reverse question .
" i turn myself on when . . . " because most of the time , people like to ask the question , " you turn me on , what turns me on , " and i 'm out of the question . you know ?
now , if you are dead inside , the other person can do a lot of things for valentine 's .
it wo n't make a dent . there is nobody at the reception desk .
so i turn myself on when , i turn my desires , i wake up when ...
now , in this paradox between love and desire , what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love -- mutuality , reciprocity , protection , worry , responsibility for the other -- are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire .
because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love : jealousy , possessiveness , aggression , power , dominance , naughtiness , mischief .
basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day .
you know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct .
if everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses , we would n't be having such interesting talks about this .
but no , in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we do n't always know how to bring to the person that we love , because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word : the ability to stay connected to one 's self in the presence of another .
so i want to draw that little image for you , because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs , we are born with that . our need for connection , our need for separateness , or our need for security and adventure , or our need for togetherness and for autonomy , and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable , and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore .
that 's the beginning of desire , that exploratory needs curiosity , discovery .
and then at some point they turn around and they look at you , and if you tell them , " hey kiddo , the world 's a great place . go for it .
there 's so much fun out there , " then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time .
they can go off in their imagination , off in their body , off in their playfulness , all the while knowing that there 's somebody when they come back .
but if on this side there is somebody who says , " i 'm worried . i 'm anxious . i 'm depressed .
my partner has n't taken care of me in so long .
what 's so good out there ? do n't we have everything you need together , you and i ? " then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize .
some of us will come back , came back a long time ago , and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other .
i will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection .
and i will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection , and i wo n't know how to leave you in order to go play , in order to go experience pleasure , in order to discover , to enter inside myself .
translate this into adult language .
it starts very young . it continues into our sex lives up to the end .
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time .
" are you going to be there ?
are you going to curse me ? are you going to scold me ?
are you going to be angry with me ? " and they may be gone , but they 're never really away , and those are often the people that will tell you , in the beginning it was super hot .
because in the beginning , the growing intimacy was n't yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire .
the more connected i became , the more responsible i felt , the less i was able to let go in your presence .
the third child does n't really come back .
so what happens , if you want to sustain desire , it 's that real dialectic piece .
on the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go .
on the other hand if you ca n't go , you ca n't have pleasure , you ca n't culminate , you do n't have an orgasm , you do n't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own .
so in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs , there are a few things that i 've come to understand erotic couples do .
one , they have a lot of sexual privacy .
they understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them .
they also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing .
foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm .
they also understand that an erotic space is n't about , you begin to stroke the other .
it 's about you create a space where you leave management inc. , maybe where you leave the agile program , and you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible .
responsibility and desire just butt heads .
they do n't really do well together .
erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes .
it 's pretty much like the moon . it has intermittent eclipses .
but what they know is they know how to resurrect it .
they know how to bring it back , and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it 's just going to fall from heaven while you 're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long - term relationship already has .
committed sex is premeditated sex .
it 's willful . it 's intentional .
it 's focus and presence .
merry valentine 's .
