so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	story	of	a	place	that	i	now	call	home	.
it	's	a	story	of	public	education	and	of	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	of	what	design	might	do	to	improve	both	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	,	north	carolina	,	usa	.
to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	``	where	:	``	so	here	's	north	carolina	,	and	if	we	zoom	in	,	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	is	in	the	eastern	part	of	the	state	.
it	's	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	east	 driv 	 ing 	 	-	time	from	raleigh	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	flat	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 swamp 	 y 	 	.
it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 farm 	 land 	 	.
the	entire	 count 	 y 	 	is	home	to	just	20,000	people	,	and	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 parse 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	.
so	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	27	people	per	square	mile	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	about	10	people	per	square	kilometer	.
bertie	 count 	 y 	 	is	kind	of	a	prime	 ex 	 ample 	 	in	the	 de 	 mise 	 	of	 r 	 ural 	 	america	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	all	over	the	country	and	even	in	 place 	 s 	 	beyond	the	american	 border 	 s 	 	.
we	know	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	 hollow 	 ing 	 	out	of	small	 town 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 down 	 town 	 s 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	ghost	 town 	 s 	 	.
the	brain	drain	--	where	all	of	the	most	educated	and	 qual 	 ified 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	and	never	come	back	.
it	's	the	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	farm	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	and	under	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	 school 	 s 	 	and	 high 	 er 	 	poverty	rates	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	than	in	urban	.
and	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	is	no	exception	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	thing	it	 struggle 	 s 	 	with	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	similar	to	it	,	is	that	there	's	no	 share 	 d 	 	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	the	future	of	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	6.8	percent	of	all	our	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	giving	in	the	u.s.	right	now	 benefit 	 s 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	and	yet	20	percent	of	our	population	 live 	 s 	 	there	.
so	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	;	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	poor	.
it	is	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 y 	 	in	the	state	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	one	in	three	of	 it 	 s 	 	children	living	in	poverty	,	and	it	's	what	is	 refer 	 red 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	a	``	 r 	 ural 	 	ghetto	.	``
the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 most 	 ly 	 	 agricultur 	 al 	 	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	are	cotton	and	tobacco	,	and	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	our	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	peanut	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	 employ 	 er 	 	is	the	purdue	chicken	 process 	 ing 	 	plant	.
the	 count 	 y 	 	seat	is	windsor	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	like	 time 	 s 	 	square	of	windsor	that	you	're	looking	at	right	now	.
it	's	home	to	 on 	 ly 	 	2,000	people	,	and	like	a	lot	of	other	small	 town 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hollow 	 ed 	 	out	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
there	are	more	 building 	 s 	 	that	are	empty	or	in	 dis 	 repair 	 	than	occupied	and	in	use	.
you	can	count	the	number	of	 restaurant 	 s 	 	in	the	 count 	 y 	 	on	one	hand	--	bunn	's	barbecue	 be 	 ing 	 	my	absolute	 favor 	 ite 	 	.
but	in	the	whole	 count 	 y 	 	there	is	no	coffee	shop	,	there	's	no	 inter 	 net 	 	cafe	,	there	's	no	movie	theater	,	there	's	no	 book 	 store 	 	.
there	is	n't	even	a	walmart	.
racially	,	the	 count 	 y 	 	is	about	60	percent	african	american	,	but	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	public	 school 	 s 	 	is	most	of	the	 privilege 	 d 	 	white	 kid 	 s 	 	go	to	the	private	lawrence	academy	.
so	the	public	school	 student 	 s 	 	are	about	86	percent	african	american	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	spread	from	the	local	 news 	 paper 	 	of	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 gradu 	 ating 	 	class	,	and	you	can	see	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 star 	 k 	 	.
so	to	say	that	the	public	education	system	in	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	is	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	would	be	a	huge	 under 	 state 	 ment 	 	.
there	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	no	pool	of	 qual 	 ified 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	pull	from	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	eight	percent	of	the	people	in	the	 count 	 y 	 	have	a	bachelor	's	degree	or	 high 	 er 	 	.
so	there	is	n't	a	big	 leg 	 acy 	 	in	the	 pri 	 de 	 	of	education	.
in	fact	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 on 	 ly 	 	27	percent	of	all	the	third	-	through	eighth	-	graders	 we 	 re 	 	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	state	standard	in	both	english	and	math	.
so	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	i	'm	 paint 	 ing 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 b 	 leak 	 	picture	of	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	but	i	promise	there	is	good	news	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	asset	,	in	my	opinion	,	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 asset 	 s 	 	in	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	right	now	is	 th 	 is 	 	man	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	dr.	chip	zullinger	,	 fond 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	dr.	z	.
he	was	 br 	 ought 	 	in	in	october	2007	 a 	 s 	 	the	new	 super 	 intend 	 ent 	 	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	fix	 th 	 is 	 	broken	school	system	.
and	he	 previous 	 ly 	 	was	a	 super 	 intend 	 ent 	 	in	charleston	,	south	carolina	and	then	in	denver	,	colorado	.
he	 start 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	country	's	first	 chart 	 er 	 	 school 	 s 	 	in	the	late	'80s	in	the	u.s	.
and	he	is	an	absolute	renegade	and	a	 vision 	 ary 	 	,	and	he	is	the	reason	that	i	now	live	and	work	there	.
so	in	february	of	2009	,	dr.	zullinger	 invit 	 ed 	 	us	,	project	h	design	--	which	is	a	non	-	profit	design	firm	that	i	 found 	 ed 	 	--	to	come	to	bertie	and	to	partner	with	him	on	the	repair	of	 th 	 is 	 	school	 di 	 strict 	 	and	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	design	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	to	the	repair	of	the	school	 di 	 strict 	 	.
and	he	 invit 	 ed 	 	us	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	type	of	design	process	--	one	that	 result 	 s 	 	in	appropriate	design	 solution 	 s 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	have	access	to	design	 service 	 s 	 	or	creative	capital	.
 specific 	 ally 	 	,	we	use	these	six	design	 direct 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	number	two	:	we	design	with	,	not	for	--	in	that	,	when	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 human 	 itarian 	 	-	focused	design	,	it	's	not	about	 design 	 ing 	 	for	 client 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
it	's	about	 design 	 ing 	 	with	people	,	and	 lett 	 ing 	 	appropriate	 solution 	 s 	 	emerge	from	 with 	 in 	 	.
so	at	the	time	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	down	there	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	based	in	san	francisco	,	and	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	back	and	forth	for	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	rest	of	2009	,	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	about	half	our	time	in	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	.
and	when	i	say	we	,	i	mean	project	h	,	but	more	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	i	mean	 my 	 self 	 	and	my	partner	,	matthew	miller	,	who	's	an	architect	and	a	sort	of	macgyver	-	type	 build 	 er 	 	.
so	fast	-	forward	to	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	we	now	live	there	.
i	have	 strat 	 egic 	 ally 	 	cut	matt	's	head	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	photo	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	would	kill	me	if	he	 k 	 new 	 	i	was	using	it	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 sweat 	 suit 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	front	porch	.	we	live	there	.
we	now	call	 th 	 is 	 	place	home	.
over	the	course	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	that	we	 s 	 pent 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	back	and	forth	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	we	had	 fall 	 en 	 	in	love	with	the	place	.
we	had	 fall 	 en 	 	in	love	with	the	place	and	the	people	and	the	work	that	we	're	able	to	do	in	a	 r 	 ural 	 	place	like	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	,	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	and	 build 	 ers 	 	,	you	ca	n't	do	 every 	 where 	 	.
there	's	space	to	experiment	and	to	weld	and	to	test	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	have	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 advoc 	 ate 	 	in	dr.	zullinger	.
there	's	a	 no 	 b 	 ility 	 	of	real	,	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	,	dirt	-	under	-	your	-	 finger 	 nail 	 s 	 	work	.
but	beyond	our	personal	 reason 	 s 	 	for	 want 	 ing 	 	to	be	there	,	there	is	a	huge	need	.
there	is	a	total	vacuum	of	creative	capital	in	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	.
there	is	n't	a	single	 licens 	 ed 	 	architect	in	the	whole	 count 	 y 	 	.
and	so	we	saw	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	design	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 touch 	 ed 	 	tool	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	did	n't	 other 	 wise 	 	have	,	and	to	be	sort	of	the	--	to	 us 	 her 	 	that	in	 a 	 s 	 	a	new	type	of	tool	in	 the 	 ir 	 	tool	kit	.
the	 initi 	 al 	 	goal	 be 	 came 	 	using	design	 with 	 in 	 	the	public	education	system	in	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	dr.	zullinger	--	that	was	why	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	.
but	beyond	that	,	we	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	,	was	in	 di 	 re 	 	need	of	a	fresh	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	 pri 	 de 	 	and	 connect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	and	of	the	creative	capital	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	much	 lack 	 ing 	 	.
so	the	goal	 be 	 came 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	to	 app 	 ly 	 	design	 with 	 in 	 	education	,	but	then	to	figure	out	how	to	make	education	a	great	vehicle	for	community	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
so	in	order	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	've	taken	three	different	 approach 	 es 	 	to	the	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	design	and	education	.
and	i	should	say	that	these	are	three	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	,	but	i	feel	 pre 	 tty 	 	confident	that	they	could	work	in	a	lot	of	other	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	around	the	u.s.	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	beyond	.
so	the	first	of	the	three	is	design	for	education	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	kind	of	direct	,	obvious	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	the	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	physical	construction	of	 improv 	 ed 	 	 space 	 s 	 	and	 material 	 s 	 	and	 experience 	 s 	 	for	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 student 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	the	awful	mobile	 trail 	 ers 	 	and	the	 out 	 d 	 ated 	 	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	and	the	 terr 	 ible 	 	 material 	 s 	 	that	we	're	building	 school 	 s 	 	out	of	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	out	for	us	in	a	couple	different	ways	.
the	first	was	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 ren 	 ov 	 ations 	 	of	computer	 lab 	 s 	 	.
so	 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	the	computer	 lab 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	an	under	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	school	like	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	,	where	they	have	to	 bench 	 mark 	 	test	every	other	week	,	the	computer	lab	is	a	kill	-	and	-	drill	 test 	 ing 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
you	come	in	,	you	face	the	wall	,	you	take	your	test	and	you	 leav 	 e 	 	.
so	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	change	the	way	that	 student 	 s 	 	approach	technology	,	to	create	a	more	 con 	 vivi 	 al 	 	and	social	space	that	was	more	 engag 	 ing 	 	,	more	 access 	 ible 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	ability	for	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	use	these	 space 	 s 	 	for	technology	-	based	 instruct 	 ion 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	lab	at	the	high	school	,	and	the	principal	there	is	in	love	with	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
every	time	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 visit 	 ors 	 	,	it	's	the	first	place	that	he	 take 	 s 	 	them	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	the	co	-	creation	with	some	 teacher 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 education 	 al 	 	 play 	 ground 	 	system	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	 element 	 ary 	 	-	level	 student 	 s 	 	to	learn	core	 subject 	 s 	 	through	game	play	and	activity	and	running	around	and	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	a	kid	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	game	that	the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 play 	 ing 	 	here	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	they	 we 	 re 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 multi 	 plic 	 ation 	 	through	a	game	 call 	 ed 	 	match	me	.
and	in	match	me	,	you	take	the	class	,	divide	it	 in 	 to 	 	two	 team 	 s 	 	,	one	team	on	each	side	of	the	 play 	 ground 	 	,	and	the	teacher	will	take	a	piece	of	chalk	and	just	write	a	number	on	each	of	the	 tire 	 s 	 	.
and	then	she	'll	call	out	a	math	problem	--	so	let	's	say	four	 time 	 s 	 	four	--	and	then	one	student	from	each	team	 ha 	 s 	 	to	compete	to	figure	out	that	four	 time 	 s 	 	four	is	16	and	find	the	tire	with	the	16	on	it	and	 s 	 it 	 	on	it	.
so	the	goal	is	to	have	all	of	your	 team 	 mate 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	 tire 	 s 	 	and	then	your	team	 win 	 s 	 	.
and	the	impact	of	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	surprising	and	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
some	of	the	 class 	 es 	 	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	have	 report 	 ed 	 	 high 	 er 	 	test	 score 	 s 	 	,	a	 great 	 er 	 	comfort	level	with	the	material	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	the	 boy 	 s 	 	,	that	in	going	 out 	 side 	 	and	 play 	 ing 	 	,	they	are	n't	 af 	 raid 	 	to	take	on	a	double	-	digit	 multi 	 plic 	 ation 	 	problem	--	and	 al 	 so 	 	that	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	able	to	use	these	 a 	 s 	 	 assess 	 ment 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	to	better	gauge	how	 the 	 ir 	 	 student 	 s 	 	are	 understand 	 ing 	 	new	material	.
so	with	design	for	education	,	i	think	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	to	have	a	 share 	 d 	 	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	the	 solution 	 s 	 	with	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	so	that	they	have	the	incentive	and	the	 desir 	 e 	 	to	use	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	mr.	perry	.	he	's	the	 assist 	 ant 	 	 super 	 intend 	 ent 	 	.
he	came	out	for	one	of	our	teacher	-	training	 day 	 s 	 	and	won	like	five	 round 	 s 	 	of	match	me	in	a	row	and	was	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	 him 	 self 	 	.
so	the	second	approach	is	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	education	 it 	 self 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	complex	.
it	's	a	 system 	 s 	 	-	level	look	at	how	education	is	 administer 	 ed 	 	and	what	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	and	to	whom	.
so	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	so	much	about	making	change	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	creating	the	 condition 	 s 	 	under	which	change	is	possible	and	the	incentive	to	want	to	make	change	,	which	is	 eas 	 ier 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	than	 d 	 one 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	in	 in 	 side 	 	-	the	-	box	education	 system 	 s 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
so	for	us	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	graphic	public	campaign	 call 	 ed 	 	connect	bertie	.
there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	blue	 dot 	 s 	 	all	over	the	 count 	 y 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	for	a	fund	that	the	school	 di 	 strict 	 	had	to	put	a	 desk 	 top 	 	computer	and	a	 broad 	 band 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	in	every	home	with	a	child	in	the	public	school	system	.
right	now	i	should	say	,	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	10	percent	of	the	 house 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	an	in	-	home	 inter 	 net 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 place 	 s 	 	to	get	wifi	are	in	the	school	 building 	 s 	 	,	or	at	the	bojangles	fried	chicken	joint	,	which	i	find	 my 	 self 	 	 squat 	 ting 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	a	lot	.
 a 	 side 	 	from	,	you	know	,	 get 	 ting 	 	people	 excit 	 ed 	 	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	what	the	heck	these	blue	 dot 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	over	the	place	,	it	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	school	system	to	envision	how	it	might	 be 	 come 	 	a	catalyst	for	a	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	community	.
it	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	reach	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	school	 wall 	 s 	 	and	to	think	about	how	they	could	play	a	role	in	the	community	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
so	the	first	batch	of	 computer 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 install 	 ed 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	summer	,	and	we	're	 help 	 ing 	 	dr.	zullinger	develop	some	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	around	how	we	might	connect	the	 class 	 room 	 	and	the	home	to	extend	 learn 	 ing 	 	beyond	the	school	day	.
and	then	the	third	approach	,	which	is	what	i	'm	most	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	,	which	is	where	we	are	now	,	is	:	design	 a 	 s 	 	education	.
so	``	design	 a 	 s 	 	education	``	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	teach	design	 with 	 in 	 	public	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	not	design	-	based	 learn 	 ing 	 	--	not	like	``	let	's	learn	physics	by	building	a	rocket	,	``	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	design	-	 think 	 ing 	 	 couple 	 d 	 	with	real	construction	and	 fabric 	 ation 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	put	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	local	community	purpose	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 design 	 ers 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 consult 	 ants 	 	,	but	we	're	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	and	we	are	charged	with	growing	creative	capital	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	generation	.
and	what	design	 off 	 ers 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 education 	 al 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	is	an	antidote	to	all	of	the	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	rigid	,	verbal	 instruct 	 ion 	 	that	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	school	 di 	 strict 	 s 	 	are	 plague 	 d 	 	by	.
it	's	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	,	it	's	in	-	your	-	face	,	it	 requir 	 es 	 	an	active	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	and	it	 allow 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	 app 	 ly 	 	all	the	core	subject	 learn 	 ing 	 	in	real	ways	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	shop	class	and	how	shop	class	--	wood	and	metal	shop	class	in	 part 	 icular 	 	--	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 intend 	 ed 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	n't	going	to	go	to	college	.
it	's	a	 voc 	 ation 	 al 	 	training	path	.
it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	-	class	;	it	's	blue	-	collar	.
the	 project 	 s 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	let	's	make	a	 bird 	 house 	 	for	your	mom	for	christmas	.
and	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	shop	class	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	away	 entire 	 ly 	 	.
so	we	thought	,	what	if	you	could	 br 	 ing 	 	back	shop	class	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	time	orient	the	 project 	 s 	 	around	 thing 	 s 	 	that	the	community	 need 	 ed 	 	,	and	to	 in 	 fuse 	 	shop	class	with	a	more	critical	and	creative	-	design	-	 think 	 ing 	 	studio	process	.
so	we	took	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 nebul 	 ous 	 	idea	and	have	 work 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	with	dr.	zullinger	for	the	past	year	on	writing	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	one	-	year	curriculum	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	at	the	high	school	level	to	the	 juni 	 or 	 	class	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 s 	 	in	four	 week 	 s 	 	,	at	the	end	of	the	summer	,	and	my	partner	and	i	,	matthew	and	i	,	just	went	through	the	 ard 	 uous 	 	and	 total 	 ly 	 	 con 	 volu 	 ted 	 	process	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 cert 	 ified 	 	 a 	 s 	 	high	school	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	run	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
so	over	the	course	of	two	 semester 	 s 	 	,	the	fall	and	the	spring	,	the	 student 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	three	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	every	single	day	in	our	4,500	square	foot	studio	/	shop	space	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	from	going	out	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 e 	 th 	 no 	 graphic 	 	research	and	 do 	 ing 	 	the	need	-	 find 	 ing 	 	,	coming	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	studio	,	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 brain 	 storm 	 ing 	 	and	design	 visual 	 ization 	 	to	come	up	with	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	that	might	work	,	and	then	moving	 in 	 to 	 	the	shop	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	them	,	building	them	,	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	them	,	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	if	they	are	going	to	work	and	 re 	 fin 	 ing 	 	that	.
and	then	over	the	summer	,	they	're	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	summer	job	.
they	're	paid	 a 	 s 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	of	project	h	to	be	the	construction	crew	with	us	to	build	these	 project 	 s 	 	in	the	community	.
so	the	first	project	,	which	will	be	built	next	summer	,	is	an	open	-	air	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	market	 down 	 town 	 	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	bus	 shelter 	 s 	 	for	the	school	bus	system	in	the	second	year	and	home	 improve 	 ments 	 	for	the	 elder 	 ly 	 	in	the	third	year	.
so	these	are	real	visible	 project 	 s 	 	that	 hope 	 fully 	 	the	 student 	 s 	 	can	point	to	and	say	,	``	i	built	that	,	and	i	'm	proud	of	it	.	``
so	i	want	you	to	meet	three	of	our	 student 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	ryan	.
she	is	15	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
she	 love 	 s 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	and	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	a	high	school	teacher	.
she	 want 	 s 	 	to	go	to	college	,	but	she	 want 	 s 	 	to	come	back	to	bertie	 count 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	her	family	is	from	,	where	she	 call 	 s 	 	home	,	and	she	 feel 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	about	giving	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	that	she	's	 be 	 en 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	fortunate	in	.
so	what	studio	h	might	 off 	 er 	 	her	is	a	way	to	develop	 skill 	 s 	 	so	that	she	might	give	back	in	the	most	 meaning 	 ful 	 	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	eric	.	he	 play 	 s 	 	for	the	 foot 	 ball 	 	team	.
he	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 dirt 	 bike 	 	 rac 	 ing 	 	,	and	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	an	architect	.
so	for	him	,	studio	h	 off 	 ers 	 	him	a	way	to	develop	the	 skill 	 s 	 	he	will	need	 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	,	 every 	 thing 	 	from	 draft 	 ing 	 	to	wood	and	metal	construction	to	how	to	do	research	for	a	client	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	anthony	.
he	is	16	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 love 	 s 	 	 hunt 	 ing 	 	and	 fish 	 ing 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	with	his	 hand 	 s 	 	,	and	so	for	him	,	studio	h	 mean 	 s 	 	that	he	can	stay	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	his	education	through	that	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
he	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 forest 	 ry 	 	,	but	he	is	n't	 s 	 ure 	 	,	so	if	he	 end 	 s 	 	up	not	going	to	college	,	he	will	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	some	industry	-	relevant	 skill 	 s 	 	.
what	design	and	building	 re 	 ally 	 	 off 	 ers 	 	to	public	education	is	a	different	kind	of	 class 	 room 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	building	 down 	 town 	 	,	which	may	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 be 	 come 	 	the	 s 	 ite 	 	of	our	future	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	market	,	is	now	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
and	going	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	community	and	 interview 	 ing 	 	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	about	what	kind	of	food	they	buy	and	from	where	and	why	--	that	's	a	 home 	 work 	 	 assign 	 ment 	 	.
and	the	ribbon	-	cutting	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	at	the	end	of	the	summer	when	they	have	built	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	market	and	it	's	open	to	the	public	--	that	's	the	final	 ex 	 am 	 	.
and	for	the	community	,	what	design	and	building	 off 	 ers 	 	is	real	,	visible	,	built	progress	.
it	's	one	project	per	year	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	the	youth	the	 big 	 gest 	 	asset	and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 un 	 ta 	 pped 	 	resource	in	 imagin 	 ing 	 	a	new	future	.
so	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	studio	h	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	first	year	,	is	a	small	story	--	13	 student 	 s 	 	,	it	's	two	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	it	's	one	project	in	one	place	.
but	we	feel	like	 th 	 is 	 	could	work	in	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 strong 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	power	of	the	small	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	so	difficult	to	do	 human 	 itarian 	 	work	at	a	global	scale	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	when	you	zoom	out	that	far	,	you	lose	the	ability	to	view	people	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	design	 it 	 self 	 	is	a	process	of	constant	education	for	the	people	that	we	work	with	and	for	and	for	us	 a 	 s 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	.
and	let	's	face	it	,	 design 	 ers 	 	,	we	need	to	 re 	 invent 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	need	to	re	-	 educ 	 ate 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	around	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	matter	,	we	need	to	work	 out 	 side 	 	of	our	comfort	 zone 	 s 	 	more	,	and	we	need	to	be	better	 citizen 	 s 	 	in	our	own	 back 	 yard 	 	.
so	while	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	story	,	we	hope	that	it	 represent 	 s 	 	a	step	in	the	right	direction	for	the	future	of	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	for	the	future	of	public	education	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	 al 	 so 	 	for	the	future	of	design	.
thank	you	.
