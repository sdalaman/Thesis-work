well	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	.
my	talk	 essential 	 ly 	 	got	written	by	three	historic	 event 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 day 	 s 	 	of	each	other	in	the	last	two	 month 	 s 	 	--	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 un 	 related 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	you	will	see	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	all	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	the	story	i	want	to	tell	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	first	one	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	funeral	--	to	be	more	precise	,	a	 re 	 burial 	 	.
on	may	22nd	,	there	was	a	hero	's	 re 	 burial 	 	in	frombork	,	poland	of	the	16th	-	century	astronomer	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	.
he	did	that	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	by	 re 	 placing 	 	the	earth	with	the	 s 	 un 	 	in	the	center	of	the	solar	system	,	and	then	with	 th 	 is 	 	simple	-	looking	act	,	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	a	scientific	and	 techno 	 logical 	 	revolution	,	which	 man 	 y 	 	call	the	copernican	revolution	.
now	that	was	,	 iron 	 ically 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 be 	 fitting 	 ly 	 	,	the	way	we	found	his	grave	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	was	the	custom	of	the	time	,	copernicus	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	buried	in	an	 un 	 mark 	 ed 	 	grave	,	together	with	14	 other 	 s 	 	in	that	 cat 	 hedral 	 	.
dna	analysis	,	one	of	the	 hall 	 mark 	 s 	 	of	the	scientific	revolution	of	the	last	400	 year 	 s 	 	that	he	 start 	 ed 	 	,	was	the	way	we	found	which	set	of	 bone 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 belong 	 ed 	 	to	the	person	who	read	all	 t 	 hose 	 	astronomical	 book 	 s 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 left 	 over 	 	hair	that	was	copernicus	'	hair	--	 obvious 	 ly 	 	not	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	read	these	 book 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	on	.
that	match	was	 un 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	.
the	dna	 match 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	nicolaus	copernicus	.
now	,	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	biology	and	dna	and	life	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 tan 	 tal 	 izing 	 	when	you	talk	about	copernicus	 be 	 cause 	 	,	even	back	then	,	his	 follow 	 ers 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	made	the	logical	step	to	ask	:	if	the	earth	is	just	a	planet	,	then	what	about	 planet 	 s 	 	around	other	 star 	 s 	 	?
what	about	the	idea	of	the	 plural 	 ity 	 	of	the	 world 	 s 	 	,	about	life	on	other	 planet 	 s 	 	?
in	fact	,	i	'm	 borrow 	 ing 	 	here	from	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	 book 	 s 	 	of	the	time	.
and	at	the	time	,	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	 answer 	 ed 	 	that	question	 positive 	 ly 	 	:	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
but	there	was	no	evidence	.
and	here	 begin 	 s 	 	400	 year 	 s 	 	of	 frust 	 ration 	 	,	of	 un 	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	--	the	 dream 	 s 	 	of	galileo	,	giordano	bruno	,	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	--	which	never	led	to	the	answer	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 question 	 s 	 	which	 human 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	all	the	time	.
``	what	is	life	?	what	is	the	origin	of	life	?
are	we	 al 	 one 	 	?	``
and	that	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	at	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	when	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 develop 	 ments 	 	due	to	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	code	of	life	,	dna	,	all	of	that	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	us	,	not	 close 	 r 	 	,	but	further	 a 	 part 	 	from	 answer 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	good	news	.
a	lot	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	let	's	start	with	the	 planet 	 s 	 	.
let	's	start	with	the	old	copernican	question	:	are	there	 earth 	 s 	 	around	other	 star 	 s 	 	?
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	heard	,	there	is	a	way	in	which	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	,	and	now	able	,	to	answer	that	question	.
it	's	a	new	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
our	team	,	 be 	 fitting 	 ly 	 	i	think	,	named	it	after	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 dream 	 ers 	 	of	the	copernican	time	,	and	that	 tele 	 scope 	 	's	sole	purpose	is	to	go	out	,	find	the	 planet 	 s 	 	that	orbit	other	 star 	 s 	 	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	,	and	tell	us	how	often	do	 planet 	 s 	 	like	our	own	earth	happen	to	be	out	there	.
the	 tele 	 scope 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	built	 similar 	 ly 	 	to	the	,	well	-	known	to	you	,	hubble	space	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	have	an	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	lens	--	a	wide	-	field	lens	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	call	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 photograph 	 er 	 	.
and	if	,	in	the	next	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	,	you	walk	out	in	the	early	 even 	 ing 	 	and	look	straight	up	and	place	you	palm	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	looking	at	the	field	of	the	sky	where	 th 	 is 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	is	 search 	 ing 	 	for	 planet 	 s 	 	day	and	night	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	 interrupt 	 ion 	 	,	for	the	next	four	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	way	we	do	that	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	with	a	method	,	which	we	call	the	transit	method	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	mini	-	eclipses	that	occur	when	a	planet	 pass 	 es 	 	in	front	of	 it 	 s 	 	star	.
not	all	of	the	 planet 	 s 	 	will	be	 fortuitous 	 ly 	 	oriented	for	us	to	be	able	do	that	,	but	if	you	have	a	million	 star 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	find	 en 	 ough 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	what	kepler	is	going	to	detect	is	just	the	 dimm 	 ing 	 	of	the	light	from	the	star	.
we	are	not	going	to	see	the	image	of	the	star	and	the	planet	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
all	the	 star 	 s 	 	for	kepler	are	just	 point 	 s 	 	of	light	.
but	we	learn	a	lot	from	that	:	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	there	is	a	planet	there	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	learn	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
how	much	of	the	light	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 dimm 	 ed 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	how	big	the	planet	is	.
we	learn	about	 it 	 s 	 	orbit	,	the	period	of	 it 	 s 	 	orbit	and	so	on	.
so	,	what	have	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	let	me	try	to	walk	you	through	what	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	and	so	you	understand	the	news	that	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
what	kepler	 do 	 es 	 	is	discover	a	lot	of	 candid 	 ates 	 	,	which	we	then	follow	up	and	find	 a 	 s 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	confirm	 a 	 s 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	.
it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	.
there	are	small	 planet 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 big 	 ger 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	there	are	big	 planet 	 s 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	we	count	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	and	they	have	different	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	.
we	do	that	in	our	solar	system	.
in	fact	,	even	back	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 ancient 	 s 	 	,	the	solar	system	in	that	sense	would	look	on	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	will	be	the	 small 	 er 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	and	there	will	be	the	big	 planet 	 s 	 	,	even	back	to	the	time	of	epicurus	and	then	of	course	copernicus	and	his	 follow 	 ers 	 	.
up	 un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	that	was	the	solar	system	--	four	earth	-	like	 planet 	 s 	 	with	small	 radi 	 us 	 	,	 small 	 er 	 	than	about	two	 time 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	earth	--	and	that	was	of	course	 merc 	 ury 	 	,	venus	,	mars	,	and	of	course	the	earth	,	and	then	the	two	big	,	giant	 planet 	 s 	 	.
then	the	copernican	revolution	 br 	 ought 	 	in	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	and	of	course	three	more	 planet 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
now	the	total	planet	number	in	our	solar	system	was	nine	.
the	small	 planet 	 s 	 	 dominate 	 d 	 	,	and	there	was	a	certain	 harmon 	 y 	 	to	that	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	copernicus	was	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	note	,	and	kepler	was	one	of	the	big	 proponent 	 s 	 	of	.
so	now	we	have	pluto	to	join	the	 number 	 s 	 	of	small	 planet 	 s 	 	.
but	up	 un 	 til 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	was	all	we	 k 	 new 	 	about	 planet 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	the	 frust 	 ration 	 	was	.
the	copernican	dream	was	 un 	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	technology	came	to	the	point	where	we	could	discover	a	planet	around	 an 	 other 	 	star	,	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	.
in	the	next	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	500	 planet 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	 orbit 	 ing 	 	other	 star 	 s 	 	,	with	different	 method 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	picture	.
there	was	of	course	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	for	it	:	we	 on 	 ly 	 	see	the	big	 planet 	 s 	 	,	so	that	's	why	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	in	the	 categor 	 y 	 	of	``	like	jupiter	.	``
but	you	see	,	we	have	n't	gone	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	still	back	where	copernicus	was	.
we	did	n't	have	any	evidence	 whet 	 her 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	like	the	earth	are	out	there	.
and	we	do	care	about	 planet 	 s 	 	like	the	earth	 be 	 cause 	 	by	now	we	 under 	 stood 	 	that	life	 a 	 s 	 	a	chemical	system	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 s 	 	a	 small 	 er 	 	planet	with	water	and	with	 rock 	 s 	 	and	with	a	lot	of	complex	 chemist 	 ry 	 	to	 origin 	 ate 	 	,	to	emerge	,	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
and	we	did	n't	have	the	evidence	for	that	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	here	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	give	you	a	first	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	what	the	new	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	kepler	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	tell	us	in	the	last	few	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	,	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	we	are	back	to	the	 harmon 	 y 	 	and	to	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	the	 dream 	 s 	 	of	copernicus	.
you	can	see	here	,	the	small	 planet 	 s 	 	dominate	the	picture	.
the	 planet 	 s 	 	which	are	 mark 	 ed 	 	``	like	earth	,	``	[	are	]	 definite 	 ly 	 	more	than	any	other	 planet 	 s 	 	that	we	see	.
and	now	for	the	first	time	,	we	can	say	that	.
there	is	a	lot	more	work	we	need	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
most	of	these	are	 candid 	 ates 	 	.
in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	we	will	confirm	them	.
but	the	 statistic 	 al 	 	result	is	loud	and	clear	.
and	the	 statistic 	 al 	 	result	is	that	 planet 	 s 	 	like	our	own	earth	are	out	there	.
our	own	 milk 	 y 	 	way	 galax 	 y 	 	is	rich	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 planet 	 s 	 	.
so	the	question	is	:	what	do	we	do	next	?
well	,	first	of	all	,	we	can	 stud 	 y 	 	them	now	that	we	know	where	they	are	.
and	we	can	find	 t 	 hose 	 	that	we	would	call	 habit 	 able 	 	,	meaning	that	they	have	similar	 condition 	 s 	 	to	the	 condition 	 s 	 	that	we	experience	here	on	earth	and	where	a	lot	of	complex	 chemist 	 ry 	 	can	happen	.
so	,	we	can	even	put	a	number	to	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	now	do	we	expect	our	own	 milk 	 y 	 	way	 galax 	 y 	 	 harbor 	 s 	 	.
and	the	number	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	might	expect	,	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 stagger 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	about	100	million	 s 	 uch 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	.
that	's	great	news	.	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	with	our	own	little	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	just	in	the	next	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	'll	be	able	to	identify	at	 l 	 east 	 	60	of	them	.
so	that	's	great	 be 	 cause 	 	then	we	can	go	and	 stud 	 y 	 	them	--	 remote 	 ly 	 	,	of	course	--	with	all	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	tested	in	the	past	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	can	find	what	they	're	made	of	,	would	 the 	 ir 	 	 atmosphere 	 s 	 	have	water	,	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	 m 	 ethane 	 	.
we	know	and	expect	that	we	'll	see	that	.
that	's	great	,	but	that	is	not	the	whole	news	.
that	's	not	why	i	'm	here	.
why	i	'm	here	is	to	tell	you	that	the	next	step	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	part	.
the	one	that	 th 	 is 	 	step	is	 enabl 	 ing 	 	us	to	do	is	coming	next	.
and	here	 come 	 s 	 	biology	--	biology	,	with	 it 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	question	,	which	still	 stand 	 s 	 	 un 	 answer 	 ed 	 	,	which	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	:	``	if	there	is	life	on	other	 planet 	 s 	 	,	do	we	expect	it	to	be	like	life	on	earth	?	``
and	let	me	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	tell	you	here	,	when	i	say	life	,	i	do	n't	mean	``	dolce	vita	,	``	good	life	,	human	life	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	mean	life	on	earth	,	past	and	present	,	from	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	to	us	 human 	 s 	 	,	in	 it 	 s 	 	rich	 mole 	 cular 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	the	way	we	now	understand	life	on	earth	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	set	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	--	and	we	call	that	,	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	 bio 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	life	 a 	 s 	 	a	chemical	process	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	chemical	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
so	the	question	is	:	is	that	chemical	 phenomen 	 on 	 	universal	,	or	is	it	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 depend 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	?
is	it	like	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	which	is	the	same	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	or	there	would	be	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	different	 bio 	 chemist 	 ries 	 	 where 	 ver 	 	we	find	them	?
we	need	to	know	what	we	are	looking	for	when	we	try	to	do	that	.
and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	question	,	which	we	do	n't	know	the	answer	to	,	but	which	we	can	try	--	and	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	--	to	answer	in	the	lab	.
we	do	n't	need	to	go	to	space	to	answer	that	question	.
and	so	,	that	's	what	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
and	that	's	what	 man 	 y 	 	people	now	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
and	a	lot	of	the	good	news	 come 	 s 	 	from	that	part	of	the	bridge	that	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	i	want	to	show	you	here	.
when	we	think	of	what	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	we	call	life	,	we	think	of	 compartment 	 al 	 ization 	 	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	which	are	 import 	 ant 	 	for	life	in	a	membrane	,	 isolate 	 d 	 	from	the	rest	of	the	environment	,	but	yet	,	in	an	environment	in	which	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	could	 origin 	 ate 	 	together	.
and	in	one	of	our	 lab 	 s 	 	,	jack	szostak	's	 lab 	 s 	 	,	it	was	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	that	 show 	 ed 	 	that	the	 environment 	 s 	 	--	which	are	 ver 	 y 	 	common	on	 planet 	 s 	 	,	on	certain	 type 	 s 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	like	the	earth	,	where	you	have	some	liquid	water	and	some	 clay 	 s 	 	--	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	end	up	with	 natural 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	which	 spontane 	 ously 	 	form	 bubble 	 s 	 	.
but	 t 	 hose 	 	 bubble 	 s 	 	have	 membrane 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	the	membrane	of	every	cell	of	every	living	thing	on	earth	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	they	 re 	 ally 	 	help	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	like	 nuclei 	 c 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	like	rna	and	dna	,	stay	 in 	 side 	 	,	develop	,	change	,	divide	and	do	some	of	the	 process 	 es 	 	that	we	call	life	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	to	tell	you	the	 path 	 way 	 	in	which	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	answer	that	 big 	 ger 	 	question	about	the	 universal 	 ity 	 	of	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
and	in	a	sense	,	you	can	think	of	that	work	that	people	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	do	now	around	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	building	a	bridge	,	building	a	bridge	from	two	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	river	.
on	one	hand	,	on	the	left	bank	of	the	river	,	are	the	people	like	me	who	 stud 	 y 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	and	try	to	define	the	 environment 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	want	to	go	blind	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	too	 man 	 y 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	,	and	there	is	not	too	much	lab	,	and	there	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	human	time	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	do	all	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	what	we	are	building	from	the	left	side	of	the	river	.
from	the	right	bank	of	the	river	are	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	that	i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	where	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	that	,	and	it	 feed 	 s 	 	back	and	forth	,	and	we	hope	to	meet	in	the	middle	one	day	.
so	why	should	you	care	about	that	?
why	am	i	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	you	a	half	-	built	bridge	?
am	i	that	 charm 	 ing 	 	?
well	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	and	you	heard	some	of	them	in	the	short	talk	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	help	us	with	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 pro 	 found 	 	here	,	and	that	 deep 	 er 	 	,	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	point	is	that	science	is	in	the	process	of	 re 	 defi 	 ning 	 	life	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	.
and	that	is	going	to	change	our	 world 	 view 	 	in	a	 pro 	 found 	 	way	--	not	in	a	 dis 	 similar 	 	way	 a 	 s 	 	400	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	copernicus	'	act	did	,	by	changing	the	way	we	view	space	and	time	.
now	it	's	about	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	but	it	's	 equal 	 ly 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	.
and	half	the	time	,	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	it	's	related	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	sense	of	 in 	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	to	 human 	 kind 	 	,	to	the	earth	in	a	 big 	 ger 	 	space	.
and	the	more	we	learn	,	the	more	that	was	 reinforce 	 d 	 	.
you	've	all	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	in	school	--	how	small	the	earth	is	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	immense	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	the	 big 	 ger 	 	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	the	 big 	 ger 	 	that	 uni 	 verse 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	.
and	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	image	of	the	 tin 	 y 	 	,	blue	dot	.
 th 	 is 	 	pixel	is	the	earth	.
it	is	the	earth	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	.
it	is	 s 	 een 	 	from	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	from	 out 	 side 	 	the	orbit	of	saturn	.
but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
we	know	that	.
let	's	think	of	life	 a 	 s 	 	that	entire	planet	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	a	sense	,	it	is	.
the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	earth	.
life	on	earth	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	earth	.
and	let	's	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	the	rest	of	the	world	in	spatial	 term 	 s 	 	.
what	if	that	copernican	 in 	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	all	wrong	?
would	that	make	us	more	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?
let	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	try	that	.
so	in	space	,	the	earth	is	 ver 	 y 	 	small	.
can	you	imagine	how	small	it	is	?
let	me	try	it	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	let	's	say	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 observ 	 able 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	with	all	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	with	all	the	 star 	 s 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	from	here	to	here	.
do	you	know	what	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	life	in	 th 	 is 	 	 neck 	 tie 	 	will	be	?
it	will	be	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	single	,	small	atom	.
it	is	 un 	 imagin 	 ably 	 	small	.
we	ca	n't	imagine	it	.
i	mean	look	,	you	can	see	the	 neck 	 tie 	 	,	but	you	ca	n't	even	imagine	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	little	,	small	atom	.
but	that	's	not	the	whole	story	,	you	see	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	life	are	both	in	space	and	time	.
if	that	was	the	age	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	age	of	life	on	earth	.
think	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 old 	 est 	 	living	 thing 	 s 	 	on	earth	,	but	in	a	 cosm 	 ic 	 	proportion	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 in 	 significant 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	.
so	life	might	be	 in 	 significant 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	,	but	it	is	not	 in 	 significant 	 	in	time	.
life	and	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 compar 	 e 	 	to	each	other	like	a	child	and	a	parent	,	parent	and	 off 	 spring 	 	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tell	us	?
 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	that	 in 	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	paradigm	that	we	 some 	 how 	 	got	to	learn	from	the	copernican	principle	,	it	's	all	wrong	.
there	is	immense	,	 power 	 ful 	 	potential	in	life	in	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	now	that	we	know	that	 place 	 s 	 	like	the	earth	are	common	.
and	that	potential	,	that	 power 	 ful 	 	potential	,	is	 al 	 so 	 	our	potential	,	of	you	and	me	.
and	if	we	are	to	be	 steward 	 s 	 	of	our	planet	earth	and	 it 	 s 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	we	'd	better	understand	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
and	the	good	news	is	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	do	it	.
and	let	's	do	it	.
let	's	start	 th 	 is 	 	new	revolution	at	the	tail	end	of	the	old	one	,	with	synthetic	biology	 be 	 ing 	 	the	way	to	transform	both	our	environment	and	our	future	.
and	let	's	hope	that	we	can	build	 th 	 is 	 	bridge	together	and	meet	in	the	middle	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
