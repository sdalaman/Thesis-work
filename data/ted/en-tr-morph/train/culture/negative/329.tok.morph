ninety	-	nine	percent	of	us	have	the	dream	of	 listen 	 ers 	 	.
not	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 music 	 ians 	 	--	the	 listen 	 ers 	 	,	right	?
and	we	 crav 	 e 	 	one	thing	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	kind	of	do	n't	know	it	all	the	time	.
we	 crav 	 e 	 	to	be	in	the	room	with	the	 music 	 ian 	 	the	day	it	was	 record 	 ed 	 	,	the	day	it	was	 play 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	go	to	live	 concert 	 s 	 	,	and	we	get	that	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	.
but	then	we	listen	to	the	other	99	percent	of	our	stuff	 record 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	further	back	you	go	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	the	little	 rough 	 er 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	's	a	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
let	's	 separat 	 e 	 	the	performance	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	thing	,	out	from	the	 record 	 ing 	 	,	which	was	how	it	was	made	.
you	know	,	the	thing	with	 micro 	 phone 	 s 	 	in	the	room	and	all	that	day	.
but	the	performance	 it 	 self 	 	was	how	the	 music 	 ians 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	,	and	what	 instrument 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	using	.
and	it	's	the	data	 hid 	 den 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	 record 	 ing 	 	.
in	order	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	a	lot	of	 hard 	 ware 	 	and	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	 run 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 re 	 solution 	 	.
and	yamaha	 make 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	disklavier	pro	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	nice	grand	piano	there	.
and	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	it	's	going	to	do	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	but	full	of	 sole 	 noids 	 	,	and	fiber	 optic 	 s 	 	,	and	 computer 	 s 	 	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	.	the	highest	 re 	 solution 	 	out	of	japan	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	just	did	n't	work	 un 	 til 	 	we	could	cross	 th 	 is 	 	line	that	 say 	 s 	 	high	-	definition	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	cross	 th 	 is 	 	line	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 un 	 can 	 ny 	 	 val 	 ley 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	--	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	process	where	we	,	you	know	,	kind	of	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	computer	and	 digit 	 ize 	 	it	,	and	then	a	whole	lot	of	analysis	.
and	we	look	at	every	single	note	,	and	all	the	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 note 	 s 	 	:	how	hard	they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	,	and	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	held	down	,	and	how	you	move	the	 finger 	 s 	 	.
so	we	had	to	develop	a	whole	new	science	of	how	you	move	your	 finger 	 s 	 	.
and	,	you	know	,	it	's	a	thing	your	piano	teacher	 teach 	 es 	 	you	,	but	we	never	had	a	science	 be 	 hind 	 	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	start	with	glenn	gould	.
he	 di 	 ed 	 	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	and	was	born	75	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
was	a	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	pianist	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	great	cult	pianist	of	the	 t 	 went 	 ieth 	 	century	.
he	just	got	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	an	audience	,	and	felt	like	--	a	 perform 	 ing 	 	monkey	was	,	in	fact	,	his	term	.
so	he	 steppe 	 d 	 	back	,	and	did	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	the	 craft 	 ing 	 	of	his	work	.
and	gould	's	 special 	 ty 	 	was	 play 	 ing 	 	bach	.
his	 may 	 be 	 	most	famous	 record 	 ing 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	goldberg	 vari 	 ations 	 	.	``
bach	 on 	 ly 	 	wrote	 theme 	 s 	 	and	 vari 	 ations 	 	one	time	.
he	wrote	some	early	 piece 	 s 	 	,	but	late	in	his	life	,	in	his	mature	period	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	here	's	a	theme	--	30	 vari 	 ations 	 	.	``
in	fact	,	the	theme	is	n't	even	the	 melo 	 dy 	 	,	it	's	the	 bas 	 s 	 	line	.
and	gould	 record 	 ed 	 	it	in	two	major	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	you	may	know	about	,	one	in	mono	,	and	one	in	stereo	.
and	the	one	in	mono	,	by	the	way	,	he	used	the	 ped 	 al 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	he	got	 old 	 er 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	wait	a	minute	.
i	'm	going	to	get	 ver 	 y 	 	scientific	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	not	use	the	 ped 	 al 	 	.	``
what	i	'd	like	you	to	hear	live	is	the	1955	version	,	and	we	'll	play	the	first	couple	 piece 	 s 	 	of	it	.
glenn	gould	,	1955	.
how	about	that	?
so	let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	how	 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	.
first	of	all	,	let	me	get	you	to	the	end	step	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	--	we	have	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	complex	process	that	,	you	know	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	and	 music 	 ians 	 	and	so	on	,	but	when	we	're	all	 d 	 one 	 	,	we	know	that	the	ear	is	the	final	 ar 	 bit 	 er 	 	.
we	can	play	the	original	in	one	ear	,	and	a	new	 record 	 ing 	 	in	the	other	.
so	i	'm	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	you	right	now	,	what	you	just	heard	.
and	in	the	right	speaker	is	going	to	be	the	original	 record 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	left	speaker	is	going	to	be	the	new	 record 	 ing 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	of	an	instrument	just	like	that	one	,	and	i	'm	going	to	play	them	together	at	the	same	time	.
that	's	the	original	.	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	that	's	the	two	together	.
before	``	jurassic	park	,	``	there	was	no	science	for	how	skin	hung	off	of	muscle	,	right	?
so	,	in	the	video	world	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	invent	,	in	our	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	,	natural	behavior	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 put 	 ting 	 	a	science	 be 	 hind 	 	natural	behavior	.
and	then	you	heard	the	original	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	experience	.
and	the	experience	is	:	i	want	to	be	in	the	room	and	hear	the	 music 	 ians 	 	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	you	can	afford	to	buy	one	of	these	.
but	,	if	not	,	there	is	now	high	-	definition	surround	sound	.
and	i	got	to	tell	you	,	if	you	have	n't	heard	high	-	definition	surround	,	go	down	to	your	audio	 deal 	 er 	 	,	your	 audio 	 phil 	 e 	 	 deal 	 er 	 	.
it	's	so	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	regular	stereo	.
but	if	you	do	n't	have	that	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	listen	on	your	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	.
and	so	on	the	same	 dis 	 k 	 	we	have	five	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	sony	 ha 	 s 	 	five	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	you	could	listen	in	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	 bin 	 a 	 ural 	 	 record 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 d 	 um 	 my 	 	head	that	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	in	front	of	the	instrument	,	and	it	's	got	 micro 	 phone 	 s 	 	where	the	 ear 	 s 	 	are	.
and	when	you	put	on	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	and	you	listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	're	 in 	 side 	 	of	glenn	gould	's	body	.
and	it	is	a	 chuck 	 le 	 	 un 	 til 	 	,	you	know	,	the	 music 	 ians 	 	,	who	are	 music 	 ians 	 	who	play	the	piano	,	listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	say	,	``	i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	!	it	's	just	what	it	's	like	to	play	the	piano	.	``
 ex 	 cept 	 	now	you	're	 in 	 side 	 	glenn	gould	's	body	 play 	 ing 	 	the	piano	,	and	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	your	 finger 	 s 	 	are	making	the	 decision 	 s 	 	and	moving	through	the	whole	process	.
it	's	a	game	changer	.
here	's	now	 some 	 thing 	 	we	know	in	spectacular	quality	.
the	whole	process	is	 ver 	 y 	 	sensitive	to	temperature	and	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	.
what	you	heard	 to 	 day 	 	was	not	perfect	.
it	's	an	 am 	 al 	 gam 	 	of	wood	,	and	cast	iron	,	and	felt	,	and	steel	 string 	 s 	 	,	and	all	these	,	and	they	're	all	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	sensitive	to	temperature	and	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	.
so	when	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 record 	 ing 	 	session	,	you	get	to	stop	after	every	piece	and	 re 	 build 	 	the	piano	if	you	need	to	.
there	's	the	whole	action	there	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	,	kind	of	,	on	the	side	,	and	the	 d 	 um 	 my 	 	head	and	our	 record 	 ing 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	around	while	we	 re 	 build 	 	the	piano	.
 with 	 out 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	 date 	 s 	 	next	to	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	step	-	by	-	step	music	will	be	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	data	,	like	every	field	that	's	 occur 	 red 	 	in	the	past	35	or	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
audio	 ha 	 s 	 	come	 ver 	 y 	 	late	to	 th 	 is 	 	game	--	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 digit 	 izing 	 	,	and	bits	,	and	re	-	 master 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	data	that	it	was	made	from	,	which	is	how	it	was	 perform 	 ed 	 	.
and	audio	came	 ver 	 y 	 	late	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 ear 	 s 	 	are	so	hard	to	fool	--	they	're	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	,	and	they	're	wired	straight	to	our	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	and	you	ca	n't	trick	them	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
your	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	happy	with	some	color	and	 move 	 ment 	 	,	you	know	.
all	right	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	episode	of	``	star	trek	.	``
i	get	it	--	it	was	all	just	laid	in	for	me	 yester 	 day 	 	there	.
the	episode	of	``	star	trek	``	for	me	was	james	daly	 play 	 ed 	 	methuselah	--	remember	 th 	 is 	 	one	?
and	at	some	point	he	's	 danc 	 ing 	 	with	his	--	and	i	wo	n't	ruin	the	episode	for	you	,	from	1967	.
right	,	do	you	know	where	i	'm	going	?
and	nimoy	,	i	'm	sorry	,	spock	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	down	at	the	piano	,	and	he	 start 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	brahms	waltz	,	and	they	all	dance	to	it	.
and	then	spock	 turn 	 s 	 	round	,	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	james	,	i	know	all	of	the	brahms	 waltz 	 es 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	them	in	the	 categor 	 y 	 	.	``
that	's	where	i	'm	at	.
i	want	to	hear	the	 waltz 	 es 	 	brahms	did	n't	write	.
i	want	to	hear	the	 piece 	 s 	 	that	horowitz	did	n't	play	.
but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	're	on	a	path	now	,	when	we	get	to	data	,	that	we	can	distill	 style 	 s 	 	,	and	 template 	 s 	 	,	and	 formula 	 s 	 	,	and	all	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	happen	in	the	computer	 graphic 	 s 	 	world	.
it	's	now	coming	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
the	 transit 	 ion 	 	will	be	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	right	now	,	we	think	music	is	 note 	 s 	 	and	how	they	're	 play 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	coming	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	've	just	heard	was	a	computer	 play 	 ing 	 	data	--	no	glenn	gould	in	the	room	.
but	yet	,	it	was	human	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	you	'll	get	to	the	next	step	,	the	real	dream	of	 listen 	 ers 	 	.
every	time	you	listen	to	a	 record 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	every	time	you	take	out	your	ipod	and	 what 	 ever 	 	,	every	time	you	listen	to	it	,	it	's	the	same	thing	--	it	's	 froze 	 n 	 	.
would	n't	it	be	cool	if	every	time	you	 listen 	 ed 	 	,	it	could	be	different	?
 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	you	're	 s 	 add 	 er 	 	,	you	want	to	hear	your	song	,	the	same	song	,	 play 	 ed 	 	 s 	 add 	 er 	 	than	you	did	 yester 	 day 	 	.
you	want	to	hear	it	 play 	 ed 	 	by	different	 music 	 ians 	 	.
you	want	to	hear	it	in	different	rooms	and	 what 	 ever 	 	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	all	these	``	star	 trek 	 s 	 	,	``	and	they	're	all	 holo 	 deck 	 	 episode 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
every	time	i	listen	to	that	,	i	get	goose	 bump 	 s 	 	.
it	's	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
every	time	i	listen	to	that	 record 	 ing 	 	it	's	like	,	``	oh	my	god	,	i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	i	'm	in	the	same	room	.	i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	``
it	's	a	way	better	experience	than	 what 	 ever 	 	you	're	used	to	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	,	in	 what 	 ever 	 	form	.
and	 last 	 ly 	 	,	i	will	wrap	up	with	one	minute	of	art	tatum	.
so	i	've	 re 	 ally 	 	 over 	 shot 	 	my	budget	here	.
we	made	a	new	 record 	 ing 	 	of	him	 play 	 ing 	 	in	the	 s 	 hr 	 ine 	 	 audit 	 orium 	 	in	september	.
it	was	a	concert	he	 record 	 ed 	 	in	the	 s 	 hr 	 ine 	 	 audit 	 orium 	 	in	1949	.
and	i	've	got	to	tell	you	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	lab	where	we	build	and	measure	 every 	 thing 	 	,	back	in	raleigh	,	north	carolina	,	and	we	flew	out	to	los	angeles	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	company	,	i	did	n't	feel	real	 comfort 	 able 	 	about	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	.
that	's	a	real	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	when	all	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	's	come	out	and	a	whole	sony	team	,	and	people	are	going	to	be	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	in	the	audience	.
and	we	put	the	piano	on	the	sweet	spot	of	the	stage	in	the	 s 	 hr 	 ine 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 change 	 d 	 	since	1949	,	still	 seat 	 s 	 	6,000	people	.
and	on	the	sweet	spot	on	the	stage	,	tatum	 start 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	...
and	every	note	,	every	beat	,	every	slur	,	every	accent	,	every	 ped 	 al 	 	was	perfect	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 play 	 ed 	 	it	for	that	room	on	that	day	.
and	we	 capture 	 d 	 	all	that	data	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	i	want	you	to	hear	that	right	now	.
and	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	right	in	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 en 	 core 	 	he	used	to	do	.
it	's	one	minute	long	.
it	's	an	irish	jig	,	and	i	want	you	to	hear	his	humor	.
and	that	's	just	what	the	live	audience	did	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	michael	,	thank	you	for	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
