the	 decor 	 ative 	 	use	of	wire	in	southern	africa	 date 	 s 	 	back	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	 modern 	 ization 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	communication	and	a	whole	new	material	,	in	the	form	of	 tele 	 phone 	 	wire	.
 r 	 ural 	 	to	urban	 migr 	 ation 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	that	 new 	 found 	 	industrial	 material 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	replace	hard	-	to	-	come	-	by	natural	 grass 	 es 	 	.
so	,	here	you	can	see	the	change	from	use	--	 start 	 ing 	 	to	use	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
these	 piece 	 s 	 	date	back	from	the	'40s	to	the	late	'50s	.
in	the	'90s	,	my	interest	and	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	 transit 	 ional 	 	art	 form 	 s 	 	led	me	to	a	new	form	,	which	came	from	a	 squat 	 ter 	 	camp	 out 	 side 	 	durban	.
and	i	got	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	start	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	community	at	that	point	,	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	and	 mentor 	 ing 	 	them	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	scale	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	design	.
and	the	project	soon	grew	from	five	to	50	 weave 	 rs 	 	in	about	a	year	.
soon	we	had	 out 	 grown 	 	the	scrap	 yard 	 s 	 	,	what	they	could	provide	,	so	we	 coerc 	 ed 	 	a	wire	 manufactur 	 er 	 	to	help	us	,	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	supply	the	 material 	 s 	 	on	 bobb 	 in 	 s 	 	,	but	to	produce	to	our	color	 specific 	 ations 	 	.
at	the	same	time	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	well	,	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 possibil 	 ity 	 	here	to	produce	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 product 	 s 	 	,	away	from	the	ethnic	,	a	little	bit	more	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	.
so	i	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	whole	range	around	--	mass	-	 produce 	 d 	 	range	--	that	 obvious 	 ly 	 	fitted	 in 	 to 	 	a	much	 high 	 er 	 	-	end	decor	market	that	could	be	 export 	 ed 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	service	our	local	market	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	 experiment 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 shape 	 s 	 	,	 form 	 s 	 	.	the	scale	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	our	pet	project	.	it	's	 success 	 ful 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	running	for	12	 year 	 s 	 	.	and	we	supply	the	conran	 shop 	 s 	 	,	and	donna	karan	,	and	so	it	's	kind	of	great	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	group	,	our	main	group	of	 weave 	 rs 	 	.
they	come	on	a	 week 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	to	durban	.
they	all	have	bank	 account 	 s 	 	.
they	've	all	 move 	 d 	 	back	to	the	 r 	 ural 	 	area	where	they	came	from	.
it	's	a	 week 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 around 	 	of	production	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	community	that	i	 original 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	you	the	slide	of	.
and	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	 modern 	 ized 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	it	's	 support 	 ing 	 	work	for	300	 weave 	 rs 	 	.
and	the	rest	 say 	 s 	 	it	all	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
