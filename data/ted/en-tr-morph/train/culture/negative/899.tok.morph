it	can	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	the	ocean	.
and	it	can	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	what	human	health	is	.
and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	together	might	seem	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 daunt 	 ing 	 	task	,	but	what	i	'm	going	to	try	to	say	is	that	even	in	that	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	there	's	some	simple	 theme 	 s 	 	that	i	think	,	if	we	understand	,	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	move	forward	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	simple	 theme 	 s 	 	are	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	about	the	complex	science	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	all	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	know	.
and	i	'm	going	to	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	:	if	 mom 	 ma 	 	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	 no 	 body 	 	happy	.
we	know	that	,	right	?	we	've	 experience 	 d 	 	that	.
and	if	we	just	take	that	and	we	build	from	there	,	then	we	can	go	to	the	next	step	,	which	is	that	if	the	ocean	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	 no 	 body 	 	happy	.
that	's	the	theme	of	my	talk	.
and	we	're	making	the	ocean	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	shot	of	 can 	 nery 	 	row	in	1932	.
 can 	 nery 	 	row	,	at	the	time	,	had	the	 big 	 gest 	 	industrial	canning	operation	on	the	west	coast	.
we	 pil 	 ed 	 	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 poll 	 ution 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
rolf	bolin	,	who	was	a	professor	at	the	hopkin	's	marine	station	where	i	work	,	wrote	in	the	1940s	that	``	the	 fum 	 es 	 	from	the	 s 	 cum 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	on	the	 in 	 lets 	 	of	the	 ba 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	bad	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	lead	-	based	 paint 	 s 	 	black	.	``
people	 work 	 ing 	 	in	these	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	stay	there	all	day	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	smell	,	but	you	know	what	they	came	out	 say 	 ing 	 	?
they	say	,	``	you	know	what	you	smell	?
you	smell	money	.	``
that	 poll 	 ution 	 	was	money	to	that	community	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 deal 	 t 	 	with	the	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	 absorb 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	and	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	the	money	.
we	made	the	ocean	 un 	 happy 	 	;	we	made	people	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	,	and	we	made	them	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	.
the	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	ocean	health	and	human	health	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	based	 up 	 on 	 	 an 	 other 	 	couple	simple	 ad 	 age 	 s 	 	,	and	i	want	to	call	that	``	pinch	a	 min 	 now 	 	,	hurt	a	whale	.	``
the	pyramid	of	ocean	life	...
now	,	when	an	ecologist	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	--	i	have	to	tell	you	--	we	look	at	the	ocean	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	,	and	we	see	different	 thing 	 s 	 	than	when	a	regular	person	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	 be 	 cause 	 	when	an	ecologist	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	,	we	see	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	.
we	see	the	base	of	the	food	chain	,	the	plankton	,	the	small	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	see	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	are	food	to	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	pyramid	,	and	on	so	up	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
and	that	flow	,	that	flow	of	life	,	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	base	up	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	,	is	the	flow	that	 ecologist 	 s 	 	see	.
and	that	's	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	preserve	when	we	say	,	``	 s 	 ave 	 	the	ocean	.	heal	the	ocean	.	``
it	's	that	pyramid	.
now	why	 do 	 es 	 	that	matter	for	human	health	?
 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	jam	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	bottom	of	that	pyramid	that	should	n't	be	there	,	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
 pollutant 	 s 	 	,	some	 pollutant 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	us	:	 molecule 	 s 	 	like	pcbs	that	ca	n't	be	broken	down	by	our	bodies	.
and	they	go	in	the	base	of	that	pyramid	,	and	they	drift	up	;	they	're	 pass 	 ed 	 	up	that	way	,	on	to	 predator 	 s 	 	and	on	to	the	top	 predator 	 s 	 	,	and	in	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
now	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	that	home	,	i	thought	i	'd	invent	a	little	game	.
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	play	it	;	we	can	just	think	about	it	here	.
it	's	the	styrofoam	and	chocolate	game	.
imagine	that	when	we	got	on	 th 	 is 	 	boat	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 give 	 n 	 	two	styrofoam	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
ca	n't	do	much	with	them	:	put	them	in	your	pocket	.
suppose	the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	:	every	time	you	 off 	 er 	 	 some 	 body 	 	a	drink	,	you	give	them	the	drink	,	and	you	give	them	your	styrofoam	 peanut 	 s 	 	too	.
what	'll	happen	is	that	the	styrofoam	 peanut 	 s 	 	will	start	moving	through	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	here	,	and	they	will	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	the	 drunk 	 est 	 	,	 s 	 ting 	 iest 	 	people	.
there	's	no	 mechan 	 ism 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	game	for	them	to	go	 any 	 where 	 	but	 in 	 to 	 	a	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	pile	of	 in 	 digest 	 ible 	 	styrofoam	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	pdbs	in	 th 	 is 	 	food	pyramid	:	they	 accumul 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	top	of	it	.
now	suppose	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	styrofoam	 peanut 	 s 	 	,	we	take	these	 love 	 ly 	 	little	 chocolate 	 s 	 	that	we	get	and	we	had	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.
well	,	some	of	us	would	be	eating	 t 	 hose 	 	 chocolate 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 pass 	 ing 	 	them	around	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 accumul 	 ating 	 	,	they	will	just	pass	 in 	 to 	 	our	group	here	and	not	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	any	one	group	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 absorb 	 ed 	 	by	us	.
and	that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	pcb	and	,	say	,	 some 	 thing 	 	natural	like	an	 o 	 mega 	 	-	3	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	want	out	of	the	marine	food	chain	.
pcbs	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
we	have	great	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	that	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	.
pcbs	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	sarasota	 ba 	 y 	 	,	in	texas	,	in	north	carolina	.
they	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	food	chain	.
the	 dolphin 	 s 	 	eat	the	fish	that	have	pcbs	from	the	plankton	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	pcbs	,	 be 	 ing 	 	fat	-	soluble	,	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
now	,	a	dolphin	,	mother	dolphin	,	any	dolphin	--	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	way	that	a	pcb	can	get	out	of	a	dolphin	.
and	what	's	that	?
in	mother	's	milk	.
here	's	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	the	pcb	load	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	sarasota	 ba 	 y 	 	.
adult	 male 	 s 	 	:	a	huge	load	.
 juvenile 	 s 	 	:	a	huge	load	.
 female 	 s 	 	after	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 ca 	 lf 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 wean 	 ed 	 	:	a	lower	load	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 female 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 female 	 s 	 	are	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	pcbs	in	the	fat	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	mother	's	milk	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	do	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
the	death	rate	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	,	for	the	first	 ca 	 lf 	 	born	of	every	female	dolphin	,	is	60	to	80	percent	.
these	 mother 	 s 	 	pump	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 off 	 spring 	 	full	of	 th 	 is 	 	pollutant	,	and	most	of	them	die	.
now	,	the	mother	then	can	go	and	 re 	 produce 	 	,	but	what	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	price	to	pay	for	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	pollutant	in	these	 animal 	 s 	 	--	the	death	of	the	first	-	born	 ca 	 lf 	 	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	top	predator	in	the	ocean	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	.
that	top	predator	,	of	course	,	is	us	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	are	eating	meat	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	some	of	these	same	 place 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	whale	meat	that	i	 photograph 	 ed 	 	in	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	in	tokyo	--	or	is	it	?
in	fact	,	what	we	did	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	was	learn	how	to	smuggle	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	lab	 in 	 to 	 	tokyo	and	use	it	to	 genetic 	 ally 	 	test	the	dna	out	of	whale	meat	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	identify	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
and	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	whale	meat	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	whale	meat	.
some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	whale	meat	,	by	the	way	.
that	's	 an 	 other 	 	story	.
but	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	not	whale	meat	at	all	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 label 	 ed 	 	whale	meat	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	meat	.
some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	liver	.	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	 blu 	 b 	 ber 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	dolphin	 part 	 s 	 	had	a	huge	load	of	pcbs	,	 dioxin 	 s 	 	and	heavy	 metal 	 s 	 	.
and	that	huge	load	was	 pass 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	people	that	ate	 th 	 is 	 	meat	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	a	lot	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	meat	in	the	whale	meat	market	around	the	world	.
that	's	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 population 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	for	the	people	eating	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	know	that	that	's	toxic	meat	.
we	had	these	data	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	remember	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	my	desk	 be 	 ing 	 	about	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	in	the	world	who	 k 	 new 	 	that	whale	meat	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	in	these	 market 	 s 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	dolphin	meat	,	and	it	was	toxic	.
it	had	two	-	to	-	three	-	to	-	400	 time 	 s 	 	the	toxic	 load 	 s 	 	ever	 allow 	 ed 	 	by	the	epa	.
and	i	remember	there	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	my	desk	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	,	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	scientific	 discover 	 y 	 	,	``	but	it	was	so	awful	.
and	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	in	my	scientific	 care 	 er 	 	,	i	broke	scientific	 proto 	 col 	 	,	which	is	that	you	take	the	data	and	publish	them	in	scientific	 journal 	 s 	 	and	then	begin	to	talk	about	them	.
we	 s 	 ent 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	polite	letter	to	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	health	in	japan	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 toler 	 able 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	not	for	us	,	but	for	the	people	of	japan	 be 	 cause 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	who	may	be	 breast 	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	who	may	have	young	children	,	would	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	thought	was	 health 	 y 	 	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	toxic	.
that	led	to	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	other	 campaign 	 s 	 	in	japan	,	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	proud	to	say	that	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	buy	 any 	 thing 	 	in	japan	that	's	 label 	 ed 	 	 in 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	still	selling	whale	meat	,	which	i	 believ 	 e 	 	they	should	n't	.
but	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	's	 label 	 ed 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	and	you	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	going	to	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	toxic	dolphin	meat	 in 	 stead 	 	.
it	is	n't	just	there	that	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	but	in	a	natural	diet	of	some	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	the	canadian	 arc 	 tic 	 	and	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	in	the	european	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	a	natural	diet	of	 seal 	 s 	 	and	 whale 	 s 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	an	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	pcbs	that	have	 gather 	 ed 	 	up	from	all	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	these	women	.
these	women	have	toxic	breast	milk	.
they	can	not	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	 the 	 ir 	 	breast	milk	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	these	 toxin 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	food	chain	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	part	of	the	world	's	ocean	pyramid	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 system 	 s 	 	are	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	can	be	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	.
and	the	world	's	attention	on	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	last	decade	 ha 	 s 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	the	problem	for	these	women	,	not	by	changing	the	pyramid	,	but	by	changing	what	they	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	eat	out	of	it	.
we	've	taken	them	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	pyramid	in	order	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
that	's	a	good	thing	for	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 a 	 cute 	 	problem	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	solve	the	pyramid	problem	.
there	's	other	ways	of	 break 	 ing 	 	the	pyramid	.
the	pyramid	,	if	we	jam	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	bottom	,	can	get	 back 	 ed 	 	up	like	a	 sew 	 er 	 	line	that	's	 clog 	 ged 	 	.
and	if	we	jam	 nutrient 	 s 	 	,	 sew 	 age 	 	,	 fertil 	 izer 	 	in	the	base	of	that	food	pyramid	,	it	can	back	up	all	through	it	.
we	end	up	with	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	about	before	:	red	 tide 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	are	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	toxic	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	through	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	 neuro 	 logical 	 	damage	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	bacteria	,	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	viruses	in	the	ocean	.
these	are	two	 shot 	 s 	 	of	a	red	tide	coming	on	shore	here	and	a	bacteria	in	the	 gen 	 us 	 	vibrio	,	which	 include 	 s 	 	the	 gen 	 us 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	cholera	in	it	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 s 	 een 	 	a	``	beach	closed	``	sign	?
why	 do 	 es 	 	that	happen	?
it	 happen 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 jamm 	 ed 	 	so	much	 in 	 to 	 	the	base	of	the	natural	ocean	pyramid	that	these	bacteria	clog	it	up	and	 over 	 fill 	 	onto	our	 beach 	 es 	 	.
often	what	 jam 	 s 	 	us	up	is	 sew 	 age 	 	.
now	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	ever	gone	to	a	state	park	or	a	national	park	where	you	had	a	big	sign	at	the	front	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	closed	 be 	 cause 	 	human	 sew 	 age 	 	is	so	far	over	 th 	 is 	 	park	that	you	ca	n't	use	it	``	?
not	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.	we	would	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	that	.
we	would	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	our	 park 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 swamp 	 ed 	 	by	human	 sew 	 age 	 	,	but	 beach 	 es 	 	are	closed	a	lot	in	our	country	.
they	're	closed	more	and	more	and	more	all	around	the	world	for	the	same	reason	,	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	that	either	.
it	's	not	just	a	question	of	 clean 	 lines 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	question	of	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	then	turn	 in 	 to 	 	human	disease	.
these	 vibrio 	 s 	 	,	these	bacteria	,	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	infect	people	.

they	're	a	 tin 	 y 	 	fraction	of	an	inch	long	,	and	they	can	carry	on	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 leg 	 s 	 	some	of	the	cholera	bacteria	that	then	 lead 	 s 	 	to	human	disease	.

so	what	do	you	do	?
we	have	major	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 system 	 	flow	that	the	pyramid	may	not	be	 work 	 ing 	 	so	well	,	that	the	flow	from	the	base	up	 in 	 to 	 	it	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 block 	 ed 	 	and	 clog 	 ged 	 	.
what	do	you	do	when	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	flow	?
well	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	could	do	.
you	could	call	joe	the	 plumb 	 er 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
and	he	could	come	in	and	fix	the	flow	.
but	in	fact	,	if	you	look	around	the	world	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	there	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	for	where	we	may	be	able	to	fix	 problem 	 s 	 	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	 problem 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	,	where	people	have	come	to	 grip 	 s 	 	with	these	 issue 	 s 	 	and	 beg 	 un 	 	to	turn	them	around	.
monterey	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 show 	 ing 	 	how	much	we	had	 di 	 stress 	 ed 	 	the	monterey	 ba 	 y 	 	 eco 	 system 	 	with	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	the	canning	industry	and	all	of	the	 attend 	 ant 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
in	1932	,	that	's	the	picture	.
in	2009	,	the	picture	is	 dramat 	 ically 	 	different	.
the	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	are	gone	.	the	 poll 	 ution 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ab 	 ated 	 	.
but	there	's	a	 great 	 er 	 	sense	here	that	what	the	individual	 commun 	 ities 	 	need	is	 work 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
they	need	a	 function 	 ing 	 	pyramid	from	the	base	all	the	way	to	the	top	.
and	that	pyramid	in	monterey	,	right	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 effort 	 s 	 	of	a	lot	of	different	people	,	is	 function 	 ing 	 	better	than	it	's	ever	 function 	 ed 	 	for	the	last	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	did	n't	happen	 accident 	 ally 	 	.
it	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	put	 the 	 ir 	 	time	and	effort	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	spirit	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
on	the	left	there	,	julia	platt	,	the	mayor	of	my	little	 home 	 town 	 	in	 pac 	 ific 	 	grove	.
at	74	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 be 	 came 	 	mayor	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	had	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	protect	the	ocean	.
in	1931	,	she	 produce 	 d 	 	california	's	first	community	-	based	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	,	right	next	to	the	 big 	 gest 	 	polluting	 can 	 nery 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	julia	 k 	 new 	 	that	when	the	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	gone	,	the	ocean	 need 	 ed 	 	a	place	to	grow	from	,	that	the	ocean	 need 	 ed 	 	a	place	to	spark	a	seed	,	and	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	provide	that	seed	.
other	people	,	like	david	packard	and	julie	packard	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 instrument 	 al 	 	in	producing	the	monterey	 ba 	 y 	 	 aqua 	 rium 	 	to	lock	 in 	 to 	 	people	's	 not 	 ion 	 	that	the	ocean	and	the	health	of	the	ocean	 eco 	 system 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	area	 a 	 s 	 	eating	the	 eco 	 system 	 	would	be	.
that	change	in	 think 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	shift	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 fortune 	 s 	 	of	monterey	 ba 	 y 	 	,	but	other	 place 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
well	,	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	the	thought	that	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	here	is	protect	 th 	 is 	 	ocean	pyramid	,	and	that	ocean	pyramid	 connect 	 s 	 	to	our	own	pyramid	of	life	.
it	's	an	ocean	planet	,	and	we	think	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	terrestrial	species	,	but	the	pyramid	of	life	in	the	ocean	and	our	own	 live 	 s 	 	on	land	are	 intric 	 ate 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	through	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	ocean	 be 	 ing 	 	 health 	 y 	 	that	we	can	remain	 health 	 y 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
