 compass 	 ion 	 	:	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	look	like	?
come	with	me	to	915	south	bloodworth	street	in	raleigh	,	north	carolina	,	where	i	grew	up	.
if	you	come	in	you	will	see	us	:	 even 	 ing 	 	time	,	at	table	--	set	for	ten	but	not	 al 	 ways 	 	all	 seat 	 s 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	--	at	the	point	when	 d 	 inner 	 	is	ready	to	be	 serv 	 ed 	 	.
since	mom	had	eight	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	she	 s 	 aid 	 	she	could	n't	tell	who	was	who	and	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
before	we	could	eat	,	she	would	ask	,	``	are	all	the	children	in	?	``
and	if	 some 	 one 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	we	would	have	to	,	we	say	,	``	fix	a	plate	``	for	that	person	,	put	it	in	the	oven	,	then	we	could	say	grace	,	and	we	could	eat	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	table	,	there	was	a	ritual	in	our	family	:	when	 some 	 thing 	 	significant	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	for	any	one	of	us	--	 whet 	 her 	 	mom	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	 elect 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	pta	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	dad	had	gotten	an	 assign 	 ment 	 	at	the	college	of	our	denomination	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	 some 	 one 	 	had	won	the	jabberwocky	contest	for	talent	--	the	ritual	at	the	family	was	,	once	the	 announce 	 ment 	 	is	made	,	we	must	take	five	,	ten	 minute 	 s 	 	to	do	what	we	call	``	make	over	``	that	person	--	that	is	,	to	make	a	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 	over	the	one	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 honor 	 ed 	 	in	some	way	.
for	when	one	is	 honor 	 ed 	 	,	all	are	 honor 	 ed 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	we	had	to	make	a	report	on	our	 extend 	 ed 	 	``	 visit 	 ed 	 	``	 member 	 s 	 	,	that	is	,	 extend 	 ed 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	family	,	sick	and	 elder 	 ly 	 	,	shut	in	.
my	task	was	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	once	a	week	,	to	visit	mother	lassiter	who	lived	on	east	street	,	mother	williamson	who	lived	on	bledsoe	 a 	 venue 	 	,	and	mother	lathers	who	lived	on	oberlin	road	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	old	and	 in 	 firm 	 	,	and	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	go	by	to	see	if	they	 need 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
for	mom	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	to	be	family	,	is	to	care	and	share	and	to	look	out	for	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
they	are	our	family	.	``
and	,	of	course	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	there	was	a	 bon 	 us 	 	for	going	.
they	would	 off 	 er 	 	 sweet 	 s 	 	or	money	.
mom	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	if	they	ask	you	what	it	 cost 	 s 	 	to	either	go	 shop 	 ping 	 	for	them	,	you	must	 al 	 ways 	 	say	,	'	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	'	and	if	they	insist	,	say	,	'	 what 	 ever 	 	you	mind	to	give	me	.	'	``	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	nature	of	 be 	 ing 	 	at	that	table	.
in	fact	,	she	 indic 	 ated 	 	that	if	we	would	do	that	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	would	we	have	the	joy	of	 receiv 	 ing 	 	the	 grat 	 itude 	 	from	the	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	 extend 	 ed 	 	family	,	but	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	even	god	will	 s 	 mile 	 	,	and	when	god	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	,	there	is	peace	,	and	justice	,	and	joy	.	``
so	,	at	the	table	at	915	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
of	course	,	it	was	a	 mini 	 ster 	 	's	family	,	so	we	had	to	add	god	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	so	,	i	came	to	think	that	mama	 e 	 ternal 	 	,	mama	 e 	 ternal 	 	,	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	:	are	all	the	children	in	?
and	if	we	had	 be 	 en 	 	 faith 	 ful 	 	in	 car 	 ing 	 	and	sharing	,	we	had	the	sense	that	justice	and	peace	would	have	a	chance	in	the	world	.
now	,	it	was	not	 al 	 ways 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	at	that	table	.
let	me	explain	a	point	at	which	we	did	not	rise	to	the	occasion	.
it	was	christmas	,	and	at	our	family	,	oh	,	what	a	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
christmas	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	where	we	open	up	our	 gift 	 s 	 	,	where	we	have	special	 pray 	 ers 	 	,	and	where	we	get	to	the	old	 up 	 right 	 	piano	and	we	would	 s 	 ing 	 	 car 	 ol 	 s 	 	.	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 intima 	 te 	 	moment	.
in	fact	,	you	could	come	down	to	the	tree	to	get	your	 gift 	 s 	 	and	get	ready	to	 s 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	get	ready	for	 break 	 fast 	 	 with 	 out 	 	even	taking	a	bath	or	 get 	 ting 	 	 dress 	 ed 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	 d 	 addy 	 	 mess 	 ed 	 	it	up	.
there	was	a	member	of	his	staff	who	did	not	have	any	place	on	that	 part 	 icular 	 	christmas	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	.
and	 d 	 addy 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	elder	revels	to	the	christmas	family	 celebr 	 ation 	 	.
we	thought	he	must	be	out	of	his	mind	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	time	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 intima 	 te 	 	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	when	we	can	just	be	who	we	are	,	and	now	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 stuff 	 y 	 	brother	with	his	shirt	and	tie	on	,	while	we	are	still	in	our	pjs	.
why	would	 d 	 addy 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	elder	revels	?
any	other	time	,	but	not	to	the	christmas	 celebr 	 ation 	 	.
and	mom	 over 	 heard 	 	us	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	what	?	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	the	nature	of	 th 	 is 	 	 celebr 	 ation 	 	,	it	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	time	where	you	extend	the	circle	of	love	.
that	's	what	the	 celebr 	 ation 	 	is	all	about	.
it	's	time	to	make	space	,	to	share	the	 enjoy 	 ment 	 	of	life	in	a	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	community	.	``
so	,	we	 suck 	 ed 	 	up	.
but	growing	up	at	915	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	was	not	a	word	to	be	 debate 	 d 	 	;	it	was	a	 sens 	 ibility 	 	to	how	we	are	together	.
we	are	 sister 	 s 	 	and	 brother 	 s 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	together	.
and	,	like	chief	seattle	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	did	not	spin	the	web	of	life	.
we	're	all	 strand 	 s 	 	in	it	.
and	 what 	 ever 	 	we	do	to	the	web	,	we	do	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	``
now	that	's	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	let	me	tell	you	,	i	kind	of	look	at	the	world	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
i	see	 picture 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	now	,	that	's	 compass 	 ion 	 	.	``
a	 harvest 	 ed 	 	field	of	grain	,	with	some	grain	in	the	 corner 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 mind 	 ing 	 	me	of	the	hebrew	tradition	that	you	may	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	harvest	,	but	you	must	 al 	 ways 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	some	on	the	 edge 	 s 	 	,	just	in	case	there	's	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	not	had	the	share	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	good	nurture	.
talk	about	a	picture	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
i	see	--	 al 	 ways 	 	,	it	 stir 	 s 	 	my	heart	--	a	picture	of	dr.	martin	luther	king	,	jr	.
 walk 	 ing 	 	arm	in	arm	with	andy	young	and	rabbi	heschel	and	 may 	 be 	 	thich	nhat	hanh	and	some	of	the	other	 saint 	 s 	 	 assemble 	 d 	 	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	bridge	and	going	 in 	 to 	 	selma	.
just	a	photograph	.
arm	in	arm	for	struggle	.
 suffer 	 ing 	 	together	in	a	common	hope	that	we	can	be	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 accident 	 s 	 	of	our	birth	or	our	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	 rob 	 bing 	 	us	of	a	sense	of	 un 	 ity 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	picture	.	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	.	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	like	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
when	dr.	martin	luther	king	,	jr.	was	 assassin 	 ated 	 	,	that	day	,	 every 	 body 	 	in	my	community	was	 up 	 set 	 	.
you	heard	about	 riot 	 s 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	land	.
bobby	kennedy	was	 schedule 	 d 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	an	inner	city	 mess 	 age 	 	in	indianapolis	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	picture	.	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	going	to	be	too	 volatil 	 e 	 	for	you	to	go	.	``
he	 insist 	 ed 	 	,	``	i	must	go	.	``
so	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	 flat 	 bed 	 	truck	,	the	 elder 	 s 	 	of	the	community	are	there	,	and	bobby	 stand 	 s 	 	up	and	 say 	 s 	 	to	the	people	,	``	i	have	bad	news	for	you	.
some	of	you	may	not	have	heard	that	dr.	king	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 assassin 	 ated 	 	.
i	know	that	you	are	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	and	i	know	that	you	would	 al 	 most 	 	wish	to	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	enter	now	 in 	 to 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	 re 	 venge 	 	.	but	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	you	to	know	is	that	i	know	how	you	feel	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	 some 	 one 	 	dear	to	me	 snatch 	 ed 	 	away	.
i	know	how	you	feel	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	hope	that	you	will	have	the	strength	to	do	what	i	did	.
i	 allow 	 ed 	 	my	anger	,	my	 bitter 	 ness 	 	,	my	grief	to	 s 	 im 	 mer 	 	a	while	,	and	then	i	made	up	my	mind	that	i	was	going	to	make	a	different	world	,	and	we	can	do	that	together	.	``
that	's	a	picture	.	 compass 	 ion 	 	?	i	think	i	see	it	.
i	saw	it	when	the	dalai	lama	came	to	the	 river 	 side 	 	church	while	i	was	a	pastor	,	and	he	 invit 	 ed 	 	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	of	faith	 tradition 	 s 	 	from	all	around	the	world	.
he	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	give	a	 mess 	 age 	 	,	and	they	each	read	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	language	a	central	 affirm 	 ation 	 	,	and	that	was	some	version	of	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	:	``	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	that	 other 	 s 	 	would	do	 un 	 to 	 	you	,	do	 al 	 so 	 	 un 	 to 	 	them	.	``
twelve	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 ecclesiast 	 ical 	 	or	cultural	or	 trib 	 al 	 	attire	 affirm 	 ing 	 	one	 mess 	 age 	 	.
we	are	so	 connect 	 ed 	 	that	we	must	treat	each	other	 a 	 s 	 	if	an	action	 to 	 ward 	 	you	is	an	action	 to 	 ward 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
one	more	picture	while	i	'm	 stink 	 ing 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 river 	 side 	 	church	:	9/11	.	last	night	at	 cha 	 grin 	 	fall	,	a	 news 	 paper 	 man 	 	and	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	guy	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	 even 	 ing 	 	,	when	a	service	was	held	at	the	 river 	 side 	 	church	,	we	carried	it	on	our	station	in	 th 	 is 	 	city	.
it	was	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	one	of	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	life	together	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
but	you	 invit 	 ed 	 	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	of	all	of	the	 tradition 	 s 	 	to	come	,	and	you	 invit 	 ed 	 	them	.
'	find	out	what	it	is	in	your	tradition	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	what	to	do	when	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 humil 	 iated 	 	,	when	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 despis 	 ed 	 	and	 reject 	 ed 	 	.	'	and	they	all	spoke	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 tradition 	 s 	 	,	a	word	about	the	 heal 	 ing 	 	power	of	 solid 	 arity 	 	,	one	with	the	other	.	``
i	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	sense	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	sort	of	 a 	 s 	 	second	nature	,	but	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	 preach 	 er 	 	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 preach 	 er 	 	,	i	got	a	job	.	i	got	to	preach	the	stuff	,	but	i	got	to	do	it	too	.
or	,	 a 	 s 	 	father	divine	in	harlem	used	to	say	to	 folk 	 s 	 	,	``	some	people	preach	the	 go 	 s 	 pel 	 	.
i	have	to	 tangibil 	 itate 	 	the	 go 	 s 	 pel 	 	.	``
so	,	the	real	issue	is	:	how	do	you	 tangibil 	 itate 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	?
how	do	you	make	it	real	?
my	faith	 ha 	 s 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	 lift 	 ed 	 	up	the	ideal	,	and	 challeng 	 ed 	 	me	when	i	fell	 be 	 neath 	 	it	.
in	my	tradition	,	there	is	a	gift	that	we	have	made	to	other	 tradition 	 s 	 	--	to	 every 	 body 	 	around	the	world	who	 know 	 s 	 	the	story	of	the	``	good	samaritan	.	``
 man 	 y 	 	people	think	of	it	 prim 	 arily 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 char 	 ity 	 	,	random	 act 	 s 	 	of	 kind 	 ness 	 	.
but	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	that	text	a	little	more	 thorough 	 ly 	 	,	you	will	discover	that	a	question	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	raised	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 par 	 able 	 	.
the	question	was	:	``	what	is	the	 great 	 est 	 	 command 	 ment 	 	?	``
and	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	jesus	,	the	word	 come 	 s 	 	forth	,	``	you	must	love	 your 	 self 	 	,	you	must	love	the	lord	your	god	with	all	your	heart	,	mind	and	soul	,	and	your	neighbor	 a 	 s 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.	``
and	then	the	person	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	well	,	what	do	you	mean	,	'	neighbor	?	'	``	and	he	 answer 	 ed 	 	it	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	story	of	the	man	who	fell	among	 th 	 iev 	 es 	 	,	and	how	religious	 author 	 ities 	 	went	the	other	way	,	and	how	 the 	 ir 	 	 support 	 ers 	 	in	the	 congreg 	 ation 	 	went	the	other	way	;	but	an	 un 	 suspect 	 ing 	 	,	 despis 	 ed 	 	person	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	saw	the	man	in	need	,	 provide 	 d 	 	oil	and	wine	for	his	 wound 	 s 	 	,	put	him	on	his	own	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	and	took	him	to	the	 in 	 n 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 in 	 n 	 keeper 	 	,	``	take	care	of	him	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 initi 	 al 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	but	if	 need 	 s 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	you	provide	them	.
and	 what 	 ever 	 	else	is	 need 	 ed 	 	,	i	will	provide	it	and	pay	for	it	when	i	return	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	me	to	be	a	 deepen 	 ing 	 	of	the	sense	of	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	a	good	samaritan	.
a	good	samaritan	is	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	one	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	heart	is	 touch 	 ed 	 	in	an	 im 	 mediate 	 	act	of	care	and	 char 	 ity 	 	,	but	one	who	 provide 	 s 	 	a	system	of	 sustain 	 ed 	 	care	--	i	like	that	,	'	a	system	of	 sustain 	 ed 	 	care	'	--	in	the	 in 	 n 	 	,	take	care	.
i	think	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	one	time	when	the	 b 	 ible 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	about	a	 health 	 care 	 	system	and	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	do	 what 	 ever 	 	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	--	that	all	god	's	children	would	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 need 	 s 	 	 car 	 ed 	 	for	,	so	that	we	could	answer	when	 mom 	 my 	 	 e 	 ternal 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	,	``	in	 regard 	 s 	 	to	health	,	are	all	the	children	in	?	``	and	we	could	say	 y 	 es 	 	.
oh	,	what	a	joy	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	be	a	person	seeking	to	 tangibil 	 itate 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
i	recall	that	my	work	 a 	 s 	 	a	pastor	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	 car 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	spiritual	 need 	 s 	 	;	 be 	 ing 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	for	housing	,	for	 health 	 care 	 	,	for	the	 prisoner 	 s 	 	,	for	the	 in 	 firm 	 	,	for	children	--	even	the	foster	care	children	for	whom	no	one	can	even	keep	a	record	where	they	 start 	 ed 	 	off	,	where	they	are	going	.
to	be	a	pastor	is	to	care	for	these	individual	 need 	 s 	 	.
but	now	,	to	be	a	good	samaritan	--	and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	say	,	and	to	be	a	good	american	--	for	me	,	is	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	 congratula 	 te 	 	 my 	 self 	 	for	the	individual	 act 	 s 	 	of	care	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	 take 	 s 	 	on	a	corporate	dynamic	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 what 	 ever 	 	we	did	around	that	table	at	bloodworth	street	must	be	 d 	 one 	 	around	 table 	 s 	 	and	 ritual 	 s 	 	of	faith	 un 	 til 	 	we	 be 	 come 	 	that	family	,	that	family	together	that	 understand 	 s 	 	the	nature	of	our	 un 	 ity 	 	.
we	are	one	people	together	.
so	,	let	me	explain	to	you	what	i	mean	when	i	think	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	why	i	think	it	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	that	right	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	would	decide	to	establish	 th 	 is 	 	 chart 	 er 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
the	reason	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	time	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	is	the	time	that	,	 biblical 	 ly 	 	,	we	would	speak	of	 a 	 s 	 	the	day	,	or	the	year	,	of	god	's	favor	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	season	of	grace	.
 un 	 usual 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	happen	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	 par 	 don 	 	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	black	man	,	for	 celebr 	 ating 	 	that	the	election	of	obama	was	an	 un 	 usual 	 	sign	of	the	fact	that	it	is	a	year	of	favor	.
and	yet	,	there	is	so	much	more	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
we	need	to	 br 	 ing 	 	health	and	food	and	education	and	respect	for	all	god	's	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	all	god	's	children	,	 remember 	 ing 	 	mama	 e 	 ternal 	 	.
now	,	let	me	close	my	 comment 	 s 	 	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	that	 when 	 ever 	 	i	feel	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	,	it	 usual 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	the	form	of	verse	.
and	so	i	want	to	close	with	a	little	song	.
