what	i	want	to	tell	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	how	i	see	 robot 	 s 	 	 invad 	 ing 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	at	 multi 	 ple 	 	 level 	 s 	 	,	over	 multi 	 ple 	 	 time 	 scale 	 s 	 	.
and	when	i	look	out	in	the	future	,	i	ca	n't	imagine	a	world	,	500	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	where	we	do	n't	have	 robot 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
 assum 	 ing 	 	--	 de 	 spite 	 	all	the	 di 	 re 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	people	about	our	future	--	 assum 	 ing 	 	we	're	still	around	,	i	ca	n't	imagine	the	world	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 populate 	 d 	 	with	 robot 	 s 	 	.
and	then	the	question	is	,	well	,	if	they	're	going	to	be	here	in	500	 year 	 s 	 	,	are	they	going	to	be	 every 	 where 	 	 soon 	 er 	 	than	that	?
are	they	going	to	be	around	in	50	 year 	 s 	 	?
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	think	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	--	there	's	going	to	be	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 robot 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	in	fact	i	think	that	's	going	to	be	a	lot	 soon 	 er 	 	than	that	.
i	think	we	're	sort	of	on	the	 cus 	 p 	 	of	 robot 	 s 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	common	,	and	i	think	we	're	sort	of	around	1978	or	1980	in	personal	computer	 year 	 s 	 	,	where	the	first	few	 robot 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	appear	.
 computer 	 s 	 	sort	of	came	around	through	 game 	 s 	 	and	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
and	you	know	,	the	first	computer	most	people	had	in	the	house	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	computer	to	play	pong	,	a	little	 micro 	 processor 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	other	 game 	 s 	 	that	came	after	that	.
and	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	that	same	sort	of	thing	with	 robot 	 s 	 	:	lego	mindstorms	,	furbies	--	who	here	--	did	 any 	 one 	 	here	have	a	furby	?
 yea 	 h 	 	,	there	's	38	million	of	them	 s 	 old 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
they	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	common	.	and	they	're	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	robot	,	a	simple	robot	with	some	 sensor 	 s 	 	,	a	little	bit	of	 process 	 ing 	 	 actu 	 ation 	 	.
on	the	right	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	robot	doll	,	who	you	could	get	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	just	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	,	when	there	was	a	lot	of	sort	of	amateur	 interact 	 ion 	 	over	 computer 	 s 	 	,	you	can	now	get	 vari 	 ous 	 	 hack 	 ing 	 	 kit 	 s 	 	,	how	-	to	-	hack	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	on	the	left	there	is	a	platform	from	evolution	 robotic 	 s 	 	,	where	you	put	a	pc	on	,	and	you	program	 th 	 is 	 	thing	with	a	gui	to	wander	around	your	house	and	do	 vari 	 ous 	 	stuff	.
and	then	there	's	a	 high 	 er 	 	price	point	sort	of	robot	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	--	the	sony	aibo	.	and	on	the	right	there	,	is	one	that	the	nec	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	the	papero	,	which	i	do	n't	think	they	're	going	to	 re 	 lease 	 	.
but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	are	out	there	.
and	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	over	the	last	two	or	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	lawn	-	 mow 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	,	husqvarna	on	the	bottom	,	friendly	 robotic 	 s 	 	on	top	there	,	an	israeli	company	.
and	then	in	the	last	12	 month 	 s 	 	or	so	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	see	a	bunch	of	home	-	 clean 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	appear	.
the	top	left	one	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	home	-	 clean 	 ing 	 	robot	from	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	dyson	,	in	the	u.k.	 ex 	 cept 	 	it	was	so	expensive	--	3,500	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	they	did	n't	 re 	 lease 	 	it	.
but	at	the	bottom	left	,	you	see	electrolux	,	which	is	on	sale	.
 an 	 other 	 	one	from	karcher	.
at	the	bottom	right	is	one	that	i	built	in	my	lab	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	we	 final 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	that	 in 	 to 	 	a	product	.
and	let	me	just	show	you	that	.
we	're	going	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	away	i	think	,	chris	 s 	 aid 	 	,	after	the	talk	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	robot	that	you	can	go	out	and	buy	,	and	that	will	clean	up	your	floor	.
and	it	 start 	 s 	 	off	sort	of	just	going	around	in	ever	-	increasing	 circle 	 s 	 	.
if	it	 hit 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	you	people	see	that	?
now	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	wall	-	 follow 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 follow 	 ing 	 	around	my	feet	to	clean	up	around	me	.	let	's	see	,	let	's	--	oh	,	who	stole	my	rice	krispies	?	they	stole	my	rice	krispies	!
do	n't	worry	,	relax	,	no	,	relax	,	it	's	a	robot	,	it	's	smart	!
see	,	the	three	-	year	-	old	 kid 	 s 	 	,	they	do	n't	worry	about	it	.
it	's	grown	-	 up 	 s 	 	that	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 up 	 set 	 	.
we	'll	just	put	some	crap	here	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	see	--	so	,	i	put	a	bunch	of	rice	krispies	there	,	i	put	some	 penni 	 es 	 	,	let	's	just	shoot	it	at	that	,	see	if	it	 clean 	 s 	 	up	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	ok	.	so	--	we	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	that	for	 lat 	 er 	 	.
part	of	the	trick	was	building	a	better	 clean 	 ing 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	;	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	on	board	was	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	.
and	that	's	true	with	a	lot	of	 robot 	 s 	 	.
we	've	all	,	i	think	,	 be 	 come 	 	,	sort	of	 computation 	 al 	 	 chauvinist 	 s 	 	,	and	think	that	computation	is	 every 	 thing 	 	,	but	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	still	matter	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	robot	,	the	packbot	,	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	building	for	a	bunch	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 militar 	 y 	 	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	robot	,	to	go	in	 a 	 head 	 	of	 troop 	 s 	 	--	looking	at	 cave 	 s 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	.
but	we	had	to	make	it	 fair 	 ly 	 	 ro 	 bust 	 	,	much	more	 ro 	 bust 	 	than	the	 robot 	 s 	 	we	build	in	our	 lab 	 s 	 	.
on	board	that	robot	is	a	pc	running	linux	.
it	can	 with 	 stand 	 	a	400g	shock	.	the	robot	 ha 	 s 	 	local	 intellig 	 ence 	 	:	it	can	flip	 it 	 self 	 	over	,	can	get	 it 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	communication	range	,	can	go	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	et	 ce 	 tera 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	local	 navig 	 ation 	 	there	.
a	soldier	 give 	 s 	 	it	a	command	to	go	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
that	was	not	a	controlled	 d 	 escent 	 	.
now	it	's	going	to	head	off	.
and	the	big	 break 	 through 	 	for	these	 robot 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	was	september	11th	.
we	had	the	 robot 	 s 	 	down	at	the	world	trade	center	late	that	 even 	 ing 	 	.
could	n't	do	a	lot	in	the	main	 rub 	 ble 	 	pile	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	too	--	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	left	to	do	.
but	we	did	go	 in 	 to 	 	all	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	 building 	 s 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 evacuate 	 d 	 	,	and	 search 	 ed 	 	for	possible	 surviv 	 ors 	 	in	the	 building 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	too	 danger 	 ous 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	.
let	's	run	 th 	 is 	 	video	.
 report 	 er 	 	:	...	 battle 	 field 	 	 companion 	 s 	 	are	 help 	 ing 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	combat	 risk 	 s 	 	.
nick	robertson	 ha 	 s 	 	that	story	.
rodney	brooks	:	can	we	have	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	these	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	good	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 corp 	 or 	 al 	 	who	had	 s 	 een 	 	a	robot	two	 week 	 s 	 	 previous 	 ly 	 	.
he	's	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 cave 	 s 	 	,	looking	at	what	's	going	on	.
the	robot	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	autonomous	.
the	worst	thing	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	cave	so	far	was	one	of	the	 robot 	 s 	 	fell	down	ten	 meter 	 s 	 	.
so	one	year	ago	,	the	us	 militar 	 y 	 	did	n't	have	these	 robot 	 s 	 	.
now	they	're	on	active	duty	in	afghanistan	every	day	.
and	that	's	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	they	say	a	robot	invasion	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	a	sea	change	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	how	--	where	technology	's	going	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
and	over	the	next	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	be	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	in	production	down	producing	oil	 well 	 s 	 	to	get	that	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	of	oil	out	of	the	ground	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	,	150Ëš	c	,	10,000	psi	.
autonomous	 robot 	 s 	 	going	down	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	work	.
but	 robot 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	're	a	little	hard	to	program	.
how	,	in	the	future	,	are	we	going	to	program	our	 robot 	 s 	 	and	make	them	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	use	?
and	i	want	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	a	robot	here	--	a	robot	named	chris	--	stand	up	.	 yea 	 h 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
come	over	here	.	now	notice	,	he	 think 	 s 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	have	to	be	a	bit	stiff	.
he	sort	of	 do 	 es 	 	that	.	but	i	'm	going	to	--	chris	anderson	:	i	'm	just	british	.	rb	:	oh	.
i	'm	going	to	show	 th 	 is 	 	robot	a	task	.	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	task	.
now	notice	,	he	 nod 	 d 	 ed 	 	there	,	he	was	giving	me	some	 indic 	 ation 	 	he	was	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	flow	of	communication	.
and	if	i	'd	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	bizarre	he	would	have	 look 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ance 	 	at	me	,	and	 regulat 	 ed 	 	the	conversation	.
so	now	i	 br 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	up	in	front	of	him	.
i	'd	 look 	 ed 	 	at	his	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	i	saw	his	 eye 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	bottle	top	.
and	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	task	here	,	and	he	's	 check 	 ing 	 	up	.
his	 eye 	 s 	 	are	going	back	and	forth	up	to	me	,	to	see	what	i	'm	looking	at	--	so	we	've	got	 share 	 d 	 	attention	.
and	so	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	task	,	and	he	 look 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 look 	 s 	 	to	me	to	see	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	next	.	and	now	i	'll	give	him	the	bottle	,	and	we	'll	see	if	he	can	do	the	task	.	can	you	do	that	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	he	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.	 yea 	 h 	 	.	good	,	good	,	good	.
i	did	n't	show	you	how	to	do	that	.
now	see	if	you	can	put	it	back	together	.
and	he	 think 	 s 	 	a	robot	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 low 	 	.
good	robot	,	that	's	good	.
so	we	saw	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	there	.
we	saw	when	we	're	 interact 	 ing 	 	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	show	 some 	 one 	 	how	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	we	direct	 the 	 ir 	 	visual	attention	.
the	other	thing	 communicate 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	internal	state	to	us	,	 whet 	 her 	 	he	's	 understand 	 ing 	 	or	not	,	 regulat 	 es 	 	a	social	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
there	was	 share 	 d 	 	attention	looking	at	the	same	sort	of	thing	,	and	 recogn 	 izing 	 	 social 	 ly 	 	 communicate 	 d 	 	 reinforce 	 ment 	 	at	the	end	.
and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	that	 in 	 to 	 	our	lab	 robot 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	're	going	to	want	to	interact	with	 robot 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
i	just	want	to	show	you	one	technical	 dia 	 gram 	 	here	.
the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	for	building	a	robot	that	you	can	interact	with	 social 	 ly 	 	is	 it 	 s 	 	visual	attention	system	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	it	 pay 	 s 	 	attention	to	is	what	it	's	 see 	 ing 	 	and	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	,	and	what	you	're	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	in	the	 video 	 s 	 	i	'm	about	to	show	you	,	you	're	going	to	see	a	visual	attention	system	on	a	robot	which	 ha 	 s 	 	--	it	 look 	 s 	 	for	skin	tone	in	hsv	space	,	so	it	 work 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	all	human	 color 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	for	 high 	 ly 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	 color 	 s 	 	,	from	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 look 	 s 	 	for	 thing 	 s 	 	that	move	around	.
and	it	 weight 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	together	 in 	 to 	 	an	attention	window	,	and	it	 look 	 s 	 	for	the	highest	-	 s 	 cor 	 ing 	 	place	--	the	stuff	where	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	stuff	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	--	and	that	is	what	 it 	 s 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	then	segue	to	.
and	it	 look 	 s 	 	right	at	that	.
at	the	same	time	,	some	top	-	down	sort	of	stuff	:	might	decide	that	it	's	 lone 	 ly 	 	and	look	for	skin	tone	,	or	might	decide	that	it	's	 bor 	 ed 	 	and	look	for	a	 to 	 y 	 	to	play	with	.
and	so	these	 weight 	 s 	 	change	.
and	over	here	on	the	right	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	call	the	steven	spielberg	memorial	 modul 	 e 	 	.
did	people	see	the	movie	``	ai	``	?
rb	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	,	but	--	remember	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	haley	joel	osment	,	the	little	robot	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	blue	 fair 	 y 	 	for	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	taking	his	 eye 	 s 	 	off	it	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	 get 	 s 	 	rid	of	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 habitu 	 ation 	 	gaussian	that	 get 	 s 	 	negative	,	and	more	and	more	 intens 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	at	one	thing	.
and	it	 get 	 s 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	,	so	it	will	then	look	away	at	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
so	,	once	you	've	got	that	--	and	here	's	a	robot	,	here	's	kismet	,	looking	around	for	a	 to 	 y 	 	.	you	can	tell	what	it	's	looking	at	.
you	can	estimate	 it 	 s 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	direction	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 eye 	 ball 	 s 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	camera	,	and	you	can	tell	when	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 to 	 y 	 	.
and	it	's	got	a	little	bit	of	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	here	.
but	it	's	still	going	to	pay	attention	if	 some 	 thing 	 	more	significant	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	field	of	view	--	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	cynthia	breazeal	,	the	 build 	 er 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	robot	,	from	the	right	.
it	 s 	 ees 	 	her	,	 pay 	 s 	 	attention	to	her	.
kismet	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	,	three	-	dimensional	 emotion 	 al 	 	space	,	a	vector	space	,	of	where	it	is	 emotion 	 ally 	 	.
and	at	different	 place 	 s 	 	in	that	space	,	it	 express 	 es 	 	--	can	we	have	the	volume	on	here	?
can	you	hear	that	now	,	out	there	?
kismet	:	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	think	so	?	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	think	so	?
do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	think	so	?
rb	:	so	it	's	 express 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	emotion	through	 it 	 s 	 	face	and	the	 pro 	 so 	 dy 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	voice	.
and	when	i	was	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	my	robot	over	here	,	chris	,	the	robot	,	was	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	 pro 	 so 	 dy 	 	in	my	voice	,	and	so	we	have	the	robot	measure	 pro 	 so 	 dy 	 	for	four	 bas 	 ic 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	that	 mother 	 s 	 	give	 the 	 ir 	 	children	pre	-	 linguist 	 ically 	 	.
here	we	've	got	naive	 subject 	 s 	 	 p 	 raising 	 	the	robot	:	voice	:	nice	robot	.
you	're	 s 	 uch 	 	a	cute	little	robot	.
rb	:	and	the	robot	's	 react 	 ing 	 	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	.
voice	:	...	 ver 	 y 	 	good	,	kismet	.
voice	:	look	at	my	 s 	 mile 	 	.
rb	:	it	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	.	she	 imit 	 ates 	 	the	 s 	 mile 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
these	are	naive	 subject 	 s 	 	.
here	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	get	the	robot	's	attention	and	 indic 	 ate 	 	when	they	have	the	robot	's	attention	.
voice	:	 he 	 y 	 	,	kismet	,	ah	,	there	it	is	.
rb	:	so	she	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	she	 ha 	 s 	 	the	robot	's	attention	.
voice	:	kismet	,	do	you	like	the	 to 	 y 	 	?	oh	.
rb	:	now	,	here	they	're	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	prohibit	the	robot	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	first	woman	 re 	 ally 	 	 push 	 es 	 	the	robot	 in 	 to 	 	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	corner	.
voice	:	no	.	no	.	you	're	not	to	do	that	.	no	.
not	appropriate	.	no	.	no	.
rb	:	i	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	it	at	that	.
we	put	that	together	.	then	we	put	in	turn	taking	.
when	we	talk	to	 some 	 one 	 	,	we	talk	.
then	we	sort	of	raise	our	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	,	move	our	 eye 	 s 	 	,	give	the	other	person	the	idea	it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	turn	to	talk	.
and	then	they	talk	,	and	then	we	pass	the	 ba 	 ton 	 	back	and	forth	between	each	other	.
so	we	put	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	robot	.
we	got	a	bunch	of	naive	 subject 	 s 	 	in	,	we	did	n't	tell	them	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	robot	,	 s 	 at 	 	them	down	in	front	of	the	robot	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	talk	to	the	robot	.
now	what	they	did	n't	know	was	,	the	robot	was	n't	 understand 	 ing 	 	a	word	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	that	the	robot	was	n't	 s 	 peaking 	 	english	.
it	was	just	 say 	 ing 	 	random	english	 phone 	 me 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	you	to	watch	 care 	 fully 	 	,	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	 th 	 is 	 	person	,	ritchie	,	who	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	talk	to	the	robot	for	25	 minute 	 s 	 	--	--	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	want	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.
i	want	to	show	you	my	watch	.	``
and	he	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	watch	center	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	robot	's	field	of	vision	,	 point 	 s 	 	to	it	,	 give 	 s 	 	it	a	motion	cue	,	and	the	robot	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	watch	 quit 	 e 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	.
we	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	he	 under 	 stood 	 	or	not	that	the	robot	--	notice	the	turn	-	taking	.
ritchie	:	ok	,	i	want	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.	ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	watch	that	my	girlfriend	 g 	 ave 	 	me	.
robot	:	oh	,	cool	.
ritchie	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	look	,	it	's	got	a	little	blue	light	in	it	too	.	i	 al 	 most 	 	lost	it	 th 	 is 	 	week	.
rb	:	so	it	's	making	eye	contact	with	him	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	his	 eye 	 s 	 	.
ritchie	:	can	you	do	the	same	thing	?	robot	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 	.
rb	:	and	they	 success 	 fully 	 	have	that	sort	of	communication	.
and	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	chris	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	robot	,	cog	.
they	first	make	eye	contact	,	and	then	,	when	christie	 look 	 s 	 	over	at	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 y 	 	,	the	robot	 estimate 	 s 	 	her	 gaz 	 e 	 	direction	and	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	same	thing	that	she	's	looking	at	.
so	we	're	going	to	see	more	and	more	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	robot	over	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	in	 lab 	 s 	 	.
but	then	the	big	 question 	 s 	 	,	two	big	 question 	 s 	 	that	people	ask	me	are	:	if	we	make	these	 robot 	 s 	 	more	and	more	human	-	like	,	will	we	accept	them	,	will	we	--	will	they	need	 right 	 s 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	?
and	the	other	question	people	ask	me	is	,	will	they	want	to	take	over	?
and	on	the	first	--	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hollywood	theme	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 movie 	 s 	 	.	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	these	 character 	 s 	 	here	--	where	in	each	of	these	 case 	 s 	 	,	the	 robot 	 s 	 	want	more	respect	.
well	,	do	you	ever	need	to	give	 robot 	 s 	 	respect	?
they	're	just	 machine 	 s 	 	,	after	all	.
but	i	think	,	you	know	,	we	have	to	accept	that	we	are	just	 machine 	 s 	 	.
after	all	,	that	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	what	modern	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	 say 	 s 	 	about	us	.
you	do	n't	see	a	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	how	,	you	know	,	molecule	a	,	you	know	,	 come 	 s 	 	up	and	 dock 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	other	molecule	.
and	it	's	moving	forward	,	you	know	,	 propel 	 led 	 	by	 vari 	 ous 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	soul	 step 	 s 	 	in	and	 tweak 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	so	that	they	connect	.
it	's	all	 mechan 	 istic 	 	.	we	are	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
if	we	are	 machine 	 s 	 	,	then	in	principle	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	we	should	be	able	to	build	 machine 	 s 	 	out	of	other	stuff	,	which	are	just	 a 	 s 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	.
but	i	think	for	us	to	admit	that	,	we	have	to	give	up	on	our	special	-	ness	,	in	a	certain	way	.
and	we	've	had	the	 re 	 treat 	 	from	special	-	ness	under	the	 bar 	 rage 	 	of	science	and	technology	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	over	the	last	few	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	.
500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	that	we	are	the	center	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	when	the	earth	 start 	 ed 	 	to	go	around	the	 s 	 un 	 	;	150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	with	darwin	,	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	we	 we 	 re 	 	different	from	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	to	imagine	--	you	know	,	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	hard	for	us	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 batt 	 er 	 ed 	 	with	the	idea	that	 may 	 be 	 	we	did	n't	even	have	our	own	creation	event	,	here	on	earth	,	which	people	did	n't	like	much	.	and	then	the	human	genome	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	35,000	 gene 	 s 	 	.	and	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	--	people	did	n't	like	that	,	we	've	got	more	 gene 	 s 	 	than	that	.
we	do	n't	like	to	give	up	our	special	-	ness	,	so	,	you	know	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	idea	that	 robot 	 s 	 	could	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	or	that	 robot 	 s 	 	could	be	living	 creature 	 s 	 	--	i	think	is	going	to	be	hard	for	us	to	accept	.
but	we	're	going	to	come	to	accept	it	over	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	.
and	the	second	question	is	,	will	the	 machine 	 s 	 	want	to	take	over	?
and	here	the	standard	scenario	is	that	we	create	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	grow	,	we	nurture	them	,	they	learn	a	lot	from	us	,	and	then	they	start	to	decide	that	we	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	 s 	 low 	 	.
they	want	to	take	over	from	us	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	that	have	 teenager 	 s 	 	,	you	know	what	that	's	like	.
but	hollywood	 extend 	 s 	 	it	to	the	 robot 	 s 	 	.
and	the	question	is	,	you	know	,	will	 some 	 one 	 	 accident 	 ally 	 	build	a	robot	that	 take 	 s 	 	over	from	us	?
and	that	's	sort	of	like	 th 	 is 	 	lone	guy	in	the	 back 	 yard 	 	,	you	know	--	``	i	 accident 	 ally 	 	built	a	747.	``
i	do	n't	think	that	's	going	to	happen	.
and	i	do	n't	think	--	--	i	do	n't	think	we	're	going	to	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	build	 robot 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	.
we	'll	--	you	know	,	they	're	not	going	to	have	a	super	bad	robot	.
before	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	come	to	be	a	 mild 	 ly 	 	bad	robot	,	and	before	that	a	not	so	bad	robot	.
and	we	're	just	not	going	to	let	it	go	that	way	.
so	,	i	think	i	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	it	at	that	:	the	 robot 	 s 	 	are	coming	,	we	do	n't	have	too	much	to	worry	about	,	it	's	going	to	be	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	i	hope	you	all	enjoy	the	journey	over	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
