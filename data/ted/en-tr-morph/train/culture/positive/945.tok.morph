the	 on 	 ly 	 	phase	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	that	can	support	 human 	 ity 	 	.
the	trouble	is	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	a	quadruple	sqeeze	on	 th 	 is 	 	poor	planet	,	a	quadruple	sqeeze	,	which	,	 a 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	first	 squeez 	 e 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	population	growth	of	course	.

the	second	pressure	on	the	planet	is	,	of	course	the	climate	agenda	--	the	big	issue	--	where	the	policy	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	science	is	that	it	would	be	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 stabil 	 ize 	 	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	at	450	ppm	to	avoid	average	 temperature 	 s 	 	 exceed 	 ing 	 	two	 degree 	 s 	 	,	to	avoid	the	risk	that	we	may	be	 de 	 stabil 	 izing 	 	the	west	antarctic	ice	sheet	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	six	 meter 	 s 	 	--	level	 ris 	 ing 	 	,	the	risk	of	 de 	 stabil 	 izing 	 	the	greenland	ice	sheet	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	seven	 meter 	 s 	 	--	sea	level	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	you	would	have	 wish 	 ed 	 	the	climate	pressure	to	hit	a	strong	planet	,	a	 resili 	 ent 	 	planet	,	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	third	pressure	is	the	 eco 	 system 	 	decline	.

the	forth	pressure	is	surprise	,	the	 not 	 ion 	 	and	the	evidence	that	we	need	to	abandon	our	old	paradigm	,	that	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	 behav 	 e 	 	 linear 	 ly 	 	,	 predict 	 ably 	 	,	 controll 	 ably 	 	in	our	--	so	to	say	--	linear	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	that	in	fact	,	surprise	is	universal	,	 a 	 s 	 	 system 	 s 	 	tip	over	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	 abrupt 	 ly 	 	and	often	 ir 	 revers 	 ibly 	 	.

now	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	what	's	the	evidence	for	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	the	evidence	is	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	ample	.
it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 hoc 	 key 	 	stick	pattern	of	 accele 	 rated 	 	change	.

you	see	,	for	the	first	time	,	an	 im 	 print 	 	on	the	global	level	.
and	i	can	tell	you	,	you	enter	the	disciplinary	research	in	each	of	these	,	you	find	 some 	 thing 	 	 remark 	 ably 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	we	may	have	come	to	the	point	where	we	have	to	bend	the	 curv 	 es 	 	,	that	we	may	have	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	most	 challeng 	 ing 	 	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	decade	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	on	the	planet	,	the	decade	when	we	have	to	bend	the	 curv 	 es 	 	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	 en 	 ough 	 	--	to	just	bend	the	 curv 	 es 	 	and	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	 accele 	 rated 	 	pressure	on	the	planet	--	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	fact	that	 system 	 s 	 	do	have	 multi 	 ple 	 	 s 	 table 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 separat 	 ed 	 	by	 threshold 	 s 	 	--	 illustr 	 ated 	 	here	by	 th 	 is 	 	ball	and	cup	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	where	the	depth	of	the	cup	is	the	 resili 	 ence 	 	of	the	system	.
now	,	the	system	may	 gradu 	 ally 	 	--	under	pressure	of	climate	change	,	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	loss	--	lose	the	depth	of	the	cup	,	the	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	but	appear	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	and	appear	to	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	under	a	threshold	,	be	 tip 	 ping 	 	over	.	upff	.

the	 arc 	 tic 	 	--	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	system	--	a	 regulat 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 me 	 	at	the	planetary	level	,	taking	the	knock	after	knock	on	climate	change	,	 appear 	 ing 	 	to	be	in	a	good	state	.

and	the	drama	is	,	of	course	,	that	when	the	system	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	logic	may	change	.
it	may	get	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	an	 un 	 desir 	 ed 	 	state	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 change 	 s 	 	color	,	 absorb 	 s 	 	more	energy	,	and	the	system	may	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	.

 a 	 s 	 	a	 side 	 line 	 	,	you	know	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	red	flag	that	 pop 	 ped 	 	up	here	was	a	 sub 	 marine 	 	from	an	 un 	 named 	 	country	that	 plant 	 ed 	 	a	red	flag	at	the	bottom	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	to	be	able	to	control	the	oil	 resource 	 s 	 	.
now	,	if	we	have	evidence	,	which	we	now	have	,	that	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	,	 forest 	 s 	 	,	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	monsoon	system	,	the	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	,	 behav 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 non 	 linear 	 	way	.
30	or	so	 scientist 	 s 	 	around	the	world	 gather 	 ed 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	question	for	the	first	time	,	``	do	we	have	to	put	the	planet	 in 	 to 	 	the	the	pot	?	``
so	we	have	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	:	are	we	 threaten 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 s 	 table 	 	holocene	state	?
are	we	in	fact	 put 	 ting 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	we	're	coming	too	close	to	 threshold 	 s 	 	that	could	lead	to	 delet 	 er 	 ious 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 desir 	 ed 	 	,	if	now	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	,	change	for	human	 develop 	 ment 	 	?
you	know	,	you	do	n't	want	to	stand	there	.
in	fact	,	you	're	not	even	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	stand	where	 th 	 is 	 	 gentle 	 man 	 	is	 stand 	 ing 	 	,	at	the	 foam 	 ing 	 	,	 slip 	 per 	 y 	 	 water 	 s 	 	at	the	threshold	.
in	fact	,	there	's	a	 f 	 ence 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 up 	 stream 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	threshold	,	beyond	which	you	are	in	a	danger	zone	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	paradigm	,	which	we	 gather 	 ed 	 	two	,	three	 year 	 s 	 	back	,	 recogn 	 izing 	 	that	our	old	paradigm	of	just	 analyz 	 ing 	 	and	 push 	 ing 	 	and	 predict 	 ing 	 	 parameter 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,	 aim 	 ing 	 	at	 minimal 	 izing 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	,	is	of	the	past	.
now	we	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	:	which	are	the	large	 environment 	 al 	 	 process 	 es 	 	that	we	have	to	be	 steward 	 s 	 	of	to	keep	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	safe	in	the	holocene	?
and	could	we	even	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	major	 advance 	 ments 	 	in	earth	 system 	 s 	 	science	,	identify	the	 threshold 	 s 	 	,	the	 point 	 s 	 	where	we	may	expect	 non 	 linear 	 	change	?
and	could	we	even	define	a	planetary	 bound 	 ary 	 	,	a	 f 	 ence 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	which	we	then	have	a	safe	 oper 	 ating 	 	space	for	 human 	 ity 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	work	,	which	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	``	nature	,	``	late	2009	,	after	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	analysis	,	led	to	the	final	 pro 	 position 	 	that	we	can	 on 	 ly 	 	find	nine	planetary	 bound 	 aries 	 	with	which	,	under	active	 steward 	 ship 	 	,	would	allow	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	have	a	safe	 oper 	 ating 	 	space	.
these	include	,	of	course	,	climate	.
it	may	surprise	you	that	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	climate	.
but	it	 show 	 s 	 	that	we	are	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	,	among	 man 	 y 	 	 system 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	,	with	the	three	big	 system 	 s 	 	,	climate	change	,	 strato 	 spheric 	 	 o 	 zone 	 	 deple 	 tion 	 	and	ocean	 acid 	 ification 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	three	big	 system 	 s 	 	,	where	the	scientific	evidence	of	large	-	scale	 threshold 	 s 	 	in	the	paleo	-	record	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	planet	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	include	,	what	we	call	,	the	 s 	 low 	 	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	,	the	 system 	 s 	 	that	,	under	the	hood	,	 regulat 	 e 	 	and	 buff 	 er 	 	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	the	 resili 	 ence 	 	of	the	planet	--	the	 inter 	 ference 	 	of	the	big	nitrogen	and	 phosphor 	 us 	 	 cycle 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	,	land	use	change	,	rate	of	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	loss	,	 fresh 	 water 	 	use	,	 function 	 s 	 	which	 regulat 	 e 	 	 bio 	 mass 	 	on	the	planet	,	carbon	 sequest 	 ration 	 	,	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
and	then	we	have	two	 parameter 	 s 	 	which	we	 we 	 re 	 	not	able	to	 quant 	 ify 	 	--	air	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 warm 	 ing 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	and	air	-	polluting	 s 	 ul 	 fate 	 s 	 	and	 nitr 	 ates 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	chemical	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
together	,	these	form	an	 integrate 	 d 	 	whole	for	 gui 	 d 	 ing 	 	human	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	the	anthropocene	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	the	planet	is	a	complex	self	-	 regulat 	 ing 	 	system	.
in	fact	,	most	evidence	 indic 	 ates 	 	that	these	nine	may	 behav 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	three	musketeers	,	``	one	for	all	.	all	for	one	.	``
you	 de 	 grade 	 	 forest 	 s 	 	,	you	go	beyond	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	on	land	,	you	 under 	 mine 	 	the	ability	of	the	climate	system	to	stay	 s 	 table 	 	.
the	drama	here	is	,	in	fact	,	that	it	may	show	that	the	climate	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	the	easy	one	,	if	you	consider	the	whole	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	 sustain 	 able 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	big	bang	 equi 	 valent 	 	then	of	human	 develop 	 ment 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	safe	 oper 	 ating 	 	space	of	the	planetary	 bound 	 aries 	 	.
what	you	see	here	in	black	line	is	the	safe	 oper 	 ating 	 	space	,	the	 quant 	 ified 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 suggest 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	analysis	.
the	yellow	dot	in	the	middle	here	is	our	 start 	 ing 	 	point	,	the	pre	-	industrial	point	,	where	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 safe 	 ly 	 	in	the	safe	 oper 	 ating 	 	space	.
in	the	'50s	,	we	start	 branch 	 ing 	 	out	.
in	the	'60s	 al 	 ready 	 	,	through	the	green	revolution	and	the	haber	-	bosch	process	of	 fix 	 ing 	 	nitrogen	from	the	atmosphere	--	you	know	,	human	's	 to 	 day 	 	take	out	more	nitrogen	from	the	atmosphere	than	the	whole	 bio 	 sphere 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	.
we	do	n't	transgress	the	climate	 bound 	 ary 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	early	'90s	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	right	after	rio	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	are	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	we	estimate	that	we	've	 transgress 	 ed 	 	three	 bound 	 aries 	 	,	the	rate	of	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	loss	,	which	is	the	sixth	 extinct 	 ion 	 	period	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	--	one	of	them	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 extinct 	 ions 	 	of	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	--	nitrogen	and	climate	change	.
but	we	still	have	some	 degree 	 s 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	on	the	 other 	 s 	 	,	but	we	are	 approach 	 ing 	 	fast	on	land	,	water	,	 phosphor 	 us 	 	and	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	a	new	paradigm	to	guide	 human 	 ity 	 	,	to	put	the	light	on	our	,	so	far	 over 	 powered 	 	industrial	vehicle	,	which	 oper 	 ates 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	on	a	dark	,	straight	 high 	 way 	 	.
now	the	question	then	is	:	how	 gloom 	 y 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
is	then	 sustain 	 able 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	utopia	?
well	,	there	's	no	science	to	suggest	.
in	fact	,	there	is	ample	science	to	 indic 	 ate 	 	that	we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	 transform 	 ative 	 	change	,	that	we	have	the	ability	to	now	move	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	a	 transform 	 ative 	 	gear	,	 a 	 cross 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	.
the	drama	is	,	of	course	,	is	that	200	 count 	 ries 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	have	to	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	start	moving	in	the	same	direction	.
but	it	 change 	 s 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	our	 govern 	 ance 	 	and	management	paradigm	,	from	the	current	linear	,	command	and	control	 think 	 ing 	 	,	looking	at	efficiencies	and	 optim 	 ization 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	much	more	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	a	much	more	 adapt 	 ive 	 	approach	,	where	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ancy 	 	,	both	in	social	and	 environment 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	is	key	to	be	able	to	deal	with	a	 turbul 	 ent 	 	era	of	global	change	.
we	have	to	invest	in	 persist 	 ence 	 	,	in	the	ability	of	social	 system 	 s 	 	and	 eco 	 logical 	 	 system 	 s 	 	to	 with 	 stand 	 	 shock 	 s 	 	and	still	remain	in	that	 desir 	 ed 	 	cup	.
we	have	to	invest	in	 transform 	 ations 	 	 cap 	 ability 	 	,	moving	from	crisis	 in 	 to 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	the	ability	to	rise	after	a	crisis	,	and	of	course	to	adapt	to	 un 	 avoid 	 able 	 	change	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	paradigm	.
we	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	that	at	any	scale	on	 govern 	 ance 	 	.
but	is	it	 happen 	 ing 	 	 any 	 where 	 	?
do	we	have	any	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	success	on	 th 	 is 	 	mind	shift	 be 	 ing 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	at	the	local	level	?
well	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	in	fact	we	do	and	the	list	can	start	 be 	 coming 	 	 long 	 er 	 	and	 long 	 er 	 	.
there	's	good	news	here	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	from	latin	america	,	where	plow	-	based	 farm 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	of	the	'50s	and	'60s	led	 farm 	 ing 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	to	a	dead	-	end	,	with	lower	and	lower	 yield 	 s 	 	,	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	matter	and	fundamental	 problem 	 s 	 	at	the	livelihood	 level 	 s 	 	in	paraguay	,	uruguay	and	a	number	of	 count 	 ries 	 	,	brazil	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	among	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	 scientist 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 agricultur 	 al 	 	revolution	of	zero	 till 	 age 	 	 system 	 s 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	with	mulch	 farm 	 ing 	 	with	 local 	 ly 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	which	 to 	 day 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	some	 count 	 ries 	 	,	have	led	to	a	tremendous	 in 	 crease 	 	in	area	under	mulch	,	zero	till	 farm 	 ing 	 	which	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 produce 	 s 	 	more	food	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 sequest 	 ers 	 	carbon	.
the	australian	great	 bar 	 rier 	 	reef	is	 an 	 other 	 	success	story	.

but	the	window	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	was	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	new	 mind 	 set 	 	,	which	 to 	 day 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	 govern 	 ance 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	to	build	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ancy 	 	and	invest	in	the	whole	system	 a 	 s 	 	an	 integrate 	 d 	 	whole	,	and	then	allow	for	much	more	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ancy 	 	in	the	system	.
sweden	,	the	country	i	come	from	,	 ha 	 s 	 	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	where	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	in	southern	sweden	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	flood	-	prone	 pollute 	 d 	 	 nuis 	 ance 	 	in	the	peri	-	urban	 region 	 s 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	crisis	,	new	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	 act 	 ors 	 	 local 	 ly 	 	,	 transform 	 ing 	 	these	 in 	 to 	 	a	key	component	of	 sustain 	 able 	 	urban	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
so	crisis	 lead 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
now	,	what	about	the	future	?
well	,	the	future	,	of	course	,	 ha 	 s 	 	one	massive	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	which	is	 feed 	 ing 	 	a	world	of	nine	billion	people	.
we	need	 noth 	 ing 	 	less	than	a	new	green	revolution	,	and	the	planet	 bound 	 aries 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	go	from	a	source	of	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	to	a	sink	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	on	current	land	.
we	can	not	expand	 any 	 more 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 erode 	 s 	 	the	planetary	 bound 	 aries 	 	.
we	can	not	 continu 	 e 	 	 consum 	 ing 	 	water	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	 to 	 day 	 	,	with	25	percent	of	world	 river 	 s 	 	not	even	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	ocean	.
and	we	need	a	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
well	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	and	based	on	my	work	and	 other 	 s 	 	in	africa	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	've	 show 	 n 	 	that	even	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	small	-	scale	 rain 	 fall 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	with	 innov 	 ations 	 	and	 supplement 	 ary 	 	 irrig 	 ation 	 	to	bridge	dry	 spell 	 s 	 	and	 drought 	 s 	 	,	 sustain 	 able 	 	 sanit 	 ation 	 	 system 	 s 	 	to	close	the	loop	on	 nutrient 	 s 	 	from	 toilet 	 s 	 	back	to	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	 field 	 s 	 	,	and	 innov 	 ations 	 	in	 till 	 age 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	we	can	triple	,	quadruple	,	yield	 level 	 s 	 	on	current	land	.
elinor	ostrom	,	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 no 	 bel 	 	laureate	of	 economic 	 s 	 	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	 show 	 s 	 	 empir 	 ically 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	that	we	can	govern	the	 common 	 s 	 	if	we	invest	in	trust	,	local	,	action	-	based	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	and	cross	-	scale	 institution 	 al 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	,	where	local	 act 	 ors 	 	,	together	,	can	deal	with	the	global	 common 	 s 	 	at	a	large	scale	.
but	even	on	the	hard	policy	area	we	have	 innov 	 ations 	 	.
we	know	that	we	have	to	move	from	our	fossil	 depend 	 ence 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	low	-	carbon	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	record	time	.
and	what	 s 	 hall 	 	we	do	?
 every 	 body 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	about	carbon	 tax 	 es 	 	--	it	wo	n't	work	--	 e 	 mission 	 	 scheme 	 s 	 	,	but	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	one	policy	measure	,	feed	-	in	 ta 	 riff 	 s 	 	on	the	energy	system	,	which	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	,	from	 chin 	 a 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	on	 off 	 shore 	 	wind	 system 	 s 	 	,	all	the	way	to	the	u.s	.
where	you	give	the	 guarantee 	 d 	 	price	for	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	,	but	you	can	subsidize	 electric 	 ity 	 	to	poor	people	.
you	get	people	out	of	poverty	.
you	solve	the	climate	issue	with	 regard 	 s 	 	to	the	energy	sector	,	while	at	the	same	time	,	 stimul 	 ating 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	--	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	be	out	 scale 	 d 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	at	the	planetary	level	.
so	there	is	--	no	doubt	--	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	here	,	and	we	can	list	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 transform 	 ative 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	around	the	planet	.
the	key	 th 	 ough 	 	in	all	of	these	,	the	red	 th 	 read 	 	,	is	the	shift	in	 mind 	 set 	 	,	moving	away	from	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	are	 push 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	dark	future	,	where	we	 in 	 stead 	 	 back 	 cast 	 	our	future	,	and	we	say	,	``	what	is	the	 play 	 ing 	 	field	on	the	planet	?
what	are	the	planetary	 bound 	 aries 	 	 with 	 in 	 	which	we	can	 safe 	 ly 	 	 oper 	 ate 	 	?	``
and	then	 back 	 track 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	 with 	 in 	 	that	.
but	of	course	,	the	drama	is	,	it	 clear 	 ly 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	 increment 	 al 	 	change	is	not	an	option	.
so	,	there	is	scientific	evidence	.
they	sort	of	say	the	harsh	news	,	that	we	are	facing	the	largest	 transform 	 ative 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	since	the	 industrial 	 ization 	 	.
in	fact	,	what	we	have	to	do	over	the	next	40	 year 	 s 	 	is	much	more	 dramat 	 ic 	 	and	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	than	what	we	did	when	we	 move 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	we	're	in	 to 	 day 	 	.
now	,	science	 indic 	 ates 	 	that	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	a	 prosper 	 ous 	 	future	 with 	 in 	 	the	safe	 oper 	 ating 	 	space	,	 collabor 	 ating 	 	on	a	global	level	,	from	local	to	global	scale	,	in	 transform 	 ative 	 	 option 	 s 	 	,	which	build	 resili 	 ence 	 	on	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	planet	.
