 restaurant 	 s 	 	and	the	food	industry	in	general	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	most	 waste 	 ful 	 	industry	in	the	world	.
for	every	calorie	of	food	that	we	 consum 	 e 	 	here	in	britain	 to 	 day 	 	,	10	 calorie 	 s 	 	are	taken	to	produce	it	.
that	's	a	lot	.
i	want	to	take	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	humble	to	discuss	.
i	found	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	market	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	if	 any 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	take	it	home	and	mash	it	 lat 	 er 	 	,	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	welcome	to	.
the	humble	potato	--	and	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	a	long	time	,	25	 year 	 s 	 	,	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	these	.
and	it	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 go 	 es 	 	through	eight	different	 form 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 life 	 time 	 	.
first	of	all	,	it	's	 plant 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	 take 	 s 	 	energy	.
it	 grow 	 s 	 	and	is	 nurture 	 d 	 	.
it	's	then	 harvest 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	then	 distribut 	 ed 	 	,	and	 distribut 	 ion 	 	is	a	massive	issue	.
it	's	then	 s 	 old 	 	and	 b 	 ought 	 	,	and	it	's	then	 deliver 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
i	 bas 	 ically 	 	take	it	,	 prep 	 are 	 	it	,	and	then	people	 consum 	 e 	 	it	--	 hope 	 fully 	 	they	enjoy	it	.
the	last	stage	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	waste	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	where	 every 	 body 	 	 dis 	 regard 	 s 	 	it	.
there	are	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	waste	.
there	's	a	waste	of	time	;	there	's	a	waste	of	space	;	there	's	a	waste	of	energy	;	and	there	's	a	waste	of	waste	.
and	every	business	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	over	the	past	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	lower	each	one	of	these	 element 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	you	ask	what	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	restaurant	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	a	restaurant	just	like	any	other	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	restaurant	,	 a 	 corn 	 	house	.
front	and	back	.
so	let	me	run	you	through	a	few	 idea 	 s 	 	.
floor	:	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	 recycl 	 able 	 	.
 chair 	 s 	 	:	 recycl 	 ed 	 	and	 recycl 	 able 	 	.
 table 	 s 	 	:	 forest 	 ry 	 	commission	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	norwegian	 forest 	 ry 	 	commission	wood	.
 th 	 is 	 	bench	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	for	my	mom	--	she	did	n't	like	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	it	,	so	she	went	and	 b 	 ought 	 	these	 cushion 	 s 	 	for	me	from	a	local	jumble	sale	--	 re 	 using 	 	,	a	job	that	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
i	hate	waste	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	.
if	they	're	not	 work 	 ing 	 	,	put	a	shelf	on	it	,	which	i	did	,	and	that	 show 	 s 	 	all	the	 custom 	 ers 	 	my	 product 	 s 	 	.
the	whole	business	is	run	on	 sustain 	 able 	 	energy	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	powered	by	wind	.	all	of	the	 light 	 s 	 	are	 day 	 light 	 	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
paint	is	all	low	-	volume	chemical	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	when	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	room	all	the	time	.
i	was	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	these	--	i	do	n't	know	if	you	can	see	it	--	but	there	's	a	work	surface	there	.
and	that	's	a	plastic	polymer	.
and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	well	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	think	nature	,	nature	,	nature	.
but	i	thought	,	no	,	no	,	experiment	with	 re 	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	,	experiment	with	 polymer 	 s 	 	.
will	they	 out 	 live 	 	me	?	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	might	.
right	,	here	's	a	 re 	 condition 	 ed 	 	coffee	machine	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	better	than	a	brand	new	one	--	so	looking	good	there	.
now	 re 	 using 	 	is	vital	.
and	we	filter	our	own	water	.
we	put	them	in	 bottle 	 s 	 	,	 refrige 	 rate 	 	them	,	and	then	we	 re 	 use 	 	that	bottle	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
here	's	a	great	little	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
if	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 o 	 range 	 	tree	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	growing	in	a	car	tire	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	out	and	 sew 	 n 	 	up	.
it	's	got	my	 com 	 post 	 	in	it	,	which	is	growing	an	 o 	 range 	 	tree	,	which	is	great	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kitchen	,	which	is	in	the	same	room	.
i	 bas 	 ically 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	menu	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	people	to	 choos 	 e 	 	the	amount	and	volume	of	food	that	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 consum 	 e 	 	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	me	 put 	 ting 	 	a	dish	down	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	help	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	much	or	 a 	 s 	 	little	 a 	 s 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	it	's	a	small	kitchen	.	it	's	about	five	square	 meter 	 s 	 	.
it	 serve 	 s 	 	220	people	a	day	.
we	generate	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	waste	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	waste	room	.
you	ca	n't	get	rid	of	waste	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	story	's	not	about	 elimi 	 nating 	 	it	,	it	's	about	 minim 	 izing 	 	it	.
in	here	,	i	have	produce	and	boxes	that	are	 un 	 avoid 	 able 	 	.
i	put	my	food	waste	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 hyd 	 rating 	 	,	 de 	 s 	 ic 	 cat 	 ing 	 	 mac 	 er 	 ator 	 	--	 turn 	 s 	 	food	 in 	 to 	 	an	inner	material	,	which	i	can	store	and	then	 com 	 post 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
i	 com 	 post 	 	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	garden	.
all	of	the	 s 	 oil 	 	you	can	see	there	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	my	food	,	which	is	generated	by	the	restaurant	,	and	it	's	growing	in	these	 tub 	 s 	 	,	which	i	made	out	of	storm	-	felled	 tree 	 s 	 	and	wine	 cask 	 s 	 	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
three	 com 	 post 	 	 bin 	 s 	 	--	go	through	about	70	 kilo 	 s 	 	of	raw	 veget 	 able 	 	waste	a	week	--	 re 	 ally 	 	good	,	 make 	 s 	 	fantastic	 com 	 post 	 	.
a	couple	of	 worm 	 eries 	 	in	there	too	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 worm 	 eries 	 	was	a	big	 worm 	 ery 	 	.	i	had	a	lot	of	 worm 	 s 	 	in	it	.
and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	taking	the	dried	food	waste	,	 put 	 ting 	 	it	to	the	 worm 	 s 	 	,	going	,	``	there	you	go	,	 d 	 inner 	 	.	``
it	was	like	 veget 	 able 	 	 jerk 	 y 	 	,	and	 kill 	 ed 	 	all	of	them	.
i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	 worm 	 s 	 	[	 we 	 re 	 	]	in	there	,	but	i	've	got	some	heavy	karma	coming	,	i	tell	you	.
what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	a	water	filtration	system	.
 th 	 is 	 	 take 	 s 	 	the	water	out	of	the	restaurant	,	 run 	 s 	 	it	through	these	stone	 bed 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	mint	in	there	--	and	i	sort	of	water	the	garden	with	it	.
and	i	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	want	to	 re 	 cycle 	 	that	,	put	it	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 loo 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	wash	 hand 	 s 	 	with	it	,	i	do	n't	know	.
so	,	water	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 medit 	 ating 	 	on	that	and	 create 	 d 	 	a	restaurant	 call 	 ed 	 	waterhouse	.
if	i	could	get	waterhouse	to	be	a	no	-	carbon	restaurant	that	is	 consum 	 ing 	 	no	gas	to	start	with	,	that	would	be	great	.
i	 manage 	 d 	 	to	do	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	restaurant	 look 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	like	 a 	 corn 	 	house	--	same	 chair 	 s 	 	,	same	 table 	 s 	 	.
they	're	all	english	and	a	little	bit	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 electric 	 al 	 	restaurant	.
the	whole	thing	is	electric	,	the	restaurant	and	the	kitchen	.
and	it	's	run	on	 hydro 	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	so	i	've	gone	from	air	to	water	.
now	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	room	is	 cool 	 ed 	 	by	water	,	heated	by	water	,	 filter 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	water	,	and	it	's	powered	by	water	.
it	 liter 	 ally 	 	is	waterhouse	.
the	air	 hand 	 ling 	 	system	 in 	 side 	 	it	--	i	got	rid	of	air	-	 condition 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	there	was	too	much	consumption	going	on	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	air	-	 hand 	 ling 	 	.
i	'm	taking	the	temperature	of	the	 can 	 al 	 	 out 	 side 	 	,	 pump 	 ing 	 	it	through	the	heat	 ex 	 change 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	it	's	 turn 	 ing 	 	through	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 sail 	 s 	 	on	the	roof	,	and	that	,	in	turn	,	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	 soft 	 ly 	 	onto	the	people	in	the	restaurant	,	 cool 	 ing 	 	them	,	or	 heat 	 ing 	 	them	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	need	may	be	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	english	 will 	 ow 	 	air	 diffuse 	 r 	 	,	and	that	's	 soft 	 ly 	 	moving	that	air	current	through	the	room	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	,	no	air	-	 condition 	 ing 	 	--	i	love	it	.
in	the	 can 	 al 	 	,	which	is	just	 out 	 side 	 	the	restaurant	,	there	is	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 meter 	 s 	 	of	coil	 pip 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 take 	 s 	 	the	temperature	of	the	 can 	 al 	 	and	 turn 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	four	-	 degree 	 s 	 	of	heat	 ex 	 change 	 	.
i	have	no	idea	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	,	but	i	paid	a	lot	of	money	for	it	.
and	what	's	great	is	one	of	the	 chef 	 s 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	in	that	restaurant	 live 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	boat	--	it	's	off	-	grid	;	it	 generate 	 s 	 	all	 it 	 s 	 	own	power	.
he	's	growing	all	his	own	fruit	,	and	that	's	fantastic	.
there	's	no	accident	in	 name 	 s 	 	of	these	 restaurant 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 corn 	 	house	is	the	element	of	wood	;	waterhouse	is	the	element	of	water	;	and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	well	,	i	'm	going	to	be	making	five	 restaurant 	 s 	 	based	on	the	five	chinese	medicine	 acu 	 punctu 	 re 	 	 special 	 ities 	 	.
i	've	got	water	and	wood	.	i	'm	just	about	to	do	fire	.
i	've	got	metal	and	earth	to	come	.
so	you	've	got	to	watch	your	space	for	that	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	next	project	.
five	 week 	 s 	 	old	,	it	's	my	baby	,	and	it	's	 hurt 	 ing 	 	real	bad	.
the	people	's	 super 	 market 	 	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	 restaurant 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	hit	people	who	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
what	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	get	food	out	to	a	 broad 	 er 	 	spectrum	of	people	.
so	people	--	i.e	.	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	more	 work 	 ing 	 	-	class	--	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	people	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	 co 	 operative 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	social	enterprise	,	not	-	for	-	profit	 co 	 operative 	 	 super 	 market 	 	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	about	the	social	 dis 	 connect 	 	between	food	,	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	urban	 setting 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	relationship	to	 r 	 ural 	 	 grow 	 ers 	 	--	 connect 	 ing 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	london	to	 r 	 ural 	 	 grow 	 ers 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
so	i	'm	 commit 	 ting 	 	to	 potato 	 es 	 	;	i	'm	 commit 	 ting 	 	to	milk	;	i	'm	 commit 	 ting 	 	to	 le 	 ek 	 s 	 	and	 broc 	 coli 	 	--	all	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	stuff	.
i	've	 ke 	 pt 	 	the	 tile 	 s 	 	;	i	've	 ke 	 pt 	 	the	 floor 	 s 	 	;	i	've	 ke 	 pt 	 	the	 trunk 	 ing 	 	;	i	've	got	in	some	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 f 	 ridge 	 s 	 	;	i	've	got	some	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 till 	 s 	 	;	i	've	got	some	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 troll 	 ey 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	the	whole	thing	is	is	super	-	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	and	i	'm	going	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	the	most	 sustain 	 able 	 	 super 	 market 	 	in	the	world	.
that	's	zero	food	waste	.
and	no	one	's	 do 	 ing 	 	that	just	yet	.
in	fact	,	sainsbury	's	,	if	you	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	let	's	have	a	go	.	try	it	on	.
i	'm	going	to	get	there	before	you	.
so	nature	 do 	 es 	 	n't	create	waste	 do 	 es 	 	n't	create	waste	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	in	nature	is	used	up	in	a	closed	 continu 	 ous 	 	cycle	with	waste	 be 	 ing 	 	the	end	of	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	me	for	some	time	,	and	it	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	to	understand	.
if	we	do	n't	stand	up	and	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	and	think	about	 sustain 	 able 	 	food	,	think	about	the	 sustain 	 able 	 	nature	of	it	,	then	we	may	fail	.
but	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	up	and	show	you	that	we	can	do	it	if	we	're	more	 respons 	 ible 	 	.
 environment 	 ally 	 	conscious	 business 	 es 	 	are	 do 	 able 	 	.
they	're	here	.	you	can	see	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	three	so	far	;	i	've	got	a	few	more	to	go	.
the	idea	is	 embryo 	 nic 	 	.
i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	think	that	if	we	 reduc 	 e 	 	,	 re 	 use 	 	,	 re 	 fuse 	 	and	 re 	 cycle 	 	--	right	at	the	end	there	--	 recycl 	 ing 	 	is	the	last	point	i	want	to	make	;	but	it	's	the	four	r	's	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	three	r	's	--	then	i	think	we	're	going	to	be	on	our	way	.
so	these	three	are	not	perfect	--	they	're	 idea 	 s 	 	.
i	think	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	to	come	,	but	with	help	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	i	'm	going	to	find	 solution 	 s 	 	.
and	i	hope	you	all	take	part	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
