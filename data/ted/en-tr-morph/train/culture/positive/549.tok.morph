i	'm	going	to	go	way	out	on	a	limb	and	say	that	it	is	the	most	 divert 	 ing 	 	paper	ever	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	the	journal	of	 ultra 	 sound 	 	in	medicine	.
the	title	is	``	 observ 	 ations 	 	of	in	-	 ut 	 ero 	 	 masturb 	 ation 	 	.	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	now	on	the	left	you	can	see	the	hand	--	that	's	the	big	arrow	--	and	the	penis	on	the	right	.	the	hand	 hover 	 ing 	 	.
and	over	here	we	have	,	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	 radio 	 logist 	 	israel	meisner	,	``	the	hand	 grasp 	 ing 	 	the	penis	in	a	fashion	 re 	 s 	 em 	 bling 	 	 masturb 	 ation 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	.	``
bear	in	mind	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 ultra 	 sound 	 	,	so	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	moving	 image 	 s 	 	.
orgasm	is	a	 re 	 flex 	 	of	the	 auto 	 nomic 	 	nervous	system	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	part	of	the	nervous	system	that	 deal 	 s 	 	with	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	 conscious 	 ly 	 	control	,	like	 digest 	 ion 	 	,	heart	rate	and	sexual	arousal	.
and	the	orgasm	 re 	 flex 	 	can	be	 trigger 	 ed 	 	by	a	 surprising 	 ly 	 	broad	range	of	 in 	 put 	 	.
genital	 stimul 	 ation 	 	.	 d 	 uh 	 	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	kinsey	 interview 	 ed 	 	a	woman	who	could	be	 br 	 ought 	 	to	orgasm	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	stroke	her	 eye 	 brow 	 	.
people	with	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	 inju 	 ries 	 	,	like	 para 	 plegias 	 	,	 quad 	 ri 	 plegias 	 	,	will	often	develop	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	sensitive	area	right	above	the	level	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 jury 	 	,	 where 	 ver 	 	that	is	.
there	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	knee	orgasm	in	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
i	think	the	most	 cur 	 ious 	 	one	that	i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	was	a	case	report	of	a	woman	who	had	an	orgasm	every	time	she	 brush 	 ed 	 	her	 tee 	 th 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	complex	 sensor 	 y 	 	-	motor	action	of	 brush 	 ing 	 	her	 tee 	 th 	 	was	 trigger 	 ing 	 	orgasm	.
and	she	went	to	a	 neuro 	 logist 	 	who	was	 fascinate 	 d 	 	.
he	 check 	 ed 	 	to	see	if	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	 tooth 	 paste 	 	,	but	no	--	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	any	brand	.
they	 stimul 	 ated 	 	her	 gum 	 s 	 	with	a	 tooth 	 pick 	 	,	to	see	if	that	was	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
no	.	it	was	the	whole	,	you	know	,	motion	.
and	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	to	me	is	that	now	you	would	think	 th 	 is 	 	woman	would	like	have	 excel 	 lent 	 	 or 	 al 	 	 hygien 	 e 	 	.
 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	she	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 s 	 aid 	 	in	the	journal	paper	--	``	she	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	she	was	 possess 	 ed 	 	by	 demo 	 ns 	 	and	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	to	 mouth 	 wash 	 	for	her	 or 	 al 	 	care	.	``
it	's	so	 s 	 ad 	 	.
i	 interview 	 ed 	 	,	when	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	book	,	i	 interview 	 ed 	 	a	woman	who	can	think	 her 	 self 	 	to	orgasm	.
she	was	part	of	a	 stud 	 y 	 	at	rutgers	university	.
you	got	ta	love	that	.	rutgers	.
so	i	 interview 	 ed 	 	her	in	oakland	,	in	a	sushi	restaurant	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	,	could	you	do	it	right	here	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	you	know	i	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	finish	my	meal	if	you	do	n't	mind	.	``
but	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	she	was	kind	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	on	a	bench	 out 	 side 	 	.
it	was	 remark 	 able 	 	.	it	took	about	one	minute	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	,	``	are	you	just	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	the	time	?	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	.	 honest 	 ly 	 	when	i	get	home	i	'm	 usual 	 ly 	 	too	 tire 	 d 	 	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	last	time	she	had	 d 	 one 	 	it	was	on	the	disneyland	 t 	 ram 	 	.
the	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	for	orgasm	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	 spin 	 al 	 	nerve	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 sac 	 ral 	 	nerve	root	,	which	is	back	here	.
and	if	you	trigger	,	if	you	 stimul 	 ate 	 	with	an	 electro 	 de 	 	,	the	precise	spot	,	you	will	trigger	an	orgasm	.
and	it	is	a	fact	that	you	can	trigger	 spin 	 al 	 	 re 	 flex 	 es 	 	in	dead	people	--	a	certain	kind	of	dead	person	,	a	 beat 	 ing 	 	-	heart	cadaver	.

now	in	one	of	these	brain	-	dead	people	,	if	you	trigger	the	right	spot	,	you	will	see	 some 	 thing 	 	every	now	and	then	.
there	is	a	 re 	 flex 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	lazarus	 re 	 flex 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	i	'll	 demonst 	 rate 	 	 a 	 s 	 	best	i	can	,	not	 be 	 ing 	 	dead	.

now	if	you	can	trigger	the	lazarus	 re 	 flex 	 	in	a	dead	person	,	why	not	the	orgasm	 re 	 flex 	 	?
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	to	a	brain	death	expert	,	stephanie	mann	,	who	was	 fool 	 ish 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	return	my	 email 	 s 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	,	could	you	 conceiv 	 ably 	 	trigger	an	orgasm	in	a	dead	person	?	``
