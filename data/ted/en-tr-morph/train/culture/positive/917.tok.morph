i	'm	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.
that	's	what	i	do	in	life	--	 tell 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	writing	 novel 	 s 	 	--	and	 to 	 day 	 	i	would	like	to	tell	you	a	few	 st 	 ories 	 	about	the	art	of	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	some	 super 	 natural 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 djinn 	 i 	 	.
but	before	i	go	there	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	allow	me	to	share	with	you	 glimps 	 es 	 	of	my	personal	story	.
i	will	do	so	with	the	help	of	 word 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	shape	,	the	circle	,	so	 through 	 out 	 	my	talk	,	you	will	come	 a 	 cross 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
i	was	born	in	strasbourg	,	france	to	turkish	 parent 	 s 	 	.
 short 	 ly 	 	after	,	my	 parent 	 s 	 	got	 separat 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	came	to	 tur 	 key 	 	with	my	mom	.
from	then	on	,	i	was	raised	 a 	 s 	 	a	single	child	by	a	single	mother	.
now	in	the	early	1970s	,	in	ankara	,	that	was	a	bit	 un 	 usual 	 	.
our	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	was	full	of	large	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	where	 father 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 head 	 s 	 	of	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	,	so	i	grew	up	 see 	 ing 	 	my	mother	 a 	 s 	 	a	 divorce 	 e 	 	in	a	 patriarch 	 al 	 	environment	.
in	fact	,	i	grew	up	 observ 	 ing 	 	two	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 woman 	 hood 	 	.
on	the	one	hand	was	my	mother	,	a	well	-	educated	,	secular	,	modern	,	 western 	 ized 	 	,	turkish	woman	.
on	the	other	hand	was	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	who	 al 	 so 	 	took	care	of	me	and	was	more	spiritual	,	less	educated	and	 definite 	 ly 	 	less	rational	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	woman	who	read	coffee	 ground 	 s 	 	to	see	the	future	and	 melt 	 ed 	 	lead	 in 	 to 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	to	 f 	 end 	 	off	the	 e 	 vil 	 	eye	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	 visit 	 ed 	 	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	people	with	severe	 ac 	 ne 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	or	 war 	 ts 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
each	time	,	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	would	utter	some	 word 	 s 	 	in	arabic	,	take	a	red	apple	and	stab	it	with	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	rose	 thorn 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	number	of	 war 	 ts 	 	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 move 	 	.
then	one	by	one	,	she	would	 en 	 circle 	 	these	 thorn 	 s 	 	with	dark	ink	.
a	week	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	patient	would	come	back	for	a	follow	-	up	examination	.
now	,	i	'm	aware	that	i	should	not	be	 say 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	front	of	an	audience	of	 scholar 	 s 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	but	the	truth	is	,	of	all	the	people	who	 visit 	 ed 	 	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	 condition 	 s 	 	,	i	did	not	see	 any 	 one 	 	go	back	 un 	 happy 	 	or	 un 	 heal 	 ed 	 	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	how	she	did	 th 	 is 	 	.	was	it	the	power	of	 pray 	 ing 	 	?
in	 respons 	 e 	 	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	 pray 	 ing 	 	is	effective	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ware 	 	of	the	power	of	 circle 	 s 	 	.	``
from	her	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	 among 	 st 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	one	 ver 	 y 	 	precious	 less 	 on 	 	--	that	if	you	want	to	destroy	 some 	 thing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	life	,	be	it	an	 ac 	 ne 	 	,	a	 ble 	 mis 	 h 	 	or	the	human	soul	,	all	you	need	to	do	is	to	surround	it	with	thick	 wall 	 s 	 	.
it	will	dry	up	 in 	 side 	 	.
now	we	all	live	in	some	kind	of	a	social	and	cultural	circle	.
we	all	do	.
we	're	born	 in 	 to 	 	a	certain	family	,	nation	,	class	.
but	if	we	have	no	 connect 	 ion 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	with	the	 world 	 s 	 	beyond	the	one	we	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	,	then	we	too	run	the	risk	of	 dry 	 ing 	 	up	 in 	 side 	 	.
our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	might	shrink	;	our	 heart 	 s 	 	might	 dwindl 	 e 	 	,	and	our	 human 	 ness 	 	might	 with 	 er 	 	if	we	stay	for	too	long	 in 	 side 	 	our	cultural	 cocoon 	 s 	 	.
our	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	family	--	if	all	the	people	in	our	inner	circle	resemble	us	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	we	are	 surround 	 ed 	 	with	our	mirror	image	.
now	one	other	thing	women	like	my	grandma	do	in	 tur 	 key 	 	is	to	cover	 mirror 	 s 	 	with	 vel 	 vet 	 	or	to	hang	them	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 back 	 s 	 	facing	out	.
it	's	an	old	eastern	tradition	based	on	the	knowledge	that	it	's	not	 health 	 y 	 	for	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	too	much	time	 star 	 ing 	 	at	his	own	 reflect 	 ion 	 	.
 iron 	 ically 	 	,	[	living	in	]	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	the	like	-	minded	is	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 danger 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	's	 global 	 ized 	 	world	.
and	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	among	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	 agnostic 	 s 	 	and	 believ 	 ers 	 	,	the	rich	and	the	poor	,	east	and	west	 a 	 like 	 	.
we	tend	to	form	 cluster 	 s 	 	based	on	 similar 	 ity 	 	,	and	then	we	produce	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	about	other	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	people	.
in	my	opinion	,	one	way	of	 transcend 	 ing 	 	these	cultural	 ghetto 	 s 	 	is	through	the	art	of	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	.
 st 	 ories 	 	can	not	demolish	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	,	but	they	can	punch	 hole 	 s 	 	in	our	mental	 wall 	 s 	 	.
and	through	 t 	 hose 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	,	we	can	get	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	the	other	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	like	what	we	see	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	fiction	at	the	age	of	eight	.
my	mother	came	home	one	day	with	a	turquoise	 note 	 book 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	i	'd	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 keep 	 ing 	 	a	personal	journal	.
in	retrospect	,	i	think	she	was	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	my	 sanit 	 y 	 	.
i	was	 constant 	 ly 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	at	home	,	which	was	good	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	i	told	 th 	 is 	 	to	 imagin 	 ary 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	around	me	,	which	was	not	so	good	.
i	was	an	 introvert 	 ed 	 	child	,	to	the	point	of	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	with	 color 	 ed 	 	 cray 	 on 	 s 	 	and	 apolog 	 izing 	 	to	 object 	 s 	 	when	i	 bump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	them	,	so	my	mother	thought	it	might	do	me	good	to	write	down	my	day	-	to	-	day	 experience 	 s 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
what	she	did	n't	know	was	that	i	thought	my	life	was	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	last	thing	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	to	write	about	 my 	 self 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	write	about	people	other	than	me	and	 thing 	 s 	 	that	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	thus	 beg 	 an 	 	my	life	-	long	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	writing	fiction	.
so	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	fiction	for	me	was	less	of	an	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	 manifest 	 ation 	 	than	a	 transcend 	 ent 	 al 	 	journey	 in 	 to 	 	other	 live 	 s 	 	,	other	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
and	 pleas 	 e 	 	bear	with	me	:	i	'll	draw	a	circle	and	come	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
now	one	other	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	around	 th 	 is 	 	same	time	.
my	mother	 be 	 came 	 	a	diplomat	.
so	from	 th 	 is 	 	small	,	 super 	 stit 	 ious 	 	,	middle	-	class	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	of	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	i	was	 zoom 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 p 	 osh 	 	,	 inter 	 national 	 	school	[	in	madrid	]	,	where	i	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	turk	.
it	was	here	that	i	had	my	first	 en 	 counter 	 	with	what	i	call	the	``	 represent 	 ative 	 	 foreign 	 er 	 	.	``
in	our	 class 	 room 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	children	from	all	 national 	 ities 	 	,	yet	 th 	 is 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	did	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	lead	to	a	 cosmo 	 politan 	 	,	egalitarian	 class 	 room 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	it	generated	an	atmosphere	in	which	each	child	was	 s 	 een 	 	--	not	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	on	his	own	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	the	 represent 	 ative 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 large 	 r 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	like	a	 miniatur 	 e 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	which	was	 f 	 un 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	negative	,	with	 regard 	 s 	 	to	a	nation	or	a	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	took	place	.
the	child	who	 represent 	 ed 	 	it	was	 mock 	 ed 	 	,	 ridicul 	 ed 	 	and	 bull 	 ied 	 	 end 	 lessly 	 	.
and	i	should	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	time	i	 attend 	 ed 	 	that	school	,	a	 militar 	 y 	 	 take 	 over 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	my	country	,	a	 gun 	 man 	 	of	my	 national 	 ity 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	the	 pop 	 e 	 	,	and	 tur 	 key 	 	got	zero	 point 	 s 	 	in	[	the	]	eurovision	song	contest	.
i	 skip 	 ped 	 	school	often	and	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 sail 	 or 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	had	my	first	taste	of	cultural	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	there	.
the	other	children	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	about	the	movie	``	 mid 	 night 	 	express	,	``	which	i	had	not	 s 	 een 	 	;	they	 inquir 	 ed 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	a	day	i	 smok 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	thought	all	turks	 we 	 re 	 	heavy	 smok 	 ers 	 	,	and	they	 wonder 	 ed 	 	at	what	age	i	would	start	 cover 	 ing 	 	my	hair	.
i	came	to	learn	that	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	three	main	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	about	my	country	:	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	and	the	veil	.
after	spain	,	we	went	to	jordan	,	germany	and	ankara	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 every 	 where 	 	i	went	,	i	felt	like	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 suit 	 case 	 	i	could	take	with	me	.
 st 	 ories 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	sense	of	center	,	 continu 	 ity 	 	and	 cohere 	 nce 	 	,	the	three	big	cs	that	i	 other 	 wise 	 	 lack 	 ed 	 	.
in	my	mid	-	twenties	,	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	istanbul	,	the	city	i	 ador 	 e 	 	.
i	lived	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 vib 	 rant 	 	,	 divers 	 e 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	where	i	wrote	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	my	 novel 	 s 	 	.
i	was	in	istanbul	when	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	hit	in	1999	.
when	i	ran	out	of	the	building	at	three	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	saw	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 stop 	 ped 	 	me	in	my	 track 	 s 	 	.
there	was	the	local	grocer	there	--	a	 grum 	 py 	 	,	old	man	who	did	n't	sell	alcohol	and	did	n't	speak	to	 marginal 	 s 	 	.
he	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	a	 trans 	 vest 	 ite 	 	with	a	long	black	wig	and	 ma 	 scar 	 a 	 	running	down	her	 cheek 	 s 	 	.
i	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	man	open	a	pack	of	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	with	 trem 	 bling 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	and	 off 	 er 	 	one	to	her	,	and	that	is	the	image	of	the	night	of	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	in	my	mind	 to 	 day 	 	--	a	 conserv 	 ative 	 	grocer	and	a	 cry 	 ing 	 	 trans 	 vest 	 ite 	 	 smok 	 ing 	 	together	on	the	 side 	 walk 	 	.
in	the	face	of	death	and	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	our	mundane	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	 evapo 	 rated 	 	,	and	we	all	 be 	 came 	 	one	even	if	for	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	.
but	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	 st 	 ories 	 	,	too	,	have	a	similar	effect	on	us	.
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	fiction	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 magn 	 itude 	 	of	an	 earth 	 quake 	 	,	but	when	we	are	 read 	 ing 	 	a	good	novel	,	we	 leav 	 e 	 	our	small	,	cozy	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	,	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	night	 al 	 one 	 	and	start	 get 	 ting 	 	to	know	people	we	had	never	met	before	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	had	even	 be 	 en 	 	 bias 	 ed 	 	against	.
 short 	 ly 	 	after	,	i	went	to	a	women	's	college	in	boston	,	then	michigan	.
i	 experience 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	not	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	a	 geo 	 graphical 	 	shift	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 linguist 	 ic 	 	one	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	fiction	in	english	.
i	'm	not	an	 im 	 migrant 	 	,	 refuge 	 e 	 	or	 ex 	 ile 	 	--	they	ask	me	why	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	but	the	commute	between	 language 	 s 	 	 give 	 s 	 	me	the	chance	to	 re 	 create 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	love	writing	in	turkish	,	which	to	me	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 poet 	 ic 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	,	and	i	love	writing	in	english	,	which	to	me	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	and	cerebral	.
so	i	feel	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	each	language	in	a	different	way	.
for	me	,	like	 million 	 s 	 	of	other	people	around	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	,	english	is	an	 acquir 	 ed 	 	language	.
when	you	're	a	 late 	 com 	 er 	 	to	a	language	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	live	there	with	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	and	 perpetu 	 al 	 	 frust 	 ration 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 late 	 com 	 ers 	 	,	we	 al 	 ways 	 	want	to	say	more	,	you	know	,	crack	better	 joke 	 s 	 	,	say	better	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	we	end	up	 say 	 ing 	 	less	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	gap	between	the	mind	and	the	tongue	.
and	that	gap	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 intimid 	 ating 	 	.
but	if	we	manage	not	to	be	 frighten 	 ed 	 	by	it	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 stimul 	 ating 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	boston	--	that	 frust 	 ration 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 stimul 	 ating 	 	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	stage	,	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	course	of	my	life	with	increasing	 anxie 	 ty 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	to	include	in	her	 dai 	 ly 	 	 pray 	 ers 	 	that	i	 urge 	 nt 	 ly 	 	get	married	so	that	i	could	settle	down	once	and	for	all	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	god	 love 	 s 	 	her	,	i	did	get	married	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 settl 	 ing 	 	down	,	i	went	to	arizona	.
and	since	my	husband	is	in	istanbul	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 com 	 mut 	 ing 	 	between	arizona	and	istanbul	--	the	two	 place 	 s 	 	on	the	surface	of	earth	that	could	n't	be	more	different	.
i	guess	one	part	of	me	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	nomad	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	and	 spiritual 	 ly 	 	.
 st 	 ories 	 	 ac 	 company 	 	me	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	my	 piece 	 s 	 	and	 memor 	 ies 	 	together	,	like	an	existential	glue	.
yet	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	i	love	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	 al 	 so 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	to	think	that	they	lose	 the 	 ir 	 	magic	if	and	when	a	story	is	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	more	than	a	story	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	subject	that	i	would	love	to	think	about	together	.
when	my	first	novel	written	in	english	came	out	in	america	,	i	heard	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	remark	from	a	 liter 	 ary 	 	critic	.
``	i	 like 	 d 	 	your	book	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	i	wish	you	had	written	it	 different 	 ly 	 	.	``
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	what	he	 me 	 ant 	 	by	that	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	look	at	it	.	there	's	so	 man 	 y 	 	spanish	,	american	,	hispanic	 character 	 s 	 	in	it	,	but	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	turkish	character	and	it	's	a	man	.	``
now	the	novel	took	place	on	a	university	campus	in	boston	,	so	to	me	,	it	was	normal	that	there	be	more	 inter 	 national 	 	 character 	 s 	 	in	it	than	turkish	 character 	 s 	 	,	but	i	 under 	 stood 	 	what	my	critic	was	looking	for	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	i	would	keep	 disappoint 	 ing 	 	him	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	the	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	my	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
he	was	looking	for	a	turkish	woman	in	the	book	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	one	.
we	often	talk	about	how	 st 	 ories 	 	change	the	world	,	but	we	should	 al 	 so 	 	see	how	the	world	of	 ident 	 ity 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	 affect 	 s 	 	the	way	 st 	 ories 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 circul 	 ated 	 	,	read	and	 review 	 ed 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	 author 	 s 	 	feel	 th 	 is 	 	pressure	,	but	non	-	western	 author 	 s 	 	feel	it	more	 heav 	 ily 	 	.
if	you	're	a	woman	writer	from	the	muslim	world	,	like	me	,	then	you	are	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	write	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	muslim	women	and	,	 prefer 	 ably 	 	,	the	 un 	 happy 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 un 	 happy 	 	muslim	women	.

the	problem	with	 to 	 day 	 	's	cultural	 ghetto 	 s 	 	is	not	lack	of	knowledge	--	we	know	a	lot	about	each	other	,	or	so	we	think	--	but	knowledge	that	 take 	 s 	 	us	not	beyond	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	:	it	 make 	 s 	 	us	 e 	 lit 	 ist 	 	,	 di 	 stant 	 	and	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
there	's	a	metaphor	which	i	love	:	living	like	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	compass	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	one	leg	of	the	compass	is	static	,	 root 	 ed 	 	in	a	place	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	the	other	leg	 draw 	 s 	 	a	wide	circle	,	 constant 	 ly 	 	moving	.
like	that	,	my	fiction	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
one	part	of	it	is	 root 	 ed 	 	in	istanbul	,	with	strong	turkish	 root 	 s 	 	,	but	the	other	part	 travel 	 s 	 	the	world	,	 connect 	 ing 	 	to	different	 culture 	 s 	 	.
in	that	sense	,	i	like	to	think	of	my	fiction	 a 	 s 	 	both	local	and	universal	,	both	from	here	and	 every 	 where 	 	.
now	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	to	istanbul	have	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 een 	 	topkapi	 pa 	 lace 	 	,	which	was	the	residence	of	ottoman	 sultan 	 s 	 	for	more	than	400	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 pa 	 lace 	 	,	just	 out 	 side 	 	the	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	the	 favor 	 ite 	 	 con 	 cub 	 ine 	 s 	 	,	there	's	an	area	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 gather 	 ing 	 	place	of	the	djinn	.
it	's	between	 building 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	.
we	 usual 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 trust 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 area 	 s 	 	that	fall	in	between	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	see	them	 a 	 s 	 	the	domain	of	 super 	 natural 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	like	the	djinn	,	who	are	made	of	 smoke 	 less 	 	fire	and	are	the	symbol	of	 elusive 	 ness 	 	.
but	my	point	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	that	elusive	space	is	what	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 artist 	 s 	 	need	most	.
when	i	write	fiction	i	 cher 	 ish 	 	 elusive 	 ness 	 	and	 change 	 ability 	 	.
i	like	not	 know 	 ing 	 	what	will	happen	10	 page 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
i	like	it	when	my	 character 	 s 	 	surprise	me	.
i	might	write	about	a	muslim	woman	in	one	novel	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	will	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	story	,	and	in	my	next	book	,	i	might	write	about	a	 hand 	 some 	 	,	 ga 	 y 	 	professor	in	norway	.
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	our	 heart 	 s 	 	,	we	can	write	about	 any 	 thing 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
audre	lorde	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	white	 father 	 s 	 	taught	us	to	say	,	'	i	think	,	 there 	 fore 	 	i	am.	'	``	she	 suggest 	 ed 	 	,	``	i	feel	,	 there 	 fore 	 	i	am	free	.	``
i	think	it	was	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	paradigm	shift	.
and	yet	,	why	is	it	that	,	in	creative	writing	 course 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	thing	we	teach	 student 	 s 	 	is	``	write	what	you	know	``	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	that	's	not	the	right	way	to	start	at	all	.
 imagin 	 ative 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	is	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	about	writing	who	we	are	or	what	we	know	or	what	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	is	about	.
we	should	teach	young	people	and	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	expand	our	 heart 	 s 	 	and	write	what	we	can	feel	.
we	should	get	out	of	our	cultural	ghetto	and	go	visit	the	next	one	and	the	next	.
in	the	end	,	 st 	 ories 	 	move	like	 whirl 	 ing 	 	 der 	 vis 	 he 	 s 	 	,	 draw 	 ing 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	beyond	 circle 	 s 	 	.
they	connect	all	 human 	 ity 	 	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	 ident 	 ity 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	the	good	news	.
and	i	would	like	to	finish	with	an	old	sufi	poem	:	``	come	,	let	us	be	 friend 	 s 	 	for	once	;	let	us	make	life	easy	on	us	;	let	us	be	 lover 	 s 	 	and	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	;	the	earth	 s 	 hall 	 	be	left	to	no	one	.	``
thank	you	.
