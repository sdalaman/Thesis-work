 hell 	 o 	 	.	my	name	is	birke	baehr	,	and	i	'm	11	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	came	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	talk	about	what	's	wrong	with	our	food	system	.
first	of	all	,	i	would	like	to	say	that	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	at	how	 eas 	 ily 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	led	to	 believ 	 e 	 	all	the	 market 	 ing 	 	and	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	on	tv	,	at	public	 school 	 s 	 	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 where 	 	else	you	look	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	like	 corporation 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 kid 	 s 	 	,	like	me	,	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	to	buy	stuff	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	n't	good	for	us	or	the	planet	.
little	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	are	 attract 	 ed 	 	by	 color 	 ful 	 	 pack 	 aging 	 	and	plastic	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
i	must	admit	,	i	used	to	be	one	of	them	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	used	to	think	that	all	of	our	food	came	from	these	happy	,	little	 farm 	 s 	 	where	 pig 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ed 	 	in	mud	and	 cow 	 s 	 	 graze 	 d 	 	on	grass	all	day	.
what	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	true	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	look	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	in	 book 	 s 	 	and	in	 document 	 ary 	 	 film 	 s 	 	,	in	my	 travel 	 s 	 	with	my	family	.
i	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	dark	side	of	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	food	system	.
first	,	there	's	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	 seed 	 s 	 	and	 organism 	 s 	 	.
that	is	when	a	seed	is	 manipul 	 ated 	 	in	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	not	 intend 	 ed 	 	by	nature	--	like	taking	the	dna	of	a	fish	and	 put 	 ting 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	dna	of	a	tomato	.	 yu 	 ck 	 	.
do	n't	get	me	wrong	,	i	like	fish	and	 tomato 	 es 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 creep 	 y 	 	.
the	 seed 	 s 	 	are	then	 plant 	 ed 	 	,	then	grown	.
the	food	they	produce	have	 be 	 en 	 	proven	to	cause	cancer	and	other	 problem 	 s 	 	in	lab	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	eating	food	 produce 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	since	the	1990s	.
and	most	 folk 	 s 	 	do	n't	even	know	they	exist	.
did	you	know	 rat 	 s 	 	that	ate	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	corn	had	 develop 	 ed 	 	 sign 	 s 	 	of	liver	and	 kid 	 ney 	 	 toxic 	 ity 	 	?
these	include	 kid 	 ney 	 	 inflamm 	 ation 	 	and	 les 	 ions 	 	and	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 kid 	 ney 	 	weight	.
yet	 al 	 most 	 	all	the	corn	we	eat	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 alter 	 ed 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	in	some	way	.
and	let	me	tell	you	,	corn	is	in	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	do	n't	even	get	me	 start 	 ed 	 	on	the	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	animal	 feed 	 ing 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	cafos	.
 convention 	 al 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	use	chemical	 fertil 	 izer 	 s 	 	made	from	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	that	they	mix	with	the	dirt	to	make	 plant 	 s 	 	grow	.
they	do	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	 strip 	 ped 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	from	all	 nutrient 	 s 	 	from	growing	the	same	crop	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
next	,	more	 harm 	 ful 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	are	 spray 	 ed 	 	on	 fruit 	 s 	 	and	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	,	to	kill	 weed 	 s 	 	and	 bug 	 s 	 	.
when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	,	these	 chemical 	 s 	 	seep	 in 	 to 	 	the	ground	,	or	run	off	 in 	 to 	 	our	 water 	 ways 	 	,	 poison 	 ing 	 	our	water	too	.
then	they	 ir 	 radiate 	 	our	food	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	it	last	 long 	 er 	 	,	so	it	can	travel	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	from	where	it	's	grown	to	the	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	.
so	i	ask	 my 	 self 	 	,	how	can	i	change	?	how	can	i	change	these	 thing 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	found	out	.
i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	there	's	a	 move 	 ment 	 	for	a	better	way	.
now	a	while	back	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	an	nfl	 foot 	 ball 	 	player	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	 farm 	 er 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.
thank	you	.
and	that	way	i	can	have	a	 great 	 er 	 	impact	on	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	man	,	joel	salatin	,	they	call	him	a	 lun 	 atic 	 	 farm 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 grow 	 s 	 	against	the	system	.
since	i	'm	home	-	 school 	 ed 	 	,	i	went	to	go	hear	him	speak	one	day	.
 th 	 is 	 	man	,	 th 	 is 	 	``	 lun 	 atic 	 	 farm 	 er 	 	,	``	 do 	 es 	 	n't	use	any	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	,	 herb 	 icide 	 s 	 	,	or	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	.
and	so	for	that	,	he	's	 call 	 ed 	 	crazy	by	the	system	.
i	want	you	to	know	that	we	can	all	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	by	making	different	 choice 	 s 	 	,	by	 buy 	 ing 	 	our	food	 direct 	 ly 	 	from	local	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	or	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	who	we	know	in	real	life	.
some	people	say	 organ 	 ic 	 	or	local	food	is	more	expensive	,	but	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	?
with	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	the	food	system	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	we	can	either	pay	the	 farm 	 er 	 	,	or	we	can	pay	the	hospital	.
now	i	know	 definite 	 ly 	 	which	one	i	would	 choos 	 e 	 	.
i	want	you	to	know	that	there	are	 farm 	 s 	 	out	there	--	like	bill	 keen 	 er 	 	in	sequatchie	cove	farm	in	tennessee	--	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 cow 	 s 	 	do	eat	grass	and	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 pig 	 s 	 	do	roll	in	the	mud	,	just	like	i	thought	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	go	to	bill	's	farm	and	volunteer	,	so	i	can	see	up	close	and	personal	where	the	meat	i	eat	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
i	want	you	to	know	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	will	eat	fresh	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	and	good	food	if	they	know	more	about	it	and	where	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
i	want	you	to	know	that	there	are	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	 market 	 s 	 	in	every	community	 pop 	 ping 	 	up	.
i	want	you	to	know	that	me	,	my	brother	and	sister	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	eating	 bake 	 d 	 	kale	 chip 	 s 	 	.
i	try	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	 every 	 where 	 	i	go	.
not	too	long	ago	,	my	uncle	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	my	six	-	year	-	old	cousin	 ce 	 real 	 	.
he	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	if	he	 want 	 ed 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 toast 	 ed 	 	o	's	or	the	 sugar 	 co 	 ated 	 	 flake 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	the	one	with	the	big	 strip 	 ed 	 	cartoon	character	on	the	front	.
my	little	cousin	told	his	dad	that	he	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	have	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	 toast 	 ed 	 	o	's	 ce 	 real 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	birke	 s 	 aid 	 	he	should	n't	eat	 spark 	 ly 	 	 ce 	 real 	 	.
and	that	,	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	is	how	we	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	one	kid	at	a	time	.
so	next	time	you	're	at	the	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	,	think	local	,	 choos 	 e 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	know	your	 farm 	 er 	 	and	know	your	food	.
thank	you	.
