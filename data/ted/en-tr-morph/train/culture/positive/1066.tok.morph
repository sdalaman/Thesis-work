i	'm	going	to	make	an	argument	 to 	 day 	 	that	may	seem	a	little	bit	crazy	:	social	media	and	the	end	of	gender	.
let	me	connect	the	 dot 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	 argu 	 e 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	the	social	media	 application 	 s 	 	that	we	all	know	and	love	,	or	love	to	hate	,	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	help	free	us	from	some	of	the	absurd	 assumption 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	about	gender	.
i	think	that	social	media	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	help	us	dismantle	some	of	the	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	and	 de 	 meaning 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	that	we	see	in	media	and	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	about	gender	.
if	you	had	n't	 notice 	 d 	 	,	our	media	climate	 general 	 ly 	 	 provide 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 distort 	 ed 	 	mirror	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	and	of	our	gender	,	and	i	think	that	's	going	to	change	.
now	most	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	--	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	radio	,	 publish 	 ing 	 	,	 game 	 s 	 	,	you	name	it	--	they	use	 ver 	 y 	 	rigid	 segment 	 ation 	 	 method 	 s 	 	in	order	to	understand	 the 	 ir 	 	 audience 	 s 	 	.
it	's	old	-	school	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
they	come	up	with	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 restrict 	 ive 	 	 label 	 s 	 	to	define	us	.
now	the	crazy	thing	is	that	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	if	you	fall	 with 	 in 	 	a	certain	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 categor 	 y 	 	then	you	are	 predict 	 able 	 	in	certain	ways	--	you	have	certain	taste	,	that	you	like	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	bizarre	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	most	of	our	popular	culture	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	based	on	these	 presumption 	 s 	 	about	our	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
age	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	:	the	18	to	49	demo	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	huge	impact	on	all	mass	media	 programm 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	since	the	1960s	,	when	the	baby	 boom 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	still	young	.
now	they	've	aged	out	of	that	 demo 	 graphic 	 	,	but	it	's	still	the	case	that	 power 	 ful 	 	 rating 	 s 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	nielson	do	n't	even	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	 view 	 ers 	 	of	 tele 	 vision 	 	 show 	 s 	 	over	age	54	.
in	our	media	environment	,	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	do	n't	even	exist	.
now	,	if	you	watch	``	mad	men	,	``	like	i	do	--	it	's	a	popular	tv	show	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	--	dr.	faye	miller	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 psycho 	 graphic 	 s 	 	,	which	first	came	about	in	the	1960s	,	where	you	create	these	complex	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 profile 	 s 	 	of	 consumer 	 s 	 	.
but	 psycho 	 graphic 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	have	n't	had	a	huge	impact	on	the	media	business	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	at	the	norman	lear	center	at	usc	,	and	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	of	research	over	the	last	seven	,	eight	 year 	 s 	 	and	how	they	affect	media	and	 entertain 	 ment 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	and	 a 	 broad 	 	.
and	in	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	 specific 	 ally 	 	at	social	media	to	see	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
all	the	people	who	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	social	media	 network 	 s 	 	belong	to	the	same	old	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	that	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 advertise 	 rs 	 	have	used	in	order	to	understand	them	.
but	 t 	 hose 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	mean	even	less	now	than	they	did	before	,	 be 	 cause 	 	with	 on 	 line 	 	 network 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	,	it	's	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	us	to	 es 	 cape 	 	some	of	our	 demo 	 graphic 	 	boxes	.
we	're	able	to	connect	with	people	 quit 	 e 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	and	to	 re 	 define 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 on 	 line 	 	.
and	we	can	lie	about	our	age	 on 	 line 	 	,	too	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	connect	with	people	based	on	our	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 interest 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	need	a	media	company	to	help	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	us	.
so	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	of	course	,	are	 pay 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	close	attention	to	these	 on 	 line 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
they	know	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	mass	audience	of	the	future	;	they	need	to	figure	it	out	.
but	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	hard	time	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	still	 try 	 ing 	 	to	use	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	in	order	to	understand	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	how	ad	rates	are	still	 determine 	 d 	 	.
when	they	're	 monitor 	 ing 	 	your	 click 	 stream 	 	--	and	you	know	they	are	--	they	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	time	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	your	age	,	your	gender	and	your	income	.
they	can	make	some	educated	 guess 	 es 	 	.
but	they	get	a	lot	more	information	about	what	you	do	 on 	 line 	 	,	what	you	like	,	what	 interest 	 s 	 	you	.
that	's	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	them	to	find	out	than	who	you	are	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	that	's	still	sort	of	 creep 	 y 	 	,	there	is	an	 up 	 side 	 	to	 hav 	 ing 	 	your	taste	 monitor 	 ed 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	our	taste	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 respect 	 ed 	 	in	a	way	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	before	.
it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 sum 	 ed 	 	before	.
so	when	you	look	 on 	 line 	 	at	the	way	people	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	,	they	do	n't	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	around	age	,	gender	and	income	.
they	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	around	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	love	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	like	,	and	if	you	think	about	it	,	 share 	 d 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	and	 value 	 s 	 	are	a	far	more	 power 	 ful 	 	 aggreg 	 ator 	 	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	than	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
i	'd	much	 ra 	 ther 	 	know	 whet 	 her 	 	you	like	``	buffy	the	vampire	 s 	 layer 	 	``	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	how	old	you	are	.
that	would	tell	me	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 sub 	 stantial 	 	about	you	.
now	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	about	social	media	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	surprising	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	women	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	social	media	revolution	.
if	you	look	at	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	--	these	are	 world 	 wide 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	--	in	every	single	age	 categor 	 y 	 	,	women	 actual 	 ly 	 	 out 	 number 	 	men	in	 the 	 ir 	 	use	of	social	 network 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
and	then	if	you	look	at	the	amount	of	time	that	they	 s 	 pend 	 	on	these	 s 	 ites 	 	,	they	 tru 	 ly 	 	dominate	the	social	media	space	,	which	is	a	space	that	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	huge	impact	on	old	media	.
the	question	is	:	what	sort	of	impact	is	 th 	 is 	 	going	to	have	on	our	culture	,	and	what	's	it	going	to	mean	for	women	?
if	the	case	is	that	social	media	is	 domin 	 ating 	 	old	media	and	women	are	 domin 	 ating 	 	social	media	,	then	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	that	women	are	going	to	take	over	global	media	?
are	we	 sudden 	 ly 	 	going	to	see	a	lot	more	female	 character 	 s 	 	in	 cartoon 	 s 	 	and	in	 game 	 s 	 	and	on	tv	 show 	 s 	 	?
will	the	next	big	-	budget	 block 	 buster 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	chick	 flick 	 s 	 	?
could	 th 	 is 	 	be	possible	,	that	 sudden 	 ly 	 	our	media	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	a	feminist	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	?
well	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	think	that	's	going	to	be	the	case	.
i	think	that	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	going	to	hire	a	lot	more	women	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 real 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	business	,	and	i	think	that	women	are	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	dominate	the	social	media	sphere	.
but	i	think	women	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	--	 iron 	 ically 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	--	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 driv 	 ing 	 	a	 s 	 take 	 	through	the	heart	of	 che 	 es 	 y 	 	 gen 	 re 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	like	the	``	chick	flick	``	and	all	these	other	 gen 	 re 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	that	 p 	 resume 	 	that	certain	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 group 	 s 	 	like	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	--	that	hispanics	like	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	young	people	like	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	far	too	 simpl 	 istic 	 	.
the	future	 entertain 	 ment 	 	media	that	we	're	going	to	see	is	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	data	-	driven	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	based	on	the	information	that	we	 a 	 s 	 certain 	 	from	taste	 commun 	 ities 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	where	women	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	action	.
so	you	may	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	well	why	is	it	 import 	 ant 	 	that	i	know	what	 entertain 	 s 	 	people	?
why	should	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	?
of	course	,	old	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 advertise 	 rs 	 	need	to	know	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	my	argument	is	that	,	if	you	want	to	understand	the	global	village	,	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	good	idea	that	you	figure	out	what	they	're	passionate	about	,	what	 amuse 	 s 	 	them	,	what	they	 choos 	 e 	 	to	do	in	 the 	 ir 	 	free	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	know	about	people	.
i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	most	of	my	professional	life	 research 	 ing 	 	media	and	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	impact	on	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	i	do	it	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	--	 th 	 ough 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 un 	 	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	our	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	that	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	play	have	a	huge	impact	on	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	--	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 belief 	 s 	 	and	on	 the 	 ir 	 	health	.
and	so	,	if	you	have	any	interest	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	looking	at	how	people	amuse	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	way	to	start	.
so	imagine	a	media	atmosphere	that	is	n't	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	 lam 	 e 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	about	gender	and	other	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	.
can	you	even	imagine	what	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	?
i	ca	n't	wait	to	find	out	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
thank	you	so	much	.
