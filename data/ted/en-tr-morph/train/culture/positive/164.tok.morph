 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	maurice	druon	,	the	honorary	 perpetu 	 al 	 	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	l'academie	 franc 	 a 	 ise 	 	,	the	french	academy	.
he	is	 splendid 	 ly 	 	 attire 	 d 	 	in	his	68,000	-	dollar	uniform	,	 be 	 fitting 	 	the	role	of	the	french	academy	 a 	 s 	 	 legisl 	 ating 	 	the	correct	 us 	 age 	 	in	french	and	 perpetu 	 ating 	 	the	language	.
the	french	academy	 ha 	 s 	 	two	main	 task 	 s 	 	:	it	 compil 	 es 	 	a	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	of	official	french	.
they	're	now	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	 ed 	 ition 	 	,	which	they	 beg 	 an 	 	in	1930	,	and	they	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	letter	p	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	 legisl 	 ate 	 	on	correct	 us 	 age 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	proper	term	for	what	the	french	call	``	email	,	``	which	ought	to	be	``	courriel	.	``
the	world	wide	web	,	the	french	are	told	,	ought	to	be	 refer 	 red 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	``	la	 to 	 ile 	 	d'araignee	 mon 	 dial 	 e 	 	``	--	the	global	spider	web	--	 recommend 	 ations 	 	that	the	french	 gai 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 e 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	model	of	how	language	 come 	 s 	 	to	be	:	 name 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 legisl 	 ated 	 	by	an	academy	.
but	 any 	 one 	 	who	 look 	 s 	 	at	language	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	 conce 	 it 	 	,	that	language	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	 emerge 	 s 	 	from	human	 mind 	 s 	 	 interact 	 ing 	 	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	visible	in	the	 un 	 stop 	 p 	 able 	 	change	in	language	--	the	fact	that	by	the	time	the	academy	 finish 	 es 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	it	will	 al 	 ready 	 	be	well	out	of	date	.
we	see	it	in	the	constant	 appear 	 ance 	 	of	 s 	 l 	 ang 	 	and	 jar 	 gon 	 	,	of	the	 historic 	 al 	 	change	in	 language 	 s 	 	,	in	 diverge 	 nce 	 	of	 dialect 	 s 	 	and	the	 form 	 ation 	 	of	new	 language 	 s 	 	.
so	language	is	not	so	much	a	creator	or	 sha 	 per 	 	of	human	nature	,	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	a	window	onto	human	nature	.
in	a	book	that	i	'm	 current 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	i	hope	to	use	language	to	shed	light	on	a	number	of	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	human	nature	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	cognitive	 machine 	 ry 	 	with	which	 human 	 s 	 	 conceptual 	 ize 	 	the	world	and	the	relationship	 type 	 s 	 	that	govern	human	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	say	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	about	each	one	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
let	me	start	off	with	a	technical	problem	in	language	that	i	've	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	for	 quit 	 e 	 	some	time	--	and	indulge	me	in	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	 verb 	 s 	 	and	how	they	're	used	.
the	problem	is	,	which	 verb 	 s 	 	go	in	which	 construction 	 s 	 	?
the	verb	is	the	 cha 	 s 	 sis 	 	of	the	sentence	.
it	's	the	 frame 	 work 	 	onto	which	the	other	 part 	 s 	 	are	 bolt 	 ed 	 	.
let	me	give	you	a	quick	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	've	long	 for 	 gotten 	 	.
an	 in 	 transit 	 ive 	 	verb	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	dine	,	``	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	ca	n't	take	a	direct	object	.
you	have	to	say	,	``	sam	 din 	 ed 	 	,	``	not	,	``	sam	 din 	 ed 	 	the	pizza	.	``
a	 transit 	 ive 	 	verb	 man 	 date 	 s 	 	that	there	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	an	object	there	:	``	sam	 devour 	 ed 	 	the	pizza	.	``	you	ca	n't	just	say	,	``	sam	 devour 	 ed 	 	.	``
there	are	 dozen 	 s 	 	or	 score 	 s 	 	of	 verb 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	type	,	each	of	which	 shape 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	sentence	.
so	,	a	problem	in	 explain 	 ing 	 	how	children	learn	language	,	a	problem	in	 teach 	 ing 	 	language	to	 adult 	 s 	 	so	that	they	do	n't	make	grammatical	 error 	 s 	 	,	and	a	problem	in	 programm 	 ing 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	to	use	language	is	which	 verb 	 s 	 	go	in	which	 construction 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 d 	 ative 	 	construction	in	english	.
you	can	say	,	``	give	a	muffin	to	a	mouse	,	``	the	 pre 	 position 	 al 	 	 d 	 ative 	 	.
or	,	``	give	a	mouse	a	muffin	,	``	the	double	-	object	 d 	 ative 	 	.
``	promise	 any 	 thing 	 	to	her	,	``	``	promise	her	 any 	 thing 	 	,	``	and	so	on	.
 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 verb 	 s 	 	can	go	both	ways	.
so	a	 tempt 	 ing 	 	 general 	 ization 	 	for	a	child	,	for	an	adult	,	for	a	computer	is	that	any	verb	that	can	appear	in	the	construction	,	``	subject	-	verb	-	thing	-	to	-	a	-	recipient	``	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	 express 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	subject	-	verb	-	recipient	-	thing	.	``
a	 hand 	 y 	 	thing	to	have	,	 be 	 cause 	 	language	is	infinite	,	and	you	ca	n't	just	 par 	 rot 	 	back	the	 sentence 	 s 	 	that	you	've	heard	.
you	've	got	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	 general 	 ization 	 s 	 	so	you	can	produce	and	understand	new	 sentence 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	be	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	to	do	that	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	there	appear	to	be	 idio 	 syn 	 cratic 	 	 exception 	 s 	 	.
you	can	say	,	``	biff	drove	the	car	to	chicago	,	``	but	not	,	``	biff	drove	chicago	the	car	.	``
you	can	say	,	``	sal	 g 	 ave 	 	jason	a	 head 	 ache 	 	,	``	but	it	's	a	bit	odd	to	say	,	``	sal	 g 	 ave 	 	a	 head 	 ache 	 	to	jason	.	``
the	solution	is	that	these	 construction 	 s 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 initi 	 al 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	,	are	not	synonymous	,	that	when	you	crank	up	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	on	human	cognition	,	you	see	that	there	's	a	subtle	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	meaning	between	them	.
so	,	``	give	the	x	to	the	y	,	``	that	construction	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	the	thought	``	cause	x	to	go	to	y.	``	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	``	give	the	y	the	x	``	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	the	thought	``	cause	y	to	have	x.	``
now	,	 man 	 y 	 	 event 	 s 	 	can	be	subject	to	either	construal	,	kind	of	like	the	classic	figure	-	ground	 revers 	 al 	 	 illusion 	 s 	 	,	in	which	you	can	either	pay	attention	to	the	 part 	 icular 	 	object	,	in	which	case	the	space	around	it	 reced 	 es 	 	from	attention	,	or	you	can	see	the	 face 	 s 	 	in	the	empty	space	,	in	which	case	the	object	 reced 	 es 	 	out	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
how	are	these	 construal 	 s 	 	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	language	?
well	,	in	both	 case 	 s 	 	,	the	thing	that	is	 construe 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	is	 express 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	direct	object	,	the	 no 	 un 	 	after	the	verb	.
so	,	when	you	think	of	the	event	 a 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	muffin	to	go	 some 	 where 	 	--	where	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	muffin	--	you	say	,	``	give	the	muffin	to	the	mouse	.	``
when	you	construe	it	 a 	 s 	 	``	cause	the	mouse	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	,	``	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	mouse	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	you	express	it	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	give	the	mouse	the	muffin	.	``
so	which	 verb 	 s 	 	go	in	which	construction	--	the	problem	with	which	i	 beg 	 an 	 	--	 depend 	 s 	 	on	 whet 	 her 	 	the	verb	 spec 	 ifies 	 	a	kind	of	motion	or	a	kind	of	 possess 	 ion 	 	change	.
to	give	 some 	 thing 	 	 involve 	 s 	 	both	 caus 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	go	and	 caus 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	to	have	.
to	drive	the	car	 on 	 ly 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	go	,	 be 	 cause 	 	chicago	's	not	the	kind	of	thing	that	can	possess	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	 human 	 s 	 	can	possess	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	to	give	 some 	 one 	 	a	 head 	 ache 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	them	to	have	the	 head 	 ache 	 	,	but	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	're	taking	the	 head 	 ache 	 	out	of	your	head	and	 caus 	 ing 	 	it	to	go	to	the	other	person	,	and	 implant 	 ing 	 	it	in	them	.
you	may	just	be	loud	or	 ob 	 nox 	 ious 	 	,	or	some	other	way	 caus 	 ing 	 	them	to	have	the	 head 	 ache 	 	.
so	,	that	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	kind	of	thing	that	i	do	in	my	day	job	.
so	why	should	 any 	 one 	 	care	?
well	,	there	are	a	number	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	from	 th 	 is 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	similar	 kind 	 s 	 	of	analyses	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	english	 verb 	 s 	 	.
first	,	there	's	a	level	of	fine	-	grained	conceptual	structure	,	which	we	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	and	 un 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	compute	every	time	we	produce	or	utter	a	sentence	,	that	 govern 	 s 	 	our	use	of	language	.
you	can	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	language	of	thought	,	or	``	 ment 	 alese 	 	.	``
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	based	on	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	set	of	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	which	govern	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 construction 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 verb 	 s 	 	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	english	,	but	in	all	other	 language 	 s 	 	--	fundamental	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	space	,	time	,	 caus 	 ation 	 	and	human	 intent 	 ion 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	what	is	the	 mean 	 s 	 	and	what	is	the	 end 	 s 	 	?
these	are	 re 	 mini 	 s 	 cent 	 	of	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 categor 	 ies 	 	that	immanuel	kant	 argu 	 ed 	 	are	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	for	human	thought	,	and	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	our	 un 	 conscious 	 	use	of	language	 seem 	 s 	 	to	reflect	these	kantian	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	about	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	color	,	 text 	 ure 	 	,	weight	and	speed	,	which	 virtual 	 ly 	 	never	 different 	 iate 	 	the	use	of	 verb 	 s 	 	in	different	 construction 	 s 	 	.
an	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	twist	is	that	all	of	the	 construction 	 s 	 	in	english	are	used	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	but	in	a	quasi	-	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	way	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	construction	,	the	 d 	 ative 	 	,	is	used	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	transfer	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	for	the	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	transfer	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	when	we	say	,	``	she	told	a	story	to	me	``	or	``	told	me	a	story	,	``	``	max	taught	spanish	to	the	 student 	 s 	 	``	or	``	taught	the	 student 	 s 	 	spanish	.	``
it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	construction	,	but	no	 muffin 	 s 	 	,	no	 mic 	 e 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	moving	at	all	.
it	 evoke 	 s 	 	the	 contain 	 er 	 	metaphor	of	communication	,	in	which	we	 conceiv 	 e 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	 sentence 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 contain 	 ers 	 	,	and	communication	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	when	we	say	we	``	gather	``	our	 idea 	 s 	 	,	to	``	put	``	them	``	 in 	 to 	 	``	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	if	our	 word 	 s 	 	are	n't	``	empty	``	or	``	hollow	,	``	we	might	get	these	 idea 	 s 	 	``	 a 	 cross 	 	``	to	a	 listen 	 er 	 	,	who	can	``	 un 	 pack 	 	``	our	 word 	 s 	 	to	``	 ex 	 tract 	 	``	 the 	 ir 	 	``	content	.	``
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 verb 	 i 	 age 	 	is	not	the	exception	,	but	the	rule	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	find	any	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	abstract	language	that	is	not	based	on	some	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	metaphor	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	can	use	the	verb	``	go	``	and	the	 pre 	 position 	 s 	 	``	to	``	and	``	from	``	in	a	 liter 	 al 	 	,	spatial	sense	.
``	the	messenger	went	from	paris	to	istanbul	.	``
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	say	,	``	biff	went	from	sick	to	well	.	``
he	need	n't	go	 any 	 where 	 	.	he	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	bed	the	whole	time	,	but	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	his	health	is	a	point	in	state	space	that	you	 conceptual 	 ize 	 	 a 	 s 	 	moving	.
or	,	``	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	went	from	three	to	four	,	``	in	which	we	 conceiv 	 e 	 	of	time	 a 	 s 	 	 stretch 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	a	line	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	we	use	``	force	``	to	 indic 	 ate 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	physical	force	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	,	``	rose	 force 	 d 	 	the	door	to	open	,	``	but	 al 	 so 	 	 inter 	 personal 	 	force	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	,	``	rose	 force 	 d 	 	sadie	to	go	,	``	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	by	 man 	 hand 	 ling 	 	her	,	but	by	 is 	 suing 	 	a	threat	.
or	,	``	rose	 force 	 d 	 	 her 	 self 	 	to	go	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	if	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 ent 	 ities 	 	 in 	 side 	 	rose	's	head	,	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	a	tug	of	a	war	.
second	 con 	 clusion 	 	is	that	the	ability	to	 conceiv 	 e 	 	of	a	 give 	 n 	 	event	in	two	different	ways	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	cause	 some 	 thing 	 	to	go	to	 some 	 one 	 	``	and	``	 caus 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	,	``	i	think	is	a	fundamental	feature	of	human	thought	,	and	it	's	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	much	human	 argument 	 ation 	 	,	in	which	people	do	n't	differ	so	much	on	the	 fact 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	on	how	they	ought	to	be	 construe 	 d 	 	.
just	to	give	you	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	:	``	 end 	 ing 	 	a	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	``	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	``	 kill 	 ing 	 	a	fetus	;	``	``	a	ball	of	 cell 	 s 	 	``	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	``	an	 un 	 born 	 	child	;	``	``	 invad 	 ing 	 	 ir 	 aq 	 	``	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	``	 liber 	 ating 	 	 ir 	 aq 	 	;	``	``	 re 	 distribut 	 ing 	 	wealth	``	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	``	 confisc 	 ating 	 	 earn 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	think	the	 big 	 gest 	 	picture	of	all	would	take	 serious 	 ly 	 	the	fact	that	so	much	of	our	 verb 	 i 	 age 	 	about	abstract	 event 	 s 	 	is	based	on	a	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	metaphor	and	see	human	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 consist 	 ing 	 	of	a	repertoire	of	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	--	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	space	,	time	,	 caus 	 ation 	 	and	 intent 	 ion 	 	--	which	are	 use 	 ful 	 	in	a	social	,	knowledge	-	intensive	species	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	evolution	you	can	well	imagine	,	and	a	process	of	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	 abstract 	 ion 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	bleach	these	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	original	conceptual	content	--	space	,	time	and	force	--	and	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	new	abstract	 domain 	 s 	 	,	 there 	 fore 	 	 allow 	 ing 	 	a	species	that	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	deal	with	 rock 	 s 	 	and	 tool 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	,	to	 conceptual 	 ize 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	physics	,	law	and	other	abstract	 domain 	 s 	 	.
well	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	'd	talk	about	two	 window 	 s 	 	on	human	nature	--	the	cognitive	 machine 	 ry 	 	with	which	we	 conceptual 	 ize 	 	the	world	,	and	now	i	'm	going	to	say	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	about	the	relationship	 type 	 s 	 	that	govern	human	social	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	language	.
and	i	'll	start	out	with	a	 puzzl 	 e 	 	,	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	of	 in 	 direct 	 	speech	 act 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	most	of	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	movie	``	fargo	.	``
and	you	might	remember	the	scene	in	which	the	 kidnap 	 per 	 	is	 pull 	 ed 	 	over	by	a	police	officer	,	is	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	show	his	driver	's	 licens 	 e 	 	and	 hold 	 s 	 	his	wallet	out	with	a	50	-	dollar	bill	 extend 	 ing 	 	at	a	 s 	 light 	 	angle	out	of	the	wallet	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	was	just	 think 	 ing 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	we	could	take	care	of	it	here	in	fargo	,	``	which	 every 	 one 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	audience	,	 interpret 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 veil 	 ed 	 	bribe	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 in 	 direct 	 	speech	is	 ramp 	 ant 	 	in	language	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	polite	 request 	 s 	 	,	if	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	if	you	could	pass	the	 gua 	 ca 	 mole 	 	,	that	would	be	awesome	,	``	we	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	he	 mean 	 s 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	that	's	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	bizarre	 con 	 cept 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 express 	 ed 	 	.
``	would	you	like	to	come	up	and	see	my	 etch 	 ing 	 s 	 	?	``
i	think	most	people	understand	the	intent	 be 	 hind 	 	that	.
and	 like 	 wise 	 	,	if	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	nice	store	you	've	got	there	.	it	would	be	a	real	shame	if	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	it	``	--	--	we	understand	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	 veil 	 ed 	 	threat	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	 mus 	 ing 	 	of	hypothetical	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
so	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	is	,	why	are	 bribe 	 s 	 	,	polite	 request 	 s 	 	,	 solicit 	 ations 	 	and	 threat 	 s 	 	so	often	 veil 	 ed 	 	?
no	one	's	 fool 	 ed 	 	.
both	 part 	 ies 	 	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	speaker	 mean 	 s 	 	,	and	the	speaker	 know 	 s 	 	the	 listen 	 er 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	the	speaker	 know 	 s 	 	that	the	 listen 	 er 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
so	what	's	going	on	?
i	think	the	key	idea	is	that	language	is	a	way	of	 negoti 	 ating 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	and	human	 relationship 	 s 	 	fall	 in 	 to 	 	a	number	of	 type 	 s 	 	.
there	's	an	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	 tax 	 o 	 nomy 	 	by	the	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	alan	fiske	,	in	which	 relationship 	 s 	 	can	be	 categor 	 ized 	 	,	more	or	less	,	 in 	 to 	 	 commun 	 ality 	 	,	which	 work 	 s 	 	on	the	principle	``	what	's	mine	is	 th 	 ine 	 	,	what	's	 th 	 ine 	 	is	mine	,	``	the	kind	of	 mind 	 set 	 	that	 oper 	 ates 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	family	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	;	 domin 	 ance 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	principle	is	``	do	n't	mess	with	me	;	``	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	,	``	you	scratch	my	back	,	i	'll	scratch	 your 	 s 	 	;	``	and	 sexual 	 ity 	 	,	in	the	 im 	 mortal 	 	 word 	 s 	 	of	cole	 port 	 er 	 	,	``	let	's	do	it	.	``
now	,	relationship	 type 	 s 	 	can	be	 negoti 	 ated 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	there	are	default	 situ 	 ations 	 	in	which	one	of	these	 mind 	 set 	 s 	 	can	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	,	they	can	be	 stretch 	 ed 	 	and	 extend 	 ed 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 commun 	 ality 	 	 appli 	 es 	 	most	 natural 	 ly 	 	 with 	 in 	 	family	or	 friend 	 s 	 	,	but	it	can	be	used	to	try	to	transfer	the	 ment 	 ality 	 	of	sharing	to	 group 	 s 	 	that	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	would	not	be	 dispos 	 ed 	 	to	 exercis 	 e 	 	it	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	 brother 	 hood 	 s 	 	,	 fratern 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 or 	 or 	 ities 	 	,	 locu 	 tions 	 	like	``	the	family	of	man	,	``	you	try	to	get	people	who	are	not	related	to	use	the	relationship	type	that	would	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	be	appropriate	to	close	kin	.
now	,	 mis 	 match 	 es 	 	--	when	one	person	 assum 	 es 	 	one	relationship	type	,	and	 an 	 other 	 	 assum 	 es 	 	a	different	one	--	can	be	awkward	.
if	you	went	over	and	you	 help 	 ed 	 	 your 	 self 	 	to	a	shrimp	off	your	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	'	plate	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	that	would	be	an	awkward	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
or	if	a	 d 	 inner 	 	guest	after	the	meal	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	his	wallet	and	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	pay	you	for	the	meal	,	that	would	be	 ra 	 ther 	 	awkward	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
in	less	blatant	 case 	 s 	 	,	there	's	still	a	kind	of	 negoti 	 ation 	 	that	often	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
in	the	 work 	 place 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	's	often	a	tension	over	 whet 	 her 	 	an	 employ 	 ee 	 	can	 social 	 ize 	 	with	the	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	,	or	refer	to	him	or	her	on	a	first	-	name	 bas 	 is 	 	.
if	two	 friend 	 s 	 	have	a	 reciproc 	 al 	 	 trans 	 action 	 	,	like	selling	a	car	,	it	's	well	known	that	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	a	source	of	tension	or	 awkward 	 ness 	 	.
in	 d 	 ating 	 	,	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	from	 friend 	 ship 	 	to	 s 	 ex 	 	can	lead	to	,	 notorious 	 ly 	 	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 awkward 	 ness 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	can	 s 	 ex 	 	in	the	 work 	 place 	 	,	in	which	we	call	the	conflict	between	a	 domin 	 ant 	 	and	a	sexual	relationship	``	sexual	 harass 	 ment 	 	.	``
well	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	have	to	do	with	language	?
well	,	language	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	social	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	to	satisfy	two	 condition 	 s 	 	.
you	have	to	convey	the	actual	content	--	here	we	get	back	to	the	 contain 	 er 	 	metaphor	.
you	want	to	express	the	bribe	,	the	command	,	the	promise	,	the	 solicit 	 ation 	 	and	so	on	,	but	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	and	maintain	the	kind	of	relationship	you	have	with	the	other	person	.
the	solution	,	i	think	,	is	that	we	use	language	at	two	 level 	 s 	 	:	the	 liter 	 al 	 	form	 signal 	 s 	 	the	 safe 	 st 	 	relationship	with	the	 listen 	 er 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 implic 	 ated 	 	content	--	the	 read 	 ing 	 	between	the	lines	that	we	count	on	the	 listen 	 er 	 	to	perform	--	 allow 	 s 	 	the	 listen 	 er 	 	to	 der 	 ive 	 	the	 interpret 	 ation 	 	which	is	most	relevant	in	 con 	 text 	 	,	which	possibly	 initi 	 ates 	 	a	 change 	 d 	 	relationship	.
the	 simpl 	 est 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	polite	request	.
if	you	express	your	request	 a 	 s 	 	a	 condition 	 al 	 	--	``	if	you	could	open	the	window	,	that	would	be	great	``	--	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	content	is	an	 imper 	 ative 	 	,	the	fact	that	you	're	not	using	the	 imper 	 ative 	 	voice	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	're	not	 act 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	're	in	a	relationship	of	 domin 	 ance 	 	,	where	you	could	 pre 	 suppose 	 	the	compliance	of	the	other	person	.
on	the	other	hand	,	you	want	the	damn	 gua 	 ca 	 mole 	 	.
by	 express 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	if	-	then	 state 	 ment 	 	,	you	can	get	the	 mess 	 age 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 appear 	 ing 	 	to	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	person	around	.
and	in	a	more	subtle	way	,	i	think	,	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	for	all	of	the	 veil 	 ed 	 	speech	 act 	 s 	 	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	plausible	 deni 	 ability 	 	:	the	 bribe 	 s 	 	,	 threat 	 s 	 	,	 pro 	 position 	 s 	 	,	 solicit 	 ations 	 	and	so	on	.
one	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	is	to	imagine	what	it	would	be	like	if	language	--	where	it	could	 on 	 ly 	 	be	used	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
and	you	can	think	of	it	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	a	game	-	theoretic	 pay 	 off 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
put	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	position	of	the	 kidnap 	 per 	 	 want 	 ing 	 	to	bribe	the	officer	.
there	's	a	high	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	in	the	two	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 dis 	 honest 	 	officer	or	an	honest	officer	.
if	you	do	n't	bribe	the	officer	,	then	you	will	get	a	traffic	ticket	--	or	,	 a 	 s 	 	is	the	case	of	``	fargo	,	``	 wo 	 rse 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	the	honest	officer	is	honest	or	 dis 	 honest 	 	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	 venture 	 d 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 gain 	 ed 	 	.
in	that	case	,	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	are	 ra 	 ther 	 	severe	.
on	the	other	hand	,	if	you	extend	the	bribe	,	if	the	officer	is	 dis 	 honest 	 	,	you	get	a	huge	 pay 	 off 	 	of	going	free	.
if	the	officer	is	honest	,	you	get	a	huge	 penal 	 ty 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 arrest 	 ed 	 	for	 bribe 	 ry 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 frau 	 ght 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	with	 in 	 direct 	 	language	,	if	you	issue	a	 veil 	 ed 	 	bribe	,	then	the	 dis 	 honest 	 	officer	could	interpret	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	bribe	,	in	which	case	you	get	the	 pay 	 off 	 	of	going	free	.
the	honest	officer	ca	n't	hold	you	to	it	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	bribe	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	you	get	the	 nuis 	 ance 	 	of	the	traffic	ticket	.
so	you	get	the	best	of	both	 world 	 s 	 	.
and	a	similar	analysis	,	i	think	,	can	 app 	 ly 	 	to	the	potential	 awkward 	 ness 	 	of	a	sexual	 solicit 	 ation 	 	,	and	other	 case 	 s 	 	where	plausible	 deni 	 ability 	 	is	an	asset	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 affirm 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	long	 be 	 en 	 	known	by	 diplomat 	 s 	 	--	 name 	 ly 	 	,	that	the	 vague 	 ness 	 	of	language	,	far	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	bug	or	an	 im 	 perfect 	 ion 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	might	be	a	feature	of	language	,	one	that	we	use	to	our	advantage	in	social	 interact 	 ions 	 	.
so	to	sum	up	:	language	is	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	human	creation	,	 reflect 	 ing 	 	human	nature	,	how	we	 conceptual 	 ize 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	,	how	we	 re 	 late 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	then	by	 analyz 	 ing 	 	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 quirk 	 s 	 	and	 complex 	 ities 	 	of	language	,	i	think	we	can	get	a	window	onto	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	tick	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
