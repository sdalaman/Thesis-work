video	:	 nar 	 rator 	 	:	an	event	 s 	 een 	 	from	one	point	of	view	 give 	 s 	 	one	impression	.
 s 	 een 	 	from	 an 	 other 	 	point	of	view	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	different	impression	.
but	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	when	you	get	the	whole	picture	you	can	fully	understand	what	's	going	on	.
sasha	vucinic	:	it	's	a	great	clip	,	is	n't	it	?
and	i	found	that	in	29	 second 	 s 	 	,	it	 tell 	 s 	 	more	about	the	power	of	,	and	 import 	 ance 	 	of	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	media	than	i	could	say	in	an	hour	.
so	i	thought	that	it	will	be	good	to	start	with	it	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	start	with	a	little	bit	of	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	relevant	 research 	 ers 	 	,	83	percent	of	the	population	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	 socie 	 ties 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	press	.
think	about	that	number	:	83	percent	of	the	population	on	the	whole	planet	 do 	 es 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	is	going	on	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
the	information	they	get	 get 	 s 	 	 filter 	 ed 	 	through	 some 	 body 	 	who	either	 twist 	 s 	 	that	information	,	or	 color 	 s 	 	that	information	,	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	with	it	.
so	they	're	 depriv 	 ed 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
that	is	just	to	understand	how	big	and	 import 	 ant 	 	 th 	 is 	 	problem	is	.
now	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	live	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	that	represent	17	percent	,	i	think	should	enjoy	it	 un 	 til 	 	it	 last 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	sunday	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	you	flick	the	paper	,	get	your	 cap 	 puccino 	 	.
enjoy	it	while	it	 last 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	 yester 	 day 	 	,	 count 	 ries 	 	can	lose	 star 	 s 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 flag 	 s 	 	,	but	they	can	 al 	 so 	 	lose	press	 free 	 dom 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	guess	americans	among	us	can	tell	us	more	about	.
but	that	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 an 	 other 	 	and	 separat 	 e 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	.
so	i	can	go	back	to	my	story	.
my	story	 start 	 s 	 	--	the	story	i	want	to	share	--	 start 	 s 	 	in	1991	.
at	that	time	i	was	running	b	92	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	,	for	that	matter	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	media	,	in	the	country	.
and	i	guess	we	 we 	 re 	 	sharing	--	we	had	that	regular	life	of	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	media	in	the	country	,	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	 hostil 	 e 	 	environment	,	where	government	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	make	your	life	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	.
and	there	are	different	ways	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	was	the	usual	 cock 	 tail 	 	:	a	little	bit	of	 threat 	 s 	 	,	a	little	bit	of	friendly	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	a	little	bit	of	financial	police	,	a	little	bit	of	text	control	,	so	you	 al 	 ways 	 	have	 some 	 body 	 	who	never	 leav 	 es 	 	your	 off 	 ice 	 	.
but	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	do	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	and	that	is	what	 government 	 s 	 	in	the	late	'90s	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	if	they	do	n't	like	 in 	 dependent 	 	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	--	you	know	,	they	threaten	your	 advertise 	 rs 	 	.
once	they	threaten	your	 advertise 	 rs 	 	,	market	 force 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	,	 destroy 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	 advertise 	 rs 	 	do	not	want	to	come	--	no	matter	how	much	 do 	 es 	 	it	make	sense	for	them	--	do	not	want	to	come	and	advertise	.
and	you	have	a	problem	making	 end 	 s 	 	meet	.
at	that	time	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	'90s	,	we	had	that	problem	,	which	was	,	you	know	,	 surviv 	 al 	 	 be 	 low 	 	one	side	,	but	what	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	for	me	was	,	remember	,	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	'90s	,	yugoslavia	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	over	there	with	a	country	in	a	 down 	 fall 	 	,	in	a	 s 	 low 	 	-	motion	 down 	 fall 	 	.
and	we	all	had	all	of	that	on	 tape 	 s 	 	.
we	had	the	ability	to	understand	what	was	going	on	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 record 	 ing 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
the	problem	was	that	we	had	to	re	-	tape	that	 histo 	 ry 	 	a	week	 lat 	 er 	 	;	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	did	not	,	we	could	not	afford	 en 	 ough 	 	 tape 	 s 	 	to	keep	 archiv 	 es 	 	of	that	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
so	if	i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	that	picture	,	i	do	n't	want	to	go	too	long	on	that	.
in	that	 con 	 text 	 	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	came	to	my	 off 	 ice 	 	at	that	time	.
it	was	still	1991	.
he	was	running	a	media	 system 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	which	is	still	in	business	,	the	 gentle 	 man 	 	is	still	in	business	.
and	what	did	i	know	at	that	time	about	media	 system 	 s 	 	?
i	would	think	media	 system 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	should	help	you	.
so	i	prepared	two	 plan 	 s 	 	for	that	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	two	 strat 	 egic 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	:	the	small	one	and	the	big	one	.
the	small	one	was	,	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	him	to	help	us	get	 t 	 hose 	 	damn	 tape 	 s 	 	,	so	we	can	keep	that	 archiv 	 e 	 	for	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	big	plan	was	to	ask	him	for	a	1,000,000	-	dollar	loan	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	,	i	still	maintain	,	that	serious	and	 in 	 dependent 	 	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	great	business	.
and	i	thought	that	b	92	will	 surviv 	 e 	 	and	be	a	great	company	once	milosevic	is	gone	,	which	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	true	.
it	's	now	 prob 	 ably 	 	either	the	 big 	 gest 	 	or	the	second	 big 	 gest 	 	media	company	in	the	country	.
and	i	thought	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	at	that	time	was	1,000,000	-	dollar	loan	to	take	us	through	 t 	 hose 	 	hard	 time 	 s 	 	.
to	make	a	long	story	short	,	the	 gentle 	 man 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 	,	great	suit	and	tie	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	him	what	i	thought	was	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	and	 explain 	 ed 	 	how	hard	and	difficult	the	war	will	be	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	 under 	 estimate 	 d 	 	the	 atro 	 cities 	 	,	i	have	to	admit	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	after	that	whole	,	big	,	long	 explan 	 ation 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	question	he	had	for	me	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	joke	--	is	,	are	we	 pay 	 ing 	 	 royal 	 ties 	 	after	we	 broad 	 cast 	 	music	of	michael	jackson	?
that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	question	he	had	.
he	left	,	and	i	remember	 be 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	at	 my 	 self 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	there	must	be	an	institution	in	the	world	that	is	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 loan 	 s 	 	to	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
it	's	so	obvious	,	straight	in	your	face	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	must	have	thought	of	it	.
 some 	 body 	 	must	have	 start 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
and	i	thought	,	i	'm	just	dumb	and	i	can	not	find	it	.
you	know	,	in	my	defense	,	there	was	no	google	at	that	time	;	you	could	not	just	google	in	'91	.
so	i	thought	that	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	my	problem	.
now	we	go	from	here	,	fast	forward	to	1995	.
i	have	--	i	left	the	country	,	i	have	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	george	soros	,	 try 	 ing 	 	for	the	third	time	to	 con 	 vince 	 	him	that	his	 found 	 ation 	 	should	invest	in	 some 	 thing 	 	that	should	 oper 	 ate 	 	like	a	media	bank	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	i	was	 say 	 ing 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
you	know	,	forget	about	 char 	 ity 	 	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
forget	about	 hand 	 out 	 s 	 	;	20,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	do	not	help	 any 	 body 	 	.
what	you	should	do	is	you	should	treat	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	business	.
it	's	business	 any 	 where 	 	.
media	business	,	or	any	other	business	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 capital 	 ized 	 	.
and	what	these	 guy 	 s 	 	need	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	access	to	capital	.
so	third	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	 argument 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	 exercis 	 ed 	 	.
at	the	end	of	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	look	,	it	is	not	going	to	work	;	you	will	never	see	your	money	back	;	but	my	 found 	 ations 	 	will	put	500,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	so	you	can	test	the	idea	.
see	that	it	will	not	work	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	'll	give	you	a	rope	to	hang	 your 	 self 	 	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	after	that	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
first	,	under	no	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	i	want	to	hang	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	second	,	that	i	have	no	idea	how	to	make	it	work	.
you	see	,	at	the	level	of	a	 con 	 cept 	 	,	it	was	a	great	 con 	 cept 	 	.
but	it	's	one	thing	to	have	a	 con 	 cept 	 	;	it	's	a	 total 	 ly 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	thing	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	it	work	.
so	i	had	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	idea	how	that	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	.
had	the	wrong	idea	;	i	thought	that	we	can	be	a	bank	.
you	see	 bank 	 s 	 	--	i	do	n't	know	if	there	are	any	 bank 	 ers 	 	over	here	;	i	 apolog 	 ize 	 	in	advance	--	but	it	's	the	best	job	in	the	world	.
you	know	,	you	find	 some 	 body 	 	who	is	 respect 	 able 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	money	.
you	give	them	more	money	;	they	 re 	 pay 	 	you	that	over	a	time	.
you	collect	interest	and	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	between	.
so	i	thought	,	why	do	n't	we	get	 in 	 to 	 	that	business	?
so	here	we	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	our	first	client	,	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.
first	 in 	 dependent 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	in	slovakia	.
the	government	cutting	them	off	from	all	the	 print 	 ing 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	in	bratislava	.
so	here	's	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 print 	 ed 	 	400	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	from	the	capital	.
it	's	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	with	a	 dead 	 line 	 	of	4	p.m	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	they	have	no	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	;	they	have	no	 lat 	 est 	 	news	;	 circul 	 ation 	 	 go 	 es 	 	down	.
it	's	a	kind	of	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	,	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	way	how	to	 economic 	 ally 	 	strangle	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	.
they	come	to	us	with	a	request	for	a	loan	.
they	want	to	--	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	for	them	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	is	to	get	a	 print 	 ing 	 	press	.
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	that	's	fine	;	let	's	meet	;	you	'll	 br 	 ing 	 	us	your	business	plan	,	which	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	they	did	.
we	start	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
i	get	these	two	 piece 	 s 	 	of	paper	,	not	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	a	4	format	,	so	it	's	much	 big 	 ger 	 	.
a	lot	of	 number 	 s 	 	there	.	a	lot	of	 number 	 s 	 	.
but	 how 	 ever 	 	you	put	it	,	you	know	,	the	 number 	 s 	 	do	not	make	any	sense	.
and	that	's	the	best	they	could	do	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	the	best	that	they	could	do	.
so	that	is	how	we	 under 	 stood 	 	what	our	method	is	.
it	's	not	a	bank	.	we	had	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	 in 	 to 	 	these	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	earn	our	return	by	 fix 	 ing 	 	them	--	by	 establish 	 ing 	 	management	 system 	 s 	 	,	by	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	all	that	knowledge	,	how	do	you	run	a	business	on	one	side	--	while	they	all	know	how	to	run	,	how	to	create	content	.
just	 quick 	 ly 	 	on	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
over	these	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	40	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 afford 	 able 	 	 fin 	 anc 	 ing 	 	,	average	interest	rate	five	percent	to	six	percent	.
 late 	 ly 	 	we	are	going	wild	,	charging	seven	percent	from	time	to	time	.
we	do	it	in	17	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
and	here	is	the	most	 stunn 	 ing 	 	number	.
return	rate	--	the	one	that	soros	was	so	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	--	97	percent	.
97	percent	of	all	the	 schedule 	 d 	 	 re 	 payment 	 s 	 	came	back	to	us	on	time	.
what	do	we	 typical 	 ly 	 	finance	?
we	finance	 any 	 thing 	 	that	a	media	company	would	need	,	from	 print 	 ing 	 	 press 	 es 	 	to	 transmit 	 ter 	 s 	 	.
what	is	most	 import 	 ant 	 	is	we	do	it	either	in	form	of	 loan 	 s 	 	,	 equ 	 ities 	 	,	lease	--	 what 	 ever 	 	is	appropriate	for	,	you	know	,	 support 	 ing 	 	 any 	 body 	 	.
but	what	is	most	 import 	 ant 	 	here	is	,	who	do	we	finance	?
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	we	've	 finance 	 d 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	best	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
that	is	a	``	who	is	who	``	list	.
and	i	could	 s 	 pend 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	all	kind	of	heroes	.
and	i	can	,	but	i	'll	give	you	just	,	 may 	 be 	 	one	,	and	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	time	i	may	give	you	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	who	we	work	with	.
you	see	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	eastern	and	central	europe	,	and	 move 	 d 	 	to	russia	.
our	first	loan	in	russia	was	in	chelyabinsk	.
i	'll	bet	half	of	you	have	never	heard	of	that	place	.
in	the	south	of	russia	there	's	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	boris	nikolayevich	kirshin	,	who	is	running	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	there	.
the	city	was	closed	 un 	 til 	 	early	'90s	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	all	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	producing	glass	for	tupolev	 plane 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	he	's	running	 in 	 dependent 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	there	.
after	two	 year 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	us	,	he	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	most	 respect 	 ed 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	in	that	small	place	.
 govern 	 or 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	him	one	day	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invit 	 es 	 	him	to	come	to	his	 off 	 ice 	 	.
he	 go 	 es 	 	and	 s 	 ees 	 	the	 govern 	 or 	 	.	the	 govern 	 or 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	boris	nikolayevich	,	i	understand	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	a	great	job	,	and	you	are	the	most	 respect 	 ed 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	in	our	 di 	 strict 	 	.
and	i	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	a	deal	.
can	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	give	me	your	 news 	 paper 	 	for	the	next	nine	 month 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	 election 	 s 	 	--	there	are	 election 	 s 	 	coming	up	in	nine	 month 	 s 	 	.
i	will	not	run	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	me	who	is	going	to	succeed	me	.
so	give	me	the	paper	for	nine	 month 	 s 	 	.	i	'll	give	it	back	to	you	.
i	have	no	interest	in	 be 	 ing 	 	in	media	business	.
how	much	would	that	cost	?
boris	nikolayevich	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	it	's	not	for	sale	.	``
the	 govern 	 or 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	we	will	close	you	.	``
boris	nikolayevich	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	no	,	you	can	not	do	it	.	``
six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	the	 news 	 paper 	 	was	closed	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	we	had	 en 	 ough 	 	time	to	help	boris	nikolayevich	take	all	the	 asset 	 s 	 	out	of	that	company	and	 br 	 ing 	 	him	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	one	,	to	get	all	the	subscription	 list 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 hire 	 	staff	.
so	what	the	 govern 	 or 	 	got	was	an	empty	shell	.
but	that	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	're	in	business	of	 in 	 dependent 	 	media	,	and	if	you	are	a	 bank 	 er 	 	for	 in 	 dependent 	 	media	.
so	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	great	story	.
 some 	 where 	 	down	the	road	we	 open 	 ed 	 	a	media	management	center	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	our	media	lab	,	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	real	great	story	.
but	there	is	a	second	angle	to	that	.
the	second	angle	,	like	in	 th 	 is 	 	clip	.
if	you	take	the	camera	above	,	you	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	these	 number 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
40	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	over	10	 year 	 s 	 	spread	over	17	 count 	 ries 	 	.
that	is	not	too	much	,	is	it	?
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	a	drop	in	the	sea	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	think	about	the	 import 	 ance 	 	,	some	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	last	night	--	 th 	 is 	 	last	session	we	had	about	africa	and	his	hypothetical	50	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	destined	for	africa	.
all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	not	all	,	half	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	last	night	--	government	 account 	 ability 	 	,	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	how	do	you	fight	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	giving	voice	to	 un 	 heard 	 	,	to	poor	--	it	's	why	 in 	 dependent 	 	media	is	in	business	.
and	it	's	why	it	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
so	from	that	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	what	we	did	is	just	 re 	 ally 	 	one	drop	in	the	sea	of	that	need	that	we	can	identify	.
now	 our 	 s 	 	is	just	one	story	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	there	are	,	like	,	15	other	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 non 	 profit 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	spectacular	work	.
here	is	where	the	problem	is	,	and	i	'll	explain	to	you	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	what	the	problem	is	.
and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 fund 	 raising 	 	.
imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	third	of	 th 	 is 	 	room	is	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	people	who	represent	different	 found 	 ations 	 	.
imagine	two	 third 	 s 	 	over	here	running	 excel 	 lent 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	work	.
now	imagine	that	every	second	person	over	here	is	deaf	,	 do 	 es 	 	not	hear	,	and	 s 	 witch 	 	the	 light 	 s 	 	off	.
now	that	is	how	difficult	it	is	to	match	people	from	 th 	 is 	 	side	of	the	room	with	people	of	that	side	of	the	room	.
so	we	thought	that	some	kind	of	a	big	idea	is	 need 	 ed 	 	to	reform	,	to	 total 	 ly 	 	 re 	 think 	 	 fund 	 raising 	 	.
you	know	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	people	running	in	 th 	 is 	 	dark	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	 the 	 ir 	 	own	match	,	who	will	be	 will 	 ing 	 	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	 goal 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	all	of	that	we	thought	there	is	--	 some 	 thing 	 	new	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 is 	 suing 	 	 bond 	 s 	 	,	press	 free 	 dom 	 	 bond 	 s 	 	.
if	there	are	 invest 	 ors 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	finance	u.s.	government	budget	 defici 	 t 	 	,	why	would	n't	we	find	 invest 	 ors 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	finance	press	 free 	 dom 	 	 defici 	 t 	 	?
we	've	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	it	 th 	 is 	 	fall	;	we	will	issue	them	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	in	 denomi 	 nation 	 s 	 	of	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	to	advertise	them	too	much	;	that	's	not	the	point	.
but	the	point	is	,	if	we	ever	 surviv 	 e 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	issue	them	,	find	 en 	 ough 	 	 invest 	 ors 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	success	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 stop 	 ping 	 	the	next	 organ 	 ization 	 	to	start	to	issue	 bond 	 s 	 	next	spring	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	can	be	 environment 	 al 	 	 bond 	 s 	 	.
and	then	two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	iqbal	quadir	can	issue	his	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	bangladesh	 bond 	 s 	 	.
and	before	you	know	it	,	any	social	cause	can	be	 actual 	 ly 	 	 finance 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
now	we	do	 day 	 dream 	 ing 	 	in	11:30	with	55	 second 	 s 	 	left	.
but	let	's	take	the	idea	further	.
you	do	it	,	you	start	it	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	,	you	know	,	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	american	 mind 	 s 	 	.
but	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	europe	,	too	.
you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
you	can	,	once	you	have	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	different	 point 	 s 	 	,	you	can	make	it	easy	for	 invest 	 ors 	 	.
put	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 bond 	 s 	 	at	one	place	and	they	 s 	 it 	 	down	and	click	.
once	you	have	more	than	10	of	them	you	have	to	develop	some	kind	of	a	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
what	do	 invest 	 ors 	 	get	?
on	one	side	financial	,	on	the	other	side	social	.
so	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	idea	of	some	kind	of	rating	 age 	 ncy 	 	,	morningstar	type	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	social	impact	over	here	is	spectacular	,	five	 star 	 s 	 	.
financial	,	they	give	you	one	percent	,	 on 	 ly 	 	one	star	.
now	take	it	to	the	last	step	.
once	you	have	all	of	that	put	together	,	there	's	not	one	reason	why	you	could	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	 market 	 place 	 	for	all	of	that	,	where	you	can	not	 dispos 	 e 	 	of	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 bond 	 s 	 	in	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	quick	way	.
and	in	that	way	you	organize	the	 fin 	 anc 	 ing 	 	so	there	are	no	dark	rooms	,	no	blind	people	running	around	to	find	each	other	.
thank	you	.
