well	after	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	trade	and	 economic 	 s 	 	,	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	front	lines	of	human	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.
and	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	people	are	 fight 	 ing 	 	every	day	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	and	ca	n't	even	obtain	a	meal	.
 th 	 is 	 	red	cup	 come 	 s 	 	from	rwanda	from	a	child	named	fabian	.
and	i	carry	 th 	 is 	 	around	 a 	 s 	 	a	symbol	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	of	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	hope	.
 be 	 cause 	 	one	cup	of	food	a	day	 change 	 s 	 	fabian	's	life	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
but	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	the	fact	that	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	about	a	billion	people	on	earth	--	or	one	out	of	every	seven	--	 wok 	 e 	 	up	and	did	n't	even	know	how	to	fill	 th 	 is 	 	cup	.
one	out	of	every	seven	people	.
first	,	i	'll	ask	you	:	why	should	you	care	?
why	should	we	care	?
for	most	people	,	if	they	think	about	 hung 	 er 	 	,	they	do	n't	have	to	go	far	back	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	family	 histo 	 ry 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 live 	 s 	 	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	'	 live 	 s 	 	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	'	 live 	 s 	 	--	to	remember	an	experience	of	 hung 	 er 	 	.
i	 rare 	 ly 	 	find	an	audience	where	people	can	go	back	 ver 	 y 	 	far	 with 	 out 	 	that	experience	.
some	are	driven	by	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	feel	it	's	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	one	of	the	fundamental	 act 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	gandhi	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	to	a	 hung 	 ry 	 	man	,	a	piece	of	bread	is	the	face	of	god	.	``
 other 	 s 	 	worry	about	peace	and	security	,	 st 	 ability 	 	in	the	world	.
we	saw	the	food	 riot 	 s 	 	in	2008	,	after	what	i	call	the	silent	tsunami	of	 hung 	 er 	 	 s 	 wept 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	when	food	 price 	 s 	 	 double 	 d 	 	 over 	 night 	 	.
the	 de 	 stabil 	 izing 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 hung 	 er 	 	are	known	 through 	 out 	 	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
one	of	the	most	fundamental	 act 	 s 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	is	to	ensure	people	can	get	 en 	 ough 	 	food	.
 other 	 s 	 	think	about	malthusian	 nightmare 	 s 	 	.
will	we	be	able	to	feed	a	population	that	will	be	nine	billion	in	just	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 negoti 	 able 	 	thing	,	 hung 	 er 	 	.
people	have	to	eat	.
there	's	going	to	be	a	lot	of	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 job 	 s 	 	and	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	all	the	way	up	and	down	the	value	chain	.
but	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	came	to	 th 	 is 	 	issue	in	a	different	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	me	and	my	three	children	.
in	1987	,	i	was	a	new	mother	with	my	first	child	and	was	 hold 	 ing 	 	her	and	 feed 	 ing 	 	her	when	an	image	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	 th 	 is 	 	came	on	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	yet	 an 	 other 	 	famine	in	ethiopia	.
one	two	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	had	 kill 	 ed 	 	more	than	a	million	people	.
but	it	never	 s 	 truck 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	it	did	that	moment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	on	that	image	was	a	woman	 try 	 ing 	 	to	nurse	her	baby	,	and	she	had	no	milk	to	nurse	.
and	the	baby	's	cry	 re 	 ally 	 	 penetrate 	 d 	 	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	mother	.
and	i	thought	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	 haunt 	 ing 	 	than	the	cry	of	a	child	that	can	not	be	 return 	 ed 	 	with	food	--	the	most	fundamental	 expect 	 ation 	 	of	every	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	was	at	that	moment	that	i	just	was	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	the	 out 	 rage 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	know	how	to	fix	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	rare	 disease 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	have	the	solution	for	.
we	know	how	to	fix	 hung 	 er 	 	.
a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	did	n't	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	the	technology	and	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	just	 s 	 truck 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	out	of	place	.
at	our	time	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	these	 image 	 s 	 	are	out	of	place	.
well	guess	what	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	last	week	in	 north 	 ern 	 	kenya	.
yet	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	face	of	 starv 	 ation 	 	at	large	scale	with	more	than	nine	million	people	 wonder 	 ing 	 	if	they	can	make	it	to	the	next	day	.
in	fact	,	what	we	know	now	is	that	every	10	 second 	 s 	 	we	lose	a	child	to	 hung 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	more	than	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	,	malaria	and	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	.
and	we	know	that	the	issue	is	not	just	production	of	food	.
one	of	my	 mentor 	 s 	 	in	life	was	norman	borlaug	,	my	hero	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	access	to	food	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	and	last	year	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	2008	food	crisis	,	there	was	 en 	 ough 	 	food	on	earth	for	 every 	 one 	 	to	have	2,700	 kilo 	 calorie 	 s 	 	.
so	why	is	it	that	we	have	a	billion	people	who	ca	n't	find	food	?
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	talk	about	what	i	call	our	new	burden	of	knowledge	.
in	2008	,	 lance 	 t 	 	 compil 	 ed 	 	all	the	research	and	put	forward	the	 compel 	 ling 	 	evidence	that	if	a	child	in	 it 	 s 	 	first	thousand	 day 	 s 	 	--	from	conception	to	two	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	 ad 	 equate 	 	nutrition	,	the	damage	is	 ir 	 revers 	 ible 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	and	bodies	will	be	 stunt 	 ed 	 	.
and	here	you	see	a	brain	 s 	 can 	 	of	two	children	--	one	who	had	 ad 	 equate 	 	nutrition	,	 an 	 other 	 	,	 neglect 	 ed 	 	and	who	was	 deep 	 ly 	 	 mal 	 nourish 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	can	see	brain	 volume 	 s 	 	up	to	40	percent	less	in	these	children	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	slide	you	see	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	the	 synapse 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	do	n't	form	.
and	what	we	know	now	is	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	impact	on	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	which	i	'll	talk	about	 lat 	 er 	 	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	the	 earn 	 ing 	 	potential	of	these	children	is	cut	in	half	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 time 	 	due	to	the	 stunt 	 ing 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	in	early	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	burden	of	knowledge	 drive 	 s 	 	me	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	know	how	to	fix	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	.
and	yet	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	a	third	of	the	children	,	by	the	time	they	're	three	 al 	 ready 	 	are	facing	a	life	of	 hard 	 ship 	 	due	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	talk	about	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	on	the	front	lines	of	 hung 	 er 	 	,	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	my	economic	and	trade	knowledge	and	my	experience	in	the	private	sector	.
i	'd	like	to	talk	about	where	the	gap	of	knowledge	is	.
well	first	,	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	the	 old 	 est 	 	 nutrition 	 al 	 	method	on	earth	,	 breast 	 feed 	 ing 	 	.
you	may	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	know	that	a	child	could	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	every	22	 second 	 s 	 	if	there	was	 breast 	 feed 	 ing 	 	in	the	first	six	 month 	 s 	 	of	life	.
but	in	niger	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	less	than	seven	percent	of	the	children	are	 breast 	 fed 	 	for	the	first	six	 month 	 s 	 	of	life	,	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	.
in	mauritania	,	less	than	three	percent	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	can	be	 transform 	 ed 	 	with	knowledge	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	word	,	can	come	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	business	;	it	's	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	way	of	saving	your	child	's	life	.
and	so	 to 	 day 	 	we	focus	on	not	just	 pass 	 ing 	 	out	food	,	but	making	 s 	 ure 	 	the	 mother 	 s 	 	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 enrich 	 ment 	 	,	and	 teach 	 ing 	 	them	about	 breast 	 feed 	 ing 	 	.
the	second	thing	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	:	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	living	in	a	remote	village	 some 	 where 	 	,	your	child	was	 l 	 imp 	 	,	and	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	drought	,	or	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	 flood 	 s 	 	,	or	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	there	was	n't	 ad 	 equate 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	diet	,	what	would	you	do	?
do	you	think	you	could	go	to	the	store	and	get	a	choice	of	power	 bar 	 s 	 	,	like	we	can	,	and	pick	the	right	one	to	match	?
well	i	find	 parent 	 s 	 	out	on	the	front	lines	 ver 	 y 	 	aware	 the 	 ir 	 	children	are	going	down	for	the	count	.
and	i	go	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 shop 	 s 	 	,	if	there	are	any	,	or	out	to	the	 field 	 s 	 	to	see	what	they	can	get	,	and	they	can	not	obtain	the	nutrition	.
even	if	they	know	what	they	need	to	do	,	it	's	not	 avail 	 able 	 	.
and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	one	thing	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	is	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	in	the	food	industry	to	be	 avail 	 able 	 	for	 tradition 	 al 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	made	with	 chick 	 pea 	 s 	 	,	dried	milk	and	a	host	of	 vita 	 min 	 s 	 	,	 match 	 ed 	 	to	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	brain	 need 	 s 	 	.
it	 cost 	 s 	 	17	 cent 	 s 	 	for	us	to	produce	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	what	i	call	,	food	for	 human 	 ity 	 	.
we	did	 th 	 is 	 	with	food	 techno 	 logists 	 	in	india	and	pakistan	--	 re 	 ally 	 	about	three	of	them	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 transform 	 ing 	 	99	percent	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	who	get	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	package	,	17	 cent 	 s 	 	a	day	--	 the 	 ir 	 	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	is	 over 	 come 	 	.
so	i	am	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	if	we	can	 un 	 lock 	 	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	are	 common 	 place 	 	in	the	 rich 	 er 	 	world	to	be	able	to	transform	 food 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	climate	-	proof	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	be	 refrige 	 rated 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	water	,	which	is	often	 lack 	 ing 	 	.
and	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	i	see	,	have	the	potential	to	transform	the	face	of	 hung 	 er 	 	and	nutrition	,	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	out	on	the	front	lines	.
the	next	thing	i	want	to	talk	about	is	school	 feed 	 ing 	 	.
 eight 	 y 	 	percent	of	the	people	in	the	world	have	no	food	 safe 	 ty 	 	net	.
when	disaster	 strike 	 s 	 	--	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 get 	 s 	 	blown	,	people	lose	a	job	,	 flood 	 s 	 	,	war	,	conflict	,	bad	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	fall	back	on	.
and	 usual 	 ly 	 	the	 institution 	 s 	 	--	 church 	 es 	 	,	 temple 	 s 	 	,	other	 thing 	 s 	 	--	do	not	have	the	 resource 	 s 	 	to	provide	a	 safe 	 ty 	 	net	.
what	we	have	found	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	world	bank	is	that	the	poor	man	's	 safe 	 ty 	 	net	,	the	best	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	is	school	 feed 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	you	fill	the	cup	with	local	 agricultur 	 e 	 	from	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	you	have	a	 transform 	 ative 	 	effect	.
 man 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	in	the	world	ca	n't	go	to	school	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	to	go	beg	and	find	a	meal	.
but	when	that	food	is	there	,	it	's	 transform 	 ative 	 	.
it	 cost 	 s 	 	less	than	25	 cent 	 s 	 	a	day	to	change	a	kid	's	life	.
but	what	is	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	is	the	effect	on	 girl 	 s 	 	.
in	 count 	 ries 	 	where	 girl 	 s 	 	do	n't	go	to	school	and	you	 off 	 er 	 	a	meal	to	 girl 	 s 	 	in	school	,	we	see	 enroll 	 ment 	 	rates	about	50	percent	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 boy 	 s 	 	.
we	see	a	 transform 	 ation 	 	in	 attend 	 ance 	 	by	 girl 	 s 	 	.
and	there	was	no	argument	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	incentive	.
 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	need	the	help	.
and	we	find	that	if	we	keep	 girl 	 s 	 	in	school	 lat 	 er 	 	,	they	'll	stay	in	school	 un 	 til 	 	they	're	16	,	and	wo	n't	get	married	if	there	's	food	in	school	.
or	if	they	get	an	extra	ration	of	food	at	the	end	of	the	week	--	it	 cost 	 s 	 	about	50	 cent 	 s 	 	--	will	keep	a	girl	in	school	,	and	they	'll	give	birth	to	a	 health 	 ier 	 	child	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	is	 s 	 ent 	 	generation	to	generation	.
we	know	that	there	's	boom	and	bust	 cycle 	 s 	 	of	 hung 	 er 	 	.
we	know	 th 	 is 	 	.
right	now	on	the	horn	of	africa	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	before	.
so	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	 hope 	 less 	 	cause	?
 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	.
i	'd	like	to	talk	about	what	i	call	our	 ware 	 house 	 s 	 	for	hope	.
cameroon	,	 north 	 ern 	 	cameroon	,	boom	and	bust	 cycle 	 s 	 	of	 hung 	 er 	 	every	year	for	 decade 	 s 	 	.
food	aid	coming	in	every	year	when	people	are	 starv 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	lean	 season 	 s 	 	.
well	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	,	let	's	transform	the	model	of	 fight 	 ing 	 	 hung 	 er 	 	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	giving	out	the	food	aid	,	we	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	food	 bank 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	listen	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	lean	season	,	take	the	food	out	.
you	manage	,	the	village	 manage 	 s 	 	these	 ware 	 house 	 s 	 	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	harvest	,	put	it	back	with	interest	,	food	interest	.
so	add	in	five	percent	,	10	percent	more	food	.
for	the	past	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	500	of	these	 village 	 s 	 	where	these	are	have	not	 need 	 ed 	 	any	food	aid	--	they	're	self	-	sufficient	.
and	the	food	 bank 	 s 	 	are	growing	.
and	they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	school	 feed 	 ing 	 	 program 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	children	by	the	people	in	the	village	.
but	they	've	never	had	the	ability	to	build	even	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	or	the	 resource 	 s 	 	.
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	came	from	the	village	level	:	three	 key 	 s 	 	to	 un 	 lock 	 	that	 ware 	 house 	 	.
food	is	gold	there	.
and	simple	 idea 	 s 	 	can	transform	the	face	,	not	of	small	 area 	 s 	 	,	of	big	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
i	'd	like	to	talk	about	what	i	call	digital	food	.
technology	is	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	face	of	food	 vulner 	 ability 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	see	classic	famine	.
amartya	sen	won	his	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	for	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	guess	what	,	 famine 	 s 	 	happen	in	the	presence	of	food	 be 	 cause 	 	people	have	no	ability	to	buy	it	.	``
we	 certain 	 ly 	 	saw	that	in	2008	.
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	that	now	in	the	horn	of	africa	where	food	 price 	 s 	 	are	up	240	percent	in	some	 area 	 s 	 	over	last	year	.
food	can	be	there	and	people	ca	n't	buy	it	.
well	 th 	 is 	 	picture	--	i	was	in	hebron	in	a	small	shop	,	 th 	 is 	 	shop	,	where	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	food	,	we	provide	digital	food	,	a	card	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	``	bon	appetit	``	in	arabic	.
and	the	women	can	go	in	and	 s 	 wipe 	 	and	get	nine	food	 item 	 s 	 	.
they	have	to	be	 nut 	 rit 	 ious 	 	,	and	they	have	to	be	 local 	 ly 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	.
and	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	year	 al 	 one 	 	is	the	 dai 	 ry 	 	industry	--	where	 th 	 is 	 	card	's	used	for	milk	and	yogurt	and	 egg 	 s 	 	and	 hum 	 mus 	 	--	the	 dai 	 ry 	 	industry	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	up	30	percent	.
the	 shop 	 keeper 	 s 	 	are	 hir 	 ing 	 	more	people	.
it	is	a	win	-	win	-	win	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	 start 	 s 	 	the	food	 eco 	 nomy 	 	moving	.
we	now	deliver	food	in	over	30	 count 	 ries 	 	over	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	,	 transform 	 ing 	 	even	the	presence	of	 refuge 	 es 	 	in	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	other	ways	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	me	is	an	idea	that	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	,	howard	buffett	and	 other 	 s 	 	have	 support 	 ed 	 	 bold 	 ly 	 	,	which	is	to	ask	the	question	:	what	if	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	looking	at	the	 hung 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	--	and	most	of	them	are	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	who	can	not	raise	 en 	 ough 	 	food	or	sell	food	to	even	support	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	--	what	if	we	view	them	 a 	 s 	 	the	solution	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	value	chain	to	fight	 hung 	 er 	 	?
what	if	from	the	women	in	africa	who	can	not	sell	any	food	--	there	's	no	 road 	 s 	 	,	there	's	no	 ware 	 house 	 s 	 	,	there	's	not	even	a	tarp	to	pick	the	food	up	with	--	what	if	we	give	the	 enabl 	 ing 	 	environment	for	them	to	provide	the	food	to	feed	the	 hung 	 ry 	 	children	 else 	 where 	 	?
and	 pur 	 chasing 	 	for	progress	 to 	 day 	 	is	in	21	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	guess	what	?
in	 virtual 	 ly 	 	every	case	,	when	poor	 farm 	 ers 	 	are	 give 	 n 	 	a	 guarantee 	 d 	 	market	--	if	you	say	,	``	we	will	buy	300	metric	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	'll	pick	it	up	.	we	'll	make	 s 	 ure 	 	it	's	 store 	 d 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.	``	--	 the 	 ir 	 	 yield 	 s 	 	have	gone	up	two	-	,	three	-	,	 four 	 fold 	 	and	they	figure	it	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	first	 guarantee 	 d 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	they	've	had	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
and	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	people	transform	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	food	aid	,	our	food	aid	--	huge	engine	--	80	percent	of	it	is	 b 	 ought 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
total	 transform 	 ation 	 	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	transform	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	that	need	the	food	.
now	you	'd	ask	,	can	 th 	 is 	 	be	 d 	 one 	 	at	scale	?
these	are	great	 idea 	 s 	 	,	village	-	level	 idea 	 s 	 	.
well	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	brazil	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	taken	a	journey	to	brazil	over	the	past	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	when	i	read	that	brazil	was	 defeat 	 ing 	 	 hung 	 er 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	any	nation	on	earth	right	now	.
and	what	i	've	found	is	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 invest 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	money	in	food	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	a	school	 feed 	 ing 	 	program	.
and	they	 requir 	 e 	 	that	a	third	of	that	food	come	from	the	 small 	 est 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	who	would	have	no	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	at	huge	scale	after	 p 	 resident 	 	lula	 declare 	 d 	 	his	goal	of	 en 	 sur 	 ing 	 	 every 	 one 	 	had	three	 meal 	 s 	 	a	day	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	zero	 hung 	 er 	 	program	 cost 	 s 	 	.5	percent	of	gdp	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 lift 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	out	of	 hung 	 er 	 	and	poverty	.
it	is	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	face	of	 hung 	 er 	 	in	brazil	,	and	it	's	at	scale	,	and	it	's	creating	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
i	've	gone	out	there	;	i	've	met	with	the	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	who	have	built	 the 	 ir 	 	 livelihood 	 s 	 	on	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	platform	 provide 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	if	we	look	at	the	economic	 imper 	 ative 	 	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	just	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
the	fact	is	 stud 	 ies 	 	show	that	the	cost	of	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	and	 hung 	 er 	 	--	the	cost	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	the	burden	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	bear	--	is	on	average	six	percent	,	and	in	some	 count 	 ries 	 	up	to	11	percent	,	of	gdp	a	year	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	36	 count 	 ries 	 	with	the	highest	burden	of	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	,	that	's	260	billion	lost	from	a	productive	 eco 	 nomy 	 	every	year	.
well	,	the	world	bank	 estimate 	 s 	 	it	would	take	about	10	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	10.3	--	to	address	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
you	look	at	the	cost	-	benefit	analysis	,	and	my	dream	is	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	issue	,	not	just	from	the	 compass 	 ion 	 	argument	,	but	to	the	finance	 mini 	 sters 	 	of	the	world	,	and	say	we	can	not	afford	to	not	invest	in	the	access	to	 ad 	 equate 	 	,	 afford 	 able 	 	nutrition	for	all	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	i	've	found	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	can	change	on	a	big	scale	 with 	 out 	 	the	 determi 	 nation 	 	of	a	 lead 	 er 	 	.
when	a	 lead 	 er 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	not	under	my	watch	,	``	 every 	 thing 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	to	change	.
and	the	world	can	come	in	with	 enabl 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	and	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	fact	that	france	 ha 	 s 	 	put	food	at	the	center	of	the	g	20	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	food	is	one	issue	that	can	not	be	 solve 	 d 	 	person	by	person	,	nation	by	nation	.
we	have	to	stand	together	.
and	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
wfp	's	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 leav 	 e 	 	30	 nation 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	face	of	 hung 	 er 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
what	i	would	like	to	 off 	 er 	 	here	is	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	're	living	at	a	time	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	where	it	's	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	that	children	wake	up	and	do	n't	know	where	to	find	a	cup	of	food	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	 transform 	 ing 	 	 hung 	 er 	 	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	but	i	think	we	have	to	change	our	 mind 	 set 	 s 	 	.
i	am	so	 honor 	 ed 	 	to	be	here	with	some	of	the	world	's	top	 innov 	 ators 	 	and	 think 	 ers 	 	.
and	i	would	like	you	to	join	with	all	of	 human 	 ity 	 	to	draw	a	line	in	the	sand	and	say	,	``	no	more	.
no	more	are	we	going	to	accept	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	we	want	to	tell	our	 grand 	 children 	 	that	there	was	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	time	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	where	up	to	a	third	of	the	children	had	 brain 	 s 	 	and	bodies	that	 we 	 re 	 	 stunt 	 ed 	 	,	but	that	 exist 	 s 	 	no	more	.
thank	you	.
