so	,	can	we	 da 	 re 	 	to	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	?
well	,	the	thesis	of	``	the	bottom	billion	``	is	that	a	billion	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	living	in	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 stag 	 nant 	 	for	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 h 	 ence 	 	 div 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	the	rest	of	 man 	 kind 	 	.
and	so	,	the	real	question	to	pose	is	not	,	``	can	we	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	?	``
it	's	,	``	how	can	we	give	credible	hope	to	that	billion	people	?	``
that	,	to	my	mind	,	is	the	fundamental	 challeng 	 e 	 	now	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
what	i	'm	going	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	is	a	recipe	,	a	combination	of	the	two	 force 	 s 	 	that	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	for	good	,	which	is	the	alliance	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	self	-	interest	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	billion	people	are	living	in	 socie 	 ties 	 	that	have	not	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	credible	hope	.
that	is	a	human	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
 enlighten 	 ed 	 	self	-	interest	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	that	economic	 diverge 	 nce 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	for	 an 	 other 	 	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	 combine 	 d 	 	with	social	 integ 	 ration 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	,	it	will	build	a	nightmare	for	our	children	.
we	need	 compass 	 ion 	 	to	get	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	self	-	interest	to	get	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	serious	.
that	's	the	alliance	that	 change 	 s 	 	the	world	.
so	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	to	get	serious	about	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	hope	for	the	bottom	billion	?
what	can	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	?
well	,	a	good	guide	is	to	think	,	``	what	did	we	do	last	time	the	rich	world	got	serious	about	 develop 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	region	of	the	world	?	``
that	 give 	 s 	 	us	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	good	clue	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	you	have	to	go	back	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	time	.
the	last	time	the	rich	world	got	serious	about	 develop 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	region	was	in	the	late	1940s	.
the	rich	world	was	you	,	america	,	and	the	region	that	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	 develop 	 ed 	 	was	my	world	,	europe	.
that	was	post	-	war	europe	.
why	did	america	get	serious	?
it	was	n't	just	 compass 	 ion 	 	for	europe	,	 th 	 ough 	 	there	was	that	.
it	was	that	you	 k 	 new 	 	you	had	to	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	the	late	1940s	,	country	after	country	in	central	europe	was	 fall 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	soviet	 b 	 loc 	 	,	and	so	you	 k 	 new 	 	you	'd	no	choice	.
europe	had	to	be	 drag 	 ged 	 	 in 	 to 	 	economic	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
so	,	what	did	you	do	,	last	time	you	got	serious	?
well	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	had	a	big	aid	program	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
that	was	marshall	aid	:	we	need	to	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.	aid	is	part	of	the	solution	.
but	what	else	did	you	do	?
well	,	you	 to 	 re 	 	up	your	trade	policy	,	and	 total 	 ly 	 	 revers 	 ed 	 	it	.
before	the	war	,	america	had	 be 	 en 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 ist 	 	.
after	the	war	,	you	 open 	 ed 	 	your	 market 	 s 	 	to	europe	,	you	 drag 	 ged 	 	europe	 in 	 to 	 	the	then	-	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	which	was	your	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	you	 institution 	 al 	 ized 	 	that	trade	 liberal 	 ization 	 	through	 found 	 ing 	 	the	general	 agree 	 ment 	 	on	 ta 	 riff 	 s 	 	and	trade	.
so	,	total	 revers 	 al 	 	of	trade	policy	.
did	you	do	 any 	 thing 	 	else	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	you	 total 	 ly 	 	 revers 	 ed 	 	your	security	policy	.
before	the	war	,	your	security	policy	had	 be 	 en 	 	 isol 	 ation 	 ist 	 	.
after	the	war	,	you	tear	that	up	,	you	put	100,000	 troop 	 s 	 	in	europe	for	over	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	total	 revers 	 al 	 	of	security	policy	.	 any 	 thing 	 	else	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	you	tear	up	the	``	 eleven 	 th 	 	 command 	 ment 	 	``	--	national	 sovereign 	 ty 	 	.
before	the	war	,	you	 treat 	 ed 	 	national	 sovereign 	 ty 	 	 a 	 s 	 	so	 sac 	 ro 	 sanct 	 	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	even	 will 	 ing 	 	to	join	the	league	of	 nation 	 s 	 	.
after	the	war	,	you	found	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	you	found	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	for	economic	 co 	 operation 	 	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	you	found	the	imf	,	you	 encourag 	 ed 	 	europe	to	create	the	european	community	--	all	 system 	 s 	 	for	mutual	government	support	.
that	is	still	the	 water 	 front 	 	of	effective	 poli 	 cies 	 	:	aid	,	trade	,	security	,	 government 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	policy	are	going	to	be	different	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	different	.
it	's	not	 re 	 building 	 	europe	,	it	's	 revers 	 ing 	 	the	 diverge 	 nce 	 	for	the	bottom	billion	,	so	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	catch	up	.
is	that	 eas 	 ier 	 	or	 hard 	 er 	 	?
we	need	to	be	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	serious	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	then	.
now	,	 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	take	just	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	four	.
i	'm	going	to	take	the	one	that	 sound 	 s 	 	the	 weak 	 est 	 	,	the	one	that	's	just	 mother 	 hood 	 	and	apple	pie	--	 government 	 s 	 	,	mutual	 system 	 s 	 	of	support	for	 government 	 s 	 	--	and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	one	idea	in	how	we	could	do	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 strength 	 en 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	that	that	is	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	now	.
the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	we	're	going	to	look	to	is	a	genuine	 bas 	 is 	 	for	 optim 	 ism 	 	about	the	bottom	billion	,	and	that	is	the	 commodit 	 y 	 	 boom 	 s 	 	.
the	 commodit 	 y 	 	 boom 	 s 	 	are	 pump 	 ing 	 	unprecedented	 amount 	 s 	 	of	money	 in 	 to 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	not	all	,	of	the	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	bottom	billion	.
 part 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	 pump 	 ing 	 	money	in	 be 	 cause 	 	 commodit 	 y 	 	 price 	 s 	 	are	high	,	but	it	's	not	just	that	.	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	range	of	new	 discover 	 ies 	 	.
uganda	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 discover 	 ed 	 	oil	,	in	about	the	most	 dis 	 astro 	 us 	 	location	on	earth	;	ghana	 ha 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	oil	;	guinea	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	huge	new	 exploit 	 ation 	 	of	iron	ore	coming	out	of	the	ground	.
so	,	a	mass	of	new	 discover 	 ies 	 	.
between	them	,	these	new	revenue	 flow 	 s 	 	dwarf	aid	.
just	to	give	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	angola	 al 	 one 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	50	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	in	oil	revenue	.
the	entire	aid	 flow 	 s 	 	to	the	60	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	bottom	billion	last	year	 we 	 re 	 	34	billion	.
so	,	the	flow	of	 resource 	 s 	 	from	the	 commodit 	 y 	 	 boom 	 s 	 	to	the	bottom	billion	are	 with 	 out 	 	 precede 	 nt 	 	.
so	there	's	the	 optim 	 ism 	 	.
the	question	is	,	how	is	it	going	to	help	 the 	 ir 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	?
it	's	a	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
will	it	be	taken	?
so	,	here	 come 	 s 	 	a	bit	of	science	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bit	of	science	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	since	``	the	bottom	billion	,	``	so	it	's	new	.
i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	to	see	what	is	the	relationship	between	 high 	 er 	 	 commodit 	 y 	 	 price 	 s 	 	of	 export 	 s 	 	,	and	the	growth	of	 commodit 	 y 	 	-	 export 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	taken	all	the	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	for	the	last	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 look 	 ed 	 	to	see	what	the	relationship	is	.
and	the	short	run	--	say	,	the	first	five	to	seven	 year 	 s 	 	--	is	just	great	.
in	fact	,	it	's	 hunk 	 y 	 	 d 	 ory 	 	:	 every 	 thing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	.
you	get	more	money	 be 	 cause 	 	your	 term 	 s 	 	of	trade	have	 improv 	 ed 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	that	 drive 	 s 	 	up	 out 	 put 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	.
so	gdp	 go 	 es 	 	up	a	lot	--	fantastic	!	that	's	the	short	run	.
and	how	about	the	long	run	?
come	back	15	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
well	,	the	short	run	,	it	's	 hunk 	 y 	 	 d 	 ory 	 	,	but	the	long	run	,	it	's	 hump 	 ty 	 	 dump 	 ty 	 	.
you	go	up	in	the	short	run	,	but	then	most	 socie 	 ties 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	have	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	if	they	'd	had	no	 boom 	 s 	 	at	all	.
that	is	not	a	 fore 	 cast 	 	about	how	 commodit 	 y 	 	 price 	 s 	 	go	;	it	's	a	 fore 	 cast 	 	of	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	,	the	long	-	term	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	,	for	growth	of	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 price 	 s 	 	.
so	,	what	 go 	 es 	 	wrong	?	why	is	there	 th 	 is 	 	``	resource	curse	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	?
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	that	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	critical	issue	is	the	level	of	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	the	 initi 	 al 	 	level	of	economic	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	when	the	resource	 boom 	 s 	 	accrue	.
in	fact	,	if	you	've	got	good	 en 	 ough 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	there	is	no	resource	boom	.
you	go	up	in	the	short	term	,	and	then	you	go	up	even	more	in	the	long	term	.
that	's	norway	,	the	 rich 	 est 	 	country	in	europe	.	it	's	australia	.	it	's	canada	.
the	resource	curse	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	to	 count 	 ries 	 	 be 	 low 	 	a	threshold	of	 govern 	 ance 	 	.
they	still	go	up	in	the	short	run	.
that	's	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	bottom	billion	at	the	moment	.
the	best	growth	rates	they	've	had	--	ever	.
and	the	question	is	 whet 	 her 	 	the	short	run	will	persist	.
and	with	bad	 govern 	 ance 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	over	the	last	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	.
it	's	 count 	 ries 	 	like	nigeria	,	which	are	 wo 	 rse 	 	off	than	if	they	'd	never	had	oil	.
so	,	there	's	a	threshold	level	above	which	you	go	up	in	the	long	term	,	and	 be 	 low 	 	which	you	go	down	.
just	to	 bench 	 mark 	 	that	threshold	,	it	's	about	the	 govern 	 ance 	 	level	of	portugal	in	the	mid	1980s	.
so	,	the	question	is	,	are	the	bottom	billion	above	or	 be 	 low 	 	that	threshold	?
now	,	there	's	one	big	change	since	the	 commodit 	 y 	 	 boom 	 s 	 	of	the	1970s	,	and	that	is	the	spread	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
so	i	thought	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	is	the	thing	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	in	the	bottom	billion	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	can	be	more	 optimist 	 ic 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	spread	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
so	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	.	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 do 	 es 	 	have	significant	 effect 	 s 	 	--	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	 advers 	 e 	 	.
 demo 	 cracies 	 	make	even	more	of	a	mess	of	these	resource	 boom 	 s 	 	than	 auto 	 cracies 	 	.
at	that	stage	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	abandon	the	research	,	but	--	--	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	a	little	bit	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	that	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	two	distinct	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	:	there	's	 elect 	 or 	 al 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	,	which	 determine 	 s 	 	how	you	 acquir 	 e 	 	power	,	and	there	are	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	,	which	determine	how	you	use	power	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 elect 	 or 	 al 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	is	the	thing	that	's	 do 	 ing 	 	the	damage	with	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	strong	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	make	resource	 boom 	 s 	 	good	.
and	so	,	what	the	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	bottom	billion	need	is	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	.
they	have	n't	got	them	.
they	got	instant	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	the	1990s	:	 election 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	.
how	can	we	help	improve	 govern 	 ance 	 	and	 introduc 	 e 	 	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	?
in	all	the	 socie 	 ties 	 	of	the	bottom	billion	,	there	are	 intens 	 e 	 	 struggle 	 s 	 	to	do	just	that	.
the	simple	proposal	is	that	we	should	have	some	 inter 	 national 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	,	which	will	be	voluntary	,	but	which	would	spell	out	the	key	decision	 point 	 s 	 	that	need	to	be	taken	in	order	to	harness	these	resource	 revenue 	 s 	 	.
we	know	these	 inter 	 national 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	work	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	got	one	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 extr 	 active 	 	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	.
that	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	idea	that	 government 	 s 	 	should	report	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	what	 revenue 	 s 	 	they	have	.
no	 soon 	 er 	 	was	it	 pro 	 posed 	 	than	 reform 	 ers 	 	in	nigeria	 adopt 	 ed 	 	it	,	 push 	 ed 	 	it	and	 publish 	 ed 	 	the	 revenue 	 s 	 	in	the	paper	.
nigerian	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	 circul 	 ations 	 	 spike 	 d 	 	.
people	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	what	 the 	 ir 	 	government	was	 get 	 ting 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	revenue	.
so	,	we	know	it	 work 	 s 	 	.	what	would	the	content	be	of	these	 inter 	 national 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	?
i	ca	n't	go	through	all	of	them	,	but	i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
the	first	is	how	to	take	the	 resource 	 s 	 	out	of	the	ground	--	the	economic	 process 	 es 	 	,	taking	the	 resource 	 s 	 	out	of	the	ground	and	 put 	 ting 	 	 asset 	 s 	 	on	top	of	the	ground	.
and	the	first	step	in	that	is	selling	the	 right 	 s 	 	to	resource	 extra 	 ction 	 	.
you	know	how	 right 	 s 	 	to	resource	 extra 	 ction 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	at	the	moment	,	how	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 old 	 	over	the	last	40	 year 	 s 	 	?
a	company	flies	in	,	 do 	 es 	 	a	deal	with	a	 mini 	 ster 	 	.
and	that	's	great	for	the	company	,	and	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	often	great	for	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	--	--	and	it	's	not	great	for	 the 	 ir 	 	country	.
there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 institution 	 al 	 	technology	which	can	transform	that	,	and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 ified 	 	 auction 	 s 	 	.
the	public	 age 	 ncy 	 	with	the	 great 	 est 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	on	earth	is	of	course	the	 treasu 	 ry 	 	--	that	is	,	the	british	 treasu 	 ry 	 	.
and	the	british	 treasu 	 ry 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	that	it	would	sell	the	 right 	 s 	 	to	third	-	generation	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	by	 work 	 ing 	 	out	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 right 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	worth	.
they	 work 	 ed 	 	out	they	 we 	 re 	 	worth	two	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	.
just	in	time	,	a	set	of	 economist 	 s 	 	got	there	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	not	try	an	auction	?	it	'll	reveal	the	value	.	``
it	went	for	20	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	through	auction	.
if	the	british	 treasu 	 ry 	 	can	be	out	by	a	factor	of	10	,	think	what	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	finance	in	sierra	leone	is	going	to	be	like	.
when	i	put	that	to	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	sierra	leone	,	the	next	day	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	world	bank	to	 s 	 end 	 	him	a	team	to	give	 expert 	 ise 	 	on	how	to	conduct	 auction 	 s 	 	.
there	are	five	 s 	 uch 	 	decision	 point 	 s 	 	;	each	one	 need 	 s 	 	an	 inter 	 national 	 	standard	.
if	we	could	do	it	,	we	would	change	the	world	.
we	would	be	 help 	 ing 	 	the	 reform 	 ers 	 	in	these	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	who	are	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	for	change	.
that	's	our	modest	role	.	we	can	not	change	these	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	but	we	can	help	the	people	in	these	 socie 	 ties 	 	who	are	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	and	 usual 	 ly 	 	 fail 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 odd 	 s 	 	are	so	 stack 	 ed 	 	against	them	.
and	yet	,	we	've	not	got	these	 rule 	 s 	 	.
if	you	think	about	it	,	the	cost	of	 promulg 	 ating 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	is	zilch	--	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
why	on	earth	are	they	not	there	?
i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	reason	they	're	not	there	is	that	 un 	 til 	 	we	have	a	critical	mass	of	 inform 	 ed 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	in	our	own	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	 politic 	 ians 	 	will	get	away	with	 gest 	 ures 	 	.
that	 un 	 less 	 	we	have	an	 inform 	 ed 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	what	 politic 	 ians 	 	do	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	relation	to	africa	,	is	 gest 	 ures 	 	:	 thing 	 s 	 	that	look	good	,	but	do	n't	work	.
and	so	i	 real 	 ized 	 	we	had	to	go	through	the	business	of	building	an	 inform 	 ed 	 	 citizen 	 ry 	 	.
that	's	why	i	broke	all	the	professional	 rule 	 s 	 	of	conduct	for	an	economist	,	and	i	wrote	an	 economic 	 s 	 	book	that	you	could	read	on	a	beach	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	have	to	say	,	the	process	of	communication	 do 	 es 	 	not	come	 natural 	 ly 	 	to	me	.
