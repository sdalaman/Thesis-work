i	would	like	to	share	with	you	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	some	 st 	 ories 	 	about	the	ocean	through	my	work	 a 	 s 	 	a	still	 photograph 	 er 	 	for	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	magazine	.
i	guess	i	 be 	 came 	 	an	 under 	 water 	 	 photograph 	 er 	 	and	a	 photo 	 journalist 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	fell	in	love	with	the	sea	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	about	all	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	i	was	 see 	 ing 	 	 under 	 water 	 	,	 in 	 credible 	 	 wild 	 life 	 	and	 interest 	 ing 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
and	after	even	30	 year 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	after	30	 year 	 s 	 	of	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	ocean	,	i	never	cease	to	be	 amaz 	 ed 	 	at	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	that	i	have	while	i	'm	at	sea	.
but	more	and	more	 frequent 	 ly 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 under 	 water 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	do	n't	think	most	people	 real 	 ize 	 	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 compel 	 led 	 	to	turn	my	camera	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	these	 issue 	 s 	 	to	tell	a	more	complete	story	.
i	want	people	to	see	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 under 	 water 	 	,	both	the	 horr 	 or 	 	and	the	magic	.
the	first	story	that	i	did	for	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	,	where	i	 recogn 	 ized 	 	the	ability	to	include	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	 cover 	 age 	 	,	was	a	story	i	 pro 	 posed 	 	on	harp	 seal 	 s 	 	.
the	story	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 initi 	 ally 	 	was	just	a	small	focus	to	look	at	the	few	 week 	 s 	 	each	year	where	these	 animal 	 s 	 	 migr 	 ate 	 	down	from	the	canadian	 arc 	 tic 	 	to	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	st.	lawrence	in	canada	to	engage	in	 court 	 ship 	 	,	 mat 	 ing 	 	and	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 pup 	 s 	 	.
and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 play 	 ed 	 	out	against	the	 back 	 drop 	 	of	 trans 	 ient 	 	pack	ice	that	 move 	 s 	 	with	wind	and	tide	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	an	 under 	 water 	 	 photograph 	 er 	 	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	story	from	both	above	and	 be 	 low 	 	,	to	make	 picture 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	that	show	one	of	these	little	 pup 	 s 	 	making	 it 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	first	swim	in	the	 ic 	 y 	 	29	-	degree	water	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	i	got	more	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	story	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	big	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	i	could	n't	 ignor 	 e 	 	.
the	first	was	that	these	 animal 	 s 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	be	 hunt 	 ed 	 	,	 kill 	 ed 	 	with	hakapiks	at	about	eight	,	15	 day 	 s 	 	old	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	the	largest	marine	mammal	 s 	 laughter 	 	on	the	planet	,	with	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	 seal 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	every	year	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	 disturb 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	is	,	i	think	the	 big 	 ger 	 	problem	for	harp	 seal 	 s 	 	is	the	loss	of	sea	ice	due	to	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 a 	 erial 	 	picture	that	i	made	that	 show 	 s 	 	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	st.	lawrence	 dur 	 ing 	 	harp	seal	season	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	see	a	lot	of	ice	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	there	's	a	lot	of	water	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	which	was	n't	there	 historic 	 ally 	 	.
and	the	ice	that	is	there	is	 quit 	 e 	 	thin	.
the	problem	is	that	these	 pup 	 s 	 	need	a	 s 	 table 	 	platform	of	solid	ice	in	order	to	nurse	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 mom 	 s 	 	.
they	 on 	 ly 	 	need	12	 day 	 s 	 	from	the	moment	they	're	born	 un 	 til 	 	they	're	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
but	if	they	do	n't	get	12	 day 	 s 	 	,	they	can	fall	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	and	die	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photo	that	i	made	 show 	 ing 	 	one	of	these	 pup 	 s 	 	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	five	or	seven	 day 	 s 	 	old	--	still	 ha 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	of	the	 umbilic 	 al 	 	cord	on	 it 	 s 	 	 bel 	 ly 	 	--	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 fall 	 en 	 	in	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	thin	ice	,	and	the	mother	is	 fr 	 ant 	 ically 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	push	it	up	to	breathe	and	to	get	it	back	to	 s 	 table 	 	purchase	.
 th 	 is 	 	problem	 ha 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	grow	each	year	since	i	was	there	.
i	read	that	last	year	the	pup	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rate	was	100	percent	in	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	st.	lawrence	.
so	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	species	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	going	forward	.
 th 	 is 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 coming 	 	a	cover	story	at	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	.
and	it	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	of	attention	.
and	with	that	,	i	saw	the	potential	to	begin	 do 	 ing 	 	other	 st 	 ories 	 	about	ocean	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 pro 	 posed 	 	a	story	on	the	global	fish	crisis	,	in	part	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	 personal 	 ly 	 	 witness 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	degradation	in	the	ocean	over	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	read	a	scientific	paper	that	 state 	 d 	 	that	90	percent	of	the	big	fish	in	the	ocean	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	50	or	60	 year 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	tuna	,	the	 bill 	 fish 	 	and	the	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
when	i	read	that	,	i	was	blown	away	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	going	to	be	 head 	 line 	 	news	in	every	media	 out 	 let 	 	,	but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	,	so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	story	that	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	kind	of	 under 	 water 	 	story	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	be	more	like	war	 photograph 	 y 	 	,	where	i	was	making	 hard 	 er 	 	-	hitting	 picture 	 s 	 	that	 show 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ers 	 	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	marine	 wild 	 life 	 	around	the	planet	.
the	first	component	of	the	story	that	i	thought	was	essential	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	was	to	give	 read 	 ers 	 	a	sense	of	 appreci 	 ation 	 	for	the	ocean	 animal 	 s 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	eating	.
you	know	,	i	think	people	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	restaurant	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	 order 	 s 	 	a	steak	,	and	we	all	know	where	steak	 come 	 s 	 	from	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	 order 	 s 	 	a	chicken	,	and	we	know	what	a	chicken	is	,	but	when	they	're	eating	 blue 	 fin 	 	sushi	,	do	they	have	any	sense	of	the	 magnific 	 ent 	 	animal	that	they	're	 consum 	 ing 	 	?
these	are	the	 lion 	 s 	 	and	 tiger 	 s 	 	of	the	sea	.
in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	these	 animal 	 s 	 	have	no	terrestrial	 counter 	 part 	 	;	they	're	 un 	 ique 	 	in	the	world	.
these	are	 animal 	 s 	 	that	can	 practical 	 ly 	 	swim	from	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	to	the	 pole 	 s 	 	and	can	crisscross	entire	 ocean 	 s 	 	in	the	course	of	a	year	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	so	efficient	at	 catch 	 ing 	 	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	grow	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	life	,	would	have	30	-	year	-	old	 blue 	 fin 	 	out	there	that	weigh	a	ton	.
but	the	truth	is	we	're	way	too	efficient	at	 catch 	 ing 	 	them	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 stock 	 s 	 	have	 collapse 	 d 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	auction	at	the	tsukiji	fish	market	that	i	 photograph 	 ed 	 	a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	every	single	day	these	tuna	,	 blue 	 fin 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	are	 stack 	 ed 	 	up	like	 cord 	 wood 	 	,	just	 ware 	 house 	 	after	 ware 	 house 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 wander 	 ed 	 	around	and	made	these	 picture 	 s 	 	,	it	sort	of	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	the	ocean	's	not	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	,	you	know	.
we	ca	n't	keep	taking	 with 	 out 	 	 expect 	 ing 	 	serious	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	,	with	the	story	,	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	 read 	 ers 	 	how	fish	are	caught	,	some	of	the	 method 	 s 	 	that	are	used	to	catch	fish	,	like	a	bottom	 trawl 	 er 	 	,	which	is	one	of	the	most	common	 method 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	small	net	that	was	 be 	 ing 	 	used	in	mexico	to	catch	shrimp	,	but	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	same	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
you	have	a	large	net	in	the	middle	with	two	steel	 door 	 s 	 	on	either	end	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 assem 	 bly 	 	is	 tow 	 ed 	 	through	the	water	,	the	 door 	 s 	 	meet	 resist 	 ance 	 	with	the	ocean	,	and	it	 open 	 s 	 	the	mouth	of	the	net	,	and	they	place	 float 	 s 	 	at	the	top	and	a	lead	line	on	the	bottom	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	just	 drag 	 s 	 	over	the	bottom	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	to	catch	shrimp	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	it	's	 catch 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	in	 it 	 s 	 	path	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	it	's	 destroy 	 ing 	 	that	precious	 bent 	 hic 	 	community	on	the	bottom	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 sponge 	 s 	 	and	 coral 	 s 	 	,	that	critical	 habit 	 at 	 	for	other	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	photograph	i	made	of	the	 fish 	 er 	 man 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	shrimp	that	he	caught	after	 tow 	 ing 	 	his	 net 	 s 	 	for	one	hour	.
so	he	had	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	shrimp	,	 may 	 be 	 	seven	or	eight	shrimp	,	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 animal 	 s 	 	on	the	deck	of	the	boat	are	 by 	 catch 	 	.
these	are	 animal 	 s 	 	that	 di 	 ed 	 	in	the	process	,	but	have	no	commercial	value	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	true	cost	of	a	shrimp	 d 	 inner 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	seven	or	eight	shrimp	and	10	 pound 	 s 	 	of	other	 animal 	 s 	 	that	had	to	die	in	the	process	.
and	to	make	that	point	even	more	visual	,	i	swam	under	the	shrimp	boat	and	made	 th 	 is 	 	picture	of	the	guy	 shove 	 ling 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 by 	 catch 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sea	 a 	 s 	 	trash	and	 photograph 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 cascad 	 e 	 	of	death	,	you	know	,	 animal 	 s 	 	like	 guitar 	 fish 	 	,	bat	 ray 	 s 	 	,	 flo 	 under 	 	,	 puff 	 er 	 fish 	 	,	that	 on 	 ly 	 	an	hour	before	,	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	,	 al 	 ive 	 	,	but	now	 be 	 ing 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	back	 a 	 s 	 	trash	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	focus	on	the	 s 	 hark 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	industry	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 current 	 ly 	 	on	planet	earth	,	we	're	 kill 	 ing 	 	over	100	million	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	every	single	year	.
but	before	i	went	out	to	photograph	 th 	 is 	 	component	,	i	sort	of	 wrestl 	 ed 	 	with	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	how	do	you	make	a	picture	of	a	dead	 s 	 hark 	 	that	will	 reson 	 ate 	 	with	 read 	 ers 	 	you	know	,	i	think	there	's	still	a	lot	of	people	out	there	who	think	the	 on 	 ly 	 	good	 s 	 hark 	 	is	a	dead	 s 	 hark 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	in	and	found	 th 	 is 	 	thresher	that	had	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	in	the	gill	net	.
and	with	 it 	 s 	 	huge	pectoral	 fin 	 s 	 	and	 eye 	 s 	 	still	 ver 	 y 	 	visible	,	it	 s 	 truck 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	a	 crucifix 	 ion 	 	,	if	you	will	.
 th 	 is 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	the	lead	picture	in	the	global	 fish 	 ery 	 	story	in	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	.
and	i	hope	that	it	 help 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ers 	 	to	take	notice	of	 th 	 is 	 	problem	of	100	million	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	i	love	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	 some 	 what 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	--	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 an 	 other 	 	,	more	 celebr 	 atory 	 	,	story	about	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	need	for	 s 	 hark 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.
so	i	went	to	the	bahamas	 be 	 cause 	 	there	're	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	world	where	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	well	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	but	the	bahamas	seem	to	be	a	place	where	 stock 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 reason 	 ably 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	 large 	 ly 	 	due	to	the	fact	that	the	government	there	had	 out 	 law 	 ed 	 	 long 	 lining 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	species	that	we	had	n't	 show 	 n 	 	much	in	the	magazine	and	 work 	 ed 	 	in	a	number	of	 location 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 location 	 s 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	place	 call 	 ed 	 	tiger	beach	,	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	bahamas	where	tiger	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	in	 sh 	 allow 	 	water	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	low	-	altitude	photograph	that	i	made	 show 	 ing 	 	our	 d 	 ive 	 	boat	with	about	a	dozen	of	these	big	old	tiger	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	sort	of	just	 swimm 	 ing 	 	around	 be 	 hind 	 	.
but	the	one	thing	i	 definite 	 ly 	 	did	n't	want	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	 cover 	 age 	 	was	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 port 	 ray 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 mon 	 sters 	 	.
i	did	n't	want	them	to	be	 over 	 ly 	 	 threaten 	 ing 	 	or	 scar 	 y 	 	.
and	with	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	of	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	15	-	feet	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	14	-	feet	,	i	guess	,	female	tiger	 s 	 hark 	 	,	i	sort	of	think	i	got	to	that	goal	,	where	she	was	 swimm 	 ing 	 	with	these	little	 bar 	 jack 	 s 	 	off	her	nose	,	and	my	 stro 	 be 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	shadow	on	her	face	.
and	i	think	it	's	a	 gentle 	 r 	 	picture	,	a	little	less	 threaten 	 ing 	 	,	a	little	more	 respect 	 ful 	 	of	the	species	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 search 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	story	for	the	elusive	great	 hammer 	 head 	 	,	an	animal	that	 re 	 ally 	 	had	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 photograph 	 ed 	 	much	 un 	 til 	 	 may 	 be 	 	about	seven	or	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	creature	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	animal	that	's	 consider 	 ed 	 	data	 defici 	 ent 	 	by	science	in	both	florida	and	in	the	bahamas	.
you	know	,	we	know	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	them	.
we	do	n't	know	where	they	 migr 	 ate 	 	to	or	from	,	where	they	mate	,	where	they	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 pup 	 s 	 	,	and	yet	,	 hammer 	 head 	 	 population 	 s 	 	in	the	atlantic	have	 decline 	 d 	 	about	80	percent	in	the	last	20	to	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	we	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	them	 fast 	 er 	 	than	we	can	possibly	find	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ocean 	 ic 	 	 white 	 tip 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	,	an	animal	that	is	 consider 	 ed 	 	the	fourth	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	species	,	if	you	pay	attention	to	 s 	 uch 	 	 list 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	an	animal	that	's	about	98	percent	in	decline	 through 	 out 	 	most	of	 it 	 s 	 	range	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pel 	 agic 	 	animal	and	it	 live 	 s 	 	out	in	the	 deep 	 er 	 	water	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	bottom	,	i	 br 	 ought 	 	 a 	 long 	 	a	 s 	 hark 	 	cage	here	,	and	my	friend	,	 s 	 hark 	 	biologist	wes	pratt	is	 in 	 side 	 	the	cage	.
you	'll	see	that	the	 photograph 	 er 	 	,	of	course	,	was	not	 in 	 side 	 	the	cage	here	,	so	 clear 	 ly 	 	the	biologist	is	a	little	 smart 	 er 	 	than	the	 photograph 	 er 	 	i	guess	.
and	 last 	 ly 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	focus	on	baby	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 hark 	 	 nurse 	 ries 	 	.
and	i	went	to	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	bimini	,	in	the	bahamas	,	to	work	with	lemon	 s 	 hark 	 	 pup 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photo	of	a	lemon	 s 	 hark 	 	pup	,	and	it	 show 	 s 	 	these	 animal 	 s 	 	where	they	live	for	the	first	two	to	three	 year 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	in	these	 protect 	 ive 	 	 man 	 grove 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	sort	of	un	-	 s 	 hark 	 	-	like	photograph	.
it	's	not	what	you	 typical 	 ly 	 	might	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 hark 	 	picture	.
but	,	you	know	,	here	we	see	a	 s 	 hark 	 	that	's	 may 	 be 	 	10	or	11	 inch 	 es 	 	long	 swimm 	 ing 	 	in	about	a	foot	of	water	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 cruci 	 al 	 	 habit 	 at 	 	and	it	's	where	they	 s 	 pend 	 	the	first	two	,	three	 year 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	they	're	big	 en 	 ough 	 	to	go	out	on	the	rest	of	the	reef	.
after	i	left	bimini	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 habit 	 at 	 	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 bulldoze 	 d 	 	to	create	a	new	golf	course	and	resort	.
and	other	 re 	 cent 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	have	 look 	 ed 	 	at	single	,	 flag 	 ship 	 	species	,	if	you	will	,	that	are	at	risk	in	the	ocean	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	other	 threat 	 s 	 	.
one	 s 	 uch 	 	story	i	did	 document 	 ed 	 	the	 leather 	 back 	 	sea	turtle	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	largest	,	widest	-	ranging	,	 deep 	 est 	 	-	 div 	 ing 	 	and	 old 	 est 	 	of	all	turtle	species	.
here	we	see	a	female	 crawl 	 ing 	 	out	of	the	ocean	under	 moon 	 light 	 	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	trinidad	.
these	are	 animal 	 s 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 line 	 age 	 	 date 	 s 	 	back	about	100	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	there	was	a	time	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 span 	 	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	coming	out	of	the	water	to	nest	and	saw	tyrannosaurus	 r 	 ex 	 	running	by	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	they	crawl	out	and	see	 condom 	 in 	 ium 	 s 	 	.
but	 de 	 spite 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	,	they	're	now	 consider 	 ed 	 	 critical 	 ly 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	.
in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	where	i	made	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 stock 	 s 	 	have	 decline 	 d 	 	about	90	percent	in	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	that	 show 	 s 	 	a	 hatch 	 ling 	 	about	to	taste	 salt 	 water 	 	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	 begin 	 ning 	 	 th 	 is 	 	long	and	 peril 	 ous 	 	journey	.
 on 	 ly 	 	one	in	a	thousand	 leather 	 back 	 	 hatch 	 ling 	 s 	 	will	reach	 matur 	 ity 	 	.
but	that	's	due	to	natural	 predator 	 s 	 	like	 vulture 	 s 	 	that	pick	them	off	on	a	beach	or	 predator 	 y 	 	fish	that	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	 off 	 shore 	 	.
nature	 ha 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	 compens 	 ate 	 	with	that	,	and	 female 	 s 	 	have	 multi 	 ple 	 	 clutch 	 es 	 	of	 egg 	 s 	 	to	 over 	 come 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 odd 	 s 	 	.
but	what	they	ca	n't	deal	with	is	 anthropo 	 genic 	 	 stress 	 es 	 	,	human	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	picture	that	 show 	 s 	 	a	 leather 	 back 	 	caught	at	night	in	a	gill	net	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 jump 	 ed 	 	in	and	 photograph 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	with	the	 fish 	 er 	 man 	 	's	 per 	 mission 	 	,	i	cut	the	turtle	out	,	and	it	was	able	to	swim	free	.
but	,	you	know	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	other	 leather 	 back 	 s 	 	each	year	are	not	so	fortunate	,	and	the	species	'	future	is	in	great	danger	.
 an 	 other 	 	 charisma 	 tic 	 	 mega 	 fauna 	 	species	that	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	is	the	story	i	did	on	the	right	whale	.
and	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	the	story	is	 th 	 is 	 	with	right	 whale 	 s 	 	,	that	about	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	was	one	species	of	right	whale	on	the	planet	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	land	 masse 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	around	and	 ocean 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	,	the	species	sort	of	 separat 	 ed 	 	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	we	have	 essential 	 ly 	 	two	distinct	 stock 	 s 	 	.
we	have	the	southern	right	whale	that	we	see	here	and	the	north	atlantic	right	whale	that	we	see	here	with	a	mom	and	 ca 	 lf 	 	off	the	coast	of	florida	.
now	,	both	species	 we 	 re 	 	 hunt 	 ed 	 	to	the	 br 	 ink 	 	of	 extinct 	 ion 	 	by	the	early	 whal 	 ers 	 	,	but	the	southern	right	 whale 	 s 	 	have	 re 	 bound 	 ed 	 	a	lot	better	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 locate 	 d 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	 far 	 ther 	 	away	from	human	activity	.
the	north	atlantic	right	whale	is	 list 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	on	the	planet	 to 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	urban	 whale 	 s 	 	;	they	live	 a 	 long 	 	the	east	coast	of	north	america	,	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	canada	,	and	they	have	to	deal	with	all	these	urban	 ill 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	photo	 show 	 s 	 	an	animal	 pop 	 ping 	 	 it 	 s 	 	head	out	at	 s 	 un 	 set 	 	off	the	coast	of	florida	.
you	can	see	the	coal	 burn 	 ing 	 	plant	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
they	have	to	deal	with	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 toxin 	 s 	 	and	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	that	are	 flush 	 ed 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	 affect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 re 	 production 	 	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	get	 entangle 	 d 	 	in	 fish 	 ing 	 	gear	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	that	 show 	 s 	 	the	tail	of	a	right	whale	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	white	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	not	natural	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 entangle 	 ment 	 	 scar 	 s 	 	.
72	percent	of	the	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 scar 	 s 	 	,	but	most	do	n't	shed	the	gear	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 lob 	 ster 	 	 trap 	 s 	 	and	crab	 pot 	 s 	 	.
they	hold	on	to	them	,	and	it	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 s 	 	them	.
and	the	other	problem	is	they	get	hit	by	 ship 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	animal	that	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	a	ship	in	nova	scotia	,	canada	 be 	 ing 	 	 tow 	 ed 	 	in	,	where	they	did	a	 necro 	 ps 	 y 	 	to	confirm	the	cause	of	death	,	which	was	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	a	ship	strike	.
so	all	of	these	 ill 	 s 	 	are	 stack 	 ing 	 	up	against	these	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 keep 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 number 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	low	.
and	to	draw	a	contrast	with	that	 bel 	 eaguer 	 ed 	 	north	atlantic	population	,	i	went	to	a	new	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	population	of	southern	right	 whale 	 s 	 	that	had	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	the	sub	-	antarctic	of	new	zealand	,	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	the	auckland	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
i	went	down	there	in	the	winter	time	.
and	these	are	 animal 	 s 	 	that	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	 human 	 s 	 	before	,	and	i	was	one	of	the	first	people	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	had	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
and	i	got	in	the	water	with	them	,	and	i	was	 amaz 	 ed 	 	at	how	 cur 	 ious 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	photograph	 show 	 s 	 	my	 assist 	 ant 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	bottom	at	about	70	feet	and	one	of	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	45	-	foot	,	70	-	ton	 whale 	 s 	 	,	like	a	city	bus	just	 swimm 	 ing 	 	up	,	you	know	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	in	perfect	condition	,	 ver 	 y 	 	fat	and	 health 	 y 	 	,	 ro 	 bust 	 	,	no	 entangle 	 ment 	 	 scar 	 s 	 	,	the	way	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	look	.
you	know	,	i	read	that	the	pilgrims	,	when	they	 land 	 ed 	 	at	plymouth	rock	in	massachusetts	in	1620	,	wrote	that	you	could	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	cape	cod	 ba 	 y 	 	on	the	 back 	 s 	 	of	right	 whale 	 s 	 	.
and	we	ca	n't	go	back	and	see	that	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	preserve	what	we	have	left	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	close	 th 	 is 	 	program	with	a	story	of	hope	,	a	story	i	did	on	marine	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	a	solution	to	the	problem	of	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	the	global	fish	crisis	story	.
i	 settl 	 ed 	 	on	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	country	of	new	zealand	 be 	 cause 	 	new	zealand	was	 ra 	 ther 	 	 progress 	 ive 	 	,	and	is	 ra 	 ther 	 	 progress 	 ive 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 protect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	ocean	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	to	be	about	three	 thing 	 s 	 	:	i	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	be	about	abundance	,	about	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	about	 resili 	 ence 	 	.
and	one	of	the	first	 place 	 s 	 	i	 work 	 ed 	 	was	a	 re 	 serve 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	goat	 is 	 land 	 	in	leigh	of	new	zealand	.
what	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	there	told	me	was	that	when	 protect 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	first	marine	 re 	 serve 	 	in	1975	,	they	 hop 	 ed 	 	and	 expect 	 ed 	 	that	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	might	happen	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	they	 hop 	 ed 	 	that	certain	species	of	fish	like	the	new	zealand	 snap 	 per 	 	would	return	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	 fish 	 ed 	 	to	the	 br 	 ink 	 	of	commercial	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.
and	they	did	come	back	.	what	they	could	n't	predict	was	that	other	 thing 	 s 	 	would	happen	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	these	fish	 pre 	 date 	 	on	sea	 urchin 	 s 	 	,	and	when	the	fish	 we 	 re 	 	all	gone	,	all	 any 	 one 	 	ever	saw	 under 	 water 	 	was	just	 acre 	 s 	 	and	 acre 	 s 	 	of	sea	 urchin 	 s 	 	.
but	when	the	fish	came	back	and	 beg 	 an 	 	 pre 	 d 	 ating 	 	and	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	urchin	population	,	low	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	kelp	 forest 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	 sh 	 allow 	 	water	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 urchin 	 s 	 	eat	kelp	.
so	when	the	fish	control	the	urchin	population	,	the	ocean	was	 resto 	 red 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	natural	equilibrium	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	how	the	ocean	 look 	 ed 	 	here	one	or	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	was	around	to	tell	us	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	new	zealand	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	in	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	fragile	,	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	like	in	fiordland	,	where	 th 	 is 	 	sea	pen	 colon 	 y 	 	was	found	.
little	blue	cod	 swimm 	 ing 	 	in	for	a	dash	of	color	.
in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	part	of	new	zealand	,	i	dove	in	the	blue	water	,	where	the	water	's	a	little	 warm 	 er 	 	,	and	 photograph 	 ed 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	giant	 s 	 ting 	 	ray	 swimm 	 ing 	 	through	an	 under 	 water 	 	canyon	.
every	part	of	the	 eco 	 system 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	place	 seem 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	from	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	 animal 	 s 	 	like	a	 nud 	 ib 	 rank 	 	 crawl 	 ing 	 	over	 en 	 crust 	 ing 	 	sponge	or	a	 leather 	 jacket 	 	that	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	animal	in	 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 system 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 graze 	 s 	 	on	the	bottom	and	 allow 	 s 	 	new	life	to	take	hold	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	finish	with	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	,	a	picture	i	made	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 storm 	 y 	 	day	in	new	zealand	when	i	just	laid	on	the	bottom	 a 	 mid 	 st 	 	a	school	of	fish	 swirl 	 ing 	 	around	me	.
and	i	was	in	a	place	that	had	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	divers	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 div 	 ing 	 	there	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	marine	life	was	better	here	 to 	 day 	 	than	it	was	in	the	1960s	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	,	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	come	back	.
so	i	think	the	 mess 	 age 	 	is	clear	.
the	ocean	is	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 resili 	 ent 	 	and	 toler 	 ant 	 	to	a	point	,	but	we	must	be	good	 custodian 	 s 	 	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	an	 under 	 water 	 	 photograph 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	fell	in	love	with	the	sea	,	and	i	make	 picture 	 s 	 	of	it	 to 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	protect	it	,	and	i	do	n't	think	it	's	too	late	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
