thank	you	.
 imagin 	 ing 	 	a	 s 	 olo 	 	cello	concert	,	one	would	most	 like 	 ly 	 	think	of	johann	sebastian	bach	 un 	 accompani 	 ed 	 	cello	 suit 	 es 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	child	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	these	 e 	 ternal 	 	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	,	bach	's	music	would	 inter 	 mingle 	 	with	the	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	of	muslim	 pray 	 ers 	 	from	the	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	arab	village	of	the	 north 	 ern 	 	kibbutz	in	israel	where	i	grew	up	.
late	at	night	,	after	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	,	i	would	listen	to	janis	joplin	and	billie	 holi 	 day 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	 tan 	 go 	 	music	would	be	 creep 	 ing 	 	from	my	 parent 	 s 	 	'	stereo	.
it	all	 be 	 came 	 	music	to	me	.
i	did	n't	hear	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	.
i	still	start	every	day	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	bach	.
his	music	never	 cease 	 s 	 	to	sound	fresh	and	surprising	to	me	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	moving	away	from	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 classic 	 al 	 	repertoire	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	new	ways	of	musical	 express 	 ion 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	with	 to 	 day 	 	's	 techno 	 logical 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	there	's	no	reason	to	limit	what	can	be	 produce 	 d 	 	at	one	time	from	a	single	string	instrument	.
the	power	and	 cohere 	 ncy 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	one	person	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	and	 play 	 ing 	 	all	the	 voice 	 s 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	experience	.
the	 excit 	 ement 	 	of	a	great	orchestra	performance	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	attempt	to	have	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	of	 music 	 ians 	 	producing	one	 un 	 ified 	 	whole	 con 	 cept 	 	.
the	 excit 	 ement 	 	from	using	multi	-	 track 	 ing 	 	,	the	way	i	did	in	the	piece	you	will	hear	next	,	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	attempt	to	build	and	create	a	whole	 uni 	 verse 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	,	all	generated	from	a	single	source	.
my	cello	and	my	voice	are	 layer 	 ed 	 	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	large	sonic	canvas	.
when	 compose 	 rs 	 	write	music	for	me	,	i	ask	them	to	forget	what	they	know	about	the	cello	.
i	hope	to	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	new	 territ 	 ories 	 	to	discover	 sound 	 s 	 	i	have	never	heard	before	.
i	want	to	create	 end 	 less 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	cello	.
i	 be 	 come 	 	the	medium	through	which	the	music	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 channel 	 ed 	 	,	and	in	the	process	,	when	all	is	right	,	the	music	is	 transform 	 ed 	 	and	so	am	i	.
