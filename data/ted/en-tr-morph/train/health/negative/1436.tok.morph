i	do	n't	know	why	,	but	i	'm	 continu 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	to	think	that	two	and	a	half	billion	of	us	around	the	world	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	each	other	through	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	that	at	any	point	in	time	more	than	30	percent	of	the	world	's	population	can	go	 on 	 line 	 	to	learn	,	to	create	and	to	share	.
and	the	amount	of	time	each	of	us	is	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	go	grow	.
a	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	that	the	young	generation	 al 	 one 	 	is	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	over	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	 on 	 line 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	parent	of	a	nine	-	year	-	old	girl	,	that	number	 seem 	 s 	 	 awful 	 ly 	 	low	.
but	just	 a 	 s 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	up	the	world	for	each	and	every	one	of	us	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	up	each	and	every	one	of	us	to	the	world	.
and	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	the	price	we	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	pay	for	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	is	our	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	what	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	would	love	to	 believ 	 e 	 	is	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	a	private	place	;	it	's	not	.
and	with	every	click	of	the	mouse	and	every	touch	of	the	screen	,	we	are	like	hansel	and	gretel	 leav 	 ing 	 	 bread 	 crumb 	 s 	 	of	our	personal	information	 every 	 where 	 	we	travel	through	the	digital	 wood 	 s 	 	.
we	are	 leav 	 ing 	 	our	 birth 	 day 	 s 	 	,	our	 place 	 s 	 	of	residence	,	our	 interest 	 s 	 	and	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	our	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	our	financial	 histo 	 ries 	 	,	and	on	and	on	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
now	do	n't	get	me	wrong	,	i	'm	not	for	one	minute	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	sharing	data	is	a	bad	thing	.
in	fact	,	when	i	know	the	data	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 share 	 d 	 	and	i	'm	 ask 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	for	my	consent	,	i	want	some	 s 	 ites 	 	to	understand	my	 habit 	 s 	 	.
it	 help 	 s 	 	them	suggest	 book 	 s 	 	for	me	to	read	or	 movie 	 s 	 	for	my	family	to	watch	or	 friend 	 s 	 	for	us	to	connect	with	.
but	when	i	do	n't	know	and	when	i	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	that	's	when	the	problem	 arise 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 behavior 	 al 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	big	business	.
in	fact	,	there	's	an	entire	industry	 form 	 ed 	 	around	 follow 	 ing 	 	us	through	the	digital	 wood 	 s 	 	and	 compil 	 ing 	 	a	profile	on	each	of	us	.
and	when	all	of	that	data	is	held	,	they	can	do	 al 	 most 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	with	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	area	 to 	 day 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 regulat 	 ions 	 	and	even	 few 	 er 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	for	some	of	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 announce 	 ments 	 	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	in	europe	,	it	's	an	area	of	consumer	 protect 	 ion 	 	that	's	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	naked	.
so	let	me	 ex 	 pose 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 lurk 	 ing 	 	industry	a	little	bit	further	.
the	 visual 	 ization 	 	you	see	 form 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	me	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 coll 	 usion 	 	and	it	's	an	 experiment 	 al 	 	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	add	-	on	that	you	can	install	in	your	firefox	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	that	 help 	 s 	 	you	see	where	your	web	data	is	going	and	who	's	 track 	 ing 	 	you	.
the	red	 dot 	 s 	 	you	see	up	there	are	 s 	 ites 	 	that	are	 behavior 	 al 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	that	i	have	not	 navig 	 ated 	 	to	,	but	are	 follow 	 ing 	 	me	.
the	blue	 dot 	 s 	 	are	the	 s 	 ites 	 	that	i	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 navig 	 ated 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	.
and	the	gray	 dot 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 ites 	 	that	are	 al 	 so 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	me	,	but	i	have	no	idea	who	they	are	.
all	of	them	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	to	form	a	picture	of	me	on	the	web	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	profile	.
so	let	me	go	from	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	and	personal	.
i	 install 	 ed 	 	 coll 	 usion 	 	in	my	own	 lap 	 top 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	and	i	let	it	follow	me	around	for	what	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	typical	day	.
now	like	most	of	you	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	my	day	going	 on 	 line 	 	and	 check 	 ing 	 	email	.
i	then	go	to	a	news	 s 	 ite 	 	,	look	for	some	 head 	 lines 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	case	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	like	one	of	them	on	the	 merit 	 s 	 	of	music	 liter 	 acy 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	and	i	 share 	 d 	 	it	over	a	social	network	.
our	daughter	then	 join 	 ed 	 	us	at	the	 break 	 fast 	 	table	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	,	``	is	there	an	 emphas 	 is 	 	on	music	 liter 	 acy 	 	in	your	school	?	``
and	she	,	of	course	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	nine	-	year	-	old	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	 quiz 	 z 	 ically 	 	,	``	what	's	 liter 	 acy 	 	?	``
so	i	 s 	 ent 	 	her	 on 	 line 	 	,	of	course	,	to	look	it	up	.
now	let	me	stop	here	.
we	are	not	even	two	 bite 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 break 	 fast 	 	and	there	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	25	 s 	 ites 	 	that	are	 track 	 ing 	 	me	.
i	have	 navig 	 ated 	 	to	a	total	of	four	.
so	let	me	fast	-	forward	through	the	rest	of	my	day	.
i	go	to	work	,	i	check	email	,	i	log	onto	a	few	more	social	 s 	 ites 	 	,	i	blog	,	i	check	more	news	 report 	 s 	 	,	i	share	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	news	 report 	 s 	 	,	i	go	look	at	some	 video 	 s 	 	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	typical	day	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	 ped 	 antic 	 	--	and	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	 a 	 s 	 	my	day	 wind 	 s 	 	down	,	look	at	my	profile	.
the	red	 dot 	 s 	 	have	 explode 	 d 	 	.
the	gray	 dot 	 s 	 	have	grown	 exponential 	 ly 	 	.
all	in	all	,	there	's	over	150	 s 	 ites 	 	that	are	now	 track 	 ing 	 	my	personal	information	,	most	all	of	them	 with 	 out 	 	my	consent	.
i	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	picture	and	it	 freak 	 s 	 	me	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	i	am	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 talk 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	web	.
and	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	--	it	's	huge	business	.
the	revenue	of	the	top	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	space	is	over	39	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	 al 	 one 	 	.
at	the	same	time	i	 install 	 ed 	 	my	own	 coll 	 usion 	 	profile	,	i	 install 	 ed 	 	one	for	my	daughter	.
and	on	one	single	saturday	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	over	two	 hour 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	here	's	her	 coll 	 usion 	 	profile	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	nine	-	year	-	old	girl	 navig 	 ating 	 	to	 principal 	 ly 	 	children	's	 s 	 ites 	 	.
i	move	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	from	 freak 	 ed 	 	out	to	 en 	 rag 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	me	 be 	 ing 	 	a	tech	pioneer	or	a	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	 advoc 	 ate 	 	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	me	 be 	 ing 	 	a	parent	.
imagine	in	the	physical	world	if	 some 	 body 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	our	children	around	with	a	camera	and	a	 note 	 book 	 	and	 record 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	every	 move 	 ment 	 	.
i	can	tell	you	,	there	is	n't	a	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	that	would	 s 	 it 	 	 id 	 ly 	 	by	.
we	'd	take	action	.	it	may	not	be	good	action	,	but	we	would	take	action	.
we	ca	n't	 s 	 it 	 	 id 	 ly 	 	by	here	either	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	is	not	an	option	,	and	it	should	n't	be	the	price	we	accept	for	just	 get 	 ting 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
our	 voice 	 s 	 	matter	and	our	 action 	 s 	 	matter	even	more	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	've	 launch 	 ed 	 	 coll 	 usion 	 	.
you	can	download	it	,	install	it	in	firefox	,	to	see	who	is	 track 	 ing 	 	you	 a 	 cross 	 	the	web	and	 follow 	 ing 	 	you	through	the	digital	 wood 	 s 	 	.
going	forward	,	all	of	our	 voice 	 s 	 	need	to	be	heard	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	do	n't	know	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hurt	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 memor 	 y 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
we	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	now	time	for	us	to	watch	the	 watch 	 ers 	 	.
thank	you	.
