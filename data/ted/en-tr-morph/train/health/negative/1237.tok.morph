so	i	have	a	strange	 care 	 er 	 	.
i	know	it	 be 	 cause 	 	people	come	up	to	me	,	like	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	and	say	,	``	chris	,	you	have	a	strange	 care 	 er 	 	.	``
and	i	can	see	 the 	 ir 	 	point	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 theoretic 	 al 	 	nuclear	physicist	.
and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	and	 glu 	 on 	 s 	 	and	heavy	ion	 collision 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	 on 	 ly 	 	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
no	,	no	,	i	was	n't	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
but	after	that	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	my	own	lab	in	the	 computation 	 al 	 	 neuro 	 science 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	and	i	was	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	any	 neuro 	 science 	 	.
 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	would	work	on	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	and	i	would	work	on	 system 	 s 	 	biology	.
but	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	how	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	life	.
and	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	rocket	scientist	.
i	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	a	rocket	scientist	,	but	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	jet	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	in	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	california	where	it	's	warm	;	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	now	i	'm	in	the	mid	-	west	,	and	it	's	cold	.
but	it	was	an	 excit 	 ing 	 	experience	.
one	day	a	nasa	 manage 	 r 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	 off 	 ice 	 	,	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	down	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	can	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	tell	us	,	how	do	we	look	for	life	 out 	 side 	 	earth	?	``
and	that	came	 a 	 s 	 	a	surprise	to	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hire 	 d 	 	to	work	on	 quant 	 um 	 	computation	.
yet	,	i	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	answer	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	no	idea	.	``
and	he	told	me	,	``	biosignatures	,	we	need	to	look	for	a	 bio 	 signature 	 	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	is	that	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	any	 measur 	 able 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	 indic 	 ate 	 	the	presence	of	life	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 re 	 ally 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	is	n't	that	easy	?
i	mean	,	we	have	life	.
ca	n't	you	 app 	 ly 	 	a	definition	,	like	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	-	like	definition	of	life	?	``
and	then	i	thought	about	it	a	little	bit	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	that	easy	?
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	if	you	see	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	then	all	right	,	fine	,	i	'm	going	to	call	it	life	--	no	doubt	about	it	.
but	here	's	 some 	 thing 	 	.	``
and	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	right	,	that	's	life	too	.	i	know	that	.	``
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	if	you	think	life	is	 al 	 so 	 	defined	by	 thing 	 s 	 	that	die	,	you	're	not	in	luck	with	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	organism	.
it	 grow 	 s 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	adult	stage	like	that	and	then	 go 	 es 	 	through	a	benjamin	button	phase	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	and	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	it	's	like	a	little	embryo	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	then	 actual 	 ly 	 	 grow 	 s 	 	back	up	,	and	back	down	and	back	up	--	sort	of	yo	-	yo	--	and	it	never	dies	.
so	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	life	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	we	thought	life	would	be	.
and	then	you	see	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
and	he	was	like	,	``	my	god	,	what	kind	of	a	life	form	is	that	?	``
 any 	 one 	 	know	?
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	life	,	it	's	a	crystal	.
so	once	you	start	looking	and	looking	at	 small 	 er 	 	and	 small 	 er 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	so	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	person	wrote	a	whole	article	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	these	are	bacteria	.	``
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	if	you	look	a	little	bit	 close 	 r 	 	,	you	see	,	in	fact	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	way	too	small	to	be	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
so	he	was	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	,	but	,	in	fact	,	most	people	are	n't	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	nasa	 al 	 so 	 	had	a	big	 announce 	 ment 	 	,	and	 p 	 resident 	 	clinton	 g 	 ave 	 	a	press	 con 	 ference 	 	,	about	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	of	life	in	a	martian	meteorite	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	that	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 heav 	 ily 	 	 disput 	 ed 	 	.
if	you	take	the	 less 	 on 	 	of	all	these	 picture 	 s 	 	,	then	you	 real 	 ize 	 	,	well	 actual 	 ly 	 	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	not	that	easy	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	do	need	a	definition	of	life	in	order	to	make	that	kind	of	 distinct 	 ion 	 	.
so	can	life	be	defined	?
well	how	would	you	go	about	it	?
well	of	course	,	you	'd	go	to	encyclopedia	britannica	and	open	at	l	.
no	,	of	course	you	do	n't	do	that	;	you	put	it	 some 	 where 	 	in	google	.
and	then	you	might	get	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	what	you	might	get	--	and	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 refer 	 s 	 	to	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	are	used	to	,	you	throw	away	.
and	then	you	might	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	it	 say 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	with	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
who	on	earth	would	write	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 con 	 volu 	 ted 	 	and	complex	and	 in 	 ane 	 	?
oh	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 import 	 ant 	 	set	of	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	 high 	 light 	 ing 	 	just	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	and	 say 	 ing 	 	 definition 	 s 	 	like	that	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	not	based	on	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	or	 leav 	 es 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	are	used	to	,	but	in	fact	on	 process 	 es 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	.
and	if	you	take	a	look	at	that	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	a	book	that	i	wrote	that	 deal 	 s 	 	with	artificial	life	.
and	that	 explain 	 s 	 	why	that	nasa	 manage 	 r 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	to	begin	with	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	idea	was	that	,	with	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	like	that	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 manufactur 	 e 	 	a	form	of	life	.
and	so	if	you	go	and	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	what	on	earth	is	artificial	life	?	``	,	let	me	give	you	a	 whirl 	 wind 	 	tour	of	how	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	came	about	.
and	it	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	ago	when	 some 	 one 	 	wrote	one	of	the	first	 success 	 ful 	 	computer	viruses	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	n't	old	 en 	 ough 	 	,	you	have	no	idea	how	 th 	 is 	 	 infect 	 ion 	 	was	 work 	 ing 	 	--	 name 	 ly 	 	,	through	these	 flop 	 py 	 	 dis 	 k 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	these	computer	virus	 infect 	 ions 	 	was	that	,	if	you	look	at	the	rate	at	which	the	 infect 	 ion 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	,	they	show	 th 	 is 	 	 spi 	 ky 	 	behavior	that	you	're	used	to	from	a	flu	virus	.
and	it	is	in	fact	due	to	 th 	 is 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	race	between	 hack 	 ers 	 	and	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	 design 	 ers 	 	that	 thing 	 s 	 	go	back	and	forth	.
and	the	result	is	kind	of	a	tree	of	life	of	these	viruses	,	a	 phyl 	 o 	 geny 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	the	type	of	life	that	we	're	used	to	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	on	the	viral	level	.
so	is	that	life	?	not	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 concern 	 ed 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	do	n't	evolve	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
in	fact	,	they	have	 hack 	 ers 	 	writing	them	.
but	the	idea	was	taken	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	a	little	bit	further	when	a	scientist	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	scientific	institute	 decide 	 d 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	we	try	to	package	these	little	viruses	in	artificial	 world 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	computer	and	let	them	evolve	?	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	steen	rasmussen	.
and	he	designed	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	work	,	 be 	 cause 	 	his	viruses	 we 	 re 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	 destroy 	 ing 	 	each	other	.
but	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	scientist	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	an	ecologist	.
and	he	went	home	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	know	how	to	fix	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	he	wrote	the	tierra	system	,	and	,	in	my	book	,	is	in	fact	one	of	the	first	 tru 	 ly 	 	artificial	living	 system 	 s 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	fact	that	these	 program 	 s 	 	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	grow	in	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
so	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	 work 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	came	in	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	create	a	system	that	 ha 	 s 	 	all	the	 proper 	 ties 	 	that	are	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	see	the	evolution	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	more	and	more	complex	 problem 	 s 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	.
and	of	course	,	since	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	know	how	to	write	code	,	i	had	help	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	had	two	 under 	 graduate 	 	 student 	 s 	 	at	california	institute	of	technology	that	 work 	 ed 	 	with	me	.
that	's	charles	offria	on	the	left	,	titus	 brow 	 n 	 	on	the	right	.
they	are	now	 actual 	 ly 	 	 respect 	 able 	 	 professor 	 s 	 	at	michigan	state	university	,	but	i	can	assure	you	,	back	in	the	day	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	not	a	 respect 	 able 	 	team	.
and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	that	no	photo	 surviv 	 es 	 	of	the	three	of	us	 any 	 where 	 	close	together	.
but	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	system	like	?
well	i	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 detail 	 s 	 	,	but	what	you	see	here	is	some	of	the	 en 	 trail 	 s 	 	.
but	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	focus	on	is	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	population	structure	.
there	's	about	10,000	 program 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	.
and	all	different	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	are	 color 	 ed 	 	in	different	 color 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	,	there	are	 group 	 s 	 	that	are	growing	on	top	of	each	other	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
any	time	there	is	a	program	that	's	better	at	 surviv 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	due	to	 what 	 ever 	 	mutation	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 acquir 	 ed 	 	,	it	is	going	to	spread	over	the	 other 	 s 	 	and	drive	the	 other 	 s 	 	to	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	movie	where	you	're	going	to	see	that	kind	of	dynamic	.
and	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ed 	 	with	 program 	 s 	 	that	we	wrote	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	write	our	own	stuff	,	replicate	it	,	and	are	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	we	put	them	in	,	and	what	you	see	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	is	that	there	are	 wave 	 s 	 	and	 wave 	 s 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 high 	 ly 	 	 accele 	 rated 	 	,	so	it	's	like	a	thousand	 generation 	 s 	 	a	second	.
but	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	the	system	 go 	 es 	 	like	,	``	what	kind	of	dumb	piece	of	code	was	 th 	 is 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 improv 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	ways	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	.	``
so	you	see	 wave 	 s 	 	of	new	 type 	 s 	 	taking	over	the	other	 type 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	activity	 go 	 es 	 	on	for	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 while 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	main	easy	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 acquir 	 ed 	 	by	these	 program 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	see	sort	of	like	a	 s 	 ta 	 sis 	 	coming	on	for	a	new	type	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	which	is	going	to	spread	over	all	the	other	 innov 	 ations 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	before	and	is	 era 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	 gene 	 s 	 	that	it	had	before	,	 un 	 til 	 	a	new	type	of	 high 	 er 	 	level	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	process	 go 	 es 	 	on	and	on	and	on	.
so	what	we	see	here	is	a	system	that	 live 	 s 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	way	we	're	used	to	life	[	going	.	]	but	what	the	nasa	people	had	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	 re 	 ally 	 	was	,	``	do	these	 guy 	 s 	 	have	a	 bio 	 signature 	 	?
can	we	measure	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	life	?
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	can	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	have	a	chance	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ing 	 	life	 some 	 where 	 	else	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 bias 	 ed 	 	by	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	should	construct	a	 bio 	 signature 	 	based	on	life	 a 	 s 	 	a	universal	process	.
in	fact	,	it	should	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	make	use	of	the	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	that	i	 develop 	 ed 	 	just	in	order	to	sort	of	capture	what	a	simple	living	system	might	be	.	``
and	the	thing	i	came	up	with	--	i	have	to	first	give	you	an	 introduc 	 tion 	 	about	the	idea	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	that	would	be	a	meaning	 detect 	 or 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	life	 detect 	 or 	 	.
and	the	way	we	would	do	that	--	i	would	like	to	find	out	how	i	can	distinguish	text	that	was	written	by	a	million	 monkey 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	text	that	[	is	]	in	our	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	i	would	like	to	do	it	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	i	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	be	able	to	read	the	language	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	i	wo	n't	be	able	to	.
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	i	know	that	there	's	some	sort	of	 alpha 	 bet 	 	.
so	here	would	be	a	frequency	plot	of	how	often	you	find	each	of	the	26	 letter 	 s 	 	of	the	 alpha 	 bet 	 	in	a	text	written	by	random	 monkey 	 s 	 	.
and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	each	of	these	 letter 	 s 	 	 come 	 s 	 	off	about	 rough 	 ly 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	frequent	.
but	if	you	now	look	at	the	same	 distribut 	 ion 	 	in	english	 text 	 s 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	that	.
and	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 ro 	 bust 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	english	 text 	 s 	 	.
and	if	i	look	at	french	 text 	 s 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	different	,	or	italian	or	german	.
they	all	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	type	of	frequency	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	but	it	's	 ro 	 bust 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 whet 	 her 	 	it	 write 	 s 	 	about	 politic 	 s 	 	or	about	science	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	poem	or	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	text	.
it	's	a	 ro 	 bust 	 	signature	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 table 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	our	 book 	 s 	 	are	written	in	english	--	 be 	 cause 	 	people	are	 re 	 writing 	 	them	and	 re 	 copy 	 ing 	 	them	--	it	's	going	to	be	there	.
so	that	inspired	me	to	think	about	,	well	,	what	if	i	try	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	idea	in	order	,	not	to	detect	random	 text 	 s 	 	from	 text 	 s 	 	with	meaning	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	detect	the	fact	that	there	is	meaning	in	the	 bio 	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	make	up	life	.
but	first	i	have	to	ask	:	what	are	these	building	 block 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 alpha 	 bet 	 	,	 element 	 s 	 	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	?
well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	we	have	 man 	 y 	 	different	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	for	 s 	 uch 	 	a	set	of	building	 block 	 s 	 	.
we	could	use	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	we	could	use	 nuclei 	 c 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	 carb 	 oxy 	 lic 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	fatty	 acid 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	 chemist 	 ry 	 	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	rich	,	and	our	body	uses	a	lot	of	them	.
so	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	test	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	first	took	a	look	at	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	and	some	other	 carb 	 oxy 	 lic 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	the	result	.
here	is	,	in	fact	,	what	you	get	if	you	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	look	at	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	on	a	 com 	 et 	 	or	in	 inter 	 stellar 	 	space	or	,	in	fact	,	in	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	where	you	made	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	in	your	primordial	soup	that	there	is	not	living	stuff	in	there	.
what	you	find	is	 most 	 ly 	 	glycine	and	then	alanine	and	there	's	some	trace	 element 	 s 	 	of	the	other	 one 	 s 	 	.
that	is	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 ro 	 bust 	 	--	what	you	find	in	 system 	 s 	 	like	earth	where	there	are	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	but	there	is	no	life	.
but	suppose	you	take	some	dirt	and	dig	through	it	and	then	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	these	 spect 	 rometers 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	bacteria	all	over	the	place	;	or	you	take	water	 any 	 where 	 	on	earth	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 team 	 ing 	 	with	life	,	and	you	make	the	same	analysis	;	the	spectrum	 look 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
of	course	,	there	is	still	glycine	and	alanine	,	but	in	fact	,	there	are	these	heavy	 element 	 s 	 	,	these	heavy	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	 valu 	 able 	 	to	the	organism	.
and	some	other	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	not	used	in	the	set	of	20	,	they	will	not	appear	at	all	in	any	type	of	 concent 	 ration 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 ro 	 bust 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	what	kind	of	sediment	you	're	using	to	grind	up	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	bacteria	or	any	other	 plant 	 s 	 	or	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 where 	 	there	's	life	,	you	're	going	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	that	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
and	it	is	 detect 	 able 	 	not	just	in	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	.
now	you	could	ask	:	well	,	what	about	these	avidians	?
the	avidians	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 den 	 izen 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	computer	world	where	they	are	 perfect 	 ly 	 	happy	 replica 	 ting 	 	and	growing	in	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	that	you	get	if	,	in	fact	,	there	is	no	life	.
they	have	about	28	of	these	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.
and	if	you	have	a	system	where	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	one	by	the	other	,	it	's	like	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	writing	on	a	 type 	 writer 	 	.
each	of	these	 instruct 	 ions 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	with	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	equal	frequency	.
but	if	you	now	take	a	set	of	 replica 	 ting 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	like	in	the	video	that	you	saw	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	there	are	some	 instruct 	 ions 	 	that	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	to	these	 organism 	 s 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	frequency	is	going	to	be	high	.
and	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	some	 instruct 	 ions 	 	that	you	 on 	 ly 	 	use	once	,	if	ever	.
so	they	are	either	 poison 	 ous 	 	or	 re 	 ally 	 	should	be	used	at	less	of	a	level	than	random	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	frequency	is	lower	.
and	so	now	we	can	see	,	is	that	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 ro 	 bust 	 	signature	?
i	can	tell	you	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	it	is	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	spectrum	,	just	like	what	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	just	like	what	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	how	you	change	the	environment	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 ro 	 bust 	 	;	it	's	going	to	reflect	the	environment	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	now	a	little	experiment	that	we	did	.
and	i	have	to	explain	to	you	,	the	top	of	 th 	 is 	 	graph	 show 	 s 	 	you	that	frequency	 distribut 	 ion 	 	that	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	.
here	,	in	fact	,	that	's	the	 life 	 less 	 	environment	where	each	 instruct 	 ion 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	at	an	equal	frequency	.
and	 be 	 low 	 	there	,	i	show	,	in	fact	,	the	mutation	rate	in	the	environment	.
and	i	'm	 start 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	at	a	mutation	rate	that	is	so	high	that	,	even	if	you	would	drop	a	 replica 	 ting 	 	program	that	would	 other 	 wise 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	grow	up	to	fill	the	entire	world	,	if	you	drop	it	in	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 mut 	 ated 	 	to	death	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
so	there	is	no	life	possible	at	that	type	of	mutation	rate	.
but	then	i	'm	going	to	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	turn	down	the	heat	,	so	to	speak	,	and	then	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 vi 	 ability 	 	threshold	where	now	it	would	be	possible	for	a	 replica 	 tor 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	live	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	're	going	to	be	dropping	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	soup	all	the	time	.
so	let	's	see	what	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
so	first	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
too	hot	,	too	hot	.
now	the	 vi 	 ability 	 	threshold	is	 reach 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	frequency	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 change 	 d 	 	and	,	in	fact	,	 stabil 	 ize 	 s 	 	.
and	now	what	i	did	there	is	,	i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	nasty	,	i	just	 turn 	 ed 	 	up	the	heat	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	of	course	,	it	 reach 	 es 	 	the	 vi 	 ability 	 	threshold	.
and	i	'm	just	 show 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	you	 aga 	 in 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	nice	.
you	hit	the	 vi 	 ability 	 	threshold	.
the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 change 	 s 	 	to	``	 al 	 ive 	 	!	``
and	then	,	once	you	hit	the	threshold	where	the	mutation	rate	is	so	high	that	you	can	not	self	-	 re 	 produce 	 	,	you	can	not	copy	the	information	forward	to	your	 off 	 spring 	 	 with 	 out 	 	making	so	 man 	 y 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	that	your	ability	to	replicate	 vanish 	 es 	 	.
and	then	that	signature	is	lost	.
what	do	we	learn	from	that	?
well	,	i	think	we	learn	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	from	that	.
one	of	them	is	,	if	we	are	able	to	think	about	life	in	abstract	 term 	 s 	 	--	and	we	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 plant 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	bacteria	,	but	we	think	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 process 	 es 	 	--	then	we	could	start	to	think	about	life	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	so	special	to	earth	,	but	that	,	in	fact	,	could	exist	 any 	 where 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	these	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	information	,	of	storing	information	 with 	 in 	 	physical	 substrate 	 s 	 	--	 any 	 thing 	 	:	bits	,	 nuclei 	 c 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	an	 alpha 	 bet 	 	--	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	there	's	some	process	so	that	 th 	 is 	 	information	can	be	 store 	 d 	 	for	much	 long 	 er 	 	than	you	would	expect	the	time	 scale 	 s 	 	for	the	 deterio 	 ration 	 	of	information	.
and	if	you	can	do	that	,	then	you	have	life	.
so	the	first	thing	that	we	learn	is	that	it	is	possible	to	define	life	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 process 	 es 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 refer 	 ring 	 	at	all	to	the	type	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	hold	dear	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	the	type	of	life	on	earth	is	.
and	that	in	a	sense	 re 	 move 	 s 	 	us	 aga 	 in 	 	,	like	all	of	our	scientific	 discover 	 ies 	 	,	or	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	--	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 continu 	 ous 	 	 dethron 	 ing 	 	of	man	--	of	how	we	think	we	're	special	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 al 	 ive 	 	.
well	we	can	make	life	.	we	can	make	life	in	the	computer	.
 grant 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	but	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	what	it	 take 	 s 	 	in	order	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	construct	it	.
and	once	we	have	that	,	then	it	is	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	difficult	task	 any 	 more 	 	to	say	,	if	we	understand	the	fundamental	 process 	 es 	 	that	do	not	refer	to	any	 part 	 icular 	 	substrate	,	then	we	can	go	out	and	try	other	 world 	 s 	 	,	figure	out	what	kind	of	chemical	alphabets	might	there	be	,	figure	 en 	 ough 	 	about	the	normal	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	the	geochemistry	of	the	planet	,	so	that	we	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	would	look	like	in	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	life	,	and	then	look	for	large	 dev 	 iation 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	chemical	 re 	 ally 	 	should	n't	be	there	.	``
now	we	do	n't	know	that	there	's	life	then	,	but	we	could	say	,	``	well	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	'm	going	to	have	to	take	a	look	 ver 	 y 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	chemical	and	see	where	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	.	``
and	that	might	be	our	chance	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ing 	 	life	when	we	can	not	 vis 	 ibly 	 	see	it	.
and	so	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	take	-	home	 mess 	 age 	 	that	i	have	for	you	.
life	can	be	less	 myster 	 ious 	 	than	we	make	it	out	to	be	when	we	try	to	think	about	how	it	would	be	on	other	 planet 	 s 	 	.
and	if	we	 re 	 move 	 	the	 myster 	 y 	 	of	life	,	then	i	think	it	is	a	little	bit	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	us	to	think	about	how	we	live	,	and	how	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	're	not	 a 	 s 	 	special	 a 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ways 	 	think	we	are	.
and	i	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	that	.
and	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
