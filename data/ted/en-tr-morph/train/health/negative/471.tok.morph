 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	of	two	 ra 	 ther 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	was	taken	18	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	was	19	 year 	 s 	 	old	at	the	time	.
i	had	just	 return 	 ed 	 	from	one	of	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 div 	 es 	 	i	'd	ever	made	at	that	time	,	--	a	little	over	200	feet	--	and	,	i	had	caught	 th 	 is 	 	little	fish	here	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	that	 part 	 icular 	 	one	was	the	first	live	one	of	that	ever	taken	 al 	 ive 	 	.
i	'm	not	just	an	 ichthyo 	 logist 	 	,	i	'm	a	 bon 	 a 	 	fide	fish	nerd	.
and	to	a	fish	nerd	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
and	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	was	the	fact	that	the	person	who	took	 th 	 is 	 	photo	was	a	guy	named	jack	randall	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	living	 ichthyo 	 logist 	 	on	earth	,	the	grand	poobah	of	fish	 nerd 	 s 	 	,	if	you	will	.
and	so	,	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	me	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	moment	in	time	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	set	the	course	for	the	rest	of	my	life	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	the	most	significant	thing	,	the	most	 pro 	 found 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	that	it	was	taken	two	 day 	 s 	 	before	i	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	from	the	neck	down	.
i	made	a	 re 	 ally 	 	stupid	kind	of	 mistak 	 e 	 	that	most	19	-	year	-	old	 male 	 s 	 	do	when	they	think	they	're	 im 	 mortal 	 	,	and	i	got	a	bad	case	of	the	 bend 	 s 	 	,	and	was	 paralyze 	 d 	 	,	and	had	to	be	 flow 	 n 	 	back	for	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	two	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	day	.
the	first	thing	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	--	well	,	i	'm	mortal	,	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	one	.
and	the	second	thing	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	,	with	 pro 	 found 	 	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	was	going	to	do	for	the	rest	of	my	life	.
i	had	to	focus	all	my	 energ 	 ies 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	going	to	find	new	species	of	 thing 	 s 	 	down	on	deep	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	.
now	,	when	you	think	of	a	coral	reef	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	most	people	think	of	:	all	these	big	,	hard	,	elaborate	 coral 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	bright	,	 color 	 ful 	 	 fish 	 es 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	just	the	tip	of	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	.
if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	a	coral	reef	,	we	know	a	lot	about	that	part	up	near	the	top	,	and	the	reason	we	know	so	much	about	it	is	scuba	divers	can	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	go	down	there	and	access	it	.
there	is	a	problem	with	scuba	 th 	 ough 	 	,	in	that	it	 impose 	 s 	 	some	 limit 	 ations 	 	on	how	deep	you	can	go	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	depth	is	about	200	feet	.
i	'll	get	 in 	 to 	 	why	that	is	in	just	a	minute	.
but	,	the	point	is	that	scuba	divers	 general 	 ly 	 	stay	less	than	100	feet	deep	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	go	much	 be 	 low 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	not	with	any	kind	of	 sanit 	 y 	 	.
so	,	to	go	 deep 	 er 	 	,	most	 biologist 	 s 	 	have	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	 submersible 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 submersible 	 s 	 	are	great	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	if	you	're	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	30,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	to	use	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 cap 	 able 	 	of	going	2,000	feet	,	you	're	 s 	 ure 	 	not	going	to	go	 fart 	 ing 	 	around	up	here	in	a	couple	of	hundred	feet	,	you	're	going	to	go	way	,	way	,	way	,	down	deep	.
so	,	the	bottom	line	is	that	 al 	 most 	 	all	research	using	 submersible 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	place	well	 be 	 low 	 	500	feet	.
now	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	obvious	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	that	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	zone	here	in	the	middle	and	that	's	the	zone	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 center 	 s 	 	around	my	own	personal	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	happiness	.
i	want	to	find	out	what	's	in	 th 	 is 	 	zone	.
we	know	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
scuba	divers	ca	n't	get	there	,	 sub 	 marine 	 s 	 	go	right	on	past	it	.
it	took	me	a	year	to	learn	how	to	walk	 aga 	 in 	 	after	i	had	my	 div 	 ing 	 	accident	in	palau	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	year	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	the	physics	and	physiology	of	 div 	 ing 	 	and	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	 over 	 come 	 	these	 limit 	 ations 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	just	going	to	show	you	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	.
we	're	all	 breath 	 ing 	 	air	right	now	.	air	is	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	oxygen	and	nitrogen	,	about	20	percent	oxygen	.	about	80	percent	nitrogen	is	in	our	 lung 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	henry	's	law	that	 say 	 s 	 	that	 gas 	 es 	 	will	 dis 	 solve 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	fluid	in	proportion	to	the	partial	 pressure 	 s 	 	which	you	're	 ex 	 posing 	 	them	to	.
so	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	gas	 dis 	 solve 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	body	.
the	oxygen	is	bound	by	 metabol 	 ism 	 	,	we	use	it	for	energy	.
the	nitrogen	just	sort	of	 float 	 s 	 	around	in	our	blood	and	 tissue 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	all	fine	,	that	's	how	we	're	designed	.
the	problem	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	start	to	go	 under 	 water 	 	.
now	,	the	 deep 	 er 	 	you	go	 under 	 water 	 	,	the	 high 	 er 	 	the	pressure	is	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	go	down	to	a	depth	of	about	130	feet	,	which	is	the	 recommend 	 ed 	 	limit	for	most	scuba	divers	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	pressure	effect	.
and	the	effect	of	that	pressure	is	that	you	have	an	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	density	of	gas	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	every	breath	you	take	.
over	time	,	 t 	 hose 	 	gas	 molecule 	 s 	 	 dis 	 solve 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	blood	and	 tissue 	 s 	 	and	start	to	fill	you	up	.
now	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	go	down	to	,	say	,	300	feet	,	you	do	n't	have	five	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	gas	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	your	 lung 	 s 	 	--	you	've	got	10	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	gas	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	your	 lung 	 s 	 	.
and	,	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	they	 dis 	 solve 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	blood	,	and	 in 	 to 	 	your	 tissue 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	of	course	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	down	to	where	there	's	15	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	--	the	 deep 	 er 	 	you	go	,	the	more	 ex 	 acerb 	 ating 	 	the	problem	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	.
and	the	problem	,	the	 limit 	 ation 	 	of	 div 	 ing 	 	with	air	is	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 dot 	 s 	 	in	your	body	--	all	the	nitrogen	and	all	the	oxygen	.
there	're	three	 bas 	 ic 	 	 limit 	 ations 	 	of	scuba	 div 	 ing 	 	.
the	first	 limit 	 ation 	 	is	the	oxygen	--	oxygen	 toxic 	 ity 	 	.
now	,	we	all	know	the	song	:	``	love	is	like	oxygen	.	/	you	get	too	much	,	you	get	too	high	.	/	not	 en 	 ough 	 	,	and	you	're	going	to	die	.	``
well	,	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 div 	 ing 	 	,	you	get	too	much	,	you	die	 al 	 so 	 	.
you	die	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	oxygen	 toxic 	 ity 	 	can	cause	a	seizure	--	 make 	 s 	 	you	 convuls 	 e 	 	 under 	 water 	 	,	not	a	good	thing	to	happen	 under 	 water 	 	.
it	 happen 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	too	much	 concent 	 ration 	 	of	oxygen	in	your	body	.
the	nitrogen	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 problem 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	is	what	jacques	cousteau	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 rap 	 ture 	 	of	the	deep	.	``
it	's	nitrogen	narcosis	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	you	 loop 	 y 	 	.
the	 deep 	 er 	 	you	go	,	the	 loop 	 ier 	 	you	get	.
you	do	n't	want	to	drive	drunk	,	you	do	n't	want	to	 d 	 ive 	 	drunk	,	so	that	's	a	real	big	problem	.
and	of	course	,	the	third	problem	is	the	one	i	found	out	the	hard	way	in	palau	,	which	is	the	 bend 	 s 	 	.
now	the	one	thing	that	i	 for 	 got 	 	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	,	is	that	to	 ob 	 vi 	 ate 	 	the	problem	of	the	nitrogen	narcosis	--	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	blue	 dot 	 s 	 	in	our	body	--	you	 re 	 move 	 	the	nitrogen	and	you	replace	it	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
now	 hel 	 ium 	 	's	a	gas	,	there	're	a	lot	of	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 hel 	 ium 	 	's	good	,	it	's	a	 tin 	 y 	 	molecule	,	it	's	 in 	 ert 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	you	narcosis	.
so	that	's	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	that	we	use	.
but	,	the	 theor 	 y 	 	's	 relat 	 ively 	 	easy	.
the	 trick 	 y 	 	part	is	the	 implement 	 ation 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	i	 beg 	 an 	 	,	about	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	'll	admit	,	it	was	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 smart 	 est 	 	of	 start 	 s 	 	,	but	,	you	know	,	you	got	to	start	 some 	 where 	 	.
at	the	time	,	i	was	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	who	did	n't	know	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	--	 al 	 most 	 	 no 	 body 	 	did	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	rig	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	for	a	 d 	 ive 	 	of	300	feet	.
over	time	we	got	a	little	bit	better	at	it	,	and	we	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	-	looking	rig	with	four	scuba	 tank 	 s 	 	and	five	 regulat 	 ors 	 	and	all	the	right	gas	 mix 	 ture 	 s 	 	and	all	that	good	stuff	.
and	it	was	fine	and	 dan 	 dy 	 	,	and	it	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	go	down	and	find	new	species	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	was	taken	300	feet	deep	,	 catch 	 ing 	 	new	species	of	fish	.
but	,	the	problem	was	that	it	did	n't	allow	us	much	time	.
for	all	 it 	 s 	 	bulk	and	 s 	 ize 	 	,	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	us	about	15	 minute 	 s 	 	at	most	down	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 depth 	 s 	 	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	more	time	.
there	had	to	be	a	better	way	.
and	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	there	is	a	better	way	.
in	1994	,	i	was	fortunate	 en 	 ough 	 	to	get	access	to	these	prototype	closed	-	circuit	 re 	 breath 	 ers 	 	.
 al 	 right 	 	,	closed	-	circuit	 re 	 breath 	 er 	 	--	what	is	it	about	it	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	different	from	scuba	,	and	why	is	it	better	?
well	,	there	are	three	main	 advantage 	 s 	 	to	a	 re 	 breath 	 er 	 	.
one	,	they	're	quiet	,	they	do	n't	make	any	noise	.
two	,	they	allow	you	to	stay	 under 	 water 	 	 long 	 er 	 	.
three	,	they	allow	you	to	go	 deep 	 er 	 	.
how	is	it	that	they	do	that	?
well	,	in	order	to	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	how	they	do	that	you	have	to	take	off	the	hood	,	and	look	 under 	 neath 	 	and	see	what	's	going	on	.
there	are	three	 bas 	 ic 	 	 system 	 s 	 	to	a	closed	-	circuit	 re 	 breath 	 er 	 	.
the	most	fundamental	of	these	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 breath 	 ing 	 	loop	.
it	's	a	 breath 	 ing 	 	loop	 be 	 cause 	 	you	breathe	off	of	it	,	and	it	's	a	closed	loop	,	and	you	breathe	the	same	gas	around	and	around	and	around	.
so	there	's	a	 mouth 	 piece 	 	that	you	put	in	your	mouth	,	and	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 counter 	 lung 	 	,	or	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	two	 counter 	 lung 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	 counter 	 lung 	 s 	 	are	n't	high	-	tech	,	they	're	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	 bag 	 s 	 	.
they	allow	you	to	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	breathe	,	or	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	 ventil 	 ate 	 	.
when	you	 exhal 	 e 	 	your	breath	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	in	the	 exhal 	 e 	 	 counter 	 lung 	 	:	when	you	 inhal 	 e 	 	a	breath	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 inhal 	 e 	 	 counter 	 lung 	 	.
it	's	just	 pur 	 e 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	you	to	cycle	air	through	 th 	 is 	 	 breath 	 ing 	 	loop	.
and	,	the	other	component	on	a	 breath 	 ing 	 	loop	is	the	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	 absorb 	 ent 	 	 can 	 ist 	 er 	 	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	breathe	,	we	produce	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	and	that	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 scrub 	 bed 	 	out	of	the	system	.
there	's	a	chemical	filter	in	there	that	 pull 	 s 	 	the	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	out	of	the	 breath 	 ing 	 	gas	--	so	that	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	us	to	breathe	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	safe	to	breathe	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	that	's	the	 breath 	 ing 	 	loop	in	a	 nut 	 shell 	 	.
the	second	main	component	of	a	closed	-	circuit	 re 	 breath 	 er 	 	is	the	gas	system	.
the	 prim 	 ary 	 	purpose	of	the	gas	system	is	to	provide	oxygen	,	to	replenish	the	oxygen	that	your	body	 consum 	 es 	 	.
so	the	main	tank	,	the	main	critical	thing	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	oxygen	gas	supply	cylinder	we	have	here	.
but	,	if	we	 on 	 ly 	 	had	an	oxygen	gas	supply	cylinder	we	would	n't	be	able	to	go	 ver 	 y 	 	deep	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	'd	run	 in 	 to 	 	oxygen	 toxic 	 ity 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	we	need	 an 	 other 	 	gas	,	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 di 	 lute 	 	the	oxygen	with	.
and	that	,	 fitting 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 dil 	 uent 	 	gas	supply	.
in	our	 application 	 s 	 	,	we	 general 	 ly 	 	put	air	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 dil 	 uent 	 	gas	supply	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	and	easy	source	of	nitrogen	.
so	that	's	where	we	get	our	nitrogen	from	.
but	,	if	we	want	to	go	 deep 	 er 	 	,	of	course	,	we	need	 an 	 other 	 	gas	supply	.
we	need	 hel 	 ium 	 	,	and	the	 hel 	 ium 	 	is	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	go	deep	.
and	 usual 	 ly 	 	we	'll	have	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 large 	 r 	 	cylinder	 mount 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 terior 	 	on	the	 re 	 breath 	 er 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	use	to	inject	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	start	to	do	our	deep	 div 	 es 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	second	oxygen	cylinder	,	that	's	 sole 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	back	-	up	in	case	there	's	a	problem	with	our	first	oxygen	supply	we	can	 continu 	 e 	 	to	breathe	.
and	the	way	you	manage	all	these	different	 gas 	 es 	 	and	all	these	different	gas	 suppli 	 es 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	high	-	tech	,	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	gas	block	up	on	the	front	here	,	where	it	's	easy	to	reach	.
it	's	got	all	the	 val 	 ves 	 	and	 knob 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	you	need	to	do	to	inject	the	right	 gas 	 es 	 	at	the	right	time	.
now	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	you	do	n't	have	to	do	that	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	for	you	with	the	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	the	third	system	of	a	 re 	 breath 	 er 	 	.
the	most	critical	part	of	a	 re 	 breath 	 er 	 	is	the	oxygen	 sensor 	 s 	 	.
you	need	three	of	them	,	so	that	if	one	of	them	 go 	 es 	 	bad	,	you	know	which	one	it	is	.
you	need	 vot 	 ing 	 	logic	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	have	three	 micro 	 processor 	 s 	 	.
any	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	can	run	the	entire	system	,	so	if	you	have	to	lose	two	of	them	,	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	back	-	up	power	 suppli 	 es 	 	.
and	of	course	there	're	 multi 	 ple 	 	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	,	to	get	the	information	to	the	 div 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	high	-	tech	 gadget 	 ry 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	do	what	we	do	on	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	deep	 div 	 es 	 	.
and	i	can	talk	about	it	all	day	--	just	ask	my	wife	--	but	i	want	to	move	on	to	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	kind	of	much	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	take	you	on	a	deep	 d 	 ive 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	what	it	's	like	to	do	one	of	these	 div 	 es 	 	that	we	do	.
we	start	up	here	on	the	boat	,	and	for	all	 th 	 is 	 	high	-	tech	,	expensive	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	still	the	best	way	to	get	in	the	water	--	just	pfft	!	--	flop	over	the	side	of	the	boat	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	in	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	these	 reef 	 s 	 	that	we	 d 	 ive 	 	on	start	out	near	the	surface	and	they	go	 al 	 most 	 	 vert 	 ically 	 	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	straight	down	.
so	,	we	drop	in	the	water	,	and	we	just	sort	of	go	over	the	edge	of	 th 	 is 	 	cliff	,	and	then	we	just	start	dropping	,	dropping	,	dropping	.
people	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	it	must	take	a	long	time	to	get	there	?	``
no	,	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	to	get	all	the	way	down	to	three	or	four	hundred	feet	,	which	is	where	we	're	 aim 	 ing 	 	for	.
it	's	kind	of	like	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	in	 s 	 low 	 	motion	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	--	you	ever	see	``	the	abyss	``	where	ed	harris	,	you	know	,	he	's	 sink 	 ing 	 	down	 a 	 long 	 	the	side	of	the	wall	?
that	's	kind	of	what	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	.	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	when	you	get	down	there	,	you	find	that	the	water	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	.
it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	clear	water	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 hard 	 ly 	 	any	plankton	.
but	,	when	you	turn	on	your	light	,	you	look	around	at	the	 cave 	 s 	 	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	you	're	 confront 	 ed 	 	with	a	tremendous	amount	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	much	more	than	 any 	 one 	 	used	to	 believ 	 e 	 	.
now	not	all	of	it	is	new	species	--	like	that	fish	you	see	with	the	white	 strip 	 e 	 	,	that	's	a	known	species	.
but	,	if	you	look	 care 	 fully 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 crack 	 s 	 	and	 cre 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	see	little	 thing 	 s 	 	 s 	 curr 	 y 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	place	.
there	's	a	just	-	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
it	's	not	just	fish	,	either	.
these	are	 cri 	 noids 	 	,	 sponge 	 s 	 	,	black	 coral 	 s 	 	.	there	're	some	more	 fish 	 es 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 fish 	 es 	 	that	you	see	right	now	are	new	species	.
they	're	still	new	species	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	a	video	camera	on	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	my	net	,	so	they	're	still	 wait 	 ing 	 	down	there	for	 some 	 one 	 	to	go	find	them	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 habit 	 at 	 	just	 go 	 es 	 	on	and	on	and	on	for	 mile 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	papua	,	new	guinea	.
now	little	 fish 	 es 	 	and	 in 	 vertebrate 	 s 	 	are	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	see	down	there	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	see	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	much	more	 regular 	 ly 	 	than	i	would	have	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	.
and	we	're	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	why	.
but	what	i	want	you	to	do	right	now	is	imagine	 your 	 self 	 	400	feet	 under 	 water 	 	,	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	high	-	tech	gear	on	your	back	,	you	're	in	a	remote	reef	off	papua	,	new	guinea	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	from	the	 near 	 est 	 	 re 	 compress 	 ion 	 	chamber	,	and	you	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
video	:	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	...
uh	-	oh	...	uh	-	oh	!
i	think	we	have	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	.
richard	pyle	:	when	you	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	like	donald	duck	,	there	's	no	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	the	world	that	can	seem	tense	.
so	,	we	're	down	there	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	at	400	feet	--	that	's	looking	straight	up	,	by	the	way	,	so	you	can	get	a	sense	of	how	far	away	the	surface	is	.
and	if	you	're	a	biologist	and	you	know	about	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	and	you	want	to	assess	,	you	know	,	how	much	 jeopard 	 y 	 	am	i	 re 	 ally 	 	in	here	,	there	's	one	question	that	sort	of	 jump 	 s 	 	to	the	 fore 	 front 	 	of	your	mind	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	which	is	--	 div 	 er 	 	1	:	what	kind	of	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	?
 div 	 er 	 	2	:	uh	,	 silver 	 tip 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
 div 	 er 	 	1	:	oh	.

the	 silver 	 tip 	 s 	 	are	the	one	with	the	white	 edge 	 s 	 	on	the	fin	,	and	there	're	 al 	 so 	 	gray	reef	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	and	some	 hammer 	 head 	 s 	 	off	in	the	distance	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	a	little	nerve	-	 wrack 	 ing 	 	.

that	little	guy	is	 fris 	 ky 	 	!
now	,	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	video	like	 th 	 is 	 	on	tv	a	lot	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 intimid 	 ating 	 	,	and	i	think	it	 give 	 s 	 	the	wrong	impression	about	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	and	that	's	why	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 worri 	 ed 	 	much	,	why	we	 we 	 re 	 	 jok 	 ing 	 	around	down	there	.
more	people	are	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	 pig 	 s 	 	,	more	people	are	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	 light 	 ning 	 	 strike 	 s 	 	,	more	people	are	 kill 	 ed 	 	at	soccer	 game 	 s 	 	in	england	.
there	's	a	lot	of	other	ways	you	can	die	.
and	i	'm	not	making	that	stuff	up	.
coconuts	!	you	can	get	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	a	coconut	more	 like 	 ly 	 	than	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	a	 s 	 hark 	 	.
so	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	are	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	most	people	make	them	out	to	be	.
now	,	i	do	n't	know	if	any	of	you	get	u.s.	news	and	world	report	--	i	got	the	 re 	 cent 	 	issue	.
there	's	a	cover	story	all	about	the	great	 explore 	 rs 	 	of	our	time	.
the	last	article	is	an	article	 en 	 titled 	 	``	no	new	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	.	``
it	 question 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	there	 re 	 ally 	 	are	any	new	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	out	there	,	 whet 	 her 	 	there	are	any	real	,	true	,	 hard 	 core 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	that	can	still	be	made	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	fish	nerd	,	i	have	to	laugh	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	they	do	n't	call	us	fish	 nerd 	 s 	 	for	 noth 	 ing 	 	--	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	get	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 find 	 ing 	 	a	new	 dor 	 s 	 al 	 	 s 	 pine 	 	in	a	 g 	 up 	 py 	 	.
but	,	it	's	much	more	than	that	.
and	,	i	want	to	show	you	a	few	of	the	 g 	 up 	 pies 	 	we	've	found	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	's	--	you	know	,	you	can	see	how	 ug 	 ly 	 	it	is	.
even	if	you	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	scientific	value	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	just	look	at	the	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	value	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
a	couple	of	these	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 get 	 ting 	 	 s 	 old 	 	through	the	 aqua 	 rium 	 	trade	to	japan	,	where	they	 s 	 old 	 	for	15,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	 a 	 piece 	 	.
that	's	half	-	a	-	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	pound	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	new	 angel 	 fish 	 	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	first	 discover 	 ed 	 	back	in	the	air	 day 	 s 	 	--	the	bad	old	air	 day 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	used	to	say	--	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	these	kind	of	 div 	 es 	 	with	air	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	at	360	feet	.
and	i	remember	coming	up	from	one	of	these	deep	 div 	 es 	 	,	and	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	fog	,	and	the	narcosis	 take 	 s 	 	a	little	while	to	,	you	know	,	 fad 	 e 	 	away	.
it	's	sort	of	like	 sober 	 ing 	 	up	.
and	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	vague	 re 	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 see 	 ing 	 	these	yellow	fish	with	a	black	spot	,	and	i	thought	,	``	aw	,	damn	.	i	should	have	caught	one	.
i	think	that	's	a	new	species	.	``
and	then	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	i	got	around	to	looking	in	my	 buck 	 et 	 	.
 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	i	had	caught	one	--	i	just	 complete 	 ly 	 	 for 	 got 	 	that	i	had	caught	one	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	one	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	the	name	centropyge	narcosis	to	.
so	that	's	it	's	official	scientific	name	,	in	 re 	 ference 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	deep	-	dwelling	 habit 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	neat	one	.
when	we	first	found	it	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	even	 s 	 ure 	 	what	family	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 belong 	 ed 	 	to	,	so	we	just	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	dr.	seuss	fish	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.
if	you	go	to	papua	,	new	guinea	,	and	go	down	300	feet	,	you	're	going	to	see	these	big	 mound 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	kind	of	hard	to	see	,	but	they	're	about	--	oh	,	a	couple	 meter 	 s 	 	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	.
if	you	look	 close 	 ly 	 	,	you	'll	see	there	's	a	little	white	fish	and	gray	fish	that	 hang 	 s 	 	out	near	them	.
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	little	white	fish	 build 	 s 	 	these	giant	 mound 	 s 	 	,	one	 pe 	 bble 	 	at	a	time	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	to	find	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	not	just	new	species	:	it	's	new	behavior	,	it	's	new	 eco 	 logy 	 	it	's	all	kind	of	new	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	,	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	right	now	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	is	just	a	 s 	 ampl 	 ing 	 	of	a	few	of	the	new	species	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
what	's	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	the	 she 	 er 	 	number	of	species	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	half	of	what	we	've	found	--	what	's	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	is	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	we	find	them	.
we	're	up	to	seven	new	species	per	hour	of	time	we	 s 	 pend 	 	at	that	depth	.
now	,	if	you	go	to	an	amazon	jungle	and	fog	a	tree	,	you	may	get	a	lot	of	 bug 	 s 	 	,	but	for	 fish 	 es 	 	,	there	's	 no 	 where 	 	in	the	world	you	can	get	seven	new	species	per	hour	of	time	.
now	,	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	some	back	of	the	 envelop 	 e 	 	 calcul 	 ations 	 	,	and	we	're	 predict 	 ing 	 	that	there	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	on	the	order	of	2,000	to	2,500	new	species	in	the	indo	-	 pac 	 ific 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	five	to	six	thousand	known	species	.
so	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 percent 	 age 	 	of	what	is	out	there	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	known	.
we	thought	we	had	a	handle	on	all	the	reef	fish	 divers 	 ity 	 	--	 evident 	 ly 	 	not	.
and	i	'm	going	to	just	close	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 som 	 ber 	 	note	.
at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	i	told	you	that	i	was	going	to	show	you	two	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	second	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	photograph	i	'm	going	to	show	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	was	taken	at	the	exact	moment	i	was	down	there	 film 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	taken	 exact 	 ly 	 	300	feet	above	my	head	.
and	the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	is	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 capture 	 s 	 	a	moment	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	minute	of	a	person	's	life	.
less	than	60	 second 	 s 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	picture	was	taken	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	was	dead	.
when	we	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	his	body	,	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	what	had	gone	wrong	.
he	had	made	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
he	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	wrong	 val 	 ve 	 	when	he	 fill 	 ed 	 	his	cylinder	--	he	had	80	percent	oxygen	in	his	tank	when	he	should	have	had	40	.
he	had	an	oxygen	 toxic 	 ity 	 	seizure	and	he	 drown 	 ed 	 	.
the	reason	i	show	 th 	 is 	 	--	not	to	put	a	 down 	 er 	 	on	 every 	 thing 	 	--	but	i	just	want	to	use	it	to	key	off	my	 philosoph 	 y 	 	of	life	in	general	,	which	is	that	we	all	have	two	 goal 	 s 	 	.
the	first	goal	we	share	with	every	other	living	thing	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	which	is	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.	i	call	it	 perpetu 	 ation 	 	:	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	the	species	and	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	both	about	 perpetu 	 ating 	 	the	genome	.
and	the	second	goal	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	have	 master 	 ed 	 	that	first	goal	,	is	to	--	you	know	,	you	call	it	spiritual	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	,	you	can	call	it	financial	success	,	you	can	call	it	any	number	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	call	it	seeking	joy	--	 th 	 is 	 	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	happiness	.
so	,	i	guess	my	theme	on	 th 	 is 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	guy	lived	his	life	to	the	 full 	 est 	 	,	he	 absolute 	 ly 	 	did	.
you	have	to	balance	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 goal 	 s 	 	.
if	you	live	your	whole	life	in	fear	--	i	mean	,	life	is	a	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	disease	with	100	percent	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
so	,	you	ca	n't	live	your	life	in	fear	.
i	thought	that	was	an	old	one	.
but	,	at	the	same	time	you	do	n't	want	to	get	so	focused	on	rule	number	two	,	or	goal	number	two	,	that	you	neglect	goal	number	one	.
 be 	 cause 	 	once	you	're	dead	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	enjoy	 any 	 thing 	 	after	that	.
i	wish	you	all	the	best	of	luck	in	 maintain 	 ing 	 	that	balance	in	your	future	 endeavor 	 s 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
