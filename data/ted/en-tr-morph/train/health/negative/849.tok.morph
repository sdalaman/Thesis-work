i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	ted	for	 near 	 ly 	 	a	decade	,	and	i	've	 ver 	 y 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	any	new	 song 	 s 	 	of	my	own	.
and	that	was	 large 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	n't	any	.
so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	with	a	couple	of	 project 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	them	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	nutmeg	.
a	1930s	ship	's	 life 	 boat 	 	,	which	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 storing 	 	in	the	garden	of	my	beach	house	in	england	.
and	,	so	now	,	when	the	polar	ice	 cap 	 s 	 	melt	,	my	 record 	 ing 	 	studio	will	rise	up	like	an	ark	,	and	i	'll	float	off	 in 	 to 	 	the	 drown 	 ed 	 	world	like	a	character	from	a	j.g	.	ballard	novel	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	the	nutmeg	 collect 	 s 	 	energy	from	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	on	the	roof	of	the	 wheel 	 house 	 	,	and	from	a	450	watt	turbine	up	the	mast	.
so	that	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	dark	,	i	've	got	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	power	.
and	i	can	light	up	the	nutmeg	like	a	beacon	.
and	so	i	go	in	there	 un 	 til 	 	the	early	 hour 	 s 	 	of	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	work	on	new	 song 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	play	to	you	 guy 	 s 	 	,	if	you	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	be	the	first	audience	to	hear	it	.
it	's	about	billie	 holi 	 day 	 	.
and	it	 appear 	 s 	 	that	,	some	night	in	1947	she	left	her	physical	space	and	was	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	all	night	,	 un 	 til 	 	she	 re 	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
but	i	know	where	she	was	.
she	was	with	me	on	my	 life 	 boat 	 	.
and	she	was	hot	.
