 hell 	 o 	 	!	my	name	is	golan	levin	.
i	'm	an	artist	and	an	engineer	,	which	is	,	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	a	more	common	kind	of	hybrid	.
but	i	still	fall	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	weird	crack	where	people	do	n't	seem	to	understand	me	.
and	i	was	looking	around	and	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	picture	.
it	's	a	letter	from	``	artforum	``	in	1967	 say 	 ing 	 	``	we	ca	n't	imagine	ever	 do 	 ing 	 	a	special	issue	on	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	or	 computer 	 s 	 	in	art	.	``	and	they	still	have	n't	.
and	 l 	 est 	 	you	think	that	you	all	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 dig 	 e 	 rati 	 	,	are	more	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	,	i	went	to	the	apple	iphone	app	store	the	other	day	.
where	's	art	?	i	got	 product 	 ivity 	 	.	i	got	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 how 	 	the	idea	that	one	would	want	to	make	art	for	the	iphone	,	which	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	i	are	 do 	 ing 	 	now	,	is	still	not	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	what	 computer 	 s 	 	are	for	.
so	,	from	both	 direction 	 s 	 	,	there	is	kind	of	,	i	think	,	a	lack	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	about	what	it	could	mean	to	be	an	artist	who	uses	the	 material 	 s 	 	of	his	own	day	,	or	her	own	day	,	which	i	think	 artist 	 s 	 	are	 oblig 	 ed 	 	to	do	,	is	to	 re 	 ally 	 	explore	the	 express 	 ive 	 	potential	of	the	new	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	have	.
in	my	own	case	,	i	'm	an	artist	,	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 expand 	 ing 	 	the	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	of	human	action	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 empower 	 ing 	 	people	through	 inter 	 activity 	 	.
i	want	people	to	discover	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 act 	 ors 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	creative	 act 	 ors 	 	,	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	my	work	is	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	a	photograph	of	the	 desk 	 top 	 	of	a	student	of	mine	.
and	when	i	say	 desk 	 top 	 	,	i	do	n't	just	mean	the	actual	desk	where	his	mouse	 ha 	 s 	 	worn	away	the	surface	of	the	desk	.
if	you	look	 care 	 fully 	 	,	you	can	even	see	a	hint	of	the	apple	menu	,	up	here	in	the	upper	left	,	where	the	virtual	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 punch 	 ed 	 	through	to	the	physical	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	joy	mountford	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	mouse	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 narrow 	 est 	 	straw	you	could	try	to	suck	all	of	human	 express 	 ion 	 	through	.	``
and	the	thing	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	 enabl 	 ing 	 	people	to	have	more	rich	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 inter 	 active 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
how	can	we	get	away	from	the	mouse	and	use	our	full	bodies	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	aesthetic	 experience 	 s 	 	,	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	 util 	 itarian 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
so	i	write	 soft 	 ware 	 	.	and	that	's	how	i	do	it	.
and	a	lot	of	my	 experience 	 s 	 	resemble	 mirror 	 s 	 	in	some	way	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	in	some	sense	,	the	first	way	,	that	people	discover	 the 	 ir 	 	own	potential	 a 	 s 	 	 act 	 ors 	 	,	and	discover	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 age 	 ncy 	 	.
by	 say 	 ing 	 	``	who	is	that	person	in	the	mirror	?	oh	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	me	.	``
and	so	,	to	give	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	from	last	year	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 inter 	 stit 	 ial 	 	fragment	processor	.
and	it	 allow 	 s 	 	people	to	explore	the	negative	 shape 	 s 	 	that	they	create	when	they	're	just	going	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 every 	 day 	 	business	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	people	make	 shape 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	,	or	with	each	other	,	these	 shape 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	produce	 sound 	 s 	 	and	drop	out	of	thin	air	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	taking	what	's	often	 th 	 is 	 	,	kind	of	,	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	space	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 detect 	 ed 	 	space	,	and	making	it	 some 	 thing 	 	real	,	that	people	then	can	appreciate	and	 be 	 come 	 	creative	with	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	people	discover	 the 	 ir 	 	creative	 age 	 ncy 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 personal 	 ities 	 	come	out	in	 total 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	ways	.
so	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	using	full	-	body	 in 	 put 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	've	 explore 	 d 	 	now	,	for	a	while	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	use	of	the	voice	,	which	is	an	 immense 	 ly 	 	 express 	 ive 	 	system	for	us	,	 vocal 	 izing 	 	.
song	is	one	of	our	 old 	 est 	 	ways	of	making	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	heard	and	 under 	 stood 	 	.
and	i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	research	by	wolfgang	k√∂hler	,	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	father	of	 gest 	 alt 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	from	1927	,	who	 submit 	 ted 	 	to	an	audience	like	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	two	 shape 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	one	of	them	is	 call 	 ed 	 	maluma	.
and	one	of	them	is	 call 	 ed 	 	taketa	.	which	is	which	?
 any 	 one 	 	want	to	hazard	a	guess	?
maluma	is	on	top	.	 yea 	 h 	 	.	so	.
 a 	 s 	 	he	 say 	 s 	 	here	,	most	people	answer	 with 	 out 	 	any	 hesit 	 ation 	 	.
so	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	which	is	a	kind	of	 synest 	 hesia 	 	that	all	of	you	have	.
and	so	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	dr.	oliver	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	one	person	in	a	million	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	true	 synest 	 hesia 	 	,	where	they	hear	 color 	 s 	 	or	taste	 shape 	 s 	 	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 phon 	 a 	 est 	 hesia 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	all	experience	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	.
it	's	about	 mapping 	 s 	 	between	different	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	 domain 	 s 	 	,	like	 hard 	 ness 	 	,	 sharp 	 ness 	 	,	 bright 	 ness 	 	and	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	and	the	 phone 	 me 	 s 	 	that	we	're	able	to	speak	with	.
so	70	 year 	 s 	 	on	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	some	research	where	cognitive	 psycho 	 logists 	 	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 us 	 s 	 ed 	 	out	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	to	which	,	you	know	,	l	,	m	and	b	are	more	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 shape 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	p	,	t	and	k	are	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 shape 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	here	we	 sudden 	 ly 	 	begin	to	have	a	mapping	between	 curv 	 ature 	 	that	we	can	exploit	 numeric 	 ally 	 	,	a	 relat 	 ive 	 	mapping	between	 curv 	 ature 	 	and	shape	.
so	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	we	could	run	these	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	?
and	thus	was	born	the	project	 call 	 ed 	 	remark	,	which	is	a	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	zachary	lieberman	and	the	ars	electronica	futurelab	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 inter 	 active 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	which	 present 	 s 	 	the	fiction	that	speech	 cast 	 s 	 	visible	 shadow 	 s 	 	.
so	the	idea	is	you	step	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	a	magic	light	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	,	you	see	the	 shadow 	 s 	 	of	your	own	speech	.
and	they	sort	of	fly	away	,	out	of	your	head	.
if	a	computer	speech	 re 	 cognition 	 	system	is	able	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	what	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	then	it	 spell 	 s 	 	it	out	.
and	if	it	is	n't	then	it	 produce 	 s 	 	a	shape	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 phon 	 aesthetic 	 ally 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	 couple 	 d 	 	to	the	 sound 	 s 	 	you	made	.
so	let	's	 br 	 ing 	 	up	a	video	of	that	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.	so	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	project	here	,	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	great	abstract	 vocal 	 ist 	 	,	jaap	blonk	.
and	he	is	a	world	expert	in	 perform 	 ing 	 	``	the	ursonate	,	``	which	is	a	half	-	an	-	hour	 non 	 sense 	 	poem	by	kurt	schwitters	,	written	in	the	1920s	,	which	is	half	an	hour	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 pattern 	 ed 	 	 non 	 sense 	 	.
and	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	perform	.
but	jaap	is	one	of	the	world	 expert 	 s 	 	in	 perform 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	form	of	intelligent	real	-	time	 sub 	 title 	 s 	 	.
so	these	are	our	live	 sub 	 title 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	by	a	computer	that	 know 	 s 	 	the	text	of	``	the	ursonate	``	--	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	jaap	 do 	 es 	 	too	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	--	and	it	is	 deliver 	 ing 	 	that	text	at	the	same	time	 a 	 s 	 	jaap	is	.
so	all	the	text	you	're	going	to	see	is	real	-	time	generated	by	the	computer	,	 visual 	 izing 	 	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	with	his	voice	.
here	you	can	see	the	set	-	up	where	there	is	a	screen	with	the	 sub 	 title 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	him	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	...
the	full	 video 	 s 	 	are	 on 	 line 	 	if	you	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
i	got	a	split	 re 	 action 	 	to	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	live	performance	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	some	people	who	understand	live	 sub 	 title 	 s 	 	are	a	kind	of	an	 oxy 	 moron 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	there	is	 some 	 one 	 	making	them	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
and	then	a	bunch	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	what	's	the	big	deal	?
i	see	 sub 	 title 	 s 	 	all	the	time	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	.	``
you	know	?	they	do	n't	imagine	the	person	in	the	booth	,	 ty 	 ping 	 	it	all	.
so	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	the	full	body	,	and	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	the	voice	,	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	most	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	is	the	use	of	the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	or	the	 gaz 	 e 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	how	people	 re 	 late 	 	to	each	other	.
it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	amount	of	 non 	 verbal 	 	information	that	's	 communicate 	 d 	 	with	the	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	one	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	technical	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	active	in	the	computer	 science 	 s 	 	:	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	have	a	camera	that	can	understand	,	from	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	big	distance	away	,	how	these	little	 tin 	 y 	 	 ball 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 point 	 ing 	 	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	to	reveal	what	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	and	where	your	attention	is	 direct 	 ed 	 	.
so	there	is	a	lot	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	communication	that	 happen 	 s 	 	there	.
and	so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	with	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	different	 project 	 s 	 	,	to	understand	how	people	can	 re 	 late 	 	to	 machine 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	to	ask	the	 question 	 s 	 	:	what	if	art	was	aware	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	it	?
how	could	it	respond	,	in	a	way	,	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	or	 sub 	 vert 	 	the	fact	that	we	're	looking	at	it	?
and	what	could	it	do	if	it	could	look	back	at	us	?
and	so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	next	 project 	 s 	 	.
in	the	first	one	which	i	'm	going	to	show	you	,	 call 	 ed 	 	eyecode	,	it	's	a	piece	of	 inter 	 active 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	in	which	,	if	we	read	 th 	 is 	 	little	circle	,	``	the	trace	left	by	the	looking	of	the	previous	 observ 	 er 	 	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	trace	left	by	the	looking	of	previous	 observ 	 er 	 	.	``
the	idea	is	that	it	's	an	image	 who 	 lly 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	from	 it 	 s 	 	own	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 view 	 ed 	 	by	different	people	in	an	 install 	 ation 	 	.
so	let	me	just	 s 	 witch 	 	over	so	we	can	do	the	live	demo	.
so	let	's	run	 th 	 is 	 	and	see	if	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	ah	,	there	is	 lot 	 s 	 	of	nice	bright	video	.
there	is	just	a	little	test	screen	that	 show 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	.
and	what	i	'm	just	going	to	do	is	--	i	'm	going	to	hide	that	.
and	you	can	see	here	that	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	is	it	's	 record 	 ing 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	every	time	i	blink	.
 hell 	 o 	 	?	and	i	can	...	 hell 	 o 	 	...	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
and	no	matter	where	i	am	,	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	here	is	that	it	's	an	eye	-	 track 	 ing 	 	system	that	tries	to	locate	my	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	if	i	get	 re 	 ally 	 	far	away	i	'm	 blur 	 ry 	 	.
you	know	,	you	're	going	to	have	these	kind	of	 blur 	 ry 	 	 spot 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	resemble	 eye 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	abstract	way	.
but	if	i	come	up	 re 	 ally 	 	close	and	 star 	 e 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	at	the	camera	on	 th 	 is 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	then	you	'll	see	these	nice	crisp	 eye 	 s 	 	.
you	can	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	,	sort	of	,	 ty 	 ping 	 	,	with	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	what	you	're	 ty 	 ping 	 	are	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	your	 eye 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	looking	at	other	 people 	 s 	 	'	 eye 	 s 	 	.
so	each	person	is	looking	at	the	looking	of	 every 	 one 	 	else	before	them	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	in	 large 	 r 	 	 install 	 ations 	 	where	there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 eye 	 s 	 	that	people	could	be	 star 	 ing 	 	at	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	who	's	looking	at	the	people	looking	at	the	people	looking	before	them	.
so	i	'll	just	add	a	couple	more	.	blink	.	blink	.
and	you	can	see	,	just	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	how	it	's	sort	of	 find 	 ing 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	best	to	estimate	when	it	's	 blink 	 ing 	 	.
 al 	 right 	 	.	let	's	 leav 	 e 	 	that	.
so	that	's	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 recur 	 s 	 ive 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	system	.
thank	you	.
the	last	couple	 piece 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	in	the	new	realm	of	 robotic 	 s 	 	--	for	me	,	new	for	me	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	opto	-	isolator	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	a	video	of	the	 old 	 er 	 	version	of	it	,	which	is	just	a	minute	long	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	opto	-	isolator	is	 blink 	 ing 	 	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	one	's	own	 blink 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 blink 	 s 	 	one	second	after	you	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 de 	 vice 	 	which	is	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	 gaz 	 e 	 	down	to	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	possible	 material 	 s 	 	.
just	one	eye	,	looking	at	you	,	and	 elimi 	 nating 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	about	a	face	,	but	just	to	consider	 gaz 	 e 	 	in	an	 isolate 	 d 	 	way	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	element	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	it	 attempt 	 s 	 	to	engage	in	what	you	might	call	familiar	psycho	-	social	 gaz 	 e 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
like	looking	away	if	you	look	at	it	too	long	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	 s 	 hy 	 	,	or	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	the	last	project	i	'm	going	to	show	is	 th 	 is 	 	new	one	 call 	 ed 	 	snout	.
it	's	an	eight	-	foot	snout	,	with	a	 go 	 og 	 ly 	 	eye	.
and	 in 	 side 	 	it	's	got	an	800	-	pound	robot	arm	that	i	 borrow 	 ed 	 	,	from	a	friend	.
it	 help 	 s 	 	to	have	good	 friend 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	at	carnegie	mellon	;	we	've	got	a	great	 robotic 	 s 	 	institute	there	.
i	'd	like	to	show	you	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	snout	,	which	is	--	the	idea	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	to	make	a	robot	that	 appear 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	 continu 	 ally 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	see	you	.
the	idea	is	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	if	it	's	 constant 	 ly 	 	like	``	huh	?	...	huh	?	``
that	's	why	 it 	 s 	 	other	name	is	doubletaker	,	taker	of	 double 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	kind	of	 do 	 ing 	 	a	double	take	:	``	what	?	``
and	the	idea	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	can	it	look	at	you	and	make	you	feel	 a 	 s 	 	if	like	,	``	what	?	is	it	my	 shoe 	 s 	 	?	``
``	got	 some 	 thing 	 	on	my	hair	?	``	here	we	go	.	 al 	 right 	 	.
 check 	 ing 	 	him	out	...
for	you	 nerd 	 s 	 	,	here	's	a	little	 be 	 hind 	 	-	the	-	 scene 	 s 	 	.
it	's	got	a	computer	vision	system	,	and	it	tries	to	look	at	the	people	who	are	moving	around	the	most	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 it 	 s 	 	 target 	 s 	 	.
