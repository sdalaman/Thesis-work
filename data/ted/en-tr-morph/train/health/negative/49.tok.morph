i	'm	going	to	present	three	 project 	 s 	 	in	rapid	fire	.
i	do	n't	have	much	time	to	do	it	.
and	i	want	to	reinforce	three	 idea 	 s 	 	with	that	rapid	-	fire	 present 	 ation 	 	.
the	first	is	what	i	like	to	call	a	hyper	-	rational	process	.
it	's	a	process	that	 take 	 s 	 	 rational 	 ity 	 	 al 	 most 	 	to	an	absurd	level	,	and	it	 transcend 	 s 	 	all	the	 bag 	 g 	 age 	 	that	 normal 	 ly 	 	 come 	 s 	 	with	what	people	would	call	,	sort	of	,	a	rational	 con 	 clusion 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	it	 conclude 	 s 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	see	here	,	that	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	would	n't	expect	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	result	of	 rational 	 ity 	 	.
the	second	--	the	second	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	process	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	a	signature	.
there	is	no	 author 	 ship 	 	.	 architect 	 s 	 	are	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 author 	 ship 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 edit 	 ing 	 	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 team 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	no	 long 	 er 	 	see	,	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	master	architect	creating	a	sketch	that	his	 min 	 ions 	 	carry	out	.
and	the	third	is	that	it	 challeng 	 es 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	in	the	length	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	support	why	,	connect	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	but	it	 challeng 	 es 	 	the	high	 modern 	 ist 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 flex 	 ibility 	 	.
high	 modern 	 ists 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	will	create	sort	of	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 	 space 	 s 	 	that	are	generic	.
 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	can	happen	 with 	 in 	 	them	.
i	call	it	sort	of	``	 shot 	 gun 	 	 flex 	 ibility 	 	.	``
turn	your	head	 th 	 is 	 	way	;	shoot	;	and	you	're	bound	to	kill	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	promise	of	high	 modern 	 ism 	 	:	 with 	 in 	 	a	single	space	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	any	kind	of	activity	can	happen	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	,	 operation 	 al 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	dwarf	capital	 cost 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	design	 parameter 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	idea	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	 what 	 ever 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	in	the	building	on	 open 	 ing 	 	day	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	the	most	 im 	 mediate 	 	need	,	 start 	 s 	 	to	dwarf	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	and	sort	of	 sub 	 s 	 ume 	 	it	,	of	 any 	 thing 	 	else	could	ever	happen	.
and	so	we	're	 pro 	 posing 	 	a	different	kind	of	 flex 	 ibility 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	call	``	 compartment 	 al 	 ized 	 	 flex 	 ibility 	 	.	``
and	the	idea	is	that	you	,	 with 	 in 	 	that	 continu 	 um 	 	,	identify	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 point 	 s 	 	,	and	you	design	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	them	.
they	can	be	 push 	 ed 	 	off	-	center	a	little	bit	,	but	in	the	end	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	still	get	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	that	original	spectrum	 a 	 s 	 	you	 original 	 ly 	 	had	 hop 	 ed 	 	.
with	high	 modern 	 ist 	 	 flex 	 ibility 	 	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	work	.
now	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	--	i	'm	going	to	build	up	the	seattle	central	library	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	before	your	 eye 	 s 	 	in	about	five	or	six	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 tru 	 ly 	 	mean	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	design	process	that	you	'll	see	.
with	the	library	staff	and	the	library	board	,	we	 settl 	 ed 	 	on	two	core	 position 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	one	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 show 	 ing 	 	,	over	the	last	900	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	evolution	of	the	book	and	other	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	was	our	sort	of	position	piece	about	the	book	,	and	our	position	was	,	 book 	 s 	 	are	technology	--	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	people	forget	--	but	it	's	a	form	of	technology	that	will	have	to	share	 it 	 s 	 	 domin 	 ance 	 	with	any	other	form	of	 tru 	 ly 	 	potent	technology	or	media	.
the	second	 pre 	 mise 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	for	us	to	 con 	 vince 	 	the	 librarian 	 s 	 	of	at	first	--	is	that	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	,	since	the	 in 	 ception 	 	of	carnegie	library	tradition	in	america	,	had	a	second	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	and	that	was	for	social	 role 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	i	'll	come	back	to	 lat 	 er 	 	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 librarian 	 s 	 	at	first	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	our	 man 	 date 	 	.
our	 man 	 date 	 	is	media	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	book	.	``
so	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	now	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	design	of	the	building	.
the	upper	 dia 	 gram 	 	is	what	we	had	 s 	 een 	 	in	a	whole	host	of	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	that	used	high	 modern 	 ist 	 	 flex 	 ibility 	 	.
sort	of	,	any	activity	could	happen	 any 	 where 	 	.
we	do	n't	know	the	future	of	the	library	;	we	do	n't	know	the	future	of	the	book	;	and	so	we	'll	use	 th 	 is 	 	approach	.
and	what	we	saw	 we 	 re 	 	 building 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	generic	.
and	,	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	we	see	 building 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	generic	--	so	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	the	 read 	 ing 	 	room	look	like	the	copy	room	look	like	the	magazine	area	--	but	it	 me 	 ant 	 	that	 what 	 ever 	 	issue	was	 trou 	 bling 	 	the	library	at	that	moment	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	engulf	every	other	activity	that	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	it	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	what	was	 get 	 ting 	 	 engulf 	 ed 	 	 we 	 re 	 	these	social	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	by	the	expansion	of	the	book	.
and	so	we	 pro 	 posed 	 	what	's	at	the	lower	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	dumb	approach	:	 simpl 	 y 	 	 compartment 	 al 	 ize 	 	.	put	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	evolution	we	could	predict	--	and	i	do	n't	mean	that	we	could	say	 what 	 ever 	 	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	happen	in	the	future	,	but	we	have	some	 certain 	 ty 	 	of	the	spectrum	of	 what 	 ever 	 	would	happen	in	the	future	--	put	 t 	 hose 	 	in	boxes	designed	 specific 	 ally 	 	for	it	,	and	put	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	ca	n't	predict	on	the	 roof 	 top 	 s 	 	.
so	that	was	the	core	idea	.
now	,	we	had	to	 con 	 vince 	 	the	library	that	social	 role 	 s 	 	was	 equal 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	media	in	order	to	get	them	to	accept	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	program	on	the	left	.
that	's	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	 give 	 n 	 	to	us	in	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	 clar 	 ity 	 	and	 glor 	 y 	 	.
our	first	operation	was	to	re	-	digest	it	back	to	them	,	show	it	to	them	and	say	,	``	you	know	what	?	we	have	n't	 touch 	 ed 	 	it	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	one	-	third	of	your	own	program	is	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	media	and	 book 	 s 	 	.
two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	it	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	--	that	's	the	white	band	 be 	 low 	 	--	the	thing	you	 s 	 aid 	 	is	n't	 import 	 ant 	 	--	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	social	 function 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	once	we	had	 present 	 ed 	 	that	back	to	them	,	they	 agree 	 d 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	core	 con 	 cept 	 	could	work	.
we	got	the	right	to	go	back	to	first	 principle 	 s 	 	--	that	's	the	third	 dia 	 gram 	 	.	we	 recombi 	 ned 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	then	we	 start 	 ed 	 	making	new	 decision 	 s 	 	.
what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	on	the	right	is	the	design	of	the	library	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	square	 foot 	 age 	 	.
on	the	left	of	that	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	here	,	you	'll	see	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	five	 platform 	 s 	 	--	sort	of	 comb 	 s 	 	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	 program 	 s 	 	.
and	on	the	right	are	the	more	 in 	 determi 	 n 	 ate 	 	 space 	 s 	 	;	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 read 	 ing 	 	rooms	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	evolution	in	20	,	30	,	40	 year 	 s 	 	we	ca	n't	predict	.
so	that	 liter 	 ally 	 	was	the	design	of	the	building	.
they	 sign 	 ed 	 	it	,	and	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 cha 	 grin 	 	,	we	came	back	a	week	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	we	 present 	 ed 	 	them	 th 	 is 	 	.
ok	?	and	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	on	the	right	.
ok	?	we	just	sized	--	no	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	i	mean	that	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
the	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	--	on	the	left	-	hand	side	of	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	boxes	.
we	sized	them	 in 	 to 	 	five	 compartment 	 s 	 	.
they	're	super	-	efficient	.	we	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	budget	to	work	with	.
we	 push 	 ed 	 	them	around	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	to	make	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 al 	 	contextual	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
the	 read 	 ing 	 	room	should	be	able	to	see	the	water	.
the	main	 en 	 trance 	 	should	have	a	public	plaza	in	front	of	it	to	 ab 	 ide 	 	by	the	 zon 	 ing 	 	code	,	and	so	forth	.
so	,	you	see	the	five	 platform 	 s 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	boxes	--	 with 	 in 	 	each	one	a	 ver 	 y 	 	discrete	thing	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
the	area	in	between	is	sort	of	an	urban	 continu 	 um 	 	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	ca	n't	predict	 the 	 ir 	 	evolution	to	the	same	degree	.
to	give	you	some	sense	of	the	power	of	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	block	is	what	we	call	the	book	spiral	.
it	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	built	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 	way	--	it	is	a	 park 	 ing 	 	 gar 	 age 	 	for	 book 	 s 	 	.
it	just	so	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	in	the	sixth	through	10th	floor	of	the	building	,	but	that	is	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	an	expensive	approach	.
and	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	organize	the	entire	dewey	decimal	system	on	one	 continu 	 ous 	 	run	:	no	matter	how	it	 grow 	 s 	 	or	 contract 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	building	,	it	will	 al 	 ways 	 	have	 it 	 s 	 	 clar 	 ity 	 	to	end	the	sort	of	trail	of	 tear 	 s 	 	that	we	've	all	 experience 	 d 	 	in	public	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	final	operation	,	which	was	to	take	these	 block 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 push 	 ed 	 	off	kilter	,	and	to	hold	onto	them	with	a	skin	.
that	skin	 serve 	 s 	 	double	duty	,	 aga 	 in 	 	for	 economic 	 s 	 	.
one	,	it	is	the	lateral	 st 	 ability 	 	for	the	entire	building	;	it	is	a	structural	element	.	but	 it 	 s 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	designed	not	 on 	 ly 	 	for	structure	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	for	 hold 	 ing 	 	on	every	piece	of	glass	.
the	glass	was	then	--	i	'll	just	use	the	word	 impregnate 	 d 	 	--	but	it	had	a	layer	of	metal	that	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 stress 	 ed 	 	metal	.	``
that	metal	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	micro	 lou 	 ver 	 	,	so	from	the	 ex 	 terior 	 	of	the	building	the	 s 	 un 	 	 s 	 ees 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 opa 	 que 	 	,	but	from	the	 in 	 terior 	 	it	's	 entire 	 ly 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	.
so	,	now	i	'm	going	to	take	you	on	a	tour	of	the	building	.
let	's	see	if	i	can	find	it	.	for	 any 	 one 	 	who	is	--	 get 	 s 	 	motion	 sick 	 ness 	 	,	i	 apolog 	 ize 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	building	.
and	i	think	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	is	,	when	we	first	 unveil 	 ed 	 	the	building	,	the	public	thought	--	saw	it	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	about	our	whim	and	ego	.
and	it	was	 defend 	 ed 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	by	the	 librarian 	 s 	 	.	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	we	do	n't	know	what	it	is	,	but	we	know	it	's	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	need	it	to	be	based	on	the	 observ 	 ations 	 	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	about	the	program	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	the	 ent 	 ries 	 	.
so	it	's	an	 un 	 usual 	 	building	for	a	public	library	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
so	now	we	're	going	 in 	 to 	 	what	we	call	the	 read 	 ing 	 	room	--	sorry	,	living	room	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	program	that	we	 invent 	 ed 	 	with	the	library	.
it	was	 recogn 	 izing 	 	that	public	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	are	the	last	 vest 	 ige 	 	of	public	free	space	.
there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 shop 	 ping 	 	 mall 	 s 	 	that	allow	you	to	get	out	of	the	rain	in	 down 	 town 	 	seattle	,	but	there	are	not	so	 man 	 y 	 	free	 place 	 s 	 	that	allow	you	to	get	out	of	the	rain	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 un 	 programm 	 ed 	 	area	where	people	could	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	do	 any 	 thing 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	eat	,	yell	,	play	 ches 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
now	we	're	moving	up	 in 	 to 	 	what	we	call	the	 mix 	 ing 	 	chamber	.
that	was	the	main	sort	of	technology	area	in	the	building	.
you	'll	have	to	tell	me	if	i	'm	going	too	fast	for	you	.
now	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	place	that	we	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	building	so	i	could	 pro 	 pose 	 	to	my	wife	.	right	there	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	.
i	'm	running	out	of	time	,	so	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	stop	.
i	can	show	 th 	 is 	 	to	you	 lat 	 er 	 	.
but	let	's	see	if	i	can	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	book	spiral	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	's	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	most	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	main	 read 	 ing 	 	room	--	the	most	 un 	 ique 	 	part	of	the	building	.
you	dizzy	yet	?
ok	,	so	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	book	spiral	.
so	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 discern 	 ible 	 	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	stair	 step 	 ping 	 	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	,	on	one	city	block	,	go	up	one	full	floor	,	so	that	it	's	on	a	 continu 	 um 	 	.
ok	,	now	i	'm	going	to	go	back	,	and	so	i	'm	going	to	hit	a	second	project	.
i	'm	going	to	go	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	dallas	theater	.	it	was	an	 un 	 usual 	 	client	for	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	came	to	us	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	need	you	to	do	a	new	building	.	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	a	 tempor 	 ary 	 	space	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	 tempor 	 ary 	 	space	,	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	an	 in 	 famous 	 	theater	company	.
theater	is	 re 	 ally 	 	focused	in	new	york	,	chicago	and	seattle	,	with	the	exception	of	the	dallas	theater	company	.	``
and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	fact	that	they	 work 	 ed 	 	on	a	 pro 	 vision 	 al 	 	space	 me 	 ant 	 	that	for	beckett	they	could	blow	out	a	wall	;	they	could	do	``	 cher 	 ry 	 	 orc 	 hard 	 	``	and	blow	a	hole	through	the	floor	,	and	so	forth	.
so	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 daunt 	 ing 	 	task	for	us	to	do	a	brand	-	new	building	that	could	keep	the	--	be	a	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	building	,	but	keep	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 experiment 	 al 	 	nature	.
and	the	second	is	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	what	we	call	a	multi	-	form	theater	:	they	do	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 performance 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 pert 	 ory 	 	.
so	they	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	will	do	 some 	 thing 	 	in	arena	,	then	they	'll	do	 some 	 thing 	 	in	 pro 	 scen 	 ium 	 	and	so	forth	.
and	so	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	 quick 	 ly 	 	transform	between	different	theater	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	and	for	 operation 	 al 	 	budget	 reason 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	any	multi	-	form	theater	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	so	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	a	way	to	 over 	 come 	 	that	.
so	our	thought	was	to	 liter 	 ally 	 	put	the	theater	on	 it 	 s 	 	head	:	to	take	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 previous 	 ly 	 	defined	 a 	 s 	 	front	-	of	-	house	and	back	-	of	-	house	and	stack	them	--	above	house	and	 be 	 low 	 	house	--	and	to	create	sort	of	what	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	call	a	theater	machine	.
we	invest	the	money	in	the	operation	of	the	building	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	building	could	be	 place 	 d 	 	 any 	 where 	 	:	 where 	 ver 	 	you	place	it	,	the	area	 under 	 neath 	 	it	is	charged	for	 the 	 a 	 tric 	 al 	 	 performance 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	go	back	to	first	 principle 	 s 	 	,	and	 re 	 define 	 	fly	tower	,	acoustic	 en 	 closure 	 	,	light	 en 	 closure 	 	and	so	forth	.
and	at	the	push	of	a	button	,	it	 allow 	 s 	 	the	 art 	 istic 	 	director	to	move	between	 pro 	 scen 	 ium 	 	thrust	and	,	in	fact	,	arena	and	 tra 	 verse 	 	and	flat	floor	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	 trans 	 figur 	 ation 	 	.
so	in	fact	,	we	can	go	,	using	 operation 	 al 	 	budget	,	we	can	--	sorry	,	capital	cost	--	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	what	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	 achiev 	 able 	 	in	 operation 	 al 	 	cost	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 art 	 istic 	 	director	now	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 pal 	 ette 	 	that	he	or	she	can	 choos 	 e 	 	from	between	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 form 	 s 	 	and	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 process 	 ions 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	 en 	 closure 	 	around	the	theater	that	is	 normal 	 ly 	 	trapped	with	front	-	of	-	house	and	back	-	of	-	house	 space 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 liberate 	 d 	 	.
so	an	 art 	 istic 	 	director	 ha 	 s 	 	the	ability	to	show	--	have	a	performance	that	 enter 	 s 	 	in	a	wagnerian	 process 	 ion 	 	,	 show 	 s 	 	the	first	act	in	thrust	,	the	 inter 	 mission 	 	in	a	greek	 process 	 ion 	 	,	second	act	in	arena	,	and	so	forth	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	what	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	theater	up	close	.
any	 port 	 ion 	 	around	the	theater	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	be	 open 	 ed 	 	 discrete 	 ly 	 	.
the	light	 en 	 closure 	 	can	be	 lift 	 ed 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	to	the	acoustic	 en 	 closure 	 	,	so	you	can	do	beckett	with	dallas	 a 	 s 	 	the	 back 	 drop 	 	.
 port 	 ions 	 	can	be	 open 	 ed 	 	,	so	you	can	now	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 motor 	 cycle 	 s 	 	drive	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	performance	,	or	you	can	even	just	have	an	open	-	air	performance	,	or	for	 inter 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
the	 balc 	 onies 	 	all	move	to	go	between	 t 	 hose 	 	 configu 	 ration 	 s 	 	,	but	they	 al 	 so 	 	disappear	.
the	 pro 	 scen 	 ium 	 	line	can	 al 	 so 	 	disappear	.
you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	enormous	 object 	 s 	 	in	,	so	in	fact	 the 	 ir 	 	--	the	dallas	theater	company	--	 the 	 ir 	 	first	show	will	be	a	play	about	charles	lindbergh	,	and	they	'll	want	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	[	a	]	real	 air 	 craft 	 	.
and	then	it	 al 	 so 	 	 provide 	 s 	 	them	,	in	the	off	-	season	,	the	ability	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	rent	out	 the 	 ir 	 	space	for	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	it	at	night	--	sorry	,	from	a	distance	.
open	up	entire	 port 	 ions 	 	for	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 event 	 s 	 	.
and	at	night	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 re 	 move 	 	the	light	 en 	 closure 	 	;	keep	the	acoustic	 en 	 closure 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 mon 	 ster 	 	truck	show	.
i	'm	going	to	show	now	the	last	project	.
 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	is	an	 un 	 usual 	 	client	.
they	 in 	 vert 	 ed 	 	the	whole	idea	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
they	came	to	us	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	--	 un 	 like 	 	normal	 develop 	 ers 	 	--	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	want	to	start	out	by	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	a	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	museum	in	louisville	.	that	's	our	main	goal	.	``
and	so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 develop 	 er 	 	that	 s 	 ees 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	money	,	they	saw	an	ability	to	be	a	catalyst	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 down 	 town 	 	.
and	the	fact	that	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	support	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	museum	 actual 	 ly 	 	built	 the 	 ir 	 	pro	 form 	 a 	 	,	so	they	 work 	 ed 	 	in	reverse	.
and	that	pro	 form 	 a 	 	led	us	to	a	 mix 	 ed 	 	-	use	building	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	large	in	order	to	support	 the 	 ir 	 	 aspir 	 ations 	 	of	the	art	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	up	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	the	art	 it 	 self 	 	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	,	interact	with	commercial	 space 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	more	and	more	want	to	work	 with 	 in 	 	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	charged	us	with	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	both	a	single	building	and	a	credible	sort	of	sub	-	building	.
so	now	i	'm	going	to	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	louisville	's	 sky 	 line 	 	--	and	i	'm	going	to	take	you	through	 vari 	 ous 	 	 constraint 	 s 	 	that	led	to	the	project	.
first	:	the	physical	 constraint 	 s 	 	.	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	on	three	discrete	 s 	 ites 	 	,	all	of	them	well	,	well	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	building	.
we	had	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	next	to	the	new	muhammad	ali	center	,	and	respect	it	.
we	had	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	100	-	year	 flood 	 plain 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	area	 flood 	 s 	 	three	to	four	 time 	 s 	 	a	year	,	and	there	's	a	levee	 be 	 hind 	 	our	 s 	 ite 	 	similar	to	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	broke	in	new	orleans	.
have	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	i	-	64	corridor	,	a	street	that	 cut 	 s 	 	through	the	middle	of	these	 separat 	 e 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	.
so	these	--	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	build	a	sort	of	nightmare	of	 constraint 	 s 	 	in	a	 bath 	 tub 	 	.
 under 	 neath 	 	the	 bath 	 tub 	 	are	the	city	's	main	power	lines	.
and	there	is	a	pedestrian	corridor	that	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	add	that	would	link	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	cultural	 building 	 s 	 	,	and	a	view	corridor	--	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	historic	 di 	 strict 	 	--	that	they	did	n't	want	to	obstruct	with	the	new	building	.
and	now	we	're	going	to	add	1.1	million	square	feet	.
and	if	we	did	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	thing	,	that	1.1	million	square	feet	--	these	are	the	different	 program 	 s 	 	--	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	thing	would	be	to	identify	the	public	 element 	 s 	 	,	place	them	on	 s 	 ites 	 	,	and	now	we	'd	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	:	a	public	thing	in	the	middle	of	a	 bath 	 tub 	 	that	 flood 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	would	 s 	 ize 	 	all	the	other	 element 	 s 	 	--	the	different	commercial	 element 	 s 	 	:	hotel	,	 luxur 	 y 	 	housing	,	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	--	and	dump	it	on	top	.	and	we	would	create	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 un 	 vi 	 able 	 	.
in	fact	--	and	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	time	warner	building	.
so	our	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
just	lift	the	entire	block	,	flip	some	of	the	 element 	 s 	 	over	,	 re 	 position 	 	them	so	they	have	appropriate	 view 	 s 	 	and	 relationship 	 s 	 	to	 down 	 town 	 	,	and	make	 circul 	 ation 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	and	 re 	 route 	 	the	road	.
so	that	's	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	and	now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	what	it	 lead 	 s 	 	to	.
ok	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 form 	 al 	 	,	 will 	 ful 	 	 gest 	 ure 	 	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	derived	 entire 	 ly 	 	out	of	the	 constraint 	 s 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	when	we	 unveil 	 ed 	 	it	,	there	was	a	sort	of	 nervous 	 ness 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	about	an	architect	making	a	 state 	 ment 	 	,	not	an	architect	who	was	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	solve	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 with 	 in 	 	that	center	zone	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	have	the	ability	to	mix	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	here	you	can	see	that	these	--	 th 	 is 	 	--	sort	of	an	x	-	ray	--	the	 tower 	 s 	 	are	 total 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 er 	 	-	driven	.	they	told	us	the	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	the	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	and	we	focused	on	taking	all	the	public	 component 	 s 	 	--	the	 lobbi 	 es 	 	,	the	 bar 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	the	different	commercial	 element 	 s 	 	would	have	--	and	 combine 	 d 	 	it	in	the	center	,	in	the	sort	of	 sub 	 way 	 	map	,	in	the	transfer	zone	that	would	 al 	 so 	 	include	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	museum	.
so	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	you	have	 artist 	 s 	 	who	can	 oper 	 ate 	 	 with 	 in 	 	an	art	space	that	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	view	on	the	22nd	floor	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 proxim 	 ity 	 	that	the	 cur 	 ator 	 	can	either	open	or	close	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	people	on	 exercis 	 e 	 	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	or	to	see	the	art	,	and	so	forth	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	if	an	artist	 want 	 s 	 	to	 invad 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	 swimm 	 ing 	 	pool	,	they	can	begin	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	in	a	 swimm 	 ing 	 	pool	,	so	they	're	not	 force 	 d 	 	to	 al 	 ways 	 	work	 with 	 in 	 	the	 con 	 fine 	 s 	 	of	a	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 gall 	 ery 	 	space	.
so	,	how	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	:	it	's	a	chair	.
so	,	we	begin	by	building	the	 core 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	're	building	the	 core 	 s 	 	,	we	build	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	museum	at	grade	.
that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	have	 in 	 credible 	 	efficiency	and	cost	efficiency	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	high	-	budget	building	.
the	moment	the	 core 	 s 	 	get	to	mid	level	,	we	finish	the	art	museum	;	we	put	all	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	in	it	;	and	then	we	jack	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	they	build	 re 	 ally 	 	large	 air 	 craft 	 	 hang 	 ar 	 s 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	they	did	for	the	a	380	.
finish	the	 core 	 s 	 	,	finish	the	meat	and	you	get	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	i	 on 	 ly 	 	have	about	30	 second 	 s 	 	,	so	i	want	to	start	an	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	and	we	'll	conclude	with	that	.	thank	you	.
chris	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	add	--	the	theater	is	under	construction	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	project	will	start	construction	in	about	a	year	,	and	finish	in	2010	.
