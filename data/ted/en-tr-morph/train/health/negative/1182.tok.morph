is	an	old	,	 elev 	 ated 	 	rail	line	that	 run 	 s 	 	for	a	mile	and	a	half	right	through	manhattan	.
and	it	was	 original 	 ly 	 	a	 fr 	 eight 	 	line	that	ran	down	10th	ave	.
and	it	 be 	 came 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	``	death	 a 	 venue 	 	``	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	run	over	by	the	 train 	 s 	 	that	the	 rail 	 road 	 	 hire 	 d 	 	a	guy	on	 horse 	 back 	 	to	run	in	front	,	and	he	 be 	 came 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	west	side	 cow 	 boy 	 	.	``
but	even	with	a	 cow 	 boy 	 	,	about	one	person	a	month	was	 kill 	 ed 	 	and	run	over	.
so	they	 elev 	 ated 	 	it	.
they	built	it	30	ft.	in	the	air	,	right	through	the	middle	of	the	city	.
but	with	the	rise	of	 inter 	 state 	 	 truck 	 ing 	 	,	it	was	used	less	and	less	.
and	by	1980	,	the	last	train	 rod 	 e 	 	.
it	was	a	train	 load 	 ed 	 	with	 froze 	 n 	 	 tur 	 key 	 s 	 	--	they	say	,	at	 thank 	 s 	 giving 	 	--	and	then	it	was	 abandon 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	live	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	and	i	first	read	about	it	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	in	an	article	that	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	going	to	be	 demolish 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	 assum 	 ed 	 	 some 	 one 	 	was	 work 	 ing 	 	to	preserve	it	or	 s 	 ave 	 	it	and	i	could	volunteer	,	but	i	 real 	 ized 	 	no	one	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	went	to	my	first	community	board	 meet 	 ing 	 	--	which	i	'd	never	 be 	 en 	 	to	one	before	--	and	 s 	 at 	 	next	to	 an 	 other 	 	guy	named	joshua	david	,	who	's	a	travel	writer	.
and	at	the	end	of	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	two	people	that	 we 	 re 	 	sort	of	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	project	;	most	people	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tear	it	down	.
so	we	 ex 	 change 	 d 	 	business	 card 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	each	other	and	 decide 	 d 	 	to	start	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	 friend 	 s 	 	of	the	high	line	.
and	the	goal	at	first	was	just	saving	it	from	 demo 	 lit 	 ion 	 	,	but	then	we	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	what	we	could	do	with	it	.
and	what	first	 attract 	 ed 	 	me	,	or	 interest 	 ed 	 	me	,	was	 th 	 is 	 	view	from	the	street	--	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	steel	structure	,	sort	of	 rust 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	industrial	 re 	 lic 	 	.
but	when	i	went	up	on	top	,	it	was	a	mile	and	a	half	of	 wild 	 flower 	 s 	 	running	right	through	the	middle	of	manhattan	with	 view 	 s 	 	of	the	empire	state	building	and	the	statue	of	 liber 	 ty 	 	and	the	hudson	river	.
and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	where	we	 start 	 ed 	 	,	the	idea	 coalesce 	 d 	 	around	,	let	's	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	park	,	and	let	's	have	it	be	sort	of	inspired	by	 th 	 is 	 	 wild 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
at	the	time	,	there	was	a	lot	of	 op 	 position 	 	.
mayor	giuliani	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tear	it	down	.
i	'm	going	to	fast	-	forward	through	a	lot	of	 law 	 suit 	 s 	 	and	a	lot	of	community	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
mayor	bloomberg	came	in	 off 	 ice 	 	,	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 support 	 ive 	 	,	but	we	still	had	to	make	the	economic	case	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	after	9/11	;	the	city	was	in	tough	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 commission 	 ed 	 	an	economic	 feas 	 ibility 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	to	try	to	make	the	case	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	we	got	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	wrong	.
we	thought	it	would	cost	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	build	.
so	far	it	's	cost	about	150	million	.
and	the	main	case	was	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	make	good	economic	sense	for	the	city	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	over	a	20	-	year	time	period	,	the	value	to	the	city	in	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	 value 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 tax 	 es 	 	would	be	about	250	million	.
that	was	 en 	 ough 	 	.	it	 re 	 ally 	 	got	the	city	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	 we 	 re 	 	wrong	on	that	.
now	people	estimate	it	's	 create 	 d 	 	about	a	half	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	or	will	create	about	a	half	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	in	tax	 revenue 	 s 	 	for	the	city	.
we	did	a	design	 com 	 petition 	 	,	 select 	 ed 	 	a	design	team	.
we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	them	to	 re 	 ally 	 	create	a	design	that	was	inspired	by	that	 wild 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
there	's	three	 section 	 s 	 	.
we	 open 	 ed 	 	the	fist	section	in	2009	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	beyond	our	 dream 	 s 	 	.
last	year	we	had	about	two	million	people	,	which	is	about	10	 time 	 s 	 	what	we	ever	 estimate 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	in	section	one	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 amphi 	 theater 	 	right	over	10th	ave	.
and	the	first	section	 end 	 s 	 	at	20th	st.	right	now	.
the	other	thing	,	it	's	generated	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	economic	value	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	inspired	,	i	think	,	a	lot	of	great	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
there	's	a	point	,	you	can	stand	here	and	see	 building 	 s 	 	by	frank	gehry	,	jean	nouvel	,	shigeru	ban	,	neil	denari	.
and	the	whitney	is	moving	 down 	 town 	 	and	is	building	 the 	 ir 	 	new	museum	right	at	the	base	of	the	high	line	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	designed	by	renzo	piano	.
and	they	're	going	to	break	ground	in	may	.
and	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	construction	on	section	two	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 fly 	 over 	 	where	you	're	eight	feet	off	the	surface	of	the	high	line	,	running	through	a	 can 	 opy 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	.
the	high	line	used	to	be	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	 bill 	 board 	 s 	 	,	and	so	we	've	taken	a	 play 	 ful 	 	take	where	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	framing	 advertise 	 ments 	 	,	it	's	going	to	frame	people	in	 view 	 s 	 	of	the	city	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	just	 install 	 ed 	 	last	month	.
and	then	the	last	section	was	going	to	go	around	the	rail	 yard 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	largest	 un 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	in	manhattan	.
and	the	city	 ha 	 s 	 	 plan 	 ned 	 	--	for	better	or	for	 wo 	 rse 	 	--	12	million	square	-	feet	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	that	the	high	line	is	going	to	ring	around	.
but	what	 re 	 ally 	 	,	i	think	,	 make 	 s 	 	the	high	line	special	is	the	people	.
and	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	love	the	 design 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	building	,	i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 frighten 	 ed 	 	that	i	would	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	love	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	fell	in	love	with	that	 wild 	 s 	 cape 	 	--	and	how	could	you	 re 	 create 	 	that	magic	?
but	what	i	found	is	it	's	in	the	people	and	how	they	use	it	that	,	to	me	,	 make 	 s 	 	it	so	special	.
just	one	quick	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	i	 real 	 ized 	 	right	after	we	 open 	 ed 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	all	these	people	 hold 	 ing 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	the	high	line	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	new	yorkers	do	n't	hold	 hand 	 s 	 	;	we	just	do	n't	do	that	 out 	 side 	 	.
but	you	see	that	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	high	line	,	and	i	think	that	's	the	power	that	public	space	can	have	to	transform	how	people	experience	 the 	 ir 	 	city	and	interact	with	each	other	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
