when	i	was	little	--	and	by	the	way	,	i	was	little	once	--	my	father	told	me	a	story	about	an	18th	century	 watch 	 maker 	 	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	guy	had	 d 	 one 	 	:	he	used	to	produce	these	 fabulous 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 watch 	 es 	 	.
and	one	day	,	one	of	his	 custom 	 ers 	 	came	 in 	 to 	 	his	 work 	 shop 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	to	clean	the	watch	that	he	'd	 b 	 ought 	 	.
and	the	guy	took	it	 a 	 part 	 	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	was	one	of	the	balance	 wheel 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	he	did	so	,	his	 custom 	 er 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	that	on	the	back	side	of	the	balance	wheel	was	an	 engrav 	 ing 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 word 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	guy	,	``	why	have	you	put	stuff	on	the	back	that	no	one	will	ever	see	?	``
and	the	 watch 	 maker 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	god	can	see	it	.	``
now	i	'm	not	in	the	 l 	 east 	 	bit	religious	,	 n 	 either 	 	was	my	father	,	but	at	that	point	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.
i	felt	 some 	 thing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 plex 	 us 	 	of	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	and	 nerve 	 s 	 	,	and	there	must	be	some	 muscle 	 s 	 	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	 some 	 where 	 	,	i	guess	.
but	i	felt	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	it	was	a	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
and	from	that	point	on	,	from	my	age	at	the	time	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	different	way	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	took	on	my	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	the	simple	question	:	do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	or	do	we	feel	it	?
now	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	,	well	,	i	do	n't	know	which	one	you	think	it	is	,	but	i	think	it	's	about	 feel 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
and	so	i	then	 move 	 d 	 	on	 in 	 to 	 	my	design	 care 	 er 	 	and	 beg 	 an 	 	to	find	some	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	most	early	work	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	 auto 	 motive 	 	design	--	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	work	was	 d 	 one 	 	there	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	we	found	 some 	 thing 	 	,	or	i	found	 some 	 thing 	 	,	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	me	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	remember	it	.
do	you	remember	when	 light 	 s 	 	used	to	just	go	on	and	off	,	click	click	,	when	you	closed	the	door	in	a	car	?
and	then	 some 	 body 	 	,	i	think	it	was	bmw	,	 introduc 	 ed 	 	a	light	that	went	out	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
remember	that	?
i	remember	it	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
do	you	remember	the	first	time	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	car	and	it	did	that	?
i	remember	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	fantastic	.
in	fact	,	i	've	never	found	 any 	 body 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	like	the	light	that	 go 	 es 	 	out	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
i	thought	,	well	what	the	hell	's	that	about	?
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	 question 	 s 	 	about	it	.
and	the	first	was	,	i	'd	ask	other	people	:	``	do	you	like	it	?	``	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
``	why	?	``	and	they	'd	say	,	``	oh	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	so	natural	,	``	or	,	``	it	's	nice	.	``
i	thought	,	well	that	's	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
can	we	cut	down	a	little	bit	further	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	i	need	the	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	,	i	need	the	 key 	 board 	 	,	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	did	some	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	--	light	to	dark	in	six	 second 	 s 	 	--	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	.
do	you	know	what	it	is	?	 any 	 one 	 	?
you	see	,	using	 th 	 is 	 	bit	,	the	 think 	 y 	 	bit	,	the	 s 	 low 	 	bit	of	the	brain	--	using	that	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	a	think	,	it	's	a	feel	.
and	would	you	do	me	a	favor	?
for	the	next	14	 minute 	 s 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	will	you	feel	stuff	?
i	do	n't	need	you	to	think	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	i	want	you	to	feel	it	.
i	felt	a	sense	of	 relax 	 ation 	 	 temper 	 ed 	 	with	 anticip 	 ation 	 	.
and	that	thing	that	i	found	was	the	cinema	or	the	theater	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	--	light	to	dark	in	six	 second 	 s 	 	.
and	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	are	you	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	going	,	``	no	,	the	movie	's	about	to	start	,	``	or	are	you	going	,	``	that	's	fantastic	.	i	'm	looking	forward	to	it	.
i	get	a	sense	of	 anticip 	 ation 	 	``	?
now	i	'm	not	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	even	if	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 condition 	 ed 	 	 re 	 flex 	 	.
but	it	might	be	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	people	i	speak	to	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	that	used	to	go	in	the	cinema	get	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	some	of	the	people	i	speak	to	that	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	movie	or	 be 	 en 	 	to	the	theater	do	n't	get	it	in	the	same	way	.
 every 	 body 	 	 like 	 s 	 	it	,	but	some	like	it	more	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	different	way	.
we	're	not	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	.	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	in	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	--	if	that	's	not	an	 out 	 mod 	 ed 	 	idea	.
these	are	the	bits	,	the	pleasure	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	what	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	and	 sens 	 ing 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	is	 bypass 	 ing 	 	my	 think 	 ing 	 	.
the	wiring	from	your	 sensor 	 y 	 	apparatus	to	 t 	 hose 	 	bits	is	 short 	 er 	 	than	the	bits	that	have	to	pass	through	the	 think 	 y 	 	bit	,	the	cortex	.
they	 arriv 	 e 	 	first	.
so	how	do	we	make	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	?
and	how	much	of	that	 re 	 active 	 	side	of	it	is	due	to	what	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	,	or	what	we	're	going	to	learn	,	about	 some 	 thing 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	i	know	.
it	's	a	plastic	bag	.
and	when	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	first	,	i	thought	,	no	,	there	's	no	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	that	.
then	i	found	out	,	post	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	bag	if	i	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 filth 	 y 	 	 pudd 	 le 	 	or	a	stream	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 coli 	 form 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 disgust 	 ing 	 	stuff	,	that	that	 filth 	 y 	 	water	will	 migr 	 ate 	 	through	the	wall	of	the	bag	by	osmosis	and	end	up	 in 	 side 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	,	 pot 	 able 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	,	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	bag	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	me	.
now	i	'm	going	to	ask	you	 aga 	 in 	 	to	 s 	 witch 	 	on	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	bit	.
would	you	mind	taking	the	brain	out	,	and	i	just	want	you	to	feel	 some 	 thing 	 	.
look	at	that	.	what	are	you	 feel 	 ing 	 	about	it	?
is	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	?	is	it	 excit 	 ing 	 	?
i	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
there	's	some	 ra 	 ther 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	-	looking	 gentle 	 men 	 	and	some	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	-	looking	 lad 	 ies 	 	who	are	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	 some 	 thing 	 	off	that	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	's	an	 innoc 	 ence 	 	to	it	.
now	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	it	is	.	are	you	ready	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	act	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	of	a	little	girl	 call 	 ed 	 	heidi	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	before	she	 di 	 ed 	 	of	cancer	to	the	 s 	 pine 	 	.
it	's	the	last	thing	she	did	,	the	last	physical	act	.
look	at	that	picture	.
look	at	the	 innoc 	 ence 	 	.	look	at	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	it	.
is	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	now	?
stop	.	stop	.	how	do	you	feel	?
where	are	you	 feel 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
i	'm	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	here	.	i	feel	it	here	.
and	i	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	 some 	 thing 	 	.
the	 lad 	 y 	 	over	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	,	by	the	way	.
but	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
i	watch	what	people	do	.
i	watch	 face 	 s 	 	.
i	watch	 react 	 ions 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	to	know	how	people	react	to	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	most	common	 face 	 s 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	 face 	 d 	 	with	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 stupefy 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 delic 	 ious 	 	,	is	what	i	call	the	omg	.
and	by	the	way	,	there	's	no	pleasure	in	that	face	.
it	's	not	a	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	!	``
the	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 de 	 focused 	 	,	and	the	mouth	is	 hang 	 ing 	 	open	.
that	's	not	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	joy	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	in	that	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	weird	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
so	pleasure	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 temper 	 ed 	 	by	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	coming	in	.
poignancy	is	a	word	i	love	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 trigger 	 ing 	 	a	big	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	often	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 s 	 ad 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	part	of	what	we	do	.
it	is	n't	just	about	nice	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	dilemma	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	paradox	,	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
sensorily	,	we	're	taking	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 mix 	 ture 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	good	,	bad	,	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	 frighten 	 ing 	 	--	to	come	up	with	that	 sensor 	 ial 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	that	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	what	's	going	on	.
pathos	 appear 	 s 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	what	you	just	saw	in	that	little	girl	's	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	triumph	,	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	``	i	never	 k 	 new 	 	that	.	ah	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.	``
and	that	's	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	assemble	these	 tool 	 s 	 	,	from	a	design	point	of	view	,	i	get	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	they	're	 arriv 	 ing 	 	at	the	brain	,	it	would	seem	,	before	cognition	,	before	we	can	 manipul 	 ate 	 	them	--	 electro 	 chemical 	 	party	 trick 	 s 	 	.
now	what	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	:	is	it	possible	to	 separat 	 e 	 	intrinsic	and	 extr 	 in 	 s 	 ic 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	?
by	that	,	i	mean	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	just	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	that	's	 universal 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	find	.	 may 	 be 	 	you	've	got	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	find	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	to	 every 	 body 	 	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	certain	amount	of	information	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	there	before	.
so	a	lot	of	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	 extr 	 in 	 s 	 ic 	 	.
it	's	 mediate 	 d 	 	by	information	before	the	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	.
or	the	information	's	 add 	 ed 	 	on	at	the	back	,	like	that	little	girl	's	 draw 	 ing 	 	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
now	when	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 beaut 	 y 	 	you	ca	n't	get	away	from	the	fact	that	a	lot	 experiment 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	with	 face 	 s 	 	and	what	have	you	.
and	one	of	the	most	 ted 	 ious 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	was	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 beaut 	 y 	 	was	about	symmetry	.
well	it	 obvious 	 ly 	 	is	n't	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	one	where	half	 face 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	some	people	,	and	then	to	add	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	list	of	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	 l 	 east 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	then	 ex 	 posing 	 	a	full	face	.
and	they	found	that	it	was	 al 	 most 	 	exact	 co 	 incidence 	 	.
so	it	was	n't	about	symmetry	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 a 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	face	,	of	which	both	 side 	 s 	 	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
but	they	're	both	different	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	i	ca	n't	help	 meddl 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	i	 pull 	 ed 	 	it	to	bits	and	sort	of	did	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	what	the	individual	 element 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	but	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	i	go	.
now	i	can	feel	a	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	 de 	 light 	 	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	if	i	look	at	that	eye	.
i	'm	not	 get 	 ting 	 	it	off	the	 eye 	 brow 	 	.
and	the	 ear 	 hole 	 	is	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	it	to	me	at	all	.
so	i	do	n't	know	how	much	 th 	 is 	 	is	 help 	 ing 	 	me	,	but	it	's	 help 	 ing 	 	to	guide	me	to	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	 signal 	 s 	 	are	coming	off	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	i	'm	not	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	,	but	to	understand	how	i	can	start	to	assemble	 thing 	 s 	 	that	will	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	bypass	 th 	 is 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	part	and	get	me	to	the	 enjoy 	 able 	 	 pre 	 cognitive 	 	 element 	 s 	 	.
anais	nin	and	the	talmud	have	told	us	time	and	time	 aga 	 in 	 	that	we	see	 thing 	 s 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	.
so	i	'm	going	to	 shame 	 lessly 	 	 ex 	 pose 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	you	,	which	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	me	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	f	1	mv	agusta	.
ahhhh	.
it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	--	i	mean	,	i	ca	n't	express	to	you	how	exquisite	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	know	why	it	's	exquisite	to	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	palimpsest	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 masse 	 s 	 	and	 masse 	 s 	 	of	 layer 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	bit	that	 protr 	 ude 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	physical	dimension	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	much	 big 	 ger 	 	.
layer	after	layer	of	legend	,	 s 	 port 	 	,	 detail 	 s 	 	that	 reson 	 ate 	 	.
i	mean	,	if	i	just	go	through	some	of	them	now	--	i	know	about	 lam 	 in 	 ar 	 	flow	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	air	-	 pierc 	 ing 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 do 	 es 	 	it	 consum 	 mate 	 ly 	 	well	,	you	can	see	it	can	.
so	that	's	 get 	 ting 	 	me	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	feel	that	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	bit	,	the	big	secret	of	 auto 	 motive 	 	design	--	 reflect 	 ion 	 	management	.
it	's	not	about	the	 shape 	 s 	 	,	it	's	how	the	 shape 	 s 	 	reflect	light	.
now	that	thing	,	light	 flick 	 ers 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	,	so	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 kine 	 tic 	 	object	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 stand 	 ing 	 	still	--	 manage 	 d 	 	by	how	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	that	's	 d 	 one 	 	on	the	 reflect 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	relief	on	the	 foot 	 plate 	 	,	by	the	way	,	to	a	rider	 mean 	 s 	 	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	going	on	 under 	 neath 	 	it	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	drive	chain	running	at	300	 mile 	 s 	 	and	hour	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	taking	the	power	from	the	engine	.
i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	my	mind	and	my	 eye 	 s 	 	flick	 a 	 cross 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 titan 	 ium 	 	lacquer	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	ca	n't	tell	you	how	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
that	's	how	you	stop	the	nuts	coming	off	at	high	speed	on	the	wheel	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	now	.
and	of	course	,	a	 rac 	 ing 	 	bike	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	prop	stand	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	road	bike	,	it	all	 go 	 es 	 	away	and	it	 fold 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	gap	.
so	it	 disappear 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	ca	n't	tell	you	how	hard	it	is	to	do	that	 radi 	 ator 	 	,	which	is	 curv 	 ed 	 	.
why	would	you	do	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	we	need	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	wheel	 far 	 ther 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 aero 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	more	expensive	,	but	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
and	to	cap	it	all	,	brand	 royal 	 ty 	 	--	agusta	,	count	agusta	,	from	the	great	 histo 	 ries 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
the	bit	that	you	ca	n't	see	is	the	 gen 	 ius 	 	that	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
massimo	tamburini	.
they	call	him	``	the	 plumb 	 er 	 	``	in	italy	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	``	 ma 	 e 	 stro 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	engineer	and	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 	and	 sculpt 	 or 	 	at	the	same	time	.
there	's	so	little	 com 	 promise 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	ca	n't	see	it	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	me	and	people	that	are	like	me	have	to	deal	with	 com 	 promise 	 	all	the	time	with	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
we	have	to	deal	with	it	.
so	i	have	to	work	with	a	supply	chain	,	and	i	've	got	to	work	with	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	and	i	've	got	to	work	with	 every 	 thing 	 	else	all	the	time	,	and	so	 com 	 promise 	 s 	 	start	to	fit	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	so	look	at	her	.
i	've	had	to	make	a	bit	of	a	 com 	 promise 	 	there	.
i	've	had	to	move	that	part	 a 	 cross 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	a	millimeter	.
no	one	's	 notice 	 d 	 	,	have	they	yet	?
did	you	see	what	i	did	?
i	 move 	 d 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	by	a	millimeter	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	?	 y 	 es 	 	.
 beaut 	 iful 	 	?	 may 	 be 	 	 less 	 er 	 	.
but	then	,	of	course	,	the	consumer	 say 	 s 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
so	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
 an 	 other 	 	millimeter	?
no	one	's	going	to	notice	 t 	 hose 	 	split	lines	and	 change 	 s 	 	.
it	's	that	easy	to	lose	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	difficult	to	do	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	people	can	do	it	.
and	a	focus	group	can	not	do	it	.
and	a	team	 rare 	 ly 	 	can	do	it	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	a	central	cortex	,	if	you	like	,	to	be	able	to	 orchestra 	 te 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 element 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	water	bottle	--	some	of	you	know	of	it	--	 d 	 one 	 	by	ross	lovegrove	,	the	 design 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	close	to	intrinsic	 beaut 	 y 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	what	water	is	like	then	you	can	experience	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 love 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	an	 embodi 	 ment 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 fresh 	 ing 	 	and	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
i	might	like	it	more	than	you	like	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	how	 blood 	 y 	 	hard	it	is	to	do	it	.
it	's	 stupefy 	 ing 	 ly 	 	difficult	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 re 	 fract 	 s 	 	light	like	that	,	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	tool	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	that	 go 	 es 	 	down	the	line	 with 	 out 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	over	.
 under 	 neath 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	like	the	story	of	the	 s 	 wan 	 	,	is	a	million	 thing 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	do	.
so	all	hail	to	that	.
it	's	a	fantastic	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	simple	object	.
and	the	one	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	was	,	of	course	,	a	 massive 	 ly 	 	complex	one	.
and	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	ways	 be 	 cause 	 	of	it	.
you	all	,	i	guess	,	like	me	,	enjoy	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	ballet	 danc 	 er 	 	dance	.
and	part	of	the	joy	of	it	is	,	you	know	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	may	be	taking	 in 	 to 	 	account	the	fact	that	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
 any 	 body 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	ballet	 danc 	 er 	 	's	 to 	 es 	 	when	they	come	out	of	the	 point 	 s 	 	?
while	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 grace 	 ful 	 	 arabesque 	 s 	 	and	plies	and	what	have	you	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	's	going	on	down	here	.
the	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	of	it	 lead 	 s 	 	us	to	a	 great 	 er 	 	and	 height 	 ened 	 	sense	of	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	on	.
now	i	'm	using	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	 wrong 	 ly 	 	here	,	so	 pleas 	 e 	 	 ignor 	 e 	 	me	.
but	what	i	have	to	do	now	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	i	've	got	to	do	is	to	be	able	to	supply	 en 	 ough 	 	of	these	 enzyme 	 s 	 	,	of	these	 trigger 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	early	on	in	the	process	,	that	you	pick	it	up	,	not	through	your	 think 	 ing 	 	,	but	through	your	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	're	going	to	have	a	little	experiment	.
right	,	are	you	ready	?	i	'm	going	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	brief	moment	.
are	you	ready	?	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
did	you	think	that	was	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	when	i	 show 	 ed 	 	it	to	you	at	the	first	flash	?
it	's	not	.
tell	me	 some 	 thing 	 	,	did	you	think	it	was	quick	when	you	first	saw	it	?	 y 	 es 	 	you	did	.
did	you	think	it	was	modern	?	 y 	 es 	 	you	did	.
that	 bli 	 p 	 	,	that	information	,	shot	 in 	 to 	 	you	before	that	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	your	brain	 start 	 er 	 	motor	 beg 	 an 	 	there	,	now	it	's	got	to	deal	with	it	.
and	the	great	thing	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	 motor 	 cycle 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 styl 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	 en 	 gender 	 	a	sense	that	it	's	green	technology	and	it	's	good	for	you	and	it	's	light	and	it	's	all	part	of	the	future	.
so	is	that	wrong	?
well	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	is	n't	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 eco 	 logically 	 	-	sound	piece	of	technology	.
but	you	're	a	slave	of	that	first	flash	.
we	are	 slave 	 s 	 	to	the	first	few	 fraction 	 s 	 	of	a	second	--	and	that	's	where	much	of	my	work	 ha 	 s 	 	to	win	or	lose	,	on	a	shelf	in	a	shop	.
it	 win 	 s 	 	or	 lose 	 s 	 	at	that	point	.
you	may	see	50	,	100	,	200	 thing 	 s 	 	on	a	shelf	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	down	it	,	but	i	have	to	work	 with 	 in 	 	that	domain	,	to	ensure	that	it	 get 	 s 	 	you	there	first	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	layer	that	i	love	,	of	knowledge	.
some	of	you	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	,	will	be	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	's	 in 	 credible 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	the	way	i	love	to	come	back	to	it	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	taking	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	hate	or	 bore 	 s 	 	you	,	 fold 	 ing 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	who	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	 any 	 body 	 	try	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
 yea 	 h 	 	?
it	's	fantastic	,	is	n't	it	?
look	at	that	.	do	you	want	to	see	it	 aga 	 in 	 	?
no	time	.	it	 say 	 s 	 	i	have	two	 minute 	 s 	 	left	,	so	we	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	just	go	to	the	web	,	youtube	,	pull	it	down	,	``	 fold 	 ing 	 	t	-	shirt	.	``
that	's	how	 under 	 paid 	 	 young 	 er 	 	-	aged	people	have	to	fold	your	t	-	shirt	.
you	did	n't	 may 	 be 	 	know	it	.
but	how	do	you	feel	about	it	?
it	 feel 	 s 	 	fantastic	when	you	do	it	,	you	look	forward	to	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	when	you	tell	 some 	 body 	 	else	about	it	--	like	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	--	you	look	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	.
the	knowledge	bubble	that	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	around	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	the	stuff	that	 cost 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	knowledge	is	free	--	 bundl 	 e 	 	that	together	and	where	do	we	come	out	?
form	 follow 	 s 	 	function	?
 on 	 ly 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.	 on 	 ly 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
form	is	function	.	form	is	function	.
it	 inform 	 s 	 	,	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	,	it	 suppli 	 es 	 	us	 answer 	 s 	 	before	we	've	even	thought	about	it	.
and	so	i	've	 stop 	 ped 	 	using	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	form	,	``	and	i	've	 stop 	 ped 	 	using	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	function	``	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
what	i	try	to	pursue	now	is	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	 functional 	 ity 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	i	can	get	that	right	,	i	can	make	them	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	and	i	can	make	them	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
and	you	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 product 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	are	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	own	some	of	them	.
they	're	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	'd	snatch	if	the	house	was	on	fire	.
 form 	 ing 	 	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	bond	between	 th 	 is 	 	thing	and	you	is	an	 electro 	 chemical 	 	party	trick	that	 happen 	 s 	 	before	you	even	think	about	it	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
