think	about	your	day	for	a	second	.
you	 wok 	 e 	 	up	,	felt	fresh	air	on	your	face	 a 	 s 	 	you	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	the	door	,	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	new	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	and	had	great	 discuss 	 ions 	 	,	and	felt	in	awe	when	you	found	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
but	i	bet	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	you	did	n't	think	about	 to 	 day 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	so	close	to	home	that	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	n't	think	about	it	 ver 	 y 	 	often	at	all	.
and	that	's	that	all	the	 sens 	 ations 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 decision 	 s 	 	and	 action 	 s 	 	are	 mediate 	 d 	 	by	the	computer	in	your	head	 call 	 ed 	 	the	brain	.
now	the	brain	may	not	look	like	much	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	--	a	couple	 pound 	 s 	 	of	 pink 	 ish 	 	-	gray	 fl 	 esh 	 	,	 a 	 morpho 	 us 	 	--	but	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 science 	 	have	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	zoom	in	on	the	brain	,	and	to	see	the	 intric 	 acy 	 	of	what	lies	 with 	 in 	 	.
and	they	've	told	us	that	 th 	 is 	 	brain	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	circuit	made	out	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
now	 un 	 like 	 	a	human	-	designed	computer	,	where	there	's	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	small	number	of	different	 part 	 s 	 	--	we	know	how	they	work	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 human 	 s 	 	designed	them	--	the	brain	is	made	out	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	.
they	come	in	different	 shape 	 s 	 	;	they	're	made	out	of	different	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
and	they	project	and	connect	to	different	brain	 region 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	change	different	ways	in	different	disease	 state 	 s 	 	.
let	's	make	it	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
there	's	a	class	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	small	cell	,	an	 inhibit 	 ory 	 	cell	,	that	 quiet 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
it	's	one	of	the	 cell 	 s 	 	that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 atro 	 phi 	 ed 	 	in	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	like	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	basket	cell	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	cell	is	one	of	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 kind 	 s 	 	of	cell	that	we	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	.
new	 one 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	 every 	 day 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	just	a	second	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	these	 pyramid 	 al 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	large	 cell 	 s 	 	,	they	can	span	a	significant	fraction	of	the	brain	.
they	're	 excit 	 atory 	 	.
and	these	are	some	of	the	 cell 	 s 	 	that	might	be	 over 	 active 	 	in	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	epilepsy	.
every	one	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
they	 receiv 	 e 	 	 in 	 put 	 	from	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 up 	 stream 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	and	compute	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 electric 	 al 	 	 out 	 put 	 s 	 	,	which	then	,	if	they	pass	a	certain	threshold	,	will	go	to	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 down 	 stream 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	which	 take 	 s 	 	just	a	 milli 	 second 	 	or	so	,	 happen 	 s 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	a	minute	in	every	one	of	your	100	billion	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	live	and	think	and	feel	.
so	how	are	we	going	to	figure	out	what	 th 	 is 	 	circuit	 do 	 es 	 	?
 ideal 	 ly 	 	,	we	could	go	through	the	circuit	and	turn	these	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	cell	on	and	off	and	see	 whet 	 her 	 	we	could	figure	out	which	 one 	 s 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	certain	 function 	 s 	 	and	which	 one 	 s 	 	go	wrong	in	certain	 patho 	 logies 	 	.
if	we	could	activate	 cell 	 s 	 	,	we	could	see	what	 power 	 s 	 	they	can	unleash	,	what	they	can	 initi 	 ate 	 	and	sustain	.
if	we	could	turn	them	off	,	then	we	could	try	and	figure	out	what	they	're	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	.
and	that	's	a	story	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	where	we	've	gone	through	over	the	last	11	 year 	 s 	 	,	through	an	attempt	to	find	ways	of	 turn 	 ing 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	and	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 part 	 s 	 	and	 path 	 ways 	 	of	the	brain	on	and	off	,	both	to	understand	the	science	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	confront	some	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	face	us	all	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	.
now	before	i	tell	you	about	the	technology	,	the	bad	news	is	that	a	significant	fraction	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	if	we	live	long	 en 	 ough 	 	,	will	 en 	 counter 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	a	brain	 dis 	 order 	 	.
 al 	 ready 	 	,	a	billion	people	have	had	some	kind	of	brain	 dis 	 order 	 	that	 incapacit 	 ates 	 	them	,	and	the	 number 	 s 	 	do	n't	do	it	justice	 th 	 ough 	 	.
these	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	--	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	,	alzheimer	's	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	 addict 	 ion 	 	--	they	not	 on 	 ly 	 	steal	our	time	to	live	,	they	change	who	we	are	.
they	take	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	change	our	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	change	who	we	are	 a 	 s 	 	people	.
now	in	the	20th	century	,	there	was	some	hope	that	was	generated	through	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	for	 treat 	 ing 	 	brain	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	,	and	while	 man 	 y 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	that	can	 allevi 	 ate 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	brain	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	,	 practical 	 ly 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	can	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	to	be	 cur 	 ed 	 	.
and	part	of	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 bath 	 ing 	 	the	brain	in	the	chemical	.
 th 	 is 	 	elaborate	circuit	made	out	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	cell	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 bath 	 ed 	 	in	a	 sub 	 stance 	 	.
that	's	 al 	 so 	 	why	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	most	of	the	 drug 	 s 	 	,	and	not	all	,	on	the	market	can	present	some	kind	of	serious	side	effect	too	.
now	some	people	have	gotten	some	 so 	 lace 	 	from	 electric 	 al 	 	 stimul 	 ators 	 	that	are	 implant 	 ed 	 	in	the	brain	.
and	for	parkinson	's	disease	,	 cochlea 	 r 	 	 implant 	 s 	 	,	these	have	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 br 	 ing 	 	some	kind	of	 re 	 med 	 y 	 	to	people	with	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 dis 	 order 	 	.
but	 electric 	 ity 	 	 al 	 so 	 	will	go	in	all	 direction 	 s 	 	--	the	path	of	 l 	 east 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	,	which	is	where	that	phrase	,	in	part	,	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	will	affect	normal	 circuit 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 ab 	 normal 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	you	want	to	fix	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	're	 s 	 ent 	 	back	to	the	idea	of	ultra	-	precise	control	.
could	we	dial	-	in	information	 precise 	 ly 	 	where	we	want	it	to	go	?
so	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	 neuro 	 science 	 	11	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	had	trained	 a 	 s 	 	an	 electric 	 al 	 	engineer	and	a	physicist	,	and	the	first	thing	i	thought	about	was	,	if	these	 neuro 	 ns 	 	are	 electric 	 al 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	all	we	need	to	do	is	to	find	some	way	of	 driv 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 change 	 s 	 	at	a	distance	.
if	we	could	turn	on	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	one	cell	,	but	not	 it 	 s 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	that	would	give	us	the	tool	we	need	to	activate	and	shut	down	these	different	 cell 	 s 	 	,	figure	out	what	they	do	and	how	they	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	the	 network 	 s 	 	in	which	they	're	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	it	would	allow	us	to	have	the	ultra	-	precise	control	we	need	in	order	to	fix	the	circuit	 computation 	 s 	 	that	have	gone	 a 	 wry 	 	.
now	how	are	we	going	to	do	that	?
well	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	exist	in	nature	,	which	are	able	to	convert	light	 in 	 to 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
you	can	think	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	little	 protein 	 s 	 	that	are	like	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	.
if	we	can	install	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	 neuro 	 ns 	 	 some 	 how 	 	,	then	these	 neuro 	 ns 	 	would	 be 	 come 	 	 electric 	 ally 	 	 driv 	 able 	 	with	light	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	which	do	n't	have	the	molecule	,	would	not	.
there	's	one	other	magic	trick	you	need	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	all	happen	,	and	that	's	the	ability	to	get	light	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	.
and	to	do	that	--	the	brain	 do 	 es 	 	n't	feel	pain	--	you	can	put	--	taking	advantage	of	all	the	effort	that	's	gone	 in 	 to 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	 communication 	 s 	 	and	so	on	--	optical	 fiber 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 laser 	 s 	 	that	you	can	use	to	activate	,	in	animal	 model 	 s 	 	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	pre	-	 clinic 	 al 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	these	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	to	see	what	they	do	.
so	how	do	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
around	2004	,	in	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	gerhard	nagel	and	karl	deisseroth	,	 th 	 is 	 	vision	came	to	 fruit 	 ion 	 	.
there	's	a	certain	 al 	 ga 	 	that	 swim 	 s 	 	in	the	wild	,	and	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	 navig 	 ate 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	light	in	order	to	 photo 	 synthesize 	 	 optimal 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	 sense 	 s 	 	light	with	a	little	eye	-	spot	,	which	 work 	 s 	 	not	 un 	 like 	 	how	our	eye	 work 	 s 	 	.
in	 it 	 s 	 	membrane	,	or	 it 	 s 	 	 bound 	 ary 	 	,	it	 contain 	 s 	 	little	 protein 	 s 	 	that	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	can	convert	light	 in 	 to 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
so	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 channel 	 rhodopsin 	 s 	 	.
and	each	of	these	 protein 	 s 	 	 act 	 s 	 	just	like	that	solar	cell	that	i	told	you	about	.
when	blue	light	 hit 	 s 	 	it	,	it	 open 	 s 	 	up	a	little	hole	and	 allow 	 s 	 	charged	 particle 	 s 	 	to	enter	the	eye	-	spot	,	and	that	 allow 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	eye	-	spot	to	have	an	 electric 	 al 	 	signal	just	like	a	solar	cell	charging	up	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
so	what	we	need	to	do	is	to	take	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	 some 	 how 	 	install	them	in	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	protein	,	it	's	 encode 	 d 	 	for	in	the	dna	of	 th 	 is 	 	organism	.
so	all	we	've	got	to	do	is	take	that	dna	,	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	gene	therapy	vector	,	like	a	virus	,	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
so	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	productive	time	in	gene	therapy	,	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	viruses	 we 	 re 	 	coming	 a 	 long 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	to	do	.
and	early	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	one	day	in	the	summer	of	2004	,	we	 g 	 ave 	 	it	a	try	,	and	it	 work 	 ed 	 	on	the	first	try	.
you	take	 th 	 is 	 	dna	and	you	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 neuro 	 n 	 	.
the	 neuro 	 n 	 	uses	 it 	 s 	 	natural	protein	-	making	 machine 	 ry 	 	to	 fabric 	 ate 	 	these	little	light	-	sensitive	 protein 	 s 	 	and	install	them	all	over	the	cell	,	like	 put 	 ting 	 	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	on	a	roof	,	and	the	next	thing	you	know	,	you	have	a	 neuro 	 n 	 	which	can	be	 activate 	 d 	 	with	light	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
one	of	the	 trick 	 s 	 	you	have	to	do	is	to	figure	out	how	to	deliver	these	 gene 	 s 	 	to	the	 cell 	 s 	 	that	you	want	and	not	all	the	other	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	do	that	;	you	can	tweak	the	viruses	so	they	hit	just	some	 cell 	 s 	 	and	not	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	other	genetic	 trick 	 s 	 	you	can	play	in	order	to	get	light	-	 activate 	 d 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	field	 ha 	 s 	 	now	come	to	be	known	 a 	 s 	 	 op 	 to 	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
and	just	 a 	 s 	 	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	kind	of	thing	you	can	do	,	you	can	take	a	complex	network	,	use	one	of	these	viruses	to	deliver	the	gene	just	to	one	kind	of	cell	in	 th 	 is 	 	dense	network	.
and	then	when	you	shine	light	on	the	entire	network	,	just	that	cell	type	will	be	 activate 	 d 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	lets	sort	of	consider	that	basket	cell	i	told	you	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	--	the	one	that	's	 atro 	 phi 	 ed 	 	in	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	and	the	one	that	is	 inhibit 	 ory 	 	.
if	we	can	deliver	that	gene	to	these	 cell 	 s 	 	--	and	they	're	not	going	to	be	 alter 	 ed 	 	by	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	the	gene	,	of	course	--	and	then	flash	blue	light	over	the	entire	brain	network	,	just	these	 cell 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	driven	.
and	when	the	light	 turn 	 s 	 	off	,	these	 cell 	 s 	 	go	back	to	normal	,	so	they	do	n't	seem	to	be	 a 	 verse 	 	against	that	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	you	use	 th 	 is 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	what	these	 cell 	 s 	 	do	,	what	 the 	 ir 	 	power	is	in	computing	in	the	brain	,	but	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	use	 th 	 is 	 	to	try	to	figure	out	--	well	 may 	 be 	 	we	could	jazz	up	the	activity	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	,	if	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	they	're	 atro 	 phi 	 ed 	 	.
now	i	want	to	tell	you	a	couple	of	short	 st 	 ories 	 	about	how	we	're	using	 th 	 is 	 	,	both	at	the	scientific	,	 clinic 	 al 	 	and	pre	-	 clinic 	 al 	 	 level 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	we	've	 confront 	 ed 	 	is	,	what	are	the	 signal 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	that	mediate	the	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	reward	?
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	could	find	 t 	 hose 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	would	be	some	of	the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	could	drive	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
the	brain	will	do	more	of	 what 	 ever 	 	got	that	reward	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	these	are	 signal 	 s 	 	that	go	 a 	 wry 	 	in	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 addict 	 ion 	 	.
so	if	we	could	figure	out	what	 cell 	 s 	 	they	are	,	we	could	 may 	 be 	 	find	new	 target 	 s 	 	for	which	 drug 	 s 	 	could	be	designed	or	 screen 	 ed 	 	against	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	could	be	put	in	for	people	who	have	 ver 	 y 	 	severe	 dis 	 ability 	 	.
so	to	do	that	,	we	came	up	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	paradigm	in	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	the	fiorella	group	,	where	one	side	of	 th 	 is 	 	little	box	,	if	the	animal	 go 	 es 	 	there	,	the	animal	 get 	 s 	 	a	 puls 	 e 	 	of	light	in	order	to	make	different	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	sensitive	to	light	.
so	if	these	 cell 	 s 	 	can	mediate	reward	,	the	animal	should	go	there	more	and	more	.
and	so	that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	animal	's	going	to	go	to	the	right	-	hand	side	and	poke	his	nose	there	,	and	he	 get 	 s 	 	a	flash	of	blue	light	every	time	he	 do 	 es 	 	that	.
and	he	'll	do	that	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	dopamine	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	which	some	of	you	may	have	heard	about	,	in	some	of	the	pleasure	 center 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
now	we	've	 show 	 n 	 	that	a	brief	 activ 	 ation 	 	of	these	is	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	to	drive	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
now	we	can	 general 	 ize 	 	the	idea	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	one	point	in	the	brain	,	we	can	 dev 	 ise 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	span	the	brain	,	that	can	deliver	light	 in 	 to 	 	three	-	dimensional	 pattern 	 s 	 	--	 array 	 s 	 	of	optical	 fiber 	 s 	 	,	each	 couple 	 d 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	own	 in 	 dependent 	 	 miniatur 	 e 	 	light	source	.
and	then	we	can	try	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 viv 	 o 	 	that	have	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	-	date	in	a	dish	--	like	high	-	 through 	 put 	 	 screen 	 ing 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	entire	brain	for	the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	can	cause	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	to	happen	.
or	that	could	be	good	 clinic 	 al 	 	 target 	 s 	 	for	 treat 	 ing 	 	brain	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
and	one	story	i	want	to	tell	you	about	is	how	can	we	find	 target 	 s 	 	for	 treat 	 ing 	 	post	-	 trauma 	 tic 	 	stress	 dis 	 order 	 	--	a	form	of	 un 	 controlled 	 	 anxie 	 ty 	 	and	fear	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	did	was	to	adopt	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 classic 	 al 	 	model	of	fear	.
 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	the	pavlovian	 day 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	pavlovian	fear	 condition 	 ing 	 	--	where	a	tone	 end 	 s 	 	with	a	brief	shock	.
the	shock	is	n't	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	but	it	's	a	little	 annoy 	 ing 	 	.
and	over	time	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	mouse	,	which	is	a	good	animal	model	,	 common 	 ly 	 	used	in	 s 	 uch 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	--	the	animal	 learn 	 s 	 	to	fear	the	tone	.
the	animal	will	react	by	freezing	,	sort	of	like	a	 de 	 er 	 	in	the	 head 	 light 	 s 	 	.
now	the	question	is	,	what	 target 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	can	we	find	that	allow	us	to	 over 	 come 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fear	?
so	what	we	do	is	we	play	that	tone	 aga 	 in 	 	after	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	fear	.
but	we	activate	 target 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	,	different	 one 	 s 	 	,	using	that	optical	fiber	array	i	told	you	about	in	the	previous	slide	,	in	order	to	try	and	figure	out	which	 target 	 s 	 	can	cause	the	brain	to	 over 	 come 	 	that	 memor 	 y 	 	of	fear	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	brief	video	 show 	 s 	 	you	one	of	these	 target 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	area	in	the	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	,	a	region	where	we	can	use	cognition	to	try	to	 over 	 come 	 	aversive	 emotion 	 al 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	the	animal	's	going	to	hear	a	tone	--	and	a	flash	of	light	 occur 	 red 	 	there	.
there	's	no	audio	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	you	can	see	the	animal	's	freezing	.
 th 	 is 	 	tone	used	to	mean	bad	news	.
and	there	's	a	little	clock	in	the	lower	left	-	hand	corner	,	so	you	can	see	the	animal	is	about	two	 minute 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	now	 th 	 is 	 	next	clip	is	just	eight	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	the	same	tone	is	going	to	play	,	and	the	light	is	going	to	flash	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	there	it	 go 	 es 	 	.	right	now	.
and	now	you	can	see	,	just	10	 minute 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	experiment	,	that	we	've	 equi 	 pped 	 	the	brain	by	 photo 	 activ 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	area	to	 over 	 come 	 	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	fear	 memor 	 y 	 	.
now	over	the	last	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	gone	back	to	the	tree	of	life	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	ways	to	turn	 circuit 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	off	.
if	we	could	do	that	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
if	you	can	delete	 cell 	 s 	 	just	for	a	few	 milli 	 second 	 s 	 	or	 second 	 s 	 	,	you	can	figure	out	what	 necess 	 ary 	 	role	they	play	in	the	 circuit 	 s 	 	in	which	they	're	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	've	now	 survey 	 ed 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	from	all	over	the	tree	of	life	--	every	 king 	 dom 	 	of	life	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 animal 	 s 	 	,	we	see	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
and	we	found	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	 halo 	 rhodopsin 	 s 	 	or	 arch 	 a 	 e 	 rhodopsin 	 s 	 	,	that	respond	to	green	and	yellow	light	.
and	they	do	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	thing	of	the	molecule	i	told	you	about	before	with	the	blue	light	 activ 	 ator 	 	 channel 	 rhodopsin 	 	.
let	's	give	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	where	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	go	.
consider	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	condition	like	epilepsy	,	where	the	brain	is	 over 	 active 	 	.
now	if	 drug 	 s 	 	fail	in	epileptic	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	one	of	the	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	is	to	 re 	 move 	 	part	of	the	brain	.
but	that	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 ir 	 revers 	 ible 	 	,	and	there	could	be	side	 effect 	 s 	 	.
what	if	we	could	just	turn	off	that	brain	for	a	brief	amount	of	time	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	seizure	dies	away	,	and	cause	the	brain	to	be	 resto 	 red 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	 initi 	 al 	 	state	--	sort	of	like	a	 dynamic 	 al 	 	system	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 coax 	 ed 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	a	 s 	 table 	 	state	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	just	tries	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	where	we	made	these	 cell 	 s 	 	sensitive	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	off	with	light	,	and	we	beam	light	in	,	and	just	for	the	time	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	shut	down	a	seizure	,	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	be	able	to	turn	it	off	.
and	so	we	do	n't	have	data	to	show	you	on	 th 	 is 	 	front	,	but	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	i	want	to	close	on	one	story	,	which	we	think	is	 an 	 other 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	--	which	is	that	 may 	 be 	 	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	if	you	can	do	ultra	-	precise	control	,	can	be	used	in	the	brain	 it 	 self 	 	to	make	a	new	kind	of	 prost 	 hetic 	 	,	an	optical	 prost 	 hetic 	 	.
i	 al 	 ready 	 	told	you	that	 electric 	 al 	 	 stimul 	 ators 	 	are	not	 un 	 common 	 	.
seventy	-	five	thousand	people	have	parkinson	's	deep	-	brain	 stimul 	 ators 	 	 implant 	 ed 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	100,000	people	have	 cochlea 	 r 	 	 implant 	 s 	 	,	which	allow	them	to	hear	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	,	which	is	you	've	got	to	get	these	 gene 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	new	hope	in	gene	therapy	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	viruses	like	the	adeno	-	 associate 	 d 	 	virus	,	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	most	of	us	around	 th 	 is 	 	room	have	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	which	have	 be 	 en 	 	used	in	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	to	deliver	 gene 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	or	the	body	.
and	so	far	,	there	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	serious	 advers 	 e 	 	 event 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	the	virus	.
there	's	one	last	elephant	in	the	room	,	the	 protein 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	which	come	from	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	and	bacteria	and	fungi	,	and	all	over	the	tree	of	life	.
most	of	us	do	n't	have	fungi	or	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	,	so	what	is	our	brain	going	to	do	if	we	put	that	in	?
are	the	 cell 	 s 	 	going	to	 toler 	 ate 	 	it	?	will	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	react	?
in	 it 	 s 	 	early	 day 	 s 	 	--	these	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	on	 human 	 s 	 	yet	--	but	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	to	try	and	examine	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	so	far	we	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	 over 	 t 	 	 react 	 ions 	 	of	any	 s 	 ever 	 ity 	 	to	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	or	to	the	 illumi 	 nation 	 	of	the	brain	with	light	.
so	it	's	early	 day 	 s 	 	,	to	be	 up 	 front 	 	,	but	we	're	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	it	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	close	with	one	story	,	which	we	think	could	 potential 	 ly 	 	be	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	application	.
now	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 blind 	 ness 	 	where	the	 photo 	 receptor 	 s 	 	,	our	light	 sensor 	 s 	 	that	are	in	the	back	of	our	eye	,	are	gone	.
and	the	retina	,	of	course	,	is	a	complex	structure	.
now	let	's	zoom	in	on	it	here	,	so	we	can	see	it	in	more	detail	.
the	 photo 	 receptor 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 show 	 n 	 	here	at	the	top	,	and	then	the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	are	 detect 	 ed 	 	by	the	 photo 	 receptor 	 s 	 	are	 transform 	 ed 	 	by	 vari 	 ous 	 	 computation 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	that	layer	of	 cell 	 s 	 	at	the	bottom	,	the	 gang 	 lion 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 lay 	 	the	information	to	the	brain	,	where	we	see	that	 a 	 s 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 blind 	 ness 	 	,	like	 ret 	 initi 	 s 	 	 pigment 	 osa 	 	,	or	 ma 	 cular 	 	 de 	 generation 	 	,	the	 photo 	 receptor 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	have	 atro 	 phi 	 ed 	 	or	 be 	 en 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	.
now	how	could	you	repair	 th 	 is 	 	?
it	's	not	even	clear	that	a	drug	could	cause	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	 resto 	 red 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	the	drug	to	bind	to	.
on	the	other	hand	,	light	can	still	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	eye	.
the	eye	is	still	 trans 	 parent 	 	and	you	can	get	light	in	.
so	what	if	we	could	just	take	these	 channel 	 rhodopsin 	 s 	 	and	other	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	install	them	on	some	of	these	other	spare	 cell 	 s 	 	and	convert	them	 in 	 to 	 	little	 camera 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	eye	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	,	they	could	be	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	some	work	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	led	by	one	of	our	 collabor 	 ators 	 	,	alan	horsager	at	usc	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ought 	 	to	be	 commercial 	 ized 	 	by	a	start	-	up	company	eos	 neuro 	 science 	 	,	which	is	funded	by	the	nih	.
and	what	you	see	here	is	a	mouse	 try 	 ing 	 	to	solve	a	maze	.
it	's	a	six	-	arm	maze	.	and	there	's	a	bit	of	water	in	the	maze	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	the	mouse	to	move	,	or	he	'll	just	 s 	 it 	 	there	.
and	the	goal	,	of	course	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	maze	is	to	get	out	of	the	water	and	go	to	a	little	platform	that	's	under	the	lit	top	port	.
now	 mic 	 e 	 	are	smart	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	mouse	 solve 	 s 	 	the	maze	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	but	he	 do 	 es 	 	a	brute	-	force	search	.
he	's	 swimm 	 ing 	 	down	every	 a 	 venue 	 	 un 	 til 	 	he	 final 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	to	the	platform	.
so	he	's	not	using	vision	to	do	it	.
these	different	 mic 	 e 	 	are	different	 mutation 	 s 	 	that	recapitulate	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 blind 	 ness 	 	that	affect	 human 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	these	different	 model 	 s 	 	so	we	come	up	with	a	 general 	 ized 	 	approach	.
so	how	are	we	going	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	?
we	're	going	to	do	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	 out 	 lined 	 	in	the	previous	slide	.
we	're	going	to	take	these	blue	light	 photo 	 sensor 	 s 	 	and	install	them	on	a	layer	of	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	retina	in	the	back	of	the	eye	and	convert	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	camera	--	just	like	 install 	 ing 	 	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	all	over	 t 	 hose 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	to	make	them	light	sensitive	.
light	is	 convert 	 ed 	 	to	 electric 	 ity 	 	on	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	mouse	was	blind	a	couple	 week 	 s 	 	before	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	and	 receiv 	 ed 	 	one	dose	of	 th 	 is 	 	 photo 	 sensitive 	 	molecule	in	a	virus	.
and	now	you	can	see	,	the	animal	can	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	avoid	 wall 	 s 	 	and	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	little	platform	and	make	cognitive	use	of	 it 	 s 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	to	point	out	the	power	of	 th 	 is 	 	:	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	able	to	get	to	that	platform	just	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	that	have	 s 	 een 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	pre	-	 clinic 	 al 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	i	think	,	 bod 	 es 	 	hope	for	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	do	in	the	future	.
to	close	,	i	want	to	point	out	that	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	new	business	 model 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	new	field	of	 neuro 	 technology 	 	.
we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	these	 tool 	 s 	 	,	but	we	share	them	 free 	 ly 	 	with	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 group 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	,	so	people	can	 stud 	 y 	 	and	try	to	treat	different	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
and	our	hope	is	that	,	by	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	brain	 circuit 	 s 	 	at	a	level	of	 abstract 	 ion 	 	that	lets	us	repair	them	and	engineer	them	,	we	can	take	some	of	these	intractable	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	that	i	told	you	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	 practical 	 ly 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	which	are	 cur 	 ed 	 	,	and	in	the	21st	century	make	them	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
thank	you	.
juan	enriquez	:	so	some	of	the	stuff	is	a	little	dense	.
but	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	control	 seizure 	 s 	 	or	epilepsy	with	light	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 drug 	 s 	 	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	target	 t 	 hose 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	is	a	first	step	.
the	second	thing	that	i	think	i	heard	you	say	is	you	can	now	control	the	brain	in	two	 color 	 s 	 	,	like	an	on	/	off	 s 	 witch 	 	.
ed	boyden	:	that	's	right	.
je	:	which	 make 	 s 	 	every	impulse	going	through	the	brain	a	 bin 	 ary 	 	code	.
eb	:	right	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
so	with	blue	light	,	we	can	drive	information	,	and	it	's	in	the	form	of	a	one	.
and	by	 turn 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	off	,	it	's	more	or	less	a	zero	.
so	our	hope	is	to	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	build	brain	 co 	 processor 	 s 	 	that	work	with	the	brain	so	we	can	augment	 function 	 s 	 	in	people	with	 dis 	 abilities 	 	.
je	:	and	in	 theor 	 y 	 	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	mouse	 feel 	 s 	 	,	 smell 	 s 	 	,	 hear 	 s 	 	,	 touch 	 es 	 	,	you	can	model	it	out	 a 	 s 	 	a	string	of	 one 	 s 	 	and	 zero 	 s 	 	.
eb	:	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 test 	 ing 	 	what	neural	 code 	 s 	 	can	drive	certain	 behavior 	 s 	 	and	certain	 thought 	 s 	 	and	certain	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	use	that	to	understand	more	about	the	brain	.
je	:	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	that	some	day	you	could	download	 memor 	 ies 	 	and	 may 	 be 	 	upload	them	?
eb	:	well	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	work	on	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
we	're	now	 work 	 ing 	 	on	some	work	where	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tile	the	brain	with	 record 	 ing 	 	 element 	 s 	 	too	.
so	we	can	record	information	and	then	drive	information	back	in	--	sort	of	computing	what	the	brain	 need 	 s 	 	in	order	to	augment	 it 	 s 	 	information	 process 	 ing 	 	.
je	:	well	,	that	might	change	a	couple	 thing 	 s 	 	.	thank	you	.
