i	'm	here	to	spread	the	word	about	the	 magnific 	 ence 	 	of	 spider 	 s 	 	and	how	much	we	can	learn	from	them	.
 spider 	 s 	 	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
you	can	find	 spider 	 s 	 	in	 near 	 ly 	 	every	terrestrial	 habit 	 at 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	red	dot	 mark 	 s 	 	the	great	basin	of	north	america	,	and	i	'm	 involve 	 d 	 	with	an	 al 	 pine 	 	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	project	there	with	some	 collabor 	 ators 	 	.
here	's	one	of	our	field	 s 	 ites 	 	,	and	just	to	give	you	a	sense	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	little	blue	 smudg 	 e 	 	here	,	that	's	one	of	my	 collabor 	 ators 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 rug 	 ged 	 	and	 bar 	 ren 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	yet	there	are	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	 spider 	 s 	 	here	.
 turn 	 ing 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	over	 reveal 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	crab	spider	 grappl 	 ing 	 	with	a	beetle	.
 spider 	 s 	 	are	not	just	 every 	 where 	 	,	but	they	're	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	.
there	are	over	40,000	 de 	 scribed 	 	species	of	 spider 	 s 	 	.
to	put	that	number	 in 	 to 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	here	's	a	graph	 compar 	 ing 	 	the	40,000	species	of	 spider 	 s 	 	to	the	400	species	of	 prim 	 ates 	 	.
there	are	two	 order 	 s 	 	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	more	 spider 	 s 	 	than	 prim 	 ates 	 	.
 spider 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	old	.
on	the	bottom	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 geo 	 logic 	 	 time 	 scale 	 	,	and	the	 number 	 s 	 	on	it	 indic 	 ate 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	from	the	present	,	so	the	zero	here	,	that	would	be	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	what	 th 	 is 	 	figure	 show 	 s 	 	is	that	 spider 	 s 	 	date	back	to	 al 	 most 	 	380	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
to	put	that	 in 	 to 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	red	 vert 	 ical 	 	bar	here	 mark 	 s 	 	the	 diverge 	 nce 	 	time	of	 human 	 s 	 	from	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	a	mere	seven	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
all	 spider 	 s 	 	make	silk	at	some	point	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
most	 spider 	 s 	 	use	 cop 	 ious 	 	 amount 	 s 	 	of	silk	,	and	silk	is	essential	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 surviv 	 al 	 	and	 re 	 production 	 	.
even	fossil	 spider 	 s 	 	can	make	silk	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	see	from	 th 	 is 	 	impression	of	a	spinneret	on	 th 	 is 	 	fossil	spider	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	both	 spider 	 s 	 	and	spider	silk	have	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	380	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	long	from	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 spider 	 s 	 	to	start	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	how	essential	silk	is	to	just	about	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
 spider 	 s 	 	use	silk	for	 man 	 y 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 trail 	 ing 	 	 safe 	 ty 	 	 drag 	 line 	 	,	 wrap 	 ping 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	for	 re 	 production 	 	,	 protect 	 ive 	 	 re 	 treat 	 s 	 	and	 catch 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	spider	silk	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	garden	spider	can	make	seven	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 silk 	 s 	 	.
when	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	orb	web	,	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 type 	 s 	 	of	silk	 fiber 	 s 	 	.
the	frame	and	 radi 	 i 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	web	is	made	up	of	one	type	of	silk	,	while	the	capture	spiral	is	a	composite	of	two	different	 silk 	 s 	 	:	the	 fi 	 lament 	 	and	the	 stick 	 y 	 	 drop 	 let 	 	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	an	individual	spider	make	so	 man 	 y 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	silk	?
to	answer	that	,	you	have	to	look	a	lot	 close 	 r 	 	at	the	spinneret	region	of	a	spider	.
so	silk	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 spinneret 	 s 	 	,	and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	spider	silk	 biologist 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	call	the	``	business	end	``	of	the	spider	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	long	 day 	 s 	 	...
 he 	 y 	 	!	do	n't	laugh	.	that	's	my	life	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	long	 day 	 s 	 	and	 night 	 s 	 	 star 	 ing 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	spider	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	see	.
you	can	see	 multi 	 ple 	 	 fiber 	 s 	 	coming	out	of	the	 spinneret 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	each	spinneret	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 spigot 	 s 	 	on	it	.
each	of	these	silk	 fiber 	 s 	 	 exit 	 s 	 	from	the	spigot	,	and	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	trace	the	fiber	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	spider	,	what	you	would	find	is	that	each	spigot	 connect 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	own	individual	silk	 g 	 land 	 	.	a	silk	 g 	 land 	 	kind	of	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	sac	with	a	lot	of	silk	 protein 	 s 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
so	if	you	ever	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	dissect	an	orb	-	web	-	weaving	spider	,	and	i	hope	you	do	,	what	you	would	find	is	a	bounty	of	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 trans 	 lu 	 cent 	 	silk	 g 	 land 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 side 	 	each	spider	,	there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	silk	 g 	 land 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	.
these	can	be	 group 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	seven	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
they	differ	by	 s 	 ize 	 	,	shape	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	color	.
in	an	orb	-	web	-	weaving	spider	,	you	can	find	seven	 type 	 s 	 	of	silk	 g 	 land 	 s 	 	,	and	what	i	have	 depict 	 ed 	 	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	let	's	start	at	the	one	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	position	,	there	's	 tub 	 uli 	 form 	 	silk	 g 	 land 	 s 	 	,	which	are	used	to	make	the	 out 	 er 	 	silk	of	an	egg	sac	.
there	's	the	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	and	 flag 	 elli 	 form 	 	silk	 g 	 land 	 s 	 	which	combine	to	make	the	 stick 	 y 	 	capture	spiral	of	an	orb	web	.
pyriform	silk	 g 	 land 	 s 	 	make	the	 attach 	 ment 	 	cement	--	that	's	the	silk	that	's	used	to	adhere	silk	lines	to	a	substrate	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	 ac 	 ini 	 form 	 	silk	,	which	is	used	to	wrap	 pre 	 y 	 	.
minor	 am 	 pull 	 ate 	 	silk	is	used	in	web	construction	.
and	the	most	 stud 	 ied 	 	silk	line	of	them	all	:	major	 am 	 pull 	 ate 	 	silk	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	silk	that	's	used	to	make	the	frame	and	 radi 	 i 	 	of	an	orb	web	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 safe 	 ty 	 	 trail 	 ing 	 	 drag 	 line 	 	.
but	what	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	,	is	spider	silk	?
spider	silk	is	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	protein	.
 near 	 ly 	 	all	of	these	 protein 	 s 	 	can	be	 explain 	 ed 	 	by	a	single	gene	family	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	silk	 type 	 s 	 	we	see	 to 	 day 	 	is	 encode 	 d 	 	by	one	gene	family	,	so	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	the	original	spider	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	made	one	kind	of	silk	,	and	over	the	last	380	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	one	silk	gene	 ha 	 s 	 	 duplic 	 ated 	 	and	then	 diverge 	 d 	 	,	 special 	 ized 	 	,	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	to	get	the	large	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 flavor 	 s 	 	of	spider	 silk 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	.
there	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	that	all	these	 silk 	 s 	 	have	in	common	.	they	all	have	a	common	design	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	long	--	they	're	sort	of	 outlandish 	 ly 	 	long	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	other	 protein 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 repetit 	 ive 	 	,	and	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	in	the	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	glycine	and	alanine	.
to	give	you	an	idea	of	what	a	spider	silk	protein	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 drag 	 line 	 	silk	protein	,	it	's	just	a	 port 	 ion 	 	of	it	,	from	the	black	widow	spider	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	sequence	that	i	love	looking	at	day	and	night	.
so	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	the	one	letter	 abbrevi 	 ation 	 	for	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	 color 	 ed 	 	in	the	 glycine 	 s 	 	with	green	,	and	the	 alanine 	 s 	 	in	red	,	and	so	you	can	see	it	's	just	a	lot	of	g	's	and	a	's	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	that	there	's	a	lot	of	short	sequence	 motif 	 s 	 	that	repeat	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	what	we	call	 poly 	 alanine 	 s 	 	,	or	 ite 	 rated 	 	a	's	,	aaaaa	.	there	's	ggq	.	there	's	ggy	.
you	can	think	of	these	short	 motif 	 s 	 	that	repeat	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	these	 word 	 s 	 	occur	in	 sentence 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	one	sentence	,	and	you	would	get	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	green	region	and	the	red	 poly 	 alanine 	 	,	that	 repeat 	 s 	 	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	you	can	have	that	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	an	individual	silk	molecule	.
 silk 	 s 	 	made	by	the	same	spider	can	have	 dramat 	 ically 	 	different	repeat	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
at	the	top	of	the	screen	,	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	repeat	unit	from	the	 drag 	 line 	 	silk	of	a	garden	argiope	spider	.
it	's	short	.	and	on	the	bottom	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	repeat	sequence	for	the	egg	case	,	or	 tub 	 uli 	 form 	 	silk	protein	,	for	the	exact	same	spider	.	and	you	can	see	how	 dramat 	 ically 	 	different	these	silk	 protein 	 s 	 	are	--	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	the	 divers 	 ification 	 	of	the	spider	silk	gene	family	.
you	can	see	that	the	repeat	 unit 	 s 	 	differ	in	length	.	they	 al 	 so 	 	differ	in	sequence	.
so	i	've	 color 	 ed 	 	in	the	 glycine 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	green	,	alanine	in	red	,	and	the	 s 	 er 	 ine 	 s 	 	,	the	letter	s	,	in	 pur 	 ple 	 	.	and	you	can	see	that	the	top	repeat	unit	can	be	 explain 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	by	green	and	red	,	and	the	bottom	repeat	unit	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 	amount	of	 pur 	 ple 	 	.
what	silk	 biologist 	 s 	 	do	is	we	try	to	 re 	 late 	 	these	 sequence 	 s 	 	,	these	 am 	 ino 	 	acid	 sequence 	 s 	 	,	to	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	the	silk	 fiber 	 s 	 	.
now	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	convenient	that	 spider 	 s 	 	use	 the 	 ir 	 	silk	 complete 	 ly 	 	 out 	 side 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	body	.
 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	spider	silk	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	to	do	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	,	 test 	 ing 	 	it	in	air	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	environment	that	 spider 	 s 	 	are	using	 the 	 ir 	 	silk	 protein 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	 quant 	 ifying 	 	silk	 proper 	 ties 	 	by	 method 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 ten 	 s 	 ile 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	you	know	,	 tugg 	 ing 	 	on	one	end	of	the	fiber	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 a 	 men 	 able 	 	.
here	are	stress	-	 s 	 train 	 	 curv 	 es 	 	generated	by	 ten 	 s 	 ile 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	five	 fiber 	 s 	 	made	by	the	same	spider	.
so	what	you	can	see	here	is	that	the	five	 fiber 	 s 	 	have	different	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
 specific 	 ally 	 	,	if	you	look	on	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	axis	,	that	's	stress	.	if	you	look	at	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	stress	value	for	each	of	these	 fiber 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	that	there	's	a	lot	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	and	in	fact	 drag 	 line 	 	,	or	major	 am 	 pull 	 ate 	 	silk	,	is	the	 strong 	 est 	 	of	these	 fiber 	 s 	 	.
we	think	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 drag 	 line 	 	silk	,	which	is	used	to	make	the	frame	and	 radi 	 i 	 	for	a	web	,	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	.
on	the	other	hand	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	look	at	 s 	 train 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	much	a	fiber	can	be	 extend 	 ed 	 	--	if	you	look	at	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	value	here	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	there	's	a	lot	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	and	the	clear	winner	is	 flag 	 elli 	 form 	 	,	or	the	capture	spiral	 fi 	 lament 	 	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	 flag 	 elli 	 form 	 	fiber	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	stretch	over	twice	 it 	 s 	 	original	length	.
so	silk	 fiber 	 s 	 	vary	in	 the 	 ir 	 	strength	and	 al 	 so 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 extens 	 ibility 	 	.
in	the	case	of	the	capture	spiral	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	so	 stretch 	 y 	 	to	absorb	the	impact	of	 fly 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	.
if	it	was	n't	able	to	stretch	so	much	,	then	 bas 	 ically 	 	when	an	insect	hit	the	web	,	it	would	just	 tramp 	 o 	 line 	 	right	off	of	it	.
so	if	the	web	was	made	 entire 	 ly 	 	out	of	 drag 	 line 	 	silk	,	an	insect	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	just	 bounc 	 e 	 	right	off	.	but	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 stretch 	 y 	 	capture	spiral	silk	,	the	web	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	able	to	absorb	the	impact	of	that	 inter 	 cept 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	.
there	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 fiber 	 s 	 	that	an	individual	spider	can	make	.
we	call	that	the	tool	kit	of	a	spider	.
that	's	what	the	spider	 ha 	 s 	 	to	interact	with	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	.
but	how	about	 vari 	 ation 	 	among	spider	species	,	so	looking	at	one	type	of	silk	and	looking	at	different	species	of	 spider 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	area	that	's	 large 	 ly 	 	 un 	 explore 	 d 	 	but	here	's	a	little	bit	of	data	i	can	show	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 compar 	 ison 	 	of	the	 tough 	 ness 	 	of	the	 drag 	 line 	 	 s 	 pil 	 k 	 	 s 	 pun 	 	by	21	species	of	 spider 	 s 	 	.
some	of	them	are	orb	-	weaving	 spider 	 s 	 	and	some	of	them	are	non	-	orb	-	weaving	 spider 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 hypothesize 	 d 	 	that	orb	-	weaving	 spider 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	argiope	here	,	should	have	the	 tough 	 est 	 	 drag 	 line 	 	 silk 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	must	 inter 	 cept 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	.
what	you	see	here	on	 th 	 is 	 	 tough 	 ness 	 	graph	is	the	 high 	 er 	 	the	black	dot	is	on	the	graph	,	the	 high 	 er 	 	the	 tough 	 ness 	 	.
the	21	species	are	 indic 	 ated 	 	here	by	 th 	 is 	 	 phyl 	 o 	 geny 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	tree	,	that	 show 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	genetic	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	 color 	 ed 	 	in	yellow	the	orb	-	web	-	weaving	 spider 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	right	here	at	the	two	red	 arrow 	 s 	 	,	they	point	to	the	 tough 	 ness 	 	 value 	 s 	 	for	the	 drag 	 lines 	 	of	nephila	clavipes	and	these	are	the	two	species	of	 spider 	 s 	 	for	which	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	time	and	money	on	synthetic	spider	silk	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	replicate	 the 	 ir 	 	 drag 	 line 	 	silk	 protein 	 s 	 	.
yet	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 drag 	 lines 	 	are	not	the	 tough 	 est 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	 tough 	 est 	 	 drag 	 line 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	survey	is	 th 	 is 	 	one	right	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	white	region	,	a	non	orb	-	web	-	weaving	spider	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 drag 	 line 	 	 s 	 pun 	 	by	scytodes	,	the	 s 	 pit 	 ting 	 	spider	.
scytodes	 do 	 es 	 	n't	use	a	web	at	all	to	catch	 pre 	 y 	 	.	 in 	 stead 	 	,	scytodes	sort	of	 lurk 	 s 	 	around	and	 wait 	 s 	 	for	 pre 	 y 	 	to	get	close	to	it	,	and	then	 im 	 mobilize 	 s 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	by	 spray 	 ing 	 	a	silk	-	like	venom	onto	that	insect	.
think	of	 hunt 	 ing 	 	with	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	string	.
that	's	how	scytodes	 for 	 age 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	why	scytodes	 need 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	tough	 drag 	 line 	 	,	but	it	's	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 result 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	that	make	bio	-	prospecting	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	and	 worth 	 while 	 	.
it	 free 	 s 	 	us	from	the	 constraint 	 s 	 	of	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
now	i	'm	going	to	mark	on	the	 tough 	 ness 	 	 value 	 s 	 	for	nylon	fiber	,	 bomb 	 yx 	 	--	or	 domestic 	 ated 	 	 silk 	 worm 	 	silk	--	wool	,	kevlar	,	and	carbon	 fiber 	 s 	 	.
and	what	you	can	see	is	that	 near 	 ly 	 	all	the	spider	 drag 	 lines 	 	surpass	them	.
it	's	the	combination	of	strength	,	 extens 	 ibility 	 	and	 tough 	 ness 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	spider	silk	so	special	,	and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 attract 	 ed 	 	the	attention	of	 biomimetic 	 ists 	 	,	so	people	that	turn	to	nature	to	try	to	find	new	 solution 	 s 	 	.
and	the	strength	,	 extens 	 ibility 	 	and	 tough 	 ness 	 	of	spider	 silk 	 s 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	with	the	fact	that	 silk 	 s 	 	do	not	elicit	an	 immun 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	have	 attract 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	interest	in	the	use	of	spider	 silk 	 s 	 	in	 bio 	 medical 	 	 application 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	component	of	artificial	 tend 	 on 	 s 	 	,	for	 serv 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 guide 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 grow 	 	 nerve 	 s 	 	,	and	for	 scaffold 	 s 	 	for	tissue	growth	.
spider	 silk 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	lot	of	potential	for	 the 	 ir 	 	anti	-	 ball 	 istic 	 	 cap 	 abilities 	 	.
 silk 	 s 	 	could	be	 incorpo 	 rated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	body	and	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	 arm 	 or 	 	that	would	be	more	 light 	 weight 	 	and	 flex 	 ible 	 	than	any	 arm 	 or 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	these	biomimetic	 application 	 s 	 	of	spider	 silk 	 s 	 	,	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	find	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	spider	 silk 	 s 	 	just	 fasci 	 nating 	 	in	and	of	 it 	 self 	 	.
i	love	when	i	'm	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	a	new	spider	silk	sequence	 come 	 s 	 	in	.
that	's	just	the	best	.
it	's	like	the	 spider 	 s 	 	are	sharing	an	ancient	secret	with	me	,	and	that	's	why	i	'm	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	rest	of	my	life	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	spider	silk	.
the	next	time	you	see	a	spider	web	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	pause	and	look	a	little	 close 	 r 	 	.
you	'll	be	 see 	 ing 	 	one	of	the	most	high	-	performance	 material 	 s 	 	known	to	man	.
to	borrow	from	the	 writing 	 s 	 	of	a	spider	named	charlotte	,	silk	is	 terr 	 ific 	 	.
thank	you	.
