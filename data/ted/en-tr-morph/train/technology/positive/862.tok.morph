for	the	next	few	 minute 	 s 	 	we	're	going	to	talk	about	energy	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	a	bit	of	a	 vari 	 ed 	 	talk	.
i	'll	try	to	spin	a	story	about	energy	,	and	oil	's	a	convenient	 start 	 ing 	 	place	.
the	talk	will	be	 broad 	 ly 	 	about	energy	,	but	oil	's	a	good	place	to	start	.
and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	 remark 	 able 	 	stuff	.
you	take	about	eight	or	so	carbon	 atom 	 s 	 	,	about	20	hydrogen	 atom 	 s 	 	,	you	put	them	together	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	right	way	and	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	 marvel 	 ous 	 	liquid	:	 ver 	 y 	 	energy	-	dense	and	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	refine	 in 	 to 	 	a	number	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 product 	 s 	 	and	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
it	's	great	stuff	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	,	there	's	a	lot	of	oil	out	there	in	the	world	.
here	's	my	little	pocket	map	of	where	it	's	all	 locate 	 d 	 	.
a	 big 	 ger 	 	one	for	you	to	look	at	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	oil	in	the	world	.
 geo 	 logists 	 	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	idea	of	where	the	oil	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	100	trillion	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	still	to	be	 develop 	 ed 	 	and	 produce 	 d 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
now	,	that	's	just	one	story	about	oil	,	and	we	could	end	it	there	and	say	,	``	well	,	oil	's	going	to	last	 fore 	 ver 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	well	,	there	's	just	a	lot	of	it	.	``
but	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	to	the	story	than	that	.
oh	,	by	the	way	,	if	you	think	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	far	from	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	oil	,	1000	 meter 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	where	you	're	all	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	is	one	of	the	largest	producing	oil	 field 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
come	talk	to	me	about	it	,	i	'll	fill	in	some	of	the	 detail 	 s 	 	if	you	want	.
so	,	that	's	one	of	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	oil	;	there	's	just	a	lot	of	it	.
but	what	about	oil	?	where	is	it	in	the	energy	system	?
here	's	a	little	 snap 	 shot 	 	of	150	 year 	 s 	 	of	oil	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 domin 	 ant 	 	part	of	our	energy	system	for	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	,	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	little	secret	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	:	for	the	last	25	 year 	 s 	 	,	oil	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	less	and	less	of	a	role	in	global	energy	 system 	 s 	 	.
there	was	one	kind	of	peak	oil	in	1985	,	when	oil	 represent 	 ed 	 	50	percent	of	global	energy	supply	.
now	,	it	's	about	35	percent	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 dec 	 lining 	 	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	decline	.
 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	consumption	in	the	u.s.	 prob 	 ably 	 	 peak 	 ed 	 	in	2007	and	is	 dec 	 lining 	 	.
so	oil	is	 play 	 ing 	 	a	less	significant	role	every	year	.
and	so	,	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	was	a	peak	oil	;	just	like	,	in	the	1920s	,	there	was	a	peak	coal	;	and	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	before	that	,	there	was	a	peak	wood	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	picture	of	the	evolution	of	energy	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	taking	up	the	 s 	 lack 	 	in	the	last	few	 decade 	 s 	 	?
well	,	a	lot	of	natural	gas	and	a	little	bit	of	nuclear	,	for	 start 	 ers 	 	.
and	what	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	the	future	?
well	,	i	think	out	 a 	 head 	 	of	us	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	is	peak	gas	,	and	beyond	that	,	peak	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	'll	tell	you	 an 	 other 	 	little	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	story	about	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
now	,	i	'm	not	 pretend 	 ing 	 	that	energy	use	in	total	is	n't	increasing	,	it	is	--	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	story	.	come	talk	to	me	about	it	,	we	'll	fill	in	some	of	the	 detail 	 s 	 	--	but	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	here	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	200	 year 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	for	200	 year 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	 de 	 carbon 	 izing 	 	our	energy	system	.
energy	 system 	 s 	 	of	the	world	 be 	 coming 	 	 progress 	 ively 	 	--	year	on	year	,	decade	on	decade	,	century	on	century	--	 be 	 coming 	 	less	carbon	 intens 	 e 	 	.
and	that	 continu 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	with	the	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 reach 	 ing 	 	 may 	 be 	 	30	percent	of	 prim 	 ary 	 	energy	by	mid	century	.
now	that	might	be	the	end	of	the	story	--	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	just	replace	it	all	with	 convention 	 al 	 	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	--	but	i	think	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	more	to	the	story	than	that	.
and	to	tell	the	next	part	of	the	story	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	looking	out	say	2100	and	beyond	.
what	is	the	future	of	 tru 	 ly 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	carbon	-	free	energy	?
well	,	we	have	to	take	a	little	 ex 	 cur 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	and	we	'll	start	in	central	texas	.
here	's	a	piece	of	 lime 	 stone 	 	.
i	 pick 	 ed 	 	it	up	 out 	 side 	 	of	 mar 	 ble 	 	 fall 	 s 	 	,	texas	.
it	's	about	400	million	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	it	's	just	 lime 	 stone 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	special	about	it	.
now	,	here	's	a	piece	of	chalk	.
i	 pick 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	up	at	mit	.	it	's	a	little	 young 	 er 	 	.
and	it	's	different	than	 th 	 is 	 	 lime 	 stone 	 	,	you	can	see	that	.
you	would	n't	build	a	building	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	and	you	would	n't	try	to	give	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	and	write	on	the	 chalk 	 board 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	different	--	no	,	it	's	not	different	.
it	's	not	different	,	it	's	the	same	stuff	:	 calc 	 ium 	 	 carbon 	 ate 	 	,	 calc 	 ium 	 	 carbon 	 ate 	 	.
what	's	different	is	how	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	put	together	.
now	,	if	you	think	that	's	kind	of	neat	,	the	story	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	neat	right	now	.
off	the	coast	of	california	 come 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	it	's	an	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	shell	.
now	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	every	year	make	 th 	 is 	 	shell	.
oh	,	by	the	way	,	just	in	case	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 al 	 ready 	 	 guess 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 calc 	 ium 	 	 carbon 	 ate 	 	.
it	's	the	same	stuff	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	the	same	stuff	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	it	's	not	the	same	stuff	;	it	's	different	.
it	's	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	3,000	 time 	 s 	 	 tough 	 er 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 low 	 ly 	 	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	is	able	to	lay	down	the	 calc 	 ium 	 	 carbon 	 ate 	 	 crystal 	 s 	 	in	 layer 	 s 	 	,	making	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 irid 	 escent 	 	mother	of	pearl	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 special 	 ized 	 	material	that	the	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	self	-	assembles	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	,	all	the	time	,	every	day	,	every	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	stuff	.
all	the	same	,	what	's	different	?
how	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	put	together	.
now	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	have	to	do	with	energy	?
here	's	a	piece	of	coal	.
and	i	'll	suggest	that	 th 	 is 	 	coal	is	about	 a 	 s 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	chalk	.
now	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 fuel 	 s 	 	or	energy	 car 	 rier 	 s 	 	,	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	novel	 material 	 s 	 	for	 batt 	 eries 	 	or	fuel	 cell 	 s 	 	,	nature	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	ever	built	 t 	 hose 	 	perfect	 material 	 s 	 	yet	 be 	 cause 	 	nature	did	n't	need	to	.
nature	did	n't	need	to	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 un 	 like 	 	the	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	shell	,	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	a	species	did	n't	depend	on	building	 t 	 hose 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	 may 	 be 	 	now	when	it	might	just	matter	.
so	,	when	we	think	about	the	future	of	energy	,	imagine	what	would	it	be	like	if	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	could	build	the	energy	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	just	by	 rear 	 ranging 	 	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	that	is	my	story	.
the	oil	will	never	run	out	.
it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	a	lot	of	it	.
it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	build	a	 ba 	 j 	 ill 	 ion 	 	 wind 	 mill 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	,	well	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	people	 invent 	 ed 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	--	they	had	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 innov 	 ations 	 	,	technology	--	and	the	stone	age	 end 	 ed 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	we	ran	out	of	 stone 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 idea 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	it	's	technology	that	will	end	the	age	of	oil	,	long	before	we	run	out	of	oil	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
