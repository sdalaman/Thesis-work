so	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	that	we	have	a	problem	with	 boy 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	a	serious	problem	with	 boy 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	culture	is	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	share	with	you	ways	that	we	can	think	about	 over 	 coming 	 	that	problem	.
first	,	i	want	to	start	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	boy	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	girl	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	 stereo 	 typical 	 ly 	 	what	you	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	a	boy	and	a	girl	.
if	i	 essential 	 ize 	 	gender	for	you	 to 	 day 	 	,	then	you	can	dismiss	what	i	have	to	say	.
so	i	'm	not	going	to	do	that	.	i	'm	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	different	kind	of	boy	and	a	different	kind	of	girl	.
so	the	point	here	is	that	not	all	 boy 	 s 	 	exist	 with 	 in 	 	these	rigid	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	what	we	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	not	all	 girl 	 s 	 	exist	 with 	 in 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	rigid	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	what	we	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	.
but	,	in	fact	,	most	 boy 	 s 	 	tend	to	be	a	certain	way	,	and	most	 girl 	 s 	 	tend	to	be	a	certain	way	.
and	the	point	is	that	,	for	 boy 	 s 	 	,	the	way	that	they	exist	and	the	culture	that	they	embrace	is	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	well	in	 school 	 s 	 	now	.
how	do	we	know	that	?
the	hundred	 girl 	 s 	 	project	 tell 	 s 	 	us	some	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	for	every	100	 girl 	 s 	 	that	are	 suspend 	 ed 	 	from	school	,	there	are	250	 boy 	 s 	 	that	are	 suspend 	 ed 	 	from	school	.
for	every	100	 girl 	 s 	 	who	are	 exp 	 ell 	 ed 	 	from	school	,	there	are	335	 boy 	 s 	 	who	are	 exp 	 ell 	 ed 	 	from	school	.
for	every	100	 girl 	 s 	 	in	special	education	,	there	are	217	 boy 	 s 	 	.
for	every	100	 girl 	 s 	 	with	a	 learn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 ability 	 	,	there	are	276	 boy 	 s 	 	.
for	every	100	 girl 	 s 	 	with	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	 disturb 	 ance 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	,	we	have	324	 boy 	 s 	 	.
and	by	the	way	,	all	of	these	 number 	 s 	 	are	 significant 	 ly 	 	 high 	 er 	 	if	you	happen	to	be	black	,	if	you	happen	to	be	poor	,	if	you	happen	to	exist	in	an	 over 	 crowd 	 ed 	 	school	.
and	if	you	are	a	boy	,	you	're	four	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	adhd	--	attention	 defici 	 t 	 	hyperactivity	 dis 	 order 	 	.
now	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	side	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	women	still	need	help	in	school	,	that	 s 	 al 	 aries 	 	are	still	 significant 	 ly 	 	lower	,	even	when	controlled	for	job	 type 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 girl 	 s 	 	have	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	struggle	in	math	and	science	for	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	's	all	true	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	about	that	 prevent 	 s 	 	us	from	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	the	 liter 	 acy 	 	 need 	 s 	 	of	our	 boy 	 s 	 	between	 age 	 s 	 	three	and	13	.
and	so	we	should	.
in	fact	,	what	we	ought	to	do	is	take	a	page	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 play 	 book 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 initi 	 ative 	 s 	 	and	 program 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	set	in	place	for	women	in	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	are	fantastic	.
they	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	of	good	for	 girl 	 s 	 	in	these	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	and	we	ought	to	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	we	can	make	that	happen	for	 boy 	 s 	 	too	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 young 	 er 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
even	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 old 	 er 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	what	we	find	is	that	there	's	still	a	problem	.
when	we	look	at	the	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	60	percent	of	 bacca 	 laureate 	 	 degree 	 s 	 	are	going	to	women	now	,	which	is	a	significant	shift	.
and	in	fact	,	university	 administr 	 ators 	 	are	a	little	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	about	the	idea	that	we	may	be	 get 	 ting 	 	close	to	70	percent	female	population	in	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	university	 administr 	 ators 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	nervous	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	do	n't	want	to	go	to	 school 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	have	 boy 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	the	 establish 	 ment 	 	of	men	 center 	 s 	 	and	men	 stud 	 ies 	 	to	think	about	how	do	we	engage	men	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	in	the	university	.
if	you	talk	to	 facul 	 ty 	 	,	they	may	say	,	``	ugh	.	 yea 	 h 	 	,	well	,	they	're	 play 	 ing 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 gam 	 bling 	 	 on 	 line 	 	all	night	long	,	and	they	're	 play 	 ing 	 	world	of	warcraft	,	and	that	's	 affect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	academic	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.	``
guess	what	?
video	 game 	 s 	 	are	not	the	cause	.
video	 game 	 s 	 	are	a	symptom	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	off	a	long	time	before	they	got	here	.
so	let	's	talk	about	why	they	got	 turn 	 ed 	 	off	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	between	the	 age 	 s 	 	of	three	and	13	.
there	are	three	 reason 	 s 	 	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 boy 	 s 	 	are	out	of	sync	with	the	culture	of	 school 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	first	is	zero	 toler 	 ance 	 	.
a	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	teacher	i	know	,	her	son	 don 	 ated 	 	all	of	his	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	to	her	,	and	when	he	did	,	she	had	to	go	through	and	pull	out	all	the	little	plastic	 gun 	 s 	 	.
you	ca	n't	have	plastic	knives	and	 s 	 word 	 s 	 	and	 axe 	 s 	 	and	all	that	kind	of	thing	in	a	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	 class 	 room 	 	.
what	is	it	that	we	're	 af 	 raid 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	young	man	is	going	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	gun	?
i	mean	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
but	here	he	 stand 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 test 	 a 	 ment 	 	to	the	fact	that	you	ca	n't	 rough 	 house 	 	on	the	 play 	 ground 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
now	i	'm	not	 advoc 	 ating 	 	for	 bull 	 ies 	 	.
i	'm	not	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	we	need	to	be	 allow 	 ing 	 	 gun 	 s 	 	and	knives	 in 	 to 	 	school	.
but	when	we	say	that	an	eagle	scout	in	a	high	school	 class 	 room 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 lock 	 ed 	 	 park 	 ed 	 	car	in	the	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	and	a	 pen 	 knife 	 	in	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 suspend 	 ed 	 	from	school	,	i	think	we	may	have	gone	a	little	too	far	with	zero	 toler 	 ance 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	way	that	zero	 toler 	 ance 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	out	is	in	the	writing	of	 boy 	 s 	 	.
in	a	lot	of	 class 	 rooms 	 	 to 	 day 	 	you	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	write	about	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	violent	.
you	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	write	about	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	video	 game 	 s 	 	--	these	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	are	 bann 	 ed 	 	.
boy	 come 	 s 	 	home	from	school	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	hate	writing	.	``
``	why	do	you	hate	writing	,	son	?	what	's	wrong	with	writing	?	``
``	now	i	have	to	write	what	she	 tell 	 s 	 	me	to	write	.	``
``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	what	is	she	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	to	write	?	``
``	 poem 	 s 	 	.	i	have	to	write	 poem 	 s 	 	.
and	little	 moment 	 s 	 	in	my	life	.
i	do	n't	want	to	write	that	stuff	.	``
``	all	right	.	well	,	what	do	you	want	to	write	?	what	do	you	want	to	write	about	?	``
``	i	want	to	write	about	video	 game 	 s 	 	.	i	want	to	write	about	 level 	 ing 	 	-	up	.
i	want	to	write	about	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	world	.
i	want	to	write	about	a	tornado	that	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	house	and	 blow 	 s 	 	all	the	 window 	 s 	 	out	and	 ruin 	 s 	 	all	the	furniture	and	 kill 	 s 	 	 every 	 body 	 	.	``
``	all	right	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	``
you	tell	a	teacher	that	,	and	they	'll	ask	you	,	in	all	 serious 	 ness 	 	,	``	should	we	 s 	 end 	 	 th 	 is 	 	child	to	the	 psycho 	 logist 	 	?	``
and	the	answer	is	no	,	he	's	just	a	boy	.
he	's	just	a	little	boy	.
it	's	not	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	write	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	that	's	the	first	reason	:	zero	 toler 	 ance 	 	 poli 	 cies 	 	and	the	way	they	're	lived	out	.
the	next	reason	that	 boy 	 s 	 	'	 culture 	 s 	 	are	out	of	sync	with	school	 culture 	 s 	 	:	there	are	 few 	 er 	 	male	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 body 	 	who	's	over	15	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	number	of	 element 	 ary 	 	school	 class 	 room 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	cut	in	half	.
we	went	from	14	percent	to	seven	percent	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	93	percent	of	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	that	our	young	men	get	in	 element 	 ary 	 	 class 	 rooms 	 	are	women	.
now	what	's	the	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
women	are	great	.	 y 	 ep 	 	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	.
but	male	role	 model 	 s 	 	for	 boy 	 s 	 	that	say	it	's	all	right	to	be	smart	--	they	've	got	 dad 	 s 	 	,	they	've	got	 pastor 	 s 	 	,	they	've	got	cub	scout	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	six	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	,	five	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	they	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	,	and	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 class 	 rooms 	 	are	not	 place 	 s 	 	where	men	exist	.
and	so	they	say	,	i	guess	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	n't	a	place	for	 boy 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	place	for	 girl 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	i	guess	i	'd	better	go	play	video	 game 	 s 	 	or	get	 in 	 to 	 	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 obvious 	 ly 	 	do	n't	belong	here	.
men	do	n't	belong	here	,	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	obvious	.
so	that	may	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	direct	way	that	we	see	it	happen	.
but	less	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	the	lack	of	male	presence	in	the	culture	--	you	've	got	a	 teacher 	 s 	 	'	 loung 	 e 	 	,	and	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	about	joey	and	johnny	who	beat	each	other	up	on	the	 play 	 ground 	 	.
``	what	are	we	going	to	do	with	these	 boy 	 s 	 	?	``
the	answer	to	that	question	 change 	 s 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	who	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	around	that	table	.
are	there	men	around	that	table	?
are	there	 mom 	 s 	 	who	've	raised	 boy 	 s 	 	around	that	table	?
you	'll	see	,	the	conversation	 change 	 s 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	 up 	 on 	 	who	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	around	the	table	.
third	reason	that	 boy 	 s 	 	are	out	of	sync	with	school	 to 	 day 	 	:	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	is	the	old	second	grade	,	 folk 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	serious	 compress 	 ion 	 	of	the	curriculum	 happen 	 ing 	 	out	there	.
when	you	're	three	,	you	better	be	able	to	write	your	name	 leg 	 ibly 	 	,	or	else	we	'll	consider	it	a	 develop 	 mental 	 	delay	.
by	the	time	you	're	in	first	grade	,	you	should	be	able	to	read	 para 	 graph 	 s 	 	of	text	with	 may 	 be 	 	a	picture	,	 may 	 be 	 	not	,	in	a	book	of	 may 	 be 	 	25	to	30	 page 	 s 	 	.
if	you	do	n't	,	we	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	be	 put 	 ting 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	a	title	1	special	 read 	 ing 	 	program	.
and	if	you	ask	title	1	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	tell	you	they	've	got	about	four	or	five	 boy 	 s 	 	for	every	girl	that	's	in	 the 	 ir 	 	program	,	in	the	 element 	 ary 	 	 grade 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 mess 	 age 	 	that	 boy 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	is	``	you	need	to	do	what	the	teacher	 ask 	 s 	 	you	to	do	all	the	time	.	``
the	teacher	's	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	``	no	child	left	 be 	 hind 	 	``	and	``	race	to	the	top	``	and	 account 	 ability 	 	and	 test 	 ing 	 	and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	she	 ha 	 s 	 	to	figure	out	a	way	to	get	all	these	 boy 	 s 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	curriculum	--	and	 girl 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 compress 	 ed 	 	curriculum	is	bad	for	all	active	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	 s 	 it 	 	down	,	be	quiet	,	do	what	you	're	told	,	follow	the	 rule 	 s 	 	,	manage	your	time	,	focus	,	be	a	girl	.	``
that	's	what	she	 tell 	 s 	 	them	.
 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	what	she	 tell 	 s 	 	them	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	problem	.	where	is	it	coming	from	?
it	's	coming	from	us	.
we	want	our	 bab 	 ies 	 	to	read	when	they	are	six	 month 	 s 	 	old	.
have	you	 s 	 een 	 	the	 ad 	 s 	 	?
we	want	to	live	in	lake	wobegon	where	every	child	is	above	average	,	but	what	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	to	our	children	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 health 	 y 	 	.
it	's	not	 develop 	 ment 	 ally 	 	appropriate	,	and	it	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	bad	for	 boy 	 s 	 	.
so	what	do	we	do	?
we	need	to	meet	them	where	they	are	.
we	need	to	put	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	boy	culture	.
we	need	to	change	the	 mind 	 set 	 	of	 accept 	 ance 	 	in	 boy 	 s 	 	in	 element 	 ary 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
more	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	we	can	do	some	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	can	design	better	 game 	 s 	 	.
most	of	the	 education 	 al 	 	 game 	 s 	 	that	are	out	there	 to 	 day 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 flash 	 card 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 glor 	 ified 	 	drill	and	practice	.
they	do	n't	have	the	depth	,	the	rich	narrative	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	have	,	that	the	 boy 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
so	we	need	to	design	better	 game 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	talk	to	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 parent 	 s 	 	and	school	board	 member 	 s 	 	and	 politic 	 ians 	 	.
we	need	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	people	see	that	we	need	more	men	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
we	need	to	look	 care 	 fully 	 	at	our	zero	 toler 	 ance 	 	 poli 	 cies 	 	.
do	they	make	sense	?
we	need	to	think	about	how	to	 un 	 compress 	 	 th 	 is 	 	curriculum	if	we	can	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	a	space	that	is	 comfort 	 able 	 	for	them	.
all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	need	to	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
there	are	some	great	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	out	there	of	 school 	 s 	 	--	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	just	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	a	school	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
a	game	 design 	 er 	 	from	the	new	school	put	together	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	video	 gam 	 ing 	 	school	.
but	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 treat 	 s 	 	a	few	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 scal 	 able 	 	.
we	have	to	change	the	culture	and	the	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	 politic 	 ians 	 	and	school	board	 member 	 s 	 	and	 parent 	 s 	 	have	about	the	way	we	accept	and	what	we	accept	in	our	 school 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	need	to	find	more	money	for	game	design	.
 be 	 cause 	 	good	 game 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 game 	 s 	 	,	cost	money	,	and	world	of	warcraft	 ha 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	budget	.
most	of	the	 education 	 al 	 	 game 	 s 	 	do	not	.
where	we	 start 	 ed 	 	:	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	--	 mi 	 ke 	 	petner	,	shawn	vashaw	,	 my 	 self 	 	--	we	 start 	 ed 	 	by	 try 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	'	 attitude 	 s 	 	and	find	out	how	do	they	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	about	 gam 	 ing 	 	,	what	do	they	say	about	it	.
and	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	they	talk	about	the	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	school	,	who	talk	about	 gam 	 ing 	 	,	in	 pre 	 tty 	 	 de 	 meaning 	 	ways	.
they	say	,	``	oh	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	that	stuff	.
they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	little	action	 figure 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	or	merit	 badge 	 s 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	that	they	get	.
and	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	``
and	they	say	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
but	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	your	culture	,	think	of	how	that	might	feel	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	to	be	on	the	 receiv 	 ing 	 	end	of	that	kind	of	language	.
they	're	nervous	about	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	violence	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	zero	 toler 	 ance 	 	 poli 	 cies 	 	.
they	are	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 administr 	 ators 	 	will	never	accept	 any 	 thing 	 	.
so	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	think	about	looking	at	teacher	 attitude 	 s 	 	and	 find 	 ing 	 	ways	to	change	the	 attitude 	 s 	 	so	that	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	much	more	open	and	 accept 	 ing 	 	of	boy	 culture 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	if	we	do	n't	,	then	we	're	going	to	have	 boy 	 s 	 	who	 leav 	 e 	 	 element 	 ary 	 	school	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	i	guess	that	was	just	a	place	for	 girl 	 s 	 	.
it	was	n't	for	me	.
so	i	've	got	to	do	 gam 	 ing 	 	,	or	i	've	got	to	do	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	.	``
if	we	change	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	if	we	pay	attention	to	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	re	-	engage	 boy 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	they	will	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 element 	 ary 	 	 school 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	'm	smart	.	``
