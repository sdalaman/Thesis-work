it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	we	're	all	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	information	 over 	 load 	 	or	data	glut	.
and	the	good	news	is	there	might	be	an	easy	solution	to	that	,	and	that	's	using	our	 eye 	 s 	 	more	.
so	,	 visual 	 izing 	 	information	,	so	that	we	can	see	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	 connect 	 ions 	 	that	matter	and	then	 design 	 ing 	 	that	information	so	it	 make 	 s 	 	more	sense	,	or	it	 tell 	 s 	 	a	story	,	or	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	focus	 on 	 ly 	 	on	the	information	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 fail 	 ing 	 	that	,	 visual 	 ized 	 	information	can	just	look	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
so	,	let	's	see	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	$	billion	dollar	o	-	gram	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	image	 a 	 rose 	 	out	of	 frust 	 ration 	 	i	had	with	the	 report 	 ing 	 	of	billion	-	dollar	 amount 	 s 	 	in	the	press	.
that	is	,	they	're	 meaning 	 less 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 con 	 text 	 	:	500	billion	for	 th 	 is 	 	 pipe 	 line 	 	,	20	billion	for	 th 	 is 	 	war	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	,	so	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	understand	it	is	 visual 	 ly 	 	and	 relat 	 ively 	 	.
so	i	 scrap 	 ed 	 	a	load	of	 report 	 ed 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	from	 vari 	 ous 	 	news	 out 	 lets 	 	and	then	 scale 	 d 	 	the	boxes	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 amount 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 color 	 s 	 	here	represent	the	 motiv 	 ation 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	money	.
so	 pur 	 ple 	 	is	``	 fight 	 ing 	 	,	``	and	red	is	``	giving	money	away	,	``	and	green	is	``	 profit 	 eer 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	what	you	can	see	straight	away	is	you	start	to	have	a	different	relationship	to	the	 number 	 s 	 	.
you	can	 liter 	 ally 	 	see	them	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	you	start	to	see	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	 number 	 s 	 	that	would	 other 	 wise 	 	be	 scatter 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	news	 report 	 s 	 	.
let	me	point	out	some	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	opec	's	revenue	,	 th 	 is 	 	green	box	here	--	780	billion	a	year	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	little	pixel	in	the	corner	--	three	billion	--	that	's	 the 	 ir 	 	climate	change	fund	.
americans	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	people	--	over	300	billion	a	year	,	 don 	 ated 	 	to	 char 	 ity 	 	every	year	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	the	amount	of	foreign	aid	 give 	 n 	 	by	the	top	17	 industrial 	 ized 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	at	120	billion	.
then	of	course	,	the	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	,	 predict 	 ed 	 	to	cost	just	60	billion	back	in	2003	.
and	it	 mushroom 	 ed 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	.	afghanistan	and	 ir 	 aq 	 	 mushroom 	 ed 	 	now	to	3,000	billion	.
so	now	it	's	great	 be 	 cause 	 	now	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 text 	 ure 	 	,	and	we	can	add	 number 	 s 	 	to	it	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	we	could	say	,	well	,	a	new	figure	 come 	 s 	 	out	...	let	's	see	african	debt	.
how	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	do	you	think	might	be	taken	up	by	the	debt	that	africa	 owe 	 s 	 	to	the	west	?
let	's	take	a	look	.
so	there	it	is	:	227	billion	is	what	africa	 owe 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 re 	 cent 	 	financial	crisis	,	how	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	might	that	figure	take	up	?
what	 ha 	 s 	 	that	cost	the	world	?	let	's	take	a	look	at	that	.
dooosh	--	which	i	think	is	the	appropriate	sound	effect	for	that	much	money	:	11,900	billion	.
so	,	by	 visual 	 izing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	we	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	that	you	can	explore	with	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	a	kind	of	map	 re 	 ally 	 	,	a	sort	of	information	map	.
and	when	you	're	lost	in	information	,	an	information	map	is	kind	of	 use 	 ful 	 	.
so	i	want	to	show	you	 an 	 other 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	now	.
we	need	to	imagine	what	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	the	world	's	 fear 	 s 	 	might	look	like	.
let	's	take	a	look	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 mountain 	 s 	 	out	of	molehills	,	a	 time 	 line 	 	of	global	media	panic	.
so	,	i	'll	label	 th 	 is 	 	for	you	in	a	second	.
but	the	height	here	,	i	want	to	point	out	,	is	the	 intens 	 ity 	 	of	certain	 fear 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	in	the	media	.
let	me	point	them	out	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	,	 s 	 wine 	 	flu	--	pink	.
bird	flu	.
sars	--	 brow 	 nish 	 	here	.	remember	that	one	?
the	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	bug	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	disaster	.
these	little	green	 peak 	 s 	 	are	 a 	 steroid 	 	 collision 	 s 	 	.
and	in	summer	,	here	,	killer	 wasp 	 s 	 	.
so	these	are	what	our	 fear 	 s 	 	look	like	over	time	in	our	media	.
but	what	i	love	--	and	i	'm	a	journalist	--	and	what	i	love	is	 find 	 ing 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	;	i	love	 be 	 ing 	 	a	data	 detect 	 ive 	 	.
and	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	odd	pattern	 hid 	 den 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	data	that	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	see	when	you	 visual 	 ize 	 	it	.
let	me	 high 	 light 	 	it	for	you	.
see	 th 	 is 	 	line	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	for	violent	video	 game 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	there	's	a	kind	of	odd	,	regular	pattern	in	the	data	,	 t 	 win 	 	 peak 	 s 	 	every	year	.
if	we	look	 close 	 r 	 	,	we	see	 t 	 hose 	 	 peak 	 s 	 	occur	at	the	same	month	every	year	.
why	?
well	,	november	,	christmas	video	 game 	 s 	 	come	out	,	and	there	may	well	be	an	 up 	 s 	 urge 	 	in	the	concern	about	 the 	 ir 	 	content	.
but	april	is	n't	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	massive	month	for	video	 game 	 s 	 	.
why	april	?
well	,	in	april	1999	was	the	columbine	 shoot 	 ing 	 	,	and	since	then	,	that	fear	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 remember 	 ed 	 	by	the	media	and	 echo 	 es 	 	through	the	group	mind	 gradu 	 ally 	 	through	the	year	.
you	have	 retrospect 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	 annivers 	 aries 	 	,	court	 case 	 s 	 	,	even	copy	-	cat	 shoot 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	all	 push 	 ing 	 	that	fear	 in 	 to 	 	the	agenda	.
and	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	pattern	here	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	can	you	spot	it	?
see	that	gap	there	?	there	's	a	gap	,	and	it	 affect 	 s 	 	all	the	other	 st 	 ories 	 	.
why	is	there	a	gap	there	?
you	see	where	it	 start 	 s 	 	?	september	2001	,	when	we	had	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	real	to	be	 scar 	 ed 	 	about	.
so	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	data	journalist	for	about	a	year	,	and	i	keep	 hear 	 ing 	 	a	phrase	all	the	time	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	data	is	the	new	oil	.	``
data	is	the	kind	of	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	resource	that	we	can	shape	to	provide	new	 innov 	 ations 	 	and	new	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	all	around	us	,	and	it	can	be	 min 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
it	's	not	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	great	metaphor	in	these	 time 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	live	around	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	,	but	i	would	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	adapt	 th 	 is 	 	metaphor	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	,	and	i	would	say	that	data	is	the	new	 s 	 oil 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	for	me	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	a	 fertil 	 e 	 	,	creative	medium	.
over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	 on 	 line 	 	,	we	've	laid	down	a	huge	amount	of	information	and	data	,	and	we	 irrig 	 ate 	 	it	with	 network 	 s 	 	and	 connect 	 ivity 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	and	 till 	 ed 	 	by	 un 	 paid 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	and	 government 	 s 	 	.
and	,	all	right	,	i	'm	kind	of	 milk 	 ing 	 	the	metaphor	a	little	bit	.
but	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 fertil 	 e 	 	medium	,	and	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	 visual 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	 info 	 graphic 	 s 	 	,	data	 visual 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	they	feel	like	 flower 	 s 	 	 bloom 	 ing 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	medium	.
but	if	you	look	at	it	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	just	a	lot	of	 number 	 s 	 	and	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	start	 work 	 ing 	 	with	it	and	 play 	 ing 	 	with	it	in	a	certain	way	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	can	appear	and	different	 pattern 	 s 	 	can	be	 reveal 	 ed 	 	.
let	me	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	.
can	you	guess	what	 th 	 is 	 	data	set	is	?
what	 rise 	 s 	 	twice	a	year	,	once	in	easter	and	then	two	 week 	 s 	 	before	christmas	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mini	peak	every	monday	,	and	then	 flatten 	 s 	 	out	over	the	summer	?
i	'll	take	 answer 	 s 	 	.
david	mccandless	:	chocolate	.
you	might	want	to	get	some	chocolate	in	.
any	other	 guess 	 es 	 	?
dm	:	 shop 	 ping 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	 re 	 tail 	 	therapy	might	help	.
dm	:	sick	 leav 	 e 	 	.	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	'll	 definite 	 ly 	 	want	to	take	some	time	off	.
 s 	 hall 	 	we	see	?
so	,	the	information	guru	lee	byron	and	 my 	 self 	 	,	we	 scrap 	 ed 	 	10,000	 stat 	 us 	 	facebook	 update 	 s 	 	for	the	phrase	``	break	-	up	``	and	``	broken	-	up	``	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	pattern	we	found	--	people	 clear 	 ing 	 	out	for	spring	break	,	coming	out	of	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	on	a	monday	,	 be 	 ing 	 	single	over	the	summer	,	and	then	the	 low 	 est 	 	day	of	the	year	,	of	course	:	christmas	day	.
who	would	do	that	?
so	there	's	a	 titan 	 ic 	 	amount	of	data	out	there	now	,	unprecedented	.
but	if	you	ask	the	right	kind	of	question	,	or	you	work	it	in	the	right	kind	of	way	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	can	emerge	.
so	information	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.	data	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
i	wonder	if	i	could	make	my	life	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	here	's	my	visual	c.v	.
i	'm	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	i	've	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	 block 	 y 	 	,	the	 color 	 s 	 	are	n't	that	great	.
but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	convey	 some 	 thing 	 	to	you	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 programm 	 er 	 	,	and	then	i	 work 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	writer	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	print	,	 on 	 line 	 	and	then	in	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	have	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	to	design	school	.
i	've	never	 stud 	 ied 	 	art	or	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	just	kind	of	 learn 	 ed 	 	through	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	an	odd	thing	about	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	 al 	 ready 	 	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	design	,	but	it	was	n't	like	i	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	at	it	,	but	more	like	i	was	sensitive	to	the	 idea 	 s 	 	of	 grid 	 s 	 	and	space	and	 align 	 ment 	 	and	 typo 	 graphy 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	 be 	 ing 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	all	 th 	 is 	 	media	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	had	 instill 	 ed 	 	a	kind	of	 dorm 	 ant 	 	design	 liter 	 acy 	 	in	me	.
and	i	do	n't	feel	like	i	'm	 un 	 ique 	 	.
i	feel	that	 every 	 day 	 	,	all	of	us	now	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 blast 	 ed 	 	by	information	design	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 pour 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 eye 	 s 	 	through	the	web	,	and	we	're	all	 visual 	 izer 	 s 	 	now	;	we	're	all	 demand 	 ing 	 	a	visual	 a 	 spect 	 	to	our	information	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 magic 	 al 	 	about	visual	information	.
it	's	 effort 	 less 	 	,	it	 liter 	 ally 	 	 pour 	 s 	 	in	.
and	if	you	're	 navig 	 ating 	 	a	dense	information	jungle	,	coming	 a 	 cross 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	graphic	or	a	 love 	 ly 	 	data	 visual 	 ization 	 	,	it	's	a	relief	,	it	's	like	coming	 a 	 cross 	 	a	 clear 	 ing 	 	in	the	jungle	.
i	was	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	it	led	me	to	the	work	of	a	danish	physicist	 call 	 ed 	 	tor	norretranders	,	and	he	 convert 	 ed 	 	the	 band 	 width 	 	of	the	 sense 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	computer	 term 	 s 	 	.
so	here	we	go	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	your	 sense 	 s 	 	,	 pour 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	 sense 	 s 	 	every	second	.
your	sense	of	sight	is	the	 fast 	 est 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	 band 	 width 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	computer	network	.
then	you	have	touch	,	which	is	about	the	speed	of	a	usb	key	.
and	then	you	have	 hear 	 ing 	 	and	smell	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 through 	 put 	 	of	a	hard	 dis 	 k 	 	.
and	then	you	have	poor	old	taste	,	which	is	like	 bare 	 ly 	 	the	 through 	 put 	 	of	a	pocket	 calcul 	 ator 	 	.
and	that	little	square	in	the	corner	,	a	naught	.7	percent	,	that	's	the	amount	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	aware	of	.
so	a	lot	of	your	vision	--	the	bulk	of	it	is	visual	,	and	it	's	 pour 	 ing 	 	in	.
it	's	 un 	 conscious 	 	.
the	eye	is	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	sensitive	to	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	 vari 	 ations 	 	in	color	,	shape	and	pattern	.
it	 love 	 s 	 	them	,	and	it	 call 	 s 	 	them	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
it	's	the	language	of	the	eye	.
if	you	combine	the	language	of	the	eye	with	the	language	of	the	mind	,	which	is	about	 word 	 s 	 	and	 number 	 s 	 	and	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	you	start	 s 	 peaking 	 	two	 language 	 s 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	each	enhancing	the	other	.
so	,	you	have	the	eye	,	and	then	you	drop	in	the	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
and	that	whole	thing	--	it	's	two	 language 	 s 	 	both	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	same	time	.
so	we	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	new	kind	of	language	,	if	you	like	,	to	alter	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	or	change	our	 view 	 s 	 	.
let	me	ask	you	a	simple	question	with	a	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	answer	:	who	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	budget	?
it	's	got	to	be	america	,	right	?
massive	.	609	billion	in	2008	--	607	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	.
so	massive	,	in	fact	,	that	it	can	contain	all	the	other	 militar 	 y 	 	 budget 	 s 	 	in	the	world	 in 	 side 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
 go 	 bble 	 	,	 go 	 bble 	 	,	 go 	 bble 	 	,	 go 	 bble 	 	,	 go 	 bble 	 	.
now	,	you	can	see	africa	's	total	debt	there	and	the	u.k.	budget	 defici 	 t 	 	for	 re 	 ference 	 	.
so	that	might	well	chime	with	your	view	that	america	is	a	sort	of	 warm 	 ong 	 er 	 ing 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	machine	,	out	to	 over 	 power 	 	the	world	with	 it 	 s 	 	huge	industrial	-	 militar 	 y 	 	complex	.
but	is	it	true	that	america	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	budget	?
 be 	 cause 	 	america	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	rich	country	.
in	fact	,	it	's	so	 massive 	 ly 	 	rich	that	it	can	contain	the	four	other	top	 industrial 	 ized 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	'	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	it	's	so	 vast 	 ly 	 	rich	.
so	 it 	 s 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	budget	is	bound	to	be	enormous	.
so	,	to	be	fair	and	to	alter	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	we	have	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	data	set	,	and	that	data	set	is	gdp	,	or	the	country	's	 earn 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
who	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	budget	 a 	 s 	 	a	proportion	of	gdp	?
let	's	have	a	look	.
that	 change 	 s 	 	the	picture	 consider 	 ably 	 	.
other	 count 	 ries 	 	pop	 in 	 to 	 	view	that	you	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 consider 	 ing 	 	,	and	american	 drop 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	eighth	.
now	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
who	 ha 	 s 	 	the	most	 soldier 	 s 	 	?	it	's	got	to	be	 chin 	 a 	 	.
of	course	,	2.1	million	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 chi 	 ming 	 	with	your	view	that	 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 militar 	 ized 	 	regime	ready	to	,	you	know	,	mobilize	 it 	 s 	 	enormous	 force 	 s 	 	.
but	of	course	,	 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	enormous	population	.
so	if	we	do	the	same	,	we	see	a	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	picture	.
 chin 	 a 	 	 drop 	 s 	 	to	124th	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 arm 	 y 	 	when	you	take	other	data	 in 	 to 	 	 consider 	 ation 	 	.
so	,	absolute	 figure 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 militar 	 y 	 	budget	,	in	a	 connect 	 ed 	 	world	,	do	n't	give	you	the	whole	picture	.
they	're	not	 a 	 s 	 	true	 a 	 s 	 	they	could	be	.
we	need	 relat 	 ive 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	that	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	other	data	so	that	we	can	see	a	 full 	 er 	 	picture	,	and	then	that	can	lead	to	us	changing	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	hans	rosling	,	the	master	,	my	master	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	the	 data 	 set 	 	change	your	 mind 	 set 	 	.	``
and	if	it	can	do	that	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	change	your	behavior	.
take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
i	'm	a	bit	of	a	health	nut	.
i	love	taking	 supplement 	 s 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	fit	,	but	i	can	never	understand	what	's	going	on	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	evidence	.
there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 conflict 	 ing 	 	evidence	.
should	i	take	 vita 	 min 	 	c	?	should	i	be	taking	 wheat 	 grass 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 visual 	 ization 	 	of	all	the	evidence	for	 nutrition 	 al 	 	 supplement 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 dia 	 gram 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	balloon	race	.
so	the	 high 	 er 	 	up	the	image	,	the	more	evidence	there	is	for	each	supplement	.
and	the	 bubble 	 s 	 	correspond	to	 popular 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 regard 	 s 	 	to	google	 hit 	 s 	 	.
so	you	can	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 ap 	 prehend 	 	the	relationship	between	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	and	 popular 	 ity 	 	,	but	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	,	if	you	grade	the	evidence	,	do	a	``	worth	it	``	line	.
so	 supplement 	 s 	 	above	 th 	 is 	 	line	are	worth	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	 condition 	 s 	 	 list 	 ed 	 	 be 	 low 	 	,	and	then	the	 supplement 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	line	are	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	worth	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	image	 constitute 	 s 	 	a	huge	amount	of	work	.
we	 scrap 	 ed 	 	like	1,000	 stud 	 ies 	 	from	pubmed	,	the	 bio 	 medical 	 	 data 	 base 	 	,	and	we	 compil 	 ed 	 	them	and	 grad 	 ed 	 	them	all	.
and	it	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	for	me	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	a	book	of	250	 visual 	 ization 	 s 	 	to	do	for	my	book	,	and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	month	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	 on 	 ly 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	two	 page 	 s 	 	.
but	what	it	 point 	 s 	 	to	is	that	 visual 	 izing 	 	information	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	form	of	knowledge	 compress 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	a	way	of	 squeez 	 ing 	 	an	enormous	amount	of	information	and	 understand 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	small	space	.
and	once	you	've	 cur 	 ated 	 	that	data	,	and	once	you	've	 clean 	 ed 	 	that	data	,	and	once	it	's	there	,	you	can	do	cool	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	i	 convert 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 inter 	 active 	 	app	,	so	i	can	now	generate	 th 	 is 	 	application	 on 	 line 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 visual 	 ization 	 	 on 	 line 	 	--	and	i	can	say	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.	``
so	it	 spawn 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	then	i	can	say	,	``	well	,	just	show	me	the	stuff	that	 affect 	 s 	 	heart	health	.	``
so	let	's	filter	that	out	.
so	heart	is	 filter 	 ed 	 	out	,	so	i	can	see	if	i	'm	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	that	.
i	think	,	``	no	,	no	.	i	do	n't	want	to	take	any	 synthetic 	 s 	 	,	i	just	want	to	see	 plant 	 s 	 	and	--	just	show	me	 herb 	 s 	 	and	 plant 	 s 	 	.	i	've	got	all	the	natural	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.	``
now	 th 	 is 	 	app	is	 spawn 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	from	the	data	.
the	data	is	all	 store 	 d 	 	in	a	google	doc	,	and	it	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	generating	 it 	 self 	 	from	that	data	.
so	the	data	is	now	 al 	 ive 	 	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	living	image	,	and	i	can	update	it	in	a	second	.
new	evidence	 come 	 s 	 	out	.	i	just	change	a	row	on	a	 spread 	 sheet 	 	.
doosh	!	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	image	 re 	 create 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	it	's	cool	.
it	's	kind	of	living	.
but	it	can	go	beyond	data	,	and	it	can	go	beyond	 number 	 s 	 	.
i	like	to	 app 	 ly 	 	information	 visual 	 ization 	 	to	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 visual 	 ization 	 	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	spectrum	,	an	attempt	for	me	to	try	and	understand	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	and	how	the	 idea 	 s 	 	 per 	 col 	 ate 	 	down	from	government	 in 	 to 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	culture	,	 in 	 to 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 belief 	 s 	 	and	back	around	 aga 	 in 	 	in	a	cycle	.
what	i	love	about	 th 	 is 	 	image	is	it	's	made	up	of	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	it	 explore 	 s 	 	our	 world 	 view 	 s 	 	and	it	 help 	 s 	 	us	--	it	 help 	 s 	 	me	 any 	 way 	 	--	to	see	what	 other 	 s 	 	think	,	to	see	where	they	're	coming	from	.
and	it	 feel 	 s 	 	just	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	cool	to	do	that	.
what	was	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	for	me	 design 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	that	,	when	i	was	 design 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	i	 desperate 	 ly 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	the	left	side	,	to	be	better	than	the	right	side	--	 be 	 ing 	 	a	journalist	,	a	left	-	 lean 	 ing 	 	person	--	but	i	could	n't	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	would	have	 create 	 d 	 	a	 lop 	 sided 	 	,	 bias 	 ed 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
so	,	in	order	to	 re 	 ally 	 	create	a	full	image	,	i	had	to	honor	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	on	the	right	-	hand	side	and	at	the	same	time	,	 un 	 comfort 	 ably 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	me	,	which	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 annoy 	 ing 	 	and	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
but	not	too	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 threaten 	 ing 	 	about	 see 	 ing 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	told	or	 force 	 d 	 	to	listen	to	one	.
you	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 hold 	 ing 	 	 conflict 	 ing 	 	 view 	 point 	 s 	 	 joy 	 ously 	 	when	you	can	see	them	.
it	's	even	 f 	 un 	 	to	engage	with	them	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	visual	.
so	that	's	what	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	me	,	 see 	 ing 	 	how	data	can	change	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	and	change	my	mind	 mid 	 stream 	 	--	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 love 	 ly 	 	data	.
so	,	just	to	wrap	up	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	that	it	 feel 	 s 	 	to	me	that	design	is	about	solving	 problem 	 s 	 	and	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	elegant	 solution 	 s 	 	,	and	information	design	is	about	solving	information	 problem 	 s 	 	.
it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	we	have	a	lot	of	information	 problem 	 s 	 	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	at	the	moment	,	from	the	 over 	 load 	 	and	the	 s 	 atur 	 ation 	 	to	the	 break 	 down 	 	of	trust	and	 reli 	 ability 	 	and	 run 	 away 	 	 skeptic 	 ism 	 	and	lack	of	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	or	even	just	 interest 	 ing 	 ness 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	find	information	just	too	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	quality	that	 draw 	 s 	 	me	in	.
so	,	 visual 	 izing 	 	information	can	give	us	a	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	solution	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
even	when	the	information	is	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	the	visual	can	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
often	we	can	get	 clar 	 ity 	 	or	the	answer	to	a	simple	question	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	the	 re 	 cent 	 	icelandic	 volcan 	 o 	 	.
which	was	 emit 	 ting 	 	the	most	co	2	?
was	it	the	 plane 	 s 	 	or	the	 volcan 	 o 	 	,	the	 ground 	 ed 	 	 plane 	 s 	 	or	the	 volcan 	 o 	 	?
so	we	can	have	a	look	.
we	look	at	the	data	and	we	see	:	 y 	 ep 	 	,	the	 volcan 	 o 	 	 emit 	 ted 	 	150,000	 ton 	 s 	 	;	the	 ground 	 ed 	 	 plane 	 s 	 	would	have	 emit 	 ted 	 	345,000	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	sky	.
so	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	we	had	our	first	carbon	-	neutral	 volcan 	 o 	 	.
and	that	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.	thank	you	.
