 pleas 	 e 	 	welcome	claron	mcfadden	.
claron	mcfadden	:	the	human	voice	:	 myster 	 ious 	 	,	 spontane 	 ous 	 	,	 prim 	 al 	 	.
for	me	,	the	human	voice	is	the	vessel	on	which	all	 emotion 	 s 	 	travel	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 jealous 	 y 	 	.
and	the	breath	,	the	breath	is	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	of	that	vessel	.
a	child	is	born	,	 take 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	first	breath	--	and	we	 be 	 hold 	 	the	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	vocal	 express 	 ion 	 	--	 myster 	 ious 	 	,	 spontane 	 ous 	 	and	 prim 	 al 	 	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	did	a	 medit 	 ation 	 	 re 	 treat 	 	in	thailand	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	a	place	that	i	would	have	total	silence	and	total	 s 	 ol 	 itude 	 	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 treat 	 	in	my	own	little	hut	--	no	music	,	no	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 sound 	 s 	 	of	nature	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 concent 	 ration 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	moment	.
on	my	last	day	,	the	woman	who	 look 	 ed 	 	after	the	place	,	she	came	and	we	spoke	for	a	minute	,	and	then	she	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	would	you	 s 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	for	me	?	``
and	i	thought	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	place	of	total	quiet	and	silence	.
i	ca	n't	make	noise	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	 s 	 ing 	 	for	me	.	``
so	i	closed	my	 eye 	 s 	 	,	i	took	breath	and	the	first	thing	that	came	up	and	out	was	``	 summer 	 time 	 	,	``	porgy	and	bess	.
♫	 summer 	 time 	 	and	the	living	is	easy	♫	♫	fish	are	 jump 	 ing 	 	and	the	cotton	is	high	♫	♫	oh	,	your	 d 	 addy 	 	's	rich	and	your	ma	is	good	-	looking	♫	♫	so	hush	little	baby	♫	♫	do	n't	you	cry	♫	and	i	 open 	 ed 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	i	saw	that	she	had	her	 eye 	 s 	 	closed	.
and	after	a	moment	,	she	 open 	 ed 	 	her	 eye 	 s 	 	and	she	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	like	 medit 	 ation 	 	.	``
and	in	that	moment	i	 under 	 stood 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	i	had	gone	to	thailand	to	look	for	,	to	search	for	,	i	had	it	 al 	 ready 	 	in	my	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	--	the	calm	,	but	 alert 	 ness 	 	,	the	focus	,	but	 aware 	 ness 	 	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	in	the	moment	.
when	you	're	 total 	 ly 	 	in	the	moment	,	when	i	'm	 total 	 ly 	 	in	the	moment	,	the	vessel	of	 express 	 ion 	 	is	open	.
the	 emotion 	 s 	 	can	flow	from	me	to	you	and	back	.
 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	experience	.
there	's	a	piece	by	a	 compose 	 r 	 	,	an	american	 compose 	 r 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	john	cage	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	aria	.	``
it	was	written	for	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	cathy	berberian	.
and	the	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	piece	that	's	so	special	--	if	you	see	it	 be 	 hind 	 	me	--	it	's	not	 not 	 ated 	 	in	any	way	.
no	 note 	 s 	 	,	no	 flat 	 s 	 	,	no	 sharp 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	a	kind	of	structure	,	and	the	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	structure	 ha 	 s 	 	total	 free 	 dom 	 	to	be	creative	,	 spontane 	 ous 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	are	different	 color 	 s 	 	and	each	color	 get 	 s 	 	a	different	type	of	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	--	pop	,	country	and	western	,	opera	,	jazz	--	and	you	just	have	to	be	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	that	color	.
you	see	there	are	different	lines	:	you	 choos 	 e 	 	in	your	own	tempo	in	your	own	way	to	follow	the	line	,	but	you	must	respect	it	,	more	or	less	.
and	these	little	 dot 	 s 	 	,	these	represent	a	sort	of	sound	that	's	not	a	vocal	,	not	a	 lyric 	 al 	 	way	of	 express 	 ing 	 	the	voice	.
using	the	body	--	it	could	be	 sneez 	 ing 	 	,	it	could	be	 cough 	 ing 	 	,	it	could	be	 animal 	 s 	 	--	 exact 	 ly 	 	--	 clap 	 ping 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	there	's	different	text	.
there	's	armenian	,	russian	,	french	,	english	,	italian	.
so	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	structure	one	is	free	.
to	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	piece	is	an	 o 	 de 	 	to	the	voice	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 myster 	 ious 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	see	--	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 spontane 	 ous 	 	,	and	it	's	 prim 	 al 	 	.
so	i	would	like	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	piece	with	you	.
it	's	``	aria	``	of	john	cage	.
