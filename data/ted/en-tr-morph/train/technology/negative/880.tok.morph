 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	may	remember	me	from	tedglobal	remember	me	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	few	 question 	 s 	 	which	still	 pre 	 occupy 	 	me	.
one	of	them	was	:	why	is	it	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	six	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	the	eurostar	train	when	,	for	about	10	percent	of	that	money	,	you	could	have	top	 super 	 model 	 s 	 	,	male	and	female	,	 serv 	 ing 	 	free	 chat 	 eau 	 	petrus	to	all	the	 passenger 	 s 	 	for	the	entire	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	the	journey	?
you	'd	still	have	five	billion	left	in	change	,	and	people	would	ask	for	the	 train 	 s 	 	to	be	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	.
now	,	you	may	remember	me	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	question	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	strange	little	 sign 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	flash	``	35	``	at	you	,	 occasion 	 ally 	 	 ac 	 company 	 ing 	 	a	little	smiley	face	or	a	frown	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	 with 	 in 	 	or	 out 	 side 	 	the	speed	limit	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	effective	at	 prevent 	 ing 	 	road	 accident 	 s 	 	than	speed	 camera 	 s 	 	,	which	come	with	the	actual	threat	of	real	 punish 	 ment 	 	.
so	there	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	a	strange	 dis 	 proportion 	 ality 	 	at	work	,	i	think	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	human	problem	solving	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	which	involve	human	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	which	is	:	the	 tend 	 ency 	 	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	or	the	institution	is	to	deploy	 a 	 s 	 	much	force	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 com 	 pulsion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 tend 	 ency 	 	of	the	person	is	to	be	 al 	 most 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	in	absolute	reverse	proportion	to	the	amount	of	force	 be 	 ing 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	.
so	there	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	a	complete	 dis 	 connect 	 	here	.
so	what	i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	is	the	creation	of	a	new	job	title	--	i	'll	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	a	little	 lat 	 er 	 	--	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 add 	 ition 	 	of	a	new	word	 in 	 to 	 	the	english	language	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	seem	to	me	that	large	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	government	,	which	is	,	of	course	,	the	largest	 organ 	 ization 	 	of	all	,	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	to	people	.
let	me	give	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	may	remember	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	aol	-	time	warner	 merge 	 r 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 herald 	 ed 	 	at	the	time	 a 	 s 	 	the	largest	single	deal	of	all	time	.

now	,	all	of	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	in	one	form	or	other	,	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	of	one	or	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	 merge 	 d 	 	.
just	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	did	 any 	 body 	 	notice	 any 	 thing 	 	different	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	at	all	?

by	contrast	,	 year 	 s 	 	of	 market 	 ing 	 	have	taught	me	that	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	people	to	remember	you	and	to	appreciate	what	you	do	,	the	most	potent	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	virgin	atlantic	upper	-	class	,	it	's	the	cruet	salt	and	pepper	set	.
 quit 	 e 	 	nice	in	 it 	 self 	 	,	they	're	little	,	sort	of	,	 air 	 plane 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	sweet	is	every	single	person	looking	at	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 mis 	 ch 	 iev 	 ous 	 	thought	,	which	is	,	``	i	reckon	i	can	 he 	 ist 	 	these	.	``
 how 	 ever 	 	,	you	pick	them	up	and	 under 	 neath 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 engrav 	 ed 	 	in	the	metal	,	are	the	 word 	 s 	 	,	``	 stole 	 n 	 	from	virgin	atlantic	airways	upper	-	class	.	``
now	,	 year 	 s 	 	after	you	remember	the	 strat 	 egic 	 	question	of	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	a	777	or	an	airbus	,	you	remember	 t 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	and	that	experience	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	hotel	in	stockholm	,	the	lydmar	.
 ha 	 s 	 	 any 	 body 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	there	?
it	's	the	lift	,	it	's	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 button 	 s 	 	in	the	lift	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	about	that	at	all	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	these	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	the	 button 	 s 	 	that	take	you	to	an	individual	floor	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	with	 gar 	 age 	 	at	the	bottom	,	i	suppose	,	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	go	up	 gar 	 age 	 	,	grand	floor	,	 m 	 ezza 	 nine 	 	,	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 say 	 s 	 	 gar 	 age 	 	,	funk	,	rhythm	and	 blue 	 s 	 	.
you	have	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 button 	 s 	 	.	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	your	lift	music	.
my	guess	is	that	the	cost	of	 install 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	lift	in	the	lydmar	hotel	in	stockholm	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	500	to	1,000	 pound 	 s 	 	max	.
it	's	 frank 	 ly 	 	more	 memor 	 able 	 	than	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 hotel 	 s 	 	we	've	all	 stay 	 ed 	 	at	that	tell	you	that	your	room	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 renovate 	 d 	 	at	a	cost	of	500,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	in	order	to	make	it	resemble	every	other	hotel	room	you	've	ever	 stay 	 ed 	 	in	in	the	entire	course	of	your	life	.
now	,	these	are	trivial	 market 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	i	accept	.
but	i	was	at	a	ted	event	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	and	esther	duflo	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	in	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	the	 eradic 	 ation 	 	of	poverty	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	spoke	.
and	she	came	 a 	 cross 	 	a	similar	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 fascinate 	 d 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	,	in	a	business	 con 	 text 	 	or	a	government	 con 	 text 	 	,	would	 simpl 	 y 	 	be	so	trivial	a	solution	 a 	 s 	 	to	seem	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	the	 inocul 	 ation 	 	of	children	by	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	making	it	a	social	event	--	i	think	good	use	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	in	that	,	if	you	turn	up	with	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	other	 mother 	 s 	 	to	have	your	child	 inocul 	 ated 	 	,	your	sense	of	confidence	is	much	 great 	 er 	 	than	if	you	turn	up	 al 	 one 	 	.
but	 second 	 ly 	 	,	to	incentivize	that	 inocul 	 ation 	 	by	giving	a	kilo	of	 lent 	 il 	 s 	 	to	 every 	 body 	 	who	 particip 	 ated 	 	.
it	's	a	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	thing	.
if	you	're	a	senior	person	at	unesco	and	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	so	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	world	poverty	?	``
you	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	confident	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	there	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	've	got	it	 crack 	 ed 	 	;	it	's	the	 lent 	 il 	 s 	 	,	``	are	you	?
our	own	sense	of	self	-	aggrandizement	 feel 	 s 	 	that	big	 import 	 ant 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	need	to	have	big	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	most	of	all	,	expensive	 solution 	 s 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	them	.
and	yet	,	what	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	time	after	time	after	time	is	in	human	 behavior 	 al 	 	and	 behavior 	 al 	 	change	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 dis 	 proportion 	 ality 	 	at	work	,	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	 change 	 s 	 	our	behavior	and	what	 change 	 s 	 	our	attitude	to	 thing 	 s 	 	is	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	 proportion 	 ate 	 	to	the	degree	of	expense	 ent 	 ailed 	 	,	or	the	degree	of	force	that	's	 appli 	 ed 	 	.
but	 every 	 thing 	 	about	 institution 	 s 	 	 make 	 s 	 	them	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	that	 dis 	 proportion 	 ality 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	an	institution	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	person	who	 ha 	 s 	 	the	power	to	solve	the	problem	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	budget	.
and	once	you	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	budget	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	for	expensive	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	it	on	.
what	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 lack 	 ing 	 	is	a	class	of	people	who	have	immense	 amount 	 s 	 	of	power	,	but	no	money	at	all	.
it	's	 t 	 hose 	 	people	i	'd	 quit 	 e 	 	like	to	create	in	the	world	going	forward	.
now	,	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	which	is	what	i	call	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	``	terminal	5	syndrome	,	``	which	is	that	big	,	expensive	 thing 	 s 	 	get	big	,	 high 	 ly 	 	-	intelligent	attention	,	and	they	're	great	,	and	terminal	5	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 magnific 	 ent 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	get	down	to	the	small	detail	,	the	 us 	 ability 	 	,	which	is	the	 sign 	 age 	 	,	which	is	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	.
you	come	out	of	``	 arriv 	 e 	 	``	at	the	 air 	 port 	 	,	and	you	follow	a	big	yellow	sign	that	 say 	 s 	 	``	 train 	 s 	 	``	and	it	's	in	front	of	you	.
so	you	walk	for	 an 	 other 	 	hundred	 yard 	 s 	 	,	 expect 	 ing 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	sign	,	that	might	 court 	 e 	 ously 	 	be	yellow	,	in	front	of	you	and	 say 	 ing 	 	``	 train 	 s 	 	.	``
no	,	no	,	no	,	the	next	one	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	blue	,	to	your	left	,	and	 say 	 s 	 	``	heathrow	express	.	``
i	mean	,	it	could	 al 	 most 	 	be	 ra 	 ther 	 	like	that	scene	from	the	film	``	 air 	 plane 	 	.	``
a	yellow	sign	?	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	they	'll	be	 expect 	 ing 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	world	 increasing 	 ly 	 	--	now	,	all	credit	to	the	british	 air 	 port 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	.
i	spoke	about	 th 	 is 	 	before	,	and	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	person	got	in	touch	with	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	what	can	you	do	?	``
so	i	did	come	up	with	five	 suggest 	 ions 	 	,	which	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 action 	 ing 	 	.
one	of	them	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	logically	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	good	idea	to	have	a	lift	with	no	up	and	down	button	in	it	,	if	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 serve 	 s 	 	two	 floor 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 blood 	 y 	 	 terrify 	 ing 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	when	the	door	 close 	 s 	 	and	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	you	to	do	,	you	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 steppe 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	hammer	film	.
so	these	 question 	 s 	 	...	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	is	the	big	stuff	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	 d 	 one 	 	 magnific 	 ent 	 ly 	 	well	.
but	the	small	stuff	,	what	you	might	call	the	user	 inter 	 face 	 	,	is	 d 	 one 	 	 spectacular 	 ly 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	there	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	a	complete	sort	of	 grid 	 lock 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	solving	these	small	 solution 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	people	who	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	solve	them	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	too	 power 	 ful 	 	and	too	 pre 	 occupied 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	they	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	``	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	``	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	solve	them	.

you	know	,	there	are	 case 	 s 	 	where	you	 s 	 pend 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	money	and	you	accomplish	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	.
and	i	'd	be	wrong	to	dis	that	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
moving	over	,	we	come	,	of	course	,	to	 consult 	 ancy 	 	.
i	thought	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 de 	 cent 	 	of	accenture	to	 d 	 itch 	 	tiger	 wood 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	sort	of	hurried	and	 ha 	 s 	 ty 	 	way	.
i	mean	,	tiger	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 obey 	 ing 	 	the	accenture	model	.
he	 develop 	 ed 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 out 	 sourcing 	 	model	for	sexual	 service 	 s 	 	,	no	 long 	 er 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	a	single	 monopol 	 y 	 	 provide 	 r 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	sourcing	 thing 	 s 	 	 local 	 ly 	 	,	and	of	course	,	the	ability	to	have	between	one	and	three	 girl 	 s 	 	 deliver 	 ed 	 	at	any	time	led	for	better	load	-	 balanc 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	accenture	 sudden 	 ly 	 	found	so	 un 	 attract 	 ive 	 	about	that	,	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	.
then	there	are	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	cost	much	and	 achiev 	 e 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 tri 	 via 	 	.
but	there	's	a	fourth	thing	.
and	the	fundamental	problem	is	we	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	word	for	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
we	do	n't	know	what	to	call	it	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	do	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	money	looking	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	looking	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	may	or	may	not	work	,	but	which	,	if	they	do	work	,	can	have	a	success	 absolute 	 ly 	 	out	of	proportion	to	 the 	 ir 	 	expense	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 effort 	 s 	 	and	the	 disrupt 	 ion 	 	they	cause	.
so	the	first	thing	i	'd	like	is	a	 com 	 petition 	 	--	to	 any 	 body 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	film	--	is	to	come	up	with	a	name	for	that	stuff	on	the	bottom	right	.
and	the	second	thing	,	i	think	,	is	that	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	to	have	people	in	charge	of	that	.
that	's	why	i	call	for	the	``	chief	detail	officer	.	``
every	corporation	should	have	one	,	and	every	government	should	have	a	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	detail	.
the	people	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	no	money	,	who	have	no	 extra 	 vag 	 ant 	 	budget	,	but	who	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	you	might	 achiev 	 e 	 	 great 	 er 	 	success	in	 up 	 take 	 	of	a	government	program	by	 actual 	 ly 	 	 doub 	 ling 	 	the	level	of	 benefit 	 s 	 	you	pay	,	but	you	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	same	effect	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	the	form	and	writing	it	in	 comprehens 	 ible 	 	english	.
and	if	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	detail	and	business	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	chief	detail	 officer 	 s 	 	,	then	that	fourth	 quad 	 rant 	 	,	which	is	so	 woe 	 fully 	 	 neglect 	 ed 	 	at	the	moment	,	might	 final 	 ly 	 	get	the	attention	it	 deserve 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
