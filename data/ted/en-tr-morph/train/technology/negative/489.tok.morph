i	do	n't	know	what	the	hell	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	here	.
i	was	born	in	a	scots	presbyterian	ghetto	in	canada	,	and	 drop 	 ped 	 	out	of	high	school	.	i	do	n't	own	a	cell	phone	,	and	i	paint	on	paper	using	 go 	 u 	 ache 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	in	600	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	had	an	art	show	in	new	york	,	and	i	titled	it	``	serious	 non 	 sense 	 	.	``
so	i	think	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	first	one	here	--	i	lead	.
i	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	serious	 non 	 sense 	 	``	 be 	 cause 	 	on	the	serious	side	,	i	use	a	 techni 	 que 	 	of	 pain 	 s 	 taking 	 	 real 	 ism 	 	of	 editor 	 ial 	 	 illustr 	 ation 	 	from	when	i	was	a	kid	.	i	 cop 	 ied 	 	it	and	i	never	 un 	 learn 	 ed 	 	it	--	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	style	i	know	.	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	kind	of	 st 	 aid 	 	and	 form 	 al 	 	.
and	 mean 	 while 	 	,	i	use	 non 	 sense 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	scottish	castle	where	people	are	 play 	 ing 	 	golf	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	,	and	the	trick	was	to	bang	the	golf	ball	off	of	 suit 	 s 	 	of	 arm 	 or 	 	--	which	you	ca	n't	see	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	a	 s 	 eries 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 z 	 any 	 	 afternoon 	 s 	 	,	``	which	 be 	 came 	 	a	book	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	home	-	built	rocket	-	 propel 	 led 	 	car	.	that	's	a	1953	henry	j	--	i	'm	a	bug	for	 authentic 	 ity 	 	--	in	a	quiet	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	in	toledo	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 sub 	 mission 	 	for	the	l.a.	museum	of	film	.
you	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	tell	frank	gehry	and	i	come	from	the	same	town	.
my	work	is	so	personal	and	so	strange	that	i	have	to	invent	my	own	 lexic 	 on 	 	for	it	.
and	i	work	a	lot	in	what	i	call	``	 retro 	 fu 	 tur 	 ism 	 	,	``	which	is	looking	back	to	see	how	 yester 	 day 	 	 view 	 ed 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
and	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	wrong	,	 al 	 ways 	 	 hilarious 	 ly 	 	,	 optimist 	 ically 	 	wrong	.
and	the	peak	time	for	that	was	the	30s	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 depress 	 ion 	 	was	so	 dis 	 mal 	 	that	 any 	 thing 	 	to	get	away	from	the	present	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	...
and	technology	was	going	to	carry	us	 a 	 long 	 	.

 auto 	 motive 	 	 retro 	 fu 	 tur 	 ism 	 	is	one	of	my	 special 	 ties 	 	.

and	it	carried	56	people	at	the	speed	of	a	buick	at	an	altitude	you	could	hear	 dog 	 s 	 	bark	,	and	it	cost	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	a	first	-	class	 cab 	 in 	 	on	the	normandie	to	fly	it	.

it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	spanish	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 techno 	 logically 	 	,	of	the	20th	century	,	by	the	way	.
you	 need 	 ed 	 	to	know	that	.

faux	-	nostalgia	,	which	i	'm	sort	of	--	not	,	say	,	famous	for	,	but	i	work	an	awful	lot	in	it	.
it	's	the	 ach 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 sentiment 	 al 	 	 year 	 ning 	 	for	 time 	 s 	 	that	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	once	 s 	 aid 	 	that	nostalgia	is	the	one	 utter 	 ly 	 	most	 use 	 less 	 	human	emotion	--	so	i	think	that	's	a	case	for	serious	play	.

the	 brain 	 less 	 	rich	are	more	 f 	 un 	 	to	make	 f 	 un 	 	of	than	 any 	 body 	 	.	i	do	a	lot	of	that	.
and	 authentic 	 ity 	 	is	a	major	part	of	my	serious	 non 	 sense 	 	.
i	think	it	 add 	 s 	 	a	huge	amount	.
 t 	 hose 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	are	mark	iv	british	 tank 	 s 	 	from	1916	.

people	wrote	in	for	 re 	 print 	 s 	 	of	that	thing	.
urban	 absurd 	 ism 	 	--	that	's	what	the	new	yorker	 re 	 ally 	 	 call 	 s 	 	for	.
i	try	to	make	life	in	new	york	look	even	 weird 	 er 	 	than	it	is	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 cover 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 d 	 one 	 	about	40	of	them	,	and	i	'd	say	30	of	them	are	based	on	that	 con 	 cept 	 	.
i	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	down	7th	 a 	 venue 	 	one	night	at	3	 a.m 	 . 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 team 	 	 pour 	 ing 	 	out	of	the	street	,	and	i	thought	,	``	what	 cause 	 s 	 	that	?	``	and	that	--	who	's	to	say	?
the	temple	of	dendur	at	the	 metro 	 politan 	 	in	new	york	--	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 som 	 ber 	 	place	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	un	-	pc	cover	.	not	in	new	york	.

have	n't	got	around	to	it	yet	but	--	i	may	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	word	side	of	my	brain	.
i	love	the	word	``	eurotrash	.	``
that	's	all	the	eurotrash	coming	through	jfk	 custom 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	new	york	bike	messenger	 meet 	 ing 	 	the	tour	de	france	.
if	you	live	in	new	york	,	you	know	how	the	bike	 messenger 	 s 	 	move	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	fashion	cover	i	've	ever	 d 	 one 	 	.
it	's	the	little	old	 lad 	 y 	 	that	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	shoe	,	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	thing	--	the	title	of	that	was	,	``	there	 go 	 es 	 	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.	``
i	do	n't	know	a	hell	of	a	lot	about	fashion	--	i	was	told	to	do	what	they	call	a	mary	jane	,	and	then	i	got	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	fight	between	the	art	director	and	the	editor	 say 	 ing 	 	:	``	put	a	 s 	 trap 	 	on	it	``	--	``	no	,	do	n't	put	a	 s 	 trap 	 	on	it	``	--	``	put	a	 s 	 trap 	 	on	it	--	``	do	n't	put	a	 s 	 trap 	 	on	it	``	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	obscures	the	logo	and	 look 	 s 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	and	it	's	bad	and	--	i	 final 	 ly 	 	chickened	out	and	did	it	for	the	sake	of	the	 authentic 	 ity 	 	of	the	shoe	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 tin 	 y 	 	joke	--	e-zr	pass	.	one	letter	 make 	 s 	 	an	idea	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	joke	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	audition	for	``	king	kong	.	``
people	 al 	 ways 	 	ask	me	,	where	do	you	get	your	 idea 	 s 	 	,	how	do	your	 idea 	 s 	 	come	?
truth	about	that	one	is	i	had	a	 horr 	 ible 	 	red	wine	 hang 	 over 	 	,	in	the	middle	of	the	night	,	 th 	 is 	 	came	to	me	like	a	xerox	--	all	i	had	to	do	was	write	it	down	.
it	was	 perfect 	 ly 	 	clear	.	i	did	n't	do	any	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
and	then	when	it	ran	,	a	 love 	 ly 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	,	an	old	 lad 	 y 	 	named	mrs.	edgar	rosenberg	--	if	you	know	that	name	--	 call 	 ed 	 	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	she	 love 	 d 	 	the	cover	,	it	was	so	sweet	.
her	 form 	 er 	 	name	was	fay	wray	,	and	so	that	was	--	i	did	n't	have	the	wit	to	say	,	``	take	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	.	``
 final 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	three	-	page	cover	,	never	 d 	 one 	 	before	,	and	i	do	n't	think	it	will	ever	be	 d 	 one 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	--	 success 	 ive 	 	 page 	 s 	 	in	the	front	of	the	magazine	.
it	's	the	 a 	 s 	 cent 	 	of	man	using	an	 escal 	 ator 	 	,	and	it	's	in	three	 part 	 s 	 	.
you	ca	n't	see	it	all	together	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	but	if	you	look	at	it	 en 	 ough 	 	,	you	can	sort	of	start	to	see	how	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	move	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	elegant	.	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	a	crash	to	end	a	joke	.	that	 complete 	 s 	 	my	oeuvre	.
