the	key	question	is	,	``	when	are	we	going	to	get	fusion	?	``
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	long	time	since	we	've	known	about	fusion	.
we	've	known	about	fusion	since	1920	,	when	 s 	 ir 	 	arthur	stanley	eddington	and	the	british	 associ 	 ation 	 	for	the	 advance 	 ment 	 	of	science	 conjecture 	 d 	 	that	that	's	why	the	 s 	 un 	 	 shine 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	resource	.
i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	when	my	mother	 g 	 ave 	 	me	food	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 sort 	 ed 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	i	 dis 	 like 	 d 	 	from	the	 one 	 s 	 	i	 like 	 d 	 	.
and	i	ate	the	 dis 	 like 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	first	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	you	like	,	you	want	to	 s 	 ave 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	you	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	resource	.
and	once	it	was	sort	of	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	me	how	fast	we	 we 	 re 	 	using	up	the	world	's	 resource 	 s 	 	,	i	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	,	about	 a 	 s 	 	 up 	 set 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	when	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	earth	will	 on 	 ly 	 	last	about	five	billion	 year 	 s 	 	before	it	's	 swallow 	 ed 	 	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
big	 event 	 s 	 	in	my	life	,	a	strange	child	.
energy	,	at	the	moment	,	is	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	resource	.
the	 count 	 ries 	 	that	make	a	lot	of	money	out	of	energy	have	 some 	 thing 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	them	.
coal	-	powered	industrial	revolution	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	--	oil	,	gas	,	sorry	.
gas	,	i	'm	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 enjoy 	 s 	 	it	when	 mis 	 ter 	 	putin	 turn 	 s 	 	off	the	gas	tap	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	budget	 go 	 es 	 	up	.
we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 dominate 	 d 	 	now	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	using	up	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	try	to	lift	 billion 	 s 	 	of	people	out	of	poverty	in	the	third	world	,	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	we	're	using	energy	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	are	going	away	.
and	the	way	we	'll	make	energy	in	the	future	is	not	from	resource	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	from	knowledge	.
if	you	look	50	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,	the	way	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	will	be	making	energy	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	these	three	,	with	some	wind	,	with	some	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	these	are	going	to	be	the	base	load	energy	 driver 	 s 	 	.
solar	can	do	it	,	and	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	have	to	develop	solar	.
but	we	have	a	lot	of	knowledge	to	gain	before	we	can	make	solar	the	base	load	energy	supply	for	the	world	.
 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	.
our	government	is	going	to	put	in	six	new	nuclear	power	 station 	 s 	 	.
they	're	going	to	put	in	six	new	nuclear	power	 station 	 s 	 	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	more	after	that	.
 chin 	 a 	 	is	building	nuclear	power	 station 	 s 	 	.	 every 	 body 	 	is	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	know	that	that	is	one	 s 	 ure 	 	way	to	do	carbon	-	free	energy	.
but	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	what	the	perfect	energy	source	is	,	the	perfect	energy	source	is	one	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	up	much	space	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 exhaust 	 ible 	 	supply	,	is	safe	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	put	any	carbon	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	any	long	-	lived	 radio 	 active 	 	waste	:	it	's	fusion	.
but	there	is	a	catch	.	of	course	there	is	 al 	 ways 	 	a	catch	in	these	 case 	 s 	 	.
fusion	is	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	do	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	for	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	what	is	fusion	?	here	 come 	 s 	 	the	nuclear	physics	.
and	sorry	about	that	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 turn 	 s 	 	me	on	.
i	was	a	strange	child	.
nuclear	energy	 come 	 s 	 	for	a	simple	reason	.
the	most	 s 	 table 	 	nucleus	is	iron	,	right	in	the	middle	of	the	 period 	 ic 	 	table	.
it	's	a	medium	-	sized	nucleus	.
and	you	want	to	go	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	iron	if	you	want	to	get	energy	.
so	,	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	big	,	 want 	 s 	 	to	split	.
but	small	 atom 	 s 	 	want	to	join	together	,	small	nuclei	want	to	join	together	to	make	 big 	 ger 	 	 one 	 s 	 	to	go	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	iron	.
and	you	can	get	energy	out	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 star 	 s 	 	do	.
in	the	middle	of	 star 	 s 	 	,	you	're	 join 	 ing 	 	hydrogen	together	to	make	 hel 	 ium 	 	and	then	 hel 	 ium 	 	together	to	make	carbon	,	to	make	oxygen	,	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	're	made	of	are	made	in	the	middle	of	 star 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	a	hard	process	to	do	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	the	middle	of	a	star	is	 quit 	 e 	 	hot	,	 al 	 most 	 	by	definition	.
and	there	is	one	 re 	 action 	 	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	fusion	 re 	 action 	 	to	do	.
it	's	between	two	 isotope 	 s 	 	of	hydrogen	,	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	hydrogen	:	 deute 	 rium 	 	,	which	is	heavy	hydrogen	,	which	you	can	get	from	 sea 	 water 	 	,	and	 tri 	 t 	 ium 	 	which	is	super	-	heavy	hydrogen	.
these	two	nuclei	,	when	they	're	far	 a 	 part 	 	,	are	charged	.
and	you	push	them	together	and	they	repel	.
but	when	you	get	them	close	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	strong	force	 start 	 s 	 	to	act	and	 pull 	 s 	 	them	together	.
so	,	most	of	the	time	they	repel	.
you	get	them	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	and	then	at	some	point	the	strong	force	 grip 	 s 	 	them	together	.
for	a	moment	they	 be 	 come 	 	 hel 	 ium 	 	5	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	got	five	 particle 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	them	.
so	,	that	's	that	process	there	.	 deute 	 rium 	 	and	 tri 	 t 	 ium 	 	 go 	 es 	 	together	 make 	 s 	 	 hel 	 ium 	 	5	.
 hel 	 ium 	 	 split 	 s 	 	out	,	and	a	neutron	 come 	 s 	 	out	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	energy	 come 	 s 	 	out	.
if	you	can	get	 some 	 thing 	 	to	about	150	million	 degree 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	will	be	 rat 	 tl 	 ing 	 	around	so	fast	that	every	time	they	collide	in	just	the	right	 configu 	 ration 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	happen	,	and	it	will	 re 	 lease 	 	energy	.
and	that	energy	is	what	 power 	 s 	 	fusion	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 action 	 	that	we	want	to	do	.
there	is	one	 trick 	 iness 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 action 	 	.
well	,	there	is	a	 trick 	 iness 	 	that	you	have	to	make	it	150	million	 degree 	 s 	 	,	but	there	is	a	 trick 	 iness 	 	about	the	 re 	 action 	 	yet	.
it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	hot	.
the	 trick 	 iness 	 	about	the	 re 	 action 	 	is	that	 tri 	 t 	 ium 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	in	nature	.
you	have	to	make	it	from	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	you	make	if	from	 lith 	 ium 	 	.	that	 re 	 action 	 	at	the	bottom	,	that	's	 lith 	 ium 	 	6	,	plus	a	neutron	,	will	give	you	more	 hel 	 ium 	 	,	plus	 tri 	 t 	 ium 	 	.
and	that	's	the	way	you	make	your	 tri 	 t 	 ium 	 	.
but	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	fusion	 re 	 action 	 	,	you	've	got	a	neutron	,	so	you	can	make	that	happen	.
now	,	why	the	hell	would	we	 both 	 er 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	why	we	would	 both 	 er 	 	to	do	it	.
if	you	just	plot	how	much	fuel	we	've	got	left	,	in	 unit 	 s 	 	of	present	world	consumption	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	 a 	 cross 	 	there	you	see	a	few	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	oil	--	the	blue	line	,	by	the	way	,	is	the	 low 	 est 	 	estimate	of	 exist 	 ing 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	the	yellow	line	is	the	most	 optimist 	 ic 	 	estimate	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	 a 	 cross 	 	there	you	will	see	that	we	've	got	a	few	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	of	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	left	.
and	god	 know 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	burn	all	of	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	make	an	awful	lot	of	carbon	in	the	air	.
and	then	we	get	to	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	.
and	with	current	reactor	technology	we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	have	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	.
and	we	will	have	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	from	sea	water	,	which	is	the	yellow	line	,	to	make	 convention 	 al 	 	nuclear	power	 station 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bit	 shock 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	fact	our	government	is	 re 	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	that	for	us	to	meet	kyoto	,	and	do	all	 t 	 hose 	 	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
to	go	any	further	you	would	have	to	have	 breed 	 er 	 	technology	.
and	 breed 	 er 	 	technology	is	fast	 breed 	 ers 	 	.	and	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
the	big	thing	,	on	the	right	,	is	the	 lith 	 ium 	 	we	have	in	the	world	.
and	 lith 	 ium 	 	is	in	sea	water	.	that	's	the	yellow	line	.
and	we	have	30	million	 year 	 s 	 	worth	of	fusion	fuel	in	sea	water	.
 every 	 body 	 	can	get	it	.	that	's	why	we	want	to	do	fusion	.
is	it	cost	-	competitive	?
we	make	 estimate 	 s 	 	of	what	we	think	it	would	cost	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	a	fusion	power	plant	.
and	we	get	 with 	 in 	 	about	the	same	price	 a 	 s 	 	current	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
so	,	how	would	we	make	it	?
we	have	to	hold	 some 	 thing 	 	at	150	million	 degree 	 s 	 	.
and	,	in	fact	,	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	hold	it	with	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	.
and	 in 	 side 	 	it	,	right	in	the	middle	of	 th 	 is 	 	toroidal	shape	,	 dough 	 nut 	 	shape	,	right	in	the	middle	is	150	million	 degree 	 s 	 	.
it	 boil 	 s 	 	away	in	the	middle	at	150	million	 degree 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	we	can	make	fusion	happen	.
and	just	down	the	road	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	jet	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	machine	in	the	world	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	fusion	.
when	people	say	fusion	is	30	 year 	 s 	 	away	,	and	 al 	 ways 	 	will	be	,	i	say	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	it	.	``	right	?
we	can	do	fusion	.	in	the	center	of	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	we	made	16	 megawatt 	 s 	 	of	fusion	power	in	1997	.
and	in	2013	we	're	going	to	fire	it	up	 aga 	 in 	 	and	break	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 record 	 s 	 	.
but	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	fusion	power	.	that	's	just	making	some	fusion	happen	.
we	've	got	to	take	that	,	we	've	got	to	make	that	 in 	 to 	 	a	fusion	reactor	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	30	million	 year 	 s 	 	worth	of	fusion	power	for	the	earth	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 de 	 vice 	 	we	're	building	now	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	research	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	you	ca	n't	do	fusion	on	a	table	top	 de 	 spite 	 	all	that	cold	fusion	 non 	 sense 	 	.	right	?
you	ca	n't	.	you	have	to	do	it	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 de 	 vice 	 	.
more	than	half	the	world	's	population	is	 involve 	 d 	 	in	building	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	in	southern	france	,	which	is	a	nice	place	to	put	an	experiment	.
seven	 nation 	 s 	 	are	 involve 	 d 	 	in	building	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	going	to	cost	us	10	billion	.	and	we	'll	produce	half	a	gigawatt	of	fusion	power	.
but	that	's	not	 electric 	 ity 	 	yet	.
we	have	to	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	have	to	get	to	a	power	plant	.
we	have	to	start	 put 	 ting 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	on	the	grid	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	technology	.
and	i	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	like	it	to	happen	a	lot	 fast 	 er 	 	than	it	is	.
but	at	the	moment	,	all	we	can	imagine	is	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	2030s	.
i	wish	 th 	 is 	 	 we 	 re 	 	different	.	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	it	now	.
we	're	going	to	have	a	problem	with	power	in	the	next	five	 year 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
so	2030	 look 	 s 	 	like	an	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	away	.
but	we	ca	n't	abandon	it	now	;	we	have	to	push	forward	,	get	fusion	to	happen	.
i	wish	we	had	more	money	,	i	wish	we	had	more	 resource 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 aim 	 ing 	 	at	,	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	2030s	--	real	electric	power	from	fusion	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
