i	need	to	make	a	 confess 	 ion 	 	at	the	 out 	 set 	 	here	.
a	little	over	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	did	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	regret	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	'm	not	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	proud	of	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	i	wish	no	one	would	ever	know	,	but	here	i	feel	kind	of	 oblig 	 ed 	 	to	reveal	.
in	the	late	1980s	,	in	a	moment	of	 youth 	 ful 	 	 in 	 dis 	 cre 	 tion 	 	,	i	went	to	law	school	.
now	,	in	america	law	is	a	professional	degree	:	you	get	your	university	degree	,	then	you	go	on	to	law	school	.
and	when	i	got	to	law	school	,	i	did	n't	do	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
to	put	it	 mild 	 ly 	 	,	i	did	n't	do	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
i	,	in	fact	,	 graduate 	 d 	 	in	the	part	of	my	law	school	class	that	made	the	top	90	percent	possible	.
thank	you	.
i	never	 practice 	 d 	 	law	a	day	in	my	life	;	i	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	was	n't	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	against	my	better	judgment	,	against	the	 ad 	 vice 	 	of	my	own	wife	,	i	want	to	try	to	dust	off	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	legal	 skill 	 s 	 	--	what	's	left	of	 t 	 hose 	 	legal	 skill 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	to	tell	you	a	story	.
i	want	to	make	a	case	.
i	want	to	make	a	hard	-	headed	,	evidence	-	based	,	 da 	 re 	 	i	say	 lawyer 	 ly 	 	case	,	for	 re 	 think 	 ing 	 	how	we	run	our	 business 	 es 	 	.
so	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	of	the	jury	,	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	candle	problem	.
some	of	you	might	have	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	.
it	's	 create 	 d 	 	in	1945	by	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	named	karl	duncker	.
karl	duncker	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	that	is	used	in	a	whole	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	 behavior 	 al 	 	science	.
and	here	's	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.	suppose	i	'm	the	 experiment 	 er 	 	.
i	 br 	 ing 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	a	room	.	i	give	you	a	candle	,	some	 thumb 	 tack 	 s 	 	and	some	 match 	 es 	 	.
and	i	say	to	you	,	``	your	job	is	to	attach	the	candle	to	the	wall	so	the	wax	 do 	 es 	 	n't	drip	onto	the	table	.	``	now	what	would	you	do	?
now	 man 	 y 	 	people	begin	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 thumb 	 tack 	 	the	candle	to	the	wall	.
 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
 some 	 body 	 	,	some	people	--	and	i	saw	 some 	 body 	 	kind	of	make	the	motion	over	here	--	some	people	have	a	great	idea	where	they	light	the	match	,	melt	the	side	of	the	candle	,	try	to	adhere	it	to	the	wall	.
it	's	an	awesome	idea	.	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	after	five	or	10	 minute 	 s 	 	,	most	people	figure	out	the	solution	,	which	you	can	see	here	.
the	key	is	to	 over 	 come 	 	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	functional	 fix 	 ed 	 ness 	 	.
you	look	at	that	box	and	you	see	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	receptacle	for	the	 tack 	 s 	 	.
but	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	other	function	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	platform	for	the	candle	.	the	candle	problem	.
now	i	want	to	tell	you	about	an	experiment	using	the	candle	problem	,	 d 	 one 	 	by	a	scientist	named	sam	glucksberg	,	who	is	now	at	princeton	university	in	the	u.s	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	power	of	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
here	's	what	he	did	.	he	 gather 	 ed 	 	his	 particip 	 ants 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	time	you	.	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	you	can	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	?	``
to	one	group	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	time	you	to	establish	 norm 	 s 	 	,	 average 	 s 	 	for	how	long	it	 typical 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	problem	.	``
to	the	second	group	he	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	 reward 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	're	in	the	top	25	percent	of	the	 fast 	 est 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	you	get	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	the	 fast 	 est 	 	of	 every 	 one 	 	we	're	 test 	 ing 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	get	20	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	``
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	 adjust 	 ed 	 	for	 infla 	 tion 	 	,	it	's	a	 de 	 cent 	 	sum	of	money	for	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	of	work	.
it	's	a	nice	 motiv 	 ator 	 	.
question	:	how	much	 fast 	 er 	 	did	 th 	 is 	 	group	solve	the	problem	?
answer	:	it	took	them	,	on	average	,	three	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	.
three	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	.	now	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	no	sense	right	?
i	mean	,	i	'm	an	american	.	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	free	 market 	 s 	 	.
that	's	not	how	it	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	work	.	right	?
if	you	want	people	to	perform	better	,	you	reward	them	.	right	?
 bon 	 uses 	 	,	 commission 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 re 	 ality 	 	show	.
incentivize	them	.	that	's	how	business	 work 	 s 	 	.
but	that	's	not	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.
you	've	got	an	incentive	designed	to	 sharp 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 accele 	 rate 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	just	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
it	 dull 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 block 	 s 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	is	that	it	's	not	an	 ab 	 er 	 ration 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 replicate 	 d 	 	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	for	 near 	 ly 	 	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
these	 con 	 ting 	 ent 	 	 motiv 	 ators 	 	--	if	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	then	you	get	that	--	work	in	some	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
but	for	a	lot	of	 task 	 s 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	either	do	n't	work	or	,	often	,	they	do	harm	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 ro 	 bust 	 	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	social	science	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	one	of	the	most	 ignor 	 ed 	 	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	looking	at	the	science	of	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	of	 extr 	 in 	 s 	 ic 	 	 motiv 	 ators 	 	and	intrinsic	 motiv 	 ators 	 	.
and	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	it	's	not	even	close	.
if	you	look	at	the	science	,	there	is	a	 mis 	 match 	 	between	what	science	 know 	 s 	 	and	what	business	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	what	's	 alarm 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	our	business	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	--	think	of	the	set	of	 assumption 	 s 	 	and	 proto 	 col 	 s 	 	 be 	 neath 	 	our	 business 	 es 	 	,	how	we	 motiv 	 ate 	 	people	,	how	we	 app 	 ly 	 	our	human	 resource 	 s 	 	--	it	's	built	 entire 	 ly 	 	around	these	 extr 	 in 	 s 	 ic 	 	 motiv 	 ators 	 	,	around	 carrot 	 s 	 	and	 stick 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	fine	for	 man 	 y 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	20th	century	 task 	 s 	 	.
but	for	21st	century	 task 	 s 	 	,	that	 mechan 	 istic 	 	,	reward	-	and	-	 punish 	 ment 	 	approach	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	often	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	and	often	 do 	 es 	 	harm	.
let	me	show	you	what	i	mean	.
so	glucksberg	did	 an 	 other 	 	experiment	similar	to	 th 	 is 	 	where	he	 present 	 ed 	 	the	problem	in	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	way	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	up	here	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
attach	the	candle	to	the	wall	so	the	wax	 do 	 es 	 	n't	drip	onto	the	table	.
same	deal	.	you	:	we	're	 tim 	 ing 	 	for	 norm 	 s 	 	.
you	:	we	're	 in 	 cent 	 iv 	 izing 	 	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	?
 th 	 is 	 	time	,	the	 incentivize 	 d 	 	group	 kick 	 ed 	 	the	other	group	's	butt	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	when	the	 tack 	 s 	 	are	out	of	the	box	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	easy	is	n't	it	?
if	-	then	 reward 	 s 	 	work	 re 	 ally 	 	well	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 task 	 s 	 	,	where	there	is	a	simple	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	and	a	clear	destination	to	go	to	.
 reward 	 s 	 	,	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	,	narrow	our	focus	,	 concent 	 rate 	 	the	mind	;	that	's	why	they	work	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	for	 task 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	a	narrow	focus	,	where	you	just	see	the	goal	right	there	,	zoom	straight	 a 	 head 	 	to	it	,	they	work	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
but	for	the	real	candle	problem	,	you	do	n't	want	to	be	looking	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	solution	is	not	over	here	.	the	solution	is	on	the	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	.
you	want	to	be	looking	around	.
that	reward	 actual 	 ly 	 	 narrow 	 s 	 	our	focus	and	 restrict 	 s 	 	our	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.
in	western	europe	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	in	north	america	,	in	australia	,	white	-	collar	 work 	 ers 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	less	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	work	,	and	more	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	work	.
that	routine	,	rule	-	based	,	left	-	brain	work	--	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 account 	 ing 	 	,	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	financial	analysis	,	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	computer	 programm 	 ing 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	easy	to	 out 	 source 	 	,	 fair 	 ly 	 	easy	to	 autom 	 ate 	 	.
 soft 	 ware 	 	can	do	it	 fast 	 er 	 	.
low	-	cost	 provide 	 rs 	 	around	the	world	can	do	it	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
so	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	are	the	more	right	-	brained	creative	,	conceptual	 kind 	 s 	 	of	abilities	.
think	about	your	own	work	.
think	about	your	own	work	.
are	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	you	face	,	or	even	the	 problem 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	,	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	--	do	they	have	a	clear	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	,	and	a	single	solution	?	no	.
the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	 mystify 	 ing 	 	.
the	solution	,	if	it	 exist 	 s 	 	at	all	,	is	surprising	and	not	obvious	.
 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	is	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	version	of	the	candle	problem	.
and	for	candle	 problem 	 s 	 	of	any	kind	,	in	any	field	,	 t 	 hose 	 	if	-	then	 reward 	 s 	 	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	around	which	we	've	built	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 business 	 es 	 	,	do	n't	work	.
now	,	i	mean	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	crazy	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	--	here	's	the	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	i	'm	a	lawyer	;	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
i	'm	an	american	;	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fact	--	or	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	say	in	my	 home 	 town 	 	of	washington	,	d.c.	,	a	true	fact	.
let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	i	mean	.
let	me	 marsh 	 al 	 	the	evidence	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	a	story	,	i	'm	making	a	case	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	of	the	jury	,	some	evidence	:	dan	ariely	,	one	of	the	great	 economist 	 s 	 	of	our	time	,	he	and	three	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	did	a	 stud 	 y 	 	of	some	mit	 student 	 s 	 	.
they	 g 	 ave 	 	these	mit	 student 	 s 	 	a	bunch	of	 game 	 s 	 	,	 game 	 s 	 	that	 involve 	 d 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	and	motor	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	 concent 	 ration 	 	.
and	the	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	them	,	for	performance	,	three	 level 	 s 	 	of	 reward 	 s 	 	:	small	reward	,	medium	reward	,	large	reward	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	if	you	do	 re 	 ally 	 	well	you	get	the	large	reward	,	on	down	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	the	task	 involve 	 d 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 mechanic 	 al 	 	skill	 bon 	 uses 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	would	be	 expect 	 ed 	 	:	the	 high 	 er 	 	the	pay	,	the	better	the	performance	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	but	one	the	task	 call 	 ed 	 	for	even	 rud 	 imentary 	 	cognitive	skill	,	a	 large 	 r 	 	reward	led	to	 poor 	 er 	 	performance	.
then	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	let	's	see	if	there	's	any	cultural	bias	here	.
lets	go	to	madurai	,	india	and	test	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
standard	of	living	is	lower	.
in	madurai	,	a	reward	that	is	modest	in	north	american	 standard 	 s 	 	,	is	more	 meaning 	 ful 	 	there	.
same	deal	.	a	bunch	of	 game 	 s 	 	,	three	 level 	 s 	 	of	 reward 	 s 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
people	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	the	medium	level	of	 reward 	 s 	 	did	no	better	than	people	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	the	small	 reward 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	people	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	the	highest	 reward 	 s 	 	,	they	did	the	worst	of	all	.
in	eight	of	the	nine	 task 	 s 	 	we	 examine 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	three	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 high 	 er 	 	 incentive 	 s 	 	led	to	 wo 	 rse 	 	performance	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	some	kind	of	 touch 	 y 	 	-	feely	 social 	 ist 	 	 conspi 	 racy 	 	going	on	here	?
no	.	these	are	 economist 	 s 	 	from	mit	,	from	carnegie	mellon	,	from	the	university	of	chicago	.
and	do	you	know	who	 sponsor 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	research	?
the	federal	 re 	 serve 	 	bank	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	american	experience	.
let	's	go	 a 	 cross 	 	the	pond	to	the	london	school	of	 economic 	 s 	 	--	lse	,	london	school	of	 economic 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 ma 	 	 mat 	 er 	 	of	11	 no 	 bel 	 	 laureate 	 s 	 	in	 economic 	 s 	 	.
training	ground	for	great	economic	 think 	 ers 	 	like	george	soros	,	and	friedrich	hayek	,	and	mick	jagger	.
last	month	,	just	last	month	,	 economist 	 s 	 	at	lse	 look 	 ed 	 	at	51	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	pay	-	for	-	performance	 plan 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 side 	 	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
here	's	what	the	 economist 	 s 	 	there	 s 	 aid 	 	:	``	we	find	that	financial	 incentive 	 s 	 	can	result	in	a	negative	impact	on	 over 	 all 	 	performance	.	``
there	is	a	 mis 	 match 	 	between	what	science	 know 	 s 	 	and	what	business	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	what	 worri 	 es 	 	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	stand	here	in	the	 rub 	 ble 	 	of	the	economic	collapse	,	is	that	too	 man 	 y 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	are	making	 the 	 ir 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 poli 	 cies 	 	about	talent	and	people	,	based	on	 assumption 	 s 	 	that	are	 out 	 d 	 ated 	 	,	 un 	 examine 	 d 	 	,	and	 root 	 ed 	 	more	in	 folk 	 lore 	 	than	in	science	.
and	if	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	economic	mess	,	and	if	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	high	performance	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 definition 	 al 	 	 task 	 s 	 	of	the	21st	century	,	the	solution	is	not	to	do	more	of	the	wrong	 thing 	 s 	 	,	to	 ent 	 ice 	 	people	with	a	 sweet 	 er 	 	carrot	,	or	threaten	them	with	a	 sharp 	 er 	 	stick	.
we	need	a	whole	new	approach	.
and	the	good	news	about	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 motiv 	 ation 	 	have	 give 	 n 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	new	approach	.
it	's	an	approach	built	much	more	around	intrinsic	 motiv 	 ation 	 	.
around	the	 desir 	 e 	 	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	matter	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	like	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	part	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	to	my	mind	,	that	new	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	for	our	 business 	 es 	 	 r 	 evolve 	 s 	 	around	three	 element 	 s 	 	:	 auto 	 nomy 	 	,	 master 	 y 	 	and	purpose	.
 auto 	 nomy 	 	:	the	urge	to	direct	our	own	 live 	 s 	 	.
 master 	 y 	 	:	the	 desir 	 e 	 	to	get	better	and	better	at	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 matter 	 s 	 	.
purpose	:	the	 year 	 ning 	 	to	do	what	we	do	in	the	service	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 large 	 r 	 	than	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
these	are	the	building	 block 	 s 	 	of	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	for	our	 business 	 es 	 	.
i	want	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	about	 auto 	 nomy 	 	.
in	the	20th	century	,	we	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	management	.
management	did	not	emanate	from	nature	.
management	is	like	--	it	's	not	a	tree	,	it	's	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	set	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	 some 	 body 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	it	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	it	's	going	to	work	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
management	is	great	.
 tradition 	 al 	 	 not 	 ions 	 	of	management	are	great	if	you	want	compliance	.

let	me	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	heard	of	the	company	atlassian	?
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	less	than	half	.
atlassian	is	an	australian	 soft 	 ware 	 	company	.
and	they	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	cool	.
a	few	 time 	 s 	 	a	year	they	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	``	go	for	the	next	24	 hour 	 s 	 	and	work	on	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	not	part	of	your	regular	job	.
work	on	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	.	``
so	that	 engineer 	 s 	 	use	 th 	 is 	 	time	to	come	up	with	a	cool	patch	for	code	,	come	up	with	an	elegant	hack	.
then	they	present	all	of	the	stuff	that	they	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 team 	 mate 	 s 	 	,	to	the	rest	of	the	company	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	wild	and	 wool 	 y 	 	all	-	 hand 	 s 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	at	the	end	of	the	day	.
and	then	,	 be 	 ing 	 	australians	,	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	beer	.
they	call	them	fedex	 day 	 s 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	deliver	 some 	 thing 	 	 over 	 night 	 	.
it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	.	it	's	not	bad	.	it	's	a	huge	 trade 	 mark 	 	 viol 	 ation 	 	,	but	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	clever	.
that	one	day	of	 intens 	 e 	 	 auto 	 nomy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	a	whole	array	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	 fix 	 es 	 	that	might	never	have	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	's	 work 	 ed 	 	so	well	that	atlassian	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	it	to	the	next	level	with	20	percent	time	--	 d 	 one 	 	,	 famous 	 ly 	 	,	at	google	--	where	 engineer 	 s 	 	can	work	,	 s 	 pend 	 	20	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 any 	 thing 	 	they	want	.
they	have	 auto 	 nomy 	 	over	 the 	 ir 	 	time	,	 the 	 ir 	 	task	,	 the 	 ir 	 	team	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	radical	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 auto 	 nomy 	 	.
and	at	google	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	,	about	half	of	the	new	 product 	 s 	 	in	a	typical	year	are	 birth 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	20	percent	time	:	 thing 	 s 	 	like	gmail	,	orkut	,	google	news	.
let	me	give	you	an	even	more	radical	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	it	:	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 result 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	work	environment	,	the	rowe	,	 create 	 d 	 	by	two	american	 consult 	 ants 	 	,	in	place	in	place	at	about	a	dozen	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	around	north	america	.
in	a	rowe	people	do	n't	have	 schedule 	 s 	 	.
they	show	up	when	they	want	.
they	do	n't	have	to	be	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	at	a	certain	time	,	or	any	time	.
they	just	have	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	work	 d 	 one 	 	.
how	they	do	it	,	when	they	do	it	,	where	they	do	it	,	is	 total 	 ly 	 	up	to	them	.
 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 environment 	 s 	 	are	 option 	 al 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	,	 product 	 ivity 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	 work 	 er 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	 work 	 er 	 	satisfaction	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	 turn 	 over 	 	 go 	 es 	 	down	.
 auto 	 nomy 	 	,	 master 	 y 	 	and	purpose	,	these	are	the	building	 block 	 s 	 	of	a	new	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	some	of	you	might	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	say	,	``	hmm	,	that	 sound 	 s 	 	nice	,	but	it	's	 utopia 	 n 	 	.	``
and	i	say	,	``	nope	.	i	have	proof	.	``

 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 titan 	 ic 	 	battle	between	these	two	 approach 	 es 	 	.

there	is	a	 mis 	 match 	 	between	what	science	 know 	 s 	 	and	what	business	 do 	 es 	 	.

two	:	 t 	 hose 	 	if	-	then	 reward 	 s 	 	often	destroy	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
three	:	the	secret	to	high	performance	is	n't	 reward 	 s 	 	and	 punish 	 ments 	 	,	but	that	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	intrinsic	drive	--	the	drive	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	sake	.
