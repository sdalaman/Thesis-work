running	--	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	right	,	left	,	right	,	left	--	 yea 	 h 	 	?
i	mean	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	two	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	so	it	's	kind	of	 arrog 	 ant 	 	to	 assum 	 e 	 	that	i	've	got	 some 	 thing 	 	to	say	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	and	 perform 	 ed 	 	better	a	long	time	ago	.
but	the	cool	thing	about	running	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	is	that	 some 	 thing 	 	bizarre	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	activity	all	the	time	.
case	in	point	:	a	couple	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	if	you	saw	the	new	york	city	marathon	,	i	guarantee	you	,	you	saw	 some 	 thing 	 	that	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
an	ethiopian	woman	named	derartu	tulu	 turn 	 s 	 	up	at	the	 start 	 ing 	 	line	.
she	's	37	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	won	a	marathon	of	any	kind	in	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	 previous 	 ly 	 	she	 al 	 most 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	in	 child 	 birth 	 	.
derartu	tulu	was	ready	to	hang	it	up	and	retire	from	the	 s 	 port 	 	,	but	she	 decide 	 d 	 	she	'd	go	for	broke	and	try	for	one	last	big	 pay 	 day 	 	in	the	 mar 	 que 	 e 	 	event	,	the	new	york	city	marathon	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	--	bad	news	for	derartu	tulu	--	some	other	people	had	the	same	idea	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	olympic	gold	 med 	 alist 	 	and	paula	radcliffe	,	who	is	a	 mon 	 ster 	 	,	the	 fast 	 est 	 	woman	 marathon 	 er 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	by	far	.
 on 	 ly 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	off	the	men	's	world	record	,	paula	radcliffe	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	 un 	 beat 	 able 	 	.
that	's	her	 com 	 petition 	 	.
the	gun	 go 	 es 	 	off	,	and	she	's	not	even	an	 under 	 dog 	 	.
she	's	under	the	 under 	 dog 	 s 	 	.
but	the	under	-	 under 	 dog 	 	 hang 	 s 	 	tough	,	and	22	 mile 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	26	-	mile	race	,	there	is	derartu	tulu	up	there	with	the	lead	pack	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	bizarre	 happen 	 s 	 	.
paula	radcliffe	,	the	one	person	who	is	 s 	 ure 	 	to	snatch	the	big	 pay 	 check 	 	out	of	derartu	tulu	's	under	-	 under 	 dog 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 grab 	 s 	 	her	leg	and	 start 	 s 	 	to	fall	back	.
so	we	all	know	what	to	do	in	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	right	?
you	give	her	a	quick	crack	in	the	 tee 	 th 	 	with	your	elbow	and	blaze	for	the	finish	line	.
derartu	tulu	 ruin 	 s 	 	the	script	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	taking	off	,	she	 fall 	 s 	 	back	,	and	she	 grab 	 s 	 	paula	radcliffe	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	come	on	.	come	with	us	.	you	can	do	it	.	``
so	paula	radcliffe	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	.
she	 catch 	 es 	 	up	with	the	lead	pack	and	is	 push 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	finish	line	.
but	then	she	 fall 	 s 	 	back	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	the	second	time	derartu	tulu	 grab 	 s 	 	her	and	tries	to	pull	her	.
and	paula	radcliffe	at	that	point	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	 d 	 one 	 	.	go	.	``
so	that	's	a	fantastic	story	,	and	we	all	know	how	it	 end 	 s 	 	.
she	 lose 	 s 	 	the	check	,	but	she	 go 	 es 	 	home	with	 some 	 thing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	derartu	tulu	 ruin 	 s 	 	the	script	 aga 	 in 	 	--	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	she	 blaze 	 s 	 	past	the	lead	pack	and	 win 	 s 	 	,	 win 	 s 	 	the	new	york	city	marathon	,	 go 	 es 	 	home	with	a	big	fat	check	.
it	's	a	 heart 	 warm 	 ing 	 	story	,	but	if	you	drill	a	little	bit	 deep 	 er 	 	,	you	've	got	to	sort	of	wonder	about	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	was	going	on	there	.
when	you	have	two	 out 	 lier 	 s 	 	in	one	organism	,	it	's	not	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	.
when	you	have	 some 	 one 	 	who	is	more	competitive	and	more	 com 	 passionate 	 	than	 any 	 body 	 	else	in	the	race	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	not	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	.
you	show	me	a	creature	with	 web 	 bed 	 	feet	and	 gill 	 s 	 	;	 some 	 how 	 	water	's	 involve 	 d 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	with	that	kind	of	heart	,	there	's	some	kind	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	there	.
and	the	answer	to	it	,	i	think	,	can	be	found	down	in	the	 cop 	 per 	 	 canyon 	 s 	 	of	mexico	,	where	there	's	a	tribe	,	a	 reclus 	 ive 	 	tribe	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	tarahumara	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	.
now	the	tarahumara	are	 remark 	 able 	 	for	three	 thing 	 s 	 	.
number	one	is	,	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	living	 essential 	 ly 	 	 un 	 change 	 d 	 	for	the	past	400	 year 	 s 	 	.
when	the	 con 	 qui 	 stad 	 ors 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	north	america	you	had	two	 choice 	 s 	 	:	you	either	fight	back	and	engage	or	you	could	take	off	.
the	mayans	and	aztecs	 engag 	 ed 	 	,	which	is	why	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	mayans	and	aztecs	.
the	tarahumara	had	a	different	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
they	took	off	and	hid	in	 th 	 is 	 	 labyrinth 	 ine 	 	,	 network 	 ing 	 	,	 spider 	 web 	 bing 	 	system	of	 canyon 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 cop 	 per 	 	 canyon 	 s 	 	,	and	there	they	 remain 	 ed 	 	since	the	1600s	--	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	they	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
the	second	thing	 remark 	 able 	 	about	the	tarahumara	is	,	deep	 in 	 to 	 	old	age	--	70	to	80	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	n't	running	 marathon 	 s 	 	;	they	're	running	mega	-	 marathon 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	26	 mile 	 s 	 	;	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	100	,	150	 mile 	 s 	 	at	a	time	,	and	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 in 	 jury 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
the	last	thing	that	's	 remark 	 able 	 	about	the	tarahumara	is	that	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 to 	 day 	 	,	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	come	up	with	using	all	of	our	technology	and	brain	power	to	solve	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	heart	disease	and	cholesterol	and	cancer	and	crime	and	 war 	 fare 	 	and	violence	and	 clinic 	 al 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	--	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	the	tarahumara	do	n't	know	what	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
they	are	free	from	all	of	these	modern	 ail 	 ments 	 	.
so	what	's	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	?
 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 out 	 lier 	 s 	 	--	there	's	got	to	be	some	kind	of	cause	and	effect	there	.
well	,	there	are	 team 	 s 	 	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	at	harvard	and	the	university	of	utah	that	are	 bend 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	to	try	to	figure	out	what	the	tarahumara	have	known	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	solve	 t 	 hose 	 	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 myster 	 ies 	 	.
and	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	 myster 	 y 	 	 wrap 	 ped 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	 myster 	 y 	 	--	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	key	to	derartu	tulu	and	the	tarahumara	is	 wrap 	 ped 	 	in	three	other	 myster 	 ies 	 	,	which	go	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	three	 thing 	 s 	 	--	if	you	have	the	answer	,	come	up	and	take	the	 micro 	 phone 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	else	 know 	 s 	 	the	answer	.
and	if	you	know	it	,	then	you	are	 smart 	 er 	 	than	 any 	 body 	 	else	on	planet	earth	.
 myster 	 y 	 	number	one	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	two	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	the	human	brain	 explode 	 d 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	.
australopithecus	had	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	pea	brain	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	 human 	 s 	 	show	up	--	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	--	big	,	old	melon	-	head	.
to	have	a	brain	of	that	 s 	 ize 	 	,	you	need	to	have	a	source	of	 condens 	 ed 	 	caloric	energy	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	early	 human 	 s 	 	are	eating	dead	 animal 	 s 	 	--	no	argument	,	that	's	a	fact	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	problem	is	,	the	first	 ed 	 ged 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	about	200,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	for	 near 	 ly 	 	two	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 kill 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
now	we	're	not	using	our	strength	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 sis 	 s 	 ies 	 	in	the	jungle	.
every	other	animal	is	 strong 	 er 	 	than	we	are	--	they	have	 fang 	 s 	 	,	they	have	 claw 	 s 	 	,	they	have	 nimble 	 ness 	 	,	they	have	speed	.
we	think	usain	bolt	is	fast	.	usain	bolt	can	get	his	ass	 kick 	 ed 	 	by	a	squirrel	.
we	're	not	fast	.
that	would	be	an	olympic	event	:	turn	a	squirrel	loose	--	 who 	 ever 	 	 catch 	 es 	 	the	squirrel	,	you	get	a	gold	 med 	 al 	 	.
so	no	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	no	speed	,	no	strength	,	no	 fang 	 s 	 	,	no	 claw 	 s 	 	--	how	 we 	 re 	 	we	 kill 	 ing 	 	these	 animal 	 s 	 	?	 myster 	 y 	 	number	one	.
 myster 	 y 	 	number	two	:	women	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	olympics	for	 quit 	 e 	 	some	time	now	,	but	one	thing	that	's	 remark 	 able 	 	about	all	women	 s 	 print 	 ers 	 	--	they	all	suck	;	they	're	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
there	's	not	a	fast	woman	on	the	planet	and	there	never	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
the	 fast 	 est 	 	woman	to	ever	run	a	mile	did	it	in	4:15	.
i	could	throw	a	rock	and	hit	a	high	school	boy	who	can	run	 fast 	 er 	 	than	4:15	.
for	some	reason	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	just	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 low 	 	.
but	you	get	to	the	marathon	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	run	the	marathon	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	prior	to	the	1980s	,	medical	science	 s 	 aid 	 	that	if	a	woman	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	run	26	 mile 	 s 	 	--	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 one 	 	know	what	would	happen	if	you	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	run	26	 mile 	 s 	 	,	why	you	 we 	 re 	 	 bann 	 ed 	 	from	the	marathon	before	the	1980s	?
her	uterus	would	be	torn	.
 y 	 es 	 	.	you	would	have	torn	 re 	 productive 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	.
the	uterus	would	fall	out	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	fall	out	of	the	body	.
now	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	a	lot	of	 marathon 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	yet	to	see	any	...
so	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	that	women	have	 be 	 en 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	run	the	marathon	.
in	that	 ver 	 y 	 	short	 learn 	 ing 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	gone	from	broken	 organ 	 s 	 	up	to	the	fact	that	you	're	 on 	 ly 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	off	the	male	world	record	.
then	you	go	beyond	26	 mile 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	distance	that	medical	science	 al 	 so 	 	told	us	would	be	fatal	to	 human 	 s 	 	--	remember	pheidippides	 di 	 ed 	 	when	he	ran	26	 mile 	 s 	 	--	you	get	to	50	and	100	 mile 	 s 	 	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	it	's	a	different	game	.
you	can	take	a	runner	like	ann	trason	,	or	nikki	kimball	,	or	jenn	shelton	,	you	put	them	in	a	race	of	50	or	100	 mile 	 s 	 	against	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	world	and	it	's	a	 co 	 in 	 	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	who	's	going	to	win	.
i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	emily	baer	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	for	a	race	 call 	 ed 	 	the	hardrock	100	,	which	 tell 	 s 	 	you	all	you	need	to	know	about	the	race	.
they	give	you	48	 hour 	 s 	 	to	finish	 th 	 is 	 	race	.
well	emily	baer	--	500	 runner 	 s 	 	--	she	 finish 	 es 	 	in	eighth	place	,	in	the	top	10	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	she	 stop 	 ped 	 	at	all	the	aid	 station 	 s 	 	to	 breast 	 feed 	 	her	baby	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	race	--	and	yet	,	beat	492	other	people	.
so	why	is	it	that	women	get	 strong 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 distance 	 s 	 	get	 long 	 er 	 	?
the	third	 myster 	 y 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	at	the	university	of	utah	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	 finish 	 ing 	 	 time 	 s 	 	for	people	running	the	marathon	.
and	what	they	found	is	that	,	if	you	start	running	the	marathon	at	age	19	,	you	will	get	 progress 	 ively 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	,	year	by	year	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	reach	your	peak	at	age	27	.
and	then	after	that	,	you	succumb	to	the	 rigor 	 s 	 	of	time	.
and	you	'll	get	 s 	 lower 	 	and	 s 	 lower 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	you	're	back	to	running	the	same	speed	you	 we 	 re 	 	at	age	19	.
so	about	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	eight	 year 	 s 	 	to	reach	your	peak	,	and	then	 gradu 	 ally 	 	you	fall	off	your	peak	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	go	back	to	the	 start 	 ing 	 	point	.
you	would	think	it	might	take	eight	 year 	 s 	 	to	go	back	to	the	same	speed	,	 may 	 be 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	--	no	,	it	's	45	 year 	 s 	 	.
64	-	year	-	old	men	and	women	are	running	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	at	age	19	.
now	i	defy	you	to	come	up	with	any	other	physical	activity	--	and	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	say	golf	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	hard	--	where	 geriatric 	 s 	 	are	 perform 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	they	did	 a 	 s 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	.
so	you	have	these	three	 myster 	 ies 	 	.
is	there	one	piece	in	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	which	might	wrap	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	up	?
you	've	got	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	any	time	 some 	 one 	 	 look 	 s 	 	back	in	 pre 	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	tries	to	give	you	some	sort	of	global	answer	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	it	 be 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	you	can	say	 what 	 ever 	 	the	hell	you	want	and	get	away	with	it	.
but	i	'll	submit	 th 	 is 	 	to	you	:	if	you	put	one	piece	in	the	middle	of	 th 	 is 	 	 jig 	 saw 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	it	all	 start 	 s 	 	to	form	a	 cohere 	 nt 	 	picture	.
if	you	wonder	,	why	it	is	the	tarahumara	do	n't	fight	and	do	n't	die	of	heart	disease	,	why	a	poor	ethiopian	woman	named	derartu	tulu	can	be	the	most	 com 	 passionate 	 	and	yet	the	most	competitive	,	and	why	we	 some 	 how 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	find	food	 with 	 out 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	like	to	think	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 master 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	a	pack	of	 hunt 	 ing 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 hunt 	 ing 	 	pack	animal	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	one	advantage	we	have	in	the	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	not	our	 fang 	 s 	 	and	our	 claw 	 s 	 	and	our	speed	--	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	we	do	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	well	is	sweat	.
we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	 be 	 ing 	 	 sweat 	 y 	 	and	 smell 	 y 	 	.
better	than	any	other	mammal	on	earth	,	we	can	sweat	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
but	the	advantage	of	that	little	bit	of	social	 dis 	 comfort 	 	is	the	fact	that	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	running	under	hot	heat	for	long	 distance 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 super 	 b 	 	,	we	're	the	best	on	the	planet	.
you	take	a	horse	on	a	hot	day	,	and	after	about	five	or	six	 mile 	 s 	 	,	that	horse	 ha 	 s 	 	a	choice	.
it	's	either	going	to	breathe	or	it	's	going	to	cool	off	,	but	it	ai	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	both	--	we	can	.
so	what	if	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hunt 	 ing 	 	pack	 animal 	 s 	 	?
what	if	the	 on 	 ly 	 	natural	advantage	we	had	in	the	world	was	the	fact	that	we	could	get	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	group	,	go	out	there	on	that	african	 savanna 	 h 	 	,	pick	out	an	 ant 	 elope 	 	and	go	out	 a 	 s 	 	a	pack	and	run	that	thing	to	death	?
that	's	all	we	could	do	.
we	could	run	 re 	 ally 	 	far	on	a	hot	day	.
well	if	that	's	true	,	a	couple	other	 thing 	 s 	 	had	to	be	true	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	key	to	 be 	 ing 	 	part	of	a	 hunt 	 ing 	 	pack	is	the	word	``	pack	.	``
if	you	go	out	by	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	you	try	to	chase	an	 ant 	 elope 	 	,	i	guarantee	you	there	's	going	to	be	two	 cadaver 	 s 	 	out	there	in	the	 savanna 	 h 	 	.
you	need	a	pack	to	pull	together	.

the	pack	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	able	to	swallow	 it 	 s 	 	ego	,	be	 co 	 operative 	 	and	pull	together	.
what	you	end	up	with	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	is	a	culture	 remark 	 ably 	 	similar	to	the	tarahumara	--	a	tribe	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	 un 	 change 	 d 	 	since	the	stone	age	.
it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	argument	that	 may 	 be 	 	the	tarahumara	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	all	of	us	had	 d 	 one 	 	for	two	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	it	's	us	in	modern	 time 	 s 	 	who	have	sort	of	gone	off	the	path	.
you	know	,	we	look	at	running	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	alien	,	foreign	thing	,	 th 	 is 	 	 punish 	 ment 	 	you	've	got	to	do	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ate	pizza	the	night	before	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	have	taken	 th 	 is 	 	natural	advantage	we	had	and	we	 spoil 	 ed 	 	it	.
how	do	we	spoil	it	?	well	how	do	we	spoil	 any 	 thing 	 	?
we	try	to	cash	in	on	it	.
we	try	to	can	it	and	package	it	and	make	it	``	better	``	and	sell	it	to	people	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	we	 start 	 ed 	 	creating	these	 f 	 ancy 	 	 cushion 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	can	make	running	``	better	,	``	 call 	 ed 	 	running	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	i	get	 personal 	 ly 	 	 piss 	 ed 	 	-	off	about	running	 shoe 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 b 	 ought 	 	a	million	of	them	and	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	hurt	.
and	i	think	that	,	if	 any 	 body 	 	in	here	 run 	 s 	 	--	and	i	just	had	a	conversation	with	carol	;	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	for	two	 minute 	 s 	 	 back 	 stage 	 	,	and	she	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 plant 	 ar 	 	 fasci 	 itis 	 	.
you	talk	to	a	runner	,	i	guarantee	,	 with 	 in 	 	30	 second 	 s 	 	,	the	conversation	 turn 	 s 	 	to	 in 	 jury 	 	.
so	if	 human 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 runner 	 s 	 	,	if	that	's	our	one	natural	advantage	,	why	are	we	so	bad	at	it	?	why	do	we	keep	 get 	 ting 	 	hurt	?
 cur 	 ious 	 	thing	about	running	and	running	 inju 	 ries 	 	is	that	the	running	 in 	 jury 	 	is	new	to	our	time	.
if	you	read	 folk 	 lore 	 	and	 mytho 	 logy 	 	,	any	kind	of	 myth 	 s 	 	,	any	kind	of	tall	 tale 	 s 	 	,	running	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 free 	 dom 	 	and	 vital 	 ity 	 	and	 youth 	 fulness 	 	and	 e 	 ternal 	 	vigor	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	in	our	 life 	 time 	 	that	running	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	fear	and	pain	.
geronimo	used	to	say	that	,	``	my	 on 	 ly 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	are	my	 leg 	 s 	 	.	i	 on 	 ly 	 	trust	my	 leg 	 s 	 	.	``
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	an	apache	triathlon	used	to	be	you	'd	run	50	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	desert	,	engage	in	hand	-	to	-	hand	combat	,	steal	a	bunch	of	 horse 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 lap 	 	leather	for	home	.
geronimo	was	never	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	ah	,	you	know	 some 	 thing 	 	,	my	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	--	i	'm	 taper 	 ing 	 	.	i	got	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	week	off	,	``	or	``	i	need	to	cross	-	train	.
i	did	n't	do	 y 	 oga 	 	.	i	'm	not	ready	.	``
 human 	 s 	 	ran	and	ran	all	the	time	.
we	are	here	 to 	 day 	 	.	we	have	our	digital	technology	.
all	of	our	science	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	fact	that	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	every	day	,	which	was	just	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	naked	feet	and	 leg 	 s 	 	to	run	long	 distance 	 s 	 	.
so	how	do	we	get	back	to	that	 aga 	 in 	 	?
well	,	i	would	submit	to	you	the	first	thing	is	get	rid	of	all	 pack 	 aging 	 	,	all	the	 sale 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 market 	 ing 	 	.
get	rid	of	all	the	 stink 	 ing 	 	running	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
stop	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	urban	 marathon 	 s 	 	,	which	,	if	you	do	four	 hour 	 s 	 	,	you	suck	.
if	you	do	3:59:59	,	you	're	awesome	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 qual 	 ified 	 	for	 an 	 other 	 	race	.
we	need	to	get	back	to	that	sense	of	 play 	 fulness 	 	and	 joy 	 fulness 	 	and	,	i	would	say	,	 naked 	 ness 	 	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	made	the	tarahumara	one	of	the	 health 	 iest 	 	and	 s 	 er 	 ene 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	in	our	time	.
so	what	's	the	benefit	?	so	what	?
so	you	burn	off	the	haagen	-	dazs	from	the	night	before	?
but	 may 	 be 	 	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	benefit	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 with 	 out 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	too	 extrem 	 e 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	imagine	a	world	where	 every 	 body 	 	could	go	out	 the 	 ir 	 	door	and	engage	in	the	kind	of	 exercis 	 e 	 	that	's	going	to	make	them	more	 relax 	 ed 	 	,	more	 s 	 er 	 ene 	 	,	more	 health 	 y 	 	,	burn	off	stress	--	where	you	do	n't	come	back	 in 	 to 	 	your	 off 	 ice 	 	a	 rag 	 ing 	 	maniac	 any 	 more 	 	,	where	you	do	n't	go	back	home	with	a	lot	of	stress	on	top	of	you	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	between	what	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	and	what	the	tarahumara	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
i	do	n't	say	let	's	go	back	to	the	 cop 	 per 	 	 canyon 	 s 	 	and	live	on	corn	and	 ma 	 ize 	 	,	which	is	the	tarahumara	's	 prefer 	 red 	 	diet	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	there	's	 some 	 where 	 	in	between	.
and	if	we	find	that	thing	,	 may 	 be 	 	there	is	a	big	fat	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	out	there	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	 some 	 body 	 	could	find	a	way	to	 re 	 store 	 	that	natural	ability	that	we	all	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	for	most	of	our	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	up	 un 	 til 	 	the	1970s	or	so	,	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	social	and	physical	and	 politic 	 al 	 	and	mental	,	could	be	 astound 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	there	is	a	growing	 sub 	 culture 	 	of	 bare 	 foot 	 	 runner 	 s 	 	,	people	who	got	rid	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
and	what	they	have	found	 uniform 	 ly 	 	is	you	get	rid	of	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	you	get	rid	of	the	stress	,	you	get	rid	of	the	 inju 	 ries 	 	and	the	 ail 	 ments 	 	.
and	what	you	find	is	 some 	 thing 	 	the	tarahumara	have	known	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	a	whole	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
i	've	 experience 	 d 	 	it	 personal 	 ly 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	was	 inju 	 red 	 	all	my	life	,	and	then	in	my	early	40s	i	got	rid	of	my	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	my	running	 ail 	 ments 	 	have	gone	away	too	.
so	 hope 	 fully 	 	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	all	benefit	from	.
and	i	appreciate	you	 guy 	 s 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	story	.	 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
