jean	-	michel	basquiat	,	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	 be 	 cause 	 	[	he	was	]	the	first	black	artist	in	real	time	that	 show 	 ed 	 	me	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	who	and	what	i	was	about	to	enter	 in 	 to 	 	.
my	 over 	 all 	 	project	is	about	art	--	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	about	black	 artist 	 s 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	about	the	way	in	which	art	can	change	the	way	we	think	about	culture	and	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
my	interest	is	in	 artist 	 s 	 	who	understand	and	 re 	 write 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	who	think	about	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	narrative	of	the	 large 	 r 	 	world	of	art	,	but	who	have	 create 	 d 	 	new	 place 	 s 	 	for	us	to	see	and	understand	.
i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	two	 artist 	 s 	 	here	,	glenn	ligon	and	carol	 walk 	 er 	 	,	two	of	 man 	 y 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	form	for	me	the	essential	 question 	 s 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cur 	 ator 	 	to	the	world	.
i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	idea	of	why	and	how	i	could	create	a	new	story	,	a	new	narrative	in	art	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	a	new	narrative	in	the	world	.
and	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	had	to	see	the	way	in	which	 artist 	 s 	 	work	,	understand	the	artist	's	studio	 a 	 s 	 	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	the	museum	 a 	 s 	 	a	think	tank	and	looking	at	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	ultimate	white	paper	--	 ask 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	the	space	to	look	and	to	think	about	 answer 	 s 	 	.
in	1994	,	when	i	was	a	 cur 	 ator 	 	at	the	whitney	museum	,	i	made	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	black	male	.
it	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	race	and	gender	in	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	american	art	.
it	 s 	 ought 	 	to	express	the	ways	in	which	art	could	provide	a	space	for	 dial 	 ogue 	 	--	 complic 	 ated 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	,	 dial 	 ogue 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 point 	 s 	 	of	entry	--	and	how	the	museum	could	be	the	space	for	 th 	 is 	 	contest	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 include 	 d 	 	over	20	 artist 	 s 	 	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	 age 	 s 	 	and	 race 	 s 	 	,	but	all	looking	at	black	 mascu 	 lin 	 ity 	 	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	point	of	view	.
what	was	significant	about	 th 	 is 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	is	the	way	in	which	it	 engag 	 ed 	 	me	in	my	role	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cur 	 ator 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	catalyst	,	for	 th 	 is 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 distinct 	 ly 	 	in	the	course	of	 th 	 is 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	is	i	was	 confront 	 ed 	 	with	idea	of	how	 power 	 ful 	 	 image 	 s 	 	can	be	and	people	's	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	each	other	.
i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	two	 work 	 s 	 	,	one	on	the	right	by	leon	golub	,	one	on	the	left	by	robert	colescott	.
and	in	the	course	of	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	--	which	was	 content 	 ious 	 	,	controversial	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	for	me	,	life	-	changing	in	my	sense	of	what	art	could	be	--	a	woman	came	up	to	me	on	the	 gall 	 ery 	 	floor	to	express	her	concern	about	the	nature	of	how	 power 	 ful 	 	 image 	 s 	 	could	be	and	how	we	 under 	 stood 	 	each	other	.
and	she	 point 	 ed 	 	to	the	work	on	the	left	to	tell	me	how	 problem 	 atic 	 	 th 	 is 	 	image	was	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	related	,	for	her	,	to	the	idea	of	how	black	people	had	 be 	 en 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	.
and	she	 point 	 ed 	 	to	the	image	on	the	right	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	to	me	,	of	the	kind	of	dignity	that	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	 port 	 ray 	 ed 	 	to	work	against	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	in	the	media	.
she	then	 assign 	 ed 	 	these	 work 	 s 	 	racial	 ident 	 ities 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	to	me	that	the	work	on	the	right	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	was	made	by	a	black	artist	,	the	work	on	the	left	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	by	a	white	artist	,	when	,	in	effect	,	that	was	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	case	:	bob	colescott	,	african	-	american	artist	;	leon	golub	,	a	white	artist	.
the	point	of	that	for	me	was	to	say	--	in	that	space	,	in	that	moment	--	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	,	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	,	 want 	 ed 	 	to	understand	how	 image 	 s 	 	could	work	,	how	 image 	 s 	 	did	work	,	and	how	 artist 	 s 	 	 provide 	 d 	 	a	space	 big 	 ger 	 	than	one	that	we	could	imagine	in	our	day	-	to	-	day	 live 	 s 	 	to	work	through	these	 image 	 s 	 	.
fast	-	forward	and	i	end	up	in	harlem	;	home	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	black	america	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	 psych 	 ic 	 	heart	of	the	black	experience	,	 re 	 ally 	 	the	place	where	the	harlem	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
harlem	now	,	sort	of	 explain 	 ing 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 it 	 self 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	century	,	looking	both	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	and	 forward 	 s 	 	...
i	 al 	 ways 	 	say	harlem	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	community	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 un 	 like 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 place 	 s 	 	,	it	 think 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	past	,	present	and	the	future	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	;	no	one	 speak 	 s 	 	of	it	just	in	the	now	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	what	it	was	and	what	it	can	be	.
and	,	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	,	then	my	second	project	,	the	second	question	i	ask	is	:	can	a	museum	be	a	catalyst	in	a	community	?
can	a	museum	house	 artist 	 s 	 	and	allow	them	to	be	change	 agent 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	 re 	 think 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	harlem	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	on	january	20th	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 it 	 self 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	.
so	i	work	now	at	the	studio	museum	in	harlem	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	there	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	discover	art	's	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
now	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	to	some	of	you	?
in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	i	know	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	are	 involve 	 d 	 	in	cross	-	cultural	 dia 	 logues 	 	,	you	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 idea 	 s 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
think	about	the	place	that	 artist 	 s 	 	can	play	in	that	--	that	is	the	kind	of	 incub 	 ation 	 	and	 advoc 	 acy 	 	that	i	work	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	in	 work 	 ing 	 	with	young	,	black	 artist 	 s 	 	.
think	about	 artist 	 s 	 	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	content	 provide 	 rs 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	they	can	be	 brilli 	 ant 	 	at	that	,	but	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	real	 catalyst 	 s 	 	.
the	studio	museum	was	 found 	 ed 	 	in	the	late	60s	.
and	i	 br 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	up	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	locate	 th 	 is 	 	practice	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
to	look	at	1968	,	in	the	 in 	 credible 	 	historic	moment	that	it	is	,	and	think	of	the	arc	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	since	then	,	to	think	of	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	we	are	all	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	stand	in	 to 	 day 	 	and	imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	museum	that	came	out	of	a	moment	of	great	protest	and	one	that	was	so	much	about	 exa 	 min 	 ing 	 	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	 import 	 ant 	 	african	-	american	 artist 	 s 	 	to	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	art	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	like	jacob	lawrence	,	norman	lewis	,	romare	bearden	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	us	to	 to 	 day 	 	.
in	1975	,	muhammad	ali	 g 	 ave 	 	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	at	harvard	university	.
after	his	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	a	student	got	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	``	give	us	a	poem	.	``
and	mohammed	ali	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	me	,	we	.	``
a	 pro 	 found 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	about	the	individual	and	the	community	.
the	space	in	which	now	,	in	my	project	of	 discover 	 y 	 	,	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 artist 	 s 	 	,	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	define	what	might	be	black	art	cultural	 move 	 ment 	 	of	the	21st	century	.
what	that	might	mean	for	cultural	 move 	 ments 	 	all	over	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	the	``	me	,	we	``	 seem 	 s 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pre 	 scient 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	end	,	the	specific	project	that	 ha 	 s 	 	made	 th 	 is 	 	possible	for	me	is	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	,	all	titled	with	an	f	--	 free 	 style 	 	,	frequency	and	flow	--	which	have	set	out	to	discover	the	young	,	black	 artist 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	moment	who	i	feel	 strong 	 ly 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	work	over	the	next	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	was	made	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	try	and	question	the	idea	of	what	it	would	mean	now	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	to	see	art	 a 	 s 	 	a	catalyst	;	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	now	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	define	and	 re 	 define 	 	culture	,	black	culture	 specific 	 ally 	 	in	my	case	,	but	culture	 general 	 ly 	 	.
i	named	 th 	 is 	 	group	of	 artist 	 s 	 	around	an	idea	,	which	i	put	out	there	 call 	 ed 	 	post	-	black	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	to	define	them	 a 	 s 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	who	came	and	start	 the 	 ir 	 	work	now	,	looking	back	at	 histo 	 ry 	 	but	start	in	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	.
it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 discover 	 y 	 	that	i	have	a	new	set	of	 question 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	new	set	of	 question 	 s 	 	is	:	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	,	right	now	,	to	be	african	-	american	in	america	?
what	can	 art 	 work 	 	say	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
where	can	a	museum	exist	 a 	 s 	 	the	place	for	us	all	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	?
 re 	 ally 	 	,	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	energy	and	the	 excit 	 ement 	 	that	young	 artist 	 s 	 	can	 br 	 ing 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 work 	 s 	 	for	me	are	about	,	not	 al 	 ways 	 	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	about	the	aesthetic	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	imagine	,	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 vision 	 s 	 	create	and	put	out	there	in	the	world	,	but	more	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	through	the	 excit 	 ement 	 	of	the	community	that	they	create	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	that	would	allow	us	right	now	to	understand	our	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
i	am	 continu 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	by	the	way	in	which	the	subject	of	race	can	take	 it 	 self 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	imagine	it	should	be	.
i	am	 al 	 ways 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	by	the	way	in	which	 artist 	 s 	 	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	do	that	in	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
it	is	why	i	look	to	art	.
it	's	why	i	ask	 question 	 s 	 	of	art	.
it	is	why	i	make	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	40	young	 artist 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	over	the	course	of	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	for	me	it	's	about	 consider 	 ing 	 	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
it	's	 consider 	 ing 	 	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	generation	 ha 	 s 	 	to	say	to	the	rest	of	us	.
it	's	 consider 	 ing 	 	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	for	these	 artist 	 s 	 	to	be	both	out	in	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	work	 travel 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	people	who	are	 see 	 ing 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	face	us	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	about	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	creative	spirit	and	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	 imagin 	 ing 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	urban	america	,	about	the	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	of	the	spirit	.
now	,	where	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	end	up	right	now	?
for	me	,	it	is	about	re	-	 imagin 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cultural	 dis 	 course 	 	in	an	 inter 	 national 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
so	the	last	iteration	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	flow	,	with	the	idea	now	of	creating	a	real	network	of	 artist 	 s 	 	around	the	world	;	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	,	not	so	much	from	harlem	and	out	,	but	looking	 a 	 cross 	 	,	and	flow	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 artist 	 s 	 	all	born	on	the	continent	of	africa	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	think	about	that	continent	and	think	about	what	if	 mean 	 s 	 	to	us	all	in	the	21st	century	,	i	have	 beg 	 un 	 	that	looking	through	 artist 	 s 	 	,	through	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	,	and	 imagin 	 ing 	 	what	they	can	tell	us	about	the	future	,	what	they	tell	us	about	our	future	,	and	what	they	create	in	 the 	 ir 	 	sense	of	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	great	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 watch 	 ing 	 	that	continent	emerge	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	our	 big 	 ger 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	.
so	,	what	do	i	discover	when	i	look	at	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	?
what	do	i	think	about	when	i	think	about	art	?
i	feel	like	the	privilege	i	've	had	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cur 	 ator 	 	is	not	just	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	new	 work 	 s 	 	,	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	 excit 	 ing 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
but	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	what	i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	about	 my 	 self 	 	and	what	i	can	 off 	 er 	 	in	the	space	of	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	,	to	talk	about	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	to	talk	about	power	,	to	talk	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	to	talk	and	speak	to	each	other	.
that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	me	get	up	every	day	and	want	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	generation	of	black	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 artist 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
thank	you	.
