that	's	the	 poli 	 test 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	i	have	for	them	.

some	of	these	 govern 	 ance 	 	 gap 	 s 	 	are	run	by	 r 	 ogue 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.

but	right	now	,	most	of	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	these	supply	 chain 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	any	way	of	 assur 	 ing 	 	us	that	 no 	 body 	 	had	to	mortgage	 the 	 ir 	 	future	,	 no 	 body 	 	had	to	sacrifice	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	us	our	 favor 	 ite 	 	brand	name	product	.
now	,	i	did	n't	come	here	to	depress	you	about	the	state	of	the	global	supply	chain	.
we	need	a	 re 	 ality 	 	check	.
we	need	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	just	how	serious	a	 defici 	 t 	 	of	 right 	 s 	 	we	have	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	 re 	 public 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	state	.
it	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	not	a	 democrat 	 ic 	 	state	.
and	right	now	,	that	 in 	 dependent 	 	 re 	 public 	 	of	the	supply	chain	is	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 govern 	 ed 	 	in	a	way	that	would	satisfy	us	,	that	we	can	engage	in	 ethic 	 al 	 	trade	or	 ethic 	 al 	 	consumption	.
now	,	that	's	not	a	new	story	.
you	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	 document 	 aries 	 	of	 sweat 	 shop 	 s 	 	making	 gar 	 ments 	 	all	over	the	world	,	even	in	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
you	want	to	see	the	classic	 sweat 	 shop 	 	,	meet	me	at	madison	square	garden	,	i	'll	take	you	down	the	street	,	and	i	'll	show	you	a	chinese	 sweat 	 shop 	 	.
but	take	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 he 	 par 	 in 	 	.
it	's	a	pharmaceutical	product	.
you	expect	that	the	supply	chain	that	 get 	 s 	 	it	to	the	hospital	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 squeak 	 y 	 	clean	.
the	problem	is	that	the	active	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	in	there	--	 a 	 s 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	--	 come 	 s 	 	from	 pig 	 s 	 	.
the	main	american	 manufactur 	 er 	 	of	that	active	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	to	 re 	 locate 	 	to	 chin 	 a 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	world	's	 big 	 gest 	 	 suppli 	 er 	 	of	 pig 	 s 	 	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	--	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	clean	--	is	 get 	 ting 	 	all	of	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	from	 back 	 yard 	 	abattoirs	,	where	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	 s 	 laughter 	 	 pig 	 s 	 	and	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	.
so	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	had	a	scandal	which	 kill 	 ed 	 	about	80	people	around	the	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 contami 	 nant 	 s 	 	that	 cre 	 pt 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 he 	 par 	 in 	 	supply	chain	.
 wo 	 rse 	 	,	some	of	the	 suppli 	 ers 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	they	could	 substitut 	 e 	 	a	product	which	 mimic 	 ked 	 	 he 	 par 	 in 	 	in	 test 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 substitut 	 e 	 	cost	nine	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	pound	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	real	 he 	 par 	 in 	 	,	the	real	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	,	cost	900	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	pound	.
a	no	-	 brain 	 er 	 	.
the	problem	was	that	it	 kill 	 ed 	 	more	people	.
and	so	you	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	how	come	the	u.s.	food	and	drug	 administr 	 ation 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	happen	?
how	did	the	chinese	state	 age 	 ncy 	 	for	food	and	 drug 	 s 	 	allow	 th 	 is 	 	to	happen	?	``
and	the	answer	is	 quit 	 e 	 	simple	:	the	chinese	define	these	 facil 	 ities 	 	 a 	 s 	 	chemical	 facil 	 ities 	 	,	not	pharmaceutical	 facil 	 ities 	 	,	so	they	do	n't	audit	them	.
and	the	usfda	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 jurisdiction 	 al 	 	problem	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 off 	 shore 	 	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	conduct	a	few	 investigation 	 s 	 	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	--	about	a	dozen	a	year	--	 may 	 be 	 	20	in	a	good	year	.
there	are	500	of	these	 facil 	 ities 	 	producing	active	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
in	fact	,	about	80	percent	of	the	active	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	in	 medicine 	 s 	 	now	come	from	 off 	 shore 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	,	and	we	do	n't	have	a	 govern 	 ance 	 	system	.
we	do	n't	have	a	 regulat 	 ory 	 	system	able	to	ensure	that	that	production	is	safe	.
we	do	n't	have	a	system	to	ensure	that	human	 right 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ic 	 	dignity	,	are	 ensure 	 d 	 	.
so	at	a	national	level	--	and	we	work	in	about	60	different	 count 	 ries 	 	--	at	a	national	level	we	've	got	a	serious	 break 	 down 	 	in	the	ability	of	 government 	 s 	 	to	 regulat 	 e 	 	production	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 s 	 oil 	 	.
and	the	real	problem	with	the	global	supply	chain	is	that	it	's	 s 	 up 	 ra 	 national 	 	.
so	 government 	 s 	 	who	are	 fail 	 ing 	 	,	who	are	dropping	the	ball	at	a	national	level	,	have	even	less	ability	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	around	the	problem	at	an	 inter 	 national 	 	level	.
and	you	can	just	look	at	the	 head 	 lines 	 	.
take	copenhagen	last	year	--	complete	failure	of	 government 	 s 	 	to	do	the	right	thing	in	the	face	of	an	 inter 	 national 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
take	the	g	20	 meet 	 ing 	 	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	--	 steppe 	 d 	 	back	from	 it 	 s 	 	 commit 	 ments 	 	of	just	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
you	can	take	any	one	of	the	major	global	 challeng 	 es 	 	we	've	 discuss 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	week	and	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	where	is	the	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	from	 government 	 s 	 	to	step	up	and	come	up	with	 solution 	 s 	 	,	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	?
and	the	simple	answer	is	they	ca	n't	.	they	're	national	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 vot 	 ers 	 	are	local	.
they	have	parochial	 interest 	 s 	 	.
they	ca	n't	subordinate	 t 	 hose 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	to	the	 great 	 er 	 	global	public	good	.
so	,	if	we	're	going	to	ensure	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	the	key	public	 good 	 s 	 	at	an	 inter 	 national 	 	level	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	in	the	global	supply	chain	--	we	have	to	come	up	with	a	different	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
we	need	a	different	machine	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
in	the	1990s	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 scandal 	 s 	 	 concern 	 ing 	 	the	production	of	brand	name	 good 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	--	child	labor	,	 force 	 d 	 	labor	,	serious	health	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	 abuse 	 s 	 	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	clinton	,	in	1996	,	 conven 	 ed 	 	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	at	the	white	house	,	 invit 	 ed 	 	industry	,	human	 right 	 s 	 	ngos	,	trade	 un 	 ions 	 	,	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	labor	,	got	them	all	in	a	room	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	i	do	n't	want	 global 	 ization 	 	to	be	a	race	to	the	bottom	.
i	do	n't	know	how	to	prevent	that	,	but	i	'm	at	 l 	 east 	 	going	to	use	my	good	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	to	get	you	 folk 	 s 	 	together	to	come	up	with	a	 respons 	 e 	 	.	``
so	they	 form 	 ed 	 	a	white	house	task	force	,	and	they	 s 	 pent 	 	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	 argu 	 ing 	 	about	who	 take 	 s 	 	how	much	 respons 	 ibility 	 	in	the	global	supply	chain	.
 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	did	n't	feel	it	was	 the 	 ir 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
they	do	n't	own	 t 	 hose 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
they	do	n't	employ	 t 	 hose 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	.
they	're	not	 legal 	 ly 	 	 li 	 able 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	else	at	the	table	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 folk 	 s 	 	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cut	it	.
you	have	a	 cus 	 to 	 dial 	 	duty	,	a	duty	of	care	,	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	that	product	 get 	 s 	 	from	 where 	 ver 	 	to	the	store	in	a	way	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	 consum 	 e 	 	it	,	 with 	 out 	 	fear	of	our	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	or	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	sacrifice	our	 con 	 science 	 	to	 consum 	 e 	 	that	product	.	``
so	they	 agree 	 d 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	what	we	'll	do	is	we	agree	on	a	common	set	of	 standard 	 s 	 	,	code	of	conduct	.
we	'll	 app 	 ly 	 	that	 through 	 out 	 	our	global	supply	chain	 regard 	 less 	 	of	 owner 	 ship 	 	or	control	.
we	'll	make	it	part	of	the	contract	.	``
and	that	was	a	stroke	of	absolute	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	they	did	was	they	 harness 	 ed 	 	the	power	of	the	contract	,	private	power	,	to	deliver	public	 good 	 s 	 	.
and	let	's	face	it	,	the	contract	from	a	major	 multi 	 national 	 	brand	to	a	 suppli 	 er 	 	in	india	or	 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	much	more	 persuas 	 ive 	 	value	than	the	local	labor	law	,	the	local	 environment 	 al 	 	 regulat 	 ions 	 	,	the	local	human	 right 	 s 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 factor 	 ies 	 	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	never	see	an	 inspect 	 or 	 	.
if	the	 inspect 	 or 	 	did	come	 a 	 long 	 	,	it	would	be	 amaz 	 ing 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	resist	the	bribe	.
even	if	they	did	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 cit 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 viol 	 ations 	 	,	the	fine	would	be	 deris 	 ory 	 	.
but	you	lose	that	contract	for	a	major	brand	name	,	that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 stay 	 ing 	 	in	business	or	going	bankrupt	.
that	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
so	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	is	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	harness	the	power	and	the	influence	of	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	 trans 	 national 	 	institution	in	the	global	supply	chain	,	that	of	the	 multi 	 national 	 	company	,	and	get	them	to	do	the	right	thing	,	get	them	to	use	that	power	for	good	,	to	deliver	the	key	public	 good 	 s 	 	.
now	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	 natural 	 ly 	 	to	 multi 	 national 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	set	up	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	they	're	set	up	to	make	money	.
but	they	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	efficient	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
they	have	 resource 	 s 	 	,	and	if	we	can	add	the	will	,	the	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	they	know	how	to	deliver	that	product	.
now	,	 get 	 ting 	 	there	is	not	easy	.
 t 	 hose 	 	supply	 chain 	 s 	 	i	put	up	on	the	screen	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	they	're	not	there	.
you	need	a	safe	space	.
you	need	a	place	where	people	can	come	together	,	 s 	 it 	 	down	 with 	 out 	 	fear	of	judgment	,	 with 	 out 	 	 recrimi 	 nation 	 	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	face	the	problem	,	agree	on	the	problem	and	come	up	with	 solution 	 s 	 	.
we	can	do	it	.	the	technical	 solution 	 s 	 	are	there	.
the	problem	is	the	lack	of	trust	,	the	lack	of	confidence	,	the	lack	of	 partner 	 ship 	 	between	ngos	,	campaign	 group 	 s 	 	,	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	 multi 	 national 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
if	we	can	put	 t 	 hose 	 	two	together	in	a	safe	space	,	get	them	to	work	together	,	we	can	deliver	public	 good 	 s 	 	right	now	,	or	in	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	short	supply	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	radical	 pro 	 position 	 	,	and	it	's	crazy	to	think	that	if	you	're	a	15	-	year	-	old	bangladeshi	girl	 leav 	 ing 	 	your	 r 	 ural 	 	village	to	go	and	work	in	a	 factor 	 y 	 	in	dhaka	--	22	,	23	,	24	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	--	your	best	chance	of	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	 right 	 s 	 	at	work	is	if	that	 factor 	 y 	 	is	producing	for	a	brand	name	company	which	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	code	of	conduct	and	made	that	code	of	conduct	part	of	the	contract	.
it	's	crazy	.
 multi 	 national 	 s 	 	are	 protect 	 ing 	 	human	 right 	 s 	 	.
i	know	there	's	going	to	be	 dis 	 belief 	 	.
you	'll	say	,	``	how	can	we	trust	them	?	``
well	,	we	do	n't	.
it	's	the	old	 arm 	 s 	 	control	phrase	:	``	trust	,	but	 ver 	 ify 	 	.	``
so	we	audit	.
we	take	 the 	 ir 	 	supply	chain	,	we	take	all	the	 factor 	 y 	 	 name 	 s 	 	,	we	do	a	random	 s 	 ample 	 	,	we	 s 	 end 	 	 inspect 	 ors 	 	on	an	 un 	 announce 	 d 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	to	inspect	 t 	 hose 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	,	and	then	we	publish	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	critical	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	can	call	 your 	 self 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	,	but	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 account 	 ability 	 	often	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
so	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	we	're	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 enlist 	 ing 	 	the	 multi 	 national 	 s 	 	,	we	're	giving	them	the	 tool 	 s 	 	to	deliver	 th 	 is 	 	public	good	--	respect	for	human	 right 	 s 	 	--	and	we	're	 check 	 ing 	 	.
you	do	n't	need	to	 believ 	 e 	 	me	.	you	should	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	.
go	to	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.	look	at	the	audit	 result 	 s 	 	.
ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	company	 behav 	 ing 	 	in	a	 social 	 ly 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	way	?
can	i	buy	that	product	 with 	 out 	 	 com 	 promising 	 	my	 ethic 	 s 	 	?
that	's	the	way	the	system	 work 	 s 	 	.
i	hate	the	idea	that	 government 	 s 	 	are	not	 protect 	 ing 	 	human	 right 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
i	hate	the	idea	that	 government 	 s 	 	have	 drop 	 ped 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ball	and	i	ca	n't	get	used	to	the	idea	that	 some 	 how 	 	we	ca	n't	get	them	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	in	that	time	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	ability	,	the	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	the	will	of	government	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	decline	,	and	i	do	n't	see	them	making	a	 come 	 back 	 	right	now	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 think 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 stop 	 gap 	 	measure	.
we	're	now	 think 	 ing 	 	that	,	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	start	of	a	new	way	of	 regulat 	 ing 	 	and	 address 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
call	it	network	 govern 	 ance 	 	.	call	it	what	you	will	.
the	private	 act 	 ors 	 	,	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	ngos	,	are	going	to	have	to	get	together	to	face	the	major	 challeng 	 es 	 	we	are	going	to	face	.
just	look	at	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	--	 s 	 wine 	 	flu	,	bird	flu	,	h	1n1	.
look	at	the	health	 system 	 s 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
do	they	have	the	 resource 	 s 	 	to	face	up	to	a	serious	 pan 	 demic 	 	?
could	the	private	sector	and	ngos	get	together	and	 marsh 	 al 	 	a	 respons 	 e 	 	?
 absolute 	 ly 	 	.
what	they	lack	is	that	safe	space	to	come	together	,	agree	and	move	to	action	.
that	's	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	provide	.
i	know	 a 	 s 	 	well	that	 th 	 is 	 	often	 seem 	 s 	 	like	an	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	level	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	people	to	 assum 	 e 	 	.
``	you	want	me	to	deliver	human	 right 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	my	global	supply	chain	.
there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 suppli 	 ers 	 	in	there	.	``
it	 seem 	 s 	 	too	 daunt 	 ing 	 	,	too	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	for	any	company	to	take	on	.
but	there	are	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
we	have	4,000	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	who	are	 member 	 s 	 	.
some	of	them	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
the	 s 	 port 	 ing 	 	 good 	 s 	 	industry	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 steppe 	 d 	 	up	to	the	plate	and	have	 d 	 one 	 	it	.
the	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	role	model	,	is	there	.
and	 when 	 ever 	 	we	discuss	one	of	these	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	address	--	child	labor	in	 cotton 	 seed 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	in	india	--	 th 	 is 	 	year	we	will	monitor	50,000	 cotton 	 seed 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	in	india	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	.
the	 number 	 s 	 	just	make	you	want	to	zone	out	.
but	we	break	it	down	to	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	 real 	 ities 	 	.
and	human	 right 	 s 	 	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 pro 	 position 	 	:	can	i	give	 th 	 is 	 	person	 the 	 ir 	 	dignity	back	?
people	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	human	 right 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 viol 	 ated 	 	--	the	crux	of	that	is	the	loss	of	dignity	,	the	lack	of	dignity	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	with	just	giving	people	back	 the 	 ir 	 	dignity	.
i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	 s 	 lum 	 	 out 	 side 	 	gurgaon	just	next	to	delhi	,	one	of	the	 flash 	 iest 	 	,	 bright 	 est 	 	new	cities	 pop 	 ping 	 	up	in	india	right	now	,	and	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 work 	 ers 	 	who	 work 	 ed 	 	in	 gar 	 ment 	 	 sweat 	 shop 	 s 	 	down	the	road	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	what	 mess 	 age 	 	they	would	like	me	to	take	to	the	 brand 	 s 	 	.
they	did	n't	say	money	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	people	who	employ	us	treat	us	like	we	are	less	than	human	,	like	we	do	n't	exist	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	ask	them	to	treat	us	like	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	``
that	's	my	simple	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	human	 right 	 s 	 	.
that	's	my	simple	 pro 	 position 	 	to	you	,	my	simple	 ple 	 a 	 	to	every	decision	-	maker	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	 every 	 body 	 	out	there	.
we	can	all	make	a	decision	to	come	together	and	pick	up	the	 ball 	 s 	 	and	run	with	the	 ball 	 s 	 	that	 government 	 s 	 	have	 drop 	 ped 	 	.
if	we	do	n't	do	it	,	we	're	 abandon 	 ing 	 	hope	,	we	're	 abandon 	 ing 	 	our	essential	 human 	 ity 	 	,	and	i	know	that	's	not	a	place	we	want	to	be	,	and	we	do	n't	have	to	be	there	.
so	i	appeal	to	you	.
join	us	,	come	 in 	 to 	 	that	safe	space	,	and	let	's	start	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	happen	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
