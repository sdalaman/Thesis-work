i	run	a	design	studio	in	new	york	.
every	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	close	it	for	one	year	to	pursue	some	little	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ways 	 	difficult	to	accomplish	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	regular	 work 	 ing 	 	year	.
in	that	year	,	we	are	not	 avail 	 able 	 	for	any	of	our	 client 	 s 	 	.
we	are	 total 	 ly 	 	closed	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	it	is	a	 love 	 ly 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 energ 	 etic 	 	time	.
i	 original 	 ly 	 	had	 open 	 ed 	 	the	studio	in	new	york	to	combine	my	two	 love 	 s 	 	,	music	and	design	.
and	we	 create 	 d 	 	 video 	 s 	 	and	 pack 	 aging 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 music 	 ians 	 	that	you	know	,	and	for	even	more	that	you	've	never	heard	of	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	just	like	with	 man 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	my	life	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	love	,	i	adapt	to	it	.
and	i	get	,	over	time	,	 bor 	 ed 	 	by	them	.
and	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	in	our	case	,	our	work	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	the	same	.
you	see	here	a	glass	eye	in	a	die	cut	of	a	book	.
 quit 	 e 	 	the	similar	idea	,	then	,	a	perfume	 package 	 d 	 	in	a	book	,	in	a	die	cut	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	close	it	down	for	one	year	.
 al 	 so 	 	is	the	knowledge	that	right	now	we	 s 	 pend 	 	about	in	the	first	25	 year 	 s 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	then	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	40	 year 	 s 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	for	 work 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	 tack 	 ed 	 	on	at	the	end	of	it	are	about	15	 year 	 s 	 	for	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
and	i	thought	it	might	be	 help 	 ful 	 	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	cut	off	five	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 retire 	 ment 	 	 year 	 s 	 	and	intersperse	them	in	between	 t 	 hose 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	 enjoy 	 able 	 	for	 my 	 self 	 	.
but	 prob 	 ably 	 	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	the	work	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	these	 year 	 s 	 	 flow 	 s 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	company	and	 in 	 to 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	at	large	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	 benefit 	 ing 	 	a	 grand 	 child 	 	or	two	.
there	is	a	fellow	tedster	who	spoke	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	jonathan	haidt	,	who	defined	his	work	 in 	 to 	 	three	different	 level 	 s 	 	.
and	they	rang	 ver 	 y 	 	true	for	me	.
i	can	see	my	work	 a 	 s 	 	a	job	.	i	do	it	for	money	.
i	 like 	 ly 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	look	forward	to	the	 week 	 end 	 	on	thursdays	.
and	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	will	need	a	hobby	 a 	 s 	 	a	 level 	 ing 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
in	a	 care 	 er 	 	i	'm	 definite 	 ly 	 	more	 engag 	 ed 	 	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	there	will	be	 period 	 s 	 	when	i	think	is	all	that	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	work	 re 	 ally 	 	worth	my	while	?
while	in	the	third	one	,	in	the	 call 	 ing 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 like 	 ly 	 	i	would	do	it	 al 	 so 	 	if	i	would	n't	be	 financial 	 ly 	 	 compens 	 ated 	 	for	it	.
i	am	not	a	religious	person	 my 	 self 	 	,	but	i	did	look	for	nature	.
i	had	 s 	 pent 	 	my	first	sabbatical	in	new	york	city	.
 look 	 ed 	 	for	 some 	 thing 	 	different	for	the	second	one	.
europe	and	the	u.s.	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	 ent 	 ic 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 k 	 new 	 	them	too	well	.	so	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	it	was	.
the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	i	had	 s 	 een 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	 we 	 re 	 	sri	lanka	and	bali	.
sri	lanka	still	had	the	civil	war	going	on	,	so	bali	it	was	.
it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	craft	-	oriented	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	there	in	september	2008	,	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 start 	 ed 	 	to	work	right	away	.
there	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	inspiration	coming	from	the	area	 it 	 self 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	the	first	thing	that	i	 need 	 ed 	 	was	mosquito	 repel 	 lent 	 	 typo 	 graphy 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 definite 	 ly 	 	around	 heav 	 ily 	 	.
and	then	i	 need 	 ed 	 	some	sort	of	way	to	be	able	to	get	back	to	all	the	wild	 dog 	 s 	 	that	surround	my	house	,	and	 attack 	 ed 	 	me	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	 morn 	 ing 	 	 walk 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	of	99	 portrait 	 s 	 	on	tee	 shirt 	 s 	 	.
every	single	dog	on	one	tee	shirt	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	little	 retali 	 ation 	 	with	a	just	ever	so	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 menac 	 ing 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	on	the	back	of	the	shirt	.
just	before	i	left	new	york	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	renovate	my	studio	.
and	then	just	 leav 	 e 	 	it	all	to	them	.
and	i	do	n't	have	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
so	i	 look 	 ed 	 	for	furniture	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	all	the	furniture	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 like 	 d 	 	,	i	could	n't	afford	.
and	all	the	stuff	i	could	afford	,	i	did	n't	like	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	 pursue 	 d 	 	in	bali	was	 piece 	 s 	 	of	furniture	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	,	of	course	,	still	 work 	 s 	 	with	the	wild	 dog 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 finish 	 ed 	 	yet	.
and	i	think	by	the	time	 th 	 is 	 	lamp	came	about	,	i	had	 final 	 ly 	 	made	peace	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	.
then	there	is	a	coffee	table	.	i	 al 	 so 	 	did	a	coffee	table	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	be	here	now	.
it	 include 	 s 	 	330	 compass 	 es 	 	.
and	we	had	custom	espresso	 cup 	 s 	 	made	that	hide	a	magnet	 in 	 side 	 	,	and	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 compass 	 es 	 	go	crazy	,	 al 	 ways 	 	 center 	 ing 	 	on	them	.
then	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 ative 	 	,	 verb 	 ose 	 	kind	of	chair	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 medit 	 ating 	 	for	the	first	time	in	my	life	in	bali	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	i	'm	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	aware	how	 bor 	 ing 	 	it	is	to	hear	about	other	people	's	 happiness 	 es 	 	.
so	i	will	not	 re 	 ally 	 	go	too	far	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	know	 th 	 is 	 	tedster	,	danny	gilbert	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	book	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	got	it	through	the	ted	book	club	.
i	think	it	took	me	four	 year 	 s 	 	to	 final 	 ly 	 	read	it	,	while	on	sabbatical	.
and	i	was	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	see	that	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	wrote	the	book	while	he	was	on	sabbatical	.
and	i	'll	show	you	a	couple	of	people	that	did	well	by	 pur 	 suing 	 	 sabbatical 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	ferran	adria	.	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	he	is	right	now	the	best	chef	in	the	world	with	his	restaurant	north	of	barcelona	,	el	bulli	.
his	restaurant	is	open	seven	 month 	 s 	 	every	year	.
he	 close 	 s 	 	it	down	for	five	 month 	 s 	 	to	experiment	with	a	full	kitchen	staff	.
his	 lat 	 est 	 	 number 	 s 	 	are	 fair 	 ly 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	.
he	can	seat	,	 through 	 out 	 	the	year	,	he	can	seat	8,000	people	.
and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	2.2	million	 request 	 s 	 	for	 reservation 	 s 	 	.
if	i	look	at	my	cycle	,	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	one	year	sabbatical	,	it	's	12.5	percent	of	my	time	.
and	if	i	look	at	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 success 	 ful 	 	than	mine	,	3m	since	the	1930s	is	giving	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	15	percent	to	pursue	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	.
there	is	some	good	 success 	 es 	 	.
 s 	 co 	 tch 	 	tape	came	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	program	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	art	fry	 develop 	 ed 	 	 stick 	 y 	 	 note 	 s 	 	from	 dur 	 ing 	 	his	personal	time	for	3m	.
google	,	of	course	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 famous 	 ly 	 	 give 	 s 	 	20	percent	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	to	pursue	 the 	 ir 	 	own	personal	 project 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 body 	 	in	here	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	ever	 conduct 	 ed 	 	a	sabbatical	?
that	's	about	five	percent	of	 every 	 body 	 	.
so	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	if	you	saw	your	neighbor	 put 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	up	.
talk	to	them	about	if	it	was	 success 	 ful 	 	or	not	.
i	've	found	that	 find 	 ing 	 	out	about	what	i	'm	going	to	like	in	the	future	,	my	 ver 	 y 	 	best	way	is	to	talk	to	people	who	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	it	much	better	than	 my 	 self 	 	 envision 	 ing 	 	it	.
when	i	had	the	idea	of	 do 	 ing 	 	one	,	the	process	was	i	made	the	decision	and	i	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	my	 dai 	 ly 	 	 plan 	 ner 	 	book	.
and	then	i	told	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	i	possibly	could	about	it	so	that	there	was	no	way	that	i	could	chicken	out	 lat 	 er 	 	on	.
in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	on	the	first	sabbatical	,	it	was	 ra 	 ther 	 	 dis 	 astro 	 us 	 	.
i	had	thought	that	i	should	do	 th 	 is 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	plan	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	vacuum	of	time	 some 	 how 	 	would	be	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	 ent 	 ic 	 ing 	 	for	idea	generation	.	it	was	not	.
i	just	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	plan	,	i	just	 react 	 ed 	 	to	little	 request 	 s 	 	,	not	work	 request 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	i	all	 s 	 aid 	 	no	to	,	but	other	little	 request 	 s 	 	.
 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	mail	to	japanese	design	 magazine 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
so	i	 be 	 came 	 	my	own	intern	.
and	i	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	made	a	list	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	put	them	in	a	 hierarch 	 y 	 	,	 divid 	 ed 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 chunk 	 s 	 	of	time	and	then	made	a	plan	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	in	grade	school	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	say	here	?	monday	,	8	to	9	:	story	writing	;	9	to	10	:	future	 think 	 ing 	 	.
was	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.	and	so	on	and	so	forth	.
and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 start 	 ing 	 	point	of	the	first	sabbatical	,	 work 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	for	me	.
what	came	out	of	it	?
i	 re 	 ally 	 	got	close	to	design	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	had	 f 	 un 	 	.
 financial 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 een 	 	over	the	long	term	,	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 improv 	 ed 	 	quality	,	we	could	ask	for	 high 	 er 	 	 price 	 s 	 	.
and	 prob 	 ably 	 	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	seven	 year 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	first	sabbatical	came	out	of	 think 	 ing 	 	of	that	one	single	year	.
and	i	'll	show	you	a	couple	of	 project 	 s 	 	that	came	out	of	the	seven	 year 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	that	sabbatical	.
one	of	the	 strand 	 s 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	i	was	 involve 	 d 	 	in	was	that	 same 	 ness 	 	is	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 over 	 rated 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	idea	that	 every 	 thing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 work 	 s 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	few	strand	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	and	not	for	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	design	an	 ident 	 ity 	 	for	casa	da	 music 	 a 	 	,	the	rem	koolhaas	-	built	music	center	in	porto	,	in	portugal	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	 desir 	 ed 	 	to	do	an	 ident 	 ity 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	use	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	i	 fail 	 ed 	 	at	that	.
and	 most 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	out	of	a	rem	koolhaas	 present 	 ation 	 	to	the	city	of	porto	,	where	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	a	 con 	 glom 	 er 	 ation 	 	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	of	meaning	.
which	i	 under 	 stood 	 	after	i	 transl 	 ated 	 	it	from	 architect 	 ure 	 	speech	in	to	regular	english	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	 a 	 s 	 	logo	making	.
and	i	 under 	 stood 	 	that	the	building	 it 	 self 	 	was	a	logo	.
so	then	it	 be 	 came 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	easy	.
we	put	a	mask	on	it	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	deep	down	in	the	ground	,	 check 	 ed 	 	it	out	from	all	 side 	 s 	 	,	west	,	north	,	south	,	east	,	top	and	bottom	.
 color 	 ed 	 	them	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	way	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	friend	of	mine	write	a	piece	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	the	casa	da	 music 	 a 	 	logo	 gene 	 rator 	 	.
that	's	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	a	scanner	.
you	put	any	image	in	there	,	like	that	beethoven	image	.
and	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	in	a	second	,	will	give	you	the	casa	da	 music 	 a 	 	beethoven	logo	.
which	,	when	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	design	a	beethoven	 post 	 er 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	in	 hand 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	visual	information	of	the	logo	and	the	actual	 post 	 er 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
so	it	will	 al 	 ways 	 	fit	together	,	 conceptual 	 ly 	 	,	of	course	.
if	zappa	's	music	is	 perform 	 ed 	 	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	logo	.
or	philip	glass	or	lou	 re 	 ed 	 	or	the	chemical	 brother 	 s 	 	,	who	all	 perform 	 ed 	 	there	,	get	 the 	 ir 	 	own	casa	da	 music 	 a 	 	logo	.
it	 work 	 s 	 	the	same	 internal 	 ly 	 	with	the	 p 	 resident 	 	or	the	musical	director	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	casa	da	 music 	 a 	 	 portrait 	 s 	 	wind	up	on	 the 	 ir 	 	business	 card 	 s 	 	.
there	is	a	full	-	blown	orchestra	living	 in 	 side 	 	the	building	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	more	 trans 	 parent 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
the	truck	they	go	on	tour	with	.
or	there	's	a	 small 	 er 	 	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	orchestra	,	12	people	that	 remix 	 es 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	title	.
and	one	of	the	 hand 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	came	about	was	that	you	could	take	the	logo	type	and	create	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	out	of	it	.
like	 th 	 is 	 	donna	toney	 post 	 er 	 	,	or	chopin	,	or	mozart	,	or	la	monte	young	.
you	can	take	the	shape	and	make	 typo 	 graphy 	 	out	of	it	.
you	can	grow	it	 under 	 neath 	 	the	skin	.
you	can	have	a	 post 	 er 	 	for	a	family	event	in	front	of	the	house	,	or	a	rave	 under 	 neath 	 	the	house	or	a	 week 	 ly 	 	program	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 education 	 al 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.
second	 in 	 sight 	 	.	so	far	,	 un 	 til 	 	that	point	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	or	used	the	language	of	design	for	 pro 	 motion 	 al 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	,	which	was	fine	with	me	.
on	one	hand	i	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	against	selling	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	are	both	 sale 	 s 	 people 	 	.
but	i	did	feel	that	i	 s 	 pent 	 	so	much	time	 learn 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	language	,	why	do	i	 on 	 ly 	 	promote	with	it	?
there	must	be	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	the	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	work	came	out	of	it	.
some	of	you	might	have	 s 	 een 	 	it	.
i	 show 	 ed 	 	some	of	it	at	 ear 	 lier 	 	teds	before	,	under	the	title	``	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	my	life	so	far	.	``
i	'll	just	show	two	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	whole	wall	of	 banana 	 s 	 	on	the	 open 	 ing 	 	day	in	 th 	 is 	 	 gall 	 ery 	 	in	new	york	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	self	-	confidence	 produce 	 s 	 	fine	 result 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	after	a	week	.
after	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	three	 week 	 s 	 	,	four	 week 	 s 	 	,	five	 week 	 s 	 	.
and	you	see	the	self	confidence	 al 	 most 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	,	but	not	 quit 	 e 	 	.
these	are	some	 picture 	 s 	 	 visit 	 ors 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	to	me	.
and	then	the	city	of	amsterdam	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	plaza	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
we	used	the	stone	 plate 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	grid	for	our	little	piece	.
we	got	250,000	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	from	the	central	bank	,	at	different	 dark 	 ness 	 es 	 	.
so	we	got	brand	new	 one 	 s 	 	,	 shin 	 y 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	medium	 one 	 s 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	old	,	dark	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	with	the	help	of	100	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	over	a	week	,	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	 flor 	 al 	 	 typo 	 graphy 	 	that	 spell 	 ed 	 	,	``	 obsession 	 s 	 	make	my	life	 wo 	 rse 	 	and	my	work	better	.	``
and	the	idea	of	course	was	to	make	the	type	so	precious	that	 a 	 s 	 	an	audience	you	would	be	in	between	,	``	should	i	 re 	 ally 	 	take	 a 	 s 	 	much	money	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	?
or	should	i	 leav 	 e 	 	the	piece	 in 	 tact 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	right	now	?	``
while	we	built	all	 th 	 is 	 	up	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	week	,	with	the	100	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	a	good	number	of	the	 neighbor 	 s 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 	the	plaza	got	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	it	and	 quit 	 e 	 	 love 	 d 	 	it	.
so	when	it	was	 final 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	in	the	first	night	a	guy	came	with	big	plastic	 bag 	 s 	 	and	 scoop 	 ed 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	he	could	possibly	carry	,	one	of	the	 neighbor 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	police	.
and	the	amsterdam	police	in	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	came	,	saw	,	and	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	protect	the	 art 	 work 	 	.
and	they	 s 	 wept 	 	it	all	up	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	 cus 	 to 	 dy 	 	at	police	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
i	think	you	see	,	you	see	them	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	.	you	see	them	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	right	here	.
that	's	the	police	,	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	it	all	.
so	after	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	all	that	was	left	of	the	whole	thing	.
we	are	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	start	of	a	 big 	 ger 	 	project	in	bali	.
it	's	a	movie	about	happiness	.
and	here	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	some	 near 	 by 	 	 pig 	 s 	 	to	do	the	 title 	 s 	 	for	us	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 lick 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.
so	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	goose	to	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	 hop 	 ed 	 	she	would	do	 some 	 how 	 	,	a	more	elegant	or	 pre 	 tty 	 	job	.
and	i	think	she	 over 	 did 	 	it	.
just	a	bit	too	 orna 	 mental 	 	.
and	my	studio	is	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	the	monkey	forest	.
and	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	in	that	monkey	forest	 look 	 ed 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 fair 	 ly 	 	happy	.
so	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	to	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
they	did	a	fine	job	,	but	had	a	couple	of	 read 	 ability 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	of	course	 what 	 ever 	 	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	do	 your 	 self 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	get	 d 	 one 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
that	film	we	'll	be	 work 	 ing 	 	on	for	the	next	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	going	to	be	a	while	.
and	of	course	you	might	think	that	 do 	 ing 	 	a	film	on	happiness	might	not	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 worth 	 while 	 	.
then	you	can	of	course	 al 	 ways 	 	go	and	see	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
