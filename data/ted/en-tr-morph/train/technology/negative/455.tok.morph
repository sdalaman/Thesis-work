'	theme	and	 vari 	 ations 	 	'	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 form 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	a	certain	kind	of	intellectual	activity	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 compar 	 ing 	 	the	 vari 	 ation 	 	with	the	theme	that	you	hold	in	your	mind	.
you	might	say	that	the	theme	is	nature	and	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 follow 	 s 	 	is	a	 vari 	 ation 	 	on	the	subject	.
i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	i	guess	about	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	to	do	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	in	some	way	would	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	birth	of	piero	 d 	 ella 	 	francesca	.
and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	for	me	to	imagine	how	to	paint	 picture 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	based	on	piero	 un 	 til 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	could	look	at	piero	 a 	 s 	 	nature	--	that	i	would	have	the	same	attitude	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	looking	at	piero	 d 	 ella 	 	francesca	 a 	 s 	 	i	would	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	looking	out	a	window	at	a	tree	.
and	that	was	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 liber 	 ating 	 	to	me	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	's	not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 sight 	 ful 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	but	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	me	on	a	path	to	be	able	to	do	a	kind	of	theme	and	 vari 	 ations 	 	based	on	a	work	by	piero	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	that	 remark 	 able 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	that	's	in	the	uffizi	,	``	the	 du 	 ke 	 	of	montefeltro	,	``	who	 face 	 s 	 	his	 con 	 sort 	 	,	battista	.
once	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	could	take	some	 liber 	 ties 	 	with	the	subject	,	i	did	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	real	piero	 d 	 ella 	 	francesca	--	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 portrait 	 s 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	these	,	i	'll	just	show	these	 with 	 out 	 	comment	.
it	's	just	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 vari 	 ations 	 	on	the	head	of	the	 du 	 ke 	 	of	montefeltro	,	who	's	a	great	,	great	figure	in	the	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	machiavelli	's	``	the	prince	.	``
he	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	lost	an	eye	in	battle	,	which	is	why	he	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 show 	 n 	 	in	profile	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	battista	.
and	then	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	could	move	them	around	a	little	bit	--	so	that	for	the	first	time	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	they	're	facing	the	same	direction	.
whoops	!	 pass 	 ed 	 	each	other	.
and	then	a	 visit 	 or 	 	from	 an 	 other 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	by	piero	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	``	the	 resurrect 	 ion 	 	of	christ	``	--	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	cast	had	just	gotten	of	the	set	to	have	a	chat	.
and	now	,	four	large	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	upper	left	;	upper	right	;	lower	left	;	lower	right	.
 incident 	 ally 	 	,	i	've	never	 under 	 stood 	 	the	conflict	between	 abstract 	 ion 	 	and	 natural 	 ism 	 	.
since	all	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 inherent 	 ly 	 	abstract	to	begin	with	there	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	to	be	an	argument	there	.
on	 an 	 other 	 	subject	--	--	i	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	in	the	country	one	day	with	my	wife	,	and	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	sign	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	is	a	fabulous	piece	of	design	.	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	are	you	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	it	's	so	 persuas 	 ive 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	purpose	of	that	sign	is	to	get	you	 in 	 to 	 	the	 gar 	 age 	 	,	and	since	most	people	are	so	suspicious	of	 gar 	 age 	 s 	 	,	and	know	that	they	're	going	to	be	 rip 	 ped 	 	off	,	they	use	the	word	'	 reli 	 able 	 	.	'	but	 every 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	they	're	 reli 	 able 	 	.
but	,	 reli 	 able 	 	dutchman	``	--	--	``	fantastic	!	``
 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	you	hear	the	word	dutchman	--	which	is	an	 arch 	 a 	 ic 	 	word	,	 no 	 body 	 	 call 	 s 	 	dutch	people	``	dutchmen	``	 any 	 more 	 	--	but	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	you	hear	dutchman	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	picture	of	the	kid	with	his	finger	in	the	dike	,	 prevent 	 ing 	 	the	thing	from	 fall 	 ing 	 	and	 flood 	 ing 	 	holland	,	and	so	on	.
and	so	the	entire	issue	is	 detox 	 ified 	 	by	the	use	of	``	dutchman	.	``
now	,	if	you	think	i	'm	 exagge 	 rating 	 	at	all	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	all	you	have	to	do	is	 substitut 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	like	``	indonesian	.	``
or	even	``	french	.	``
now	,	``	swiss	``	 work 	 s 	 	,	but	you	know	it	's	going	to	cost	a	lot	of	money	.
i	'm	going	to	take	you	 quick 	 ly 	 	through	the	actual	process	of	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 post 	 er 	 	.
i	do	a	lot	of	work	for	the	school	of	visual	 art 	 s 	 	,	where	i	teach	,	and	the	director	of	 th 	 is 	 	school	--	a	 remark 	 able 	 	man	named	silas	rhodes	--	often	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	piece	of	text	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	so	he	did	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	text	--	``	in	 word 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	fashion	the	same	rule	will	hold	/	 a 	 like 	 	fantastic	if	too	new	or	old	/	be	not	the	first	by	whom	the	new	are	 tri 	 ed 	 	/	nor	yet	the	last	to	lay	the	old	 a 	 side 	 	.	``
i	could	make	 noth 	 ing 	 	of	that	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
and	the	first	thing	i	did	,	which	was	sort	of	in	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	idea	,	was	say	i	'll	sort	of	write	it	out	and	make	some	 word 	 s 	 	big	,	and	i	'll	have	some	kind	of	design	on	the	back	 some 	 how 	 	,	and	i	was	 hop 	 ing 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	one	often	 do 	 es 	 	--	to	 s 	 tumble 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	i	took	 an 	 other 	 	crack	at	it	--	you	've	got	to	keep	it	moving	--	and	i	xeroxed	some	 word 	 s 	 	on	 piece 	 s 	 	of	 color 	 ed 	 	paper	and	i	 past 	 ed 	 	them	down	on	an	 ug 	 ly 	 	board	.
i	thought	that	 some 	 thing 	 	would	come	out	of	it	,	like	``	 word 	 s 	 	rule	fantastic	new	old	first	last	 pop 	 e 	 	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	by	alexander	 pop 	 e 	 	,	but	i	sort	of	made	a	mess	out	of	it	,	and	then	i	thought	i	'd	repeat	it	in	some	way	so	it	was	 leg 	 ible 	 	.
so	,	it	was	going	 no 	 where 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	in	the	middle	of	a	resistant	problem	,	i	write	down	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	know	about	it	.
but	you	can	see	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	an	idea	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	see	the	word	``	new	``	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	the	``	old	.	``
that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	relationship	between	the	old	and	the	new	;	the	new	 emerge 	 s 	 	from	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	the	old	.
and	then	i	did	some	 vari 	 ations 	 	of	it	,	but	it	still	was	n't	 coal 	 esc 	 ing 	 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	at	all	.
i	had	 th 	 is 	 	other	version	which	had	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	it	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	put	it	together	in	your	mind	from	 clue 	 s 	 	.
the	w	was	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	w	,	the	n	was	 clear 	 ly 	 	an	n	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 fragment 	 ary 	 	and	there	was	n't	a	lot	of	information	in	it	.
then	i	got	the	 word 	 s 	 	``	new	``	and	``	old	``	and	now	i	had	 regress 	 ed 	 	back	to	a	point	where	there	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	no	return	.
i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	desperate	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
and	so	,	i	do	 some 	 thing 	 	i	'm	 truth 	 fully 	 	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	of	,	which	is	that	i	took	two	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	i	had	made	for	 an 	 other 	 	purpose	and	i	put	them	together	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	``	 dream 	 s 	 	``	at	the	top	.
and	i	was	going	to	do	a	thing	,	i	say	,	``	well	,	change	the	copy	.
let	it	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 dream 	 s 	 	,	and	come	to	sva	and	you	'll	sort	of	fulfill	your	 dream 	 s 	 	.	``
but	,	to	my	credit	,	i	was	so	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	about	 do 	 ing 	 	that	that	i	never	 submit 	 ted 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sketch	.
and	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	solution	.
now	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 distinguish 	 es 	 	it	from	a	lot	of	other	 post 	 ers 	 	.
for	one	thing	,	it	 transgress 	 es 	 	the	idea	of	what	a	 post 	 er 	 	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	,	which	is	to	be	 under 	 stood 	 	and	 s 	 een 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	and	not	 explain 	 ed 	 	.
i	remember	 hear 	 ing 	 	all	of	you	in	the	graphic	 art 	 s 	 	--	``	if	you	have	to	explain	it	,	it	ai	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	one	day	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	suppose	that	's	not	true	?	``
so	here	's	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	in	my	 explan 	 ation 	 	at	the	bottom	left	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 thought 	 s 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	poem	is	 im 	 possible 	 	.
silas	 usual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	better	touch	with	his	choice	of	 quota 	 tions 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	 generate 	 s 	 	no	 image 	 ry 	 	at	all	.	``
i	am	now	 ex 	 posing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	my	audience	,	right	?
which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	never	want	to	do	 professional 	 ly 	 	.
``	 may 	 be 	 	the	 word 	 s 	 	can	make	the	image	 with 	 out 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	else	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
what	's	the	heart	of	 th 	 is 	 	poem	?
do	n't	be	 trend 	 y 	 	if	you	want	to	be	serious	.
is	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 post 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	 trend 	 y 	 	in	 it 	 self 	 	?
i	guess	one	could	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	idea	further	by	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	the	new	 emerge 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	and	through	the	old	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	then	i	show	you	a	little	 draw 	 ing 	 	--	you	see	,	you	remember	that	old	thing	i	 dis 	 card 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	i	found	a	way	to	use	it	.
so	,	there	's	that	little	 alter 	 native 	 	over	there	,	and	i	say	,	``	not	bad	,	``	--	 critic 	 izing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	--	``	but	more	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	than	visual	.
 may 	 be 	 	what	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	 s 	 aid 	 	is	that	old	and	the	new	are	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	a	 dialect 	 ical 	 	embrace	,	a	kind	of	dance	where	each	 define 	 s 	 	the	other	.	``
and	then	more	self	-	 question 	 ing 	 	--	``	am	i	 be 	 ing 	 	simple	-	minded	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	the	kind	of	simple	that	 look 	 s 	 	obvious	,	or	the	kind	that	 look 	 s 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	?
there	's	a	significant	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	could	be	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	 real 	 ize 	 	fear	of	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	 drive 	 s 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	any	 ambit 	 ion 	 	.
do	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	could	 re 	 ally 	 	attract	a	student	to	the	school	?	``
well	,	i	think	there	are	two	fresh	 thing 	 s 	 	here	--	two	fresh	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	is	the	sort	of	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	 ex 	 pose 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	a	critical	audience	,	and	not	to	suggest	that	i	am	confident	about	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	you	have	to	have	a	front	.
i	mean	--	you	've	got	to	be	confident	;	if	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	your	work	,	who	else	is	going	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	it	?
so	that	's	one	thing	,	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	the	idea	of	doubt	 in 	 to 	 	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
that	can	be	a	big	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	.
the	other	thing	is	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	give	you	two	 solution 	 s 	 	for	the	price	of	one	;	you	get	the	big	one	and	if	you	do	n't	like	that	,	how	about	the	little	one	?
and	that	too	is	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	new	idea	.
and	here	's	just	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	where	i	ask	the	question	of	--	 do 	 es 	 	a	 post 	 er 	 	have	to	be	square	?
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	illusion	.
that	 post 	 er 	 	is	not	 fold 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	not	 fold 	 ed 	 	,	that	's	a	photograph	and	it	's	cut	on	the	diagonal	.
same	cheap	trick	in	the	upper	left	-	hand	corner	.
and	here	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	peculiar	 post 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	using	the	 iso 	 metric 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	in	the	computer	,	it	wo	n't	 s 	 it 	 	still	in	the	space	.
at	 time 	 s 	 	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 wide 	 r 	 	at	the	back	than	the	front	,	and	then	it	 shift 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	 s 	 it 	 	here	long	 en 	 ough 	 	,	it	'll	float	off	the	page	 in 	 to 	 	the	audience	.
but	,	we	do	n't	have	time	.
and	then	an	experiment	--	a	little	bit	about	the	nature	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	where	the	 out 	 side 	 	shape	is	 determine 	 d 	 	by	the	 peculiar 	 ity 	 	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	but	the	shape	of	the	bottle	--	which	is	 ident 	 ical 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	shape	--	is	 s 	 een 	 	 frontal 	 ly 	 	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	piece	for	the	art	 director 	 s 	 	'	club	is	``	anna	rees	``	 cast 	 ing 	 	long	 shadow 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 post 	 er 	 	from	the	school	of	visual	 art 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	10	 artist 	 s 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	it	,	and	it	was	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	where	it	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	competitive	and	i	did	n't	want	to	be	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	,	so	i	 work 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	idea	was	--	and	it	was	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	idea	--	was	to	have	10	 post 	 ers 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	city	's	 sub 	 way 	 	system	so	every	time	you	got	on	the	 sub 	 way 	 	you	'd	be	 pass 	 ing 	 	a	different	 post 	 er 	 	,	all	of	which	had	a	different	idea	of	what	art	is	.
but	i	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	on	the	idea	of	``	art	is	``	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	determine	what	art	was	.
but	then	i	 g 	 ave 	 	up	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	art	is	 what 	 ever 	 	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	the	word	``	hat	``	was	 hid 	 den 	 	in	the	word	``	 what 	 ever 	 	,	``	and	that	led	me	to	the	 inevit 	 able 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	.
but	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	on	my	list	of	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	 post 	 ers 	 	.
my	intent	is	to	have	a	 liter 	 ary 	 	 accompani 	 ment 	 	that	 explain 	 s 	 	the	 post 	 er 	 	,	in	case	you	do	n't	get	it	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	note	to	the	 view 	 er 	 	:	i	thought	i	might	use	a	visual	cliche	of	our	time	--	magritte	's	 every 	 man 	 	--	to	express	the	idea	that	art	is	 myster 	 y 	 	,	 continu 	 ity 	 	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	.

and	the	one	that	i	did	not	submit	,	which	i	still	like	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	use	the	same	phrase	.
