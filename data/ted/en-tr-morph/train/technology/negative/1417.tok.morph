i	was	born	in	den	bosch	,	where	the	 paint 	 er 	 	hieronymus	bosch	named	 him 	 self 	 	after	.
and	so	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fond	of	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 er 	 	who	lived	and	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	15th	century	.
and	what	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	him	in	relation	to	 moral 	 ity 	 	is	that	he	lived	at	a	time	where	 relig 	 ion 	 	's	influence	was	 wan 	 ing 	 	,	and	he	was	sort	of	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	i	think	,	what	would	happen	with	 socie 	 ty 	 	if	there	was	no	 relig 	 ion 	 	or	if	there	was	less	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
and	so	he	 paint 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	famous	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	``	the	garden	of	 earth 	 ly 	 	delights	,	``	which	some	have	 interpret 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	before	the	fall	,	or	 be 	 ing 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	fall	at	all	.
and	so	it	 make 	 s 	 	you	wonder	,	what	would	happen	if	we	had	n't	 taste 	 d 	 	the	fruit	of	knowledge	,	so	to	speak	,	and	what	kind	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	would	we	have	?
much	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	student	,	i	went	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	garden	,	a	 zoo 	 logical 	 	garden	in	arnhem	where	we	keep	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	me	at	an	early	age	with	a	baby	chimpanzee	.
and	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	there	that	the	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	power	 hung 	 ry 	 	and	wrote	a	book	about	it	.
and	at	that	time	the	focus	in	a	lot	of	animal	research	was	on	 aggress 	 ion 	 	and	 com 	 petition 	 	.
i	 paint 	 ed 	 	a	whole	picture	of	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	,	and	 human 	 ity 	 	 include 	 d 	 	,	was	that	deep	down	we	are	 competitor 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 aggress 	 ive 	 	,	we	're	all	out	for	our	own	profit	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	launch	of	my	book	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	how	well	the	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	read	it	,	but	they	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	book	.
now	in	the	process	of	 do 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	work	on	power	and	 domin 	 ance 	 	and	 aggress 	 ion 	 	and	so	on	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	reconcile	after	 fight 	 s 	 	.
and	so	what	you	see	here	is	two	 male 	 s 	 	who	have	had	a	fight	.
they	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	a	tree	,	and	one	of	them	 hold 	 s 	 	out	a	hand	to	the	other	.
and	about	a	second	after	i	took	the	picture	,	they	came	together	in	the	 for 	 k 	 	of	the	tree	and	they	 kiss 	 ed 	 	and	 embrace 	 d 	 	each	other	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	at	the	time	 every 	 thing 	 	was	about	 com 	 petition 	 	and	 aggress 	 ion 	 	,	and	so	it	would	n't	make	any	sense	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	 matter 	 s 	 	is	that	you	win	or	that	you	lose	.
but	why	would	you	reconcile	after	a	fight	?
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	do	it	.	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	do	 every 	 thing 	 	with	 s 	 ex 	 	.
and	so	they	 al 	 so 	 	reconcile	with	 s 	 ex 	 	.
but	the	principle	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
the	principle	is	that	you	have	a	 valu 	 able 	 	relationship	that	is	 damage 	 d 	 	by	conflict	,	so	you	need	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
so	my	whole	picture	of	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	,	and	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 human 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	to	change	at	that	time	.
so	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	image	in	 politic 	 al 	 	science	,	 economic 	 s 	 	,	the	 human 	 ities 	 	,	 philosoph 	 y 	 	for	that	matter	,	that	man	is	a	wolf	to	man	.
and	so	deep	down	our	nature	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	nasty	.
i	think	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 fair 	 	image	for	the	wolf	.
the	wolf	is	,	after	all	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 co 	 operative 	 	animal	.
and	that	's	why	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	a	dog	at	home	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	all	these	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 fair 	 	to	 human 	 ity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	much	more	 co 	 operative 	 	and	 empath 	 ic 	 	than	 give 	 n 	 	credit	for	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	and	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	that	in	other	 animal 	 s 	 	.
so	these	are	the	 pillar 	 s 	 	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
if	you	ask	 any 	 one 	 	,	``	what	is	 moral 	 ity 	 	based	on	?	``
these	are	the	two	 factor 	 s 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	come	out	.
one	is	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	,	and	 associate 	 d 	 	with	it	is	a	sense	of	justice	and	a	sense	of	 fair 	 ness 	 	.
and	the	other	one	is	 empath 	 y 	 	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
and	human	 moral 	 ity 	 	is	more	than	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	if	you	would	 re 	 move 	 	these	two	 pillar 	 s 	 	,	there	would	be	not	much	 remain 	 ing 	 	i	think	.
and	so	they	're	 absolute 	 ly 	 	essential	.
so	let	me	give	you	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	video	from	the	yerkes	 prim 	 ate 	 	center	where	they	train	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	to	cooperate	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	about	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	on	 co 	 operation 	 	.
what	you	have	here	is	two	young	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	who	have	a	box	,	and	the	box	is	too	heavy	for	one	chimp	to	pull	in	.
and	of	course	,	there	's	food	on	the	box	.
 other 	 wise 	 	they	would	n't	be	 pull 	 ing 	 	so	hard	.
and	so	they	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	the	box	.
and	you	can	see	that	they	're	 synchron 	 ized 	 	.
you	can	see	that	they	work	together	,	they	pull	at	the	same	moment	.
it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	a	big	advance	over	 man 	 y 	 	other	 animal 	 s 	 	who	would	n't	be	able	to	do	that	.
and	now	you	're	going	to	get	a	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	picture	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	one	of	the	two	 chimp 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	fed	.
so	one	of	the	two	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	task	 any 	 more 	 	.
now	look	at	what	 happen 	 s 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
he	 take 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
so	there	are	two	 interest 	 ing 	 	 part 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	is	that	the	chimp	on	the	right	 ha 	 s 	 	a	full	 understand 	 ing 	 	he	 need 	 s 	 	the	partner	--	so	a	full	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	need	for	 co 	 operation 	 	.
the	second	one	is	that	the	partner	is	 will 	 ing 	 	to	work	even	 th 	 ough 	 	he	's	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	food	.
why	would	that	be	?	well	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	evidence	in	 prim 	 ates 	 	and	other	 animal 	 s 	 	that	they	return	 favor 	 s 	 	.
so	he	will	get	a	return	favor	at	some	point	in	the	future	.
and	so	that	's	how	 th 	 is 	 	all	 oper 	 ates 	 	.
we	do	the	same	task	with	 elephant 	 s 	 	.
now	with	 elephant 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	to	work	with	 elephant 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	problem	with	 elephant 	 s 	 	is	that	you	can	not	make	an	apparatus	that	is	too	heavy	for	a	single	elephant	.
now	you	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	make	it	,	but	it	's	going	to	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	flimsy	apparatus	i	think	.
and	so	what	we	did	in	that	case	--	we	do	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	in	thailand	for	josh	plotnik	--	is	we	have	an	apparatus	around	which	there	is	a	rope	,	a	single	rope	.
and	if	you	pull	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	of	the	rope	,	the	rope	 disappear 	 s 	 	on	the	other	side	.
so	two	 elephant 	 s 	 	need	to	pick	it	up	at	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	time	and	pull	.
 other 	 wise 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	going	to	happen	and	the	rope	 disappear 	 s 	 	.
and	the	first	tape	you	're	going	to	see	is	two	 elephant 	 s 	 	who	are	released	together	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	the	apparatus	.
the	apparatus	is	on	the	left	with	food	on	it	.
and	so	they	come	together	,	they	 arriv 	 e 	 	together	,	they	pick	it	up	together	and	they	pull	together	.
so	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	for	them	.
there	they	are	.
and	so	that	's	how	they	 br 	 ing 	 	it	in	.
but	now	we	're	going	to	make	it	more	difficult	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	whole	purpose	of	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	is	to	see	how	well	they	understand	 co 	 operation 	 	.
do	they	understand	that	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 chimp 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	?
and	so	what	we	do	in	the	next	step	is	we	 re 	 lease 	 	one	elephant	before	the	other	,	and	that	elephant	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	to	stay	there	and	wait	and	not	pull	at	the	rope	--	 be 	 cause 	 	if	he	 pull 	 s 	 	at	the	rope	,	it	 disappear 	 s 	 	and	the	whole	test	is	over	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	elephant	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	that	we	did	not	teach	it	.
but	it	 show 	 s 	 	the	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	he	 ha 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 put 	 s 	 	his	big	foot	on	the	rope	,	 stand 	 s 	 	on	the	rope	and	 wait 	 s 	 	there	for	the	other	,	and	then	the	other	is	going	to	do	all	the	work	for	him	.
so	it	's	what	we	call	 free 	 load 	 ing 	 	.
but	it	 show 	 s 	 	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	that	the	 elephant 	 s 	 	have	.
they	develop	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	these	 alter 	 native 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	we	did	not	 ap 	 prove 	 	of	 necess 	 arily 	 	.
so	the	other	elephant	is	now	coming	and	is	going	to	pull	it	in	.
now	look	at	the	other	.	the	other	 do 	 es 	 	n't	forget	to	eat	,	of	course	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 co 	 operation 	 	,	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	part	.
now	 some 	 thing 	 	on	 empath 	 y 	 	.
 empath 	 y 	 	is	my	main	 top 	 ic 	 	at	the	moment	of	research	.
and	 empath 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	sort	of	two	 qual 	 ities 	 	.
one	is	the	 understand 	 ing 	 	part	of	it	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	regular	definition	:	the	ability	to	understand	and	share	the	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	part	.
and	so	 empath 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	two	 channel 	 s 	 	.
one	is	the	body	channel	.
if	you	talk	with	a	 s 	 ad 	 	person	,	you	're	going	to	adopt	a	 s 	 ad 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	and	a	 s 	 ad 	 	 post 	 ure 	 	,	and	before	you	know	it	you	feel	 s 	 ad 	 	.
and	that	's	sort	of	the	body	channel	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	 empath 	 y 	 	,	which	 man 	 y 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	have	.
your	average	dog	 ha 	 s 	 	that	 al 	 so 	 	.
that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	why	people	keep	 mammal 	 s 	 	in	the	home	and	not	 turtle 	 s 	 	or	 snake 	 s 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	who	do	n't	have	that	kind	of	 empath 	 y 	 	.
and	then	there	's	a	cognitive	channel	,	which	is	more	that	you	can	take	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
and	that	's	more	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
there	's	few	 animal 	 s 	 	--	i	think	 elephant 	 s 	 	and	 ape 	 s 	 	can	do	that	kind	of	thing	--	but	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 animal 	 s 	 	who	can	do	that	.
so	 synchron 	 ization 	 	,	which	is	part	of	that	whole	 empath 	 y 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	one	in	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	.
and	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	we	can	 stud 	 y 	 	that	with	yawn	 con 	 tag 	 ion 	 	.
 human 	 s 	 	yawn	when	 other 	 s 	 	yawn	.
and	it	's	related	to	 empath 	 y 	 	.
it	 activate 	 s 	 	the	same	 area 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	we	know	that	people	who	have	a	lot	of	yawn	 con 	 tag 	 ion 	 	are	 high 	 ly 	 	 empath 	 ic 	 	.
people	who	have	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 empath 	 y 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 aut 	 istic 	 	children	,	they	do	n't	have	yawn	 con 	 tag 	 ion 	 	.
so	it	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	 stud 	 y 	 	that	in	our	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	by	 present 	 ing 	 	them	with	an	 animate 	 d 	 	head	.
so	that	's	what	you	see	on	the	upper	-	left	,	an	 animate 	 d 	 	head	that	 yawn 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	a	chimpanzee	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	an	actual	real	chimpanzee	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	computer	screen	on	which	we	play	these	 anim 	 ations 	 	.
so	yawn	 con 	 tag 	 ion 	 	that	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	all	familiar	with	--	and	 may 	 be 	 	you	're	going	to	start	 yawn 	 ing 	 	soon	now	--	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	share	with	other	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	related	to	that	whole	body	channel	of	 synchron 	 ization 	 	that	 under 	 lies 	 	 empath 	 y 	 	and	that	is	universal	in	the	 mammal 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
now	we	 al 	 so 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	more	complex	 express 	 ions 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 consol 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	male	chimpanzee	who	 ha 	 s 	 	lost	a	fight	and	he	's	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	,	and	a	juvenile	 come 	 s 	 	over	and	 put 	 s 	 	an	arm	around	him	and	 calm 	 s 	 	him	down	.
that	's	 consol 	 ation 	 	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	human	 consol 	 ation 	 	.
and	 consol 	 ation 	 	behavior	,	it	's	 empath 	 y 	 	driven	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	the	way	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 empath 	 y 	 	in	human	children	is	to	instruct	a	family	member	to	act	 di 	 stress 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	they	see	what	young	children	do	.
and	so	it	is	related	to	 empath 	 y 	 	,	and	that	's	the	kind	of	 express 	 ions 	 	we	look	at	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	an	experiment	you	may	have	heard	about	.
it	's	on	 al 	 truism 	 	and	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	where	the	question	is	,	do	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	care	about	the	 wel 	 fare 	 	of	 some 	 body 	 	else	?
and	for	 decade 	 s 	 	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 human 	 s 	 	can	do	that	,	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 human 	 s 	 	worry	about	the	 wel 	 fare 	 	of	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
now	we	did	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	experiment	.
we	do	that	on	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	that	live	in	lawrenceville	,	in	the	field	station	of	yerkes	.
and	so	that	's	how	they	live	.
and	we	call	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	room	and	do	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	them	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	put	two	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	side	-	by	-	side	.
and	one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 buck 	 et 	 	full	of	 to 	 ken 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 to 	 ken 	 s 	 	have	different	 meaning 	 s 	 	.
one	kind	of	 to 	 ken 	 	 feed 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	the	partner	who	 choos 	 es 	 	,	the	other	one	 feed 	 s 	 	both	of	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 stud 	 y 	 	we	did	with	vicky	horner	.
and	here	you	have	the	two	color	 to 	 ken 	 s 	 	.
so	they	have	a	whole	 buck 	 et 	 	full	of	them	.
and	they	have	to	pick	one	of	the	two	 color 	 s 	 	.
you	will	see	how	that	 go 	 es 	 	.
so	if	 th 	 is 	 	chimp	 make 	 s 	 	the	 self 	 ish 	 	choice	,	which	is	the	red	 to 	 ken 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	he	 need 	 s 	 	to	give	it	to	us	.
so	we	pick	it	up	,	we	put	it	on	a	table	where	there	's	two	food	 reward 	 s 	 	,	but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	 on 	 ly 	 	the	one	on	the	right	 get 	 s 	 	food	.
the	one	on	the	left	 walk 	 s 	 	away	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 know 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	good	test	for	her	.
then	the	next	one	is	the	pro	-	social	 to 	 ken 	 	.
so	the	one	who	 make 	 s 	 	the	 choice 	 s 	 	--	that	's	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	part	here	--	for	the	one	who	 make 	 s 	 	the	 choice 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
so	she	 give 	 s 	 	us	now	a	pro	-	social	 to 	 ken 	 	and	both	 chimp 	 s 	 	get	fed	.
so	the	one	who	 make 	 s 	 	the	 choice 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 get 	 s 	 	a	reward	.
so	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
and	she	should	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 choos 	 ing 	 	 blind 	 ly 	 	.
but	what	we	find	is	that	they	prefer	the	pro	-	social	 to 	 ken 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	50	percent	line	that	's	the	random	 expect 	 ation 	 	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	the	partner	 draw 	 s 	 	attention	to	 it 	 self 	 	,	they	 choos 	 e 	 	more	.
and	if	the	partner	 put 	 s 	 	pressure	on	them	--	so	if	the	partner	 start 	 s 	 	 s 	 pit 	 ting 	 	water	and	 intimid 	 ating 	 	them	--	then	the	 choice 	 s 	 	go	down	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	if	you	're	not	 behav 	 ing 	 	,	i	'm	not	going	to	be	pro	-	social	 to 	 day 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	partner	,	when	there	's	no	partner	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	.
and	so	we	found	that	the	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	do	care	about	the	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	 some 	 body 	 	else	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	these	are	other	 member 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	group	.
so	the	final	experiment	that	i	want	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	to	you	is	our	 fair 	 ness 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	 stud 	 y 	 	.
and	there	's	now	 man 	 y 	 	more	,	 be 	 cause 	 	after	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	known	.
and	we	did	that	 original 	 ly 	 	with	 cap 	 uch 	 in 	 	 monkey 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	first	experiment	that	we	did	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	with	 dog 	 s 	 	and	with	 bird 	 s 	 	and	with	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	.
but	with	sarah	brosnan	we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	 cap 	 uch 	 in 	 	 monkey 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	did	is	we	put	two	 cap 	 uch 	 in 	 	 monkey 	 s 	 	side	-	by	-	side	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	these	 animal 	 s 	 	,	they	live	in	a	group	,	they	know	each	other	.
we	take	them	out	of	the	group	,	put	them	in	a	test	chamber	.
and	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	task	that	they	need	to	do	.
and	if	you	give	both	of	them	cucumber	for	the	task	,	the	two	 monkey 	 s 	 	side	-	by	-	side	,	they	're	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	25	 time 	 s 	 	in	a	row	.
so	cucumber	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	water	in	my	opinion	,	but	cucumber	is	 perfect 	 ly 	 	fine	for	them	.
now	if	you	give	the	partner	 grape 	 s 	 	--	the	food	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	of	my	 cap 	 uch 	 in 	 	 monkey 	 s 	 	correspond	 exact 	 ly 	 	with	the	 price 	 s 	 	in	the	 super 	 market 	 	--	and	so	if	you	give	them	 grape 	 s 	 	--	it	's	a	far	better	food	--	then	you	create	 in 	 equ 	 ity 	 	between	them	.
so	that	's	the	experiment	we	did	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	we	 video 	 taped 	 	it	with	new	 monkey 	 s 	 	who	'd	never	 d 	 one 	 	the	task	,	 think 	 ing 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	they	would	have	a	 strong 	 er 	 	 re 	 action 	 	,	and	that	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	right	.
the	one	on	the	left	is	the	monkey	who	 get 	 s 	 	cucumber	.
the	one	on	the	right	is	the	one	who	 get 	 s 	 	 grape 	 s 	 	.
the	one	who	 get 	 s 	 	cucumber	,	note	that	the	first	piece	of	cucumber	is	 perfect 	 ly 	 	fine	.
the	first	piece	she	eats	.
then	she	 s 	 ees 	 	the	other	one	 get 	 ting 	 	grape	,	and	you	will	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
so	she	 give 	 s 	 	a	rock	to	us	.	that	's	the	task	.
and	we	give	her	a	piece	of	cucumber	and	she	eats	it	.
the	other	one	 need 	 s 	 	to	give	a	rock	to	us	.
and	that	's	what	she	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	she	 get 	 s 	 	a	grape	and	she	eats	it	.
the	other	one	 s 	 ees 	 	that	.
she	 give 	 s 	 	a	rock	to	us	now	,	 get 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	cucumber	.
she	 test 	 s 	 	a	rock	now	against	the	wall	.
she	 need 	 s 	 	to	give	it	to	us	.
and	she	 get 	 s 	 	cucumber	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	wall	street	protest	that	you	see	here	.
let	me	tell	you	--	i	still	have	two	 minute 	 s 	 	left	,	let	me	tell	you	a	funny	story	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	and	we	got	a	lot	of	 comment 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	,	 economist 	 s 	 	,	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	.
they	did	n't	like	 th 	 is 	 	at	all	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	 decide 	 d 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	that	 fair 	 ness 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	issue	and	that	 animal 	 s 	 	can	not	have	it	.
and	so	one	 philosoph 	 er 	 	even	wrote	us	that	it	was	 im 	 possible 	 	that	 monkey 	 s 	 	had	a	sense	of	 fair 	 ness 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 fair 	 ness 	 	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	french	revolution	.
now	 an 	 other 	 	one	wrote	a	whole	chapter	 say 	 ing 	 	that	he	would	 believ 	 e 	 	it	had	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	 fair 	 ness 	 	if	the	one	who	got	 grape 	 s 	 	would	 re 	 fuse 	 	the	 grape 	 s 	 	.
now	the	funny	thing	is	that	sarah	brosnan	,	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	had	a	couple	of	 combination 	 s 	 	of	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	where	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	one	who	would	get	the	grape	would	 re 	 fuse 	 	the	grape	 un 	 til 	 	the	other	guy	 al 	 so 	 	got	a	grape	.
so	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	the	human	sense	of	 fair 	 ness 	 	.
and	i	think	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	need	to	 re 	 think 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	for	 a 	 while 	 	.
so	let	me	summarize	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	there	's	an	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
i	think	 moral 	 ity 	 	is	much	more	than	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	but	it	would	be	 im 	 possible 	 	 with 	 out 	 	these	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	that	we	find	in	other	 prim 	 ates 	 	,	which	are	 empath 	 y 	 	and	 consol 	 ation 	 	,	pro	-	social	 tend 	 encies 	 	and	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	and	a	sense	of	 fair 	 ness 	 	.
and	so	we	work	on	these	 part 	 icular 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	to	see	if	we	can	create	a	 moral 	 ity 	 	from	the	bottom	up	,	so	to	speak	,	 with 	 out 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	god	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	,	and	to	see	how	we	can	get	to	an	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	thank	you	for	your	attention	.
