my	thing	with	school	lunch	is	,	it	's	a	social	justice	issue	.
i	'm	the	director	of	nutrition	 service 	 s 	 	for	the	berkeley	 un 	 ified 	 	school	 di 	 strict 	 	.	i	have	90	 employ 	 ees 	 	and	17	 location 	 s 	 	,	9,600	 kid 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	7,100	 meal 	 s 	 	a	day	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	change	how	we	feed	 kid 	 s 	 	in	america	.
and	that	's	what	i	want	to	talk	to	you	a	little	bit	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
these	are	some	of	my	 kid 	 s 	 	with	a	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	bar	.
i	put	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	 bar 	 s 	 	in	all	of	our	 school 	 s 	 	when	i	got	there	.
 every 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	it	could	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
little	 kid 	 s 	 	could	n't	eat	off	the	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	bar	,	big	 kid 	 s 	 	would	 s 	 pit 	 	in	it	--	 n 	 either 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
when	i	took	over	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	figure	out	,	like	,	what	my	vision	would	be	.
how	do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	change	children	's	relationship	to	food	?
and	i	'll	tell	you	why	we	need	to	change	it	,	but	we	 absolute 	 ly 	 	have	to	change	it	.
and	what	i	came	to	understand	is	,	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	teach	children	the	 sym 	 biotic 	 	relationship	between	a	 health 	 y 	 	planet	,	 health 	 y 	 	food	and	 health 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	that	if	we	do	n't	do	that	,	the	 anti 	 thesis 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	've	heard	 other 	 wise 	 	,	is	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	extinct	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 feed 	 ing 	 	our	children	to	death	.
that	's	my	 pre 	 mise 	 	.
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	sick	 kid 	 s 	 	get	 sick 	 er 	 	and	 sick 	 er 	 	.
and	the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	by	and	large	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	food	system	and	the	way	the	government	 com 	 modifi 	 es 	 	food	,	the	way	the	government	 over 	 s 	 ees 	 	our	food	,	the	way	the	usda	 put 	 s 	 	food	on	 kid 	 s 	 	'	 plate 	 s 	 	that	's	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	,	and	 allow 	 s 	 	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	food	 in 	 to 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
and	by	--	 tacit 	 ly 	 	,	all	of	us	 s 	 end 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	,	or	 grand 	 children 	 	,	or	 niece 	 s 	 	,	or	 nephew 	 s 	 	,	to	school	and	tell	them	to	learn	,	you	know	,	learn	what	's	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
and	when	you	feed	these	 kid 	 s 	 	bad	food	,	that	's	what	they	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	.	so	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	about	.
the	way	we	got	here	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	big	 agr 	 i 	 business 	 	.
we	now	live	in	a	country	where	most	of	us	do	n't	decide	,	by	and	large	,	what	we	eat	.	we	see	big	 business 	 es 	 	,	monsanto	and	dupont	,	who	 br 	 ought 	 	out	agent	 o 	 range 	 	and	stain	-	resistant	carpet	.
they	control	90	percent	of	the	 commercial 	 ly 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	in	our	country	.
these	are	--	10	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	control	much	of	what	's	in	our	 grocer 	 y 	 	 store 	 s 	 	,	much	of	what	people	eat	.	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	a	problem	.
so	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	these	 issue 	 s 	 	and	how	i	was	going	to	change	what	 kid 	 s 	 	ate	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	what	we	would	teach	them	.
and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	thing	was	about	 region 	 al 	 	food	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	eat	food	from	 with 	 in 	 	our	region	.
and	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	with	what	's	going	on	with	fossil	fuel	 us 	 age 	 	,	or	when	--	 a 	 s 	 	the	fossil	fuel	is	going	away	,	 a 	 s 	 	oil	 hit 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	peak	oil	,	you	know	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	we	should	,	or	could	,	be	moving	food	1,500	 mile 	 s 	 	before	we	eat	it	.
so	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	 kid 	 s 	 	about	that	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	start	to	feed	 kid 	 s 	 	 region 	 al 	 	food	.
and	then	we	talk	about	 organ 	 ic 	 	food	.
now	,	most	school	 di 	 strict 	 s 	 	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	afford	 organ 	 ic 	 	food	,	but	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	nation	,	have	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 consum 	 ing 	 	,	growing	and	 feed 	 ing 	 	our	children	food	that	's	not	chock	-	full	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
we	ca	n't	keep	 feed 	 ing 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	and	 herb 	 icide 	 s 	 	and	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	and	 hormone 	 s 	 	.
we	ca	n't	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
you	know	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
and	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	that	are	 kid 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	sick	.
one	of	my	big	 soap 	 boxes 	 	right	now	is	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.
seventy	percent	of	all	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	 consum 	 ed 	 	in	america	is	 consum 	 ed 	 	in	animal	 husband 	 ry 	 	.
we	are	 feed 	 ing 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	in	beef	and	other	animal	protein	every	day	.
seventy	percent	--	it	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
and	the	result	of	it	is	,	we	have	 disease 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 thing 	 s 	 	like	e.	coli	that	we	ca	n't	fix	,	that	we	ca	n't	make	 kid 	 s 	 	better	when	they	get	sick	.
and	,	you	know	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	over	-	 pre 	 scribed 	 	,	but	it	's	an	issue	in	the	food	supply	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	is	that	u.s.	 agricultur 	 e 	 	uses	1.2	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	of	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	every	year	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	every	one	of	us	,	and	our	children	,	 consum 	 es 	 	what	would	equal	a	five	-	pound	bag	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 bag 	 s 	 	you	have	at	home	.	if	i	had	one	here	and	 rip 	 ped 	 	it	open	,	and	that	pile	i	would	have	on	the	floor	is	what	we	 consum 	 e 	 	and	feed	our	children	every	year	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	food	supply	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	way	we	 consum 	 e 	 	produce	in	america	.
the	usda	 allow 	 s 	 	these	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	,	these	 hormone 	 s 	 	and	these	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	in	our	food	supply	,	and	the	usda	paid	for	 th 	 is 	 	ad	in	time	magazine	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	could	talk	about	rachel	carson	and	ddt	,	but	we	know	it	was	n't	good	for	you	and	me	.
and	that	is	what	the	usda	 allow 	 s 	 	in	our	food	supply	.
and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	change	,	you	know	.
the	usda	can	not	be	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	be	-	all	and	end	-	all	of	what	we	feed	our	 kid 	 s 	 	and	what	's	 allow 	 ed 	 	.
we	can	not	 believ 	 e 	 	that	they	have	our	best	 interest 	 s 	 	at	heart	.
the	 anti 	 thesis 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	is	 sustain 	 able 	 	food	.
that	's	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	try	and	get	people	to	understand	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	try	and	teach	it	to	 kid 	 s 	 	.	i	think	it	's	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	's	 consum 	 ing 	 	food	in	a	way	in	which	we	'll	still	have	a	planet	,	in	which	 kid 	 s 	 	will	grow	up	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	,	and	which	 re 	 ally 	 	tries	to	 mitig 	 ate 	 	all	the	negative	 impact 	 s 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	just	a	new	idea	.
i	mean	,	people	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	around	 sustain 	 ability 	 	,	but	we	have	to	figure	out	what	 sustain 	 ability 	 	is	.
in	less	than	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	just	in	a	few	 generation 	 s 	 	,	we	've	gone	from	 be 	 ing 	 	200	--	 be 	 ing 	 	100	percent	,	95	percent	 farm 	 ers 	 	to	less	than	2	percent	of	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
we	now	live	in	a	country	that	 ha 	 s 	 	more	 prisoner 	 s 	 	than	 farm 	 ers 	 	--	2.1	million	 prisoner 	 s 	 	,	1.9	million	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
and	we	 s 	 pend 	 	35,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	average	a	year	 keep 	 ing 	 	a	prisoner	in	 pri 	 son 	 	,	and	school	 di 	 strict 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	 feed 	 ing 	 	a	child	.
it	's	no	wonder	,	you	know	,	we	have	 criminal 	 s 	 	.
and	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	,	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	sick	.
we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	sick	and	our	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	sick	.
it	is	about	what	we	feed	them	.
what	 go 	 es 	 	in	is	what	we	are	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	what	we	eat	.
and	if	we	 continu 	 e 	 	down	 th 	 is 	 	path	,	if	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	feed	 kid 	 s 	 	bad	food	,	if	we	 continu 	 e 	 	not	to	teach	them	what	good	food	is	,	what	's	going	to	happen	?	you	know	,	what	is	going	to	happen	?
what	's	going	to	happen	to	our	whole	medical	system	?
what	's	going	to	happen	is	,	we	're	going	to	have	 kid 	 s 	 	that	have	a	life	less	long	than	our	own	.
the	cdc	,	the	center	for	disease	control	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	of	the	children	born	in	the	year	2000	--	 t 	 hose 	 	seven	-	and	eight	-	year	-	olds	 to 	 day 	 	--	one	out	of	every	three	caucasians	,	one	out	of	every	two	african	-	americans	and	hispanics	are	going	to	have	diabetes	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 time 	 	.
and	if	that	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	,	they	've	gone	on	to	say	,	most	before	they	graduate	high	school	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	40	or	45	percent	of	all	school	-	aged	children	could	be	insulin	-	dependent	 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	.	 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	.
what	's	going	to	happen	?
well	,	the	cdc	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	further	to	say	that	 t 	 hose 	 	children	born	in	the	year	2000	could	be	the	first	generation	in	our	country	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	to	die	at	a	 young 	 er 	 	age	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	we	feed	them	.
 be 	 cause 	 	eight	-	year	-	olds	do	n't	get	to	decide	--	and	if	they	do	,	you	should	be	in	therapy	.
you	know	,	we	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	what	 kid 	 s 	 	eat	.
but	 oop 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	're	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	what	 kid 	 s 	 	eat	.
big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	20	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	 market 	 ing 	 	non	-	nutrient	 food 	 s 	 	to	 kid 	 s 	 	.
20	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.	10,000	 ad 	 s 	 	most	 kid 	 s 	 	see	.
they	 s 	 pend 	 	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	every	one	dollar	--	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	 market 	 ing 	 	 food 	 s 	 	that	 kid 	 s 	 	should	n't	eat	for	every	one	dollar	 market 	 ing 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	 nut 	 rit 	 ious 	 	food	.
the	result	of	which	is	 kid 	 s 	 	think	they	're	going	to	die	if	they	do	n't	have	chicken	 nugget 	 s 	 	.
you	know	that	 every 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	they	should	be	eating	more	,	and	more	,	and	more	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	usda	 port 	 ion 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	,	that	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	thing	.
and	the	one	over	there	,	that	's	 big 	 ger 	 	than	my	head	,	is	what	mcdonald	's	and	burger	king	and	 t 	 hose 	 	big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	think	we	should	eat	.
and	why	can	they	serve	that	much	?
why	can	we	have	29	-	cent	big	gulps	and	99	-	cent	double	 burger 	 s 	 	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	way	the	government	 com 	 modifi 	 es 	 	food	,	and	the	cheap	corn	and	cheap	 so 	 y 	 	that	are	 push 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	food	supply	that	 make 	 s 	 	these	non	-	nutrient	 food 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	cheap	.
which	is	why	i	say	it	's	a	social	justice	issue	.
now	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	berkeley	,	and	you	might	think	,	``	oh	,	berkeley	.	of	course	you	can	do	it	in	berkeley	.	``
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	food	i	found	24	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	even	food	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	stuff	we	 we 	 re 	 	 feed 	 ing 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	:	extremo	burritos	,	corn	 dog 	 s 	 	,	pizza	 pocket 	 s 	 	,	 grill 	 ed 	 	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	came	in	plastic	,	in	 card 	 board 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	kitchen	 tool 	 s 	 	my	staff	had	was	a	box	cutter	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	piece	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	in	my	kitchen	was	a	can	 crush 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	it	did	n't	come	in	a	can	,	it	came	 froze 	 n 	 	in	a	box	.
the	usda	 allow 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	usda	 allow 	 s 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
in	case	you	ca	n't	tell	,	that	's	,	like	,	pink	danish	and	some	kind	of	 cup 	 cake 	 s 	 	.
chicken	 nugget 	 s 	 	,	tater	tots	,	chocolate	milk	with	high	fructose	,	 can 	 ned 	 	fruit	 cock 	 tail 	 	--	a	 reimburs 	 able 	 	meal	.
that	's	what	the	government	 say 	 s 	 	is	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	feed	our	 kid 	 s 	 	.
it	ai	n't	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	you	know	what	?	it	is	not	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
and	we	,	all	of	us	,	have	to	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	us	,	that	we	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	here	.
now	i	do	n't	know	if	any	of	you	out	there	 invent 	 ed 	 	chicken	 nugget 	 s 	 	,	but	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	're	rich	if	you	did	.
but	 who 	 ever 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	that	a	chicken	should	look	like	a	heart	,	a	giraffe	,	a	star	?
well	,	tyson	did	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	chicken	in	the	chicken	.
and	that	they	could	figure	it	out	,	that	we	could	sell	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	to	 kid 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	what	's	wrong	with	 teach 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	that	chicken	 look 	 s 	 	like	chicken	?
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	most	 school 	 s 	 	serve	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	what	a	lot	of	 parent 	 s 	 	serve	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	try	and	serve	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	change	 th 	 is 	 	whole	paradigm	with	 kid 	 s 	 	and	food	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	teach	children	that	chicken	is	not	a	giraffe	.
you	know	,	that	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 color 	 ful 	 	,	that	they	have	flavor	,	that	 carrot 	 s 	 	grow	in	the	ground	,	that	 straw 	 berries 	 	grow	in	the	ground	.
there	's	not	a	 straw 	 berry 	 	tree	or	a	carrot	bush	.
you	know	,	we	have	to	change	the	way	we	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	lot	of	stuff	we	can	do	.	there	's	a	lot	of	 school 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	farm	-	to	-	school	 program 	 s 	 	.	there	's	a	lot	of	 school 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	fresh	food	 in 	 to 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
now	,	in	berkeley	,	we	've	gone	 total 	 ly 	 	fresh	.
we	have	no	high	-	fructose	corn	syrup	,	no	trans	 fat 	 s 	 	,	no	 process 	 ed 	 	 food 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 cook 	 ing 	 	from	scratch	every	day	.
we	have	25	percent	of	our	--	thank	you	--	25	percent	of	our	stuff	is	 organ 	 ic 	 	and	local	.	we	cook	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.	i	get	up	at	4	a.m	.
every	day	and	go	cook	the	food	for	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	need	to	do	.
we	ca	n't	keep	 serv 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 process 	 ed 	 	crap	,	full	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	and	expect	these	are	going	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
you	're	not	going	to	get	the	next	generation	,	or	the	generation	after	,	to	be	able	to	think	like	 th 	 is 	 	if	they	're	not	 nourish 	 ed 	 	.
if	they	're	eating	 chemical 	 s 	 	all	the	time	,	they	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	think	.
they	're	not	going	to	be	smart	.
you	know	what	?	they	're	just	going	to	be	sick	.
now	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	--	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	berkeley	is	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	all	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	people	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	and	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	market	it	.
i	came	up	with	these	 calendar 	 s 	 	that	i	 s 	 ent 	 	home	to	every	parent	.
and	these	 calendar 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	lay	out	my	program	.
now	i	'm	in	charge	of	all	the	 cook 	 ing 	 	 class 	 es 	 	and	all	the	 garden 	 ing 	 	 class 	 es 	 	in	our	school	 di 	 strict 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	typical	menu	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 serv 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	week	at	the	 school 	 s 	 	.
and	you	see	these	 recipe 	 s 	 	on	the	side	?
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 recipe 	 s 	 	that	the	 kid 	 s 	 	learn	in	my	 cook 	 ing 	 	 class 	 es 	 	.
they	do	 tasting 	 s 	 	of	these	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	in	the	 garden 	 ing 	 	 class 	 es 	 	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	may	be	growing	them	.	and	we	serve	them	in	the	 cafeteria 	 s 	 	.
if	we	're	going	to	change	children	's	relationship	to	food	,	it	's	 delic 	 ious 	 	,	 nut 	 rit 	 ious 	 	food	in	the	 cafeteria 	 s 	 	,	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	experience	--	you	're	looking	in	 cook 	 ing 	 	and	 garden 	 ing 	 	 class 	 es 	 	--	and	academic	curriculum	to	tie	it	all	together	.
now	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 gar 	 ner 	 ed 	 	that	i	do	n't	love	the	usda	,	and	i	do	n't	have	any	idea	what	to	do	with	 the 	 ir 	 	pyramid	,	 th 	 is 	 	 up 	 side 	 	-	down	pyramid	with	a	 rain 	 bow 	 	over	the	top	,	i	do	n't	know	.
you	know	,	run	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	end	of	the	 rain 	 bow 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	what	you	do	with	it	.	so	,	i	came	up	with	my	own	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 avail 	 able 	 	on	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	in	english	and	spanish	,	and	it	's	a	visual	way	to	talk	to	 kid 	 s 	 	about	food	.
the	 re 	 ally 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	 ham 	 burger 	 	,	the	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	start	changing	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	have	to	make	 kid 	 s 	 	understand	that	 the 	 ir 	 	food	 choice 	 s 	 	make	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
we	have	 cook 	 ing 	 	 class 	 es 	 	--	we	have	 cook 	 ing 	 	 class 	 rooms 	 	in	our	 school 	 s 	 	.
and	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	we	now	have	grown	a	generation	,	 may 	 be 	 	two	,	of	 kid 	 s 	 	where	one	out	of	every	four	 meal 	 s 	 	is	eaten	in	fast	food	,	one	of	every	four	 meal 	 s 	 	is	eaten	in	a	car	and	one	out	of	every	last	four	 meal 	 s 	 	is	eaten	in	front	of	a	tv	or	computer	.
what	are	 kid 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	?	where	is	the	family	time	?
where	is	 social 	 ization 	 	?	where	is	 discuss 	 ion 	 	?
where	is	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	talk	?
you	know	,	we	have	to	change	it	.
i	work	with	 kid 	 s 	 	a	lot	.	these	are	 kid 	 s 	 	i	work	with	in	harlem	.
eatwise	--	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	and	aware	 teen 	 s 	 	who	inspire	smart	eating	.
we	have	to	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	that	 co 	 ke 	 	and	pop	 tart 	 s 	 	are	n't	 break 	 fast 	 	.
we	have	to	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	that	if	they	're	on	a	diet	of	 refine 	 d 	 	sugar	,	they	go	up	and	down	,	just	like	if	they	're	on	a	diet	of	crack	.
and	we	have	to	pull	it	all	together	.	we	have	 com 	 post 	 ing 	 	in	all	of	our	 school 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 recycl 	 ing 	 	in	all	of	our	 school 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	 may 	 be 	 	do	at	home	and	think	are	so	 import 	 ant 	 	,	we	have	to	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	about	in	school	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	so	much	a	part	of	them	that	they	 re 	 ally 	 	get	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	what	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	are	sort	of	at	the	end	of	our	 care 	 ers 	 	,	and	we	need	to	be	giving	these	 kid 	 s 	 	--	these	young	 kid 	 s 	 	,	the	next	generation	--	the	 tool 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 s 	 ave 	 	the	planet	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	do	a	lot	is	public	-	private	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	.
i	work	with	private	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	who	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	do	r	&	d	with	me	,	who	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	do	 distribut 	 ion 	 	for	me	,	who	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	work	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
 school 	 s 	 	are	 under 	 funded 	 	.
most	 school 	 s 	 	in	america	 s 	 pend 	 	less	than	7,500	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	 teach 	 ing 	 	a	child	.
that	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	under	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
most	of	you	 s 	 pend 	 	10	,	15	 dollar 	 s 	 	an	hour	for	 babysitter 	 s 	 	when	you	have	them	.
so	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	less	than	5	 dollar 	 s 	 	an	hour	on	the	 education 	 al 	 	system	.
and	if	we	're	going	to	change	it	,	and	change	how	we	feed	 kid 	 s 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	 re 	 think 	 	that	.
so	,	public	and	private	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	 advoc 	 acy 	 	 group 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 found 	 ations 	 	.
in	our	school	 di 	 strict 	 	,	the	way	we	afford	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	school	 di 	 strict 	 	 al 	 locate 	 s 	 	.03	percent	of	the	general	fund	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	nutrition	 service 	 s 	 	.	and	i	think	if	every	school	 di 	 strict 	 	 al 	 locate 	 d 	 	a	half	to	one	percent	,	we	could	start	to	 re 	 ally 	 	fix	 th 	 is 	 	program	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	change	it	.
it	's	going	to	take	more	money	.
of	course	,	it	's	not	all	about	food	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	about	 kid 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
and	one	of	the	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	do	is	put	recess	before	lunch	.
it	's	sort	of	 th 	 is 	 	``	 d 	 uh 	 	``	thing	.
you	know	,	if	you	have	 kid 	 s 	 	coming	 in 	 to 	 	lunch	and	all	they	're	going	to	do	when	they	get	out	of	lunch	is	go	to	have	recess	,	you	see	them	just	throw	away	 the 	 ir 	 	lunch	so	they	can	run	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	then	,	at	one	in	the	afternoon	,	they	're	 total 	 ly 	 	 crash 	 ing 	 	.
these	are	your	children	and	 grand 	 children 	 	that	are	 total 	 ly 	 	 melt 	 ing 	 	down	when	you	pick	them	up	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	n't	had	lunch	.
so	if	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	they	'd	have	to	do	after	lunch	is	go	to	class	,	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	they	're	going	to	 s 	 it 	 	there	and	eat	 the 	 ir 	 	lunch	.
we	need	to	--	we	need	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	.
we	need	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	the	staff	.
i	had	90	 employ 	 ees 	 	.
two	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 cook 	 s 	 	--	 non 	 e 	 	could	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	'm	not	that	better	off	now	.
but	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	.
we	have	to	get	academic	 institution 	 s 	 	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	ways	to	teach	people	how	to	cook	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	they	do	n't	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	had	 th 	 is 	 	 process 	 ed 	 	food	in	 school 	 s 	 	and	 institution 	 s 	 	for	so	long	.
we	need	40	-	minute	 lunch 	 es 	 	--	most	 school 	 s 	 	have	20	-	minute	 lunch 	 es 	 	--	and	 lunch 	 es 	 	that	are	time	-	appropriate	.
there	was	just	a	big	 stud 	 y 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	so	 man 	 y 	 	 school 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	lunch	at	nine	and	10	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
that	is	not	 lunch 	 time 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	crazy	.	it	's	crazy	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	just	remember	,	at	 ver 	 y 	 	 l 	 east 	 	 tacit 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 teach 	 ing 	 	children	 a 	 s 	 	what	they	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	.
i	think	if	we	're	going	to	fix	 th 	 is 	 	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	have	to	do	is	 re 	 ally 	 	change	how	we	have	 over 	 sight 	 	over	the	national	school	lunch	program	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	national	school	lunch	program	 be 	 ing 	 	under	the	usda	,	i	think	it	should	be	under	cdc	.
if	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	food	and	how	we	feed	our	 kid 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	health	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	food	 a 	 s 	 	health	,	then	i	think	we	would	n't	have	corn	 dog 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	lunch	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	finance	101	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	'm	sort	of	 wrap 	 ping 	 	it	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	finance	piece	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	all	have	to	understand	.
the	national	school	lunch	program	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	8	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	 feed 	 ing 	 	30	million	children	a	year	.
that	number	 prob 	 ably 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	double	.
people	say	,	``	oh	my	god	,	where	are	we	going	to	get	8	billion	?	``
in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	110	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	on	fast	food	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	100	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	on	diet	 aid 	 s 	 	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	50	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	,	which	is	why	we	need	all	the	diet	 aid 	 s 	 	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	200	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	on	diet	-	related	 ill 	 ness 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	with	nine	percent	of	our	 kid 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	type	2	diabetes	.
200	billion	.
so	you	know	what	,	when	we	talk	about	 need 	 ing 	 	8	billion	more	,	it	's	not	a	lot	.
that	8	billion	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	49	 cent 	 s 	 	--	that	's	what	the	government	 al 	 locate 	 s 	 	for	lunch	.
most	school	 di 	 strict 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	two	 third 	 s 	 	of	that	on	 pay 	 roll 	 	and	 over 	 head 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	 s 	 pend 	 	less	than	a	dollar	a	day	on	food	for	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	--	most	 school 	 s 	 	,	80	to	90	 cent 	 s 	 	.	in	l.a.	,	it	's	56	 cent 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	less	than	a	dollar	,	ok	,	on	lunch	.
now	i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	i	go	to	starbucks	and	pete	's	and	 place 	 s 	 	like	that	,	and	 vent 	 i 	 	latte	in	san	francisco	is	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
one	gourmet	coffee	,	one	,	is	more	--	we	 s 	 pend 	 	more	on	than	we	are	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	to	feed	 kid 	 s 	 	for	an	entire	week	in	our	 school 	 s 	 	.
you	know	what	?	we	should	be	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	.
we	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	,	should	be	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	at	that	.
the	 rich 	 est 	 	country	.
in	our	country	,	it	's	the	 kid 	 s 	 	that	need	it	the	most	,	who	get	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 lous 	 y 	 	food	.
it	's	the	 kid 	 s 	 	who	have	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 uncle 	 s 	 	and	 aunt 	 s 	 	that	ca	n't	even	afford	to	pay	for	school	lunch	that	 get 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	food	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	same	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	going	to	be	 get 	 ting 	 	sick	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	same	 kid 	 s 	 	who	we	should	be	taking	care	of	.
we	can	all	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
that	every	single	one	of	us	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	have	children	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	care	about	children	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	have	 niece 	 s 	 	or	 nephew 	 s 	 	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	--	that	we	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	and	eat	a	meal	with	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	take	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	or	 grand 	 children 	 	,	or	 niece 	 s 	 	and	 nephew 	 s 	 	 shop 	 ping 	 	to	a	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	market	.	just	do	 tasting 	 s 	 	with	them	.
 s 	 it 	 	down	and	care	.
and	on	the	macro	level	,	we	're	in	what	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	a	19	-	month	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	campaign	,	and	of	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	all	of	these	potential	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	what	about	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	the	health	of	our	children	?
thank	you	.
