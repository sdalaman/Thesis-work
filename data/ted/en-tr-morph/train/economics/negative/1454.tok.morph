 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	beloit	,	wisconsin	.
and	i	was	there	to	honor	a	great	20th	century	 explore 	 r 	 	,	roy	chapman	andrews	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	his	time	at	the	american	museum	of	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	andrews	led	a	range	of	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	to	 un 	 chart 	 ed 	 	 region 	 s 	 	,	like	here	in	the	gobi	desert	.
he	was	 quit 	 e 	 	a	figure	.
he	was	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	's	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	the	indiana	jones	character	.
and	when	i	was	in	beloit	,	wisconsin	,	i	 g 	 ave 	 	a	public	 lectur 	 e 	 	to	a	group	of	middle	school	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	,	if	there	's	 any 	 thing 	 	more	 intimid 	 ating 	 	than	 talk 	 ing 	 	here	at	ted	,	it	'll	be	 try 	 ing 	 	to	hold	the	attention	of	a	group	of	a	thousand	12	-	year	-	olds	for	a	45	-	minute	 lectur 	 e 	 	.
do	n't	try	that	one	.
at	the	end	of	the	 lectur 	 e 	 	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	number	of	 question 	 s 	 	,	but	there	was	one	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	me	since	then	.
there	was	a	young	girl	who	stood	up	,	and	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	:	``	where	should	we	explore	?	``
i	think	there	's	a	sense	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	have	that	the	great	age	of	exploration	on	earth	is	over	,	that	for	the	next	generation	they	're	going	to	have	to	go	to	 out 	 er 	 	space	or	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 ocean 	 s 	 	in	order	to	find	 some 	 thing 	 	significant	to	explore	.
but	is	that	 re 	 ally 	 	the	case	?
is	there	 re 	 ally 	 	 no 	 where 	 	significant	for	us	to	explore	left	here	on	earth	?
it	sort	of	made	me	think	back	to	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 explore 	 rs 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	biology	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 explore 	 r 	 	of	the	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	world	,	martinus	beijerinck	.
so	beijerinck	set	out	to	discover	the	cause	of	tobacco	mosaic	disease	.
what	he	did	is	he	took	the	 infect 	 ed 	 	juice	from	tobacco	 plant 	 s 	 	and	he	would	filter	it	through	 small 	 er 	 	and	 small 	 er 	 	 filter 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	point	where	he	felt	that	there	must	be	 some 	 thing 	 	out	there	that	was	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	 small 	 est 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	life	that	 we 	 re 	 	ever	known	--	bacteria	,	at	the	time	.
he	came	up	with	a	name	for	his	 myster 	 y 	 	agent	.
he	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	virus	--	latin	for	``	poison	.	``
and	in	 un 	 cover 	 ing 	 	viruses	,	beijerinck	 re 	 ally 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	world	for	us	.
we	now	know	that	viruses	make	up	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	genetic	information	on	our	planet	,	more	than	the	genetic	information	of	all	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	life	 combine 	 d 	 	.
and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	tremendous	practical	 application 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	world	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	 eradic 	 ation 	 	of	 small 	 pox 	 	,	the	 ad 	 vent 	 	of	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	against	 cerv 	 ical 	 	cancer	,	which	we	now	know	is	 most 	 ly 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	human	 papilloma 	 virus 	 	.
and	beijerinck	's	 discover 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 occur 	 red 	 	500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	was	a	little	over	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	beijerinck	 discover 	 ed 	 	viruses	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	we	had	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	,	but	we	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 aware 	 	of	the	 form 	 s 	 	of	life	that	make	up	most	of	the	genetic	information	on	our	planet	.
we	now	have	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	to	allow	us	to	explore	the	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	world	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	deep	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	,	which	allow	us	to	do	much	more	than	just	skim	the	surface	and	look	at	individual	 genome 	 s 	 	from	a	 part 	 icular 	 	species	,	but	to	look	at	entire	 meta 	 genome 	 s 	 	,	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	 tee 	 ming 	 	 micro 	 organism 	 s 	 	in	,	on	and	around	us	and	to	document	all	of	the	genetic	information	in	these	species	.
we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	these	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	 thing 	 s 	 	from	 s 	 oil 	 	to	skin	and	 every 	 thing 	 	in	between	.
in	my	 organ 	 ization 	 	we	now	do	 th 	 is 	 	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	to	identify	the	 cause 	 s 	 	of	 out 	 break 	 s 	 	that	are	 un 	 clear 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 cause 	 s 	 	them	.
and	just	to	give	you	a	sense	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	imagine	that	we	took	a	 na 	 s 	 al 	 	swab	from	every	single	one	of	you	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	 common 	 ly 	 	do	to	look	for	 respirator 	 y 	 	viruses	like	influenza	.
the	first	thing	we	would	see	is	a	tremendous	amount	of	genetic	information	.
and	if	we	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	 in 	 to 	 	that	genetic	information	,	we	'd	see	a	number	of	usual	 suspect 	 s 	 	out	there	--	of	course	,	a	lot	of	human	genetic	information	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	bacterial	and	viral	information	,	 most 	 ly 	 	from	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 harm 	 less 	 	 with 	 in 	 	your	nose	.
but	we	'd	 al 	 so 	 	see	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	we	would	see	that	about	20	percent	of	the	genetic	information	in	your	nose	 do 	 es 	 	n't	match	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	before	--	no	plant	,	animal	,	fungus	,	virus	or	bacteria	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	we	have	no	clue	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
and	for	the	small	group	of	us	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	data	,	a	few	of	us	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	to	call	 th 	 is 	 	information	 bio 	 logical 	 	dark	matter	.
we	know	it	's	not	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	before	;	it	's	sort	of	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	an	 un 	 chart 	 ed 	 	continent	right	 with 	 in 	 	our	own	genetic	information	.
and	there	's	a	lot	of	it	.
if	you	think	20	percent	of	genetic	information	in	your	nose	is	a	lot	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	dark	matter	,	if	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	your	gut	,	up	to	40	or	50	percent	of	that	information	is	 bio 	 logical 	 	dark	matter	.
and	even	in	the	 relat 	 ively 	 	 steril 	 e 	 	blood	,	around	one	to	two	percent	of	 th 	 is 	 	information	is	dark	matter	--	ca	n't	be	 class 	 ified 	 	,	ca	n't	be	 type 	 d 	 	or	 match 	 ed 	 	with	 any 	 thing 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
at	first	we	thought	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	artifact	.
these	deep	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	are	 relat 	 ively 	 	new	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	they	 be 	 come 	 	more	and	more	accurate	,	we	've	 determine 	 d 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	information	is	a	form	of	life	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	some	of	it	is	a	form	of	life	.
and	while	the	 hypo 	 these 	 s 	 	for	 explain 	 ing 	 	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	dark	matter	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 inf 	 ancy 	 	,	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	 exist 	 s 	 	:	that	buried	in	 th 	 is 	 	life	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	genetic	information	,	are	 signature 	 s 	 	of	 a 	 s 	 	of	yet	 un 	 identified 	 	life	.
that	 a 	 s 	 	we	explore	these	 string 	 s 	 	of	a	's	,	t	's	,	c	's	and	g	's	,	we	may	 un 	 cover 	 	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	class	of	life	that	,	like	beijerinck	,	will	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	change	the	way	that	we	think	about	the	nature	of	biology	.
that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	will	allow	us	to	identify	the	cause	of	a	cancer	that	 affli 	 ct 	 s 	 	us	or	identify	the	source	of	an	 out 	 break 	 	that	we	are	n't	familiar	with	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	create	a	new	tool	in	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	.
i	'm	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	announce	that	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	at	stanford	and	caltech	and	ucsf	,	we	're	 current 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	an	 initi 	 ative 	 	to	explore	 bio 	 logical 	 	dark	matter	for	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	life	.
a	little	over	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 aware 	 	of	viruses	,	the	 form 	 s 	 	of	life	that	make	up	most	of	the	genetic	information	on	our	planet	.
a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	people	may	marvel	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 aware 	 	of	a	new	class	of	life	that	 liter 	 ally 	 	was	right	under	our	 nose 	 s 	 	.
it	's	true	,	we	may	have	 chart 	 ed 	 	all	the	 continent 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	and	we	may	have	 discover 	 ed 	 	all	the	 mammal 	 s 	 	that	are	out	there	,	but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	left	to	explore	on	earth	.
beijerinck	and	his	kind	provide	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 	for	the	next	generation	of	 explore 	 rs 	 	--	people	like	that	young	girl	from	beloit	,	wisconsin	.
and	i	think	if	we	phrase	that	 less 	 on 	 	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	do	n't	 assum 	 e 	 	that	what	we	 current 	 ly 	 	think	is	out	there	is	the	full	story	.
go	after	the	dark	matter	in	 what 	 ever 	 	field	you	 choos 	 e 	 	to	explore	.
there	are	 un 	 known 	 s 	 	all	around	us	and	they	're	just	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	be	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
thank	you	.
