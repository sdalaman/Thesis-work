i	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	my	own	definition	of	success	in	1934	,	when	i	was	 teach 	 ing 	 	at	a	high	school	in	south	bend	,	indiana	,	 be 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	,	and	 delusion 	 ed 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	 parent 	 s 	 	of	the	 young 	 sters 	 	in	my	english	 class 	 es 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 young 	 sters 	 	to	get	an	a	or	a	b.	they	thought	a	c	was	all	right	for	the	 neighbor 	 s 	 	'	children	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 neighbor 	 s 	 	children	are	all	average	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	satisfied	when	 the 	 ir 	 	own	--	would	make	the	teacher	feel	that	they	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	,	or	the	 young 	 ster 	 	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	's	not	right	.	the	good	lord	in	his	infinite	 wis 	 dom 	 	did	n't	create	us	all	equal	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	is	 concern 	 ed 	 	,	any	more	than	we	're	equal	for	 s 	 ize 	 	,	 appear 	 ance 	 	.
not	 every 	 body 	 	could	earn	an	a	or	a	b	,	and	i	did	n't	like	that	way	of	 judg 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	i	did	know	how	the	 al 	 um 	 ni 	 	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	 school 	 s 	 	back	in	the	30s	 judg 	 ed 	 	 coach 	 es 	 	and	athletic	 team 	 s 	 	.
if	you	won	them	all	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	to	be	 reason 	 ably 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	--	not	 complete 	 ly 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	i	found	out	--	we	had	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	at	ucla	where	we	did	n't	lose	a	game	.
but	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	that	we	did	n't	win	each	individual	game	by	the	margin	that	some	of	our	 al 	 um 	 ni 	 	had	 predict 	 ed 	 	and	 quit 	 e 	 	 frequent 	 ly 	 	i	--	--	 quit 	 e 	 	 frequent 	 ly 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	that	they	had	 back 	 ed 	 	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	in	a	more	 material 	 istic 	 	manner	.
but	that	was	true	back	in	the	30s	,	so	i	 under 	 stood 	 	that	.
but	i	did	n't	like	it	.	and	i	did	n't	agree	with	it	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	 hop 	 ed 	 	could	make	me	a	better	teacher	,	and	give	the	 young 	 sters 	 	under	my	 super 	 vision 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	in	 athletic 	 s 	 	or	in	the	english	 class 	 room 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	to	which	to	 aspir 	 e 	 	,	other	than	just	a	 high 	 er 	 	mark	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	or	more	 point 	 s 	 	in	some	athletic	contest	.
i	thought	about	that	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	spell	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	come	up	with	my	own	definition	.	i	thought	that	might	help	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	how	mr.	webster	defined	it	:	 a 	 s 	 	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	material	 possess 	 ions 	 	or	the	 attain 	 ment 	 	of	a	position	of	power	or	 pre 	 stig 	 e 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	of	that	sort	--	worthy	 accomplish 	 ments 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	but	in	my	opinion	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	 indic 	 ative 	 	of	success	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	of	my	own	.
and	i	 recall 	 ed 	 	--	i	was	raised	on	a	small	farm	in	southern	indiana	and	dad	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	teach	me	and	my	 brother 	 s 	 	that	you	should	never	try	to	be	better	than	 some 	 one 	 	else	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	at	the	time	he	did	that	,	i	did	n't	--	it	did	n't	--	well	,	 some 	 where 	 	,	i	guess	in	the	 hid 	 den 	 	 recess 	 es 	 	of	mind	,	it	 pop 	 ped 	 	out	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
never	try	to	be	better	than	 some 	 one 	 	else	,	 al 	 ways 	 	learn	from	 other 	 s 	 	.	never	cease	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	the	best	you	can	be	--	that	's	under	your	control	.
if	you	get	too	 en 	 gross 	 ed 	 	and	 involve 	 d 	 	and	 concern 	 ed 	 	in	regard	to	the	 thing 	 s 	 	over	which	you	have	no	control	,	it	will	 advers 	 e 	 ly 	 	affect	the	 thing 	 s 	 	over	which	you	have	control	.
then	i	ran	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	simple	verse	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	at	god	's	 foot 	 s 	 tool 	 	to	confess	,	a	poor	soul	knelt	,	and	 bow 	 ed 	 	his	head	.
'	i	 fail 	 ed 	 	!	'	he	 cri 	 ed 	 	.
the	master	 s 	 aid 	 	,	'	 th 	 ou 	 	 did 	 st 	 	thy	best	,	that	is	success	.	'	``	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	one	other	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	i	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	my	own	definition	of	success	,	which	is	:	peace	of	mind	 attain 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	through	self	-	satisfaction	in	 know 	 ing 	 	you	made	the	effort	to	do	the	best	of	which	you	're	 cap 	 able 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	's	true	.	if	you	make	the	effort	to	do	the	best	of	which	you	're	 cap 	 able 	 	,	to	try	and	improve	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	 exist 	 s 	 	for	you	,	i	think	that	's	success	.
and	i	do	n't	think	 other 	 s 	 	can	 judg 	 e 	 	that	.	i	think	it	's	like	character	and	reputation	.
your	reputation	is	what	you	are	 perceive 	 d 	 	to	be	;	your	character	is	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	are	.
and	i	think	that	character	is	much	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	what	you	are	 perceive 	 d 	 	to	be	.
you	'd	hope	they	'd	both	be	good	,	but	they	wo	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	be	the	same	.
well	,	that	was	my	idea	that	i	was	going	to	try	to	get	 a 	 cross 	 	to	the	 young 	 sters 	 	.
i	ran	 a 	 cross 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.	i	love	to	teach	,	and	it	was	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	by	the	previous	speaker	that	i	enjoy	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	and	i	 da 	 bble 	 	in	it	a	bit	,	and	love	it	.
there	are	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 help 	 ed 	 	me	,	i	think	,	be	better	than	i	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	.	i	know	i	'm	not	what	i	ought	to	be	,	not	what	i	should	be	.	but	i	think	i	'm	better	than	i	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	if	i	had	n't	run	 a 	 cross 	 	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	was	just	a	little	verse	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	written	word	,	no	spoken	 ple 	 a 	 	can	teach	our	youth	what	they	should	be	.
nor	all	the	 book 	 s 	 	on	all	the	 shelv 	 es 	 	--	it	's	what	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	``
that	made	an	impression	on	me	in	the	1930s	.
and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	use	that	more	or	less	in	my	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	in	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	in	the	english	 class 	 room 	 	.
i	love	 poet 	 ry 	 	and	 al 	 ways 	 	had	an	interest	in	that	 some 	 how 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	dad	used	to	read	to	us	at	night	.
coal	oil	lamp	--	we	did	n't	have	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	our	farm	home	.
and	dad	would	read	 poet 	 ry 	 	to	us	.	so	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 like 	 d 	 	it	.
and	about	the	same	time	i	ran	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	verse	,	i	ran	 a 	 cross 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	.	 some 	 one 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	 lad 	 y 	 	teacher	why	she	taught	.
and	she	--	after	some	time	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	that	.
then	she	came	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	they	ask	me	why	i	teach	and	i	 re 	 ply 	 	,	'	where	could	i	find	 s 	 uch 	 	splendid	company	?	'	there	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	a	 state 	 s 	 man 	 	,	strong	,	 un 	 bias 	 ed 	 	,	wise	;	 an 	 other 	 	daniel	webster	,	silver	-	tongued	.
a	doctor	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	 be 	 side 	 	him	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	quick	 stead 	 y 	 	hand	may	 men 	 d 	 	a	bone	,	or	stem	the	life	-	blood	's	flow	.
and	there	a	 build 	 er 	 	.	 up 	 ward 	 	rise	the	arch	of	a	church	he	 build 	 s 	 	,	 where 	 in 	 	that	 mini 	 ster 	 	may	speak	the	word	of	god	and	lead	a	 s 	 tumbling 	 	soul	to	touch	the	christ	.
and	all	about	a	 gather 	 ing 	 	of	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	 merchan 	 ts 	 	,	 labor 	 ers 	 	:	 t 	 hose 	 	who	work	and	vote	and	build	and	plan	and	pray	 in 	 to 	 	a	great	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
and	i	may	say	,	i	may	not	see	the	church	,	or	hear	the	word	or	eat	the	food	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	may	grow	.
but	yet	 aga 	 in 	 	i	may	.	and	 lat 	 er 	 	i	may	say	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	him	once	,	and	he	was	weak	,	or	strong	,	or	bold	or	proud	or	 ga 	 y 	 	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	him	once	,	but	then	he	was	a	boy	.
they	ask	me	why	i	teach	and	i	 re 	 ply 	 	,	'	where	could	i	find	 s 	 uch 	 	splendid	company	?	'	``	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	the	 teach 	 ing 	 	profession	--	it	's	true	,	you	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	 young 	 sters 	 	.
and	i	've	got	to	think	of	my	 young 	 sters 	 	at	ucla	--	30	-	some	 attorney 	 s 	 	,	11	 dent 	 ists 	 	and	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	other	 profession 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	great	deal	of	pleasure	,	to	see	them	go	on	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	the	 young 	 sters 	 	feel	that	they	're	there	to	get	an	education	,	number	one	.
 basket 	 ball 	 	was	second	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 pay 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	way	,	and	they	do	need	a	little	time	for	social	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	but	you	let	social	 activ 	 ities 	 	take	a	little	 precede 	 nce 	 	over	the	other	two	and	you	're	not	going	to	have	any	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.
so	that	was	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	 a 	 cross 	 	to	the	 young 	 sters 	 	under	my	 super 	 vision 	 	.
i	had	three	 rule 	 s 	 	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	,	that	i	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	 practical 	 ly 	 	all	the	time	.
i	'd	 learn 	 ed 	 	these	prior	to	coming	to	ucla	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
one	was	--	never	be	late	.	never	be	late	.
 lat 	 er 	 	on	i	 s 	 aid 	 	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	--	i	had	--	 player 	 s 	 	,	if	we	're	 leav 	 ing 	 	for	 some 	 where 	 	,	had	to	be	neat	and	clean	.
there	was	a	time	when	i	made	them	wear	 jacket 	 s 	 	and	 shirt 	 s 	 	and	ties	.
then	i	saw	our	 chan 	 cell 	 or 	 	coming	to	school	in	 den 	 im 	 s 	 	and	 turtle 	 neck 	 s 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	not	right	for	me	to	keep	 th 	 is 	 	other	.
so	i	let	them	--	just	they	had	to	be	neat	and	clean	.
i	had	one	of	my	 great 	 est 	 	 player 	 s 	 	that	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	of	,	bill	walton	.	he	came	to	catch	the	bus	;	we	 we 	 re 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	for	 some 	 where 	 	to	play	.
and	he	was	n't	clean	and	neat	,	so	i	would	n't	let	him	go	.
he	could	n't	get	on	the	bus	.	he	had	to	go	home	and	get	 clean 	 ed 	 	up	to	get	to	the	 air 	 port 	 	.
so	i	was	a	 stick 	 ler 	 	for	that	.	i	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	that	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	time	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	you	should	be	on	time	.	but	i	felt	at	practice	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	start	on	time	,	we	close	on	time	.
the	 young 	 sters 	 	did	n't	have	to	feel	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	keep	them	over	.
when	i	speak	at	 coach 	 ing 	 	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	i	often	tell	young	 coach 	 es 	 	--	and	at	 coach 	 ing 	 	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	more	or	less	,	they	'll	be	the	 young 	 er 	 	 coach 	 es 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	in	the	profession	.
most	of	them	are	young	,	you	know	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	 new 	 ly 	 	married	.
and	i	tell	them	,	``	do	n't	run	 practice 	 s 	 	late	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	'll	go	home	in	a	bad	mood	.
and	that	's	not	good	,	for	a	young	married	man	to	go	home	in	a	bad	mood	.
when	you	get	 old 	 er 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	.	``	but	--	so	i	did	 believ 	 e 	 	on	time	.	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	on	time	,	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	on	time	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	one	i	had	was	,	not	one	word	of	 profan 	 ity 	 	.
one	word	of	 profan 	 ity 	 	,	and	you	are	out	of	here	for	the	day	.
if	i	see	it	in	a	game	,	you	're	going	to	come	out	and	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	bench	.
and	the	third	one	was	,	never	 critic 	 ize 	 	a	 team 	 mate 	 	.
i	did	n't	want	that	.	i	used	to	tell	them	i	was	paid	to	do	that	.
that	's	my	job	.	i	'm	paid	to	do	it	.	 pit 	 i 	 fully 	 	poor	,	but	i	am	paid	to	do	it	.
not	like	the	 coach 	 es 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	for	 gr 	 acious 	 	 sake 	 s 	 	,	no	.
it	's	a	little	different	than	it	was	in	my	day	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	 pre 	 tty 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	all	the	time	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	came	from	my	dad	.
that	's	what	he	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	teach	me	and	my	 brother 	 s 	 	at	one	time	.
i	came	up	with	a	pyramid	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	that	i	do	n't	have	the	time	to	go	on	that	.
but	that	 help 	 ed 	 	me	,	i	think	,	 be 	 come 	 	a	better	teacher	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	and	i	had	 block 	 s 	 	in	the	pyramid	,	and	the	 corner 	 stone 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 industrious 	 ness 	 	and	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	hard	and	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	coming	up	to	the	 ap 	 ex 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	my	definition	of	success	.
and	right	at	the	top	--	faith	and	patience	.
and	i	say	to	you	,	in	 what 	 ever 	 	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	you	must	be	patient	.	you	have	to	have	patience	to	--	we	want	 thing 	 s 	 	to	happen	.	we	talk	about	our	youth	 be 	 ing 	 	 im 	 patient 	 	a	lot	.
and	they	are	.	they	want	to	change	 every 	 thing 	 	.
they	think	all	change	is	progress	.
and	we	get	a	little	 old 	 er 	 	--	we	sort	of	let	 thing 	 s 	 	go	.
and	we	forget	there	is	no	progress	 with 	 out 	 	change	.
so	you	must	have	patience	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	must	have	faith	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	must	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	.	not	just	give	it	word	service	;	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 thing 	 s 	 	will	work	out	 a 	 s 	 	they	should	,	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	we	do	what	we	should	.
i	think	our	 tend 	 ency 	 	is	to	hope	that	 thing 	 s 	 	will	turn	out	the	way	we	want	them	to	much	of	the	time	.	but	we	do	n't	do	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	for	some	14	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	it	 help 	 ed 	 	me	 be 	 come 	 	a	better	teacher	.
but	it	all	 r 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	around	that	original	definition	of	success	.
you	know	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	was	a	major	league	 base 	 ball 	 	 ump 	 i 	 re 	 	by	the	name	of	george	moriarty	.
he	 spell 	 ed 	 	moriarty	with	 on 	 ly 	 	one	'	i	'	.
i	'd	never	 s 	 een 	 	that	before	,	but	he	did	.
big	league	 base 	 ball 	 	 player 	 s 	 	--	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	perceptive	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 notice 	 d 	 	he	had	 on 	 ly 	 	one	'	i	'	in	his	name	.
you	'd	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	 al 	 so 	 	told	him	that	that	was	one	more	than	he	had	in	his	head	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
but	he	wrote	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	think	he	did	while	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	in	 th 	 is 	 	pyramid	.	he	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	the	road	 a 	 head 	 	,	or	the	road	 be 	 hind 	 	.	``
``	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	think	the	 fate 	 s 	 	must	grin	 a 	 s 	 	we	 den 	 ounce 	 	them	and	insist	the	 on 	 ly 	 	reason	we	ca	n't	win	,	is	the	 fate 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	 mis 	 s 	 	.
yet	there	 live 	 s 	 	on	the	ancient	claim	:	we	win	or	lose	 with 	 in 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	the	 shin 	 ing 	 	 trop 	 hi 	 es 	 	on	our	 shelv 	 es 	 	can	never	win	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	's	game	.
you	and	i	know	 deep 	 er 	 	down	,	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	a	chance	to	win	the	crown	.
but	when	we	fail	to	give	our	best	,	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	have	n't	met	the	test	,	of	giving	all	and	saving	 non 	 e 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	game	is	 re 	 ally 	 	won	;	of	 show 	 ing 	 	what	is	 me 	 ant 	 	by	grit	;	of	 play 	 ing 	 	through	when	 other 	 s 	 	quit	;	of	 play 	 ing 	 	through	,	not	 lett 	 ing 	 	up	.
it	's	 bear 	 ing 	 	down	that	 win 	 s 	 	the	cup	.	of	 dream 	 ing 	 	there	's	a	goal	 a 	 head 	 	;	of	 hop 	 ing 	 	when	our	 dream 	 s 	 	are	dead	;	of	 pray 	 ing 	 	when	our	 hope 	 s 	 	have	 fl 	 ed 	 	.
yet	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	not	 af 	 raid 	 	to	fall	,	if	 brave 	 ly 	 	we	have	 give 	 n 	 	all	.	for	who	can	ask	more	of	a	man	than	giving	all	 with 	 in 	 	his	span	.
giving	all	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	is	not	so	far	from	 vict 	 ory 	 	.
and	so	the	 fate 	 s 	 	are	seldom	wrong	,	no	matter	how	they	twist	and	wind	.
it	's	you	and	i	who	make	our	 fate 	 s 	 	--	we	open	up	or	close	the	 gate 	 s 	 	on	the	road	 a 	 head 	 	or	the	road	 be 	 hind 	 	.	``
 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	 an 	 other 	 	set	of	 three 	 s 	 	that	my	dad	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	 a 	 cross 	 	to	us	.
do	n't	 whin 	 e 	 	.	do	n't	complain	.	do	n't	make	 excuse 	 s 	 	.
just	get	out	there	,	and	 what 	 ever 	 	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	do	it	to	the	best	of	your	ability	.
and	no	one	can	do	more	than	that	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	 a 	 cross 	 	,	too	,	that	--	my	 opponent 	 s 	 	do	n't	tell	you	--	you	never	heard	me	 ment 	 ion 	 	winning	.
never	 ment 	 ion 	 	winning	.	my	idea	is	that	you	can	lose	when	you	 out 	 score 	 	 some 	 body 	 	in	a	game	.
and	you	can	win	when	you	're	 out 	 score 	 d 	 	.
i	've	felt	that	way	on	certain	 occasion 	 s 	 	,	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	them	to	be	able	to	hold	 the 	 ir 	 	head	up	after	a	game	.
i	used	to	say	that	when	a	game	is	over	,	and	you	see	 some 	 body 	 	that	did	n't	know	the	 out 	 come 	 	,	i	hope	they	could	n't	tell	by	your	 action 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	you	 out 	 score 	 d 	 	an	opponent	or	the	opponent	 out 	 score 	 d 	 	you	.
that	's	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	:	if	you	make	effort	to	do	the	best	you	can	 regular 	 ly 	 	,	the	 result 	 s 	 	will	be	about	what	they	should	be	.
not	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	what	you	would	want	them	to	be	,	but	they	will	be	about	what	they	should	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	you	will	know	 whet 	 her 	 	you	can	do	that	.
and	that	's	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	from	them	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	time	went	by	,	and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	more	about	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	i	think	it	 work 	 ed 	 	a	little	better	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	the	 result 	 s 	 	.	but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	the	score	of	a	game	to	be	the	 by 	 product 	 	of	these	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	not	the	end	 it 	 self 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	was	--	one	great	 philosoph 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	--	no	,	no	,	cervantes	.	cervantes	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	journey	is	better	than	the	end	.	``
and	i	like	that	.	i	think	that	is	--	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	you	get	there	,	there	's	 al 	 most 	 	a	 let 	 down 	 	.
but	there	's	 get 	 ting 	 	there	that	's	the	 f 	 un 	 	.
i	 like 	 d 	 	our	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	 basket 	 ball 	 	coach	at	ucla	i	 like 	 d 	 	our	 practice 	 s 	 	to	be	the	journey	,	and	the	game	would	be	the	end	.	the	end	result	.
i	'd	like	to	go	up	and	 s 	 it 	 	in	the	 stand 	 s 	 	and	watch	the	 player 	 s 	 	play	,	and	see	 whet 	 her 	 	i	'd	 d 	 one 	 	a	 de 	 cent 	 	job	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	week	.
there	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 player 	 s 	 	to	get	that	self	-	satisfaction	,	in	 know 	 ing 	 	that	they	'd	made	the	effort	to	do	the	best	of	which	they	are	 cap 	 able 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	'm	 ask 	 ed 	 	who	was	the	best	player	i	had	,	or	the	best	 team 	 s 	 	.
i	can	never	answer	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	the	 individual 	 s 	 	are	 concern 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	one	time	about	that	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	suppose	that	you	in	some	way	could	make	the	perfect	player	.	what	would	you	want	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	'd	want	one	that	 k 	 new 	 	why	he	was	at	ucla	:	to	get	an	education	,	he	was	a	good	student	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 k 	 new 	 	why	he	was	there	in	the	first	place	.
but	i	'd	want	one	that	could	play	,	too	.
i	'd	want	one	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	defense	 usual 	 ly 	 	 win 	 s 	 	 champion 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	and	would	work	hard	on	defense	.
but	i	'd	want	one	that	would	play	offense	too	.
i	'd	want	him	to	be	 un 	 self 	 ish 	 	,	and	look	for	the	pass	first	and	not	shoot	all	the	time	.
and	i	'd	want	one	that	could	pass	and	would	pass	.
i	've	had	some	that	could	and	would	n't	,	and	i	've	had	some	that	would	and	could	n't	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	them	to	be	able	to	shoot	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	them	to	be	good	 in 	 side 	 	too	.
i	'd	want	them	to	be	able	to	 re 	 bound 	 	well	at	both	 end 	 s 	 	,	too	.
and	why	not	just	take	 some 	 one 	 	like	keith	wilkes	and	let	it	go	at	that	.
he	had	the	 qual 	 ification 	 s 	 	.	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	,	but	he	was	one	that	i	used	in	that	 part 	 icular 	 	 categor 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	he	made	the	effort	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	best	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.
i	 ment 	 ion 	 	in	my	book	,	``	they	call	me	coach	.	``
two	 player 	 s 	 	that	 g 	 ave 	 	me	great	satisfaction	;	that	came	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	i	think	 any 	 one 	 	i	ever	had	to	reach	 the 	 ir 	 	full	potential	:	one	was	conrad	burke	.	and	one	was	doug	mcintosh	.
when	i	saw	them	 a 	 s 	 	 fresh 	 men 	 	,	on	our	 fresh 	 men 	 	team	--	we	did	n't	have	--	 fresh 	 men 	 	could	n't	play	 var 	 s 	 ity 	 	when	i	taught	.
and	i	thought	,	``	oh	 gr 	 acious 	 	,	if	these	two	 player 	 s 	 	,	either	one	of	them	``	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	different	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	i	thought	about	each	one	at	the	time	he	was	there	--	``	oh	,	if	he	ever	 make 	 s 	 	the	 var 	 s 	 ity 	 	,	our	 var 	 s 	 ity 	 	must	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	,	if	he	's	good	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	it	.	``
and	you	know	one	of	them	was	a	 start 	 ing 	 	player	for	a	season	and	a	half	.
the	other	was	--	his	next	year	,	he	 play 	 ed 	 	32	 minute 	 s 	 	in	a	national	 champion 	 ship 	 	game	,	did	a	tremendous	job	for	us	.	and	the	next	year	,	he	was	a	 start 	 ing 	 	player	on	the	national	 champion 	 ship 	 	team	.
and	here	i	thought	he	'd	never	play	a	minute	,	when	he	was	--	so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	give	you	great	joy	,	and	great	satisfaction	to	see	one	.
 n 	 either 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 young 	 sters 	 	could	shoot	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
but	they	had	 out 	 stand 	 ing 	 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	 percent 	 age 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	did	n't	force	it	.
and	 n 	 either 	 	one	could	jump	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	but	they	got	--	 ke 	 pt 	 	good	position	,	and	so	they	did	well	 re 	 bound 	 ing 	 	.	they	 remember 	 ed 	 	that	every	shot	that	is	taken	,	they	 assum 	 ed 	 	would	be	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	.
i	've	had	too	 man 	 y 	 	that	stand	around	and	wait	to	see	if	it	's	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	,	then	they	go	and	it	's	too	late	.
 some 	 body 	 	else	is	in	there	 a 	 head 	 	of	them	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	,	but	they	 play 	 ed 	 	good	position	,	 ke 	 pt 	 	in	good	balance	.
and	so	they	 play 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	defense	for	us	.
so	they	had	 qual 	 ities 	 	that	--	they	came	close	to	--	 a 	 s 	 	close	to	 reach 	 ing 	 	possibly	 the 	 ir 	 	full	potential	 a 	 s 	 	any	 player 	 s 	 	i	ever	had	.
so	i	consider	them	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	lewis	alcindor	or	bill	walton	,	or	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 other 	 s 	 	that	we	had	,	there	was	some	 out 	 stand 	 ing 	 	--	some	 out 	 stand 	 ing 	 	 player 	 s 	 	.
have	i	 ram 	 bled 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	?
i	was	told	that	when	he	 make 	 s 	 	his	 appear 	 ance 	 	,	i	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	shut	up	.
