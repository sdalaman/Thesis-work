we	're	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	announce	the	first	synthetic	cell	,	a	cell	made	by	 start 	 ing 	 	with	the	digital	code	in	the	computer	,	building	the	 chromosom 	 e 	 	from	four	 bottle 	 s 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	 assem 	 bling 	 	that	 chromosom 	 e 	 	in	 y 	 east 	 	,	 transplant 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	recipient	bacterial	cell	and	 transform 	 ing 	 	that	cell	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	bacterial	species	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	self	-	 replica 	 ting 	 	species	that	we	've	had	on	the	planet	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	parent	is	a	computer	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	is	the	first	species	to	have	 it 	 s 	 	own	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 encode 	 d 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	genetic	code	.
but	we	'll	talk	more	about	the	 water 	 mark 	 s 	 	in	a	minute	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	that	had	 it 	 s 	 	 in 	 ception 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	our	team	then	--	we	 call 	 ed 	 	the	institute	tigr	--	was	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	the	first	two	 genome 	 s 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	did	haemophilus	 influenza 	 e 	 	and	then	the	 small 	 est 	 	genome	of	a	self	-	 replica 	 ting 	 	organism	,	that	of	 myco 	 plasma 	 	 genital 	 ium 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	we	had	these	two	 sequence 	 s 	 	we	thought	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	the	 small 	 est 	 	genome	of	a	self	-	 replica 	 ting 	 	species	,	could	there	be	even	a	 small 	 er 	 	genome	?
could	we	understand	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	cellular	life	at	the	genetic	level	?
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	15	-	year	quest	just	to	get	to	the	 start 	 ing 	 	point	now	to	be	able	to	answer	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	eliminate	 multi 	 ple 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	from	a	cell	.
you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	do	them	one	at	a	time	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	early	on	that	we	had	to	take	a	synthetic	route	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 no 	 body 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	there	before	,	to	see	if	we	could	synthesize	a	bacterial	 chromosom 	 e 	 	so	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	vary	the	gene	content	to	understand	the	essential	 gene 	 s 	 	for	life	.
that	 start 	 ed 	 	our	15	-	year	quest	to	get	here	.
but	before	we	did	the	first	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	art	caplan	's	team	at	the	university	of	pennsylvania	to	 under 	 take 	 	a	review	of	what	the	 risk 	 s 	 	,	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	the	 ethic 	 s 	 	around	creating	new	species	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	had	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	before	.
they	 s 	 pent 	 	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	 review 	 ing 	 	that	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	and	 publish 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 result 	 s 	 	in	science	in	1999	.
ham	and	i	took	two	 year 	 s 	 	off	 a 	 s 	 	a	side	project	to	sequence	the	human	genome	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	we	got	back	to	the	task	at	hand	.
in	2002	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	a	new	institute	,	the	institute	for	 bio 	 logical 	 	energy	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	,	where	we	set	out	two	 goal 	 s 	 	:	one	,	to	understand	the	impact	of	our	technology	on	the	environment	,	and	how	to	understand	the	environment	better	,	and	two	,	to	start	down	 th 	 is 	 	process	of	making	synthetic	life	to	understand	 bas 	 ic 	 	life	.
in	2003	,	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	our	first	success	.
so	ham	smith	and	clyde	hutchison	 develop 	 ed 	 	some	new	 method 	 s 	 	for	making	error	-	free	dna	at	a	small	level	.
our	first	task	was	a	5,000	-	letter	code	 bacter 	 io 	 phage 	 	,	a	virus	that	 attack 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	e.	coli	.
so	that	was	the	phage	phi	x	174	,	which	was	 chose 	 n 	 	for	 historic 	 al 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.
it	was	the	first	dna	phage	,	dna	virus	,	dna	genome	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 sequence 	 d 	 	.
so	once	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	could	make	5,000	-	base	pair	viral	-	sized	 piece 	 s 	 	,	we	thought	,	we	at	 l 	 east 	 	have	the	 mean 	 s 	 	then	to	try	and	make	 s 	 erial 	 ly 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	these	 piece 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	assemble	them	together	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	mega	base	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
so	,	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	 large 	 r 	 	than	we	even	thought	we	would	go	 initi 	 ally 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 step 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 side 	 s 	 	:	we	had	to	solve	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	for	making	large	dna	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	and	we	had	to	solve	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	side	of	how	,	if	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	new	chemical	 ent 	 ity 	 	,	how	would	we	boot	it	up	,	activate	it	in	a	recipient	cell	.
we	had	two	 team 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	parallel	:	one	team	on	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	and	the	other	on	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	able	to	transplant	entire	 chromosom 	 es 	 	to	get	new	 cell 	 s 	 	.
when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	out	,	we	thought	the	synthesis	would	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	problem	,	which	is	why	we	chose	the	 small 	 est 	 	genome	.
and	some	of	you	have	 notice 	 d 	 	that	we	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	from	the	 small 	 est 	 	genome	to	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	one	.
and	we	can	walk	through	the	 reason 	 s 	 	for	that	,	but	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	small	cell	took	on	the	order	of	one	to	two	 month 	 s 	 	to	get	 result 	 s 	 	from	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 large 	 r 	 	,	 fast 	 er 	 	-	growing	cell	 take 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	.
so	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 cycle 	 s 	 	we	could	go	through	in	a	year	at	six	 week 	 s 	 	per	cycle	.
and	you	should	know	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	99	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	99	percent	plus	of	our	 experiment 	 s 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 de 	 bug 	 ging 	 	,	problem	-	solving	scenario	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	no	recipe	of	how	to	get	there	.
so	,	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 public 	 ations 	 	we	had	was	in	2007	.
carole	lartigue	led	the	effort	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	transplant	a	bacterial	 chromosom 	 e 	 	from	one	bacteria	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
i	think	 philosoph 	 ically 	 	,	that	was	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	that	we	've	ever	 d 	 one 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 show 	 ed 	 	how	dynamic	life	was	.
and	we	 k 	 new 	 	,	once	that	 work 	 ed 	 	,	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	chance	if	we	could	make	the	synthetic	 chromosom 	 es 	 	to	do	the	same	with	 t 	 hose 	 	.
we	did	n't	know	that	it	was	going	to	take	us	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	more	to	get	there	.
in	2008	,	we	 report 	 ed 	 	the	complete	synthesis	of	the	 myco 	 plasma 	 	 genital 	 ium 	 	genome	,	a	little	over	500,000	 letter 	 s 	 	of	genetic	code	,	but	we	have	not	yet	 succeed 	 ed 	 	in	 boot 	 ing 	 	up	that	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
we	think	in	part	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 	growth	and	,	in	part	,	 cell 	 s 	 	have	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 ique 	 	defense	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	to	keep	these	 event 	 s 	 	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	the	cell	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	transplant	 in 	 to 	 	had	a	 nuc 	 lease 	 	,	an	enzyme	that	 chew 	 s 	 	up	dna	on	 it 	 s 	 	surface	,	and	was	happy	to	eat	the	synthetic	dna	that	we	 g 	 ave 	 	it	and	never	got	 transplant 	 ations 	 	.
but	at	the	time	,	that	was	the	largest	molecule	of	a	defined	structure	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	made	.
and	so	both	 side 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 progress 	 ing 	 	,	but	part	of	the	synthesis	had	to	be	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	or	was	able	to	be	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	using	 y 	 east 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 fragment 	 s 	 	in	 y 	 east 	 	and	 y 	 east 	 	would	assemble	these	for	us	.
it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	step	forward	,	but	we	had	a	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	now	we	had	the	bacterial	 chromosom 	 es 	 	growing	in	 y 	 east 	 	.
so	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 do 	 ing 	 	the	transplant	,	we	had	to	find	out	how	to	get	a	bacterial	 chromosom 	 e 	 	out	of	the	 eukary 	 otic 	 	 y 	 east 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	form	where	we	could	transplant	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	recipient	cell	.
so	our	team	 develop 	 ed 	 	new	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	for	 actual 	 ly 	 	growing	,	 clon 	 ing 	 	entire	bacterial	 chromosom 	 es 	 	in	 y 	 east 	 	.
so	we	took	the	same	 myco 	 ide 	 s 	 	genome	that	carole	had	 initi 	 ally 	 	 transplant 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	grew	that	in	 y 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	artificial	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
and	we	thought	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	great	test	bed	for	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	get	 chromosom 	 es 	 	out	of	 y 	 east 	 	and	transplant	them	.
when	we	did	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	we	could	get	the	 chromosom 	 e 	 	out	of	 y 	 east 	 	but	it	would	n't	transplant	and	boot	up	a	cell	.
that	little	issue	took	the	team	two	 year 	 s 	 	to	solve	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	the	dna	in	the	bacterial	cell	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 methyl 	 ated 	 	,	and	the	 methyl 	 ation 	 	 protect 	 s 	 	it	from	the	 restrict 	 ion 	 	enzyme	,	from	 digest 	 ing 	 	the	dna	.
so	what	we	found	is	if	we	took	the	 chromosom 	 e 	 	out	of	 y 	 east 	 	and	 methyl 	 ated 	 	it	,	we	could	then	transplant	it	.
further	 advance 	 s 	 	came	when	the	team	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	the	 restrict 	 ion 	 	enzyme	 gene 	 s 	 	from	the	recipient	 capric 	 o 	 lum 	 	cell	.
and	once	we	had	 d 	 one 	 	that	,	now	we	can	take	naked	dna	out	of	 y 	 east 	 	and	transplant	it	.
so	last	fall	when	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	that	work	in	science	,	we	all	 be 	 came 	 	 over 	 confident 	 	and	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	away	from	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	now	boot	up	a	 chromosom 	 e 	 	out	of	 y 	 east 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 myco 	 plasma 	 	 genital 	 ium 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 	growth	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	synthesize	the	much	 large 	 r 	 	 chromosom 	 e 	 	,	the	 myco 	 ide 	 s 	 	 chromosom 	 e 	 	,	 know 	 ing 	 	that	we	had	the	biology	 work 	 ed 	 	out	on	that	for	 transplant 	 ation 	 	.
and	dan	led	the	team	for	the	synthesis	of	 th 	 is 	 	over	one	-	million	-	base	pair	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
but	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	it	was	n't	going	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	simple	in	the	end	,	and	it	set	us	back	three	 month 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	one	error	out	of	over	a	million	base	 pair 	 s 	 	in	that	sequence	.
so	the	team	 develop 	 ed 	 	new	 de 	 bug 	 ging 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	where	we	could	test	each	synthetic	fragment	to	see	if	it	would	grow	in	a	 back 	 ground 	 	of	wild	type	dna	.
and	we	found	that	10	out	of	the	11	100,000	-	base	pair	 piece 	 s 	 	we	 synthesize 	 d 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	accurate	and	compatible	with	a	life	-	 form 	 ing 	 	sequence	.
we	 narrow 	 ed 	 	it	down	to	one	fragment	;	we	 sequence 	 d 	 	it	and	found	just	one	base	pair	had	 be 	 en 	 	 delet 	 ed 	 	in	an	essential	gene	.
so	 accu 	 racy 	 	is	essential	.
there	's	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	genome	where	it	can	not	 toler 	 ate 	 	even	a	single	error	,	and	then	there	's	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	genome	where	we	can	put	in	large	 block 	 s 	 	of	dna	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	did	with	the	 water 	 mark 	 s 	 	,	and	it	can	 toler 	 ate 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 error 	 s 	 	.
so	it	took	about	three	 month 	 s 	 	to	find	that	error	and	repair	it	.
and	then	early	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	at	6	a.m	.
we	got	a	text	from	dan	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	now	,	the	first	blue	 colon 	 ies 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	long	route	to	get	here	:	15	 year 	 s 	 	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
we	felt	one	of	the	 ten 	 et 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	field	was	to	make	 absolute 	 ly 	 	certain	we	could	distinguish	synthetic	dna	from	natural	dna	.
early	on	,	when	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	a	new	area	of	science	,	you	have	to	think	about	all	the	 pit 	 fall 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	that	could	lead	you	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	you	had	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	when	you	had	n't	,	and	,	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	 other 	 s 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	it	.
so	,	we	thought	the	worst	problem	would	be	a	single	molecule	 contami 	 nation 	 	of	the	native	 chromosom 	 e 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	us	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 create 	 d 	 	a	synthetic	cell	,	when	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	just	a	 contami 	 nant 	 	.
so	early	on	,	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 put 	 ting 	 	in	 water 	 mark 	 s 	 	in	the	dna	to	 absolute 	 ly 	 	make	clear	that	the	dna	was	synthetic	.
and	the	first	 chromosom 	 e 	 	we	built	in	2008	--	the	500,000	-	base	pair	one	--	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	 assign 	 ed 	 	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 author 	 s 	 	of	the	 chromosom 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	genetic	code	,	but	it	was	using	just	 am 	 ino 	 	acid	single	letter	 transl 	 ations 	 	,	which	 leav 	 es 	 	out	certain	 letter 	 s 	 	of	the	 alpha 	 bet 	 	.
so	the	team	 actual 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	new	code	 with 	 in 	 	the	code	 with 	 in 	 	the	code	.
so	it	's	a	new	code	for	 interpret 	 ing 	 	and	writing	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	in	dna	.
now	,	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 hid 	 ing 	 	and	writing	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	in	the	genetic	code	for	a	long	time	,	but	it	's	clear	they	 we 	 re 	 	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	and	not	 biologist 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	write	long	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	with	the	code	that	the	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	it	would	more	than	 like 	 ly 	 	lead	to	new	 protein 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 synthesize 	 d 	 	with	 un 	 known 	 	 function 	 s 	 	.
so	the	code	that	 mi 	 ke 	 	montague	and	the	team	 develop 	 ed 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 put 	 s 	 	frequent	stop	 co 	 don 	 s 	 	,	so	it	's	a	different	 alpha 	 bet 	 	but	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	use	the	entire	english	 alpha 	 bet 	 	with	 punctu 	 ation 	 	and	 number 	 s 	 	.
so	,	there	are	four	major	 water 	 mark 	 s 	 	all	over	1,000	base	 pair 	 s 	 	of	genetic	code	.
the	first	one	 actual 	 ly 	 	 contain 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	it	 th 	 is 	 	code	for	 interpret 	 ing 	 	the	rest	of	the	genetic	code	.
so	in	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	information	,	in	the	 water 	 mark 	 s 	 	,	contain	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	,	i	think	it	's	46	different	 author 	 s 	 	and	key	 contributor 	 s 	 	to	 get 	 ting 	 	the	project	to	 th 	 is 	 	stage	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	built	in	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	address	so	that	if	 some 	 body 	 	 decode 	 s 	 	the	code	 with 	 in 	 	the	code	 with 	 in 	 	the	code	,	they	can	 s 	 end 	 	an	email	to	that	address	.
so	it	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	 distinguish 	 able 	 	from	any	other	species	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	46	 name 	 s 	 	in	it	,	 it 	 s 	 	own	web	address	.
and	we	 add 	 ed 	 	three	 quota 	 tions 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	with	the	first	genome	we	 we 	 re 	 	 critic 	 ized 	 	for	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 pro 	 found 	 	than	just	 sign 	 ing 	 	the	work	.
so	we	wo	n't	give	the	rest	of	the	code	,	but	we	will	give	the	three	 quota 	 tions 	 	.
the	first	is	,	``	to	live	,	to	 er 	 r 	 	,	to	fall	,	to	triumph	and	to	 re 	 create 	 	life	out	of	life	.	``
it	's	a	james	joyce	quote	.
the	second	 quota 	 tion 	 	is	,	``	see	 thing 	 s 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	they	might	be	.	``
it	's	a	quote	from	the	``	american	prometheus	``	book	on	robert	oppenheimer	.
and	the	last	one	is	a	richard	feynman	quote	:	``	what	i	can	not	build	,	i	can	not	understand	.	``
so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	much	a	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	advance	 a 	 s 	 	a	technical	advance	in	science	,	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	deal	with	both	the	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	and	the	technical	side	.
the	last	thing	i	want	to	say	before	 turn 	 ing 	 	it	over	to	 question 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 extens 	 ive 	 	work	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	--	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 ethic 	 al 	 	review	,	 push 	 ing 	 	the	 envelop 	 e 	 	on	that	side	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	technical	side	--	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 broad 	 ly 	 	 discuss 	 ed 	 	in	the	scientific	community	,	in	the	policy	community	and	at	the	highest	 level 	 s 	 	of	the	federal	government	.
even	with	 th 	 is 	 	 announce 	 ment 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	did	in	2003	--	that	work	was	funded	by	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	energy	,	so	the	work	was	 review 	 ed 	 	at	the	level	of	the	white	house	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	to	 class 	 ify 	 	the	work	or	publish	it	.
and	they	came	down	on	the	side	of	open	 public 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	the	right	approach	--	we	've	 brief 	 ed 	 	the	white	house	,	we	've	 brief 	 ed 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	congress	,	we	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	take	and	push	the	policy	 issue 	 s 	 	in	parallel	with	the	scientific	 advance 	 s 	 	.
so	with	that	,	i	would	like	to	open	it	first	to	the	floor	for	 question 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	in	the	back	.
 report 	 er 	 	:	could	you	explain	,	in	 lay 	 man 	 	's	 term 	 s 	 	,	how	significant	a	 break 	 through 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pleas 	 e 	 	?
craig	venter	:	can	we	explain	how	significant	 th 	 is 	 	is	?
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	we	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	should	be	 explain 	 ing 	 	how	significant	it	is	.
it	's	significant	to	us	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	's	a	giant	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	change	in	how	we	view	life	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	view	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	baby	step	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	,	it	's	taken	us	15	 year 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	do	the	experiment	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	on	 understand 	 ing 	 	life	at	 it 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	level	.
but	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	set	of	 tool 	 s 	 	and	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	in	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	 a 	 venue 	 s 	 	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	tool	.
we	have	,	at	the	institute	,	 on 	 going 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	now	from	nih	in	a	program	with	novartis	to	try	and	use	these	new	synthetic	dna	 tool 	 s 	 	to	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	make	the	flu	 vaccin 	 e 	 	that	you	might	get	next	year	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	taking	 week 	 s 	 	to	 month 	 s 	 	to	make	these	,	dan	's	team	can	now	make	these	in	less	than	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.
so	when	you	see	how	long	it	took	to	get	an	h	1n1	 vaccin 	 e 	 	out	,	we	think	we	can	 short 	 en 	 	that	process	 quit 	 e 	 	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	.
in	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	area	,	synthetic	 genomic 	 s 	 	and	the	institute	are	 form 	 ing 	 	a	new	 vaccin 	 e 	 	company	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	these	 tool 	 s 	 	can	affect	 vaccin 	 es 	 	to	 disease 	 s 	 	that	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	possible	to	date	,	 thing 	 s 	 	where	the	viruses	 rapid 	 ly 	 	evolve	,	 s 	 uch 	 	with	 rhino 	 virus 	 	.
would	n't	it	be	nice	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 block 	 ed 	 	common	 cold 	 s 	 	?
or	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	hiv	,	where	the	virus	 evolve 	 s 	 	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	the	 vaccin 	 es 	 	that	are	made	 to 	 day 	 	ca	n't	keep	up	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	at	synthetic	 genomic 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	major	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 lat 	 est 	 	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	is	a	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	.
we	ca	n't	see	co	2	--	we	depend	on	scientific	 measure 	 ments 	 	for	it	and	we	see	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	 result 	 s 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	too	much	of	it	--	but	we	can	see	pre	-	co	2	now	 float 	 ing 	 	on	the	 water 	 s 	 	and	 contami 	 nating 	 	the	 beach 	 es 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	.
we	need	some	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	for	oil	.
we	have	a	program	with	exxon	mobile	to	try	and	develop	new	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	that	can	 efficient 	 ly 	 	capture	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	from	the	atmosphere	or	from	 concent 	 rated 	 	 source 	 s 	 	,	make	new	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	that	can	go	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 refine 	 ries 	 	to	make	normal	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	and	 dies 	 el 	 	fuel	out	of	co	2	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	just	a	couple	of	the	 approach 	 es 	 	and	 direction 	 s 	 	that	we	're	taking	.
