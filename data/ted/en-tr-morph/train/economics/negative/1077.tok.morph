i	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	you	about	what	i	call	the	``	mesh	.	``
it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	fundamental	shift	in	our	relationship	with	stuff	,	with	the	 thing 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	--	not	 al 	 ways 	 	and	not	for	 every 	 thing 	 	--	but	in	certain	 moment 	 s 	 	of	time	,	access	to	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 good 	 s 	 	and	service	will	trump	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	them	.
and	so	it	's	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	better	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 eas 	 ily 	 	 share 	 d 	 	.
and	we	come	from	a	long	tradition	of	sharing	.
we	've	 share 	 d 	 	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
we	've	 share 	 d 	 	wine	and	food	and	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	fabulous	 experience 	 s 	 	in	coffee	 bar 	 s 	 	in	amsterdam	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 share 	 d 	 	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 entertain 	 ment 	 	--	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	 arena 	 s 	 	,	public	 park 	 s 	 	,	concert	 hall 	 s 	 	,	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	,	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	.
all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	share	-	 platform 	 s 	 	,	but	sharing	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 start 	 s 	 	and	 end 	 s 	 	with	what	i	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	mother	of	all	share	-	 platform 	 s 	 	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	think	about	the	mesh	and	i	think	about	,	well	,	what	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	it	,	how	come	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	,	i	think	there	's	a	number	of	 vector 	 s 	 	that	i	want	to	give	you	 a 	 s 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	.
one	is	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	--	that	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	us	to	 re 	 think 	 	our	relationship	with	the	 thing 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	the	value	--	so	 start 	 ing 	 	to	align	the	value	with	the	true	cost	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	population	growth	and	density	 in 	 to 	 	cities	.
more	people	,	 small 	 er 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	less	stuff	.
climate	change	:	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	stress	in	our	personal	 live 	 s 	 	and	in	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	on	the	planet	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	 dis 	 trust 	 	of	big	 brand 	 s 	 	,	global	big	 brand 	 s 	 	,	in	a	bunch	of	different	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	,	and	that	's	 create 	 d 	 	an	 open 	 ing 	 	.
research	is	 show 	 ing 	 	here	,	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	in	canada	and	western	europe	,	that	most	of	us	are	much	more	open	to	local	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	or	 brand 	 s 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	we	have	n't	heard	of	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	before	,	we	went	with	the	big	 brand 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	we	 trust 	 ed 	 	.
and	last	is	that	we	're	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	now	to	more	people	on	the	planet	than	ever	before	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	if	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	 some 	 one 	 	.
the	other	thing	that	's	worth	 consider 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	've	made	a	huge	 invest 	 ment 	 	over	 decade 	 s 	 	and	 decade 	 s 	 	,	and	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	have	gone	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	that	now	is	our	 inherit 	 ance 	 	.
it	's	a	physical	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	get	from	point	a	to	point	b	and	move	 thing 	 s 	 	that	way	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	--	web	and	mobile	allow	us	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	and	create	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 platform 	 s 	 	and	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	that	 infra 	 structure 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	our	 inherit 	 ance 	 	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	engage	in	 re 	 ally 	 	new	and	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	.
and	so	for	me	,	a	mesh	company	,	the	``	classic	``	mesh	company	,	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	together	these	three	 thing 	 s 	 	:	our	ability	to	connect	to	each	other	--	most	of	us	are	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	with	these	mobile	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	are	gps	-	enabled	and	web	-	enabled	--	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	find	each	other	and	find	 thing 	 s 	 	in	time	and	space	.
and	third	is	that	physical	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 read 	 able 	 	on	a	map	--	so	 restaurant 	 s 	 	,	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 venue 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	with	gps	and	other	technology	like	rfid	and	it	 continu 	 es 	 	to	expand	beyond	that	,	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	track	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	moving	,	like	a	car	,	a	 taxi 	 cab 	 	,	a	transit	system	,	a	box	that	's	moving	through	time	and	space	.
and	so	that	 set 	 s 	 	up	for	making	access	to	get	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	more	convenient	and	less	 cost 	 ly 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	than	 own 	 ing 	 	them	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	want	to	use	zipcar	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	have	 experience 	 d 	 	car	-	sharing	or	bike	-	sharing	?
 w 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	great	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	thank	you	.
is	the	largest	car	-	sharing	company	in	the	world	.
they	did	not	invent	car	-	sharing	.
car	-	sharing	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	europe	.
one	of	the	 founder 	 s 	 	went	to	switzerland	,	saw	it	 implement 	 ed 	 	 some 	 place 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	that	 look 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
i	think	we	can	do	that	in	cambridge	,	``	 br 	 ought 	 	it	to	cambridge	and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	--	two	women	--	 rob 	 in 	 	chase	 be 	 ing 	 	the	other	person	who	 start 	 ed 	 	it	.
zipcar	got	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	right	.
first	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	a	brand	is	a	voice	and	a	product	is	a	souvenir	.
and	so	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	about	the	way	that	they	 package 	 d 	 	car	-	sharing	.
they	made	it	sexy	.	they	made	it	fresh	.
they	made	it	 aspir 	 ation 	 al 	 	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	member	of	the	club	,	when	you	're	a	member	of	a	club	,	you	're	a	zipster	.
the	 car 	 s 	 	they	 pick 	 ed 	 	did	n't	look	like	ex	-	cop	 car 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 hollow 	 ed 	 	out	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
they	 pick 	 ed 	 	these	sexy	 car 	 s 	 	.
they	 target 	 ed 	 	to	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	.
they	made	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	 demo 	 graphic 	 	for	who	they	 we 	 re 	 	 target 	 ing 	 	and	the	car	was	all	 match 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	experience	,	and	the	 car 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	clean	and	 reli 	 able 	 	,	and	it	all	 work 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	from	a	 brand 	 ing 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	they	got	a	lot	right	.
but	they	 under 	 stood 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	that	they	are	not	a	car	company	.
they	understand	that	they	are	an	information	company	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	buy	a	car	we	go	to	the	 deal 	 er 	 	once	,	we	have	an	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	and	we	're	 ch 	 ow 	 	--	 usual 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
but	when	you	're	sharing	a	car	and	you	have	a	car	-	share	service	,	you	might	use	an	e.v	.	to	commute	,	you	get	a	truck	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	home	project	.
when	you	pick	your	aunt	up	at	the	 air 	 port 	 	,	you	get	a	 s 	 ed 	 an 	 	.
and	you	're	going	to	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	to	ski	,	you	get	different	 access 	 ories 	 	put	on	the	car	for	 do 	 ing 	 	that	sort	of	thing	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	back	,	 collect 	 ing 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	data	about	our	behavior	and	how	we	interact	with	the	service	.
and	so	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	an	option	for	them	,	but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	an	 imper 	 ative 	 	for	zipcar	and	other	mesh	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 w 	 ow 	 	us	,	to	be	like	a	 con 	 cierge 	 	service	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	give	them	so	much	information	,	and	they	are	 en 	 titled 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	see	how	it	is	that	we	're	moving	.
they	're	in	 re 	 ally 	 	good	shape	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	what	we	're	going	to	want	next	.
and	so	what	percent	of	the	day	do	you	think	the	average	person	uses	a	car	?
what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	time	?
any	 guess 	 es 	 	?
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
i	was	 imagin 	 ing 	 	it	was	like	20	percent	when	i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	.
the	number	 a 	 cross 	 	the	u.s.	and	western	europe	is	eight	percent	.
and	so	 bas 	 ically 	 	even	if	you	think	it	's	10	percent	,	90	percent	of	the	time	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 cost 	 s 	 	us	a	lot	of	money	--	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	we	organize	our	cities	around	it	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	90	percent	of	the	time	it	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	around	.
so	for	 th 	 is 	 	reason	,	i	think	one	of	the	other	 theme 	 s 	 	with	the	mesh	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	that	,	if	we	 squeez 	 e 	 	hard	on	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 throw 	 n 	 	away	,	there	's	a	lot	of	value	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
what	set	up	with	zipcar	--	zipcar	 start 	 ed 	 	in	2000	.
in	the	last	year	,	2010	,	two	car	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	one	that	's	in	the	u.k.	 call 	 ed 	 	whipcar	,	and	the	other	one	,	relayrides	,	in	the	u.s	.
they	're	both	peer	-	to	-	peer	car	-	sharing	 service 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	work	for	car	-	sharing	is	,	one	,	the	car	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	two	,	it	's	 with 	 in 	 	one	or	two	 block 	 s 	 	of	where	you	stand	.
well	the	car	that	's	one	or	two	 block 	 s 	 	from	your	home	or	your	 off 	 ice 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	your	neighbor	's	car	,	and	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
so	people	have	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	business	.
zipcar	 start 	 ed 	 	a	decade	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	in	2000	.
it	took	them	six	 year 	 s 	 	to	get	1,000	 car 	 s 	 	in	service	.
whipcar	,	which	 start 	 ed 	 	april	of	last	year	,	it	took	them	six	 month 	 s 	 	to	get	1,000	 car 	 s 	 	in	the	service	.
so	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
people	are	making	 any 	 where 	 	between	200	and	700	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	 lett 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	use	 the 	 ir 	 	car	when	they	're	not	using	it	.
so	it	's	like	 vac 	 ation 	 	 rent 	 al 	 s 	 	for	 car 	 s 	 	.
since	i	'm	here	--	and	i	hope	some	people	in	the	audience	are	in	the	car	business	--	--	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	that	,	coming	from	the	technology	side	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	we	saw	cable	-	ready	tvs	and	wifi	-	ready	 note 	 book 	 s 	 	--	it	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	great	if	,	any	minute	now	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	could	start	 roll 	 ing 	 	share	-	ready	 car 	 s 	 	off	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	just	 create 	 s 	 	more	 flex 	 ibility 	 	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	 a 	 s 	 	 owner 	 s 	 	to	have	other	 option 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	we	're	going	there	 any 	 way 	 	.
the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	with	mesh	 business 	 es 	 	--	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 business 	 es 	 	like	zipcar	or	netflix	that	are	full	mesh	 business 	 es 	 	,	or	other	 one 	 s 	 	where	you	have	a	lot	of	the	car	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	car	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	,	who	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	car	-	share	 service 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	a	second	 flan 	 ker 	 	brand	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	a	test	,	i	think	--	is	to	make	sharing	 ir 	 resist 	 ible 	 	.
we	have	 experience 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	sharing	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ir 	 resist 	 ible 	 	.
it	's	just	,	how	do	we	make	that	 re 	 current 	 	and	scale	it	?
we	know	 al 	 so 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	in	social	 network 	 s 	 	,	that	it	's	easy	to	create	 de 	 light 	 	in	one	little	place	.
it	's	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	all	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	each	other	.
so	if	i	have	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	experience	and	i	tweet	it	,	or	i	tell	five	people	 stand 	 ing 	 	next	to	me	,	news	 travel 	 s 	 	.
the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	,	is	 al 	 so 	 	true	,	often	more	true	.
so	here	we	have	ludotruck	,	which	is	in	l.a.	,	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	gourmet	food	 truck 	 s 	 	do	,	and	they	've	 gather 	 ed 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 follow 	 ing 	 	.
in	general	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	a	tech	entrepreneur	,	i	look	at	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 platform 	 s 	 	.
 platform 	 s 	 	are	 invit 	 ations 	 	.
so	creating	craigslist	or	itunes	and	the	iphone	 develop 	 er 	 	network	,	there	are	all	these	 network 	 s 	 	--	facebook	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
these	 platform 	 s 	 	 invit 	 e 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ers 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	people	to	come	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	create	and	target	an	application	for	a	 part 	 icular 	 	audience	.
and	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	full	of	 surprise 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	think	any	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	could	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 application 	 s 	 	that	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	facebook	,	around	facebook	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	mark	 announce 	 d 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	go	with	a	platform	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	i	think	that	cities	are	 platform 	 s 	 	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	detroit	is	a	platform	.
the	 invit 	 ation 	 	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	makers	and	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	 stimul 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 fi 	 ery 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 help 	 s 	 	a	city	to	 thriv 	 e 	 	.
it	's	 invit 	 ing 	 	 particip 	 ation 	 	,	and	cities	have	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	 invit 	 ed 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 particip 	 ation 	 	.
now	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	that	there	's	other	 option 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	city	 depart 	 ments 	 	can	open	up	transit	data	.
google	 ha 	 s 	 	made	 avail 	 able 	 	transit	data	api	.
and	so	there	's	about	seven	or	eight	cities	 al 	 ready 	 	in	the	u.s	.
that	have	 provide 	 d 	 	the	transit	data	,	and	different	 develop 	 ers 	 	are	building	 application 	 s 	 	.
so	i	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	coffee	in	portland	,	and	half	-	of	-	a	-	latte	in	and	the	little	board	in	the	cafe	all	of	a	sudden	 start 	 s 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	me	that	the	next	bus	is	coming	in	three	 minute 	 s 	 	and	the	train	is	coming	in	16	 minute 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	's	 reli 	 able 	 	,	real	data	that	's	right	in	my	face	,	where	i	am	,	so	i	can	finish	the	latte	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	fabulous	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	we	have	 a 	 cross 	 	the	u.s.	now	:	about	21	percent	of	 vac 	 ant 	 	commercial	and	industrial	space	.
that	space	is	not	vital	.
the	 area 	 s 	 	around	it	lack	 vital 	 ity 	 	and	 vib 	 r 	 ancy 	 	and	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	thing	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	have	heard	of	pop	-	up	 store 	 s 	 	or	pop	-	up	 shop 	 s 	 	?
oh	,	great	.	so	i	'm	a	big	fan	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	mesh	-	y	thing	.
 essential 	 ly 	 	,	there	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 restaurant 	 s 	 	in	oakland	,	near	where	i	live	.
there	's	a	pop	-	up	general	store	every	three	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	they	do	a	fantastic	job	of	making	a	 ver 	 y 	 	social	event	 happen 	 ing 	 	for	 food 	 ies 	 	.
super	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 transit 	 ional 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
 sub 	 sequent 	 	to	that	,	after	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	for	about	a	year	now	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	lease	and	create	and	extend	.
an	area	that	was	edgy	-	artsy	is	now	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	much	 cool 	 er 	 	and	engage	a	lot	more	people	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
the	 craft 	 y 	 	fox	is	 th 	 is 	 	woman	who	's	 in 	 to 	 	 craft 	 s 	 	,	and	she	 do 	 es 	 	these	pop	-	up	 craft 	 s 	 	 fair 	 s 	 	around	london	.
but	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	different	 environment 	 s 	 	.
from	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	pop	-	up	 store 	 s 	 	do	is	create	 perish 	 ability 	 	and	 urge 	 ncy 	 	.
it	 create 	 s 	 	two	of	the	 favor 	 ite 	 	 word 	 s 	 	of	any	 business 	 person 	 	:	 s 	 old 	 	out	.
and	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	focus	trust	and	attention	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
so	a	lot	of	what	we	see	in	the	mesh	,	and	a	lot	of	what	we	have	in	the	platform	that	we	built	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	define	,	refine	and	scale	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	test	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	entrepreneur	,	to	go	to	market	,	to	be	in	conversation	with	people	,	listen	,	refine	 some 	 thing 	 	and	go	back	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cost	-	effective	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	mesh	-	y	.
the	 infra 	 structure 	 	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	that	.
in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	end	,	i	just	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	--	and	i	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	share	my	 failure 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 th 	 ough 	 	not	from	the	stage	.
i	would	just	like	to	say	that	one	of	the	big	 thing 	 s 	 	,	when	we	look	at	waste	and	when	we	look	at	ways	that	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	and	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	each	other	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	move	to	create	a	better	economic	 situ 	 ation 	 	and	a	better	 environment 	 al 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	is	by	sharing	 failure 	 s 	 	.
and	one	quick	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	velib	,	in	2007	,	came	forward	in	paris	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bold	 pro 	 position 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	bike	-	sharing	service	.
they	made	a	lot	of	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
they	had	some	number	of	big	 success 	 es 	 	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	or	they	had	to	be	,	in	the	way	that	they	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	what	 work 	 ed 	 	and	did	n't	work	.
and	so	b.c	.	in	barcelona	and	b	-	cycle	and	boris	 bike 	 s 	 	in	london	--	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	had	to	repeat	the	version	1.0	screw	-	 up 	 s 	 	and	expensive	 learn 	 ing 	 	 exercis 	 es 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	paris	.
so	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	when	we	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	to	share	 failure 	 s 	 	and	 success 	 es 	 	.
we	're	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	and	the	way	that	mesh	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	coming	forward	,	is	 invit 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 engag 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	early	.
i	have	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	--	it	's	a	 director 	 y 	 	--	and	it	 start 	 ed 	 	with	about	1,200	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	and	in	the	last	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	 month 	 s 	 	it	's	up	to	about	3,300	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
and	it	 grow 	 s 	 	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	regular	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
so	i	just	want	to	welcome	all	of	you	onto	the	ride	.
and	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
