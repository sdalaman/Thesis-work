i	am	a	 vi 	 car 	 	in	the	church	of	england	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	priest	in	the	church	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
for	most	of	that	time	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	and	 grappl 	 ing 	 	with	 question 	 s 	 	about	the	nature	of	god	.	who	is	god	?
and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	aware	that	when	you	say	the	word	``	god	,	``	 man 	 y 	 	people	will	turn	off	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
and	most	people	,	both	 with 	 in 	 	and	 out 	 side 	 	the	 organize 	 d 	 	church	,	still	have	a	picture	of	a	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	 controll 	 er 	 	,	a	rule	maker	,	a	 police 	 man 	 	in	the	sky	who	 order 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	 cause 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	to	happen	.
he	will	protect	his	own	people	,	and	answer	the	 pray 	 ers 	 	of	the	 faith 	 ful 	 	.
and	in	the	worship	of	my	church	,	the	most	 frequent 	 ly 	 	used	adjective	about	god	is	``	 al 	 might 	 y 	 	.	``
but	i	have	a	problem	with	that	.
i	have	 be 	 come 	 	more	and	more	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	of	god	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	god	is	the	kind	of	male	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 present 	 ing 	 	in	our	worship	and	in	our	 lit 	 u 	 rgie 	 s 	 	over	all	these	 year 	 s 	 	?
of	course	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ers 	 	who	have	 suggest 	 ed 	 	different	ways	of	looking	at	god	.
 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	 femin 	 ine 	 	,	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	side	of	 div 	 in 	 ity 	 	.
 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	god	 express 	 es 	 	 him 	 self 	 	or	 her 	 self 	 	through	 power 	 lessness 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	power	.
 acknowledg 	 ing 	 	that	god	is	 un 	 known 	 	and	 un 	 know 	 able 	 	by	definition	.
 find 	 ing 	 	deep	 reson 	 ance 	 s 	 	with	other	 relig 	 ions 	 	and	 philosoph 	 ies 	 	and	ways	of	looking	at	life	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	what	is	a	universal	and	global	search	for	meaning	.
these	 idea 	 s 	 	are	well	known	in	liberal	academic	 circle 	 s 	 	,	but	clergy	like	 my 	 self 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	air	them	,	for	fear	of	creating	tension	and	division	in	our	church	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	for	fear	of	 up 	 setting 	 	the	simple	faith	of	more	 tradition 	 al 	 	 believ 	 ers 	 	.
i	have	 chose 	 n 	 	not	to	rock	the	boat	.
then	,	on	december	26th	last	year	,	just	two	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	 under 	 water 	 	 earth 	 quake 	 	 trigger 	 ed 	 	the	tsunami	.
and	two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	sunday	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	9th	of	january	,	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	my	 congreg 	 ation 	 	--	intelligent	,	well	meaning	,	 most 	 ly 	 	 thought 	 ful 	 	christian	people	--	and	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	express	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 be 	 half 	 	,	our	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	our	 question 	 s 	 	.
i	had	my	own	personal	 respons 	 es 	 	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	public	role	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	 s 	 aid 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	 s 	 aid 	 	.
 short 	 ly 	 	after	the	tsunami	i	read	a	 news 	 paper 	 	article	written	by	the	archbishop	of	canterbury	--	fine	title	--	about	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	in	southern	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	people	most	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	the	 deva 	 station 	 	and	loss	of	life	do	not	want	intellectual	 the 	 ories 	 	about	how	god	let	 th 	 is 	 	happen	.
he	wrote	,	``	if	some	religious	 gen 	 ius 	 	did	come	up	with	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	why	all	these	 death 	 s 	 	made	sense	,	would	we	feel	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	or	 safe 	 r 	 	,	or	more	confident	in	god	?	``
if	the	man	in	the	photograph	that	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	hand	of	his	dead	child	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	us	now	,	there	are	no	 word 	 s 	 	that	we	could	say	to	him	.
a	verbal	 respons 	 e 	 	would	not	be	appropriate	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	appropriate	 respons 	 e 	 	would	be	a	 com 	 passionate 	 	silence	and	some	kind	of	practical	help	.
it	is	n't	a	time	for	 explan 	 ation 	 	,	or	 preach 	 ing 	 	,	or	 the 	 ology 	 	;	it	's	a	time	for	 tear 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	true	.	and	yet	here	we	are	,	my	church	in	oxford	,	semi	-	 detach 	 ed 	 	from	 event 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	a	long	way	away	,	but	with	our	faith	 bruis 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	want	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	from	god	.
we	demand	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	from	god	.
some	have	 conclude 	 d 	 	that	we	can	 on 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	god	who	 share 	 s 	 	our	pain	.
in	some	way	,	god	must	feel	the	 angu 	 ish 	 	,	and	grief	,	and	physical	pain	that	we	feel	.
in	some	way	the	 e 	 ternal 	 	god	must	be	able	to	enter	 in 	 to 	 	the	 soul 	 s 	 	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	experience	the	 tor 	 ment 	 	 with 	 in 	 	.
and	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	,	it	must	 al 	 so 	 	be	that	god	 know 	 s 	 	the	joy	and	 ex 	 alt 	 ation 	 	of	the	human	spirit	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
we	want	a	god	who	can	weep	with	 t 	 hose 	 	who	weep	,	and	 re 	 jo 	 ice 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 re 	 jo 	 ice 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	both	a	 deep 	 ly 	 	moving	and	a	convincing	re	-	 state 	 ment 	 	of	christian	belief	about	god	.
for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	 prevail 	 ing 	 	 orthodox 	 y 	 	,	the	 accept 	 ed 	 	truth	,	was	that	god	the	father	,	the	creator	,	is	 un 	 changing 	 	and	 there 	 fore 	 	by	definition	can	not	feel	pain	or	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	.
now	the	 un 	 changing 	 	god	 feel 	 s 	 	a	bit	cold	and	 in 	 different 	 	to	me	.
and	the	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	 event 	 s 	 	of	the	20th	century	have	 force 	 d 	 	people	to	question	the	cold	,	 un 	 feel 	 ing 	 	god	.
the	 s 	 laughter 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	in	the	 trench 	 es 	 	and	in	the	death	 camp 	 s 	 	have	 caus 	 ed 	 	people	to	ask	,	``	where	is	god	in	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
who	is	god	in	all	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	the	answer	was	,	``	god	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	with	us	,	or	god	 do 	 es 	 	n't	deserve	our	allegiance	 any 	 more 	 	.	``
if	god	is	a	 by 	 stand 	 er 	 	,	 observ 	 ing 	 	but	not	 involve 	 d 	 	,	then	god	may	well	exist	,	but	we	do	n't	want	to	know	about	him	.
 man 	 y 	 	jews	and	christians	now	feel	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	know	.
and	i	am	among	them	.
so	we	have	a	 suffer 	 ing 	 	god	--	a	god	who	is	 intima 	 te 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	world	and	with	every	living	soul	.
i	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 re 	 late 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	god	.
but	it	is	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	.	i	need	to	ask	some	more	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	i	hope	they	are	 question 	 s 	 	that	you	will	want	to	ask	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	some	of	you	.
over	the	last	few	 week 	 s 	 	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	by	the	number	of	 time 	 s 	 	that	 word 	 s 	 	in	our	worship	have	felt	a	bit	 in 	 appropriate 	 	,	a	bit	dodgy	.
we	have	a	 p 	 ram 	 	service	on	tuesday	 morn 	 ing 	 s 	 	for	 mum 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	pre	-	school	children	.
and	last	week	we	 s 	 ang 	 	with	the	children	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 favor 	 ite 	 	 song 	 s 	 	,	``	the	wise	man	built	his	house	 up 	 on 	 	the	rock	.	``
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	of	you	know	it	.	some	of	the	 word 	 s 	 	go	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	the	 fool 	 ish 	 	man	built	his	house	 up 	 on 	 	the	sand	/	and	the	 flood 	 s 	 	came	up	/	and	the	house	on	the	sand	went	crash	.	``
then	in	the	same	week	,	at	a	funeral	,	we	 s 	 ang 	 	the	familiar	hymn	``	we	plow	the	 field 	 s 	 	and	scatter	,	``	a	 ver 	 y 	 	english	hymn	.
in	the	second	verse	 come 	 s 	 	the	line	,	``	the	wind	and	 wave 	 s 	 	obey	him	.	``
do	they	?	i	do	n't	feel	we	can	 s 	 ing 	 	that	song	 aga 	 in 	 	in	church	,	after	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
so	the	first	big	question	is	about	control	.
 do 	 es 	 	god	have	a	plan	for	each	of	us	?	is	god	in	control	?
 do 	 es 	 	god	order	each	moment	?	 do 	 es 	 	the	wind	and	the	 wave 	 s 	 	obey	him	?
from	time	to	time	,	one	 hear 	 s 	 	christians	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	story	of	how	god	 organize 	 d 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	them	,	so	that	 every 	 thing 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	out	all	right	--	some	 difficult 	 y 	 	 over 	 come 	 	,	some	 ill 	 ness 	 	 cur 	 ed 	 	,	some	trouble	 a 	 vert 	 ed 	 	,	a	 park 	 ing 	 	space	found	at	a	 cruci 	 al 	 	time	.
i	can	remember	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	me	,	with	her	 eye 	 s 	 	 shin 	 ing 	 	with	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 confirm 	 ation 	 	of	her	faith	and	the	 good 	 ness 	 	of	god	.
but	if	god	can	or	will	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 inter 	 vene 	 	to	change	the	flow	of	 event 	 s 	 	--	then	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	he	could	have	 stop 	 ped 	 	the	tsunami	.
do	we	have	a	local	god	who	can	do	little	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 park 	 ing 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	but	not	big	 thing 	 s 	 	like	500	mile	-	per	-	hour	 wave 	 s 	 	?
that	's	just	not	 accept 	 able 	 	to	intelligent	christians	,	and	we	must	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	it	.
either	god	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	the	tsunami	,	or	god	is	not	in	control	.
after	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	,	 surviv 	 al 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	emerge	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	some	of	them	:	the	man	who	 surf 	 ed 	 	the	wave	,	the	 teen 	 age 	 	girl	who	 recogn 	 ized 	 	the	danger	 be 	 cause 	 	she	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	 tsunami 	 s 	 	at	school	.
then	there	was	the	 congreg 	 ation 	 	who	had	left	 the 	 ir 	 	usual	church	building	on	the	shore	to	hold	a	service	in	the	 hill 	 s 	 	.
the	 preach 	 er 	 	 deliver 	 ed 	 	an	extra	long	sermon	,	so	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	still	out	of	harm	's	way	when	the	wave	 s 	 truck 	 	.
 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	god	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	looking	after	them	.
so	the	next	question	is	about	 partial 	 ity 	 	.
can	we	earn	god	's	favor	by	 worship 	 ping 	 	him	or	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	him	?
 do 	 es 	 	god	demand	 loyal 	 ty 	 	,	like	any	 med 	 ieval 	 	 ty 	 rant 	 	?
a	god	who	 look 	 s 	 	after	his	own	,	so	that	christians	are	ok	,	while	 every 	 one 	 	else	 perish 	 es 	 	?
a	 cosm 	 ic 	 	us	and	them	,	and	a	god	who	is	 guilt 	 y 	 	of	the	worst	kind	of	 favor 	 it 	 ism 	 	?
that	would	be	 app 	 all 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	would	be	the	point	at	which	i	would	hand	in	my	 member 	 ship 	 	.
 s 	 uch 	 	a	god	would	be	 moral 	 ly 	 	 infer 	 ior 	 	to	the	highest	 ideal 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
so	who	is	god	,	if	not	the	great	puppet	-	master	or	the	 trib 	 al 	 	 protect 	 or 	 	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	god	 allow 	 s 	 	or	 permit 	 s 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	happen	,	so	that	 hero 	 ism 	 	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	can	be	 show 	 n 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	god	is	 test 	 ing 	 	us	:	 test 	 ing 	 	our	 char 	 ity 	 	,	or	our	faith	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	is	a	great	,	 cosm 	 ic 	 	plan	that	 allow 	 s 	 	for	 horr 	 ible 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	so	that	 every 	 thing 	 	will	work	out	ok	in	the	end	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	but	these	 idea 	 s 	 	are	all	just	 vari 	 ations 	 	on	god	 controll 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	 command 	 er 	 	 to 	 y 	 ing 	 	with	 expend 	 able 	 	 unit 	 s 	 	in	a	great	campaign	.
we	are	still	left	with	a	god	who	can	do	the	tsunami	and	allow	auschwitz	.
in	his	great	novel	,	``	the	 brother 	 s 	 	karamazov	,	``	dostoevsky	 give 	 s 	 	these	 word 	 s 	 	to	ivan	,	 address 	 ed 	 	to	his	naive	and	 dev 	 out 	 	 young 	 er 	 	brother	,	alyosha	:	``	if	the	 suffer 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	children	go	to	make	up	the	sum	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 s 	 	which	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	the	purchase	of	truth	,	then	i	say	 before 	 hand 	 	that	the	entire	truth	is	not	worth	 s 	 uch 	 	a	price	.
we	can	not	afford	to	pay	so	much	for	 ad 	 mission 	 	.
it	is	not	god	that	i	do	not	accept	.
i	 mere 	 ly 	 	,	most	 respect 	 fully 	 	,	return	him	the	ticket	.	``
or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	god	set	the	whole	 uni 	 verse 	 	going	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	and	then	 relinquish 	 ed 	 	control	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	so	that	natural	 process 	 es 	 	could	occur	,	and	evolution	run	 it 	 s 	 	course	.
 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	more	 accept 	 able 	 	,	but	it	still	 leav 	 es 	 	god	with	the	ultimate	moral	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
is	god	a	cold	,	 un 	 feel 	 ing 	 	 spect 	 ator 	 	?
or	a	 power 	 less 	 	lover	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	with	infinite	 compass 	 ion 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	god	is	 un 	 able 	 	to	control	or	change	?
is	god	 intima 	 te 	 ly 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	our	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	so	that	he	 feel 	 s 	 	it	in	his	own	 be 	 ing 	 	?
if	we	 believ 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	must	let	go	of	the	puppet	-	master	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	take	our	 leav 	 e 	 	of	the	 al 	 might 	 y 	 	 controll 	 er 	 	,	abandon	 tradition 	 al 	 	 model 	 s 	 	.
we	must	think	 aga 	 in 	 	about	god	.
 may 	 be 	 	god	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	 thing 	 s 	 	at	all	.
 may 	 be 	 	god	is	n't	an	agent	like	all	of	us	are	 agent 	 s 	 	.
early	religious	thought	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	god	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	 super 	 human 	 	person	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	all	over	the	place	.
 beat 	 ing 	 	up	the	egyptians	,	 drown 	 ing 	 	them	in	the	red	sea	,	 was 	 ting 	 	cities	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	.
the	people	 k 	 new 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	god	by	his	 might 	 y 	 	 act 	 s 	 	.
but	what	if	god	 do 	 es 	 	n't	act	?	what	if	god	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	 thing 	 s 	 	at	all	?
what	if	god	is	in	 thing 	 s 	 	?
the	loving	soul	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
an	in	-	dwelling	 com 	 passionate 	 	presence	,	 under 	 pinning 	 	and	 sustain 	 ing 	 	all	 thing 	 s 	 	.
what	if	god	is	in	 thing 	 s 	 	?
in	the	 infinite 	 ly 	 	complex	network	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	and	 connect 	 ions 	 	that	make	up	life	.
in	the	natural	cycle	of	life	and	death	,	the	creation	and	 destruct 	 ion 	 	that	must	happen	 continu 	 ously 	 	.
in	the	process	of	evolution	.
in	the	 in 	 credible 	 	 intric 	 acy 	 	and	 magnific 	 ence 	 	of	the	natural	world	.
in	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	 un 	 conscious 	 	,	the	soul	of	the	human	race	.
in	you	,	in	me	,	mind	and	body	and	spirit	.
in	the	tsunami	,	in	the	 victim 	 s 	 	.	in	the	depth	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
in	presence	and	in	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	.	in	 simpl 	 icity 	 	and	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
in	change	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	growth	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	-	ness	,	 th 	 is 	 	 inner 	 ness 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 terior 	 ity 	 	of	god	work	?
it	's	hard	to	 conceiv 	 e 	 	,	and	 beg 	 s 	 	more	 question 	 s 	 	.
is	god	just	 an 	 other 	 	name	for	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	with	no	 in 	 dependent 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	at	all	?
i	do	n't	know	.
to	what	 ex 	 tent 	 	can	we	 a 	 scribe 	 	 personal 	 ity 	 	to	god	?
i	do	n't	know	.
in	the	end	,	we	have	to	say	,	``	i	do	n't	know	.	``
if	we	 k 	 new 	 	,	god	would	not	be	god	.
to	have	faith	in	 th 	 is 	 	god	would	be	more	like	 trust 	 ing 	 	an	essential	 benevol 	 ence 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	less	like	 believ 	 ing 	 	a	system	of	 doctri 	 nal 	 	 state 	 ments 	 	.
is	n't	it	 iron 	 ic 	 	that	christians	who	claim	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	an	infinite	,	 un 	 know 	 able 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	then	tie	god	down	in	closed	 system 	 s 	 	and	rigid	 doctri 	 nes 	 	?
how	could	one	practice	 s 	 uch 	 	a	faith	?
by	seeking	the	god	 with 	 in 	 	.	by	 cultiv 	 ating 	 	my	own	 in 	 ward 	 ness 	 	.
in	silence	,	in	 medit 	 ation 	 	,	in	my	inner	space	,	in	the	me	that	 remain 	 s 	 	when	i	 gent 	 ly 	 	put	 a 	 side 	 	my	 pass 	 ing 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 pre 	 occupation 	 s 	 	.
in	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	the	inner	conversation	.
and	how	would	we	live	 s 	 uch 	 	a	faith	?	how	would	i	live	 s 	 uch 	 	a	faith	?
by	seeking	 intima 	 te 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	your	 in 	 ward 	 ness 	 	.
the	kind	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	when	deep	 speak 	 s 	 	to	deep	.
if	god	is	in	all	people	,	then	there	is	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	place	where	my	relationship	with	you	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	three	-	way	 en 	 counter 	 	.
there	is	an	indian	 greet 	 ing 	 	,	which	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	some	of	you	know	:	``	namaste	,	``	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	a	 respect 	 ful 	 	bow	,	which	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	 transl 	 ated 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	``	that	which	is	of	god	in	me	 greet 	 s 	 	that	which	of	god	is	in	you	.	``
namaste	.
and	how	would	one	deepen	 s 	 uch 	 	a	faith	?
by	seeking	the	 in 	 ward 	 ness 	 	which	is	in	all	 thing 	 s 	 	.
in	music	and	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	in	the	natural	world	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	in	the	small	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	of	life	,	there	is	a	deep	,	 in 	 dwelling 	 	presence	that	 make 	 s 	 	them	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	 attentive 	 ness 	 	and	a	patient	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	a	 contempl 	 ative 	 	attitude	and	a	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	and	 open 	 ness 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	experience	is	different	from	my	own	.
when	i	stood	up	to	speak	to	my	people	about	god	and	the	tsunami	,	i	had	no	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 	them	.
no	neat	 package 	 s 	 	of	faith	,	with	 b 	 ible 	 	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	to	prove	them	.
 on 	 ly 	 	 doubt 	 s 	 	and	 question 	 ing 	 	and	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
i	had	some	 suggest 	 ions 	 	to	make	--	possible	new	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	god	.
ways	that	might	allow	us	to	go	on	,	down	a	new	and	 un 	 chart 	 ed 	 	road	.
but	in	the	end	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	i	could	say	for	 s 	 ure 	 	was	,	``	i	do	n't	know	,	``	and	that	just	might	be	the	most	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	religious	 state 	 ment 	 	of	all	.
thank	you	.
