david	gallo	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	bill	lange	.	i	'm	dave	gallo	.
and	we	're	going	to	tell	you	some	 st 	 ories 	 	from	the	sea	here	in	video	.
we	've	got	some	of	the	most	 in 	 credible 	 	video	of	 titan 	 ic 	 	that	's	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	we	're	not	going	to	show	you	any	of	it	.
the	truth	of	the	matter	is	that	the	 titan 	 ic 	 	--	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 break 	 ing 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	box	 off 	 ice 	 	 record 	 s 	 	--	it	's	not	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	story	from	the	sea	.
and	the	problem	,	i	think	,	is	that	we	take	the	ocean	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
when	you	think	about	it	,	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	are	75	percent	of	the	planet	.
most	of	the	planet	is	ocean	water	.
the	average	depth	is	about	two	 mile 	 s 	 	.
part	of	the	problem	,	i	think	,	is	we	stand	at	the	beach	,	or	we	see	 image 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	of	the	ocean	,	and	you	look	out	at	 th 	 is 	 	great	big	blue	expanse	,	and	it	's	 shimmer 	 ing 	 	and	it	's	moving	and	there	's	 wave 	 s 	 	and	there	's	surf	and	there	's	 tide 	 s 	 	,	but	you	have	no	idea	for	what	lies	in	there	.
and	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	there	are	the	 long 	 est 	 	mountain	 range 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	.
most	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	are	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
most	of	the	 earth 	 quake 	 s 	 	and	 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	are	in	the	sea	,	at	the	bottom	of	the	sea	.
the	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	the	 bio 	 density 	 	in	the	ocean	is	 high 	 er 	 	,	in	 place 	 s 	 	,	than	it	is	in	the	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 un 	 explore 	 d 	 	,	and	yet	there	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 sight 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	that	 captiv 	 ate 	 	us	and	make	us	 be 	 come 	 	familiar	with	it	.
but	when	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	at	the	beach	,	i	want	you	to	think	that	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	at	the	edge	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 familiar 	 	world	.
we	have	to	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	technology	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	that	 un 	 familiar 	 	world	.
we	use	the	 sub 	 marine 	 	alvin	and	we	use	 camera 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 camera 	 s 	 	are	 some 	 thing 	 	that	bill	lange	 ha 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	with	the	help	of	sony	.
marcel	proust	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	true	voyage	of	 discover 	 y 	 	is	not	so	much	in	seeking	new	 land 	 scapes 	 	 a 	 s 	 	in	 hav 	 ing 	 	new	 eye 	 s 	 	.	``
people	that	have	 partner 	 ed 	 	with	us	have	 give 	 n 	 	us	new	 eye 	 s 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	on	what	 exist 	 s 	 	--	the	new	 land 	 scapes 	 	at	the	bottom	of	the	sea	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	how	we	think	about	life	on	the	planet	 it 	 self 	 	.
here	's	a	jelly	.
it	's	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	got	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	the	 long 	 est 	 	creature	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	up	to	about	150	feet	long	.
but	see	all	 t 	 hose 	 	different	 work 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	?
i	love	that	kind	of	stuff	.
it	's	got	these	 fish 	 ing 	 	 lure 	 s 	 	on	the	bottom	.	they	're	going	up	and	down	.
it	's	got	 tent 	 acle 	 s 	 	 dan 	 gling 	 	,	 swirl 	 ing 	 	around	like	that	.
it	's	a	colonial	animal	.
these	are	all	individual	 animal 	 s 	 	 band 	 ing 	 	together	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	one	creature	.
and	it	's	got	these	jet	 thrust 	 ers 	 	up	in	front	that	it	'll	use	in	a	moment	,	and	a	little	light	.
if	you	take	all	the	big	fish	and	 school 	 ing 	 	fish	and	all	that	,	put	them	on	one	side	of	the	scale	,	put	all	the	jelly	-	type	of	 animal 	 s 	 	on	the	other	side	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	win	 hand 	 s 	 	down	.
most	of	the	 bio 	 mass 	 	in	the	ocean	is	made	out	of	 creature 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
here	's	the	x	-	wing	death	jelly	.
the	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	--	they	use	the	 light 	 s 	 	for	 attract 	 ing 	 	 mate 	 s 	 	and	 attract 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	and	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	.
we	could	n't	begin	to	show	you	our	 archiv 	 al 	 	stuff	from	the	 j 	 elli 	 es 	 	.
they	come	in	all	different	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	and	 shape 	 s 	 	.
bill	lange	:	we	tend	to	forget	about	the	fact	that	the	ocean	is	 mile 	 s 	 	deep	on	average	,	and	that	we	're	real	familiar	with	the	 animal 	 s 	 	that	are	in	the	first	200	or	300	feet	,	but	we	're	not	familiar	with	what	 exist 	 s 	 	from	there	all	the	way	down	to	the	bottom	.
and	these	are	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	that	live	in	that	three	-	dimensional	space	,	that	micro	-	 gravit 	 y 	 	environment	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	n't	 explore 	 d 	 	.
you	hear	about	giant	 s 	 quid 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	but	some	of	these	 animal 	 s 	 	get	up	to	be	 approximate 	 ly 	 	140	,	160	feet	long	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	little	 under 	 stood 	 	.
dg	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	them	,	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	our	 favor 	 ites 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	little	octopod	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	through	his	head	.
and	here	he	is	,	flapping	with	his	 ear 	 s 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 grace 	 fully 	 	going	up	.
we	see	 t 	 hose 	 	at	all	 depth 	 s 	 	and	even	at	the	 great 	 est 	 	 depth 	 s 	 	.
they	go	from	a	couple	of	 inch 	 es 	 	to	a	couple	of	feet	.
they	come	right	up	to	the	 sub 	 marine 	 	--	they	'll	put	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	right	up	to	the	window	and	peek	 in 	 side 	 	the	sub	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	world	 with 	 in 	 	a	world	,	and	we	're	going	to	show	you	two	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	're	 pass 	 ing 	 	down	through	the	mid	-	ocean	and	we	see	 creature 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	like	an	 under 	 sea 	 	 roo 	 ster 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	that	 look 	 s 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 form 	 al 	 	,	in	a	way	.
and	then	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	.	what	a	face	!
 th 	 is 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	scientific	data	that	you	're	looking	at	.
it	's	 foot 	 age 	 	that	we	've	 collect 	 ed 	 	for	scientific	 purpose 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	bill	's	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	is	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	first	view	of	 animal 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	the	world	where	they	belong	.
they	do	n't	catch	them	in	a	net	.
they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	at	them	down	in	that	world	.
we	're	going	to	take	a	 joy 	 stick 	 	,	 s 	 it 	 	in	front	of	our	computer	,	on	the	earth	,	and	press	the	 joy 	 stick 	 	forward	,	and	fly	around	the	planet	.
we	're	going	to	look	at	the	mid	-	ocean	ridge	,	a	40,000	-	mile	long	mountain	range	.
the	average	depth	at	the	top	of	it	is	about	a	mile	and	a	half	.
and	we	're	over	the	atlantic	--	that	's	the	ridge	right	there	--	but	we	're	going	to	go	 a 	 cross 	 	the	caribbean	,	central	america	,	and	end	up	against	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	nine	 degree 	 s 	 	north	.
we	make	 map 	 s 	 	of	these	mountain	 range 	 s 	 	with	sound	,	with	 son 	 ar 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	mountain	 range 	 s 	 	.
we	're	coming	around	a	cliff	here	on	the	right	.
the	height	of	these	 mountain 	 s 	 	on	either	side	of	 th 	 is 	 	 val 	 ley 	 	is	 great 	 er 	 	than	the	alps	in	most	 case 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 mountain 	 s 	 	out	there	that	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 ma 	 pped 	 	yet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 volcan 	 ic 	 	ridge	.
we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	down	further	and	further	in	scale	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	we	can	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	icon	of	our	robot	,	jason	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	.
and	you	can	 s 	 it 	 	in	a	room	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	with	a	 joy 	 stick 	 	and	a	 head 	 set 	 	,	and	drive	a	robot	like	that	around	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	in	real	time	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	at	 wood 	 s 	 	hole	with	our	 partner 	 s 	 	is	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	virtual	world	--	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 explore 	 d 	 	region	--	back	to	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	see	it	in	bits	and	 piece 	 s 	 	right	now	.
we	see	it	either	 a 	 s 	 	sound	,	or	we	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	video	,	or	we	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	or	we	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	chemical	 sensor 	 s 	 	,	but	we	never	have	yet	put	it	all	together	 in 	 to 	 	one	 interest 	 ing 	 	picture	.
here	's	where	bill	's	 camera 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	shine	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 hydro 	 thermal 	 	vent	.
and	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	a	cloud	of	 dense 	 ly 	 	 pack 	 ed 	 	,	hydrogen	-	sulfide	-	rich	water	coming	out	of	a	 volcan 	 ic 	 	axis	on	the	sea	floor	.
 get 	 s 	 	up	to	600	,	700	 degree 	 s 	 	f	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	that	range	.
so	that	's	all	water	under	the	sea	--	a	mile	and	a	half	,	two	 mile 	 s 	 	,	three	 mile 	 s 	 	down	.
and	we	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	 volcan 	 ic 	 	back	in	the	'60s	,	'70s	.
and	then	we	had	some	hint	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	the	axis	of	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	've	got	 volcan 	 ism 	 	,	water	's	going	to	get	down	from	the	sea	 in 	 to 	 	 crack 	 s 	 	in	the	sea	floor	,	come	in	contact	with	magma	,	and	come	 shoot 	 ing 	 	out	hot	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	aware	that	it	would	be	so	rich	with	 sulfide 	 s 	 	,	hydrogen	 sulfide 	 s 	 	.
we	did	n't	have	any	idea	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	we	call	 chimney 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	these	 hydro 	 thermal 	 	 vent 	 s 	 	.
six	hundred	degree	f	water	coming	out	of	the	earth	.
on	either	side	of	us	are	mountain	 range 	 s 	 	that	are	 high 	 er 	 	than	the	alps	,	so	the	setting	here	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
bl	:	the	white	material	is	a	type	of	bacteria	that	 thriv 	 es 	 	at	180	 degree 	 s 	 	c	.
dg	:	i	think	that	's	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	right	now	that	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	from	the	bottom	of	the	sea	,	is	that	the	first	thing	we	see	coming	out	of	the	sea	floor	after	a	 volcan 	 ic 	 	 erupt 	 ion 	 	is	bacteria	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	wonder	for	a	long	time	,	how	did	it	all	get	down	there	?
what	we	find	out	now	is	that	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	coming	from	 in 	 side 	 	the	earth	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	it	coming	out	of	the	earth	--	so	,	 bio 	 genesis 	 	made	from	 volcan 	 ic 	 	activity	--	but	that	bacteria	 support 	 s 	 	these	 colon 	 ies 	 	of	life	.
the	pressure	here	is	4,000	 pound 	 s 	 	per	square	inch	.
a	mile	and	a	half	from	the	surface	to	two	 mile 	 s 	 	to	three	 mile 	 s 	 	--	no	 s 	 un 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	gotten	down	here	.
all	the	energy	to	support	these	life	 form 	 s 	 	is	coming	from	 in 	 side 	 	the	earth	--	so	,	 chemo 	 synthesis 	 	.
and	you	can	see	how	dense	the	population	is	.
these	are	 call 	 ed 	 	tube	 worm 	 s 	 	.
bl	:	these	 worm 	 s 	 	have	no	 digest 	 ive 	 	system	.	they	have	no	mouth	.
but	they	have	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	gill	 structure 	 s 	 	.
one	for	 ex 	 tract 	 ing 	 	oxygen	out	of	the	deep	-	sea	water	,	 an 	 other 	 	one	which	 house 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 chemo 	 synthetic 	 	bacteria	,	which	 take 	 s 	 	the	 hydro 	 thermal 	 	fluid	--	that	hot	water	that	you	saw	coming	out	of	the	bottom	--	and	 convert 	 s 	 	that	 in 	 to 	 	simple	 sugar 	 s 	 	that	the	tube	worm	can	digest	.
dg	:	you	can	see	,	here	's	a	crab	that	 live 	 s 	 	down	there	.
he	's	 manage 	 d 	 	to	grab	a	tip	of	these	 worm 	 s 	 	.
now	,	they	 normal 	 ly 	 	 re 	 tract 	 	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	a	crab	 touch 	 es 	 	them	.
oh	!	good	going	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	a	crab	 touch 	 es 	 	them	,	they	 re 	 tract 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 shell 	 s 	 	,	just	like	your	 finger 	 nail 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	whole	story	 be 	 ing 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	out	here	that	we	're	just	now	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	have	some	idea	of	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	new	camera	technology	.
bl	:	these	 worm 	 s 	 	live	in	a	real	temperature	 extrem 	 e 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	foot	is	at	about	200	 degree 	 s 	 	c	and	 the 	 ir 	 	head	is	out	at	three	 degree 	 s 	 	c	,	so	it	's	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	your	hand	in	 boil 	 ing 	 	water	and	your	foot	in	freezing	water	.
that	's	how	they	like	to	live	.
dg	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	female	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	worm	.
and	here	's	a	male	.
you	watch	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	long	before	two	 guy 	 s 	 	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	one	and	one	that	will	show	up	over	here	--	start	to	fight	.
 every 	 thing 	 	you	see	is	 play 	 ed 	 	out	in	the	pitch	black	of	the	deep	sea	.
there	are	never	any	 light 	 s 	 	there	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	 light 	 s 	 	that	we	 br 	 ing 	 	.
here	they	go	.
on	one	of	the	last	 d 	 ive 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	,	we	 count 	 ed 	 	200	species	in	these	 area 	 s 	 	--	198	 we 	 re 	 	new	,	new	species	.
bl	:	one	of	the	big	 problem 	 s 	 	is	that	for	the	 biologist 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	at	these	 s 	 ites 	 	,	it	's	 ra 	 ther 	 	difficult	to	collect	these	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 dis 	 integrate 	 	on	the	way	up	,	so	the	 image 	 ry 	 	is	critical	for	the	science	.
dg	:	two	 octopod 	 s 	 	at	about	two	 mile 	 s 	 	depth	.
 th 	 is 	 	pressure	thing	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaze 	 s 	 	me	--	that	these	 animal 	 s 	 	can	exist	there	at	a	depth	with	pressure	 en 	 ough 	 	to	crush	the	 titan 	 ic 	 	like	an	empty	pepsi	can	.
what	we	saw	up	till	now	was	from	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	the	atlantic	.	even	 great 	 er 	 	depth	.
you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	shrimp	is	 harass 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	poor	little	guy	here	,	and	he	'll	bat	it	away	with	his	claw	.	whack	!
and	the	same	thing	's	going	on	over	here	.
what	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	at	is	that	--	on	the	back	of	 th 	 is 	 	crab	--	the	 food 	 stuff 	 	here	is	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	bacteria	that	 live 	 s 	 	on	the	 back 	 s 	 	of	all	these	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	what	these	shrimp	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	harvest	the	bacteria	from	the	 back 	 s 	 	of	these	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 crab 	 s 	 	do	n't	like	it	at	all	.
these	long	 fi 	 lament 	 s 	 	that	you	see	on	the	back	of	the	crab	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	product	of	that	bacteria	.
so	,	the	bacteria	 grow 	 s 	 	hair	on	the	crab	.
on	the	back	,	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	red	dot	is	the	laser	light	of	the	 sub 	 marine 	 	alvin	to	give	us	an	idea	about	how	far	away	we	are	from	the	 vent 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	shrimp	.
you	see	the	hot	water	over	here	,	here	and	here	,	coming	out	.
they	're	 cl 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	a	rock	face	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 scrap 	 ing 	 	bacteria	off	that	rock	face	.
here	's	a	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	vent	that	's	come	out	of	the	side	of	that	pillar	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 pillar 	 s 	 	get	up	to	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
so	here	,	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 val 	 ley 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	alien	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	 pillar 	 s 	 	and	hot	 spring 	 s 	 	and	 volcan 	 ic 	 	 erupt 	 ions 	 	and	 earth 	 quake 	 s 	 	,	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	by	these	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	 animal 	 s 	 	that	live	 on 	 ly 	 	on	chemical	energy	coming	out	of	the	ground	.
they	do	n't	need	the	 s 	 un 	 	at	all	.
bl	:	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	white	v	-	shaped	mark	on	the	back	of	the	shrimp	?
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	light	-	 sens 	 ing 	 	organ	.
it	's	how	they	find	the	 hydro 	 thermal 	 	 vent 	 s 	 	.
the	 vent 	 s 	 	are	 emit 	 ting 	 	a	black	body	 radi 	 ation 	 	--	an	ir	signature	--	and	so	they	're	able	to	find	these	 vent 	 s 	 	at	 consider 	 able 	 	 distance 	 s 	 	.
dg	:	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	that	40,000	-	mile	long	mountain	range	that	we	're	 call 	 ing 	 	the	ribbon	of	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	just	even	 to 	 day 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	,	there	's	life	 be 	 ing 	 	generated	there	from	 volcan 	 ic 	 	activity	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	time	we	've	ever	 tri 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	any	place	.
we	're	going	to	try	to	show	you	high	definition	from	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
we	're	moving	up	one	of	these	 pillar 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	tall	.
in	it	,	you	'll	see	that	it	's	a	 habit 	 at 	 	for	a	lot	of	different	 animal 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	funny	kind	of	hot	plate	here	,	with	vent	water	coming	out	of	it	.
so	all	of	these	are	individual	 home 	 s 	 	for	 worm 	 s 	 	.
now	here	's	a	 close 	 r 	 	view	of	that	community	.
here	's	 crab 	 s 	 	here	,	 worm 	 s 	 	here	.
there	are	 small 	 er 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	 crawl 	 ing 	 	around	.
here	's	pagoda	 structure 	 s 	 	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	neatest	-	looking	thing	.
i	just	ca	n't	get	over	 th 	 is 	 	--	that	you	've	got	these	little	 chimney 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	 smok 	 ing 	 	away	.
 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	toxic	 a 	 s 	 	hell	,	by	the	way	.
you	could	never	get	a	permit	to	dump	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	ocean	,	and	it	's	coming	out	all	from	it	.
it	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 sulfur 	 ic 	 	acid	,	and	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	just	 dump 	 ed 	 	out	,	at	 in 	 credible 	 	rates	.
and	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 thriv 	 ing 	 	--	and	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	came	from	here	.
that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	where	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	from	.
bl	:	 th 	 is 	 	bacteria	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	the	most	 simpl 	 est 	 	form	of	life	found	.
there	are	a	number	of	 group 	 s 	 	that	are	 pro 	 posing 	 	that	life	 evolv 	 ed 	 	at	these	vent	 s 	 ites 	 	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	vent	 s 	 ites 	 	are	short	-	lived	--	an	individual	 s 	 ite 	 	may	last	 on 	 ly 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	--	 a 	 s 	 	an	 eco 	 system 	 	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 table 	 	for	 million 	 s 	 	--	well	,	 billion 	 s 	 	--	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
dg	:	it	 work 	 s 	 	too	well	.	you	see	there	're	some	fish	 in 	 side 	 	here	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
there	's	a	fish	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	.
here	's	a	crab	with	his	claw	right	at	the	end	of	that	tube	worm	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	that	worm	to	stick	his	head	out	.
bl	:	the	 biologist 	 s 	 	right	now	can	not	explain	why	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	so	active	.
the	 worm 	 s 	 	are	growing	 inch 	 es 	 	per	week	!
dg	:	i	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	from	a	human	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	is	toxic	 a 	 s 	 	hell	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	on	top	--	the	 life 	 blood 	 	--	that	 plumb 	 ing 	 	system	 turn 	 s 	 	off	every	year	or	so	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 plumb 	 ing 	 	system	 turn 	 s 	 	off	,	so	the	 s 	 ites 	 	have	to	move	.
and	then	there	's	 earth 	 quake 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 volcan 	 ic 	 	 erupt 	 ions 	 	,	on	the	order	of	one	every	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	 complete 	 ly 	 	 wipe 	 s 	 	the	area	out	.
 de 	 spite 	 	that	,	these	 animal 	 s 	 	grow	back	in	about	a	year	's	time	.
you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 bio 	 den 	 s 	 ities 	 	and	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 high 	 er 	 	than	the	 rain 	 forest 	 	that	just	 spring 	 s 	 	back	to	life	.
is	it	sensitive	?	 y 	 es 	 	.
is	it	fragile	?	no	,	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fragile	.
i	'll	end	up	with	 say 	 ing 	 	one	thing	.
there	's	a	story	in	the	sea	,	in	the	 water 	 s 	 	of	the	sea	,	in	the	 sediment 	 s 	 	and	the	 rock 	 s 	 	of	the	sea	floor	.
it	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	story	.
what	we	see	when	we	look	back	in	time	,	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 sediment 	 s 	 	and	 rock 	 s 	 	,	is	a	record	of	earth	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	--	 every 	 thing 	 	--	 work 	 s 	 	by	 cycle 	 s 	 	and	 rhythm 	 s 	 	.
the	 continent 	 s 	 	move	 a 	 part 	 	.	they	come	back	together	.
 ocean 	 s 	 	come	and	go	.	 mountain 	 s 	 	come	and	go	.	 glaci 	 ers 	 	come	and	go	.
el	nino	 come 	 s 	 	and	 go 	 es 	 	.	it	's	not	a	disaster	,	it	's	 rhythm 	 ic 	 	.
what	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	now	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	 sym 	 phony 	 	.
it	's	just	like	music	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	just	like	music	.
and	what	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	now	is	that	you	ca	n't	listen	to	a	five	-	billion	-	year	long	 sym 	 phony 	 	,	get	to	 to 	 day 	 	and	say	,	``	stop	!	we	want	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	's	note	to	be	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	 to 	 day 	 	.	``
it	's	absurd	.	it	's	just	absurd	.
so	,	what	we	've	got	to	learn	now	is	to	find	out	where	 th 	 is 	 	planet	's	going	at	all	these	different	 scale 	 s 	 	and	work	with	it	.
learn	to	manage	it	.
the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 p 	 reservation 	 	is	 fu 	 tile 	 	.
 conserv 	 ation 	 	's	 tough 	 er 	 	,	but	we	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	get	there	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
thank	you	.
