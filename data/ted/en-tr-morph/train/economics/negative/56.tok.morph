walk	around	for	four	 month 	 s 	 	with	three	 wish 	 es 	 	,	and	all	the	 idea 	 s 	 	will	start	to	 per 	 col 	 ate 	 	up	.
i	think	 every 	 body 	 	should	do	it	--	think	that	you	've	got	three	 wish 	 es 	 	.
and	what	would	you	do	?	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	great	 exercis 	 e 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	drill	down	to	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	feel	are	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	reflect	on	the	world	around	us	.
and	 think 	 ing 	 	that	,	can	an	individual	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	or	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	,	that	may	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	some	 tract 	 ion 	 	out	there	and	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	?
inspired	by	nature	--	that	's	the	theme	here	.
and	i	think	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	where	i	 start 	 ed 	 	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	canadian	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	great	north	.	and	there	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	small	population	,	and	my	father	was	an	avid	 out 	 door 	 s 	 man 	 	.
so	i	 re 	 ally 	 	had	a	chance	to	experience	that	.
and	i	could	never	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	it	was	,	or	how	it	was	 inform 	 ing 	 	me	.
but	what	i	think	it	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	is	that	we	are	 th 	 is 	 	 trans 	 ient 	 	thing	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	the	nature	that	you	see	out	there	--	the	 un 	 touch 	 ed 	 	 shore 	 lines 	 	,	the	 un 	 touch 	 ed 	 	forest	that	i	was	able	to	see	--	 re 	 ally 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	in	a	sense	of	that	 geo 	 logical 	 	time	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	on	for	a	long	time	,	and	we	're	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	it	in	a	different	way	.
and	that	,	to	me	,	was	a	 re 	 ference 	 	point	that	i	think	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	have	to	be	able	to	make	the	work	that	i	did	.
and	i	did	go	out	,	and	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	picture	of	 grass 	 es 	 	coming	through	in	the	spring	,	 a 	 long 	 	a	 road 	 side 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 birth 	 	of	grass	.	and	then	i	went	out	for	 year 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	photograph	the	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	a	fine	-	art	 photograph 	 er 	 	i	 some 	 how 	 	felt	that	it	would	n't	catch	on	out	there	,	that	there	would	be	a	problem	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	fine	-	art	 care 	 er 	 	.
and	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 suck 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 gen 	 re 	 	of	the	calendar	picture	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	of	that	nature	,	and	i	could	n't	get	away	from	it	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	of	,	how	can	i	 re 	 think 	 	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	?
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 re 	 think 	 	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	that	we	've	 transform 	 ed 	 	.
i	had	a	bit	of	an	 epiph 	 any 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	lost	in	pennsylvania	,	and	i	took	a	left	turn	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	back	to	the	 high 	 way 	 	.
and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	a	town	 call 	 ed 	 	frackville	.
i	got	out	of	the	car	,	and	i	stood	up	,	and	it	was	a	coal	-	 min 	 ing 	 	town	.	i	did	a	360	 turn 	 around 	 	,	and	that	 be 	 came 	 	one	of	the	most	surreal	 land 	 scapes 	 	i	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
 total 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	by	man	.
and	that	got	me	to	go	out	and	look	at	 mine 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	go	out	and	look	at	the	largest	industrial	 incur 	 s 	 ions 	 	in	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	that	i	could	find	.
and	that	 be 	 came 	 	the	 base 	 line 	 	of	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	theme	that	i	felt	that	i	could	hold	onto	,	and	not	have	to	re	-	invent	 my 	 self 	 	--	that	 th 	 is 	 	theme	was	large	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	life	's	work	,	to	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	could	sink	my	 tee 	 th 	 	 in 	 to 	 	and	just	research	and	find	out	where	these	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	are	.
and	i	think	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	in	my	 thank 	 s 	 	,	which	i	kind	of	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	,	was	to	thank	all	the	 corporation 	 s 	 	who	 help 	 ed 	 	me	get	in	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	took	 negoti 	 ation 	 	for	 al 	 most 	 	every	one	of	these	 photograph 	 s 	 	--	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	that	place	to	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	and	if	it	was	n't	for	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 lett 	 ing 	 	me	in	at	the	 head 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 corporation 	 s 	 	,	i	would	have	never	made	 th 	 is 	 	body	of	work	.
so	in	that	respect	,	to	me	,	i	'm	not	against	the	corporation	.
i	own	a	corporation	.	i	work	with	them	,	and	i	feel	that	we	all	need	them	and	they	're	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	i	am	 al 	 so 	 	for	 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
so	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	thing	that	is	 pull 	 ing 	 	me	in	both	 direction 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	making	an	 in 	 dict 	 ment 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	,	but	it	is	a	 s 	 low 	 	 progress 	 ion 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	well	,	we	live	in	all	these	 age 	 s 	 	of	man	:	the	stone	age	,	and	the	iron	age	,	and	the	 cop 	 per 	 	age	.
and	these	 age 	 s 	 	of	man	are	still	at	work	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	from	them	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	not	 see 	 ing 	 	there	.
and	it	's	a	 scar 	 y 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	start	looking	at	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	 appetit 	 e 	 	for	our	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	,	and	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	that	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	--	that	,	to	me	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 sober 	 ing 	 	moment	for	me	to	 contempl 	 ate 	 	.
and	through	my	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	be	able	to	engage	the	 audience 	 s 	 	of	my	work	,	and	to	come	up	to	it	and	not	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	be	 reject 	 ed 	 	by	the	image	.
not	to	say	,	``	oh	my	god	,	what	is	it	?	``	but	to	be	 challeng 	 ed 	 	by	it	--	to	say	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	``	on	one	level	,	but	on	the	other	level	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 scar 	 y 	 	.	i	should	n't	be	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	it	.	``
like	a	 forbid 	 den 	 	pleasure	.	and	it	's	that	 forbid 	 den 	 	pleasure	that	i	think	is	what	 reson 	 ates 	 	out	there	,	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	people	to	look	at	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	people	to	enter	it	.	and	it	 al 	 so 	 	,	in	a	way	,	 define 	 s 	 	kind	of	what	i	feel	,	too	--	that	i	'm	drawn	to	have	a	good	life	.
i	want	a	house	,	and	i	want	a	car	.
but	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	out	there	.
and	how	do	i	begin	to	have	that	 attract 	 ion 	 	,	 re 	 pulsion 	 	?
it	's	even	in	my	own	 con 	 science 	 	i	'm	 hav 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	here	in	my	work	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	that	same	toggle	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 photograph 	 ed 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	tire	pile	here	had	45	million	 tire 	 s 	 	in	it	.	it	was	the	largest	one	.
it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	about	an	hour	-	and	-	a	-	half	away	from	me	,	and	it	caught	fire	about	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	it	's	around	westley	,	california	,	around	modesto	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	start	looking	at	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	to	me	,	had	--	if	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	work	of	looking	at	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	had	a	sense	of	lament	to	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	to	nature	,	in	the	 recycl 	 ing 	 	work	that	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	point	to	a	direction	.	to	me	,	it	was	our	 re 	 de 	 mption 	 	.
that	in	the	 recycl 	 ing 	 	work	that	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	i	'm	looking	for	a	practice	,	a	human	activity	that	is	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
that	if	we	keep	 put 	 ting 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	through	industrial	and	urban	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	--	if	we	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	that	--	we	can	 continu 	 e 	 	on	.
of	course	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	at	the	 con 	 ference 	 	,	there	's	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	coming	.	bio	-	mimicry	,	and	there	's	 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	coming	on	stream	--	 nano 	 technology 	 	that	may	 al 	 so 	 	prevent	us	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	that	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	and	tear	it	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	we	all	look	forward	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 scal 	 ing 	 	up	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	happen	.
what	you	're	looking	at	here	--	i	went	to	bangladesh	,	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	move	away	from	north	america	;	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	our	world	 global 	 ly 	 	.
these	 image 	 s 	 	of	bangladesh	came	out	of	a	radio	program	i	was	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	exxon	valdez	,	and	that	there	was	going	to	be	a	glut	of	oil	 tank 	 ers 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
and	that	 t 	 hose 	 	oil	 tank 	 ers 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	 de 	 commission 	 ed 	 	,	and	2004	was	going	to	be	the	pinnacle	.
and	i	thought	,	``	my	god	,	would	n't	that	be	 some 	 thing 	 	?	``
to	see	the	largest	 vessel 	 s 	 	of	man	 be 	 ing 	 	 de 	 construct 	 ed 	 	by	hand	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	in	third	-	world	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	 original 	 ly 	 	i	was	going	to	go	to	india	.
and	i	was	shut	out	of	india	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	greenpeace	 situ 	 ation 	 	there	,	and	then	i	was	able	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	bangladesh	,	and	saw	for	the	first	time	a	third	world	,	a	view	of	it	,	that	i	had	never	 actual 	 ly 	 	thought	was	possible	.
130	million	people	living	in	an	area	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	wisconsin	--	people	 every 	 where 	 	--	the	 poll 	 ution 	 	was	 intens 	 e 	 	,	and	the	 work 	 ing 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	.
here	you	're	looking	at	some	oil	 field 	 s 	 	in	california	,	some	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	oil	 field 	 s 	 	.	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	that	--	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	 epiph 	 any 	 	--	that	the	whole	world	i	was	living	in	was	a	result	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	oil	.
and	that	,	to	me	,	was	 aga 	 in 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	building	on	,	and	i	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	build	on	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 eries 	 	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	have	ready	in	about	two	or	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	under	the	 head 	 ing 	 	of	``	the	oil	party	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	--	our	 cloth 	 ing 	 	,	our	 car 	 s 	 	,	our	 road 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	--	are	 direct 	 ly 	 	a	result	.
i	'm	going	to	move	to	some	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	for	me	 chin 	 a 	 	--	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 photograph 	 ing 	 	it	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	 chin 	 a 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	is	a	question	of	 sustain 	 ability 	 	in	my	mind	,	not	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	great	effect	on	the	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	that	i	grew	up	around	.
i	came	out	of	a	blue	-	collar	town	,	a	gm	town	,	and	my	father	 work 	 ed 	 	at	gm	,	so	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	that	kind	of	industry	and	that	 al 	 so 	 	 inform 	 ed 	 	my	work	.	but	you	know	,	to	see	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	scale	at	which	it	's	 evolv 	 ing 	 	,	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	what	you	see	here	is	the	three	gorges	dam	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	largest	dam	by	50	percent	ever	 attempt 	 ed 	 	by	man	.
most	of	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	around	the	world	left	the	project	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	just	too	big	.	``
in	fact	,	when	it	did	 actual 	 ly 	 	fill	with	water	a	year	and	a	half	ago	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	measure	a	 wo 	 bble 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	earth	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	 s 	 pinning 	 	.
it	took	fifteen	 day 	 s 	 	to	fill	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	reservoir	600	 kilometer 	 s 	 	long	,	one	of	the	largest	 reservoir 	 s 	 	ever	 create 	 d 	 	.
and	what	was	 al 	 so 	 	one	of	the	 big 	 ger 	 	 project 	 s 	 	around	that	was	moving	13	full	-	 s 	 ize 	 	cities	up	out	of	the	reservoir	,	and	 flatten 	 ing 	 	all	the	 building 	 s 	 	so	they	could	make	way	for	the	 ship 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	``	before	and	after	.	``	so	that	was	before	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	10	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 demolish 	 ed 	 	by	hand	.
i	think	11	of	the	 building 	 s 	 	they	used	 dynam 	 ite 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	else	was	by	hand	.	that	was	10	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	idea	.
and	it	was	all	the	people	who	lived	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	taking	it	 a 	 part 	 	and	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	 get 	 ting 	 	paid	per	brick	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	cities	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	these	are	some	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	from	that	.
so	i	 s 	 pent 	 	about	three	 trip 	 s 	 	to	the	three	gorges	dam	,	looking	at	that	massive	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
and	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 bomb 	 ed 	 	-	out	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	but	it	is	n't	.
what	it	is	,	it	's	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	that	is	an	intentional	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	need	for	power	,	and	they	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	go	through	 th 	 is 	 	massive	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	scale	,	to	get	that	power	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	relief	for	what	's	going	on	in	 chin 	 a 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	on	the	table	right	now	,	there	's	27	nuclear	power	 station 	 s 	 	to	be	built	.
there	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	one	built	in	north	america	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	``	nimby	``	problem	--	``	not	in	my	 back 	 yard 	 	.	``
but	in	 chin 	 a 	 	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	no	,	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	in	27	in	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	.	``
and	coal	-	 burn 	 ing 	 	 furnace 	 s 	 	are	going	in	there	for	 hydro 	 electric 	 	power	 liter 	 ally 	 	 week 	 ly 	 	.
so	coal	 it 	 self 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	largest	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	three	gorges	--	a	lot	of	the	 agricultur 	 al 	 	land	that	you	see	there	on	the	left	was	 al 	 so 	 	lost	;	some	of	the	most	 fertil 	 e 	 	 agricultur 	 al 	 	land	was	lost	in	that	.
and	1.2	to	2	million	people	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 locate 	 d 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	you	're	looking	at	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	building	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	wushan	,	one	of	the	largest	cities	that	was	 re 	 locate 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	town	hall	for	the	city	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 re 	 building 	 	of	the	city	--	to	me	,	it	was	 s 	 ad 	 	to	see	that	they	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	grab	a	lot	of	,	i	guess	,	what	we	know	here	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	urban	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 park 	 s 	 	;	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	green	 space 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	density	living	on	the	side	of	a	hill	.
and	here	they	had	a	chance	to	 re 	 build 	 	cities	from	the	bottom	up	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	them	.
here	is	a	sign	that	,	 transl 	 ated 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	obey	the	birth	control	law	.
build	our	science	,	 civil 	 ized 	 	and	 advance 	 d 	 	idea	of	marriage	and	giving	birth	.	``
so	here	,	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 post 	 er 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	all	the	 trapping 	 s 	 	of	western	culture	.
you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 tuxedo 	 s 	 	,	the	 bouquet 	 s 	 	.
but	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	to	me	,	 frighten 	 ing 	 	about	the	picture	and	about	 th 	 is 	 	 bill 	 board 	 	is	the	 refine 	 ry 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
so	it	's	like	 marry 	 ing 	 	up	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	have	and	it	's	an	 adapt 	 ation 	 	of	our	way	of	life	,	full	stop	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	when	you	start	 see 	 ing 	 	that	kind	of	embrace	,	and	you	start	looking	at	them	 lead 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	 life 	 style 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 foot 	 print 	 	and	moving	 in 	 to 	 	an	urban	 life 	 style 	 	with	a	much	 high 	 er 	 	 foot 	 print 	 	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 sober 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	shot	in	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 square 	 s 	 	in	guangdong	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	a	lot	of	migrant	 work 	 ers 	 	are	coming	in	from	the	country	.
and	there	's	about	130	million	people	in	 migr 	 ation 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	urban	 center 	 s 	 	at	all	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	next	10	to	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	are	 expect 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	400	to	500	million	people	to	 migr 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	urban	 center 	 s 	 	like	shanghai	and	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 center 	 s 	 	.
the	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	are	--	the	 domestic 	 s 	 	are	 usual 	 ly 	 	--	you	can	tell	a	domestic	 factor 	 y 	 	by	the	fact	that	they	all	use	the	same	color	 uniform 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	pink	uniform	at	 th 	 is 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	.	it	's	a	shoe	 factor 	 y 	 	.
and	they	have	 dorm 	 s 	 	for	the	 work 	 ers 	 	.
so	they	 br 	 ing 	 	them	in	from	the	country	and	put	them	up	in	the	 dorm 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	shoe	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	the	yuyuan	shoe	 factor 	 y 	 	near	shenzhen	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	90,000	 employ 	 ees 	 	making	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	shift	change	,	one	of	three	.
there	's	two	 factor 	 ies 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	scale	in	the	same	town	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	with	45,000	,	so	every	lunch	,	there	's	about	12,000	coming	through	for	lunch	.
they	 s 	 it 	 	down	;	they	have	about	20	 minute 	 s 	 	.
the	next	round	 come 	 s 	 	in	.	it	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 work 	 force 	 	that	's	building	there	.	shanghai	--	i	'm	looking	at	the	urban	 renew 	 al 	 	in	shanghai	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	whole	area	that	will	be	 flatten 	 ed 	 	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 sky 	 scrap 	 ers 	 	in	the	next	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
what	's	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	shanghai	is	--	 chin 	 a 	 	is	changing	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	would	n't	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 hold 	 out 	 	.
they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	 den 	 gzahoos 	 	--	they	're	like	pin	 tack 	 s 	 	to	the	ground	.
they	wo	n't	move	.	they	're	not	 negoti 	 ating 	 	.
they	're	not	 get 	 ting 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	so	they	're	not	going	to	move	.
and	so	they	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	off	 un 	 til 	 	they	get	a	deal	with	them	.
and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	in	 get 	 ting 	 	better	 deal 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	most	of	them	are	 get 	 ting 	 	a	raw	deal	.
they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	put	out	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	--	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	even	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	are	 be 	 ing 	 	broken	up	and	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	in	the	 sub 	 urban 	 	 area 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	shanghai	.	but	these	are	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 guy 	 s 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	out	in	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 construction 	 	of	shanghai	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	the	largest	urban	-	 renew 	 al 	 	project	,	i	think	,	ever	 attempt 	 ed 	 	on	the	planet	.
and	then	the	embrace	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	're	 re 	 placing 	 	it	with	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	one	of	my	 wish 	 es 	 	,	and	i	never	 end 	 ed 	 	up	going	there	,	was	to	 some 	 how 	 	tell	them	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	better	ways	to	build	a	house	.
the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 collision 	 s 	 	of	 style 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	these	are	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 villa 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	like	right	now	,	they	're	just	moving	.
the	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	is	still	on	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 e 	 - 	 waste 	 	area	,	and	if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	in	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	on	the	big	print	,	you	'd	see	that	the	industry	--	 the 	 ir 	 	industry	--	they	're	all	 recycl 	 ing 	 	.
so	the	industry	's	 al 	 ready 	 	growing	around	these	new	 develop 	 ments 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	five	-	level	bridge	in	shanghai	.
shanghai	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	city	--	it	's	 expl 	 o 	 d 	 ing 	 	on	a	level	that	i	do	n't	think	any	city	 ha 	 s 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	.
in	fact	,	even	shenzhen	,	the	economic	zone	--	one	of	the	first	 one 	 s 	 	--	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	was	about	100,000	people	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	it	 boast 	 s 	 	about	10	to	11	million	.
so	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	idea	of	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 migr 	 ations 	 	and	the	speed	with	which	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	 taxi 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	built	by	volkswagen	.
there	's	9,000	of	them	here	,	and	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	built	for	most	of	the	big	cities	,	beijing	and	shanghai	,	shenzhen	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	even	the	domestic	car	market	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	taxi	market	.
and	what	we	would	see	here	 a 	 s 	 	a	 sub 	 urban 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	--	a	similar	thing	,	but	they	're	all	high	-	 rise 	 s 	 	.
so	they	'll	put	20	or	40	up	at	a	time	,	and	they	just	go	up	in	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	a	single	-	family	dwelling	would	go	up	here	in	an	area	.
and	the	density	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	point	out	is	that	when	i	saw	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 building 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	to	see	that	they	're	not	using	a	central	air	-	 condition 	 ing 	 	system	;	every	window	 ha 	 s 	 	an	air	 condition 	 er 	 	in	it	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	there	are	people	here	who	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	better	than	i	do	about	efficiencies	,	but	i	ca	n't	imagine	that	every	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	air	 condition 	 er 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	way	to	cool	a	building	on	 th 	 is 	 	scale	.
and	when	you	start	looking	at	that	,	and	then	you	start	 factor 	 ing 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	a	city	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	shanghai	,	it	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	forest	of	 sky 	 scrap 	 ers 	 	.
it	's	 breath 	 taking 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	speed	at	which	 th 	 is 	 	city	is	 transform 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	can	see	in	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	it	's	still	one	of	the	last	 area 	 s 	 	that	was	 be 	 ing 	 	held	up	.
right	now	that	's	all	 clear 	 ed 	 	out	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	about	eight	 month 	 s 	 	ago	--	and	high	-	 rise 	 s 	 	are	now	going	up	 in 	 to 	 	that	central	spot	.
so	a	 sky 	 scrap 	 er 	 	is	built	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 over 	 night 	 	in	shanghai	.
most	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	i	went	in	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	some	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	baosteel	,	right	 out 	 side 	 	of	shanghai	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	coal	supply	for	the	steel	 factor 	 y 	 	--	18	square	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
it	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	massive	operation	,	i	think	15,000	 work 	 ers 	 	,	five	 cupola 	 s 	 	,	and	the	sixth	one	's	coming	in	here	.
so	they	're	building	 ver 	 y 	 	large	blast	 furnace 	 s 	 	to	try	to	deal	with	the	demand	for	steel	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	three	of	the	visible	blast	 furnace 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	that	shot	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	looking	at	these	 image 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	constant	,	like	,	 ha 	 ze 	 	that	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	show	you	,	real	time	,	an	 assemble 	 r 	 	.	it	's	a	circuit	breaker	.
10	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	at	 th 	 is 	 	speed	.
i	think	one	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	we	here	are	facing	with	 chin 	 a 	 	,	is	that	they	're	using	a	lot	of	the	 lat 	 est 	 	production	technology	.
in	that	one	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	400	people	that	 work 	 ed 	 	on	the	floor	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 manage 	 r 	 	to	point	out	five	of	your	 fast 	 est 	 	 produce 	 rs 	 	,	and	then	i	went	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	each	one	of	them	for	about	15	or	20	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	 pick 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	woman	.
and	it	was	just	 light 	 ning 	 	fast	;	the	way	she	was	 work 	 ing 	 	was	 al 	 most 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
but	that	is	the	trick	that	they	've	got	right	now	,	that	they	're	winning	with	,	is	that	they	're	using	all	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 extr 	 usion 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	all	the	 component 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	play	,	but	the	 assem 	 bly 	 	is	where	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	--	the	country	 work 	 ers 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	work	.	they	want	to	work	.
there	's	a	massive	 back 	 log 	 	of	people	 want 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
that	condition	's	going	to	be	there	for	the	next	10	to	15	 year 	 s 	 	if	they	 real 	 ize 	 	what	they	want	,	which	is	,	you	know	,	400	to	500	million	more	people	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	cities	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	case	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	that	you	saw	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	shot	of	it	.
i	had	to	use	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	aperture	to	get	the	depth	of	field	.
i	had	to	have	them	freeze	for	10	 second 	 s 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	shot	.
it	took	me	five	fake	tries	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	just	going	.	to	 s 	 low 	 	them	down	was	 liter 	 ally 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	just	wound	up	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	all	day	long	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	 manage 	 r 	 	had	to	,	with	a	 ster 	 n 	 	voice	,	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	freeze	.	``
it	was	n't	too	bad	,	but	they	're	driven	to	produce	these	 thing 	 s 	 	at	an	 in 	 credible 	 	rate	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 text 	 ile 	 	mill	 do 	 ing 	 	synthetic	silk	,	an	oil	 by 	 product 	 	.
and	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	one	of	the	most	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 text 	 ile 	 	 mill 	 s 	 	.
there	are	500	of	these	 machine 	 s 	 	;	they	're	worth	about	200,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	each	.
so	you	have	about	12	people	running	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	're	just	 inspect 	 ing 	 	it	--	and	they	're	just	 walk 	 ing 	 	the	lines	.
the	 machine 	 s 	 	are	all	running	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	to	see	what	the	scale	of	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	are	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	in	further	and	further	 in 	 to 	 	the	 factor 	 ies 	 	.
and	that	's	a	 dip 	 ty 	 ch 	 	.	i	do	a	lot	of	 pair 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	try	and	get	the	sense	of	scale	in	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	line	where	they	get	the	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	and	they	wind	the	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	together	,	pre	-	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	 text 	 ile 	 	 mill 	 s 	 	.
here	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	far	more	labor	-	intensive	,	which	is	the	making	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	floor	 ha 	 s 	 	about	1,500	 work 	 ers 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	floor	.
the	company	 it 	 self 	 	had	about	10,000	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	domestic	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	to	get	 per 	 mission 	 	from	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	nike	and	adidas	,	and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	get	.
and	they	do	n't	want	to	let	me	in	.
but	the	domestic	was	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	do	.
it	just	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	sense	of	,	 aga 	 in 	 	--	and	that	's	where	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	whole	 migr 	 ation 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	going	over	to	 chin 	 a 	 	and	making	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	.	nike	was	one	of	the	early	 one 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	high	labor	component	to	it	that	it	made	a	lot	of	sense	to	go	after	that	labor	market	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	high	-	tech	mobile	phone	:	bird	mobile	phone	,	one	of	the	largest	mobile	makers	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
i	think	mobile	phone	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 pop 	 ping 	 	up	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	on	a	 week 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	,	and	they	have	an	explosive	growth	in	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 text 	 ile 	 	where	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 shirt 	 s 	 	--	youngor	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	shirt	 factor 	 y 	 	and	 cloth 	 ing 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	next	shot	here	is	one	of	the	 lunch 	 rooms 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	.
while	setting	up	 th 	 is 	 	shot	,	people	on	average	would	 s 	 pend 	 	eight	to	10	 minute 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	lunch	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 factor 	 ies 	 	i	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
they	make	 coffee 	 makers 	 	here	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 coffee 	 maker 	 	and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	iron	makers	--	they	make	20	million	of	them	in	the	world	.
there	's	21,000	 employ 	 ees 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	one	 factor 	 y 	 	--	and	they	had	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	them	--	is	half	a	kilometer	long	.
these	are	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	shot	--	i	just	came	back	about	a	month	ago	,	so	you	're	the	first	 one 	 s 	 	to	be	 see 	 ing 	 	these	,	these	new	 factor 	 y 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	i	've	taken	.
so	it	's	taken	me	 al 	 most 	 	a	year	to	gain	access	 in 	 to 	 	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
the	other	 a 	 spect 	 	of	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	is	that	there	's	a	real	need	for	 material 	 s 	 	there	.
so	a	lot	of	the	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	that	are	 collect 	 ed 	 	here	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 recycl 	 ed 	 	and	taken	to	 chin 	 a 	 	by	 ship 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 cub 	 ed 	 	metal	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ar 	 mature 	 s 	 	,	 electric 	 al 	 	 ar 	 mature 	 s 	 	,	where	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 cop 	 per 	 	and	the	high	-	end	steel	from	 electric 	 al 	 	 motor 	 s 	 	out	,	and	 recycl 	 ing 	 	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	california	and	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	most	of	the	 computer 	 s 	 	.
fifty	percent	of	the	world	's	 computer 	 s 	 	end	up	in	 chin 	 a 	 	to	be	 recycl 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 refer 	 red 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	``	 e 	 - 	 waste 	 	``	there	.
and	it	is	a	bit	of	a	problem	.	the	way	they	 re 	 cycle 	 	the	 board 	 s 	 	is	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	the	coal	 briquette 	 s 	 	,	which	are	used	all	through	 chin 	 a 	 	,	but	they	heat	up	the	 board 	 s 	 	,	and	with	 pair 	 s 	 	of	 pli 	 ers 	 	they	pull	off	all	the	 component 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	all	the	 valu 	 ed 	 	 metal 	 s 	 	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 component 	 s 	 	.
but	the	toxic	 smell 	 s 	 	--	when	you	come	 in 	 to 	 	a	town	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 burn 	 ing 	 	of	the	 board 	 s 	 	,	you	can	smell	it	a	good	five	or	10	 kilometer 	 s 	 	before	you	get	there	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	operation	.	it	's	all	cottage	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	,	so	it	's	not	big	 place 	 s 	 	--	it	's	all	in	people	's	front	 porch 	 es 	 	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 back 	 yard 	 s 	 	,	even	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	they	're	 burn 	 ing 	 	 board 	 s 	 	,	if	there	's	a	concern	for	 some 	 body 	 	coming	by	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 consider 	 ed 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	to	be	 il 	 legal 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	but	they	ca	n't	stop	the	product	from	coming	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	portrait	--	i	'm	not	 usual 	 ly 	 	known	for	 portrait 	 s 	 	,	but	i	could	n't	resist	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	where	she	's	 be 	 en 	 	through	mao	,	and	she	's	 be 	 en 	 	through	the	great	leap	forward	,	and	the	cultural	revolution	,	and	now	she	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	her	porch	with	 th 	 is 	 	 e 	 - 	 waste 	 	 be 	 side 	 	her	.	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	road	where	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 shore 	 d 	 	up	by	computer	 board 	 s 	 	in	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 town 	 s 	 	where	they	're	 recycl 	 ing 	 	.
so	that	's	the	 photograph 	 s 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	.
i	want	to	dedicate	my	 wish 	 es 	 	to	my	two	 girl 	 s 	 	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	my	shoulder	the	whole	time	while	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
one	's	megan	,	the	one	of	the	right	,	and	katja	there	.
and	to	me	the	whole	 not 	 ion 	 	--	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	'm	 photograph 	 ing 	 	are	out	of	a	great	concern	about	the	scale	of	our	progress	and	what	we	call	progress	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	great	 thing 	 s 	 	around	the	corner	--	and	it	's	 palp 	 able 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	of	all	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	just	about	to	break	that	can	solve	so	 man 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	will	spread	around	the	world	and	will	start	to	have	a	positive	effect	.
and	it	is	n't	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	n't	just	 affect 	 ing 	 	our	world	,	but	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	go	up	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	we	can	start	 correct 	 ing 	 	our	 foot 	 print 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	down	--	but	there	's	a	growing	 foot 	 print 	 	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	and	is	growing	at	a	rapid	,	rapid	rate	,	and	so	i	do	n't	think	we	can	 equal 	 ize 	 	it	.	so	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	the	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	i	think	,	here	is	that	we	have	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	evolution	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	going	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	our	evolution	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	part	of	my	 think 	 ing 	 	,	and	part	of	my	 wish 	 es 	 	,	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	with	these	 thought 	 s 	 	in	mind	,	and	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	``	how	is	 the 	 ir 	 	life	going	to	be	when	they	want	to	have	children	,	or	when	they	're	ready	to	get	married	20	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	--	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	?	``
and	to	me	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	core	 be 	 hind 	 	most	of	my	 think 	 ing 	 	--	in	my	work	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	chance	to	have	some	 wish 	 es 	 	.
wish	one	:	world	-	changing	.	i	want	to	use	my	 image 	 s 	 	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	to	join	in	the	global	conversation	on	 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
and	it	is	through	 communication 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	that	is	not	an	 un 	 real 	 	idea	.
oh	,	and	i	went	in	search	--	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	what	i	had	in	mind	,	hitch	it	onto	 some 	 thing 	 	.	i	did	n't	want	a	wish	just	to	start	from	 no 	 where 	 	.
one	of	them	i	'm	 start 	 ing 	 	from	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	but	the	other	one	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	out	what	's	going	on	that	's	 work 	 ing 	 	right	now	.
and	worldchanging.com	is	a	fantastic	blog	,	and	that	blog	is	now	 be 	 ing 	 	 visit 	 ed 	 	by	close	to	half	-	a	-	million	people	a	month	.
and	it	just	 start 	 ed 	 	about	14	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	what	's	going	on	there	is	that	the	tone	of	the	conversation	is	the	tone	that	i	like	.
what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	there	is	that	they	're	not	--	i	think	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	in	that	it	's	used	the	stick	too	much	;	it	's	used	the	 apocalyp 	 tic 	 	tone	too	much	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 s 	 old 	 	the	positive	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 ally 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	pull	us	out	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	that	is	going	on	in	 th 	 is 	 	blog	is	about	positive	 move 	 ments 	 	,	about	how	to	change	our	world	in	a	better	way	,	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	's	looking	at	technology	,	and	it	's	looking	at	new	energy	-	saving	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	looking	at	how	to	 re 	 think 	 	and	how	to	re	-	strategize	the	 move 	 ment 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
and	so	for	me	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	thought	would	be	to	put	some	of	my	work	in	the	service	of	promoting	the	worldchanging.com	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
some	of	you	might	know	,	he	's	a	tedster	--	stephen	sagmeister	and	i	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	some	 lay 	 out 	 s 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	still	in	 pre 	 liminary 	 	 stage 	 s 	 	;	these	are	n't	the	 final 	 s 	 	.	but	these	 image 	 s 	 	,	with	worldchanging.com	,	can	be	 place 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	any	kind	of	media	.
they	could	be	 post 	 ed 	 	through	the	web	;	they	could	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bill 	 board 	 	or	a	bus	shelter	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	of	that	nature	.
so	we	're	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	out	.
and	what	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 discuss 	 ing 	 	was	that	in	most	media	you	get	 most 	 ly 	 	an	image	with	a	lot	of	text	,	and	the	text	is	 blast 	 ed 	 	all	over	.
what	was	 un 	 usual 	 	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	stephen	,	is	less	than	five	percent	of	 ad 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	with	image	.
and	so	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	about	a	lot	of	these	 image 	 s 	 	and	what	they	represent	,	and	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	they	 br 	 ing 	 	up	,	that	we	thought	 lett 	 ing 	 	the	 image 	 s 	 	play	out	and	 br 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	to	say	,	``	well	,	what	's	worldchanging.com	,	with	these	 image 	 s 	 	,	have	to	do	?	``
and	 hope 	 fully 	 	inspire	people	to	go	to	that	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
so	worldchanging.com	,	and	building	that	blog	,	and	it	is	a	blog	,	and	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	it	is	n't	--	i	do	n't	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	the	kind	of	blog	where	we	're	all	going	to	follow	each	other	to	death	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	one	that	will	spoke	out	,	and	will	go	out	,	and	to	start	 reach 	 ing 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	right	now	there	's	 conversation 	 s 	 	in	india	,	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	in	south	america	--	there	's	 ent 	 ries 	 	coming	from	all	around	the	world	.
i	think	there	's	a	chance	to	have	a	 dial 	 ogue 	 	,	a	conversation	about	 sustain 	 ability 	 	at	worldchanging.com	.
and	 any 	 thing 	 	that	you	can	do	to	promote	that	would	be	fantastic	.
wish	two	is	more	of	the	bottom	-	up	,	ground	-	up	one	that	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	work	with	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	:	i	wish	to	launch	a	 ground 	 break 	 ing 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	that	 motiv 	 ates 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	invest	 idea 	 s 	 	on	,	and	invent	 idea 	 s 	 	on	,	 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	came	out	--	allison	,	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 nominate 	 d 	 	me	,	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	on	in	a	 brain 	 storm 	 ing 	 	.	she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 recycl 	 ing 	 	in	canada	had	a	fantastic	entry	 in 	 to 	 	our	 psych 	 e 	 	through	 kid 	 s 	 	between	grade	four	and	six	.
and	you	think	about	it	,	you	know	,	grade	four	--	my	wife	and	i	,	we	say	age	seven	is	the	age	of	reason	,	so	they	're	 in 	 to 	 	the	age	of	reason	.	and	they	're	pre	-	puberty	.
so	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	great	window	where	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	--	you	can	influence	them	.	you	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	at	puberty	?
you	know	,	we	know	that	from	 ear 	 lier 	 	 present 	 ations 	 	.
so	my	 think 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	we	try	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	start	 driv 	 ing 	 	home	 idea 	 s 	 	.	let	them	understand	what	 sustain 	 ability 	 	is	,	and	that	they	have	a	 vest 	 ed 	 	interest	in	it	to	happen	.
and	one	of	the	ways	i	thought	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	is	to	use	my	prize	,	so	i	would	take	30,000	or	40,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	the	 winning 	 s 	 	,	and	the	rest	is	going	to	be	to	manage	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	but	to	use	that	 a 	 s 	 	 prize 	 s 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
but	the	other	thing	that	i	thought	would	be	fantastic	was	to	create	these	--	call	them	``	prize	 target 	 s 	 	.	``
and	so	one	could	be	for	the	best	 sustain 	 able 	 	idea	for	an	in	-	school	project	,	the	best	one	for	a	 house 	 hold 	 	project	,	or	it	could	be	the	best	community	project	for	 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	thought	there	should	be	a	nice	prize	for	the	best	 art 	 work 	 	for	``	in	my	world	.	``	and	what	would	happen	--	it	's	a	 scal 	 able 	 	thing	.	and	if	we	can	get	people	to	put	in	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	like	a	media	lab	,	or	money	to	make	the	prize	significant	 en 	 ough 	 	--	and	to	open	it	up	to	all	the	 school 	 s 	 	that	are	public	 school 	 s 	 	,	or	 school 	 s 	 	that	are	with	 kid 	 s 	 	that	age	,	and	make	it	a	wide	-	open	 com 	 petition 	 	for	them	to	go	after	 t 	 hose 	 	 prize 	 s 	 	and	to	submit	them	.
and	the	prize	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 ver 	 ifiable 	 	thing	,	so	it	's	not	about	just	 idea 	 s 	 	.
the	art	 piece 	 s 	 	are	about	the	 idea 	 s 	 	and	how	they	present	them	and	do	them	,	but	the	actual	 thing 	 s 	 	have	to	be	 ver 	 ifiable 	 	.
in	that	way	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	're	 motiv 	 ating 	 	a	certain	age	group	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	're	going	to	push	that	up	,	from	the	bottom	--	up	 in 	 to 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	.	and	 parent 	 s 	 	will	be	 react 	 ing 	 	to	it	,	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	them	with	the	 project 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	the	whole	idea	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 sustain 	 ability 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	positive	way	,	and	 start 	 s 	 	to	teach	them	.	they	know	about	 recycl 	 ing 	 	now	,	but	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	,	i	think	,	get	 sustain 	 ability 	 	in	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	the	energy	 foot 	 print 	 	,	and	how	that	 matter 	 s 	 	.
and	to	teach	them	,	to	me	,	would	be	a	fantastic	wish	,	and	it	would	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	would	 certain 	 ly 	 	put	my	shoulder	 in 	 to 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	``	in	my	world	,	``	the	 com 	 petition 	 	--	we	would	use	the	 art 	 work 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	in	from	that	 com 	 petition 	 	to	promote	it	.
and	i	like	the	 word 	 s 	 	,	``	in	my	world	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 give 	 s 	 	 possess 	 ion 	 	of	the	world	to	the	person	who	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
it	is	my	world	;	it	's	not	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	.	i	want	to	help	it	;	i	want	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	it	.	so	i	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	great	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	engage	the	 imagin 	 ations 	 	--	and	great	 idea 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	come	from	 kid 	 s 	 	--	and	engage	 the 	 ir 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	project	,	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	for	 school 	 s 	 	.
i	think	all	 school 	 s 	 	could	use	extra	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	extra	cash	--	it	's	going	to	be	an	incentive	for	them	to	do	that	.
and	these	are	some	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	where	we	could	possibly	put	in	some	 pro 	 motion 	 	for	``	in	my	world	.	``
and	wish	three	is	:	imax	film	.	so	i	was	told	i	should	do	one	for	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 involve 	 d 	 	with	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	the	scale	of	my	work	,	and	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	i	'm	 play 	 ing 	 	with	--	when	i	first	saw	an	imax	film	,	i	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	thought	,	``	there	's	a	real	 reson 	 ance 	 	between	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	and	the	scale	of	what	i	try	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	a	 photograph 	 er 	 	.	``
and	i	think	there	's	a	real	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	reach	new	 audience 	 s 	 	if	i	had	a	chance	.
so	i	'm	looking	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	for	a	mentor	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	just	had	my	 birth 	 day 	 	.
i	'm	50	,	and	i	do	n't	have	time	to	go	back	to	school	right	now	--	i	'm	too	 bus 	 y 	 	.	so	i	need	 some 	 body 	 	who	can	put	me	on	a	quick	catch	-	up	course	on	how	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	and	lead	me	through	the	maze	of	how	one	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
that	would	be	fantastic	.	so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	my	three	 wish 	 es 	 	.
