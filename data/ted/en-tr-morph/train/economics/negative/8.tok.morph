kurt	andersen	:	like	 man 	 y 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	,	david	is	a	hog	for	the	 lime 	 light 	 	but	is	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	 re 	 tic 	 ent 	 	--	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	 pretend 	 s 	 	to	be	--	that	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	question	him	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 s 	 peaking 	 	.
in	fact	what	we	're	going	to	talk	about	,	i	think	,	is	in	fact	a	subject	that	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	better	 serv 	 ed 	 	by	a	conversation	than	an	address	.
and	i	guess	we	have	a	bit	of	news	clip	to	precede	.
dan	 ra 	 ther 	 	:	since	the	september	11th	attack	on	the	world	trade	center	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 flock 	 ed 	 	to	 down 	 town 	 	new	york	to	see	and	pay	 respect 	 s 	 	at	what	 amount 	 s 	 	to	the	16	-	acre	burial	ground	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	cbs	's	jim	axelrod	 report 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 finish 	 ing 	 	 touch 	 es 	 	on	a	new	way	for	people	to	visit	and	view	the	scene	.
jim	axelrod	:	forget	the	empire	state	building	or	the	statue	of	 liber 	 ty 	 	.
there	's	a	new	place	in	new	york	where	the	 crowd 	 s 	 	are	 thick 	 est 	 	--	ground	zero	.
tourist	:	i	've	taken	my	step	-	daughter	here	from	indianapolis	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	--	out	of	all	the	tourist	 s 	 ites 	 	in	new	york	city	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	her	number	-	one	pick	.
ja	:	 thousand 	 s 	 	now	line	up	on	lower	broadway	.
tourist	:	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 want 	 ing 	 	to	come	down	here	since	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
ja	:	even	on	the	 cold 	 est 	 	winter	 day 	 s 	 	.
to	honor	and	remember	.
tourist	:	it	's	 re 	 ality 	 	,	it	's	us	.	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 our 	 s 	 	.
ja	:	so	 man 	 y 	 	,	in	fact	,	that	 see 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	bit	of	a	problem	.
tourist	:	i	think	that	people	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	that	they	're	not	able	to	get	 close 	 r 	 	to	see	what	's	going	on	.
ja	:	but	that	is	about	to	change	.
in	record	time	,	a	team	of	 architect 	 s 	 	and	construction	 work 	 ers 	 	designed	and	built	a	 view 	 ing 	 	platform	to	ease	the	 frust 	 ration 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	people	 close 	 r 	 	.
man	:	they	'll	get	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 pan 	 or 	 ama 	 	and	understand	,	i	think	more	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	the	 she 	 er 	 	 total 	 ity 	 	of	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	place	.
ja	:	if	you	think	about	it	,	ground	zero	is	 un 	 like 	 	most	any	other	tourist	 s 	 ite 	 	in	america	.
 un 	 like 	 	the	grand	canyon	or	the	washington	monument	,	people	come	here	to	see	what	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	there	.
david	rockwell	:	the	first	experience	people	will	have	here	when	they	see	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	construction	 s 	 ite 	 	but	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	moving	burial	ground	.
ja	:	the	 wall 	 s 	 	are	bare	by	design	,	so	people	can	fill	them	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 memorial 	 s 	 	the	way	they	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 a 	 long 	 	the	current	 peri 	 meter 	 	.
tourist	:	from	our	 heart 	 s 	 	,	it	 affect 	 ed 	 	us	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	.
ja	:	the	 ramp 	 s 	 	are	made	of	simple	material	--	the	kind	of	 ply 	 wood 	 	you	see	at	construction	 s 	 ites 	 	--	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	whole	point	.
in	the	face	of	america	's	worst	 destruct 	 ion 	 	people	are	building	 aga 	 in 	 	.
jim	axelrod	,	cbs	news	,	new	york	.
ka	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	obvious	subject	to	be	in	the	 sensual 	 ity 	 	segment	,	but	 certain 	 ly 	 	david	you	are	known	 a 	 s 	 	--	i	know	,	a	phrase	you	hate	--	an	 entertain 	 ment 	 	architect	.
your	work	is	 high 	 ly 	 	sensual	,	even	 hedon 	 istic 	 	.
dr	:	i	like	that	word	.
ka	:	it	's	about	pleasure	--	 casino 	 s 	 	and	 hotel 	 s 	 	and	 restaurant 	 s 	 	.
how	did	the	shock	that	all	of	us	--	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	all	of	us	in	new	york	--	felt	on	the	11th	of	september	 trans 	 mute 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	 desir 	 e 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	thing	?
dr	:	well	the	truth	of	the	matter	is	,	post	-	september	11th	,	i	felt	 my 	 self 	 	in	the	role	 original 	 ly 	 	--	first	of	all	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	who	 live 	 s 	 	in	tribeca	and	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	was	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	less	than	a	mile	from	there	--	that	i	was	in	the	role	of	forcing	100	people	who	work	with	me	in	my	firm	,	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	have	the	same	level	of	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	about	creating	the	 place 	 s 	 	we	had	 be 	 en 	 	creating	.
in	fact	we	're	 finish 	 ing 	 	a	book	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	pleasure	,	``	which	is	about	sensual	pleasure	in	 space 	 s 	 	.
but	i	've	got	to	tell	you	--	it	 be 	 came 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	do	that	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
and	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	the	friday	after	september	11th	--	two	 day 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	 un 	 able 	 	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	 any 	 one 	 	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
we	 g 	 ave 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	off	.
and	in	 discuss 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	other	 architect 	 s 	 	,	we	had	 s 	 een 	 	people	 say 	 ing 	 	in	the	press	that	they	should	 re 	 build 	 	the	 tower 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	--	they	should	 re 	 build 	 	them	50	 st 	 ories 	 	 tall 	 er 	 	.
and	i	thought	it	was	 astonish 	 ing 	 	to	 specul 	 ate 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	 com 	 petition 	 	,	on	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	fresh	wound	.
and	i	had	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 discuss 	 ions 	 	--	first	with	rick	scofidio	and	liz	diller	,	who	 collabor 	 ated 	 	with	us	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	other	people	--	and	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	like	we	had	to	find	relevance	in	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	that	 a 	 s 	 	people	who	create	 place 	 s 	 	,	the	ultimate	way	to	help	was	n't	to	 pont 	 ific 	 ate 	 	or	to	make	up	 scenario 	 s 	 	,	but	to	help	right	now	.
so	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	come	up	with	a	way	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	group	,	to	have	a	kind	of	design	swat	team	.
and	that	was	the	mission	that	we	came	up	with	.
ka	:	 we 	 re 	 	you	conscious	of	 sudden 	 ly 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	work	is	all	about	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	 want 	 s 	 	--	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	?
dr	:	well	what	i	was	aware	of	was	,	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	need	to	act	now	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	a	few	 project 	 s 	 	before	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	was	a	school	,	ps	234	,	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 evacuate 	 d 	 	down	at	ground	zero	.
they	 move 	 d 	 	to	an	 abandon 	 ed 	 	school	.
we	took	about	20	or	30	 architect 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	and	 artist 	 s 	 	,	and	over	four	 day 	 s 	 	--	it	was	like	 th 	 is 	 	urban	barn	-	raising	--	to	renovate	it	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	help	.
it	was	just	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
tom	otterness	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	,	maira	kalman	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	and	it	 be 	 came 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 cath 	 art 	 ic 	 	experience	for	us	.
ka	:	and	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	by	october	8	or	 some 	 thing 	 	?
dr	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
ka	:	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	what	you	 face 	 d 	 	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 sub 	 stantial 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	four	that	you	've	designed	to	surround	the	 s 	 ite 	 	--	you	must	have	run	up	against	the	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 by 	 zantine 	 	,	 en 	 trench 	 ed 	 	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	and	 power 	 s 	 	that	be	in	new	york	real	 e 	 state 	 	and	new	york	 politic 	 s 	 	.
dr	:	well	,	it	's	a	funny	thing	.
we	 finish 	 ed 	 	ps	234	,	and	had	 d 	 inner 	 	with	a	small	group	.
i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 commit 	 tee 	 	chair	on	an	aia	 commit 	 tee 	 	to	 re 	 build 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 at 	 	in	on	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	the	most	 circuit 	 ous 	 	grand	 plan 	 s 	 	that	had	to	do	with	long	-	term	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	 re 	 building 	 	the	entire	city	.
and	the	fact	is	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 	 wound 	 s 	 	and	 need 	 s 	 	that	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	 fill 	 ed 	 	,	and	there	was	talk	about	 in 	 clusion 	 	and	 want 	 ing 	 	it	to	be	an	inclusive	process	.
and	it	was	n't	an	inclusive	group	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	is	--	ka	:	it	was	not	an	inclusive	group	?
dr	:	it	was	not	an	inclusive	group	.
it	was	 pre 	 domin 	 ant 	 ly 	 	a	white	,	rich	,	corporate	group	that	was	not	 represent 	 ative 	 	of	the	city	.
ka	:	 shock 	 ing 	 	.
dr	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	surprising	.
so	rick	and	liz	and	kevin	and	i	came	up	with	the	idea	.
the	city	 actual 	 ly 	 	 approach 	 ed 	 	us	.
we	first	 approach 	 ed 	 	the	city	about	 pi 	 er 	 	94	.
we	saw	how	ps	234	 work 	 ed 	 	.
the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	--	the	 victim 	 s 	 	of	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	--	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 th 	 is 	 	 pi 	 er 	 	that	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 de 	 human 	 izing 	 	.
ka	:	on	the	hudson	river	?
dr	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	and	the	city	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	through	tim	zagat	 initi 	 ally 	 	,	and	then	through	christyne	nicholas	,	then	we	got	to	giuliani	--	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	we	do	n't	want	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	with	 pi 	 er 	 	94	right	now	,	but	we	have	an	 observ 	 ation 	 	platform	for	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	down	at	ground	zero	that	we	'd	like	to	be	a	more	 d 	 ign 	 ified 	 	experience	for	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	and	a	way	to	protect	it	from	the	weather	.	``
so	i	went	down	there	with	rick	and	liz	and	kevin	,	and	i	've	got	to	say	,	it	was	the	most	moving	experience	of	my	life	.
it	was	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	to	see	the	simple	 ply 	 wood 	 	platform	with	a	rail	around	it	,	where	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	of	the	 victim 	 s 	 	had	left	 note 	 s 	 	to	them	.
and	there	was	no	 media 	 tion 	 	between	us	and	the	experience	.
there	was	no	filter	.
and	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	on	september	11th	,	on	14th	street	,	the	roof	of	our	building	--	we	can	see	the	world	trade	 tower 	 s 	 	 prominent 	 ly 	 	--	and	i	saw	the	first	building	collapse	from	a	 con 	 ference 	 	room	on	the	eighth	floor	on	a	tv	that	we	had	set	up	.
and	then	 every 	 one 	 	was	up	on	the	roof	,	so	i	ran	up	there	.
and	it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	how	much	 hard 	 er 	 	it	was	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	real	life	than	it	was	on	tv	.
there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	comfort	of	the	filter	and	how	much	information	was	between	us	and	the	experience	.
so	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	 d 	 ign 	 ified 	 	way	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	experience	.
so	we	went	back	to	the	city	and	 s 	 aid 	 	we	're	not	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 up 	 grade 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	vip	platform	,	but	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	some	time	down	there	.
at	the	same	time	the	city	had	 th 	 is 	 	need	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	a	solution	to	deal	with	30	or	40	thousand	people	a	day	who	 we 	 re 	 	going	down	there	,	that	had	 no 	 where 	 	to	go	.
and	there	was	no	way	to	deal	with	the	traffic	around	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
so	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	it	is	just	an	 im 	 mediate 	 	master	plan	.
there	was	a	way	--	there	had	to	be	a	way	--	to	get	people	to	move	around	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
ka	:	but	then	you	've	got	to	figure	out	a	way	--	we	will	skip	over	the	 insan 	 e 	 ly 	 	 ted 	 ious 	 	process	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 permit 	 s 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 every 	 body 	 	on	board	--	but	 simpl 	 y 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	thing	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	half	a	million	dollar	project	?
dr	:	well	,	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	if	it	was	n't	 private 	 ly 	 	funded	,	it	was	n't	going	to	happen	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	 k 	 new 	 	that	if	it	did	n't	happen	by	the	end	of	the	giuliani	 administr 	 ation 	 	,	then	 every 	 one 	 	who	we	 we 	 re 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	at	the	dot	and	the	police	 depart 	 ment 	 	and	all	of	the	--	we	 we 	 re 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	20	or	30	people	with	the	city	at	a	time	,	and	it	was	set	up	by	the	 off 	 ice 	 	of	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	management	.
 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	act	on	 the 	 ir 	 	part	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	 sens 	 ed 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	happen	.
ka	:	and	there	was	 there 	 fore 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 tick 	 ing 	 	clock	,	 be 	 cause 	 	giuliani	was	 obvious 	 ly 	 	out	three	 month 	 s 	 	after	that	.
dr	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	so	the	first	thing	we	had	to	do	was	find	a	way	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	--	we	had	to	work	with	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	of	the	 victim 	 s 	 	,	through	the	city	,	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	 k 	 new 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	did	n't	want	to	be	a	surprise	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	had	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	under	the	radar	screen	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	be	in	new	york	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	key	was	not	raising	a	lot	of	 object 	 ion 	 	and	sort	of	 work 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 quiet 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
we	came	up	with	the	idea	of	setting	up	a	 found 	 ation 	 	,	 main 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	found	a	 contract 	 or 	 	who	would	build	 th 	 is 	 	,	he	would	not	agree	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	even	if	we	would	pay	him	the	money	.
there	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 found 	 ation 	 	in	place	.
so	we	came	up	with	a	 found 	 ation 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	one	major	 develop 	 er 	 	in	new	york	--	ka	:	who	 s 	 hall 	 	remain	 name 	 less 	 	,	i	guess	?
dr	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	his	 initi 	 al 	 s 	 	are	js	,	and	he	 own 	 s 	 	rockefeller	center	,	if	that	 help 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	--	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	to	help	.
and	we	met	with	him	.
the	 price 	 s 	 	from	the	 contract 	 ors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	between	five	to	700,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	atlantic	-	heydt	,	who	's	the	largest	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	 contract 	 or 	 	in	the	country	,	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	at	cost	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 develop 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	,	we	'll	 under 	 write 	 	the	entire	expense	.	``
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	 in 	 credible 	 	!	``
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	21st	,	and	we	 k 	 new 	 	 th 	 is 	 	had	to	be	built	and	up	by	the	28th	.
and	we	had	to	start	construction	the	next	day	.
we	had	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	that	 even 	 ing 	 	with	his	 contract 	 or 	 	of	choice	,	and	the	 contract 	 or 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	up	with	the	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	platform	about	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	that	we	had	drawn	it	.
ka	:	sort	of	like	the	 spin 	 al 	 	tap	scene	where	you	get	the	 tin 	 y 	 	little	stonehenge	,	i	guess	?
dr	:	in	fact	,	it	was	 a 	 s 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	going	to	be	window	-	 wash 	 ing 	 	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	.
there	was	no	sense	of	the	fact	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	next	to	saint	paul	--	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	place	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	kind	of	 d 	 ign 	 ified 	 	,	and	a	place	to	reflect	and	remember	.
and	i	've	got	to	say	that	we	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	 put 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	together	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	 crowd 	 s 	 	that	 gather 	 ed 	 	at	saint	paul	--	which	is	just	to	the	right	--	and	moving	around	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	i	live	down	there	,	so	we	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	looking	at	the	need	.
and	i	think	people	 we 	 re 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	at	two	 thing 	 s 	 	--	i	think	they	 we 	 re 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	at	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	but	i	think	there	was	a	sense	of	 dis 	 belief 	 	about	the	 hero 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	new	yorkers	that	i	found	 ver 	 y 	 	moving	.
just	the	sort	of	 every 	 day 	 	 hero 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	new	yorkers	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	and	the	 contract 	 or 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	lock	the	door	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 develop 	 er 	 	will	not	agree	to	have	you	 leav 	 e 	 	till	you	've	 sign 	 ed 	 	off	on	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	of	the	design	 feature 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	 up 	 on 	 	by	 every 	 one 	 	--	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	city	.
we	'd	have	to	go	back	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	i	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	him	that	we	should	 leav 	 e 	 	the	room	with	the	 agree 	 ment 	 	to	build	it	 a 	 s 	 	designed	.
the	next	day	i	got	an	email	from	the	 develop 	 er 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	he	was	 withdraw 	 ing 	 	all	 fund 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	did	n't	know	what	to	do	,	but	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	cast	a	 ver 	 y 	 	wide	net	.
we	 email 	 ed 	 	out	 letter 	 s 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	--	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	people	in	the	audience	here	--	who	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	.
ka	:	there	was	no	thought	of	 abandon 	 ing 	 	ship	at	that	point	?
dr	:	no	.	in	fact	i	told	the	 contract 	 or 	 	to	go	 a 	 head 	 	.
he	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 order 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	based	on	my	go	-	 a 	 head 	 	.
we	 k 	 new 	 	that	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	going	to	happen	.
and	we	just	felt	it	had	to	happen	.
ka	:	you	 we 	 re 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	it	 your 	 self 	 	and	with	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	.
richard	,	i	think	 ver 	 y 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	made	the	point	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	--	before	all	the	chair	 design 	 ers 	 	came	out	--	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	chair	 design 	 ers 	 	 im 	 posing 	 	aesthetic	 solution 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	universal	,	 ban 	 al 	 	,	common	problem	of	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	it	was	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	unprecedented	,	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 	design	problem	.
dr	:	well	here	's	the	issue	:	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	in	the	sense	of	--	we	think	about	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	think	about	the	need	for	a	memorial	.
it	was	 import 	 ant 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	not	be	 categor 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	memorial	.
that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	place	for	people	to	reflect	,	to	remember	--	a	kind	of	quiet	place	.
so	it	led	us	to	using	design	 solution 	 s 	 	that	 create 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	few	 filter 	 s 	 	between	the	 view 	 er 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	 s 	 aid 	 	about	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	'	platform	--	and	the	experience	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
it	's	all	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	humble	material	.
it	's	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	and	 ply 	 wood 	 	.
and	it	 allow 	 s 	 	--	by	sort	of	the	 process 	 ion 	 	of	the	 move 	 ment 	 	,	up	by	saint	paul	's	and	down	the	other	side	--	it	 give 	 s 	 	you	about	300	feet	to	go	up	13	feet	from	the	ground	to	where	you	get	the	360	degree	view	.
but	the	design	was	driven	by	a	need	to	be	quick	,	cheap	,	safe	,	 respect 	 ful 	 	,	 flex 	 ible 	 	.
one	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	designed	to	be	 move 	 able 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	four	 platform 	 s 	 	around	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	one	of	which	is	an	 up 	 grade 	 	of	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	'	platform	,	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	these	had	to	be	 move 	 able 	 	to	respond	to	changing	 condition 	 s 	 	,	and	the	changing	definition	of	what	ground	zero	is	.
ka	:	your	work	--	i	mean	,	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	before	--	a	lot	of	your	work	,	i	think	,	is	 inform 	 ed 	 	by	your	belief	in	,	or	your	focus	on	the	 tempor 	 ari 	 ness 	 	of	all	 thing 	 s 	 	and	the	 evanesc 	 ence 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	a	kind	of	``	eat	,	drink	,	and	be	merry	,	for	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	we	die	,	``	sort	of	sense	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	not	a	work	for	the	 age 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	n't	going	to	be	here	.
did	that	 requir 	 e 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	,	a	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	you	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	?
to	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	?
dr	:	no	,	i	do	n't	think	so	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	different	from	 any 	 thing 	 	we	'd	ever	thought	about	 do 	 ing 	 	before	,	just	by	the	nature	of	it	.
where	it	 over 	 lap 	 s 	 	with	 thought 	 s 	 	about	our	work	in	general	is	,	number	one	--	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 collabor 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	way	to	get	 thing 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	kevin	kennon	,	rick	scofidio	,	liz	diller	and	all	the	people	 with 	 in 	 	the	city	--	norman	lear	,	who	i	spoke	to	four	 hour 	 s 	 	before	our	 dead 	 line 	 	for	 fund 	 ing 	 	,	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	give	us	a	bridge	loan	to	help	us	get	through	it	.
so	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 collabor 	 ation 	 	--	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 reinforce 	 s 	 	how	 import 	 ant 	 	that	is	.
and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 tempor 	 ary 	 	nature	of	it	,	our	goal	was	not	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	be	there	 long 	 er 	 	than	it	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	.
i	think	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	most	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	was	promoting	a	kind	of	 dial 	 ogue 	 	that	we	felt	may	not	have	 be 	 en 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	city	,	about	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	there	.
and	a	day	or	two	before	it	 open 	 ed 	 	was	giuliani	's	 fare 	 well 	 	address	,	where	he	 pro 	 posed 	 	the	idea	of	all	of	ground	zero	 be 	 ing 	 	a	memorial	.
which	was	 ver 	 y 	 	controversial	,	but	it	 reson 	 ated 	 	with	a	lot	of	people	.
and	i	think	 regard 	 less 	 	of	what	the	position	is	about	how	 th 	 is 	 	sacred	piece	of	land	is	to	be	used	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	it	come	out	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	it	in	a	real	 en 	 counter 	 	,	i	think	 make 	 s 	 	it	a	more	 power 	 ful 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
so	that	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	is	in	the	realm	of	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	before	.
ka	:	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	a	 love 	 ly 	 	piece	of	civic	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
it	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	that	conversation	to	get	serious	.
and	six	 month 	 s 	 	after	the	fact	--	and	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	away	from	the	 s 	 ite 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 clean 	 ed 	 	--	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	now	,	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	point	where	 t 	 hose 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	about	what	should	go	there	are	 get 	 ting 	 	serious	.
do	you	have	--	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 physical 	 ly 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	 s 	 ite 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	--	have	any	 idea 	 s 	 	about	what	should	or	should	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	?
dr	:	well	,	i	think	one	thing	that	should	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	is	evaluate	--	i	think	right	now	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	closed	 discuss 	 ion 	 	on	the	master	plan	.
the	protetch	 gall 	 ery 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	had	a	show	on	 idea 	 s 	 	for	 building 	 s 	 	,	which	had	some	sort	of	 invent 	 ive 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	 building 	 s 	 	.
ka	:	but	it	had	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
dr	:	and	it	 al 	 so 	 	felt	a	little	bit	like	a	kind	of	 com 	 petition 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	where	i	think	the	focus	of	 idea 	 s 	 	should	be	on	master	 plan 	 ning 	 	and	uses	.
and	i	think	there	should	be	a	 broad 	 er 	 	--	which	there	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	be	--	the	 dial 	 ogue 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	up	to	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	be	?
and	i	 tru 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	issue	of	memorial	is	 sort 	 ed 	 	out	,	that	it	's	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	have	an	intelligent	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
there	's	a	few	 discuss 	 ions 	 	right	now	that	i	think	are	 ver 	 y 	 	positive	,	about	 depress 	 ing 	 	the	west	side	 high 	 way 	 	and	 connect 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	over	,	so	that	there	's	one	 un 	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	piece	of	land	.
ka	:	well	,	i	think	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	issue	that	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	 in 	 appropriate 	 	to	discuss	six	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	is	n't	now	,	which	is	,	not	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	love	the	world	trade	center	 a 	 s 	 	a	piece	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	what	it	had	 d 	 one 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	city	and	that	huge	plaza	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	is	the	silver	lining	--	a	silver	lining	,	here	--	to	 re 	 build 	 	some	more	 tradition 	 al 	 	city	grid	,	or	not	?
dr	:	i	think	there	's	a	real	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	engage	in	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	of	why	we	live	in	cities	.
and	why	do	we	live	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	 s 	 uch 	 	 dis 	 similar 	 	people	collide	up	against	us	each	day	?
i	do	n't	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	much	to	do	with	50	or	60	or	70	or	80	thousand	new	 off 	 ice 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	what	the	number	is	.
so	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	think	there	is	a	chance	to	re	-	look	at	how	we	think	about	cities	.
and	in	fact	,	there	's	a	proposal	on	the	table	now	for	building	number	seven	.
ka	:	which	was	the	building	just	north	of	the	 tower 	 s 	 	?
dr	:	right	,	which	the	 tower 	 s 	 	fell	 in 	 to 	 	.
and	the	reason	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	held	up	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	by	community	 out 	 rage 	 	that	they	're	not	re	-	 open 	 ing 	 	the	street	to	connect	that	back	to	the	rest	of	the	city	.
i	think	a	public	 dial 	 ogue 	 	--	i	think	,	you	know	,	i	'd	like	to	see	an	 inter 	 national 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	,	and	a	call	for	 idea 	 s 	 	for	uses	.
ka	:	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 art 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	housing	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	what	amount	of	 shop 	 ping 	 	?
dr	:	right	.	and	we	're	looking	for	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	small	 found 	 ation 	 	we	put	together	is	looking	for	other	ways	to	help	.
 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	taking	a	small	piece	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	and	 invit 	 ing 	 	10	 architect 	 s 	 	who	 current 	 ly 	 	do	n't	have	a	voice	in	new	york	to	do	artist	housing	.
and	find	other	ways	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	to	be	against	sort	of	 monolith 	 ic 	 	,	single	 solution 	 s 	 	,	and	more	about	a	 multi 	 plicit 	 y 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
ka	:	before	we	end	,	i	know	you	have	a	piece	of	digital	video	of	the	experience	of	 be 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	platform	?
dr	:	john	kamen	--	who	's	here	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	put	together	a	two	and	a	half	minute	piece	that	 show 	 s 	 	the	platform	in	use	.
so	i	thought	that	would	be	good	to	end	with	.
dr	:	we	're	looking	from	fulton	street	,	west	.
one	of	the	 trick 	 y 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	we	had	with	the	giuliani	 administr 	 ation 	 	was	i	had	 for 	 gotten 	 	how	anti	-	graffiti	he	was	.
and	 essential 	 ly 	 	our	structure	was	designed	to	be	written	on	.
ka	:	 a 	 s 	 	you	say	,	it	's	not	a	memorial	.
but	 we 	 re 	 	you	conscious	of	 memorial 	 s 	 	?	the	vietnam	memorial	?
 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 form 	 s 	 	?
dr	:	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	 a 	 s 	 	much	research	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	conscious	of	other	 memorial 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	length	of	time	they	 re 	 ally 	 	take	to	do	.
it	's	350	people	on	the	 commit 	 tee 	 	for	oklahoma	city	,	which	is	why	we	thought	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	ad	-	hoc	,	 spontane 	 ous 	 	solution	that	 expand 	 ed 	 	on	 un 	 ion 	 	square	and	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	ad	-	hoc	 memorial 	 s 	 	in	the	city	 al 	 ready 	 	.
the	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	you	can	see	built	up	over	the	street	is	de	-	mountable	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	now	is	the	nature	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	so	that	what	you	're	aware	of	is	not	just	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	 building 	 s 	 	in	ground	zero	,	but	all	of	the	 building 	 s 	 	around	it	--	and	the	 scar 	 s 	 	on	the	building	around	it	,	which	are	enormous	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	saint	paul	's	on	the	left	.
ka	:	i	just	want	to	thank	you	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	new	yorkers	for	making	 th 	 is 	 	happen	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
but	the	kind	of	 virtual 	 ly 	 	instantaneous	nature	of	 it 	 s 	 	 erect 	 ion 	 	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	there	,	 al 	 most 	 	before	you	could	 believ 	 e 	 	that	a	 respons 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 magn 	 itude 	 	could	be	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	,	is	part	of	 it 	 s 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	--	i	do	n't	know	if	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	the	word	--	but	presence	.
dr	:	it	was	an	honor	to	do	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 thrill 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	show	it	here	.
