good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
let	's	look	for	a	minute	at	the	 great 	 est 	 	icon	of	all	,	leonardo	da	vinci	.
we	're	all	familiar	with	his	fantastic	work	--	his	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	his	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	his	 invent 	 ions 	 	,	his	 writing 	 s 	 	.
but	we	do	not	know	his	face	.
 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	written	about	him	,	but	there	's	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	,	and	it	 remain 	 s 	 	,	about	his	 look 	 s 	 	.
even	 th 	 is 	 	well	-	known	portrait	is	not	 accept 	 ed 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	art	 historian 	 s 	 	.
so	,	what	do	you	think	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	the	face	of	leonardo	da	vinci	or	is	n't	it	?
let	's	find	out	.
leonardo	was	a	man	that	drew	 every 	 thing 	 	around	him	.
he	drew	people	,	anatomy	,	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	 building 	 s 	 	,	water	,	 every 	 thing 	 	.
but	no	 face 	 s 	 	?
i	find	that	hard	to	 believ 	 e 	 	.
his	 con 	 tempor 	 aries 	 	made	 face 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	you	see	here	--	en	face	or	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	a	passionate	 draw 	 er 	 	like	leonardo	must	have	made	self	-	 portrait 	 s 	 	from	time	to	time	.
so	let	's	try	to	find	them	.
i	think	that	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	 s 	 can 	 	all	of	his	work	and	look	for	self	-	 portrait 	 s 	 	,	we	would	find	his	face	looking	at	us	.
so	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	all	of	his	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	more	than	700	,	and	 look 	 ed 	 	for	male	 portrait 	 s 	 	.
there	are	about	120	,	you	see	them	here	.
which	 one 	 s 	 	of	these	could	be	self	-	 portrait 	 s 	 	?
well	,	for	that	they	have	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	just	saw	,	en	face	or	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
so	we	can	eliminate	all	the	 profile 	 s 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	.
so	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	eliminate	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	vague	or	 ver 	 y 	 	 styl 	 ized 	 	.
and	we	know	from	his	 con 	 tempor 	 aries 	 	that	leonardo	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 hand 	 some 	 	,	even	 beaut 	 iful 	 	man	.
so	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	eliminate	the	 ug 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	or	the	 caricatur 	 es 	 	.
and	look	what	 happen 	 s 	 	--	 on 	 ly 	 	three	 candid 	 ates 	 	remain	that	fit	the	bill	.
and	here	they	are	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	old	man	is	there	,	 a 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	famous	pen	 draw 	 ing 	 	of	the	homo	vitruvianus	.
and	 last 	 ly 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	portrait	of	a	male	that	leonardo	 paint 	 ed 	 	,	``	the	 music 	 ian 	 	.	``
before	we	go	 in 	 to 	 	these	 face 	 s 	 	,	i	should	explain	why	i	have	some	right	to	talk	about	them	.
i	've	made	more	than	1,100	 portrait 	 s 	 	 my 	 self 	 	for	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	over	the	course	of	300	--	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	sorry	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	.
but	there	are	1,100	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 artist 	 s 	 	have	drawn	so	 man 	 y 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
so	i	know	a	little	about	 draw 	 ing 	 	and	 analyz 	 ing 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	now	let	's	look	at	these	three	 portrait 	 s 	 	.
and	hold	onto	your	 seat 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	zoom	in	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	remark	how	they	have	the	same	broad	 fore 	 head 	 	,	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	,	the	long	nose	,	the	 curv 	 ed 	 	lips	and	the	small	,	well	-	 develop 	 ed 	 	chin	.
i	could	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	when	i	first	saw	that	.
there	is	no	reason	why	these	 portrait 	 s 	 	should	look	 a 	 like 	 	.
all	we	did	was	look	for	 portrait 	 s 	 	that	had	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	a	self	-	portrait	,	and	look	,	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	.
now	,	are	they	made	in	the	right	order	?
the	young	man	should	be	made	first	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	from	the	 year 	 s 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 create 	 d 	 	,	it	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	the	case	.
they	are	made	in	the	right	order	.
what	was	the	age	of	leonardo	at	the	time	?	 do 	 es 	 	that	fit	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	.	he	was	33	,	38	and	63	when	these	 we 	 re 	 	made	.
so	we	have	three	 picture 	 s 	 	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	of	the	same	person	of	the	same	age	 a 	 s 	 	leonardo	at	the	time	.
but	how	do	we	know	it	's	him	,	and	not	 some 	 one 	 	else	?
well	,	we	need	a	 re 	 ference 	 	.
and	here	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	picture	of	leonardo	that	's	 wide 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	a	statue	made	by	verrocchio	,	of	david	,	for	which	leonardo	posed	 a 	 s 	 	a	boy	of	15	.
and	if	we	now	 compar 	 e 	 	the	face	of	the	statue	,	with	the	face	of	the	 music 	 ian 	 	,	you	see	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	 feature 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	statue	is	the	 re 	 ference 	 	,	and	it	 connect 	 s 	 	the	 ident 	 ity 	 	of	leonardo	to	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 face 	 s 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	story	 ha 	 s 	 	not	yet	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	proper	that	you	here	at	ted	hear	and	see	it	first	.
the	icon	of	 icon 	 s 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	face	.
here	he	is	:	leonardo	da	vinci	.
