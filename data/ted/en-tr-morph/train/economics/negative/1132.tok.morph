so	security	is	two	different	 thing 	 s 	 	:	it	's	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	's	a	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	they	're	different	.
you	could	feel	secure	even	if	you	're	not	.
and	you	can	be	secure	even	if	you	do	n't	feel	it	.
 re 	 ally 	 	,	we	have	two	 separat 	 e 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	 ma 	 pped 	 	onto	the	same	word	.
and	what	i	want	to	do	in	 th 	 is 	 	talk	is	to	split	them	 a 	 part 	 	--	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	when	they	diverge	and	how	they	 converg 	 e 	 	.
and	language	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	problem	here	.
there	are	n't	a	lot	of	good	 word 	 s 	 	for	the	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	we	're	going	to	talk	about	.
so	if	you	look	at	security	from	economic	 term 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	trade	-	off	.
every	time	you	get	some	security	,	you	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	off	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	personal	decision	--	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	going	to	install	a	burglar	alarm	in	your	home	--	or	a	national	decision	--	where	you	're	going	to	 invad 	 e 	 	some	foreign	country	--	you	're	going	to	trade	off	 some 	 thing 	 	,	either	money	or	time	,	convenience	,	 cap 	 abilities 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	fundamental	 liber 	 ties 	 	.
and	the	question	to	ask	when	you	look	at	a	security	 any 	 thing 	 	is	not	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	 safe 	 r 	 	,	but	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	worth	the	trade	-	off	.
you	've	heard	in	the	past	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	world	is	 safe 	 r 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	saddam	hussein	is	not	in	power	.
that	might	be	true	,	but	it	's	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	relevant	.
the	question	is	,	was	it	worth	it	?
and	you	can	make	your	own	decision	,	and	then	you	'll	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	the	invasion	was	worth	it	.
that	's	how	you	think	about	security	--	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	trade	-	off	.
now	there	's	often	no	right	or	wrong	here	.
some	of	us	have	a	burglar	alarm	system	at	home	,	and	some	of	us	do	n't	.
and	it	'll	depend	on	where	we	live	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	live	 al 	 one 	 	or	have	a	family	,	how	much	cool	stuff	we	have	,	how	much	we	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	accept	the	risk	of	 t 	 heft 	 	.
in	 politic 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	there	are	different	 opinion 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	these	trade	-	offs	are	about	more	than	just	security	,	and	i	think	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
now	people	have	a	natural	 intuit 	 ion 	 	about	these	trade	-	offs	.
we	make	them	every	day	--	last	night	in	my	hotel	room	,	when	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	double	-	lock	the	door	,	or	you	in	your	car	when	you	drove	here	,	when	we	go	eat	lunch	and	decide	the	food	's	not	poison	and	we	'll	eat	it	.
we	make	these	trade	-	offs	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 multi 	 ple 	 	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.
we	often	wo	n't	even	notice	them	.
they	're	just	part	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	;	we	all	do	it	.
every	species	 do 	 es 	 	it	.
imagine	a	 rabbi 	 t 	 	in	a	field	,	eating	grass	,	and	the	 rabbi 	 t 	 	's	going	to	see	a	fox	.
that	 rabbi 	 t 	 	will	make	a	security	trade	-	off	:	``	should	i	stay	,	or	should	i	flee	?	``
and	if	you	think	about	it	,	the	 rabbi 	 ts 	 	that	are	good	at	making	that	trade	-	off	will	tend	to	live	and	 re 	 produce 	 	,	and	the	 rabbi 	 ts 	 	that	are	bad	at	it	will	get	eaten	or	 starv 	 e 	 	.
so	you	'd	think	that	us	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 success 	 ful 	 	species	on	the	planet	--	you	,	me	,	 every 	 body 	 	--	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	making	these	trade	-	offs	.
yet	it	 seem 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	we	're	 hope 	 lessly 	 	bad	at	it	.
and	i	think	that	's	a	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	.
i	'll	give	you	the	short	answer	.
the	answer	is	,	we	respond	to	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	security	and	not	the	 re 	 ality 	 	.
now	most	of	the	time	,	that	 work 	 s 	 	.
most	of	the	time	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 ality 	 	are	the	same	.
 certain 	 ly 	 	that	's	true	for	most	of	human	 pre 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ability	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	sense	.
one	way	to	think	of	it	is	that	we	're	 high 	 ly 	 	 optimize 	 d 	 	for	risk	 decision 	 s 	 	that	are	 en 	 demic 	 	to	living	in	small	family	 group 	 s 	 	in	the	east	african	 high 	 land 	 s 	 	in	100,000	b.c	.
2010	new	york	,	not	so	much	.
now	there	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 bias 	 es 	 	in	risk	 per 	 ception 	 	.
a	lot	of	good	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	you	can	see	certain	 bias 	 es 	 	that	come	up	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	i	'll	give	you	four	.
we	tend	to	 exagge 	 rate 	 	spectacular	and	rare	 risk 	 s 	 	and	 down 	 play 	 	common	 risk 	 s 	 	--	so	 fly 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	.
the	 un 	 known 	 	is	 perceive 	 d 	 	to	be	 risk 	 ier 	 	than	the	familiar	.
one	 ex 	 ample 	 	would	be	,	people	fear	 kidnap 	 ping 	 	by	 strange 	 rs 	 	when	the	data	 support 	 s 	 	 kidnap 	 ping 	 	by	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	is	much	more	common	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	for	children	.
third	,	 person 	 ified 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	are	 perceive 	 d 	 	to	be	 great 	 er 	 	than	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	--	so	bin	laden	is	 scar 	 ier 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	name	.
and	the	fourth	is	people	 under 	 estimate 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	in	 situ 	 ations 	 	they	do	control	and	 over 	 estimate 	 	them	in	 situ 	 ations 	 	they	do	n't	control	.
so	once	you	take	up	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	or	 smok 	 ing 	 	,	you	 down 	 play 	 	the	 risk 	 s 	 	.
if	a	risk	is	thrust	 up 	 on 	 	you	--	 terror 	 ism 	 	was	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	you	'll	 over 	 play 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	feel	like	it	's	in	your	control	.
there	are	a	bunch	of	other	of	these	 bias 	 es 	 	,	these	cognitive	 bias 	 es 	 	,	that	affect	our	risk	 decision 	 s 	 	.
there	's	the	 avail 	 ability 	 	heuristic	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	we	estimate	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	by	how	easy	it	is	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	of	it	to	mind	.
so	you	can	imagine	how	that	 work 	 s 	 	.
if	you	hear	a	lot	about	tiger	 attack 	 s 	 	,	there	must	be	a	lot	of	 tiger 	 s 	 	around	.
you	do	n't	hear	about	lion	 attack 	 s 	 	,	there	are	n't	a	lot	of	 lion 	 s 	 	around	.
 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	you	invent	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	do	is	they	repeat	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	rare	 risk 	 s 	 	.
i	tell	people	,	if	it	's	in	the	news	,	do	n't	worry	about	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	by	definition	,	news	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 al 	 most 	 	never	 happen 	 s 	 	.
when	 some 	 thing 	 	is	so	common	,	it	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	news	--	car	 crash 	 es 	 	,	domestic	violence	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 risk 	 s 	 	you	worry	about	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	a	species	of	 story 	 teller 	 s 	 	.
we	respond	to	 st 	 ories 	 	more	than	data	.
and	there	's	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	 in 	 nume 	 racy 	 	going	on	.
i	mean	,	the	joke	``	one	,	two	,	three	,	 man 	 y 	 	``	is	kind	of	right	.
we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	small	 number 	 s 	 	.
one	 man 	 go 	 	,	two	 man 	 go 	 es 	 	,	three	 man 	 go 	 es 	 	,	10,000	 man 	 go 	 es 	 	,	100,000	 man 	 go 	 es 	 	--	it	's	still	more	 man 	 go 	 es 	 	you	can	eat	before	they	rot	.
so	one	half	,	one	quarter	,	one	fifth	--	we	're	good	at	that	.
one	in	a	million	,	one	in	a	billion	--	they	're	both	 al 	 most 	 	never	.
so	we	have	trouble	with	the	 risk 	 s 	 	that	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	common	.
and	what	these	cognitive	 bias 	 es 	 	do	is	they	act	 a 	 s 	 	 filter 	 s 	 	between	us	and	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	the	result	is	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 ality 	 	get	out	of	whack	,	they	get	different	.
now	you	either	have	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	--	you	feel	more	secure	than	you	are	.
there	's	a	false	sense	of	security	.
or	the	other	way	,	and	that	's	a	false	sense	of	 in 	 security 	 	.
i	write	a	lot	about	``	security	theater	,	``	which	are	 product 	 s 	 	that	make	people	feel	secure	,	but	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
there	's	no	real	word	for	stuff	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	secure	,	but	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	us	feel	secure	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	what	the	cia	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	for	us	.
so	back	to	 economic 	 s 	 	.
if	 economic 	 s 	 	,	if	the	market	,	 drive 	 s 	 	security	,	and	if	people	make	trade	-	offs	based	on	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	security	,	then	the	smart	thing	for	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	do	for	the	economic	 incentive 	 s 	 	are	to	make	people	feel	secure	.
and	there	are	two	ways	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	,	you	can	make	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	secure	and	hope	they	notice	.
or	two	,	you	can	make	people	just	feel	secure	and	hope	they	do	n't	notice	.
so	what	 make 	 s 	 	people	notice	?
well	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	:	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	security	,	of	the	 risk 	 s 	 	,	the	 threat 	 s 	 	,	the	 counter 	 measure 	 s 	 	,	how	they	work	.
but	if	you	know	stuff	,	you	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	your	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	match	 re 	 ality 	 	.
 en 	 ough 	 	real	world	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	 help 	 s 	 	.
now	we	all	know	the	crime	rate	in	our	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	live	there	,	and	we	get	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	about	it	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	 match 	 es 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
security	theater	's	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	when	it	's	obvious	that	it	's	not	 work 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	what	 make 	 s 	 	people	not	notice	?
well	,	a	poor	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	do	n't	understand	the	 risk 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	understand	the	 cost 	 s 	 	,	you	're	 like 	 ly 	 	to	get	the	trade	-	off	wrong	,	and	your	 feel 	 ing 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	match	 re 	 ality 	 	.
not	 en 	 ough 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
there	's	an	inherent	problem	with	low	 prob 	 ability 	 	 event 	 s 	 	.
if	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 terror 	 ism 	 	 al 	 most 	 	never	 happen 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	 judg 	 e 	 	the	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	of	counter	-	terrorist	 measure 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	you	keep	 sacri 	 f 	 ic 	 ing 	 	 virgin 	 s 	 	,	and	why	your	 uni 	 corn 	 	 defense 	 s 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	just	great	.
there	are	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 failure 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	are	 cloud 	 ing 	 	the	 issue 	 s 	 	--	the	cognitive	 bias 	 es 	 	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	 fear 	 s 	 	,	folk	 belief 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	model	of	 re 	 ality 	 	.
so	let	me	 complic 	 ate 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	have	 feel 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 ality 	 	.
i	want	to	add	a	third	element	.	i	want	to	add	model	.
 feel 	 ing 	 	and	model	in	our	head	,	 re 	 ality 	 	is	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	change	;	it	's	real	.
so	 feel 	 ing 	 	is	based	on	our	 intuit 	 ion 	 	.
model	is	based	on	reason	.
that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
in	a	primitive	and	simple	world	,	there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	no	reason	for	a	model	 be 	 cause 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	is	close	to	 re 	 ality 	 	.
you	do	n't	need	a	model	.
but	in	a	modern	and	complex	world	,	you	need	 model 	 s 	 	to	understand	a	lot	of	the	 risk 	 s 	 	we	face	.
there	's	no	 feel 	 ing 	 	about	 germ 	 s 	 	.
you	need	a	model	to	understand	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	model	is	an	intelligent	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	.
it	's	,	of	course	,	 limit 	 ed 	 	by	science	,	by	technology	.
we	could	n't	have	a	germ	 theor 	 y 	 	of	disease	before	we	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	to	see	them	.
it	's	 limit 	 ed 	 	by	our	cognitive	 bias 	 es 	 	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	ability	to	 over 	 ride 	 	our	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
where	do	we	get	these	 model 	 s 	 	?	we	get	them	from	 other 	 s 	 	.
we	get	them	from	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	from	culture	,	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 elder 	 s 	 	.
a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	in	south	africa	on	safari	.
the	 track 	 er 	 	i	was	with	grew	up	in	kruger	national	park	.
he	had	some	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	 model 	 s 	 	of	how	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
and	it	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	by	a	lion	or	a	leopard	or	a	rhino	or	an	elephant	--	and	when	you	had	to	run	away	,	and	when	you	could	n't	run	away	,	and	when	you	had	to	climb	a	tree	--	when	you	could	never	climb	a	tree	.
i	would	have	 di 	 ed 	 	in	a	day	,	but	he	was	born	there	,	and	he	 under 	 stood 	 	how	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
i	was	born	in	new	york	city	.
i	could	have	taken	him	to	new	york	,	and	he	would	have	 di 	 ed 	 	in	a	day	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	different	 model 	 s 	 	based	on	our	different	 experience 	 s 	 	.
 model 	 s 	 	can	come	from	the	media	,	from	our	 elect 	 ed 	 	 official 	 s 	 	.
think	of	 model 	 s 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	child	 kidnap 	 ping 	 	,	 air 	 line 	 	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	car	 safe 	 ty 	 	.
 model 	 s 	 	can	come	from	industry	.
the	two	i	'm	 follow 	 ing 	 	are	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	,	id	 card 	 s 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	our	computer	security	 model 	 s 	 	come	from	there	.
a	lot	of	 model 	 s 	 	come	from	science	.
health	 model 	 s 	 	are	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
think	of	cancer	,	of	bird	flu	,	 s 	 wine 	 	flu	,	sars	.
all	of	our	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	security	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	come	from	 model 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	to	us	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	by	science	 filter 	 ed 	 	through	the	media	.
so	 model 	 s 	 	can	change	.
 model 	 s 	 	are	not	static	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	 be 	 come 	 	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	in	our	 environment 	 s 	 	,	our	model	can	move	 close 	 r 	 	to	our	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
so	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	might	be	,	if	you	go	back	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	 electric 	 ity 	 	was	first	 be 	 coming 	 	common	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	 fear 	 s 	 	about	it	.
i	mean	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	to	push	 door 	 bell 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	there	,	and	that	was	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
for	us	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 facil 	 e 	 	around	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
we	change	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	even	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
our	model	of	security	around	 electric 	 ity 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	born	 in 	 to 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	growing	up	.
and	we	're	good	at	it	.
or	think	of	the	 risk 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	--	how	your	 parent 	 s 	 	approach	 inter 	 net 	 	security	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	how	you	do	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	how	our	 kid 	 s 	 	will	.
 model 	 s 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 fad 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
intuitive	is	just	 an 	 other 	 	word	for	familiar	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	your	model	is	close	to	 re 	 ality 	 	,	and	it	 converg 	 es 	 	with	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	you	often	do	n't	know	it	's	there	.
so	a	nice	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	came	from	last	year	and	 s 	 wine 	 	flu	.
when	 s 	 wine 	 	flu	first	 appear 	 ed 	 	,	the	 initi 	 al 	 	news	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 over 	 re 	 action 	 	.
now	it	had	a	name	,	which	made	it	 scar 	 ier 	 	than	the	regular	flu	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	more	 dead 	 ly 	 	.
and	people	thought	 doctor 	 s 	 	should	be	able	to	deal	with	it	.
so	there	was	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	lack	of	control	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	made	the	risk	more	than	it	was	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	 novel 	 ty 	 	 wo 	 re 	 	off	,	the	 month 	 s 	 	went	by	,	there	was	some	amount	of	 toler 	 ance 	 	,	people	got	used	to	it	.
there	was	no	new	data	,	but	there	was	less	fear	.
by	 aut 	 umn 	 	,	people	thought	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	should	have	 solve 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
and	there	's	kind	of	a	 bifurc 	 ation 	 	--	people	had	to	 choos 	 e 	 	between	fear	and	 accept 	 ance 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	fear	and	 in 	 differ 	 ence 	 	--	they	kind	of	chose	 s 	 us 	 pic 	 ion 	 	.
and	when	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	last	winter	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	people	--	a	surprising	number	--	who	 re 	 fused 	 	to	get	it	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	nice	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	people	's	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	security	change	,	how	 the 	 ir 	 	model	 change 	 s 	 	,	sort	of	 wild 	 ly 	 	with	no	new	information	,	with	no	new	 in 	 put 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
i	'm	going	to	give	one	more	 complic 	 ation 	 	.
we	have	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	model	,	 re 	 ality 	 	.
i	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 relat 	 iv 	 istic 	 	view	of	security	.
i	think	it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	the	 observ 	 er 	 	.
and	most	security	 decision 	 s 	 	have	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	people	 involve 	 d 	 	.
and	 s 	 take 	 holder 	 s 	 	with	specific	trade	-	offs	will	try	to	influence	the	decision	.
and	i	call	that	 the 	 ir 	 	agenda	.
and	you	see	agenda	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 market 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 politic 	 s 	 	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	to	have	one	model	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 an 	 other 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	to	 ignor 	 e 	 	a	model	and	trust	your	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 marginal 	 izing 	 	people	with	 model 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 un 	 common 	 	.
an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	the	risk	of	 smok 	 ing 	 	.
in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	past	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	 smok 	 ing 	 	risk	 show 	 s 	 	how	a	model	 change 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 show 	 s 	 	how	an	industry	 fight 	 s 	 	against	a	model	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	like	.
 compar 	 e 	 	that	to	the	 second 	 hand 	 	smoke	debate	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	.
think	about	seat	 belt 	 s 	 	.
when	i	was	a	kid	,	no	one	 wo 	 re 	 	a	seat	belt	.
 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	no	kid	will	let	you	drive	if	you	're	not	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	seat	belt	.
 compar 	 e 	 	that	to	the	airbag	debate	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	30	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	.
all	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 model 	 s 	 	changing	.
what	we	learn	is	that	changing	 model 	 s 	 	is	hard	.
 model 	 s 	 	are	hard	to	 dis 	 lodge 	 	.
if	they	equal	your	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	even	know	you	have	a	model	.
and	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	cognitive	bias	i	'll	call	 confirm 	 ation 	 	bias	,	where	we	tend	to	accept	data	that	 confirm 	 s 	 	our	 belief 	 s 	 	and	reject	data	that	 contradict 	 s 	 	our	 belief 	 s 	 	.
so	evidence	against	our	model	,	we	're	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 ignor 	 e 	 	,	even	if	it	's	 compel 	 ling 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	get	 ver 	 y 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	before	we	'll	pay	attention	.
new	 model 	 s 	 	that	extend	long	 period 	 s 	 	of	time	are	hard	.
global	 warm 	 ing 	 	is	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
we	're	 terr 	 ible 	 	at	 model 	 s 	 	that	span	80	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	can	do	to	the	next	harvest	.
we	can	often	do	 un 	 til 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	grow	up	.
but	80	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	're	just	not	good	at	.
so	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	model	to	accept	.
we	can	have	both	 model 	 s 	 	in	our	head	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	right	,	that	kind	of	problem	where	we	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	both	 belief 	 s 	 	together	,	right	,	the	cognitive	dissonance	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	the	new	model	will	replace	the	old	model	.
strong	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	can	create	a	model	.
september	11th	 create 	 d 	 	a	security	model	in	a	lot	of	people	's	 head 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	personal	 experience 	 s 	 	with	crime	can	do	it	,	personal	health	 s 	 care 	 	,	a	health	 s 	 care 	 	in	the	news	.
you	'll	see	these	 call 	 ed 	 	 flash 	 bulb 	 	 event 	 s 	 	by	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	.
they	can	create	a	model	 instantaneous 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 e 	 motive 	 	.
so	in	the	 techno 	 logical 	 	world	,	we	do	n't	have	experience	to	 judg 	 e 	 	 model 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 other 	 s 	 	.	we	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 pro 	 xie 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	to	correct	 other 	 s 	 	.
we	 re 	 ly 	 	on	government	 age 	 ncies 	 	to	tell	us	what	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	are	safe	.
i	flew	here	 yester 	 day 	 	.
i	did	n't	check	the	 air 	 plane 	 	.
i	 reli 	 ed 	 	on	some	other	group	to	determine	 whet 	 her 	 	my	plane	was	safe	to	fly	.
we	're	here	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	fear	the	roof	is	going	to	collapse	on	us	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 check 	 ed 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	the	building	 code 	 s 	 	here	are	good	.
it	's	a	model	we	just	accept	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	by	faith	.
and	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
now	,	what	we	want	is	people	to	get	familiar	 en 	 ough 	 	with	better	 model 	 s 	 	--	have	it	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	to	allow	them	to	make	security	trade	-	offs	.
now	when	these	go	out	of	whack	,	you	have	two	 option 	 s 	 	.
one	,	you	can	fix	people	's	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 direct 	 ly 	 	appeal	to	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 manipul 	 ation 	 	,	but	it	can	work	.
the	second	,	more	honest	way	is	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	fix	the	model	.
change	 happen 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
the	 smok 	 ing 	 	debate	took	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	that	was	an	easy	one	.
some	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	hard	.
i	mean	 re 	 ally 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	information	 seem 	 s 	 	like	our	best	hope	.
and	i	 li 	 ed 	 	.
remember	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	model	,	 re 	 ality 	 	;	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	change	.	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
we	live	in	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	world	;	 re 	 ality 	 	 change 	 s 	 	all	the	time	.
so	we	might	have	--	for	the	first	time	in	our	species	--	 feel 	 ing 	 	 chase 	 s 	 	model	,	model	 chase 	 s 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	,	 re 	 ality 	 	's	moving	--	they	might	never	catch	up	.
we	do	n't	know	.
but	in	the	long	-	term	,	both	 feel 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 ality 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	i	want	to	close	with	two	quick	 st 	 ories 	 	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
1982	--	i	do	n't	know	if	people	will	remember	 th 	 is 	 	--	there	was	a	short	 epi 	 demic 	 	of	tylenol	 poison 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 horr 	 ific 	 	story	.	 some 	 one 	 	took	a	bottle	of	tylenol	,	put	poison	in	it	,	closed	it	up	,	put	it	back	on	the	shelf	.
 some 	 one 	 	else	 b 	 ought 	 	it	and	 di 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ified 	 	people	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	a	couple	of	 copy 	 cat 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	.
there	was	n't	any	real	risk	,	but	people	 we 	 re 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	tamper	-	proof	drug	industry	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	tamper	-	proof	 cap 	 s 	 	,	that	came	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	complete	security	theater	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	 home 	 work 	 	 assign 	 ment 	 	,	think	of	10	ways	to	get	around	it	.
i	'll	give	you	one	,	a	syringe	.
but	it	made	people	feel	better	.
it	made	 the 	 ir 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	security	more	match	the	 re 	 ality 	 	.
last	story	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	friend	of	mine	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	.
i	visit	her	in	the	hospital	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	when	a	baby	's	born	now	,	they	put	an	rfid	 brace 	 let 	 	on	the	baby	,	put	a	 correspond 	 ing 	 	one	on	the	mother	,	so	if	 any 	 one 	 	other	than	the	mother	 take 	 s 	 	the	baby	out	of	the	 mat 	 ern 	 ity 	 	ward	,	an	alarm	 go 	 es 	 	off	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	that	's	kind	of	neat	.
i	wonder	how	 ramp 	 ant 	 	baby	 snatch 	 ing 	 	is	out	of	 hospital 	 s 	 	.	``
i	go	home	,	i	look	it	up	.
it	 bas 	 ically 	 	never	 happen 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	think	about	it	,	if	you	are	a	hospital	,	and	you	need	to	take	a	baby	away	from	 it 	 s 	 	mother	,	out	of	the	room	to	run	some	 test 	 s 	 	,	you	better	have	some	good	security	theater	,	or	she	's	going	to	rip	your	arm	off	.
so	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	design	security	,	who	look	at	security	policy	,	or	even	look	at	public	policy	in	ways	that	affect	security	.
it	's	not	just	 re 	 ality 	 	;	it	's	 feel 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 ality 	 	.
what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	they	be	about	the	same	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	,	if	our	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	match	 re 	 ality 	 	,	we	make	better	security	trade	-	offs	.
thank	you	.
