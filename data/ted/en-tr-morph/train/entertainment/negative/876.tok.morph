we	live	in	difficult	and	 challeng 	 ing 	 	economic	 time 	 s 	 	,	of	course	.
and	one	of	the	first	 victim 	 s 	 	of	difficult	economic	 time 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	is	public	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	of	any	kind	,	but	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	the	 fir 	 ing 	 	line	at	the	moment	is	public	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	for	science	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	curiosity	-	led	science	and	exploration	.
so	i	want	to	try	and	 con 	 vince 	 	you	in	about	15	 minute 	 s 	 	that	that	's	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	and	 ludicr 	 ous 	 	thing	to	do	.
but	i	think	to	set	the	scene	,	i	want	to	show	--	the	next	slide	is	not	my	attempt	to	show	the	worst	ted	slide	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	ted	,	but	it	is	a	bit	of	a	mess	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	not	my	fault	;	it	's	from	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	.
and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	how	much	science	 cost 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	i	'm	going	to	make	the	case	for	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	on	curiosity	-	driven	science	and	exploration	,	i	should	tell	you	how	much	it	 cost 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	game	 call 	 ed 	 	``	spot	the	science	 budget 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	u.k.	government	 s 	 pend 	 	.
you	see	there	,	it	's	about	620	billion	a	year	.
the	science	budget	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	if	you	look	to	your	left	,	there	's	a	 pur 	 ple 	 	set	of	 blob 	 s 	 	and	then	yellow	set	of	 blob 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	one	of	the	yellow	set	of	 blob 	 s 	 	around	the	big	yellow	blob	.
it	's	about	3.3	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	per	year	out	of	620	billion	.
that	 fund 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	u.k	.
from	medical	research	,	space	exploration	,	where	i	work	,	at	cern	in	geneva	,	particle	physics	,	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	even	 art 	 s 	 	and	 human 	 ities 	 	,	funded	from	the	science	budget	,	which	is	that	3.3	billion	,	that	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	yellow	blob	around	the	 o 	 range 	 	blob	at	the	top	left	of	the	screen	.
so	that	's	what	we	're	 argu 	 ing 	 	about	.
that	 percent 	 age 	 	,	by	the	way	,	is	about	the	same	in	the	u.s.	and	germany	and	france	.
r	&	d	in	total	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	 public 	 ly 	 	funded	,	is	about	0.6	percent	of	gdp	.
so	that	's	what	we	're	 argu 	 ing 	 	about	.
the	first	thing	i	want	to	say	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	straight	from	``	 wonder 	 s 	 	of	the	solar	system	,	``	is	that	our	exploration	of	the	solar	system	and	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	us	that	it	is	 indescrib 	 ably 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	 s 	 ent 	 	back	by	the	cassini	space	 prob 	 e 	 	around	saturn	,	after	we	'd	 finish 	 ed 	 	 film 	 ing 	 	``	 wonder 	 s 	 	of	the	solar	system	.	``
so	it	is	n't	in	the	 s 	 eries 	 	.
it	's	of	the	moon	enceladus	.
so	that	big	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	,	white	sphere	in	the	corner	is	saturn	,	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	of	the	picture	.
and	that	 cr 	 escent 	 	there	is	the	moon	enceladus	,	which	is	about	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	the	british	isles	.
it	's	about	500	 kilometer 	 s 	 	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	.
so	,	 tin 	 y 	 	moon	.
what	's	 fasci 	 nating 	 	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	...
 th 	 is 	 	an	 un 	 process 	 ed 	 	picture	,	by	the	way	,	i	should	say	,	it	's	black	and	white	,	straight	from	saturnian	orbit	.
what	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	is	,	you	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	see	on	the	limb	there	some	faint	,	sort	of	,	 wis 	 ps 	 	of	 al 	 most 	 	smoke	 ris 	 ing 	 	up	from	the	limb	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	 visual 	 ize 	 	that	in	``	 wonder 	 s 	 	of	the	solar	system	.	``
it	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	graphic	.
what	we	found	out	 we 	 re 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	faint	 wis 	 ps 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fountain 	 s 	 	of	ice	 ris 	 ing 	 	up	from	the	surface	of	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	moon	.
that	's	 fasci 	 nating 	 	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	in	 it 	 self 	 	,	but	we	think	that	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 	for	 power 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 fountain 	 s 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	there	to	be	 lake 	 s 	 	of	liquid	water	 be 	 neath 	 	the	surface	of	 th 	 is 	 	moon	.
and	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	about	that	is	that	,	on	our	planet	,	on	earth	,	 where 	 ver 	 	we	find	liquid	water	,	we	find	life	.
so	,	to	find	strong	evidence	of	liquid	,	 pool 	 s 	 	of	liquid	,	 be 	 neath 	 	the	surface	of	a	moon	750	million	 mile 	 s 	 	away	from	the	earth	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 astound 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	is	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	a	 habit 	 at 	 	for	life	in	the	solar	system	.
well	,	let	me	just	say	,	that	was	a	graphic	.	i	just	want	to	show	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
that	's	one	more	picture	of	enceladus	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	when	cassini	flew	 be 	 neath 	 	enceladus	.
so	it	made	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	pass	,	just	a	few	hundred	 kilometer 	 s 	 	above	the	surface	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	real	picture	of	the	ice	 fountain 	 s 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	space	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
but	that	's	not	the	prime	 candid 	 ate 	 	for	life	in	the	solar	system	.
that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	which	is	a	moon	of	jupiter	,	europa	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	had	to	fly	to	the	jovian	system	to	get	any	sense	that	 th 	 is 	 	moon	,	 a 	 s 	 	most	 moon 	 s 	 	,	was	 any 	 thing 	 	other	than	a	dead	ball	of	rock	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	ice	moon	.
so	what	you	're	looking	at	is	the	surface	of	the	moon	europa	,	which	is	a	thick	sheet	of	ice	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	hundred	 kilometer 	 s 	 	thick	.
but	by	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	way	that	europa	 interact 	 s 	 	with	the	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	of	jupiter	,	and	looking	at	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 crack 	 s 	 	in	the	ice	that	you	can	see	there	on	that	graphic	move	around	,	we	've	 infer 	 red 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	that	there	's	an	ocean	of	liquid	 surround 	 ing 	 	the	entire	surface	of	europa	.
so	 be 	 low 	 	the	ice	,	there	's	an	ocean	of	liquid	around	the	whole	moon	.
it	could	be	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 kilometer 	 s 	 	deep	,	we	think	.
we	think	it	's	 salt 	 water 	 	,	and	that	would	mean	that	there	's	more	water	on	that	moon	of	jupiter	than	there	is	in	all	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	 combine 	 d 	 	.
so	that	place	,	a	little	moon	around	jupiter	,	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	prime	 candid 	 ate 	 	for	 find 	 ing 	 	life	on	a	moon	or	a	body	 out 	 side 	 	the	earth	,	that	we	know	of	.
tremendous	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	.
our	exploration	of	the	solar	system	 ha 	 s 	 	taught	us	that	the	solar	system	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
it	may	 al 	 so 	 	have	 point 	 ed 	 	the	way	to	 answer 	 ing 	 	one	of	the	most	 pro 	 found 	 	 question 	 s 	 	that	you	can	possibly	ask	,	which	is	:	``	are	we	 al 	 one 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	?	``
is	there	any	other	use	to	exploration	and	science	,	other	than	just	a	sense	of	wonder	?
well	,	there	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	picture	taken	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	on	my	first	christmas	eve	,	december	24th	,	1968	,	when	i	was	about	eight	 month 	 s 	 	old	.
it	was	taken	by	apollo	8	 a 	 s 	 	it	went	around	the	back	of	the	moon	.
earthrise	from	apollo	8	.
a	famous	picture	;	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 s 	 aid 	 	that	it	's	the	picture	that	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	1968	,	which	was	a	 turbul 	 ent 	 	year	--	the	student	 riot 	 s 	 	in	paris	,	the	height	of	the	vietnam	war	.
the	reason	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	that	about	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	and	al	gore	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	it	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	on	the	stage	at	ted	,	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	 argu 	 ably 	 	,	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	for	the	first	time	,	we	saw	our	world	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	solid	,	 im 	 movable 	 	,	kind	of	 in 	 destruct 	 ible 	 	place	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	fragile	-	looking	world	just	 hang 	 ing 	 	against	the	 black 	 ness 	 	of	space	.
what	's	 al 	 so 	 	not	often	 s 	 aid 	 	about	the	space	exploration	,	about	the	apollo	program	,	is	the	economic	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	it	made	.
i	mean	while	you	can	make	 argument 	 s 	 	that	it	was	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	a	tremendous	 achiev 	 ement 	 	and	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	cost	a	lot	,	did	n't	it	?
well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	about	the	economic	 effective 	 ness 	 	,	the	economic	impact	of	apollo	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	one	was	in	1975	by	chase	econometrics	.
and	it	 show 	 ed 	 	that	for	every	$	1	 s 	 pent 	 	on	apollo	,	14	came	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
so	the	apollo	program	paid	for	 it 	 self 	 	in	inspiration	,	in	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	 achiev 	 ement 	 	and	,	i	think	,	in	inspiring	young	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	14	 time 	 s 	 	over	.
so	exploration	can	pay	for	 it 	 self 	 	.
what	about	scientific	 discover 	 y 	 	?
what	about	 driv 	 ing 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	picture	of	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
what	it	is	,	is	a	picture	of	the	spectrum	of	hydrogen	.
see	,	back	in	the	1880s	,	1890s	,	 man 	 y 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 observ 	 ers 	 	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	light	 give 	 n 	 	off	from	 atom 	 s 	 	.
and	they	saw	strange	 picture 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	when	you	put	it	through	a	prism	is	that	you	heat	hydrogen	up	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	glow	like	a	white	light	,	it	just	 emit 	 s 	 	light	at	 part 	 icular 	 	 color 	 s 	 	,	a	red	one	,	a	light	blue	one	,	some	dark	blue	 one 	 s 	 	.
now	that	led	to	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	atomic	structure	 be 	 cause 	 	the	way	that	's	 explain 	 ed 	 	is	 atom 	 s 	 	are	a	single	nucleus	with	 electron 	 s 	 	going	around	them	.
and	the	 electron 	 s 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	when	they	jump	up	to	the	next	place	they	can	be	,	and	fall	back	down	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	emit	light	at	 part 	 icular 	 	 color 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	fact	that	 atom 	 s 	 	,	when	you	heat	them	up	,	 on 	 ly 	 	emit	light	at	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 color 	 s 	 	,	was	one	of	the	key	 driver 	 s 	 	that	led	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	the	 quant 	 um 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	,	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	the	structure	of	 atom 	 s 	 	.
i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 remark 	 able 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	picture	of	the	spectrum	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	 atom 	 s 	 	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	atmosphere	 absorb 	 ing 	 	light	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	 on 	 ly 	 	absorb	light	at	 part 	 icular 	 	 color 	 s 	 	when	 electron 	 s 	 	jump	up	and	fall	down	,	jump	up	and	fall	down	.
but	look	at	the	number	of	black	lines	in	that	spectrum	.
and	the	element	 hel 	 ium 	 	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	just	by	 star 	 ing 	 	at	the	light	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	black	lines	 we 	 re 	 	found	that	 correspond 	 ed 	 	to	no	known	element	.
and	that	's	why	 hel 	 ium 	 	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 hel 	 io 	 s 	 	``	--	 hel 	 io 	 s 	 	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
now	,	that	 sound 	 s 	 	esoteric	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	it	was	an	esoteric	 pur 	 suit 	 	,	but	the	 quant 	 um 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	led	to	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 behavior 	 s 	 	of	 electron 	 s 	 	in	 material 	 s 	 	like	silicon	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
the	way	that	silicon	 behav 	 es 	 	,	the	fact	that	you	can	build	 transistor 	 s 	 	,	is	a	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
so	 with 	 out 	 	that	curiosity	-	driven	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	structure	of	 atom 	 s 	 	,	which	led	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	esoteric	 theor 	 y 	 	,	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	then	we	would	n't	have	 transistor 	 s 	 	,	we	would	n't	have	silicon	 chip 	 s 	 	,	we	would	n't	have	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	our	modern	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
there	's	one	more	,	i	think	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	twist	to	that	tale	.
in	``	 wonder 	 s 	 	of	the	solar	system	,	``	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	 emphas 	 izing 	 	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	are	universal	.
it	's	one	of	the	most	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	physics	and	the	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	nature	that	you	get	on	earth	,	is	you	can	transport	it	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	the	 planet 	 s 	 	,	but	to	the	most	 di 	 stant 	 	 star 	 s 	 	and	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	just	by	looking	at	the	structure	of	 atom 	 s 	 	--	the	same	 theor 	 y 	 	that	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	 transistor 	 s 	 	--	is	that	there	can	be	no	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	have	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	end	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	that	are	 big 	 ger 	 	than	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	1.4	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
that	's	a	limit	 impose 	 d 	 	on	the	mass	of	 star 	 s 	 	.
you	can	work	it	out	on	a	piece	of	paper	in	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	get	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	 s 	 wing 	 	it	to	the	sky	,	and	you	find	that	there	are	no	dead	 star 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	1.4	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 predict 	 ion 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	have	a	star	that	's	right	on	the	edge	of	that	mass	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	picture	of	a	 galax 	 y 	 	,	a	common	``	our	garden	``	 galax 	 y 	 	with	,	what	,	100	billion	 star 	 s 	 	like	our	 s 	 un 	 	in	it	.
it	's	just	one	of	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
there	are	a	billion	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	galactic	core	,	which	is	why	it	's	 shin 	 ing 	 	out	so	 bright 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	50	million	light	 year 	 s 	 	away	,	so	one	of	our	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
but	that	bright	star	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
so	that	star	is	 al 	 so 	 	50	million	light	 year 	 s 	 	away	.
it	's	part	of	that	 galax 	 y 	 	,	and	it	's	 shin 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bright 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	with	a	billion	 s 	 un 	 s 	 	in	it	.
that	's	a	type	ia	supernova	explosion	.
now	that	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	star	that	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	there	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	carbon	-	oxygen	dwarf	.
it	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	there	about	,	say	,	1.3	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 bin 	 ary 	 	companion	that	 go 	 es 	 	around	it	,	so	a	big	star	,	a	big	ball	of	gas	.
and	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 suck 	 s 	 	gas	off	 it 	 s 	 	companion	star	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	limit	 call 	 ed 	 	the	chandrasekhar	limit	,	and	then	it	 explode 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 explode 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 shine 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bright 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	billion	 s 	 un 	 s 	 	for	about	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	energy	,	but	a	huge	amount	of	chemical	 element 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
in	fact	,	that	one	is	a	carbon	-	oxygen	dwarf	.
now	,	there	was	no	carbon	and	oxygen	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	at	the	big	bang	.
and	there	was	no	carbon	and	oxygen	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	first	generation	of	 star 	 s 	 	.
it	was	made	in	 star 	 s 	 	like	that	,	 lock 	 ed 	 	away	and	then	 return 	 ed 	 	to	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	in	 explosion 	 s 	 	like	that	in	order	to	 re 	 condens 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	 star 	 s 	 	,	new	solar	 system 	 s 	 	and	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	people	like	us	.
i	think	that	's	a	 remark 	 able 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	the	power	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	 universal 	 ity 	 	of	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	understand	that	process	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	understand	the	structure	of	 atom 	 s 	 	here	on	earth	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	quote	that	i	found	--	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 s 	 er 	 en 	 dip 	 ity 	 	there	--	from	alexander	fleming	:	``	when	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	just	after	dawn	on	september	28	,	1928	,	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	n't	plan	to	 revolution 	 ize 	 	all	medicine	by	 discover 	 ing 	 	the	world	's	first	 anti 	 biotic 	 	.	``
now	,	the	 explore 	 rs 	 	of	the	world	of	the	atom	did	not	intend	to	invent	the	transistor	.
and	they	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	n't	intend	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	of	supernova	 explosion 	 s 	 	,	which	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	told	us	where	the	building	 block 	 s 	 	of	life	 we 	 re 	 	 synthesize 	 d 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	,	i	think	science	can	be	--	 s 	 er 	 en 	 dip 	 ity 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	can	be	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.	it	can	reveal	 quit 	 e 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	can	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	think	,	 final 	 ly 	 	reveal	the	most	 pro 	 found 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	to	us	about	our	place	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	the	value	of	our	home	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	spectacular	picture	of	our	home	planet	.
now	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	our	home	planet	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	saturn	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	it	is	.
it	was	taken	by	the	cassini	space	 prob 	 e 	 	.
but	it	's	a	famous	picture	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	 majes 	 ty 	 	of	saturn	's	 ring 	 s 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	 tin 	 y 	 	,	faint	blob	just	 hang 	 ing 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	one	of	the	 ring 	 s 	 	.
and	if	i	blow	it	up	there	,	you	see	it	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	moon	,	but	in	fact	,	it	's	a	picture	of	earth	.
it	was	a	picture	of	earth	 capture 	 d 	 	in	that	frame	of	saturn	.
that	's	our	planet	from	750	million	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
i	think	the	earth	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	strange	 proper 	 ty 	 	that	the	 far 	 ther 	 	away	you	get	from	it	,	the	more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	it	 seem 	 s 	 	.
but	that	is	not	the	most	 di 	 stant 	 	or	most	famous	picture	of	our	planet	.
it	was	taken	by	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	voyager	 space 	 craft 	 	.
and	that	's	a	picture	of	me	in	front	of	it	for	scale	.
the	voyager	is	a	 tin 	 y 	 	machine	.
it	's	 current 	 ly 	 	10	billion	 mile 	 s 	 	away	from	earth	,	 transmit 	 ting 	 	with	that	dish	,	with	the	power	of	20	 watt 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	still	in	contact	with	it	.
but	it	 visit 	 ed 	 	jupiter	,	saturn	,	uranus	and	neptune	.
and	after	it	 visit 	 ed 	 	all	four	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	carl	sagan	,	who	's	one	of	my	great	heroes	,	had	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	idea	of	 turn 	 ing 	 	voyager	around	and	taking	a	picture	of	every	planet	it	had	 visit 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	took	 th 	 is 	 	picture	of	earth	.
now	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	see	the	earth	there	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	pale	blue	dot	``	picture	,	but	earth	is	 suspend 	 ed 	 	in	that	red	shaft	of	light	.
that	's	earth	from	four	billion	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
and	i	'd	like	to	read	you	what	sagan	wrote	about	it	,	just	to	finish	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	can	not	say	 word 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	he	saw	in	that	picture	that	he	had	taken	.
