hi	,	my	name	is	frank	,	and	i	collect	 secret 	 s 	 	.
it	all	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	crazy	idea	in	november	of	2004	.
i	 print 	 ed 	 	up	3,000	self	-	 address 	 ed 	 	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	,	just	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	blank	on	one	side	,	and	on	the	other	side	i	 list 	 ed 	 	some	simple	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	 anonym 	 ously 	 	share	an	 art 	 ful 	 	secret	they	'd	never	told	 any 	 one 	 	before	.
and	i	 hand 	 ed 	 	out	these	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	 random 	 ly 	 	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	washington	,	d.c.	,	not	 know 	 ing 	 	what	to	expect	.
but	soon	the	idea	 beg 	 an 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	 viral 	 ly 	 	.
people	 beg 	 an 	 	to	buy	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	and	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 receiv 	 ing 	 	 secret 	 s 	 	in	my	home	 mail 	 box 	 	,	not	just	with	 post 	 mark 	 s 	 	from	washington	,	d.c.	,	but	from	texas	,	california	,	vancouver	,	new	zealand	,	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
