 hell 	 o 	 	,	my	name	is	thomas	heatherwick	.
i	have	a	studio	in	london	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	approach	to	 design 	 ing 	 	 building 	 s 	 	.
when	i	was	growing	up	,	i	was	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	making	and	 craft 	 s 	 	and	 material 	 s 	 	and	 invent 	 ion 	 	on	a	small	scale	.
and	i	was	there	looking	at	the	 large 	 r 	 	scale	of	 building 	 s 	 	and	 find 	 ing 	 	that	the	 building 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	around	me	and	that	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	designed	and	that	 we 	 re 	 	there	in	the	 public 	 ations 	 	i	was	 see 	 ing 	 	felt	 soul 	 less 	 	and	cold	.
and	there	on	the	 small 	 er 	 	scale	,	the	scale	of	an	 ear 	 ring 	 	or	a	ceramic	pot	or	a	musical	instrument	,	was	a	 material 	 ity 	 	and	a	 soul 	 fulness 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	me	.
the	first	building	i	built	was	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	since	,	in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	studio	in	london	.
sorry	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	my	mother	,	by	the	way	,	in	her	 be 	 ad 	 	shop	in	london	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	 count 	 ing 	 	 be 	 ad 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
i	'm	just	going	to	show	,	for	people	who	do	n't	know	my	studio	's	work	,	a	few	 project 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 work 	 ed 	 	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	hospital	building	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	shop	for	a	bag	company	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 studio 	 s 	 	for	 artist 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	made	from	a	million	 yard 	 s 	 	of	wire	and	150,000	glass	 be 	 ad 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	golf	ball	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	window	 dis 	 play 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	pair	of	 cool 	 ing 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	for	an	 electric 	 ity 	 	 sub 	 station 	 	next	to	st.	paul	's	 cat 	 hedral 	 	in	london	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	temple	in	japan	for	a	buddhist	monk	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cafe	by	the	sea	in	britain	.
and	just	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	is	we	 we 	 re 	 	 commission 	 ed 	 	by	the	mayor	of	london	to	design	a	new	bus	that	 g 	 ave 	 	the	passenger	 the 	 ir 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	original	routemaster	bus	that	some	of	you	may	be	familiar	with	,	which	had	 th 	 is 	 	open	platform	at	the	back	--	in	fact	,	i	think	all	our	routemasters	are	here	in	california	now	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
but	they	are	n't	in	london	.
and	so	you	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	on	a	bus	.
and	if	the	bus	is	going	to	stop	and	it	's	three	 yard 	 s 	 	away	from	the	bus	stop	,	you	're	just	a	prisoner	.
but	the	mayor	of	london	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 introduc 	 e 	 	 bus 	 es 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	open	platform	.
so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	transport	for	london	,	and	that	 organ 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	client	for	a	new	bus	for	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	have	a	chance	to	work	.
the	brief	is	that	the	bus	should	use	40	percent	less	energy	.
so	it	's	got	hybrid	drive	.
and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	try	to	improve	 every 	 thing 	 	from	the	fabric	to	the	format	and	structure	and	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	.
i	was	going	to	show	four	main	 project 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	for	a	bridge	.
and	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 commission 	 ed 	 	to	design	a	bridge	that	would	open	.
and	 open 	 ing 	 s 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	--	 every 	 one 	 	 love 	 s 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	 bridge 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	thing	.
i	think	we	all	kind	of	stand	and	watch	.
but	the	 bridge 	 s 	 	that	we	saw	that	 open 	 ed 	 	and	closed	--	i	'm	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 squeam 	 ish 	 	--	but	i	once	saw	a	photograph	of	a	 foot 	 ball 	 er 	 	who	was	 div 	 ing 	 	for	a	ball	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	he	was	 div 	 ing 	 	,	 some 	 one 	 	had	 s 	 tamped 	 	on	his	knee	,	and	it	had	broken	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	then	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 bridge 	 s 	 	and	just	could	n't	help	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	it	was	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	that	had	broken	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	paddington	in	london	.
and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	bridge	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	.
it	's	just	steel	and	timber	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	of	what	it	is	,	our	focus	was	on	the	way	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.
so	we	 like 	 d 	 	the	idea	that	the	two	 far 	 th 	 est 	 	bits	of	it	would	end	up	 kiss 	 ing 	 	each	other	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	to	 halv 	 e 	 	 it 	 s 	 	speed	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	was	too	 scar 	 ed 	 	when	we	first	did	it	.
so	that	's	it	 speed 	 ed 	 	up	.
a	project	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	is	to	design	a	new	 bio 	 mass 	 	power	station	--	so	a	power	station	that	uses	 organ 	 ic 	 	waste	material	.
in	the	news	,	the	subject	of	where	our	future	water	is	going	to	come	from	and	where	our	power	is	going	to	come	from	is	in	all	the	 paper 	 s 	 	all	the	time	.
and	we	used	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	proud	of	the	way	we	generated	power	.
but	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	any	annual	report	of	a	power	company	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	power	station	on	it	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	child	running	through	a	field	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
and	so	when	a	 con 	 sort 	 ium 	 	of	 engineer 	 s 	 	 approach 	 ed 	 	us	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	work	with	them	on	 th 	 is 	 	power	station	,	our	condition	was	that	we	would	work	with	them	and	that	,	 what 	 ever 	 	we	did	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	not	just	going	to	 decor 	 ate 	 	a	normal	power	station	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	had	to	learn	--	we	kind	of	 force 	 d 	 	them	to	teach	us	.
and	so	we	 s 	 pent 	 	time	 travel 	 ing 	 	with	them	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	all	the	different	 element 	 s 	 	,	and	 find 	 ing 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 in 	 efficiencies 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 be 	 ing 	 	 capital 	 ized 	 	on	.
that	just	taking	a	field	and	 bang 	 ing 	 	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	out	is	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	the	most	efficient	way	that	they	could	work	.
so	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	how	we	could	compose	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 element 	 s 	 	--	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	litter	,	create	one	 com 	 position 	 	.
and	what	we	found	--	 th 	 is 	 	area	is	one	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	britain	.
it	was	 vot 	 ed 	 	the	worst	place	in	britain	to	live	.
and	there	are	2,000	new	 home 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	built	next	to	 th 	 is 	 	power	station	.
so	it	felt	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	social	dimension	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 symbol 	 ic 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	.
and	we	should	be	proud	of	where	our	power	is	coming	from	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 some 	 thing 	 	we	are	 necess 	 arily 	 	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	of	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	how	we	could	make	a	power	station	,	that	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	people	out	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	big	 f 	 ence 	 	around	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	could	be	a	place	that	 pull 	 s 	 	you	in	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	--	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	my	--	250	feet	high	.
so	it	felt	that	what	we	could	try	to	do	is	make	a	power	park	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	the	whole	area	in	,	and	using	the	spare	 s 	 oil 	 	that	's	there	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	we	could	make	a	power	station	that	was	silent	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 be 	 cause 	 	just	that	 s 	 oil 	 	could	make	the	acoustic	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	found	that	we	could	make	a	more	efficient	structure	and	have	a	cost	-	effective	way	of	making	a	structure	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	 finish 	 ed 	 	project	is	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	more	than	just	a	power	station	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	space	where	you	could	have	a	bar	mitzvah	at	the	top	.
and	it	's	a	power	park	.
so	people	can	come	and	 re 	 ally 	 	experience	 th 	 is 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	look	out	all	around	the	area	,	and	use	that	height	that	we	have	to	have	for	 it 	 s 	 	function	.
in	shanghai	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	build	--	well	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 invit 	 ed 	 	;	what	am	i	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
we	won	the	 com 	 petition 	 	,	and	it	was	 pain 	 ful 	 	to	get	there	.
so	we	won	the	 com 	 petition 	 	to	build	the	u.k.	pavilion	.
and	an	expo	is	a	 total 	 ly 	 	 bon 	 ker 	 s 	 	thing	.
there	's	250	 pavilion 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	world	's	 big 	 gest 	 	ever	expo	that	had	ever	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
so	there	are	up	to	a	million	people	there	 every 	 day 	 	.
and	250	 count 	 ries 	 	all	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	british	government	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	you	need	to	be	in	the	top	five	.	``
and	so	that	 be 	 came 	 	the	 government 	 al 	 	goal	--	is	,	how	do	you	stand	out	in	 th 	 is 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	,	which	is	an	expo	of	 stimul 	 us 	 	?
so	our	sense	was	we	had	to	do	one	thing	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	one	thing	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	have	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	so	what	we	 al 	 so 	 	felt	was	that	 what 	 ever 	 	we	did	we	could	n't	do	a	 che 	 es 	 y 	 	advert	for	britain	.
but	the	thing	that	was	true	,	the	expo	was	about	the	future	of	cities	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	victorians	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	 integ 	 rating 	 	nature	 in 	 to 	 	the	cities	.
and	the	world	's	first	public	park	of	modern	 time 	 s 	 	was	in	britain	.
and	the	world	's	first	major	 botanic 	 al 	 	institution	is	in	london	,	and	they	have	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	project	where	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	25	percent	of	all	the	world	's	plant	species	.
so	we	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	that	 tree 	 s 	 	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	and	i	've	never	met	 any 	 one 	 	who	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	like	 tree 	 s 	 	.	``
and	the	same	with	 flower 	 s 	 	.
i	've	never	met	 any 	 one 	 	who	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	like	 flower 	 s 	 	.	``
but	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 seed 	 s 	 	--	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	project	 happen 	 ing 	 	--	but	that	 seed 	 s 	 	--	at	these	major	 botanic 	 al 	 	 garden 	 s 	 	,	 seed 	 s 	 	are	n't	on	show	.
but	you	just	have	to	go	to	a	garden	center	,	and	they	're	in	little	paper	 pack 	 et 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 al 	 	project	's	 be 	 en 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	 real 	 ized 	 	we	had	to	make	a	project	that	would	be	 seed 	 s 	 	,	some	kind	of	seed	 cat 	 hedral 	 	.
but	how	could	we	show	these	 teen 	 y 	 	-	weeny	 thing 	 s 	 	?
and	the	film	``	jurassic	park	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	dna	of	the	dinosaur	that	was	trapped	in	the	 am 	 ber 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	us	some	kind	of	clue	that	these	 tin 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	could	be	trapped	and	be	made	to	seem	precious	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	looking	like	nuts	.
so	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	,	how	are	we	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	light	and	 ex 	 pose 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	?
we	did	n't	want	to	make	a	 separat 	 e 	 	building	and	have	 separat 	 e 	 	content	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	think	,	how	could	we	make	a	whole	thing	emanate	.
by	the	way	,	we	had	half	the	budget	of	the	other	western	 nation 	 s 	 	.
so	that	was	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	mix	with	the	 s 	 ite 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	pitch	.
and	so	there	was	one	 part 	 icular 	 	 to 	 y 	 	that	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	clue	.
voice	over	:	the	new	play	-	doh	mop	top	hair	shop	.
song	:	♫	we	've	got	the	mop	 top 	 s 	 	,	the	play	-	doh	mop	 top 	 s 	 	♫	♫	just	turn	the	chair	and	grow	play	-	doh	hair	♫	♫	they	're	the	mop	 top 	 s 	 	♫	thomas	heatherwick	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	you	get	the	idea	.
so	the	idea	was	to	take	these	66,000	 seed 	 s 	 	that	they	 agree 	 d 	 	to	give	us	,	and	to	take	each	seed	and	trap	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	precious	optical	hair	and	grow	that	through	 th 	 is 	 	box	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	box	element	,	and	make	it	a	building	that	could	move	in	the	wind	.
so	the	whole	thing	can	 gent 	 ly 	 	move	when	the	wind	 blow 	 s 	 	.
and	 in 	 side 	 	,	the	 day 	 light 	 	--	each	one	is	an	optic	and	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	light	 in 	 to 	 	the	center	.
and	by	night	,	artificial	light	in	each	one	 emanate 	 s 	 	and	 come 	 s 	 	out	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	to	make	the	project	 afford 	 able 	 	,	we	focused	our	energy	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	building	a	building	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	the	 foot 	 ball 	 	pitch	,	we	focused	it	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	element	.
and	the	government	 agree 	 d 	 	to	do	that	and	not	do	 any 	 thing 	 	else	,	and	focus	our	energy	on	that	.
and	so	the	rest	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	was	a	public	space	.
and	with	a	million	people	there	a	day	,	it	just	felt	like	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	some	public	space	.
we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	an	 astro 	 turf 	 	 manufactur 	 er 	 	to	develop	a	mini	-	me	version	of	the	seed	 cat 	 hedral 	 	,	so	that	,	even	if	you	're	 partial 	 ly 	 	-	 sight 	 ed 	 	,	that	it	was	kind	of	 crunch 	 y 	 	and	soft	,	that	piece	of	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	that	you	see	there	.
and	then	,	you	know	when	a	pet	 ha 	 s 	 	an	operation	and	they	 s 	 have 	 	a	bit	of	the	skin	and	get	rid	of	the	fur	--	in	order	to	get	you	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	seed	 cat 	 hedral 	 	,	in	effect	,	we	've	 s 	 have 	 d 	 	it	.
and	 in 	 side 	 	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	;	there	's	no	famous	 a 	 ctor 	 	's	voice	;	there	's	no	 project 	 ions 	 	;	there	's	no	 tele 	 vision 	 s 	 	;	there	's	no	color	changing	.
there	's	just	silence	and	a	cool	temperature	.
and	if	a	cloud	 go 	 es 	 	past	,	you	can	see	a	cloud	on	the	 tip 	 s 	 	where	it	's	 lett 	 ing 	 	the	light	through	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	project	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	where	the	 finish 	 ed 	 	thing	 look 	 ed 	 	more	like	a	 render 	 ing 	 	than	our	 render 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
a	key	thing	was	how	people	would	interact	.
i	mean	,	in	a	way	it	was	the	most	serious	thing	you	could	possible	do	at	the	expo	.
and	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	.
the	british	government	--	any	government	is	 potential 	 ly 	 	the	worst	client	in	the	world	you	could	ever	possibly	want	to	have	.
and	there	was	a	lot	of	terror	.
but	there	was	an	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	support	.
and	so	there	was	a	moment	when	 sudden 	 ly 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	next	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	head	of	u.k.	trade	and	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	who	was	our	client	,	with	the	chinese	children	,	using	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
children	:	one	,	two	,	three	,	go	.
th	:	i	'm	sorry	about	my	stupid	voice	there	.
so	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 text 	 ure 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	.
in	the	 project 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	these	 s 	 lick 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	where	they	might	be	a	 f 	 ancy 	 	shape	,	but	the	 material 	 ity 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	the	same	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	research	 re 	 ally 	 	,	and	explore	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	.
and	the	project	that	we	're	building	in	malaysia	is	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	 building 	 s 	 	for	a	 proper 	 ty 	 	 develop 	 er 	 	.
and	it	's	in	a	piece	of	land	that	's	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	the	mayor	of	kuala	lumpur	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	 develop 	 er 	 	would	give	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 g 	 ave 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	back	to	the	city	,	they	would	give	them	more	gross	floor	area	,	 build 	 able 	 	.
so	there	was	an	incentive	for	the	 develop 	 er 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	try	to	think	about	what	would	be	better	for	the	city	.
and	the	 convention 	 al 	 	thing	with	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	 building 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	is	you	have	your	tower	,	and	you	 squeez 	 e 	 	a	few	 tree 	 s 	 	around	the	edge	,	and	you	see	 car 	 s 	 	 park 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	the	first	couple	of	 floor 	 s 	 	that	you	 re 	 ally 	 	experience	,	and	the	rest	of	it	is	just	for	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	.
the	 low 	 est 	 	value	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	bottom	part	of	a	tower	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	if	we	could	chop	that	away	and	give	the	building	a	small	bottom	,	we	could	take	that	bit	and	put	it	at	the	top	where	the	 great 	 er 	 	commercial	value	is	for	a	 proper 	 ty 	 	 develop 	 er 	 	.
and	by	 link 	 ing 	 	these	together	,	we	could	have	90	percent	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 on 	 ly 	 	10	percent	of	 scrub 	 by 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	and	bits	of	road	around	 building 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	building	these	 building 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	,	so	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	cost	-	effective	.
they	're	just	 chop 	 ped 	 	at	different	 height 	 s 	 	.
but	the	key	part	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	give	back	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	piece	of	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	engulf	it	.
and	that	's	my	final	slide	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
june	cohen	:	so	thank	you	.	thank	you	,	thomas	.	you	're	a	 de 	 light 	 	.
since	we	have	an	extra	minute	here	,	i	thought	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	you	could	tell	us	a	little	bit	about	these	 seed 	 s 	 	,	which	 may 	 be 	 	came	from	the	 s 	 have 	 d 	 	bit	of	the	building	.
th	:	these	are	a	few	of	the	 test 	 s 	 	we	did	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	building	the	structure	.
so	there	 we 	 re 	 	66,000	of	these	.
 th 	 is 	 	optic	was	22	feet	long	.
and	so	the	 day 	 light 	 	was	just	coming	--	it	was	caught	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	box	and	was	coming	down	to	illuminate	each	seed	.
 water 	 proof 	 ing 	 	the	building	was	a	bit	crazy	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	hard	to	 water 	 proof 	 	 building 	 s 	 	 any 	 way 	 	,	but	if	you	say	you	're	going	to	drill	66,000	 hole 	 s 	 	in	it	--	we	had	 quit 	 e 	 	a	time	.
there	was	one	person	in	the	 contract 	 ors 	 	who	was	the	right	 s 	 ize 	 	--	and	it	was	n't	a	child	--	who	could	fit	between	them	for	the	final	 water 	 proof 	 ing 	 	of	the	building	.
jc	:	thank	you	,	thomas	.
