i	should	tell	you	that	when	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	be	here	,	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	that	well	,	it	's	ted	.
and	these	tedsters	are	--	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	name	 sound 	 s 	 	--	these	are	the	 philanthro 	 pist 	 s 	 	and	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	sort	of	shape	our	world	.
and	what	could	i	possibly	have	to	say	that	would	be	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 just 	 ify 	 	my	 particip 	 ation 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	?
and	so	i	thought	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 civil 	 ized 	 	-	 sound 	 ing 	 	british	accent	might	help	 thing 	 s 	 	a	bit	.
and	then	i	thought	no	,	no	.	i	should	just	get	up	there	and	be	 my 	 self 	 	and	just	talk	the	way	i	 re 	 ally 	 	talk	 be 	 cause 	 	,	after	all	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	great	 unveil 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	i	thought	i	'd	come	up	here	and	unveil	my	real	voice	to	you	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	that	i	do	speak	the	 que 	 en 	 	's	english	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	from	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	,	new	york	.
but	the	theme	of	 th 	 is 	 	session	,	of	course	,	is	 invent 	 ion 	 	.
and	while	i	do	n't	have	any	 patent 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	aware	of	,	you	will	be	 meet 	 ing 	 	a	few	of	my	 invent 	 ions 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	suppose	it	's	fair	to	say	that	i	am	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	self	or	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	're	all	born	 in 	 to 	 	certain	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	with	 part 	 icular 	 	physical	 trait 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 ique 	 	 develop 	 mental 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	,	 geo 	 graphical 	 	and	 historic 	 al 	 	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	.
but	then	what	?
to	what	 ex 	 tent 	 	do	we	self	-	construct	,	do	we	self	-	invent	?
how	do	we	self	-	identify	and	how	 mut 	 able 	 	is	that	 ident 	 ity 	 	?
like	,	what	if	one	could	be	 any 	 one 	 	at	any	time	?
well	my	 character 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	in	my	 show 	 s 	 	,	allow	me	to	play	with	the	 space 	 s 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	've	 br 	 ought 	 	a	couple	of	them	with	me	.
and	well	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
what	i	should	tell	you	--	what	i	should	tell	you	is	that	they	've	each	prepared	 the 	 ir 	 	own	little	ted	 talk 	 s 	 	.

but	 any 	 way 	 	,	i	should	have	 start 	 ed 	 	by	 say 	 ing 	 	just	how	 luck 	 y 	 	i	feel	.
it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	an	eye	-	 open 	 ing 	 	experience	to	be	here	.

i	am	dominican	-	american	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	could	say	i	grew	up	in	the	capital	of	dominican	 re 	 public 	 	,	 other 	 wise 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	washington	 height 	 s 	 	in	new	york	city	.
but	i	do	n't	know	if	there	's	any	other	dominican	people	here	,	but	i	know	that	juan	enriquez	,	he	was	here	 yester 	 day 	 	.
and	i	think	he	's	mexican	,	so	that	's	--	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	close	 en 	 ough 	 	for	me	right	now	.	so	--	i	just	--	i	'm	sorry	.
i	'm	just	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	be	nervous	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	experience	for	me	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	just	--	you	know	i	'm	not	used	to	 do 	 ing 	 	the	public	 s 	 peaking 	 	.
and	 when 	 ever 	 	i	get	nervous	i	start	to	talk	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	.
 no 	 body 	 	can	understand	 noth 	 ing 	 	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	for	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	.
i	 usual 	 ly 	 	have	to	just	like	try	to	calm	down	and	take	a	deep	breath	.
but	then	on	top	of	that	,	you	know	,	sarah	jones	told	me	we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	18	 minute 	 s 	 	.
so	then	i	'm	like	,	should	i	be	nervous	,	you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	better	.
and	i	'm	just	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	panic	and	freak	out	.	so	i	like	,	take	a	deep	breath	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	sorry	.	so	 any 	 way 	 	,	what	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	is	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	love	ted	.
like	,	i	love	 every 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
like	,	it	's	--	i	ca	n't	get	over	 th 	 is 	 	right	now	.
and	,	like	,	people	would	not	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	where	i	'm	from	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	even	 exist 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	like	even	,	i	mean	i	love	like	the	name	,	the	--	ted	.
i	mean	i	know	it	's	a	real	person	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	but	i	'm	just	 say 	 ing 	 	that	like	,	you	know	,	i	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	how	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	acronym	,	you	know	,	which	is	like	,	you	know	,	is	like	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 con 	 cept 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
i	like	that	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	can	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	whole	like	acronym	thing	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	a	 s 	 op 	 homo 	 re 	 	at	college	right	now	.
at	my	school	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	was	part	of	co	-	 found 	 ing 	 	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	which	is	like	a	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	thing	,	you	know	,	like	you	 guy 	 s 	 	,	you	would	 re 	 ally 	 	like	it	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	da	bomb	,	a\and	da	bomb	--	not	like	what	you	 guy 	 s 	 	can	build	and	 every 	 thing 	 	--	it	's	like	,	da	bomb	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	like	dominican	--	it	's	an	acronym	--	dominican	-	american	 benevol 	 ent 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	for	 mother 	 s 	 	and	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
so	,	i	know	,	see	,	like	the	name	is	like	a	little	bit	long	,	but	with	the	war	on	terror	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	the	dean	of	student	 activ 	 ities 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	stop	 say 	 ing 	 	da	bomb	and	use	the	whole	thing	so	 no 	 body 	 	would	get	the	wrong	idea	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
so	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	like	da	bomb	--	what	dominican	-	american	 benevol 	 ent 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	for	 mother 	 s 	 	and	 bab 	 ies 	 	 do 	 es 	 	is	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	try	to	 advoc 	 ate 	 	for	 student 	 s 	 	who	show	a	lot	of	academic	promise	and	who	 al 	 so 	 	happen	to	be	 mother 	 s 	 	like	me	.
i	am	a	 work 	 ing 	 	mother	,	and	i	 al 	 so 	 	go	to	school	full	-	time	.
and	,	you	know	,	it	's	like	--	it	's	so	 import 	 ant 	 	to	have	like	role	 model 	 s 	 	out	there	.
i	mean	,	i	know	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	our	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
but	like	even	at	my	job	--	like	,	i	just	got	 promote 	 d 	 	.
right	now	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	for	me	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	the	 juni 	 or 	 	 assist 	 ant 	 	to	the	associate	director	under	the	senior	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	for	business	 develop 	 ment 	 	--	that	's	my	new	title	.
so	,	but	i	think	 whet 	 her 	 	you	own	your	own	company	or	you	're	just	 start 	 ing 	 	out	like	me	,	like	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	vital	for	people	to	just	 continu 	 e 	 	 expand 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	 every 	 body 	 	,	like	all	people	 re 	 ally 	 	had	access	to	that	,	it	would	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	world	out	there	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	know	you	know	.
so	,	i	think	all	people	,	we	need	that	,	but	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	i	look	at	people	like	me	,	you	know	like	,	i	mean	,	latinos	--	we	're	about	to	be	the	 major 	 ity 	 	,	in	like	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	deserve	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	to	be	part	of	the	 ex 	 change 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
so	,	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	that	you	're	,	you	know	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	,	making	the	 talk 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 on 	 line 	 	.
that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.	i	love	that	.
and	i	just	--	i	love	you	 guy 	 s 	 	.	i	love	ted	.
and	if	you	do	n't	mind	,	 private 	 ly 	 	now	,	in	the	future	,	i	'm	going	to	think	of	ted	 a 	 s 	 	an	acronym	for	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	dominicans	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
so	,	that	was	noraida	,	and	just	like	lorraine	and	 every 	 body 	 	else	you	're	 meet 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	these	are	 folk 	 s 	 	who	are	based	on	real	people	from	my	real	life	:	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	family	 member 	 s 	 	.

and	there	,	i	must	attend	these	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 ming 	 ling 	 	with	some	 tire 	 some 	 	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	me	feel	 comfort 	 able 	 	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	how	often	they	are	eating	the	 curr 	 y 	 	in	georgetown	.
so	,	you	can	just	imagine	--	right	.
so	,	but	i	'm	 thrill 	 ed 	 	to	be	 join 	 ing 	 	all	of	you	here	.
i	wish	we	had	more	time	together	,	but	that	's	for	 an 	 other 	 	time	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	great	.
and	,	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	i	do	n't	think	we	'll	have	time	for	you	to	meet	 every 	 body 	 	i	 br 	 ought 	 	,	but	--	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 behav 	 e 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	it	's	my	first	time	here	.
but	i	do	want	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	a	couple	of	 folk 	 s 	 	you	may	 recogn 	 ize 	 	,	if	you	saw	``	bridge	and	tunnel	.	``
uh	,	well	,	thank	you	.
good	 even 	 ing 	 	.
my	name	is	pauline	ning	,	and	first	i	want	to	tell	you	that	i	'm	--	of	course	i	am	a	member	of	the	chinese	community	in	new	york	.
but	when	sarah	jones	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	come	to	ted	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	you	know	,	first	,	i	do	n't	know	that	,	you	know	--	before	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	you	would	not	find	me	in	front	of	an	audience	of	people	,	much	less	like	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	not	like	to	give	 speech 	 es 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	feel	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 im 	 migrant 	 	,	i	do	not	have	good	english	 skill 	 s 	 	for	 s 	 peaking 	 	.
but	then	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	,	just	like	 govern 	 or 	 	arnold	schwarzenegger	,	i	try	 any 	 way 	 	.
my	daughter	--	my	daughter	wrote	that	,	she	told	me	,	``	 al 	 ways 	 	start	your	speech	with	humor	.	``
but	my	 back 	 ground 	 	--	i	want	to	tell	you	story	 on 	 ly 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	.
my	husband	and	i	,	we	 br 	 ought 	 	our	son	and	daughter	here	in	1980s	to	have	the	 free 	 dom 	 	we	can	not	have	in	 chin 	 a 	 	at	that	time	.
and	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	teach	our	 kid 	 s 	 	to	be	proud	of	 the 	 ir 	 	tradition	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	 im 	 migrant 	 	,	i	would	speak	chinese	to	them	,	and	they	would	 al 	 ways 	 	answer	me	back	in	english	.
they	love	rock	music	,	pop	culture	,	american	culture	.
but	when	they	got	 old 	 er 	 	,	when	the	time	 come 	 s 	 	for	them	to	start	think	about	 get 	 ting 	 	married	,	that	's	when	we	expect	them	to	 real 	 ize 	 	,	a	little	bit	more	,	 the 	 ir 	 	own	culture	.
but	that	's	where	we	had	some	 problem 	 s 	 	.
my	son	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	he	is	not	ready	to	get	married	.
and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 sweet 	 heart 	 	,	but	she	is	american	woman	,	not	chinese	.
it	's	not	that	it	's	bad	,	but	i	told	him	,	``	what	's	wrong	with	a	chinese	woman	?	``
but	i	think	he	will	change	his	mind	soon	.
so	,	then	i	decide	 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	will	 concent 	 rate 	 	on	my	daughter	.
the	daughter	's	marriage	is	 ver 	 y 	 	special	to	the	mom	.
but	first	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	she	's	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
she	 on 	 ly 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	time	with	her	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	then	at	college	,	it	's	like	she	never	came	home	.
and	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	me	to	come	and	visit	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	wrong	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	?	``
so	,	i	 accus 	 ed 	 	my	daughter	to	have	like	a	secret	boyfriend	.
but	she	told	me	,	``	mom	,	you	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	 boy 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	like	them	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	men	can	be	difficult	,	but	all	women	have	to	get	used	to	that	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	mom	.	i	mean	,	i	do	n't	like	 boy 	 s 	 	.	i	like	 girl 	 s 	 	.
i	am	lesbian	.	``
so	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	teach	my	 kid 	 s 	 	to	respect	american	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	i	told	my	daughter	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	exception	--	--	that	she	is	not	 ga 	 y 	 	,	she	is	just	 con 	 fused 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	american	problem	.
but	she	told	me	,	``	mom	,	it	's	not	american	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	she	is	in	love	--	in	love	with	a	nice	chinese	girl	.
so	,	these	are	the	 word 	 s 	 	i	am	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	hear	,	but	from	my	son	,	not	my	daughter	.
but	at	first	i	did	not	know	what	to	do	.
but	then	,	over	time	,	i	have	come	to	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	who	she	is	.
so	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	still	hard	,	i	will	share	with	you	that	it	 help 	 s 	 	me	to	 real 	 ize 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	more	 toler 	 ant 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	people	like	you	,	with	an	open	mind	.
so	i	think	 may 	 be 	 	ted	,	you	impact	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	ways	 may 	 be 	 	even	you	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	.
so	,	for	my	daughter	's	sake	,	i	thank	you	for	your	 idea 	 s 	 	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
thank	you	.	xie	xie	.
good	 even 	 ing 	 	.	my	name	is	habbi	belahal	.
and	i	would	like	to	first	of	all	thank	sarah	jones	for	 put 	 ting 	 	all	of	the	pressure	on	the	 on 	 ly 	 	arab	who	she	 br 	 ought 	 	with	her	to	be	last	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	am	 original 	 ly 	 	from	jordan	.
and	i	teach	 compar 	 ative 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	at	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	college	.
it	is	not	harvard	.
but	i	feel	a	bit	like	a	fish	out	of	water	.
but	i	am	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	my	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	i	see	that	a	few	of	them	did	make	it	here	to	the	 con 	 ference 	 	.
so	you	will	get	the	extra	credit	i	 promise 	 d 	 	you	.
but	,	while	i	know	that	i	may	not	look	like	the	typical	ted	-	izen	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	say	,	i	do	like	to	make	the	point	that	we	in	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	we	are	never	 a 	 s 	 	different	 a 	 s 	 	the	 appear 	 ance 	 s 	 	may	suggest	.
so	,	if	you	will	indulge	me	,	i	will	share	 quick 	 ly 	 	with	you	a	bit	of	verse	,	which	i	 memor 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	girl	at	16	 year 	 s 	 	of	age	.
so	,	back	in	the	ancient	 time 	 s 	 	.
[	arabic	]	and	 th 	 is 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	 transl 	 ates 	 	:	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	let	me	hold	your	hand	.
i	want	to	hold	your	hand	.
i	want	to	hold	your	hand	.
and	when	i	touch	you	,	i	feel	happy	 in 	 side 	 	.
it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	my	love	,	i	ca	n't	hide	,	i	ca	n't	hide	,	i	ca	n't	hide	.	``
well	,	so	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	but	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	but	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
if	it	is	 sound 	 ing 	 	familiar	,	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	at	the	same	time	in	my	life	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	beatles	.
on	the	radio	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	.
so	,	all	of	that	is	to	say	that	i	like	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	for	every	word	 intend 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	render	us	deaf	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	there	is	 al 	 ways 	 	a	lyric	 connect 	 ing 	 	 ear 	 s 	 	and	 heart 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 continent 	 s 	 	in	 rhym 	 e 	 	.
and	i	pray	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	that	we	will	self	-	invent	,	in	time	.
