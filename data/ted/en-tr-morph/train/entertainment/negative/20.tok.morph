i	think	i	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	talk	about	my	new	book	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	blink	,	``	and	it	's	about	snap	 judgment 	 s 	 	and	first	 impression 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	in	january	,	and	i	hope	you	all	buy	it	in	 trip 	 lic 	 ate 	 	.
but	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	my	new	book	 make 	 s 	 	me	happy	,	and	i	think	would	make	my	mother	happy	,	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	about	happiness	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	would	talk	about	 some 	 one 	 	who	i	think	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	to	make	americans	happy	 a 	 s 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	over	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	a	man	who	is	a	great	personal	hero	of	mine	:	 some 	 one 	 	by	the	name	of	howard	moskowitz	,	who	is	most	famous	for	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	spaghetti	sauce	.
howard	's	about	 th 	 is 	 	high	,	and	he	's	round	,	and	he	's	in	his	60s	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	big	huge	 glass 	 es 	 	and	 thin 	 ning 	 	 gr 	 ey 	 	hair	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 ex 	 uber 	 ance 	 	and	 vital 	 ity 	 	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 par 	 rot 	 	,	and	he	 love 	 s 	 	the	opera	,	and	he	's	a	great	aficionado	of	 med 	 ieval 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	by	profession	,	he	's	a	 psycho 	 physicist 	 	.
now	,	i	should	tell	you	that	i	have	no	idea	what	 psycho 	 physics 	 	is	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	at	some	point	in	my	life	,	i	 d 	 ated 	 	a	girl	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	who	was	 get 	 ting 	 	her	 doctor 	 ate 	 	in	 psycho 	 physics 	 	.
which	should	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	relationship	.
 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	know	,	 psycho 	 physics 	 	is	about	 measur 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	howard	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 measur 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 graduate 	 d 	 	with	his	 doctor 	 ate 	 	from	harvard	,	and	he	set	up	a	little	 consult 	 ing 	 	shop	in	white	 plain 	 s 	 	,	new	york	.
and	one	of	his	first	 client 	 s 	 	was	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	back	in	the	early	'70s	--	one	of	his	first	 client 	 s 	 	was	pepsi	.
and	pepsi	came	to	howard	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	new	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 par 	 tame 	 	,	and	we	would	like	to	make	diet	pepsi	.
we	'd	like	you	to	figure	out	how	much	 a 	 s 	 par 	 tame 	 	we	should	put	in	each	can	of	diet	pepsi	,	in	order	to	have	the	perfect	drink	.	``	right	?
now	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	question	to	answer	,	and	that	's	what	howard	thought	.	 be 	 cause 	 	pepsi	told	him	,	``	look	,	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	a	band	between	eight	and	12	percent	.
 any 	 thing 	 	 be 	 low 	 	eight	percent	 sweet 	 ness 	 	is	not	sweet	 en 	 ough 	 	;	 any 	 thing 	 	above	12	percent	 sweet 	 ness 	 	is	too	sweet	.
we	want	to	know	:	what	's	the	sweet	spot	between	eight	and	12	?	``
now	,	if	i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	problem	to	do	,	you	would	all	say	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
what	we	do	is	you	make	up	a	big	 experiment 	 al 	 	batch	of	pepsi	,	at	every	degree	of	 sweet 	 ness 	 	--	eight	percent	,	8.1	,	8.2	,	8.3	,	all	the	way	up	to	12	--	and	we	try	 th 	 is 	 	out	with	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	,	and	we	plot	the	 result 	 s 	 	on	a	 curv 	 e 	 	,	and	we	take	the	most	popular	 concent 	 ration 	 	.	right	?	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	.
howard	 do 	 es 	 	the	experiment	,	and	he	 get 	 s 	 	the	data	back	,	and	he	 plot 	 s 	 	it	on	a	 curv 	 e 	 	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	he	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	it	's	not	a	nice	bell	 curv 	 e 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	data	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	.
it	's	a	mess	.	it	's	all	over	the	place	.
now	,	most	people	in	that	business	,	in	the	world	of	 test 	 ing 	 	food	and	 s 	 uch 	 	,	are	not	 dis 	 may 	 ed 	 	when	the	data	 come 	 s 	 	back	a	mess	.
they	think	,	well	,	you	know	,	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	what	people	think	about	 col 	 a 	 	's	not	that	easy	.
you	know	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	made	an	error	 some 	 where 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
you	know	,	let	's	just	make	an	educated	guess	,	and	they	 simpl 	 y 	 	point	and	they	go	for	10	percent	,	right	in	the	middle	.
howard	is	not	so	 eas 	 ily 	 	 placate 	 d 	 	.
howard	is	a	man	of	a	certain	degree	of	intellectual	 standard 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	for	him	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	question	 be 	 devil 	 ed 	 	him	for	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	he	would	think	it	through	and	say	,	what	was	wrong	?
why	could	we	not	make	sense	of	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	with	diet	pepsi	?
and	one	day	,	he	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	 din 	 er 	 	in	white	 plain 	 s 	 	,	about	to	go	 try 	 ing 	 	to	dream	up	some	work	for	nescafe	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	like	a	bolt	of	 light 	 ning 	 	,	the	answer	came	to	him	.
and	that	is	,	that	when	they	 analyz 	 ed 	 	the	diet	pepsi	data	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	wrong	question	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	the	perfect	pepsi	,	and	they	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	looking	for	the	perfect	pepsis	.	trust	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	enormous	 revel 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	most	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	in	all	of	food	science	.
and	howard	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	went	on	the	road	,	and	he	would	go	to	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	around	the	country	,	and	he	would	stand	up	and	he	would	say	,	``	you	had	 be 	 en 	 	looking	for	the	perfect	pepsi	.	you	're	wrong	.
you	should	be	looking	for	the	perfect	pepsis	.	``
and	people	would	look	at	him	with	a	blank	look	,	and	they	would	say	,	``	what	are	you	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	 crazi 	 ness 	 	.	``
and	they	would	say	,	you	know	,	``	move	!	next	!	``
 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	business	,	 no 	 body 	 	would	hire	him	--	he	was	 obsess 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	and	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	and	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	and	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	.
howard	 love 	 s 	 	the	yiddish	 express 	 ion 	 	``	to	a	worm	in	 horse 	 rad 	 ish 	 	,	the	world	is	 horse 	 rad 	 ish 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	his	 horse 	 rad 	 ish 	 	.	he	was	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	it	!
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	he	had	a	 break 	 through 	 	.	vlasic	 pick 	 les 	 	came	to	him	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mr.	moskowitz	--	doctor	moskowitz	--	we	want	to	make	the	perfect	 pick 	 le 	 	.	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	is	no	perfect	 pick 	 le 	 	;	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	perfect	 pick 	 les 	 	.	``
and	he	came	back	to	them	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	do	n't	just	need	to	improve	your	regular	;	you	need	to	create	 ze 	 s 	 ty 	 	.	``
and	that	's	where	we	got	 ze 	 s 	 ty 	 	 pick 	 les 	 	.
then	the	next	person	came	to	him	,	and	that	was	campbell	's	soup	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.	in	fact	,	campbell	's	soup	is	where	howard	made	his	reputation	.
campbell	's	made	prego	,	and	prego	,	in	the	early	'80s	,	was	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	next	to	ragu	,	which	was	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	spaghetti	sauce	of	the	'70s	and	'80s	.
now	in	the	industry	--	i	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	you	care	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	how	much	time	i	have	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	it	was	,	 technical 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 a 	 side 	 	--	prego	is	a	better	tomato	sauce	than	ragu	.
the	quality	of	the	tomato	paste	is	much	better	;	the	spice	mix	is	far	 super 	 ior 	 	;	it	 adhere 	 s 	 	to	the	 past 	 a 	 	in	a	much	more	 pleas 	 ing 	 	way	.	in	fact	,	they	would	do	the	famous	bowl	test	back	in	the	'70s	with	ragu	and	prego	.
you	'd	have	a	plate	of	spaghetti	,	and	you	would	pour	it	on	,	right	?
and	the	ragu	would	all	go	to	the	bottom	,	and	the	prego	would	 s 	 it 	 	on	top	.
that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 adhere 	 nce 	 	.	``
and	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	far	 super 	 ior 	 	in	 adhere 	 nce 	 	,	and	the	quality	of	 the 	 ir 	 	tomato	paste	,	prego	was	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	.
so	they	came	to	howard	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	fix	us	.
and	howard	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	product	line	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	you	have	is	a	dead	tomato	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	want	to	do	.
and	he	got	together	with	the	campbell	's	soup	kitchen	,	and	he	made	45	 varie 	 ties 	 	of	spaghetti	sauce	.	and	he	 vari 	 ed 	 	them	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	every	 conceiv 	 able 	 	way	that	you	can	vary	tomato	sauce	:	by	 sweet 	 ness 	 	,	by	level	of	 gar 	 lic 	 	,	by	 tart 	 ness 	 	,	by	 s 	 our 	 ness 	 	,	by	tomatoey	-	ness	,	by	visible	 solid 	 s 	 	--	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	term	in	the	spaghetti	sauce	business	.
every	 conceiv 	 able 	 	way	you	can	vary	spaghetti	sauce	,	he	 vari 	 ed 	 	spaghetti	sauce	.
and	then	he	took	 th 	 is 	 	whole	raft	of	45	spaghetti	 sauce 	 s 	 	,	and	he	went	on	the	road	.
he	went	to	new	york	;	he	went	to	chicago	;	he	went	to	jacksonville	;	he	went	to	los	angeles	.	and	he	 br 	 ought 	 	in	people	by	the	 truck 	 load 	 	.	 in 	 to 	 	big	 hall 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 at 	 	them	down	for	two	 hour 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 g 	 ave 	 	them	,	over	the	course	of	that	two	 hour 	 s 	 	,	ten	 bowl 	 s 	 	.
ten	small	 bowl 	 s 	 	of	 past 	 a 	 	,	with	a	different	spaghetti	sauce	on	each	one	.
and	after	they	ate	each	bowl	,	they	had	to	rate	,	from	0	to	100	,	how	good	they	thought	the	spaghetti	sauce	was	.
at	the	end	of	that	process	,	after	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	 month 	 s 	 	and	 month 	 s 	 	,	he	had	a	mountain	of	data	about	how	the	american	people	feel	about	spaghetti	sauce	.
and	then	he	 analyz 	 ed 	 	the	data	.
now	,	did	he	look	for	the	most	popular	brand	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	spaghetti	sauce	?	no	!
howard	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	data	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	let	's	see	if	we	can	group	all	these	different	data	 point 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 cluster 	 s 	 	.
let	's	see	if	they	 congreg 	 ate 	 	around	certain	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	if	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	,	and	you	 analyz 	 e 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	data	on	spaghetti	sauce	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	all	americans	fall	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	three	 group 	 s 	 	.
there	are	people	who	like	 the 	 ir 	 	spaghetti	sauce	plain	;	there	are	people	who	like	 the 	 ir 	 	spaghetti	sauce	 s 	 pic 	 y 	 	;	and	there	are	people	who	like	it	extra	 chunk 	 y 	 	.
and	of	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 fact 	 s 	 	,	the	third	one	was	the	most	significant	,	 be 	 cause 	 	at	the	time	,	in	the	early	1980s	,	if	you	went	to	a	 super 	 market 	 	,	you	would	not	find	extra	-	 chunk 	 y 	 	spaghetti	sauce	.
and	prego	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	howard	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	one	third	of	americans	 crav 	 e 	 	extra	-	 chunk 	 y 	 	spaghetti	sauce	and	yet	no	one	is	 serv 	 ic 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 need 	 s 	 	?	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	!
and	prego	then	went	back	,	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 reform 	 ulated 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	spaghetti	sauce	,	and	came	out	with	a	line	of	extra	 chunk 	 y 	 	that	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	took	over	the	spaghetti	sauce	business	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
and	over	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	made	600	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	off	 the 	 ir 	 	line	of	extra	-	 chunk 	 y 	 	 sauce 	 s 	 	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	else	in	the	industry	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	howard	had	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	my	god	!	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	all	wrong	!	``
and	that	's	when	you	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	seven	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 vine 	 gar 	 	,	and	14	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 must 	 ard 	 	,	and	71	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 o 	 live 	 	oil	--	and	then	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	even	ragu	 hire 	 d 	 	howard	,	and	howard	did	the	exact	same	thing	for	ragu	that	he	did	for	prego	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	if	you	go	to	the	 super 	 market 	 	,	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	one	,	and	you	look	at	how	 man 	 y 	 	 rag 	 us 	 	there	are	--	do	you	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	they	are	?	36	!
in	six	 varie 	 ties 	 	:	cheese	,	light	,	robusto	,	rich	&	 heart 	 y 	 	,	old	world	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	extra	-	 chunk 	 y 	 	garden	.
that	's	howard	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.	that	is	howard	's	gift	to	the	american	people	.
now	why	is	that	 import 	 ant 	 	?
it	is	,	in	fact	,	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	i	'll	explain	to	you	why	.
what	howard	did	is	he	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	the	food	industry	 think 	 s 	 	about	making	you	happy	.
assumption	number	one	in	the	food	industry	used	to	be	that	the	way	to	find	out	what	people	want	to	eat	--	what	will	make	people	happy	--	is	to	ask	them	.
and	for	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	,	ragu	and	prego	would	have	focus	 group 	 s 	 	,	and	they	would	 s 	 it 	 	all	you	people	down	,	and	they	would	say	,	``	what	do	you	want	in	a	spaghetti	sauce	?	tell	us	what	you	want	in	a	spaghetti	sauce	.	``
and	for	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	--	20	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	--	through	all	 t 	 hose 	 	focus	group	 session 	 s 	 	,	no	one	ever	 s 	 aid 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	extra	-	 chunk 	 y 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	third	of	them	,	deep	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 heart 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	.
people	do	n't	know	what	they	want	!	right	?
 a 	 s 	 	howard	 love 	 s 	 	to	say	,	``	the	mind	 know 	 s 	 	not	what	the	tongue	 want 	 s 	 	.	``
it	's	a	 myster 	 y 	 	!
and	a	 critical 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	step	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	our	own	 desir 	 es 	 	and	 taste 	 s 	 	is	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	we	can	not	 al 	 ways 	 	explain	what	we	want	deep	down	.
if	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	all	of	you	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	what	you	want	in	a	coffee	,	you	know	what	you	'd	say	?	every	one	of	you	would	say	,	``	i	want	a	dark	,	rich	,	 heart 	 y 	 	roast	.	``
it	's	what	people	 al 	 ways 	 	say	when	you	ask	them	what	they	want	in	a	coffee	.
what	do	you	like	?	dark	,	rich	,	 heart 	 y 	 	roast	!
what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	a	dark	,	rich	,	 heart 	 y 	 	roast	?
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	howard	,	 some 	 where 	 	between	25	and	27	percent	of	you	.
most	of	you	like	 milk 	 y 	 	,	weak	coffee	.
but	you	will	never	,	ever	say	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ask 	 s 	 	you	what	you	want	that	``	i	want	a	 milk 	 y 	 	,	weak	coffee	.	``
so	that	's	number	one	thing	that	howard	did	.
number	two	thing	that	howard	did	is	he	made	us	 real 	 ize 	 	--	it	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	critical	point	--	he	made	us	 real 	 ize 	 	in	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	what	he	 like 	 s 	 	to	call	``	 horizon 	 tal 	 	 segment 	 ation 	 	.	``
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	critical	?	it	's	critical	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	the	food	industry	thought	before	howard	.	right	?
what	 we 	 re 	 	they	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	in	the	early	'80s	?	they	 we 	 re 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 must 	 ard 	 	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	the	story	of	 gr 	 ey 	 	poupon	.	right	?
used	to	be	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 must 	 ard 	 s 	 	.	french	's	and	gulden	's	.
what	 we 	 re 	 	they	?	yellow	 must 	 ard 	 	.	what	's	in	yellow	 must 	 ard 	 	?
yellow	 must 	 ard 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	,	turmeric	,	and	paprika	.	that	was	 must 	 ard 	 	.
 gr 	 ey 	 	poupon	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	with	a	dijon	.	right	?
much	more	 volatil 	 e 	 	 brow 	 n 	 	 must 	 ard 	 	seed	,	some	white	wine	,	a	nose	hit	,	much	more	 delic 	 ate 	 	 aroma 	 tics 	 	.	and	what	do	they	do	?
they	put	it	in	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	glass	jar	,	with	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 e 	 name 	 led 	 	label	on	it	,	made	it	look	french	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	made	in	oxnard	,	california	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	charging	a	dollar	-	fifty	for	the	eight	-	ounce	bottle	,	the	way	that	french	's	and	gulden	's	did	,	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	charge	four	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	then	they	had	 t 	 hose 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	,	right	?	with	the	guy	in	the	 roll 	 s 	 	royce	,	and	he	's	eating	the	 gr 	 ey 	 	poupon	.	the	other	 roll 	 s 	 	royce	 pull 	 s 	 	up	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	do	you	have	any	 gr 	 ey 	 	poupon	?
and	the	whole	thing	,	after	they	did	that	,	 gr 	 ey 	 	poupon	 take 	 s 	 	off	!
 take 	 s 	 	over	the	 must 	 ard 	 	business	!
and	 every 	 one 	 	's	take	-	home	 less 	 on 	 	from	that	was	that	the	way	to	get	to	make	people	happy	is	to	give	them	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	more	expensive	,	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 aspir 	 e 	 	to	.	right	?
it	's	to	make	them	turn	 the 	 ir 	 	back	on	what	they	think	they	like	now	,	and	reach	out	for	 some 	 thing 	 	 high 	 er 	 	up	the	 must 	 ard 	 	 hierarch 	 y 	 	.
a	better	 must 	 ard 	 	!	a	more	expensive	 must 	 ard 	 	!
a	 must 	 ard 	 	of	more	 sophistic 	 ation 	 	and	culture	and	meaning	.
and	howard	 look 	 ed 	 	to	that	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	that	's	wrong	!
 must 	 ard 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	exist	on	a	 hierarch 	 y 	 	.
 must 	 ard 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	,	just	like	tomato	sauce	,	on	a	 horizon 	 tal 	 	plane	.
there	is	no	good	 must 	 ard 	 	or	bad	 must 	 ard 	 	.
there	is	no	perfect	 must 	 ard 	 	or	 im 	 perfect 	 	 must 	 ard 	 	.
there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 must 	 ard 	 s 	 	that	suit	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	.
he	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 democrat 	 ized 	 	the	way	we	think	about	taste	.
and	for	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	we	owe	howard	moskowitz	a	huge	vote	of	 thank 	 s 	 	.
third	thing	that	howard	did	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	is	howard	 confront 	 ed 	 	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	 plat 	 on 	 ic 	 	dish	.
what	do	i	mean	by	that	?
for	the	 long 	 est 	 	time	in	the	food	industry	,	there	was	a	sense	that	there	was	one	way	,	a	perfect	way	,	to	make	a	dish	.
you	go	to	chez	panisse	,	they	give	you	the	red	-	tail	sashimi	with	 roast 	 ed 	 	 pump 	 kin 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	in	a	 some 	 thing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 r 	 eduction 	 	.
they	do	n't	give	you	five	 option 	 s 	 	on	the	 r 	 eduction 	 	,	right	?
they	do	n't	say	,	do	you	want	the	extra	-	 chunk 	 y 	 	 r 	 eduction 	 	,	or	do	you	want	the	--	no	!
you	just	get	the	 r 	 eduction 	 	.	why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	the	chef	at	chez	panisse	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 plat 	 on 	 ic 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	about	red	-	tail	sashimi	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	it	ought	to	be	.
and	she	 serve 	 s 	 	it	that	way	time	and	time	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	if	you	 quar 	 rel 	 	with	her	,	she	will	say	,	``	you	know	what	?	you	're	wrong	!	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	best	way	it	ought	to	be	in	 th 	 is 	 	restaurant	.	``
now	that	same	idea	 fuel 	 ed 	 	the	commercial	food	industry	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
they	had	a	 not 	 ion 	 	,	a	 plat 	 on 	 ic 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	,	of	what	tomato	sauce	was	.
and	where	did	that	come	from	?	it	came	from	italy	.
italian	tomato	sauce	is	what	?	it	's	 blend 	 ed 	 	;	it	's	thin	.
the	culture	of	tomato	sauce	was	thin	.
when	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	authentic	tomato	sauce	in	the	1970s	,	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	italian	tomato	sauce	.	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	 rag 	 us 	 	,	which	had	no	visible	 solid 	 s 	 	,	right	?
which	 we 	 re 	 	thin	,	and	you	just	put	a	little	bit	over	it	and	it	 s 	 un 	 k 	 	down	to	the	bottom	of	the	 past 	 a 	 	.
that	's	what	it	was	.	and	why	 we 	 re 	 	we	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	thought	that	what	it	took	to	make	people	happy	was	to	provide	them	with	the	most	 cultural 	 ly 	 	authentic	tomato	sauce	,	a	;	and	b	,	we	thought	that	if	we	 g 	 ave 	 	them	the	 cultural 	 ly 	 	authentic	tomato	sauce	,	then	they	would	embrace	it	.
and	that	's	what	would	 pleas 	 e 	 	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	number	of	people	.
and	the	reason	we	thought	that	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	people	in	the	 cook 	 ing 	 	world	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	 cook 	 ing 	 	 universal 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	one	way	to	treat	all	of	us	.
and	it	's	good	reason	for	them	to	be	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	the	idea	of	 universal 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	science	,	through	the	19th	century	and	much	of	the	20th	,	was	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 universal 	 s 	 	.
 psycho 	 logists 	 	,	medical	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 economist 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 find 	 ing 	 	out	the	 rule 	 s 	 	that	govern	the	way	all	of	us	 behav 	 e 	 	.
but	that	 change 	 d 	 	,	right	?
what	is	the	great	revolution	in	science	of	the	last	10	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	?
it	is	the	 move 	 ment 	 	from	the	search	for	 universal 	 s 	 	to	the	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 vari 	 ability 	 	.
now	in	medical	science	,	we	do	n't	want	to	know	how	 necess 	 arily 	 	--	just	how	cancer	 work 	 s 	 	,	we	want	to	know	how	your	cancer	is	different	from	my	cancer	.
i	guess	my	cancer	different	from	your	cancer	.
 genetic 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	the	door	to	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	human	 vari 	 ability 	 	.
what	howard	moskowitz	was	 do 	 ing 	 	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	same	revolution	 need 	 s 	 	to	happen	in	the	world	of	tomato	sauce	.
and	for	that	,	we	owe	him	a	great	vote	of	 thank 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	one	last	 illustr 	 ation 	 	of	 vari 	 ability 	 	,	and	that	is	--	oh	,	i	'm	sorry	.
howard	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	,	but	he	took	it	a	second	step	,	which	was	to	say	that	when	we	pursue	universal	 principle 	 s 	 	in	food	,	we	are	n't	just	making	an	error	;	we	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	massive	 dis 	 service 	 	.
and	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	he	used	was	coffee	.
and	coffee	is	 some 	 thing 	 	he	did	a	lot	of	work	with	,	with	nescafe	.
if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	ask	all	of	you	to	try	and	come	up	with	a	brand	of	coffee	--	a	type	of	coffee	,	a	brew	--	that	made	all	of	you	happy	,	and	then	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	to	rate	that	coffee	,	the	average	score	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	for	coffee	would	be	about	60	on	a	scale	of	0	to	100	.
if	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	you	 allow 	 ed 	 	me	to	break	you	 in 	 to 	 	coffee	 cluster 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	three	or	four	coffee	 cluster 	 s 	 	,	and	i	could	make	coffee	just	for	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	individual	 cluster 	 s 	 	,	your	 score 	 s 	 	would	go	from	60	to	75	or	78	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	coffee	at	60	and	coffee	at	78	is	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	coffee	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	 win 	 ce 	 	,	and	coffee	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	 deli 	 r 	 iously 	 	happy	.
that	is	the	final	,	and	i	think	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 less 	 on 	 	,	of	howard	moskowitz	:	that	in	 em 	 bracing 	 	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	we	will	find	a	 sur 	 er 	 	way	to	true	happiness	.
thank	you	.
