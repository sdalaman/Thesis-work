chris	anderson	:	no	,	you	ca	n't	start	the	three	 minute 	 s 	 	.
 re 	 set 	 	the	three	 minute 	 s 	 	,	that	's	just	not	fair	.
ah	:	oh	my	god	,	it	's	harsh	up	here	.
i	mean	i	'm	nervous	 en 	 ough 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	.
but	i	am	not	 a 	 s 	 	nervous	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	five	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
five	 week 	 s 	 	ago	i	had	total	hip	 re 	 placement 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
do	you	know	that	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	?
electric	saw	,	power	drill	,	 total 	 ly 	 	 disgust 	 ing 	 	 un 	 less 	 	you	're	david	bolinsky	,	in	which	case	it	's	all	truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
 s 	 ure 	 	david	,	if	it	's	not	your	hip	,	it	's	truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	did	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 epiph 	 any 	 	around	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	so	chris	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	to	tell	you	about	it	.
but	first	you	need	to	know	two	 thing 	 s 	 	about	me	.
just	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	canadian	,	and	i	'm	the	 young 	 est 	 	of	seven	 kid 	 s 	 	.
now	,	in	canada	,	we	have	that	great	 health 	 care 	 	system	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	get	our	new	 hip 	 s 	 	for	free	.
and	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 young 	 est 	 	of	seven	,	i	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	at	the	front	of	the	line	for	 any 	 thing 	 	.	ok	?
so	my	hip	had	 be 	 en 	 	 hurt 	 ing 	 	me	for	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	 final 	 ly 	 	went	to	the	doctor	,	which	was	free	.
and	she	 refer 	 red 	 	me	to	an	 ortho 	 pedic 	 	surgeon	,	 al 	 so 	 	free	.
 final 	 ly 	 	got	to	see	him	after	10	 month 	 s 	 	of	 wait 	 ing 	 	--	 al 	 most 	 	a	year	.
that	is	what	free	 get 	 s 	 	you	.
i	met	the	surgeon	,	and	he	took	some	free	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	,	and	i	got	a	good	look	at	them	.	and	you	know	,	even	i	could	tell	my	hip	was	bad	,	and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	in	 market 	 ing 	 	.
so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	allison	,	we	've	got	to	get	you	on	the	table	.
i	'm	going	to	replace	your	hip	--	it	's	about	an	18	-	month	wait	.	``
18	more	 month 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	 al 	 ready 	 	 wait 	 ed 	 	10	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	i	had	to	wait	18	more	 month 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	long	wait	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	even	think	about	it	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	teds	.
i	would	n't	have	my	new	hip	for	 th 	 is 	 	ted	.
i	would	n't	have	my	new	hip	for	tedglobal	in	africa	.
i	would	not	have	my	new	hip	for	ted	2008	.
i	would	still	be	on	my	bad	hip	.	that	was	so	 disappoint 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	i	left	his	 off 	 ice 	 	and	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	through	the	hospital	,	and	that	's	when	i	had	my	 epiph 	 any 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 young 	 est 	 	of	seven	had	to	get	 her 	 self 	 	to	the	front	of	the	line	.
oh	 yea 	 h 	 	.
can	i	tell	you	how	un	-	canadian	that	is	?
we	do	not	think	that	way	.
we	do	n't	talk	about	it	.	it	's	not	even	a	 consider 	 ation 	 	.
in	fact	,	when	we	're	 travel 	 ing 	 	 a 	 broad 	 	,	it	's	how	we	identify	fellow	canadians	.
``	after	you	.	``	``	oh	,	no	,	no	.	after	you	.	``
 he 	 y 	 	,	are	you	from	canada	?	``	oh	,	me	too	!	hi	!	``
``	great	!	 excel 	 lent 	 	!	``
so	no	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	i	was	n't	 a 	 verse 	 	to	 butt 	 ing 	 	any	 geez 	 er 	 	off	the	list	.
some	70	-	year	-	old	who	 want 	 ed 	 	his	new	hip	so	he	could	be	back	 golf 	 ing 	 	,	or	 garden 	 ing 	 	.
no	,	no	.	front	of	the	line	.
so	by	now	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	the	lobby	,	and	of	course	,	that	hurt	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	my	hip	,	and	i	kind	of	 need 	 ed 	 	a	sign	.
and	i	saw	a	sign	.
in	the	window	of	the	hospital	's	 tin 	 y 	 	gift	shop	there	was	a	sign	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 volunteer 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	.	``	hmm	.
well	,	they	 sign 	 ed 	 	me	up	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
no	 re 	 ference 	 	 check 	 s 	 	.	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	usual	 back 	 ground 	 	stuff	,	no	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	desperate	for	 volunteer 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	average	age	of	the	volunteer	at	the	hospital	gift	shop	was	75	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.	they	 need 	 ed 	 	some	young	blood	.
so	,	next	thing	you	know	,	i	had	my	bright	blue	volunteer	vest	,	i	had	my	photo	id	,	and	i	was	fully	trained	by	my	89	-	year	-	old	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
every	friday	 morn 	 ing 	 	i	was	at	the	gift	shop	.
while	 ring 	 ing 	 	in	hospital	staff	's	tic	tacs	,	i	'd	 casual 	 ly 	 	ask	,	``	what	do	you	do	?	``
then	i	'd	tell	them	,	``	well	,	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	my	hip	 replace 	 d 	 	--	in	18	 month 	 s 	 	.
it	's	gon	na	be	so	great	when	the	pain	 stop 	 s 	 	.	ow	!	``
all	the	staff	got	to	know	the	 pluck 	 y 	 	,	young	volunteer	.
my	next	surgeon	's	appointment	was	,	 co 	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	right	after	a	shift	at	the	gift	shop	.
so	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	i	had	my	vest	and	my	 ident 	 ification 	 	.
i	 dra 	 ped 	 	them	 casual 	 ly 	 	over	the	chair	in	the	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	you	know	,	when	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	,	i	could	just	tell	that	he	saw	them	.
 moment 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	had	a	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	date	just	 week 	 s 	 	away	,	and	a	big	fat	prescription	for	percocet	.
now	,	word	on	the	street	was	that	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	my	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	that	got	me	to	the	front	of	the	line	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	'm	not	even	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	of	that	.
two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	i	am	going	to	take	 s 	 uch 	 	good	care	of	 th 	 is 	 	new	hip	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	i	intend	to	stick	with	the	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 epiph 	 any 	 	of	them	all	.
even	when	a	canadian	 cheat 	 s 	 	the	system	,	they	do	it	in	a	way	that	 benefit 	 s 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
