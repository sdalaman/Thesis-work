welcome	to	africa	!	or	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	i	should	say	,	welcome	home	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	it	all	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
looking	at	 fossil 	 s 	 	 d 	 ating 	 	back	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	--	it	all	 point 	 s 	 	to	evidence	that	life	for	the	human	species	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	 beg 	 an 	 	right	here	.
we	are	on	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	journey	the	next	four	 day 	 s 	 	.
you	're	going	to	hear	 st 	 ories 	 	of	``	africa	:	the	next	chapter	.	``
fantastic	 tale 	 s 	 	,	 anecdote 	 s 	 	from	 speaker 	 s 	 	.
but	i	want	to	turn	that	 up 	 side 	 	down	for	a	moment	,	and	get	 some 	 thing 	 	out	on	the	table	and	clear	the	air	so	to	say	.
what	's	the	worst	thing	you	've	ever	heard	about	africa	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 rhetoric 	 al 	 	question	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	 answer 	 s 	 	from	you	.
go	for	it	!	the	worst	.
famine	.
 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
more	.
genocide	.
 aid 	 s 	 	.
 slave 	 ry 	 	.
that	's	 en 	 ough 	 	.
we	've	all	heard	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	africa	,	the	story	we	have	not	heard	.
the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	we	want	to	know	,	and	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	do	exist	about	positive	 tale 	 s 	 	.
a	part	of	my	talk	is	going	to	be	about	 invest 	 ment 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	exist	on	 th 	 is 	 	continent	,	to	 separat 	 e 	 	the	rhetoric	from	the	 re 	 ality 	 	,	the	fact	from	the	fiction	.
to	go	to	the	actual	data	and	 statistic 	 s 	 	that	exist	about	the	actual	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	ground	that	make	africa	a	realistic	 invest 	 ment 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	option	for	you	.
so	let	's	get	going	 be 	 cause 	 	africa	,	to	some	degree	,	is	on	a	 turn 	 around 	 	.
a	 turn 	 around 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	how	it	 manage 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	image	,	and	how	it	 take 	 s 	 	control	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
and	 turn 	 around 	 s 	 	are	part	and	parcel	of	what	i	have	focused	on	for	most	of	my	professional	 care 	 er 	 	.
and	it	all	 start 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	a	decade	ago	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	 consult 	 ant 	 	at	mckinsey	&	company	at	 the 	 ir 	 	first	african	 off 	 ice 	 	in	johannesburg	.
and	there	we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	 lead 	 ing 	 	ceos	on	african	 issue 	 s 	 	,	and	african	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	on	 turn 	 around 	 s 	 	,	making	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	not	just	the	best	in	africa	but	the	best	 global 	 ly 	 	.
but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 form 	 al 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	focus	on	 turn 	 around 	 s 	 	when	i	was	 comple 	 ting 	 	my	mba	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
it	all	 beg 	 an 	 	with	a	fantastic	phone	call	.
it	was	from	rosabeth	moss	kanter	,	harvard	business	school	guru	and	a	professor	of	mine	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	to	write	a	case	,	euvin	--	a	case	on	a	public	-	sector	 lead 	 er 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	for	the	corporate	world	.	``
and	the	 lead 	 er 	 	that	came	to	mind	was	nelson	mandela	.
 be 	 cause 	 	nelson	mandela	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	took	over	power	 a 	 s 	 	the	first	 democrat 	 ically 	 	-	 elect 	 ed 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	of	south	africa	,	 face 	 d 	 	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	of	a	country	that	could	have	slid	 in 	 to 	 	the	abyss	of	 cha 	 os 	 	.
but	he	 start 	 ed 	 	the	country	on	a	path	of	a	positive	cycle	.
now	the	case	,	``	nelson	mandela	:	change	 lead 	 er 	 	,	``	 be 	 came 	 	part	of	the	research	base	for	a	chapter	in	rosabeth	's	new	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	confidence	.	``
and	``	confidence	``	 be 	 came 	 	a	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 best 	 seller 	 	and	 top 	 ped 	 	business	week	's	 hard 	 cover 	 	 best 	 seller 	 	list	.
and	why	i	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	was	 interview 	 ed 	 	on	sabc	africa	,	on	a	pan	-	african	 broad 	 cast 	 	,	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	what	is	your	key	 less 	 on 	 	,	or	the	key	thing	you	enjoy	the	most	?	``	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	huge	privilege	to	be	part	of	 s 	 uch 	 	a	project	.
the	 less 	 on 	 	from	that	was	that	it	was	africa	--	an	african	story	--	that	was	used	to	share	news	with	the	rest	of	the	world	of	what	the	 bench 	 mark 	 	can	be	for	corporate	 turn 	 around 	 s 	 	.
africa	was	 be 	 ing 	 	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	success	story	!
so	i	want	to	share	with	you	a	personal	story	about	a	 turn 	 around 	 	or	a	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	me	 be 	 cause 	 	in	1994	,	i	 pack 	 ed 	 	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 back 	 pack 	 	and	headed	off	for	a	year	of	travel	in	the	middle	of	my	university	 care 	 er 	 	.
you	should	have	 s 	 een 	 	my	 parent 	 s 	 	'	 re 	 action 	 	!
but	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	,	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	from	the	southern	part	of	africa	,	in	south	africa	--	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	north	,	in	egypt	.
and	i	 s 	 ought 	 	out	the	most	remote	 place 	 s 	 	.
i	went	to	the	siwa	 oa 	 sis 	 	.	that	was	one	of	my	 stop 	 s 	 	.
and	the	siwa	 oa 	 sis 	 	is	famous	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	the	key	thing	is	that	it	was	the	place	that	alexander	the	great	went	to	when	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	out	what	his	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	had	in	store	for	him	.
and	legend	 ha 	 s 	 	it	that	alexander	 trek 	 ked 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	desert	.
half	his	battalion	was	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	in	the	 sand 	 storm 	 	.
and	myth	 say 	 s 	 	that	he	had	an	audience	with	the	 or 	 acle 	 	,	and	it	 fore 	 told 	 	his	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	of	 great 	 ness 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	300	bc	.
so	africa	had	long	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	place	to	go	to	for	 answer 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	thing	i	remember	about	siwa	was	the	 magic 	 al 	 	view	of	the	sky	at	night	.
with	no	natural	light	source	,	siva	is	one	of	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 place 	 s 	 	that	when	you	look	up	you	see	a	perfect	 tape 	 stry 	 	.
fast	forward	to	2002	.
i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	cambridge	,	massachusetts	at	the	 health 	 care 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	.
and	i	see	the	same	picture	,	but	from	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	side	.
a	satellite	picture	looking	down	at	the	earth	.
and	it	was	that	picture	that	made	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	impact	on	me	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'll	never	forget	it	.	i	remember	the	 ver 	 y 	 	moment	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	that	image	with	you	of	what	i	saw	at	that	point	.
the	first	thing	that	i	saw	was	north	america	at	night	--	 glow 	 ing 	 	,	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	 glor 	 y 	 	.	a	warm	 feel 	 ing 	 	.	light	.
and	then	i	saw	it	--	africa	.	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	``	dark	continent	.	``
and	while	africa	may	be	dark	,	the	thing	that	 br 	 ought 	 	the	 mess 	 age 	 	home	to	me	was	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	we	are	facing	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	whilst	africa	may	be	dark	--	other	than	the	few	 s 	 peck 	 s 	 	that	exist	north	and	in	the	south	and	other	 area 	 s 	 	--	it	's	 a 	 glow 	 	with	the	light	in	the	 heart 	 s 	 	of	the	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	that	are	there	.
 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	dynamic	people	,	people	with	hope	.
it	was	george	kimble	,	the	 ge 	 ographer 	 	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	dark	about	africa	is	our	 ignor 	 ance 	 	of	it	.	``
so	let	's	start	 shed 	 d 	 ing 	 	light	on	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 eclec 	 tic 	 	continent	that	 ha 	 s 	 	so	much	to	 off 	 er 	 	.
let	's	start	 un 	 pack 	 ing 	 	it	.
africa	is	the	second	-	largest	continent	,	a	 land 	 mass 	 	second	from	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	is	the	second	most	 populate 	 d 	 	continent	,	with	900	million	people	.
in	fact	--	coming	back	to	the	land	mass	--	africa	is	so	big	that	you	could	fit	in	the	 continent 	 al 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 chin 	 a 	 	,	and	the	entire	europe	 in 	 to 	 	africa	,	and	still	have	space	.
africa	is	home	to	over	1,000	 language 	 s 	 	--	2,000	is	 an 	 other 	 	estimate	that	's	out	there	--	with	over	2,000	 language 	 s 	 	and	 dialect 	 s 	 	.
but	you	could	say	,	``	invest	in	africa	in	over	1,000	 language 	 s 	 	,	and	it	would	n't	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.	``
what	 do 	 es 	 	the	data	say	?
 a 	 s 	 	an	 invest 	 ment 	 	 bank 	 er 	 	,	i	'm	in	the	cross	-	flow	of	information	and	the	 change 	 s 	 	that	are	taking	place	in	capital	 market 	 s 	 	.
so	i	want	to	share	with	you	some	of	these	bellwether	 signal 	 s 	 	,	or	 sign 	 s 	 	,	and	 wind 	 s 	 	of	change	that	are	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	continent	.
so	let	's	start	on	that	.
and	let	's	start	at	the	high	level	,	on	the	macro	-	 factor 	 s 	 	.
 infla 	 tion 	 	,	in	general	,	is	coming	down	 a 	 cross 	 	africa	--	that	's	the	first	sign	--	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 reach 	 ing 	 	double	-	digit	 figure 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	start	looking	at	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
i	call	it	my	z.e.n	.	cluster	.
zambia	:	from	2004	to	2006	,	 move 	 s 	 	from	the	18	percent	in	 infla 	 tion 	 	to	the	nine	percent	.
egypt	:	from	the	16	percent	to	about	8.4	percent	.
from	the	16	percent	to	the	eight	percent	.	single	 digit 	 s 	 	.
more	 fasci 	 nating 	 	,	you	have	other	 count 	 ries 	 	--	south	africa	,	mauritius	,	namibia	--	all	in	single	 digit 	 s 	 	.
but	that	's	just	part	of	the	story	.	you	have	a	similar	trend	with	 curr 	 encies 	 	--	 curr 	 encies 	 	going	through	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	time	of	 st 	 ability 	 	.
but	that	's	looking	at	the	big	picture	.
and	the	first	myth	to	 dis 	 pel 	 	is	that	africa	is	not	a	country	.
it	's	made	up	--	it	's	made	up	of	53	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	the	 ver 	 y 	 	definition	--	to	say	``	invest	in	africa	``	is	a	no	-	go	.
it	's	 meaning 	 less 	 	.
each	country	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 un 	 ique 	 	value	 pro 	 position 	 	.
you	can	make	money	,	you	can	lose	money	in	africa	.
but	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	,	boy	oh	boy	,	they	exist	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 to 	 day 	 	is	about	--	it	's	about	 discuss 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
so	let	's	start	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 count 	 ries 	 	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	specific	material	and	data	.
i	was	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 elect 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	emeka	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	south	african	chamber	of	commerce	in	america	.
and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	and	happy	to	be	in	that	role	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	position	to	be	in	.
to	hear	 th 	 is 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	that	's	just	increasing	in	 ten 	 or 	 	and	 velo 	 city 	 	,	of	 decision 	 s 	 	about	trade	and	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 want 	 ing 	 	to	come	.
so	the	first	port	of	call	:	let	's	talk	a	little	bit	about	south	africa	.
but	not	the	south	africa	we	 al 	 ways 	 	talk	about	--	the	gold	,	the	 mineral 	 s 	 	,	the	first	world	 infra 	 structure 	 	--	a	bit	about	the	other	side	of	it	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	south	africa	was	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 vot 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	top	destination	for	the	top	1,000	uk	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	for	 off 	 shore 	 	call	-	 center 	 s 	 	.
same	language	,	 time 	 line 	 	,	et	 ce 	 tera 	 	.	 make 	 s 	 	sense	.
other	 head 	 lines 	 	that	have	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	south	africa	 we 	 re 	 	bain	capital	and	kkr	,	the	big	 boy 	 s 	 	of	private	 equ 	 ity 	 	.
 head 	 line 	 	in	south	africa	:	``	they	have	 land 	 ed 	 	.	``	 quit 	 e 	 	ominous	.
but	what	 we 	 re 	 	they	there	for	?	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	 asset 	 s 	 	.
bing	capital	's	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	of	edcon	,	a	large	 re 	 tail 	 er 	 	,	is	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	to	the	confidence	they	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	place	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	long	-	term	play	.
 be 	 ing 	 	a	 re 	 tail 	 er 	 	,	it	is	a	play	on	the	belief	that	 th 	 is 	 	middle	-	class	that	's	growing	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	grow	,	that	the	boom	and	the	confidence	in	consumer	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	.
but	the	story	of	africa	,	and	my	focus	,	is	beyond	south	africa	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	so	much	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 un 	 doubt 	 ed 	 ly 	 	,	nigeria	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	hot	spot	.
 challeng 	 es 	 	--	and	we	will	hear	a	lot	about	nigeria	in	these	four	 day 	 s 	 	.
but	looking	at	goldman	sachs	'	work	--	we	had	the	famous	bric	report	.
the	new	report	,	``	the	next	eleven	,	``	 high 	 light 	 s 	 	that	by	2020	nigeria	is	going	to	be	 among 	 st 	 	the	top	10	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	in	the	world	.
it	's	an	 invest 	 ment 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	think	about	that	.
is	 any 	 one 	 	--	our	 bank 	 s 	 	,	our	 invest 	 ors 	 	--	 serious 	 ly 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	going	to	nigeria	?
if	you	have	n't	,	why	not	?
what	's	going	on	in	nigeria	?	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	talk	about	it	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	capital	 market 	 s 	 	.
bellwether	 sign 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
guarantee	trust	bank	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 issue 	 d 	 	the	first	euro	bond	out	of	africa	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 exclude 	 s 	 	south	africa	.
but	the	first	eurobond	,	the	raising	of	 inter 	 national 	 	capital	 off 	 shore 	 	,	off	 it 	 s 	 	own	balance	sheet	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	sovereign	 back 	 ing 	 	--	that	is	an	 indic 	 ation 	 	of	the	confidence	that	is	taking	place	in	that	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	any	sovereign	 back 	 ing 	 	,	a	nigerian	company	raising	capital	 off 	 shore 	 	.
it	's	just	a	sign	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	come	.
looking	at	the	oil	industry	,	africa	 provide 	 s 	 	18	percent	of	the	u.s.	's	oil	supply	,	with	the	middle	east	just	16	percent	.
it	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 strat 	 egic 	 	partner	.
let	's	put	nigeria	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
2.2	to	2.4	million	 barrel 	 s 	 	of	oil	a	day	--	the	same	league	 a 	 s 	 	kuwait	,	the	same	league	 a 	 s 	 	venezuela	.
but	with	africa	,	let	's	start	 be 	 ing 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	emeka	and	i	have	had	these	 discuss 	 ions 	 	.
we	have	to	move	away	from	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	curse	of	the	 commodit 	 ies 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	about	oil	,	it	's	not	about	 commodit 	 ies 	 	.
for	africa	to	 tru 	 ly 	 	be	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	we	have	to	move	beyond	to	other	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
so	let	's	 un 	 pack 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	move	through	these	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 be 	 cause 	 	i	can	see	that	clock	 count 	 ing 	 	down	.
what	else	is	going	on	there	?	egypt	.
egypt	is	 launch 	 ing 	 	a	first	large	industrial	zone	--	2.8	billion	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
the	 announce 	 ment 	 	just	came	out	the	last	few	 week 	 s 	 	.
close	to	the	mediterranean	,	near	alexandria	--	 text 	 ile 	 s 	 	,	 petro 	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	by	a	singaporean	-	based	management	company	.
so	they	want	to	emerge	 a 	 s 	 	an	industrial	 power 	 house 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	--	away	from	oil	.
let	's	look	at	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.	let	's	look	at	 forest 	 ry 	 	.
what	's	going	on	there	?
in	tanzania	last	week	,	we	had	the	launch	of	the	east	african	 organ 	 ic 	 	produce	standard	.

they	're	going	to	be	 tap 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	carbon	 credit 	 s 	 	.
let	's	go	back	to	nigeria	.
the	 bank 	 ing 	 	sector	 ha 	 s 	 	 under 	 gone 	 	tremendous	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	from	over	80	 bank 	 s 	 	to	25	 bank 	 s 	 	.	 strength 	 en 	 ing 	 	of	the	system	.
but	what	's	going	on	there	?	 on 	 ly 	 	10	percent	of	the	country	is	 bank 	 ed 	 	.
the	largest	population	in	africa	is	in	nigeria	.
135	million	-	plus	people	.	think	about	that	.
there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	700	atms	in	the	country	.	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
the	same	for	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	.
now	let	's	look	at	the	continent	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	.
people	look	at	the	 road 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	and	they	'd	say	,	``	angola	:	90	percent	of	 road 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 tar 	 red 	 	.	ah	,	problem	!	``
it	's	more	expensive	to	transport	 good 	 s 	 	.	 price 	 s 	 	of	 good 	 s 	 	go	up	,	 infla 	 tion 	 	is	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
nigeria	:	70	percent	of	 road 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 tar 	 red 	 	.	zambia	:	80	percent	.
in	general	,	more	than	50	percent	of	 road 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 tar 	 red 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	!	energy	 need 	 s 	 	--	it	's	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
so	what	are	the	 sign 	 s 	 	that	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	changing	?
let	's	look	at	the	stock	 market 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
if	i	had	to	ask	you	,	``	in	2005	what	was	the	best	 perform 	 ing 	 	stock	market	or	stock	 ex 	 change 	 	in	the	world	?	``	would	egypt	come	to	mind	?
in	2005	,	the	egyptian	stock	 ex 	 change 	 	 return 	 ed 	 	over	145	percent	.
what	's	going	on	in	some	of	the	other	 count 	 ries 	 	?
let	's	look	at	some	2006	 number 	 s 	 	.	kenya	:	over	60	percent	.	nigeria	:	over	40	percent	.
south	africa	:	in	the	20	 percent 	 s 	 	.	high	 one 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	 trend 	 s 	 	that	are	taking	place	.
but	in	any	 invest 	 ment 	 	decision	,	the	key	question	is	,	``	what	is	my	 alter 	 native 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	in	africa	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	are	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	for	capital	.
and	global	capital	is	agnostic	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 loyal 	 ties 	 	.
there	's	an	 over 	 hang 	 	of	capital	in	the	u.s.	,	and	the	key	is	yield	 pick 	 up 	 	.
what	africa	is	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	is	a	 divers 	 ification 	 	play	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	yield	 pick 	 up 	 	for	the	 invest 	 or 	 	that	's	aware	of	what	he	or	she	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	when	looking	at	africa	vis	-	a	-	vis	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	 count 	 ries 	 	in	africa	vis	-	a	-	vis	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	there	,	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 count 	 ries 	 	that	 receiv 	 ed 	 	sovereign	 rating 	 s 	 	from	the	standard	&	poors	,	moody	's	and	fitch	's	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	16	african	 count 	 ries 	 	and	growing	have	sovereign	country	 rating 	 s 	 	.	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
take	nigeria	 aga 	 in 	 	:	double	b	-	minus	--	in	the	league	of	ukraine	and	 tur 	 key 	 	.	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	we	have	a	 compar 	 ison 	 	.
the	 back 	 bone 	 	of	making	 invest 	 ment 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	for	global	 holder 	 s 	 	of	capital	.
some	other	 figure 	 s 	 	.	south	africa	:	triple	b	-	plus	.	botswana	:	a	-	plus	.
bakino	faso	:	b	-	minus	.	and	so	on	.
in	fact	,	one	of	the	big	 age 	 ncies 	 	is	setting	up	an	 off 	 ice 	 	in	africa	.
why	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?	 be 	 cause 	 	they	expect	 invest 	 ment 	 	to	follow	.
so	one	of	the	big	 bellwether 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	my	final	 point 	 s 	 	i	want	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	,	is	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	i	read	is	that	cnbc	 ha 	 s 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	first	african	channel	.	why	is	cnbc	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
it	's	the	24	-	hour	 roll 	 ing 	 	african	news	channel	.
they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 expect 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	happen	.
me	and	you	,	the	 invest 	 ments 	 	we	are	going	to	be	making	,	the	 invest 	 ments 	 	the	world	is	going	to	be	making	--	that	's	the	24	-	hour	news	channel	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	africa	.
so	that	's	the	change	that	's	coming	down	the	 pipe 	 line 	 	.
so	in	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	i	want	to	turn	back	to	that	 ver 	 y 	 	slide	that	made	 s 	 uch 	 	a	deep	impact	on	me	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	[	i	'll	]	give	you	the	entire	picture	that	i	saw	in	2002	,	and	ask	you	that	when	you	think	about	what	your	role	can	be	in	africa	,	think	about	your	journey	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	light	to	 th 	 is 	 	continent	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
and	think	about	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	in	the	back	of	your	mind	 be 	 cause 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	can	be	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	 ra 	 ther 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
in	1899	,	joseph	conrad	released	``	the	heart	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	``	a	tale	of	grim	 horr 	 or 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	congo	river	.
if	one	 look 	 s 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	,	on	the	congo	river	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	bright	 light 	 s 	 	.	and	that	's	the	 ver 	 y 	 	congo	river	generating	light	--	the	old	heart	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	now	generating	light	with	hydro	-	electric	power	.
that	is	a	 transform 	 ation 	 	in	power	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	the	next	step	,	over	the	next	four	 day 	 s 	 	,	is	us	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	more	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	 per 	 chance 	 	,	if	you	can	 al 	 ways 	 	keep	 th 	 is 	 	picture	in	your	mind	,	that	when	we	 conven 	 e 	 	 may 	 be 	 	in	the	 di 	 stant 	 	future	,	in	2020	,	that	picture	will	look	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
thank	you	.
