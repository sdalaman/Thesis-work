i	've	 be 	 en 	 	at	mit	for	44	 year 	 s 	 	.	i	went	to	ted	i	.
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	other	person	here	,	i	think	,	who	did	that	.
all	the	other	teds	--	and	i	went	to	them	all	,	under	ricky	's	regime	--	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	what	the	media	lab	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	which	 to 	 day 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	500	people	in	it	.
and	if	you	read	the	press	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	last	week	 s 	 aid 	 	i	quit	the	media	lab	.
i	did	n't	quit	the	media	lab	;	i	 steppe 	 d 	 	down	 a 	 s 	 	 chair 	 man 	 	--	which	was	a	kind	of	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	title	,	but	 some 	 one 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	it	on	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	 a 	 s 	 	a	professor	,	is	you	stay	on	 a 	 s 	 	a	professor	.
and	i	will	now	do	for	the	rest	of	my	life	the	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	,	which	i	've	sort	of	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	for	a	year	and	a	half	,	 any 	 way 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	use	my	18	 minute 	 s 	 	to	tell	you	why	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	how	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	then	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	at	some	point	i	'll	even	pass	around	what	the	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 	might	be	like	.
now	,	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	chris	to	talk	about	some	of	the	big	 issue 	 s 	 	,	and	so	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	i	'd	start	with	the	three	that	at	 l 	 east 	 	drove	me	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	first	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	obvious	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	when	you	meet	a	head	of	state	,	and	you	say	,	``	what	is	your	most	precious	natural	resource	?	``
they	will	not	say	children	at	first	,	and	then	when	you	say	,	``	children	,	``	they	will	 pre 	 tty 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	agree	with	you	.
and	so	that	is	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
 every 	 body 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	that	 what 	 ever 	 	the	 solution 	 s 	 	are	to	the	big	 problem 	 s 	 	,	they	include	education	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	can	be	just	education	,	and	can	never	be	 with 	 out 	 	some	element	of	education	.
so	that	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	part	of	it	.
and	the	third	is	a	little	bit	less	obvious	.
and	that	is	that	we	all	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	walk	,	how	to	talk	,	not	by	 be 	 ing 	 	taught	how	to	talk	,	or	taught	how	to	walk	,	but	by	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	the	world	,	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	certain	 result 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	ask	for	 some 	 thing 	 	,	or	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	stand	up	and	reach	it	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	at	about	the	age	six	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	told	to	stop	 learn 	 ing 	 	that	way	,	and	that	all	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	then	on	would	happen	through	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	people	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	,	like	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	now	,	or	a	book	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	through	 teach 	 ing 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	in	general	that	 computer 	 s 	 	have	 provide 	 d 	 	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	that	it	now	 include 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	which	is	a	little	bit	more	like	 walk 	 ing 	 	and	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	in	the	sense	that	a	lot	of	it	's	driven	by	the	 learn 	 er 	 	 him 	 self 	 	or	 her 	 self 	 	.
so	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 principle 	 s 	 	--	some	of	you	may	know	seymour	papert	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	back	in	1982	,	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	senegal	.
 be 	 cause 	 	some	people	think	that	the	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	a	year	ago	,	or	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	or	we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	by	 light 	 ning 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	back	a	long	time	,	and	in	fact	,	back	to	the	'60s	.
here	we	're	in	the	'80s	.
steve	 job 	 s 	 	had	 give 	 n 	 	us	some	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	;	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	senegal	.
it	did	n't	scale	but	it	at	 l 	 east 	 	was	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	to	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	that	these	 kid 	 s 	 	--	even	 th 	 ough 	 	english	was	n't	 the 	 ir 	 	language	,	the	latin	 alpha 	 bet 	 	 bare 	 ly 	 	was	 the 	 ir 	 	language	,	but	they	could	just	swim	like	fish	;	they	could	play	these	like	 piano 	 s 	 	.
a	little	bit	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	i	got	 involve 	 d 	 	 personal 	 ly 	 	.
and	these	are	two	 anecdote 	 s 	 	--	one	was	in	cambodia	,	in	a	village	that	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	no	water	,	no	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	no	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	 broad 	 band 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	now	.
and	these	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	first	english	word	is	``	google	,	``	and	they	 on 	 ly 	 	know	skype	.	they	've	never	heard	of	 tele 	 phony 	 	.
ok	,	they	just	use	skype	.
and	they	go	home	at	night	;	they	've	got	a	 broad 	 band 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	in	a	hut	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
the	 parent 	 s 	 	love	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	they	open	up	the	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	 bright 	 est 	 	light	source	in	the	house	.
and	talk	about	where	 metaphor 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 ality 	 	mix	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	actual	school	.
in	parallel	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	seymour	papert	got	the	 govern 	 or 	 	of	maine	to	 legisl 	 ate 	 	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	in	the	year	2002	.
now	at	the	time	,	i	think	it	's	fair	to	say	that	80	percent	of	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	--	let	me	say	,	 apprehens 	 ive 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	against	it	.
and	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 prefer 	 red 	 	that	the	money	would	be	used	for	 high 	 er 	 	 s 	 al 	 aries 	 	,	more	 school 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	now	,	three	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	guess	what	?
they	're	 report 	 ing 	 	five	 thing 	 s 	 	:	drop	of	 tru 	 ancy 	 	to	 al 	 most 	 	zero	;	 attend 	 ing 	 	parent	-	teacher	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	which	 no 	 body 	 	did	and	now	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 do 	 es 	 	--	drop	in	discipline	 problem 	 s 	 	;	 in 	 crease 	 	in	student	 particip 	 ation 	 	--	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	now	 say 	 ing 	 	it	's	kind	of	 f 	 un 	 	to	teach	;	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 engag 	 ed 	 	--	they	have	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	!	--	and	then	the	fifth	,	which	 interest 	 s 	 	me	the	most	,	is	that	the	 serv 	 ers 	 	have	to	be	 turn 	 ed 	 	off	at	certain	 time 	 s 	 	at	night	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	just	 get 	 ting 	 	too	much	email	from	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	them	for	help	.
so	when	you	see	that	kind	of	thing	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	have	to	test	.
the	 day 	 s 	 	of	pilot	 project 	 s 	 	are	over	,	when	people	say	,	``	well	,	we	'd	like	to	do	three	or	four	thousand	in	our	country	to	see	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.	``
screw	you	.	go	to	the	back	of	the	line	and	 some 	 one 	 	else	will	do	it	,	and	then	when	you	figure	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	you	can	join	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	was	 form 	 ed 	 	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	.
it	's	a	 non 	 profit 	 	 associ 	 ation 	 	;	it	raised	about	20	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	do	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	to	just	get	 th 	 is 	 	built	,	and	then	have	it	 produce 	 d 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
scale	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	it	's	not	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	buy	 component 	 s 	 	at	a	lower	price	,	ok	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	go	to	a	 manufactur 	 er 	 	--	and	i	will	 leav 	 e 	 	the	name	out	--	but	we	 want 	 ed 	 	a	small	 dis 	 play 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	have	perfect	color	 uniform 	 ity 	 	;	it	can	even	have	a	pixel	or	two	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	that	bright	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 manufactur 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	we	're	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	that	.	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	living	room	.
we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	perfect	color	 uniform 	 ity 	 	.
we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	big	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	,	bright	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	.
you	're	not	part	of	our	 strat 	 egic 	 	plan	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	that	's	kind	of	too	bad	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	need	100	million	 unit 	 s 	 	a	year	.	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	well	 may 	 be 	 	we	could	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	your	 strat 	 egic 	 	plan	.	``
and	that	's	why	scale	 count 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	why	we	will	not	launch	 th 	 is 	 	 with 	 out 	 	five	to	10	million	 unit 	 s 	 	in	the	first	run	.
and	the	idea	is	to	launch	with	 en 	 ough 	 	scale	that	the	scale	 it 	 self 	 	 help 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	the	price	down	,	and	that	's	why	i	 s 	 aid 	 	seven	to	10	million	there	.
and	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 with 	 out 	 	a	 sale 	 s 	 	and	 market 	 ing 	 	team	.
i	mean	,	you	're	looking	at	the	 sale 	 s 	 	and	 market 	 ing 	 	team	.
we	will	do	it	by	going	to	seven	large	 count 	 ries 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	them	to	agree	and	launch	it	,	and	then	the	 other 	 s 	 	can	follow	.
we	have	 partner 	 s 	 	;	it	's	not	hard	to	guess	google	would	be	one	;	the	 other 	 s 	 	are	all	 play 	 ing 	 	to	 pend 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	press	a	great	deal	.
it	's	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	green	machine	that	we	 introduc 	 ed 	 	with	kofi	annan	in	november	at	the	world	 summ 	 it 	 	that	was	held	in	tunisia	.
now	once	people	start	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	say	,	ah	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 lap 	 top 	 	project	.
well	,	no	,	it	's	not	a	 lap 	 top 	 	project	.	it	's	an	education	project	.
and	the	 f 	 un 	 	part	--	and	i	'm	 quit 	 e 	 	focused	on	it	--	i	tell	people	i	used	to	be	a	light	bulb	,	but	now	i	'm	a	laser	--	i	'm	just	going	to	get	that	thing	built	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	not	so	hard	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	are	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	:	i	say	50	percent	here	;	it	's	more	like	60	,	60	percent	of	the	cost	of	your	 lap 	 top 	 	is	 sale 	 s 	 	,	 market 	 ing 	 	,	 distribut 	 ion 	 	and	profit	.
now	we	have	 non 	 e 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	ok	?
 non 	 e 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	figure	 in 	 to 	 	our	cost	,	 be 	 cause 	 	first	of	all	,	we	sell	it	at	cost	,	and	the	 government 	 s 	 	 distribut 	 e 	 	it	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	to	the	school	system	like	a	 text 	 book 	 	.
so	that	piece	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	have	 dis 	 play 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
now	the	 dis 	 play 	 	on	your	 lap 	 top 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	,	in	rough	 number 	 s 	 	,	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	diagonal	inch	.
now	that	can	drop	to	eight	;	it	can	drop	to	seven	;	but	it	's	not	going	to	drop	to	two	,	or	to	one	and	a	half	,	 un 	 less 	 	we	do	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	clever	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	rest	--	that	little	 brow 	 n 	 	box	--	that	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	rest	of	your	 lap 	 top 	 	is	 devote 	 d 	 	to	 it 	 self 	 	.
it	's	a	little	bit	like	an	 obes 	 e 	 	person	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	use	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	to	move	 the 	 ir 	 	 obes 	 ity 	 	.	ok	?
and	we	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	 to 	 day 	 	which	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.
ok	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	using	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	since	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 ception 	 	.
and	my	 lap 	 top 	 	 run 	 s 	 	 s 	 lower 	 	,	less	 reli 	 ably 	 	and	less	 pleas 	 ant 	 ly 	 	than	it	ever	 ha 	 s 	 	before	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	year	is	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
now	people	clap	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	even	get	 stand 	 ing 	 	 ov 	 ations 	 	and	i	say	,	``	what	the	hell	's	wrong	with	you	?	why	are	we	all	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	?	``
and	 some 	 body 	 	--	to	remain	 name 	 less 	 	--	 call 	 ed 	 	our	 lap 	 top 	 	a	``	gadget	``	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	god	,	our	 lap 	 top 	 	's	going	to	go	like	a	bat	out	of	hell	.
when	you	open	it	up	,	it	's	going	to	go	``	bing	;	``	it	'll	be	on	;	it	'll	use	it	;	it	'll	be	just	like	it	was	in	1985	,	when	you	 b 	 ought 	 	an	apple	macintosh	512	.
it	 work 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	going	 stead 	 ily 	 	 down 	 hill 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	people	ask	all	the	time	what	it	is	.
that	's	what	it	is	.
the	two	 piece 	 s 	 	that	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	 not 	 able 	 	is	it	'll	be	a	mesh	network	,	so	when	the	 kid 	 s 	 	open	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	,	they	all	 be 	 come 	 	a	network	,	and	then	just	need	one	or	two	 point 	 s 	 	of	 back 	 haul 	 	.
you	can	serve	a	couple	of	thousand	 kid 	 s 	 	with	two	 mega 	 bits 	 	.
so	you	 re 	 ally 	 	can	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	village	,	and	then	the	 village 	 s 	 	can	connect	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	you	 re 	 ally 	 	can	do	it	 quit 	 e 	 	well	.
the	dual	mode	 dis 	 play 	 	--	the	idea	is	to	have	a	 dis 	 play 	 	that	both	 work 	 s 	 	 out 	 door 	 s 	 	--	is	n't	it	 f 	 un 	 	using	your	cell	phone	 out 	 door 	 s 	 	in	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	?
well	,	you	ca	n't	see	it	.
and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	see	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 back 	 light 	 ing 	 	most	of	the	time	,	most	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	.
now	,	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	one	that	will	be	both	 front 	 lit 	 	and	 back 	 lit 	 	.
and	 whet 	 her 	 	you	 manual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 witch 	 	it	or	you	do	it	in	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	is	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	.
but	when	it	's	 back 	 lit 	 	,	it	's	color	;	and	when	it	's	 front 	 lit 	 	,	it	's	black	and	white	at	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	 re 	 solution 	 	.
is	it	all	 work 	 ed 	 	out	?	no	.
that	's	why	a	lot	of	our	people	are	more	or	less	living	in	taiwan	right	now	.
and	in	about	30	 day 	 s 	 	we	'll	know	for	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	piece	there	is	that	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	can	do	the	maintenance	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 aga 	 in 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	people	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	,	but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	true	.
that	's	the	machine	we	 show 	 ed 	 	in	tunis	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	more	the	direction	that	we	're	going	to	go	.
and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	did	n't	think	was	possible	.
now	,	i	'm	going	to	pass	 th 	 is 	 	around	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	a	design	,	ok	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	sort	of	 embodi 	 ment 	 	of	it	for	you	to	play	with	.
and	it	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	just	a	model	.
the	 work 	 ing 	 	one	is	at	mit	.
i	'm	going	to	pass	it	to	 th 	 is 	 	 hand 	 some 	 	 gentle 	 man 	 	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	you	can	then	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	left	or	--	oh	,	 simul 	 cast 	 	.	sorry	!	i	 for 	 got 	 	.	i	 for 	 got 	 	.	ok	,	so	 where 	 ver 	 	the	camera	is	--	ok	,	good	point	.	thank	you	,	chris	.
the	idea	was	that	it	would	be	not	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 lap 	 top 	 	,	but	that	it	could	transform	and	be	 in 	 to 	 	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	book	.
so	it	's	sort	of	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	book	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	when	you	go	 out 	 side 	 	,	it	's	in	black	and	white	.
the	 game 	 s 	 	 button 	 s 	 	are	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	'll	 al 	 so 	 	be	a	 game 	 s 	 	machine	,	book	machine	.
set	it	up	 th 	 is 	 	way	and	it	's	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	set	.
etc	.	,	etc	.	--	is	that	 en 	 ough 	 	for	 simul 	 cast 	 	?	ok	,	sorry	.
i	'll	let	jim	decide	which	way	to	 s 	 end 	 	it	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.	ok	.
seven	 count 	 ries 	 	.
i	say	``	 may 	 be 	 	``	for	massachusetts	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	do	a	bid	.
by	law	you	've	got	to	bid	,	and	so	on	and	so	forth	.
so	i	ca	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	name	them	.
in	the	other	 case 	 s 	 	,	they	do	n't	have	to	do	 bid 	 s 	 	.	they	can	decide	.
it	's	the	federal	government	in	each	case	.
it	's	kind	of	 agon 	 izing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	lot	of	people	say	,	``	well	,	let	's	do	it	at	the	state	level	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	 state 	 s 	 	are	more	nimble	than	the	 fed 	 s 	 	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	yet	we	count	.
we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	federal	government	;	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 mini 	 s 	 tries 	 	of	education	.
and	if	you	look	at	 government 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	 mini 	 s 	 tries 	 	of	education	tend	to	be	the	most	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	have	huge	 pay 	 roll 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	they	know	about	education	,	a	lot	of	culture	is	built	 in 	 to 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	.	and	so	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	hard	road	.
if	you	look	at	the	 count 	 ries 	 	,	they	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	 geo 	 cultural 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	.
have	they	all	 agree 	 d 	 	?	no	,	not	 complete 	 ly 	 	;	 prob 	 ably 	 	thailand	,	brazil	and	nigeria	are	the	three	that	are	the	most	active	,	and	most	 agree 	 d 	 	.
we	're	 purpose 	 ly 	 	not	 sign 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	with	 any 	 body 	 	 un 	 til 	 	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	the	 work 	 ing 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	since	i	visit	each	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 with 	 in 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	every	three	 month 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	just	going	around	the	world	every	three	 week 	 s 	 	.
here	's	sort	of	the	schedule	,	and	i	put	at	the	bottom	we	might	give	some	away	free	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	a	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 	;	you	ca	n't	do	it	.
well	,	guess	what	,	we	're	not	.
we	're	coming	in	 prob 	 ably 	 	at	135	,	to	start	,	then	drift	down	.
and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	hit	the	market	at	a	price	and	then	drift	up	.
it	's	kind	of	the	loss	 lead 	 er 	 	,	and	then	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	it	ca	n't	be	 afford 	 ed 	 	,	or	it	ca	n't	be	 scale 	 d 	 	out	.
so	we	're	 target 	 ing 	 	50	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	2010	.
the	gray	market	's	a	big	issue	.	and	one	of	the	ways	--	just	one	--	but	one	of	the	ways	to	help	in	the	case	of	the	gray	market	is	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	so	 utter 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
it	's	a	little	bit	like	the	fact	that	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	--	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	are	 stole 	 n 	 	every	day	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	;	not	one	single	post	 off 	 ice 	 	truck	is	 stole 	 n 	 	.	ok	.	and	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	market	for	post	 off 	 ice 	 	 truck 	 s 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	post	 off 	 ice 	 	truck	.
you	can	spray	paint	it	;	you	can	do	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	.
i	just	 learn 	 ed 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	:	in	south	africa	,	no	white	volvos	are	 stole 	 n 	 	.
period	.	 non 	 e 	 	.	zero	.
so	we	want	to	make	it	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	a	white	volvo	.
each	government	 ha 	 s 	 	a	task	force	.	 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	is	less	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	 government 	 s 	 	to	all	work	together	,	and	it	's	not	easy	.
the	 economic 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	start	with	the	federal	 government 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 lat 	 er 	 	to	go	to	other	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	child	-	to	-	child	 fund 	 ing 	 	,	so	a	child	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	 buy 	 s 	 	one	for	a	child	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	 may 	 be 	 	of	the	same	gender	,	 may 	 be 	 	of	the	same	age	.
an	uncle	 give 	 s 	 	a	niece	or	a	nephew	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	 birth 	 day 	 	present	.
i	mean	,	there	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	will	happen	,	and	they	'll	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	--	i	say	--	it	's	an	education	project	.
are	we	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	?
the	answer	is	,	the	system	 certain 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	but	no	,	we	're	not	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	the	education	content	.
that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	we	are	 certain 	 ly 	 	 construction 	 ists 	 	.
and	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 learn 	 ing 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	from	logo	,	which	was	 start 	 ed 	 	in	1968	,	to	more	modern	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	scratch	,	if	you	've	ever	even	heard	of	it	,	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	part	of	it	.
and	that	's	the	 roll 	 out 	 	.
are	we	 dream 	 ing 	 	?	is	 th 	 is 	 	real	?	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	real	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 critic 	 ism 	 	,	and	people	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	want	to	 critic 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	a	 human 	 itarian 	 	effort	;	it	is	a	 non 	 profit 	 	effort	;	and	to	 critic 	 ize 	 	it	is	a	little	bit	stupid	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
but	the	one	thing	that	people	could	 critic 	 ize 	 	was	,	great	idea	,	but	these	 guy 	 s 	 	ca	n't	do	it	.
and	that	could	either	mean	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	 professor 	 s 	 	and	so	on	could	n't	do	it	,	or	that	it	's	not	possible	.
well	,	on	december	12	,	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	quanta	 agree 	 d 	 	to	build	it	,	and	since	they	make	about	one	-	third	of	all	the	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	question	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
so	it	's	not	a	matter	of	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	going	to	happen	.	it	is	going	to	happen	.
and	if	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	at	138	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	so	what	?
if	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	six	 month 	 s 	 	late	,	so	what	?
that	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	soft	 land 	 ing 	 	.	thank	you	.
