 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	the	problem	of	other	 mind 	 s 	 	.
and	the	problem	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	not	the	familiar	one	from	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	which	is	,	``	how	can	we	know	 whet 	 her 	 	other	people	have	 mind 	 s 	 	?	``
that	is	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	have	a	mind	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	else	is	just	a	 re 	 ally 	 	convincing	robot	.
so	that	's	a	problem	in	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	but	for	 to 	 day 	 	's	 purpose 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	 assum 	 e 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	have	a	mind	,	and	that	i	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	is	a	second	problem	that	is	 may 	 be 	 	even	more	familiar	to	us	 a 	 s 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 spouse 	 s 	 	and	 novel 	 ists 	 	,	which	is	,	``	why	is	it	so	hard	to	know	what	 some 	 body 	 	else	 want 	 s 	 	or	 believ 	 es 	 	?	``
or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	more	 relevant 	 ly 	 	,	``	why	is	it	so	hard	to	change	what	 some 	 body 	 	else	 want 	 s 	 	or	 believ 	 es 	 	?	``
i	think	 novel 	 ists 	 	put	 th 	 is 	 	best	.
like	philip	roth	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	yet	,	what	are	we	to	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ibly 	 	significant	business	of	other	people	?
so	ill	 equi 	 pped 	 	are	we	all	,	to	envision	one	 an 	 other 	 	's	 in 	 terior 	 	 work 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 visible 	 	 aim 	 s 	 	.	``
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	teacher	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	spouse	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	a	problem	i	confront	every	day	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	a	different	problem	of	other	 mind 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	the	one	i	'm	going	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	that	problem	is	,	``	how	is	it	so	easy	to	know	other	 mind 	 s 	 	?	``
so	to	start	with	an	 illustr 	 ation 	 	,	you	need	 al 	 most 	 	no	information	,	one	 snap 	 shot 	 	of	a	 strange 	 r 	 	,	to	guess	what	 th 	 is 	 	woman	is	 think 	 ing 	 	,	or	what	 th 	 is 	 	man	is	.
and	put	 an 	 other 	 	way	,	the	crux	of	the	problem	is	the	machine	that	we	use	for	 think 	 ing 	 	about	other	 mind 	 s 	 	,	our	brain	,	is	made	up	of	 piece 	 s 	 	,	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	,	that	we	share	with	all	other	 animal 	 s 	 	,	with	 monkey 	 s 	 	and	 mic 	 e 	 	and	even	sea	 slug 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	you	put	them	together	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	network	,	and	what	you	get	is	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	write	romeo	and	juliet	.
or	to	say	,	 a 	 s 	 	alan	greenspan	did	,	``	i	know	you	think	you	understand	what	you	thought	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	but	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	what	you	heard	is	not	what	i	 me 	 ant 	 	.	``
so	,	the	job	of	my	field	of	cognitive	 neuro 	 science 	 	is	to	stand	with	these	 idea 	 s 	 	,	one	in	each	hand	.
and	to	try	to	understand	how	you	can	put	together	simple	 unit 	 s 	 	,	simple	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	over	space	and	time	,	in	a	network	,	and	get	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	human	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	think	about	 mind 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	three	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	whole	project	here	is	huge	.
and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	just	our	first	few	 step 	 s 	 	about	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	a	special	brain	region	for	 think 	 ing 	 	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
some	 observ 	 ations 	 	on	the	 s 	 low 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	 a 	 s 	 	we	learn	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	difficult	job	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	to	show	that	some	of	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	people	,	in	how	we	 judg 	 e 	 	 other 	 s 	 	,	can	be	 explain 	 ed 	 	by	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	system	.
so	first	,	the	first	thing	i	want	to	tell	you	is	that	there	is	a	brain	region	in	the	human	brain	,	in	your	 brain 	 s 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	job	it	is	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	it	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	right	temporo	-	 par 	 ietal 	 	junction	.
it	's	above	and	 be 	 hind 	 	your	right	ear	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	brain	region	you	used	when	you	saw	the	 picture 	 s 	 	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	or	when	you	read	romeo	and	juliet	or	when	you	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	alan	greenspan	.
and	you	do	n't	use	it	for	solving	any	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	logical	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	right	tpj	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 show 	 s 	 	the	average	 activ 	 ation 	 	in	a	group	of	what	we	call	typical	human	 adult 	 s 	 	.
they	're	mit	 under 	 graduate 	 s 	 	.
the	second	thing	i	want	to	say	about	 th 	 is 	 	brain	system	is	that	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	human	 adult 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	 understand 	 ing 	 	other	 mind 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	that	way	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	children	a	long	time	to	break	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	little	bit	of	that	long	,	 extend 	 ed 	 	process	.
the	first	thing	i	'm	going	to	show	you	is	a	change	between	age	three	and	five	,	 a 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	learn	to	understand	that	 some 	 body 	 	else	can	have	 belief 	 s 	 	that	are	different	from	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	five	-	year	-	old	who	is	 get 	 ting 	 	a	standard	kind	of	 puzzl 	 e 	 	that	we	call	the	false	belief	task	.
rebecca	saxe	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	pirate	.	his	name	is	ivan	.
and	you	know	what	 pirate 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	like	?
child	:	what	?	rs	:	 pirate 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	like	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
child	:	cheese	?	i	love	cheese	!
rs	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	so	ivan	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cheese	sandwich	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	!
i	 re 	 ally 	 	love	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.	``
and	ivan	 put 	 s 	 	his	sandwich	over	here	,	on	top	of	the	pirate	chest	.
and	ivan	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	know	what	?	i	need	a	drink	with	my	lunch	.	``
and	so	ivan	 go 	 es 	 	to	get	a	drink	.
and	while	ivan	is	away	the	wind	 come 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 blow 	 s 	 	the	sandwich	down	onto	the	grass	.
and	now	,	here	 come 	 s 	 	the	other	pirate	.
 th 	 is 	 	pirate	is	 call 	 ed 	 	joshua	.
and	joshua	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 s 	 	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
so	joshua	 ha 	 s 	 	a	cheese	sandwich	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	!	i	love	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.	``
and	he	 put 	 s 	 	his	cheese	sandwich	over	here	on	top	of	the	pirate	chest	.
child	:	so	,	that	one	is	his	.
rs	:	that	one	is	joshua	's	.	that	's	right	.
child	:	and	then	his	went	on	the	ground	.
rs	:	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	right	.
child	:	so	he	wo	n't	know	which	one	is	his	.
rs	:	oh	.	so	now	joshua	 go 	 es 	 	off	to	get	a	drink	.
ivan	 come 	 s 	 	back	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	want	my	cheese	sandwich	.	``
so	which	one	do	you	think	ivan	is	going	to	take	?
child	:	i	think	he	is	going	to	take	that	one	.
rs	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	think	he	's	going	to	take	that	one	?	all	right	.	let	's	see	.
oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	right	.	he	took	that	one	.
so	that	's	a	five	-	year	-	old	who	 clear 	 ly 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	that	other	people	can	have	false	 belief 	 s 	 	and	what	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	are	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 action 	 s 	 	.
now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	three	-	year	-	old	who	got	the	same	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
rs	:	and	ivan	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	want	my	cheese	sandwich	.	``
which	sandwich	is	he	going	to	take	?
do	you	think	he	's	going	to	take	that	one	?	let	's	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
let	's	see	what	he	 do 	 es 	 	.	here	 come 	 s 	 	ivan	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	want	my	cheese	sandwich	.	``
and	he	 take 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
uh	-	oh	.	why	did	he	take	that	one	?
child	:	his	was	on	the	grass	.
so	the	three	-	year	-	old	 do 	 es 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
first	,	he	 predict 	 s 	 	ivan	will	take	the	sandwich	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	his	.
and	second	,	when	he	 s 	 ees 	 	ivan	taking	the	sandwich	where	he	left	his	,	where	we	would	say	he	's	taking	that	one	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 think 	 s 	 	it	's	his	,	the	three	-	year	-	old	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	 an 	 other 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	:	he	's	not	taking	his	own	sandwich	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	it	's	 dirt 	 y 	 	,	on	the	ground	.
so	that	's	why	he	's	taking	the	other	sandwich	.
now	of	course	,	 develop 	 ment 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	end	at	five	.
and	we	can	see	the	 continu 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	process	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	by	 up 	 ping 	 	the	 ant 	 e 	 	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	children	now	,	not	for	an	action	 predict 	 ion 	 	,	but	for	a	moral	judgment	.
so	first	i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	three	-	year	-	old	 aga 	 in 	 	.
rs	.	:	so	is	ivan	 be 	 ing 	 	mean	and	 naught 	 y 	 	for	taking	joshua	's	sandwich	?
child	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
rs	:	should	ivan	get	in	trouble	for	taking	joshua	's	sandwich	?
child	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
so	it	's	 may 	 be 	 	not	surprising	he	 think 	 s 	 	it	was	mean	of	ivan	to	take	joshua	's	sandwich	,	since	he	 think 	 s 	 	ivan	 on 	 ly 	 	took	joshua	's	sandwich	to	avoid	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	eat	his	own	 dirt 	 y 	 	sandwich	.
but	now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	five	-	year	-	old	.
remember	the	five	-	year	-	old	 complete 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	why	ivan	took	joshua	's	sandwich	.
rs	:	was	ivan	 be 	 ing 	 	mean	and	 naught 	 y 	 	for	taking	joshua	's	sandwich	?
child	:	um	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
and	so	,	it	is	not	 un 	 til 	 	age	seven	that	we	get	what	 look 	 s 	 	more	like	an	adult	 respons 	 e 	 	.
rs	:	should	ivan	get	in	trouble	for	taking	joshua	's	sandwich	?
child	:	no	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	wind	should	get	in	trouble	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	the	wind	should	get	in	trouble	for	 s 	 witch 	 ing 	 	the	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
and	now	what	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	in	my	lab	is	to	put	children	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	scanner	and	ask	what	's	going	on	in	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 a 	 s 	 	they	develop	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
so	the	first	thing	is	that	in	children	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	same	brain	region	,	the	right	tpj	,	 be 	 ing 	 	used	while	children	are	 think 	 ing 	 	about	other	people	.
but	it	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	like	the	adult	brain	.
so	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	 adult 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	told	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	is	 al 	 most 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 special 	 ized 	 	--	it	 do 	 es 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 think 	 ing 	 	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	--	in	children	it	's	much	less	so	,	when	they	are	age	five	to	eight	,	the	age	range	of	the	children	i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	if	we	even	look	at	eight	to	11	-	year	-	olds	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	early	adolescence	,	they	still	do	n't	have	 quit 	 e 	 	an	adult	-	like	brain	region	.
and	so	,	what	we	can	see	is	that	over	the	course	of	 child 	 hood 	 	and	even	 in 	 to 	 	adolescence	,	both	the	cognitive	system	,	our	mind	's	ability	to	think	about	other	 mind 	 s 	 	,	and	the	brain	system	that	 support 	 s 	 	it	are	 continu 	 ing 	 	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	to	develop	.
but	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	aware	,	even	in	 adult 	 hood 	 	,	people	differ	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	in	how	good	they	are	at	 think 	 ing 	 	of	other	 mind 	 s 	 	,	how	often	they	do	it	and	how	 accurate 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	was	,	could	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	among	 adult 	 s 	 	in	how	they	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	be	 explain 	 ed 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	?
so	,	the	first	thing	that	we	did	is	we	 g 	 ave 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	a	version	of	the	pirate	problem	that	we	 g 	 ave 	 	to	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	give	that	to	you	now	.
so	grace	and	her	friend	are	on	a	tour	of	a	chemical	 factor 	 y 	 	,	and	they	take	a	break	for	coffee	.
and	grace	's	friend	 ask 	 s 	 	for	some	sugar	in	her	coffee	.
grace	 go 	 es 	 	to	make	the	coffee	and	 find 	 s 	 	by	the	coffee	a	pot	 contain 	 ing 	 	a	white	powder	,	which	is	sugar	.
but	the	powder	is	 label 	 ed 	 	``	 dead 	 ly 	 	poison	,	``	so	grace	 think 	 s 	 	that	the	powder	is	a	 dead 	 ly 	 	poison	.
and	she	 put 	 s 	 	it	in	her	friend	's	coffee	.
and	her	friend	 drink 	 s 	 	the	coffee	,	and	is	fine	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	it	was	 moral 	 ly 	 	 per 	 mis 	 s 	 ible 	 	for	grace	to	put	the	powder	in	the	coffee	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	good	.
so	we	ask	people	,	how	much	should	grace	be	 blame 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	which	we	call	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	attempt	to	harm	?
and	we	can	 compar 	 e 	 	that	to	 an 	 other 	 	case	,	where	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	real	world	is	the	same	.
the	powder	is	still	sugar	,	but	what	's	different	is	what	grace	 think 	 s 	 	.
now	she	 think 	 s 	 	the	powder	is	sugar	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 un 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	if	grace	 think 	 s 	 	the	powder	is	sugar	and	 put 	 s 	 	it	in	her	friend	's	coffee	,	people	say	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	no	blame	at	all	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	if	she	 think 	 s 	 	the	powder	was	poison	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	sugar	,	now	people	say	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	blame	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	real	world	was	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
and	in	fact	,	they	say	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	more	blame	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	 fail 	 ed 	 	attempt	to	harm	,	than	in	 an 	 other 	 	case	,	which	we	call	an	accident	.
where	grace	thought	the	powder	was	sugar	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 label 	 ed 	 	``	sugar	``	and	by	the	coffee	machine	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	powder	was	poison	.
so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	when	the	powder	was	poison	,	the	friend	 d 	 rank 	 	the	coffee	and	 di 	 ed 	 	,	people	say	grace	 deserve 	 s 	 	less	blame	in	that	case	,	when	she	 innoc 	 ent 	 ly 	 	thought	it	was	sugar	,	than	in	the	other	case	,	where	she	thought	it	was	poison	and	no	harm	 occur 	 red 	 	.
people	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	disagree	a	little	bit	about	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	much	blame	grace	should	get	in	the	accident	case	.
some	people	think	she	should	deserve	more	blame	,	and	other	people	less	.
and	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	we	look	 in 	 side 	 	the	 brain 	 s 	 	of	people	while	they	're	making	that	judgment	.
so	what	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	,	from	left	to	right	,	is	how	much	activity	there	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	,	and	from	top	to	bottom	,	how	much	blame	people	 s 	 aid 	 	that	grace	 deserve 	 d 	 	.
and	what	you	can	see	is	,	on	the	left	when	there	was	 ver 	 y 	 	little	activity	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	,	people	paid	little	attention	to	her	 innoc 	 ent 	 	belief	and	 s 	 aid 	 	she	 deserve 	 d 	 	a	lot	of	blame	for	the	accident	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	on	the	right	,	where	there	was	a	lot	of	activity	,	people	paid	a	lot	more	attention	to	her	 innoc 	 ent 	 	belief	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	she	 deserve 	 d 	 	a	lot	less	blame	for	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	accident	.
so	that	's	good	,	but	of	course	what	we	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	is	have	a	way	to	interfere	with	function	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	,	and	see	if	we	could	change	people	's	moral	judgment	.
and	we	do	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	tool	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	trans	-	cranial	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 stimul 	 ation 	 	,	or	tms	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tool	that	lets	us	pass	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	through	 some 	 body 	 	's	skull	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	small	region	of	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	,	and	 tempor 	 arily 	 	 dis 	 organize 	 	the	function	of	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	that	region	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	demo	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
first	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	put	a	quarter	on	the	machine	.
when	you	hear	 click 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	machine	on	.
so	now	i	'm	going	to	 app 	 ly 	 	that	same	 puls 	 e 	 	to	my	brain	,	to	the	part	of	my	brain	that	 control 	 s 	 	my	hand	.
so	there	is	no	physical	force	,	just	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	.
woman	:	ready	,	rebecca	?	rs	:	 y 	 es 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	it	 cause 	 s 	 	a	small	 in 	 voluntary 	 	 contract 	 ion 	 	in	my	hand	by	 put 	 ting 	 	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	in	my	brain	.
and	we	can	use	that	same	 puls 	 e 	 	,	now	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	the	rtpj	,	to	ask	if	we	can	change	people	's	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	.
so	these	are	the	 judgment 	 s 	 	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	,	people	's	normal	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	tms	to	the	rtpj	and	ask	how	people	's	 judgment 	 s 	 	change	.
and	the	first	thing	is	,	people	can	still	do	 th 	 is 	 	task	 over 	 all 	 	.
so	 the 	 ir 	 	 judgment 	 s 	 	of	the	case	when	 every 	 thing 	 	was	fine	remain	the	same	.	they	say	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	no	blame	.
but	in	the	case	of	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	attempt	to	harm	,	where	grace	thought	that	it	was	poison	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	sugar	,	people	now	say	it	was	more	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	less	blame	for	 put 	 ting 	 	the	powder	in	the	coffee	.
and	in	the	case	of	the	accident	,	where	she	thought	that	it	was	sugar	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	poison	and	so	she	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	death	,	people	say	that	it	was	less	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	more	blame	.
so	what	i	've	told	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	people	come	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	well	 equi 	 pped 	 	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	special	brain	system	that	lets	us	think	about	what	other	people	are	 think 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	system	 take 	 s 	 	a	long	time	to	develop	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	course	of	 child 	 hood 	 	and	 in 	 to 	 	early	adolescence	.
and	even	in	 adult 	 hood 	 	,	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	can	explain	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	among	 adult 	 s 	 	in	how	we	think	about	and	 judg 	 e 	 	other	people	.
but	i	want	to	give	the	last	word	back	to	the	 novel 	 ists 	 	,	and	to	philip	roth	,	who	 end 	 ed 	 	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	the	fact	 remain 	 s 	 	that	 get 	 ting 	 	people	right	is	not	what	living	is	all	about	 any 	 way 	 	.
it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	them	wrong	that	is	living	.
 get 	 ting 	 	them	wrong	and	wrong	and	wrong	,	and	then	on	 care 	 ful 	 	 re 	 consider 	 ation 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	them	wrong	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	so	,	i	have	a	question	.	when	you	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	using	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 es 	 	to	change	people	's	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	,	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 alarm 	 ing 	 	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	tell	me	that	you	're	not	taking	phone	 call 	 s 	 	from	the	 pent 	 agon 	 	,	say	.
rs	:	i	'm	not	.
i	mean	,	they	're	 call 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	'm	not	taking	the	call	.
ca	:	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 call 	 ing 	 	?
so	then	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	you	must	lie	awake	at	night	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	work	 lead 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	you	're	 clear 	 ly 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	but	 some 	 one 	 	could	take	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	and	in	some	future	not	-	torture	chamber	,	do	 act 	 s 	 	that	people	here	might	be	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	.
rs	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	worry	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	there	's	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	say	about	tms	.
one	is	that	you	ca	n't	be	tmsed	 with 	 out 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	it	's	not	a	 sur 	 rep 	 tit 	 ious 	 	technology	.
it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	hard	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 change 	 s 	 	.
the	 change 	 s 	 	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	are	 impress 	 ive 	 	to	me	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	they	tell	us	about	the	function	of	the	brain	,	but	they	're	small	on	the	scale	of	the	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	.
and	what	we	 change 	 d 	 	was	not	people	's	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	when	they	're	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	what	to	do	,	when	they	're	making	action	 choice 	 s 	 	.
we	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	 judg 	 e 	 	other	people	's	 action 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	i	think	of	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	not	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 defend 	 ant 	 	in	a	criminal	trial	,	but	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	jury	.
ca	:	is	your	work	going	to	lead	to	any	 recommend 	 ations 	 	in	education	,	to	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	up	a	generation	of	 kid 	 s 	 	able	to	make	 fair 	 er 	 	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	?
rs	:	that	's	one	of	the	 ideal 	 istic 	 	 hope 	 s 	 	.
the	whole	research	program	here	of	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	human	brain	is	brand	new	.
 un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	what	we	 k 	 new 	 	about	the	brain	 we 	 re 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	any	other	animal	's	brain	could	do	too	,	so	we	could	 stud 	 y 	 	it	in	animal	 model 	 s 	 	.
we	 k 	 new 	 	how	 brain 	 s 	 	see	,	and	how	they	control	the	body	and	how	they	hear	and	sense	.
and	the	whole	project	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	 brain 	 s 	 	do	the	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	human	 thing 	 s 	 	--	learn	language	and	abstract	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	and	 think 	 ing 	 	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	--	that	's	brand	new	.
and	we	do	n't	know	yet	what	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	will	be	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	it	.
ca	:	so	i	've	got	one	last	question	.	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	hard	problem	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	that	 puzzl 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	people	.
the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	you	can	understand	why	a	brain	 work 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	.
but	why	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 one 	 	have	to	feel	 any 	 thing 	 	?
why	 do 	 es 	 	it	seem	to	 requir 	 e 	 	these	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	who	sense	 thing 	 s 	 	for	us	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	?
you	're	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	young	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	.
i	mean	,	what	 chance 	 s 	 	do	you	think	there	are	that	at	some	time	in	your	 care 	 er 	 	,	 some 	 one 	 	,	you	or	 some 	 one 	 	else	,	is	going	to	come	up	with	some	paradigm	shift	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	 seem 	 s 	 	an	 im 	 possible 	 	problem	?
rs	:	i	hope	they	do	.	and	i	think	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	wo	n't	.
ca	:	why	?
rs	:	it	's	not	 call 	 ed 	 	the	hard	problem	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	for	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
ca	:	that	's	a	great	answer	.	rebecca	saxe	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	that	was	fantastic	.
