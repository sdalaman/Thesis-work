 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	north	pole	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	most	 north 	 ern 	 	place	in	the	whole	world	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	best	place	to	start	is	with	my	late	father	.
he	was	a	great	 story 	 teller 	 	.
he	could	tell	a	story	about	an	event	,	and	so	you	felt	you	 we 	 re 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	there	at	the	moment	.
and	one	of	the	 st 	 ories 	 	he	told	me	so	often	when	i	was	a	young	boy	was	of	the	first	british	atomic	bomb	test	.
he	had	 be 	 en 	 	there	and	 watch 	 ed 	 	it	go	off	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	explosion	was	so	loud	and	the	light	was	so	 intens 	 e 	 	,	that	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	to	put	his	 hand 	 s 	 	in	front	of	his	face	to	protect	his	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	an	x	-	ray	of	his	 finger 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	light	was	so	bright	.
and	i	know	that	 watch 	 ing 	 	that	atomic	bomb	going	off	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	big	impact	on	my	late	father	.
every	 holi 	 day 	 	i	had	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	boy	was	in	a	national	park	.
what	he	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	me	was	to	inspire	me	to	protect	the	world	,	and	show	me	just	how	fragile	the	world	is	.
he	 al 	 so 	 	told	me	about	the	great	 explore 	 rs 	 	.
he	 love 	 d 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.	he	would	tell	me	about	 cap 	 tain 	 	scott	 walk 	 ing 	 	all	the	way	to	the	south	pole	and	 s 	 ir 	 	edmund	hillary	 climb 	 ing 	 	up	mount	everest	.
and	so	ever	since	i	think	i	was	just	six	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	going	to	the	polar	 region 	 s 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	to	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	.
there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	place	which	drew	me	to	it	.
and	,	well	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	long	time	for	a	dream	to	come	true	.
but	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	went	to	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	for	the	first	time	.
and	it	was	so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	back	there	ever	since	,	for	the	last	seven	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	love	the	place	.
but	i	have	 s 	 een 	 	that	place	change	beyond	all	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	,	just	in	that	short	period	of	time	.
i	have	 s 	 een 	 	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	ice	in	search	of	food	.
i	have	swum	in	front	of	 glaci 	 ers 	 	which	have	 re 	 treat 	 ed 	 	so	much	.
and	i	have	 al 	 so 	 	,	every	year	,	 s 	 een 	 	less	and	less	sea	ice	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	the	world	to	know	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	up	there	.
in	the	two	 year 	 s 	 	before	my	swim	,	23	percent	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	sea	ice	cover	just	 melt 	 ed 	 	away	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	shake	the	 lap 	 el 	 s 	 	of	world	 lead 	 ers 	 	to	get	them	to	understand	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 symbol 	 ic 	 	swim	at	the	top	of	the	world	,	in	a	place	which	should	be	 froze 	 n 	 	over	,	but	which	now	is	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 un 	 freezing 	 	.
and	the	 mess 	 age 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	:	climate	change	is	for	real	,	and	we	need	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
and	we	need	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	right	now	.
well	,	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	north	pole	,	it	's	not	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	thing	to	do	.
i	mean	,	just	to	put	it	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	27	 degree 	 s 	 	is	the	temperature	of	a	normal	 in 	 door 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	pool	.
 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	the	temperature	of	the	english	channel	was	18	 degree 	 s 	 	.
the	 passenger 	 s 	 	who	fell	off	the	 titan 	 ic 	 	fell	 in 	 to 	 	water	of	just	five	 degree 	 s 	 	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	.
fresh	water	 freeze 	 s 	 	at	zero	.
and	the	water	at	the	north	pole	is	minus	1.7	.
it	's	 fuck 	 ing 	 	freezing	.
i	'm	sorry	,	but	there	is	no	other	way	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	.
and	so	i	had	to	assemble	an	 in 	 credible 	 	team	around	me	to	help	me	with	 th 	 is 	 	task	.
i	 assemble 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	team	of	29	people	from	10	 nation 	 s 	 	.
some	people	think	that	 swimm 	 ing 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 olo 	 	 s 	 port 	 	,	you	just	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sea	and	off	you	go	.
it	could	n't	be	further	from	the	truth	for	me	.
and	i	then	went	and	did	a	huge	amount	of	training	,	 swimm 	 ing 	 	in	 ic 	 y 	 	water	,	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	and	 forward 	 s 	 	.
but	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	was	to	train	my	mind	to	 prep 	 are 	 	 my 	 self 	 	for	what	was	going	to	happen	.
and	i	had	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	the	swim	.
i	had	to	see	it	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	all	the	way	to	the	end	.
i	had	to	taste	the	salt	water	in	my	mouth	.
i	had	to	see	my	coach	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	for	me	,	``	come	on	lewis	!	come	on	!	go	!	go	!	go	!	do	n't	 s 	 low 	 	down	!	``
and	so	i	 liter 	 ally 	 	swam	 a 	 cross 	 	the	north	pole	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	in	my	mind	.
and	then	,	after	a	year	of	training	,	i	felt	ready	.
i	felt	confident	that	i	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	swim	.
so	 my 	 self 	 	and	the	five	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	team	,	we	 hitch 	 ed 	 	a	ride	on	an	 ice 	 breaker 	 	which	was	going	to	the	north	pole	.
and	on	day	four	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	just	do	a	quick	five	minute	test	swim	.
i	had	never	swum	in	water	of	minus	1.7	 degree 	 s 	 	before	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	just	 im 	 possible 	 	to	train	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 type 	 s 	 	of	 condition 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	the	ship	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	.
we	all	got	down	onto	the	ice	,	and	i	then	got	 in 	 to 	 	my	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 cost 	 ume 	 	and	i	 div 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sea	.
i	have	never	in	my	life	felt	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	moment	.
i	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	breathe	.	i	was	 gasp 	 ing 	 	for	air	.
i	was	 hyper 	 ventil 	 ating 	 	so	much	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	 second 	 s 	 	my	 hand 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	numb	.
and	it	was	--	the	paradox	is	that	you	're	in	freezing	cold	water	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	you	're	on	fire	.
i	swam	 a 	 s 	 	hard	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	for	five	 minute 	 s 	 	.
i	remember	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	out	of	the	water	.
i	 climb 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	ice	.
and	i	remember	taking	the	 go 	 gg 	 les 	 	off	my	face	and	looking	down	at	my	 hand 	 s 	 	in	 she 	 er 	 	shock	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 finger 	 s 	 	had	swollen	so	much	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	like	 sausage 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	swollen	so	much	,	i	could	n't	even	close	them	.
what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	that	we	are	made	 partial 	 ly 	 	of	water	,	and	when	water	 freeze 	 s 	 	it	 expand 	 s 	 	.
and	so	what	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	that	the	 cell 	 s 	 	in	my	 finger 	 s 	 	had	 froze 	 n 	 	and	 expand 	 ed 	 	.
and	they	had	burst	.	and	i	was	in	so	much	 agon 	 y 	 	.
i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	got	 rush 	 ed 	 	onto	the	ship	and	 in 	 to 	 	a	hot	shower	.
and	i	remember	 stand 	 ing 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	the	hot	shower	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 de 	 frost 	 	my	 finger 	 s 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	in	two	 day 	 s 	 	'	time	,	i	was	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	swim	 a 	 cross 	 	the	north	pole	.
i	was	going	to	try	and	do	a	20	-	minute	swim	,	for	one	kilometer	 a 	 cross 	 	the	north	pole	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	dream	which	i	had	had	ever	since	i	was	a	young	boy	with	my	father	,	was	just	going	out	the	window	.
there	is	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	going	to	happen	.
and	i	remember	then	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	the	shower	and	 real 	 izing 	 	i	could	n't	even	feel	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	for	a	 swimm 	 er 	 	,	you	need	to	feel	your	 hand 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	need	to	be	able	to	grab	the	water	and	pull	it	through	with	you	.
the	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	and	i	was	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	state	of	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	and	all	i	could	think	about	was	 s 	 ir 	 	ranulph	fiennes	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	know	him	,	he	's	the	great	british	 explore 	 r 	 	.
a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	he	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	ski	all	the	way	to	the	north	pole	.
he	 accident 	 ally 	 	fell	through	the	ice	 in 	 to 	 	the	sea	.
and	after	just	three	 minute 	 s 	 	in	that	water	,	he	was	able	to	get	 him 	 self 	 	out	.
and	his	 hand 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	 bad 	 ly 	 	 frost 	 bitten 	 	that	he	had	to	return	to	england	.
he	went	to	a	local	hospital	and	there	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ran	,	there	is	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	us	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 s 	 ave 	 	these	 finger 	 s 	 	.
we	are	going	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	take	them	off	.	``
and	ran	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	his	tool	shed	and	take	out	a	saw	and	do	it	 him 	 self 	 	.
and	all	i	could	think	of	was	,	if	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	ran	after	three	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	i	ca	n't	feel	my	 hand 	 s 	 	after	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	what	on	earth	is	going	to	happen	if	i	try	20	 minute 	 s 	 	?
at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	,	i	'm	going	to	end	up	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	some	 finger 	 s 	 	.
and	at	worst	,	i	did	n't	even	want	to	think	about	it	.
we	carried	on	 s 	 ailing 	 	through	the	ice	 pack 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	north	pole	.
and	my	close	friend	david	,	he	saw	the	way	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	and	he	came	up	to	me	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	lewis	,	i	've	known	you	since	you	 we 	 re 	 	18	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	've	known	you	,	and	i	know	,	lewis	,	deep	down	,	right	deep	down	here	,	that	you	are	going	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	swim	.
i	so	 believ 	 e 	 	in	you	lewis	.	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	way	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	training	.
and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	the	reason	why	you	're	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	swim	.
we	stand	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	moment	in	 th 	 is 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	you	're	going	to	make	a	 symbol 	 ic 	 	swim	here	to	try	to	shake	the	 lap 	 el 	 s 	 	of	world	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
lewis	,	have	the	courage	to	go	in	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	going	to	look	after	you	every	moment	of	it	.	``
and	i	just	,	i	got	so	much	confidence	from	him	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 k 	 new 	 	me	so	well	.
so	we	carried	on	 s 	 ailing 	 	and	we	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	the	north	pole	.
and	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	the	ship	,	and	it	was	just	 a 	 s 	 	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	had	 predict 	 ed 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	open	 patch 	 es 	 	of	sea	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	i	went	down	 in 	 to 	 	my	 cab 	 in 	 	and	i	put	on	my	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 cost 	 ume 	 	.
and	then	the	doctor	 s 	 trapped 	 	on	a	chest	monitor	,	which	 measure 	 s 	 	my	core	body	temperature	and	my	heart	rate	.
and	then	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	onto	the	ice	.
and	i	remember	looking	 in 	 to 	 	the	ice	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	big	 chunk 	 s 	 	of	white	ice	in	there	,	and	the	water	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	black	.
i	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	black	water	before	.
and	it	is	4,200	 meter 	 s 	 	deep	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	lewis	,	do	n't	look	left	,	do	n't	look	right	.
just	scuttle	forward	and	go	for	it	.	``
and	so	i	now	want	to	show	you	a	short	video	of	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	on	the	ice	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	we	're	just	 s 	 ailing 	 	out	of	harbor	now	,	and	it	's	at	 th 	 is 	 	stage	when	one	can	have	a	bit	of	a	 wo 	 bble 	 	 ment 	 ally 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	just	 look 	 s 	 	so	gray	around	here	,	and	 look 	 s 	 	so	cold	.
we	've	just	 s 	 een 	 	our	first	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 magic 	 al 	 	.
a	mother	and	a	cub	,	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	sight	.
and	to	think	that	in	30	,	40	 year 	 s 	 	they	could	 be 	 come 	 	extinct	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	thought	.
we	're	 final 	 ly 	 	at	the	north	pole	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 month 	 s 	 	and	 month 	 s 	 	and	 month 	 s 	 	of	 dream 	 ing 	 	to	get	here	,	 year 	 s 	 	of	training	and	 plan 	 ning 	 	and	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	.
ooh	.	in	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	'	time	i	'm	going	to	get	in	here	and	do	my	swim	.
it	's	all	a	little	bit	 frighten 	 ing 	 	,	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	.
amundson	,	you	ready	?	amudson	:	ready	.

but	was	it	worth	it	?	 y 	 es 	 	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	it	was	.
there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	who	do	n't	know	now	about	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	.
and	people	ask	me	,	``	lewis	,	what	can	we	do	about	climate	change	?	``
and	i	say	to	them	,	i	think	we	need	to	do	three	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	first	thing	we	need	to	do	is	we	need	to	break	 th 	 is 	 	problem	down	 in 	 to 	 	 manage 	 able 	 	 chunk 	 s 	 	.
you	saw	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	video	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 flag 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 flag 	 s 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	the	 count 	 ries 	 	from	which	my	team	came	from	.
and	 equal 	 ly 	 	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	climate	change	,	every	single	country	is	going	to	have	to	make	 cut 	 s 	 	.
britain	,	america	,	japan	,	south	africa	,	the	congo	.
all	of	us	together	,	we	're	all	on	the	same	ship	together	.
the	second	thing	we	need	to	do	is	we	need	to	just	look	back	at	how	far	we	have	come	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	short	period	of	time	.
i	remember	,	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 s 	 peaking 	 	about	climate	change	,	and	people	 heck 	 ling 	 	me	in	the	back	and	 say 	 ing 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	exist	.
i	've	just	come	back	from	giving	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 speech 	 es 	 	in	some	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 town 	 ship 	 s 	 	in	south	africa	to	young	children	 a 	 s 	 	young	 a 	 s 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
four	or	five	children	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	desk	,	and	even	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 poor 	 est 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	they	all	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	grasp	of	climate	change	.
we	need	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
now	is	the	time	to	 believ 	 e 	 	.
we	've	come	a	long	way	.	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	good	.
but	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	we	must	do	is	,	i	think	,	we	must	all	walk	to	the	end	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	and	turn	around	,	and	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	most	fundamental	question	.
and	that	is	,	``	what	type	of	world	do	we	want	to	live	in	,	and	what	decision	are	we	going	to	make	 to 	 day 	 	to	ensure	that	we	all	live	in	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	world	?	``
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
