i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	come	here	and	speak	about	creation	.
and	i	 on 	 ly 	 	have	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	i	see	they	're	 count 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
and	i	can	--	in	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	think	i	can	touch	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 janitor 	 ial 	 	branch	of	creation	,	which	i	call	``	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.	``
 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	how	we	cope	with	creation	.
while	creation	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	a	bit	un	-	 grasp 	 able 	 	,	or	even	 point 	 less 	 	,	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	.
see	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
you	know	,	creation	is	what	put	that	dog	in	that	picture	,	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	see	a	chicken	on	his	 hind 	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
when	you	think	about	--	you	know	,	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	do	with	 caus 	 ality 	 	too	.
you	know	,	when	i	was	a	teenager	,	i	was	a	creator	.
i	just	did	 thing 	 s 	 	.
then	i	 be 	 came 	 	an	adult	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	who	i	was	,	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	maintain	that	 person 	 a 	 	--	i	 be 	 came 	 	creative	.
it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	a	book	and	a	 retrospect 	 ive 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	,	that	i	could	track	 exact 	 ly 	 	--	 look 	 s 	 	like	all	the	 crazi 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	had	 d 	 one 	 	,	all	my	 drink 	 ing 	 	,	all	my	 part 	 ies 	 	--	they	 follow 	 ed 	 	a	straight	line	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	the	point	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	.
 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	true	,	you	know	,	the	reason	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	right	now	is	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	born	in	brazil	.
if	i	was	born	in	monterey	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	be	in	brazil	.
you	know	,	i	was	born	in	brazil	and	grew	up	in	the	'70s	under	a	climate	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 di 	 stress 	 	,	and	i	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	learn	to	communicate	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	way	--	in	a	sort	of	a	 semi 	 otic 	 	black	market	.
you	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	say	what	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	;	you	had	to	invent	ways	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
you	did	n't	trust	information	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
that	led	me	to	 an 	 other 	 	step	of	why	i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 like 	 d 	 	media	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	.
i	was	a	media	 junk 	 ie 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	got	 involve 	 d 	 	with	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
my	first	job	in	brazil	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	develop	a	way	to	improve	the	 read 	 ability 	 	of	 bill 	 board 	 s 	 	,	and	based	on	speed	,	angle	of	approach	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 block 	 s 	 	of	text	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	got	me	a	job	in	an	ad	 age 	 ncy 	 	.
and	they	 al 	 so 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	had	to	--	to	give	me	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	plexiglas	trophy	for	it	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	point	--	why	i	'm	here	--	is	that	the	day	i	went	to	pick	up	the	plexiglas	trophy	,	i	 rent 	 ed 	 	a	tuxedo	for	the	first	time	in	my	life	,	 pick 	 ed 	 	the	thing	--	did	n't	have	any	 friend 	 s 	 	.
on	my	way	out	,	i	had	to	break	a	fight	 a 	 part 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	was	hitting	 some 	 body 	 	else	with	 bra 	 s 	 s 	 	 knuckle 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 tuxedo 	 s 	 	,	and	 fight 	 ing 	 	.	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	--	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	people	do	that	all	the	time	--	--	and	i	--	well	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	when	i	went	back	,	it	was	on	the	way	back	to	my	car	,	the	guy	who	got	hit	 decide 	 d 	 	to	grab	a	gun	--	i	do	n't	know	why	he	had	a	gun	--	and	shoot	the	first	person	he	 decide 	 d 	 	to	be	his	 aggress 	 or 	 	.
the	first	person	was	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	black	tie	,	a	tuxedo	.	it	was	me	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	it	was	n't	fatal	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	all	see	.
and	,	even	more	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	the	guy	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	was	sorry	and	i	 bribe 	 d 	 	him	for	 compens 	 ation 	 	money	,	 other 	 wise 	 	i	press	 charge 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	how	--	with	 th 	 is 	 	money	i	paid	for	a	ticket	to	come	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	1983	,	and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	--	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	reason	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	here	 to 	 day 	 	:	 be 	 cause 	 	i	got	shot	.
well	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	my	own	work	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	should	n't	do	 image 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	--	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 iconoclast 	 ic 	 	approach	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	--	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 air 	 brush 	 	naked	people	on	ice	,	for	 whisk 	 ey 	 	 commercial 	 s 	 	,	that	's	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
but	i	--	they	did	n't	let	me	do	it	,	so	i	just	--	you	know	,	they	would	 on 	 ly 	 	let	me	do	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	i	was	n't	 in 	 to 	 	selling	 whisk 	 ey 	 	;	i	was	 in 	 to 	 	selling	ice	.

 be 	 cause 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	can	mean	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	.
but	now	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	work	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	tech	way	,	so	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	mean	at	the	same	time	a	lump	of	cotton	,	a	cloud	and	durer	's	 pray 	 ing 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	a	lot	more	like	mickey	mouse	's	 pray 	 ing 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.

and	he	did	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 trick 	 y 	 	.
he	put	together	two	different	media	from	different	 period 	 s 	 	of	time	.
first	,	he	got	an	age	-	old	way	of	making	it	,	which	was	relief	,	and	he	 work 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	three	-	point	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	which	was	brand	-	new	technology	at	the	time	.
and	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 over 	 kill 	 	.
and	your	eye	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	which	level	to	read	.
and	you	 be 	 come 	 	trapped	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 represent 	 ation 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	make	these	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 render 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	that	at	first	they	are	taken	 a 	 s 	 	a	line	 draw 	 ing 	 	--	you	know	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	--	and	then	i	did	it	with	wire	.
the	idea	was	to	--	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 overlook 	 s 	 	white	--	like	pencil	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	you	know	?
and	they	would	look	at	it	--	``	ah	,	it	's	a	pencil	 draw 	 ing 	 	.	``
then	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	double	take	and	see	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	time	.
it	had	a	 physical 	 ity 	 	,	and	you	start	going	 deep 	 er 	 	and	 deep 	 er 	 	 in 	 to 	 	sort	of	narrative	that	 go 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	image	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	``	monkey	with	leica	.	``

and	the	same	way	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 represent 	 ation 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	from	line	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 had 	 ed 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	deal	with	other	 subject 	 s 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	that	 in 	 to 	 	the	realm	of	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 al 	 most 	 	a	picture	of	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
i	made	these	 picture 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 read 	 	,	``	and	i	named	them	after	the	amount	of	 yard 	 s 	 	that	i	used	to	represent	each	picture	.
these	 al 	 ways 	 	end	up	 be 	 ing 	 	a	photograph	at	the	end	,	or	more	like	an	 etch 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 light 	 house 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	``	6,500	 yard 	 s 	 	,	``	after	corot	.	``	9,000	 yard 	 s 	 	,	``	after	gerhard	richter	.
and	i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	 yard 	 s 	 	,	after	john	constable	.
departing	from	the	lines	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	tackle	the	idea	of	 point 	 s 	 	,	like	which	is	more	similar	to	the	type	of	 represent 	 ation 	 	that	we	find	in	 photograph 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	had	met	a	group	of	children	in	the	caribbean	 is 	 land 	 	of	saint	kitts	,	and	i	did	work	and	play	with	them	.

and	by	 manipul 	 ating 	 	sugar	over	a	black	paper	,	i	made	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	them	.
these	are	--	--	thank	you	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	``	valentina	,	the	 fast 	 est 	 	.	``

but	 an 	 other 	 	layer	of	 represent 	 ation 	 	was	still	 introduc 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	while	i	was	making	these	 picture 	 s 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	could	add	still	 an 	 other 	 	thing	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	subject	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	interfere	with	the	 theme 	 s 	 	,	so	chocolate	is	 ver 	 y 	 	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	--	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	mind	 idea 	 s 	 	that	go	from	 s 	 cat 	 ology 	 	to	 rom 	 ance 	 	.

you	know	an	artist	's	first	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	who	 count 	 ed 	 	it	?	you	know	?

they	end	up	 be 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 picture 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 photograph 	 ed 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	camera	--	an	8x10	camera	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	used	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	a	joke	--	you	know	,	make	--	the	same	like	--	robert	smithson	's	``	spiral	 jet 	 ty 	 	``	--	and	then	 leav 	 ing 	 	 trace 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	on	a	 table 	 top 	 	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	prove	that	he	did	n't	do	that	thing	in	the	salt	lake	.
but	then	,	just	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 model 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explore	the	relationship	between	the	model	and	the	original	.
and	i	felt	that	i	would	have	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	there	and	make	some	 earth 	 work 	 s 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	opt	for	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	line	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	kind	of	stupid	looking	.

now	i	would	do	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 one 	 s 	 	,	which	would	be	like	--	but	under	the	same	light	,	and	i	would	show	them	together	,	so	the	 view 	 er 	 	would	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	figure	it	out	what	one	he	was	looking	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	a	pipe	.

and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	i	did	--	you	know	 work 	 ing 	 	--	 every 	 body 	 	 love 	 s 	 	to	watch	 some 	 body 	 	draw	,	but	not	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	a	chance	to	watch	 some 	 body 	 	draw	in	--	a	lot	of	people	at	the	same	time	,	to	evidence	a	single	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	love	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	these	 cartoon 	 ish 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	over	manhattan	for	a	period	of	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	an	interest	--	an	early	interest	--	in	theater	,	that	's	 just 	 ified 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.

and	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	'd	have	like	a	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	cloud	,	and	it	is	a	cloud	at	the	same	time	.
so	they	're	like	perfect	 act 	 ors 	 	.
my	interest	in	 act 	 ing 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	bad	 act 	 ing 	 	,	 go 	 es 	 	a	long	way	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	once	paid	like	60	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	see	a	 ver 	 y 	 	great	 a 	 ctor 	 	to	do	a	version	of	``	king	lear	,	``	and	i	felt	 re 	 ally 	 	 rob 	 bed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	by	the	time	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	king	lear	,	he	 stop 	 ped 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	great	 a 	 ctor 	 	that	i	had	paid	money	to	see	.
on	the	other	hand	,	you	know	,	i	paid	like	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	i	think	--	and	i	went	to	a	 ware 	 house 	 	in	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	to	see	a	version	of	``	othello	``	by	an	amateur	group	.
and	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	the	guy	--	his	name	was	joey	grimaldi	--	he	 imperson 	 ated 	 	the	moorish	general	--	you	know	,	for	the	first	three	 minute 	 s 	 	he	was	 re 	 ally 	 	that	general	,	and	then	he	went	back	 in 	 to 	 	 plumb 	 er 	 	,	he	 work 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 plumb 	 er 	 	,	so	--	 plumb 	 er 	 	,	general	,	 plumb 	 er 	 	,	general	--	so	for	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	i	saw	two	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	for	the	price	of	one	.
see	,	i	think	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	about	impression	,	making	people	fall	for	a	 re 	 ally 	 	perfect	illusion	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	to	make	--	i	 usual 	 ly 	 	work	at	the	 low 	 est 	 	threshold	of	visual	illusion	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	about	 fool 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	giving	 some 	 body 	 	a	measure	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	belief	:	how	much	you	want	to	be	 fool 	 ed 	 	.
that	's	why	we	pay	to	go	to	magic	 show 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
well	,	i	think	that	's	it	.
my	time	is	 near 	 ly 	 	up	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
