i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	for	a	long	time	,	and	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	have	 acquir 	 ed 	 	a	body	of	knowledge	about	 kid 	 s 	 	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	wish	more	people	would	understand	about	the	potential	of	 student 	 s 	 	.
in	1931	,	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	--	bottom	left	for	you	 guy 	 s 	 	over	here	--	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	the	eighth	grade	.
she	went	to	school	to	get	the	information	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	the	information	lived	.
it	was	in	the	 book 	 s 	 	;	it	was	 in 	 side 	 	the	teacher	's	head	;	and	she	 need 	 ed 	 	to	go	there	to	get	the	information	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	how	you	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
fast	-	forward	a	generation	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	one	-	room	 school 	 house 	 	,	oak	grove	,	where	my	father	went	to	a	one	-	room	 school 	 house 	 	.
and	he	 aga 	 in 	 	had	to	travel	to	the	school	to	get	the	information	from	the	teacher	,	 store 	 d 	 	it	in	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 port 	 able 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	he	 ha 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 in 	 side 	 	his	own	head	,	and	take	it	with	him	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	how	information	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 transport 	 ed 	 	from	teacher	to	student	and	then	used	in	the	world	.
when	i	was	a	kid	,	we	had	a	set	of	 encyclopedia 	 s 	 	at	my	house	.
it	was	 purchase 	 d 	 	the	year	i	was	born	,	and	it	was	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	not	have	to	wait	to	go	to	the	library	to	get	to	the	information	.
the	information	was	 in 	 side 	 	my	house	and	it	was	awesome	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	different	than	either	generation	had	 experience 	 d 	 	before	,	and	it	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	i	 interact 	 ed 	 	with	information	even	at	just	a	small	level	.
but	the	information	was	 close 	 r 	 	to	me	.
i	could	get	access	to	it	.
in	the	time	that	 pass 	 es 	 	between	when	i	was	a	kid	in	high	school	and	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	see	the	 ad 	 vent 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
right	about	the	time	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 get 	 s 	 	going	 a 	 s 	 	an	 education 	 al 	 	tool	,	i	take	off	from	wisconsin	and	move	to	kansas	,	small	town	kansas	,	where	i	had	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	teach	in	a	 love 	 ly 	 	,	small	-	town	,	 r 	 ural 	 	kansas	school	 di 	 strict 	 	,	where	i	was	 teach 	 ing 	 	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	subject	,	american	government	.
my	first	year	--	super	gung	-	ho	--	going	to	teach	american	government	,	 love 	 d 	 	the	 politic 	 al 	 	system	.
 kid 	 s 	 	in	the	12th	grade	:	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	all	that	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	about	the	american	government	system	.
year	two	:	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	--	had	to	change	my	tactic	.
and	i	put	in	front	of	them	an	authentic	experience	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	them	to	learn	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	did	n't	tell	them	what	to	do	or	how	to	do	it	.
i	posed	a	problem	in	front	of	them	,	which	was	to	put	on	an	election	forum	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	community	.
they	 produce 	 d 	 	 fli 	 ers 	 	.	they	 call 	 ed 	 	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	.
they	 check 	 ed 	 	 schedule 	 s 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	 secret 	 aries 	 	.
they	 produce 	 d 	 	an	election	forum	 book 	 let 	 	for	the	entire	town	to	learn	more	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 candid 	 ates 	 	.
they	 invit 	 ed 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	school	for	an	 even 	 ing 	 	of	conversation	about	government	and	 politic 	 s 	 	and	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	the	 street 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 d 	 one 	 	well	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	 ro 	 bust 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 ential 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
the	 old 	 er 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	--	more	 experience 	 d 	 	--	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	and	went	,	``	oh	,	there	she	is	.	that	's	so	cute	.	she	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	that	 d 	 one 	 	.	``
``	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	what	she	's	in	for	.	``
but	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	the	 kid 	 s 	 	would	show	up	,	and	i	 believ 	 ed 	 	it	,	and	i	told	them	every	week	what	i	 expect 	 ed 	 	out	of	them	.
and	that	night	,	all	90	 kid 	 s 	 	--	 dress 	 ed 	 	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	job	,	 own 	 ing 	 	it	.
i	had	to	just	 s 	 it 	 	and	watch	.
it	was	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	.	it	was	 ex 	 peri 	 ential 	 	.	it	was	authentic	.
it	 me 	 ant 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	them	.
and	they	will	step	up	.
from	kansas	,	i	 move 	 d 	 	on	to	 love 	 ly 	 	arizona	,	where	i	taught	in	flagstaff	for	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	time	with	middle	school	 student 	 s 	 	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	i	did	n't	have	to	teach	them	american	government	.
could	teach	them	the	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	of	 geo 	 graphy 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	``	 thrill 	 ed 	 	``	to	learn	.
but	what	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	position	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	in	arizona	,	was	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 eclec 	 tic 	 	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	to	work	with	in	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	public	school	,	and	we	got	to	have	these	 moment 	 s 	 	where	we	would	get	these	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
and	one	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	was	we	got	to	go	and	meet	paul	rusesabagina	,	which	is	the	 gentle 	 man 	 	that	the	movie	``	hotel	rwanda	``	is	based	after	.
and	he	was	going	to	speak	at	the	high	school	next	door	to	us	.
we	could	walk	there	.	we	did	n't	even	have	to	pay	for	the	 bus 	 es 	 	.
there	was	no	expense	cost	.	perfect	field	trip	.
the	problem	then	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	how	do	you	take	 seven 	 th 	 	-	and	eighth	-	graders	to	a	talk	about	genocide	and	deal	with	the	subject	in	a	way	that	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	and	 respect 	 ful 	 	,	and	they	know	what	to	do	with	it	.
and	so	we	chose	to	look	at	paul	rusesabagina	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	who	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ly 	 	used	his	life	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	positive	.
i	then	 challeng 	 ed 	 	the	 kid 	 s 	 	to	identify	 some 	 one 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	life	,	or	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	story	,	or	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	world	,	that	they	could	identify	that	had	 d 	 one 	 	a	similar	thing	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	produce	a	little	movie	about	it	.
it	's	the	first	time	we	'd	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	make	these	little	 movie 	 s 	 	on	the	computer	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	put	 the 	 ir 	 	own	voice	over	it	.
it	was	the	most	awesome	moment	of	 revel 	 ation 	 	that	when	you	ask	 kid 	 s 	 	to	use	 the 	 ir 	 	own	voice	and	ask	them	to	speak	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	what	they	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	share	.
the	last	question	of	the	 assign 	 ment 	 	is	:	how	do	you	plan	to	use	your	life	to	 positive 	 ly 	 	impact	other	people	?
the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 kid 	 s 	 	will	say	when	you	ask	them	and	take	the	time	to	listen	is	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
fast	-	forward	to	pennsylvania	,	where	i	find	 my 	 self 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	teach	at	the	science	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	academy	,	which	is	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	school	between	the	franklin	institute	and	the	school	 di 	 strict 	 	of	philadelphia	.
we	are	a	nine	through	12	public	school	,	but	we	do	school	 quit 	 e 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
i	 move 	 d 	 	there	 prim 	 arily 	 	to	be	part	of	a	 learn 	 ing 	 	environment	that	 valid 	 ated 	 	the	way	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	 kid 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	investigate	what	was	possible	when	you	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	let	go	of	some	of	the	 paradigm 	 s 	 	of	the	past	,	of	information	 scar 	 city 	 	when	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	was	in	school	and	when	my	father	was	in	school	and	even	when	i	was	in	school	,	and	to	a	moment	when	we	have	information	 sur 	 plus 	 	.
so	what	do	you	do	when	the	information	is	all	around	you	?
why	do	you	have	 kid 	 s 	 	come	to	school	if	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	have	to	come	there	to	get	the	information	?
in	philadelphia	we	have	a	one	-	to	-	one	 lap 	 top 	 	program	,	so	the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	with	them	 every 	 day 	 	,	taking	them	home	,	 get 	 ting 	 	access	to	information	.
and	here	's	the	thing	that	you	need	to	get	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	when	you	've	 give 	 n 	 	the	tool	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	information	to	 student 	 s 	 	,	is	that	you	have	to	be	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 allow 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	fail	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	process	.
we	deal	right	now	in	the	 education 	 al 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	with	an	 infatu 	 ation 	 	with	the	culture	of	one	right	answer	that	can	be	 proper 	 ly 	 	 bubble 	 d 	 	on	the	average	 multi 	 ple 	 	choice	test	,	and	i	am	here	to	share	with	you	:	it	is	not	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
that	is	the	absolute	wrong	thing	to	ask	,	to	tell	 kid 	 s 	 	to	never	be	wrong	.
to	ask	them	to	 al 	 ways 	 	have	the	right	answer	 do 	 es 	 	n't	allow	them	to	learn	.
so	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 artifact 	 s 	 	of	the	project	.
i	 al 	 most 	 	never	show	them	off	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	issue	of	the	idea	of	failure	.
my	 student 	 s 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	these	info	-	 graphic 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	a	unit	that	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	at	the	end	of	the	year	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	the	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	take	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	of	the	info	-	 graphic 	 s 	 	that	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	a	lot	of	mass	media	,	and	take	a	look	at	what	 we 	 re 	 	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 component 	 s 	 	of	it	,	and	produce	one	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	of	a	different	man	-	made	disaster	from	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	they	had	certain	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	to	do	it	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	a	little	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	'd	never	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	,	and	they	did	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	to	do	it	.
they	can	talk	--	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	,	and	they	can	write	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	but	 ask 	 ing 	 	them	to	communicate	 idea 	 s 	 	in	a	different	way	was	a	little	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	for	them	.
but	i	 g 	 ave 	 	them	the	room	to	just	do	the	thing	.
go	create	.	go	figure	it	out	.
let	's	see	what	we	can	do	.
and	the	student	that	 persist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	best	visual	product	did	not	disappoint	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	like	two	or	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	work	of	the	student	that	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	did	it	.
and	when	i	 s 	 at 	 	the	 student 	 s 	 	down	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	who	's	got	the	best	one	?	``
and	they	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	went	,	``	there	it	is	.	``
did	n't	read	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``	there	it	is	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	what	 make 	 s 	 	it	great	?	``
and	they	're	like	,	``	oh	,	the	design	's	good	,	and	he	's	using	good	color	.
and	there	's	some	...	``	and	they	went	through	all	that	we	 process 	 ed 	 	out	loud	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	go	read	it	.	``
and	they	're	like	,	``	oh	,	that	one	was	n't	so	awesome	.	``
and	then	we	went	to	 an 	 other 	 	one	--	it	did	n't	have	great	 visual 	 s 	 	,	but	it	had	great	information	--	and	 s 	 pent 	 	an	hour	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	process	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	n't	about	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	it	was	perfect	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	it	was	what	i	could	create	.
it	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	create	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	it	 allow 	 ed 	 	them	to	fail	,	process	,	learn	from	.
and	when	we	do	 an 	 other 	 	round	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	class	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	they	will	do	better	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	include	an	amount	of	failure	,	 be 	 cause 	 	failure	is	 instruct 	 ional 	 	in	the	process	.
there	are	a	million	 picture 	 s 	 	that	i	could	click	through	here	,	and	had	to	 choos 	 e 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	--	of	 student 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	of	what	 learn 	 ing 	 	can	look	like	in	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	where	we	let	go	of	the	idea	that	 kid 	 s 	 	have	to	come	to	school	to	get	the	information	,	but	 in 	 stead 	 	,	ask	them	what	they	can	do	with	it	.
ask	them	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
they	will	not	disappoint	.
ask	them	to	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	,	to	see	 thing 	 s 	 	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	experience	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	to	play	,	to	 inquir 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	taken	on	tuesday	,	when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 student 	 s 	 	to	go	to	the	 poll 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	robbie	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	his	first	day	of	 vot 	 ing 	 	,	and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	that	with	 every 	 body 	 	and	do	that	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 learn 	 ing 	 	too	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	real	 space 	 s 	 	.
the	main	point	is	that	,	if	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	look	at	education	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	about	coming	to	school	to	get	the	information	and	not	about	 ex 	 peri 	 ential 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	 empower 	 ing 	 	student	voice	and	 em 	 bracing 	 	failure	,	we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	mark	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	n't	possible	if	we	keep	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	 education 	 al 	 	system	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	value	these	 qual 	 ities 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	wo	n't	get	there	with	a	 standard 	 ized 	 	test	,	and	we	wo	n't	get	there	with	a	culture	of	one	right	answer	.
we	know	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	better	,	and	it	's	time	to	do	better	.
