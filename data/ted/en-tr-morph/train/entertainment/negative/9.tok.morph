 a 	 s 	 	you	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	every	time	you	come	here	,	you	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	the	world	's	 expert 	 s 	 	from	i	guess	three	or	four	different	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	on	building	 seat 	 s 	 	,	i	think	 conclude 	 d 	 	that	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	the	solution	is	,	people	should	n't	 s 	 it 	 	down	.
i	could	have	told	them	that	.
 yester 	 day 	 	,	the	 auto 	 motive 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	us	some	new	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	.
they	 point 	 ed 	 	out	that	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	was	between	30	and	50	 year 	 s 	 	from	 to 	 day 	 	,	they	will	be	 steer 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	by	wire	,	 with 	 out 	 	all	that	 mechanic 	 al 	 	stuff	.
that	's	 re 	 assur 	 ing 	 	.
they	then	 point 	 ed 	 	out	that	there	'd	be	,	sort	of	,	the	other	 control 	 s 	 	by	wire	,	to	get	rid	of	all	that	 mechanic 	 al 	 	stuff	.
that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	,	but	why	not	get	rid	of	the	 wire 	 s 	 	?
then	you	do	n't	need	 any 	 thing 	 	to	control	the	car	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
i	would	love	to	talk	about	the	technology	,	and	 some 	 time 	 	,	in	what	's	past	the	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	'll	be	happy	to	talk	to	all	the	techno	-	 geek 	 s 	 	around	here	about	what	's	in	here	.
but	if	i	had	one	thing	to	say	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	before	we	get	to	first	,	it	would	be	that	from	the	time	we	 start 	 ed 	 	building	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	big	idea	was	n't	the	technology	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	was	a	big	idea	in	technology	when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	it	in	the	ibot	for	the	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	community	.
the	big	idea	here	is	,	i	think	,	a	new	piece	of	a	solution	to	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	big	problem	in	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	to	put	that	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	:	there	's	so	much	data	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	'll	be	happy	to	give	it	to	you	in	different	 form 	 s 	 	.
you	never	know	what	 strike 	 s 	 	the	 f 	 ancy 	 	of	whom	,	but	 every 	 body 	 	is	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	the	car	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	.
and	henry	ford	,	just	about	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 start 	 ed 	 	 crank 	 ing 	 	out	model	ts	.
what	i	do	n't	think	most	people	think	about	is	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	how	technology	is	 appli 	 ed 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	that	time	,	91	percent	of	america	lived	either	on	 farm 	 s 	 	or	in	small	 town 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	car	--	the	 horse 	 less 	 	carriage	that	 replace 	 d 	 	the	horse	and	carriage	--	was	a	big	deal	;	it	went	twice	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	a	horse	and	carriage	.
it	was	half	 a 	 s 	 	long	.
and	it	was	an	 environment 	 al 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	1903	they	 out 	 law 	 ed 	 	 horse 	 s 	 	and	 bug 	 gie 	 s 	 	in	 down 	 town 	 	manhattan	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	imagine	what	the	 road 	 s 	 	look	like	when	you	have	a	million	 horse 	 s 	 	,	and	a	million	of	them	 urin 	 ating 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 ty 	 ph 	 oid 	 	and	other	 problem 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 un 	 imagin 	 able 	 	.
so	the	car	was	the	clean	 environment 	 al 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	to	a	horse	and	 bug 	 gy 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	was	a	way	for	people	to	get	from	 the 	 ir 	 	farm	to	a	farm	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	farm	to	a	town	,	or	from	a	town	to	a	city	.
it	all	made	sense	,	with	91	percent	of	the	people	living	there	.
by	the	1950s	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 connect 	 ing 	 	all	the	 town 	 s 	 	together	with	what	a	lot	of	people	claim	is	the	eighth	wonder	of	the	world	,	the	 high 	 way 	 	system	.
and	it	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	a	wonder	.
and	by	the	way	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	take	 shot 	 s 	 	at	old	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	i	want	to	assure	 every 	 body 	 	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	 auto 	 motive 	 	industry	--	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 support 	 ive 	 	of	us	--	that	i	do	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	in	any	way	 compete 	 s 	 	with	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	,	or	 car 	 s 	 	.
but	think	about	where	the	world	is	 to 	 day 	 	.
50	percent	of	the	global	population	now	 live 	 s 	 	in	cities	.
that	's	3.2	billion	people	.
we	've	 solve 	 d 	 	all	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	have	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	to	get	it	to	where	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 s 	 ailing 	 	 ship 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 reli 	 able 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	;	we	found	a	new	continent	.
150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 loco 	 motive 	 s 	 	got	efficient	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 s 	 team 	 	power	,	that	we	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	continent	 in 	 to 	 	a	country	.
over	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	building	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	then	over	the	50	 year 	 s 	 	we	've	 connect 	 ed 	 	every	city	to	every	other	city	in	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	efficient	way	,	and	we	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	standard	of	living	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	that	.
but	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	entire	process	,	more	and	more	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	born	,	and	more	and	more	people	are	moving	to	cities	.
 chin 	 a 	 	 al 	 one 	 	is	going	to	move	four	to	six	hundred	million	people	 in 	 to 	 	cities	in	the	next	decade	and	a	half	.
and	so	,	 no 	 body 	 	,	i	think	,	would	 argu 	 e 	 	that	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	,	in	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	have	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	continent	and	the	country	now	 in 	 to 	 	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
and	if	you	just	look	at	how	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	,	we	've	 solve 	 d 	 	all	the	long	-	range	,	high	-	speed	,	high	-	volume	,	large	-	weight	 problem 	 s 	 	of	moving	 thing 	 s 	 	around	.
 no 	 body 	 	would	want	to	give	them	up	.
and	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	would	n't	want	to	give	up	my	 air 	 plane 	 	,	or	my	helicopter	,	or	my	humvee	,	or	my	porsche	.
i	love	them	all	.	i	do	n't	keep	any	of	them	in	my	living	room	.
the	fact	is	,	the	last	mile	is	the	problem	,	and	half	the	world	now	 live 	 s 	 	in	dense	cities	.
and	people	 s 	 pend 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	who	they	are	,	between	90	and	95	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	 get 	 ting 	 	around	on	foot	.
i	think	there	's	--	i	do	n't	know	what	data	would	impress	you	,	but	how	about	,	43	percent	of	the	 refine 	 d 	 	fuel	 produce 	 d 	 	in	the	world	is	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	 car 	 s 	 	in	 metro 	 politan 	 	 area 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
three	million	people	die	every	year	in	cities	due	to	bad	air	,	and	 al 	 most 	 	all	 p 	 articulate 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	is	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 transport 	 ation 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	cities	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	say	that	not	to	attack	any	industry	,	i	think	--	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	--	i	love	my	 air 	 plane 	 	,	and	 car 	 s 	 	on	 high 	 ways 	 	moving	60	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	are	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	efficient	,	both	from	an	 engineer 	 ing 	 	point	of	view	,	an	energy	consumption	point	of	view	,	and	a	 util 	 ity 	 	point	of	view	.
and	we	all	love	our	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	i	do	.
the	problem	is	,	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	city	and	you	want	to	go	four	 block 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 n 	 either 	 	 f 	 un 	 	nor	efficient	nor	productive	.
it	's	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
if	--	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	in	the	year	1998	,	417	million	people	used	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	;	1.7	million	people	used	 car 	 s 	 	.
if	five	percent	of	that	population	 be 	 came 	 	,	quote	,	middle	class	,	and	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	the	way	we	've	gone	in	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	that	50	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	population	are	moving	 in 	 to 	 	cities	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 	and	density	of	manhattan	,	every	six	 week 	 s 	 	--	it	is	n't	 sustain 	 able 	 	 environment 	 ally 	 	;	it	is	n't	 sustain 	 able 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	--	there	just	ai	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	oil	--	and	it	's	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	 politic 	 ally 	 	.
i	mean	,	what	are	we	 fight 	 ing 	 	over	right	now	?
we	can	make	it	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	but	what	's	the	world	 fight 	 ing 	 	over	right	now	?
so	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	 some 	 body 	 	had	to	work	on	that	last	mile	,	and	it	was	dumb	luck	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	ibots	,	but	once	we	made	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 instant 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	it	could	be	a	great	 alter 	 native 	 	to	jet	 ski 	 s 	 	.	you	do	n't	need	the	water	.
or	 snow 	 mobile 	 s 	 	.	you	do	n't	need	the	snow	.
or	 ski 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	just	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	people	love	to	move	around	 do 	 ing 	 	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	every	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	,	by	the	way	--	just	golf	 cart 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	is	a	multi	-	billion	-	dollar	industry	.
but	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	go	 licens 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	off	,	which	is	what	we	 normal 	 ly 	 	do	,	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	if	we	put	all	our	effort	not	 in 	 to 	 	the	technology	,	but	 in 	 to 	 	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	a	world	that	's	 solve 	 d 	 	all	 it 	 s 	 	other	 problem 	 s 	 	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 how 	 	come	to	accept	that	cities	--	which	,	right	back	from	ancient	greece	on	,	 we 	 re 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	to	walk	around	,	cities	that	 we 	 re 	 	architected	and	built	for	people	--	now	have	a	 foot 	 print 	 	that	,	while	we	've	 solve 	 d 	 	every	other	 transport 	 ation 	 	problem	--	and	it	's	like	moore	's	law	.
i	mean	,	look	at	the	time	it	took	to	cross	a	continent	in	a	conestoga	wagon	,	then	on	a	 rail 	 road 	 	,	then	an	 air 	 plane 	 	.
every	other	form	of	 transport 	 ation 	 	's	 be 	 en 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	.
in	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	gone	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	in	 get 	 ting 	 	around	cities	.
they	've	gotten	 big 	 ger 	 	;	they	're	spread	out	.
the	most	expensive	real	 e 	 state 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	in	every	city	--	wilshire	boulevard	,	or	fifth	 a 	 venue 	 	,	or	tokyo	,	or	paris	--	the	most	expensive	real	 e 	 state 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 down 	 town 	 s 	 	.
65	percent	of	the	 land 	 mass 	 	of	our	cities	are	 park 	 ed 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
the	20	largest	cities	in	the	world	.
so	you	wonder	,	what	if	cities	could	give	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 pedestrian 	 s 	 	what	we	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	now	go	between	cities	?
what	if	you	could	make	them	 f 	 un 	 	,	 attract 	 ive 	 	,	clean	,	 environment 	 ally 	 	friendly	?
what	if	it	would	make	it	a	little	bit	more	 pala 	 table 	 	to	have	access	via	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	that	last	link	to	mass	transit	,	to	get	out	to	your	 car 	 s 	 	so	we	can	all	live	in	the	 suburb 	 s 	 	and	use	our	 car 	 s 	 	the	way	we	want	,	and	then	have	our	cities	 energ 	 ized 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	?
we	thought	it	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	neat	to	do	that	,	and	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	is	:	how	do	we	get	legal	on	the	 side 	 walk 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 technical 	 ly 	 	i	've	got	 motor 	 s 	 	;	i	've	got	 wheel 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	a	motor	vehicle	.
i	do	n't	look	like	a	motor	vehicle	.
i	have	the	same	 foot 	 print 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	pedestrian	;	i	have	the	same	 un 	 ique 	 	 cap 	 ability 	 	to	deal	with	other	 pedestrian 	 s 	 	in	a	 crowd 	 ed 	 	space	.
i	took	 th 	 is 	 	down	to	ground	zero	,	and	 knock 	 ed 	 	my	way	through	 crowd 	 s 	 	for	an	hour	.
i	'm	a	pedestrian	.	but	the	law	 typical 	 ly 	 	 lag 	 s 	 	technology	by	a	generation	or	two	,	and	if	we	get	told	we	do	n't	belong	on	the	 side 	 walk 	 	,	we	have	two	 choice 	 s 	 	.
we	're	a	 re 	 creation 	 al 	 	vehicle	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	,	and	i	do	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	my	time	 do 	 ing 	 	that	kind	of	stuff	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	be	out	in	the	street	in	front	of	a	greyhound	bus	or	a	vehicle	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	so	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	that	,	we	went	to	the	postmaster	general	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	first	person	we	ever	 show 	 ed 	 	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	put	your	people	on	it	.	 every 	 body 	 	 trust 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 post 	 man 	 	.
and	they	belong	on	the	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	,	and	they	'll	use	it	 serious 	 ly 	 	.	``
he	 agree 	 d 	 	.	we	went	to	a	number	of	police	 depart 	 ments 	 	that	want	 the 	 ir 	 	police	 officer 	 s 	 	back	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	on	the	beat	,	 carry 	 ing 	 	70	 pound 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.	they	love	it	.
and	i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	a	 police 	 man 	 	is	going	to	give	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	ticket	.
so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	,	but	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	the	technology	would	not	be	 a 	 s 	 	hard	to	develop	 a 	 s 	 	an	attitude	about	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	how	to	 app 	 ly 	 	the	technology	.
we	went	out	and	we	found	some	 vision 	 ary 	 	people	with	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	let	us	design	and	build	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	in	 hope 	 fully 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	time	to	get	them	 accept 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	happy	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	i	am	happy	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	technology	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	you	want	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	should	all	go	out	and	try	it	.
but	if	i	could	ask	you	to	do	one	thing	,	it	's	not	to	think	about	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	piece	of	technology	,	but	just	imagine	that	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	all	understand	 some 	 how 	 	that	it	's	 reason 	 able 	 	that	we	use	our	4,000	-	pound	machine	,	which	can	go	60	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	that	can	 br 	 ing 	 	you	 every 	 where 	 	you	want	to	go	,	and	 some 	 how 	 	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	what	we	used	for	the	last	mile	,	and	it	's	broken	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
one	of	the	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 occur 	 red 	 	to	us	about	why	it	might	get	 accept 	 ed 	 	,	 happen 	 ed 	 	out	here	in	california	.

 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	little	engine	is	it	'll	burn	any	fuel	,	 be 	 cause 	 	some	of	you	might	be	 skeptic 	 al 	 	about	the	 cap 	 ability 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	to	have	an	impact	,	where	most	of	the	world	you	ca	n't	 simpl 	 y 	 	plug	 in 	 to 	 	your	120	-	volt	 out 	 let 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 alter 	 native 	 	energy	source	,	 start 	 ing 	 	way	back	with	johnson	&	johnson	,	to	run	an	ibot	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	best	 batt 	 eries 	 	you	could	get	--	10	watt	-	 hour 	 s 	 	per	 kilo 	 gram 	 	in	lead	,	20	watt	-	 hour 	 s 	 	per	 kilo 	 gram 	 	nickel	-	cadmium	,	40	watt	-	 hour 	 s 	 	per	 kilo 	 gram 	 	in	nickel	-	metal	 hyd 	 ride 	 	,	60	watt	-	 hour 	 s 	 	per	 kilo 	 gram 	 	in	 lith 	 ium 	 	,	8,750	watt	-	 hour 	 s 	 	of	energy	in	every	 kilo 	 gram 	 	of	 pro 	 pane 	 	or	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	--	which	is	why	 no 	 body 	 	 drive 	 s 	 	electric	 car 	 s 	 	.

it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	much	--	it	 say 	 s 	 	if	you	get	200	 watt 	 s 	 	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	you	'll	get	700	or	800	 watt 	 s 	 	of	heat	.
if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	boil	water	and	re	-	 condens 	 e 	 	it	at	a	rate	of	10	 gallon 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	about	25	,	a	little	over	25.3	kilowatt	--	25,000	 watt 	 s 	 	of	 continu 	 ous 	 	power	--	to	do	it	.
that	's	so	much	energy	,	you	could	n't	afford	to	desalinate	or	clean	water	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	that	way	.
 certain 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	rest	of	the	world	,	your	choice	is	to	 deva 	 state 	 	the	place	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	will	burn	 in 	 to 	 	heat	,	or	drink	the	water	that	's	 avail 	 able 	 	.
the	number	one	cause	of	death	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	among	 human 	 s 	 	is	bad	water	.
 depend 	 ing 	 	on	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 number 	 s 	 	you	 believ 	 e 	 	,	it	's	between	60	and	85,000	people	per	day	.
we	do	n't	need	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	heart	 transplant 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
we	need	water	.
and	women	should	n't	have	to	 s 	 pend 	 	four	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	looking	for	it	,	or	 watch 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	die	.
we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	put	a	vapor	-	 compress 	 ion 	 	 distill 	 er 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	with	a	counter	-	flow	heat	 ex 	 changer 	 	to	take	the	waste	heat	,	then	using	a	little	bit	of	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	control	that	process	,	and	for	450	 watt 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	little	more	than	half	of	 it 	 s 	 	waste	heat	,	it	will	make	10	 gallon 	 s 	 	an	hour	of	 distill 	 ed 	 	water	from	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	to	cool	it	.
