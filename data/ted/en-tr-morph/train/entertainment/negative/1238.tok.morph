what	's	in	the	box	?
 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	must	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 travel 	 ed 	 	with	it	,	 move 	 d 	 	it	,	from	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	to	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	to	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
sound	familiar	?
did	you	know	that	we	americans	have	about	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	space	we	did	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	?
three	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	you	'd	think	,	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	extra	space	,	we	'd	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	room	for	all	our	stuff	.
there	's	a	new	industry	in	town	,	a	22	billion	-	dollar	,	2.2	billion	sq	.	ft.	industry	:	that	of	personal	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	.
so	we	've	got	triple	the	space	,	but	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	good	 s 	 hopper 	 s 	 	that	we	need	even	more	space	.
so	where	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	lead	?
 lot 	 s 	 	of	credit	card	debt	,	huge	 environment 	 al 	 	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	 co 	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	our	happiness	 level 	 s 	 	flat	-	lined	over	the	same	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
well	i	'm	here	to	suggest	there	's	a	better	way	,	that	less	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	equal	more	.
i	bet	most	of	us	have	 experience 	 d 	 	at	some	point	the	 joy 	 s 	 	of	less	:	college	--	in	your	dorm	,	 travel 	 ing 	 	--	in	a	hotel	room	,	 camp 	 ing 	 	--	rig	up	 bas 	 ically 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	boat	.
 what 	 ever 	 	it	was	for	you	,	i	bet	that	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	you	a	little	more	 free 	 dom 	 	,	a	little	more	time	.
so	i	'm	going	to	suggest	that	less	stuff	and	less	space	are	going	to	equal	a	 small 	 er 	 	 foot 	 print 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	great	way	to	 s 	 ave 	 	you	some	money	.
and	it	's	going	to	give	you	a	little	more	ease	in	your	life	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	project	 call 	 ed 	 	life	 edit 	 ed 	 	at	 life 	 edit 	 ed 	 .org 	 	to	further	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	and	to	find	some	great	 solution 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
first	up	:	crowd	-	sourcing	my	420	sq	.	ft.	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	in	manhattan	with	 partner 	 s 	 	mutopo	and	jovoto.com	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	it	all	--	home	 off 	 ice 	 	,	 s 	 it 	 	down	 d 	 inner 	 	for	10	,	room	for	 guest 	 s 	 	,	and	all	my	kite	surfing	gear	.
with	over	300	 ent 	 ries 	 	from	around	the	world	,	i	got	it	,	my	own	little	jewel	box	.
by	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	space	that	was	420	sq	.	ft	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	600	,	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	i	'm	saving	200	grand	.
 small 	 er 	 	space	is	going	to	make	for	 small 	 er 	 	 util 	 ities 	 	--	 s 	 ave 	 	some	more	money	there	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	 small 	 er 	 	 foot 	 print 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	designed	around	an	 edit 	 ed 	 	set	of	 possess 	 ions 	 	--	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	stuff	--	and	 re 	 ally 	 	designed	for	me	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	there	.
so	how	can	you	live	little	?
three	main	 approach 	 es 	 	.
first	of	all	,	you	have	to	edit	 ruth 	 lessly 	 	.
we	've	got	to	clear	the	 arteri 	 es 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	that	shirt	that	i	had	n't	worn	in	 year 	 s 	 	?
it	's	time	for	me	to	let	it	go	.
we	've	got	to	cut	the	 extra 	 ne 	 ous 	 	out	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	we	've	got	to	learn	to	stem	the	 in 	 flow 	 	.
we	need	to	think	before	we	buy	.
ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	``	is	that	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	make	me	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	?	 tru 	 ly 	 	?	``
by	all	 mean 	 s 	 	,	we	should	buy	and	own	some	great	stuff	.
but	we	want	stuff	that	we	're	going	to	love	for	 year 	 s 	 	,	not	just	stuff	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	our	new	 man 	 tra 	 	:	small	is	sexy	.
we	want	space	efficiency	.
we	want	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	designed	for	how	they	're	used	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	time	,	not	that	rare	event	.
why	have	a	six	 burn 	 er 	 	stove	when	you	 rare 	 ly 	 	use	three	?
so	we	want	 thing 	 s 	 	that	nest	,	we	want	 thing 	 s 	 	that	stack	,	and	we	want	it	 digit 	 ized 	 	.
you	can	take	 paper 	 work 	 	,	 book 	 s 	 	,	 movie 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	make	it	disappear	--	it	's	magic	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	want	 multi 	 functional 	 	 space 	 s 	 	and	 house 	 ware 	 s 	 	--	a	sink	 combine 	 d 	 	with	a	toilet	,	a	 din 	 ing 	 	table	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	bed	--	same	space	,	a	little	side	table	 stretch 	 es 	 	out	to	seat	10	.
in	the	winning	life	 edit 	 ed 	 	scheme	in	a	render	here	,	we	combine	a	moving	wall	with	 transform 	 er 	 	furniture	to	get	a	lot	out	of	the	space	.
look	at	the	coffee	table	--	it	 grow 	 s 	 	in	height	and	width	to	seat	10	.
my	 off 	 ice 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	away	,	 eas 	 ily 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	.
my	bed	just	 pop 	 s 	 	out	of	the	wall	with	two	 finger 	 s 	 	.
 guest 	 s 	 	?	move	the	moving	wall	,	have	some	fold	-	down	guest	 bed 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	my	own	movie	theater	.
so	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	all	need	to	live	in	420	sq	.	ft	.
but	consider	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	an	 edit 	 ed 	 	life	.
go	from	3,000	to	2,000	,	from	1,500	to	1,000	.
most	of	us	,	 may 	 be 	 	all	of	us	,	are	here	 pre 	 tty 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	for	a	bunch	of	 day 	 s 	 	with	a	couple	of	 bag 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	small	space	,	a	hotel	room	.
so	when	you	go	home	and	you	walk	through	your	front	door	,	take	a	second	and	ask	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	``	could	i	do	with	a	little	life	 edit 	 ing 	 	?
would	that	give	me	a	little	more	 free 	 dom 	 	?
 may 	 be 	 	a	little	more	time	?	``
what	's	in	the	box	?
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
i	know	i	do	n't	need	it	.
what	's	in	 your 	 s 	 	?
 may 	 be 	 	,	just	 may 	 be 	 	,	less	might	equal	more	.
so	let	's	make	room	for	the	good	stuff	.
thank	you	.
