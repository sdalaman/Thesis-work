i	'm	a	 s 	 av 	 ant 	 	,	or	more	 precise 	 ly 	 	,	a	high	-	 function 	 ing 	 	 aut 	 istic 	 	 s 	 av 	 ant 	 	.
it	's	a	rare	condition	.
and	 rare 	 r 	 	still	when	 accompani 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	my	case	,	by	self	-	 aware 	 ness 	 	and	a	 master 	 y 	 	of	language	.
 ver 	 y 	 	often	when	i	meet	 some 	 one 	 	and	they	learn	 th 	 is 	 	about	me	,	there	's	a	certain	kind	of	 awkward 	 ness 	 	.
i	can	see	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
they	want	to	ask	me	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	in	the	end	,	 quit 	 e 	 	often	,	the	urge	is	 strong 	 er 	 	than	they	are	and	they	 blur 	 t 	 	it	out	:	``	if	i	give	you	my	date	of	birth	,	can	you	tell	me	what	day	of	the	week	i	was	born	on	?	``
or	they	 ment 	 ion 	 	cube	 root 	 s 	 	or	ask	me	to	 re 	 cite 	 	a	long	number	or	long	text	.
i	hope	you	'll	forgive	me	if	i	do	n't	perform	a	kind	of	one	-	man	 s 	 av 	 ant 	 	show	for	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	 in 	 stead 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	far	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	than	 date 	 s 	 	of	birth	or	cube	 root 	 s 	 	--	a	little	 deep 	 er 	 	and	a	lot	 close 	 r 	 	,	to	my	mind	,	than	work	.
i	want	to	talk	to	you	 brief 	 ly 	 	about	 per 	 ception 	 	.
when	he	was	writing	the	 play 	 s 	 	and	the	short	 st 	 ories 	 	that	would	make	his	name	,	anton	chekhov	 ke 	 pt 	 	a	 note 	 book 	 	in	which	he	 not 	 ed 	 	down	his	 observ 	 ations 	 	of	the	world	around	him	--	little	 detail 	 s 	 	that	other	people	seem	to	 mis 	 s 	 	.
every	time	i	read	chekhov	and	his	 un 	 ique 	 	vision	of	human	life	,	i	'm	 re 	 minded 	 	of	why	i	too	 be 	 came 	 	a	writer	.
in	my	 book 	 s 	 	,	i	explore	the	nature	of	 per 	 ception 	 	and	how	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	create	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 know 	 ing 	 	and	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
here	are	three	 question 	 s 	 	drawn	from	my	work	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	try	to	figure	them	out	,	i	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	consider	for	a	moment	the	 intuit 	 ions 	 	and	the	gut	 instinct 	 s 	 	that	are	going	through	your	head	and	your	heart	 a 	 s 	 	you	look	at	them	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 calcul 	 ation 	 	:	can	you	feel	where	on	the	number	line	the	solution	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	fall	?
or	look	at	the	foreign	word	and	the	 sound 	 s 	 	:	can	you	get	a	sense	of	the	range	of	 meaning 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 point 	 ing 	 	you	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	?
and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	line	of	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	the	poet	use	the	word	 ha 	 re 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 rabbi 	 t 	 	?
i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	our	personal	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	,	you	see	,	are	at	the	heart	of	how	we	 acquir 	 e 	 	knowledge	.
aesthetic	 judgment 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	abstract	 reason 	 ing 	 	,	guide	and	shape	the	process	by	which	we	all	come	to	know	what	we	know	.
i	'm	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
my	 world 	 s 	 	of	 word 	 s 	 	and	 number 	 s 	 	blur	with	color	,	emotion	and	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	juan	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	the	condition	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	call	 synest 	 hesia 	 	,	an	 un 	 usual 	 	cross	-	talk	between	the	 sense 	 s 	 	.
here	are	the	 number 	 s 	 	one	to	12	 a 	 s 	 	i	see	them	--	every	number	with	 it 	 s 	 	own	shape	and	character	.
one	is	a	flash	of	white	light	.
six	is	a	 tin 	 y 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	black	hole	.
the	 sketch 	 es 	 	are	in	black	and	white	here	,	but	in	my	mind	they	have	 color 	 s 	 	.
three	is	green	.
four	is	blue	.
five	is	yellow	.
i	paint	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	here	is	one	of	my	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 multi 	 plic 	 ation 	 	of	two	prime	 number 	 s 	 	.
three	-	dimensional	 shape 	 s 	 	and	the	space	they	create	in	the	middle	 create 	 s 	 	a	new	shape	,	the	answer	to	the	sum	.
what	about	 big 	 ger 	 	 number 	 s 	 	?
well	you	ca	n't	get	much	 big 	 ger 	 	than	pi	,	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	constant	.
it	's	an	infinite	number	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	 go 	 es 	 	on	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	that	i	made	of	the	first	20	 decimal 	 s 	 	of	pi	,	i	take	the	 color 	 s 	 	and	the	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	the	 text 	 ures 	 	and	i	pull	them	all	together	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	 roll 	 ing 	 	 numeric 	 al 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
but	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 number 	 s 	 	that	i	see	in	 color 	 s 	 	.
 word 	 s 	 	too	,	for	me	,	have	 color 	 s 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	 text 	 ures 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 open 	 ing 	 	phrase	from	the	novel	``	lolita	.	``
and	nabokov	was	 him 	 self 	 	 synest 	 hetic 	 	.
and	you	can	see	here	how	my	 per 	 ception 	 	of	the	sound	l	 help 	 s 	 	the	 all 	 iteration 	 	to	jump	right	out	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	a	little	bit	more	 mathematic 	 al 	 	.
and	i	wonder	if	some	of	you	will	notice	the	construction	of	the	sentence	from	``	the	great	gatsby	.	``
there	is	a	 process 	 ion 	 	of	 syllable 	 s 	 	--	wheat	,	one	;	 prairie 	 s 	 	,	two	;	lost	swede	 town 	 s 	 	,	three	--	one	,	two	,	three	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	effect	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	on	the	mind	,	and	it	 help 	 s 	 	the	sentence	to	feel	right	.
let	's	go	back	to	the	 question 	 s 	 	i	posed	you	a	moment	ago	.
64	 multi 	 plied 	 	by	75	.
if	some	of	you	play	 ches 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	know	that	64	is	a	square	number	,	and	that	's	why	 ches 	 s 	 board 	 s 	 	,	eight	by	eight	,	have	64	 square 	 s 	 	.
so	that	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	form	that	we	can	picture	,	that	we	can	perceive	.
what	about	75	?
well	if	100	,	if	we	think	of	100	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	like	a	square	,	75	would	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	what	we	need	to	do	now	is	put	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 picture 	 s 	 	together	in	our	mind	--	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
64	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	6,400	.
and	in	the	right	-	hand	corner	,	you	do	n't	have	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
four	 a 	 cross 	 	,	four	up	and	down	--	it	's	16	.
so	what	the	sum	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	to	do	is	16	,	16	,	16	.
that	's	a	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	than	the	way	that	the	school	taught	you	to	do	math	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	.
it	's	16	,	16	,	16	,	48	,	4,800	--	4,800	,	the	answer	to	the	sum	.
easy	when	you	know	how	.
the	second	question	was	an	icelandic	word	.
i	'm	 assum 	 ing 	 	there	are	not	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	who	speak	icelandic	.
so	let	me	narrow	the	 choice 	 s 	 	down	to	two	.
hnugginn	:	is	it	a	happy	word	,	or	a	 s 	 ad 	 	word	?
what	do	you	say	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
some	people	say	it	's	happy	.
most	people	,	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	people	,	say	 s 	 ad 	 	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	.
why	do	,	 statistic 	 ally 	 	,	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	people	say	that	a	word	is	 s 	 ad 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	heavy	in	other	 case 	 s 	 	?
in	my	 theor 	 y 	 	,	language	 evolve 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	 sound 	 s 	 	match	,	correspond	with	,	the	 subject 	 ive 	 	,	with	the	personal	,	intuitive	experience	of	the	 listen 	 er 	 	.
let	's	have	a	look	at	the	third	question	.
it	's	a	line	from	a	poem	by	john	keats	.
 word 	 s 	 	,	like	 number 	 s 	 	,	express	fundamental	 relationship 	 s 	 	between	 object 	 s 	 	and	 event 	 s 	 	and	 force 	 s 	 	that	constitute	our	world	.
it	 stand 	 s 	 	to	reason	that	we	,	 exist 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	should	in	the	course	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	absorb	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
and	 poet 	 s 	 	,	like	other	 artist 	 s 	 	,	play	with	 t 	 hose 	 	intuitive	 understand 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
in	the	case	of	 ha 	 re 	 	,	it	's	an	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	sound	in	english	.
it	can	 al 	 so 	 	mean	the	 fiber 	 s 	 	that	grow	from	a	head	.
and	if	we	think	of	that	--	let	me	put	the	picture	up	--	the	 fiber 	 s 	 	represent	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.
they	yield	to	the	 s 	 light 	 est 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	or	motion	or	emotion	.
so	what	you	have	is	an	atmosphere	of	 vulner 	 ability 	 	and	tension	.
the	 ha 	 re 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	the	animal	--	not	a	cat	,	not	a	dog	,	a	 ha 	 re 	 	--	why	a	 ha 	 re 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	think	of	the	picture	--	not	the	word	,	the	picture	.
the	 over 	 long 	 	 ear 	 s 	 	,	the	 over 	 large 	 	feet	,	 help 	 s 	 	us	to	picture	,	to	feel	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	,	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	 l 	 imp 	 	and	to	 trem 	 ble 	 	.
so	in	these	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	hope	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	share	a	little	bit	of	my	vision	of	 thing 	 s 	 	and	to	show	you	that	 word 	 s 	 	can	have	 color 	 s 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	 number 	 s 	 	,	 shape 	 s 	 	and	 personal 	 ities 	 	.
the	world	is	 rich 	 er 	 	,	 vast 	 er 	 	than	it	too	often	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	.
i	hope	that	i	've	 give 	 n 	 	you	the	 desir 	 e 	 	to	learn	to	see	the	world	with	new	 eye 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
