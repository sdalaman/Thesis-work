i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	share	 some 	 thing 	 	with	you	i	have	n't	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 prob 	 ably 	 	in	more	than	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	bear	with	me	 a 	 s 	 	i	take	you	through	 th 	 is 	 	journey	.
when	i	was	22	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	came	home	from	work	,	put	a	leash	on	my	dog	and	went	for	my	usual	run	.
i	had	no	idea	that	at	that	moment	my	life	was	going	to	change	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
while	i	was	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	my	dog	for	the	run	,	a	man	was	 finish 	 ing 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	at	a	bar	,	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	his	car	 key 	 s 	 	,	got	 in 	 to 	 	a	car	and	headed	south	,	or	 where 	 ver 	 	he	was	.
i	was	running	 a 	 cross 	 	the	street	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	remember	is	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	a	grenade	went	off	in	my	head	.
and	i	remember	 put 	 ting 	 	my	 hand 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	my	life	's	blood	 empty 	 ing 	 	out	of	my	neck	and	my	mouth	.
what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	he	ran	a	red	light	and	hit	me	and	my	dog	.
she	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 under 	 neath 	 	the	car	.
i	flew	out	in	front	of	the	car	,	and	then	he	ran	over	my	 leg 	 s 	 	.
my	left	leg	got	caught	up	in	the	wheel	well	--	 s 	 pun 	 	it	around	.
the	 bump 	 er 	 	of	the	car	hit	my	throat	,	 s 	 lic 	 ing 	 	it	open	.
i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	blunt	chest	trauma	.
your	aorta	 come 	 s 	 	up	 be 	 hind 	 	your	heart	.
it	's	your	major	 art 	 ery 	 	,	and	it	was	 s 	 ever 	 ed 	 	,	so	my	blood	was	 gur 	 gling 	 	out	of	my	mouth	.
it	 foam 	 ed 	 	,	and	 horr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
i	had	no	idea	what	was	going	on	,	but	 strange 	 rs 	 	 inter 	 vene 	 d 	 	,	 ke 	 pt 	 	my	heart	moving	,	 beat 	 ing 	 	.
i	say	moving	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 qui 	 ver 	 ing 	 	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	a	beat	back	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
 some 	 body 	 	was	smart	and	put	a	bic	pen	in	my	neck	to	open	up	my	 air 	 way 	 	so	that	i	could	get	some	air	in	there	.
and	my	lung	 collapse 	 d 	 	,	so	 some 	 body 	 	cut	me	open	and	put	a	pin	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	to	stop	that	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	event	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 some 	 how 	 	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	at	the	hospital	.
i	was	 wrap 	 ped 	 	in	ice	and	then	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	put	 in 	 to 	 	a	drug	-	induced	 com 	 a 	 	.
18	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	.
i	was	blind	,	i	could	n't	speak	,	and	i	could	n't	walk	.
i	was	64	 lb 	 s 	 	.
the	hospital	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	no	idea	what	to	do	with	people	like	that	.
and	in	fact	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	call	me	a	gomer	.
that	's	 an 	 other 	 	story	we	wo	n't	even	get	 in 	 to 	 	.
i	had	so	 man 	 y 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	to	put	my	neck	back	together	,	to	repair	my	heart	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	.
some	 thing 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	,	some	 thing 	 s 	 	did	n't	.
i	had	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 titan 	 ium 	 	put	in	me	,	cadaver	 bone 	 s 	 	to	try	to	get	my	feet	moving	the	right	way	.
and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	a	plastic	nose	,	 por 	 ce 	 lain 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	human	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	it	's	hard	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	to	talk	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	so	bear	with	me	.
i	had	more	than	50	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	.
but	who	's	 count 	 ing 	 	?
so	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	the	hospital	 decide 	 d 	 	it	was	time	for	me	to	go	.
they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	open	up	space	for	 some 	 body 	 	else	that	they	thought	could	come	back	from	 what 	 ever 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	through	.
 every 	 body 	 	lost	faith	in	me	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 re 	 cover 	 	.
so	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	put	a	map	up	on	the	wall	,	threw	a	 d 	 art 	 	,	and	it	 land 	 ed 	 	at	a	senior	home	here	in	colorado	.
and	i	know	all	of	you	are	 scratch 	 ing 	 	your	head	:	``	a	senior	 citizen 	 s 	 	'	home	?	what	in	the	world	are	you	going	to	do	there	?	``
but	if	you	think	about	all	of	the	 skill 	 s 	 	and	talent	that	are	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	right	now	,	that	's	what	a	senior	home	 ha 	 s 	 	.
so	there	 we 	 re 	 	all	these	 skill 	 s 	 	and	 talent 	 s 	 	that	these	 senior 	 s 	 	had	.
the	one	advantage	that	they	had	over	most	of	you	is	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	a	long	life	.
and	i	 need 	 ed 	 	that	 wis 	 dom 	 	at	that	moment	in	my	life	.
but	imagine	what	it	was	like	for	them	when	i	 show 	 ed 	 	up	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 door 	 step 	 	?
at	that	point	,	i	had	 gain 	 ed 	 	four	 pound 	 s 	 	,	so	i	was	68	 lb 	 s 	 	.
i	was	bald	.
i	was	 wear 	 ing 	 	hospital	 scrub 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 body 	 	 don 	 ated 	 	tennis	 shoe 	 s 	 	for	me	.
and	i	had	a	white	 can 	 e 	 	in	one	hand	and	a	 suit 	 case 	 	full	of	medical	 record 	 s 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	hand	.
and	so	the	senior	 citizen 	 s 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	have	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
so	they	 pull 	 ed 	 	back	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	each	other	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	what	 skill 	 s 	 	do	we	have	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	?
 th 	 is 	 	kid	 need 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	work	.	``
so	they	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 match 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 talent 	 s 	 	and	 skill 	 s 	 	to	all	of	my	 need 	 s 	 	.
but	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	assess	what	i	 need 	 ed 	 	right	away	.
i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	eat	like	a	normal	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	since	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	eating	through	a	tube	in	my	chest	and	through	my	 vein 	 s 	 	.
so	i	had	to	go	through	 try 	 ing 	 	to	eat	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	they	went	through	that	process	.
and	then	they	had	to	figure	out	:	``	well	she	 need 	 s 	 	furniture	.
she	is	 sleep 	 ing 	 	in	the	corner	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.	``
so	they	went	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	 lock 	 ers 	 	and	all	 gather 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	extra	furniture	--	 g 	 ave 	 	me	 pot 	 s 	 	and	 pan 	 s 	 	,	 blank 	 et 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	next	thing	that	i	 need 	 ed 	 	was	a	 make 	 over 	 	.
so	out	went	the	green	 scrub 	 s 	 	and	in	came	the	 pol 	 yester 	 	and	 flor 	 al 	 	 print 	 s 	 	.
we	're	not	going	to	talk	about	the	 hair 	 style 	 s 	 	that	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	force	on	me	once	my	hair	grew	back	.
but	i	did	say	no	to	the	blue	hair	.
so	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	what	went	on	is	they	 decide 	 d 	 	that	,	well	i	need	to	learn	to	speak	.
so	you	ca	n't	be	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	person	if	you	're	not	able	to	speak	and	ca	n't	see	.
so	they	 figur 	 ed 	 	not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	see	is	one	thing	,	but	they	need	to	get	me	to	talk	.
so	while	sally	,	the	 off 	 ice 	 	 manage 	 r 	 	,	was	 teach 	 ing 	 	me	to	speak	in	the	day	--	it	's	hard	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	're	a	kid	,	you	take	 thing 	 s 	 	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
you	learn	 thing 	 s 	 	 un 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	.
but	for	me	,	i	was	an	adult	and	it	was	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	had	to	learn	how	to	coordinate	my	new	throat	with	my	tongue	and	my	new	 tee 	 th 	 	and	my	lips	,	and	capture	the	air	and	get	the	word	out	.
so	i	 act 	 ed 	 	like	a	two	-	year	-	old	and	 re 	 fused 	 	to	work	.
but	the	men	had	a	better	idea	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	make	it	 f 	 un 	 	for	me	.
so	they	 we 	 re 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	me	 cus 	 s 	 	word	scrabble	at	night	,	and	then	,	 secret 	 ly 	 	,	how	to	 s 	 wear 	 	like	a	 sail 	 or 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	just	 leav 	 e 	 	it	to	your	 imagin 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	my	first	 word 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	when	sally	 final 	 ly 	 	got	my	confidence	built	.
so	i	 move 	 d 	 	on	from	there	.
and	a	 form 	 er 	 	teacher	who	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	have	alzheimer	's	took	on	the	task	of	 teach 	 ing 	 	me	to	write	.
the	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ancy 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	good	for	me	.
so	we	'll	just	keep	moving	on	.
one	of	the	 pivot 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	for	me	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	cross	a	street	 aga 	 in 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	blind	person	.
so	close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
now	imagine	you	have	to	cross	a	street	.
you	do	n't	know	how	far	that	street	is	and	you	do	n't	know	if	you	're	going	straight	and	you	hear	 car 	 s 	 	 whiz 	 z 	 ing 	 	back	and	forth	,	and	you	had	a	 horr 	 ible 	 	accident	that	 land 	 ed 	 	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
so	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 obstacle 	 s 	 	i	had	to	get	through	.
one	was	post	-	 trauma 	 tic 	 	stress	 dis 	 order 	 	.
and	every	time	i	 approach 	 ed 	 	the	corner	or	the	 cur 	 b 	 	i	would	panic	.
and	the	second	one	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	cross	that	street	.
so	one	of	the	 senior 	 s 	 	just	came	up	to	me	,	and	she	 push 	 ed 	 	me	up	to	the	corner	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	when	you	think	it	's	time	to	go	,	just	stick	the	 can 	 e 	 	out	there	.
if	it	's	hit	,	do	n't	cross	the	street	.	``
made	perfect	sense	.
but	by	the	third	 can 	 e 	 	that	went	 whiz 	 z 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	road	,	they	 real 	 ized 	 	that	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	put	the	 resource 	 s 	 	together	,	and	they	raised	 fund 	 s 	 	so	that	i	could	go	to	the	braille	institute	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	gain	the	 skill 	 s 	 	to	be	a	blind	person	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	go	get	a	guide	dog	who	 transform 	 ed 	 	my	life	.
and	i	was	able	to	return	to	college	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	senior	 citizen 	 s 	 	who	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	me	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	guide	dog	and	skill	set	i	had	 gain 	 ed 	 	.
10	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	i	 gain 	 ed 	 	my	sight	back	.
not	 magic 	 ally 	 	.
i	 opt 	 ed 	 	in	for	three	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	,	and	one	of	them	was	 experiment 	 al 	 	.
it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	robotic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
they	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	a	 hemato 	 ma 	 	from	 be 	 hind 	 	my	eye	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	change	for	me	was	that	the	world	 move 	 d 	 	forward	,	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	new	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	,	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	blind	person	,	your	visual	 memor 	 y 	 	 fad 	 es 	 	and	is	 replace 	 d 	 	with	how	you	feel	about	 thing 	 s 	 	and	how	 thing 	 s 	 	sound	and	how	 thing 	 s 	 	smell	.
so	one	day	i	was	in	my	room	and	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	my	room	and	i	thought	it	was	a	 mon 	 ster 	 	.
so	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	it	.
and	i	go	,	``	i	'm	just	going	to	touch	it	.	``
and	i	 touch 	 ed 	 	it	and	i	went	,	``	oh	my	god	,	it	's	a	 laundr 	 y 	 	basket	.	``
so	 every 	 thing 	 	is	different	when	you	're	a	 sight 	 ed 	 	person	 be 	 cause 	 	you	take	that	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
but	when	you	're	blind	,	you	have	the	 tact 	 ile 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	for	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	change	for	me	was	looking	down	at	my	 hand 	 s 	 	and	 see 	 ing 	 	that	i	'd	lost	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	my	life	.
i	thought	that	time	had	stood	still	for	some	reason	and	 move 	 d 	 	on	for	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	.
but	when	i	 look 	 ed 	 	down	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	time	 march 	 ed 	 	on	for	me	too	and	that	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	caught	up	,	so	i	got	going	on	it	.
we	did	n't	have	 word 	 s 	 	like	crowd	-	sourcing	and	radical	 collabor 	 ation 	 	when	i	had	my	accident	.
but	the	 con 	 cept 	 	held	true	--	people	 work 	 ing 	 	with	people	to	 re 	 build 	 	me	;	people	 work 	 ing 	 	with	people	to	re	-	 educ 	 ate 	 	me	.
i	would	n't	be	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	if	it	was	n't	for	 extrem 	 e 	 	radical	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
thank	you	so	much	.
