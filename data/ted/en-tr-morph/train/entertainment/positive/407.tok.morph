andy	hobsbawm	:	we	've	got	the	science	,	we	've	had	the	debate	.
the	moral	 imper 	 ative 	 	is	on	the	table	.
great	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	 need 	 ed 	 	to	take	it	all	,	make	it	simple	and	sharp	.
to	make	it	connect	.	to	make	it	make	people	want	to	act	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	call	,	a	 ple 	 a 	 	,	to	the	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 talent 	 ed 	 	ted	community	.
let	's	get	creative	against	climate	change	.
