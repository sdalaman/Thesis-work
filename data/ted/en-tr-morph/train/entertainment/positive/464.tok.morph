chris	anderson	:	let	's	now	see	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	speech	that	we	 capture 	 d 	 	a	couple	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
jose	antonio	abreu	:	my	dear	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	i	am	 over 	 joy 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	at	 be 	 ing 	 	 a 	 ward 	 ed 	 	the	ted	prize	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	all	the	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	music	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 educ 	 ators 	 	from	venezuela	who	have	 self 	 lessly 	 	and	 loyal 	 ly 	 	 accompani 	 ed 	 	me	for	35	 year 	 s 	 	in	 found 	 ing 	 	,	growing	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	in	venezuela	the	national	system	of	youth	and	children	's	 orchestra 	 s 	 	and	 choir 	 s 	 	.
since	i	was	a	boy	,	in	my	early	 child 	 hood 	 	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 music 	 ian 	 	,	and	,	thank	god	,	i	made	it	.
from	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	my	family	and	my	community	,	i	had	all	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	support	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 music 	 ian 	 	.
all	my	life	i	've	 dream 	 ed 	 	that	all	venezuelan	children	have	the	same	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	that	i	had	.
from	that	 desir 	 e 	 	and	from	my	heart	 stem 	 med 	 	the	idea	to	make	music	a	deep	and	global	 re 	 ality 	 	for	my	country	.
from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 rehears 	 al 	 	,	i	saw	the	bright	future	 a 	 head 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 rehears 	 al 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	a	great	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	me	.
i	had	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	 don 	 ation 	 	of	50	music	 stand 	 s 	 	to	be	used	by	100	 boy 	 s 	 	in	that	 rehears 	 al 	 	.
when	i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	the	 rehears 	 al 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	11	 kid 	 s 	 	had	 show 	 n 	 	up	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	do	i	close	the	program	or	 multi 	 ply 	 	these	 kid 	 s 	 	?	``
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	face	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	and	on	that	same	night	,	i	 promise 	 d 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	11	children	i	'd	turn	our	orchestra	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
two	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	that	promise	i	made	,	when	a	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	english	critic	 publish 	 ed 	 	an	article	in	the	london	 time 	 s 	 	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	who	could	be	the	winner	of	the	orchestra	world	cup	.
he	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	four	great	world	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	and	the	fifth	one	was	venezuela	's	youth	 sym 	 phony 	 	orchestra	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	can	say	that	art	in	latin	america	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	 monopol 	 y 	 	of	 elite 	 s 	 	and	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	social	right	,	a	right	for	all	the	people	.
child	:	there	is	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	here	between	 class 	 es 	 	,	nor	white	or	black	,	nor	if	you	have	money	or	not	.
 simpl 	 y 	 	,	if	you	are	 talent 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	have	the	 voc 	 ation 	 	and	the	will	to	be	here	,	you	get	in	.	you	share	with	us	and	make	music	.
ja	:	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 re 	 cent 	 	tour	by	the	simon	bolivar	youth	orchestra	of	venezuela	of	u.s.	and	europe	,	we	saw	how	our	music	 move 	 d 	 	young	 audience 	 s 	 	to	the	bottom	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 soul 	 s 	 	,	how	children	and	 adolescent 	 s 	 	 rush 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	stage	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	 jacket 	 s 	 	from	our	 music 	 ians 	 	,	how	the	 stand 	 ing 	 	 ov 	 ations 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	30	 minute 	 s 	 	long	,	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	last	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	and	how	the	public	,	after	the	concert	was	over	,	went	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	street	to	greet	our	young	people	in	triumph	.
 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	an	 art 	 istic 	 	triumph	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 sympath 	 y 	 	between	the	public	of	the	most	 advance 	 d 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	of	the	world	and	the	musical	youth	of	latin	america	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	in	venezuela	,	giving	these	 audience 	 s 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	of	music	,	 vital 	 ity 	 	,	energy	,	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	and	strength	.
in	 it 	 s 	 	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	are	much	more	than	 art 	 istic 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	of	social	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	to	 s 	 ing 	 	and	to	play	together	 mean 	 s 	 	to	 intima 	 te 	 ly 	 	 co 	 exist 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 perfect 	 ion 	 	and	excellence	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	a	strict	discipline	of	 organ 	 ization 	 	and	 coordi 	 nation 	 	in	order	to	seek	the	 harmon 	 ic 	 	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	of	 voice 	 s 	 	and	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
that	's	how	they	build	a	spirit	of	 solid 	 arity 	 	and	 fratern 	 ity 	 	among	them	,	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	self	-	esteem	and	foster	the	 ethic 	 al 	 	and	 aesthetic 	 al 	 	 value 	 s 	 	related	to	the	music	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	music	is	 immense 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	the	 awake 	 ning 	 	of	 sens 	 ibility 	 	,	in	the	 for 	 ging 	 	of	 value 	 s 	 	and	in	the	training	of	 young 	 sters 	 	to	teach	other	 kid 	 s 	 	.
child	:	after	all	 th 	 is 	 	time	here	,	music	is	life	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	else	.
music	is	life	.
ja	:	each	teenager	and	child	in	el	sistema	 ha 	 s 	 	his	own	story	,	and	they	are	all	 import 	 ant 	 	and	of	great	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	to	me	.
let	me	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	case	of	edicson	ruiz	.
he	is	a	boy	from	a	 par 	 ish 	 	in	caracas	who	 passionate 	 ly 	 	 attend 	 ed 	 	to	his	double	 bas 	 s 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	at	the	san	agustin	's	 juni 	 or 	 	orchestra	.
with	his	effort	,	and	the	support	of	his	mother	,	his	family	and	his	community	,	he	 be 	 came 	 	a	principal	member	in	the	double	 bas 	 s 	 	segment	of	the	berlin	 phil 	 harmon 	 ic 	 	orchestra	.
we	have	 an 	 other 	 	well	-	known	case	--	gustavo	dudamel	.
he	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	boy	member	of	the	children	's	orchestra	in	his	 home 	 town 	 	,	barquisimeto	.
there	,	he	grew	 a 	 s 	 	a	 viol 	 in 	 ist 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	conductor	.
he	 be 	 came 	 	the	conductor	of	venezuela	's	 juni 	 or 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	 conduct 	 s 	 	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	.
he	is	the	musical	director	of	los	angeles	 phil 	 harmon 	 ic 	 	,	and	is	still	the	 over 	 all 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	of	venezuela	's	 juni 	 or 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	.
he	was	the	conductor	of	the	gothenburg	 sym 	 phony 	 	orchestra	,	and	he	's	an	 un 	 beat 	 able 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	for	young	 music 	 ians 	 	in	latin	america	and	the	world	.
the	structure	of	el	sistema	is	based	on	a	new	and	 flex 	 ible 	 	 man 	 aging 	 	style	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	the	 feature 	 s 	 	of	each	community	and	region	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	 attend 	 s 	 	to	300,000	children	of	the	lower	and	middle	class	all	over	venezuela	.
it	's	a	program	of	social	 rescu 	 e 	 	and	deep	cultural	 transform 	 ation 	 	designed	for	the	whole	venezuelan	 socie 	 ty 	 	with	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 distinct 	 ions 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	,	but	 emphas 	 izing 	 	the	 vulner 	 able 	 	and	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	social	 group 	 s 	 	.
the	effect	of	el	sistema	is	felt	in	three	fundamental	 circle 	 s 	 	:	in	the	personal	/	social	circle	,	in	the	family	circle	and	in	the	community	.
in	the	personal	/	social	circle	,	the	children	in	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	and	 choir 	 s 	 	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	intellectual	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	side	.
the	music	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	source	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	thus	 elev 	 ating 	 	the	spirit	and	 lead 	 ing 	 	man	to	a	full	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	his	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
so	,	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	and	intellectual	 profit 	 s 	 	are	huge	--	the	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 teach 	 ing 	 	and	training	 principle 	 s 	 	,	the	sense	of	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	and	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	to	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	the	individual	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	great	 collect 	 ive 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	self	-	esteem	and	confidence	.
mother	teresa	of	calcutta	 insist 	 ed 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	me	:	the	most	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	and	tragic	thing	about	poverty	is	not	the	lack	of	bread	or	roof	,	but	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	no	-	one	--	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 any 	 one 	 	,	the	lack	of	 ident 	 ification 	 	,	the	lack	of	public	esteem	.
that	's	why	the	child	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	 provide 	 s 	 	him	with	a	noble	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	 make 	 s 	 	him	a	role	model	for	his	family	and	community	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	him	a	better	student	at	school	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 inspire 	 s 	 	in	him	a	sense	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	 persever 	 ance 	 	and	 punctu 	 ality 	 	that	will	 great 	 ly 	 	help	him	at	school	.
 with 	 in 	 	the	family	,	the	 parent 	 s 	 	'	support	is	 un 	 condition 	 al 	 	.
the	child	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	role	model	for	both	his	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	a	poor	child	.
once	the	child	 discover 	 s 	 	he	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	his	family	,	he	 begin 	 s 	 	to	seek	new	ways	of	 improv 	 ing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	and	 hope 	 s 	 	better	for	 him 	 self 	 	and	his	community	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	he	 hope 	 s 	 	for	social	and	economic	 improve 	 ments 	 	for	his	own	family	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	up	a	 construct 	 ive 	 	and	 ascend 	 ing 	 	social	dynamic	.
the	large	 major 	 ity 	 	of	our	children	belong	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 al 	 ready 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	to	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	 strat 	 a 	 	of	the	venezuelan	population	.
that	 encourag 	 es 	 	them	to	embrace	new	 dream 	 s 	 	,	new	 goal 	 s 	 	,	and	progress	in	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	music	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	circle	of	the	community	,	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	prove	to	be	the	creative	 space 	 s 	 	of	culture	and	 source 	 s 	 	of	 ex 	 change 	 	and	new	 meaning 	 s 	 	.
the	 spontane 	 ity 	 	music	 ha 	 s 	 	 exclude 	 s 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 luxur 	 y 	 	item	and	 make 	 s 	 	it	a	 pa 	 trim 	 ony 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
it	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	a	child	play	a	 viol 	 in 	 	at	home	,	while	his	father	 work 	 s 	 	in	his	 carp 	 entry 	 	.
it	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	a	little	girl	play	the	 clar 	 inet 	 	at	home	,	while	her	mother	 do 	 es 	 	the	 house 	 work 	 	.
the	idea	is	that	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	join	with	 pri 	 de 	 	and	joy	in	the	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	and	the	 choir 	 s 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	belong	to	.
the	huge	spiritual	world	that	music	 produce 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 self 	 	,	which	 al 	 so 	 	lies	 with 	 in 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	 end 	 s 	 	up	 over 	 coming 	 	material	poverty	.
from	the	minute	a	child	's	taught	how	to	play	an	instrument	,	he	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	poor	.
he	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	child	in	progress	 head 	 ing 	 	for	a	professional	level	,	who	'll	 lat 	 er 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	full	citizen	.
 needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	that	music	is	the	number	one	 prevent 	 ion 	 	against	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	,	violence	,	bad	 habit 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	in	the	life	of	a	child	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	historian	arnold	toynbee	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	world	was	 suffer 	 ing 	 	a	huge	spiritual	crisis	.
not	an	economic	or	social	crisis	,	but	a	spiritual	one	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	to	confront	 s 	 uch 	 	a	crisis	,	 on 	 ly 	 	art	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	can	give	proper	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 human 	 ity 	 	,	to	 man 	 kind 	 	's	 deep 	 est 	 	 aspir 	 ations 	 	,	and	to	the	historic	 demand 	 s 	 	of	our	 time 	 s 	 	.
education	--	the	synthesis	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	knowledge	--	is	the	 mean 	 s 	 	to	 striv 	 e 	 	for	a	more	perfect	,	more	aware	,	more	noble	and	more	just	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
with	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	we	pay	 pro 	 found 	 	 respect 	 s 	 	to	ted	for	 it 	 s 	 	 out 	 stand 	 ing 	 	 human 	 ism 	 	,	the	scope	of	 it 	 s 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	,	for	 it 	 s 	 	open	and	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	 pro 	 motion 	 	of	young	 value 	 s 	 	.
we	hope	that	ted	can	 con 	 tribute 	 	in	a	full	and	fundamental	way	to	the	building	of	 th 	 is 	 	new	era	in	the	 teach 	 ing 	 	of	music	,	in	which	the	social	,	 commun 	 al 	 	,	spiritual	and	 vindic 	 atory 	 	 aim 	 s 	 	of	the	child	and	the	adolescent	 be 	 come 	 	a	beacon	and	a	goal	for	a	vast	social	mission	.
