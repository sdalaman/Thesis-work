how	 do 	 es 	 	the	news	shape	the	way	we	see	the	world	?
here	's	the	world	based	on	the	way	it	 look 	 s 	 	--	based	on	 land 	 mass 	 	.
and	here	's	how	news	 shape 	 s 	 	what	americans	see	.
 th 	 is 	 	map	--	--	 th 	 is 	 	map	 show 	 s 	 	the	number	of	 second 	 s 	 	that	american	network	and	cable	news	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	news	 st 	 ories 	 	,	by	country	,	in	february	of	2007	--	just	one	year	ago	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	month	when	north	korea	 agree 	 d 	 	to	dismantle	 it 	 s 	 	nuclear	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
there	was	massive	 flood 	 ing 	 	in	indonesia	.
and	in	paris	,	the	ipcc	released	 it 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 confirm 	 ing 	 	man	's	impact	on	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
the	u.s.	 account 	 ed 	 	for	79	percent	of	total	news	 cover 	 age 	 	.
and	when	we	take	out	the	u.s.	and	look	at	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	21	percent	,	we	see	a	lot	of	 ir 	 aq 	 	--	that	's	that	big	green	thing	there	--	and	little	else	.
the	 combine 	 d 	 	 cover 	 age 	 	of	russia	,	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 reach 	 ed 	 	just	one	percent	.
when	we	 analyz 	 ed 	 	all	the	news	 st 	 ories 	 	and	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	just	one	story	,	here	's	how	the	world	 look 	 ed 	 	.
what	was	that	story	?	the	death	of	anna	nicole	smith	.
 th 	 is 	 	story	 eclipse 	 d 	 	every	country	 ex 	 cept 	 	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	and	 receiv 	 ed 	 	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	 cover 	 age 	 	of	the	ipcc	report	.
and	the	cycle	 continu 	 es 	 	;	 a 	 s 	 	we	all	know	,	britney	 ha 	 s 	 	 loom 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	large	 late 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	why	do	n't	we	hear	more	about	the	world	?
one	reason	is	that	news	 network 	 s 	 	have	 reduc 	 ed 	 	the	number	of	 the 	 ir 	 	foreign	 bureau 	 s 	 	by	half	.
 a 	 side 	 	from	one	-	person	abc	mini	-	 bureau 	 s 	 	in	nairobi	,	new	delhi	and	mumbai	,	there	are	no	network	news	 bureau 	 s 	 	in	all	of	africa	,	india	or	south	america	--	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	home	to	more	than	two	billion	people	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	 cover 	 ing 	 	britney	is	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	lack	of	global	 cover 	 age 	 	is	all	the	more	 disturb 	 ing 	 	when	we	see	where	people	go	for	news	.
local	tv	news	 loom 	 s 	 	large	,	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 dedicate 	 s 	 	12	percent	of	 it 	 s 	 	 cover 	 age 	 	to	 inter 	 national 	 	news	.
and	what	about	the	web	?
the	most	popular	news	 s 	 ites 	 	do	n't	do	much	better	.
last	year	,	pew	and	the	colombia	j	-	school	 analyz 	 ed 	 	the	14,000	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 appear 	 ed 	 	on	google	news	'	front	page	.
and	they	,	in	fact	,	 cover 	 ed 	 	the	same	24	news	 event 	 s 	 	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	a	 stud 	 y 	 	in	 e 	 - 	 content 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	that	much	of	global	news	from	u.s.	news	 creator 	 s 	 	is	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	from	the	ap	wire	 service 	 s 	 	and	reuters	,	and	do	n't	put	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 con 	 text 	 	that	people	can	understand	 the 	 ir 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	it	.
so	,	if	you	put	it	all	together	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	help	explain	why	 to 	 day 	 	's	college	 graduate 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	less	educated	americans	,	know	less	about	the	world	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	did	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	if	you	think	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	you	would	be	wrong	.
in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	americans	who	say	they	 close 	 ly 	 	follow	global	news	most	of	the	time	grew	to	over	50	percent	.
the	real	question	:	is	 th 	 is 	 	 distort 	 ed 	 	 world 	 view 	 	what	we	want	for	americans	in	our	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	world	?
i	know	we	can	do	better	.
and	can	we	afford	not	to	?	thank	you	.
