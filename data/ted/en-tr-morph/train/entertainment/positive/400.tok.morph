my	name	is	ursus	wehrli	,	and	i	would	like	to	talk	to	you	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	about	my	project	,	 tidy 	 ing 	 	up	art	.
first	of	all	--	any	 question 	 s 	 	so	far	?
first	of	all	,	i	have	to	say	i	'm	not	from	around	here	.
i	'm	from	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	cultural	area	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	 notice 	 d 	 	?
i	mean	,	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	tie	,	first	.	and	then	 second 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	a	little	bit	nervous	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	in	a	foreign	language	,	and	i	want	to	 apolog 	 ize 	 	in	advance	,	for	any	 mistak 	 es 	 	i	might	make	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	from	switzerland	,	and	i	just	do	n't	hope	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	swiss	german	i	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	now	here	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	what	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	if	we	swiss	try	to	speak	american	.
but	do	n't	worry	--	i	do	n't	have	trouble	with	english	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	's	not	my	problem	,	it	's	your	language	after	all	.
i	am	fine	.	after	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	here	at	ted	,	i	can	 simpl 	 y 	 	go	back	to	switzerland	,	and	you	have	to	go	on	 talk 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	all	the	time	.
so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	the	 organize 	 rs 	 	to	read	from	my	book	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 tidy 	 ing 	 	up	art	``	and	it	's	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	's	more	or	less	a	picture	book	.
so	the	 read 	 ing 	 	would	be	over	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
but	since	i	'm	here	at	ted	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	hold	my	talk	here	in	a	more	modern	way	,	in	the	spirit	of	ted	here	,	and	i	 manage 	 d 	 	to	do	some	 slide 	 s 	 	here	for	you	.
i	'd	like	to	show	them	around	so	we	can	just	,	you	know	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	for	you	some	 enlarg 	 ed 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	--	even	better	.
so	 tidy 	 ing 	 	up	art	,	i	mean	,	i	have	to	say	,	that	's	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	new	term	.
you	wo	n't	be	familiar	with	it	.
i	mean	,	it	's	a	hobby	of	mine	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 indu 	 lg 	 ing 	 	in	for	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	it	all	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	 th 	 is 	 	picture	of	the	american	artist	,	donald	baechler	i	had	 hang 	 ing 	 	at	home	.	i	had	to	look	at	it	every	day	and	after	a	while	i	just	could	n't	stand	the	mess	 any 	 more 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	was	looking	at	all	day	long	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	kind	of	felt	sorry	for	him	.
and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	me	even	he	felt	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	facing	these	 un 	 organize 	 d 	 	red	 square 	 s 	 	day	after	day	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	him	a	little	support	,	and	 br 	 ought 	 	some	order	 in 	 to 	 	 neat 	 ly 	 	 stack 	 ing 	 	the	 block 	 s 	 	on	top	of	each	other	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.	and	i	think	he	 look 	 s 	 	now	less	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	.
and	it	was	great	.	with	 th 	 is 	 	experience	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	more	 close 	 ly 	 	at	modern	art	.	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	how	,	you	know	,	the	world	of	modern	art	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	topsy	-	turvy	.
and	i	can	show	here	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	simple	one	,	but	it	's	a	good	one	to	start	with	.
it	's	a	picture	by	paul	klee	.
and	we	can	see	here	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	 con 	 fusion 	 	of	color	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.	the	artist	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	seem	to	know	where	to	put	the	different	 color 	 s 	 	.
the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	here	of	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 element 	 s 	 	of	the	picture	--	the	whole	thing	is	 un 	 structure 	 d 	 	.
we	do	n't	know	,	 may 	 be 	 	mr.	klee	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	in	a	 hur 	 ry 	 	,	i	mean	--	--	 may 	 be 	 	he	had	to	catch	a	plane	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
we	can	see	here	he	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	 o 	 range 	 	,	and	then	he	 al 	 ready 	 	ran	out	of	 o 	 range 	 	,	and	here	we	can	see	he	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	a	break	for	a	square	.
and	i	would	like	to	show	you	here	my	 tidi 	 ed 	 	up	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
we	can	see	now	what	was	 bare 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 izable 	 	in	the	original	:	17	red	and	 o 	 range 	 	 square 	 s 	 	are	 juxta 	 posed 	 	with	just	two	green	 square 	 s 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	great	.
so	i	mean	,	that	's	just	 tidy 	 ing 	 	up	for	 beg 	 inner 	 s 	 	.
i	would	like	to	show	you	here	a	picture	which	is	a	bit	more	 advance 	 d 	 	.
what	can	you	say	?	what	a	mess	.
i	mean	,	you	see	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	 scatter 	 ed 	 	 aim 	 lessly 	 	around	the	space	.
if	my	room	back	home	had	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	my	mother	would	have	 ground 	 ed 	 	me	for	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'd	like	to	--	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 introduc 	 e 	 	some	structure	 in 	 to 	 	that	picture	.
and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 tidy 	 ing 	 	up	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	're	right	.	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	clap	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	but	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	in	switzerland	.
we	swiss	are	famous	for	chocolate	and	cheese	.	our	 train 	 s 	 	run	on	time	.
we	are	 on 	 ly 	 	happy	when	 thing 	 s 	 	are	in	order	.
but	to	go	on	,	here	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	to	see	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	by	joan	miro	.
and	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	can	see	the	artist	 ha 	 s 	 	drawn	a	few	lines	and	 shape 	 s 	 	and	 drop 	 ped 	 	them	any	old	way	onto	a	yellow	 back 	 ground 	 	.
and	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	the	sort	of	thing	you	produce	when	you	're	 doodl 	 ing 	 	on	the	phone	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	--	--	you	can	see	now	the	whole	thing	 take 	 s 	 	up	far	less	space	.
it	's	more	 economic 	 al 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	more	efficient	.
with	 th 	 is 	 	method	mr.	miro	could	have	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	canvas	for	 an 	 other 	 	picture	.
but	i	can	see	in	your	 face 	 s 	 	that	you	're	still	a	little	bit	 skeptic 	 al 	 	.
so	that	you	can	just	appreciate	how	serious	i	am	about	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	 br 	 ought 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	 patent 	 s 	 	,	the	 specific 	 ations 	 	for	some	of	these	 work 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	had	my	 work 	 ing 	 	 method 	 s 	 	 patent 	 ed 	 	at	the	eidgenössische	amt	für	geistiges	eigentum	in	bern	,	switzerland	.
i	'll	just	quote	from	the	 specific 	 ation 	 	.
``	laut	den	kunstprüfer	dr.	albrecht	-	-	``	it	's	not	 finish 	 ed 	 	yet	.
``	laut	den	kunstprüfer	dr.	albrecht	götz	von	ohlenhusen	wird	die	verfahrensweise	 recht 	 lich 	 	geschützt	 wel 	 che 	 	die	kunst	 dur 	 ch 	 	 spezifi 	 sch 	 	aufgeräumte	regelmässigkeiten	 de 	 s 	 	 all 	 gemeinen 	 	formenschatzes	 neu 	 e 	 	wirkungen	zu	erzielen	 mög 	 lich 	 	wird	.	``
ja	,	well	i	could	have	 transl 	 ated 	 	that	,	but	you	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 non 	 e 	 	the	 wis 	 er 	 	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	 my 	 self 	 	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	but	it	 sound 	 s 	 	good	 any 	 way 	 	.
i	just	 real 	 ized 	 	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	how	one	 introduc 	 es 	 	new	 idea 	 s 	 	to	people	,	that	's	why	these	 patent 	 s 	 	are	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
i	would	like	to	do	a	short	test	with	you	.
 every 	 one 	 	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 order 	 ly 	 	fashion	here	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	would	like	to	ask	you	all	to	raise	your	right	hand	.	 yea 	 h 	 	.
the	right	hand	is	the	one	we	write	with	,	 a 	 part 	 	from	the	left	-	handers	.
and	now	,	i	'll	count	to	three	.	i	mean	,	it	still	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 order 	 ly 	 	to	me	.
now	,	i	'll	count	to	three	,	and	on	the	count	of	three	i	'd	like	you	all	to	shake	 hand 	 s 	 	with	the	person	 be 	 hind 	 	you	.	ok	?
one	,	two	,	three	.
you	can	see	now	,	that	's	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	even	 behav 	 ing 	 	in	an	 order 	 ly 	 	,	 system 	 atic 	 	way	can	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	lead	to	complete	 cha 	 os 	 	.
so	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	that	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	next	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	by	the	artist	,	niki	de	saint	phalle	.
and	i	mean	,	in	the	original	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 clear 	 	to	see	what	 th 	 is 	 	tangle	of	 color 	 s 	 	and	 shape 	 s 	 	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	depict	.
but	in	the	 tidi 	 ed 	 	up	version	,	it	's	plain	to	see	that	it	's	a	 s 	 un 	 burn 	 t 	 	woman	 play 	 ing 	 	 vol 	 ley 	 ball 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	a	--	 th 	 is 	 	one	here	,	that	's	much	better	.
that	's	a	picture	by	keith	haring	.
i	think	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.
so	,	i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 ha 	 s 	 	not	even	got	a	proper	title	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	untitled	``	and	i	think	that	's	appropriate	.
so	,	in	the	 tidi 	 ed 	 	-	up	version	we	have	a	sort	of	keith	haring	spare	 part 	 s 	 	shop	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	keith	haring	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 statistic 	 ally 	 	.
one	can	see	here	 quit 	 e 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	see	we	have	25	pale	green	 element 	 s 	 	,	of	which	one	is	in	the	form	of	a	circle	.
or	here	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	have	27	pink	 square 	 s 	 	with	 on 	 ly 	 	one	pink	 curv 	 e 	 	.
i	mean	,	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	one	could	extend	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 statistic 	 al 	 	analysis	to	cover	all	mr.	haring	's	 vari 	 ous 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	in	order	to	establish	in	which	period	the	artist	 favor 	 ed 	 	pale	green	 circle 	 s 	 	or	pink	 square 	 s 	 	.
and	the	artist	 him 	 self 	 	could	 al 	 so 	 	benefit	from	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 list 	 ing 	 	procedure	by	using	it	to	estimate	how	 man 	 y 	 	 pot 	 s 	 	of	paint	he	's	 like 	 ly 	 	to	need	in	the	future	.
one	can	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	make	 combination 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	with	the	keith	haring	 circle 	 s 	 	and	kandinsky	's	 dot 	 s 	 	.
you	can	add	them	to	all	the	 square 	 s 	 	of	paul	klee	.
in	the	end	,	one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	list	with	which	one	then	can	arrange	.
then	you	 categor 	 ize 	 	it	,	then	you	file	it	,	put	that	file	in	a	filing	cabinet	,	put	it	in	your	 off 	 ice 	 	and	you	can	make	a	living	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	from	my	own	experience	.	so	i	'm	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	mean	,	here	we	have	some	 artist 	 s 	 	that	are	a	bit	more	 structure 	 d 	 	.	it	's	not	too	bad	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ja 	 s 	 per 	 	johns	.	we	can	see	here	he	was	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	with	his	 rul 	 er 	 	.
but	i	think	it	could	still	benefit	from	more	discipline	.
and	i	think	the	whole	thing	 add 	 s 	 	up	much	better	if	you	do	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	here	,	that	's	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	.
 tidy 	 ing 	 	up	rene	magritte	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.
you	know	,	there	is	a	--	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	what	inspired	me	to	embark	on	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	a	time	when	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	often	 stay 	 ing 	 	in	 hotel 	 s 	 	.
so	once	i	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	stay	in	a	ritzy	,	five	-	star	hotel	.
and	you	know	,	there	you	had	 th 	 is 	 	little	sign	--	i	put	 th 	 is 	 	little	sign	 out 	 side 	 	the	door	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	that	read	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	tidy	room	.	``	i	do	n't	know	if	you	have	them	over	here	.
so	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	my	room	there	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 tidi 	 ed 	 	once	 dai 	 ly 	 	,	but	three	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.
so	after	a	while	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	have	a	little	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	before	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	room	each	day	i	'd	scatter	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	around	the	space	.
like	 book 	 s 	 	,	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	 tooth 	 brush 	 	,	etc	.	and	it	was	great	.
by	the	time	i	 return 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 neat 	 ly 	 	 return 	 ed 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	place	.
but	then	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	hang	the	same	little	sign	onto	that	picture	by	vincent	van	gogh	.
and	you	have	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	room	had	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 tidi 	 ed 	 	up	since	1888	.
and	when	i	 return 	 ed 	 	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	is	now	possible	to	do	some	 vacuum 	 ing 	 	.
ok	,	i	mean	,	i	can	see	there	are	 al 	 ways 	 	people	that	like	 react 	 ing 	 	that	one	or	 an 	 other 	 	picture	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	 tidi 	 ed 	 	up	.	so	we	can	make	a	short	test	with	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	by	rene	magritte	,	and	i	'd	like	you	all	to	 in 	 ward 	 ly 	 	--	like	in	your	head	,	that	is	--	to	tidy	that	up	.	so	it	's	possible	that	some	of	you	would	make	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	?	i	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	prefer	to	do	it	more	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
some	people	would	make	apple	pie	out	of	it	.
but	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	to	see	that	the	whole	work	was	more	of	a	 hand 	 i 	 craft 	 	endeavor	that	 involve 	 d 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	time	-	 consum 	 ing 	 	job	of	cutting	out	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 element 	 s 	 	and	 stick 	 ing 	 	them	back	in	new	 arrange 	 ments 	 	.
and	it	's	not	 d 	 one 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	imagine	,	with	the	computer	,	 other 	 wise 	 	it	would	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	now	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	tidy	up	 picture 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tidy	up	for	a	long	time	.
here	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	take	jackson	pollock	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
it	's	--	oh	,	no	,	it	's	--	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	one	.
but	after	a	while	,	i	just	 decide 	 d 	 	here	to	go	all	the	way	and	put	the	paint	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 can 	 s 	 	.
or	you	could	go	 in 	 to 	 	three	-	dimensional	art	.
here	we	have	the	fur	cup	by	meret	oppenheim	.
here	i	just	 br 	 ought 	 	it	back	to	 it 	 s 	 	original	state	.
but	 yea 	 h 	 	,	and	it	's	great	,	you	can	even	go	,	you	know	--	or	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 point 	 ill 	 ist 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	 in 	 to 	 	art	.
the	 point 	 ill 	 ist 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	is	that	kind	of	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	where	 every 	 thing 	 	is	broken	down	 in 	 to 	 	 dot 	 s 	 	and	 pixel 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	--	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	is	ideal	for	 tidy 	 ing 	 	up	.
so	i	once	 appli 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	the	work	of	the	inventor	of	that	method	,	georges	seurat	,	and	i	 collect 	 ed 	 	together	all	his	 dot 	 s 	 	.
and	now	they	're	all	in	here	.
you	can	count	them	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	if	you	like	.
you	see	,	that	's	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	about	the	tidy	up	art	idea	:	it	's	new	.	so	there	is	no	 exist 	 ing 	 	tradition	in	it	.
there	is	no	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	,	i	mean	,	not	yet	,	 any 	 way 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	's	``	the	future	we	will	create	.	``
but	to	round	 thing 	 s 	 	up	i	would	like	to	show	you	just	one	more	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	village	square	by	pieter	bruegel	.
that	's	how	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	when	you	 s 	 end 	 	 every 	 one 	 	home	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	where	old	bruegel	's	people	went	?
of	course	,	they	're	not	gone	.	they	're	all	here	.
i	just	 pil 	 ed 	 	them	up	.
so	i	'm	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	'm	kind	of	 finish 	 ed 	 	at	that	moment	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	want	to	see	more	,	i	've	got	my	book	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	in	the	 book 	 shop 	 	.
and	i	'm	happy	to	sign	it	for	you	with	any	name	of	any	artist	.
but	before	 leav 	 ing 	 	i	would	like	to	show	you	,	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	right	now	on	 an 	 other 	 	--	in	a	related	field	with	my	 tidy 	 ing 	 	up	art	method	.	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	in	a	related	field	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	some	order	 in 	 to 	 	some	 flag 	 s 	 	.
here	--	that	's	just	my	new	proposal	here	for	the	 un 	 ion 	 	jack	.
and	then	 may 	 be 	 	before	i	 leav 	 e 	 	you	...
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	think	,	after	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	that	i	have	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	was	a	hard	one	.	i	could	n't	find	a	way	to	tidy	that	up	 proper 	 ly 	 	,	so	i	just	 decide 	 d 	 	to	make	it	a	little	bit	more	 simpl 	 er 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
