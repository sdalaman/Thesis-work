i	'd	like	to	dedicate	 th 	 is 	 	one	to	all	the	women	in	south	africa	--	 t 	 hose 	 	women	who	 re 	 fused 	 	to	 dwindl 	 e 	 	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	apartheid	.
and	,	of	course	,	i	'm	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ating 	 	it	 al 	 so 	 	to	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	whom	i	think	 re 	 ally 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 import 	 ant 	 	 role 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	me	when	i	was	an	activist	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 harass 	 ed 	 	by	the	police	.
you	will	recall	that	in	1976	,	june	16	,	the	 student 	 s 	 	of	south	africa	 boycott 	 ed 	 	the	language	of	afrikaans	 a 	 s 	 	the	medium	of	the	 oppress 	 or 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	sort	of	like	 re 	 ally 	 	told	that	they	must	do	 every 	 thing 	 	in	afrikaans	--	biology	,	 mathematic 	 s 	 	--	and	what	about	our	 language 	 s 	 	?
and	the	 student 	 s 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	speak	to	the	government	,	and	police	 answer 	 ed 	 	with	 bullet 	 s 	 	.
so	every	year	,	june	16	,	we	will	 commemo 	 rate 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 comrade 	 s 	 	or	 student 	 s 	 	who	 di 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	young	then	.	i	think	i	was	11	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	when	my	 politic 	 al 	 	education	 start 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	 join 	 ed 	 	,	 lat 	 er 	 	on	,	the	youth	 organ 	 ization 	 	under	the	african	national	congress	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	 organ 	 izing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	 what 	 ever 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 commemo 	 ration 	 	,	the	police	will	round	us	up	 a 	 s 	 	they	call	us	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	i	used	to	run	away	from	home	,	when	i	know	that	 may 	 be 	 	the	police	might	be	coming	around	the	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	or	10th	of	june	or	so	.
and	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	one	time	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	look	,	you	're	not	going	to	run	away	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	your	place	,	you	stay	here	.	``
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	police	came	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	'll	just	arrest	us	and	put	us	in	jail	and	 re 	 lease 	 	us	 when 	 ever 	 	they	feel	like	,	after	the	20th	or	so	.
so	it	was	on	the	10th	of	june	,	and	they	came	,	and	they	 surround 	 ed 	 	the	house	,	and	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	off	all	the	 light 	 s 	 	in	the	house	,	and	 open 	 ed 	 	the	kitchen	door	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	to	them	,	``	vusi	's	here	,	and	you	're	not	going	to	take	him	 to 	 night 	 	.
i	'm	 tire 	 d 	 	of	you	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	come	here	,	 harass 	 ing 	 	us	,	while	your	children	are	 sleep 	 ing 	 	 peace 	 fully 	 	in	your	 home 	 s 	 	.
he	is	here	,	and	you	're	not	going	to	take	him	.
i	've	got	a	bowl	full	of	 boil 	 ing 	 	water	--	the	first	one	who	 come 	 s 	 	in	here	,	 get 	 s 	 	it	.	``
and	they	left	.
