i	have	a	tough	job	to	do	.
you	know	,	when	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	profile	of	the	audience	here	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 con 	 not 	 ations 	 	and	design	,	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	 form 	 s 	 	,	and	with	so	much	and	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 collabor 	 ative 	 	and	 network 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	,	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	you	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	an	argument	for	 prim 	 ary 	 	education	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 con 	 text 	 	.
in	order	to	do	that	in	20	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	have	to	 br 	 ing 	 	out	four	 idea 	 s 	 	--	it	's	like	four	 piece 	 s 	 	of	a	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
and	if	i	succeed	in	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	would	go	back	with	the	thought	that	you	could	build	on	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	help	me	do	my	work	.
the	first	piece	of	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	is	 remote 	 ness 	 	and	the	quality	of	education	.
now	,	by	 remote 	 ness 	 	,	i	mean	two	or	three	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	 remote 	 ness 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	normal	sense	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	further	and	further	away	from	an	urban	center	,	you	get	to	 remote 	 r 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	education	?
the	second	,	or	a	different	kind	of	 remote 	 ness 	 	is	that	 with 	 in 	 	the	large	 metro 	 politan 	 	 area 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	,	you	have	 pocket 	 s 	 	,	like	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	,	or	 shanty 	 town 	 s 	 	,	or	 poor 	 er 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 social 	 ly 	 	and	 economic 	 ally 	 	remote	from	the	rest	of	the	city	,	so	it	's	us	and	them	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	education	in	that	 con 	 text 	 	?
so	keep	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	 remote 	 ness 	 	.
we	made	a	guess	.	the	guess	was	that	 school 	 s 	 	in	remote	 area 	 s 	 	do	not	have	good	 en 	 ough 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
if	they	do	have	,	they	can	not	retain	 t 	 hose 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
they	do	not	have	good	 en 	 ough 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
and	if	they	had	some	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	they	have	 difficult 	 y 	 	 maintain 	 ing 	 	it	.
but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	check	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	.	so	what	i	did	last	year	was	we	 hire 	 d 	 	a	car	,	 look 	 ed 	 	up	on	google	,	found	a	route	 in 	 to 	 	 north 	 ern 	 	india	from	new	delhi	which	,	you	know	,	which	did	not	cross	any	big	cities	or	any	big	 metro 	 politan 	 	 center 	 s 	 	.	drove	out	about	300	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	and	 where 	 ver 	 	we	found	a	school	,	 administer 	 ed 	 	a	set	of	standard	 test 	 s 	 	,	and	then	took	 t 	 hose 	 	test	 result 	 s 	 	and	 plot 	 ted 	 	them	on	a	graph	.
the	graph	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	need	to	consider	it	 care 	 fully 	 	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 s 	 ample 	 	;	you	should	not	 general 	 ize 	 	from	it	.
but	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	obvious	,	 quit 	 e 	 	clear	,	that	for	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	route	that	i	had	taken	,	the	 remote 	 r 	 	the	school	was	,	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 result 	 s 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	.
that	 seem 	 ed 	 	a	little	 damn 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	correlate	it	with	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	or	with	the	 avail 	 ability 	 	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
to	my	surprise	,	it	did	not	correlate	.
it	did	not	correlate	with	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
it	did	not	correlate	with	the	quality	of	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
it	did	not	correlate	with	the	poverty	 level 	 s 	 	.	it	did	not	correlate	.
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	when	i	 administer 	 ed 	 	a	 question 	 naire 	 	to	each	of	these	 school 	 s 	 	,	with	one	single	question	for	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	--	which	was	,	``	would	you	like	to	move	to	an	urban	,	 metro 	 politan 	 	area	?	``	--	69	percent	of	them	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	from	that	,	they	say	 y 	 es 	 	just	a	little	bit	out	of	delhi	,	and	they	say	no	when	you	hit	the	rich	 suburb 	 s 	 	of	delhi	--	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 relat 	 ively 	 	better	off	 area 	 s 	 	--	and	then	from	200	 kilometer 	 s 	 	out	of	delhi	,	the	answer	is	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	 y 	 es 	 	.
i	would	imagine	that	a	teacher	who	 come 	 s 	 	or	 walk 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	class	every	day	 think 	 ing 	 	that	,	i	wish	i	was	in	some	other	school	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	deep	impact	on	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 look 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	teacher	 motiv 	 ation 	 	and	teacher	 migr 	 ation 	 	was	a	 power 	 fully 	 	 correlate 	 d 	 	thing	with	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 prim 	 ary 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	the	children	have	 en 	 ough 	 	to	eat	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	they	are	 pack 	 ed 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 class 	 rooms 	 	and	that	sort	of	thing	.	it	 appear 	 s 	 	that	way	.
when	you	take	education	and	technology	,	then	i	find	in	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	that	,	you	know	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	,	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	--	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	all	that	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 pilot 	 ed 	 	first	in	the	best	 school 	 s 	 	,	the	best	urban	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	me	,	 bias 	 es 	 	the	result	.
the	 liter 	 ature 	 	--	one	part	of	it	,	the	scientific	 liter 	 ature 	 	--	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	 blame 	 s 	 	et	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	over	-	hyped	and	under	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	.
the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	say	,	well	,	it	's	fine	,	but	it	's	too	expensive	for	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 pilot 	 ed 	 	in	a	school	where	the	 student 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	,	let	's	say	,	80	percent	of	 what 	 ever 	 	they	could	do	.
you	put	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	super	-	duper	technology	,	and	now	they	get	83	percent	.
so	the	principal	 look 	 s 	 	at	it	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	3	percent	for	300,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	?	forget	it	.
if	you	took	the	same	technology	and	 pilot 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	remote	 school 	 s 	 	,	where	the	score	was	30	percent	,	and	,	let	's	say	,	took	that	up	to	40	percent	--	that	will	be	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	thing	.
so	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	change	that	et	,	 education 	 al 	 	technology	,	would	make	,	would	be	far	 great 	 er 	 	at	the	bottom	of	the	pyramid	than	at	the	top	,	but	we	seem	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	it	the	other	way	about	.
so	i	came	to	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	et	should	reach	the	 under 	 privilege 	 d 	 	first	,	not	the	other	way	about	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	came	the	question	of	,	how	do	you	tackle	teacher	 per 	 ception 	 	?
 when 	 ever 	 	you	go	to	a	teacher	and	show	them	some	technology	,	the	teacher	's	first	 re 	 action 	 	is	,	you	can	not	replace	a	teacher	with	a	machine	--	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	why	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	,	but	,	even	for	a	moment	,	if	you	did	 assum 	 e 	 	that	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	--	i	have	a	 quota 	 tion 	 	from	 s 	 ir 	 	arthur	c.	clarke	,	the	science	fiction	writer	whom	i	met	in	colombo	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 complete 	 ly 	 	 solve 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	a	teacher	than	can	be	 replace 	 d 	 	by	a	machine	,	should	be	.
so	,	you	know	,	it	 put 	 s 	 	the	teacher	 in 	 to 	 	a	tough	bind	,	you	have	to	think	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	so	i	'm	 pro 	 posing 	 	that	an	 alter 	 native 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	education	,	 what 	 ever 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	you	want	,	is	 requir 	 ed 	 	where	 school 	 s 	 	do	n't	exist	,	where	 school 	 s 	 	are	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	,	where	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	not	 avail 	 able 	 	or	where	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	,	for	 what 	 ever 	 	reason	.
if	you	happen	to	live	in	a	part	of	the	world	where	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 appli 	 es 	 	,	then	you	do	n't	need	an	 alter 	 native 	 	education	.
so	far	i	have	n't	come	 a 	 cross 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	an	area	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	one	case	.	i	wo	n't	name	the	area	,	but	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	world	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	do	n't	have	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	perfect	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	perfect	 school 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 s 	 uch 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	but	--	 any 	 way 	 	,	i	'd	never	heard	that	 any 	 where 	 	else	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	children	and	self	-	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	and	a	set	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	which	sort	of	led	to	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	what	might	an	 alter 	 native 	 	education	be	like	.
they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	the	hole	-	in	-	the	-	wall	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	rush	through	 th 	 is 	 	.	they	're	a	set	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
the	first	one	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	new	delhi	in	1999	.
and	what	we	did	over	there	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	simple	.
i	had	an	 off 	 ice 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	which	 border 	 ed 	 	a	 s 	 lum 	 	,	an	urban	 s 	 lum 	 	,	so	there	was	a	 divid 	 ing 	 	wall	between	our	 off 	 ice 	 	and	the	urban	 s 	 lum 	 	.
they	cut	a	hole	 in 	 side 	 	that	wall	--	which	is	how	it	 ha 	 s 	 	got	the	name	hole	-	in	-	the	-	wall	--	and	put	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	pc	 in 	 to 	 	that	hole	,	sort	of	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	wall	so	that	 it 	 s 	 	monitor	was	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	at	the	other	end	,	a	 touch 	 pad 	 	 similar 	 ly 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	wall	,	put	it	on	high	-	speed	 inter 	 net 	 	,	put	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 explore 	 r 	 	there	,	put	it	on	altavista.com	--	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	--	and	just	left	it	there	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	saw	.
so	that	was	my	 off 	 ice 	 	in	iit	.	here	's	the	hole	-	in	-	the	-	wall	.
about	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	found	 th 	 is 	 	kid	.
to	the	right	is	 th 	 is 	 	eight	-	year	-	old	child	who	--	and	to	his	left	is	a	six	-	year	-	old	girl	,	who	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	tall	.
and	what	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	was	,	he	was	 teach 	 ing 	 	her	to	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	.
so	it	sort	of	raised	more	 question 	 s 	 	than	it	 answer 	 ed 	 	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	real	?	 do 	 es 	 	the	language	matter	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	know	english	?
will	the	computer	last	,	or	will	they	break	it	and	steal	it	--	and	did	 any 	 one 	 	teach	them	?
the	last	question	is	what	 every 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	but	you	know	,	i	mean	,	they	must	have	 poke 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	head	over	the	wall	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	people	in	your	 off 	 ice 	 	,	can	you	show	me	how	to	do	it	,	and	then	 some 	 body 	 	taught	him	.
so	i	took	the	experiment	out	of	delhi	and	 repeat 	 ed 	 	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	time	in	a	city	 call 	 ed 	 	shivpuri	in	the	center	of	india	,	where	i	was	 assur 	 ed 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	had	ever	taught	 any 	 body 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
so	it	was	a	warm	day	,	and	the	hole	in	the	wall	was	on	that	 decr 	 epit 	 	old	building	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	kid	who	came	there	;	he	 lat 	 er 	 	on	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	13	-	year	-	old	school	 drop 	 out 	 	.
he	came	there	and	he	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 fiddl 	 e 	 	around	with	the	 touch 	 pad 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	he	 notice 	 d 	 	that	when	he	 move 	 s 	 	his	finger	on	the	 touch 	 pad 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 move 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	--	and	 lat 	 er 	 	on	he	told	me	,	``	i	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	where	you	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.	``
so	he	 figur 	 ed 	 	that	out	.	it	took	him	over	two	 minute 	 s 	 	to	figure	out	that	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
and	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	he	made	an	 accident 	 al 	 	click	by	hitting	the	 touch 	 pad 	 	--	you	'll	see	him	do	that	.
he	did	that	,	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 explore 	 r 	 	 change 	 d 	 	page	.
eight	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	he	 look 	 ed 	 	from	his	hand	to	the	screen	,	and	he	was	 brow 	 s 	 ing 	 	:	he	was	going	back	and	forth	.
when	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	he	 start 	 ed 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	all	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	children	,	like	,	children	would	come	and	see	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	over	here	.
and	by	the	 even 	 ing 	 	of	that	day	,	70	children	 we 	 re 	 	all	 brow 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
so	eight	 minute 	 s 	 	and	an	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	computer	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	all	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	there	.
so	we	thought	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	:	that	children	in	 group 	 s 	 	can	self	-	instruct	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	use	a	computer	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.	but	under	what	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	?
at	 th 	 is 	 	time	there	was	a	--	the	main	question	was	about	english	.
people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	ought	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	in	indian	 language 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	have	what	,	 s 	 hall 	 	i	 transl 	 ate 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 in 	 to 	 	some	indian	language	?	that	's	not	possible	.
so	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	the	other	way	about	.
but	let	's	see	,	how	do	the	children	tackle	the	english	language	?
i	took	the	experiment	out	to	 north 	 eastern 	 	india	,	to	a	village	 call 	 ed 	 	madantusi	,	where	,	for	some	reason	,	there	was	no	english	teacher	,	so	the	children	had	not	 learn 	 ed 	 	english	at	all	.
and	i	built	a	similar	hole	-	in	-	the	-	wall	.
one	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	 village 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	the	urban	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	:	there	 we 	 re 	 	more	 girl 	 s 	 	than	 boy 	 s 	 	who	came	to	the	kiosk	.
in	the	urban	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	,	the	 girl 	 s 	 	tend	to	stay	away	.
i	left	the	computer	there	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	cds	--	i	did	n't	have	any	 inter 	 net 	 	--	and	came	back	three	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	when	i	came	back	there	,	i	found	these	two	 kid 	 s 	 	,	eight	-	and	12	-	year	-	olds	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	a	game	on	the	computer	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	they	saw	me	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	need	a	 fast 	 er 	 	processor	and	a	better	mouse	.	``
i	was	real	 surprise 	 d 	 	.
you	know	,	how	on	earth	did	they	know	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	we	've	 pick 	 ed 	 	it	up	from	the	cds	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	how	did	you	understand	what	's	going	on	over	there	?	``
so	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	've	left	 th 	 is 	 	machine	which	 talk 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	english	,	so	we	had	to	learn	english	.	``
so	then	i	 measur 	 ed 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	using	200	english	 word 	 s 	 	with	each	other	--	 mis 	 pronounce 	 d 	 	,	but	correct	 us 	 age 	 	--	 word 	 s 	 	like	exit	,	stop	,	find	,	 s 	 ave 	 	,	that	kind	of	thing	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	do	with	the	computer	but	in	 the 	 ir 	 	day	-	to	-	day	 conversation 	 s 	 	.
so	,	madantusi	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	show	that	language	is	not	a	 bar 	 rier 	 	;	in	fact	they	may	be	able	to	teach	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	language	if	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	got	some	 fund 	 ing 	 	to	try	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	out	to	see	if	these	 result 	 s 	 	are	 replica 	 ble 	 	,	if	they	happen	 every 	 where 	 	else	.
india	is	a	good	place	to	do	 s 	 uch 	 	an	experiment	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	all	the	ethnic	 divers 	 ities 	 	,	all	the	--	you	know	,	the	genetic	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	all	the	racial	 divers 	 ities 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	all	the	socio	-	economic	 divers 	 ities 	 	.
so	,	i	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	to	cover	a	cross	section	that	would	cover	 practical 	 ly 	 	the	whole	world	.
so	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	for	 al 	 most 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	 re 	 ally 	 	took	us	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	length	and	 bread 	 th 	 	of	india	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	himalayas	.	up	in	the	north	,	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	had	to	check	or	invent	an	 engineer 	 ing 	 	design	which	would	 surviv 	 e 	 	 out 	 door 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	using	regular	,	normal	pcs	,	so	i	 need 	 ed 	 	different	 climate 	 s 	 	,	for	which	india	is	 al 	 so 	 	great	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hot	,	and	so	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	desert	to	the	west	.	near	the	pakistan	border	.
and	you	see	here	a	little	clip	of	--	one	of	these	 village 	 s 	 	--	the	first	thing	that	these	children	did	was	to	find	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	to	teach	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	english	 alpha 	 bet 	 	.
then	to	central	india	--	 ver 	 y 	 	warm	,	moist	,	 fish 	 ing 	 	 village 	 s 	 	,	where	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	killer	of	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
so	we	had	to	solve	all	the	 problem 	 s 	 	we	had	 with 	 out 	 	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	and	with	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	power	,	so	most	of	the	 solution 	 s 	 	that	came	out	used	little	 blast 	 s 	 	of	air	put	at	the	right	 place 	 s 	 	to	keep	the	 machine 	 s 	 	running	.
i	want	to	just	cut	 th 	 is 	 	short	.	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	sequence	is	 al 	 so 	 	nice	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	small	child	,	a	six	-	year	-	old	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	his	 el 	 d 	 est 	 	sister	what	to	do	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	often	with	these	 computer 	 s 	 	,	that	the	 young 	 er 	 	children	are	found	 teach 	 ing 	 	the	 old 	 er 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
what	did	we	find	?	we	found	that	six	-	to	13	-	year	-	olds	can	self	-	instruct	in	a	 connect 	 ed 	 	environment	,	 ir 	 respect 	 ive 	 	of	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	could	measure	.
so	if	they	have	access	to	the	computer	,	they	will	teach	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
i	could	n't	find	a	single	correlation	with	 any 	 thing 	 	,	but	it	had	to	be	in	 group 	 s 	 	.
and	that	may	be	of	great	,	you	know	,	interest	to	 th 	 is 	 	group	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	you	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 group 	 s 	 	.
so	here	was	the	power	of	what	a	group	of	children	can	do	,	if	you	lift	the	adult	intervention	.
just	a	quick	idea	of	the	 measure 	 ments 	 	.
we	took	standard	 statistic 	 al 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	,	so	i	'm	going	to	not	talk	about	that	.
but	we	got	a	clean	 learn 	 ing 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	what	you	would	get	in	a	school	.
i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	it	at	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	i	mean	,	it	sort	of	 say 	 s 	 	it	all	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	?
what	could	they	learn	to	do	?
 bas 	 ic 	 	 window 	 s 	 	 function 	 s 	 	,	 brow 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	 chat 	 ting 	 	and	email	,	 game 	 s 	 	and	 education 	 al 	 	material	,	music	 download 	 s 	 	,	 play 	 ing 	 	video	.
in	short	,	what	all	of	us	do	.
and	over	300	children	will	 be 	 come 	 	computer	 liter 	 ate 	 	and	be	able	to	do	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	in	six	 month 	 s 	 	with	one	computer	.
so	,	how	do	they	do	that	?
if	you	 calcul 	 ated 	 	the	actual	time	of	access	,	it	would	work	out	to	 minute 	 s 	 	per	day	,	so	that	's	not	how	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
what	you	have	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	there	is	one	child	 oper 	 ating 	 	the	computer	.
and	 surround 	 ing 	 	him	are	 usual 	 ly 	 	three	other	children	,	who	are	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	him	on	what	they	should	do	.
if	you	test	them	,	all	four	will	get	the	same	 score 	 s 	 	in	 what 	 ever 	 	you	ask	them	.
around	these	four	are	 usual 	 ly 	 	a	group	of	about	16	children	,	who	are	 al 	 so 	 	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	 wrong 	 ly 	 	,	about	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	going	on	on	the	computer	.
and	all	of	them	 al 	 so 	 	will	clear	a	test	 give 	 n 	 	on	that	subject	.
so	they	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	by	 watch 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	learn	by	 do 	 ing 	 	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	counter	-	intuitive	to	adult	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	but	remember	,	eight	-	year	-	olds	live	in	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	where	most	of	the	time	they	are	told	,	do	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	,	do	n't	touch	the	 whisk 	 ey 	 	bottle	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	the	eight	-	year	-	old	do	?
he	 observ 	 es 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	how	a	 whisk 	 ey 	 	bottle	should	be	 touch 	 ed 	 	.
and	if	you	tested	him	,	he	would	answer	every	question	 correct 	 ly 	 	on	that	 top 	 ic 	 	.
so	,	they	seem	to	be	able	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	what	was	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	over	the	six	 year 	 s 	 	of	work	?
it	was	that	 prim 	 ary 	 	education	can	happen	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	,	or	 part 	 s 	 	of	it	can	happen	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	to	be	 impose 	 d 	 	from	the	top	 down 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
it	could	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	be	a	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	system	,	so	that	was	the	second	bit	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	you	,	that	children	can	self	-	organize	and	attain	an	 education 	 al 	 	 object 	 ive 	 	.
the	third	piece	was	on	 value 	 s 	 	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	to	put	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	i	 conduct 	 ed 	 	a	test	over	500	children	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	all	over	india	,	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	--	i	 g 	 ave 	 	them	about	68	different	 value 	 s 	 	-	oriented	 question 	 s 	 	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	 the 	 ir 	 	 opinion 	 s 	 	.
we	got	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 opinion 	 s 	 	.	 y 	 es 	 	,	no	or	i	do	n't	know	.
i	 simpl 	 y 	 	took	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	where	i	got	50	percent	 y 	 es 	 es 	 	and	50	percent	 no 	 es 	 	--	so	i	was	able	to	get	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	16	 s 	 uch 	 	 state 	 ments 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	 area 	 s 	 	where	the	children	 we 	 re 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	half	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	and	half	 s 	 aid 	 	no	.
a	typical	 ex 	 ample 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	,	``	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	tell	lies	.	``
they	do	n't	have	a	way	to	determine	which	way	to	answer	 th 	 is 	 	question	;	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	do	.
so	i	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	third	question	.
can	technology	alter	the	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	of	 value 	 s 	 	?
 final 	 ly 	 	,	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	about	which	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	wo	n't	say	too	much	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	all	about	it	.
natural	 system 	 s 	 	are	all	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	:	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 organism 	 s 	 	,	 socie 	 ties 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	debate	about	an	intelligent	 design 	 er 	 	.
but	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	time	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	science	 go 	 es 	 	,	it	's	self	-	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
but	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	are	traffic	 jam 	 s 	 	,	stock	market	,	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	disaster	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	,	 terror 	 ism 	 	and	insurgency	.
and	you	know	about	the	 inter 	 net 	 	-	based	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	here	are	my	four	 sentence 	 s 	 	then	.
 remote 	 ness 	 	 affect 	 s 	 	the	quality	of	education	.
 education 	 al 	 	technology	should	be	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	remote	 area 	 s 	 	first	,	and	other	 area 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
 value 	 s 	 	are	 acquir 	 ed 	 	;	 doctri 	 ne 	 	and	dogma	are	 impose 	 d 	 	--	the	two	 oppos 	 ing 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	.
and	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	most	 like 	 ly 	 	a	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	system	.
if	you	put	all	the	four	together	,	then	it	 give 	 s 	 	--	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	me	--	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	goal	,	a	vision	,	for	 education 	 al 	 	technology	.
an	 education 	 al 	 	technology	and	 ped 	 ago 	 gy 	 	that	is	digital	,	 autom 	 atic 	 	,	fault	-	 toler 	 ant 	 	,	 minimal 	 ly 	 	invasive	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	and	self	-	 organize 	 d 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 education 	 ists 	 	,	we	have	never	 ask 	 ed 	 	for	technology	;	we	keep	 borrow 	 ing 	 	it	.
powerpoint	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	great	 education 	 al 	 	technology	,	but	it	was	not	 me 	 ant 	 	for	education	,	it	was	 me 	 ant 	 	for	making	 board 	 room 	 	 present 	 ations 	 	.
we	 borrow 	 ed 	 	it	.	video	 confer 	 encing 	 	.	the	personal	computer	 it 	 self 	 	.
i	think	it	's	time	that	the	 education 	 ists 	 	made	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 spec 	 s 	 	,	and	i	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	set	of	 spec 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	brief	look	at	that	.
and	 s 	 uch 	 	a	set	of	 spec 	 s 	 	should	produce	the	technology	to	address	 remote 	 ness 	 	,	 value 	 s 	 	and	violence	.
so	i	thought	i	'd	give	it	a	name	--	why	do	n't	we	call	it	``	 out 	 doctri 	 nation 	 	.	``
and	could	 th 	 is 	 	be	a	goal	for	 education 	 al 	 	technology	in	the	future	?
so	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	thought	with	you	.
thank	you	.
