good	 morn 	 ing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	talk	about	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	first	thing	is	water	.
now	i	see	you	've	all	 be 	 en 	 	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	water	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 provide 	 d 	 	for	you	here	at	the	 con 	 ference 	 	,	over	the	past	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	'll	feel	that	it	's	from	a	safe	source	.
but	what	if	it	was	n't	?
what	if	it	was	from	a	source	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
then	 statistic 	 s 	 	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	say	that	half	of	you	would	now	be	 suffer 	 ing 	 	with	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	lot	in	the	past	about	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 pro 	 vision 	 	of	safe	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	for	all	.
but	they	just	do	n't	seem	to	get	through	.
and	i	think	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	out	why	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	,	using	current	 think 	 ing 	 	,	the	scale	of	the	problem	just	 seem 	 s 	 	too	huge	to	 contempl 	 ate 	 	solving	.
so	we	just	 s 	 witch 	 	off	:	us	,	 government 	 s 	 	and	aid	 age 	 ncies 	 	.
well	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	show	you	that	through	 think 	 ing 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	the	problem	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	.
by	the	way	,	since	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	13,000	people	around	the	world	are	 suffer 	 ing 	 	now	with	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.
and	four	children	have	just	 di 	 ed 	 	.
i	 invent 	 ed 	 	 life 	 saver 	 	bottle	 be 	 cause 	 	i	got	 ang 	 ry 	 	.
i	,	like	most	of	you	,	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	down	,	the	day	after	christmas	in	2004	,	when	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	news	of	the	asian	tsunami	 a 	 s 	 	it	 roll 	 ed 	 	in	,	 play 	 ing 	 	out	on	tv	.
the	 day 	 s 	 	and	 week 	 s 	 	that	 follow 	 ed 	 	,	people	 flee 	 ing 	 	to	the	 hill 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 force 	 d 	 	to	drink	 contami 	 nated 	 	water	or	face	death	.
that	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	me	.
then	,	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	hurricane	katrina	 s 	 lam 	 med 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	side	of	america	.
``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	``	i	thought	,	``	here	's	a	first	world	country	,	let	's	see	what	they	can	do	.	``
day	one	:	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
day	two	:	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
do	you	know	it	took	five	 day 	 s 	 	to	get	water	to	the	superdome	?
people	 we 	 re 	 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	each	other	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	for	tv	 set 	 s 	 	and	water	.
that	's	when	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	had	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
now	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	my	 gar 	 age 	 	,	over	the	next	 week 	 s 	 	and	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	in	my	kitchen	--	much	to	the	 dis 	 may 	 	of	my	wife	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	after	a	few	 fail 	 ed 	 	 prototype 	 s 	 	,	i	 final 	 ly 	 	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	 life 	 saver 	 	bottle	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	for	the	science	bit	.
before	 life 	 saver 	 	,	the	best	hand	 filter 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 filter 	 ing 	 	down	to	about	200	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	.
the	 small 	 est 	 	bacteria	is	about	200	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	.
so	a	200	-	 nano 	 meter 	 	bacteria	is	going	to	get	through	a	200	-	 nano 	 meter 	 	hole	.
the	 small 	 est 	 	virus	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	about	25	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	going	to	get	through	 t 	 hose 	 	200	 nano 	 meter 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	.
 life 	 saver 	 	 pore 	 s 	 	are	15	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	.
so	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	through	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	give	you	a	bit	of	a	 demonst 	 ration 	 	.
would	you	like	to	see	that	?
i	 s 	 pent 	 	all	the	time	setting	 th 	 is 	 	up	,	so	i	guess	i	should	.
we	're	in	the	fine	city	of	oxford	.
so	--	 some 	 one 	 	's	 d 	 one 	 	that	up	.
fine	city	of	oxford	,	so	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	i	've	gone	and	got	some	water	from	the	river	cherwell	,	and	the	river	thames	,	that	flow	through	here	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	water	.
but	i	got	to	 think 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	middle	of	a	flood	zone	in	bangladesh	,	the	water	would	n't	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	i	've	gone	and	got	some	stuff	to	add	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	my	pond	.
have	a	smell	of	that	,	 mis 	 ter 	 	 camera 	 man 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	right	.
we	're	just	going	to	pour	that	in	there	.
audience	:	ugh	!
michael	pritchard	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	we	've	got	some	 run 	 off 	 	from	a	 sew 	 age 	 	plant	farm	.
so	i	'm	just	going	to	put	that	in	there	.
put	that	in	there	.	there	we	go	.
and	some	other	bits	and	 piece 	 s 	 	,	chuck	that	in	there	.
and	i	've	got	a	gift	here	from	a	friend	of	mine	's	 rabbi 	 t 	 	.
so	we	're	just	going	to	put	that	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	now	.
the	 life 	 saver 	 	bottle	 work 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	.
you	just	scoop	the	water	up	.
 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	use	a	jug	just	to	show	you	all	.	let	's	get	a	bit	of	that	poo	in	there	.
that	's	not	 dirt 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.	let	's	just	stir	that	up	a	little	bit	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	i	'm	going	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 filth 	 y 	 	water	,	and	put	it	in	here	.	do	you	want	a	drink	yet	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	there	we	go	.
replace	the	top	.
give	it	a	few	 pump 	 s 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
that	's	all	that	's	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	i	pop	the	 tea 	 t 	 	,	 steril 	 e 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	is	going	to	come	out	.
i	've	got	to	be	quick	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	ready	?
there	we	go	.	mind	the	 electric 	 s 	 	.
that	is	safe	,	 steril 	 e 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
 cheer 	 s 	 	.
there	you	go	chris	.
what	's	it	taste	of	?
chris	anderson	:	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
michael	pritchard	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
let	's	see	chris	's	program	 through 	 out 	 	the	rest	of	the	show	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	 life 	 saver 	 	bottle	is	used	by	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	around	the	world	.
it	'll	last	for	6,000	 liter 	 s 	 	.
and	when	it	's	 expir 	 ed 	 	,	using	 fail 	 safe 	 	technology	,	the	system	will	shut	off	,	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	user	.
pop	the	 cart 	 ridge 	 	out	.	pop	a	new	one	in	.
it	's	good	for	 an 	 other 	 	6,000	 liter 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	look	at	the	 application 	 s 	 	.
 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	in	a	crisis	,	what	do	we	do	?
we	ship	water	.
then	,	after	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	,	we	set	up	 camp 	 s 	 	.
and	people	are	 force 	 d 	 	to	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 camp 	 s 	 	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	safe	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	20,000	people	 congreg 	 ate 	 	in	a	camp	?
 disease 	 s 	 	spread	.	more	 resource 	 s 	 	are	 requir 	 ed 	 	.
the	problem	just	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	self	-	 perpetu 	 ating 	 	.
but	by	 think 	 ing 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	 ship 	 ping 	 	these	,	people	can	stay	put	.
they	can	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 steril 	 e 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	,	and	start	to	get	on	with	 re 	 building 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
now	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 requir 	 e 	 	a	natural	disaster	for	 th 	 is 	 	to	work	.
using	the	old	 think 	 ing 	 	,	of	national	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	pipe	work	,	is	too	expensive	.
when	you	run	the	 number 	 s 	 	on	a	 calcul 	 ator 	 	,	you	run	out	of	noughts	.
so	here	is	the	``	 think 	 ing 	 	different	``	bit	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 ship 	 ping 	 	water	,	and	using	man	-	made	 process 	 es 	 	to	do	it	,	let	's	use	mother	nature	.	she	's	got	a	fantastic	system	.
she	 pick 	 s 	 	the	water	up	from	there	,	 desalinate 	 s 	 	it	,	for	free	,	 transport 	 s 	 	it	over	there	,	and	 dump 	 s 	 	it	onto	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	 river 	 s 	 	,	and	 stream 	 s 	 	.
and	where	do	people	live	?	near	water	.
all	we	've	go	to	do	is	make	it	 steril 	 e 	 	.	how	do	we	do	that	?
well	,	we	could	use	the	 life 	 saver 	 	bottle	.
or	we	could	use	one	of	these	.
the	same	technology	,	in	a	jerry	can	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	process	25,000	 liter 	 s 	 	of	water	;	that	's	good	 en 	 ough 	 	for	a	family	of	four	,	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	how	much	 do 	 es 	 	it	cost	?
about	half	a	cent	a	day	to	run	.
thank	you	.
so	,	by	 think 	 ing 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	 process 	 ing 	 	water	at	the	point	of	use	,	 mother 	 s 	 	and	children	no	 long 	 er 	 	have	to	walk	four	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	to	collect	 the 	 ir 	 	water	.
they	can	get	it	from	a	source	 near 	 by 	 	.
so	with	just	eight	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	we	can	hit	the	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	goal	's	target	of	 halv 	 ing 	 	the	number	of	people	 with 	 out 	 	access	to	safe	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
to	put	that	 in 	 to 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	the	u.k.	government	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	about	12	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	a	year	on	foreign	aid	.
but	why	stop	there	?
with	20	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	can	have	access	to	safe	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
so	the	three	-	and	-	a	-	half	billion	people	that	suffer	every	year	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	and	the	two	million	 kid 	 s 	 	that	die	every	year	,	will	live	.
thank	you	.
