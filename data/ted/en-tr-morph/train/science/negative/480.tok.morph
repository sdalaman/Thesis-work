the	new	me	is	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	people	used	to	say	,	``	norman	's	ok	,	but	if	you	 follow 	 ed 	 	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	would	be	 us 	 able 	 	but	it	would	be	 ug 	 ly 	 	.	``
well	,	i	did	n't	have	that	in	mind	,	so	...
 th 	 is 	 	is	neat	.
thank	you	for	setting	up	my	 dis 	 play 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	's	just	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
and	i	have	n't	the	 s 	 light 	 est 	 	idea	of	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	or	what	it	's	good	for	,	but	i	want	it	.
and	that	's	my	new	life	.
my	new	life	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	what	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	about	,	and	``	 pre 	 tty 	 	,	``	and	``	 emotion 	 s 	 	.	``
the	new	me	is	all	about	making	 thing 	 s 	 	kind	of	neat	and	 f 	 un 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	philippe	starck	 juice 	 r 	 	,	 produce 	 d 	 	by	alessi	.
it	's	just	neat	;	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.	it	's	so	much	 f 	 un 	 	i	have	it	in	my	house	--	but	i	have	it	in	the	 entry 	 way 	 	,	i	do	n't	use	it	to	make	juice	.
in	fact	,	i	 b 	 ought 	 	the	gold	-	plated	special	 ed 	 ition 	 	and	it	 come 	 s 	 	with	a	little	slip	of	paper	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	do	n't	use	 th 	 is 	 	 juice 	 r 	 	to	make	juice	.	``
the	acid	will	ruin	the	gold	 plat 	 ing 	 	.
so	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	took	a	 car 	 ton 	 	of	 o 	 range 	 	juice	and	i	 pour 	 ed 	 	it	in	the	glass	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
 be 	 neath 	 	it	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	knife	.
it	's	a	global	cutting	knife	made	in	japan	.
first	of	all	,	look	at	the	shape	--	it	's	just	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	look	at	.
second	of	all	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 balanc 	 ed 	 	:	it	 hold 	 s 	 	well	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	well	.
and	third	of	all	,	it	's	so	sharp	,	it	just	 cut 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 de 	 light 	 	to	use	.
and	so	it	's	got	 every 	 thing 	 	,	right	?
it	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	it	's	functional	.
and	i	can	tell	you	 st 	 ories 	 	about	it	,	which	 make 	 s 	 	it	 reflect 	 ive 	 	,	and	so	you	'll	see	i	have	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	emotion	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	three	 component 	 s 	 	.
hiroshi	ishii	and	his	group	at	the	mit	media	lab	took	a	ping	-	pong	table	and	 place 	 d 	 	a	 project 	 or 	 	above	it	,	and	on	the	ping	-	pong	table	they	 project 	 ed 	 	an	image	of	water	with	fish	 swimm 	 ing 	 	in	it	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	play	ping	-	pong	,	 when 	 ever 	 	the	ball	 hit 	 s 	 	part	of	the	table	,	the	 ripple 	 s 	 	spread	out	and	the	fish	run	away	.
but	of	course	,	then	the	ball	 hit 	 s 	 	the	other	side	,	the	 ripple 	 s 	 	hit	the	--	poor	fish	,	they	ca	n't	find	any	peace	and	quiet	.
is	that	a	good	way	to	play	ping	-	pong	?
no	.	but	is	it	 f 	 un 	 	?
 yea 	 h 	 	!	 yea 	 h 	 	.
or	look	at	google	.
if	you	type	in	,	oh	say	,	``	emotion	and	design	,	``	you	get	10	 page 	 s 	 	of	 result 	 s 	 	.
so	google	just	took	 the 	 ir 	 	logo	and	they	spread	it	out	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	you	got	73,000	 result 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	through	20.	next	,	``	they	just	give	you	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	o	's	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	 page 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	and	subtle	.
i	bet	a	lot	of	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	it	and	never	 notice 	 d 	 	it	.
that	's	the	 sub 	 conscious 	 	mind	that	sort	of	 notice 	 s 	 	it	--	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	kind	of	 pleas 	 ant 	 	and	you	did	n't	know	why	.
and	it	's	just	clever	.
and	of	course	,	what	's	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	good	is	,	if	you	type	``	design	and	emotion	,	``	the	first	 respons 	 e 	 	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	10	 page 	 s 	 	is	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
now	,	the	weird	thing	is	google	lies	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	i	type	``	design	and	emotion	,	``	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	do	n't	need	the	'	and	.	'	we	do	it	 any 	 way 	 	.	``
so	,	ok	.
so	i	type	``	design	emotion	``	and	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	was	n't	first	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	was	third	.
oh	well	,	different	story	.
there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	review	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	about	the	mini	cooper	 auto 	 mobile 	 	.
it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	car	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 fault 	 s 	 	.
buy	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
it	's	so	much	 f 	 un 	 	to	drive	.	``
and	if	you	look	at	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	car	--	i	mean	,	i	 love 	 d 	 	it	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	it	,	i	 rent 	 ed 	 	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	me	taking	a	picture	while	my	son	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	--	and	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	car	,	the	whole	design	is	 f 	 un 	 	.
it	's	round	,	it	's	neat	.
the	 control 	 s 	 	work	 wonder 	 fully 	 	.
so	that	's	my	new	life	;	it	's	all	about	 f 	 un 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	 pleas 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	work	better	,	and	that	never	made	any	sense	to	me	 un 	 til 	 	i	 final 	 ly 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	--	look	...
i	'm	going	to	put	a	plank	on	the	ground	.
so	,	imagine	i	have	a	plank	about	two	feet	wide	and	30	feet	long	and	i	'm	going	to	walk	on	it	,	and	you	see	i	can	walk	on	it	 with 	 out 	 	looking	,	i	can	go	back	and	forth	and	i	can	jump	up	and	down	.
no	problem	.
now	i	'm	going	to	put	the	plank	300	feet	in	the	air	--	and	i	'm	not	going	to	go	near	it	,	thank	you	.
 intens 	 e 	 	fear	 paralyze 	 s 	 	you	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 s 	 	the	way	the	brain	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	,	paul	saffo	,	before	his	talk	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	it	down	 un 	 til 	 	just	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	or	 hour 	 s 	 	before	the	talk	,	and	that	 anxie 	 ty 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	in	 caus 	 ing 	 	him	to	focus	.
that	's	what	fear	and	 anxie 	 ty 	 	 do 	 es 	 	;	it	 cause 	 s 	 	you	to	be	--	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	depth	-	first	 process 	 ing 	 	--	to	focus	,	not	be	 distract 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	could	n't	force	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	that	.
now	some	people	can	--	circus	 work 	 ers 	 	,	steel	 work 	 ers 	 	.
but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 s 	 	the	way	you	think	.
and	then	,	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	,	alice	isen	,	did	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	experiment	.
she	 br 	 ought 	 	 student 	 s 	 	in	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	,	she	'd	 br 	 ing 	 	people	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	,	and	there	'd	be	a	string	 hang 	 ing 	 	down	here	and	a	string	 hang 	 ing 	 	down	here	.
it	was	an	empty	room	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	a	table	with	a	bunch	of	crap	on	it	--	some	 paper 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	and	stuff	.
and	she	'd	 br 	 ing 	 	them	in	,	and	she	'd	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	iq	test	and	it	 determine 	 s 	 	how	well	you	do	in	life	.
would	you	tie	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 string 	 s 	 	together	?	``
so	they	'd	take	one	string	and	they	'd	pull	it	over	here	and	they	could	n't	reach	the	other	string	.
still	ca	n't	reach	it	.
and	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	could	solve	it	.
you	 br 	 ing 	 	in	a	second	group	of	people	,	and	you	say	,	``	oh	,	before	we	start	,	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	box	of	 can 	 dy 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	eat	 can 	 dy 	 	.
would	you	like	the	box	of	 can 	 dy 	 	?	``
and	 turn 	 s 	 	out	they	 like 	 d 	 	it	,	and	it	made	them	happy	--	not	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	,	but	a	little	bit	of	happy	.
and	guess	what	--	they	 solve 	 d 	 	the	problem	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	when	you	're	 anx 	 ious 	 	you	squirt	neural	 transmit 	 ter 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	,	which	 focus 	 es 	 	you	 make 	 s 	 	you	depth	-	first	.
and	when	you	're	happy	--	what	we	call	positive	valence	--	you	squirt	dopamine	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pre 	 frontal 	 	 lobe 	 s 	 	,	which	 make 	 s 	 	you	a	 bread 	 th 	 	-	first	problem	 solve 	 r 	 	:	you	're	more	susceptible	to	 interrupt 	 ion 	 	;	you	do	out	-	of	-	the	-	box	 think 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	what	 brain 	 storm 	 ing 	 	is	about	,	right	?
with	 brain 	 storm 	 ing 	 	we	make	you	happy	,	we	play	 game 	 s 	 	,	and	we	say	,	``	no	 critic 	 ism 	 	,	``	and	you	get	all	these	weird	,	neat	 idea 	 s 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	if	that	's	how	you	 al 	 ways 	 	 we 	 re 	 	you	'd	never	get	any	work	 d 	 one 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	'd	be	 work 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	and	say	,	``	oh	,	i	got	a	new	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.	``
so	to	get	work	 d 	 one 	 	,	you	've	got	to	set	a	 dead 	 line 	 	,	right	?
you	've	got	be	 anx 	 ious 	 	.
the	brain	 work 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	if	you	're	happy	.	 thing 	 s 	 	work	better	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	more	creative	.
you	get	a	little	problem	,	you	say	,	``	ah	,	i	'll	figure	it	out	.	``
no	big	deal	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	i	call	the	visceral	level	of	 process 	 ing 	 	,	and	there	will	be	visceral	-	level	design	.
biology	--	we	have	co	-	 adapt 	 ed 	 	through	biology	to	like	bright	 color 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	good	that	 mammal 	 s 	 	and	 prim 	 ates 	 	like	 fruit 	 s 	 	and	bright	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	eat	the	fruit	and	you	 there 	 by 	 	spread	the	seed	.
there	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	amount	of	stuff	that	's	built	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	.
we	 dis 	 like 	 	bitter	 taste 	 s 	 	,	we	 dis 	 like 	 	loud	 sound 	 s 	 	,	we	 dis 	 like 	 	hot	 temperature 	 s 	 	,	cold	 temperature 	 s 	 	.
we	 dis 	 like 	 	 s 	 cold 	 ing 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	.	we	 dis 	 like 	 	 frown 	 ing 	 	 face 	 s 	 	;	we	like	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
so	that	's	the	visceral	level	.
in	design	,	you	can	express	visceral	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	ways	,	like	the	choice	of	type	 font 	 s 	 	and	the	red	for	hot	,	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
or	the	1963	jaguar	:	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	crummy	car	,	 fall 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	all	the	time	,	but	the	 owner 	 s 	 	love	it	.
and	it	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	--	it	's	in	the	museum	of	modern	art	.
a	water	bottle	:	you	buy	it	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	bottle	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	water	.
and	when	people	are	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	they	do	n't	throw	it	away	.
they	keep	it	for	--	you	know	,	it	's	like	the	old	wine	 bottle 	 s 	 	,	you	keep	it	for	 decor 	 ation 	 	or	 may 	 be 	 	fill	it	with	water	 aga 	 in 	 	,	which	 prove 	 s 	 	it	's	not	the	water	.
it	's	all	about	the	visceral	experience	.
the	middle	level	of	 process 	 ing 	 	is	the	 behavior 	 al 	 	level	and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	where	most	of	our	stuff	 get 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
visceral	is	 sub 	 conscious 	 	,	you	're	 un 	 aware 	 	of	it	.
 behavior 	 al 	 	is	 sub 	 conscious 	 	,	you	're	 un 	 aware 	 	of	it	.
 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	we	do	is	 sub 	 conscious 	 	.
i	'm	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	the	stage	--	i	'm	not	 attend 	 ing 	 	to	the	control	of	my	 leg 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	;	most	of	my	talk	is	 sub 	 conscious 	 	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 rehears 	 ed 	 	and	thought	about	a	lot	.
most	of	what	we	do	is	 sub 	 conscious 	 	.
 autom 	 atic 	 	behavior	--	 skill 	 ed 	 	behavior	--	is	 sub 	 conscious 	 	,	controlled	by	the	 behavior 	 al 	 	side	.
and	 behavior 	 al 	 	design	is	all	about	 feel 	 ing 	 	in	control	,	which	 include 	 s 	 	 us 	 ability 	 	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	feel	and	heft	.
that	's	why	the	global	knives	are	so	neat	.
they	're	so	 nice 	 ly 	 	 balanc 	 ed 	 	,	so	sharp	,	that	you	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	you	're	in	control	of	the	cutting	.
or	,	just	 driv 	 ing 	 	a	high	-	performance	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	car	over	a	 demand 	 ing 	 	 cur 	 b 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	you	are	in	complete	control	of	the	environment	.
or	the	sensual	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kohler	shower	,	a	 water 	 fall 	 	shower	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 knob 	 s 	 	 be 	 neath 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 shower 	 head 	 s 	 	.
it	will	squirt	you	all	around	and	you	can	stay	in	that	shower	for	 hour 	 s 	 	--	and	not	waste	water	,	by	the	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 re 	 circul 	 ates 	 	the	same	 dirt 	 y 	 	water	.
or	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	neat	teapot	i	found	at	high	tea	at	the	four	 season 	 s 	 	hotel	in	chicago	.
it	's	a	ronnefeldt	 tilt 	 ing 	 	teapot	.
that	's	kind	of	what	the	teapot	 look 	 s 	 	like	but	the	way	you	use	it	is	you	lay	it	on	 it 	 s 	 	back	,	and	you	put	tea	in	,	and	then	you	fill	it	with	water	.
the	water	then	 seep 	 s 	 	over	the	tea	.
and	the	tea	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	to	the	right	--	the	tea	is	to	the	right	of	 th 	 is 	 	line	.
there	's	a	little	ledge	 in 	 side 	 	,	so	the	tea	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	and	the	water	is	 fill 	 ing 	 	it	up	like	that	.
and	when	the	tea	is	ready	,	or	 al 	 most 	 	ready	,	you	tilt	it	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	the	tea	is	 partial 	 ly 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	while	it	 complete 	 s 	 	the	 brew 	 ing 	 	.
and	when	it	's	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	you	put	it	 vert 	 ically 	 	,	and	now	the	tea	is	--	you	remember	--	above	 th 	 is 	 	line	and	the	water	 on 	 ly 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	here	--	and	so	it	 keep 	 s 	 	the	tea	out	.
on	top	of	that	,	it	 communicate 	 s 	 	,	which	is	what	emotion	 do 	 es 	 	.
emotion	is	all	about	 act 	 ing 	 	;	emotion	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 act 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	safe	in	the	world	.
cognition	is	about	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	emotion	is	about	 interpret 	 ing 	 	it	--	 say 	 ing 	 	good	,	bad	,	safe	,	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	and	 get 	 ting 	 	us	ready	to	act	,	which	is	why	the	 muscle 	 s 	 	tense	or	relax	.
and	that	's	why	we	can	tell	the	emotion	of	 some 	 body 	 	else	--	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 muscle 	 s 	 	are	 act 	 ing 	 	,	 sub 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	we	've	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	make	the	 fa 	 cial 	 	 muscle 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	rich	with	emotion	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	if	you	like	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 signal 	 s 	 	the	 wait 	 er 	 	that	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	 finish 	 ed 	 	.	see	--	 up 	 right 	 	.	``
and	the	 wait 	 er 	 	can	come	by	and	say	,	``	would	you	like	more	water	?	``
it	's	kind	of	neat	.	what	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	design	.
and	the	third	level	is	 reflect 	 ive 	 	,	which	is	,	if	you	like	the	 super 	 ego 	 	,	it	's	a	little	part	of	the	brain	that	 ha 	 s 	 	no	control	over	what	you	do	,	no	control	over	the	--	 do 	 es 	 	n't	see	the	 sense 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	control	the	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	over	what	's	going	on	.
it	's	that	little	voice	in	your	head	that	's	 watch 	 ing 	 	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	that	's	good	.	that	's	bad	.	``
or	,	``	why	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?	i	do	n't	understand	.	``
it	's	that	little	voice	in	your	head	that	's	the	seat	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
here	's	a	great	 reflect 	 ive 	 	product	.
 owner 	 s 	 	of	the	hummer	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	i	've	owned	 man 	 y 	 	 car 	 s 	 	in	my	life	--	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 ex 	 otic 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	but	never	have	i	had	a	car	that	 attract 	 ed 	 	so	much	attention	.	``
it	's	about	attention	.	it	's	about	 the 	 ir 	 	image	,	not	about	the	car	.
if	you	want	a	more	positive	model	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	gm	car	.
and	the	reason	you	might	buy	it	now	is	 be 	 cause 	 	you	care	about	the	environment	.
and	you	'll	buy	it	to	protect	the	environment	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	first	few	 car 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	expensive	and	not	 perfect 	 ed 	 	.
but	that	's	 reflect 	 ive 	 	design	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
or	an	expensive	watch	,	so	you	can	impress	people	--	``	oh	gee	,	i	did	n't	know	you	had	that	watch	.	``
 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	which	is	a	 pur 	 e 	 	 behavior 	 al 	 	watch	,	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	 keep 	 s 	 	better	time	than	the	$	13,000	watch	i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
but	it	's	 ug 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	clear	don	norman	watch	.
