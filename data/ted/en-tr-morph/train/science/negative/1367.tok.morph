i	'm	going	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	about	saving	more	,	but	not	 to 	 day 	 	,	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 s 	 ave 	 	more	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
it	's	a	program	that	richard	thaler	from	the	university	of	chicago	and	i	 de 	 vis 	 ed 	 	 may 	 be 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	program	,	in	a	sense	,	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	how	we	could	 re 	 ally 	 	use	 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	.
now	you	might	ask	,	what	is	 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	?
so	let	's	think	about	how	we	manage	our	money	.
let	's	start	with	 mortgage 	 s 	 	.
it	's	kind	of	a	 re 	 cent 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	u.s	.
a	lot	of	people	buy	the	 big 	 gest 	 	house	they	can	afford	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	that	.
and	then	they	 fore 	 close 	 	.
and	then	they	blame	the	 bank 	 s 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	the	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	who	 g 	 ave 	 	them	the	 mortgage 	 s 	 	.
let	's	 al 	 so 	 	think	about	how	we	manage	 risk 	 s 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	the	stock	market	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	about	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 market 	 s 	 	did	well	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	risk	 taker 	 s 	 	,	of	course	.
then	market	 stock 	 s 	 	 s 	 e 	 ize 	 	and	we	're	like	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	.
these	 loss 	 es 	 	,	they	feel	,	 emotion 	 ally 	 	,	they	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	what	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	thought	about	it	when	 market 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	up	.	``
so	we	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	 do 	 ing 	 	a	great	job	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	risk	taking	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	iphones	?
 any 	 one 	 	?	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
i	would	bet	 man 	 y 	 	more	of	you	 insur 	 e 	 	your	iphone	--	you	're	 im 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	 insur 	 ance 	 	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	 extend 	 ed 	 	 warrant 	 y 	 	.
what	if	you	lose	your	iphone	?
what	if	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 kid 	 s 	 	?
 any 	 one 	 	?
keep	your	 hand 	 s 	 	up	if	you	have	sufficient	life	 insur 	 ance 	 	.
i	see	a	lot	of	 hand 	 s 	 	coming	down	.
i	would	predict	,	if	you	're	a	 represent 	 ative 	 	 s 	 ample 	 	,	that	 man 	 y 	 	more	of	you	 insur 	 e 	 	your	iphones	than	your	 live 	 s 	 	,	even	when	you	have	 kid 	 s 	 	.
we	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	that	well	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 insur 	 ance 	 	.
the	average	american	 house 	 hold 	 	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	on	 lot 	 ter 	 ies 	 	.
and	i	know	it	 sound 	 s 	 	crazy	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 s 	 pend 	 	a	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	on	 lot 	 ter 	 ies 	 	?
no	one	.
so	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	the	people	not	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	are	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	more	than	a	thousand	to	get	the	average	to	a	thousand	.
low	-	income	people	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	more	than	a	thousand	on	 lot 	 ter 	 ies 	 	.
so	where	 do 	 es 	 	it	take	us	?
we	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	a	great	job	 man 	 aging 	 	money	.
 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	combination	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	and	 economic 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	money	 mistak 	 es 	 	people	make	.
and	i	can	keep	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	for	the	12	 minute 	 s 	 	and	53	 second 	 s 	 	that	i	have	left	and	make	 f 	 un 	 	of	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	ways	we	manage	money	,	and	at	the	end	you	're	going	to	ask	,	``	how	can	we	help	people	?	``
and	that	's	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	focus	on	 to 	 day 	 	.
how	do	we	take	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	money	 mistak 	 es 	 	people	make	,	and	then	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	 behavior 	 al 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 behavior 	 al 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	?
and	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	 s 	 ave 	 	more	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
i	want	to	address	the	issue	of	 saving 	 s 	 	.
we	have	on	the	screen	a	 represent 	 ative 	 	 s 	 ample 	 	of	100	americans	.
and	we	're	going	to	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	saving	behavior	.
first	thing	to	notice	is	,	half	of	them	do	not	even	have	access	to	a	401	plan	.
they	can	not	make	 saving 	 s 	 	easy	.
they	can	not	have	money	go	away	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 pay 	 check 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	401	plan	before	they	see	it	,	before	they	can	touch	it	.
what	about	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	half	of	the	people	?
some	of	them	elect	not	to	 s 	 ave 	 	.
they	're	just	too	 laz 	 y 	 	.
they	never	get	around	to	logging	 in 	 to 	 	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	17	 click 	 s 	 	to	join	the	401	plan	.
and	then	they	have	to	decide	how	they	're	going	to	invest	in	 the 	 ir 	 	52	 choice 	 s 	 	,	and	they	never	heard	about	what	is	a	money	market	fund	.
and	they	get	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	and	the	just	do	n't	join	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	end	up	saving	to	a	401	plan	?
one	third	of	americans	.
two	 third 	 s 	 	are	not	saving	now	.
are	they	saving	 en 	 ough 	 	?
take	out	 t 	 hose 	 	who	say	they	 s 	 ave 	 	too	little	.
one	out	of	10	are	saving	 en 	 ough 	 	.
nine	out	of	10	either	can	not	 s 	 ave 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	401	plan	,	decide	not	to	 s 	 ave 	 	--	or	do	n't	decide	--	or	 s 	 ave 	 	too	little	.
we	think	we	have	a	problem	of	people	saving	too	much	.
let	's	look	at	that	.
we	have	one	person	--	well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	're	going	to	slice	him	in	half	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	less	than	one	percent	.
 rough 	 ly 	 	half	a	percent	of	americans	feel	that	they	 s 	 ave 	 	too	much	.
what	are	we	going	to	do	about	it	?
that	's	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	focus	on	.
we	have	to	understand	why	people	are	not	saving	,	and	then	we	can	 hope 	 fully 	 	flip	the	 behavior 	 al 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 behavior 	 al 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	,	and	then	see	how	 power 	 ful 	 	it	might	be	.
so	let	me	divert	for	a	second	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	going	to	identify	the	 problem 	 s 	 	,	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	the	 behavior 	 al 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	that	prevent	people	from	saving	.
i	'm	going	to	divert	and	talk	about	 banana 	 s 	 	and	chocolate	.
suppose	we	had	 an 	 other 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	ted	event	next	week	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	break	there	would	be	a	snack	and	you	could	 choos 	 e 	 	 banana 	 s 	 	or	chocolate	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	think	you	would	like	to	have	 banana 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	hypothetical	ted	event	next	week	?
who	would	go	for	 banana 	 s 	 	?
 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
i	predict	 scientific 	 ally 	 	74	percent	of	you	will	go	for	 banana 	 s 	 	.
well	that	's	at	 l 	 east 	 	what	one	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 predict 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	count	down	the	 day 	 s 	 	and	see	what	people	 end 	 ed 	 	up	eating	.
the	same	people	that	 imagin 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	eating	the	 banana 	 s 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	eating	 chocolate 	 s 	 	a	week	 lat 	 er 	 	.
self	-	control	is	not	a	problem	in	the	future	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	problem	now	when	the	chocolate	is	next	to	us	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	have	to	do	with	time	and	 saving 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	issue	of	 im 	 mediate 	 	 grat 	 ification 	 	?
or	 a 	 s 	 	some	 economist 	 s 	 	call	it	,	present	bias	.
we	think	about	saving	.	we	know	we	should	be	saving	.
we	know	we	'll	do	it	next	year	,	but	 to 	 day 	 	let	us	go	and	 s 	 pend 	 	.
christmas	is	coming	,	we	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	buy	a	lot	of	 gift 	 s 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	we	know	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	issue	of	present	bias	 cause 	 s 	 	us	to	think	about	saving	,	but	end	up	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	.
let	me	now	talk	about	 an 	 other 	 	 behavior 	 al 	 	obstacle	to	saving	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 in 	 ertia 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	little	 divers 	 ion 	 	to	the	 top 	 ic 	 	of	organ	 don 	 ation 	 	.
 wonder 	 ful 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 compar 	 ing 	 	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
we	're	going	to	look	at	two	similar	 count 	 ries 	 	,	germany	and	austria	.
and	in	germany	,	if	you	would	like	to	 don 	 ate 	 	your	 organ 	 s 	 	--	god	forbid	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	 happen 	 s 	 	to	you	--	when	you	get	your	 driv 	 ing 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	or	an	i.d	.	,	you	check	the	box	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	would	like	to	 don 	 ate 	 	my	 organ 	 s 	 	.	``
not	 man 	 y 	 	people	like	 check 	 ing 	 	boxes	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	effort	.	you	need	to	think	.
twelve	percent	do	.
austria	,	a	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	country	,	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	similar	,	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	.
what	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	?
well	,	you	still	have	choice	.
you	will	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	you	want	to	 don 	 ate 	 	your	 organ 	 s 	 	or	not	.
but	when	you	get	your	 driv 	 ing 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	,	you	check	the	box	if	you	do	not	want	to	 don 	 ate 	 	your	organ	.
 no 	 body 	 	 check 	 s 	 	boxes	.
that	's	kind	of	too	much	effort	.
one	percent	check	the	box	.	the	rest	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	common	.
not	 man 	 y 	 	people	check	boxes	.
what	are	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	to	saving	 live 	 s 	 	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	?
in	germany	,	12	percent	check	the	box	.
twelve	percent	are	organ	 donor 	 s 	 	.
huge	 short 	 age 	 	of	 organ 	 s 	 	,	god	forbid	,	if	you	need	one	.
in	austria	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 no 	 body 	 	 check 	 s 	 	the	box	.
 there 	 fore 	 	,	99	percent	of	people	are	organ	 donor 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 ertia 	 	,	lack	of	action	.
what	is	the	default	setting	if	people	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	if	they	keep	 procrastin 	 ating 	 	,	if	they	do	n't	check	the	boxes	?
 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
we	're	going	to	talk	about	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	people	are	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	and	 scar 	 ed 	 	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	401	 choice 	 s 	 	.
are	we	going	to	make	them	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	join	the	plan	,	or	are	they	going	to	be	left	out	?
in	too	 man 	 y 	 	401	 plan 	 s 	 	,	if	people	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	they	're	not	saving	for	 retire 	 ment 	 	,	if	they	do	n't	check	the	box	.
and	 check 	 ing 	 	the	box	 take 	 s 	 	effort	.
so	we	've	 chat 	 ted 	 	about	a	couple	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
one	more	before	we	flip	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 monkey 	 s 	 	and	 apple 	 s 	 	.
no	,	no	,	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	 stud 	 y 	 	and	it	's	got	a	lot	to	do	with	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	.
one	group	of	 monkey 	 s 	 	 get 	 s 	 	an	apple	,	they	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	happy	.
the	other	group	 get 	 s 	 	two	 apple 	 s 	 	,	one	is	taken	away	.
they	still	have	an	apple	left	.
they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	mad	.
why	have	you	taken	our	apple	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	loss	 a 	 version 	 	.
we	hate	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	stuff	,	even	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	a	lot	of	risk	.
you	would	hate	to	go	to	the	atm	,	take	out	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	notice	that	you	lost	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	$	20	 bill 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	 any 	 thing 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	20	 dollar 	 s 	 	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	quick	lunch	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	loss	 a 	 version 	 	 kick 	 s 	 	in	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 saving 	 s 	 	too	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	,	 ment 	 ally 	 	and	 emotion 	 ally 	 	and	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	frame	 saving 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	loss	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	to	cut	my	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 saving 	 s 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	you	think	about	 im 	 mediate 	 	 grat 	 ification 	 	,	and	the	 chocolate 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 banana 	 s 	 	,	it	's	just	 pain 	 ful 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	now	.
it	's	a	lot	more	 f 	 un 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	now	.
we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 in 	 ertia 	 	and	organ	 don 	 ations 	 	and	 check 	 ing 	 	the	box	.
if	people	have	to	check	a	lot	of	boxes	to	join	a	401	plan	,	they	're	going	to	keep	 procrastin 	 ating 	 	and	not	join	.
and	last	,	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	loss	 a 	 version 	 	,	and	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	and	the	 apple 	 s 	 	.
if	people	frame	 ment 	 ally 	 	saving	for	 retire 	 ment 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	loss	,	they	're	not	going	to	be	saving	for	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
so	we	've	got	these	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	and	what	richard	thaler	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	--	take	 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	,	make	it	 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	on	 steroid 	 s 	 	or	 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	2.0	or	 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	in	action	--	flip	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
and	we	came	up	with	an	 embarrass 	 ing 	 ly 	 	simple	solution	 call 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	more	,	not	 to 	 day 	 	,	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
how	is	it	going	to	solve	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	we	 chat 	 ted 	 	about	?
if	you	think	about	the	problem	of	 banana 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 chocolate 	 s 	 	,	we	think	we	're	going	to	eat	 banana 	 s 	 	next	week	.
we	think	we	're	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	more	next	year	.
 s 	 ave 	 	more	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	 invit 	 es 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	more	 may 	 be 	 	next	year	--	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	future	when	we	can	imagine	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	eating	 banana 	 s 	 	,	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	more	in	the	community	,	 exercis 	 ing 	 	more	and	 do 	 ing 	 	all	the	right	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	.
now	we	 al 	 so 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 check 	 ing 	 	the	box	and	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	of	taking	action	.
 s 	 ave 	 	more	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	easy	.
it	's	an	 auto 	 pilot 	 	.
once	you	tell	me	you	would	like	to	 s 	 ave 	 	more	in	the	future	,	let	's	say	every	january	you	're	going	to	be	saving	more	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	and	it	's	going	to	go	away	from	your	 pay 	 check 	 	to	the	401	plan	before	you	see	it	,	before	you	touch	it	,	before	you	get	the	issue	of	 im 	 mediate 	 	 grat 	 ification 	 	.
but	what	are	we	going	to	do	about	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	and	loss	 a 	 version 	 	?
next	january	 come 	 s 	 	and	people	might	feel	that	if	they	 s 	 ave 	 	more	,	they	have	to	 s 	 pend 	 	less	,	and	that	's	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
well	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	should	n't	be	just	january	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	should	make	people	 s 	 ave 	 	more	when	they	make	more	money	.
that	way	,	when	they	make	more	money	,	when	they	get	a	pay	raise	,	they	do	n't	have	to	cut	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	.
they	take	a	little	bit	of	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	 pay 	 check 	 	home	and	 s 	 pend 	 	more	--	take	a	little	bit	of	the	 in 	 crease 	 	and	put	it	in	a	401	plan	.
so	that	is	the	program	,	 embarrass 	 ing 	 ly 	 	simple	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	going	to	see	,	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
we	first	 implement 	 ed 	 	it	,	richard	thaler	and	i	,	back	in	1998	.
mid	-	sized	company	in	the	 mid 	 west 	 	,	blue	collar	 employ 	 ees 	 	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	pay	 the 	 ir 	 	 bill 	 s 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	told	us	they	can	not	 s 	 ave 	 	more	right	away	.
saving	more	 to 	 day 	 	is	not	an	option	.
we	 invit 	 ed 	 	them	to	 s 	 ave 	 	three	 percent 	 age 	 	 point 	 s 	 	more	every	time	they	get	a	pay	raise	.
and	here	are	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	a	three	and	a	half	-	year	period	,	four	pay	 raise 	 s 	 	,	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	saving	three	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 pay 	 check 	 	,	three	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	saving	 al 	 most 	 	four	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	,	 al 	 most 	 	14	percent	.
and	there	's	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	chart	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	want	to	just	throw	 number 	 s 	 	in	a	vacuum	.
i	want	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	to	think	about	the	fact	that	saving	four	 time 	 s 	 	more	is	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 life 	 style 	 	that	people	will	be	able	to	afford	.
it	's	real	.
it	's	not	just	 number 	 s 	 	on	a	piece	of	paper	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	with	saving	three	percent	,	people	might	have	to	add	nice	 sneak 	 ers 	 	so	they	can	walk	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	wo	n't	be	able	to	afford	 any 	 thing 	 	else	,	when	they	 s 	 ave 	 	14	percent	they	might	be	able	to	 may 	 be 	 	have	nice	dress	 shoe 	 s 	 	to	walk	to	the	car	to	drive	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	 differ 	 ence 	 	.

it	's	 be 	 en 	 	part	of	the	pension	 protect 	 ion 	 	act	.

let	me	wrap	with	two	key	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	.
one	is	 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 mess 	 age 	 	two	is	there	's	still	a	lot	to	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	tip	of	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	.
if	you	think	about	people	and	 mortgage 	 s 	 	and	 buy 	 ing 	 	 house 	 s 	 	and	then	not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	pay	for	it	,	we	need	to	think	about	that	.
if	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	people	taking	too	much	risk	and	not	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	much	risk	they	're	taking	or	taking	too	little	risk	,	we	need	to	think	about	that	.
if	you	think	about	people	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	a	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	on	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	 ticket 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	think	about	that	.
the	average	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	record	is	in	singapore	.
the	average	 house 	 hold 	 	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	$	4,000	a	year	on	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	 ticket 	 s 	 	.
we	've	got	a	lot	to	do	,	a	lot	to	solve	,	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	 retire 	 ment 	 	area	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	what	people	do	with	 the 	 ir 	 	money	after	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
one	last	question	:	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	feel	 comfort 	 able 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 plan 	 ning 	 	for	 retire 	 ment 	 	you	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	solid	plan	when	you	're	going	to	retire	,	when	you	're	going	to	claim	social	security	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	what	 life 	 style 	 	to	expect	,	how	much	to	 s 	 pend 	 	every	month	so	you	're	not	going	to	run	out	of	money	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	feel	you	have	a	solid	plan	for	the	future	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	post	-	 retire 	 ment 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	.
one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
less	than	three	percent	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	audience	.
 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	 ha 	 s 	 	a	long	way	.
there	's	a	lot	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	make	it	 power 	 ful 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
