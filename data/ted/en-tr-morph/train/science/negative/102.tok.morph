so	i	'm	going	to	speak	about	a	problem	that	i	have	and	that	's	that	i	'm	a	 philosoph 	 er 	 	.
when	i	go	to	a	party	and	people	ask	me	what	do	i	do	and	i	say	,	``	i	'm	a	professor	,	``	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 glaz 	 e 	 	over	.
when	i	go	to	an	academic	 cock 	 tail 	 	party	and	there	are	all	the	 professor 	 s 	 	around	,	they	ask	me	what	field	i	'm	in	and	i	say	,	``	 philosoph 	 y 	 	``	--	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 glaz 	 e 	 	over	.
when	i	go	to	a	 philosoph 	 er 	 	's	party	and	they	ask	me	what	i	work	on	and	i	say	,	``	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	``	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	do	n't	 glaz 	 e 	 	over	--	 the 	 ir 	 	lips	curl	 in 	 to 	 	a	snarl	.
and	i	get	hoots	of	 deris 	 ion 	 	and	 c 	 ack 	 les 	 	and	 grow 	 l 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	think	,	``	that	's	 im 	 possible 	 	!	you	ca	n't	explain	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.	``
the	 ver 	 y 	 	chutzpah	of	 some 	 body 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	that	you	could	explain	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	just	out	of	the	question	.
my	late	,	 lament 	 ed 	 	friend	bob	nozick	,	a	fine	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	in	one	of	his	 book 	 s 	 	,	``	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	 explan 	 ations 	 	,	``	is	 comment 	 ing 	 	on	the	 etho 	 s 	 	of	 philosoph 	 y 	 	--	the	way	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	go	about	 the 	 ir 	 	business	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	``	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	love	rational	argument	.	``
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	it	 seem 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	ideal	argument	for	most	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	is	you	give	your	audience	the	 pre 	 mis 	 es 	 	and	then	you	give	them	the	 in 	 ference 	 s 	 	and	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	and	if	they	do	n't	accept	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	they	die	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	explode	.	``	the	idea	is	to	have	an	argument	that	is	so	 power 	 ful 	 	that	it	 knock 	 s 	 	out	your	 opponent 	 s 	 	.
but	in	fact	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	change	people	's	 mind 	 s 	 	at	all	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	change	people	's	 mind 	 s 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	and	i	 final 	 ly 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	the	reason	for	that	.
the	reason	for	that	is	that	 every 	 body 	 	's	an	expert	on	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
we	heard	the	other	day	that	 every 	 body 	 	's	got	a	strong	opinion	about	video	 game 	 s 	 	.
they	all	have	an	idea	for	a	video	game	,	even	if	they	're	not	 expert 	 s 	 	.
but	they	do	n't	consider	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	on	video	 game 	 s 	 	;	they	've	just	got	strong	 opinion 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	that	people	here	who	work	on	,	say	,	climate	change	and	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	or	on	the	future	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 en 	 counter 	 	people	who	have	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 opinion 	 s 	 	about	what	's	going	to	happen	next	.
but	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	n't	think	of	these	 opinion 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	.
they	're	just	 strong 	 ly 	 	held	 opinion 	 s 	 	.
but	with	regard	to	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	people	seem	to	think	,	each	of	us	 seem 	 s 	 	to	think	,	``	i	am	an	expert	.
 simpl 	 y 	 	by	 be 	 ing 	 	conscious	,	i	know	all	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	so	,	you	tell	them	your	 theor 	 y 	 	and	they	say	,	``	no	,	no	,	that	's	not	the	way	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	!
no	,	you	've	got	it	all	wrong	.	``
and	they	say	 th 	 is 	 	with	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	confidence	.
and	so	what	i	'm	going	to	try	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	to	shake	your	confidence	.	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	--	i	can	feel	it	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	want	to	shake	your	confidence	that	you	know	your	own	 inner 	 most 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	--	that	you	are	,	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 author 	 itative 	 	about	your	own	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
that	's	the	order	of	the	day	here	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	nice	picture	 show 	 s 	 	a	thought	-	balloon	,	a	thought	-	bubble	.
i	think	 every 	 body 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	exhibit	the	stream	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	picture	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	that	's	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
it	's	a	saul	steinberg	of	course	--	it	was	a	new	yorker	cover	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	fellow	here	is	looking	at	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	by	braque	.
that	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	him	of	the	word	 baro 	 que 	 	,	 bar 	 rack 	 	,	bark	,	 poo 	 d 	 le 	 	,	suzanne	r.	--	he	's	off	to	the	 race 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	stream	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	here	and	if	you	follow	it	 a 	 long 	 	,	you	learn	a	lot	about	 th 	 is 	 	man	.
what	i	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	like	about	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	too	,	is	that	steinberg	 ha 	 s 	 	 render 	 ed 	 	the	guy	in	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 point 	 ill 	 ist 	 	style	.
which	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	us	,	 a 	 s 	 	rod	brooks	was	 say 	 ing 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	:	what	we	are	,	what	each	of	us	is	--	what	you	are	,	what	i	am	--	is	 approximate 	 ly 	 	100	trillion	little	cellular	 robot 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	we	're	made	of	.
no	other	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	at	all	.	we	're	just	made	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	about	100	trillion	of	them	.
not	a	single	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	is	conscious	;	not	a	single	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	 know 	 s 	 	who	you	are	,	or	 care 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 how 	 	,	we	have	to	explain	how	when	you	put	together	 team 	 s 	 	,	 arm 	 ies 	 	,	 battalion 	 s 	 	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	little	robotic	 un 	 conscious 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	--	not	so	different	 re 	 ally 	 	from	a	 bacter 	 ium 	 	,	each	one	of	them	--	the	result	is	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	mean	,	just	look	at	it	.
the	content	--	there	's	color	,	there	's	 idea 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 memor 	 ies 	 	,	there	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	.	and	 some 	 how 	 	all	that	content	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	by	the	 bus 	 y 	 	activity	of	 t 	 hose 	 	hoards	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
how	is	that	possible	?	 man 	 y 	 	people	just	think	it	is	n't	possible	at	all	.
they	think	,	``	no	,	there	ca	n't	be	any	sort	of	 natural 	 istic 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 love 	 ly 	 	book	by	a	friend	of	mine	named	lee	siegel	,	who	's	a	professor	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	at	the	university	of	hawaii	,	and	he	's	an	expert	 magic 	 ian 	 	,	and	an	expert	on	the	street	magic	of	india	,	which	is	what	 th 	 is 	 	book	is	about	,	and	there	's	a	 pass 	 age 	 	in	it	which	i	would	love	to	share	with	you	.
it	 speak 	 s 	 	so	 eloquent 	 ly 	 	to	the	problem	.
``	'	i	'm	writing	a	book	on	magic	,	'	i	explain	,	and	i	'm	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	'	real	magic	?	'	by	'	real	magic	,	'	people	mean	 miracle 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 au 	 matur 	 gical 	 	 act 	 s 	 	,	and	 super 	 natural 	 	 power 	 s 	 	.
'	no	,	'	i	answer	.	'	 con 	 jur 	 ing 	 	 trick 	 s 	 	,	not	real	magic	.	'	'	real	magic	,	'	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 refer 	 s 	 	to	the	magic	that	is	not	real	;	while	the	magic	that	is	real	,	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	is	not	real	magic	.	``
now	,	that	's	the	way	a	lot	of	people	feel	about	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
real	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	not	a	bag	of	 trick 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	going	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	bag	of	 trick 	 s 	 	,	then	it	's	not	real	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	marvin	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	other	people	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	a	bag	of	 trick 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	a	lot	of	people	are	just	left	 complete 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 satisfied 	 	and	 inc 	 red 	 ul 	 ous 	 	when	i	attempt	to	explain	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	problem	.	so	i	have	to	do	a	little	bit	of	the	sort	of	work	that	a	lot	of	you	wo	n't	like	,	for	the	same	reason	that	you	do	n't	like	to	see	a	magic	trick	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	you	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	,	if	 some 	 body 	 	--	some	smart	 al 	 e 	 ck 	 	--	 start 	 s 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	how	a	 part 	 icular 	 	magic	trick	is	 d 	 one 	 	,	you	sort	of	want	to	block	your	 ear 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	no	,	no	,	i	do	n't	want	to	know	!
do	n't	take	the	thrill	of	it	away	.	i	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	 myst 	 ified 	 	.
do	n't	tell	me	the	answer	.	``
a	lot	of	people	feel	that	way	about	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	'm	sorry	if	i	impose	some	 clar 	 ity 	 	,	some	 understand 	 ing 	 	on	you	.
you	'd	better	 leav 	 e 	 	now	if	you	do	n't	want	to	know	some	of	these	 trick 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	not	going	to	explain	it	all	to	you	.
i	'm	going	to	do	what	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	do	.
here	's	how	a	 philosoph 	 er 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	the	sawing	-	the	-	 lad 	 y 	 	-	in	-	half	trick	.
you	know	the	sawing	-	the	-	 lad 	 y 	 	-	in	-	half	trick	?
the	 philosoph 	 er 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	explain	to	you	how	that	's	 d 	 one 	 	.
you	see	,	the	 magic 	 ian 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	saw	the	 lad 	 y 	 	in	half	.	``
``	he	 mere 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	you	think	that	he	 do 	 es 	 	.	``
and	you	say	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	and	how	 do 	 es 	 	he	do	that	?	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	,	that	's	not	my	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	i	'm	sorry	.	``
so	now	i	'm	going	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	how	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	explain	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
but	i	'm	going	to	try	to	 al 	 so 	 	show	you	that	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 marvel 	 ous 	 	--	your	own	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	may	have	thought	it	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	,	by	the	way	,	that	lee	siegel	 talk 	 s 	 	about	in	his	book	.
he	 marvel 	 s 	 	at	how	he	'll	do	a	magic	show	,	and	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	people	will	 s 	 wear 	 	they	saw	him	do	x	,	y	,	and	z.	he	never	did	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
he	did	n't	even	try	to	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
people	's	 memor 	 ies 	 	 infla 	 te 	 	what	they	think	they	saw	.
and	the	same	is	true	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
now	,	let	's	see	if	 th 	 is 	 	will	work	.	all	right	.	let	's	just	watch	 th 	 is 	 	.
watch	it	 care 	 fully 	 	.
i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	with	a	young	computer	-	 anim 	 ator 	 	 document 	 arian 	 	named	nick	deamer	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	demo	that	he	's	 d 	 one 	 	for	me	,	part	of	a	 large 	 r 	 	project	some	of	you	may	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
we	're	looking	for	a	 back 	 er 	 	.
it	's	a	feature	-	length	 document 	 ary 	 	on	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
ok	,	now	,	you	all	saw	what	 change 	 d 	 	,	right	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 notice 	 d 	 	that	every	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 square 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	color	?
every	one	.	i	'll	just	show	you	by	running	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
even	when	you	know	that	they	're	all	going	to	change	color	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	notice	.	you	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 concent 	 rate 	 	to	pick	up	any	of	the	 change 	 s 	 	at	all	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	one	of	 man 	 y 	 	--	of	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	's	now	 be 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	.
it	's	one	that	i	 predict 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	page	or	two	of	my	1991	book	,	``	 conscious 	 ness 	 	 explain 	 ed 	 	,	``	where	i	 s 	 aid 	 	if	you	did	 experiment 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	,	you	'd	find	that	people	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 able 	 	to	pick	up	 re 	 ally 	 	large	 change 	 s 	 	.
if	there	's	time	at	the	end	,	i	'll	show	you	the	much	more	 dramat 	 ic 	 	case	.
now	,	how	can	it	be	that	there	are	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 change 	 s 	 	going	on	,	and	that	we	're	not	aware	of	them	?
well	,	 ear 	 lier 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	jeff	hawkins	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	the	way	your	eye	saccades	,	the	way	your	eye	 move 	 s 	 	around	three	or	four	 time 	 s 	 	a	second	.
he	did	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	speed	.	your	eye	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	in	motion	,	moving	around	,	looking	at	 eye 	 s 	 	,	 nose 	 s 	 	,	 elbow 	 s 	 	,	looking	at	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
and	where	your	eye	is	n't	looking	,	you	're	 remark 	 ably 	 	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	in	your	vision	.
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 fovea 	 l 	 	part	of	your	eye	,	which	is	the	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	part	,	is	 on 	 ly 	 	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	your	 thumb 	 nail 	 	held	at	 arm 	 s 	 	length	.
that	's	the	detail	part	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	that	way	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	?
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	that	way	,	but	that	's	the	way	it	is	.
you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	in	a	lot	less	information	than	you	think	.
here	's	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	effect	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	by	bellotto	.
it	's	in	the	museum	in	north	carolina	.
bellotto	was	a	student	of	canaletto	's	.
and	i	love	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	like	that	--	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	right	here	.
and	i	love	canalettos	,	 be 	 cause 	 	canaletto	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	detail	,	and	you	can	get	right	up	and	see	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	on	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	hall	in	north	carolina	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	it	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	canaletto	,	and	would	have	all	that	in	detail	.
and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	on	the	bridge	there	,	there	's	a	lot	of	people	--	you	can	just	 bare 	 ly 	 	see	them	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	bridge	.
and	i	thought	 a 	 s 	 	i	got	 close 	 r 	 	i	would	be	able	to	see	all	the	detail	of	most	people	,	see	 the 	 ir 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	and	so	forth	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	got	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 cream 	 ed 	 	.
i	 yell 	 ed 	 	out	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	got	 close 	 r 	 	,	i	found	the	detail	was	n't	there	at	all	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	just	little	 art 	 fully 	 	 place 	 d 	 	 blob 	 s 	 	of	paint	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	picture	,	i	was	 expect 	 ing 	 	detail	that	was	n't	there	.
the	artist	had	 ver 	 y 	 	 clever 	 ly 	 	 suggest 	 ed 	 	people	and	 clothe 	 s 	 	and	 wagon 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	my	brain	had	taken	the	 suggest 	 ion 	 	.
you	're	familiar	with	a	more	 re 	 cent 	 	technology	,	which	is	--	there	,	you	can	get	a	better	view	of	the	 blob 	 s 	 	.
see	,	when	you	get	close	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	just	 blob 	 s 	 	of	paint	.
you	will	have	 s 	 een 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	reverse	effect	.
i	'll	just	give	that	to	you	one	more	time	.
now	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	your	brain	do	when	it	 take 	 s 	 	the	 suggest 	 ion 	 	?
when	an	 art 	 ful 	 	blob	of	paint	or	two	,	by	an	artist	,	 suggest 	 s 	 	a	person	--	say	,	one	of	marvin	minsky	's	little	 socie 	 ty 	 	of	mind	--	do	they	 s 	 end 	 	little	 paint 	 ers 	 	out	to	fill	in	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	in	your	brain	 some 	 where 	 	?
i	do	n't	think	so	.	not	a	chance	.	but	then	,	how	on	earth	is	it	 d 	 one 	 	?
well	,	remember	the	 philosoph 	 er 	 	's	 explan 	 ation 	 	of	the	 lad 	 y 	 	?
it	's	the	same	thing	.
the	brain	just	 make 	 s 	 	you	think	that	it	's	got	the	detail	there	.
you	think	the	detail	's	there	,	but	it	is	n't	there	.
the	brain	is	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	the	detail	in	your	head	at	all	.
it	's	just	making	you	expect	the	detail	.
let	's	just	do	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
is	the	shape	on	the	left	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	shape	on	the	right	,	 rot 	 ated 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	did	it	by	 rot 	 ating 	 	the	one	on	the	left	in	your	mind	's	eye	,	to	see	if	it	 match 	 ed 	 	up	with	the	one	on	the	right	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 rot 	 ated 	 	the	one	on	the	right	?	ok	.
how	do	you	know	that	's	what	you	did	?
there	's	in	fact	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	debate	 rag 	 ing 	 	for	over	20	 year 	 s 	 	in	cognitive	science	--	 vari 	 ous 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	by	roger	shepherd	,	who	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	angular	 velo 	 city 	 	of	 rot 	 ation 	 	of	mental	 image 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	possible	to	do	that	.
but	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	the	process	are	still	in	significant	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	.
and	if	you	read	that	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	come	to	 term 	 s 	 	with	is	even	when	you	're	the	subject	in	the	experiment	,	you	do	n't	know	.
you	do	n't	know	how	you	do	it	.
you	just	know	that	you	have	certain	 belief 	 s 	 	.
and	they	come	in	a	certain	order	,	at	a	certain	time	.
and	what	 explain 	 s 	 	the	fact	that	that	's	what	you	think	?
well	,	that	's	where	you	have	to	go	 back 	 stage 	 	and	ask	the	 magic 	 ian 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	figure	that	i	love	:	bradley	,	petrie	,	and	dumais	.
you	may	think	that	i	've	 cheat 	 ed 	 	,	that	i	've	put	a	little	 white 	 r 	 	-	than	-	white	 bound 	 ary 	 	there	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	see	that	sort	of	 bound 	 ary 	 	,	with	the	necker	cube	 float 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	the	 circle 	 s 	 	?
can	you	see	it	?
well	,	you	know	,	in	effect	,	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	's	 re 	 ally 	 	there	,	in	a	certain	sense	.
your	brain	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	computing	that	 bound 	 ary 	 	,	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	right	there	.
but	now	,	notice	there	are	two	ways	of	 see 	 ing 	 	the	cube	,	right	?
it	's	a	necker	cube	.
 every 	 body 	 	can	see	the	two	ways	of	 see 	 ing 	 	the	cube	?	ok	.
can	you	see	the	four	ways	of	 see 	 ing 	 	the	cube	?
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 see 	 ing 	 	it	.
if	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	cube	 float 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	some	 circle 	 s 	 	,	some	black	 circle 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 see 	 ing 	 	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	cube	,	on	a	black	 back 	 ground 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	through	a	piece	of	swiss	cheese	.
can	you	get	it	?	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	ca	n't	get	it	?	that	'll	help	.
now	you	can	get	it	.	these	are	two	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
when	you	see	the	cube	one	way	,	 be 	 hind 	 	the	screen	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	go	away	.
but	there	's	still	a	sort	of	 fill 	 ing 	 	in	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	tell	if	we	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	any	trouble	 see 	 ing 	 	the	cube	,	but	where	 do 	 es 	 	the	color	change	?
 do 	 es 	 	your	brain	have	to	 s 	 end 	 	little	 paint 	 ers 	 	in	there	?
the	 pur 	 ple 	 	-	 paint 	 ers 	 	and	the	green	-	 paint 	 ers 	 	fight	over	who	's	going	to	paint	that	bit	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 cur 	 tain 	 	?	no	.
your	brain	just	lets	it	go	.	the	brain	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	fill	that	in	.
when	i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	bradley	,	petrie	,	dumais	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	you	just	saw	--	i	'll	go	back	to	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	there	was	no	 fill 	 ing 	 	-	in	 be 	 hind 	 	there	.
and	i	 suppose 	 d 	 	that	that	was	just	a	flat	truth	,	 al 	 ways 	 	true	.
but	rob	van	lier	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 show 	 n 	 	that	it	is	n't	.
now	,	if	you	think	you	see	some	pale	yellow	--	i	'll	run	 th 	 is 	 	a	few	more	 time 	 s 	 	.
look	in	the	gray	 area 	 s 	 	,	and	see	if	you	seem	to	see	 some 	 thing 	 	sort	of	 shadow 	 y 	 	moving	in	there	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	there	.	it	's	no	trick	.
[	``	failure	to	detect	 change 	 s 	 	in	 scene 	 s 	 	``	slide	]	 th 	 is 	 	is	ron	rensink	's	work	,	which	was	in	some	degree	inspired	by	that	 suggest 	 ion 	 	right	at	the	end	of	the	book	.
let	me	just	pause	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	second	if	i	can	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	change	-	 blind 	 ness 	 	.
what	you	're	going	to	see	is	two	 picture 	 s 	 	,	one	of	which	is	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	from	the	other	.
you	see	here	the	red	roof	and	the	gray	roof	,	and	in	between	them	there	will	be	a	mask	,	which	is	just	a	blank	screen	,	for	about	a	quarter	of	a	second	.
so	you	'll	see	the	first	picture	,	then	a	mask	,	then	the	second	picture	,	then	a	mask	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	will	just	 continu 	 e 	 	,	and	your	job	 a 	 s 	 	the	subject	is	to	press	the	button	when	you	see	the	change	.
so	,	show	the	original	picture	for	240	 milli 	 second 	 s 	 	.	blank	.
show	the	next	picture	for	240	 milli 	 second 	 s 	 	.	blank	.
and	keep	going	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	subject	 press 	 es 	 	the	button	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	see	the	change	.	``
so	now	we	're	going	to	be	 subject 	 s 	 	in	the	experiment	.
we	're	going	to	start	easy	.	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
no	trouble	there	.
can	 every 	 body 	 	see	?	all	right	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	rensink	's	 subject 	 s 	 	took	 on 	 ly 	 	a	little	bit	more	than	a	second	to	press	the	button	.
can	you	see	that	one	?
2.9	 second 	 s 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	do	n't	see	it	still	?
what	's	on	the	roof	of	that	barn	?
it	's	easy	.
is	it	a	bridge	or	a	dock	?
there	are	a	few	more	 re 	 ally 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	'll	close	.
i	want	you	to	see	a	few	that	are	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	large	and	yet	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	to	see	.
can	you	see	it	?
audience	:	 y 	 es 	 	.
dan	dennett	:	see	the	 shadow 	 s 	 	going	back	and	forth	?	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	.
so	15.5	 second 	 s 	 	is	the	 med 	 ian 	 	time	for	 subject 	 s 	 	in	his	experiment	there	.
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	one	.	i	'll	end	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	an	obvious	and	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	still	do	n't	see	it	?	how	 man 	 y 	 	still	do	n't	see	it	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	 engine 	 s 	 	on	the	wing	of	that	boeing	?
right	in	the	middle	of	the	picture	!
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	your	attention	.
what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	is	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	using	 the 	 ir 	 	from	-	the	-	 out 	 side 	 	,	third	-	person	 method 	 s 	 	,	can	tell	you	 thing 	 s 	 	about	your	own	 conscious 	 ness 	 	that	you	would	never	dream	of	,	and	that	,	in	fact	,	you	're	not	the	 author 	 ity 	 	on	your	own	 conscious 	 ness 	 	that	you	think	you	are	.
and	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	making	a	lot	of	progress	on	coming	up	with	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	mind	.
jeff	hawkins	,	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	was	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	his	attempt	to	get	 theor 	 y 	 	,	and	a	good	,	big	 theor 	 y 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	 neuro 	 science 	 	.
and	he	's	right	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	.
harvard	medical	school	once	--	i	was	at	a	talk	--	director	of	the	lab	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	in	our	lab	,	we	have	a	 say 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	work	on	one	 neuro 	 n 	 	,	that	's	 neuro 	 science 	 	.
if	you	work	on	two	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	that	's	 psycho 	 logy 	 	.	``
we	have	to	have	more	 theor 	 y 	 	,	and	it	can	come	 a 	 s 	 	much	from	the	top	down	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
