 bas 	 ically 	 	,	there	's	a	major	 demo 	 graphic 	 	event	going	on	.
and	it	may	be	that	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	50	percent	urban	point	is	an	economic	 tip 	 ping 	 	point	.	so	the	world	now	is	a	map	of	 connect 	 ivity 	 	.
it	used	to	be	that	paris	and	london	and	new	york	 we 	 re 	 	the	largest	cities	.
what	we	have	now	is	the	end	of	the	rise	of	the	west	.	that	's	over	.
the	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	 number 	 s 	 	are	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	?	well	,	 village 	 s 	 	of	the	world	are	 empty 	 ing 	 	out	.
the	question	is	,	why	?
and	here	's	the	 un 	 romantic 	 	truth	--	and	the	city	air	 make 	 s 	 	you	free	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	in	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	germany	.	so	some	people	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	like	shanghai	but	most	go	to	the	 squat 	 ter 	 	cities	where	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	rule	.
and	these	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	people	 oppress 	 ed 	 	by	poverty	.
they	're	people	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	poverty	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	they	can	.
they	're	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	 build 	 ers 	 	and	to	a	large	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	.
they	have	home	-	 brew 	 ed 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	 vib 	 rant 	 	urban	life	.
one	-	sixth	of	the	gdp	in	india	is	coming	out	of	mumbai	.
they	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	 up 	 grad 	 ing 	 	,	and	in	a	few	 case 	 s 	 	,	the	government	 help 	 s 	 	.
education	is	the	main	event	that	can	happen	in	cities	.
what	's	going	on	in	the	street	in	mumbai	?
al	gore	 know 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
there	's	no	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	in	 squat 	 ter 	 	cities	.	 every 	 one 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
one	-	sixth	of	 human 	 ity 	 	is	there	.	it	's	soon	going	to	be	more	than	that	.
so	here	's	the	first	punch	line	:	cities	have	 de 	 fused 	 	the	population	bomb	.
and	here	's	the	second	punch	line	.
that	's	the	news	from	 down 	 town 	 	.	here	it	is	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
 star 	 s 	 	have	 shin 	 ed 	 	down	on	earth	's	life	for	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	we	're	 shin 	 ing 	 	right	back	up	.
thank	you	.
