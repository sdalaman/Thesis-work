 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	is	a	good	word	.
even	in	the	 time 	 s 	 	of	h	1n1	,	i	like	the	word	.
laughter	is	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	.	 pass 	 ion 	 	is	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	.
inspiration	is	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	.
we	've	heard	some	 remark 	 able 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	from	some	 remark 	 able 	 	 speaker 	 s 	 	.
but	for	me	,	what	was	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	about	all	of	them	was	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	by	 some 	 thing 	 	i	call	the	``	i	can	``	bug	.
so	,	the	question	is	,	why	 on 	 ly 	 	them	?
in	a	country	of	a	billion	people	and	some	,	why	so	few	?
is	it	luck	?	is	it	chance	?
can	we	all	not	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	and	 conscious 	 ly 	 	get	 infect 	 ed 	 	?
so	,	in	the	next	eight	 minute 	 s 	 	i	would	like	to	share	with	you	my	story	.
i	got	 infect 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	17	,	when	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	student	of	the	design	college	,	i	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	my	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 challeng 	 ed 	 	me	and	had	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 cup 	 s 	 	of	chai	with	me	.
and	i	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	just	how	 wonder 	 ful 	 	it	felt	,	and	how	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	was	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	i	should	have	got	 infect 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	seven	.
so	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 river 	 side 	 	school	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	lab	,	a	lab	to	prototype	and	refine	a	design	process	that	could	 conscious 	 ly 	 	infect	the	mind	with	the	``	i	can	``	bug	.
and	i	 un 	 cover 	 ed 	 	that	if	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	real	-	world	 con 	 text 	 	,	that	if	you	blur	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	between	school	and	life	,	then	children	go	through	a	journey	of	``	aware	,	``	where	they	can	see	the	change	,	``	 en 	 able 	 	,	``	be	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	then	``	empower	,	``	lead	the	change	.
and	that	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	student	 well 	 be 	 ing 	 	.
children	 be 	 came 	 	more	 compete 	 nt 	 	,	and	less	 help 	 less 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	was	all	common	sense	.
so	,	i	'd	like	to	show	you	a	little	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	what	common	practice	 look 	 s 	 	like	at	 river 	 side 	 	.
a	little	 back 	 ground 	 	:	when	my	grade	five	was	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	child	 right 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	made	to	roll	incense	 stick 	 s 	 	,	agarbattis	,	for	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	to	experience	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	a	child	 labor 	 er 	 	.
it	 transform 	 ed 	 	them	.	what	you	will	see	is	 the 	 ir 	 	journey	,	and	then	 the 	 ir 	 	utter	 convict 	 ion 	 	that	they	could	go	out	and	change	the	world	.
that	's	them	 roll 	 ing 	 	.
and	in	two	 hour 	 s 	 	,	after	 the 	 ir 	 	 back 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	broke	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	once	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	out	in	the	city	convincing	 every 	 body 	 	that	child	labor	just	had	to	be	 abolish 	 ed 	 	.
and	look	at	ragav	,	that	moment	when	his	face	 change 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	understand	that	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 shift 	 ed 	 	that	man	's	 mind 	 set 	 	.
and	that	ca	n't	happen	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	.
so	,	when	ragav	 experience 	 d 	 	that	he	went	from	``	teacher	told	me	,	``	to	``	i	am	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.	``	and	that	's	the	``	i	can	``	 mind 	 shift 	 	.
and	it	is	a	process	that	can	be	 energ 	 ized 	 	and	 nurture 	 d 	 	.
but	we	had	 parent 	 s 	 	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	making	our	children	good	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	is	all	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	but	what	about	math	and	science	and	english	?
show	us	the	 grade 	 s 	 	.	``
and	we	did	.	the	data	was	conclusive	.
when	children	are	 empower 	 ed 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	they	do	good	,	they	do	well	,	in	fact	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	national	 bench 	 mark 	 ing 	 	 assess 	 ment 	 	taken	by	over	2,000	 school 	 s 	 	in	india	,	 river 	 side 	 	children	 we 	 re 	 	 out 	 perform 	 ing 	 	the	top	10	 school 	 s 	 	in	india	in	math	,	english	and	science	.
so	,	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.	it	was	now	time	to	take	it	 out 	 side 	 	 river 	 side 	 	.
so	,	on	august	15th	,	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	day	,	2007	,	the	children	of	 river 	 side 	 	set	out	to	infect	ahmedabad	.
now	it	was	not	about	 river 	 side 	 	school	.
it	was	about	all	children	.	so	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 shame 	 less 	 	.
we	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	of	the	municipal	corporation	,	the	police	,	the	press	,	 business 	 es 	 	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	when	are	you	going	to	wake	up	and	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	potential	that	 re 	 side 	 s 	 	in	every	child	?
when	will	you	include	the	child	in	the	city	?
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	open	your	 heart 	 s 	 	and	your	 mind 	 s 	 	to	the	child	.	``
so	,	how	did	the	city	respond	?
since	2007	every	other	month	the	city	 close 	 s 	 	down	the	 bus 	 iest 	 	 street 	 s 	 	for	traffic	and	 convert 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 play 	 ground 	 	for	children	and	 child 	 hood 	 	.
here	was	a	city	 tell 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	child	,	``	you	can	.	``
a	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	 infect 	 ion 	 	in	ahmedabad	.
video	:	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	so	,	the	 bus 	 iest 	 	 street 	 s 	 	closed	down	.
we	have	the	traffic	police	and	municipal	corporation	 help 	 ing 	 	us	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	taken	over	by	children	.
they	are	 s 	 k 	 ating 	 	.	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	street	 play 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 play 	 ing 	 	,	all	free	,	for	all	children	.
atul	karwal	:	aproch	is	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
and	we	plan	to	extend	 th 	 is 	 	to	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	city	.
kiran	bir	sethi	:	and	the	city	will	give	free	time	.
and	ahmedabad	got	the	first	child	-	friendly	zebra	 cross 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	.
geet	sethi	:	when	a	city	 give 	 s 	 	to	the	children	,	in	the	future	the	children	will	give	back	to	the	city	.
kbs	:	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	ahmedabad	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	india	's	first	child	-	friendly	city	.
so	,	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	the	pattern	.	first	200	children	at	 river 	 side 	 	.
then	30,000	children	in	ahmedabad	,	and	growing	.
it	was	time	now	to	infect	india	.
so	,	on	august	15th	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	day	,	2009	,	 empower 	 ed 	 	with	the	same	process	,	we	 empower 	 ed 	 	100,000	children	to	say	,	``	i	can	.	``
how	?	we	designed	a	simple	 tool 	 kit 	 	,	 convert 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	eight	 language 	 s 	 	,	and	 reach 	 ed 	 	32,000	 school 	 s 	 	.
we	 bas 	 ically 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	children	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	take	one	idea	,	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 both 	 ers 	 	you	,	 choos 	 e 	 	one	week	,	and	change	a	billion	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	they	did	.	 st 	 ories 	 	of	change	 pour 	 ed 	 	in	from	all	over	india	,	from	nagaland	in	the	east	,	to	jhunjhunu	in	the	west	,	from	sikkim	in	the	north	,	to	krishnagiri	in	the	south	.
children	 we 	 re 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	for	a	 divers 	 e 	 	range	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
right	from	 lone 	 lines 	 s 	 	to	 fill 	 ing 	 	 pot 	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	street	to	 alcohol 	 ism 	 	,	and	32	children	who	 stop 	 ped 	 	16	child	 marriage 	 s 	 	in	rajasthan	.
i	mean	,	it	was	 in 	 credible 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	 re 	 affirm 	 ing 	 	that	when	 adult 	 s 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	children	and	say	,	``	you	can	,	``	then	they	will	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	in	rajasthan	,	a	 r 	 ural 	 	village	.
child	:	our	 parent 	 s 	 	are	illiterate	and	we	want	to	teach	them	how	to	read	and	write	.
kbs	:	first	time	,	a	 r 	 ally 	 	and	a	street	play	in	a	 r 	 ural 	 	school	--	 un 	 heard 	 	of	--	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	why	 liter 	 acy 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
look	at	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	 say 	 s 	 	.
man	:	 th 	 is 	 	program	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
we	feel	so	nice	that	our	children	can	teach	us	how	to	read	and	write	.
woman	:	i	am	so	happy	that	my	 student 	 s 	 	did	 th 	 is 	 	campaign	.
in	the	future	,	i	will	never	doubt	my	 student 	 s 	 	'	abilities	.
see	?	they	have	 d 	 one 	 	it	.
kbs	:	an	inner	city	school	in	hyderabad	.

we	have	to	start	 collect 	 ing 	 	from	555	.
kbs	:	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 boy 	 s 	 	in	hyderabad	,	going	out	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	difficult	,	but	they	did	it	.
woman	:	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	are	so	young	,	they	have	 d 	 one 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	good	work	.
first	they	have	 clean 	 ed 	 	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	then	it	will	be	hyderabad	,	and	soon	india	.
woman	:	it	was	a	 revel 	 ation 	 	for	me	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	strike	me	that	they	had	so	much	 in 	 side 	 	them	.
girl	:	thank	you	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
for	our	auction	we	have	some	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	for	you	,	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	cause	,	the	money	you	give	us	will	be	used	to	buy	 hear 	 ing 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	.

girl	:	are	you	ready	?	audience	:	 y 	 es 	 	!
girl	:	are	you	ready	?	audience	:	 y 	 es 	 	!
kbs	:	so	,	the	 chart 	 er 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	 start 	 s 	 	right	here	.
street	 play 	 s 	 	,	 auction 	 s 	 	,	 petition 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	changing	 live 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 in 	 credible 	 	.
so	,	how	can	we	still	stay	 immun 	 e 	 	?
how	can	we	stay	 immun 	 e 	 	to	that	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	that	energy	,	that	 excit 	 ement 	 	?
i	know	it	's	obvious	,	but	i	have	to	end	with	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	symbol	of	change	,	gandhiji	.
70	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	it	took	one	man	to	infect	an	entire	nation	with	the	power	of	``	we	can	.	``
so	,	 to 	 day 	 	who	is	it	going	to	take	to	spread	the	 infect 	 ion 	 	from	100,000	children	to	the	200	million	children	in	india	?
last	i	heard	,	the	 pre 	 am 	 ble 	 	still	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	,	the	people	of	india	,	``	right	?
so	,	if	not	us	,	then	who	?
if	not	now	,	then	when	?
like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	is	a	good	word	.
thank	you	.
