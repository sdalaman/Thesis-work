so	i	 re 	 ally 	 	consider	 my 	 self 	 	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.
but	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	in	the	usual	way	,	in	the	sense	that	i	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	tell	my	own	 st 	 ories 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	building	 tool 	 s 	 	that	allow	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	other	people	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	people	all	around	the	world	.
i	do	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	that	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	lot	in	common	.
i	think	people	are	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	think	that	we	have	trouble	 see 	 ing 	 	that	.
you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	look	around	the	world	i	see	a	lot	of	 gap 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	we	all	see	a	lot	of	 gap 	 s 	 	.
and	we	define	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	by	our	 gap 	 s 	 	.
there	's	language	 gap 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	and	racial	 gap 	 s 	 	,	there	's	age	 gap 	 s 	 	,	there	's	gender	 gap 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 sexual 	 ity 	 	 gap 	 s 	 	,	there	's	wealth	and	money	 gap 	 s 	 	,	there	's	education	 gap 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	religious	 gap 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	we	have	all	these	 gap 	 s 	 	and	i	think	we	like	our	 gap 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	make	us	feel	like	we	identify	with	 some 	 thing 	 	,	some	 small 	 er 	 	community	.
but	i	think	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	our	 gap 	 s 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	lot	in	common	.
and	i	think	one	thing	we	have	in	common	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	deep	need	to	express	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	human	 desir 	 e 	 	.	it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	new	.
but	the	thing	about	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	is	that	there	's	 tradition 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 balance 	 	between	the	 desir 	 e 	 	that	we	have	to	express	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	the	number	of	 sym 	 pathetic 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	who	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	stand	around	and	listen	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	new	.
since	the	dawn	of	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	we	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 rect 	 ify 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 balance 	 	by	making	art	,	writing	 poem 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 song 	 s 	 	,	 script 	 ing 	 	 editor 	 ial 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	them	in	to	a	 news 	 paper 	 	,	 gossip 	 ing 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	new	.
what	's	new	is	that	in	the	last	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	physical	human	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	these	 act 	 s 	 	of	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	moving	onto	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	,	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	that	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	.
and	so	what	i	do	is	,	i	write	computer	 program 	 s 	 	that	 stud 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 set 	 s 	 	of	these	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	,	and	then	try	to	draw	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	about	the	people	who	left	them	--	what	they	feel	,	what	they	think	,	what	's	different	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	than	usual	,	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	.
one	project	that	 explore 	 s 	 	these	 idea 	 s 	 	,	which	was	made	about	a	year	ago	,	is	a	piece	 call 	 ed 	 	we	feel	fine	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	piece	that	every	two	or	three	 minute 	 s 	 	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	the	world	's	 new 	 ly 	 	-	 post 	 ed 	 	blog	 ent 	 ries 	 	for	 occur 	 rence 	 s 	 	of	the	 phrase 	 s 	 	``	i	feel	``	or	``	i	am	 feel 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	when	it	 find 	 s 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 phrase 	 s 	 	,	it	 grab 	 s 	 	the	sentence	up	to	the	period	,	and	then	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	tries	to	deduce	the	age	,	gender	and	 geo 	 graphical 	 	location	of	the	person	that	wrote	that	sentence	.
then	,	 know 	 ing 	 	the	 geo 	 graphical 	 	location	and	the	time	,	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	then	figure	out	the	weather	when	that	person	wrote	the	sentence	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	information	is	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	in	a	 data 	 base 	 	that	 collect 	 s 	 	about	20,000	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	a	day	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	running	for	about	a	year	and	a	half	.
it	's	 reach 	 ed 	 	about	seven	-	and	-	a	-	half	million	human	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	now	.
and	i	'll	show	you	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	information	is	then	 visual 	 ized 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	we	feel	fine	.
what	you	see	here	is	a	 mad 	 ly 	 	 s 	 warm 	 ing 	 	mass	of	 particle 	 s 	 	,	each	of	which	 represent 	 s 	 	a	single	human	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	was	 state 	 d 	 	in	the	last	few	 hour 	 s 	 	.
the	color	of	each	particle	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	the	type	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	--	so	that	happy	,	positive	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 bright 	 ly 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	.
and	 s 	 ad 	 	,	negative	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 dark 	 ly 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	.
the	 dia 	 meter 	 	of	each	dot	 represent 	 s 	 	the	length	of	the	sentence	 in 	 side 	 	,	so	that	the	large	 dot 	 s 	 	contain	large	 sentence 	 s 	 	,	and	the	small	 dot 	 s 	 	contain	small	 sentence 	 s 	 	.
any	dot	can	be	 click 	 ed 	 	and	 expand 	 ed 	 	.	and	we	see	here	,	``	i	would	just	feel	so	much	better	if	i	could	curl	up	in	his	 arm 	 s 	 	right	now	and	feel	his	 affect 	 ion 	 	for	me	in	the	embrace	of	his	body	and	the	 tender 	 ness 	 	of	his	lips	.	``
so	it	 get 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	hot	and	 s 	 team 	 y 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	world	of	human	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
and	all	of	these	are	 state 	 d 	 	by	people	:	``	i	know	that	 object 	 ively 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	much	,	but	after	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	small	fish	in	a	big	pond	,	it	's	nice	to	feel	 big 	 ger 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
the	 dot 	 s 	 	exhibit	human	 qual 	 ities 	 	.	they	kind	of	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	physics	,	and	they	 s 	 warm 	 	 wild 	 ly 	 	around	,	kind	of	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	world	of	life	.
and	then	they	 al 	 so 	 	exhibit	curiosity	.
you	can	see	a	few	of	them	are	 s 	 warm 	 ing 	 	around	the	cursor	right	now	.
you	can	see	some	other	 one 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 warm 	 ing 	 	around	the	bottom	left	corner	of	the	screen	around	six	 word 	 s 	 	.	 t 	 hose 	 	six	 word 	 s 	 	represent	the	six	 move 	 ments 	 	of	we	feel	fine	.	we	're	 current 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 mad 	 ness 	 	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	 murmur 	 s 	 	,	montage	,	 mob 	 s 	 	,	 metric 	 s 	 	and	 mound 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'll	walk	you	through	a	few	of	 t 	 hose 	 	now	.
 murmur 	 s 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	all	of	the	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	fly	to	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	,	one	by	one	,	in	reverse	 chrono 	 logical 	 	order	,	they	excuse	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	 scroll 	 ing 	 	list	of	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.

each	of	these	can	be	 click 	 ed 	 	and	we	can	blow	it	up	.
we	see	,	``	i	just	feel	like	i	'm	not	going	to	have	 f 	 un 	 	if	it	's	not	the	both	of	us	.	``	that	was	from	 some 	 one 	 	in	michigan	.

we	can	 al 	 so 	 	get	a	gender	 break 	 down 	 	.

and	then	if	i	go	over	here	,	the	list	 begin 	 s 	 	to	scroll	,	and	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	.
you	can	see	the	little	pink	cursor	moving	 a 	 long 	 	,	 represent 	 ing 	 	our	position	.

there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	search	 cap 	 ability 	 	,	if	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 find 	 ing 	 	out	about	a	certain	population	.

but	i	'll	spare	you	that	.
so	here	are	some	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 montage 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	:	``	i	feel	so	much	of	my	dad	 al 	 ive 	 	in	me	that	there	is	n't	even	room	for	me	.	``

``	i	love	how	i	feel	 to 	 day 	 	.	``
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	we	feel	fine	uses	a	 techni 	 que 	 	that	i	call	``	 pass 	 ive 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	.	``
what	i	mean	by	that	is	that	it	 pass 	 ively 	 	 observ 	 es 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	they	live	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.	it	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	the	world	's	 blog 	 s 	 	and	 look 	 s 	 	at	what	people	are	writing	,	and	these	people	do	n't	know	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	or	 interview 	 ed 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	you	end	up	 get 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	honest	,	candid	,	 since 	 re 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	that	are	often	 ver 	 y 	 	moving	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 techni 	 que 	 	that	i	 usual 	 ly 	 	prefer	in	my	work	 be 	 cause 	 	people	do	n't	know	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 interview 	 ed 	 	.
they	're	just	living	life	,	and	they	end	up	just	 act 	 ing 	 	like	that	.
 an 	 other 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	is	 direct 	 ly 	 	 question 	 ing 	 	people	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 techni 	 que 	 	that	i	 explore 	 d 	 	in	a	different	project	,	the	yahoo	!	time	 cap 	 sule 	 	,	which	was	designed	to	take	a	 finger 	 print 	 	of	the	world	in	2006	.
it	was	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	ten	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 theme 	 s 	 	--	love	,	anger	,	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	and	so	on	--	each	of	which	 contain 	 ed 	 	a	single	,	 ver 	 y 	 	open	-	 end 	 ed 	 	question	put	to	the	world	:	what	do	you	love	?	what	 make 	 s 	 	you	 ang 	 ry 	 	?
what	 make 	 s 	 	you	 s 	 ad 	 	?	what	do	you	 believ 	 e 	 	in	?	and	so	on	.
the	time	 cap 	 sule 	 	was	 avail 	 able 	 	for	one	month	 on 	 line 	 	,	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	10	 language 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
it	's	a	 s 	 pinning 	 	 glob 	 e 	 	,	the	surface	of	which	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	 compose 	 d 	 	of	the	 picture 	 s 	 	and	 word 	 s 	 	and	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	people	that	 submit 	 ted 	 	to	the	time	 cap 	 sule 	 	.
the	ten	 theme 	 s 	 	radiate	out	and	orbit	the	time	 cap 	 sule 	 	.
you	can	sift	through	 th 	 is 	 	data	and	see	what	people	have	 submit 	 ted 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	,	what	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	?	``	 mis 	 s 	 	world	.	``
there	are	two	 mode 	 s 	 	to	the	time	 cap 	 sule 	 	.
there	's	one	world	,	which	 present 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 pinning 	 	 glob 	 e 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	,	which	 split 	 s 	 	the	data	out	 in 	 to 	 	film	 strip 	 s 	 	and	lets	you	sift	through	them	one	by	one	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	project	was	 punctu 	 ated 	 	by	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	event	,	which	was	held	in	the	desert	 out 	 side 	 	albuquerque	in	new	mexico	at	the	jemez	pueblo	,	where	for	three	 con 	 s 	 ecutive 	 	 night 	 s 	 	,	the	 content 	 s 	 	of	the	 cap 	 sule 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	onto	the	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	ancient	red	rock	canyon	 wall 	 s 	 	,	which	stand	about	200	feet	tall	.	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	the	 content 	 s 	 	of	the	time	 cap 	 sule 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bin 	 ary 	 	code	using	a	35	-	watt	laser	 in 	 to 	 	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
you	can	see	the	 o 	 range 	 	line	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	desert	floor	at	about	a	45	degree	angle	there	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	first	night	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	all	 th 	 is 	 	information	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 gap 	 s 	 	that	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	--	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	age	,	gender	and	wealth	and	so	on	.
but	,	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	more	and	more	and	more	,	and	saw	these	 image 	 s 	 	go	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 rock 	 s 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	i	was	 see 	 ing 	 	the	same	 arche 	 ty 	 pal 	 	 event 	 s 	 	 depict 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
you	know	:	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 birth 	 s 	 	,	 funeral 	 s 	 	,	the	first	car	,	the	first	kiss	,	the	first	camel	or	horse	--	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	culture	.
and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	moving	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	picture	here	was	taken	the	final	night	from	a	 di 	 stant 	 	cliff	about	two	 mile 	 s 	 	away	,	where	the	 content 	 s 	 	of	the	 cap 	 sule 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 beam 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
and	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	moving	about	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	human	 express 	 ion 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	shot	off	 in 	 to 	 	the	night	sky	.
and	it	 start 	 ed 	 	to	make	me	think	a	lot	about	the	night	sky	,	and	how	 human 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	used	the	night	sky	to	project	 the 	 ir 	 	great	 st 	 ories 	 	.
you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	in	vermont	,	on	a	farm	where	i	grew	up	,	i	would	often	look	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	dark	sky	and	see	the	three	star	belt	of	orion	,	the	hunter	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	an	adult	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	more	aware	of	the	great	greek	 myth 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	out	in	the	sky	 over 	 head 	 	every	night	.
you	know	,	orion	facing	the	 roar 	 ing 	 	bull	.
perseus	 fly 	 ing 	 	to	the	 rescu 	 e 	 	of	andromeda	.
zeus	 batt 	 ling 	 	chronos	for	control	of	mount	olympus	.
i	mean	,	these	are	the	great	 tale 	 s 	 	of	the	greeks	.
and	it	 caus 	 ed 	 	me	to	wonder	about	our	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	it	 caus 	 ed 	 	me	to	wonder	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	if	we	could	make	new	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ations 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	what	would	 t 	 hose 	 	look	like	?	what	would	 t 	 hose 	 	be	?
if	we	could	make	new	 picture 	 s 	 	in	the	sky	,	what	would	we	draw	?
what	are	the	great	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	?
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	inspired	my	new	project	,	which	is	 debut 	 ing 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	at	ted	.
 no 	 body 	 	's	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	yet	,	 public 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	:	 reveal 	 ing 	 	our	modern	 mytho 	 logy 	 	.
and	it	uses	 th 	 is 	 	metaphor	of	an	 inter 	 active 	 	night	sky	.
so	,	it	's	my	great	pleasure	now	to	show	 th 	 is 	 	to	you	.
so	,	 uni 	 verse 	 	will	open	here	.
and	you	'll	see	that	it	 lead 	 s 	 	with	a	shifting	star	field	,	and	there	's	an	aurora	borealis	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	kind	of	 morph 	 ing 	 	with	color	.	the	color	of	the	aurora	borealis	can	be	controlled	using	 th 	 is 	 	single	bar	of	color	at	the	bottom	,	and	we	'll	put	it	down	here	to	red	.
so	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	--	these	 star 	 s 	 	moving	 a 	 long 	 	.
now	,	these	are	n't	just	little	 point 	 s 	 	of	light	,	little	 pixel 	 s 	 	.
each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 star 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	a	specific	event	in	the	real	world	--	a	quote	that	was	 state 	 d 	 	by	 some 	 body 	 	,	an	image	,	a	news	story	,	a	person	,	a	company	.	you	know	,	some	kind	of	 hero 	 ic 	 	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
and	you	might	notice	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	cursor	 begin 	 s 	 	to	touch	some	of	these	 star 	 s 	 	,	that	 shape 	 s 	 	begin	to	emerge	.
we	see	here	there	's	a	little	man	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	a	woman	.
and	we	see	here	a	photograph	with	a	head	.
you	can	start	to	see	 word 	 s 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	here	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ations 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	i	can	turn	them	all	on	,	and	you	can	see	them	moving	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sky	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	2007	,	the	last	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
the	data	from	 th 	 is 	 	is	global	news	 cover 	 age 	 	from	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	news	 source 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
it	's	using	the	api	of	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	company	that	i	work	with	in	new	york	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	daylife	.
and	it	's	kind	of	the	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	view	at	 th 	 is 	 	level	of	the	world	's	current	 mytho 	 logy 	 	over	the	last	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	.
so	we	can	see	where	it	's	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	here	,	like	 p 	 resident 	 	ford	,	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	bush	.	and	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	isolate	just	the	 word 	 s 	 	--	i	call	them	 secret 	 s 	 	--	and	we	can	cause	them	to	form	an	 alpha 	 bet 	 ical 	 	list	.	and	we	see	anna	nicole	smith	 play 	 ing 	 	a	big	role	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
 p 	 resident 	 	ford	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	gerald	ford	's	funeral	.
we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	click	 any 	 thing 	 	in	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	have	it	 be 	 come 	 	the	center	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	will	enter	 it 	 s 	 	orbit	.
so	,	we	'll	click	ford	,	and	now	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	center	.
and	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 late 	 	to	ford	enter	 it 	 s 	 	orbit	and	swirl	around	it	.
we	can	isolate	just	the	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	and	we	now	see	 t 	 hose 	 	.
we	can	click	on	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	and	have	the	photograph	be	the	center	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
now	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 late 	 	to	it	are	 swirl 	 ing 	 	around	.
we	can	click	on	 th 	 is 	 	and	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	 icon 	 ic 	 	image	of	betty	ford	 kiss 	 ing 	 	her	husband	's	coffin	.
in	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	there	's	kind	of	no	end	.	it	just	 go 	 es 	 	 infinite 	 ly 	 	,	and	you	can	just	kind	of	click	on	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 photograph 	 ic 	 	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 snap 	 shot 	 s 	 	.
but	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	more	specific	in	 defi 	 ning 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	,	if	we	want	to	,	let	's	check	out	what	bill	clinton	's	 uni 	 verse 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
and	let	's	see	,	in	the	past	week	,	what	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	up	to	.
so	now	,	we	have	a	new	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	which	is	just	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	to	all	 thing 	 s 	 	bill	clinton	.
we	can	have	his	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ations 	 	emerge	here	.
we	can	pull	out	his	 secret 	 s 	 	,	and	we	see	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	do	with	 candid 	 ates 	 	,	hillary	,	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	,	barack	obama	.
we	can	see	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	bill	clinton	is	taking	part	in	right	now	.
any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	can	be	 open 	 ed 	 	up	.
so	we	see	obama	and	the	clintons	meet	in	alabama	.
you	can	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	story	;	there	are	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	orbit	.	if	we	open	 th 	 is 	 	up	,	we	get	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
you	can	click	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	to	go	out	and	read	the	article	at	the	source	.	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	from	al	jazeera	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	the	 super 	 star 	 s 	 	.	these	would	be	the	people	that	are	kind	of	the	 loom 	 ing 	 	heroes	and	 hero 	 ine 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	bill	clinton	.	so	there	's	bill	clinton	,	hillary	,	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	george	bush	,	barack	obama	,	 s 	 cooter 	 	libby	--	these	are	kind	of	the	people	of	bill	clinton	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	a	world	map	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	us	the	 geo 	 graphic 	 	reach	of	bill	clinton	in	the	last	week	or	so	.
we	can	see	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	focused	in	america	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	 campaign 	 ing 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	but	a	little	bit	of	action	over	here	in	the	middle	east	.
and	then	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	a	 time 	 line 	 	.
so	we	see	that	he	was	a	bit	quiet	on	saturday	,	but	he	was	back	to	work	on	sunday	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 taper 	 ing 	 	off	since	then	 th 	 is 	 	week	.
and	it	's	not	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	just	people	or	 date 	 s 	 	,	but	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	in	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
so	if	i	put	in	climate	change	for	all	of	2006	,	we	'll	see	what	that	 uni 	 verse 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
here	we	have	our	star	field	.	here	we	have	our	 shape 	 s 	 	.
here	we	have	our	 secret 	 s 	 	.
so	we	see	 aga 	 in 	 	,	climate	change	is	large	:	nairobi	,	global	 con 	 ference 	 	,	 environment 	 al 	 	.
and	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 quote 	 s 	 	that	you	can	see	,	if	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 read 	 ing 	 	about	 quote 	 s 	 	on	climate	change	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	an	infinite	thing	.
the	 super 	 star 	 s 	 	of	climate	change	in	2006	:	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	britain	,	 chin 	 a 	 	.	you	know	,	these	are	the	 tower 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	that	kind	of	define	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	piece	that	 demand 	 s 	 	exploration	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	be	 on 	 line 	 	in	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	next	tuesday	.
and	you	'll	all	be	able	to	use	it	and	kind	of	explore	what	your	own	personal	 mytho 	 logy 	 	might	be	.
you	'll	notice	that	in	daylife	--	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	in	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	it	 support 	 s 	 	both	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	global	 mytho 	 logy 	 	,	which	is	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	broad	 a 	 s 	 	,	say	,	2007	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	a	personal	 mytho 	 logy 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	search	for	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 import 	 ant 	 	to	you	in	your	world	,	and	then	see	what	the	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ations 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	might	look	like	.
