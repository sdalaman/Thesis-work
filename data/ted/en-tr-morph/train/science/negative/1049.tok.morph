i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	here	to	make	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	people	.
i	know	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	made	to	people	.
the	one	i	'm	going	to	make	is	that	it	is	time	for	us	to	 re 	 claim 	 	what	peace	 re 	 ally 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
peace	is	not	``	kumbaya	,	my	lord	.	``
peace	is	not	the	dove	and	the	 rain 	 bow 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	.
when	i	see	the	 symbol 	 s 	 	of	the	 rain 	 bow 	 	and	the	dove	,	i	think	of	personal	 s 	 er 	 en 	 ity 	 	.
i	think	of	 medit 	 ation 	 	.
i	do	not	think	about	what	i	consider	to	be	peace	,	which	is	 sustain 	 able 	 	peace	with	justice	and	 e 	 quality 	 	.
it	is	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	peace	in	which	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	people	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	have	access	to	 en 	 ough 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	to	live	 d 	 ign 	 ified 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	where	these	people	have	 en 	 ough 	 	access	to	education	and	health	care	,	so	that	they	can	live	in	 free 	 dom 	 	from	want	and	 free 	 dom 	 	from	fear	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	human	security	.
and	i	am	not	a	complete	pacifist	like	some	of	my	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	heavy	-	duty	,	non	-	violent	 friend 	 s 	 	,	like	mairead	mcguire	.
i	understand	that	 human 	 s 	 	are	so	``	 mess 	 ed 	 	up	``	--	to	use	a	nice	word	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 promise 	 d 	 	my	mom	i	'd	stop	using	the	f	-	bomb	in	public	.
and	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	and	 hard 	 er 	 	.
mom	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	.
we	need	a	little	bit	of	police	;	we	need	a	little	bit	of	 militar 	 y 	 	,	but	for	defense	.
we	need	to	 re 	 define 	 	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	secure	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
it	is	not	 arm 	 ing 	 	our	country	to	the	 tee 	 th 	 	.
it	is	not	 get 	 ting 	 	other	 count 	 ries 	 	to	arm	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	the	 tee 	 th 	 	with	the	 weapon 	 s 	 	that	we	produce	and	we	sell	them	.
it	is	using	that	money	more	 ration 	 ally 	 	to	make	the	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	world	secure	,	to	make	the	people	of	the	world	secure	.
i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 on 	 going 	 s 	 	in	congress	,	where	the	 p 	 resident 	 	is	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	8.4	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	try	to	get	the	start	vote	.
i	 certain 	 ly 	 	support	the	start	vote	.
but	he	's	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	84	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	the	 modern 	 izing 	 	of	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
do	you	know	the	figure	that	the	u.n.	 talk 	 s 	 	about	for	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	the	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	is	80	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	?
just	that	little	bit	of	money	,	which	to	me	,	i	wish	it	was	in	my	bank	account	--	it	's	not	,	but	...
in	global	 term 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	little	bit	of	money	.
but	it	's	going	to	 modern 	 ize 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	we	do	not	need	and	will	not	be	gotten	rid	of	in	our	 life 	 time 	 	,	 un 	 less 	 	we	get	up	off	our	...
and	take	action	to	make	it	happen	,	 un 	 less 	 	we	begin	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	all	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	in	these	last	two	 day 	 s 	 	are	 element 	 s 	 	of	what	come	together	to	make	human	security	.
it	is	saving	the	 tiger 	 s 	 	.
it	is	 stop 	 ping 	 	the	tar	 sand 	 s 	 	.
it	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	access	to	medical	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	tell	who	 do 	 es 	 	have	cancer	.
it	is	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	is	using	our	money	for	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	is	about	action	.
i	was	in	hiroshima	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	his	holiness	--	we	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	in	front	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	in	the	city	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	about	eight	of	us	 no 	 bel 	 	 laureate 	 s 	 	.
and	he	's	a	bad	guy	.	he	's	like	a	bad	kid	in	church	.
we	're	 star 	 ing 	 	at	 every 	 body 	 	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	our	turn	to	speak	,	and	he	 lean 	 s 	 	over	to	me	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	jody	,	i	'm	a	buddhist	monk	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	your	holiness	.
your	robe	 give 	 s 	 	it	away	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	that	i	kind	of	like	 medit 	 ation 	 	,	and	i	pray	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	good	.	that	's	good	.
we	need	that	in	the	world	.
i	do	n't	follow	that	,	but	that	's	cool	.	``
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	but	i	have	 be 	 come 	 	 skeptic 	 al 	 	.
i	do	not	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 medit 	 ation 	 	and	 pray 	 er 	 	will	change	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
i	think	what	we	need	is	action	.	``
his	holiness	,	in	his	 robe 	 s 	 	,	is	my	new	action	hero	.
i	spoke	with	aung	 s 	 un 	 	suu	kyi	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	ago	.
 a 	 s 	 	most	of	you	know	,	she	's	a	hero	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	her	country	,	burma	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	15	of	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	 imprison 	 ed 	 	for	her	 effort 	 s 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	about	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
she	was	just	released	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	to	see	how	long	she	will	be	free	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	is	 al 	 ready 	 	out	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	in	rangoon	,	 agit 	 ating 	 	for	change	.
she	is	 al 	 ready 	 	out	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	party	to	try	to	 re 	 build 	 	it	.
but	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	her	for	a	range	of	 issue 	 s 	 	.
but	one	thing	that	i	want	to	say	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	similar	to	what	his	holiness	 s 	 aid 	 	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	we	have	a	long	road	to	go	to	 final 	 ly 	 	get	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	my	country	.
but	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	hope	 with 	 out 	 	endeavor	.
i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	hope	of	change	,	 un 	 less 	 	we	take	action	to	make	it	so	.	``
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	woman	hero	of	mine	.
she	's	my	friend	,	dr.	shirin	ebadi	,	the	first	muslim	woman	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	 no 	 bel 	 	peace	prize	.
she	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	 ex 	 ile 	 	for	the	last	year	and	a	half	.
you	ask	her	where	she	 live 	 s 	 	--	where	 do 	 es 	 	she	live	in	 ex 	 ile 	 	?
she	 say 	 s 	 	the	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
she	is	 travel 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	out	of	the	country	at	the	time	of	the	 election 	 s 	 	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	going	home	,	she	 confer 	 red 	 	with	all	the	other	women	that	she	 work 	 s 	 	with	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	,	``	stay	out	.	we	need	you	out	.
we	need	to	be	able	to	talk	to	you	out	there	,	so	that	you	can	give	the	 mess 	 age 	 	of	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.	``
a	year	and	a	half	--	she	's	out	 s 	 peaking 	 	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	the	other	women	in	her	country	.
wangari	maathai	--	2004	peace	laureate	.
they	call	her	the	``	tree	 lad 	 y 	 	,	``	but	she	's	more	than	the	tree	 lad 	 y 	 	.
 work 	 ing 	 	for	peace	is	 ver 	 y 	 	creative	.
it	's	hard	work	every	day	.
when	she	was	 plant 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	think	most	people	understand	that	,	at	the	same	time	,	she	was	using	the	action	of	 get 	 ting 	 	people	together	to	plant	 t 	 hose 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	to	talk	about	how	to	 over 	 come 	 	the	 author 	 itarian 	 	government	in	her	country	.
people	could	not	gather	 with 	 out 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 bust 	 ed 	 	and	taken	to	jail	.
but	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	together	 plant 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	for	the	environment	,	it	was	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	--	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
but	it	's	not	just	 icon 	 ic 	 	women	like	shirin	,	like	aung	 s 	 un 	 	suu	kyi	,	like	wangari	maathai	--	it	is	other	women	in	the	world	who	are	 al 	 so 	 	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	together	to	change	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
the	women	's	league	of	burma	,	11	individual	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	of	burmese	women	came	together	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	strength	in	 number 	 s 	 	.
 work 	 ing 	 	together	is	what	 change 	 s 	 	our	world	.
the	million	 signature 	 s 	 	campaign	of	women	 in 	 side 	 	burma	 work 	 ing 	 	together	to	change	human	 right 	 s 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	to	that	country	.
when	one	is	 arrest 	 ed 	 	and	taken	to	 pri 	 son 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	one	 come 	 s 	 	out	and	 join 	 s 	 	the	 move 	 ment 	 	,	 recogn 	 izing 	 	that	if	they	work	together	,	they	will	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	change	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	country	.
mairead	mcguire	in	the	middle	,	betty	williams	on	the	right	-	hand	side	--	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	peace	to	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	.
i	'll	tell	you	the	quick	story	.
an	ira	driver	was	shot	,	and	his	car	 plow 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	people	on	the	side	of	the	street	.
there	was	a	mother	and	three	children	.
the	children	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	on	the	spot	.
it	was	mairead	's	sister	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	giving	in	to	grief	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	defeat	in	the	face	of	that	violence	,	mairead	 hook 	 ed 	 	up	with	betty	--	a	 s 	 tau 	 nch 	 	protestant	and	a	 s 	 tau 	 nch 	 	catholic	--	and	they	took	to	the	 street 	 s 	 	to	say	,	``	no	more	violence	.	``
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	get	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	,	women	,	some	men	,	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	about	change	.
and	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	part	of	what	 br 	 ought 	 	peace	to	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	,	and	they	're	still	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	still	a	lot	more	to	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	rigoberta	menchu	tum	.
she	 al 	 so 	 	 receiv 	 ed 	 	the	peace	prize	.
she	is	now	running	for	 p 	 resident 	 	.
she	is	 educ 	 ating 	 	the	 indi 	 genous 	 	people	of	her	country	about	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	about	how	you	 br 	 ing 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	to	the	country	,	about	 educ 	 ating 	 	,	about	how	to	vote	--	but	that	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	not	just	about	 vot 	 ing 	 	;	it	's	about	 be 	 ing 	 	an	active	citizen	.
that	's	what	i	got	 s 	 tuck 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	--	the	 land 	 mine 	 	campaign	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	made	 th 	 is 	 	campaign	work	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	grew	from	two	ngos	to	 thousand 	 s 	 	in	90	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	,	 work 	 ing 	 	together	in	common	cause	to	ban	 land 	 mine 	 s 	 	.
some	of	the	people	who	 work 	 ed 	 	in	our	campaign	could	 on 	 ly 	 	work	 may 	 be 	 	an	hour	a	month	.
they	could	 may 	 be 	 	volunteer	that	much	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 other 	 s 	 	,	like	 my 	 self 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	full	-	time	.
but	it	was	the	 action 	 s 	 	,	together	,	of	all	of	us	that	 br 	 ought 	 	about	that	change	.
in	my	view	,	what	we	need	 to 	 day 	 	is	people	 get 	 ting 	 	up	and	taking	action	to	 re 	 claim 	 	the	meaning	of	peace	.
it	's	not	a	 dirt 	 y 	 	word	.
it	's	hard	work	every	single	day	.
and	if	each	of	us	who	 care 	 s 	 	about	the	different	 thing 	 s 	 	we	care	about	got	up	off	our	 butt 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	time	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	,	we	would	change	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	we	would	 s 	 ave 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
and	we	ca	n't	wait	for	the	other	guy	.	we	have	to	do	it	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
thank	you	.
