hi	.	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	 bear 	 s 	 	,	these	are	the	 danc 	 ing 	 	 bear 	 s 	 	.
in	1995	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	two	-	year	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	research	project	to	try	and	find	out	what	was	going	on	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 s 	 lo 	 th 	 	 bear 	 s 	 	in	the	wild	 we 	 re 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 deplete 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	qalandar	community	.	they	are	a	 marginal 	 ized 	 	islamic	community	who	live	 a 	 cross 	 	india	,	and	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	india	since	the	13th	century	.
we	went	about	 get 	 ting 	 	evidence	of	what	was	going	on	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 foot 	 age 	 	from	a	 hid 	 den 	 	camera	in	a	button	.
and	we	went	in	,	 pretend 	 ing 	 	to	be	 buy 	 ers 	 	.
and	we	found	 th 	 is 	 	right	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	state	,	in	karnataka	.
and	the	bear	 cub 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 harvest 	 ed 	 	from	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	and	 trade 	 d 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	for	about	2,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	each	,	and	they	are	used	for	bear	paw	soup	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	trained	,	 lat 	 er 	 	on	,	to	 be 	 come 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	 bear 	 s 	 	like	the	one	you	just	saw	.
 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	the	family	of	qalandars	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	bear	.
the	couple	are	 bare 	 ly 	 	18	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
they	 al 	 ready 	 	have	four	children	 be 	 side 	 	them	.	you	can	see	them	.
and	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	the	family	and	 the 	 ir 	 	livelihood	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	had	to	deal	with	it	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	and	 sustain 	 able 	 	manner	.
now	,	when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 deep 	 er 	 	and	 dig 	 ging 	 	 deep 	 er 	 	,	we	found	that	it	's	an	 il 	 legal 	 	act	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	could	go	to	jail	for	up	to	seven	 year 	 s 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	caught	by	 author 	 ities 	 	.
and	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	to	the	 bear 	 s 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 app 	 all 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	.
the	mother	 bear 	 s 	 	are	 usual 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
the	 cub 	 s 	 	,	which	are	taken	,	are	 separat 	 ed 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 bash 	 ed 	 	out	with	a	metal	rod	.
and	they	use	a	red	hot	iron	needle	to	make	a	hole	through	the	muzzle	.
now	we	had	to	start	changing	these	people	and	 convert 	 ing 	 	them	from	using	that	for	a	livelihood	,	to	 get 	 ting 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	bitu	qalandar	,	who	was	our	first	experiment	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	so	 un 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	would	work	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 s 	 ure 	 	at	all	.	and	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	him	.
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	here	is	some	seed	fund	.
let	's	see	if	you	can	get	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.	``	and	we	got	the	bear	 surrender 	 ed 	 	to	--	we	set	up	a	 sanct 	 uary 	 	.	we	have	four	 sanct 	 u 	 aries 	 	in	india	.
and	now	he	 sell 	 s 	 	cool	 drink 	 s 	 	,	he	's	by	the	 high 	 way 	 	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	booth	.
and	then	it	 start 	 ed 	 	,	there	was	no	 turn 	 ing 	 	back	after	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	sadua	who	came	and	 surrender 	 ed 	 	his	bear	.
and	now	he	 run 	 s 	 	a	cattle	 f 	 odd 	 er 	 	store	and	a	grain	store	near	agra	.
then	there	was	no	looking	back	at	all	for	us	.
we	 g 	 ave 	 	cycle	 rickshaw 	 s 	 	.
we	set	up	carpet	-	weaving	 unit 	 s 	 	,	 voc 	 ation 	 al 	 	training	for	the	women	.
the	women	 we 	 re 	 	just	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	come	out	of	the	community	and	work	with	 main 	 stream 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.	so	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	address	that	.
education	.	the	 kid 	 s 	 	never	went	to	school	.
they	 on 	 ly 	 	had	islamic	education	,	 ver 	 y 	 	little	of	it	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	never	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	go	to	school	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	an	extra	 earn 	 ing 	 	hand	at	home	.	so	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	education	.
so	,	we	sponsor	600	children	education	 program 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	ensure	 bright 	 er 	 	 future 	 s 	 	for	these	people	.
of	course	we	 al 	 so 	 	had	to	get	the	 bear 	 s 	 	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	 bear 	 s 	 	when	they	come	in	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	.
we	have	a	 veterin 	 ary 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	in	our	 rescu 	 e 	 	 center 	 s 	 	.
