i	'm	going	around	the	world	giving	 talk 	 s 	 	about	darwin	,	and	 usual 	 ly 	 	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	darwin	's	strange	 in 	 version 	 	of	 reason 	 ing 	 	.
now	that	title	,	that	phrase	,	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	critic	,	an	early	critic	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pass 	 age 	 	that	i	just	love	,	and	would	like	to	read	for	you	.
``	in	the	 theor 	 y 	 	with	which	we	have	to	deal	,	absolute	 ignor 	 ance 	 	is	the	 artifice 	 r 	 	;	so	that	we	may	 e 	 nunci 	 ate 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	fundamental	principle	of	the	whole	system	,	that	,	in	order	to	make	a	perfect	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	machine	,	it	is	not	requisite	to	know	how	to	make	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	will	be	found	on	 care 	 ful 	 	examination	to	express	,	in	 condens 	 ed 	 	form	,	the	essential	 pur 	 port 	 	of	the	 theor 	 y 	 	,	and	to	express	in	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	all	mr.	darwin	's	meaning	;	who	,	by	a	strange	 in 	 version 	 	of	 reason 	 ing 	 	,	 seem 	 s 	 	to	think	absolute	 ignor 	 ance 	 	fully	 qual 	 ified 	 	to	take	the	place	of	absolute	 wis 	 dom 	 	in	the	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	of	creative	skill	.	``
 exact 	 ly 	 	.	 exact 	 ly 	 	.	and	it	is	a	strange	 in 	 version 	 	.
a	 creation 	 ist 	 	pamphlet	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	page	in	it	:	``	test	two	:	do	you	know	of	any	building	that	did	n't	have	a	 build 	 er 	 	?	 y 	 es 	 	/	no	.
do	you	know	of	any	 paint 	 ing 	 	that	did	n't	have	a	 paint 	 er 	 	?	 y 	 es 	 	/	no	.
do	you	know	of	any	car	that	did	n't	have	a	maker	?	 y 	 es 	 	/	no	.
if	you	 answer 	 ed 	 	'	 y 	 es 	 	'	for	any	of	the	above	,	give	 detail 	 s 	 	.	``
a	-	ha	!	i	mean	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	strange	 in 	 version 	 	of	 reason 	 ing 	 	.
you	would	have	thought	it	 stand 	 s 	 	to	reason	that	design	 requir 	 es 	 	an	intelligent	 design 	 er 	 	.
but	darwin	 show 	 s 	 	that	it	's	just	false	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	darwin	's	other	strange	 in 	 version 	 	,	which	is	 equal 	 ly 	 	 puzzl 	 ing 	 	at	first	,	but	in	some	ways	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	 stand 	 s 	 	to	reason	that	we	love	chocolate	cake	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	sweet	.
 guy 	 s 	 	go	for	 girl 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	sexy	.
we	 ador 	 e 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	so	cute	.
and	,	of	course	,	we	are	 amuse 	 d 	 	by	 joke 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	funny	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.	it	is	.	and	darwin	 show 	 s 	 	us	why	.
let	's	start	with	sweet	.	our	sweet	tooth	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	 evolv 	 ed 	 	sugar	 detect 	 or 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	sugar	is	high	energy	,	and	it	's	just	 be 	 en 	 	wired	up	to	the	 prefer 	 er 	 	,	to	put	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 crud 	 e 	 ly 	 	,	and	that	's	why	we	like	sugar	.
honey	is	sweet	 be 	 cause 	 	we	like	it	,	not	``	we	like	it	 be 	 cause 	 	honey	is	sweet	.	``
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	sweet	about	honey	.
if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	at	glucose	 molecule 	 s 	 	till	you	 we 	 re 	 	blind	,	you	would	n't	see	why	they	 taste 	 d 	 	sweet	.
you	have	to	look	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	to	understand	why	they	're	sweet	.
so	if	you	think	first	there	was	 sweet 	 ness 	 	,	and	then	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	like	 sweet 	 ness 	 	,	you	've	got	it	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	;	that	's	just	wrong	.	it	's	the	other	way	round	.
 sweet 	 ness 	 	was	born	with	the	wiring	which	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
and	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	sexy	about	these	young	 lad 	 ies 	 	.
and	it	's	a	good	thing	that	there	is	n't	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	there	 we 	 re 	 	,	then	mother	nature	would	have	a	problem	:	how	on	earth	do	you	get	 chimp 	 s 	 	to	mate	?
now	you	might	think	,	ah	,	there	's	a	solution	:	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
that	would	be	one	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	but	there	's	a	 quick 	 er 	 	way	.
just	wire	the	 chimp 	 s 	 	up	to	love	that	look	,	and	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	they	do	.
that	's	all	there	is	to	it	.
over	six	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	and	the	 chimp 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	our	different	ways	.
we	 be 	 came 	 	bald	-	bodied	,	 odd 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	;	for	one	reason	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	they	did	n't	.
if	we	had	n't	,	then	 prob 	 ably 	 	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	the	height	of	 s 	 ex 	 iness 	 	.
our	sweet	tooth	is	an	 evolv 	 ed 	 	and	 instinct 	 ual 	 	 pre 	 ference 	 	for	high	-	energy	food	.
it	was	n't	designed	for	chocolate	cake	.
chocolate	cake	is	a	 super 	 normal 	 	 stimul 	 us 	 	.
the	term	is	 ow 	 ed 	 	to	niko	tinbergen	,	who	did	his	famous	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	 gull 	 s 	 	,	where	he	found	that	that	 o 	 range 	 	spot	on	the	gull	's	beak	--	if	he	made	a	 big 	 ger 	 	,	 or 	 anger 	 	spot	the	gull	 chick 	 s 	 	would	peck	at	it	even	 hard 	 er 	 	.
it	was	a	 hyper 	 stimul 	 us 	 	for	them	,	and	they	 love 	 d 	 	it	.
what	we	see	with	,	say	,	chocolate	cake	is	it	's	a	 super 	 normal 	 	 stimul 	 us 	 	to	tweak	our	design	wiring	.
and	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 super 	 normal 	 	 stimul 	 i 	 	;	chocolate	cake	is	one	.
there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 super 	 normal 	 	 stimul 	 i 	 	for	 s 	 ex 	 iness 	 	.
and	there	's	even	 super 	 normal 	 	 stimul 	 i 	 	for	 cute 	 ness 	 	.	here	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	love	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	and	that	we	not	be	put	off	by	,	say	,	 mess 	 y 	 	 dia 	 per 	 s 	 	.
so	 bab 	 ies 	 	have	to	attract	our	 affect 	 ion 	 	and	our	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	do	.
and	,	by	the	way	,	a	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	 mother 	 s 	 	prefer	the	smell	of	the	 dirt 	 y 	 	 dia 	 per 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	baby	.
so	nature	 work 	 s 	 	on	 man 	 y 	 	 level 	 s 	 	here	.
but	now	,	if	 bab 	 ies 	 	did	n't	look	the	way	they	do	--	if	 bab 	 ies 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	's	what	we	would	find	 ador 	 able 	 	,	that	's	what	we	would	find	--	we	would	think	,	oh	my	 good 	 ness 	 	,	do	i	ever	want	to	hug	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	strange	 in 	 version 	 	.
well	now	,	 final 	 ly 	 	what	about	funny	.	my	answer	is	,	it	's	the	same	story	,	the	same	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	hard	one	,	the	one	that	is	n't	obvious	.	that	's	why	i	 leav 	 e 	 	it	to	the	end	.
and	i	wo	n't	be	able	to	say	too	much	about	it	.
but	you	have	to	think	 evolution 	 arily 	 	,	you	have	to	think	,	what	hard	job	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	--	it	's	 dirt 	 y 	 	work	,	 some 	 body 	 	's	got	to	do	it	--	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	to	give	us	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	,	 in 	 built 	 	reward	for	it	when	we	succeed	.
now	,	i	think	we	've	found	the	answer	--	i	and	a	few	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	neural	system	that	's	wired	up	to	reward	the	brain	for	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 grub 	 by 	 	 cleric 	 al 	 	job	.
our	 bump 	 er 	 	 stick 	 er 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	view	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	joy	of	 de 	 bug 	 ging 	 	.
now	i	'm	not	going	to	have	time	to	spell	it	all	out	,	but	i	'll	just	say	that	 on 	 ly 	 	some	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 de 	 bug 	 ging 	 	get	the	reward	.
and	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	we	're	using	humor	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	 neuro 	 scientific 	 	 prob 	 e 	 	by	 s 	 witch 	 ing 	 	humor	on	and	off	,	by	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	knob	on	a	joke	--	now	it	's	not	funny	...	oh	,	now	it	's	 funni 	 er 	 	...
now	we	'll	turn	a	little	bit	more	...	now	it	's	not	funny	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	the	brain	,	the	functional	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	the	brain	.
matthew	hurley	is	the	first	author	of	 th 	 is 	 	.	we	call	it	the	hurley	model	.
he	's	a	computer	scientist	,	reginald	adams	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	,	and	there	i	am	,	and	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	together	 in 	 to 	 	a	book	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
