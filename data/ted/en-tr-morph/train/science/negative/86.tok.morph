on	september	10	,	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	of	my	 seven 	 th 	 	 birth 	 day 	 	,	i	came	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	to	the	kitchen	,	where	my	mother	was	 wash 	 ing 	 	the	 dish 	 es 	 	and	my	father	was	 read 	 ing 	 	the	paper	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	i	sort	of	 present 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	them	in	the	 door 	 way 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	happy	 birth 	 day 	 	!	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	seven	.	``
and	my	father	 smil 	 ed 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	you	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	i	'm	going	to	have	a	party	and	a	cake	and	get	a	lot	of	 present 	 s 	 	?	``	and	my	dad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
but	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	seven	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	age	of	reason	,	and	you	're	now	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 commit 	 ting 	 	any	and	all	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	against	god	and	man	.	``
now	,	i	had	heard	 th 	 is 	 	phrase	,	``	age	of	reason	,	``	before	.
sister	mary	kevin	had	 be 	 en 	 	 band 	 y 	 ing 	 	it	about	my	second	-	grade	class	at	school	.	but	when	she	 s 	 aid 	 	it	,	the	phrase	 seem 	 ed 	 	all	caught	up	in	the	 excit 	 ement 	 	of	 pre 	 par 	 ations 	 	for	our	first	 commun 	 ion 	 	and	our	first	 confess 	 ion 	 	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	all	about	the	white	dress	and	the	white	veil	,	and	 any 	 way 	 	,	i	had	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	paid	all	that	much	attention	to	that	phrase	,	``	age	of	reason	.	``
so	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	age	of	reason	.	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	 aga 	 in 	 	?	``
and	my	dad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	catholic	church	that	god	 know 	 s 	 	that	little	 kid 	 s 	 	do	n't	know	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	right	and	wrong	,	but	when	you	're	seven	,	you	're	old	 en 	 ough 	 	to	know	better	.

and	my	mom	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	it	.	``

all	that	 be 	 ing 	 	good	and	no	real	credit	for	it	.
and	,	worst	of	all	,	how	could	i	not	have	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	information	 un 	 til 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	day	that	it	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	 use 	 less 	 	to	me	?	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	mom	and	dad	,	what	about	santa	claus	?
i	mean	,	santa	claus	 know 	 s 	 	if	you	're	 naught 	 y 	 	or	nice	,	right	?	``
and	my	dad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	,	honey	,	i	think	that	's	 technical 	 ly 	 	just	between	 thank 	 s 	 giving 	 	and	christmas	.	``
and	my	mother	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	bob	,	stop	it	.	let	's	just	tell	her	.
i	mean	,	she	's	seven	.	julie	,	there	is	no	santa	claus	.	``
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	that	 up 	 setting 	 	to	me	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	whole	elaborate	story	about	santa	claus	:	how	they	had	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	santa	claus	 him 	 self 	 	and	 agree 	 d 	 	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	santa	 deliver 	 ing 	 	our	 present 	 s 	 	over	the	night	of	christmas	eve	,	like	he	did	for	every	other	family	who	got	to	open	 the 	 ir 	 	 surprise 	 s 	 	first	thing	christmas	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	our	family	would	give	santa	more	time	.
santa	would	come	to	our	house	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	nine	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	high	mass	on	christmas	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	if	all	of	us	 kid 	 s 	 	did	not	make	a	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 	.
which	made	me	 ver 	 y 	 	suspicious	.
it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	obvious	that	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	our	 parent 	 s 	 	giving	us	the	 present 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	my	dad	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 wrap 	 ping 	 	style	,	and	my	mother	's	 hand 	 writing 	 	was	so	close	to	santa	's	.
plus	,	why	would	santa	 s 	 ave 	 	time	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	loop	back	to	our	house	after	he	'd	gone	to	 every 	 body 	 	else	's	?
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	obvious	 con 	 clusion 	 	to	reach	from	 th 	 is 	 	mountain	of	evidence	:	our	family	was	too	strange	and	weird	for	even	santa	claus	to	come	visit	,	and	my	poor	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	protect	us	from	the	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 humil 	 iation 	 	of	 reject 	 ion 	 	by	santa	,	who	was	 jol 	 ly 	 	--	but	,	let	's	face	it	,	he	was	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 judgment 	 al 	 	.
so	,	to	find	out	that	there	was	no	santa	claus	at	all	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	sort	of	a	relief	.
i	left	the	kitchen	not	 re 	 ally 	 	in	shock	about	santa	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	i	was	just	 dumb 	 found 	 ed 	 	about	how	i	could	have	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	age	of	reason	thing	.
it	was	too	late	for	me	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	i	could	help	 some 	 one 	 	else	,	 some 	 one 	 	who	could	use	the	information	.
they	had	to	fit	two	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	:	they	had	to	be	old	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	able	to	understand	the	whole	 con 	 cept 	 	of	the	age	of	reason	,	and	not	yet	seven	.
the	answer	was	clear	:	my	brother	bill	.	he	was	six	.
well	,	i	 final 	 ly 	 	found	bill	about	a	block	away	from	our	house	at	 th 	 is 	 	public	school	 play 	 ground 	 	.	it	was	a	saturday	,	and	he	was	all	by	 him 	 self 	 	,	just	 kick 	 ing 	 	a	ball	against	the	side	of	a	wall	.
i	ran	up	to	him	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	bill	!
i	just	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	age	of	reason	 start 	 s 	 	when	you	turn	seven	,	and	then	you	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 commit 	 ting 	 	any	and	all	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	against	god	and	man	.	``	and	bill	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	?	``	and	then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	,	you	're	six	.	you	have	a	whole	year	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	to	and	god	wo	n't	notice	it	.	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	?	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	?	so	 every 	 thing 	 	!	``	and	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	run	.	i	was	so	 ang 	 ry 	 	with	him	.
but	when	i	got	to	the	top	of	the	 step 	 s 	 	,	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	 dramat 	 ically 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	by	the	way	,	bill	,	there	is	no	santa	claus	.	``
now	,	i	did	n't	know	it	at	the	time	,	but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	 turn 	 ing 	 	seven	on	september	10	.
for	my	13th	 birth 	 day 	 	,	i	 plan 	 ned 	 	a	 s 	 lumber 	 	party	with	all	of	my	 girlfriend 	 s 	 	,	but	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	 before 	 hand 	 	my	mother	took	me	 a 	 side 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	need	to	speak	to	you	 private 	 ly 	 	.
september	10	is	not	your	 birth 	 day 	 	.	it	's	october	10.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	listen	.	the	cut	-	off	date	to	start	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	was	september	15.	``
``	so	,	i	told	them	that	your	 birth 	 day 	 	was	on	september	10	,	and	then	i	was	n't	 s 	 ure 	 	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	just	going	to	go	 b 	 lab 	 	it	all	over	the	place	,	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	tell	you	your	 birth 	 day 	 	was	september	10	.
but	,	julie	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	so	ready	to	start	school	,	honey	.	you	 we 	 re 	 	so	ready	.	``
i	thought	about	it	,	and	when	i	was	four	,	i	was	 al 	 ready 	 	the	 old 	 est 	 	of	four	children	,	and	my	mother	even	had	 an 	 other 	 	child	to	come	,	so	what	i	think	she	 understand 	 ably 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	was	that	she	was	so	ready	,	she	was	so	ready	.	then	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	worry	,	julie	,	every	year	on	october	10	when	it	was	your	 birth 	 day 	 	but	you	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	it	,	i	made	 s 	 ure 	 	that	you	ate	a	piece	of	cake	that	day	.	``
which	was	 comfort 	 ing 	 	,	but	 trou 	 bling 	 	.
my	mother	had	 be 	 en 	 	 celebr 	 ating 	 	my	 birth 	 day 	 	with	me	,	 with 	 out 	 	me	.
what	was	so	 up 	 setting 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	new	piece	of	information	was	not	that	i	was	going	to	have	to	change	the	date	of	my	 s 	 lumber 	 	party	with	all	of	my	 girlfriend 	 s 	 	,	what	was	most	 up 	 setting 	 	was	that	 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	that	i	was	not	a	virgo	.
i	had	a	huge	virgo	 post 	 er 	 	in	my	 bed 	 room 	 	,	and	i	read	my	 hor 	 o 	 scope 	 	every	single	day	,	and	it	was	so	 total 	 ly 	 	me	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	that	i	was	a	libra	?
so	,	i	took	the	bus	 down 	 town 	 	to	get	the	new	libra	 post 	 er 	 	.
the	virgo	 post 	 er 	 	is	a	picture	of	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	woman	with	long	hair	,	sort	of	 loung 	 ing 	 	by	some	water	,	but	the	libra	 post 	 er 	 	is	just	a	huge	scale	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	around	the	time	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 fill 	 ing 	 	out	 physical 	 ly 	 	,	and	i	was	 fill 	 ing 	 	out	a	lot	more	than	a	lot	of	the	other	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	the	whole	idea	that	my	 astro 	 logical 	 	sign	was	a	scale	just	 seem 	 ed 	 	ominous	and	 depress 	 ing 	 	.
but	i	got	the	new	libra	 post 	 er 	 	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	read	my	new	libra	 hor 	 o 	 scope 	 	,	and	i	was	 astonish 	 ed 	 	to	find	that	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	me	.
it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	looking	back	on	 th 	 is 	 	whole	age	-	of	-	reason	/	change	-	of	-	 birth 	 day 	 	thing	,	that	it	 dawn 	 ed 	 	on	me	:	i	was	n't	 turn 	 ing 	 	seven	when	i	thought	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	seven	.	i	had	a	whole	other	month	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	before	god	 start 	 ed 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	 tab 	 s 	 	on	me	.
oh	,	life	can	be	so	cruel	.
one	day	,	two	mormon	 mission 	 aries 	 	came	to	my	door	.
now	,	i	just	live	off	a	main	 thorough 	 fare 	 	in	los	angeles	,	and	my	block	is	--	well	,	it	's	a	natural	 begin 	 ning 	 	for	people	who	are	 peddl 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	door	to	door	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	get	little	old	 lad 	 ies 	 	from	the	 seven 	 th 	 	day	adventist	church	 show 	 ing 	 	me	these	cartoon	 picture 	 s 	 	of	heaven	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	get	 teenager 	 s 	 	who	promise	me	that	they	wo	n't	join	a	gang	and	just	start	 rob 	 bing 	 	people	if	i	 on 	 ly 	 	buy	some	magazine	 subscription 	 s 	 	from	them	.
so	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	i	just	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	 door 	 bell 	 	,	but	on	 th 	 is 	 	day	i	 answer 	 ed 	 	.
and	there	stood	two	 boy 	 s 	 	,	each	about	19	,	in	white	 starch 	 ed 	 	short	-	sleeved	 shirt 	 s 	 	,	and	they	had	little	name	 tag 	 s 	 	that	identified	them	 a 	 s 	 	official	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	of	the	church	of	jesus	christ	of	 lat 	 ter 	 	-	day	 saint 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	had	a	 mess 	 age 	 	for	me	from	god	.

now	,	i	was	raised	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	 north 	 west 	 	,	around	a	lot	of	church	of	 lat 	 ter 	 	-	day	 saint 	 s 	 	people	and	,	you	know	,	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	with	them	and	even	 d 	 ated 	 	them	,	but	i	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 k 	 new 	 	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	or	what	they	 s 	 aid 	 	to	people	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	out	on	a	mission	,	and	i	guess	i	was	,	sort	of	,	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	come	in	.	``	and	they	 look 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	them	all	that	often	.

well	,	then	they	did	n't	look	so	fresh	-	 face 	 d 	 	and	cute	to	me	any	more	,	but	they	had	more	to	say	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	if	you	're	a	mormon	and	if	you	're	in	good	 stand 	 ing 	 	with	the	church	,	when	you	die	you	get	to	go	to	heaven	and	be	with	your	family	for	all	 et 	 ern 	 ity 	 	.	``

i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	--	now	,	i	do	n't	have	a	uterus	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	cancer	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	so	,	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	that	if	i	went	to	heaven	i	would	get	my	old	uterus	back	?	``	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 s 	 ure 	 	.	``

what	if	you	had	a	nose	job	and	you	 like 	 d 	 	it	?
would	god	force	you	to	get	your	old	nose	back	?
well	,	then	they	 g 	 ave 	 	me	 th 	 is 	 	book	of	mormon	,	and	they	told	me	to	read	 th 	 is 	 	chapter	and	that	chapter	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	'd	come	back	some	day	and	check	in	on	me	,	and	i	think	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	 hur 	 ry 	 	,	``	or	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	just	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	,	``	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	gone	.
ok	,	so	,	i	 initi 	 ally 	 	felt	 re 	 ally 	 	 super 	 ior 	 	to	these	 boy 	 s 	 	,	and	 s 	 mug 	 	in	my	more	 convention 	 al 	 	faith	.	but	then	,	the	more	i	thought	about	it	,	the	more	i	had	to	be	honest	with	 my 	 self 	 	.
if	 some 	 one 	 	came	to	my	door	and	i	was	 hear 	 ing 	 	catholic	 the 	 ology 	 	and	dogma	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	god	 impregnate 	 d 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	young	girl	 with 	 out 	 	the	use	of	 inter 	 course 	 	,	and	the	fact	that	she	was	a	virgin	is	 maniac 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	--	--	and	she	had	a	baby	,	and	that	's	the	son	of	god	,	``	i	mean	,	i	would	think	that	's	 equal 	 ly 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
i	'm	just	so	used	to	that	story	.
so	,	i	could	n't	let	 my 	 self 	 	feel	 con 	 descend 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	these	 boy 	 s 	 	.
but	the	question	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	when	they	first	 arriv 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	my	head	:	did	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	god	 love 	 d 	 	me	with	all	his	heart	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	how	i	felt	about	that	question	.
now	,	if	they	'd	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	do	you	feel	that	god	 love 	 s 	 	you	with	all	his	heart	?
well	,	that	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	much	different	,	i	think	i	would	have	 instant 	 ly 	 	 answer 	 ed 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	feel	it	all	the	time	.	i	feel	god	's	love	when	i	'm	hurt	and	 con 	 fused 	 	,	and	i	feel	 consol 	 ed 	 	and	 car 	 ed 	 	for	.	i	take	shelter	in	god	's	love	when	i	do	n't	understand	why	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	,	and	i	feel	god	's	love	when	i	look	with	 grat 	 itude 	 	at	all	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	i	see	.	``
but	since	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	that	question	with	the	word	 believ 	 e 	 	in	it	,	 some 	 how 	 	it	was	all	different	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	if	i	 believ 	 ed 	 	what	i	so	 clear 	 ly 	 	felt	.
