of	the	five	 sense 	 s 	 	,	vision	is	the	one	that	i	appreciate	the	most	,	and	it	's	the	one	that	i	can	 l 	 east 	 	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 partial 	 ly 	 	due	to	my	father	,	who	was	blind	.
it	was	a	fact	that	he	did	n't	make	much	of	a	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 	about	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	.
one	time	in	nova	scotia	,	when	we	went	to	see	a	total	eclipse	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	same	one	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	carly	simon	song	,	which	may	or	may	not	refer	to	james	taylor	,	warren	beatty	or	mick	jagger	;	we	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
they	 hand 	 ed 	 	out	these	dark	plastic	 view 	 ers 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	look	 direct 	 ly 	 	at	the	 s 	 un 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 dam 	 aging 	 	our	 eye 	 s 	 	.
but	dad	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	:	he	did	n't	want	us	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	us	 in 	 stead 	 	to	use	these	cheap	 card 	 board 	 	 view 	 ers 	 	so	that	there	was	no	chance	at	all	that	our	 eye 	 s 	 	would	be	 damage 	 d 	 	.
i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	little	strange	at	the	time	.
what	i	did	n't	know	at	the	time	was	that	my	father	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	born	with	perfect	 eye 	 sight 	 	.
when	he	and	his	sister	martha	 we 	 re 	 	just	 ver 	 y 	 	little	,	 the 	 ir 	 	mom	took	them	out	to	see	a	total	eclipse	--	or	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	a	solar	eclipse	--	and	not	long	after	that	,	both	of	them	 start 	 ed 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 sight 	 	.
 decade 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	the	source	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 blind 	 ness 	 	was	most	 like 	 ly 	 	some	sort	of	bacterial	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	near	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	tell	,	it	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	to	do	with	that	solar	eclipse	,	but	by	then	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	had	 al 	 ready 	 	gone	to	her	grave	 think 	 ing 	 	it	was	her	fault	.
so	,	dad	 graduate 	 d 	 	harvard	in	1946	,	married	my	mom	,	and	 b 	 ought 	 	a	house	in	lexington	,	massachusetts	,	where	the	first	 shot 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 fire 	 d 	 	against	the	british	in	1775	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	hit	any	of	them	 un 	 til 	 	concord	.
he	got	a	job	 work 	 ing 	 	for	raytheon	,	 design 	 ing 	 	 gui 	 dance 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	which	was	part	of	the	route	128	high	-	tech	axis	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	--	so	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	 silicon 	 e 	 	 val 	 ley 	 	in	the	'70s	.
dad	was	n't	a	real	 militar 	 istic 	 	kind	of	guy	;	he	just	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	bad	that	he	was	n't	able	to	fight	in	world	war	ii	on	account	of	his	handicap	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	did	let	him	get	through	the	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	-	hour	-	long	 arm 	 y 	 	physical	 ex 	 am 	 	before	they	got	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	test	,	which	was	for	vision	.
so	,	dad	 start 	 ed 	 	 rack 	 ing 	 	up	all	of	these	 patent 	 s 	 	and	 gain 	 ing 	 	a	reputation	 a 	 s 	 	a	blind	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	rocket	scientist	,	inventor	.
but	to	us	he	was	just	dad	,	and	our	home	life	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	normal	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	,	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	had	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 nerd 	 y 	 	 hob 	 bie 	 s 	 	like	 mineral 	 ogy 	 	and	 micro 	 biology 	 	and	the	space	program	and	a	little	bit	of	 politic 	 s 	 	.
i	 play 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 ches 	 s 	 	.
but	at	the	age	of	14	,	a	friend	of	mine	got	me	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 com 	 ic 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	was	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	for	a	living	.
so	,	here	's	my	dad	:	he	's	a	scientist	,	he	's	an	engineer	and	he	's	a	 militar 	 y 	 	 contract 	 or 	 	.
so	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	four	 kid 	 s 	 	,	right	?
one	 grow 	 s 	 	up	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	computer	scientist	,	one	 grow 	 s 	 	up	to	join	the	 nav 	 y 	 	,	one	 grow 	 s 	 	up	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	engineer	,	and	then	there	's	me	:	the	 com 	 ic 	 	book	artist	.
which	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	 make 	 s 	 	me	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	dean	kamen	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	a	 com 	 ic 	 	book	artist	,	son	of	an	inventor	,	and	he	's	an	inventor	,	son	of	a	 com 	 ic 	 	book	artist	.
right	,	it	's	true	.
the	funny	thing	is	,	dad	had	a	lot	of	faith	in	me	.
he	had	faith	in	my	abilities	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	he	had	no	direct	evidence	that	i	was	any	good	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	:	 every 	 thing 	 	he	saw	was	just	a	blur	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	a	real	meaning	to	the	term	``	blind	faith	,	``	which	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	the	same	negative	 con 	 not 	 ation 	 	for	me	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	for	other	people	.
now	,	faith	in	 thing 	 s 	 	which	can	not	be	 s 	 een 	 	,	which	can	not	be	 prov 	 ed 	 	,	is	not	the	sort	of	faith	that	i	've	ever	 re 	 ally 	 	related	to	all	that	much	.
i	tend	to	like	science	,	where	what	we	see	and	can	 a 	 s 	 certain 	 	are	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	what	we	know	.
but	there	's	a	middle	ground	,	too	.
a	middle	ground	tread	by	people	like	poor	old	charles	babbage	,	and	his	 s 	 team 	 	-	driven	 computer 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	never	built	.
 no 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	what	it	was	that	he	had	in	mind	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	ada	lovelace	,	and	he	went	to	his	grave	 try 	 ing 	 	to	pursue	that	dream	.
vannevar	bush	with	his	 meme 	 x 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	all	of	human	knowledge	at	your	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	--	he	had	 th 	 is 	 	vision	.
and	i	think	a	lot	of	people	in	his	day	 prob 	 ably 	 	thought	he	was	a	bit	of	a	kook	.
and	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	can	look	back	in	retrospect	and	say	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	ha	-	ha	,	you	know	--	it	's	all	 micro 	 film 	 	.	but	that	's	--	that	's	not	the	point	.	he	 under 	 stood 	 	the	shape	of	the	future	.
so	did	j.c.r	.	licklider	and	his	 not 	 ions 	 	for	computer	-	human	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
same	thing	:	he	 under 	 stood 	 	the	shape	of	the	future	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 implement 	 ed 	 	by	people	much	 lat 	 er 	 	.
or	paul	baran	,	and	his	vision	for	 pack 	 et 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ing 	 	.
 hard 	 ly 	 	 any 	 body 	 	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	him	in	his	day	.
or	even	the	people	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pull 	 ed 	 	it	off	,	the	people	at	bolt	,	beranek	and	newman	in	boston	,	who	just	would	sketch	out	these	 structure 	 s 	 	of	what	would	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	 world 	 wide 	 	network	,	and	 sketch 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	back	of	 napkin 	 s 	 	and	on	note	 paper 	 s 	 	and	 argu 	 ing 	 	over	 d 	 inner 	 	at	howard	johnson	's	--	on	route	128	in	lexington	,	massachusetts	,	just	two	 mile 	 s 	 	from	where	i	was	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 que 	 en 	 	's	gambit	deferred	and	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	gladys	 k 	 night 	 	&	the	pips	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	``	 mid 	 night 	 	train	to	georgia	,	``	while	--	--	in	my	dad	's	big	easy	chair	,	you	know	?
so	,	three	 type 	 s 	 	of	vision	,	right	?
vision	based	on	what	one	can	not	see	:	the	vision	of	that	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	and	 un 	 know 	 able 	 	.
the	vision	of	that	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	proven	or	can	be	 a 	 s 	 certain 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	third	kind	of	vision	,	of	 some 	 thing 	 	which	can	be	,	which	may	be	,	based	on	knowledge	,	but	is	 a 	 s 	 	yet	 un 	 proven 	 	.
now	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	a	lot	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	 pur 	 suing 	 	that	sort	of	vision	in	science	,	but	i	think	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	true	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	,	it	's	true	in	 politic 	 s 	 	,	it	's	even	true	in	personal	 endeavor 	 s 	 	.
what	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	four	 bas 	 ic 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	:	learn	from	 every 	 one 	 	,	follow	no	one	,	watch	for	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	and	work	like	hell	.
i	think	these	are	the	four	 principle 	 s 	 	that	go	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	it	's	that	third	one	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	where	 vision 	 s 	 	of	the	future	begin	to	manifest	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	way	of	looking	at	the	world	,	is	,	i	think	,	 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	four	different	ways	that	manifest	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	different	 field 	 s 	 	of	endeavor	.
in	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	i	know	that	it	 result 	 s 	 	in	sort	of	a	 form 	 alist 	 	attitude	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
then	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	,	more	 classic 	 al 	 	,	attitude	which	 embrace 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	craft	.
 an 	 other 	 	one	which	 believ 	 es 	 	in	the	 pur 	 e 	 	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	of	content	.
and	then	 an 	 other 	 	which	 emphas 	 ize 	 s 	 	the	 authentic 	 ity 	 	of	human	experience	--	and	 honest 	 y 	 	,	and	 raw 	 ness 	 	.
these	are	four	 ver 	 y 	 	different	ways	of	looking	at	the	world	.	i	even	 g 	 ave 	 	them	 name 	 s 	 	.
the	 classic 	 ist 	 	,	the	 anim 	 ist 	 	,	and	 form 	 alist 	 	and	iconoclast	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	correspond	more	or	less	to	jung	's	four	 sub 	 division 	 s 	 	of	human	thought	.
and	they	reflect	a	 d 	 ich 	 otomy 	 	of	art	and	 de 	 light 	 	on	left	and	the	right	;	tradition	and	revolution	on	the	top	and	the	bottom	.
and	if	you	go	on	the	diagonal	,	you	get	content	and	form	--	and	then	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	truth	.
and	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	 appli 	 es 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	to	music	and	to	 movie 	 s 	 	and	to	fine	art	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	to	do	with	vision	at	all	,	or	for	that	matter	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	our	 con 	 ference 	 	theme	of	``	inspired	by	nature	``	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	of	the	 f 	 able 	 	of	the	frog	who	 give 	 s 	 	the	ride	to	the	scorpion	on	his	back	to	get	 a 	 cross 	 	the	river	 be 	 cause 	 	the	scorpion	 promise 	 s 	 	not	to	 s 	 ting 	 	him	,	but	then	the	scorpion	 do 	 es 	 	 s 	 ting 	 	him	 any 	 way 	 	and	they	both	die	,	but	not	before	the	frog	 ask 	 s 	 	him	why	and	the	scorpion	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	my	nature	``	--	in	that	sense	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
so	--	so	 th 	 is 	 	was	my	nature	.	the	thing	was	,	i	saw	that	the	route	that	i	took	to	 discover 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	focus	in	my	work	and	who	i	was	,	i	saw	it	 a 	 s 	 	just	 th 	 is 	 	road	to	 discover 	 y 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	just	me	 em 	 bracing 	 	my	nature	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	fall	that	far	from	the	tree	after	all	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	a	``	scientific	mind	``	do	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	?
well	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	them	,	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
and	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	was	that	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	are	a	visual	medium	,	but	they	try	to	embrace	all	of	the	 sense 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	it	.
so	,	the	different	 element 	 s 	 	of	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	like	 picture 	 s 	 	and	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	the	different	 symbol 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	in	between	that	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	 present 	 s 	 	are	all	 funnel 	 ed 	 	through	the	single	conduit	of	vision	.
so	you	have	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 re 	 semblance 	 	,	where	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 resemble 	 s 	 	the	physical	world	can	be	 abstract 	 ed 	 	in	a	couple	of	different	 direction 	 s 	 	:	 abstract 	 ed 	 	from	 re 	 semblance 	 	,	but	still	 retain 	 ing 	 	the	complete	meaning	,	or	 abstract 	 ed 	 	away	from	both	 re 	 semblance 	 	and	meaning	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	picture	plan	.
put	all	these	three	together	,	and	you	have	a	nice	little	map	of	the	entire	 bound 	 ary 	 	of	visual	 icon 	 ography 	 	which	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	can	embrace	.
and	if	you	move	to	the	right	you	 al 	 so 	 	get	language	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 abstract 	 ing 	 	even	further	from	 re 	 semblance 	 	,	but	still	 maintain 	 ing 	 	meaning	.
vision	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	to	represent	sound	and	to	understand	the	common	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	two	and	 the 	 ir 	 	common	heritage	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	to	try	to	represent	the	 text 	 ure 	 	of	sound	to	capture	 it 	 s 	 	essential	character	through	 visual 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	balance	between	the	visible	and	the	 in 	 visible 	 	in	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	is	a	kind	of	call	and	 respons 	 e 	 	in	which	the	artist	 give 	 s 	 	you	 some 	 thing 	 	to	see	 with 	 in 	 	the	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 give 	 s 	 	you	 some 	 thing 	 	to	imagine	between	the	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	sense	which	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	'	vision	 represent 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	time	.
sequence	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	 present 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	temporal	map	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	temporal	map	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 energ 	 ize 	 s 	 	modern	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	but	i	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	if	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	 al 	 so 	 	 energ 	 ize 	 s 	 	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 form 	 s 	 	,	and	i	found	some	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	same	principle	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	these	ancient	 version 	 s 	 	of	the	same	idea	.
what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	,	the	art	form	is	 coll 	 id 	 ing 	 	with	the	 give 	 n 	 	technology	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	paint	on	stone	,	like	the	tomb	of	the	scribe	in	ancient	egypt	,	or	a	bas	-	relief	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	up	a	stone	column	,	or	a	200	-	foot	-	long	 embr 	 oid 	 ery 	 	,	or	 paint 	 ed 	 	 de 	 er 	 skin 	 	and	tree	bark	running	 a 	 cross 	 	88	 accord 	 ion 	 	-	 fold 	 ed 	 	 page 	 s 	 	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	,	once	you	hit	print	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	1450	,	by	the	way	--	all	of	the	 artifact 	 s 	 	of	modern	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	start	to	present	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	:	 rect 	 i 	 linear 	 	 pan 	 el 	 	 arrange 	 ments 	 	,	simple	line	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	tone	and	a	left	-	to	-	right	 read 	 ing 	 	sequence	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	 al 	 ready 	 	start	to	see	word	 balloon 	 s 	 	and	 cap 	 tions 	 	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	just	a	hop	,	skip	and	a	jump	from	here	to	here	.
so	i	wrote	a	book	about	 th 	 is 	 	in	'93	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 finish 	 ing 	 	the	book	,	i	had	to	do	a	little	bit	of	 type 	 setting 	 	,	and	i	was	 tire 	 d 	 	of	going	to	my	local	copy	shop	to	do	it	,	so	i	 b 	 ought 	 	a	computer	.
and	it	was	just	a	little	thing	--	it	was	n't	good	for	much	 ex 	 cept 	 	text	entry	--	but	my	father	had	told	me	about	moore	's	law	,	about	moore	's	law	back	in	the	'70s	,	and	i	 k 	 new 	 	what	was	coming	.
and	so	,	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	 peel 	 ed 	 	to	see	if	the	sort	of	 change 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	we	went	from	pre	-	print	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	to	print	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	would	happen	when	we	went	beyond	,	to	post	-	print	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
so	,	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 pro 	 posed 	 	was	that	we	could	mix	the	 visual 	 s 	 	of	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	with	the	sound	,	motion	and	 inter 	 activity 	 	of	the	cd	-	roms	that	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	made	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	even	before	the	web	.
and	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	they	did	was	,	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	take	the	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	page	 a 	 s 	 	-	is	and	transplant	it	to	 monitor 	 s 	 	,	which	was	a	classic	mcluhanesque	 mistak 	 e 	 	of	 appropri 	 ating 	 	the	shape	of	the	previous	technology	 a 	 s 	 	the	content	of	the	new	technology	.
and	so	,	what	they	would	do	is	,	they	'd	have	these	 com 	 ic 	 	 page 	 s 	 	that	resemble	print	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	 page 	 s 	 	,	and	they	would	 introduc 	 e 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	sound	and	motion	.
the	problem	was	,	that	if	you	go	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	--	 th 	 is 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	that	space	 equal 	 s 	 	time	in	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	--	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	when	you	 introduc 	 e 	 	sound	and	motion	,	which	are	temporal	 phenomen 	 a 	 	that	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 represent 	 ed 	 	through	time	,	then	they	break	with	that	 continu 	 ity 	 	of	 present 	 ation 	 	.
 inter 	 activity 	 	was	 an 	 other 	 	thing	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 hyper 	 text 	 	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
but	the	thing	about	 hyper 	 text 	 	is	that	 every 	 thing 	 	in	 hyper 	 text 	 	is	either	here	,	not	here	or	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	here	;	it	's	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	non	-	spatial	.
the	distance	from	abraham	lincoln	to	a	lincoln	 pen 	 ny 	 	,	the	 pen 	 ny 	 	marshall	to	the	marshall	plan	to	``	plan	9	``	to	nine	 live 	 s 	 	:	it	's	all	the	same	.
and	--	but	in	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	in	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	work	,	every	element	of	the	work	 ha 	 s 	 	a	spatial	relationship	to	every	other	element	at	all	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	the	question	was	:	was	there	any	way	to	preserve	that	spatial	relationship	while	still	taking	advantage	of	all	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	digital	had	to	 off 	 er 	 	us	?
and	i	found	my	personal	answer	for	 th 	 is 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	ancient	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 show 	 ing 	 	you	.
each	of	them	 ha 	 s 	 	a	single	 un 	 broken 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	line	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	going	zigzag	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 wall 	 s 	 	or	 spiral 	 ing 	 	up	a	column	or	just	straight	left	to	right	,	or	even	going	in	a	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	zigzag	 a 	 cross 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	88	 accord 	 ion 	 	-	 fold 	 ed 	 	 page 	 s 	 	.
the	same	thing	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	is	that	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	that	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	through	space	you	move	through	time	is	 be 	 ing 	 	carried	out	 with 	 out 	 	any	 com 	 promise 	 	,	but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 com 	 promise 	 s 	 	when	print	hit	.
 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	 space 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	so	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	of	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	was	 be 	 ing 	 	broken	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	o.k	.	,	well	,	if	that	's	true	,	is	there	any	way	,	when	we	go	beyond	 to 	 day 	 	's	print	,	to	 some 	 how 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	that	back	?
now	,	the	monitor	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	page	,	 technical 	 ly 	 	,	right	?
it	's	a	different	shape	,	but	other	than	that	it	's	the	same	 bas 	 ic 	 	 limit 	 ation 	 	.
but	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	if	you	look	at	the	monitor	 a 	 s 	 	a	page	,	but	not	if	you	look	at	the	monitor	 a 	 s 	 	a	window	.
and	that	's	what	i	 pro 	 posed 	 	:	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	could	create	these	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	on	an	infinite	canvas	:	 a 	 long 	 	the	x	axis	and	the	y	axis	and	 stair 	 case 	 s 	 	.
we	could	do	 circul 	 ar 	 	 narrative 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 circul 	 ar 	 	.
we	could	do	a	turn	in	a	story	that	was	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	turn	.
parallel	 narrative 	 s 	 	could	be	 liter 	 ally 	 	parallel	.
x	,	y	and	 al 	 so 	 	z	.
so	i	had	all	these	 not 	 ions 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	back	in	the	late	'90s	,	and	other	people	in	my	business	thought	i	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	crazy	,	but	a	lot	of	people	then	went	on	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	it	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	couple	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	early	collage	 com 	 ic 	 	by	a	fellow	named	jason	lex	.
and	notice	what	's	going	on	here	.
what	i	'm	 search 	 ing 	 	for	is	a	 dur 	 able 	 	mutation	--	that	's	what	all	of	us	are	 search 	 ing 	 	for	.
 a 	 s 	 	media	head	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	era	,	we	are	looking	for	 mutation 	 s 	 	that	are	 dur 	 able 	 	,	that	have	some	sort	of	 stay 	 ing 	 	power	.
now	,	we	're	taking	 th 	 is 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	of	 present 	 ing 	 	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	in	a	visual	medium	,	and	then	we	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	it	through	all	the	way	from	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	end	.
that	's	that	entire	 com 	 ic 	 	you	just	saw	is	up	on	the	screen	right	now	.
but	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	it	one	piece	at	a	time	,	that	's	just	where	the	technology	is	right	now	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	technology	 evolve 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	full	 immers 	 ive 	 	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	and	 what 	 not 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	will	 on 	 ly 	 	grow	.
it	will	adapt	.	it	will	adapt	to	 it 	 s 	 	environment	:	it	's	a	 dur 	 able 	 	mutation	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	i	'll	show	you	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	by	drew	weing	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	pup	 contempl 	 ates 	 	the	heat	death	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	``
see	what	's	going	on	here	 a 	 s 	 	we	draw	these	 st 	 ories 	 	on	an	infinite	canvas	is	you	're	creating	a	more	 pur 	 e 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	medium	is	all	about	.
we	'll	go	by	 th 	 is 	 	a	little	 quick 	 ly 	 	--	you	get	the	idea	.
i	just	want	to	get	to	the	last	 pan 	 el 	 	.
there	we	go	.
just	one	more	.
talk	about	your	infinite	canvas	.
it	's	by	a	guy	named	daniel	merlin	goodbrey	in	britain	.
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	media	,	all	media	,	provide	us	a	window	back	 in 	 to 	 	our	world	.
now	,	it	could	be	that	motion	 picture 	 s 	 	--	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	it	--	some	sort	of	 immers 	 ive 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	,	is	going	to	provide	us	with	our	most	efficient	 es 	 cape 	 	from	the	world	that	we	're	in	.
that	's	why	most	people	turn	to	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	is	to	 es 	 cape 	 	.
but	media	 provide 	 s 	 	us	with	a	window	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	that	we	live	in	.
and	when	media	evolve	so	that	the	 ident 	 ity 	 	of	the	media	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	're	looking	at	is	,	you	're	looking	at	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	 cub 	 ed 	 	:	you	're	looking	at	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	that	are	more	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	-	like	than	they	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	before	.
when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	you	provide	people	with	 multi 	 ple 	 	ways	of	re	-	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	world	through	different	 window 	 s 	 	,	and	when	you	do	that	,	it	 allow 	 s 	 	them	to	triangulate	the	world	that	they	live	in	and	see	 it 	 s 	 	shape	.
and	that	's	why	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
one	of	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	but	i	've	got	to	go	now	.
thank	you	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	me	.
