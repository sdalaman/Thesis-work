if	you	're	at	all	like	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	do	with	the	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	summer	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	in	san	francisco	:	you	build	 experiment 	 al 	 	kite	-	powered	 hydro 	 foil 	 s 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	more	than	30	 knot 	 s 	 	.
and	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	there	is	 in 	 credible 	 	power	in	the	wind	,	and	it	can	do	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	one	day	,	a	vessel	not	 un 	 like 	 	 th 	 is 	 	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	break	the	world	speed	record	.
but	 kite 	 s 	 	are	n't	just	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 kite 	 s 	 	:	i	'm	going	to	give	you	a	brief	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	tell	you	about	the	 magnific 	 ent 	 	future	of	every	child	's	 favor 	 ite 	 	 play 	 thing 	 	.
so	,	 kite 	 s 	 	are	more	than	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	the	chinese	used	them	for	 militar 	 y 	 	 application 	 s 	 	,	and	even	for	 lift 	 ing 	 	men	.
so	they	 k 	 new 	 	at	that	stage	they	could	carry	large	 weight 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	why	there	is	a	hole	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	man	.
in	1827	,	a	fellow	 call 	 ed 	 	george	pocock	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	the	use	of	 kite 	 s 	 	for	 tow 	 ing 	 	 bug 	 gie 	 s 	 	in	 race 	 s 	 	against	horse	 carriage 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	english	 country 	 side 	 	.
then	of	course	,	at	the	dawn	of	 av 	 iation 	 	,	all	of	the	great	 inventor 	 s 	 	of	the	time	--	like	hargreaves	,	like	langley	,	even	alexander	graham	bell	,	inventor	of	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	who	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kite	--	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	so	in	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	 av 	 iation 	 	.
then	these	two	 fellow 	 s 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 kite 	 s 	 	to	develop	the	control	 system 	 s 	 	that	would	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 en 	 able 	 	powered	human	flight	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	of	course	orville	and	wilbur	wright	,	and	the	wright	 fly 	 er 	 	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	 kite 	 s 	 	led	to	 th 	 is 	 	 moment 	 ous 	 	occasion	,	where	we	powered	up	and	took	off	for	the	first	-	ever	12	-	second	human	flight	.
and	that	was	fantastic	for	the	future	of	commercial	 av 	 iation 	 	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	 relegate 	 d 	 	 kite 	 s 	 	once	 aga 	 in 	 	to	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	children	's	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
that	was	 un 	 til 	 	the	1970s	,	where	we	had	the	last	energy	crisis	.
and	a	fabulous	man	 call 	 ed 	 	 mile 	 s 	 	loyd	who	 live 	 s 	 	on	the	 out 	 skirt 	 s 	 	of	san	francisco	,	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	 semi 	 nal 	 	paper	that	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	in	the	journal	of	energy	about	how	to	use	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	 air 	 plane 	 	on	a	piece	of	string	to	generate	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
the	real	key	 observ 	 ation 	 	he	made	is	that	a	free	-	 fly 	 ing 	 	wing	can	 s 	 weep 	 	through	more	sky	and	generate	more	power	in	a	unit	of	time	than	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	-	wing	turbine	.
so	 turbine 	 s 	 	grew	.	and	they	can	now	span	up	to	three	hundred	feet	at	the	hub	height	,	but	they	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	go	a	lot	 high 	 er 	 	,	and	more	height	is	where	the	more	wind	is	,	and	more	power	--	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	.
so	cut	to	now	.	we	still	have	an	energy	crisis	,	and	now	we	have	a	climate	crisis	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	you	know	,	so	 human 	 s 	 	generate	about	12	trillion	 watt 	 s 	 	,	or	12	 tera 	 watt 	 s 	 	,	from	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
and	al	gore	 ha 	 s 	 	spoken	to	why	we	need	to	hit	one	of	these	 target 	 s 	 	,	and	in	 re 	 ality 	 	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	in	the	next	30	to	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	make	10	trillion	 watt 	 s 	 	or	more	of	new	clean	energy	 some 	 how 	 	.
wind	is	the	second	-	largest	 renew 	 able 	 	resource	after	solar	:	3600	 tera 	 watt 	 s 	 	,	more	than	 en 	 ough 	 	to	supply	 human 	 ity 	 	200	 time 	 s 	 	over	.
the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	it	is	in	the	 high 	 er 	 	 altitude 	 s 	 	,	above	300	feet	,	where	we	do	n't	have	a	technology	 a 	 s 	 	yet	to	get	there	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	dawn	of	the	new	age	of	 kite 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	test	 s 	 ite 	 	on	maui	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sky	.
i	'm	now	going	to	show	you	the	first	autonomous	generation	of	power	by	every	child	's	 favor 	 ite 	 	 play 	 thing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	tell	,	you	need	to	be	a	robot	to	fly	 th 	 is 	 	thing	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 hour 	 s 	 	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	you	a	little	 nause 	 ous 	 	.
and	here	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	generating	about	10	 kilowatt 	 s 	 	--	so	,	 en 	 ough 	 	to	power	 prob 	 ably 	 	five	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	--	with	a	kite	not	much	 large 	 r 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	piano	.
and	the	real	significant	thing	here	is	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	control	 system 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	did	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	,	that	would	 en 	 able 	 	 sustain 	 ed 	 	,	long	-	 dur 	 ation 	 	flight	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	hurt	to	do	it	in	a	location	like	 th 	 is 	 	either	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	for	a	kite	 fli 	 er 	 	of	 pe 	 e 	 ing 	 	in	the	snow	--	that	's	 trac 	 ing 	 	your	name	in	the	sky	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	.
so	we	're	beyond	the	12	-	second	 step 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	megawatt	-	scale	 machine 	 s 	 	that	fly	at	2000	feet	and	generate	 ton 	 s 	 	of	clean	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
so	you	ask	,	how	big	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	paper	plane	would	be	 may 	 be 	 	a	--	oop	!
that	would	be	 en 	 ough 	 	to	power	your	cell	phone	.
your	cessna	would	be	230	 kill 	 o 	 watt 	 s 	 	.
if	you	'd	loan	me	your	gulfstream	,	i	'll	rip	 it 	 s 	 	 wing 	 s 	 	off	and	generate	you	a	megawatt	.
if	you	give	me	a	747	,	i	'll	make	six	 megawatt 	 s 	 	,	which	is	more	than	the	largest	wind	 turbine 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	the	spruce	goose	would	be	a	15	-	megawatt	wing	.
so	that	is	 au 	 d 	 acious 	 	,	you	say	.	i	agree	.
but	 au 	 d 	 acious 	 	is	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	before	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 refrige 	 rator 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	,	 churn 	 ing 	 	out	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	for	world	war	ii	.
prior	to	world	war	ii	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	making	1000	 plane 	 s 	 	a	year	.
by	1945	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	making	100,000	.
with	 th 	 is 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	and	100,000	 plane 	 s 	 	a	year	,	we	could	make	all	of	america	's	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	story	about	the	 au 	 d 	 acious 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	of	young	people	with	these	 dream 	 s 	 	.	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	.
i	am	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	work	with	30	of	them	.
and	i	think	we	need	to	support	all	of	the	 dream 	 s 	 	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	out	there	 do 	 ing 	 	these	crazy	 thing 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
