thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	chris	.	 every 	 body 	 	who	came	up	here	 s 	 aid 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	.	i	do	n't	know	if	i	'm	 scar 	 ed 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	first	time	of	 address 	 ing 	 	an	audience	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	have	any	smart	technology	for	you	to	look	at	.
there	are	no	 slide 	 s 	 	,	so	you	'll	just	have	to	be	content	with	me	.
what	i	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	is	share	with	you	a	couple	of	 st 	 ories 	 	and	talk	about	a	different	africa	.
 al 	 ready 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	some	 all 	 usion 	 s 	 	to	the	africa	that	you	hear	about	all	the	time	:	the	africa	of	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	,	the	africa	of	malaria	,	the	africa	of	poverty	,	the	africa	of	conflict	,	and	the	africa	of	 disaster 	 s 	 	.
while	it	is	true	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	on	,	there	's	an	africa	that	you	do	n't	hear	about	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	'm	 puzzl 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	ask	 my 	 self 	 	why	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	africa	that	is	changing	,	that	chris	 allud 	 ed 	 	to	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	africa	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	africa	where	people	want	to	take	charge	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 future 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 ies 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	africa	where	people	are	looking	for	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	that	's	what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	i	want	to	start	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	a	story	about	that	change	in	africa	.
on	15th	of	september	2005	,	mr.	diepreye	alamieyeseigha	,	a	 govern 	 or 	 	of	one	of	the	oil	-	rich	 state 	 s 	 	of	nigeria	,	was	 arrest 	 ed 	 	by	the	london	 metro 	 politan 	 	police	on	a	visit	to	london	.
he	was	 arrest 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 transfer 	 s 	 	of	eight	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	some	 dorm 	 ant 	 	 account 	 s 	 	that	 belong 	 ed 	 	to	him	and	his	family	.
 th 	 is 	 	arrest	 occur 	 red 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	 co 	 operation 	 	between	the	london	 metro 	 politan 	 	police	and	the	economic	and	financial	 crime 	 s 	 	commission	of	nigeria	--	led	by	one	of	our	most	able	and	 courage 	 ous 	 	people	:	mr.	nuhu	ribadu	.
alamieyeseigha	was	 arra 	 ign 	 ed 	 	in	london	.
due	to	some	slip	-	 up 	 s 	 	,	he	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 es 	 cape 	 	 dress 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	woman	and	ran	from	london	back	to	nigeria	where	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	our	 constit 	 ution 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	in	 off 	 ice 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 govern 	 ors 	 	,	 p 	 resident 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	have	 immun 	 ity 	 	and	can	not	be	 prosecut 	 ed 	 	.	but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	:	people	 we 	 re 	 	so	 out 	 rag 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	that	it	was	possible	for	his	state	 legisl 	 ature 	 	to	 im 	 peach 	 	him	and	get	him	out	of	 off 	 ice 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	alams	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	call	him	for	short	--	is	in	jail	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	story	about	the	fact	that	people	in	africa	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 toler 	 ate 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	story	about	the	fact	that	people	want	 the 	 ir 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	good	,	and	not	taken	out	to	 place 	 s 	 	where	they	'll	benefit	just	a	few	of	the	elite	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	when	you	hear	about	the	corrupt	africa	--	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	all	the	time	--	i	want	you	to	know	that	the	people	and	the	 government 	 s 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	hard	to	fight	 th 	 is 	 	in	some	of	the	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	that	some	 success 	 es 	 	are	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	the	problem	is	over	?	the	answer	is	no	.
there	's	still	a	long	way	to	go	,	but	that	there	's	a	will	there	.
and	that	 success 	 es 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 chalk 	 ed 	 	up	on	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	fight	.
so	when	you	hear	about	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	do	n't	just	feel	that	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	that	you	ca	n't	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	any	african	country	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.	that	is	not	the	case	.
there	's	a	will	to	fight	,	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	that	fight	is	 on 	 going 	 	and	is	 be 	 ing 	 	won	.	in	 other 	 s 	 	,	like	mine	,	where	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 dictator 	 ship 	 	in	nigeria	,	the	fight	is	 on 	 going 	 	and	we	have	a	long	way	to	go	.
but	the	truth	of	the	matter	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	on	.
the	 result 	 s 	 	are	 show 	 ing 	 	:	 in 	 dependent 	 	 monitor 	 ing 	 	by	the	world	bank	and	other	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	show	that	in	 man 	 y 	 	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	the	trend	is	 down 	 ward 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	and	 govern 	 ance 	 	is	 improv 	 ing 	 	.
a	 stud 	 y 	 	by	the	economic	commission	for	africa	 show 	 ed 	 	a	clear	trend	 up 	 ward 	 s 	 	in	 govern 	 ance 	 	in	28	african	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	let	me	say	just	one	more	thing	before	i	 leav 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	area	of	 govern 	 ance 	 	.
that	is	that	people	talk	about	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
all	the	time	when	they	talk	about	it	you	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	think	about	africa	.
that	's	the	image	:	african	 count 	 ries 	 	.	but	let	me	say	 th 	 is 	 	:	if	alams	was	able	to	export	eight	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	account	in	london	--	if	the	other	people	who	had	taken	money	,	 estimate 	 d 	 	at	20	to	40	billion	now	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	'	 mon 	 ies 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 a 	 broad 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	if	they	're	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	is	that	?	is	that	not	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	?
in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	if	you	 receiv 	 e 	 	 stole 	 n 	 	 good 	 s 	 	,	are	you	not	 prosecut 	 ed 	 	?
so	when	we	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	let	us	 al 	 so 	 	think	about	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	other	side	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	--	where	the	money	's	going	and	what	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	stop	it	.
i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	an	 initi 	 ative 	 	now	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	world	bank	,	on	asset	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	what	we	can	to	get	the	 mon 	 ies 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	taken	 a 	 broad 	 	--	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	'	 money 	 s 	 	--	to	get	that	 s 	 ent 	 	back	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	can	get	the	20	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	out	there	back	,	it	may	be	far	more	for	some	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	than	all	the	aid	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	put	together	.
the	second	thing	i	want	to	talk	about	is	the	will	for	reform	.
africans	,	after	--	they	're	 tire 	 d 	 	,	we	're	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	the	subject	of	 every 	 body 	 	's	 char 	 ity 	 	and	care	.
we	are	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	,	but	we	know	that	we	can	take	charge	of	our	own	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 ies 	 	if	we	have	the	will	to	reform	.
and	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	african	 count 	 ries 	 	now	is	a	 real 	 ization 	 	that	no	one	can	do	it	but	us	.	we	have	to	do	it	.
we	can	 invit 	 e 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	who	can	support	us	,	but	we	have	to	start	.
we	have	to	reform	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	change	our	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 be 	 come 	 	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	,	be	more	open	to	change	and	to	information	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	in	one	of	the	largest	 count 	 ries 	 	on	the	continent	,	nigeria	.
in	fact	,	if	you	're	not	in	nigeria	,	you	're	not	in	africa	.
i	want	to	tell	you	that	.
one	in	four	sub	-	saharan	africans	is	nigerian	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	140	million	dynamic	people	--	chaotic	people	--	but	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	people	.	you	'll	never	be	 bor 	 ed 	 	.
what	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	we	had	to	take	charge	and	reform	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	with	the	support	of	a	 lead 	 er 	 	who	was	 will 	 ing 	 	,	at	the	time	,	to	do	the	 reform 	 s 	 	,	we	put	forward	a	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	reform	program	,	which	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
not	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	fund	.	not	the	world	bank	,	where	i	 work 	 ed 	 	for	21	 year 	 s 	 	and	rose	to	be	a	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	.
no	one	can	do	it	for	you	.	you	have	to	do	it	for	 your 	 self 	 	.
we	put	together	a	program	that	would	,	one	:	get	the	state	out	of	 business 	 es 	 	it	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	--	it	had	no	business	 be 	 ing 	 	in	.
the	state	should	not	be	in	the	business	of	producing	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 in 	 efficient 	 	and	 in 	 compete 	 nt 	 	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 privat 	 ize 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 enterprise 	 s 	 	.
we	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 liberal 	 ize 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 market 	 s 	 	.
can	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	prior	to	 th 	 is 	 	reform	--	which	 start 	 ed 	 	at	the	end	of	2003	,	when	i	left	washington	to	go	and	take	up	the	post	of	finance	 mini 	 ster 	 	--	we	had	a	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	company	that	was	 on 	 ly 	 	able	to	develop	4,500	 land 	 lines 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	entire	30	-	year	 histo 	 ry 	 	?
 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	in	my	country	was	a	huge	 luxur 	 y 	 	.
you	could	n't	get	it	.	you	had	to	bribe	.
you	had	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	to	get	your	phone	.
when	 p 	 resident 	 	obasanjo	 support 	 ed 	 	and	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	 liberal 	 ization 	 	of	the	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	sector	,	we	went	from	4,500	 land 	 lines 	 	to	32	million	gsm	lines	,	and	 count 	 ing 	 	.
nigeria	's	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	market	is	the	second	-	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	in	the	world	,	after	 chin 	 a 	 	.	we	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 invest 	 ments 	 	of	about	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	in	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	.	and	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	a	few	smart	people	.
the	 smart 	 est 	 	one	,	first	to	come	in	,	was	the	mtn	company	of	south	africa	.
and	in	the	three	 year 	 s 	 	that	i	was	finance	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	they	made	an	average	of	360	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	profit	per	year	.
360	million	in	a	market	--	in	a	country	that	is	a	poor	country	,	with	an	average	per	capita	income	just	under	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	capita	.
so	the	market	is	there	.
when	they	 ke 	 pt 	 	 th 	 is 	 	under	 wrap 	 s 	 	,	but	soon	 other 	 s 	 	got	to	know	.
nigerians	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	develop	some	 wire 	 less 	 	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	and	three	or	four	 other 	 s 	 	have	come	in	.
but	there	's	a	huge	market	out	there	,	and	people	do	n't	know	about	it	,	or	they	do	n't	want	to	know	.
so	 privat 	 ization 	 	is	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
the	other	thing	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 d 	 one 	 	is	to	manage	our	 finance 	 s 	 	better	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	's	going	to	help	you	and	support	you	if	you	're	not	 man 	 aging 	 	your	own	 finance 	 s 	 	well	.
and	nigeria	,	with	the	oil	sector	,	had	the	reputation	of	 be 	 ing 	 	corrupt	and	not	 man 	 aging 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	public	 finance 	 s 	 	well	.
so	what	did	we	try	to	do	?	we	 introduc 	 ed 	 	a	 fisc 	 al 	 	rule	that	de	-	linked	our	budget	from	the	oil	price	.
before	we	used	to	just	budget	on	 what 	 ever 	 	oil	we	 br 	 ing 	 	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	oil	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	,	most	revenue	-	 earn 	 ing 	 	sector	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	:	70	percent	of	our	 revenue 	 s 	 	come	from	oil	.
we	de	-	linked	that	,	and	once	we	did	it	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	budget	at	a	price	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	lower	than	the	oil	price	and	 s 	 ave 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	was	above	that	price	.
we	did	n't	know	we	could	pull	it	off	;	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	controversial	.
but	what	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	did	was	that	the	 volatil 	 ity 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	present	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	our	economic	 develop 	 ment 	 	--	where	,	even	if	oil	 price 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	high	,	we	would	grow	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
when	they	 crash 	 ed 	 	,	we	 crash 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	could	 hard 	 ly 	 	even	pay	 any 	 thing 	 	,	any	 s 	 al 	 aries 	 	,	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
that	 smooth 	 ened 	 	out	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 s 	 ave 	 	,	just	before	i	left	,	27	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	went	to	our	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	--	when	i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	2003	,	we	had	seven	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	.
by	the	time	i	left	,	we	had	gone	up	to	 al 	 most 	 	30	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	now	,	we	have	about	40	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	due	to	proper	management	of	our	 finance 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 shore 	 s 	 	up	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	 make 	 s 	 	it	 s 	 table 	 	.
our	 ex 	 change 	 	rate	that	used	to	 fluctu 	 ate 	 	all	the	time	is	now	 fair 	 ly 	 	 s 	 table 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	so	that	business	people	have	a	 predict 	 ability 	 	of	 price 	 s 	 	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
we	 br 	 ought 	 	 infla 	 tion 	 	down	from	28	percent	to	about	11	percent	.
and	we	had	gdp	grow	from	an	average	of	2.3	percent	the	previous	decade	to	about	6.5	percent	now	.
so	all	the	 change 	 s 	 	and	 reform 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	make	have	 show 	 n 	 	up	in	 result 	 s 	 	that	are	 measur 	 able 	 	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	what	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	to	get	away	from	oil	and	 divers 	 ify 	 	--	and	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	big	country	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	africa	--	what	was	 remark 	 able 	 	is	that	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	growth	came	not	from	the	oil	sector	 al 	 one 	 	,	but	from	non	-	oil	.
 agricultur 	 e 	 	grew	at	better	than	eight	percent	.
 a 	 s 	 	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	sector	grew	,	housing	and	construction	,	and	i	could	go	on	and	on	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	to	you	that	once	you	get	the	macro	-	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 straight 	 ened 	 	out	,	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	other	 sector 	 s 	 	are	enormous	.
we	have	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	.
we	have	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	solid	 mineral 	 s 	 	.	we	have	a	lot	of	 mineral 	 s 	 	that	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	even	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	or	 explore 	 d 	 	.	and	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 with 	 out 	 	the	proper	 legisl 	 ation 	 	to	make	that	possible	,	that	would	n't	happen	.	so	we	've	now	got	a	 min 	 ing 	 	code	that	is	 compar 	 able 	 	with	some	of	the	best	in	the	world	.
we	have	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	housing	and	real	 e 	 state 	 	.
there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	a	country	of	140	million	people	--	no	 shop 	 ping 	 	 mall 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	them	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 invest 	 ment 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	 some 	 one 	 	that	 excit 	 ed 	 	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	of	people	.
and	now	,	we	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	which	the	 business 	 es 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	mall	are	 do 	 ing 	 	four	 time 	 s 	 	the	 turn 	 over 	 	that	they	had	 project 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	huge	 thing 	 s 	 	in	construction	,	real	 e 	 state 	 	,	mortgage	 market 	 s 	 	.	financial	 service 	 s 	 	:	we	had	89	 bank 	 s 	 	.	too	 man 	 y 	 	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	real	business	.
we	 con 	 solid 	 ated 	 	them	from	89	to	25	 bank 	 s 	 	by	 requir 	 ing 	 	that	they	 in 	 crease 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	capital	--	share	capital	.
and	it	went	from	about	25	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	150	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
the	 bank 	 s 	 	--	these	 bank 	 s 	 	are	now	 con 	 solid 	 ated 	 	,	and	that	 strength 	 en 	 ing 	 	of	the	 bank 	 ing 	 	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 attract 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 invest 	 ment 	 	from	 out 	 side 	 	.

and	i	can	go	on	.	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	on	and	on	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	.
we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	with	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	sector	.
so	in	financial	 service 	 s 	 	,	a	great	deal	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
in	 tour 	 ism 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	african	 count 	 ries 	 	,	a	great	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
and	that	's	what	 man 	 y 	 	people	know	east	africa	for	:	the	 wild 	 life 	 	,	the	 elephant 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	.
but	 man 	 aging 	 	the	 tour 	 ism 	 	market	in	a	way	that	can	 re 	 ally 	 	benefit	the	people	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
so	what	am	i	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	?	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	you	that	there	's	a	new	wave	on	the	continent	.
a	new	wave	of	 open 	 ness 	 	and	 democrat 	 ization 	 	in	which	,	since	2000	,	more	than	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	african	 count 	 ries 	 	have	had	multi	-	party	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 election 	 s 	 	.
not	all	of	them	have	 be 	 en 	 	perfect	,	or	will	be	,	but	the	trend	is	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	you	that	since	the	past	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	average	rate	of	growth	on	the	continent	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	from	about	2.5	percent	to	about	five	percent	per	annum	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	better	than	the	performance	of	 man 	 y 	 	oecd	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	it	's	clear	that	 thing 	 s 	 	are	changing	.
 conflict 	 s 	 	are	down	on	the	continent	;	from	about	12	 conflict 	 s 	 	a	decade	ago	,	we	are	down	to	three	or	four	 conflict 	 s 	 	--	one	of	the	most	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	of	course	,	of	which	is	darfur	.
and	,	you	know	,	you	have	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	effect	where	if	 some 	 thing 	 	is	going	on	in	one	part	of	the	continent	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	entire	continent	is	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
but	you	should	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	continent	is	not	--	is	a	continent	of	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	not	one	country	.
and	if	we	are	down	to	three	or	four	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	invest	in	 s 	 table 	 	,	growing	,	 excit 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	where	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	want	to	just	make	one	point	about	 th 	 is 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
the	best	way	to	help	africans	 to 	 day 	 	is	to	help	them	to	stand	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	feet	.
and	the	best	way	to	do	that	is	by	 help 	 ing 	 	create	 job 	 s 	 	.
there	's	no	issue	with	 fight 	 ing 	 	malaria	and	 put 	 ting 	 	money	in	that	and	saving	children	's	 live 	 s 	 	.	that	's	not	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	.	that	is	fine	.
but	imagine	the	impact	on	a	family	:	if	the	 parent 	 s 	 	can	be	 employ 	 ed 	 	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	go	to	school	,	that	they	can	buy	the	 drug 	 s 	 	to	fight	the	disease	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
if	we	can	invest	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	make	money	whilst	creating	 job 	 s 	 	and	 help 	 ing 	 	people	stand	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	feet	,	is	n't	that	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	?	is	n't	that	the	way	to	go	?
and	i	want	to	say	that	some	of	the	best	people	to	invest	in	on	the	continent	are	the	women	.
i	have	a	cd	here	.	i	'm	sorry	that	i	did	n't	say	 any 	 thing 	 	on	time	.
 other 	 wise 	 	,	i	would	have	 like 	 d 	 	you	to	have	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	africa	:	open	for	business	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	video	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	won	an	 a 	 ward 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	best	 document 	 ary 	 	of	the	year	.
understand	that	the	woman	who	made	it	is	going	to	be	in	tanzania	,	where	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	session	in	june	.
but	it	 show 	 s 	 	you	africans	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	african	women	,	who	against	all	 odd 	 s 	 	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	 business 	 es 	 	,	some	of	them	world	-	class	.
one	of	the	women	in	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	adenike	ogunlesi	,	making	children	's	 clothe 	 s 	 	--	which	she	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	hobby	and	grew	 in 	 to 	 	a	business	.
 mix 	 ing 	 	african	 material 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	,	with	 material 	 s 	 	from	 else 	 where 	 	.
so	,	she	'll	make	a	little	pair	of	 dung 	 are 	 es 	 	with	 cord 	 uro 	 y 	 s 	 	,	with	african	material	 mix 	 ed 	 	in	.	 ver 	 y 	 	creative	 design 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	stage	where	she	even	had	an	order	from	wal	-	mart	.
for	10,000	 piece 	 s 	 	.
so	that	 show 	 s 	 	you	that	we	have	people	who	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	women	are	diligent	.	they	are	focused	;	they	work	hard	.
i	could	go	on	giving	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	:	beatrice	gakuba	of	rwanda	,	who	 open 	 ed 	 	up	a	flower	business	and	is	now	 export 	 ing 	 	to	the	dutch	auction	in	amsterdam	each	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	is	 employ 	 ing 	 	200	other	women	and	men	to	work	with	her	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	are	 starv 	 ed 	 	for	capital	to	expand	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 believ 	 es 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	our	 count 	 ries 	 	that	we	can	do	what	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	.	 no 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	a	market	.
 no 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	there	's	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
but	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 mis 	 s 	 	the	boat	now	,	will	 mis 	 s 	 	it	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
so	if	you	want	to	be	in	africa	,	think	about	 invest 	 ing 	 	.
think	about	the	beatrices	,	think	about	the	adenikes	of	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	whilst	at	the	same	time	making	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	fellow	men	and	women	are	 employ 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	the	children	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	get	educated	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	are	 earn 	 ing 	 	 ad 	 equate 	 	income	.
so	i	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	explore	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
when	you	go	to	tanzania	,	listen	 care 	 fully 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	will	hear	of	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 open 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	there	will	be	for	you	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	that	will	do	good	for	the	continent	,	for	the	people	and	for	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
