my	 top 	 ic 	 	is	economic	growth	in	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	.
and	the	question	i	want	to	explore	with	you	is	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	or	 ha 	 s 	 	 hind 	 er 	 ed 	 	economic	growth	.
you	may	say	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	fair	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 select 	 ing 	 	two	 count 	 ries 	 	to	make	a	case	against	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	is	what	i	'm	going	to	do	.
i	'm	going	to	use	these	two	 count 	 ries 	 	to	make	an	economic	argument	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	against	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
the	first	question	there	is	why	 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	so	much	 fast 	 er 	 	than	india	.
over	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	gdp	growth	rates	,	 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	at	twice	the	rate	of	india	.
in	the	last	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	two	 count 	 ries 	 	have	 beg 	 un 	 	to	 converg 	 e 	 	 some 	 what 	 	in	economic	growth	.
but	over	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	 chin 	 a 	 	 un 	 doubt 	 ed 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	much	better	than	india	.
is	 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	shanghai	and	india	 ha 	 s 	 	mumbai	.
look	at	the	 sky 	 line 	 	of	shanghai	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	pudong	area	.
the	picture	on	india	is	the	dharavi	 s 	 lum 	 	of	mumbai	in	india	.
the	idea	there	 be 	 hind 	 	these	two	 picture 	 s 	 	is	that	the	chinese	government	can	act	above	rule	of	law	.
it	can	plan	for	the	long	-	term	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	the	country	and	in	the	process	,	 e 	 vict 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	--	that	's	just	a	small	technical	issue	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	in	india	,	you	can	not	do	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	listen	to	the	public	.
you	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	by	the	public	's	opinion	.
even	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	manmohan	singh	 agree 	 s 	 	with	that	view	.
in	an	interview	 print 	 ed 	 	in	the	financial	press	of	india	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	make	mumbai	 an 	 other 	 	shanghai	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	oxford	-	trained	economist	 steep 	 ed 	 	in	 human 	 istic 	 	 value 	 s 	 	,	and	yet	he	 agree 	 s 	 	with	the	high	-	pressure	 tactic 	 s 	 	of	shanghai	.
so	let	me	call	it	the	shanghai	model	of	economic	growth	,	that	 emphas 	 ize 	 s 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	for	promoting	economic	 develop 	 ment 	 	:	 infra 	 structure 	 s 	 	,	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	,	 high 	 ways 	 	,	 bridge 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
and	you	need	a	strong	government	to	do	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	not	respect	private	 proper 	 ty 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.
you	can	not	be	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	by	the	public	's	opinion	.
you	need	 al 	 so 	 	state	 owner 	 ship 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	of	land	 asset 	 s 	 	,	in	order	to	build	and	roll	out	 infra 	 structure 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
the	 implic 	 ation 	 	of	that	model	is	that	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	a	 hind 	 r 	 ance 	 	for	economic	growth	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	facilitator	of	economic	growth	.
here	's	the	key	question	.
just	how	 import 	 ant 	 	are	 infra 	 structure 	 s 	 	for	economic	growth	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	key	issue	.
if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 infra 	 structure 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	economic	growth	,	then	you	would	 argu 	 e 	 	a	strong	government	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	promote	growth	.
if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 infra 	 structure 	 s 	 	are	not	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	 believ 	 e 	 	,	then	you	will	put	less	 emphas 	 is 	 	on	strong	government	.
so	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	that	question	,	let	me	give	you	two	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	for	the	sake	of	 b 	 rev 	 ity 	 	,	i	'll	call	one	country	country	1	and	the	other	country	country	2	.
country	1	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 system 	 atic 	 	advantage	over	country	2	in	 infra 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
country	1	 ha 	 s 	 	more	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	and	country	1	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 long 	 er 	 	system	of	 rail 	 ways 	 	.
so	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	ask	you	,	``	which	is	 chin 	 a 	 	and	which	is	india	,	and	which	country	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	 fast 	 er 	 	?	``
if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	view	,	then	you	will	say	,	``	country	1	must	be	 chin 	 a 	 	.
they	must	have	 d 	 one 	 	better	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	economic	growth	.
and	country	2	is	possibly	india	.	``
 actual 	 ly 	 	the	country	with	more	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	is	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	,	and	the	data	 refer 	 red 	 	to	1989	.
after	the	country	 report 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	on	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	the	country	 collapse 	 d 	 	.
that	's	not	too	good	.
the	picture	there	is	khrushchev	.
i	know	that	in	1989	he	no	 long 	 er 	 	 rul 	 ed 	 	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	,	but	that	's	the	best	picture	that	i	can	find	.
 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	 infra 	 structure 	 s 	 	do	not	guarantee	you	economic	growth	.
country	2	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 few 	 er 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	is	 chin 	 a 	 	.
since	1989	,	the	country	 ha 	 s 	 	 perform 	 ed 	 	at	a	double	-	digit	rate	every	year	for	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	you	know	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	other	than	the	fact	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	you	would	have	made	a	poor	 predict 	 ion 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	economic	growth	in	the	next	two	 decade 	 s 	 	.
country	1	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 long 	 er 	 	system	of	 rail 	 ways 	 	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	india	.
and	country	2	is	 chin 	 a 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	little	known	fact	about	the	two	 count 	 ries 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	huge	 infra 	 structure 	 	advantage	over	india	.
but	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	late	1990s	,	 chin 	 a 	 	had	an	 infra 	 structure 	 	 dis 	 advantage 	 	vis	-	a	-	vis	india	.
in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	most	common	mode	of	 transport 	 ation 	 	is	the	 rail 	 ways 	 	,	and	the	british	built	a	lot	of	 rail 	 ways 	 	in	india	.
india	is	the	 small 	 er 	 	of	the	two	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	yet	it	had	a	 long 	 er 	 	system	of	 rail 	 ways 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	late	1990s	.
so	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	 infra 	 structure 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	explain	why	 chin 	 a 	 	did	better	before	the	late	1990s	,	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	india	.
in	fact	,	if	you	look	at	the	evidence	 world 	 wide 	 	,	the	evidence	is	more	 support 	 ive 	 	of	the	view	that	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	result	of	economic	growth	.
the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 grow 	 s 	 	,	government	 accumul 	 ates 	 	more	 resource 	 s 	 	,	and	the	government	can	invest	in	 infra 	 structure 	 	--	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 infra 	 structure 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	cause	for	economic	growth	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	the	story	of	the	chinese	economic	growth	.
let	me	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	question	more	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
is	 demo 	 cracy 	 	bad	for	economic	growth	?
now	let	's	turn	to	two	 count 	 ries 	 	,	country	a	and	country	b	.
country	a	,	in	1990	,	had	about	$	300	per	capita	gdp	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	country	b	,	which	had	$	460	in	per	capita	gdp	.
by	2008	,	country	a	 ha 	 s 	 	 surpass 	 ed 	 	country	b	with	$	700	per	capita	gdp	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	$	650	per	capita	gdp	.
both	 count 	 ries 	 	are	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	ask	you	,	``	which	are	the	two	asian	 count 	 ries 	 	?
and	which	one	is	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	?	``
you	may	 argu 	 e 	 	,	``	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	country	a	is	 chin 	 a 	 	and	country	b	is	india	.	``
in	fact	,	country	a	is	 democrat 	 ic 	 	india	,	and	country	b	is	pakistan	--	the	country	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	long	period	of	 militar 	 y 	 	rule	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	common	that	we	 compar 	 e 	 	india	with	 chin 	 a 	 	.
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	two	 count 	 ries 	 	have	about	the	same	population	 s 	 ize 	 	.
but	the	more	natural	 compar 	 ison 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	between	india	and	pakistan	.
 t 	 hose 	 	two	 count 	 ries 	 	are	 geo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	similar	.
they	have	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	but	 share 	 d 	 	common	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
by	that	 compar 	 ison 	 	,	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	economic	growth	.
so	why	do	 economist 	 s 	 	fall	in	love	with	 author 	 itarian 	 	 government 	 s 	 	?
one	reason	is	the	east	asian	model	.
in	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	we	have	had	 success 	 ful 	 	economic	growth	 st 	 ories 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	korea	,	taiwan	,	hong	kong	and	singapore	.
some	of	these	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 rul 	 ed 	 	by	 author 	 itarian 	 	 government 	 s 	 	in	the	60s	and	70s	and	1980s	.
the	problem	with	that	view	is	like	 ask 	 ing 	 	all	the	 winner 	 s 	 	of	 lot 	 ter 	 ies 	 	,	``	have	you	won	the	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	?	``
and	they	all	tell	you	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	have	won	the	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	.	``
and	then	you	draw	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	the	 odd 	 s 	 	of	winning	the	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	are	100	percent	.
the	reason	is	you	never	go	and	 both 	 er 	 	to	ask	the	 lose 	 rs 	 	who	 al 	 so 	 	 purchase 	 d 	 	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	 ticket 	 s 	 	and	did	n't	end	up	winning	the	prize	.
for	each	of	these	 success 	 ful 	 	 author 	 itarian 	 	 government 	 s 	 	in	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	there	's	a	 match 	 ed 	 	failure	.
korea	 succeed 	 ed 	 	,	north	korea	did	n't	.
taiwan	 succeed 	 ed 	 	,	 chin 	 a 	 	under	mao	zedong	did	n't	.
burma	did	n't	succeed	.
the	philippines	did	n't	succeed	.
if	you	look	at	the	 statistic 	 al 	 	evidence	 world 	 wide 	 	,	there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	no	support	for	the	idea	that	 author 	 itarian 	 	 government 	 s 	 	hold	a	 system 	 atic 	 	edge	over	 demo 	 cracies 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	economic	growth	.
so	the	east	asian	model	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	massive	 s 	 election 	 	bias	--	it	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	 select 	 ing 	 	on	a	dependent	 vari 	 able 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	 al 	 ways 	 	tell	our	 student 	 s 	 	to	avoid	.
so	 exact 	 ly 	 	why	did	 chin 	 a 	 	grow	so	much	 fast 	 er 	 	?
i	will	take	you	to	the	cultural	revolution	,	when	 chin 	 a 	 	went	mad	,	and	 compar 	 e 	 	that	country	's	performance	with	india	under	indira	gandhi	.
the	question	there	is	:	which	country	did	better	,	 chin 	 a 	 	or	india	?
 chin 	 a 	 	was	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	cultural	revolution	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	even	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	cultural	revolution	,	 chin 	 a 	 	out	-	perfomed	india	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	gdp	growth	by	an	average	of	about	2.2	percent	every	year	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	per	capita	gdp	.
so	that	's	when	 chin 	 a 	 	was	mad	.
the	whole	country	went	mad	.
it	must	mean	that	the	country	had	 some 	 thing 	 	so	 advantage 	 ous 	 	to	 it 	 self 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	economic	growth	to	 over 	 come 	 	the	negative	 effect 	 s 	 	of	the	cultural	revolution	.
the	advantage	the	country	had	was	human	capital	--	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	but	human	capital	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	 develop 	 ment 	 	index	 indic 	 ator 	 	data	in	the	early	1990s	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	data	that	i	can	find	.
the	adult	 liter 	 acy 	 	rate	in	 chin 	 a 	 	is	77	percent	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	48	percent	in	india	.
the	contrast	in	 liter 	 acy 	 	rates	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	sharp	between	chinese	women	and	indian	women	.
i	have	n't	told	you	about	the	definition	of	 liter 	 acy 	 	.
in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	the	definition	of	 liter 	 acy 	 	is	the	ability	to	read	and	write	1,500	chinese	 character 	 s 	 	.
in	india	,	the	definition	of	 liter 	 acy 	 	,	 oper 	 ating 	 	definition	of	 liter 	 acy 	 	,	is	the	ability	,	the	grand	ability	,	to	write	your	own	name	in	 what 	 ever 	 	language	you	happen	to	speak	.
the	gap	between	the	two	 count 	 ries 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 liter 	 acy 	 	is	much	more	 sub 	 stantial 	 	than	the	data	here	 indic 	 ated 	 	.
if	you	go	to	other	 source 	 s 	 	of	data	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	human	 develop 	 ment 	 	index	,	that	data	 s 	 eries 	 	,	go	back	to	the	early	1970s	,	you	see	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	contrast	.
 chin 	 a 	 	held	a	huge	advantage	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	human	capital	vis	-	a	-	vis	india	.
life	 expect 	 ancies 	 	:	 a 	 s 	 	early	 a 	 s 	 	1965	,	 chin 	 a 	 	had	a	huge	advantage	in	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	.
on	average	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	chinese	in	1965	,	you	lived	10	 year 	 s 	 	more	than	an	average	indian	.
so	if	you	have	a	choice	between	 be 	 ing 	 	a	chinese	and	 be 	 ing 	 	an	indian	,	you	would	want	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	chinese	in	order	to	live	10	 year 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	.
if	you	made	that	decision	in	1965	,	the	down	side	of	that	is	the	next	year	we	have	the	cultural	revolution	.
so	you	have	to	 al 	 ways 	 	think	 care 	 fully 	 	about	these	 decision 	 s 	 	.
if	you	can	not	chose	your	 national 	 ity 	 	,	then	you	will	want	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	indian	man	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	indian	man	,	you	have	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	advantage	vis	-	a	-	vis	indian	women	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	strange	fact	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	among	 count 	 ries 	 	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	pattern	.
it	 show 	 s 	 	the	 system 	 atic 	 	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	and	 bias 	 es 	 	in	the	indian	 socie 	 ty 	 	against	women	.
the	good	news	is	,	by	2006	,	india	 ha 	 s 	 	closed	the	gap	between	men	and	women	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	indian	women	have	a	 s 	 izable 	 	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	edge	over	indian	men	.
so	india	is	 re 	 vert 	 ing 	 	to	the	normal	.
but	india	still	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	work	to	do	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	gender	 e 	 quality 	 	.
these	are	the	two	 picture 	 s 	 	taken	of	 gar 	 ment 	 	 factor 	 ies 	 	in	guangdong	 pro 	 vince 	 	and	 gar 	 ment 	 	 factor 	 ies 	 	in	india	.
in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	it	's	all	women	.
60	to	80	percent	of	the	 work 	 force 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	is	women	in	the	 coast 	 al 	 	part	of	the	country	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	in	india	,	it	's	all	men	.
financial	 time 	 s 	 	 print 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	picture	of	an	indian	 text 	 ile 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	with	the	title	,	``	india	 poise 	 d 	 	to	 over 	 take 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	in	 text 	 ile 	 	.	``
by	looking	at	these	two	 picture 	 s 	 	,	i	say	no	,	it	wo	n't	 over 	 take 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	for	a	while	.
if	you	look	at	other	east	asian	 count 	 ries 	 	,	women	there	play	a	 huge 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	role	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	economic	take	-	off	--	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	creating	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	miracle	 associate 	 d 	 	with	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
india	still	 ha 	 s 	 	a	long	way	to	go	to	catch	up	with	 chin 	 a 	 	.
then	the	issue	is	,	what	about	the	chinese	 politic 	 al 	 	system	?
you	talk	about	human	capital	,	you	talk	about	education	and	public	health	.
what	about	the	 politic 	 al 	 	system	?
is	n't	it	true	that	the	one	-	party	 politic 	 al 	 	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 facilitate 	 d 	 	economic	growth	in	 chin 	 a 	 	?
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	answer	is	more	 nuance 	 d 	 	and	subtle	than	that	.
it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	a	 distinct 	 ion 	 	that	you	draw	between	 static 	 s 	 	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	system	and	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	system	.
statically	,	 chin 	 a 	 	is	a	one	-	party	system	,	 author 	 itarian 	 	--	there	's	no	question	about	it	.
 dynamic 	 ally 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	over	time	to	 be 	 come 	 	less	 author 	 itarian 	 	and	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	.
when	you	explain	change	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	economic	growth	;	economic	growth	is	about	change	--	when	you	explain	change	,	you	use	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	 change 	 d 	 	to	explain	change	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	using	the	constant	to	explain	change	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	effect	can	explain	change	,	but	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	effect	 on 	 ly 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	change	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 change 	 s 	 	,	they	have	 introduc 	 ed 	 	village	 election 	 s 	 	.
they	have	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	the	security	of	 proprietor 	 s 	 	.
and	they	have	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	the	security	with	long	-	term	land	 lease 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 al 	 so 	 	financial	 reform 	 s 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	.
there	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	 r 	 ural 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	revolution	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
to	me	,	the	pace	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 change 	 s 	 	is	too	 s 	 low 	 	,	too	 gradu 	 al 	 	.
and	my	own	view	is	the	country	is	going	to	face	some	 sub 	 stantial 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	not	 move 	 d 	 	further	and	 fast 	 er 	 	on	 politic 	 al 	 	 reform 	 s 	 	.
but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	the	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	in	a	more	liberal	direction	,	 move 	 d 	 	in	a	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	direction	.
you	can	 app 	 ly 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	dynamic	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	india	.
in	fact	,	when	india	was	growing	at	a	hindu	rate	of	growth	--	about	one	percent	,	two	percent	a	year	--	that	was	when	india	was	 l 	 east 	 	 democrat 	 ic 	 	.
indira	gandhi	 declare 	 d 	 	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	rule	in	1975	.
the	indian	government	owned	and	 oper 	 ated 	 	all	the	tv	 station 	 s 	 	.
a	little	-	known	fact	about	india	in	the	1990s	is	that	the	country	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 under 	 taken 	 	economic	 reform 	 s 	 	,	the	country	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 under 	 taken 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 reform 	 s 	 	by	 introduc 	 ing 	 	village	self	-	rule	,	 privat 	 ization 	 	of	media	and	 introduc 	 ing 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	of	information	 act 	 s 	 	.
so	the	dynamic	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	both	with	 chin 	 a 	 	and	in	india	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	direction	.
why	do	 man 	 y 	 	people	 believ 	 e 	 	that	india	is	still	a	growth	disaster	?
one	reason	is	they	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 compar 	 ing 	 	india	with	 chin 	 a 	 	.
but	 chin 	 a 	 	is	a	 super 	 star 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	economic	growth	.
if	you	are	a	nba	player	and	you	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	michael	jordan	,	you	're	going	to	look	not	so	 impress 	 ive 	 	.
but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	you	're	a	bad	 basket 	 ball 	 	player	.
 compar 	 ing 	 	with	a	 super 	 star 	 	is	the	wrong	 bench 	 mark 	 	.
in	fact	,	if	you	 compar 	 e 	 	india	with	the	average	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	,	even	before	the	more	 re 	 cent 	 	period	of	 accele 	 ration 	 	of	indian	growth	--	now	india	is	growing	between	eight	and	nine	percent	--	even	before	 th 	 is 	 	period	,	india	was	 rank 	 ed 	 	fourth	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	economic	growth	among	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	record	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
let	's	think	about	the	future	:	the	dragon	vis	-	a	-	vis	the	elephant	.
which	country	 ha 	 s 	 	the	growth	 moment 	 um 	 	?
 chin 	 a 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	still	 ha 	 s 	 	some	of	the	 excel 	 lent 	 	raw	 fundamental 	 s 	 	--	 most 	 ly 	 	the	social	capital	,	the	public	health	,	the	sense	of	 egalitarian 	 ism 	 	that	you	do	n't	find	in	india	.
but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	india	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 moment 	 um 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 improv 	 ing 	 	 fundamental 	 s 	 	.
the	government	 ha 	 s 	 	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	 bas 	 ic 	 	education	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	 bas 	 ic 	 	health	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	the	government	should	do	more	,	but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	the	direction	it	is	moving	in	is	the	right	direction	.
india	 ha 	 s 	 	the	right	 institution 	 al 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	for	economic	growth	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	is	still	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	 politic 	 al 	 	 reform 	 s 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 reform 	 s 	 	are	a	must	for	 chin 	 a 	 	to	maintain	 it 	 s 	 	growth	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	have	 politic 	 al 	 	 reform 	 s 	 	,	to	have	 wide 	 ly 	 	 share 	 d 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	economic	growth	.
i	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	that	's	going	to	happen	or	not	,	but	i	'm	an	optimist	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	i	'm	going	to	report	to	tedglobal	that	 politic 	 al 	 	 reform 	 s 	 	will	happen	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
