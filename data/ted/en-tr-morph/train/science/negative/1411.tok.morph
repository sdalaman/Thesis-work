you	know	,	cadaver	 dis 	 section 	 	is	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	way	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	human	anatomy	.
for	 student 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	an	experience	,	but	for	a	school	,	it	could	be	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	or	expensive	to	maintain	.
so	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 an 	 atomic 	 	 class 	 es 	 	taught	,	they	do	not	have	a	cadaver	 dis 	 section 	 	lab	.
 may 	 be 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	or	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	where	you	are	,	 cadaver 	 s 	 	may	not	be	 eas 	 ily 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
so	to	address	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	with	a	dr.	 brow 	 n 	 	in	stanford	:	virtual	 dis 	 section 	 	table	.
so	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	anatomage	table	.
so	with	 th 	 is 	 	anatomage	table	,	 student 	 s 	 	can	experience	the	 dis 	 section 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	human	cadaver	.
and	the	table	form	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	since	it	's	touch	-	 inter 	 active 	 	,	just	like	the	way	they	do	 dissect 	 ions 	 	in	the	lab	,	or	 further 	 more 	 	just	the	way	a	surgeon	 oper 	 ates 	 	on	a	patient	you	can	 liter 	 ally 	 	interact	with	your	table	.
our	digital	body	is	one	-	to	-	one	life	 s 	 ize 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	way	 student 	 s 	 	will	see	the	real	anatomy	.
i	'm	going	to	do	some	 demonst 	 ration 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	i	use	my	finger	to	interact	with	my	digital	body	.
i	'm	going	to	do	some	 cut 	 s 	 	.
i	can	cut	any	way	i	want	to	,	so	i	cut	right	here	.
then	it	's	going	to	show	 in 	 side 	 	.
and	i	can	change	my	cut	to	see	different	 part 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	can	cut	there	,	see	the	brain	,	and	i	can	change	my	cut	.
you	can	see	some	internal	 organ 	 s 	 	.
so	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	the	 slice 	 r 	 	mode	.
ok	,	i	'm	going	to	do	 an 	 other 	 	cut	.
right	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	internal	 structure 	 s 	 	.
so	if	i	want	to	see	the	back	side	,	i	can	flip	and	see	from	 be 	 hind 	 	.
like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	if	these	 image 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	to	you	or	 disturb 	 ing 	 	to	you	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	did	the	right	job	.
so	our	 doctor 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	these	are	eye	 can 	 dies 	 	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 butcher 	 ing 	 	the	body	,	i	'd	like	to	do	more	 clinic 	 ally 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 dissect 	 ions 	 	.
what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	i	'm	going	to	peel	off	all	the	skin	,	 muscle 	 s 	 	and	 bone 	 s 	 	,	just	to	see	a	few	internal	 organ 	 s 	 	.
right	here	.
let	's	say	i	'm	going	to	cut	the	liver	right	here	.
ok	.
let	's	say	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	looking	at	the	heart	.
i	'm	going	to	do	some	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	here	.
i	'm	going	to	cut	some	 vein 	 s 	 	,	 arteri 	 es 	 	.
 oop 	 s 	 	!	...
you	do	n't	want	to	hear	``	 oop 	 s 	 	``	in	real	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
but	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	our	digital	man	 ha 	 s 	 	``	 un 	 do 	 	.	``
ok	.
all	right	then	.
let	me	zoom	in	.
i	'm	going	to	make	a	cut	right	there	.
and	then	you	can	see	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	heart	.
you	can	see	the	 at 	 rium 	 	and	the	 ventricle 	 s 	 	,	how	blood	 flow 	 s 	 	to	our	 arteri 	 es 	 	and	 vein 	 s 	 	.
just	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 student 	 s 	 	can	isolate	 any 	 body 	 	and	dissect	any	way	you	want	to	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 al 	 ways 	 	 dis 	 section 	 	.
since	it	's	digital	,	we	can	do	reverse	 dis 	 section 	 	.
so	let	me	show	you	,	i	'm	going	to	start	with	the	skeletal	structure	,	and	i	can	add	a	few	internal	 organ 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 ep 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	can	add	 quick 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
and	i	can	build	 muscle 	 s 	 	 gradu 	 ally 	 	,	just	like	that	.
we	can	see	 tend 	 on 	 s 	 	and	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
wish	i	could	build	my	muscle	 th 	 is 	 	fast	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	way	to	learn	anatomy	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	i	can	show	you	is	,	more	often	than	not	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	get	to	meet	 patient 	 s 	 	in	x	-	ray	form	.
so	,	anatomage	table	 show 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	the	anatomy	will	appear	in	x	-	ray	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	interact	with	your	x	-	ray	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	if	you	want	,	you	can	 compar 	 e 	 	with	how	anatomy	would	appear	in	x	-	ray	,	too	.
so	when	you	are	 d 	 one 	 	,	just	 br 	 ing 	 	back	the	body	and	then	it	's	ready	for	 an 	 other 	 	session	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	our	table	 al 	 so 	 	can	transform	gender	,	too	.
it	's	a	female	now	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	anatomage	table	.	thank	you	.
