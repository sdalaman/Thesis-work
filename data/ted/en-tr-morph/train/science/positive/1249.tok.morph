why	ca	n't	we	solve	these	 problem 	 s 	 	?
we	know	what	they	are	.
 some 	 thing 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	stop	us	.
why	?
i	remember	march	the	15th	,	2000	.
the	b	15	 ice 	 berg 	 	broke	off	the	ross	ice	shelf	.
in	the	 news 	 paper 	 	it	 s 	 aid 	 	``	it	was	all	part	of	a	normal	process	.	``
a	little	bit	further	on	in	the	article	it	 s 	 aid 	 	``	a	loss	that	would	 normal 	 ly 	 	take	the	ice	shelf	50-100	 year 	 s 	 	to	replace	.	``
that	same	word	,	``	normal	,	``	had	two	different	,	 al 	 most 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 meaning 	 s 	 	.
if	we	walk	 in 	 to 	 	the	b	15	 ice 	 berg 	 	when	we	 leav 	 e 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	're	going	to	bump	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	a	thousand	feet	tall	,	76	 mile 	 s 	 	long	,	17	 mile 	 s 	 	wide	,	and	it	's	going	to	weigh	two	 giga 	 ton 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	sorry	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	normal	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	yet	i	think	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	us	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	to	look	at	our	world	through	the	lens	of	normal	is	one	of	the	 force 	 s 	 	that	 stop 	 s 	 	us	 develop 	 ing 	 	real	 solution 	 s 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	90	 day 	 s 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	,	 argu 	 ably 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	of	the	last	century	 occur 	 red 	 	.
it	was	the	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	for	the	first	time	of	the	human	genome	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	code	that	's	in	every	single	one	of	our	50	trillion	 cell 	 s 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	who	we	are	and	what	we	are	.
and	if	we	just	take	one	cell	's	worth	of	 th 	 is 	 	code	and	 un 	 wind 	 	it	,	it	's	a	meter	long	,	two	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	thick	.
two	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	is	20	 atom 	 s 	 	in	 thick 	 ness 	 	.
and	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	what	if	the	answer	to	some	of	our	 big 	 gest 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	could	be	found	in	the	 small 	 est 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	,	where	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	what	is	 valu 	 able 	 	and	what	is	 worth 	 less 	 	is	 mere 	 ly 	 	the	 add 	 ition 	 	or	 subtract 	 ion 	 	of	a	few	 atom 	 s 	 	?
and	what	if	we	could	get	exquisite	control	over	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	energy	,	the	electron	?
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	go	around	the	world	 find 	 ing 	 	the	best	and	 bright 	 est 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	i	could	at	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	have	the	chance	to	take	us	there	,	and	we	 form 	 ed 	 	a	company	to	build	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
six	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	a	hundred	and	 eight 	 y 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	,	they	have	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ments 	 	in	the	lab	,	and	i	will	show	you	three	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	we	can	stop	 burn 	 ing 	 	up	our	planet	and	 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	can	generate	all	the	energy	we	need	right	where	we	are	,	 clean 	 ly 	 	,	 safe 	 ly 	 	,	and	 cheap 	 ly 	 	.
think	of	the	space	that	we	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	our	time	.
a	tremendous	amount	of	energy	is	coming	at	us	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
we	like	the	light	that	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	,	but	in	the	middle	of	summer	,	all	that	heat	is	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	keep	cool	.
in	winter	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	heat	up	the	space	that	we	're	in	,	and	all	that	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	out	through	the	window	.
would	n't	it	be	 re 	 ally 	 	great	if	the	window	could	flick	back	the	heat	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	if	we	 need 	 ed 	 	it	or	flick	it	away	before	it	came	in	?
one	of	the	 material 	 s 	 	that	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 remark 	 able 	 	material	,	carbon	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	form	in	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 re 	 action 	 	where	 graph 	 ite 	 	is	 blast 	 ed 	 	by	a	vapor	,	and	when	the	 vapor 	 ized 	 	carbon	 condens 	 es 	 	,	it	 condens 	 es 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	a	different	form	:	 chicken 	 wire 	 	 roll 	 ed 	 	up	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 chicken 	 wire 	 	carbon	,	 call 	 ed 	 	a	carbon	 nano 	 tube 	 	,	is	a	hundred	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	width	of	one	of	your	 hair 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	more	 conduct 	 ive 	 	than	 cop 	 per 	 	.
how	is	that	possible	?
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	 nano 	 scale 	 	is	 thing 	 s 	 	look	and	act	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
you	think	of	carbon	 a 	 s 	 	black	.
carbon	at	the	 nano 	 scale 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	and	 flex 	 ible 	 	.
and	when	it	's	in	 th 	 is 	 	form	,	if	i	combine	it	with	a	polymer	and	 af 	 fix 	 	it	to	your	window	when	it	's	in	 it 	 s 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	state	,	it	will	reflect	away	all	heat	and	light	,	and	when	it	's	in	 it 	 s 	 	 bleach 	 ed 	 	state	it	will	let	all	the	light	and	heat	through	and	any	combination	in	between	.
to	change	 it 	 s 	 	state	,	by	the	way	,	 take 	 s 	 	two	 volt 	 s 	 	from	a	 milli 	 second 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	.
and	once	you	've	 change 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	state	,	it	 stay 	 s 	 	there	 un 	 til 	 	you	change	 it 	 s 	 	state	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	at	university	of	florida	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	told	to	go	down	the	corridor	to	visit	 an 	 other 	 	scientist	,	and	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	.
imagine	if	we	did	n't	have	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	artificial	 light 	 ing 	 	to	get	around	at	night	.
we	'd	have	to	see	at	night	,	right	?
 th 	 is 	 	lets	you	do	it	.
it	's	a	 nano 	 material 	 	,	two	 nano 	 material 	 s 	 	,	a	 detect 	 or 	 	and	an	 image 	 r 	 	.
the	total	width	of	it	is	600	 time 	 s 	 	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	width	of	a	decimal	place	.
and	it	 take 	 s 	 	all	the	 infra 	 red 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	at	night	,	 convert 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	electron	in	the	space	of	two	small	 film 	 s 	 	,	and	is	 enabl 	 ing 	 	you	to	play	an	image	which	you	can	see	through	.
i	'm	going	to	show	to	tedsters	,	the	first	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	.
 first 	 ly 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	.
 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	is	key	.
it	's	a	film	that	you	can	look	through	.
and	then	i	'm	going	to	turn	the	 light 	 s 	 	out	.
and	you	can	see	,	off	a	 tin 	 y 	 	film	,	 in 	 credible 	 	 clar 	 ity 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	 dawn 	 ed 	 	on	us	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	taking	 infra 	 red 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	 wave 	 length 	 s 	 	,	and	 convert 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 electron 	 s 	 	.
what	if	we	 combine 	 d 	 	it	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
 sudden 	 ly 	 	you	've	 convert 	 ed 	 	energy	 in 	 to 	 	an	electron	on	a	plastic	surface	that	you	can	stick	on	your	window	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	it	can	be	on	any	surface	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
the	power	plant	of	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	is	no	power	plant	.
we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	generating	and	using	.
we	want	to	talk	about	storing	energy	,	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	the	best	thing	we	've	got	going	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	france	a	hundred	and	fifty	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	lead	acid	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	what	's	 store 	 d 	 	,	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	the	best	.
 know 	 ing 	 	that	we	're	not	going	to	put	fifty	of	these	in	our	 base 	 ments 	 	to	store	our	power	,	we	went	to	a	group	at	university	of	texas	at	dallas	,	and	we	 g 	 ave 	 	them	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
it	was	in	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 din 	 er 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	dallas	/	fort	worth	 air 	 port 	 	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	could	you	build	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	these	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 laugh 	 ing 	 	at	us	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.	``
and	what	they	built	was	ebox	.
ebox	is	 test 	 ing 	 	new	 nano 	 material 	 s 	 	to	park	an	electron	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	hold	it	 un 	 til 	 	you	need	it	,	and	then	be	able	to	 re 	 lease 	 	it	and	pass	it	off	.
 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	do	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	can	generate	energy	 clean 	 ly 	 	,	 efficient 	 ly 	 	and	 cheap 	 ly 	 	right	where	i	am	.
it	's	my	energy	.
and	if	i	do	n't	need	it	,	i	can	convert	it	back	up	on	the	window	to	energy	,	light	,	and	beam	it	,	line	of	 s 	 ite 	 	,	to	your	place	.
and	for	that	i	do	not	need	an	electric	grid	between	us	.
the	grid	of	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	is	no	grid	,	and	energy	,	clean	efficient	energy	,	will	one	day	be	free	.
if	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	get	the	last	 puzzl 	 e 	 	piece	,	which	is	water	.
each	of	us	,	every	day	,	need	just	eight	 glass 	 es 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	human	.
when	we	run	out	of	water	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	in	some	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	and	soon	to	be	in	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	from	the	sea	,	and	that	's	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	us	to	build	 de 	 s 	 al 	 in 	 ation 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	.
19	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	is	what	we	're	going	to	have	to	 s 	 pend 	 	.
these	 al 	 so 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	tremendous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	energy	.
in	fact	,	it	's	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	twice	the	world	's	supply	of	oil	to	run	the	 pump 	 s 	 	to	generate	the	water	.
we	're	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	going	to	do	that	.
but	in	a	world	where	energy	is	 free 	 d 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	and	 cheap 	 ly 	 	,	we	can	take	any	water	 where 	 ver 	 	we	are	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	we	need	.
i	'm	glad	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	and	kind	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	no	 kind 	 er 	 	than	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	in	the	world	,	but	they	have	a	magic	look	at	the	world	.
and	i	'm	glad	to	see	 the 	 ir 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	coming	out	of	the	lab	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	long	time	in	coming	for	me	.
18	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	saw	a	photograph	in	the	paper	.
it	was	taken	by	kevin	carter	who	went	to	the	sudan	to	document	 the 	 ir 	 	famine	there	.
i	've	carried	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	with	me	every	day	since	then	.
it	's	a	picture	of	a	little	girl	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	thirst	.
by	any	standard	 th 	 is 	 	is	wrong	.
it	's	just	wrong	.
we	can	do	better	than	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	should	do	better	than	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 when 	 ever 	 	i	go	round	to	 some 	 body 	 	who	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	know	what	,	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	too	difficult	.
it	'll	never	happen	.	you	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	money	.
you	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	time	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	much	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	around	the	corner	,	``	i	say	,	``	try	 say 	 ing 	 	that	to	her	.	``
that	's	what	i	say	in	my	mind	.	and	i	just	say	``	thank	you	,	``	and	i	go	on	to	the	next	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	we	have	to	solve	our	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	i	know	the	answer	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	is	to	be	able	to	get	exquisite	control	over	a	building	block	of	nature	,	the	stuff	of	life	:	the	simple	electron	.
thank	you	.
