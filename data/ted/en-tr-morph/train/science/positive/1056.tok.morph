i	am	 honor 	 ed 	 	to	be	here	,	and	i	'm	 honor 	 ed 	 	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	,	which	i	think	is	of	grave	 import 	 ance 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	a	lot	about	the	 horr 	 ific 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	of	plastic	on	the	planet	and	on	other	species	,	but	plastic	 hurt 	 s 	 	people	too	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	poor	people	.
and	both	in	the	production	of	plastic	,	the	use	of	plastic	and	the	 dispos 	 al 	 	of	plastic	,	the	people	who	have	the	bull	's	-	eye	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 fore 	 head 	 s 	 	are	poor	people	.
people	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	when	the	bp	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	for	 ver 	 y 	 	good	reason	.
people	thought	about	,	``	oh	,	my	god	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	oil	--	it	's	in	the	water	.
it	's	going	to	destroy	the	living	 system 	 s 	 	there	.
people	are	going	to	be	hurt	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	,	that	the	oil	is	going	to	hurt	the	people	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	.	``
what	people	do	n't	think	about	is	:	what	if	the	oil	had	made	it	 safe 	 ly 	 	to	shore	?
what	if	the	oil	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	where	it	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	go	?
not	 on 	 ly 	 	would	it	have	 be 	 en 	 	 burn 	 ed 	 	in	 engine 	 s 	 	and	 add 	 ed 	 	to	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	but	there	's	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	``	cancer	 al 	 ley 	 	,	``	and	the	reason	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	cancer	 al 	 ley 	 	``	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 petro 	 chemical 	 	industry	 take 	 s 	 	that	oil	and	 turn 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	plastic	and	,	in	the	process	,	 kill 	 s 	 	people	.
it	 short 	 en 	 s 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	the	people	who	live	there	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	.
so	oil	and	 petro 	 chemical 	 s 	 	are	not	just	a	problem	where	there	's	a	 s 	 pill 	 	;	they	're	a	problem	where	there	's	not	.
and	what	we	do	n't	often	appreciate	is	the	price	that	poor	people	pay	for	us	to	have	these	 dispos 	 able 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
the	other	thing	that	we	do	n't	often	appreciate	is	it	's	not	just	at	the	point	of	production	that	poor	people	suffer	.
poor	people	 al 	 so 	 	suffer	at	the	point	of	use	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	earn	a	certain	income	level	,	we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	choice	.
the	reason	why	you	want	to	work	hard	and	have	a	job	and	not	be	poor	and	broke	is	so	you	can	have	 choice 	 s 	 	,	economic	 choice 	 s 	 	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	a	chance	to	 choos 	 e 	 	not	to	use	 product 	 s 	 	that	have	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	 poison 	 ous 	 	plastic	in	them	.
other	people	who	are	poor	do	n't	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	.
so	low	-	income	people	often	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	are	 buy 	 ing 	 	the	 product 	 s 	 	that	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	them	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	are	using	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	people	who	wind	up	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ing 	 est 	 ing 	 	a	 dis 	 proportion 	 ate 	 	amount	of	 th 	 is 	 	 poison 	 ous 	 	plastic	and	using	it	.
and	people	say	,	``	well	,	they	should	just	buy	a	different	product	.	``
well	,	the	problem	with	 be 	 ing 	 	poor	is	you	do	n't	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	.
you	often	have	to	buy	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
the	 cheap 	 est 	 	 product 	 s 	 	are	often	the	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
and	if	that	 we 	 re 	 	n't	bad	 en 	 ough 	 	,	if	it	was	n't	just	the	production	of	plastic	that	's	giving	people	cancer	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	``	cancer	 al 	 ley 	 	``	and	 short 	 en 	 ing 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	 hurt 	 ing 	 	poor	 kid 	 s 	 	at	the	point	of	use	,	at	the	point	of	 dispos 	 al 	 	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	poor	people	who	bear	the	burden	.
often	,	we	think	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	good	thing	.
you	're	in	your	 off 	 ice 	 	,	and	you	're	 drink 	 ing 	 	your	 bottle 	 d 	 	water	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	and	you	think	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	throw	 th 	 is 	 	away	.
no	,	i	'm	going	to	be	virtuous	.
i	'm	going	to	put	it	in	the	blue	bin	.	``
you	think	,	``	i	put	mine	in	the	blue	bin	,	``	and	then	you	look	at	your	 col 	 league 	 	and	say	,	``	why	,	you	 cre 	 tin 	 	.
you	put	 your 	 s 	 	in	the	white	bin	.	``
and	we	use	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	moral	tickle	.
we	feel	so	good	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	'll	feel	good	 my 	 self 	 	.
not	you	,	but	i	feel	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
and	so	we	kind	of	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	moral	feel	-	good	moment	.
but	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	be	able	to	follow	that	little	bottle	on	 it 	 s 	 	journey	,	we	would	be	 shock 	 ed 	 	to	discover	that	,	all	too	often	,	that	bottle	is	going	to	be	put	on	a	boat	,	it	's	going	to	go	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	at	some	expense	,	and	it	's	going	to	wind	up	in	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	--	often	 chin 	 a 	 	.
i	think	in	our	 mind 	 s 	 	we	imagine	 some 	 body 	 	's	going	to	take	the	little	bottle	,	say	,	``	oh	,	little	bottle	.
we	're	so	happy	to	see	you	,	little	bottle	.	``
``	you	've	 serv 	 ed 	 	so	well	.	``
he	's	 give 	 n 	 	a	little	bottle	 mass 	 age 	 	,	a	little	bottle	 med 	 al 	 	.
and	say	,	``	what	would	you	like	to	do	next	?	``
the	little	bottle	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	just	do	n't	know	.	``
but	that	's	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
that	bottle	 wind 	 s 	 	up	 get 	 ting 	 	 burn 	 ed 	 	.
 recycl 	 ing 	 	of	plastic	in	 man 	 y 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	the	 inciner 	 ation 	 	of	the	plastic	,	the	 burn 	 ing 	 	of	the	plastic	,	which	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	toxic	 chemical 	 s 	 	and	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 kill 	 s 	 	people	.
and	so	poor	people	who	are	making	these	 product 	 s 	 	in	 petro 	 chemical 	 	 center 	 s 	 	like	``	cancer	 al 	 ley 	 	,	``	poor	people	who	are	 consum 	 ing 	 	these	 product 	 s 	 	 dis 	 proportion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	,	and	then	poor	people	,	who	even	at	the	tail	end	of	the	 recycl 	 ing 	 	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 short 	 ened 	 	,	are	all	 be 	 ing 	 	 harm 	 ed 	 	 great 	 ly 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 addict 	 ion 	 	that	we	have	to	 dispos 	 ability 	 	.
now	you	think	to	 your 	 self 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	how	you	are	--	you	say	,	``	that	 s 	 ure 	 	is	 terr 	 ible 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	poor	people	.
it	's	just	awful	,	 t 	 hose 	 	poor	people	.
i	hope	 some 	 one 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	help	them	.	``
but	what	we	do	n't	understand	is	--	is	,	here	we	are	in	los	angeles	.
we	 work 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	get	the	smog	 r 	 eduction 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	in	los	angeles	.
but	guess	what	?
 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	so	much	 dirt 	 y 	 	production	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 law 	 s 	 	do	n't	protect	the	people	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	now	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	the	clean	air	 gain 	 s 	 	and	the	toxic	air	 gain 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 achiev 	 ed 	 	here	in	california	have	 be 	 en 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	by	 dirt 	 y 	 	air	coming	over	from	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
so	,	we	all	are	 be 	 ing 	 	hit	.	we	all	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 impact 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	just	the	poor	people	get	hit	first	and	worst	.
but	the	 dirt 	 y 	 	production	,	the	 burn 	 ing 	 	of	 toxin 	 s 	 	,	the	lack	of	 environment 	 al 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	creating	so	much	 dirt 	 y 	 	air	 poll 	 ution 	 	it	's	coming	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 era 	 s 	 ed 	 	our	 gain 	 s 	 	here	in	california	.
we	're	back	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	1970s	.
and	so	we	're	on	one	planet	,	and	we	have	to	be	able	to	get	to	the	root	of	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
well	the	root	of	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	in	my	view	,	is	the	idea	of	 dispos 	 ability 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
you	see	,	if	you	understand	the	link	between	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	poison	and	pollute	the	planet	and	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	poor	people	,	you	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 trou 	 bling 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	,	 in 	 sight 	 	:	in	order	to	trash	the	planet	,	you	have	to	trash	people	.
but	if	you	create	a	world	where	you	do	n't	trash	people	,	you	ca	n't	trash	the	planet	.
so	now	we	are	at	a	moment	where	the	coming	together	of	social	justice	 a 	 s 	 	an	idea	and	 eco 	 logy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	idea	,	we	 final 	 ly 	 	can	now	see	that	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	one	idea	.
and	it	's	the	idea	that	we	do	n't	have	 dispos 	 able 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	 dispos 	 able 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	 dispos 	 able 	 	species	.
and	we	do	n't	have	 dispos 	 able 	 	people	either	.
we	do	n't	have	a	 throw 	 away 	 	planet	,	and	we	do	n't	have	 throw 	 away 	 	children	--	it	's	all	precious	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	all	begin	to	come	back	to	that	 bas 	 ic 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	new	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	action	begin	to	emerge	.
 bio 	 mimicry 	 	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	an	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	science	,	 wind 	 s 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	social	justice	idea	.
people	who	are	just	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	 bio 	 mimicry 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 respect 	 ing 	 	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	all	species	.
 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	by	the	way	,	 mean 	 s 	 	 respect 	 ing 	 	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	all	people	--	and	we	'll	get	to	that	.
but	 bio 	 mimicry 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 respect 	 ing 	 	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	all	species	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	're	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	clever	species	.
 th 	 is 	 	big	cortex	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	we	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	proud	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	if	we	want	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	hard	,	we	come	up	,	``	i	know	,	i	'm	going	to	make	a	hard	 sub 	 stance 	 	.
i	know	,	i	'm	going	to	get	 vacuum 	 s 	 	and	 furnace 	 s 	 	and	drag	stuff	out	of	the	ground	and	get	 thing 	 s 	 	hot	and	poison	and	pollute	,	but	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	hard	thing	.
i	'm	so	clever	,	``	and	you	look	 be 	 hind 	 	you	,	and	there	's	 destruct 	 ion 	 	all	around	you	.
but	guess	what	?	you	're	so	clever	,	but	you	're	not	 a 	 s 	 	clever	 a 	 s 	 	a	clam	.
a	 clam 	 shell 	 	's	hard	.
there	's	no	 vacuum 	 s 	 	.	there	's	no	big	 furnace 	 s 	 	.
there	's	no	poison	.	there	's	no	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	our	other	species	 ha 	 s 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	a	long	time	ago	how	to	create	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	need	using	 bio 	 logical 	 	 process 	 es 	 	that	nature	 know 	 s 	 	how	to	use	well	.
well	that	 in 	 sight 	 	of	 bio 	 mimicry 	 	,	of	our	 scientist 	 s 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 real 	 izing 	 	that	we	have	 a 	 s 	 	much	to	learn	from	other	species	.
i	do	n't	mean	taking	a	mouse	and	 stick 	 ing 	 	it	with	stuff	.
i	do	n't	mean	looking	at	it	from	that	way	--	 ab 	 using 	 	the	little	species	.
i	mean	 actual 	 ly 	 	 respect 	 ing 	 	them	,	 respect 	 ing 	 	what	they	've	 achiev 	 ed 	 	.
that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 bio 	 mimicry 	 	,	and	that	 open 	 s 	 	the	door	to	zero	waste	production	,	zero	 poll 	 ution 	 	production	--	that	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	enjoy	a	high	quality	of	life	,	a	high	standard	of	living	 with 	 out 	 	 trash 	 ing 	 	the	planet	.
well	that	idea	of	 bio 	 mimicry 	 	,	 respect 	 ing 	 	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	all	species	,	 combine 	 d 	 	with	the	idea	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	social	justice	,	 respect 	 ing 	 	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	the	worth	of	all	people	,	would	give	us	a	different	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
we	would	have	a	different	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
we	would	have	a	green	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	dr.	king	would	be	proud	of	.
that	should	be	the	goal	.
and	the	way	that	we	get	there	is	to	first	of	all	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	the	idea	of	 dispos 	 ability 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 hurt 	 s 	 	the	species	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	but	it	even	 corrupt 	 s 	 	our	own	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
we	're	so	proud	to	live	here	in	california	.
we	just	had	 th 	 is 	 	vote	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	's	like	,	``	well	,	not	in	our	state	.
i	do	n't	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 state 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.	``
just	so	proud	.
and	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'm	proud	,	too	.
 th 	 ough 	 	we	lead	the	world	in	some	of	the	green	stuff	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	lead	the	world	in	some	of	the	gulag	stuff	.
california	 ha 	 s 	 	one	of	the	highest	 incarce 	 ration 	 	rates	of	all	the	50	 state 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	moral	 challeng 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	moment	.
we	are	passionate	about	 rescu 	 ing 	 	some	dead	 material 	 s 	 	from	the	 land 	 fill 	 	,	but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	passionate	about	 rescu 	 ing 	 	living	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	living	people	.
and	i	would	say	that	we	live	in	a	country	--	five	percent	of	the	world	's	population	,	25	percent	of	the	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	25	percent	of	the	world	's	 prisoner 	 s 	 	.
one	out	of	every	four	people	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	is	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	right	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	that	is	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	 dispos 	 ability 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	 move 	 ment 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 broad 	 en 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 constit 	 uency 	 	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	grow	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	reach	out	beyond	our	natural	comfort	zone	,	one	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	to	the	success	of	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	of	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	 thing 	 s 	 	like	plastic	and	 help 	 ing 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	shift	,	is	people	look	at	our	 move 	 ment 	 	with	some	 s 	 us 	 pic 	 ion 	 	.
and	they	ask	a	question	,	and	the	question	is	:	how	can	these	people	be	so	passionate	?
a	poor	person	,	a	low	-	income	person	,	 some 	 body 	 	in	``	cancer	 al 	 ley 	 	,	``	 some 	 body 	 	in	 watt 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 body 	 	in	harlem	,	 some 	 body 	 	on	an	indian	reservation	,	might	say	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	 right 	 fully 	 	so	,	``	how	can	these	people	be	so	passionate	about	making	 s 	 ure 	 	that	a	plastic	bottle	 ha 	 s 	 	a	second	chance	in	life	,	or	an	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	can	 ha 	 s 	 	a	second	chance	,	and	yet	,	when	my	child	 get 	 s 	 	in	trouble	and	 go 	 es 	 	to	 pri 	 son 	 	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	a	second	chance	?	``
how	can	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	be	so	passionate	about	 say 	 ing 	 	we	do	n't	have	 throw 	 away 	 	stuff	,	no	 throw 	 away 	 	dead	 material 	 s 	 	,	and	yet	accept	 throw 	 away 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	 throw 	 away 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	like	``	cancer	 al 	 ley 	 	?	``
and	so	we	now	get	a	chance	to	be	 tru 	 ly 	 	proud	of	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
when	we	take	on	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	that	extra	call	to	reach	out	to	other	 move 	 ments 	 	and	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	inclusive	and	to	grow	,	and	we	can	 final 	 ly 	 	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	dilemma	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	.
most	of	you	are	good	,	 soft 	 hearted 	 	people	.

you	've	got	to	shrink	it	down	and	be	about	one	issue	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	they	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	told	you	,	``	are	you	going	to	hug	a	tree	,	or	are	you	going	to	hug	a	child	?	pick	.
