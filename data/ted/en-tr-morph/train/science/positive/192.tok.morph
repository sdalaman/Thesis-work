you	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 article 	 s 	 	on	climate	change	,	and	here	's	yet	 an 	 other 	 	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	article	,	just	like	every	other	darn	one	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	all	the	same	stuff	 a 	 s 	 	all	the	other	 one 	 s 	 	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	.
it	even	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	amount	of	 head 	 line 	 	 a 	 s 	 	all	the	other	 one 	 s 	 	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	.
what	's	 un 	 usual 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	is	that	it	's	from	1953	.
and	the	reason	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	you	may	have	the	idea	 th 	 is 	 	problem	is	 relat 	 ively 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	.
that	people	have	just	sort	of	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	about	it	,	and	now	with	kyoto	and	the	governator	and	people	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	we	may	be	on	the	road	to	a	solution	.
the	fact	is	--	uh	-	uh	.
we	've	known	about	 th 	 is 	 	problem	for	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	you	count	it	.
we	have	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	 end 	 lessly 	 	over	the	last	decade	or	so	.
and	we	've	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	close	to	zip	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	growth	rate	of	co	2	in	the	atmosphere	.
you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 form 	 s 	 	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	you	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	is	that	the	rate	of	growth	of	our	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	is	 accele 	 rating 	 	.
and	that	it	's	 accele 	 rating 	 	even	 fast 	 er 	 	than	what	we	thought	was	the	worst	case	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	back	.
so	that	red	line	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	a	lot	of	 skeptic 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	the	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	put	in	the	 project 	 ions 	 	to	make	the	 project 	 ions 	 	look	 a 	 s 	 	bad	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	that	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	would	never	grow	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	that	red	line	.
but	in	fact	,	they	're	growing	 fast 	 er 	 	.
here	's	some	data	from	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	10	 day 	 s 	 	ago	,	which	 show 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	's	 minim 	 um 	 	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	sea	ice	,	and	it	's	the	 low 	 est 	 	by	far	.
and	the	rate	at	which	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	sea	ice	is	going	away	is	a	lot	 quick 	 er 	 	than	 model 	 s 	 	.
so	 de 	 spite 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 expert 	 s 	 	like	me	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	the	planet	and	 burn 	 ing 	 	jet	fuel	,	and	 politic 	 ians 	 	 sign 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ies 	 	--	in	fact	,	you	could	 argu 	 e 	 	the	net	effect	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	negative	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	just	 consum 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	jet	fuel	.
no	,	no	!	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	do	to	put	the	 brake 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 in 	 er 	 tial 	 	thing	--	our	big	 eco 	 nomy 	 	--	we	've	 re 	 ally 	 	 hard 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	,	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.	 re 	 ally 	 	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
i	do	n't	want	to	depress	you	too	much	.
the	problem	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	soluble	,	and	even	soluble	in	a	way	that	's	 reason 	 ably 	 	cheap	.
cheap	meaning	sort	of	the	cost	of	the	 militar 	 y 	 	,	not	the	cost	of	medical	care	.
cheap	meaning	a	few	percent	of	gdp	.
no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	scale	.
so	the	problem	is	soluble	,	and	the	way	we	should	go	about	solving	it	is	,	say	,	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 electric 	 ity 	 	production	,	which	 cause 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	43	-	or	-	so	percent	and	 ris 	 ing 	 	of	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
and	we	could	do	that	by	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 sens 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 conserv 	 ation 	 	,	and	wind	power	,	nuclear	power	and	coal	to	co	2	capture	,	which	are	all	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	ready	for	giant	scale	 deploy 	 ment 	 	,	and	work	.
all	we	lack	is	the	action	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	the	money	to	put	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 to 	 	place	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	our	time	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	that	's	not	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 night 	 	.
what	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 night 	 	is	stuff	we	might	do	if	we	did	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	in	the	middle	here	,	which	is	what	you	do	if	you	do	n't	stop	the	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.
and	you	need	to	deal	--	 some 	 how 	 	break	the	link	between	human	 action 	 s 	 	that	change	climate	,	and	the	climate	change	 it 	 self 	 	.	and	that	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	while	we	can	adapt	to	climate	change	--	and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	be	honest	here	,	there	will	be	some	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	climate	change	.
oh	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	think	it	's	bad	.	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	my	whole	life	 work 	 ing 	 	to	stop	it	.
but	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	it	's	 politic 	 ally 	 	hard	is	there	are	 winner 	 s 	 	and	 lose 	 rs 	 	--	not	all	 lose 	 rs 	 	.
but	,	of	course	,	the	natural	world	,	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	time	 ski 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sea	ice	for	 week 	 s 	 	at	a	time	in	the	high	 arc 	 tic 	 	.
they	will	 complete 	 ly 	 	lose	.
and	there	's	no	 adapt 	 ion 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	problem	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	soluble	.
 th 	 is 	 	geo	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	idea	,	in	it	's	 simpl 	 est 	 	form	,	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	.
you	could	put	 sign 	 ed 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	,	say	 sulfur 	 ic 	 	acid	 particle 	 s 	 	--	 s 	 ul 	 fate 	 s 	 	--	 in 	 to 	 	the	upper	atmosphere	,	the	 strato 	 sphere 	 	,	where	they	'd	reflect	away	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	and	cool	the	planet	.
and	i	know	for	certain	that	that	will	work	.
not	that	there	are	n't	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	but	i	know	for	certain	it	will	work	.
and	the	reason	is	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	not	by	us	,	not	by	me	,	but	by	nature	.
here	's	mount	pinatubo	in	the	early	'90s	.	that	put	a	whole	bunch	of	sulfur	in	the	 strato 	 sphere 	 	with	a	sort	of	atomic	bomb	-	like	cloud	.
the	result	of	that	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
after	that	,	and	some	previous	 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	we	have	,	you	see	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 cool 	 ing 	 	of	the	atmosphere	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	lower	bar	is	the	upper	atmosphere	,	the	 strato 	 sphere 	 	,	and	it	 heat 	 s 	 	up	after	these	 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	.
but	you	'll	notice	that	in	the	upper	bar	,	which	is	the	lower	atmosphere	and	the	surface	,	it	 cool 	 s 	 	down	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 shield 	 ed 	 	the	atmosphere	a	little	bit	.
there	's	no	big	 myster 	 y 	 	about	it	.
there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 myster 	 y 	 	in	the	 detail 	 s 	 	,	and	there	's	some	bad	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	like	it	 partial 	 ly 	 	 destroy 	 s 	 	the	 o 	 zone 	 	layer	--	and	i	'll	get	to	that	in	a	minute	.
but	it	 clear 	 ly 	 	 cool 	 s 	 	down	.
and	one	other	thing	:	it	's	fast	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	say	.	so	much	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	ought	to	do	,	like	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	are	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 s 	 low 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	time	to	build	all	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	we	need	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	when	you	cut	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	cut	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	,	the	amount	of	co	2	in	the	air	,	is	the	sum	of	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	over	time	.
so	you	ca	n't	step	on	the	 brake 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
but	if	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	quick	.
and	there	are	 time 	 s 	 	you	might	like	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	quick	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	you	might	wonder	about	is	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
can	you	 sha 	 de 	 	some	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	and	 effective 	 ly 	 	 compens 	 ate 	 	for	the	 add 	 ed 	 	co	2	,	and	produce	a	climate	sort	of	back	to	what	it	was	 original 	 ly 	 	?
and	the	answer	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 y 	 es 	 	.
so	here	are	the	 graph 	 s 	 	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	before	.
that	's	what	the	world	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	under	one	 part 	 icular 	 	climate	model	's	view	,	with	twice	the	amount	of	co	2	in	the	air	.
the	lower	graph	is	with	twice	the	amount	of	co	2	and	1.8	percent	less	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	and	you	're	back	to	the	original	climate	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	graph	from	ken	caldeira	.	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	say	came	,	 be 	 cause 	 	ken	--	at	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	marty	hoffart	was	 al 	 so 	 	at	in	the	mid	-	'90s	--	ken	and	i	stood	up	at	the	back	of	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	geo	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	wo	n't	work	.	``
and	to	the	person	who	was	promoting	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	atmosphere	's	much	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	.	``
 g 	 ave 	 	a	bunch	of	physical	 reason 	 s 	 	why	it	would	n't	do	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 compens 	 ation 	 	.
ken	went	and	ran	his	 model 	 s 	 	,	and	found	that	it	did	.
 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	old	.
that	report	that	 land 	 ed 	 	on	 p 	 resident 	 	johnson	's	desk	when	i	was	two	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	1965	.
that	report	,	in	fact	,	which	had	all	the	modern	climate	science	--	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 do 	 ing 	 	was	geo	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
it	did	n't	even	talk	about	cutting	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	which	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	shift	in	our	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	we	should	n't	cut	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
we	should	,	but	it	made	 exact 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
so	,	in	a	sense	,	there	's	not	much	new	.
the	one	new	thing	is	 th 	 is 	 	essay	.
so	i	should	say	,	i	guess	,	that	since	the	time	of	that	original	 p 	 resident 	 	johnson	report	,	and	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 report 	 s 	 	of	the	u.s.	national	academy	--	1977	,	1982	,	1990	--	people	 al 	 ways 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
not	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 fool 	 proof 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	an	idea	to	think	about	.
but	when	climate	 be 	 came 	 	,	 politic 	 ally 	 	,	a	hot	 top 	 ic 	 	--	if	i	may	make	the	pun	--	in	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	so	un	-	pc	,	we	could	n't	talk	about	it	.
it	just	 s 	 un 	 k 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	surface	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	speak	about	it	.
but	in	the	last	year	,	paul	crutzen	 publish 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	essay	 say 	 ing 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	what	's	all	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	before	:	that	 may 	 be 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 	rate	of	progress	in	solving	 th 	 is 	 	problem	and	the	 un 	 certain 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	,	we	should	think	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	before	.
the	big	deal	was	he	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	have	won	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	for	 o 	 zone 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
and	so	people	took	him	 serious 	 ly 	 	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	we	should	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	there	will	be	some	 o 	 zone 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	he	had	some	 idea 	 s 	 	to	make	them	go	away	.
there	was	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	press	 cover 	 age 	 	,	all	over	the	world	,	going	right	down	to	``	dr.	strangelove	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	the	earth	,	``	from	the	economist	.
and	that	got	me	 think 	 ing 	 	.	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	on	and	off	,	but	not	so	much	 technical 	 ly 	 	.	and	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ly 	 ing 	 	in	bed	 think 	 ing 	 	one	night	.
and	i	thought	about	 th 	 is 	 	child	's	 to 	 y 	 	--	 h 	 ence 	 	,	the	title	of	my	talk	--	and	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	you	could	use	the	same	physics	that	 make 	 s 	 	that	thing	spin	'	round	in	the	child	's	 radio 	 meter 	 	,	to	 levit 	 ate 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	upper	atmosphere	and	make	them	stay	there	.
one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 s 	 ul 	 fate 	 s 	 	is	they	fall	out	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
the	other	problem	is	they	're	right	in	the	 o 	 zone 	 	layer	,	and	i	'd	prefer	them	above	the	 o 	 zone 	 	layer	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	the	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	from	first	 principle 	 s 	 	.	i	was	 stump 	 ed 	 	.
but	then	i	found	out	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 paper 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	that	 address 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	in	the	natural	atmosphere	.
so	it	 seem 	 s 	 	there	are	 al 	 ready 	 	fine	 particle 	 s 	 	that	are	 levit 	 ated 	 	up	to	what	we	call	the	 me 	 so 	 sphere 	 	,	about	100	 kilometer 	 s 	 	up	,	that	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	effect	.
i	'll	tell	you	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	how	the	effect	 work 	 s 	 	.
there	are	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	 complex 	 ities 	 	that	i	'd	love	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	whole	 even 	 ing 	 	on	,	but	i	wo	n't	.
but	let	's	say	you	have	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	hitting	some	particle	and	it	's	 un 	 even 	 ly 	 	heated	.
so	the	side	facing	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	 warm 	 er 	 	;	the	side	away	,	 cool 	 er 	 	.
gas	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	 bounc 	 e 	 	off	the	warm	side	 bounc 	 e 	 	away	with	some	extra	 velo 	 city 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	warm	.
and	so	you	see	a	net	force	away	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 photo 	 ph 	 or 	 etic 	 	force	.
there	are	a	bunch	of	other	 version 	 s 	 	of	it	that	i	and	some	 collabor 	 ators 	 	have	thought	about	how	to	exploit	.
and	of	course	,	we	may	be	wrong	--	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	all	 be 	 en 	 	peer	 review 	 ed 	 	,	we	're	in	the	middle	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	--	but	so	far	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	good	.
but	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	we	could	 achiev 	 e 	 	long	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	--	much	 long 	 er 	 	than	before	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 levit 	 ated 	 	.
we	can	move	 thing 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 strato 	 sphere 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 me 	 so 	 sphere 	 	,	in	principle	solving	the	 o 	 zone 	 	problem	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	there	will	be	other	 problem 	 s 	 	that	arise	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	could	make	the	 particle 	 s 	 	 migr 	 ate 	 	to	over	the	 pole 	 s 	 	,	so	we	could	arrange	the	climate	 engineer 	 ing 	 	so	it	 re 	 ally 	 	focused	on	the	 pole 	 s 	 	.
which	would	have	minimal	bad	 impact 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	planet	,	where	we	live	,	and	do	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	job	of	what	we	might	need	to	do	,	which	is	 cool 	 ing 	 	the	 pole 	 s 	 	in	case	of	planetary	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	,	if	you	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	idea	that	's	 cre 	 pt 	 	up	that	may	be	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	a	 clever 	 er 	 	idea	than	 put 	 ting 	 	 s 	 ul 	 fate 	 s 	 	in	.
 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	is	right	or	some	other	idea	is	right	,	i	think	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	certain	we	will	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	think	of	 clever 	 er 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	than	just	 put 	 ting 	 	sulfur	in	.
that	if	 engineer 	 s 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	how	we	can	affect	the	planet	.
the	one	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	leverage	.
 th 	 is 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	will	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	like	it	or	not	,	give	us	more	and	more	leverage	to	affect	the	planet	,	to	control	the	planet	,	to	give	us	weather	and	climate	control	--	not	 be 	 cause 	 	we	plan	it	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	it	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	science	 deliver 	 s 	 	it	to	us	bit	by	bit	,	with	better	knowledge	of	the	way	the	system	 work 	 s 	 	and	better	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	to	effect	it	.
now	,	suppose	that	space	 alien 	 s 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	they	're	going	to	land	at	the	u.n.	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	down	the	road	here	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	they	'll	pick	a	 smart 	 er 	 	spot	--	but	suppose	they	 arriv 	 e 	 	and	they	give	you	a	box	.
and	the	box	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 knob 	 s 	 	.
one	knob	is	the	knob	for	 controll 	 ing 	 	global	temperature	.
 may 	 be 	 	 an 	 other 	 	knob	is	a	knob	for	 controll 	 ing 	 	co	2	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	.
you	might	imagine	that	we	would	fight	 war 	 s 	 	over	that	box	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	no	way	to	agree	about	where	to	set	the	 knob 	 s 	 	.
we	have	no	global	 govern 	 ance 	 	.
and	different	people	will	have	different	 place 	 s 	 	they	want	it	set	.
now	,	i	do	n't	think	that	's	going	to	happen	.	it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	.
but	we	're	building	that	box	.
the	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	of	the	world	are	building	it	piece	by	piece	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 lab 	 s 	 	.
even	when	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	other	 reason 	 s 	 	.
even	when	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	they	're	just	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	environment	.
they	have	no	interest	in	crazy	 idea 	 s 	 	like	 engineer 	 ing 	 	the	whole	planet	.
they	develop	science	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	 eas 	 ier 	 	and	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	do	.
and	so	i	guess	my	view	on	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	that	i	want	to	do	it	--	i	do	not	--	but	that	we	should	move	 th 	 is 	 	out	of	the	 shadow 	 s 	 	and	talk	about	it	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 soon 	 er 	 	or	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	'll	be	 confront 	 ed 	 	with	 decision 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	it	's	better	if	we	think	hard	about	it	,	even	if	we	want	to	think	hard	about	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	should	never	do	it	.
i	'll	give	you	two	different	ways	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	problem	that	are	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	my	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	to	think	about	it	.
but	what	we	need	is	not	just	a	few	 odd 	 ball 	 s 	 	like	me	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	need	a	 broad 	 er 	 	debate	.
a	debate	that	 involve 	 s 	 	 music 	 ians 	 	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	,	 writer 	 s 	 	,	who	get	 engag 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	question	about	climate	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	think	 serious 	 ly 	 	about	what	 it 	 s 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	are	.
so	here	's	one	way	to	think	about	it	,	which	is	that	we	just	do	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	cutting	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
i	guess	the	thing	i	have	n't	 s 	 aid 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	it	is	 absurd 	 ly 	 	cheap	.
it	's	 conceiv 	 able 	 	that	,	say	,	using	the	 s 	 ul 	 fate 	 s 	 	method	or	 th 	 is 	 	method	i	've	come	up	with	,	you	could	create	an	ice	age	at	a	cost	of	.001	percent	of	gdp	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	.	we	have	a	lot	of	leverage	.
it	's	not	a	good	idea	,	but	it	's	just	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	'll	tell	you	how	big	the	lever	is	:	the	lever	is	that	big	.
and	that	 calcul 	 ation 	 	is	n't	much	in	 disput 	 e 	 	.
you	might	 argu 	 e 	 	about	the	 sanit 	 y 	 	of	it	,	but	the	leverage	is	real	.
so	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	could	deal	with	the	problem	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	 stop 	 ping 	 	 reduc 	 ing 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	and	just	 a 	 s 	 	the	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	go	up	,	we	can	 in 	 crease 	 	the	amount	of	geo	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	 any 	 body 	 	 take 	 s 	 	that	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	under	 th 	 is 	 	scenario	,	we	walk	further	and	further	away	from	the	current	climate	.
we	have	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	other	 problem 	 s 	 	,	like	ocean	 acid 	 ification 	 	that	come	from	co	2	in	the	atmosphere	,	 any 	 way 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	but	 may 	 be 	 	one	or	two	 ver 	 y 	 	odd	 folk 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	suggest	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	here	's	a	case	which	is	 hard 	 er 	 	to	reject	.
let	's	say	that	we	do	n't	do	geo	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	we	do	what	we	ought	to	do	,	which	is	get	serious	about	cutting	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
but	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	we	have	to	cut	them	.
there	's	a	lot	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	about	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	much	climate	change	is	too	much	.
so	let	's	say	that	we	work	hard	,	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	just	tap	the	 brake 	 s 	 	,	but	we	step	hard	on	the	 brake 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	 some 	 day 	 	--	like	2075	,	october	23	--	we	 final 	 ly 	 	reach	that	 glor 	 ious 	 	day	where	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	have	 peak 	 ed 	 	and	are	 roll 	 ing 	 	down	the	other	side	.
and	we	have	global	 celebr 	 ations 	 	,	and	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	--	you	know	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	worst	of	it	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	on	that	day	we	 al 	 so 	 	find	that	the	greenland	ice	sheet	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 melt 	 ing 	 	 un 	 accept 	 ably 	 	fast	,	fast	 en 	 ough 	 	to	put	 meter 	 s 	 	of	sea	level	on	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	in	the	next	100	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 re 	 move 	 	some	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	cities	from	the	map	.
that	's	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	possible	scenario	.
we	might	decide	at	that	point	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	geo	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	was	 un 	 certain 	 	and	 moral 	 ly 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	,	that	it	's	a	lot	better	than	not	geo	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	to	look	at	the	problem	.
it	's	using	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	risk	control	,	not	 in 	 stead 	 	of	action	.
it	's	 say 	 ing 	 	that	you	do	some	geo	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	for	a	little	while	to	take	the	worst	of	the	heat	off	,	not	that	you	'd	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 substitut 	 e 	 	for	action	.
but	there	is	a	problem	with	that	view	.
and	the	problem	is	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	:	knowledge	that	geo	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	is	possible	 make 	 s 	 	the	climate	 impact 	 s 	 	look	less	 fear 	 some 	 	,	and	that	 make 	 s 	 	a	 weak 	 er 	 	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	cutting	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 economist 	 s 	 	call	a	moral	hazard	.
and	that	's	one	of	the	fundamental	 reason 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	problem	is	so	hard	to	talk	about	,	and	,	in	general	,	i	think	it	's	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	reason	that	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 politic 	 ally 	 	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	you	do	n't	make	good	policy	by	 hid 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	 draw 	 er 	 	.
i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	three	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	then	one	final	quote	.
should	we	do	serious	research	on	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	?
should	we	have	a	national	research	program	that	 look 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	?
not	just	at	how	you	would	do	it	better	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	what	all	the	 risk 	 s 	 	and	 down 	 side 	 s 	 	of	it	are	.
right	now	,	you	have	a	few	 enthusiast 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	some	in	a	positive	side	,	some	in	a	negative	side	--	but	that	's	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	state	to	be	in	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	little	depth	of	knowledge	on	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	amount	of	money	would	get	us	some	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	us	--	 may 	 be 	 	now	me	--	think	we	should	do	that	.
but	i	have	a	lot	of	 reservation 	 s 	 	.
my	 reservation 	 s 	 	are	 principal 	 ly 	 	about	the	moral	hazard	problem	,	and	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	how	we	can	best	avoid	the	moral	hazard	.
i	think	there	is	a	serious	problem	:	 a 	 s 	 	you	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	people	begin	to	think	they	do	n't	need	to	work	so	hard	to	cut	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	is	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	need	a	 treat 	 y 	 	.
a	 treat 	 y 	 	that	 decide 	 s 	 	who	 get 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
right	now	we	may	think	of	a	big	,	rich	country	like	the	u.s.	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	it	might	well	be	that	,	in	fact	,	if	 chin 	 a 	 	 wake 	 s 	 	up	in	2030	and	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	the	climate	 impact 	 s 	 	are	just	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	,	they	may	not	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	our	moral	 conversation 	 s 	 	about	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	may	just	decide	they	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	have	a	geo	-	engineered	world	than	a	non	-	geo	-	engineered	world	.
and	we	'll	have	no	 inter 	 national 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	to	figure	out	who	 make 	 s 	 	the	decision	.
so	here	's	one	last	thought	,	which	was	 s 	 aid 	 	much	,	much	better	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	the	u.s.	national	academy	report	than	i	can	say	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	i	think	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 summarize 	 s 	 	where	we	are	here	.
that	the	co	2	problem	,	the	climate	problem	that	we	've	heard	about	,	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 innov 	 ations 	 	in	the	energy	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	will	 reduc 	 e 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	think	,	 inevit 	 ably 	 	,	it	will	drive	us	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	climate	and	weather	control	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	like	it	or	not	.
and	it	's	time	to	begin	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	even	if	the	reason	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	is	to	construct	 argument 	 s 	 	for	why	we	should	n't	do	it	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
