 a 	 s 	 	a	 magic 	 ian 	 	,	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 performance 	 s 	 	that	 in 	 corporate 	 	 element 	 s 	 	of	illusion	.
and	one	of	the	most	 remark 	 able 	 	was	the	 tana 	 gra 	 	theater	,	which	was	popular	in	the	early	part	of	the	20th	century	.
it	used	 mirror 	 s 	 	to	create	the	illusion	of	 tin 	 y 	 	people	 perform 	 ing 	 	on	a	 miniatur 	 e 	 	stage	.	now	,	i	wo	n't	use	 mirror 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	digital	tribute	to	the	 tana 	 gra 	 	theater	.
so	let	the	story	begin	.
on	a	dark	and	 storm 	 y 	 	night	--	 re 	 ally 	 	!	--	it	was	the	10th	of	july	,	1856	.
 light 	 ning 	 	lit	the	sky	,	and	a	baby	was	born	.
his	name	was	nikola	,	nikola	tesla	.
now	the	baby	grew	 in 	 to 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	guy	.
let	me	show	you	.
tesla	,	what	is	236	 multi 	 plied 	 	by	501	?
nikola	tesla	:	the	result	is	118,236	.
marco	tempest	:	now	tesla	's	brain	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	most	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	way	.
when	a	word	was	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	an	image	of	it	 instant 	 ly 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	his	mind	.
tree	.	chair	.	girl	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	which	 vanish 	 ed 	 	the	moment	he	 touch 	 ed 	 	them	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	a	form	of	 synest 	 hesia 	 	.
but	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	he	 lat 	 er 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	his	advantage	.
where	other	 scientist 	 s 	 	would	play	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	tesla	 create 	 d 	 	his	 invent 	 ions 	 	in	his	mind	.
nt	:	to	my	 de 	 light 	 	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	i	could	 visual 	 ize 	 	my	 invent 	 ions 	 	with	the	 great 	 est 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
mt	:	and	when	they	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	 vivi 	 d 	 	 play 	 ground 	 	of	his	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	he	would	build	them	in	his	 work 	 shop 	 	.
nt	:	i	 need 	 ed 	 	no	 model 	 s 	 	,	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	or	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
i	could	picture	them	 a 	 s 	 	real	in	my	mind	,	and	there	i	run	it	,	test	it	and	improve	it	.
 on 	 ly 	 	then	do	i	construct	it	.
mt	:	his	great	idea	was	 alter 	 nating 	 	current	.
but	how	could	he	 con 	 vince 	 	the	public	that	the	 million 	 s 	 	of	 volt 	 s 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	make	it	work	 we 	 re 	 	safe	?
to	sell	his	idea	,	he	 be 	 came 	 	a	 show 	 man 	 	.
nt	:	we	are	at	the	dawn	of	a	new	age	,	the	age	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	,	through	 care 	 ful 	 	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	to	transmit	,	with	the	mere	flick	of	a	 s 	 witch 	 	,	 electric 	 ity 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ether	.
it	is	the	magic	of	science	.
tesla	 ha 	 s 	 	over	700	 patent 	 s 	 	to	his	name	:	radio	,	 wire 	 less 	 	 tele 	 graphy 	 	,	remote	control	,	 robotic 	 s 	 	.
he	even	 photograph 	 ed 	 	the	 bone 	 s 	 	of	the	human	body	.
but	the	high	point	was	the	 real 	 ization 	 	of	a	 child 	 hood 	 	dream	:	 harness 	 ing 	 	the	 rag 	 ing 	 	 power 	 s 	 	of	niagara	 fall 	 s 	 	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	light	to	the	city	.
but	tesla	's	success	did	n't	last	.
nt	:	i	had	 big 	 ger 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 illumi 	 nating 	 	the	city	was	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
a	world	 tele 	 graphy 	 	center	--	imagine	news	,	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	,	 sound 	 s 	 	,	 image 	 s 	 	 deliver 	 ed 	 	to	any	point	in	the	world	 instant 	 ly 	 	and	 wire 	 lessly 	 	.
mt	:	it	's	a	great	idea	;	it	was	a	huge	project	.	expensive	,	too	.
nt	:	they	would	n't	give	me	the	money	.
mt	:	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	should	n't	have	told	them	it	could	be	used	to	contact	other	 planet 	 s 	 	.
nt	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	was	a	big	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
mt	:	tesla	's	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	inventor	never	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
he	 be 	 came 	 	a	 reclus 	 e 	 	.
 dodge 	 d 	 	by	death	,	he	 s 	 pent 	 	much	of	his	time	in	his	 suit 	 e 	 	at	the	waldorf	-	astoria	.
nt	:	 every 	 thing 	 	i	did	,	i	did	for	 man 	 kind 	 	,	for	a	world	where	there	would	be	no	 humil 	 iation 	 	of	the	poor	by	the	violence	of	the	rich	,	where	 product 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	,	science	and	art	will	serve	 socie 	 ty 	 	for	the	 better 	 ment 	 	and	 beaut 	 ification 	 	of	life	.
mt	:	nikola	tesla	 di 	 ed 	 	on	the	7th	of	january	,	1943	.
his	final	 rest 	 ing 	 	place	is	a	 gold 	 en 	 	 glob 	 e 	 	that	 contain 	 s 	 	his	ashes	at	the	nikola	tesla	museum	in	belgrade	.
his	 leg 	 acy 	 	is	with	us	still	.
tesla	 be 	 came 	 	the	man	who	lit	the	world	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
tesla	's	 in 	 sight 	 	was	 pro 	 found 	 	.
nt	:	tell	me	,	what	will	man	do	when	the	 forest 	 s 	 	disappear	,	and	the	coal	 deposit 	 s 	 	are	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	?
mt	:	tesla	thought	he	had	the	answer	.
we	are	still	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	question	.
thank	you	.
