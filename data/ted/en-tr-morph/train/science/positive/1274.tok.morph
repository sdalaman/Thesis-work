have	you	ever	 want 	 ed 	 	to	stay	young	a	little	 long 	 er 	 	and	put	off	aging	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dream	of	the	 age 	 s 	 	.
but	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	for	a	long	time	thought	 th 	 is 	 	just	was	never	going	to	be	possible	.
they	thought	you	just	wear	out	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	you	can	do	about	it	--	kind	of	like	an	old	shoe	.
but	if	you	look	in	nature	,	you	see	that	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	can	have	 re 	 ally 	 	different	 life 	 span 	 s 	 	.
now	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	different	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	different	 gene 	 s 	 	.
so	that	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	 some 	 where 	 	in	these	 gene 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	dna	,	are	 gene 	 s 	 	for	aging	,	 gene 	 s 	 	that	allow	them	to	have	different	 life 	 span 	 s 	 	.
so	if	there	are	 gene 	 s 	 	like	that	,	then	you	can	imagine	that	,	if	you	could	change	one	of	the	 gene 	 s 	 	in	an	experiment	,	an	aging	gene	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	could	 s 	 low 	 	down	aging	and	extend	 life 	 span 	 	.
and	if	you	could	do	that	,	then	you	could	find	the	 gene 	 s 	 	for	aging	.
and	if	they	exist	and	you	can	find	them	,	then	 may 	 be 	 	one	could	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
so	we	've	set	out	to	look	for	 gene 	 s 	 	that	control	aging	.
and	we	did	n't	 stud 	 y 	 	any	of	these	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	a	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	,	round	worm	 call 	 ed 	 	c.	 ele 	 gan 	 s 	 	,	which	is	just	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 com 	 ma 	 	in	a	sentence	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	that	we	could	find	 some 	 thing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	report	of	a	long	-	lived	 mut 	 ant 	 	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	change	 gene 	 s 	 	at	random	,	looking	for	long	-	lived	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	find	that	 mutation 	 s 	 	that	damage	one	single	gene	 call 	 ed 	 	daf	-	2	 double 	 d 	 	the	 life 	 span 	 	of	the	little	worm	.
so	you	can	see	in	black	,	after	a	month	--	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	short	-	lived	;	that	's	why	we	like	to	 stud 	 y 	 	them	for	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	aging	--	in	black	,	after	a	month	,	the	normal	 worm 	 s 	 	are	all	dead	.
but	at	that	time	,	most	of	the	 mut 	 ant 	 	 worm 	 s 	 	are	still	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	it	is	n't	 un 	 til 	 	twice	 a 	 s 	 	long	that	they	're	all	dead	.
and	now	i	want	to	show	what	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	like	in	 th 	 is 	 	movie	here	.
so	the	first	thing	you	're	going	to	see	is	the	normal	worm	when	it	's	about	college	student	age	--	a	young	adult	.
it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	cute	little	fellow	.
and	next	you	're	going	to	see	the	long	-	lived	 mut 	 ant 	 	when	it	's	young	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	animal	is	going	to	live	twice	 a 	 s 	 	long	.
is	it	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	?	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	to	be	.
it	's	active	.	you	ca	n't	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	.
and	they	can	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 fertil 	 e 	 	--	have	the	same	number	of	 pro 	 geny 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	normal	 worm 	 s 	 	do	.
now	get	out	your	 handkerchief 	 s 	 	here	.
you	're	going	to	see	,	in	just	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	the	normal	 worm 	 s 	 	are	old	.
you	can	see	the	little	head	moving	down	at	the	bottom	there	.
but	 every 	 thing 	 	else	is	just	 ly 	 ing 	 	there	.
the	animal	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	in	the	 nurs 	 ing 	 	home	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	 tissue 	 s 	 	of	the	animal	,	they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 deterio 	 rate 	 	.
you	know	,	even	if	you	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	one	of	these	little	c.	 ele 	 gan 	 s 	 	--	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	most	of	you	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	one	--	you	can	tell	they	're	old	--	is	n't	that	 interest 	 ing 	 	?
so	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	about	aging	that	's	kind	of	universal	.
and	now	here	is	the	daf	-	2	 mut 	 ant 	 	.
one	gene	is	 change 	 d 	 	out	of	20,000	,	and	look	at	it	.
it	's	the	same	age	,	but	it	's	not	in	the	 nurs 	 ing 	 	home	;	it	's	going	 ski 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	:	it	's	aging	more	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	worm	two	 day 	 s 	 	to	age	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	normal	worm	 age 	 s 	 	in	one	day	.
and	when	i	tell	people	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	tend	to	think	of	 may 	 be 	 	an	80	or	90	year	-	old	person	who	 look 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	good	for	 be 	 ing 	 	90	or	80	.
but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	let	's	say	you	're	a	30	year	-	old	guy	--	or	in	your	30s	--	and	you	're	a	bachelor	and	you	're	 d 	 ating 	 	people	.
and	you	meet	 some 	 one 	 	you	 re 	 ally 	 	like	,	you	get	to	know	her	.
and	you	're	in	a	restaurant	,	and	you	say	,	``	well	how	old	are	you	?	``
she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	60.	``
that	's	what	it	's	like	.	and	you	would	never	know	.
you	would	never	know	,	 un 	 til 	 	she	told	you	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	what	is	the	daf	-	2	gene	?
well	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	 gene 	 s 	 	,	which	are	part	of	the	dna	,	they	're	 instruct 	 ions 	 	to	make	a	protein	that	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	the	daf	-	2	gene	 encode 	 s 	 	a	hormone	receptor	.
so	what	you	see	in	the	picture	there	is	a	cell	with	a	hormone	receptor	in	red	 punch 	 ing 	 	through	the	edge	of	the	cell	.
so	part	of	it	is	like	a	 base 	 ball 	 	glove	.
part	of	it	's	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	it	's	 catch 	 ing 	 	the	hormone	 a 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	by	in	green	.
and	the	other	part	is	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	where	it	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	cell	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	what	is	the	daf	-	2	receptor	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	cell	?
i	just	told	you	that	,	if	you	make	a	mutation	in	the	daf	-	2	gene	cell	,	that	you	get	a	receptor	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 a 	 s 	 	well	;	the	animal	 live 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	.
so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	normal	function	of	 th 	 is 	 	hormone	receptor	is	to	speed	up	aging	.
that	's	what	that	arrow	 mean 	 s 	 	.
it	 speed 	 s 	 	up	aging	.	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	go	 fast 	 er 	 	.
so	it	's	like	the	animal	 ha 	 s 	 	the	grim	 reap 	 er 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	 it 	 self 	 	,	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	aging	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 together 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	that	aging	is	subject	to	control	by	the	 gene 	 s 	 	,	and	 specific 	 ally 	 	by	 hormone 	 s 	 	.
so	what	kind	of	 hormone 	 s 	 	are	these	?
there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 hormone 	 s 	 	.	there	's	testosterone	,	adrenalin	.
you	know	about	a	lot	of	them	.
these	 hormone 	 s 	 	are	similar	to	 hormone 	 s 	 	that	we	have	in	our	bodies	.
the	daf	-	2	hormone	receptor	is	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	the	receptor	for	the	hormone	insulin	and	igf	-	1	.
now	you	've	all	heard	of	at	 l 	 east 	 	insulin	.
insulin	is	a	hormone	that	 promote 	 s 	 	the	 up 	 take 	 	of	 nutrient 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	 tissue 	 s 	 	after	you	eat	a	meal	.
and	the	hormone	igf	-	1	 promote 	 s 	 	growth	.
so	these	 function 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	known	for	these	 hormone 	 s 	 	for	a	long	time	,	but	our	 stud 	 ies 	 	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	they	had	a	third	function	that	 no 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	about	--	 may 	 be 	 	they	 al 	 so 	 	affect	aging	.
and	it	's	looking	like	that	's	the	case	.
so	after	we	made	our	 discover 	 ies 	 	with	little	c.	 ele 	 gan 	 s 	 	,	people	who	 work 	 ed 	 	on	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	if	we	made	the	same	daf	-	2	mutation	,	the	hormone	receptor	mutation	,	in	other	 animal 	 s 	 	,	will	they	live	 long 	 er 	 	?
and	that	is	the	case	in	flies	.
if	you	change	 th 	 is 	 	hormone	 path 	 way 	 	in	flies	,	they	live	 long 	 er 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	in	 mic 	 e 	 	--	and	 mic 	 e 	 	are	 mammal 	 s 	 	like	us	.
so	it	's	an	ancient	 path 	 way 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	must	have	 arise 	 n 	 	a	long	time	ago	in	evolution	 s 	 uch 	 	that	it	still	 work 	 s 	 	in	all	these	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	common	 pre 	 cursor 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	rise	to	people	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	in	people	the	same	way	.
and	there	are	 hint 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	was	one	 stud 	 y 	 	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	a	population	of	ashkenazi	jews	in	new	york	city	.
and	just	like	any	population	,	most	of	the	people	live	to	be	about	70	or	80	,	but	some	live	to	be	90	or	100	.
and	what	they	found	was	that	people	who	lived	to	90	or	100	 we 	 re 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	daf	-	2	 mutation 	 s 	 	--	that	is	,	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	gene	that	 encode 	 s 	 	the	receptor	for	igf	-	1	.
and	these	 change 	 s 	 	made	the	gene	not	act	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	normal	gene	would	have	 act 	 ed 	 	.
it	 damage 	 d 	 	the	gene	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 hint 	 s 	 	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	 human 	 s 	 	are	susceptible	to	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	the	 hormone 	 s 	 	for	aging	.
so	the	next	question	,	of	course	,	is	:	is	there	any	effect	on	age	-	related	disease	?
 a 	 s 	 	you	age	,	you	're	much	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	get	cancer	,	alzheimer	's	disease	,	heart	disease	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 disease 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	these	long	-	lived	 mut 	 ants 	 	are	more	resistant	to	all	these	 disease 	 s 	 	.
they	 hard 	 ly 	 	get	cancer	,	and	when	they	do	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	severe	.
so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	sense	in	a	way	,	that	they	're	still	young	,	so	why	would	they	be	 get 	 ting 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	of	aging	 un 	 til 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	old	?
so	it	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	,	if	we	could	have	a	therapeutic	or	a	pill	to	take	to	replicate	some	of	these	 effect 	 s 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	would	have	a	way	of	 combat 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	age	-	related	 disease 	 s 	 	all	at	once	.
so	how	can	a	hormone	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	affect	the	rate	of	aging	?
how	could	that	work	?
well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	in	the	daf	-	2	 mut 	 ants 	 	,	a	whole	lot	of	 gene 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	on	in	the	dna	that	encode	 protein 	 s 	 	that	protect	the	 cell 	 s 	 	and	the	 tissue 	 s 	 	,	and	repair	damage	.
and	the	way	that	they	're	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	on	is	by	a	gene	 regulat 	 or 	 	protein	 call 	 ed 	 	foxo	.
so	in	a	daf	-	2	 mut 	 ant 	 	--	you	see	that	i	have	the	x	drawn	here	through	the	receptor	.
the	receptor	is	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
under	 t 	 hose 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	the	foxo	protein	in	blue	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	 in 	 to 	 	the	nucleus	--	that	little	compartment	there	in	the	middle	of	the	cell	--	and	it	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	down	on	a	gene	 bind 	 ing 	 	to	it	.
you	see	one	gene	.	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 gene 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	bind	on	foxo	.
and	it	's	just	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	one	of	them	.
so	foxo	 turn 	 s 	 	on	a	lot	of	 gene 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 gene 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	on	 include 	 s 	 	antioxidant	 gene 	 s 	 	,	 gene 	 s 	 	i	call	carrot	-	giver	 gene 	 s 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	protein	 product 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	help	other	 protein 	 s 	 	to	function	well	--	to	fold	 correct 	 ly 	 	and	function	 correct 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	 es 	 cort 	 	them	to	the	garbage	 can 	 s 	 	of	the	cell	and	 re 	 cycle 	 	them	if	they	're	 damage 	 d 	 	.
dna	repair	 gene 	 s 	 	are	more	active	in	these	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	is	more	active	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	different	 gene 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 show 	 n 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	the	long	 life 	 span 	 	of	the	daf	-	2	 mut 	 ant 	 	.
so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
these	 animal 	 s 	 	have	 with 	 in 	 	them	the	 lat 	 ent 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	live	much	 long 	 er 	 	than	they	 normal 	 ly 	 	do	.
they	have	the	ability	to	protect	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	damage	,	which	we	think	 make 	 s 	 	them	live	 long 	 er 	 	.
so	what	about	the	normal	worm	?
well	when	the	daf	-	2	receptor	is	active	,	then	it	 trigger 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 event 	 s 	 	that	prevent	foxo	from	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	nucleus	where	the	dna	is	.
so	it	ca	n't	turn	the	 gene 	 s 	 	on	.
that	's	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.	that	's	why	we	do	n't	see	the	long	 life 	 span 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	we	have	the	daf	-	2	 mut 	 ant 	 	.
but	what	good	is	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	worm	?
well	we	think	that	insulin	and	igf	-	1	 hormone 	 s 	 	are	 hormone 	 s 	 	that	are	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	active	under	 favor 	 able 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	--	in	the	good	 time 	 s 	 	--	when	food	is	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	and	there	's	not	a	lot	of	stress	in	the	environment	.
then	they	promote	the	 up 	 take 	 	of	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
you	can	store	the	food	,	use	it	for	energy	,	grow	,	etc	.
but	what	we	think	is	that	,	under	 condition 	 s 	 	of	stress	,	the	 level 	 s 	 	of	these	 hormone 	 s 	 	drop	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	food	supply	.
and	that	,	we	think	,	is	 register 	 ed 	 	by	the	animal	 a 	 s 	 	a	danger	signal	,	a	signal	that	 thing 	 s 	 	are	not	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	and	that	it	should	roll	out	 it 	 s 	 	 protect 	 ive 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
so	it	 activate 	 s 	 	foxo	,	foxo	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	dna	,	and	that	 trigger 	 s 	 	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	these	 gene 	 s 	 	that	 improve 	 s 	 	the	ability	of	the	cell	to	protect	 it 	 self 	 	and	repair	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	that	's	why	we	think	the	 animal 	 s 	 	live	 long 	 er 	 	.
so	you	can	think	of	foxo	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	like	a	building	 super 	 intend 	 ent 	 	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	he	's	a	little	bit	 laz 	 y 	 	,	but	he	's	there	,	he	's	taking	care	of	the	building	.
but	it	's	 deterio 	 rating 	 	.
and	then	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	he	 learn 	 s 	 	that	there	's	going	to	be	a	hurricane	.
so	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 any 	 thing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
he	 get 	 s 	 	on	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	--	just	like	foxo	 get 	 s 	 	on	the	dna	--	and	he	 call 	 s 	 	up	the	 roof 	 er 	 	,	the	window	person	,	the	 paint 	 er 	 	,	the	floor	person	.
and	they	all	come	and	they	 fort 	 ify 	 	the	house	.
and	then	the	hurricane	 come 	 s 	 	through	,	and	the	house	is	in	much	better	condition	than	it	would	 normal 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	just	last	 long 	 er 	 	,	even	if	there	is	n't	a	hurricane	.
so	that	's	the	 con 	 cept 	 	here	for	how	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	life	 extens 	 ion 	 	ability	 exist 	 s 	 	.
now	the	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	thing	about	foxo	is	that	there	are	different	 form 	 s 	 	of	it	.
we	all	have	foxo	 gene 	 s 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	all	have	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	form	of	the	foxo	gene	.
just	like	we	all	have	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	some	of	us	have	blue	 eye 	 s 	 	and	some	of	us	have	 brow 	 n 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	there	are	certain	 form 	 s 	 	of	the	foxo	gene	that	have	found	to	be	more	 frequent 	 ly 	 	present	in	people	who	live	to	be	90	or	100	.
and	that	's	the	case	all	over	the	world	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	from	these	 star 	 s 	 	.
and	each	one	of	these	 star 	 s 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	a	population	where	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	are	there	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	the	type	of	foxo	 gene 	 s 	 	among	people	who	live	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	time	?	``	and	there	are	.
we	do	n't	know	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	but	we	do	know	then	that	foxo	 gene 	 s 	 	can	impact	the	 life 	 span 	 	of	people	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	,	 may 	 be 	 	if	we	tweak	it	a	little	bit	,	we	can	 in 	 crease 	 	the	health	and	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	of	people	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
a	foxo	is	a	protein	that	we	found	in	these	little	,	round	 worm 	 s 	 	to	affect	 life 	 span 	 	,	and	here	it	 affect 	 s 	 	 life 	 span 	 	in	people	.
so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	in	our	lab	now	to	develop	 drug 	 s 	 	that	will	activate	 th 	 is 	 	foxo	cell	using	human	 cell 	 s 	 	now	in	order	to	try	and	come	up	with	 drug 	 s 	 	that	will	delay	aging	and	age	-	related	 disease 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	work	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 protein 	 s 	 	that	are	known	to	affect	aging	.
and	for	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	of	them	,	there	is	a	drug	.
there	's	one	 call 	 ed 	 	tor	,	which	is	 an 	 other 	 	nutrient	sensor	,	like	the	insulin	 path 	 way 	 	.
and	 mutation 	 s 	 	that	damage	the	tor	gene	--	just	like	the	daf	-	2	 mutation 	 s 	 	--	extend	 life 	 span 	 	in	 worm 	 s 	 	and	flies	and	 mic 	 e 	 	.
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	there	's	 al 	 ready 	 	a	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	rapamycin	that	 bind 	 s 	 	to	the	tor	protein	and	 inhibit 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	activity	.
and	you	can	take	rapamycin	and	give	it	to	a	mouse	--	even	when	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	old	,	like	age	60	for	a	human	,	that	old	for	a	mouse	--	if	you	give	the	mouse	rapamycin	,	it	will	live	 long 	 er 	 	.
now	i	do	n't	want	you	all	to	go	out	taking	rapamycin	.
it	is	a	drug	for	people	,	but	the	reason	is	it	 suppress 	 es 	 	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
so	people	take	it	to	prevent	organ	 transplant 	 s 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	may	not	be	the	perfect	drug	for	 stay 	 ing 	 	young	 long 	 er 	 	.
but	still	,	here	in	the	year	2011	,	there	's	a	drug	that	you	can	give	to	 mic 	 e 	 	at	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	old	age	that	will	extend	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 span 	 	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	science	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	all	these	different	 animal 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	,	and	i	think	it	wo	n't	be	too	long	,	i	hope	,	before	 th 	 is 	 	age	-	old	dream	 begin 	 s 	 	to	come	true	.
thank	you	.
matt	ridley	:	thank	you	,	cynthia	.
let	me	get	 th 	 is 	 	straight	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	're	looking	for	a	drug	that	can	solve	aging	in	old	men	like	me	,	what	you	could	do	now	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	in	the	lab	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	 ethic 	 ally 	 	,	is	start	a	human	life	from	scratch	with	 alter 	 ed 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	that	would	make	it	live	for	a	lot	 long 	 er 	 	?
ck	:	ah	,	so	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 drug 	 s 	 	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	would	not	change	the	 gene 	 s 	 	,	they	would	just	bind	to	the	protein	 it 	 self 	 	and	change	 it 	 s 	 	activity	.
so	if	you	stop	taking	the	drug	,	the	protein	would	go	back	to	normal	.
you	could	change	the	 gene 	 s 	 	in	principle	.
there	is	n't	the	technology	to	do	that	.
but	i	do	n't	think	that	's	a	good	idea	.
and	the	reason	is	that	these	 hormone 	 s 	 	,	like	the	insulin	and	the	igf	 hormone 	 s 	 	and	the	tor	 path 	 way 	 	,	they	're	essential	.
if	you	knock	them	out	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	then	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	sick	.
so	it	might	be	that	you	would	just	have	to	fine	tune	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	to	get	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	any	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	that	's	much	better	,	that	kind	of	control	would	be	much	better	 a 	 s 	 	a	drug	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	there	are	other	ways	of	 activ 	 ating 	 	foxo	that	do	n't	even	involve	insulin	or	igf	-	1	that	might	even	be	 safe 	 r 	 	.
mr	:	i	was	n't	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	i	was	going	to	go	and	do	it	,	but	...
there	's	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	which	you	have	written	about	and	spoken	about	,	which	is	a	 neglig 	 ible 	 	 s 	 en 	 esc 	 ence 	 	.
there	are	some	 creature 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	 al 	 ready 	 	that	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	do	aging	.
just	move	to	one	side	for	us	,	if	you	would	.
ck	:	there	are	.	there	are	some	 animal 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	seem	to	age	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	are	some	 tortoise 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	blanding	's	 turtle 	 s 	 	.
and	they	grow	to	be	about	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	,	and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	found	to	be	70	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	when	you	look	at	these	70	year	-	old	 turtle 	 s 	 	,	you	ca	n't	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	just	by	looking	,	between	 t 	 hose 	 	 turtle 	 s 	 	and	20	year	-	old	 turtle 	 s 	 	.
and	the	70	year	-	old	 one 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	they	're	better	at	 scout 	 ing 	 	out	the	good	 nest 	 ing 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	have	more	 pro 	 geny 	 	every	year	.
and	there	are	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	like	 turn 	 s 	 	,	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 bird 	 s 	 	are	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	if	they	 re 	 ally 	 	can	live	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	or	what	 keep 	 s 	 	them	from	aging	.
it	's	not	clear	.
if	you	look	at	 bird 	 s 	 	,	which	live	a	long	time	,	 cell 	 s 	 	from	the	 bird 	 s 	 	tend	to	be	more	resistant	to	a	lot	of	different	 environment 	 al 	 	 stress 	 es 	 	like	high	temperature	or	hydrogen	 per 	 oxide 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
and	our	long	-	lived	 mut 	 ants 	 	are	too	.
they	're	more	resistant	to	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 stress 	 es 	 	.
so	it	could	be	that	the	 path 	 ways 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	which	are	set	to	run	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	in	the	worm	,	have	a	different	normal	set	point	in	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	bird	,	so	that	a	bird	can	live	a	lot	 long 	 er 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	they	're	even	set	 re 	 ally 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	in	 animal 	 s 	 	with	no	 s 	 en 	 esc 	 ence 	 	at	all	--	but	we	do	n't	know	.
mr	:	but	what	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	is	not	 extend 	 ing 	 	human	 life 	 span 	 	by	 prevent 	 ing 	 	death	,	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	 extend 	 ing 	 	human	 youth 	 span 	 	.
ck	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	's	right	.
it	's	more	like	,	say	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	dog	.
you	notice	that	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	old	,	and	you	look	at	your	human	and	you	think	,	``	why	is	n't	 th 	 is 	 	human	 get 	 ting 	 	old	?	``
they	're	not	 get 	 ting 	 	old	in	the	dog	's	 life 	 span 	 	.
it	's	more	like	that	.
but	now	we	're	the	human	looking	out	and	 imagin 	 ing 	 	a	different	human	.
mr	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	cynthia	kenyon	.
