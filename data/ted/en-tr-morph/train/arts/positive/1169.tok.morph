i	'm	a	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	artist	with	a	bit	of	an	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	.
i	was	in	my	20s	before	i	ever	went	to	an	art	museum	.
i	grew	up	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	on	a	dirt	road	in	 r 	 ural 	 	arkansas	,	an	hour	from	the	 near 	 est 	 	movie	theater	.
and	i	think	it	was	a	great	place	to	grow	up	 a 	 s 	 	an	artist	 be 	 cause 	 	i	grew	up	around	 quirk 	 y 	 	,	 color 	 ful 	 	 character 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	great	at	making	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	my	 child 	 hood 	 	is	more	hick	than	i	could	ever	possibly	 re 	 late 	 	to	you	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	more	intellectual	than	you	would	ever	expect	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	me	and	my	sister	,	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	little	,	we	would	compete	to	see	who	could	eat	the	most	squirrel	 brain 	 s 	 	.
but	on	the	other	side	of	that	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	big	 read 	 ers 	 	in	our	house	.
and	if	the	tv	was	on	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	 document 	 ary 	 	.
and	my	dad	is	the	most	 vor 	 acious 	 	 read 	 er 	 	i	know	.
he	can	read	a	novel	or	two	a	day	.
but	when	i	was	little	,	i	remember	,	he	would	kill	flies	in	our	house	with	my	bb	gun	.
and	what	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	me	about	that	--	well	he	would	be	in	his	 recline 	 r 	 	,	would	holler	for	me	to	fetch	the	bb	gun	,	and	i	'd	go	get	it	.
and	what	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	me	--	well	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 kick 	 ass 	 	;	he	was	 kill 	 ing 	 	a	fly	in	the	house	with	a	gun	--	but	what	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	me	was	that	he	 k 	 new 	 	just	 en 	 ough 	 	how	to	pump	it	.
and	he	could	shoot	it	from	two	rooms	away	and	not	damage	what	it	was	on	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	pump	it	just	 en 	 ough 	 	to	kill	the	fly	and	not	damage	what	it	 land 	 ed 	 	on	.
so	i	should	talk	about	art	.
or	we	'll	be	here	all	day	with	my	 child 	 hood 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
i	love	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	,	but	i	'm	often	 re 	 ally 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	with	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	world	and	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	scene	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	 month 	 s 	 	in	europe	to	see	the	major	 inter 	 national 	 	art	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	that	have	the	 puls 	 e 	 	of	what	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	going	on	in	the	art	world	.
and	i	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	going	to	so	 man 	 y 	 	,	one	after	the	other	,	with	some	 clar 	 ity 	 	of	what	it	was	that	i	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	.
and	i	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	was	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	,	or	not	 get 	 ting 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	of	.
but	two	of	the	main	 thing 	 s 	 	:	one	of	it	,	i	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	more	work	that	was	 appeal 	 ing 	 	to	a	broad	public	,	that	was	 access 	 ible 	 	.
and	the	second	thing	that	i	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	was	some	more	exquisite	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 ship 	 	and	 techni 	 que 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 list 	 ing 	 	what	all	it	was	that	i	thought	would	make	a	perfect	biennial	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	start	my	own	biennial	.
i	'm	going	to	organize	it	and	direct	it	and	get	it	going	in	the	world	.
so	i	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	have	to	have	some	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	of	how	to	 choos 	 e 	 	work	.
so	 among 	 st 	 	all	the	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	i	have	,	there	's	two	main	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	,	i	call	my	mimaw	's	test	.
and	what	that	is	is	i	imagine	 explain 	 ing 	 	a	work	of	art	to	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	in	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	if	i	ca	n't	explain	it	in	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	then	it	's	too	 obt 	 use 	 	or	esoteric	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 refine 	 d 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	yet	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	to	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 un 	 til 	 	it	can	speak	 fluent 	 ly 	 	.
and	then	my	other	second	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	--	i	hate	to	say	``	 rule 	 s 	 	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	art	--	my	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	would	be	the	three	h	's	,	which	is	head	,	heart	and	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	great	art	would	have	``	head	``	:	it	would	have	 interest 	 ing 	 	intellectual	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
it	would	have	``	heart	``	in	that	it	would	have	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	heart	and	soul	.
and	it	would	have	``	hand	``	in	that	it	would	be	 great 	 ly 	 	 craft 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	am	i	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	biennial	,	how	am	i	going	to	travel	the	world	and	find	these	 artist 	 s 	 	?
and	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	one	day	,	there	's	an	 eas 	 ier 	 	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'm	just	going	to	make	the	whole	thing	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	did	.
so	i	thought	,	a	biennial	 need 	 s 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	do	an	 inter 	 national 	 	biennial	;	i	need	 artist 	 s 	 	from	all	around	the	world	.
so	what	i	did	was	i	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	hundred	 artist 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	.
i	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 ions 	 	in	life	and	 the 	 ir 	 	art	 style 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
i	felt	,	oh	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	project	that	i	could	 s 	 pend 	 	my	whole	life	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	real	biennial	.
it	's	going	to	be	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	studio	work	.
and	i	'm	going	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	have	.
so	i	should	start	to	talk	about	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
well	the	range	is	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 uch 	 	a	technician	,	so	i	 love 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	 get 	 ting 	 	to	play	with	all	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	 re 	 alist 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	it	 range 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	kind	of	old	 master 	 s 	 	style	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	realistic	still	-	life	,	to	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	 paint 	 ing 	 	where	i	'm	 paint 	 ing 	 	with	a	single	hair	.
and	then	at	the	other	end	,	there	's	performance	and	short	 film 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 door 	 	 install 	 ations 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 door 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	and	 out 	 door 	 	 install 	 ations 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
i	know	i	should	 ment 	 ion 	 	:	i	'm	making	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	photoshopped	.
i	'm	under	the	river	with	 t 	 hose 	 	fish	.
so	now	let	me	 introduc 	 e 	 	some	of	my	 fiction 	 al 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	to	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	nell	remmel	.
nell	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 process 	 es 	 	,	and	her	work	is	based	in	these	 practice 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	piece	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 flip 	 ped 	 	earth	``	--	she	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	taking	the	sky	and	using	it	to	 clean 	 s 	 e 	 	 bar 	 ren 	 	ground	.
and	by	taking	giant	 mirror 	 s 	 	--	and	here	she	's	taking	giant	 mirror 	 s 	 	and	 pull 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	dirt	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	22	feet	long	.
and	what	i	 love 	 d 	 	about	her	work	is	,	when	i	would	walk	around	it	and	look	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	,	looking	down	to	watch	the	sky	,	and	it	 un 	 fold 	 ed 	 	in	a	new	way	.
and	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	piece	is	at	 du 	 s 	 k 	 	and	dawn	when	the	 t 	 wi 	 light 	 	wedge	 ha 	 s 	 	 fall 	 en 	 	and	the	ground	's	dark	,	but	there	's	still	the	light	above	,	bright	above	.
and	so	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	is	dark	,	but	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 port 	 al 	 	that	you	want	to	jump	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	piece	was	great	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	my	 parent 	 s 	 	'	 back 	 yard 	 	in	arkansas	.
and	i	love	to	dig	a	hole	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	piece	was	great	 f 	 un 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	two	 day 	 s 	 	of	 dig 	 ging 	 	in	soft	dirt	.
the	next	artist	is	kay	overstry	,	and	she	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 ephemeral 	 ity 	 	and	 trans 	 i 	 ence 	 	.
and	in	her	most	 re 	 cent 	 	project	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	weather	i	made	.	``
and	she	's	making	weather	on	her	body	's	scale	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	piece	is	``	frost	.	``
and	what	she	did	was	she	went	out	on	a	cold	,	dry	night	and	 breath 	 ed 	 	back	and	forth	on	the	lawn	to	 leav 	 e 	 	--	to	 leav 	 e 	 	her	life	's	mark	,	the	mark	of	her	life	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	five	-	foot	,	five	-	 inch 	 es 	 	of	frost	that	she	left	 be 	 hind 	 	.
the	 s 	 un 	 	 rise 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 melt 	 s 	 	away	.
and	that	was	 play 	 ed 	 	by	my	mom	.
so	the	next	artist	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	group	of	japanese	 artist 	 s 	 	,	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	of	japanese	 artist 	 s 	 	--	in	tokyo	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	new	,	 alter 	 native 	 	art	space	,	and	they	 need 	 ed 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	it	,	so	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	come	up	with	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 fund 	 raising 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
one	of	these	is	scratch	-	off	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
and	so	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	--	each	of	these	 artist 	 s 	 	on	a	nine	-	by	-	seven	-	inch	card	,	which	they	sell	for	10	 buck 	 s 	 	,	they	drew	original	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	.
and	you	buy	one	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	you	get	a	real	piece	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	not	.
well	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 spark 	 ed 	 	a	craze	in	japan	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	's	 want 	 ing 	 	a	 master 	 piece 	 	.
and	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	the	most	 s 	 ought 	 	after	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 bare 	 ly 	 	 scratch 	 ed 	 	off	.
and	all	these	 work 	 s 	 	,	in	some	way	,	talk	about	luck	or	fate	or	chance	.
 t 	 hose 	 	first	two	are	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	mega	-	jackpot	 winner 	 s 	 	 year 	 s 	 	before	and	after	 the 	 ir 	 	win	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 draw 	 ing 	 	the	short	stick	.	``
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	piece	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	a	little	cousin	at	home	who	 introduc 	 ed 	 	me	--	which	i	think	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	great	 introduc 	 tion 	 	--	to	a	friend	one	day	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	cousin	shea	.
he	 draw 	 s 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	real	good	.	``
which	is	one	of	the	best	 compliment 	 s 	 	ever	.
 th 	 is 	 	artist	is	gus	weinmueller	,	and	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	a	project	,	a	large	project	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	art	for	the	 people 	 s 	 	.	``
and	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 small 	 er 	 	project	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 artist 	 s 	 	in	residence	.	``
and	what	he	 do 	 es 	 	is	--	he	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	a	week	at	a	time	with	a	family	.
and	he	 show 	 s 	 	up	on	 the 	 ir 	 	porch	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 door 	 step 	 	,	with	a	 tooth 	 brush 	 	and	 pajama 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	ready	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	week	with	them	.
and	using	 on 	 ly 	 	what	's	present	,	he	 go 	 es 	 	in	and	 make 	 s 	 	a	little	 abo 	 de 	 	studio	to	work	out	of	.
and	he	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	that	week	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	family	about	what	do	they	think	great	art	is	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	all	these	 discuss 	 ions 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	family	,	and	he	 dig 	 s 	 	through	 every 	 thing 	 	they	have	,	and	he	 find 	 s 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	make	work	.
and	he	 make 	 s 	 	a	work	that	 answer 	 s 	 	what	they	think	great	art	is	.
for	 th 	 is 	 	family	,	he	made	 th 	 is 	 	still	-	life	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
and	 what 	 ever 	 	he	 make 	 s 	 	 some 	 how 	 	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	 nest 	 ing 	 	and	space	and	personal	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	next	project	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	by	jaochim	parisvega	,	and	he	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	--	he	 believ 	 es 	 	art	is	 every 	 where 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	--	that	it	just	 need 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	of	a	push	to	happen	.
and	he	 provide 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	push	by	 harness 	 ing 	 	natural	 force 	 s 	 	,	like	in	his	 s 	 eries 	 	where	he	used	rain	to	make	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	project	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	love	 nest 	 s 	 	.	``
what	he	did	was	to	get	wild	 bird 	 s 	 	to	make	his	art	for	him	.
so	he	put	the	material	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	 bird 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	collect	them	,	and	they	 craft 	 ed 	 	his	 nest 	 s 	 	for	him	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	lovelock	's	nest	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 mix 	 tape 	 	love	song	's	nest	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	lovemaking	nest	.	``
next	is	sylvia	slater	.
sylvia	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	art	training	.
she	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	swiss	artist	.
and	she	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	her	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	who	work	in	 cha 	 os 	 	-	ridden	 place 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	she	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	what	can	i	make	that	would	be	of	value	to	them	,	in	case	 some 	 thing 	 	bad	 happen 	 s 	 	and	they	have	to	buy	 the 	 ir 	 	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	border	or	pay	off	a	 gun 	 man 	 	?
and	so	she	came	up	with	creating	these	pocket	-	sized	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	that	are	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	the	person	that	would	carry	them	.
and	you	would	carry	 th 	 is 	 	around	with	you	,	and	if	 every 	 thing 	 	went	to	hell	,	you	could	make	 payment 	 s 	 	and	buy	your	life	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	life	price	is	for	an	 irrig 	 ation 	 	non	-	profit	director	.
so	 hope 	 fully 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	never	use	it	,	and	it	's	an	 heir 	 loom 	 	that	you	pass	down	.
and	she	 make 	 s 	 	them	so	they	could	either	be	broken	up	 in 	 to 	 	 payment 	 s 	 	,	or	they	could	be	like	these	,	which	are	 leav 	 es 	 	that	can	be	 payment 	 s 	 	.
and	so	they	're	 valu 	 able 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	precious	 metal 	 s 	 	and	 gem 	 stone 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	had	to	get	broken	up	.
he	had	to	break	off	a	piece	to	get	out	of	egypt	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	by	a	 du 	 o 	 	,	michael	abernathy	and	bud	holland	.
and	they	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	creating	culture	,	just	tradition	.
so	what	they	do	is	they	move	 in 	 to 	 	an	area	and	try	to	establish	a	new	tradition	in	a	small	 geo 	 graphic 	 	area	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	eastern	tennessee	,	and	what	they	 decide 	 d 	 	was	that	we	need	a	positive	tradition	that	 go 	 es 	 	with	death	.
so	they	came	up	with	``	dig	 jig 	 s 	 	.	``
and	a	dig	jig	--	a	dig	jig	is	where	,	for	a	 mile 	 stone 	 	 annivers 	 ary 	 	or	a	 birth 	 day 	 	,	you	gather	all	your	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	together	and	you	dance	on	where	you	're	going	to	be	buried	.
and	we	got	a	lot	of	attention	when	we	did	it	.
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	my	family	 in 	 to 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	did	n't	know	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	was	like	,	``	get	 dress 	 ed 	 	for	a	funeral	.	we	're	going	to	go	do	some	work	.	``
and	so	we	got	to	the	grave	and	made	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	was	hilarious	--	the	attention	that	we	got	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	dance	on	the	grave	,	and	after	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	your	dance	,	 every 	 one 	 	 toast 	 s 	 	you	and	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	great	you	are	.
and	you	in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	have	a	funeral	that	you	get	to	be	present	for	.
that	's	my	mom	and	dad	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	by	jason	 bird 	 song 	 	.
he	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	we	see	 a 	 s 	 	an	animal	,	how	we	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	mimicry	and	camouflage	.
you	know	,	we	look	down	a	dark	 al 	 ley 	 	or	a	jungle	path	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	out	a	face	or	a	creature	.
we	just	have	that	natural	way	of	 see 	 ing 	 	.
and	he	 play 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	piece	:	 t 	 hose 	 	are	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	.
they	're	 butter 	 fly 	 	 specimen 	 s 	 	who	have	a	natural	camouflage	.
so	he	 pair 	 s 	 	these	up	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	pile	of	 leav 	 es 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	all	real	 butter 	 fly 	 	 specimen 	 s 	 	.
