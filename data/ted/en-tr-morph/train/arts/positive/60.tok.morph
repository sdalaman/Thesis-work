so	my	 grand 	 father 	 	told	me	when	i	was	a	little	girl	,	``	if	you	say	a	word	often	 en 	 ough 	 	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	you	.	``
and	 hav 	 ing 	 	grown	up	in	a	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	city	,	baltimore	,	maryland	,	i	sort	of	use	that	idea	to	go	around	america	with	a	tape	 record 	 er 	 	--	thank	god	for	technology	--	to	interview	people	,	 think 	 ing 	 	that	if	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 word 	 s 	 	--	which	is	 al 	 so 	 	why	i	do	n't	wear	 shoe 	 s 	 	when	i	perform	--	if	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	that	i	could	sort	of	absorb	america	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	inspired	by	walt	whitman	,	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	absorb	america	and	have	it	absorb	him	.
so	these	four	 character 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	from	that	work	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	and	well	over	,	i	do	n't	know	,	a	couple	of	thousand	people	i	've	 interview 	 ed 	 	.
 any 	 body 	 	out	here	old	 en 	 ough 	 	to	know	 stud 	 s 	 	terkel	,	that	old	radio	man	?
so	i	thought	he	would	be	the	perfect	person	to	go	to	to	ask	about	a	 defi 	 ning 	 	moment	in	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
you	know	,	he	was	``	born	in	1912	,	the	year	the	 titan 	 ic 	 	 s 	 an 	 k 	 	,	 great 	 est 	 	ship	every	built	.	 hit 	 s 	 	the	tip	of	an	 ice 	 berg 	 	,	and	 b 	 am 	 	,	it	went	down	.	it	went	down	and	i	came	up	.	 w 	 ow 	 	,	some	century	.	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	his	answer	about	a	 defi 	 ning 	 	moment	in	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
``	 defi 	 ning 	 	moment	in	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	i	do	n't	think	there	's	one	;	you	ca	n't	say	hiroshima	,	that	's	a	big	one	--	i	ca	n't	think	of	any	one	moment	i	would	say	is	a	 defi 	 ning 	 	moment	.
the	 gradu 	 al 	 	 slip 	 page 	 	--	'	 slip 	 page 	 	'	is	the	word	used	by	the	people	in	watergate	,	moral	 slip 	 page 	 	--	it	's	a	 gradu 	 al 	 	kind	of	thing	,	combination	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	see	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	technology	.
i	say	,	less	and	less	the	human	touch	.
``	oh	,	let	me	kind	of	tell	you	a	funny	little	play	bit	.
the	atlanta	 air 	 port 	 	is	a	modern	 air 	 port 	 	,	and	they	should	 leav 	 e 	 	the	gate	there	.
these	 train 	 s 	 	that	take	you	out	to	a	 con 	 course 	 	and	on	to	a	destination	.
and	these	 train 	 s 	 	are	smooth	,	and	they	're	quiet	and	they	're	efficient	.
and	there	's	a	voice	on	the	train	,	you	know	the	voice	was	a	human	voice	.
you	see	in	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	we	had	 robot 	 s 	 	,	 robot 	 s 	 	 imit 	 ated 	 	 human 	 s 	 	.
now	we	have	 human 	 s 	 	 imit 	 ating 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	.
so	we	got	 th 	 is 	 	voice	on	 th 	 is 	 	train	:	 con 	 course 	 	one	:	omaha	,	lincoln	.
 con 	 course 	 	two	:	dallas	,	fort	worth	.	same	voice	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	a	train	is	about	to	go	,	a	young	couple	rush	in	and	they	're	just	about	to	close	the	pneumatic	 door 	 s 	 	.
and	that	voice	,	 with 	 out 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	a	beat	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	'	 be 	 cause 	 	of	late	entry	,	we	're	 delay 	 ed 	 	30	 second 	 s 	 	.	'	just	then	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	couple	with	 hate 	 ful 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	and	the	couple	's	going	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	,	 shrink 	 ing 	 	.
well	,	i	'd	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	have	had	a	couple	of	 drink 	 s 	 	before	 board 	 ing 	 	--	i	do	that	to	steel	my	 nerve 	 s 	 	--	and	so	i	 imit 	 ate 	 	a	train	call	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	my	hand	on	my	--	'	george	orwell	,	your	time	 ha 	 s 	 	come	,	'	you	see	.
well	,	some	of	you	are	 laugh 	 ing 	 	.	 every 	 body 	 	 laugh 	 s 	 	when	i	say	that	,	but	not	on	 th 	 is 	 	train	.	silence	.
and	so	 sudden 	 ly 	 	they	're	looking	at	me	.
so	here	i	am	with	the	couple	,	the	three	of	us	 shrink 	 ing 	 	at	the	foot	of	calvary	about	to	be	up	,	you	know	.
``	just	then	i	see	a	baby	,	a	little	baby	in	the	lap	of	a	mother	.
i	know	it	's	hispanic	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	 s 	 peaking 	 	spanish	to	her	companion	.
so	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	the	baby	.	so	i	say	to	the	baby	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	my	hand	over	my	mouth	 be 	 cause 	 	my	breath	must	be	100	proof	,	i	say	to	the	baby	,	'	 s 	 ir 	 	or	madam	,	what	is	your	 consider 	 ed 	 	opinion	of	the	human	species	?	'	and	the	baby	 look 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	the	way	 bab 	 ies 	 	look	at	you	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	 start 	 s 	 	 laugh 	 ing 	 	,	 start 	 s 	 	 bust 	 ing 	 	out	with	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	little	laugh	.
i	say	,	'	thank	god	for	a	human	 re 	 action 	 	,	we	have	n't	lost	yet	.	'	``	but	you	see	,	the	human	touch	,	you	see	,	it	's	 disappear 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	you	see	,	you	've	got	to	question	the	official	truth	.
you	know	the	thing	that	was	so	great	about	mark	 tw 	 ain 	 	--	you	know	we	honor	mark	 tw 	 ain 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	read	him	.
we	read	'	huck	finn	,	'	of	course	,	we	read	'	huck	finn	'	of	course	.
i	mean	,	huck	,	of	course	,	was	tremendous	.
remember	that	great	scene	on	the	raft	,	remember	what	huck	did	?
you	see	,	here	's	huck	;	he	's	an	illiterate	kid	;	he	's	had	no	 school 	 ing 	 	,	but	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	in	him	.
and	the	official	truth	,	the	truth	was	,	the	law	was	,	that	a	black	man	was	a	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	was	a	thing	,	you	see	.
and	huck	 get 	 s 	 	on	the	raft	with	a	 proper 	 ty 	 	named	jim	,	a	slave	,	see	.
and	he	 hear 	 s 	 	that	jim	is	going	to	go	and	take	his	wife	and	 kid 	 s 	 	and	steal	them	from	the	woman	who	 own 	 s 	 	them	,	and	huck	 say 	 s 	 	,	'	ooh	,	oh	my	god	,	ooh	,	ooh	--	that	woman	,	that	woman	never	did	 any 	 body 	 	any	harm	.
ooh	,	he	's	going	to	steal	;	he	's	going	to	steal	;	he	's	going	to	do	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	.	'	just	then	,	two	 slave 	 rs 	 	caught	up	,	 guy 	 s 	 	chasing	 slave 	 s 	 	,	looking	for	jim	.
'	 any 	 body 	 	up	on	that	raft	with	you	?	'	huck	 say 	 s 	 	,	'	 yea 	 h 	 	.	'	'	is	he	black	or	white	?	'	'	white	.	'	and	they	go	off	.
and	huck	 s 	 aid 	 	,	'	oh	my	god	,	oh	my	god	,	i	 li 	 ed 	 	,	i	 li 	 ed 	 	,	ooh	,	i	did	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	,	did	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	--	why	do	i	feel	so	good	?	'	``	but	it	's	the	 good 	 ness 	 	of	huck	,	that	stuff	that	huck	's	 be 	 en 	 	made	of	,	you	see	,	all	 be 	 en 	 	buried	;	it	's	all	 be 	 en 	 	buried	.
so	the	human	touch	,	you	see	,	it	's	 disappear 	 ing 	 	.
so	you	ask	about	a	 defi 	 ning 	 	moment	--	ai	n't	no	 defi 	 ning 	 	moment	in	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	for	me	.
it	's	an	 ac 	 cre 	 tion 	 	of	 moment 	 s 	 	that	add	up	to	where	we	are	now	,	where	 tri 	 via 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	news	.
and	more	and	more	,	less	and	less	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	the	pain	of	the	other	.
huh	.	you	know	,	i	do	n't	know	if	you	could	use	 th 	 is 	 	or	not	,	but	i	was	 quo 	 ting 	 	wright	morris	,	a	writer	from	nebraska	,	who	 say 	 s 	 	,	'	we	're	more	and	more	 in 	 to 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	and	less	and	less	 in 	 to 	 	communication	.	'	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 kid 	 s 	 	,	i	got	to	 s 	 cram 	 	,	got	to	go	see	my	 cardio 	 logist 	 	.	``
and	that	's	 stud 	 s 	 	terkel	.
so	,	talk	about	risk	taking	.	i	'm	going	to	do	 some 	 body 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	 like 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	most	 act 	 ors 	 	want	to	do	 character 	 s 	 	that	are	 like 	 able 	 	--	well	,	not	 al 	 ways 	 	,	but	the	 not 	 ion 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	like	to	inspire	people	.
but	since	 th 	 is 	 	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	risk	taking	,	``	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	i	never	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	so	 un 	 like 	 able 	 	that	one	person	 actual 	 ly 	 	came	 back 	 stage 	 	and	told	me	to	take	her	out	of	the	show	she	was	in	.
and	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	her	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	we	think	of	risk	,	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	good	thing	.
but	there	are	certain	other	 con 	 not 	 ations 	 	to	the	word	``	risk	,	``	and	the	same	thing	about	the	word	``	nature	.	``	what	is	nature	?
maxine	greene	,	who	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 philosoph 	 er 	 	who	's	 a 	 s 	 	old	 a 	 s 	 	 stud 	 s 	 	,	and	was	the	head	of	a	 philosoph 	 y 	 	--	great	,	big	 philosoph 	 y 	 	kind	of	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	--	i	went	to	her	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	what	are	the	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	,	that	she	still	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	still	feel	like	i	have	to	 cur 	 ts 	 ey 	 	when	i	see	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	my	university	.

so	 th 	 is 	 	piece	is	about	a	negative	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
it	 raise 	 s 	 	 question 	 s 	 	about	what	nature	is	,	what	mother	nature	is	,	and	about	what	a	risk	can	be	.
and	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	maryland	 correct 	 ional 	 	institute	for	women	.
 every 	 thing 	 	i	do	is	word	for	word	off	a	tape	.

explosion	of	joy	that	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 dict 	 	had	come	back	 th 	 is 	 	way	.

and	so	 th 	 is 	 	woman	,	mrs.	young	-	soon	han	,	i	suppose	will	have	taught	me	the	most	that	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	race	.
and	she	 ask 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	a	question	that	 stud 	 s 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	about	:	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	``	official	truth	,	``	to	question	the	``	official	truth	.	``
so	what	she	's	 question 	 ing 	 	here	,	she	's	taking	a	chance	and	 question 	 ing 	 	what	justice	is	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	 swallow 	 ing 	 	the	 bitter 	 ness 	 	.	``
``	i	used	to	 believ 	 e 	 	america	was	the	best	.

i	never	saw	any	poor	man	,	any	black	.
 un 	 til 	 	1992	,	i	used	to	 believ 	 e 	 	america	was	the	best	--	i	still	do	;	i	do	n't	 den 	 y 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	a	victim	.
but	at	the	end	of	'92	,	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	turmoil	,	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	all	the	financial	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	all	the	mental	 problem 	 s 	 	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	that	koreans	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	left	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	we	are	 noth 	 ing 	 	.

we	did	n't	get	any	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	a	car	and	a	house	.
and	we	are	high	taxpayer	.	where	do	i	find	justice	?
``	ok	.	ok	?	ok	.	ok	.
 man 	 y 	 	african	-	americans	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	that	they	won	by	the	trial	.

they	got	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	by	 destroy 	 ing 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	korean	 merchan 	 ts 	 	.
they	have	a	lot	of	respect	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	do	,	for	dr.	martin	king	.

he	is	the	model	of	non	-	violence	,	non	-	violence	--	and	they	would	all	like	to	be	in	his	spirit	.
``	but	what	about	1992	?	they	 destroy 	 ed 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	people	.
and	i	wonder	if	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	justice	for	them	,	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	in	that	way	.
i	was	 swallow 	 ing 	 	the	 bitter 	 ness 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	 al 	 one 	 	and	 watch 	 ing 	 	them	.
they	 be 	 came 	 	so	hilarious	,	but	i	was	happy	for	them	.
i	was	glad	for	them	.	at	 l 	 east 	 	they	got	 some 	 thing 	 	back	,	ok	.
let	's	just	forget	about	korean	 victim 	 s 	 	and	other	 victim 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	them	.
they	 f 	 ought 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	for	over	two	centuries	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	sacrifice	other	 minor 	 ities 	 	,	hispanic	,	asian	,	we	would	suffer	more	in	the	 main 	 stream 	 	.
that	's	why	i	understand	;	that	's	why	i	have	a	 mix 	 ed 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	about	the	 ver 	 dict 	 	.
``	but	i	wish	that	,	i	wish	that	,	i	wish	that	i	could	be	part	of	the	 enjoy 	 ment 	 	.

but	after	the	riot	,	it	's	too	much	 differ 	 ence 	 	.

mrs.	young	-	soon	han	.
the	other	reason	that	i	do	n't	wear	 shoe 	 s 	 	is	just	in	case	i	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	like	i	have	to	 cuddl 	 e 	 	up	and	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	feet	of	 some 	 body 	 	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	in	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
and	i	told	you	that	in	--	you	know	,	i	did	n't	give	you	the	year	,	but	in	'79	i	thought	that	i	was	going	to	go	around	and	find	bull	 rider 	 s 	 	and	pig	 farm 	 ers 	 	and	people	like	that	,	and	i	got	 side 	 track 	 ed 	 	on	race	 relation 	 s 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	did	find	a	bull	rider	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	going	to	the	 rodeo 	 s 	 	with	him	,	and	we	've	 bond 	 ed 	 	.
and	he	's	the	lead	in	an	op	-	ed	i	did	about	the	republican	convention	.
he	's	a	republican	--	i	wo	n't	say	 any 	 thing 	 	about	my	party	 affili 	 ation 	 	,	but	 any 	 way 	 	--	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	dear	,	dear	brent	williams	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	on	 tough 	 ness 	 	,	in	case	 any 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	know	about	 be 	 ing 	 	tough	for	the	work	that	you	do	.	i	think	there	's	a	real	 less 	 on 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 tough 	 ness 	 	.	``
``	well	,	i	'm	an	optimist	.	i	mean	 bas 	 ically 	 	i	'm	an	optimist	.
i	mean	,	you	know	,	i	mean	,	it	's	like	my	wife	,	jolene	,	her	family	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	you	ever	think	he	's	just	a	born	 lose 	 r 	 	?
it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	he	 ha 	 s 	 	so	much	bad	luck	,	you	know	.
but	then	when	that	bull	 steppe 	 d 	 	on	my	 kid 	 ney 	 	,	you	know	,	i	did	n't	lose	my	 kid 	 ney 	 	--	i	could	have	lost	my	 kid 	 ney 	 	,	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	my	 kid 	 ney 	 	,	so	i	do	n't	think	i	'm	a	born	 lose 	 r 	 	.

i	was	in	a	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	last	cat	 s 	 can 	 	,	and	there	was	a	 read 	 er 	 	's	digest	,	october	2002	.
it	was	like	,	'	seven	ways	to	get	 luck 	 y 	 	.	'	and	it	 say 	 s 	 	if	you	want	to	get	 luck 	 y 	 	,	you	know	,	you	've	got	to	be	around	positive	people	.
i	mean	,	like	even	when	i	told	my	wife	that	you	want	to	come	out	here	and	talk	to	me	,	she	's	like	,	'	she	's	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	;	she	's	just	 be 	 ing 	 	nice	to	you	.	she	's	not	going	to	do	that	.

you	're	not	even	going	to	be	able	to	answer	her	 question 	 s 	 	.	'	and	she	was	 say 	 ing 	 	you	're	going	to	make	me	look	like	an	idiot	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	to	college	,	and	i	would	n't	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	professional	or	 any 	 thing 	 	.

you	know	,	if	i	was	n't	 talk 	 ing 	 	--	you	know	,	like	,	you	know	,	she	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	talk	,	i	do	n't	think	she	would	even	come	out	here	.	'	``	confidence	?	well	,	i	think	i	ride	more	out	of	 determi 	 nation 	 	than	confidence	.
i	mean	,	confidence	is	like	,	you	know	,	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	on	that	bull	before	;	you	know	you	can	ride	him	.
i	mean	,	confidence	is	kind	of	like	 be 	 ing 	 	 cock 	 y 	 	,	but	in	a	good	way	.
but	 determi 	 nation 	 	,	you	know	,	it	's	like	just	,	you	know	,	'	fuck	the	form	,	get	the	horn	.	'	that	's	tuff	hedeman	,	in	the	movie	'8	 second 	 s 	 	.

'	and	try	and	 determi 	 nation 	 	is	the	same	thing	.
 determi 	 nation 	 	is	,	like	,	you	're	going	to	hang	on	that	bull	,	even	if	you	're	 rid 	 ing 	 	 up 	 side 	 	down	.
