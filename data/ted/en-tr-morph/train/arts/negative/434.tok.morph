i	'm	going	to	talk	about	a	 ver 	 y 	 	fundamental	change	that	is	going	on	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	fabric	of	the	modern	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	to	talk	about	that	,	i	'm	going	to	go	back	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 commodit 	 ies 	 	.
 commodit 	 ies 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	grow	in	the	ground	,	raise	on	the	ground	or	pull	out	of	the	ground	:	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	animal	,	mineral	,	 veget 	 able 	 	.
and	then	you	 ex 	 tract 	 	them	out	of	the	ground	,	and	sell	them	on	the	open	 market 	 place 	 	.
 commodit 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	the	 agr 	 arian 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	 last 	 ed 	 	for	millennia	.
but	then	 a 	 long 	 	came	the	industrial	revolution	,	and	then	 good 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	 pre 	 domin 	 ant 	 	economic	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	,	where	we	used	 commodit 	 ies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	raw	material	to	be	able	to	make	or	 manufactur 	 e 	 	 good 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	 move 	 d 	 	from	an	 agr 	 arian 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	an	industrial	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
well	,	what	then	 happen 	 ed 	 	over	the	last	50	or	60	 year 	 s 	 	,	is	that	 good 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	 commodit 	 ized 	 	.
 commodit 	 ized 	 	:	where	they	're	 treat 	 ed 	 	like	a	 commodit 	 y 	 	,	where	people	do	n't	care	who	 make 	 s 	 	them	.
they	just	care	about	three	 thing 	 s 	 	and	three	 thing 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	:	price	,	price	and	price	.
now	,	there	's	an	antidote	to	 commodit 	 ization 	 	,	and	that	is	 custom 	 ization 	 	.
my	first	book	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	mass	 custom 	 ization 	 	``	--	it	came	up	a	couple	of	 time 	 s 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	--	and	how	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	economic	value	was	 real 	 izing 	 	that	 custom 	 izing 	 	a	good	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	service	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	just	for	a	 part 	 icular 	 	person	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	n't	 inventor 	 ied 	 	,	it	was	 deliver 	 ed 	 	on	demand	to	that	individual	person	.
so	,	we	 move 	 d 	 	from	an	industrial	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	a	service	-	based	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
but	over	the	past	10	or	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	that	 service 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 commodit 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
long	-	distance	 tele 	 phone 	 	service	 s 	 old 	 	on	price	,	price	,	price	;	fast	-	food	 restaurant 	 s 	 	with	all	 the 	 ir 	 	value	 pric 	 ing 	 	;	and	even	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 commodit 	 izing 	 	not	just	 good 	 s 	 	,	but	 service 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	it	's	time	to	move	to	a	new	level	of	economic	value	.
time	to	go	beyond	the	 good 	 s 	 	and	the	 service 	 s 	 	,	and	use	,	in	that	same	heuristic	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	 custom 	 ize 	 	a	service	?
what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	design	a	service	that	is	so	appropriate	for	a	 part 	 icular 	 	person	--	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	they	need	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	in	time	?
then	you	ca	n't	help	but	make	them	go	``	 w 	 ow 	 	``	;	you	ca	n't	help	but	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 memor 	 able 	 	event	--	you	ca	n't	help	but	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	experience	.
so	we	're	shifting	to	an	experience	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	where	 experience 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	the	 pre 	 domin 	 ant 	 	economic	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	.
now	most	 place 	 s 	 	that	i	talk	to	,	when	i	talk	about	experience	,	i	talk	about	disney	--	the	world	's	 pre 	 mi 	 er 	 	experience	-	stager	.
i	talk	about	theme	 restaurant 	 s 	 	,	and	 ex 	 peri 	 ential 	 	 re 	 tail 	 	,	and	 bout 	 ique 	 	 hotel 	 s 	 	,	and	las	vegas	--	the	experience	capital	of	the	world	.
but	here	,	when	you	think	about	 experience 	 s 	 	,	think	about	thomas	dolby	and	his	group	,	 play 	 ing 	 	music	.
think	about	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
think	about	 drink 	 ing 	 	wine	,	about	a	journey	to	the	clock	of	the	long	now	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	 experience 	 s 	 	.	think	about	ted	 it 	 self 	 	.
the	experience	capital	in	the	world	of	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	.
all	of	these	are	 experience 	 s 	 	.
now	,	over	the	last	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	europe	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	the	netherlands	,	and	 when 	 ever 	 	i	talk	about	the	experience	 eco 	 nomy 	 	there	,	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 greet 	 ed 	 	at	the	end	with	one	 part 	 icular 	 	question	,	 al 	 most 	 	 in 	 vari 	 ably 	 	.
and	the	question	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	so	much	a	question	 a 	 s 	 	an	 accus 	 ation 	 	.
and	the	dutch	,	when	they	 usual 	 ly 	 	put	it	,	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 start 	 s 	 	with	the	same	two	 word 	 s 	 	.
you	know	the	 word 	 s 	 	i	mean	?
you	americans	.
they	say	,	you	americans	.
you	like	your	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	,	your	fake	,	your	disneyland	 experience 	 s 	 	.
they	say	,	we	dutch	,	we	like	real	,	natural	,	authentic	 experience 	 s 	 	.
so	much	 ha 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	that	i	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 p 	 ratic 	 ed 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	which	is	:	i	point	out	that	first	of	all	,	you	have	to	understand	that	there	is	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 authentic 	 	experience	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	the	experience	 happen 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	us	.
it	's	our	 re 	 action 	 	to	the	 event 	 s 	 	that	are	 stag 	 ed 	 	in	front	of	us	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	in	any	sense	authentic	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	then	every	experience	we	have	is	authentic	.
now	,	there	may	be	more	or	less	natural	or	artificial	 stimul 	 i 	 	for	the	experience	,	but	even	that	is	a	matter	of	degree	,	not	kind	.
and	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	100	percent	natural	experience	.
even	if	you	go	for	a	walk	in	the	proverbial	 wood 	 s 	 	,	there	is	a	company	that	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	the	car	that	 deliver 	 ed 	 	you	to	the	edge	of	the	 wood 	 s 	 	;	there	's	a	company	that	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	that	you	have	to	protect	 your 	 self 	 	from	the	ground	of	the	 wood 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	company	that	 provide 	 s 	 	a	cell	phone	service	you	have	in	case	you	get	lost	in	the	 wood 	 s 	 	.
right	?	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	are	man	-	made	,	 artificial 	 ity 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 wood 	 s 	 	by	you	,	and	by	the	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	of	 be 	 ing 	 	there	.
and	then	i	 al 	 ways 	 	finish	off	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	the	thing	that	 amaze 	 s 	 	me	the	most	about	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	coming	from	the	dutch	,	is	that	the	netherlands	is	every	bit	 a 	 s 	 	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	disneyland	.
and	the	dutch	,	they	 al 	 ways 	 	go	...
and	they	 real 	 ize 	 	,	i	'm	right	!
there	is	n't	a	square	meter	of	ground	in	the	entire	country	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 claim 	 ed 	 	from	the	sea	,	or	 other 	 wise 	 	 move 	 d 	 	,	 modifi 	 ed 	 	and	 mani 	 cur 	 ed 	 	to	look	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	there	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	you	ever	go	for	a	walk	in	the	 wood 	 s 	 	and	all	the	 tree 	 s 	 	are	lined	up	in	 row 	 s 	 	.
but	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	not	just	the	dutch	,	but	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	for	the	authentic	.
and	 authentic 	 ity 	 	is	 there 	 fore 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	the	new	consumer	 sens 	 ibility 	 	--	the	 buy 	 ing 	 	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	by	which	 consumer 	 s 	 	are	 choos 	 ing 	 	who	are	they	going	to	buy	from	,	and	what	they	're	going	to	buy	.
 be 	 coming 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
in	fact	,	you	can	look	at	how	each	of	these	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	that	each	one	 ha 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	business	 imper 	 ative 	 	,	 match 	 ed 	 	with	a	consumer	 sens 	 ibility 	 	.
we	're	the	 agr 	 arian 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	we	're	 supply 	 ing 	 	 commodit 	 ies 	 	.
it	's	about	supply	and	 avail 	 ability 	 	.
 get 	 ting 	 	the	 commodit 	 ies 	 	to	market	.
with	the	industrial	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	it	is	about	 controll 	 ing 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	--	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 cost 	 s 	 	down	 a 	 s 	 	low	 a 	 s 	 	possible	so	we	can	 off 	 er 	 	them	to	the	 masse 	 s 	 	.
with	the	service	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	it	is	about	that	 ha 	 s 	 	--	the	whole	quality	 move 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ris 	 en 	 	with	the	service	 eco 	 nomy 	 	over	the	past	20	or	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	now	,	with	the	experience	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	it	's	about	 render 	 ing 	 	 authentic 	 ity 	 	.
 render 	 ing 	 	 authentic 	 ity 	 	--	and	the	 key 	 word 	 	is	``	 render 	 ing 	 	.	``
right	?	 render 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	get	your	 consumer 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	business	people	--	to	 per 	 ci 	 eve 	 	your	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	authentic	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	paradox	:	no	one	can	have	an	 in 	 authentic 	 	experience	,	but	no	business	can	supply	one	.
 be 	 cause 	 	all	 business 	 es 	 	are	man	-	made	 object 	 s 	 	;	all	business	is	 involve 	 d 	 	with	money	;	all	business	is	a	matter	of	using	 machine 	 ry 	 	,	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	make	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 authentic 	 	.
so	,	how	do	you	render	 authentic 	 ity 	 	,	is	the	question	.
are	you	 render 	 ing 	 	 authentic 	 ity 	 	?
when	you	think	about	that	,	let	me	go	back	to	what	lionel	trilling	,	in	his	 semi 	 nal 	 	book	on	 authentic 	 ity 	 	,	``	 since 	 r 	 ity 	 	and	 authentic 	 ity 	 	``	--	came	out	in	1960	--	 point 	 s 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	the	 semi 	 nal 	 	point	at	which	 authentic 	 ity 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	 lexic 	 on 	 	,	if	you	will	.
and	that	is	,	to	no	surprise	,	in	shakespeare	,	and	in	his	play	,	 ham 	 let 	 	.
and	there	is	one	part	in	 th 	 is 	 	play	,	 ham 	 let 	 	,	where	the	most	fake	of	all	the	 character 	 s 	 	in	 ham 	 let 	 	,	polonius	,	 say 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	real	.
at	the	end	of	a	 laundr 	 y 	 	list	of	 ad 	 vice 	 	he	's	giving	to	his	son	,	laertes	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	and	 th 	 is 	 	above	all	:	to	 th 	 ine 	 	own	self	be	true	.
and	it	 do 	 th 	 	follow	,	 a 	 s 	 	night	the	day	,	that	 th 	 ou 	 	 can 	 st 	 	not	then	be	false	to	any	man	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 verse 	 s 	 	are	the	core	of	 authentic 	 ity 	 	.
there	are	two	 dimension 	 s 	 	to	 authentic 	 ity 	 	:	one	,	 be 	 ing 	 	true	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	self	-	 direct 	 ed 	 	.
two	,	is	other	-	 direct 	 ed 	 	:	 be 	 ing 	 	what	you	say	you	are	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	 when 	 ever 	 	i	 en 	 counter 	 	two	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	go	,	ahh	,	two	-	by	-	two	!
all	right	?	 any 	 body 	 	else	like	that	,	no	?
well	,	if	you	think	about	that	,	you	do	,	in	fact	,	get	a	two	-	by	-	two	.
where	,	on	one	dimension	it	's	a	matter	of	 be 	 ing 	 	true	to	 your 	 self 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 business 	 es 	 	,	are	the	economic	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 s 	 	you	are	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	--	are	they	true	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	?
and	the	other	dimension	is	:	are	they	what	they	say	they	are	to	 other 	 s 	 	?
if	not	,	you	have	,	``	is	not	true	to	 it 	 self 	 	,	``	and	``	is	not	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	it	is	,	``	 yield 	 ing 	 	a	two	-	by	-	two	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
and	of	course	,	if	you	are	both	true	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	are	what	you	say	you	are	,	then	you	're	real	real	!
the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	of	course	,	is	--	fake	fake	.
all	right	,	now	,	there	is	value	for	fake	.
there	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	around	to	supply	the	fake	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 desir 	 e 	 	for	the	fake	.
fact	is	,	there	's	a	general	rule	:	if	you	do	n't	like	it	,	it	's	fake	;	if	you	do	like	it	,	it	's	faux	.
now	,	the	other	two	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	 co 	 in 	 	are	:	 be 	 ing 	 	a	real	fake	--	is	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	it	is	,	but	is	not	true	to	 it 	 self 	 	,	or	 be 	 ing 	 	a	fake	real	:	is	true	to	 it 	 self 	 	,	but	not	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	it	is	.
you	can	think	about	 t 	 hose 	 	two	--	you	know	,	both	of	these	better	than	 be 	 ing 	 	fake	fake	--	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	real	real	.
you	can	contrast	them	by	 think 	 ing 	 	about	universal	city	walk	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	disney	world	,	or	disneyland	.
universal	city	walk	is	a	real	fake	--	in	fact	,	we	got	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	term	from	ada	louise	huxtable	's	book	,	``	the	 un 	 real 	 	america	.	``
a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	book	,	where	she	 talk 	 s 	 	about	universal	city	walk	 a 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	she	 decr 	 ies 	 	the	fake	,	but	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	that	's	a	real	fake	,	right	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	see	 be 	 hind 	 	the	facade	,	right	?
it	is	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	it	is	:	it	's	universal	studio	;	it	's	in	the	city	of	los	angeles	;	you	're	going	to	walk	a	lot	.
right	?	you	do	n't	tend	to	walk	a	lot	in	los	angeles	,	well	,	here	's	a	place	where	you	are	going	to	walk	a	lot	,	 out 	 side 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	city	.
but	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	true	to	 it 	 self 	 	?
right	?	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	in	the	city	?
is	it	--	you	can	see	 be 	 hind 	 	all	of	it	,	and	see	what	is	going	on	in	the	 facade 	 s 	 	of	it	.
so	she	 call 	 s 	 	it	a	real	fake	.
disney	world	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	a	fake	real	,	or	a	fake	 re 	 ality 	 	.
right	?	it	's	not	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	it	is	.	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	the	magic	 king 	 dom 	 	.
but	it	is	--	oh	,	i	'm	sorry	,	i	did	n't	mean	to	--	--	sorry	.
we	wo	n't	talk	about	santa	claus	then	.
but	disney	world	is	 wonder 	 fully 	 	true	to	 it 	 self 	 	.
right	?	just	 wonder 	 fully 	 	true	to	 it 	 self 	 	.
when	you	are	there	you	are	just	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	environment	.
so	,	it	's	a	fake	real	.
now	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	way	to	fall	down	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	not	be	real	real	,	right	,	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	way	not	to	be	true	to	 your 	 self 	 	is	not	to	understand	your	heritage	,	and	 there 	 by 	 	 re 	 pu 	 di 	 ate 	 	that	heritage	.
right	,	the	key	of	 be 	 ing 	 	true	to	 your 	 self 	 	is	 know 	 ing 	 	who	you	are	 a 	 s 	 	a	business	.
 know 	 ing 	 	where	your	heritage	is	:	what	you	have	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	past	.
and	what	you	have	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	past	 limit 	 s 	 	what	you	can	do	,	what	you	can	get	away	with	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	future	.
so	,	you	have	to	understand	that	past	.
think	about	disney	 aga 	 in 	 	.
disney	,	10	or	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	right	,	the	disney	--	the	company	that	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	best	-	known	for	family	 value 	 s 	 	out	there	,	disney	 b 	 ought 	 	the	abc	network	.
the	abc	network	,	 affect 	 ion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	known	in	the	trade	 a 	 s 	 	the	t	&	a	network	,	right	--	that	's	not	too	much	 jar 	 gon 	 	,	is	it	?
right	,	the	t	&	a	network	.	then	it	 b 	 ought 	 	miramax	,	known	for	 it 	 s 	 	nc	-	17	fare	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	,	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	 every 	 where 	 	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	trust	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	from	disney	.
it	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	true	to	 it 	 s 	 	heritage	;	no	 long 	 er 	 	true	to	walt	disney	.
that	's	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	trouble	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	why	roy	disney	is	out	to	get	michael	eisner	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	true	to	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	,	understand	what	--	your	past	 limit 	 s 	 	what	you	can	do	in	the	future	.
when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	what	you	say	you	are	,	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	that	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	make	is	that	they	advertise	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	are	not	.
that	's	when	you	're	 perceive 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	fake	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	phony	company	--	 advert 	 izing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	're	not	.
think	about	any	hotel	,	any	 air 	 line 	 	,	any	hospital	.
right	,	if	you	could	check	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ad 	 s 	 	,	you	'd	have	a	great	experience	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	you	have	to	experience	the	actual	hotel	,	 air 	 line 	 	and	hospital	,	and	then	you	have	that	 dis 	 connect 	 	.
then	you	have	that	 per 	 ception 	 	that	you	are	phony	.
so	,	the	number	one	thing	to	do	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	what	you	say	you	are	,	is	to	provide	 place 	 s 	 	for	people	to	experience	who	you	are	.
for	people	to	experience	who	you	are	.
right	,	it	's	not	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	.
that	's	why	you	have	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	starbucks	,	right	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	advertise	at	all	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	want	to	know	who	we	are	,	you	have	to	come	experience	us	.
and	think	about	the	economic	value	they	have	 provide 	 d 	 	by	that	experience	.
right	?	coffee	,	at	 it 	 s 	 	core	,	is	what	?
right	?	it	's	 bean 	 s 	 	;	right	?	it	's	coffee	 bean 	 s 	 	.
you	know	how	much	coffee	is	worth	,	when	 treat 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 commodit 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	bean	?
two	or	three	 cent 	 s 	 	per	cup	--	that	's	what	coffee	is	worth	.
but	grind	it	,	roast	it	,	package	it	,	put	it	on	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	shelf	,	and	now	it	'll	cost	five	,	10	,	15	 cent 	 s 	 	,	when	you	treat	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	good	.
take	that	same	good	,	and	perform	the	service	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 brew 	 ing 	 	it	for	a	 custom 	 er 	 	,	in	a	corner	 din 	 er 	 	,	in	a	 bo 	 de 	 ga 	 	,	a	kiosk	 some 	 where 	 	,	you	get	50	 cent 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	buck	per	cup	of	coffee	.
but	surround	the	 brew 	 ing 	 	of	that	coffee	with	the	 ambi 	 ance 	 	of	a	starbucks	,	with	the	authentic	cedar	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	there	,	and	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	authentic	experience	,	you	can	charge	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	a	cup	of	coffee	.
so	,	 authentic 	 ity 	 	is	 be 	 coming 	 	the	new	consumer	 sens 	 ibility 	 	.
let	me	summarize	it	,	for	the	business	people	in	the	audience	,	with	three	 rule 	 s 	 	,	three	 bas 	 ic 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	.
one	,	do	n't	say	you	're	authentic	 un 	 less 	 	you	 re 	 ally 	 	are	authentic	.
two	,	it	's	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	be	authentic	if	you	do	n't	say	you	're	authentic	.
and	three	,	if	you	say	you	're	authentic	,	you	better	be	authentic	.
and	then	for	the	 consumer 	 s 	 	,	for	 every 	 one 	 	else	in	the	audience	,	let	me	 simpl 	 y 	 	summarize	it	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	what	we	--	what	will	make	us	happy	,	is	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	our	time	and	our	money	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	the	 desir 	 e 	 	for	 authentic 	 ity 	 	.
thank	you	.
