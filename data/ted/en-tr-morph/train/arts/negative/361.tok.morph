i	grew	up	in	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	,	right	up	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	north	end	of	it	there	,	where	it	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	freezing	cold	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	me	running	around	in	the	back	garden	mid	-	summer	.
i	could	n't	pick	a	 care 	 er 	 	.
in	ireland	the	obvious	choice	is	the	 militar 	 y 	 	,	but	to	be	honest	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	 suck 	 s 	 	.
my	mother	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	be	a	 dent 	 ist 	 	.
but	the	problem	was	that	people	 ke 	 pt 	 	 blow 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	up	.
so	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	to	school	in	belfast	,	which	was	where	all	the	action	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	common	sight	.
the	school	i	went	to	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
they	 force 	 d 	 	us	to	learn	 thing 	 s 	 	like	latin	.
the	school	 teacher 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 hav 	 ing 	 	much	 f 	 un 	 	,	the	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	or	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
so	i	 clever 	 ly 	 	chose	 row 	 ing 	 	,	which	i	got	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	.
and	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 row 	 ing 	 	for	my	school	here	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 fate 	 ful 	 	day	,	and	i	 flip 	 ped 	 	over	right	in	front	of	the	entire	school	.
and	that	was	the	 finish 	 ing 	 	post	right	there	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	.
but	our	school	at	that	time	got	a	grant	from	the	government	,	and	they	got	an	 in 	 credible 	 	computer	--	the	research	machine	3dz	--	and	they	left	the	 programm 	 ing 	 	 manual 	 s 	 	 ly 	 ing 	 	around	.
and	so	 student 	 s 	 	like	 my 	 self 	 	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	we	would	learn	how	to	program	it	.
 al 	 so 	 	around	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	at	home	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	computer	that	people	 we 	 re 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	the	sinclair	zx	80.	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	1k	computer	,	and	you	'd	buy	your	 program 	 s 	 	on	cassette	tape	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	i	'm	just	going	to	pause	for	one	second	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	heard	that	there	's	a	 pre 	 requisite 	 	to	speak	here	at	ted	--	you	had	to	have	a	picture	of	 your 	 self 	 	from	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	with	big	hair	.
so	i	 br 	 ought 	 	a	picture	with	big	hair	.
i	just	want	to	get	that	out	of	the	way	.
so	after	the	sinclair	zx	80	came	 a 	 long 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 clever 	 ly 	 	named	sinclair	zx	81	.
and	--	you	see	the	picture	at	the	bottom	?
there	's	a	picture	of	a	guy	 do 	 ing 	 	 home 	 work 	 	with	his	son	.
that	's	what	they	thought	they	had	built	it	for	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	we	got	the	 programm 	 ing 	 	manual	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 game 	 s 	 	for	it	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 programm 	 ing 	 	in	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	which	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	awful	language	for	 game 	 s 	 	,	so	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 learn 	 ing 	 	 assem 	 bly 	 	language	so	we	could	 re 	 ally 	 	take	control	of	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	guy	that	 invent 	 ed 	 	it	,	 s 	 ir 	 	clive	sinclair	,	and	he	's	 show 	 ing 	 	his	machine	.
you	had	 th 	 is 	 	same	thing	in	america	,	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	the	timex	sinclair1000	.
to	play	a	game	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	you	had	to	have	an	 imagin 	 ation 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	``	battlestar	galactica	.	``
the	 graphic 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	 horr 	 ible 	 	.
you	had	to	have	an	even	better	 imagin 	 ation 	 	to	play	 th 	 is 	 	game	,	``	death	rider	.	``
but	of	course	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	could	n't	help	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 the 	 ir 	 	own	video	 game 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 one 	 s 	 	here	,	where	they	have	 rabbi 	 t 	 	 breed 	 ing 	 	,	so	 male 	 s 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	the	 luck 	 y 	 	 rabbi 	 t 	 	.
it	was	around	 th 	 is 	 	time	we	went	from	1k	to	16k	,	which	was	 quit 	 e 	 	the	leap	.
and	if	you	're	 wonder 	 ing 	 	how	much	16k	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	ebay	logo	here	is	16k	.
and	in	that	amount	of	 memor 	 y 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 programm 	 ed 	 	a	full	flight	 simul 	 ation 	 	program	.
and	that	's	what	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	 age 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	flight	 simul 	 ator 	 	,	and	i	 honest 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	i	could	fly	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	by	the	end	of	it	.
here	's	clive	sinclair	now	 launch 	 ing 	 	his	color	computer	.
he	's	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	father	of	video	 game 	 s 	 	in	europe	.
he	's	a	multi	-	millionaire	,	and	i	think	that	's	why	he	's	 smil 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	.
so	i	went	on	for	the	next	20	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	making	a	lot	of	different	 game 	 s 	 	.
some	of	the	 high 	 light 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	``	the	terminator	,	``	``	aladdin	,	``	the	``	 teen 	 age 	 	 mut 	 ant 	 	hero	 turtle 	 s 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	,	they	thought	the	word	 n 	 in 	 ja 	 	was	a	little	too	mean	for	children	,	so	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	call	it	hero	 in 	 stead 	 	.
i	 personal 	 ly 	 	 prefer 	 red 	 	the	spanish	version	,	which	was	``	tortugas	 n 	 in 	 ja 	 	.	``
that	was	much	better	.
then	the	last	game	i	did	was	based	on	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	video	game	industry	and	hollywood	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	together	on	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 licens 	 ing 	 	from	each	other	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	.
now	,	chris	did	ask	me	to	 br 	 ing 	 	some	 statistic 	 s 	 	with	me	,	so	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	.
the	video	game	industry	in	2005	 be 	 came 	 	a	29	billion	dollar	business	.
it	 grow 	 s 	 	every	year	.
last	year	was	the	 big 	 gest 	 	year	.
by	2008	,	we	're	going	to	kick	the	butt	of	the	music	industry	.
by	2010	,	we	're	going	to	hit	42	billion	.
43	percent	of	 gam 	 ers 	 	are	female	.
so	there	's	a	lot	more	female	 gam 	 ers 	 	than	people	are	 re 	 ally 	 	aware	.
the	average	age	of	 gam 	 ers 	 	?
well	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	it	's	for	children	,	right	?
well	,	no	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	30	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	the	people	who	buy	the	most	 game 	 s 	 	are	37	.
so	37	is	our	target	audience	.
all	video	 game 	 s 	 	are	violent	.
of	course	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	love	to	beat	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	83	percent	of	 game 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	any	mature	content	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	,	so	it	's	just	not	true	.
 on 	 line 	 	 gam 	 ing 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
i	 br 	 ought 	 	some	stuff	on	``	world	of	warcraft	.	``	it	's	5.5	million	 player 	 s 	 	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	about	80	million	 buck 	 s 	 	a	month	in	 subscription 	 s 	 	.
it	 cost 	 s 	 	50	 buck 	 s 	 	just	to	install	it	on	your	computer	,	making	the	 publish 	 er 	 	about	 an 	 other 	 	275	million	.
the	game	 cost 	 s 	 	about	80	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	make	,	so	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	 pay 	 s 	 	for	 it 	 self 	 	in	about	a	month	.
a	player	in	a	game	 call 	 ed 	 	``	project	entropia	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	his	own	 is 	 land 	 	for	26,500	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
you	have	to	remember	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	real	 is 	 land 	 	.
he	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	buy	 any 	 thing 	 	,	just	some	data	.
but	he	got	great	 term 	 s 	 	on	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	purchase	 include 	 d 	 	 min 	 ing 	 	and	 hunt 	 ing 	 	 right 	 s 	 	,	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	all	land	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	,	and	a	castle	with	no	furniture	 include 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	market	is	now	 estimate 	 d 	 	at	over	800	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 annual 	 ly 	 	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	it	is	the	market	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	 gam 	 ers 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	found	clever	ways	to	trade	 item 	 s 	 	and	to	sell	 the 	 ir 	 	 account 	 s 	 	to	each	other	so	that	they	could	make	money	while	they	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 game 	 s 	 	.
i	dove	onto	ebay	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	ago	just	to	see	what	was	gong	on	,	 type 	 d 	 	in	world	of	warcraft	,	got	6,000	 item 	 s 	 	.
i	 like 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	the	best	:	a	level	60	warlock	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 epic 	 s 	 	for	174,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
it	's	like	that	guy	 obvious 	 ly 	 	had	some	pain	while	making	it	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	 popular 	 ity 	 	of	 game 	 s 	 	,	what	do	you	think	these	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	hollywood	bowl	in	los	angeles	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	l.a.	 phil 	 harmon 	 ic 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	video	game	music	.
that	's	what	the	show	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
you	would	expect	it	to	be	 che 	 es 	 y 	 	,	but	it	's	not	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	epic	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	concert	.
and	the	people	that	went	there	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 love 	 d 	 	it	.
what	do	you	think	these	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	?
they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	so	they	can	play	 game 	 s 	 	against	each	other	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	every	city	around	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	your	local	cities	too	,	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	just	not	aware	of	it	.
now	,	chris	told	me	that	you	had	a	 time 	 line 	 	video	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	here	just	to	show	how	video	game	 graphic 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 improv 	 ing 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	update	that	video	and	give	you	a	new	look	at	it	.
but	what	i	want	you	to	do	is	to	try	to	understand	it	.
we	're	on	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	and	the	 graphic 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	so	 ridicul 	 ously 	 	better	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	up	to	 may 	 be 	 	2007	.
but	i	want	you	to	try	and	think	about	what	 game 	 s 	 	could	look	like	10	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	.
so	we	're	going	to	start	that	video	.
video	:	 through 	 out 	 	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	people	have	 play 	 ed 	 	 game 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	man	's	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	and	technology	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	so	too	have	the	 game 	 s 	 	he	 play 	 s 	 	.
david	perry	:	the	thing	 aga 	 in 	 	i	want	you	to	think	about	is	,	do	n't	look	at	these	 graphic 	 s 	 	and	think	of	that	's	the	way	it	is	.
think	about	that	's	where	we	are	right	now	,	and	the	 curv 	 e 	 	that	we	're	on	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	get	better	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	kind	of	 graphic 	 s 	 	you	need	to	be	able	to	draw	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	a	job	in	the	video	game	industry	 to 	 day 	 	.
you	need	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	artist	.
and	once	we	get	 en 	 ough 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	want	more	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	that	can	create	 place 	 s 	 	we	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	to	before	,	or	 character 	 s 	 	that	we	've	just	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
so	the	obvious	thing	for	me	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	 graphic 	 s 	 	and	audio	.
but	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	go	to	a	game	 develop 	 ers 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	what	they	're	all	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	emotion	,	purpose	,	meaning	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
you	'll	hear	about	 talk 	 s 	 	like	,	can	a	video	game	make	you	cry	?
and	these	are	the	kind	of	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	care	about	.
i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	a	student	who	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 excel 	 lent 	 	at	 express 	 ing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	student	 agree 	 d 	 	that	he	would	not	show	his	video	to	 any 	 body 	 	 un 	 til 	 	you	here	at	ted	had	 s 	 een 	 	it	.
so	i	'd	like	to	play	 th 	 is 	 	video	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	student	's	opinion	on	what	his	experience	of	 game 	 s 	 	are	.
video	:	i	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	live	 some 	 where 	 	between	 re 	 ality 	 	and	video	 game 	 s 	 	.
some	part	of	me	--	a	true	living	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	person	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 programm 	 ed 	 	,	 electron 	 ic 	 	and	virtual	.
the	 bound 	 ary 	 	of	my	brain	that	 divide 	 s 	 	real	from	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	to	 crumb 	 le 	 	.
i	'm	a	video	game	addict	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	story	.
in	the	year	of	my	birth	the	nintendo	 entertain 	 ment 	 	system	 al 	 so 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
i	 play 	 ed 	 	in	the	 back 	 yard 	 	,	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	read	,	and	even	ate	some	of	my	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	.
most	of	my	 child 	 hood 	 	was	 s 	 pent 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	legos	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	was	the	case	for	most	of	my	generation	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	front	of	the	tv	.
mr.	rogers	,	walt	disney	,	nick	 juni 	 or 	 	,	and	 rough 	 ly 	 	half	a	million	 commercial 	 s 	 	have	 un 	 doubt 	 ed 	 ly 	 	left	 the 	 ir 	 	mark	on	me	.
when	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	my	sister	and	i	our	first	nintendo	,	 what 	 ever 	 	inherent	 addict 	 ive 	 	quality	 th 	 is 	 	early	 inter 	 active 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	 entertain 	 ment 	 	 possess 	 ed 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	took	hold	of	me	.
at	some	point	 some 	 thing 	 	 click 	 ed 	 	.
with	the	combination	of	simple	,	 inter 	 active 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	and	the	 warm 	 th 	 	of	the	tv	set	,	my	simple	16	-	bit	nintendo	 be 	 came 	 	more	than	just	an	 es 	 cape 	 	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	an	alternate	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	my	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	.
i	'm	a	video	game	addict	,	and	it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	certain	number	of	 hour 	 s 	 	i	have	 s 	 pent 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	,	or	 night 	 s 	 	i	have	gone	 with 	 out 	 	sleep	to	finish	the	next	level	.
it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	had	life	-	 alter 	 ing 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	in	virtual	space	,	and	video	 game 	 s 	 	had	 beg 	 un 	 	to	erode	my	own	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	what	is	real	and	what	is	not	.
i	'm	 addict 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	know	i	'm	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	my	grip	on	 re 	 ality 	 	,	i	still	 crav 	 e 	 	more	.
from	an	early	age	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	invest	 my 	 self 	 	 emotion 	 ally 	 	in	what	 un 	 fold 	 ed 	 	before	me	on	screen	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	after	20	 year 	 s 	 	of	 watch 	 ing 	 	tv	 gear 	 ed 	 	to	make	me	 emotion 	 al 	 	,	even	a	 de 	 cent 	 	 insur 	 ance 	 	commercial	can	 br 	 ing 	 	 tear 	 s 	 	to	my	 eye 	 s 	 	.
i	am	just	one	of	a	new	generation	that	is	growing	up	.
a	generation	who	may	experience	much	more	meaning	through	video	 game 	 s 	 	than	they	will	through	the	real	world	.
video	 game 	 s 	 	are	 near 	 ing 	 	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	leap	,	a	point	where	game	 world 	 s 	 	will	look	and	feel	just	 a 	 s 	 	real	 a 	 s 	 	the	 film 	 s 	 	we	see	in	 theatre 	 s 	 	,	or	the	news	we	watch	on	tv	.
and	while	my	sense	of	free	will	in	these	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	may	still	be	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	what	i	do	learn	 appli 	 es 	 	to	my	real	life	.
play	 en 	 ough 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	you	will	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	you	can	 snow 	 board 	 	,	fly	a	plane	,	drive	a	nine	-	second	quarter	mile	,	or	kill	a	man	.
i	know	i	can	.
 un 	 like 	 	any	pop	culture	 phenomen 	 on 	 	before	it	,	video	 game 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	allow	us	to	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	machine	.
they	allow	us	to	sublimate	 in 	 to 	 	the	culture	of	 inter 	 active 	 	,	 download 	 ed 	 	,	 stream 	 ing 	 	,	hd	 re 	 ality 	 	.
we	are	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	our	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
i	have	come	to	expect	 th 	 is 	 	level	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	it	,	the	 problem 	 s 	 	 face 	 d 	 	in	the	real	world	--	poverty	,	war	,	disease	and	genocide	--	lack	the	 levit 	 y 	 	they	should	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	 blend 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 sensational 	 ized 	 	drama	of	prime	time	tv	.
but	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	video	 game 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	lies	not	in	the	 life 	 like 	 	 graphic 	 s 	 	,	the	 vib 	 rating 	 	 joy 	 stick 	 s 	 	or	virtual	surround	sound	.
it	lies	in	that	these	 game 	 s 	 	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	make	me	 emotion 	 al 	 	.
i	have	 f 	 ought 	 	in	 war 	 s 	 	,	 fear 	 ed 	 	for	my	own	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	 watch 	 ed 	 	my	 cohort 	 s 	 	die	on	 beach 	 es 	 	and	 wood 	 s 	 	that	look	and	feel	more	real	than	any	 text 	 book 	 	or	any	news	story	.
the	people	who	create	these	 game 	 s 	 	are	smart	.
they	know	what	 make 	 s 	 	me	 scar 	 ed 	 	,	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	 panic 	 ked 	 	,	proud	or	 s 	 ad 	 	.
then	they	use	these	 emotion 	 s 	 	to	 dimensional 	 ize 	 	the	 world 	 s 	 	they	create	.
a	well	-	designed	video	game	will	 seam 	 lessly 	 	weave	the	user	 in 	 to 	 	the	fabric	of	the	virtual	experience	.
 a 	 s 	 	one	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	 experience 	 d 	 	the	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	physical	control	 melt 	 s 	 	away	.
i	know	what	i	want	and	i	do	it	.
no	 button 	 s 	 	to	push	,	no	 trigger 	 s 	 	to	pull	,	just	me	and	the	game	.
my	fate	and	the	fate	of	the	world	around	me	lie	 in 	 side 	 	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
i	know	violent	video	 game 	 s 	 	make	my	mother	worry	.
what	 trouble 	 s 	 	me	is	not	that	video	game	violence	is	 be 	 coming 	 	more	and	more	like	real	life	violence	,	but	that	real	life	violence	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	look	more	and	more	like	a	video	game	.
these	are	all	 trouble 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	have	a	problem	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	home	.
 some 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	my	brain	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	is	a	single	part	of	our	brain	that	 hold 	 s 	 	all	of	our	gut	 instinct 	 s 	 	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	know	to	do	before	we	even	think	.
while	some	of	these	 instinct 	 s 	 	may	be	innate	,	most	are	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	and	all	of	them	are	 hard 	 wired 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
these	 instinct 	 s 	 	are	essential	for	 surviv 	 al 	 	in	both	real	and	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	technology	 be 	 hind 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	for	a	true	 over 	 lap 	 	in	 stimul 	 i 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 gam 	 ers 	 	we	are	now	living	by	the	same	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	in	the	same	cities	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	we	once	did	in	real	life	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 virtual 	 ly 	 	.
consider	 th 	 is 	 	--	my	real	life	car	 ha 	 s 	 	about	25,000	 mile 	 s 	 	on	it	.
in	all	my	 driv 	 ing 	 	 game 	 s 	 	,	i	've	driven	a	total	of	31,459	 mile 	 s 	 	.
to	some	degree	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	drive	from	the	game	.
the	 sensor 	 y 	 	 cue 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	.
it	's	a	funny	 feel 	 ing 	 	when	you	have	 s 	 pent 	 	more	time	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	on	the	tv	than	you	have	in	real	life	.
when	i	am	 driv 	 ing 	 	down	a	road	at	 s 	 un 	 set 	 	all	i	can	think	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	my	 game 	 s 	 	are	.
for	my	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	are	perfect	.
more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	rich	than	the	real	world	around	us	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	what	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	my	experience	are	,	but	the	potential	for	using	realistic	video	game	 stimul 	 i 	 	in	 re 	 petition 	 	on	a	vast	number	of	loyal	 particip 	 ants 	 	is	 frighten 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
 to 	 day 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	big	brother	would	find	much	more	success	 brain 	 wash 	 ing 	 	the	 masse 	 s 	 	with	video	 game 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	tvs	.
video	 game 	 s 	 	are	 f 	 un 	 	,	 engag 	 ing 	 	,	and	 leav 	 e 	 	your	brain	 complete 	 ly 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	re	-	 programm 	 ing 	 	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	 brain 	 wash 	 ing 	 	is	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	bad	.
imagine	a	game	that	 teach 	 es 	 	us	to	respect	each	other	,	or	 help 	 s 	 	us	to	understand	the	 problem 	 s 	 	we	're	all	facing	in	the	real	world	.
there	is	a	potential	to	do	good	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
it	is	critical	,	 a 	 s 	 	these	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	mirror	the	real	world	we	live	in	,	that	game	 develop 	 ers 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	that	they	have	tremendous	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	before	them	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	what	the	future	of	video	 game 	 s 	 	 hold 	 s 	 	for	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	virtual	and	real	world	 experience 	 s 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 over 	 lap 	 	there	is	a	 great 	 er 	 	and	 great 	 er 	 	potential	for	other	people	to	feel	the	same	way	i	do	.
what	i	have	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	come	to	 real 	 ize 	 	is	that	beyond	the	 graphic 	 s 	 	,	sound	,	game	play	and	emotion	it	is	the	power	to	break	down	 re 	 ality 	 	that	is	so	 fasci 	 nating 	 	and	 addict 	 ive 	 	to	me	.
i	know	that	i	am	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	my	grip	.
part	of	me	is	just	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	let	go	.
i	know	 th 	 ough 	 	,	that	no	matter	how	 amaz 	 ing 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	may	 be 	 come 	 	,	or	how	flat	the	real	world	may	seem	to	us	,	that	we	must	stay	aware	of	what	our	 game 	 s 	 	are	 teach 	 ing 	 	us	and	how	they	 leav 	 e 	 	us	 feel 	 ing 	 	when	we	 final 	 ly 	 	do	 un 	 plug 	 	.
dp	:	 w 	 ow 	 	.
i	found	that	video	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	thought	 provok 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	's	why	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	here	for	you	 guy 	 s 	 	to	see	.
and	what	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	it	is	the	obvious	choice	for	me	to	talk	about	was	 graphic 	 s 	 	and	audio	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	heard	,	michael	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	all	these	other	 element 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
video	 game 	 s 	 	give	an	awful	lot	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	too	,	and	that	's	why	people	get	so	 addict 	 ed 	 	.
the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	one	 be 	 ing 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.
the	name	of	 th 	 is 	 	track	is	``	the	magic	to	come	.	``
who	is	that	going	to	come	from	?
is	it	going	to	come	from	the	best	 director 	 s 	 	in	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	we	thought	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	?
i	do	n't	think	so	.
i	think	it	's	going	to	come	from	the	children	who	are	growing	up	now	that	are	n't	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	all	of	the	stuff	that	we	remember	from	the	past	.
they	're	going	to	do	it	 the 	 ir 	 	way	,	using	the	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	.
the	same	with	 student 	 s 	 	or	 high 	 ly 	 	creative	people	,	 writer 	 s 	 	and	people	like	that	.
 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	 college 	 s 	 	go	,	there	's	about	350	 college 	 s 	 	around	the	world	 teach 	 ing 	 	video	game	 course 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	there	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
some	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 dread 	 ful 	 	and	some	of	them	are	great	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	listen	to	 some 	 one 	 	try	and	pitch	you	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	video	game	idea	.
chris	anderson	:	you	're	off	,	you	're	off	.	that	's	it	.
he	's	out	of	time	.
dp	:	i	've	just	got	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	bit	more	if	you	'll	indulge	me	.
ca	:	go	 a 	 head 	 	.	i	'm	going	to	stay	right	here	 th 	 ough 	 	.
dp	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	cool	shot	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 student 	 s 	 	coming	to	school	after	class	.
the	school	is	closed	;	they	're	coming	back	at	 mid 	 night 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	to	pitch	 the 	 ir 	 	video	game	 idea 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	the	front	of	the	class	,	and	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pitch 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	hard	to	get	 student 	 s 	 	to	come	back	to	class	,	but	it	is	possible	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	daughter	,	her	name	's	emma	,	she	's	17	 month 	 s 	 	old	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	what	is	emma	going	to	experience	in	the	video	game	world	?
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	here	,	we	have	the	audience	.
she	's	never	going	to	know	a	world	where	you	ca	n't	press	a	button	and	have	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	ready	to	play	.
you	know	,	we	have	the	technology	.
she	's	never	going	to	know	a	world	where	the	 graphic 	 s 	 	just	are	n't	 stunn 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 immers 	 ive 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	student	video	 show 	 ed 	 	,	we	can	impact	and	move	.
she	's	never	going	to	know	a	world	where	video	 game 	 s 	 	are	n't	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	and	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	make	her	cry	.
i	just	hope	she	 like 	 s 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	.
so	,	my	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	thought	.
 game 	 s 	 	on	the	surface	seem	simple	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	but	for	 t 	 hose 	 	that	like	to	look	a	little	 deep 	 er 	 	,	the	new	paradigm	of	video	 game 	 s 	 	could	open	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	to	creative	 mind 	 s 	 	that	like	to	think	big	.
where	better	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	than	here	at	ted	?
thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	david	perry	.	that	was	awesome	.
