when	i	'm	 start 	 ing 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	 usual 	 ly 	 	do	a	whole	 spi 	 el 	 	about	 sustain 	 ability 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	a	lot	of	people	out	there	do	n't	know	what	that	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	crowd	that	 do 	 es 	 	know	what	it	is	,	so	i	'll	like	just	do	like	the	60	-	second	crib	-	note	version	.	right	?
so	just	bear	with	me	.	we	'll	go	real	fast	,	you	know	?
fill	in	the	 blank 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	know	,	 sustain 	 ability 	 	,	small	planet	.
right	?	picture	a	little	earth	,	 circl 	 ing 	 	around	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
you	know	,	about	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	bunch	of	 monkey 	 s 	 	fell	out	of	 tree 	 s 	 	,	got	a	little	clever	,	 harness 	 ed 	 	fire	,	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	made	,	you	know	,	 lugg 	 age 	 	with	 wheel 	 s 	 	on	it	.
and	,	you	know	,	built	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	we	now	live	in	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	while	 th 	 is 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	doubt	,	the	most	 prosper 	 ous 	 	and	dynamic	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 create 	 d 	 	,	it	's	got	some	major	,	major	 flaw 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	is	that	every	 socie 	 ty 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 eco 	 logical 	 	 foot 	 print 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	amount	of	impact	on	the	planet	that	's	 measur 	 able 	 	.
how	much	stuff	 go 	 es 	 	through	your	life	,	how	much	waste	is	left	 be 	 hind 	 	you	.
and	we	,	at	the	moment	,	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	level	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	're	using	up	about	five	 planet 	 s 	 	.
if	 every 	 body 	 	on	the	planet	lived	the	way	we	did	,	we	'd	need	between	five	,	six	,	seven	,	some	people	even	say	10	 planet 	 s 	 	to	make	it	.
 clear 	 ly 	 	we	do	n't	have	10	 planet 	 s 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	know	,	mental	,	visual	,	10	 planet 	 s 	 	,	one	planet	,	10	 planet 	 s 	 	,	one	planet	.	right	?
we	do	n't	have	that	.	so	that	's	one	problem	.
the	second	problem	is	that	the	planet	that	we	have	is	 be 	 ing 	 	used	in	 wild 	 ly 	 	 un 	 fair 	 	ways	.	right	?
north	americans	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	you	know	,	we	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	sort	of	 wall 	 ow 	 ing 	 	,	 glut 	 ton 	 ous 	 	 hog 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	eating	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
and	,	you	know	,	then	you	get	all	the	way	down	to	people	who	live	in	the	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	-	 pac 	 ific 	 	region	,	or	even	more	,	africa	.
and	people	 simpl 	 y 	 	do	not	have	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	producing	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 tension 	 s 	 	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 dynamic 	 s 	 	that	are	 deep 	 ly 	 	 disturb 	 ing 	 	.
and	there	's	more	and	more	people	on	the	way	.	right	?
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	planet	's	going	to	look	like	in	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	going	to	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 crowd 	 ed 	 	place	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	eight	billion	people	.
so	to	make	 matter 	 s 	 	even	more	difficult	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	young	planet	.
a	third	of	the	people	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	are	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	growing	up	in	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	way	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	did	,	no	matter	where	they	live	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	of	our	 prosper 	 ity 	 	.
and	they	may	not	want	to	live	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	us	.
they	may	not	want	to	be	americans	,	or	brits	,	or	germans	,	or	south	africans	,	but	they	want	 the 	 ir 	 	own	version	of	a	life	which	is	more	 prosper 	 ous 	 	,	and	more	dynamic	,	and	more	,	you	know	,	 enjoy 	 able 	 	.
and	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	combine	to	create	an	enormous	amount	of	 tor 	 que 	 	on	the	planet	.
and	if	we	can	not	figure	out	a	way	to	deal	with	that	 tor 	 que 	 	,	we	are	going	to	find	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	more	and	more	and	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	facing	 situ 	 ations 	 	which	are	 simpl 	 y 	 	 un 	 think 	 able 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 ha 	 s 	 	heard	the	worst	-	case	 scenario 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	need	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
but	i	will	ask	the	question	,	what	's	the	 alter 	 native 	 	?
and	i	would	say	that	,	at	the	moment	,	the	 alter 	 native 	 	is	 un 	 imagin 	 able 	 	.
you	know	,	so	on	the	one	hand	we	have	the	 un 	 think 	 able 	 	;	on	the	other	hand	we	have	the	 un 	 imagin 	 able 	 	.
we	do	n't	know	yet	how	to	build	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	which	is	 environment 	 ally 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	which	is	 share 	 able 	 	with	 every 	 body 	 	on	the	planet	,	which	 promote 	 s 	 	 st 	 ability 	 	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	human	 right 	 s 	 	,	and	which	is	 achiev 	 able 	 	in	the	time	-	frame	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	make	it	through	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	we	face	.
we	do	n't	know	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	yet	.
so	what	's	worldchanging	?
well	,	worldchanging	you	might	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	bit	of	a	news	service	for	the	 un 	 imagin 	 able 	 	future	.
you	know	,	what	we	're	out	there	 do 	 ing 	 	is	looking	for	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 tool 	 s 	 	,	 model 	 s 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	,	which	,	if	 wide 	 ly 	 	 adopt 	 ed 	 	,	would	change	the	game	.
a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	when	i	do	a	talk	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	heard	of	,	but	most	people	have	n't	.
so	i	thought	 to 	 day 	 	i	'd	do	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	different	,	and	talk	about	what	we	're	looking	for	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	giving	you	 tri 	 ed 	 	-	and	-	true	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
talk	about	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	 s 	 cop 	 ing 	 	out	.
give	you	a	little	peek	 in 	 to 	 	our	 editor 	 ial 	 	 note 	 book 	 	.
and	 give 	 n 	 	that	i	have	13	 minute 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	go	kind	of	quick	.
so	,	i	do	n't	know	,	just	stick	with	me	.	right	?
so	,	first	of	all	,	what	are	we	looking	for	?	bright	green	city	.
one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 lever 	 s 	 	that	we	have	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	for	changing	the	impact	that	we	have	on	the	planet	is	changing	the	way	that	we	live	in	cities	.
we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	an	urban	planet	;	that	's	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	true	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	.
and	people	who	live	in	cities	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	tend	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 prosper 	 ous 	 	,	and	thus	use	a	lot	of	stuff	.
if	we	can	change	the	dynamic	,	by	first	of	all	creating	cities	that	are	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	and	more	 liv 	 able 	 	...
here	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	vancouver	,	which	if	you	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	you	ought	to	go	for	a	visit	.	it	's	a	fabulous	city	.
and	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	density	,	new	density	,	better	than	 prob 	 ably 	 	 any 	 body 	 	else	on	the	planet	right	now	.
they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 man 	 aging 	 	to	talk	north	americans	out	of	 driv 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	great	thing	.
so	you	have	density	.	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	growth	management	.
you	 leav 	 e 	 	 a 	 side 	 	what	is	natural	to	be	natural	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	portland	.	that	is	an	actual	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
that	land	there	will	remain	 past 	 ure 	 	in	 perpetu 	 ity 	 	.
they	've	 bound 	 ed 	 	the	city	with	a	line	.
nature	,	city	.	 noth 	 ing 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
once	you	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	can	start	making	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 invest 	 ments 	 	.
you	can	start	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	you	know	,	transit	 system 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	to	transport	people	,	in	effective	and	 reason 	 ably 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 manner 	 s 	 	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	start	to	change	what	you	build	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	beddington	zero	energy	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	london	,	which	is	one	of	the	 green 	 est 	 	 building 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.	it	's	a	fabulous	place	.
we	're	able	to	now	build	 building 	 s 	 	that	generate	all	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	that	 re 	 cycle 	 	much	of	 the 	 ir 	 	water	,	that	are	much	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	than	standard	 building 	 s 	 	,	use	all	-	natural	light	,	etc	.	,	and	,	over	time	,	cost	less	.
green	 roof 	 s 	 	.	bill	mcdonough	 cover 	 ed 	 	that	last	night	,	so	i	wo	n't	 d 	 well 	 	on	that	too	much	.
but	once	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	people	living	in	close	 proxim 	 ity 	 	to	each	other	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	is	--	 a 	 s 	 	information	 techno 	 logies 	 	develop	--	you	can	start	to	have	smart	 place 	 s 	 	.
you	can	start	to	know	where	 thing 	 s 	 	are	.
when	you	know	where	 thing 	 s 	 	are	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	share	them	.
when	you	share	them	,	you	end	up	using	less	.
so	one	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	car	-	share	 club 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	take	off	in	the	u.s.	,	have	 al 	 ready 	 	taken	off	in	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	in	europe	,	and	are	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
if	you	're	 some 	 body 	 	who	 drive 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	one	day	a	week	,	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	need	your	own	car	?
 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	information	technology	lets	us	do	is	start	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	use	less	stuff	by	 know 	 ing 	 	,	and	by	 monitor 	 ing 	 	,	the	amount	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	using	.
so	,	here	's	a	power	cord	which	 glow 	 s 	 	 bright 	 er 	 	the	more	energy	that	you	use	,	which	i	think	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	think	it	ought	to	work	the	other	way	around	,	that	it	 get 	 s 	 	 bright 	 er 	 	the	more	you	do	n't	use	.
but	,	you	know	,	there	may	even	be	a	 simpl 	 er 	 	approach	.
we	could	just	re	-	label	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	light	 s 	 witch 	 	that	 read 	 s 	 	,	on	the	one	hand	,	 flash 	 flood 	 s 	 	,	and	on	the	other	hand	,	off	.
how	we	build	 thing 	 s 	 	can	change	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bio	-	morphic	building	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	inspiration	in	form	from	life	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 building 	 s 	 	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	much	more	effective	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	bio	-	mimicry	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	look	a	lot	more	for	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	you	have	a	shell	design	which	was	used	to	create	a	new	kind	of	exhaust	fan	,	which	is	 great 	 ly 	 	more	effective	.
there	's	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 happen 	 ing 	 	;	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	.
i	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	look	on	worldchanging	if	you	're	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	cover	 th 	 is 	 	more	and	more	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	neo	-	 bio 	 logical 	 	design	,	where	more	and	more	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	using	life	 it 	 self 	 	and	the	 process 	 es 	 	of	life	to	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	our	industry	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	hydrogen	-	generating	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	.
so	we	have	a	model	in	potential	,	an	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	model	that	we	're	looking	for	of	how	to	take	the	cities	most	of	us	live	in	,	and	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	bright	green	cities	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	most	of	the	people	on	the	planet	do	n't	live	in	the	 cite 	 s 	 	we	live	in	.
they	live	in	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 mega 	 cities 	 	of	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
and	there	's	a	statistic	i	often	like	to	use	,	which	is	that	we	're	 add 	 ing 	 	a	city	of	seattle	every	four	 day 	 s 	 	,	a	city	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	seattle	to	the	planet	every	four	 day 	 s 	 	.
i	was	giving	a	talk	about	two	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	who	'd	 d 	 one 	 	some	work	with	the	u.n.	,	came	up	to	me	and	was	 re 	 ally 	 	flustered	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	look	,	you	've	got	that	 total 	 ly 	 	wrong	;	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
it	's	every	seven	 day 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	're	 add 	 ing 	 	a	city	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	seattle	every	seven	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	cities	look	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	than	the	city	that	you	or	i	live	in	.
most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 cite 	 s 	 	are	growing	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
they	do	n't	have	 exist 	 ing 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	;	they	have	enormous	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	poverty	,	and	enormous	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	in	new	ways	.
so	what	do	we	need	in	order	to	make	 develop 	 ing 	 	nation	 mega 	 cities 	 	 in 	 to 	 	bright	green	 mega 	 cities 	 	?
well	,	the	first	thing	we	need	is	,	we	need	 leapfrog 	 ging 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	are	looking	for	 every 	 where 	 	.
the	idea	 be 	 hind 	 	 leapfrog 	 ging 	 	is	that	if	you	are	a	person	,	or	a	country	,	who	is	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	you	do	n't	have	the	 tool 	 s 	 	and	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	you	need	,	there	's	no	reason	for	you	to	invest	in	last	generation	's	 techno 	 logies 	 	.	right	?
that	you	're	much	better	off	,	 al 	 most 	 	 universal 	 ly 	 	,	looking	for	a	low	-	cost	or	 local 	 ly 	 	 appli 	 cable 	 	version	of	the	 new 	 est 	 	technology	.
one	place	we	're	all	familiar	with	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	with	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	.	right	?
all	 through 	 out 	 	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	people	are	going	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	,	 skip 	 ping 	 	the	whole	 land 	 line 	 	stage	.
if	there	are	 land 	 lines 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	cities	,	they	're	 usual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 crap 	 py 	 	 system 	 s 	 	that	break	down	a	lot	and	cost	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	money	.
so	i	 ra 	 ther 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	picture	here	.
i	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	like	the	ganesh	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	on	the	cell	phone	.
so	what	we	have	,	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	is	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	just	 perm 	 eating 	 	out	through	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
we	've	heard	all	about	 th 	 is 	 	here	 th 	 is 	 	week	,	so	i	wo	n't	say	too	much	more	than	that	,	other	than	to	say	what	is	true	for	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	is	true	for	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
the	second	thing	is	 tool 	 s 	 	for	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	be	they	 system 	 s 	 	of	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	or	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	 system 	 s 	 	which	 encourag 	 e 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.	right	?
when	you	have	free	ability	for	people	to	 free 	 ly 	 	work	together	and	 innov 	 ate 	 	,	you	get	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 solution 	 s 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	are	 access 	 ible 	 	in	a	different	way	to	people	who	do	n't	have	capital	.	right	?
so	,	you	know	,	we	have	open	source	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	we	have	creative	 common 	 s 	 	and	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	copyleft	 solution 	 s 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	lead	to	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	telecentro	in	sao	paulo	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	program	using	free	and	open	source	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	cheap	,	sort	of	 hack 	 ed 	 	-	together	 machine 	 s 	 	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	sort	of	 abandon 	 ed 	 	 building 	 s 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	put	together	a	bunch	of	community	 center 	 s 	 	where	people	can	come	in	,	get	high	-	speed	 inter 	 net 	 	access	,	learn	computer	 programm 	 ing 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	for	free	.
and	a	quarter	-	million	people	every	year	use	these	now	in	sao	paulo	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	quarter	-	million	people	are	some	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	people	in	sao	paolo	.
i	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	like	the	little	linux	penguin	in	the	back	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	that	's	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	is	a	sort	of	southern	cultural	explosion	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	at	worldchanging	is	the	ways	in	which	the	south	is	re	-	 identify 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	re	-	 categor 	 izing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	ways	that	have	less	and	less	to	do	with	most	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
so	it	's	not	,	you	know	,	bollywood	is	n't	just	 answer 	 ing 	 	hollywood	.	right	?
you	know	,	brazilian	music	scene	is	n't	just	 answer 	 ing 	 	the	major	 label 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.	there	's	new	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	 inter 	 play 	 	between	them	.	and	,	you	know	,	you	get	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
like	,	i	do	n't	know	if	any	of	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	movie	``	city	of	god	?	``
 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	a	fabulous	movie	if	you	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	it	.
and	it	's	all	about	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 art 	 istic 	 	and	 in 	 direct 	 	kind	of	way	.
you	have	other	radical	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	where	the	ability	to	use	cultural	 tool 	 s 	 	is	 spread 	 ing 	 	out	.
these	are	people	who	have	just	 be 	 en 	 	 visit 	 ed 	 	by	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 book 	 mobile 	 	in	uganda	.
and	who	are	 wav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 book 	 s 	 	in	the	air	,	which	,	i	just	think	that	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	picture	.	you	know	?
so	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	ability	for	people	to	start	coming	together	and	 act 	 ing 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 be 	 half 	 	in	 politic 	 al 	 	and	civic	ways	,	in	ways	that	have	n't	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	last	night	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	week	,	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	vital	to	the	ability	to	craft	new	 solution 	 s 	 	,	is	we	've	got	to	craft	new	 politic 	 al 	 	 real 	 ities 	 	.
and	i	would	 personal 	 ly 	 	say	that	we	have	to	craft	new	 politic 	 al 	 	 real 	 ities 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	india	,	afghanistan	,	kenya	,	pakistan	,	what	have	you	,	but	here	at	home	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 an 	 other 	 	world	is	possible	.
and	sort	of	the	big	 mot 	 to 	 	of	the	anti	-	 global 	 ization 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.	right	?
we	tweak	that	a	lot	.
we	talk	about	how	 an 	 other 	 	world	is	n't	just	possible	;	 an 	 other 	 	world	's	here	.
that	it	's	not	just	that	we	have	to	sort	of	imagine	there	 be 	 ing 	 	a	different	,	vague	 possibil 	 ity 	 	out	there	,	but	we	need	to	start	 act 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	more	on	that	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
we	need	to	start	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	lula	,	 p 	 resident 	 	of	brazil	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	 k 	 new 	 	of	lula	before	 to 	 day 	 	?
ok	,	so	,	much	,	much	better	than	the	average	crowd	,	i	can	tell	you	that	.
so	lula	,	he	's	full	of	 problem 	 s 	 	,	full	of	 contradict 	 ions 	 	,	but	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	he	is	 put 	 ting 	 	forward	an	idea	of	how	we	engage	in	 inter 	 national 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	that	 complete 	 ly 	 	 shift 	 s 	 	the	balance	from	the	standard	sort	of	north	-	south	 dial 	 ogue 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	whole	new	way	of	global	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
i	would	keep	your	eye	on	 th 	 is 	 	fellow	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	second	 super 	 power 	 	thing	is	the	rise	of	these	 game 	 s 	 	that	are	what	we	call	``	serious	play	.	``
we	're	looking	a	lot	at	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 spread 	 ing 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	``	a	force	more	 power 	 ful 	 	.	``	it	's	a	little	 screen 	 shot 	 	.
``	a	force	more	 power 	 ful 	 	``	is	a	video	game	that	,	while	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	 teach 	 es 	 	you	how	to	engage	in	non	-	violent	 insur 	 re 	 ction 	 	and	regime	change	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	game	 call 	 ed 	 	``	food	force	,	``	which	is	a	game	that	 teach 	 es 	 	children	how	to	run	a	 refuge 	 e 	 	camp	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	all	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	dynamic	way	to	a	huge	rise	in	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	in	people	's	interest	in	and	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
we	get	so	little	news	about	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	that	we	often	forget	that	there	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	out	there	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	change	 thing 	 s 	 	to	be	 fair 	 er 	 	,	 free 	 r 	 	,	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	,	less	corrupt	.
and	,	you	know	,	we	do	n't	hear	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.
but	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	place	,	and	these	 tool 	 s 	 	are	part	of	what	's	making	it	possible	.
now	when	you	add	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	,	when	you	add	together	 leapfrog 	 ging 	 	and	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 tool 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	second	 super 	 power 	 	stuff	,	etc	.	,	what	do	you	get	?
well	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	you	get	a	bright	green	future	for	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
you	get	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	green	power	spread	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	.

these	are	 refrige 	 rator 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	no	 electric 	 ity 	 	;	they	're	pot	 with 	 in 	 	a	pot	design	.
and	you	get	water	 solution 	 s 	 	.	water	's	one	of	the	most	 press 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
here	's	a	design	for	 harvest 	 ing 	 	 rain 	 water 	 	that	's	super	cheap	and	 avail 	 able 	 	to	people	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.

i	just	love	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	--	i	mean	 carry 	 ing 	 	water	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	drag	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	just	came	up	with	the	idea	of	well	,	what	if	you	 roll 	 ed 	 	it	.	right	?
i	mean	,	that	's	a	great	design	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fabulous	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	lifestraw	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	you	can	suck	any	water	through	 th 	 is 	 	and	it	will	 be 	 come 	 	 drink 	 able 	 	by	the	time	it	 hit 	 s 	 	your	lips	.
