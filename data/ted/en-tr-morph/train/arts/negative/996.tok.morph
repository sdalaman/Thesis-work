i	love	video	 game 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	in	awe	of	them	.
i	'm	in	awe	of	 the 	 ir 	 	power	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	technology	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 cept 	 	.
but	i	think	,	above	all	,	i	'm	in	awe	at	 the 	 ir 	 	power	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	,	to	compel	us	,	to	 trans 	 fix 	 	us	,	like	 re 	 ally 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	we	've	ever	 invent 	 ed 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 d 	 one 	 	before	.
and	i	think	that	we	can	learn	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	by	looking	at	how	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	i	think	we	can	learn	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
now	the	video	 game 	 s 	 	industry	is	far	and	away	the	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	of	all	modern	media	.
from	about	10	billion	in	1990	,	it	's	worth	50	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	it	 show 	 s 	 	no	sign	of	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	.
in	four	 year 	 s 	 	'	time	,	it	's	 estimate 	 d 	 	it	'll	be	worth	over	80	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
that	's	about	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	 record 	 ed 	 	music	industry	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 stunn 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	do	n't	think	it	's	the	most	 tell 	 ing 	 	statistic	of	all	.
the	thing	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaze 	 s 	 	me	is	that	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	people	 s 	 pend 	 	about	eight	billion	real	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	 buy 	 ing 	 	virtual	 item 	 s 	 	that	 on 	 ly 	 	exist	 in 	 side 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 screen 	 shot 	 	from	the	virtual	game	world	,	entropia	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	a	virtual	 a 	 steroid 	 	in	it	 s 	 old 	 	for	330,000	real	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	titan	class	ship	in	the	space	game	,	eve	 on 	 line 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	virtual	object	 take 	 s 	 	200	real	people	about	56	 day 	 s 	 	of	real	time	to	build	,	plus	 count 	 less 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	effort	before	that	.
and	yet	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	get	built	.
at	the	other	end	of	the	scale	,	the	game	farmville	that	you	may	well	have	heard	of	,	 ha 	 s 	 	70	million	 player 	 s 	 	around	the	world	and	most	of	these	 player 	 s 	 	are	 play 	 ing 	 	it	 al 	 most 	 	every	day	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	all	sound	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 alarm 	 ing 	 	to	some	people	,	an	index	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 	or	wrong	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
but	we	're	here	for	the	good	news	,	and	the	good	news	is	that	i	think	we	can	explore	why	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	real	human	effort	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	generation	of	value	,	is	 occur 	 ring 	 	.
and	by	 answer 	 ing 	 	that	question	,	i	think	we	can	take	 some 	 thing 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	away	.
and	i	think	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	way	to	think	about	how	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	on	is	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 reward 	 s 	 	.
and	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 reward 	 s 	 	that	 play 	 ing 	 	 game 	 s 	 	 off 	 ers 	 	to	people	both	 individual 	 ly 	 	and	 collect 	 ively 	 	.
now	if	we	look	at	what	's	going	on	in	 some 	 one 	 	's	head	when	they	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	,	two	 quit 	 e 	 	different	 process 	 es 	 	are	 occur 	 ring 	 	.
on	the	one	hand	,	there	's	the	 want 	 ing 	 	 process 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bit	like	 ambit 	 ion 	 	and	drive	--	i	'm	going	to	do	that	.	i	'm	going	to	work	hard	.
on	the	other	hand	,	there	's	the	 lik 	 ing 	 	 process 	 es 	 	,	 f 	 un 	 	and	 affect 	 ion 	 	and	 de 	 light 	 	and	an	enormous	 fly 	 ing 	 	beast	with	an	orc	on	the	back	.
it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	image	.	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.
it	's	from	the	game	world	of	warcraft	with	more	than	10	million	 player 	 s 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	whom	is	me	,	 an 	 other 	 	of	whom	is	my	wife	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	a	world	,	 th 	 is 	 	vast	 fly 	 ing 	 	beast	you	can	ride	around	,	 show 	 s 	 	why	 game 	 s 	 	are	so	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 do 	 ing 	 	both	the	 want 	 ing 	 	and	the	 lik 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	awesome	.
it	 give 	 s 	 	you	great	 power 	 s 	 	.
your	 ambit 	 ion 	 	is	satisfied	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	great	pleasure	to	fly	around	.
and	so	these	combine	to	form	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
the	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	stuff	about	 virtual 	 ity 	 	is	what	you	can	measure	with	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	can	measure	in	 virtual 	 ity 	 	is	 every 	 thing 	 	.
every	single	thing	that	every	single	person	who	's	ever	 play 	 ed 	 	in	a	game	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 d 	 one 	 	can	be	 measur 	 ed 	 	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	 game 	 s 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	are	 measur 	 ing 	 	more	than	one	billion	 point 	 s 	 	of	data	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 player 	 s 	 	,	about	what	 every 	 body 	 	 do 	 es 	 	--	far	more	detail	than	you	'd	ever	get	from	any	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	special	to	happen	in	 game 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	reward	schedule	.
and	by	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	mean	looking	at	what	 million 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	have	 d 	 one 	 	and	 care 	 fully 	 	 calib 	 rating 	 	the	rate	,	the	nature	,	the	type	,	the	 intens 	 ity 	 	of	 reward 	 s 	 	in	 game 	 s 	 	to	keep	them	 engag 	 ed 	 	over	 stagger 	 ing 	 	 amount 	 s 	 	of	time	and	effort	.
now	,	to	try	and	explain	 th 	 is 	 	in	sort	of	real	 term 	 s 	 	,	i	want	to	talk	about	a	kind	of	task	that	might	fall	to	you	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 game 	 s 	 	.
go	and	get	a	certain	amount	of	a	certain	little	game	-	y	item	.
let	's	say	,	for	the	sake	of	argument	,	my	mission	is	to	get	15	pies	and	i	can	get	15	pies	by	 kill 	 ing 	 	these	cute	,	little	 mon 	 sters 	 	.
simple	game	quest	.
now	you	can	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	you	like	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	problem	about	boxes	.
i	've	got	to	keep	 open 	 ing 	 	boxes	.
i	do	n't	know	what	's	 in 	 side 	 	them	 un 	 til 	 	i	open	them	.
and	i	go	around	 open 	 ing 	 	box	after	box	 un 	 til 	 	i	've	got	15	pies	.
now	,	if	you	take	a	game	like	warcraft	,	you	can	think	about	it	,	if	you	like	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	great	box	-	 open 	 ing 	 	effort	.
the	game	's	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	people	to	open	about	a	million	boxes	,	 get 	 ting 	 	better	and	better	stuff	in	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	 immense 	 ly 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	but	 game 	 s 	 	are	able	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	process	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	.
and	the	way	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	through	a	combination	of	 prob 	 ability 	 	and	data	.
let	's	think	about	 prob 	 ability 	 	.
if	we	want	to	engage	 some 	 one 	 	in	the	process	of	 open 	 ing 	 	boxes	to	try	and	find	pies	,	we	want	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	it	's	 n 	 either 	 	too	easy	,	nor	too	difficult	,	to	find	a	pie	.
so	what	do	you	do	?	well	,	you	look	at	a	million	people	--	no	,	100	million	people	,	100	million	box	 open 	 ers 	 	--	and	you	work	out	,	if	you	make	the	pie	rate	about	25	percent	--	that	's	 n 	 either 	 	too	 frust 	 rating 	 	,	nor	too	easy	.
it	 keep 	 s 	 	people	 engag 	 ed 	 	.
but	of	course	,	that	's	not	all	you	do	--	there	's	15	pies	.
now	,	i	could	make	a	game	 call 	 ed 	 	piecraft	,	where	all	you	had	to	do	was	get	a	million	pies	or	a	thousand	pies	.
that	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
fifteen	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	optimal	number	.
you	find	that	--	you	know	,	between	five	and	20	is	about	the	right	number	for	 keep 	 ing 	 	people	going	.
but	we	do	n't	just	have	pies	in	the	boxes	.
there	's	100	percent	up	here	.
and	what	we	do	is	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	every	time	a	box	is	 open 	 ed 	 	,	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	in	it	,	some	little	reward	that	 keep 	 s 	 	people	 progress 	 ing 	 	and	 engag 	 ed 	 	.
in	most	adventure	 game 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	little	bit	in	-	game	 curr 	 ency 	 	,	a	little	bit	experience	.
but	we	do	n't	just	do	that	either	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	say	there	's	going	to	be	 load 	 s 	 	of	other	 item 	 s 	 	of	 vary 	 ing 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	and	 level 	 s 	 	of	 excit 	 ement 	 	.
there	's	going	to	be	a	10	percent	chance	you	get	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	item	.
there	's	going	to	be	a	0.1	percent	chance	you	get	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	awesome	item	.
and	each	of	these	 reward 	 s 	 	is	 care 	 fully 	 	 calibrate 	 d 	 	to	the	item	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	we	say	,	``	well	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 mon 	 sters 	 	?	should	i	have	the	entire	world	full	of	a	billion	 mon 	 sters 	 	?	``
no	,	we	want	one	or	two	 mon 	 sters 	 	on	the	screen	at	any	one	time	.
so	i	'm	drawn	on	.	it	's	not	too	easy	,	not	too	difficult	.
so	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
but	we	're	in	 virtual 	 ity 	 	.	these	are	n't	real	boxes	.
so	we	can	do	some	 ra 	 ther 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	notice	,	looking	at	all	these	people	 open 	 ing 	 	boxes	,	that	when	people	get	to	about	13	out	of	15	pies	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	 shift 	 s 	 	,	they	start	to	get	a	bit	 bor 	 ed 	 	,	a	bit	 test 	 y 	 	.
they	're	not	rational	about	 prob 	 ability 	 	.
they	think	 th 	 is 	 	game	is	 un 	 fair 	 	.
it	's	not	giving	me	my	last	two	pies	.	i	'm	going	to	give	up	.
if	they	're	real	boxes	,	there	's	not	much	we	can	do	,	but	in	a	game	we	can	just	say	,	``	right	,	well	.
when	you	get	to	13	pies	,	you	've	got	75	percent	chance	of	 get 	 ting 	 	a	pie	now	.	``
keep	you	 engag 	 ed 	 	.	look	at	what	people	do	--	adjust	the	world	to	match	 the 	 ir 	 	 expect 	 ation 	 	.
our	 game 	 s 	 	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	one	thing	they	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	at	the	moment	is	if	you	got	a	0.1	percent	awesome	item	,	they	make	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	 do 	 es 	 	n't	appear	for	a	certain	length	of	time	to	keep	the	value	,	to	keep	it	special	.
and	the	point	is	 re 	 ally 	 	that	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	be	satisfied	by	the	world	in	 part 	 icular 	 	ways	.
over	 ten 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	find	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	 stimul 	 ating 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	intelligent	,	 civil 	 ized 	 	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 stimul 	 ated 	 	by	problem	solving	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
but	now	,	we	can	reverse	engineer	that	and	build	 world 	 s 	 	that	 express 	 ly 	 	tick	our	 evolution 	 ary 	 	boxes	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	mean	in	practice	?
well	,	i	've	come	up	with	seven	 thing 	 s 	 	that	,	i	think	,	show	how	you	can	take	these	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	from	 game 	 s 	 	and	use	them	 out 	 side 	 	of	 game 	 s 	 	.
the	first	one	is	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	:	experience	 bar 	 s 	 	 measur 	 ing 	 	progress	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	by	people	like	jesse	schell	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	at	the	university	of	indiana	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	among	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	simple	idea	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 grad 	 ing 	 	people	 increment 	 ally 	 	in	little	bits	and	 piece 	 s 	 	,	you	give	them	one	profile	character	avatar	which	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	 progress 	 ing 	 	in	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	little	 increment 	 s 	 	which	they	feel	are	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	that	,	and	they	watch	it	 creep 	 ing 	 	up	,	and	they	own	that	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 long 	 	.
second	,	 multi 	 ple 	 	long	and	short	-	term	 aim 	 s 	 	--	5,000	pies	,	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	15	pies	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	you	give	people	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 task 	 s 	 	.
you	say	,	it	's	about	 do 	 ing 	 	10	of	these	 question 	 s 	 	,	but	 an 	 other 	 	task	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	up	to	20	 class 	 es 	 	on	time	,	but	 an 	 other 	 	task	is	 collabor 	 ating 	 	with	other	people	,	 an 	 other 	 	task	is	 show 	 ing 	 	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	five	 time 	 s 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	task	is	hitting	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	target	.
you	break	 thing 	 s 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	these	 calibrate 	 d 	 	 slice 	 s 	 	that	people	can	 choos 	 e 	 	and	do	in	parallel	to	keep	them	 engag 	 ed 	 	and	that	you	can	use	to	point	them	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 individual 	 ly 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
third	,	you	reward	effort	.
it	's	your	100	percent	factor	.	 game 	 s 	 	are	 brilli 	 ant 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
every	time	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	get	credit	;	you	get	a	credit	for	 try 	 ing 	 	.
you	do	n't	punish	failure	.	you	reward	every	little	bit	of	effort	--	a	little	bit	of	gold	,	a	little	bit	of	credit	.	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	20	 question 	 s 	 	--	tick	.
it	all	 feed 	 s 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 	minute	 reinforce 	 ment 	 	.
fourth	,	 feed 	 back 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 cruci 	 al 	 	,	and	 virtual 	 ity 	 	is	 dazzl 	 ing 	 	at	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	you	look	at	some	of	the	most	intractable	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	for	people	to	learn	if	they	can	not	link	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	to	 action 	 s 	 	.
 poll 	 ution 	 	,	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	are	 di 	 stant 	 	in	time	and	space	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	learn	,	to	feel	a	 less 	 on 	 	.
but	if	you	can	model	 thing 	 s 	 	for	people	,	if	you	can	give	 thing 	 s 	 	to	people	that	they	can	 manipul 	 ate 	 	and	play	with	and	where	the	 feed 	 back 	 	 come 	 s 	 	,	then	they	can	learn	a	 less 	 on 	 	,	they	can	see	,	they	can	move	on	,	they	can	understand	.
and	fifth	,	the	element	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 gold 	 mine 	 	,	if	you	like	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	known	reward	 excit 	 es 	 	people	,	but	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 s 	 	them	going	is	the	 un 	 certain 	 	reward	,	the	reward	 pitch 	 ed 	 	at	the	right	level	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	that	they	did	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	know	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	get	it	or	not	.
the	25	percent	.	 th 	 is 	 	 light 	 s 	 	the	brain	up	.
and	if	you	think	about	using	 th 	 is 	 	in	 test 	 ing 	 	,	in	just	 introduc 	 ing 	 	control	 element 	 s 	 	of	 random 	 ness 	 	in	all	 form 	 s 	 	of	 test 	 ing 	 	and	training	,	you	can	transform	the	 level 	 s 	 	of	people	's	 engage 	 ment 	 	by	 tap 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
when	we	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	predict	 some 	 thing 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	,	we	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	it	.
we	just	want	to	go	back	and	find	out	more	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	,	the	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	dopamine	.
it	's	 associate 	 d 	 	with	reward	-	seeking	behavior	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	is	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	happen	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	the	university	of	bristol	in	the	u.k.	,	where	we	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	be	able	to	model	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	dopamine	 level 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	we	can	predict	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	we	can	predict	 enhance 	 d 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	these	 window 	 s 	 	,	these	 window 	 s 	 	of	time	,	in	which	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	taking	place	at	an	 enhance 	 d 	 	level	.
and	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	flow	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	first	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 memor 	 y 	 	,	that	we	can	find	these	 moment 	 s 	 	.
when	 some 	 one 	 	is	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	remember	,	we	can	give	them	a	nugget	in	a	window	.
and	the	second	thing	is	confidence	,	that	we	can	see	how	game	-	 play 	 ing 	 	and	reward	 structure 	 s 	 	make	people	 brave 	 r 	 	,	make	them	more	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	 risk 	 s 	 	,	more	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	on	 difficult 	 y 	 	,	 hard 	 er 	 	to	 dis 	 courage 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	all	seem	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ini 	 ster 	 	.
but	you	know	,	sort	of	``	our	 brain 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 manipul 	 ated 	 	;	we	're	all	 addict 	 s 	 	.	``
the	word	``	 addict 	 ion 	 	``	is	 throw 	 n 	 	around	.
there	are	real	 concern 	 s 	 	there	.
but	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 neuro 	 logical 	 	turn	-	on	for	people	is	other	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 es 	 	us	.
in	reward	 term 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	money	;	it	's	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 give 	 n 	 	cash	--	that	's	nice	--	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	stuff	with	our	 peer 	 s 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	us	,	 collabor 	 ating 	 	with	us	.
and	i	want	to	tell	you	a	quick	story	about	1999	--	a	video	game	 call 	 ed 	 	everquest	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	video	game	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 dragon 	 s 	 	,	and	you	had	to	team	up	to	kill	them	--	42	people	,	up	to	42	to	kill	these	big	 dragon 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 drop 	 ped 	 	two	or	three	 de 	 cent 	 	 item 	 s 	 	.
so	 player 	 s 	 	 address 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	problem	by	 spontane 	 ously 	 	coming	up	with	a	system	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	each	other	,	 fair 	 ly 	 	and	 trans 	 parent 	 ly 	 	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	they	paid	each	other	a	virtual	 curr 	 ency 	 	they	 call 	 ed 	 	``	dragon	kill	 point 	 s 	 	.	``
and	every	time	you	 turn 	 ed 	 	up	to	go	on	a	mission	,	you	got	paid	in	dragon	kill	 point 	 s 	 	.
they	 track 	 ed 	 	these	on	a	 separat 	 e 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
so	they	 track 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	private	 curr 	 ency 	 	,	and	then	 player 	 s 	 	could	bid	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	for	cool	 item 	 s 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	--	all	 organize 	 d 	 	by	the	 player 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
now	the	 stagger 	 ing 	 	system	,	not	just	that	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	in	everquest	,	but	that	 to 	 day 	 	,	a	decade	on	,	every	single	video	game	in	the	world	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	task	uses	a	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	--	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	.
and	the	success	rate	is	at	close	to	100	percent	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	player	-	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	self	-	 en 	 forcing 	 	,	voluntary	 curr 	 ency 	 	,	and	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	player	behavior	.
and	i	just	want	to	end	by	 suggest 	 ing 	 	a	few	ways	in	which	these	 principle 	 s 	 	could	fan	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	.
let	's	start	with	business	.
i	mean	,	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	see	some	of	the	big	 problem 	 s 	 	around	 some 	 thing 	 	like	business	are	 recycl 	 ing 	 	and	energy	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.
we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	see	the	emergence	of	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	like	real	-	time	energy	 meter 	 s 	 	.
and	i	just	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	think	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	could	take	that	so	much	further	by	 allow 	 ing 	 	people	to	set	 target 	 s 	 	by	setting	 calibrate 	 d 	 	 target 	 s 	 	,	by	using	 element 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	by	using	these	 multi 	 ple 	 	 target 	 s 	 	,	by	using	a	grand	,	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	reward	and	incentive	system	,	by	setting	people	up	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 group 	 s 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 street 	 s 	 	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	and	compete	,	to	use	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	group	and	 motiv 	 ation 	 al 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	we	see	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	education	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 obvious 	 ly 	 	of	all	,	we	can	transform	how	we	engage	people	.
we	can	 off 	 er 	 	people	the	grand	 continu 	 ity 	 	of	experience	and	personal	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
we	can	break	 thing 	 s 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 calibrate 	 d 	 	small	 task 	 s 	 	.
we	can	use	 calcul 	 ated 	 	 random 	 ness 	 	.
we	can	reward	effort	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	together	.
and	we	can	use	the	kind	of	group	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	we	see	 evolv 	 ing 	 	when	people	are	at	play	together	,	these	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 unprecedented 	 ly 	 	complex	 co 	 operative 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	.
government	,	well	,	one	thing	that	 come 	 s 	 	to	mind	is	the	u.s.	government	,	among	 other 	 s 	 	,	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	pay	people	to	lose	weight	.
so	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	financial	reward	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	tackle	the	great	issue	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 reward 	 s 	 	could	be	 calibrate 	 d 	 	so	 precise 	 ly 	 	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	use	the	vast	 expert 	 ise 	 	of	 gam 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	to	just	jack	up	that	appeal	,	to	take	the	data	,	to	take	the	 observ 	 ations 	 	,	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	human	 hour 	 s 	 	and	plow	that	 feed 	 back 	 	 in 	 to 	 	increasing	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
and	in	the	end	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	word	,	``	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	``	that	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	.
it	's	about	how	individual	 engage 	 ment 	 	can	be	 transform 	 ed 	 	by	the	 psycho 	 logical 	 	and	the	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	we	can	learn	from	 watch 	 ing 	 	people	that	are	 play 	 ing 	 	 game 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	about	 collect 	 ive 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	and	about	the	unprecedented	 labor 	 atory 	 	for	 observ 	 ing 	 	what	 make 	 s 	 	people	tick	and	work	and	play	and	engage	on	a	grand	scale	in	 game 	 s 	 	.
and	if	we	can	look	at	these	 thing 	 s 	 	and	learn	from	them	and	see	how	to	turn	them	 out 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	then	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 revolution 	 ary 	 	on	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
