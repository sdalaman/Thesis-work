i	'd	like	to	start	 to 	 night 	 	by	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	to	join	me	by	 step 	 ping 	 	off	the	land	and	 jump 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	open	ocean	for	a	moment	.
90	percent	of	the	living	space	on	the	planet	is	in	the	open	ocean	,	and	it	's	where	life	--	the	title	of	our	 semi 	 nar 	 	 to 	 night 	 	--	it	's	where	life	 beg 	 an 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 live 	 ly 	 	and	a	 love 	 ly 	 	place	,	but	we	're	 rapid 	 ly 	 	changing	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	with	our	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	with	our	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	our	 ir 	 respons 	 ible 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	our	 add 	 ing 	 	of	 pollutant 	 s 	 	like	 fertil 	 izer 	 	from	our	 crop 	 land 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	most	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	with	climate	change	,	and	steve	schneider	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	,	will	be	going	 in 	 to 	 	 great 	 er 	 	detail	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	tinker	with	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	more	and	more	 report 	 s 	 	are	 predict 	 ing 	 	that	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 sea 	 s 	 	that	we	're	creating	will	be	 con 	 duc 	 ive 	 	to	low	-	energy	type	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	like	 jelly 	 fish 	 	and	bacteria	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	might	be	the	kind	of	 sea 	 s 	 	we	're	headed	for	.
now	 jelly 	 fish 	 	are	 strange 	 ly 	 	 hypno 	 tic 	 	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	and	you	'll	see	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 gorge 	 ous 	 	 one 	 s 	 	at	the	 aqua 	 rium 	 	on	friday	,	but	they	 s 	 ting 	 	like	hell	,	and	 jelly 	 fish 	 	sushi	and	sashimi	is	just	not	going	to	fill	you	up	.
about	100	 gram 	 s 	 	of	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 equal 	 s 	 	four	 calorie 	 s 	 	.
so	it	may	be	good	for	the	 waist 	 line 	 	,	but	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	wo	n't	keep	you	 sati 	 ated 	 	for	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.
and	a	sea	that	's	just	 fill 	 ed 	 	and	 tee 	 ming 	 	with	 jelly 	 fish 	 	is	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	all	the	other	 creature 	 s 	 	that	live	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	that	is	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	eat	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 vor 	 acious 	 	predator	 launch 	 ing 	 	a	sneak	attack	on	 th 	 is 	 	poor	little	 un 	 suspect 	 ing 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	there	,	a	by	-	the	-	wind	 sail 	 or 	 	.
and	that	predator	is	the	giant	ocean	 s 	 un 	 fish 	 	,	the	mola	mola	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	are	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	animal	is	in	``	the	guinness	world	book	of	 record 	 s 	 	``	for	 be 	 ing 	 	the	world	's	 heav 	 iest 	 	 bon 	 y 	 	fish	.
it	 reach 	 es 	 	up	to	 al 	 most 	 	5,000	 pound 	 s 	 	--	on	a	diet	of	 jelly 	 fish 	 	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	.
and	i	think	it	's	kind	of	a	nice	little	 cosmo 	 logical 	 	 converg 	 ence 	 	here	that	the	mola	mola	--	 it 	 s 	 	common	name	is	 s 	 un 	 fish 	 	--	that	 it 	 s 	 	 favor 	 ite 	 	food	is	the	moon	jelly	.
so	it	's	kind	of	nice	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	the	moon	 get 	 ting 	 	together	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	even	if	one	is	eating	the	other	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 typical 	 ly 	 	how	you	see	 s 	 un 	 fish 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	they	get	 the 	 ir 	 	common	name	.
they	like	to	 s 	 un 	 bath 	 e 	 	,	ca	n't	blame	them	.
they	just	lay	out	on	the	surface	of	the	sea	and	most	people	think	they	're	sick	or	 laz 	 y 	 	,	but	that	's	a	typical	behavior	,	they	lie	out	and	bask	on	the	surface	.
 the 	 ir 	 	other	name	,	mola	mola	,	is	--	it	 sound 	 s 	 	hawaiian	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	latin	for	 mill 	 stone 	 	,	and	that	's	 attribut 	 able 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 round 	 ish 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	bizarre	,	cut	-	off	shape	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	growing	,	they	just	 for 	 got 	 	the	tail	part	.
and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	drew	me	to	the	mola	in	the	first	place	,	was	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ibly 	 	bizarre	shape	.
you	know	,	you	look	at	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 stream 	 lined 	 	,	and	they	're	sleek	,	and	you	look	at	tuna	,	and	they	're	like	 torpedo 	 es 	 	--	they	just	give	away	 the 	 ir 	 	agenda	.	they	're	about	 migr 	 ation 	 	and	strength	,	and	then	you	look	at	the	 s 	 un 	 fish 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	so	 elegant 	 ly 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	,	it	's	just	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 hold 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 card 	 s 	 	a	lot	 tight 	 er 	 	than	say	,	a	tuna	.
so	i	was	just	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	with	what	--	you	know	,	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	animal	's	story	?
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	 any 	 thing 	 	in	biology	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	sense	 ex 	 cept 	 	in	the	light	of	evolution	.
the	mola	's	no	exception	.
they	 appear 	 ed 	 	 short 	 ly 	 	after	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	65	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	at	a	time	when	 whale 	 s 	 	still	had	 leg 	 s 	 	,	and	they	come	from	a	 re 	 bell 	 ious 	 	little	 puff 	 er 	 	fish	 fact 	 ion 	 	--	 oblig 	 e 	 	me	a	little	kipling	-	esque	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	here	.
of	course	evolution	is	 some 	 what 	 	random	,	and	you	know	,	about	55	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 bell 	 ious 	 	little	 puff 	 er 	 	fish	 fact 	 ion 	 	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	oh	,	the	heck	with	the	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	--	we	're	going	to	head	to	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	.
and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 generation 	 s 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 tweak 	 ing 	 	and	 tor 	 qu 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	turn	our	 puff 	 er 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	mola	.
you	know	,	if	you	give	mother	nature	 en 	 ough 	 	time	,	that	is	what	she	will	produce	.
they	look	--	 may 	 be 	 	they	look	kind	of	 pre 	 historic 	 	and	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 bridge 	 d 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	but	in	fact	,	in	fact	they	are	the	--	they	 vi 	 e 	 	for	the	top	position	of	the	most	 evolution 	 arily 	 	-	derived	fish	in	the	sea	,	right	up	there	with	flat	fish	.
they	're	--	every	single	thing	about	that	fish	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 fish 	 es 	 	--	 fish 	 es 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	500	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	they	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	modern	,	just	50	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	so	--	so	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	they	give	away	 the 	 ir 	 	 ance 	 stry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	develop	.
they	start	 a 	 s 	 	little	 egg 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	in	``	the	guinness	world	book	of	 record 	 s 	 	``	 aga 	 in 	 	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	most	number	of	 egg 	 s 	 	of	any	vertebrate	on	the	planet	.
a	single	four	-	foot	female	had	300	million	 egg 	 s 	 	,	can	carry	300	million	 egg 	 s 	 	in	her	 ov 	 aries 	 	--	imagine	--	and	they	get	to	be	over	10	feet	long	.	imagine	what	a	10	foot	one	 ha 	 s 	 	.
and	from	that	little	egg	,	they	pass	through	 th 	 is 	 	 spi 	 ky 	 	little	 por 	 cup 	 ine 	 	fish	stage	,	 re 	 mini 	 s 	 cent 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 ance 	 stry 	 	,	and	develop	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	little	adolescent	stage	.
they	school	 a 	 s 	 	 adolescent 	 s 	 	,	and	 be 	 come 	 	 be 	 he 	 moth 	 	 lon 	 ers 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	little	 div 	 er 	 	up	there	in	the	corner	.
they	're	in	``	the	guinness	world	book	of	 record 	 s 	 	``	 aga 	 in 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	the	vertebrate	growth	champion	of	the	world	.
from	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 hatch 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	egg	,	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 larva 	 l 	 	stage	till	they	reach	 adult 	 hood 	 	,	they	put	on	600	million	 time 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	weight	.
600	million	.	now	imagine	if	you	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	to	a	little	baby	,	and	you	had	to	feed	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
that	would	mean	that	your	child	,	you	would	expect	it	to	gain	the	weight	of	six	titanics	.
now	i	do	n't	know	how	you	'd	feed	a	child	like	that	but	--	we	do	n't	know	how	fast	the	molas	grow	in	the	wild	,	but	 captiv 	 e 	 	growth	 stud 	 ies 	 	at	the	monterey	 ba 	 y 	 	 aqua 	 rium 	 	--	one	of	the	first	 place 	 s 	 	to	have	them	in	 captiv 	 ity 	 	--	they	had	one	that	 gain 	 ed 	 	800	 lb 	 s 	 	in	14	 month 	 s 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	now	,	that	's	a	true	american	.
so	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 lon 	 er 	 	is	a	great	thing	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	 sea 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 school 	 ing 	 	used	to	be	 salv 	 ation 	 	for	 fish 	 es 	 	,	but	it	's	 su 	 icide 	 	for	 fish 	 es 	 	now	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	molas	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	do	n't	school	,	they	still	get	caught	in	 net 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	by	-	catch	.
if	we	're	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	from	total	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 domin 	 ation 	 	,	then	we	've	got	to	figure	out	what	the	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 predator 	 s 	 	--	how	they	live	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	like	the	mola	.
and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	they	make	up	a	large	 port 	 ion 	 	of	the	california	by	-	catch	--	up	to	26	percent	of	the	drift	net	.
and	in	the	mediterranean	,	in	the	 s 	 word 	 fish 	 	net	 fish 	 eries 	 	,	they	make	up	up	to	90	percent	.
so	we	've	got	to	figure	out	how	they	're	living	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	how	do	you	do	that	?
how	do	you	do	that	with	an	animal	--	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	open	ocean	creature	.	it	 know 	 s 	 	no	 bound 	 aries 	 	--	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	go	to	land	.
how	do	you	get	 in 	 sight 	 	?
how	do	you	seduce	an	open	ocean	creature	like	that	to	 s 	 pill 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 secret 	 s 	 	?
well	,	there	's	some	great	new	technology	that	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	it	's	just	a	 bo 	 on 	 	for	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	open	ocean	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 picture 	 d 	 	right	here	,	that	little	tag	up	there	.
that	little	tag	can	record	temperature	,	depth	and	light	 intens 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	 correlate 	 d 	 	with	time	,	and	from	that	we	can	get	 location 	 s 	 	.
and	it	can	record	 th 	 is 	 	data	for	up	to	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	keep	it	in	that	tag	,	 re 	 lease 	 	at	a	pre	-	 programm 	 ed 	 	time	,	float	to	the	surface	,	upload	all	that	data	,	that	whole	 travel 	 ogue 	 	,	to	satellite	,	which	 re 	 lay 	 s 	 	it	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	our	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	we	've	got	that	whole	 data 	 set 	 	.	and	we	did	n't	even	have	--	we	just	had	to	tag	the	animal	and	then	we	went	home	and	you	know	,	 s 	 at 	 	at	our	 desk 	 s 	 	.
so	the	great	thing	about	the	mola	is	that	when	we	put	the	tag	on	them	--	if	you	look	up	here	--	that	's	 stream 	 ing 	 	off	,	that	's	right	where	we	put	the	tag	.
and	it	just	so	 happen 	 s 	 	that	's	a	 parasit 	 e 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	off	the	mola	.
molas	are	 in 	 famous 	 	for	 carry 	 ing 	 	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 parasit 	 es 	 	.
they	're	just	 parasit 	 e 	 	 hotel 	 s 	 	;	even	 the 	 ir 	 	 parasit 	 es 	 	have	 parasit 	 es 	 	.
i	think	donne	wrote	a	poem	about	that	.
but	they	have	40	 gen 	 era 	 	of	 parasit 	 es 	 	,	and	so	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	just	one	more	 parasit 	 e 	 	wo	n't	be	too	much	of	a	problem	.
and	they	happen	to	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	vehicle	for	 carry 	 ing 	 	 ocean 	 o 	 graphic 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
they	do	n't	seem	to	mind	,	so	far	.
so	what	are	we	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	out	?	we	're	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
we	're	 tag 	 ging 	 	on	the	california	coast	,	and	we	're	 tag 	 ging 	 	over	in	taiwan	and	japan	.
and	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	using	the	 current 	 s 	 	,	using	temperature	,	using	the	open	ocean	,	to	live	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
we	'd	love	to	tag	in	monterey	.
monterey	is	one	of	the	few	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	world	where	molas	come	in	large	 number 	 s 	 	.
not	 th 	 is 	 	time	of	year	--	it	's	more	around	october	.
and	we	'd	love	to	tag	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 a 	 erial 	 	shot	of	monterey	--	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	molas	here	end	up	looking	like	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	our	 local 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 like 	 s 	 	molas	but	in	the	wrong	way	.
the	california	sea	lion	 take 	 s 	 	the	molas	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	they	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ba 	 y 	 	,	 rip 	 s 	 	off	 the 	 ir 	 	 fin 	 s 	 	,	 fashion 	 s 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	ultimate	frisbee	,	mola	style	,	and	then	 to 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	them	back	and	forth	.
and	i	'm	not	 exagge 	 rating 	 	,	it	is	just	--	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	eat	them	,	it	's	just	 spite 	 ful 	 	.
and	you	know	,	the	 local 	 s 	 	think	it	's	 terr 	 ible 	 	behavior	,	it	's	just	 horr 	 ible 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	happen	,	day	after	day	.
the	poor	little	molas	coming	in	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 rip 	 ped 	 	to	 shred 	 s 	 	,	so	we	head	down	south	,	to	san	diego	.
not	so	 man 	 y 	 	california	sea	 lion 	 s 	 	down	there	.
and	the	molas	there	,	you	can	find	them	with	a	 s 	 potter 	 	plane	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	,	and	they	like	to	hang	out	under	 float 	 ing 	 	 raft 	 s 	 	of	kelp	.
and	under	 t 	 hose 	 	 kelp 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	the	molas	come	there	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 s 	 pa 	 	time	for	the	molas	there	.
 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	they	get	under	 t 	 hose 	 	 raft 	 s 	 	of	kelp	,	the	 ex 	 folia 	 ting 	 	 clean 	 er 	 	fish	come	.
and	they	come	and	give	the	molas	--	you	can	see	they	strike	 th 	 is 	 	funny	little	position	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	not	 threaten 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	need	a	 mass 	 age 	 	.	``
and	they	'll	put	 the 	 ir 	 	 fin 	 s 	 	out	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	go	in	the	back	of	 the 	 ir 	 	head	,	and	the	fish	come	up	and	they	just	clean	,	clean	,	clean	--	 be 	 cause 	 	the	molas	,	you	know	,	there	's	just	a	smorgasbord	of	 parasit 	 es 	 	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	great	place	to	go	down	south	 be 	 cause 	 	the	water	's	 warm 	 er 	 	,	and	the	molas	are	kind	of	friendly	down	there	.
i	mean	what	other	kind	of	fish	,	if	you	approach	it	right	,	will	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	scratch	me	right	there	.	``
you	 tru 	 ly 	 	can	swim	up	to	a	mola	--	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	gentle	--	and	if	you	approach	them	right	,	you	can	give	them	a	scratch	and	they	enjoy	it	.
so	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	one	part	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	;	we	've	gone	over	to	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	and	we	've	 tag 	 ged 	 	in	taiwan	,	and	we	 tag 	 ged 	 	in	japan	.
and	over	in	these	 place 	 s 	 	,	the	molas	are	caught	in	set	 net 	 s 	 	that	line	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	they	're	not	 throw 	 n 	 	back	 a 	 s 	 	by	-	catch	,	they	're	eaten	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	a	nine	-	course	meal	of	mola	after	we	 tag 	 ged 	 	.
well	,	not	the	one	we	 tag 	 ged 	 	!
and	 every 	 thing 	 	from	the	 kid 	 ney 	 	,	to	the	 test 	 es 	 	,	to	the	back	bone	,	to	the	fin	muscle	to	--	i	think	that	ís	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	whole	fish	--	is	eaten	.
so	the	 hard 	 est 	 	part	of	 tag 	 ging 	 	,	now	,	is	after	you	put	that	tag	on	,	you	have	to	wait	,	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	you	're	just	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	oh	,	i	hope	the	fish	is	safe	,	i	hope	,	i	hope	it	's	going	to	be	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	live	 it 	 s 	 	life	out	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	course	that	the	tag	is	 record 	 ing 	 	.
the	 tag 	 s 	 	cost	3500	 dollar 	 s 	 	each	,	and	then	satellite	time	is	 an 	 other 	 	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	so	you	're	like	,	oh	,	i	hope	the	tag	is	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
and	so	the	 wait 	 ing 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 hard 	 est 	 	part	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	our	 lat 	 est 	 	 data 	 set 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	so	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 pri 	 vy 	 	information	just	for	ted	.
and	in	 show 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	,	when	we	're	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	data	,	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	oh	do	these	 animal 	 s 	 	,	do	they	cross	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	?
do	they	go	from	one	side	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	to	the	other	?
and	we	found	that	they	kind	of	are	 home 	 bodies 	 	.
they	're	not	big	 migr 	 ators 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	track	:	we	 deploy 	 ed 	 	the	tag	off	of	tokyo	,	and	the	mola	in	one	month	kind	of	got	 in 	 to 	 	the	kuroshio	current	off	of	japan	and	 for 	 aged 	 	there	.
and	after	four	 month 	 s 	 	,	went	up	,	you	know	,	off	of	the	north	part	of	japan	.
and	that	's	kind	of	 the 	 ir 	 	home	range	.
now	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	there	's	a	lot	of	 fish 	 ing 	 	pressure	,	that	population	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	 replenish 	 ed 	 	.
so	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	piece	of	data	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	they	're	not	 s 	 lack 	 er 	 	,	 laz 	 y 	 	fish	.
they	're	super	industrious	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	day	in	the	life	of	a	mola	,	and	if	we	--	they	're	up	and	down	,	and	up	and	down	,	and	up	and	down	,	and	up	and	up	and	down	,	up	to	40	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	 come 	 s 	 	up	,	you	see	in	the	blue	,	they	start	 the 	 ir 	 	 d 	 ive 	 	.
down	--	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 bright 	 er 	 	they	go	a	little	 deep 	 er 	 	,	little	 deep 	 er 	 	.
they	plumb	the	 depth 	 s 	 	down	to	600	 meter 	 s 	 	,	in	 temperature 	 s 	 	to	one	degree	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	you	see	them	on	the	surface	--	it	's	so	cold	down	there	.
they	've	got	to	come	up	,	warm	,	get	that	solar	power	,	and	then	plunge	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 depth 	 s 	 	,	and	go	up	and	down	and	up	and	down	.
and	they	're	hitting	a	layer	down	there	;	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	deep	 scatter 	 ing 	 	layer	--	which	a	whole	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	food	's	in	that	layer	.
so	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	 be 	 ing 	 	some	 s 	 un 	 bath 	 ing 	 	 s 	 lack 	 er 	 	,	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	industrious	fish	that	dance	 th 	 is 	 	wild	dance	between	the	surface	and	the	bottom	and	through	temperature	.
we	see	the	same	pattern	--	now	with	these	 tag 	 s 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	a	similar	pattern	for	 s 	 word 	 fish 	 es 	 	,	 man 	 ta 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	,	 tuna 	 s 	 	,	a	real	three	-	dimensional	play	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	part	of	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	program	 call 	 ed 	 	the	census	of	marine	life	,	where	they	're	going	to	be	 tag 	 ging 	 	all	over	the	world	and	the	mola	's	going	to	enter	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
and	what	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	--	you	all	travel	,	and	you	know	the	best	thing	about	 travel 	 ing 	 	is	to	be	able	to	find	the	 local 	 s 	 	,	and	to	find	the	great	 place 	 s 	 	by	 get 	 ting 	 	the	local	knowledge	.
well	now	with	the	census	of	marine	life	,	we	'll	be	able	to	 sid 	 le 	 	up	to	all	the	 local 	 s 	 	and	explore	90	percent	of	our	living	space	,	with	local	knowledge	.
it	's	never	--	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	a	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	or	a	vital	time	,	to	be	a	biologist	.
which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	my	last	point	,	and	what	i	think	is	kind	of	the	most	 f 	 un 	 	.
i	set	up	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 question 	 s 	 	about	molas	and	 s 	 un 	 fish 	 	.
and	so	i	just	 figur 	 ed 	 	i	'd	have	the	 question 	 s 	 	 answer 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	'd	be	able	to	thank	my	 fund 	 ers 	 	,	like	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	and	lindbergh	.
but	people	would	write	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 ite 	 	with	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	about	these	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 want 	 ing 	 	to	help	me	get	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	for	genetic	analysis	.
and	what	i	found	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	is	that	 every 	 one 	 	had	a	 share 	 d 	 	--	a	 share 	 d 	 	love	and	an	interest	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	 report 	 s 	 	from	catholic	 n 	 un 	 s 	 	,	jewish	 rabbi 	 s 	 	,	muslims	,	christians	--	 every 	 body 	 	writing	in	,	 unit 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	love	of	life	.
and	to	me	that	--	i	do	n't	think	i	could	say	it	any	better	than	the	 im 	 mortal 	 	bard	 him 	 self 	 	:	``	one	touch	of	nature	 make 	 s 	 	the	whole	world	kin	.	``
and	 s 	 ure 	 	,	it	may	be	just	one	big	old	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	fish	,	but	it	's	 help 	 ing 	 	.
if	it	's	 help 	 ing 	 	to	 un 	 ite 	 	the	world	,	i	think	it	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	the	fish	of	the	future	.
