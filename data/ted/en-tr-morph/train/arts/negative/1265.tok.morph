hi	.	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	take	you	through	 glimps 	 es 	 	of	about	eight	of	my	 project 	 s 	 	,	 d 	 one 	 	in	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	danish	artist	soren	pors	.
we	call	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	pors	&	rao	,	and	we	live	and	work	in	india	.
i	'd	like	to	begin	with	my	 ver 	 y 	 	first	object	,	which	i	call	``	the	uncle	phone	.	``
and	it	was	inspired	by	my	uncle	's	peculiar	habit	of	 constant 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	for	him	,	 al 	 most 	 	like	i	 we 	 re 	 	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	his	body	--	to	turn	on	the	 light 	 s 	 	or	to	 br 	 ing 	 	him	a	glass	of	water	,	a	pack	of	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	grew	up	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	and	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	form	of	control	.
but	of	course	,	i	could	never	say	 any 	 thing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	uncle	is	a	 respect 	 ed 	 	figure	in	the	indian	family	.
and	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	 ir 	 ked 	 	me	and	 myst 	 ified 	 	me	the	most	was	his	use	of	a	 land 	 line 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 	.
he	would	hold	on	to	the	 receiv 	 er 	 	and	expect	me	to	dial	a	number	for	him	.
and	so	 a 	 s 	 	a	 respons 	 e 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	gift	to	my	uncle	,	i	made	him	``	the	uncle	phone	.	``
it	's	so	long	that	it	 requir 	 es 	 	two	people	to	use	it	.
it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	way	my	uncle	uses	a	phone	that	's	designed	for	one	person	.
but	the	problem	is	that	,	when	i	left	home	and	went	to	college	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	his	 command 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	made	him	a	 gold 	 en 	 	 type 	 writer 	 	through	which	he	could	 dispens 	 e 	 	his	 command 	 s 	 	to	 nephew 	 s 	 	and	 niece 	 s 	 	around	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	an	email	.
so	what	he	had	to	do	was	take	a	piece	of	paper	,	roll	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	carriage	,	type	his	email	or	command	and	pull	the	paper	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	would	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 s 	 end 	 	the	 intend 	 ed 	 	person	the	letter	 a 	 s 	 	an	email	.
so	here	you	can	see	,	we	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	that	 understand 	 s 	 	all	of	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 action 	 s 	 	and	 convert 	 s 	 	it	to	digital	.
so	my	uncle	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	a	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 inter 	 face 	 	.
and	of	course	,	the	object	had	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	grand	and	have	a	sense	of	 ritual 	 ism 	 	,	the	way	my	uncle	 like 	 s 	 	it	.
the	next	work	is	a	sound	-	sensitive	 install 	 ation 	 	that	we	 affect 	 ion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	call	``	the	 pyg 	 mies 	 	.	``
and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	work	with	a	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	a	tribe	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 hy 	 	,	sensitive	and	sweet	 creature 	 s 	 	.
so	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	we	have	these	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	,	which	we	have	on	the	wall	,	and	 be 	 hind 	 	them	,	we	have	these	little	 creature 	 s 	 	which	hide	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	silent	,	they	sort	of	creep	out	.
and	if	it	's	even	more	silent	,	they	stretch	 the 	 ir 	 	 neck 	 s 	 	out	.
and	at	the	 s 	 light 	 est 	 	sound	,	they	hide	back	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	we	had	these	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	on	three	 wall 	 s 	 	of	a	room	.
and	we	had	over	500	of	these	little	 pyg 	 mies 	 	 hid 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	video	prototype	.
so	when	it	's	quiet	,	it	's	sort	of	coming	out	from	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	.
and	they	hear	like	 human 	 s 	 	do	,	or	real	 creature 	 s 	 	do	.
so	they	get	 immun 	 e 	 	to	 sound 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 care 	 	them	after	 a 	 while 	 	.
and	they	do	n't	react	to	 back 	 ground 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	.
you	'll	hear	a	train	in	moment	that	they	do	n't	react	to	.
but	they	react	to	 fore 	 ground 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	.	you	'll	hear	that	in	a	second	.
so	we	 work 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	make	them	 a 	 s 	 	 life 	 like 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
so	each	 pyg 	 my 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	behavior	,	 psych 	 e 	 	,	mood	 s 	 wing 	 s 	 	,	 personal 	 ities 	 	and	so	on	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	early	prototype	.
of	course	,	it	got	much	better	after	that	.
and	we	made	them	react	to	people	,	but	we	found	that	people	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 play 	 ful 	 	and	 child 	 like 	 	with	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	video	 install 	 ation 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	person	.	``
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	with	 play 	 ing 	 	with	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 in 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	.
how	would	it	be	possible	to	experience	a	sense	of	 in 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	?
so	we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	a	company	that	 special 	 ize 	 s 	 	in	camera	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	,	and	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	develop	a	piece	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	with	us	,	using	a	camera	that	could	look	at	people	in	the	room	,	track	them	and	replace	one	person	with	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	 render 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 visible 	 	.
so	i	'm	just	going	to	show	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	early	prototype	.
on	the	right	side	you	can	see	my	 col 	 league 	 	soren	,	who	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	space	.
and	on	the	left	side	,	you	'll	see	the	 process 	 ed 	 	video	where	the	camera	 ha 	 s 	 	made	him	 in 	 visible 	 	.
soren	 enter 	 s 	 	the	room	.	pop	!	he	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	.
and	you	can	see	that	the	camera	is	 track 	 ing 	 	him	and	 era 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	early	video	,	so	we	have	n't	yet	 deal 	 t 	 	with	the	 over 	 lap 	 	and	all	of	that	,	but	that	got	 refine 	 d 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	how	we	used	it	was	in	a	room	where	we	had	a	camera	looking	 in 	 to 	 	the	space	,	and	we	had	one	monitor	,	one	on	each	wall	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	people	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	,	they	would	see	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	monitor	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	with	one	 differ 	 ence 	 	:	one	person	was	 constant 	 ly 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	 where 	 ver 	 	they	 move 	 d 	 	in	the	room	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	work	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 s 	 un 	 	shadow	.	``
and	it	was	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	sheet	of	paper	,	like	a	 cut 	 out 	 	of	a	 child 	 like 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	of	an	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	or	a	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	from	the	front	,	 th 	 is 	 	object	 appear 	 ed 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	and	 ro 	 bust 	 	,	and	from	the	side	,	it	 al 	 most 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	weak	.
so	people	would	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	and	they	'd	 al 	 most 	 	 ignor 	 e 	 	it	,	 think 	 ing 	 	it	was	some	crap	 lay 	 ing 	 	around	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	they	 pass 	 ed 	 	by	,	it	would	start	to	climb	up	the	wall	in	 jerk 	 y 	 	fashion	.
and	it	would	get	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	would	collapse	every	time	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	work	is	a	 caricatur 	 e 	 	of	an	 up 	 side 	 	-	down	man	.
his	head	is	so	heavy	,	full	of	heavy	 thought 	 s 	 	,	that	it	's	sort	of	 fall 	 en 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	hat	,	and	his	body	's	grown	out	of	him	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	plant	.
well	what	he	 do 	 es 	 	is	he	 move 	 s 	 	around	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 drunk 	 en 	 	fashion	on	his	head	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	and	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 s 	 low 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	it	's	kind	of	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	by	that	circle	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	that	circle	 we 	 re 	 	n't	there	,	and	the	floor	was	 ver 	 y 	 	even	,	it	would	start	to	wander	about	in	the	space	.
and	there	's	no	 wire 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'll	just	show	you	an	 in 	 stance 	 	--	so	when	people	enter	the	room	,	it	 activate 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	object	.
and	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	over	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	sort	of	 pain 	 fully 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	and	then	it	 gain 	 s 	 	 moment 	 um 	 	and	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	about	to	fall	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	moment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	instill	in	the	 view 	 er 	 	an	instinct	to	 al 	 most 	 	go	and	help	,	or	 s 	 ave 	 	the	subject	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	need	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	sort	of	 manage 	 s 	 	to	pull	 it 	 self 	 	up	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	work	was	a	real	technical	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	us	,	and	we	 work 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	,	like	most	of	our	 work 	 s 	 	,	over	 year 	 s 	 	to	get	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	right	and	the	equilibrium	and	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	to	establish	the	exact	moment	that	it	would	fall	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	made	it	in	a	way	that	it	would	 top 	 ple 	 	over	,	then	it	would	damage	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	if	it	did	n't	fall	 en 	 ough 	 	,	it	would	n't	instill	that	 fatal 	 ism 	 	,	or	that	sense	of	 want 	 ing 	 	to	go	and	help	it	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	video	where	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	a	test	scenario	--	it	's	much	 fast 	 er 	 	.
that	's	my	 col 	 league 	 	.	he	's	let	it	go	.
now	he	's	 get 	 ting 	 	nervous	,	so	he	's	going	to	go	catch	it	.
but	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 manage 	 s 	 	to	lift	 it 	 self 	 	up	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	work	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	with	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	aesthetic	of	fur	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	with	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	different	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	of	fiber	 optic 	 s 	 	,	which	 twinkl 	 e 	 	like	the	night	sky	.
and	it	's	at	the	scale	of	the	night	sky	.
so	we	 wrap 	 ped 	 	 th 	 is 	 	around	a	blob	-	like	form	,	which	is	in	the	shape	of	a	 ted 	 dy 	 	bear	,	which	was	 hang 	 ing 	 	from	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	idea	was	to	sort	of	contrast	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	and	 di 	 stant 	 	and	abstract	like	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	familiar	form	of	a	 ted 	 dy 	 	bear	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 ing 	 	and	 intima 	 te 	 	.
and	the	idea	was	that	at	some	point	you	would	stop	looking	at	the	form	of	a	 ted 	 dy 	 	bear	and	you	would	 al 	 most 	 	perceive	it	to	be	a	hole	in	the	space	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	looking	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 twinkl 	 ing 	 	night	sky	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	work	,	and	a	work	in	progress	,	and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	space	 fill 	 er 	 	.	``
well	imagine	a	small	cube	that	's	about	 th 	 is 	 	big	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	you	in	the	middle	of	the	room	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	 approach 	 ed 	 	it	,	it	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 intimid 	 ate 	 	you	by	growing	 in 	 to 	 	a	cube	that	's	twice	 it 	 s 	 	height	and	[	eight	]	 time 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	volume	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	 expand 	 ing 	 	and	 contract 	 ing 	 	to	create	a	dynamic	with	people	moving	around	it	--	 al 	 most 	 	like	it	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	conceal	a	secret	 with 	 in 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 seam 	 s 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	we	work	with	a	lot	of	technology	,	but	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	love	technology	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	lot	of	pain	in	our	work	over	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	we	use	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	way	that	it	can	help	us	to	express	the	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	 behavior 	 al 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	these	 creature 	 s 	 	that	we	create	.
and	once	a	creature	 pop 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 mind 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	the	process	of	creation	is	to	discover	the	way	 th 	 is 	 	creature	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	exist	and	what	form	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	take	and	what	way	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	move	.
thank	you	.
