you	know	,	culture	was	born	of	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	and	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	--	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	--	came	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	when	our	species	 descend 	 ed 	 	from	our	progenitor	,	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	,	and	,	 in 	 fused 	 	with	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	 beg 	 an 	 	a	journey	that	would	carry	it	to	every	corner	of	the	 habit 	 able 	 	world	.
for	a	time	,	we	 share 	 d 	 	the	stage	with	our	 di 	 stant 	 	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	neanderthal	,	who	 clear 	 ly 	 	had	some	spark	of	 aware 	 ness 	 	,	but	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	was	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	brain	,	or	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	language	,	or	some	other	 evolution 	 ary 	 	catalyst	--	we	 quick 	 ly 	 	left	neanderthal	 gasp 	 ing 	 	for	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
by	the	time	the	last	neanderthal	 disappear 	 ed 	 	in	europe	,	27,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	our	direct	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	had	 al 	 ready 	 	,	and	for	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 en 	 	 crawl 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bel 	 ly 	 	of	the	earth	,	where	in	the	light	of	the	 flick 	 ers 	 	of	 t 	 allow 	 	 candle 	 s 	 	,	they	had	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	great	art	of	the	upper	paleolithic	.
and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	two	 month 	 s 	 	in	the	 cave 	 s 	 	of	 south 	 west 	 	france	with	the	poet	clayton	eshleman	,	who	wrote	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 juni 	 per 	 	fuse	.	``
and	you	could	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	art	and	you	could	,	of	course	,	see	the	complex	social	 organ 	 ization 	 	of	the	people	who	 br 	 ought 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	it	spoke	of	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 year 	 ning 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	far	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	than	 hunt 	 ing 	 	magic	.
and	the	way	clayton	put	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	at	some	point	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	of	an	animal	nature	,	and	at	some	point	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	.	``
and	he	 view 	 ed 	 	proto	-	 sha 	 man 	 ism 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	original	attempt	,	through	ritual	,	to	rekindle	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 irrevoc 	 ably 	 	lost	.
so	,	he	saw	 th 	 is 	 	art	not	 a 	 s 	 	 hunt 	 ing 	 	magic	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	of	nostalgia	.
and	 view 	 ed 	 	in	that	light	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	on	a	whole	other	 reson 	 ance 	 	.
and	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	about	the	upper	paleolithic	art	is	that	 a 	 s 	 	an	aesthetic	 express 	 ion 	 	,	it	 last 	 ed 	 	for	 al 	 most 	 	20,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	these	 we 	 re 	 	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	of	nostalgia	,	 our 	 s 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 fare 	 well 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	our	 dis 	 content 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	distill	all	of	our	experience	since	the	paleolithic	,	it	would	come	down	to	two	 word 	 s 	 	:	how	and	why	.
and	these	are	the	 s 	 liver 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 sight 	 	 up 	 on 	 	which	 culture 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 for 	 ged 	 	.
now	,	all	people	share	the	same	raw	,	 adapt 	 ive 	 	 imper 	 ative 	 s 	 	.
we	all	have	children	.
we	all	have	to	deal	with	the	 myster 	 y 	 	of	death	,	the	world	that	 wait 	 s 	 	beyond	death	,	the	 elder 	 s 	 	who	fall	away	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 elder 	 ly 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	part	of	our	common	experience	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	should	n't	surprise	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	after	all	,	 biologist 	 s 	 	have	 final 	 ly 	 	proven	it	to	be	true	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 dream 	 t 	 	to	be	true	.
and	that	is	the	fact	that	we	are	all	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	.
we	are	all	cut	from	the	same	genetic	cloth	.
all	of	 human 	 ity 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	is	 descend 	 ed 	 	from	a	thousand	people	who	left	africa	 rough 	 ly 	 	70,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
but	the	 co 	 roll 	 ary 	 	of	that	is	that	,	if	we	all	are	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	and	share	the	same	genetic	material	,	all	human	 population 	 s 	 	share	the	same	raw	human	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	the	same	intellectual	 acu 	 ity 	 	.
and	so	 whet 	 her 	 	that	 gen 	 ius 	 	is	 place 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	--	 techno 	 logical 	 	 wizard 	 ry 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	great	 achiev 	 ement 	 	of	the	west	--	or	by	contrast	,	 in 	 to 	 	 unravel 	 ing 	 	the	complex	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	of	 memor 	 y 	 	inherent	in	a	myth	,	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	matter	of	choice	and	cultural	 orient 	 ation 	 	.
there	is	no	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	in	human	experience	.
there	is	no	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	of	progress	.	there	's	no	pyramid	that	 convenient 	 ly 	 	 place 	 s 	 	victorian	england	at	the	 ap 	 ex 	 	and	 descend 	 s 	 	down	the	 flan 	 k 	 s 	 	to	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 primitive 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
all	 people 	 s 	 	are	 simpl 	 y 	 	cultural	 option 	 s 	 	,	different	 vision 	 s 	 	of	life	 it 	 self 	 	.
but	what	do	i	mean	by	different	 vision 	 s 	 	of	life	making	for	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 possibil 	 ities 	 	for	 exist 	 ence 	 	?
well	,	let	's	slip	for	a	moment	 in 	 to 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	culture	sphere	ever	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	by	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	that	of	polynesia	.
10,000	square	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	 f 	 lung 	 	like	 jewel 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	the	southern	sea	.
i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ailed 	 	on	the	hokulea	,	named	after	the	sacred	star	of	hawaii	,	 through 	 out 	 	the	south	 pac 	 ific 	 	to	make	a	film	about	the	 navig 	 ators 	 	.
these	are	men	and	women	who	,	even	 to 	 day 	 	,	can	name	250	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	night	sky	.
these	are	men	and	women	who	can	sense	the	presence	of	 di 	 stant 	 	 a 	 toll 	 s 	 	of	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	beyond	the	visible	horizon	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	 reverbe 	 ration 	 	of	 wave 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	hull	of	 the 	 ir 	 	vessel	,	 know 	 ing 	 	full	well	that	every	 is 	 land 	 	group	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	 refr 	 active 	 	pattern	that	can	be	read	with	the	same	 perspi 	 ca 	 city 	 	with	which	a	forensic	scientist	would	read	a	 finger 	 print 	 	.
these	are	 sail 	 ors 	 	who	in	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	in	the	hull	of	the	vessel	,	can	distinguish	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	32	different	sea	 s 	 well 	 s 	 	moving	through	the	canoe	at	any	one	point	in	time	,	 distinguish 	 ing 	 	local	wave	 disturb 	 ance 	 s 	 	from	the	great	 current 	 s 	 	that	 puls 	 ate 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	,	that	can	be	 follow 	 ed 	 	with	the	same	ease	that	a	terrestrial	 explore 	 r 	 	would	follow	a	river	to	the	sea	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	took	all	of	the	 gen 	 ius 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	put	a	man	on	the	moon	and	 appli 	 ed 	 	it	to	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	ocean	,	what	you	would	get	is	polynesia	.
and	if	we	slip	from	the	realm	of	the	sea	 in 	 to 	 	the	realm	of	the	spirit	of	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	you	enter	the	realm	of	tibetan	buddhism	.
and	i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	made	a	film	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	buddhist	science	of	the	mind	.	``
why	did	we	use	that	word	,	science	?
what	is	science	but	the	 empir 	 ical 	 	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	the	truth	?
what	is	buddhism	but	2,500	 year 	 s 	 	of	 empir 	 ical 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	the	nature	of	mind	?
i	 travel 	 led 	 	for	a	month	in	nepal	with	our	good	friend	,	matthieu	ricard	,	and	you	'll	remember	matthieu	 famous 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	all	of	us	here	once	at	ted	,	``	western	science	is	a	major	 respons 	 e 	 	to	minor	 need 	 s 	 	.	``
we	 s 	 pend 	 	all	of	our	 life 	 time 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	live	to	be	100	 with 	 out 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	our	 tee 	 th 	 	.
the	buddhist	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 time 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	nature	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
our	 bill 	 board 	 s 	 	 celebr 	 ate 	 	naked	children	in	 under 	 wear 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 bill 	 board 	 s 	 	are	 manual 	 s 	 	,	 pray 	 ers 	 	to	the	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	all	 senti 	 ent 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
and	with	the	 bless 	 ing 	 	of	trulshik	rinpoche	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	a	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	to	a	 cur 	 ious 	 	destination	,	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	a	great	doctor	.
and	the	destination	was	a	single	room	in	a	 n 	 un 	 nery 	 	,	where	a	woman	had	gone	 in 	 to 	 	 life 	 long 	 	 re 	 treat 	 	55	 year 	 s 	 	before	.
and	en	route	,	we	took	darshan	from	rinpoche	,	and	he	 s 	 at 	 	with	us	and	told	us	about	the	four	noble	 truth 	 s 	 	,	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	the	buddhist	path	.
all	life	is	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	all	life	is	negative	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
the	cause	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	is	 ignor 	 ance 	 	.
by	that	,	the	buddha	did	not	mean	 stupid 	 ity 	 	;	he	 me 	 ant 	 	 cl 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	the	illusion	that	life	is	static	and	 predict 	 able 	 	.
the	third	noble	truth	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 ignor 	 ance 	 	can	be	 over 	 come 	 	.
and	the	fourth	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	of	course	,	was	the	 de 	 line 	 ation 	 	of	a	 contempl 	 ative 	 	practice	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	had	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	a	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	the	human	heart	,	but	had	2,500	 year 	 s 	 	of	 empir 	 ical 	 	evidence	that	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 transform 	 ation 	 	was	a	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
and	so	,	when	 th 	 is 	 	door	 open 	 ed 	 	onto	the	face	of	a	woman	who	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	out	of	that	room	in	55	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	did	not	see	a	mad	woman	.
you	saw	a	woman	who	was	more	clear	than	a	pool	of	water	in	a	mountain	stream	.
and	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	tibetan	 monk 	 s 	 	told	us	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	at	one	point	,	you	know	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	you	went	to	the	moon	,	but	you	did	.
you	may	not	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	 achiev 	 e 	 	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	in	one	 life 	 time 	 	,	but	we	do	.
and	if	we	move	from	the	realm	of	the	spirit	to	the	realm	of	the	physical	,	to	the	sacred	 geo 	 graphy 	 	of	peru	--	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 relationship 	 s 	 	of	 indi 	 genous 	 	people	that	 liter 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	earth	is	 al 	 ive 	 	,	 respons 	 ive 	 	to	all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 aspir 	 ations 	 	,	all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 need 	 s 	 	.
and	,	of	course	,	the	human	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	 reciproc 	 al 	 	 oblig 	 ations 	 	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	living	 among 	 st 	 	the	people	of	chinchero	and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	heard	about	an	event	that	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	.
once	each	year	,	the	 fast 	 est 	 	young	boy	in	each	 ham 	 let 	 	is	 give 	 n 	 	the	honor	of	 be 	 coming 	 	a	woman	.
and	for	one	day	,	he	 wear 	 s 	 	the	 cloth 	 ing 	 	of	his	sister	and	he	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 trans 	 vest 	 ite 	 	,	a	waylaka	.	and	for	that	day	,	he	 lead 	 s 	 	all	able	-	bodied	men	on	a	run	,	but	it	's	not	your	 ordin 	 ary 	 	run	.
you	start	off	at	11,500	feet	.
you	run	down	to	the	base	of	the	sacred	mountain	,	antakillqa	.
you	run	up	to	15,000	feet	,	descend	3,000	feet	.
climb	 aga 	 in 	 	over	the	course	of	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	the	 waylaka 	 ma 	 	spin	,	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	of	the	route	,	is	 mark 	 ed 	 	by	holy	 mound 	 s 	 	of	earth	,	where	 co 	 ke 	 	is	 give 	 n 	 	to	the	earth	,	 lib 	 ations 	 	of	alcohol	to	the	wind	,	the	 vor 	 t 	 ex 	 	of	the	 femin 	 ine 	 	is	 br 	 ought 	 	to	the	 mountain 	 top 	 	.
and	the	metaphor	is	clear	:	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	mountain	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	,	but	through	 exhaust 	 ion 	 	,	through	sacrifice	,	you	emerge	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	that	 ha 	 s 	 	once	 aga 	 in 	 	 re 	 affirm 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	sense	of	place	in	the	planet	.
and	at	48	,	i	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 out 	 sider 	 	ever	to	go	through	 th 	 is 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	one	to	finish	it	.
i	 on 	 ly 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	to	do	it	by	 chew 	 ing 	 	more	coca	 leav 	 es 	 	in	one	day	than	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	4,000	-	year	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	plant	.
but	these	 local 	 ized 	 	 ritual 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	pan	-	andean	,	and	these	fantastic	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	,	like	that	of	the	qoyllur	rit'i	,	which	 occur 	 s 	 	when	the	pleiades	 re 	 appear 	 	in	the	winter	sky	.
it	's	kind	of	like	an	andean	woodstock	:	60,000	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	on	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	to	the	end	of	a	dirt	road	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	the	sacred	 val 	 ley 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	sinakara	,	which	is	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	three	 tongue 	 s 	 	of	the	great	 glaci 	 er 	 	.
the	metaphor	is	so	clear	.	you	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 cross 	 es 	 	from	your	community	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	fusion	of	christian	and	pre	-	columbian	 idea 	 s 	 	.
you	place	the	cross	 in 	 to 	 	the	ice	,	in	the	shadow	of	ausangate	,	the	most	sacred	of	all	apus	,	or	sacred	 mountain 	 s 	 	of	the	inca	.
and	then	you	do	the	ritual	 dance 	 s 	 	that	empower	the	 cross 	 es 	 	.
now	,	these	 idea 	 s 	 	and	these	 event 	 s 	 	allow	us	even	to	 de 	 construct 	 	 icon 	 ic 	 	 place 	 s 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	to	,	like	machu	picchu	.
machu	picchu	was	never	a	lost	city	.
on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	it	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	linked	in	to	the	14,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	of	royal	 road 	 s 	 	the	inca	made	in	less	than	a	century	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	linked	in	to	the	andean	 not 	 ions 	 	of	sacred	 geo 	 graphy 	 	.
the	 intiwa 	 tana 	 	,	the	 hitch 	 ing 	 	post	to	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	obelisk	that	 constant 	 ly 	 	 reflect 	 s 	 	the	light	that	 fall 	 s 	 	on	the	sacred	apu	of	machu	picchu	,	which	is	sugarloaf	mountain	,	 call 	 ed 	 	huayna	picchu	.
if	you	come	to	the	south	of	the	 intiwa 	 tana 	 	,	you	find	an	 al 	 tar 	 	.
climb	huayna	picchu	,	find	 an 	 other 	 	 al 	 tar 	 	.
take	a	direct	north	-	south	 bear 	 ing 	 	,	you	find	to	your	 astonish 	 ment 	 	that	it	 bi 	 s 	 ect 	 s 	 	the	 intiwa 	 tana 	 	stone	,	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	 sky 	 line 	 	,	 hit 	 s 	 	the	heart	of	salcantay	,	the	second	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 mountain 	 s 	 	of	the	incan	empire	.
and	then	beyond	salcantay	,	of	course	,	when	the	southern	cross	 reach 	 es 	 	the	 southern 	 most 	 	point	in	the	sky	,	 direct 	 ly 	 	in	that	same	 align 	 ment 	 	,	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	 over 	 head 	 	.
but	what	is	 envelop 	 ing 	 	machu	picchu	from	 be 	 low 	 	?
the	sacred	river	,	the	urubamba	,	or	the	vilcanota	,	which	is	 it 	 self 	 	the	 earth 	 ly 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	that	viracocha	 walk 	 ed 	 	at	the	dawn	of	time	when	he	 br 	 ought 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	where	 do 	 es 	 	the	river	rise	?
right	on	the	 slop 	 es 	 	of	the	koariti	.
so	,	500	 year 	 s 	 	after	columbus	,	these	ancient	 rhythm 	 s 	 	of	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	are	 play 	 ed 	 	out	in	ritual	.
now	,	when	i	was	here	at	the	first	ted	,	i	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	:	two	men	of	the	elder	 brother 	 s 	 	,	the	 descend 	 ants 	 	,	 surviv 	 ors 	 	of	el	dorado	.
these	,	of	course	,	are	the	 descend 	 ants 	 	of	the	ancient	tairona	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
if	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	here	remember	that	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	that	they	remain	 rul 	 ed 	 	by	a	ritual	 priest 	 hood 	 	,	but	the	training	for	the	 priest 	 hood 	 	is	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.

all	that	time	,	the	world	 on 	 ly 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 abstract 	 ion 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	taught	the	 value 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.

now	,	the	measure	of	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	but	the	quality	of	 it 	 s 	 	 aspir 	 ations 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	back	 in 	 to 	 	these	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	to	see	if	 th 	 is 	 	could	possibly	be	true	,	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	by	the	great	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	,	reichel	-	dolmatoff	.

these	 re 	 ally 	 	are	a	people	who	live	and	breathe	the	realm	of	the	sacred	,	a	 baro 	 que 	 	 relig 	 io 	 s 	 ity 	 	that	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	awesome	.
they	 consum 	 e 	 	more	coca	 leav 	 es 	 	than	any	human	population	,	half	a	pound	per	man	,	per	day	.
the	 go 	 ur 	 d 	 	you	see	here	is	--	 every 	 thing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	is	 symbol 	 ic 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	central	metaphor	is	a	loom	.
they	say	,	``	 up 	 on 	 	 th 	 is 	 	loom	,	i	weave	my	life	.	``
they	refer	to	the	 move 	 ments 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	exploit	the	 eco 	 logical 	 	 niche 	 s 	 	of	the	 grad 	 ient 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	.	``
when	they	pray	for	the	dead	,	they	make	these	 gest 	 ures 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 pinning 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 heaven 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	the	 calc 	 ium 	 	 build 	 up 	 	on	the	head	of	the	 po 	 poro 	 	 go 	 ur 	 d 	 	.
the	 go 	 ur 	 d 	 	is	a	 femin 	 ine 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	;	the	stick	is	a	male	.
you	put	the	stick	in	the	powder	to	take	the	sacred	ashes	--	well	,	they	're	not	ashes	,	they	're	 burn 	 t 	 	 lime 	 stone 	 	--	to	empower	the	coca	leaf	,	to	change	the	ph	of	the	mouth	to	facilitate	the	absorption	of	 coca 	 ine 	 	 hydro 	 chloride 	 	.
but	if	you	break	a	 go 	 ur 	 d 	 	,	you	can	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	throw	it	away	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	stroke	of	that	stick	that	 ha 	 s 	 	built	up	that	 calc 	 ium 	 	,	the	measure	of	a	man	's	life	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	thought	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.

the	other	side	is	 plant 	 ed 	 	like	that	by	the	men	.	 metaphor 	 ically 	 	,	you	turn	it	on	the	side	,	and	you	have	a	piece	of	cloth	.
and	they	are	the	 descend 	 ants 	 	of	the	ancient	tairona	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	 gold 	 smith 	 s 	 	of	south	america	,	who	in	the	wake	of	the	 con 	 quest 	 	,	 re 	 treat 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	 volcan 	 ic 	 	 mass 	 if 	 	that	 soar 	 s 	 	to	20,000	feet	above	the	caribbean	 coast 	 al 	 	plain	.
there	are	four	 socie 	 ties 	 	:	the	kogi	,	the	wiwa	,	the	kankwano	and	the	arhuacos	.
i	 travel 	 ed 	 	with	the	arhuacos	,	and	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	story	was	that	 th 	 is 	 	man	,	danilo	villafane	--	if	we	just	jump	back	here	for	a	second	.
when	i	first	met	danilo	,	in	the	colombian	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	in	washington	,	i	could	n't	help	but	say	,	``	you	know	,	you	look	a	lot	like	an	old	friend	of	mine	.	``
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	he	was	the	son	of	my	friend	,	adalberto	,	from	1974	,	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	the	farc	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	danilo	,	you	wo	n't	remember	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	an	infant	,	i	carried	you	on	my	back	,	up	and	down	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	.	``
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	danilo	 invit 	 ed 	 	us	to	go	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	heart	of	the	world	,	a	place	where	no	journalist	had	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 permit 	 ted 	 	.
not	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	the	 flan 	 k 	 s 	 	of	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	but	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 ic 	 ed 	 	 peak 	 s 	 	which	are	the	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	of	the	pilgrims	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	man	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	cross	-	legged	is	now	a	grown	-	up	eugenio	,	a	man	who	i	've	known	since	1974	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 initi 	 ates 	 	.
no	,	it	's	not	true	that	they	're	 ke 	 pt 	 	in	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	for	18	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	they	are	 ke 	 pt 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 con 	 fine 	 s 	 	of	the	 ceremoni 	 al 	 	men	's	circle	for	18	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	boy	will	never	step	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	sacred	 field 	 s 	 	that	surround	the	men	's	hut	for	all	that	time	,	 un 	 til 	 	he	 begin 	 s 	 	his	journey	of	 initi 	 ation 	 	.
for	that	entire	time	,	the	world	 on 	 ly 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 abstract 	 ion 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	is	taught	the	 value 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 pray 	 ers 	 	 al 	 one 	 	maintain	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	balance	.
before	we	could	begin	our	journey	,	we	had	to	be	 clean 	 s 	 ed 	 	at	the	 port 	 al 	 	of	the	earth	.
and	it	was	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	to	be	taken	by	a	priest	.
and	you	see	that	the	priest	never	 wear 	 s 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	holy	feet	--	there	must	be	 noth 	 ing 	 	between	the	feet	and	the	earth	for	a	mamo	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	place	where	the	great	mother	 s 	 ent 	 	the	 spin 	 d 	 le 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	that	 elev 	 ated 	 	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	and	 create 	 d 	 	the	 home 	 land 	 	that	they	call	the	heart	of	the	world	.
we	 travel 	 ed 	 	high	 in 	 to 	 	the	 para 	 mo 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 crest 	 ed 	 	the	 hill 	 s 	 	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	men	 we 	 re 	 	 interpret 	 ing 	 	every	single	bump	on	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 intens 	 e 	 	 relig 	 io 	 s 	 ity 	 	.
and	then	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 reach 	 ed 	 	our	final	destination	,	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	mamancana	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	for	a	surprise	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	farc	 we 	 re 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	kidnap	us	.
and	so	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	taken	 a 	 side 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 hut 	 s 	 	,	 hid 	 den 	 	away	 un 	 til 	 	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
and	then	,	 abandon 	 ing 	 	all	our	gear	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 force 	 d 	 	to	ride	out	in	the	middle	of	the	night	,	in	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	scene	.
it	's	going	to	look	like	a	john	ford	western	.
and	we	ran	 in 	 to 	 	a	farc	patrol	at	dawn	,	so	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 har 	 row 	 ing 	 	.
it	will	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	film	.	but	what	was	 fasci 	 nating 	 	is	that	the	minute	there	was	a	sense	of	 danger 	 s 	 	,	the	 mamo 	 s 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	a	circle	of	 div 	 in 	 ation 	 	.
and	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	 liter 	 ally 	 	taken	the	night	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	 hid 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	divine	 the 	 ir 	 	route	to	take	us	out	of	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	trained	people	in	 film 	 making 	 	,	 continu 	 e 	 	with	our	work	,	and	 s 	 end 	 	our	wiwa	and	arhuaco	 film 	 makers 	 	to	the	final	sacred	 lake 	 s 	 	to	get	the	last	 shot 	 s 	 	for	the	film	,	and	we	 follow 	 ed 	 	the	rest	of	the	arhuaco	back	to	the	sea	,	taking	the	 element 	 s 	 	from	the	 high 	 land 	 s 	 	to	the	sea	.
and	here	you	see	how	 the 	 ir 	 	sacred	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	 brothel 	 s 	 	and	 hotel 	 s 	 	and	 casino 	 s 	 	,	and	yet	,	still	they	pray	.
and	it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	to	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	close	to	miami	,	two	 hour 	 s 	 	from	miami	,	there	is	an	entire	 civil 	 ization 	 	of	people	 pray 	 ing 	 	every	day	for	your	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
they	call	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	elder	 brother 	 s 	 	.
they	dismiss	the	rest	of	us	who	have	 ruin 	 ed 	 	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	the	 young 	 er 	 	 brother 	 s 	 	.	they	can	not	understand	why	it	is	that	we	do	what	we	do	to	the	earth	.
now	,	if	we	slip	to	 an 	 other 	 	end	of	the	world	,	i	was	up	in	the	high	 arc 	 tic 	 	to	tell	a	story	about	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	inspired	in	part	by	the	 form 	 er 	 	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	book	.
and	what	 s 	 truck 	 	me	so	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	was	to	be	 aga 	 in 	 	with	the	inuit	--	a	people	who	do	n't	fear	the	cold	,	but	take	advantage	of	it	.
a	people	who	find	a	way	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	to	carve	life	out	of	that	 ver 	 y 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	.
a	people	for	whom	blood	on	ice	is	not	a	sign	of	death	,	but	an	 affirm 	 ation 	 	of	life	.
and	yet	 tragic 	 ally 	 	,	when	you	now	go	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 north 	 ern 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	you	find	to	your	 astonish 	 ment 	 	that	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	sea	ice	used	to	come	in	in	september	and	stay	till	july	,	in	a	place	like	kanak	in	 north 	 ern 	 	greenland	,	it	 liter 	 ally 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	now	in	november	and	 stay 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	march	.
so	,	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	year	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	cut	in	half	.
now	,	i	want	to	stress	that	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 people 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	are	 disappear 	 ing 	 	 world 	 s 	 	.
these	are	not	 dy 	 ing 	 	 people 	 s 	 	.
on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	you	know	,	if	you	have	the	heart	to	feel	and	the	 eye 	 s 	 	to	see	,	you	discover	that	the	world	is	not	flat	.
the	world	 remain 	 s 	 	a	rich	 tape 	 stry 	 	.
it	 remain 	 s 	 	a	rich	 top 	 ography 	 	of	the	spirit	.
these	myriad	 voice 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	are	not	 fail 	 ed 	 	 attempt 	 s 	 	at	 be 	 ing 	 	new	,	 fail 	 ed 	 	 attempt 	 s 	 	at	 be 	 ing 	 	modern	.
they	're	 un 	 ique 	 	 facet 	 s 	 	of	the	human	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
they	're	 un 	 ique 	 	 answer 	 s 	 	to	a	fundamental	question	:	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	to	be	human	and	 al 	 ive 	 	?
and	when	 ask 	 ed 	 	that	question	,	they	respond	with	6,000	different	 voice 	 s 	 	.
and	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	our	human	repertoire	for	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	will	confront	us	in	the	 en 	 suing 	 	millennia	.
our	industrial	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	 scarce 	 ly 	 	300	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
that	 sh 	 allow 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	should	n't	suggest	to	 any 	 one 	 	that	we	have	all	of	the	 answer 	 s 	 	for	all	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	will	confront	us	in	the	 en 	 suing 	 	millennia	.
the	myriad	 voice 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	are	not	 fail 	 ed 	 	 attempt 	 s 	 	at	 be 	 ing 	 	us	.
they	are	 un 	 ique 	 	 answer 	 s 	 	to	that	fundamental	question	:	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	to	be	human	and	 al 	 ive 	 	?
and	there	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	a	fire	 burn 	 ing 	 	over	the	earth	,	taking	with	it	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	's	 brilli 	 ance 	 	.
right	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 s 	 it 	 	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	of	 t 	 hose 	 	6,000	 language 	 s 	 	spoken	the	day	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	born	,	fully	half	are	n't	 be 	 ing 	 	taught	to	children	.
so	,	you	're	living	through	a	time	when	 virtual 	 ly 	 	half	of	 human 	 ity 	 	's	intellectual	,	social	and	spiritual	 leg 	 acy 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	slip	away	.
 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	to	happen	.
these	 people 	 s 	 	are	not	 fail 	 ed 	 	 attempt 	 s 	 	at	 be 	 ing 	 	modern	--	 qu 	 ain 	 t 	 	and	 color 	 ful 	 	and	destined	to	 fad 	 e 	 	away	 a 	 s 	 	if	by	natural	law	.
in	every	case	,	these	are	dynamic	,	living	 people 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	driven	out	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	by	 ident 	 ifiable 	 	 force 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	 optimist 	 ic 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	if	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	the	 agent 	 s 	 	of	cultural	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	,	and	must	be	,	the	 facilitator 	 s 	 	of	cultural	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
