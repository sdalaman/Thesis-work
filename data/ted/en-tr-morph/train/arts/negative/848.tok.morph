how	do	you	explain	when	 thing 	 s 	 	do	n't	go	 a 	 s 	 	we	 assum 	 e 	 	?
or	better	,	how	do	you	explain	when	 other 	 s 	 	are	able	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	seem	to	defy	all	of	the	 assumption 	 s 	 	?
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	why	is	apple	so	 innov 	 ative 	 	?
year	after	year	,	after	year	,	after	year	,	they	're	more	 innov 	 ative 	 	than	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	.
and	yet	,	they	're	just	a	computer	company	.
they	're	just	like	 every 	 one 	 	else	.
they	have	the	same	access	to	the	same	talent	,	the	same	 age 	 ncies 	 	,	the	same	 consult 	 ants 	 	,	the	same	media	.
then	why	is	it	that	they	seem	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	different	?
why	is	it	that	martin	luther	king	led	the	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	?
he	was	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	man	who	 suffer 	 ed 	 	in	a	pre	-	civil	 right 	 s 	 	america	,	and	he	 certain 	 ly 	 	was	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	great	 or 	 ator 	 	of	the	day	.
and	why	is	it	that	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	figure	out	controlled	,	powered	man	flight	when	there	 we 	 re 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	other	 team 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	better	 qual 	 ified 	 	,	better	funded	...
and	they	did	n't	 achiev 	 e 	 	powered	man	flight	,	and	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	beat	them	to	it	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	at	play	here	.
about	three	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	made	a	 discover 	 y 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	my	view	on	how	i	thought	the	world	 work 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	even	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	in	which	i	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	there	's	a	pattern	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	all	the	great	and	inspiring	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	in	the	world	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	apple	or	martin	luther	king	or	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	--	they	all	think	,	act	and	communicate	the	exact	same	way	.
and	it	's	the	complete	 oppos 	 ite 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	else	.
all	i	did	was	 cod 	 ify 	 	it	,	and	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	world	's	 simpl 	 est 	 	idea	.
i	call	it	the	 gold 	 en 	 	circle	.
why	?	how	?	what	?
 th 	 is 	 	little	idea	 explain 	 s 	 	why	some	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	some	 lead 	 ers 	 	are	able	to	inspire	where	 other 	 s 	 	are	n't	.
let	me	define	the	 term 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
every	single	person	,	every	single	 organ 	 ization 	 	on	the	planet	 know 	 s 	 	what	they	do	,	100	percent	.
some	know	how	they	do	it	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	call	it	your	 different 	 iated 	 	value	 pro 	 position 	 	or	your	 prop 	 riet 	 ary 	 	process	or	your	usp	.
but	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	or	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	know	why	they	do	what	they	do	.
and	by	``	why	``	i	do	n't	mean	``	to	make	a	profit	.	``
that	's	a	result	.	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	a	result	.
by	``	why	,	``	i	mean	:	what	's	your	purpose	?
what	's	your	cause	?	what	's	your	belief	?
why	 do 	 es 	 	your	 organ 	 ization 	 	exist	?
why	do	you	get	out	of	bed	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	?
and	why	should	 any 	 one 	 	care	?
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	the	way	we	think	,	the	way	we	act	,	the	way	we	communicate	is	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	in	.
it	's	obvious	.	we	go	from	the	 clear 	 est 	 	thing	to	the	 fuzz 	 iest 	 	thing	.
but	the	inspired	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	the	inspired	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	--	 regard 	 less 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	industry	--	all	think	,	act	and	communicate	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	out	.
let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
i	use	apple	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	easy	to	understand	and	 every 	 body 	 	 get 	 s 	 	it	.
if	apple	 we 	 re 	 	like	 every 	 one 	 	else	,	a	 market 	 ing 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	from	them	might	sound	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	we	make	great	 computer 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	designed	,	simple	to	use	and	user	friendly	.
want	to	buy	one	?	``	``	meh	.	``
and	that	's	how	most	of	us	communicate	.
that	's	how	most	 market 	 ing 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	,	that	's	how	most	 sale 	 s 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	and	that	's	how	most	of	us	communicate	 inter 	 personal 	 ly 	 	.
we	say	what	we	do	,	we	say	how	we	're	different	or	how	we	're	better	and	we	expect	some	sort	of	a	behavior	,	a	purchase	,	a	vote	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
here	's	our	new	law	firm	:	we	have	the	best	 lawyer 	 s 	 	with	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 client 	 s 	 	,	we	 al 	 ways 	 	perform	for	our	 client 	 s 	 	who	do	business	with	us	.

but	it	's	 un 	 inspiring 	 	.
here	's	how	apple	 actual 	 ly 	 	 communicate 	 s 	 	.
``	 every 	 thing 	 	we	do	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 challeng 	 ing 	 	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 think 	 ing 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
the	way	we	 challeng 	 e 	 	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	is	by	making	our	 product 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	designed	,	simple	to	use	and	user	friendly	.
we	just	happen	to	make	great	 computer 	 s 	 	.
want	to	buy	one	?	``
 total 	 ly 	 	different	right	?	you	're	ready	to	buy	a	computer	from	me	.
all	i	did	was	reverse	the	order	of	the	information	.
what	it	 prove 	 s 	 	to	us	is	that	people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	people	buy	why	you	do	it	.
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	why	every	single	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	is	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	computer	from	apple	.
but	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	an	mp	3	player	from	apple	,	or	a	phone	from	apple	,	or	a	dvr	from	apple	.
but	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	before	,	apple	's	just	a	computer	company	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	 distinguish 	 es 	 	them	 structural 	 ly 	 	from	any	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 competitor 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 competitor 	 s 	 	are	all	 equal 	 ly 	 	 qual 	 ified 	 	to	make	all	of	these	 product 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 gate 	 way 	 	came	out	with	flat	screen	tvs	.
they	're	 eminent 	 ly 	 	 qual 	 ified 	 	to	make	flat	screen	tvs	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	making	flat	screen	 monitor 	 s 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	one	.
dell	came	out	with	mp	3	 player 	 s 	 	and	pdas	,	and	they	make	great	quality	 product 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	make	 perfect 	 ly 	 	well	-	designed	 product 	 s 	 	--	and	 no 	 body 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	one	.
in	fact	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	now	,	we	ca	n't	even	imagine	 buy 	 ing 	 	an	mp	3	player	from	dell	.
why	would	you	buy	an	mp	3	player	from	a	computer	company	?
but	we	do	it	every	day	.
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	.
the	goal	is	not	to	do	business	with	 every 	 body 	 	who	 need 	 s 	 	what	you	have	.
the	goal	is	to	do	business	with	people	who	 believ 	 e 	 	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	.
here	's	the	best	part	:	 non 	 e 	 	of	what	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	is	my	opinion	.
it	's	all	 ground 	 ed 	 	in	the	 ten 	 et 	 s 	 	of	biology	.
not	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	biology	.
if	you	look	at	a	cross	-	section	of	the	human	brain	,	looking	from	the	top	down	,	what	you	see	is	the	human	brain	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	broken	 in 	 to 	 	three	major	 component 	 s 	 	that	correlate	 perfect 	 ly 	 	with	the	 gold 	 en 	 	circle	.
our	 new 	 est 	 	brain	,	our	homo	sapien	brain	,	our	 neo 	 cortex 	 	,	 correspond 	 s 	 	with	the	``	what	``	level	.
the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	all	of	our	rational	and	 analytic 	 al 	 	thought	and	language	.
the	middle	two	 section 	 s 	 	make	up	our	 limb 	 ic 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	,	and	our	 limb 	 ic 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	all	of	our	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	like	trust	and	 loyal 	 ty 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	all	human	behavior	,	all	decision	-	making	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	language	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	when	we	communicate	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	in	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	people	can	understand	vast	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 complic 	 ated 	 	information	like	 feature 	 s 	 	and	 benefit 	 s 	 	and	 fact 	 s 	 	and	 figure 	 s 	 	.
it	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	drive	behavior	.
when	we	can	communicate	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	out	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	part	of	the	brain	that	 control 	 s 	 	behavior	,	and	then	we	allow	people	to	 rational 	 ize 	 	it	with	the	tangible	 thing 	 s 	 	we	say	and	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	gut	 decision 	 s 	 	come	from	.
you	know	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	can	give	 some 	 body 	 	all	the	 fact 	 s 	 	and	 figure 	 s 	 	,	and	they	say	,	``	i	know	what	all	the	 fact 	 s 	 	and	 detail 	 s 	 	say	,	but	it	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	feel	right	.	``
why	would	we	use	that	verb	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	``	feel	``	right	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	part	of	the	brain	that	 control 	 s 	 	decision	-	making	 do 	 es 	 	n't	control	language	.
and	the	best	we	can	 must 	 er 	 	up	is	,	``	i	do	n't	know	.	it	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	feel	right	.	``
or	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	say	you	're	 lead 	 ing 	 	with	your	heart	,	or	you	're	 lead 	 ing 	 	with	your	soul	.
well	,	i	hate	to	break	it	to	you	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	n't	other	body	 part 	 s 	 	 controll 	 ing 	 	your	behavior	.
it	's	all	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	in	your	 limb 	 ic 	 	brain	,	the	part	of	the	brain	that	 control 	 s 	 	decision	-	making	and	not	language	.
but	if	you	do	n't	know	why	you	do	what	you	do	,	and	people	respond	to	why	you	do	what	you	do	,	then	how	will	you	ever	get	people	to	vote	for	you	,	or	buy	 some 	 thing 	 	from	you	,	or	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	be	loyal	and	want	to	be	a	part	of	what	it	is	that	you	do	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	goal	is	not	just	to	sell	to	people	who	need	what	you	have	;	the	goal	is	to	sell	to	people	who	 believ 	 e 	 	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	.
the	goal	is	not	just	to	hire	people	who	need	a	job	;	it	's	to	hire	people	who	 believ 	 e 	 	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	say	that	,	you	know	,	if	you	hire	people	just	 be 	 cause 	 	they	can	do	a	job	,	they	'll	work	for	your	money	,	but	if	you	hire	people	who	 believ 	 e 	 	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	,	they	'll	work	for	you	with	blood	and	sweat	and	 tear 	 s 	 	.
and	 no 	 where 	 	else	is	there	a	better	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	than	with	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	.
most	people	do	n't	know	about	samuel	pierpont	langley	.
and	back	in	the	early	20th	century	,	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	powered	man	flight	was	like	the	dot	com	of	the	day	.
 every 	 body 	 	was	 try 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	samuel	pierpont	langley	had	,	what	we	 assum 	 e 	 	,	to	be	the	recipe	for	success	.
i	mean	,	even	now	,	you	ask	people	,	``	why	did	your	product	or	why	did	your	company	fail	?	``
and	people	 al 	 ways 	 	give	you	the	same	 per 	 mutation 	 	of	the	same	three	 thing 	 s 	 	:	under	-	 capital 	 ized 	 	,	the	wrong	people	,	bad	market	 condition 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	three	 thing 	 s 	 	,	so	let	's	explore	that	.
samuel	pierpont	langley	was	 give 	 n 	 	50,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	by	the	war	 depart 	 ment 	 	to	figure	out	 th 	 is 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	machine	.
money	was	no	problem	.
he	held	a	seat	at	harvard	and	 work 	 ed 	 	at	the	smithsonian	and	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	-	 connect 	 ed 	 	;	he	 k 	 new 	 	all	the	big	 mind 	 s 	 	of	the	day	.
he	 hire 	 d 	 	the	best	 mind 	 s 	 	money	could	find	and	the	market	 condition 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	fantastic	.
the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	him	around	 every 	 where 	 	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	was	 root 	 ing 	 	for	langley	.
then	how	come	we	've	never	heard	of	samuel	pierpont	langley	?
a	few	hundred	 mile 	 s 	 	away	in	dayton	ohio	,	orville	and	wilbur	wright	,	they	had	 non 	 e 	 	of	what	we	consider	to	be	the	recipe	for	success	.
they	had	no	money	;	they	paid	for	 the 	 ir 	 	dream	with	the	 proceed 	 s 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 bi 	 cycle 	 	shop	;	not	a	single	person	on	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	'	team	had	a	college	education	,	not	even	orville	or	wilbur	;	and	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	them	around	 no 	 where 	 	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	was	,	orville	and	wilbur	 we 	 re 	 	driven	by	a	cause	,	by	a	purpose	,	by	a	belief	.
they	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	if	they	could	figure	out	 th 	 is 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	machine	,	it	'll	change	the	course	of	the	world	.
samuel	pierpont	langley	was	different	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	rich	,	and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	famous	.
he	was	in	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	the	result	.
he	was	in	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	the	 rich 	 es 	 	.
and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	look	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
the	people	who	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	'	dream	 work 	 ed 	 	with	them	with	blood	and	sweat	and	 tear 	 s 	 	.
the	 other 	 s 	 	just	 work 	 ed 	 	for	the	 pay 	 check 	 	.
and	they	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	of	how	every	time	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	went	out	,	they	would	have	to	take	five	 set 	 s 	 	of	 part 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	how	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	they	would	crash	before	they	came	in	for	 s 	 upper 	 	.
and	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	on	december	17th	,	1903	,	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	took	flight	,	and	no	one	was	there	to	even	experience	it	.
we	found	out	about	it	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	further	proof	that	langley	was	 motiv 	 ated 	 	by	the	wrong	thing	:	the	day	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	took	flight	,	he	quit	.
he	could	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	,	 guy 	 s 	 	,	and	i	will	improve	 up 	 on 	 	your	technology	,	``	but	he	did	n't	.
he	was	n't	first	,	he	did	n't	get	rich	,	he	did	n't	get	famous	so	he	quit	.
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	.
and	if	you	talk	about	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	,	you	will	attract	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 believ 	 e 	 	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	.
but	why	is	it	 import 	 ant 	 	to	attract	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 believ 	 e 	 	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	?
 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	law	of	diffusion	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	and	if	you	do	n't	know	the	law	,	you	 definite 	 ly 	 	know	the	 term 	 in 	 ology 	 	.
the	first	two	and	a	half	percent	of	our	population	are	our	 innov 	 ators 	 	.
the	next	13	and	a	half	percent	of	our	population	are	our	early	 adopt 	 ers 	 	.
the	next	34	percent	are	your	early	 major 	 ity 	 	,	your	late	 major 	 ity 	 	and	your	laggards	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	reason	these	people	buy	touch	tone	 phone 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	buy	 rot 	 ary 	 	 phone 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
we	all	 s 	 it 	 	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 place 	 s 	 	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 time 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	scale	,	but	what	the	law	of	diffusion	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	is	that	if	you	want	mass	-	market	success	or	mass	-	market	 accept 	 ance 	 	of	an	idea	,	you	can	not	have	it	 un 	 til 	 	you	 achiev 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 tip 	 ping 	 	point	between	15	and	18	percent	market	 penet 	 ration 	 	,	and	then	the	system	 tip 	 s 	 	.
and	i	love	 ask 	 ing 	 	 business 	 es 	 	,	``	what	's	your	 con 	 version 	 	on	new	business	?	``
and	they	love	to	tell	you	,	``	oh	,	it	's	about	10	percent	,	``	 proud 	 ly 	 	.
well	,	you	can	trip	over	10	percent	of	the	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
we	all	have	about	10	percent	who	just	``	get	it	.	``
that	's	how	we	 de 	 scribe 	 	them	,	right	?
that	's	like	that	gut	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	,	they	just	get	it	.	``
the	problem	is	:	how	do	you	find	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	get	it	before	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	business	with	them	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	do	n't	get	it	?
so	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	little	gap	that	you	have	to	close	,	 a 	 s 	 	jeffrey	moore	 call 	 s 	 	it	,	``	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	 cha 	 sm 	 	``	--	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	see	,	the	early	 major 	 ity 	 	will	not	try	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 some 	 one 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	first	.
and	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	the	 innov 	 ators 	 	and	the	early	 adopt 	 ers 	 	,	they	're	 comfort 	 able 	 	making	 t 	 hose 	 	gut	 decision 	 s 	 	.
they	're	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	making	 t 	 hose 	 	intuitive	 decision 	 s 	 	that	are	driven	by	what	they	 believ 	 e 	 	about	the	world	and	not	just	what	product	is	 avail 	 able 	 	.
these	are	the	people	who	stood	in	line	for	six	 hour 	 s 	 	to	buy	an	iphone	when	they	first	came	out	,	when	you	could	have	just	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	store	the	next	week	and	 b 	 ought 	 	one	off	the	shelf	.
these	are	the	people	who	 s 	 pent 	 	40,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	flat	screen	tvs	when	they	first	came	out	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	technology	was	 sub 	 standard 	 	.
and	,	by	the	way	,	they	did	n't	do	it	 be 	 cause 	 	the	technology	was	so	great	;	they	did	it	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	first	.
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	and	what	you	do	 simpl 	 y 	 	 prove 	 s 	 	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	.
in	fact	,	people	will	do	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	prove	what	they	 believ 	 e 	 	.
the	reason	that	person	 b 	 ought 	 	the	iphone	in	the	first	six	 hour 	 s 	 	,	stood	in	line	for	six	 hour 	 s 	 	,	was	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	about	the	world	,	and	how	they	 want 	 ed 	 	 every 	 body 	 	to	see	them	:	they	 we 	 re 	 	first	.
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	.
so	let	me	give	you	a	famous	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	famous	failure	and	a	famous	success	of	the	law	of	diffusion	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
first	,	the	famous	failure	.
it	's	a	commercial	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	 s 	 aid 	 	before	,	a	second	ago	,	the	recipe	for	success	is	money	and	the	right	people	and	the	right	market	 condition 	 s 	 	,	right	?	you	should	have	success	then	.
look	at	tivo	.
from	the	time	tivo	came	out	about	eight	or	nine	 year 	 s 	 	ago	to	 th 	 is 	 	current	day	,	they	are	the	single	highest	-	quality	product	on	the	market	,	 hand 	 s 	 	down	,	there	is	no	 disput 	 e 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	-	funded	.
market	 condition 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	fantastic	.
i	mean	,	we	use	tivo	 a 	 s 	 	verb	.
i	tivo	stuff	on	my	piece	of	junk	time	warner	dvr	all	the	time	.
but	tivo	's	a	commercial	failure	.
they	've	never	made	money	.
and	when	they	went	ipo	,	 the 	 ir 	 	stock	was	at	about	30	or	40	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	then	 plummet 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	's	never	 trade 	 d 	 	above	10	.
in	fact	,	i	do	n't	think	it	's	even	 trade 	 d 	 	above	six	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	a	couple	of	little	 spike 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	see	,	when	tivo	 launch 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	product	they	told	us	all	what	they	had	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	have	a	product	that	 pause 	 s 	 	live	tv	,	 skip 	 s 	 	 commercial 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 wind 	 s 	 	live	tv	and	 memor 	 ize 	 s 	 	your	 view 	 ing 	 	 habit 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	you	even	 ask 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	the	 cynic 	 al 	 	 major 	 ity 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	you	.
we	do	n't	need	it	.	we	do	n't	like	it	.
you	're	 scar 	 ing 	 	us	.	``
what	if	they	had	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	're	the	kind	of	person	who	 like 	 s 	 	to	have	total	control	over	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	your	life	,	boy	,	do	we	have	a	product	for	you	.
it	 pause 	 s 	 	live	tv	,	 skip 	 s 	 	 commercial 	 s 	 	,	 memor 	 ize 	 s 	 	your	 view 	 ing 	 	 habit 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	 etc 	 . 	 	``
people	do	n't	buy	what	you	do	;	they	buy	why	you	do	it	,	and	what	you	do	 simpl 	 y 	 	 serve 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	proof	of	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	.
now	let	me	give	you	a	 success 	 ful 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	law	of	diffusion	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
in	the	summer	of	1963	,	250,000	people	 show 	 ed 	 	up	on	the	mall	in	washington	to	hear	dr.	king	speak	.
they	 s 	 ent 	 	out	no	 invit 	 ations 	 	,	and	there	was	no	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	to	check	the	date	.
how	do	you	do	that	?
well	,	dr.	king	was	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	man	in	america	who	was	a	great	 or 	 ator 	 	.
he	was	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	man	in	america	who	 suffer 	 ed 	 	in	a	pre	-	civil	 right 	 s 	 	america	.
in	fact	,	some	of	his	 idea 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	bad	.
but	he	had	a	gift	.
he	did	n't	go	around	 tell 	 ing 	 	people	what	 need 	 ed 	 	to	change	in	america	.
he	went	around	and	told	people	what	he	 believ 	 ed 	 	.
``	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	``	he	told	people	.
and	people	who	 believ 	 ed 	 	what	he	 believ 	 ed 	 	took	his	cause	,	and	they	made	it	 the 	 ir 	 	own	,	and	they	told	people	.
and	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 create 	 d 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	to	get	the	word	out	to	even	more	people	.
and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	250,000	people	 show 	 ed 	 	up	on	the	right	day	at	the	right	time	to	hear	him	speak	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	 show 	 ed 	 	up	for	him	?
zero	.
they	 show 	 ed 	 	up	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
it	's	what	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	about	america	that	got	them	to	travel	in	a	bus	for	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	to	stand	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	in	washington	in	the	middle	of	august	.
it	's	what	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	was	n't	about	black	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	white	:	25	percent	of	the	audience	was	white	.
dr.	king	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	there	are	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	 law 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	:	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	made	by	a	 high 	 er 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	made	by	man	.
and	not	 un 	 til 	 	all	the	 law 	 s 	 	that	are	made	by	man	are	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	the	 law 	 s 	 	that	are	made	by	the	 high 	 er 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	will	we	live	in	a	just	world	.
it	just	so	 happen 	 ed 	 	that	the	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	was	the	perfect	thing	to	help	him	 br 	 ing 	 	his	cause	to	life	.
we	 follow 	 ed 	 	,	not	for	him	,	but	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	,	by	the	way	,	he	 g 	 ave 	 	the	``	i	have	a	dream	``	speech	,	not	the	``	i	have	a	plan	``	speech	.
listen	to	 politic 	 ians 	 	now	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	12	-	point	 plan 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	inspiring	 any 	 body 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	there	are	 t 	 hose 	 	who	lead	.
 lead 	 ers 	 	hold	a	position	of	power	or	 author 	 ity 	 	,	but	 t 	 hose 	 	who	lead	inspire	us	.
 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	 individual 	 s 	 	or	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	we	follow	 t 	 hose 	 	who	lead	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	to	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	to	.
we	follow	 t 	 hose 	 	who	lead	,	not	for	them	,	but	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	it	's	 t 	 hose 	 	who	start	with	``	why	``	that	have	the	ability	to	inspire	 t 	 hose 	 	around	them	or	find	 other 	 s 	 	who	inspire	them	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
