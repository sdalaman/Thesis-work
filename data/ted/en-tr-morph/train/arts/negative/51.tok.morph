the	new	story	about	climate	 protect 	 ion 	 	is	that	it	's	not	 cost 	 ly 	 	,	but	 profit 	 able 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	simple	sign	error	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 cheap 	 er 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	fuel	than	to	buy	fuel	,	 a 	 s 	 	is	well	known	to	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	do	it	all	the	time	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	dupont	,	sd	micro	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.

that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	profit	.
now	,	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	the	old	story	about	oil	is	that	if	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	of	it	,	it	would	be	expensive	,	or	we	would	have	 d 	 one 	 	it	 al 	 ready 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 market 	 s 	 	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	perfect	.
if	,	of	course	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	true	,	there	would	be	no	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	could	make	any	money	.
but	the	new	story	about	oil	is	the	government	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	force	us	to	do	 pain 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	get	off	oil	--	not	just	 increment 	 ally 	 	,	but	 complete 	 ly 	 	--	 quit 	 e 	 	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	.	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	can	 complete 	 ly 	 	eliminate	 it 	 s 	 	use	of	oil	and	 rejuve 	 n 	 ate 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	at	the	same	time	,	led	by	business	for	profit	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	much	 cheap 	 er 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	and	 substitut 	 e 	 	for	the	oil	than	to	keep	on	 buy 	 ing 	 	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	process	will	 al 	 so 	 	be	 catalyze 	 d 	 	by	the	 militar 	 y 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	own	 reason 	 s 	 	of	combat	 effective 	 ness 	 	and	 prevent 	 ing 	 	conflict	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	over	oil	.

now	,	a	bit	of	economic	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	i	think	,	may	be	 help 	 ful 	 	here	.
around	1850	,	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	u.s.	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	was	 whal 	 ing 	 	.
and	whale	oil	lit	 practical 	 ly 	 	every	building	.
but	in	the	nine	 year 	 s 	 	before	drake	 s 	 truck 	 	oil	,	in	1859	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	five	-	 sixth 	 s 	 	of	that	whale	oil	-	 illumi 	 nating 	 	market	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	fatal	 competitor 	 s 	 	,	 chief 	 ly 	 	oil	and	gas	made	from	coal	,	to	which	the	 whal 	 ers 	 	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	.
so	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 ly 	 	,	they	ran	out	of	 custom 	 ers 	 	before	they	ran	out	of	 whale 	 s 	 	.
the	remnant	whale	 population 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	 techno 	 logical 	 	 innov 	 ators 	 	and	profit	-	 maxim 	 izing 	 	 capital 	 ists 	 	.
and	it	's	funny	--	it	 feel 	 s 	 	a	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	now	for	oil	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	the	last	few	 decade 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ating 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 back 	 log 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	saving	and	 substitut 	 ing 	 	for	oil	,	and	no	one	had	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	add	them	up	before	.
so	when	we	did	,	we	found	some	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	,	there	are	two	big	 reason 	 s 	 	to	be	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	oil	.
both	national	 competitive 	 ness 	 	and	national	security	are	at	risk	.
on	the	 competitive 	 ness 	 	front	,	we	all	know	that	toyota	 ha 	 s 	 	more	market	cap	than	the	big	three	put	together	.
and	serious	 com 	 petition 	 	from	europe	,	from	korea	,	and	next	is	 chin 	 a 	 	,	which	will	soon	be	a	major	net	 export 	 er 	 	of	 car 	 s 	 	.
how	long	do	you	think	it	will	take	before	you	can	drive	home	your	new	wally	-	badged	shanghai	 auto 	 motive 	 	super	-	efficient	car	?
 may 	 be 	 	a	decade	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	my	 friend 	 s 	 	in	detroit	.
 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	energy	policy	based	on	radical	energy	efficiency	and	leap	-	frog	technology	.
they	're	not	going	to	export	your	uncle	's	buick	.
and	after	that	 come 	 s 	 	india	.
the	point	here	is	,	these	 car 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	made	super	efficient	.
the	question	is	,	who	will	make	them	?
will	we	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	import	efficient	 car 	 s 	 	to	replace	foreign	oil	,	or	will	we	make	efficient	 car 	 s 	 	and	import	 n 	 either 	 	the	oil	nor	the	 car 	 s 	 	?
that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	make	more	sense	.
the	more	we	keep	on	using	the	oil	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	 import 	 ed 	 	oil	,	the	more	we	face	a	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	array	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
our	analysis	 assum 	 es 	 	that	they	all	cost	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	not	the	right	number	.
it	could	well	be	 en 	 ough 	 	to	double	the	oil	price	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
and	one	of	the	worst	of	these	is	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	to	our	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	if	other	 count 	 ries 	 	think	that	 every 	 thing 	 	we	do	is	about	oil	,	if	we	have	to	treat	 count 	 ries 	 	that	have	oil	 different 	 ly 	 	than	 count 	 ries 	 	that	do	n't	have	oil	.
and	our	 militar 	 y 	 	get	 quit 	 e 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	with	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	stand	guard	on	 pipe 	 lines 	 	in	far	-	off	-	istan	when	what	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	for	was	to	protect	american	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
they	do	n't	like	 fight 	 ing 	 	over	oil	,	they	do	n't	like	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	 sand 	 s 	 	and	they	do	n't	like	where	the	oil	money	 go 	 es 	 	and	what	sort	of	 in 	 st 	 ability 	 	it	 create 	 s 	 	.
now	,	in	order	to	avoid	these	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	you	think	they	're	worth	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	that	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	half	the	oil	by	using	it	more	 efficient 	 ly 	 	,	at	a	cost	of	12	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	barrel	.
and	then	we	can	replace	the	other	half	with	a	combination	of	 advance 	 d 	 	bio	-	 fuel 	 s 	 	and	safe	natural	gas	.
and	that	 cost 	 s 	 	on	average	under	18	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	barrel	.
and	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	the	official	 fore 	 cast 	 	,	that	oil	will	cost	26	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	barrel	in	2025	,	which	is	half	of	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	 late 	 ly 	 	,	that	will	 s 	 ave 	 	70	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	,	 start 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	soon	.
now	,	in	order	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	we	need	to	invest	about	180	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	:	half	of	it	to	 re 	 tool 	 	the	car	,	truck	and	plane	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	;	half	of	it	to	build	the	 advance 	 d 	 	bio	-	fuel	industry	.
in	the	process	,	we	will	gain	about	a	million	good	 job 	 s 	 	,	 main 	 ly 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	.
and	protect	 an 	 other 	 	million	 job 	 s 	 	now	at	risk	,	 main 	 ly 	 	in	auto	-	making	.
and	we	'll	 al 	 so 	 	get	 return 	 s 	 	over	150	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.
so	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 hand 	 some 	 	return	.
it	's	 finance 	 able 	 	in	the	private	capital	market	.
but	if	you	want	it	for	the	 reason 	 s 	 	i	just	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	to	happen	 soon 	 er 	 	and	with	 high 	 er 	 	confidence	,	then	--	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	expand	choice	and	manage	risk	--	then	you	might	like	some	light	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	public	 poli 	 cies 	 	that	support	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 distort 	 ing 	 	or	 oppos 	 ing 	 	the	business	logic	.
and	these	 poli 	 cies 	 	work	fine	 with 	 out 	 	 tax 	 es 	 	,	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	or	 man 	 date 	 s 	 	.
they	make	a	little	net	money	for	the	 treasu 	 ry 	 	.
they	have	a	broad	trans	-	 ideo 	 logical 	 	appeal	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	them	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	happen	,	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	ways	to	do	them	that	do	not	 requir 	 e 	 	much	,	if	any	,	federal	 legisl 	 ation 	 	,	and	can	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	be	 d 	 one 	 	 administr 	 ative 	 ly 	 	or	at	a	state	level	.
just	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	what	to	do	about	the	nub	of	the	problem	,	 name 	 ly 	 	,	light	 vehicle 	 s 	 	,	here	are	four	ultra	-	light	carbon	-	composite	 con 	 cept 	 	 car 	 s 	 	with	low	drag	,	and	all	but	the	one	at	the	upper	left	have	hybrid	drive	.
you	can	sort	of	have	it	all	with	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	opel	two	-	seater	 do 	 es 	 	155	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	at	94	 mile 	 s 	 	a	gallon	.
 th 	 is 	 	muscle	car	from	toyota	:	408	 horse 	 power 	 	in	an	ultra	-	light	that	 do 	 es 	 	zero	to	60	in	well	under	four	 second 	 s 	 	,	and	still	 get 	 s 	 	32	 mile 	 s 	 	a	gallon	.	i	'll	say	more	 lat 	 er 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	in	the	upper	left	,	a	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	effort	14	 year 	 s 	 	ago	by	gm	--	84	 mile 	 s 	 	a	gallon	 with 	 out 	 	even	using	a	hybrid	,	in	a	four	-	seater	.
well	,	saving	that	fuel	,	69	percent	of	the	fuel	in	light	 vehicle 	 s 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	about	57	 cent 	 s 	 	per	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	gallon	.
but	it	's	even	a	better	deal	for	heavy	 truck 	 s 	 	,	where	you	 s 	 ave 	 	a	similar	amount	at	25	 cent 	 s 	 	a	gallon	,	with	better	 aero 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	and	 tire 	 s 	 	and	 engine 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	,	and	taking	out	weight	so	you	can	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	 pay 	 load 	 	.
so	you	can	double	efficiency	with	a	60	percent	internal	rate	of	return	.
then	you	can	go	even	further	,	 al 	 most 	 	 trip 	 ling 	 	efficiency	with	some	 operation 	 al 	 	 improve 	 ments 	 	,	double	the	big	 haul 	 ers 	 	'	 margin 	 s 	 	.
and	we	intend	to	use	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	to	create	demand	pull	,	and	flip	the	market	.
in	the	 air 	 plane 	 	business	,	it	's	 aga 	 in 	 	a	similar	story	where	the	first	20	percent	fuel	saving	is	free	,	 a 	 s 	 	boeing	is	now	 demonst 	 rating 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	new	dreamliner	.
but	then	the	next	generation	of	 plane 	 s 	 	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	about	half	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	much	 cheap 	 er 	 	than	 buy 	 ing 	 	the	fuel	.
and	if	you	go	over	the	next	15	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	to	a	 blend 	 ed 	 	-	wing	body	,	kind	of	a	 fly 	 ing 	 	wing	with	internal	 engine 	 s 	 	,	then	you	get	about	a	factor	three	efficiency	 improve 	 ment 	 	at	 compar 	 able 	 	or	lower	cost	.
let	me	focus	a	minute	on	the	light	 vehicle 	 s 	 	,	the	 car 	 s 	 	and	light	 truck 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	know	the	most	about	 t 	 hose 	 	;	and	yet	we	may	not	 real 	 ize 	 	that	in	a	standard	 s 	 ed 	 an 	 	,	of	all	the	fuel	energy	you	feed	 in 	 to 	 	the	car	,	seven	-	eighths	never	 get 	 s 	 	to	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	;	it	's	lost	first	in	the	engine	,	 idl 	 ing 	 	at	zero	 mile 	 s 	 	a	gallon	,	the	power	train	and	 access 	 ories 	 	.
so	then	of	the	energy	that	 do 	 es 	 	get	to	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	an	eighth	of	it	,	half	of	that	,	 go 	 es 	 	to	heat	the	 tire 	 s 	 	on	the	road	,	or	to	heat	the	air	the	car	 push 	 es 	 	 a 	 side 	 	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	bit	,	 on 	 ly 	 	six	percent	 actual 	 ly 	 	 end 	 s 	 	up	 accele 	 rating 	 	the	car	and	then	 heat 	 ing 	 	the	 brake 	 s 	 	when	you	stop	.
in	fact	,	since	95	percent	of	the	weight	you	're	moving	is	the	car	not	the	driver	,	less	than	one	percent	of	the	fuel	energy	 end 	 s 	 	up	moving	the	driver	.
after	more	than	a	century	of	 devote 	 d 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	effort	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	three	-	fourths	of	the	fuel	use	is	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	the	weight	of	the	car	.
and	it	's	obvious	from	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	that	every	unit	of	energy	you	 s 	 ave 	 	at	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	is	going	to	avoid	 was 	 ting 	 	 an 	 other 	 	seven	 unit 	 s 	 	of	energy	 get 	 ting 	 	that	energy	to	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	.
so	there	's	huge	leverage	for	making	the	car	a	lot	 light 	 er 	 	.
and	the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	 examine 	 d 	 	before	is	there	was	a	common	assumption	in	the	industry	that	--	well	,	then	it	might	not	be	safe	if	you	got	 whack 	 ed 	 	by	a	heavy	car	,	and	it	would	cost	a	lot	more	to	make	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	we	know	how	to	make	 car 	 s 	 	much	 light 	 er 	 	was	to	use	expensive	light	 metal 	 s 	 	like	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	and	 magn 	 es 	 ium 	 	.
but	these	 object 	 ions 	 	are	now	 vanish 	 ing 	 	through	 advance 	 s 	 	in	 material 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	use	a	lot	of	carbon	-	fiber	 composite 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 port 	 ing 	 	 good 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	these	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	for	 safe 	 ty 	 	.
here	's	a	 hand 	 made 	 	mclaren	slr	carbon	car	that	got	t	-	boned	by	a	golf	.
the	golf	was	 total 	 ed 	 	.
the	mclaren	just	 pop 	 ped 	 	off	and	 scratch 	 ed 	 	the	side	 pan 	 el 	 	.
they	'll	pop	it	back	on	and	fix	the	scratch	 lat 	 er 	 	.
but	if	 th 	 is 	 	mclaren	 we 	 re 	 	to	run	 in 	 to 	 	a	wall	at	65	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	the	entire	crash	energy	would	be	 absorb 	 ed 	 	by	a	couple	of	 wove 	 n 	 	carbon	-	fiber	composite	 con 	 es 	 	,	 weigh 	 ing 	 	a	total	of	15	 pound 	 s 	 	,	 hid 	 den 	 	in	the	front	end	.
 be 	 cause 	 	these	 material 	 s 	 	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	absorb	six	to	12	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	energy	per	pound	 a 	 s 	 	steel	,	and	do	so	a	lot	more	 smooth 	 ly 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	we	've	just	 crack 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 un 	 drum 	 	of	 safe 	 ty 	 	and	weight	.
we	could	make	 car 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	,	which	is	 protect 	 ive 	 	,	but	make	them	light	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	made	them	heavy	,	they	'd	be	both	 hostil 	 e 	 	and	 in 	 efficient 	 	.
and	when	you	make	them	light	in	the	right	way	,	that	can	be	 simpl 	 er 	 	and	 cheap 	 er 	 	to	make	.
you	can	end	up	saving	money	,	and	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	oil	,	all	at	the	same	time	.
i	 show 	 ed 	 	here	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	a	little	bit	about	a	design	of	your	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	 un 	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	,	quintupled	-	efficiency	 sub 	 urban 	 	-	assault	vehicle	--	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	complete	virtual	design	that	is	production	-	costed	 manufactur 	 able 	 	.
and	the	process	 need 	 ed 	 	to	make	it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	coming	 to 	 ward 	 	the	market	 quit 	 e 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	a	kind	of	a	digital	 ink 	 jet 	 	 print 	 er 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	stiff	,	strong	,	carbon	-	composite	material	,	and	then	ways	to	 thermo 	 form 	 	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	combination	of	carbon	and	nylon	,	 in 	 to 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	complex	 shape 	 s 	 	you	want	,	like	the	one	just	 show 	 n 	 	at	the	auto	show	by	one	of	the	tier	-	one	 suppli 	 ers 	 	.
and	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	you	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	way	 get 	 s 	 	 radical 	 ly 	 	 simpl 	 ified 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	auto	body	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	say	,	14	 part 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	100	,	150	.
each	one	is	 form 	 ed 	 	by	one	 fair 	 ly 	 	cheap	die	set	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	four	expensive	 one 	 s 	 	for	 stamp 	 ing 	 	steel	.
each	of	the	 part 	 s 	 	can	be	 eas 	 ily 	 	 lift 	 ed 	 	with	no	 ho 	 ist 	 	.
they	snap	together	like	a	kid	's	 to 	 y 	 	.
so	you	got	rid	of	the	body	shop	.
and	if	you	want	,	you	can	lay	color	in	the	mold	,	and	get	rid	of	the	paint	shop	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	two	 hard 	 est 	 	and	 cost 	 liest 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	making	a	car	.
so	you	end	up	with	at	 l 	 east 	 	two	-	fifths	lower	capital	 intens 	 ity 	 	than	the	 lean 	 est 	 	plant	in	the	industry	,	which	gm	 ha 	 s 	 	in	lansing	.
the	plant	 al 	 so 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 small 	 er 	 	.
now	,	when	you	go	through	a	similar	analysis	for	every	way	we	use	oil	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	industry	,	 feed 	 stock 	 s 	 	and	so	on	,	you	find	that	of	the	28	million	 barrel 	 s 	 	a	day	the	government	 say 	 s 	 	we	will	need	in	2025	,	well	,	about	eight	of	that	can	be	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	by	efficiency	by	then	,	with	 an 	 other 	 	seven	still	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	vehicle	 stock 	 s 	 	turn	over	,	at	an	average	cost	of	 on 	 ly 	 	12	 buck 	 s 	 	a	barrel	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	26	for	 buy 	 ing 	 	the	oil	.
and	then	 an 	 other 	 	six	can	be	made	 ro 	 bust 	 ly 	 	,	 competitive 	 ly 	 	,	from	 cell 	 ulosic 	 	ethanol	and	a	little	bio	-	 dies 	 el 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 inter 	 fer 	 ing 	 	at	all	with	the	water	or	land	 need 	 s 	 	of	crop	production	.
there	is	a	huge	amount	of	gas	to	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	,	about	half	the	 project 	 ed 	 	gas	at	about	an	eighth	of	 it 	 s 	 	price	.
and	here	are	some	no	-	 brain 	 er 	 	 substitut 	 ions 	 	of	it	,	with	 lot 	 s 	 	left	over	.
so	much	,	in	fact	,	that	after	you	've	 handle 	 d 	 	the	domestic	oil	 fore 	 cast 	 	from	 area 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	approved	,	you	have	 on 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	bit	left	,	and	let	's	see	how	we	can	meet	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	menu	of	ways	.
we	could	,	of	course	,	buy	more	efficiency	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	ought	to	buy	efficiency	at	26	 buck 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	12	.
or	wait	to	capture	the	second	half	of	it	.
or	we	could	,	of	course	,	just	get	 th 	 is 	 	little	bit	by	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	import	some	canadian	and	mexican	oil	,	or	the	ethanol	the	brazilians	would	love	to	sell	us	.
but	they	'll	sell	it	to	japan	and	 chin 	 a 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 ta 	 riff 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	to	protect	our	corn	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	and	they	do	n't	.
or	we	could	use	the	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	gas	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	cover	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	balance	,	or	if	we	used	it	 a 	 s 	 	hydrogen	,	which	is	more	 profit 	 able 	 	and	efficient	,	we	'd	get	rid	of	the	domestic	oil	too	.
and	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	count	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	that	 avail 	 able 	 	land	in	the	dakotas	can	cost	 effective 	 ly 	 	make	 en 	 ough 	 	wind	power	to	run	every	 high 	 way 	 	vehicle	in	the	country	.
so	we	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 option 	 s 	 	.
and	the	choice	of	menu	and	 tim 	 ing 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	.
now	,	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	happen	 quick 	 er 	 	and	with	 high 	 er 	 	confidence	,	there	is	a	few	ways	government	could	help	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	fee	-	bates	,	a	combination	of	a	fee	and	a	 re 	 b 	 ate 	 	in	any	 s 	 ize 	 	class	of	vehicle	you	want	,	can	 in 	 crease 	 	the	price	of	 in 	 efficient 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	and	 correspond 	 ing 	 ly 	 	pay	you	a	 re 	 b 	 ate 	 	for	efficient	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
you	're	not	paid	to	change	 s 	 ize 	 	class	.
you	are	paid	to	pick	efficiency	 with 	 in 	 	a	 s 	 ize 	 	class	,	in	a	way	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	looking	at	all	 four 	 teen 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	life	-	cycle	fuel	 saving 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	the	first	two	or	three	.
 th 	 is 	 	 expand 	 s 	 	choice	 rapid 	 ly 	 	in	the	market	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	more	money	for	 auto 	 makers 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	'd	like	to	deal	with	the	lack	of	 afford 	 able 	 	personal	 mobil 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	by	making	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 cheap 	 ly 	 	possible	for	low	-	income	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	to	get	efficient	,	 reli 	 able 	 	,	 warrant 	 ed 	 	new	 car 	 s 	 	that	they	could	 other 	 wise 	 	never	get	.
and	for	each	car	so	 finance 	 d 	 	,	scrap	 al 	 most 	 	one	 clunk 	 er 	 	,	 prefer 	 ably 	 	the	 dirt 	 iest 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 create 	 s 	 	a	new	million	-	car	-	a	-	year	market	for	detroit	from	 custom 	 ers 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	get	 other 	 wise 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 credit 	 worthy 	 	and	could	never	afford	a	new	car	.
and	detroit	will	make	money	on	every	unit	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	if	,	say	,	african	-	american	and	white	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	had	the	same	car	 owner 	 ship 	 	,	it	would	cut	 employ 	 ment 	 	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	about	in	half	by	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	better	access	to	job	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	huge	social	win	,	too	.
 government 	 s 	 	buy	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 car 	 s 	 	a	year	.
there	are	smart	ways	to	buy	them	and	to	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	that	 pur 	 chasing 	 	power	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	 vehicle 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	market	 fast 	 er 	 	.
and	we	could	even	do	an	x	prize	-	style	 gold 	 en 	 	carrot	that	's	worth	 stretch 	 ing 	 	further	for	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	billion	-	dollar	prize	for	the	first	u.s.	 auto 	 maker 	 	to	sell	200,000	 re 	 ally 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	,	like	some	you	saw	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
then	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	 air 	 lines 	 	ca	n't	afford	to	buy	the	efficient	new	 plane 	 s 	 	they	 desperate 	 ly 	 	need	to	cut	 the 	 ir 	 	fuel	 bill 	 s 	 	,	but	if	you	felt	 philosoph 	 ically 	 	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	about	that	,	there	are	ways	to	finance	it	.
and	at	the	same	time	to	scrap	 in 	 efficient 	 	old	 plane 	 s 	 	,	so	that	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	to	come	back	in	the	air	,	they	would	waste	more	oil	,	and	block	the	 up 	 take 	 	of	efficient	,	new	 plane 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	part	 in 	 efficient 	 	 plane 	 s 	 	are	worth	more	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	dead	than	 al 	 ive 	 	.
we	ought	to	take	them	out	back	and	shoot	them	,	and	put	bounty	 hunter 	 s 	 	after	them	.
then	there	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	role	.
that	in	creating	the	move	to	high	-	volume	,	low	-	cost	commercial	production	of	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 material 	 s 	 	,	or	for	that	matter	,	ultra	-	light	 steel 	 s 	 	that	are	a	good	 back 	 up 	 	technology	,	the	 militar 	 y 	 	can	do	the	trick	it	did	in	 turn 	 ing 	 	darpanet	 in 	 to 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
just	turn	it	over	to	the	private	sector	,	and	we	have	an	 inter 	 net 	 	.
the	same	for	gps	.
the	same	for	the	modern	semi	-	conductor	industry	.
that	is	,	 militar 	 y 	 	science	and	technology	that	they	need	can	create	the	 advance 	 d 	 	 material 	 s 	 	-	industrial	cluster	that	 transform 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 civil 	 ian 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	 get 	 s 	 	the	country	off	oil	,	which	would	be	a	huge	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	 elimi 	 nating 	 	conflict	over	oil	and	 advanc 	 ing 	 	national	and	global	security	.
then	we	need	to	 re 	 tool 	 	the	car	industry	and	do	 re 	 training 	 	,	and	shift	the	 converg 	 ence 	 	of	the	energy	and	ag	-	value	 chain 	 s 	 	to	shift	 fast 	 er 	 	from	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	to	 carbohydrate 	 s 	 	,	and	get	out	of	our	own	way	in	other	ways	.
and	make	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	to	more	efficient	 vehicle 	 s 	 	go	 fast 	 er 	 	.
but	here	's	how	the	whole	thing	 fit 	 s 	 	together	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	official	 fore 	 cast 	 s 	 	of	oil	use	and	oil	 import 	 s 	 	going	 fore 	 ver 	 	up	,	they	can	turn	down	with	the	12	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	barrel	efficiency	,	down	 steep 	 ly 	 	by	 add 	 ing 	 	the	supply	-	side	 substitut 	 ions 	 	at	18	 buck 	 s 	 	,	all	 implement 	 ed 	 	at	 s 	 lower 	 	rates	than	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	before	when	we	paid	attention	.
and	if	we	start	 add 	 ing 	 	 tran 	 ches 	 	of	hydrogen	in	there	,	we	are	 rapid 	 ly 	 	off	 import 	 s 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	off	oil	in	the	2040s	.
and	the	one	thing	i	'd	like	to	point	out	here	is	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	eight	-	year	period	,	1977	to	85	,	when	we	last	paid	attention	,	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	grew	27	percent	,	oil	use	fell	17	percent	,	oil	 import 	 s 	 	fell	50	percent	,	oil	 import 	 s 	 	from	the	persian	 gu 	 lf 	 	fell	87	percent	.
they	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	gone	if	we	'd	 ke 	 pt 	 	that	up	one	more	year	.
well	,	that	was	with	 ver 	 y 	 	old	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 deliver 	 y 	 	 method 	 s 	 	.
we	could	 re 	 run 	 	that	play	a	lot	better	now	.
and	yet	what	we	 prov 	 ed 	 	then	is	the	u.s.	 ha 	 s 	 	more	market	power	than	opec	.
 our 	 s 	 	is	on	the	demand	side	.
we	are	the	saudi	arabia	of	``	nega	-	 barrel 	 s 	 	.	``
we	can	use	less	oil	 fast 	 er 	 	than	they	can	 convenient 	 ly 	 	sell	less	oil	.
 what 	 ever 	 	your	reason	for	 want 	 ing 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	national	security	or	price	 volatil 	 ity 	 	--	--	or	 job 	 s 	 	,	or	the	planet	,	or	your	grand	-	 kid 	 s 	 	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	oil	 end 	 game 	 	that	we	should	all	be	 play 	 ing 	 	to	win	.
