i	thought	i	would	think	about	changing	your	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	the	world	a	bit	,	and	 show 	 ing 	 	you	some	of	the	 design 	 s 	 	that	we	have	in	nature	.
and	so	,	i	have	my	first	slide	to	talk	about	the	 dawn 	 ing 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	what	i	call	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	scene	investigation	,	that	is	,	looking	at	the	 re 	 lic 	 s 	 	of	creation	and	 infer 	 ring 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	then	 follow 	 ing 	 	it	up	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	it	.
and	so	one	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	is	,	when	you	look	around	,	what	do	you	see	?
well	,	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	space	that	's	 create 	 d 	 	by	 design 	 ers 	 	and	by	the	work	of	people	,	but	what	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	is	a	lot	of	material	that	was	 al 	 ready 	 	here	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 shaped 	 	in	a	certain	form	.
and	so	the	question	is	:	how	did	that	material	get	here	?
how	did	it	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	form	that	it	had	before	it	got	 re 	 shaped 	 	,	and	so	forth	?
it	's	a	question	of	what	's	the	 continu 	 ity 	 	?
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	look	at	is	,	how	did	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	begin	and	shape	?
what	was	the	whole	process	in	the	creation	and	the	evolution	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	to	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	point	that	we	have	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 material 	 s 	 	?
so	that	's	sort	of	the	part	,	and	let	me	move	on	then	and	show	you	the	hubble	ultra	deep	field	.
if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	what	you	will	see	is	a	lot	of	dark	with	some	light	 object 	 s 	 	in	it	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	but	--	four	of	these	light	 object 	 s 	 	are	 star 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	see	them	there	--	little	 plus 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	star	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	star	,	 every 	 thing 	 	else	is	a	 galax 	 y 	 	,	ok	?
so	there	's	a	couple	of	thousand	 galax 	 ies 	 	you	can	see	 eas 	 ily 	 	with	your	eye	in	here	.
and	when	i	look	out	at	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 galax 	 y 	 	,	which	 look 	 s 	 	a	lot	like	 our 	 s 	 	,	i	wonder	if	there	's	an	art	design	college	 con 	 ference 	 	going	on	,	and	intelligent	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	there	are	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	you	know	,	what	 design 	 s 	 	they	might	do	,	and	there	might	be	a	few	 cosmo 	 logists 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	where	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 it 	 self 	 	came	from	,	and	there	might	even	be	some	in	that	 galax 	 y 	 	looking	at	 our 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	's	going	on	over	here	.
but	there	's	a	lot	of	other	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	and	some	are	 near 	 by 	 	,	and	they	're	kind	of	the	color	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	and	some	are	further	away	and	they	're	a	little	 blue 	 r 	 	,	and	so	forth	.
but	one	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	is	--	 th 	 is 	 	should	be	,	to	you	--	how	come	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clean	fraction	of	the	sky	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	1,000	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
we	think	there	's	on	the	order	--	visible	to	the	hubble	space	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	if	you	had	the	time	to	 s 	 can 	 	it	around	--	about	100	billion	 galax 	 ies 	 	.	right	?
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	number	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
and	that	's	 rough 	 ly 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	 star 	 s 	 	there	are	in	our	own	 galax 	 y 	 	.
but	when	you	look	at	some	of	these	 region 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	'll	see	more	 galax 	 ies 	 	than	 star 	 s 	 	,	which	is	kind	of	a	 con 	 un 	 drum 	 	.
so	the	question	should	come	to	your	mind	is	,	what	kind	of	design	,	you	know	,	what	kind	of	creative	process	and	what	kind	of	design	 produce 	 d 	 	the	world	like	that	?
and	then	i	'm	going	to	show	you	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	lot	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
we	're	going	to	try	and	follow	it	up	.
we	have	a	tool	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 help 	 s 	 	us	out	in	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	that	's	the	fact	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	big	that	it	's	a	time	machine	,	in	a	certain	sense	.
we	draw	 th 	 is 	 	set	of	 nest 	 ed 	 	 sphere 	 s 	 	cut	away	so	you	see	it	.
put	the	earth	at	the	center	of	the	 nest 	 ed 	 	 sphere 	 s 	 	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	we	're	making	 observ 	 ations 	 	.
and	the	moon	is	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 second 	 s 	 	away	,	so	if	you	take	a	picture	of	the	moon	using	 ordin 	 ary 	 	light	,	it	's	the	moon	two	 second 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	who	 care 	 s 	 	.
two	 second 	 s 	 	is	like	the	present	.
the	 s 	 un 	 	is	eight	 minute 	 s 	 	ago	.	that	's	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	deal	,	right	,	 un 	 less 	 	there	's	solar	 flare 	 s 	 	coming	then	you	want	to	get	out	the	way	.
you	'd	like	to	have	a	little	advance	 war 	 ning 	 	.
but	you	get	out	to	jupiter	and	it	's	40	 minute 	 s 	 	away	.	it	's	a	problem	.
you	hear	about	mars	,	it	's	a	problem	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	to	mars	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	light	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	go	there	.
but	if	you	look	out	to	the	 near 	 est 	 	set	of	 star 	 s 	 	,	to	the	 near 	 est 	 	40	or	50	 star 	 s 	 	,	it	's	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	take	a	picture	of	what	's	going	on	,	it	's	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
but	you	go	and	look	to	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	,	it	's	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
if	you	look	at	andromeda	,	which	is	the	 near 	 est 	 	big	 galax 	 y 	 	,	and	it	's	two	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
if	you	took	a	picture	of	the	earth	two	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	'd	be	no	evidence	of	 human 	 s 	 	at	all	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	think	there	 we 	 re 	 	 human 	 s 	 	yet	.
i	mean	,	it	just	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	scale	.
with	the	hubble	space	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	we	're	looking	at	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	to	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	to	come	up	with	an	idea	of	how	to	look	even	further	--	there	's	some	 thing 	 s 	 	even	further	,	and	that	was	what	i	did	in	a	lot	of	my	work	,	was	to	develop	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	--	we	could	look	out	back	to	even	 ear 	 lier 	 	 epoch 	 s 	 	before	there	 we 	 re 	 	 star 	 s 	 	and	before	there	 we 	 re 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	back	to	when	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	hot	and	dense	and	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
and	so	that	's	the	sort	of	sequence	,	and	so	i	have	a	more	 art 	 istic 	 	impression	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	's	the	 galax 	 y 	 	in	the	middle	,	which	is	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	,	and	around	that	are	the	hubble	--	you	know	,	 near 	 by 	 	kind	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	and	there	's	a	sphere	that	 mark 	 s 	 	the	different	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 hind 	 	that	are	some	more	modern	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
you	see	the	whole	big	picture	?
the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	time	is	funny	--	it	's	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	right	?
and	then	there	's	a	part	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	we	ca	n't	see	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	dense	and	so	hot	,	light	ca	n't	 es 	 cape 	 	.
it	's	like	you	ca	n't	see	to	the	center	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	;	you	have	to	use	other	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	know	what	's	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
but	you	can	see	the	edge	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	and	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 get 	 s 	 	that	way	,	and	you	can	see	that	.
and	then	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	model	area	around	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	that	is	the	 radi 	 ation 	 	coming	from	the	big	bang	,	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	uniform	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 al 	 most 	 	a	perfect	sphere	,	but	there	are	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	which	we	show	here	in	great	 exagge 	 ration 	 	.
and	from	them	in	the	time	sequence	we	're	going	to	have	to	go	from	these	 tin 	 y 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	to	these	 ir 	 regular 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	and	first	 star 	 s 	 	to	these	more	 advance 	 d 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	the	solar	system	,	and	so	forth	.
so	it	's	a	big	design	job	,	but	we	'll	see	about	how	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	on	.
so	the	way	these	 measure 	 ments 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	set	of	 satellite 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	get	to	see	.
so	there	was	the	cobe	satellite	,	which	was	 launch 	 ed 	 	in	1989	,	and	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	these	 vari 	 ations 	 	.
and	then	in	2000	,	the	map	satellite	was	 launch 	 ed 	 	--	the	wmap	--	and	it	made	 some 	 what 	 	better	 picture 	 s 	 	.
and	 lat 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	cool	 steal 	 th 	 	version	,	the	one	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 beaut 	 iful 	 	design	 feature 	 s 	 	to	it	,	and	you	should	look	--	the	planck	satellite	will	be	 launch 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	will	make	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	 map 	 s 	 	.
and	that	will	be	the	sequence	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	what	we	saw	was	,	we	saw	these	 vari 	 ations 	 	,	and	then	they	told	us	the	 secret 	 s 	 	,	both	about	the	structure	of	space	-	time	,	and	about	the	 content 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	about	how	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	original	 motion 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	a	spectacular	picture	,	and	i	'll	come	back	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	where	we	're	going	to	have	some	 myster 	 ious 	 	process	that	 kick 	 s 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	off	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
and	we	go	through	a	period	of	 accele 	 rating 	 	expansion	,	and	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 expand 	 s 	 	and	 cool 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	the	point	where	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	then	to	the	dark	 age 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	first	 star 	 s 	 	turn	on	,	and	they	evolve	 in 	 to 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	and	then	 lat 	 er 	 	they	get	to	the	more	expansive	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
and	 some 	 where 	 	around	 th 	 is 	 	period	is	when	our	solar	system	 start 	 ed 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	 matur 	 ing 	 	up	to	the	present	time	.
and	there	's	some	spectacular	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 waste 	 basket 	 	part	,	that	's	to	represent	what	the	structure	of	space	-	time	 it 	 self 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	period	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	weird	model	,	right	?
what	kind	of	evidence	do	we	have	for	that	?
so	let	me	show	you	some	of	nature	's	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	are	the	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	think	of	space	-	time	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	real	 sub 	 stance 	 	of	space	,	and	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	and	the	 star 	 s 	 	just	like	the	foam	on	the	ocean	.
it	's	a	marker	of	where	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	are	and	 what 	 ever 	 	went	on	.
so	here	is	the	sloan	digital	sky	survey	 show 	 ing 	 	the	location	of	a	million	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
so	there	's	a	dot	on	here	for	every	 galax 	 y 	 	.
they	go	out	and	point	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	at	the	sky	,	take	a	picture	,	identify	what	are	 star 	 s 	 	and	throw	them	away	,	look	at	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	estimate	how	far	away	they	are	,	and	plot	them	up	.
and	just	put	 radi 	 ally 	 	they	're	going	out	that	way	.
and	you	see	these	 structure 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	thing	we	call	the	great	wall	,	but	there	are	 void 	 s 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	,	and	they	kind	of	 fad 	 e 	 	out	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	is	n't	sensitive	 en 	 ough 	 	to	do	it	.
now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	in	3d	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	you	take	 picture 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	earth	 rot 	 ates 	 	,	you	get	a	fan	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sky	.
there	are	some	 place 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	look	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	own	 galax 	 y 	 	,	or	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	no	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	do	it	.
so	the	next	picture	 show 	 s 	 	you	the	three	-	dimensional	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	 rot 	 ating 	 	around	.
do	you	see	the	fan	-	like	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	made	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sky	?
remember	,	every	spot	on	here	is	a	 galax 	 y 	 	,	and	you	see	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	you	know	,	sort	of	in	our	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	and	you	sort	of	see	the	structure	.
and	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	thing	we	call	the	great	wall	,	and	you	see	the	 complic 	 ated 	 	structure	,	and	you	see	these	 void 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 place 	 s 	 	where	there	are	no	 galax 	 ies 	 	and	there	are	 place 	 s 	 	where	there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	 c 	 lump 	 ed 	 	together	,	right	.
so	there	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	pattern	,	but	we	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	data	here	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	the	pattern	.
we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	a	million	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	right	?
so	we	're	 keep 	 ing 	 	,	like	,	a	million	 ball 	 s 	 	in	the	air	but	,	what	's	going	on	?
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	survey	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	two	-	degree	field	of	view	 galax 	 y 	 	 red 	 shift 	 	survey	.
now	we	're	going	to	fly	through	it	at	warp	a	million	.
and	every	time	there	's	a	 galax 	 y 	 	--	at	 it 	 s 	 	location	there	's	a	 galax 	 y 	 	--	and	if	we	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	 galax 	 y 	 	,	which	we	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	 red 	 shift 	 	 measure 	 ment 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	you	put	in	the	type	of	 galax 	 y 	 	and	the	color	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	real	 represent 	 ation 	 	.
and	when	you	're	in	the	middle	of	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	it	's	hard	to	see	the	pattern	;	it	's	like	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	middle	of	life	.
it	's	hard	to	see	the	pattern	in	the	middle	of	the	audience	,	it	's	hard	to	see	the	pattern	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	we	're	going	to	go	out	and	 s 	 wing 	 	around	and	look	back	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	you	'll	see	,	first	,	the	structure	of	the	survey	,	and	then	you	'll	start	 see 	 ing 	 	the	structure	of	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	that	we	see	out	there	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	can	see	the	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	great	wall	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	up	here	.
but	you	can	see	the	 void 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	the	 complic 	 ated 	 	structure	,	and	you	say	,	well	,	how	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
suppose	you	're	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 design 	 er 	 	.
how	are	you	going	to	put	 galax 	 ies 	 	out	there	in	a	pattern	like	that	?
it	's	not	just	 throw 	 ing 	 	them	out	at	random	.
there	's	a	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	process	going	on	here	.
how	are	you	going	to	end	up	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?
and	so	now	we	're	in	for	some	serious	play	.
that	is	,	we	have	to	 serious 	 ly 	 	play	god	,	not	just	change	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	make	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	right	.
so	if	that	's	your	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	how	are	you	going	to	do	that	?
what	's	the	kind	of	 techni 	 que 	 	?
what	's	the	kind	of	thing	you	're	going	to	do	?
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	-	scale	 simul 	 ation 	 	of	what	we	think	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	might	be	like	,	using	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	some	of	the	play	 principle 	 s 	 	and	some	of	the	design	 principle 	 s 	 	that	,	you	know	,	 human 	 s 	 	have	 labor 	 ed 	 	so	hard	to	pick	up	,	but	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	nature	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	do	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
and	that	is	,	you	start	out	with	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	and	some	simple	 rule 	 s 	 	,	but	you	have	to	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	to	make	it	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
and	then	you	put	in	some	 random 	 ness 	 	,	some	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	and	some	 random 	 ness 	 	,	and	 real 	 ize 	 	a	whole	bunch	of	different	 represent 	 ations 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	show	you	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	matter	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	 scale 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	zoom	in	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plot	of	what	it	is	.
and	we	had	to	add	one	more	thing	to	make	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	come	out	right	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	matter	.
that	is	matter	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	interact	with	light	the	typical	way	that	 ordin 	 ary 	 	matter	 do 	 es 	 	,	the	way	the	light	's	 shin 	 ing 	 	on	me	or	on	the	stage	.
it	's	 trans 	 parent 	 	to	light	,	but	in	order	for	you	to	see	it	,	we	're	going	to	make	it	white	.	ok	?
so	the	stuff	that	's	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	that	's	white	,	that	is	the	dark	matter	.
it	should	be	 call 	 ed 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	matter	,	but	the	dark	matter	we	've	made	visible	.
and	the	stuff	that	is	in	the	yellow	color	,	that	is	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	kind	of	matter	that	's	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 star 	 s 	 	and	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
so	i	'll	show	you	the	next	movie	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	--	we	're	going	to	zoom	in	.
notice	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	and	pay	attention	to	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	.
we	're	going	to	zoom	in	and	zoom	in	.
and	you	'll	see	there	are	all	these	 fi 	 lament 	 s 	 	and	 structure 	 s 	 	and	 void 	 s 	 	.
and	when	a	number	of	 fi 	 lament 	 s 	 	come	together	in	a	knot	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	a	 super 	 cluster 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	we	're	 zoom 	 ing 	 	in	on	is	 some 	 where 	 	between	100,000	and	a	million	 galax 	 ies 	 	in	that	small	region	.
so	we	live	in	the	 bo 	 onies 	 	.
we	do	n't	live	in	the	center	of	the	solar	system	,	we	do	n't	live	in	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	and	our	 galax 	 y 	 	's	not	in	the	center	of	the	cluster	.
so	we	're	 zoom 	 ing 	 	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	region	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	more	than	100,000	,	on	the	order	of	a	million	 galax 	 ies 	 	in	that	region	.
we	're	going	to	keep	 zoom 	 ing 	 	in	.	ok	.
and	so	i	 for 	 got 	 	to	tell	you	the	scale	.
a	 parse 	 c 	 	is	3.26	light	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	a	 giga 	 parse 	 c 	 	is	three	billion	light	 year 	 s 	 	--	that	's	the	scale	.
so	it	 take 	 s 	 	light	three	billion	 year 	 s 	 	to	travel	over	that	distance	.
now	we	're	 in 	 to 	 	a	distance	sort	of	between	here	and	here	.
that	's	the	distance	between	us	and	andromeda	,	right	?
these	little	 s 	 peck 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	in	here	,	they	're	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
now	we	're	going	to	zoom	back	out	,	and	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	structure	that	,	when	we	get	 ver 	 y 	 	far	out	,	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	regular	,	but	it	's	made	up	of	a	lot	of	 ir 	 regular 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	.
so	they	're	simple	building	 block 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	fluid	to	begin	with	.
it	's	got	dark	matter	,	it	's	got	 ordin 	 ary 	 	matter	,	it	's	got	 photo 	 ns 	 	and	it	's	got	 neutrino 	 s 	 	,	which	do	n't	play	much	role	in	the	 lat 	 er 	 	part	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	it	's	just	a	simple	fluid	and	it	,	over	time	,	 develop 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	structure	.
and	so	you	know	when	you	first	saw	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	it	did	n't	mean	 quit 	 e 	 	so	much	to	you	.
here	you	're	looking	 a 	 cross 	 	one	percent	of	the	volume	of	the	visible	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	right	,	and	 nod 	 es 	 	,	but	you	 real 	 ize 	 	they	're	not	even	the	main	structure	.
there	's	a	 frame 	 work 	 	,	which	is	the	dark	matter	,	the	 in 	 visible 	 	matter	,	that	's	out	there	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	all	together	.
so	let	's	fly	through	it	,	and	you	can	see	how	much	 hard 	 er 	 	it	is	when	you	're	in	the	middle	of	 some 	 thing 	 	to	figure	 th 	 is 	 	out	.
so	here	's	that	same	end	result	.
you	see	a	 fi 	 lament 	 	,	you	see	the	light	is	the	 in 	 visible 	 	matter	,	and	the	yellow	is	the	 star 	 s 	 	or	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	up	.
and	we	're	going	to	fly	around	,	and	we	'll	fly	around	,	and	you	'll	see	 occasion 	 ally 	 	a	couple	of	 fi 	 lament 	 s 	 	intersect	,	and	you	get	a	large	cluster	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
and	then	we	'll	fly	in	to	where	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	cluster	is	,	and	you	can	see	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
and	so	from	 in 	 side 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	right	?
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	when	you	look	at	it	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	scale	,	and	explore	it	and	so	forth	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 intric 	 ate 	 	,	 complic 	 ated 	 	kind	of	a	design	,	right	?
and	it	's	grown	up	in	some	kind	of	way	.
so	the	question	is	,	how	hard	would	it	be	to	assemble	 th 	 is 	 	,	right	?
how	big	a	 contract 	 or 	 	team	would	you	need	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	together	,	right	?
that	's	the	issue	,	right	?
and	so	here	we	are	.
you	see	how	the	 fi 	 lament 	 	--	you	see	how	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 fi 	 lament 	 s 	 	are	coming	together	,	 there 	 fore 	 	making	 th 	 is 	 	 super 	 cluster 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
and	you	have	to	understand	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	how	it	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	if	you	--	first	,	you	ca	n't	travel	 th 	 is 	 	fast	,	 every 	 thing 	 	would	be	 distort 	 ed 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	using	simple	 render 	 ing 	 	and	graphic	 art 	 s 	 	kind	of	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	,	if	you	took	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	to	go	around	,	it	might	look	to	you	,	right	?
and	if	you	could	see	 in 	 visible 	 	matter	,	too	.
and	so	the	idea	is	,	you	know	,	how	would	you	put	together	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	way	?
we	're	going	to	start	and	 real 	 ize 	 	that	the	entire	visible	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	we	can	see	in	every	direction	with	the	hubble	space	 tele 	 scope 	 	plus	our	other	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	was	once	in	a	region	that	was	 small 	 er 	 	than	an	atom	.
it	 start 	 ed 	 	with	 tin 	 y 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	,	but	 expand 	 ing 	 	at	a	tremendous	rate	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 stretch 	 ed 	 	to	astronomical	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	see	in	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 micro 	 wave 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	.
and	then	we	 need 	 ed 	 	some	way	to	turn	 t 	 hose 	 	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	and	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	and	make	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 structure 	 s 	 	go	on	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	 small 	 er 	 	 simul 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 simul 	 ation 	 	was	run	on	1,000	 processor 	 s 	 	for	a	month	in	order	to	make	just	 th 	 is 	 	simple	visible	one	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	one	that	can	be	run	on	a	 desk 	 top 	 	in	two	 day 	 s 	 	in	the	next	picture	.
so	you	start	out	with	 teen 	 y 	 	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	when	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	now	four	 time 	 s 	 	 small 	 er 	 	,	and	so	forth	.
and	you	start	 see 	 ing 	 	these	 network 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 cosm 	 ic 	 	web	of	structure	 form 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	simple	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	matter	and	it	just	 ha 	 s 	 	the	dark	matter	in	it	.
and	you	see	how	the	dark	matter	 lump 	 s 	 	up	,	and	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	matter	just	 trail 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	.
so	there	it	is	.
at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	uniform	.
the	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	are	a	part	in	100,000	.
there	are	a	few	 peak 	 s 	 	that	are	a	part	in	10,000	,	and	then	over	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 gravit 	 y 	 	just	 pull 	 s 	 	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	light	over	density	,	 pull 	 s 	 	the	material	around	in	.
that	 pull 	 s 	 	in	more	material	and	 pull 	 s 	 	in	more	material	.
but	the	 distance 	 s 	 	on	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	are	so	large	and	the	time	 scale 	 s 	 	are	so	large	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	long	time	for	 th 	 is 	 	to	form	.
and	it	 keep 	 s 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 rough 	 ly 	 	about	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	it	is	now	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	expansion	.
and	at	that	point	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 myster 	 iously 	 	 start 	 s 	 	 accele 	 rating 	 	 it 	 s 	 	expansion	and	 cut 	 s 	 	off	the	 form 	 ation 	 	of	 large 	 r 	 	-	scale	structure	.
so	we	're	just	 see 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	large	a	scale	structure	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	see	,	and	then	 on 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	 start 	 ed 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	are	going	to	form	,	and	then	from	then	on	it	's	going	to	go	on	.
so	we	're	able	to	do	the	 simul 	 ation 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	two	 day 	 s 	 	on	a	 desk 	 top 	 	.
we	need	,	you	know	,	30	 day 	 s 	 	on	1,000	 processor 	 s 	 	to	do	the	kind	of	 simul 	 ation 	 	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	.
so	we	have	an	idea	of	how	to	play	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	creating	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	by	 start 	 ing 	 	with	 essential 	 ly 	 	less	than	an	 eye 	 drop 	 	full	of	material	,	and	we	create	 every 	 thing 	 	we	can	see	in	any	direction	,	right	,	from	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	--	that	is	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	small	--	and	it	is	 al 	 most 	 	perfect	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	these	 tin 	 y 	 	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	at	a	part	in	100,000	level	,	which	turn	out	to	produce	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 s 	 	we	see	,	that	is	,	 galax 	 ies 	 	and	 star 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
so	we	have	a	model	,	and	we	can	 calcul 	 ate 	 	it	,	and	we	can	use	it	to	make	 design 	 s 	 	of	what	we	think	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
and	that	design	is	sort	of	way	beyond	what	our	original	 imagin 	 ation 	 	ever	was	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	with	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	 explore 	 r 	 	--	made	the	map	on	the	upper	right	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	us	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	large	-	scale	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	on	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	.	you	can	kind	of	see	that	.
since	then	we	've	had	wmap	,	which	just	 give 	 s 	 	us	 high 	 er 	 	angular	 re 	 solution 	 	.
we	see	the	same	large	-	scale	structure	,	but	we	see	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	small	-	scale	structure	.
and	on	the	bottom	right	is	if	the	satellite	had	 flip 	 ped 	 	 up 	 side 	 	down	and	 ma 	 pped 	 	the	earth	,	what	kind	of	a	map	we	would	have	got	of	the	earth	.
you	can	see	,	well	,	you	can	,	kind	of	pick	out	all	the	major	 continent 	 s 	 	,	but	that	's	about	it	.
but	what	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	when	we	get	to	planck	,	we	'll	have	 re 	 solution 	 	about	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	the	 re 	 solution 	 	you	see	of	the	earth	there	,	where	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	see	the	 complic 	 ated 	 	pattern	that	 exist 	 s 	 	on	the	earth	.
and	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	tell	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	sharp	 edge 	 s 	 	and	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	fit	together	,	there	are	some	non	-	linear	 process 	 es 	 	.
 geo 	 logy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	these	 effect 	 s 	 	,	which	is	moving	the	 plate 	 s 	 	around	and	so	forth	.
you	can	see	that	just	from	the	map	 al 	 one 	 	.
we	want	to	get	to	the	point	in	our	 map 	 s 	 	of	the	early	 uni 	 verse 	 	we	can	see	 whet 	 her 	 	there	are	any	non	-	linear	 effect 	 s 	 	that	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	move	,	to	modify	,	and	are	giving	us	a	hint	about	how	space	-	time	 it 	 self 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	where	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	that	's	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	you	a	flavor	of	.
give	you	a	different	view	about	what	the	design	and	what	 every 	 thing 	 	else	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
thank	you	.
