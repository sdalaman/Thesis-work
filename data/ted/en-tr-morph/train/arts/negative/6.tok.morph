at	the	break	,	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	people	about	my	 comment 	 s 	 	about	the	aging	debate	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	my	 on 	 ly 	 	comment	on	it	.
and	that	is	,	i	understand	that	 optimist 	 s 	 	 great 	 ly 	 	 out 	 live 	 	 pessim 	 ists 	 	.
what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	in	my	18	 minute 	 s 	 	is	how	we	're	about	to	 s 	 witch 	 	from	 read 	 ing 	 	the	genetic	code	to	the	first	 stage 	 s 	 	of	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	write	the	code	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 th 	 is 	 	month	when	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	the	first	sequence	of	a	free	-	living	organism	,	that	took	a	genome	project	from	13	 year 	 s 	 	down	to	four	 month 	 s 	 	.
we	can	now	do	that	same	genome	project	in	the	order	of	two	to	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	.
so	in	the	last	decade	,	a	large	number	of	 genome 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	:	most	human	 pathogen 	 s 	 	,	a	couple	of	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 mammal 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	human	genome	.
 genomic 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	stage	of	the	 think 	 ing 	 	from	a	little	over	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	was	,	by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	we	might	have	between	three	and	five	 genome 	 s 	 	 sequence 	 d 	 	;	it	's	on	the	order	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	.
we	just	got	a	grant	from	the	gordon	and	betty	moore	 found 	 ation 	 	to	sequence	130	 genome 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	side	project	from	 environment 	 al 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
so	the	rate	of	 read 	 ing 	 	the	genetic	code	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	we	look	,	what	's	out	there	,	we	've	 bare 	 ly 	 	 scratch 	 ed 	 	the	surface	on	what	is	 avail 	 able 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
most	people	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 in 	 visible 	 	,	but	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	make	up	about	a	half	of	the	earth	's	 bio 	 mass 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	all	 animal 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	make	up	about	one	one	-	 thousand 	 th 	 	of	all	the	 bio 	 mass 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	people	in	oxford	do	n't	do	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	but	if	you	ever	make	it	to	the	sea	,	and	you	swallow	a	 mouth 	 ful 	 	of	 sea 	 water 	 	,	keep	in	mind	that	each	 milli 	 liter 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	about	a	million	bacteria	and	on	the	order	of	10	million	viruses	.
less	than	5,000	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	species	have	 be 	 en 	 	 character 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	of	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	the	sorcerer	ii	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	,	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	great	 ocean 	 o 	 graphic 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ample 	 	the	ocean	every	200	 mile 	 s 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	in	bermuda	for	our	test	project	,	then	 move 	 d 	 	up	to	halifax	,	 work 	 ing 	 	down	the	u.s.	east	coast	,	the	caribbean	sea	,	the	panama	 can 	 al 	 	,	through	to	the	galapagos	,	then	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	and	we	're	in	the	process	now	of	 work 	 ing 	 	our	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	indian	ocean	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	duty	;	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	a	 s 	 ailing 	 	vessel	,	in	part	to	help	 excit 	 e 	 	young	people	about	going	 in 	 to 	 	science	.
the	 experiment 	 s 	 	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	simple	.
we	just	take	 sea 	 water 	 	and	we	filter	it	,	and	we	collect	different	 s 	 ize 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	on	different	 filter 	 s 	 	,	and	then	take	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	back	to	our	lab	in	rockville	,	where	we	can	sequence	a	hundred	million	 letter 	 s 	 	of	the	genetic	code	every	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.
and	with	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	've	made	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	it	was	thought	that	the	visual	 pigment 	 s 	 	that	are	in	our	 eye 	 s 	 	--	there	was	 on 	 ly 	 	one	or	two	 organism 	 s 	 	in	the	environment	that	had	these	same	 pigment 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	 al 	 most 	 	every	species	in	the	upper	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	ocean	in	warm	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	have	these	same	 photo 	 receptor 	 s 	 	,	and	use	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	source	of	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	and	communication	.
from	one	 s 	 ite 	 	,	from	one	barrel	of	 sea 	 water 	 	,	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	1.3	million	new	 gene 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	50,000	new	species	.
we	've	 extend 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	air	now	with	a	grant	from	the	sloan	 found 	 ation 	 	.
we	're	 measur 	 ing 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	viruses	and	bacteria	all	of	us	are	 breath 	 ing 	 	in	and	out	every	day	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	on	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	or	closed	 audit 	 orium 	 s 	 	.
we	filter	through	some	simple	 apparatus 	 es 	 	;	we	collect	on	the	order	of	a	billion	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	from	just	a	day	 filter 	 ing 	 	on	top	of	a	building	in	new	york	city	.
and	we	're	in	the	process	of	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	all	that	at	the	present	time	.
just	on	the	data	 collect 	 ion 	 	side	,	just	where	we	are	through	the	galapagos	,	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	that	 al 	 most 	 	every	200	 mile 	 s 	 	,	we	see	tremendous	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	the	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	.
some	of	these	make	logical	sense	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	different	temperature	 grad 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	satellite	photograph	based	on	 temperature 	 s 	 	--	red	 be 	 ing 	 	warm	,	blue	 be 	 ing 	 	cold	--	and	we	found	there	's	a	tremendous	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	warm	water	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	the	cold	water	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	abundant	species	.
the	other	thing	that	 surprise 	 d 	 	us	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	is	these	 photo 	 receptor 	 s 	 	detect	different	 wave 	 length 	 s 	 	of	light	,	and	we	can	predict	that	based	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 am 	 ino 	 	acid	sequence	.
and	these	vary	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	from	region	to	region	.
 may 	 be 	 	not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	deep	ocean	,	where	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	blue	,	the	 photo 	 receptor 	 s 	 	tend	to	see	blue	light	.
when	there	's	a	lot	of	 chloro 	 phyl 	 l 	 	around	,	they	see	a	lot	of	green	light	.
but	they	vary	even	more	,	possibly	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 infra 	 red 	 	and	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	in	the	 extrem 	 es 	 	.
just	to	try	and	get	an	 assess 	 ment 	 	of	what	our	gene	repertoire	was	,	we	 assemble 	 d 	 	all	the	data	--	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	all	of	 our 	 s 	 	thus	far	from	the	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	,	which	 represent 	 s 	 	more	than	half	of	all	the	gene	data	on	the	planet	--	and	it	 total 	 ed 	 	around	29	million	 gene 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	put	these	 in 	 to 	 	gene	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	to	see	what	these	 discover 	 ies 	 	are	:	are	we	just	 discover 	 ing 	 	new	 member 	 s 	 	of	known	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	or	are	we	 discover 	 ing 	 	new	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	?
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	have	about	50,000	major	gene	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	but	every	new	 s 	 ample 	 	we	take	in	the	environment	 add 	 s 	 	in	a	linear	fashion	to	these	new	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
so	we	're	at	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	 stage 	 s 	 	of	 discover 	 y 	 	about	 bas 	 ic 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	,	 component 	 s 	 	and	life	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
when	we	look	at	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	tree	,	we	're	up	on	the	upper	right	-	hand	corner	with	the	 animal 	 s 	 	.
of	 t 	 hose 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	29	million	 gene 	 s 	 	,	we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	around	24,000	in	our	genome	.
and	if	you	take	all	 animal 	 s 	 	together	,	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	share	less	than	30,000	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	 may 	 be 	 	a	dozen	or	more	thousand	different	gene	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
i	view	that	these	 gene 	 s 	 	are	now	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	design	 component 	 s 	 	of	evolution	.
and	we	think	in	a	gene	-	centric	view	--	 may 	 be 	 	going	back	to	richard	dawkins	'	 idea 	 s 	 	--	than	in	a	genome	-	centric	view	,	which	are	different	 construct 	 s 	 	of	these	gene	 component 	 s 	 	.
synthetic	dna	,	the	ability	to	synthesize	dna	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	at	sort	of	the	same	pace	that	dna	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	over	the	last	decade	or	two	,	and	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	rapid	and	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	.
our	first	thought	about	synthetic	 genomic 	 s 	 	came	when	we	 sequence 	 d 	 	the	second	genome	back	in	1995	,	and	that	from	 myco 	 plasma 	 	 genital 	 ium 	 	.
and	we	have	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	t	-	 shirt 	 s 	 	that	say	,	you	know	,	``	i	heart	my	 genital 	 ium 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	a	 micro 	 organism 	 	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	500	 gene 	 s 	 	.
haemophilus	had	1,800	 gene 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	,	if	one	species	 need 	 s 	 	800	,	 an 	 other 	 	500	,	is	there	a	 small 	 er 	 	set	of	 gene 	 s 	 	that	might	 com 	 prise 	 	a	minimal	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	?
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 trans 	 po 	 son 	 	 mut 	 a 	 genesis 	 	.
transposons	are	just	small	 piece 	 s 	 	of	dna	that	 random 	 ly 	 	insert	in	the	genetic	code	.
and	if	they	insert	in	the	middle	of	the	gene	,	they	disrupt	 it 	 s 	 	function	.
so	we	made	a	map	of	all	the	 gene 	 s 	 	that	could	take	 trans 	 po 	 son 	 	 insert 	 ions 	 	and	we	 call 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	``	non	-	essential	 gene 	 s 	 	.	``
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	environment	is	 ver 	 y 	 	critical	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	define	an	essential	or	non	-	essential	gene	based	on	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	in	the	environment	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	take	a	more	 direct 	 ly 	 	intellectual	approach	with	the	 genome 	 s 	 	of	13	related	 organism 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 compar 	 e 	 	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	to	see	what	they	had	in	common	.
and	we	got	these	 over 	 lap 	 ping 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.	and	we	found	 on 	 ly 	 	173	 gene 	 s 	 	common	to	all	13	 organism 	 s 	 	.
the	pool	 expand 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	if	we	 ignor 	 ed 	 	one	 intra 	 cellular 	 	 parasit 	 e 	 	;	it	 expand 	 ed 	 	even	more	when	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	core	 set 	 s 	 	of	 gene 	 s 	 	of	around	310	or	so	.
so	we	think	that	we	can	expand	or	contract	 genome 	 s 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	your	point	of	view	here	,	to	 may 	 be 	 	300	to	400	 gene 	 s 	 	from	the	minimal	of	500	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	prove	these	 idea 	 s 	 	was	to	construct	an	artificial	 chromosom 	 e 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	in	them	,	and	we	had	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	cassette	-	based	fashion	.
we	found	that	 synth 	 es 	 izing 	 	accurate	dna	in	large	 piece 	 s 	 	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	difficult	.
ham	smith	and	clyde	hutchison	,	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	 develop 	 ed 	 	an	 excit 	 ing 	 	new	method	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	synthesize	a	5,000	-	base	pair	virus	in	 on 	 ly 	 	a	two	-	week	period	that	was	100	percent	accurate	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	sequence	and	 it 	 s 	 	biology	.
it	was	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	experiment	--	when	we	just	took	the	synthetic	piece	of	dna	,	 inject 	 ed 	 	it	in	the	bacteria	and	all	of	a	sudden	,	that	dna	 start 	 ed 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	production	of	the	virus	 particle 	 s 	 	that	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	and	then	 kill 	 ed 	 	the	bacteria	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	not	the	first	synthetic	virus	--	a	 poli 	 o 	 	virus	had	 be 	 en 	 	made	a	year	before	--	but	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	one	ten	-	 thousand 	 th 	 	 a 	 s 	 	active	and	it	took	three	 year 	 s 	 	to	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cartoon	of	the	structure	of	phi	x	174	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	case	where	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	now	 build 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	 hard 	 ware 	 	,	and	that	's	the	 not 	 ions 	 	that	we	have	with	biology	.
people	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	jump	to	 concern 	 s 	 	about	 bio 	 logical 	 	 war 	 fare 	 	,	and	i	had	 re 	 cent 	 	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	before	a	senate	 commit 	 tee 	 	,	and	a	special	 commit 	 tee 	 	the	u.s.	government	 ha 	 s 	 	set	up	to	review	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
and	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	keep	 re 	 ality 	 	in	mind	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	people	's	 imagin 	 ations 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	any	virus	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 sequence 	 d 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	that	genome	can	be	made	.
and	people	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	freak	out	about	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 eb 	 ola 	 	or	 small 	 pox 	 	,	but	the	dna	from	 th 	 is 	 	organism	is	not	 infect 	 ive 	 	.
so	even	if	 some 	 body 	 	made	the	 small 	 pox 	 	genome	,	that	dna	 it 	 self 	 	would	not	cause	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
the	real	concern	that	security	 depart 	 ments 	 	have	is	 design 	 er 	 	viruses	.
and	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	u.s.	and	the	 form 	 er 	 	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	,	that	had	major	 effort 	 s 	 	on	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	 bio 	 logical 	 	 war 	 fare 	 	 agent 	 s 	 	.
if	that	research	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 continu 	 ed 	 	,	there	should	be	 ver 	 y 	 	little	activity	on	the	know	-	how	to	make	 design 	 er 	 	viruses	in	the	future	.
i	think	single	-	cell	 organism 	 s 	 	are	possible	 with 	 in 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	possibly	 eukary 	 otic 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	that	we	have	,	are	possible	 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	.
so	we	're	now	making	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	dozen	different	 construct 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	vary	the	 cassette 	 s 	 	and	the	 gene 	 s 	 	that	go	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	artificial	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
the	key	is	,	how	do	you	put	all	of	the	 other 	 s 	 	?
we	start	with	these	 fragment 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	have	a	 homo 	 log 	 ous 	 	 re 	 combination 	 	system	that	 re 	 assemble 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	derived	from	an	organism	,	 de 	 ino 	 coccus 	 	 radio 	 dur 	 an 	 s 	 	,	that	can	take	three	million	 rad 	 s 	 	of	 radi 	 ation 	 	and	not	be	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
it	 re 	 assemble 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	genome	after	 th 	 is 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	burst	in	about	12	to	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	after	 it 	 s 	 	 chromosom 	 es 	 	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	blown	 a 	 part 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	organism	is	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	on	the	planet	,	and	 exist 	 s 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	now	in	 out 	 er 	 	space	due	to	all	our	travel	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	glass	 beak 	 er 	 	after	about	half	a	million	 rad 	 s 	 	of	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
the	glass	 start 	 ed 	 	to	burn	and	crack	,	while	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	bottom	just	got	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	and	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	.
here	's	an	actual	picture	of	what	 happen 	 s 	 	:	the	top	of	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	genome	after	1.7	million	 rad 	 s 	 	of	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
the	 chromosom 	 e 	 	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	blown	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	here	's	that	same	dna	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 re 	 assemble 	 d 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
it	's	 tru 	 ly 	 	 stunn 	 ing 	 	that	these	 organism 	 s 	 	can	do	that	,	and	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	if	not	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	of	different	species	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	that	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
after	these	 genome 	 s 	 	are	 synthesize 	 d 	 	,	the	first	step	is	just	 transplant 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	cell	 with 	 out 	 	a	genome	.
so	we	think	synthetic	 cell 	 s 	 	are	going	to	have	tremendous	potential	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	for	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	biology	but	for	 hope 	 fully 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	and	 socie 	 ty 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	from	the	third	organism	we	 sequence 	 d 	 	,	methanococcus	 jan 	 naschii 	 	--	it	 live 	 s 	 	in	 boil 	 ing 	 	water	 temperature 	 s 	 	;	 it 	 s 	 	energy	source	is	hydrogen	and	all	 it 	 s 	 	carbon	 come 	 s 	 	from	co	2	it	 capture 	 s 	 	back	from	the	environment	.
so	we	know	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 path 	 ways 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	different	 organism 	 s 	 	now	that	live	off	of	co	2	,	and	can	capture	that	back	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	using	carbon	from	oil	for	synthetic	 process 	 es 	 	,	we	have	the	chance	of	using	carbon	and	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	it	back	from	the	atmosphere	,	 convert 	 ing 	 	that	 in 	 to 	 	 bio 	 polymer 	 s 	 	or	other	 product 	 s 	 	.
we	have	one	organism	that	 live 	 s 	 	off	of	carbon	 mon 	 oxide 	 	,	and	we	use	 a 	 s 	 	a	 reduc 	 ing 	 	power	to	split	water	to	produce	hydrogen	and	oxygen	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	there	's	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	 path 	 ways 	 	that	can	be	engineered	 metabol 	 izing 	 	 m 	 ethane 	 	.
and	dupont	 ha 	 s 	 	a	major	program	with	statoil	in	norway	to	capture	and	convert	the	 m 	 ethane 	 	from	the	gas	 field 	 s 	 	there	 in 	 to 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
 with 	 in 	 	a	short	while	,	i	think	there	's	going	to	be	a	new	field	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 comb 	 inatorial 	 	 genomic 	 s 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	with	these	new	synthesis	 cap 	 abilities 	 	,	these	vast	gene	array	 repertoire 	 s 	 	and	the	 homo 	 log 	 ous 	 	 re 	 combination 	 	,	we	think	we	can	design	a	robot	to	make	 may 	 be 	 	a	million	different	 chromosom 	 es 	 	a	day	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	all	biology	,	you	get	 s 	 election 	 	through	 screen 	 ing 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	 screen 	 ing 	 	for	hydrogen	production	,	or	chemical	production	,	or	just	 vi 	 ability 	 	.
to	understand	the	role	of	these	 gene 	 s 	 	is	going	to	be	well	 with 	 in 	 	reach	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	modify	 photo 	 synthesis 	 	to	produce	hydrogen	 direct 	 ly 	 	from	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	.
 photo 	 synthesis 	 	is	 modul 	 ated 	 	by	oxygen	,	and	we	have	an	oxygen	-	 in 	 sensitive 	 	 hydrogen 	 ase 	 	that	we	think	will	 total 	 ly 	 	change	 th 	 is 	 	process	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	 cell 	 ula 	 s 	 es 	 	,	the	 enzyme 	 s 	 	that	break	down	complex	 sugar 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	simple	 sugar 	 s 	 	and	 ferment 	 ation 	 	in	the	same	cell	for	producing	ethanol	.
pharmaceutical	production	is	 al 	 ready 	 	under	way	in	major	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	using	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	.
the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	from	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	in	the	environment	is	 order 	 s 	 	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	more	complex	than	our	best	 chemist 	 s 	 	can	produce	.
i	think	future	engineered	species	could	be	the	source	of	food	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	a	source	of	energy	,	 environment 	 al 	 	 remedi 	 ation 	 	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 re 	 placing 	 	the	 petro 	 chemical 	 	industry	.
let	me	just	close	with	 ethic 	 al 	 	and	policy	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
we	 delay 	 ed 	 	the	start	of	our	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	1999	 un 	 til 	 	we	 complete 	 d 	 	a	year	-	and	-	a	-	half	 bio 	 ethic 	 al 	 	review	 a 	 s 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	we	should	try	and	make	an	artificial	species	.
every	major	 relig 	 ion 	 	 particip 	 ated 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	 stud 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	religious	 lead 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	using	 the 	 ir 	 	 script 	 ures 	 	 a 	 s 	 	law	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	they	could	n't	find	 any 	 thing 	 	in	them	 prohibit 	 ing 	 	making	life	,	so	it	must	be	ok	.	the	 on 	 ly 	 	ultimate	 concern 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 war 	 fare 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 g 	 ave 	 	us	the	go	 a 	 head 	 	to	start	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	for	the	 reason 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	them	.
right	now	the	sloan	 found 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	just	funded	a	multi	-	 institution 	 al 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	work	out	what	the	risk	and	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	are	,	and	the	 rule 	 s 	 	that	scientific	 team 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	my	own	should	be	using	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	,	and	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	set	good	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	forward	.
these	are	complex	 issue 	 s 	 	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	threat	of	bio	-	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 issue 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	,	can	we	design	 thing 	 s 	 	to	produce	clean	energy	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 revolution 	 izing 	 	what	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	can	do	and	provide	through	 vari 	 ous 	 	simple	 process 	 es 	 	.
