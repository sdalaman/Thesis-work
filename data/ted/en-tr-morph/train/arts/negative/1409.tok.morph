just	a	moment	ago	,	my	daughter	rebecca	 text 	 ed 	 	me	for	good	luck	.
her	text	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mom	,	you	will	rock	.	``
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	.
 get 	 ting 	 	that	text	was	like	 get 	 ting 	 	a	hug	.
and	so	there	you	have	it	.
i	 em 	 body 	 	the	central	paradox	.
i	'm	a	woman	who	 love 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 text 	 s 	 	who	's	going	to	tell	you	that	too	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	can	be	a	problem	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	that	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	of	my	daughter	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	my	story	.
1996	,	when	i	 g 	 ave 	 	my	first	tedtalk	,	rebecca	was	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	she	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	right	there	in	the	front	row	.
i	had	just	written	a	book	that	 celebr 	 ated 	 	our	life	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	i	was	about	to	be	on	the	cover	of	wired	magazine	.
in	 t 	 hose 	 	 head 	 y 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	chat	rooms	and	 on 	 line 	 	virtual	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	different	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	then	we	 un 	 plug 	 ged 	 	.
i	was	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	,	what	 excit 	 ed 	 	me	most	was	the	idea	that	we	would	use	what	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	the	virtual	world	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	about	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	to	live	better	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	real	world	.
now	fast	-	forward	to	2012	.
i	'm	back	here	on	the	ted	stage	 aga 	 in 	 	.
my	daughter	's	20.	she	's	a	college	student	.
she	 sleep 	 s 	 	with	her	 cell 	 phone 	 	,	so	do	i	.
and	i	've	just	written	a	new	book	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	time	it	's	not	one	that	will	get	me	on	the	cover	of	wired	magazine	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
i	'm	still	 excit 	 ed 	 	by	technology	,	but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	and	i	'm	here	to	make	the	case	,	that	we	're	 lett 	 ing 	 	it	take	us	 place 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	want	to	go	.
over	the	past	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 stud 	 ied 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	of	mobile	communication	and	i	've	 interview 	 ed 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	,	young	and	old	,	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 plug 	 ged 	 	in	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	've	found	is	that	our	little	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	in	our	 pocket 	 s 	 	,	are	so	 psycho 	 logically 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	that	they	do	n't	 on 	 ly 	 	change	what	we	do	,	they	change	who	we	are	.
some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	now	with	our	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	,	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	would	have	found	odd	or	 disturb 	 ing 	 	,	but	they	've	 quick 	 ly 	 	come	to	seem	familiar	,	just	how	we	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	just	to	take	some	quick	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	:	people	text	or	do	email	 dur 	 ing 	 	corporate	board	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
they	text	and	shop	and	go	on	facebook	 dur 	 ing 	 	 class 	 es 	 	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	 present 	 ations 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	all	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
people	talk	to	me	about	the	 import 	 ant 	 	new	skill	of	making	eye	contact	while	you	're	 text 	 ing 	 	.
people	explain	to	me	that	it	's	hard	,	but	that	it	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
 parent 	 s 	 	text	and	do	email	at	 break 	 fast 	 	and	at	 d 	 inner 	 	while	 the 	 ir 	 	children	complain	about	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	'	full	attention	.
but	then	these	same	children	 den 	 y 	 	each	other	 the 	 ir 	 	full	attention	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 cent 	 	shot	of	my	daughter	and	her	 friend 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	together	while	not	 be 	 ing 	 	together	.
and	we	even	text	at	 funeral 	 s 	 	.
i	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	 re 	 move 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	our	grief	or	from	our	 r 	 every 	 	and	we	go	 in 	 to 	 	our	 phone 	 s 	 	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	matter	?
it	 matter 	 s 	 	to	me	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	we	're	setting	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	for	trouble	--	trouble	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	how	we	 re 	 late 	 	to	each	other	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	trouble	in	how	we	 re 	 late 	 	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	our	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	self	-	 reflect 	 ion 	 	.
we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	used	to	a	new	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 al 	 one 	 	together	.
people	want	to	be	with	each	other	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 else 	 where 	 	--	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	all	the	different	 place 	 s 	 	they	want	to	be	.
people	want	to	 custom 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
they	want	to	go	in	and	out	of	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	they	are	 be 	 cause 	 	the	thing	that	 matter 	 s 	 	most	to	them	is	control	over	where	they	put	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	.
so	you	want	to	go	to	that	board	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	but	you	 on 	 ly 	 	want	to	pay	attention	to	the	bits	that	interest	you	.
and	some	people	think	that	's	a	good	thing	.
but	you	can	end	up	 hid 	 ing 	 	from	each	other	,	even	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	all	 constant 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	each	other	.
a	50	-	year	-	old	business	man	 lament 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	he	 feel 	 s 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	at	work	.
when	he	 go 	 es 	 	to	work	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	stop	by	to	talk	to	 any 	 body 	 	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	call	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	to	interrupt	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	they	're	too	 bus 	 y 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	email	.	``
but	then	he	 stop 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	'm	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	the	truth	.
i	'm	the	one	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	to	be	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	.
i	think	i	should	want	to	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	just	do	 thing 	 s 	 	on	my	 black 	 berry 	 	.	``
 a 	 cross 	 	the	 generation 	 s 	 	,	i	see	that	people	ca	n't	get	 en 	 ough 	 	of	each	other	,	if	and	 on 	 ly 	 	if	they	can	have	each	other	at	a	distance	,	in	 amount 	 s 	 	they	can	control	.
i	call	it	the	goldilocks	effect	:	not	too	close	,	not	too	far	,	just	right	.
but	what	might	feel	just	right	for	that	middle	-	aged	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	can	be	a	problem	for	an	adolescent	who	 need 	 s 	 	to	develop	face	-	to	-	face	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
an	18	-	year	-	old	boy	who	uses	 text 	 ing 	 	for	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	 wist 	 fully 	 	,	``	 some 	 day 	 	,	 some 	 day 	 	,	but	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	now	,	i	'd	like	to	learn	how	to	have	a	conversation	.	``
when	i	ask	people	``	what	's	wrong	with	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	?	``
people	say	,	``	i	'll	tell	you	what	's	wrong	with	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	place	in	real	time	and	you	ca	n't	control	what	you	're	going	to	say	.	``
so	that	's	the	bottom	line	.
 text 	 ing 	 	,	email	,	 post 	 ing 	 	,	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	let	us	present	the	self	 a 	 s 	 	we	want	to	be	.
we	get	to	edit	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	get	to	delete	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	get	to	 re 	 touch 	 	,	the	face	,	the	voice	,	the	 fl 	 esh 	 	,	the	body	--	not	too	little	,	not	too	much	,	just	right	.
human	 relationship 	 s 	 	are	rich	and	they	're	 mess 	 y 	 	and	they	're	 demand 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	clean	them	up	with	technology	.
and	when	we	do	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	happen	is	that	we	sacrifice	conversation	for	mere	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
we	short	-	change	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	over	time	,	we	seem	to	forget	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	we	seem	to	stop	 car 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	caught	off	guard	when	stephen	colbert	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	a	 pro 	 found 	 	question	,	a	 pro 	 found 	 	question	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	all	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 tweet 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	all	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 s 	 ip 	 s 	 	of	 on 	 line 	 	communication	,	add	up	to	one	big	gulp	of	real	conversation	?	``
my	answer	was	no	,	they	do	n't	add	up	.
 connect 	 ing 	 	in	 s 	 ip 	 s 	 	may	work	for	 gather 	 ing 	 	discreet	bits	of	information	,	they	may	work	for	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	about	you	,	``	or	even	for	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	love	you	,	``	--	i	mean	,	look	at	how	i	felt	when	i	got	that	text	from	my	daughter	--	but	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	work	for	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	each	other	,	for	 re 	 ally 	 	coming	to	know	and	understand	each	other	.
and	we	use	 conversation 	 s 	 	with	each	other	to	learn	how	to	have	 conversation 	 s 	 	with	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	a	flight	from	conversation	can	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	 be 	 cause 	 	it	can	 com 	 promise 	 	our	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	self	-	 reflect 	 ion 	 	.
for	 kid 	 s 	 	growing	up	,	that	skill	is	the	 bed 	 rock 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
over	and	over	i	hear	,	``	i	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	text	than	talk	.	``
and	what	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	is	that	people	get	so	used	to	 be 	 ing 	 	short	-	 change 	 d 	 	out	of	real	conversation	,	so	used	to	 get 	 ting 	 	by	with	less	,	that	they	've	 be 	 come 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 dispens 	 e 	 	with	people	 al 	 together 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	share	with	me	 th 	 is 	 	wish	,	that	some	day	a	more	 advance 	 d 	 	version	of	siri	,	the	digital	 assist 	 ant 	 	on	apple	's	iphone	,	will	be	more	like	a	best	friend	,	 some 	 one 	 	who	will	listen	when	 other 	 s 	 	wo	n't	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	wish	 reflect 	 s 	 	a	 pain 	 ful 	 	truth	that	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	no	one	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	me	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	our	 relationship 	 s 	 	with	technology	.
that	's	why	it	's	so	 appeal 	 ing 	 	to	have	a	facebook	page	or	a	twitter	feed	--	so	 man 	 y 	 	 autom 	 atic 	 	 listen 	 ers 	 	.
and	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	no	one	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	me	make	us	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	time	with	 machine 	 s 	 	that	seem	to	care	about	us	.
we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	,	they	call	them	 soci 	 able 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 specific 	 ally 	 	designed	to	be	 companion 	 s 	 	--	to	the	 elder 	 ly 	 	,	to	our	children	,	to	us	.
have	we	so	lost	confidence	that	we	will	be	there	for	each	other	?
 dur 	 ing 	 	my	research	i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	 nurs 	 ing 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 br 	 ought 	 	in	these	 soci 	 able 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	designed	to	give	the	 elder 	 ly 	 	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	.
and	one	day	i	came	in	and	a	woman	who	had	lost	a	child	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	a	robot	in	the	shape	of	a	baby	seal	.
it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	looking	in	her	 eye 	 s 	 	.
it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	conversation	.
it	 comfort 	 ed 	 	her	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	people	found	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
but	that	woman	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	sense	of	her	life	with	a	machine	that	had	no	experience	of	the	arc	of	a	human	life	.
that	robot	put	on	a	great	show	.
and	we	're	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
people	experience	pretend	 empath 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	the	real	thing	.
so	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	moment	when	that	woman	was	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	that	pretend	 empath 	 y 	 	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	that	robot	ca	n't	 empath 	 ize 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	face	death	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	life	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	that	woman	took	comfort	in	her	robot	companion	,	i	did	n't	find	it	 amaz 	 ing 	 	;	i	found	it	one	of	the	most	 wrench 	 ing 	 	,	 complic 	 ated 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	in	my	15	 year 	 s 	 	of	work	.
but	when	i	 steppe 	 d 	 	back	,	i	felt	 my 	 self 	 	at	the	cold	,	hard	center	of	a	perfect	storm	.
we	expect	more	from	technology	and	less	from	each	other	.
and	i	ask	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	why	have	 thing 	 s 	 	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	technology	 appeal 	 s 	 	to	us	most	where	we	are	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
and	we	are	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
we	're	 lone 	 ly 	 	,	but	we	're	 af 	 raid 	 	of	 in 	 timacy 	 	.
and	so	from	social	 network 	 s 	 	to	 soci 	 able 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	will	give	us	the	illusion	of	 companion 	 ship 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 demand 	 s 	 	of	 friend 	 ship 	 	.
we	turn	to	technology	to	help	us	feel	 connect 	 ed 	 	in	ways	we	can	 comfort 	 ably 	 	control	.
but	we	're	not	so	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
we	are	not	so	much	in	control	.
these	 day 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 phone 	 s 	 	in	our	 pocket 	 s 	 	are	changing	our	 mind 	 s 	 	and	 heart 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 off 	 er 	 	us	three	 grat 	 ifying 	 	 fanta 	 s 	 ies 	 	.
one	,	that	we	can	put	our	attention	 where 	 ver 	 	we	want	it	to	be	;	two	,	that	we	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	heard	;	and	three	,	that	we	will	never	have	to	be	 al 	 one 	 	.
and	that	third	idea	,	that	we	will	never	have	to	be	 al 	 one 	 	,	is	central	to	changing	our	 psych 	 es 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	moment	that	people	are	 al 	 one 	 	,	even	for	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 anx 	 ious 	 	,	they	panic	,	they	fidget	,	they	reach	for	a	 de 	 vice 	 	.
just	think	of	people	at	a	 check 	 out 	 	line	or	at	a	red	light	.
 be 	 ing 	 	 al 	 one 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	like	a	problem	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 solve 	 d 	 	.
and	so	people	try	to	solve	it	by	 connect 	 ing 	 	.
but	here	,	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	more	like	a	symptom	than	a	cure	.
it	 express 	 es 	 	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	solve	,	an	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	problem	.
but	more	than	a	symptom	,	constant	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	changing	the	way	people	think	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
it	's	 sha 	 ping 	 	a	new	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	.
the	best	way	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	is	,	i	share	 there 	 fore 	 	i	am	.
we	use	technology	to	define	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	by	sharing	our	 thought 	 s 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	even	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	them	.
so	before	it	was	:	i	have	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	i	want	to	make	a	call	.
now	it	's	:	i	want	to	have	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	i	need	to	 s 	 end 	 	a	text	.
the	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	new	regime	of	``	i	share	 there 	 fore 	 	i	am	``	is	that	,	if	we	do	n't	have	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	we	do	n't	feel	like	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	 al 	 most 	 	do	n't	feel	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	what	do	we	do	?	we	connect	more	and	more	.
but	in	the	process	,	we	set	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	to	be	 isolate 	 d 	 	.
how	do	you	get	from	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	 isol 	 ation 	 	?
you	end	up	 isolate 	 d 	 	if	you	do	n't	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	 s 	 ol 	 itude 	 	,	the	ability	to	be	 separat 	 e 	 	,	to	gather	 your 	 self 	 	.
 s 	 ol 	 itude 	 	is	where	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	so	that	you	can	reach	out	to	other	people	and	form	real	 attach 	 ments 	 	.
when	we	do	n't	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	 s 	 ol 	 itude 	 	,	we	turn	to	other	people	in	order	to	feel	less	 anx 	 ious 	 	or	in	order	to	feel	 al 	 ive 	 	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	we	're	not	able	to	appreciate	who	they	are	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	're	using	them	 a 	 s 	 	spare	 part 	 s 	 	to	support	our	fragile	sense	of	self	.
we	slip	 in 	 to 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	is	going	to	make	us	fell	less	 al 	 one 	 	.
but	we	're	at	risk	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	that	's	true	.
if	we	're	not	able	to	be	 al 	 one 	 	,	we	're	going	to	be	more	 lone 	 ly 	 	.
and	if	we	do	n't	teach	our	children	to	be	 al 	 one 	 	,	they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	know	how	to	be	 lone 	 ly 	 	.
when	i	spoke	at	ted	in	1996	,	 report 	 ing 	 	on	my	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	the	early	virtual	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 t 	 hose 	 	who	make	the	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	come	to	it	in	a	spirit	of	self	-	 reflect 	 ion 	 	.	``
and	that	's	what	i	'm	 call 	 ing 	 	for	here	,	now	:	 reflect 	 ion 	 	and	,	more	than	that	,	a	conversation	about	where	our	current	use	of	technology	may	be	taking	us	,	what	it	might	be	 cost 	 ing 	 	us	.
we	're	smitten	with	technology	.
and	we	're	 af 	 raid 	 	,	like	young	 lover 	 s 	 	,	that	too	much	 talk 	 ing 	 	might	spoil	the	 rom 	 ance 	 	.
but	it	's	time	to	talk	.
we	grew	up	with	digital	technology	and	so	we	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	all	grown	up	.
but	it	's	not	,	it	's	early	 day 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	time	for	us	to	 re 	 consider 	 	how	we	use	it	,	how	we	build	it	.
i	'm	not	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	we	turn	away	from	our	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	just	that	we	develop	a	more	self	-	aware	relationship	with	them	,	with	each	other	and	with	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	see	some	first	 step 	 s 	 	.
start	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 s 	 ol 	 itude 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	good	thing	.
make	room	for	it	.
find	ways	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	value	to	your	children	.
create	sacred	 space 	 s 	 	at	home	--	the	kitchen	,	the	 din 	 ing 	 	room	--	and	 re 	 claim 	 	them	for	conversation	.
do	the	same	thing	at	work	.
at	work	,	we	're	so	 bus 	 y 	 	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	that	we	often	do	n't	have	time	to	think	,	we	do	n't	have	time	to	talk	,	about	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
change	that	.
most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	we	all	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	listen	to	each	other	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	to	the	 bor 	 ing 	 	bits	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	when	we	 s 	 tumble 	 	or	 hesit 	 ate 	 	or	lose	our	 word 	 s 	 	that	we	reveal	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	each	other	.
technology	is	making	a	bid	to	 re 	 define 	 	human	 connect 	 ion 	 	--	how	we	care	for	each	other	,	how	we	care	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	giving	us	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	affirm	our	 value 	 s 	 	and	our	direction	.
i	'm	 optimist 	 ic 	 	.
we	have	 every 	 thing 	 	we	need	to	start	.
we	have	each	other	.
and	we	have	the	 great 	 est 	 	chance	of	success	if	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	our	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.
that	we	listen	when	technology	 say 	 s 	 	it	will	take	 some 	 thing 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	and	 promise 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 simpl 	 er 	 	.
so	in	my	work	,	i	hear	that	life	is	hard	,	 relationship 	 s 	 	are	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	risk	.
and	then	there	's	technology	--	 simpl 	 er 	 	,	 hope 	 ful 	 	,	 optimist 	 ic 	 	,	ever	-	young	.
it	's	like	 call 	 ing 	 	in	the	cavalry	.
an	ad	campaign	 promise 	 s 	 	that	 on 	 line 	 	and	with	 avatar 	 s 	 	,	you	can	``	 final 	 ly 	 	,	love	your	 friend 	 s 	 	love	your	body	,	love	your	life	,	 on 	 line 	 	and	with	 avatar 	 s 	 	.	``
we	're	drawn	to	virtual	 rom 	 ance 	 	,	to	computer	 game 	 s 	 	that	seem	like	 world 	 s 	 	,	to	the	idea	that	 robot 	 s 	 	,	 robot 	 s 	 	,	will	 some 	 day 	 	be	our	true	 companion 	 s 	 	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	an	 even 	 ing 	 	on	the	social	network	 in 	 stead 	 	of	going	to	the	pub	with	 friend 	 s 	 	.
but	our	 fanta 	 s 	 ies 	 	of	 substitut 	 ion 	 	have	cost	us	.
now	we	all	need	to	focus	on	the	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	ways	technology	can	lead	us	back	to	our	real	 live 	 s 	 	,	our	own	bodies	,	our	own	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	our	own	 politic 	 s 	 	,	our	own	planet	.
they	need	us	.
let	's	talk	about	how	we	can	use	digital	technology	,	the	technology	of	our	 dream 	 s 	 	,	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	life	the	life	we	can	love	.
thank	you	.
