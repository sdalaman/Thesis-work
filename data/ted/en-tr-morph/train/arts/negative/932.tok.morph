when	i	saw	a	piece	of	technology	 call 	 ed 	 	kinect	--	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	natal	--	i	was	inspired	,	and	i	thought	for	a	moment	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	possible	to	address	that	one	problem	of	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	to	create	a	character	which	 seem 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	,	which	 notice 	 d 	 	me	,	that	could	look	me	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	and	feel	real	,	and	sculpt	a	story	about	our	relationship	.
and	so	a	year	ago	,	i	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	off	at	a	computer	show	 call 	 ed 	 	e	3	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	piece	of	technology	with	 some 	 one 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	claire	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	boy	.
and	there	was	a	huge	row	 on 	 line 	 	about	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	ca	n't	be	real	.	``
and	so	i	 wait 	 ed 	 	till	now	to	have	an	actual	demo	of	the	real	tech	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	tech	 in 	 corporate 	 s 	 	three	big	 element 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	a	kinect	camera	,	which	will	be	out	in	november	,	some	 in 	 credible 	 	ai	that	was	 hid 	 den 	 	in	the	 dust 	 y 	 	 vault 	 s 	 	,	 collect 	 ing 	 	dust	in	 micro 	 soft 	 	,	plus	our	 quit 	 e 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	 attempt 	 s 	 	at	ai	at	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	lionhead	,	 mix 	 ing 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	just	to	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	one	simple	idea	:	to	create	a	real	,	living	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	computer	.
now	,	i	'll	be	honest	with	you	and	say	that	most	of	it	is	just	a	trick	,	but	it	's	a	trick	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	why	do	n't	we	go	over	and	have	a	look	at	the	demo	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	dimitri	.
dimitri	,	just	 wagg 	 le 	 	your	arm	around	.
now	,	you	notice	he	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	.
there	are	no	 controll 	 ers 	 	,	no	 key 	 board 	 s 	 	,	or	 mic 	 e 	 	,	or	 joy 	 stick 	 s 	 	,	or	 joy 	 pad 	 s 	 	.
he	is	just	going	to	use	his	hand	,	his	body	and	his	voice	,	just	like	 human 	 s 	 	interact	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	body	and	voice	.
so	let	's	move	forward	.
you	're	going	to	meet	milo	for	the	first	time	.
we	had	to	give	him	a	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	first	 create 	 d 	 	milo	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	he	came	 a 	 cross 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	of	a	 bra 	 t 	 	,	to	be	honest	with	you	.
he	was	 quit 	 e 	 	a	know	-	it	-	all	,	and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	kind	of	make	you	laugh	.
so	the	problem	we	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	him	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	he	's	just	 move 	 d 	 	house	.
he	's	 move 	 d 	 	from	london	to	new	england	,	over	in	america	.
his	 parent 	 s 	 	are	too	 bus 	 y 	 	to	listen	to	his	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	when	he	 start 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 con 	 jur 	 ing 	 	you	up	.
so	here	he	is	 walk 	 ing 	 	through	the	grass	.
and	you	're	able	to	interact	with	his	world	.
the	cool	thing	is	,	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	we	're	changing	the	mind	of	milo	 constant 	 ly 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	no	two	people	's	milos	can	be	the	same	.
you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 sculpt 	 ing 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	here	.
so	,	he	's	 discover 	 ing 	 	the	garden	.
you	're	 help 	 ing 	 	him	discover	the	garden	by	just	 point 	 ing 	 	out	these	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	simple	at	the	start	.
by	the	way	,	if	you	are	a	boy	,	it	's	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	;	if	you	're	a	girl	,	it	's	 butter 	 flies 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	found	was	that	 girl 	 s 	 	hate	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	.
so	remember	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	time	you	've	met	him	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	draw	you	in	and	make	you	more	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
his	face	,	by	the	way	,	is	fully	ai	-	driven	.
we	have	complete	control	over	his	blush	 respons 	 es 	 	,	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	of	his	 nostril 	 s 	 	to	 de 	 note 	 	stress	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	body	 match 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	're	 lean 	 ing 	 	forward	,	he	will	try	and	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	change	the	neuro	-	 linguist 	 ic 	 	nature	of	his	face	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	went	out	with	 th 	 is 	 	strong	idea	:	how	can	we	make	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	's	real	?
now	we	've	used	the	hand	.
the	other	thing	to	use	is	your	body	.
why	not	just	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 push 	 ing 	 	left	and	right	with	a	mouse	or	with	a	 joy 	 pad 	 	,	why	not	use	your	body	just	to	lean	on	the	chair	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 relax 	 ed 	 	?
you	can	lean	back	,	but	the	camera	will	change	 it 	 s 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	which	way	you	're	looking	.
so	dimitri	's	now	going	to	use	--	he	's	used	his	hand	;	he	's	used	his	body	.
he	's	now	going	to	use	the	other	thing	which	is	essential	,	and	that	's	his	voice	.
now	,	the	thing	about	voice	is	,	our	experience	with	voice	 re 	 cognition 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	awful	,	is	n't	it	?
it	never	 work 	 s 	 	.
you	order	an	 air 	 line 	 	ticket	;	you	end	up	in	timbuktu	.
so	we	've	 tackle 	 d 	 	that	problem	,	and	we	've	come	up	with	a	solution	,	which	we	'll	see	in	a	second	.
milo	:	i	could	just	squish	it	.
peter	molyneux	:	what	are	you	going	to	do	,	dimitri	?
female	voice	:	 squash 	 ing 	 	a	 s 	 nail 	 	may	not	seem	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	remember	,	even	 th 	 is 	 	choice	will	affect	how	milo	 develop 	 s 	 	.
do	you	want	milo	to	squash	it	?
when	you	see	the	 micro 	 phone 	 	,	say	...	...	 y 	 es 	 	to	decide	.
dimitri	:	go	on	,	milo	.	squash	it	.
pm	:	no	.	that	's	the	wrong	thing	to	do	.
now	look	at	his	 respons 	 e 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	go	on	,	milo	.	squash	it	.	``
what	we	're	using	there	is	,	we	're	using	 some 	 thing 	 	,	a	piece	of	technology	 call 	 ed 	 	tellme	.
it	's	a	company	that	 micro 	 soft 	 	 acquir 	 ed 	 	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	've	got	a	 data 	 base 	 	of	 word 	 s 	 	which	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	.
we	pick	 t 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	out	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 ference 	 	that	with	the	 ton 	 ation 	 	 data 	 base 	 	that	we	build	up	of	dimitri	's	voice	,	or	the	user	's	voice	.
now	we	need	to	have	a	bit	more	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	we	can	do	is	we	can	look	at	the	body	.
and	we	'll	do	that	in	a	second	.
milo	:	i	wonder	how	deep	it	is	.
deep	.
pm	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	what	we	're	going	to	do	now	is	teach	milo	to	skim	 stone 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	him	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	men	,	more	than	women	,	tend	to	be	more	competitive	here	.
they	're	fine	with	 teach 	 ing 	 	milo	for	the	first	few	 throw 	 s 	 	,	but	then	they	want	to	beat	milo	,	where	women	,	they	're	more	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 skimm 	 ing 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	.
how	do	you	skim	 stone 	 s 	 	?
you	stand	up	,	and	you	skim	the	stone	.
it	's	that	simple	.
just	 recogn 	 izing 	 	your	body	,	 recogn 	 izing 	 	the	body	's	 motion 	 s 	 	,	the	tech	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	you	've	gone	from	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	down	to	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	way	us	 human 	 s 	 	do	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	 cruci 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	if	we	want	milo	to	appear	real	.
female	voice	:	see	if	you	can	inspire	him	to	do	any	better	.
try	hitting	the	boat	.
milo	:	 a 	 hhh 	 	.	so	close	.
pm	:	that	's	dimitri	at	his	most	competitive	.
now	 beat 	 en 	 	an	11	-	year	-	old	child	.	well	 d 	 one 	 	.
milo	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
pm	:	so	,	milo	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	back	in	by	his	 parent 	 s 	 	,	giving	us	time	to	be	 al 	 one 	 	and	to	help	him	out	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	--	the	bit	that	we	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	at	the	start	--	his	 parent 	 s 	 	had	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	to	clean	up	his	room	.
and	we	're	going	to	help	him	with	 th 	 is 	 	now	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	an	 introduc 	 tion 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	about	the	deep	 psycho 	 logy 	 	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	use	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	is	the	most	 wonder 	 ful 	 	part	,	you	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	talk	in	your	natural	voice	to	milo	.
now	,	to	do	that	,	we	 need 	 ed 	 	a	set	up	,	like	a	 magic 	 ian 	 	's	trick	.
and	what	we	did	was	,	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	give	milo	 th 	 is 	 	big	problem	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	dimitri	 start 	 s 	 	 tidy 	 ing 	 	up	,	you	can	 over 	 hear 	 	a	conversation	that	milo	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	with	his	 parent 	 s 	 	.
milo	's	mom	:	oh	,	you	've	got	 gra 	 vy 	 	all	over	the	floor	.
milo	's	mom	:	that	carpet	is	brand	new	.
pm	:	so	he	's	just	 s 	 pill 	 ed 	 	a	plate	of	 sausage 	 s 	 	on	the	floor	,	on	the	brand	-	new	carpet	.
we	've	all	 d 	 one 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	;	we	've	all	 d 	 one 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	children	.
now	's	a	chance	for	dimitri	to	kind	of	 re 	 assure 	 	and	calm	milo	down	.
it	's	all	 be 	 en 	 	too	much	for	him	.
he	's	just	 move 	 d 	 	house	.	he	's	got	no	 friend 	 s 	 	.
now	is	the	time	when	we	open	that	 port 	 al 	 	and	allow	you	to	talk	to	milo	.
female	voice	:	why	do	n't	you	try	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 encourag 	 ing 	 	to	cheer	milo	up	.
dimitri	:	come	on	,	milo	.	you	know	what	 parent 	 s 	 	are	like	.
they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 stress 	 ed 	 	.
milo	:	what	do	they	want	to	come	here	for	 any 	 way 	 	?
we	do	n't	know	 any 	 one 	 	.
dimitri	:	well	,	you	've	got	a	new	school	to	go	to	.
you	're	going	to	meet	 load 	 s 	 	of	cool	,	new	 friend 	 s 	 	.
milo	:	i	just	 re 	 ally 	 	 mis 	 s 	 	my	old	house	,	that	's	all	.
dimitri	:	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	awesome	house	,	milo	.
you	've	got	a	cool	garden	to	play	in	and	a	pond	.
milo	:	it	was	good	 skimm 	 ing 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	nice	.
you	 clean 	 ed 	 	up	my	room	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
pm	:	so	after	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	an	hour	,	he	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	you	.
and	i	promise	you	,	if	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	 th 	 is 	 	screen	,	that	is	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	moment	.
and	we	're	ready	now	to	tell	a	story	about	his	 child 	 hood 	 	and	his	life	,	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 man 	 y 	 	 adventure 	 s 	 	.
some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 adventure 	 s 	 	are	a	little	bit	dark	or	on	the	 dark 	 er 	 	side	.
some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 adventure 	 s 	 	are	 wonder 	 fully 	 	 encourag 	 ing 	 	--	he	's	got	to	go	to	school	.
the	cool	thing	is	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	:	 a 	 s 	 	you	interact	with	him	,	you	're	able	to	put	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	world	;	he	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	 object 	 s 	 	.
his	mind	is	based	in	a	cloud	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	milo	's	mind	,	 a 	 s 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	use	it	,	will	get	 smart 	 er 	 	and	 clever 	 er 	 	.
he	'll	 recogn 	 ize 	 	more	 object 	 s 	 	and	thus	understand	more	 word 	 s 	 	.
but	for	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	where	technology	,	at	last	,	can	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	,	where	i	am	no	 long 	 er 	 	 re 	 s 	 trained 	 	by	the	finger	i	hold	in	my	hand	--	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	a	computer	game	's	 concern 	 ed 	 	--	or	by	the	 b 	 land 	 ness 	 	of	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	if	you	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	film	or	a	book	.
and	i	love	 t 	 hose 	 	 revolution 	 s 	 	,	and	i	love	the	future	that	milo	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
