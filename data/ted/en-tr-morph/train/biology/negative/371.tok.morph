 actual 	 ly 	 	,	for	the	next	18	 minute 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	do	the	best	i	can	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	particle	physics	 with 	 out 	 	 equ 	 ations 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	's	a	lot	we	can	learn	from	coral	.
coral	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	 un 	 usual 	 	animal	.
each	coral	head	 consist 	 s 	 	of	thousand	of	individual	 polyp 	 s 	 	.
these	 polyp 	 s 	 	are	 continu 	 ally 	 	 bud 	 d 	 ing 	 	and	 branch 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
if	we	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	a	hyper	-	intelligent	coral	,	we	can	single	out	an	individual	and	ask	him	a	 reason 	 able 	 	question	.
we	can	ask	how	 exact 	 ly 	 	he	got	to	be	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	location	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	his	 neighbor 	 s 	 	--	if	it	was	just	chance	,	or	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	or	what	?
now	,	after	 admonish 	 ing 	 	us	for	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	temperature	up	too	high	,	he	would	tell	us	that	our	question	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	stupid	.
these	 coral 	 s 	 	can	be	 quit 	 e 	 	kind	of	mean	,	you	see	,	and	i	have	surfing	 scar 	 s 	 	to	prove	that	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	polyp	would	 continu 	 e 	 	and	tell	us	that	his	 neighbor 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	copies	of	him	.
that	he	was	in	all	these	other	 location 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	but	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
for	a	coral	,	 branch 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	different	copies	is	the	most	natural	thing	in	the	world	.
 un 	 like 	 	us	,	a	hyper	-	intelligent	coral	would	be	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	prepared	to	understand	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	how	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	our	 re 	 ality 	 	is	 continu 	 ally 	 	 branch 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	different	 possibil 	 ities 	 	,	just	like	a	coral	.
it	's	a	weird	thing	for	us	 human 	 s 	 	to	wrap	our	 mind 	 s 	 	around	,	since	we	 on 	 ly 	 	ever	get	to	experience	one	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	 weird 	 ness 	 	was	first	 de 	 scribed 	 	by	erwin	schrödinger	and	his	cat	.
the	cat	 like 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	version	better	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 set 	 up 	 	,	schrödinger	is	in	a	box	with	a	 radio 	 active 	 	 s 	 ample 	 	that	,	by	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	 branch 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	state	in	which	it	is	 radiate 	 d 	 	and	a	state	in	which	it	is	not	.
in	the	branch	in	which	the	 s 	 ample 	 	 radiate 	 s 	 	,	it	 set 	 s 	 	off	a	trigger	that	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	poison	and	schrödinger	is	dead	.
but	in	the	other	branch	of	 re 	 ality 	 	,	he	 remain 	 s 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
these	 real 	 ities 	 	are	 experience 	 d 	 	 separat 	 e 	 ly 	 	by	each	individual	.
 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	either	can	tell	,	the	other	one	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	.
 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	weird	to	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	each	of	us	 on 	 ly 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	an	individual	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	and	we	do	n't	get	to	see	other	 branch 	 es 	 	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	each	of	us	,	like	schrödinger	here	,	are	a	kind	of	coral	 branch 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	different	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	world	 work 	 s 	 	at	 tin 	 y 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	.
it	can	be	 summ 	 ed 	 	up	in	a	single	sentence	:	 every 	 thing 	 	that	can	happen	,	 do 	 es 	 	.
that	's	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	mean	 every 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
the	rest	of	physics	is	about	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	what	can	happen	and	what	ca	n't	.
what	physics	 tell 	 s 	 	us	is	that	 every 	 thing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	 geo 	 metry 	 	and	the	 interact 	 ions 	 	of	 element 	 ary 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
and	 thing 	 s 	 	can	happen	 on 	 ly 	 	if	these	 interact 	 ions 	 	are	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 balanc 	 ed 	 	.
now	i	'll	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	 de 	 scribe 	 	how	we	know	about	these	 particle 	 s 	 	,	what	they	are	and	how	 th 	 is 	 	balance	 work 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	machine	,	a	beam	of	 proton 	 s 	 	and	anti	-	 proton 	 s 	 	are	 accele 	 rated 	 	to	near	the	speed	of	light	and	 br 	 ought 	 	together	in	a	collision	,	producing	a	burst	of	 pur 	 e 	 	energy	.
 th 	 is 	 	energy	is	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 convert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	spray	of	 sub 	 atomic 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	,	with	 detect 	 ors 	 	and	 computer 	 s 	 	used	to	figure	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	enormous	machine	--	the	large	hadron	collider	at	cern	in	geneva	--	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 circum 	 ference 	 	of	17	 mile 	 s 	 	and	,	when	it	's	 oper 	 ating 	 	,	 draw 	 s 	 	five	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	power	 a 	 s 	 	the	city	of	monterey	.
we	ca	n't	predict	 specific 	 ally 	 	what	 particle 	 s 	 	will	be	 produce 	 d 	 	in	any	individual	collision	.
 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	all	 possibil 	 ities 	 	are	 real 	 ized 	 	.
but	physics	 do 	 es 	 	tell	us	what	 particle 	 s 	 	can	be	 produce 	 d 	 	.
these	 particle 	 s 	 	must	have	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	mass	and	energy	 a 	 s 	 	is	carried	in	by	the	proton	and	anti	-	proton	.
any	 particle 	 s 	 	more	massive	than	 th 	 is 	 	energy	limit	are	n't	 produce 	 d 	 	,	and	remain	 in 	 visible 	 	to	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	 th 	 is 	 	new	particle	 accele 	 rator 	 	is	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	going	to	push	 th 	 is 	 	energy	limit	seven	 time 	 s 	 	beyond	what	's	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	before	,	so	we	're	going	to	get	to	see	some	new	 particle 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	.
but	before	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	what	we	might	see	,	let	me	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	 particle 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	of	.
there	's	a	whole	zoo	of	 sub 	 atomic 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
most	of	us	are	familiar	with	 electron 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	make	a	good	living	 push 	 ing 	 	them	around	.
but	the	electron	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	neutral	partner	 call 	 ed 	 	the	neutrino	,	with	no	electric	charge	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	mass	.
in	contrast	,	the	up	-	and	-	down	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	have	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 masse 	 s 	 	,	and	combine	in	 three 	 s 	 	to	make	the	 proton 	 s 	 	and	 neutron 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	.
all	of	these	matter	 particle 	 s 	 	come	in	left	-	and	right	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	 varie 	 ties 	 	,	and	have	anti	-	particle	 partner 	 s 	 	that	carry	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	.
these	familiar	 particle 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	less	familiar	second	and	third	 generation 	 s 	 	,	which	have	the	same	 charge 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	first	but	have	much	 high 	 er 	 	 masse 	 s 	 	.
these	matter	 particle 	 s 	 	all	interact	with	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	force	 particle 	 s 	 	.
the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	force	 interact 	 s 	 	with	 electric 	 ally 	 	charged	matter	via	 particle 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 photo 	 ns 	 	.
there	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	weak	force	 call 	 ed 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 imagin 	 ative 	 ly 	 	,	the	weak	force	,	that	 interact 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	with	left	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	matter	.
the	strong	force	 act 	 s 	 	between	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	which	carry	a	different	kind	of	charge	,	 call 	 ed 	 	color	charge	,	and	come	in	three	different	 varie 	 ties 	 	:	red	,	green	and	blue	.
you	can	blame	murray	gell	-	mann	for	these	 name 	 s 	 	--	they	're	his	fault	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	the	force	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	which	 interact 	 s 	 	with	matter	via	 it 	 s 	 	mass	and	spin	.
the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	understand	here	is	that	there	's	a	different	kind	of	charge	 associate 	 d 	 	with	each	of	these	 force 	 s 	 	.
these	four	different	 force 	 s 	 	interact	with	matter	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	 correspond 	 ing 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	that	each	particle	 ha 	 s 	 	.
a	particle	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	yet	,	but	we	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	,	is	the	higgs	particle	,	which	 give 	 s 	 	 masse 	 s 	 	to	all	these	other	 particle 	 s 	 	.
the	main	purpose	of	the	large	hadron	collider	is	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	higgs	particle	,	and	we	're	 al 	 most 	 	certain	it	will	.
but	the	 great 	 est 	 	 myster 	 y 	 	is	what	else	we	might	see	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	one	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
now	,	if	we	count	up	all	these	different	 particle 	 s 	 	using	 the 	 ir 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 spin 	 s 	 	and	 charge 	 s 	 	,	there	are	226	.
that	's	a	lot	of	 particle 	 s 	 	to	keep	track	of	.
and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	strange	that	nature	would	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	 element 	 ary 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
but	if	we	plot	them	out	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	,	some	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	emerge	.
the	most	familiar	charge	is	electric	charge	.
 electron 	 s 	 	have	an	electric	charge	,	a	negative	one	,	and	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	have	electric	 charge 	 s 	 	in	 third 	 s 	 	.
so	when	two	up	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	and	a	down	 quar 	 k 	 	are	 combine 	 d 	 	to	make	a	proton	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	total	electric	charge	of	plus	one	.
these	 particle 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	anti	-	 particle 	 s 	 	,	which	have	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	.
now	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	electric	charge	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	combination	of	two	other	 charge 	 s 	 	:	 hyper 	 charge 	 	and	weak	charge	.
if	we	spread	out	the	 hyper 	 charge 	 	and	weak	charge	and	plot	the	 charge 	 s 	 	of	 particle 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	two	-	dimensional	charge	space	,	the	electric	charge	is	where	these	 particle 	 s 	 	 s 	 it 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	direction	.
the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	and	weak	 force 	 s 	 	interact	with	matter	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 hyper 	 charge 	 	and	weak	charge	,	which	make	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 un 	 ified 	 	 electro 	 weak 	 	model	,	and	it	was	put	together	back	in	1967	.
the	reason	most	of	us	are	 on 	 ly 	 	familiar	with	electric	charge	and	not	both	of	these	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	higgs	particle	.
the	higgs	,	over	here	on	the	left	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	large	mass	and	 break 	 s 	 	the	symmetry	of	 th 	 is 	 	 electro 	 weak 	 	pattern	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	the	weak	force	 ver 	 y 	 	weak	by	giving	the	weak	 particle 	 s 	 	a	large	mass	.
since	 th 	 is 	 	massive	higgs	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	direction	in	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	the	 photo 	 ns 	 	of	 electro 	 magnet 	 ism 	 	remain	 mass 	 less 	 	and	interact	with	electric	charge	 a 	 long 	 	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	direction	in	 th 	 is 	 	charge	space	.
so	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	and	weak	 force 	 s 	 	are	 de 	 scribed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	of	particle	 charge 	 s 	 	in	two	-	dimensional	space	.
we	can	include	the	strong	force	by	 spread 	 ing 	 	out	 it 	 s 	 	two	charge	 direction 	 s 	 	and	 plot 	 ting 	 	the	 charge 	 s 	 	of	the	force	 particle 	 s 	 	in	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	these	 direction 	 s 	 	.
the	 charge 	 s 	 	of	all	known	 particle 	 s 	 	can	be	 plot 	 ted 	 	in	a	four	-	dimensional	charge	space	,	and	 project 	 ed 	 	down	to	two	 dimension 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	so	we	can	see	them	.
 when 	 ever 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	interact	,	nature	 keep 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	perfect	balance	 a 	 long 	 	all	four	of	these	charge	 direction 	 s 	 	.
if	a	particle	and	an	anti	-	particle	collide	,	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	burst	of	energy	and	a	total	charge	of	zero	in	all	four	charge	 direction 	 s 	 	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	 any 	 thing 	 	can	be	 create 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	energy	and	 maintain 	 s 	 	a	total	charge	of	zero	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	weak	force	particle	and	 it 	 s 	 	anti	-	particle	can	be	 create 	 d 	 	in	a	collision	.
in	further	 interact 	 ions 	 	,	the	 charge 	 s 	 	must	 al 	 ways 	 	balance	.
one	of	the	weak	 particle 	 s 	 	could	decay	 in 	 to 	 	an	electron	and	an	anti	-	neutrino	,	and	these	three	still	add	to	zero	total	charge	.
nature	 al 	 ways 	 	 keep 	 s 	 	a	perfect	balance	.
so	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 charge 	 s 	 	are	not	just	 pre 	 tty 	 	.
they	tell	us	what	 interact 	 ions 	 	are	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	happen	.
and	we	can	 rot 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	charge	space	in	four	 dimension 	 s 	 	to	get	a	better	look	at	the	strong	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	nice	 hexagon 	 al 	 	symmetry	.
in	a	strong	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	a	strong	force	particle	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 interact 	 s 	 	with	a	 color 	 ed 	 	 quar 	 k 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	green	one	,	to	give	a	 quar 	 k 	 	with	a	different	color	charge	--	 th 	 is 	 	red	one	.
and	strong	 interact 	 ions 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	each	second	in	every	atom	of	our	bodies	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	atomic	nuclei	together	.
but	these	four	 charge 	 s 	 	 correspond 	 ing 	 	to	three	 force 	 s 	 	are	not	the	end	of	the	story	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	include	two	more	 charge 	 s 	 	 correspond 	 ing 	 	to	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	force	.
when	we	include	these	,	each	matter	particle	 ha 	 s 	 	two	different	spin	 charge 	 s 	 	,	spin	-	up	and	spin	-	down	.
so	they	all	split	,	and	give	a	nice	pattern	in	six	-	dimensional	charge	space	.
we	can	 rot 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	in	six	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	and	see	that	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	.
right	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	 match 	 es 	 	our	best	current	knowledge	of	how	nature	is	built	at	the	 tin 	 y 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	of	these	 element 	 ary 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	know	for	certain	.
some	of	these	 particle 	 s 	 	are	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	limit	of	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	reach	with	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
from	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	,	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	the	particle	physics	of	these	 tin 	 y 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	.	the	way	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 work 	 s 	 	with	these	 tin 	 y 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
but	now	i	'm	going	to	discuss	some	new	and	old	 idea 	 s 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	know	yet	.
we	want	to	expand	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	using	 mathematic 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	and	see	if	we	can	get	our	 hand 	 s 	 	on	the	whole	enchilada	.
we	want	to	find	all	the	 particle 	 s 	 	and	 force 	 s 	 	that	make	a	complete	picture	of	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	we	want	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	picture	to	predict	new	 particle 	 s 	 	that	we	'll	see	when	 experiment 	 s 	 	reach	 high 	 er 	 	 energ 	 ies 	 	.
so	there	's	an	old	idea	in	particle	physics	that	 th 	 is 	 	known	pattern	of	 charge 	 s 	 	,	which	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	symmetric	,	could	emerge	from	a	more	perfect	pattern	that	 get 	 s 	 	broken	--	similar	to	how	the	higgs	particle	 break 	 s 	 	the	 electro 	 weak 	 	pattern	to	give	 electro 	 magnet 	 ism 	 	.
in	order	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	need	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	new	 force 	 s 	 	with	new	charge	 direction 	 s 	 	.
when	we	 introduc 	 e 	 	a	new	direction	,	we	get	to	guess	what	 charge 	 s 	 	the	 particle 	 s 	 	have	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	direction	,	and	then	we	can	 rot 	 ate 	 	it	in	with	the	 other 	 s 	 	.
if	we	guess	 wise 	 ly 	 	,	we	can	construct	the	standard	 charge 	 s 	 	in	six	charge	 dimension 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	broken	symmetry	of	 th 	 is 	 	more	perfect	pattern	in	seven	charge	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	choice	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	a	grand	 un 	 ified 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	by	pati	and	salam	in	1973	.
when	we	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	new	 un 	 ified 	 	pattern	,	we	can	see	a	couple	of	 gap 	 s 	 	where	 particle 	 s 	 	seem	to	be	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	 the 	 ories 	 	of	 un 	 ification 	 	work	.
a	physicist	 look 	 s 	 	for	 large 	 r 	 	,	more	symmetric	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	include	the	 establish 	 ed 	 	pattern	 a 	 s 	 	a	 sub 	 set 	 	.
the	 large 	 r 	 	pattern	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	predict	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	 particle 	 s 	 	that	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 ification 	 	model	 predict 	 s 	 	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	these	two	new	force	 particle 	 s 	 	,	which	should	act	a	lot	like	the	weak	force	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 weak 	 er 	 	.
now	we	can	 rot 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	set	of	 charge 	 s 	 	in	seven	 dimension 	 s 	 	and	consider	an	odd	fact	about	the	matter	 particle 	 s 	 	:	the	second	and	third	 generation 	 s 	 	of	matter	have	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 charge 	 s 	 	in	six	-	dimensional	charge	space	 a 	 s 	 	the	first	generation	.
these	 particle 	 s 	 	are	not	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	identified	by	 the 	 ir 	 	six	 charge 	 s 	 	.
they	 s 	 it 	 	on	top	of	one	 an 	 other 	 	in	the	standard	charge	space	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	if	we	work	in	eight	-	dimensional	charge	space	,	then	we	can	assign	 un 	 ique 	 	new	 charge 	 s 	 	to	each	particle	.
then	we	can	spin	these	in	eight	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	and	see	what	the	whole	pattern	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
here	we	can	see	the	second	and	third	 generation 	 s 	 	of	matter	now	related	to	the	first	generation	by	a	symmetry	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 trial 	 ity 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	pattern	of	 charge 	 s 	 	in	eight	 dimension 	 s 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	part	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 geo 	 metric 	 	structure	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	pattern	of	the	largest	 exception 	 al 	 	lie	group	,	e	8	.
 th 	 is 	 	lie	group	is	a	smooth	,	 curv 	 ed 	 	shape	with	248	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
each	point	in	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	a	symmetry	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	shape	.
one	small	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	e	8	shape	can	be	used	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	 curv 	 ed 	 	space	-	time	of	einstein	's	general	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	 explain 	 ing 	 	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
together	with	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	the	 geo 	 metry 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	shape	could	 de 	 scribe 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	about	how	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 work 	 s 	 	at	the	 tin 	 iest 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	.
the	pattern	of	 th 	 is 	 	shape	living	in	eight	-	dimensional	charge	space	is	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	and	it	 summarize 	 s 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	possible	 interact 	 ions 	 	between	these	 element 	 ary 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	,	each	of	which	is	just	a	facet	of	 th 	 is 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	shape	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	spin	it	,	we	can	see	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	other	 intric 	 ate 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	 contain 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
and	with	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 rot 	 ation 	 	,	we	can	look	down	through	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	in	eight	 dimension 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	a	symmetry	axis	and	see	all	the	 particle 	 s 	 	at	once	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	object	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	with	any	 un 	 ification 	 	,	we	can	see	some	 hole 	 s 	 	where	new	 particle 	 s 	 	are	 requir 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	.
there	are	20	 gap 	 s 	 	where	new	 particle 	 s 	 	should	be	,	two	of	which	have	 be 	 en 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	by	the	pati	-	salam	 particle 	 s 	 	.
from	 the 	 ir 	 	location	in	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	,	we	know	that	these	new	 particle 	 s 	 	should	be	 scal 	 ar 	 	 field 	 s 	 	like	the	higgs	particle	,	but	have	color	charge	and	interact	with	the	strong	force	.
 fill 	 ing 	 	in	these	new	 particle 	 s 	 	 complete 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	,	giving	us	the	full	e	8	.
 th 	 is 	 	e	8	pattern	 ha 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	deep	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 root 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 consider 	 ed 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	to	be	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	structure	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	fantastic	prospect	that	 th 	 is 	 	object	of	great	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	could	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	truth	of	particle	 interact 	 ions 	 	at	the	 small 	 est 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	 imagin 	 able 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	nature	is	 de 	 scribed 	 	by	 mathematic 	 s 	 	is	not	at	all	new	.
in	1623	,	galileo	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	nature	's	grand	book	,	which	 stand 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ally 	 	open	to	our	 gaz 	 e 	 	,	is	written	in	the	language	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
 it 	 s 	 	 character 	 s 	 	are	 triangle 	 s 	 	,	 circle 	 s 	 	and	other	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	which	it	is	 human 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	understand	a	single	word	of	it	;	 with 	 out 	 	these	,	one	is	 wander 	 ing 	 	around	in	a	dark	labyrinth	.	``
i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	true	,	and	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	follow	galileo	's	 gui 	 dance 	 	in	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	of	particle	physics	using	 on 	 ly 	 	 triangle 	 s 	 	,	 circle 	 s 	 	and	other	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	when	other	 physicist 	 s 	 	and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	can	resemble	a	dark	labyrinth	.
but	it	's	 re 	 assur 	 ing 	 	that	at	the	heart	of	 th 	 is 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	is	 pur 	 e 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 geo 	 metry 	 	.
 join 	 ed 	 	with	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	growing	e	8	coral	,	with	 particle 	 s 	 	 interact 	 ing 	 	at	every	location	in	all	possible	ways	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	pattern	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	more	of	the	pattern	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	view	using	new	 machine 	 s 	 	like	the	large	hadron	collider	,	we	may	be	able	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	nature	uses	 th 	 is 	 	e	8	pattern	or	a	different	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	process	of	 discover 	 y 	 	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	adventure	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	.
if	the	lhc	 find 	 s 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	that	fit	 th 	 is 	 	e	8	pattern	,	that	will	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	.
if	the	lhc	 find 	 s 	 	new	 particle 	 s 	 	,	but	they	do	n't	fit	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	--	well	,	that	will	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	bad	for	 th 	 is 	 	e	8	 theor 	 y 	 	.
and	,	of	course	,	bad	for	me	 personal 	 ly 	 	.
now	how	bad	would	that	be	?
well	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	bad	.
but	 predict 	 ing 	 	how	nature	 work 	 s 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 risk 	 y 	 	game	.
 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	like	it	are	long	 shot 	 s 	 	.
one	 do 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	hard	work	 know 	 ing 	 	that	most	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	wo	n't	end	up	 be 	 ing 	 	true	about	nature	.
that	's	what	 do 	 ing 	 	 theoretic 	 al 	 	physics	is	like	:	there	are	a	lot	of	 wipe 	 out 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	regard	,	new	physics	 the 	 ories 	 	are	a	lot	like	start	-	up	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	with	any	large	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	it	can	be	 emotion 	 ally 	 	difficult	to	abandon	a	line	of	research	when	it	is	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	out	.
but	in	science	,	if	 some 	 thing 	 	is	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	,	you	have	to	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	it	out	and	try	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.

chris	anderson	:	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	two	percent	of	that	,	but	i	still	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 love 	 d 	 	it	.	so	i	'm	going	to	sound	dumb	.
your	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	--	garrett	lisi	:	i	'm	used	to	coral	.
ca	:	that	's	right	.	the	reason	it	's	got	a	few	people	at	 l 	 east 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	're	right	,	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	 gravit 	 y 	 	and	 quant 	 um 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	together	.
so	are	you	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	should	think	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	at	 it 	 s 	 	heart	--	that	the	 small 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	there	are	,	are	 some 	 how 	 	an	e	8	object	of	 possibil 	 ity 	 	?
i	mean	,	is	there	a	scale	to	it	,	at	the	 small 	 est 	 	scale	,	or	.	.	.	?
gl	:	well	,	right	now	the	pattern	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	that	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	what	we	know	about	 element 	 ary 	 	particle	physics	--	that	 al 	 ready 	 	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	shape	.
and	that	's	the	one	that	i	 s 	 aid 	 	we	 k 	 new 	 	for	certain	.
and	that	shape	 ha 	 s 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 similar 	 ities 	 	--	and	the	way	it	 fit 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	e	8	pattern	could	be	the	rest	of	the	picture	.
and	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 point 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	for	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	represent	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	high	-	dimensional	object	that	would	be	 warp 	 ing 	 	and	moving	and	 danc 	 ing 	 	over	the	space	time	that	we	experience	.
and	that	would	be	what	 explain 	 s 	 	all	these	 element 	 ary 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	that	we	see	.
ca	:	but	a	string	 theor 	 ist 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	understand	it	,	 explain 	 s 	 	 electron 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	much	 small 	 er 	 	 string 	 s 	 	 vib 	 rating 	 	--	i	know	you	do	n't	like	string	 theor 	 y 	 	--	 vib 	 rating 	 	 in 	 side 	 	it	.
how	should	we	think	of	an	electron	in	relation	to	e	8	?
gl	:	no	,	it	would	be	one	of	the	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	e	8	shape	.
so	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	shape	is	moving	over	space	-	time	,	it	's	 twist 	 ing 	 	.	and	the	direction	it	's	 twist 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 move 	 s 	 	is	what	particle	we	see	.	so	it	would	be	--	ca	:	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	e	8	shape	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	that	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	electron	?
i	kind	of	feel	like	i	need	that	for	my	picture	.
is	it	 big 	 ger 	 	?	is	it	 small 	 er 	 	?
gl	:	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	 electron 	 s 	 	are	point	 particle 	 s 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	going	down	to	the	 small 	 est 	 	possible	 scale 	 s 	 	.
so	the	way	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 explain 	 ed 	 	in	 quant 	 um 	 	field	 theor 	 y 	 	is	,	all	 possibil 	 ities 	 	are	 expand 	 ing 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	at	once	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	i	use	the	 analog 	 y 	 	to	coral	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	the	way	that	e	8	 come 	 s 	 	in	is	it	will	be	 a 	 s 	 	a	shape	that	's	 attach 	 ed 	 	at	each	point	in	space	-	time	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	way	the	shape	 twist 	 s 	 	--	the	 direction 	 al 	 	 a 	 long 	 	which	way	the	shape	is	 twist 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 move 	 s 	 	over	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 ed 	 	surface	--	is	what	the	 element 	 ary 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	are	,	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	through	 quant 	 um 	 	field	 theor 	 y 	 	,	they	manifest	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 point 	 s 	 	and	interact	that	way	.
i	do	n't	know	if	i	'll	be	able	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	any	 clear 	 er 	 	.
ca	:	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
it	's	 evo 	 king 	 	a	kind	of	sense	of	wonder	,	and	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	want	to	understand	more	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	thank	you	so	much	for	coming	.	that	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
