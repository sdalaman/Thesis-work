it	's	a	simple	idea	about	nature	.
i	want	to	say	a	word	for	nature	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	 talk 	 ed 	 	that	much	about	it	the	last	couple	 day 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	say	a	word	for	the	 s 	 oil 	 	and	the	bees	and	the	 plant 	 s 	 	and	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	tell	you	about	a	tool	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	tool	that	i	have	found	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	a	 liter 	 ary 	 	 conce 	 it 	 	;	it	's	not	a	technology	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	for	,	i	think	,	changing	our	relationship	to	the	natural	world	and	to	the	other	species	on	whom	we	depend	.
and	that	tool	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	chris	 suggest 	 ed 	 	,	looking	at	us	and	the	world	from	the	 plant 	 s 	 	'	or	the	 animal 	 s 	 	'	point	of	view	.
it	's	not	my	idea	,	other	people	have	hit	on	it	,	but	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	take	it	to	some	new	 place 	 s 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	where	i	got	it	.
like	a	lot	of	my	 idea 	 s 	 	,	like	a	lot	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	i	use	,	i	found	it	in	the	garden	;	i	'm	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 devote 	 d 	 	 garden 	 er 	 	.
and	there	was	a	day	about	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	:	i	was	 plant 	 ing 	 	 potato 	 es 	 	,	it	was	the	first	week	of	may	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	new	england	,	when	the	apple	 tree 	 s 	 	are	just	 vib 	 rating 	 	with	bloom	;	they	're	just	white	 cloud 	 s 	 	above	.
i	was	here	,	 plant 	 ing 	 	my	 chunk 	 s 	 	,	cutting	up	 potato 	 es 	 	and	 plant 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	the	bees	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	tree	;	 bumble 	 bees 	 	,	just	making	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 vib 	 rate 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	about	 garden 	 ing 	 	is	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	all	your	 concent 	 ration 	 	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	get	hurt	--	it	's	not	like	 wood 	 work 	 ing 	 	--	and	you	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	kind	of	mental	space	for	 specul 	 ation 	 	.
and	the	question	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	that	afternoon	in	the	garden	,	 work 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	that	 bumble 	 bee 	 	,	was	:	what	did	i	and	that	 bumble 	 bee 	 	have	in	common	?
how	was	our	role	in	 th 	 is 	 	garden	similar	and	different	?
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	in	common	:	both	of	us	 we 	 re 	 	 dis 	 semi 	 nating 	 	the	 gene 	 s 	 	of	one	species	and	not	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	both	of	us	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	if	i	can	imagine	the	bee	's	point	of	view	--	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	the	 shot 	 s 	 	.
i	had	 decide 	 d 	 	what	kind	of	potato	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	plant	--	i	had	 pick 	 ed 	 	my	yukon	gold	or	yellow	finn	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	was	--	and	i	had	 summon 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	from	a	seed	catalog	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	,	 br 	 ought 	 	it	,	and	i	was	 plant 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	that	bee	,	no	doubt	,	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	it	had	 decide 	 d 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	for	that	apple	tree	,	i	'm	going	for	that	blossom	,	i	'm	going	to	get	the	nectar	and	i	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	.	``
we	have	a	 gram 	 mar 	 	that	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	's	who	we	are	;	that	we	are	sovereign	 subject 	 s 	 	in	nature	,	the	bee	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	me	.
i	plant	the	 potato 	 es 	 	,	i	weed	the	garden	,	i	 domestic 	 ate 	 	the	species	.
but	that	day	,	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	:	what	if	that	 gram 	 mar 	 	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	a	self	-	 serv 	 ing 	 	 conce 	 it 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	the	bee	 think 	 s 	 	he	's	in	charge	or	she	's	in	charge	,	but	we	know	better	.
we	know	that	what	's	going	on	between	the	bee	and	that	flower	is	that	bee	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 clever 	 ly 	 	 manipul 	 ated 	 	by	that	flower	.
and	when	i	say	 manipul 	 ated 	 	,	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	in	a	darwinian	sense	,	right	?
i	mean	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	set	of	 trait 	 s 	 	--	color	,	 s 	 cent 	 	,	flavor	,	pattern	--	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 lure 	 d 	 	that	bee	in	.
and	the	bee	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 clever 	 ly 	 	 fool 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	taking	the	nectar	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	some	powder	on	 it 	 s 	 	leg	,	and	going	off	to	the	next	blossom	.
the	bee	is	not	 call 	 ing 	 	the	 shot 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	then	,	i	was	n't	either	.
i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 seduce 	 d 	 	by	that	potato	and	not	 an 	 other 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 plant 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	--	 in 	 to 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	,	giving	it	a	little	bit	more	 habit 	 at 	 	.
and	that	's	when	i	got	the	idea	,	which	was	,	``	well	,	what	would	happen	if	we	kind	of	 look 	 ed 	 	at	us	from	 th 	 is 	 	point	of	view	of	these	other	species	who	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	us	?	``
and	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	to	me	not	 a 	 s 	 	an	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	technology	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	co	-	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	which	a	group	of	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	species	,	 most 	 ly 	 	 ed 	 ible 	 	 grass 	 es 	 	,	had	 exploit 	 ed 	 	us	,	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	get	us	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	 de 	 forest 	 	the	world	.
the	 com 	 petition 	 	of	 grass 	 es 	 	,	right	?
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	different	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 mow 	 ing 	 	the	lawn	that	day	was	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	experience	.
i	had	thought	 al 	 ways 	 	--	and	in	fact	,	had	written	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	first	book	;	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	book	about	 garden 	 ing 	 	--	that	 lawn 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	nature	under	culture	's	boot	,	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 total 	 itarian 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	and	that	when	we	 mow 	 ed 	 	them	we	 we 	 re 	 	 cruel 	 ly 	 	 suppress 	 ing 	 	the	species	and	never	 lett 	 ing 	 	it	set	seed	or	die	or	have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
and	that	's	what	the	lawn	was	.
but	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	``	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	 grass 	 es 	 	want	us	to	do	.
i	'm	a	 du 	 pe 	 	.	i	'm	a	 du 	 pe 	 	of	the	 lawn 	 s 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	goal	in	life	is	to	 out 	 compete 	 	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	who	they	compete	with	for	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	.	``
and	so	by	 get 	 ting 	 	us	to	mow	the	lawn	,	we	keep	the	 tree 	 s 	 	from	coming	back	,	which	in	new	england	 happen 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	 thing 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	and	wrote	a	whole	book	about	it	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 bot 	 any 	 	of	 desir 	 e 	 	.	``
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	in	the	same	way	you	can	look	at	a	flower	and	deduce	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	taste	and	the	 desir 	 es 	 	of	bees	--	that	they	like	 sweet 	 ness 	 	,	that	they	like	 th 	 is 	 	color	and	not	that	color	,	that	they	like	symmetry	--	what	could	we	find	out	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	?
that	a	certain	kind	of	potato	,	a	certain	kind	of	drug	,	a	sativa	-	indica	 can 	 nabis 	 	cross	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	say	about	us	.
and	that	,	would	n't	 th 	 is 	 	be	kind	of	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	way	to	look	at	the	world	?
now	,	the	test	of	any	idea	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	a	 liter 	 ary 	 	 conce 	 it 	 	--	is	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	get	us	?
and	when	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	nature	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	my	subject	 a 	 s 	 	a	writer	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	meet	the	aldo	leopold	test	?
which	is	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	make	us	better	 citizen 	 s 	 	of	the	biotic	community	?
get	us	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	the	support	and	 perpetu 	 ation 	 	of	the	 bio 	 ta 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 it 	 s 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	?
and	i	would	submit	that	 th 	 is 	 	idea	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	let	me	go	through	what	you	gain	when	you	look	at	the	world	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	some	 entertain 	 ing 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	about	human	 desir 	 e 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	intellectual	matter	,	looking	at	the	world	from	other	species	'	 point 	 s 	 	of	view	 help 	 s 	 	us	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	weird	 anomal 	 y 	 	,	which	is	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	realm	of	intellectual	 histo 	 ry 	 	--	which	is	that	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	darwinian	revolution	150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	...
ugh	.	mini	-	me	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	intellectual	,	 th 	 is 	 	darwinian	revolution	in	which	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	darwin	,	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	we	are	just	one	species	among	 man 	 y 	 	;	evolution	is	 work 	 ing 	 	on	us	the	same	way	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	on	all	the	 other 	 s 	 	;	we	are	 act 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	;	we	are	 re 	 ally 	 	in	the	fiber	,	the	fabric	of	life	.
but	the	weird	thing	is	,	we	have	not	 absorb 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 less 	 on 	 	150	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	;	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	are	still	cartesians	--	the	children	of	descartes	--	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 subject 	 ivity 	 	,	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	 set 	 s 	 	us	 a 	 part 	 	;	that	the	world	is	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	and	 object 	 s 	 	;	that	there	is	nature	on	one	side	,	culture	on	 an 	 other 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	you	start	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	from	the	plant	's	point	of	view	or	the	animal	's	point	of	view	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	the	real	 liter 	 ary 	 	 conce 	 it 	 	is	that	--	is	the	idea	that	nature	is	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	culture	,	the	idea	that	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	 every 	 thing 	 	--	and	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
looking	at	the	world	from	other	species	'	 point 	 s 	 	of	view	is	a	cure	for	the	disease	of	human	self	-	 import 	 ance 	 	.
you	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 conscious 	 ness 	 	--	which	we	value	and	we	consider	the	 crown 	 ing 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 	of	nature	,	human	 conscious 	 ness 	 	--	is	 re 	 ally 	 	just	 an 	 other 	 	set	of	 tool 	 s 	 	for	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 long 	 	in	the	world	.
and	it	's	kind	of	natural	that	we	would	think	it	was	the	best	tool	.
but	,	you	know	,	there	's	a	comedian	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	who	's	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	so	good	and	so	 import 	 ant 	 	?
well	,	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.	``
so	when	you	look	at	the	 plant 	 s 	 	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	there	are	other	 tool 	 s 	 	and	they	're	just	 a 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	from	the	garden	:	 lim 	 a 	 	 bean 	 s 	 	.	you	know	what	a	 lim 	 a 	 	bean	 do 	 es 	 	when	it	's	 attack 	 ed 	 	by	spider	 mite 	 s 	 	?
it	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 volatil 	 e 	 	chemical	that	 go 	 es 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	and	 summon 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	species	of	mite	that	 come 	 s 	 	in	and	 attack 	 s 	 	the	spider	mite	,	 defend 	 ing 	 	the	 lim 	 a 	 	bean	.
so	what	 plant 	 s 	 	have	--	while	we	have	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	tool	making	,	language	,	they	have	 bio 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
and	they	have	 perfect 	 ed 	 	that	to	a	degree	far	beyond	what	we	can	imagine	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 sophistic 	 ation 	 	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	marvel	at	,	and	i	think	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	scandal	of	the	human	genome	project	.
you	know	,	we	went	 in 	 to 	 	it	 think 	 ing 	 	,	40,000	or	50,000	human	 gene 	 s 	 	and	we	came	out	with	 on 	 ly 	 	23,000	.
just	to	give	you	 ground 	 s 	 	for	 compar 	 ison 	 	,	rice	:	35,000	 gene 	 s 	 	.
so	who	's	the	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	species	?
well	,	we	're	all	 equal 	 ly 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	long	,	just	 a 	 long 	 	different	 path 	 s 	 	.
so	,	cure	for	self	-	 import 	 ance 	 	,	way	to	sort	of	make	us	feel	the	darwinian	idea	.
and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	do	 a 	 s 	 	a	writer	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 story 	 teller 	 	,	is	try	to	make	people	feel	what	we	know	and	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	help	us	think	 eco 	 logically 	 	.
now	,	the	other	use	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	practical	.
and	i	'm	going	to	take	you	to	a	farm	right	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	used	 th 	 is 	 	idea	to	develop	my	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	food	system	and	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	in	fact	,	is	that	we	are	all	,	now	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 manipul 	 ated 	 	by	corn	.
and	the	talk	you	heard	about	ethanol	 ear 	 lier 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	to	me	,	is	the	final	triumph	of	corn	over	good	sense	.
it	is	part	of	corn	's	scheme	for	world	 domin 	 ation 	 	.
and	you	will	see	,	the	amount	of	corn	 plant 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	will	be	up	 dramat 	 ically 	 	from	last	year	and	there	will	be	that	much	more	 habit 	 at 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 decide 	 d 	 	ethanol	is	going	to	help	us	.
so	it	 help 	 ed 	 	me	understand	industrial	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	which	of	course	is	a	cartesian	system	.
it	's	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	we	bend	other	species	to	our	will	and	that	we	are	in	charge	,	and	that	we	create	these	 factor 	 ies 	 	and	we	have	these	 techno 	 logical 	 	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	and	we	get	the	food	out	of	it	or	the	fuel	or	 what 	 ever 	 	we	want	.
let	me	take	you	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	kind	of	farm	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	farm	in	the	shenandoah	 val 	 ley 	 	of	virginia	.
i	went	looking	for	a	farm	where	these	 idea 	 s 	 	about	looking	at	 thing 	 s 	 	from	the	species	'	point	of	view	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 implement 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	found	it	in	a	man	.	the	 farm 	 er 	 	's	name	is	joel	salatin	.
and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	week	 a 	 s 	 	an	apprentice	on	his	farm	,	and	i	took	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	some	of	the	most	 hope 	 ful 	 	news	about	our	relationship	to	nature	that	i	've	ever	come	 a 	 cross 	 	in	25	 year 	 s 	 	of	writing	about	nature	.
and	that	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	farm	is	 call 	 ed 	 	polyface	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	...
the	idea	is	he	's	got	six	different	species	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	some	 plant 	 s 	 	,	growing	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	elaborate	 sym 	 biotic 	 	 arrange 	 ment 	 	.
it	's	 perma 	 culture 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	know	a	little	bit	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	the	 cow 	 s 	 	and	the	 pig 	 s 	 	and	the	sheep	and	the	 tur 	 key 	 s 	 	and	the	...
what	else	 do 	 es 	 	he	have	?
all	the	six	different	species	--	 rabbi 	 ts 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	are	all	 perform 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 logical 	 	 service 	 s 	 	for	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	the	 man 	 ure 	 	of	one	is	the	lunch	for	the	other	and	they	take	care	of	 pest 	 s 	 	for	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	elaborate	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	dance	,	but	i	'm	going	to	just	give	you	a	close	-	up	on	one	piece	of	it	,	and	that	is	the	relationship	between	his	cattle	and	his	 chicken 	 s 	 	,	his	 lay 	 ing 	 	hens	.
and	i	'll	show	you	,	if	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	approach	,	what	you	get	,	ok	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	lot	more	than	growing	food	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	'll	see	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	different	way	to	think	about	nature	and	a	way	to	get	away	from	the	zero	-	sum	 not 	 ion 	 	,	the	cartesian	idea	that	either	nature	's	winning	or	we	're	winning	,	and	that	for	us	to	get	what	we	want	,	nature	is	 diminish 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	one	day	,	cattle	in	a	pen	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	technology	 involve 	 d 	 	here	is	 th 	 is 	 	cheap	electric	 f 	 encing 	 	:	 relat 	 ively 	 	new	,	 hook 	 ed 	 	to	a	car	 batt 	 ery 	 	;	even	i	could	carry	a	quarter	-	acre	 pad 	 dock 	 	,	set	it	up	in	15	 minute 	 s 	 	.
 cow 	 s 	 	graze	one	day	.	they	move	,	ok	?
they	graze	 every 	 thing 	 	down	,	intensive	grazing	.
he	 wait 	 s 	 	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	 tow 	 ed 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	eggmobile	.
the	eggmobile	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 rick 	 ety 	 	contraption	--	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	prairie	 sch 	 oon 	 er 	 	made	out	of	 board 	 s 	 	--	but	it	 house 	 s 	 	350	 chicken 	 s 	 	.
he	 tow 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pad 	 dock 	 	three	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	and	 open 	 s 	 	the	 gang 	 plank 	 	,	 turn 	 s 	 	them	down	,	and	350	hens	come	 stream 	 ing 	 	down	the	 gang 	 plank 	 	--	 c 	 luck 	 ing 	 	,	 gossip 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 chicken 	 s 	 	will	--	and	they	make	a	 bee 	 line 	 	for	the	cow	 pat 	 ties 	 	.
and	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	:	they	're	 dig 	 ging 	 	through	the	cow	 pat 	 ties 	 	for	the	maggots	,	the	 grub 	 s 	 	,	the	 larva 	 e 	 	of	flies	.
and	the	reason	he	's	 wait 	 ed 	 	three	 day 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 know 	 s 	 	that	on	the	fourth	day	or	the	fifth	day	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 larva 	 e 	 	will	hatch	and	he	'll	have	a	huge	fly	problem	.
but	he	 wait 	 s 	 	that	long	to	grow	them	 a 	 s 	 	big	and	 ju 	 ic 	 y 	 	and	tasty	 a 	 s 	 	he	can	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	the	 chicken 	 s 	 	'	 favor 	 ite 	 	form	of	protein	.
so	the	 chicken 	 s 	 	do	 the 	 ir 	 	kind	of	little	 break 	 dance 	 	and	they	're	 push 	 ing 	 	around	the	 man 	 ure 	 	to	get	at	the	 grub 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	process	they	're	 spread 	 ing 	 	the	 man 	 ure 	 	out	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	second	 eco 	 system 	 	service	.
and	third	,	while	they	're	in	 th 	 is 	 	 pad 	 dock 	 	they	are	,	of	course	,	 defec 	 ating 	 	 mad 	 ly 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 nitrogen 	 ous 	 	 man 	 ure 	 	is	 fertil 	 izing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	field	.
they	then	move	out	to	the	next	one	,	and	in	the	course	of	just	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	,	the	grass	just	 enter 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	blaze	of	growth	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	four	or	five	 week 	 s 	 	,	he	can	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
he	can	graze	 aga 	 in 	 	,	he	can	cut	,	he	can	 br 	 ing 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	species	,	like	the	 lamb 	 s 	 	,	or	he	can	make	hay	for	the	winter	.
now	,	i	want	you	to	just	look	 re 	 ally 	 	close	up	onto	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	.
so	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	productive	system	.
and	what	i	need	to	tell	you	is	that	on	100	 acre 	 s 	 	he	 get 	 s 	 	40,000	 pound 	 s 	 	of	beef	;	30,000	 pound 	 s 	 	of	pork	;	25,000	dozen	 egg 	 s 	 	;	20,000	 broil 	 ers 	 	;	1,000	 tur 	 key 	 s 	 	;	1,000	 rabbi 	 ts 	 	--	an	immense	amount	of	food	.
you	know	,	you	hear	,	``	can	 organ 	 ic 	 	feed	the	world	?	``
well	,	look	how	much	food	you	can	produce	on	100	 acre 	 s 	 	if	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	...
 aga 	 in 	 	,	give	each	species	what	it	 want 	 s 	 	,	let	it	 real 	 ize 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 desir 	 es 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 ness 	 	.
put	that	in	play	.
but	look	at	it	from	the	point	of	view	of	the	grass	,	now	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	grass	when	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
when	a	 rumi 	 nant 	 	 graze 	 s 	 	grass	,	the	grass	is	cut	from	 th 	 is 	 	height	to	 th 	 is 	 	height	,	and	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
any	one	of	you	who	 garden 	 s 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	root	-	shoot	ratio	,	and	 plant 	 s 	 	need	to	keep	the	root	mass	in	some	rough	balance	with	the	leaf	mass	to	be	happy	.
so	when	they	lose	a	lot	of	leaf	mass	,	they	shed	 root 	 s 	 	;	they	kind	of	cauterize	them	and	the	 root 	 s 	 	die	.
and	the	species	in	the	 s 	 oil 	 	go	to	work	 bas 	 ically 	 	 chew 	 ing 	 	through	 t 	 hose 	 	 root 	 s 	 	,	 de 	 com 	 posing 	 	them	--	the	 earth 	 worm 	 s 	 	,	the	fungi	,	the	bacteria	--	and	the	result	is	new	 s 	 oil 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	 s 	 oil 	 	is	 create 	 d 	 	.
it	's	 create 	 d 	 	from	the	bottom	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	 prairie 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	built	,	the	relationship	between	 bi 	 son 	 	and	 grass 	 es 	 	.
and	what	i	 real 	 ized 	 	when	i	 under 	 stood 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	if	you	ask	joel	salatin	what	he	is	,	he	'll	tell	you	he	's	not	a	chicken	 farm 	 er 	 	,	he	's	not	a	sheep	 farm 	 er 	 	,	he	's	not	a	cattle	 ranch 	 er 	 	;	he	's	a	grass	 farm 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	grass	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 key 	 stone 	 	species	of	 s 	 uch 	 	a	system	--	is	that	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 contradict 	 s 	 	the	tragic	idea	of	nature	we	hold	in	our	 head 	 s 	 	,	which	is	that	for	us	to	get	what	we	want	,	nature	is	 diminish 	 ed 	 	.
more	for	us	,	less	for	nature	.
here	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	food	 come 	 s 	 	off	 th 	 is 	 	farm	,	and	at	the	end	of	the	season	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 s 	 oil 	 	,	more	 fertil 	 ity 	 	and	more	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
it	's	a	 remark 	 ably 	 	 hope 	 ful 	 	thing	to	do	.
there	are	a	lot	of	 farm 	 ers 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	well	beyond	 organ 	 ic 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	which	is	still	a	cartesian	system	,	more	or	less	.
and	what	it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	is	that	if	you	begin	to	take	account	of	other	species	,	take	account	of	the	 s 	 oil 	 	,	that	even	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ival 	 	idea	--	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	no	technology	 involve 	 d 	 	here	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 f 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	which	are	so	cheap	they	could	be	all	over	africa	in	no	time	--	that	we	can	take	the	food	we	need	from	the	earth	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	heal	the	earth	in	the	process	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	way	to	 re 	 animate 	 	the	world	,	and	that	's	what	's	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
when	we	 re 	 ally 	 	begin	to	feel	darwin	's	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	in	our	 bone 	 s 	 	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	do	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	these	 idea 	 s 	 	are	 some 	 thing 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 hope 	 ful 	 	about	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
