i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	from	a	secular	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	and	even	from	a	kind	of	scientific	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	try	to	give	you	a	little	bit	of	a	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	be	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	using	kind	of	 clinic 	 al 	 	language	,	and	so	it	's	not	going	to	sound	 a 	 s 	 	warm	and	 fuzz 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	your	average	 compass 	 ion 	 	talk	.
i	want	to	 war 	 n 	 	you	about	that	.
so	,	i	do	want	to	say	,	at	the	 out 	 set 	 	,	that	i	think	 compass 	 ion 	 	's	great	.
the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	is	great	.	i	'm	a	big	 support 	 er 	 	of	both	.
and	i	think	it	's	great	that	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	the	 relig 	 ions 	 	of	the	world	are	 affirm 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	 a 	 s 	 	fundamental	 principle 	 s 	 	that	are	 integ 	 ral 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 faith 	 s 	 	.
at	the	same	time	,	i	think	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	n't	deserve	all	the	credit	.
i	think	nature	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	 help 	 ing 	 	hand	here	.
i	'm	going	to	 argu 	 e 	 	 to 	 night 	 	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	are	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	built	 in 	 to 	 	human	nature	.
but	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	once	you	understand	the	sense	in	which	they	are	built	 in 	 to 	 	human	nature	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	just	 affirm 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	 affirm 	 ing 	 	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
there	's	a	lot	of	work	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	after	that	.
ok	so	,	a	quick	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	first	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	there	was	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	i	mean	not	just	when	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	first	 show 	 ed 	 	up	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	even	before	that	.
i	think	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	case	that	,	in	the	human	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 line 	 age 	 	,	even	before	there	 we 	 re 	 	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	like	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	love	and	 sympath 	 y 	 	had	 earn 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	way	 in 	 to 	 	the	gene	pool	,	and	 biologist 	 s 	 	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	clear	idea	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	first	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
it	 happen 	 ed 	 	through	a	principle	known	 a 	 s 	 	kin	 s 	 election 	 	.
and	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	of	kin	 s 	 election 	 	is	that	,	if	an	animal	 feel 	 s 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	for	a	close	 relat 	 ive 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	the	animal	to	help	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	,	then	,	in	the	end	,	the	 compass 	 ion 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 wind 	 s 	 	up	 help 	 ing 	 	the	 gene 	 s 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	the	 compass 	 ion 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	,	from	a	biologist	's	point	of	view	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	gene	's	way	of	 help 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.	ok	.
i	 war 	 ned 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	warm	and	 fuzz 	 y 	 	.
i	'll	get	there	--	i	hope	to	get	a	little	 fuzz 	 ier 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 both 	 er 	 	me	so	much	,	that	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	darwinian	 rational 	 e 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	kind	of	self	-	 serv 	 ing 	 	at	the	genetic	level	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	the	bad	news	about	kin	 s 	 election 	 	is	just	that	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 natural 	 ly 	 	 deploy 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	family	.
that	's	the	bad	news	.	the	good	news	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	natural	.
the	bad	news	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	kin	 select 	 ed 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 natural 	 ly 	 	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	to	the	family	.
now	,	there	's	more	good	news	that	came	 a 	 long 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	evolution	,	a	second	kind	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	logic	.
 biologist 	 s 	 	call	that	``	 reciproc 	 al 	 	 al 	 truism 	 	.	``	ok	.
and	there	,	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	is	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	you	to	do	good	 thing 	 s 	 	for	people	who	then	will	return	the	favor	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 a 	 s 	 	inspiring	a	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	may	have	heard	in	the	past	,	but	from	a	biologist	's	point	of	view	,	 th 	 is 	 	 reciproc 	 al 	 	 al 	 truism 	 	kind	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	self	-	 serv 	 ing 	 	too	.
it	's	not	that	people	think	that	,	when	they	feel	the	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	not	 conscious 	 ly 	 	self	-	 serv 	 ing 	 	,	but	to	a	biologist	,	that	's	the	logic	.
and	so	,	you	wind	up	most	 eas 	 ily 	 	 extend 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	to	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 lies 	 	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	a	lot	of	you	,	if	a	close	friend	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	happen	to	them	,	you	feel	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	.
but	if	you	read	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	you	've	never	heard	of	,	you	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	live	with	that	.
that	's	just	human	nature	.
so	,	it	's	 an 	 other 	 	good	news	/	bad	news	story	.
it	's	good	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	was	 extend 	 ed 	 	beyond	the	family	by	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	logic	.
the	bad	news	is	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	us	universal	 compass 	 ion 	 	by	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	,	there	's	still	work	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
now	,	there	's	one	other	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	dynamic	 call 	 ed 	 	 reciproc 	 al 	 	 al 	 truism 	 	,	which	i	think	is	kind	of	good	news	,	which	is	that	the	way	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 play 	 ed 	 	out	in	the	human	species	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	people	an	intuitive	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	.
i	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	mean	that	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	 it 	 self 	 	is	written	in	our	 gene 	 s 	 	,	but	you	can	go	to	a	hunter	gatherer	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	had	no	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	any	of	the	great	religious	 tradition 	 s 	 	,	no	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	 ethic 	 al 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	and	you	'll	find	,	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	time	with	these	people	,	that	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	they	 believ 	 e 	 	that	one	good	turn	 deserve 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	that	bad	 de 	 ed 	 s 	 	should	be	 punish 	 ed 	 	.
and	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 psycho 	 logists 	 	think	that	these	 intuit 	 ions 	 	have	a	 bas 	 is 	 	in	the	 gene 	 s 	 	.
so	,	they	do	understand	that	if	you	want	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	well	,	you	treat	other	people	well	.
and	it	's	good	to	treat	other	people	well	.
that	's	close	to	 be 	 ing 	 	a	kind	of	built	-	in	 intuit 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	that	's	good	news	.	now	,	if	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	,	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	 anticip 	 ating 	 	that	there	's	bad	news	here	;	we	still	are	n't	to	universal	love	,	and	it	's	true	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	an	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	is	natural	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	natural	to	carve	out	 exception 	 s 	 	to	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	.
i	mean	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	want	to	go	to	 pri 	 son 	 	,	but	we	all	think	that	there	are	some	people	who	should	go	to	 pri 	 son 	 	.	right	?
so	,	we	think	we	should	treat	them	 different 	 ly 	 	than	we	would	want	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	we	have	a	 rational 	 e 	 	for	that	.
we	say	they	did	these	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	it	just	that	they	should	go	to	 pri 	 son 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	us	 re 	 ally 	 	 extend 	 s 	 	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	in	 tru 	 ly 	 	diffuse	and	universal	fashion	.
we	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	carve	out	 exception 	 s 	 	,	put	people	in	a	special	 categor 	 y 	 	.
and	the	problem	is	that	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	in	the	case	of	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	people	to	 pri 	 son 	 	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 partial 	 	 judi 	 ci 	 ary 	 	 determi 	 ning 	 	who	 get 	 s 	 	 exclude 	 d 	 	from	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	--	that	in	 every 	 day 	 	life	,	the	way	we	all	make	these	 decision 	 s 	 	about	who	we	're	not	going	to	extend	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	to	,	is	we	use	a	much	 rough 	 er 	 	and	 read 	 ier 	 	formula	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	it	's	just	like	,	if	you	're	my	 ene 	 my 	 	,	if	you	're	my	rival	--	if	you	're	not	my	friend	,	if	you	're	not	in	my	family	--	i	'm	much	less	 inc 	 lined 	 	to	 app 	 ly 	 	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	to	you	.
we	all	do	that	,	and	you	see	it	all	over	the	world	.
you	see	it	in	the	middle	east	:	people	who	,	from	gaza	,	are	 fir 	 ing 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 s 	 	at	israel	.
they	would	n't	want	to	have	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 s 	 	 fire 	 d 	 	at	them	,	but	they	say	,	``	well	,	but	the	israelis	,	or	some	of	them	have	 d 	 one 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	put	them	in	a	special	 categor 	 y 	 	.	``
the	israelis	would	not	want	to	have	an	economic	blockade	 impose 	 d 	 	on	them	,	but	they	impose	one	on	gaza	,	and	they	say	,	``	well	,	the	palestinians	,	or	some	of	them	,	have	 br 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	``
so	,	it	's	these	 ex 	 clusion 	 s 	 	to	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	that	amount	to	a	lot	of	the	world	's	trouble	.
and	it	's	natural	to	do	that	.
so	,	the	fact	that	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	is	in	some	sense	built	in	to	us	is	not	,	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	us	universal	love	.
it	's	not	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
now	,	there	's	one	piece	of	good	news	i	have	that	may	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
are	you	on	the	 edge 	 s 	 	of	your	 seat 	 s 	 	here	?
good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	before	i	tell	you	about	that	good	news	,	i	'm	going	to	have	to	take	a	little	 ex 	 cur 	 s 	 ion 	 	through	some	academic	 terra 	 in 	 	.
so	,	i	hope	i	've	got	your	attention	with	 th 	 is 	 	promise	of	good	news	that	may	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	non	-	zero	-	sumness	stuff	you	just	heard	a	little	bit	about	.
it	's	just	a	quick	 introduc 	 tion 	 	to	game	 theor 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	wo	n't	hurt	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
it	's	about	zero	-	sum	and	non	-	zero	-	sum	 game 	 s 	 	.
if	you	ask	what	kind	of	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	 con 	 duc 	 ive 	 	to	people	 be 	 coming 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 lies 	 	,	the	technical	answer	is	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
and	if	you	ask	what	kind	of	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	 con 	 duc 	 ive 	 	to	people	 defi 	 ning 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	 ene 	 mies 	 	,	it	's	a	zero	-	sum	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
so	,	what	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 term 	 s 	 	mean	?
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	a	zero	-	sum	game	is	the	kind	you	're	used	to	in	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	,	where	there	's	a	winner	and	a	 lose 	 r 	 	.
so	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 fortune 	 s 	 	add	up	to	zero	.
so	,	in	tennis	,	every	point	is	either	good	for	you	and	bad	for	the	other	person	,	or	good	for	them	,	bad	for	you	.
either	way	,	your	 fortune 	 s 	 	add	up	to	zero	.	that	's	a	zero	-	sum	game	.
now	,	if	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	 double 	 s 	 	,	then	the	person	on	your	side	of	the	net	is	in	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationship	with	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	point	is	either	good	for	both	of	you	--	positive	,	win	-	win	--	or	bad	for	both	of	you	,	it	's	lose	-	lose	.
that	's	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	game	.
and	in	real	life	,	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	non	-	zero	-	sum	 game 	 s 	 	.
in	the	realm	of	 economic 	 s 	 	,	say	,	if	you	buy	 some 	 thing 	 	:	that	 mean 	 s 	 	you	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	have	the	 merchan 	 dis 	 e 	 	than	the	money	,	but	the	 merchan 	 t 	 	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	have	the	money	than	the	 merchan 	 dis 	 e 	 	.
you	both	feel	you	've	won	.
in	a	war	,	two	 al 	 lies 	 	are	 play 	 ing 	 	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	game	.
it	's	going	to	either	be	win	-	win	or	lose	-	lose	for	them	.
so	,	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	non	-	zero	-	sum	 game 	 s 	 	in	real	life	.
and	you	could	 bas 	 ically 	 	 reform 	 ulate 	 	what	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	about	how	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 deploy 	 ed 	 	and	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	is	 deploy 	 ed 	 	,	by	just	 say 	 ing 	 	,	well	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	most	 natural 	 ly 	 	 flow 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	non	-	zero	-	sum	 channel 	 s 	 	where	people	perceive	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	 potential 	 ly 	 	win	-	win	 situ 	 ation 	 	with	some	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	or	 al 	 lies 	 	.
the	 deploy 	 ment 	 	of	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	most	 natural 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	these	non	-	zero	-	sum	 channel 	 s 	 	.
so	,	kind	of	 web 	 s 	 	of	non	-	zero	-	sumness	are	where	you	would	expect	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	to	kind	of	work	 the 	 ir 	 	magic	.
with	zero	-	sum	 channel 	 s 	 	you	would	expect	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	,	now	you	're	ready	for	the	good	news	that	i	 s 	 aid 	 	might	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
and	now	i	can	admit	that	it	might	not	too	,	now	that	i	've	held	your	attention	for	three	 minute 	 s 	 	of	technical	stuff	.
but	it	may	.	and	the	good	news	is	that	 histo 	 ry 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	 expand 	 ed 	 	these	 web 	 s 	 	of	non	-	zero	-	sumness	,	these	 web 	 s 	 	that	can	be	these	 channel 	 s 	 	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
you	can	go	back	all	the	way	to	the	stone	age	:	 techno 	 logical 	 	evolution	--	 road 	 s 	 	,	the	wheel	,	writing	,	a	lot	of	 transport 	 ation 	 	and	communication	 techno 	 logies 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 inexor 	 ably 	 	made	it	so	that	more	people	can	be	in	more	non	-	zero	-	sum	 relationship 	 s 	 	with	more	and	more	people	at	 great 	 er 	 	and	 great 	 er 	 	 distance 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	story	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
it	's	why	social	 organ 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	from	the	hunter	-	gatherer	village	to	the	ancient	state	,	the	empire	,	and	now	here	we	are	in	a	 global 	 ized 	 	world	.
and	the	story	of	 global 	 ization 	 	is	 large 	 ly 	 	a	story	of	non	-	zero	-	sumness	.
you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	the	term	``	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	``	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	the	modern	world	.	well	,	that	's	just	 an 	 other 	 	term	for	non	-	zero	-	sum	.
if	your	 fortune 	 s 	 	are	 inter 	 dependent 	 	with	 some 	 body 	 	,	then	you	live	in	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationship	with	them	.
and	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	all	the	time	in	the	modern	world	.
you	saw	it	with	the	 re 	 cent 	 	economic	crash	,	where	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	--	bad	for	 every 	 body 	 	,	for	much	of	the	world	.
good	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	,	and	it	's	good	for	much	of	the	world	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	'm	happy	to	say	,	i	think	there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	evidence	that	 th 	 is 	 	non	-	zero	-	sum	kind	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	can	expand	the	moral	compass	.
i	mean	,	if	you	look	at	the	american	 attitude 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	japanese	 dur 	 ing 	 	world	war	ii	--	look	at	the	 depict 	 ions 	 	of	japanese	in	the	american	media	 a 	 s 	 	just	about	 sub 	 human 	 	,	and	look	at	the	fact	that	we	 drop 	 ped 	 	atomic	 bomb 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 with 	 out 	 	giving	it	much	of	a	thought	--	and	you	 compar 	 e 	 	that	to	the	attitude	now	,	i	think	part	of	that	is	due	to	a	kind	of	economic	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	.
any	form	of	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	or	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationship	 force 	 s 	 	you	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	the	 human 	 ity 	 	of	people	.
so	,	i	think	that	's	good	.
and	the	world	is	full	of	non	-	zero	-	sum	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
 environment 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	put	us	all	in	the	same	boat	.
and	there	are	non	-	zero	-	sum	 relationship 	 s 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	people	are	n't	aware	of	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	lot	of	american	christians	do	n't	think	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationship	with	muslims	 half 	 way 	 	around	the	world	,	but	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	these	muslims	 be 	 come 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	and	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	place	in	the	world	and	feel	that	they	have	a	place	in	it	,	that	's	good	for	americans	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	will	be	 few 	 er 	 	 terrorist 	 s 	 	to	threaten	american	security	.
if	they	get	less	and	less	happy	,	that	will	be	bad	for	americans	.
so	,	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	non	-	zero	-	sumness	.
and	so	,	the	question	is	:	if	there	's	so	much	non	-	zero	-	sumness	,	why	 ha 	 s 	 	the	world	not	yet	 be 	 en 	 	 suff 	 used 	 	in	love	,	peace	,	and	 understand 	 ing 	 	?
the	answer	's	 complic 	 ated 	 	.	it	's	the	occasion	for	a	whole	other	talk	.
 certain 	 ly 	 	,	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	are	that	,	first	of	all	,	there	are	a	lot	of	zero	-	sum	 situ 	 ations 	 	in	the	world	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	do	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	non	-	zero	-	sum	 dynamic 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
in	both	of	these	 area 	 s 	 	,	i	think	 politic 	 ians 	 	can	play	a	role	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 on 	 ly 	 	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
i	think	 politic 	 ians 	 	can	help	foster	non	-	zero	-	sum	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	economic	 engage 	 ment 	 	is	 general 	 ly 	 	better	than	 blockade 	 s 	 	and	so	on	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	regard	.
and	 politic 	 ians 	 	can	be	aware	,	and	should	be	aware	that	,	when	people	around	the	world	are	looking	at	them	,	are	looking	at	 the 	 ir 	 	nation	and	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 cue 	 s 	 	for	 whet 	 her 	 	they	are	in	a	zero	-	sum	or	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationship	with	a	nation	--	like	,	say	,	america	,	or	any	other	nation	--	human	 psycho 	 logy 	 	is	 s 	 uch 	 	that	they	use	 cue 	 s 	 	like	:	do	we	feel	we	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 respect 	 ed 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	if	you	're	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 respect 	 ed 	 	,	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	going	to	wind	up	in	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	,	 mutual 	 ly 	 	 profit 	 able 	 	relationship	with	people	.
so	,	we	need	to	be	aware	of	what	kind	of	 signal 	 s 	 	we	're	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	out	.
and	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	in	the	realm	of	 politic 	 al 	 	work	.
if	there	's	one	thing	i	can	 encourag 	 e 	 	 every 	 one 	 	to	do	,	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	religious	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	and	us	,	it	would	be	what	i	call	``	 expand 	 ing 	 	the	moral	 imagin 	 ation 	 	``	--	that	is	to	say	,	your	ability	to	put	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	of	people	in	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	but	it	's	 con 	 duc 	 ive 	 	to	 compass 	 ion 	 	.	it	 open 	 s 	 	the	 channel 	 s 	 	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	we	have	 an 	 other 	 	good	news	/	bad	news	story	,	which	is	that	the	moral	 imagin 	 ation 	 	is	part	of	human	nature	.
that	's	good	,	but	 aga 	 in 	 	we	tend	to	deploy	it	 select 	 ively 	 	.
once	we	define	 some 	 body 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ene 	 my 	 	,	we	have	trouble	 put 	 ting 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	just	 natural 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	if	you	want	to	take	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	hard	case	for	an	american	:	 some 	 body 	 	in	iran	who	is	 burn 	 ing 	 	an	american	flag	,	and	you	see	them	on	tv	.
well	,	the	average	american	is	going	to	resist	the	moral	 exercis 	 e 	 	of	 put 	 ting 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	that	person	's	head	and	is	going	to	resist	the	idea	that	they	have	much	in	common	with	that	person	.
and	if	you	tell	them	,	``	well	,	they	think	america	 dis 	 respect 	 s 	 	them	and	even	 want 	 s 	 	to	dominate	them	,	and	they	hate	america	.
 ha 	 s 	 	there	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	 dis 	 respect 	 ed 	 	you	so	much	that	you	kind	of	 hat 	 ed 	 	them	 brief 	 ly 	 	``	?
you	know	,	they	'll	resist	that	 compar 	 ison 	 	and	that	's	natural	,	that	's	human	.
and	,	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	the	person	in	iran	:	when	you	try	to	 human 	 ize 	 	 some 	 body 	 	in	america	who	 s 	 aid 	 	that	islam	is	 e 	 vil 	 	,	they	'll	have	trouble	with	that	.
so	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	thing	to	get	people	to	expand	the	moral	 imagin 	 ation 	 	to	a	place	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 natural 	 ly 	 	go	.
i	think	it	's	worth	the	trouble	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	just	 help 	 s 	 	us	to	understand	.
if	you	want	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	number	of	people	who	are	 burn 	 ing 	 	 flag 	 s 	 	,	it	 help 	 s 	 	to	understand	what	 make 	 s 	 	them	do	it	.
and	i	think	it	's	good	moral	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
i	would	say	here	is	where	religious	 lead 	 ers 	 	come	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	religious	 lead 	 ers 	 	are	good	at	 re 	 framing 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	for	people	,	at	 harness 	 ing 	 	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	 center 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	to	get	people	to	alter	 the 	 ir 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	and	 re 	 frame 	 	the	way	they	think	.
i	mean	,	religious	 lead 	 ers 	 	are	kind	of	in	the	inspiration	business	.
it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	great	 call 	 ing 	 	right	now	,	to	get	people	all	around	the	world	better	at	 expand 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	moral	 imagin 	 ations 	 	,	 appreci 	 ating 	 	that	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	ways	they	're	in	the	same	boat	.
i	would	just	sum	up	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	look	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	secular	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	go	,	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	good	news	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	are	in	some	sense	built	 in 	 to 	 	human	nature	.
it	's	 un 	 fortunate 	 	that	they	tend	to	be	 select 	 ively 	 	 deploy 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	's	going	to	take	real	work	to	change	that	.
but	,	 no 	 body 	 	ever	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 do 	 ing 	 	god	's	work	was	going	to	be	easy	.	 thank 	 s 	 	.
