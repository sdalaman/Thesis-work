when	i	was	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	american	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 associ 	 ation 	 	,	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	media	-	train	me	,	and	an	 en 	 counter 	 	i	had	with	cnn	 summarize 	 s 	 	what	i	'm	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 to 	 day 	 	,	which	is	the	 eleven 	 th 	 	reason	to	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	.
the	editor	of	discover	told	us	10	of	them	,	i	'm	going	to	give	you	the	 eleven 	 th 	 	.
so	they	came	to	me	--	cnn	--	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	professor	seligman	,	would	you	tell	us	about	the	state	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?
we	'd	like	to	interview	you	about	that	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	great	.	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	cnn	,	so	you	 on 	 ly 	 	get	a	sound	bite	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 word 	 s 	 	do	i	get	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	one	.	``
and	 camera 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	professor	seligman	,	what	is	the	state	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?	``
``	good	.	``
``	cut	.	cut	.	that	wo	n't	do	.
we	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	better	give	you	a	 long 	 er 	 	sound	bite	.	``
``	well	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 word 	 s 	 	do	i	get	 th 	 is 	 	time	?	``	``	i	think	,	well	,	you	get	two	.
doctor	seligman	,	what	is	the	state	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?	``
``	not	good	.	``
``	look	,	doctor	seligman	,	we	can	see	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 comfort 	 able 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	medium	.
we	'd	better	give	you	a	real	sound	bite	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	you	can	have	three	 word 	 s 	 	.
professor	seligman	,	what	is	the	state	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?	``
``	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.	``	and	that	's	what	i	'm	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
i	want	to	say	why	 psycho 	 logy 	 	was	good	,	why	it	was	not	good	and	how	it	may	 be 	 come 	 	,	in	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
and	by	parallel	 summ 	 ary 	 	,	i	want	to	say	the	same	thing	about	technology	,	about	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	design	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	the	 issue 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	.
so	,	why	was	 psycho 	 logy 	 	good	?
well	,	for	more	than	60	 year 	 s 	 	,	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	disease	model	.
ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	was	on	an	 air 	 plane 	 	and	i	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	my	 seat 	 mate 	 	,	and	told	them	what	i	did	,	they	'd	move	away	from	me	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 right 	 ly 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	is	about	 find 	 ing 	 	what	's	wrong	with	you	.	spot	the	 loo 	 ny 	 	.
and	now	,	when	i	tell	people	what	i	do	,	they	move	 to 	 ward 	 	me	.
and	what	was	good	about	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	about	the	30	billion	dollar	 invest 	 ment 	 	nimh	made	,	about	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	disease	model	,	about	what	you	mean	by	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	is	that	,	60	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 treat 	 able 	 	--	it	was	 entire 	 ly 	 	smoke	and	 mirror 	 s 	 	.
and	now	,	14	of	the	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	are	 treat 	 able 	 	,	two	of	them	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cur 	 able 	 	.
and	the	other	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	that	a	science	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	a	science	of	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
that	we	found	out	that	we	could	take	 fuzz 	 y 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	--	like	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	 alcohol 	 ism 	 	--	and	measure	them	with	rigor	.
that	we	could	create	a	 class 	 ification 	 	of	the	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	.
that	we	could	understand	the	 caus 	 ality 	 	of	the	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	.
we	could	look	 a 	 cross 	 	time	at	the	same	people	--	people	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	--	and	ask	what	the	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	of	 mother 	 ing 	 	,	of	 genetic 	 s 	 	are	,	and	we	could	isolate	third	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	on	the	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	.
and	best	of	all	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	,	in	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	to	invent	drug	 treat 	 ments 	 	and	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 treat 	 ments 	 	.
and	then	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	test	them	 rigor 	 ously 	 	,	in	random	 assign 	 ment 	 	,	 place 	 bo 	 	controlled	 design 	 s 	 	,	throw	out	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	did	n't	work	,	keep	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 active 	 ly 	 	did	.
and	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	of	that	is	that	 psycho 	 logy 	 	and	 psych 	 iatry 	 	,	over	the	last	60	 year 	 s 	 	,	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	claim	that	we	can	make	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	people	less	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	.
and	i	think	that	's	 terr 	 ific 	 	.	i	'm	proud	of	it	.
but	what	was	not	good	,	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	that	 we 	 re 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	first	was	moral	,	that	 psycho 	 logists 	 	and	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 victim 	 o 	 logists 	 	,	 patho 	 log 	 izer 	 s 	 	,	that	our	view	of	human	nature	was	that	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	trouble	,	 brick 	 s 	 	fell	on	you	.
and	we	 for 	 got 	 	that	people	made	 choice 	 s 	 	and	 decision 	 s 	 	.
we	 for 	 got 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.	that	was	the	first	cost	.
the	second	cost	was	that	we	 for 	 got 	 	about	you	people	.
we	 for 	 got 	 	about	 improv 	 ing 	 	normal	 live 	 s 	 	.
we	 for 	 got 	 	about	a	mission	to	make	 relat 	 ively 	 	 un 	 trouble 	 d 	 	people	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	more	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	,	more	productive	.	and	``	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	``	``	high	-	talent	,	``	 be 	 came 	 	a	 dirt 	 y 	 	word	.
no	one	 work 	 s 	 	on	that	.
and	the	third	problem	about	the	disease	model	is	,	in	our	rush	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	people	in	trouble	,	in	our	rush	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 repair 	 ing 	 	damage	,	it	never	 occur 	 red 	 	to	us	to	develop	 intervention 	 s 	 	to	make	people	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	positive	 intervention 	 s 	 	.
so	that	was	not	good	.
and	so	,	that	's	what	led	people	like	nancy	etcoff	,	dan	gilbert	,	 mi 	 ke 	 	csikszentmihalyi	and	 my 	 self 	 	to	work	in	 some 	 thing 	 	i	call	positive	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	three	 aim 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	that	 psycho 	 logy 	 	should	be	just	 a 	 s 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	human	strength	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	with	 weak 	 ness 	 	.
it	should	be	just	 a 	 s 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	building	strength	 a 	 s 	 	with	 repair 	 ing 	 	damage	.
it	should	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	best	 thing 	 s 	 	in	life	.
and	it	should	be	just	 a 	 s 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	making	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	normal	people	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	,	and	with	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	with	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	high	talent	.
so	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	and	the	hope	for	the	future	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	a	science	of	positive	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	a	science	of	what	 make 	 s 	 	life	worth	living	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	we	can	measure	different	 form 	 s 	 	of	happiness	.
and	any	of	you	,	for	free	,	can	go	to	that	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	take	the	entire	 pan 	 op 	 ly 	 	of	 test 	 s 	 	of	happiness	.
you	can	ask	,	how	do	you	stack	up	for	positive	emotion	,	for	meaning	,	for	flow	,	against	 liter 	 ally 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	other	people	?
we	 create 	 d 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	the	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	manual	of	the	 insan 	 ities 	 	:	a	 class 	 ification 	 	of	the	 strength 	 s 	 	and	 virtue 	 s 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	 s 	 ex 	 	ratio	,	how	they	're	defined	,	how	to	 diagnos 	 e 	 	them	,	what	 build 	 s 	 	them	and	what	 get 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	way	.
we	found	that	we	could	discover	the	 caus 	 ation 	 	of	the	positive	 state 	 s 	 	,	the	relationship	between	left	 hemi 	 spheric 	 	activity	and	right	 hemi 	 spheric 	 	activity	 a 	 s 	 	a	cause	of	happiness	.
i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	my	life	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	people	,	and	i	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	,	how	do	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	people	differ	from	the	rest	of	you	?
and	 start 	 ing 	 	about	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	about	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	happy	people	.
and	how	do	they	differ	from	the	rest	of	us	?
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	's	one	way	.
they	're	not	more	religious	,	they	're	not	in	better	shape	,	they	do	n't	have	more	money	,	they	're	not	better	looking	,	they	do	n't	have	more	good	 event 	 s 	 	and	 few 	 er 	 	bad	 event 	 s 	 	.
the	one	way	in	which	they	differ	:	they	're	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	social	.
they	do	n't	 s 	 it 	 	in	 semi 	 nar 	 s 	 	on	saturday	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
they	do	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	time	 al 	 one 	 	.
each	of	them	is	in	a	romantic	relationship	and	each	 ha 	 s 	 	a	rich	repertoire	of	 friend 	 s 	 	.
but	watch	out	here	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 mere 	 ly 	 	 correlation 	 al 	 	data	,	not	 caus 	 al 	 	,	and	it	's	about	happiness	in	the	first	hollywood	sense	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	:	happiness	of	 ebulli 	 ence 	 	and	 gig 	 gling 	 	and	good	cheer	.
and	i	'm	going	to	suggest	to	you	that	's	not	 near 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	in	just	a	moment	.
we	found	we	could	begin	to	look	at	 intervention 	 s 	 	over	the	centuries	,	from	the	buddha	to	tony	robbins	.
about	120	 intervention 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 pro 	 posed 	 	that	 alle 	 ged 	 ly 	 	make	people	happy	.
and	we	find	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 manual 	 ize 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	,	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	carry	out	random	 assign 	 ment 	 	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	and	 effective 	 ness 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
that	is	,	which	 one 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	people	 last 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	?
in	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	'll	tell	you	about	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 up 	 shot 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	the	mission	i	want	 psycho 	 logy 	 	to	have	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	mission	of	 cur 	 ing 	 	the	 ment 	 ally 	 	ill	,	and	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	mission	of	making	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	people	less	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	,	is	can	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	people	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	?
and	to	ask	that	question	--	happy	is	not	a	word	i	use	 ver 	 y 	 	much	--	we	've	had	to	break	it	down	 in 	 to 	 	what	i	think	is	 ask 	 able 	 	about	happy	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	there	are	three	different	--	and	i	call	them	different	 be 	 cause 	 	different	 intervention 	 s 	 	build	them	,	it	's	possible	to	have	one	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	other	--	three	different	happy	 live 	 s 	 	.
the	first	happy	life	is	the	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	life	in	which	you	have	 a 	 s 	 	much	positive	emotion	 a 	 s 	 	you	possibly	can	,	and	the	 skill 	 s 	 	to	 ampl 	 ify 	 	it	.
the	second	is	a	life	of	 engage 	 ment 	 	--	a	life	in	your	work	,	your	 parent 	 ing 	 	,	your	love	,	your	leisure	,	time	 stop 	 s 	 	for	you	.
that	's	what	aristotle	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
and	third	,	the	 meaning 	 ful 	 	life	.
so	i	want	to	say	a	little	bit	about	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	what	we	know	about	them	.
the	first	life	is	the	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	and	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	best	we	can	find	it	,	it	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 pleasure 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	positive	emotion	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	,	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	the	 skill 	 s 	 	--	 savor 	 ing 	 	,	 mind 	 fulness 	 	--	that	 ampl 	 ify 	 	them	,	that	stretch	them	over	time	and	space	.
but	the	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	 ha 	 s 	 	three	 draw 	 back 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	why	positive	 psycho 	 logy 	 	is	not	happy	-	ology	and	why	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	end	here	.
the	first	 draw 	 back 	 	is	that	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	,	your	experience	of	positive	emotion	,	is	 heri 	 table 	 	,	about	50	percent	 heri 	 table 	 	,	and	,	in	fact	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 modifi 	 able 	 	.
so	the	different	 trick 	 s 	 	that	matthieu	[	ricard	]	and	i	and	 other 	 s 	 	know	about	increasing	the	amount	of	positive	emotion	in	your	life	are	15	to	20	percent	 trick 	 s 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	more	of	it	.
second	is	that	positive	emotion	 habitu 	 ates 	 	.	it	 habitu 	 ates 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	all	like	french	 van 	 illa 	 	ice	cream	,	the	first	taste	is	a	100	percent	;	by	the	time	you	're	down	to	the	sixth	taste	,	it	's	gone	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	not	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 malle 	 able 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	the	second	life	.
and	i	have	to	tell	you	about	my	friend	,	len	,	to	talk	about	why	positive	 psycho 	 logy 	 	is	more	than	positive	emotion	,	more	than	building	pleasure	.
in	two	of	the	three	great	 arena 	 s 	 	of	life	,	by	the	time	len	was	30	,	len	was	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.	the	first	arena	was	work	.
by	the	time	he	was	20	,	he	was	an	 option 	 s 	 	 trade 	 r 	 	.
by	the	time	he	was	25	,	he	was	a	 multi 	 millionaire 	 	and	the	head	of	an	 option 	 s 	 	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	company	.
second	,	in	play	--	he	's	a	national	champion	bridge	player	.
but	in	the	third	great	arena	of	life	,	love	,	len	is	an	 a 	 by 	 s 	 mal 	 	failure	.
and	the	reason	he	was	,	was	that	len	is	a	cold	fish	.
len	is	an	introvert	.
american	women	 s 	 aid 	 	to	len	,	when	he	 d 	 ated 	 	them	,	``	you	're	no	 f 	 un 	 	.	you	do	n't	have	positive	emotion	.	get	lost	.	``
and	len	was	 wealth 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	able	to	afford	a	park	 a 	 venue 	 	 psycho 	 analyst 	 	,	who	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	find	the	sexual	trauma	that	had	 some 	 how 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	positive	emotion	 in 	 side 	 	of	him	.
but	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	there	was	n't	any	sexual	trauma	.
it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	--	len	grew	up	in	long	 is 	 land 	 	and	he	 play 	 ed 	 	 foot 	 ball 	 	and	 watch 	 ed 	 	 foot 	 ball 	 	,	and	 play 	 ed 	 	bridge	--	len	is	in	the	bottom	five	percent	of	what	we	call	positive	 affect 	 iv 	 ities 	 	.
the	question	is	,	is	len	 un 	 happy 	 	?	and	i	want	to	say	not	.
 contr 	 ary 	 	to	what	 psycho 	 logy 	 	told	us	about	the	bottom	50	percent	of	the	human	race	in	positive	 affect 	 ivity 	 	,	i	think	len	is	one	of	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	people	i	know	.
he	's	not	 con 	 sign 	 ed 	 	to	the	hell	of	 un 	 happiness 	 	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	len	,	like	most	of	you	,	is	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	flow	.
when	he	 walk 	 s 	 	onto	the	floor	of	the	american	 ex 	 change 	 	at	9:30	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	time	 stop 	 s 	 	for	him	.	and	it	 stop 	 s 	 	till	the	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	bell	.
when	the	first	card	is	 play 	 ed 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	10	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	tournament	is	over	,	time	 stop 	 s 	 	for	len	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	what	 mi 	 ke 	 	csikszentmihalyi	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	about	flow	.	and	it	's	distinct	from	pleasure	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	way	.
pleasure	 ha 	 s 	 	raw	 feel 	 s 	 	:	you	know	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	thought	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
but	what	 mi 	 ke 	 	told	you	 yester 	 day 	 	--	 dur 	 ing 	 	flow	,	you	ca	n't	feel	 any 	 thing 	 	.
you	're	one	with	the	music	.	time	 stop 	 s 	 	.
you	have	 intens 	 e 	 	 concent 	 ration 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	the	 character 	 istic 	 	of	what	we	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	the	good	life	.
and	we	think	there	's	a	recipe	for	it	,	and	it	's	 know 	 ing 	 	what	your	highest	 strength 	 s 	 	are	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	there	's	a	valid	test	of	what	your	five	highest	 strength 	 s 	 	are	.
and	then	re	-	 craft 	 ing 	 	your	life	to	use	them	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	you	possibly	can	.
re	-	 craft 	 ing 	 	your	work	,	your	love	,	your	play	,	your	 friend 	 ship 	 	,	your	 parent 	 ing 	 	.
just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	one	person	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	was	a	 bag 	 ger 	 	at	genuardi	's	.
 hat 	 ed 	 	the	job	.

but	what	she	did	was	to	take	her	highest	 strength 	 s 	 	,	and	re	-	craft	work	to	use	them	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
what	you	get	out	of	that	is	not	smiley	-	ness	.
you	do	n't	look	like	debbie	reynolds	.
you	do	n't	 gig 	 gle 	 	a	lot	.	what	you	get	is	more	absorption	.
so	,	that	's	the	second	path	.	the	first	path	,	positive	emotion	.
the	second	path	is	 eudaimonia 	 n 	 	flow	.
and	the	third	path	is	meaning	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 vene 	 r 	 able 	 	of	the	 happiness 	 es 	 	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	.
and	meaning	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	view	,	 consist 	 s 	 	of	--	 ver 	 y 	 	parallel	to	eudaimonia	--	it	 consist 	 s 	 	of	 know 	 ing 	 	what	your	highest	 strength 	 s 	 	are	,	and	using	them	to	belong	to	and	in	the	service	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 large 	 r 	 	than	you	are	.
i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	that	for	all	three	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	,	the	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	,	the	good	life	,	the	 meaning 	 ful 	 	life	,	people	are	now	hard	at	work	on	the	question	,	are	there	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 last 	 ing 	 ly 	 	change	 t 	 hose 	 	 live 	 s 	 	?
and	the	answer	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 y 	 es 	 	.	and	i	'll	just	give	you	some	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	it	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	a	 rigor 	 ous 	 	manner	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	same	way	that	we	test	 drug 	 s 	 	to	see	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	we	do	random	 assign 	 ment 	 	,	 place 	 bo 	 	controlled	,	long	-	term	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	different	 intervention 	 s 	 	.
and	just	to	 s 	 ample 	 	the	kind	of	 intervention 	 s 	 	that	we	find	have	an	effect	,	when	we	teach	people	about	the	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	,	how	to	have	more	pleasure	in	your	life	,	one	of	your	 assign 	 ments 	 	is	to	take	the	 mind 	 fulness 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,	the	 savor 	 ing 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	you	're	 assign 	 ed 	 	to	design	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	day	.
next	saturday	,	set	a	day	 a 	 side 	 	,	design	 your 	 self 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	day	,	and	use	 savor 	 ing 	 	and	 mind 	 fulness 	 	to	enhance	 t 	 hose 	 	 pleasure 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	show	in	that	way	that	the	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	is	 enhance 	 d 	 	.
 grat 	 itude 	 	visit	.	i	want	you	all	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	me	now	,	if	you	would	.
close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	like	you	to	remember	 some 	 one 	 	who	did	 some 	 thing 	 	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	 change 	 d 	 	your	life	in	a	good	direction	,	and	who	you	never	 proper 	 ly 	 	 thank 	 ed 	 	.
the	person	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	.	ok	.
now	,	ok	,	you	can	open	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
i	hope	all	of	you	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	person	.
your	 assign 	 ment 	 	,	when	you	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	the	 grat 	 itude 	 	visit	,	is	to	write	a	300	-	word	testimonial	to	that	person	,	call	them	on	the	phone	in	phoenix	,	ask	if	you	can	visit	,	do	n't	tell	them	why	,	show	up	at	 the 	 ir 	 	door	,	you	read	the	testimonial	--	 every 	 one 	 	 weep 	 s 	 	when	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	when	we	test	people	one	week	 lat 	 er 	 	,	a	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	three	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	they	're	both	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	and	less	 depress 	 ed 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	a	strength	date	,	in	which	we	get	 couple 	 s 	 	to	identify	 the 	 ir 	 	highest	 strength 	 s 	 	on	the	 strength 	 s 	 	test	,	and	then	to	design	an	 even 	 ing 	 	in	which	they	both	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 strength 	 s 	 	,	and	we	find	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 strength 	 en 	 er 	 	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
and	 f 	 un 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
but	it	's	so	 heart 	 en 	 ing 	 	to	be	in	a	group	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	which	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 turn 	 ed 	 	your	 live 	 s 	 	to	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
well	,	my	 under 	 graduate 	 s 	 	and	the	people	i	work	with	have	n't	 discover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	people	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 altruist 	 ic 	 	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	to	contrast	it	.
and	what	you	find	is	when	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 f 	 un 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	square	wave	walk	set	.
when	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	to	help	 an 	 other 	 	person	,	it	 last 	 s 	 	and	it	 last 	 s 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	positive	 intervention 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	next	to	last	thing	i	want	to	say	is	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	much	life	satisfaction	people	have	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	what	you	're	about	.	and	that	's	our	target	 vari 	 able 	 	.
and	we	ask	the	question	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	the	three	different	 live 	 s 	 	,	how	much	life	satisfaction	do	you	get	?
so	we	ask	--	and	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	15	 replica 	 tions 	 	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	--	to	what	 ex 	 tent 	 	 do 	 es 	 	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	pleasure	,	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	positive	emotion	,	the	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	,	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	time	 stop 	 ping 	 	for	you	,	and	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	meaning	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	life	satisfaction	?
and	our	 result 	 s 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	us	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 back 	 ward 	 	of	what	we	thought	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	pleasure	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	no	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	life	satisfaction	.
the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	meaning	is	the	 strong 	 est 	 	.
the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	 engage 	 ment 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	.
where	pleasure	 matter 	 s 	 	is	if	you	have	both	 engage 	 ment 	 	and	you	have	meaning	,	then	pleasure	's	the	 whip 	 ped 	 	cream	and	the	 cher 	 ry 	 	.
which	is	to	say	,	the	full	life	--	the	sum	is	 great 	 er 	 	than	the	 part 	 s 	 	,	if	you	've	got	all	three	.
 con 	 verse 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	have	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	three	,	the	empty	life	,	the	sum	is	less	than	the	 part 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	now	is	 do 	 es 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	relationship	,	physical	health	,	 morbid 	 ity 	 	,	how	long	you	live	and	 product 	 ivity 	 	,	follow	the	same	relationship	?
that	is	,	in	a	corporation	,	is	 product 	 ivity 	 	a	function	of	positive	emotion	,	 engage 	 ment 	 	and	meaning	?
is	health	a	function	of	positive	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	of	pleasure	,	and	of	meaning	in	life	?
and	there	is	reason	to	think	the	answer	to	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	may	well	be	 y 	 es 	 	.
so	,	chris	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	last	speaker	had	a	chance	to	try	to	integrate	what	he	heard	,	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	for	me	.	i	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	 gather 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	 speaker 	 s 	 	stretch	beyond	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	so	much	,	which	was	one	of	the	 remark 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	i	found	that	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	parallel	to	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	design	in	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	way	.
we	all	know	that	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	design	have	 be 	 en 	 	and	can	be	used	for	 destruct 	 ive 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	design	can	be	used	to	 reliev 	 e 	 	 mis 	 ery 	 	.
and	by	the	way	,	the	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	 reliev 	 ing 	 	 mis 	 ery 	 	and	building	happiness	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	thought	,	when	i	first	 be 	 came 	 	a	therapist	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	if	i	was	good	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	 some 	 one 	 	not	 depress 	 ed 	 	,	not	 anx 	 ious 	 	,	not	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	that	i	'd	make	them	happy	.
and	i	never	found	that	.	i	found	the	best	you	could	ever	do	was	to	get	to	zero	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	empty	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	 skill 	 s 	 	of	happiness	,	the	 skill 	 s 	 	of	the	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	,	the	 skill 	 s 	 	of	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	the	 skill 	 s 	 	of	meaning	,	are	different	from	the	 skill 	 s 	 	of	 reliev 	 ing 	 	 mis 	 ery 	 	.
and	so	,	the	parallel	thing	 hold 	 s 	 	with	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	design	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.
that	is	,	it	is	possible	for	these	three	 driver 	 s 	 	of	our	world	to	 in 	 crease 	 	happiness	,	to	 in 	 crease 	 	positive	emotion	,	and	that	's	 typical 	 ly 	 	how	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	used	.
but	once	you	 fraction 	 ate 	 	happiness	the	way	i	do	--	not	just	positive	emotion	,	that	's	not	 near 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	--	there	's	flow	in	life	,	and	there	's	meaning	in	life	.
 a 	 s 	 	laura	lee	told	us	,	design	,	and	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	technology	,	can	be	used	to	 in 	 crease 	 	meaning	 engage 	 ment 	 	in	life	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	in	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	the	 eleven 	 th 	 	reason	for	 optim 	 ism 	 	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	the	space	 elev 	 ator 	 	,	is	that	i	think	with	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	design	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	the	amount	of	 ton 	 n 	 age 	 	of	human	happiness	on	the	planet	.
and	if	technology	can	,	in	the	next	decade	or	two	,	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	,	the	good	life	and	the	 meaning 	 ful 	 	life	,	it	will	be	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
if	 entertain 	 ment 	 	can	be	 divert 	 ed 	 	to	 al 	 so 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	positive	emotion	,	meaning	,	eudaimonia	,	it	will	be	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
and	if	design	can	 in 	 crease 	 	positive	emotion	,	eudaimonia	,	and	flow	and	meaning	,	what	we	're	all	 do 	 ing 	 	together	will	 be 	 come 	 	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.	thank	you	.
