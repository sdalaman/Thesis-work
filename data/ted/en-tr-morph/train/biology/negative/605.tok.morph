for	me	they	 normal 	 ly 	 	happen	,	these	 care 	 er 	 	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	,	often	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	on	a	sunday	 even 	 ing 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	set	,	and	the	gap	between	my	 hope 	 s 	 	for	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	my	life	,	start	to	diverge	so	 pain 	 fully 	 	that	i	 normal 	 ly 	 	end	up	 weep 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 pil 	 low 	 	.
i	'm	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	'm	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 mere 	 ly 	 	a	personal	problem	.
you	may	think	i	'm	wrong	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	i	think	that	we	live	in	an	age	when	our	 live 	 s 	 	are	 regular 	 ly 	 	 punctu 	 ated 	 	by	 care 	 er 	 	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	,	by	 moment 	 s 	 	when	what	we	thought	we	 k 	 new 	 	,	about	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	about	our	 care 	 ers 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	contact	with	a	 threaten 	 ing 	 	sort	of	 re 	 ality 	 	.
it	's	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	now	than	ever	before	to	make	a	good	living	.
it	's	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	than	ever	before	to	stay	calm	,	to	be	free	of	 care 	 er 	 	 anxie 	 ty 	 	.
i	want	to	look	now	,	if	i	may	,	at	some	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	might	be	 feel 	 ing 	 	 anxie 	 ty 	 	about	our	 care 	 ers 	 	.
why	we	might	be	 victim 	 s 	 	of	these	 care 	 er 	 	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 weep 	 ing 	 	 soft 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 pil 	 low 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	might	be	 suffer 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	are	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 snob 	 s 	 	.
in	a	way	,	i	've	got	some	bad	news	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	to	 any 	 body 	 	who	's	come	to	oxford	from	 a 	 broad 	 	.
there	is	a	real	problem	with	 snob 	 ber 	 y 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	from	 out 	 side 	 	the	u.k	.
imagine	that	 snob 	 ber 	 y 	 	is	a	 distinct 	 ively 	 	u.k.	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 fix 	 ated 	 	on	country	 house 	 s 	 	and	 title 	 s 	 	.
the	bad	news	is	that	's	not	true	.
 snob 	 ber 	 y 	 	is	a	global	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
we	are	a	global	 organ 	 ization 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	global	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
it	 exist 	 s 	 	.	what	is	a	snob	?
a	snob	is	 any 	 body 	 	who	 take 	 s 	 	a	small	part	of	you	and	uses	that	to	come	to	a	complete	vision	of	who	you	are	.
that	is	 snob 	 ber 	 y 	 	.
the	 domin 	 ant 	 	kind	of	 snob 	 ber 	 y 	 	that	 exist 	 s 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	is	job	 snob 	 ber 	 y 	 	.
you	 en 	 counter 	 	it	 with 	 in 	 	 minute 	 s 	 	at	a	party	,	when	you	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	that	famous	 icon 	 ic 	 	question	of	the	early	21st	century	,	``	what	do	you	do	?	``
and	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	how	you	answer	that	question	,	people	are	either	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	to	see	you	,	or	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	watch	and	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 excuse 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	a	snob	is	your	mother	.
not	 necess 	 arily 	 	your	mother	,	or	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	mine	,	but	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	the	ideal	mother	,	 some 	 body 	 	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	about	your	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	most	people	are	not	our	 mother 	 s 	 	.
most	people	make	a	strict	correlation	between	how	much	time	,	and	if	you	like	,	love	--	not	romantic	love	,	 th 	 ough 	 	that	may	be	 some 	 thing 	 	--	but	love	in	general	,	respect	,	they	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	accord	us	,	that	will	be	 strict 	 ly 	 	defined	by	our	position	in	the	social	 hierarch 	 y 	 	.
and	that	's	a	lot	of	the	reason	why	we	care	so	much	about	our	 care 	 ers 	 	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	start	 car 	 ing 	 	so	much	about	material	 good 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	we	're	often	told	that	we	live	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 material 	 istic 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	that	we	're	all	 greed 	 y 	 	people	.
i	do	n't	think	we	are	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 material 	 istic 	 	.
i	think	we	live	in	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 peg 	 ged 	 	certain	 emotion 	 al 	 	 reward 	 s 	 	to	the	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	of	material	 good 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	the	material	 good 	 s 	 	we	want	.	it	's	the	 reward 	 s 	 	we	want	.
and	that	's	a	new	way	of	looking	at	 luxur 	 y 	 	 good 	 s 	 	.
the	next	time	you	see	 some 	 body 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	a	ferrari	do	n't	think	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 body 	 	who	is	 greed 	 y 	 	.	``
think	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 body 	 	who	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	and	in	need	of	love	.	``
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	--	feel	 sympath 	 y 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 con 	 tempt 	 	.
there	are	other	 reason 	 s 	 	--	there	are	other	 reason 	 s 	 	why	it	's	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	now	to	feel	calm	than	ever	before	.
one	of	these	,	and	it	's	 paradox 	 ical 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	linked	to	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 ra 	 ther 	 	nice	,	is	the	hope	we	all	have	for	our	 care 	 ers 	 	.
never	before	have	 expect 	 ations 	 	 be 	 en 	 	so	high	about	what	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 span 	 	.
we	're	told	,	from	 man 	 y 	 	 source 	 s 	 	,	that	 any 	 one 	 	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	away	with	the	 cast 	 e 	 	system	.
we	are	now	in	a	system	where	 any 	 one 	 	can	rise	to	any	position	they	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	idea	.
 a 	 long 	 	with	that	is	a	kind	of	spirit	of	 e 	 quality 	 	.	we	're	all	 bas 	 ically 	 	equal	.
there	are	no	 strict 	 ly 	 	defined	kind	of	 hierarch 	 ies 	 	.
there	is	one	 re 	 ally 	 	big	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	that	problem	is	 en 	 vy 	 	.
 en 	 vy 	 	,	it	's	a	real	taboo	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	 en 	 vy 	 	,	but	if	there	is	one	 domin 	 ant 	 	emotion	in	modern	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	that	is	 en 	 vy 	 	.
and	it	's	linked	to	the	spirit	of	 e 	 quality 	 	.	let	me	explain	.
i	think	it	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	here	,	or	 any 	 one 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	to	be	 en 	 vi 	 ous 	 	of	the	 que 	 en 	 	of	england	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	she	is	much	 rich 	 er 	 	than	any	of	you	are	.
and	she	's	got	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	house	.
the	reason	why	we	do	n't	 en 	 vy 	 	her	is	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	too	weird	.
she	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	too	strange	.
we	ca	n't	 re 	 late 	 	to	her	.	she	 speak 	 s 	 	in	a	funny	way	.
she	 come 	 s 	 	from	an	odd	place	.
so	we	ca	n't	 re 	 late 	 	to	her	.	and	when	you	ca	n't	 re 	 late 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	,	you	do	n't	 en 	 vy 	 	them	.
the	 close 	 r 	 	two	people	are	,	in	age	,	in	 back 	 ground 	 	,	in	the	process	of	 ident 	 ification 	 	,	the	more	there	is	a	danger	of	 en 	 vy 	 	--	which	is	 incident 	 ally 	 	why	 non 	 e 	 	of	you	should	ever	go	to	a	school	 re 	 un 	 ion 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	no	 strong 	 er 	 	 re 	 ference 	 	point	than	people	one	was	at	school	with	.
but	the	problem	,	 general 	 ly 	 	,	of	modern	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	is	that	it	 turn 	 s 	 	the	whole	world	 in 	 to 	 	a	school	.	 every 	 body 	 	is	 wear 	 ing 	 	 jean 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	is	the	same	.
and	yet	,	they	're	not	.
so	there	is	a	spirit	of	 e 	 quality 	 	,	 combine 	 d 	 	with	deep	 in 	 equal 	 ities 	 	.
which	 make 	 s 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	--	can	make	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 stress 	 ful 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	that	you	would	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 a 	 s 	 	rich	and	famous	 a 	 s 	 	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	in	the	17th	century	that	you	would	 ac 	 cede 	 	to	the	 rank 	 s 	 	of	the	french	 aristoc 	 racy 	 	.
but	the	point	is	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	feel	that	way	.
it	's	made	to	feel	,	by	 magazine 	 s 	 	and	other	media	 out 	 lets 	 	,	that	if	you	've	got	energy	,	a	few	bright	 idea 	 s 	 	about	technology	,	a	 gar 	 age 	 	,	you	too	could	start	a	major	thing	.
and	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	problem	make	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	felt	in	 book 	 shop 	 s 	 	.
when	you	go	to	a	large	 book 	 shop 	 	and	look	at	the	self	-	help	 section 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	do	,	if	you	 analyz 	 e 	 	self	-	help	 book 	 s 	 	that	are	 produce 	 d 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	,	there	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	two	 kind 	 s 	 	.
the	first	kind	 tell 	 s 	 	you	,	``	you	can	do	it	!	you	can	make	it	!	 any 	 thing 	 	is	possible	!	``
and	the	other	kind	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	to	cope	with	what	we	 polite 	 ly 	 	call	``	low	self	-	esteem	,	``	or	 im 	 polite 	 ly 	 	call	``	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	about	 your 	 self 	 	.	``
there	is	a	real	 correlation 	 ship 	 	,	a	real	correlation	between	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	people	that	they	can	do	 any 	 thing 	 	and	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	low	self	-	esteem	.
so	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	way	in	which	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 quit 	 e 	 	positive	can	have	a	nasty	 kick 	 back 	 	.
there	is	 an 	 other 	 	reason	why	we	might	be	 feel 	 ing 	 	more	 anx 	 ious 	 	,	about	our	 care 	 ers 	 	,	about	our	 stat 	 us 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	,	than	ever	before	.
and	it	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	linked	to	 some 	 thing 	 	nice	,	and	that	nice	thing	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 merit 	 o 	 cracy 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	,	all	 politic 	 ians 	 	on	left	and	right	,	agree	that	 merit 	 o 	 cracy 	 	is	a	great	thing	,	and	we	should	all	be	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 meritocrat 	 ic 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	what	is	a	 meritocrat 	 ic 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
a	 meritocrat 	 ic 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	one	in	which	if	you	've	got	talent	and	energy	and	skill	,	you	will	get	to	the	top	.	 noth 	 ing 	 	should	hold	you	back	.
it	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	idea	.	the	problem	is	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	where	 t 	 hose 	 	who	merit	to	get	to	the	top	,	get	to	the	top	,	you	'll	 al 	 so 	 	,	by	 implic 	 ation 	 	,	and	in	a	far	more	nasty	way	,	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	where	 t 	 hose 	 	who	deserve	to	get	to	the	bottom	 al 	 so 	 	get	to	the	bottom	and	stay	there	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	your	position	in	life	 come 	 s 	 	to	seem	not	 accident 	 al 	 	,	but	 merit 	 ed 	 	and	 deserve 	 d 	 	.
and	that	 make 	 s 	 	failure	seem	much	more	 crush 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	in	the	middle	 age 	 s 	 	,	in	england	,	when	you	met	a	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	person	,	that	person	would	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	``	 un 	 fortunate 	 	``	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 some 	 body 	 	who	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	 bless 	 ed 	 	by	fortune	,	an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	.
 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	if	you	meet	 some 	 one 	 	at	the	bottom	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	they	may	 un 	 kind 	 ly 	 	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	``	 lose 	 r 	 	.	``
there	is	a	real	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	and	a	 lose 	 r 	 	,	and	that	 show 	 s 	 	400	 year 	 s 	 	of	evolution	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	our	belief	in	who	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
it	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	 god 	 s 	 	,	it	's	us	.	we	're	in	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	seat	.
that	's	 exhila 	 rating 	 	if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	well	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 crush 	 ing 	 	if	you	're	not	.
it	 lead 	 s 	 	,	in	the	worst	 case 	 s 	 	,	in	the	analysis	of	a	 socio 	 logist 	 	like	emil	durkheim	,	it	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	rates	of	 su 	 icide 	 	.
there	are	more	 sui 	 cides 	 	in	 develop 	 ed 	 	 individual 	 istic 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	than	in	any	other	part	of	the	world	.
and	some	of	the	reason	for	that	is	that	people	take	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	them	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 personal 	 ly 	 	.
they	own	 the 	 ir 	 	success	.	but	they	 al 	 so 	 	own	 the 	 ir 	 	failure	.
is	there	any	relief	from	some	of	these	 pressure 	 s 	 	that	i	've	just	 be 	 en 	 	 out 	 lining 	 	?
i	think	there	is	.	i	just	want	to	turn	to	a	few	of	them	.
let	's	take	 merit 	 o 	 cracy 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	 every 	 body 	 	 deserve 	 s 	 	to	get	where	they	get	to	,	i	think	it	's	a	crazy	idea	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	crazy	.
i	will	support	any	 politic 	 ian 	 	of	left	and	right	,	with	any	 half 	 way 	 	 de 	 cent 	 	 meritocrat 	 ic 	 	idea	.
i	am	a	meritocrat	in	that	sense	.
but	i	think	it	's	 insan 	 e 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	will	ever	make	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	is	 genuine 	 ly 	 	 meritocrat 	 ic 	 	.	it	's	an	 im 	 possible 	 	dream	.
the	idea	that	we	will	make	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	where	 liter 	 ally 	 	 every 	 body 	 	is	 grad 	 ed 	 	,	the	good	at	the	top	,	and	the	bad	at	the	bottom	,	and	it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	should	be	,	is	 im 	 possible 	 	.
there	are	 simpl 	 y 	 	too	 man 	 y 	 	random	 factor 	 s 	 	:	 accident 	 s 	 	,	 accident 	 s 	 	of	birth	,	 accident 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	dropping	on	people	's	 head 	 s 	 	,	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	,	etc	.
we	will	never	get	to	grade	them	,	never	get	to	grade	people	 a 	 s 	 	they	should	.
i	'm	drawn	to	a	 love 	 ly 	 	quote	by	st.	augustine	in	``	the	city	of	god	,	``	where	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	it	's	a	 s 	 in 	 	to	 judg 	 e 	 	any	man	by	his	post	.	``
in	modern	english	that	would	mean	it	's	a	 s 	 in 	 	to	come	to	any	view	of	who	you	should	talk	to	dependent	on	 the 	 ir 	 	business	card	.
it	's	not	the	post	that	should	count	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	st.	augustine	,	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	god	who	can	 re 	 ally 	 	put	 every 	 body 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	place	.
and	he	's	going	to	do	that	on	the	day	of	judgment	with	 angel 	 s 	 	and	 trump 	 et 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 ski 	 es 	 	will	open	.
 insan 	 e 	 	idea	,	if	you	're	a	 secular 	 ist 	 	person	,	like	me	.
but	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	in	that	idea	,	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	hold	your	 horse 	 s 	 	when	you	're	coming	to	 judg 	 e 	 	people	.
you	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	know	what	 some 	 one 	 	's	true	value	is	.
that	is	an	 un 	 known 	 	part	of	them	.
and	we	should	n't	 behav 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	is	known	.
there	is	 an 	 other 	 	source	of	 so 	 lace 	 	and	comfort	for	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
when	we	think	about	 fail 	 ing 	 	in	life	,	when	we	think	about	failure	,	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	fear	 fail 	 ing 	 	is	not	just	a	loss	of	income	,	a	loss	of	 stat 	 us 	 	.
what	we	fear	is	the	judgment	and	 ridicul 	 e 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	.	and	it	 exist 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	the	number	one	organ	of	 ridicul 	 e 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	is	the	 news 	 paper 	 	.
and	if	you	open	the	 news 	 paper 	 	any	day	of	the	week	,	it	's	full	of	people	who	've	 mess 	 ed 	 	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
they	've	slept	with	the	wrong	person	.	they	've	taken	the	wrong	 sub 	 stance 	 	.
they	've	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	wrong	piece	of	 legisl 	 ation 	 	.	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
and	then	are	fit	for	 ridicul 	 e 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	they	have	 fail 	 ed 	 	.	and	they	are	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	 lose 	 rs 	 	.	``
now	is	there	any	 alter 	 native 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	?
i	think	the	western	tradition	 show 	 s 	 	us	one	 glor 	 ious 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	,	and	that	is	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
tragic	art	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	the	 theater 	 s 	 	of	ancient	greece	,	in	the	fifth	century	b.c	.	,	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	an	art	form	 devote 	 d 	 	to	 trac 	 ing 	 	how	people	fail	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	them	a	level	of	 sympath 	 y 	 	,	which	 ordin 	 ary 	 	life	would	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	accord	them	.
i	remember	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	went	to	see	``	the	sunday	 s 	 port 	 	,	``	a	tabloid	 news 	 paper 	 	that	i	do	n't	recommend	you	to	start	 read 	 ing 	 	if	you	're	not	familiar	with	it	 al 	 ready 	 	.
i	went	to	talk	to	them	about	certain	of	the	great	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	of	western	art	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	how	they	would	 s 	 e 	 ize 	 	the	bare	 bone 	 s 	 	of	certain	 st 	 ories 	 	if	they	came	in	 a 	 s 	 	a	news	item	at	the	news	desk	on	a	saturday	afternoon	.
so	i	told	them	about	othello	.	they	had	not	heard	of	it	but	 we 	 re 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	it	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	write	the	 head 	 line 	 	for	the	story	of	othello	.
they	came	up	with	``	love	-	 craze 	 d 	 	 im 	 migrant 	 	 kill 	 s 	 	senator	's	daughter	``	 splash 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 head 	 line 	 	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	them	the	 plot 	 line 	 	of	madame	bovary	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	book	they	 we 	 re 	 	 enchant 	 ed 	 	to	discover	.
and	they	wrote	``	shopaholic	adulteress	 swallow 	 s 	 	arsenic	after	credit	fraud	.	``
and	then	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	do	have	a	kind	of	 gen 	 ius 	 	all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
my	 favor 	 ite 	 	is	sophocles	'	oedipus	the	king	:	``	 s 	 ex 	 	with	mum	was	 blind 	 ing 	 	``	in	a	way	,	if	you	like	,	at	one	end	of	the	spectrum	of	 sympath 	 y 	 	,	you	've	got	the	tabloid	 news 	 paper 	 	.
at	the	other	end	of	the	spectrum	you	've	got	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	and	tragic	art	,	and	i	suppose	i	'm	 argu 	 ing 	 	that	we	should	learn	a	little	bit	about	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	tragic	art	.
it	would	be	 insan 	 e 	 	to	call	 ham 	 let 	 	a	 lose 	 r 	 	.
he	is	not	a	 lose 	 r 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	he	 ha 	 s 	 	lost	.
and	i	think	that	is	the	 mess 	 age 	 	of	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	to	us	,	and	why	it	's	so	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	i	think	.
the	other	thing	about	modern	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	why	it	 cause 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 anxie 	 ty 	 	is	that	we	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	at	 it 	 s 	 	center	that	is	non	-	human	.
we	are	the	first	 socie 	 ty 	 	to	be	living	in	a	world	where	we	do	n't	worship	 any 	 thing 	 	other	than	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	think	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	so	we	should	.
we	've	put	people	on	the	moon	.	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	tend	to	worship	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
our	heroes	are	human	heroes	.
that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	new	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
most	other	 socie 	 ties 	 	have	had	,	right	at	 the 	 ir 	 	center	,	the	worship	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 transcend 	 ent 	 	:	a	god	,	a	spirit	,	a	natural	force	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 worship 	 ed 	 	.
we	've	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	lost	the	habit	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	which	is	,	i	think	,	why	we	're	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	drawn	to	nature	.
not	for	the	sake	of	our	health	,	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	often	 present 	 ed 	 	that	way	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	 es 	 cape 	 	from	the	human	 ant 	 hill 	 	.
it	's	an	 es 	 cape 	 	from	our	own	 com 	 petition 	 	,	and	our	own	 drama 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	why	we	enjoy	looking	at	 glaci 	 ers 	 	and	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	and	 contempl 	 ating 	 	the	earth	from	 out 	 side 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 peri 	 meter 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
we	like	to	feel	in	contact	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	non	-	human	,	and	that	is	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	.
what	i	think	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 re 	 ally 	 	is	success	and	failure	.
and	one	of	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	success	is	that	we	think	we	know	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	.
if	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	you	that	there	is	 some 	 body 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	screen	who	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,	certain	 idea 	 s 	 	would	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	come	to	mind	.
you	would	think	that	person	might	have	made	a	lot	of	money	,	 achiev 	 ed 	 	 ren 	 own 	 	in	some	field	.
my	own	 theor 	 y 	 	of	success	--	and	i	'm	 some 	 body 	 	who	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	success	.	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	.
i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	how	could	i	be	more	 success 	 ful 	 	?	``
but	 a 	 s 	 	i	get	 old 	 er 	 	,	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 nuance 	 d 	 	about	what	that	word	``	success	``	might	mean	.
here	's	an	 in 	 sight 	 	that	i	've	had	about	success	.
you	ca	n't	be	 success 	 ful 	 	at	 every 	 thing 	 	.
we	hear	a	lot	of	talk	about	work	-	life	balance	.
 non 	 sense 	 	.	you	ca	n't	have	it	all	.	you	ca	n't	.
so	any	vision	of	success	 ha 	 s 	 	to	admit	what	it	's	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	out	on	,	where	the	element	of	loss	is	.
i	think	any	wise	life	will	accept	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	that	there	is	going	to	be	an	element	where	we	are	not	 succeed 	 ing 	 	.
thing	about	a	 success 	 ful 	 	life	is	,	a	lot	of	the	time	,	our	 idea 	 s 	 	of	what	it	would	mean	to	live	 success 	 fully 	 	are	not	our	own	.
they	are	 suck 	 ed 	 	in	from	other	people	:	 chief 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	're	a	man	,	your	father	,	and	if	you	're	a	woman	,	your	mother	.
psychoanalysis	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 drum 	 ming 	 	home	 th 	 is 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	for	about	80	 year 	 s 	 	.
no	one	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	hard	 en 	 ough 	 	,	but	i	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 believ 	 e 	 	that	that	's	true	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	suck	in	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	from	 every 	 thing 	 	from	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	to	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	to	 market 	 ing 	 	,	etc	.
these	are	 huge 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 force 	 s 	 	that	define	what	we	want	and	how	we	view	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
when	we	're	told	that	 bank 	 ing 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 respect 	 able 	 	profession	a	lot	of	us	want	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	.
when	 bank 	 ing 	 	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	so	 respect 	 able 	 	,	we	lose	interest	in	 bank 	 ing 	 	.
we	are	 high 	 ly 	 	open	to	 suggest 	 ion 	 	.
so	what	i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	for	is	not	that	we	should	give	up	on	our	 idea 	 s 	 	of	success	,	but	we	should	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	are	our	own	.
we	should	focus	in	on	our	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	own	them	,	that	we	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	the	 author 	 s 	 	of	our	own	 ambit 	 ions 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	bad	 en 	 ough 	 	,	not	 get 	 ting 	 	what	you	want	,	but	it	's	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	to	have	an	idea	of	what	it	is	you	want	and	find	out	at	the	end	of	a	journey	,	that	it	is	n't	,	in	fact	,	what	you	 want 	 ed 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	end	it	there	.
but	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	stress	is	by	all	 mean 	 s 	 	,	success	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
but	let	's	accept	the	 strange 	 ness 	 	of	some	of	our	 idea 	 s 	 	.
let	's	 prob 	 e 	 	away	at	our	 not 	 ions 	 	of	success	.
let	's	make	 s 	 ure 	 	our	 idea 	 s 	 	of	success	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	our	own	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	that	was	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.	how	do	you	reconcile	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 some 	 one 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	--	it	 be 	 ing 	 	bad	to	think	of	 some 	 one 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 lose 	 r 	 	with	the	idea	,	that	a	lot	of	people	like	,	of	 s 	 e 	 izing 	 	control	of	your	life	.
and	that	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	 encourag 	 es 	 	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	some	 winner 	 s 	 	and	 lose 	 rs 	 	.
alain	de	botton	:	 y 	 es 	 	.	i	think	it	's	 mere 	 ly 	 	the	 random 	 ness 	 	of	the	winning	and	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	process	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	stress	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 emphas 	 is 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	is	so	much	on	the	justice	of	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	 politic 	 ians 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	talk	about	justice	.
now	i	am	a	firm	 believ 	 er 	 	in	justice	,	i	just	think	that	it	is	 im 	 possible 	 	.
so	we	should	do	 every 	 thing 	 	we	can	,	we	should	do	 every 	 thing 	 	we	can	to	pursue	it	.
but	at	the	end	of	the	day	we	should	 al 	 ways 	 	remember	that	 who 	 ever 	 	is	facing	us	,	 what 	 ever 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	there	will	be	a	strong	element	of	the	 hap 	 hazard 	 	.
and	it	's	that	that	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	room	for	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	it	can	get	 quit 	 e 	 	 clau 	 stro 	 phobic 	 	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	do	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	you	can	combine	your	kind	of	 kind 	 er 	 	,	 gentle 	 r 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	of	work	with	a	 success 	 ful 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	?
or	do	you	think	that	you	ca	n't	?
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	that	much	that	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	too	much	 emphas 	 is 	 	on	that	?
ab	:	the	nightmare	thought	is	that	 frighten 	 ing 	 	people	is	the	best	way	to	get	work	out	of	them	,	and	that	 some 	 how 	 	the	 cruel 	 er 	 	the	environment	the	more	people	will	rise	to	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
you	want	to	think	,	who	would	you	like	 a 	 s 	 	your	ideal	dad	?
and	your	ideal	dad	is	 some 	 body 	 	who	is	tough	but	gentle	.
and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	line	to	make	.
we	need	 father 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	the	 exempl 	 ary 	 	father	 figure 	 s 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 avoid 	 ing 	 	the	two	 extrem 	 es 	 	,	which	is	the	 author 	 itarian 	 	,	disciplinarian	,	on	the	one	hand	,	and	on	the	other	,	the	lax	,	no	 rule 	 s 	 	option	.
