a	talk	about	 sur 	 gical 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	talk	about	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
and	while	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	my	 image 	 s 	 	not	too	graphic	,	keep	in	mind	that	 surgeon 	 s 	 	have	a	different	relationship	with	blood	than	normal	people	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	after	all	,	what	a	surgeon	 do 	 es 	 	to	a	patient	,	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 with 	 out 	 	consent	,	would	be	a	 felon 	 y 	 	.
 surgeon 	 s 	 	are	the	 tailor 	 s 	 	,	the	 plumb 	 ers 	 	,	the	 carp 	 enter 	 s 	 	--	some	would	say	the	 butcher 	 s 	 	--	of	the	medical	world	:	cutting	,	 re 	 sha 	 ping 	 	,	 reform 	 ing 	 	,	 bypass 	 ing 	 	,	 fix 	 ing 	 	.
but	you	need	to	talk	about	 sur 	 gical 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	and	the	evolution	of	 sur 	 gical 	 	technology	together	.
so	in	order	to	give	you	some	kind	of	a	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	where	we	are	right	now	with	 sur 	 gical 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	,	and	where	we	're	going	to	be	going	in	the	future	,	i	want	to	give	you	a	little	bit	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	how	we	got	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	how	we	even	came	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	was	ok	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	possible	to	do	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	cutting	and	 reform 	 ing 	 	was	ok	.
so	,	a	little	bit	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	--	about	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 trephi 	 nated 	 	skull	.
and	 trephi 	 nation 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	just	cutting	a	hole	in	the	skull	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 skull 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	found	in	 archaeo 	 logical 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	all	over	the	world	,	 d 	 ating 	 	back	five	to	10	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	.
five	to	10	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	!	now	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	are	a	 heal 	 er 	 	in	a	stone	age	village	.
and	you	have	some	guy	that	you	're	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	what	's	wrong	with	him	--	oliver	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	is	going	to	be	born	way	in	the	future	.
he	's	got	some	seizure	 dis 	 order 	 	.	and	you	do	n't	understand	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	you	think	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	i	'm	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	what	's	wrong	with	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	if	i	cut	a	hole	in	his	head	i	can	fix	it	.	``
now	that	is	 sur 	 gical 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
now	we	've	got	the	dawn	of	 intervention 	 al 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	here	.
what	is	 astonish 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	do	n't	know	 re 	 ally 	 	how	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	was	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	be	religious	,	or	how	much	of	it	was	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	be	therapeutic	,	what	we	can	tell	is	that	these	 patient 	 s 	 	lived	!
 judg 	 ing 	 	by	the	 heal 	 ing 	 	on	the	 border 	 s 	 	of	these	 hole 	 s 	 	,	they	lived	 day 	 s 	 	,	 month 	 s 	 	,	 year 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	 trephi 	 nation 	 	.
and	so	what	we	are	 see 	 ing 	 	is	evidence	of	a	 refine 	 d 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	that	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 hand 	 ed 	 	down	over	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	all	over	the	world	.

we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 see 	 ing 	 	the	dawn	of	 intervention 	 al 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
now	we	can	fast	forward	 man 	 y 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bron 	 ze 	 	age	and	beyond	.
and	we	see	new	 refine 	 d 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	coming	out	.
but	 surgeon 	 s 	 	in	these	 era 	 s 	 	are	a	little	bit	more	 conserv 	 ative 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	bold	,	 trephi 	 nating 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	.

they	 we 	 re 	 	still	a	 mis 	 trust 	 ed 	 	lot	.
 surgeon 	 s 	 	still	had	a	bit	of	a	pr	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	was	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	the	 itiner 	 ant 	 	 barb 	 er 	 	surgeon	.

i	mean	who	would	put	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	through	that	?
 un 	 til 	 	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	,	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 sens 	 ation 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	was	 tru 	 ly 	 	a	revolution	in	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
but	there	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
after	these	 ver 	 y 	 	long	,	 pain 	 s 	 taking 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	,	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	cure	 thing 	 s 	 	they	'd	never	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	touch	before	,	the	 patient 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	.
they	 di 	 ed 	 	of	massive	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	did	n't	hurt	 any 	 more 	 	,	but	it	 kill 	 ed 	 	you	 pre 	 tty 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	 infect 	 ion 	 	would	 continu 	 e 	 	to	claim	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 sur 	 gical 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	next	big	revolution	in	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	which	was	 a 	 septic 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	.
joseph	lister	was	aepsis	's	,	or	 steril 	 ity 	 	's	,	 big 	 gest 	 	 advoc 	 ate 	 	,	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 skeptic 	 al 	 	bunch	of	 surgeon 	 s 	 	.
but	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	they	did	come	around	.
the	mayo	 brother 	 s 	 	came	out	to	visit	lister	in	europe	.
and	they	came	back	to	 the 	 ir 	 	american	clinic	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	it	was	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	wash	your	 hand 	 s 	 	before	 do 	 ing 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	to	wash	up	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	so	simple	.
and	yet	,	operative	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	.
these	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	now	 be 	 ing 	 	effective	.
with	the	patient	 in 	 sensitive 	 	to	pain	,	and	a	 steril 	 e 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	field	all	 bet 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	off	,	the	sky	was	the	limit	.
you	could	now	start	 do 	 ing 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	on	the	gut	,	on	the	liver	,	on	the	heart	,	on	the	brain	.
 transplant 	 ation 	 	:	you	could	take	an	organ	out	of	one	person	,	you	could	put	it	in	 an 	 other 	 	person	,	and	it	would	work	.
 surgeon 	 s 	 	did	n't	have	a	problem	with	 respect 	 ability 	 	 any 	 more 	 	;	they	had	 be 	 come 	 	 god 	 s 	 	.
the	era	of	the	``	big	surgeon	,	big	incision	``	had	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	but	at	 quit 	 e 	 	a	cost	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	saving	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	quality	of	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 health 	 y 	 	people	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	need	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	and	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	people	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	time	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	from	a	cut	like	that	.
the	question	had	to	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	well	,	can	we	do	these	same	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	but	through	little	 incision 	 s 	 	?	``
 lap 	 a 	 roscopy 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	:	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	with	long	 instrument 	 s 	 	through	small	 incision 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
some	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	it	had	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	1980s	,	when	there	was	 change 	 s 	 	in	camera	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	for	real	 operation 	 s 	 	.
so	what	you	see	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	the	first	 sur 	 gical 	 	image	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	coming	down	the	tube	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	entry	 in 	 to 	 	the	body	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	what	you	're	 expect 	 ing 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	to	look	like	.
we	 br 	 ing 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	in	,	from	two	 separat 	 e 	 	 cut 	 s 	 	in	the	side	,	and	then	you	can	start	 manipul 	 ating 	 	tissue	.
 with 	 in 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	the	first	 gall 	 bladder 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 laparoscopic 	 ally 	 	,	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 gall 	 bladder 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 laparoscopic 	 ally 	 	--	 tru 	 ly 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	revolution	.
but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 casual 	 ties 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	revolution	.
these	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	 hard 	 er 	 	to	learn	than	people	had	 anticip 	 ated 	 	.
the	 learn 	 ing 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	 learn 	 ing 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	the	 complic 	 ations 	 	went	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	 high 	 er 	 	.
 surgeon 	 s 	 	had	to	give	up	 the 	 ir 	 	3d	vision	.
they	had	to	give	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 wrist 	 s 	 	.
they	had	to	give	up	intuitive	motion	in	the	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	surgeon	 ha 	 s 	 	over	3,000	 hour 	 s 	 	of	laparoscopic	experience	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	placement	of	the	needle	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	hard	.
and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	it	is	so	hard	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	external	 er 	 gon 	 omics 	 	are	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
you	've	got	these	long	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	and	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	off	your	 center 	 line 	 	.
and	the	 instrument 	 s 	 	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
so	what	you	need	to	do	,	to	take	the	 cap 	 ability 	 	of	your	hand	,	and	put	it	on	the	other	side	of	that	small	incision	,	is	you	need	to	put	a	wrist	on	that	instrument	.
and	so	--	i	get	to	talk	about	 robot 	 s 	 	--	the	da	vinci	robot	put	just	that	wrist	on	the	other	side	of	that	incision	.
and	so	here	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	operation	of	 th 	 is 	 	wrist	.
and	now	,	in	contrast	to	the	 lap 	 a 	 roscopy 	 	,	you	can	 precise 	 ly 	 	place	the	needle	in	your	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	pass	it	all	the	way	through	and	follow	it	in	a	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	.
and	the	reason	why	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	so	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	is	--	you	can	see	on	the	bottom	--	the	 hand 	 s 	 	are	making	the	 motion 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 instrument 	 s 	 	are	 follow 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 motion 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
now	,	what	you	put	between	 t 	 hose 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	is	a	large	,	 fair 	 ly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	robot	.
the	surgeon	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	a	 consol 	 e 	 	,	and	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	robot	with	these	 controll 	 ers 	 	.
and	the	robot	is	moving	these	 instrument 	 s 	 	around	,	and	 power 	 ing 	 	them	,	down	 in 	 side 	 	the	body	.
you	have	a	3d	camera	,	so	you	get	a	3d	view	.
and	since	 th 	 is 	 	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	in	1999	,	a	lot	of	these	 robot 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	out	and	 be 	 ing 	 	used	for	 sur 	 gical 	 	 procedure 	 s 	 	like	a	 pro 	 stat 	 ectomy 	 	,	which	is	a	 pro 	 state 	 	deep	in	the	 pel 	 vis 	 	,	and	it	 requir 	 es 	 	fine	 dis 	 section 	 	and	 delic 	 ate 	 	 manipul 	 ation 	 	to	be	able	to	get	a	good	 sur 	 gical 	 	 out 	 come 	 	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	sew	bypass	 vessel 	 s 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	onto	a	 beat 	 ing 	 	heart	 with 	 out 	 	 crack 	 ing 	 	the	chest	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 d 	 one 	 	in	between	the	 rib 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	go	 in 	 side 	 	the	heart	 it 	 self 	 	and	repair	the	 val 	 ves 	 	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
you	've	got	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	--	thank	you	--	and	so	you	might	say	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	!
so	,	 smart 	 y 	 pants 	 	,	why	is	n't	all	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	?	``
and	there	are	some	 reason 	 s 	 	,	some	good	 reason 	 s 	 	.
and	cost	is	one	of	them	.
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	large	,	 complic 	 ated 	 	robot	.
with	all	 it 	 s 	 	 bell 	 s 	 	and	 whistl 	 es 	 	,	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	will	cost	you	about	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	a	solid	gold	surgeon	.
more	 use 	 ful 	 	than	a	solid	gold	surgeon	,	but	,	still	,	it	's	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	big	capital	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
but	once	you	've	got	it	,	your	procedure	 cost 	 s 	 	do	come	down	.
but	there	are	other	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	.
so	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	 pro 	 stat 	 ectomy 	 	--	the	 pro 	 state 	 	is	small	,	and	it	's	in	one	spot	,	and	you	can	set	your	robot	up	 ver 	 y 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	to	work	in	that	one	spot	.
and	so	it	's	perfect	for	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
and	in	fact	if	you	,	or	 any 	 one 	 	you	know	,	had	 the 	 ir 	 	 pro 	 state 	 	taken	out	in	the	last	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 chance 	 s 	 	are	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	with	one	of	these	 system 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	need	to	reach	more	 place 	 s 	 	than	just	one	,	you	need	to	move	the	robot	.
and	you	need	to	put	some	new	 incision 	 s 	 	in	there	.
and	you	need	to	re	-	set	it	up	.
and	then	you	need	to	add	some	more	 port 	 s 	 	,	and	more	.
and	the	problem	is	it	 get 	 s 	 	time	-	 consum 	 ing 	 	,	and	 cum 	 ber 	 some 	 	.
and	for	that	reason	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	that	just	are	n't	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	with	the	da	vinci	.
so	we	had	to	ask	the	question	,	``	well	how	do	we	fix	that	?	``
what	if	we	could	change	it	so	that	we	did	n't	have	to	re	-	set	up	each	time	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	move	 some 	 where 	 	different	?
what	if	we	could	 br 	 ing 	 	all	the	 instrument 	 s 	 	in	together	in	one	place	?
how	would	that	change	the	 cap 	 abilities 	 	of	the	surgeon	?
and	how	would	that	change	the	experience	for	the	patient	?
now	,	to	do	that	,	we	need	to	be	able	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	camera	and	 instrument 	 s 	 	in	together	through	one	small	tube	,	like	that	tube	you	saw	in	the	 lap 	 a 	 roscopy 	 	video	.
or	,	not	so	 co 	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	like	a	tube	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	what	's	going	to	come	out	of	that	tube	is	the	debut	of	 th 	 is 	 	new	technology	,	 th 	 is 	 	new	robot	that	is	going	to	be	able	to	reach	 any 	 where 	 	.
ready	?	so	here	it	 come 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	camera	,	and	three	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	it	come	out	,	in	order	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	,	it	ca	n't	all	stay	 cluster 	 ed 	 	up	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	come	off	of	the	 center 	 line 	 	and	then	be	able	to	work	back	 to 	 ward 	 	that	 center 	 line 	 	.
he	's	a	 cheek 	 y 	 	little	devil	.
but	what	 th 	 is 	 	lets	you	do	is	 give 	 s 	 	you	that	all	-	 import 	 ant 	 	 tract 	 ion 	 	,	and	counter	-	 tract 	 ion 	 	,	so	that	you	can	dissect	,	so	that	you	can	sew	,	so	that	you	can	do	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	need	to	do	,	all	the	 sur 	 gical 	 	 task 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	all	coming	in	through	one	incision	.
it	's	not	so	simple	.
but	it	's	worth	it	for	the	 free 	 dom 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	going	around	.
for	the	patient	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	it	's	 trans 	 parent 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	they	're	going	to	see	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	think	where	we	get	to	go	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	get	to	write	the	script	of	the	next	revolution	in	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	take	these	 cap 	 abilities 	 	,	and	we	get	to	go	to	the	next	 place 	 s 	 	,	we	get	to	decide	what	our	new	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	are	going	to	be	.
and	i	think	to	 re 	 ally 	 	get	the	rest	of	the	way	in	that	revolution	,	we	need	to	not	just	take	our	 hand 	 s 	 	in	in	new	ways	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	take	our	 eye 	 s 	 	in	in	new	ways	.
we	need	to	see	beyond	the	surface	.
we	need	to	be	able	to	guide	what	we	're	cutting	in	a	much	better	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cancer	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	even	for	 surgeon 	 s 	 	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	a	lot	,	is	you	ca	n't	see	the	cancer	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	it	's	 hid 	 den 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	surface	.
and	so	what	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	inject	 special 	 ly 	 	designed	 marker 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 blood 	 stream 	 	that	will	target	the	cancer	.
it	will	go	,	bind	to	the	cancer	.
and	we	can	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	glow	.
and	we	can	take	special	 camera 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	look	at	it	.
now	we	know	where	we	need	to	cut	,	even	when	it	's	 be 	 low 	 	the	surface	.
we	can	take	these	 marker 	 s 	 	and	we	can	inject	them	in	a	tumor	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	we	can	follow	where	they	flow	out	from	that	tumor	 s 	 ite 	 	,	so	we	can	see	the	first	 place 	 s 	 	where	that	cancer	might	travel	.
we	can	inject	these	 dye 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 blood 	 stream 	 	,	so	that	when	we	do	a	new	vessel	and	we	bypass	a	 block 	 age 	 	on	the	heart	,	we	can	see	if	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	before	we	close	that	patient	back	up	 aga 	 in 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	 with 	 out 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	before	.
we	can	light	up	 tumor 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 kid 	 ney 	 	tumor	,	so	that	you	can	 exact 	 ly 	 	see	where	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	is	between	the	 kid 	 ney 	 	tumor	and	the	 kid 	 ney 	 	you	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	,	or	the	liver	tumor	and	the	liver	you	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	.
and	we	do	n't	even	need	to	 con 	 fine 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	macro	vision	.
we	have	 flex 	 ible 	 	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 prob 	 es 	 	that	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	body	.
and	we	can	look	at	 cell 	 s 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
i	'm	looking	at	 nerve 	 s 	 	here	.	so	these	are	 nerve 	 s 	 	you	see	,	down	on	the	bottom	,	and	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	 prob 	 e 	 	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	held	by	the	robotic	hand	,	up	at	the	top	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 ver 	 y 	 	 prototype 	 y 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
but	you	care	about	 nerve 	 s 	 	,	if	you	are	a	 sur 	 gical 	 	patient	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	let	you	keep	 con 	 tin 	 ence 	 	,	bladder	control	,	and	sexual	function	after	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	all	of	which	is	 general 	 ly 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	patient	.
so	,	with	the	combination	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	we	can	reach	it	all	,	and	we	can	see	it	all	.
we	can	heal	the	disease	.
and	we	can	 leav 	 e 	 	the	patient	whole	and	 in 	 tact 	 	and	functional	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	patient	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	patient	is	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	 some 	 one 	 	abstract	 out 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
and	that	is	not	the	case	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	all	of	you	 may 	 be 	 	,	will	at	some	point	,	or	have	 al 	 ready 	 	,	 face 	 d 	 	a	 diagnos 	 is 	 	of	cancer	,	or	heart	disease	,	or	some	organ	 dy 	 s 	 function 	 	that	's	going	to	buy	you	a	date	with	a	surgeon	.
and	when	you	get	to	that	point	--	i	mean	,	these	 mal 	 a 	 dies 	 	do	n't	care	how	 man 	 y 	 	 book 	 s 	 	you	've	written	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	you	've	 start 	 ed 	 	,	that	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	you	have	yet	to	win	,	how	much	time	you	 plan 	 ned 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	with	your	children	.
these	 mal 	 a 	 dies 	 	come	for	us	all	.
and	the	prospect	i	'm	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	you	,	of	an	 eas 	 ier 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	...
is	that	going	to	make	that	 diagnos 	 is 	 	any	less	 terrify 	 ing 	 	?
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	even	want	it	to	.
 be 	 cause 	 	facing	your	own	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	a	re	-	 evalu 	 ation 	 	of	 prior 	 ities 	 	,	and	a	 re 	 align 	 ment 	 	of	what	your	 goal 	 s 	 	are	in	life	,	 un 	 like 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	i	would	never	want	to	 depriv 	 e 	 	you	of	that	 epiph 	 any 	 	.
what	i	want	 in 	 stead 	 	,	is	for	you	to	be	whole	,	 in 	 tact 	 	,	and	functional	 en 	 ough 	 	to	go	out	and	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	,	after	you	've	 decide 	 d 	 	you	need	to	do	it	.
and	that	is	my	vision	for	your	future	.
thank	you	.
