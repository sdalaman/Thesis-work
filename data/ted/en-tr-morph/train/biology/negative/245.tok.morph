so	,	 a 	 s 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	often	do	is	use	immense	 resource 	 s 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	certain	 cap 	 abilities 	 	,	or	 achiev 	 e 	 	certain	 goal 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	essential	to	the	progress	of	science	,	or	exploration	of	what	is	possible	.
but	it	sort	of	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	a	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	fraction	of	the	world	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	exploration	or	can	benefit	from	that	technology	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 motiv 	 ates 	 	me	,	and	what	 get 	 s 	 	me	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	my	research	,	is	when	i	see	simple	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	 drastic 	 ally 	 	change	that	 distribut 	 ion 	 	and	make	the	technology	 access 	 ible 	 	to	a	much	 wide 	 r 	 	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	population	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	two	 video 	 s 	 	that	have	gotten	a	lot	of	attention	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	that	i	think	 em 	 body 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	the	nintendo	wii	remote	.
now	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	n't	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	it	's	a	$	40	video	game	 controll 	 er 	 	.
and	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 advertise 	 d 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	motion	sensor	 cap 	 abilities 	 	:	so	you	can	 s 	 wing 	 	a	tennis	 rack 	 et 	 	,	or	hit	a	 base 	 ball 	 	bat	.
but	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	me	a	lot	more	is	the	fact	that	in	the	tip	of	each	 controll 	 er 	 	is	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	high	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	 infra 	 red 	 	camera	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	two	 demo 	 s 	 	of	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 use 	 ful 	 	.
so	here	,	i	have	my	computer	set	up	with	the	 project 	 or 	 	,	and	i	have	a	wii	remote	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	top	of	it	.
and	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	you	're	in	a	school	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	lot	money	,	which	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	lot	of	 school 	 s 	 	,	or	if	you	're	in	an	 off 	 ice 	 	environment	,	and	you	want	an	 inter 	 active 	 	 white 	 board 	 	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	these	cost	about	two	to	three	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	how	to	do	is	how	to	create	one	with	a	wii	remote	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	 an 	 other 	 	piece	of	 hard 	 ware 	 	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	 infra 	 red 	 	pen	.
you	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	make	 th 	 is 	 	 your 	 self 	 	for	about	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	with	a	quick	trip	to	the	radio	 s 	 hack 	 	.
it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	got	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	a	button	and	an	 infra 	 red 	 	led	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	on	--	you	 guy 	 s 	 	ca	n't	see	it	--	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	on	 when 	 ever 	 	i	push	the	button	.
now	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	if	i	run	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	the	camera	 s 	 ees 	 	the	 infra 	 red 	 	dot	,	and	i	can	register	the	location	of	the	camera	 pixel 	 s 	 	to	the	 project 	 or 	 	 pixel 	 s 	 	.	and	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	a	 white 	 board 	 	surface	.
so	for	about	$	50	of	 hard 	 ware 	 	,	you	can	have	your	own	 white 	 board 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	adobe	photoshop	.
thank	you	.
now	,	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	i	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	on	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	have	let	people	download	it	for	free	.
and	in	the	three	 month 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	project	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	public	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 download 	 ed 	 	over	half	a	million	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 student 	 s 	 	all	around	the	world	are	 al 	 ready 	 	using	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	want	to	 quick 	 ly 	 	say	that	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	do	it	for	50	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	there	are	some	 limit 	 ations 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	approach	.
but	you	get	about	80	percent	of	the	way	there	,	for	about	one	percent	of	the	cost	.
 an 	 other 	 	nice	thing	is	that	a	camera	can	see	 multi 	 ple 	 	 dot 	 s 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	multi	-	touch	,	 inter 	 active 	 	 white 	 board 	 	system	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
for	the	second	demo	,	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	wii	remote	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	next	to	the	tv	.
so	it	's	 point 	 ing 	 	away	from	the	 dis 	 play 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 point 	 ing 	 	at	the	 dis 	 play 	 	.
and	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	if	you	put	on	,	say	,	a	pair	of	 safe 	 ty 	 	 glass 	 es 	 	,	that	have	two	 infra 	 red 	 	 dot 	 s 	 	in	them	,	what	these	two	 dot 	 s 	 	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	going	to	give	you	is	,	give	the	computer	an	 ap 	 proxim 	 ation 	 	of	your	head	location	.
and	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	application	running	on	the	computer	monitor	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	3d	room	,	with	some	 target 	 s 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	in	it	.
and	you	can	see	that	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	3d	room	--	if	you	can	see	--	kind	of	like	a	video	game	,	it	sort	of	 look 	 s 	 	3d	,	but	for	the	most	part	,	the	image	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	flat	,	and	bound	to	the	surface	of	the	screen	.
but	if	we	turn	on	head	 track 	 ing 	 	,	the	computer	can	change	the	image	that	's	on	the	screen	and	make	it	respond	to	the	head	 move 	 ments 	 	.
so	let	's	 s 	 witch 	 	back	to	that	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	little	bit	 start 	 ling 	 	to	the	game	 develop 	 ment 	 	community	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 hard 	 ware 	 	if	you	 al 	 ready 	 	have	a	nintendo	wii	.
so	i	'm	looking	forward	to	 see 	 ing 	 	some	 game 	 s 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	louis	castle	,	that	's	him	down	there	,	last	week	 announce 	 d 	 	that	 electron 	 ic 	 	 art 	 s 	 	,	one	of	the	largest	game	 publish 	 ers 	 	,	is	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	a	game	in	may	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	little	easter	egg	feature	for	 support 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	head	 track 	 ing 	 	.
so	--	and	that	's	from	less	than	five	 month 	 s 	 	from	a	prototype	in	my	lab	to	a	major	commercial	product	.
thank	you	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	me	,	what	's	 al 	 most 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	than	either	of	these	two	 product 	 s 	 	is	how	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	out	about	them	.
youtube	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	,	or	 change 	 d 	 	the	speed	,	in	which	a	single	individual	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	spread	an	idea	around	the	world	.
you	know	,	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	some	research	in	my	lab	with	a	video	camera	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	the	first	week	,	a	million	people	had	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	and	 liter 	 ally 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 student 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	,	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 post 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	youtube	 video 	 s 	 	of	them	using	my	system	or	 deriv 	 ative 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	.
so	i	hope	to	see	more	of	that	in	the	future	,	and	hope	 on 	 line 	 	video	 distribut 	 ion 	 	to	be	 embrace 	 d 	 	by	the	research	community	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
