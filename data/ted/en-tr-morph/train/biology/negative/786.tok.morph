i	'm	jon	m.	chu	.	and	i	'm	not	a	 danc 	 er 	 	,	i	'm	not	a	 choreograph 	 er 	 	--	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 film 	 maker 	 	,	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.
i	 direct 	 ed 	 	a	movie	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 call 	 ed 	 	``	step	up	2	:	the	 street 	 s 	 	.	``
 any 	 body 	 	?	 any 	 body 	 	?	 yea 	 h 	 	!
 dur 	 ing 	 	that	movie	i	got	to	meet	a	ton	of	hip	-	hop	 danc 	 ers 	 	--	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	the	best	in	the	world	--	and	they	 br 	 ought 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	the	sort	of	 under 	 ground 	 	street	culture	that	 ble 	 w 	 	my	mind	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	super	-	human	strength	and	abilities	.
they	could	fly	in	the	air	.	they	could	bend	 the 	 ir 	 	elbow	all	the	way	back	.
they	could	spin	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	for	80	 time 	 s 	 	in	a	row	.
i	'd	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
when	i	was	growing	up	,	my	heroes	 we 	 re 	 	people	like	fred	astaire	,	gene	kelly	,	michael	jackson	.
i	grew	up	in	a	musical	family	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	ultimate	heroes	.
 be 	 ing 	 	a	 s 	 hy 	 	,	little	,	 skin 	 ny 	 	asian	kid	growing	up	in	the	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	with	low	self	-	esteem	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	made	me	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	made	me	want	to	,	like	,	``	i	'm	going	to	do	that	 moon 	 walk 	 	at	that	bar	mitzvah	 to 	 night 	 	for	that	girl	.	``
and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	 t 	 hose 	 	dance	heroes	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	sort	of	 relegate 	 d 	 	to	the	 back 	 ground 	 	of	pop	 star 	 s 	 	and	music	 video 	 s 	 	.
but	after	 see 	 ing 	 	what	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	the	truth	is	,	they	have	not	 disappear 	 ed 	 	at	all	.
they	're	here	,	 get 	 ting 	 	better	and	better	every	day	.
and	dance	 ha 	 s 	 	 progress 	 ed 	 	.
it	is	 insan 	 e 	 	what	dance	is	right	now	.
dance	 ha 	 s 	 	never	had	a	better	friend	than	technology	.
 on 	 line 	 	 video 	 s 	 	and	social	 network 	 ing 	 	...
 danc 	 ers 	 	have	 create 	 d 	 	a	whole	global	 labor 	 atory 	 	 on 	 line 	 	for	dance	,	where	 kid 	 s 	 	in	japan	are	taking	 move 	 s 	 	from	a	youtube	video	 create 	 d 	 	in	detroit	,	building	on	it	 with 	 in 	 	 day 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	a	new	video	,	while	 teenager 	 s 	 	in	california	are	taking	the	japanese	video	and	 remix 	 ing 	 	it	with	a	philly	 fl 	 air 	 	to	create	a	whole	new	dance	style	in	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	every	day	.
and	from	these	 bed 	 rooms 	 	and	living	rooms	and	 gar 	 age 	 s 	 	,	with	cheap	 web 	 cam 	 s 	 	,	lies	the	world	's	great	 danc 	 ers 	 	of	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
our	fred	astaires	,	our	gene	kellys	our	michael	jacksons	are	right	at	our	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	,	and	may	not	have	that	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	us	.
so	,	we	 create 	 d 	 	the	lxd	,	sort	of	a	--	the	 leg 	 ion 	 	of	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 danc 	 ers 	 	,	a	justice	league	of	 danc 	 ers 	 	that	 believ 	 e 	 	that	dance	can	have	a	 transform 	 ative 	 	effect	on	the	world	.
a	living	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	 com 	 ic 	 	book	 s 	 eries 	 	,	but	 un 	 like 	 	spiderman	and	iron	man	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	it	.
and	we	're	going	to	show	you	some	 to 	 day 	 	.	so	,	let	me	 introduc 	 e 	 	to	you	,	some	of	our	heroes	right	now	.
we	got	madd	chadd	,	lil	'	c	,	kid	david	and	j	smooth	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	be	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	have	 f 	 un 	 	,	yell	,	 s 	 cream 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	:	the	lxd	.
:	madd	chadd	:	when	people	first	see	me	,	i	get	a	lot	of	different	 react 	 ions 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	would	think	that	 may 	 be 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	would	enjoy	it	,	but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	get	a	little	 freak 	 ed 	 	out	.
and	,	i	do	n't	know	,	i	kind	of	get	a	kick	out	of	that	a	little	bit	.
j	smooth	:	when	i	'm	in	the	zone	--	i	'm	 danc 	 ing 	 	and	free	 styl 	 ing 	 	it	--	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 visual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	picture	lines	,	and	moving	them	.
i	think	of	like	,	 transform 	 ers 	 	,	like	how	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	open	and	then	they	fold	,	they	fold	in	,	and	then	you	close	that	 pan 	 el 	 	.
and	then	 an 	 other 	 	thing	 open 	 s 	 	,	you	close	that	.
kid	david	:	it	's	kind	of	like	,	 honest 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	's	going	on	when	i	'm	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	at	that	point	it	's	just	 re 	 ally 	 	like	,	it	's	my	body	and	the	music	.
it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	conscious	decision	,	``	i	'm	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	next	,	i	'm	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
it	's	kind	of	like	 th 	 is 	 	other	level	where	you	ca	n't	make	 choice 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	it	's	just	your	body	 react 	 ing 	 	to	certain	 sound 	 s 	 	in	the	music	.
i	got	my	name	just	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	so	young	.
i	was	young	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	.	i	was	 young 	 er 	 	than	a	lot	of	the	people	i	was	 danc 	 ing 	 	with	.
so	,	it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	like	,	they	 call 	 ed 	 	me	kid	david	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	the	kid	.
l'il	c	:	i	tell	them	to	create	a	ball	,	and	then	you	just	use	that	ball	of	energy	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 throw 	 ing 	 	it	out	,	people	would	think	that	's	a	 k 	 rump 	 	move	,	that	's	a	 k 	 rump 	 	move	.
that	's	not	a	 k 	 rump 	 	move	.	you	're	going	to	throw	it	out	,	you	throw	it	out	,	and	you	hold	it	.
and	you	let	it	go	,	and	then	right	when	you	see	the	tail	,	you	grab	it	by	the	tail	,	then	you	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	in	.
and	you	just	got	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	energy	and	you	just	,	you	're	 manipul 	 ating 	 	it	.
you	know	,	you	create	power	,	then	you	tame	it	.
