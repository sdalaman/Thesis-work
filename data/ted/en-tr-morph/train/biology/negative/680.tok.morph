i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	are	new	,	 hid 	 den 	 	 tension 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	between	people	and	 institution 	 s 	 	--	 institution 	 s 	 	that	are	the	 institution 	 s 	 	that	people	inhabit	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	:	 school 	 s 	 	,	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	see	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	would	like	to	call	a	sort	of	``	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	 in 	 timacy 	 	.	``
and	what	do	i	mean	by	that	?
i	mean	that	what	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	in	fact	,	they	are	sort	of	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	communication	 channel 	 s 	 	,	they	are	 break 	 ing 	 	an	 impose 	 d 	 	 isol 	 ation 	 	that	these	 institution 	 s 	 	are	 im 	 posing 	 	on	them	.
how	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	way	,	by	 call 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mom	from	work	,	by	iming	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	by	 text 	 ing 	 	under	the	desk	.
the	 picture 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	me	are	people	that	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	come	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	person	they	communicate	with	most	.
and	 some 	 body 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	a	boyfriend	,	 some 	 body 	 	a	father	.
one	young	woman	 br 	 ought 	 	her	 grand 	 father 	 	.
for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	how	people	use	 channel 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	email	,	the	mobile	phone	,	 text 	 ing 	 	,	etc	.
what	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	see	is	that	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	people	are	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	with	five	,	six	,	seven	of	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 intima 	 te 	 	sphere	.
now	,	lets	take	some	data	.	facebook	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	some	 socio 	 logists 	 	from	facebook	--	facebook	is	the	channel	that	you	would	expect	is	the	most	 enlarg 	 en 	 ing 	 	of	all	 channel 	 s 	 	.
and	an	average	user	,	 s 	 aid 	 	cameron	marlow	,	from	facebook	,	 ha 	 s 	 	about	120	 friend 	 s 	 	.
but	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	to	,	 ha 	 s 	 	two	-	way	 ex 	 change 	 s 	 	with	,	about	four	to	six	people	on	a	regular	base	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	his	gender	.
academic	research	on	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 show 	 s 	 	100	people	on	 bud 	 dy 	 	 list 	 s 	 	,	but	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	people	chat	with	two	,	three	,	four	--	 any 	 way 	 	,	less	than	five	.
my	own	research	on	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	and	voice	 call 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	80	percent	of	the	 call 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	to	four	people	.	80	percent	.
and	when	you	go	to	skype	,	it	's	down	to	two	people	.
a	lot	of	 socio 	 logists 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	bit	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	data	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	 deploy 	 ment 	 	,	just	for	five	people	.
and	some	 socio 	 logists 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	that	it	's	a	closure	,	it	's	a	 cocoon 	 ing 	 	,	that	we	're	 dis 	 engag 	 ing 	 	from	the	public	.
and	i	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	like	to	show	you	that	if	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	who	is	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	from	where	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	social	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
there	are	three	 st 	 ories 	 	that	i	think	are	 quit 	 e 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
the	first	 gentle 	 man 	 	,	he	's	a	 bake 	 r 	 	.
and	so	he	 start 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	at	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
and	around	eight	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	he	sort	of	 sneak 	 s 	 	away	from	his	oven	,	 clean 	 s 	 	his	 hand 	 s 	 	from	the	flour	and	 call 	 s 	 	his	wife	.
he	just	 want 	 s 	 	to	wish	her	a	good	day	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	start	of	her	day	.
and	i	've	heard	 th 	 is 	 	story	a	number	of	 time 	 s 	 	.
a	young	 factor 	 y 	 	 work 	 er 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	night	 shift 	 s 	 	,	who	 manage 	 s 	 	to	sneak	away	from	the	 factor 	 y 	 	floor	,	where	there	is	cctv	by	the	way	,	and	find	a	corner	,	where	at	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	at	night	he	can	call	his	girlfriend	and	just	say	 good 	 night 	 	.
or	a	mother	who	,	at	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 manage 	 s 	 	to	find	a	corner	in	the	toilet	to	check	that	her	children	are	 safe 	 ly 	 	home	.
then	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	couple	,	there	is	a	brazilian	couple	.
they	've	lived	in	italy	for	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
they	skype	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	.
but	once	a	 fort 	 night 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	the	computer	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 din 	 ing 	 	table	,	pull	out	the	 web 	 cam 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 d 	 inner 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	family	in	sao	paulo	.	and	they	have	a	big	event	of	it	.
and	i	heard	 th 	 is 	 	story	the	first	time	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	modest	family	of	 im 	 migrant 	 s 	 	from	kosovo	in	switzerland	.
they	had	set	up	a	big	screen	in	 the 	 ir 	 	living	room	,	and	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	they	had	 break 	 fast 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
but	danny	miller	,	who	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	who	is	 work 	 ing 	 	on	filipina	migrant	women	who	 leav 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	back	in	the	philippines	,	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	about	how	much	 parent 	 ing 	 	is	going	on	through	skype	,	and	how	much	these	 mother 	 s 	 	are	 engag 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	children	through	skype	.
and	then	there	is	the	third	couple	.	they	are	two	 friend 	 s 	 	.
they	chat	to	each	other	every	day	,	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	they	've	 manage 	 d 	 	to	put	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	at	work	.
and	now	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	they	have	it	open	.
 when 	 ever 	 	they	have	a	moment	they	chat	to	each	other	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	with	 teenager 	 s 	 	and	 kid 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	school	,	under	the	table	,	and	 text 	 ing 	 	under	the	table	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 case 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 ique 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	could	tell	you	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	.
but	what	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 exception 	 al 	 	is	the	setting	.
so	,	think	of	the	three	 setting 	 s 	 	i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	you	about	:	 factor 	 y 	 	,	 migr 	 ation 	 	,	 off 	 ice 	 	.
but	it	could	be	in	a	school	,	it	could	be	an	 administr 	 ation 	 	,	it	could	be	a	hospital	.
three	 setting 	 s 	 	that	,	if	we	just	step	back	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	if	you	just	think	back	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	to	an	 off 	 ice 	 	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	to	a	 factor 	 y 	 	,	there	was	no	contact	for	the	whole	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	the	time	,	there	was	no	contact	with	your	private	sphere	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	there	was	a	public	phone	 hang 	 ing 	 	in	the	corridor	or	 some 	 where 	 	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	management	,	oh	,	that	was	a	different	story	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	had	a	direct	line	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	not	,	you	 may 	 be 	 	had	to	go	through	an	 oper 	 ator 	 	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	when	you	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	the	private	sphere	was	left	 be 	 hind 	 	you	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	norm	of	our	professional	 live 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	a	norm	and	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 expect 	 ation 	 	.
and	it	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	technical	 cap 	 ability 	 	.
the	 phone 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	there	.	but	the	 expect 	 ation 	 	was	once	you	 move 	 d 	 	in	there	your	 commit 	 ment 	 	was	fully	to	the	task	at	hand	,	fully	to	the	people	around	you	.
that	was	where	the	focus	had	to	be	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	cultural	norm	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	school	our	children	for	them	to	be	 cap 	 able 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 clea 	 vage 	 	.
if	you	think	 nurse 	 ry 	 	,	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	,	first	 year 	 s 	 	of	school	are	just	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	take	away	the	children	,	to	make	them	used	to	 stay 	 ing 	 	long	 hour 	 s 	 	away	from	 the 	 ir 	 	family	.
and	then	the	school	 enact 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	well	.
it	 mimic 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	all	the	 ritual 	 s 	 	that	we	will	find	in	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	:	 ritual 	 s 	 	of	entry	,	 ritual 	 s 	 	of	exit	,	the	 schedule 	 s 	 	,	the	 uniform 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	identify	you	,	team	-	building	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	team	building	that	will	allow	you	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	be	with	a	random	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	,	or	a	random	group	of	people	that	you	will	have	to	be	with	for	a	number	of	time	.
and	of	course	,	the	major	thing	:	learn	to	pay	attention	,	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	and	focus	your	attention	.
 th 	 is 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	about	150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	 on 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	birth	of	modern	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	,	and	of	industrial	revolution	.
when	people	 bas 	 ically 	 	had	to	go	 some 	 where 	 	else	to	work	and	carry	out	the	work	.
and	when	with	modern	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rational	approach	,	where	there	was	a	clear	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	the	private	sphere	and	the	public	sphere	.
so	,	 un 	 til 	 	then	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 trade 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	the	land	they	 we 	 re 	 	 labor 	 ing 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	the	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	you	think	,	it	's	 permeate 	 d 	 	our	whole	culture	,	even	our	cities	.
if	you	think	of	 med 	 ieval 	 	cities	,	 med 	 ieval 	 	cities	the	 bo 	 rough 	 s 	 	all	have	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 guild 	 s 	 	and	 profession 	 s 	 	that	lived	there	.
now	we	have	 sprawl 	 ing 	 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 suburb 	 ia 	 s 	 	that	are	well	distinct	from	production	 area 	 s 	 	and	commercial	 area 	 s 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	over	these	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	class	system	that	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
so	the	lower	the	 stat 	 us 	 	of	the	job	and	of	the	person	 carry 	 ing 	 	out	,	the	more	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	he	would	be	from	his	personal	sphere	.
people	have	taken	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	contact	all	through	the	day	or	in	all	 type 	 s 	 	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
and	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 massive 	 ly 	 	.
the	pew	institute	,	which	 produce 	 s 	 	good	data	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	on	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	that	--	and	i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	number	is	 conserv 	 ative 	 	--	50	percent	of	 any 	 body 	 	with	email	access	at	work	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	private	email	from	his	 off 	 ice 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	the	number	is	 conserv 	 ative 	 	.
in	my	own	research	,	we	saw	that	the	peak	for	private	email	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	the	country	.
75	percent	of	people	admit	 do 	 ing 	 	private	 conversation 	 s 	 	from	work	on	 the 	 ir 	 	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	.
100	percent	are	using	text	.
the	point	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	re	-	appropriation	of	the	personal	sphere	is	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	with	all	 institution 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	the	u.s.	 arm 	 y 	 	 socio 	 logists 	 	are	 discuss 	 ing 	 	of	the	impact	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	of	 soldier 	 s 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	contact	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
but	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 block 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	access	.
and	every	day	,	every	single	day	,	i	read	news	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	 cr 	 ing 	 e 	 	,	like	a	$	15	fine	to	 kid 	 s 	 	in	texas	,	for	using	,	every	time	they	take	out	 the 	 ir 	 	mobile	phone	in	school	.
 im 	 mediate 	 	 dismiss 	 al 	 	to	bus	 driver 	 s 	 	in	new	york	,	if	 s 	 een 	 	with	a	mobile	phone	in	a	hand	.

 be 	 hind 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	of	security	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	which	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 argument 	 s 	 	for	social	control	,	in	fact	what	is	going	on	is	that	these	 institution 	 s 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	who	,	in	fact	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	right	to	self	determine	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	,	to	decide	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	should	,	or	not	,	be	 isolate 	 d 	 	.
and	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	block	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	of	a	 great 	 er 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 in 	 timacy 	 	.
