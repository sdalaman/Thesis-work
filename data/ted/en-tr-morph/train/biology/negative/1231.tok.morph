a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	40	year	-	old	woman	came	to	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	in	a	hospital	close	to	where	i	live	,	and	she	was	 br 	 ought 	 	in	 con 	 fused 	 	.
her	blood	pressure	was	an	 alarm 	 ing 	 	230	over	170	.
 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	she	went	 in 	 to 	 	cardiac	collapse	.
she	was	 re 	 suscit 	 ated 	 	,	 stabil 	 ized 	 	,	 whisk 	 ed 	 	over	to	a	cat	 s 	 can 	 	 suit 	 e 	 	right	next	to	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	blood	 clot 	 s 	 	in	the	lung	.
and	the	cat	 s 	 can 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	no	blood	 clot 	 s 	 	in	the	lung	,	but	it	 show 	 ed 	 	 bi 	 lateral 	 	,	visible	,	 palp 	 able 	 	breast	 masse 	 s 	 	,	breast	 tumor 	 s 	 	,	that	had	 metasta 	 sized 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	all	over	the	body	.
and	the	real	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	was	,	if	you	look	through	her	 record 	 s 	 	,	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	in	four	or	five	other	health	care	 institution 	 s 	 	in	the	 p 	 reced 	 ing 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	may	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 here 	 s 	 y 	 	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	at	ted	,	but	i	'd	like	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	i	think	,	in	medicine	to	come	in	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	the	power	of	the	human	hand	--	to	touch	,	to	comfort	,	to	 diagnos 	 e 	 	and	to	 br 	 ing 	 	about	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	first	to	 th 	 is 	 	person	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	image	you	may	or	may	not	 recogn 	 ize 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 ir 	 	arthur	conan	doyle	.
since	we	're	in	edinburgh	,	i	'm	a	big	fan	of	conan	doyle	.
you	might	not	know	that	conan	doyle	went	to	medical	school	here	in	edinburgh	,	and	his	character	,	sherlock	holmes	,	was	inspired	by	 s 	 ir 	 	joseph	bell	.
joseph	bell	was	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	teacher	by	all	 account 	 s 	 	.
and	conan	doyle	,	writing	about	bell	,	 de 	 scribed 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	between	bell	and	his	 student 	 s 	 	.
so	picture	bell	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	 out 	 patient 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	 student 	 s 	 	all	around	him	,	 patient 	 s 	 	 sign 	 ing 	 	up	in	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 register 	 ed 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	in	.
and	a	woman	 come 	 s 	 	in	with	a	child	,	and	conan	doyle	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	.
the	woman	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.	``
bell	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	what	sort	of	 cross 	 ing 	 	did	you	have	on	the	 ferr 	 y 	 	from	burntisland	?	``
she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	it	was	good	.	``
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	what	did	you	do	with	the	other	child	?	``
she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	left	him	with	my	sister	at	leith	.	``
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	and	did	you	take	the	 short 	 cut 	 	down	inverleith	row	to	get	here	to	the	 in 	 firm 	 ary 	 	?	``
she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	did	.	``
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	would	you	still	be	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	 lin 	 oleum 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	?	``
and	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	am.	``
and	bell	then	 go 	 es 	 	on	to	explain	to	the	 student 	 s 	 	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	see	,	when	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	'	good	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	'	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	her	fife	accent	.
and	the	 near 	 est 	 	 ferr 	 y 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	from	fife	is	from	burntisland	.
and	so	she	must	have	taken	the	 ferr 	 y 	 	over	.
you	notice	that	the	coat	she	's	 carry 	 ing 	 	is	too	small	for	the	child	who	is	with	her	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	she	 start 	 ed 	 	out	the	journey	with	two	children	,	but	 drop 	 ped 	 	one	off	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
you	notice	the	clay	on	the	 sole 	 s 	 	of	her	feet	.
 s 	 uch 	 	red	clay	is	not	found	 with 	 in 	 	a	hundred	 mile 	 s 	 	of	edinburgh	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	in	the	 botanic 	 al 	 	 garden 	 s 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	she	took	a	short	cut	down	inverleith	row	to	 arriv 	 e 	 	here	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 der 	 mat 	 itis 	 	on	the	 finger 	 s 	 	of	her	right	hand	,	a	 der 	 mat 	 itis 	 	that	is	 un 	 ique 	 	to	the	 lin 	 oleum 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	in	burntisland	.	``
and	when	bell	 actual 	 ly 	 	 strip 	 s 	 	the	patient	,	 begin 	 s 	 	to	examine	the	patient	,	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	imagine	how	much	more	he	would	discern	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	teacher	of	medicine	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	student	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	was	so	inspired	by	that	story	.
but	you	might	not	 real 	 ize 	 	that	our	ability	to	look	 in 	 to 	 	the	body	in	 th 	 is 	 	simple	way	,	using	our	 sense 	 s 	 	,	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	.
the	picture	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	is	of	leopold	auenbrugger	who	,	in	the	late	1700s	,	 discover 	 ed 	 	 percuss 	 ion 	 	.
and	the	story	is	that	leopold	auenbrugger	was	the	son	of	an	 in 	 n 	 keeper 	 	.
and	his	father	used	to	go	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 base 	 ment 	 	to	tap	on	the	 side 	 s 	 	of	 cask 	 s 	 	of	wine	to	determine	how	much	wine	was	left	and	 whet 	 her 	 	to	 re 	 order 	 	.
and	so	when	auenbrugger	 be 	 came 	 	a	physician	,	he	 beg 	 an 	 	to	do	the	same	thing	.
he	 beg 	 an 	 	to	tap	on	the	 chest 	 s 	 	of	his	 patient 	 s 	 	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 abdomen 	 s 	 	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	we	know	about	 percuss 	 ion 	 	,	which	you	can	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ultra 	 sound 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	day	--	organ	 enlarg 	 ement 	 	,	fluid	around	the	heart	,	fluid	in	the	 lung 	 s 	 	,	abdominal	 change 	 s 	 	--	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	he	 de 	 scribed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 man 	 u 	 script 	 	``	inventum	novum	,	``	``	new	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	``	which	would	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 obscur 	 ity 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	fact	that	 th 	 is 	 	physician	,	corvisart	,	a	famous	french	physician	--	famous	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	physician	to	 th 	 is 	 	 gentle 	 man 	 	--	corvisart	 re 	 popular 	 ized 	 	and	 re 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	the	work	.
and	it	was	 follow 	 ed 	 	a	year	or	two	 lat 	 er 	 	by	laennec	 discover 	 ing 	 	the	stethoscope	.
laennec	,	it	is	 s 	 aid 	 	,	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	paris	and	saw	two	children	 play 	 ing 	 	with	a	stick	.
one	was	 scratch 	 ing 	 	at	the	end	of	the	stick	,	 an 	 other 	 	child	 listen 	 ed 	 	at	the	other	end	.
and	laennec	thought	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	to	listen	to	the	chest	or	listen	to	the	abdomen	using	what	he	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	cylinder	.	``
 lat 	 er 	 	he	 re 	 named 	 	it	the	stethoscope	.
and	that	is	how	stethoscope	and	 au 	 s 	 cult 	 ation 	 	was	born	.
so	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	the	late	1800s	,	early	1900s	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	the	 barb 	 er 	 	surgeon	had	 give 	 n 	 	way	to	the	physician	who	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	 diagnos 	 is 	 	.
if	you	'll	recall	,	prior	to	that	time	,	no	matter	what	ailed	you	,	you	went	to	see	the	 barb 	 er 	 	surgeon	who	wound	up	 cup 	 ping 	 	you	,	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	you	,	 pur 	 ging 	 	you	.
and	,	oh	 y 	 es 	 	,	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	,	he	would	give	you	a	 hair 	 cut 	 	--	short	on	the	 side 	 s 	 	,	long	in	the	back	--	and	pull	your	tooth	while	he	was	at	it	.
he	made	no	attempt	at	 diagnos 	 is 	 	.
in	fact	,	some	of	you	might	well	know	that	the	 barb 	 er 	 	pole	,	the	red	and	white	 strip 	 es 	 	,	 represent 	 s 	 	the	blood	 band 	 age 	 s 	 	of	the	 barb 	 er 	 	surgeon	,	and	the	 receptacle 	 s 	 	on	either	end	represent	the	 pot 	 s 	 	in	which	the	blood	was	 collect 	 ed 	 	.
but	the	 arriv 	 al 	 	of	 au 	 s 	 cult 	 ation 	 	and	 percuss 	 ion 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	a	sea	change	,	a	moment	when	 physician 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	look	 in 	 side 	 	the	body	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	i	think	,	 represent 	 s 	 	the	pinnacle	,	the	peak	,	of	that	 clinic 	 al 	 	era	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	 paint 	 ing 	 	:	``	the	doctor	``	by	luke	fildes	.
luke	fildes	was	 commission 	 ed 	 	to	paint	 th 	 is 	 	by	tate	,	who	then	 establish 	 ed 	 	the	tate	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
and	tate	 ask 	 ed 	 	fildes	to	paint	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	of	social	 import 	 ance 	 	.
and	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	fildes	 pick 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	.
fildes	'	 old 	 est 	 	son	,	philip	,	 di 	 ed 	 	at	the	age	of	nine	on	christmas	eve	after	a	brief	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
and	fildes	was	so	taken	by	the	physician	who	held	vigil	at	the	 bed 	 side 	 	for	two	,	three	 night 	 s 	 	,	that	he	 decide 	 d 	 	that	he	would	try	and	depict	the	physician	in	our	time	--	 al 	 most 	 	a	tribute	to	 th 	 is 	 	physician	.
and	 h 	 ence 	 	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	``	the	doctor	,	``	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	on	 calendar 	 s 	 	,	 post 	 age 	 	 stamp 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
i	've	often	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	what	would	fildes	have	 d 	 one 	 	had	he	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	paint	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	in	the	modern	era	,	in	the	year	2011	?
would	he	have	 substitut 	 ed 	 	a	computer	screen	for	where	he	had	the	patient	?
i	've	gotten	 in 	 to 	 	some	trouble	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	for	 say 	 ing 	 	that	the	patient	in	the	bed	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 be 	 come 	 	an	icon	for	the	real	patient	who	's	in	the	computer	.
i	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	a	term	for	that	 ent 	 ity 	 	in	the	computer	.
i	call	it	the	ipatient	.
the	ipatient	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	care	all	 a 	 cross 	 	america	.
the	real	patient	often	 wonder 	 s 	 	,	where	is	 every 	 one 	 	?
when	are	they	going	to	come	by	and	explain	 thing 	 s 	 	to	me	?
who	's	in	charge	?
there	's	a	real	 dis 	 junction 	 	between	the	patient	's	 per 	 ception 	 	and	our	own	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 physician 	 s 	 	of	the	best	medical	care	.
i	want	to	show	you	a	picture	of	what	 round 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	when	i	was	in	training	.
the	focus	was	around	the	patient	.
we	went	from	bed	to	bed	.	the	 attend 	 ing 	 	physician	was	in	charge	.
too	often	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	 round 	 s 	 	look	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	is	taking	place	in	a	room	far	away	from	the	patient	.
the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	is	all	about	 image 	 s 	 	on	the	computer	,	data	.
and	the	one	critical	piece	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	that	of	the	patient	.
now	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	by	two	 anecdote 	 s 	 	that	i	want	to	share	with	you	.
one	had	to	do	with	a	friend	of	mine	who	had	a	breast	cancer	,	had	a	small	breast	cancer	 detect 	 ed 	 	--	had	her	 lump 	 ectomy 	 	in	the	town	in	which	i	lived	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	when	i	was	in	texas	.
and	she	then	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	 research 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	best	cancer	center	in	the	world	to	get	her	 sub 	 sequent 	 	care	.
and	she	found	the	place	and	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	there	,	went	there	.
which	is	why	i	was	 surprise 	 d 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	to	see	her	back	in	our	own	town	,	 get 	 ting 	 	her	 sub 	 sequent 	 	care	with	her	private	 onco 	 logist 	 	.
and	i	 press 	 ed 	 	her	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	,	``	why	did	you	come	back	and	get	your	care	here	?	``
and	she	was	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	tell	me	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	cancer	center	was	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
it	had	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	,	giant	 at 	 rium 	 	,	 val 	 et 	 	 park 	 ing 	 	,	a	piano	that	 play 	 ed 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	a	 con 	 cierge 	 	that	took	you	around	from	here	to	there	.
but	,	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	they	did	not	touch	my	 breast 	 s 	 	.	``
now	you	and	i	could	 argu 	 e 	 	that	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	did	not	need	to	touch	her	 breast 	 s 	 	.
they	had	her	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	 in 	 side 	 	out	.
they	 under 	 stood 	 	her	breast	cancer	at	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	level	;	they	had	no	need	to	touch	her	 breast 	 s 	 	.
but	to	her	,	it	 matter 	 ed 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	.
it	was	 en 	 ough 	 	for	her	to	make	the	decision	to	get	her	 sub 	 sequent 	 	care	with	her	private	 onco 	 logist 	 	who	,	every	time	she	went	,	 examine 	 d 	 	both	 breast 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 axilla 	 ry 	 	tail	,	 examine 	 d 	 	her	axilla	 care 	 fully 	 	,	 examine 	 d 	 	her	 cerv 	 ical 	 	region	,	her	 ing 	 u 	 in 	 al 	 	region	,	did	a	thorough	 ex 	 am 	 	.
and	to	her	,	that	spoke	of	a	kind	of	 attentive 	 ness 	 	that	she	 need 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	that	anecdote	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	 an 	 other 	 	experience	that	i	had	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	when	i	was	in	texas	,	before	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	stanford	.
i	had	a	reputation	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 patient 	 s 	 	with	chronic	fatigue	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	reputation	you	would	wish	on	your	worst	 ene 	 my 	 	.
i	say	that	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	difficult	 patient 	 s 	 	.
they	have	often	 be 	 en 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	have	had	bad	 experience 	 s 	 	with	medical	care	and	they	come	to	you	fully	prepared	for	you	to	join	the	long	list	of	people	who	's	about	to	disappoint	them	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	with	my	first	patient	that	i	could	not	do	justice	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	patient	with	all	the	 record 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	a	new	patient	visit	of	45	 minute 	 s 	 	.
there	was	just	no	way	.
and	if	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	,	i	'd	disappoint	them	.
and	so	i	hit	on	 th 	 is 	 	method	where	i	 invit 	 ed 	 	the	patient	to	tell	me	the	story	for	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	first	visit	,	and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	not	to	interrupt	them	.
we	know	the	average	american	physician	 interrupt 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	patient	in	14	 second 	 s 	 	.
and	if	i	ever	get	to	heaven	,	it	will	be	 be 	 cause 	 	i	held	my	piece	for	45	 minute 	 s 	 	and	did	not	interrupt	my	patient	.
i	then	 schedule 	 d 	 	the	physical	 ex 	 am 	 	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	 h 	 ence 	 	,	and	when	the	patient	came	for	the	physical	,	i	was	able	to	do	a	thorough	physical	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	to	do	.
i	like	to	think	that	i	do	a	thorough	physical	 ex 	 am 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	the	whole	visit	was	now	about	the	physical	,	i	could	do	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	thorough	 ex 	 am 	 	.
and	i	remember	my	 ver 	 y 	 	first	patient	in	that	 s 	 eries 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	tell	me	more	 histo 	 ry 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	what	was	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	the	physical	 ex 	 am 	 	visit	.
and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	my	ritual	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	begin	with	the	 puls 	 e 	 	,	then	i	examine	the	 hand 	 s 	 	,	then	i	look	at	the	nail	 bed 	 s 	 	,	then	i	slide	my	hand	up	to	the	 epit 	 rochlear 	 	 no 	 de 	 	,	and	i	was	 in 	 to 	 	my	ritual	.
and	when	my	ritual	 beg 	 an 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 volu 	 ble 	 	patient	 beg 	 an 	 	to	quiet	down	.
and	i	remember	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 eer 	 ie 	 	sense	that	the	patient	and	i	had	 s 	 lipped 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	a	primitive	ritual	in	which	i	had	a	role	and	the	patient	had	a	role	.
and	when	i	was	 d 	 one 	 	,	the	patient	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	with	some	awe	,	``	i	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	 examine 	 d 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	before	.	``
now	if	that	 we 	 re 	 	true	,	it	's	a	true	 condemn 	 ation 	 	of	our	health	care	system	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	in	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
i	then	 proceed 	 ed 	 	to	tell	the	patient	,	once	the	patient	was	 dress 	 ed 	 	,	the	standard	 thing 	 s 	 	that	the	person	must	have	heard	in	other	 institution 	 s 	 	,	which	is	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	in	your	head	.
the	good	news	,	it	's	not	cancer	,	it	's	not	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	,	it	's	not	 cocci 	 dioidomycosis 	 	or	some	 obscur 	 e 	 	 f 	 ung 	 al 	 	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
the	bad	news	is	we	do	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	 caus 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	here	's	what	you	should	do	,	here	's	what	we	should	do	.	``
and	i	would	lay	out	all	the	standard	 treat 	 ment 	 	 option 	 s 	 	that	the	patient	had	heard	 else 	 where 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	that	if	my	patient	 g 	 ave 	 	up	the	quest	for	the	magic	doctor	,	the	magic	 treat 	 ment 	 	and	 beg 	 an 	 	with	me	on	a	course	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 well 	 ness 	 	,	it	was	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	 earn 	 ed 	 	the	right	to	tell	them	these	 thing 	 s 	 	by	virtue	of	the	examination	.
 some 	 thing 	 	of	 import 	 ance 	 	had	 trans 	 pi 	 red 	 	in	the	 ex 	 change 	 	.
i	took	 th 	 is 	 	to	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	at	stanford	in	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	and	told	them	the	same	story	.
and	they	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	well	you	are	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	a	classic	ritual	.	``
and	they	 help 	 ed 	 	me	understand	that	 ritual 	 s 	 	are	all	about	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
we	marry	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	with	great	pomp	and	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	and	expense	to	signal	our	 depart 	 ure 	 	from	a	life	of	 s 	 ol 	 itude 	 	and	 mis 	 ery 	 	and	 lone 	 lines 	 s 	 	to	one	of	 e 	 ternal 	 	 bli 	 s 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	why	you	're	 laugh 	 ing 	 	.
that	was	the	original	intent	,	was	it	not	?
we	signal	 transit 	 ions 	 	of	power	with	 ritual 	 s 	 	.
we	signal	the	 pass 	 age 	 	of	a	life	with	 ritual 	 s 	 	.
 ritual 	 s 	 	are	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
they	're	all	about	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
well	i	would	submit	to	you	that	the	ritual	of	one	individual	coming	to	 an 	 other 	 	and	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	would	not	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	 preach 	 er 	 	or	rabbi	,	and	then	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	on	top	of	that	,	 dis 	 rob 	 ing 	 	and	 allow 	 ing 	 	touch	--	i	would	submit	to	you	that	that	is	a	ritual	of	 exceed 	 ing 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	.
and	if	you	 short 	 change 	 	that	ritual	by	not	 un 	 dress 	 ing 	 	the	patient	,	by	 listen 	 ing 	 	with	your	stethoscope	on	top	of	the	 night 	 gown 	 	,	by	not	 do 	 ing 	 	a	complete	 ex 	 am 	 	,	you	have	 bypass 	 ed 	 	on	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	seal	the	patient	-	physician	relationship	.
i	am	a	writer	,	and	i	want	to	close	by	 read 	 ing 	 	you	a	short	 pass 	 age 	 	that	i	wrote	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	 ver 	 y 	 	much	with	 th 	 is 	 	scene	.
i	'm	an	 infect 	 ious 	 	disease	physician	,	and	in	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	of	hiv	,	before	we	had	our	 medic 	 ations 	 	,	i	 pre 	 sided 	 	over	so	 man 	 y 	 	 scene 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	remember	,	every	time	i	went	to	a	patient	's	 death 	 bed 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	in	the	hospital	or	at	home	,	i	remember	my	sense	of	failure	--	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	i	do	n't	know	what	i	have	to	say	;	i	do	n't	know	what	i	can	say	;	i	do	n't	know	what	i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	.
and	out	of	that	sense	of	failure	,	i	remember	,	i	would	 al 	 ways 	 	examine	the	patient	.
i	would	pull	down	the	 eye 	 lids 	 	.
i	would	look	at	the	tongue	.
i	would	percuss	the	chest	.	i	would	listen	to	the	heart	.
i	would	feel	the	abdomen	.
i	remember	so	 man 	 y 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 name 	 s 	 	still	 vivi 	 d 	 	on	my	tongue	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	still	so	clear	.
i	remember	so	 man 	 y 	 	huge	,	 hollow 	 ed 	 	out	,	 haunt 	 ed 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 star 	 ing 	 	up	at	me	 a 	 s 	 	i	 perform 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ritual	.
and	then	the	next	day	,	i	would	come	,	and	i	would	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	read	you	 th 	 is 	 	one	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	about	one	patient	.
``	i	recall	one	patient	who	was	at	that	point	no	more	than	a	skeleton	 en 	 case 	 d 	 	in	 shrink 	 ing 	 	skin	,	 un 	 able 	 	to	speak	,	his	mouth	 crust 	 ed 	 	with	 candid 	 a 	 	that	was	resistant	to	the	usual	 medic 	 ations 	 	.
when	he	saw	me	on	what	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	his	last	 hour 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	,	his	 hand 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	in	 s 	 low 	 	motion	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	he	was	up	to	,	his	stick	 finger 	 s 	 	made	 the 	 ir 	 	way	up	to	his	pajama	shirt	,	 fum 	 bling 	 	with	his	 button 	 s 	 	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	he	was	 want 	 ing 	 	to	 ex 	 pose 	 	his	wicker	-	basket	chest	to	me	.
it	was	an	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	,	an	 invit 	 ation 	 	.
i	did	not	decline	.
i	 percuss 	 ed 	 	.	i	 palp 	 ated 	 	.	i	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	the	chest	.
i	think	he	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	must	have	known	by	then	that	it	was	vital	for	me	just	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	him	.
 n 	 either 	 	of	us	could	skip	 th 	 is 	 	ritual	,	which	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 detect 	 ing 	 	 ral 	 es 	 	in	the	lung	,	or	 find 	 ing 	 	the	 gall 	 op 	 	rhythm	of	heart	failure	.
no	,	 th 	 is 	 	ritual	was	about	the	one	 mess 	 age 	 	that	 physician 	 s 	 	have	 need 	 ed 	 	to	convey	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	god	 know 	 s 	 	,	of	late	,	in	our	 hub 	 ris 	 	,	we	seem	to	have	 drift 	 ed 	 	away	.
we	seem	to	have	 for 	 gotten 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	with	the	explosion	of	knowledge	,	the	whole	human	genome	 ma 	 pped 	 	out	at	our	feet	,	we	are	 l 	 ull 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 in 	 attention 	 	,	 forget 	 ting 	 	that	the	ritual	is	 cath 	 art 	 ic 	 	to	the	physician	,	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	the	patient	--	 forget 	 ting 	 	that	the	ritual	 ha 	 s 	 	meaning	and	a	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	to	convey	to	the	patient	.
and	the	 mess 	 age 	 	,	which	i	did	n't	fully	understand	then	,	even	 a 	 s 	 	i	 deliver 	 ed 	 	it	,	and	which	i	understand	better	now	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	i	will	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	be	there	.
i	will	see	you	through	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	will	never	abandon	you	.
i	will	be	with	you	through	the	end	.	``
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
