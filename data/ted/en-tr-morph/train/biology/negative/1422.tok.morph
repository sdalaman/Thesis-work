last	january	,	my	company	,	 far 	 k 	 .com 	 	,	was	 su 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	yahoo	,	msn	,	reddit	,	aol	,	techcrunch	and	 other 	 s 	 	by	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	gooseberry	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	.
gooseberry	owned	a	patent	for	the	creation	and	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	news	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	via	email	.
now	it	may	seem	kind	of	strange	that	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 patent 	 ed 	 	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	happen	all	the	time	.
take	 some 	 thing 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	and	patent	it	for	an	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	technology	--	like	phone	 call 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	or	video	 list 	 ing 	 s 	 	for	tv	 show 	 s 	 	or	radio	but	for	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	.
the	problem	with	these	 patent 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	are	 obscur 	 e 	 	and	the	patent	system	is	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	most	of	these	 law 	 suit 	 s 	 	end	in	 settle 	 ments 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 settle 	 ments 	 	are	under	a	non	-	 dis 	 closure 	 	 agree 	 ment 	 	,	no	one	 know 	 s 	 	what	the	 term 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	the	patent	troll	can	claim	that	they	won	the	case	.
in	the	case	of	gooseberry	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	patent	on	 email 	 ing 	 	news	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	had	sort	of	a	fatal	flaw	 a 	 s 	 	it	 per 	 tain 	 ed 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	that	was	that	in	the	 main 	 stream 	 	media	world	there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	definition	for	news	 re 	 lease 	 	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	is	press	 re 	 lease 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	in	p.r	.
now	my	company	,	fark	,	 deal 	 s 	 	with	news	,	 o 	 sten 	 s 	 ibly 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	we	 we 	 re 	 	not	in	 viol 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	patent	.
so	case	closed	,	right	?
wrong	.
one	of	the	major	 problem 	 s 	 	with	patent	law	is	that	,	in	the	case	that	when	you	are	 su 	 ed 	 	by	a	patent	troll	,	the	burden	of	proof	that	you	did	not	 in 	 fringe 	 	on	the	patent	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	on	the	 defend 	 ant 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	you	have	to	prove	that	you	do	not	 in 	 fringe 	 	on	the	patent	they	're	suing	you	on	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	can	take	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	.
you	need	to	know	that	the	average	patent	troll	defense	 cost 	 s 	 	two	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	 take 	 s 	 	18	 month 	 s 	 	when	you	win	.
that	is	your	best	case	 out 	 come 	 	when	you	get	 su 	 ed 	 	by	a	patent	troll	.
now	i	had	 hop 	 ed 	 	to	team	up	with	some	of	these	 large 	 r 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	order	to	defend	against	 th 	 is 	 	 law 	 suit 	 	,	but	one	-	by	-	one	they	 settl 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	case	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	--	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 in 	 fringe 	 d 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	patent	--	not	a	one	of	them	.
and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 settl 	 ing 	 	out	.
the	reason	they	 settl 	 ed 	 	out	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 cheap 	 er 	 	to	settle	than	to	fight	the	 law 	 suit 	 	--	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	two	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	and	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	lose	.
it	would	 al 	 so 	 	constitute	a	massive	 distract 	 ion 	 	for	management	of	a	company	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	a	small	eight	-	man	shop	like	my	company	.
six	 month 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 law 	 suit 	 	,	we	 final 	 ly 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	 discover 	 y 	 	phase	.
and	in	 discover 	 y 	 	phase	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	patent	troll	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	provide	 screen 	 shot 	 s 	 	of	fark	where	the	 in 	 fringe 	 ment 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	patent	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	.
now	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	no	 s 	 uch 	 	 screen 	 shot 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	,	but	 sudden 	 ly 	 	gooseberry	 want 	 ed 	 	to	settle	.
 the 	 ir 	 	attorney	:	``	ah	,	 y 	 es 	 	.	my	company	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 re 	 organ 	 ization 	 	on	our	end	.	``
never	mind	the	fact	that	the	address	led	to	a	strip	mall	 some 	 where 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	l.a	.
with	no	 employ 	 ees 	 	.
``	and	we	'd	like	to	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	close	 th 	 is 	 	out	.
so	would	you	mind	giving	us	your	best	and	final	 off 	 er 	 	?	``
my	 respons 	 e 	 	:	``	how	about	 noth 	 ing 	 	?	!	``
we	did	n't	have	high	 hope 	 s 	 	for	that	 out 	 come 	 	.
but	they	 settl 	 ed 	 	.
no	counter	 off 	 er 	 	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	before	,	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	i	can	talk	to	you	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	non	-	 dis 	 closure 	 	 agree 	 ment 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	case	.
now	how	did	that	happen	?
well	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 settle 	 ment 	 	process	,	when	we	 receiv 	 ed 	 	our	copy	,	i	 s 	 truck 	 	it	.
my	attorney	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 na 	 h 	 	,	no	chance	of	that	 work 	 ing 	 	.	``
it	came	back	 sign 	 ed 	 	.
now	why	?	you	can	call	them	.
they	're	not	under	nda	either	.
now	what	did	i	learn	from	 th 	 is 	 	case	?	well	,	three	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	if	you	can	,	do	n't	fight	the	patent	,	fight	the	 in 	 fringe 	 ment 	 	.
 patent 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	 over 	 turn 	 	.
 in 	 fringe 	 ment 	 	is	a	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	 dis 	 prove 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	make	it	clear	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	that	either	you	have	no	money	at	all	or	that	you	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	money	with	your	attorney	 fight 	 ing 	 	the	troll	than	 actual 	 ly 	 	giving	them	the	money	.
now	the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	patent	 troll 	 s 	 	are	paid	a	 percent 	 age 	 	of	what	they	're	able	to	 re 	 cover 	 	in	 settle 	 ments 	 	.
if	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	clear	to	them	that	they	can	not	 re 	 cover 	 	any	money	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	less	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 pur 	 suing 	 	the	case	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	you	can	tell	them	that	you	will	make	 th 	 is 	 	process	 a 	 s 	 	 annoy 	 ing 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	difficult	 a 	 s 	 	possible	for	them	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tactic	that	patent	 troll 	 s 	 	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	use	on	people	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	way	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	paid	on	 con 	 ting 	 ency 	 	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	well	in	reverse	.
do	n't	forget	that	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
well	to	sum	up	,	it	 boil 	 s 	 	down	to	one	thing	:	do	n't	 negoti 	 ate 	 	with	 terrorist 	 s 	 	.
patent	 troll 	 s 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	more	damage	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	than	any	domestic	or	foreign	terrorist	 organ 	 ization 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	every	year	.
and	what	do	they	do	with	that	money	?
they	plow	it	right	back	 in 	 to 	 	filing	more	troll	 law 	 suit 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	point	in	the	talk	where	i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	come	up	with	some	kind	of	a	solution	for	the	patent	system	.
and	the	problem	with	that	is	that	there	are	two	 ver 	 y 	 	large	industry	 group 	 s 	 	that	have	different	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	in	mind	for	the	patent	system	.
the	health	care	industry	would	like	 strong 	 er 	 	 protect 	 ions 	 	for	 inventor 	 s 	 	.
the	hi	-	tech	industry	would	like	 strong 	 er 	 	 protect 	 ions 	 	for	 produce 	 rs 	 	.
and	these	 goal 	 s 	 	are	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 dia 	 metric 	 ally 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	,	but	they	are	at	 odd 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	patent	 troll 	 s 	 	can	kind	of	live	in	the	space	in	between	.
so	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	i	'm	not	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	to	have	a	solution	for	the	patent	troll	problem	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	did	have	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	and	it	was	kind	of	good	.
and	i	thought	,	``	i	should	patent	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
 be 	 hold 	 	,	patent	 in 	 fringe 	 ment 	 	via	mobile	 de 	 vice 	 	--	defined	 a 	 s 	 	a	computer	which	is	not	 station 	 ary 	 	.
my	solution	:	 a 	 ward 	 	me	 th 	 is 	 	patent	and	i	will	troll	them	out	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
thank	you	.
