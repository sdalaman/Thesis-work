roy	gould	:	less	than	a	year	from	now	,	the	world	is	going	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	 inter 	 national 	 	year	of	 astro 	 nomy 	 	,	which	 mark 	 s 	 	the	400th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	galileo	's	first	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	the	night	sky	through	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
in	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	,	the	world	is	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	launch	of	a	new	 invent 	 ion 	 	from	 micro 	 soft 	 	research	,	which	i	think	is	going	to	have	 a 	 s 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	an	impact	on	the	way	we	view	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 a 	 s 	 	galileo	did	four	centuries	ago	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	and	i	want	to	thank	ted	and	 micro 	 soft 	 	for	 allow 	 ing 	 	me	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	your	attention	.
and	i	want	to	urge	you	,	when	you	get	a	chance	,	to	give	it	a	 close 	 r 	 	look	at	the	ted	lab	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	.
the	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	 take 	 s 	 	the	best	 image 	 s 	 	from	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	on	earth	and	in	space	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 wove 	 n 	 	them	 seam 	 lessly 	 	to	produce	a	 hol 	 istic 	 	view	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
it	's	going	to	change	the	way	we	do	 astro 	 nomy 	 	,	it	's	going	to	change	the	way	we	teach	 astro 	 nomy 	 	and	i	think	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	it	's	going	to	change	the	way	we	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ted	 meet 	 ing 	 	in	our	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	'	day	,	that	might	not	be	so	big	a	claim	.
in	1920	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	drink	;	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	woman	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	vote	;	and	if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	up	at	the	 star 	 s 	 	and	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	on	a	summer	night	,	what	you	saw	was	thought	to	be	the	entire	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	head	of	harvard	's	 observ 	 atory 	 	back	then	 g 	 ave 	 	a	great	debate	in	which	he	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	 galax 	 y 	 	was	the	entire	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
harvard	was	wrong	,	big	time	.
of	course	,	we	know	 to 	 day 	 	that	 galax 	 ies 	 	extend	far	beyond	our	own	 galax 	 y 	 	.
we	can	see	all	the	way	out	to	the	edge	of	the	 observ 	 able 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	all	the	way	back	in	time	,	 al 	 most 	 	to	the	moment	of	the	big	bang	 it 	 self 	 	.
we	can	see	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	spectrum	of	light	,	 reveal 	 ing 	 	 world 	 s 	 	that	had	 previous 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	.
we	see	these	 magnific 	 ent 	 	star	 nurse 	 ries 	 	,	where	nature	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 how 	 	 arrange 	 d 	 	for	just	the	right	 number 	 s 	 	and	just	the	right	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	to	be	born	for	life	to	arise	.
we	see	alien	 world 	 s 	 	,	we	see	alien	solar	 system 	 s 	 	--	300	now	,	and	still	 count 	 ing 	 	--	and	they	're	not	like	us	.
we	see	black	 hole 	 s 	 	at	the	heart	of	our	 galax 	 y 	 	,	in	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	,	and	 else 	 where 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	where	time	 it 	 self 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	stand	still	.
but	 un 	 til 	 	now	,	our	view	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	and	 fragment 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	think	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 marvel 	 ous 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	that	nature	 ha 	 s 	 	to	tell	us	have	 fall 	 en 	 	through	the	 crack 	 s 	 	.	and	that	's	changing	.
i	want	to	just	 brief 	 ly 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 	three	 reason 	 s 	 	why	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	and	i	,	in	 astro 	 nomy 	 	and	in	education	,	are	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	the	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	and	why	we	think	it	's	 tru 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ative 	 	.
first	,	it	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	you	to	experience	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	:	the	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	for	me	,	is	a	kind	of	magic	carpet	that	lets	you	 navig 	 ate 	 	through	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	where	you	want	to	go	.
second	:	you	can	tour	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	with	 astronomer 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	your	 guide 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	here	about	just	 expert 	 s 	 	who	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	people	who	are	passionate	about	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 nook 	 s 	 	and	 crann 	 ies 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	who	can	share	 the 	 ir 	 	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	and	can	make	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	a	 wel 	 coming 	 	place	.
and	third	,	you	can	create	your	own	 tour 	 s 	 	--	you	can	share	them	with	 friend 	 s 	 	,	you	can	create	them	with	 friend 	 s 	 	--	and	that	's	the	part	that	i	think	i	'm	most	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	that	at	heart	,	we	are	all	 story 	 teller 	 s 	 	.
and	in	 tell 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	each	of	us	is	going	to	understand	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	in	our	own	way	.
we	're	going	to	have	a	personal	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
i	think	we	're	going	to	see	a	community	of	 story 	 teller 	 s 	 	evolve	and	emerge	.
before	i	 introduc 	 e 	 	the	person	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	the	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	i	just	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	brief	thought	:	when	i	ask	people	,	``	how	 do 	 es 	 	the	night	sky	make	you	feel	?	``
they	often	say	,	``	oh	,	 tin 	 y 	 	.	i	feel	 tin 	 y 	 	and	 in 	 significant 	 	.	``
well	,	our	 gaz 	 e 	 	 fill 	 s 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	 creator 	 s 	 	of	the	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	we	can	now	start	to	have	a	 dial 	 ogue 	 	with	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
i	think	the	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	will	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	we	may	be	 tin 	 y 	 	,	but	we	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	 wonder 	 fully 	 	significant	.
thank	you	.
i	ca	n't	tell	you	what	a	privilege	it	is	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	curtis	wong	from	 micro 	 soft 	 	.
curtis	wong	:	thank	you	,	roy	.
so	,	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	,	but	it	's	one	of	the	 tour 	 s 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tour	is	one	that	was	 create 	 d 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
and	the	 tour 	 s 	 	are	all	 total 	 ly 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	,	so	that	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	go	 some 	 where 	 	...
you	may	be	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	tour	and	you	can	pause	 any 	 where 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	,	pull	up	other	information	--	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	web	and	information	 source 	 s 	 	about	 place 	 s 	 	you	might	want	to	go	--	you	can	zoom	in	,	you	can	pull	back	out	.
the	whole	 resource 	 s 	 	are	there	 avail 	 able 	 	for	you	.
so	,	 micro 	 soft 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	that	--	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	is	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	jim	gray	,	who	's	our	 col 	 league 	 	,	and	a	lot	of	his	work	that	he	did	is	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	possible	.
it	's	a	labor	of	love	for	us	and	our	small	team	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	it	will	inspire	 kid 	 s 	 	to	explore	and	learn	about	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 kid 	 s 	 	of	all	 age 	 s 	 	,	like	us	.
and	so	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	will	be	 avail 	 able 	 	 th 	 is 	 	spring	.
it	'll	be	a	free	download	--	thank	you	,	craig	mundie	--	and	it	'll	be	 avail 	 able 	 	at	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	worldwidetelescope.org	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
and	so	,	what	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	less	than	a	fraction	of	one	percent	of	what	is	in	here	,	and	in	the	ted	lab	,	we	have	a	tour	that	was	 create 	 d 	 	by	a	six	-	year	-	old	named	benjamin	that	will	knock	your	 sock 	 s 	 	off	.
so	we	'll	see	you	there	.	thank	you	.
