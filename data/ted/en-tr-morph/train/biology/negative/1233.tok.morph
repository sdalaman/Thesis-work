i	was	born	in	switzerland	and	raised	in	ghana	,	west	africa	.
ghana	felt	safe	to	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	.
i	was	free	,	i	was	happy	.
the	early	70s	 mark 	 ed 	 	a	time	of	musical	and	 art 	 istic 	 	excellence	in	ghana	.
but	then	by	the	end	of	the	decade	,	the	country	had	 fall 	 en 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 in 	 st 	 ability 	 	and	 mis 	 management 	 	.
in	1979	,	i	 witness 	 ed 	 	my	first	 militar 	 y 	 	coup	.
we	the	children	had	 gather 	 ed 	 	at	a	friend	's	house	.
it	was	a	 d 	 im 	 ly 	 	lit	 s 	 hack 	 	.
there	was	a	 beat 	 en 	 	up	black	and	white	 tele 	 vision 	 	 flick 	 er 	 ing 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	and	a	 form 	 er 	 	head	of	state	and	general	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 blind 	 fold 	 ed 	 	and	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	the	pole	.
the	 fir 	 ing 	 	 s 	 quad 	 	 aim 	 ed 	 	,	 fire 	 d 	 	--	the	general	was	dead	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 	live	.
and	 short 	 ly 	 	after	,	we	left	the	country	,	and	we	 return 	 ed 	 	to	switzerland	.
now	europe	came	 a 	 s 	 	a	shock	to	me	,	and	i	think	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	need	to	shed	my	skin	in	order	to	fit	in	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	blend	in	like	a	 cha 	 mel 	 eon 	 	.
i	think	it	was	a	tactic	of	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
and	it	 work 	 ed 	 	,	or	so	i	 believ 	 ed 	 	.
so	here	i	was	in	2008	 wonder 	 ing 	 	where	i	was	in	my	life	.
and	i	felt	i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 type 	 cast 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	the	 ex 	 otic 	 	african	.
i	was	 play 	 ing 	 	the	violent	african	,	the	african	terrorist	.
and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 terrorist 	 s 	 	could	i	possibly	play	before	 turn 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	 my 	 self 	 	?
and	i	had	 be 	 come 	 	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	of	the	other	,	the	african	in	me	.
and	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	i	 decide 	 d 	 	in	2008	to	return	to	ghana	,	after	28	 year 	 s 	 	of	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	document	on	film	the	2008	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 election 	 s 	 	.
and	there	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	by	 search 	 ing 	 	for	the	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	in	my	 child 	 hood 	 	.
and	before	i	even	 k 	 new 	 	it	,	i	was	 sudden 	 ly 	 	on	a	stage	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 cheer 	 ing 	 	people	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	 r 	 ally 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	when	i	'd	left	the	country	,	free	and	fair	 election 	 s 	 	in	a	 democrat 	 ic 	 	environment	 we 	 re 	 	a	dream	.
and	now	that	i	'd	 return 	 ed 	 	,	that	dream	had	 be 	 come 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	a	fragile	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	was	ghana	 search 	 ing 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	like	i	was	looking	for	my	 ident 	 ity 	 	?
was	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	ghana	a	metaphor	for	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	me	?
and	it	was	 a 	 s 	 	if	through	the	 standard 	 s 	 	of	my	western	life	,	i	had	n't	lived	up	to	my	full	potential	.
i	mean	,	nor	had	ghana	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	had	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
now	in	1957	,	ghana	was	the	first	sub	-	saharan	country	to	gain	 it 	 s 	 	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	.
in	the	late	50s	,	ghana	and	singapore	had	the	same	gdp	.
i	mean	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	singapore	is	a	first	world	country	and	ghana	is	not	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	time	to	prove	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	the	past	,	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	look	at	it	in	a	different	light	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	look	at	the	 strength 	 s 	 	in	our	own	culture	and	build	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 found 	 ations 	 	in	the	present	.
so	here	i	was	,	december	7th	,	2008	.
the	 poll 	 ing 	 	 station 	 s 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	to	the	 vot 	 ers 	 	at	7:00	am	,	but	 vot 	 ers 	 	,	eager	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 politic 	 al 	 	fate	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	line	up	at	4:00	am	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	had	 travel 	 ed 	 	from	near	,	they	had	 travel 	 ed 	 	from	far	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	heard	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	 vot 	 ers 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	whom	are	you	going	to	vote	for	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	sorry	,	i	ca	n't	tell	you	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	his	vote	was	in	his	heart	.
and	i	 under 	 stood 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 the 	 ir 	 	election	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	let	 any 	 one 	 	take	it	away	from	them	.
now	the	first	round	of	the	 vot 	 ing 	 	did	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	forth	a	clear	winner	--	so	 no 	 body 	 	had	 achiev 	 ed 	 	the	absolute	 major 	 ity 	 	--	so	 vot 	 ing 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	a	second	round	three	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
the	 candid 	 ates 	 	 we 	 re 	 	back	on	the	road	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 campaign 	 ing 	 	.
the	rhetoric	of	the	 candid 	 ates 	 	,	of	course	,	 change 	 d 	 	.
the	heat	was	on	.
and	then	the	cliche	came	to	haunt	us	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 claim 	 s 	 	of	 intimid 	 ation 	 	at	the	 poll 	 ing 	 	 station 	 s 	 	,	of	 ball 	 ot 	 	boxes	 be 	 ing 	 	 stole 	 n 	 	.
inflated	 result 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	coming	in	and	the	mob	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	out	of	control	.
we	 witness 	 ed 	 	the	 erupt 	 ion 	 	of	violence	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	 brutal 	 ly 	 	.
the	 arm 	 y 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 fir 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 gun 	 s 	 	.	people	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 cram 	 bling 	 	.
it	was	complete	 cha 	 os 	 	.
and	my	heart	 s 	 an 	 k 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	,	here	we	are	 aga 	 in 	 	.
here	is	 an 	 other 	 	proof	that	the	african	is	not	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 govern 	 ing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	i	am	 document 	 ing 	 	it	--	 document 	 ing 	 	my	own	cultural	 short 	 coming 	 s 	 	.
so	when	the	echo	of	the	 gun 	 shot 	 s 	 	had	 linger 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	soon	 drown 	 ed 	 	by	the	 chant 	 ing 	 	of	the	mob	,	and	i	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	what	i	was	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 chant 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	want	peace	.
we	want	peace	.	``
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	it	had	to	come	from	the	people	.
after	all	,	they	decide	,	and	they	did	.
so	the	 sound 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	before	 distort 	 ed 	 	and	loud	,	 we 	 re 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	a	 melo 	 dy 	 	.
the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	the	 voice 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 harmon 	 ious 	 	.
so	it	could	happen	.
a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	could	be	 up 	 held 	 	 peace 	 fully 	 	.
it	could	be	,	by	the	will	of	the	 masse 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	now	 urge 	 nt 	 ly 	 	 press 	 ing 	 	with	all	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	and	all	 the 	 ir 	 	will	for	peace	.
now	here	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 compar 	 ison 	 	.
we	in	the	west	,	we	preach	the	 value 	 s 	 	,	the	 gold 	 en 	 	light	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	that	we	are	the	 shin 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	.
but	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	it	,	ghana	found	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	same	place	in	which	the	u.s.	election	 stall 	 ed 	 	in	the	2000	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 election 	 s 	 	--	but	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	 un 	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	of	the	 candid 	 ates 	 	to	allow	the	system	to	proceed	and	the	people	to	decide	,	ghana	 honor 	 ed 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	people	.
it	did	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	it	up	to	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	to	decide	;	the	people	did	.
now	the	second	round	of	 vot 	 ing 	 	did	not	 br 	 ing 	 	forth	a	clear	winner	either	.
i	mean	,	it	was	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	close	.
the	 elect 	 or 	 al 	 	 commission 	 er 	 	 declare 	 d 	 	,	with	the	consent	of	the	 part 	 ies 	 	,	to	run	an	unprecedented	second	re	-	run	.
so	the	people	went	back	to	the	 poll 	 s 	 	to	determine	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 p 	 resident 	 	,	not	the	legal	system	.
and	guess	what	,	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.
the	 defeat 	 ed 	 	 candid 	 ate 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	up	power	and	made	way	for	ghana	to	move	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	 democrat 	 ic 	 	cycle	.
i	mean	,	at	the	absolute	time	for	the	absolute	need	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	they	did	not	abuse	 the 	 ir 	 	power	.
the	belief	in	true	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	in	the	people	 run 	 s 	 	deep	,	 prov 	 ing 	 	that	the	african	is	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 govern 	 ing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
now	the	 up 	 hill 	 	battle	for	ghana	and	for	africa	is	not	over	,	but	i	have	proof	that	the	other	side	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	,	and	that	we	must	not	take	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
now	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	my	place	is	not	just	in	the	west	or	in	africa	,	and	i	'm	still	 search 	 ing 	 	for	my	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	but	i	saw	ghana	create	 demo 	 cracy 	 	better	.
ghana	taught	me	to	look	at	people	 different 	 ly 	 	and	to	look	at	 my 	 self 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	africans	can	.
thank	you	.
