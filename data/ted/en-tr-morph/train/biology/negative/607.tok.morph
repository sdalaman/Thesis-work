well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	2009	.
and	it	's	the	bicentenary	of	charles	darwin	.
and	all	over	the	world	,	eminent	 evolution 	 ists 	 	are	 anx 	 ious 	 	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	what	they	're	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	do	is	to	enlighten	us	on	 al 	 most 	 	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	darwin	and	his	life	,	and	how	he	 change 	 d 	 	our	 think 	 ing 	 	.
i	say	 al 	 most 	 	every	 a 	 spect 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	one	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	story	which	they	have	 throw 	 n 	 	no	light	on	.
and	they	seem	 anx 	 ious 	 	to	skirt	around	it	and	step	over	it	and	to	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
so	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	it	.
it	's	the	question	of	,	why	are	we	so	different	from	the	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	?
we	get	the	 genetic 	 ists 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	on	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	how	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	we	are	related	--	 hard 	 ly 	 	any	 gene 	 s 	 	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	related	.
and	yet	,	when	you	look	at	the	 pheno 	 type 	 s 	 	,	there	's	a	chimp	,	there	's	a	man	;	they	're	 astound 	 ing 	 ly 	 	different	,	no	 re 	 semblance 	 	at	all	.
i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	airy	-	 fair 	 y 	 	stuff	about	culture	or	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	or	behavior	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	ground	-	base	,	nitty	-	 grit 	 ty 	 	,	 measur 	 able 	 	physical	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
they	,	that	one	,	is	 hair 	 y 	 	and	 walk 	 ing 	 	on	four	 leg 	 s 	 	.
that	one	is	a	naked	 bi 	 ped 	 	.	why	?
i	mean	--	if	i	'm	a	good	darwinist	,	i	've	got	to	 believ 	 e 	 	there	's	a	reason	for	that	.
if	we	 change 	 d 	 	so	much	,	 some 	 thing 	 	must	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
now	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	was	a	 laugh 	 ably 	 	simple	question	.
 every 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	the	answer	.
they	 k 	 new 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
the	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	the	 ape 	 s 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	in	the	 tree 	 s 	 	;	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	went	out	onto	the	plain	.
that	 explain 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
we	had	to	get	up	on	our	 leg 	 s 	 	to	peer	over	the	tall	grass	,	or	to	chase	after	 animal 	 s 	 	,	or	to	free	our	 hand 	 s 	 	for	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
and	we	got	so	 over 	 heated 	 	in	the	chase	that	we	had	to	take	off	that	fur	coat	and	throw	it	away	.
 every 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	that	,	for	 generation 	 s 	 	.
but	then	,	in	the	'90s	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	unravel	.
the	 paleonto 	 logists 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	a	bit	more	 close 	 ly 	 	at	the	 ac 	 company 	 ing 	 	 micro 	 fauna 	 	that	lived	in	the	same	time	and	place	 a 	 s 	 	the	 hominid 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	savanna	species	.
and	they	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 herb 	 ivores 	 	.	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	savanna	 herb 	 ivores 	 	.
and	then	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	clever	,	they	found	a	way	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	 fossil 	 ized 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	.
shock	,	 horr 	 or 	 	.
the	 fossil 	 ized 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	was	not	of	savanna	 veget 	 ation 	 	.
some	of	it	even	came	from	 lian 	 a 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 d 	 angle 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	jungle	.
so	we	're	left	with	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	we	know	that	our	 ear 	 liest 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	moving	around	on	four	 leg 	 s 	 	in	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	before	the	savanna	 eco 	 system 	 	even	came	 in 	 to 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	i	've	made	up	.
it	's	not	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	with	it	.
professor	tobias	came	over	from	south	africa	and	spoke	to	university	college	london	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 every 	 thing 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	for	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	forget	about	it	.	it	was	wrong	.
we	've	got	to	go	back	to	square	one	and	start	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
it	made	him	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 popular 	 	.	they	did	n't	want	to	go	back	to	square	one	.
i	mean	,	it	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	to	happen	.
you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	paradigm	.
you	've	 believ 	 ed 	 	it	through	 generation 	 s 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 question 	 ed 	 	it	.
you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 construct 	 ing 	 	 fanci 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	top	of	it	,	 re 	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	it	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	solid	 a 	 s 	 	a	rock	.
and	now	it	's	 whip 	 ped 	 	away	from	under	you	.
what	do	you	do	?	what	 do 	 es 	 	a	scientist	do	in	that	case	?
well	,	we	know	the	answer	 be 	 cause 	 	thomas	s.	kuhn	wrote	a	 semi 	 nal 	 	 treat 	 ise 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	back	in	1962	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	what	 scientist 	 s 	 	do	when	a	paradigm	 fail 	 s 	 	is	,	guess	what	--	they	carry	on	 a 	 s 	 	if	 noth 	 ing 	 	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
if	they	have	n't	got	a	paradigm	they	ca	n't	ask	the	question	.
so	they	say	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	it	's	wrong	,	but	 s 	 up 	 posing 	 	it	was	right	.	.	.	``
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	other	option	open	to	them	is	to	stop	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	 question 	 s 	 	.
so	that	is	what	they	have	 d 	 one 	 	now	.
that	's	why	you	do	n't	hear	them	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	.	it	's	 yester 	 day 	 	's	question	.
some	of	them	have	even	 elev 	 ated 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	principle	.
it	's	what	we	ought	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	.
aaron	 fill 	 er 	 	from	harvard	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	is	n't	it	time	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 select 	 ive 	 	 pressure 	 s 	 	?
i	mean	,	why	do	n't	we	talk	about	,	well	,	there	's	 chromosom 	 es 	 	,	and	there	's	 gene 	 s 	 	.
and	we	just	record	what	we	see	.	``
charles	darwin	must	be	 s 	 pinning 	 	in	his	grave	!
he	 k 	 new 	 	all	about	that	kind	of	science	.
and	he	 call 	 ed 	 	it	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	-	free	science	.
and	he	 despis 	 ed 	 	it	from	the	bottom	of	his	heart	.
and	if	you	're	going	to	say	,	``	i	'm	going	to	stop	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 select 	 ive 	 	 pressure 	 s 	 	,	``	you	can	take	``	the	origin	of	species	``	and	throw	it	out	of	the	window	,	for	it	's	about	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	but	 select 	 ive 	 	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 iron 	 y 	 	of	it	is	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	occasion	of	a	paradigm	collapse	where	we	did	n't	have	to	wait	for	a	new	paradigm	to	come	up	.
there	was	one	 wait 	 ing 	 	in	the	 wing 	 s 	 	.
it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	there	since	1960	when	alister	 hard 	 y 	 	,	a	marine	biologist	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	think	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	had	a	more	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	for	some	of	the	time	.	``
he	 ke 	 pt 	 	it	to	 him 	 self 	 	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	then	the	press	got	hold	of	it	and	all	hell	broke	loose	.
all	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	.
you	've	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	us	to	public	 ridicul 	 e 	 	!
you	must	never	do	that	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
and	at	that	time	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	set	in	stone	:	the	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	should	be	 dump 	 ed 	 	with	the	ufos	and	the	 yeti 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	 lun 	 atic 	 	fringe	of	science	.
well	i	do	n't	think	that	.
i	think	that	 hard 	 y 	 	had	a	lot	going	for	him	.
i	'd	like	to	talk	about	just	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	what	have	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 hall 	 mark 	 s 	 	of	 man 	 kind 	 	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	made	us	different	from	 every 	 body 	 	else	,	and	all	our	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
let	's	look	at	our	naked	skin	.
it	's	obvious	that	most	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	think	about	that	have	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	body	hair	,	 mammal 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	body	hair	,	are	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 du 	 gong 	 	,	the	 wal 	 rus 	 	,	the	dolphin	,	the	 hippo 	 pot 	 a 	 mus 	 	,	the	 man 	 ate 	 e 	 	.
and	a	couple	of	wallowers	-	in	-	mud	like	the	 bab 	 irusa 	 	.
and	you	're	 tempt 	 ed 	 	to	think	,	well	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	could	that	be	why	we	are	naked	?
i	 suggest 	 ed 	 	it	and	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	no	no	.
i	mean	,	look	at	the	elephant	.
you	've	 for 	 gotten 	 	all	about	the	elephant	have	n't	you	?	``
so	back	in	1982	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	elephant	had	an	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	.	``
peals	of	merry	laughter	!
``	that	crazy	woman	.	she	's	off	 aga 	 in 	 	.	she	'll	say	 any 	 thing 	 	wo	n't	she	?	``
but	by	now	,	 every 	 body 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	that	the	elephant	had	an	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	'	round	to	be	that	all	 t 	 hose 	 	naked	pachyderms	have	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	.
the	last	exception	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	the	 rhino 	 ce 	 ros 	 	.
last	year	in	florida	they	found	extinct	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	a	 rhino 	 ce 	 ros 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	 s 	 pent 	 	most	of	 it 	 s 	 	time	in	the	water	.	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	close	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	 naked 	 ness 	 	and	water	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	absolute	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	one	way	.
you	ca	n't	say	all	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	are	naked	,	 be 	 cause 	 	look	at	the	sea	 ot 	 ter 	 	.
but	you	can	say	that	every	animal	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	naked	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 condition 	 ed 	 	by	water	,	in	 it 	 s 	 	own	 life 	 time 	 	,	or	the	 life 	 time 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	.	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	significant	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	exception	is	the	naked	somalian	mole	-	rat	,	which	never	 put 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	nose	above	the	surface	of	the	ground	.
and	take	 bipedal 	 ity 	 	.
here	you	ca	n't	find	 any 	 body 	 	to	 compar 	 e 	 	it	with	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	the	 on 	 ly 	 	animal	that	 walk 	 s 	 	 up 	 right 	 	on	two	 leg 	 s 	 	.
but	you	can	say	 th 	 is 	 	:	all	the	 ape 	 s 	 	and	all	the	 monkey 	 s 	 	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	on	two	 leg 	 s 	 	,	if	they	want	to	,	for	a	short	time	.
there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 circum 	 stance 	 	in	which	they	 al 	 ways 	 	,	all	of	them	,	walk	on	two	 leg 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	when	they	are	 wa 	 d 	 ing 	 	through	water	.
do	you	think	that	's	significant	?
david	attenborough	 think 	 s 	 	it	's	significant	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	possible	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	our	 bipedal 	 ism 	 	.
look	at	the	fat	layer	.
we	have	got	,	under	our	skin	,	a	layer	of	fat	,	all	over	:	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	the	 l 	 east 	 	like	that	in	any	other	 prim 	 ate 	 	.
why	should	it	be	there	?
well	they	do	know	,	that	if	you	look	at	other	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 mammal 	 s 	 	,	the	fat	that	in	most	land	 mammal 	 s 	 	is	 deposit 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	body	wall	,	around	the	 kid 	 ney 	 s 	 	and	the	 intestine 	 s 	 	and	so	on	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 migr 	 ate 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	spread	out	in	a	layer	 in 	 side 	 	the	skin	.
in	the	whale	it	's	complete	:	no	fat	 in 	 side 	 	at	all	,	all	in	 blu 	 b 	 ber 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
we	can	not	avoid	the	 s 	 us 	 pic 	 ion 	 	that	in	our	case	it	's	 start 	 ed 	 	to	happen	.
we	have	got	skin	lined	with	 th 	 is 	 	layer	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	possible	 explan 	 ation 	 	of	why	 human 	 s 	 	,	if	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 luck 	 y 	 	,	can	 be 	 come 	 	 gross 	 ly 	 	 obes 	 e 	 	,	in	a	way	that	would	be	 total 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	for	any	other	 prim 	 ate 	 	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	odd	,	matter	-	of	-	 fact 	 ly 	 	,	never	 explain 	 ed 	 	.
the	question	of	why	we	can	speak	.
we	can	speak	.
and	the	gorilla	ca	n't	speak	.	why	?
 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	his	 tee 	 th 	 	or	his	tongue	or	his	 lung 	 s 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	--	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 it 	 s 	 	conscious	control	of	 it 	 s 	 	breath	.
you	ca	n't	even	train	a	gorilla	to	say	``	ah	``	on	request	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	that	have	got	conscious	control	of	 the 	 ir 	 	breath	are	the	 div 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	and	the	 div 	 ing 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	.
it	was	an	absolute	 pre 	 condition 	 	for	our	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	speak	.
and	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	there	is	the	fact	that	we	are	 stream 	 lined 	 	.
 try 	 ing 	 	to	imagine	a	 div 	 er 	 	 div 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	water	--	 hard 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	splash	.
try	to	imagine	a	gorilla	 perform 	 ing 	 	the	same	maneuver	,	and	you	can	see	that	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	gorilla	,	we	are	 half 	 way 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	shaped	like	a	fish	.
i	am	 try 	 ing 	 	to	suggest	that	,	for	40	-	odd	 year 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 aqua 	 tic 	 	idea	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 mis 	 categor 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 lun 	 atic 	 	fringe	,	and	it	is	not	 lun 	 atic 	 	fringe	.
and	the	 iron 	 ic 	 	thing	about	it	is	that	they	are	not	 stav 	 ing 	 	off	the	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	to	protect	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	,	which	they	've	all	 agree 	 d 	 	on	,	and	they	love	.
there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	there	.
they	are	 stav 	 ing 	 	off	the	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	to	protect	a	vacuum	.
how	do	they	react	when	i	say	these	 thing 	 s 	 	?
one	 ver 	 y 	 	common	 re 	 action 	 	i	've	heard	about	20	 time 	 s 	 	is	,	``	but	it	was	 investigate 	 d 	 	.
they	 conduct 	 ed 	 	a	serious	investigation	of	 th 	 is 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	when	 hard 	 y 	 	put	forward	his	article	.	``
i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	.
for	35	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	for	any	evidence	of	any	incident	of	that	kind	,	and	i	've	 conclude 	 d 	 	that	that	's	one	of	the	urban	 myth 	 s 	 	.
it	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
i	ask	people	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	they	say	,	``	i	like	the	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	!
 every 	 body 	 	 like 	 s 	 	the	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
of	course	they	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	but	they	like	it	.	``
well	i	say	,	``	why	do	you	think	it	's	 rub 	 b 	 ish 	 	?	``
they	say	``	well	...
 every 	 body 	 	i	talk	to	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	 rub 	 b 	 ish 	 	.
and	they	ca	n't	all	be	wrong	,	can	they	?	``
the	answer	to	that	,	loud	and	clear	,	is	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	!	they	can	all	be	wrong	.	``
 histo 	 ry 	 	is	strewn	with	the	 case 	 s 	 	when	they	've	all	got	it	wrong	.
and	if	you	've	got	a	scientific	problem	like	that	,	you	ca	n't	solve	it	by	 hold 	 ing 	 	a	head	count	,	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	more	of	us	say	 y 	 es 	 	than	say	no.	``
 a 	 part 	 	from	that	,	some	of	the	 head 	 s 	 	count	more	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
some	of	them	have	come	over	.
there	was	professor	tobias	.	he	's	come	over	.
daniel	dennett	,	he	's	come	over	.
 s 	 ir 	 	david	attenborough	,	he	's	come	over	.
 any 	 body 	 	else	out	there	?	come	on	in	.
the	water	is	 love 	 ly 	 	.
and	now	we	've	got	to	look	to	the	future	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	one	of	three	 thing 	 s 	 	is	going	to	happen	.
either	they	will	go	on	for	the	next	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	60	 year 	 s 	 	.
``	 yea 	 h 	 	well	we	do	n't	talk	about	that	.	let	's	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	``
that	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	.
the	second	thing	that	could	happen	is	that	some	young	 gen 	 ius 	 	will	 arriv 	 e 	 	,	and	say	,	``	i	've	found	it	.
it	was	not	the	savanna	,	it	was	not	the	water	,	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	!	``
no	sign	of	that	 happen 	 ing 	 	either	.
i	do	n't	think	there	is	a	third	option	.
so	the	third	thing	that	might	happen	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	.
if	you	look	back	at	the	early	 year 	 s 	 	of	the	last	century	,	there	was	a	stand	-	off	,	a	lot	of	 bi 	 cker 	 ing 	 	and	bad	 feel 	 ing 	 	between	the	 believ 	 ers 	 	in	mendel	,	and	the	 believ 	 ers 	 	in	darwin	.
it	 end 	 ed 	 	with	a	new	synthesis	:	darwin	's	 idea 	 s 	 	and	mendel	's	 idea 	 s 	 	 blend 	 ing 	 	together	.
and	i	think	the	same	thing	will	happen	here	.
you	'll	get	a	new	synthesis	.
 hard 	 y 	 	's	 idea 	 s 	 	and	darwin	's	 idea 	 s 	 	will	be	 blend 	 ed 	 	together	.
and	we	can	move	forward	from	there	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	get	 some 	 where 	 	.
that	would	be	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	.
it	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	for	me	if	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	soon	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 old 	 er 	 	now	than	george	 burn 	 s 	 	was	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	at	my	age	,	i	do	n't	even	buy	green	 banana 	 s 	 	.	``
so	if	it	's	going	to	come	and	it	's	going	to	happen	,	what	's	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	up	?
i	can	tell	you	that	in	three	 word 	 s 	 	.
academia	 say 	 s 	 	no	.
``	that	 belong 	 s 	 	with	the	ufos	and	the	 yeti 	 s 	 	.	``
and	it	's	not	easy	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	.
the	professional	 journal 	 s 	 	wo	n't	touch	it	with	a	 bar 	 ge 	 	pole	.
the	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	do	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	it	.
the	syllabus	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	even	the	fact	that	we	're	naked	,	let	 al 	 one 	 	look	for	a	reason	to	it	.
``	horizon	,	``	which	 take 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	cue	from	the	 academic 	 s 	 	,	wo	n't	touch	it	with	a	 bar 	 ge 	 	pole	.
so	we	never	hear	the	case	put	for	it	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	in	 jo 	 cular 	 	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	to	people	on	the	 lun 	 atic 	 	fringe	.
i	do	n't	know	 quit 	 e 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	diktat	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
 some 	 body 	 	up	there	is	 is 	 suing 	 	the	 command 	 ment 	 	,	``	 th 	 ou 	 	 s 	 halt 	 	not	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
and	if	you	hope	to	make	progress	in	 th 	 is 	 	profession	,	and	you	do	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	you	'd	better	keep	it	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	get	in	your	way	.	``
so	i	get	the	impression	that	some	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	scientific	 establish 	 ment 	 	are	 morph 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	 priest 	 hood 	 	.
but	you	know	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	feel	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	richard	dawkins	 ha 	 s 	 	told	us	how	to	treat	a	 priest 	 hood 	 	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 first 	 ly 	 	,	you	've	got	to	 re 	 fuse 	 	to	give	it	all	the	 excess 	 ive 	 	awe	and	reverence	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	trained	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	.	``
right	.	i	'll	go	 a 	 head 	 	with	that	.
and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	must	never	be	 af 	 raid 	 	to	rock	the	boat	.	``
i	'll	go	 a 	 long 	 	with	that	too	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
