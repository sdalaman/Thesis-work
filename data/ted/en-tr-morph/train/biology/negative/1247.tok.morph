so	i	'm	here	to	explain	why	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	these	 n 	 in 	 ja 	 	 pajama 	 s 	 	.
and	to	do	that	,	i	'd	like	to	talk	first	about	 environment 	 al 	 	 toxin 	 s 	 	in	our	bodies	.
so	some	of	you	may	know	about	the	chemical	bisphenol	a	,	bpa	.
it	's	a	material	 hard 	 en 	 er 	 	and	synthetic	estrogen	that	's	found	in	the	lining	of	 can 	 ned 	 	 food 	 s 	 	and	some	 plastic 	 s 	 	.
so	bpa	 mimic 	 s 	 	the	body	's	own	 hormone 	 s 	 	and	 cause 	 s 	 	 neuro 	 logical 	 	and	 re 	 productive 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 every 	 where 	 	.
a	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	found	bpa	in	93	percent	of	people	six	and	 old 	 er 	 	.
but	it	's	just	one	chemical	.
the	center	for	disease	control	in	the	u.s	.
 say 	 s 	 	we	have	219	toxic	 pollutant 	 s 	 	in	our	bodies	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 include 	 s 	 	 pre 	 serv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	and	heavy	 metal 	 s 	 	like	lead	and	 merc 	 ury 	 	.
to	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	 say 	 s 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	,	do	n't	 be 	 come 	 	a	cannibal	.
second	,	we	are	both	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	and	the	 victim 	 s 	 	of	our	own	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
and	third	,	our	bodies	are	 filter 	 s 	 	and	 store 	 house 	 s 	 	for	 environment 	 al 	 	 toxin 	 s 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	all	these	 toxin 	 s 	 	when	we	die	?
the	short	answer	is	:	they	return	to	the	environment	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	 continu 	 ing 	 	the	cycle	of	 toxic 	 ity 	 	.
but	our	current	funeral	 practice 	 s 	 	make	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
if	you	're	 crem 	 ated 	 	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 toxin 	 s 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	are	released	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 include 	 s 	 	5,000	 pound 	 s 	 	of	 merc 	 ury 	 	from	our	 dent 	 al 	 	 fill 	 ing 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	every	year	.
and	in	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	american	funeral	,	a	dead	body	is	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	 fill 	 ers 	 	and	 cosmetic 	 s 	 	to	make	it	look	 al 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	then	 pump 	 ed 	 	with	toxic	 form 	 aldehyde 	 	to	 s 	 low 	 	 de 	 com 	 position 	 	--	a	practice	which	 cause 	 s 	 	 respirator 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	and	cancer	so	by	 try 	 ing 	 	to	preserve	our	dead	bodies	,	we	 den 	 y 	 	death	,	poison	the	living	and	further	harm	the	environment	.
green	or	natural	 burial 	 s 	 	,	which	do	n't	use	 em 	 balm 	 ing 	 	,	are	a	step	in	the	right	direction	,	but	they	do	n't	address	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 toxin 	 s 	 	in	our	bodies	.
i	think	there	's	a	better	solution	.
i	'm	an	artist	,	so	i	'd	like	to	 off 	 er 	 	a	modest	proposal	at	the	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	art	,	science	and	culture	.
the	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	burial	project	,	an	 alter 	 native 	 	burial	system	that	uses	 mushroom 	 s 	 	to	 de 	 compose 	 	and	clean	 toxin 	 s 	 	in	bodies	.
the	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	burial	project	 beg 	 an 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	with	a	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	to	create	the	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	mushroom	--	a	new	hybrid	mushroom	that	would	 de 	 compose 	 	bodies	,	clean	the	 toxin 	 s 	 	and	deliver	 nutrient 	 s 	 	to	plant	 root 	 s 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	clean	 com 	 post 	 	.
but	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	it	's	 near 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	create	a	new	hybrid	mushroom	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	some	of	our	 ta 	 s 	 tiest 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	can	clean	 environment 	 al 	 	 toxin 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 oil 	 	.
so	i	thought	 may 	 be 	 	i	could	train	an	 arm 	 y 	 	of	toxin	-	 clean 	 ing 	 	 ed 	 ible 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	to	eat	my	body	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	 collect 	 ing 	 	what	i	shed	or	 s 	 l 	 ough 	 	off	--	my	hair	,	skin	and	 nail 	 s 	 	--	and	i	'm	 feed 	 ing 	 	these	to	 ed 	 ible 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	 mushroom 	 s 	 	grow	,	i	pick	the	best	 feed 	 ers 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	kind	of	 im 	 print 	 ing 	 	and	 select 	 ive 	 	 breed 	 ing 	 	process	for	the	 after 	 life 	 	.
so	when	i	die	,	the	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	will	 recogn 	 ize 	 	my	body	and	be	able	to	eat	it	.
all	right	,	so	for	some	of	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	out	there	.
just	a	little	.
i	 real 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	kind	of	relationship	that	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	 aspir 	 e 	 	to	have	with	our	food	.
we	want	to	eat	,	not	be	eaten	by	,	our	food	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	i	watch	the	 mushroom 	 s 	 	grow	and	digest	my	body	,	i	imagine	the	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	mushroom	 a 	 s 	 	a	symbol	of	a	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	death	and	the	relationship	between	my	body	and	the	environment	.
see	for	me	,	 cultiv 	 ating 	 	the	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	mushroom	is	more	than	just	scientific	 experiment 	 ation 	 	or	 garden 	 ing 	 	or	raising	a	pet	,	it	's	a	step	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 accept 	 ing 	 	the	fact	that	 some 	 day 	 	i	will	die	and	decay	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	step	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	taking	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	my	own	burden	on	the	planet	.
growing	a	mushroom	is	 al 	 so 	 	part	of	a	 large 	 r 	 	practice	of	 cultiv 	 ating 	 	 de 	 com 	 posing 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 decompi 	 culture 	 	,	a	 con 	 cept 	 	that	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	an	 entomo 	 logist 	 	,	timothy	myles	.
the	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	mushroom	is	a	 sub 	 set 	 	of	 decompi 	 culture 	 	i	'm	 call 	 ing 	 	body	 decompi 	 culture 	 	and	toxin	 remedi 	 ation 	 	--	the	 cultiv 	 ation 	 	of	 organism 	 s 	 	that	 de 	 compose 	 	and	clean	 toxin 	 s 	 	in	bodies	.
and	now	about	these	 n 	 in 	 ja 	 	 pajama 	 s 	 	.
once	it	's	 complete 	 d 	 	,	i	plan	to	integrate	the	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	number	of	 object 	 s 	 	.
first	,	a	burial	suit	 in 	 fused 	 	with	mushroom	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	,	the	mushroom	death	suit	.
i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	the	second	prototype	of	 th 	 is 	 	burial	suit	.
it	's	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	a	 crochet 	 ed 	 	 nett 	 ing 	 	that	is	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	with	mushroom	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
the	 den 	 dritic 	 	pattern	you	see	 mimic 	 s 	 	the	growth	of	mushroom	 mycel 	 ia 	 	,	which	are	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	plant	 root 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	making	a	 decompi 	 culture 	 	kit	,	a	 cock 	 tail 	 	of	 cap 	 sule 	 s 	 	that	contain	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	mushroom	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	and	other	 element 	 s 	 	that	speed	 de 	 com 	 position 	 	and	toxin	 remedi 	 ation 	 	.
these	 cap 	 sule 	 s 	 	are	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	a	nutrient	-	rich	jelly	,	a	kind	of	second	skin	,	which	 dis 	 solve 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	and	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	baby	food	for	the	growing	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
so	i	plan	to	finish	the	mushroom	and	 decompi 	 culture 	 	kit	in	the	next	year	or	two	,	and	then	i	'd	like	to	begin	 test 	 ing 	 	them	,	first	with	 expir 	 ed 	 	meat	from	the	market	and	then	with	human	 subject 	 s 	 	.
and	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	a	few	people	have	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	 don 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	to	the	project	to	be	eaten	by	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
what	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	these	 folk 	 s 	 	is	that	we	share	a	common	 desir 	 e 	 	to	understand	and	accept	death	and	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	the	impact	of	our	death	on	the	environment	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	just	like	the	 mushroom 	 s 	 	,	so	i	 form 	 ed 	 	the	 decompi 	 culture 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	a	group	of	people	 call 	 ed 	 	 decompi 	 nauts 	 	who	 active 	 ly 	 	explore	 the 	 ir 	 	 post 	 mort 	 em 	 	 option 	 s 	 	,	seek	death	 accept 	 ance 	 	and	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	 de 	 com 	 posing 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	like	the	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	mushroom	.
the	 decompi 	 culture 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	 share 	 s 	 	a	vision	of	a	cultural	shift	,	from	our	current	culture	of	death	 deni 	 al 	 	and	body	 p 	 reservation 	 	to	one	of	 decompi 	 culture 	 	,	a	radical	 accept 	 ance 	 	of	death	and	 de 	 com 	 position 	 	.
 accept 	 ing 	 	death	 mean 	 s 	 	 accept 	 ing 	 	that	we	are	physical	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	who	are	 intima 	 te 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	environment	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	research	on	 environment 	 al 	 	 toxin 	 s 	 	 confirm 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 say 	 ing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	,	we	came	from	dust	and	will	return	to	dust	.
and	once	we	understand	that	we	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	environment	,	we	see	that	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	our	species	 depend 	 s 	 	on	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	the	planet	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	true	 environment 	 al 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
thank	you	.
