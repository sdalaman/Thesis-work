i	grew	up	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	brain	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	a	brother	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	a	brain	 dis 	 order 	 	:	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	sister	and	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	understand	,	why	is	it	that	i	can	take	my	 dream 	 s 	 	,	i	can	connect	them	to	my	 re 	 ality 	 	,	and	i	can	make	my	 dream 	 s 	 	come	true	?
what	is	it	about	my	brother	's	brain	and	his	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	that	he	can	not	connect	his	 dream 	 s 	 	to	a	common	and	 share 	 d 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	,	so	they	 in 	 stead 	 	 be 	 come 	 	delusion	?
so	i	 dedicate 	 d 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	to	research	 in 	 to 	 	the	severe	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	.	and	i	 move 	 d 	 	from	my	home	state	of	indiana	to	boston	,	where	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	lab	of	dr.	francine	benes	,	in	the	harvard	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	 psych 	 iatry 	 	.	and	in	the	lab	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	question	,	``	what	are	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	the	 brain 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	who	would	be	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	normal	control	,	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	the	 brain 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	,	 schizo 	 affect 	 ive 	 	or	 bi 	 polar 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	?	``
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	mapping	the	 micro 	 circuit 	 ry 	 	of	the	brain	:	which	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	with	which	 cell 	 s 	 	,	with	which	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	and	then	in	what	 quant 	 ities 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	?
so	there	was	a	lot	of	meaning	in	my	life	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 perform 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	research	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	.
but	then	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	on	the	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	,	i	 travel 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 advoc 	 ate 	 	for	nami	,	the	national	alliance	on	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
but	on	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	of	december	10	,	1996	,	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	to	discover	that	i	had	a	brain	 dis 	 order 	 	of	my	own	.
a	blood	vessel	 explode 	 d 	 	in	the	left	half	of	my	brain	.
and	in	the	course	of	four	 hour 	 s 	 	,	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	my	brain	 complete 	 ly 	 	 deterio 	 rate 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	ability	to	process	all	information	.	on	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	of	the	 hemorrh 	 age 	 	,	i	could	not	walk	,	talk	,	read	,	write	or	recall	any	of	my	life	.
i	 essential 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	an	infant	in	a	woman	's	body	.
if	you	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	a	human	brain	,	it	's	obvious	that	the	two	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	i	have	 br 	 ought 	 	for	you	a	real	human	brain	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	human	brain	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	front	of	the	brain	,	the	back	of	brain	with	the	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	 hang 	 ing 	 	down	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	would	be	 position 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	my	head	.
and	when	you	look	at	the	brain	,	it	's	obvious	that	the	two	cerebral	 cort 	 ice 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	understand	 computer 	 s 	 	,	our	right	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 function 	 s 	 	like	a	parallel	processor	,	while	our	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 function 	 s 	 	like	a	 s 	 erial 	 	processor	.
the	two	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	do	communicate	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	through	the	 corp 	 us 	 	 coll 	 o 	 sum 	 	,	which	is	made	up	of	some	300	million	 axon 	 al 	 	 fiber 	 s 	 	.
but	other	than	that	,	the	two	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	process	information	 different 	 ly 	 	,	each	of	our	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	think	about	different	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	care	about	different	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	,	 da 	 re 	 	i	say	,	they	have	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 personal 	 ities 	 	.
excuse	me	.	thank	you	.	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	joy	.	 assist 	 ant 	 	:	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
our	right	human	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	is	all	about	 th 	 is 	 	present	moment	.
it	's	all	about	``	right	here	,	right	now	.	``
our	right	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	it	 think 	 s 	 	in	 picture 	 s 	 	and	it	 learn 	 s 	 	 kinesthetic 	 ally 	 	through	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	our	bodies	.
information	,	in	the	form	of	energy	,	 stream 	 s 	 	in	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	through	all	of	our	 sensor 	 y 	 	 system 	 s 	 	and	then	it	 explode 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	enormous	collage	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	present	moment	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	present	moment	 smell 	 s 	 	like	and	 taste 	 s 	 	like	,	what	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	and	what	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	.
i	am	an	energy	-	 be 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	energy	all	around	me	through	the	 conscious 	 ness 	 	of	my	right	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	.
we	are	energy	-	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	through	the	 conscious 	 ness 	 	of	our	right	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	human	family	.
and	right	here	,	right	now	,	we	are	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	here	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	moment	we	are	perfect	,	we	are	whole	and	we	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
my	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	--	our	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	--	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	place	.
our	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 think 	 s 	 	 linear 	 ly 	 	and	 method 	 ically 	 	.
our	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	is	all	about	the	past	and	it	's	all	about	the	future	.
our	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	is	designed	to	take	that	enormous	collage	of	the	present	moment	and	start	 pick 	 ing 	 	out	 detail 	 s 	 	,	 detail 	 s 	 	and	more	 detail 	 s 	 	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	.
it	then	 categor 	 ize 	 s 	 	and	 organize 	 s 	 	all	that	information	,	 associate 	 s 	 	it	with	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	past	we	've	ever	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	and	 project 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	all	of	our	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
and	our	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 think 	 s 	 	in	language	.
it	's	that	 on 	 going 	 	brain	 chat 	 ter 	 	that	 connect 	 s 	 	me	and	my	internal	world	to	my	external	world	.
it	's	that	little	voice	that	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	got	ta	remember	to	pick	up	 banana 	 s 	 	on	your	way	home	.

it	's	that	 calcul 	 ating 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	that	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	when	i	have	to	do	my	 laundr 	 y 	 	.	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	it	's	that	little	voice	that	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	,	``	i	am	.	i	am.	``	and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	my	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	``	i	am	,	``	i	 be 	 come 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	.
i	 be 	 come 	 	a	single	solid	individual	,	 separat 	 e 	 	from	the	energy	flow	around	me	and	 separat 	 e 	 	from	you	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 port 	 ion 	 	of	my	brain	that	i	lost	on	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	of	my	stroke	.
on	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	of	the	stroke	,	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	to	a	 pound 	 ing 	 	pain	 be 	 hind 	 	my	left	eye	.	and	it	was	the	kind	of	pain	--	 caus 	 tic 	 	pain	--	that	you	get	when	you	bite	 in 	 to 	 	ice	cream	.	and	it	just	 grip 	 ped 	 	me	--	and	then	it	released	me	.	and	then	it	just	 grip 	 ped 	 	me	--	and	then	it	released	me	.	and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	for	me	to	ever	experience	any	kind	of	pain	,	so	i	thought	,	``	ok	,	i	'll	just	start	my	normal	routine	.	``
so	i	got	up	and	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	onto	my	cardio	glider	,	which	is	a	full	-	body	,	full	-	 exercis 	 e 	 	machine	.
and	i	'm	 jamm 	 ing 	 	away	on	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	and	i	'm	 real 	 izing 	 	that	my	 hand 	 s 	 	look	like	primitive	 claw 	 s 	 	 grasp 	 ing 	 	onto	the	bar	.	and	i	thought	,	``	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	peculiar	.	``
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	down	at	my	body	and	i	thought	,	``	 who 	 a 	 	,	i	'm	a	weird	-	looking	thing	.	``	and	it	was	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	my	 conscious 	 ness 	 	had	 shift 	 ed 	 	away	from	my	normal	 per 	 ception 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	,	where	i	'm	the	person	on	the	machine	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	experience	,	to	some	esoteric	space	where	i	'm	 witness 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	experience	.
and	it	was	all	 ver 	 y 	 	peculiar	,	and	my	 head 	 ache 	 	was	just	 get 	 ting 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.	so	i	get	off	the	machine	,	and	i	'm	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	my	living	room	floor	,	and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	my	body	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	way	down	.	and	every	step	is	 ver 	 y 	 	rigid	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 de 	 liberate 	 	.	there	's	no	 fluid 	 ity 	 	to	my	pace	,	and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 strict 	 ion 	 	in	my	area	of	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	,	so	i	'm	just	focused	on	internal	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	my	 bath 	 room 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	ready	to	step	 in 	 to 	 	the	shower	,	and	i	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	hear	the	 dial 	 ogue 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	my	body	.	i	heard	a	little	voice	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	ok	.	you	 muscle 	 s 	 	,	you	got	ta	contract	.
you	 muscle 	 s 	 	,	you	relax	.	``
and	then	i	lost	my	balance	,	and	i	'm	 pro 	 pped 	 	up	against	the	wall	.
and	i	look	down	at	my	arm	and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	i	can	no	 long 	 er 	 	define	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	my	body	.
i	ca	n't	define	where	i	begin	and	where	i	end	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 atom 	 s 	 	and	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	of	my	arm	 blend 	 ed 	 	with	the	 atom 	 s 	 	and	 molecule 	 s 	 	of	the	wall	.
and	all	i	could	detect	was	 th 	 is 	 	energy	--	energy	.
and	i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	what	is	wrong	with	me	?
what	is	going	on	?	``	and	in	that	moment	,	my	brain	 chat 	 ter 	 	--	my	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	brain	 chat 	 ter 	 	--	went	 total 	 ly 	 	silent	.
just	like	 some 	 one 	 	took	a	remote	control	and	 push 	 ed 	 	the	mute	button	.	total	silence	.
and	at	first	i	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	to	find	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	silent	mind	.	but	then	i	was	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 captiv 	 ated 	 	by	the	 magnific 	 ence 	 	of	the	energy	around	me	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	i	could	no	 long 	 er 	 	identify	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	my	body	,	i	felt	enormous	and	expansive	.
i	felt	at	one	with	all	the	energy	that	was	,	and	it	was	 beaut 	 iful 	 	there	.
then	all	of	a	sudden	my	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	it	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	!	we	got	a	problem	!

and	i	'm	going	,	``	ahh	!	i	got	a	problem	.
i	got	a	problem	.	``	so	it	's	like	,	``	ok	.	ok	.	i	got	a	problem	.	``
but	then	i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 drift 	 ed 	 	right	back	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 conscious 	 ness 	 	--	and	i	 affect 	 ion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	refer	to	 th 	 is 	 	space	 a 	 s 	 	la	la	land	.
but	it	was	 beaut 	 iful 	 	there	.	imagine	what	it	would	be	like	to	be	 total 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	from	your	brain	 chat 	 ter 	 	that	 connect 	 s 	 	you	to	the	external	world	.
so	here	i	am	in	 th 	 is 	 	space	,	and	my	job	--	and	any	stress	related	to	my	job	--	it	was	gone	.
and	i	felt	 light 	 er 	 	in	my	body	.	and	imagine	all	of	the	 relationship 	 s 	 	in	the	external	world	and	any	 stress 	 ors 	 	related	to	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	gone	.
and	i	felt	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 peace 	 fulness 	 	.
and	imagine	what	it	would	feel	like	to	lose	37	 year 	 s 	 	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	 bag 	 g 	 age 	 	!
oh	!	i	felt	euphoria	--	euphoria	.	it	was	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	then	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	my	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	and	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	!	you	've	got	to	pay	attention	.
we	've	got	to	get	help	.	``	and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	got	to	get	help	.
i	got	ta	focus	.	``
so	i	get	out	of	the	shower	and	i	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	dress	and	i	'm	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	,	and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	got	ta	get	to	work	.	i	got	ta	get	to	work	.

and	in	that	moment	my	right	arm	went	 total 	 ly 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	by	my	side	.	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	``	oh	my	 go 	 sh 	 	!	i	'm	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	stroke	!	i	'm	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	stroke	!	``
and	the	next	thing	my	brain	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	is	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	!

``	i	do	n't	have	time	for	a	stroke	!	``
so	i	'm	like	,	``	ok	,	i	ca	n't	stop	the	stroke	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	so	i	'll	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	week	or	two	,	and	then	i	'll	get	back	to	my	routine	.	ok	.
so	i	got	ta	call	help	.	i	got	ta	call	work	.	``
i	could	n't	remember	the	number	at	work	,	so	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	,	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	i	had	a	business	card	with	my	number	on	it	.	so	i	go	 in 	 to 	 	my	business	room	,	i	pull	out	a	three	-	inch	stack	of	business	 card 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	looking	at	the	card	on	top	and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	could	see	 clear 	 ly 	 	in	my	mind	's	eye	what	my	business	card	 look 	 ed 	 	like	,	i	could	n't	tell	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	my	card	or	not	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	i	could	see	 we 	 re 	 	 pixel 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 pixel 	 s 	 	of	the	 word 	 s 	 	 blend 	 ed 	 	with	the	 pixel 	 s 	 	of	the	 back 	 ground 	 	and	the	 pixel 	 s 	 	of	the	 symbol 	 s 	 	,	and	i	just	could	n't	tell	.
and	then	i	would	wait	for	what	i	call	a	wave	of	 clar 	 ity 	 	.
and	in	that	moment	,	i	would	be	able	to	 re 	 attach 	 	to	normal	 re 	 ality 	 	and	i	could	tell	that	's	not	the	card	...	that	's	not	the	card	...	that	's	not	the	card	.
it	took	me	45	 minute 	 s 	 	to	get	one	inch	down	 in 	 side 	 	of	that	stack	of	 card 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	for	45	 minute 	 s 	 	,	the	 hemorrh 	 age 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	in	my	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	.
i	do	not	understand	 number 	 s 	 	,	i	do	not	understand	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	but	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	plan	i	have	.
so	i	take	the	phone	pad	and	i	put	it	right	here	.	i	take	the	business	card	,	i	put	it	right	here	,	and	i	'm	 match 	 ing 	 	the	shape	of	the	 squigg 	 les 	 	on	the	card	to	the	shape	of	the	 squigg 	 les 	 	on	the	phone	pad	.
but	then	i	would	drift	back	out	 in 	 to 	 	la	la	land	,	and	not	remember	when	i	came	back	if	i	'd	 al 	 ready 	 	 dial 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
so	i	had	to	wield	my	 paralyze 	 d 	 	arm	like	a	stump	and	cover	the	 number 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	went	 a 	 long 	 	and	 push 	 ed 	 	them	,	so	that	 a 	 s 	 	i	would	come	back	to	normal	 re 	 ality 	 	,	i	'd	be	able	to	tell	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 dial 	 ed 	 	that	number	.	``
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	the	whole	number	 get 	 s 	 	 dial 	 ed 	 	and	i	'm	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	phone	,	and	my	 col 	 league 	 	 pick 	 s 	 	up	the	phone	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	,	``	 wo 	 o 	 	 wo 	 o 	 	 wo 	 o 	 	 wo 	 o 	 	.	``	and	i	think	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	oh	my	 go 	 sh 	 	,	he	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	 gold 	 en 	 	 retrieve 	 r 	 	!	``
and	so	i	say	to	him	--	clear	in	my	mind	,	i	say	to	him	:	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	jill	!	i	need	help	!	``
and	what	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	my	voice	is	,	``	 wo 	 o 	 	 wo 	 o 	 	 wo 	 o 	 	 wo 	 o 	 	 wo 	 o 	 	.	``
i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	my	 go 	 sh 	 	,	i	sound	like	a	 gold 	 en 	 	 retrieve 	 r 	 	.	``

so	he	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	i	need	help	and	he	 get 	 s 	 	me	help	.
and	a	little	while	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	am	 rid 	 ing 	 	in	an	 ambul 	 ance 	 	from	one	hospital	 a 	 cross 	 	boston	to	[	massachusetts	]	general	hospital	.
and	i	curl	up	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	 fet 	 al 	 	ball	.
and	just	like	a	balloon	with	the	last	bit	of	air	,	just	,	just	right	out	of	the	balloon	,	i	just	felt	my	energy	lift	and	just	--	i	felt	my	spirit	surrender	.
and	in	that	moment	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	 choreograph 	 er 	 	of	my	life	.
and	either	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	 rescu 	 e 	 	my	body	and	give	me	a	second	chance	at	life	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	was	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	my	moment	of	 transit 	 ion 	 	.
when	i	 wok 	 e 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	that	afternoon	,	i	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	to	discover	that	i	was	still	 al 	 ive 	 	.	when	i	felt	my	spirit	surrender	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 good 	 bye 	 	to	my	life	.
and	my	mind	was	now	 suspend 	 ed 	 	between	two	 ver 	 y 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 plane 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	.	 stimul 	 ation 	 	coming	in	through	my	 sensor 	 y 	 	 system 	 s 	 	felt	like	 pur 	 e 	 	pain	.
light	 burn 	 ed 	 	my	brain	like	 wild 	 fire 	 	,	and	 sound 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	loud	and	chaotic	that	i	could	not	pick	a	voice	out	from	the	 back 	 ground 	 	noise	,	and	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 es 	 cape 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	i	could	not	identify	the	position	of	my	body	in	space	,	i	felt	enormous	and	expansive	,	like	a	 gen 	 ie 	 	just	 liberate 	 d 	 	from	her	bottle	.
and	my	spirit	 soar 	 ed 	 	free	,	like	a	great	whale	gliding	through	the	sea	of	silent	euphoria	.
nirvana	.	i	found	nirvana	.	and	i	remember	 think 	 ing 	 	,	there	's	no	way	i	would	ever	be	able	to	 squeez 	 e 	 	the	 enormous 	 ness 	 	of	 my 	 self 	 	back	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	little	body	.
but	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	``	but	i	'm	still	 al 	 ive 	 	!	i	'm	still	 al 	 ive 	 	,	and	i	have	found	nirvana	.	and	if	i	have	found	nirvana	and	i	'm	still	 al 	 ive 	 	,	then	 every 	 one 	 	who	is	 al 	 ive 	 	can	find	nirvana	.	``	and	i	 picture 	 d 	 	a	world	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 peace 	 ful 	 	,	 com 	 passionate 	 	,	loving	people	who	 k 	 new 	 	that	they	could	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	space	at	any	time	.	and	that	they	could	 purpose 	 ly 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	to	step	to	the	right	of	 the 	 ir 	 	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	and	find	 th 	 is 	 	peace	.	and	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	what	a	tremendous	gift	 th 	 is 	 	experience	could	be	,	what	a	stroke	of	 in 	 sight 	 	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	to	how	we	live	our	 live 	 s 	 	.	and	it	 motiv 	 ated 	 	me	to	 re 	 cover 	 	.
two	and	a	half	 week 	 s 	 	after	the	 hemorrh 	 age 	 	,	the	 surgeon 	 s 	 	went	in	and	they	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	a	blood	clot	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	golf	ball	that	was	 push 	 ing 	 	on	my	language	 center 	 s 	 	.
here	i	am	with	my	mama	,	who	is	a	true	angel	in	my	life	.	it	took	me	eight	 year 	 s 	 	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	 re 	 cover 	 	.
so	who	are	we	?	we	are	the	life	-	force	power	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	with	manual	 dexter 	 ity 	 	and	two	cognitive	 mind 	 s 	 	.
and	we	have	the	power	to	 choos 	 e 	 	,	moment	by	moment	,	who	and	how	we	want	to	be	in	the	world	.
right	here	,	right	now	,	i	can	step	 in 	 to 	 	the	 conscious 	 ness 	 	of	my	right	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	where	we	are	.
i	am	the	life	-	force	power	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
i	am	the	life	-	force	power	of	the	50	trillion	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	that	make	up	my	form	,	at	one	with	all	that	is	.
or	,	i	can	 choos 	 e 	 	to	step	 in 	 to 	 	the	 conscious 	 ness 	 	of	my	left	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	where	i	 be 	 come 	 	a	single	individual	,	a	solid	.	 separat 	 e 	 	from	the	flow	,	 separat 	 e 	 	from	you	.	i	am	dr.	jill	bolte	taylor	:	intellectual	,	 neuro 	 anatomist 	 	.	these	are	the	``	we	``	 in 	 side 	 	of	me	.
which	would	you	 choos 	 e 	 	?	which	do	you	 choos 	 e 	 	?	and	when	?
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	more	time	we	 s 	 pend 	 	 choos 	 ing 	 	to	run	the	deep	inner	-	peace	 circuit 	 ry 	 	of	our	right	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	,	the	more	peace	we	will	project	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	,	and	the	more	 peace 	 ful 	 	our	planet	will	be	.
and	i	thought	that	was	an	idea	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
