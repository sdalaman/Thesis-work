my	journey	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	polar	 special 	 ist 	 	,	 photograph 	 ing 	 	,	 special 	 izing 	 	in	the	polar	 region 	 s 	 	,	 beg 	 an 	 	when	i	was	four	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	when	my	family	 move 	 d 	 	from	southern	canada	to	 north 	 ern 	 	baffin	 is 	 land 	 	,	up	by	greenland	.
there	we	lived	with	the	inuit	in	the	 tin 	 y 	 	inuit	community	of	200	inuit	people	,	where	[	we	]	 we 	 re 	 	one	of	three	non	-	inuit	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	community	,	we	did	n't	have	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	;	we	did	n't	have	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	radio	.
we	did	n't	even	have	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	.
all	of	my	time	was	 s 	 pent 	 	 out 	 side 	 	with	the	inuit	,	 play 	 ing 	 	.
the	snow	and	the	ice	 we 	 re 	 	my	 sand 	 box 	 	,	and	the	inuit	 we 	 re 	 	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	where	i	 be 	 came 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	polar	realm	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	 some 	 day 	 	that	i	was	going	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	had	to	do	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	share	news	about	it	and	protect	it	.
i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	,	for	just	two	 minute 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	some	 image 	 s 	 	,	a	cross	-	section	of	my	work	,	to	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	music	by	brandi	carlile	,	``	have	you	ever	.	``
i	do	n't	know	why	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	've	never	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	,	but	they	're	 allow 	 ing 	 	me	to	show	you	a	few	 image 	 s 	 	from	a	 cover 	 age 	 	that	i	've	just	 complete 	 d 	 	that	is	not	 publish 	 ed 	 	yet	.
national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	with	you	.
and	what	these	 image 	 s 	 	are	--	you	'll	see	them	at	the	start	of	the	slide	show	--	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	four	 image 	 s 	 	--	but	it	's	of	a	little	bear	that	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	great	bear	 rain 	 forest 	 	.
it	's	 pur 	 e 	 	white	,	but	it	's	not	a	polar	bear	.
it	's	a	spirit	bear	,	or	a	kermode	bear	.
there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	200	of	these	 bear 	 s 	 	left	.
they	're	more	rare	than	the	 pan 	 da 	 	bear	.
i	 s 	 at 	 	there	on	the	river	for	two	 month 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	one	.
i	thought	,	my	 care 	 er 	 	's	over	.
i	 pro 	 posed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stupid	story	to	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	.
what	in	the	heck	was	i	 think 	 ing 	 	?
so	i	had	two	 month 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	there	and	figure	out	different	ways	of	what	i	was	going	to	do	in	my	next	life	,	after	i	was	a	 photograph 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	fire	me	.
 be 	 cause 	 	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	is	a	magazine	;	they	 re 	 mind 	 	us	all	the	time	:	they	publish	 picture 	 s 	 	,	not	 excuse 	 s 	 	.
and	after	two	 month 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	--	one	day	,	 think 	 ing 	 	that	it	was	all	over	,	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	big	white	male	came	down	,	right	 be 	 side 	 	me	,	three	feet	away	from	me	,	and	he	went	down	and	 grab 	 bed 	 	a	fish	and	went	off	in	the	forest	and	ate	it	.
and	then	i	 s 	 pent 	 	the	entire	day	living	my	 child 	 hood 	 	dream	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	with	 th 	 is 	 	bear	through	the	forest	.
he	went	through	 th 	 is 	 	old	-	growth	forest	and	 s 	 at 	 	up	 be 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	400	-	year	-	old	 cultural 	 ly 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	tree	and	went	to	sleep	.
and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	to	sleep	 with 	 in 	 	three	feet	of	him	,	just	in	the	forest	,	and	photograph	him	.
so	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	show	you	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	and	a	cross	-	section	of	my	work	that	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	on	the	polar	 region 	 s 	 	.

thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	i	appreciate	it	.
we	're	 in 	 un 	 d 	 ated 	 	with	news	all	the	time	that	the	sea	ice	is	 disappear 	 ing 	 	and	it	's	at	 it 	 s 	 	 low 	 est 	 	level	.
and	in	fact	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 original 	 ly 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	sea	ice	is	going	to	disappear	in	the	next	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	then	they	 s 	 aid 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	the	sea	ice	in	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	the	 summer 	 time 	 	 ex 	 tent 	 	is	going	to	be	gone	in	the	next	four	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
after	a	while	of	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	news	,	it	just	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	news	.
you	 glaz 	 e 	 	over	with	it	.
and	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	my	work	is	put	 face 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	want	people	to	understand	and	get	the	 con 	 cept 	 	that	,	if	we	lose	ice	,	we	stand	to	lose	an	entire	 eco 	 system 	 	.
 project 	 ions 	 	are	that	we	could	lose	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	;	they	could	 be 	 come 	 	extinct	in	the	next	50	to	100	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	no	better	,	 s 	 ex 	 ier 	 	,	more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 charisma 	 tic 	 	 mega 	 fauna 	 	species	for	me	to	hang	my	campaign	on	.
polar	 bear 	 s 	 	are	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 hunter 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	bear	i	 s 	 at 	 	with	for	a	while	on	the	 shore 	 s 	 	.
there	was	no	ice	around	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 glaci 	 er 	 	 cav 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	and	a	seal	got	on	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	bear	swam	out	to	that	seal	--	800	lb	.	 beard 	 ed 	 	seal	--	 grab 	 bed 	 	it	,	swam	back	and	ate	it	.
and	he	was	so	full	,	he	was	so	happy	and	so	fat	eating	 th 	 is 	 	seal	,	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 approach 	 ed 	 	him	--	about	20	feet	away	--	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	his	 on 	 ly 	 	defense	was	to	keep	eating	more	seal	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	he	ate	,	he	was	so	full	--	he	 prob 	 ably 	 	had	about	200	 lb 	 s 	 	of	meat	in	his	 bel 	 ly 	 	--	and	 a 	 s 	 	he	ate	 in 	 side 	 	one	side	of	his	mouth	,	he	was	 regurgit 	 ating 	 	out	the	other	side	of	his	mouth	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	these	 bear 	 s 	 	have	any	bit	of	ice	they	will	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	the	ice	that	's	 disappear 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	dead	 bear 	 s 	 	in	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	.
when	i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	biologist	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	never	found	dead	 bear 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	last	four	or	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	dead	 bear 	 s 	 	 pop 	 ping 	 	up	all	over	the	place	.
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	them	in	the	beaufort	sea	,	 float 	 ing 	 	in	the	open	ocean	where	the	ice	 ha 	 s 	 	 melt 	 ed 	 	out	.
i	found	a	couple	in	norway	last	year	.	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	them	on	the	ice	.
these	 bear 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	 sign 	 s 	 	of	the	stress	of	 disappear 	 ing 	 	ice	.
here	's	a	mother	and	her	two	year	-	old	cub	 we 	 re 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	on	a	ship	a	hundred	 mile 	 s 	 	 off 	 shore 	 	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	,	and	they	're	 rid 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	big	piece	of	 glaci 	 er 	 	ice	,	which	is	great	for	them	;	they	're	safe	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
they	're	not	going	to	die	of	 hypo 	 ther 	 mia 	 	.
they	're	going	to	get	to	land	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	95	percent	of	the	 glaci 	 ers 	 	in	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 reced 	 ing 	 	right	now	to	the	point	that	the	ice	is	 end 	 ing 	 	up	on	land	and	not	 inject 	 ing 	 	any	ice	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 eco 	 system 	 	.
these	 ring 	 ed 	 	 seal 	 s 	 	,	these	are	the	``	 fat 	 s 	 icles 	 	``	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	.
these	little	,	fat	 dump 	 ling 	 s 	 	,	150	-	pound	 bundl 	 es 	 	of	 blu 	 b 	 ber 	 	are	the	 main 	 stay 	 	of	the	polar	bear	.
and	they	're	not	like	the	harbor	 seal 	 s 	 	that	you	have	here	.
these	 ring 	 ed 	 	 seal 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	live	out	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	life	cycle	 associate 	 d 	 	and	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	sea	ice	.
they	give	birth	 in 	 side 	 	the	ice	,	and	they	feed	on	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	cod	that	live	under	the	ice	.
and	here	's	a	picture	of	sick	ice	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	piece	of	multi	-	year	ice	that	's	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	what	 scientist 	 s 	 	did	n't	predict	is	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ice	 melt 	 s 	 	,	these	big	 pocket 	 s 	 	of	black	water	are	 form 	 ing 	 	and	they	're	 grab 	 bing 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	energy	and	 accele 	 rating 	 	the	 melt 	 ing 	 	process	.
and	here	we	are	 div 	 ing 	 	in	the	beaufort	sea	.
the	 vis 	 ibility 	 	's	600	ft.	;	we	're	on	our	 safe 	 ty 	 	lines	;	the	ice	is	moving	all	over	the	place	.
i	wish	i	could	 s 	 pend 	 	half	an	hour	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	about	how	we	 al 	 most 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 ive 	 	.
but	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	that	you	have	a	piece	of	multi	-	year	ice	,	that	big	chunk	of	ice	up	in	the	corner	.
in	that	one	single	piece	of	ice	,	you	have	300	species	of	 micro 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	spring	,	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	 return 	 s 	 	to	the	ice	,	it	 form 	 s 	 	the	 phy 	 to 	 plankton 	 	,	 grow 	 s 	 	under	that	ice	,	and	then	you	get	 big 	 ger 	 	 sheet 	 s 	 	of	 sea 	 weed 	 	,	and	then	you	get	the	zoo	plankton	 feed 	 ing 	 	on	all	that	life	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	what	the	ice	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 act 	 s 	 	like	a	garden	.
it	 act 	 s 	 	like	the	 s 	 oil 	 	in	a	garden	.	it	's	an	 in 	 vert 	 ed 	 	garden	.
 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	that	ice	is	like	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	in	a	garden	.
here	's	me	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	.
i	hope	you	appreciate	 your 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	after	an	hour	under	the	ice	.
i	ca	n't	feel	my	lips	;	my	face	is	 froze 	 n 	 	;	i	ca	n't	feel	my	 hand 	 s 	 	;	i	ca	n't	feel	my	feet	.
and	i	've	come	up	,	and	all	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	get	out	of	the	water	.
after	an	hour	in	these	 condition 	 s 	 	,	it	's	so	 extrem 	 e 	 	that	,	when	i	go	down	,	 al 	 most 	 	every	 d 	 ive 	 	i	vomit	 in 	 to 	 	my	 regulat 	 or 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	my	body	ca	n't	deal	with	the	stress	of	the	cold	on	my	head	.
and	so	i	'm	just	so	happy	that	the	 d 	 ive 	 	is	over	.
i	get	to	hand	my	camera	to	my	 assist 	 ant 	 	,	and	i	'm	looking	up	at	him	,	and	i	'm	going	,	``	 wo 	 o 	 	.	 wo 	 o 	 	.	 wo 	 o 	 	.	``
which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	``	take	my	camera	.	``
and	he	 think 	 s 	 	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	take	my	picture	.	``
so	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	little	communication	 break 	 down 	 	.
but	it	's	worth	it	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 bel 	 uga 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	,	 bow 	 head 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	,	and	 nar 	 whal 	 s 	 	,	and	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	,	and	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	picture	right	here	 mean 	 s 	 	more	to	me	than	any	other	i	've	ever	made	.
i	 drop 	 ped 	 	down	in	 th 	 is 	 	ice	hole	,	just	through	that	hole	that	you	just	saw	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	under	the	 under 	 side 	 	of	the	ice	,	and	i	was	dizzy	;	i	thought	i	had	 vert 	 i 	 go 	 	.
i	got	 ver 	 y 	 	nervous	--	no	rope	,	no	 safe 	 ty 	 	line	,	the	whole	world	is	moving	around	me	--	and	i	thought	,	``	i	'm	in	trouble	.	``
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	that	the	entire	 under 	 side 	 	was	full	of	these	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 amphi 	 pods 	 	and	 cope 	 pods 	 	moving	around	and	 feed 	 ing 	 	on	the	 under 	 side 	 	of	the	ice	,	giving	birth	and	living	out	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	life	cycle	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	the	whole	food	chain	in	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	right	here	.
and	when	you	have	low	 product 	 ivity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	ice	,	the	 product 	 ivity 	 	in	 cope 	 pods 	 	go	down	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 bow 	 head 	 	whale	.
 suppose 	 d 	 ly 	 	,	science	is	 stat 	 ing 	 	that	it	could	be	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	animal	on	earth	right	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	whale	right	here	could	be	over	250	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
 th 	 is 	 	whale	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	born	around	the	start	of	the	industrial	revolution	.
it	could	have	 surviv 	 ed 	 	150	 year 	 s 	 	of	 whal 	 ing 	 	.
and	now	 it 	 s 	 	 big 	 gest 	 	threat	is	the	 disappear 	 ance 	 	of	ice	in	the	north	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 live 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 lead 	 ing 	 	in	the	south	.
 nar 	 whal 	 s 	 	,	these	 majes 	 tic 	 	 nar 	 whal 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	eight	-	foot	long	 iv 	 ory 	 	 tusk 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	have	to	be	here	;	they	could	be	out	on	the	open	water	.
but	they	're	forcing	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	come	up	in	these	 tin 	 y 	 	little	ice	 hole 	 s 	 	where	they	can	breathe	,	catch	a	breath	,	 be 	 cause 	 	right	under	that	ice	are	all	the	 s 	 warm 	 s 	 	of	cod	.
and	the	cod	are	there	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 feed 	 ing 	 	on	all	the	 cope 	 pods 	 	and	 amphi 	 pods 	 	.
 al 	 right 	 	,	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	part	.
when	i	'm	on	my	 death 	 bed 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	remember	one	story	more	than	any	other	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	that	spirit	bear	moment	was	 power 	 ful 	 	,	i	do	n't	think	i	'll	ever	have	 an 	 other 	 	experience	like	i	did	with	these	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	.
leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	,	since	the	time	of	shackleton	,	have	had	a	bad	reputation	.
they	've	got	that	 wry 	 ly 	 	 s 	 mile 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	mouth	.
they	've	got	 t 	 hose 	 	black	 s 	 ini 	 ster 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 spot 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	body	.
they	look	 positive 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 historic 	 	and	a	bit	 scar 	 y 	 	.
and	 tragic 	 ally 	 	in	[	2003	]	,	a	scientist	was	taken	down	and	 drown 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	a	leopard	seal	.
and	people	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	we	 k 	 new 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 vic 	 ious 	 	.	we	 k 	 new 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	.	``
and	so	people	love	to	form	 the 	 ir 	 	 opinion 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	when	i	got	a	story	idea	:	i	want	to	go	to	antarctica	,	get	in	the	water	with	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	possibly	can	and	give	them	a	fair	shake	--	find	out	if	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	these	 vic 	 ious 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	or	if	they	're	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	story	.
oh	,	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	happen	to	eat	happy	feet	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	species	,	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	like	to	say	 penguin 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	cute	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	eat	them	,	so	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	are	 ug 	 ly 	 	and	bad	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	that	way	.
the	penguin	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	it	's	cute	,	and	the	leopard	seal	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	it	's	kind	of	big	and	 monstr 	 ous 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	food	chain	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	.
they	're	 al 	 so 	 	big	.
they	're	not	these	little	harbor	 seal 	 s 	 	.
they	are	12	ft.	long	,	a	thousand	 pound 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 cur 	 iously 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	.
you	get	12	 tourist 	 s 	 	 pack 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	zodiac	,	 float 	 ing 	 	in	these	 ic 	 y 	 	 water 	 s 	 	,	and	a	leopard	seal	 come 	 s 	 	up	and	 bite 	 s 	 	the	pontoon	.
the	boat	 start 	 s 	 	to	sink	,	they	race	back	to	the	ship	and	get	to	go	home	and	tell	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	how	they	got	 attack 	 ed 	 	.
all	the	leopard	seal	was	 do 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	just	 bit 	 ing 	 	a	balloon	.
it	just	 s 	 ees 	 	 th 	 is 	 	big	balloon	in	the	ocean	--	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 hand 	 s 	 	--	it	's	going	to	take	a	little	bite	,	the	boat	 pop 	 s 	 	,	and	off	they	go	.
so	after	five	 day 	 s 	 	of	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	drake	 pass 	 age 	 	--	is	n't	that	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
after	five	 day 	 s 	 	of	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	drake	 pass 	 age 	 	,	we	have	 final 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	antarctica	.
i	'm	with	my	swedish	 assist 	 ant 	 	and	guide	.
his	name	is	goran	ehlme	from	sweden	--	goran	.
and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	experience	with	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	.	i	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	one	.
so	we	come	around	the	cove	in	our	little	zodiac	boat	,	and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 monstr 	 ous 	 	leopard	seal	.
and	even	in	his	voice	,	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	that	's	a	 blood 	 y 	 	big	seal	,	ya	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	seal	is	taking	 th 	 is 	 	penguin	by	the	head	,	and	it	's	 flip 	 ping 	 	it	back	and	forth	.
and	what	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	turn	that	penguin	 in 	 side 	 	-	out	,	so	it	can	eat	the	meat	off	the	 bone 	 s 	 	,	and	then	it	 go 	 es 	 	off	and	 get 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	leopard	seal	 grab 	 bed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	penguin	,	came	under	the	boat	,	the	zodiac	,	 start 	 ing 	 	hitting	the	hull	of	the	boat	.
and	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	not	fall	in	the	water	.
and	we	 s 	 it 	 	down	,	and	that	's	when	goran	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	seal	,	ya	.
it	's	time	for	you	to	get	in	the	water	.	``
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	goran	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	``	forget	that	.	``
but	i	think	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	used	a	different	word	 start 	 ing 	 	with	the	letter	f	.
but	he	was	right	.
he	 s 	 cold 	 ed 	 	me	out	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	we	're	here	.
and	you	 purpose 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stupid	story	to	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	.
and	now	you	've	got	to	deliver	.
and	you	ca	n't	publish	 excuse 	 s 	 	.	``
so	i	had	 s 	 uch 	 	dry	mouth	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	bad	 a 	 s 	 	now	--	but	i	had	 s 	 uch 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	dry	mouth	.
and	my	 leg 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	 trem 	 bling 	 	.	i	could	n't	feel	my	 leg 	 s 	 	.
i	put	my	 flip 	 per 	 s 	 	on	.	i	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	part	my	lips	.
i	put	my	snorkel	in	my	mouth	,	and	i	 roll 	 ed 	 	over	the	side	of	the	zodiac	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	thing	she	did	.
she	came	 rac 	 ing 	 	up	to	me	,	 engulf 	 ed 	 	my	whole	camera	--	and	her	 tee 	 th 	 	are	up	here	and	down	here	--	but	goran	,	before	i	had	gotten	in	the	water	,	had	 give 	 n 	 	me	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	get	 scar 	 ed 	 	,	you	close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	ya	,	and	she	'll	go	away	.	``
so	that	's	all	i	had	to	work	with	at	that	point	.
but	i	just	 start 	 ed 	 	to	shoot	these	 picture 	 s 	 	.
so	she	did	 th 	 is 	 	threat	 dis 	 play 	 	for	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	she	 total 	 ly 	 	 relax 	 ed 	 	.
she	went	off	,	she	got	a	penguin	.
she	 stop 	 ped 	 	about	10	feet	away	from	me	,	and	she	 s 	 at 	 	there	with	 th 	 is 	 	penguin	,	the	penguin	's	flapping	,	and	she	let	's	it	go	.
the	penguin	 swim 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	me	,	 take 	 s 	 	off	.
she	 grab 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	.	she	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	over	and	over	.
and	it	 dawn 	 ed 	 	on	me	that	she	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	feed	me	a	penguin	.
why	else	would	she	 re 	 lease 	 	these	 penguin 	 s 	 	at	me	?
and	after	she	did	 th 	 is 	 	four	or	five	 time 	 s 	 	,	she	swam	by	me	with	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 eject 	 ed 	 	look	on	her	face	.
you	do	n't	want	to	be	too	 anthropo 	 morphic 	 	,	but	i	 s 	 wear 	 	that	she	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	like	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	 use 	 less 	 	predator	's	going	to	 starv 	 e 	 	in	my	ocean	.	``
so	 real 	 izing 	 	i	could	n't	catch	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	,	she	'd	get	these	other	 penguin 	 s 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	them	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	me	,	 bobb 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	she	'd	let	them	go	.
 th 	 is 	 	did	n't	work	.
i	was	 laugh 	 ing 	 	so	hard	and	so	 emotion 	 al 	 	that	my	mask	was	 flood 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 cry 	 ing 	 	 under 	 water 	 	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	that	did	n't	work	.
so	then	she	'd	get	 an 	 other 	 	penguin	and	try	 th 	 is 	 	ballet	-	like	sexy	 dis 	 play 	 	 slid 	 ing 	 	down	 th 	 is 	 	 ice 	 berg 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	she	would	sort	of	 br 	 ing 	 	them	over	to	me	and	 off 	 er 	 	it	to	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	went	on	for	four	 day 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	just	did	n't	happen	a	couple	of	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	then	so	she	 real 	 ized 	 	i	could	n't	catch	live	 one 	 s 	 	,	so	she	 br 	 ought 	 	me	dead	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
now	i	've	got	four	or	five	 penguin 	 s 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	around	my	head	,	and	i	'm	just	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 shoot 	 ing 	 	away	.
and	she	would	often	stop	and	have	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 eject 	 ed 	 	look	on	her	face	like	,	``	are	you	for	real	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	she	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	i	ca	n't	eat	 th 	 is 	 	penguin	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	her	world	,	you	're	either	 breed 	 ing 	 	or	you	're	eating	--	and	i	'm	not	 breed 	 ing 	 	,	so	...
and	then	that	was	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	;	she	 start 	 ed 	 	to	flip	 penguin 	 s 	 	onto	my	head	.
she	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	force	-	feed	me	.	she	's	 push 	 ing 	 	me	around	.
she	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	force	-	feed	my	camera	,	which	is	every	 photograph 	 er 	 	's	dream	.
and	she	would	get	 frust 	 rated 	 	;	she	'd	blow	 bubble 	 s 	 	in	my	face	.
she	would	,	i	think	,	let	me	know	that	i	was	going	to	 starv 	 e 	 	.
but	yet	she	did	n't	stop	.
she	would	not	stop	 try 	 ing 	 	to	feed	me	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
and	on	the	last	day	with	 th 	 is 	 	female	where	i	thought	i	had	 push 	 ed 	 	her	too	far	,	i	got	nervous	 be 	 cause 	 	she	came	up	to	me	,	she	 roll 	 ed 	 	over	on	her	back	,	and	she	did	 th 	 is 	 	deep	,	 gutt 	 ural 	 	 jack 	 hammer 	 	sound	,	 th 	 is 	 	 gokgok 	 gokgok 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	she	's	about	to	bite	.
she	's	about	to	let	me	know	she	's	too	 frust 	 rated 	 	with	me	.
what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	 an 	 other 	 	seal	had	snuck	in	 be 	 hind 	 	me	,	and	she	did	that	to	threat	 dis 	 play 	 	.
she	 chase 	 d 	 	that	big	seal	away	,	went	and	got	 it 	 s 	 	penguin	and	 br 	 ought 	 	it	to	me	.
that	was	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	seal	i	got	in	the	water	with	.
i	got	in	the	water	with	30	other	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	,	and	i	never	once	had	a	 scar 	 y 	 	 en 	 counter 	 	.
they	are	the	most	 remark 	 able 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	i	've	ever	 work 	 ed 	 	with	,	and	the	same	with	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	.
and	just	like	the	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	,	these	 animal 	 s 	 	depend	on	an	 ic 	 y 	 	environment	.
i	get	 emotion 	 al 	 	.	sorry	.
it	's	a	story	that	 live 	 s 	 	deep	in	my	heart	,	and	i	'm	proud	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	with	you	.
and	i	'm	so	passionate	about	it	.
 any 	 body 	 	want	to	come	with	me	to	antarctica	or	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	i	'll	take	you	;	let	's	go	.
we	've	got	to	get	the	story	out	now	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.	 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
