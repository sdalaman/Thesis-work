i	'm	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	about	how	we	can	tap	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 util 	 ized 	 	resource	in	health	care	,	which	is	the	patient	,	or	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	like	to	use	the	scientific	term	,	people	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	all	 patient 	 s 	 	,	we	are	all	people	.
even	 doctor 	 s 	 	are	 patient 	 s 	 	at	some	point	.
so	i	want	to	talk	about	that	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	engage	with	 ver 	 y 	 	well	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	and	,	in	fact	,	 world 	 wide 	 	.
if	you	want	to	get	at	the	big	part	--	i	mean	from	a	public	health	level	,	where	my	training	is	--	you	're	looking	at	 behavior 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
you	're	looking	at	 thing 	 s 	 	where	people	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 give 	 n 	 	information	,	and	they	're	not	 follow 	 ing 	 	through	with	it	.
it	's	a	problem	that	 manifest 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	diabetes	,	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	heart	disease	,	even	some	 form 	 s 	 	of	cancer	--	when	you	think	of	 smok 	 ing 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	 behavior 	 s 	 	where	people	know	what	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	.
they	know	what	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	,	but	they	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
now	behavior	change	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	a	long	-	 stand 	 ing 	 	problem	in	medicine	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	all	the	way	back	to	aristotle	.
and	 doctor 	 s 	 	hate	it	,	right	?
i	mean	,	they	complain	about	it	all	the	time	.
we	talk	about	it	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	or	non	-	compliance	.
when	people	do	n't	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 pill 	 s 	 	,	when	people	do	n't	follow	 doctor 	 s 	 	'	 order 	 s 	 	--	these	are	behavior	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	for	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	 clinic 	 al 	 	medicine	 agon 	 ize 	 s 	 	over	behavior	change	,	there	's	not	a	lot	of	work	 d 	 one 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	fix	that	problem	.
so	the	crux	of	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	decision	-	making	--	giving	information	to	people	in	a	form	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	 educ 	 ate 	 	them	or	inform	them	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	them	to	make	better	 decision 	 s 	 	,	better	 choice 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
one	part	of	medicine	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 face 	 d 	 	the	problem	of	behavior	change	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	,	and	that	's	 dent 	 ist 	 ry 	 	.
 dent 	 ist 	 ry 	 	might	seem	--	and	i	think	it	is	--	 man 	 y 	 	 dent 	 ists 	 	would	have	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	it	's	 some 	 what 	 	of	a	mundane	 back 	 water 	 	of	medicine	.
not	a	lot	of	cool	,	sexy	stuff	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 dent 	 ist 	 ry 	 	.
but	they	have	 re 	 ally 	 	taken	 th 	 is 	 	problem	of	behavior	change	and	 solve 	 d 	 	it	.
it	's	the	one	great	 prevent 	 ive 	 	health	success	we	have	in	our	health	care	system	.
people	brush	and	floss	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	.
they	do	n't	do	it	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	they	should	,	but	they	do	it	.
so	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	one	experiment	that	a	few	 dent 	 ists 	 	in	connecticut	 cook 	 ed 	 	up	about	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	old	experiment	,	but	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	so	it	's	an	easy	story	to	tell	.
so	these	connecticut	 dent 	 ists 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	that	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	people	to	brush	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	and	floss	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	more	often	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	use	one	 vari 	 able 	 	:	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 care 	 	them	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	them	how	bad	it	would	be	if	they	did	n't	brush	and	floss	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	.
they	had	a	big	patient	population	.
they	 divid 	 ed 	 	them	up	 in 	 to 	 	two	 group 	 s 	 	.
they	had	a	low	-	fear	population	,	where	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	13	-	minute	 present 	 ation 	 	,	all	based	in	science	,	but	told	them	that	,	if	you	did	n't	brush	and	floss	your	 tee 	 th 	 	,	you	could	get	gum	disease	.	if	you	get	gum	disease	,	you	will	lose	your	 tee 	 th 	 	,	but	you	'll	get	 dent 	 ures 	 	,	and	it	wo	n't	be	that	bad	.
so	that	was	the	low	-	fear	group	.
the	high	-	fear	group	,	they	laid	it	on	 re 	 ally 	 	thick	.
they	 show 	 ed 	 	 blood 	 y 	 	 gum 	 s 	 	.
they	 show 	 ed 	 	 pu 	 s 	 s 	 	 ooz 	 ing 	 	out	from	between	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	.
they	told	them	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	fall	out	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	that	they	could	have	 infect 	 ions 	 	that	would	spread	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 jaw 	 s 	 	to	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	,	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	would	lose	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	.
they	would	get	 dent 	 ures 	 	,	and	if	you	got	 dent 	 ures 	 	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	be	able	to	eat	corn	-	on	-	the	-	cob	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	be	able	to	eat	 apple 	 s 	 	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	be	able	to	eat	steak	.
you	'll	eat	mush	for	the	rest	of	your	life	.
so	go	brush	and	floss	your	 tee 	 th 	 	.
that	was	the	 mess 	 age 	 	.	that	was	the	experiment	.
now	they	 measur 	 ed 	 	one	other	 vari 	 able 	 	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	capture	one	other	 vari 	 able 	 	,	which	was	the	 patient 	 s 	 	'	sense	of	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 whet 	 her 	 	the	 patient 	 s 	 	felt	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	would	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	brush	and	floss	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	.
so	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	``	do	you	think	you	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	stick	with	 th 	 is 	 	program	?	``
and	the	people	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	about	that	,	``	they	 we 	 re 	 	 character 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	high	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	,	and	the	people	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	eh	,	i	never	get	around	to	 brush 	 ing 	 	and	 floss 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	i	should	,	``	they	 we 	 re 	 	 character 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	low	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	.
so	the	 up 	 shot 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	 up 	 shot 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	was	that	fear	was	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 prim 	 ary 	 	driver	of	the	behavior	at	all	.
the	people	who	 brush 	 ed 	 	and	 floss 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	about	what	would	happen	--	it	's	the	people	who	 simpl 	 y 	 	felt	that	they	had	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
so	fear	 show 	 ed 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	the	driver	.
it	was	the	sense	of	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	.
so	i	want	to	isolate	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	great	 observ 	 ation 	 	--	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	right	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	and	it	's	one	that	's	laid	 f 	 allow 	 	in	research	.
it	was	a	 not 	 ion 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	came	out	of	albert	bandura	's	work	,	who	 stud 	 ied 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	people	could	get	a	sense	of	 empower 	 ment 	 	.
the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 boil 	 s 	 	down	to	one	--	that	if	 some 	 body 	 	 believ 	 es 	 	that	they	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
in	health	care	 term 	 s 	 	,	you	could	 character 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	 some 	 body 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	that	they	see	a	path	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	better	health	,	that	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	 the 	 ir 	 	way	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	better	health	,	and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	.
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	how	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	it	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	that	well	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	do	.
so	fear	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	right	?	fear	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	we	have	n't	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	 less 	 on 	 	at	all	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	campaign	from	the	american	diabetes	 associ 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	still	the	way	we	're	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	about	health	.
i	mean	,	i	 show 	 ed 	 	my	three	-	year	-	old	 th 	 is 	 	slide	last	night	,	and	he	's	like	,	``	papa	,	why	is	an	 ambul 	 ance 	 	in	these	people	's	 home 	 s 	 	?	``
and	i	had	to	explain	,	``	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 care 	 	people	.	``
and	i	do	n't	know	if	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
now	here	's	what	 do 	 es 	 	work	:	 personal 	 ized 	 	information	 work 	 s 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	bandura	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 decade 	 s 	 	ago	.
when	you	give	people	specific	information	about	 the 	 ir 	 	health	,	where	they	stand	,	and	where	they	want	to	get	to	,	where	they	might	get	to	,	that	path	,	that	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	path	--	that	 tend 	 s 	 	to	work	for	behavior	change	.
so	let	me	just	 s 	 pool 	 	it	out	a	little	bit	.
so	you	start	with	 personal 	 ized 	 	data	,	 personal 	 ized 	 	information	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	an	individual	,	and	then	you	need	to	connect	it	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
you	need	to	connect	it	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	not	in	a	fear	-	based	way	,	but	one	that	they	understand	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	know	where	i	 s 	 it 	 	.	i	know	where	i	'm	 situ 	 ated 	 	.
and	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	work	for	me	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	abstract	 number 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 over 	 load 	 	of	health	information	that	we	're	 in 	 un 	 d 	 ated 	 	with	.
but	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	home	.
it	's	not	just	hitting	us	in	our	 head 	 s 	 	;	it	's	hitting	us	in	our	 heart 	 s 	 	.
there	's	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	information	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	from	us	.
that	information	then	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 choice 	 s 	 	,	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	a	range	of	 option 	 s 	 	,	 direction 	 s 	 	that	we	might	go	to	--	trade	-	offs	,	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	to	be	 present 	 ed 	 	with	a	clear	point	of	action	.
we	need	to	connect	the	information	 al 	 ways 	 	with	the	action	,	and	then	that	action	 feed 	 s 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	different	information	,	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	a	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	 observ 	 ed 	 	and	well	-	 establish 	 ed 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	for	behavior	change	.
but	the	problem	is	that	 thing 	 s 	 	--	in	the	upper	-	right	corner	there	--	 personal 	 ized 	 	data	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	to	come	by	.
it	's	a	difficult	and	expensive	 commodit 	 y 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	now	.
so	i	'm	going	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	we	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	these	.	these	are	the	``	your	speed	limit	``	 sign 	 s 	 	.
you	've	 s 	 een 	 	them	all	around	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 radar 	 s 	 	are	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
and	here	's	how	they	work	in	the	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	.
so	you	start	with	the	 personal 	 ized 	 	data	where	the	speed	limit	on	the	road	that	you	are	at	that	point	is	25	,	and	,	of	course	,	you	're	going	 fast 	 er 	 	than	that	.
we	 al 	 ways 	 	are	.	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	going	above	the	speed	limit	.
the	choice	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	.
we	either	keep	going	fast	,	or	we	 s 	 low 	 	down	.
we	should	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	and	that	point	of	action	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	now	.
we	should	take	our	foot	off	the	 ped 	 al 	 	right	now	,	and	 general 	 ly 	 	we	do	.	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 show 	 n 	 	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	effective	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	people	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	.
they	 reduc 	 e 	 	 speed 	 s 	 	by	about	five	to	10	percent	.
they	last	for	about	five	 mile 	 s 	 	,	in	which	case	we	put	our	foot	back	on	the	 ped 	 al 	 	.
but	it	 work 	 s 	 	,	and	it	even	 ha 	 s 	 	some	health	 re 	 percuss 	 ions 	 	.
your	blood	pressure	might	drop	a	little	bit	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	's	 few 	 er 	 	 accident 	 s 	 	,	so	there	's	public	health	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
but	by	and	large	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	that	's	so	nifty	and	too	rare	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	health	care	,	most	health	care	,	the	data	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	action	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	line	 thing 	 s 	 	up	so	 neat 	 ly 	 	.
but	we	have	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
so	i	want	to	talk	about	,	i	want	to	shift	now	to	think	about	how	we	deliver	health	information	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	how	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	information	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	pharmaceutical	ad	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	 s 	 po 	 of 	 	.	it	's	not	a	real	pharmaceutical	ad	.
 no 	 body 	 	's	had	the	 brilli 	 ant 	 	idea	of	 call 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	drug	havidol	 quit 	 e 	 	yet	.
but	it	 look 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	right	.
so	it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	way	we	get	health	information	and	pharmaceutical	information	,	and	it	just	 sound 	 s 	 	perfect	.
and	then	we	turn	the	page	of	the	magazine	,	and	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	--	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	page	the	fda	 requir 	 es 	 	pharmaceutical	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	put	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	,	or	to	follow	 the 	 ir 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	,	and	to	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 cynic 	 al 	 	 exercis 	 es 	 	in	medicine	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	.
who	among	us	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	say	that	people	read	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	who	among	us	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	say	that	people	who	do	try	to	read	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 any 	 thing 	 	out	of	it	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bankrupt	effort	at	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	health	information	.
there	is	no	good	faith	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	different	approach	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	approach	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	a	couple	 research 	 ers 	 	at	dartmouth	medical	school	,	lisa	schwartz	and	steven	woloshin	.
and	they	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	drug	 fact 	 s 	 	box	.	``
they	took	inspiration	from	,	of	all	 thing 	 s 	 	,	cap'n	crunch	.
they	went	to	the	 nutrition 	 al 	 	information	box	and	saw	that	what	 work 	 s 	 	for	 ce 	 real 	 	,	 work 	 s 	 	for	our	food	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 help 	 s 	 	people	understand	what	's	in	 the 	 ir 	 	food	.
god	forbid	we	should	use	that	same	standard	that	we	make	cap'n	crunch	live	by	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	drug	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
so	let	me	just	walk	through	 th 	 is 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	what	the	drug	is	for	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	who	it	is	good	for	,	so	you	can	start	to	 personal 	 ize 	 	your	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 whet 	 her 	 	the	information	is	relevant	to	you	or	 whet 	 her 	 	the	drug	is	relevant	to	you	.
you	can	understand	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	are	.
it	is	n't	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	vague	promise	that	it	's	going	to	work	no	matter	what	,	but	you	get	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	for	how	effective	it	is	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	you	understand	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	are	.
you	can	start	to	 un 	 pack 	 	the	 choice 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	.
every	time	you	take	a	drug	,	you	're	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	possible	side	effect	.
so	it	 spell 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	out	in	 ver 	 y 	 	clean	 term 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	i	love	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	love	that	drug	 fact 	 s 	 	box	.
and	so	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	what	's	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	that	i	could	have	to	help	people	understand	information	?
what	's	 an 	 other 	 	 lat 	 ent 	 	body	of	information	that	's	out	there	that	people	are	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 put 	 ting 	 	to	use	?
and	so	i	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	:	lab	test	 result 	 s 	 	.
blood	test	 result 	 s 	 	are	 th 	 is 	 	great	source	of	information	.
they	're	 pack 	 ed 	 	with	information	.
they	're	just	not	for	us	.	they	're	not	for	people	.	they	're	not	for	 patient 	 s 	 	.
they	go	right	to	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
and	god	forbid	--	i	think	 man 	 y 	 	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	either	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	worst	 present 	 ed 	 	information	.
you	ask	tufte	,	and	he	would	say	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	absolute	worst	 present 	 ation 	 	of	information	possible	.	``
what	we	did	at	wired	was	we	went	,	and	i	got	our	graphic	design	 depart 	 ment 	 	to	re	-	imagine	these	lab	 report 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	what	i	want	to	walk	you	through	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	general	blood	work	before	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	after	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	came	up	with	.
the	after	 take 	 s 	 	what	was	four	 page 	 s 	 	--	that	previous	slide	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	first	of	four	 page 	 s 	 	of	data	that	's	just	the	general	blood	work	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	on	and	on	and	on	,	all	these	 value 	 s 	 	,	all	these	 number 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	know	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	one	-	page	 summ 	 ary 	 	.
we	use	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	color	.
it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	that	color	could	be	used	.
so	on	the	top	-	level	you	have	your	 over 	 all 	 	 result 	 s 	 	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	might	jump	out	at	you	from	the	fine	print	.
then	you	can	drill	down	and	understand	how	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	put	your	level	in	 con 	 text 	 	,	and	we	use	color	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	your	value	 fall 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 th 	 is 	 	patient	is	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	at	risk	of	diabetes	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	glucose	level	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	you	can	go	over	your	 lipid 	 s 	 	and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	understand	what	your	 over 	 all 	 	cholesterol	level	is	and	then	break	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	hdl	and	the	ldl	if	you	so	 choos 	 e 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	using	color	and	 personal 	 ized 	 	 proxim 	 ity 	 	to	that	information	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 value 	 s 	 	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 page 	 s 	 	and	 page 	 s 	 	of	 value 	 s 	 	that	are	full	of	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	we	summarize	.
we	tell	you	that	you	're	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	you	're	normal	.
but	you	do	n't	have	to	 wa 	 de 	 	through	it	.	you	do	n't	have	to	go	through	the	junk	.
and	then	we	do	two	other	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	kind	of	help	fill	in	 th 	 is 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	:	we	help	people	understand	in	a	little	more	detail	what	these	 value 	 s 	 	are	and	what	they	might	 indic 	 ate 	 	.
and	then	we	go	a	further	step	--	we	tell	them	what	they	can	do	.
we	give	them	some	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	what	 choice 	 s 	 	they	can	make	,	what	 action 	 s 	 	they	can	take	.
so	that	's	our	general	blood	work	test	.
then	we	went	to	crp	test	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	it	's	a	 s 	 in 	 	of	 o 	 mission 	 	.
they	have	 th 	 is 	 	huge	amount	of	space	,	and	they	do	n't	use	it	for	 any 	 thing 	 	,	so	we	do	.
now	the	crp	test	is	often	 d 	 one 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	a	cholesterol	test	,	or	in	 con 	 junction 	 	with	a	cholesterol	test	.
so	we	take	the	bold	step	of	 put 	 ting 	 	the	cholesterol	information	on	the	same	page	,	which	is	the	way	the	doctor	is	going	to	evaluate	it	.
so	we	thought	the	patient	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	to	know	the	 con 	 text 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
it	's	a	protein	that	 show 	 s 	 	up	when	your	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	might	be	 infla 	 med 	 	,	which	might	be	a	risk	for	heart	disease	.
what	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 measur 	 ing 	 	is	 spell 	 ed 	 	out	in	clean	language	.
then	we	use	the	information	that	's	 al 	 ready 	 	in	the	lab	report	.
we	use	the	person	's	age	and	 the 	 ir 	 	gender	to	start	to	fill	in	the	 personal 	 ized 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	.
so	we	start	to	use	the	data	we	have	to	run	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 calcul 	 ation 	 	that	's	on	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 on 	 line 	 	 calcul 	 ators 	 	to	get	a	sense	of	what	the	actual	risk	is	.
the	last	one	i	'll	show	you	is	a	psa	test	.
here	's	the	before	,	and	here	's	the	after	.
now	a	lot	of	our	effort	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	--	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	,	a	psa	test	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	controversial	test	.
it	's	used	to	test	for	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	,	but	there	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	why	your	 pro 	 state 	 	might	be	 enlarg 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	we	 s 	 pent 	 	a	good	deal	of	our	time	 indic 	 ating 	 	that	.
we	 aga 	 in 	 	 personal 	 ized 	 	the	 risk 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	patient	is	in	 the 	 ir 	 	50s	,	so	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	give	them	a	 ver 	 y 	 	precise	estimate	of	what	 the 	 ir 	 	risk	for	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	is	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	's	about	25	percent	,	based	on	that	.
and	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	follow	-	up	 action 	 s 	 	.
so	our	cost	for	 th 	 is 	 	was	less	than	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	all	right	.
that	's	what	wired	magazine	 s 	 pent 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
why	is	wired	magazine	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
quest	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	and	labcorp	,	the	two	largest	lab	 test 	 ing 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	--	last	year	,	they	made	 profit 	 s 	 	of	over	700	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	over	500	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 respect 	 ively 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	problem	of	 resource 	 s 	 	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	of	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	the	target	of	 th 	 is 	 	information	should	not	be	the	doctor	,	should	not	be	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	company	.
it	should	be	the	patient	.
it	's	the	person	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	end	,	is	going	to	be	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	then	start	 adopt 	 ing 	 	new	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	information	that	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
it	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	catalyst	to	change	.
but	we	're	not	using	it	.	it	's	just	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	lost	.
so	i	want	to	just	 off 	 er 	 	four	 question 	 s 	 	that	every	patient	should	ask	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	expect	people	to	start	 develop 	 ing 	 	these	lab	test	 report 	 s 	 	.
but	you	can	create	your	own	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	.
 any 	 body 	 	can	create	 the 	 ir 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	by	 ask 	 ing 	 	these	simple	 question 	 s 	 	:	can	i	have	my	 result 	 s 	 	?
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 able 	 	answer	is	--	--	 y 	 es 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?	help	me	understand	what	the	data	is	.
what	are	my	 option 	 s 	 	?	what	 choice 	 s 	 	are	now	on	the	table	?
and	then	,	what	's	next	?
how	do	i	integrate	 th 	 is 	 	information	 in 	 to 	 	the	 long 	 er 	 	course	of	my	life	?
so	i	want	to	wind	up	by	just	 show 	 ing 	 	that	people	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	information	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	beyond	the	grasp	of	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	.
you	do	not	need	to	have	the	education	level	of	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	if	we	 on 	 ly 	 	go	to	the	effort	of	 present 	 ing 	 	it	to	them	in	a	form	that	they	can	engage	with	.
and	 engage 	 ment 	 	is	essential	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	just	giving	them	information	;	it	's	giving	them	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	act	.
that	's	what	 engage 	 ment 	 	is	.	it	's	different	from	compliance	.
it	 work 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	different	from	the	way	we	talk	about	behavior	in	medicine	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	information	is	out	there	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	about	 lat 	 ent 	 	information	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	information	that	 exist 	 s 	 	in	the	system	that	we	're	not	 put 	 ting 	 	to	use	.
but	there	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	other	bodies	of	information	that	are	coming	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	we	need	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	information	to	engage	people	,	to	help	people	and	to	change	the	course	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
