i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	relationship	of	 form 	 al 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	and	human	behavior	.
if	you	build	a	wide	road	out	to	the	 out 	 skirt 	 s 	 	of	town	,	people	will	move	there	.
well	,	law	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	driver	of	human	behavior	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	discuss	 to 	 day 	 	is	the	need	to	 over 	 haul 	 	and	 simpl 	 ify 	 	the	law	to	 re 	 lease 	 	the	energy	and	 pass 	 ion 	 	of	americans	,	so	that	we	can	begin	to	address	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
you	might	have	 notice 	 d 	 	that	law	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	 progress 	 ively 	 	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	in	your	 live 	 s 	 	over	the	last	decade	or	two	.
if	you	run	a	business	,	it	's	hard	to	do	much	of	 any 	 thing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	your	general	counsel	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	now	where	the	general	 counsel 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	the	ceos	.
it	's	a	little	bit	like	the	invasion	of	the	body	snatchers	.
you	need	a	lawyer	to	run	the	company	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	so	much	law	.
but	it	's	not	just	business	that	's	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 press 	 ed 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	.
a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	was	 hik 	 ing 	 	near	cody	,	wyoming	.
it	was	in	a	 grizz 	 ly 	 	bear	preserve	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	no	one	told	me	that	before	we	went	.
and	our	guide	was	a	local	science	teacher	.
she	was	 who 	 lly 	 	 un 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	the	 bear 	 s 	 	,	but	she	was	 terr 	 ified 	 	of	 lawyer 	 s 	 	.
the	 st 	 ories 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 pour 	 ing 	 	out	.
she	'd	just	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	an	episode	where	a	parent	had	 threaten 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 ue 	 	the	school	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 lower 	 ed 	 	the	grade	of	the	student	by	10	percent	when	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	paper	in	late	.
the	principal	did	n't	want	to	stand	up	to	the	parent	 be 	 cause 	 	he	did	n't	want	to	get	 drag 	 ged 	 	 in 	 to 	 	some	legal	 proceed 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
so	,	she	had	to	go	to	 meet 	 ing 	 	after	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	same	 argument 	 s 	 	made	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
after	30	 day 	 s 	 	of	 sleep 	 less 	 	 night 	 s 	 	,	she	 final 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 it 	 ulated 	 	and	raised	the	grade	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	life	's	too	short	,	i	just	ca	n't	keep	going	with	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
about	the	same	time	,	she	was	going	to	take	two	 student 	 s 	 	to	a	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	in	laramie	,	which	is	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	away	,	and	she	was	going	to	drive	them	in	her	car	,	but	the	school	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	you	ca	n't	drive	them	in	the	car	for	 li 	 ability 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.
you	have	to	go	in	a	school	bus	.	``
so	,	they	 provide 	 d 	 	a	bus	that	held	60	people	and	drove	the	three	of	them	back	and	forth	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	to	laramie	.
her	husband	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	science	teacher	,	and	he	 take 	 s 	 	his	biology	class	on	a	 hik 	 e 	 	in	the	 near 	 by 	 	national	park	.
but	he	was	told	he	could	n't	go	on	the	 hik 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	 student 	 s 	 	in	the	class	was	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	,	so	the	other	25	 student 	 s 	 	did	n't	get	to	go	on	the	 hik 	 e 	 	either	.
at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	day	i	could	have	 fill 	 ed 	 	a	book	just	with	 st 	 ories 	 	about	law	from	 th 	 is 	 	one	teacher	.
now	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	taught	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	law	is	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	.
but	 some 	 how 	 	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	in	the	last	couple	of	 decade 	 s 	 	,	the	land	of	the	free	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	legal	 mine 	 field 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	in	ways	that	are	sort	of	 imper 	 cept 	 ible 	 	;	and	yet	,	when	you	pull	back	,	you	see	it	all	the	time	.
it	's	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	we	talk	.	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	a	 pediatric 	 ian 	 	friend	in	north	carolina	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	you	know	,	i	do	n't	deal	with	 patient 	 s 	 	the	same	way	 any 	 more 	 	.
you	would	n't	want	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	off	-	the	-	cuff	that	might	be	used	against	you	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	doctor	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	life	is	 car 	 ing 	 	for	people	.
my	own	law	firm	 ha 	 s 	 	a	list	of	 question 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	ask	when	 interview 	 ing 	 	 candid 	 ates 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ini 	 ster 	 	question	,	 bulg 	 ing 	 	with	 hid 	 den 	 	 motive 	 s 	 	and	 innu 	 endo 	 	,	``	where	are	you	from	?	``
now	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	tort	 reform 	 ers 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 sound 	 ing 	 	the	alarm	that	 law 	 suit 	 s 	 	are	out	of	control	.
and	we	read	every	once	in	while	about	these	crazy	 law 	 suit 	 s 	 	,	like	the	guy	in	the	 di 	 strict 	 	of	columbia	who	 su 	 ed 	 	his	dry	 clean 	 ers 	 	for	54	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	lost	his	pair	of	pants	.
the	case	went	on	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	;	i	think	he	's	still	 appeal 	 ing 	 	the	case	.
but	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	,	these	crazy	 case 	 s 	 	are	 relat 	 ively 	 	rare	.	they	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	win	.
and	the	total	of	direct	tort	cost	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	is	about	two	percent	,	which	is	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	in	other	 count 	 ries 	 	but	,	 a 	 s 	 	 tax 	 es 	 	go	,	 hard 	 ly 	 	 c 	 rippl 	 ing 	 	.
but	the	direct	 cost 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	the	tip	of	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	.
what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 with 	 out 	 	our	 know 	 ing 	 	,	is	our	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
people	no	 long 	 er 	 	feel	free	to	act	on	 the 	 ir 	 	best	judgment	.
so	,	what	do	we	do	about	it	?
we	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	want	to	give	up	the	 right 	 s 	 	,	when	people	do	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	,	to	seek	 re 	 dress 	 	in	the	 court 	 s 	 	.
we	need	 regulat 	 ion 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	people	do	n't	pollute	and	 s 	 uch 	 	.
we	lack	even	a	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	to	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	the	wrong	frame	of	 re 	 ference 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	trained	to	think	that	the	way	to	look	at	every	 disput 	 e 	 	,	every	issue	,	is	a	matter	of	kind	of	individual	 right 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	peer	through	a	legal	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	and	look	at	 every 	 thing 	 	.
is	it	possible	that	there	are	 ex 	 ten 	 u 	 ating 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	that	explain	why	johnny	 turn 	 ed 	 	his	paper	in	late	in	cody	,	wyoming	?
is	it	possible	that	the	doctor	might	have	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	when	the	sick	person	 get 	 s 	 	 sick 	 er 	 	?
and	of	course	the	 hind 	 sight 	 	bias	is	perfect	.
there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	a	different	scenario	that	you	can	sketch	out	where	it	's	possible	that	 some 	 thing 	 	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
and	yet	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	trained	to	 s 	 quint 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	legal	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	we	can	 judg 	 e 	 	any	 disput 	 e 	 	against	the	standard	of	a	perfect	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	where	 every 	 one 	 	will	agree	what	's	fair	,	and	where	 accident 	 s 	 	will	be	extinct	,	risk	will	be	no	more	.
of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	utopia	;	it	's	a	formula	for	 para 	 lysis 	 	,	not	 free 	 dom 	 	.
it	's	not	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	the	rule	of	law	,	it	's	not	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	a	free	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
so	,	now	i	have	the	first	of	four	 pro 	 position 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	with	you	about	how	you	 simpl 	 ify 	 	the	law	:	you	've	got	to	 judg 	 e 	 	law	 main 	 ly 	 	by	 it 	 s 	 	effect	on	the	 broad 	 er 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	not	individual	 disput 	 es 	 	.
so	,	let	's	pull	back	from	the	 anecdote 	 s 	 	for	a	second	and	look	at	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	from	high	above	.
is	it	 work 	 ing 	 	?
what	 do 	 es 	 	the	macro	-	data	show	us	?
well	,	the	 health 	 care 	 	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	:	a	culture	 pervad 	 ed 	 	with	 defensive 	 ness 	 	,	universal	 dis 	 trust 	 	of	the	system	of	justice	,	universal	practice	of	defensive	medicine	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	measure	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 mix 	 ed 	 	 motive 	 s 	 	.
 doctor 	 s 	 	can	make	more	on	 order 	 ing 	 	 test 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	even	know	what	's	right	or	wrong	.
but	 reli 	 able 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	range	between	60	billion	and	200	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	year	.
that	's	 en 	 ough 	 	to	provide	care	to	all	the	people	in	america	who	do	n't	have	it	.
the	trial	 lawyer 	 s 	 	say	,	``	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	legal	fear	 make 	 s 	 	 doctor 	 s 	 	practice	better	medicine	.	``
well	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	too	,	by	the	institute	of	medicine	and	 other 	 s 	 	.	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	's	not	the	case	.
the	fear	 ha 	 s 	 	 chill 	 ed 	 	professional	 interact 	 ion 	 	so	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	tragic	 error 	 s 	 	occur	 be 	 cause 	 	 doctor 	 s 	 	are	 af 	 raid 	 	to	speak	up	:	``	are	you	 s 	 ure 	 	that	's	the	right	 do 	 s 	 age 	 	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	not	 s 	 ure 	 	,	and	they	do	n't	want	to	take	legal	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
let	's	go	to	 school 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	saw	with	the	teacher	in	cody	,	wyoming	,	she	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	the	law	.
well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	 school 	 s 	 	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	 drown 	 ing 	 	in	law	.
you	could	have	a	 separat 	 e 	 	section	of	a	law	library	around	each	of	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	legal	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	:	due	process	,	special	education	,	no	child	left	 be 	 hind 	 	,	zero	 toler 	 ance 	 	,	work	 rule 	 s 	 	...
it	 go 	 es 	 	on	.	we	did	a	 stud 	 y 	 	of	all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	that	affect	one	school	in	new	york	.	the	board	of	ed	.	had	no	idea	.
 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	discreet	 rule 	 s 	 	,	60	 step 	 s 	 	to	suspend	a	student	from	school	:	it	's	a	formula	for	 para 	 lysis 	 	.
what	's	the	effect	of	that	?	one	is	a	decline	in	order	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	it	's	 direct 	 ly 	 	 attribut 	 able 	 	to	the	rise	of	due	process	.
public	agenda	did	a	survey	for	us	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	where	they	found	that	43	percent	of	the	high	school	 teacher 	 s 	 	in	america	say	that	they	 s 	 pend 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	half	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	 maintain 	 ing 	 	order	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 student 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	half	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	one	child	is	 disrupt 	 ing 	 	the	class	no	one	can	learn	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	the	teacher	tries	to	assert	order	?
they	're	 threaten 	 ed 	 	with	a	legal	claim	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 survey 	 ed 	 	that	.	seventy	-	eight	percent	of	the	middle	and	high	school	 teacher 	 s 	 	in	america	have	 be 	 en 	 	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 student 	 s 	 	with	 viol 	 ating 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	,	with	 law 	 suit 	 s 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 student 	 s 	 	.	they	are	 threaten 	 ing 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 student 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	that	they	 usual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ue 	 	,	it	's	not	that	they	would	win	,	but	it	's	an	 indic 	 ation 	 	of	the	 corros 	 ion 	 	of	 author 	 ity 	 	.
and	how	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	system	of	law	 work 	 ed 	 	for	government	?
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 do 	 es 	 	it	?
 n 	 either 	 	in	sacramento	nor	in	washington	.
the	other	day	at	the	state	of	the	 un 	 ion 	 	speech	,	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	i	think	we	could	all	agree	with	 th 	 is 	 	goal	,	``	from	the	first	 rail 	 road 	 s 	 	to	the	 inter 	 state 	 	 high 	 way 	 	system	,	our	nation	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	first	to	compete	.
there	is	no	reason	europe	or	 chin 	 a 	 	should	have	the	 fast 	 est 	 	 train 	 s 	 	.	``
well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	is	a	reason	:	 environment 	 al 	 	review	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	process	of	no	 pe 	 bble 	 	left	 un 	 turn 	 ed 	 	for	any	major	project	taking	the	better	part	of	a	decade	,	then	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	 year 	 s 	 	of	 litig 	 ation 	 	by	 any 	 body 	 	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	like	the	project	.
then	,	just	 stay 	 ing 	 	above	the	earth	for	one	more	second	,	people	are	 act 	 ing 	 	like	 idiot 	 s 	 	,	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	.
 idiot 	 s 	 	.	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	broward	 count 	 y 	 	,	florida	,	 bann 	 ed 	 	running	at	recess	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	all	the	 boy 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	add	.
i	mean	it	's	just	 absolute 	 ly 	 	a	formula	for	failure	.
my	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	are	all	the	 war 	 ning 	 	 label 	 s 	 	.
``	caution	:	 content 	 s 	 	are	hot	,	``	on	 billion 	 s 	 	of	coffee	 cup 	 s 	 	.
 archeo 	 logists 	 	will	dig	us	up	in	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	and	they	wo	n't	know	about	defensive	medicine	and	stuff	,	but	they	'll	see	all	these	 label 	 s 	 	,	``	 content 	 s 	 	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	hot	.	``
they	'll	think	it	was	some	kind	of	aphrodisiac	.
that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	why	would	you	have	to	tell	people	that	 some 	 thing 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	hot	?
my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 war 	 ning 	 	was	one	on	a	five	-	inch	 fish 	 ing 	 	lure	.
i	grew	up	in	the	south	and	 while 	 d 	 	away	the	 summer 	 s 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	.
five	-	inch	 fish 	 ing 	 	lure	,	it	's	a	big	 fish 	 ing 	 	lure	,	with	a	three	pronged	hook	in	the	back	,	and	 out 	 side 	 	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 harm 	 ful 	 	if	 swallow 	 ed 	 	.	``
so	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	think	is	right	.
and	why	not	?	they	do	n't	trust	the	law	.	why	do	n't	they	trust	the	law	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	worst	of	both	 world 	 s 	 	:	it	's	random	--	 any 	 body 	 	can	 s 	 ue 	 	for	 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	and	take	it	to	a	jury	,	not	even	an	effort	at	 consist 	 ency 	 	--	and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	too	 detail 	 ed 	 	.
in	the	 area 	 s 	 	that	are	 regulat 	 ed 	 	,	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	no	human	could	possibly	know	it	.
well	how	do	you	fix	it	?	we	could	 s 	 pend 	 	10,000	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	prune	 th 	 is 	 	legal	jungle	.
but	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	here	is	not	one	of	just	 amend 	 ing 	 	the	law	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	hurdle	for	success	is	trust	.
people	--	for	law	to	be	the	platform	for	 free 	 dom 	 	,	people	have	to	trust	it	.
so	,	that	's	my	second	 pro 	 position 	 	:	trust	is	an	essential	condition	to	a	free	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
life	is	 complic 	 ated 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	 with 	 out 	 	legal	fear	.
but	law	is	different	than	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 certain 	 ties 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 car 	 ries 	 	with	it	the	power	of	state	.
and	so	the	state	can	come	in	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 change 	 s 	 	the	way	people	think	.
it	's	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	little	lawyer	on	your	 shoulder 	 s 	 	all	day	long	,	 whisper 	 ing 	 	in	your	ear	,	``	could	that	go	wrong	?	might	that	go	wrong	?	``
it	 drive 	 s 	 	people	from	the	smart	part	of	the	brain	--	that	dark	,	deep	well	of	the	 sub 	 conscious 	 	,	where	 instinct 	 s 	 	and	experience	,	and	all	the	other	 factor 	 s 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	good	judgment	are	--	it	 drive 	 s 	 	us	to	the	thin	 vene 	 er 	 	of	conscious	logic	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	the	doctor	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	,	i	doubt	if	that	 head 	 ache 	 	could	be	a	tumor	,	but	who	would	protect	me	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	?	so	 may 	 be 	 	i	'll	just	order	the	mri	.	``
then	you	've	 waste 	 d 	 	200	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 un 	 necess 	 ary 	 	 test 	 s 	 	.

so	,	what	's	 need 	 ed 	 	is	not	just	to	limit	 claim 	 s 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	a	dry	ground	of	 free 	 dom 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 free 	 dom 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 form 	 al 	 	structure	.
and	it	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	law	 set 	 s 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	,	and	on	one	side	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	are	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	do	or	must	do	--	you	ca	n't	steal	,	you	've	got	to	pay	your	 tax 	 es 	 	--	but	 t 	 hose 	 	same	 bound 	 aries 	 	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	define	and	protect	a	dry	ground	of	 free 	 dom 	 	.
isaiah	berlin	put	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	:	``	law	 set 	 s 	 	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	,	not	 artificial 	 ly 	 	drawn	,	 with 	 in 	 	which	men	 s 	 hall 	 	be	 in 	 viol 	 able 	 	.	``
we	've	 for 	 gotten 	 	that	second	part	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 dike 	 s 	 	have	burst	.	people	 wa 	 de 	 	through	law	all	day	long	.
so	,	what	's	 need 	 ed 	 	now	is	to	 re 	 build 	 	these	 bound 	 aries 	 	.
and	it	's	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 re 	 build 	 	them	for	 law 	 suit 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	people	can	 s 	 ue 	 	for	 establish 	 es 	 	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	for	 every 	 body 	 	else	's	 free 	 dom 	 	.
if	 some 	 one 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	a	 law 	 suit 	 	over	,	``	a	kid	fell	off	the	seesaw	,	``	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	 law 	 suit 	 	,	all	the	 seesaw 	 s 	 	will	disappear	.
 be 	 cause 	 	no	one	will	want	to	take	the	risk	of	a	 law 	 suit 	 	.
and	that	's	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	there	are	no	 seesaw 	 s 	 	,	jungle	 gym 	 s 	 	,	merry	-	go	-	 round 	 s 	 	,	 climb 	 ing 	 	 rope 	 s 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	would	interest	a	kid	over	the	age	of	four	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	risk	 associate 	 d 	 	with	it	.
so	,	how	do	we	 re 	 build 	 	it	?
life	is	too	complex	for	...
life	is	too	complex	for	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	program	.
all	these	 choice 	 s 	 	involve	value	 judgment 	 s 	 	and	social	 norm 	 s 	 	,	not	 object 	 ive 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	.
and	so	here	is	the	fourth	 pro 	 position 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	have	,	the	 philosoph 	 y 	 	we	have	to	change	to	.
and	there	are	two	essential	 element 	 s 	 	of	it	:	we	have	to	 simpl 	 ify 	 	the	law	.
we	have	to	 migr 	 ate 	 	from	all	 th 	 is 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	general	 principle 	 s 	 	and	 goal 	 s 	 	.
the	 constit 	 ution 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	16	 page 	 s 	 	long	.
 work 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	for	200	 year 	 s 	 	.
law	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	simple	 en 	 ough 	 	so	that	people	can	 internal 	 ize 	 	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	.
if	they	ca	n't	 internal 	 ize 	 	it	,	they	wo	n't	trust	it	.
and	how	do	you	make	it	simple	?
 be 	 cause 	 	life	is	complex	,	and	here	is	the	 hard 	 est 	 	and	 big 	 gest 	 	change	:	we	have	to	 re 	 store 	 	the	 author 	 ity 	 	to	 judg 	 es 	 	and	 official 	 s 	 	to	interpret	and	 app 	 ly 	 	the	law	.
we	have	to	 re 	 human 	 ize 	 	the	law	.
to	make	law	simple	so	that	you	feel	free	,	the	people	in	charge	have	to	be	free	to	use	 the 	 ir 	 	judgment	to	interpret	and	 app 	 ly 	 	the	law	in	accord	with	 reason 	 able 	 	social	 norm 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	're	going	down	,	and	 walk 	 ing 	 	down	the	 side 	 walk 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	you	have	to	think	that	if	there	is	a	 disput 	 e 	 	,	there	's	 some 	 body 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	who	 s 	 ees 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	job	to	 affirm 	 ative 	 ly 	 	protect	you	if	you	're	 act 	 ing 	 	 reason 	 ably 	 	.
that	person	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 hard 	 est 	 	hurdle	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.	ninety	-	eight	percent	of	 case 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	piece	of	cake	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	've	got	a	claim	in	small	 claim 	 s 	 	court	for	your	lost	pair	of	pants	for	$	100	,	but	not	in	a	court	of	general	jurisdiction	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
case	 dismiss 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	prejudice	or	 re 	 filing 	 	in	small	 claim 	 s 	 	court	.
 take 	 s 	 	five	 minute 	 s 	 	.	that	's	it	,	it	's	not	that	hard	.
but	it	's	a	hard	hurdle	 be 	 cause 	 	we	got	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	legal	 quick 	 sand 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 wok 	 e 	 	up	in	the	1960s	to	all	these	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	 value 	 s 	 	:	 rac 	 ism 	 	,	gender	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	,	 poll 	 ution 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	bad	 value 	 s 	 	.	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	a	legal	system	where	no	one	could	have	bad	 value 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
the	problem	is	,	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	system	where	we	 eliminate 	 d 	 	the	right	to	have	good	 value 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	people	in	 author 	 ity 	 	can	do	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	.
they	're	still	 bound 	 ed 	 	by	legal	 goal 	 s 	 	and	 principle 	 s 	 	:	the	teacher	is	 account 	 able 	 	to	the	principal	,	the	 judg 	 e 	 	is	 account 	 able 	 	to	an	 app 	 ell 	 ate 	 	court	,	the	 p 	 resident 	 	is	 account 	 able 	 	to	 vot 	 ers 	 	.
but	the	 account 	 ability 	 	's	up	the	line	 judg 	 ing 	 	the	decision	against	the	effect	on	 every 	 body 	 	,	not	just	on	the	 dis 	 grunt 	 led 	 	person	.
you	ca	n't	run	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	by	the	 low 	 est 	 	common	 denomi 	 nator 	 	.
so	,	what	's	 need 	 ed 	 	is	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	shift	in	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
we	can	pull	the	plug	on	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	if	we	shift	our	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	taught	that	 author 	 ity 	 	is	the	 ene 	 my 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	.
it	's	not	true	.	 author 	 ity 	 	,	in	fact	,	is	essential	to	 free 	 dom 	 	.
law	is	a	human	institution	;	 respons 	 ibility 	 	is	a	human	institution	.
if	 teacher 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	 author 	 ity 	 	to	run	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	to	maintain	order	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	 learn 	 ing 	 	 suffer 	 s 	 	.
if	the	 judg 	 e 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	the	 author 	 ity 	 	to	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	out	 un 	 reason 	 able 	 	 claim 	 s 	 	,	then	all	of	us	go	through	the	day	looking	over	our	 shoulder 	 s 	 	.
if	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	ca	n't	decide	that	the	power	lines	are	good	for	the	environment	,	then	there	's	no	way	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	power	from	the	wind	 farm 	 s 	 	to	the	city	.
a	free	 socie 	 ty 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	red	 light 	 s 	 	and	green	 light 	 s 	 	,	 other 	 wise 	 	it	soon	 descend 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 grid 	 lock 	 	.
that	's	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	america	.	look	around	.
what	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	is	to	 re 	 store 	 	the	 author 	 ity 	 	to	make	common	 choice 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	get	our	 free 	 dom 	 	back	,	and	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	 re 	 lease 	 	the	energy	and	 pass 	 ion 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	so	that	we	can	meet	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	our	time	.	thank	you	.
