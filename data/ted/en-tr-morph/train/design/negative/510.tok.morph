i	am	going	to	talk	about	 my 	 self 	 	,	which	i	 rare 	 ly 	 	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	--	well	for	one	thing	,	i	prefer	to	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	i	know	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	.
and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	a	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	narcissist	.
i	did	n't	know	i	was	a	narcissist	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
i	thought	 nar 	 cis 	 s 	 ism 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	you	 love 	 d 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	then	 some 	 one 	 	told	me	there	is	a	flip	side	to	it	.
so	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 rear 	 ier 	 	than	self	-	love	;	it	's	 un 	 re 	 quit 	 ed 	 	self	-	love	.
i	do	n't	feel	i	can	afford	a	 re 	 lapse 	 	.
but	i	want	to	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	explain	how	i	came	to	design	my	own	 part 	 icular 	 	brand	of	 come 	 dy 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	through	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	 form 	 s 	 	of	it	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	improvisation	,	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	form	of	improvisation	 call 	 ed 	 	theater	 game 	 s 	 	,	which	had	one	rule	,	which	i	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	was	a	great	rule	for	an	ethic	for	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	the	rule	was	,	you	could	n't	 den 	 y 	 	the	other	person	's	 re 	 ality 	 	,	you	could	 on 	 ly 	 	build	on	it	.
and	of	course	we	live	in	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	's	all	about	 contradict 	 ing 	 	other	 people 	 s 	 	'	 re 	 ality 	 	.
it	's	all	about	 contradict 	 ion 	 	,	which	i	think	is	why	i	'm	so	sensitive	to	 contradict 	 ion 	 	in	general	.
i	see	it	 every 	 where 	 	.
like	 poll 	 s 	 	.	you	know	,	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	to	me	that	in	public	opinion	 poll 	 s 	 	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	americans	who	do	n't	know	the	answer	to	any	 give 	 n 	 	question	is	 al 	 ways 	 	two	percent	.
75	percent	of	americans	think	alaska	is	part	of	canada	.
but	 on 	 ly 	 	two	percent	do	n't	know	the	effect	that	the	 deb 	 acle 	 	in	argentina	will	have	on	the	imf	's	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	policy	--	 seem 	 s 	 	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	.
or	 th 	 is 	 	ad	that	i	read	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	:	``	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	fine	watch	 speak 	 s 	 	 loud 	 ly 	 	of	your	rank	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 buy 	 ing 	 	it	from	us	 s 	 cream 	 s 	 	good	taste	.	``
or	 th 	 is 	 	that	i	found	in	a	magazine	 call 	 ed 	 	california	lawyer	,	in	an	article	that	is	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	for	the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	at	enron	.
``	 surviv 	 ing 	 	the	slammer	:	do	's	and	 do 	 n't 	 s 	 	.	``
``	do	n't	use	big	 word 	 s 	 	.	``
``	learn	the	 lin 	 gua 	 	 franc 	 a 	 	.	``
 yea 	 h 	 	.	``	 lin 	 gua 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	frankie	.	``
and	i	suppose	it	's	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	that	i	talk	about	science	when	i	do	n't	know	math	.
you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	--	and	by	the	way	to	i	was	so	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	to	dean	kamen	for	 point 	 ing 	 	out	that	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	,	that	there	are	cultural	 reason 	 s 	 	that	women	and	 minor 	 ities 	 	do	n't	enter	the	 field 	 s 	 	of	science	and	technology	--	 be 	 cause 	 	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	the	reason	i	do	n't	do	math	is	,	i	was	taught	to	do	math	and	read	at	the	same	time	.
so	you	're	six	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	you	're	 read 	 ing 	 	snow	white	and	the	seven	 d 	 war 	 ves 	 	,	and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	obvious	that	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	men	in	the	world	:	 d 	 war 	 ves 	 	and	prince	charmings	.
and	the	 odd 	 s 	 	are	seven	to	one	against	your	 find 	 ing 	 	the	prince	.
that	's	why	little	 girl 	 s 	 	do	n't	do	math	.	it	's	too	 depress 	 ing 	 	.
of	course	,	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	science	i	 al 	 so 	 	may	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	the	other	night	,	incur	the	violent	wrath	of	some	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	with	me	.
i	used	the	word	 post 	 modern 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	ok	.
and	they	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	.
one	of	them	,	to	his	credit	,	i	think	 re 	 ally 	 	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	engage	me	in	a	serious	argument	.
but	i	do	n't	engage	in	serious	 argument 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	 ap 	 prove 	 	of	them	 be 	 cause 	 	 argument 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	are	all	about	 contradict 	 ion 	 	,	and	they	're	shaped	by	the	 value 	 s 	 	that	i	have	 question 	 s 	 	with	.
i	have	 question 	 s 	 	with	the	 value 	 s 	 	of	newtonian	science	,	like	 rational 	 ity 	 	.	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	rational	in	an	argument	.
well	 rational 	 ity 	 	is	 construct 	 ed 	 	by	what	christie	hefner	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	mind	-	body	split	,	you	know	?
the	head	is	good	,	body	bad	.
head	is	ego	,	body	id	.
when	we	say	``	i	,	``	--	 a 	 s 	 	when	rene	descartes	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	think	 there 	 fore 	 	i	am	,	``	--	we	mean	the	head	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	david	lee	roth	 s 	 ang 	 	in	``	just	a	 gig 	 olo 	 	,	``	``	i	ai	n't	got	no	body	.	``
that	's	how	you	get	 rational 	 ity 	 	.
and	that	's	why	so	much	of	humor	is	the	body	 assert 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	against	the	head	.
that	's	why	you	have	toilet	humor	and	sexual	humor	.
that	's	why	you	have	the	raspyni	 brother 	 s 	 	 whack 	 ing 	 	richard	in	the	genital	area	.
and	we	're	 laugh 	 ing 	 	 doub 	 ly 	 	then	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	the	body	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	--	voice	 off 	 stage 	 	:	richard	.
emily	levine	:	richard	.	what	did	i	say	?
richard	.	 y 	 es 	 	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	head	,	the	head	of	the	 con 	 ference 	 	.
that	's	the	other	way	that	humor	--	like	art	buchwald	 take 	 s 	 	 shot 	 s 	 	at	the	 head 	 s 	 	of	state	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	money	 a 	 s 	 	body	humor	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	--	but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	 treasu 	 re 	 	you	and	 ador 	 e 	 	you	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	in	 rational 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	 th 	 ough 	 	,	which	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	revere	the	head	,	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	anti	-	intellectual	.
i	know	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	read	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	the	ayn	rand	 found 	 ation 	 	took	out	a	full	-	page	ad	after	september	11	,	in	which	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	problem	is	not	 ir 	 aq 	 	or	iran	,	the	problem	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	facing	 th 	 is 	 	country	is	the	university	 professor 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	spawn	.	``
so	i	went	back	and	re	-	read	``	the	fountainhead	.	``
i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	read	it	.
and	i	'm	not	an	expert	on	 sadomasoch 	 ism 	 	.
but	let	me	just	read	you	a	couple	of	random	 pass 	 age 	 s 	 	from	page	217	.
``	the	act	of	a	master	taking	 pain 	 ful 	 	 con 	 tempt 	 uous 	 	 possess 	 ion 	 	of	her	,	was	the	kind	of	 rap 	 ture 	 	she	 want 	 ed 	 	.
when	they	lay	together	in	bed	it	was	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	had	to	be	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	nature	of	the	act	 demand 	 ed 	 	,	an	act	of	violence	.
it	was	an	act	of	 clench 	 ed 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	and	hatred	.	it	was	the	 un 	 endur 	 able 	 	.
not	a	 care 	 s 	 s 	 	,	but	a	wave	of	pain	.
the	 agon 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	act	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	.	``
so	you	can	imagine	my	surprise	on	 read 	 ing 	 	in	the	new	yorker	that	alan	greenspan	,	 chair 	 man 	 	of	the	federal	 re 	 serve 	 	,	 claim 	 s 	 	ayn	rand	 a 	 s 	 	his	intellectual	mentor	.
it	's	like	 find 	 ing 	 	out	your	 nann 	 y 	 	is	a	 domin 	 atrix 	 	.
bad	 en 	 ough 	 	we	had	to	see	j.	edgar	 ho 	 over 	 	in	a	dress	.
now	we	have	to	picture	alan	greenspan	in	a	black	leather	 cor 	 set 	 	,	with	a	butt	tattoo	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	whip	 infla 	 tion 	 	now	.	``
and	ayn	rand	of	course	,	ayn	rand	is	famous	for	a	 philosoph 	 y 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	objectivism	,	which	 reflect 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	value	of	newtonian	physics	,	which	is	 object 	 ivity 	 	.
 object 	 ivity 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	is	 construct 	 ed 	 	in	that	same	s	&	m	way	.
it	's	the	subject	 sub 	 jug 	 ating 	 	the	object	.
that	's	how	you	assert	 your 	 self 	 	.
you	make	 your 	 self 	 	the	active	voice	.
and	the	object	is	the	 pass 	 ive 	 	no	-	voice	.
i	was	so	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	that	oxygen	commercial	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	but	--	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	different	now	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	making	a	 state 	 ment 	 	--	but	in	 man 	 y 	 	hospital	 nurse 	 ries 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	,	 un 	 til 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 any 	 way 	 	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	a	book	by	jessica	benjamin	,	the	 sign 	 s 	 	over	the	little	 boy 	 s 	 	 crib 	 s 	 	read	,	``	i	'm	a	boy	,	``	and	the	 sign 	 s 	 	over	the	little	 girl 	 s 	 	 crib 	 s 	 	read	,	``	it	's	a	girl	.	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.
so	the	 pass 	 ivity 	 	was	 cultural 	 ly 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	onto	the	little	 girl 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	still	 go 	 es 	 	on	 a 	 s 	 	i	think	i	told	you	last	year	.
there	's	a	poll	that	 prove 	 s 	 	--	there	was	a	poll	that	was	 give 	 n 	 	by	time	magazine	,	in	which	 on 	 ly 	 	men	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	have	you	ever	had	 s 	 ex 	 	with	a	woman	you	 active 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 like 	 d 	 	?	``
and	well	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
well	,	58	percent	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	,	which	i	think	is	 over 	 inflated 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	men	if	you	just	say	,	``	have	you	ever	had	 s 	 ex 	 	...	``	``	 y 	 es 	 	!	``
they	do	n't	even	wait	for	the	rest	of	it	.
and	of	course	two	percent	did	not	know	 whet 	 her 	 	they	'd	had	--	that	's	the	first	 call 	 back 	 	,	of	my	 attempt 	 ed 	 	quadruple	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	subject	-	object	thing	,	is	part	of	 some 	 thing 	 	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 politic 	 al 	 	 correct 	 ness 	 	.
i	do	.	i	think	it	can	go	too	far	.
i	think	ringling	 brother 	 s 	 	may	have	gone	too	far	with	an	ad	they	took	out	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	magazine	.
``	we	have	a	 life 	 long 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	and	financial	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	our	asian	elephant	 partner 	 s 	 	.	``
 may 	 be 	 	too	far	.	but	you	know	--	i	do	n't	think	that	a	person	of	color	making	 f 	 un 	 	of	white	people	is	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	white	person	making	 f 	 un 	 	of	people	of	color	.
or	women	making	 f 	 un 	 	of	men	is	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	men	making	 f 	 un 	 	of	women	.
or	poor	people	making	 f 	 un 	 	of	rich	people	,	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	rich	people	.
i	think	you	can	make	 f 	 un 	 	of	the	have	but	not	the	have	-	nots	,	which	is	why	you	do	n't	see	me	making	 f 	 un 	 	of	kenneth	lay	and	his	 charm 	 ing 	 	wife	.
what	's	funny	about	 be 	 ing 	 	down	to	four	 house 	 s 	 	?
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 less 	 on 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 ex 	 	 scandal 	 s 	 	of	the	clinton	 administr 	 ation 	 	or	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	i	call	them	,	the	good	ol	'	 day 	 s 	 	.
when	people	i	 k 	 new 	 	,	you	know	,	people	who	 consider 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	liberal	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	,	 we 	 re 	 	making	 f 	 un 	 	of	jennifer	 flower 	 s 	 	and	paula	jones	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	making	 f 	 un 	 	of	them	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 trail 	 er 	 	trash	or	white	trash	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	,	i	suppose	,	a	 harm 	 less 	 	prejudice	and	that	you	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 hurt 	 ing 	 	 any 	 body 	 	.
 un 	 til 	 	you	read	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	,	an	ad	in	the	los	angeles	 time 	 s 	 	.
``	for	sale	:	white	trash	 compact 	 or 	 	.	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	whole	subject	-	object	thing	 ha 	 s 	 	relevance	to	humor	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
i	read	a	book	by	a	woman	named	amy	richlin	,	who	is	the	chair	of	the	 classic 	 s 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	at	usc	.
and	the	book	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	garden	of	priapus	.	``
and	she	 say 	 s 	 	that	roman	humor	 mirror 	 s 	 	the	construction	of	roman	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
so	that	roman	 socie 	 ty 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	top	/	bottom	,	 a 	 s 	 	 our 	 s 	 	is	to	some	degree	.
and	so	was	humor	.
there	 al 	 ways 	 	had	to	be	the	butt	of	a	joke	.
so	it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	the	 sati 	 r 	 ist 	 	,	like	juvenal	or	 mar 	 tial 	 	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	the	audience	,	and	he	was	going	to	make	 f 	 un 	 	of	the	 out 	 sider 	 	,	the	person	who	did	n't	share	that	subject	 stat 	 us 	 	.
and	in	stand	-	up	of	course	,	the	stand	-	up	comedian	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	dominate	the	audience	.
a	lot	of	 heck 	 ling 	 	is	the	tension	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	comedian	is	going	to	be	able	to	dominate	,	and	 over 	 come 	 	the	 heck 	 ler 	 	.
and	i	got	good	at	that	when	i	was	in	stand	up	.
but	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 hat 	 ed 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 dict 	 ating 	 	the	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	in	the	same	way	that	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	a	serious	argument	 determine 	 s 	 	the	content	,	to	some	degree	,	of	what	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
and	i	was	looking	for	a	form	that	did	n't	have	that	.
and	so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	more	 inter 	 active 	 	.
i	know	that	word	is	so	 de 	 based 	 	now	by	the	use	of	it	by	 inter 	 net 	 	 market 	 ers 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	 mis 	 s 	 	the	old	 tele 	 market 	 ers 	 	now	,	i	'll	tell	you	that	.
i	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	there	you	stood	a	chance	.	you	know	?
i	used	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	hang	up	on	them	.
but	then	i	read	in	``	dear	abby	``	that	that	was	rude	.
so	the	next	time	that	one	 call 	 ed 	 	i	let	him	get	 half 	 way 	 	through	his	 spi 	 el 	 	and	then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	sound	sexy	.	``
he	hung	up	on	me	!
but	the	 inter 	 activity 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	the	audience	to	shape	what	you	're	going	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	you	shape	 the 	 ir 	 	experience	of	the	world	.
and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	'm	looking	for	.
and	i	was	sort	of	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	it	is	that	i	do	,	i	read	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 trick 	 ster 	 	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	``	by	lewis	hyde	.
and	it	was	like	 be 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 analyz 	 ed 	 	.
i	mean	he	had	laid	it	all	out	.
and	then	coming	to	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	most	 every 	 body 	 	here	 share 	 d 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	same	 qual 	 ities 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 trick 	 ster 	 	is	is	an	agent	of	change	.
 trick 	 ster 	 	is	a	change	agent	.
and	the	 qual 	 ities 	 	that	i	'm	about	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	are	the	 qual 	 ities 	 	that	make	it	possible	to	make	change	happen	.
and	one	of	these	is	 bound 	 ary 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	so	,	in	fact	,	 infuri 	 ated 	 	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
but	i	like	to	cross	 bound 	 aries 	 	.
i	like	to	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	i	know	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	.
i	hope	that	's	my	agent	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	n't	 pay 	 ing 	 	me	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	think	it	's	good	to	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	i	know	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 br 	 ing 	 	a	fresh	 view 	 point 	 	to	it	,	you	know	?
i	'm	able	to	see	the	 contradict 	 ion 	 	that	you	may	not	be	able	to	see	.
like	for	 in 	 stance 	 	a	 mim 	 e 	 	once	--	or	a	meme	 a 	 s 	 	he	 call 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.

it	 on 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	to	learn	how	to	talk	.
and	you	know	people	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	problem	with	quote	,	 object 	 ivity 	 	,	 un 	 quote 	 	.
when	you	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	people	who	speak	the	same	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	,	or	share	the	same	set	of	 assumption 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	,	you	start	to	think	that	that	's	 re 	 ality 	 	.
like	 economist 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 the 	 ir 	 	definition	of	rational	,	that	we	all	act	out	of	our	own	economic	self	-	interest	.
well	,	look	at	michael	hawley	,	or	look	at	dean	kamen	,	or	look	at	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
my	 grand 	 mother 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 act 	 ed 	 	in	other	people	's	 interest 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	her	to	or	not	.
if	they	had	had	an	olympics	in	 martyr 	 dom 	 	,	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	would	have	lost	on	purpose	.
``	no	,	you	take	the	prize	.
you	're	young	.	i	'm	old	.	who	's	going	to	see	it	?
where	am	i	going	?	i	'm	going	to	die	soon	.	``
so	that	's	one	--	 th 	 is 	 	 bound 	 ary 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	go	-	between	which	--	fritz	lanting	,	is	that	his	name	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	was	a	go	-	between	.
that	's	an	actual	quality	of	the	 trick 	 ster 	 	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	is	,	non	-	oppositional	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 contradict 	 ion 	 	.
where	you	 den 	 y 	 	the	other	person	's	 re 	 ality 	 	,	you	have	paradox	where	you	allow	more	than	one	 re 	 ality 	 	to	 co 	 exist 	 	,	i	think	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	construction	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	what	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	.
but	my	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	it	is	a	sign	that	i	saw	in	a	 jewel 	 ry 	 	store	.
it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ear 	 s 	 	 pierc 	 ed 	 	while	you	wait	.	``
there	the	 alter 	 native 	 	just	 boggl 	 es 	 	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
``	oh	no	.	 thank 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	them	here	.	 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
i	have	some	 er 	 rand 	 s 	 	to	run	.	so	i	'll	be	back	to	pick	them	up	around	five	,	if	that	's	ok	with	you	.
huh	?	huh	?	what	?	ca	n't	hear	you	.	``
and	 an 	 other 	 	 attribut 	 e 	 	of	the	 trick 	 ster 	 	is	smart	luck	.
that	 accident 	 s 	 	,	that	louis	kahn	,	who	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 accident 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	quality	of	the	 trick 	 ster 	 	.
the	 trick 	 ster 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mind	that	is	prepared	for	the	 un 	 prepared 	 	.
that	,	and	i	will	say	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	that	the	 trick 	 ster 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	ability	to	hold	his	 idea 	 s 	 	 light 	 ly 	 	so	that	he	can	let	room	in	for	new	 idea 	 s 	 	or	to	see	the	 contradict 	 ions 	 	or	the	 hid 	 den 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	i	had	no	joke	for	that	.
i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	place	.
but	here	's	how	i	think	i	like	to	make	change	,	and	that	is	in	making	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	tend	to	see	 al 	 most 	 	more	than	 contradict 	 ions 	 	.
like	the	,	what	do	you	call	 t 	 hose 	 	 to 	 es 	 	of	the	gecko	?
you	know	,	the	 to 	 es 	 	of	the	gecko	,	 curl 	 ing 	 	and	 un 	 curl 	 ing 	 	like	the	 finger 	 s 	 	of	michael	moschen	.
i	love	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
like	i	'll	read	that	one	of	the	two	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	matter	in	the	newtonian	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	there	are	two	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	matter	in	the	newtonian	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	one	is	space	occupancy	.	matter	 take 	 s 	 	up	space	.
i	guess	the	more	you	matter	the	more	space	you	take	up	,	which	 explain 	 s 	 	the	whole	suv	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
and	the	other	one	 th 	 ough 	 	is	 impenetr 	 ability 	 	.
well	,	in	ancient	rome	,	 impenetr 	 ability 	 	was	the	 cri 	 ter 	 ion 	 	of	 mascu 	 lin 	 ity 	 	.
 mascu 	 lin 	 ity 	 	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	you	 be 	 ing 	 	the	active	 penet 	 rator 	 	.
and	then	,	in	 economic 	 s 	 	,	there	's	an	active	 produce 	 r 	 	and	a	 pass 	 ive 	 	consumer	,	which	 explain 	 s 	 	why	business	 al 	 ways 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	penetrate	new	 market 	 s 	 	.
well	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	mean	why	we	 force 	 d 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	to	open	her	 market 	 s 	 	.
and	did	n't	that	feel	good	?
and	now	we	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 penetrate 	 d 	 	.
you	know	the	 bio 	 tech 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	 in 	 side 	 	us	and	 plant 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 flag 	 s 	 	on	our	 gene 	 s 	 	.
you	know	we	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 penetrate 	 d 	 	.
and	i	suspect	,	by	 some 	 one 	 	who	 active 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 like 	 s 	 	us	.
that	's	the	second	of	the	quadruple	.
 y 	 es 	 	of	course	you	got	that	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
i	still	have	a	way	to	go	.
and	what	i	hope	to	do	,	when	i	make	these	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	is	short	circuit	people	's	 think 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	make	you	not	follow	your	usual	train	of	 associ 	 ation 	 	,	but	make	you	 re 	 wire 	 	.
it	 liter 	 ally 	 	--	when	people	say	about	the	shock	of	 re 	 cognition 	 	,	it	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	re	-	cognition	,	 re 	 wiring 	 	how	you	think	--	i	had	a	joke	to	go	with	 th 	 is 	 	and	i	 for 	 got 	 	it	.
i	'm	so	sorry	.	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	like	the	woman	in	that	joke	about	--	have	you	heard	 th 	 is 	 	joke	about	the	woman	 driv 	 ing 	 	with	her	mother	?
and	the	mother	is	 elder 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	mother	 go 	 es 	 	right	through	a	red	light	.
and	the	daughter	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	to	say	 any 	 thing 	 	.
she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	to	be	like	,	``	you	're	too	old	to	drive	.	``
and	the	mother	 go 	 es 	 	through	a	second	red	light	.
and	the	daughter	 say 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 tact 	 fully 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	``	mom	,	are	you	aware	that	you	just	went	through	two	red	 light 	 s 	 	?	``
and	the	mother	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	!	am	i	 driv 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	that	's	the	shock	of	 re 	 cognition 	 	at	the	shock	of	 re 	 cognition 	 	.
that	 complete 	 s 	 	the	quadruple	.
i	just	want	to	say	two	more	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	is	,	 an 	 other 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	of	 trick 	 ster 	 	is	that	the	 trick 	 ster 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	walk	 th 	 is 	 	fine	line	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	poise	.
and	you	know	the	 big 	 gest 	 	hurdle	for	me	,	in	 do 	 ing 	 	what	i	do	,	is	 construct 	 ing 	 	my	performance	so	that	it	's	prepared	and	 un 	 prepared 	 	.
 find 	 ing 	 	the	balance	between	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	might	tip	off	too	much	in	the	direction	of	 un 	 prepared 	 	.
but	 be 	 ing 	 	too	prepared	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	room	for	the	 accident 	 s 	 	to	happen	.
i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	moshe	safdie	 s 	 aid 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	about	 beaut 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	in	his	book	,	hyde	 say 	 s 	 	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 trick 	 ster 	 	can	tip	over	 in 	 to 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
but	to	do	that	you	have	to	lose	all	the	other	 qual 	 ities 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	once	you	're	 in 	 to 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	you	're	 in 	 to 	 	a	 finish 	 ed 	 	thing	.
you	're	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 occu 	 pies 	 	space	and	 inhabit 	 s 	 	time	.
it	's	an	actual	thing	.
and	it	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	to	see	a	thing	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
but	if	you	do	n't	do	that	,	if	you	allow	for	the	accident	to	keep	on	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	you	have	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	on	a	 wave 	 length 	 	.
i	like	to	think	of	what	i	do	 a 	 s 	 	a	 prob 	 ability 	 	wave	.
when	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	wave	 collapse 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	like	to	explore	all	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	in	the	hope	that	you	'll	be	on	the	 wave 	 length 	 	of	your	audience	.
and	the	one	final	quality	i	want	to	say	about	 trick 	 ster 	 	is	that	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	home	.
he	's	 al 	 ways 	 	on	the	road	.
i	want	to	say	to	you	richard	,	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	that	in	ted	you	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	home	.
and	thank	you	for	 invit 	 ing 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
