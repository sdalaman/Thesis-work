i	'm	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	,	a	professor	at	the	university	of	california	.
and	over	the	past	35	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 stud 	 ied 	 	behavior	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	from	 gene 	 s 	 	through	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 s 	 	,	dopamine	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	all	the	way	through	circuit	analysis	.
so	that	's	what	i	 normal 	 ly 	 	do	.
but	then	,	for	some	reason	,	i	got	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	all	grew	out	of	one	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	a	bunch	of	 brain 	 s 	 	of	 psychopath 	 ic 	 	 killer 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	the	typical	talk	i	would	give	.
and	the	question	is	,	``	how	do	you	end	up	with	a	 psychopath 	 ic 	 	killer	?	``
what	i	mean	by	 psychopath 	 ic 	 	killer	are	these	people	,	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	people	.
and	so	some	of	the	 brain 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 stud 	 ied 	 	are	people	you	know	about	.
when	i	get	the	 brain 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	know	what	i	'm	looking	at	.
it	's	blind	 experiment 	 s 	 	.	they	 al 	 so 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	normal	people	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
so	i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	about	70	of	these	.
and	what	came	up	was	a	number	of	 piece 	 s 	 	of	data	.
so	we	look	at	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	,	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	and	brain	damage	,	and	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	environment	,	and	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	that	machine	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	in	the	brain	,	and	what	's	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	the	brain	.
so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	of	 gene 	 s 	 	,	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 epi 	 genetic 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	,	brain	damage	,	and	environment	,	and	how	these	are	 ti 	 ed 	 	together	.
and	how	you	end	up	with	a	psychopath	,	and	a	killer	,	 depend 	 s 	 	on	 exact 	 ly 	 	when	the	damage	 occur 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	 time 	 d 	 	thing	.
you	get	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 psychopath 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	going	 a 	 long 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	here	's	,	just	to	give	you	the	pattern	.
the	pattern	is	that	 t 	 hose 	 	people	,	every	one	of	them	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	,	who	was	a	 murder 	 er 	 	,	and	was	a	 s 	 erial 	 	killer	,	had	damage	to	 the 	 ir 	 	orbital	cortex	,	which	is	right	above	the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	the	 orbit 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 in 	 terior 	 	part	of	the	temporal	lobe	.
so	there	is	the	pattern	that	every	one	of	them	had	,	but	they	all	 we 	 re 	 	a	little	different	too	.
they	had	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	brain	damage	.
a	key	thing	is	that	the	major	violence	 gene 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	mao	-	a	gene	.
and	there	is	a	 vari 	 ant 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	gene	that	is	in	the	normal	population	.
some	of	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	it	's	 s 	 ex 	 	-	linked	.
it	's	on	the	x	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.	and	so	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	get	it	from	your	mother	.
and	in	fact	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	why	 most 	 ly 	 	men	,	 boy 	 s 	 	,	are	 psychopath 	 ic 	 	 killer 	 s 	 	,	or	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	a	daughter	can	get	one	x	from	the	father	,	one	x	from	the	mother	,	it	's	kind	of	 di 	 lute 	 d 	 	out	.
but	for	a	son	,	he	can	 on 	 ly 	 	get	the	x	 chromosom 	 e 	 	from	his	mother	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	's	 pass 	 ed 	 	from	mother	to	son	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	too	much	brain	serotonin	 dur 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	which	is	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	serotonin	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	make	you	calm	and	 relax 	 ed 	 	.
but	if	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	gene	,	in	 ut 	 ero 	 	your	brain	is	 bath 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	your	whole	brain	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 sensitive 	 	to	serotonin	,	so	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 lat 	 er 	 	on	in	life	.
and	i	'd	 give 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	talk	in	israel	,	just	 th 	 is 	 	past	year	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	have	some	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
 theoretic 	 ally 	 	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	in	order	to	express	 th 	 is 	 	gene	,	in	a	violent	way	,	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	,	before	puberty	,	you	have	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 trauma 	 tic 	 	--	not	a	little	stress	,	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 span 	 ked 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	violence	,	or	 be 	 ing 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	it	,	in	3d	.
right	?	that	's	how	the	mirror	 neuro 	 n 	 	system	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	if	you	have	that	gene	,	and	you	see	a	lot	of	violence	in	a	certain	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	recipe	for	disaster	,	absolute	disaster	.
and	what	i	think	might	happen	in	these	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	where	we	have	constant	violence	,	you	end	up	 hav 	 ing 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	of	 kid 	 s 	 	that	are	 see 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	violence	.
and	if	i	was	a	young	girl	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	a	violent	area	,	you	know	,	a	14	year	old	,	and	i	want	to	find	a	mate	,	i	'd	find	some	tough	guy	,	right	,	to	protect	me	.
well	what	the	problem	is	 th 	 is 	 	 tend 	 s 	 	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	these	 gene 	 s 	 	.
and	now	the	 boy 	 s 	 	and	the	 girl 	 s 	 	get	them	.
so	i	think	after	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	,	and	here	is	the	idea	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	 tin 	 der 	 box 	 	.
so	that	was	the	idea	.
but	then	my	mother	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	i	hear	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	going	around	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 psychopath 	 ic 	 	 killer 	 s 	 	.
and	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	come	from	a	normal	family	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	the	hell	are	you	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?	``
she	then	told	me	about	our	own	family	tree	.
now	she	 blame 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	my	father	's	side	,	of	course	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	these	 case 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 ha 	 s 	 	no	violence	in	her	 back 	 ground 	 	,	but	my	father	did	.
well	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	is	good	news	and	bad	news	.
one	of	your	 cousin 	 s 	 	is	ezra	cornell	,	founder	of	cornell	university	.
but	the	bad	news	is	that	your	cousin	is	 al 	 so 	 	lizzie	borden	.
now	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	what	?	we	have	lizzie	.	``
she	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	no	it	 get 	 s 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	read	 th 	 is 	 	book	.	``
and	here	is	 th 	 is 	 	``	 kill 	 ed 	 	 strange 	 ly 	 	,	``	and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 historic 	 al 	 	book	.
and	the	first	murder	of	a	mother	by	a	son	was	my	great	-	great	-	great	-	great	-	great	-	great	-	 grand 	 father 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	that	's	the	first	case	of	 matric 	 ide 	 	.
and	that	book	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	about	witch	 trial 	 s 	 	,	and	how	people	thought	back	then	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	stop	there	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	seven	more	men	,	on	my	father	's	side	,	 start 	 ing 	 	then	,	cornells	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	all	 murder 	 ers 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	one	a	little	pause	.
 be 	 cause 	 	my	father	 him 	 self 	 	,	and	my	three	 uncle 	 s 	 	,	in	world	war	ii	,	 we 	 re 	 	all	conscientious	 object 	 ors 	 	,	all	 pussy 	 cat 	 s 	 	.
but	every	once	in	a	while	,	like	lizzie	borden	,	like	three	 time 	 s 	 	a	century	,	and	we	're	kind	of	due	.
so	the	moral	of	the	story	is	:	people	in	glass	 house 	 s 	 	should	n't	throw	 stone 	 s 	 	.
but	more	 like 	 ly 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	we	had	to	take	action	.	now	our	 kid 	 s 	 	found	out	about	it	.
and	they	all	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	ok	.
but	our	 grand 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	kind	of	 concern 	 ed 	 	here	.
so	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	i	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	pet	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	of	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	family	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	pet	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	,	eegs	and	genetic	analysis	to	see	where	the	bad	news	is	.
now	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	--	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	one	son	and	one	daughter	,	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	,	did	n't	get	 a 	 long 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	are	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
they	have	the	same	brain	,	and	the	same	eeg	.
and	now	they	are	close	 a 	 s 	 	can	be	.
but	there	's	gon	na	be	bad	news	 some 	 where 	 	.
and	we	do	n't	know	where	it	's	going	to	pop	up	.
so	that	's	my	talk	.
