i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	start	a	revolution	.
now	before	you	get	up	in	 arm 	 s 	 	,	or	you	break	 in 	 to 	 	song	,	or	you	pick	a	 favor 	 ite 	 	color	,	i	want	to	define	what	i	mean	by	revolution	.
by	revolution	,	i	mean	a	drastic	and	far	-	 reach 	 ing 	 	change	in	the	way	we	think	and	 behav 	 e 	 	--	the	way	we	think	and	the	way	we	 behav 	 e 	 	.
now	why	,	steve	,	why	do	we	need	a	revolution	?
we	need	a	revolution	 be 	 cause 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	;	they	're	just	not	 work 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	sick	and	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	not	 work 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	i	'm	sick	and	 tire 	 d 	 	of	us	not	living	up	to	our	potential	.
i	'm	sick	and	 tire 	 d 	 	of	us	 be 	 ing 	 	last	.
and	we	are	last	place	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	social	 factor 	 s 	 	.
we	're	last	place	in	europe	in	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
there	we	are	right	at	the	end	,	right	at	the	bottom	,	last	place	 a 	 s 	 	a	culture	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	value	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
we	're	last	place	in	health	care	,	and	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	a	sense	of	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	there	we	are	,	not	just	last	in	the	e.u	.	,	we	're	last	in	europe	,	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	bottom	.
and	worst	of	all	,	it	just	came	out	three	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	it	,	the	economist	.
we	're	the	 s 	 add 	 est 	 	place	on	earth	,	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	gdp	per	capita	--	the	 s 	 add 	 est 	 	place	on	earth	.
that	's	social	.	let	's	look	at	education	.
where	do	we	rank	three	 week 	 s 	 	ago	in	 an 	 other 	 	report	by	the	oecd	?
last	in	 read 	 ing 	 	,	math	and	science	.	last	.
business	:	the	 low 	 est 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	in	the	e.u	.
that	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	provide	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
why	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
the	 low 	 est 	 	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	 business 	 es 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	small	business	is	the	engine	of	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	.
we	hire	the	most	people	;	we	create	the	most	 tax 	 es 	 	.
so	if	our	engine	's	broken	,	guess	what	?
last	in	europe	gdp	per	capita	.
last	.
so	it	's	no	surprise	,	 guy 	 s 	 	,	that	62	percent	of	bulgarians	are	not	 optimist 	 ic 	 	about	the	future	.
we	're	 un 	 happy 	 	,	we	have	bad	education	,	and	we	have	the	worst	 business 	 es 	 	.
and	these	are	 fact 	 s 	 	,	 guy 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	story	tale	;	it	's	not	make	-	 believ 	 e 	 	.
it	's	not	.
it	's	not	a	 conspi 	 racy 	 	i	have	got	against	bulgaria	.	these	are	 fact 	 s 	 	.
so	i	think	it	should	be	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	clear	that	our	system	is	broken	.
the	way	we	think	,	the	way	we	 behav 	 e 	 	,	our	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	of	 behav 	 ing 	 	is	broken	.
we	need	a	drastic	change	in	the	way	we	think	and	 behav 	 e 	 	to	transform	bulgaria	for	the	better	,	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	for	our	 friend 	 s 	 	,	for	our	family	and	for	our	future	.
how	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
let	's	be	positive	now	.	we	're	going	to	get	positive	.	how	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
i	think	we	're	last	 be 	 cause 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	drastic	to	some	of	you	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 handicap 	 ping 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	back	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	value	play	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	``	play	,	``	all	right	.
in	case	some	of	you	 for 	 got 	 	what	play	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	play	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 bab 	 ies 	 	play	,	 kid 	 s 	 	play	,	 adult 	 s 	 	play	.
we	do	n't	value	play	.
in	fact	,	we	 de 	 value 	 	play	.
and	we	 de 	 value 	 	it	in	three	 area 	 s 	 	.
let	's	go	back	to	the	same	three	 area 	 s 	 	.
social	:	45	 year 	 s 	 	of	what	?
of	 commun 	 ism 	 	--	of	 valu 	 ing 	 	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	the	state	over	the	individual	and	 squash 	 ing 	 	,	 in 	 advert 	 ent 	 ly 	 	,	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	individual	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	and	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	,	what	do	we	value	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 show 	 n 	 	the	way	we	 app 	 ly 	 	,	generate	and	use	knowledge	is	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	our	social	and	 institution 	 al 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	which	told	us	what	in	 commun 	 ism 	 	?
to	be	serious	.
to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	.
it	did	.
be	serious	.
i	ca	n't	tell	you	how	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 cold 	 ed 	 	in	the	park	for	 lett 	 ing 	 	my	 kid 	 s 	 	play	on	the	ground	.
heaven	forbid	they	play	in	the	dirt	,	the	 k 	 al 	 	,	or	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	lokvi	,	water	--	that	will	kill	them	.
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	told	by	 baba 	 s 	 	and	 dy 	 ado 	 s 	 	that	we	should	n't	let	our	 kid 	 s 	 	play	so	much	 be 	 cause 	 	life	is	serious	and	we	need	to	train	them	for	the	 serious 	 ness 	 	of	life	.
we	have	a	serious	meme	running	through	.
it	's	a	social	gene	running	through	us	.
it	's	a	serious	gene	.
it	's	45	 year 	 s 	 	of	it	that	's	 create 	 d 	 	what	i	call	the	``	baba	factor	.	``
and	here	's	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
step	one	:	woman	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	want	to	have	a	baby	.	iskam	baby	.	``
step	two	:	we	get	the	baby	.	woohoo	!
but	then	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	step	three	?
i	want	to	go	back	to	work	 be 	 cause 	 	i	need	to	further	my	 care 	 er 	 	or	i	just	want	to	go	have	 coffee 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	give	bebko	to	baba	.
but	we	need	to	remember	that	baba	's	 be 	 en 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	by	the	serious	meme	for	45	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
she	 pass 	 es 	 	that	virus	on	to	baby	,	and	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	long	time	--	 a 	 s 	 	the	 red 	 wood 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	--	for	that	serious	meme	to	get	out	of	our	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	then	?
it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	education	where	we	have	an	 anti 	 qu 	 ated 	 	education	system	that	 ha 	 s 	 	little	 change 	 d 	 	for	100	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	 value 	 s 	 	 rot 	 e 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	 memor 	 ization 	 	and	 standard 	 ization 	 	,	and	 de 	 value 	 s 	 	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	,	self	-	exploration	,	 question 	 ing 	 	,	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	play	.
it	's	a	crap	system	.
true	story	:	i	went	looking	for	a	school	for	my	kid	.
we	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	 pre 	 stig 	 ious 	 	little	school	and	they	say	they	're	going	to	 stud 	 y 	 	math	10	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	and	science	eight	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	and	 read 	 ing 	 	five	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	what	about	play	and	recess	?	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ha	.	there	wo	n't	be	a	single	moment	in	the	schedule	.	``
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	he	's	five	.	``
what	a	crime	.	what	a	crime	.
and	it	's	a	crime	that	our	education	system	is	so	serious	 be 	 cause 	 	education	is	serious	that	we	're	creating	 mind 	 less 	 	,	robotic	 work 	 ers 	 	to	put	 bolt 	 s 	 	in	pre	-	 drill 	 ed 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	sorry	,	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	are	not	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	the	industrial	revolution	.
we	need	 adapt 	 ability 	 	,	the	ability	to	learn	how	to	be	creative	and	 innov 	 ative 	 	.
we	do	n't	need	 mechan 	 ized 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	.
but	no	,	now	our	meme	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	work	where	we	do	n't	value	play	.
we	create	robotic	 work 	 ers 	 	that	we	treat	like	 asset 	 s 	 	,	to	lever	and	just	throw	away	.
what	are	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	a	bulgarian	work	?
 auto 	 cratic 	 	--	do	what	i	say	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	the	chef	.
i	'm	the	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	and	i	know	better	than	you	.
 un 	 trust 	 ing 	 	--	you	're	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	criminal	,	so	i	'm	going	to	install	 camera 	 s 	 	.

so	they	're	 restrict 	 ive 	 	--	do	n't	use	your	mobile	phone	,	do	n't	use	your	 lap 	 top 	 	,	do	n't	search	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	do	n't	be	on	i.m	.
that	's	 some 	 how 	 	 un 	 professional 	 	and	bad	.
and	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	it	's	 un 	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	controlled	,	you	're	 restrict 	 ed 	 	,	you	're	not	 valu 	 ed 	 	and	you	're	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	any	 f 	 un 	 	.
in	social	,	in	education	and	in	our	business	,	do	n't	value	play	.
and	that	's	why	we	're	last	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	value	play	.
and	you	can	say	,	``	that	's	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	steve	.	what	a	dumb	idea	.
it	ca	n't	be	 be 	 cause 	 	of	play	.
just	play	,	that	's	a	stupid	thing	.	``
we	have	the	serious	meme	in	us	.
well	i	'm	going	to	say	no	.
and	i	will	prove	it	to	you	in	the	next	part	of	the	speech	--	that	play	is	the	catalyst	,	it	is	the	revolution	,	that	we	can	use	to	transform	bulgaria	for	the	better	.
play	:	our	 brain 	 s 	 	are	 hard 	 wired 	 	for	play	.
evolution	 ha 	 s 	 	 select 	 ed 	 	,	over	 million 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	for	play	in	 animal 	 s 	 	and	in	 human 	 s 	 	.

we	're	designed	to	do	that	 continu 	 ously 	 	--	to	play	and	play	a	lot	and	not	stop	 play 	 ing 	 	.
it	is	a	huge	benefit	.
just	like	there	's	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	 animal 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	 human 	 s 	 	.

we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	that	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	play	is	work	.
we	even	feel	 guilt 	 y 	 	if	we	're	 s 	 een 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	at	work	.
``	oh	,	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	see	me	 laugh 	 ing 	 	.	i	must	not	have	 en 	 ough 	 	work	,	``	or	,	``	oh	,	i	've	got	to	hide	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	might	see	me	.
he	's	going	to	think	i	'm	not	 work 	 ing 	 	hard	.	``
but	i	have	news	for	you	:	our	 think 	 ing 	 	is	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	play	is	not	work	.
the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	play	is	 depress 	 ion 	 	.	it	's	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
in	fact	,	play	 improve 	 s 	 	our	work	.
just	like	there	's	 benefit 	 s 	 	for	 human 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 benefit 	 s 	 	for	play	at	work	.

so	before	you	start	 think 	 ing 	 	of	play	 a 	 s 	 	just	not	serious	,	play	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	frivolous	.
you	know	,	the	professional	athlete	that	 love 	 s 	 	 ski 	 ing 	 	,	he	's	serious	about	it	,	but	he	 love 	 s 	 	it	.

a	doctor	might	be	serious	,	but	laughter	's	still	a	great	medicine	.
our	 think 	 ing 	 	is	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
we	should	n't	be	 feel 	 ing 	 	 guilt 	 y 	 	.

play	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 product 	 ivity 	 	,	not	 de 	 crease 	 s 	 	.
and	you	're	going	to	say	,	``	gee	,	that	can	work	for	fedex	out	there	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	but	it	ca	n't	work	in	bulgaria	.
no	way	.	we	're	different	.	``
it	 do 	 es 	 	work	in	bulgaria	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	.	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
one	,	play	is	universal	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	weird	about	bulgarians	that	we	ca	n't	play	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	the	serious	meme	that	we	have	to	kick	out	.
two	,	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	.	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	at	sciant	.
when	i	got	there	,	we	had	zero	happy	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
not	one	 custom 	 er 	 	would	refer	us	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	all	.
we	had	marginal	profit	--	i	did	.
we	had	marginal	 profit 	 s 	 	,	and	we	had	 un 	 happy 	 	 s 	 take 	 holder 	 s 	 	.
through	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	change	,	change	like	 improv 	 ing 	 	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	change	like	promoting	self	-	direction	and	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 encourag 	 ing 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	not	 auto 	 cracy 	 	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 result 	 s 	 	-	focus	.
i	do	n't	care	when	you	get	in	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.	i	do	n't	care	when	you	 leav 	 e 	 	.
i	care	that	your	 custom 	 er 	 	and	your	team	is	happy	and	you	're	 organize 	 d 	 	with	that	.
why	do	i	care	if	you	get	in	at	nine	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	?
 bas 	 ically 	 	promoting	 f 	 un 	 	.
through	promoting	 f 	 un 	 	and	a	great	environment	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	transform	sciant	and	,	in	just	three	short	 year 	 s 	 	--	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	long	time	,	but	change	is	 s 	 low 	 	--	every	 custom 	 er 	 	,	from	zero	to	every	 custom 	 er 	 	 refer 	 ring 	 	us	,	above	average	 profit 	 s 	 	for	the	industry	and	happy	 s 	 take 	 holder 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	say	,	``	well	how	do	you	know	they	're	happy	?	``
well	we	did	win	,	every	year	that	we	 enter 	 ed 	 	,	one	of	the	 rank 	 ing 	 s 	 	for	best	 employ 	 er 	 	for	small	business	.
 in 	 dependent 	 	analysis	from	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 survey 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	,	and	it	can	,	work	in	bulgaria	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	us	back	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	our	own	 ment 	 ality 	 	about	play	.
so	some	 step 	 s 	 	that	we	can	take	--	to	finish	up	--	how	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	revolution	through	play	.
first	of	all	,	you	have	to	 believ 	 e 	 	me	.
if	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	well	just	go	home	and	think	about	it	some	more	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
second	of	all	,	if	you	do	n't	have	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	play	in	you	,	you	need	to	 re 	 discover 	 	play	.
 what 	 ever 	 	it	was	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	you	used	to	enjoy	,	that	you	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	but	now	that	you	've	got	that	 pro 	 motion 	 	you	ca	n't	enjoy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	feel	like	you	have	to	be	serious	,	 re 	 discover 	 	it	.
i	do	n't	care	if	it	's	mountain	 bi 	 king 	 	or	 read 	 ing 	 	a	book	or	 play 	 ing 	 	a	game	.
 re 	 discover 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	the	 innov 	 ation 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	the	thought	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
you	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	have	to	go	back	to	the	 off 	 ice 	 	or	talk	to	your	 friend 	 s 	 	and	ignite	the	fire	of	change	in	the	play	revolution	.
you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	to	,	and	if	you	're	not	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	,	your	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	your	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	are	n't	going	to	feel	it	.
you	've	got	to	go	back	and	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	trust	you	.	``
weird	 con 	 cept 	 	:	i	 hire 	 d 	 	you	;	i	should	trust	you	.
i	'm	going	to	let	you	make	 decision 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	going	to	empower	you	,	and	i	'm	going	to	 deleg 	 ate 	 	to	the	 low 	 est 	 	level	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	top	.
i	'm	going	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	 construct 	 ive 	 	 critic 	 ism 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	let	you	 challeng 	 e 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	by	 challeng 	 ing 	 	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	is	that	we	are	able	to	break	out	of	the	rut	that	we	're	in	and	create	 innov 	 ative 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	to	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	're	not	 al 	 ways 	 	right	 a 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
we	're	going	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	fear	.
fear	is	the	 ene 	 my 	 	of	play	.
and	we	're	going	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	eliminate	 restrict 	 ions 	 	.
you	know	what	,	let	them	use	 the 	 ir 	 	mobile	phone	for	personal	 call 	 s 	 	--	heaven	forbid	.
let	them	be	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
let	them	be	on	instant	 messenger 	 s 	 	.
let	them	take	long	 lunch 	 es 	 	.
lunch	is	like	the	recess	for	work	.
it	's	when	you	go	out	in	the	world	and	you	 re 	 charge 	 	your	brain	,	you	meet	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	you	have	a	beer	,	you	have	some	food	,	you	talk	,	you	get	some	 syn 	 er 	 gy 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	you	would	n't	have	had	before	.
let	them	do	it	.	give	them	some	 free 	 dom 	 	,	and	in	general	,	let	them	play	.	let	them	have	 f 	 un 	 	at	the	 work 	 place 	 	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	so	much	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	at	the	 work 	 place 	 	,	and	it	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	,	what	,	a	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	grind	,	so	that	20	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	we	wake	up	and	say	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	it	?
is	that	all	there	was	?	``
 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	.	nepriemliv	.
so	in	 summ 	 ary 	 	,	we	need	a	drastic	change	in	the	way	we	think	and	 behav 	 e 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	need	a	 work 	 ers 	 	'	revolution	.
we	do	n't	need	a	 work 	 ers 	 	'	revolution	.
what	we	need	is	a	 player 	 s 	 	'	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
what	we	need	is	a	 player 	 s 	 	'	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
what	we	need	is	a	 player 	 s 	 	'	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
 serious 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	to	band	together	.
 to 	 day 	 	is	the	start	of	the	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
but	what	you	need	to	do	is	fan	the	 flame 	 s 	 	of	the	revolution	.
you	need	to	go	and	share	your	 idea 	 s 	 	and	your	success	 st 	 ories 	 	of	what	 work 	 ed 	 	about	 re 	 invigo 	 rating 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	our	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	our	work	with	play	;	about	how	play	 promote 	 s 	 	a	sense	of	promise	and	self	-	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	;	of	how	play	 promote 	 s 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	 product 	 ivity 	 	,	and	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	how	play	 create 	 s 	 	meaning	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	ca	n't	do	it	 al 	 one 	 	.	we	have	to	do	it	together	,	and	together	,	if	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	and	share	these	 idea 	 s 	 	on	play	,	we	can	transform	bulgaria	for	the	better	.
thank	you	.
