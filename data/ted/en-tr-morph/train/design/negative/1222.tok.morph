my	name	is	kate	hartman	.
and	i	like	to	make	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	play	with	the	ways	that	we	 re 	 late 	 	and	communicate	.
so	i	'm	 specific 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 late 	 	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	each	other	and	the	world	around	us	.
so	just	to	give	you	a	bit	of	 con 	 text 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	june	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	'm	an	artist	,	a	 techno 	 logist 	 	and	an	 educ 	 ator 	 	.
i	teach	 course 	 s 	 	in	physical	computing	and	 wear 	 able 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
and	much	of	what	i	do	is	either	 wear 	 able 	 	or	 some 	 how 	 	related	to	the	human	form	.
and	so	 any 	 time 	 	i	talk	about	what	i	do	,	i	like	to	just	 quick 	 ly 	 	address	the	reason	why	bodies	matter	.
and	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	.
 every 	 body 	 	's	got	one	--	all	of	you	.
i	can	guarantee	,	 every 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	all	of	you	over	there	,	the	people	in	the	 cus 	 hy 	 	 seat 	 s 	 	,	the	people	up	top	with	the	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	--	we	all	have	bodies	.
do	n't	be	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	have	in	common	and	they	act	 a 	 s 	 	our	 prim 	 ary 	 	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	for	the	world	.
and	so	when	 work 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 interact 	 ion 	 	 design 	 er 	 	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	an	artist	who	 deal 	 s 	 	with	 particip 	 ation 	 	--	creating	 thing 	 s 	 	that	live	on	,	in	or	around	the	human	form	--	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	space	to	work	 with 	 in 	 	.
so	 with 	 in 	 	my	own	work	,	i	use	a	broad	range	of	 material 	 s 	 	and	 tool 	 s 	 	.
so	i	communicate	through	 every 	 thing 	 	from	radio	 transceiver 	 s 	 	to	 funnel 	 s 	 	and	plastic	 tub 	 ing 	 	.
and	to	tell	you	a	bit	about	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	make	,	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	place	to	start	the	story	is	with	a	hat	.
and	so	it	all	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	late	one	night	when	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	 sub 	 way 	 	,	 rid 	 ing 	 	home	,	and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	tend	to	be	a	person	who	 think 	 s 	 	too	much	and	 talk 	 s 	 	too	little	.
and	so	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	it	might	be	great	if	i	could	just	take	all	these	 noise 	 s 	 	--	like	all	these	 sound 	 s 	 	of	my	 thought 	 s 	 	in	my	head	--	if	i	could	just	 physical 	 ly 	 	 extr 	 ic 	 ate 	 	them	and	pull	them	out	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	form	that	i	could	share	them	with	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
and	so	i	went	home	,	and	i	made	a	prototype	of	 th 	 is 	 	hat	.
and	i	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	 mut 	 tering 	 	hat	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 emit 	 ted 	 	these	 mut 	 tering 	 	 noise 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 tether 	 ed 	 	to	you	,	but	you	could	detach	them	and	share	them	with	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
so	i	make	other	 hat 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	talk	to	 your 	 self 	 	hat	.
it	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	self	-	 explan 	 atory 	 	.
it	 physical 	 ly 	 	 carve 	 s 	 	out	conversation	space	for	one	.
and	when	you	speak	out	loud	,	the	sound	of	your	voice	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 channel 	 ed 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	your	own	 ear 	 s 	 	.
and	so	when	i	make	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	so	much	about	the	object	 it 	 self 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	the	negative	space	around	the	object	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	a	person	 put 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	on	?
what	kind	of	an	experience	do	they	have	?
and	how	are	they	 transform 	 ed 	 	by	 wear 	 ing 	 	it	?
so	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	focus	on	the	ways	in	which	we	 re 	 late 	 	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	gut	 listen 	 er 	 	.
and	it	is	a	tool	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	one	to	listen	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	innards	.
and	so	some	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 gear 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	and	communication	.
and	so	the	 infla 	 table 	 	heart	is	an	external	organ	that	can	be	used	by	the	 wear 	 er 	 	to	express	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 infla 	 te 	 	it	and	 defl 	 ate 	 	it	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
so	they	can	express	 every 	 thing 	 	from	 admi 	 ration 	 	and	lust	to	 anxie 	 ty 	 	and	 ang 	 st 	 	.
and	some	of	these	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	to	mediate	 experience 	 s 	 	.
so	the	discommunicator	is	a	tool	for	 argument 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	 allow 	 s 	 	for	an	 intens 	 e 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	,	but	is	 serve 	 s 	 	to	absorb	the	 specific 	 ity 	 	of	the	 word 	 s 	 	that	are	 deliver 	 ed 	 	.
and	in	the	end	,	some	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	just	act	 a 	 s 	 	 invit 	 ations 	 	.
so	the	ear	bender	 liter 	 ally 	 	 put 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	out	there	so	 some 	 one 	 	can	grab	your	ear	and	say	what	they	have	to	say	.
so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	relationship	between	people	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	consider	the	ways	in	which	we	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	world	around	us	.
and	so	when	i	was	first	living	in	new	york	city	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	back	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	a	lot	about	the	familiar	 architect 	 ural 	 	 form 	 s 	 	that	 surround 	 ed 	 	me	and	how	i	would	like	to	better	 re 	 late 	 	to	them	.
and	i	thought	,	``	well	,	 he 	 y 	 	!
 may 	 be 	 	if	i	want	to	better	 re 	 late 	 	to	 wall 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	need	to	be	more	wall	-	like	 my 	 self 	 	.	``
so	i	made	a	 wear 	 able 	 	wall	that	i	could	wear	 a 	 s 	 	a	 back 	 pack 	 	.
and	so	i	would	put	it	on	and	sort	of	 physical 	 ly 	 	transform	 my 	 self 	 	so	that	i	could	either	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	or	critique	the	 space 	 s 	 	that	 surround 	 ed 	 	me	.
and	so	 jump 	 ing 	 	off	of	that	,	 think 	 ing 	 	beyond	the	built	environment	 in 	 to 	 	the	natural	world	,	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	 on 	 going 	 	project	 call 	 ed 	 	botanicalls	--	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	 house 	 plant 	 s 	 	to	tap	 in 	 to 	 	human	communication	 proto 	 col 	 s 	 	.
so	when	a	plant	is	 thirst 	 y 	 	,	it	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	a	phone	call	or	post	a	 mess 	 age 	 	to	a	service	like	twitter	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 shift 	 s 	 	the	human	/	plant	dynamic	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	single	house	plant	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	express	 it 	 s 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	at	the	same	time	.
and	so	kind	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	scale	,	my	most	 re 	 cent 	 	obsession	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	with	 glaci 	 ers 	 	--	of	course	.
and	so	 glaci 	 ers 	 	are	these	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	to	be	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	them	,	but	what	i	'm	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	in	human	-	 glaci 	 er 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	an	issue	.
the	 glaci 	 ers 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	us	.
they	're	both	 shrink 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 treat 	 ing 	 	--	and	some	of	them	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	 al 	 together 	 	.
and	so	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	live	in	canada	now	,	so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 visit 	 ing 	 	one	of	my	local	 glaci 	 ers 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	all	the	 glaci 	 ers 	 	in	north	america	,	it	 receiv 	 es 	 	the	highest	volume	of	human	traffic	in	a	year	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	these	 bus 	 es 	 	that	drive	up	and	over	the	lateral	 mor 	 a 	 ine 	 	and	drop	people	off	on	the	surface	of	the	 glaci 	 er 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	gotten	me	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	experience	of	the	 initi 	 al 	 	 en 	 counter 	 	.
when	i	meet	a	 glaci 	 er 	 	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	,	what	do	i	do	?
there	's	no	kind	of	social	 proto 	 col 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	just	do	n't	even	know	how	to	say	 hell 	 o 	 	.
do	i	carve	a	 mess 	 age 	 	in	the	snow	?
or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	i	can	assemble	one	out	of	dot	and	dash	ice	 cube 	 s 	 	--	ice	cube	morse	code	.
or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	i	need	to	make	 my 	 self 	 	a	 s 	 peaking 	 	tool	,	like	an	 ic 	 y 	 	 mega 	 phone 	 	that	i	can	use	to	 ampl 	 ify 	 	my	voice	when	i	direct	it	at	the	ice	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	the	most	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	experience	i	've	had	is	the	act	of	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	what	we	need	in	any	good	relationship	.
and	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	by	how	much	it	 affect 	 ed 	 	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	shift	in	my	physical	 orient 	 ation 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	me	shift	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	in	relation	to	the	 glaci 	 er 	 	.
and	so	since	we	use	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	world	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	a	 de 	 vice 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 glaci 	 er 	 	 em 	 bracing 	 	suit	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 construct 	 ed 	 	out	of	a	heat	 reflect 	 ed 	 	material	that	 serve 	 s 	 	to	mediate	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	temperature	between	the	human	body	and	the	 glaci 	 al 	 	ice	.
and	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 invit 	 ation 	 	that	 ask 	 s 	 	people	to	lay	down	on	the	 glaci 	 er 	 	and	give	it	a	hug	.
so	,	yea	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
these	are	 initi 	 al 	 	 mus 	 ing 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
and	just	 a 	 s 	 	with	the	wall	,	how	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	more	wall	-	like	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	i	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	to	take	more	a	of	 glaci 	 al 	 	pace	.
and	so	my	intent	is	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	take	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	and	go	on	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 project 	 s 	 	where	i	work	with	people	from	different	 discipline 	 s 	 	--	 artist 	 s 	 	,	 techno 	 logists 	 	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	--	to	kind	of	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	project	of	how	we	can	improve	human	-	 glaci 	 er 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	.
so	beyond	that	,	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	i	'd	just	like	to	say	that	we	're	in	 th 	 is 	 	era	of	 communication 	 s 	 	and	 de 	 vice 	 	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	tremendous	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	and	sexy	,	but	i	think	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	we	can	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	maintain	a	sense	of	wonder	and	a	sense	of	 critical 	 ity 	 	about	the	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	use	and	the	ways	in	which	we	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	world	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
