good	 morn 	 ing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	.
i	work	with	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	little	,	itty	-	bitty	 creature 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	let	me	tell	you	what	it	's	like	to	grow	these	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	.
i	work	in	a	lab	where	we	take	 cell 	 s 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	native	environment	.
we	plate	them	 in 	 to 	 	 dish 	 es 	 	that	we	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	call	 pe 	 tri 	 	 dish 	 es 	 	.
and	we	feed	them	--	 steril 	 e 	 ly 	 	of	course	--	with	what	we	call	cell	culture	media	--	which	is	like	 the 	 ir 	 	food	--	and	we	grow	them	in	 incub 	 ators 	 	.
why	do	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
we	 observ 	 e 	 	the	 cell 	 s 	 	in	a	plate	,	and	they	're	just	on	the	surface	.
but	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	in	my	lab	is	to	engineer	 tissue 	 s 	 	out	of	them	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	even	mean	?
well	it	 mean 	 s 	 	growing	an	actual	heart	,	let	's	say	,	or	grow	a	piece	of	bone	that	can	be	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	body	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	they	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	used	for	disease	 model 	 s 	 	.
and	for	 th 	 is 	 	purpose	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	cell	culture	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	just	 re 	 ally 	 	are	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	.
the	 cell 	 s 	 	are	kind	of	 home 	 sick 	 	;	the	dish	 do 	 es 	 	n't	feel	like	 the 	 ir 	 	home	.
and	so	we	need	to	do	better	at	 copy 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	environment	to	get	them	to	 thriv 	 e 	 	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	the	biomimetic	paradigm	--	 copy 	 ing 	 	nature	in	the	lab	.
let	's	take	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	heart	,	the	 top 	 ic 	 	of	a	lot	of	my	research	.
what	 make 	 s 	 	the	heart	 un 	 ique 	 	?
well	,	the	heart	 beat 	 s 	 	,	 rhythm 	 ically 	 	,	 tire 	 lessly 	 	,	 faith 	 fully 	 	.
we	copy	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	lab	by	 out 	 fitting 	 	cell	culture	 system 	 s 	 	with	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	.
these	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	act	like	mini	 pace 	 makers 	 	to	get	the	 cell 	 s 	 	to	contract	in	the	lab	.
what	else	do	we	know	about	the	heart	?
well	,	heart	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	 greed 	 y 	 	.
nature	 feed 	 s 	 	the	heart	 cell 	 s 	 	in	your	body	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	dense	blood	supply	.
in	the	lab	,	we	micro	-	pattern	 channel 	 s 	 	in	the	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	on	which	we	grow	the	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	flow	the	cell	culture	media	,	the	 cell 	 s 	 	'	food	,	through	the	 scaffold 	 s 	 	where	we	're	growing	the	 cell 	 s 	 	--	a	lot	like	what	you	might	expect	from	a	 cap 	 ill 	 ary 	 	bed	in	the	heart	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	 less 	 on 	 	number	one	:	life	can	do	a	lot	with	 ver 	 y 	 	little	.
let	's	take	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 electric 	 al 	 	 stimul 	 ation 	 	.
let	's	see	how	 power 	 ful 	 	just	one	of	these	 essential 	 s 	 	can	be	.
on	the	left	,	we	see	a	 tin 	 y 	 	piece	of	 beat 	 ing 	 	heart	tissue	that	i	engineered	from	rat	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	.
it	's	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	mini	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	.
and	after	one	week	,	it	's	 beat 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	see	it	in	the	upper	left	-	hand	corner	.
but	do	n't	worry	if	you	ca	n't	see	it	so	well	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	that	these	 cell 	 s 	 	beat	at	all	.
but	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	 cell 	 s 	 	,	when	we	 electric 	 ally 	 	 stimul 	 ate 	 	them	,	like	with	a	 pace 	 maker 	 	,	that	they	beat	so	much	more	.
but	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	 less 	 on 	 	number	two	:	 cell 	 s 	 	do	all	the	work	.
in	a	sense	,	tissue	 engineer 	 s 	 	have	a	bit	of	an	 ident 	 ity 	 	crisis	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	structural	 engineer 	 s 	 	build	 bridge 	 s 	 	and	big	 thing 	 s 	 	,	computer	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 computer 	 s 	 	,	but	what	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	building	 enabl 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	the	 cell 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	for	us	?
let	's	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	.
let	's	 re 	 mind 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	 cell 	 s 	 	are	not	an	abstract	 con 	 cept 	 	.
let	's	remember	that	our	 cell 	 s 	 	sustain	our	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	real	way	.
``	we	are	what	we	eat	,	``	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	we	are	what	our	 cell 	 s 	 	eat	.	``
and	in	the	case	of	the	 flor 	 a 	 	in	our	gut	,	these	 cell 	 s 	 	may	not	even	be	human	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	worth	 not 	 ing 	 	that	 cell 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	mediate	our	experience	of	life	.
 be 	 hind 	 	every	sound	,	sight	,	touch	,	taste	and	smell	is	a	 correspond 	 ing 	 	set	of	 cell 	 s 	 	that	 receiv 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	and	interpret	it	for	us	.
it	 beg 	 s 	 	the	question	:	 s 	 hall 	 	we	expand	our	sense	of	 environment 	 al 	 	 steward 	 ship 	 	to	include	the	 eco 	 system 	 	of	our	own	bodies	?
i	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	with	me	further	,	and	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	i	wish	you	luck	.
may	 non 	 e 	 	of	your	non	-	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	.
thank	you	.
