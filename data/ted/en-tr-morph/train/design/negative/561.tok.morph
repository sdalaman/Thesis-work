now	i	am	going	to	speak	to	you	about	my	movie	.
for	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 shoot 	 ing 	 	the	earth	for	the	movie	.
the	name	of	the	movie	is	``	home	``	--	``	maison	.	``
it	is	about	the	state	of	the	planet	.
it	's	a	fantastic	story	of	life	on	the	earth	.
i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	to	show	you	the	 teas 	 er 	 	.
video	:	 th 	 is 	 	earth	is	four	and	a	half	billion	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
these	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	million	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	we	 human 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 up 	 right 	 	for	 on 	 ly 	 	200	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 manage 	 d 	 	to	adapt	,	and	have	 conquer 	 ed 	 	the	whole	planet	.
for	 generation 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	raising	our	children	,	not	 un 	 like 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	other	species	living	 be 	 side 	 	us	.
for	the	past	30	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	earth	and	 it 	 s 	 	dwellers	from	high	up	in	the	sky	.
our	life	is	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	the	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	our	planet	.
we	depend	on	water	,	 forest 	 s 	 	,	 desert 	 s 	 	,	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
 fish 	 ing 	 	,	 breed 	 ing 	 	,	 farm 	 ing 	 	are	still	the	world	's	 fore 	 most 	 	human	 occupation 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 bind 	 s 	 	us	together	is	far	 great 	 er 	 	than	what	 divide 	 s 	 	us	.
we	all	share	the	same	need	for	the	earth	's	 gift 	 s 	 	--	the	same	wish	to	rise	above	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	 be 	 come 	 	better	.
and	yet	we	carry	on	raising	 wall 	 s 	 	to	keep	us	 a 	 part 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	our	 great 	 est 	 	battle	is	to	protect	the	natural	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	our	planet	.
in	less	than	50	 year 	 s 	 	we	've	 alter 	 ed 	 	it	more	 thorough 	 ly 	 	than	in	the	entire	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 man 	 kind 	 	.
half	of	the	world	's	 forest 	 s 	 	have	 vanish 	 ed 	 	.
water	 resource 	 s 	 	are	running	low	.
intensive	 farm 	 ing 	 	is	 deple 	 ting 	 	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	.
our	energy	 source 	 s 	 	are	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
the	climate	is	changing	.
we	are	 en 	 danger 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	improve	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	the	wealth	 gap 	 s 	 	are	growing	 wide 	 r 	 	.
we	have	n't	yet	 under 	 stood 	 	that	we	're	going	at	a	much	 fast 	 er 	 	pace	than	the	planet	can	sustain	.
we	know	that	 solution 	 s 	 	are	 avail 	 able 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	all	have	the	power	to	change	 th 	 is 	 	trend	for	the	better	.
so	what	are	we	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	?
yab	:	luc	besson	is	the	 produce 	 r 	 	of	the	movie	.
but	it	is	not	a	normal	movie	.
the	film	is	going	to	be	 distribut 	 ed 	 	free	.
 th 	 is 	 	film	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 copy 	 right 	 	.
on	the	five	of	june	,	the	environment	day	,	 every 	 body 	 	can	download	the	movie	on	 inter 	 net 	 	.
the	film	is	 give 	 n 	 	for	free	to	the	 distribut 	 or 	 	for	tv	and	theater	to	show	it	the	fifth	of	june	.
there	is	no	business	on	 th 	 is 	 	movie	.
it	is	 al 	 so 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	for	school	,	cities	,	ngos	and	you	.
we	have	to	 believ 	 e 	 	what	we	know	.
let	me	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.
it	's	too	late	to	be	 pessim 	 istic 	 	--	 re 	 ally 	 	too	late	.
we	have	all	a	part	of	the	 solution 	 s 	 	.
to	finish	,	i	would	like	to	welcome	the	4,700th	baby	born	since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
merci	 be 	 au 	 coup 	 	.	i	love	you	.
