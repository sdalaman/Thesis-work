well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	state	 budget 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 bor 	 ing 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	of	the	whole	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
but	i	want	to	tell	you	,	i	think	it	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	that	we	need	to	care	about	.
state	 budget 	 s 	 	are	big	,	big	money	--	i	'll	show	you	the	 number 	 s 	 	--	and	they	get	 ver 	 y 	 	little	 scru 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
the	 understand 	 ing 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	low	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	 involve 	 d 	 	have	special	 interest 	 s 	 	or	short	-	term	 interest 	 s 	 	that	get	them	not	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	the	 trend 	 s 	 	are	.
and	these	 budget 	 s 	 	are	the	key	for	our	future	;	they	're	the	key	for	our	 kid 	 s 	 	.
most	education	 fund 	 ing 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	k	through	12	,	or	the	great	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	or	community	 college 	 s 	 	--	most	of	the	money	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	coming	out	of	these	state	 budget 	 s 	 	.
but	we	have	a	problem	.
here	's	the	 over 	 all 	 	picture	.
u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	big	--	14.7	trillion	.
now	out	of	that	pie	,	the	government	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	36	percent	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	the	federal	level	,	which	is	the	largest	,	the	state	level	and	the	local	level	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	way	that	you	get	an	 over 	 all 	 	sense	of	what	's	going	on	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	like	medicaid	and	research	money	that	flow	 a 	 cross 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	.
but	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	36	percent	.
well	what	are	we	taking	in	?
simple	business	question	.
answer	is	26	percent	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	10	percent	 defici 	 t 	 	,	sort	of	a	mind	-	 blow 	 ing 	 	number	.
and	some	of	that	,	in	fact	,	is	due	to	the	fact	that	we	've	had	an	economic	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
 receipt 	 s 	 	go	down	,	some	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 program 	 s 	 	go	up	,	but	most	of	it	is	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	.
most	of	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	ways	that	the	 li 	 abilities 	 	are	building	up	and	the	 trend 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 create 	 s 	 	a	huge	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 fore 	 cast 	 	picture	.
there	are	 vari 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	here	:	i	could	say	we	might	raise	more	revenue	,	or	medical	 innov 	 ation 	 	will	make	the	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	even	 high 	 er 	 	.
it	is	an	 increasing 	 ly 	 	difficult	picture	,	even	 assum 	 ing 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	well	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	better	than	it	will	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	see	at	 th 	 is 	 	 over 	 all 	 	level	.
now	how	did	we	get	here	?
how	could	you	have	a	problem	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
after	all	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	on	paper	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	that	these	state	 budget 	 s 	 	are	 balanc 	 ed 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	one	state	 say 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	have	to	balance	the	budget	.
but	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	that	there	's	a	 pre 	 tense 	 	.
there	's	no	real	,	true	 balanc 	 ing 	 	going	on	,	and	in	a	sense	,	the	 game 	 s 	 	they	play	to	hide	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 obscur 	 e 	 	the	 top 	 ic 	 	so	much	that	people	do	n't	see	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	straight	-	forward	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
when	jerry	 brow 	 n 	 	was	 elect 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	was	put	to	him	.
that	is	,	through	 vari 	 ous 	 	 gimmick 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	,	a	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 balanc 	 ed 	 	budget	had	led	him	to	have	25	billion	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	out	of	the	76	billion	in	 pro 	 posed 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	.
now	he	's	put	together	some	 thought 	 s 	 	:	about	half	of	that	he	'll	cut	,	 an 	 other 	 	half	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	set	of	 step 	 s 	 	,	 tax 	 es 	 	will	be	approved	.
but	even	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	future	 year 	 s 	 	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	pension	 cost 	 s 	 	,	health	 cost 	 s 	 	go	up	 en 	 ough 	 	,	and	the	revenue	 do 	 es 	 	not	go	up	 en 	 ough 	 	.
so	you	get	a	big	 squeez 	 e 	 	.
what	 we 	 re 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	hide	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	some	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	little	 trick 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	 some 	 what 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	.
the	paper	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 balanc 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	got	 hole 	 s 	 	.
it	 perpetu 	 ates 	 	 defici 	 t 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 riddle 	 d 	 	with	 gimmick 	 s 	 	.	``
and	 re 	 ally 	 	when	you	get	down	to	it	,	the	 guy 	 s 	 	at	enron	never	would	have	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	so	blatant	,	so	 extrem 	 e 	 	.
is	 any 	 one 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	do	?
they	borrow	money	.
they	're	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	,	but	they	figure	out	a	way	.
they	make	you	pay	more	in	 with 	 hold 	 ing 	 	just	to	help	 the 	 ir 	 	cash	flow	out	.
they	sell	off	the	 asset 	 s 	 	.
they	 def 	 er 	 	the	 payment 	 s 	 	.
they	sell	off	the	 revenue 	 s 	 	from	tobacco	.
and	california	's	not	 un 	 ique 	 	.
in	fact	,	there	's	about	five	 state 	 s 	 	that	are	 wo 	 rse 	 	and	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	four	 state 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	face	 th 	 is 	 	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
so	it	's	 system 	 ic 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	country	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	fact	that	certain	long	-	term	 oblig 	 ations 	 	--	health	care	,	where	 innov 	 ation 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	more	expensive	,	early	 retire 	 ment 	 	and	pension	,	where	the	age	structure	 get 	 s 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	for	you	,	and	just	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	--	that	these	mis	-	 account 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	allow	to	develop	over	time	,	that	you	've	got	a	problem	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 retire 	 e 	 	health	care	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
three	million	set	 a 	 side 	 	,	62	billion	dollar	 li 	 ability 	 	--	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	the	car	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	that	and	 k 	 new 	 	that	that	was	headed	 to 	 ward 	 	a	huge	problem	.
the	 fore 	 cast 	 	for	the	medical	piece	 al 	 one 	 	is	to	go	from	26	percent	of	the	budget	to	42	percent	.
well	what	's	going	to	give	?
well	in	order	to	 accommo 	 date 	 	that	,	you	would	have	to	cut	education	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	in	half	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	young	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	old	to	some	degree	.
if	you	do	n't	change	that	revenue	picture	,	if	you	do	n't	solve	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	health	care	,	you	're	going	to	be	 de 	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	the	young	.
the	great	university	of	california	university	system	,	the	great	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	gone	on	,	wo	n't	happen	.
so	far	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	 lay 	 off 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	class	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	.
 with 	 in 	 	the	education	community	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	of	,	``	should	it	just	be	the	young	 teacher 	 s 	 	who	get	laid	off	,	or	the	less	good	 teacher 	 s 	 	who	get	laid	off	?	``
and	there	's	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	:	if	you	're	going	to	 in 	 crease 	 	class	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	,	where	do	you	do	that	?	how	much	effect	 do 	 es 	 	that	have	?
and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	that	,	people	get	 con 	 fused 	 	and	think	,	well	 may 	 be 	 	you	think	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
in	fact	,	no	,	education	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	should	not	be	cut	.
there	's	ways	,	if	it	's	 tempor 	 ary 	 	,	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	the	impact	,	but	it	's	a	problem	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	a	problem	for	where	we	need	to	go	.
technology	 ha 	 s 	 	a	role	to	play	.
well	we	need	money	to	experiment	with	that	,	to	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	in	there	.
there	's	the	idea	of	 pay 	 ing 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	for	 effective 	 ness 	 	,	 measur 	 ing 	 	them	,	giving	them	 feed 	 back 	 	,	taking	 video 	 s 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	i	think	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
well	you	have	to	 al 	 locate 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	that	system	and	for	that	incentive	pay	.
in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	you	have	growth	,	you	put	the	new	money	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
or	even	if	you	're	flat	,	you	might	shift	money	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
but	with	the	type	of	 cut 	 s 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	it	will	be	far	,	far	 hard 	 er 	 	to	get	these	 incentive 	 s 	 	for	excellence	,	or	to	move	over	to	use	technology	in	the	new	way	.
so	what	's	going	on	?
where	's	the	brain	trust	that	's	in	error	here	?
well	there	 re 	 ally 	 	is	no	brain	trust	.
it	's	sort	of	the	 vot 	 ers 	 	.	it	's	sort	of	us	 show 	 ing 	 	up	.
just	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	.
california	will	 s 	 pend 	 	over	100	billion	,	 micro 	 soft 	 	,	38	,	google	,	about	19	.
the	amount	of	iq	in	good	numeric	analysis	,	both	 in 	 side 	 	google	and	 micro 	 soft 	 	and	 out 	 side 	 	,	with	 analyst 	 s 	 	and	people	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	 opinion 	 s 	 	--	should	they	have	 s 	 pent 	 	on	that	?
no	,	they	 waste 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	money	on	 th 	 is 	 	.	what	about	 th 	 is 	 	thing	?	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	opinion	.
there	's	great	 feed 	 back 	 	.
and	the	 number 	 s 	 	are	used	to	make	 decision 	 s 	 	.
if	you	go	over	the	education	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	and	the	health	care	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	these	long	-	term	 trend 	 s 	 	--	you	do	n't	have	that	type	of	 involve 	 ment 	 	on	a	number	that	's	more	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	do	we	need	to	do	?
we	need	better	 tool 	 s 	 	.
we	can	get	some	 thing 	 s 	 	out	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	use	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	to	put	up	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	will	give	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	picture	.
we	need	 lot 	 s 	 	more	.
there	's	a	few	good	 book 	 s 	 	,	one	about	school	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	and	where	the	money	 come 	 s 	 	from	--	how	that	's	 change 	 d 	 	over	time	,	and	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
we	need	better	 account 	 ing 	 	.
we	need	to	take	the	fact	that	the	current	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	the	future	 li 	 abilities 	 	they	create	,	that	should	come	out	of	the	current	budget	.
we	need	to	understand	why	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	the	pension	 account 	 ing 	 	the	way	they	have	.
it	should	be	more	like	private	 account 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	the	gold	standard	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	to	 re 	 ally 	 	reward	 politic 	 ians 	 	.
 when 	 ever 	 	they	say	there	's	these	long	-	term	 problem 	 s 	 	,	we	ca	n't	say	,	``	oh	,	you	're	the	messenger	with	bad	news	?
we	just	shot	you	.	``
in	fact	,	there	are	some	like	these	:	erskine	bowles	,	alan	simpson	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	who	have	gone	through	and	 give 	 n 	 	 proposal 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 over 	 all 	 	federal	health	-	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	state	-	level	problem	.
but	in	fact	,	 the 	 ir 	 	work	was	sort	of	 push 	 ed 	 	off	.
in	fact	,	the	week	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	some	tax	 cut 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 d 	 one 	 	that	made	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 assumption 	 s 	 	.
so	we	need	these	 piece 	 s 	 	.
now	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 so 	 lv 	 able 	 	problem	.
it	's	a	great	country	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	.
but	we	have	to	draw	 t 	 hose 	 	people	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	education	.
and	just	look	at	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	the	 tu 	 ition 	 s 	 	with	the	university	of	california	and	project	that	out	for	 an 	 other 	 	three	,	four	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	--	it	's	 un 	 afford 	 able 	 	.
and	that	's	the	kind	of	thing	--	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	the	young	--	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	great	,	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	do	the	art	,	the	 bio 	 technology 	 	,	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	magic	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	bottom	line	is	we	need	to	care	about	state	 budget 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	critical	for	our	 kid 	 s 	 	and	our	future	.
thank	you	.
