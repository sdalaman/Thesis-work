college	 pre 	 sidents 	 	are	not	the	first	people	who	come	to	mind	when	the	subject	is	the	uses	of	the	creative	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
so	i	thought	i	'd	start	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	how	i	got	here	.
the	story	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	late	'90s	.
i	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	meet	with	 lead 	 ing 	 	 educ 	 ators 	 	from	the	 new 	 ly 	 	free	eastern	europe	and	russia	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	 re 	 build 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	.
since	education	under	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	 purpose 	 s 	 	of	a	state	 ideo 	 logy 	 	,	they	 appreciate 	 d 	 	that	it	would	take	 whole 	 sale 	 	 transform 	 ations 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	to	provide	an	education	worthy	of	free	men	and	women	.
 give 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	rare	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	start	fresh	,	they	chose	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 compel 	 ling 	 	model	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	historic	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	 further 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 student 	 s 	 	'	 broad 	 est 	 	intellectual	,	and	 deep 	 est 	 	 ethic 	 al 	 	potential	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	made	that	decision	they	came	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	home	of	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	education	,	to	talk	with	some	of	us	most	 close 	 ly 	 	identified	with	that	kind	of	education	.
they	spoke	with	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	an	 urge 	 ncy 	 	,	an	intellectual	 convict 	 ion 	 	that	,	for	me	,	was	a	voice	i	had	not	heard	in	 decade 	 s 	 	,	a	dream	long	 for 	 gotten 	 	.
for	,	in	truth	,	we	had	 move 	 d 	 	light	 year 	 s 	 	from	the	 pass 	 ions 	 	that	 animate 	 d 	 	them	.
but	for	me	,	 un 	 like 	 	them	,	in	my	world	,	the	 s 	 late 	 	was	not	clean	,	and	what	was	written	on	it	was	not	 encourag 	 ing 	 	.
in	truth	,	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	education	no	 long 	 er 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	genuine	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	education	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
we	have	 professional 	 ized 	 	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	to	the	point	where	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	provide	the	 bread 	 th 	 	of	application	and	the	 enhance 	 d 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	civic	 engage 	 ment 	 	that	is	 the 	 ir 	 	signature	.

the	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	's	college	student	is	to	jettison	every	interest	 ex 	 cept 	 	one	.

 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 version 	 	to	social	 value 	 s 	 	may	seem	at	 odd 	 s 	 	with	the	explosion	of	community	service	 program 	 s 	 	.

 know 	 ing 	 	that	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	regain	the	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	of	liberal	education	,	it	would	take	radical	 re 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	 assumption 	 s 	 	,	 begin 	 ning 	 	with	our	 prior 	 ities 	 	.

while	these	past	 week 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	time	of	national	 exhila 	 ration 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	it	would	be	tragic	if	you	thought	 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	your	job	was	 d 	 one 	 	.
the	 glaci 	 al 	 	silence	we	have	 experience 	 d 	 	in	the	face	of	the	 shred 	 d 	 ing 	 	of	the	 constit 	 ution 	 	,	the	 unravel 	 ing 	 	of	our	public	 institution 	 s 	 	,	the	 deterio 	 ration 	 	of	our	 infra 	 structure 	 	is	not	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	the	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	.
we	the	people	have	 be 	 come 	 	 in 	 ur 	 ed 	 	to	our	own	 ir 	 relevance 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	significant	about	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 matter 	 s 	 	 concern 	 ing 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	beyond	 wait 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	persist	 al 	 so 	 	in	 be 	 ing 	 	 side 	 lined 	 	by	the	idea	of	the	expert	 a 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 cap 	 able 	 	of	coming	up	with	 answer 	 s 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	evidence	to	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	.
the	problem	is	there	is	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	 vi 	 able 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	made	up	of	 expert 	 s 	 	,	 zeal 	 ot 	 s 	 	,	 politic 	 ians 	 	and	 spect 	 ators 	 	.
people	will	 continu 	 e 	 	and	should	 continu 	 e 	 	to	learn	 every 	 thing 	 	there	is	to	know	about	 some 	 thing 	 	or	other	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	it	all	the	time	.
and	there	will	be	and	should	be	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 s 	 pend 	 	a	 life 	 time 	 	 pur 	 suing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	defined	area	of	 inquir 	 y 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	single	-	mindedness	will	not	yield	the	 flex 	 ibilities 	 	of	mind	,	the	 multi 	 plicit 	 y 	 	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	the	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	for	 collabor 	 ation 	 	and	 innov 	 ation 	 	 th 	 is 	 	country	 need 	 s 	 	.
that	is	where	you	come	in	.
what	is	certain	is	that	the	individual	talent	 exhibit 	 ed 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	abundance	here	,	 need 	 s 	 	to	turn	 it 	 s 	 	attention	to	that	 collabor 	 ative 	 	,	 mess 	 y 	 	,	 frust 	 rating 	 	,	 content 	 ious 	 	and	 im 	 possible 	 	world	of	 politic 	 s 	 	and	public	policy	.
 p 	 resident 	 	obama	and	his	team	 simpl 	 y 	 	can	not	do	it	 al 	 one 	 	.
if	the	question	of	where	to	start	 seem 	 s 	 	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	you	are	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	not	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	adventure	.
 be 	 ing 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	is	the	first	step	if	you	are	serious	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	at	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	,	on	a	scale	that	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
so	what	do	you	do	when	you	feel	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	you	have	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	have	a	mind	.	and	you	have	other	people	.
start	with	 t 	 hose 	 	,	and	change	the	world	.
