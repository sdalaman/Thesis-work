what	you	just	heard	are	the	 interact 	 ions 	 	of	 baro 	 metric 	 	pressure	,	wind	and	temperature	 read 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	of	hurricane	noel	in	2007	.
the	 music 	 ians 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	off	a	three	-	dimensional	graph	of	weather	data	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
every	single	 be 	 ad 	 	,	every	single	 color 	 ed 	 	band	,	 represent 	 s 	 	a	weather	element	that	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	read	 a 	 s 	 	a	musical	note	.
i	find	weather	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
weather	is	an	 am 	 al 	 gam 	 	of	 system 	 s 	 	that	is	 inherent 	 ly 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	to	most	of	us	.
so	i	use	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	and	music	to	make	it	,	not	just	visible	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 tact 	 ile 	 	and	audible	.
all	of	my	work	 begin 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
i	 ex 	 tract 	 	information	from	a	specific	environment	using	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	tech	data	 collect 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	--	 general 	 ly 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	i	can	find	in	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	store	.
i	then	 compar 	 e 	 	my	information	to	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	find	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	--	satellite	 image 	 s 	 	,	weather	data	from	weather	 station 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 off 	 shore 	 	 buoy 	 s 	 	.
that	's	both	 historic 	 al 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	real	data	.
and	then	i	 compil 	 e 	 	all	of	these	 number 	 s 	 	on	these	 clip 	 board 	 s 	 	that	you	see	here	.
these	 clip 	 board 	 s 	 	are	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 number 	 s 	 	.
and	from	all	of	these	 number 	 s 	 	,	i	start	with	 on 	 ly 	 	two	or	three	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	.
that	 begin 	 s 	 	my	 transl 	 ation 	 	process	.
my	 transl 	 ation 	 	medium	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	basket	.
a	basket	is	made	up	of	 horizon 	 tal 	 	and	 vert 	 ical 	 	 element 	 s 	 	.
when	i	assign	 value 	 s 	 	to	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	and	 horizon 	 tal 	 	 element 	 s 	 	,	i	can	use	the	 change 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	data	 point 	 s 	 	over	time	to	create	the	form	.
i	use	natural	 re 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	natural	 re 	 ed 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	tension	in	it	that	i	can	not	fully	control	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	is	the	 number 	 s 	 	that	control	the	form	,	not	me	.
what	i	come	up	with	are	 form 	 s 	 	like	these	.
these	 form 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	made	up	of	weather	data	or	science	data	.
every	 color 	 ed 	 	 be 	 ad 	 	,	every	 color 	 ed 	 	string	,	 represent 	 s 	 	a	weather	element	.
and	together	,	these	 element 	 s 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	construct	the	form	,	but	they	 al 	 so 	 	reveal	 behavior 	 al 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	that	may	not	come	 a 	 cross 	 	through	a	two	-	dimensional	graph	.
when	you	step	 close 	 r 	 	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	that	it	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	all	made	up	of	 number 	 s 	 	.
the	 vert 	 ical 	 	 element 	 s 	 	are	 assign 	 ed 	 	a	specific	hour	of	the	day	.
so	all	the	way	around	,	you	have	a	24	-	hour	 time 	 line 	 	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	used	to	assign	a	temperature	range	.
on	that	grid	,	i	can	then	weave	the	high	tide	 read 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	water	temperature	,	air	temperature	and	moon	 phase 	 s 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 transl 	 ate 	 	weather	data	 in 	 to 	 	musical	 score 	 s 	 	.
and	musical	 not 	 ation 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	me	a	more	 nuance 	 d 	 	way	of	 transl 	 ating 	 	information	 with 	 out 	 	 com 	 promising 	 	it	.
so	all	of	these	 score 	 s 	 	are	made	up	of	weather	data	.
every	single	color	,	dot	,	every	single	line	,	is	a	weather	element	.
and	together	,	these	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	construct	a	score	.
i	use	these	 score 	 s 	 	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	with	 music 	 ians 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	1913	 tri 	 o 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	one	of	my	 piece 	 s 	 	at	the	milwaukee	art	museum	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	i	use	these	 score 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 blue 	 print 	 s 	 	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 sculpt 	 ural 	 	 form 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	function	still	in	the	sense	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	three	-	dimensional	weather	 visual 	 ization 	 	,	but	now	they	're	 embed 	 d 	 ing 	 	the	visual	 m 	 atrix 	 	of	the	musical	score	,	so	it	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	read	 a 	 s 	 	a	musical	score	.
what	i	love	about	 th 	 is 	 	work	is	that	it	 challeng 	 es 	 	our	 assumption 	 s 	 	of	what	kind	of	visual	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	 belong 	 s 	 	in	the	world	of	art	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	science	.
 th 	 is 	 	piece	here	is	read	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	where	you	place	it	.
you	place	it	in	an	art	museum	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
you	place	it	in	a	science	museum	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	three	-	dimensional	 visual 	 ization 	 	of	data	.
you	place	it	in	a	music	hall	,	it	all	of	a	sudden	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	musical	score	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 view 	 er 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	visual	language	is	part	of	science	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	art	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	music	.
the	other	reason	why	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 off 	 ers 	 	an	 alter 	 native 	 	entry	point	 in 	 to 	 	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	science	.
and	not	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	ph.d.	in	science	.
so	for	me	,	that	was	my	way	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
thank	you	.
