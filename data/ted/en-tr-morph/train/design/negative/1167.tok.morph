from	all	 out 	 ward 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 s 	 	,	john	had	 every 	 thing 	 	going	for	him	.
he	had	just	 sign 	 ed 	 	the	contract	to	sell	his	new	york	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	at	a	six	-	figure	profit	,	and	he	'd	 on 	 ly 	 	owned	it	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	school	where	he	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	with	his	master	's	had	just	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	him	a	 teach 	 ing 	 	appointment	,	which	 me 	 ant 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	,	but	 benefit 	 s 	 	for	the	first	time	in	 age 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	going	 re 	 ally 	 	well	for	john	,	he	was	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	,	 fight 	 ing 	 	 addict 	 ion 	 	and	a	 grip 	 ping 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
on	the	night	of	june	11th	,	2003	,	he	 climb 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	edge	of	the	 f 	 ence 	 	on	the	manhattan	bridge	and	he	 leap 	 ed 	 	to	the	 t 	 reach 	 er 	 ous 	 	 water 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	.
no	,	 miracul 	 ously 	 	--	he	lived	.
the	fall	 shatter 	 ed 	 	his	right	arm	,	broke	every	rib	that	he	had	,	 punctu 	 red 	 	his	lung	,	and	he	 drift 	 ed 	 	in	and	out	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	 a 	 s 	 	he	 drift 	 ed 	 	down	the	east	river	,	under	the	brooklyn	bridge	and	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 path 	 way 	 	of	the	staten	 is 	 land 	 	 ferr 	 y 	 	,	where	 passenger 	 s 	 	on	the	 ferr 	 y 	 	heard	his	 cri 	 es 	 	of	pain	,	 contact 	 ed 	 	the	boat	's	 cap 	 tain 	 	who	 contact 	 ed 	 	the	coast	guard	who	 fish 	 ed 	 	him	out	of	the	east	river	and	took	him	to	bellevue	hospital	.
and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	where	our	story	 begin 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	once	john	 commit 	 ted 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	 put 	 ting 	 	his	life	back	together	--	first	 physical 	 ly 	 	,	then	 emotion 	 ally 	 	,	and	then	 spiritual 	 ly 	 	--	he	found	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 resource 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 attempt 	 ed 	 	to	end	 the 	 ir 	 	life	in	the	way	that	he	did	.
research	 show 	 s 	 	that	19	out	of	20	people	who	attempt	 su 	 icide 	 	will	fail	.
but	the	people	who	fail	are	37	 time 	 s 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	succeed	the	second	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	is	an	at	-	risk	population	with	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 resource 	 s 	 	to	support	them	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	people	try	to	assemble	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	 taboo 	 s 	 	around	 su 	 icide 	 	,	we	're	not	 s 	 ure 	 	what	to	say	,	and	so	 quit 	 e 	 	often	we	say	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	 further 	 s 	 	the	 isol 	 ation 	 	that	people	like	john	found	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	.
i	know	john	's	story	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	john	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	first	time	in	any	sort	of	public	setting	i	've	ever	 acknowledg 	 ed 	 	the	journey	that	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	on	.
but	after	 hav 	 ing 	 	lost	a	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	teacher	in	2006	and	a	good	friend	last	year	to	 su 	 icide 	 	,	and	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	last	year	at	tedactive	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	step	out	of	my	silence	and	past	my	 taboo 	 s 	 	to	talk	about	an	idea	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	--	and	that	is	that	people	who	have	made	the	difficult	choice	to	come	back	to	life	need	more	 resource 	 s 	 	and	need	our	help	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	trevor	project	 say 	 s 	 	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	better	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	way	better	.
and	i	'm	 choos 	 ing 	 	to	come	out	of	a	 total 	 ly 	 	different	kind	of	 close 	 t 	 	 to 	 day 	 	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	,	to	urge	you	,	that	if	you	are	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 contempl 	 ated 	 	or	 attempt 	 ed 	 	 su 	 icide 	 	,	or	you	know	 some 	 body 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	,	talk	about	it	;	get	help	.
it	's	a	conversation	worth	 hav 	 ing 	 	and	an	idea	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
thank	you	.
