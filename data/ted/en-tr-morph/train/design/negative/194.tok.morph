thank	you	for	 put 	 ting 	 	up	these	 picture 	 s 	 	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	over	here	.
we	'll	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	them	.
now	,	i	'm	going	try	an	experiment	.	i	do	n't	do	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	.	i	'm	a	 theor 	 ist 	 	.
but	i	'm	going	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	i	press	 th 	 is 	 	button	.
 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.	ok	.	i	used	to	work	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	of	 element 	 ary 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	matter	if	you	chop	it	up	 ver 	 y 	 	fine	?
what	is	it	made	of	?
and	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	these	 particle 	 s 	 	are	valid	 through 	 out 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
we	know	a	lot	about	four	 force 	 s 	 	.	there	must	be	a	lot	more	,	but	 t 	 hose 	 	are	at	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 distance 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 interact 	 ed 	 	with	them	 ver 	 y 	 	much	yet	.
the	main	thing	i	want	to	talk	about	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	experience	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	of	fundamental	physics	that	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 cri 	 ter 	 ion 	 	for	 choos 	 ing 	 	the	right	 theor 	 y 	 	.
and	why	on	earth	could	that	be	so	?
well	,	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	my	own	experience	.
it	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	happen	.
three	or	four	of	us	,	in	1957	,	put	forward	a	 partial 	 ly 	 	complete	 theor 	 y 	 	of	one	of	these	 force 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	weak	force	.
and	it	was	in	 disagree 	 ment 	 	with	seven	--	seven	,	count	them	,	seven	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
 experiment 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	wrong	.
and	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	before	 know 	 ing 	 	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	was	so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	it	's	got	ta	be	right	!
the	 experiment 	 s 	 	had	to	be	wrong	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
now	our	friend	over	there	,	albert	einstein	,	used	to	pay	 ver 	 y 	 	little	attention	when	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	there	's	a	man	with	an	experiment	that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	disagree	with	special	 relat 	 ivity 	 	.
dc	miller	.	what	about	that	?	``	and	he	would	say	,	``	aw	,	that	'll	go	away	.	``
now	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	stuff	like	that	work	?	that	's	the	question	.
now	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	what	do	we	mean	by	 beaut 	 iful 	 	?	that	's	one	thing	.
i	'll	try	to	make	that	clear	--	 partial 	 ly 	 	clear	.
why	should	it	work	,	and	is	 th 	 is 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	?
i	'll	let	you	in	on	the	answer	to	the	last	one	that	i	 off 	 er 	 	,	and	that	is	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 where 	 	in	some	other	planet	,	 orbit 	 ing 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 di 	 stant 	 	star	,	 may 	 be 	 	in	a	 an 	 other 	 	 galax 	 y 	 	,	there	could	well	be	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	are	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	intelligent	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	,	and	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	science	.	it	's	not	 im 	 possible 	 	;	i	think	there	 prob 	 ably 	 	are	 lot 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	,	 non 	 e 	 	is	close	 en 	 ough 	 	to	interact	with	us	.
but	they	could	be	out	there	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
and	suppose	they	have	,	you	know	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 sensor 	 y 	 	apparatus	,	and	so	on	.
they	have	seven	 tent 	 acle 	 s 	 	,	and	they	have	14	little	funny	-	looking	 com 	 pound 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	a	brain	shaped	like	a	pretzel	.
would	they	 re 	 ally 	 	have	different	 law 	 s 	 	?
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	,	and	i	think	it	is	utter	baloney	.
i	think	there	are	 law 	 s 	 	out	there	,	and	we	of	course	do	n't	understand	them	at	any	 give 	 n 	 	time	 ver 	 y 	 	well	--	but	we	try	.	and	we	try	to	get	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	.
and	 some 	 day 	 	,	we	may	 actual 	 ly 	 	figure	out	the	fundamental	 un 	 ified 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	of	the	 particle 	 s 	 	and	 force 	 s 	 	,	what	i	call	the	``	fundamental	law	.	``
we	may	not	even	be	 terr 	 ibly 	 	far	from	it	.
but	even	if	we	do	n't	run	 a 	 cross 	 	it	in	our	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	,	we	can	still	think	there	is	one	out	there	,	and	we	're	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	to	it	.
i	think	that	's	the	main	point	to	be	made	.
we	express	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	.
and	when	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	--	when	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	some	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 not 	 ation 	 	,	you	can	write	the	 theor 	 y 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	brief	space	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	lot	of	 complic 	 ation 	 	--	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	we	mean	by	 beaut 	 y 	 	or	 e 	 leg 	 ance 	 	.
here	's	what	i	was	 say 	 ing 	 	about	the	 law 	 s 	 	.	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	there	.
newton	 certain 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	here	,	``	it	is	the	business	of	natural	 philosoph 	 y 	 	to	find	out	 t 	 hose 	 	 law 	 s 	 	.	``
the	 bas 	 ic 	 	law	,	let	's	say	--	here	's	an	assumption	.
the	assumption	is	that	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	law	 re 	 ally 	 	 take 	 s 	 	the	form	of	a	 un 	 ified 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	of	all	the	 particle 	 s 	 	.
now	,	some	people	call	that	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.
that	's	wrong	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 theor 	 y 	 	is	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 al 	 	.
and	i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	lot	of	stuff	about	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	and	what	it	's	like	,	and	so	on	.
you	've	heard	a	lot	of	wrong	 thing 	 s 	 	about	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
there	are	even	 movie 	 s 	 	about	it	with	a	lot	of	wrong	stuff	.
but	the	main	thing	here	is	that	it	 predict 	 s 	 	 prob 	 abilities 	 	.
now	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 prob 	 abilities 	 	are	near	 certain 	 ties 	 	.
and	in	a	lot	of	familiar	 case 	 s 	 	,	they	of	course	are	.
but	other	 time 	 s 	 	they	're	not	,	and	you	have	 on 	 ly 	 	 prob 	 abilities 	 	for	different	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
so	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	not	 determine 	 d 	 	just	by	the	fundamental	law	.
it	's	the	fundamental	law	and	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	long	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 accident 	 s 	 	,	or	chance	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	,	that	are	there	in	 add 	 ition 	 	.
and	the	fundamental	 theor 	 y 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	include	 t 	 hose 	 	chance	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	;	they	are	in	 add 	 ition 	 	.
so	it	's	not	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.	and	in	fact	,	a	huge	amount	of	the	information	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	around	us	 come 	 s 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 accident 	 s 	 	,	and	not	just	from	the	fundamental	 law 	 s 	 	.
now	,	it	's	often	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	fundamental	 law 	 s 	 	by	 exa 	 min 	 ing 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	at	low	 energ 	 ies 	 	,	and	then	 high 	 er 	 	 energ 	 ies 	 	,	and	then	 high 	 er 	 	 energ 	 ies 	 	,	or	short	 distance 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 short 	 er 	 	 distance 	 s 	 	,	and	then	still	 short 	 er 	 	 distance 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	,	is	like	 peel 	 ing 	 	the	skin	of	an	 on 	 ion 	 	.
and	we	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	and	build	more	 power 	 ful 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	 accele 	 rator 	 s 	 	for	 particle 	 s 	 	.
we	look	 deep 	 er 	 	and	 deep 	 er 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	structure	of	 particle 	 s 	 	,	and	in	that	way	we	get	 prob 	 ably 	 	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	fundamental	law	.
now	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	peel	these	 skin 	 s 	 	of	the	 on 	 ion 	 	,	and	we	get	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	law	,	we	see	that	each	skin	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	common	with	the	previous	one	,	and	with	the	next	one	.	we	write	them	out	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	,	and	we	see	they	use	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
they	 requir 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
that	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	,	and	that	is	a	central	feature	of	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	 to 	 day 	 	.
newton	 call 	 ed 	 	it	--	that	's	newton	,	by	the	way	--	that	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	albert	einstein	.	hi	,	al	!	and	 any 	 way 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	nature	 conform 	 able 	 	to	 her 	 self 	 	``	--	 person 	 ifying 	 	nature	 a 	 s 	 	a	female	.
and	so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	the	new	 phenomen 	 a 	 	,	the	new	 skin 	 s 	 	,	the	inner	 skin 	 s 	 	of	the	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 small 	 er 	 	 skin 	 s 	 	of	the	 on 	 ion 	 	that	we	get	to	,	resemble	the	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 large 	 r 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	the	kind	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	that	we	had	for	the	previous	skin	is	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	what	we	need	for	the	next	skin	.
and	that	's	why	the	 equ 	 ations 	 	look	so	simple	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	use	 mathematic 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	.
a	trivial	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	newton	found	the	law	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	which	 go 	 es 	 	like	one	over	the	square	of	the	distance	between	the	 thing 	 s 	 	 gravit 	 ated 	 	.
coulomb	,	in	france	,	found	the	same	law	for	electric	 charge 	 s 	 	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 similar 	 ity 	 	.
you	look	at	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	you	see	a	certain	law	.
then	you	look	at	 electric 	 ity 	 	.	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.	the	same	rule	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
symmetry	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
you	know	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	.	a	circle	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	symmetric	under	 rot 	 ations 	 	about	the	center	of	the	circle	.
you	 rot 	 ate 	 	around	the	center	of	the	circle	,	the	circle	 remain 	 s 	 	 un 	 change 	 d 	 	.
you	take	a	sphere	,	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	you	 rot 	 ate 	 	around	the	center	of	the	sphere	,	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 rot 	 ations 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	the	sphere	 al 	 one 	 	.
they	are	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	of	the	sphere	.
so	we	say	,	in	general	,	that	there	's	a	symmetry	under	certain	 operation 	 s 	 	if	 t 	 hose 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	or	 it 	 s 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	,	 un 	 change 	 d 	 	.
maxwell	's	 equ 	 ations 	 	are	of	course	 symmetric 	 al 	 	under	 rot 	 ations 	 	of	all	of	space	.
 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	if	we	turn	the	whole	of	space	around	by	some	angle	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	the	--	 do 	 es 	 	n't	change	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	or	 magnet 	 ism 	 	.
there	's	a	new	 not 	 ation 	 	in	the	19th	century	that	 express 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	if	you	use	that	 not 	 ation 	 	,	the	 equ 	 ations 	 	get	a	lot	 simpl 	 er 	 	.
then	einstein	,	with	his	special	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	a	whole	set	of	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	of	maxwell	's	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	which	are	 call 	 ed 	 	special	 relat 	 ivity 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	,	then	,	make	the	 equ 	 ations 	 	even	 short 	 er 	 	,	and	even	 pre 	 tti 	 er 	 	,	 there 	 fore 	 	.
let	's	look	.	you	do	n't	have	to	know	what	these	 thing 	 s 	 	mean	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
but	you	can	just	look	at	the	form	.	you	can	look	at	the	form	.
you	see	above	,	at	the	top	,	a	long	list	of	 equ 	 ations 	 	with	three	 component 	 s 	 	for	the	three	 direction 	 s 	 	of	space	:	x	,	y	and	z	.
then	,	using	vector	analysis	,	you	use	 rot 	 ation 	 al 	 	symmetry	,	and	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	next	set	.
then	you	use	the	symmetry	of	special	 relat 	 ivity 	 	and	you	get	an	even	 simpl 	 er 	 	set	down	here	,	 show 	 ing 	 	that	symmetry	 exhibit 	 s 	 	better	and	better	.
the	more	and	more	symmetry	you	have	,	the	better	you	exhibit	the	 simpl 	 icity 	 	and	 e 	 leg 	 ance 	 	of	the	 theor 	 y 	 	.
the	last	two	,	the	first	 equ 	 ation 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	electric	 charge 	 s 	 	and	 current 	 s 	 	give	rise	to	all	the	electric	and	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 field 	 s 	 	.
the	next	--	second	--	 equ 	 ation 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	there	is	no	 magnet 	 ism 	 	other	than	that	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 magnet 	 ism 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	electric	 charge 	 s 	 	and	 current 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 day 	 	we	may	find	some	 s 	 light 	 	hole	in	that	argument	.
but	for	the	moment	,	that	's	the	case	.
now	,	here	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	not	heard	of	.
they	should	have	heard	of	it	,	but	it	's	a	little	 trick 	 y 	 	to	explain	in	technical	detail	,	so	i	wo	n't	do	it	.	i	'll	just	 ment 	 ion 	 	it	.
but	chen	ning	 y 	 ang 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	by	us	``	frank	``	 y 	 ang 	 	--	--	and	bob	 mill 	 s 	 	put	forward	,	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 th 	 is 	 	 general 	 ization 	 	of	maxwell	's	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	with	a	new	symmetry	.
a	whole	new	symmetry	.
 mathematic 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	,	but	there	was	a	whole	new	symmetry	.
they	 hop 	 ed 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	would	 con 	 tribute 	 	 some 	 how 	 	to	particle	physics	--	did	n't	.	it	did	n't	,	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	particle	physics	.
but	then	some	of	us	 general 	 ized 	 	it	further	.	and	then	it	did	!
and	it	 g 	 ave 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	strong	force	and	of	the	weak	force	.
so	here	we	say	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	we	 s 	 aid 	 	before	:	that	each	skin	of	the	 on 	 ion 	 	 show 	 s 	 	a	 similar 	 ity 	 	to	the	 ad 	 join 	 ing 	 	 skin 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	for	the	 ad 	 join 	 ing 	 	 skin 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	what	we	need	for	the	new	one	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	how	to	write	it	in	a	 love 	 ly 	 	,	 con 	 cise 	 	way	.
so	here	are	the	 theme 	 s 	 	.	we	 believ 	 e 	 	there	is	a	 un 	 ified 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	all	the	 regular 	 ities 	 	.
 step 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 un 	 ification 	 	exhibit	the	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
symmetry	 exhibit 	 s 	 	the	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
and	then	there	is	self	-	 similar 	 ity 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 scale 	 s 	 	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	from	one	skin	of	the	 on 	 ion 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
proximate	self	-	 similar 	 ity 	 	.	and	that	 account 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
that	will	account	for	why	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	a	 success 	 ful 	 	 cri 	 ter 	 ion 	 	for	 select 	 ing 	 	the	right	 theor 	 y 	 	.
here	's	what	newton	 him 	 self 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	:	``	nature	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 son 	 ant 	 	and	 conform 	 able 	 	to	her	self	.	``
one	thing	he	was	 think 	 ing 	 	of	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	most	of	us	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	in	his	day	it	was	n't	taken	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
there	's	the	story	,	which	is	not	 absolute 	 ly 	 	certain	to	be	right	,	but	a	lot	of	people	told	it	.
four	 source 	 s 	 	told	it	.	that	when	they	had	the	plague	in	cambridge	,	and	he	went	down	to	his	mother	's	farm	--	 be 	 cause 	 	the	university	was	closed	--	he	saw	an	apple	fall	from	a	tree	,	or	on	his	head	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	he	 real 	 ized 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	that	the	force	that	drew	the	apple	down	to	the	earth	could	be	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	force	 regulat 	 ing 	 	the	 motion 	 s 	 	of	the	 planet 	 s 	 	and	the	moon	.
that	was	a	big	 un 	 ification 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 to 	 day 	 	we	take	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	the	same	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	principle	of	nature	,	 con 	 son 	 ance 	 	:	``	 th 	 is 	 	principle	of	nature	 be 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	remote	from	the	 conception 	 s 	 	of	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	,	i	 for 	 bore 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	in	that	book	,	 l 	 est 	 	i	should	be	 account 	 ed 	 	an	 extra 	 vag 	 ant 	 	freak	...	``	that	's	what	we	all	have	to	watch	out	for	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
``	...	and	so	prejudice	my	 read 	 ers 	 	against	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	the	main	design	of	the	book	.	``
now	,	who	 to 	 day 	 	would	claim	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	mere	 conce 	 it 	 	of	the	human	mind	?
that	the	force	that	 cause 	 s 	 	the	apple	to	fall	to	the	ground	is	the	same	force	that	 cause 	 s 	 	the	 planet 	 s 	 	and	the	moon	to	move	around	,	and	so	on	?	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	.	it	's	a	 proper 	 ty 	 	of	 gravit 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	human	mind	.	the	human	mind	can	,	of	course	,	appreciate	it	and	enjoy	it	,	use	it	,	but	it	's	not	--	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	stem	from	the	human	mind	.
it	 stem 	 s 	 	from	the	character	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
and	that	's	true	of	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
they	are	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	the	fundamental	law	.
the	fundamental	law	is	 s 	 uch 	 	that	the	different	 skin 	 s 	 	of	the	 on 	 ion 	 	resemble	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	the	math	for	one	skin	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	express	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	the	next	skin	.
i	say	here	that	newton	did	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	year	:	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	motion	,	the	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	white	light	 compose 	 d 	 	of	all	the	 color 	 s 	 	of	the	 rain 	 bow 	 	.
and	he	could	have	written	 quit 	 e 	 	an	essay	on	``	what	i	did	over	my	summer	 vac 	 ation 	 	.	``
so	we	do	n't	have	to	 assum 	 e 	 	these	 principle 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	 meta 	 physical 	 	 post 	 ulate 	 s 	 	.
they	follow	from	the	fundamental	 theor 	 y 	 	.
they	are	what	we	call	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
you	do	n't	need	--	you	do	n't	need	 some 	 thing 	 	more	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	more	.
that	's	what	emergence	 mean 	 s 	 	.
life	can	emerge	from	physics	and	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	plus	a	lot	of	 accident 	 s 	 	.
the	human	mind	can	arise	from	 neuro 	 biology 	 	and	a	lot	of	 accident 	 s 	 	,	the	way	the	chemical	bond	 arise 	 s 	 	from	physics	and	certain	 accident 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	diminish	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	these	 subject 	 s 	 	to	know	that	they	follow	from	more	fundamental	 thing 	 s 	 	,	plus	 accident 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	general	rule	,	and	it	's	 critical 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	.
you	do	n't	need	 some 	 thing 	 	more	in	order	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	more	.
people	keep	 ask 	 ing 	 	that	when	they	read	my	book	,	``	the	 quar 	 k 	 	and	the	jaguar	,	``	and	they	say	,	``	is	n't	there	 some 	 thing 	 	more	beyond	what	you	have	there	?	``
 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	,	they	mean	 some 	 thing 	 	 super 	 natural 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	there	is	n't	.
you	do	n't	need	 some 	 thing 	 	more	to	explain	 some 	 thing 	 	more	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
