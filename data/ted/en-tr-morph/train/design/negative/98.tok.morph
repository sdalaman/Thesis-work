after	all	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	obvious	that	the	earth	is	large	and	 motion 	 less 	 	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	small	and	mobile	.	but	it	's	worth	 recall 	 ing 	 	wittgenstein	's	remark	on	the	subject	.
``	tell	me	,	``	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	friend	,	``	why	do	people	 al 	 ways 	 	say	,	it	was	natural	for	man	to	 assum 	 e 	 	that	the	 s 	 un 	 	went	round	the	earth	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	that	the	earth	was	 rot 	 ating 	 	?	``

science	 ha 	 s 	 	taught	us	,	against	all	 intuit 	 ion 	 	,	that	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	solid	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	 crystal 	 s 	 	and	 rock 	 s 	 	,	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 compose 	 d 	 	of	empty	space	.

haldane	 guess 	 es 	 	that	a	dog	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	able	to	place	the	 acid 	 s 	 	in	the	order	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 weight 	 s 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 smell 	 s 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	man	could	place	a	number	of	piano	 wire 	 s 	 	in	the	order	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 length 	 s 	 	by	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 note 	 s 	 	.
now	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	fatty	acid	,	capric	acid	,	which	is	just	like	the	other	two	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	two	more	carbon	 atom 	 s 	 	.
a	dog	that	had	never	met	capric	acid	would	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	have	no	more	trouble	 imagin 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	smell	than	we	would	have	trouble	 imagin 	 ing 	 	a	 trump 	 et 	 	,	say	,	 play 	 ing 	 	one	note	 high 	 er 	 	than	we	've	heard	a	 trump 	 et 	 	play	before	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	and	 rhino 	 s 	 	and	other	smell	-	oriented	 animal 	 s 	 	smell	in	color	.	and	the	argument	would	be	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	for	the	 bat 	 s 	 	.

we	're	blind	to	all	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	 out 	 side 	 	that	,	 un 	 less 	 	we	use	 instrument 	 s 	 	to	help	us	.
middle	world	is	the	narrow	range	of	 re 	 ality 	 	which	we	 judg 	 e 	 	to	be	normal	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	the	 que 	 er 	 ness 	 	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
we	could	make	a	similar	scale	of	 im 	 prob 	 abilities 	 	;	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	 total 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
 miracle 	 s 	 	are	just	 event 	 s 	 	that	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	.
a	 mar 	 ble 	 	statue	could	wave	 it 	 s 	 	hand	at	us	;	the	 atom 	 s 	 	that	make	up	 it 	 s 	 	 crystall 	 ine 	 	structure	are	all	 vib 	 rating 	 	back	and	forth	 any 	 way 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	 agree 	 ment 	 	among	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 prefer 	 red 	 	direction	of	 move 	 ment 	 	,	the	 mar 	 ble 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	it	in	middle	world	,	 stay 	 s 	 	rock	 stead 	 y 	 	.
but	the	 atom 	 s 	 	in	the	hand	could	all	just	happen	to	move	the	same	way	at	the	same	time	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	hand	would	move	and	we	'd	see	it	 wav 	 ing 	 	at	us	in	middle	world	.	the	 odd 	 s 	 	against	it	,	of	course	,	are	so	great	that	if	you	set	out	writing	 zero 	 s 	 	at	the	time	of	the	origin	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	you	still	would	not	have	written	 en 	 ough 	 	 zero 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	.
evolution	in	middle	world	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 equi 	 pped 	 	us	to	handle	 ver 	 y 	 	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	 event 	 s 	 	;	we	do	n't	live	long	 en 	 ough 	 	.
in	the	 vast 	 ness 	 	of	astronomical	space	and	 geo 	 logical 	 	time	,	that	which	 seem 	 s 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	in	middle	world	might	turn	out	to	be	 inevit 	 able 	 	.
one	way	to	think	about	that	is	by	 count 	 ing 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	there	are	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	but	a	good	estimate	is	about	10	to	the	20	,	or	100	billion	billion	.
and	that	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	nice	way	to	express	our	estimate	of	life	's	 im 	 prob 	 ability 	 	.
could	make	some	sort	of	 land 	 mark 	 	 point 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	a	spectrum	of	 im 	 prob 	 ability 	 	,	which	might	look	like	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	spectrum	we	just	 look 	 ed 	 	at	.
if	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 arise 	 n 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	once	on	any	--	if	--	if	life	could	--	i	mean	,	life	could	 origin 	 ate 	 	once	per	planet	,	could	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	common	,	or	it	could	 origin 	 ate 	 	once	per	star	,	or	once	per	 galax 	 y 	 	or	 may 	 be 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	once	in	the	entire	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	in	which	case	it	would	have	to	be	here	.	and	 some 	 where 	 	up	there	would	be	the	chance	that	a	frog	would	turn	 in 	 to 	 	a	prince	and	similar	 magic 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
if	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 arise 	 n 	 	on	 on 	 ly 	 	one	planet	in	the	entire	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	that	planet	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	our	planet	,	 be 	 cause 	 	here	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	if	we	want	to	avail	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	of	it	,	we	're	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	 post 	 ulate 	 	chemical	 event 	 s 	 	in	the	origin	of	life	which	have	a	 prob 	 ability 	 	 a 	 s 	 	low	 a 	 s 	 	one	in	100	billion	billion	.
i	do	n't	think	we	 s 	 hall 	 	have	to	avail	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	of	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	suspect	that	life	is	 quit 	 e 	 	common	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	when	i	say	 quit 	 e 	 	common	,	it	could	still	be	so	rare	that	no	one	 is 	 land 	 	of	life	ever	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	,	which	is	a	 s 	 ad 	 	thought	.
how	 s 	 hall 	 	we	interpret	``	 que 	 er 	 er 	 	than	we	can	suppose	?	``
 que 	 er 	 er 	 	than	can	in	principle	be	 suppose 	 d 	 	,	or	just	 que 	 er 	 er 	 	than	we	can	suppose	,	 give 	 n 	 	the	 limit 	 ations 	 	of	our	brain	's	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 apprentice 	 ship 	 	in	middle	world	?
could	we	,	by	training	and	practice	,	 emancip 	 ate 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	middle	world	and	 achiev 	 e 	 	some	sort	of	intuitive	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	small	and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	?	i	 genuine 	 ly 	 	do	n't	know	the	answer	.
i	wonder	 whet 	 her 	 	we	might	help	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	understand	,	say	,	 quant 	 um 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	,	if	we	 br 	 ought 	 	up	children	to	play	computer	 game 	 s 	 	,	 begin 	 ning 	 	in	early	 child 	 hood 	 	,	which	had	a	sort	of	make	-	 believ 	 e 	 	world	of	 ball 	 s 	 	going	through	two	 s 	 lit 	 s 	 	on	a	screen	,	a	world	in	which	the	strange	 going 	 s 	 	on	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 enlarg 	 ed 	 	by	the	computer	's	make	-	 believ 	 e 	 	,	so	that	they	 be 	 came 	 	familiar	on	the	middle	-	world	scale	of	the	stream	.
and	,	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	a	 relat 	 iv 	 istic 	 	computer	game	in	which	 object 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	manifest	the	lorenz	 contract 	 ion 	 	,	and	so	on	,	to	try	to	get	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	--	get	children	 in 	 to 	 	the	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
i	want	to	end	by	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	the	idea	of	middle	world	to	our	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	of	each	other	.
most	 scientist 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 sub 	 scribe 	 	to	a	 mechan 	 istic 	 	view	of	the	mind	:	we	're	the	way	we	are	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 brain 	 s 	 	are	wired	up	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	;	our	 hormone 	 s 	 	are	the	way	they	are	.
we	'd	be	different	,	our	 character 	 s 	 	would	be	different	,	if	our	neuro	-	anatomy	and	our	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 we 	 re 	 	different	.
but	we	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 in 	 consist 	 ent 	 	.	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 	,	our	 respons 	 e 	 	to	a	 mis 	 behav 	 ing 	 	person	,	like	a	child	-	 murder 	 er 	 	,	should	be	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	 th 	 is 	 	unit	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 fault 	 y 	 	component	;	it	 need 	 s 	 	 repair 	 ing 	 	.	that	's	not	what	we	say	.
what	we	say	--	and	i	include	the	most	 austere 	 ly 	 	 mechan 	 istic 	 	among	us	,	which	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	me	--	what	we	say	is	,	``	 vil 	 e 	 	 mon 	 ster 	 	,	 pri 	 son 	 	is	too	good	for	you	.	``
or	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	we	seek	 re 	 venge 	 	,	in	all	 prob 	 ability 	 	 there 	 by 	 	 trigger 	 ing 	 	the	next	phase	in	an	 escal 	 ating 	 	cycle	of	counter	-	 re 	 venge 	 	,	which	we	see	,	of	course	,	all	over	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
in	short	,	when	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	like	 academic 	 s 	 	,	we	regard	people	 a 	 s 	 	elaborate	and	 complic 	 ated 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	like	 computer 	 s 	 	or	 car 	 s 	 	,	but	when	we	 re 	 vert 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	human	we	 behav 	 e 	 	more	like	basil	fawlty	,	who	,	we	remember	,	 thra 	 shed 	 	his	car	to	teach	it	a	 less 	 on 	 	when	it	would	n't	start	on	gourmet	night	.
the	reason	we	 person 	 ify 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 car 	 s 	 	and	 computer 	 s 	 	is	that	just	 a 	 s 	 	 monkey 	 s 	 	live	in	an	 ar 	 bore 	 al 	 	world	and	 mole 	 s 	 	live	in	an	 under 	 ground 	 	world	and	water	 strid 	 ers 	 	live	in	a	surface	tension	-	 dominate 	 d 	 	 flat 	 land 	 	,	we	live	in	a	social	world	.	we	swim	through	a	sea	of	people	--	a	social	version	of	middle	world	.

if	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 que 	 er 	 er 	 	than	we	can	suppose	,	is	it	just	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	 select 	 ed 	 	to	suppose	 on 	 ly 	 	what	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	suppose	in	order	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	in	the	 ple 	 ist 	 ocene 	 	of	africa	?
