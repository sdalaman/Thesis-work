so	,	if	you	're	in	the	audience	 to 	 day 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	you	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	in	some	other	time	or	place	,	you	are	a	 particip 	 ant 	 	in	the	digital	 right 	 s 	 	 eco 	 system 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	an	artist	,	a	 techno 	 logist 	 	,	a	lawyer	or	a	fan	,	the	 hand 	 ling 	 	of	 copy 	 right 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	your	life	.
 right 	 s 	 	management	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	question	of	 owner 	 ship 	 	,	it	's	a	complex	web	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	and	a	critical	part	of	our	cultural	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
youtube	 care 	 s 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	about	the	 right 	 s 	 	of	content	 owner 	 s 	 	,	but	in	order	to	give	them	 choice 	 s 	 	about	what	they	can	do	with	copies	,	 mash 	 up 	 s 	 	and	more	,	we	need	to	first	identify	when	 copy 	 right 	 ed 	 	material	is	 upload 	 ed 	 	to	our	 s 	 ite 	 	.
let	's	look	at	a	specific	video	so	you	can	see	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 record 	 ing 	 	artist	chris	 brow 	 n 	 	released	the	official	video	of	his	single	``	 fore 	 ver 	 	.	``
a	fan	saw	it	on	tv	,	 record 	 ed 	 	it	with	her	camera	phone	,	and	 upload 	 ed 	 	it	to	youtube	.
 be 	 cause 	 	sony	music	had	 register 	 ed 	 	chris	 brow 	 n 	 	's	video	in	our	content	id	system	,	 with 	 in 	 	 second 	 s 	 	of	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	upload	the	video	,	the	copy	was	 detect 	 ed 	 	,	giving	sony	the	choice	of	what	to	do	next	.
but	how	do	we	know	that	the	user	's	video	was	a	copy	?
well	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	with	content	 owner 	 s 	 	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 asset 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 data 	 base 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	a	 us 	 age 	 	policy	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	what	to	do	when	we	find	a	match	.
we	 compar 	 e 	 	each	upload	against	all	of	the	 re 	 ference 	 	 file 	 s 	 	in	our	 data 	 base 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	heat	map	is	going	to	show	you	how	the	brain	of	the	system	 work 	 s 	 	.
here	we	can	see	the	original	 re 	 ference 	 	file	 be 	 ing 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	user	generated	content	.
the	system	 compar 	 es 	 	every	moment	of	one	to	the	other	to	see	if	there	's	a	match	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	can	identify	a	match	even	if	the	copy	used	is	just	a	 port 	 ion 	 	of	the	original	file	,	 play 	 s 	 	it	in	 s 	 low 	 	motion	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	audio	and	video	quality	.
and	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	every	time	that	a	video	is	 upload 	 ed 	 	to	youtube	.
and	that	's	over	20	 hour 	 s 	 	of	video	every	minute	.
when	we	find	a	match	,	we	 app 	 ly 	 	the	policy	that	the	 right 	 s 	 	owner	 ha 	 s 	 	set	down	.
and	the	scale	and	the	speed	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 breath 	 taking 	 	.
we	're	not	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	few	 video 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	over	100	 year 	 s 	 	of	video	every	day	,	between	new	 upload 	 s 	 	and	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	we	 regular 	 ly 	 	do	 a 	 cross 	 	all	of	the	content	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
when	we	 compar 	 e 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	of	video	,	we	're	 compar 	 ing 	 	it	against	 million 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ference 	 	 file 	 s 	 	in	our	 data 	 base 	 	.
it	would	be	like	36,000	people	 star 	 ing 	 	at	36,000	 monitor 	 s 	 	each	and	every	day	,	 with 	 out 	 	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	a	coffee	break	.
now	,	what	do	we	do	when	we	find	a	match	?
well	,	most	 right 	 s 	 	 owner 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 block 	 ing 	 	,	will	allow	the	copy	to	be	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	they	benefit	through	the	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	and	linked	 sale 	 s 	 	.
remember	chris	 brow 	 n 	 	's	video	``	 fore 	 ver 	 	``	?
well	,	it	had	 it 	 s 	 	day	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	then	it	 drop 	 ped 	 	off	the	 chart 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 look 	 ed 	 	like	the	end	of	the	story	,	but	 some 	 time 	 	last	year	,	a	young	couple	got	married	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	video	.
you	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	it	.
what	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	if	the	 process 	 ional 	 	of	the	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	much	 f 	 un 	 	,	can	you	imagine	how	much	 f 	 un 	 	the	 re 	 ception 	 	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	?
i	mean	,	who	are	these	people	?
i	 total 	 ly 	 	want	to	go	to	that	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
so	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	video	went	on	to	get	over	40	million	 view 	 s 	 	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	sony	 block 	 ing 	 	,	they	 allow 	 ed 	 	the	upload	to	occur	.
and	they	put	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	against	it	and	linked	from	it	to	itunes	.
and	the	song	,	18	 month 	 s 	 	old	,	went	back	to	number	four	on	the	itunes	 chart 	 s 	 	.
so	sony	is	generating	revenue	from	both	of	these	.
and	jill	and	kevin	,	the	happy	couple	,	they	came	back	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 honey 	 moon 	 	and	found	that	 the 	 ir 	 	video	had	gone	crazy	viral	.
and	they	've	 end 	 ed 	 	up	on	a	bunch	of	talk	 show 	 s 	 	,	and	they	've	used	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
the	video	's	inspired	over	26,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 don 	 ations 	 	to	end	domestic	violence	.
the	``	jk	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	[	 en 	 trance 	 	]	dance	``	 be 	 came 	 	so	popular	that	nbc	 paro 	 di 	 ed 	 	it	on	the	season	 final 	 e 	 	of	``	the	 off 	 ice 	 	,	``	which	just	 go 	 es 	 	to	show	,	it	's	 tru 	 ly 	 	an	 eco 	 system 	 	of	culture	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	just	 amateur 	 s 	 	 borrow 	 ing 	 	from	big	 studio 	 s 	 	,	but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	big	 studio 	 s 	 	 borrow 	 ing 	 	back	.
by	 empower 	 ing 	 	choice	,	we	can	create	a	culture	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
and	all	it	took	to	change	 thing 	 s 	 	around	was	to	allow	for	choice	through	 right 	 s 	 	 ident 	 ification 	 	.
so	why	 ha 	 s 	 	no	one	ever	 solve 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	problem	before	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	big	problem	,	and	it	's	 complic 	 ated 	 	and	 mess 	 y 	 	.
it	's	not	 un 	 common 	 	for	a	single	video	to	have	 multi 	 ple 	 	 right 	 s 	 	 owner 	 s 	 	.
there	's	musical	 label 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 multi 	 ple 	 	music	 publish 	 ers 	 	.
and	each	of	these	can	vary	by	country	.
there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 case 	 s 	 	where	we	have	more	than	one	work	 mash 	 ed 	 	together	.
so	we	have	to	manage	 man 	 y 	 	 claim 	 s 	 	to	the	same	video	.
youtube	's	content	id	system	 address 	 es 	 	all	of	these	 case 	 s 	 	.
but	the	system	 on 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	through	the	 particip 	 ation 	 	of	 right 	 s 	 	 owner 	 s 	 	.
if	you	have	content	that	 other 	 s 	 	are	 upload 	 ing 	 	to	youtube	,	you	should	register	in	the	content	id	system	,	and	then	you	'll	have	the	choice	about	how	your	content	is	used	.
and	think	 care 	 fully 	 	about	the	 poli 	 cies 	 	that	you	attach	to	that	content	.
by	 simpl 	 y 	 	 block 	 ing 	 	all	 re 	 use 	 	,	you	'll	 mis 	 s 	 	out	on	new	art	 form 	 s 	 	,	new	 audience 	 s 	 	,	new	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 channel 	 s 	 	and	new	revenue	 stream 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	not	just	about	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	 impression 	 s 	 	.
just	look	at	all	the	joy	that	was	spread	through	 progress 	 ive 	 	 right 	 s 	 	management	and	new	technology	.
and	i	think	we	can	all	agree	that	joy	is	 definite 	 ly 	 	an	idea	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
thank	you	.
