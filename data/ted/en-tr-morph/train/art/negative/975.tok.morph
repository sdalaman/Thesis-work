imagine	,	if	you	will	--	a	gift	.
i	'd	like	for	you	to	picture	it	in	your	mind	.

so	envision	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	all	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	.
but	before	i	show	you	what	's	 in 	 side 	 	,	i	will	tell	you	,	it	's	going	to	do	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	you	.

you	will	feel	 love 	 d 	 	and	 appreciate 	 d 	 	like	never	before	and	 re 	 connect 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 acquaint 	 ance 	 s 	 	you	have	n't	heard	from	in	 year 	 s 	 	.
adoration	and	 admi 	 ration 	 	will	overwhelm	you	.
it	will	 re 	 calibrate 	 	what	's	most	 import 	 ant 	 	in	your	life	.
it	will	 re 	 define 	 	your	sense	of	 spiritual 	 ity 	 	and	faith	.
you	'll	have	a	new	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	trust	in	your	body	.
you	'll	have	 un 	 surpass 	 ed 	 	 vital 	 ity 	 	and	energy	.
you	'll	expand	your	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	,	meet	new	people	,	and	you	'll	have	a	 health 	 ier 	 	 life 	 style 	 	.
and	get	 th 	 is 	 	--	you	'll	have	an	eight	-	week	 vac 	 ation 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
you	'll	eat	 count 	 less 	 	gourmet	 meal 	 s 	 	.
 flower 	 s 	 	will	 arriv 	 e 	 	by	the	 truck 	 load 	 	.
people	will	say	to	you	,	``	you	look	great	.	have	you	had	any	work	 d 	 one 	 	?	``
and	you	'll	have	a	 life 	 time 	 	supply	of	good	 drug 	 s 	 	.

the	price	?
$	55,000	,	and	that	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	deal	.
by	now	i	know	you	're	 dy 	 ing 	 	to	know	what	it	is	and	where	you	can	get	one	.
 do 	 es 	 	amazon	carry	it	?
 do 	 es 	 	it	have	the	apple	logo	on	it	?
is	there	a	 wait 	 ing 	 	list	?
not	 like 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	gift	came	to	me	about	five	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	 look 	 ed 	 	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	when	it	was	all	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	--	not	 quit 	 e 	 	so	 pre 	 tty 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	was	a	rare	gem	--	a	brain	tumor	,	hemangioblastoma	--	the	gift	that	 keep 	 s 	 	on	giving	.
and	while	i	'm	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	now	,	i	would	n't	wish	 th 	 is 	 	gift	for	you	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	you	'd	want	it	.
but	i	would	n't	change	my	experience	.
it	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 alter 	 ed 	 	my	life	in	ways	i	did	n't	expect	in	all	the	ways	i	just	 share 	 d 	 	with	you	.
so	the	next	time	you	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	 un 	 want 	 ed 	 	and	 un 	 certain 	 	,	consider	that	it	just	may	be	a	gift	.
