just	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	picture	about	10	 block 	 s 	 	from	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	grand	cafe	here	in	oxford	.
i	took	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	the	first	 coffee 	 house 	 	to	open	in	england	in	1650	.
that	's	 it 	 s 	 	great	claim	to	fame	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	it	to	you	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	give	you	the	kind	of	starbucks	tour	of	historic	england	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	english	 coffee 	 house 	 	was	 cruci 	 al 	 	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	spread	of	one	of	the	great	intellectual	 flower 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	last	500	 year 	 s 	 	,	what	we	now	call	the	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
and	the	 coffee 	 house 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	role	in	the	birth	of	the	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	,	in	part	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	people	 we 	 re 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	there	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	before	the	spread	of	coffee	and	tea	through	british	culture	,	what	people	 d 	 rank 	 	--	both	elite	and	mass	 folk 	 s 	 	 d 	 rank 	 	--	day	-	in	and	day	-	out	,	from	dawn	 un 	 til 	 	 du 	 s 	 k 	 	was	alcohol	.
alcohol	was	the	 day 	 time 	 	beverage	of	choice	.
you	would	drink	a	little	beer	with	 break 	 fast 	 	and	have	a	little	wine	at	lunch	,	a	little	gin	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	around	1650	--	and	top	it	off	with	a	little	beer	and	wine	at	the	end	of	the	day	.
that	was	the	 health 	 y 	 	choice	--	right	--	 be 	 cause 	 	the	water	was	n't	safe	to	drink	.
and	so	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	rise	of	the	 coffee 	 house 	 	,	you	had	an	entire	population	that	was	 effective 	 ly 	 	drunk	all	day	.
and	you	can	imagine	what	that	would	be	like	,	right	,	in	your	own	life	--	and	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	of	some	of	you	--	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	all	day	,	and	then	you	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	from	a	 depress 	 ant 	 	to	a	 stimul 	 ant 	 	in	your	life	,	you	would	have	better	 idea 	 s 	 	.
you	would	be	 sharp 	 er 	 	and	more	alert	.
and	so	it	's	not	an	accident	that	a	great	 flower 	 ing 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	england	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	to	tea	and	coffee	.
but	the	other	thing	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	 coffee 	 house 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	the	space	.
it	was	a	space	where	people	would	get	together	from	different	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	,	different	 field 	 s 	 	of	 expert 	 ise 	 	,	and	share	.
it	was	a	space	,	 a 	 s 	 	matt	ridley	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	where	 idea 	 s 	 	could	have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 the 	 ir 	 	 con 	 jug 	 al 	 	bed	,	in	a	sense	--	 idea 	 s 	 	would	get	together	there	.
and	an	 astonish 	 ing 	 	number	of	 innov 	 ations 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	period	have	a	 coffee 	 house 	 	 some 	 where 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	story	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	time	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 coffee 	 house 	 s 	 	for	the	last	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	kind	of	on	 th 	 is 	 	quest	to	investigate	 th 	 is 	 	question	of	where	good	 idea 	 s 	 	come	from	.
what	are	the	 environment 	 s 	 	that	lead	to	 un 	 usual 	 	 level 	 s 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 un 	 usual 	 	 level 	 s 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	?
what	's	the	kind	of	 environment 	 al 	 	--	what	is	the	space	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	?
and	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	both	 environment 	 s 	 	like	the	 coffee 	 house 	 	;	i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	media	 environment 	 s 	 	,	like	the	world	wide	web	,	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	;	i	've	gone	back	to	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	first	cities	;	i	've	even	gone	to	 bio 	 logical 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	,	like	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	and	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	,	that	involve	 un 	 usual 	 	 level 	 s 	 	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	;	and	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	for	is	 share 	 d 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	kind	of	signature	behavior	that	 show 	 s 	 	up	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	in	all	of	these	 environment 	 s 	 	.
are	there	 recur 	 ring 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	we	can	learn	from	,	that	we	can	take	and	kind	of	 app 	 ly 	 	to	our	own	 live 	 s 	 	,	or	our	own	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	or	our	own	 environment 	 s 	 	to	make	them	more	creative	and	 innov 	 ative 	 	?
and	i	think	i	've	found	a	few	.
but	what	you	have	to	do	to	make	sense	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	to	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	these	 principle 	 s 	 	is	you	have	to	do	away	with	a	lot	of	the	way	in	which	our	 convention 	 al 	 	 metaphor 	 s 	 	and	language	 steer 	 s 	 	us	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	certain	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	idea	-	creation	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	inspiration	.
we	have	the	kind	of	the	flash	of	 in 	 sight 	 	,	the	stroke	of	 in 	 sight 	 	,	we	have	 epiph 	 anie 	 s 	 	,	we	have	``	eureka	!	``	 moment 	 s 	 	,	we	have	the	 light 	 bulb 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	right	?
all	of	these	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	kind	of	 rhetoric 	 ally 	 	 flor 	 id 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	,	share	 th 	 is 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	assumption	,	which	is	that	an	idea	is	a	single	thing	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	often	in	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 illumi 	 nating 	 	moment	.
but	in	fact	,	what	i	would	 argu 	 e 	 	and	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	kind	of	begin	with	is	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	an	idea	is	a	network	on	the	most	 element 	 al 	 	level	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	your	brain	.
an	idea	--	a	new	idea	--	is	a	new	network	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	 fir 	 ing 	 	in	sync	with	each	other	 in 	 side 	 	your	brain	.
it	's	a	new	 configu 	 ration 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 form 	 ed 	 	before	.
and	the	question	is	:	how	do	you	get	your	brain	 in 	 to 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	where	these	new	 network 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	form	?
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	,	in	fact	,	the	kind	of	network	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	mimic	a	lot	of	the	network	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	the	internal	world	of	the	human	brain	.
so	the	metaphor	i	'd	like	the	use	i	can	take	from	a	story	of	a	great	idea	that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	--	a	lot	more	 re 	 cent 	 	than	the	1650s	.
a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	guy	named	timothy	prestero	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	...	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	design	that	 matter 	 s 	 	.
they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	tackle	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 press 	 ing 	 	problem	of	,	you	know	,	the	 terr 	 ible 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	we	have	with	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rates	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	we	know	,	by	 get 	 ting 	 	modern	 neo 	 natal 	 	 incub 	 ators 	 	 in 	 to 	 	any	 con 	 text 	 	,	if	we	can	keep	 pre 	 mature 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	warm	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	--	we	can	 halv 	 e 	 	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rates	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	technology	is	there	.
these	are	standard	in	all	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	 world 	 s 	 	.
the	problem	is	,	if	you	buy	a	$	40,000	 incub 	 ator 	 	,	and	you	 s 	 end 	 	it	off	to	a	mid	-	sized	village	in	africa	,	it	will	work	great	for	a	year	or	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 some 	 thing 	 	will	go	wrong	and	it	will	break	,	and	it	will	remain	broken	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	have	a	whole	system	of	spare	 part 	 s 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	have	the	on	-	the	-	ground	 expert 	 ise 	 	to	fix	 th 	 is 	 	$	40,000	piece	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
and	so	you	end	up	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	problem	where	you	 s 	 pend 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	money	 get 	 ting 	 	aid	and	all	these	 advance 	 d 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	to	these	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	then	it	 end 	 s 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	 use 	 less 	 	.
so	what	prestero	and	his	team	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	is	to	look	around	and	see	:	what	are	the	abundant	 resource 	 s 	 	in	these	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	?
and	what	they	 notice 	 d 	 	was	they	do	n't	have	a	lot	of	dvrs	,	they	do	n't	have	a	lot	of	 micro 	 wave 	 s 	 	,	but	they	seem	to	do	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	job	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 s 	 	on	the	road	.
there	's	a	toyota	 fore 	 runner 	 	on	the	street	in	all	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
they	seem	to	have	the	 expert 	 ise 	 	to	keep	 car 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
so	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	,	``	could	we	build	a	 neo 	 natal 	 	 incub 	 ator 	 	that	's	built	 entire 	 ly 	 	out	of	 auto 	 mobile 	 	 part 	 s 	 	?	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	 end 	 ed 	 	up	coming	with	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	 neo 	 nurture 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.	``
from	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	normal	little	thing	you	'd	find	in	a	modern	,	western	hospital	.
in	the	 in 	 side 	 	,	it	's	all	car	 part 	 s 	 	.
it	's	got	a	fan	,	it	's	got	 head 	 light 	 s 	 	for	 warm 	 th 	 	,	it	's	got	door	 chime 	 s 	 	for	alarm	--	it	 run 	 s 	 	off	a	car	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
and	so	all	you	need	is	the	spare	 part 	 s 	 	from	your	toyota	and	the	ability	to	fix	a	 head 	 light 	 	,	and	you	can	repair	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
now	,	that	's	a	great	idea	,	but	what	i	'd	like	to	say	is	that	,	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	metaphor	for	the	way	that	 idea 	 s 	 	happen	.
we	like	to	think	our	 break 	 through 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	are	like	that	$	40,000	,	brand	new	 incub 	 ator 	 	,	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	technology	,	but	more	often	than	not	,	they	're	 cobble 	 d 	 	together	from	 what 	 ever 	 	 part 	 s 	 	that	happen	to	be	around	 near 	 by 	 	.
we	take	 idea 	 s 	 	from	other	people	,	from	people	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	,	from	people	we	run	 in 	 to 	 	in	the	coffee	shop	,	and	we	stitch	them	together	 in 	 to 	 	new	 form 	 s 	 	and	we	create	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	where	 innov 	 ation 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	change	some	of	our	 model 	 s 	 	of	what	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	deep	 think 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	right	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	vision	of	it	.
 an 	 other 	 	is	newton	and	the	apple	,	when	newton	was	at	cambridge	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	statue	from	oxford	.
you	know	,	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 think 	 ing 	 	a	deep	thought	,	and	the	apple	 fall 	 s 	 	from	the	tree	,	and	you	have	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	 space 	 s 	 	that	have	 historic 	 ally 	 	led	to	 innov 	 ation 	 	tend	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	hogarth	's	famous	 paint 	 ing 	 	of	a	kind	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	at	a	tavern	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	coffee	 shop 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	back	then	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	chaotic	environment	where	 idea 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	come	together	,	where	people	 we 	 re 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	new	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	 collision 	 s 	 	--	people	from	different	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	.
so	,	if	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	are	more	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	we	have	to	build	 space 	 s 	 	that	--	 strange 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	--	look	a	little	bit	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	your	 off 	 ice 	 	should	look	like	,	is	part	of	my	 mess 	 age 	 	here	.
and	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	people	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	when	you	research	 th 	 is 	 	field	--	people	are	 notorious 	 ly 	 	 un 	 reli 	 able 	 	,	when	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	self	-	report	on	where	they	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	good	 idea 	 s 	 	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	best	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 research 	 er 	 	named	kevin	dunbar	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	around	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	do	the	big	brother	approach	to	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	where	good	 idea 	 s 	 	come	from	.
he	went	to	a	bunch	of	science	 lab 	 s 	 	around	the	world	and	 video 	 taped 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	every	little	bit	of	 the 	 ir 	 	job	.
so	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 col 	 league 	 	at	the	water	 cool 	 er 	 	,	and	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 record 	 ed 	 	all	of	these	 conversation 	 s 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	where	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	where	they	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	when	we	think	about	the	classic	image	of	the	scientist	in	the	lab	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	image	--	you	know	,	they	're	 pour 	 ing 	 	over	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	and	they	see	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	tissue	 s 	 ample 	 	.
and	``	oh	,	eureka	,	``	they	've	got	the	idea	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	when	dunbar	kind	of	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	tape	is	that	,	in	fact	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	the	 import 	 ant 	 	 break 	 through 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	did	not	happen	 al 	 one 	 	in	the	lab	,	in	front	of	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
they	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	the	 con 	 ference 	 	table	at	the	 week 	 ly 	 	lab	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	when	 every 	 body 	 	got	together	and	 share 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	kind	of	 lat 	 est 	 	data	and	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 often 	 time 	 s 	 	when	people	 share 	 d 	 	the	 mistak 	 es 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	the	error	,	the	noise	in	the	signal	they	 we 	 re 	 	 discover 	 ing 	 	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	environment	--	and	i	've	 start 	 ed 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	it	the	``	liquid	network	,	``	where	you	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	together	,	different	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	,	different	 interest 	 s 	 	,	 jo 	 st 	 ling 	 	with	each	other	,	 bounc 	 ing 	 	off	each	other	--	that	environment	is	,	in	fact	,	the	environment	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
the	other	problem	that	people	have	is	they	like	to	 condens 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	down	to	kind	of	 short 	 er 	 	time	 frame 	 s 	 	.
so	they	want	to	tell	the	story	of	the	``	eureka	!	``	moment	.
they	want	to	say	,	``	there	i	was	,	i	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	and	i	had	it	all	 sudden 	 ly 	 	clear	in	my	head	.	``
but	in	fact	,	if	you	go	back	and	look	at	the	 historic 	 al 	 	record	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	a	lot	of	 import 	 ant 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	have	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 incub 	 ation 	 	 period 	 s 	 	--	i	call	 th 	 is 	 	the	``	 s 	 low 	 	hunch	.	``
we	've	heard	a	lot	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	about	hunch	and	instinct	and	blink	-	like	sudden	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 clar 	 ity 	 	,	but	in	fact	,	a	lot	of	great	 idea 	 s 	 	linger	on	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	for	 decade 	 s 	 	,	in	the	back	of	people	's	 mind 	 s 	 	.
they	have	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	there	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	problem	,	but	they	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	have	the	 tool 	 s 	 	yet	to	discover	them	.
they	 s 	 pend 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	time	 work 	 ing 	 	on	certain	 problem 	 s 	 	,	but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	 linger 	 ing 	 	there	that	they	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	but	they	ca	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	solve	.

and	what	gruber	found	was	that	darwin	had	the	full	 theor 	 y 	 	of	natural	 s 	 election 	 	for	 month 	 s 	 	and	 month 	 s 	 	and	 month 	 s 	 	before	he	had	his	 alle 	 ged 	 	 epiph 	 any 	 	,	 read 	 ing 	 	malthus	in	october	of	1838	.
there	are	 pass 	 age 	 s 	 	where	you	can	read	it	,	and	you	think	you	're	 read 	 ing 	 	from	a	darwin	 text 	 book 	 	,	from	the	period	before	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 epiph 	 any 	 	.
and	so	what	you	 real 	 ize 	 	is	that	darwin	,	in	a	sense	,	had	the	idea	,	he	had	the	 con 	 cept 	 	,	but	was	 un 	 able 	 	of	fully	 think 	 ing 	 	it	yet	.
and	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	how	great	 idea 	 s 	 	often	happen	;	they	 fad 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	view	over	long	 period 	 s 	 	of	time	.
now	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	all	of	us	is	:	how	do	you	create	 environment 	 s 	 	that	allow	these	 idea 	 s 	 	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	long	half	-	life	,	right	?
it	's	hard	to	go	to	your	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	i	have	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	idea	for	our	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
it	will	be	 use 	 ful 	 	in	2020	.
could	you	just	give	me	some	time	to	do	that	?	``
now	a	couple	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	--	like	google	--	they	have	 innov 	 ation 	 	time	off	,	20	percent	time	,	where	,	in	a	sense	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	hunch	-	 cultiv 	 ating 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	in	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
but	that	's	a	key	thing	.
and	the	other	thing	is	to	allow	 t 	 hose 	 	 hunch 	 es 	 	to	connect	with	other	people	's	 hunch 	 es 	 	;	that	's	what	often	 happen 	 s 	 	.
you	have	half	of	an	idea	,	 some 	 body 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	the	other	half	,	and	if	you	're	in	the	right	environment	,	they	turn	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 large 	 r 	 	than	the	sum	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
so	,	in	a	sense	,	we	often	talk	about	the	value	of	 protect 	 ing 	 	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	you	know	,	building	 barricad 	 es 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 secret 	 ive 	 	r	&	d	 lab 	 s 	 	,	 patent 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	have	,	so	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	will	remain	 valu 	 able 	 	,	and	people	will	be	 incentivize 	 d 	 	to	come	up	with	more	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	the	culture	will	be	more	 innov 	 ative 	 	.
but	i	think	there	's	a	case	to	be	made	that	we	should	 s 	 pend 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	time	,	if	not	more	,	 valu 	 ing 	 	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	of	 connect 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	and	not	just	 protect 	 ing 	 	them	.
and	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	which	i	think	 capture 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	these	 value 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	just	 wonder 	 ful 	 	kind	of	tale	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	how	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	ways	.
it	's	october	of	1957	,	and	sputnik	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 launch 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	're	in	laurel	maryland	,	at	the	 appli 	 ed 	 	physics	lab	 associate 	 d 	 	with	johns	hopkins	university	.
and	it	's	monday	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	news	 ha 	 s 	 	just	broken	about	 th 	 is 	 	satellite	that	's	now	 orbit 	 ing 	 	the	planet	.
and	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	nerd	heaven	,	right	?
there	are	all	these	physics	 geek 	 s 	 	who	are	there	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	my	 go 	 sh 	 	!	 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.	i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	two	of	them	,	two	20	-	 some 	 thing 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	at	the	apl	are	there	at	the	cafeteria	table	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	 inform 	 al 	 	conversation	with	a	bunch	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
and	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	are	named	guier	and	weiffenbach	.
and	they	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	and	one	of	them	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 any 	 body 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	listen	for	 th 	 is 	 	thing	?
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	,	man	-	made	satellite	up	there	in	 out 	 er 	 	space	that	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	some	kind	of	signal	.
we	could	 prob 	 ably 	 	hear	it	,	if	we	tune	in	.	``
and	so	they	ask	around	to	a	couple	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	's	like	,	``	no	,	i	had	n't	thought	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
that	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	idea	.	``
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	weiffenbach	is	kind	of	an	expert	in	 micro 	 wave 	 	 re 	 ception 	 	,	and	he	's	got	a	little	 antenna 	 e 	 	set	up	with	an	 ampl 	 ifier 	 	in	his	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	so	guier	and	weiffenbach	go	back	to	weiffenbach	's	 off 	 ice 	 	,	and	they	start	kind	of	 noodl 	 ing 	 	around	--	 hack 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	might	call	it	now	.
and	after	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	the	signal	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	soviets	made	sputnik	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	track	.
it	was	right	at	20	mhz	,	so	you	could	pick	it	up	 re 	 ally 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	that	people	would	think	it	was	a	hoax	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
so	they	made	it	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	to	find	it	.
so	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	signal	,	and	people	start	kind	of	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.	can	i	hear	?	 w 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	great	.	``
and	before	long	,	they	think	,	``	well	jeez	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	historic	.
we	may	be	the	first	people	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	to	be	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	should	record	it	.	``
and	so	they	 br 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	big	,	 clunk 	 y 	 	analog	tape	 record 	 er 	 	and	they	start	 record 	 ing 	 	these	little	bleep	,	 bleep 	 s 	 	.
and	they	start	writing	the	kind	of	date	stamp	,	time	 stamp 	 s 	 	for	each	little	bleep	that	they	record	.
and	they	they	start	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	 go 	 sh 	 	,	you	know	,	we	're	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	small	little	frequency	 vari 	 ations 	 	here	.
we	could	 prob 	 ably 	 	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	speed	that	the	satellite	is	 travel 	 ing 	 	,	if	we	do	a	little	 bas 	 ic 	 	math	here	using	the	doppler	effect	.	``
and	then	they	 play 	 ed 	 	around	with	it	a	little	bit	more	,	and	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	a	couple	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	who	had	other	kind	of	 special 	 ties 	 	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	jeez	,	you	know	,	we	think	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	a	look	at	the	 slop 	 e 	 	of	the	doppler	effect	to	figure	out	the	 point 	 s 	 	at	which	the	satellite	is	 close 	 st 	 	to	our	 antenna 	 e 	 	and	the	 point 	 s 	 	at	which	it	's	 far 	 th 	 est 	 	away	.
that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.	``
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	they	get	 per 	 mission 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	a	little	side	project	that	had	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 official 	 ly 	 	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	job	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	.
they	get	 per 	 mission 	 	to	use	the	new	,	you	know	,	univac	computer	that	 take 	 s 	 	up	an	entire	room	that	they	'd	just	gotten	at	the	apl	.
they	run	some	more	of	the	 number 	 s 	 	,	and	at	the	end	of	about	three	or	four	 week 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 s 	 	out	they	have	 ma 	 pped 	 	the	exact	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	satellite	around	the	earth	,	just	from	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	one	little	signal	,	going	off	on	 th 	 is 	 	little	side	hunch	that	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	inspired	to	do	over	lunch	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
a	couple	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	,	frank	mcclure	,	 pull 	 s 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	,	i	have	to	ask	you	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	project	you	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.
you	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	an	 un 	 known 	 	location	of	a	satellite	 orbit 	 ing 	 	the	planet	from	a	known	location	on	the	ground	.
could	you	go	the	other	way	?
could	you	figure	out	an	 un 	 known 	 	location	on	the	ground	,	if	you	 k 	 new 	 	the	location	of	the	satellite	?	``
and	they	thought	about	it	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	guess	 may 	 be 	 	you	could	.	let	's	run	the	 number 	 s 	 	here	.	``
so	they	went	back	,	and	they	thought	about	it	.
and	they	came	back	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	'll	be	 eas 	 ier 	 	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	that	's	great	.
 be 	 cause 	 	see	,	i	have	these	new	nuclear	 sub 	 marine 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	building	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	figure	out	how	to	get	your	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	so	that	it	will	land	right	on	top	of	moscow	,	if	you	do	n't	know	where	the	 sub 	 marine 	 	is	in	the	middle	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	ocean	.
so	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	we	could	throw	up	a	bunch	of	 satellite 	 s 	 	and	use	it	to	track	our	 sub 	 marine 	 s 	 	and	figure	out	 the 	 ir 	 	location	in	the	middle	of	the	ocean	.
could	you	work	on	that	problem	?	``
and	that	's	how	gps	was	born	.
30	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	ronald	reagan	 actual 	 ly 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	it	up	and	made	it	an	open	platform	that	 any 	 body 	 	could	kind	of	build	 up 	 on 	 	and	 any 	 body 	 	could	come	 a 	 long 	 	and	build	new	technology	that	would	create	and	 innov 	 ate 	 	on	top	of	 th 	 is 	 	open	platform	,	left	it	open	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	do	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 any 	 thing 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	with	it	.
and	now	,	i	guarantee	you	 certain 	 ly 	 	half	of	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	if	not	more	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 de 	 vice 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	pocket	right	now	that	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	one	of	these	 satellite 	 s 	 	in	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
and	i	bet	you	one	of	you	,	if	not	more	,	 ha 	 s 	 	used	 s 	 aid 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	satellite	system	to	locate	a	 near 	 by 	 	 coffee 	 house 	 	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	last	--	in	the	last	day	or	last	week	,	right	?
and	that	,	i	think	,	is	a	great	case	 stud 	 y 	 	,	a	great	 less 	 on 	 	in	the	power	,	the	 marvel 	 ous 	 	,	kind	of	 un 	 plan 	 ned 	 	 emerge 	 nt 	 	,	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	power	of	open	 innov 	 ative 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
