i	am	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 secret 	 s 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	best	way	to	 div 	 ul 	 ge 	 	a	secret	is	to	tell	 some 	 one 	 	to	not	say	 any 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
 secret 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	using	powerpoint	 th 	 is 	 	year	just	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	i	'm	 in 	 to 	 	the	ted	thing	.
and	when	you	use	these	 thing 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	have	to	go	like	that	.
you	just	press	it	.
oh	,	man	.	um	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	.	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	!	just	change	it	!
is	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	here	?
change	it	!	come	on	!	what	?
ah	!	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
that	's	not	my	 slide 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	these	are	all	 map 	 s 	 	.
and	 map 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	for	 transfer 	 ring 	 	information	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	have	human	cognitive	ability	.
we	can	see	that	all	 formula 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 map 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	make	 map 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	that	we	seldom	even	go	,	which	 seem 	 s 	 	a	little	 waste 	 ful 	 	of	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	is	a	map	of	the	moon	.
there	're	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 de 	 light 	 ful 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
tranquilacalitis	,	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	is	frigoris	.
what	are	these	people	 think 	 ing 	 	?	frigoris	?
what	the	frigoris	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	 name 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	.
frigoris	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	moon	.	people	could	live	there	one	day	.
i	'll	meet	you	at	frigoris	.	no	.	i	do	n't	think	so	.
there	we	see	mars	,	 aga 	 in 	 	with	 vari 	 ous 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 d 	 one 	 	,	by	the	way	,	by	the	 inter 	 national 	 	astronomical	 un 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	actual	group	of	people	that	 s 	 it 	 	around	 na 	 ming 	 	planetary	 object 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	 the 	 ir 	 	actual	book	.
these	are	some	of	the	 name 	 s 	 	that	they	have	 chose 	 n 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
i	'll	go	through	a	little	of	them	.	bolotnitsa	.
that	,	of	course	,	is	the	slavic	swamp	 mer 	 maid 	 	.
now	i	think	the	whole	 con 	 cept 	 	of	a	 mer 	 maid 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	blend	 in 	 to 	 	the	swamp	feel	.
``	oh	look	!	 mer 	 maid 	 	come	out	of	swamp	.	oh	boy	!
it	's	time	for	bolotnitsa	!	``
djabran	 fluctu 	 s 	 	.
if	that	do	n't	flow	off	the	tongue	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	?
i	mean	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	and	they	've	got	the	word	``	 fluctu 	 s 	 	``	up	there	.	that	's	wrong	.
one	 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	kid	and	he	could	be	 ruin 	 ing 	 	his	life	.
``	it	 fluctu 	 s 	 	up	,	mama	.	``
hikuleo	 fluctu 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	little	more	 flow 	 ing 	 	.	hikuleo	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	kind	of	a	leonardo	dicaprio	17	syllable	thing	.
and	that	's	the	tonga	 under 	 world 	 	.
and	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	is	the	itoki	 fluctu 	 s 	 	,	who	is	the	nicaraguan	goddess	of	 insect 	 s 	 	,	 star 	 s 	 	,	and	 planet 	 s 	 	.
now	,	if	you	're	a	goddess	of	 star 	 s 	 	and	 planet 	 s 	 	would	n't	you	relegate	 insect 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	else	?
``	no	,	no	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	i	'm	so	 bus 	 y 	 	with	the	 star 	 s 	 	.
would	you	mind	taking	the	 insect 	 s 	 	?	thank	you	 darl 	 ing 	 	.
oh	take	the	 spider 	 s 	 	too	.	i	know	they	're	not	 insect 	 s 	 	,	but	i	do	n't	care	.
 monkey 	 s 	 	,	 chimp 	 s 	 	,	just	get	rid	of	the	 hair 	 y 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.	``
now	,	we	're	going	to	be	going	to	mars	one	day	.	and	when	we	do	,	it	's	going	to	be	 un 	 fair 	 	for	the	people	that	are	living	there	to	have	to	live	with	these	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	'll	be	on	mars	,	and	you	're	at	hellespointica	depressio	which	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	a	 re 	 ally 	 	``	up	``	place	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'm	at	the	depressio	,	and	i	want	to	get	over	to	amazonis	so	i	plug	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	mars	map	,	and	click	the	button	and	there	's	my	 direction 	 s 	 	.
i	go	to	chrysokeras	.
left	to	the	thymiamata	.
then	to	niliacus	lacus	,	which	is	not	a	bad	name	.
niliacus	lacus	,	try	to	get	the	practice	,	 s 	 lick 	 	-	a	-	tick	-	a	-	bacus	.
that	's	a	cool	name	.	i	will	say	that	.
so	,	i	hold	back	a	little	of	my	venom	for	these	astronomical	 misnomer 	 s 	 	.
and	then	of	course	arnon	to	thoth	.
and	of	course	there	will	be	 advertise 	 ments 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	 the 	 ir 	 	rule	book	,	the	 inter 	 national 	 	astronomical	 un 	 ion 	 	.
and	you	know	they	're	 inter 	 national 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	put	it	``	en	francais	``	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
l'union	astronomique	internationale	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	speak	french	.
i	thought	i	'd	 transl 	 ate 	 	for	you	.
from	the	 rule 	 book 	 	:	nomenclature	is	a	tool	.
the	first	 consider 	 ation 	 	,	make	it	clear	,	simple	and	 un 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	.
and	i	think	that	djabran	 fluctu 	 s 	 	,	that	 fit 	 s 	 	that	mode	.
that	's	simple	,	the	goddess	of	 goat 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.

``	now	,	frank	is	 th 	 is 	 	clear	to	you	,	djabran	 fluctu 	 s 	 	?	``
``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	the	goat	goddess	right	?	the	abacazanian	?
it	's	clear	to	me	.	``
``	listen	,	i	'm	going	back	to	the	swamp	 mer 	 maid 	 	.	can	you	call	me	in	a	little	while	?	``
 al 	 so 	 	,	from	the	actual	document	i	 high 	 light 	 ed 	 	a	part	i	thought	may	be	of	interest	.
 any 	 one 	 	can	suggest	changing	a	name	.
so	,	i	look	to	you	,	fellow	member	of	the	earth	community	.
we	've	got	to	change	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	up	fast	.
so	,	these	are	actual	 name 	 s 	 	of	people	that	work	there	.
i	did	some	more	investigation	.
these	are	more	people	 work 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	group	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	they	do	n't	use	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 name 	 s 	 	.
these	are	people	 na 	 ming 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	and	they	wo	n't	use	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 name 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 kew 	 	here	.
is	it	 be 	 cause 	 	his	name	is	 re 	 ally 	 	jupiter	blunck	?
is	that	ganymede	andromeda	burba	?
is	that	mars	ya	marov	?
i	do	n't	know	.	but	it	's	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	material	,	no	doubt	.
there	are	some	mapping	people	who	do	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
witness	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	eugene	shoemaker	,	who	,	 diligent 	 ly 	 	,	from	a	young	boy	 decide 	 d 	 	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	 map 	 s 	 	of	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	bodies	.

``	mom	,	i	want	to	make	 map 	 s 	 	.	``
``	that	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	eugene	.	you	could	make	 map 	 s 	 	of	toronto	.	``
``	no	,	i	want	to	make	 map 	 s 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	.	``
``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	go	to	your	room	.	``
martians	,	venusians	,	jovians	.
we	have	 name 	 s 	 	for	 place 	 s 	 	where	people	do	n't	exist	.
that	 seem 	 s 	 	a	little	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	to	me	.
there	are	no	jovians	.
 get 	 ting 	 	back	to	my	 pre 	 mise 	 	,	i	used	 stamp 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	have	to	pay	 any 	 body 	 	for	the	 right 	 s 	 	.
there	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	einstein	,	niels	bohr	,	de	fermat	's	last	 theor 	 em 	 	,	and	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	that	's	james	coburn	or	richard	harris	.
it	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	two	.	i	'm	not	 re 	 ally 	 	clear	which	one	.
but	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	point	is	that	 number 	 s 	 	are	 map 	 s 	 	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	 number 	 s 	 	,	is	there	an	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	secret	to	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	?
that	is	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.
by	the	way	,	that	's	a	natural	picture	of	saturn	,	no	 adjust 	 ments 	 	.	i	mean	that	's	just	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	that	i	will	even	give	up	a	laugh	to	explain	my	love	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	planet	,	and	the	day	saturday	,	named	after	it	,	 wonder 	 fully 	 	.
so	,	 formula 	 s 	 	 re 	 late 	 	number	to	form	.
that	's	euler	,	his	formula	was	one	of	the	 inspiration 	 s 	 	that	lead	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	string	 theor 	 y 	 	which	is	kind	of	cool	,	not	that	funny	,	but	it	is	cool	.
he	was	 al 	 so 	 	famous	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	no	body	.
which	a	lot	of	you	are	like	,	``	how	did	he	figure	that	out	?	``
he	's	got	no	body	,	no	man	,	just	a	head	 float 	 ing 	 	high	.
here	 come 	 s 	 	euler	.
and	that	's	an	icosahedron	,	which	is	one	of	the	five	sacred	 solid 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	.
you	see	the	icosahedron	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	dodecahedron	,	it	's	dual	.
there	is	a	dodecahedron	which	i	had	to	do	in	my	room	last	night	.
the	five	sacred	 solid 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	there	.
which	is	not	to	be	 con 	 fused 	 	with	the	five	sacred	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 s 	 	.
blue	cheese	,	ranch	,	oil	and	 vine 	 gar 	 	,	thousand	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	and	house	.
i	suggest	the	house	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	,	now	here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	these	 shape 	 s 	 	are	 dual 	 s 	 	of	each	other	.
and	you	can	see	how	the	icosahedron	 withdraw 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	dodecahedron	and	then	they	just	merge	 in 	 to 	 	each	other	.
so	,	the	whole	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 bran 	 es 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	if	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	shaped	like	a	dodecahedron	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	map	of	what	could	possibly	be	.
and	that	is	,	of	course	,	what	we	are	here	to	talk	about	.
what	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	!
october	9th	,	in	france	,	jean	-	pierre	luminet	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	shaped	like	a	dodecahedron	,	based	on	information	that	they	got	from	 th 	 is 	 	 prob 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	normal	wave	pattern	.
but	what	they	're	 see 	 ing 	 	,	way	out	there	in	the	far	 reach 	 es 	 	of	the	 micro 	 wave 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	odd	 undul 	 ation 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	plug	in	to	what	they	 suspect 	 ed 	 	a	flat	 uni 	 verse 	 	would	be	.
so	,	you	can	kind	of	get	an	idea	from	 th 	 is 	 	 extrapol 	 ating 	 	that	back	under	 th 	 is 	 	huge	picture	,	so	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	what	the	 prim 	 al 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
and	 judg 	 ing 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	a	little	like	a	 cheese 	 burger 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	either	a	dodecahedron	or	a	 cheese 	 burger 	 	.
and	for	me	,	that	's	a	win	-	win	.
 every 	 body 	 	 go 	 es 	 	,	i	'm	happy	.
better	 re 	 ally 	 	 hur 	 ry 	 	up	.
i	just	threw	 th 	 is 	 	in	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	all	of	our	intellectual	abilities	are	,	 with 	 out 	 	heart	and	 with 	 out 	 	love	it	's	just	--	it	's	all	 meaning 	 less 	 	.
and	that	,	to	me	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	for	that	 creep 	 y 	 	guy	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
 get 	 ting 	 	back	to	the	point	of	my	 part 	 icular 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	,	kepler	,	one	of	my	great	heroes	,	who	 real 	 ized 	 	that	these	five	 solid 	 s 	 	,	which	i	spoke	of	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	related	 some 	 how 	 	to	the	 planet 	 s 	 	,	but	he	could	n't	prove	it	.	it	 freak 	 ed 	 	him	out	.
but	it	did	lead	to	newton	 discover 	 ing 	 	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
so	,	 map 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	 organize 	 d 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	in	which	we	emerge	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	isaac	from	a	vietnamese	stamp	.
i	am	not	 suggest 	 ing 	 	at	all	that	my	vietnamese	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	could	 may 	 be 	 	use	a	little	art	class	here	and	there	.	but	...
that	's	not	a	good	picture	.
not	a	good	picture	.	now	,	my	 friend 	 s 	 	in	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	nevis	are	a	little	better	.	look	at	that	!	that	's	isaac	newton	.
that	guy	is	 rock 	 in 	 	'	.
what	a	 hand 	 some 	 	cat	.
once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	nicaragua	let	me	down	.
and	copernicus	 look 	 s 	 	like	johnny	carson	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	.
i	do	n't	get	that	at	all	.
once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	rock	it	out	.
isaac	is	 kick 	 in 	 	'	ass	.	man	,	he	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	rock	star	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 freak 	 y 	 	is	a	major	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	sierra	leone	.
they	got	little	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	there	,	 float 	 ing 	 	in	there	.
man	.	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	comment	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	i	did	n't	know	that	isaac	newton	was	in	the	moody	 blue 	 s 	 	.	did	you	?
when	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
it	's	a	different	kind	of	course	.	and	they	've	got	five	 apple 	 s 	 	?
i	mean	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 extrapol 	 ating 	 	in	 realm 	 s 	 	that	are	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	valid	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	five	is	a	good	number	,	of	course	.
ecuador	,	my	friend	kepler	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	they	call	him	juan	.

there	we	can	see	fibonacci	 number 	 s 	 	related	to	the	 gold 	 en 	 	section	,	 be 	 cause 	 	fibonacci	and	 gold 	 en 	 	section	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	of	the	 measur 	 ed 	 	meter	of	matter	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	refer	to	it	.
if	fibonacci	had	 be 	 en 	 	on	paxil	,	that	would	be	the	fibonacci	 s 	 eries 	 	.
``	ten	 milli 	 gram 	 	,	20	 milli 	 gram 	 	.	``
``	leonardo	,	 d 	 inner 	 	's	ready	,	put	down	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	and	take	your	 pill 	 s 	 	.	``
``	 y 	 es 	 	,	mama	.	``
 al 	 right 	 	where	is	 th 	 is 	 	going	?	that	's	a	good	question	.
here	is	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	that	i	 beg 	 an 	 	27	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
if	 number 	 s 	 	can	express	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	we	live	,	i	reason	,	through	some	sort	of	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	we	could	 extrapol 	 ate 	 	from	them	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	structural	element	of	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	that	's	what	i	did	.	twenty	-	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	build	a	particle	 accele 	 rator 	 	.
and	that	did	n't	work	out	well	.
so	,	then	i	thought	a	 calcul 	 ator 	 	is	a	metaphor	.
i	can	just	divide	 number 	 s 	 	,	that	's	like	atom	 s 	 mash 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	what	i	did	.	that	's	how	i	found	moleeds	.
moleeds	are	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	the	thing	that	will	allow	string	 theor 	 y 	 	to	be	 prov 	 ed 	 	.
they	are	the	 nod 	 es 	 	on	the	string	,	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	27	,	37	.
that	was	the	first	chart	i	came	up	with	.
you	can	see	,	even	if	you	do	n't	go	for	the	 number 	 s 	 	,	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	the	symmetry	.
the	 number 	 s 	 	from	one	to	36	,	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	six	 group 	 s 	 	.
symmetry	,	 pair 	 s 	 	.
every	top	 add 	 s 	 	up	to	37	.
bottom	,	all	74	.
there	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	 intric 	 ate 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	not	going	to	go	there	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	would	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	go	back	to	the	 fluctu 	 s 	 	part	.	``
circle	of	fifths	,	acoustic	 harmon 	 y 	 	,	 geo 	 metric 	 	symmetry	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 we 	 re 	 	related	.
once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	cartesian	kind	of	cross	-	over	.
so	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	if	i	'm	going	to	put	a	circle	,	see	what	kind	of	 pattern 	 s 	 	i	get	,	boom	,	the	red	system	.
look	at	that	.	you	ca	n't	just	make	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	up	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
you	ca	n't	just	go	around	going	,	``	oh	,	i	'm	going	to	put	some	 triangle 	 s 	 	in	a	circle	and	they	're	going	to	be	 symmetric 	 al 	 	.	and	they	're	all	going	to	add	up	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	,	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	that	out	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	beyond	 any 	 thing 	 	 any 	 body 	 	could	just	make	up	.
there	is	the	 o 	 range 	 	system	.
and	you	'll	see	over	here	,	these	are	 multi 	 ple 	 s 	 	of	the	number	27	.
and	they	recapitulate	that	shape	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	that	's	a	circle	of	nine	and	that	's	a	circle	of	36.	it	's	nuts	.
that	's	the	green	system	.	it	all	 fold 	 s 	 	in	half	on	the	green	system	,	right	between	18	and	19	.
the	blue	system	.	the	violet	.	it	's	all	there	.
look	at	that	!	i	mean	you	can	not	make	that	stuff	up	.
that	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	fall	out	of	a	tree	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
twenty	-	seven	 year 	 s 	 	of	my	life	!
and	i	'm	 present 	 ing 	 	it	here	at	ted	.	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	place	if	 alien 	 s 	 	land	,	i	hope	they	come	here	.
``	we	are	going	to	destroy	the	earth	.	 h 	 mmm 	 	...	 may 	 be 	 	not	.	``
in	 th 	 is 	 	last	year	i	have	found	these	 sub 	 sequent 	 	 system 	 s 	 	which	allow	for	the	mathematic	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	the	calabi	-	yau	 mani 	 fold 	 s 	 	in	a	way	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 necess 	 itate 	 	these	little	 hid 	 den 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
which	 work 	 s 	 	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	,	but	it	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	god	-	like	to	me	.
it	just	 seem 	 s 	 	like	it	's	not	sexy	and	elegant	,	it	's	 hid 	 den 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	 hid 	 den 	 	,	i	want	to	see	it	.
i	found	other	 pair 	 s 	 	all	have	symmetry	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 un 	 like 	 	the	master	one	,	 the 	 ir 	 	symmetry	is	split	.
 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	crazy	.
am	i	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	that	 s 	 ees 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
you	know	,	i	did	n't	just	draw	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	day	,	by	the	way	.
you	know	,	try	making	some	 chart 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	at	home	.
you	got	ta	be	accurate	!	there	's	 measure 	 ment 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	,	 increment 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 map 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	.
not	 stamp 	 s 	 	,	but	one	day	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	punch	.	 gold 	 en 	 	ratio	,	it	's	crazy	.
and	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	built	 with 	 in 	 	it	is	the	 gold 	 en 	 	ratio	.
i	start	looking	at	that	,	and	look	at	them	 aga 	 in 	 	.
they	start	looking	like	 planet 	 s 	 	.
i	go	to	jpl	.
i	look	at	the	 orbit 	 s 	 	of	the	 planet 	 s 	 	.
i	find	18	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	it	in	our	solar	system	.
i	never	told	 any 	 body 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	thing	.	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
kepler	was	right	.
eighteen	and	19	,	the	middle	of	the	moleeds	,	0.618	is	the	 gold 	 en 	 	section	.
 multi 	 ply 	 	them	together	,	18.618	x	19.618	is	365.247	.
which	is	.005	different	from	the	number	of	 day 	 s 	 	in	a	year	.
 he 	 y 	 	,	you	ca	n't	make	 th 	 is 	 	up	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
