what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 genomic 	 s 	 	,	and	how	 th 	 is 	 	revolution	is	about	to	change	 every 	 thing 	 	we	know	about	the	world	,	life	,	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	how	we	think	about	them	.
if	you	saw	2001	:	a	space	odyssey	,	and	you	heard	the	boom	,	boom	,	boom	,	boom	,	and	you	saw	the	monolith	,	you	know	,	that	was	arthur	c.	clarke	's	 represent 	 ation 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	a	 semi 	 nal 	 	moment	in	the	evolution	of	our	species	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	it	was	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	 bone 	 s 	 	and	creating	a	tool	,	using	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	tool	,	which	 me 	 ant 	 	that	 ape 	 s 	 	just	,	sort	of	,	running	around	and	eating	and	 do 	 ing 	 	each	other	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	they	can	make	 thing 	 s 	 	if	they	used	a	tool	.
and	that	 move 	 d 	 	us	to	the	next	level	.
and	,	you	know	,	we	in	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	have	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 accele 	 ration 	 	in	knowledge	and	technology	,	and	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 br 	 ed 	 	more	knowledge	and	 give 	 n 	 	us	 tool 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 semi 	 nal 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	creation	of	small	 computer 	 s 	 	in	the	'70s	and	early	'80s	,	and	who	would	have	thought	back	then	that	every	single	person	would	not	have	just	one	computer	but	 prob 	 ably 	 	20	,	in	your	home	,	and	in	not	just	your	p.c	.	but	in	every	 de 	 vice 	 	--	in	your	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	,	your	cell	phone	.
you	're	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	;	your	car	 ha 	 s 	 	12	 micro 	 processor 	 s 	 	.
then	we	go	 a 	 long 	 	and	create	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	connect	the	world	together	;	we	flatten	the	world	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	so	much	change	,	and	we	've	 give 	 n 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	these	 tool 	 s 	 	now	--	these	high	-	powered	 tool 	 s 	 	--	that	are	 allow 	 ing 	 	us	to	turn	the	lens	 in 	 ward 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	common	to	all	of	us	,	and	that	is	a	genome	.
how	's	your	genome	 to 	 day 	 	?	have	you	thought	about	it	 late 	 ly 	 	?
heard	about	it	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	?	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	hear	about	 genome 	 s 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
i	thought	i	'd	take	a	moment	to	tell	you	what	a	genome	is	.
it	's	,	sort	of	,	like	if	you	ask	people	,	well	,	what	is	a	 mega 	 byte 	 	or	 mega 	 bit 	 	?	and	what	is	 broad 	 band 	 	?
people	never	want	to	say	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	understand	.
so	,	i	will	tell	you	right	off	of	the	bat	.
you	've	heard	of	dna	;	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	a	little	bit	in	biology	.
a	genome	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	for	all	of	the	dna	that	is	in	a	living	organism	.
and	one	thing	that	is	common	to	all	of	life	is	dna	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	a	 y 	 east 	 	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	a	mouse	;	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	a	fly	;	we	all	have	dna	.
the	dna	is	 organize 	 d 	 	in	 word 	 s 	 	,	call	them	:	 gene 	 s 	 	and	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
and	when	watson	and	crick	in	the	'50s	first	 decode 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	that	we	know	 a 	 s 	 	the	dna	molecule	--	 ver 	 y 	 	long	,	 complic 	 ated 	 	molecule	--	we	then	 start 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	journey	to	understand	that	 in 	 side 	 	of	that	dna	is	a	language	that	 determine 	 s 	 	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	,	our	 trait 	 s 	 	,	what	we	inherit	,	what	 disease 	 s 	 	we	may	get	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	molecule	,	that	all	of	the	dna	in	your	body	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	us	,	of	us	 a 	 s 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
there	is	a	 historic 	 al 	 	 archiv 	 e 	 	.
living	in	your	genome	is	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	our	species	,	and	you	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	where	you	're	from	,	going	back	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	now	 start 	 ing 	 	to	be	 under 	 stood 	 	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	genome	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 instruct 	 ion 	 	manual	.
it	is	the	program	.	it	is	the	code	of	life	.
it	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	you	function	;	it	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	every	organism	function	.
dna	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	elegant	molecule	.
it	's	long	and	it	's	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	all	you	have	to	know	about	it	is	that	there	's	four	 letter 	 s 	 	:	a	,	t	,	c	,	g	;	they	represent	the	name	of	a	chemical	.
and	with	these	four	 letter 	 s 	 	,	you	can	create	a	language	:	a	language	that	can	 de 	 scribe 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	they	are	 general 	 ly 	 	put	together	in	 pair 	 s 	 	,	creating	a	word	or	what	we	call	base	 pair 	 s 	 	.
and	you	would	,	you	know	,	when	you	think	about	it	,	four	 letter 	 s 	 	,	or	the	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	four	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 make 	 s 	 	us	work	.
and	that	may	not	sound	 ver 	 y 	 	intuitive	,	but	let	me	flip	over	to	 some 	 thing 	 	else	you	know	about	,	and	that	's	 computer 	 s 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	screen	here	and	,	you	know	,	you	see	 picture 	 s 	 	and	you	see	 word 	 s 	 	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	all	there	are	are	 one 	 s 	 	and	 zero 	 s 	 	.
the	language	of	technology	is	 bin 	 ary 	 	;	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	that	at	some	point	in	time	.
 every 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	in	digital	is	 convert 	 ed 	 	,	or	a	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	of	a	one	and	a	zero	.
so	,	when	you	're	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	itunes	and	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	music	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	just	a	bunch	of	 one 	 s 	 	and	 zero 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
when	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	these	 picture 	 s 	 	,	it	's	all	 one 	 s 	 	and	 zero 	 s 	 	,	and	when	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	on	your	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	your	cell	phone	,	and	it	's	going	over	the	network	,	your	voice	is	all	 be 	 ing 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 one 	 s 	 	and	 zero 	 s 	 	and	 magic 	 ally 	 	 whiz 	 z 	 ed 	 	around	.
and	look	at	all	the	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	create	with	just	a	one	and	a	zero	.
well	,	now	you	ramp	that	up	to	four	,	and	you	have	a	lot	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	a	lot	of	ways	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	.
so	,	let	's	talk	about	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	.
so	,	if	you	look	at	a	human	genome	,	they	consist	of	3.2	billion	of	these	base	 pair 	 s 	 	.	that	's	a	lot	.
and	they	mix	up	in	all	different	 fashion 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	convert	that	to	 bin 	 ary 	 	,	just	to	give	you	a	little	bit	of	 s 	 izing 	 	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	program	 micro 	 soft 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	.
it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	all	that	much	data	.
i	will	 al 	 so 	 	tell	you	we	're	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bug 	 gy 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	here	is	a	bug	in	my	genome	that	i	have	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	for	a	long	,	long	time	.
when	you	get	sick	,	it	is	a	bug	in	your	genome	.
in	fact	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	we	have	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	for	a	long	time	,	like	cancer	,	we	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	cure	 be 	 cause 	 	we	just	do	n't	understand	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	at	the	genomic	level	.
we	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	understand	that	.
so	,	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	fix	it	by	using	what	i	call	shit	-	against	-	the	-	wall	 pharmaco 	 logy 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	well	,	let	's	just	throw	 chemical 	 s 	 	at	it	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	going	to	make	it	work	.
but	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	why	 do 	 es 	 	a	cell	go	from	normal	cell	to	cancer	?
what	is	the	code	?
what	are	the	exact	 instruct 	 ions 	 	that	are	making	it	do	that	?
then	you	can	go	about	the	process	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	fix	it	and	figure	it	out	.
so	,	for	your	next	 d 	 inner 	 	over	a	great	bottle	of	wine	,	here	's	a	few	 fact 	 oid 	 s 	 	for	you	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	about	24,000	 gene 	 s 	 	that	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	have	about	a	hundred	,	120,000	 other 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	appear	to	function	every	day	,	but	represent	 th 	 is 	 	 archiv 	 al 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	how	we	used	to	work	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	going	back	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
you	might	 al 	 so 	 	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 know 	 ing 	 	that	a	mouse	 ha 	 s 	 	about	the	same	amount	of	 gene 	 s 	 	.
they	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 sequence 	 d 	 	 pi 	 not 	 	 no 	 ir 	 	,	and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	about	30,000	 gene 	 s 	 	,	so	the	number	of	 gene 	 s 	 	you	have	may	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	represent	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	or	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	order	of	any	 part 	 icular 	 	species	.
now	,	look	around	:	just	look	next	to	your	neighbor	,	look	forward	,	look	 back 	 ward 	 	.	we	all	look	 pre 	 tty 	 	different	.
a	lot	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 hand 	 some 	 	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	people	here	,	 skin 	 ny 	 	,	 c 	 hub 	 by 	 	,	different	 race 	 s 	 	,	 culture 	 s 	 	.	we	are	all	99.9	%	 genetic 	 ally 	 	equal	.
it	is	one	one	-	 hundred 	 th 	 	of	one	percent	of	genetic	material	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	any	one	of	us	.
that	's	a	 tin 	 y 	 	amount	of	material	,	but	the	way	that	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 express 	 es 	 	 it 	 self 	 	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	and	in	all	species	.
so	,	we	are	now	able	to	read	 genome 	 s 	 	.
the	first	human	genome	took	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	three	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	dr.	craig	venter	.
and	then	james	watson	's	--	one	of	the	co	-	 founder 	 s 	 	of	dna	--	genome	was	 d 	 one 	 	for	two	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	in	just	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	think	about	the	computer	industry	and	how	we	've	gone	from	big	 computer 	 s 	 	to	little	 one 	 s 	 	and	how	they	get	more	 power 	 ful 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	all	the	time	,	the	same	thing	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	gene	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	now	:	we	are	on	the	 cus 	 p 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	sequence	human	 genome 	 s 	 	for	about	5,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	about	an	hour	or	a	half	-	hour	;	you	will	see	that	happen	in	the	next	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	,	you	are	going	to	walk	around	with	your	own	personal	genome	on	a	smart	card	.	it	will	be	here	.
and	when	you	buy	medicine	,	you	wo	n't	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	drug	that	's	used	for	 every 	 body 	 	.
you	will	give	your	genome	to	the	pharmacist	,	and	your	drug	will	be	made	for	you	and	it	will	work	much	better	than	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	--	you	wo	n't	have	side	 effect 	 s 	 	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 oil 	 y 	 	residue	and	,	you	know	,	 what 	 ever 	 	they	say	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 commercial 	 s 	 	:	forget	about	that	.
they	're	going	to	make	all	that	stuff	go	away	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	a	genome	look	like	?
well	,	there	it	is	.	it	is	a	long	,	long	 s 	 eries 	 	of	these	base	 pair 	 s 	 	.
if	you	saw	the	genome	for	a	mouse	or	for	a	human	it	would	look	no	different	than	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	what	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	now	is	they	're	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	these	do	and	what	they	mean	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	nature	is	 do 	 ing 	 	is	double	-	 click 	 ing 	 	all	the	time	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	first	couple	of	 sentence 	 s 	 	here	,	 assum 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	grape	plant	:	make	a	root	,	make	a	branch	,	create	a	blossom	.
in	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	down	in	here	it	could	be	:	make	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	,	start	cancer	.
for	me	it	may	be	:	every	calorie	you	 consum 	 e 	 	,	you	 conserv 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	come	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	climate	.
for	my	wife	:	eat	three	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	and	you	never	put	on	any	weight	.
it	's	all	 hid 	 den 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	code	,	and	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	be	 under 	 stood 	 	at	 break 	 neck 	 	pace	.
so	,	what	can	we	do	with	 genome 	 s 	 	now	that	we	can	read	them	,	now	that	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	have	the	book	of	life	?
well	,	there	's	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	some	are	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
some	people	will	find	 ver 	 y 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	.	i	will	tell	you	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	make	you	want	to	 project 	 ile 	 	 pu 	 ke 	 	on	me	,	but	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	,	you	know	,	we	now	can	learn	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 organism 	 s 	 	.
you	can	do	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	test	:	 scrap 	 e 	 	your	cheek	;	 s 	 end 	 	it	off	.
you	can	find	out	where	your	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	come	from	;	you	can	do	your	 genea 	 logy 	 	going	back	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	can	understand	 functional 	 ity 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
we	can	understand	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	why	we	create	 pla 	 que 	 	in	our	 arteri 	 es 	 	,	what	 create 	 s 	 	the	 starch 	 iness 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	grain	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	 y 	 east 	 	 metabol 	 ize 	 	sugar	and	produce	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	look	at	,	at	a	 grand 	 er 	 	scale	,	what	 create 	 s 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	what	 create 	 s 	 	disease	,	and	how	we	may	be	able	to	fix	them	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	understand	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	can	fix	them	,	make	better	 organism 	 s 	 	.
most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	what	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	that	nature	 ha 	 s 	 	 provide 	 d 	 	us	a	spectacular	 tool 	 box 	 	.
the	 tool 	 box 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	.
an	architect	far	better	and	 smart 	 er 	 	than	us	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	that	 tool 	 box 	 	,	and	we	now	have	the	ability	to	use	it	.
we	are	now	not	just	 read 	 ing 	 	 genome 	 s 	 	;	we	are	writing	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	company	,	synthetic	 genomic 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 involve 	 d 	 	with	,	 create 	 d 	 	the	first	full	synthetic	genome	for	a	little	bug	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	primitive	creature	 call 	 ed 	 	 myco 	 plasma 	 	 genital 	 ium 	 	.
if	you	have	a	uti	,	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	--	or	ever	had	a	uti	--	you	've	come	in	contact	with	 th 	 is 	 	little	bug	.
 ver 	 y 	 	simple	--	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	about	246	 gene 	 s 	 	--	but	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	synthesize	that	genome	.
now	,	you	have	the	genome	and	you	say	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	so	,	if	i	plug	 th 	 is 	 	synthetic	genome	--	if	i	pull	the	old	one	out	and	plug	it	in	--	 do 	 es 	 	it	just	boot	up	and	live	?
well	,	guess	what	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	do	that	;	if	you	took	the	genome	--	that	synthetic	genome	--	and	you	 plug 	 ged 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	different	critter	,	like	 y 	 east 	 	,	you	now	turn	that	 y 	 east 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 myco 	 plasma 	 	.
it	's	,	sort	of	,	like	 boot 	 ing 	 	up	a	pc	with	a	mac	o.s	.	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	could	do	it	the	other	way	.
so	,	you	know	,	by	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	write	a	genome	and	plug	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	organism	,	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	if	you	will	,	 change 	 s 	 	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	.
so	,	last	year	the	french	and	italians	 announce 	 d 	 	they	got	together	and	they	went	 a 	 head 	 	and	they	 sequence 	 d 	 	 pi 	 not 	 	 no 	 ir 	 	.
the	genomic	sequence	now	 exist 	 s 	 	for	the	entire	 pi 	 not 	 	 no 	 ir 	 	organism	,	and	they	identified	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	about	29,000	 gene 	 s 	 	.
they	have	 discover 	 ed 	 	 path 	 ways 	 	that	create	 flavor 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 crank 	 ing 	 	out	have	to	match	a	receptor	in	our	genome	,	in	our	tongue	,	for	us	to	understand	and	interpret	 t 	 hose 	 	 flavor 	 s 	 	.
they	've	 al 	 so 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	there	's	a	heck	of	a	lot	of	activity	going	on	producing	aroma	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
they	've	identified	 area 	 s 	 	of	 vulner 	 ability 	 	to	disease	.
they	now	are	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	work	is	going	on	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	 th 	 is 	 	plant	 work 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	the	 cap 	 ability 	 	to	know	,	to	read	that	entire	code	and	understand	how	it	 tick 	 s 	 	.
so	,	then	what	do	you	do	?
 know 	 ing 	 	that	we	can	read	it	,	 know 	 ing 	 	that	we	can	write	it	,	change	it	,	 may 	 be 	 	write	 it 	 s 	 	genome	from	scratch	.	so	,	what	do	you	do	?
well	,	one	thing	you	could	do	is	what	some	people	might	call	franken	-	 no 	 ir 	 	.
we	can	build	a	better	vine	.
by	the	way	,	just	so	you	know	:	you	get	 stress 	 ed 	 	out	about	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	;	there	is	not	one	single	vine	in	 th 	 is 	 	 val 	 ley 	 	or	 any 	 where 	 	that	is	not	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	.
they	're	not	grown	from	 seed 	 s 	 	;	they	're	 graft 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	root	stock	;	they	would	not	exist	in	nature	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
so	,	do	n't	worry	about	,	do	n't	stress	about	that	stuff	.	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
so	,	we	could	,	you	know	,	focus	on	disease	 resist 	 ance 	 	;	we	can	go	for	 high 	 er 	 	 yield 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	do	it	,	or	 cost 	 s 	 	.
we	could	 conceiv 	 ably 	 	expand	the	climate	window	:	we	could	make	 pi 	 not 	 	 no 	 ir 	 	grow	 may 	 be 	 	in	long	 is 	 land 	 	,	god	forbid	.
we	could	produce	better	 flavor 	 s 	 	and	 aroma 	 s 	 	.
you	want	a	little	more	 ra 	 sp 	 berry 	 	,	a	little	more	chocolate	here	or	there	?
all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	could	 conceiv 	 ably 	 	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	i	will	tell	you	i	'd	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	bet	that	it	will	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
but	there	's	an	 eco 	 system 	 	here	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	're	not	,	sort	of	,	 un 	 ique 	 	little	 organism 	 s 	 	running	around	;	we	are	part	of	a	big	 eco 	 system 	 	.
in	fact	--	i	'm	sorry	to	inform	you	--	that	 in 	 side 	 	of	your	 digest 	 ive 	 	tract	is	about	10	 pound 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	which	you	're	 circul 	 ating 	 	through	your	body	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	.
our	ocean	's	 team 	 ing 	 	with	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	;	in	fact	,	when	craig	venter	went	and	 sequence 	 d 	 	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	,	in	the	first	three	 month 	 s 	 	 triple 	 d 	 	the	known	species	on	the	planet	by	 discover 	 ing 	 	all	-	new	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	in	the	first	20	feet	of	water	.
we	now	understand	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	have	more	impact	on	our	climate	and	 regulat 	 ing 	 	co	2	and	oxygen	than	 plant 	 s 	 	do	,	which	we	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	 oxygen 	 ate 	 	the	atmosphere	.
we	find	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	life	in	every	part	of	the	planet	:	in	ice	,	in	coal	,	in	 rock 	 s 	 	,	in	 volcan 	 ic 	 	 vent 	 s 	 	;	it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	.
but	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 plant 	 s 	 	,	in	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	understand	and	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	understand	 the 	 ir 	 	 genome 	 s 	 	,	it	is	the	 eco 	 system 	 	around	them	,	it	is	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	live	in	 the 	 ir 	 	root	 system 	 s 	 	,	that	have	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	impact	on	the	character	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 metabol 	 ic 	 	 path 	 ways 	 	of	the	 plant 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
if	you	take	a	 close 	 r 	 	look	at	a	root	system	,	you	will	find	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	big	news	to	 vi 	 ti 	 cultur 	 ists 	 	;	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	,	you	know	,	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	water	and	 fertil 	 ization 	 	.
and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	sort	of	,	my	 not 	 ion 	 	of	shit	-	against	-	the	-	wall	 pharmaco 	 logy 	 	:	you	know	certain	 fertil 	 izer 	 s 	 	make	the	plant	more	 health 	 y 	 	so	you	put	more	in	.
you	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	know	with	 granular 	 ity 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 organism 	 s 	 	are	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	what	 flavor 	 s 	 	and	what	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	.
we	can	start	to	figure	that	out	.
we	all	talk	about	 terr 	 oir 	 	;	we	worship	 terr 	 oir 	 	;	we	say	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	is	my	 terr 	 oir 	 	great	!	it	's	so	special	.
i	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	land	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	 terr 	 oir 	 	like	you	would	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	.
well	,	you	know	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	,	we	 argu 	 e 	 	and	debate	about	it	--	we	say	it	's	climate	,	it	's	 s 	 oil 	 	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	.	well	,	guess	what	?
we	can	figure	out	what	the	heck	 terr 	 oir 	 	is	.
it	's	in	there	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	be	 sequence 	 d 	 	.
there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	there	.
they	're	easy	to	sequence	:	 un 	 like 	 	a	human	,	they	,	you	know	,	have	a	thousand	,	two	thousand	 gene 	 s 	 	;	we	can	figure	out	what	they	are	.
all	we	have	to	do	is	go	around	and	 s 	 ample 	 	,	dig	 in 	 to 	 	the	ground	,	find	 t 	 hose 	 	 bug 	 s 	 	,	sequence	them	,	correlate	them	to	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	we	like	and	do	n't	like	--	that	's	just	a	big	 data 	 base 	 	--	and	then	 fertil 	 ize 	 	.
and	then	we	understand	what	is	 terr 	 oir 	 	.
so	,	some	people	will	say	,	oh	,	my	god	,	are	we	 play 	 ing 	 	god	?
are	we	now	,	if	we	engineer	 organism 	 s 	 	,	are	we	 play 	 ing 	 	god	?
and	,	you	know	,	people	would	 al 	 ways 	 	ask	james	watson	--	he	's	not	 al 	 ways 	 	the	most	 politic 	 ally 	 	correct	guy	...
...	and	they	would	say	,	``	are	,	you	know	,	are	you	 play 	 ing 	 	god	?	``
and	he	had	the	best	answer	i	ever	heard	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	:	``	well	,	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	.	``
i	consider	 my 	 self 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	spiritual	person	,	and	 with 	 out 	 	,	you	know	,	the	 organize 	 d 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	part	,	and	i	will	tell	you	:	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	there	's	 any 	 thing 	 	 un 	 natural 	 	.
i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 chemical 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 natural 	 	.
i	told	you	i	'm	going	to	make	some	of	you	 pu 	 ke 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	:	we	do	n't	invent	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	.
they	're	here	.	they	're	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
we	 re 	 organize 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	change	them	around	,	but	we	do	n't	make	 any 	 thing 	 	 un 	 natural 	 	.
now	,	we	can	create	bad	 impact 	 s 	 	--	we	can	poison	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	;	we	can	poison	the	earth	--	but	that	's	just	a	natural	 out 	 come 	 	of	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	we	made	.
so	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	,	nature	is	 present 	 ing 	 	us	with	a	 tool 	 box 	 	,	and	we	find	that	 th 	 is 	 	 tool 	 box 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 extens 	 ive 	 	.
there	are	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	out	there	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	.
there	are	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	,	you	know	--	go	back	to	 y 	 east 	 	.
these	are	chemical	 factor 	 ies 	 	;	the	most	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	chemical	 factor 	 ies 	 	are	 provide 	 d 	 	by	nature	,	and	we	now	can	use	 t 	 hose 	 	.
there	 al 	 so 	 	is	a	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	.
nature	will	not	allow	you	to	--	we	could	engineer	a	grape	plant	,	but	guess	what	.
we	ca	n't	make	the	grape	plant	produce	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
nature	 ha 	 s 	 	put	a	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	out	there	.
we	can	work	 with 	 in 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	;	we	ca	n't	break	the	 rule 	 s 	 	;	we	're	just	 learn 	 ing 	 	what	the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	.
i	just	ask	the	question	,	if	you	could	cure	all	disease	--	if	you	could	make	disease	go	away	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	understand	how	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	if	we	could	end	 hung 	 er 	 	by	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	create	 nut 	 rit 	 ious 	 	,	 health 	 y 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	that	grow	in	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	-	to	-	grow	 environment 	 s 	 	,	if	we	could	create	clean	and	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	energy	--	we	,	right	in	the	 lab 	 s 	 	at	synthetic	 genomic 	 s 	 	,	have	single	-	celled	 organism 	 s 	 	that	are	taking	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	and	producing	a	molecule	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	.
so	,	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	--	the	stuff	we	want	to	get	rid	of	--	not	sugar	,	not	 any 	 thing 	 	.
carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	a	little	bit	of	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	you	end	up	with	a	lipid	that	is	 high 	 ly 	 	 refine 	 d 	 	.
we	could	solve	our	energy	 problem 	 s 	 	;	we	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	co	2	,	;	we	could	clean	up	our	 ocean 	 s 	 	;	we	could	make	better	wine	.
if	we	could	,	would	we	?
well	,	you	know	,	i	think	the	answer	is	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	:	 work 	 ing 	 	with	nature	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	tool	set	that	we	now	understand	,	is	the	next	step	in	 human 	 kind 	 	's	evolution	.
and	all	i	can	tell	you	is	,	stay	 health 	 y 	 	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	you	can	stay	 health 	 y 	 	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	see	150	,	 may 	 be 	 	300	.
thank	you	.
