lauren	hodge	:	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	a	restaurant	and	 want 	 ed 	 	a	 health 	 ier 	 	option	,	which	would	you	 choos 	 e 	 	,	 grill 	 ed 	 	or	fried	chicken	?
now	most	people	would	answer	 grill 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	's	true	that	 grill 	 ed 	 	chicken	 do 	 es 	 	contain	less	fat	and	 few 	 er 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 grill 	 ed 	 	chicken	 pose 	 s 	 	a	 hid 	 den 	 	danger	.
the	 hid 	 den 	 	danger	is	 hetero 	 cycl 	 ic 	 	amines	--	 specific 	 ally 	 	 pheno 	 methyl 	 imidazopyri 	 dine 	 	,	or	phip	--	which	is	the	 immuno 	 genic 	 	or	 carcinogen 	 ic 	 	 com 	 pound 	 	.
a	carcinogen	is	any	 sub 	 stance 	 	or	agent	that	 cause 	 s 	 	 ab 	 normal 	 	growth	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	can	 al 	 so 	 	cause	them	to	 metasta 	 s 	 ize 	 	or	spread	.
they	are	 al 	 so 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	in	which	one	or	more	of	the	 hydrogen 	 s 	 	in	 ammo 	 nia 	 	is	 replace 	 d 	 	with	a	more	complex	group	.
 stud 	 ies 	 	show	that	 antioxidant 	 s 	 	are	known	to	 de 	 crease 	 	these	 hetero 	 cycl 	 ic 	 	amines	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	no	 stud 	 ies 	 	exist	yet	that	show	how	or	why	.
these	here	are	five	different	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	 class 	 ify 	 	 carcinogen 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	consider	the	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	to	be	safe	,	which	 just 	 ifies 	 	the	need	to	 de 	 crease 	 	them	in	our	diet	.
now	you	might	wonder	how	a	13	year	-	old	girl	could	come	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
and	i	was	led	to	it	through	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 event 	 s 	 	.
i	first	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	it	through	a	 law 	 suit 	 	i	read	about	in	my	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	--	which	was	between	the	physician	's	 commit 	 tee 	 	for	 respons 	 ible 	 	medicine	and	seven	different	fast	food	 restaurant 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 su 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	 carcinogen 	 s 	 	in	the	chicken	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 su 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	california	's	 pro 	 position 	 	65	,	which	 state 	 d 	 	that	if	there	's	 any 	 thing 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	in	the	 product 	 s 	 	then	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	had	to	give	a	clear	 war 	 ning 	 	.
so	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	why	 no 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	more	about	 th 	 is 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 grill 	 ed 	 	chicken	,	which	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	 ver 	 y 	 	 harm 	 ful 	 	.
but	then	one	night	,	my	mom	was	 cook 	 ing 	 	 grill 	 ed 	 	chicken	for	 d 	 inner 	 	,	and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	the	 edge 	 s 	 	of	the	chicken	,	which	had	 be 	 en 	 	 marin 	 ated 	 	in	lemon	juice	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	white	.
and	 lat 	 er 	 	in	biology	class	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	it	's	due	to	a	process	 call 	 ed 	 	 den 	 atur 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	where	the	 protein 	 s 	 	will	change	shape	and	lose	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	 chemical 	 ly 	 	function	.
so	i	 combine 	 d 	 	these	two	 idea 	 s 	 	and	i	 formula 	 ted 	 	a	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	could	possibly	the	 carcinogen 	 s 	 	be	 de 	 crease 	 d 	 	due	to	a	 marin 	 ade 	 	and	could	it	be	due	to	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	ph	?
so	my	idea	was	born	,	and	i	had	the	project	set	up	and	a	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	,	so	what	was	my	next	step	?
well	 obvious 	 ly 	 	i	had	to	find	a	lab	to	work	at	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	have	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	in	my	school	.
i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	easy	,	but	i	 email 	 ed 	 	about	200	different	people	 with 	 in 	 	a	five	-	hour	 radi 	 us 	 	of	where	i	lived	,	and	i	got	one	positive	 respons 	 e 	 	that	 s 	 aid 	 	that	they	could	work	with	me	.
most	of	the	 other 	 s 	 	either	never	 respond 	 ed 	 	back	,	 s 	 aid 	 	they	did	n't	have	the	time	or	did	n't	have	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	and	could	n't	help	me	.
so	it	was	a	big	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	drive	to	the	lab	to	work	 multi 	 ple 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	it	was	a	great	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	work	in	a	real	lab	--	so	i	could	 final 	 ly 	 	start	my	project	.
the	first	stage	was	 complete 	 d 	 	at	home	,	which	 consist 	 ed 	 	of	 marin 	 ating 	 	the	chicken	,	 grill 	 ing 	 	the	chicken	,	 a 	 mass 	 ing 	 	it	and	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	it	to	be	 transport 	 ed 	 	to	the	lab	.
the	second	stage	was	 complete 	 d 	 	at	the	penn	state	university	main	campus	lab	,	which	is	where	i	 extra 	 cted 	 	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	 change 	 d 	 	the	ph	so	i	could	run	it	through	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	and	 separat 	 ed 	 	the	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	from	the	rest	of	the	chicken	.
the	final	 stage 	 s 	 	,	when	i	ran	the	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	through	a	high	-	pressure	liquid	 chro 	 mat 	 ography 	 	mass	 spectro 	 meter 	 	,	which	 separat 	 ed 	 	the	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	and	 analyz 	 ed 	 	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	and	told	me	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	much	 carcinogen 	 s 	 	i	had	in	my	chicken	.
so	when	i	went	through	the	data	,	i	had	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	 result 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	found	that	four	out	of	the	five	 marin 	 ating 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 inhibit 	 ed 	 	the	carcinogen	 form 	 ation 	 	.
when	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	the	 un 	 marin 	 ated 	 	chicken	,	which	is	what	i	used	 a 	 s 	 	my	control	,	i	found	that	lemon	juice	 work 	 ed 	 	by	far	the	best	,	by	about	98	percent	.
the	 salt 	 water 	 	 marin 	 ade 	 	and	the	 brow 	 n 	 	sugar	 marin 	 ade 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	 decr 	 eas 	 ing 	 	the	 carcinogen 	 s 	 	by	about	60	percent	.
 o 	 live 	 	oil	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 de 	 crease 	 d 	 	the	phip	 form 	 ation 	 	,	but	it	was	 near 	 ly 	 	 neglig 	 ible 	 	.
and	the	 so 	 y 	 	sauce	 result 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 conclusive 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	large	data	range	,	but	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	 so 	 y 	 	sauce	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	the	potential	 carcinogen 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	factor	that	i	did	n't	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	 initi 	 ally 	 	was	the	time	 cook 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	found	that	if	you	 in 	 crease 	 	the	time	 cook 	 ed 	 	,	the	amount	of	 carcinogen 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	.
so	the	best	way	to	 marin 	 ate 	 	chicken	,	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	is	to	,	not	under	-	cook	,	but	 definite 	 ly 	 	do	n't	over	-	cook	and	char	the	chicken	,	and	 marin 	 ate 	 	in	either	lemon	juice	,	 brow 	 n 	 	sugar	or	 salt 	 water 	 	.
based	on	these	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	i	have	a	question	for	you	.
would	you	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	simple	change	in	your	diet	that	could	 potential 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	your	life	?
now	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	if	you	eat	 grill 	 ed 	 	chicken	that	's	not	 marin 	 ated 	 	,	you	're	 definite 	 ly 	 	going	to	catch	cancer	and	die	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	you	can	do	to	 de 	 crease 	 	the	risk	of	potential	 carcinogen 	 s 	 	can	 definite 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	the	quality	of	 life 	 style 	 	.
is	it	worth	it	to	you	?
how	will	you	cook	your	chicken	now	?
shree	bose	:	hi	 every 	 one 	 	.	i	'm	shree	bose	.
i	was	the	17-18	year	-	old	age	 categor 	 y 	 	winner	and	then	the	grand	prize	winner	.
and	i	want	all	of	you	to	imagine	a	little	girl	 hold 	 ing 	 	a	dead	blue	 spin 	 ach 	 	plant	.
and	she	's	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	you	and	she	's	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	you	that	little	 kid 	 s 	 	will	eat	 the 	 ir 	 	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	if	they	're	different	 color 	 s 	 	.
 sound 	 s 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	right	.
but	that	was	me	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	that	was	my	first	science	fair	project	.
it	got	a	bit	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	from	there	.
my	 old 	 er 	 	brother	panaki	bose	 s 	 pent 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	of	his	time	 explain 	 ing 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	to	me	when	i	 bare 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	algebra	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	 suffer 	 ed 	 	through	 man 	 y 	 	more	of	my	science	fair	 project 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	a	remote	controlled	garbage	can	.
and	then	came	the	summer	after	my	 fresh 	 man 	 	year	,	when	my	 grand 	 father 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	due	to	cancer	.
and	i	remember	 watch 	 ing 	 	my	family	go	through	that	and	 think 	 ing 	 	that	i	never	 want 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	family	to	feel	that	kind	of	loss	.
so	,	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	all	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	 fresh 	 man 	 	year	biology	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	cancer	research	at	15	.
good	plan	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 email 	 ing 	 	all	of	these	 professor 	 s 	 	in	my	area	 ask 	 ing 	 	to	work	under	 the 	 ir 	 	 super 	 vision 	 	in	a	lab	.
got	 reject 	 ed 	 	by	all	 ex 	 cept 	 	one	.
and	then	went	on	,	my	next	summer	,	to	work	under	dr.	basu	at	the	unt	health	center	at	fort	worth	,	texas	.
and	that	is	where	the	research	 beg 	 an 	 	.
so	 ov 	 arian 	 	cancer	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	that	most	people	do	n't	know	about	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	do	n't	pay	that	much	attention	to	.
but	yet	,	it	's	the	fifth	 lead 	 ing 	 	cause	of	cancer	 death 	 s 	 	among	women	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	one	in	70	women	will	be	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 ov 	 arian 	 	cancer	.
one	in	100	will	die	from	it	.
 chemo 	 therapy 	 	,	one	of	the	most	effective	ways	used	to	treat	cancer	 to 	 day 	 	,	 involve 	 s 	 	giving	 patient 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	high	 dose 	 s 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	to	try	and	kill	off	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	.
cisplatin	is	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	common	 ov 	 arian 	 	cancer	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	drug	--	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	simple	molecule	made	in	the	lab	that	 mess 	 es 	 	with	the	dna	of	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 cause 	 s 	 	them	to	kill	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 sound 	 s 	 	great	,	right	?
but	here	's	the	problem	:	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	resistant	to	the	drug	,	and	then	 year 	 s 	 	after	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 declare 	 d 	 	to	be	cancer	free	,	they	come	back	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	respond	to	the	drug	.
it	's	a	huge	problem	.
in	fact	,	it	's	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	how	these	 ov 	 arian 	 	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	resistant	to	 th 	 is 	 	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	cisplatin	.
and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	figure	 th 	 is 	 	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	could	figure	that	out	,	then	we	might	be	able	to	prevent	that	 resist 	 ance 	 	from	ever	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
so	that	's	what	we	set	out	to	do	.
and	we	thought	it	had	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	protein	 call 	 ed 	 	amp	 kin 	 ase 	 	,	an	energy	protein	.
so	we	ran	all	of	these	 test 	 s 	 	 block 	 ing 	 	the	protein	,	and	we	saw	 th 	 is 	 	huge	shift	.
i	mean	,	on	the	slide	,	you	can	see	that	on	our	sensitive	side	,	these	 cell 	 s 	 	that	are	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	the	drug	,	when	we	start	 block 	 ing 	 	the	protein	,	the	number	of	 dy 	 ing 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	 dot 	 s 	 	--	they	're	going	down	.
but	then	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	with	the	same	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	they	're	going	up	--	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
but	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 dot 	 s 	 	on	a	screen	for	you	;	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
well	 bas 	 ically 	 	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	protein	is	changing	from	the	sensitive	cell	to	the	resistant	cell	.
and	in	fact	,	it	might	be	changing	the	 cell 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	make	the	 cell 	 s 	 	resistant	.
and	that	's	huge	.
in	fact	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	if	a	patient	 come 	 s 	 	in	and	they	're	resistant	to	 th 	 is 	 	drug	,	then	if	we	give	them	a	chemical	to	block	 th 	 is 	 	protein	,	then	we	can	treat	them	 aga 	 in 	 	with	the	same	drug	.
and	that	's	huge	for	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	 effective 	 ness 	 	--	possibly	for	 man 	 y 	 	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	cancer	.
so	that	was	my	work	,	and	it	was	my	way	of	 re 	 imagin 	 ing 	 	the	future	for	future	research	,	with	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 th 	 is 	 	protein	 do 	 es 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	for	the	future	of	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	 effective 	 ness 	 	--	so	 may 	 be 	 	all	 grand 	 father 	 s 	 	with	cancer	have	a	little	bit	more	time	to	 s 	 pend 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 children 	 	.
but	my	work	was	n't	just	about	the	research	.
it	was	about	 find 	 ing 	 	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
that	's	why	 be 	 ing 	 	the	grand	prize	winner	of	the	google	global	science	fair	--	cute	picture	,	right	--	it	was	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	me	and	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	honor	.
and	ever	since	then	,	i	've	gotten	to	do	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	stuff	--	from	 get 	 ting 	 	to	meet	the	 p 	 resident 	 	to	 get 	 ting 	 	to	be	on	 th 	 is 	 	stage	to	talk	to	all	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	.
but	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	my	journey	was	n't	just	about	the	research	,	it	was	about	 find 	 ing 	 	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	and	it	was	about	making	my	own	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	when	i	did	n't	even	know	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	about	inspiration	and	 determi 	 nation 	 	and	never	giving	up	on	my	interest	for	science	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	growing	.
after	all	,	my	story	 begin 	 s 	 	with	a	dried	,	 with 	 er 	 ed 	 	 spin 	 ach 	 	plant	and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	better	from	there	.
thank	you	.
naomi	shah	:	hi	 every 	 one 	 	.	i	'm	naomi	shah	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	i	'll	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	about	my	research	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	 in 	 door 	 	air	quality	and	 asthma 	 tic 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	.
1.6	million	 death 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
one	death	every	20	 second 	 s 	 	.
people	 s 	 pend 	 	over	90	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	.
and	the	economic	burden	of	asthma	 exceed 	 s 	 	that	of	hiv	and	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	.
now	these	 statistic 	 s 	 	had	a	huge	impact	on	me	,	but	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 spark 	 ed 	 	my	interest	in	my	research	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	both	my	dad	and	my	brother	suffer	from	chronic	 alle 	 rgie 	 s 	 	year	-	round	.
it	 con 	 fused 	 	me	;	why	did	these	 alle 	 rgy 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	persist	well	past	the	 poll 	 en 	 	season	?
with	 th 	 is 	 	question	in	mind	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 research 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	soon	found	that	 in 	 door 	 	air	 pollutant 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	culprit	.
 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	 investigate 	 d 	 	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	relationship	between	four	 pre 	 valent 	 	air	 pollutant 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	affect	on	the	lung	health	of	 asthma 	 tic 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	.
at	first	,	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	which	of	these	four	 pollutant 	 s 	 	have	the	largest	negative	health	impact	on	the	lung	health	of	 asthma 	 tic 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	.
but	soon	after	,	i	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	novel	 mathematic 	 al 	 	model	that	 essential 	 ly 	 	 quant 	 ifies 	 	the	effect	of	these	 environment 	 al 	 	 pollutant 	 s 	 	on	the	lung	health	of	 asthma 	 tic 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 surprise 	 s 	 	me	that	no	model	 current 	 ly 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	that	 quant 	 ifies 	 	the	effect	of	 environment 	 al 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	on	human	lung	health	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	relationship	 seem 	 s 	 	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.
so	with	that	in	mind	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 research 	 ing 	 	more	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	more	,	and	i	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	passionate	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	if	we	could	find	a	way	to	target	 remedi 	 ation 	 	,	we	could	 al 	 so 	 	find	a	way	to	treat	 asthma 	 tic 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	more	 effective 	 ly 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 volatil 	 e 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	are	chemical	 pollutant 	 s 	 	that	are	found	in	our	 school 	 s 	 	,	 home 	 s 	 	and	 work 	 place 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 every 	 where 	 	.
these	chemical	 pollutant 	 s 	 	are	 current 	 ly 	 	not	a	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	air	pollutant	,	 a 	 s 	 	defined	by	the	u.s.	clean	air	act	.
which	is	surprising	to	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	chemical	 pollutant 	 s 	 	,	through	my	research	,	i	show	that	they	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	negative	impact	on	the	lung	health	of	 asthma 	 tic 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	and	thus	should	be	 regulat 	 ed 	 	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	show	you	my	 inter 	 active 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	model	that	i	 create 	 d 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	show	it	to	you	on	my	 lap 	 top 	 	.
and	i	have	a	volunteer	subject	in	the	audience	 to 	 day 	 	,	julie	.
and	all	of	julie	's	data	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	pre	-	 enter 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	 inter 	 active 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	model	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	used	by	 any 	 one 	 	.
so	i	want	you	to	imagine	that	you	're	in	julie	's	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	or	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	 re 	 ally 	 	close	to	you	who	 suffer 	 s 	 	from	asthma	or	 an 	 other 	 	lung	 dis 	 order 	 	.
so	julie	's	going	to	her	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	to	get	 treat 	 ed 	 	for	her	asthma	.
and	the	doctor	 ha 	 s 	 	her	 s 	 it 	 	down	,	and	he	 take 	 s 	 	her	peak	 expir 	 atory 	 	flow	rate	--	which	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	her	 exhal 	 ation 	 	rate	,	or	the	amount	of	air	that	she	can	breathe	out	in	one	breath	.
so	that	peak	 expir 	 atory 	 	flow	rate	,	i	've	 enter 	 ed 	 	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	 inter 	 active 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	model	.
i	've	 al 	 so 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	in	her	age	,	her	gender	and	her	height	.
i	've	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	she	 live 	 s 	 	in	an	average	 house 	 hold 	 	with	average	air	pollutant	 level 	 s 	 	.
so	any	user	can	come	in	here	and	click	on	``	lung	function	report	``	and	it	'll	take	them	to	 th 	 is 	 	report	that	i	 create 	 d 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	report	 re 	 ally 	 	 drive 	 s 	 	home	the	crux	of	my	research	.
so	what	it	 show 	 s 	 	--	if	you	want	to	focus	on	that	top	graph	in	the	right	-	hand	corner	--	it	 show 	 s 	 	julie	's	actual	peak	 expir 	 atory 	 	flow	rate	in	the	yellow	bar	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 measure 	 ment 	 	that	she	took	in	her	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	.
in	the	blue	bar	at	the	bottom	of	the	graph	,	it	 show 	 s 	 	what	her	peak	 expir 	 atory 	 	flow	rate	,	what	her	 exhal 	 ation 	 	rate	or	lung	health	,	should	be	based	on	her	age	,	gender	and	height	.
so	the	doctor	 s 	 ees 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	yellow	bar	and	the	blue	bar	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	we	need	to	give	her	 steroid 	 s 	 	,	 medic 	 ation 	 	and	 inhal 	 ers 	 	.	``
but	i	want	 every 	 one 	 	here	to	 re 	 imagine 	 	a	world	where	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 pre 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	 steroid 	 s 	 	,	 inhal 	 ers 	 	and	 medic 	 ation 	 	,	the	doctor	 turn 	 s 	 	to	julie	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	you	go	home	and	clean	out	your	air	 filter 	 s 	 	.
clean	out	the	air	 duct 	 s 	 	in	your	home	,	in	your	 work 	 place 	 	,	in	your	school	.
stop	the	use	of	incense	and	 candle 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	're	 re 	 model 	 ing 	 	your	house	,	take	out	all	the	 carpet 	 ing 	 	and	put	in	 hard 	 wood 	 	 floor 	 ing 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	these	 solution 	 s 	 	are	natural	,	these	 solution 	 s 	 	are	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	and	these	 solution 	 s 	 	are	long	-	term	 invest 	 ments 	 	--	long	-	term	 invest 	 ments 	 	that	we	're	making	for	our	generation	and	for	future	 generation 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	these	 environment 	 al 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	that	julie	can	make	in	her	home	,	her	 work 	 place 	 	and	her	school	are	 impact 	 ing 	 	 every 	 one 	 	that	 live 	 s 	 	around	her	.
so	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	passionate	about	 th 	 is 	 	research	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	 continu 	 e 	 	it	and	expand	it	to	more	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	asthma	,	more	 respirator 	 y 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	more	 pollutant 	 s 	 	.
but	before	i	end	my	talk	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	one	 say 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	 say 	 ing 	 	is	that	 genetic 	 s 	 	 load 	 s 	 	the	gun	,	but	the	environment	 pull 	 s 	 	the	trigger	.
and	that	made	a	huge	impact	on	me	when	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	research	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	i	feel	,	is	a	lot	of	us	think	that	the	environment	is	at	a	macro	level	,	that	we	ca	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	to	change	our	air	quality	or	to	change	the	climate	or	 any 	 thing 	 	.
but	if	each	one	of	us	 take 	 s 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	in	our	own	home	,	in	our	own	school	and	in	our	own	 work 	 place 	 	,	we	can	make	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	air	quality	.
 be 	 cause 	 	remember	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	90	percent	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	.
and	air	quality	and	air	 pollutant 	 s 	 	have	a	huge	impact	on	the	lung	health	of	 asthma 	 tic 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 any 	 one 	 	with	a	 respirator 	 y 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	all	of	us	in	general	.
so	i	want	you	to	 re 	 imagine 	 	a	world	with	better	air	quality	,	better	quality	of	life	and	better	quality	of	living	for	 every 	 one 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	our	future	 generation 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
