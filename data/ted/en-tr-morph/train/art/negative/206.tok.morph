we	're	going	to	go	on	a	 d 	 ive 	 	to	the	deep	sea	,	and	 any 	 one 	 	that	's	had	that	 love 	 ly 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	for	about	two	and	half	 hour 	 s 	 	on	the	way	down	,	it	's	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 positive 	 ly 	 	pitch	-	black	world	.
and	we	used	to	see	the	most	 myster 	 ious 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	out	the	window	that	you	could	n't	 de 	 scribe 	 	:	these	 blink 	 ing 	 	 light 	 s 	 	--	a	world	of	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	,	like	 fire 	 flies 	 	.
dr.	edith	widder	--	she	's	now	at	the	ocean	research	and	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 associ 	 ation 	 	--	was	able	to	come	up	with	a	camera	that	could	capture	some	of	these	 in 	 credible 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	on	the	screen	.
that	's	all	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	.	so	,	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	:	just	like	 fire 	 flies 	 	.
there	's	a	 fly 	 ing 	 	 tur 	 key 	 	under	a	tree	.
i	'm	a	 geo 	 logist 	 	by	training	.	but	i	love	that	.
and	you	see	,	some	of	the	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	they	use	to	avoid	 be 	 ing 	 	eaten	,	some	they	use	to	attract	 pre 	 y 	 	,	but	all	of	it	,	from	an	 art 	 istic 	 	point	of	view	,	is	 positive 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
and	a	lot	of	what	 go 	 es 	 	on	 in 	 side 	 	...
there	's	a	fish	with	 glow 	 ing 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	 puls 	 ating 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
some	of	the	 color 	 s 	 	are	designed	to	 hypno 	 tize 	 	,	these	 love 	 ly 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	last	one	,	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 pin 	 wheel 	 	design	.
just	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	every	single	 d 	 ive 	 	.
that	's	the	 un 	 known 	 	world	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 explore 	 d 	 	about	3	percent	of	what	's	out	there	in	the	ocean	.
 al 	 ready 	 	we	've	found	the	world	's	highest	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	the	world	's	 deep 	 est 	 	 val 	 ley 	 s 	 	,	 under 	 water 	 	 lake 	 s 	 	,	 under 	 water 	 	 water 	 fall 	 s 	 	--	a	lot	of	that	we	 share 	 d 	 	with	you	from	the	stage	.
and	in	a	place	where	we	thought	no	life	at	all	,	we	find	more	life	,	we	think	,	and	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	density	than	the	 tropic 	 al 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 	,	which	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	we	do	n't	know	much	about	 th 	 is 	 	planet	at	all	.
there	's	still	97	percent	,	and	either	that	97	percent	is	empty	or	just	full	of	 surprise 	 s 	 	.
but	i	want	to	jump	up	to	 sh 	 allow 	 	water	now	and	look	at	some	 creature 	 s 	 	that	are	 positive 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
 cephalopod 	 s 	 	--	head	-	foots	.	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	i	 k 	 new 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	 calam 	 ari 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 oct 	 opus 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	work	of	dr.	roger	hanlon	at	the	marine	 bio 	 logical 	 	lab	--	and	it	's	just	 fasci 	 nating 	 	how	 cephalopod 	 s 	 	can	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	sense	 the 	 ir 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	look	at	light	,	look	at	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
here	's	an	 oct 	 opus 	 	moving	 a 	 cross 	 	the	reef	,	 find 	 s 	 	a	spot	to	settle	down	,	 curl 	 s 	 	up	and	then	 disappear 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
tough	thing	to	do	.
in	the	next	bit	,	we	're	going	to	see	a	couple	 s 	 quid 	 	.
these	are	 s 	 quid 	 	.	now	 male 	 s 	 	,	when	they	fight	,	if	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	,	they	turn	white	.
and	these	two	 male 	 s 	 	are	 fight 	 ing 	 	,	they	do	it	by	 bounc 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 butt 	 s 	 	together	,	which	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	.	now	,	here	's	a	male	on	the	left	and	a	female	on	the	right	,	and	the	male	 ha 	 s 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	to	split	his	 color 	 ation 	 	so	the	female	 on 	 ly 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 ees 	 	the	 kind 	 er 	 	 gentle 	 r 	 	 s 	 quid 	 	in	him	.
and	the	male	...	we	're	going	to	see	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
let	's	take	a	look	at	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.	watch	the	 color 	 ation 	 	:	white	on	the	right	,	 brow 	 n 	 	on	the	left	.
he	 take 	 s 	 	a	step	back	--	so	he	's	 keep 	 ing 	 	off	the	other	 male 	 s 	 	by	 split 	 ting 	 	his	body	--	and	 come 	 s 	 	up	on	the	other	side	...
 bing 	 o 	 	!	now	i	'm	told	that	's	not	just	a	 s 	 quid 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	with	 male 	 s 	 	,	but	i	do	n't	know	.
 cu 	 ttle 	 fish 	 	.	i	love	 cu 	 ttle 	 fish 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	giant	australian	 cu 	 ttle 	 fish 	 	.
and	there	he	is	,	his	 dro 	 opy 	 	little	 eye 	 s 	 	up	here	.
but	they	can	do	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	too	.
here	we	're	going	to	see	one	 back 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 cre 	 vice 	 	,	and	watch	his	 tent 	 acle 	 s 	 	--	he	just	 pull 	 s 	 	them	in	,	 make 	 s 	 	them	look	just	like	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	.
 disappear 	 s 	 	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
 positive 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	here	's	two	 male 	 s 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	.
once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	're	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	,	these	 cephalopod 	 s 	 	;	they	know	not	to	hurt	each	other	.
but	look	at	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	they	can	do	with	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	.
that	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	.
here	's	an	 oct 	 opus 	 	.	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	want	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	when	they	move	 be 	 cause 	 	 predator 	 s 	 	can	see	them	.
here	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	make	 him 	 self 	 	look	like	a	rock	,	and	,	looking	at	his	environment	,	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	slide	 a 	 cross 	 	the	bottom	,	using	the	 wave 	 s 	 	and	the	 shadow 	 s 	 	so	he	ca	n't	be	 s 	 een 	 	.
his	motion	 blend 	 s 	 	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	 back 	 ground 	 	--	the	moving	rock	trick	.	so	,	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	new	from	the	 sh 	 allow 	 	water	.
still	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	deep	,	but	 learn 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	from	the	 sh 	 allow 	 	water	.
there	's	a	good	reason	why	:	the	 sh 	 allow 	 	water	's	full	of	 predator 	 s 	 	--	here	's	a	 bar 	 racuda 	 	--	and	if	you	're	an	 oct 	 opus 	 	or	a	cephalopod	,	you	need	to	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	how	to	use	your	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	hide	.
in	the	next	scene	,	you	're	going	to	see	a	nice	coral	bottom	.
and	you	see	that	an	 oct 	 opus 	 	would	stand	out	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	there	if	you	could	n't	use	your	camouflage	,	use	your	skin	to	change	color	and	 text 	 ure 	 	.
here	's	some	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	in	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	...
and	an	 oct 	 opus 	 	.	ai	n't	that	 amaz 	 ing 	 	?	now	,	roger	 spook 	 ed 	 	him	so	he	took	off	in	a	cloud	of	ink	,	and	when	he	 land 	 s 	 	the	 oct 	 opus 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	.
the	best	thing	to	do	is	to	get	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	get	.	``
that	big	 brow 	 n 	 	 make 	 s 	 	his	 eye 	 spot 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	big	.
so	,	he	's	 bluff 	 ing 	 	.	let	's	do	it	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	--	i	thought	he	was	 jok 	 ing 	 	when	he	first	 show 	 ed 	 	it	to	me	.
i	thought	it	was	all	 graphic 	 s 	 	--	so	here	it	is	in	reverse	.
watch	the	skin	color	;	watch	the	skin	 text 	 ure 	 	.
just	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	animal	,	it	can	change	color	and	 text 	 ure 	 	to	match	the	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	watch	him	blend	right	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	.
one	,	two	,	three	.
and	now	he	's	gone	,	and	so	am	i.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
