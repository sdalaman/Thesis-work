i	used	to	be	a	malthusian	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	my	mental	model	of	the	world	:	 expl 	 o 	 d 	 ing 	 	population	,	small	planet	;	it	's	going	to	lead	to	 ug 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	moving	past	malthus	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	that	we	just	might	be	about	150	 year 	 s 	 	from	a	kind	of	new	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
here	's	why	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	u.n.	's	population	data	,	you	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	,	for	the	world	.
and	the	world	's	population	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	top	out	at	 some 	 thing 	 	 hope 	 fully 	 	a	bit	less	than	10	billion	,	late	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
and	after	that	,	most	 like 	 ly 	 	it	's	going	to	begin	to	decline	.
so	what	then	?
most	of	the	economic	 model 	 s 	 	are	built	around	 scar 	 city 	 	and	growth	.
so	a	lot	of	 economist 	 s 	 	look	at	 dec 	 lining 	 	population	and	expect	to	see	 stag 	 nation 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
but	a	 dec 	 lining 	 	population	is	going	to	have	at	 l 	 east 	 	two	 ver 	 y 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	economic	 effect 	 s 	 	.
one	:	 few 	 er 	 	people	on	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	amount	of	land	make	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	 proper 	 ty 	 	a	bad	bet	.
in	the	cities	,	a	lot	of	the	cost	of	 proper 	 ty 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	in	 it 	 s 	 	 specul 	 ative 	 	value	.
take	away	land	 specul 	 ation 	 	,	price	of	land	 drop 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 begin 	 s 	 	to	lift	a	heavy	burden	off	the	world	's	poor	.
number	two	:	a	 dec 	 lining 	 	population	 mean 	 s 	 	scarce	labor	.
scarce	labor	 drive 	 s 	 	 wage 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 wage 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	that	 al 	 so 	 	 lift 	 s 	 	the	burden	on	the	poor	and	the	 work 	 ing 	 	class	.
now	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	radical	drop	in	population	like	we	saw	in	the	black	death	.
but	look	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	europe	after	the	plague	:	 ris 	 ing 	 	 wage 	 s 	 	,	land	reform	,	 techno 	 logical 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	birth	of	the	middle	class	;	and	after	that	,	forward	-	looking	social	 move 	 ments 	 	like	the	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	,	and	 lat 	 er 	 	the	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
most	of	our	cultural	heritage	 ha 	 s 	 	 tend 	 ed 	 	to	look	 back 	 ward 	 	,	 romantic 	 izing 	 	the	past	.
all	of	the	western	 relig 	 ions 	 	begin	with	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	eden	,	and	descend	through	a	kind	of	 pro 	 fli 	 gate 	 	present	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	future	.
so	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	 view 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	 th 	 is 	 	 down 	 hill 	 	slide	from	the	good	old	 day 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	we	're	in	for	 an 	 other 	 	change	,	about	two	 generation 	 s 	 	after	the	top	of	that	 curv 	 e 	 	,	once	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	a	 dec 	 lining 	 	population	start	to	settle	in	.
at	that	point	,	we	'll	start	 romantic 	 izing 	 	the	future	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	nasty	,	 b 	 rut 	 ish 	 	past	.
so	why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	matter	?
why	talk	about	social	-	economic	 move 	 ments 	 	that	may	be	more	than	a	century	away	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 transit 	 ions 	 	are	 danger 	 ous 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
when	land	 owner 	 s 	 	start	to	lose	money	,	and	labor	 demand 	 s 	 	more	pay	,	there	are	some	 power 	 ful 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	fear	for	the	future	.
fear	for	the	future	 lead 	 s 	 	to	some	rash	 decision 	 s 	 	.
if	we	have	a	positive	view	about	the	future	then	we	may	be	able	to	 accele 	 rate 	 	through	that	turn	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 care 	 en 	 ing 	 	off	a	cliff	.
if	we	can	make	it	through	the	next	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	think	that	your	great	great	 grand 	 children 	 	will	forget	all	about	malthus	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	,	they	'll	be	 plan 	 ning 	 	for	the	future	and	 start 	 ing 	 	to	build	the	22nd	century	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
thank	you	.
