when	my	brother	 call 	 ed 	 	me	in	december	of	1998	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	news	 do 	 es 	 	not	look	good	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	him	on	the	screen	.
he	'd	just	 be 	 en 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	als	,	which	is	a	disease	that	the	average	 life 	 span 	 	is	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	 paralyze 	 s 	 	you	.	it	 start 	 s 	 	by	 kill 	 ing 	 	the	motor	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	your	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	.
and	you	go	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 health 	 y 	 	,	 ro 	 bust 	 	29	-	year	-	old	male	to	 some 	 one 	 	that	can	not	breathe	,	can	not	move	,	can	not	speak	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	to	me	,	a	gift	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 beg 	 an 	 	a	journey	to	learn	a	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	life	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	steven	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	had	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	journey	 a 	 s 	 	a	family	.
we	did	not	even	--	i	think	 advers 	 ity 	 	is	not	even	the	right	word	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	're	going	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	in	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	positive	way	.	``
and	i	want	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	about	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	,	which	was	to	think	about	a	new	way	of	 approach 	 ing 	 	 health 	 care 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	all	know	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
i	want	to	talk	about	it	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	a	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	story	of	my	brother	.
but	it	's	just	a	story	.	and	i	want	to	go	beyond	the	story	,	and	go	to	 some 	 thing 	 	more	.
``	 give 	 n 	 	my	 stat 	 us 	 	,	what	is	the	best	 out 	 come 	 	i	can	hope	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	,	and	how	do	i	get	there	?	``
is	what	we	are	here	to	do	in	medicine	,	is	what	 every 	 one 	 	should	do	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	all	have	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	to	them	.
all	of	our	 stat 	 uses 	 	are	different	.
all	of	our	 hope 	 s 	 	and	 dream 	 s 	 	,	what	we	want	to	accomplish	,	is	different	,	and	our	 path 	 s 	 	will	be	different	,	they	are	all	 st 	 ories 	 	.
but	it	's	a	story	 un 	 til 	 	we	convert	it	to	data	and	so	what	we	do	,	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	we	had	,	was	to	take	steven	's	 stat 	 us 	 	,	``	what	is	my	 stat 	 us 	 	?	``
and	go	from	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	his	 hand 	 s 	 	,	speak	,	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	happiness	and	function	.
so	,	the	first	set	of	 patho 	 logies 	 	,	they	end	up	in	the	stick	man	on	his	icon	,	but	the	rest	of	them	are	 re 	 ally 	 	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	here	.
 be 	 cause 	 	steven	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	he	was	 paralyze 	 d 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	was	in	that	pool	,	he	could	not	walk	,	he	could	not	use	his	 arm 	 s 	 	--	that	's	why	he	had	the	little	 float 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	them	,	did	you	see	 t 	 hose 	 	?	--	he	was	happy	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	beach	,	he	was	raising	his	son	,	and	he	was	productive	.
and	we	took	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	 convert 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	data	.
but	it	's	not	a	data	point	at	that	one	moment	in	time	.
it	is	a	data	point	of	steven	in	a	 con 	 text 	 	.
here	he	is	in	the	pool	.	but	here	he	is	 health 	 y 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 build 	 er 	 	:	 tall 	 er 	 	,	 strong 	 er 	 	,	got	all	the	women	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 	guy	.
here	he	is	 walk 	 ing 	 	down	the	aisle	,	but	he	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	walk	now	,	so	it	's	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
and	he	could	still	hold	his	wife	's	hand	,	but	he	could	n't	do	 button 	 s 	 	on	his	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	ca	n't	feed	 him 	 self 	 	.
and	here	he	is	,	 paralyze 	 d 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	 un 	 able 	 	to	breathe	and	move	,	over	 th 	 is 	 	time	journey	.
these	 st 	 ories 	 	of	his	life	,	 convert 	 ed 	 	to	data	.
he	 renovate 	 d 	 	my	carriage	house	when	he	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	,	and	 un 	 able 	 	to	speak	,	and	 un 	 able 	 	to	breathe	,	and	he	won	an	 a 	 ward 	 	for	a	historic	 resto 	 ration 	 	.
so	,	here	's	steven	 al 	 one 	 	,	sharing	 th 	 is 	 	story	in	the	world	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 in 	 sight 	 	,	the	thing	that	we	are	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	gone	away	from	the	community	that	we	are	,	the	fact	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	love	each	other	and	want	to	care	for	each	other	.
we	need	to	give	to	 other 	 s 	 	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	.
so	,	steven	is	sharing	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	but	he	is	not	 al 	 one 	 	.
there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	sharing	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
not	 st 	 ories 	 	in	 word 	 s 	 	,	but	 st 	 ories 	 	in	data	and	 word 	 s 	 	.
and	we	convert	that	information	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	structure	,	 th 	 is 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	convert	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 com 	 put 	 able 	 	,	to	which	we	can	begin	to	change	the	way	medicine	is	 d 	 one 	 	and	 deliver 	 ed 	 	.
we	did	 th 	 is 	 	for	als	.	we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	parkinson	's	disease	,	hiv	.
these	are	not	simple	,	they	are	not	 inter 	 net 	 	 scal 	 able 	 	;	they	 requir 	 e 	 	thought	and	 process 	 es 	 	to	find	the	 meaning 	 ful 	 	information	about	the	disease	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	when	you	go	to	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	what	 patient 	 s 	 	like	me	,	the	company	that	 my 	 self 	 	,	my	 young 	 est 	 	brother	and	a	good	friend	from	mit	 start 	 ed 	 	.
here	are	the	actual	 patient 	 s 	 	,	there	are	45,000	of	them	now	,	sharing	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 a 	 s 	 	data	.
here	is	an	m.s	.	patient	.
his	name	is	 mi 	 ke 	 	,	and	he	is	 uniform 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	on	cognition	,	vision	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	 sens 	 ation 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	different	for	each	m.s	.	patient	.
each	of	them	can	have	a	different	 character 	 istic 	 	.
you	can	see	 fibro 	 myalgia 	 	,	hiv	,	als	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	hiv	patient	down	here	,	zinny	.
it	's	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	disease	.	all	of	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	are	not	there	.
but	he	is	 work 	 ing 	 	to	keep	his	cd	4	count	high	and	his	viral	level	low	so	he	can	make	his	life	better	.
but	you	can	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	you	can	discover	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 treat 	 ments 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	2,000	people	 al 	 most 	 	,	on	copaxone	.
these	are	 patient 	 s 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	on	 drug 	 s 	 	,	sharing	data	.
i	love	some	of	these	,	physical	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	 pray 	 er 	 	.
 any 	 one 	 	want	to	run	a	 compar 	 ative 	 	 effective 	 ness 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	on	 pray 	 er 	 	against	 some 	 thing 	 	?	let	's	look	at	 pray 	 er 	 	.
what	i	love	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	just	sort	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	design	 problem 	 s 	 	.
these	are	why	people	pray	.
here	is	the	schedule	of	how	 frequent 	 ly 	 	they	--	it	's	a	dose	.
so	,	 any 	 one 	 	want	to	see	the	32	 patient 	 s 	 	that	pray	for	60	 minute 	 s 	 	a	day	,	and	see	if	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	better	,	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	are	.
here	they	are	.	it	's	an	open	network	,	 every 	 body 	 	is	sharing	.	we	can	see	it	all	.
or	,	i	want	to	look	at	 anxie 	 ty 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	are	 pray 	 ing 	 	for	 anxie 	 ty 	 	.
and	here	is	data	on	15,000	people	's	current	 anxie 	 ty 	 	,	right	now	.
how	they	treat	it	,	the	 drug 	 s 	 	,	the	 component 	 s 	 	of	it	,	 the 	 ir 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	all	of	it	in	a	rich	environment	,	and	you	can	drill	down	and	see	the	 individual 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	data	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	drill	down	and	see	what	 th 	 is 	 	drug	is	for	--	1,500	people	on	 th 	 is 	 	drug	,	i	think	.	 y 	 es 	 	.
i	want	to	talk	to	the	58	 patient 	 s 	 	down	here	who	are	taking	four	 milli 	 gram 	 s 	 	a	day	.
and	i	want	to	talk	to	the	 one 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	more	than	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	can	see	the	 dur 	 ation 	 	.
all	open	,	all	 avail 	 able 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	log	in	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	brother	's	profile	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	version	of	our	platform	we	're	 launch 	 ing 	 	right	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	second	generation	.	it	's	going	to	be	in	flash	.
and	you	can	see	here	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 animate 	 s 	 	over	,	steven	's	actual	data	against	the	 back 	 ground 	 	of	all	other	 patient 	 s 	 	,	against	 th 	 is 	 	information	.
the	blue	band	is	the	50th	 percent 	 ile 	 	.	steven	is	the	75th	 percent 	 ile 	 	,	that	he	 ha 	 s 	 	non	-	genetic	als	.
you	scroll	down	in	 th 	 is 	 	profile	and	you	can	see	all	of	his	prescription	 drug 	 s 	 	,	but	more	than	that	,	in	the	new	version	,	i	can	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 interact 	 ively 	 	.
wait	,	poor	 spin 	 al 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	n't	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	a	great	stock	program	?
would	n't	it	be	great	if	the	technology	we	used	to	take	care	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	was	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	technology	we	use	to	make	money	?
detrol	.	in	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	for	his	drug	,	 integrate 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	,	the	stem	cell	transplant	that	he	had	,	the	first	in	the	world	,	 share 	 d 	 	 open 	 ly 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	see	it	.
i	love	here	--	the	 cyber 	 kine 	 tics 	 	implant	,	which	was	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	patient	's	data	that	was	 on 	 line 	 	and	 avail 	 able 	 	.
you	can	adjust	the	time	scale	.	you	can	adjust	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
you	can	look	at	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	between	how	i	treat	my	als	.
so	,	you	click	down	on	the	als	tab	there	.
i	'm	taking	three	 drug 	 s 	 	to	manage	it	.	some	of	them	are	 experiment 	 al 	 	.
i	can	look	at	my	 con 	 s 	 tip 	 ation 	 	,	how	to	manage	it	.
i	can	see	 magn 	 es 	 ium 	 	 cit 	 rate 	 	,	and	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	from	that	drug	all	 integrate 	 d 	 	in	the	time	in	which	they	're	 meaning 	 ful 	 	.
but	i	want	more	.
i	do	n't	want	to	just	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	cool	 de 	 vice 	 	,	i	want	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	data	and	make	 some 	 thing 	 	even	better	.
i	want	my	brother	's	center	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	his	 symptom 	 s 	 	and	his	 drug 	 s 	 	,	and	all	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	interact	among	 t 	 hose 	 	,	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	to	be	in	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	data	 galax 	 y 	 	that	we	can	look	at	in	any	way	we	want	to	understand	it	,	so	that	we	can	take	 th 	 is 	 	information	and	go	beyond	just	 th 	 is 	 	simple	model	of	what	a	record	is	.
i	do	n't	even	know	what	a	medical	record	is	.
i	want	to	solve	a	problem	.	i	want	an	application	.
so	,	can	i	take	 th 	 is 	 	data	--	 re 	 arrange 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	put	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	in	the	left	,	the	 drug 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	top	,	tell	me	 every 	 thing 	 	we	know	about	steven	and	 every 	 one 	 	else	,	and	what	 interact 	 s 	 	.
 year 	 s 	 	after	he	's	had	these	 drug 	 s 	 	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	he	did	to	manage	his	excess	saliva	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	some	positive	side	 effect 	 s 	 	that	came	from	other	 drug 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	making	his	 con 	 s 	 tip 	 ation 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
and	if	 any 	 one 	 	's	ever	had	severe	 con 	 s 	 tip 	 ation 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	understand	how	much	of	an	impact	that	 ha 	 s 	 	on	your	life	--	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	was	a	pun	.
you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	manage	these	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	grid	is	 avail 	 able 	 	here	,	and	we	want	to	understand	it	.
no	one	's	ever	had	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	information	.
so	,	 patient 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	.	we	're	for	 patient 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	about	patient	health	care	,	there	was	no	 doctor 	 s 	 	on	our	network	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	the	 patient 	 s 	 	.
so	,	how	can	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	them	a	tool	that	they	can	go	back	and	they	can	engage	the	medical	system	?
and	we	 work 	 ed 	 	hard	,	and	we	thought	about	it	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	use	all	the	time	,	that	we	can	use	in	the	medical	care	system	,	that	 every 	 one 	 	will	understand	?	``
so	,	the	 patient 	 s 	 	print	it	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 hospital 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	block	us	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 believ 	 e 	 	we	are	a	social	network	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	most	used	feature	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
 doctor 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	love	 th 	 is 	 	sheet	,	and	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	we	went	from	 th 	 is 	 	story	of	steven	and	his	 histo 	 ry 	 	to	data	,	and	then	back	to	paper	,	where	we	went	back	and	 engag 	 ed 	 	the	medical	care	system	.
and	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	paper	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	journal	,	pnas	--	i	think	it	's	the	 proceed 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	national	academy	of	science	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	.
you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	of	these	 to 	 day 	 	,	when	 every 	 one 	 	's	 brag 	 ging 	 	about	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	report	about	a	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	 lith 	 ium 	 	.
 lith 	 ium 	 	,	that	is	a	drug	used	to	treat	 bi 	 polar 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	,	that	a	group	in	italy	found	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	als	down	in	16	 patient 	 s 	 	,	and	 publish 	 ed 	 	it	.
now	,	we	'll	skip	the	 critique 	 s 	 	of	the	paper	.
but	the	short	story	is	:	if	you	're	a	patient	,	you	want	to	be	on	the	blue	line	.
you	do	n't	want	to	be	on	the	red	line	,	you	want	to	be	on	the	blue	line	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	blue	line	is	a	better	line	.	the	red	line	is	way	 down 	 hill 	 	,	the	blue	line	is	a	good	line	.
so	,	you	know	we	 s 	 aid 	 	--	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	what	i	love	 al 	 so 	 	is	that	people	 al 	 ways 	 	 accus 	 e 	 	these	 inter 	 net 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	of	promoting	bad	medicine	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	people	do	 thing 	 s 	 	 ir 	 respons 	 ibly 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	pnas	 publish 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
ten	percent	of	the	people	in	our	system	took	 lith 	 ium 	 	.
ten	percent	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	 lith 	 ium 	 	based	on	16	 patient 	 s 	 	of	data	in	a	bad	 public 	 ation 	 	.
and	they	call	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ir 	 respons 	 ible 	 	.
here	's	the	 implic 	 ation 	 	of	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	one	guy	,	named	humberto	,	from	brazil	,	who	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	nine	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	listen	.	can	you	help	us	answer	 th 	 is 	 	question	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	want	to	wait	for	the	next	trial	,	it	's	going	to	be	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	know	now	.	can	you	help	us	?	``
so	,	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	some	 tool 	 s 	 	,	we	let	them	track	 the 	 ir 	 	blood	 level 	 s 	 	.
we	let	them	share	the	data	and	 ex 	 change 	 	it	.
you	know	,	a	data	network	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	``	jamie	,	plm	,	can	you	 guy 	 s 	 	tell	us	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	or	not	?	``
and	we	went	around	and	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	people	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	ca	n't	run	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	you	know	?
you	do	n't	have	the	 blind 	 ing 	 	,	you	do	n't	have	data	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	follow	the	scientific	method	.
it	's	never	going	to	work	.	you	ca	n't	do	it	.	``
so	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	well	we	ca	n't	do	that	.	then	we	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	.	``
i	ca	n't	say	 whet 	 her 	 	 lith 	 ium 	 	 work 	 s 	 	in	all	als	 patient 	 s 	 	,	but	i	can	say	 whet 	 her 	 	it	 work 	 s 	 	in	humberto	.
i	 b 	 ought 	 	a	mac	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 convert 	 ed 	 	over	,	and	i	was	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	new	feature	of	the	time	machine	that	came	in	leopard	.	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	,	you	can	go	back	and	you	can	look	at	the	entire	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	your	computer	,	and	find	 every 	 thing 	 	you	've	lost	,	and	i	 love 	 d 	 	it	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	if	we	built	a	time	machine	for	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	going	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	we	go	 forward 	 s 	 	.
can	we	find	out	what	's	going	to	happen	to	you	,	so	that	you	can	 may 	 be 	 	change	it	?	``
so	,	we	did	.	we	took	all	the	 patient 	 s 	 	like	humberto	,	that	's	the	apple	 back 	 ground 	 	,	we	stole	that	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	have	time	to	build	our	own	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	app	by	the	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
and	you	take	 t 	 hose 	 	data	,	and	we	find	the	 patient 	 s 	 	like	him	,	and	we	 br 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	data	together	.	and	we	 br 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 histo 	 ries 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	then	we	say	,	``	well	how	do	we	line	them	all	up	?	``
so	,	we	line	them	all	up	so	they	go	together	around	the	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 point 	 s 	 	,	 integrate 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	we	know	about	the	patient	.
full	information	,	the	entire	course	of	 the 	 ir 	 	disease	.
and	that	's	what	is	going	to	happen	to	humberto	,	 un 	 less 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	he	took	 lith 	 ium 	 	,	and	he	went	down	the	line	.
and	it	 work 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	every	time	.
now	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	are	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
but	 al 	 most 	 	all	the	time	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	.	it	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
so	,	we	could	n't	run	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	,	we	could	n't	figure	it	out	.
but	we	could	see	 whet 	 her 	 	it	was	going	to	work	for	humberto	.
and	 yea 	 h 	 	,	all	the	 clinic 	 ians 	 	in	the	audience	will	talk	about	power	and	all	the	standard	 dev 	 iation 	 	.	we	'll	do	that	 lat 	 er 	 	.
but	here	is	the	answer	of	the	mean	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	 lith 	 ium 	 	.
these	are	all	the	 patient 	 s 	 	that	 start 	 ed 	 	 lith 	 ium 	 	.
it	's	the	intent	to	treat	 curv 	 e 	 	.
you	can	see	here	,	the	blue	 dot 	 s 	 	on	the	top	,	the	light	 one 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	people	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	in	pnas	that	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	on	.	and	the	red	 one 	 s 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	,	the	pink	 one 	 s 	 	on	the	bottom	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	you	did	n't	want	to	be	.
and	the	 one 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	are	all	of	our	 patient 	 s 	 	from	the	start	of	 lith 	 ium 	 	at	time	zero	,	going	forward	,	and	then	going	 back 	 ward 	 	.
so	,	you	can	see	we	 match 	 ed 	 	them	 perfect 	 ly 	 	,	 perfect 	 ly 	 	.
 terrify 	 ing 	 ly 	 	accurate	 match 	 ing 	 	.
and	going	forward	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	want	to	be	a	 lith 	 ium 	 	patient	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	--	not	 significant 	 ly 	 	,	but	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.	you	do	n't	want	to	be	a	 lith 	 ium 	 	patient	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
but	you	know	,	a	lot	of	people	 drop 	 ped 	 	out	,	the	trial	,	there	is	too	much	drop	out	.
can	we	do	the	even	 hard 	 er 	 	thing	?	can	we	go	to	the	 patient 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	stay	on	 lith 	 ium 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	better	?
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	our	control	algorithm	,	are	 t 	 hose 	 	69	 patient 	 s 	 	--	by	the	way	,	you	'll	notice	that	's	four	 time 	 s 	 	the	number	of	 patient 	 s 	 	in	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	--	can	we	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	can	we	match	them	with	our	time	machine	to	the	other	 patient 	 s 	 	that	are	just	like	them	,	and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?	``
even	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 believ 	 ed 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	better	 match 	 ed 	 	the	 control 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	.	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	little	lines	?	that	's	the	power	.
so	,	we	--	i	ca	n't	tell	you	 lith 	 ium 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.	i	ca	n't	tell	you	that	if	you	did	it	at	a	 high 	 er 	 	dose	or	if	you	run	the	 stud 	 y 	 	proper	--	i	can	tell	you	that	for	 t 	 hose 	 	69	people	that	took	 lith 	 ium 	 	,	they	did	n't	do	any	better	than	the	people	that	 we 	 re 	 	just	like	them	,	just	like	me	,	and	that	we	had	the	power	to	detect	that	at	about	a	quarter	of	the	 strength 	 s 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	in	the	 initi 	 al 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	.
we	did	that	one	year	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	time	when	the	first	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	funded	by	the	nih	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	for	 f 	 util 	 ity 	 	last	week	,	and	 announce 	 d 	 	it	.
so	,	remember	i	told	you	about	my	brother	's	stem	cell	transplant	.
i	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 k 	 new 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	put	100	million	 cell 	 s 	 	in	his	cisterna	 magn 	 a 	 	,	in	his	 lum 	 bar 	 	cord	,	and	 fill 	 ed 	 	out	the	irbs	and	did	all	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	and	i	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 k 	 new 	 	.
how	did	i	not	know	?
i	mean	,	i	did	n't	know	what	was	going	to	happen	to	him	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	tim	,	who	is	the	quant	in	our	group	--	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 search 	 ed 	 	for	about	a	year	to	find	 some 	 one 	 	who	could	do	the	sort	of	math	and	 statistic 	 s 	 	and	 model 	 ing 	 	in	 health 	 care 	 	,	could	n't	find	 any 	 body 	 	.	so	,	we	went	to	the	finance	industry	.
and	there	are	these	 guy 	 s 	 	who	used	to	model	the	future	of	interest	rates	,	and	all	that	kind	of	stuff	.
and	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.	so	,	we	 hire 	 d 	 	one	.
we	 hire 	 d 	 	them	,	set	them	up	,	 assist 	 ing 	 	at	lab	.
i	i.m	.	him	 thing 	 s 	 	.	that	's	the	way	i	communicate	with	him	,	is	like	a	little	guy	in	a	box	.	i	i.	m.	ed	tim	.	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	tim	can	you	tell	me	 whet 	 her 	 	my	brother	's	stem	cell	transplant	 work 	 ed 	 	or	not	?	``
and	he	 s 	 ent 	 	me	 th 	 is 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	was	that	little	 out 	 lier 	 s 	 	there	.	you	see	that	guy	that	lived	a	long	time	?
we	have	to	go	talk	to	him	.	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'd	like	to	know	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	went	different	.
but	my	brother	did	n't	.	my	brother	went	straight	down	the	line	.
it	 on 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	about	12	 month 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	first	version	of	the	time	machine	.
first	time	we	ever	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	.	we	'll	try	to	get	it	better	 lat 	 er 	 	but	12	 month 	 s 	 	so	far	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	.
you	look	at	the	 patient 	 s 	 	,	you	can	drill	in	all	the	 control 	 s 	 	,	you	can	look	at	them	,	you	can	ask	them	.
and	i	found	a	woman	that	had	--	we	found	her	,	she	was	odd	 be 	 cause 	 	she	had	data	after	she	 di 	 ed 	 	.
and	her	husband	had	come	in	and	 enter 	 ed 	 	her	last	functional	 score 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 k 	 new 	 	how	much	she	 car 	 ed 	 	.

i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	these	people	,	 year 	 s 	 	after	my	brother	had	 di 	 ed 	 	,	 help 	 ed 	 	me	answer	the	question	about	 whet 	 her 	 	an	operation	i	did	,	and	 s 	 pent 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 work 	 ed 	 	or	not	.
