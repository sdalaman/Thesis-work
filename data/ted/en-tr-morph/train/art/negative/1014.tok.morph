so	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	work	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	why	people	ca	n't	seem	to	get	work	 d 	 one 	 	at	work	,	which	is	a	problem	we	all	kind	of	have	.
but	let	's	,	sort	of	,	start	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
so	we	have	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	non	-	 profit 	 s 	 	and	 char 	 ities 	 	and	all	these	 group 	 s 	 	that	have	 employ 	 ees 	 	or	 volunteer 	 s 	 	of	some	sort	.
and	they	expect	these	people	who	work	for	them	to	do	great	work	--	i	would	hope	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	good	work	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	's	good	work	--	 hope 	 fully 	 	great	work	.
and	so	what	they	 typical 	 ly 	 	do	is	they	decide	that	all	these	people	need	to	come	together	in	one	place	to	do	that	work	.
so	a	company	,	or	a	 char 	 ity 	 	,	or	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	of	any	kind	,	they	 typical 	 ly 	 	--	 un 	 less 	 	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	africa	,	if	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	do	that	--	most	people	have	to	go	to	an	 off 	 ice 	 	every	day	.
and	so	these	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	they	build	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	.
they	go	out	and	they	buy	a	building	,	or	they	rent	a	building	,	or	they	lease	some	space	,	and	they	fill	the	space	with	stuff	.
they	fill	it	with	 table 	 s 	 	,	or	 desk 	 s 	 	,	 chair 	 s 	 	,	computer	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	 inter 	 net 	 	access	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	 f 	 ridge 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	few	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	expect	 the 	 ir 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	to	come	to	that	location	every	day	to	do	great	work	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 reason 	 able 	 	to	ask	that	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	talk	to	people	and	even	question	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	you	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	where	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	go	when	you	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	?
you	'll	find	out	that	people	do	n't	say	what	 business 	 es 	 	think	they	would	say	.
if	you	ask	people	the	question	:	where	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	go	when	you	need	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	?
 typical 	 ly 	 	you	get	three	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 answer 	 s 	 	.
one	is	kind	of	a	place	or	a	location	or	a	room	.
 an 	 other 	 	one	is	a	moving	object	and	a	third	is	a	time	.
so	here	's	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
when	i	ask	people	--	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	 th 	 is 	 	question	for	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	--	i	ask	them	,	``	where	do	you	go	when	you	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	?	``
i	'll	hear	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	the	porch	,	the	deck	,	the	kitchen	.
i	'll	hear	 thing 	 s 	 	like	an	extra	room	in	the	house	,	the	 base 	 ment 	 	,	the	coffee	shop	,	the	library	.
and	then	you	'll	hear	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	train	,	a	plane	,	a	car	--	so	,	the	commute	.
and	then	you	'll	hear	people	say	,	``	well	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	where	i	am	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	early	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	or	 re 	 ally 	 	late	at	night	or	on	the	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	.	``
you	 al 	 most 	 	never	hear	 some 	 one 	 	say	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
but	 business 	 es 	 	are	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	money	on	 th 	 is 	 	place	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 	,	and	they	're	making	people	go	to	it	all	the	time	,	yet	people	do	n't	do	work	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
what	is	that	about	?
why	is	that	?
why	is	that	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
and	what	you	find	out	is	that	,	if	you	dig	a	little	bit	 deep 	 er 	 	,	you	find	out	that	people	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	--	people	go	to	work	,	and	they	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 work 	 day 	 	for	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	``	work	 moment 	 s 	 	.	``
that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
you	do	n't	have	a	 work 	 day 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.	you	have	work	 moment 	 s 	 	.
it	's	like	the	front	door	of	the	 off 	 ice 	 	is	like	a	cuisinart	,	and	you	walk	in	and	your	day	is	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	to	bits	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	15	 minute 	 s 	 	here	and	30	 minute 	 s 	 	there	,	and	then	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 happen 	 s 	 	and	you	're	 pull 	 ed 	 	off	your	work	,	and	you	've	got	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	then	you	have	20	 minute 	 s 	 	,	then	it	's	lunch	.
then	you	have	 some 	 thing 	 	else	to	do	.
then	you	've	got	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 one 	 	 pull 	 s 	 	you	 a 	 side 	 	and	 ask 	 s 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	and	before	you	know	it	,	it	's	5	 p.m 	 . 	 	,	and	you	look	back	on	the	day	,	and	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	you	did	n't	get	 any 	 thing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
i	mean	,	we	've	all	 be 	 en 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	 prob 	 ably 	 	went	through	it	 yester 	 day 	 	,	or	the	day	before	,	or	the	day	before	that	.
you	look	back	on	your	day	,	and	you	're	like	,	i	got	 noth 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	was	at	work	.
i	 s 	 at 	 	at	my	desk	.	i	used	my	expensive	computer	.
i	used	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	they	told	me	to	use	.
i	went	to	these	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	go	to	.
i	did	these	 con 	 ference 	 	 call 	 s 	 	.	i	did	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
but	i	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	just	did	 task 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 meaning 	 ful 	 	work	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	what	you	find	is	that	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	creative	people	--	 design 	 ers 	 	,	 programm 	 ers 	 	,	 writer 	 s 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 think 	 ers 	 	--	that	people	 re 	 ally 	 	need	long	 stretch 	 es 	 	of	 un 	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	time	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
you	can	not	ask	 some 	 body 	 	to	be	creative	in	15	 minute 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	a	problem	.
you	might	have	a	quick	idea	,	but	to	be	in	deep	thought	about	a	problem	and	 re 	 ally 	 	consider	a	problem	 care 	 fully 	 	,	you	need	long	 stretch 	 es 	 	of	 un 	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	time	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 work 	 day 	 	is	 typical 	 ly 	 	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	have	ever	had	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	?
how	about	seven	 hour 	 s 	 	?
six	?	five	?	four	?
when	's	the	last	time	you	had	three	 hour 	 s 	 	to	 your 	 self 	 	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	?
two	 hour 	 s 	 	?	one	,	 may 	 be 	 	?
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	long	 stretch 	 es 	 	of	 un 	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	time	at	an	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	people	 choos 	 e 	 	to	do	work	at	home	,	or	they	might	go	to	the	 off 	 ice 	 	,	but	they	might	go	to	the	 off 	 ice 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	early	in	the	day	,	or	late	at	night	when	no	one	's	around	,	or	they	stick	around	after	 every 	 one 	 	's	left	,	or	they	go	in	on	the	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	,	or	they	get	work	 d 	 one 	 	on	the	plane	,	or	they	get	work	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	car	or	in	the	train	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	no	 distract 	 ions 	 	.
now	,	there	are	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 distract 	 ions 	 	,	but	there	are	n't	the	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 distract 	 ions 	 	that	i	'll	talk	about	in	just	a	minute	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	whole	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	short	 burst 	 s 	 	of	time	to	get	 thing 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	when	you	're	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	is	sleep	.
i	think	that	sleep	and	work	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	related	,	and	it	's	not	just	that	you	can	work	while	you	're	 sleep 	 ing 	 	and	you	can	sleep	while	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	mean	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	about	the	fact	that	sleep	and	work	are	 phase 	 d 	 	-	based	,	or	stage	-	based	,	 event 	 s 	 	.
so	sleep	is	about	sleep	 phase 	 s 	 	,	or	 stage 	 s 	 	--	some	people	call	them	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
there	's	five	of	them	,	and	in	order	to	get	to	the	 re 	 ally 	 	deep	 one 	 s 	 	,	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	go	through	the	early	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	're	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	while	you	're	going	through	the	early	 one 	 s 	 	--	if	 some 	 one 	 	 bump 	 s 	 	you	in	bed	,	or	if	there	's	a	sound	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	--	you	do	n't	just	pick	up	where	you	left	off	.
if	you	're	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	and	 wok 	 en 	 	up	,	you	have	to	start	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	you	have	to	go	back	a	few	 phase 	 s 	 	and	start	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	what	 end 	 s 	 	up	 happen 	 ing 	 	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	might	have	 day 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	where	you	wake	up	at	eight	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	or	seven	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	or	 when 	 ever 	 	you	get	up	,	and	you	're	like	,	man	,	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	sleep	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
i	did	the	sleep	thing	--	i	went	to	bed	,	i	laid	down	--	but	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	sleep	.
people	say	you	go	to	sleep	,	but	you	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	go	to	sleep	,	you	go	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	sleep	.
it	just	 take 	 s 	 	a	while	.	you	've	got	to	go	through	these	 phase 	 s 	 	and	stuff	,	and	if	you	're	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	,	you	do	n't	sleep	well	.
so	how	do	we	expect	--	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 one 	 	here	expect	 some 	 one 	 	to	sleep	well	if	they	're	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	all	night	?
i	do	n't	think	 any 	 one 	 	would	say	 y 	 es 	 	.
why	do	we	expect	people	to	work	well	if	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	all	day	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	?
how	can	we	possibly	expect	people	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	job	if	they	're	going	to	the	 off 	 ice 	 	to	be	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	?
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	seem	like	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	sense	to	me	.
so	what	are	these	 interrupt 	 ions 	 	that	happen	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	that	do	n't	happen	at	other	 place 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	in	other	 place 	 s 	 	,	you	can	have	 interrupt 	 ions 	 	,	like	,	you	can	have	the	tv	,	or	you	could	go	for	a	walk	,	or	there	's	a	 f 	 ridge 	 	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	,	or	you	've	got	your	own	couch	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	to	do	.
and	if	you	talk	to	certain	 manage 	 rs 	 	,	they	'll	tell	you	that	they	do	n't	want	 the 	 ir 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	work	at	home	 be 	 cause 	 	of	these	 distract 	 ions 	 	.
they	'll	 al 	 so 	 	say	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	'll	 al 	 so 	 	say	,	``	well	,	if	i	ca	n't	see	the	person	,	how	do	i	know	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	?	``
which	is	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	of	course	,	but	that	's	one	of	the	 excuse 	 s 	 	that	 manage 	 rs 	 	give	.
and	i	'm	one	of	these	 manage 	 rs 	 	.
i	understand	.	i	know	how	 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	.
we	all	have	to	improve	on	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.
but	 often 	 time 	 s 	 	they	'll	cite	 distract 	 ions 	 	.
``	i	ca	n't	let	 some 	 one 	 	work	at	home	.
they	'll	watch	tv	.	they	'll	do	 th 	 is 	 	other	thing	.	``
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 t 	 hose 	 	are	n't	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 distract 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	are	voluntary	 distract 	 ions 	 	.
you	decide	when	you	want	to	be	 distract 	 ed 	 	by	the	tv	.
you	decide	when	you	want	to	turn	 some 	 thing 	 	on	.
you	decide	when	you	want	to	go	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	or	go	for	a	walk	.
at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	,	most	of	the	 interrupt 	 ions 	 	and	 distract 	 ions 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	cause	people	not	to	get	work	 d 	 one 	 	are	 in 	 voluntary 	 	.
so	let	's	go	through	a	couple	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
now	,	 manage 	 rs 	 	and	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	will	often	have	you	think	that	the	real	 distract 	 ions 	 	at	work	are	 thing 	 s 	 	like	facebook	and	twitter	and	youtube	and	other	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	,	and	in	fact	,	they	'll	go	so	far	 a 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	ban	these	 s 	 ites 	 	at	work	.
some	of	you	may	work	at	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	ca	n't	get	to	these	certain	 s 	 ites 	 	.
i	mean	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	?	what	the	hell	is	going	on	here	?
you	ca	n't	go	to	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	at	work	,	and	that	's	the	problem	,	that	's	why	people	are	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	work	 d 	 one 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	going	to	facebook	and	they	're	going	to	twitter	?
that	's	kind	of	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.	it	's	a	total	decoy	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	's	facebook	and	twitter	and	youtube	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	just	modern	-	day	smoke	 break 	 s 	 	.
no	one	 car 	 ed 	 	about	 lett 	 ing 	 	people	take	a	smoke	break	for	15	 minute 	 s 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	so	why	 do 	 es 	 	 every 	 one 	 	care	about	 some 	 one 	 	going	to	facebook	here	and	there	,	or	twitter	here	and	there	,	or	youtube	here	and	there	?
 t 	 hose 	 	are	n't	the	real	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
the	real	 problem 	 s 	 	are	what	i	like	to	call	the	m	&	ms	,	the	 manage 	 rs 	 	and	the	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	real	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	modern	 off 	 ice 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	 thing 	 s 	 	do	n't	get	 d 	 one 	 	at	work	--	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	m	&	ms	.
now	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	,	if	you	listen	to	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	people	talk	about	 do 	 ing 	 	work	--	like	at	home	,	or	in	a	car	,	or	on	a	plane	,	or	late	at	night	,	or	early	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	you	do	n't	find	 manage 	 rs 	 	and	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
you	find	a	lot	of	other	 distract 	 ions 	 	,	but	you	do	n't	find	 manage 	 rs 	 	and	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
so	these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	do	n't	find	 else 	 where 	 	,	but	you	do	find	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	 manage 	 rs 	 	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	people	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	job	it	is	to	interrupt	people	.
that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	what	 manage 	 rs 	 	are	for	.	they	're	for	 interrupt 	 ing 	 	people	.
they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	do	the	work	,	so	they	have	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	 every 	 one 	 	else	is	 do 	 ing 	 	the	work	,	which	is	an	 interrupt 	 ion 	 	.
and	we	have	a	lot	of	 manage 	 rs 	 	in	the	world	now	,	and	there	's	a	lot	of	people	in	the	world	now	,	and	there	's	a	lot	of	 interrupt 	 ions 	 	in	the	world	now	 be 	 cause 	 	of	these	 manage 	 rs 	 	.
they	have	to	check	in	:	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	how	's	it	going	?
show	me	what	's	up	,	``	and	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	and	they	keep	 interrupt 	 ing 	 	you	at	the	wrong	time	,	while	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	they	're	 pay 	 ing 	 	you	to	do	,	they	tend	to	interrupt	you	.
that	's	kind	of	bad	.
but	what	's	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	is	the	thing	that	 manage 	 rs 	 	do	most	of	all	,	which	is	call	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	just	toxic	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	 poison 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	at	work	.
we	all	know	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	true	,	and	you	would	never	see	a	 spontane 	 ous 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	by	 employ 	 ees 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	that	way	.
the	 manage 	 r 	 	 call 	 s 	 	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	so	the	 employ 	 ees 	 	can	all	come	together	,	and	it	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	thing	to	do	to	people	--	is	to	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	look	,	we	're	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	10	people	together	right	now	and	have	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
i	do	n't	care	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
just	,	you	've	got	to	stop	 do 	 ing 	 	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	so	you	can	have	 th 	 is 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.	``
i	mean	,	what	are	the	 chance 	 s 	 	that	all	10	people	are	ready	to	stop	?
what	if	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
what	if	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	work	?
all	of	a	sudden	you	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	that	they	have	to	stop	 do 	 ing 	 	that	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
so	they	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	room	,	they	get	together	,	and	they	talk	about	stuff	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	 usual 	 ly 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	n't	work	.
 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 place 	 s 	 	to	go	to	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
but	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 pro 	 create 	 	.
so	one	 meet 	 ing 	 	 tend 	 s 	 	to	lead	to	 an 	 other 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	and	 tend 	 s 	 	to	lead	to	 an 	 other 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	often	too	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	the	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	to	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	often	think	of	a	one	-	hour	 meet 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	one	-	hour	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	but	that	's	not	true	,	 un 	 less 	 	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	person	in	that	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
if	there	are	10	people	in	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	a	10	-	hour	 meet 	 ing 	 	;	it	's	not	a	one	-	hour	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	10	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 product 	 ivity 	 	taken	from	the	rest	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	one	one	-	hour	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	 handle 	 d 	 	by	two	or	three	people	 talk 	 ing 	 	for	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	,	there	's	a	long	 schedule 	 d 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 schedule 	 d 	 	the	way	 soft 	 ware 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	which	is	in	 increment 	 s 	 	of	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	or	30	 minute 	 s 	 	,	or	an	hour	.
you	do	n't	schedule	an	eight	-	hour	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	 out 	 look 	 	.
you	ca	n't	.	i	do	n't	even	know	if	you	can	.
you	can	go	15	 minute 	 s 	 	or	30	 minute 	 s 	 	or	45	 minute 	 s 	 	or	an	hour	.
and	so	we	tend	to	fill	these	 time 	 s 	 	up	when	 thing 	 s 	 	should	 re 	 ally 	 	go	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 manage 	 rs 	 	are	two	major	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 business 	 es 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	to	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	do	n't	exist	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
so	i	have	some	 suggest 	 ions 	 	to	 re 	 med 	 y 	 	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
what	can	 manage 	 rs 	 	do	--	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	 manage 	 rs 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	--	what	can	they	do	to	make	the	 off 	 ice 	 	a	better	place	for	people	to	work	,	so	it	's	not	the	last	resort	,	but	it	's	the	first	resort	?
it	's	that	people	start	to	say	,	``	when	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	get	stuff	 d 	 one 	 	,	i	go	to	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	are	well	 equi 	 pped 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	should	be	there	for	them	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	work	,	but	they	do	n't	want	to	go	there	right	now	,	so	how	do	we	change	that	?
i	have	three	 suggest 	 ions 	 	i	'll	share	with	you	 guy 	 s 	 	.
i	have	about	three	 minute 	 s 	 	,	so	that	'll	fit	 perfect 	 ly 	 	.
we	've	all	heard	of	the	casual	friday	thing	.
i	do	n't	know	if	people	still	do	that	.
but	how	about	``	no	-	talk	thursdays	?	``
how	about	--	pick	one	thursday	once	a	month	and	cut	that	day	in	half	and	just	say	the	afternoon	--	i	'll	make	it	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	for	you	.
so	just	the	afternoon	,	one	thursday	.
the	first	thursday	of	the	month	--	just	the	afternoon	--	 no 	 body 	 	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	can	talk	to	each	other	.
just	silence	,	that	's	it	.
and	what	you	'll	find	is	that	a	tremendous	amount	of	work	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	when	no	one	 talk 	 s 	 	to	each	other	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	when	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	stuff	 d 	 one 	 	,	is	when	no	one	's	 both 	 er 	 ing 	 	them	,	when	no	one	's	 interrupt 	 ing 	 	them	.
and	you	can	give	 some 	 one 	 	--	giving	 some 	 one 	 	four	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	time	is	the	best	gift	you	can	give	 any 	 body 	 	at	work	.
it	's	better	than	a	computer	.
it	's	better	than	a	new	monitor	.	it	's	better	than	new	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	people	 typical 	 ly 	 	use	.
giving	them	four	 hour 	 s 	 	of	quiet	time	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	is	going	to	be	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	.
and	if	you	try	that	,	i	think	you	'll	find	that	you	agree	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	you	can	do	it	more	often	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	every	other	week	,	or	every	week	,	once	a	week	,	 afternoon 	 s 	 	no	one	can	talk	to	each	other	.
that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	'll	find	will	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	work	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	you	can	try	is	 s 	 witch 	 ing 	 	from	active	communication	and	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	like	face	-	to	-	face	stuff	,	 tap 	 ping 	 	people	on	the	shoulder	,	 say 	 ing 	 	hi	to	them	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	replace	that	with	more	 pass 	 ive 	 	 model 	 s 	 	of	communication	,	using	 thing 	 s 	 	like	email	and	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	,	or	 collabor 	 ation 	 	 product 	 s 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
now	some	people	might	say	email	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 distract 	 ing 	 	and	i.m	.	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 distract 	 ing 	 	,	and	these	other	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 distract 	 ing 	 	,	but	they	're	 distract 	 ing 	 	at	a	time	of	your	own	choice	and	your	own	 choos 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	quit	the	email	app	;	you	ca	n't	quit	your	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	.
you	can	quit	i.m	.	;	you	ca	n't	hide	your	 manage 	 r 	 	.
you	can	put	these	 thing 	 s 	 	away	,	and	then	you	can	be	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	on	your	own	schedule	,	at	your	own	time	,	when	you	're	 avail 	 able 	 	,	when	you	're	ready	to	go	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	work	,	like	sleep	,	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 phase 	 s 	 	.
so	you	're	going	to	be	kind	of	going	up	and	 do 	 ing 	 	some	work	,	and	then	you	're	going	to	come	down	from	that	work	,	and	then	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	time	to	check	that	email	,	or	check	that	i.m	.
and	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	that	 urge 	 nt 	 	that	need	to	happen	,	that	need	to	be	 answer 	 ed 	 	right	 th 	 is 	 	second	.
so	if	you	're	a	 manage 	 r 	 	,	start	 encourag 	 ing 	 	people	to	use	more	 thing 	 s 	 	like	i.m	.	and	email	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 some 	 one 	 	else	can	put	away	and	then	get	back	to	you	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	schedule	.
and	the	last	 suggest 	 ion 	 	i	have	is	that	,	if	you	do	have	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	coming	up	,	if	you	have	the	power	,	just	cancel	.	just	cancel	that	next	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	's	friday	--	so	monday	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	people	have	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	monday	.
just	do	n't	have	it	.
i	do	n't	mean	move	it	;	i	mean	just	 er 	 ase 	 	it	from	 memor 	 y 	 	,	it	's	gone	.
and	you	'll	find	out	that	 every 	 thing 	 	will	be	just	fine	.
all	these	 discuss 	 ions 	 	and	 decision 	 s 	 	you	thought	you	had	to	make	at	 th 	 is 	 	one	time	at	9	 a.m 	 . 	 	on	monday	,	just	forget	about	them	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	will	be	just	fine	.
people	have	a	more	open	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	,	and	you	'll	find	out	that	 may 	 be 	 	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	you	thought	you	had	to	do	,	you	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	do	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	just	three	quick	 suggest 	 ions 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	you	 guy 	 s 	 	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	hope	that	some	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	 pro 	 voc 	 ative 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	for	 manage 	 rs 	 	and	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	and	business	 owner 	 s 	 	and	 organize 	 rs 	 	and	people	who	are	in	charge	of	other	people	to	think	about	 lay 	 ing 	 	off	a	little	bit	and	giving	people	some	more	time	to	get	some	work	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	i	think	it	'll	all	pay	off	in	the	end	.
so	 thank 	 s 	 	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
