my	name	is	joshua	walters	.
i	'm	a	 perform 	 er 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 perform 	 er 	 	,	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	i	 re 	 frame 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	positive	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 crazi 	 er 	 	i	get	 on 	 stage 	 	,	the	more	 entertain 	 ing 	 	i	 be 	 come 	 	.
when	i	was	16	in	san	francisco	,	i	had	my	 break 	 through 	 	 man 	 ic 	 	episode	in	which	i	thought	i	was	jesus	christ	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	thought	that	was	 scar 	 y 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	's	no	amount	of	 drug 	 s 	 	you	can	take	that	can	get	you	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	think	you	're	jesus	christ	.
i	was	 s 	 ent 	 	to	a	place	,	a	psych	ward	,	and	in	the	psych	ward	,	 every 	 one 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	one	-	man	show	.
there	's	no	audience	like	 th 	 is 	 	to	 just 	 ify 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 rehears 	 al 	 	time	.
they	're	just	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	.
one	day	they	'll	get	here	.
now	when	i	got	out	,	i	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	and	i	was	 give 	 n 	 	 medic 	 ations 	 	by	a	psychiatrist	.
``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	josh	,	why	do	n't	we	give	you	some	--	why	do	n't	we	give	you	some	zyprexa	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	mmhmm	?
at	 l 	 east 	 	that	's	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	on	my	pen	.	``
some	of	you	are	in	the	field	,	i	can	see	.
i	can	feel	your	noise	.
the	first	half	of	high	school	was	the	struggle	of	the	 man 	 ic 	 	episode	,	and	the	second	half	was	the	 over 	 medic 	 ations 	 	of	these	 drug 	 s 	 	,	where	i	was	 sleep 	 ing 	 	through	high	school	.
the	second	half	was	just	one	big	nap	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	,	in	class	.
when	i	got	out	i	had	a	choice	.
i	could	either	 den 	 y 	 	my	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	or	embrace	my	mental	 skill 	 ness 	 	.
there	's	a	 move 	 ment 	 	going	on	right	now	to	 re 	 frame 	 	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	positive	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	the	 hypo 	 man 	 ic 	 	edge	part	of	it	.
now	if	you	do	n't	know	what	 hypo 	 mania 	 	is	,	it	's	like	an	engine	that	's	out	of	control	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	ferrari	engine	,	with	no	 break 	 s 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 speaker 	 s 	 	here	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	in	the	audience	,	have	that	creative	edge	,	if	you	know	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
you	're	driven	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	told	you	is	 im 	 possible 	 	.
and	there	's	a	book	--	john	gartner	.
john	gartner	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 hypo 	 man 	 ic 	 	edge	``	in	which	christopher	columbus	and	ted	turner	and	steve	 job 	 s 	 	and	all	these	business	 mind 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	edge	to	compete	.
a	different	book	was	written	not	too	long	ago	in	the	mid	-	90s	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 touch 	 ed 	 	with	fire	``	by	kay	redfield	jamison	in	which	it	was	 look 	 ed 	 	at	in	a	creative	sense	in	which	mozart	and	beethoven	and	van	gogh	all	have	 th 	 is 	 	 man 	 ic 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	with	.
some	of	them	 commit 	 ted 	 	 su 	 icide 	 	.
so	it	was	n't	all	the	good	side	of	the	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
now	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	.
and	there	was	an	article	written	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	september	2010	,	that	 state 	 d 	 	:	``	just	 man 	 ic 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.	``
just	be	 man 	 ic 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	in	which	 invest 	 ors 	 	who	are	looking	for	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	that	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	spectrum	--	you	know	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	not	 may 	 be 	 	full	 bi 	 polar 	 	,	but	they	're	in	the	 bi 	 polar 	 	spectrum	--	where	on	one	side	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	think	you	're	jesus	,	and	on	the	other	side	 may 	 be 	 	they	just	make	you	a	lot	of	money	.
your	call	.	your	call	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	's	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	middle	.
 every 	 one 	 	's	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	middle	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	,	you	know	,	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	crazy	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	a	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	you	're	crazy	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	it	just	 mean 	 s 	 	you	're	more	sensitive	to	what	most	people	ca	n't	see	or	feel	.
 may 	 be 	 	no	one	's	 re 	 ally 	 	crazy	.
 every 	 one 	 	is	just	a	little	bit	mad	.
how	much	 depend 	 s 	 	on	where	you	fall	in	the	spectrum	.
how	much	 depend 	 s 	 	on	how	 luck 	 y 	 	you	are	.
thank	you	.
