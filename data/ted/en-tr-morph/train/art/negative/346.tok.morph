we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	put	the	best	we	have	to	 off 	 er 	 	 with 	 in 	 	reach	of	our	children	.
if	we	do	n't	do	that	,	we	're	going	to	get	the	generation	we	deserve	.
they	're	going	to	learn	from	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	they	have	around	them	.
and	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	now	the	elite	,	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 librarian 	 s 	 	,	 professional 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	a	bunch	of	our	 activ 	 ities 	 	are	,	in	fact	,	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	best	we	have	to	 off 	 er 	 	 with 	 in 	 	reach	of	 t 	 hose 	 	around	us	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	 broad 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	.
i	'm	going	to	start	and	end	 th 	 is 	 	talk	with	a	couple	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 carv 	 ed 	 	in	stone	.
one	is	what	's	on	the	boston	public	library	.
 carv 	 ed 	 	above	 the 	 ir 	 	door	is	,	``	free	to	all	.	``
it	's	kind	of	an	inspiring	 state 	 ment 	 	,	and	i	'll	go	back	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'm	a	librarian	,	and	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	 br 	 ing 	 	all	of	the	 work 	 s 	 	of	knowledge	to	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	want	to	read	it	.
and	the	idea	of	using	technology	is	perfect	for	us	.
i	think	we	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	one	-	up	the	greeks	.
it	's	not	easy	to	one	-	up	the	greeks	.	but	with	the	 industrious 	 ness 	 	of	the	egyptians	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	build	the	library	of	alexandria	--	the	idea	of	a	copy	of	every	book	of	all	the	 people 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
the	problem	was	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	to	go	to	alexandria	to	go	to	it	.
on	the	other	hand	,	if	you	did	,	then	great	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	think	we	can	one	-	up	the	greeks	and	 achiev 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	try	to	 argu 	 e 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	point	 to 	 day 	 	:	that	universal	access	to	all	knowledge	is	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	.
so	if	i	'm	 success 	 ful 	 	,	then	you	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	away	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	great	vision	of	 every 	 thing 	 	ever	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	ever	 me 	 ant 	 	for	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	world	that	's	ever	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	access	to	it	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	there	's	 issue 	 s 	 	about	how	money	should	be	 distribut 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	's	still	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	.
but	i	'd	say	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	money	,	and	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	demand	,	so	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	.
but	i	'm	going	to	go	over	the	 techno 	 logical 	 	,	social	and	sort	of	where	are	we	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	to	that	 part 	 icular 	 	vision	.
and	the	way	i	'm	going	to	try	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	do	it	like	the	amazon.com	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	the	 book 	 s 	 	,	music	,	video	and	just	go	step	--	media	type	by	media	type	,	just	go	and	say	,	all	right	,	how	're	we	 do 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	?
so	if	we	start	with	 book 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	sort	of	where	are	we	?
well	,	first	you	have	to	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	engineer	,	scope	the	problem	.	how	big	is	it	?
if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	all	of	the	 publish 	 ed 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	so	that	 any 	 body 	 	could	have	it	 avail 	 able 	 	,	well	,	how	big	a	problem	is	it	?
well	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	,	but	the	largest	print	library	in	the	world	is	the	library	of	congress	.	it	's	26	million	 volume 	 s 	 	,	26	million	 volume 	 s 	 	.
it	is	,	by	far	and	away	,	the	largest	print	library	in	the	world	.
and	a	book	,	if	you	had	a	book	,	is	about	a	 mega 	 byte 	 	,	so	--	you	know	,	if	you	had	it	in	 micro 	 soft 	 	word	.
so	a	 mega 	 byte 	 	,	26	million	 mega 	 byte 	 s 	 	is	26	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	--	it	 go 	 es 	 	mega	-	,	giga	-	,	tera	-	.	26	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	.
26	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	in	a	computer	system	that	's	about	 th 	 is 	 	big	,	on	 s 	 pinning 	 	linux	 drive 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 cost 	 s 	 	about	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	for	the	cost	of	a	house	--	or	around	here	,	a	 gar 	 age 	 	--	you	can	put	,	you	can	have	 s 	 pinning 	 	all	of	the	 word 	 s 	 	in	the	library	of	congress	.
that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	neat	.
then	the	question	is	,	what	do	you	get	?
you	know	,	is	it	worth	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	there	?
do	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	it	 on 	 line 	 	?
some	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	do	is	they	make	book	 read 	 ers 	 	that	allow	you	to	search	 in 	 side 	 	the	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	kind	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
and	you	can	download	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	look	around	them	in	new	and	different	ways	.
and	you	can	get	at	them	 remote 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	happen	to	have	a	 lap 	 top 	 	.
there	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	be	some	of	these	sort	of	page	turn	-	y	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	that	look	a	whole	lot	like	 book 	 s 	 	in	certain	ways	,	and	you	can	search	them	,	make	little	 tab 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	kind	of	cute	--	still	 ver 	 y 	 	book	-	like	--	on	your	 lap 	 top 	 	.
but	i	do	n't	know	,	 read 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	a	 lap 	 top 	 	--	 when 	 ever 	 	i	pull	up	my	 lap 	 top 	 	,	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	like	work	.
i	think	that	's	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	the	kindle	is	so	great	.
i	do	n't	have	to	feel	like	i	'm	at	work	to	read	a	kindle	.
it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	be	a	little	bit	more	 spec 	 ified 	 	.
but	i	have	to	say	that	there	's	 old 	 er 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	i	tend	to	like	.
i	like	the	physical	book	.
and	i	think	we	can	go	and	use	our	technology	to	go	and	 digit 	 ize 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	put	them	on	the	net	,	and	then	download	,	print	them	and	bind	them	,	and	end	up	with	 book 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	we	sort	of	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	how	hard	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	not	be	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	off	to	make	a	 book 	 mobile 	 	.
and	a	 book 	 mobile 	 	--	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	van	with	a	satellite	dish	,	a	 print 	 er 	 	,	 bind 	 er 	 	and	cutter	,	and	 kid 	 s 	 	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 book 	 s 	 	.
it	 cost 	 s 	 	about	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	download	,	print	and	bind	a	normal	,	old	book	.
and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	out	kind	of	nice	looking	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 re 	 ally 	 	good	-	looking	 book 	 s 	 	for	on	the	order	of	one	 pen 	 ny 	 	per	page	,	sort	of	the	 part 	 s 	 	cost	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	the	idea	of	--	 th 	 is 	 	technology	 actual 	 ly 	 	may	end	up	 put 	 ting 	 	 book 	 s 	 	back	in	people	's	 hand 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
there	are	some	other	 book 	 mobile 	 s 	 	running	around	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	eric	eldred	making	 book 	 s 	 	at	walden	pond	--	thoreau	's	 work 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	before	he	got	 kick 	 ed 	 	out	by	the	 park 	 s 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	for	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	the	 book 	 store 	 	there	.
in	india	,	they	've	got	 an 	 other 	 	couple	 book 	 mobile 	 s 	 	running	around	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 open 	 ing 	 	day	at	the	library	of	alexandria	,	the	new	library	of	alexandria	,	in	egypt	.
it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 popular 	 ly 	 	 attend 	 ed 	 	.
and	 kid 	 s 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	a	happy	kid	with	the	first	book	that	he	's	ever	owned	.
so	the	idea	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	technology	to	end	up	with	paper	where	i	can	handle	sort	of	 sound 	 s 	 	a	little	retro	,	but	i	think	it	still	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	place	.
and	 be 	 ing 	 	from	the	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	sort	of	 utopia 	 n 	 	sort	of	world	,	we	thought	,	if	we	can	make	 th 	 is 	 	technology	work	in	 r 	 ural 	 	uganda	,	we	might	have	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	some	 fund 	 ing 	 	from	the	world	bank	to	try	it	out	.
and	we	found	in	about	30	 day 	 s 	 	we	could	go	and	take	a	couple	 folk 	 s 	 	from	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	fly	them	to	uganda	,	buy	a	car	,	set	up	the	first	 inter 	 net 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	at	the	national	library	of	uganda	,	figure	out	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	,	and	get	a	program	going	making	 book 	 s 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	uganda	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	so	 techno 	 logically 	 	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
what	we	found	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	we	did	n't	have	the	right	 book 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 book 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	library	.	we	could	get	it	to	people	,	if	they	're	 digit 	 ized 	 	,	but	we	did	n't	know	how	to	 quit 	 e 	 	get	them	 digit 	 ized 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	thought	the	answer	is	,	 s 	 end 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	so	we	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	that	,	and	i	'll	go	over	that	in	a	moment	.
there	are	some	 new 	 er 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 deliver 	 ing 	 	that	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
one	is	a	print	-	on	-	demand	machine	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	rube	goldberg	machine	.
we	have	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	now	.	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	cool	.
it	's	all	 convey 	 or 	 	belt	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	book	.
and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	espresso	book	machine	,	``	and	in	about	10	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	can	press	a	button	and	make	a	book	.
 some 	 thing 	 	else	i	'm	 quit 	 e 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	domain	,	beyond	these	sort	of	kiosk	-	y	 thing 	 s 	 	where	you	can	get	 book 	 s 	 	on	demand	,	is	some	of	these	new	little	 screen 	 s 	 	that	are	coming	out	.
and	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	mean	to	steal	any	thunder	here	,	but	we	've	gone	and	used	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	be	an	 e 	 - 	 book 	 	 read 	 er 	 	.
so	here	's	one	of	the	beta	 unit 	 s 	 	and	you	can	--	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	-	looking	 e 	 - 	 book 	 	 read 	 er 	 	.
and	we	have	a	quick	hack	that	we	did	to	try	to	put	one	of	our	 book 	 s 	 	on	it	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	200	 dot 	 s 	 	per	inch	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	can	put	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	 book 	 s 	 	on	them	that	look	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
at	200	 dot 	 s 	 	per	inch	,	it	's	kind	of	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	a	300	dot	print	laser	 print 	 er 	 	.
we	're	in	good	 en 	 ough 	 	shape	.
you	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	go	and	read	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
so	the	idea	of	 electron 	 ic 	 	 book 	 s 	 	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	come	about	.
but	how	do	you	go	about	 do 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	?
so	we	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	well	,	let	's	try	out	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 end 	 	 book 	 s 	 	to	india	thing	.
and	there	was	a	project	with	,	funded	by	the	national	science	 found 	 ation 	 	--	 s 	 ent 	 	a	bunch	of	 scanner 	 s 	 	,	and	the	american	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
well	,	they	did	n't	.	they	did	n't	want	to	 s 	 end 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 b 	 ought 	 	100,000	 book 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ent 	 	them	to	india	.
and	then	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	why	you	do	n't	want	to	 s 	 end 	 	 book 	 s 	 	to	india	.
the	 less 	 on 	 	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 s 	 can 	 	your	own	 book 	 s 	 	.
if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	 book 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	to	 s 	 can 	 	them	better	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	they	're	 valu 	 able 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
if	they	're	new	 book 	 s 	 	and	you	can	just	,	you	know	,	butcher	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	could	just	buy	 an 	 other 	 	one	,	that	's	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	deal	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	high	-	quality	 s 	 canning 	 	.
but	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	love	.
but	the	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	a	lot	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 book 	 s 	 	--	about	300,000	now	--	 do 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
the	chinese	did	over	a	million	,	and	the	egyptians	are	about	30,000	.
but	we	 s 	 ent 	 	--	thought	,	ok	,	if	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	let	's	do	it	in	-	library	.
how	do	we	go	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	how	do	we	get	it	down	so	that	it	's	a	cost	point	that	we	could	afford	?
and	we	sort	of	 pick 	 ed 	 	the	price	point	of	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	.
if	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	cost	of	 xerox 	 ing 	 	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	 digit 	 ize 	 	,	ocr	,	package	it	up	,	make	it	so	that	you	could	download	,	print	and	bind	it	--	the	whole	 she 	 bang 	 	--	we	would	have	 achiev 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	.	how	do	we	get	to	10	 cent 	 s 	 	?
and	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	these	robot	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 work 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	--	sort	of	these	auto	-	page	-	 turn 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
if	we	can	have	mars	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	,	you	'd	think	you	could	turn	 page 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	to	turn	 page 	 s 	 	,	and	the	volume	is	n't	there	.
so	 any 	 way 	 	--	so	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	making	our	own	book	scanner	,	and	with	two	digital	,	high	-	grade	,	professional	digital	 camera 	 s 	 	,	controlled	museum	 light 	 ing 	 	,	so	even	if	it	's	a	black	and	white	book	,	you	can	go	and	get	the	proper	 in 	 ton 	 ation 	 	.
so	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	do	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 respect 	 ful 	 	job	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	fax	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	the	idea	is	to	do	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	job	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	going	through	these	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	.
and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	if	we	run	 thing 	 s 	 	in	volume	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	at	the	university	of	toronto	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	,	you	know	,	pay	a	living	wage	.
people	seem	to	love	it	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	a	little	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	but	some	people	kind	of	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	zen	of	it	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	it	's	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	that	you	care	about	,	in	 language 	 s 	 	that	you	can	read	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	job	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	at	 get 	 ting 	 	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	.
so	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	,	300	 page 	 s 	 	in	your	average	book	,	30	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	book	.
the	library	of	congress	,	if	you	did	the	whole	darn	thing	--	26	million	 book 	 s 	 	--	is	about	750	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	right	?
but	a	million	 book 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	would	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	start	,	and	that	would	cost	30	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	that	's	not	that	big	a	bill	.
and	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	is	get	 in 	 to 	 	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	.
we	've	now	got	eight	of	these	 s 	 canning 	 	 center 	 s 	 	in	three	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	are	up	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	.
the	getty	here	is	moving	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	to	the	ucla	,	which	is	where	we	have	one	these	 s 	 canning 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	 s 	 canning 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	out	-	of	-	 copy 	 right 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	which	is	fabulous	.
so	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	 institution 	 al 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
the	thing	we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	the	10	 cent 	 s 	 	.
if	we	can	get	the	10	 cent 	 s 	 	,	all	the	rest	of	it	 flow 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	about	200,000	 book 	 s 	 	.
now	we	're	 s 	 canning 	 	about	15,000	 book 	 s 	 	a	month	,	and	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	gear	up	 an 	 other 	 	factor	of	two	from	there	.
so	all	in	all	,	that	's	going	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
and	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	move	out	of	the	just	out	-	of	-	 copy 	 right 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	out	-	of	-	print	world	.
so	i	think	of	--	we	're	kind	of	going	from	the	out	-	of	-	 copy 	 right 	 	,	library	stuff	,	and	amazon.com	is	coming	from	the	in	-	print	world	.
and	i	think	we	'll	meet	in	the	middle	some	place	,	and	have	the	classic	thing	that	you	have	,	which	is	a	 publish 	 ing 	 	system	and	a	library	system	 work 	 ing 	 	in	parallel	.
and	so	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	up	a	program	to	do	out	-	of	-	print	 work 	 s 	 	,	but	 loan 	 ing 	 	them	.
 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 loan 	 ing 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	 loan 	 ing 	 	out	-	of	-	print	 work 	 s 	 	from	the	boston	public	library	,	the	 wood 	 s 	 	hole	 ocean 	 o 	 graphic 	 	institute	and	a	few	other	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	that	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	program	,	to	try	out	 th 	 is 	 	model	of	where	 do 	 es 	 	a	library	stop	and	where	 do 	 es 	 	the	 book 	 store 	 	take	over	.
so	all	in	all	,	it	's	possible	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	large	scale	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	going	back	over	 micro 	 film 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	that	 on 	 line 	 	.
so	,	we	can	do	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	,	we	're	going	15,000	 book 	 s 	 	a	month	and	we	've	got	about	250,000	 book 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	 count 	 ing 	 	all	the	other	 project 	 s 	 	that	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	add	in	.
so	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 argu 	 e 	 	is	,	 book 	 s 	 	are	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	.
the	idea	of	taking	on	the	whole	ball	of	wax	is	not	that	big	a	deal	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	 cost 	 s 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	low	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	but	one	time	shot	and	we	've	got	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 print 	 ed 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	 on 	 line 	 	.
and	then	,	there	's	business	model	 issue 	 s 	 	about	how	to	try	to	 effective 	 ly 	 	market	it	and	get	it	to	people	.
but	it	is	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	,	 techno 	 logically 	 	and	law	-	wise	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	the	out	of	print	and	out	of	 copy 	 right 	 	,	we	suggest	,	to	be	able	to	get	the	whole	darn	thing	 on 	 line 	 	.
now	let	's	go	for	audio	,	and	i	'm	going	to	go	through	these	.
so	how	much	is	there	?
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	best	we	can	tell	,	there	are	about	two	to	three	million	 dis 	 k 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	--	so	78s	,	long	-	 play 	 ing 	 	 record 	 s 	 	and	cds	--	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	that	's	the	largest	 archiv 	 es 	 	of	 publish 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	sort	of	point	at	.
it	 cost 	 s 	 	about	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	piece	to	go	and	take	a	 dis 	 k 	 	and	put	it	 on 	 line 	 	,	if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	volume	.
but	we	've	found	that	the	 right 	 s 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 thorn 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	 litig 	 ated 	 	area	,	so	we	've	found	that	there	are	 niche 	 s 	 	in	the	music	world	that	are	n't	 serv 	 ed 	 	 terr 	 ibly 	 	well	by	the	classic	commercial	 publish 	 ing 	 	system	.
and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	these	 avail 	 able 	 	by	going	and	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	shelf	space	on	the	net	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cost	you	to	give	 some 	 thing 	 	away	.	right	?
if	you	give	 some 	 thing 	 	to	a	 char 	 ity 	 	or	to	the	public	,	you	get	a	pat	on	the	back	and	a	tax	 don 	 ation 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	on	the	net	,	where	you	can	go	broke	.
if	you	put	up	a	video	of	your	 gar 	 age 	 	band	,	and	it	 start 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	 access 	 ed 	 	,	you	can	lose	your	 guitar 	 s 	 	or	your	house	.
 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	.
so	we	've	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	,	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 band 	 width 	 	,	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	for	free	,	to	 any 	 body 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	share	that	 belong 	 s 	 	in	a	library	.
and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	a	lot	of	 taker 	 s 	 	.	one	is	the	rock	'	n	'	 roller 	 s 	 	.
the	rock	'	n	'	 roller 	 s 	 	had	a	tradition	of	sharing	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 no 	 body 	 	made	any	money	.	you	could	--	concert	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	the	commercial	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	concert	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	by	the	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	dead	.
and	we	get	about	two	or	three	 band 	 s 	 	a	day	 sign 	 ing 	 	up	.
they	give	 per 	 mission 	 	,	and	we	get	about	40	or	50	 concert 	 s 	 	a	day	.
we	have	about	40,000	 concert 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	the	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	dead	ever	did	,	up	on	the	net	,	so	that	people	can	see	it	and	listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	material	.
so	audio	is	possible	to	put	up	,	but	the	 right 	 s 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 thorn 	 y 	 	.
we	've	got	a	lot	of	 collect 	 ions 	 	now	--	a	couple	hundred	thousand	 item 	 s 	 	--	and	it	's	growing	over	time	.
moving	 image 	 s 	 	:	if	you	think	of	 the 	 a 	 tric 	 al 	 	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	,	there	are	not	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	.
 a 	 s 	 	best	we	can	tell	,	there	are	about	150,000	to	200,000	 movie 	 s 	 	ever	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	for	a	large	-	scale	 the 	 a 	 tric 	 al 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.	it	's	just	not	that	 man 	 y 	 	.
but	half	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	indian	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	it	's	 do 	 able 	 	,	but	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	found	about	a	thousand	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	--	to	be	out	of	 copy 	 right 	 	.
so	we	've	 digit 	 ized 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	and	made	 t 	 hose 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
but	we	've	found	that	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 type 	 s 	 	of	 movie 	 s 	 	that	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 een 	 	the	light	of	day	--	 archiv 	 al 	 	 film 	 s 	 	.
we	've	found	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	a	lot	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 film 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	amateur	 film 	 s 	 	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 need 	 ing 	 	a	home	,	a	permanent	home	.
so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	these	 avail 	 able 	 	and	it	's	grown	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	.
we	're	not	 quit 	 e 	 	a	youtube	.
we	 tend 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	-	term	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	can	 re 	 use 	 	and	make	 in 	 to 	 	new	 movie 	 s 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	great	 f 	 un 	 	.
 tele 	 vision 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	 large 	 r 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	 record 	 ing 	 	20	 channel 	 s 	 	of	 tele 	 vision 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
it	's	sort	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	tivo	box	you	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
it	's	about	a	 pet 	 a 	 byte 	 	,	so	far	,	of	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	--	russian	,	chinese	,	japanese	,	iraqi	,	al	jazeera	,	bbc	,	cnn	,	abc	,	cbs	,	nbc	--	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
we	 on 	 ly 	 	put	one	week	up	,	which	is	 most 	 ly 	 	for	cost	 reason 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	9/11	,	sort	of	from	9/11/2001	.	for	one	week	,	what	did	the	world	see	?
cnn	was	 say 	 ing 	 	that	palestinians	 we 	 re 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
 we 	 re 	 	they	?	let	's	look	at	the	palestinian	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	find	out	.
how	can	we	have	critical	 think 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	quote	and	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 compar 	 e 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	?
and	 tele 	 vision 	 	is	 dread 	 fully 	 	 un 	 record 	 ed 	 	and	 un 	 quo 	 table 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	by	jon	stewart	,	who	 do 	 es 	 	a	fabulous	job	.
so	 any 	 way 	 	,	 tele 	 vision 	 	is	,	i	would	suggest	,	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	.
so	15	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	video	hour	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	about	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	150	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	 cell 	 ul 	 oid 	 	hour	,	we	're	able	to	go	and	get	 material 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 ly 	 	and	have	them	up	on	the	net	.
and	we	've	got	,	now	,	a	lot	of	these	 material 	 s 	 	.
so	we	've	got	about	100,000	 piece 	 s 	 	up	there	.
so	 book 	 s 	 	,	music	,	video	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	.	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	50,000	 title 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 most 	 ly 	 	the	 issue 	 s 	 	there	are	legal	 issue 	 s 	 	and	 break 	 ing 	 	copy	 protect 	 ions 	 	.
but	we	've	 work 	 ed 	 	through	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	but	we	've	still	got	real	 problem 	 s 	 	in	washington	.
well	,	we	're	best	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	world	wide	web	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 archiv 	 ing 	 	the	world	wide	web	since	1996	.
we	take	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	of	every	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	all	of	the	 page 	 s 	 	on	it	,	every	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	by	alexa	 inter 	 net 	 	,	which	 don 	 ates 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 archiv 	 e 	 	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	growing	 a 	 long 	 	for	the	last	11	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	a	fantastic	resource	.
and	we	've	made	a	wayback	machine	that	you	can	then	go	and	see	old	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	kind	of	the	way	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
if	you	go	and	search	on	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	google.com	,	the	different	 version 	 s 	 	of	it	that	we	have	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	when	it	was	an	alpha	 re 	 lease 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	at	stanford	.
so	 any 	 way 	 	,	you	've	got	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	idea	of	where	 thing 	 s 	 	came	from	.
 most 	 ly 	 	,	people	want	to	see	 the 	 ir 	 	old	stuff	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	there	's	one	thing	that	we	want	to	learn	from	the	library	of	alexandria	version	one	,	which	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	best	known	for	 burn 	 ing 	 	,	is	,	do	n't	just	have	one	copy	.
so	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	--	we	've	made	 an 	 other 	 	copy	of	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	it	back	in	the	library	of	alexandria	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 archiv 	 e 	 	at	the	library	of	alexandria	.
and	we	now	have	 al 	 so 	 	 an 	 other 	 	copy	building	up	in	amsterdam	.
so	,	we	should	put	it	in	the	san	andreas	fault	line	in	san	francisco	,	flood	zone	in	amsterdam	and	in	the	middle	east	.	right	,	so	 any 	 way 	 	...
so	we	're	 hedg 	 ing 	 	our	 bet 	 s 	 	here	.
if	we	go	and	put	it	in	a	couple	more	 place 	 s 	 	,	i	think	we	'll	be	in	good	shape	.
there	's	a	 politic 	 al 	 	and	social	question	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
is	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	digital	,	is	it	going	to	be	public	or	private	?
there	's	some	large	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	have	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	vision	,	that	are	 do 	 ing 	 	large	-	scale	 digit 	 ization 	 	,	but	they	're	 lock 	 ing 	 	up	the	public	domain	.
the	question	is	,	is	that	the	world	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	live	in	?
what	's	the	role	of	the	public	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	private	 a 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	go	forward	?
how	do	we	go	and	have	a	world	where	we	both	have	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	and	 publish 	 ing 	 	in	the	future	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	 benefit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	growing	up	?
so	universal	access	to	all	knowledge	--	i	think	it	can	be	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 kind 	 	,	like	the	man	on	the	moon	,	or	the	gutenberg	 b 	 ible 	 	,	or	the	library	of	alexandria	.
it	could	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	 remember 	 ed 	 	for	,	for	millennia	,	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	before	,	i	'll	end	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 carv 	 ed 	 	above	the	door	of	the	carnegie	library	.
carnegie	--	one	of	the	great	 capital 	 ists 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	--	 carv 	 ed 	 	above	his	 leg 	 acy 	 	,	``	free	to	the	people	.	``
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
