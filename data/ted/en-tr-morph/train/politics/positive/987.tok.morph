so	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'm	a	 news 	 paper 	 	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	--	 politic 	 al 	 	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	've	heard	about	it	--	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	?
it	's	a	sort	of	paper	-	based	 read 	 er 	 	.
it	's	 light 	 er 	 	than	an	ipad	,	it	's	a	bit	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
you	know	what	they	say	?
they	say	the	print	media	is	 dy 	 ing 	 	--	who	 say 	 s 	 	that	?	well	,	the	media	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	no	news	,	right	?
you	've	read	about	it	 al 	 ready 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	 small 	 er 	 	.
i	know	it	's	a	cliche	,	but	look	,	look	how	small	,	how	 tin 	 y 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	.
and	you	know	the	reason	why	,	of	course	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	technology	--	 yea 	 h 	 	.
any	computer	 design 	 ers 	 	in	the	room	?
 yea 	 h 	 	well	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	making	my	life	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	track	 pad 	 s 	 	used	to	be	round	,	a	nice	round	shape	.
that	 make 	 s 	 	a	good	cartoon	.
but	what	are	you	going	to	do	with	a	flat	track	pad	,	 t 	 hose 	 	square	 thing 	 s 	 	?
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	i	can	do	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	.
well	,	i	know	the	world	is	flat	now	.
that	's	true	.
and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	every	corner	of	the	world	,	the	 poor 	 est 	 	,	the	 remote 	 st 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
every	village	in	africa	now	 ha 	 s 	 	a	cyber	cafe	.
do	n't	go	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	a	frappuccino	there	.
so	we	are	 brid 	 ging 	 	the	digital	divide	.
the	third	world	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	we	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	next	?
well	,	you	've	got	mail	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.
well	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	us	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	you	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	me	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	some	other	 guy 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
you	know	,	these	last	two	 cartoon 	 s 	 	--	i	did	them	live	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	 con 	 ference 	 	in	hanoi	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	used	to	that	in	 commun 	 ist 	 	2.0	vietnam	.
so	i	was	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	live	on	a	wide	screen	--	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 sens 	 ation 	 	--	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	guy	came	to	me	.
he	was	taking	 picture 	 s 	 	of	me	and	of	my	 sketch 	 es 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	,	a	vietnamese	fan	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	he	came	the	second	day	,	i	thought	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	cartoon	lover	.	``
and	on	the	third	day	,	i	 final 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	,	the	guy	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	on	duty	.
so	by	now	,	there	must	be	a	hundred	 picture 	 s 	 	of	me	 smil 	 ing 	 	with	my	 sketch 	 es 	 	in	the	 file 	 s 	 	of	the	vietnamese	police	.
no	,	but	it	's	true	:	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 rock 	 ed 	 	the	music	industry	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	we	 consum 	 e 	 	music	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	old	 en 	 ough 	 	to	remember	,	we	used	to	have	to	go	to	the	store	to	steal	it	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	your	future	 employ 	 er 	 	will	look	at	your	application	.
so	be	 care 	 ful 	 	with	that	facebook	account	--	your	 mom 	 ma 	 	told	you	,	be	 care 	 ful 	 	.
and	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	set	us	free	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	free	wifi	.
but	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 liberate 	 d 	 	us	from	the	 off 	 ice 	 	desk	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	your	life	,	enjoy	it	.
in	short	,	technology	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	they	have	 change 	 d 	 	our	 life 	 style 	 	.
tech	guru	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	man	--	that	a	german	magazine	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 philosoph 	 er 	 	of	the	21st	century	--	they	are	 sha 	 ping 	 	the	way	we	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 sha 	 ping 	 	the	way	we	 consum 	 e 	 	.
they	are	 sha 	 ping 	 	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 desir 	 es 	 	.
you	will	not	like	it	.
and	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	even	 change 	 d 	 	our	relationship	to	god	.
now	i	should	n't	get	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 relig 	 ion 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	may	have	heard	,	make	a	difficult	couple	,	ever	since	that	day	of	2005	,	when	a	bunch	of	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	in	denmark	drew	 cartoon 	 s 	 	that	had	 re 	 percuss 	 ions 	 	all	over	the	world	--	 demonst 	 ration 	 s 	 	,	 fat 	 wa 	 	,	they	 provok 	 ed 	 	violence	.	people	 di 	 ed 	 	in	the	violence	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	so	 sick 	 en 	 ing 	 	;	people	 di 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	--	i	had	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	at	the	time	that	 cartoon 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	used	by	both	 side 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	used	first	by	a	danish	 news 	 paper 	 	,	which	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	point	on	islam	.
a	danish	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	told	me	he	was	one	of	the	24	who	 receiv 	 ed 	 	the	 assign 	 ment 	 	to	draw	the	prophet	--	12	of	them	 re 	 fused 	 	.	did	you	know	that	?
he	told	me	,	``	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	tell	me	what	i	should	draw	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.	``
and	then	,	of	course	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	used	by	 extrem 	 ists 	 	and	 politic 	 ians 	 	on	the	other	side	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	stir	up	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	.
you	know	the	story	.
we	know	that	 cartoon 	 s 	 	can	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
 histo 	 ry 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	,	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	used	by	the	nazis	to	attack	the	jews	.
and	here	we	are	now	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	half	of	the	world	is	 push 	 ing 	 	to	 penal 	 ize 	 	the	offense	to	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	they	call	it	the	 def 	 am 	 ation 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	while	the	other	half	of	the	world	is	 fight 	 ing 	 	back	in	defense	of	 free 	 dom 	 	of	speech	.
so	the	 c 	 lash 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	is	here	,	and	 cartoon 	 s 	 	are	at	the	middle	of	it	?
 th 	 is 	 	got	me	 think 	 ing 	 	.
now	you	see	me	 think 	 ing 	 	at	my	kitchen	table	,	and	since	you	're	in	my	kitchen	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	meet	my	wife	.
in	2006	,	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	after	,	i	went	 iv 	 ory 	 	coast	--	western	africa	.
now	,	talk	of	a	 divid 	 ed 	 	place	--	the	country	was	cut	in	two	.
you	had	a	 rebel 	 lion 	 	in	the	north	,	the	government	in	the	south	--	the	capital	,	abidjan	--	and	in	the	middle	,	the	french	 arm 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	giant	 ham 	 burger 	 	.
you	do	n't	want	to	be	the	ham	in	the	middle	.
i	was	there	to	report	on	that	story	in	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	;	it	's	my	side	job	,	if	you	want	.
so	you	see	the	style	is	different	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	more	serious	than	 may 	 be 	 	 editor 	 ial 	 	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	.
i	went	to	 place 	 s 	 	like	gaza	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	war	in	2009	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 journal 	 ism 	 	in	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
you	'll	hear	more	and	more	about	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	future	of	 journal 	 ism 	 	,	i	think	.
and	of	course	,	i	went	to	see	the	 rebel 	 s 	 	in	the	north	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	poor	 guy 	 s 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.
there	was	an	ethnic	side	to	 th 	 is 	 	conflict	 a 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	often	in	africa	.
and	i	went	to	see	the	dozo	.
the	dozo	,	they	are	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 hunter 	 s 	 	of	west	africa	.
people	fear	them	--	they	help	the	 rebel 	 lion 	 	a	lot	.
they	are	 believ 	 ed 	 	to	have	 magic 	 al 	 	 power 	 s 	 	.
they	can	disappear	and	 es 	 cape 	 	 bullet 	 s 	 	.
i	went	to	see	a	dozo	chief	;	he	told	me	about	his	 magic 	 al 	 	 power 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	can	chop	your	head	off	right	away	and	 br 	 ing 	 	you	back	to	life	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	do	n't	have	time	for	 th 	 is 	 	right	now	.	``
``	 an 	 other 	 	time	.	``
so	back	in	abidjan	,	i	was	 give 	 n 	 	a	chance	to	lead	a	 work 	 shop 	 	with	local	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	there	and	i	thought	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	in	a	 con 	 text 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 cartoon 	 s 	 	can	 re 	 ally 	 	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	against	the	other	side	.
i	mean	,	the	press	in	 iv 	 ory 	 	coast	was	 bitter 	 ly 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	--	it	was	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	media	in	rwanda	before	the	genocide	--	so	imagine	.
and	what	can	a	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	do	?
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 editor 	 s 	 	would	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	to	draw	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	,	and	the	guy	 ha 	 s 	 	to	feed	his	family	,	right	?
so	the	idea	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	.
we	 br 	 ought 	 	together	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	from	all	 side 	 s 	 	in	 iv 	 ory 	 	coast	.
we	took	them	away	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	for	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	do	a	project	together	,	tackle	the	 issue 	 s 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	country	in	 cartoon 	 s 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	in	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
show	the	positive	power	of	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	great	tool	of	communication	for	bad	or	for	good	.
and	 cartoon 	 s 	 	can	cross	 bound 	 aries 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	.
and	humor	is	a	good	way	,	i	think	,	to	address	serious	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	what	they	did	.
i	mean	,	they	did	n't	agree	with	each	other	--	that	was	not	the	point	.
and	i	did	n't	ask	them	to	do	nice	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
the	first	day	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	even	 shout 	 ing 	 	at	each	other	.
but	they	came	up	with	a	book	,	looking	back	at	13	 year 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 al 	 	crisis	in	 iv 	 ory 	 	coast	.
so	the	idea	was	there	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 project 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	2009	in	lebanon	,	 th 	 is 	 	year	in	kenya	,	back	in	january	.
in	lebanon	,	it	was	not	a	book	.
the	idea	was	to	have	--	the	same	principal	,	a	 divid 	 ed 	 	country	--	take	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	from	all	 side 	 s 	 	and	let	them	do	 some 	 thing 	 	together	.
so	in	lebanon	,	we	 enroll 	 ed 	 	the	 news 	 paper 	 	 editor 	 s 	 	,	and	we	got	them	to	publish	eight	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	from	all	 side 	 s 	 	all	together	on	the	same	page	,	 address 	 ing 	 	the	issue	 affect 	 ing 	 	lebanon	,	like	 relig 	 ion 	 	in	 politic 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
and	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.
for	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	of	beirut	 publish 	 ed 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	together	--	anti	-	government	,	pro	-	government	,	christian	,	muslim	,	of	course	,	english	-	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	well	,	you	name	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	great	project	.
and	then	in	kenya	,	what	we	did	was	 address 	 ing 	 	the	issue	of	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	a	poison	in	a	lot	of	 place 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
and	we	did	video	 clip 	 s 	 	--	you	can	see	them	if	you	go	to	youtube	/	kenyatoons	.
so	,	 preach 	 ing 	 	for	 free 	 dom 	 	of	speech	is	easy	here	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	in	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	of	 repress 	 ion 	 	or	division	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	can	a	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	do	?
he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	keep	his	job	.
well	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	any	 con 	 text 	 	 any 	 where 	 	,	he	 al 	 ways 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	choice	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	to	do	a	cartoon	that	will	feed	hatred	.
and	that	's	the	 mess 	 age 	 	i	try	to	convey	to	them	.
i	think	we	all	 al 	 ways 	 	have	the	choice	in	the	end	not	to	do	the	bad	thing	.
but	we	need	to	support	these	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	critical	and	 respons 	 ible 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	in	africa	,	in	lebanon	,	in	your	local	 news 	 paper 	 	,	in	the	apple	store	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	tech	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	the	world	's	largest	 editor 	 s 	 	.
they	decide	what	is	too	offensive	or	too	 pro 	 voc 	 ative 	 	for	you	to	see	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	not	about	the	 free 	 dom 	 	of	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	;	it	's	about	your	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	.
and	for	 dictator 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	,	the	good	news	is	when	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	,	 journalist 	 s 	 	and	 activist 	 s 	 	shut	up	.
thank	you	.
