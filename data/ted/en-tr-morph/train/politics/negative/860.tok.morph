about	a	year	ago	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	question	:	``	 know 	 ing 	 	what	i	know	,	why	am	i	not	a	 veget 	 arian 	 	?	``
after	all	,	i	'm	one	of	the	green	 guy 	 s 	 	:	i	grew	up	with	 hip 	 pie 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	in	a	log	 cab 	 in 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 s 	 ite 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	treehugger	--	i	care	about	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	that	eating	a	mere	 ham 	 burger 	 	a	day	can	 in 	 crease 	 	my	risk	of	 dy 	 ing 	 	by	a	third	.
 cruel 	 ty 	 	:	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	the	10	billion	 animal 	 s 	 	we	raise	each	year	for	meat	are	raised	in	 factor 	 y 	 	farm	 condition 	 s 	 	that	we	,	 hypo 	 critical 	 ly 	 	,	would	n't	even	consider	for	our	own	 cat 	 s 	 	,	 dog 	 s 	 	and	other	 pet 	 s 	 	.
 environment 	 ally 	 	,	meat	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 cause 	 s 	 	more	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	than	all	of	 transport 	 ation 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	:	 car 	 s 	 	,	 train 	 s 	 	,	 plane 	 s 	 	,	 bus 	 es 	 	,	 boat 	 s 	 	,	all	of	it	.
and	beef	production	uses	100	 time 	 s 	 	the	water	that	most	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	do	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	'm	not	 al 	 one 	 	.
we	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	are	eating	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	meat	 a 	 s 	 	we	did	in	the	50s	.
so	what	was	once	the	special	little	side	treat	now	is	the	main	,	much	more	regular	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	any	of	these	 angle 	 s 	 	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	me	to	go	 veget 	 arian 	 	.
yet	,	there	i	was	--	 ch 	 k 	 	,	 ch 	 k 	 	,	 ch 	 k 	 	--	 tuck 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	big	old	steak	.
so	why	was	i	 stall 	 ing 	 	?
i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	what	i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 pitch 	 ed 	 	was	a	 bin 	 ary 	 	solution	.
it	was	either	you	're	a	meat	eater	or	you	're	a	 veget 	 arian 	 	,	and	i	guess	i	just	was	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	ready	.
imagine	your	last	 ham 	 burger 	 	.
so	my	common	sense	,	my	good	 intent 	 ions 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	in	conflict	with	my	taste	 bud 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'd	commit	to	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	 lat 	 er 	 	never	came	.
sound	familiar	?
so	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	might	there	be	a	third	solution	?
and	i	thought	about	it	,	and	i	came	up	with	one	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	the	last	year	,	and	it	's	great	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 week 	 day 	 	 ve 	 g 	 	.
the	name	 say 	 s 	 	it	all	:	 noth 	 ing 	 	with	a	face	monday	through	friday	.
on	the	 week 	 end 	 	,	your	choice	.
simple	.
if	you	want	to	take	it	to	the	next	level	,	remember	,	the	major	 culprit 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 environment 	 al 	 	damage	and	health	are	red	and	 process 	 ed 	 	 meat 	 s 	 	.
so	you	want	to	swap	 t 	 hose 	 	out	with	some	good	,	 sustain 	 ably 	 	 harvest 	 ed 	 	fish	.
it	's	 structure 	 d 	 	,	so	it	 end 	 s 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	simple	to	remember	,	and	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	break	it	here	and	there	.
after	all	,	cutting	five	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	is	cutting	70	percent	of	your	meat	 in 	 take 	 	.
the	program	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	great	,	 week 	 day 	 	 ve 	 g 	 	.
my	 foot 	 print 	 	's	 small 	 er 	 	,	i	'm	 less 	 en 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	i	feel	better	about	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	even	saving	money	.
best	of	all	,	i	'm	 health 	 ier 	 	,	i	know	that	i	'm	going	to	live	 long 	 er 	 	,	and	i	've	even	lost	a	little	weight	.
so	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	ask	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	for	your	health	,	for	your	 pocket 	 book 	 	,	for	the	environment	,	for	the	 animal 	 s 	 	:	what	's	 stop 	 ping 	 	you	from	giving	 week 	 day 	 	 ve 	 g 	 	a	shot	?
after	all	,	if	all	of	us	ate	half	 a 	 s 	 	much	meat	,	it	would	be	like	half	of	us	thank	you	.
