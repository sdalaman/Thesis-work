i	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	poem	after	 hear 	 ing 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	known	actress	tell	a	 ver 	 y 	 	well	known	 interview 	 er 	 	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	``	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 late 	 ly 	 	.
i	just	wish	it	 we 	 re 	 	more	 organize 	 d 	 	.	``
so	...
if	i	controlled	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	you	could	auction	your	broken	heart	on	ebay	.
take	the	money	;	go	to	amazon	;	buy	a	 phone 	 book 	 	for	a	country	you	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	to	--	call	 folk 	 s 	 	at	random	 un 	 til 	 	you	find	 some 	 one 	 	who	 flirt 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	in	a	foreign	language	.
if	i	 we 	 re 	 	in	charge	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	you	could	mapquest	your	lover	's	mood	 s 	 wing 	 s 	 	.
hang	left	at	 crank 	 y 	 	,	right	at	 pre 	 occupied 	 	,	u	-	turn	on	silent	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	all	the	way	back	to	tongue	 kiss 	 ing 	 	and	good	 lo 	 vin 	 	'	.
you	could	 navig 	 ate 	 	and	understand	every	 emotion 	 al 	 	 intersect 	 ion 	 	.
some	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 a 	 s 	 	 sh 	 allow 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 ba 	 king 	 	pan	,	but	i	still	stretch	 mile 	 s 	 	in	all	 direction 	 s 	 	.
if	i	owned	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	napster	,	 mon 	 ster 	 	and	friendster.com	would	be	one	big	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
that	way	you	could	listen	to	cool	music	while	you	pretend	to	look	for	a	job	and	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	just	 chat 	 tin 	 	'	with	your	 pal 	 s 	 	.
heck	,	if	i	ran	the	web	,	you	could	email	dead	people	.
they	would	not	email	you	back	--	but	you	'd	get	an	 autom 	 ated 	 	 re 	 ply 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	name	in	your	 in 	 box 	 	--	it	's	all	you	 want 	 ed 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
and	a	 mess 	 age 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	it	's	me	.	i	 mis 	 s 	 	you	.
listen	,	you	'll	see	 be 	 ing 	 	dead	is	 dan 	 dy 	 	.
now	you	go	back	to	raising	 kid 	 s 	 	and	 w 	 aging 	 	peace	and	 crav 	 ing 	 	 can 	 dy 	 	.	``
if	i	designed	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 child 	 hood 	 .com 	 	would	be	a	loop	of	a	boy	in	an	 orc 	 hard 	 	,	with	a	ski	pole	for	a	 s 	 word 	 	,	 trash 	 can 	 	 li 	 d 	 	for	a	shield	,	 shout 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	am	the	emperor	of	 o 	 range 	 s 	 	.
i	am	the	emperor	of	 o 	 range 	 s 	 	.	i	am	the	emperor	of	 o 	 range 	 s 	 	.	``
now	follow	me	,	ok	?
grandma.com	would	be	a	recipe	for	biscuits	and	 s 	 pit 	 	-	bath	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.
one	,	two	,	three	.
that	 link 	 s 	 	with	 hot 	 dig 	 g 	 ity 	 dog 	 .com 	 	.
that	is	my	 grand 	 father 	 	.
they	take	you	to	gruff	-	ex	-	cop	-	on	-	his	-	fourth	-	marriage	.	dad	.
he	 form 	 s 	 	an	 attach 	 ment 	 	to	kind	-	of	-	ditzy	-	but	-	still	-	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	-	 ging 	 er 	 	-	 snap 	 s 	 	-	for	-	christmas	.	mom	,	who	 download 	 s 	 	the	boy	in	the	 orc 	 hard 	 	,	the	emperor	of	 o 	 range 	 s 	 	,	who	 grow 	 s 	 	up	to	be	me	--	the	guy	who	 usual 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	too	far	.
so	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	emperor	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	i	guess	i	'd	still	be	mortal	,	huh	?
but	at	that	point	,	i	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	have	the	 low 	 est 	 	possible	mortgage	and	the	most	 enlarg 	 ed 	 	possible	penis	--	so	i	would	 out 	 law 	 	spam	on	my	first	day	in	 off 	 ice 	 	.
i	would	n't	need	it	.
i	'd	be	like	some	kind	of	 inter 	 net 	 	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	and	me	,	i	'd	like	to	 up 	 grade 	 	to	 de 	 ity 	 	and	 may 	 be 	 	just	like	that	--	pop	!	--	i	'd	go	 wire 	 less 	 	.
huh	?	 may 	 be 	 	google	would	hire	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	could	zip	through	your	 serv 	 ers 	 	and	 fire 	 wall 	 s 	 	like	a	virus	 un 	 til 	 	the	world	wide	web	is	 a 	 s 	 	wise	,	 a 	 s 	 	wild	and	 a 	 s 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	think	a	modern	-	day	miracle	/	 or 	 acle 	 	can	get	,	but	,	ooh	-	eee	,	you	want	to	bet	just	how	whack	and	un	-	pc	your	mac	or	pc	is	going	to	be	when	i	'm	 rock 	 ing 	 	hot	-	shit	-	hot	-	shot	-	god	.	net	?
i	guess	it	's	just	like	life	.
it	is	not	a	question	of	if	you	can	--	it	's	:	do	ya	?
we	can	interfere	with	the	 inter 	 face 	 	.
we	can	make	``	you	've	got	hallelujah	``	the	national	 ant 	 hem 	 	of	 cyber 	 space 	 	every	 luck 	 y 	 	time	we	log	on	.
you	do	n't	say	a	 pray 	 er 	 	.
you	do	n't	write	a	psalm	.
you	do	n't	chant	an	``	om	.	``
you	 s 	 end 	 	one	 bless 	 ed 	 	email	to	 whom 	 ever 	 	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	of	at	dah	-	da	-	la	-	dat	-	da	-	dah	-	da	-	la	-	dat.com	.
