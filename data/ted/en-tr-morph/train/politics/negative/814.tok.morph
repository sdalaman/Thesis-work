so	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	at	ted	we	talk	a	lot	about	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	and	how	to	make	a	 move 	 ment 	 	.
so	let	's	watch	a	 move 	 ment 	 	happen	,	start	to	finish	,	in	under	three	 minute 	 s 	 	and	dissect	some	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	from	it	.
first	,	of	course	you	know	,	a	 lead 	 er 	 	 need 	 s 	 	the	 gut 	 s 	 	to	stand	out	and	be	 ridicul 	 ed 	 	.
but	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	is	so	easy	to	follow	.
so	here	's	his	first	 follow 	 er 	 	with	a	 cruci 	 al 	 	role	;	he	's	going	to	show	 every 	 one 	 	else	how	to	follow	.
now	,	notice	that	the	 lead 	 er 	 	 embrace 	 s 	 	him	 a 	 s 	 	an	equal	.
so	,	now	it	's	not	about	the	 lead 	 er 	 	 any 	 more 	 	;	it	's	about	them	,	plural	.
now	,	there	he	is	 call 	 ing 	 	to	his	 friend 	 s 	 	.
now	,	if	you	notice	that	the	first	 follow 	 er 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	 under 	 estimate 	 d 	 	form	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	in	 it 	 self 	 	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	 gut 	 s 	 	to	stand	out	like	that	.
the	first	 follow 	 er 	 	is	what	 transform 	 s 	 	a	lone	nut	 in 	 to 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	.
and	here	 come 	 s 	 	a	second	 follow 	 er 	 	.
now	it	's	not	a	lone	nut	,	it	's	not	two	nuts	--	three	is	a	crowd	,	and	a	crowd	is	news	.
so	a	 move 	 ment 	 	must	be	public	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	show	not	just	to	show	the	 lead 	 er 	 	,	but	the	 follow 	 ers 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	find	that	new	 follow 	 ers 	 	 emul 	 ate 	 	the	 follow 	 ers 	 	,	not	the	 lead 	 er 	 	.
now	,	here	come	two	more	people	,	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	after	,	three	more	people	.
now	we	've	got	 moment 	 um 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 tip 	 ping 	 	point	.
now	we	've	got	a	 move 	 ment 	 	.
so	,	notice	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	more	people	join	in	,	it	's	less	 risk 	 y 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	 f 	 ence 	 	before	,	now	have	no	reason	not	to	.
they	wo	n't	stand	out	,	they	wo	n't	be	 ridicul 	 ed 	 	,	but	they	will	be	part	of	the	in	-	crowd	if	they	 hur 	 ry 	 	.
so	,	over	the	next	minute	,	you	'll	see	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	that	prefer	to	stick	with	the	crowd	 be 	 cause 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	they	would	be	 ridicul 	 ed 	 	for	not	 join 	 ing 	 	in	.
and	that	's	how	you	make	a	 move 	 ment 	 	.
but	let	's	 re 	 cap 	 	some	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	first	,	if	you	are	the	type	,	like	the	 shirt 	 less 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	guy	that	is	 stand 	 ing 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	remember	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	your	first	few	 follow 	 ers 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 equal 	 s 	 	so	it	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	about	the	 move 	 ment 	 	,	not	you	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	but	we	might	have	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	the	real	 less 	 on 	 	here	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	 less 	 on 	 	,	if	you	 notice 	 d 	 	--	did	you	catch	it	?	--	is	that	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	is	over	-	 glor 	 ified 	 	.
that	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	was	the	 shirt 	 less 	 	guy	who	was	first	,	and	he	'll	get	all	the	credit	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	first	 follow 	 er 	 	that	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	lone	nut	 in 	 to 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	told	that	we	should	all	be	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	that	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 effective 	 	.
if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	 start 	 ing 	 	a	 move 	 ment 	 	,	have	the	courage	to	follow	and	show	 other 	 s 	 	how	to	follow	.
and	when	you	find	a	lone	nut	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	great	,	have	the	 gut 	 s 	 	to	be	the	first	one	to	stand	up	and	join	in	.
and	what	a	perfect	place	to	do	that	,	at	ted	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
