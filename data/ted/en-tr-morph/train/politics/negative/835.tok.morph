good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
happy	to	see	so	 man 	 y 	 	fine	 folk 	 s 	 	out	here	and	so	 man 	 y 	 	 smil 	 ing 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
i	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	peculiar	 back 	 ground 	 	,	attitude	and	approach	to	the	real	world	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	a	 conjure 	 r 	 	.
now	,	i	prefer	that	term	over	 magic 	 ian 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	a	 magic 	 ian 	 	,	that	would	mean	that	i	use	 spell 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 cant 	 ations 	 	and	weird	 gest 	 ures 	 	in	order	to	accomplish	real	magic	.
no	,	i	do	n't	do	that	;	i	'm	a	 conjure 	 r 	 	,	who	is	 some 	 one 	 	who	 pretend 	 s 	 	to	be	a	real	 magic 	 ian 	 	.
now	,	how	do	we	go	about	that	sort	of	thing	?
we	depend	on	the	fact	that	 audience 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	will	make	 assumption 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	here	and	i	took	the	 micro 	 phone 	 	from	the	stand	and	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	it	on	,	you	 assum 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 micro 	 phone 	 	,	which	it	is	not	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	about	half	of	you	,	more	than	half	of	you	will	not	be	familiar	with	.
it	's	a	beard	 trim 	 mer 	 	,	you	see	?
and	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	 micro 	 phone 	 	;	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
the	other	assumption	that	you	made	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	little	 less 	 on 	 	is	to	show	you	that	you	will	make	 assumption 	 s 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	you	can	,	but	that	you	will	when	they	are	 proper 	 ly 	 	 suggest 	 ed 	 	to	you	.
you	 believ 	 e 	 	i	'm	looking	at	you	.
wrong	.	i	'm	not	looking	at	you	.	i	ca	n't	see	you	.
i	know	you	're	out	there	,	they	told	me	 back 	 stage 	 	,	it	's	a	full	house	and	 s 	 uch 	 	.
i	know	you	're	there	 be 	 cause 	 	i	can	hear	you	,	but	i	ca	n't	see	you	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 normal 	 ly 	 	wear	 glass 	 es 	 	.
these	are	not	 glass 	 es 	 	,	these	are	empty	 frame 	 s 	 	.
 quit 	 e 	 	empty	 frame 	 s 	 	.
now	why	would	a	grown	man	appear	before	you	 wear 	 ing 	 	empty	 frame 	 s 	 	on	his	face	?
to	fool	you	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	to	deceive	you	,	to	show	that	you	,	too	,	can	make	 assumption 	 s 	 	.
do	n't	you	ever	forget	that	.
now	,	i	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	--	first	of	all	,	 s 	 witch 	 	to	real	 glass 	 es 	 	so	i	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	you	,	which	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	a	convenience	.	i	do	n't	know	.
i	have	n't	had	a	good	look	.	well	,	it	's	not	that	great	a	convenience	.
i	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	now	,	which	 seem 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	strange	for	a	 magic 	 ian 	 	.
but	i	'm	going	to	take	some	 medic 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	full	bottle	of	 calm 	 s 	 	forte	.
i	'll	explain	that	in	just	a	moment	.
 ignor 	 e 	 	the	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,	that	's	what	the	government	 ha 	 s 	 	to	put	in	there	to	 con 	 fuse 	 	you	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	.
i	will	take	 en 	 ough 	 	of	these	.	mm	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	whole	 contain 	 er 	 	.
thirty	-	two	 table 	 ts 	 	of	 calm 	 s 	 	forte	.
now	that	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	--	i	'll	explain	it	in	a	moment	--	i	must	tell	you	that	i	am	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
i	'm	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	who	 play 	 s 	 	a	specific	part	.
i	play	the	part	of	a	 magic 	 ian 	 	,	a	wizard	,	if	you	will	,	a	real	wizard	.
if	 some 	 one 	 	 we 	 re 	 	to	appear	on	 th 	 is 	 	stage	in	front	of	me	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	claim	to	be	an	ancient	prince	of	denmark	named	 ham 	 let 	 	,	you	would	be	 insult 	 ed 	 	and	 right 	 ly 	 	so	.
why	would	a	man	 assum 	 e 	 	that	you	would	 believ 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	bizarre	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
but	there	 exist 	 s 	 	out	there	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	population	of	people	who	will	tell	you	that	they	have	 psych 	 ic 	 	,	 magic 	 al 	 	 power 	 s 	 	that	they	can	predict	the	future	,	that	they	can	make	contact	with	the	 de 	 cease 	 d 	 	.
oh	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	say	they	will	sell	you	 astro 	 logy 	 	or	other	 fortune 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 method 	 s 	 	.
oh	,	they	 glad 	 ly 	 	sell	you	that	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
and	they	 al 	 so 	 	say	that	they	can	give	you	 perpetu 	 al 	 	motion	 machine 	 s 	 	and	free	energy	 system 	 s 	 	.
they	claim	to	be	 psych 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	or	 sensitive 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	they	can	.
but	the	one	thing	that	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	big	 come 	 back 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	business	of	 s 	 peaking 	 	with	the	dead	.
now	,	to	my	 innoc 	 ent 	 	mind	,	dead	 im 	 plies 	 	 in 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	.
you	might	agree	with	me	on	that	.
but	these	people	,	they	tend	to	tell	you	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	they	communicate	with	the	dead	--	``	hi	,	there	``	--	but	they	can	hear	the	dead	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	they	can	 re 	 lay 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	back	to	the	living	.
i	wonder	if	that	's	true	.
i	do	n't	think	so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 sub 	 culture 	 	of	people	use	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 gimmick 	 s 	 	that	we	 magic 	 ians 	 	do	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	--	the	same	physical	 method 	 s 	 	,	the	same	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 method 	 s 	 	--	and	they	 effective 	 ly 	 	and	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	deceive	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	around	the	earth	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 detri 	 ment 	 	.
they	deceive	these	people	,	 cost 	 s 	 	them	a	lot	of	money	,	cost	them	a	lot	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	 angu 	 ish 	 	.
 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 pent 	 	every	year	,	all	over	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	on	these	 char 	 lat 	 an 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	have	two	 question 	 s 	 	i	would	like	to	ask	these	people	if	i	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	do	so	.
first	question	:	if	i	want	to	ask	them	to	call	up	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	hear	them	through	the	ear	.
they	listen	to	the	 spirit 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	call	up	the	ghost	of	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	when	she	 di 	 ed 	 	,	she	had	the	family	will	,	and	she	 secret 	 ed 	 	it	 some 	 place 	 	.	we	do	n't	know	where	it	is	,	so	we	ask	 grann 	 y 	 	,	``	where	is	the	will	,	 grann 	 y 	 	?	``
what	 do 	 es 	 	 grann 	 y 	 	say	?	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	in	heaven	and	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
i	'm	here	with	all	my	old	 friend 	 s 	 	,	my	 de 	 cease 	 d 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	and	my	family	and	all	the	puppy	 dog 	 s 	 	and	the	 kit 	 ten 	 s 	 	that	i	used	to	have	when	i	was	a	little	girl	.
and	i	love	you	,	and	i	'll	 al 	 ways 	 	be	with	you	.
good	bye	.	``
and	she	did	n't	answer	the	damn	question	!
where	is	the	will	?
now	,	she	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	it	's	in	the	library	on	the	second	shelf	,	 be 	 hind 	 	the	encyclopedia	,	``	but	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	say	that	.	no	,	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	any	 use 	 ful 	 	information	to	us	.
we	paid	a	lot	of	money	for	that	information	,	be	we	did	n't	get	it	.
the	second	question	that	i	'd	like	to	ask	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	simple	:	suppose	i	ask	them	to	contact	the	spirit	of	my	 de 	 cease 	 d 	 	father	-	in	-	law	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
why	do	they	insist	on	 say 	 ing 	 	--	remember	,	they	speak	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ear	--	why	do	they	say	,	``	my	name	 start 	 s 	 	with	j	or	m	?	``
is	 th 	 is 	 	a	 hunt 	 ing 	 	game	?
 hunt 	 ing 	 	and	 fish 	 ing 	 	?	what	is	it	?
is	it	20	 question 	 s 	 	?	no	,	it	's	more	like	120	 question 	 s 	 	.
but	it	is	a	cruel	,	 vic 	 ious 	 	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 con 	 science 	 less 	 	--	i	'll	be	all	right	,	keep	your	 seat 	 s 	 	--	game	that	these	people	play	.
and	they	take	advantage	of	the	 innoc 	 ent 	 	,	the	naive	,	the	 griev 	 ing 	 	,	the	 need 	 y 	 	people	out	there	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	process	that	is	 call 	 ed 	 	cold	 read 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	one	fellow	out	there	,	van	praagh	is	his	name	,	james	van	praagh	.
he	's	one	of	the	big	 practitioner 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.
john	edward	,	sylvia	browne	and	rosemary	altea	,	they	are	other	 oper 	 ators 	 	.
there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	all	over	the	earth	,	but	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	james	van	praagh	is	 ver 	 y 	 	big	.
and	what	 do 	 es 	 	he	do	?	he	 like 	 s 	 	to	tell	you	how	the	 de 	 cease 	 d 	 	got	 de 	 cease 	 d 	 	,	the	people	he	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	through	his	ear	,	you	see	?
so	what	he	 say 	 s 	 	is	,	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	is	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	he	 tell 	 s 	 	me	,	he	 tell 	 s 	 	me	,	before	he	 pass 	 ed 	 	,	that	he	had	trouble	 breath 	 ing 	 	.	``
 folk 	 s 	 	,	that	's	what	 dy 	 ing 	 	is	all	about	!
you	stop	 breath 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	you	're	dead	.
it	's	that	simple	.
and	that	's	the	kind	of	information	they	're	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	back	to	you	?
i	do	n't	think	so	.
now	,	these	people	will	make	 guess 	 es 	 	,	they	'll	say	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	why	am	i	 get 	 ting 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	?
he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	to	me	,	'	 electric 	 ity 	 	.	'	was	he	an	 electric 	 ian 	 	?	``	``	no.	``
``	did	he	ever	have	an	electric	razor	?	``	``	no.	``
it	was	a	game	of	 hunt 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	go	through	.
now	,	 folk 	 s 	 	often	ask	us	at	the	james	randi	 education 	 al 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	,	they	call	me	,	they	say	,	``	why	are	you	so	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	mr.	randi	?
is	n't	it	just	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	?	``
no	,	it	is	not	 f 	 un 	 	.	it	is	a	cruel	 far 	 ce 	 	.
now	,	it	may	 br 	 ing 	 	a	certain	amount	of	comfort	,	but	that	comfort	 last 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	about	20	 minute 	 s 	 	or	so	.
and	then	the	people	look	in	the	mirror	,	and	they	say	,	i	just	paid	a	lot	of	money	for	that	 read 	 ing 	 	.
and	what	did	she	say	to	me	?	'	i	love	you	!	'	``	they	 al 	 ways 	 	say	that	.
they	do	n't	get	any	information	,	they	do	n't	get	any	value	for	what	they	 s 	 pend 	 	.
now	,	sylvia	browne	is	the	big	 oper 	 ator 	 	.
we	call	her	``	the	talons	.	``
sylvia	browne	--	thank	you	--	sylvia	browne	is	the	big	 oper 	 ator 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	at	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	moment	.
now	,	sylvia	browne	--	just	to	show	you	--	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	700	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	a	20	minute	 read 	 ing 	 	over	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	go	there	in	person	,	and	you	have	to	wait	up	to	two	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	 book 	 ed 	 	 a 	 head 	 	that	amount	of	time	.
you	pay	by	credit	card	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	and	then	she	will	call	you	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	next	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
you	can	tell	it	's	her	.	``	 hell 	 o 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	sylvia	browne	.	``
that	's	her	,	you	can	tell	right	away	.
now	,	montel	williams	is	an	intelligent	man	.
we	all	know	who	he	is	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
he	's	well	educated	,	he	's	smart	,	he	 know 	 s 	 	what	sylvia	browne	is	 do 	 ing 	 	but	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	a	damn	.

and	the	strange	thing	--	 folk 	 s 	 	,	you	may	have	 notice 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	too	.
you	see	these	 folk 	 s 	 	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	--	they	never	call	 any 	 body 	 	back	from	hell	.
 every 	 one 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	from	heaven	,	but	never	from	hell	.
if	they	call	back	any	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	going	to	...	well	,	you	see	the	story	.
now	,	sylvia	browne	is	an	exception	,	an	exception	in	one	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	james	randi	 education 	 al 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	,	my	 found 	 ation 	 	,	 off 	 ers 	 	a	one	million	dollar	prize	in	 negoti 	 able 	 	 bond 	 s 	 	.

and	we	have	n't	heard	from	her	since	.	strange	.

all	the	more	reason	to	take	the	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	would	n't	you	think	,	sylvia	?
now	these	people	need	to	be	 stop 	 ped 	 	,	 serious 	 ly 	 	now	.
they	need	to	be	 stop 	 ped 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cruel	 far 	 ce 	 	.

what	is	 home 	 opathy 	 	?
it	's	taking	a	medicine	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	and	 dil 	 uting 	 	it	down	well	beyond	avogadro	's	limit	.
 dil 	 uting 	 	it	down	to	the	point	where	there	's	 non 	 e 	 	of	it	left	.
now	 folk 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	a	metaphor	i	'm	going	to	give	you	now	,	it	's	true	.
it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	taking	one	325	 milli 	 gram 	 	 aspir 	 in 	 	 table 	 t 	 	,	 throw 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	middle	of	lake	tahoe	,	and	then	 stir 	 ring 	 	it	up	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	stick	,	and	 wait 	 ing 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	 un 	 til 	 	the	solution	is	 homogen 	 eous 	 	.
then	,	when	you	get	a	 head 	 ache 	 	,	you	take	a	 s 	 ip 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	water	,	and	--	 vo 	 ila 	 	!	--	it	is	gone	.
now	that	is	true	.	that	is	what	 home 	 opathy 	 	is	all	about	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	claim	that	they	make	--	you	'll	love	 th 	 is 	 	one	--	the	more	 di 	 lute 	 	the	medicine	is	,	they	say	,	the	more	 power 	 ful 	 	it	is	.
now	wait	a	minute	,	we	heard	about	a	guy	in	florida	.
the	poor	man	,	he	was	on	 home 	 opathic 	 	medicine	.
he	 di 	 ed 	 	of	an	 over 	 dose 	 	.
he	 for 	 got 	 	to	take	his	pill	.
work	on	it	.	work	on	it	.
it	's	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	thing	.	it	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	all	 th 	 is 	 	 non 	 sense 	 	over	all	these	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	,	let	me	tell	you	,	the	james	randi	 education 	 al 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	is	 wav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	big	carrot	,	but	i	must	say	,	the	fact	that	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	us	up	on	 th 	 is 	 	 off 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	the	 power 	 s 	 	do	n't	exist	.
they	might	,	some	place	out	there	.
 may 	 be 	 	these	people	are	just	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	.
well	,	with	sylvia	browne	i	would	think	so	.
you	know	,	700	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	a	20	minute	 read 	 ing 	 	over	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	--	that	's	more	than	 lawyer 	 s 	 	make	!
i	mean	that	's	a	fabulous	amount	of	money	.
these	people	do	n't	need	the	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	but	would	n't	you	think	they	'd	like	to	take	it	just	to	make	me	look	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	?
just	to	get	rid	of	 th 	 is 	 	 god 	 less 	 	person	out	there	that	sylvia	browne	 talk 	 s 	 	about	all	the	time	?
i	think	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	would	love	to	have	 suggest 	 ions 	 	from	you	 folk 	 s 	 	on	how	to	contact	federal	,	state	and	local	 author 	 ities 	 	to	get	them	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
if	you	find	out	--	now	i	understand	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	people	,	even	 to 	 day 	 	,	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	us	about	 aid 	 s 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 s 	 	and	 starv 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	around	the	world	and	 imp 	 ure 	 	water	 suppli 	 es 	 	that	people	have	to	suffer	with	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 critical 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	.
and	we	must	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	 a 	 s 	 	arthur	c.	clarke	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	 rot 	 ting 	 	of	the	human	mind	,	the	business	of	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	the	 para 	 normal 	 	and	the	 oc 	 cult 	 	and	the	 super 	 natural 	 	--	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	total	 non 	 sense 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 med 	 ieval 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	--	i	think	 some 	 thing 	 	should	be	 d 	 one 	 	about	that	,	and	it	all	lies	in	education	.
 large 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	the	media	who	are	to	blame	for	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.
they	 shame 	 lessly 	 	promote	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 non 	 sense 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 pleas 	 es 	 	the	 sponsor 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	bottom	line	,	the	dollar	line	.
that	's	what	they	're	looking	at	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	must	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	your	 suggest 	 ions 	 	,	and	i	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	have	you	tune	in	to	our	 web 	 page 	 	.
it	's	 www. 	 rand 	 i 	 .org 	 	.
go	in	there	and	look	at	the	 archiv 	 es 	 	,	and	you	will	begin	to	understand	much	more	of	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
you	will	see	the	 record 	 s 	 	that	we	have	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	that	library	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	family	appear	there	and	say	that	mum	 g 	 ave 	 	away	all	the	family	fortune	.
she	 cash 	 ed 	 	in	the	cds	,	she	 g 	 ave 	 	away	the	 stock 	 s 	 	and	the	 certificate 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	to	hear	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 help 	 ed 	 	them	one	bit	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 solve 	 d 	 	any	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	there	could	be	a	 rot 	 ting 	 	of	the	american	mind	,	and	of	the	 mind 	 s 	 	all	the	way	around	the	earth	,	if	we	do	n't	start	to	think	 sens 	 ibly 	 	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	,	we	've	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	carrot	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	we	've	 d 	 angle 	 d 	 	the	carrot	.
we	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	 psych 	 ic 	 s 	 	to	come	forth	and	snap	at	it	.
oh	,	we	get	 lot 	 s 	 	of	them	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	every	year	come	by	.
these	are	 dowse 	 rs 	 	and	people	who	think	that	they	can	talk	to	the	dead	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	but	they	're	 amateur 	 s 	 	;	they	do	n't	know	how	to	evaluate	 the 	 ir 	 	own	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 power 	 s 	 	.
the	 professional 	 s 	 	never	come	near	us	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	in	that	case	of	sylvia	browne	that	i	told	you	about	a	moment	ago	.
she	did	accept	and	then	 back 	 ed 	 	away	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	i	'm	james	randi	,	and	i	'm	 wait 	 ing 	 	.
