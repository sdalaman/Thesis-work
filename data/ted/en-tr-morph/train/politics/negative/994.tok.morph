i	'm	a	bug	lover	,	 my 	 self 	 	--	not	from	 child 	 hood 	 	,	by	the	way	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	late	.
when	i	 bachelor 	 ed 	 	,	 major 	 ing 	 	in	 zoo 	 logy 	 	in	tel	aviv	university	,	i	kind	of	fell	in	love	with	 bug 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	 with 	 in 	 	 zoo 	 logy 	 	,	i	took	the	course	or	the	discipline	of	 entomo 	 logy 	 	,	the	science	of	 insect 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	thought	,	 my 	 self 	 	,	how	can	i	be	practical	or	help	in	the	science	of	 entomo 	 logy 	 	?
and	then	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	the	world	of	plant	 protect 	 ion 	 	--	plant	 protect 	 ion 	 	from	 insect 	 s 	 	,	from	bad	 bug 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 with 	 in 	 	plant	 protect 	 ion 	 	,	i	came	 in 	 to 	 	the	discipline	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	pest	control	which	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	define	 a 	 s 	 	the	use	of	living	 organism 	 s 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	 population 	 s 	 	of	 nox 	 ious 	 	plant	 pest 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	a	whole	discipline	in	plant	 protect 	 ion 	 	that	's	 aim 	 ing 	 	at	the	 r 	 eduction 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
and	 bio 	 logical 	 	pest	control	,	by	the	way	,	or	these	good	 bug 	 s 	 	that	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	they	've	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	for	a	long	,	long	time	.
but	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	last	120	 year 	 s 	 	or	people	 k 	 new 	 	more	and	more	how	to	exploit	,	or	how	to	use	,	 th 	 is 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	control	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	or	in	fact	,	natural	control	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 need 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	control	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	you	can	see	it	in	your	 back 	 yard 	 	.
just	take	a	 magn 	 ifying 	 	glass	.	you	see	what	i	have	here	?
that	's	a	 magn 	 ifier 	 	 time 	 s 	 	10	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	 time 	 s 	 	10	.
just	open	it	.
you	just	twist	 leav 	 es 	 	,	and	you	see	a	whole	new	world	of	minute	 insect 	 s 	 	,	or	little	 spider 	 s 	 	of	one	millimeter	,	one	and	a	half	,	two	 millimeter 	 s 	 	long	,	and	you	can	distinguish	between	the	good	 one 	 s 	 	and	the	bad	 one 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	natural	control	 exist 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
here	,	in	front	of	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	.
just	have	a	look	at	the	 plant 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	 every 	 where 	 	,	and	we	need	to	know	how	to	exploit	it	.
well	let	us	go	hand	by	hand	and	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	through	just	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
what	is	a	pest	?
what	damage	[	 do 	 es 	 	]	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	inflict	on	the	plant	?
and	what	is	the	natural	 ene 	 my 	 	,	the	 bio 	 logically 	 	controlled	agent	,	or	the	good	bug	,	that	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?
in	general	,	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 insect 	 s 	 	and	 spider 	 s 	 	,	or	 mite 	 s 	 	,	let	us	call	them	.
 insect 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	six	-	legged	 organism 	 s 	 	and	 spider 	 s 	 	or	 mite 	 s 	 	,	the	eight	-	legged	 organism 	 s 	 	.
let	's	have	a	look	at	that	.
here	is	a	pest	,	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	pest	,	a	spider	mite	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	 web 	 bing 	 	like	a	spider	.
you	see	the	mother	in	between	and	two	 daughter 	 s 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	on	the	left	and	right	,	and	a	single	egg	on	the	right	-	hand	side	.
and	then	you	see	what	kind	of	damage	it	can	inflict	.
on	your	right	-	hand	side	you	can	see	a	cucumber	leaf	,	and	on	the	middle	,	cotton	leaf	,	and	on	the	left	a	tomato	leaf	with	these	little	 stipp 	 ling 	 s 	 	.
they	can	 liter 	 ally 	 	turn	from	green	to	white	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 suck 	 ing 	 	,	 pierc 	 ing 	 	 mouth 	 part 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 spider 	 s 	 	.
but	here	 come 	 s 	 	nature	that	 provide 	 s 	 	us	with	a	good	spider	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 predator 	 y 	 	mite	--	just	 a 	 s 	 	small	 a 	 s 	 	a	spider	mite	,	by	the	way	,	one	millimeter	,	two	 millimeter 	 s 	 	long	,	not	more	than	that	,	running	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 hunt 	 ing 	 	,	chasing	the	spider	 mite 	 s 	 	.
and	here	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	in	action	on	your	left	-	hand	side	--	just	 pierc 	 es 	 	,	 suck 	 s 	 	the	body	 fluid 	 s 	 	on	the	left	-	hand	side	of	the	pest	mite	.
and	after	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	see	:	just	a	typical	dead	 corp 	 s 	 e 	 	,	 shrivel 	 ed 	 	,	 suck 	 ed 	 	-	out	,	dead	 corp 	 s 	 e 	 	of	the	spider	mite	,	and	next	to	it	,	two	 sati 	 ated 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	of	 predator 	 y 	 	 mite 	 s 	 	,	a	mother	on	the	left	-	hand	side	,	a	young	nymph	on	the	right	-	hand	side	.
by	the	way	,	a	meal	for	them	for	24	 hour 	 s 	 	is	about	five	 individual 	 s 	 	of	the	spider	 mite 	 s 	 	,	of	the	bad	 mite 	 s 	 	,	or	15	to	20	 egg 	 s 	 	of	the	pest	 mite 	 s 	 	.
by	the	way	,	they	are	 hung 	 ry 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	.
and	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	 aphid 	 s 	 	.
by	the	way	,	it	's	 spring 	 time 	 	now	in	israel	.
when	temperature	 rise 	 s 	 	 sharp 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	see	 t 	 hose 	 	bad	 one 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 aphid 	 s 	 	,	all	over	the	 plant 	 s 	 	,	in	your	 hib 	 is 	 cus 	 	,	in	your	 lan 	 tana 	 	,	in	the	young	,	fresh	 folia 	 ge 	 	of	the	spring	flush	,	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	.
by	the	way	,	with	 aphid 	 s 	 	you	have	 on 	 ly 	 	 female 	 s 	 	,	like	amazons	.
 female 	 s 	 	giving	rise	to	 female 	 s 	 	giving	rise	to	other	 female 	 s 	 	.
no	 male 	 s 	 	at	all	.
parthenogenesis	,	[	 a 	 s 	 	it	]	was	so	 call 	 ed 	 	.
and	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	with	that	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	.
here	we	can	see	the	damage	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 aphid 	 s 	 	 secret 	 e 	 	some	 stick 	 y 	 	,	 sugar 	 y 	 	liquid	and	 th 	 is 	 	just	 glob 	 s 	 	the	upper	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	plant	.
here	you	see	a	typical	cucumber	leaf	that	 turn 	 ed 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	green	to	black	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	black	fungus	,	 soot 	 y 	 	mold	,	which	is	 cover 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	here	 come 	 s 	 	the	 salv 	 ation 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	 parasit 	 ic 	 	wasp	.
here	we	are	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	predator	.
here	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	a	 parasit 	 e 	 	--	not	a	two	-	legged	 parasit 	 e 	 	,	but	an	eight	-	legged	 parasit 	 e 	 	,	of	course	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 parasit 	 ic 	 	wasp	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	two	 millimeter 	 s 	 	long	,	 s 	 lender 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	and	sharp	 fli 	 er 	 	.
and	here	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 parasit 	 e 	 	in	action	,	like	in	an	acrobatic	maneuver	.
she	 stand 	 s 	 	vis	-	a	-	vis	in	front	of	the	victim	at	the	right	-	hand	side	,	 bend 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	abdomen	and	 insert 	 ing 	 	a	single	egg	,	a	single	egg	 in 	 to 	 	the	body	 fluid 	 s 	 	of	the	aphid	.
by	the	way	,	the	aphid	tries	to	 es 	 cape 	 	.
she	 kick 	 s 	 	and	 bite 	 s 	 	and	 secret 	 es 	 	different	 liquid 	 s 	 	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	will	happen	,	in	fact	.
 on 	 ly 	 	the	egg	of	the	 parasit 	 e 	 	will	be	 insert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	body	 fluid 	 s 	 	of	the	aphid	.
and	after	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	 up 	 on 	 	temperature	,	the	egg	will	hatch	and	the	larva	of	 th 	 is 	 	 parasit 	 e 	 	will	eat	the	aphid	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	natural	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	natural	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	fiction	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	your	 back 	 yard 	 	,	in	your	 back 	 yard 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	end	result	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	end	result	:	mummies	--	m	-	u	-	m	-	m	-	y	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	visual	result	of	a	dead	aphid	 en 	 compass 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	in	fact	,	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	 parasit 	 oid 	 	that	after	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	you	see	 half 	 way 	 	out	.
the	birth	is	 al 	 most 	 	complete	.
you	can	see	,	by	the	way	,	in	different	 movie 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	just	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	.
and	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	female	,	she	'll	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	mate	with	a	male	and	off	she	 go 	 es 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	time	is	 ver 	 y 	 	short	.
 th 	 is 	 	female	can	live	 on 	 ly 	 	three	to	four	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	she	 need 	 s 	 	to	give	rise	to	around	400	 egg 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	she	 ha 	 s 	 	400	bad	 aphid 	 s 	 	to	put	her	 egg 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	body	 fluid 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	of	course	not	the	end	of	it	.
there	is	a	whole	wealth	of	other	natural	 ene 	 mies 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	last	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	'll	start	first	with	the	pest	:	the	 th 	 rip 	 s 	 	.
by	the	way	,	all	these	weird	 name 	 s 	 	--	i	did	n't	 both 	 er 	 	you	with	the	latin	 name 	 s 	 	of	these	 creature 	 s 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	just	the	popular	 name 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	nice	,	 s 	 lender 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	pest	.
if	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	,	sweet	 pepper 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	an	 ex 	 otic 	 	,	 orna 	 mental 	 	sweet	pepper	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	sweet	pepper	which	is	not	 consum 	 able 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	a	viral	disease	 transmit 	 ted 	 	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 th 	 rip 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
and	here	 come 	 s 	 	the	natural	 ene 	 my 	 	,	minute	pirate	bug	,	``	minute	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 ra 	 ther 	 	small	.
here	you	can	see	the	adult	,	black	,	and	two	young	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	action	.
 th 	 is 	 	adult	 pierc 	 es 	 	the	 th 	 rip 	 s 	 	,	 suck 	 ing 	 	it	 with 	 in 	 	just	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 minute 	 s 	 	,	just	going	to	the	other	 pre 	 y 	 	,	 continu 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	place	.
and	if	we	spread	 t 	 hose 	 	minute	pirate	 bug 	 s 	 	,	the	good	 one 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	a	sweet	pepper	plot	,	they	go	to	the	 flower 	 s 	 	.
and	look	,	 th 	 is 	 	flower	is	 flood 	 ed 	 	with	 predator 	 y 	 	 bug 	 s 	 	,	with	the	good	 one 	 s 	 	after	 wi 	 ping 	 	out	the	bad	 one 	 s 	 	,	the	 th 	 rip 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	positive	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	by	the	way	.
no	harm	to	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	fruit	.	no	harm	to	the	fruit	set	.
 every 	 thing 	 	is	just	fine	under	these	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	question	is	,	here	you	saw	them	on	a	one	-	to	-	one	 bas 	 is 	 	--	the	pest	,	the	natural	 ene 	 my 	 	.
what	we	do	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	 north 	 east 	 	israel	,	in	kibbutz	sde	eliyahu	,	there	is	a	 facil 	 ity 	 	that	mass	-	 produce 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	natural	 ene 	 mies 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	what	we	do	there	,	we	 ampl 	 ify 	 	,	we	 ampl 	 ify 	 	the	natural	control	,	or	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	control	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
and	in	30,000	square	 meter 	 s 	 	of	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 green 	 house 	 s 	 	,	there	,	we	are	mass	-	producing	 t 	 hose 	 	 predator 	 y 	 	 mite 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	minute	pirate	 bug 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 parasit 	 ic 	 	 wasp 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
 man 	 y 	 	different	 part 	 s 	 	.
by	the	way	,	they	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	--	you	see	the	jordanian	 mountain 	 s 	 	on	the	one	hand	and	the	jordan	 val 	 ley 	 	on	the	other	hand	,	and	a	good	,	mild	winter	and	a	nice	,	hot	summer	,	which	is	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	condition	to	mass	-	produce	 t 	 hose 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
and	by	the	way	,	mass	-	production	--	it	is	not	genetic	 manipul 	 ation 	 	.
there	are	no	gmos	--	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	--	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
we	take	them	from	nature	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	we	do	,	we	give	them	the	optimal	 condition 	 s 	 	,	under	the	 green 	 house 	 s 	 	or	in	the	climate	rooms	,	in	order	to	 pro 	 life 	 rate 	 	,	 multi 	 ply 	 	and	 re 	 produce 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	get	,	in	fact	.
you	see	under	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
you	see	in	the	upper	left	corner	,	you	see	a	single	 predator 	 y 	 	mite	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	whole	bunch	of	 predator 	 y 	 	 mite 	 s 	 	.
you	see	 th 	 is 	 	ampoule	.	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
i	have	one	gram	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 predator 	 y 	 	 mite 	 s 	 	.
one	gram	's	80,000	 individual 	 s 	 	,	80,000	 individual 	 s 	 	are	good	 en 	 ough 	 	to	control	one	acre	,	4,000	square	 meter 	 s 	 	,	of	a	 straw 	 berry 	 	plot	against	spider	 mite 	 s 	 	for	the	whole	season	of	 al 	 most 	 	one	year	.
and	we	can	produce	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	you	me	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	on	an	annual	 bas 	 is 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	call	 ampl 	 ification 	 	of	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
and	no	,	we	do	not	disrupt	the	balance	.
on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	every	cultural	plot	where	the	balance	was	 al 	 ready 	 	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	by	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
here	we	come	with	 t 	 hose 	 	natural	 ene 	 mies 	 	in	order	to	reverse	a	little	bit	of	the	wheel	and	to	 br 	 ing 	 	more	natural	balance	to	the	 agricultur 	 al 	 	plot	by	 reduc 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	whole	idea	.
and	what	is	the	impact	?
in	 th 	 is 	 	table	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	what	is	an	impact	of	a	 success 	 ful 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	control	by	good	 bug 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	israel	,	where	we	employ	more	than	1,000	 hectare 	 s 	 	--	10,000	dunams	in	israeli	 term 	 s 	 	--	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	pest	 controll 	 ing 	 	sweet	pepper	under	 protect 	 ion 	 	,	75	percent	of	the	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	.
and	israeli	 straw 	 berries 	 	,	even	more	--	80	percent	of	the	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 aim 	 ed 	 	against	pest	 mite 	 s 	 	in	 straw 	 berries 	 	.
so	the	impact	is	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	.
and	there	 go 	 es 	 	the	question	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	ask	 grow 	 ers 	 	,	 agricultur 	 ists 	 	:	why	 bio 	 logical 	 	control	?
why	good	 bug 	 s 	 	?
by	the	way	,	the	number	of	 answer 	 s 	 	you	get	 equal 	 s 	 	the	number	of	people	you	ask	.
but	if	we	go	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	 south 	 east 	 	israel	,	the	arava	area	above	the	great	rift	 val 	 ley 	 	,	where	the	 re 	 ally 	 	top	-	 not 	 ch 	 	--	the	pearl	of	the	israeli	 agricultur 	 e 	 	is	 locate 	 d 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	under	 green 	 house 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	or	under	 screen 	 house 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	--	if	you	drive	all	the	way	to	eilat	,	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	just	in	the	middle	of	the	desert	.
and	if	you	zoom	in	,	you	can	 definite 	 ly 	 	watch	 th 	 is 	 	,	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 children 	 	,	 distribut 	 ing 	 	the	natural	 ene 	 mies 	 	,	the	good	 bug 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 wear 	 ing 	 	special	 clothe 	 s 	 	and	gas	 mask 	 s 	 	and	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
so	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	with	respect	to	the	application	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	number	one	answer	that	we	get	from	 grow 	 ers 	 	,	why	 bio 	 logical 	 	control	.
number	two	,	 man 	 y 	 	 grow 	 ers 	 	are	in	fact	 petr 	 ified 	 	from	the	idea	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	,	that	the	 pest 	 s 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	resistant	to	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	just	in	our	case	that	bacteria	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	resistant	to	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	same	,	and	it	can	happen	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	in	either	 bio 	 logical 	 	control	or	even	natural	control	,	 resist 	 ance 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	rare	.
it	 hard 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	evolution	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	natural	ratio	,	 un 	 like 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	,	which	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	case	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	public	demand	.
public	demand	--	the	more	the	public	 demand 	 s 	 	the	 r 	 eduction 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	the	more	 grow 	 ers 	 	 be 	 come 	 	aware	of	the	fact	they	should	,	 where 	 ver 	 	they	can	and	 where 	 ver 	 	possible	,	replace	the	chemical	control	with	 bio 	 logical 	 	control	.
even	here	,	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	 grow 	 er 	 	,	you	see	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 bug 	 s 	 	,	the	bad	 one 	 s 	 	and	the	good	 one 	 s 	 	,	 wear 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 magn 	 ifier 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	on	her	head	,	just	 walk 	 ing 	 	 safe 	 ly 	 	in	her	crop	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	get	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	my	vision	,	or	in	fact	,	to	my	dream	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 re 	 ality 	 	.
have	a	look	at	the	gap	.
if	we	take	the	 over 	 all 	 	 turn 	 over 	 	of	the	 bio 	 control 	 	industry	 world 	 wide 	 	,	it	's	250	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	look	at	the	 over 	 all 	 	 pest 	 icide 	 	industry	in	all	the	 crop 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	.
i	think	it	's	 time 	 s 	 	100	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
twenty	-	five	billion	.
so	there	is	a	huge	gap	to	bridge	.
so	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	how	can	we	do	it	?
how	can	we	bridge	,	or	let	's	say	,	narrow	,	 th 	 is 	 	gap	in	the	course	of	the	 year 	 s 	 	?
first	of	all	,	we	need	to	find	more	 ro 	 bust 	 	,	good	and	 reli 	 able 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	,	more	good	 bug 	 s 	 	that	we	can	either	mass	-	produce	or	 actual 	 ly 	 	 conserv 	 e 	 	in	the	field	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	to	create	even	more	intensive	and	strict	public	demand	to	 r 	 eduction 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	the	 agricultur 	 al 	 	fresh	produce	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	by	the	 grow 	 ers 	 	to	the	potential	of	 th 	 is 	 	industry	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	gap	 re 	 ally 	 	 narrow 	 s 	 	.
step	by	step	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	narrow	.
so	i	think	my	last	slide	is	:	all	we	are	 say 	 ing 	 	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ing 	 	it	:	give	nature	a	chance	.
so	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	it	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	all	the	 bio 	 control 	 	 petition 	 ers 	 	and	 implement 	 ers 	 	,	in	israel	and	 a 	 broad 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	give	nature	a	chance	.
thank	you	.
