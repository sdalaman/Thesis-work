i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
but	it	's	a	broad	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 delic 	 ate 	 	subject	,	so	i	have	to	limit	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	i	will	limit	 my 	 self 	 	to	 on 	 ly 	 	talk	about	the	 link 	 s 	 	between	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	 sexual 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	talk	.
so	i	will	talk	of	what	i	remember	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
it	's	when	the	young	couple	whisper	,	``	 to 	 night 	 	we	are	going	to	make	a	baby	.	``
my	talk	will	be	about	the	impact	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	on	the	number	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	per	woman	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	that	there	is	some	sort	of	limit	on	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	we	can	be	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
and	there	are	some	people	who	say	that	the	world	population	is	growing	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	three	billion	in	1960	,	seven	billion	just	last	year	--	and	it	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	grow	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 relig 	 ions 	 	that	stop	women	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	few	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	and	it	may	 continu 	 e 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
to	what	 ex 	 tent 	 	are	these	people	right	?
when	i	was	born	there	was	less	than	one	billion	children	in	the	world	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	,	2000	,	there	's	 al 	 most 	 	two	billion	.
what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	since	,	and	what	do	the	 expert 	 s 	 	predict	will	happen	with	the	number	of	children	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	century	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	quiz	.	what	do	you	think	?
do	you	think	it	will	 de 	 crease 	 	to	one	billion	?
will	it	remain	the	same	and	be	two	billion	by	the	end	of	the	century	?
will	the	number	of	children	 in 	 crease 	 	each	year	up	to	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	or	will	it	 continu 	 e 	 	in	the	same	fast	rate	and	be	four	billion	children	up	there	?
i	will	tell	you	by	the	end	of	my	speech	.
but	now	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	have	to	do	with	it	?
when	you	want	to	 class 	 ify 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	it	's	more	difficult	than	you	think	.
you	go	to	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	and	the	first	map	you	find	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 divide 	 s 	 	the	world	 in 	 to 	 	abrahamic	 relig 	 ions 	 	and	eastern	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	but	that	's	not	 detail 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.
so	we	went	on	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	in	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	we	found	 th 	 is 	 	map	.
but	that	 sub 	 divide 	 s 	 	christianity	,	islam	and	buddhism	 in 	 to 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 sub 	 group 	 s 	 	,	which	was	too	 detail 	 ed 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	at	gapminder	we	made	our	own	map	,	and	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
each	country	's	a	bubble	.
the	 s 	 ize 	 	is	the	population	--	big	 chin 	 a 	 	,	big	india	here	.
and	the	color	now	is	the	 major 	 ity 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	the	 relig 	 ion 	 	where	more	than	50	percent	of	the	people	say	that	they	belong	.
it	's	eastern	 relig 	 ion 	 	in	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	and	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	asian	 count 	 ries 	 	.
islam	is	the	 major 	 ity 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	all	the	way	from	the	atlantic	ocean	 a 	 cross 	 	the	middle	east	,	southern	europe	and	through	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	all	the	way	to	indonesia	.
that	's	where	we	find	islamic	 major 	 ity 	 	.
and	christian	 major 	 ity 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	we	see	in	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.	they	are	blue	.
and	that	is	most	 count 	 ries 	 	in	america	and	europe	,	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	africa	and	a	few	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
the	white	here	are	 count 	 ries 	 	which	can	not	be	 class 	 ified 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	one	 relig 	 ion 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	reach	50	percent	or	there	is	doubt	about	the	data	or	there	's	some	other	reason	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	with	that	.
so	bear	with	our	 simpl 	 icity 	 	now	when	i	take	you	over	to	 th 	 is 	 	shot	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	1960	.
and	now	i	show	the	number	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	per	woman	here	:	two	,	four	or	six	--	 man 	 y 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	few	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
and	here	the	income	per	person	in	 compar 	 able 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	for	that	is	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	say	you	have	to	get	rich	first	before	you	get	few	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
so	low	income	here	,	high	income	there	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	in	1960	,	you	had	to	be	a	rich	christian	to	have	few	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
the	exception	was	japan	.
japan	here	was	 regard 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	exception	.
 other 	 wise 	 	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	christian	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	there	was	 al 	 so 	 	 man 	 y 	 	christian	 count 	 ries 	 	that	had	six	to	seven	 bab 	 ies 	 	per	woman	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	latin	america	or	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	africa	.
and	 count 	 ries 	 	with	islam	 a 	 s 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	all	of	them	 al 	 most 	 	had	six	to	seven	children	per	woman	,	 ir 	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	income	level	.
and	all	the	eastern	 relig 	 ions 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	japan	had	the	same	level	.
now	let	's	see	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	.
i	start	the	world	,	and	here	we	go	.
now	1962	--	can	you	see	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	 rich 	 er 	 	,	but	the	number	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	per	woman	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	?
look	at	 chin 	 a 	 	.	they	're	 fall 	 ing 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	fast	.
and	all	of	the	muslim	 major 	 ity 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	income	are	coming	down	,	 a 	 s 	 	do	the	christian	 major 	 ity 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	middle	income	range	.
and	when	we	enter	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	century	,	you	'll	find	more	than	half	of	 man 	 kind 	 	down	here	.
and	by	2010	,	we	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	80	percent	of	 human 	 s 	 	who	live	in	 count 	 ries 	 	with	about	two	children	per	woman	.
it	's	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	these	are	 count 	 ries 	 	from	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	here	,	with	$	40,000	per	capita	,	france	,	russia	,	iran	,	mexico	,	 tur 	 key 	 	,	algeria	,	indonesia	,	india	and	all	the	way	to	bangladesh	and	vietnam	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	less	than	five	percent	of	the	income	per	person	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	same	amount	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	per	woman	.
i	can	tell	you	that	the	data	on	the	number	of	children	per	woman	is	 surprising 	 ly 	 	good	in	all	 count 	 ries 	 	.
we	get	that	from	the	census	data	.
it	's	not	one	of	these	 statistic 	 s 	 	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 doubt 	 ful 	 	.
so	what	we	can	conclude	is	you	do	n't	have	to	get	rich	to	have	few	children	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
and	then	when	we	look	at	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	we	can	see	that	the	eastern	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	there	's	not	one	single	country	with	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	more	than	three	children	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	with	islam	 a 	 s 	 	a	 major 	 ity 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	christianity	,	you	see	 count 	 ries 	 	all	the	way	.
but	there	's	no	major	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
there	's	no	major	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	these	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
there	is	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	with	income	.
the	 count 	 ries 	 	which	have	 man 	 y 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	per	woman	here	,	they	have	 quit 	 e 	 	low	income	.
most	of	them	are	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
but	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	here	like	guatemala	,	like	papua	new	guinea	,	like	yemen	and	afghanistan	.
 man 	 y 	 	think	that	afghanistan	here	and	congo	,	which	have	 suffer 	 ed 	 	severe	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	that	they	do	n't	have	fast	population	growth	.
it	's	the	other	way	around	.
in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	's	the	 count 	 ries 	 	that	have	the	highest	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rates	that	have	the	 fast 	 est 	 	population	growth	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	death	of	a	child	is	 compens 	 ated 	 	by	one	more	child	.
these	 count 	 ries 	 	have	six	children	per	woman	.
they	have	a	 s 	 ad 	 	death	rate	of	one	to	two	children	per	woman	.
but	30	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	afghanistan	will	go	from	30	million	to	60	million	.
congo	will	go	from	60	to	120	.
that	's	where	we	have	the	fast	population	growth	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	think	that	these	 count 	 ries 	 	are	 stag 	 nant 	 	,	but	they	are	not	.
let	me	 compar 	 e 	 	senegal	,	a	muslim	 dominate 	 d 	 	country	,	with	a	christian	 dominate 	 d 	 	country	,	ghana	.
i	take	them	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	here	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	up	here	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	1960s	.
just	look	what	they	have	 d 	 one 	 	.
it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	from	seven	children	per	woman	,	they	've	gone	all	the	way	down	to	between	four	and	five	.
it	's	a	tremendous	 improve 	 ment 	 	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	take	?
well	we	know	 quit 	 e 	 	well	what	is	 need 	 ed 	 	in	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
you	need	to	have	children	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
you	need	to	get	out	of	the	 deep 	 est 	 	poverty	so	children	are	not	of	 import 	 ance 	 	for	work	in	the	family	.
you	need	to	have	access	to	some	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
and	you	need	the	fourth	factor	,	which	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	factor	.
but	let	me	 illustr 	 ate 	 	that	fourth	factor	by	looking	at	qatar	.
here	we	have	qatar	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	there	we	have	bangladesh	 to 	 day 	 	.
if	i	take	these	 count 	 ries 	 	back	to	the	 year 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	which	is	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	year	--	'71	,	'72	--	it	's	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	which	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
look	at	bangladesh	and	qatar	.
with	so	different	 income 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	drop	in	number	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	per	woman	.
and	what	is	the	reason	in	qatar	?
well	i	do	 a 	 s 	 	i	 al 	 ways 	 	do	.
i	went	to	the	 statistic 	 al 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	of	qatar	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 web 	 page 	 	--	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 web 	 page 	 	.	i	recommend	it	--	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	--	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	can	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 f 	 un 	 	here	--	and	 provide 	 d 	 	free	of	charge	,	i	found	qatar	's	social	 trend 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	 lot 	 s 	 	to	read	.
i	found	 fertil 	 ity 	 	at	birth	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	total	 fertil 	 ity 	 	rate	per	woman	.
these	are	the	 scholar 	 s 	 	and	 expert 	 s 	 	in	the	government	 age 	 ncy 	 	in	qatar	,	and	they	say	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	are	:	``	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	age	at	first	marriage	,	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 education 	 al 	 	level	of	qatari	woman	and	more	women	 integrate 	 d 	 	in	the	labor	force	.	``
i	could	n't	agree	more	.	science	could	n't	agree	more	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	country	that	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	through	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 modern 	 ization 	 	.
so	what	it	is	,	is	these	four	:	children	should	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	children	should	n't	be	 need 	 ed 	 	for	work	,	women	should	get	education	and	join	the	labor	force	and	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	should	be	 access 	 ible 	 	.
now	look	 aga 	 in 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	average	number	of	children	in	the	world	is	like	in	colombia	--	it	's	2.4	 to 	 day 	 	.
there	are	 count 	 ries 	 	up	here	which	are	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	.
and	that	's	where	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	,	better	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	is	 need 	 ed 	 	.
i	 strong 	 ly 	 	recommend	melinda	 gate 	 s 	 	'	last	tedtalk	.
and	here	,	down	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	which	are	less	than	two	children	per	woman	.
so	when	i	go	back	now	to	give	you	the	answer	of	the	quiz	,	it	's	two	.
we	have	 reach 	 ed 	 	peak	child	.
the	number	of	children	is	not	growing	any	 long 	 er 	 	in	the	world	.
we	are	still	 deb 	 ating 	 	peak	oil	,	but	we	have	 definite 	 ly 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	peak	child	.
and	the	world	population	will	stop	growing	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	population	division	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	it	will	stop	growing	at	10	billion	.
but	why	do	they	grow	if	the	number	of	children	 do 	 es 	 	n't	grow	?
well	i	will	show	you	here	.
i	will	use	these	card	boxes	in	which	your	 note 	 book 	 s 	 	came	.
they	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	for	 education 	 al 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	.
each	card	box	is	one	billion	people	.
and	there	are	two	billion	children	in	the	world	.
there	are	two	billion	young	people	between	15	and	30	.
these	are	 round 	 ed 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
then	there	is	one	billion	between	30	and	45	,	 al 	 most 	 	one	between	45	and	60	.
and	then	it	's	my	box	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	me	:	60	-	plus	.
we	are	here	on	top	.
so	what	will	happen	now	is	what	we	call	``	the	big	fill	-	up	.	``
you	can	see	that	it	's	like	three	billion	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	here	.
they	are	not	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	 di 	 ed 	 	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	never	born	.
 be 	 cause 	 	before	1980	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	much	 few 	 er 	 	people	born	than	there	 we 	 re 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	what	will	happen	now	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	.
the	old	,	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	we	will	die	.
the	rest	of	you	,	you	will	grow	 old 	 er 	 	and	you	will	get	two	billion	children	.
then	the	old	will	die	.
the	rest	will	grow	 old 	 er 	 	and	get	two	billion	children	.
and	then	 aga 	 in 	 	the	old	will	die	and	you	will	get	two	billion	children	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	great	fill	-	up	.
it	's	 inevit 	 able 	 	.
and	can	you	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	took	place	 with 	 out 	 	life	 get 	 ting 	 	 long 	 er 	 	and	 with 	 out 	 	 add 	 ing 	 	children	?
 relig 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	to	do	with	the	number	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	per	woman	.
all	the	 relig 	 ions 	 	in	the	world	are	fully	 cap 	 able 	 	to	maintain	 the 	 ir 	 	 value 	 s 	 	and	adapt	to	 th 	 is 	 	new	world	.
and	we	will	be	just	10	billion	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	if	the	 poor 	 est 	 	people	get	out	of	poverty	,	 the 	 ir 	 	children	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	they	get	access	to	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
that	is	 need 	 ed 	 	.
but	it	's	 inevit 	 able 	 	that	we	will	be	two	to	three	billion	more	.
so	when	you	discuss	and	when	you	plan	for	the	 resource 	 s 	 	and	the	energy	 need 	 ed 	 	for	the	future	,	for	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	you	have	to	plan	for	10	billion	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
