 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	know	when	the	stethoscope	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	?
any	 guess 	 es 	 	?	1816	.
and	what	i	can	say	is	,	in	2016	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	are	n't	going	to	be	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	with	 stethoscope 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	whole	lot	better	technology	coming	,	and	that	's	part	of	the	change	in	medicine	.
what	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 wire 	 less 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
but	the	future	are	digital	medical	 wire 	 less 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	ok	?
so	,	let	me	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	to	kind	of	make	 th 	 is 	 	much	more	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	one	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 electro 	 cardio 	 gram 	 	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cardio 	 logist 	 	,	to	think	that	you	could	see	in	real	time	a	patient	,	an	individual	,	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	on	your	 smart 	 phone 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	rhythm	--	that	's	 in 	 credible 	 	,	and	it	's	with	us	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	that	's	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
you	check	your	email	while	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	.
in	the	future	you	're	going	to	be	 check 	 ing 	 	all	your	vital	 sign 	 s 	 	,	all	your	vital	 sign 	 s 	 	:	your	heart	rhythm	,	your	blood	pressure	,	your	oxygen	,	your	temperature	,	etc	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 air 	 strip 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
it	's	now	wired	--	or	i	should	say	,	 wire 	 less 	 	--	by	taking	the	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	of	these	 signal 	 s 	 	in	the	hospital	,	in	the	intensive	care	unit	,	and	 put 	 ting 	 	it	on	a	 smart 	 phone 	 	for	 physician 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	an	 expect 	 ant 	 	parent	,	what	about	the	ability	to	monitor	,	 continu 	 ously 	 	,	 fet 	 al 	 	heart	rate	,	or	 intra 	 ut 	 er 	 ine 	 	 contract 	 ions 	 	,	and	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	worry	so	much	that	 thing 	 s 	 	are	fine	 a 	 s 	 	the	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	,	and	moving	over	 in 	 to 	 	the	time	of	 deliver 	 y 	 	?
and	then	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	further	,	 to 	 day 	 	we	have	 continu 	 ous 	 	glucose	 sensor 	 s 	 	.
right	now	,	they	are	under	the	skin	,	but	in	the	future	,	they	wo	n't	have	to	be	 implant 	 ed 	 	.
and	of	course	,	the	 desir 	 ed 	 	range	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	keep	glucose	between	75	and	less	than	200	,	 check 	 ing 	 	it	every	five	 minute 	 s 	 	in	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	glucose	sensor	--	you	'll	see	how	that	can	impact	diabetes	.
and	what	about	sleep	?
we	're	going	to	zoom	in	on	that	a	little	bit	.
we	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	third	of	our	life	in	sleep	.
what	if	,	on	your	phone	,	which	will	be	 avail 	 able 	 	in	the	next	few	 week 	 s 	 	,	you	had	every	minute	of	your	sleep	 dis 	 play 	 ed 	 	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	the	awake	is	the	 o 	 range 	 	.
the	rem	sleep	,	rapid	eye	 move 	 ment 	 	,	dream	state	,	is	in	light	green	;	and	light	is	gray	,	light	sleep	;	and	deep	sleep	,	the	best	 resto 	 rative 	 	sleep	,	is	that	dark	green	.
how	about	 count 	 ing 	 	every	calorie	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	ability	,	in	real	time	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	 measure 	 ments 	 	of	caloric	 in 	 take 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 expend 	 iture 	 	,	through	a	band	-	aid	.
now	,	what	i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	are	physiologic	 metric 	 s 	 	.
but	what	i	want	to	get	to	,	the	next	 front 	 ier 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	why	the	stethoscope	is	on	 it 	 s 	 	way	out	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	transcend	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 val 	 ve 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	,	and	the	breath	 sound 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	,	 introduc 	 ed 	 	by	g.e	.	is	a	 hand 	 held 	 	ultra	-	sound	.
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	much	more	sensitive	.
here	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	an	abdominal	 ultra 	 sound 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	a	cardiac	echo	,	which	can	be	 s 	 ent 	 	 wire 	 less 	 	,	and	then	there	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 fet 	 al 	 	 monitor 	 ing 	 	on	your	 smart 	 phone 	 	.
so	,	we	're	not	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	physiologic	 metric 	 s 	 	--	the	key	 measure 	 ments 	 	of	vital	 sign 	 s 	 	,	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	physiology	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	all	the	 im 	 aging 	 	that	one	could	look	at	in	your	 smart 	 phone 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	 obsolet 	 e 	 	technology	,	soon	to	be	buried	:	the	holter	monitor	.
twenty	-	four	hour	 record 	 ing 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 wire 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	now	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	patch	.
you	can	put	it	on	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 end 	 	it	in	the	mail	.
now	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	?	well	,	there	is	these	smart	band	-	 aid 	 s 	 	or	these	 sensor 	 s 	 	that	one	would	put	on	,	on	a	shoe	or	on	the	wrist	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	a	signal	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	body	area	network	to	a	 gate 	 way 	 	.
 gate 	 way 	 	could	be	a	 smart 	 phone 	 	or	it	could	be	a	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 gate 	 way 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 gate 	 ways 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	not	so	well	 integrate 	 d 	 	.
that	signal	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	web	,	the	cloud	,	and	then	it	can	be	 process 	 ed 	 	and	 s 	 ent 	 	 any 	 where 	 	:	to	a	 care 	 giver 	 	,	to	a	physician	,	back	to	the	patient	,	etc	.
so	,	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 istic 	 	technology	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	on	.
i	did	n't	want	to	take	my	shirt	off	to	show	you	,	but	i	can	tell	you	it	's	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 measure 	 s 	 	cardiac	rhythm	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	saw	 al 	 ready 	 	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 go 	 es 	 	well	beyond	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	me	now	.	and	you	can	see	the	ecg	.
 be 	 low 	 	that	's	the	actual	heart	rate	and	the	trend	;	to	the	right	of	that	is	a	 bio 	 conduct 	 ant 	 	.
that	's	the	fluid	 stat 	 us 	 	,	fluid	 stat 	 us 	 	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	if	you	're	 monitor 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	with	heart	failure	.
and	 be 	 low 	 	that	's	temperature	,	and	 re 	 spi 	 ration 	 	,	and	oxygen	,	and	then	the	position	activity	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	 measure 	 s 	 	seven	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	much	vital	 sign 	 s 	 	for	 monitor 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	with	heart	failure	.	ok	?
and	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	expensive	bed	.
what	if	we	could	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	need	for	hospital	 bed 	 s 	 	?
well	,	we	can	.	first	of	all	,	heart	failure	is	the	number	one	reason	for	hospital	 ad 	 mission 	 s 	 	and	 read 	 mission 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
the	cost	of	heart	failure	is	37	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	,	which	is	80	percent	related	to	 hospital 	 ization 	 	.
and	in	the	course	of	30	 day 	 s 	 	after	a	hospital	stay	for	a	medicare	 great 	 er 	 	than	65	 year 	 s 	 	or	 old 	 er 	 	,	is	--	27	percent	are	 re 	 admitted 	 	in	30	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	by	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	over	56	percent	are	 re 	 admitted 	 	.
so	,	can	we	improve	that	?	well	the	idea	is	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	that	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	put	it	on	600	 patient 	 s 	 	with	heart	failure	,	 random 	 ly 	 	 assign 	 ed 	 	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	600	 patient 	 s 	 	who	do	n't	have	active	 monitor 	 ing 	 	,	and	see	 whet 	 her 	 	we	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	heart	failure	 read 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	.	and	we	'll	start	that	trial	,	and	you	'll	hear	more	about	how	we	're	going	to	do	that	,	but	that	's	a	type	of	 wire 	 less 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	trial	that	could	change	medicine	in	the	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	.
why	now	?	why	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	of	a	sudden	 be 	 come 	 	a	 re 	 ality 	 	,	an	 excit 	 ing 	 	direction	in	the	future	of	medicine	?
what	we	have	is	,	in	a	way	,	a	perfect	positive	storm	.
 th 	 is 	 	 set 	 s 	 	up	consumer	-	driven	 health 	 care 	 	.
that	's	where	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 start 	 ing 	 	.
let	me	just	give	you	 specific 	 s 	 	about	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	 move 	 ment 	 	if	you	're	not	aware	of	it	:	1.2	million	americans	have	gotten	a	nike	shoe	,	which	is	a	body	-	area	network	that	 connect 	 s 	 	the	shoe	,	the	sole	of	the	shoe	to	the	iphone	,	or	an	ipod	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	wired	magazine	cover	article	 re 	 ally 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	;	it	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	the	nike	shoe	and	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 adopt 	 ed 	 	to	monitor	 exercis 	 e 	 	physiology	and	energy	 expend 	 iture 	 	.
here	are	some	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	 principle 	 s 	 	that	are	 gui 	 d 	 ing 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	to	keep	in	mind	:	``	a	data	-	driven	health	revolution	 promise 	 s 	 	to	make	us	all	better	,	 fast 	 er 	 	,	and	 strong 	 er 	 	.	living	by	 number 	 s 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	from	july	,	 th 	 is 	 	cover	article	:	``	the	personal	 metric 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	 go 	 es 	 	way	beyond	diet	and	 exercis 	 e 	 	.	it	's	about	 track 	 ing 	 	every	facet	of	life	,	from	sleep	to	mood	to	pain	,	well	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
a	lot	of	you	have	gotten	that	phillips	direct	life	.
i	did	n't	have	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	but	i	got	the	fitbit	.
that	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	like	a	 wire 	 less 	 	 accele 	 ro 	 meter 	 	,	 ped 	 o 	 meter 	 	.
and	i	want	to	just	give	you	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	that	 test 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	understand	about	the	consumer	 move 	 ment 	 	.
i	hope	the	,	by	the	way	,	the	phillips	direct	life	 work 	 s 	 	better	--	i	hope	so	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 monitor 	 s 	 	food	,	it	 monitor 	 s 	 	activity	and	 track 	 s 	 	weight	.
 how 	 ever 	 	you	have	to	put	in	most	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 track 	 s 	 	by	 it 	 self 	 	is	activity	,	and	even	then	,	it	's	not	complete	.
so	,	you	 exercis 	 e 	 	and	it	 pick 	 s 	 	up	the	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
you	put	in	your	height	and	weight	,	it	 calcul 	 ates 	 	bmi	,	and	of	course	it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	 man 	 y 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	you	're	 expend 	 ing 	 	from	the	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	and	how	 man 	 y 	 	you	took	in	,	if	you	go	in	and	enter	all	the	 food 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 s 	 	you	to	enter	all	your	activity	.
and	so	i	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	of	course	i	was	 grat 	 ified 	 	that	it	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	the	42	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	 elli 	 pt 	 ical 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	i	did	,	but	then	it	 want 	 s 	 	more	information	.
so	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	want	to	log	sexual	activity	.
how	long	did	you	do	it	for	?	``
and	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	how	hard	was	it	?	``
 further 	 more 	 	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	start	time	.	``
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	appear	--	 th 	 is 	 	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
so	,	now	i	want	to	move	to	sleep	.
who	would	ever	have	thought	you	could	have	your	own	eeg	at	your	home	,	 tag 	 ged 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	alarm	clock	,	by	the	way	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 head 	 band 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	alarm	clock	.
it	 monitor 	 s 	 	your	 brain 	 wave 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ously 	 	,	when	you	're	 sleep 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	thing	for	seven	 day 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	ready	for	tedmed	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	our	life	,	one	-	third	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 sleep 	 ing 	 	.
of	course	how	 man 	 y 	 	here	have	any	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 sleep 	 ing 	 	?
it	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	90	percent	.	so	,	you	tell	me	you	sleep	better	than	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	well	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	week	of	my	life	in	 sleep 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	get	a	z.q	.	score	.	 in 	 stead 	 	of	an	i.q	.	score	,	you	get	a	z.q	.	score	when	you	wake	up	.
you	say	,	``	oh	,	ok	.	``	and	a	z.q	.	score	is	 adjust 	 ed 	 	to	age	,	and	you	want	to	get	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	you	possibly	can	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	moment	-	by	-	moment	,	or	minute	-	by	-	minute	sleep	.
and	you	see	that	z.q	.	there	was	80	-	odd	.
and	the	wake	time	is	in	 o 	 range 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	a	problem	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 help 	 s 	 	you	with	 quant 	 ifying 	 	your	sleep	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	 other 	 s 	 	you	're	awake	.
so	,	when	my	wife	came	in	and	she	could	tell	you	're	awake	.
``	eric	,	i	want	to	talk	.	i	want	to	talk	.	``
and	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	play	 po 	 s 	 sum 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	.
ok	.	so	,	that	's	the	first	night	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	now	67	,	and	that	's	not	a	good	score	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	,	of	course	,	how	much	you	had	in	rem	sleep	,	in	deep	sleep	,	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	that	 quant 	 it 	 ation 	 	about	all	the	different	 phase 	 s 	 	of	sleep	.
so	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	then	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	you	do	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	your	age	group	.
it	's	like	a	 manage 	 d 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	of	sleep	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	thing	and	say	,	``	well	,	i	did	n't	think	i	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 sleep 	 er 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	did	better	than	average	in	50	to	60	year	olds	.	``	ok	?
and	the	key	thing	was	,	what	i	did	n't	know	,	was	that	i	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 dream 	 er 	 	.
ok	.	now	let	's	move	from	sleep	to	 disease 	 s 	 	.
 eight 	 y 	 	percent	of	americans	have	chronic	disease	,	or	80	percent	of	age	 great 	 er 	 	than	65	have	two	or	more	chronic	disease	,	140	million	americans	have	one	or	more	chronic	disease	,	and	80	percent	of	our	1.5	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	trillion	 expend 	 iture 	 s 	 	are	related	to	chronic	disease	.
now	,	diabetes	is	one	of	the	big	 one 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 most 	 	24	million	people	have	diabetes	.
and	here	is	the	 lat 	 est 	 	map	.	it	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	just	a	little	more	than	a	week	ago	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	it	is	n't	looking	good	.
that	is	,	for	men	,	29	percent	in	the	country	over	60	have	type	ii	diabetes	,	and	women	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	less	,	it	's	 terr 	 ibly 	 	high	.
but	of	course	we	have	a	way	to	measure	that	now	on	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	,	with	a	sensor	that	 detect 	 s 	 	blood	glucose	,	and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	detect	 hyper 	 glycemia 	 	that	 other 	 wise 	 	would	n't	be	known	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 hypo 	 glycemia 	 	.
and	you	can	see	the	red	 dot 	 s 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	patient	's	case	,	 we 	 re 	 	finger	 stick 	 s 	 	,	which	would	have	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	both	 end 	 s 	 	.
but	by	 continu 	 ous 	 	 monitor 	 ing 	 	,	it	 capture 	 s 	 	all	that	vital	information	.
the	future	of	 th 	 is 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	move	 th 	 is 	 	to	a	band	-	aid	type	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	and	that	's	not	so	far	away	.
so	,	let	me	just	give	you	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	10	top	 target 	 s 	 	for	 wire 	 less 	 	medicine	.

there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	 re 	 ally 	 	 accele 	 rate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	process	.
one	of	them	--	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	fortunate	--	is	to	develop	a	 dedicate 	 d 	 	institute	and	that	's	work	that	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	work	that	scripps	with	qualcomm	...
and	then	the	great	fortune	of	 meet 	 ing 	 	up	with	gary	and	mary	west	,	to	get	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 wire 	 less 	 	health	institute	.
san	diego	is	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	place	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	's	over	650	 wire 	 less 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	100	of	which	or	more	are	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 wire 	 less 	 	health	.

the	 wire 	 less 	 	institute	,	the	west	 wire 	 less 	 	health	institute	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 out 	 growth 	 	of	two	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	who	are	here	 th 	 is 	 	 even 	 ing 	 	:	gary	and	mary	west	.	and	i	'd	like	to	give	it	up	for	them	for	 get 	 ting 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	fantastic	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	made	 th 	 is 	 	possible	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 non 	 profit 	 	education	center	which	is	just	about	to	open	.	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	building	 dedicate 	 d 	 	.
and	what	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	 accele 	 rate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	era	:	to	take	 un 	 met 	 	medical	 need 	 s 	 	,	to	work	and	 innov 	 ate 	 	--	and	we	just	 ap 	 point 	 ed 	 	the	chief	engineer	,	mehran	mehregany	,	it	was	 announce 	 d 	 	on	monday	--	then	to	move	up	with	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	 valid 	 ation 	 	and	then	changing	medical	practice	,	the	most	 challeng 	 ing 	 	thing	of	all	,	 requir 	 ing 	 	attention	to	 reimburs 	 ement 	 	,	 health 	 care 	 	policy	,	 health 	 care 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	.
the	other	big	thing	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	institute	to	catalyze	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	 gui 	 dance 	 	,	and	that	's	of	course	 re 	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	the	fact	that	medicine	 go 	 es 	 	digital	.
if	we	understand	biology	from	 genomic 	 s 	 	and	omics	and	 wire 	 less 	 	through	physiologic	 pheno 	 ty 	 ping 	 	,	that	's	big	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	allow	a	 converg 	 ence 	 	like	we	've	never	had	before	.
over	80	major	 disease 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 crack 	 ed 	 	at	the	genomic	level	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	:	more	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	the	 under 	 pinning 	 s 	 	of	disease	in	the	last	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	than	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	man	.
and	when	you	put	that	together	with	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	now	an	app	for	the	iphone	with	your	 gen 	 o 	 type 	 	to	guide	drug	therapy	...
but	,	the	future	--	we	can	now	tell	who	's	going	to	get	type	ii	diabetes	from	all	the	common	 vari 	 ants 	 	,	and	that	's	going	to	get	 fill 	 ed 	 	in	more	with	low	-	frequency	 vari 	 ants 	 	in	the	future	.
we	can	tell	who	's	going	to	get	breast	cancer	from	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	know	who	's	 like 	 ly 	 	to	get	 a 	 trial 	 	 fi 	 brill 	 ation 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	sudden	cardiac	death	.
each	of	these	 ha 	 s 	 	a	sensor	.
we	can	give	glucose	a	sensor	for	diabetes	to	prevent	it	.
we	can	prevent	,	or	have	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	 detect 	 ion 	 	possible	,	for	breast	cancer	with	an	 ultra 	 sound 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	 give 	 n 	 	to	the	patient	.

we	lose	700,000	people	a	year	in	the	u.s.	from	sudden	cardiac	death	.

it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	taking	 individual 	 ized 	 	medicine	to	a	new	height	and	it	's	hyper	-	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	and	i	think	it	 represent 	 s 	 	the	black	 s 	 wan 	 	of	medicine	.
