i	'm	going	to	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	idea	that	i	'm	just	going	to	tell	you	over	and	over	 un 	 til 	 	i	get	you	to	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	and	that	is	all	of	us	are	makers	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	.
all	of	us	are	makers	.
we	're	born	makers	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	,	to	grasp	 thing 	 s 	 	with	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
we	use	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	grasp	``	 metaphor 	 ically 	 	to	 al 	 so 	 	think	about	 understand 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	just	live	,	but	we	make	.
we	create	 thing 	 s 	 	.
well	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	group	of	makers	from	maker	faire	and	 vari 	 ous 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	out	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	well	,	but	that	's	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	tall	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
it	's	a	 scrap 	 er 	 	bike	;	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	--	from	oakland	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	small	 s 	 cooter 	 	for	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
but	he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	power	it	,	or	 motor 	 ize 	 	it	,	with	a	drill	.
and	the	question	he	had	is	,	``	can	i	do	it	?	can	it	be	 d 	 one 	 	?	``
 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	it	can	.
so	makers	are	 enthusiast 	 s 	 	;	they	're	 amateur 	 s 	 	;	they	're	people	who	love	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	do	.
they	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	even	know	why	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
we	have	 beg 	 un 	 	 organ 	 izing 	 	makers	at	our	maker	faire	.
there	was	one	held	in	detroit	here	last	summer	,	and	it	will	be	held	 aga 	 in 	 	next	summer	,	at	the	henry	ford	.
but	we	hold	them	in	san	francisco	--	--	and	in	new	york	.
and	it	's	a	fabulous	event	to	just	meet	and	talk	to	these	people	who	make	 thing 	 s 	 	and	are	there	to	just	show	them	to	you	and	talk	about	them	and	have	a	great	conversation	.
guy	:	i	might	get	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
dale	dougherty	:	these	are	electric	 muffin 	 s 	 	.
guy	:	where	did	you	 guy 	 s 	 	get	 t 	 hose 	 	?
muffin	:	will	you	glide	with	us	?
dd	:	i	know	ford	 ha 	 s 	 	new	electric	 vehicle 	 s 	 	coming	out	.
we	got	there	first	.
 lad 	 y 	 	:	will	you	glide	with	us	?
dd	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	call	``	 s 	 wing 	 ing 	 	in	the	rain	.	``
and	you	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	see	it	,	but	it	's	--	a	 controll 	 er 	 	at	top	 cycle 	 s 	 	the	water	to	fall	just	before	and	after	you	pass	through	the	bottom	of	the	arc	.
so	imagine	a	kid	:	``	am	i	going	to	get	wet	?	am	i	going	to	get	wet	?
no	,	i	did	n't	get	wet	.	am	i	going	to	get	wet	?	am	i	going	to	get	wet	?	``
that	's	the	experience	of	a	clever	ride	.
and	of	course	,	we	have	fashion	.
people	are	 re 	 making 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	fashion	.
i	do	n't	know	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	basket	-	bra	,	but	it	ought	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
we	have	art	 student 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	together	,	taking	old	 radi 	 ator 	 	 part 	 s 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	an	iron	-	pour	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	new	out	of	it	.
they	did	that	in	the	summer	,	and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	warm	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	one	 take 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	of	 explain 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	are	,	right	?
billy	-	bob	,	or	billy	 bas 	 s 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
now	the	 back 	 ground 	 	is	--	the	guy	who	did	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	physicist	.
and	here	he	'll	explain	a	little	bit	about	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
richard	carter	:	i	'm	richard	carter	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sashimi	tabernacle	choir	.
choir	:	♫	when	you	hold	me	in	your	 arm 	 s 	 	♫	dd	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	computer	-	controlled	in	an	old	volvo	.
choir	:	♫	i	'm	 hook 	 ed 	 	on	a	 feel 	 in 	 	'	♫	♫	i	'm	high	on	 believ 	 in 	 	'	♫	♫	that	you	're	in	love	with	me	♫	dd	:	so	richard	came	up	from	houston	last	year	to	visit	us	in	detroit	here	and	show	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	sashimi	tabernacle	choir	.
so	,	are	you	a	maker	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	would	say	you	're	a	maker	,	if	you	raise	your	hand	?
that	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	--	but	there	's	some	of	you	out	there	that	wo	n't	admit	that	you	're	makers	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	think	about	it	.
you	're	makers	of	food	;	you	're	makers	of	shelter	;	you	're	makers	of	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	 part 	 ly 	 	what	 interest 	 s 	 	me	 to 	 day 	 	is	you	're	makers	of	your	own	world	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	role	that	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	in	your	life	.
you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	a	driver	or	a	passenger	--	to	use	a	volkswagen	phrase	.
makers	are	in	control	.
that	's	what	 fascinate 	 s 	 	them	.	that	's	why	they	do	what	they	do	.
they	want	to	figure	out	how	 thing 	 s 	 	work	;	they	want	to	get	access	to	it	;	and	they	want	to	control	it	.
they	want	to	use	it	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	purpose	.
makers	 to 	 day 	 	,	to	some	degree	,	are	out	on	the	edge	.
they	're	not	 main 	 stream 	 	.
they	're	a	little	bit	radical	.
they	're	a	bit	 sub 	 ver 	 s 	 ive 	 	in	what	they	do	.
but	at	one	time	,	it	was	 fair 	 ly 	 	 common 	 place 	 	to	think	of	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	maker	.
it	was	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	'd	even	remark	 up 	 on 	 	.
and	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	old	video	.
and	i	'll	tell	you	more	about	it	,	but	just	...
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	of	all	 thing 	 s 	 	americans	are	,	we	are	makers	.
with	our	 strength 	 s 	 	and	our	 mind 	 s 	 	and	spirit	,	we	gather	,	we	form	,	and	we	fashion	.
makers	and	 shape 	 rs 	 	and	put	-	it	-	togetherers	.
dd	:	so	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	to	show	you	people	making	 thing 	 s 	 	out	of	wood	,	a	 grand 	 father 	 	making	a	ship	in	a	bottle	,	a	woman	making	a	pie	--	 some 	 what 	 	standard	fare	of	the	day	.
but	it	was	a	sense	of	 pri 	 de 	 	that	we	made	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	the	world	around	us	was	made	by	us	.
it	did	n't	just	exist	.
we	made	it	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	it	that	way	.
and	i	think	that	's	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
now	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	one	funny	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	reel	--	it	's	an	industrial	video	--	but	it	was	 show 	 n 	 	in	drive	-	in	 theater 	 s 	 	in	1961	--	in	the	detroit	area	,	in	fact	--	and	it	 precede 	 d 	 	alfred	hitchcock	's	``	psycho	.	``
so	i	like	to	think	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	going	on	there	of	the	new	generation	of	makers	coming	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	plus	``	psycho	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	andrew	archer	.
i	met	andrew	at	one	of	our	community	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	together	maker	faire	.
andrew	had	 move 	 d 	 	to	detroit	from	duluth	,	minnesota	.
and	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	his	mom	,	and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 do 	 ing 	 	a	story	on	him	for	a	magazine	 call 	 ed 	 	kidrobot	.
he	's	just	a	kid	that	grew	up	 play 	 ing 	 	with	 tool 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
he	 like 	 d 	 	to	take	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
his	mother	 g 	 ave 	 	him	a	part	of	the	 gar 	 age 	 	,	and	he	 collect 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	from	yard	 sale 	 s 	 	,	and	he	made	stuff	.
and	then	he	did	n't	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	like	school	that	much	,	but	he	got	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 robotic 	 s 	 	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 real 	 ized 	 	he	had	a	talent	,	and	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	he	had	a	real	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	it	.
and	he	 beg 	 an 	 	building	 robot 	 s 	 	.
and	when	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	next	to	him	,	he	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	about	a	company	he	 form 	 ed 	 	,	and	he	was	building	some	 robot 	 s 	 	for	 auto 	 mobile 	 	 factor 	 ies 	 	to	move	 thing 	 s 	 	around	on	the	 factor 	 y 	 	floor	.
and	that	's	why	he	 move 	 d 	 	to	michigan	.
but	he	 al 	 so 	 	 move 	 d 	 	here	to	meet	other	people	 do 	 ing 	 	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 get 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	idea	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	jeff	and	bilal	and	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 other 	 s 	 	here	in	a	 hack 	 er 	 space 	 	.
and	there	's	about	three	 hack 	 er 	 space 	 s 	 	or	more	in	detroit	.
and	there	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	even	some	new	 one 	 s 	 	since	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	last	.
but	these	are	like	 club 	 s 	 	--	they	're	sharing	 tool 	 s 	 	,	sharing	space	,	sharing	 expert 	 ise 	 	in	what	to	make	.
and	so	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	's	going	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
but	 essential 	 ly 	 	these	are	people	that	are	 play 	 ing 	 	with	technology	.
let	me	say	that	 aga 	 in 	 	:	 play 	 ing 	 	.
they	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	know	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	or	why	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
they	're	 play 	 ing 	 	to	discover	what	the	technology	can	do	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	to	discover	what	they	can	do	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	what	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 cap 	 abilities 	 	are	.
now	the	other	thing	that	i	think	is	taking	off	,	 an 	 other 	 	reason	making	is	taking	off	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	there	's	some	great	new	 tool 	 s 	 	out	there	.
and	you	ca	n't	see	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	on	the	screen	,	but	arduino	--	arduino	is	an	open	-	source	 hard 	 ware 	 	platform	.
it	's	a	micro	-	 controll 	 er 	 	.
if	you	do	n't	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	are	,	they	're	just	the	``	 brain 	 s 	 	.	``
so	they	're	the	 brain 	 s 	 	of	maker	 project 	 s 	 	,	and	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	one	.
and	i	do	n't	know	if	you	can	see	it	that	well	,	but	that	's	a	 mail 	 box 	 	--	so	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 mail 	 box 	 	and	an	arduino	.
so	you	figure	out	how	to	program	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	put	 th 	 is 	 	in	your	 mail 	 box 	 	.
and	when	 some 	 one 	 	 open 	 s 	 	your	 mail 	 box 	 	,	you	get	a	 not 	 ification 	 	,	an	alert	 mess 	 age 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	your	iphone	.
now	that	could	be	a	dog	door	,	it	could	be	 some 	 one 	 	going	 some 	 where 	 	where	they	should	n't	,	like	a	little	brother	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	sister	's	room	.
there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	can	imagine	for	that	.
now	here	's	 some 	 thing 	 	--	a	3d	 print 	 er 	 	.
that	's	 an 	 other 	 	tool	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	taken	off	--	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	makerbot	.
and	there	are	industrial	 version 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	about	20,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	came	up	with	a	kit	version	for	750	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 hobby 	 ists 	 	and	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 folk 	 s 	 	can	get	a	hold	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	begin	 play 	 ing 	 	with	3d	 print 	 ers 	 	.
now	they	do	n't	know	what	they	want	to	do	with	it	,	but	they	're	going	to	figure	it	out	.
they	will	 on 	 ly 	 	figure	it	out	by	 get 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	it	and	 play 	 ing 	 	with	it	.
one	of	the	 cool 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	,	makerbot	 s 	 ent 	 	out	an	 up 	 grade 	 	,	some	new	brackets	for	the	box	.
well	you	 print 	 ed 	 	out	the	brackets	and	then	 replace 	 d 	 	the	old	brackets	with	the	new	 one 	 s 	 	.
is	n't	that	cool	?
so	makers	harvest	technology	from	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	around	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	radar	speed	 detect 	 or 	 	that	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	from	a	hot	 wheel 	 s 	 	 to 	 y 	 	.
and	they	do	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	creating	new	 area 	 s 	 	and	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 area 	 s 	 	that	you	might	 on 	 ly 	 	think	--	the	 militar 	 y 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 drone 	 s 	 	--	well	,	there	is	a	whole	community	of	people	building	autonomous	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	,	or	 vehicle 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	could	program	to	fly	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	stick	or	 any 	 thing 	 	,	to	figure	out	what	path	it	's	going	.
 fasci 	 nating 	 	work	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
we	just	had	an	issue	on	space	exploration	,	diy	space	exploration	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	time	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 man 	 kind 	 	to	love	space	.
you	could	build	your	own	satellite	and	get	it	 in 	 to 	 	space	for	like	8,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
think	how	much	money	and	how	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	it	took	nasa	to	get	 satellite 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
in	fact	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	for	nasa	,	and	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	pioneer	using	off	-	the	-	shelf	 component 	 s 	 	,	cheap	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	n't	 special 	 ized 	 	that	they	can	combine	and	 s 	 end 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
makers	are	a	source	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	and	i	think	it	 relat 	 es 	 	back	to	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	birth	of	the	personal	computer	industry	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	steve	wozniak	.	where	 do 	 es 	 	he	learn	about	 computer 	 s 	 	?
it	's	the	homebrew	computer	club	--	just	like	a	 hack 	 er 	 space 	 	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	could	go	there	all	day	long	and	talk	to	people	and	share	 idea 	 s 	 	for	free	.	``
well	he	did	a	little	bit	better	than	free	.
but	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	that	a	lot	of	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	our	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	--	even	like	henry	ford	--	come	from	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 play 	 ing 	 	and	 figur 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	out	in	 group 	 s 	 	.
well	,	if	i	have	n't	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	you	that	you	're	a	maker	,	i	hope	i	could	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	our	next	generation	should	be	makers	,	that	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	control	the	physical	world	and	be	able	to	use	 thing 	 s 	 	like	micro	-	 controll 	 ers 	 	and	build	 robot 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	got	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	or	 in 	 to 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	ways	--	the	ability	to	tinker	,	to	shape	and	 re 	 shape 	 	the	world	around	us	.
there	's	a	great	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	and	that	's	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	the	most	.
an	the	answer	to	the	question	:	what	will	america	make	?
it	's	more	makers	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
