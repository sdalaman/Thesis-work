so	,	now	,	there	are	a	lot	of	web	2.0	 consult 	 ants 	 	who	make	a	lot	of	money	.
in	fact	,	they	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 living 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	.
i	'm	going	to	try	and	 s 	 ave 	 	you	all	the	time	and	all	the	money	and	go	through	it	in	the	next	three	 minute 	 s 	 	,	so	bear	with	me	.
 start 	 ed 	 	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	back	in	2005	,	with	a	few	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	,	 call 	 ed 	 	reddit.com	.
that	's	what	you	'd	call	a	social	news	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	all	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	front	page	is	the	best	stuff	on	the	web	.	you	find	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	content	,	say	a	tedtalk	,	submit	it	to	reddit	,	and	the	community	of	your	 peer 	 s 	 	will	vote	it	up	if	they	like	it	,	vote	it	down	if	they	do	n't	.
and	that	 create 	 s 	 	the	front	page	.	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	,	 fall 	 ing 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	changing	.
about	a	half	million	people	visit	every	day	.	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	about	reddit	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	 discover 	 ing 	 	new	 thing 	 s 	 	that	pop	up	on	the	web	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 meme 	 s 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 trend 	 s 	 	get	born	right	on	our	front	page	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	even	about	reddit	 it 	 self 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	 hump 	 back 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	.
well	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 technical 	 ly 	 	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	greenpeace	,	which	is	an	 environment 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	 want 	 ed 	 	to	stop	the	japanese	government	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 whal 	 ing 	 	campaign	.
these	 hump 	 back 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	an	end	to	it	.	and	one	of	the	ways	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	was	to	put	a	 track 	 ing 	 	chip	 in 	 side 	 	one	of	these	 hump 	 back 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	.
but	to	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 person 	 ify 	 	the	 move 	 ment 	 	,	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	name	it	.
so	,	in	true	web	fashion	they	put	together	a	poll	where	they	had	a	bunch	of	 ver 	 y 	 	erudite	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 thought 	 ful 	 	,	 culture 	 d 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	farsi	word	for	``	 im 	 mortal 	 	.	``
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	``	divine	power	of	the	ocean	``	in	a	polynesian	language	.
and	then	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	 mis 	 ter 	 	splashy	pants	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	special	.	 mis 	 ter 	 	pants	,	or	splashy	,	to	his	 friend 	 s 	 	,	was	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
in	fact	,	 some 	 one 	 	on	reddit	thought	,	``	oh	,	what	a	great	thing	,	we	should	all	vote	 th 	 is 	 	up	.	``
and	,	you	know	,	redditors	 respond 	 ed 	 	and	all	 agree 	 d 	 	.
so	,	the	 vot 	 ing 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	 be 	 hind 	 	it	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	 change 	 d 	 	our	logo	,	for	the	day	,	from	the	alien	to	a	splashy	,	to	sort	of	help	the	cause	.
and	it	was	n't	long	before	other	 s 	 ites 	 	like	fark	and	 bo 	 ing 	 	 bo 	 ing 	 	and	the	rest	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	!	we	love	splashy	pants	.	``
so	,	it	went	from	about	five	percent	,	which	was	when	 th 	 is 	 	meme	 start 	 ed 	 	,	to	70	percent	at	the	end	of	 vot 	 ing 	 	.
which	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	right	?	we	won	!	 mis 	 ter 	 	splashy	pants	was	 chose 	 n 	 	.	hmm	,	just	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	,	greenpeace	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	n't	that	crazy	about	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	more	 thought 	 ful 	 	 name 	 s 	 	to	win	.
so	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	just	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.	we	'll	give	it	 an 	 other 	 	week	of	 vot 	 ing 	 	.	``
well	,	that	got	us	a	little	 ang 	 ry 	 	.
so	,	we	 change 	 d 	 	it	to	fightin	'	splashy	.
and	the	reddit	community	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	and	the	rest	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	got	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
facebook	 group 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 create 	 d 	 	.	facebook	 application 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 create 	 d 	 	.
the	idea	was	,	``	vote	your	 con 	 science 	 	,	``	vote	for	 mis 	 ter 	 	splashy	pants	.
and	people	 we 	 re 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	up	 sign 	 s 	 	in	the	real	world	--	--	about	 th 	 is 	 	whale	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	final	vote	.	when	all	was	 clear 	 ed 	 	...
78	percent	of	the	 vote 	 s 	 	,	and	to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	 land 	 slide 	 	,	the	next	highest	name	 pull 	 ed 	 	in	three	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
so	,	there	was	a	clear	 less 	 on 	 	here	.
and	that	was	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 love 	 s 	 	 mis 	 ter 	 	splashy	pants	.
which	is	obvious	.	it	's	a	great	name	.
 every 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	hear	 the 	 ir 	 	news	anchor	say	,	``	 mis 	 ter 	 	splashy	pants	.	``
and	i	think	that	's	what	 help 	 ed 	 	drive	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	what	was	cool	was	that	the	 re 	 percuss 	 ions 	 	now	for	greenpeace	was	,	they	 create 	 d 	 	an	entire	 market 	 ing 	 	campaign	around	it	.
they	sell	 mis 	 ter 	 	splashy	pants	 shirt 	 s 	 	and	 pin 	 s 	 	.
they	even	 create 	 d 	 	an	 e 	 - 	 card 	 	so	you	could	 s 	 end 	 	your	friend	a	 danc 	 ing 	 	splashy	.
but	what	was	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	was	the	fact	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mission	.	the	japanese	government	 call 	 ed 	 	off	 the 	 ir 	 	 whal 	 ing 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	.	mission	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	.
greenpeace	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	.	the	 whale 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	happy	.	that	's	a	quote	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	redditors	in	the	 inter 	 net 	 	community	 we 	 re 	 	happy	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	whale	 lover 	 s 	 	.
a	few	of	them	 certain 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.	but	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	lot	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	just	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	caught	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	great	meme	,	and	in	fact	 some 	 one 	 	from	greenpeace	came	back	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	and	 thank 	 ed 	 	reddit	for	 it 	 s 	 	 particip 	 ation 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	out	of	 al 	 truism 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	just	out	of	interest	in	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	cool	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	how	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	that	great	big	secret	.	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 provide 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	level	 play 	 ing 	 	field	.
your	link	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	your	link	,	which	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	my	link	.	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	a	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	,	 any 	 one 	 	can	get	to	any	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	no	matter	how	big	a	budget	you	have	.
that	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	keep	net	 neutral 	 ity 	 	in	place	.
the	other	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	that	it	 cost 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	get	that	content	 on 	 line 	 	now	.
there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	great	 publish 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	that	are	 avail 	 able 	 	,	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	of	your	time	now	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	the	cost	of	iteration	is	so	cheap	that	you	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	give	it	a	go	.
and	if	you	do	,	be	genuine	about	it	.	be	honest	.	be	up	front	.
and	one	of	the	great	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	that	greenpeace	 actual 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	lose	control	.
it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	take	 your 	 self 	 	a	little	less	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	that	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	cause	,	you	could	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	your	final	goal	.
and	that	's	the	final	 mess 	 age 	 	that	i	want	to	share	with	all	of	you	--	that	you	can	do	well	 on 	 line 	 	.
but	no	 long 	 er 	 	is	the	 mess 	 age 	 	going	to	be	coming	from	just	the	top	down	.
if	you	want	to	succeed	you	've	got	to	be	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	just	lose	control	.
thank	you	.
