so	,	i	'll	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	:	a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	an	event	 plan 	 ner 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	me	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	going	to	do	a	 s 	 peaking 	 	event	.
and	she	 call 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	how	to	write	about	you	on	the	little	 fli 	 er 	 	.	``
and	i	thought	,	``	well	,	what	's	the	struggle	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	saw	you	speak	,	and	i	'm	going	to	call	you	a	 research 	 er 	 	,	i	think	,	but	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	if	i	call	you	a	 research 	 er 	 	,	no	one	will	come	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	'll	think	you	're	 bor 	 ing 	 	and	 ir 	 relevant 	 	.	``
and	i	was	like	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	the	thing	i	 like 	 d 	 	about	your	talk	is	you	're	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.
so	i	think	what	i	'll	do	is	just	call	you	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.	``
and	of	course	,	the	academic	,	 in 	 secure 	 	part	of	me	was	like	,	``	you	're	going	to	call	me	a	what	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	call	you	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.	``
and	i	was	like	,	``	why	not	magic	 pi 	 xie 	 	?	``
i	was	like	,	``	let	me	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	second	.	``
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	call	deep	on	my	courage	.
and	i	thought	,	you	know	,	i	am	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.
i	'm	a	 qual 	 itative 	 	 research 	 er 	 	.
i	collect	 st 	 ories 	 	;	that	's	what	i	do	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	are	just	data	with	a	soul	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	i	'm	just	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.
and	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	?
why	do	n't	you	just	say	i	'm	a	 research 	 er 	 	-	 story 	 teller 	 	.	``
and	she	went	,	``	haha	.	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	.	``
so	i	'm	a	 research 	 er 	 	-	 story 	 teller 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	--	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 expand 	 ing 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	--	and	so	i	want	to	talk	to	you	and	tell	some	 st 	 ories 	 	about	a	piece	of	my	research	that	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 expand 	 ed 	 	my	 per 	 ception 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	that	i	live	and	love	and	work	and	parent	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	my	story	 start 	 s 	 	.
when	i	was	a	young	 research 	 er 	 	,	 doctor 	 al 	 	student	,	my	first	year	i	had	a	research	professor	who	 s 	 aid 	 	to	us	,	``	here	's	the	thing	,	if	you	can	not	measure	it	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	exist	.	``
and	i	thought	he	was	just	sweet	-	 talk 	 ing 	 	me	.
i	was	like	,	``	 re 	 ally 	 	?	``	and	he	was	like	,	``	 absolute 	 ly 	 	.	``
and	so	you	have	to	understand	that	i	have	a	bachelor	's	in	social	work	,	a	master	's	in	social	work	,	and	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	my	ph.d.	in	social	work	,	so	my	entire	academic	 care 	 er 	 	was	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	people	who	kind	of	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	the	``	life	's	 mess 	 y 	 	,	love	it	.	``
and	i	'm	more	of	the	,	``	life	's	 mess 	 y 	 	,	clean	it	up	,	organize	it	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 bent 	 o 	 	box	.	``
and	so	to	think	that	i	had	found	my	way	,	to	found	a	 care 	 er 	 	that	 take 	 s 	 	me	--	 re 	 ally 	 	,	one	of	the	big	 say 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	social	work	is	,	``	lean	 in 	 to 	 	the	 dis 	 comfort 	 	of	the	work	.	``
and	i	'm	like	,	knock	 dis 	 comfort 	 	 up 	 side 	 	the	head	and	move	it	over	and	get	all	a	's	.
that	was	my	 man 	 tra 	 	.
so	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	i	thought	,	you	know	what	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 care 	 er 	 	for	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	some	 mess 	 y 	 	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
but	i	want	to	be	able	to	make	them	not	 mess 	 y 	 	.
i	want	to	understand	them	.
i	want	to	hack	 in 	 to 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	i	know	are	 import 	 ant 	 	and	lay	the	code	out	for	 every 	 one 	 	to	see	.
so	where	i	 start 	 ed 	 	was	with	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	by	the	time	you	're	a	social	 work 	 er 	 	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	what	you	 real 	 ize 	 	is	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	why	we	're	here	.
it	's	what	 give 	 s 	 	purpose	and	meaning	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	's	all	about	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 whet 	 her 	 	you	talk	to	people	who	work	in	social	justice	and	mental	health	and	abuse	and	neglect	,	what	we	know	is	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	the	ability	to	feel	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	is	--	 neuro 	 bio 	 logically 	 	that	's	how	we	're	wired	--	it	's	why	we	're	here	.
so	i	thought	,	you	know	what	,	i	'm	going	to	start	with	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
well	,	you	know	that	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	you	get	an	 evalu 	 ation 	 	from	your	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	,	and	she	 tell 	 s 	 	you	37	 thing 	 s 	 	you	do	 re 	 ally 	 	awesome	,	and	one	thing	--	an	``	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	growth	?	``
and	all	you	can	think	about	is	that	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	growth	,	right	?
well	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	my	work	went	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	when	you	ask	people	about	love	,	they	tell	you	about	 heart 	 break 	 	.
when	you	ask	people	about	 belong 	 ing 	 	,	they	'll	tell	you	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 excruciat 	 ing 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 exclude 	 d 	 	.
and	when	you	ask	people	about	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	the	 st 	 ories 	 	they	told	me	 we 	 re 	 	about	 dis 	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
so	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	--	 re 	 ally 	 	about	six	 week 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	research	--	i	ran	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 named 	 	thing	that	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 unravel 	 ed 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	in	a	way	that	i	did	n't	understand	or	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	.
and	so	i	 pull 	 ed 	 	back	out	of	the	research	and	thought	,	i	need	to	figure	out	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	shame	.
and	shame	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	fear	of	 dis 	 connect 	 ion 	 	:	is	there	 some 	 thing 	 	about	me	that	,	if	other	people	know	it	or	see	it	,	that	i	wo	n't	be	worthy	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	?
the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	can	tell	you	about	it	:	it	's	universal	;	we	all	have	it	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	who	do	n't	experience	shame	have	no	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	human	 empath 	 y 	 	or	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
no	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	talk	about	it	,	and	the	less	you	talk	about	it	the	more	you	have	it	.
what	 under 	 pin 	 ned 	 	 th 	 is 	 	shame	,	 th 	 is 	 	``	i	'm	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	,	``	--	which	we	all	know	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	:	``	i	'm	not	blank	 en 	 ough 	 	.	i	'm	not	thin	 en 	 ough 	 	,	rich	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 promote 	 d 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.	``
the	thing	that	 under 	 pin 	 ned 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	 excruciat 	 ing 	 	 vulner 	 ability 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	,	in	order	for	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	happen	,	we	have	to	allow	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 een 	 	.
and	you	know	how	i	feel	about	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.	i	hate	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.
and	so	i	thought	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	chance	to	beat	it	back	with	my	 measur 	 ing 	 	stick	.
i	'm	going	in	,	i	'm	going	to	figure	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	out	,	i	'm	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	year	,	i	'm	going	to	 total 	 ly 	 	 de 	 construct 	 	shame	,	i	'm	going	to	understand	how	 vulner 	 ability 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	 out 	 smart 	 	it	.
so	i	was	ready	,	and	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	it	's	not	going	to	turn	out	well	.
you	know	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	i	could	tell	you	a	lot	about	shame	,	but	i	'd	have	to	borrow	 every 	 one 	 	else	's	time	.
but	here	's	what	i	can	tell	you	that	it	 boil 	 s 	 	down	to	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	ever	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	the	decade	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	research	.
my	one	year	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	six	 year 	 s 	 	:	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	long	 interview 	 s 	 	,	focus	 group 	 s 	 	.
at	one	point	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	me	journal	 page 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	me	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	--	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 piece 	 s 	 	of	data	in	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	kind	of	got	a	handle	on	it	.
i	kind	of	 under 	 stood 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	shame	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
i	wrote	a	book	,	i	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	 theor 	 y 	 	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	was	not	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	--	and	what	it	was	is	that	,	if	i	 rough 	 ly 	 	took	the	people	i	 interview 	 ed 	 	and	 divid 	 ed 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	people	who	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	sense	of	 worth 	 iness 	 	--	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	,	a	sense	of	 worth 	 iness 	 	--	they	have	a	strong	sense	of	love	and	 belong 	 ing 	 	--	and	 folk 	 s 	 	who	struggle	for	it	,	and	 folk 	 s 	 	who	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	if	they	're	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
there	was	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 vari 	 able 	 	that	 separat 	 ed 	 	the	people	who	have	a	strong	sense	of	love	and	 belong 	 ing 	 	and	the	people	who	 re 	 ally 	 	struggle	for	it	.
and	that	was	,	the	people	who	have	a	strong	sense	of	love	and	 belong 	 ing 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	they	're	worthy	of	love	and	 belong 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	it	.
they	 believ 	 e 	 	they	're	worthy	.
and	to	me	,	the	hard	part	of	the	one	thing	that	 keep 	 s 	 	us	out	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	our	fear	that	we	're	not	worthy	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	 personal 	 ly 	 	and	 professional 	 ly 	 	,	i	felt	like	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	understand	better	.
so	what	i	did	is	i	took	all	of	the	 interview 	 s 	 	where	i	saw	 worth 	 iness 	 	,	where	i	saw	people	living	that	way	,	and	just	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 t 	 hose 	 	.
what	do	these	people	have	in	common	?
i	have	a	 s 	 light 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	supply	 addict 	 ion 	 	,	but	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	talk	.
so	i	had	a	 man 	 ila 	 	 fold 	 er 	 	,	and	i	had	a	sharpie	,	and	i	was	like	,	what	am	i	going	to	call	 th 	 is 	 	research	?
and	the	first	 word 	 s 	 	that	came	to	my	mind	 we 	 re 	 	whole	-	hearted	.
these	are	whole	-	hearted	people	,	living	from	 th 	 is 	 	deep	sense	of	 worth 	 iness 	 	.
so	i	wrote	at	the	top	of	the	 man 	 ila 	 	 fold 	 er 	 	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	the	data	.
in	fact	,	i	did	it	first	in	a	four	-	day	 ver 	 y 	 	intensive	data	analysis	,	where	i	went	back	,	 pull 	 ed 	 	these	 interview 	 s 	 	,	 pull 	 ed 	 	the	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 pull 	 ed 	 	the	 incident 	 s 	 	.
what	's	the	theme	?	what	's	the	pattern	?
my	husband	left	town	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 al 	 ways 	 	go	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	jackson	pollock	crazy	thing	,	where	i	'm	just	like	writing	and	in	my	 research 	 er 	 	mode	.
and	so	here	's	what	i	found	.
what	they	had	in	common	was	a	sense	of	courage	.
and	i	want	to	 separat 	 e 	 	courage	and	 brave 	 ry 	 	for	you	for	a	minute	.
courage	,	the	original	definition	of	courage	,	when	it	first	came	 in 	 to 	 	the	english	language	--	it	's	from	the	latin	word	cor	,	meaning	heart	--	and	the	original	definition	was	to	tell	the	story	of	who	you	are	with	your	whole	heart	.
and	so	these	 folk 	 s 	 	had	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	the	courage	to	be	 im 	 perfect 	 	.
they	had	the	 compass 	 ion 	 	to	be	kind	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	first	and	then	to	 other 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	we	ca	n't	practice	 compass 	 ion 	 	with	other	people	if	we	ca	n't	treat	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 kind 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	last	was	they	had	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	and	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	hard	part	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 authentic 	 ity 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	let	go	of	who	they	thought	they	should	be	in	order	to	be	who	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	which	you	have	to	 absolute 	 ly 	 	do	that	for	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
the	other	thing	that	they	had	in	common	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	they	fully	 embrace 	 d 	 	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.
they	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	what	made	them	 vulner 	 able 	 	made	them	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
they	did	n't	talk	about	 vulner 	 ability 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	nor	did	they	 re 	 ally 	 	talk	about	it	 be 	 ing 	 	 excruciat 	 ing 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	i	had	heard	it	 ear 	 lier 	 	in	the	shame	 interview 	 ing 	 	.
they	just	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	 be 	 ing 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	say	,	``	i	love	you	``	first	,	the	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	where	there	are	no	 guarantee 	 s 	 	,	the	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	breathe	through	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	doctor	to	call	after	your	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	.
they	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	invest	in	a	relationship	that	may	or	may	not	work	out	.
they	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	fundamental	.
i	 personal 	 ly 	 	thought	it	was	 betray 	 al 	 	.
i	could	not	 believ 	 e 	 	i	had	 pledg 	 ed 	 	allegiance	to	research	,	where	our	job	--	you	know	,	the	definition	of	research	is	to	control	and	predict	,	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	,	for	the	 ex 	 plicit 	 	reason	to	control	and	predict	.
and	now	my	mission	to	control	and	predict	had	 turn 	 ed 	 	up	the	answer	that	the	way	to	live	is	with	 vulner 	 ability 	 	and	to	stop	 controll 	 ing 	 	and	 predict 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	led	to	a	little	 break 	 down 	 	--	--	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	it	did	.
i	call	it	a	 break 	 down 	 	;	my	therapist	 call 	 s 	 	it	a	spiritual	 awake 	 ning 	 	.
a	spiritual	 awake 	 ning 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	better	than	 break 	 down 	 	,	but	i	assure	you	it	was	a	 break 	 down 	 	.
and	i	had	to	put	my	data	away	and	go	find	a	therapist	.
let	me	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	:	you	know	who	you	are	when	you	call	your	 friend 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	i	think	i	need	to	see	 some 	 body 	 	.
do	you	have	any	 recommend 	 ations 	 	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	about	five	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	wooo	.	i	would	n't	want	to	be	your	therapist	.	``
i	was	like	,	``	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?	``
and	they	're	like	,	``	i	'm	just	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	.
do	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	your	 measur 	 ing 	 	stick	.	``
i	was	like	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	``
so	i	found	a	therapist	.
my	first	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	her	,	diana	--	i	 br 	 ought 	 	in	my	list	of	the	way	the	whole	-	hearted	live	,	and	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	are	you	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	great	.	i	'm	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	going	on	?	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	therapist	who	 s 	 ees 	 	 therapist 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	to	go	to	 t 	 hose 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	b.s	.	 meter 	 s 	 	are	good	.
and	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	here	's	the	thing	,	i	'm	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	.	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	the	struggle	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	have	a	 vulner 	 ability 	 	issue	.
and	i	know	that	 vulner 	 ability 	 	is	the	core	of	shame	and	fear	and	our	struggle	for	 worth 	 iness 	 	,	but	it	 appear 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	 birth 	 place 	 	of	joy	,	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	of	 belong 	 ing 	 	,	of	love	.
and	i	think	i	have	a	problem	,	and	i	need	some	help	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	here	's	the	thing	:	no	family	stuff	,	no	 child 	 hood 	 	shit	.	``
``	i	just	need	some	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.	``
thank	you	.
so	she	 go 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	bad	,	right	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	 n 	 either 	 	good	nor	bad	.	``
``	it	just	is	what	it	is	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	my	god	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	suck	.	``
and	it	did	,	and	it	did	n't	.
and	it	took	about	a	year	.
and	you	know	how	there	are	people	that	,	when	they	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 vulner 	 ability 	 	and	 tender 	 ness 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	,	that	they	surrender	and	walk	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
a	:	that	's	not	me	,	and	b	:	i	do	n't	even	hang	out	with	people	like	that	.
for	me	,	it	was	a	 year 	 long 	 	street	fight	.
it	was	a	 slug 	 fest 	 	.
 vulner 	 ability 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	,	i	 push 	 ed 	 	back	.
i	lost	the	fight	,	but	 prob 	 ably 	 	won	my	life	back	.
and	so	then	i	went	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	research	and	 s 	 pent 	 	the	next	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	what	they	,	the	whole	-	hearted	,	what	 choice 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	making	,	and	what	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	with	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.
why	do	we	struggle	with	it	so	much	?
am	i	 al 	 one 	 	in	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	 vulner 	 ability 	 	?
no	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
we	numb	 vulner 	 ability 	 	--	when	we	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	call	.
it	was	funny	,	i	 s 	 ent 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	out	on	twitter	and	on	facebook	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	how	would	you	define	 vulner 	 ability 	 	?
what	 make 	 s 	 	you	feel	 vulner 	 able 	 	?	``
and	 with 	 in 	 	an	hour	and	a	half	,	i	had	150	 respons 	 es 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	what	's	out	there	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	to	ask	my	husband	for	help	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	sick	,	and	we	're	 new 	 ly 	 	married	;	 initi 	 ating 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	with	my	husband	;	 initi 	 ating 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	with	my	wife	;	 be 	 ing 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	down	;	 ask 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	out	;	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	doctor	to	call	back	;	 get 	 ting 	 	laid	off	;	 lay 	 ing 	 	off	people	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	we	live	in	.
we	live	in	a	 vulner 	 able 	 	world	.
and	one	of	the	ways	we	deal	with	it	is	we	numb	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.
and	i	think	there	's	evidence	--	and	it	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	reason	 th 	 is 	 	evidence	 exist 	 s 	 	,	but	i	think	it	's	a	huge	cause	--	we	are	the	most	in	-	debt	,	 obes 	 e 	 	,	 addict 	 ed 	 	and	 medic 	 ated 	 	adult	cohort	in	u.s.	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
the	problem	is	--	and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	from	the	research	--	that	you	can	not	 select 	 ively 	 	numb	emotion	.
you	ca	n't	say	,	here	's	the	bad	stuff	.
here	's	 vulner 	 ability 	 	,	here	's	grief	,	here	's	shame	,	here	's	fear	,	here	's	 disappoint 	 ment 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	to	feel	these	.
i	'm	going	to	have	a	couple	of	 beer 	 s 	 	and	a	banana	nut	muffin	.
i	do	n't	want	to	feel	these	.
and	i	know	that	's	 know 	 ing 	 	laughter	.
i	hack	 in 	 to 	 	your	 live 	 s 	 	for	a	living	.
god	.
you	ca	n't	numb	 t 	 hose 	 	hard	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 numb 	 ing 	 	the	other	 affect 	 s 	 	,	our	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
you	can	not	 select 	 ively 	 	numb	.
so	when	we	numb	 t 	 hose 	 	,	we	numb	joy	,	we	numb	 grat 	 itude 	 	,	we	numb	happiness	.
and	then	we	are	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	,	and	we	are	looking	for	purpose	and	meaning	,	and	then	we	feel	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	so	then	we	have	a	couple	of	 beer 	 s 	 	and	a	banana	nut	muffin	.
and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	cycle	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	think	we	need	to	think	about	is	why	and	how	we	numb	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	have	to	be	 addict 	 ion 	 	.
the	other	thing	we	do	is	we	make	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	 un 	 certain 	 	certain	.
 relig 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	from	a	belief	in	faith	and	 myster 	 y 	 	to	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
i	'm	right	,	you	're	wrong	.	shut	up	.
that	's	it	.
just	certain	.
the	more	 af 	 raid 	 	we	are	,	the	more	 vulner 	 able 	 	we	are	,	the	more	 af 	 raid 	 	we	are	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 politic 	 s 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	 to 	 day 	 	.
there	's	no	 dis 	 course 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
there	's	no	conversation	.
there	's	just	blame	.
you	know	how	blame	is	 de 	 scribed 	 	in	the	research	?
a	way	to	 dis 	 charge 	 	pain	and	 dis 	 comfort 	 	.
we	perfect	.
if	there	's	 any 	 one 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	would	be	me	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	do	is	we	take	fat	from	our	 butt 	 s 	 	and	put	it	in	our	 cheek 	 s 	 	.
which	just	,	i	hope	in	100	 year 	 s 	 	,	people	will	look	back	and	go	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	.	``
and	we	perfect	,	most	 danger 	 ously 	 	,	our	children	.
let	me	tell	you	what	we	think	about	children	.
they	're	 hard 	 wired 	 	for	struggle	when	they	get	here	.
and	when	you	hold	 t 	 hose 	 	perfect	little	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	your	hand	,	our	job	is	not	to	say	,	``	look	at	her	,	she	's	perfect	.
my	job	is	just	to	keep	her	perfect	--	make	 s 	 ure 	 	she	 make 	 s 	 	the	tennis	team	by	fifth	grade	and	yale	by	 seven 	 th 	 	grade	.	``
that	's	not	our	job	.
our	job	is	to	look	and	say	,	``	you	know	what	?	you	're	 im 	 perfect 	 	,	and	you	're	wired	for	struggle	,	but	you	are	worthy	of	love	and	 belong 	 ing 	 	.	``
that	's	our	job	.
show	me	a	generation	of	 kid 	 s 	 	raised	like	that	,	and	we	'll	end	the	 problem 	 s 	 	i	think	that	we	see	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	pretend	that	what	we	do	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	an	effect	on	people	.
we	do	that	in	our	personal	 live 	 s 	 	.
we	do	that	corporate	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	 bail 	 out 	 	,	an	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	,	a	recall	--	we	pretend	like	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	huge	impact	on	other	people	.
i	would	say	to	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	our	first	rodeo	,	people	.
we	just	need	you	to	be	authentic	and	real	and	say	,	``	we	're	sorry	.
we	'll	fix	it	.	``
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	way	,	and	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	have	found	:	to	let	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	be	 s 	 een 	 	,	 deep 	 ly 	 	 s 	 een 	 	,	 vulner 	 ably 	 	 s 	 een 	 	;	to	love	with	our	whole	 heart 	 s 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	there	's	no	guarantee	--	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	,	and	i	can	tell	you	 a 	 s 	 	a	parent	,	that	's	 excruciat 	 ing 	 ly 	 	difficult	--	to	practice	 grat 	 itude 	 	and	joy	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	terror	,	when	we	're	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	``	can	i	love	you	 th 	 is 	 	much	?
can	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	?
can	i	be	 th 	 is 	 	fierce	about	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
just	to	be	able	to	stop	and	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 catastroph 	 izing 	 	what	might	happen	,	to	say	,	``	i	'm	just	so	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	to	feel	 th 	 is 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	i	'm	 al 	 ive 	 	.	``
and	the	last	,	which	i	think	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	is	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	're	 en 	 ough 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	work	from	a	place	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	 en 	 ough 	 	,	``	then	we	stop	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	and	start	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	we	're	 kind 	 er 	 	and	 gentle 	 r 	 	to	the	people	around	us	,	and	we	're	 kind 	 er 	 	and	 gentle 	 r 	 	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
that	's	all	i	have	.	thank	you	.
