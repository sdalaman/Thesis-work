i	love	 tree 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	live	near	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	arboretum	,	and	sundays	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	i	'd	go	there	with	my	wife	and	now	,	with	my	four	-	year	-	old	,	and	we	'd	climb	in	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	we	'd	play	hide	and	seek	.
the	second	school	i	was	at	had	big	 tree 	 s 	 	too	,	had	a	fantastic	tulip	tree	,	i	think	it	was	the	 big 	 gest 	 	in	the	country	,	and	it	 al 	 so 	 	had	a	lot	of	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 bush 	 es 	 	and	 veget 	 ation 	 	around	it	,	around	the	 play 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	.
one	day	i	was	 grab 	 bed 	 	by	some	of	my	 class 	 mate 	 s 	 	,	and	taken	in	the	 bush 	 es 	 	--	i	was	 strip 	 ped 	 	;	i	was	 attack 	 ed 	 	;	i	was	 abuse 	 d 	 	;	and	 th 	 is 	 	came	out	of	the	blue	.
now	,	the	reason	i	say	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	--	well	,	i	went	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	school	--	i	felt	 dirt 	 y 	 	;	i	felt	 betray 	 ed 	 	;	i	felt	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	,	but	 main 	 ly 	 	--	 main 	 ly 	 	,	i	felt	 power 	 less 	 	.
and	30	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	an	 air 	 plane 	 	,	next	to	a	 lad 	 y 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	veronica	,	who	came	from	chile	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	on	a	human	 right 	 s 	 	tour	,	and	she	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	tell	me	what	it	was	like	to	be	 torture 	 d 	 	,	and	,	from	my	 ver 	 y 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	position	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ference 	 	point	that	i	had	.
and	it	was	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	experience	 be 	 cause 	 	,	for	me	,	human	 right 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	which	i	had	,	you	know	,	a	part	-	time	interest	,	but	,	 main 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	other	people	over	there	.
but	i	got	a	phone	call	from	bono	in	1985	and	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	he	's	a	great	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	,	but	he	's	a	 magnific 	 ent 	 	hustler	,	and	--	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	guy	to	say	no	to	,	and	he	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	just	after	i	'd	 d 	 one 	 	the	biko	song	,	we	're	going	to	do	a	tour	for	amnesty	,	you	have	to	be	on	it	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	that	was	the	first	time	that	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	out	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	people	who	'd	 watch 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	family	 be 	 ing 	 	shot	in	front	of	them	,	who	'd	had	a	partner	 throw 	 n 	 	out	of	an	 air 	 plane 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	ocean	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	of	human	 right 	 s 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	my	world	,	and	i	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	walk	away	in	 quit 	 e 	 	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	before	.
so	i	got	 involve 	 d 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	tour	,	which	was	for	amnesty	,	and	then	in	'88	i	took	over	bono	's	job	 try 	 ing 	 	to	learn	how	to	hustle	.
i	did	n't	do	it	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	but	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	youssou	n'dour	,	 s 	 ting 	 	,	tracy	chapman	,	and	bruce	springsteen	to	go	'	round	the	world	for	amnesty	,	and	it	was	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	experience	.
and	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	got	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	education	,	and	it	was	the	first	time	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	that	i	'd	met	a	lot	of	these	people	in	the	different	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	these	human	 right 	 s 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	physical	,	and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	walk	away	 quit 	 e 	 	so	 comfort 	 ably 	 	.
but	the	thing	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	me	,	that	i	had	no	idea	,	was	that	you	could	suffer	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	and	then	have	your	whole	experience	,	your	story	,	 deni 	 ed 	 	,	buried	and	 for 	 gotten 	 	.
and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	that	 when 	 ever 	 	there	was	a	camera	around	,	or	a	video	or	film	camera	,	it	was	a	great	deal	 hard 	 er 	 	to	do	--	for	 t 	 hose 	 	in	power	to	bury	the	story	.
and	reebok	set	up	a	 found 	 ation 	 	after	these	human	 right 	 s 	 	now	 tour 	 s 	 	and	there	was	a	decision	then	--	well	,	we	made	a	proposal	,	for	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	set	up	a	division	that	was	going	to	give	 camera 	 s 	 	to	human	 right 	 s 	 	 activist 	 s 	 	.
it	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	get	 any 	 where 	 	,	and	then	the	rodney	king	incident	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	and	people	thought	,	ok	,	if	you	have	a	camera	in	the	right	place	at	the	right	time	,	or	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	the	wrong	time	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	who	you	are	,	then	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	 campaign 	 ing 	 	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	heard	,	and	 tell 	 ing 	 	people	about	what	's	going	on	.
so	,	witness	was	 start 	 ed 	 	in	'92	and	it	's	since	 give 	 n 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	out	in	over	60	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	we	campaign	with	activist	 group 	 s 	 	and	help	them	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	story	and	,	in	fact	,	i	will	show	you	in	a	moment	one	of	the	most	 re 	 cent 	 	 campaign 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	it	's	a	story	from	uganda	,	and	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	had	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	story	from	uganda	 yester 	 day 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	so	good	.

peter	gabriel	:	so	torture	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	on	other	 s 	 oil 	 	.
