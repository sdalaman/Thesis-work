i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	my	work	on	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	.
now	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	when	i	 ment 	 ion 	 	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	people	will	flash	me	the	vulcan	sign	and	laugh	.
but	now	,	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 gor 	 king 	 	people	out	to	fly	to	mars	or	even	pandora	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 f 	 un 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	may	be	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	using	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	to	help	people	out	in	trauma	.
so	what	do	i	mean	when	i	say	``	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	``	?
it	is	the	process	by	which	 animal 	 s 	 	de	-	animate	,	appear	dead	and	then	can	wake	up	 aga 	 in 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 harm 	 ed 	 	.
ok	,	so	here	is	the	sort	of	big	idea	:	if	you	look	out	at	nature	,	you	find	that	 a 	 s 	 	you	tend	to	see	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	you	tend	to	see	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
and	so	,	what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	is	a	way	to	tell	a	person	who	's	in	trauma	--	find	a	way	to	de	-	animate	them	a	bit	so	they	're	a	little	more	 im 	 mortal 	 	when	they	have	that	heart	attack	.
an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	an	organism	or	two	that	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 im 	 mortal 	 	would	be	plant	 seed 	 s 	 	or	bacterial	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
these	 creature 	 s 	 	are	some	of	the	most	 im 	 mortal 	 	life	 form 	 s 	 	on	our	planet	,	and	they	tend	to	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	in	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	.
bacterial	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	are	thought	now	by	 scientist 	 s 	 	to	exist	 a 	 s 	 	individual	 cell 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ive 	 	,	but	in	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	for	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	250	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
to	suggest	that	 th 	 is 	 	all	,	sort	of	,	about	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	,	i	want	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	close	to	home	.
in	the	 im 	 mortal 	 	germ	line	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	that	is	,	the	 egg 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 it 	 	in	the	 ov 	 aries 	 	--	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 it 	 	there	in	a	state	of	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	for	up	to	50	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	life	of	each	woman	.
so	then	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	sea	-	 monkey 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	with	children	,	you	know	about	them	.
you	go	to	the	pet	store	or	the	 to 	 y 	 	store	,	and	you	can	buy	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	just	open	the	bag	,	and	you	just	dump	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	plastic	 aqua 	 rium 	 	,	and	in	about	a	week	or	so	,	you	'll	have	little	 shrimp 	 s 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	around	.
well	,	i	was	n't	so	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	what	was	going	on	in	the	bag	,	the	bag	on	the	 to 	 y 	 	store	shelf	where	 t 	 hose 	 	shrimp	 s 	 at 	 	in	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	 in 	 definite 	 ly 	 	.
so	these	 idea 	 s 	 	of	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	are	not	just	about	 cell 	 s 	 	and	weird	,	little	 organism 	 s 	 	.
 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 brief 	 ly 	 	de	-	 animate 	 d 	 	,	and	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	people	who	are	 brief 	 ly 	 	de	-	 animate 	 d 	 	that	interest	me	the	most	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	the	cold	.
ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	was	a	 ski 	 er 	 	in	norway	that	was	trapped	in	an	 ic 	 y 	 	 water 	 fall 	 	,	and	she	was	there	for	two	 hour 	 s 	 	before	they	 extra 	 cted 	 	her	.
she	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	cold	,	and	she	had	no	 heart 	 beat 	 	--	for	all	 intent 	 s 	 	and	 purpose 	 s 	 	she	was	dead	,	 froze 	 n 	 	.
seven	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	still	 with 	 out 	 	a	 heart 	 beat 	 	,	they	 br 	 ought 	 	her	back	to	life	,	and	she	went	on	to	be	the	head	 radio 	 logist 	 	in	the	hospital	that	 treat 	 ed 	 	her	.
a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	so	i	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	about	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	there	was	a	13	-	month	-	old	,	she	was	from	canada	.
her	father	had	gone	out	in	the	 winter 	 time 	 	;	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	night	shift	,	and	she	 follow 	 ed 	 	him	 out 	 side 	 	in	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	a	 dia 	 per 	 	.
and	they	found	her	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 froze 	 n 	 	,	 life 	 less 	 	,	and	they	 br 	 ought 	 	her	back	to	life	.
there	was	a	65	-	year	-	old	woman	in	duluth	,	minnesota	last	year	that	was	found	 froze 	 n 	 	and	 with 	 out 	 	a	 puls 	 e 	 	in	her	front	yard	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	in	the	winter	,	and	they	 br 	 ought 	 	her	back	to	life	.
the	next	day	,	she	was	 do 	 ing 	 	so	well	,	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	run	 test 	 s 	 	on	her	.
she	got	 crank 	 y 	 	and	just	went	home	.
so	,	these	are	 miracle 	 s 	 	,	right	?
these	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	 miracul 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	happen	.
 doctor 	 s 	 	have	a	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	in	fact	,	``	you	're	not	dead	 un 	 til 	 	you	're	warm	and	dead	.	``
and	it	's	true	.	it	's	true	.
in	the	new	england	journal	of	medicine	,	there	was	a	 stud 	 y 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	that	 show 	 ed 	 	that	with	appropriate	 re 	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	people	who	had	 suffer 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	 heart 	 beat 	 	for	three	 hour 	 s 	 	could	be	 br 	 ought 	 	back	to	life	 with 	 out 	 	any	 neuro 	 logic 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
that	's	over	50	percent	.
so	what	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	think	of	a	way	that	we	could	 stud 	 y 	 	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	to	think	about	a	way	to	 re 	 produce 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 ski 	 er 	 	.
well	,	i	have	to	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	odd	,	and	that	is	that	 be 	 ing 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	low	oxygen	 do 	 es 	 	not	 al 	 ways 	 	kill	.
so	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	there	's	20	percent	oxygen	or	so	,	and	if	we	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	oxygen	 concent 	 ration 	 	,	we	will	all	be	dead	.
and	,	in	fact	,	the	 animal 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	in	the	lab	--	these	little	garden	 worm 	 s 	 	,	 nematode 	 s 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	dead	when	we	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	them	to	low	oxygen	.
and	here	's	the	thing	that	should	freak	you	out	.
and	that	is	that	,	when	we	lower	the	oxygen	 concent 	 ration 	 	further	by	100	 time 	 s 	 	,	to	10	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	dead	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	and	we	could	 br 	 ing 	 	them	back	to	life	 with 	 out 	 	any	harm	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	precise	oxygen	 concent 	 ration 	 	,	10	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	,	that	 caus 	 ed 	 	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	is	 conserv 	 ed 	 	.
we	can	see	it	in	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	different	 organism 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 creature 	 s 	 	we	see	it	in	is	a	fish	.
and	we	can	turn	 it 	 s 	 	 heart 	 beat 	 	on	and	off	by	going	in	and	out	of	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	like	you	would	a	light	 s 	 witch 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 shock 	 ing 	 	to	me	,	that	we	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	i	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 produce 	 	the	work	with	the	 ski 	 er 	 	,	that	we	 notice 	 d 	 	that	,	of	course	,	she	had	no	oxygen	consumption	,	and	so	 may 	 be 	 	she	was	in	a	similar	state	of	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	.
but	,	of	course	,	she	was	 al 	 so 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	cold	.
so	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	would	happen	if	we	took	our	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	them	to	the	cold	.
and	so	,	what	we	found	out	was	that	,	if	you	take	 animal 	 s 	 	that	are	 animate 	 d 	 	like	you	and	i	,	and	you	make	them	cold	--	that	is	,	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	garden	 worm 	 s 	 	--	now	they	're	dead	.
but	if	you	have	them	in	 suspend 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	and	move	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	cold	,	they	're	all	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	there	's	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	there	:	if	you	want	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	the	cold	,	you	ought	to	be	 suspend 	 ed 	 	.	right	?
it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	thing	.
and	so	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	,	about	 th 	 is 	 	relationship	between	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 ski 	 er 	 	.
and	so	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	:	might	there	be	some	agent	that	is	in	us	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	make	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	that	we	might	be	able	to	 regulat 	 e 	 	our	own	 metabol 	 ic 	 	 flex 	 ibility 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	 a 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	when	we	got	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	cold	,	and	might	 other 	 wise 	 	pass	away	?
i	thought	it	might	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	sort	of	hunt	for	 s 	 uch 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	know	?
i	should	 ment 	 ion 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	here	that	physiology	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	that	you	can	read	about	will	tell	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kind	of	 here 	 tic 	 al 	 	thing	to	suggest	.
we	have	,	from	the	time	we	are	 s 	 lap 	 ped 	 	on	the	butt	 un 	 til 	 	we	take	our	last	 dy 	 ing 	 	breath	--	that	's	when	we	're	 new 	 born 	 	to	when	we	're	dead	--	we	can	not	 reduc 	 e 	 	our	 metabol 	 ic 	 	rate	 be 	 low 	 	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	standard	,	or	 bas 	 al 	 	 metabol 	 ic 	 	rate	.
but	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 creature 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	 mammal 	 s 	 	,	that	do	 reduc 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 metabol 	 ic 	 	rate	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	ground	 squirrel 	 s 	 	and	 bear 	 s 	 	,	they	 reduc 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 metabol 	 ic 	 	rate	in	the	 winter 	 time 	 	when	they	 hibern 	 ate 	 	.
so	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	:	might	we	be	able	to	find	some	agent	or	trigger	that	might	induce	 s 	 uch 	 	a	state	in	us	?
and	so	,	we	went	looking	for	 s 	 uch 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	period	of	time	when	we	 fail 	 ed 	 	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	.
ken	robinson	is	here	.	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 glor 	 ies 	 	of	failure	.
well	,	we	had	a	lot	of	them	.
we	 tri 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	different	 chemical 	 s 	 	and	 agent 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 fail 	 ed 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	,	one	time	,	i	was	at	home	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	on	the	couch	while	my	wife	was	 put 	 ting 	 	our	child	to	bed	,	and	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	show	.
it	was	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	show	--	it	was	a	nova	show	on	pbs	--	about	 cave 	 s 	 	in	new	mexico	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	cave	was	lechuguilla	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	cave	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	toxic	to	 human 	 s 	 	.
the	 research 	 ers 	 	had	to	suit	up	just	to	enter	it	.
it	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	toxic	gas	,	hydrogen	sulfide	.
now	,	hydrogen	sulfide	is	 cur 	 iously 	 	present	in	us	.
we	make	it	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
the	highest	 concent 	 ration 	 	is	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
yet	,	it	was	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	chemical	 war 	 fare 	 	agent	in	world	war	i	.
it	's	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	toxic	thing	.
in	fact	,	in	chemical	 accident 	 s 	 	,	hydrogen	sulfide	is	known	to	--	if	you	breathe	too	much	of	it	,	you	collapse	to	the	ground	,	you	appear	dead	,	but	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	room	air	,	you	can	be	 re 	 animate 	 d 	 	 with 	 out 	 	harm	,	if	they	do	that	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	i	thought	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	i	have	to	get	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
now	,	it	's	post	-	9/11	america	,	and	when	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	research	institute	,	and	you	say	,	``	hi	.
i	'd	like	to	buy	some	 concent 	 rated 	 	,	 compress 	 ed 	 	gas	 cylinder 	 s 	 	of	a	lethal	gas	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	these	 idea 	 s 	 	,	see	,	about	 want 	 ing 	 	to	suspend	people	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	be	ok	.	``
so	that	's	kind	of	a	tough	day	,	but	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	 re 	 ally 	 	is	some	 bas 	 is 	 	for	 think 	 ing 	 	why	you	might	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	agent	is	in	us	,	and	,	in	fact	,	here	's	a	 cur 	 ious 	 	thing	,	it	 bind 	 s 	 	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	place	 in 	 side 	 	of	your	 cell 	 s 	 	where	oxygen	 bind 	 s 	 	,	and	where	you	burn	it	,	and	that	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	to	live	.
and	so	we	thought	,	like	in	a	game	of	musical	 chair 	 s 	 	,	might	we	be	able	to	give	a	person	some	hydrogen	sulfide	,	and	might	it	be	able	to	occupy	that	place	like	in	a	game	of	musical	 chair 	 s 	 	where	oxygen	might	bind	?
and	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	bind	the	oxygen	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	would	n't	 consum 	 e 	 	it	,	and	then	 may 	 be 	 	it	would	 reduc 	 e 	 	your	demand	for	oxygen	.
i	mean	,	who	 know 	 s 	 	?
so	--	so	,	there	's	the	bit	about	the	dopamine	and	 be 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	,	what	do	you	call	it	,	 delusion 	 al 	 	,	and	you	might	suggest	that	was	it	.
and	so	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	out	might	we	be	able	to	use	hydrogen	sulfide	in	the	presence	of	cold	,	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	we	could	 re 	 produce 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ski 	 er 	 	in	a	mammal	.
now	,	 mammal 	 s 	 	are	warm	-	blooded	 creature 	 s 	 	,	and	when	we	get	cold	,	we	shake	and	we	shiver	,	right	?
we	try	to	keep	our	core	temperature	at	37	 degree 	 s 	 	by	 actual 	 ly 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	more	oxygen	.
so	,	it	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	for	us	when	we	 appli 	 ed 	 	hydrogen	sulfide	to	a	mouse	when	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	cold	 be 	 cause 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	the	core	temperature	of	the	mouse	got	cold	.
it	 stop 	 ped 	 	moving	.
it	 appear 	 ed 	 	dead	.
 it 	 s 	 	oxygen	consumption	rate	fell	by	 ten 	 fold 	 	.
and	here	's	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	point	.
i	told	you	hydrogen	sulfide	is	in	us	.
it	's	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 metabol 	 ized 	 	,	and	all	you	have	to	do	after	six	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	state	of	de	-	 anim 	 ation 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	put	the	thing	out	in	room	air	,	and	it	 warm 	 s 	 	up	,	and	it	's	 non 	 e 	 	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	for	wear	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 cosm 	 ic 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	found	a	way	to	de	-	animate	a	mammal	,	and	it	did	n't	hurt	it	.
now	,	we	'd	found	a	way	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	 it 	 s 	 	oxygen	consumption	to	rock	-	bottom	 level 	 s 	 	,	and	it	was	fine	.
now	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	state	of	de	-	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	it	could	not	go	out	 danc 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	was	not	dead	,	and	it	was	not	 harm 	 ed 	 	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	:	is	 th 	 is 	 	the	agent	that	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	present	in	the	 ski 	 er 	 	,	and	might	have	she	had	more	of	it	than	 some 	 one 	 	else	,	and	might	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	her	demand	for	oxygen	before	she	got	so	cold	that	she	 other 	 wise 	 	would	have	 di 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	found	out	with	our	worm	 experiment 	 s 	 	?
so	,	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	:	can	we	do	 any 	 thing 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	control	 metabol 	 ic 	 	 flex 	 ibility 	 	?
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	--	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	some	of	you	out	there	are	 economist 	 s 	 	,	and	you	know	all	about	supply	and	demand	.
and	when	supply	is	equal	to	demand	,	 every 	 thing 	 	's	fine	,	but	when	supply	 fall 	 s 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	of	oxygen	,	and	demand	 stay 	 s 	 	high	,	you	're	dead	.
so	,	what	i	just	told	you	is	we	can	now	 reduc 	 e 	 	demand	.
we	ought	to	be	able	to	lower	supply	to	unprecedented	low	 level 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	the	animal	.
and	with	money	we	got	from	darpa	,	we	could	show	just	that	.
if	you	give	 mic 	 e 	 	hydrogen	sulfide	,	you	can	lower	 the 	 ir 	 	demand	for	oxygen	,	and	you	can	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	oxygen	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	that	are	 a 	 s 	 	low	 a 	 s 	 	5,000	feet	above	the	top	of	mt	.	everest	,	and	they	can	 s 	 it 	 	there	for	 hour 	 s 	 	,	and	there	's	no	problem	.
well	 th 	 is 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	found	out	that	we	could	subject	 animal 	 s 	 	to	 other 	 wise 	 	lethal	blood	loss	,	and	we	could	 s 	 ave 	 	them	if	we	 g 	 ave 	 	them	hydrogen	sulfide	.
so	these	proof	of	 con 	 cept 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	led	me	to	say	``	i	should	found	a	company	,	and	we	should	take	 th 	 is 	 	out	to	a	 wide 	 r 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	field	.	``
i	 found 	 ed 	 	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	ikaria	with	 other 	 s 	 	'	help	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	company	,	the	first	thing	it	did	was	make	a	liquid	 formula 	 tion 	 	of	hydrogen	sulfide	an	 inject 	 able 	 	form	that	we	could	put	in	and	 s 	 end 	 	it	out	to	physician	 scientist 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	who	work	on	 model 	 s 	 	of	critical	care	medicine	,	and	the	 result 	 s 	 	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	positive	.
in	one	model	of	heart	attack	,	 animal 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	hydrogen	sulfide	 show 	 ed 	 	a	70	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	heart	damage	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	who	got	the	standard	of	care	that	you	and	i	would	 receiv 	 e 	 	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	have	a	heart	attack	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
same	is	true	for	organ	failure	,	when	you	have	loss	of	function	 ow 	 ing 	 	to	poor	 per 	 fusion 	 	of	 kid 	 ney 	 	,	of	liver	,	 a 	 cute 	 	 respirator 	 y 	 	 di 	 stress 	 	syndrome	and	damage	 suffer 	 ed 	 	in	cardiac	-	bypass	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
so	,	these	are	the	thought	 lead 	 ers 	 	in	trauma	medicine	all	over	the	world	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	,	so	it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	hydrogen	sulfide	 de 	 crease 	 s 	 	damage	that	you	 receiv 	 e 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	 other 	 wise 	 	lethal	-	low	oxygen	.
and	i	should	say	that	the	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	of	hydrogen	sulfide	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	benefit	are	low	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	low	.
in	fact	,	so	low	that	 physician 	 s 	 	will	not	have	to	lower	or	 d 	 im 	 	the	 metabol 	 ism 	 	of	people	much	at	all	to	see	the	benefit	i	just	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	which	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	,	if	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 adopt 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	do	n't	want	to	be	 gor 	 king 	 	people	out	just	to	 s 	 ave 	 	them	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 con 	 fusing 	 	.
so	,	i	want	to	say	that	we	're	in	human	 trial 	 s 	 	.
now	,	and	so	--	thank	you	.	the	phase	1	 safe 	 ty 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	are	over	,	and	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	fine	,	we	're	now	 move 	 d 	 	on	.
we	have	to	get	to	phase	2	and	phase	3.	it	's	going	to	take	us	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	all	 move 	 d 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	the	mouse	 experiment 	 s 	 	of	 hibern 	 ating 	 	 mic 	 e 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	2005	;	the	first	human	 stud 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	2008	,	and	we	should	know	in	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	it	 work 	 s 	 	or	not	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	all	 happen 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	lot	of	help	from	a	lot	of	people	.
i	want	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	,	first	of	all	,	my	wife	,	 with 	 out 	 	whom	 th 	 is 	 	talk	and	my	work	would	not	be	possible	,	so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	the	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	work	at	my	lab	and	 al 	 so 	 	 other 	 s 	 	on	staff	,	the	fred	hutchinson	cancer	research	center	in	seattle	,	washington	--	 wonder 	 ful 	 	place	to	work	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 business 	 people 	 	at	ikaria	.
one	thing	 t 	 hose 	 	people	did	out	there	was	take	 th 	 is 	 	technology	of	hydrogen	sulfide	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	start	-	up	company	that	's	 burn 	 ing 	 	venture	capital	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	fused	it	with	 an 	 other 	 	company	that	 sell 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	toxic	gas	that	's	more	toxic	than	hydrogen	sulfide	,	and	they	give	it	to	 new 	 born 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	who	would	 other 	 wise 	 	die	from	a	failure	to	be	able	to	 oxygen 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tissue 	 s 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	gas	that	is	 deliver 	 ed 	 	in	over	a	thousand	critical	care	 hospital 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	,	now	is	approved	,	on	label	,	and	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	a	year	from	certain	death	.
so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	for	me	to	be	a	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	want	to	say	that	i	think	we	're	on	the	path	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	 metabol 	 ic 	 	 flex 	 ibility 	 	in	a	fundamental	way	,	and	that	in	the	not	too	 di 	 stant 	 	future	,	an	emt	might	give	an	 inject 	 ion 	 	of	hydrogen	sulfide	,	or	some	related	 com 	 pound 	 	,	to	a	person	 suffer 	 ing 	 	severe	 inju 	 ries 	 	,	and	that	person	might	de	-	animate	a	bit	,	they	might	 be 	 come 	 	a	little	more	 im 	 mortal 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 metabol 	 ism 	 	will	fall	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	 dimm 	 ing 	 	a	 s 	 witch 	 	on	a	lamp	at	home	.
and	then	,	they	will	have	the	time	,	that	will	buy	them	the	time	,	to	be	 transport 	 ed 	 	to	the	hospital	to	get	the	care	they	need	.
and	then	,	after	they	get	that	care	--	like	the	mouse	,	like	the	 ski 	 er 	 	,	like	the	65	-	year	-	old	woman	--	they	'll	wake	up	.
a	miracle	?
we	hope	not	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	we	just	hope	to	make	 miracle 	 s 	 	a	little	more	common	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
