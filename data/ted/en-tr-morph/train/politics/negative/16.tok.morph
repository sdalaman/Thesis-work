i	'd	like	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	about	the	two	 big 	 gest 	 	social	 trend 	 s 	 	in	the	coming	century	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	in	the	next	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	i	want	to	start	with	my	work	on	romantic	love	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	my	most	 re 	 cent 	 	work	.
what	i	and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	did	was	put	32	people	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 mad 	 ly 	 	in	love	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	functional	mri	brain	scanner	.
17	who	 we 	 re 	 	 mad 	 ly 	 	in	love	and	 the 	 ir 	 	love	was	 accept 	 ed 	 	;	and	15	who	 we 	 re 	 	 mad 	 ly 	 	in	love	and	they	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	 dump 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	i	want	to	tell	you	about	that	first	,	and	then	go	on	 in 	 to 	 	where	i	think	love	is	going	.
``	what	'	tis	to	love	?	``	shakespeare	 s 	 aid 	 	.
i	think	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	--	i	think	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	question	since	they	 s 	 at 	 	around	 the 	 ir 	 	 camp 	 fire 	 s 	 	or	lay	and	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	 star 	 s 	 	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	out	by	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	romantic	love	was	by	looking	at	the	last	45	 year 	 s 	 	of	research	on	--	just	the	 psycho 	 logical 	 	research	--	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	group	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	happen	when	you	fall	in	love	.
the	first	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	is	what	i	call	--	a	person	 begin 	 s 	 	to	take	on	what	i	call	,	``	special	meaning	.	``
 a 	 s 	 	a	truck	driver	once	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	world	had	a	new	center	,	and	that	center	was	mary	anne	.	``
george	bernard	shaw	 s 	 aid 	 	it	a	little	 different 	 ly 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	love	 consist 	 s 	 	of	 over 	 estimating 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	one	woman	and	 an 	 other 	 	.	``
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	that	's	what	we	do	.
and	then	you	just	focus	on	 th 	 is 	 	person	.
you	can	list	what	you	do	n't	like	about	them	,	but	then	you	 s 	 weep 	 	that	 a 	 side 	 	and	focus	on	what	you	do	.
 a 	 s 	 	chaucer	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	love	is	blind	.	``
in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	romantic	love	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	would	read	 poet 	 ry 	 	from	all	over	the	world	,	and	i	just	want	to	give	you	one	 ver 	 y 	 	short	poem	from	eighth	-	century	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	 al 	 most 	 	perfect	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	man	who	is	focused	 total 	 ly 	 	on	a	 part 	 icular 	 	woman	.
it	's	a	little	bit	like	when	you	are	 mad 	 ly 	 	in	love	with	 some 	 body 	 	and	you	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	--	 the 	 ir 	 	car	is	different	from	every	other	car	in	the	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	.
 the 	 ir 	 	wine	glass	at	 d 	 inner 	 	is	different	from	every	other	wine	glass	at	the	 d 	 inner 	 	party	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	man	got	 hook 	 ed 	 	on	a	bamboo	 sleep 	 ing 	 	mat	.
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	it	's	by	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	yuan	chen	:	``	i	can	not	bear	to	put	away	the	bamboo	 sleep 	 ing 	 	mat	.
the	night	i	 br 	 ought 	 	you	home	,	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	you	roll	it	out	.	``
he	 be 	 came 	 	 hook 	 ed 	 	on	a	 sleep 	 ing 	 	mat	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 elev 	 ated 	 	activity	of	dopamine	in	his	brain	,	just	like	with	you	and	me	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	person	take	on	special	meaning	,	you	focus	your	attention	on	them	.
you	aggrandize	them	.	but	you	have	 intens 	 e 	 	energy	.
 a 	 s 	 	one	polynesian	 s 	 aid 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	felt	like	 jump 	 ing 	 	in	the	sky	.	``
you	're	up	all	night	.	you	're	 walk 	 ing 	 	till	dawn	.
you	feel	 intens 	 e 	 	 el 	 ation 	 	when	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	well	;	mood	 s 	 wing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	despair	when	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	 poor 	 ly 	 	.
real	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	person	.
 a 	 s 	 	one	 business 	 man 	 	in	new	york	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 any 	 thing 	 	she	 like 	 d 	 	,	i	 like 	 d 	 	.	``
simple	.	romantic	love	is	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
you	 be 	 come 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 possess 	 ive 	 	.
you	know	,	if	you	're	just	 sleep 	 ing 	 	with	 some 	 body 	 	 casual 	 ly 	 	,	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	care	if	they	're	 sleep 	 ing 	 	with	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
but	the	moment	you	fall	in	love	,	you	 be 	 come 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 possess 	 ive 	 	of	them	.
i	think	that	that	is	a	darwinian	--	there	's	a	darwinian	purpose	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	whole	point	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	pull	two	people	together	 strong 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	begin	to	rear	 bab 	 ies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	team	.
but	the	main	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	romantic	love	are	 crav 	 ing 	 	:	an	 intens 	 e 	 	 crav 	 ing 	 	to	be	with	a	 part 	 icular 	 	person	,	not	just	 sexual 	 ly 	 	,	but	 emotion 	 ally 	 	.
you	'd	much	 ra 	 ther 	 	--	it	would	be	nice	to	go	to	bed	with	them	,	but	you	want	them	to	call	you	on	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	to	 invit 	 e 	 	you	out	,	etc	.	,	to	tell	you	that	they	love	you	.
the	other	main	 character 	 istic 	 	is	 motiv 	 ation 	 	.
the	motor	in	your	brain	 begin 	 s 	 	to	crank	,	and	you	want	 th 	 is 	 	person	.
and	last	but	not	 l 	 east 	 	,	it	is	an	obsession	.
when	i	put	these	people	in	the	machine	,	before	i	put	them	in	the	mri	machine	,	i	would	ask	them	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	.
but	my	most	 import 	 ant 	 	question	was	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	.
it	was	:	``	what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	day	and	night	do	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	person	?	``
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	they	would	say	,	``	all	day	.	all	night	.	i	can	never	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	about	him	or	her	.	``
and	then	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	question	i	would	ask	them	--	i	would	 al 	 ways 	 	have	to	work	 my 	 self 	 	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	not	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	.
i	do	n't	work	with	people	in	any	kind	of	 trauma 	 tic 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
and	my	final	question	was	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	.
i	would	say	,	``	would	you	die	for	him	or	her	?	``
and	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	these	people	would	say	``	 y 	 es 	 	!	``
 a 	 s 	 	if	i	had	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	pass	the	salt	.
i	was	just	 stagger 	 ed 	 	by	it	.
so	we	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	,	looking	at	a	photograph	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 sweet 	 heart 	 	and	looking	at	a	neutral	photograph	,	with	a	 distract 	 ion 	 	task	in	between	.
so	we	could	look	at	the	same	brain	when	it	was	in	that	 height 	 ened 	 	state	and	when	it	was	in	a	 rest 	 ing 	 	state	.
and	we	found	activity	in	a	lot	of	brain	 region 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	was	a	brain	region	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	active	when	you	feel	the	rush	of	 coca 	 ine 	 	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	romantic	love	is	not	an	emotion	.
in	fact	,	i	had	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	it	was	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	from	 ver 	 y 	 	high	to	 ver 	 y 	 	low	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	drive	.	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	motor	of	the	mind	,	the	 want 	 ing 	 	part	of	the	mind	,	the	 crav 	 ing 	 	part	of	the	mind	.
the	kind	of	mind	--	part	of	the	mind	--	when	you	're	 reach 	 ing 	 	for	that	piece	of	chocolate	,	when	you	want	to	win	that	 pro 	 motion 	 	at	work	.
the	motor	of	the	brain	.	it	's	a	drive	.
and	in	fact	,	i	think	it	's	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	the	 s 	 ex 	 	drive	.
you	know	,	if	you	ask	 some 	 body 	 	to	go	to	bed	with	you	,	and	they	say	,	``	no	,	thank	you	,	``	you	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	kill	 your 	 self 	 	or	slip	 in 	 to 	 	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
but	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	around	the	world	,	people	who	are	 reject 	 ed 	 	in	love	will	kill	for	it	.
people	live	for	love	.	they	kill	for	love	.	they	die	for	love	.
they	have	 song 	 s 	 	,	 poem 	 s 	 	,	 novel 	 s 	 	,	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	,	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 myth 	 s 	 	,	 legend 	 s 	 	.
in	over	175	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	people	have	left	 the 	 ir 	 	evidence	of	 th 	 is 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	brain	system	.
i	have	come	to	think	it	's	one	of	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	brain	 system 	 s 	 	on	earth	for	both	great	joy	and	great	sorrow	.
and	i	've	 al 	 so 	 	come	to	think	that	it	's	one	of	three	 bas 	 ically 	 	different	brain	 system 	 s 	 	that	 evolv 	 ed 	 	from	 mat 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 production 	 	.
one	is	the	 s 	 ex 	 	drive	:	the	 crav 	 ing 	 	for	sexual	 grat 	 ification 	 	.
w.h	.	auden	 call 	 ed 	 	it	an	``	 in 	 toler 	 able 	 	neural	itch	,	``	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	that	's	what	it	is	.
it	 keep 	 s 	 	 both 	 er 	 ing 	 	you	a	little	bit	,	like	 be 	 ing 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
the	second	of	these	three	brain	 system 	 s 	 	is	romantic	love	:	that	 el 	 ation 	 	,	obsession	of	early	love	.
and	the	third	brain	system	is	 attach 	 ment 	 	:	that	sense	of	calm	and	security	you	can	feel	for	a	long	-	term	partner	.
and	i	think	that	the	 s 	 ex 	 	drive	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	get	you	out	there	,	looking	for	a	whole	range	of	 partner 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	you	can	feel	it	when	you	're	just	 driv 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	in	your	car	.
it	can	be	focused	on	 no 	 body 	 	.
i	think	romantic	love	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	 en 	 able 	 	you	to	focus	your	 mat 	 ing 	 	energy	on	just	one	individual	at	a	time	,	 there 	 by 	 	 conserv 	 ing 	 	 mat 	 ing 	 	time	and	energy	.
and	i	think	that	 attach 	 ment 	 	,	the	third	brain	system	,	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	 en 	 able 	 	you	to	 toler 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	--	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	raise	a	child	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	team	.
so	with	that	 pre 	 am 	 ble 	 	,	i	want	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 discuss 	 ing 	 	the	two	most	 pro 	 found 	 	social	 trend 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	last	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	and	the	other	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	of	the	last	25	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	are	going	to	have	an	impact	on	these	three	different	brain	 system 	 s 	 	:	lust	,	romantic	love	and	deep	 attach 	 ment 	 	to	a	partner	.
the	first	is	women	 work 	 ing 	 	,	moving	 in 	 to 	 	the	 work 	 force 	 	.
i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	130	 socie 	 ties 	 	through	the	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 year 	 book 	 s 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
and	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	129	out	of	130	of	them	,	women	are	not	 on 	 ly 	 	moving	 in 	 to 	 	the	job	market	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	but	they	are	moving	 in 	 to 	 	the	job	market	--	and	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	that	gap	between	men	and	women	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	economic	power	,	health	and	education	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 	.
for	every	trend	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	there	's	a	counter	-	trend	.
we	all	know	of	them	,	but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	--	the	arabs	say	,	``	the	 dog 	 s 	 	may	bark	,	but	the	 car 	 a 	 van 	 	 move 	 s 	 	on	.	``
and	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	that	 car 	 a 	 van 	 	is	moving	on	.
women	are	moving	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	job	market	.
and	i	say	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	job	market	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	new	.
for	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	on	the	 grass 	 land 	 s 	 	of	africa	,	women	 commute 	 d 	 	to	work	to	gather	 the 	 ir 	 	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	.
they	came	home	with	60	to	80	percent	of	the	 even 	 ing 	 	meal	.
the	double	income	family	was	the	standard	.
and	women	 we 	 re 	 	 regard 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	,	 social 	 ly 	 	and	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	men	.
in	short	,	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	moving	forward	to	the	past	.
then	,	women	's	worst	 invent 	 ion 	 	was	the	plow	.
with	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	plow	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	men	's	 role 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
women	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	ancient	 job 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 collect 	 ors 	 	,	but	then	with	the	industrial	revolution	and	the	post	-	industrial	revolution	they	're	moving	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	job	market	.
in	short	,	they	are	 acquir 	 ing 	 	the	 stat 	 us 	 	that	they	had	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	are	 see 	 ing 	 	now	one	of	the	most	 remark 	 able 	 	 tradition 	 s 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	human	animal	.
and	it	's	going	to	have	an	impact	.
i	 general 	 ly 	 	give	a	whole	 lectur 	 e 	 	on	the	impact	of	women	on	the	business	community	.
i	'll	 on 	 ly 	 	just	say	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	then	go	on	to	 s 	 ex 	 	and	love	.
there	's	a	lot	of	gender	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	;	 any 	 body 	 	who	 think 	 s 	 	men	and	women	are	 a 	 like 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	never	had	a	boy	and	a	girl	child	.
i	do	n't	know	why	it	is	that	they	want	to	think	that	men	and	women	are	 a 	 like 	 	.
there	's	much	we	have	in	common	,	but	there	's	a	whole	lot	that	we	do	not	have	in	common	.
we	are	--	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	ted	hughes	,	``	i	think	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	built	to	be	--	we	're	like	two	feet	.	we	need	each	other	to	get	 a 	 head 	 	.	``
but	we	did	not	evolve	to	have	the	same	brain	.
and	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	and	more	gender	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
i	'll	 on 	 ly 	 	just	use	a	couple	and	then	move	on	to	 s 	 ex 	 	and	love	.
one	of	them	is	women	's	verbal	ability	.	women	can	talk	.
women	's	ability	to	find	the	right	word	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	 bas 	 ic 	 	 articul 	 ation 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	in	the	middle	of	the	 menstru 	 al 	 	cycle	,	when	estrogen	 level 	 s 	 	peak	.
but	even	at	 menstru 	 ation 	 	,	they	're	better	than	the	average	man	.
women	can	talk	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	;	 word 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	women	's	 tool 	 s 	 	.
they	held	that	baby	in	front	of	 the 	 ir 	 	face	,	 ca 	 jol 	 ing 	 	it	,	 reprimand 	 ing 	 	it	,	 educ 	 ating 	 	it	with	 word 	 s 	 	.
and	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	they	're	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	force	.
even	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	india	and	japan	,	where	women	are	not	moving	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	regular	job	market	,	they	're	moving	 in 	 to 	 	 journal 	 ism 	 	.
and	i	think	that	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	is	like	the	global	 camp 	 fire 	 	.
we	 s 	 it 	 	around	it	and	it	 shape 	 s 	 	our	 mind 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	,	when	i	'm	on	tv	,	the	 produce 	 rs 	 	who	call	me	,	who	 negoti 	 ate 	 	what	we	're	going	to	say	,	is	a	woman	.
in	fact	,	solzhenitsyn	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	to	have	a	great	writer	is	to	have	 an 	 other 	 	government	.	``
 to 	 day 	 	54	percent	of	people	who	are	 writer 	 s 	 	in	america	are	women	.
it	's	one	of	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	that	women	have	that	they	will	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	job	market	.
they	've	got	 in 	 credible 	 	people	 skill 	 s 	 	,	 negoti 	 ating 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	 imagin 	 ative 	 	.
we	now	know	the	brain	 circuit 	 ry 	 	of	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	of	long	-	term	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
they	tend	to	be	web	 think 	 ers 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	female	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	are	better	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	they	tend	to	collect	more	 piece 	 s 	 	of	data	when	they	think	,	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	more	complex	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	see	more	 option 	 s 	 	and	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
they	tend	to	be	contextual	,	 hol 	 istic 	 	 think 	 ers 	 	,	what	i	call	web	 think 	 ers 	 	.
men	tend	to	--	and	these	are	 average 	 s 	 	--	tend	to	get	rid	of	what	they	regard	 a 	 s 	 	 extra 	 ne 	 ous 	 	,	focus	on	what	they	do	,	and	move	in	a	more	step	-	by	-	step	 think 	 ing 	 	pattern	.
they	're	both	 perfect 	 ly 	 	good	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
we	need	both	of	them	to	get	 a 	 head 	 	.
in	fact	,	there	's	 man 	 y 	 	more	male	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	in	the	world	.
when	the	--	and	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	 man 	 y 	 	more	male	 idiot 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
when	the	male	brain	 work 	 s 	 	well	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	.
and	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	we	're	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	which	the	 talent 	 s 	 	of	both	men	and	women	are	 be 	 coming 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	and	 valu 	 ed 	 	and	 employ 	 ed 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	women	moving	 in 	 to 	 	the	job	market	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	huge	impact	on	 s 	 ex 	 	and	 rom 	 ance 	 	and	family	life	.
 fore 	 most 	 	,	women	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	express	 the 	 ir 	 	 sexual 	 ity 	 	.
i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 astonish 	 ed 	 	when	people	come	to	me	and	say	,	``	why	is	it	that	men	are	so	 adult 	 er 	 ous 	 	?	``
and	i	say	,	``	why	do	you	think	more	men	are	 adult 	 er 	 ous 	 	than	women	?	``
``	oh	,	well	--	men	are	more	 adult 	 er 	 ous 	 	!	``
and	i	say	,	``	who	do	you	think	these	men	are	 sleep 	 ing 	 	with	?	``
and	--	 bas 	 ic 	 	math	!
 any 	 way 	 	.
in	the	western	world	,	women	start	 soon 	 er 	 	at	 s 	 ex 	 	,	have	more	 partner 	 s 	 	,	express	less	remorse	for	the	 partner 	 s 	 	that	they	do	,	marry	 lat 	 er 	 	,	have	 few 	 er 	 	children	,	 leav 	 e 	 	bad	 marriage 	 s 	 	in	order	to	get	good	 one 	 s 	 	.
we	are	 see 	 ing 	 	the	rise	of	female	sexual	 express 	 ion 	 	.
and	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	we	're	moving	forward	to	the	kind	of	sexual	 express 	 ion 	 	that	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	saw	on	the	 grass 	 land 	 s 	 	of	africa	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	sexual	 express 	 ion 	 	that	we	see	in	 hunt 	 ing 	 	and	 gather 	 ing 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 return 	 ing 	 	to	an	ancient	form	of	marriage	 e 	 quality 	 	.
they	're	now	 say 	 ing 	 	that	the	21st	century	is	going	to	be	the	century	of	what	they	call	the	``	 symmetric 	 al 	 	marriage	,	``	or	the	``	 pur 	 e 	 	marriage	,	``	or	the	``	 companion 	 ate 	 	marriage	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	marriage	between	 equal 	 s 	 	,	moving	forward	to	a	pattern	that	is	 high 	 ly 	 	compatible	with	the	ancient	human	spirit	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	a	rise	of	romantic	love	.
91	percent	of	american	women	and	86	percent	of	american	men	would	not	marry	 some 	 body 	 	who	had	every	single	quality	they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	in	a	partner	,	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	in	love	with	that	person	.
people	around	the	world	,	in	a	 stud 	 y 	 	of	37	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	want	to	be	in	love	with	the	person	that	they	marry	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 arrange 	 d 	 	 marriage 	 s 	 	are	on	 the 	 ir 	 	way	off	 th 	 is 	 	braid	of	human	life	.
i	even	think	that	 marriage 	 s 	 	might	even	 be 	 come 	 	more	 s 	 table 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	second	great	world	trend	.
the	first	one	 be 	 ing 	 	women	moving	 in 	 to 	 	the	job	market	,	the	second	one	 be 	 ing 	 	the	aging	world	population	.
they	're	now	 say 	 ing 	 	that	in	america	,	that	middle	age	should	be	 regard 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	up	to	age	85	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	that	highest	age	 categor 	 y 	 	of	76	to	85	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	40	percent	of	people	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	wrong	with	them	.
so	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	there	's	a	real	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	middle	age	.
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	--	for	one	of	my	 book 	 s 	 	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	divorce	data	in	58	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	the	 old 	 er 	 	you	get	,	the	less	 like 	 ly 	 	you	are	to	divorce	.
so	the	divorce	rate	right	now	is	 s 	 table 	 	in	america	,	and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	decline	.
it	may	decline	some	more	.
i	would	even	say	that	with	viagra	,	estrogen	 re 	 placement 	 	,	hip	 replace 	 ments 	 	and	the	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	women	--	women	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	now	.
not	at	any	time	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	have	women	 be 	 en 	 	so	educated	,	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	so	 cap 	 able 	 	.
and	so	i	 honest 	 ly 	 	think	that	if	there	 re 	 ally 	 	was	ever	a	time	in	human	evolution	when	we	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	good	 marriage 	 s 	 	,	that	time	is	now	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 complic 	 ations 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	these	three	brain	 system 	 s 	 	:	lust	,	romantic	love	and	 attach 	 ment 	 	--	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	go	together	.
they	can	go	together	,	by	the	way	.
that	's	why	casual	 s 	 ex 	 	is	n't	so	casual	.
with	orgasm	you	get	a	spike	of	dopamine	.
dopamine	's	 associate 	 d 	 	with	romantic	love	,	and	you	can	just	fall	in	love	with	 some 	 body 	 	who	you	're	just	 hav 	 ing 	 	casual	 s 	 ex 	 	with	.
with	orgasm	,	then	you	get	a	real	rush	of	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	and	vasopressin	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 attach 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	you	can	feel	 s 	 uch 	 	a	sense	of	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 un 	 ion 	 	with	 some 	 body 	 	after	you	've	made	love	to	them	.
but	these	three	brain	 system 	 s 	 	:	lust	,	romantic	love	and	 attach 	 ment 	 	,	are	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	each	other	.
you	can	feel	deep	 attach 	 ment 	 	to	a	long	-	term	partner	while	you	feel	 intens 	 e 	 	romantic	love	for	 some 	 body 	 	else	,	while	you	feel	the	 s 	 ex 	 	drive	for	people	 un 	 related 	 	to	these	other	 partner 	 s 	 	.
in	short	,	we	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	loving	more	than	one	person	at	a	time	.
in	fact	,	you	can	lie	in	bed	at	night	and	 s 	 wing 	 	from	deep	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 attach 	 ment 	 	for	one	person	to	deep	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	romantic	love	for	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	there	's	a	 commit 	 tee 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	going	on	in	your	head	 a 	 s 	 	you	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	what	to	do	.
so	i	do	n't	think	,	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	an	animal	that	was	built	to	be	happy	;	we	are	an	animal	that	was	built	to	 re 	 produce 	 	.
i	think	the	happiness	we	find	,	we	make	.
and	i	think	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	we	can	make	good	 relationship 	 s 	 	with	each	other	.
so	i	want	to	conclude	with	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	conclude	with	a	worry	--	i	have	a	worry	--	and	with	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	story	.
the	worry	is	about	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	.
over	100	million	 prescription 	 s 	 	of	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	are	written	every	year	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 drug 	 s 	 	are	going	generic	.
they	are	 seep 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	.
i	know	one	girl	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	on	these	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	,	serotonin	-	enhancing	--	ssri	,	serotonin	-	enhancing	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	--	since	she	was	13	.
she	's	23.	she	's	 be 	 en 	 	on	them	ever	since	she	was	13	.
i	've	got	 noth 	 ing 	 	against	people	who	take	them	short	term	,	when	they	're	going	through	 some 	 thing 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	.
they	want	to	commit	 su 	 icide 	 	or	kill	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
i	would	recommend	it	.
but	more	and	more	people	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	are	taking	them	long	term	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	what	these	 drug 	 s 	 	do	is	raise	 level 	 s 	 	of	serotonin	.
and	by	raising	 level 	 s 	 	of	serotonin	,	you	suppress	the	dopamine	circuit	.
 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	.
dopamine	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	romantic	love	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	they	suppress	the	dopamine	circuit	,	but	they	kill	the	 s 	 ex 	 	drive	.
and	when	you	kill	the	 s 	 ex 	 	drive	,	you	kill	orgasm	.
and	when	you	kill	orgasm	,	you	kill	that	flood	of	 drug 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 attach 	 ment 	 	.
the	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	in	the	brain	.
and	when	you	tamper	with	one	brain	system	,	you	're	going	to	tamper	with	 an 	 other 	 	.
i	'm	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	a	world	 with 	 out 	 	love	is	a	 dead 	 ly 	 	place	.
so	now	--	--	thank	you	.
i	want	to	end	with	a	story	.	and	then	,	just	a	comment	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	romantic	love	and	 s 	 ex 	 	and	 attach 	 ment 	 	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	an	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 	;	i	am	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	why	we	're	all	 a 	 like 	 	.
why	you	and	i	are	 a 	 like 	 	,	why	the	iraqis	and	the	japanese	and	the	australian	aborigines	and	the	people	of	the	amazon	river	are	all	 a 	 like 	 	.
and	about	a	year	ago	,	an	 inter 	 net 	 	 d 	 ating 	 	service	,	match.com	,	came	to	me	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	i	would	design	a	new	 d 	 ating 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	for	them	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	 personal 	 ity 	 	.	you	know	?
i	do	n't	know	.	do	you	think	you	've	got	the	right	person	?	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
it	got	me	 think 	 ing 	 	about	why	it	is	that	you	fall	in	love	with	one	person	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	.
that	's	my	current	project	;	it	will	be	my	next	book	.
there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	that	you	fall	in	love	with	one	person	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	.
 tim 	 ing 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.	 proxim 	 ity 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 myster 	 y 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.	you	fall	in	love	with	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	 some 	 what 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	,	in	part	 be 	 cause 	 	 myster 	 y 	 	 elev 	 ates 	 	dopamine	in	the	brain	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 push 	 es 	 	you	over	that	threshold	to	fall	in	love	.
you	fall	in	love	with	 some 	 body 	 	who	 fit 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	what	i	call	your	``	love	map	,	``	an	 un 	 conscious 	 	list	of	 trait 	 s 	 	that	you	build	in	 child 	 hood 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	grow	up	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	think	that	you	 gravit 	 ate 	 	to	certain	people	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	with	 some 	 what 	 	 comple 	 ment 	 ary 	 	brain	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	i	'm	now	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	i	want	to	tell	you	a	story	about	--	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	on	here	about	the	biology	of	love	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	a	little	bit	about	the	culture	of	it	,	too	--	the	magic	of	it	.
it	's	a	story	that	was	told	to	me	by	 some 	 body 	 	who	had	heard	it	just	from	one	of	the	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	true	story	.
it	was	a	graduate	student	at	--	i	'm	at	rutgers	and	my	two	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	--	art	aron	is	at	suny	stony	brook	.
that	's	where	we	put	our	people	in	the	mri	machine	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	graduate	student	was	 mad 	 ly 	 	in	love	with	 an 	 other 	 	graduate	student	,	and	she	was	not	in	love	with	him	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	in	beijing	.
and	he	 k 	 new 	 	from	our	work	that	if	you	go	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	novel	with	 some 	 body 	 	,	you	can	drive	up	the	dopamine	in	the	brain	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	trigger	 th 	 is 	 	brain	system	for	romantic	love	.
so	he	 decide 	 d 	 	he	'd	put	science	to	work	,	and	he	 invit 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	girl	to	go	off	on	a	rickshaw	ride	with	him	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	--	i	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	in	one	,	but	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	they	go	all	around	the	 bus 	 es 	 	and	the	 truck 	 s 	 	and	it	's	crazy	and	it	's	noisy	and	it	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
and	he	 figur 	 ed 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	would	drive	up	the	dopamine	,	and	she	would	fall	in	love	with	him	.
so	off	they	go	and	she	's	 squeal 	 ing 	 	and	 squeez 	 ing 	 	him	and	 laugh 	 ing 	 	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	time	.
an	hour	 lat 	 er 	 	they	get	down	off	of	the	rickshaw	,	and	she	 throw 	 s 	 	her	 hand 	 s 	 	up	and	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	was	n't	that	 wonder 	 ful 	 	?	``
and	,	``	was	n't	that	rickshaw	driver	 hand 	 some 	 	!	``
there	's	magic	to	love	!
but	i	will	end	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	three	 bas 	 ic 	 	 drive 	 s 	 	:	the	 s 	 ex 	 	drive	,	romantic	love	and	 attach 	 ment 	 	to	a	long	-	term	partner	.
these	 circuit 	 s 	 	are	 deep 	 ly 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	the	human	brain	.
they	're	going	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	our	species	 surviv 	 es 	 	on	what	shakespeare	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 th 	 is 	 	mortal	coil	.	``
