i	am	known	best	for	human	-	powered	flight	,	but	that	was	just	one	thing	that	got	me	going	in	the	sort	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	in	now	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	 young 	 ster 	 	,	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	model	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	,	 ornithopter 	 s 	 	,	 auto 	 gyros 	 	,	 helicopter 	 s 	 	,	 glider 	 s 	 	,	power	 plane 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 door 	 	 model 	 s 	 	,	 out 	 door 	 	 model 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	,	which	i	just	thought	was	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	 wonder 	 ed 	 	why	most	other	people	did	n't	share	my	same	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	with	them	.
and	then	,	 nav 	 y 	 	pilot	training	,	and	,	after	college	,	i	got	 in 	 to 	 	 sail 	 plane 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	,	power	plane	 fly 	 ing 	 	,	and	 consider 	 ed 	 	the	 sail 	 plane 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	hobby	and	 f 	 un 	 	,	but	got	 tangle 	 d 	 	up	with	some	great	professor	 type 	 s 	 	,	who	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	me	and	 every 	 body 	 	else	in	the	field	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	good	way	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	deep	science	.
while	 th 	 is 	 	was	all	going	on	,	i	was	in	the	field	of	weather	 mod 	 ification 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	a	ph.d.	in	 aeronautic 	 s 	 	.
the	weather	 mod 	 ification 	 	subject	was	 get 	 ting 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	graduate	student	,	i	could	go	around	to	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 give 	 n 	 	,	on	a	hitchhiker	ride	to	the	east	coast	,	and	so	on	.	and	 every 	 body 	 	would	talk	to	me	,	but	all	the	 professional 	 s 	 	in	the	field	 hat 	 ed 	 	each	other	,	and	they	would	n't	communicate	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	i	got	the	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	in	that	field	,	and	 start 	 ed 	 	a	company	,	which	did	more	research	in	weather	 mod 	 ification 	 	than	 any 	 body 	 	,	and	there	are	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	just	ca	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	.
but	then	,	1971	 start 	 ed 	 	aerovironment	,	with	no	 employ 	 ees 	 	--	then	one	or	two	,	three	,	and	sort	of	 fum 	 bled 	 	 a 	 long 	 	on	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 interest 	 ing 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
we	had	airdynamisis	,	who	,	like	i	,	did	not	want	to	work	for	 aero 	 space 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	on	some	big	,	 man 	 y 	 	year	project	,	and	so	we	did	our	small	 project 	 s 	 	,	and	the	company	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	grew	.
the	thing	that	is	 excit 	 ing 	 	was	,	in	1976	,	i	 sudden 	 ly 	 	got	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	human	-	powered	 air 	 plane 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'd	made	a	made	a	loan	to	a	friend	of	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	or	i	 guarantee 	 d 	 	the	money	at	the	bank	.
he	 need 	 ed 	 	them	--	he	 need 	 ed 	 	the	money	for	 start 	 ing 	 	a	company	.
the	company	did	not	succeed	,	and	he	could	n't	pay	the	money	back	,	and	i	was	the	 guar 	 ant 	 or 	 	of	the	note	.	so	,	i	had	a	$	100,000	debt	,	and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	the	kramer	prize	for	human	-	powered	flight	,	which	had	then	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	--	--	17	 year 	 s 	 	at	the	time	,	was	50,000	 pound 	 s 	 	,	which	,	at	the	 ex 	 change 	 	rate	,	was	just	about	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	human	-	powered	flight	--	--	and	did	not	--	the	way	i	 approach 	 ed 	 	it	,	first	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	ways	to	make	the	 plane 	 s 	 	,	was	just	like	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	england	,	and	not	 succeed 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	it	up	.	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	,	 na 	 h 	 	,	there	is	n't	any	simple	,	easy	way	.
but	then	,	got	off	on	a	 vac 	 ation 	 	trip	,	and	was	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	bird	flight	,	just	for	the	 f 	 un 	 	of	it	,	and	you	can	watch	a	bird	 soar 	 ing 	 	around	in	 circle 	 s 	 	,	and	measure	the	time	,	and	estimate	the	bank	angle	,	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	figure	out	 it 	 s 	 	speed	,	and	the	 turn 	 ing 	 	 radi 	 us 	 	,	and	so	on	,	which	i	could	do	in	the	car	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 driv 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	on	a	 vac 	 ation 	 	trip	--	--	with	my	three	 son 	 s 	 	,	young	 son 	 s 	 	,	 help 	 ing 	 	me	,	but	 ridicul 	 ing 	 	the	whole	thing	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
but	that	 beg 	 an 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	 bird 	 s 	 	went	around	,	and	then	how	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	would	,	how	hang	 glider 	 s 	 	would	fly	,	and	then	other	 plane 	 s 	 	,	and	the	idea	of	the	gossamer	-	condor	-	type	 air 	 plane 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	,	was	so	logical	,	one	should	have	thought	of	it	in	the	first	place	,	but	one	did	n't	.	and	it	was	just	,	keep	the	weight	down	--	70	 pound 	 s 	 	was	all	it	 weigh 	 ed 	 	--	but	let	the	 s 	 ize 	 	 s 	 well 	 	up	,	like	a	hang	glider	,	but	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	span	,	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	cord	.
you	're	down	to	a	third	of	the	speed	,	a	third	of	the	power	,	and	a	good	 bi 	 cyclist 	 	can	put	out	that	power	,	and	that	 work 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	won	the	prize	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	.
we	did	n't	--	a	lot	of	 fly 	 ing 	 	,	a	lot	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	did	n't	work	,	and	 one 	 s 	 	that	did	work	,	and	the	plane	 ke 	 pt 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	better	,	a	little	better	.
got	a	good	pilot	,	brian	allen	,	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	it	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	about	65,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	was	 s 	 pent 	 	on	the	project	.
and	there	was	 on 	 ly 	 	about	30	to	help	retire	the	debt	.
but	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	henry	kramer	,	who	put	up	the	prize	for	--	that	was	a	one	-	mile	flight	--	put	up	a	new	prize	for	 fly 	 ing 	 	the	english	channel	,	21	 mile 	 s 	 	.
and	he	thought	it	would	take	 an 	 other 	 	18	 year 	 s 	 	for	 some 	 body 	 	to	win	that	.
we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	if	you	just	 clean 	 ed 	 	up	our	gossamer	condor	a	little	bit	,	the	power	to	fly	would	be	 de 	 crease 	 d 	 	a	little	bit	,	and	if	you	 de 	 crease 	 	the	power	 requir 	 ed 	 	a	little	,	the	pilot	can	fly	a	much	 long 	 er 	 	period	of	time	.
and	brian	allen	was	able	,	in	a	 miracul 	 ous 	 	flight	,	to	get	the	gossamer	 al 	 batross 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	english	channel	,	and	we	won	the	100,000	-	pound	,	200,000	-	dollar	prize	for	that	.
and	when	all	 expense 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	paid	,	the	debt	was	 handle 	 d 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	was	fine	.
it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	giving	the	 plane 	 s 	 	to	the	museum	was	worth	much	more	than	the	debt	,	so	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	six	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 on 	 ly 	 	had	to	pay	one	third	income	tax	.
so	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	good	economic	 reason 	 s 	 	for	the	project	,	but	--	--	that	's	not	,	well	,	the	project	was	 d 	 one 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	for	economic	 reason 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	any	human	-	powered	flight	since	then	--	--	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 prize 	 s 	 	are	all	over	.
but	that	 s 	 ure 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	me	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 vari 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	making	a	solar	-	powered	plane	 be 	 cause 	 	we	felt	solar	power	was	going	to	be	so	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	country	and	the	world	,	we	did	n't	want	the	small	 fund 	 ing 	 	in	the	government	to	be	 de 	 crease 	 d 	 	,	which	is	what	the	government	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	it	.
and	we	thought	a	solar	-	powered	plane	would	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	make	sense	,	but	you	could	do	it	and	it	would	get	a	lot	of	 public 	 ity 	 	for	solar	power	and	 may 	 be 	 	help	that	field	.
and	that	project	 continu 	 ed 	 	,	did	succeed	,	and	we	then	got	 in 	 to 	 	other	 project 	 s 	 	in	 av 	 iation 	 	and	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	ground	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
but	while	 th 	 is 	 	was	going	on	,	in	1982	,	i	got	a	prize	from	the	lindbergh	 found 	 ation 	 	--	 the 	 ir 	 	annual	prize	--	and	i	had	to	 prep 	 are 	 	a	paper	on	it	,	which	 collect 	 ed 	 	all	my	 vari 	 ed 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	and	 vari 	 ed 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	one	chance	that	i	had	to	focus	on	what	i	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	was	after	,	and	what	was	 import 	 ant 	 	.	and	to	my	surprise	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	which	charles	lindbergh	 devote 	 d 	 	the	last	third	of	his	life	to	,	and	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	that	paper	did	me	a	lot	of	good	.
i	thought	back	about	if	i	was	a	space	 travel 	 er 	 	,	and	came	and	 visit 	 ed 	 	earth	every	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	for	a	few	thousand	 visit 	 s 	 	,	i	would	see	the	same	thing	every	time	,	the	little	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	the	earth	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	last	time	,	just	coming	round	,	right	now	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	there	'd	be	huge	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	environment	,	in	the	 concent 	 ration 	 	of	people	,	and	it	was	just	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	,	the	amount	of	--	all	the	change	in	it	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	--	well	,	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 change 	 s 	 	is	,	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	using	coal	from	 under 	 ground 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	and	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 beg 	 an 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	from	 under 	 ground 	 	,	with	a	lot	of	 poll 	 ution 	 	.	and	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	consumption	,	or	production	,	will	reach	 it 	 s 	 	limit	in	about	ten	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	then	go	down	,	and	we	wonder	what	's	going	to	happen	with	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	the	slide	--	 th 	 is 	 	slide	,	i	think	,	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	one	any	of	you	will	see	,	ever	,	 be 	 cause 	 	--	--	it	 show 	 s 	 	nature	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	and	 go 	 es 	 	from	1850	to	2050	.
and	so	,	the	year	2000	,	you	see	there	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	weight	of	all	air	and	land	 vertebrate 	 s 	 	.
 human 	 s 	 	and	 mus 	 k 	 rat 	 s 	 	and	 giraffe 	 s 	 	and	 bird 	 s 	 	and	so	on	,	are	--	the	red	line	 go 	 es 	 	up	.	that	's	the	 human 	 s 	 	and	 live 	 stock 	 	and	 pet 	 s 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	.
the	green	line	 go 	 es 	 	down	.	that	's	the	wild	nature	 port 	 ion 	 	.
 human 	 s 	 	,	 live 	 stock 	 	and	 pet 	 s 	 	are	,	now	,	98	percent	of	the	total	world	's	mass	of	 vertebrate 	 s 	 	on	land	and	air	.
and	you	do	n't	know	what	the	future	will	hold	,	but	it	's	not	going	to	get	a	lower	 percent 	 age 	 	.
ten	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	 human 	 s 	 	and	 live 	 stock 	 	and	 pet 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	even	one	tenth	of	one	percent	and	would	n't	even	have	 be 	 en 	 	visible	on	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 curv 	 e 	 	.
now	they	are	98	percent	,	and	it	,	i	think	,	 show 	 s 	 	human	 domin 	 ation 	 	of	the	earth	.
i	give	a	talk	to	some	 remark 	 able 	 	high	school	 student 	 s 	 	each	summer	,	and	ask	them	,	after	they	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	i	give	them	a	talk	and	so	on	.	then	i	ask	them	 question 	 s 	 	.
what	's	the	population	of	the	earth	?
what	's	the	population	of	the	earth	going	to	be	when	you	're	the	age	of	your	 parent 	 s 	 	?
which	i	'd	never	,	 re 	 ally 	 	--	they	had	never	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	thought	about	but	,	now	,	they	think	about	it	.
and	then	,	what	population	of	the	earth	would	be	an	equilibrium	that	could	 continu 	 e 	 	on	,	and	be	for	2050	,	2100	,	2150	?
and	they	form	little	 group 	 s 	 	,	all	 fight 	 ing 	 	with	each	other	,	and	when	i	 leav 	 e 	 	,	two	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	most	of	them	are	 say 	 ing 	 	about	2	billion	people	,	and	they	do	n't	have	any	clue	about	how	to	get	down	to	2	billion	,	nor	do	i	,	but	i	think	they	're	right	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	serious	problem	.
rachel	carson	was	 think 	 ing 	 	of	these	,	and	came	out	with	``	silent	spring	,	``	way	back	.
``	solar	 manifest 	 o 	 	``	by	hermann	scheer	,	in	germany	,	 claim 	 s 	 	all	energy	on	earth	can	be	derived	,	for	every	country	,	from	solar	energy	and	water	,	and	so	on	.
you	do	n't	need	to	dig	down	for	these	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	do	 thing 	 s 	 	much	more	 efficient 	 ly 	 	.
let	's	have	the	next	slide	.

pm	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	and	let	's	have	the	next	.
that	plane	is	 wide 	 ly 	 	used	by	the	 militar 	 y 	 	,	now	,	in	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	.
let	's	have	the	next	video	.
alan	alda	:	he	's	got	it	,	he	's	got	it	,	he	's	got	it	on	his	head	.
we	're	going	to	end	our	visit	with	paul	maccready	's	 fly 	 ing 	 	circus	by	 meet 	 ing 	 	his	son	,	tyler	,	who	,	with	his	two	 brother 	 s 	 	,	 help 	 ed 	 	build	the	gossamer	condor	,	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
tyler	maccready	:	you	can	chase	it	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	for	 hour 	 s 	 	.
aa	:	when	they	got	 bor 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	father	's	project	,	they	 invent 	 ed 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	little	plane	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
tm	:	and	i	can	control	it	by	 put 	 ting 	 	the	lift	on	one	side	of	the	wing	,	or	on	the	other	.
aa	:	they	 call 	 ed 	 	it	 the 	 ir 	 	walkalong	glider	.
i	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
how	old	 we 	 re 	 	you	when	you	 invent 	 ed 	 	that	?
tm	:	oh	,	10	,	11	.
tm	:	12	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
pm	:	and	tyler	's	here	to	show	you	the	walkalong	.
tm	:	all	right	.	you	all	got	a	couple	of	these	in	your	gift	 bag 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	production	version	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	 d 	 ive 	 	a	little	bit	,	and	so	i	would	just	suggest	you	bend	the	wing	 tip 	 s 	 	up	a	little	bit	before	you	try	 fly 	 ing 	 	it	.
i	'll	give	you	a	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
the	idea	is	that	it	 soar 	 s 	 	on	the	lift	over	your	body	,	like	a	 sea 	 gull 	 	 soar 	 ing 	 	on	a	cliff	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	wind	 come 	 s 	 	up	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	go	over	the	cliff	,	so	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	through	the	air	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	around	your	body	,	some	 ha 	 s 	 	to	go	over	you	.
and	so	you	just	keep	the	glider	 position 	 ed 	 	in	that	up	current	.
the	launch	is	the	difficult	part	:	you	've	got	to	hold	it	high	up	,	over	your	head	,	and	you	start	 walk 	 ing 	 	forward	,	and	just	let	go	of	it	,	and	you	can	control	it	like	that	.
and	then	 al 	 so 	 	,	like	it	 s 	 aid 	 	in	the	video	,	you	can	turn	it	left	or	right	just	by	 put 	 ting 	 	the	lift	under	one	wing	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	i	can	do	it	--	 oop 	 s 	 	,	that	was	going	to	be	a	right	turn	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	will	be	a	left	turn	.
here	,	but	--	--	 any 	 way 	 	.
and	that	's	it	,	so	you	can	just	control	it	,	 where 	 ver 	 	you	want	,	and	it	's	just	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 f 	 un 	 	.	and	these	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	in	production	,	so	you	have	real	 collect 	 or 	 	's	 item 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	--	if	we	can	get	the	video	running	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	--	just	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	little	video	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	in	the	party	last	night	,	and	--	--	you	can	see	how	it	just	can	fly	around	,	and	you	can	 s 	 py 	 	on	 any 	 body 	 	you	want	.
and	that	's	it	.	i	was	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	an	 air 	 plane 	 	,	but	i	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	hitting	people	in	here	,	so	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	little	bit	more	gentle	.
and	that	's	it	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	just	a	few	 invent 	 ions 	 	.
all	right	.
