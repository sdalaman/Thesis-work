we	are	now	going	through	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	and	unprecedented	moment	where	the	power	 dynamic 	 s 	 	between	men	and	women	are	shifting	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	it	 count 	 s 	 	the	most	,	women	are	,	in	fact	,	taking	control	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.
in	my	mother	's	day	,	she	did	n't	go	to	college	.
not	a	lot	of	women	did	.
and	now	,	for	every	two	men	who	get	a	college	degree	,	three	women	will	do	the	same	.
women	,	for	the	first	time	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	 be 	 came 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	american	 work 	 force 	 	.
and	they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	dominate	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 profession 	 s 	 	--	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	 bank 	 ers 	 	,	 account 	 ants 	 	.
over	50	percent	of	 manage 	 rs 	 	are	women	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	15	 profession 	 s 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	to	grow	the	most	in	the	next	decade	,	all	but	two	of	them	are	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	women	.
so	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 be 	 coming 	 	a	place	where	women	are	more	 success 	 ful 	 	than	men	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	and	these	economic	 change 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 rapid 	 ly 	 	affect	our	culture	--	what	our	romantic	 come 	 dies 	 	look	like	,	what	our	 marriage 	 s 	 	look	like	,	what	our	 d 	 ating 	 	 live 	 s 	 	look	like	,	and	our	new	set	of	 super 	 heroes 	 	.
for	a	long	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	image	of	american	 man 	 hood 	 	that	 dominate 	 d 	 	--	tough	,	 rug 	 ged 	 	,	in	control	of	his	own	environment	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	marlboro	man	was	 retire 	 d 	 	and	 replace 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	much	less	 impress 	 ive 	 	specimen	,	who	is	a	 paro 	 dy 	 	of	american	 man 	 hood 	 	,	and	that	's	what	we	have	in	our	 commercial 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	phrase	``	first	-	born	son	``	is	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	 ing 	 rain 	 ed 	 	in	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	statistic	 al 	 one 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	me	.
in	american	 fertil 	 ity 	 	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	75	percent	of	 couple 	 s 	 	are	 request 	 ing 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	and	not	 boy 	 s 	 	.
and	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	would	n't	think	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	south	korea	,	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	strict	 patriarch 	 al 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	break	down	a	little	,	and	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	 prefer 	 ring 	 	first	-	born	 son 	 s 	 	.
if	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	you	just	open	your	 eye 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	and	start	to	connect	the	 dot 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	the	evidence	 every 	 where 	 	.
you	can	see	it	in	college	 gradu 	 ation 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	in	job	 project 	 ions 	 	,	in	our	marriage	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	it	in	the	icelandic	 election 	 s 	 	,	which	you	'll	hear	about	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	you	can	see	it	on	south	korean	 survey 	 s 	 	on	son	 pre 	 ference 	 	,	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	and	unprecedented	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	women	.
 certain 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	first	time	that	we	've	had	great	progress	with	women	.
the	'20s	and	the	'60s	 al 	 so 	 	come	to	mind	.
but	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	that	,	back	then	,	it	was	driven	by	a	 ver 	 y 	 	passionate	feminist	 move 	 ment 	 	that	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	project	 it 	 s 	 	own	 desir 	 es 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	it	's	not	about	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	and	it	's	not	about	any	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	just	about	the	 fact 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	economic	moment	that	we	live	in	.
the	200,000	-	year	period	in	which	men	have	 be 	 en 	 	top	dog	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	coming	to	an	end	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	and	that	's	why	i	talk	about	the	``	end	of	men	.	``
now	all	you	men	out	there	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	moment	where	you	tune	out	or	throw	some	 tomato 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	point	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	all	of	us	.
i	 my 	 self 	 	have	a	husband	and	a	father	and	two	 son 	 s 	 	whom	i	 d 	 early 	 	love	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	i	like	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	do	n't	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	it	,	then	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	will	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
but	if	we	do	take	account	of	it	,	then	i	think	it	will	go	much	more	 smooth 	 ly 	 	.
i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	.
i	was	 read 	 ing 	 	 head 	 lines 	 	about	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	just	like	 any 	 one 	 	else	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	notice	a	distinct	pattern	--	that	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	was	 affect 	 ing 	 	men	much	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	than	it	was	 affect 	 ing 	 	women	.
and	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	back	to	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	i	read	a	book	by	susan	faludi	 call 	 ed 	 	``	stiffed	:	the	 betray 	 al 	 	of	the	american	man	,	``	in	which	she	 de 	 scribed 	 	how	hard	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	had	hit	men	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	 whet 	 her 	 	it	had	gotten	 wo 	 rse 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	around	in	 th 	 is 	 	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	different	 th 	 is 	 	time	around	.
the	first	was	that	these	 we 	 re 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	just	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	that	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	was	giving	men	--	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 reflect 	 ing 	 	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	shift	in	our	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	second	,	that	the	story	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	just	about	the	crisis	of	men	,	but	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	about	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	women	.
and	now	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	second	set	of	 slide 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 head 	 lines 	 	about	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	with	women	in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	we	never	could	have	 imagin 	 ed 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
women	,	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	 work 	 place 	 	.
and	labor	 statistic 	 s 	 	:	women	take	up	most	 manage 	 rial 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	second	set	of	 head 	 lines 	 	--	you	can	see	that	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	 marriage 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	shift	.
and	look	at	that	last	 head 	 line 	 	--	young	women	 earn 	 ing 	 	more	than	young	men	.
that	 part 	 icular 	 	 head 	 line 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	me	from	a	market	research	firm	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 client 	 s 	 	who	was	going	to	buy	 house 	 s 	 	in	that	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	in	the	future	.
and	they	 expect 	 ed 	 	that	it	would	be	young	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	or	young	men	,	just	like	it	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	they	found	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	.
it	was	young	,	single	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	the	major	 purchase 	 rs 	 	of	 house 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
and	so	they	 decide 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	,	to	do	a	 nation 	 wide 	 	survey	.
so	they	spread	out	all	the	census	data	,	and	what	they	found	,	the	guy	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	 shock 	 er 	 	,	which	is	that	in	1,997	out	of	2,000	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	women	,	young	women	,	 we 	 re 	 	making	more	money	than	young	men	.
so	here	you	have	a	generation	of	young	women	who	grow	up	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	 earn 	 ers 	 	than	the	young	men	around	them	.
now	,	i	've	just	laid	out	the	picture	for	you	,	but	i	still	have	n't	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	you	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	in	a	moment	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	graph	,	and	what	you	'll	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	graph	--	it	 begin 	 s 	 	in	1973	,	just	before	women	start	 flood 	 ing 	 	the	 work 	 force 	 	,	and	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	up	to	our	current	day	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	you	'll	see	is	what	 economist 	 s 	 	talk	about	 a 	 s 	 	the	 polar 	 ization 	 	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
now	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 divid 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	high	-	skill	,	high	-	wage	 job 	 s 	 	and	low	-	skill	,	low	-	wage	 job 	 s 	 	--	and	that	the	middle	,	the	middle	-	skill	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	the	middle	-	 earn 	 ing 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	drop	out	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	for	40	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	 affect 	 ing 	 	men	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	than	it	's	 affect 	 ing 	 	women	.
you	'll	see	the	women	in	red	,	and	you	'll	see	the	men	in	blue	.
you	'll	watch	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	,	but	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	women	and	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	men	.
there	we	go	.
so	watch	that	.	you	see	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	.
watch	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	women	.	watch	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	men	.
the	men	sort	of	 stag 	 n 	 ate 	 	there	,	while	the	women	zoom	up	in	 t 	 hose 	 	high	-	skill	 job 	 s 	 	.
so	what	's	that	about	?
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	women	got	some	power	boost	on	a	video	game	,	or	like	they	snuck	in	some	secret	 s 	 er 	 um 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	birth	-	control	 pill 	 s 	 	that	lets	them	shoot	up	high	.
but	of	course	,	it	's	not	about	that	.
what	it	's	about	is	that	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	a	lot	.
we	used	to	have	a	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	which	was	about	building	 good 	 s 	 	and	 product 	 s 	 	,	and	now	we	have	a	service	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	an	information	and	creative	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	two	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	women	have	 be 	 en 	 	much	better	at	 acquir 	 ing 	 	the	new	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	than	men	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
it	used	to	be	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	guy	who	went	to	high	school	who	did	n't	have	a	college	degree	,	but	you	had	a	specific	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	with	the	help	of	a	 un 	 ion 	 	,	you	could	make	 your 	 self 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	middle	-	class	life	.
but	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	n't	true	 any 	 more 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	new	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 in 	 different 	 	to	 s 	 ize 	 	and	strength	,	which	is	what	's	 help 	 ed 	 	men	 a 	 long 	 	all	these	 year 	 s 	 	.
what	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	now	is	a	whole	different	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	.
you	 bas 	 ically 	 	need	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	you	need	an	ability	to	 s 	 it 	 	still	and	focus	,	to	communicate	 open 	 ly 	 	,	to	be	able	to	listen	to	people	and	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	a	 work 	 place 	 	that	is	much	more	fluid	than	it	used	to	be	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	women	do	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	look	at	management	 theor 	 y 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	it	used	to	be	that	our	ideal	 lead 	 er 	 	 sound 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	general	patton	,	right	?
you	would	be	 is 	 suing 	 	 order 	 s 	 	from	above	.
you	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 hierarch 	 ical 	 	.
you	would	tell	 every 	 one 	 	 be 	 low 	 	you	what	to	do	.
but	that	's	not	what	an	ideal	 lead 	 er 	 	is	like	now	.
if	you	read	management	 book 	 s 	 	now	,	a	 lead 	 er 	 	is	 some 	 body 	 	who	can	foster	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	who	can	get	his	--	get	the	 employ 	 ees 	 	--	see	,	i	still	say	``	his	``	--	who	can	get	the	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	talk	to	each	other	,	who	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	build	 team 	 s 	 	and	get	them	to	be	creative	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	 thing 	 s 	 	that	women	do	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
and	then	on	top	of	that	,	that	's	 create 	 d 	 	a	kind	of	 cascad 	 ing 	 	effect	.
women	enter	the	 work 	 place 	 	at	the	top	,	and	then	at	the	 work 	 ing 	 	class	,	all	the	new	 job 	 s 	 	that	are	 create 	 d 	 	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	that	wives	used	to	do	for	free	at	home	.
so	that	's	 child 	 care 	 	,	elder	care	and	food	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	the	 job 	 s 	 	that	are	growing	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 job 	 s 	 	that	women	tend	to	do	.
now	one	day	it	might	be	that	 mother 	 s 	 	will	hire	an	out	-	of	-	work	,	middle	-	aged	,	 form 	 er 	 	 steel 	 work 	 er 	 	guy	to	watch	 the 	 ir 	 	children	at	home	,	and	that	would	be	good	for	the	men	,	but	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	yet	.
to	see	what	's	going	to	happen	,	you	ca	n't	just	look	at	the	 work 	 force 	 	that	is	now	,	you	have	to	look	at	our	future	 work 	 force 	 	.
and	here	the	story	is	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	.
women	are	 get 	 ting 	 	college	 degree 	 s 	 	at	a	 fast 	 er 	 	rate	than	men	.
why	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	 myster 	 y 	 	.
people	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	men	,	why	do	n't	they	just	go	back	to	college	,	to	community	college	,	say	,	and	 re 	 tool 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	learn	a	new	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	?
well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	they	're	just	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
they	're	used	to	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 provide 	 rs 	 	,	and	they	ca	n't	seem	to	build	the	social	 network 	 s 	 	that	allow	them	to	get	through	college	.
so	for	some	reason	men	just	do	n't	end	up	going	back	to	college	.
and	what	's	even	more	 disturb 	 ing 	 	is	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	 young 	 er 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	about	a	decade	of	research	about	what	people	are	 call 	 ing 	 	the	``	boy	crisis	.	``
now	the	boy	crisis	is	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	 ver 	 y 	 	young	 boy 	 s 	 	,	for	 what 	 ever 	 	reason	,	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	school	than	 ver 	 y 	 	young	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	people	have	 the 	 ories 	 	about	that	.
is	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	an	 excess 	 ively 	 	verbal	curriculum	,	and	little	 girl 	 s 	 	are	better	at	that	than	little	 boy 	 s 	 	?
or	that	we	 requir 	 e 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	still	too	much	,	and	so	 boy 	 s 	 	 initi 	 ally 	 	feel	like	 failure 	 s 	 	?
and	some	people	say	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	9th	grade	,	 boy 	 s 	 	start	dropping	out	of	school	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	writing	a	book	about	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	'm	still	looking	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	so	i	do	n't	have	the	answer	.
but	in	the	mean	time	,	i	'm	going	to	call	on	the	 world 	 wide 	 	education	expert	,	who	's	my	10	-	year	-	old	daughter	,	noah	,	to	talk	to	you	about	why	the	 boy 	 s 	 	in	her	class	do	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
noah	:	the	 girl 	 s 	 	are	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 smart 	 er 	 	.
i	mean	they	have	much	 large 	 r 	 	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	.
they	learn	much	 fast 	 er 	 	.
they	are	more	controlled	.
on	the	board	 to 	 day 	 	for	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	recess	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.
hanna	rosin	:	and	why	is	that	?
noah	:	why	?	they	 we 	 re 	 	just	not	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	class	while	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 s 	 at 	 	there	 ver 	 y 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
hr	:	so	there	you	go	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	thesis	 re 	 ally 	 	came	home	to	me	when	i	went	to	visit	a	college	in	kansas	city	--	 work 	 ing 	 	-	class	college	.
 certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	i	was	in	college	,	i	had	certain	 expect 	 ations 	 	about	my	life	--	that	my	husband	and	i	would	both	work	,	and	that	we	would	 equal 	 ly 	 	raise	the	children	.
but	these	college	 girl 	 s 	 	had	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	view	of	 the 	 ir 	 	future	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	way	they	 s 	 aid 	 	it	to	me	is	that	they	would	be	 work 	 ing 	 	18	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	,	that	 the 	 ir 	 	husband	would	 may 	 be 	 	have	a	job	,	but	that	 most 	 ly 	 	he	would	be	at	home	taking	care	of	the	 kid 	 dies 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	kind	of	a	 shock 	 er 	 	to	me	.
and	then	here	's	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	quote	from	one	of	the	 girl 	 s 	 	:	``	men	are	the	new	ball	and	chain	.	``
now	you	laugh	,	but	that	quote	 ha 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	 s 	 ting 	 	to	it	,	right	?
and	i	think	the	reason	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 ting 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	do	n't	reverse	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	lot	of	pain	,	and	that	's	why	i	talk	about	us	all	going	through	 th 	 is 	 	together	.
the	night	after	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	these	college	 girl 	 s 	 	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	went	to	a	men	's	group	in	kansas	,	and	these	 we 	 re 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	kind	of	 victim 	 s 	 	of	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	which	i	spoke	to	you	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	men	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 contract 	 ors 	 	,	or	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	building	 house 	 s 	 	and	they	had	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	after	the	housing	boom	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	group	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 fail 	 ing 	 	to	pay	 the 	 ir 	 	child	support	.
and	the	 instruct 	 or 	 	was	up	there	in	the	class	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	them	all	the	ways	in	which	they	had	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	age	.
he	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	had	any	moral	 author 	 ity 	 	,	that	 no 	 body 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	them	for	 emotion 	 al 	 	support	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 provide 	 rs 	 	.
so	who	 we 	 re 	 	they	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 dis 	 heart 	 en 	 ing 	 	for	them	.
and	what	he	did	was	he	wrote	down	on	the	board	``	$	85,000	,	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	her	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	,	``	and	then	he	wrote	down	``	$	12,000	.	``
``	that	's	your	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	.
so	who	's	the	man	now	?	``	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	.
``	who	's	the	damn	man	?
she	's	the	man	now	.	``
and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	a	shudder	through	the	room	.
and	that	's	part	of	the	reason	i	like	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	can	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	work	through	it	.
and	the	other	reason	it	's	kind	of	 urge 	 nt 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	just	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	u.s	.
it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	world	.
in	india	,	poor	women	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	english	 fast 	 er 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	male	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	in	order	to	staff	the	new	call	 center 	 s 	 	that	are	growing	in	india	.
in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	a	lot	of	the	 open 	 ing 	 	up	of	private	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	women	are	 start 	 ing 	 	 business 	 es 	 	,	small	 business 	 es 	 	,	 fast 	 er 	 	than	men	.
and	here	's	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	is	in	south	korea	.
over	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	,	south	korea	built	one	of	the	most	 patriarch 	 al 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	we	know	about	.
they	 bas 	 ically 	 	 enshrin 	 ed 	 	the	second	-	class	 stat 	 us 	 	of	women	in	the	civil	code	.
and	if	women	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	birth	male	children	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	like	domestic	 serv 	 ants 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	family	would	pray	to	the	 spirit 	 s 	 	to	kill	off	a	girl	child	so	they	could	have	a	male	child	.
but	over	the	'70s	and	'80s	,	the	south	korea	government	 decide 	 d 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 industrial 	 ize 	 	,	and	so	what	they	did	was	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	push	women	 in 	 to 	 	the	 work 	 force 	 	.
now	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	question	since	1985	:	``	how	 strong 	 ly 	 	do	you	prefer	a	first	-	born	son	?	``
and	now	look	at	the	chart	.
that	's	from	1985	to	2003	.
how	much	do	you	prefer	a	first	-	born	son	?
so	you	can	see	that	these	economic	 change 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	have	a	strong	effect	on	our	culture	.
now	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	fully	 process 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	it	's	kind	of	coming	back	to	us	in	our	pop	culture	in	these	kind	of	weird	and	 exagge 	 rated 	 	ways	,	where	you	can	see	that	the	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	are	changing	.
and	so	we	have	on	the	male	side	what	one	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 like 	 s 	 	to	call	the	``	 o 	 mega 	 	 male 	 s 	 	``	 pop 	 ping 	 	up	,	who	are	the	 male 	 s 	 	who	are	 romantic 	 ally 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 lose 	 rs 	 	who	ca	n't	find	a	job	.
and	they	come	up	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 form 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	the	 perpetu 	 al 	 	adolescent	.
we	have	the	 charm 	 less 	 	 mis 	 anthro 	 pe 	 	.
then	we	have	our	bud	light	guy	who	's	the	happy	couch	potato	.
and	then	here	's	a	 shock 	 er 	 	:	even	america	's	most	 s 	 ex 	 iest 	 	man	 al 	 ive 	 	,	the	 s 	 ex 	 iest 	 	man	 al 	 ive 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 romantic 	 ally 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	in	a	movie	.
and	then	on	the	female	side	,	you	have	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	in	which	you	have	these	crazy	 super 	 hero 	 	women	.
you	've	got	 lad 	 y 	 	gaga	.
you	've	got	our	new	james	bond	,	who	's	angelina	jolie	.
and	it	's	not	just	for	the	young	,	right	?
even	helen	mirren	can	hold	a	gun	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	we	have	to	move	from	 th 	 is 	 	place	where	we	've	got	these	uber	-	 exagge 	 rated 	 	 image 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 feel 	 s 	 	a	little	more	normal	.
so	for	a	long	time	in	the	economic	sphere	,	we	've	lived	with	the	term	``	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.	``
now	i	've	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 like 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	term	.
for	one	thing	,	it	 put 	 s 	 	men	and	women	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 ant 	 agon 	 istic 	 	relationship	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	men	are	these	 dev 	 ious 	 	 trick 	 sters 	 	up	there	who	've	put	up	 th 	 is 	 	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	the	women	.
and	we	have	a	lot	of	skill	and	experience	,	but	it	's	a	trick	,	so	how	are	you	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	to	get	through	that	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	?
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	``	 shatter 	 ing 	 	the	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	``	is	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	phrase	.
would	pop	 the 	 ir 	 	head	through	a	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	?
so	the	image	that	i	like	to	think	of	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	is	the	high	bridge	.
it	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	 terrify 	 ing 	 	to	stand	at	the	foot	of	a	high	bridge	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 exhila 	 rating 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	up	there	,	and	you	're	looking	out	on	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	view	.
and	the	great	thing	is	there	's	no	trick	like	with	the	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	no	man	or	woman	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	middle	about	to	cut	the	 cable 	 s 	 	.
there	's	no	hole	in	the	middle	that	you	're	going	to	fall	through	.
and	the	great	thing	is	that	you	can	take	 any 	 one 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	you	.
you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	your	husband	 a 	 long 	 	.
you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	or	your	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	or	your	babysitter	to	walk	 a 	 long 	 	with	you	.
and	 husband 	 s 	 	can	drag	 the 	 ir 	 	wives	 a 	 cross 	 	,	if	 the 	 ir 	 	wives	do	n't	feel	ready	.
but	the	point	about	the	high	bridge	is	that	you	have	to	have	the	confidence	to	know	that	you	deserve	to	be	on	that	bridge	,	that	you	have	all	the	 skill 	 s 	 	and	experience	you	need	in	order	to	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	the	high	bridge	,	but	you	just	have	to	make	the	decision	to	take	the	first	step	and	do	it	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
