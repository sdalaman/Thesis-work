i	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	task	.
i	'm	a	 spectro 	 scopist 	 	.
i	have	to	talk	about	 astro 	 nomy 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	you	any	single	image	of	 nebul 	 a 	 e 	 	or	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	etc	.
 be 	 cause 	 	my	job	is	 spect 	 roscopy 	 	.
i	never	deal	with	 image 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'll	try	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	 spect 	 roscopy 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	can	change	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
 spect 	 roscopy 	 	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	answer	the	question	,	``	is	there	 any 	 body 	 	out	there	?	``
are	we	 al 	 one 	 	?	seti	.
it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 f 	 un 	 	to	do	 spect 	 roscopy 	 	.
one	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	bulgaria	,	nevena	markova	,	 s 	 pent 	 	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	these	 profile 	 s 	 	.
and	she	 publish 	 ed 	 	42	 article 	 s 	 	just	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	the	subject	.
can	you	imagine	?	day	and	night	,	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 observ 	 ing 	 	,	the	same	star	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.
but	we	are	crazy	.	we	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	that	far	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	about	eight	 month 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	these	 profile 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 notice 	 d 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	symmetry	in	the	profile	of	one	of	the	planet	host	 star 	 s 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	well	 may 	 be 	 	there	is	 lith 	 ium 	 	-	6	in	 th 	 is 	 	star	,	which	is	an	 indic 	 ation 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	star	 ha 	 s 	 	 swallow 	 ed 	 	a	planet	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	you	ca	n't	have	 th 	 is 	 	fragile	isotope	of	 lith 	 ium 	 	-	6	in	the	 atmosphere 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 	-	like	 star 	 s 	 	.
but	you	have	it	in	 planet 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	engulf	planet	or	large	number	of	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	,	you	will	have	 th 	 is 	 	 lith 	 ium 	 	-	6	isotope	in	the	spectrum	of	the	star	.
so	i	 invest 	 ed 	 	more	than	eight	 month 	 s 	 	just	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	profile	of	 th 	 is 	 	star	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	got	phone	 call 	 s 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	 report 	 ers 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	have	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 een 	 	the	planet	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	star	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	they	thought	that	if	you	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	you	are	an	astronomer	so	what	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	in	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
and	you	might	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	planet	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	star	.
and	i	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	no	,	excuse	me	.
what	i	see	is	 th 	 is 	 	one	.	``
it	's	just	 in 	 credible 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	.
i	bet	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 indic 	 ation 	 	that	the	planet	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	star	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
the	power	of	 spect 	 roscopy 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	by	pink	floyd	 al 	 ready 	 	in	1973	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	you	can	get	any	color	you	like	in	a	spectrum	.
and	all	you	need	is	time	and	money	to	make	your	 spectro 	 graph 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	number	one	high	 re 	 solution 	 	,	most	precise	 spectro 	 graph 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 harp 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	to	detect	 extra 	 solar 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	and	sound	 wave 	 s 	 	in	the	 atmosphere 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	.
how	we	get	 spect 	 ra 	 	?
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	most	of	you	know	from	school	physics	that	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 split 	 ting 	 	a	white	light	 in 	 to 	 	 color 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	have	a	liquid	hot	mass	,	it	will	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	which	we	call	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	spectrum	.
a	hot	gas	is	producing	 e 	 mission 	 	lines	 on 	 ly 	 	,	no	 continu 	 um 	 	.
and	if	you	place	a	cool	gas	in	front	of	a	hot	source	,	you	will	see	certain	 pattern 	 s 	 	which	we	call	absorption	lines	.
which	is	used	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	identify	chemical	 element 	 s 	 	in	a	cool	matter	,	which	is	 absorb 	 ing 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	.
now	,	what	we	can	do	with	the	 spect 	 ra 	 	?
we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	line	-	of	-	sight	 velo 	 cities 	 	of	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 object 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	chemical	 com 	 position 	 	and	physical	 parameter 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	,	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	 nebul 	 a 	 e 	 	.
a	star	is	the	most	simple	object	.
in	the	core	,	we	have	 thermo 	 nuclear 	 	 react 	 ions 	 	going	on	,	creating	chemical	 element 	 s 	 	.
and	we	have	a	cool	atmosphere	.
it	's	cool	for	me	.
cool	in	my	 term 	 s 	 	is	three	or	four	or	five	thousand	 degree 	 s 	 	.
my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	infra	-	red	 astro 	 nomy 	 	call	minus	200	kelvin	is	cool	for	them	.
but	you	know	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 relat 	 ive 	 	.
so	for	me	5,000	 degree 	 s 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	spectrum	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	--	24,000	spectral	lines	,	and	about	15	percent	of	these	lines	is	not	yet	identified	.
it	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	so	we	are	in	the	21st	century	,	and	we	still	can	not	 proper 	 ly 	 	understand	the	spectrum	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	have	to	deal	with	just	one	 tin 	 y 	 	,	weak	spectral	line	to	measure	the	 com 	 position 	 	of	that	chemical	element	in	the	atmosphere	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	you	see	the	spectral	line	of	the	gold	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	spectral	line	in	the	spectrum	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	we	use	 th 	 is 	 	weak	feature	to	measure	the	 com 	 position 	 	of	gold	in	the	atmosphere	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	work	in	progress	.
we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	a	 similar 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	weak	feature	,	which	 belong 	 s 	 	to	 os 	 mium 	 	.
it	's	a	heavy	element	 produce 	 d 	 	in	 thermo 	 nuclear 	 	 explosion 	 s 	 	of	 supernova 	 e 	 	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	where	you	can	produce	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 os 	 mium 	 	.
just	 compar 	 ing 	 	the	 com 	 position 	 	of	 os 	 mium 	 	in	one	of	the	planet	host	 star 	 s 	 	,	we	want	to	understand	why	there	is	so	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	element	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	even	think	that	 may 	 be 	 	supernova	 explosion 	 s 	 	trigger	 form 	 ations 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	and	 star 	 s 	 	.
it	can	be	an	 indic 	 ation 	 	.
the	other	day	,	my	 col 	 league 	 	from	berkeley	,	gibor	basri	,	 email 	 ed 	 	me	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	spectrum	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	,	``	can	you	have	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	i	could	n't	sleep	,	next	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	when	i	saw	the	huge	amount	of	oxygen	and	other	 element 	 s 	 	in	the	spectrum	of	the	 star 	 s 	 	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	that	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	that	 observ 	 ed 	 	in	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
it	was	 in 	 credible 	 	.	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	we	could	make	from	 th 	 is 	 	is	clear	evidence	that	there	was	a	supernova	explosion	in	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	which	 pollute 	 d 	 	the	atmosphere	of	 th 	 is 	 	star	.
and	 lat 	 er 	 	a	black	hole	was	 form 	 ed 	 	in	a	 bin 	 ary 	 	system	,	which	is	still	there	with	a	mass	of	about	five	solar	 masse 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 consider 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	first	evidence	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	come	from	 supernova 	 e 	 	 explosion 	 s 	 	.
my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	 compar 	 ing 	 	 com 	 position 	 	of	chemical	 element 	 s 	 	in	different	galactic	 star 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	alien	 star 	 s 	 	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	that	you	can	go	so	far	 simpl 	 y 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	chemical	 com 	 position 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	one	of	the	 star 	 s 	 	you	see	in	the	 spect 	 ra 	 	is	an	alien	.	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	different	 galax 	 y 	 	.
there	is	 interact 	 ion 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	.	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	just	capture	 star 	 s 	 	.
you	've	heard	about	solar	 flare 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	discover	a	super	flare	,	a	flare	which	is	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	 t 	 hose 	 	we	see	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
in	one	of	the	 bin 	 ary 	 	 star 	 s 	 	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	fh	leo	,	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	super	flare	.
and	 lat 	 er 	 	we	went	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	spectral	 star 	 s 	 	to	see	is	there	 any 	 thing 	 	strange	with	these	 object 	 s 	 	.
and	we	found	that	 every 	 thing 	 	is	normal	.
these	 star 	 s 	 	are	normal	like	the	 s 	 un 	 	.	age	,	 every 	 thing 	 	was	normal	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 myster 	 y 	 	.
it	's	one	of	the	 myster 	 ies 	 	we	still	have	,	super	 flare 	 s 	 	.
and	there	are	six	or	seven	similar	 case 	 s 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	in	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
now	to	go	 a 	 head 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	understand	chemical	evolution	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	.	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	you	to	try	to	understand	what	is	here	.
but	it	's	to	show	you	how	 complic 	 ated 	 	is	the	whole	story	of	the	production	of	chemical	 element 	 s 	 	.
you	have	two	 channel 	 s 	 	--	the	massive	 star 	 s 	 	and	low	-	mass	 star 	 s 	 	--	producing	and	 recycl 	 ing 	 	matter	and	chemical	 element 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	14	billion	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	end	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	graph	,	 show 	 ing 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	 abundance 	 s 	 	of	chemical	 element 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 un 	 	-	like	 star 	 s 	 	and	in	the	 inter 	 stellar 	 	medium	.
so	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	find	an	object	where	you	find	about	10	 time 	 s 	 	more	sulfur	than	silicon	,	five	 time 	 s 	 	more	 calc 	 ium 	 	than	oxygen	.	it	's	just	 im 	 possible 	 	.
and	if	you	find	one	,	i	will	say	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	related	to	seti	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	you	ca	n't	do	it	.
doppler	effect	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	from	fundamental	physics	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	related	to	the	change	of	the	frequency	of	a	moving	source	.
the	doppler	effect	is	used	to	discover	 extra 	 solar 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	.
the	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	which	we	need	to	discover	a	jupiter	-	like	planet	around	a	 s 	 un 	 	-	like	star	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	28.4	 meter 	 s 	 	per	second	.
and	we	need	nine	 centimeter 	 s 	 	per	second	to	detect	an	earth	-	like	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	with	the	future	 spectro 	 graph 	 s 	 	.
i	,	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	team	which	is	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	 cod 	 ex 	 	,	high	 re 	 solution 	 	,	future	generation	 spectro 	 graph 	 	for	the	42	meter	e-elt	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	an	instrument	to	detect	earth	-	like	 planet 	 s 	 	around	 s 	 un 	 	-	like	 star 	 s 	 	.
it	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	tool	 call 	 ed 	 	 astro 	 seismo 	 logy 	 	where	we	can	detect	sound	 wave 	 s 	 	in	the	 atmosphere 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sound	of	an	alpha	cen	.
we	can	detect	sound	 wave 	 s 	 	in	the	 atmosphere 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 	-	like	 star 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	have	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	in	 infra 	 sound 	 	domain	,	the	sound	 actual 	 ly 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	domain	.
coming	back	to	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	question	,	``	is	there	 any 	 body 	 	out	there	?	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	 close 	 ly 	 	related	to	tectonic	and	 volcan 	 ic 	 	activity	of	 planet 	 s 	 	.
 connect 	 ion 	 	between	life	and	 radio 	 active 	 	nuclei	is	 straight 	 forward 	 	.
no	life	 with 	 out 	 	tectonic	activity	,	 with 	 out 	 	 volcan 	 ic 	 	activity	.
and	we	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	that	 geo 	 thermal 	 	energy	is	 most 	 ly 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	by	decay	of	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	,	 th 	 orium 	 	,	and	 pot 	 ass 	 ium 	 	.
how	to	measure	,	if	we	have	 planet 	 s 	 	where	the	amount	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 element 	 s 	 	is	small	,	so	 t 	 hose 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	are	 tectonic 	 ally 	 	dead	,	there	can	not	be	life	.
if	there	is	too	much	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	or	 pot 	 ass 	 ium 	 	or	 th 	 orium 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	there	would	be	no	life	.
 be 	 cause 	 	can	you	imagine	 every 	 thing 	 	 boil 	 ing 	 	?
it	's	too	much	energy	on	a	planet	.
now	,	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 measur 	 ing 	 	abundance	of	 th 	 orium 	 	in	one	of	the	 star 	 s 	 	with	 extra 	 solar 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	game	.	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	feature	.
we	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	measure	 th 	 is 	 	profile	and	to	detect	 th 	 orium 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	.
and	you	have	to	,	first	you	have	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.
then	you	have	to	 con 	 vince 	 	your	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	have	to	 con 	 vince 	 	the	whole	world	that	you	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 detect 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	atmosphere	of	an	 extra 	 solar 	 	planet	host	star	 some 	 where 	 	in	100	 parse 	 c 	 	away	from	here	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	.
but	if	you	want	to	know	about	a	life	on	 extra 	 solar 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	job	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	know	how	much	of	 radio 	 active 	 	element	you	have	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
the	one	way	to	discover	about	 alien 	 s 	 	is	to	tune	your	radio	 tele 	 scope 	 	and	listen	to	the	 signal 	 s 	 	.
if	you	 receiv 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	well	that	's	what	seti	 do 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	seti	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	think	the	most	promising	way	is	to	go	for	 bio 	 marker 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	the	spectrum	of	the	earth	,	 th 	 is 	 	earthshine	spectrum	,	and	that	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	signal	.
the	 slop 	 e 	 	which	is	coming	,	which	we	call	a	red	edge	,	is	a	 detect 	 ion 	 	of	 veget 	 ated 	 	area	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	that	we	can	detect	 veget 	 ation 	 	from	a	spectrum	.
now	imagine	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	test	for	other	 planet 	 s 	 	.
now	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	last	six	,	seven	,	eight	 month 	 s 	 	,	water	,	 m 	 ethane 	 	,	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 detect 	 ed 	 	in	the	spectrum	of	a	planet	 out 	 side 	 	the	solar	system	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	power	of	 spect 	 roscopy 	 	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	and	detect	and	 stud 	 y 	 	a	chemical	 com 	 position 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	far	,	far	,	far	from	solar	system	.
we	have	to	detect	oxygen	or	 o 	 zone 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	have	all	 necess 	 ary 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	to	have	life	.
 cosm 	 ic 	 	 miracle 	 s 	 	are	 some 	 thing 	 	which	can	be	related	to	seti	.
now	imagine	an	object	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 	object	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	which	we	can	not	explain	when	we	just	stand	up	and	say	,	``	look	,	we	give	up	.	physics	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.	``
so	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	which	you	can	 al 	 ways 	 	refer	to	seti	and	say	,	``	well	,	 some 	 body 	 	must	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	.	``
and	with	the	known	physics	etc	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	out	by	frank	drake	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	shklovsky	.
if	you	see	,	in	the	spectrum	of	a	planet	host	star	,	if	you	see	strange	chemical	 element 	 s 	 	,	it	can	be	a	signal	from	a	 civil 	 ization 	 	which	is	there	and	they	want	to	signal	about	it	.
they	want	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	signal	 the 	 ir 	 	presence	through	these	spectral	lines	,	in	the	spectrum	of	a	star	,	in	different	ways	.
there	can	be	different	ways	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	is	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 tech 	 net 	 ium 	 	is	a	 radio 	 active 	 	element	with	a	decay	time	of	4.2	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	you	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 observ 	 e 	 	 tech 	 net 	 ium 	 	in	a	 s 	 un 	 	-	like	star	,	you	can	be	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	put	 th 	 is 	 	element	in	the	atmosphere	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	a	natural	way	it	is	 im 	 possible 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	we	are	 review 	 ing 	 	the	 spect 	 ra 	 	of	about	300	 star 	 s 	 	with	 extra 	 solar 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	.
and	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	job	since	2000	and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	heavy	project	.
we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
and	we	have	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	 candid 	 ates 	 	,	so	on	,	 thing 	 s 	 	which	we	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	explain	.
and	i	hope	in	the	near	future	we	can	confirm	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	the	main	question	:	``	are	we	 al 	 one 	 	?	``
i	think	it	will	not	come	from	ufos	.
it	will	not	come	from	radio	 signal 	 s 	 	.
i	think	it	will	come	from	a	spectrum	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	is	the	spectrum	of	a	planet	like	earth	,	 show 	 ing 	 	a	presence	of	nitrogen	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	clear	signal	of	life	,	and	oxygen	and	 o 	 zone 	 	.
if	,	one	day	,	and	i	think	it	will	be	 with 	 in 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	or	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	we	discover	a	spectrum	like	 th 	 is 	 	we	can	be	 s 	 ure 	 	that	there	is	life	on	that	planet	.
in	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	we	will	discover	 planet 	 s 	 	like	earth	,	around	 s 	 un 	 	-	like	 star 	 s 	 	,	the	same	distance	 a 	 s 	 	the	earth	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
it	will	take	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	will	need	 an 	 other 	 	10	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	with	space	 project 	 s 	 	to	get	the	 spect 	 ra 	 	of	earth	-	like	 planet 	 s 	 	like	the	one	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
and	if	we	see	the	nitrogen	 di 	 oxide 	 	and	oxygen	,	i	think	we	have	the	perfect	e.t	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
