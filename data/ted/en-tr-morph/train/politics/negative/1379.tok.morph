the	children	's	 tele 	 vision 	 	host	mr.	rogers	 al 	 ways 	 	carried	in	his	wallet	a	quote	from	a	social	 work 	 er 	 	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	there	is	n't	 any 	 one 	 	you	could	n't	learn	to	love	once	you	've	heard	 the 	 ir 	 	story	.	``
and	the	way	i	like	to	interpret	that	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	story	 command 	 ment 	 	,	which	is	``	make	me	care	``	--	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	 emotion 	 ally 	 	,	 intellectual 	 ly 	 	,	 aesthetic 	 ally 	 	,	just	make	me	care	.
we	all	know	what	it	's	like	to	not	care	.

it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 half 	 way 	 	over	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	's	caught	you	and	you	're	drawn	in	and	you	care	.
that	's	not	by	chance	,	that	's	by	design	.
so	it	got	me	 think 	 ing 	 	,	what	if	i	told	you	my	 histo 	 ry 	 	was	story	,	how	i	was	born	for	it	,	how	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	 th 	 is 	 	subject	matter	?
and	to	make	it	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	we	'll	start	from	the	 end 	 ing 	 	and	we	'll	go	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
and	so	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	give	you	the	 end 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	it	would	go	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	and	that	's	what	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	led	me	to	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	you	here	at	ted	about	story	.
and	the	most	current	story	 less 	 on 	 	that	i	've	had	was	 comple 	 ting 	 	the	film	i	've	just	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	in	2012	.
the	film	is	``	john	carter	.	``	it	's	based	on	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 prince 	 s 	 s 	 	of	mars	,	``	which	was	written	by	edgar	rice	burroughs	.
and	edgar	rice	burroughs	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	 him 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	character	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	movie	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 nar 	 rator 	 	.

 a 	 s 	 	:	what	 th 	 is 	 	scene	is	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	did	in	the	book	,	is	it	's	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	making	a	promise	.
it	's	making	a	promise	to	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	story	will	lead	 some 	 where 	 	that	's	worth	your	time	.
and	that	's	what	all	good	 st 	 ories 	 	should	do	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	is	they	should	give	you	a	promise	.
you	could	do	it	an	infinite	amount	of	ways	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	simple	 a 	 s 	 	``	once	 up 	 on 	 	a	time	...	``	these	carter	 book 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	had	edgar	rice	burroughs	 a 	 s 	 	a	 nar 	 rator 	 	in	it	.
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	fantastic	 de 	 vice 	 	.
it	's	like	a	guy	 invit 	 ing 	 	you	around	the	 camp 	 fire 	 	,	or	 some 	 body 	 	in	a	bar	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	here	,	let	me	tell	you	a	story	.
it	did	n't	happen	to	me	,	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	else	,	but	it	's	going	to	be	worth	your	time	.	``
a	well	told	promise	is	like	a	 pe 	 bble 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 pull 	 ed 	 	back	in	a	 s 	 ling 	 shot 	 	and	 propel 	 s 	 	you	forward	through	the	story	to	the	end	.
in	2008	,	i	 push 	 ed 	 	all	the	 the 	 ories 	 	that	i	had	on	story	at	the	time	to	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	my	 understand 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
♫	and	that	is	all	♫	♫	that	love	's	about	♫	♫	and	we	'll	recall	♫	♫	when	time	 run 	 s 	 	out	♫	♫	that	it	 on 	 ly 	 	♫	 a 	 s 	 	:	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	.
it	's	the	 pur 	 est 	 	form	of	 cinema 	 tic 	 	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	the	most	inclusive	approach	you	can	take	.
it	 confirm 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	had	a	hunch	on	,	is	that	the	audience	 actual 	 ly 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	work	for	 the 	 ir 	 	meal	.
they	just	do	n't	want	to	know	that	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
that	's	your	job	 a 	 s 	 	a	 story 	 teller 	 	,	is	to	hide	the	fact	that	you	're	making	them	work	for	 the 	 ir 	 	meal	.
we	're	born	problem	 solve 	 rs 	 	.
we	're	 compel 	 led 	 	to	deduce	and	to	deduct	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	we	do	in	real	life	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	well	-	 organize 	 d 	 	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	information	that	 draw 	 s 	 	us	in	.
there	's	a	reason	that	we	're	all	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	an	infant	or	a	puppy	.
it	's	not	just	that	they	're	damn	cute	;	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	they	ca	n't	 complete 	 ly 	 	express	what	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	and	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 intent 	 ions 	 	are	.
and	it	's	like	a	magnet	.
we	ca	n't	stop	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 want 	 ing 	 	to	complete	the	sentence	and	fill	it	in	.
i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	when	i	was	writing	with	bob	peterson	on	``	 find 	 ing 	 	nemo	.	``
and	we	would	call	 th 	 is 	 	the	 un 	 ifying 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	of	two	plus	two	.
make	the	audience	put	 thing 	 s 	 	together	.
do	n't	give	them	four	,	give	them	two	plus	two	.
the	 element 	 s 	 	you	provide	and	the	order	you	place	them	in	is	 cruci 	 al 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	you	succeed	or	fail	at	 engag 	 ing 	 	the	audience	.
 editor 	 s 	 	and	 screen 	 writer 	 s 	 	have	known	 th 	 is 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	.
it	's	the	 in 	 visible 	 	application	that	 hold 	 s 	 	our	attention	to	story	.
i	do	n't	mean	to	make	it	sound	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	actual	exact	science	,	it	's	not	.
that	's	what	's	so	special	about	 st 	 ories 	 	,	they	're	not	a	widget	,	they	are	n't	exact	.
 st 	 ories 	 	are	 inevit 	 able 	 	,	if	they	're	good	,	but	they	're	not	 predict 	 able 	 	.
i	took	a	 semi 	 nar 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	year	with	an	 act 	 ing 	 	teacher	named	judith	weston	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	key	 in 	 sight 	 	to	character	.
she	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	all	well	-	drawn	 character 	 s 	 	have	a	 s 	 pine 	 	.
and	the	idea	is	that	the	character	 ha 	 s 	 	an	inner	motor	,	a	 domin 	 ant 	 	,	 un 	 conscious 	 	goal	that	they	're	 striv 	 ing 	 	for	,	an	itch	that	they	ca	n't	scratch	.
she	 g 	 ave 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	michael	corleone	,	al	pacino	's	character	in	``	the	 god 	 father 	 	,	``	and	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	his	 s 	 pine 	 	was	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	his	father	.
and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	drove	all	his	 choice 	 s 	 	.
even	after	his	father	 di 	 ed 	 	,	he	was	still	 try 	 ing 	 	to	scratch	that	itch	.
i	took	to	 th 	 is 	 	like	a	duck	to	water	.
wall	-	e	's	was	to	find	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
 mar 	 lin 	 	's	,	the	father	in	``	 find 	 ing 	 	nemo	,	``	was	to	prevent	harm	.
and	 wood 	 y 	 	's	was	to	do	what	was	best	for	his	child	.
and	these	 spin 	 es 	 	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	drive	you	to	make	the	best	 choice 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	can	make	some	 horr 	 ible 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	with	them	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 bless 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	parent	,	and	 watch 	 ing 	 	my	children	grow	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 firm 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	you	're	born	with	a	temperament	and	you	're	wired	a	certain	way	,	and	you	do	n't	have	any	say	about	it	,	and	there	's	no	changing	it	.
all	you	can	do	is	learn	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	it	and	own	it	.
and	some	of	us	are	born	with	 temperament 	 s 	 	that	are	positive	,	some	are	negative	.
but	a	major	threshold	is	 pass 	 ed 	 	when	you	mature	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	what	 drive 	 s 	 	you	and	to	take	the	wheel	and	steer	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	you	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	who	your	children	are	.
they	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	who	they	are	.
and	you	're	still	 learn 	 ing 	 	who	you	are	.
so	we	're	all	 learn 	 ing 	 	all	the	time	.
and	that	's	why	change	is	fundamental	in	story	.
if	 thing 	 s 	 	go	static	,	 st 	 ories 	 	die	,	 be 	 cause 	 	life	is	never	static	.
in	1998	,	i	had	 finish 	 ed 	 	writing	``	 to 	 y 	 	story	``	and	``	a	bug	's	life	``	and	i	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 hook 	 ed 	 	on	 screen 	 writing 	 	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	much	better	at	it	and	learn	 any 	 thing 	 	i	could	.
so	i	 research 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	i	possibly	could	.
and	i	 final 	 ly 	 	came	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	quote	by	a	british	playwright	,	william	archer	:	``	drama	is	 anticip 	 ation 	 	 mingle 	 d 	 	with	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.	``
it	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 in 	 sight 	 ful 	 	definition	.
when	you	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	story	,	have	you	 construct 	 ed 	 	 anticip 	 ation 	 	?
in	the	short	-	term	,	have	you	made	me	want	to	know	what	will	happen	next	?
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	have	you	made	me	want	to	know	how	it	will	all	conclude	in	the	long	-	term	?
have	you	 construct 	 ed 	 	honest	 conflict 	 s 	 	with	truth	that	 create 	 s 	 	doubt	in	what	the	 out 	 come 	 	might	be	?
an	 ex 	 ample 	 	would	be	in	``	 find 	 ing 	 	nemo	,	``	in	the	short	tension	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	,	would	 d 	 ory 	 	's	short	-	term	 memor 	 y 	 	make	her	forget	 what 	 ever 	 	she	was	 be 	 ing 	 	told	by	 mar 	 lin 	 	.
but	under	that	was	 th 	 is 	 	global	tension	of	will	we	ever	find	nemo	in	 th 	 is 	 	huge	,	vast	ocean	?
in	our	 ear 	 liest 	 	 day 	 s 	 	at	pixar	,	before	we	 tru 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	the	 in 	 visible 	 	 work 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	story	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	group	of	 guy 	 s 	 	just	going	on	our	gut	,	going	on	our	 instinct 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	see	how	that	led	us	 place 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
you	've	got	to	remember	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	time	of	year	,	1993	,	what	was	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	 success 	 ful 	 	 animate 	 d 	 	picture	was	``	the	little	 mer 	 maid 	 	,	``	``	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	the	beast	,	``	``	aladdin	,	``	``	lion	king	.	``
so	when	we	 pitch 	 ed 	 	``	 to 	 y 	 	story	``	to	tom	hanks	for	the	first	time	,	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	do	n't	want	me	to	 s 	 ing 	 	,	do	you	?	``
and	i	thought	that	 epitomize 	 d 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	what	 every 	 body 	 	thought	 anim 	 ation 	 	had	to	be	at	the	time	.
but	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	prove	that	you	could	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	in	 anim 	 ation 	 	.
we	did	n't	have	any	influence	then	,	so	we	had	a	little	secret	list	of	 rule 	 s 	 	that	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	:	no	 song 	 s 	 	,	no	``	i	want	``	moment	,	no	happy	village	,	no	love	story	.
and	the	 iron 	 y 	 	is	that	,	in	the	first	year	,	our	story	was	not	 work 	 ing 	 	at	all	and	disney	was	 panic 	 king 	 	.
so	they	 private 	 ly 	 	got	 ad 	 vice 	 	from	a	famous	 lyric 	 ist 	 	,	who	i	wo	n't	name	,	and	he	 fax 	 ed 	 	them	some	 suggest 	 ions 	 	.
and	we	got	a	hold	of	that	fax	.
and	the	fax	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	should	be	 song 	 s 	 	,	there	should	be	an	``	i	want	``	song	,	there	should	be	a	happy	village	song	,	there	should	be	a	love	story	and	there	should	be	a	 villa 	 in 	 	.
and	thank	 good 	 ness 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	too	young	,	 re 	 bell 	 ious 	 	and	 contr 	 arian 	 	at	the	time	.
that	just	 g 	 ave 	 	us	more	 determi 	 nation 	 	to	prove	that	you	could	build	a	better	story	.
and	a	year	after	that	,	we	did	conquer	it	.
and	it	just	went	to	prove	that	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 guide 	 lines 	 	,	not	hard	,	fast	 rule 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	fundamental	thing	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	about	 lik 	 ing 	 	your	main	character	.
and	we	had	 naive 	 ly 	 	thought	,	well	 wood 	 y 	 	in	``	 to 	 y 	 	story	``	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 self 	 less 	 	at	the	end	,	so	you	've	got	to	start	from	 some 	 place 	 	.

and	that	's	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	,	is	that	we	all	live	life	 condition 	 ally 	 	.
we	're	all	 will 	 ing 	 	to	play	by	the	 rule 	 s 	 	and	follow	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	certain	 condition 	 s 	 	are	met	.

and	before	i	'd	even	 decide 	 d 	 	to	make	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	,	i	can	now	see	key	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	my	youth	that	 re 	 ally 	 	sort	of	 open 	 ed 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	to	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	about	story	.
in	1986	,	i	 tru 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	story	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	theme	.
and	that	was	the	year	that	they	 resto 	 red 	 	and	re	-	released	``	lawrence	of	arabia	.	``
and	i	saw	that	thing	seven	 time 	 s 	 	in	one	month	.
i	could	n't	get	 en 	 ough 	 	of	it	.
i	could	just	tell	there	was	a	grand	design	under	it	--	in	every	shot	,	every	scene	,	every	line	.
yet	,	on	the	surface	it	just	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	 depict 	 ing 	 	his	 historic 	 al 	 	 line 	 age 	 	of	what	went	on	.
yet	,	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	.	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	was	it	?
and	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	,	on	one	of	my	 lat 	 er 	 	 view 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	that	the	veil	was	 lift 	 ed 	 	and	it	was	in	a	scene	where	he	's	 walk 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sinai	desert	and	he	's	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	suez	 can 	 al 	 	,	and	i	 sudden 	 ly 	 	got	it	.
boy	:	 he 	 y 	 	!	 he 	 y 	 	!	 he 	 y 	 	!	 he 	 y 	 	!
cyclist	:	who	are	you	?
who	are	you	?
 a 	 s 	 	:	that	was	the	theme	:	who	are	you	?
here	 we 	 re 	 	all	these	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	disparate	 event 	 s 	 	and	 dia 	 logues 	 	that	just	 we 	 re 	 	 chrono 	 logically 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	him	,	but	 under 	 neath 	 	it	was	a	constant	,	a	 guide 	 line 	 	,	a	road	map	.
 every 	 thing 	 	lawrence	did	in	that	movie	was	an	attempt	for	him	to	figure	out	where	his	place	was	in	the	world	.
a	strong	theme	is	 al 	 ways 	 	running	through	a	well	-	told	story	.
when	i	was	five	,	i	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	possibly	the	most	major	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	that	i	feel	a	story	should	have	,	but	is	 rare 	 ly 	 	 invoke 	 d 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	my	mother	took	me	to	when	i	was	five	.
thumper	:	come	on	.	it	's	all	right	.
look	.
the	water	's	stiff	.
bambi	:	yippee	!
thumper	:	some	 f 	 un 	 	,	huh	,	bambi	?
come	on	.	get	up	.
like	 th 	 is 	 	.
ha	ha	.	no	,	no	,	no	.
 a 	 s 	 	:	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	of	there	wide	-	eyed	with	wonder	.
and	that	's	what	i	think	the	magic	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	is	,	the	secret	sauce	,	is	can	you	invoke	wonder	.
wonder	is	honest	,	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	.
it	ca	n't	be	 artificial 	 ly 	 	 evoke 	 d 	 	.
for	me	,	there	's	no	 great 	 er 	 	ability	than	the	gift	of	 an 	 other 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	giving	you	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	--	to	hold	them	still	just	for	a	brief	moment	in	 the 	 ir 	 	day	and	have	them	surrender	to	wonder	.
when	it	's	 ta 	 pped 	 	,	the	 affirm 	 ation 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	,	it	 reach 	 es 	 	you	 al 	 most 	 	to	a	cellular	level	.
and	when	an	artist	 do 	 es 	 	that	to	 an 	 other 	 	artist	,	it	's	like	you	're	 compel 	 led 	 	to	pass	it	on	.
it	's	like	a	 dorm 	 ant 	 	command	that	 sudden 	 ly 	 	is	 activate 	 d 	 	in	you	,	like	a	call	to	devil	's	tower	.
do	 un 	 to 	 	 other 	 s 	 	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	you	.
the	best	 st 	 ories 	 	 in 	 fuse 	 	wonder	.
when	i	was	four	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	have	a	 vivi 	 d 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	of	 find 	 ing 	 	two	 pin 	 point 	 	 scar 	 s 	 	on	my	ankle	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	my	dad	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	i	had	a	 match 	 ing 	 	pair	like	that	on	my	head	,	but	i	could	n't	see	them	 be 	 cause 	 	of	my	hair	.
and	he	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	when	i	was	born	,	i	was	born	 pre 	 mature 	 	,	that	i	came	out	much	too	early	,	and	i	was	n't	fully	 bake 	 d 	 	;	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	sick	.
and	when	the	doctor	took	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	yellow	kid	with	black	 tee 	 th 	 	,	he	 look 	 ed 	 	straight	at	my	mom	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	he	's	not	going	to	live	.	``
and	i	was	in	the	hospital	for	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	blood	 trans 	 fusion 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	lived	,	and	that	made	me	special	.
i	do	n't	know	if	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	.
i	do	n't	know	if	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	,	but	i	did	n't	want	to	prove	them	wrong	.
 what 	 ever 	 	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	good	at	,	i	would	 striv 	 e 	 	to	be	worthy	of	the	second	chance	i	was	 give 	 n 	 	.
 mar 	 lin 	 	:	there	,	there	,	there	.
it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 d 	 addy 	 	's	here	.
 d 	 addy 	 	's	got	you	.
i	promise	,	i	will	never	let	 any 	 thing 	 	happen	to	you	,	nemo	.
 a 	 s 	 	:	and	that	's	the	first	story	 less 	 on 	 	i	ever	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
use	what	you	know	.	draw	from	it	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	mean	plot	or	fact	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	a	truth	from	your	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	it	,	 express 	 ing 	 	 value 	 s 	 	you	 personal 	 ly 	 	feel	deep	down	in	your	core	.
and	that	's	what	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	led	me	to	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	you	here	at	tedtalk	 to 	 day 	 	.
thank	you	.
