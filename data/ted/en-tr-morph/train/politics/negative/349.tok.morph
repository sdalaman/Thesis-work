hi	.	i	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	praise	,	 admi 	 ration 	 	and	thank	you	,	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	it	be	specific	and	genuine	.
and	the	way	i	got	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	in	 my 	 self 	 	,	when	i	was	growing	up	,	and	 un 	 til 	 	about	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	i	would	want	to	say	thank	you	to	 some 	 one 	 	,	i	would	want	to	praise	them	,	i	would	want	to	take	in	 the 	 ir 	 	praise	of	me	and	i	'd	just	stop	it	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	why	?
i	felt	 s 	 hy 	 	,	i	felt	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	my	question	 be 	 came 	 	,	am	i	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	who	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
so	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	investigate	.
i	'm	fortunate	 en 	 ough 	 	to	work	in	the	rehab	 facil 	 ity 	 	,	so	i	get	to	see	people	who	are	facing	life	and	death	with	 addict 	 ion 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	simple	 a 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	core	wound	is	 the 	 ir 	 	father	 di 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	ever	 say 	 ing 	 	he	's	proud	of	them	.
but	then	,	they	hear	from	all	the	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	that	the	father	told	 every 	 body 	 	else	that	he	was	proud	of	him	,	but	he	never	told	the	son	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	he	did	n't	know	that	his	son	 need 	 ed 	 	to	hear	it	.
so	my	question	is	,	why	do	n't	we	ask	for	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	need	?
i	know	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	,	married	for	25	 year 	 s 	 	,	who	's	 long 	 ing 	 	to	hear	his	wife	say	,	``	thank	you	for	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 bread 	 winner 	 	,	so	i	can	stay	home	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	``	but	wo	n't	ask	.
i	know	a	woman	who	's	good	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
she	,	once	a	week	,	 meet 	 s 	 	with	her	husband	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	like	you	to	thank	me	for	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	i	did	in	the	house	and	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.	``
and	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	.	``
and	praise	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	have	to	be	genuine	,	but	she	 take 	 s 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	that	.
and	a	friend	of	mine	,	april	,	who	i	've	had	since	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	,	she	 thank 	 s 	 	her	children	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 chore 	 s 	 	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	would	n't	i	thank	it	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	it	?	``
so	,	the	question	is	,	why	was	i	 block 	 ing 	 	it	?
why	 we 	 re 	 	other	people	 block 	 ing 	 	it	?
why	can	i	say	,	``	i	'll	take	my	steak	medium	rare	,	i	need	 s 	 ize 	 	six	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	``	but	i	wo	n't	say	,	``	would	you	praise	me	 th 	 is 	 	way	?	``
and	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	giving	you	critical	data	about	me	.
i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	where	i	'm	 in 	 secure 	 	.
i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	where	i	need	your	help	.
and	i	'm	 treat 	 ing 	 	you	,	my	inner	circle	,	like	you	're	the	 ene 	 my 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	can	you	do	with	that	data	?
you	could	neglect	me	.
you	could	abuse	it	.
or	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	meet	my	need	.
and	i	took	my	bike	 in 	 to 	 	the	bike	store	--	i	love	 th 	 is 	 	--	same	bike	,	and	they	'd	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 tru 	 ing 	 	``	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	.
the	guy	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	when	you	true	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	,	it	's	going	to	make	the	bike	so	much	better	.	``
i	get	the	same	bike	back	,	and	they	've	taken	all	the	little	 warp 	 s 	 	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	same	 wheel 	 s 	 	i	've	had	for	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	my	bike	is	like	new	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	all	of	you	.
i	want	you	to	true	your	 wheel 	 s 	 	:	be	honest	about	the	praise	that	you	need	to	hear	.
what	do	you	need	to	hear	?	go	home	to	your	wife	--	go	ask	her	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	she	need	?
go	home	to	your	husband	--	what	 do 	 es 	 	he	need	?
go	home	and	ask	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	then	help	the	people	around	you	.
and	it	's	simple	.
and	why	should	we	care	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
we	talk	about	world	peace	.
how	can	we	have	world	peace	with	different	 culture 	 s 	 	,	different	 language 	 s 	 	?
i	think	it	 start 	 s 	 	 house 	 hold 	 	by	 house 	 hold 	 	,	under	the	same	roof	.
so	,	let	's	make	it	right	in	our	own	 back 	 yard 	 	.
and	i	want	to	thank	all	of	you	in	the	audience	for	 be 	 ing 	 	great	 husband 	 s 	 	,	great	 mother 	 s 	 	,	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 daughter 	 s 	 	,	 son 	 s 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	 some 	 body 	 	's	never	 s 	 aid 	 	that	to	you	,	but	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	good	job	.
and	thank	you	for	 be 	 ing 	 	here	,	just	 show 	 ing 	 	up	and	changing	the	world	with	your	 idea 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
