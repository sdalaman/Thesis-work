i	was	 af 	 raid 	 	of	 woman 	 hood 	 	.
not	that	i	'm	not	 af 	 raid 	 	now	,	but	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	pretend	.
i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	be	 flex 	 ible 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	to	help	me	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	fear	.
let	me	explain	.
back	in	the	'50s	and	'60s	,	when	i	was	growing	up	,	little	 girl 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	kind	and	 thought 	 ful 	 	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	and	gentle	and	soft	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	fit	 in 	 to 	 	 role 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	sort	of	 shadow 	 y 	 	--	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 quit 	 e 	 	clear	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	role	 model 	 s 	 	all	around	us	.
we	had	our	 mother 	 s 	 	,	our	 aunt 	 s 	 	,	our	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	our	 sister 	 s 	 	,	and	of	course	,	the	ever	-	present	media	 bombard 	 ing 	 	us	with	 image 	 s 	 	and	 word 	 s 	 	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	how	to	be	.
now	my	mother	was	different	.
she	was	a	 home 	 maker 	 	,	but	she	and	i	did	n't	go	out	and	do	 girl 	 ie 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	,	and	she	did	n't	buy	me	pink	 out 	 fit 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	she	 k 	 new 	 	what	i	 need 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	 b 	 ought 	 	me	a	book	of	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
and	i	just	ate	it	up	.
i	drew	,	and	i	drew	,	and	since	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	humor	was	 accept 	 able 	 	in	my	family	,	i	could	draw	,	do	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	,	and	not	have	to	perform	,	not	have	to	speak	--	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 hy 	 	--	and	i	could	still	get	approval	.
i	was	 launch 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	.
now	when	we	're	young	,	we	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	know	.	we	know	there	are	 rule 	 s 	 	out	there	,	but	we	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	know	--	we	do	n't	perform	them	right	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	are	 im 	 print 	 ed 	 	at	birth	with	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	told	what	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	color	in	the	world	is	.
we	're	told	what	shape	we	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	in	.
we	're	told	what	to	wear	--	--	and	how	to	do	our	hair	--	--	and	how	to	 behav 	 e 	 	.
now	the	 rule 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 monitor 	 ed 	 	by	the	culture	.
we	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 correct 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 police 	 men 	 	are	women	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	the	 car 	 rier 	 s 	 	of	the	tradition	.
we	pass	it	down	from	generation	to	generation	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	--	we	 al 	 ways 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	vague	 not 	 ion 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	's	 expect 	 ed 	 	of	us	.
and	on	top	of	all	off	these	 rule 	 s 	 	,	they	keep	changing	.
we	do	n't	know	what	's	going	on	half	the	time	,	so	it	 put 	 s 	 	us	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ten 	 uous 	 	position	.
now	if	you	do	n't	like	these	 rule 	 s 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	do	n't	--	i	know	i	did	n't	,	and	i	still	do	n't	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	follow	them	half	the	time	,	not	 quit 	 e 	 	aware	that	i	'm	 follow 	 ing 	 	them	--	what	better	way	than	to	change	them	[	than	]	with	humor	?
humor	 re 	 lies 	 	on	the	 tradition 	 s 	 	of	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	what	we	know	,	and	it	 twist 	 s 	 	it	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	the	 code 	 s 	 	of	behavior	and	the	 code 	 s 	 	of	dress	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	's	what	 elicit 	 s 	 	a	laugh	.
now	what	if	you	put	together	women	and	humor	?
i	think	you	can	get	change	.
 be 	 cause 	 	women	are	on	the	ground	floor	,	and	we	know	the	 tradition 	 s 	 	so	well	,	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	a	different	voice	to	the	table	.
now	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	in	the	middle	of	a	lot	of	 cha 	 os 	 	.
i	grew	up	not	far	from	here	in	washington	d.c	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	the	 assassin 	 ations 	 	,	the	watergate	 hear 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	then	the	feminist	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	i	think	i	was	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	was	going	on	.
and	then	 al 	 so 	 	my	family	was	in	 cha 	 os 	 	,	and	i	drew	to	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	my	family	together	--	--	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	my	family	together	with	laughter	.
it	did	n't	work	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	got	 divorce 	 d 	 	,	and	my	sister	was	 arrest 	 ed 	 	.
but	i	found	my	place	.
i	found	that	i	did	n't	have	to	wear	high	 heel 	 s 	 	,	i	did	n't	have	to	wear	pink	,	and	i	could	feel	like	i	fit	in	.
now	when	i	was	a	little	 old 	 er 	 	,	in	my	20s	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	there	are	not	 man 	 y 	 	women	in	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	``	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	can	break	the	little	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	of	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	,	``	and	so	i	did	.	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	.
and	then	i	thought	--	in	my	40s	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	,	why	do	n't	i	do	 some 	 thing 	 	?
i	 al 	 ways 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	,	so	why	do	n't	i	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	the	content	of	my	 cartoon 	 s 	 	to	make	people	think	about	the	stupid	 rule 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 follow 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	laugh	?	``
now	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	is	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	--	--	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	is	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	american	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
i	ca	n't	help	it	.	i	live	here	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	've	 travel 	 ed 	 	a	lot	,	i	still	think	like	an	american	woman	.
but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 rule 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	are	universal	,	of	course	--	that	each	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	different	 code 	 s 	 	of	behavior	and	dress	and	 tradition 	 s 	 	,	and	each	woman	 ha 	 s 	 	to	deal	with	these	same	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	here	in	the	u.s	.
 con 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	.
women	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	on	the	ground	,	we	know	the	tradition	.
we	have	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 antenna 	 e 	 	.
now	my	work	 late 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	with	 inter 	 national 	 	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	,	which	i	so	enjoy	,	and	it	's	 give 	 n 	 	me	a	 great 	 er 	 	 appreci 	 ation 	 	for	the	power	of	 cartoon 	 s 	 	to	get	at	the	truth	,	to	get	at	the	 issue 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	and	 succinct 	 ly 	 	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	it	can	get	to	the	 view 	 er 	 	through	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	,	but	through	the	heart	.
my	work	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	me	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	with	women	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	from	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	--	 count 	 ries 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	saudi	arabia	,	iran	,	 tur 	 key 	 	,	argentina	,	france	--	and	we	have	 s 	 at 	 	together	and	 laugh 	 ed 	 	and	 talk 	 ed 	 	and	 share 	 d 	 	our	 difficult 	 ies 	 	.
and	these	women	are	 work 	 ing 	 	so	hard	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	heard	in	some	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
but	i	feel	 bless 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	work	with	them	.
and	we	talk	about	how	women	have	 s 	 uch 	 	strong	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	 ten 	 uous 	 	position	and	our	role	 a 	 s 	 	tradition	-	 keeper 	 s 	 	,	that	we	can	have	the	great	potential	to	be	change	-	 agent 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	,	i	 tru 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	,	that	we	can	change	 th 	 is 	 	thing	one	laugh	at	a	time	.
thank	you	.
