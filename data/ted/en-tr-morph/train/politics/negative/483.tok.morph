so	,	here	we	go	:	a	 fly 	 by 	 	of	play	.
it	's	got	to	be	serious	if	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 put 	 s 	 	a	cover	story	of	 the 	 ir 	 	february	17th	sunday	magazine	about	play	.
at	the	bottom	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	it	's	 deep 	 er 	 	than	gender	.
 serious 	 ly 	 	,	but	 danger 	 ously 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.
and	a	 sand 	 box 	 	for	new	 idea 	 s 	 	about	evolution	.	``
not	bad	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	if	you	look	at	that	cover	,	what	's	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	?
you	see	any	 adult 	 s 	 	?
well	,	lets	go	back	to	the	15th	century	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 court 	 yard 	 	in	europe	,	and	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	124	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	play	.
all	 age 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 olo 	 	play	,	body	play	,	 game 	 s 	 	,	 taunt 	 ing 	 	.
and	there	it	is	.	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	typical	picture	of	what	it	was	like	in	a	 court 	 yard 	 	then	.
i	think	we	may	have	lost	 some 	 thing 	 	in	our	culture	.
so	i	'm	gon	na	take	you	through	what	i	think	is	a	 remark 	 able 	 	sequence	.
north	of	churchill	,	manitoba	,	in	october	and	november	,	there	's	no	ice	on	hudson	 ba 	 y 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	polar	bear	that	you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	1200	-	pound	male	,	he	's	wild	and	 fair 	 ly 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
and	norbert	rosing	,	a	german	 photograph 	 er 	 	,	is	there	on	scene	,	making	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 photo 	 s 	 	of	these	 husk 	 ies 	 	,	who	are	 tether 	 ed 	 	.
and	from	out	of	stage	left	 come 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	wild	,	male	polar	bear	,	with	a	 predator 	 y 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	.
any	of	you	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	africa	or	had	a	 junk 	 yard 	 	dog	come	after	you	,	there	is	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	kind	of	 predator 	 y 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	that	you	know	you	're	in	trouble	.
but	on	the	other	side	of	that	 predator 	 y 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	is	a	female	 husk 	 y 	 	in	a	play	bow	,	 wagg 	 ing 	 	her	tail	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
that	 fix 	 ed 	 	behavior	--	which	is	rigid	and	 stereo 	 type 	 d 	 	and	 end 	 s 	 	up	with	a	meal	--	 change 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	polar	bear	 stand 	 s 	 	over	the	 husk 	 y 	 	,	no	 claw 	 s 	 	 extend 	 ed 	 	,	no	 fang 	 s 	 	taking	a	look	.
and	they	begin	an	 in 	 credible 	 	ballet	.
a	play	ballet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	nature	:	it	 over 	 ride 	 s 	 	a	 car 	 ni 	 vor 	 ous 	 	nature	and	what	 other 	 wise 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	short	fight	to	the	death	.
and	if	you	'll	begin	to	look	 close 	 ly 	 	at	the	 husk 	 y 	 	that	's	 bear 	 ing 	 	her	throat	to	the	polar	bear	,	and	look	a	little	more	 close 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	in	an	 alter 	 ed 	 	state	.
they	're	in	a	state	of	play	.
and	it	's	that	state	that	 allow 	 s 	 	these	two	 creature 	 s 	 	to	explore	the	possible	.
they	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 n 	 either 	 	would	have	 d 	 one 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	play	 signal 	 s 	 	.
and	it	is	a	 marvel 	 ous 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	a	 different 	 ial 	 	in	power	can	be	 over 	 ridden 	 	by	a	process	of	nature	that	's	 with 	 in 	 	all	of	us	.
now	how	did	i	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	?
john	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	that	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	some	work	with	 murder 	 ers 	 	,	and	i	have	.
the	texas	tower	 murder 	 er 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	,	in	retrospect	,	when	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	his	tragic	mass	murder	,	to	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	play	,	in	that	that	individual	,	by	deep	 stud 	 y 	 	,	was	found	to	have	severe	play	 depriv 	 ation 	 	.
charles	whitman	was	his	name	.
and	our	 commit 	 tee 	 	,	which	 consist 	 ed 	 	of	a	lot	of	hard	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	did	feel	at	the	end	of	that	 stud 	 y 	 	that	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	play	and	a	 progress 	 ive 	 	 suppress 	 ion 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 ally 	 	normal	play	led	him	to	be	more	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	that	he	 perpet 	 rated 	 	.
and	that	 find 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	stood	the	test	of	time	--	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	even	 in 	 to 	 	more	 re 	 cent 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	at	virginia	tech	.
and	other	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 population 	 s 	 	at	risk	sensitized	me	to	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	play	,	but	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	what	it	was	.
and	it	was	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	in	taking	play	 histo 	 ries 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	before	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	full	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	it	.
and	i	do	n't	think	any	of	us	 ha 	 s 	 	a	full	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	it	,	by	any	 mean 	 s 	 	.
but	there	are	ways	of	looking	at	it	that	i	think	can	give	you	--	give	us	all	a	 tax 	 o 	 nomy 	 	,	a	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	image	is	,	for	 human 	 s 	 	,	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	point	of	play	.
when	that	mother	and	infant	lock	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	the	infant	's	old	 en 	 ough 	 	to	have	a	social	 s 	 mile 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	--	 spontane 	 ously 	 	--	is	the	 erupt 	 ion 	 	of	joy	on	the	part	of	the	mother	.
and	she	 begin 	 s 	 	to	 ba 	 bble 	 	and	coo	and	 s 	 mile 	 	,	and	so	 do 	 es 	 	the	baby	.
if	we	've	got	them	wired	up	with	an	 electro 	 encephalo 	 gram 	 	,	the	right	brain	of	each	of	them	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 at 	 tuned 	 	,	so	that	the	 joy 	 ful 	 	emergence	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ear 	 liest 	 	of	play	 scene 	 s 	 	and	the	physiology	of	that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	get	a	handle	on	.
and	i	'd	like	you	to	think	that	every	bit	of	more	complex	play	 build 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	base	for	us	 human 	 s 	 	.
and	so	now	i	'm	going	to	take	you	through	sort	of	a	way	of	looking	at	play	,	but	it	's	never	just	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ly 	 	one	thing	.
we	're	going	to	look	at	body	play	,	which	is	a	 spontane 	 ous 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	to	get	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	out	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	mountain	goat	.
if	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	bad	day	,	try	 th 	 is 	 	:	jump	up	and	down	,	 wig 	 gle 	 	around	--	you	're	going	to	feel	better	.
and	you	may	feel	like	 th 	 is 	 	character	,	who	is	 al 	 so 	 	just	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	 it 	 s 	 	own	sake	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	 part 	 icular 	 	purpose	,	and	that	's	what	's	great	about	play	.
if	 it 	 s 	 	purpose	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	the	act	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	play	.
and	there	's	a	whole	other	type	of	play	,	which	is	object	play	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	japanese	 maca 	 que 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	 snow 	 ball 	 	,	and	he	or	she	's	going	to	roll	down	a	hill	.
and	--	they	do	n't	throw	it	at	each	other	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fundamental	part	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 play 	 ful 	 	.
the	human	hand	,	in	 manipul 	 ation 	 	of	 object 	 s 	 	,	is	the	hand	in	search	of	a	brain	;	the	brain	is	in	search	of	a	hand	;	and	play	is	the	medium	by	which	 t 	 hose 	 	two	are	linked	in	the	best	way	.
jpl	we	heard	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	jpl	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	place	.
they	have	 locate 	 d 	 	two	 consult 	 ants 	 	,	frank	wilson	and	nate	johnson	,	who	are	--	frank	wilson	is	a	 neuro 	 logist 	 	,	nate	johnson	is	a	mechanic	.
he	taught	 mechanic 	 s 	 	in	a	high	school	in	long	beach	,	and	found	that	his	 student 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	able	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	why	.	and	he	came	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	on	his	own	,	that	the	 student 	 s 	 	who	could	no	 long 	 er 	 	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 fix 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	had	n't	 work 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
frank	wilson	had	written	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	hand	.	``
they	got	together	--	jpl	 hire 	 d 	 	them	.
now	jpl	,	nasa	and	boeing	,	before	they	will	hire	a	research	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	problem	 solve 	 r 	 	--	even	if	they	're	 summ 	 a 	 	cum	 la 	 ude 	 	from	harvard	or	cal	tech	--	if	they	have	n't	 fix 	 ed 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	have	n't	 d 	 one 	 	stuff	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	early	in	life	,	 play 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	they	ca	n't	problem	-	solve	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	play	is	practical	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
now	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	about	play	is	that	it	is	born	by	curiosity	and	exploration	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	safe	exploration	.
 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	ok	--	he	's	an	 an 	 atomic 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	little	boy	and	that	's	his	mom	.	other	 situ 	 ations 	 	would	n't	be	 quit 	 e 	 	so	good	.
but	curiosity	,	exploration	,	are	part	of	the	play	scene	.
if	you	want	to	belong	,	you	need	social	play	.
and	social	play	is	part	of	what	we	're	about	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	is	a	 by 	 product 	 	of	the	play	scene	.
rough	and	tumble	play	.
these	 lion 	 es 	 s 	 es 	 	,	 s 	 een 	 	from	a	distance	,	 look 	 ed 	 	like	they	 we 	 re 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	.
but	if	you	look	 close 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	kind	of	like	the	polar	bear	and	 husk 	 y 	 	:	no	 claw 	 s 	 	,	flat	fur	,	soft	 eye 	 s 	 	,	open	mouth	with	no	 fang 	 s 	 	,	 ballet 	 ic 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	,	 curv 	 i 	 linear 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	--	all	specific	to	play	.
and	rough	-	and	-	tumble	play	is	a	great	 learn 	 ing 	 	medium	for	all	of	us	.
 pre 	 school 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	should	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	 d 	 ive 	 	,	hit	,	 whistl 	 e 	 	,	 s 	 cream 	 	,	be	chaotic	,	and	develop	through	that	a	lot	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	and	a	lot	of	the	other	social	 by 	 product 	 s 	 	--	cognitive	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	and	physical	--	that	come	 a 	 s 	 	a	part	of	rough	and	tumble	play	.
 spect 	 ator 	 	play	,	ritual	play	--	we	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	some	of	that	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	from	boston	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	moment	--	rare	--	where	the	red	sox	won	the	world	 s 	 eries 	 	.
but	take	a	look	at	the	face	and	the	body	language	of	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 fuzz 	 y 	 	picture	,	and	you	can	get	a	sense	that	they	're	all	at	play	.
 imagin 	 ative 	 	play	.
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 be 	 cause 	 	my	daughter	,	who	's	now	 al 	 most 	 	40	,	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	but	it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	her	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	and	her	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	her	ability	to	spin	 yarn 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	age	--	 pre 	 school 	 	.
a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	player	is	 imagin 	 ative 	 	 s 	 olo 	 	play	.
and	i	love	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	what	we	're	about	.
we	all	have	an	internal	narrative	that	's	our	own	inner	story	.
the	unit	of	 intellig 	 ibility 	 	of	most	of	our	 brain 	 s 	 	is	the	story	.
i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	a	story	 to 	 day 	 	about	play	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	 bush 	 man 	 	,	i	think	,	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	fish	that	got	away	that	was	that	long	,	but	it	's	a	fundamental	part	of	the	play	scene	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	play	do	for	the	brain	?
well	,	a	lot	.
we	do	n't	know	a	whole	lot	about	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	for	the	human	brain	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	heavy	for	research	on	play	.
i	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	carnegie	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	a	grant	.
they	'd	 give 	 n 	 	me	a	large	grant	when	i	was	an	 academic 	 ian 	 	for	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 felon 	 y 	 	 drunk 	 en 	 	 driver 	 s 	 	,	and	i	thought	i	had	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	track	record	,	and	by	the	time	i	had	 s 	 pent 	 	half	an	hour	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	play	,	it	was	obvious	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	--	did	not	feel	that	play	was	serious	.
i	think	that	--	that	's	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	back	--	i	think	that	wave	is	past	,	and	the	play	wave	is	 crest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	some	good	science	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	 light 	 s 	 	up	the	brain	like	play	.
three	-	dimensional	play	 fire 	 s 	 	up	the	 ce 	 rebel 	 lum 	 	,	 put 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 impulse 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	frontal	lobe	--	the	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	--	 help 	 s 	 	contextual	 memor 	 y 	 	be	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	and	--	and	,	and	,	and	.
so	it	's	--	for	me	,	 it 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 nourish 	 ing 	 	 scholar 	 ly 	 	adventure	to	look	at	the	 neuro 	 science 	 	that	's	 associate 	 d 	 	with	play	,	and	to	 br 	 ing 	 	together	people	who	in	 the 	 ir 	 	individual	 discipline 	 s 	 	had	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	of	it	that	way	.
and	that	's	part	of	what	the	national	institute	for	play	is	all	about	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	ways	you	can	 stud 	 y 	 	play	--	is	to	get	a	256	-	lead	 electro 	 encephalo 	 gram 	 	.
i	'm	sorry	i	do	n't	have	a	 play 	 ful 	 	-	looking	subject	,	but	it	 allow 	 s 	 	 mobil 	 ity 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	the	actual	 stud 	 y 	 	of	play	.
and	we	've	got	a	mother	-	infant	play	scenario	that	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	complete	 under 	 way 	 	at	the	moment	.
the	reason	i	put	 th 	 is 	 	here	is	 al 	 so 	 	to	queue	up	my	 thought 	 s 	 	about	 object 	 ifying 	 	what	play	 do 	 es 	 	.
the	animal	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 object 	 ified 	 	it	.
in	the	animal	world	,	if	you	take	 rat 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 hard 	 wired 	 	to	play	at	a	certain	period	of	 the 	 ir 	 	juvenile	 year 	 s 	 	and	you	suppress	play	--	they	squeak	,	they	 wrestl 	 e 	 	,	they	pin	each	other	,	that	's	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	play	.
if	you	stop	that	behavior	on	one	group	that	you	're	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	,	and	you	allow	it	in	 an 	 other 	 	group	that	you	're	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	,	and	then	you	present	 t 	 hose 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	with	a	cat	odor	-	 saturate 	 d 	 	collar	,	they	're	 hard 	 wired 	 	to	flee	and	hide	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	smart	--	they	do	n't	want	to	get	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	a	cat	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
they	both	hide	out	.
the	non	-	 player 	 s 	 	never	come	out	--	they	die	.
the	 player 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	explore	the	environment	,	and	begin	 aga 	 in 	 	to	test	 thing 	 s 	 	out	.
that	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	 rat 	 s 	 	--	and	i	think	they	have	the	same	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 s 	 	that	we	do	and	a	similar	 cort 	 ical 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	--	that	play	may	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	our	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
and	,	and	,	and	--	there	are	a	lot	more	animal	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	i	could	talk	about	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	play	 depriv 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	took	a	long	time	--	i	had	to	get	homer	down	and	put	him	through	the	fmri	and	the	spect	and	 multi 	 ple 	 	eegs	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	couch	potato	,	his	brain	 ha 	 s 	 	shrunk	.
and	we	do	know	that	in	domestic	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	when	they	're	play	 depriv 	 ed 	 	,	they	do	n't	--	and	 rat 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	--	they	do	n't	develop	a	brain	that	is	normal	.
now	,	the	program	 say 	 s 	 	that	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	play	is	not	work	,	it	's	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	think	if	you	think	about	life	 with 	 out 	 	play	--	no	humor	,	no	 flirt 	 ation 	 	,	no	 movie 	 s 	 	,	no	 game 	 s 	 	,	no	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	and	,	and	,	and	.
try	and	imagine	a	culture	or	a	life	,	adult	or	 other 	 wise 	 	and	the	thing	that	's	so	 un 	 ique 	 	about	our	species	is	that	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	designed	to	play	through	our	whole	 life 	 time 	 	.
and	we	all	have	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	play	signal	.
 no 	 body 	 	 mis 	 s 	 es 	 	that	dog	i	took	a	picture	of	on	a	carmel	beach	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
what	's	going	to	follow	from	that	behavior	is	play	.
and	you	can	trust	it	.
the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	human	trust	is	 establish 	 ed 	 	through	play	 signal 	 s 	 	.
and	we	begin	to	lose	 t 	 hose 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	,	 cultural 	 ly 	 	and	 other 	 wise 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	shame	.
i	think	we	've	got	a	lot	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
now	,	jane	goodall	 ha 	 s 	 	here	a	play	face	 a 	 long 	 	with	one	of	her	 favor 	 ite 	 	 chimp 	 s 	 	.
so	part	of	the	 signal 	 ing 	 	system	of	play	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	vocal	,	 fa 	 cial 	 	,	body	,	 gest 	 ural 	 	.
you	know	,	you	can	tell	--	and	i	think	when	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	play	,	 it 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 group 	 s 	 	to	gain	a	sense	of	 safe 	 ty 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	own	sharing	of	play	 signal 	 s 	 	.
you	may	not	know	 th 	 is 	 	word	,	but	it	should	be	your	 bio 	 logical 	 	first	name	and	last	name	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 neoten 	 y 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	the	 re 	 tent 	 ion 	 	of	 im 	 mature 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 adult 	 hood 	 	.
and	we	are	,	by	physical	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	,	by	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	the	most	 neoten 	 ous 	 	,	the	most	 youth 	 ful 	 	,	the	most	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	the	most	plastic	of	all	 creature 	 s 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	the	most	 play 	 ful 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	leg	up	on	 adapt 	 ability 	 	.
now	,	there	is	a	way	of	looking	at	play	that	i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	here	,	which	is	the	play	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
your	own	personal	play	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	 un 	 ique 	 	,	and	often	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	we	think	about	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	book	written	by	a	 consum 	 mate 	 	player	by	the	name	of	kevin	carroll	.
kevin	carroll	came	from	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 depriv 	 ed 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	:	 alcohol 	 ic 	 	mother	,	absent	father	,	inner	-	city	philadelphia	,	black	,	had	to	take	care	of	a	 young 	 er 	 	brother	.
found	that	when	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	a	 play 	 ground 	 	out	of	a	window	 in 	 to 	 	which	he	had	 be 	 en 	 	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	,	he	felt	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
and	so	he	 follow 	 ed 	 	up	on	it	.
and	his	life	--	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	his	life	from	 depriv 	 ation 	 	and	what	one	would	expect	--	 potential 	 ly 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	or	death	--	he	 be 	 come 	 	a	linguist	,	a	 train 	 er 	 	for	the	76ers	and	now	is	a	 motiv 	 ation 	 al 	 	speaker	.
and	he	 give 	 s 	 	play	 a 	 s 	 	a	 transform 	 ative 	 	force	over	his	entire	life	.
now	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	play	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	i	think	is	a	work	in	progress	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	remember	al	gore	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	first	term	and	then	 dur 	 ing 	 	his	 success 	 ful 	 	but	 un 	 elect 	 ed 	 	run	for	the	 pre 	 side 	 ncy 	 	,	may	remember	him	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	kind	of	 wood 	 en 	 	and	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	his	own	person	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	public	.
and	looking	at	his	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	which	is	common	in	the	press	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	--	looking	at	it	from	a	shrink	's	point	of	view	--	that	a	lot	of	his	life	was	 programm 	 ed 	 	.
 summer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	hard	,	hard	work	,	in	the	heat	of	tennessee	 summer 	 s 	 	.
he	had	the	 expect 	 ations 	 	of	his	 senator 	 ial 	 	father	and	washington	,	d.c	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	think	he	 certain 	 ly 	 	had	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	play	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	--	he	was	n't	 a 	 s 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	,	i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	now	is	by	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	what	is	his	own	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	his	own	inner	drive	,	which	i	think	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	in	all	of	us	in	our	play	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
so	what	i	would	 encourag 	 e 	 	on	an	individual	level	to	do	,	is	to	explore	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	go	to	the	most	clear	,	 joy 	 ful 	 	,	 play 	 ful 	 	image	that	you	have	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	with	a	 to 	 y 	 	,	on	a	 birth 	 day 	 	or	on	a	 vac 	 ation 	 	.
and	begin	to	build	to	build	from	the	emotion	of	that	 in 	 to 	 	how	that	 connect 	 s 	 	with	your	life	now	.
and	you	'll	find	,	you	may	change	 job 	 s 	 	--	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	a	number	people	when	i	've	had	them	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	in	order	to	be	more	 empower 	 ed 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	play	.
or	you	'll	be	able	to	enrich	your	life	by	 priori 	 tizing 	 	it	and	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	it	.
most	of	us	work	with	 group 	 s 	 	,	and	i	put	 th 	 is 	 	up	 be 	 cause 	 	the	d.	school	,	the	design	school	at	stanford	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	david	kelley	and	a	lot	of	 other 	 s 	 	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 vision 	 ary 	 	about	 it 	 s 	 	 establish 	 ment 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	a	group	of	us	to	get	together	and	create	a	course	 call 	 ed 	 	``	from	play	to	 innov 	 ation 	 	.	``
and	you	'll	see	 th 	 is 	 	course	is	to	investigate	the	human	state	of	play	,	which	is	kind	of	like	the	polar	bear	-	 husk 	 y 	 	state	and	 it 	 s 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	to	creative	 think 	 ing 	 	:	``	to	explore	play	behavior	,	 it 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	;	to	 app 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	,	through	design	 think 	 ing 	 	,	to	promote	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	the	corporate	world	;	and	the	 student 	 s 	 	will	work	with	real	-	world	 partner 	 s 	 	on	design	 project 	 s 	 	with	 wide 	 spread 	 	application	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	maiden	voyage	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	're	about	two	and	a	half	,	three	 month 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.
there	is	our	star	pupil	,	 th 	 is 	 	 lab 	 r 	 ador 	 	,	who	taught	a	lot	of	us	what	a	state	of	play	is	,	and	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	aged	and	 decr 	 epit 	 	professor	in	charge	there	.
and	brendan	boyle	,	rich	crandall	--	and	on	the	far	right	is	,	i	think	,	a	person	who	will	be	in	 ca 	 hoots 	 	with	george	smoot	for	a	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	--	stuart	thompson	,	in	 neuro 	 science 	 	.
so	we	've	had	brendan	,	who	's	from	ideo	,	and	the	rest	of	us	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 a 	 side 	 	and	 watch 	 ing 	 	these	 student 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	put	play	 principle 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	practice	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
and	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 project 	 s 	 	was	to	see	what	 make 	 s 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	and	to	try	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
so	what	will	follow	is	a	student	-	made	film	about	just	that	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	flow	is	the	mental	state	of	 appar 	 ition 	 	in	which	the	person	is	fully	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	what	he	or	she	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 character 	 ized 	 	by	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 energ 	 ized 	 	focus	,	full	 involve 	 ment 	 	and	success	in	the	process	of	the	activity	.
an	 import 	 ant 	 	key	 in 	 sight 	 	that	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	is	that	people	pack	them	in	one	after	 an 	 other 	 	,	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	to	the	day	.
 attend 	 ees 	 	at	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	do	n't	know	when	they	'll	get	back	to	the	task	that	they	left	at	 the 	 ir 	 	desk	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	that	way	.
some	 s 	 age 	 	and	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	 fur 	 ry 	 	 monk 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	place	 call 	 ed 	 	the	d.	school	designed	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	that	you	can	 liter 	 ally 	 	step	out	of	when	it	's	over	.
take	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	off	,	and	have	peace	of	mind	that	you	can	come	back	to	me	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	need	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	in	your	 close 	 t 	 	.
the	 wear 	 able 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	put	it	on	,	you	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	get	 every 	 thing 	 	you	need	to	have	a	 f 	 un 	 	and	productive	and	 use 	 ful 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
but	when	you	take	it	off	--	that	's	when	the	real	action	 happen 	 s 	 	.
stuart	 brow 	 n 	 	:	so	i	would	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	all	to	engage	not	in	the	work	-	play	 different 	 ial 	 	--	where	you	set	 a 	 side 	 	time	to	play	--	but	where	your	life	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 fused 	 	minute	by	minute	,	hour	by	hour	,	with	body	,	social	,	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	,	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	play	.
and	i	think	you	'll	have	a	better	and	more	 empower 	 ed 	 	life	.
thank	you	.
john	hockenberry	:	so	it	 sound 	 s 	 	to	me	like	what	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	is	that	there	may	be	some	 tempt 	 ation 	 	on	the	part	of	people	to	look	at	your	work	i	think	i	've	heard	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	my	kind	of	pop	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	play	,	that	 some 	 how 	 	,	the	way	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 human 	 s 	 	deal	with	play	,	is	that	it	's	some	sort	of	 rehears 	 al 	 	for	adult	activity	.
your	work	 seem 	 s 	 	to	suggest	that	that	is	 power 	 fully 	 	wrong	.
sb	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	do	n't	think	that	's	accurate	,	and	i	think	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	have	taught	us	that	.
if	you	stop	a	cat	from	 play 	 ing 	 	--	which	you	can	do	,	and	we	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	how	 cat 	 s 	 	bat	around	stuff	--	they	're	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	 predator 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	would	be	if	they	had	n't	 play 	 ed 	 	.
and	if	you	imagine	a	kid	 pretend 	 ing 	 	to	be	king	kong	,	or	a	race	car	driver	,	or	a	 fire 	 man 	 	,	they	do	n't	all	 be 	 come 	 	race	car	 driver 	 s 	 	or	 fire 	 men 	 	,	you	know	.
so	there	's	a	 dis 	 connect 	 	between	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	for	the	future	--	which	is	what	most	people	are	 comfort 	 able 	 	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	play	 a 	 s 	 	--	and	 think 	 ing 	 	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 separat 	 e 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 ent 	 ity 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	my	chasing	 animal 	 s 	 	for	four	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	from	a	 clinic 	 ian 	 	to	what	i	am	now	,	which	is	that	play	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	place	,	just	like	sleep	and	 dream 	 s 	 	do	.
and	if	you	look	at	sleep	and	 dream 	 s 	 	 bio 	 logically 	 	,	 animal 	 s 	 	sleep	and	dream	,	and	they	 rehears 	 e 	 	and	they	do	some	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	help	 memor 	 y 	 	and	that	are	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	sleep	and	 dream 	 s 	 	.
the	next	step	of	evolution	in	 mammal 	 s 	 	and	 creature 	 s 	 	with	 divine 	 ly 	 	 super 	 flu 	 ous 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	will	be	to	play	.
and	the	fact	that	the	polar	bear	and	 husk 	 y 	 	or	magpie	and	a	bear	or	you	and	i	and	our	 dog 	 s 	 	can	 cross 	 over 	 	and	have	that	experience	 set 	 s 	 	play	 a 	 side 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	.
and	 it 	 s 	 	 huge 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	 craft 	 ing 	 	the	brain	.
so	it	's	not	just	 some 	 thing 	 	you	do	in	your	spare	time	.
jh	:	how	do	you	keep	--	and	i	know	you	're	part	of	the	scientific	research	community	,	and	you	have	to	 just 	 ify 	 	your	 exist 	 ence 	 	with	 grant 	 s 	 	and	 proposal 	 s 	 	like	 every 	 one 	 	else	--	how	do	you	prevent	--	and	some	of	the	data	that	you	've	 produce 	 d 	 	,	the	good	science	that	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	you	've	 produce 	 d 	 	,	is	hot	to	handle	.
how	do	you	prevent	either	the	media	's	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	your	work	or	the	scientific	community	's	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	your	work	,	kind	of	like	the	mozart	metaphor	,	where	,	``	oh	,	mris	show	that	play	 enhance 	 s 	 	your	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
well	,	let	's	round	these	 kid 	 s 	 	up	,	put	them	in	 pen 	 s 	 	and	make	them	play	for	 month 	 s 	 	at	a	time	;	they	'll	all	be	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	and	go	to	harvard	.	``
how	do	you	prevent	people	from	taking	that	sort	of	action	on	the	data	that	you	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	?
sb	:	well	,	i	think	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	i	know	to	do	it	is	to	have	 accumul 	 ated 	 	the	 advise 	 rs 	 	that	i	have	who	go	from	 practitioner 	 s 	 	--	who	can	establish	through	 improvisation 	 al 	 	play	or	 clown 	 ing 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	--	a	state	of	play	.
so	people	know	that	it	's	there	.
and	then	you	get	an	fmri	 special 	 ist 	 	,	and	you	get	frank	wilson	,	and	you	get	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	hard	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 neuro 	 endo 	 cri 	 no 	 logists 	 	.
and	you	get	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	group	together	focused	on	play	,	and	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	not	to	take	it	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	for	the	national	science	 found 	 ation 	 	,	national	institute	of	mental	health	or	 any 	 body 	 	else	to	 re 	 ally 	 	look	at	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
i	mean	you	do	n't	hear	about	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	like	cancer	or	heart	disease	 associate 	 d 	 	with	play	.
and	yet	i	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	just	 a 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	for	 surviv 	 al 	 	--	long	term	--	 a 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	public	health	.
jh	:	stuart	 brow 	 n 	 	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
