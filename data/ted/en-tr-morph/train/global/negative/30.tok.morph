once	 up 	 on 	 	a	time	,	there	was	a	dread	disease	that	 affli 	 cted 	 	children	.
and	in	fact	,	among	all	the	 disease 	 s 	 	that	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	land	,	it	was	the	worst	.	it	 kill 	 ed 	 	the	most	children	.
and	 a 	 long 	 	came	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	inventor	,	a	scientist	,	who	came	up	with	a	partial	cure	for	that	disease	.
and	it	was	n't	perfect	.	 man 	 y 	 	children	still	 di 	 ed 	 	,	but	it	was	 certain 	 ly 	 	better	than	what	they	had	before	.
and	one	of	the	good	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	cure	was	that	it	was	free	,	 virtual 	 ly 	 	free	,	and	was	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	use	.
but	the	worst	thing	about	it	was	that	you	could	n't	use	it	on	the	 young 	 est 	 	children	,	on	 infant 	 s 	 	,	and	on	one	-	year	-	olds	.
and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	scientist	--	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	scientist	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	one	who	had	 precede 	 d 	 	him	,	but	building	on	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	first	one	--	came	up	with	a	second	cure	.
and	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	the	second	cure	for	 th 	 is 	 	disease	was	that	it	could	be	used	on	 infant 	 s 	 	and	one	-	year	-	olds	.
and	the	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	cure	was	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	,	and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	to	use	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	hard	 a 	 s 	 	they	could	to	use	it	 proper 	 ly 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	them	 end 	 ed 	 	up	using	it	wrong	in	the	end	.
but	what	they	did	,	of	course	,	since	it	was	so	 complic 	 ated 	 	and	expensive	,	they	 on 	 ly 	 	used	it	on	the	zero	-	year	-	olds	and	the	one	-	year	-	olds	.
and	they	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	using	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	cure	that	they	had	on	the	two	-	year	-	olds	and	up	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	went	on	for	 quit 	 e 	 	some	time	.	people	 we 	 re 	 	happy	.
they	had	 the 	 ir 	 	two	 cure 	 s 	 	.	 un 	 til 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	mother	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	child	had	just	 turn 	 ed 	 	two	,	 di 	 ed 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	disease	.
and	she	thought	to	 her 	 self 	 	,	``	my	child	just	 turn 	 ed 	 	two	,	and	 un 	 til 	 	the	child	 turn 	 ed 	 	two	,	i	had	 al 	 ways 	 	used	 th 	 is 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	expensive	cure	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
and	then	the	child	 turn 	 ed 	 	two	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	using	the	cheap	and	easy	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	and	i	wonder	``	--	and	she	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	like	all	 parent 	 s 	 	who	lose	children	wonder	--	``	if	there	is	n't	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	could	have	 d 	 one 	 	,	like	keep	on	using	that	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	expensive	cure	.	``
and	she	told	all	the	other	people	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	could	it	possibly	be	that	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	cheap	and	simple	 work 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 complic 	 ated 	 	and	expensive	?	``
and	the	people	thought	,	``	you	know	,	you	're	right	.
it	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	the	wrong	thing	to	do	to	 s 	 witch 	 	and	use	the	cheap	and	simple	solution	.	``
and	the	government	,	they	heard	her	story	and	the	other	people	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	're	right	,	we	should	make	a	law	.
we	should	 out 	 law 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cheap	and	simple	 treat 	 ment 	 	and	not	let	 any 	 body 	 	use	 th 	 is 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.	``
and	the	people	 we 	 re 	 	happy	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	satisfied	.
for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	went	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	was	fine	.
but	then	 a 	 long 	 	came	a	 low 	 ly 	 	economist	,	who	had	children	 him 	 self 	 	,	and	he	used	the	expensive	and	 complic 	 ated 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
but	he	 k 	 new 	 	about	the	cheap	and	simple	one	.
and	he	thought	about	it	,	and	the	expensive	one	did	n't	seem	that	great	to	him	.	so	he	thought	,	``	i	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	science	,	but	i	do	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	data	,	so	 may 	 be 	 	i	should	go	and	look	at	the	data	and	see	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	expensive	and	 complic 	 ated 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	any	better	than	the	cheap	and	simple	one	.	``
and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	when	he	went	through	the	data	,	he	found	that	it	did	n't	look	like	the	expensive	,	 complic 	 ated 	 	solution	was	any	better	than	the	cheap	one	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	the	children	who	 we 	 re 	 	two	and	 old 	 er 	 	--	the	cheap	one	still	did	n't	work	on	the	 kid 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 young 	 er 	 	.
and	so	,	he	went	forth	to	the	people	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	made	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	:	it	 look 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	could	just	use	the	cheap	and	simple	solution	,	and	by	 do 	 ing 	 	so	we	could	 s 	 ave 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	300	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	,	and	we	could	 s 	 pend 	 	that	on	our	children	in	other	ways	.	``
and	the	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	how	can	the	cheap	and	easy	thing	be	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	hard	thing	?	``	and	the	government	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	people	who	made	 th 	 is 	 	expensive	solution	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	thought	,	``	how	can	we	hope	to	compete	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	free	?
we	would	lose	all	of	our	market	.	``
and	people	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	and	they	 call 	 ed 	 	him	 horr 	 ible 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	he	should	 leav 	 e 	 	the	country	for	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	seek	out	some	more	intelligent	,	open	-	minded	people	in	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	oxford	,	and	come	and	try	and	tell	the	story	at	that	place	.
and	so	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	here	i	am	.	it	's	not	a	 fair 	 y 	 	tale	.
it	's	a	true	story	about	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	the	disease	i	'm	 refer 	 ring 	 	to	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	motor	vehicle	 accident 	 s 	 	for	children	.
and	the	free	cure	is	adult	 seat 	 belt 	 s 	 	,	and	the	expensive	cure	--	the	300	-	million	-	dollar	-	a	-	year	cure	--	is	child	car	 seat 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	some	of	the	evidence	why	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	true	:	that	for	children	two	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	up	,	there	 re 	 ally 	 	is	no	real	benefit	--	proven	benefit	--	of	car	 seat 	 s 	 	,	in	spite	of	the	 in 	 credible 	 	energy	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 devote 	 d 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 expand 	 ing 	 	the	 law 	 s 	 	and	making	it	 social 	 ly 	 	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	to	put	your	children	 in 	 to 	 	 seat 	 belt 	 s 	 	.	and	then	talk	about	why	--	what	is	it	that	 make 	 s 	 	that	true	?
and	then	,	 final 	 ly 	 	talk	a	little	bit	about	a	third	way	,	about	 an 	 other 	 	technology	,	which	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	better	than	 any 	 thing 	 	we	have	,	but	which	--	there	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	any	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	for	 adopt 	 ion 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	are	so	 ena 	 mor 	 ed 	 	with	the	current	car	seat	solution	.	ok	.
so	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	when	you	try	to	do	research	on	data	,	it	 record 	 s 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	--	it	's	hard	to	find	in	the	data	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	turn	out	to	be	the	case	when	you	look	at	 seat 	 belt 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	car	 seat 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 keep 	 s 	 	a	data	set	of	every	fatal	accident	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	since	1975	.
so	in	every	car	crash	in	which	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	person	dies	,	they	have	information	on	all	of	the	people	.
so	if	you	look	at	that	data	--	it	's	right	up	on	the	national	 high 	 way 	 	 transport 	 ation 	 	 safe 	 ty 	 	 administr 	 ation 	 	's	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	--	you	can	just	look	at	the	raw	data	,	and	begin	to	get	a	sense	of	the	 limit 	 ed 	 	amount	of	evidence	that	's	in	favor	of	car	 seat 	 s 	 	for	children	aged	two	and	up	.
so	,	here	is	the	data	.	here	i	have	,	among	two	-	to	six	-	year	-	olds	--	 any 	 one 	 	above	six	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	no	one	uses	car	 seat 	 s 	 	,	so	you	ca	n't	 compar 	 e 	 	--	29.3	percent	of	the	children	who	are	 un 	 re 	 s 	 trained 	 	in	a	crash	in	which	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	person	dies	,	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	die	.
if	you	put	a	child	in	a	car	seat	,	18.2	percent	of	the	children	die	.
if	they	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	lap	-	and	-	shoulder	belt	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	raw	data	,	19.4	percent	die	.	and	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	lap	-	 on 	 ly 	 	 seat 	 belt 	 	,	16.7	percent	die	.	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 theor 	 y 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	the	lap	-	 on 	 ly 	 	 seat 	 belt 	 	's	got	to	be	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	the	lap	-	and	-	shoulder	belt	.	and	that	just	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	you	that	when	you	deal	with	raw	data	,	there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 found 	 ing 	 	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	that	may	be	 get 	 ting 	 	in	the	way	.
so	what	we	do	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	is	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 present 	 ing 	 	the	same	information	,	but	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	figure	to	make	it	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
so	the	yellow	bar	 represent 	 s 	 	car	 seat 	 s 	 	,	the	 o 	 range 	 	bar	lap	-	and	-	shoulder	,	and	the	red	bar	lap	-	 on 	 ly 	 	 seat 	 belt 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	 un 	 re 	 s 	 trained 	 	--	the	 big 	 ger 	 	the	bar	,	the	better	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	data	i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	,	ok	?
so	the	highest	bar	is	what	you	're	 striv 	 ing 	 	to	beat	.
so	you	can	control	for	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	how	hard	the	crash	was	,	what	seat	the	child	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	,	etc	.	,	the	age	of	the	child	.
and	that	's	that	middle	set	of	 bar 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	you	can	see	that	the	lap	-	 on 	 ly 	 	 seat 	 belt 	 s 	 	start	to	look	 wo 	 rse 	 	once	you	do	that	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	last	set	of	 bar 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 controll 	 ing 	 	for	 every 	 thing 	 	you	could	possibly	imagine	about	the	crash	,	50	,	75	,	100	different	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	the	crash	.
and	what	you	find	is	that	the	car	 seat 	 s 	 	and	the	lap	-	and	-	shoulder	 belt 	 s 	 	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	saving	 live 	 s 	 	,	 fatal 	 ities 	 	look	 exact 	 ly 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	.
and	the	standard	error	 band 	 s 	 	are	 relat 	 ively 	 	small	around	these	 estimate 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	it	's	not	just	 over 	 all 	 	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 ro 	 bust 	 	to	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	to	look	at	.
one	thing	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	:	if	you	look	at	frontal	-	impact	 crash 	 es 	 	--	when	the	car	 crash 	 es 	 	,	the	front	 hit 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	what	you	see	is	that	the	car	 seat 	 s 	 	look	a	little	bit	better	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	just	chance	.
in	order	to	have	the	car	seat	approved	,	you	need	to	pass	certain	federal	 standard 	 s 	 	,	all	of	which	involve	 s 	 lam 	 ming 	 	your	car	 in 	 to 	 	a	direct	frontal	crash	.
but	when	you	look	at	other	 type 	 s 	 	of	 crash 	 es 	 	,	like	rear	-	impact	 crash 	 es 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	car	 seat 	 s 	 	do	n't	perform	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	i	think	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 optimize 	 d 	 	to	pass	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ways 	 	expect	people	to	do	,	to	optimize	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	bright	-	line	 rule 	 s 	 	about	how	 affect 	 ed 	 	the	car	will	be	.
and	the	other	thing	you	might	 argu 	 e 	 	is	,	``	well	,	car	 seat 	 s 	 	have	got	a	lot	better	over	time	.
and	so	if	we	look	at	 re 	 cent 	 	 crash 	 es 	 	--	the	whole	data	set	is	 al 	 most 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	data	--	you	wo	n't	see	it	in	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 crash 	 es 	 	.	the	new	car	 seat 	 s 	 	are	far	,	far	better	.	``
but	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 crash 	 es 	 	the	lap	-	and	-	shoulder	 seat 	 belt 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	are	 do 	 ing 	 	even	better	than	the	car	 seat 	 s 	 	.
they	say	,	``	well	,	that	's	 im 	 possible 	 	,	that	ca	n't	be	.	``
and	the	line	of	argument	,	if	you	ask	 parent 	 s 	 	,	is	,	``	but	car	 seat 	 s 	 	are	so	expensive	and	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	and	they	have	 th 	 is 	 	big	tangle	of	 latch 	 es 	 	,	how	could	they	possibly	not	work	better	than	 seat 	 belt 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	so	expensive	and	 complic 	 ated 	 	?	``
it	's	kind	of	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	logic	,	i	think	,	that	people	use	.	and	the	other	logic	,	they	say	,	``	well	,	the	government	would	n't	have	told	us	[	to	]	use	them	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	much	better	.	``
but	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	the	government	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	to	use	them	is	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	based	on	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	based	on	some	 im 	 pass 	 ion 	 ed 	 	pleas	of	 parent 	 s 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	children	 di 	 ed 	 	after	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	two	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	the	 pass 	 age 	 	of	all	these	 law 	 s 	 	--	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	on	data	.
so	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	get	so	far	,	i	think	,	in	 tell 	 ing 	 	your	story	by	using	these	abstract	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	had	some	 friend 	 s 	 	over	to	 d 	 inner 	 	,	and	i	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	--	we	had	a	 cook 	 out 	 	--	i	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	them	what	 ad 	 vice 	 	they	might	have	for	me	about	 prov 	 ing 	 	my	point	.	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	you	run	some	crash	 test 	 s 	 	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	a	great	idea	.	``
so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	commission	some	crash	 test 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 a 	 s 	 	we	 call 	 ed 	 	around	to	the	 in 	 dependent 	 	crash	test	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	around	the	country	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	our	crash	test	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	some	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	,	some	not	so	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	,	``	all	of	our	business	 come 	 s 	 	from	car	seat	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	.
we	ca	n't	risk	 alien 	 ating 	 	them	by	 test 	 ing 	 	 seat 	 belt 	 s 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	car	 seat 	 s 	 	.	``
now	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	one	did	.	under	the	 condition 	 s 	 	of	 anonym 	 ity 	 	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	would	be	happy	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	test	for	us	--	so	 anonym 	 ity 	 	,	and	1,500	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	seat	that	we	 crash 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	,	we	went	to	buffalo	,	new	york	,	and	here	is	the	 pre 	 cursor 	 	to	it	.
these	are	the	crash	test	 d 	 um 	 mies 	 	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	chance	to	take	the	center	stage	.
and	then	,	here	's	how	the	crash	test	 work 	 s 	 	.
here	,	they	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	crash	the	entire	car	,	you	know	--	it	's	not	worth	 ruin 	 ing 	 	a	whole	car	to	do	it	.
so	they	just	have	these	bench	 seat 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 trap 	 	the	car	seat	and	the	 seat 	 belt 	 	onto	it	.
so	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	you	to	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	good	idea	of	why	 parent 	 s 	 	think	car	 seat 	 s 	 	are	so	great	.	look	at	the	kid	in	the	car	seat	.
 do 	 es 	 	he	not	look	content	,	ready	to	go	,	like	he	could	 surviv 	 e 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	?	and	then	,	if	you	look	at	the	kid	in	back	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	he	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 cho 	 king 	 	before	the	crash	even	 happen 	 s 	 	.
it	's	hard	to	 believ 	 e 	 	,	when	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	that	kid	in	back	is	going	to	do	 ver 	 y 	 	well	when	you	get	in	a	crash	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	crash	where	they	're	going	to	 s 	 lam 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	forward	 in 	 to 	 	a	wall	at	30	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	and	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.	ok	?
so	,	let	me	show	you	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
these	are	three	-	year	-	old	 d 	 um 	 mies 	 	,	by	the	way	.
so	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	car	seat	.	now	watch	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	watch	how	the	head	 go 	 es 	 	forward	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	the	 knee 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	car	seat	--	and	watch	how	the	car	seat	flies	around	,	in	the	 re 	 bound 	 	,	up	in	the	air	.
the	car	seat	's	moving	all	over	the	place	.
bear	in	mind	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	car	seat	that	was	 install 	 ed 	 	by	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 install 	 ed 	 	1,000	car	 seat 	 s 	 	,	who	 k 	 new 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	to	do	it	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	these	bench	 seat 	 s 	 	are	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	way	to	install	car	 seat 	 s 	 	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	a	flat	back	 make 	 s 	 	it	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	install	them	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	test	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 rig 	 ged 	 	in	favor	of	the	car	seat	,	ok	?	so	,	that	kid	in	 th 	 is 	 	crash	 far 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
the	federal	 standard 	 s 	 	are	that	you	have	to	score	 be 	 low 	 	a	1,000	to	be	an	approved	car	seat	on	 th 	 is 	 	crash	,	in	some	metric	of	 unit 	 s 	 	which	are	not	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	crash	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	about	a	450	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	car	seat	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	above	-	average	car	seat	from	consumer	 report 	 s 	 	,	and	did	 quit 	 e 	 	well	.
so	the	next	one	.	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kid	,	same	crash	,	who	is	in	the	 seat 	 belt 	 	.	he	 hard 	 ly 	 	 move 	 s 	 	at	all	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	the	other	child	.	the	funny	thing	is	,	the	cam	work	is	 terr 	 ible 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	 on 	 ly 	 	set	it	up	to	do	the	car	 seat 	 s 	 	,	and	so	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	even	have	a	way	to	move	the	camera	so	you	can	see	the	kid	that	's	on	the	 re 	 bound 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 crash 	 es 	 	,	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	three	-	year	-	old	did	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.	so	,	he	 get 	 s 	 	about	a	500	out	of	--	you	know	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	range	--	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	a	400	and	 some 	 thing 	 	.
but	still	,	if	you	just	took	that	data	from	that	crash	to	the	federal	government	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	new	car	seat	.
i	would	like	you	to	 ap 	 prove 	 	it	for	selling	,	``	then	they	would	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fantastic	new	car	seat	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	great	.
it	 on 	 ly 	 	got	a	500	,	it	could	have	gotten	 a 	 s 	 	high	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	1,000	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	 seat 	 belt 	 	would	have	 pass 	 ed 	 	with	 fly 	 ing 	 	 color 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	approved	 a 	 s 	 	a	car	seat	.
so	,	in	some	sense	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	 suggest 	 ing 	 	is	that	it	's	not	just	that	people	are	setting	up	 the 	 ir 	 	car	 seat 	 s 	 	wrong	,	which	is	 put 	 ting 	 	children	at	risk	.	it	's	just	that	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	the	car	 seat 	 s 	 	are	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	much	.
so	here	's	the	crash	.	so	these	are	 time 	 d 	 	at	the	same	time	,	so	you	can	see	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	much	 long 	 er 	 	with	the	car	seat	--	at	 re 	 bound 	 	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	lot	 long 	 er 	 	--	but	there	's	just	a	lot	less	 move 	 ment 	 	for	child	who	's	in	the	 seat 	 belt 	 	.
so	,	i	'll	show	you	the	six	-	year	-	old	 crash 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	six	-	year	-	old	is	in	a	car	seat	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 look 	 s 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	but	that	's	great	.	that	's	like	a	400	,	ok	?
so	that	kid	would	do	fine	in	the	crash	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	about	that	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 problem 	 atic 	 	to	the	child	at	all	.
and	then	here	's	the	six	-	year	-	old	in	the	 seat 	 belt 	 	,	and	in	fact	,	they	get	 exact 	 ly 	 	 with 	 in 	 	,	you	know	,	 with 	 in 	 	one	or	two	 point 	 s 	 	of	the	same	.	so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	for	the	six	-	year	-	old	,	the	car	seat	did	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
that	's	some	more	evidence	,	so	in	some	sense	--	i	was	 critic 	 ized 	 	by	a	scientist	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	could	never	publish	a	 stud 	 y 	 	with	an	n	of	4	,	``	meaning	 t 	 hose 	 	four	 crash 	 es 	 	.
so	i	wrote	him	back	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	about	an	n	of	45,004	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	the	other	45,000	other	real	-	world	 crash 	 es 	 	.
and	i	just	think	that	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	the	idea	of	using	real	-	world	 crash 	 es 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 economist 	 s 	 	think	would	be	the	right	thing	to	do	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	think	--	they	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	use	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 im 	 perfect 	 	science	of	looking	at	the	 d 	 um 	 mies 	 	,	than	 actual 	 ly 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	of	data	of	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	with	children	and	with	car	 seat 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	think	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	is	that	there	's	a	much	better	solution	out	there	,	that	's	gotten	 no 	 body 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	is	so	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	with	the	way	car	 seat 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	you	think	from	a	design	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	about	going	back	to	square	one	,	and	say	,	``	i	just	want	to	protect	 kid 	 s 	 	in	the	back	seat	.	``
i	do	n't	there	's	 any 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	who	'd	say	,	``	well	,	the	right	way	to	start	would	be	,	let	's	make	a	great	seat	belt	for	 adult 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	let	's	make	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	big	contraption	that	you	have	to	rig	up	to	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	 dai 	 s 	 y 	 	chain	.	``
i	mean	,	why	not	start	--	who	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	back	seat	 any 	 way 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	?
but	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	i	do	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	much	it	would	cost	to	do	,	but	there	's	no	reason	i	could	see	why	 th 	 is 	 	should	be	much	more	expensive	than	a	regular	car	seat	.
it	's	just	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 fold 	 ing 	 	up	--	it	's	 be 	 hind 	 	the	seat	.
you	've	got	a	regular	seat	for	 adult 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	fold	it	down	,	and	the	kid	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	top	,	and	it	's	 integrate 	 d 	 	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	 th 	 is 	 	ca	n't	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	solution	,	and	it	's	got	to	work	better	than	what	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	.
so	the	question	is	,	is	there	any	hope	for	 adopt 	 ion 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	would	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	a	lot	of	 live 	 s 	 	?
and	i	think	the	answer	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	lies	in	a	story	.
the	answer	both	to	why	 ha 	 s 	 	a	car	seat	 be 	 en 	 	so	 success 	 ful 	 	,	and	why	 th 	 is 	 	may	 some 	 day 	 	be	 adopt 	 ed 	 	or	not	,	lies	in	a	story	that	my	dad	told	me	,	 relat 	 ing 	 	to	when	he	was	a	doctor	in	the	u.s.	air	force	in	england	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	long	time	ago	:	you	 we 	 re 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	then	you	ca	n't	do	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	my	father	would	have	 patient 	 s 	 	come	in	who	he	thought	 we 	 re 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	sick	.
and	he	had	a	big	jar	full	of	 place 	 bo 	 	 pill 	 s 	 	that	he	would	give	them	,	and	he	'd	say	,	``	come	back	in	a	week	,	if	you	still	feel	 lous 	 y 	 	.	``
ok	,	and	most	of	them	would	not	come	back	,	but	some	of	them	would	come	back	.
and	when	they	came	back	,	he	,	still	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	sick	,	had	 an 	 other 	 	jar	of	 pill 	 s 	 	.	in	 th 	 is 	 	jar	 we 	 re 	 	huge	horse	 pill 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	swallow	.
and	these	,	to	me	,	are	the	 analog 	 y 	 	for	the	car	 seat 	 s 	 	.
people	would	look	at	these	and	say	,	``	man	,	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	so	big	and	so	hard	to	swallow	.	if	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	me	feel	better	,	you	know	,	what	possibly	could	?	``
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	most	people	would	n't	come	back	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.	but	every	once	in	a	while	,	there	was	still	a	patient	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	he	was	sick	,	and	he	'd	come	back	.	and	my	dad	had	a	third	jar	of	 pill 	 s 	 	.
and	the	jar	of	 pill 	 s 	 	he	had	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	the	 tin 	 iest 	 	little	 pill 	 s 	 	he	could	find	,	so	small	you	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	see	them	.
and	he	would	say	,	listen	,	i	know	i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	that	huge	pill	,	that	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	hard	-	to	-	swallow	pill	before	,	but	now	i	've	got	one	that	's	so	potent	,	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	and	small	and	 al 	 most 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	thing	here	,	which	you	ca	n't	even	see	.	``
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	never	,	in	all	the	 time 	 s 	 	my	dad	 g 	 ave 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	pill	,	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	pill	,	did	 any 	 one 	 	ever	come	back	still	 complain 	 ing 	 	of	 sick 	 ness 	 	.
so	,	my	dad	 al 	 ways 	 	took	that	 a 	 s 	 	evidence	that	 th 	 is 	 	little	,	 teen 	 y 	 	,	 power 	 ful 	 	pill	had	the	ultimate	 place 	 bo 	 	effect	.	and	in	some	sense	,	if	that	's	the	right	story	,	i	think	 integrate 	 d 	 	car	 seat 	 s 	 	you	will	see	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 coming 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	.	the	other	possible	 con 	 clusion 	 	is	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	after	coming	to	my	father	three	 time 	 s 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	home	with	 place 	 bo 	 s 	 	,	he	still	felt	sick	,	he	went	and	found	 an 	 other 	 	doctor	.
and	that	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	possible	.	and	if	that	's	the	case	,	then	i	think	we	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	 convention 	 al 	 	car	 seat 	 s 	 	for	a	long	time	to	come	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
(	audience	:	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	ask	you	,	when	we	wear	 seat 	 belt 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	wear	them	just	to	prevent	loss	of	life	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	to	prevent	 lot 	 s 	 	of	serious	 in 	 jury 	 	.
your	data	 look 	 s 	 	at	 fatal 	 ities 	 	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	at	serious	 in 	 jury 	 	.
is	there	any	data	to	show	that	child	 seat 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	less	effective	,	or	just	 a 	 s 	 	effective	 a 	 s 	 	 seat 	 belt 	 s 	 	for	serious	 in 	 jury 	 	?	 be 	 cause 	 	that	would	prove	your	case	.	)	steven	levitt	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	a	great	question	.	in	my	data	,	and	in	 an 	 other 	 	data	set	i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	for	new	jersey	 crash 	 es 	 	,	i	find	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 in 	 jury 	 	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	data	,	it	's	 statistic 	 ally 	 	 in 	 significant 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 in 	 jury 	 	between	car	 seat 	 s 	 	and	lap	-	and	-	shoulder	 belt 	 s 	 	.
in	the	new	jersey	data	,	which	is	different	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	just	fatal	 crash 	 es 	 	,	but	all	 crash 	 es 	 	in	new	jersey	that	are	 report 	 ed 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	there	is	a	10	percent	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 inju 	 ries 	 	,	but	 general 	 ly 	 	they	're	the	minor	 inju 	 ries 	 	.
now	,	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	i	should	say	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 dis 	 claim 	 er 	 	,	there	is	medical	 liter 	 ature 	 	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	 re 	 solve 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	other	data	,	which	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	car	 seat 	 s 	 	are	 dramat 	 ically 	 	better	.
and	they	use	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 method 	 ology 	 	that	 involve 	 s 	 	--	after	the	crash	 occur 	 s 	 	,	they	get	from	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	crash	,	and	they	call	them	on	the	phone	,	and	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	 re 	 solve 	 	,	yet	,	and	i	'd	like	to	work	with	these	medical	 research 	 ers 	 	to	try	to	understand	how	there	can	be	these	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	at	 odd 	 s 	 	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
but	it	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	critical	question	.
the	question	is	even	if	--	are	there	 en 	 ough 	 	serious	 inju 	 ries 	 	to	make	these	cost	-	effective	?	it	's	kind	of	 trick 	 y 	 	.
even	if	they	're	right	,	it	's	not	so	clear	that	they	're	so	cost	-	effective	.
