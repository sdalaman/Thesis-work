so	,	these	are	the	dark	 age 	 s 	 	.
and	the	dark	 age 	 s 	 	are	the	time	between	when	you	put	away	the	lego	for	the	last	time	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	,	and	you	decide	 a 	 s 	 	an	adult	that	it	is	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	play	with	a	kid	's	 to 	 y 	 	.
 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	my	then	four	-	year	-	old	:	``	oh	,	should	buy	the	kid	some	lego	.
that	stuff	's	cool	.	``
 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	lego	store	.
 b 	 ought 	 	him	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	appropriate	for	a	four	-	year	-	old	.
i	think	the	box	 say 	 s 	 	--	let	's	see	here	--	``	8	to	12	``	on	it	.
i	turn	to	my	wife	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	who	are	we	 buy 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	?	``
she	's	like	,	``	oh	,	us	.	``	i	'm	like	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	all	right	.	that	's	cool	.	``
 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	it	got	a	little	bit	out	of	control	.
the	 din 	 ing 	 	room	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	walk	there	,	and	it	 hurt 	 s 	 	.
so	we	took	a	room	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	used	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	an	abu	ghraib	 an 	 n 	 ex 	 	.
torture	,	 ver 	 y 	 	funny	.
 w 	 ow 	 	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	great	.
and	we	put	down	 t 	 hose 	 	little	floor	 tile 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	went	onto	ebay	and	 b 	 ought 	 	150	 pound 	 s 	 	of	lego	--	which	is	 insan 	 e 	 	.
my	daughter	--	the	day	we	got	it	,	i	was	 tuck 	 ing 	 	her	in	--	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	honey	,	you	're	my	 treasu 	 re 	 	.	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	the	lego	is	the	 treasu 	 re 	 	.	``
and	then	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	dad	,	we	're	lego	rich	.	``
i	was	like	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.
i	suppose	we	are	.	``
so	then	once	you	do	that	you	're	like	,	``	oh	,	crap	.	where	am	i	going	to	put	all	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
so	you	go	to	the	 contain 	 er 	 	store	and	 s 	 pend 	 	an	enormous	amount	of	money	,	and	then	you	start	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	 sort 	 ing 	 	process	that	never	--	it	's	just	nuts	.
 what 	 ever 	 	.
so	then	you	 real 	 ize 	 	there	are	these	 convention 	 s 	 	.
and	you	go	to	one	of	these	 convention 	 s 	 	,	and	some	 du 	 de 	 	built	the	 titan 	 ic 	 	.
and	you	're	like	,	``	holy	shit	!
he	had	to	come	in	like	a	truck	,	a	semi	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.	``
and	then	 some 	 one 	 	built	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	smith	tower	in	seattle	.
just	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	there	's	a	 du 	 de 	 	selling	these	 after 	 market 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	for	lego	,	 be 	 cause 	 	lego	--	the	danish	--	no	,	they	're	not	 in 	 to 	 	 gun 	 s 	 	.
but	the	americans	?	oh	,	we	'll	make	some	 gun 	 s 	 	for	lego	,	no	problem	.
and	at	a	certain	point	,	you	look	around	,	you	're	like	,	``	 who 	 a 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 nerd 	 y 	 	crowd	.	``
and	i	mean	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 nerd 	 y 	 	crowd	,	but	that	's	like	a	couple	of	 level 	 s 	 	above	 fur 	 ries 	 	.
the	 nerd 	 s 	 	here	,	they	get	laid	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	 lad 	 y 	 	with	the	 condom 	 s 	 	in	her	pocket	--	and	you	say	to	 your 	 self 	 	at	some	point	,	``	am	i	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	group	?	like	,	am	i	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	i	was	just	like	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	guess	i	am	.
i	'm	coming	out	.
i	'm	kind	of	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	and	i	'm	going	to	stop	 be 	 ing 	 	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	.	``
so	then	you	 re 	 ally 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	and	you	're	like	,	``	well	,	the	lego	people	in	denmark	,	they	've	got	all	 th 	 is 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	let	you	build	your	own	 virtual 	 ly 	 	.	``
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	 th 	 is 	 	cad	program	where	you	build	it	.
and	then	 what 	 ever 	 	you	design	 virtual 	 ly 	 	,	you	click	the	button	and	it	 show 	 s 	 	up	at	your	 door 	 step 	 	a	week	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	then	some	of	the	 design 	 s 	 	that	people	do	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	sell	in	the	store	.
the	lego	 guy 	 s 	 	do	n't	give	you	any	 royal 	 ties 	 	,	 strange 	 ly 	 	,	but	some	user	made	 th 	 is 	 	and	then	it	 s 	 old 	 	.
and	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
then	you	notice	that	if	that	lego	-	 provide 	 d 	 	cad	program	is	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	,	there	's	an	entire	open	-	source	,	third	-	party	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	lego	cad	program	that	lets	you	do	3d	 model 	 ing 	 	and	3d	 render 	 ing 	 	and	make	,	in	fact	,	 movie 	 s 	 	out	of	lego	,	3d	 film 	 s 	 	of	which	there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	on	youtube	,	and	some	of	them	sort	of	 mimic 	 king 	 	famous	 film 	 s 	 	and	some	 total 	 ly 	 	original	content	--	just	 beaut 	 iful 	 	--	and	people	 re 	 creating 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	have	to	take	a	moment	.
i	love	the	guy	who	's	like	running	away	with	his	 clasp 	 s 	 	,	his	 hook 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	 any 	 way 	 	.
there	's	a	whole	 programm 	 ing 	 	language	and	 robotic 	 s 	 	tool	,	so	if	you	want	to	teach	 some 	 one 	 	how	to	program	,	kid	,	adult	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
and	the	guy	that	made	 th 	 is 	 	,	he	made	a	 s 	 lot 	 	machine	out	of	lego	.
and	i	do	n't	mean	he	made	lego	that	 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	 s 	 lot 	 	machine	;	i	mean	he	made	a	 s 	 lot 	 	machine	out	of	lego	.
the	 insid 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	lego	.
there	's	people	 get 	 ting 	 	drunk	building	lego	,	and	you	've	got	to	finish	the	thing	before	you	 pu 	 ke 	 	.
there	's	a	whole	gray	market	for	lego	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	home	-	based	 business 	 es 	 	.
and	some	people	will	fund	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	lego	habit	by	selling	the	little	guy	,	but	then	you	have	no	 guy 	 s 	 	in	your	 ship 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	just	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	what	you	can	do	.
and	do	n't	kid	 your 	 self 	 	:	some	 architect 	 ural 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 credible 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	and	just	,	even	,	nature	out	of	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	little	 block 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	house	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	house	.
i	was	 af 	 raid 	 	a	car	was	going	to	come	 s 	 mash 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	taking	a	picture	for	you	 guy 	 s 	 	.
