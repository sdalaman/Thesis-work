i	'd	like	to	 apolog 	 ize 	 	,	first	of	all	,	to	all	of	you	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	no	form	of	powerpoint	 present 	 ation 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	,	every	now	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	will	make	 th 	 is 	 	 gest 	 ure 	 	,	and	in	a	moment	of	powerpoint	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	you	can	imagine	what	you	'd	like	to	see	.
i	do	a	radio	show	.
the	radio	show	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	infinite	monkey	cage	.	``
it	's	about	science	,	it	's	about	 rational 	 ism 	 	.
so	 there 	 fore 	 	,	we	get	a	lot	of	 complain 	 ts 	 	every	single	week	--	 complain 	 ts 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	one	we	get	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	which	is	to	say	the	 ver 	 y 	 	title	,	``	infinite	monkey	cage	,	``	 celebr 	 ates 	 	the	idea	of	 vivi 	 section 	 	.
we	have	made	it	 quit 	 e 	 	clear	to	these	people	that	an	infinite	monkey	cage	is	 room 	 y 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	had	 some 	 one 	 	else	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	'	the	infinite	monkey	cage	'	idea	is	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
an	infinite	number	of	 monkey 	 s 	 	could	never	write	the	 work 	 s 	 	of	shakespeare	.
we	know	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	did	an	experiment	.	``
 y 	 es 	 	,	they	 g 	 ave 	 	12	 monkey 	 s 	 	a	 type 	 writer 	 	for	a	week	,	and	after	a	week	,	they	 on 	 ly 	 	used	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bath 	 room 	 	.
so	the	main	element	 th 	 ough 	 	,	the	main	 complain 	 t 	 	we	get	--	and	one	that	i	find	most	 worry 	 ing 	 	--	is	that	people	say	,	``	oh	,	why	do	you	insist	on	 ruin 	 ing 	 	the	magic	?
you	 br 	 ing 	 	in	science	,	and	it	 ruin 	 s 	 	the	magic	.	``
now	i	'm	an	 art 	 s 	 	graduate	;	i	love	myth	and	magic	and	 existential 	 ism 	 	and	self	-	 loath 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	what	i	do	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	do	n't	understand	how	it	 do 	 es 	 	ruin	the	magic	.
all	of	the	magic	,	i	think	,	that	may	well	be	taken	away	by	science	is	then	 replace 	 d 	 	by	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
 astro 	 logy 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	:	like	 man 	 y 	 	 rational 	 ists 	 	,	i	'm	a	pisces	.
now	 astro 	 logy 	 	--	we	 re 	 move 	 	the	 ban 	 al 	 	idea	that	your	life	could	be	 predict 	 ed 	 	;	that	you	'll	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	meet	a	 luck 	 y 	 	man	who	's	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	hat	.
that	is	gone	.
but	if	we	want	to	look	at	the	sky	and	see	 predict 	 ions 	 	,	we	still	can	.
we	can	see	 predict 	 ions 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	,	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	 coll 	 id 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	each	other	,	of	new	solar	 system 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
if	the	 s 	 un 	 	could	one	day	--	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	the	earth	,	in	fact	--	if	the	earth	could	read	 it 	 s 	 	own	 astro 	 logical 	 	,	astronomical	chart	,	one	day	it	would	say	,	``	not	a	good	day	for	making	 plan 	 s 	 	.
you	'll	 be 	 en 	 	 engulf 	 ed 	 	by	a	red	giant	.	``
and	that	to	me	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	that	if	you	think	i	'm	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 world 	 s 	 	,	well	 man 	 y 	 	 world 	 s 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	--	one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 fasci 	 nating 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 terrify 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	from	the	 quant 	 um 	 	 interpret 	 ation 	 	--	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
that	every	person	here	,	every	decision	that	you	've	made	 to 	 day 	 	,	every	decision	you	've	made	in	your	life	,	you	've	not	 re 	 ally 	 	made	that	decision	,	but	in	fact	,	every	single	 per 	 mutation 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	is	made	,	each	one	going	off	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
that	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	idea	.
if	you	ever	think	that	your	life	is	 rub 	 b 	 ish 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	remember	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	you	that	's	made	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	than	that	.
if	you	ever	think	,	``	ah	,	i	want	to	end	it	all	,	``	do	n't	end	it	all	.
remember	that	in	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	even	exist	in	the	first	place	.
 th 	 is 	 	to	me	,	in	 it 	 s 	 	own	strange	way	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 ing 	 	.
now	 re 	 incarnation 	 	,	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	gone	--	the	 after 	 life 	 	.
but	it	's	not	gone	.
science	 actual 	 ly 	 	 say 	 s 	 	we	will	live	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
well	,	there	is	one	 prov 	 iso 	 	.
we	wo	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	live	 fore 	 ver 	 	.	you	wo	n't	live	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
your	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	the	you	-	ness	of	you	,	the	me	-	ness	of	me	--	that	 get 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	go	.
but	every	single	thing	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	,	every	atom	in	us	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	myriad	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	and	will	go	on	to	create	a	myriad	of	new	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 mountain 	 s 	 	and	 apple 	 s 	 	and	 puls 	 ar 	 s 	 	and	other	people	's	 knee 	 s 	 	.
who	 know 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	one	of	your	 atom 	 s 	 	was	once	napoleon	's	knee	.
that	is	a	good	thing	.
 un 	 like 	 	the	 occu 	 pants 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 it 	 self 	 	is	not	 waste 	 ful 	 	.
we	are	all	 total 	 ly 	 	 recycl 	 able 	 	.
and	when	we	die	,	we	do	n't	even	have	to	be	 place 	 d 	 	in	different	 re 	 fuse 	 	 sac 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
 understand 	 ing 	 	,	to	me	,	 do 	 es 	 	not	 re 	 move 	 	the	wonder	and	the	joy	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	my	wife	could	turn	to	me	and	she	may	say	,	``	why	do	you	love	me	?	``
and	i	can	with	all	 honest 	 y 	 	look	her	in	the	eye	and	say	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 pherom 	 one 	 s 	 	 match 	 ed 	 	our	 ol 	 factor 	 y 	 	 receptor 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 ough 	 	i	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	 al 	 so 	 	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	her	hair	and	 personal 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	that	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	there	.
love	 do 	 es 	 	not	die	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	thing	.
pain	 do 	 es 	 	n't	go	away	either	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	understand	pain	.
if	 some 	 one 	 	 punch 	 es 	 	me	--	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	my	 personal 	 ity 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	a	regular	 occur 	 rence 	 	--	i	understand	where	the	pain	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
it	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 moment 	 um 	 	to	energy	where	the	four	-	vector	is	constant	--	that	's	what	it	is	.
but	at	no	point	can	i	react	and	go	,	``	ha	!	is	that	the	best	 moment 	 um 	 	-	to	-	energy	fourth	vector	constant	you	've	got	?	``
no	,	i	just	 s 	 pit 	 	out	a	tooth	.
and	that	is	all	of	these	different	 thing 	 s 	 	--	the	love	for	my	child	.
i	have	a	son	.	his	name	is	archie	.
i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	better	than	all	the	other	children	.
now	i	know	you	do	n't	think	that	.
you	may	well	have	your	own	children	and	think	,	``	oh	no	,	my	child	's	best	.	``
that	's	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	about	evolution	--	the	 pre 	 d 	 ile 	 ction 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	our	child	is	best	.
now	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	that	's	just	a	 surviv 	 al 	 	thing	.
the	fact	we	see	here	is	the	vehicle	for	our	 gene 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	love	it	.
but	we	do	n't	notice	that	bit	;	we	just	 un 	 condition 	 ally 	 	love	.
that	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
 th 	 ough 	 	i	should	say	that	my	son	is	best	and	is	better	than	your	children	.
i	've	 d 	 one 	 	some	 test 	 s 	 	.
and	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	me	give	 s 	 uch 	 	joy	and	 excit 	 ement 	 	and	wonder	.
even	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	can	give	you	an	excuse	for	bad	 house 	 work 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	at	home	for	a	week	on	your	own	.
you	house	is	in	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	state	.
your	partner	is	about	to	return	.
you	think	,	what	should	i	do	?
do	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
all	you	have	to	do	is	,	when	she	 walk 	 s 	 	in	,	using	a	 quant 	 um 	 	 interpret 	 ation 	 	,	say	,	``	i	'm	so	sorry	.
i	 stop 	 ped 	 	 observ 	 ing 	 	the	house	for	a	moment	,	and	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 observ 	 ing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	``
that	's	the	strong	 anthro 	 pic 	 	principle	of	 vacuum 	 ing 	 	.
for	me	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	.
even	on	my	journey	up	here	--	the	joy	that	i	have	on	my	journey	up	here	every	single	time	.
if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	,	you	 re 	 move 	 	the	myth	and	there	is	still	 some 	 thing 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	train	.
every	time	i	breathe	in	,	i	'm	 breath 	 ing 	 	in	a	million	-	billion	-	billion	 atom 	 s 	 	of	oxygen	.
i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	chair	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	know	the	chair	is	made	of	 atom 	 s 	 	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	empty	space	,	i	find	it	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
i	look	out	the	window	,	and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	every	single	time	we	stop	and	i	look	out	that	window	,	 frame 	 d 	 	in	that	window	,	 where 	 ver 	 	we	are	,	i	am	 observ 	 ing 	 	more	life	than	there	is	in	the	rest	of	the	known	 uni 	 verse 	 	beyond	the	planet	earth	.
if	you	go	to	the	safari	 park 	 s 	 	on	saturn	or	jupiter	,	you	will	be	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	i	'm	 observ 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	brain	,	the	human	brain	,	the	most	complex	thing	in	the	known	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
that	,	to	me	,	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	.
and	do	you	know	what	,	that	might	be	 en 	 ough 	 	.
steven	weinberg	,	the	 no 	 bel 	 	laureate	,	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	more	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	 comprehens 	 ible 	 	,	the	more	it	 seem 	 s 	 	 point 	 less 	 	.	``
now	for	some	people	,	that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	lead	to	an	idea	of	 nihil 	 ism 	 	.
but	for	me	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.	that	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
i	'm	glad	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 point 	 less 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	if	i	get	to	the	end	of	my	life	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	ca	n't	turn	to	me	and	go	,	``	what	have	you	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	you	idiot	?
that	's	not	the	point	.	``
i	can	make	my	own	purpose	.
you	can	make	your	own	purpose	.
we	have	the	individual	power	to	go	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	want	to	do	.	``
and	in	a	 point 	 less 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	that	,	to	me	,	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
i	have	 chose 	 n 	 	to	make	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	 joke 	 s 	 	about	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	and	the	copenhagen	 interpret 	 ation 	 	.
you	,	i	imagine	,	can	do	much	better	 thing 	 s 	 	with	your	time	.
