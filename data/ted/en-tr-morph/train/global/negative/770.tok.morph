i	want	to	talk	about	my	 investigation 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	what	technology	 mean 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	--	not	just	our	 im 	 mediate 	 	life	,	but	in	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	sense	,	in	the	kind	of	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	world	and	our	place	in	the	world	:	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	?
what	is	the	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	?
and	so	,	i	want	to	kind	of	go	through	my	little	story	of	what	i	found	out	.
and	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	investigate	was	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	name	of	technology	.
and	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	there	is	a	state	of	the	 un 	 ion 	 	address	 give 	 n 	 	by	every	 p 	 resident 	 	since	1790	.
and	each	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 summ 	 ing 	 	up	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	at	that	time	.
if	you	search	for	the	word	``	technology	,	``	it	was	not	used	 un 	 til 	 	1952	.
so	,	technology	was	sort	of	absent	from	 every 	 body 	 	's	 think 	 ing 	 	 un 	 til 	 	1952	,	which	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	year	of	my	birth	.
and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	technology	had	 exist 	 ed 	 	before	then	,	but	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	aware	of	it	,	and	so	it	was	sort	of	an	 awake 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	force	in	our	life	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	research	to	find	out	the	first	use	of	the	word	``	technology	.	``
it	was	in	1829	,	and	it	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	a	guy	who	was	 start 	 ing 	 	a	curriculum	--	a	course	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	together	all	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 art 	 s 	 	and	 craft 	 s 	 	,	and	industry	--	and	he	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	technology	.	``
and	that	's	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	use	of	the	word	.
so	,	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	that	we	're	all	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	,	and	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	?
alan	kay	 call 	 s 	 	it	,	``	technology	is	 any 	 thing 	 	that	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	after	you	 we 	 re 	 	born	.	``
which	is	sort	of	the	idea	that	we	 normal 	 ly 	 	have	about	what	technology	is	:	it	's	all	that	new	stuff	.
it	's	not	 road 	 s 	 	,	or	 pen 	 icillin 	 	,	or	 factor 	 y 	 	 tire 	 s 	 	;	it	's	the	new	stuff	.
my	friend	danny	hillis	 say 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	similar	one	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	technology	is	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	yet	.	``
which	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	sense	that	it	's	all	new	.
but	we	know	that	it	's	just	not	new	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	way	back	,	and	what	i	want	to	suggest	is	it	 go 	 es 	 	a	long	way	back	.
so	,	 an 	 other 	 	way	to	think	about	technology	,	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	,	is	to	imagine	a	world	 with 	 out 	 	technology	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	eliminate	every	single	bit	of	technology	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	--	and	i	mean	 every 	 thing 	 	,	from	 blade 	 s 	 	to	 scrap 	 ers 	 	to	cloth	--	we	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	would	not	live	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.
we	would	die	by	the	 billion 	 s 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	:	the	 wo 	 lv 	 es 	 	would	get	us	,	we	would	be	 defense 	 less 	 	,	we	would	be	 un 	 able 	 	to	grow	 en 	 ough 	 	food	,	or	find	 en 	 ough 	 	food	.
even	the	hunter	-	 gatherer 	 s 	 	used	some	 element 	 ary 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	they	had	minimal	technology	,	but	they	had	some	technology	.
and	if	we	 stud 	 y 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	hunter	-	gatherer	 tribe 	 s 	 	and	the	neanderthal	,	which	are	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	early	man	,	we	find	out	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	world	 with 	 out 	 	technology	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kind	of	a	 curv 	 e 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	average	age	.
there	are	no	neanderthal	 fossil 	 s 	 	that	are	 old 	 er 	 	than	40	 year 	 s 	 	old	that	we	've	ever	found	,	and	the	average	age	of	most	of	these	hunter	-	gatherer	 tribe 	 s 	 	is	20	to	30	.
there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	young	 infant 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	die	--	high	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rate	--	and	there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	few	old	people	.
and	so	the	profile	is	sort	of	for	your	average	san	francisco	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	:	a	lot	of	young	people	.
and	if	you	go	there	,	you	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 health 	 y 	 	.	``
well	,	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	all	young	.
and	the	same	thing	with	the	hunter	-	gatherer	 tribe 	 s 	 	and	early	man	is	that	you	did	n't	live	beyond	the	age	of	30	.
so	,	it	was	a	world	 with 	 out 	 	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
and	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	the	 transmit 	 ter 	 	of	cultural	evolution	and	information	.
imagine	a	world	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 every 	 body 	 	was	20	to	30	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
how	much	 learn 	 ing 	 	can	you	do	?
you	ca	n't	do	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 learn 	 ing 	 	in	your	own	life	,	it	's	so	short	,	and	there	's	 no 	 body 	 	to	pass	on	what	you	do	learn	.
so	,	that	's	one	 a 	 spect 	 	.
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	life	.	but	at	the	same	time	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	know	that	most	hunter	-	gatherer	 tribe 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	with	that	 ver 	 y 	 	little	technology	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	not	 s 	 pend 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	 gather 	 ing 	 	the	food	that	they	 need 	 ed 	 	:	three	to	six	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
some	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	call	that	the	original	 af 	 fluent 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	 bank 	 er 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
so	,	it	was	possible	to	get	 en 	 ough 	 	food	.
but	when	the	 scar 	 city 	 	came	when	the	 high 	 s 	 	and	 low 	 s 	 	and	the	 drought 	 s 	 	came	,	then	people	went	 in 	 to 	 	 starv 	 ation 	 	.
and	that	's	why	they	did	n't	live	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.
so	,	what	technology	 br 	 ought 	 	,	through	the	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 tool 	 s 	 	like	these	stone	 tool 	 s 	 	here	--	even	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	small	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	the	early	 band 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	able	to	eliminate	to	 extinct 	 ion 	 	about	250	 mega 	 fauna 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	in	north	america	when	they	first	 arriv 	 ed 	 	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	,	long	before	the	industrial	age	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	the	planet	on	a	global	scale	,	with	just	a	small	amount	of	technology	.
the	other	thing	that	the	early	man	 invent 	 ed 	 	was	fire	.
and	fire	was	used	to	clear	out	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 affect 	 ed 	 	the	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	grass	and	whole	 continent 	 s 	 	,	and	was	used	in	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
it	enabled	us	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	eat	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	was	sort	of	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	in	a	mcluhan	sense	,	an	external	stomach	,	in	the	sense	that	it	was	 cook 	 ing 	 	food	that	we	could	not	eat	 other 	 wise 	 	.
and	if	we	do	n't	have	fire	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	could	not	live	.
our	bodies	have	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	these	new	 diet 	 s 	 	.
our	bodies	have	 change 	 d 	 	in	the	last	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	with	that	little	bit	of	technology	,	 human 	 s 	 	went	from	a	small	band	of	10,000	or	so	--	the	same	number	 a 	 s 	 	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	--	and	we	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 explode 	 d 	 	.	with	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	language	around	50,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	number	of	 human 	 s 	 	 explode 	 d 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	species	on	the	planet	.
and	they	 migr 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	rest	of	the	world	at	two	 kilometer 	 s 	 	per	year	 un 	 til 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	occupied	every	single	 water 	 shed 	 	on	the	planet	and	 be 	 came 	 	the	most	 domin 	 ant 	 	species	,	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	amount	of	technology	.
and	even	at	that	time	,	with	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	8,000	,	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	see	climate	change	.
so	,	climate	change	is	not	a	new	thing	.
what	's	new	is	just	the	degree	of	it	.	even	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 agricultur 	 al 	 	age	there	was	climate	change	.
and	so	,	 al 	 ready 	 	small	 amount 	 s 	 	of	technology	 we 	 re 	 	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	world	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	and	where	i	'm	going	,	is	that	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	force	in	the	world	.
all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	see	 to 	 day 	 	that	are	changing	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	we	can	 al 	 ways 	 	trace	back	to	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	some	new	technology	.
so	,	it	's	a	force	that	is	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	force	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 unleash 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	and	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	degree	that	i	think	that	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	our	--	who	we	are	.
in	fact	,	our	 human 	 ity 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	think	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	've	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	we	've	 invent 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	of	all	the	 animal 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 domestic 	 ated 	 	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	animal	that	we	've	 domestic 	 ated 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	us	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
so	,	 human 	 ity 	 	is	our	 great 	 est 	 	 invent 	 ion 	 	.
but	of	course	we	're	not	 d 	 one 	 	yet	.
we	're	still	 invent 	 ing 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	technology	is	 allow 	 ing 	 	us	to	do	--	it	's	 continu 	 ally 	 	to	 re 	 invent 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	force	.
i	call	 th 	 is 	 	entire	thing	--	us	 human 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	technology	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	've	made	,	 gadget 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	--	we	call	that	the	 techni 	 um 	 	.	that	's	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
my	 work 	 ing 	 	definition	of	technology	is	``	 any 	 thing 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	that	a	human	mind	 make 	 s 	 	.	``
it	's	not	just	 hammer 	 s 	 	and	 gadget 	 s 	 	,	like	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	law	.	and	of	course	cities	are	ways	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	more	 use 	 ful 	 	to	us	.
while	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	our	mind	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 root 	 s 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	back	.	the	 origin 	 s 	 	and	 root 	 s 	 	of	technology	go	back	to	the	big	bang	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	in	that	they	are	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	 th 	 read 	 	that	 start 	 s 	 	at	the	big	bang	and	 go 	 es 	 	through	 galax 	 ies 	 	and	 star 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	life	,	 in 	 to 	 	us	.
and	the	three	major	 phase 	 s 	 	of	the	early	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	energy	,	when	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	force	was	energy	;	then	it	 be 	 came 	 	,	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	force	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 cool 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 came 	 	matter	;	and	then	,	with	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	life	,	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	force	in	our	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	 be 	 came 	 	information	.
that	's	what	life	is	:	it	's	an	information	process	that	was	 rest 	 ructur 	 ing 	 	and	making	new	order	.
so	,	 t 	 hose 	 	energy	,	matter	einstein	show	 we 	 re 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	,	and	now	new	 science 	 s 	 	of	 quant 	 um 	 	computing	show	that	 ent 	 ropy 	 	and	information	and	matter	and	energy	are	all	 inter 	 related 	 	,	so	it	's	one	long	 continu 	 um 	 	.
you	put	energy	 in 	 to 	 	the	right	kind	of	system	and	out	 come 	 s 	 	 waste 	 d 	 	heat	,	 ent 	 ropy 	 	and	 extr 	 opy 	 	,	which	is	order	.
it	's	the	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	order	.
where	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	order	come	from	?	 it 	 s 	 	 root 	 s 	 	go	way	back	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	know	.
but	we	do	know	that	the	self	-	 organ 	 ization 	 	trend	 through 	 out 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	long	,	and	it	 beg 	 an 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 galax 	 ies 	 	;	they	 maintain 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	order	for	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 star 	 s 	 	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	nuclear	fusion	 machine 	 s 	 	that	self	-	organize	and	self	-	sustain	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	for	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	order	against	the	 ent 	 ropy 	 	of	the	world	.
and	 flower 	 s 	 	and	 plant 	 s 	 	are	the	same	thing	,	 extend 	 ed 	 	,	and	technology	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	life	.
one	trend	that	we	notice	in	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	that	the	amount	of	energy	per	gram	per	second	that	 flow 	 s 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	increasing	.
the	amount	of	energy	is	increasing	through	 th 	 is 	 	little	sequence	.
and	that	the	amount	of	energy	per	gram	per	second	that	 flow 	 s 	 	through	life	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 great 	 er 	 	than	a	star	--	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	star	's	long	 life 	 span 	 	,	the	energy	density	in	life	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 high 	 er 	 	than	a	star	.
and	the	energy	density	that	we	see	in	the	 great 	 est 	 	of	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	a	pc	chip	.
there	is	more	energy	 flow 	 ing 	 	through	,	per	gram	per	second	,	than	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	have	any	other	experience	with	.
what	i	would	suggest	is	that	if	you	want	to	see	where	technology	is	going	,	we	 continu 	 e 	 	that	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	,	and	we	say	``	well	what	's	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	energy	-	dense	,	that	's	where	it	's	going	.	``	and	so	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	,	i	've	taken	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	other	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	life	and	say	,	``	what	are	the	general	 trend 	 s 	 	in	 evolution 	 ary 	 	life	?	``
and	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	 special 	 ization 	 	,	 senti 	 ence 	 	,	 ubiqu 	 ity 	 	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 evolv 	 ability 	 	:	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	same	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	present	in	technology	.
that	's	where	technology	is	going	.
in	fact	,	technology	is	 accele 	 rating 	 	all	the	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	life	,	and	we	can	see	that	 happen 	 ing 	 	;	just	 a 	 s 	 	there	's	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	life	,	there	's	more	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	 thing 	 s 	 	we	make	.
 thing 	 s 	 	in	life	start	out	 be 	 ing 	 	general	cell	,	and	they	 be 	 come 	 	 special 	 ized 	 	:	you	have	tissue	 cell 	 s 	 	,	you	have	muscle	,	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	.	and	same	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	with	say	,	a	hammer	,	which	is	general	at	first	and	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	specific	.
so	,	i	would	like	to	say	that	while	there	is	six	 king 	 dom 	 s 	 	of	life	,	we	can	think	of	technology	 bas 	 ically 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 seven 	 th 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	of	life	.
it	's	a	 branch 	 ing 	 	off	from	the	human	form	.
but	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	agenda	,	like	 any 	 thing 	 	,	like	life	 it 	 self 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	right	now	,	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	the	energy	that	we	use	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	to	feed	the	 techni 	 um 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
in	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	it	's	not	to	move	us	,	it	's	to	move	the	stuff	that	we	make	or	buy	.
i	use	the	word	``	want	.	``	technology	 want 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	robot	that	 want 	 s 	 	to	plug	 it 	 self 	 	in	to	get	more	power	.
your	cat	 want 	 s 	 	more	food	.
a	 bacter 	 ium 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 conscious 	 ness 	 	at	all	,	 want 	 s 	 	to	move	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	light	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	urge	,	and	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	an	urge	.
at	the	same	time	,	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	give	us	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	what	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	progress	.
you	can	take	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 curv 	 es 	 	,	and	they	're	all	 point 	 ing 	 	up	.
there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	no	 disput 	 e 	 	about	progress	,	if	we	 dis 	 count 	 	the	cost	of	that	.
and	that	's	the	thing	that	 both 	 ers 	 	most	people	,	is	that	progress	is	 re 	 ally 	 	real	,	but	we	wonder	and	question	:	what	are	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	of	it	?
i	did	a	survey	of	a	number	of	species	of	 artifact 	 s 	 	in	my	house	,	and	there	's	6,000	.	other	people	have	come	up	with	10,000	.
when	king	henry	of	england	 di 	 ed 	 	,	he	had	18,000	 thing 	 s 	 	in	his	house	,	but	that	was	the	entire	wealth	of	england	.
and	with	that	entire	wealth	of	england	,	king	henry	could	not	buy	any	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	,	he	could	not	buy	 refrige 	 ration 	 	,	he	could	not	buy	a	trip	of	a	thousand	 mile 	 s 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	rickshaw	wale	in	india	could	 s 	 ave 	 	up	and	buy	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	and	he	could	buy	 refrige 	 ration 	 	.
he	could	buy	 thing 	 s 	 	that	king	henry	,	in	all	his	wealth	,	could	never	buy	.
that	's	what	progress	is	about	.
so	,	technology	is	 self 	 ish 	 	;	technology	is	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	.
that	conflict	,	that	tension	,	will	be	with	us	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	do	what	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	do	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	going	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	for	us	.
we	have	 con 	 fusion 	 	about	what	we	should	think	about	a	new	technology	.
right	now	the	default	position	about	when	a	new	technology	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	is	we	--	people	talk	about	the	 pre 	 caution 	 ary 	 	principle	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	common	in	europe	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	``	do	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.	when	you	meet	a	new	 un 	 til 	 	it	can	be	proven	that	there	's	no	harm	.	``
i	think	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	 no 	 where 	 	.
but	a	better	way	is	to	,	what	i	call	 pro 	 action 	 ary 	 	principle	,	which	is	:	you	engage	with	technology	.
you	try	it	out	.
you	 obvious 	 ly 	 	do	what	the	 pre 	 caution 	 ary 	 	principle	 suggest 	 s 	 	,	you	try	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	it	,	but	after	 anticip 	 ating 	 	it	,	you	 constant 	 ly 	 	 ass 	 es 	 	it	,	not	just	once	,	but	 e 	 ternal 	 ly 	 	.
and	when	it	 divert 	 s 	 	from	what	you	want	,	we	 priori 	 tize 	 	risk	,	we	evaluate	not	just	the	new	stuff	,	but	the	old	stuff	.
we	fix	it	,	but	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	we	 re 	 locate 	 	it	.
and	what	i	mean	by	that	is	that	we	find	a	new	job	for	it	.
nuclear	energy	,	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	idea	but	it	may	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	idea	 re 	 locate 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	nuclear	energy	for	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 burn 	 ing 	 	coal	.
when	we	have	a	bad	idea	,	the	 respons 	 e 	 	to	a	bad	idea	is	not	no	 idea 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	to	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	.
the	 respons 	 e 	 	to	a	bad	idea	--	like	,	say	,	a	 t 	 ung 	 sten 	 	light	bulb	--	is	a	better	idea	.	ok	?
so	,	better	 idea 	 s 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	--	 al 	 ways 	 	the	 respons 	 e 	 	to	technology	that	we	do	n't	like	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	better	technology	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	technology	is	a	kind	of	a	method	for	generating	better	 idea 	 s 	 	,	if	you	can	think	about	it	that	way	.
so	,	 may 	 be 	 	 spray 	 ing 	 	ddt	on	 crop 	 s 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	idea	.
but	ddt	 spray 	 ed 	 	on	local	 home 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	better	to	eliminate	malaria	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	insect	ddt	-	 impregnate 	 d 	 	mosquito	 net 	 s 	 	.
but	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	idea	;	that	's	a	good	job	for	technology	.
so	,	our	job	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	is	to	parent	our	mind	children	,	to	find	them	good	 friend 	 s 	 	,	to	find	them	a	good	job	.
and	so	,	every	technology	is	sort	of	a	creative	force	looking	for	the	right	job	.
that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	my	son	,	right	here	.
there	are	no	bad	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	no	bad	children	.
we	do	n't	say	children	are	neutral	,	children	are	positive	.
we	just	have	to	find	them	the	right	place	.
and	so	,	what	technology	 give 	 s 	 	us	,	over	the	long	term	,	over	the	sort	of	 extend 	 ed 	 	evolution	--	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	time	,	through	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	the	evolution	of	life	,	the	evolution	of	 brain 	 s 	 	--	what	that	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	giving	us	is	increasing	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	:	it	's	increasing	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	it	's	increasing	 option 	 s 	 	,	it	's	increasing	 choice 	 s 	 	,	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	,	 possibil 	 ities 	 	and	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	we	get	from	technology	all	the	time	.	that	's	why	people	 leav 	 e 	 	 village 	 s 	 	and	go	 in 	 to 	 	cities	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 gravit 	 ating 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	and	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
and	we	are	aware	of	the	price	.
we	pay	a	price	for	that	,	but	we	are	aware	of	it	,	and	 general 	 ly 	 	we	will	pay	the	price	for	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	,	 choice 	 s 	 	and	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
even	technology	 want 	 s 	 	clean	water	.
is	technology	 dia 	 metric 	 ally 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	nature	?
 be 	 cause 	 	technology	is	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	life	,	it	's	in	parallel	and	 align 	 ed 	 	with	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	that	life	 want 	 s 	 	.
so	that	i	think	technology	 love 	 s 	 	biology	,	if	we	allow	it	to	.
great	 move 	 ment 	 	that	is	 start 	 ing 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	is	moving	through	us	and	it	 continu 	 es 	 	to	go	,	and	our	choice	,	so	to	speak	,	in	technology	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	to	align	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	force	much	 great 	 er 	 	than	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	,	technology	is	more	than	just	the	stuff	in	your	pocket	.
it	's	more	than	just	 gadget 	 s 	 	;	it	's	more	than	just	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	invent	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	part	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	story	,	a	great	story	,	that	 beg 	 an 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	it	's	moving	through	us	,	 th 	 is 	 	self	-	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	and	we	're	 extend 	 ing 	 	and	 accele 	 rating 	 	it	,	and	we	can	be	part	of	it	by	 align 	 ing 	 	the	technology	that	we	make	with	it	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciate	your	attention	 to 	 day 	 	.	thank	you	.
