so	,	a	funny	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	my	way	to	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	world	-	class	 neuro 	 psycho 	 logist 	 	:	i	had	a	baby	.
and	that	's	not	to	say	i	ever	went	on	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	world	-	class	 neuro 	 psycho 	 logist 	 	.
sorry	,	ted	.
but	i	did	go	on	to	be	a	 reason 	 ably 	 	astute	,	 argu 	 ably 	 	world	-	class	 worri 	 er 	 	.
one	of	my	 girlfriend 	 s 	 	in	graduate	school	,	marie	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	kim	,	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	.
it	's	not	that	you	're	more	 neuro 	 tic 	 	than	 every 	 one 	 	else	;	it	's	just	that	you	're	more	honest	about	how	 neuro 	 tic 	 	you	are	.	``
so	in	the	spirit	of	full	 dis 	 closure 	 	,	i	 br 	 ought 	 	some	 picture 	 s 	 	to	share	.
awwww	.
i	'll	just	say	,	july	.
zzzzzzip	for	 safe 	 ty 	 	.
water	 wing 	 s 	 	--	an	inch	of	water	.
and	then	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	all	 suit 	 ed 	 	up	for	the	90	-	minute	drive	to	 cop 	 per 	 	mountain	.
so	you	can	get	kind	of	a	feel	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	my	baby	,	vander	,	is	eight	 year 	 s 	 	old	now	.
and	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 cur 	 s 	 ed 	 	with	my	athletic	 in 	 ability 	 	,	he	 play 	 s 	 	soccer	.
he	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 play 	 ing 	 	 foot 	 ball 	 	.
he	 want 	 s 	 	to	learn	how	to	ride	a	 uni 	 cycle 	 	.
so	why	would	i	worry	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	do	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	teach	.
it	's	what	i	 stud 	 y 	 	.	it	's	what	i	treat	.
and	i	know	that	 kid 	 s 	 	get	 concuss 	 ed 	 	every	year	.
in	fact	,	more	than	four	million	people	sustain	a	 concuss 	 ion 	 	every	year	,	and	these	data	are	just	among	 kid 	 s 	 	under	14	who	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 een 	 	in	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	rooms	.
and	so	when	 kid 	 s 	 	sustain	a	 concuss 	 ion 	 	,	we	talk	about	them	 get 	 ting 	 	 d 	 ing 	 ed 	 	or	 get 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bell	rung	,	but	what	is	it	that	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?
let	's	take	a	look	.
all	right	.	``	starsky	and	hutch	,	``	 argu 	 ably 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
so	a	car	accident	.
forty	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	 in 	 to 	 	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 	--	35	gs	.
a	heavy	weight	 box 	 er 	 	 punch 	 es 	 	you	straight	in	the	face	--	58	gs	.
in	case	you	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	it	,	we	'll	look	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	look	to	the	right	-	hand	side	of	the	screen	.
what	would	you	say	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	gs	?
close	.
seventy	-	two	.
would	it	be	crazy	to	know	,	103	gs	.
the	average	 concuss 	 ive 	 	impact	is	95	gs	.
now	,	when	the	kid	on	the	right	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	up	,	we	know	they	've	had	a	 concuss 	 ion 	 	.
but	how	about	the	kid	on	the	left	,	or	the	athlete	that	 leav 	 es 	 	the	field	of	play	?
how	do	we	know	if	he	or	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 sustain 	 ed 	 	a	 concuss 	 ion 	 	?
how	do	we	know	that	 legisl 	 ation 	 	that	would	 requir 	 e 	 	that	they	be	 pull 	 ed 	 	from	play	,	 clear 	 ed 	 	for	return	to	play	,	 appli 	 es 	 	to	them	?
the	definition	of	 concuss 	 ion 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	a	loss	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
it	 requir 	 es 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	change	in	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	and	that	can	be	any	one	of	a	number	of	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	 fog 	 gy 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	dizzy	,	 hear 	 ing 	 	a	 ring 	 ing 	 	in	your	ear	,	 be 	 ing 	 	more	 im 	 puls 	 ive 	 	or	 hostil 	 e 	 	than	usual	.
so	 give 	 n 	 	all	of	that	and	 give 	 n 	 	how	darn	 neuro 	 tic 	 	i	am	,	how	do	i	get	any	sleep	at	all	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	our	 brain 	 s 	 	are	 resili 	 ent 	 	.
they	're	designed	to	 re 	 cover 	 	from	an	 in 	 jury 	 	.
if	,	god	forbid	,	any	of	us	left	here	 to 	 night 	 	and	 sustain 	 ed 	 	a	 concuss 	 ion 	 	,	most	of	us	would	go	on	to	fully	 re 	 cover 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	couple	 hour 	 s 	 	to	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	.
but	 kid 	 s 	 	are	more	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	brain	 in 	 jury 	 	.
in	fact	,	high	school	 athlete 	 s 	 	are	three	 time 	 s 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	sustain	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 inju 	 ries 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	even	to	 the 	 ir 	 	college	-	age	 peer 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 take 	 s 	 	them	 long 	 er 	 	to	return	to	a	symptom	-	free	 base 	 line 	 	.
after	that	first	 in 	 jury 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	risk	for	second	 in 	 jury 	 	is	 exponential 	 ly 	 	 great 	 er 	 	.
from	there	,	 the 	 ir 	 	risk	for	a	third	 in 	 jury 	 	,	 great 	 er 	 	still	,	and	so	on	.
and	here	's	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 alarm 	 ing 	 	part	:	we	do	n't	fully	understand	the	long	-	term	impact	of	 multi 	 ple 	 	 inju 	 ries 	 	.
you	 guy 	 s 	 	may	be	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	research	that	's	coming	out	of	the	nfl	.
in	a	 nut 	 shell 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	research	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	among	 retire 	 d 	 	nfl	 player 	 s 	 	with	three	or	more	 care 	 er 	 	 concuss 	 ions 	 	,	the	 incident 	 s 	 	of	early	-	 on 	 set 	 	 de 	 ment 	 ing 	 	disease	is	much	 great 	 er 	 	than	it	is	for	the	general	population	.
so	you	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	that	--	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	it	.
what	you	may	not	be	familiar	with	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	research	was	 spear 	 headed 	 	by	nfl	wives	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	is	n't	it	weird	that	my	46	-	year	-	old	husband	is	 fore 	 ver 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	his	 key 	 s 	 	?
is	n't	it	weird	that	my	47	-	year	-	old	husband	is	 fore 	 ver 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	car	?
is	n't	it	weird	that	my	48	-	year	-	old	husband	is	 fore 	 ver 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	his	way	home	in	the	car	,	from	the	 drive 	 way 	 	?	``
so	i	may	have	 for 	 gotten 	 	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	my	son	is	an	 on 	 ly 	 	child	.
so	it	's	going	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	he	be	able	to	drive	me	around	some	day	.
so	how	do	we	guarantee	the	 safe 	 ty 	 	of	our	 kid 	 s 	 	?
how	can	we	100	percent	guarantee	the	 safe 	 ty 	 	of	our	 kid 	 s 	 	?
let	me	tell	you	what	i	've	come	up	with	.
if	 on 	 ly 	 	.
my	little	boy	's	right	there	,	and	he	's	like	,	``	she	's	not	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
she	's	 total 	 ly 	 	not	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.	``
so	in	all	 serious 	 ness 	 	,	should	my	kid	play	 foot 	 ball 	 	?
should	your	kid	play	 foot 	 ball 	 	?	i	do	n't	know	.
but	i	do	know	there	are	three	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	.
the	first	:	 stud 	 y 	 	up	.
you	have	to	be	familiar	with	the	 issue 	 s 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
there	are	some	great	 resource 	 s 	 	out	there	.
the	cdc	 ha 	 s 	 	a	program	,	 head 	 s 	 	up	.
it	's	at	cdc.gov	.
 head 	 s 	 	up	is	specific	to	 concuss 	 ion 	 	in	 kid 	 s 	 	.
the	second	is	a	resource	i	'm	 personal 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	proud	of	.
we	've	just	 roll 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	out	in	the	last	couple	 month 	 s 	 	--	co	 kid 	 s 	 	with	brain	 in 	 jury 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	resource	for	student	 athlete 	 s 	 	,	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 professional 	 s 	 	,	athletic	and	 coach 	 ing 	 	staff	.
it	's	a	great	place	to	start	if	you	have	 question 	 s 	 	.
the	second	thing	is	:	speak	up	.
just	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	bill	 introduc 	 ed 	 	by	senator	kefalas	that	would	have	 requir 	 ed 	 	 athlete 	 s 	 	,	 kid 	 s 	 	under	18	,	to	wear	a	helmet	when	they	're	 rid 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bike	 di 	 ed 	 	in	 commit 	 tee 	 	.
it	 di 	 ed 	 	in	large	part	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 lack 	 ed 	 	 constit 	 uent 	 	buy	-	in	;	it	 lack 	 ed 	 	 s 	 take 	 holder 	 	 tract 	 ion 	 	.
now	i	'm	not	here	to	tell	you	what	kind	of	 legisl 	 ation 	 	you	should	or	should	n't	support	,	but	i	am	going	to	tell	you	that	,	if	it	 matter 	 s 	 	to	you	,	your	 legisl 	 ators 	 	need	to	know	that	.
speak	up	 al 	 so 	 	with	 coach 	 ing 	 	staff	.
ask	about	what	kind	of	 protect 	 ive 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	is	 avail 	 able 	 	.
what	's	the	budget	for	 protect 	 ive 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	?
how	old	it	is	?
 may 	 be 	 	 off 	 er 	 	to	 spear 	 head 	 	a	 fund 	 raise 	 r 	 	to	buy	new	gear	--	which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	to	suit	up	.
wear	a	helmet	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	prevent	a	bad	 out 	 come 	 	is	to	prevent	that	first	 in 	 jury 	 	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	my	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	,	tom	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	kim	,	i	've	 decide 	 d 	 	to	wear	a	bike	helmet	on	my	way	to	class	.	``
and	tom	 know 	 s 	 	that	that	little	bit	of	foam	in	a	bike	helmet	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	g	-	force	of	impact	by	half	.
now	i	thought	that	it	was	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	helmet	crusade	,	right	,	 th 	 is 	 	 epiph 	 any 	 	of	tom	's	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	tom	that	a	$	20	helmet	is	a	good	way	to	protect	a	$	100,000	graduate	education	.
so	,	should	vander	play	 foot 	 ball 	 	?
i	ca	n't	say	no	,	but	i	can	guarantee	that	every	time	he	 leav 	 es 	 	the	house	that	kid	's	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	helmet	--	like	to	the	car	,	or	at	school	.
so	 whet 	 her 	 	athlete	,	scholar	,	over	-	 protect 	 ed 	 	kid	,	 neuro 	 tic 	 	mom	,	or	 other 	 wise 	 	,	here	's	my	baby	,	vander	,	 re 	 mind 	 ing 	 	you	to	mind	your	matter	.
thank	you	.
