so	,	i	kind	of	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	're	in	like	the	``	cave	-	 paint 	 ing 	 	``	era	of	computer	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	.
like	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	kind	of	--	they	do	n't	go	 a 	 s 	 	deep	or	 a 	 s 	 	 emotion 	 ally 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	possibly	could	be	and	i	'd	like	to	change	all	that	.
hit	me	.
ok	.	so	i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	 inter 	 face 	 	,	right	?
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	flat	,	kind	of	rigid	.
and	ok	,	so	you	could	 s 	 ex 	 	it	up	and	like	go	to	a	much	more	 lick 	 able 	 	mac	,	you	know	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	it	's	the	kind	of	same	old	crap	we	've	had	for	the	last	,	you	know	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
like	i	think	we	 re 	 ally 	 	put	up	with	a	lot	of	crap	with	our	 computer 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	it	's	point	and	click	,	it	's	like	the	 menu 	 s 	 	,	 icon 	 s 	 	,	it	's	all	the	kind	of	same	thing	.
and	so	one	kind	of	information	space	that	i	take	inspiration	from	is	my	real	desk	.
it	's	so	much	more	subtle	,	so	much	more	visceral	--	you	know	,	what	's	visible	,	what	's	not	.
and	i	'd	like	to	 br 	 ing 	 	that	experience	to	the	 desk 	 top 	 	.
so	i	kind	of	have	a	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	bumptop	.
it	's	kind	of	like	a	new	approach	to	 desk 	 top 	 	computing	.
so	you	can	bump	 thing 	 s 	 	--	they	're	all	 physical 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	,	 manipul 	 able 	 	and	stuff	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	that	point	and	click	,	it	's	like	a	push	and	pull	,	 thing 	 s 	 	collide	 a 	 s 	 	you	'd	expect	them	.	just	like	on	my	real	desk	,	i	can	--	let	me	just	grab	these	 guy 	 s 	 	--	i	can	turn	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 pile 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	the	 fold 	 ers 	 	that	we	have	.
and	once	 thing 	 s 	 	are	in	a	pile	i	can	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	them	by	 throw 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	grid	,	or	you	know	,	flip	through	them	like	a	book	or	i	can	lay	them	out	like	a	deck	of	 card 	 s 	 	.
when	they	're	laid	out	,	i	can	pull	 thing 	 s 	 	to	new	 location 	 s 	 	or	delete	 thing 	 s 	 	or	just	 quick 	 ly 	 	sort	a	whole	pile	,	you	know	,	just	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	right	?
and	then	,	it	's	all	 smooth 	 ly 	 	 animate 	 d 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	these	 jar 	 ring 	 	 change 	 s 	 	you	see	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	if	i	want	to	add	 some 	 thing 	 	to	a	pile	,	well	,	how	do	i	do	that	?
i	just	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	it	to	the	pile	,	and	it	's	 add 	 ed 	 	right	to	the	top	.	it	's	a	kind	of	nice	way	.
 al 	 so 	 	some	of	the	stuff	we	can	do	is	,	for	these	individual	 icon 	 s 	 	we	thought	--	i	mean	,	how	can	we	play	with	the	idea	of	an	icon	,	and	push	that	further	?
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	can	do	is	make	it	 big 	 ger 	 	if	i	want	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	it	and	make	it	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	is	that	since	there	's	a	physics	 simul 	 ation 	 	running	under	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 heav 	 ier 	 	.	so	the	 light 	 er 	 	stuff	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	move	but	if	i	throw	it	at	the	 light 	 er 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	right	?
so	it	's	cute	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	like	a	subtle	channel	of	 convey 	 ing 	 	information	,	right	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	heavy	so	it	 feel 	 s 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.	so	it	's	kind	of	cool	.
 de 	 spite 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	paper	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	,	i	think	,	 valu 	 able 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
and	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	transfer	to	the	 icon 	 s 	 	in	our	system	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	to	our	 icon 	 s 	 	,	just	like	paper	,	is	crease	them	and	fold	them	,	just	like	paper	.	remember	,	you	know	,	 some 	 thing 	 	for	 lat 	 er 	 	.
or	if	you	want	to	be	 destruct 	 ive 	 	,	you	can	just	crumple	it	up	and	,	you	know	,	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	it	to	the	corner	.
 al 	 so 	 	just	like	paper	,	around	our	 work 	 space 	 	we	'll	pin	 thing 	 s 	 	up	to	the	wall	to	remember	them	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	i	can	do	the	same	thing	here	,	and	you	know	,	you	'll	see	post	-	it	 note 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	around	people	's	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	.
and	i	can	pull	them	off	when	i	want	to	work	with	them	.
so	,	one	of	the	 critic 	 ism 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	approach	to	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	that	,	you	know	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	well	my	real	desk	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 mess 	 y 	 	.	i	do	n't	want	that	mess	on	my	computer	.	``
so	one	thing	we	have	for	that	is	like	a	grid	align	,	kind	of	--	so	you	get	that	more	 tradition 	 al 	 	 desk 	 top 	 	.	 thing 	 s 	 	are	kind	of	grid	 align 	 ed 	 	.
more	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	but	you	still	have	that	kind	of	 coll 	 id 	 ing 	 	and	 bump 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	can	still	do	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	make	 shelv 	 es 	 	on	your	 desk 	 top 	 	.
let	's	just	break	 th 	 is 	 	shelf	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	that	shelf	broke	.
i	think	beyond	the	 icon 	 s 	 	,	i	think	 an 	 other 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	domain	for	 th 	 is 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	--	i	think	it	 appli 	 es 	 	to	more	than	just	 icon 	 s 	 	and	your	 desk 	 top 	 	--	but	 brow 	 s 	 ing 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	.
i	think	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	enrich	the	way	we	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	our	 photograph 	 s 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	that	kind	of	 shoe 	 box 	 	of	,	you	know	,	 photo 	 s 	 	with	your	family	on	the	kitchen	table	kind	of	thing	.
i	can	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	around	.	they	're	so	much	more	tangible	and	 touch 	 able 	 	--	and	you	know	i	can	double	-	click	on	 some 	 thing 	 	to	take	a	look	at	it	.
and	i	can	do	all	that	kind	of	same	stuff	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	.
so	i	can	pile	 thing 	 s 	 	up	,	i	can	flip	through	it	,	i	can	,	you	know	--	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	let	's	move	 th 	 is 	 	photo	to	the	back	,	let	's	delete	 th 	 is 	 	guy	here	,	and	i	think	it	's	just	a	much	more	rich	kind	of	way	of	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	your	information	.
and	that	's	bumptop	.	 thank 	 s 	 	!
