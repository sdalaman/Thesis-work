a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	had	a	chance	to	go	to	saudi	arabia	.
and	the	first	thing	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	a	muslim	was	go	to	mecca	and	visit	the	kaaba	,	the	 holi 	 est 	 	 s 	 hr 	 ine 	 	of	islam	.
and	i	did	that	;	i	put	on	my	 ritual 	 istic 	 	dress	;	i	went	to	the	holy	mosque	;	i	did	my	 pray 	 ers 	 	;	i	 observ 	 ed 	 	all	the	 ritual 	 s 	 	.
and	 mean 	 while 	 	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	all	the	 spiritual 	 ity 	 	,	there	was	one	mundane	detail	in	the	kaaba	that	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	for	me	.
there	was	no	 separat 	 ion 	 	of	 s 	 ex 	 es 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	men	and	women	 we 	 re 	 	 worship 	 ing 	 	all	together	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	together	while	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 tawa 	 f 	 	,	the	 circul 	 ar 	 	walk	around	the	kaaba	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	together	while	 pray 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	you	wonder	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	at	all	,	you	have	to	see	the	rest	of	saudi	arabia	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	country	which	is	 strict 	 ly 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	between	the	 s 	 ex 	 es 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	men	,	you	are	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	in	the	same	physical	space	with	women	.
and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	funny	way	.
i	left	the	kaaba	to	eat	 some 	 thing 	 	in	 down 	 town 	 	mecca	.
i	headed	to	the	 near 	 est 	 	burger	king	restaurant	.
and	i	went	there	--	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	there	was	a	male	section	,	which	was	 care 	 fully 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	the	female	section	.
and	i	had	to	pay	,	order	and	eat	at	the	male	section	.
``	it	's	funny	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	you	can	mingle	with	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	at	the	holy	kaaba	,	but	not	at	the	burger	king	.	``
 quit 	 e 	 	 iron 	 ic 	 	.
 iron 	 ic 	 	,	and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	think	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	kaaba	and	the	 ritual 	 s 	 	around	it	are	 re 	 lic 	 s 	 	from	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	phase	of	islam	,	that	of	prophet	muhammad	.
and	if	there	was	a	big	 emphas 	 is 	 	at	the	time	to	 separat 	 e 	 	men	from	women	,	the	 ritual 	 s 	 	around	the	kaaba	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	designed	 accord 	 ing 	 ly 	 	.
but	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	that	was	not	an	issue	at	the	time	.
so	the	 ritual 	 s 	 	came	that	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	think	,	 confirm 	 ed 	 	by	the	fact	that	the	 s 	 e 	 clusion 	 	of	women	in	creating	a	 divid 	 ed 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	 al 	 so 	 	do	not	find	in	the	koran	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	core	of	islam	--	the	divine	core	of	islam	that	all	muslims	,	and	 equal 	 ly 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	.
and	i	think	it	's	not	an	accident	that	you	do	n't	find	 th 	 is 	 	idea	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	origin	of	islam	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 scholar 	 s 	 	who	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	islamic	thought	--	muslim	 scholar 	 s 	 	or	westerners	--	think	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	practice	of	 divid 	 ing 	 	men	and	women	 physical 	 ly 	 	came	 a 	 s 	 	a	 lat 	 er 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	islam	,	 a 	 s 	 	muslims	 adopt 	 ed 	 	some	 pre 	 exist 	 ing 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	and	 tradition 	 s 	 	of	the	middle	east	.
 s 	 e 	 clusion 	 	of	women	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 by 	 zantine 	 	and	persian	practice	,	and	muslims	 adopt 	 ed 	 	that	and	made	that	a	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
what	we	call	 to 	 day 	 	islamic	law	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	islamic	culture	--	and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	islamic	 culture 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	;	the	one	in	saudi	arabia	is	much	different	from	where	i	come	from	in	istanbul	or	 tur 	 key 	 	.
but	still	,	if	you	're	going	to	speak	about	a	muslim	culture	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	core	,	the	divine	 mess 	 age 	 	,	which	 beg 	 an 	 	the	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	but	then	 man 	 y 	 	 tradition 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 practice 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	on	top	of	it	.
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	 tradition 	 s 	 	of	the	middle	east	--	 med 	 ieval 	 	 tradition 	 s 	 	.
and	there	are	two	 import 	 ant 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	,	or	two	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	,	to	take	from	that	 re 	 ality 	 	.
first	of	all	,	muslims	--	 p 	 ious 	 	,	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	 believ 	 ing 	 	muslims	who	want	to	be	loyal	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	should	not	 cl 	 ing 	 	onto	 every 	 thing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	,	 think 	 ing 	 	that	that	's	 divine 	 ly 	 	 man 	 d 	 ated 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	some	 thing 	 s 	 	are	bad	 tradition 	 s 	 	and	they	need	to	be	 change 	 d 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	the	westerners	who	look	at	islamic	culture	and	see	some	 trou 	 bling 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	should	not	 read 	 ily 	 	conclude	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	islam	ordains	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	a	middle	eastern	culture	that	 be 	 came 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	with	islam	.
there	is	a	practice	 call 	 ed 	 	female	 circum 	 cis 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	 horr 	 ible 	 	.
it	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	operation	to	 depriv 	 e 	 	women	of	sexual	pleasure	.
and	westerners	,	europeans	or	americans	,	who	did	n't	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	before	 face 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	practice	 with 	 in 	 	some	of	the	muslim	 commun 	 ities 	 	who	 migr 	 ated 	 	from	north	africa	.
and	they	've	thought	,	``	oh	,	what	a	 horr 	 ible 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	is	which	ordains	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.	``
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	when	you	look	at	female	 circum 	 cis 	 ion 	 	,	you	see	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	islam	,	it	's	just	a	north	african	practice	,	which	 pre 	 date 	 s 	 	islam	.
it	was	there	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	 quit 	 e 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	some	muslims	do	practice	that	.
the	muslims	in	north	africa	,	not	in	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	the	non	-	muslim	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	north	africa	--	the	 anim 	 ists 	 	,	even	some	christians	and	even	a	jewish	tribe	in	north	africa	is	known	to	practice	female	 circum 	 cis 	 ion 	 	.
so	what	might	look	like	a	problem	 with 	 in 	 	islamic	faith	might	turn	out	to	be	a	tradition	that	muslims	have	 sub 	 scribed 	 	to	.
the	same	thing	can	be	 s 	 aid 	 	for	honor	 kill 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	 re 	 current 	 	theme	in	the	western	media	--	and	which	is	,	of	course	,	a	 horr 	 ible 	 	tradition	.
and	we	see	 tru 	 ly 	 	in	some	muslim	 commun 	 ities 	 	that	tradition	.
but	in	the	non	-	muslim	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	the	middle	east	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	some	christian	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	eastern	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	you	see	the	same	practice	.
we	had	a	tragic	case	of	an	honor	 kill 	 ing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 tur 	 key 	 	's	armenian	community	just	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
now	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	about	general	culture	,	but	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 politic 	 al 	 	culture	and	 whet 	 her 	 	 liber 	 ty 	 	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	 appreciate 	 d 	 	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	there	's	an	 author 	 itarian 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	culture	in	which	the	state	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	impose	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
and	it	is	no	secret	that	 man 	 y 	 	islamic	 move 	 ments 	 	in	the	middle	east	tend	to	be	 author 	 itarian 	 	,	and	some	of	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	``	islamic	 regime 	 s 	 	``	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	saudi	arabia	,	iran	and	the	worst	case	was	the	taliban	in	afghanistan	--	they	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	 author 	 itarian 	 	.	no	doubt	about	that	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	saudi	arabia	there	is	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	religious	police	.
and	the	religious	police	 impose 	 s 	 	the	 suppose 	 d 	 	islamic	way	of	life	on	every	citizen	,	by	force	--	like	women	are	 force 	 d 	 	to	cover	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	--	wear	the	hijab	,	the	islamic	head	cover	.
now	that	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 author 	 itarian 	 	,	and	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	much	critical	of	.
but	when	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	non	-	muslim	,	or	the	non	-	islamic	-	minded	 act 	 ors 	 	in	the	same	 geo 	 graphy 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 behav 	 ed 	 	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	problem	 may 	 be 	 	lies	in	the	 politic 	 al 	 	culture	of	the	whole	region	,	not	just	islam	.
let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	in	 tur 	 key 	 	where	i	come	from	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hyper	-	secular	 re 	 public 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	we	used	to	have	what	i	call	 secular 	 ism 	 	police	,	which	would	guard	the	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	against	 veil 	 ed 	 	 student 	 s 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	they	would	force	 student 	 s 	 	to	 un 	 cover 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	forcing	people	to	 un 	 cover 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	head	is	 a 	 s 	 	 tyrann 	 ical 	 	 a 	 s 	 	forcing	them	to	cover	it	.
it	should	be	the	citizen	's	decision	.
but	when	i	saw	that	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 may 	 be 	 	the	problem	is	just	an	 author 	 itarian 	 	culture	in	the	region	,	and	some	muslims	have	 be 	 en 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	that	.
but	the	secular	-	minded	people	can	be	 influence 	 d 	 	by	that	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	a	problem	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	culture	,	and	we	have	to	think	about	how	to	change	that	 politic 	 al 	 	culture	.	``
now	these	are	some	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	i	had	in	mind	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	to	write	a	book	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	i	will	make	a	research	about	how	islam	 actual 	 ly 	 	came	to	be	what	it	is	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	what	 road 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	taken	and	what	 road 	 s 	 	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	taken	.	``
the	name	of	the	book	is	``	islam	 with 	 out 	 	 extrem 	 es 	 	:	a	muslim	case	for	 liber 	 ty 	 	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 sub 	 title 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	islamic	tradition	and	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	islamic	thought	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	individual	 liber 	 ty 	 	,	and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	find	what	are	the	 strength 	 s 	 	with	regard	to	individual	 liber 	 ty 	 	.
and	there	are	 strength 	 s 	 	in	islamic	tradition	.
islam	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mono 	 the 	 istic 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	which	defined	man	 a 	 s 	 	a	 respons 	 ible 	 	agent	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	 create 	 d 	 	the	idea	of	the	individual	in	the	middle	east	and	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	it	from	the	 commun 	 itarianism 	 	,	the	 collect 	 ivism 	 	of	the	tribe	.
you	can	 der 	 ive 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	from	that	.
but	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	that	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	saw	 problem 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	islamic	tradition	.
but	one	thing	was	 cur 	 ious 	 	:	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	turn	out	to	be	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 emerge 	 d 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	not	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	divine	core	of	islam	,	the	koran	,	but	from	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 tradition 	 s 	 	and	 mental 	 ities 	 	,	or	the	 interpret 	 ations 	 	of	the	koran	that	muslims	made	in	the	middle	 age 	 s 	 	.
the	koran	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 con 	 d 	 one 	 	 s 	 ton 	 ing 	 	.
there	is	no	 punish 	 ment 	 	on	 a 	 post 	 a 	 s 	 y 	 	.
there	is	no	 punish 	 ment 	 	on	personal	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 drink 	 ing 	 	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	which	make	islamic	law	,	the	 trou 	 bling 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	islamic	law	,	 we 	 re 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 interpret 	 ations 	 	of	islam	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	muslims	can	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	well	,	the	core	of	our	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	here	to	stay	with	us	.
it	's	our	faith	,	and	we	will	be	loyal	to	it	.
but	we	can	change	how	it	was	 interpret 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 interpret 	 ed 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	time	and	milieu	in	the	middle	 age 	 s 	 	.
now	we	are	living	in	a	different	world	with	different	 value 	 s 	 	and	different	 politic 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.	``
that	 interpret 	 ation 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	possible	and	 feas 	 ible 	 	.
now	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	 think 	 ing 	 	that	way	,	we	would	be	in	trouble	.
but	that	's	not	the	case	at	all	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	from	the	19th	century	on	,	there	's	a	whole	 re 	 vision 	 ist 	 	,	 reform 	 ist 	 	--	 what 	 ever 	 	you	call	it	--	tradition	,	a	trend	in	islamic	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	 intellectual 	 s 	 	or	 state 	 s 	 men 	 	of	the	19th	century	,	and	 lat 	 er 	 	,	20th	century	,	which	 look 	 ed 	 	at	europe	 bas 	 ically 	 	and	saw	that	europe	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	admire	,	like	science	and	technology	.
but	not	just	that	;	 al 	 so 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	parliament	,	the	idea	of	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	the	idea	of	equal	 citizen 	 ship 	 	.
these	muslim	 think 	 ers 	 	and	 intellectual 	 s 	 	and	 state 	 s 	 men 	 	of	the	19th	century	 look 	 ed 	 	at	europe	,	saw	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	we	have	these	 thing 	 s 	 	?	``
and	they	 look 	 ed 	 	back	at	islamic	tradition	,	they	saw	that	there	are	 problem 	 atic 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	,	but	they	're	not	the	core	of	the	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	so	 may 	 be 	 	they	can	be	re	-	 under 	 stood 	 	,	and	the	koran	can	be	 re 	 read 	 	in	the	modern	world	.
that	trend	is	 general 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	islamic	 modern 	 ism 	 	,	and	it	was	 advance 	 d 	 	by	 intellectual 	 s 	 	and	 state 	 s 	 men 	 	,	not	just	 a 	 s 	 	an	intellectual	idea	 th 	 ough 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	program	.
and	that	's	why	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	19th	century	the	ottoman	empire	,	which	then	 cover 	 ed 	 	the	whole	middle	east	,	made	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 reform 	 s 	 	--	 reform 	 s 	 	like	giving	christians	and	jews	an	equal	 citizen 	 ship 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	,	 accept 	 ing 	 	a	 constit 	 ution 	 	,	 accept 	 ing 	 	a	 represent 	 ative 	 	parliament	,	 advanc 	 ing 	 	the	idea	of	 free 	 dom 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
and	that	's	why	the	ottoman	empire	in	 it 	 s 	 	last	 decade 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	proto	-	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	a	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	,	and	 free 	 dom 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	value	at	the	time	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	arab	world	,	there	was	what	the	great	arab	historian	albert	hourani	 define 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	liberal	age	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	book	,	``	arabic	thought	in	the	liberal	age	,	``	and	the	liberal	age	,	he	 define 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	19th	century	and	early	20th	century	.
 quit 	 e 	 	 not 	 ably 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	trend	in	the	early	20th	century	among	islamic	 think 	 ers 	 	and	 state 	 s 	 men 	 	and	 theo 	 log 	 ians 	 	.
but	there	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	pattern	in	the	rest	of	the	20th	century	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	see	a	sharp	decline	in	 th 	 is 	 	islamic	 modern 	 ist 	 	line	.
and	in	place	of	that	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	islamism	 grow 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ideo 	 logy 	 	which	is	 author 	 itarian 	 	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 strid 	 ent 	 	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	anti	-	western	,	and	which	 want 	 s 	 	to	shape	 socie 	 ty 	 	based	on	a	 utopia 	 n 	 	vision	.
so	islamism	is	the	 problem 	 atic 	 	idea	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	20th	century	islamic	world	.
and	even	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	islamism	led	to	 terror 	 ism 	 	in	the	name	of	islam	--	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	practice	that	i	think	is	against	islam	,	but	some	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 extrem 	 ists 	 	did	not	think	that	way	.
but	there	is	a	 cur 	 ious 	 	question	:	if	islamic	 modern 	 ism 	 	was	so	popular	in	the	19th	and	early	20th	centuries	,	why	did	islamism	 be 	 come 	 	so	popular	in	the	rest	of	the	20th	century	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	question	,	i	think	,	which	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 discuss 	 ed 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
and	in	my	book	,	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	that	question	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	you	do	n't	need	to	be	a	rocket	scientist	to	understand	that	.
you	just	look	at	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	20th	century	,	and	you	see	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	a	lot	.
the	 con 	 text 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
in	the	19th	century	,	when	muslims	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	europe	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	more	self	-	confident	.
in	the	early	20th	century	,	with	the	fall	of	the	ottoman	empire	,	the	whole	middle	east	was	 colon 	 ized 	 	.
and	when	you	have	 colon 	 ization 	 	what	do	you	have	?
you	have	anti	-	 colon 	 ization 	 	.
so	europe	is	not	just	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	now	to	 emul 	 ate 	 	;	it	's	an	 ene 	 my 	 	to	fight	and	to	resist	.
so	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	sharp	decline	in	liberal	 idea 	 s 	 	in	the	muslim	world	,	and	what	you	see	is	more	of	a	defensive	,	rigid	,	 re 	 action 	 ary 	 	 s 	 train 	 	,	which	led	to	arab	 social 	 ism 	 	,	arab	 national 	 ism 	 	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	to	the	islamist	 ideo 	 logy 	 	.
and	when	the	colonial	period	 end 	 ed 	 	,	what	you	had	in	place	of	that	was	,	 general 	 ly 	 	,	secular	 dictator 	 s 	 	,	which	say	they	're	a	country	,	but	did	not	 br 	 ing 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	to	the	country	,	and	 establish 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 dictator 	 ship 	 	.
and	i	think	the	west	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	some	 power 	 s 	 	in	the	west	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	made	the	 mistak 	 e 	 	of	 support 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	secular	 dictator 	 s 	 	,	 think 	 ing 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	more	 help 	 ful 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	.
but	the	fact	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 dictator 	 s 	 	 suppress 	 ed 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	country	and	 suppress 	 ed 	 	islamic	 group 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	country	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	the	islamists	much	more	 strid 	 ent 	 	.
so	in	the	20th	century	,	you	had	 th 	 is 	 	 vic 	 ious 	 	cycle	in	the	arab	world	where	you	have	a	 dictator 	 ship 	 	 suppress 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	people	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	islamic	-	 p 	 ious 	 	,	and	they	're	 react 	 ing 	 	in	 re 	 action 	 ary 	 	ways	.
there	was	one	country	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	which	was	able	to	 es 	 cape 	 	or	stay	away	from	that	 vic 	 ious 	 	cycle	.
and	that	's	the	country	where	i	come	from	;	that	's	 tur 	 key 	 	.
 tur 	 key 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	 colon 	 ized 	 	,	so	it	 remain 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	nation	after	the	fall	of	the	ottoman	empire	.
that	's	one	thing	to	remember	.
they	did	not	share	the	same	anti	-	colonial	hype	that	you	can	find	in	some	other	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	region	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	 tur 	 key 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	than	any	of	the	 count 	 ries 	 	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
in	1950	,	 tur 	 key 	 	had	the	first	free	and	fair	 election 	 s 	 	,	which	 end 	 ed 	 	the	more	 auto 	 cratic 	 	secular	regime	,	which	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 tur 	 key 	 	.
and	the	 p 	 ious 	 	muslims	in	 tur 	 key 	 	saw	that	they	can	change	the	 politic 	 al 	 	system	by	 vot 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	compatible	with	islam	,	compatible	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 value 	 s 	 	,	and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 support 	 ive 	 	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
that	's	an	experience	that	not	every	other	muslim	nation	in	the	middle	east	had	 un 	 til 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	past	two	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	 global 	 ization 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	market	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	rise	of	a	middle	-	class	,	we	in	 tur 	 key 	 	see	what	i	define	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 birth 	 	of	islamic	 modern 	 ism 	 	.
now	there	's	the	more	urban	middle	-	class	 p 	 ious 	 	muslims	who	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	tradition	and	see	that	there	are	some	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	tradition	,	and	they	understand	that	they	need	to	be	 change 	 d 	 	and	 question 	 ed 	 	and	 reform 	 ed 	 	.
and	they	look	at	europe	,	and	they	see	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	to	follow	.
they	see	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	to	take	some	inspiration	from	.
that	's	why	the	e.u	.	process	,	 tur 	 key 	 	's	effort	to	join	the	e.u	.	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 tur 	 key 	 	by	the	islamic	-	 p 	 ious 	 	,	while	some	secular	 nation 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	against	that	.
well	that	process	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	little	bit	 blur 	 red 	 	by	the	fact	that	not	all	europeans	are	that	 wel 	 coming 	 	--	but	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
but	the	pro	-	e.u	.	sentiment	in	 tur 	 key 	 	in	the	past	decade	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 al 	 most 	 	an	islamic	cause	and	 support 	 ed 	 	by	the	islamic	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	the	secular	 liberal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	of	course	.
and	 thank 	 s 	 	to	that	,	 tur 	 key 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 reason 	 ably 	 	create	a	success	story	in	which	islam	and	the	most	 p 	 ious 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	islam	have	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	game	,	and	even	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	and	economic	advance	of	the	country	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	inspiring	 ex 	 ample 	 	right	now	for	some	of	the	islamic	 move 	 ments 	 	or	some	of	the	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	arab	world	.
you	must	have	all	 s 	 een 	 	the	arab	spring	,	which	 beg 	 an 	 	in	tunis	and	in	egypt	.
and	arab	 masse 	 s 	 	just	 revolt 	 ed 	 	against	 the 	 ir 	 	 dictator 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 free 	 dom 	 	.
and	they	did	not	turn	out	to	be	the	islamist	 bo 	 ogy 	 man 	 	that	the	 dictator 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	using	to	 just 	 ify 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	regime	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	that	``	we	want	 free 	 dom 	 	;	we	want	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
we	are	muslim	 believ 	 ers 	 	,	but	we	want	to	be	living	 a 	 s 	 	free	people	in	free	 socie 	 ties 	 	.	``
of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	long	road	.
 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	not	an	 over 	 night 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 	;	it	's	a	process	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	promising	era	in	the	muslim	world	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	islamic	 modern 	 ism 	 	which	 beg 	 an 	 	in	the	19th	century	,	but	which	had	a	 set 	 back 	 	in	the	20th	century	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 trouble 	 s 	 	of	the	muslim	world	,	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 re 	 birth 	 	.
and	i	think	the	 get 	 away 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	from	that	would	be	that	islam	,	 de 	 spite 	 	some	of	the	 skeptic 	 s 	 	in	the	west	,	 ha 	 s 	 	the	potential	in	 it 	 self 	 	to	create	 it 	 s 	 	own	way	to	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	create	 it 	 s 	 	own	way	to	 liberal 	 ism 	 	,	create	 it 	 s 	 	own	way	to	 free 	 dom 	 	.
they	just	should	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	work	for	that	.
 thank 	 s 	 	so	much	.
