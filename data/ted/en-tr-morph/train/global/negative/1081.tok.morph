 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	i	was	raised	by	native	hawaiian	 elder 	 s 	 	--	three	old	women	who	took	care	of	me	while	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	.
the	year	is	1963	.
we	're	at	the	ocean	.
it	's	 t 	 wi 	 light 	 	.
we	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	 ris 	 ing 	 	of	the	 star 	 s 	 	and	the	shifting	of	the	 tide 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	stretch	of	beach	we	know	so	well	.
the	smooth	 stone 	 s 	 	on	the	sand	are	familiar	to	us	.
if	you	saw	these	women	on	the	street	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 fad 	 ed 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	you	might	dismiss	them	 a 	 s 	 	poor	and	simple	.
that	would	be	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
these	women	are	 descend 	 ants 	 	of	polynesian	 navig 	 ators 	 	,	trained	in	the	old	ways	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 elder 	 s 	 	,	and	now	they	're	 pass 	 ing 	 	it	on	to	me	.
they	teach	me	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 wind 	 s 	 	and	the	 rain 	 s 	 	,	of	 astro 	 nomy 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	a	 genea 	 logy 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	new	moon	on	the	horizon	.
hawaiians	say	it	's	a	good	night	for	 fish 	 ing 	 	.
they	begin	to	chant	.
[	hawaiian	chant	]	when	they	finish	,	they	 s 	 it 	 	in	a	circle	and	ask	me	to	come	to	join	them	.
they	want	to	teach	me	about	my	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
i	thought	every	seven	-	year	-	old	went	through	 th 	 is 	 	.
``	baby	girl	,	 some 	 day 	 	the	world	will	be	in	trouble	.
people	will	forget	 the 	 ir 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
it	will	take	 elder 	 s 	 	'	 voice 	 s 	 	from	the	far	 corner 	 s 	 	of	the	world	to	call	the	world	 in 	 to 	 	balance	.
you	will	go	far	away	.
it	will	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	be	a	 lone 	 ly 	 	road	.
we	will	not	be	there	.
but	you	will	look	 in 	 to 	 	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	 seem 	 ing 	 	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	and	you	will	 recogn 	 ize 	 	your	 oh 	 ana 	 	,	your	family	.
and	it	will	take	all	of	you	.
it	will	take	all	of	you	.	``
these	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	hold	onto	all	my	life	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	idea	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 al 	 one 	 	 terr 	 ifies 	 	me	.
the	year	is	2007	.
i	'm	on	a	remote	 is 	 land 	 	in	micronesia	.
satawal	is	one	half	-	mile	long	by	one	mile	wide	.
it	's	the	home	of	my	mentor	.
his	name	is	pius	mau	piailug	.
mau	is	a	palu	,	a	 navig 	 ator 	 	priest	.
he	's	 al 	 so 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	wave	finder	in	the	world	.
there	are	 few 	 er 	 	than	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	palu	left	on	 th 	 is 	 	 is 	 land 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	tradition	is	so	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	that	these	 marin 	 ers 	 	 s 	 ailed 	 	three	million	square	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	use	of	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
they	could	synthesize	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	nature	using	the	 ris 	 ing 	 	and	setting	of	 star 	 s 	 	,	the	sequence	and	direction	of	 wave 	 s 	 	,	the	flight	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	certain	 bird 	 s 	 	.
even	the	 s 	 light 	 est 	 	hint	of	color	on	the	 under 	 bel 	 ly 	 	of	a	cloud	would	inform	them	and	help	them	 navig 	 ate 	 	with	the	 keen 	 est 	 	 accu 	 racy 	 	.
when	western	 scientist 	 s 	 	would	join	mau	on	the	canoe	and	watch	him	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	hull	,	it	 appear 	 ed 	 	that	an	old	man	was	going	to	rest	.
in	fact	,	the	hull	of	the	canoe	is	the	womb	of	the	vessel	.
it	is	the	most	accurate	place	to	feel	the	rhythm	and	sequence	and	direction	of	 wave 	 s 	 	.
mau	was	,	in	fact	,	 gather 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 	data	using	his	entire	body	.
it	's	what	he	had	 be 	 en 	 	trained	to	do	since	he	was	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
now	science	may	dismiss	 th 	 is 	 	 method 	 ology 	 	,	but	polynesian	 navig 	 ators 	 	use	it	 to 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 provide 	 s 	 	them	an	accurate	 determi 	 nation 	 	of	the	angle	and	direction	of	 the 	 ir 	 	vessel	.
the	palu	 al 	 so 	 	had	an	 un 	 can 	 ny 	 	ability	to	 fore 	 cast 	 	weather	 condition 	 s 	 	 day 	 s 	 	in	advance	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	'd	be	with	mau	on	a	cloud	-	 cover 	 ed 	 	night	and	we	'd	 s 	 it 	 	at	the	 eastern 	 most 	 	coast	of	the	 is 	 land 	 	,	and	he	would	look	out	,	and	then	he	would	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	go	.	``
he	saw	that	first	glint	of	light	--	he	 k 	 new 	 	what	the	weather	was	going	to	be	three	 day 	 s 	 	from	now	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	,	 intellectual 	 ly 	 	and	 scientific 	 ally 	 	,	are	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	and	they	are	so	relevant	for	these	 time 	 s 	 	that	we	are	in	when	we	are	 rid 	 ing 	 	out	 storm 	 s 	 	.
