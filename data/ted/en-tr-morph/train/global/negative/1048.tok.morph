so	the	awesome	story	:	it	 begin 	 s 	 	about	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	my	mom	and	my	dad	came	to	canada	.
my	mom	left	nairobi	,	kenya	.
my	dad	left	a	small	village	 out 	 side 	 	of	amritsar	,	india	.
and	they	got	here	in	the	late	1960s	.
they	 settl 	 ed 	 	in	a	 sha 	 dy 	 	suburb	about	an	hour	east	of	toronto	,	and	they	 settl 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	life	.
they	saw	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 dent 	 ist 	 	,	they	ate	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 ham 	 burger 	 	,	and	they	had	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 kid 	 s 	 	.
my	sister	and	i	grew	up	here	,	and	we	had	quiet	,	happy	 child 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
we	had	close	family	,	good	 friend 	 s 	 	,	a	quiet	street	.
we	grew	up	taking	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	my	 parent 	 s 	 	could	n't	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	when	they	grew	up	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	power	 al 	 ways 	 	on	in	our	 house 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 school 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	street	and	 hospital 	 s 	 	down	the	road	and	 pop 	 s 	 icles 	 	in	the	 back 	 yard 	 	.
we	grew	up	,	and	we	grew	 old 	 er 	 	.
i	went	to	high	school	.
i	 graduate 	 d 	 	.
i	 move 	 d 	 	out	of	the	house	,	i	got	a	job	,	i	found	a	girl	,	i	 settl 	 ed 	 	down	--	and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	bad	sitcom	or	a	cat	stevens	'	song	--	but	life	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
life	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
2006	was	a	great	year	.
under	clear	blue	 ski 	 es 	 	in	july	in	the	wine	region	of	ontario	,	i	got	married	,	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	150	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	.
2007	was	a	great	year	.
i	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	school	,	and	i	went	on	a	road	trip	with	two	of	my	 close 	 st 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
here	's	a	picture	of	me	and	my	friend	,	chris	,	on	the	coast	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	ocean	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	saw	 seal 	 s 	 	out	of	our	car	window	,	and	we	 pull 	 ed 	 	over	to	take	a	quick	picture	of	them	and	then	 block 	 ed 	 	them	with	our	giant	 head 	 s 	 	.
so	you	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	them	,	but	it	was	 breath 	 taking 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	me	.
2008	and	2009	 we 	 re 	 	a	little	 tough 	 er 	 	.
i	know	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 tough 	 er 	 	for	a	lot	of	people	,	not	just	me	.
first	of	all	,	the	news	was	so	heavy	.
it	's	still	heavy	now	,	and	it	was	heavy	before	that	,	but	when	you	 flip 	 ped 	 	open	a	 news 	 paper 	 	,	when	you	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	the	tv	,	it	was	about	ice	 cap 	 s 	 	 melt 	 ing 	 	,	 war 	 s 	 	going	on	around	the	world	,	 earth 	 quake 	 s 	 	,	 hurricane 	 s 	 	and	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	was	 wo 	 b 	 bling 	 	on	the	 br 	 ink 	 	of	collapse	,	and	then	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	did	collapse	,	and	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	our	 home 	 s 	 	,	or	our	 job 	 s 	 	,	or	our	 retire 	 ments 	 	,	or	our	 livelihood 	 s 	 	.
2008	,	2009	 we 	 re 	 	heavy	 year 	 s 	 	for	me	for	 an 	 other 	 	reason	,	too	.
i	was	going	through	a	lot	of	personal	 problem 	 s 	 	at	the	time	.
my	marriage	was	n't	going	well	,	and	we	just	 we 	 re 	 	growing	further	and	further	 a 	 part 	 	.
one	day	my	wife	came	home	from	work	and	 summon 	 ed 	 	the	courage	,	through	a	lot	of	 tear 	 s 	 	,	to	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	honest	conversation	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	love	you	 any 	 more 	 	,	``	and	it	was	one	of	the	most	 pain 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	i	'd	ever	heard	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	most	 heart 	 break 	 ing 	 	thing	i	'd	ever	heard	,	 un 	 til 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	heard	 some 	 thing 	 	even	more	 heart 	 break 	 ing 	 	.
my	friend	chris	,	who	i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	a	picture	of	,	had	 be 	 en 	 	 batt 	 ling 	 	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	for	some	time	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 live 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	,	you	know	how	 challeng 	 ing 	 	it	can	be	.
i	spoke	to	him	on	the	phone	at	10:30	p.m	.
on	a	sunday	night	.
we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	tv	show	we	 watch 	 ed 	 	that	 even 	 ing 	 	.
and	monday	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	found	out	that	he	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	he	took	his	own	life	.
and	it	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	heavy	time	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	these	dark	 cloud 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 circl 	 ing 	 	me	,	and	i	was	 find 	 ing 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	to	think	of	 any 	 thing 	 	good	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	a	way	to	focus	on	the	positive	 some 	 how 	 	.
so	i	came	home	from	work	one	night	,	and	i	 log 	 ged 	 	onto	the	computer	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	up	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	1000awesomethings.com	.
i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	 my 	 self 	 	of	the	simple	,	universal	,	little	 pleasure 	 s 	 	that	we	all	love	,	but	we	just	do	n't	talk	about	 en 	 ough 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	waiters	and	 wait 	 re 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	who	 br 	 ing 	 	you	free	 re 	 fill 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	the	first	table	to	get	 call 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	 d 	 inner 	 	buffet	at	a	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	 wear 	 ing 	 	warm	 under 	 wear 	 	from	just	out	of	the	 dry 	 er 	 	,	or	when	 cash 	 ier 	 s 	 	open	up	a	new	check	-	out	lane	at	the	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	and	you	get	to	be	first	in	line	--	even	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	last	at	the	other	line	,	swoop	right	in	there	.
and	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	over	time	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	 my 	 self 	 	in	a	better	mood	.
i	mean	,	50,000	 blog 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ed 	 	a	day	,	and	so	my	blog	was	just	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	50,000	.
and	 no 	 body 	 	read	it	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	my	mom	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	should	say	that	my	traffic	did	skyrocket	and	go	up	by	100	percent	when	she	 forward 	 ed 	 	it	to	my	dad	.
and	then	i	got	 excit 	 ed 	 	when	it	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 hit 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	when	it	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 dozen 	 s 	 	and	then	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	then	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	then	 million 	 s 	 	.
it	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	.
and	then	i	got	a	phone	call	,	and	the	voice	at	the	other	end	of	the	line	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	've	just	won	the	best	blog	in	the	world	 a 	 ward 	 	.	``
i	was	like	,	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	fake	.
which	african	country	do	you	want	me	to	wire	all	my	money	to	?
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	on	a	plane	,	and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 walk 	 ing 	 	a	red	carpet	between	sarah	silverman	and	jimmy	fallon	and	martha	stewart	.
and	i	went	 on 	 stage 	 	to	accept	a	webby	 a 	 ward 	 	for	best	blog	.
and	the	surprise	and	just	the	 amaze 	 ment 	 	of	that	was	 on 	 ly 	 	 over 	 shadow 	 ed 	 	by	my	return	to	toronto	,	when	,	in	my	 in 	 box 	 	,	10	 liter 	 ary 	 	 agent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	me	to	talk	about	 put 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	book	.
flash	-	forward	to	the	next	year	and	``	the	book	of	awesome	``	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 en 	 	number	one	on	the	 best 	 seller 	 	list	for	20	straight	 week 	 s 	 	.
but	look	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	three	 thing 	 s 	 	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	you	the	awesome	story	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	with	you	the	three	 a 	 s 	 	of	awesome	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	a	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	thought	.
so	let	's	talk	about	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 a 	 s 	 	.
over	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	have	n't	had	that	much	time	to	 re 	 ally 	 	think	.
but	 late 	 ly 	 	i	have	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	take	a	step	back	and	ask	 my 	 self 	 	:	``	what	is	it	over	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	that	 help 	 ed 	 	me	grow	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	grow	 my 	 self 	 	?	``
and	i	've	 summarize 	 d 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	for	me	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	three	 a 	 s 	 	.
they	are	attitude	,	 aware 	 ness 	 	and	 authentic 	 ity 	 	.
i	'd	love	to	just	talk	about	each	one	 brief 	 ly 	 	.
so	attitude	:	look	,	we	're	all	going	to	get	 lump 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	all	going	to	get	 bump 	 s 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	us	can	predict	the	future	,	but	we	do	know	one	thing	about	it	and	that	's	that	it	ai	n't	gon	na	go	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	plan	.
we	will	all	have	high	 high 	 s 	 	and	big	 day 	 s 	 	and	proud	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	on	 gradu 	 ation 	 	 stage 	 s 	 	,	father	-	daughter	 dance 	 s 	 	at	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 health 	 y 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	 screech 	 ing 	 	in	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	room	,	but	between	 t 	 hose 	 	high	 high 	 s 	 	,	we	may	 al 	 so 	 	have	some	 lump 	 s 	 	and	some	 bump 	 s 	 	too	.
it	's	 s 	 ad 	 	,	and	it	's	not	 pleas 	 ant 	 	to	talk	about	,	but	your	husband	might	 leav 	 e 	 	you	,	your	girlfriend	could	cheat	,	your	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	might	be	more	serious	than	you	thought	,	or	your	dog	could	get	hit	by	a	car	on	the	street	.
it	's	not	a	happy	thought	,	but	your	 kid 	 s 	 	could	get	 mix 	 ed 	 	up	in	 gang 	 s 	 	or	bad	 scene 	 s 	 	.
your	mom	could	get	cancer	,	your	dad	could	get	mean	.
and	there	are	 time 	 s 	 	in	life	when	you	will	be	 to 	 s 	 s 	 ed 	 	in	the	well	,	too	,	with	 twist 	 s 	 	in	your	stomach	and	with	 hole 	 s 	 	in	your	heart	,	and	when	that	bad	news	 wash 	 es 	 	over	you	,	and	when	that	pain	 sponge 	 s 	 	and	 soak 	 s 	 	in	,	i	just	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	you	feel	like	you	've	 al 	 ways 	 	got	two	 choice 	 s 	 	.
one	,	you	can	swirl	and	twirl	and	gloom	and	doom	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	or	two	,	you	can	 griev 	 e 	 	and	then	face	the	future	with	 new 	 ly 	 	sober	 eye 	 s 	 	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	a	great	attitude	is	about	 choos 	 ing 	 	option	number	two	,	and	 choos 	 ing 	 	,	no	matter	how	difficult	it	is	,	no	matter	what	pain	 hit 	 s 	 	you	,	 choos 	 ing 	 	to	move	forward	and	move	on	and	take	baby	 step 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
the	second	``	a	``	is	 aware 	 ness 	 	.
i	love	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	with	three	year	-	olds	.
i	love	the	way	that	they	see	the	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	world	for	the	first	time	.
i	love	the	way	that	they	can	 star 	 e 	 	at	a	bug	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	 side 	 walk 	 	.
i	love	the	way	that	they	'll	 star 	 e 	 	 s 	 lack 	 	-	jawed	at	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 base 	 ball 	 	game	with	wide	 eye 	 s 	 	and	a	mitt	on	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	,	 soak 	 ing 	 	in	the	crack	of	the	bat	and	the	crunch	of	the	 peanut 	 s 	 	and	the	smell	of	the	 hot 	 dog 	 s 	 	.
i	love	the	way	that	they	'll	 s 	 pend 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	 pick 	 ing 	 	 dan 	 del 	 ions 	 	in	the	 back 	 yard 	 	and	 put 	 ting 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	nice	 center 	 piece 	 	for	 thank 	 s 	 giving 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	.
i	love	the	way	that	they	see	the	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	world	for	the	first	time	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	a	sense	of	 aware 	 ness 	 	is	just	about	 em 	 bracing 	 	your	inner	three	year	-	old	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	all	used	to	be	three	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
that	three	-	year	-	old	boy	is	still	part	of	you	.
that	three	-	year	-	old	girl	is	still	part	of	you	.
they	're	in	there	.
and	 be 	 ing 	 	aware	is	just	about	 remember 	 ing 	 	that	you	saw	 every 	 thing 	 	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	for	the	first	time	once	,	too	.
so	there	was	a	time	when	it	was	your	first	time	ever	hitting	a	string	of	green	 light 	 s 	 	on	the	way	home	from	work	.
there	was	the	first	time	you	 walk 	 ed 	 	by	the	open	door	of	a	 bake 	 ry 	 	and	 s 	 melt 	 	the	 bake 	 ry 	 	air	,	or	the	first	time	you	 pull 	 ed 	 	a	20	-	dollar	bill	out	of	your	old	jacket	pocket	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	found	money	.	``
the	last	``	a	``	is	 authentic 	 ity 	 	.
and	for	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	i	want	to	tell	you	a	quick	story	.
let	's	go	all	the	way	back	to	1932	when	,	on	a	peanut	farm	in	georgia	,	a	little	baby	boy	named	roosevelt	grier	was	born	.
roosevelt	grier	,	or	rosey	grier	,	 a 	 s 	 	people	used	to	call	him	,	grew	up	and	grew	 in 	 to 	 	a	300	-	pound	,	six	-	foot	-	five	 line 	 back 	 er 	 	in	the	nfl	.
he	's	number	76	in	the	picture	.
here	he	is	 picture 	 d 	 	with	the	``	 fear 	 some 	 	 four 	 some 	 	.	``
these	 we 	 re 	 	four	 guy 	 s 	 	on	the	l.a.	rams	in	the	1960s	you	did	not	want	to	go	up	against	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	tough	 foot 	 ball 	 	 player 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	love	,	which	was	 crush 	 ing 	 	 skull 	 s 	 	and	 separat 	 ing 	 	 shoulder 	 s 	 	on	the	 foot 	 ball 	 	field	.
but	rosey	grier	 al 	 so 	 	had	in	his	 deep 	 ly 	 	authentic	self	,	he	 al 	 so 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 needle 	 point 	 	.
he	 love 	 d 	 	 knit 	 ting 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	it	 calm 	 ed 	 	him	down	,	it	 relax 	 ed 	 	him	,	it	took	away	his	fear	of	 fly 	 ing 	 	and	 help 	 ed 	 	him	meet	 chick 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
i	mean	,	he	 love 	 d 	 	it	so	much	that	,	after	he	 retire 	 d 	 	from	the	nfl	,	he	 start 	 ed 	 	 join 	 ing 	 	 club 	 s 	 	.
and	he	even	put	out	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	rosey	grier	's	 needle 	 point 	 	for	men	.	``
it	's	a	great	cover	.
if	you	notice	,	he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 needle 	 point 	 ing 	 	his	own	face	.
and	so	what	i	love	about	 th 	 is 	 	story	is	that	rosey	grier	is	just	 s 	 uch 	 	an	authentic	person	,	and	that	's	what	 authentic 	 ity 	 	is	all	about	.
it	's	just	about	 be 	 ing 	 	you	and	 be 	 ing 	 	cool	with	that	.
and	i	think	when	you	're	authentic	,	you	end	up	 follow 	 ing 	 	your	heart	,	and	you	put	 your 	 self 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	and	 situ 	 ations 	 	and	in	 conversation 	 s 	 	that	you	love	and	that	you	enjoy	.
you	meet	people	that	you	like	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	.
you	go	 place 	 s 	 	you	've	 dream 	 t 	 	about	.
and	you	end	you	end	up	 follow 	 ing 	 	your	heart	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	three	a	's	.
for	the	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	thought	,	i	want	to	take	you	all	the	way	back	to	my	 parent 	 s 	 	coming	to	canada	.
i	do	n't	know	what	it	would	feel	like	coming	to	a	new	country	when	you	're	in	your	mid	-	20s	.
i	do	n't	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	never	did	it	,	but	i	would	imagine	that	it	would	take	a	great	attitude	.
i	would	imagine	that	you	'd	have	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	aware	of	your	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 appreci 	 ating 	 	the	small	 wonder 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	in	your	new	world	.
and	i	think	you	'd	have	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	authentic	,	you	'd	have	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	true	to	 your 	 self 	 	in	order	to	get	through	what	you	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	.
i	'd	like	to	pause	my	tedtalk	for	about	10	 second 	 s 	 	right	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	get	 man 	 y 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	life	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	my	 parent 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	front	row	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	ask	them	to	,	if	they	do	n't	mind	,	stand	up	.
and	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	thank	you	to	you	 guy 	 s 	 	.
when	i	was	growing	up	,	my	dad	used	to	love	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	story	of	his	first	day	in	canada	.
and	it	's	a	great	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	he	got	off	the	plane	at	the	toronto	 air 	 port 	 	,	and	he	was	 welcome 	 d 	 	by	a	non	-	profit	group	,	which	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 some 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 run 	 s 	 	.
