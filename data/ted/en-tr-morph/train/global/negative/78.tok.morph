ok	.	we	can	 viol 	 ate 	 	your	 expect 	 ations 	 	about	shape	.
we	can	 viol 	 ate 	 	your	 expect 	 ations 	 	on	 represent 	 ation 	 	--	what	an	image	 represent 	 s 	 	.	what	do	you	see	here	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	see	 dolphin 	 s 	 	?	raise	your	hand	if	you	see	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.	ok	,	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	raised	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	the	rest	of	the	audience	,	go	talk	to	them	,	all	right	?	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	best	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 prim 	 ing 	 	by	experience	that	i	know	.
if	you	are	a	child	under	the	age	of	10	who	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 ruin 	 ed 	 	yet	,	you	will	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	image	and	see	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.	now	,	some	of	you	 adult 	 s 	 	here	are	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	 dolphin 	 s 	 	?	what	 dolphin 	 s 	 	?	``
but	in	fact	,	if	you	 revers 	 ed 	 	the	figure	ground	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	dark	 area 	 s 	 	here	--	i	 for 	 got 	 	to	ask	for	a	 point 	 er 	 	--	but	if	you	reverse	it	,	you	'll	see	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	little	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.	by	the	way	,	if	you	're	 al 	 so 	 	a	student	at	caltech	--	they	 al 	 so 	 	tend	to	just	see	the	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.	it	's	based	on	now	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	used	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	after	all	talk	about	design	,	too	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	saatchi	and	saatchi	,	and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	away	with	 th 	 is 	 	ad	in	australia	.	so	,	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	ad	for	beer	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	in	sort	of	 pro 	 voc 	 ative 	 	 position 	 s 	 	.	but	they	got	it	 pass 	 ed 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	won	the	clio	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	so	it	's	funny	how	you	can	do	remember	that	sort	of	,	um	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	joke	i	did	when	the	florida	 ball 	 ot 	 	was	going	around	.	you	know	,	count	the	 dot 	 s 	 	for	gore	;	count	the	 dot 	 s 	 	for	bush	;	count	'	em	 aga 	 in 	 	...
you	can	 viol 	 ate 	 	your	 expect 	 ations 	 	about	experience	.	here	is	an	 out 	 side 	 	water	fountain	that	i	 create 	 d 	 	with	some	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	,	but	you	can	stop	the	water	in	 drop 	 s 	 	and	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	all	the	 drop 	 s 	 	 levit 	 ate 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	're	building	for	,	you	know	,	 amuse 	 ment 	 	 park 	 s 	 	and	that	kind	of	stuff	.
now	let	's	take	a	static	image	.	can	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	?
do	you	see	the	middle	section	moving	down	and	the	 out 	 er 	 	 section 	 s 	 	moving	up	?	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	static	.
it	's	a	static	image	.	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	see	 th 	 is 	 	illusion	?	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	static	.
right	.	now	,	when	--	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	when	we	look	at	an	image	we	see	,	you	know	,	color	,	depth	,	 text 	 ure 	 	.	and	you	can	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	whole	scene	and	 analyz 	 e 	 	it	.	you	can	see	the	woman	is	in	 close 	 r 	 	than	the	wall	and	so	forth	.	but	the	whole	thing	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	flat	.	it	's	 paint 	 ed 	 	.	it	's	 trom 	 pe 	 	l'oeil	.
and	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	good	 trom 	 pe 	 	l'oeil	that	people	got	 irrit 	 ated 	 	when	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	talk	to	the	woman	and	she	would	n't	respond	.
now	,	you	can	make	design	 mistak 	 es 	 	.	like	 th 	 is 	 	building	in	new	york	.	so	that	when	you	see	it	from	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	 balc 	 onies 	 	tilt	up	,	and	when	you	walk	around	to	the	other	side	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	 balc 	 onies 	 	go	down	.	so	there	are	 case 	 s 	 	where	you	have	 mistak 	 es 	 	in	design	that	or	,	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	un	-	retouched	photograph	.	now	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	i	get	a	lot	of	 email 	 s 	 	from	people	who	say	,	``	is	there	any	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 male 	 s 	 	and	 female 	 s 	 	?	``
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	say	,	``	no.	``	i	mean	,	women	can	 navig 	 ate 	 	through	the	world	just	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 male 	 s 	 	can	--	and	why	would	n't	they	?	 how 	 ever 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	one	illusion	that	women	can	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	do	better	than	 male 	 s 	 	:	in	 match 	 ing 	 	which	head	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 re 	 ly 	 	on	fashion	 cue 	 s 	 	.	they	can	match	the	hat	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	 get 	 ting 	 	to	a	part	--	i	want	to	show	design	in	 illusion 	 s 	 	.	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 illusion 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	 purpose 	 ly 	 	was	by	da	vinci	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ana 	 morphic 	 	image	of	an	eye	.	so	that	when	you	saw	from	one	little	angle	was	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	little	 techni 	 que 	 	got	popular	in	the	16th	century	and	the	17th	century	to	 dis 	 guise 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	 meaning 	 s 	 	,	where	you	could	flip	the	image	and	see	it	from	one	little	point	of	view	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	these	are	early	 in 	 corporation 	 s 	 	of	 illusion 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	--	sort	of	high	point	with	hans	holbein	's	``	 ambassador 	 s 	 	.	``	and	hans	holbein	 work 	 ed 	 	for	henry	viii	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	hung	on	a	wall	where	you	could	walk	down	from	the	stair	and	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	skull	.
all	right	,	now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	some	 design 	 ers 	 	who	work	with	 illusion 	 s 	 	to	give	that	element	of	surprise	.	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	is	scott	kim	.	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	scott	to	create	some	 illusion 	 s 	 	for	ted	that	i	hope	you	will	enjoy	.	we	have	one	here	on	ted	and	happiness	.
