i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	june	 s 	 aid 	 	,	to	talk	about	a	project	that	my	 t 	 win 	 	sister	and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	for	the	past	three	and	half	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 crochet 	 ing 	 	a	coral	reef	.
and	it	's	a	project	that	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	now	 join 	 ed 	 	by	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	around	the	world	,	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	with	us	.	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	different	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	project	that	now	 reach 	 es 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	three	 continent 	 s 	 	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 root 	 s 	 	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 field 	 s 	 	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	marine	biology	,	 femin 	 ine 	 	 hand 	 i 	 craft 	 	and	 environment 	 al 	 	 activ 	 ism 	 	.
it	's	true	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	project	that	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	way	,	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 parallel 	 ed 	 	the	evolution	of	life	on	earth	,	which	is	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	thing	to	be	 say 	 ing 	 	right	here	in	february	2009	--	which	,	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	our	previous	 speaker 	 s 	 	told	us	,	is	the	200th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	the	birth	of	charles	darwin	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	i	'm	going	to	get	to	in	the	next	18	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	hope	.
but	let	me	first	begin	by	 show 	 ing 	 	you	some	 picture 	 s 	 	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
just	to	give	you	an	idea	of	scale	,	that	 install 	 ation 	 	there	is	about	six	feet	 a 	 cross 	 	,	and	the	 tall 	 est 	 	 model 	 s 	 	are	about	two	or	three	feet	high	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	more	 image 	 s 	 	of	it	.
that	one	on	the	right	is	about	five	feet	high	.
the	work	 involve 	 s 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	different	crochet	 model 	 s 	 	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	there	are	now	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 model 	 s 	 	that	people	have	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	all	over	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	 total 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	 involve 	 s 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	human	labor	--	99	percent	of	it	 d 	 one 	 	by	women	.
on	the	right	hand	side	,	that	bit	there	is	part	of	an	 install 	 ation 	 	that	is	about	12	feet	long	.
my	sister	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	in	2005	 be 	 cause 	 	in	that	year	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	science	press	,	there	was	a	lot	of	talk	about	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	effect	that	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	on	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	.
 coral 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 delic 	 ate 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	,	and	they	are	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	by	any	rise	in	sea	 temperature 	 s 	 	.
it	 cause 	 s 	 	these	vast	 bleach 	 ing 	 	 event 	 s 	 	that	are	the	first	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 coral 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	sick	.
and	if	the	 bleach 	 ing 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	go	away	--	if	the	 temperature 	 s 	 	do	n't	go	down	--	 reef 	 s 	 	start	to	die	.
a	great	deal	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	great	 bar 	 rier 	 	reef	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	 in 	 voc 	 ation 	 	in	crochet	of	a	 bleach 	 ed 	 	reef	.
we	have	a	new	 organ 	 ization 	 	together	 call 	 ed 	 	the	institute	for	 figur 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	a	little	 organ 	 ization 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	promote	,	to	do	 project 	 s 	 	about	the	aesthetic	and	 poet 	 ic 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	science	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
and	i	went	and	put	a	little	 announce 	 ment 	 	up	on	our	 s 	 ite 	 	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	people	to	join	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	enterprise	.
to	our	surprise	,	one	of	the	first	people	who	 call 	 ed 	 	was	the	andy	warhol	museum	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	about	 artist 	 s 	 	'	 respons 	 e 	 	to	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	'd	like	our	coral	reef	to	be	part	of	it	.
i	 laugh 	 ed 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 start 	 ed 	 	it	,	you	can	have	a	little	bit	of	it	.	``
so	in	2007	we	had	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	,	a	small	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	crochet	reef	.
and	then	some	people	in	chicago	came	 a 	 long 	 	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	in	late	2007	,	the	theme	of	the	chicago	 human 	 ities 	 	 fest 	 ival 	 	is	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.	and	we	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	3,000	square	-	foot	 gall 	 ery 	 	and	we	want	you	to	fill	it	with	your	reef	.	``
and	i	,	 naive 	 ly 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	stage	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 	.	``
now	i	say	``	 naive 	 ly 	 	``	 be 	 cause 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	my	profession	is	 a 	 s 	 	a	science	writer	.
what	i	do	is	i	write	 book 	 s 	 	about	the	cultural	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	physics	.
i	've	written	 book 	 s 	 	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	space	,	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	physics	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	i	write	 article 	 s 	 	for	people	like	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	and	the	l.a.	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	i	had	no	idea	what	it	 me 	 ant 	 	to	fill	a	3,000	square	-	foot	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	.
and	i	went	home	,	and	i	told	my	sister	christine	.
and	she	 near 	 ly 	 	had	a	fit	 be 	 cause 	 	christine	is	a	professor	at	one	of	l.a.	's	major	art	 college 	 s 	 	,	calarts	,	and	she	 k 	 new 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	it	 me 	 ant 	 	to	fill	a	3,000	square	-	foot	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
she	thought	i	'd	gone	off	my	head	.
but	she	went	 in 	 to 	 	crochet	 over 	 drive 	 	.
and	to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	eight	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	we	did	fill	the	chicago	cultural	center	's	3,000	square	foot	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
by	 th 	 is 	 	stage	the	project	had	taken	on	a	viral	dimension	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	,	which	got	 complete 	 ly 	 	beyond	us	.
the	people	in	chicago	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 exhibit 	 ing 	 	our	 reef 	 s 	 	,	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	have	the	local	people	there	make	a	reef	.
so	we	went	and	taught	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.	we	did	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	and	 lectur 	 es 	 	.
and	the	people	in	chicago	made	a	reef	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
and	it	was	 exhibit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	 our 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	 involve 	 d 	 	in	that	.
we	got	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	do	the	whole	thing	in	new	york	,	and	in	london	,	and	in	los	angeles	.
in	each	of	these	cities	,	the	local	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	,	have	made	a	reef	.
and	more	and	more	people	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	most	of	whom	we	've	never	met	.
so	the	whole	thing	 ha 	 s 	 	sort	of	 morph 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	ever	-	 evolv 	 ing 	 	creature	,	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	gone	way	beyond	christine	and	i	.
now	some	of	you	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	planet	are	these	people	on	?
why	on	earth	are	you	 crochet 	 ing 	 	a	reef	?
woolenness	and	 wet 	 ness 	 	are	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	two	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	that	go	together	.
why	not	chisel	a	coral	reef	out	of	 mar 	 ble 	 	?
cast	it	in	 bron 	 ze 	 	.	``
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	reason	why	we	are	 crochet 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	in	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	kind	of	structure	.
the	 frill 	 y 	 	 cre 	 n 	 ulated 	 	 form 	 s 	 	that	you	see	in	 coral 	 s 	 	,	and	 kelp 	 s 	 	,	and	 sponge 	 s 	 	and	 nud 	 ibranchs 	 	,	is	a	form	of	 geo 	 metry 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	 geo 	 metry 	 	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	know	how	to	model	 th 	 is 	 	structure	is	with	crochet	.	it	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	a	fact	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	model	 th 	 is 	 	structure	any	other	way	,	and	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	do	it	on	 computer 	 s 	 	.
so	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	 geo 	 metry 	 	that	 coral 	 s 	 	and	sea	 slug 	 s 	 	 em 	 body 	 	?
the	next	few	 minute 	 s 	 	is	,	we	're	all	going	to	get	raised	up	to	the	level	of	a	sea	slug	.
 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 geo 	 metry 	 	 revolution 	 ized 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	when	it	was	first	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	the	19th	century	.
but	not	 un 	 til 	 	1997	did	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	understand	how	they	could	model	it	.
in	1997	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	at	cornell	,	daina	taimina	,	made	the	 discover 	 y 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	structure	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 d 	 one 	 	in	 knit 	 ting 	 	and	crochet	.
the	first	one	she	did	was	 knit 	 ting 	 	.
but	you	get	too	 man 	 y 	 	 stitch 	 es 	 	on	the	needle	.	so	she	 quick 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	crochet	was	the	better	thing	.
but	what	she	was	 do 	 ing 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	making	a	model	of	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	structure	,	that	 man 	 y 	 	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	had	thought	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	model	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	they	thought	that	 any 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	structure	was	 im 	 possible 	 	per	 s 	 e 	 	.
some	of	the	best	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	prove	that	 th 	 is 	 	structure	was	 im 	 possible 	 	.
so	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	structure	?
before	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	 geo 	 metry 	 	,	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	 k 	 new 	 	about	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	space	:	euclidean	space	,	and	 spheric 	 al 	 	space	.
and	they	have	different	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
 mathematic 	 ians 	 	like	to	 character 	 ize 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	by	 be 	 ing 	 	 form 	 alist 	 	.
you	all	have	a	sense	of	what	a	flat	space	is	,	euclidean	space	is	.
but	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	 form 	 al 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	way	.
and	what	they	do	is	,	they	do	it	through	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	parallel	lines	.
so	here	we	have	a	line	and	a	point	 out 	 side 	 	the	line	.
and	euclid	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	can	i	define	parallel	lines	?
i	ask	the	question	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	lines	can	i	draw	through	the	point	but	never	meet	the	original	line	?	``
and	you	all	know	the	answer	.	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 one 	 	want	to	shout	it	out	?
one	.	great	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
that	's	our	definition	of	a	parallel	line	.
it	's	a	definition	 re 	 ally 	 	of	euclidean	space	.
but	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	you	all	know	of	:	 spheric 	 al 	 	space	.
think	of	the	surface	of	a	sphere	--	just	like	a	beach	ball	,	the	surface	of	the	earth	.
i	have	a	straight	line	on	my	 spheric 	 al 	 	surface	.
and	i	have	a	point	 out 	 side 	 	the	line	.	how	 man 	 y 	 	straight	lines	can	i	draw	through	the	point	but	never	meet	the	original	line	?
what	do	we	mean	to	talk	about	a	straight	line	on	a	 curv 	 ed 	 	surface	?
now	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	have	 answer 	 ed 	 	that	question	.
they	've	 under 	 stood 	 	there	is	a	 general 	 ized 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 straight 	 ness 	 	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 geo 	 de 	 s 	 ic 	 	.
and	on	the	surface	of	a	sphere	,	a	straight	line	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	possible	circle	you	can	draw	.
so	it	's	like	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	or	the	lines	of	 long 	 itude 	 	.
so	we	ask	the	question	 aga 	 in 	 	,	``	how	 man 	 y 	 	straight	lines	can	i	draw	through	the	point	,	but	never	meet	the	original	line	?	``
 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 one 	 	want	to	guess	?
zero	.	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
now	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	thought	that	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	.
it	's	a	bit	suspicious	is	n't	it	?	there	is	two	 answer 	 s 	 	to	the	question	so	far	,	zero	and	one	.
two	 answer 	 s 	 	?	there	may	possibly	be	a	third	 alter 	 native 	 	.
to	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	if	there	are	two	 answer 	 s 	 	,	and	the	first	two	are	zero	and	one	,	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	number	that	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	third	 alter 	 native 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 one 	 	want	to	guess	what	it	is	?
 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	.	you	all	got	it	right	.	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
there	is	,	there	's	a	third	 alter 	 native 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
there	's	a	straight	line	,	and	there	is	an	infinite	number	of	lines	that	go	through	the	point	and	never	meet	the	original	line	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	drove	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	 bon 	 ker 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	like	you	,	they	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 feel 	 ing 	 	 bamboo 	 zl 	 ed 	 	.
 think 	 ing 	 	,	how	can	that	be	?	you	're	 cheat 	 ing 	 	.	the	lines	are	 curv 	 ed 	 	.
but	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 project 	 ing 	 	it	onto	a	flat	surface	.
 mathematic 	 ians 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	had	to	 re 	 ally 	 	struggle	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
how	could	they	see	 th 	 is 	 	?
what	did	it	mean	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	physical	model	that	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
it	's	a	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	imagine	that	we	'd	 on 	 ly 	 	ever	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	euclidean	space	.
then	our	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	come	 a 	 long 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	a	sphere	,	and	the	lines	come	together	at	the	north	and	south	pole	.	``
but	you	do	n't	know	what	a	sphere	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
and	 some 	 one 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	look	here	's	a	ball	.	``
and	you	go	,	``	ah	!	i	can	see	it	.	i	can	feel	it	.
i	can	touch	it	.	i	can	play	with	it	.	``
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	daina	taimina	in	1997	,	 show 	 ed 	 	that	you	could	crochet	 model 	 s 	 	in	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	space	.
here	is	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	in	 crochet 	 ness 	 	.
i	've	 stitch 	 ed 	 	euclid	's	parallel	 post 	 ulate 	 	on	to	the	surface	.
and	the	lines	look	 curv 	 ed 	 	.
but	look	,	i	can	prove	to	you	that	they	're	straight	 be 	 cause 	 	i	can	take	any	one	of	these	lines	,	and	i	can	fold	 a 	 long 	 	it	.
and	it	's	a	straight	line	.
so	here	,	in	wool	,	through	a	domestic	 femin 	 ine 	 	art	,	is	the	proof	that	the	most	famous	 post 	 ulate 	 	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	is	wrong	.
and	you	can	stitch	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 theor 	 em 	 s 	 	onto	these	 surface 	 s 	 	.
the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	space	 us 	 her 	 ed 	 	in	the	field	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	that	is	 call 	 ed 	 	non	-	euclidean	 geo 	 metry 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	field	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	that	 under 	 lies 	 	general	 relat 	 ivity 	 	and	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	going	to	show	us	about	the	shape	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	direct	line	between	 femin 	 ine 	 	 hand 	 i 	 craft 	 	,	euclid	and	general	 relat 	 ivity 	 	.
now	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	thought	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 im 	 possible 	 	.
here	's	two	 creature 	 s 	 	who	've	never	heard	of	euclid	's	parallel	 post 	 ulate 	 	--	did	n't	know	it	was	 im 	 possible 	 	to	 viol 	 ate 	 	,	and	they	're	 simpl 	 y 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	on	with	it	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	once	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	why	it	was	that	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	thought	 th 	 is 	 	structure	was	 im 	 possible 	 	when	sea	 slug 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	since	the	silurian	age	.
 the 	 ir 	 	answer	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	i	guess	there	are	n't	that	 man 	 y 	 	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	around	looking	at	sea	 slug 	 s 	 	.	``
and	that	's	true	.	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 go 	 es 	 	 deep 	 er 	 	than	that	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 say 	 s 	 	a	whole	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	about	what	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	thought	 mathematic 	 s 	 	was	,	what	they	thought	it	could	and	could	n't	do	,	what	they	thought	it	could	and	could	n't	represent	.
even	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	,	who	in	some	sense	are	the	 free 	 st 	 	of	all	 think 	 ers 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	could	n't	see	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	sea	 slug 	 s 	 	around	them	,	but	the	lettuce	on	 the 	 ir 	 	plate	--	 be 	 cause 	 	 lettuce 	 s 	 	,	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 cur 	 ly 	 	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	are	 embodi 	 ments 	 	of	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	 geo 	 metry 	 	.
and	so	in	some	sense	they	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	they	had	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 symbol 	 ic 	 	view	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	they	could	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	what	was	going	on	on	the	lettuce	in	front	of	them	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	natural	world	is	full	of	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	 wonder 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	too	,	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	there	is	an	infinite	 tax 	 o 	 nomy 	 	of	crochet	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	,	chrissy	and	i	and	our	 contributor 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	the	simple	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	perfect	 model 	 s 	 	.
but	we	found	that	when	we	 dev 	 iated 	 	from	the	specific	 set 	 ness 	 	of	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	code	that	 under 	 lies 	 	it	--	the	simple	algorithm	crochet	three	,	 in 	 crease 	 	one	--	when	we	 dev 	 iated 	 	from	that	and	made	 em 	 bell 	 ish 	 ments 	 	to	the	code	,	the	 model 	 s 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	more	natural	.
and	all	of	our	 contributor 	 s 	 	,	who	are	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	people	around	the	world	,	do	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 em 	 bell 	 ish 	 ments 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	ever	-	 evolv 	 ing 	 	,	crochet	 tax 	 o 	 nomic 	 	tree	of	life	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	the	 morpho 	 logy 	 	and	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	life	on	earth	is	never	 end 	 ing 	 	,	little	 em 	 bell 	 ish 	 ments 	 	and	 complex 	 ification 	 s 	 	in	the	dna	code	lead	to	new	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 giraffe 	 s 	 	,	or	 orchid 	 s 	 	--	so	too	,	do	little	 em 	 bell 	 ish 	 ments 	 	in	the	crochet	code	lead	to	new	and	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	in	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	tree	of	crochet	life	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	project	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	on	 th 	 is 	 	inner	 organ 	 ic 	 	life	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	.
there	is	the	 total 	 ity 	 	of	all	the	people	who	have	come	to	it	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	individual	 vision 	 s 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	mode	.
we	have	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	.	we	use	them	.
but	why	?	what	's	at	 s 	 take 	 	here	?	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	matter	?
for	chrissy	and	i	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	here	is	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	suggest	the	 import 	 ance 	 	and	value	of	 embodi 	 ed 	 	knowledge	.
we	live	in	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	 complete 	 ly 	 	 tend 	 s 	 	to	 val 	 or 	 ize 	 	 symbol 	 ic 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 represent 	 ation 	 	--	 algebra 	 ic 	 	 represent 	 ations 	 	,	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	 code 	 s 	 	.
we	live	in	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	's	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 present 	 ing 	 	information	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	 teach 	 ing 	 	information	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
but	through	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 mod 	 ality 	 	,	crochet	,	other	plastic	 form 	 s 	 	of	play	--	people	can	be	 engag 	 ed 	 	with	the	most	abstract	,	high	-	powered	,	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	that	 normal 	 ly 	 	you	have	to	go	to	university	 depart 	 ments 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	in	 high 	 er 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	which	is	where	i	first	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 hyper 	 bolic 	 	space	.
but	you	can	do	it	through	 play 	 ing 	 	with	material	 object 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	ways	that	we	've	come	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	the	institute	for	 figur 	 ing 	 	and	 project 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	have	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	for	grown	-	 up 	 s 	 	.
and	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 form 	 al 	 ized 	 	system	of	education	,	 establish 	 ed 	 	by	a	man	named	friedrich	froebel	,	who	was	a	 crystall 	 ographer 	 	in	the	19th	century	.
he	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	the	crystal	was	the	model	for	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 represent 	 ation 	 	.
he	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	radical	 alter 	 native 	 	system	of	 engag 	 ing 	 	the	 small 	 est 	 	children	with	the	most	abstract	 idea 	 s 	 	through	physical	 form 	 s 	 	of	play	.
and	he	is	worthy	of	an	entire	talk	on	his	own	right	.
the	value	of	education	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	froebel	 champion 	 ed 	 	,	through	plastic	 mode 	 s 	 	of	play	.
we	live	in	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	now	where	we	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	think	 tank 	 s 	 	,	where	great	 mind 	 s 	 	go	to	think	about	the	world	.
they	write	these	great	 symbol 	 ic 	 	 treat 	 ise 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	 paper 	 s 	 	,	and	op	-	ed	 article 	 s 	 	.
we	want	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	,	chrissy	and	i	,	through	the	institute	for	 figur 	 ing 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	play	tank	.
and	the	play	tank	,	like	the	think	tank	,	is	a	place	where	people	can	go	and	engage	with	great	 idea 	 s 	 	.
but	what	we	want	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	,	is	that	the	highest	 level 	 s 	 	of	 abstract 	 ion 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	computing	,	logic	,	etc	.	--	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 engag 	 ed 	 	with	,	not	just	through	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	cerebral	 algebra 	 ic 	 	 symbol 	 ic 	 	 method 	 s 	 	,	but	by	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	 idea 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
