 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	 aga 	 in 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	our	 diet 	 s 	 	.
and	i	would	like	to	know	what	the	audience	is	,	and	so	who	of	you	ever	ate	 insect 	 s 	 	?
that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	.
but	still	,	you	're	not	 represent 	 ing 	 	the	 over 	 all 	 	population	of	the	earth	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	80	percent	out	there	that	 re 	 ally 	 	eats	 insect 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	good	.
why	not	eat	 insect 	 s 	 	?	well	first	,	what	are	 insect 	 s 	 	?
 insect 	 s 	 	are	 animal 	 s 	 	that	walk	around	on	six	 leg 	 s 	 	.
and	here	you	see	just	a	 s 	 election 	 	.
there	's	six	million	species	of	 insect 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	six	million	species	.
there	's	a	few	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mammal 	 s 	 	--	six	million	species	of	 insect 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	if	we	count	all	the	individual	 organism 	 s 	 	,	we	would	come	at	much	 large 	 r 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	of	all	 animal 	 s 	 	on	earth	,	of	all	animal	species	,	80	percent	 walk 	 s 	 	on	six	 leg 	 s 	 	.
but	if	we	would	count	all	the	 individual 	 s 	 	,	and	we	take	an	average	weight	of	them	,	it	would	amount	to	 some 	 thing 	 	like	200	to	2,000	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	for	each	of	you	and	me	on	earth	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 bio 	 mass 	 	,	 insect 	 s 	 	are	more	abundant	than	we	are	,	and	we	're	not	on	a	planet	of	men	,	but	we	're	on	a	planet	of	 insect 	 s 	 	.
 insect 	 s 	 	are	not	 on 	 ly 	 	there	in	nature	,	but	they	 al 	 so 	 	are	 involve 	 d 	 	in	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	 with 	 out 	 	us	 know 	 ing 	 	.
there	was	an	estimation	,	a	 conserv 	 ative 	 	estimation	,	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 benefit 	 ed 	 	by	57	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	year	.
it	's	a	number	--	 ver 	 y 	 	large	--	a	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	for	free	.
and	so	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	what	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	was	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	the	war	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	in	the	same	year	.
it	was	80	billion	u.s.	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
well	we	know	that	that	was	not	a	cheap	war	.
so	 insect 	 s 	 	,	just	for	free	,	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	with	about	the	same	order	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	,	just	for	free	,	 with 	 out 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	but	in	any	country	,	in	any	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
what	do	they	do	?
they	 re 	 move 	 	dung	,	they	 pollinat 	 e 	 	our	 crop 	 s 	 	.
a	third	of	all	the	 fruit 	 s 	 	that	we	eat	are	all	a	result	of	 insect 	 s 	 	taking	care	of	the	 re 	 production 	 	of	 plant 	 s 	 	.
they	control	 pest 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	food	for	 animal 	 s 	 	.
they	're	at	the	start	of	food	 chain 	 s 	 	.
small	 animal 	 s 	 	eat	 insect 	 s 	 	.
even	 large 	 r 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	eat	 insect 	 s 	 	.
but	the	small	 animal 	 s 	 	that	eat	 insect 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	eaten	by	 large 	 r 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	still	 large 	 r 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	at	the	end	of	the	food	chain	,	we	are	eating	them	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
there	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	people	that	are	eating	 insect 	 s 	 	.
and	here	you	see	me	in	a	small	,	 prov 	 in 	 cial 	 	town	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	lijiang	--	about	two	million	 inhabit 	 ants 	 	.
if	you	go	out	for	 d 	 inner 	 	,	like	in	a	fish	restaurant	,	where	you	can	select	which	fish	you	want	to	eat	,	you	can	select	which	 insect 	 s 	 	you	would	like	to	eat	.
and	they	 prep 	 are 	 	it	in	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	.
and	here	you	see	me	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	a	meal	with	 cater 	 pillar 	 s 	 	,	 locu 	 st 	 s 	 	,	bee	 pupa 	 e 	 	--	 delic 	 acies 	 	.
and	you	can	eat	 some 	 thing 	 	new	 every 	 day 	 	.
there	's	more	than	1,000	species	of	 insect 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	eaten	all	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	more	than	just	a	few	 mammal 	 s 	 	that	we	're	eating	,	like	a	cow	or	a	pig	or	a	sheep	.
more	than	1,000	species	--	an	enormous	 varie 	 ty 	 	.
and	now	you	may	think	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 prov 	 in 	 cial 	 	town	in	 chin 	 a 	 	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	but	not	us	.
well	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	that	 quit 	 e 	 	some	of	you	 al 	 ready 	 	ate	 insect 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	but	i	can	tell	you	that	every	one	of	you	is	eating	 insect 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	exception	.
you	're	eating	at	 l 	 east 	 	500	 gram 	 s 	 	per	year	.
what	are	you	eating	?
tomato	soup	,	peanut	butter	,	chocolate	,	 noodl 	 es 	 	--	any	 process 	 ed 	 	food	that	you	're	eating	 contain 	 s 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	are	here	all	around	us	,	and	when	they	're	out	there	in	nature	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	in	our	 crop 	 s 	 	.
some	 fruit 	 s 	 	get	some	insect	damage	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 fruit 	 s 	 	,	if	they	're	tomato	,	that	go	to	the	tomato	soup	.
if	they	do	n't	have	any	damage	,	they	go	to	the	 grocer 	 y 	 	.
and	that	's	your	view	of	a	tomato	.
but	there	's	 tomato 	 es 	 	that	end	up	in	a	soup	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	they	meet	the	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	of	the	food	 age 	 ncy 	 	,	there	can	be	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	there	,	no	problem	.
in	fact	,	why	would	we	put	these	 ball 	 s 	 	in	the	soup	,	there	's	meat	in	there	 any 	 way 	 	?
in	fact	,	all	our	 process 	 ed 	 	 food 	 s 	 	contain	more	 protein 	 s 	 	than	we	would	be	aware	of	.
so	 any 	 thing 	 	is	a	good	protein	source	 al 	 ready 	 	.
now	you	may	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	we	're	eating	500	 gram 	 s 	 	just	by	accident	.	``
we	're	even	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	purpose	.
in	a	lot	of	food	 item 	 s 	 	that	we	have	--	i	have	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 item 	 s 	 	here	on	the	slide	--	pink	 cookie 	 s 	 	or	 sur 	 im 	 i 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	or	,	if	you	like	,	campari	--	a	lot	of	our	food	 product 	 s 	 	that	are	of	a	red	color	are	 dy 	 ed 	 	with	a	natural	dye	.
the	 sur 	 im 	 i 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	[	of	]	 crab 	 meat 	 	,	or	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	crab	meat	,	is	white	fish	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 dy 	 ed 	 	with	cochineal	.
cochineal	is	a	product	of	an	insect	that	 live 	 s 	 	off	these	cacti	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	in	large	 amount 	 s 	 	,	150	to	180	metric	 ton 	 s 	 	per	year	in	the	 can 	 ary 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	in	peru	,	and	it	's	big	business	.
one	gram	of	cochineal	 cost 	 s 	 	about	30	 eur 	 os 	 	.
one	gram	of	gold	is	30	 eur 	 os 	 	.
so	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	precious	thing	that	we	're	using	to	dye	our	 food 	 s 	 	.
now	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	the	world	is	going	to	change	for	you	and	me	,	for	 every 	 one 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	.
the	human	population	is	growing	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	and	is	growing	 exponential 	 ly 	 	.
where	,	at	the	moment	,	we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	between	six	and	seven	billion	people	,	it	will	grow	to	about	nine	billion	in	2050	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	have	a	lot	more	 mouth 	 s 	 	to	feed	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 worri 	 es 	 	more	and	more	people	.
there	was	an	fao	 con 	 ference 	 	last	october	that	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 devote 	 d 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
how	are	we	going	to	feed	 th 	 is 	 	world	?
and	if	you	look	at	the	 figure 	 s 	 	up	there	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	that	we	have	a	third	more	 mouth 	 s 	 	to	feed	,	but	we	need	an	 agricultur 	 al 	 	production	 in 	 crease 	 	of	70	percent	.
and	that	's	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	population	is	increasing	,	and	it	's	increasing	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 number 	 s 	 	,	but	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 wealth 	 ier 	 	,	and	 any 	 one 	 	that	 get 	 s 	 	 wealth 	 ier 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	eat	more	and	 al 	 so 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	eat	more	meat	.
and	meat	,	in	fact	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 cost 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	our	 agricultur 	 al 	 	production	.
our	diet	 consist 	 s 	 	,	[	in	]	some	part	,	of	animal	 protein 	 s 	 	,	and	at	the	moment	,	most	of	us	here	get	it	from	 live 	 stock 	 	,	from	fish	,	from	game	.
and	we	eat	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	it	.
in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	it	's	on	average	80	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	per	person	per	year	,	which	 go 	 es 	 	up	to	120	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	a	bit	lower	in	some	other	 count 	 ries 	 	,	but	on	average	80	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	per	person	per	year	.
in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	it	's	much	lower	.
it	's	25	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	per	person	per	year	.
but	it	's	increasing	 enormous 	 ly 	 	.
in	 chin 	 a 	 	in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	from	20	to	50	,	and	it	's	still	increasing	.
so	if	a	third	of	the	world	population	is	going	to	 in 	 crease 	 	 it 	 s 	 	meat	consumption	from	25	to	80	on	average	,	and	a	third	of	the	world	population	is	living	in	 chin 	 a 	 	and	in	india	,	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	enormous	demand	on	meat	.
and	of	course	,	we	are	not	there	to	say	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	for	us	,	it	's	not	for	them	.
they	have	the	same	share	that	we	have	.
now	to	start	with	,	i	should	say	that	we	are	eating	way	too	much	meat	in	the	western	world	.
we	could	do	with	much	,	much	less	--	and	i	know	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	 veget 	 arian 	 	for	a	long	time	,	and	you	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	do	 with 	 out 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
you	'll	get	 protein 	 s 	 	in	any	kind	of	food	 any 	 way 	 	.
but	then	there	's	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	come	with	meat	production	,	and	we	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 face 	 d 	 	with	that	more	and	more	often	.
the	first	problem	that	we	're	facing	is	human	health	.
 pig 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	like	us	.
they	're	even	 model 	 s 	 	in	medicine	,	and	we	can	even	transplant	 organ 	 s 	 	from	a	pig	to	a	human	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 pig 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	share	 disease 	 s 	 	with	us	.
and	a	pig	disease	,	a	pig	virus	,	and	a	human	virus	can	both	 pro 	 life 	 rate 	 	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	kind	of	 re 	 production 	 	,	they	can	combine	and	produce	a	new	virus	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	netherlands	in	the	1990s	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 classic 	 al 	 	 s 	 wine 	 	 f 	 ever 	 	 out 	 break 	 	.
you	get	a	new	disease	that	can	be	 dead 	 ly 	 	.
we	eat	 insect 	 s 	 	--	they	're	so	 di 	 stant 	 ly 	 	related	from	us	that	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	.
so	that	's	one	point	for	 insect 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	the	 con 	 version 	 	factor	.
you	take	10	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	feed	,	you	can	get	one	 kilo 	 gram 	 	of	beef	,	but	you	can	get	nine	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	 locu 	 st 	 	meat	.
so	if	you	would	be	an	entrepreneur	,	what	would	you	do	?
with	10	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 put 	 	,	you	can	get	either	one	or	nine	 k 	 g 	 	.	of	 out 	 put 	 	.
so	far	we	're	taking	the	one	,	or	up	to	five	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	 out 	 put 	 	.
we	're	not	taking	the	 bon 	 us 	 	yet	.
we	're	not	taking	the	nine	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	 out 	 put 	 	yet	.
so	that	's	two	 point 	 s 	 	for	 insect 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	the	environment	.
if	we	take	10	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	food	--	and	it	 result 	 s 	 	in	one	 kilo 	 gram 	 	of	beef	,	the	other	nine	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	are	waste	,	and	a	lot	of	that	is	 man 	 ure 	 	.
if	you	produce	 insect 	 s 	 	,	you	have	less	 man 	 ure 	 	per	 kilo 	 gram 	 	of	meat	that	you	produce	.
so	less	waste	.
 further 	 more 	 	,	per	 kilo 	 gram 	 	of	 man 	 ure 	 	,	you	have	much	,	much	less	 ammo 	 nia 	 	and	 few 	 er 	 	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	when	you	have	insect	 man 	 ure 	 	than	when	you	have	cow	 man 	 ure 	 	.
so	you	have	less	waste	,	and	the	waste	that	you	have	is	not	 a 	 s 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	malign	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	with	cow	dung	.
so	that	's	three	 point 	 s 	 	for	 insect 	 s 	 	.
now	there	's	a	big	``	if	,	``	of	course	,	and	it	is	if	 insect 	 s 	 	produce	meat	that	is	of	good	quality	.
well	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	analyses	and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	protein	,	or	fat	,	or	 vita 	 min 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
in	fact	,	it	's	 compar 	 able 	 	to	 any 	 thing 	 	we	eat	 a 	 s 	 	meat	at	the	moment	.
and	even	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 calorie 	 s 	 	,	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
one	 kilo 	 gram 	 	of	 grass 	 hopper 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	amount	of	 calorie 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	10	hot	 dog 	 s 	 	,	or	six	big	macs	.
so	that	's	four	 point 	 s 	 	for	 insect 	 s 	 	.
i	can	go	on	,	and	i	could	make	 man 	 y 	 	more	 point 	 s 	 	for	 insect 	 s 	 	,	but	time	 do 	 es 	 	n't	allow	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	the	question	is	,	why	not	eat	 insect 	 s 	 	?
i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	at	 l 	 east 	 	four	 argument 	 s 	 	in	favor	.
we	'll	have	to	.
even	if	you	do	n't	like	it	,	you	'll	have	to	get	used	to	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	at	the	moment	,	70	percent	of	all	our	 agricultur 	 al 	 	land	is	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	produce	 live 	 stock 	 	.
that	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	land	where	the	 live 	 stock 	 	is	 walk 	 ing 	 	and	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	other	 area 	 s 	 	where	the	feed	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 transport 	 ed 	 	.
we	can	 in 	 crease 	 	it	a	bit	at	the	expense	of	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	,	but	there	's	a	 limit 	 ation 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	.
and	if	you	remember	that	we	need	to	 in 	 crease 	 	 agricultur 	 al 	 	production	by	70	percent	,	we	're	not	going	to	make	it	that	way	.
we	could	much	better	change	from	meat	,	from	beef	,	to	 insect 	 s 	 	.
and	then	80	percent	of	the	world	 al 	 ready 	 	eats	 insect 	 s 	 	,	so	we	are	just	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	--	in	a	country	like	the	u.k.	,	the	usa	,	the	netherlands	,	 any 	 where 	 	.
on	the	left	-	hand	side	,	you	see	a	market	in	laos	where	they	have	 abundant 	 ly 	 	present	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 insect 	 s 	 	that	you	 choos 	 e 	 	for	 d 	 inner 	 	for	the	night	.
on	the	right	-	hand	side	you	see	a	 grass 	 hopper 	 	.
so	people	there	are	eating	them	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 hung 	 ry 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	they	think	it	's	a	 delic 	 acy 	 	.
it	's	just	 ver 	 y 	 	good	food	.
you	can	vary	 enormous 	 ly 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	have	 delic 	 acy 	 	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	 th 	 is 	 	 grass 	 hopper 	 	:	 shrimp 	 s 	 	,	a	 delic 	 acy 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	at	a	high	price	.
who	would	n't	like	to	eat	a	shrimp	?
there	are	a	few	people	who	do	n't	like	shrimp	,	but	shrimp	,	or	 crab 	 s 	 	,	or	 cray 	 fish 	 	,	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	related	.
they	are	 delic 	 acies 	 	.
in	fact	,	a	 locu 	 st 	 	is	a	``	shrimp	``	of	the	land	,	and	it	would	make	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 in 	 to 	 	our	diet	.
so	why	are	we	not	eating	 insect 	 s 	 	yet	?
well	that	's	just	a	matter	of	 mind 	 set 	 	.
we	're	not	used	to	it	,	and	we	see	 insect 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	these	 organism 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	us	.
that	's	why	we	're	changing	the	 per 	 ception 	 	of	 insect 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	with	my	 col 	 league 	 	,	arnold	van	huis	,	in	 tell 	 ing 	 	people	what	 insect 	 s 	 	are	,	what	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	they	are	,	what	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 job 	 s 	 	they	do	in	nature	.
and	in	fact	,	 with 	 out 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	,	we	would	not	be	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	the	 insect 	 s 	 	die	out	,	we	will	soon	die	out	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
if	we	die	out	,	the	 insect 	 s 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	.
so	we	have	to	get	used	to	the	idea	of	eating	 insect 	 s 	 	.
and	some	might	think	,	well	they	're	not	yet	 avail 	 able 	 	.
well	they	are	.
there	are	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	in	the	netherlands	that	produce	them	,	and	one	of	them	is	here	in	the	audience	,	marian	peeters	,	who	's	in	the	picture	.
i	predict	that	 lat 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	you	'll	get	them	in	the	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	--	not	visible	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	animal	protein	in	the	food	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	by	2020	,	you	'll	buy	them	just	 know 	 ing 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	insect	that	you	're	going	to	eat	.
and	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	made	in	the	most	 wonder 	 ful 	 	ways	.
a	dutch	chocolate	maker	.
so	there	's	even	a	lot	of	design	to	it	.
well	in	the	netherlands	,	we	have	an	 innov 	 ative 	 	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	and	she	 put 	 s 	 	the	 insect 	 s 	 	on	the	menu	in	her	restaurant	in	her	 mini 	 stry 	 	.
and	when	she	got	all	the	 mini 	 sters 	 	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	of	the	e.u	.
over	to	the	hague	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	she	went	to	a	high	-	class	restaurant	,	and	they	ate	 insect 	 s 	 	all	together	.
it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	a	hobby	of	mine	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	taken	off	the	ground	.
so	why	not	eat	 insect 	 s 	 	?
you	should	try	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	had	1,750	people	all	together	in	a	square	in	wageningen	town	,	and	they	ate	 insect 	 s 	 	at	the	same	moment	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	still	big	,	big	news	.
i	think	soon	it	will	not	be	big	news	 any 	 more 	 	when	we	all	eat	 insect 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	just	a	normal	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	you	can	try	it	 your 	 self 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	i	would	say	,	enjoy	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	to	bruno	some	first	tries	,	and	he	can	have	the	first	bite	.
bruno	giussani	:	look	at	them	first	.	look	at	them	first	.
marcel	dicke	:	it	's	all	protein	.
bg	:	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	[	one	]	you	saw	in	the	video	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	 look 	 s 	 	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
they	just	make	it	[	with	]	nuts	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
md	:	thank	you	.
