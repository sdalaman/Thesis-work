we	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	our	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	60	percent	of	our	communication	time	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	but	we	're	not	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	it	.
we	retain	just	25	percent	of	what	we	hear	.
now	not	you	,	not	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	but	that	is	 general 	 ly 	 	true	.
let	's	define	 listen 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	making	meaning	from	sound	.
it	's	a	mental	process	,	and	it	's	a	process	of	 extra 	 ction 	 	.
we	use	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	of	them	is	pattern	 re 	 cognition 	 	.
so	in	a	 cock 	 tail 	 	party	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	i	say	,	``	david	,	sara	,	pay	attention	,	``	some	of	you	just	 s 	 at 	 	up	.
we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	to	distinguish	noise	from	signal	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	our	name	.
differencing	is	 an 	 other 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	we	use	.
if	i	left	 th 	 is 	 	pink	noise	on	for	more	than	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	would	 liter 	 ally 	 	cease	to	hear	it	.
we	listen	to	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	we	 dis 	 count 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	that	remain	the	same	.
and	then	there	is	a	whole	range	of	 filter 	 s 	 	.
these	 filter 	 s 	 	take	us	from	all	sound	down	to	what	we	pay	attention	to	.
most	people	are	 entire 	 ly 	 	 un 	 conscious 	 	of	these	 filter 	 s 	 	.
but	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	our	 re 	 ality 	 	in	a	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	tell	us	what	we	're	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	right	now	.
give	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	:	 intent 	 ion 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	sound	,	in	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
when	i	married	my	wife	,	i	 promise 	 d 	 	her	that	i	would	listen	to	her	every	day	 a 	 s 	 	if	for	the	first	time	.
now	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	i	fall	short	of	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
but	it	's	a	great	 intent 	 ion 	 	to	have	in	a	relationship	.
but	that	's	not	all	.
sound	 place 	 s 	 	us	in	space	and	in	time	.
if	you	close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	right	now	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	you	're	aware	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	room	from	the	 reverbe 	 ration 	 	and	the	 bounc 	 ing 	 	of	the	sound	off	the	 surface 	 s 	 	.
and	you	're	aware	of	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	are	around	you	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	micro	-	 noise 	 s 	 	you	're	 receiv 	 ing 	 	.
and	sound	 place 	 s 	 	us	in	time	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	sound	 al 	 ways 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	time	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	it	.
in	fact	,	i	would	suggest	that	our	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	the	main	way	that	we	experience	the	flow	of	time	from	past	to	future	.
so	,	``	sonority	is	time	and	meaning	``	--	a	great	quote	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	we	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	our	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
why	did	i	say	that	?
well	there	are	a	lot	of	 reason 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
first	of	all	,	we	 invent 	 ed 	 	ways	of	 record 	 ing 	 	--	first	writing	,	then	audio	 record 	 ing 	 	and	now	video	 record 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	 pre 	 mium 	 	on	accurate	and	 care 	 ful 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	the	world	is	now	so	noisy	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	 caco 	 phony 	 	going	on	 visual 	 ly 	 	and	 audit 	 or 	 ily 	 	,	it	's	just	hard	to	listen	;	it	's	 ti 	 ring 	 	to	listen	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	take	refuge	in	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	but	they	turn	big	,	public	 space 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	personal	sound	 bubble 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	scenario	,	 no 	 body 	 	's	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 any 	 body 	 	.
we	're	 be 	 coming 	 	 im 	 patient 	 	.
we	do	n't	want	 or 	 atory 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,	we	want	sound	 bite 	 s 	 	.
and	the	art	of	conversation	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	--	 danger 	 ously 	 	,	i	think	--	by	personal	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	how	much	 listen 	 ing 	 	there	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	,	which	is	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	common	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	the	u.k	.
we	're	 be 	 coming 	 	 de 	 sensitized 	 	.
our	media	have	to	 s 	 cream 	 	at	us	with	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 head 	 lines 	 	in	order	to	get	our	attention	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	it	's	 hard 	 er 	 	for	us	to	pay	attention	to	the	quiet	,	the	subtle	,	the	 under 	 state 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	serious	problem	that	we	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	our	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	trivial	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	our	access	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
conscious	 listen 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 create 	 s 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	 with 	 out 	 	conscious	 listen 	 ing 	 	can	these	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	--	a	world	where	we	do	n't	listen	to	each	other	at	all	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	place	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	five	simple	 exercis 	 es 	 	,	 tool 	 s 	 	you	can	take	away	with	you	,	to	improve	your	own	conscious	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
would	you	like	that	?
good	.
the	first	one	is	silence	.
just	three	 minute 	 s 	 	a	day	of	silence	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	to	 re 	 set 	 	your	 ear 	 s 	 	and	to	 re 	 calibrate 	 	so	that	you	can	hear	the	quiet	 aga 	 in 	 	.
if	you	ca	n't	get	absolute	silence	,	go	for	quiet	,	that	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fine	.
second	,	i	call	 th 	 is 	 	the	 mix 	 er 	 	.
so	even	if	you	're	in	a	noisy	environment	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	we	all	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	listen	in	the	coffee	bar	to	how	 man 	 y 	 	 channel 	 s 	 	of	sound	can	i	hear	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	individual	 channel 	 s 	 	in	that	mix	am	i	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	?
you	can	do	it	in	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	place	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	like	in	a	lake	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	am	i	 hear 	 ing 	 	?
where	are	they	?	where	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 ripple 	 s 	 	?
it	's	a	great	 exercis 	 e 	 	for	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	quality	of	your	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
third	,	 th 	 is 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	i	call	 savor 	 ing 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
it	's	about	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	mundane	 sound 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	my	tumble	 dry 	 er 	 	.
it	's	a	waltz	.
one	,	two	,	three	.	one	,	two	,	three	.	one	,	two	,	three	.
i	love	it	.
or	just	try	 th 	 is 	 	one	on	for	 s 	 ize 	 	.
 w 	 ow 	 	!
so	mundane	 sound 	 s 	 	can	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	if	you	pay	attention	.
i	call	that	the	 hid 	 den 	 	choir	.
it	's	around	us	all	the	time	.
the	next	 exercis 	 e 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	of	all	of	these	,	if	you	just	take	one	thing	away	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	 position 	 s 	 	--	the	idea	that	you	can	move	your	 listen 	 ing 	 	position	to	what	's	appropriate	to	what	you	're	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 play 	 ing 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 filter 	 s 	 	.
do	you	remember	,	i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	 t 	 hose 	 	 filter 	 s 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	play	with	them	 a 	 s 	 	 lever 	 s 	 	,	to	get	conscious	about	them	and	to	move	to	different	 place 	 s 	 	.
these	are	just	some	of	the	 listen 	 ing 	 	 position 	 s 	 	,	or	 scale 	 s 	 	of	 listen 	 ing 	 	 position 	 s 	 	,	that	you	can	use	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	.
have	 f 	 un 	 	with	that	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	an	acronym	.
you	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	in	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	in	communication	.
if	you	're	in	any	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 role 	 s 	 	--	and	i	think	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	 every 	 body 	 	who	's	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	talk	--	the	acronym	is	rasa	,	which	is	the	sanskrit	word	for	juice	or	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	.
and	rasa	 stand 	 s 	 	for	 receiv 	 e 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	pay	attention	to	the	person	;	appreciate	,	making	little	 noise 	 s 	 	like	``	hmm	,	``	``	oh	,	``	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	``	;	summarize	,	the	word	``	so	``	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	communication	;	and	ask	,	ask	 question 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 	.
now	sound	is	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	it	's	my	life	.
i	wrote	a	whole	book	about	it	.	so	i	live	to	listen	.
that	's	too	much	to	ask	from	most	people	.
but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	every	human	 be 	 ing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	listen	 conscious 	 ly 	 	in	order	to	live	fully	--	 connect 	 ed 	 	in	space	and	in	time	to	the	physical	world	around	us	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	,	not	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	 spiritual 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	spiritual	path	i	know	of	 ha 	 s 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	and	 contempl 	 ation 	 	at	 it 	 s 	 	heart	.
that	's	why	we	need	to	teach	 listen 	 ing 	 	in	our	 school 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	skill	.
why	is	it	not	taught	?	it	's	crazy	.
and	if	we	can	teach	 listen 	 ing 	 	in	our	 school 	 s 	 	,	we	can	take	our	 listen 	 ing 	 	off	that	 slip 	 per 	 y 	 	 slop 	 e 	 	to	that	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	 scar 	 y 	 	world	that	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	and	move	it	to	a	place	where	 every 	 body 	 	is	 conscious 	 ly 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	all	the	time	--	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
now	i	do	n't	know	how	to	do	that	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	ted	,	and	i	think	the	ted	community	is	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 any 	 thing 	 	.
so	i	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	connect	with	me	,	connect	with	each	other	,	take	 th 	 is 	 	mission	out	and	let	's	get	 listen 	 ing 	 	taught	in	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	transform	the	world	in	one	generation	to	a	conscious	 listen 	 ing 	 	world	--	a	world	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	a	world	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	a	world	of	peace	.
thank	you	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	me	 to 	 day 	 	.
