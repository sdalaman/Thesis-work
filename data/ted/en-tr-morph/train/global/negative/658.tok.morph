 th 	 is 	 	is	my	first	time	at	ted	.	 normal 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	man	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	speak	at	ted	 e 	 vil 	 	,	which	is	ted	's	secret	sister	that	 pay 	 s 	 	all	the	 bill 	 s 	 	.
it	's	held	every	two	 year 	 s 	 	in	burma	.
and	i	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	remember	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	speech	by	kim	jong	il	on	how	to	get	 teen 	 s 	 	 smok 	 ing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 sudden 	 ly 	 	come	to	me	after	 year 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	business	,	that	what	we	create	in	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 in 	 tangible 	 	value	--	you	might	call	it	 perceive 	 d 	 	value	,	you	might	call	it	badge	value	,	 subject 	 ive 	 	value	,	 in 	 tangible 	 	value	of	some	kind	--	 get 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	a	bad	rap	.
if	you	think	about	it	,	if	you	want	to	live	in	a	world	in	the	future	where	there	are	 few 	 er 	 	material	 good 	 s 	 	,	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	two	 choice 	 s 	 	.
you	can	either	live	in	a	world	which	is	 poor 	 er 	 	,	which	people	in	general	do	n't	like	.
or	you	can	live	in	a	world	where	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 tangible 	 	value	 constitute 	 s 	 	a	 great 	 er 	 	part	of	 over 	 all 	 	value	,	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 tangible 	 	value	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	fine	 substitut 	 e 	 	for	using	up	labor	or	 limit 	 ed 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	in	the	creation	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
here	is	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	train	which	 go 	 es 	 	from	london	to	paris	.
the	question	was	 give 	 n 	 	to	a	bunch	of	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	about	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	``	how	do	we	make	the	journey	to	paris	better	?	``
and	they	came	up	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 engineer 	 ing 	 	solution	,	which	was	to	 s 	 pend 	 	six	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	building	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	 track 	 s 	 	from	london	to	the	coast	,	and	 knock 	 ing 	 	about	40	 minute 	 s 	 	off	a	three	-	and	-	half	-	hour	journey	time	.
now	,	call	me	 mis 	 ter 	 	 pick 	 y 	 	.	i	'm	just	an	ad	man	...
...	but	it	 strike 	 s 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 un 	 imagin 	 ative 	 	way	of	 improv 	 ing 	 	a	train	journey	 mere 	 ly 	 	to	make	it	 short 	 er 	 	.
now	what	is	the	 hedon 	 ic 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	cost	on	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	six	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 rail 	 way 	 	 track 	 s 	 	?
here	is	my	naive	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	man	's	 suggest 	 ion 	 	.
what	you	should	in	fact	do	is	employ	all	of	the	world	's	top	male	and	female	 super 	 model 	 s 	 	,	pay	them	to	walk	the	length	of	the	train	,	 hand 	 ing 	 	out	free	 chat 	 eau 	 	petrus	for	the	entire	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	the	journey	.
now	,	you	'll	still	have	about	three	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	left	in	change	,	and	people	will	ask	for	the	 train 	 s 	 	to	be	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	.
now	,	here	is	 an 	 other 	 	naive	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	man	's	question	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	medical	people	,	scientific	people	,	have	an	obsession	with	solving	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	,	when	 actual 	 ly 	 	most	 problem 	 s 	 	,	once	you	reach	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	level	of	wealth	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	most	 problem 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 per 	 ception 	 	.
so	i	'll	ask	you	 an 	 other 	 	question	.
what	on	earth	is	wrong	with	 place 	 bo 	 s 	 	?
they	seem	fantastic	to	me	.	they	cost	 ver 	 y 	 	little	to	develop	.
they	work	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	well	.
they	have	no	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	or	if	they	do	,	they	're	 imagin 	 ary 	 	,	so	you	can	 safe 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 e 	 	them	.
so	i	was	 discuss 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	to	the	marginal	revolution	blog	by	tyler	cowen	.	i	do	n't	know	if	 any 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	it	.
 some 	 one 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	you	can	take	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	further	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	produce	 place 	 bo 	 	education	.
the	point	is	that	education	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	by	 teach 	 ing 	 	you	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	by	giving	you	the	impression	that	you	've	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	education	,	which	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	 insan 	 e 	 	sense	of	 un 	 warrant 	 ed 	 	self	-	confidence	,	which	then	 make 	 s 	 	you	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	in	 lat 	 er 	 	life	.
so	,	welcome	to	oxford	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
but	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	point	of	 place 	 bo 	 	education	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	of	life	can	be	 solve 	 d 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	by	 tinker 	 ing 	 	with	 per 	 ception 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	that	 ted 	 ious 	 	,	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	and	 mess 	 y 	 	business	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	change	 re 	 ality 	 	?
here	's	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	 histo 	 ry 	 	.	i	've	heard	 th 	 is 	 	 attribut 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	other	 king 	 s 	 	,	but	 do 	 ing 	 	a	bit	of	 historic 	 al 	 	research	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	fredrick	the	great	.
fredrick	the	great	of	prussia	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	keen	for	the	germans	to	adopt	the	potato	and	to	eat	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 real 	 ized 	 	that	if	you	had	two	 source 	 s 	 	of	carbohydrate	,	wheat	and	 potato 	 es 	 	,	you	get	less	price	 volatil 	 ity 	 	in	bread	.
and	you	get	a	far	lower	risk	of	famine	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	two	 crop 	 s 	 	to	fall	back	on	,	not	one	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	problem	is	:	 potato 	 es 	 	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	look	 pre 	 tty 	 	 disgust 	 ing 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	18th	century	prussians	ate	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	--	 ra 	 ther 	 	like	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	scottish	people	.
so	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	he	 tri 	 ed 	 	making	it	 com 	 puls 	 ory 	 	.
the	prussian	 peasant 	 ry 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	ca	n't	even	get	the	 dog 	 s 	 	to	eat	these	damn	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 disgust 	 ing 	 	and	they	're	good	for	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	``
there	are	even	 record 	 s 	 	of	people	 be 	 ing 	 	 execute 	 d 	 	for	 re 	 fusing 	 	to	grow	 potato 	 es 	 	.
so	he	 tri 	 ed 	 	plan	b	.
he	 tri 	 ed 	 	the	 market 	 ing 	 	solution	,	which	is	he	 declare 	 d 	 	the	potato	 a 	 s 	 	a	royal	 veget 	 able 	 	,	and	 non 	 e 	 	but	the	royal	family	could	 consum 	 e 	 	it	.
and	he	 plant 	 ed 	 	it	in	a	royal	potato	patch	,	with	 guard 	 s 	 	who	had	 instruct 	 ions 	 	to	guard	over	it	,	night	and	day	,	but	with	secret	 instruct 	 ions 	 	not	to	guard	it	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
now	,	18th	century	 peasant 	 s 	 	know	that	there	is	one	 pre 	 tty 	 	safe	rule	in	life	,	which	is	if	 some 	 thing 	 	is	worth	 guard 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	worth	 steal 	 ing 	 	.
before	long	,	there	was	a	massive	 under 	 ground 	 	potato	-	growing	operation	in	germany	.
what	he	'd	 effective 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	is	he	'd	re	-	 brand 	 ed 	 	the	potato	.
it	was	an	absolute	 master 	 piece 	 	.
i	told	 th 	 is 	 	story	and	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	from	 tur 	 key 	 	came	up	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 market 	 er 	 	,	fredrick	the	great	.	but	not	a	patch	on	ataturk	.	``
ataturk	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	like	nicolas	sarkozy	,	was	 ver 	 y 	 	keen	to	 dis 	 courage 	 	the	 wear 	 ing 	 	of	a	veil	,	in	 tur 	 key 	 	,	to	 modern 	 ize 	 	it	.
now	,	 bor 	 ing 	 	people	would	have	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	 bann 	 ed 	 	the	veil	.
but	that	would	have	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	a	lot	of	awful	 kick 	 back 	 	and	a	hell	of	a	lot	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
ataturk	was	a	lateral	 think 	 er 	 	.
he	made	it	 com 	 puls 	 ory 	 	for	 prostitute 	 s 	 	to	wear	the	veil	.
i	ca	n't	 ver 	 ify 	 	that	fully	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	matter	.
there	is	your	 environment 	 al 	 	problem	 solve 	 d 	 	,	by	the	way	,	 guy 	 s 	 	:	all	 convict 	 ed 	 	child	 mole 	 sters 	 	have	to	drive	a	porsche	cayenne	.
what	ataturk	 real 	 ized 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	two	 ver 	 y 	 	fundamental	 thing 	 s 	 	.
which	is	that	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	first	one	,	all	value	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	.
all	value	is	 perceive 	 d 	 	value	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	speak	spanish	,	 jug 	 o 	 	de	naranja	--	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	spanish	for	``	 o 	 range 	 	juice	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	not	the	dollar	.	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	peso	in	buenos	aires	.	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	buenos	aires	street	 vend 	 ors 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	practice	price	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	to	the	 detri 	 ment 	 	of	any	 pass 	 ing 	 	 grin 	 go 	 	 tourist 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	man	,	i	have	to	admire	that	.
but	the	first	thing	is	that	all	value	is	 subject 	 ive 	 	.
second	point	is	that	 persuas 	 ion 	 	is	often	better	than	 com 	 pulsion 	 	.
these	funny	 sign 	 s 	 	that	flash	your	speed	at	you	,	some	of	the	new	 one 	 s 	 	,	on	the	bottom	right	,	now	 actual 	 ly 	 	show	a	smiley	face	or	a	 frown 	 y 	 	face	,	to	act	 a 	 s 	 	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	trigger	.
what	's	 fasci 	 nating 	 	about	these	 sign 	 s 	 	is	they	cost	about	10	percent	of	the	running	cost	of	a	 convention 	 al 	 	speed	camera	,	but	they	prevent	twice	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 accident 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	bizarre	thing	,	which	is	 baffl 	 ing 	 	to	 convention 	 al 	 	,	 class 	 ically 	 	trained	 economist 	 s 	 	,	is	that	a	weird	little	smiley	face	 ha 	 s 	 	a	better	effect	on	changing	your	behavior	than	the	threat	of	a	gbp	60	fine	and	three	 penal 	 ty 	 	 point 	 s 	 	.

 be 	 cause 	 	they	found	that	loss	 a 	 version 	 	is	a	more	 power 	 ful 	 	influence	on	people	's	behavior	.
in	britain	we	tend	to	feel	,	``	 who 	 a 	 	!	got	 an 	 other 	 	three	!	``
not	so	in	italy	.
 an 	 other 	 	fantastic	case	of	creating	 in 	 tangible 	 	value	to	replace	actual	or	material	value	,	which	remember	,	is	what	,	after	all	,	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	about	:	 th 	 is 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	is	from	prussia	,	from	,	i	think	,	about	1812	,	1813	.
the	 wealth 	 y 	 	prussians	,	to	help	in	the	war	against	the	french	,	 we 	 re 	 	 encourag 	 ed 	 	to	give	in	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 jewel 	 ry 	 	.
and	it	was	 replace 	 d 	 	with	replica	 jewel 	 ry 	 	made	of	cast	iron	.
here	's	one	:	``	gold	 g 	 ab 	 	ich	für	eisen	,	1813	.	``
the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	for	50	 year 	 s 	 	 h 	 ence 	 	,	the	highest	 stat 	 us 	 	 jewel 	 ry 	 	you	could	wear	in	prussia	was	n't	made	of	gold	or	 diamond 	 s 	 	.
it	was	made	of	cast	iron	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	never	mind	the	actual	intrinsic	value	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	gold	 jewel 	 ry 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 symbol 	 ic 	 	value	,	badge	value	.
it	 s 	 aid 	 	that	your	family	had	made	a	great	sacrifice	in	the	past	.
so	,	the	modern	 equi 	 valent 	 	would	of	course	be	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	there	is	a	thing	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	veblen	 good 	 s 	 	,	where	the	value	of	the	good	 depend 	 s 	 	on	it	 be 	 ing 	 	expensive	and	rare	--	there	are	 oppos 	 ite 	 	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	where	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	value	in	them	 depend 	 s 	 	on	them	 be 	 ing 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	,	 class 	 less 	 	and	 minimal 	 istic 	 	.
if	you	think	about	it	,	shakerism	was	a	proto	-	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
adam	smith	 talk 	 s 	 	about	18th	century	america	,	where	the	 prohibit 	 ion 	 	against	visible	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	of	wealth	was	so	great	,	it	was	 al 	 most 	 	a	block	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	new	england	,	 be 	 cause 	 	even	 wealth 	 y 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	could	find	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	money	on	 with 	 out 	 	 incur 	 ring 	 	the	 dis 	 pleasure 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	possible	to	create	these	social	 pressure 	 s 	 	which	lead	to	more	egalitarian	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
what	's	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	look	at	 product 	 s 	 	that	have	a	high	component	of	what	you	might	call	 mess 	 aging 	 	value	,	a	high	component	of	 in 	 tangible 	 	value	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	intrinsic	value	:	they	are	often	 quit 	 e 	 	egalitarian	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	dress	,	 den 	 im 	 	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	perfect	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 replace 	 s 	 	material	value	with	 symbol 	 ic 	 	value	.
coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	.	a	bunch	of	you	may	be	a	load	of	 pink 	 os 	 	,	and	you	may	not	like	the	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	company	,	but	it	's	worth	 remember 	 ing 	 	andy	warhol	's	point	about	 co 	 ke 	 	.
what	warhol	 s 	 aid 	 	about	 co 	 ke 	 	is	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	about	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	is	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	ca	n't	get	a	better	 co 	 ke 	 	than	the	bum	on	the	corner	of	the	street	.	``
now	,	that	is	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	when	you	think	about	it	--	we	take	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	--	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 remark 	 able 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 	,	to	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	that	 democrat 	 ic 	 	.

and	that	what	we	add	on	top	is	kind	of	false	.	it	's	a	fake	version	.

but	so	much	communication	now	is	contextual	that	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	 actual 	 ly 	 	 nud 	 ging 	 	people	,	for	giving	them	better	information	--	b.j	.	fogg	,	at	the	university	of	stanford	,	 make 	 s 	 	the	point	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	mobile	phone	is	--	he	's	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	phrase	,	``	 persuas 	 ive 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.	``
he	 believ 	 es 	 	the	mobile	phone	,	by	 be 	 ing 	 	location	-	specific	,	contextual	,	 time 	 ly 	 	and	 im 	 mediate 	 	,	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	 persuas 	 ive 	 	technology	 de 	 vice 	 	ever	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	if	we	have	all	these	 tool 	 s 	 	at	our	 dispos 	 al 	 	,	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	have	to	ask	the	question	,	and	thaler	and	sunstein	have	,	of	how	we	can	use	these	more	 intelligent 	 ly 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
if	you	had	a	large	red	button	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	,	on	the	wall	of	your	home	,	and	every	time	you	 press 	 ed 	 	it	,	it	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	50	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	you	,	put	50	 dollar 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	pension	,	you	would	 s 	 ave 	 	a	lot	more	.
the	reason	is	that	the	 inter 	 face 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 determine 	 s 	 	the	behavior	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
now	,	 market 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	job	of	creating	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	impulse	 buy 	 ing 	 	.
yet	we	've	never	 create 	 d 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	impulse	saving	.
if	you	did	 th 	 is 	 	,	more	people	would	 s 	 ave 	 	more	.
it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	question	of	changing	the	 inter 	 face 	 	by	which	people	make	 decision 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	of	the	 decision 	 s 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	i	do	n't	want	people	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	man	i	tend	to	regard	saving	 a 	 s 	 	just	 consumer 	 ism 	 	 need 	 lessly 	 	 postpone 	 d 	 	.
but	if	 any 	 body 	 	did	want	to	do	that	,	that	's	the	kind	of	thing	we	need	to	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	:	fundamental	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	change	human	behavior	.
now	,	i	've	got	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	from	canada	.
there	was	a	young	intern	at	ogilvy	canada	 call 	 ed 	 	hunter	somerville	,	who	was	 work 	 ing 	 	in	improv	in	toronto	,	and	got	a	part	-	time	job	in	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	and	was	 give 	 n 	 	the	job	of	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	shreddies	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	perfect	case	of	creating	 in 	 tangible 	 	,	 add 	 ed 	 	value	,	 with 	 out 	 	changing	the	product	in	the	 s 	 light 	 est 	 	.
shreddies	is	a	strange	,	square	,	whole	-	grain	 ce 	 real 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	in	new	zealand	,	canada	and	britain	.
it	's	kraft	's	peculiar	way	of	 reward 	 ing 	 	 loyal 	 ty 	 	to	the	crown	.
in	 work 	 ing 	 	out	how	you	could	re	-	launch	shreddies	,	he	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
video	:	man	:	shreddies	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	square	.
woman	:	have	any	of	these	diamond	 shape 	 s 	 	gone	out	?
voiceover	:	new	diamond	shreddies	 ce 	 real 	 	.
same	100	percent	whole	-	grain	wheat	in	a	 delic 	 ious 	 	diamond	shape	.
rory	sutherland	:	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	the	most	perfect	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 in 	 tangible 	 	value	creation	.	all	it	 requir 	 es 	 	is	 photo 	 ns 	 	,	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	and	a	great	idea	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
i	would	say	it	's	a	work	of	 gen 	 ius 	 	.
but	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	you	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	 with 	 out 	 	a	little	bit	of	market	research	.
man	:	so	,	shreddies	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	producing	a	new	product	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	for	them	.
so	they	are	 introduc 	 ing 	 	new	diamond	shreddies	.
so	i	just	want	to	get	your	first	 impression 	 s 	 	when	you	see	that	,	when	you	see	the	diamond	shreddies	box	there	.
woman	:	 we 	 re 	 	n't	they	square	?
woman	#	2	:	i	'm	a	little	bit	 con 	 fused 	 	.	woman	#	3	:	they	look	like	the	 square 	 s 	 	to	me	.
man	:	they	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	all	in	the	 appear 	 ance 	 	.
but	it	's	kind	of	like	 flip 	 ping 	 	a	six	or	a	nine	.	like	a	six	,	if	you	flip	it	over	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	nine	.
but	a	six	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	a	nine	.
woman	#	3	:	or	an	``	m	``	and	a	``	w	``	.	man	:	an	``	m	``	and	a	``	w	``	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
man	#	2	:	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	you	just	 look 	 ed 	 	like	you	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	on	 it 	 s 	 	end	.	but	when	you	see	it	like	that	it	's	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	looking	.
man	:	just	try	both	of	them	.
take	a	square	one	there	,	first	.
man	:	which	one	did	you	prefer	?	man	#	2	:	the	first	one	.
man	:	the	first	one	?
rory	sutherland	:	now	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	a	debate	 rag 	 ed 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 conserv 	 ative 	 	 element 	 s 	 	in	canada	,	 un 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 resent 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 tru 	 s 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	a	 com 	 promise 	 	,	which	was	the	 com 	 bo 	 	pack	.
if	you	think	it	's	funny	,	bear	in	mind	there	is	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	american	institute	of	wine	 economic 	 s 	 	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 extens 	 ive 	 	research	 in 	 to 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	 discover 	 s 	 	that	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	among	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	five	or	ten	percent	of	the	most	 knowledge 	 able 	 	people	,	there	is	no	correlation	between	quality	and	 enjoy 	 ment 	 	in	wine	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	when	you	tell	the	people	how	expensive	it	is	,	in	which	case	they	tend	to	enjoy	the	more	expensive	stuff	more	.
so	drink	your	wine	blind	in	the	future	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	both	 hyster 	 ically 	 	funny	--	but	i	think	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	point	,	which	is	,	going	forward	,	we	need	more	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	value	.
we	need	to	 s 	 pend 	 	more	time	 appreci 	 ating 	 	what	 al 	 ready 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	,	and	less	time	 agon 	 izing 	 	over	what	else	we	can	do	.
two	 quota 	 tions 	 	to	more	or	less	end	with	.
one	of	them	is	,	``	 poet 	 ry 	 	is	when	you	make	new	 thing 	 s 	 	familiar	and	familiar	 thing 	 s 	 	new	.	``
which	is	n't	a	bad	definition	of	what	our	job	is	,	to	help	people	appreciate	what	is	 un 	 familiar 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	gain	a	 great 	 er 	 	 appreci 	 ation 	 	,	and	place	a	far	 high 	 er 	 	value	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	which	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 exist 	 ing 	 	.
there	is	some	evidence	,	by	the	way	,	that	 thing 	 s 	 	like	social	 network 	 ing 	 	help	do	that	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	help	people	share	news	.
they	give	badge	value	to	 every 	 day 	 	little	trivial	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
so	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	need	for	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	great	money	on	 dis 	 play 	 	,	and	 in 	 crease 	 	the	kind	of	third	-	party	 enjoy 	 ment 	 	you	can	get	from	the	 small 	 est 	 	,	 simpl 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	life	.	which	is	magic	.
the	second	one	is	the	second	g.k.	chesterton	quote	of	 th 	 is 	 	session	,	which	is	,	``	we	are	 perish 	 ing 	 	for	want	of	wonder	,	not	for	want	of	 wonder 	 s 	 	,	``	which	i	think	for	 any 	 body 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	technology	,	is	 perfect 	 ly 	 	true	.
and	a	final	thing	:	when	you	place	a	value	on	 thing 	 s 	 	like	health	,	love	,	 s 	 ex 	 	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	learn	to	place	a	material	value	on	what	you	've	 previous 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 count 	 ed 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 mere 	 ly 	 	 in 	 tangible 	 	,	a	thing	not	 s 	 een 	 	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	you	're	much	,	much	 wealth 	 ier 	 	than	you	ever	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
