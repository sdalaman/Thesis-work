it	's	not	about	technology	,	it	's	about	people	and	 st 	 ories 	 	.
i	could	show	you	what	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	was	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	high	quality	video	:	60	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	it	.
and	it	was	the	now	director	of	the	entire	piece	of	the	veteran	's	 administr 	 ation 	 	--	who	,	 him 	 self 	 	,	had	lost	an	arm	39	 year 	 s 	 	ago	who	was	 adamant 	 ly 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	these	crazy	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	work	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	with	60	 minute 	 s 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	after	he	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	made	his	position	clear	on	 th 	 is 	 	--	he	had	his	hook	and	he	had	his	--	he	 wo 	 re 	 	 th 	 is 	 	arm	for	less	than	two	 hour 	 s 	 	and	was	able	to	pour	 him 	 self 	 	a	drink	and	got	 quit 	 e 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	over	the	fact	that	,	quote	--	his	quote	--	it	's	the	first	time	he	's	felt	like	he	's	had	an	arm	in	39	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	that	would	sort	of	be	 jump 	 ing 	 	to	the	middle	of	the	story	,	and	i	'm	not	going	to	show	you	that	 polish 	 ed 	 	video	.
i	'm	going	to	,	 in 	 stead 	 	,	in	a	minute	or	two	,	show	you	an	early	,	 crud 	 e 	 	video	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	's	a	better	way	to	tell	a	story	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	was	 visit 	 ed 	 	by	the	guy	that	 run 	 s 	 	darpa	,	the	people	that	fund	all	the	 advance 	 d 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	 business 	 es 	 	and	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	n't	take	the	risk	of	 do 	 ing 	 	.
they	have	a	 part 	 icular 	 	interest	in	 one 	 s 	 	that	will	help	our	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
i	get	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 un 	 request 	 ed 	 	--	by	me	 any 	 way 	 	--	visit	,	and	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	my	 con 	 ference 	 	room	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	senior	surgeon	from	the	 militar 	 y 	 	and	the	guy	that	 run 	 s 	 	darpa	.
they	proceed	to	tell	me	a	story	which	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	.	we	have	used	 s 	 uch 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	now	and	made	them	 avail 	 able 	 	in	the	most	remote	 place 	 s 	 	that	we	put	 soldier 	 s 	 	:	 hill 	 s 	 	of	afghanistan	,	 ir 	 aq 	 	...
they	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	proud	of	the	fact	that	you	know	,	before	the	dust	 clear 	 s 	 	,	if	some	soldier	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	hurt	they	will	have	 collect 	 ed 	 	him	or	her	,	they	will	have	 br 	 ought 	 	him	back	,	they	will	be	 get 	 ting 	 	world	-	class	 tri 	 age 	 	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	care	 fast 	 er 	 	than	you	and	i	would	be	 get 	 ting 	 	it	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	hurt	in	a	car	accident	in	a	major	city	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	good	news	.
the	bad	news	is	if	they	've	 collect 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	person	and	he	or	she	is	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	an	arm	or	leg	,	part	of	the	face	,	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	coming	back	.
so	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	giving	me	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	on	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 kid 	 s 	 	had	lost	an	arm	.
and	then	the	surgeon	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	with	a	lot	of	anger	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	is	it	?	at	the	end	of	the	civil	war	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	each	other	with	 mus 	 ket 	 s 	 	.	if	 some 	 body 	 	lost	an	arm	,	we	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	 wood 	 en 	 	stick	with	a	hook	on	it	.
now	we	've	got	f	18s	and	f	22s	,	and	if	 some 	 body 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	an	arm	,	we	give	them	a	plastic	stick	with	a	hook	on	it	.	``
and	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	,	``	and	then	the	 punch 	 line 	 	:	``	so	,	dean	,	we	're	here	 be 	 cause 	 	you	make	medical	stuff	.
you	're	going	to	give	us	an	arm	.	``
and	i	was	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	500	 page 	 s 	 	of	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	,	 paper 	 work 	 	and	dods	.
no	,	the	guy	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	we	're	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	guy	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	room	,	and	 wear 	 ing 	 	the	arm	you	're	going	to	give	us	,	he	or	she	is	going	to	pick	up	a	raisin	or	a	grape	off	 th 	 is 	 	table	.
if	it	's	the	grape	,	they	wo	n't	break	it	.	``
great	he	 need 	 s 	 	 effe 	 rent 	 	,	 affe 	 rent 	 	,	 hap 	 tic 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	.
``	if	it	's	the	raisin	,	they	wo	n't	drop	it	.	``
so	he	 want 	 s 	 	fine	motor	control	:	flex	at	the	wrist	,	flex	at	the	elbow	,	abduct	and	flex	at	the	shoulder	.
either	way	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	eat	it	.
``	oh	,	by	the	way	dean	.	it	's	going	to	fit	on	a	50th	 percent 	 ile 	 	female	frame	--	 name 	 ly 	 	32	 inch 	 es 	 	from	the	long	finger	--	and	weigh	less	than	nine	 pound 	 s 	 	.	``

``	and	it	's	going	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	self	 contain 	 ed 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	all	 it 	 s 	 	power	.	``
so	,	they	 finish 	 ed 	 	that	.	and	i	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	tell	,	am	a	 bash 	 ful 	 	guy	.
i	told	them	they	're	nuts	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	too	much	``	terminator	.	``
then	,	the	surgeon	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	,	``	dean	,	you	need	to	know	more	than	two	dozen	of	these	 kid 	 s 	 	have	come	back	 bi 	 lateral 	 	.	``
now	,	i	can	not	imagine	--	i	'm	sorry	,	you	may	have	a	better	 imagin 	 ation 	 	than	i	do	--	i	ca	n't	imagine	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	my	arm	,	and	 typical 	 ly 	 	at	22	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
but	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	that	,	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	two	?
 seem 	 s 	 	like	that	would	be	an	 in 	 convenience 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	went	home	that	night	.	i	thought	about	it	.
i	 liter 	 ally 	 	could	not	sleep	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	``	i	wonder	how	you	'd	roll	over	with	no	 shoulder 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	we	've	got	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	trust	me	,	i	've	got	a	day	job	,	i	've	got	a	lot	of	day	 job 	 s 	 	.
most	of	my	day	job	 keep 	 s 	 	me	 bus 	 y 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	my	 fanta 	 s 	 ies 	 	like	first	and	water	and	power	...	.
and	i	've	got	a	lot	of	day	 job 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	i	got	ta	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
did	a	little	investigation	,	went	down	to	washington	,	told	them	i	still	think	they	're	nuts	but	we	're	going	to	do	it	.
and	i	told	them	i	'd	build	them	an	arm	.
i	told	them	it	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	take	five	 year 	 s 	 	to	get	through	the	fda	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	to	be	 reason 	 ably 	 	functional	.
look	what	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	like	ipods	.
``	great	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	got	two	 year 	 s 	 	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	tell	you	what	.	i	'll	build	you	an	arm	that	's	under	nine	 pound 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	all	that	 cap 	 ability 	 	in	one	year	.
it	will	take	the	other	nine	to	make	it	functional	and	 use 	 ful 	 	.	``
we	sort	of	 agree 	 d 	 	to	disagree	.
i	went	back	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	a	team	together	,	the	best	 guy 	 s 	 	i	could	find	with	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
at	the	end	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	one	year	we	had	a	 de 	 vice 	 	with	14	 degree 	 s 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	,	all	the	 sensor 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 micro 	 processor 	 s 	 	,	all	the	stuff	 in 	 side 	 	.
i	could	show	you	it	with	a	 cosm 	 es 	 is 	 	on	it	that	's	so	real	it	's	 eer 	 ie 	 	,	but	then	you	would	n't	see	all	 th 	 is 	 	cool	stuff	.
i	then	thought	it	would	be	 year 	 s 	 	before	we	'd	be	able	to	make	it	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	think	you	could	see	in	aimee	's	 cap 	 abilities 	 	and	 attitude 	 s 	 	,	people	with	a	 desir 	 e 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	and	nature	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 adapt 	 able 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	with	less	than	10	 hour 	 s 	 	of	use	,	two	 guy 	 s 	 	--	one	that	's	 bi 	 lateral 	 	.
he	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	he	's	got	no	shoulder	on	one	side	,	and	he	's	high	trans	-	humeral	on	the	other	.
and	that	's	chuck	and	randy	together	,	after	10	 hour 	 s 	 	--	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	in	our	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	we	took	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 crud 	 dy 	 	home	 movie 	 s 	 	.
at	the	end	of	the	one	i	'm	going	to	show	,	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	a	minute	and	a	couple	of	 second 	 s 	 	long	,	chuck	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	i	'm	jealous	of	,	i	ca	n't	do	it	.
he	 pick 	 s 	 	up	a	spoon	,	 pick 	 s 	 	it	up	,	 scoop 	 s 	 	out	some	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	wheat	and	milk	,	 hold 	 s 	 	the	spoon	level	 a 	 s 	 	he	 transl 	 ates 	 	it	,	moving	all	these	 joint 	 s 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	to	his	mouth	,	and	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	drop	any	milk	.
i	can	not	do	that	.
his	wife	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	me	.
she	's	 stand 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	me	at	the	time	and	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	dean	,	chuck	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	fed	 him 	 self 	 	in	19	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	've	got	a	choice	:	we	keep	the	arm	,	or	you	keep	chuck	.	``
so	,	can	we	see	that	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	chuck	 show 	 ing 	 	simultaneous	control	of	all	the	 joint 	 s 	 	.
he	's	 punch 	 ing 	 	our	 control 	 s 	 	guy	.	the	guy	 be 	 hind 	 	him	is	our	engineer	/	surgeon	,	which	is	a	convenient	guy	to	have	around	.
there	's	randy	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 pass 	 ing 	 	a	rubber	little	puck	between	them	.
and	just	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	spirit	of	first	,	 gr 	 acious 	 	 professional 	 ism 	 	,	they	are	 quit 	 e 	 	proud	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	they	decide	to	share	a	drink	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	non	-	trivial	thing	to	do	,	by	the	way	.
imagine	 do 	 ing 	 	that	with	a	 wood 	 en 	 	stick	and	a	hook	on	the	end	of	it	,	 do 	 ing 	 	either	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
now	chuck	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	my	 limit 	 ed 	 	physical	skill	.
and	now	he	's	going	to	do	what	darpa	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	for	.
he	's	going	to	pick	up	a	grape	--	he	did	n't	drop	it	,	he	did	n't	break	it	--	and	he	's	going	to	eat	it	.
so	,	that	's	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	end	of	about	15	 month 	 s 	 	.
but	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	richard	,	the	technology	,	the	 processor 	 s 	 	,	the	 sensor 	 s 	 	,	the	 motor 	 s 	 	,	is	not	the	story	.

he	had	one	good	eye	.
his	name	is	brandon	marrocco	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	need	your	 arm 	 s 	 	,	but	i	need	two	of	them	.	``
``	you	'll	get	them	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	kid	was	from	staten	 is 	 land 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	had	a	truck	,	before	i	went	over	there	,	and	it	had	a	stick	.
you	think	i	'll	be	able	to	drive	it	?	``
``	 s 	 ure 	 	.	``
and	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	and	went	,	``	how	are	we	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
 any 	 way 	 	,	he	was	just	like	all	the	rest	of	them	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	a	lot	.
he	 want 	 s 	 	to	help	.	he	told	me	that	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	back	to	help	his	 bud 	 dies 	 	.
so	,	i	was	on	my	way	out	here	.
i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	stop	at	texas	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	3,500	people	,	the	veteran	's	 administr 	 ation 	 	,	u.s.	...	just	3,500	at	 th 	 is 	 	huge	event	to	help	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	of	all	the	 kid 	 s 	 	--	some	that	have	 di 	 ed 	 	,	some	that	are	like	brandon	--	and	they	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	speak	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	am	i	going	to	say	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	happy	thing	.	look	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	you	,	i	can	give	you	...	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	still	not	 a 	 s 	 	good	at	the	original	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.	``
``	you	need	to	come	.	``
so	,	i	went	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	think	you	get	the	point	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	people	there	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	.
some	further	 a 	 long 	 	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
but	 universal 	 ly 	 	,	these	people	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	had	 astound 	 ing 	 	 attitude 	 s 	 	,	and	just	the	fact	that	people	care	 make 	 s 	 	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	to	them	.
i	'll	shut	up	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	one	 mess 	 age 	 	or	concern	i	have	.
i	do	n't	think	 any 	 body 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	 intentional 	 ly 	 	,	but	there	 we 	 re 	 	people	there	 liter 	 ally 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	``	well	,	how	much	will	they	get	?	``
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	country	is	 involve 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	all	heard	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	great	 health 	 care 	 	debate	.
``	who	is	 en 	 titled 	 	to	what	?
who	is	 en 	 titled 	 	to	how	much	?
who	is	going	to	pay	for	it	?	``
 t 	 hose 	 	are	tough	 question 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	an	answer	to	that	.	not	 every 	 body 	 	can	be	 en 	 titled 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	born	here	.
it	's	not	possible	.	it	would	be	nice	but	let	's	be	realistic	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	tough	 question 	 s 	 	.	there	's	 polar 	 ized 	 	 group 	 s 	 	down	there	.
i	do	n't	know	the	 answer 	 s 	 	.
there	are	other	 question 	 s 	 	that	are	tough	.
``	should	we	be	there	?
how	do	we	get	out	?
what	do	we	need	to	do	?	``	there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 polar 	 ized 	 	 answer 	 s 	 	to	that	question	too	,	and	i	do	n't	have	any	 answer 	 s 	 	to	that	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 politic 	 al 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	economic	 question 	 s 	 	,	 strat 	 egic 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	the	answer	.	but	let	me	give	you	a	simple	concern	or	 may 	 be 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	,	then	.
it	is	an	easy	answer	.
i	know	what	these	 kid 	 s 	 	deserve	on	the	 health 	 care 	 	side	.
i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	one	of	them	,	and	he	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 lik 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	arm	--	it	's	way	,	way	,	way	better	than	a	plastic	stick	with	a	hook	on	it	--	but	there	's	 no 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	that	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	have	that	than	the	one	you	got	.
but	i	was	 say 	 ing 	 	to	him	,	``	you	know	,	the	first	 air 	 plane 	 	went	100	feet	in	1903	.
wilbur	and	orville	.
but	you	know	what	?	it	would	n't	have	made	an	old	pigeon	jealous	.
but	now	we	got	 eagle 	 s 	 	out	there	,	f	15s	,	even	that	bald	eagle	.
i	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	bird	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	at	mach	2	.
i	think	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	we	'll	make	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	that	kid	,	``	i	'll	stop	when	your	 bud 	 dies 	 	are	 en 	 vi 	 ous 	 	of	your	luke	arm	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	it	can	do	,	and	how	it	 do 	 es 	 	it	.
and	we	'll	keep	 work 	 ing 	 	.	and	i	'm	not	going	to	stop	 work 	 ing 	 	 un 	 til 	 	we	do	that	.	``
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	country	ought	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 it 	 s 	 	great	debate	,	 whin 	 ing 	 	and	 complain 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	'm	 en 	 titled 	 	.	``	``	you	're	a	victim	.	``
and	 whin 	 ing 	 	and	 complain 	 ing 	 	about	what	our	foreign	policy	ought	to	be	.
but	while	we	have	the	 luxur 	 y 	 	of	 whin 	 ing 	 	and	 complain 	 ing 	 	about	who	's	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	what	and	how	much	we	get	,	the	people	that	are	out	there	giving	us	that	great	privilege	of	 whin 	 ing 	 	and	 complain 	 ing 	 	,	i	know	what	they	deserve	:	 every 	 thing 	 	 human 	 ly 	 	possible	.
and	we	ought	to	give	it	to	them	.
