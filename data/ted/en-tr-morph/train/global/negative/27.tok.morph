my	name	is	lovegrove	.	i	 on 	 ly 	 	know	nine	lovegroves	,	two	of	which	are	my	 parent 	 s 	 	.
they	are	first	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	and	you	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	,	you	know	--	so	there	's	a	 terr 	 ibly 	 	weird	 freak 	 y 	 	side	to	me	,	which	i	'm	 fight 	 ing 	 	with	all	the	time	.	so	to	try	and	get	through	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	've	kind	of	 discipline 	 d 	 	 my 	 self 	 	with	an	18	-	minute	talk	.
i	was	 hang 	 ing 	 	on	to	have	a	 pe 	 e 	 	.
i	thought	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	if	i	was	 hang 	 ing 	 	on	long	 en 	 ough 	 	,	that	would	guide	me	through	the	18	 minute 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	i	am	known	 a 	 s 	 	 cap 	 tain 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	and	that	's	a	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	position	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	an	aesthetic	position	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	to	you	about	is	that	love	of	form	and	how	form	can	touch	people	's	soul	and	emotion	.
not	 ver 	 y 	 	long	ago	,	not	 man 	 y 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	lived	in	 cave 	 s 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	think	we	've	lost	that	 cod 	 ing 	 	system	.
we	respond	so	well	to	form	,	but	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	creating	intelligent	form	.
i	'm	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	at	all	in	 blob 	 ism 	 	or	any	of	that	 super 	 ficial 	 	 rub 	 b 	 ish 	 	that	you	see	coming	out	 a 	 s 	 	design	.
these	--	 th 	 is 	 	 artificial 	 ly 	 	induced	 consumer 	 ism 	 	--	i	think	it	's	 atro 	 c 	 ious 	 	.
my	world	is	the	world	of	people	like	amory	lovins	,	janine	benyus	,	james	watson	.
i	'm	in	that	world	,	but	i	work	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	 instinct 	 ively 	 	.
i	'm	not	a	scientist	.	i	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	but	i	work	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	where	i	trust	my	 instinct 	 s 	 	.
so	i	am	a	21st	-	century	 transl 	 ator 	 	of	technology	 in 	 to 	 	 product 	 s 	 	that	we	use	 every 	 day 	 	and	 re 	 late 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	and	 natural 	 ly 	 	with	.
and	we	should	be	 develop 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	we	should	be	 develop 	 ing 	 	 pack 	 aging 	 	for	 idea 	 s 	 	which	 elev 	 ate 	 	people	's	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	and	respect	for	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	dig	out	of	the	earth	and	 transl 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 product 	 s 	 	for	 every 	 day 	 	use	.
so	,	the	water	bottle	.
i	'll	begin	with	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	what	i	call	dna	.
dna	:	design	,	nature	,	art	.	these	are	the	three	 thing 	 s 	 	that	condition	my	world	.
here	is	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	by	leonardo	da	vinci	,	500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	before	 photograph 	 y 	 	.
it	 show 	 s 	 	how	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	curiosity	and	instinct	work	to	create	 amaz 	 ing 	 	art	.
industrial	design	is	the	art	form	of	the	21st	century	.
people	like	leonardo	--	there	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	--	had	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 instinct 	 ive 	 	curiosity	.
i	work	from	a	similar	position	.
i	do	n't	want	to	sound	 pre 	 tent 	 ious 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 draw 	 ing 	 	made	on	a	digital	pad	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	well	 in 	 to 	 	the	21st	century	,	500	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
it	's	my	impression	of	water	.
impressionism	 be 	 ing 	 	the	most	 valu 	 able 	 	art	form	on	the	planet	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	:	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 eas 	 ily 	 	,	for	a	monet	.
i	use	,	now	,	a	whole	new	process	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	 re 	 invent 	 ed 	 	my	process	to	keep	up	with	people	like	greg	lynn	,	tom	main	,	zaha	hadid	,	rem	koolhaas	--	all	these	people	that	i	think	are	 persever 	 ing 	 	and	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	with	fantastic	new	 idea 	 s 	 	of	how	to	create	form	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 create 	 d 	 	 digital 	 ly 	 	.
here	you	see	the	 ma 	 chin 	 ing 	 	,	the	 mill 	 ing 	 	of	a	block	of	 a 	 cry 	 lic 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	show	to	the	client	to	say	,	``	that	's	what	i	want	to	do	.	``
at	that	point	,	i	do	n't	know	if	that	's	possible	at	all	.
it	's	a	 s 	 educ 	 tor 	 	,	but	i	just	feel	in	my	 bone 	 s 	 	that	that	's	possible	.
so	we	go	.	we	look	at	the	 tool 	 ing 	 	.	we	look	at	how	that	is	 produce 	 d 	 	.
these	are	the	 in 	 visible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	never	see	in	your	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 back 	 ground 	 	noise	of	industrial	design	.
that	is	like	an	anish	kapoor	 flow 	 ing 	 	through	a	richard	serra	.
it	is	more	 valu 	 able 	 	than	the	product	in	my	 eye 	 s 	 	.	i	do	n't	have	one	.
when	i	do	make	some	money	,	i	'll	have	one	 machine 	 d 	 	for	 my 	 self 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	final	product	.	when	they	 s 	 ent 	 	it	to	me	,	i	thought	i	'd	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
it	felt	like	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	feel	like	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	when	i	put	the	water	in	that	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	'd	put	a	skin	on	water	 it 	 self 	 	.
it	's	an	icon	of	water	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	it	 elev 	 ates 	 	people	's	 per 	 ception 	 	of	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	design	.
each	bottle	is	different	,	meaning	the	water	level	will	give	you	a	different	shape	.
it	's	mass	 individual 	 ism 	 	from	a	single	product	.	it	 fit 	 s 	 	the	hand	.
it	 fit 	 s 	 	 arthri 	 tic 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.	it	 fit 	 s 	 	children	's	 hand 	 s 	 	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	the	product	strong	,	the	 tes 	 sell 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	a	 mill 	 efiori 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
in	the	future	they	will	look	like	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	need	to	move	away	from	 t 	 hose 	 	type	of	 polymer 	 s 	 	and	use	that	for	medical	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	in	life	.
 bio 	 polymer 	 s 	 	,	these	new	 idea 	 s 	 	for	 material 	 s 	 	,	will	come	 in 	 to 	 	play	in	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	decade	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	 a 	 s 	 	cool	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	?
but	i	can	live	up	to	that	.	i	do	n't	have	a	problem	with	that	.
i	design	for	that	condition	,	 bio 	 polymer 	 s 	 	.	it	's	the	future	.
i	took	 th 	 is 	 	video	in	cape	town	last	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 freak 	 y 	 	side	coming	out	.
i	have	 th 	 is 	 	special	interest	in	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	which	blow	my	mind	.
i	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	to	,	you	know	,	drop	to	my	 knee 	 s 	 	,	cry	;	i	do	n't	know	what	i	think	.	but	i	just	know	that	nature	 improve 	 s 	 	with	ever	-	 great 	 er 	 	purpose	that	which	once	 exist 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	 strange 	 ness 	 	is	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	 innov 	 ative 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
when	i	look	at	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	look	 pre 	 tty 	 	normal	to	me	.
but	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	over	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	now	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	--	i	get	three	 week 	 s 	 	to	design	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	.
how	the	hell	do	i	do	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	in	three	 week 	 s 	 	,	when	you	get	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	take	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	million	 year 	 s 	 	to	evolve	?
how	do	you	 condens 	 e 	 	that	?
it	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	instinct	.
i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 design 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	that	look	like	that	,	and	i	'm	not	looking	at	 design 	 ing 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	like	that	.
i	'm	just	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	natural	growth	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 form 	 s 	 	that	 on 	 ly 	 	nature	 re 	 ally 	 	 create 	 s 	 	.
how	that	 flow 	 s 	 	through	me	and	how	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	is	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 can 	 	through	the	human	 fore 	 arm 	 	.	it	's	then	blown	up	through	rapid	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	to	reveal	the	cellular	structure	.	i	have	these	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	.
my	 off 	 ice 	 	is	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	the	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	museum	and	a	nasa	space	lab	.
it	's	a	weird	,	kind	of	 freak 	 y 	 	place	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 specimen 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	made	--	bone	is	made	from	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 mineral 	 s 	 	and	 polymer 	 s 	 	.
i	 stud 	 ied 	 	 cook 	 ing 	 	in	school	for	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	in	that	experience	,	which	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	domestic	science	,	``	it	was	a	bit	of	a	cheap	trick	for	me	to	try	and	get	a	science	 qual 	 ification 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	put	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	in	 every 	 thing 	 	i	 cook 	 ed 	 	--	--	and	i	had	access	to	all	the	best	 girl 	 s 	 	.	it	was	fabulous	.
all	the	 guy 	 s 	 	in	the	 rug 	 by 	 	team	could	n't	understand	,	but	 any 	 way 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 mer 	 ing 	 ue 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 s 	 ample 	 	i	have	.
a	 mer 	 ing 	 ue 	 	is	made	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	,	in	my	estimation	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	bone	.
it	's	made	from	 poly 	 sac 	 cha 	 ride 	 s 	 	and	 protein 	 s 	 	.
if	you	pour	water	on	that	,	it	 dis 	 solve 	 s 	 	.
could	we	be	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	from	 food 	 stuff 	 s 	 	in	the	future	?
not	a	bad	idea	.	i	do	n't	know	.	i	need	to	talk	to	janine	and	a	few	other	people	about	that	,	but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 instinct 	 ively 	 	that	that	 mer 	 ing 	 ue 	 	can	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	a	car	--	i	do	n't	know	.
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	growth	 pattern 	 s 	 	:	the	 un 	 brid 	 led 	 	way	that	nature	 grow 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	so	you	're	not	 restrict 	 ed 	 	by	form	at	all	.
these	 inter 	 related 	 	 form 	 s 	 	,	they	do	inspire	 every 	 thing 	 	i	do	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	might	end	up	making	 some 	 thing 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	simple	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	detail	of	a	chair	that	i	've	designed	in	 magn 	 es 	 ium 	 	.
it	 show 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 locu 	 tion 	 	of	 element 	 s 	 	and	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	kind	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	 bio 	 logical 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 show 	 n 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	a	bone	structure	.
any	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 element 	 s 	 	you	could	sort	of	hang	on	the	wall	 a 	 s 	 	some	kind	of	art	object	.
it	's	the	world	's	first	chair	made	in	 magn 	 es 	 ium 	 	.
it	cost	1.7	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	develop	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	go	``	by	bernhardt	,	usa	.
it	went	 in 	 to 	 	time	magazine	in	2001	 a 	 s 	 	the	new	language	of	the	21st	century	.
boy	.	for	 some 	 body 	 	growing	up	in	wales	in	a	little	village	,	that	's	 en 	 ough 	 	.
it	 show 	 s 	 	how	you	make	one	 hol 	 istic 	 	form	,	like	the	car	industry	,	and	then	you	break	up	what	you	need	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	way	of	 work 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	a	 god 	 ly 	 	way	of	 work 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 organ 	 ic 	 	and	it	's	essential	.
it	's	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fat	-	free	design	,	and	when	you	look	at	it	,	you	see	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	bless	you	.
when	that	 move 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 polymer 	 s 	 	,	you	can	change	the	 elastic 	 ity 	 	,	the	 fluid 	 ity 	 	of	the	form	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	idea	for	a	gas	-	 inject 	 ed 	 	,	one	-	piece	polymer	chair	.
what	nature	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 drill 	 s 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	in	 thing 	 s 	 	.	it	 liberate 	 s 	 	form	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	away	 any 	 thing 	 	 extra 	 ne 	 ous 	 	.	that	's	what	i	do	.
i	make	 organ 	 ic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	which	are	essential	.
i	do	n't	--	and	they	look	 funk 	 y 	 	too	--	but	i	do	n't	set	out	to	make	 funk 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	that	's	an	absolute	 dis 	 grace 	 	.
i	set	out	to	look	at	natural	 form 	 s 	 	.
if	you	took	the	idea	of	 fract 	 al 	 	technology	further	,	take	a	membrane	,	 shrink 	 ing 	 	it	down	 constant 	 ly 	 	like	nature	 do 	 es 	 	--	that	could	be	a	seat	for	a	chair	;	it	could	be	a	sole	for	a	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	shoe	;	it	could	be	a	car	 blend 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 seat 	 s 	 	.
 w 	 ow 	 	.	let	's	go	for	it	.	that	's	the	kind	of	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 exist 	 s 	 	in	nature	.	 observ 	 ation 	 	now	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	 br 	 ing 	 	that	natural	process	 in 	 to 	 	the	design	process	every	day	.	that	's	what	i	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	show	that	's	 current 	 ly 	 	on	in	tokyo	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	superliquidity	.	``	it	's	my	 sculpt 	 ural 	 	investigation	.
it	's	like	21st	-	century	henry	moore	.	when	you	see	a	henry	moore	still	,	your	hair	 stand 	 s 	 	up	.	there	's	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	spiritual	connect	.
if	he	was	a	car	 design 	 er 	 	,	 p 	 hew 	 	,	we	'd	all	be	 driv 	 ing 	 	one	.
in	his	day	,	he	was	the	highest	taxpayer	in	britain	.
that	is	the	power	of	 organ 	 ic 	 	design	.
it	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	 immense 	 ly 	 	to	our	sense	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,	our	sense	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	,	our	 sensual 	 ity 	 	and	,	you	know	,	the	sort	of	--	even	the	sort	of	socio	-	 er 	 otic 	 	side	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 art 	 work 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	my	process	.
these	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 art 	 work 	 	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 print 	 s 	 	.	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	i	get	to	that	object	.
 iron 	 ically 	 	,	that	object	was	made	by	the	killarney	process	,	which	is	a	brand	-	new	process	here	for	the	21st	century	,	and	i	can	hear	greg	lynn	 laugh 	 ing 	 	his	 sock 	 s 	 	off	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	that	.
i	'll	tell	you	about	that	 lat 	 er 	 	.
when	i	look	 in 	 to 	 	these	data	 image 	 s 	 	,	i	see	new	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	self	--	it	's	self	-	inspired	.	 di 	 atomic 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	,	 radio 	 l 	 aria 	 	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	could	n't	see	but	we	can	do	now	--	these	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	are	 cor 	 ed 	 	out	.	they	're	made	 virtual 	 ly 	 	from	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
they	're	made	from	silica	.	why	not	 structure 	 s 	 	from	 car 	 s 	 	like	that	?
coral	,	all	these	natural	 force 	 s 	 	,	take	away	what	they	do	n't	need	and	they	deliver	 maxim 	 um 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
we	need	to	be	in	that	realm	.	i	want	to	do	stuff	like	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	chair	which	should	come	on	the	market	in	september	.
it	's	for	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	moroso	in	italy	.
it	's	a	gas	-	 inject 	 ed 	 	polymer	chair	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	you	see	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 filter 	 ed 	 	-	down	,	 water 	 ed 	 	-	down	 version 	 s 	 	of	the	 extrem 	 ity 	 	of	the	 di 	 atomic 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	with	the	flow	of	the	polymer	and	you	'll	see	--	there	's	an	image	coming	up	right	now	that	 show 	 s 	 	the	full	thing	.
it	's	great	to	have	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	italy	who	support	 th 	 is 	 	way	of	 dream 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	see	the	 shadow 	 s 	 	that	come	through	that	,	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	the	product	,	but	it	's	the	 minim 	 um 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	.
the	 cor 	 ing 	 	out	of	the	back	lets	you	breathe	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	away	any	material	you	do	n't	need	and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 gar 	 ner 	 s 	 	 flex 	 ure 	 	too	,	so	--	i	was	going	to	break	 in 	 to 	 	a	dance	then	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	current	work	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	looking	at	single	-	surface	 structure 	 s 	 	and	how	they	flow	--	how	they	stretch	and	flow	.	it	's	based	on	furniture	 typo 	 logies 	 	,	but	that	's	not	the	end	 motiv 	 ation 	 	.	it	's	made	from	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 a 	 lumin 	 ium 	 	,	and	it	's	grown	.
it	's	grown	in	my	mind	,	and	then	it	's	grown	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	whole	process	that	i	go	through	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	in	ccp	in	coventry	,	who	build	 part 	 s 	 	for	bentleys	and	so	on	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	built	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	,	and	it	will	be	on	show	in	phillips	next	year	in	new	york	.
i	have	a	big	show	with	phillips	 auction 	 e 	 ers 	 	.
when	i	see	these	 anim 	 ations 	 	,	oh	jesus	,	i	'm	blown	away	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	my	studio	 every 	 day 	 	.	i	walk	--	i	'm	 travel 	 ing 	 	.	i	come	back	.
some	guy	's	got	that	on	a	computer	--	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	like	,	oh	my	 good 	 ness 	 	.
so	i	try	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	energy	of	 invent 	 ion 	 	every	day	in	my	studio	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 effe 	 rv 	 escent 	 	,	fully	charged	sense	of	soup	that	 deliver 	 s 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
single	-	surface	 product 	 s 	 	.	furniture	's	a	good	one	.
how	you	grow	 leg 	 s 	 	out	of	a	surface	.
i	would	love	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	one	day	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	i	'd	like	to	build	it	 al 	 so 	 	out	of	flour	,	sugar	,	polymer	,	wood	 chip 	 s 	 	--	i	do	n't	know	,	human	hair	.	i	do	n't	know	.	i	'd	love	a	go	at	that	.
i	do	n't	know	.	if	i	just	got	some	time	.
that	's	the	weird	side	coming	out	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	a	lot	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	do	n't	understand	that	.
three	 week 	 s 	 	ago	i	was	with	sony	in	tokyo	.	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	give	us	the	dream	.
what	is	our	dream	?	how	do	we	beat	apple	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	you	do	n't	copy	apple	,	that	's	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	 bio 	 polymer 	 s 	 	.	``	they	 look 	 ed 	 	straight	through	me	.
what	a	waste	.	 any 	 way 	 	.
no	,	it	's	true	.	fuck	'	em	.	fuck	'	em	.	you	know	,	i	mean	.
i	'm	 deliver 	 ing 	 	;	they	're	not	taking	.	i	've	had	 th 	 is 	 	image	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	've	had	 th 	 is 	 	image	of	a	water	 drop 	 let 	 	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	hot	bed	.
that	is	an	image	of	a	car	for	me	.
that	's	the	car	of	the	future	.	it	's	a	water	 drop 	 let 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	about	 th 	 is 	 	like	i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	.
 car 	 s 	 	are	all	wrong	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	a	bit	weird	now	.
they	 laugh 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	over	the	world	i	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	that	did	n't	laugh	was	moscow	.
 it 	 s 	 	 car 	 s 	 	are	made	from	30,000	 component 	 s 	 	.
how	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	is	that	?	could	n't	you	make	that	from	300	?
it	's	got	a	vacuum	-	 form 	 ed 	 	,	carbon	-	nylon	pan	.	 every 	 thing 	 	's	 hol 	 istically 	 	 integrate 	 d 	 	.
it	 open 	 s 	 	and	 close 	 s 	 	like	a	bread	bin	.
there	is	no	engine	.	there	's	a	solar	 pan 	 el 	 	on	the	back	,	and	there	are	 batt 	 eries 	 	in	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	.
they	're	fitted	like	formula	one	.	you	take	them	off	your	wall	.
you	plug	them	in	.	off	you	 jol 	 ly 	 	well	go	.
a	three	-	 wheel 	 ed 	 	car	:	 s 	 low 	 	,	 femin 	 ine 	 	,	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	so	you	can	see	the	people	in	there	.	you	drive	different	.
you	see	that	thing	.	you	do	.
you	do	and	not	 anaesthet 	 ized 	 	,	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	life	.
there	's	a	hole	at	the	front	,	and	there	's	a	reason	for	that	.
it	's	a	city	car	.	you	drive	 a 	 long 	 	.	you	get	out	.
you	drive	on	to	a	 prob 	 os 	 cis 	 	.	you	get	out	.	it	 lift 	 s 	 	you	up	.
it	 present 	 s 	 	the	solar	 pan 	 el 	 	to	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	and	at	night	it	's	a	street	lamp	.
that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	get	inspired	by	the	street	lamp	first	,	and	then	do	the	car	second	.	these	 bubble 	 s 	 	--	i	can	see	these	 bubble 	 s 	 	with	these	hydrogen	 package 	 s 	 	,	 float 	 ing 	 	around	on	the	ground	driven	by	ai	.
when	i	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	south	africa	,	 every 	 body 	 	after	was	going	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 he 	 y 	 	,	car	on	a	stick	.	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
can	you	imagine	?	a	car	on	a	stick	.
if	you	put	it	next	to	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	natural	to	me	.
and	that	's	what	i	do	with	my	furniture	.
i	'm	not	 put 	 ting 	 	charles	eames	'	furniture	in	 building 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
forget	that	.	we	move	on	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	furniture	that	 fit 	 s 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	 transport 	 ation 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
i	work	on	 air 	 craft 	 	for	airbus	,	the	whole	thing	--	i	do	all	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	stuff	 try 	 ing 	 	to	force	these	natural	,	inspired	-	by	-	nature	 dream 	 s 	 	home	.	i	'm	going	to	finish	on	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ster 	 io 	 lith 	 ography 	 	of	a	 stair 	 case 	 	.
it	's	a	little	bit	of	a	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	to	james	,	james	watson	.
i	built	 th 	 is 	 	thing	for	my	studio	.
it	cost	me	250,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	.
most	people	go	and	buy	the	aston	martin	.	i	built	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	data	that	 go 	 es 	 	with	that	.	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	complex	.
took	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	looking	for	fat	-	free	design	.
lean	,	efficient	 thing 	 s 	 	.	 health 	 y 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	built	by	 composite 	 s 	 	.	it	's	a	single	element	which	 rot 	 ates 	 	around	to	create	a	 hol 	 istic 	 	element	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	carbon	-	fiber	 hand 	 rail 	 	which	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	in	two	 place 	 s 	 	.
modern	 material 	 s 	 	allow	us	to	do	modern	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	shot	in	the	studio	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	every	day	.
you	would	n't	want	to	have	a	fear	of	 height 	 s 	 	coming	down	it	.
there	is	 virtual 	 ly 	 	no	 hand 	 rail 	 	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	pass	any	 standard 	 s 	 	.
who	 care 	 s 	 	?
 yea 	 h 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	internal	 hand 	 rail 	 	which	 give 	 s 	 	it	it	's	strength	.	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 hol 	 istic 	 	 integ 	 ration 	 	.
that	's	my	studio	.	it	's	 sub 	 terranean 	 	.
it	's	in	notting	hill	next	to	all	the	crap	--	you	know	,	the	 prostitute 	 s 	 	and	all	that	stuff	.
it	's	next	to	david	hockney	's	original	studio	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 light 	 ing 	 	system	that	 change 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	day	.
my	 guy 	 s 	 	go	out	for	lunch	.	the	door	's	open	.	they	come	back	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 normal 	 ly 	 	 rain 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	prefer	to	stay	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	studio	.	elephant	skull	from	oxford	university	,	1988	.
i	 b 	 ought 	 	that	last	year	.	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	find	.
i	would	--	if	 any 	 body 	 	's	got	a	whale	skeleton	they	want	to	sell	me	,	i	'll	put	it	in	the	studio	.
so	i	'm	just	going	to	 inter 	 ject 	 	a	little	bit	with	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	'll	see	in	the	video	.
it	's	a	 home 	 made 	 	video	,	made	it	 my 	 self 	 	at	three	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	just	to	show	you	how	my	real	world	is	.	you	never	see	that	.
you	never	see	 architect 	 s 	 	or	 design 	 ers 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	you	 the 	 ir 	 	real	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	plasnet	.	``
it	's	a	bio	-	polycarbonate	new	chair	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	in	italy	.
world	's	first	bamboo	bike	with	 fold 	 ing 	 	 handle 	 bar 	 s 	 	.
we	should	all	be	 rid 	 ing 	 	one	of	these	.
 a 	 s 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	 buy 	 s 	 	all	these	 crap 	 py 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	we	should	be	 rid 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 counter 	 balance 	 	.
like	i	say	,	it	's	a	cross	between	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	museum	and	a	nasa	 labor 	 atory 	 	.	it	's	full	of	 prototype 	 s 	 	and	 object 	 s 	 	.
it	's	self	-	 inspiration 	 al 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.	i	mean	,	the	rare	 time 	 s 	 	when	i	'm	there	,	i	do	enjoy	it	.	and	i	get	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 kid 	 s 	 	coming	--	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 kid 	 s 	 	coming	.
i	'm	a	 contami 	 nator 	 	for	all	 t 	 hose 	 	children	of	 invest 	 ment 	 	 bank 	 ers 	 	--	 wan 	 ker 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	--	sorry	--	--	that	's	a	solar	seed	.	it	's	a	 con 	 cept 	 	for	new	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
that	thing	on	the	top	is	the	world	's	first	solar	-	powered	garden	lamp	--	the	first	 produce 	 d 	 	.	giles	revell	should	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	--	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 photograph 	 y 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	see	.
the	first	 sculpt 	 ural 	 	model	i	made	for	that	thing	in	tokyo	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.	there	's	a	little	leaf	chair	--	that	 gold 	 en 	 	looking	thing	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	leaf	.	``
it	's	made	from	kevlar	.
on	the	wall	is	my	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 super 	 natural 	 	,	``	which	 allow 	 s 	 	me	to	remember	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	forget	.
there	's	an	 a 	 er 	 ated 	 	brick	i	did	in	limoges	last	year	,	in	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	for	new	 ceramic 	 s 	 	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	 work 	 ing 	 	at	three	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	and	i	do	n't	pay	 over 	 time 	 	.
 over 	 time 	 	is	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	of	design	,	so	join	the	club	or	do	n't	.
no	,	it	's	true	.	it	's	true	.	people	like	tom	and	greg	--	we	're	 travel 	 ing 	 	like	you	ca	n't	--	we	fit	it	all	in	.	i	do	n't	know	how	we	do	it	.
next	week	i	'm	at	electrolux	in	sweden	,	then	i	'm	in	beijing	on	friday	.	you	work	that	one	out	.
and	when	i	see	ed	's	 photograph 	 s 	 	i	think	,	why	the	hell	am	i	going	to	 chin 	 a 	 	?	it	's	true	.
it	's	true	.	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	soul	in	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	.
we	need	to	have	a	new	instinct	for	the	21st	century	.
we	need	to	combine	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
if	all	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	over	 th 	 is 	 	period	 work 	 ed 	 	on	a	car	together	,	it	would	be	a	joy	,	absolute	joy	.
so	there	's	a	new	x	-	light	system	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	in	japan	.
there	's	tuareg	 shoe 	 s 	 	from	north	africa	.	there	's	a	kifwebe	mask	.
these	are	my	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	.
a	 cop 	 per 	 	jelly	mold	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	some	quiz	show	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	?
so	,	it	's	going	to	end	.
thank	you	,	james	,	for	your	great	inspiration	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
