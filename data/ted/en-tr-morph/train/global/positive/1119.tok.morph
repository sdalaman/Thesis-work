how	often	do	we	hear	that	people	just	do	n't	care	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	have	you	 be 	 en 	 	told	that	real	,	 sub 	 stantial 	 	change	is	n't	possible	 be 	 cause 	 	most	people	are	too	 self 	 ish 	 	,	too	stupid	or	too	 laz 	 y 	 	to	try	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	community	?
i	 pro 	 pose 	 	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	that	 a 	 pathy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	think	we	know	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	exist	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	that	people	do	care	,	but	that	we	live	in	a	world	that	 active 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 courage 	 s 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	by	 constant 	 ly 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	 obstacle 	 s 	 	and	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	in	our	way	.
and	i	'll	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	what	i	mean	.
let	's	start	with	city	hall	.
you	ever	see	one	of	these	before	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 news 	 paper 	 	ad	.
it	's	a	notice	of	a	 zon 	 ing 	 	application	change	for	a	new	 off 	 ice 	 	building	so	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	 know 	 s 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	to	read	.
you	need	to	get	 half 	 way 	 	down	to	even	find	out	which	address	they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	and	then	 far 	 ther 	 	down	,	in	 tin 	 y 	 	10	-	point	font	,	to	find	out	how	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 involve 	 d 	 	.
imagine	if	the	private	sector	 advertise 	 d 	 	in	the	same	way	--	if	nike	 want 	 ed 	 	to	sell	a	pair	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	put	an	ad	in	the	paper	like	that	.
now	that	would	never	happen	.
you	'll	never	see	an	ad	like	that	 be 	 cause 	 	nike	 actual 	 ly 	 	 want 	 s 	 	you	to	buy	 the 	 ir 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	city	of	toronto	 clear 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	you	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	 plan 	 ning 	 	process	,	 other 	 wise 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	would	look	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	with	all	the	information	 bas 	 ically 	 	laid	out	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	the	city	's	 put 	 ting 	 	out	 notice 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	to	try	to	get	people	 engag 	 ed 	 	,	then	of	course	people	are	n't	going	to	be	 engag 	 ed 	 	.
but	that	's	not	 a 	 pathy 	 	;	that	's	intentional	 ex 	 clusion 	 	.
public	space	.
the	manner	in	which	we	 mis 	 treat 	 	our	public	 space 	 s 	 	is	a	huge	obstacle	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	any	type	of	 progress 	 ive 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	change	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 essential 	 ly 	 	put	a	price	tag	on	 free 	 dom 	 	of	 express 	 ion 	 	.
 who 	 ever 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	most	money	 get 	 s 	 	the	 loud 	 est 	 	voice	,	 domin 	 ating 	 	the	visual	and	mental	environment	.
the	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	model	is	that	there	are	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	that	need	to	be	 s 	 aid 	 	that	are	n't	 profit 	 able 	 	to	say	.
so	you	're	never	going	to	see	them	on	a	 bill 	 board 	 	.
the	media	 play 	 s 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	role	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	our	relationship	with	 politic 	 al 	 	change	,	 main 	 ly 	 	by	 ignor 	 ing 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	and	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	 celebr 	 ities 	 	and	 scandal 	 s 	 	,	but	even	when	they	do	talk	about	 import 	 ant 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	they	do	it	in	a	way	that	i	feel	 dis 	 courage 	 s 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
and	i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	the	now	magazine	from	last	week	--	 progress 	 ive 	 	,	 down 	 town 	 	 week 	 ly 	 	in	toronto	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	cover	story	.
it	's	an	article	about	a	theater	performance	,	and	it	 start 	 s 	 	with	 bas 	 ic 	 	information	about	where	it	is	,	in	case	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	to	go	and	see	it	after	you	've	read	the	article	--	where	,	the	time	,	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
same	with	 th 	 is 	 	--	it	's	a	movie	review	,	an	art	review	,	a	book	review	--	where	the	 read 	 ing 	 	is	in	case	you	want	to	go	.
a	restaurant	--	you	might	not	want	to	just	read	about	it	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	want	to	go	to	the	restaurant	.
so	they	tell	you	where	it	is	,	what	the	 price 	 s 	 	are	,	the	address	,	the	phone	number	,	etc	.
then	you	get	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 article 	 s 	 	.
here	's	a	great	article	about	an	 import 	 ant 	 	election	race	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
it	 talk 	 s 	 	about	the	 candid 	 ates 	 	--	written	 ver 	 y 	 	well	--	but	no	information	,	no	follow	-	up	,	no	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	for	the	 campaign 	 s 	 	,	no	information	about	when	the	 debate 	 s 	 	are	,	where	the	campaign	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	are	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	good	article	about	a	new	campaign	 oppos 	 ing 	 	 privat 	 ization 	 	of	transit	 with 	 out 	 	any	contact	information	for	the	campaign	.
the	 mess 	 age 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	that	the	 read 	 ers 	 	are	most	 like 	 ly 	 	to	want	to	eat	,	 may 	 be 	 	read	a	book	,	 may 	 be 	 	see	a	movie	,	but	not	be	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	community	.
and	you	might	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	small	thing	,	but	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 set 	 s 	 	a	tone	and	it	 reinforce 	 s 	 	the	 danger 	 ous 	 	idea	that	 politic 	 s 	 	is	a	 spect 	 ator 	 	 s 	 port 	 	.
heroes	:	how	do	we	view	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	?
look	at	these	10	 movie 	 s 	 	.	what	do	they	have	in	common	?
 any 	 one 	 	?
they	all	have	heroes	who	 we 	 re 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	came	up	to	them	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	're	the	 chose 	 n 	 	one	.
there	's	a	 prop 	 he 	 s 	 y 	 	.	you	have	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.	``
and	then	 some 	 one 	 	 go 	 es 	 	off	and	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	the	world	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	told	to	,	with	a	few	people	 tag 	 ging 	 	 a 	 long 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 help 	 s 	 	me	understand	why	a	lot	of	people	have	trouble	 see 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	all	the	wrong	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	about	what	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	is	about	.
a	 hero 	 ic 	 	effort	is	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	effort	,	number	one	.
number	two	,	it	's	 im 	 perfect 	 	;	it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 sudden 	 ly 	 	start	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	end	.
it	's	an	 on 	 going 	 	process	your	whole	life	.
but	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	voluntary	.
it	's	voluntary	.
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 teach 	 ing 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	that	 hero 	 ism 	 	 start 	 s 	 	when	 some 	 one 	 	 scratch 	 es 	 	a	mark	on	your	 fore 	 head 	 	,	or	 some 	 one 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	you	're	part	of	a	 prop 	 he 	 cy 	 	,	they	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	which	is	that	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	 with 	 in 	 	.
it	's	about	 follow 	 ing 	 	your	own	 dream 	 s 	 	--	 un 	 invit 	 ed 	 	,	 un 	 invit 	 ed 	 	--	and	then	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 other 	 s 	 	to	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	come	true	.
 politic 	 al 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	:	oh	boy	.
 politic 	 al 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	could	and	should	be	one	of	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	entry	 point 	 s 	 	for	people	to	get	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	 politic 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	they	've	 be 	 come 	 	,	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	 un 	 inspiring 	 	and	 un 	 creative 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ly 	 	so	 heav 	 ily 	 	on	market	research	and	 poll 	 ing 	 	and	focus	 group 	 s 	 	that	they	end	up	all	 say 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 regurgit 	 ating 	 	back	to	us	what	we	 al 	 ready 	 	want	to	hear	at	the	expense	of	 put 	 ting 	 	forward	bold	and	creative	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	people	can	smell	that	,	and	it	 feed 	 s 	 	 cynic 	 ism 	 	.
 char 	 it 	 able 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	:	 group 	 s 	 	who	have	 char 	 it 	 able 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	in	canada	are	n't	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	do	 advoc 	 acy 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	huge	problem	and	a	huge	obstacle	to	change	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	some	of	the	most	passionate	and	 inform 	 ed 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 silence 	 d 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	election	time	.
which	 lead 	 s 	 	us	to	the	last	one	,	which	is	our	 election 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	may	have	 notice 	 d 	 	,	our	 election 	 s 	 	in	canada	are	a	complete	joke	.
we	use	out	-	of	-	date	 system 	 s 	 	that	are	 un 	 fair 	 	and	create	random	 result 	 s 	 	.
canada	's	 current 	 ly 	 	led	by	a	party	that	most	canadians	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	.
how	can	we	 honest 	 ly 	 	and	 genuine 	 ly 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	more	people	to	vote	when	 vote 	 s 	 	do	n't	count	in	canada	?
you	add	all	 th 	 is 	 	up	together	and	of	course	people	are	 a 	 pathetic 	 	.
it	's	like	 try 	 ing 	 	to	run	 in 	 to 	 	a	brick	wall	.
now	i	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	negative	by	 throw 	 ing 	 	all	these	 obstacle 	 s 	 	out	and	 explain 	 ing 	 	what	's	in	our	way	.
 quit 	 e 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	:	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	people	are	 amaz 	 ing 	 	and	smart	and	that	they	do	care	.
but	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	live	in	 th 	 is 	 	environment	where	all	these	 obstacle 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	put	in	our	way	.
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	people	,	our	own	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	are	 self 	 ish 	 	,	stupid	or	 laz 	 y 	 	,	then	there	's	no	hope	.
but	we	can	change	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	.
we	can	open	up	city	hall	.
we	can	reform	our	 elect 	 or 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
we	can	 democrat 	 ize 	 	our	public	 space 	 s 	 	.
my	main	 mess 	 age 	 	is	,	if	we	can	 re 	 define 	 	 a 	 pathy 	 	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	some	kind	of	internal	syndrome	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	complex	web	of	cultural	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	that	 reinforce 	 s 	 	 dis 	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	and	if	we	can	 clear 	 ly 	 	define	,	we	can	 clear 	 ly 	 	identify	,	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 obstacle 	 s 	 	are	,	and	then	if	we	can	work	together	 collect 	 ively 	 	to	dismantle	 t 	 hose 	 	 obstacle 	 s 	 	,	then	 any 	 thing 	 	is	possible	.
thank	you	.
