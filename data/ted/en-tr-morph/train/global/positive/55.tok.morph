i	ca	n't	help	but	with	 th 	 is 	 	wish	to	think	about	when	you	're	a	little	kid	and	you	--	all	your	 friend 	 s 	 	ask	you	if	a	 gen 	 ie 	 	could	give	you	one	wish	in	the	world	,	what	would	it	be	?
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 answer 	 ed 	 	,	``	well	,	i	'd	want	the	wish	to	have	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	to	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	to	wish	for	.	``
well	,	then	you	'd	be	 screw 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	'd	know	what	to	wish	for	and	you	'd	used	up	your	wish	.
and	now	,	since	we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	one	wish	--	 un 	 like 	 	last	year	they	had	three	 wish 	 es 	 	--	i	'm	not	going	to	wish	for	that	.
so	let	's	get	to	what	i	would	like	,	which	is	world	peace	.
and	i	know	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	.
you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	the	poor	girl	up	there	--	she	 think 	 s 	 	she	's	at	a	 beaut 	 y 	 	 page 	 ant 	 	.
she	's	not	.	she	's	at	the	ted	prize	.
but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	think	it	 make 	 s 	 	sense	,	and	i	think	that	the	first	step	to	world	peace	is	for	people	to	meet	each	other	.
i	've	met	a	lot	of	different	people	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	and	i	've	 film 	 ed 	 	some	of	them	--	from	a	 dot 	 com 	 	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	in	new	york	that	 want 	 ed 	 	to	take	over	the	world	to	a	 militar 	 y 	 	press	officer	in	qatar	that	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	not	take	over	the	world	.
if	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	film	``	control	room	``	that	was	 s 	 ent 	 	out	,	you	'd	understand	a	little	bit	why	.	thank	you	.
 w 	 ow 	 	!	some	of	you	 watch 	 ed 	 	it	.
that	's	great	.	that	's	great	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	way	for	people	to	travel	,	to	meet	people	in	a	different	way	than	--	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	travel	all	over	the	world	at	the	same	time	.
and	a	long	time	ago	--	well	,	about	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	my	mom	had	an	 ex 	 change 	 	student	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	 slide 	 s 	 	of	the	 ex 	 change 	 	student	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	donna	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	donna	at	the	statue	of	 liber 	 ty 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	mother	and	aunt	 teach 	 ing 	 	donna	how	to	ride	a	bike	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	donna	eating	ice	cream	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	donna	 teach 	 ing 	 	my	aunt	how	to	do	a	filipino	dance	.
now	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	 a 	 s 	 	the	world	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 small 	 er 	 	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	learn	each	other	's	dance	 move 	 s 	 	,	that	we	meet	each	other	,	we	get	to	know	each	other	,	we	are	able	to	figure	out	a	way	to	cross	 border 	 s 	 	,	to	understand	each	other	,	to	understand	people	's	 hope 	 s 	 	and	 dream 	 s 	 	,	what	 make 	 s 	 	them	laugh	and	cry	.
and	i	know	that	we	ca	n't	all	do	 ex 	 change 	 	 program 	 s 	 	,	and	i	ca	n't	force	 every 	 body 	 	to	travel	.
i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	that	to	chris	and	amy	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	that	there	's	a	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	ca	n't	force	people	of	free	will	,	and	i	 total 	 ly 	 	support	that	.
so	we	're	not	forcing	people	to	travel	.
but	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	 an 	 other 	 	way	to	travel	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 requir 	 e 	 	a	ship	or	an	 air 	 plane 	 	,	and	just	 requir 	 es 	 	a	movie	camera	,	a	 project 	 or 	 	and	a	screen	.
and	that	's	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	that	i	speak	a	little	bit	about	where	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	come	from	,	and	cameron	,	i	do	n't	know	how	you	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	out	of	that	one	,	but	i	think	that	building	 bridge 	 s 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	 be 	 cause 	 	of	where	i	come	from	.
i	'm	the	daughter	of	an	american	mother	and	an	egyptian	-	lebanese	-	syrian	father	.
so	i	'm	the	living	product	of	two	 culture 	 s 	 	coming	together	.
no	pun	 intend 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	've	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	an	egyptian	-	lebanese	-	syrian	american	with	a	persian	name	--	the	``	middle	east	peace	crisis	.	``
so	 may 	 be 	 	me	 start 	 ing 	 	to	take	 picture 	 s 	 	was	some	kind	of	way	to	 br 	 ing 	 	both	 side 	 s 	 	of	my	family	together	,	a	way	to	take	the	 world 	 s 	 	with	me	,	a	way	to	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	 visual 	 ly 	 	.
it	all	kind	of	 start 	 ed 	 	that	way	,	but	i	think	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	the	power	of	the	image	when	i	first	went	to	the	garbage	-	 collect 	 ing 	 	village	in	egypt	,	when	i	was	about	16.	my	mother	took	me	there	.
she	's	 some 	 body 	 	that	 believ 	 es 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	in	community	service	and	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	and	so	i	went	there	and	i	met	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	women	there	.
there	was	a	center	there	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	people	how	to	read	and	write	and	get	 vaccin 	 ations 	 	against	the	 man 	 y 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	you	can	get	from	 sort 	 ing 	 	through	garbage	.
and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	start	 teach 	 ing 	 	there	.
i	taught	english	,	and	i	met	some	 in 	 credible 	 	women	there	.
i	met	people	that	live	seven	people	to	a	room	,	 bare 	 ly 	 	can	afford	 the 	 ir 	 	 even 	 ing 	 	meal	,	yet	live	with	 th 	 is 	 	strength	of	spirit	and	sense	of	humor	and	just	 in 	 credible 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	.
i	got	drawn	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	community	and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	take	 picture 	 s 	 	there	.
i	took	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 old 	 er 	 	family	 member 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	 want 	 ed 	 	 memor 	 ies 	 	of	.
about	two	 year 	 s 	 	after	i	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	these	 picture 	 s 	 	,	the	un	 con 	 ference 	 	on	population	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	show	them	at	the	 con 	 ference 	 	.
so	i	was	18	;	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	my	first	exhibit	of	 photograph 	 s 	 	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	put	up	there	,	and	after	about	two	 day 	 s 	 	,	they	all	came	down	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	three	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	that	i	was	 show 	 ing 	 	these	 dirt 	 y 	 	 side 	 s 	 	of	cairo	,	and	why	did	n't	i	cut	the	dead	 don 	 key 	 	out	of	the	frame	?
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 at 	 	there	,	i	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	big	empty	wall	with	three	 lone 	 ly 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	,	you	know	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	and	i	was	like	,	i	 fail 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	i	was	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	emotion	and	 intens 	 e 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	had	come	out	of	people	just	 see 	 ing 	 	these	 photograph 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	here	i	was	,	 th 	 is 	 	18	-	year	-	old	 pip 	 squeak 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	i	put	these	 photograph 	 s 	 	on	the	wall	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 argument 	 s 	 	,	and	they	had	to	be	taken	down	.
and	i	just	saw	the	power	of	the	image	.
and	it	was	 in 	 credible 	 	.
and	i	think	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 re 	 action 	 	that	i	saw	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	people	that	would	never	have	gone	to	the	garbage	village	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	that	would	never	have	 s 	 een 	 	that	the	human	spirit	could	 thriv 	 e 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	difficult	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	it	was	at	that	point	that	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	use	 photograph 	 y 	 	and	film	to	 some 	 how 	 	bridge	 gap 	 s 	 	,	to	bridge	 culture 	 s 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 	people	together	,	cross	 border 	 s 	 	.
and	so	that	's	what	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 start 	 ed 	 	me	off	.
did	a	 s 	 tin 	 t 	 	at	mtv	,	made	a	film	 call 	 ed 	 	``	startup.com	,	``	and	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	couple	of	music	 film 	 s 	 	--	but	in	2003	,	when	the	war	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	was	about	to	start	,	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	surreal	 feel 	 ing 	 	for	me	 be 	 cause 	 	before	the	war	 start 	 ed 	 	,	there	was	kind	of	 th 	 is 	 	media	war	that	was	going	on	.
and	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	in	new	york	and	there	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	just	one	point	of	view	that	was	coming	 a 	 cross 	 	,	and	the	 cover 	 age 	 	went	from	the	u.s.	state	 depart 	 ment 	 	to	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 troop 	 s 	 	and	what	was	coming	 a 	 cross 	 	on	the	news	was	that	there	was	going	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	clean	war	and	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	 bomb 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	the	iraqis	would	be	 greet 	 ing 	 	the	americans	 a 	 s 	 	 liber 	 ators 	 	and	 throw 	 ing 	 	 flower 	 s 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	feet	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	baghdad	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	there	was	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	other	story	that	was	taking	place	in	the	middle	east	where	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	that	there	was	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	other	story	 be 	 ing 	 	told	,	and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	how	are	people	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	communicate	with	each	other	when	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	and	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	what	the	other	's	 be 	 ing 	 	told	?
how	are	people	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	have	any	kind	of	common	 understand 	 ing 	 	or	know	how	to	move	together	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	?
so	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	had	to	go	there	.
i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	the	center	.
i	had	no	plan	.	i	had	no	 fund 	 ing 	 	.
i	did	n't	even	have	a	camera	at	the	time	.
i	had	 some 	 body 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	it	there	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	access	to	al	jazeera	,	george	bush	's	 favor 	 ite 	 	channel	and	a	place	which	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 dis 	 like 	 d 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	 government 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	arab	world	and	 al 	 so 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 mouth 	 piece 	 	of	osama	bin	laden	by	some	people	in	the	u.s.	government	.
so	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	station	that	's	 hat 	 ed 	 	by	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	right	.
i	've	got	to	go	see	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	about	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	see	central	command	,	which	was	10	 minute 	 s 	 	away	,	and	that	way	i	could	get	access	to	how	 th 	 is 	 	news	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 create 	 d 	 	on	the	arab	side	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	arab	world	,	and	on	the	u.s.	and	western	side	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	u.s	.
and	when	i	went	there	and	 s 	 at 	 	there	,	and	met	these	people	that	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	center	of	it	and	 s 	 at 	 	with	these	 character 	 s 	 	,	i	met	some	surprising	,	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	people	.
and	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	a	little	bit	of	that	experience	of	when	you	 s 	 it 	 	with	 some 	 body 	 	and	you	film	them	,	and	you	listen	to	them	,	and	you	allow	them	more	than	a	five	-	second	sound	bite	,	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	people	emerge	.
sameer	khader	:	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.
 ir 	 aq 	 	,	and	then	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	and	then	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
but	between	us	,	if	i	'm	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	job	with	fox	,	i	'll	take	it	.
to	change	the	arab	nightmare	 in 	 to 	 	the	american	dream	.
i	still	have	that	dream	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	will	never	be	able	to	do	it	.
but	i	have	 plan 	 s 	 	for	my	children	.
when	they	finish	 the 	 ir 	 	high	school	i	will	 s 	 end 	 	them	to	america	to	 stud 	 y 	 	there	.
i	will	pay	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	.
and	they	will	stay	there	.
josh	 rush 	 ing 	 	:	the	night	they	 show 	 ed 	 	the	pows	and	the	dead	 soldier 	 s 	 	--	al	jazeera	 show 	 ed 	 	them	--	it	was	 power 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	america	 do 	 es 	 	n't	show	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	.
most	of	the	news	in	america	wo	n't	show	 re 	 ally 	 	gory	 image 	 s 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	american	 soldier 	 s 	 	in	uniform	strewn	about	a	floor	,	a	cold	tile	floor	.
and	it	was	 revolt 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 revolt 	 ing 	 	.
it	made	me	sick	to	my	stomach	.
and	then	what	hit	me	was	,	the	night	before	,	there	had	 be 	 en 	 	some	kind	of	 bomb 	 ing 	 	in	basra	,	and	al	jazeera	had	 show 	 n 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	people	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	if	not	more	 horr 	 ifying 	 	--	the	 image 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
and	i	remember	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 een 	 	it	in	the	al	jazeera	 off 	 ice 	 	and	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	gross	.
that	's	bad	.	``
and	then	going	away	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	eating	 d 	 inner 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	it	did	n't	affect	me	 a 	 s 	 	much	.
so	--	the	impact	it	had	on	me	,	me	 real 	 izing 	 	that	i	just	saw	people	on	the	other	side	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	in	the	al	jazeera	 off 	 ice 	 	must	have	felt	the	way	i	was	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	night	.
and	it	 up 	 set 	 	me	on	a	 pro 	 found 	 	level	that	i	was	n't	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	the	night	before	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	me	hate	war	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	me	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	're	in	world	that	can	live	 with 	 out 	 	war	yet	.
jehane	noujaim	:	i	was	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	the	 respons 	 e 	 	of	the	film	,	for	we	did	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	it	would	be	able	to	get	out	there	.
we	had	no	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	it	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	that	it	got	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	,	and	when	we	 show 	 ed 	 	the	film	in	both	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	arab	world	we	had	 s 	 uch 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 react 	 ions 	 	.
it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	see	how	people	 we 	 re 	 	 move 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	film	.
in	the	arab	world	--	and	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	by	the	film	;	it	's	by	the	 character 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	josh	 rush 	 ing 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	complex	person	who	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	when	i	 show 	 ed 	 	the	film	in	the	middle	east	,	people	 want 	 ed 	 	to	meet	josh	.
he	kind	of	 re 	 defined 	 	us	 a 	 s 	 	an	american	population	.
people	 start 	 ed 	 	to	,	you	know	,	ask	me	,	where	is	 th 	 is 	 	guy	now	?
al	jazeera	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	him	a	job	.
and	sameer	,	on	the	other	hand	,	was	 al 	 so 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	character	for	the	arab	world	to	see	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 br 	 ought 	 	out	the	 complex 	 ities 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	love	/	hate	relationship	that	the	arab	world	 ha 	 s 	 	with	the	west	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	i	was	blown	away	by	the	 motiv 	 ations 	 	,	the	positive	 motiv 	 ations 	 	of	the	american	people	when	they	'd	see	 th 	 is 	 	film	.
you	know	,	we	're	 critic 	 ized 	 	 a 	 broad 	 	for	 believ 	 ing 	 	we	're	the	 savior 	 s 	 	of	the	world	in	some	way	,	but	the	flip	side	of	it	is	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	when	people	do	see	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 a 	 broad 	 	and	people	's	 react 	 ions 	 	to	some	of	our	policy	 a 	 broad 	 	,	we	feel	 th 	 is 	 	power	that	we	need	to	--	we	feel	like	we	have	to	get	the	power	to	change	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	with	 audience 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	woman	came	up	to	me	after	the	 screen 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	is	crazy	.	i	saw	the	 bomb 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 load 	 ed 	 	on	the	 plane 	 s 	 	;	i	saw	the	 militar 	 y 	 	going	out	to	war	.

how	do	we	understand	what	the	other	person	is	 think 	 ing 	 	?	``
now	,	i	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	a	film	can	change	the	world	,	but	i	know	that	it	 start 	 s 	 	--	i	know	the	power	of	it	--	i	know	that	it	 start 	 s 	 	people	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	to	change	the	world	.
now	,	i	'm	not	a	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	so	i	feel	like	i	should	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	great	depth	on	 th 	 is 	 	but	let	film	speak	for	 it 	 self 	 	and	take	you	to	 th 	 is 	 	other	world	.

if	you	kill	,	there	's	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	victim	and	occupier	.
man	:	if	we	had	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	,	we	would	n't	need	 martyr 	 s 	 	,	that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
woman	:	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	that	the	israeli	 militar 	 y 	 	is	still	 strong 	 er 	 	.
man	:	then	let	us	be	equal	in	death	.
we	still	have	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	.

when	we	got	to	here	,	we	saw	three	israeli	 militar 	 y 	 	 jeep 	 s 	 	 park 	 ed 	 	on	the	side	of	the	road	.
when	we	 pass 	 ed 	 	by	the	first	jeep	,	they	 open 	 ed 	 	fire	on	us	.
and	my	12	-	year	-	old	daughter	christine	was	 kill 	 ed 	 	in	the	 shoot 	 ing 	 	.

tzvika	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	have	 assist 	 ants 	 	.
i	deal	with	children	all	the	time	.
george	:	at	first	,	i	thought	it	was	a	strange	idea	.
but	after	 think 	 ing 	 	logically	about	it	,	i	did	n't	find	any	reason	why	not	to	meet	them	and	let	them	know	of	our	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
george	:	there	 we 	 re 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 touch 	 ed 	 	me	.
we	see	that	there	are	palestinians	who	 suffer 	 ed 	 	a	lot	,	who	lost	children	,	and	still	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	peace	process	and	in	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	.
if	we	who	lost	what	is	most	precious	can	talk	to	each	other	,	and	look	forward	to	a	better	future	,	then	 every 	 one 	 	else	must	do	so	,	too	.

you	could	give	them	a	long	 politic 	 al 	 	speech	they	would	still	not	understand	.
but	i	tell	you	,	when	you	finish	that	song	,	people	will	be	like	,	``	damn	,	i	know	where	you	 nig 	 gaz 	 	are	coming	from	.

jehane	noujaim	:	i	think	 every 	 body 	 	's	had	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	theater	,	in	a	dark	room	,	with	other	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	film	,	and	they	felt	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	is	how	can	we	use	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	a	 move 	 ment 	 	through	film	?
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 talk 	 s 	 	in	some	of	the	 con 	 ference 	 	,	and	robert	wright	 s 	 aid 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	that	if	we	have	an	 appreci 	 ation 	 	for	 an 	 other 	 	person	's	 human 	 ity 	 	,	then	they	will	have	an	 appreci 	 ation 	 	for	 our 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	.
it	's	about	 connect 	 ing 	 	people	through	film	,	 get 	 ting 	 	these	 in 	 dependent 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	out	there	.
now	josh	 rush 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	 militar 	 y 	 	and	taking	a	job	with	al	jazeera	,	so	his	 feel 	 ing 	 	is	that	he	's	on	al	jazeera	 inter 	 national 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 feel 	 s 	 	like	he	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	media	to	bridge	the	gap	between	east	and	west	.
and	that	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	.
but	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	think	about	ways	to	give	power	to	these	 in 	 dependent 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	,	to	give	power	to	the	 film 	 makers 	 	,	to	give	power	to	people	who	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	use	film	for	change	.
and	there	are	 in 	 credible 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	are	out	there	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
there	's	witness	,	that	you	heard	from	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
there	's	just	vision	,	that	are	 work 	 ing 	 	with	palestinians	and	israelis	who	are	 work 	 ing 	 	together	for	peace	,	and	 document 	 ing 	 	that	process	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 interview 	 s 	 	out	there	and	using	 th 	 is 	 	film	to	take	to	congress	to	show	that	it	's	a	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	to	show	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	woman	who	's	had	her	daughter	 kill 	 ed 	 	in	an	attack	,	and	she	 believ 	 es 	 	that	there	are	 peace 	 ful 	 	ways	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	's	 work 	 ing 	 	 film 	 s 	 	and	there	's	current	tv	,	which	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	platform	for	people	around	the	world	to	be	able	to	put	 the 	 ir 	 	--	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
i	 watch 	 ed 	 	it	and	i	'm	just	--	i	'm	blown	away	by	it	and	 it 	 s 	 	potential	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	,	and	create	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	 democrat 	 ic 	 	,	global	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
so	what	can	we	do	to	create	a	platform	for	these	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	to	create	some	 moment 	 um 	 	,	to	get	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	world	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	?
i	'd	like	for	us	to	imagine	for	a	second	--	imagine	a	day	when	you	have	 every 	 one 	 	coming	together	from	around	the	world	.
you	have	 town 	 s 	 	and	 village 	 s 	 	and	 theater 	 s 	 	all	from	around	the	world	 get 	 ting 	 	together	,	and	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	dark	,	and	sharing	a	 commun 	 al 	 	experience	of	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	film	,	or	a	couple	of	 film 	 s 	 	,	together	.
 watch 	 ing 	 	a	film	which	 may 	 be 	 	 high 	 light 	 s 	 	a	character	that	is	 fight 	 ing 	 	to	live	,	or	just	a	character	that	 defi 	 es 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	,	 make 	 s 	 	a	joke	,	 s 	 ing 	 s 	 	a	song	.
 come 	 dies 	 	,	 document 	 aries 	 	,	 short 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	power	can	be	used	to	change	people	and	to	bond	people	together	,	to	cross	 border 	 s 	 	and	have	people	feel	like	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 commun 	 al 	 	experience	.
so	if	you	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	day	when	all	around	the	world	you	have	 theater 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	and	 place 	 s 	 	where	we	project	 film 	 s 	 	.
if	you	imagine	from	--	 project 	 ing 	 	from	 time 	 s 	 	square	to	tahir	square	in	cairo	,	the	same	film	in	ramallah	,	the	same	film	in	jerusalem	.
you	know	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	a	friend	of	mine	about	using	the	side	of	the	great	pyramid	and	the	great	wall	of	 chin 	 a 	 	.
it	's	 end 	 less 	 	what	you	can	imagine	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	where	you	can	project	 film 	 s 	 	and	where	you	can	have	 th 	 is 	 	 commun 	 al 	 	experience	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	one	day	,	if	we	can	create	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	day	can	create	 moment 	 um 	 	for	all	of	these	 in 	 dependent 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	.
is	n't	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	which	is	 connect 	 ing 	 	the	 in 	 dependent 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	of	the	world	to	get	out	there	,	and	yet	i	'm	 hear 	 ing 	 	 through 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	that	the	 big 	 gest 	 	danger	in	our	future	is	[	lack	of	]	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	other	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	mutual	respect	for	the	other	and	 cross 	 ing 	 	 border 	 s 	 	.
and	if	film	can	do	that	,	and	if	we	can	get	all	of	these	different	 location 	 s 	 	in	the	world	to	watch	these	 film 	 s 	 	together	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	an	 in 	 credible 	 	day	.
so	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	made	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	set	up	through	 some 	 body 	 	from	the	ted	community	,	john	camen	,	 introduc 	 ed 	 	me	to	steven	apkon	,	from	the	jacob	 burn 	 s 	 	film	center	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	up	 every 	 body 	 	.
and	in	the	last	week	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	that	have	 respond 	 ed 	 	to	us	from	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	palo	 al 	 to 	 	to	mongolia	and	to	india	.
there	are	people	that	want	to	be	a	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	global	day	of	film	,	to	be	able	to	provide	a	platform	for	 in 	 dependent 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 dependent 	 	 film 	 s 	 	to	get	out	there	.
now	,	we	've	thought	about	a	name	for	 th 	 is 	 	day	and	i	'd	like	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	with	you	.
now	,	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	whole	process	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	sharing	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 wish 	 es 	 	,	and	so	i	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	give	 brain 	 storm 	 s 	 	onto	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	day	echo	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	?
how	do	we	use	technology	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	day	echo	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,	so	that	we	can	build	community	and	have	these	 commun 	 ities 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	through	the	 inter 	 net 	 	?
there	was	a	time	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	all	of	the	 continent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	together	.
and	we	 call 	 ed 	 	that	 land 	 mass 	 	pangea	.
so	what	we	'd	like	to	call	 th 	 is 	 	day	of	film	is	pangea	cinema	day	.
and	if	you	just	imagine	that	all	of	these	people	in	these	 town 	 s 	 	would	be	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	then	i	think	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	make	a	 move 	 ment 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	people	 understand 	 ing 	 	each	other	better	.
i	know	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 tangible 	 	,	 touch 	 ing 	 	people	's	 heart 	 s 	 	and	 soul 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	i	know	how	to	do	it	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	i	know	how	to	reach	out	to	 some 	 body 	 	's	heart	and	soul	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	is	by	 show 	 ing 	 	them	a	film	.
and	i	know	that	there	are	 in 	 dependent 	 	 film 	 makers 	 	and	 film 	 s 	 	out	there	that	can	 re 	 ally 	 	make	 th 	 is 	 	happen	.
and	that	's	my	wish	.
so	i	guess	i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	give	you	my	one	-	sentence	wish	,	but	we	're	way	out	of	time	.
chris	anderson	:	that	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	wish	.
pangea	cinema	--	the	day	the	world	 come 	 s 	 	together	.
jn	:	it	's	more	tangible	than	world	peace	,	and	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	more	 im 	 mediate 	 	.
but	it	would	be	the	day	that	the	world	 come 	 s 	 	together	through	film	,	the	power	of	film	.
