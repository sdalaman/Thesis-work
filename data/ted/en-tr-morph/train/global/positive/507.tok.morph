what	i	'm	going	to	try	to	do	is	explain	to	you	 quick 	 ly 	 	how	to	predict	,	and	 illustr 	 ate 	 	it	with	some	 predict 	 ions 	 	about	what	iran	is	going	to	do	in	the	next	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	order	to	predict	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	to	use	science	.
and	the	reason	that	we	need	to	use	science	is	 be 	 cause 	 	then	we	can	 re 	 produce 	 	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	;	it	's	not	just	 wis 	 dom 	 	or	 guess 	 work 	 	.
and	if	we	can	predict	,	then	we	can	engineer	the	future	.
so	if	you	are	 concern 	 ed 	 	to	influence	energy	policy	,	or	you	are	 concern 	 ed 	 	to	influence	national	security	policy	,	or	health	policy	,	or	education	,	science	--	and	a	 part 	 icular 	 	branch	of	science	--	is	a	way	to	do	it	,	not	the	way	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	which	is	seat	-	of	-	the	-	pants	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
now	before	i	get	 in 	 to 	 	how	to	do	it	let	me	give	you	a	little	truth	in	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	not	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	the	business	of	magic	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	thing	that	the	approach	i	take	can	predict	,	and	there	are	some	that	it	ca	n't	.
it	can	predict	complex	 negoti 	 ations 	 	or	 situ 	 ations 	 	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	 coerc 	 ion 	 	--	that	is	in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 politic 	 s 	 	,	much	of	what	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	business	,	but	sorry	,	if	you	're	looking	to	 specul 	 ate 	 	in	the	stock	market	,	i	do	n't	predict	stock	 market 	 s 	 	--	ok	,	it	's	not	going	up	any	time	 re 	 ally 	 	soon	.
but	i	'm	not	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
i	'm	not	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	 predict 	 ing 	 	random	number	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	phone	 call 	 s 	 	from	people	who	want	to	know	what	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	 number 	 s 	 	are	going	to	win	.
i	do	n't	have	a	clue	.
i	engage	in	the	use	of	game	 theor 	 y 	 	,	game	 theor 	 y 	 	is	a	branch	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	sorry	,	that	even	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 politic 	 s 	 	,	math	 ha 	 s 	 	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	picture	.
we	can	no	 long 	 er 	 	pretend	that	we	just	 specul 	 ate 	 	about	 politic 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	 rigor 	 ous 	 	way	.
now	,	what	is	game	 theor 	 y 	 	about	?
it	 assum 	 es 	 	that	people	are	looking	out	for	what	's	good	for	them	.
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 shock 	 ing 	 	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	controversial	for	a	lot	of	people	--	that	we	are	self	-	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
in	order	to	look	out	for	what	's	best	for	them	or	what	they	think	is	best	for	them	,	people	have	 value 	 s 	 	--	they	identify	what	they	want	,	and	what	they	do	n't	want	.
and	they	have	 belief 	 s 	 	about	what	other	people	want	,	and	what	other	people	do	n't	want	,	how	much	power	other	people	have	,	how	much	 t 	 hose 	 	people	could	get	in	the	way	of	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	that	you	want	.
and	they	face	 limit 	 ations 	 	,	 constraint 	 s 	 	,	they	may	be	weak	,	they	may	be	 locate 	 d 	 	in	the	wrong	part	of	the	world	,	they	may	be	einstein	,	 s 	 tuck 	 	away	 farm 	 ing 	 	 some 	 place 	 	in	a	 r 	 ural 	 	village	in	india	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	was	the	case	for	ramanujan	for	a	long	time	,	a	great	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	but	 no 	 body 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	.
now	who	is	rational	?
a	lot	of	people	are	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	what	is	 rational 	 ity 	 	about	?
you	know	,	what	if	people	are	rational	?
mother	theresa	,	she	was	rational	.
 terrorist 	 s 	 	,	they	're	rational	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 body 	 	is	rational	.
i	think	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 exception 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	aware	of	--	two	-	year	-	olds	,	they	are	not	rational	,	they	have	 ver 	 y 	 	fickle	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	they	 s 	 witch 	 	what	they	think	all	the	time	,	and	 schizophrenic 	 s 	 	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	rational	,	but	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 body 	 	else	is	rational	.
that	is	,	they	are	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	what	they	think	is	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	best	interest	.
now	in	order	to	work	out	what	people	are	going	to	do	to	pursue	 the 	 ir 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	think	about	who	 ha 	 s 	 	influence	in	the	world	.
if	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	influence	 corporation 	 s 	 	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	,	with	regard	to	producing	 pollutant 	 s 	 	,	one	approach	,	the	common	approach	,	is	to	exhort	them	to	be	better	,	to	explain	to	them	what	damage	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	the	planet	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	have	 notice 	 d 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 a 	 s 	 	big	an	effect	,	 a 	 s 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	you	would	like	it	to	have	.
but	if	you	show	them	that	it	's	in	 the 	 ir 	 	interest	,	then	they	're	 respons 	 ive 	 	.
so	,	we	have	to	work	out	who	 influence 	 s 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
if	we	're	looking	at	iran	,	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	we	would	like	to	think	,	may	have	some	influence	--	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	 p 	 resident 	 	in	iran	 ha 	 s 	 	some	influence	--	but	we	make	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	if	we	just	pay	attention	to	the	person	at	the	top	of	the	power	 lad 	 der 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	person	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	much	about	iran	,	or	about	energy	policy	,	or	about	health	care	,	or	about	any	 part 	 icular 	 	policy	.
that	person	 surround 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	or	 her 	 self 	 	with	 advise 	 rs 	 	.
if	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	national	security	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	the	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	the	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	defense	,	the	director	of	national	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	ambassador	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	or	 some 	 body 	 	else	who	they	think	is	going	to	know	more	about	the	 part 	 icular 	 	problem	.
but	let	's	face	it	,	the	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	much	about	iran	.
the	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	defense	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	much	about	iran	.
each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	in	turn	 ha 	 s 	 	 advise 	 rs 	 	who	advise	them	,	so	they	can	advise	the	 p 	 resident 	 	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	 sha 	 ping 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	and	so	if	we	want	to	predict	 correct 	 ly 	 	we	have	to	pay	attention	to	 every 	 body 	 	who	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	shape	the	 out 	 come 	 	,	not	just	the	people	at	the	pinnacle	of	the	decision	-	making	pyramid	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	do	that	.
there	's	a	good	reason	that	we	do	n't	do	that	,	and	there	's	a	good	reason	that	using	game	 theor 	 y 	 	and	 computer 	 s 	 	,	we	can	 over 	 come 	 	the	 limit 	 ation 	 	of	just	looking	at	a	few	people	.
imagine	a	problem	with	just	five	decision	-	makers	.
imagine	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	sally	over	here	,	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	what	harry	,	and	jane	,	and	george	and	frank	are	 think 	 ing 	 	,	and	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	people	.
sally	's	giving	her	opinion	to	them	,	and	they	're	giving	 the 	 ir 	 	opinion	to	sally	.
but	sally	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	what	harry	is	 say 	 ing 	 	to	these	three	,	and	what	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	to	harry	.
and	harry	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	what	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	 say 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	,	and	so	on	,	and	sally	would	like	to	know	what	harry	 think 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	 say 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	problem	;	that	's	a	lot	to	know	.
with	five	decision	-	makers	there	are	a	lot	of	 link 	 age 	 s 	 	--	120	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	if	you	remember	your	 factor 	 ial 	 s 	 	.
five	 factor 	 ial 	 	is	120	.
now	you	may	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	know	that	smart	people	can	keep	120	 thing 	 s 	 	straight	in	 the 	 ir 	 	head	.
suppose	we	double	the	number	of	 influence 	 rs 	 	from	five	to	10	.
 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	we	've	 double 	 d 	 	the	number	of	 piece 	 s 	 	of	information	we	need	to	know	,	from	120	to	240	?
no	.	how	about	10	 time 	 s 	 	?
to	1,200	?	no	.
we	've	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	it	to	3.6	million	.
 no 	 body 	 	can	keep	that	straight	in	 the 	 ir 	 	head	.
but	 computer 	 s 	 	,	they	can	.	they	do	n't	need	coffee	 break 	 s 	 	,	they	do	n't	need	 vac 	 ations 	 	,	they	do	n't	need	to	go	to	sleep	at	night	,	they	do	n't	ask	for	 raise 	 s 	 	either	.
they	can	keep	 th 	 is 	 	information	straight	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	can	process	the	information	.
so	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	how	to	process	it	,	and	i	'm	going	to	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	out	of	iran	,	and	you	're	going	to	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	should	we	listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	guy	?
why	should	we	 believ 	 e 	 	what	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	?	``
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	 fact 	 oid 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 assess 	 ment 	 	by	the	central	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	of	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	time	that	the	model	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	right	in	 predict 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 out 	 come 	 	is	not	yet	known	,	when	the	 expert 	 s 	 	who	 provide 	 d 	 	the	data	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	got	it	wrong	.
that	's	not	my	claim	,	that	's	a	cia	claim	--	you	can	read	it	,	it	was	 de 	 class 	 ified 	 	a	while	ago	.	you	can	read	it	in	a	volume	 edit 	 ed 	 	by	h.	bradford	westerfield	,	yale	university	press	.
so	,	what	do	we	need	to	know	in	order	to	predict	?
you	may	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	find	out	we	do	n't	need	to	know	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
we	do	need	to	know	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 take 	 	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	shape	the	 out 	 come 	 	of	a	decision	.
we	need	to	know	what	they	say	they	want	,	not	what	they	want	in	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	of	 heart 	 s 	 	,	not	what	they	think	they	can	get	,	but	what	they	say	they	want	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	a	 strat 	 egic 	 ally 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	position	,	and	we	can	work	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	from	that	to	draw	 in 	 ference 	 s 	 	about	 import 	 ant 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	decision	-	making	.
we	need	to	know	how	focused	they	are	on	the	problem	at	hand	.
that	is	,	how	 will 	 ing 	 	are	they	to	drop	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	when	the	issue	 come 	 s 	 	up	,	and	attend	to	it	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	's	on	 the 	 ir 	 	plate	--	how	big	a	deal	is	it	to	them	?
and	how	much	 cl 	 out 	 	could	they	 br 	 ing 	 	to	bear	if	they	chose	to	engage	on	the	issue	?
if	we	know	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	predict	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	by	 assum 	 ing 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 care 	 s 	 	about	two	 thing 	 s 	 	on	any	decision	.
they	care	about	the	 out 	 come 	 	.	they	'd	like	an	 out 	 come 	 	 a 	 s 	 	close	to	what	they	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
they	're	 care 	 er 	 ists 	 	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	care	about	 get 	 ting 	 	credit	--	there	's	ego	 involve 	 ment 	 	,	they	want	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 sha 	 ping 	 	the	 out 	 come 	 	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	if	it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	 d 	 ruth 	 ers 	 	,	to	block	an	 out 	 come 	 	.
and	so	we	have	to	figure	out	how	they	balance	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
different	people	trade	off	between	 stand 	 ing 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 out 	 come 	 	,	 faith 	 fully 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	to	it	,	going	down	in	a	blaze	of	 glor 	 y 	 	,	or	giving	it	up	,	 put 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	finger	in	the	wind	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	they	think	is	going	to	be	a	winning	position	.
most	people	fall	in	between	,	and	if	we	can	work	out	where	they	fall	we	can	work	out	how	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	with	them	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
so	with	just	that	little	bit	of	 in 	 put 	 	we	can	work	out	what	the	 choice 	 s 	 	are	that	people	have	,	what	the	 chance 	 s 	 	are	that	they	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	,	what	they	're	after	,	what	they	value	,	what	they	want	,	and	what	they	 believ 	 e 	 	about	other	people	.
you	might	notice	what	we	do	n't	need	to	know	:	there	's	no	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	here	.
how	they	got	to	where	they	are	may	be	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 sha 	 ping 	 	the	 in 	 put 	 	information	,	but	once	we	know	where	they	are	we	're	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	where	they	're	going	to	be	headed	in	the	future	.
how	they	got	there	 turn 	 s 	 	out	not	to	be	 terr 	 ibly 	 	critical	in	 predict 	 ing 	 	.
i	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	that	90	percent	 accu 	 racy 	 	rate	.
so	where	are	we	going	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	information	?
we	can	get	 th 	 is 	 	information	from	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	from	the	economist	,	the	financial	 time 	 s 	 	,	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	u.s.	news	and	world	report	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 source 	 s 	 	like	that	,	or	we	can	get	it	from	 ask 	 ing 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	who	 s 	 pend 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 place 	 s 	 	and	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	information	.
if	they	do	n't	know	,	who	are	the	people	 try 	 ing 	 	to	influence	the	decision	,	how	much	 cl 	 out 	 	do	they	have	,	how	much	they	care	about	 th 	 is 	 	issue	,	and	what	do	they	say	they	want	,	are	they	 expert 	 s 	 	?	that	's	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	an	expert	,	that	's	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	stuff	an	expert	 need 	 s 	 	to	know	.
 al 	 right 	 	,	lets	turn	to	iran	.
let	me	make	three	 import 	 ant 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	--	you	can	check	 th 	 is 	 	out	,	time	will	tell	.
what	is	iran	going	to	do	about	 it 	 s 	 	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	program	?
how	secure	is	the	 theo 	 cratic 	 	regime	in	iran	?
what	's	 it 	 s 	 	future	?
and	 every 	 body 	 	's	best	friend	,	ahmadinejad	.	how	are	 thing 	 s 	 	going	for	him	?
how	are	 thing 	 s 	 	going	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	out	for	him	in	the	next	year	or	two	?
you	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	based	on	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	here	.	i	'm	not	 project 	 ing 	 	some	past	data	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
i	've	taken	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	on	 position 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	,	run	it	through	a	computer	model	that	had	 simul 	 ated 	 	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	and	these	are	the	 simul 	 ated 	 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	the	 predict 	 ions 	 	about	the	path	of	policy	.
so	you	can	see	here	on	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	axis	,	i	have	n't	 show 	 n 	 	it	all	the	way	down	to	zero	,	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 option 	 s 	 	,	but	here	i	'm	just	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	 predict 	 ion 	 	,	so	i	've	 narrow 	 ed 	 	the	scale	.
up	at	the	top	of	the	axis	,	``	build	the	bomb	.	``
at	130	,	we	start	 some 	 where 	 	above	130	,	between	building	a	bomb	,	and	making	 en 	 ough 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	-	grade	fuel	so	that	you	could	build	a	bomb	.
that	's	where	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	my	analyses	,	the	iranians	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	then	the	model	 make 	 s 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	down	the	road	.
at	115	they	would	 on 	 ly 	 	produce	 en 	 ough 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	grade	fuel	to	show	that	they	know	how	,	but	they	would	n't	build	a	weapon	:	they	would	build	a	research	 quant 	 ity 	 	.
it	would	 achiev 	 e 	 	some	national	 pri 	 de 	 	,	but	not	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	build	a	weapon	.
and	down	at	100	they	would	build	 civil 	 ian 	 	nuclear	energy	,	which	is	what	they	say	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 object 	 ive 	 	.
the	yellow	line	 show 	 s 	 	us	the	most	 like 	 ly 	 	path	.
the	yellow	line	 include 	 s 	 	an	analysis	of	87	decision	makers	in	iran	,	and	a	vast	number	of	 out 	 side 	 	 influence 	 rs 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	pressure	iran	 in 	 to 	 	changing	 it 	 s 	 	behavior	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	 player 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	egypt	,	and	saudi	arabia	,	and	russia	,	european	 un 	 ion 	 	,	japan	,	so	on	and	so	forth	.
the	white	line	 re 	 produce 	 s 	 	the	analysis	if	the	 inter 	 national 	 	environment	just	left	iran	to	make	 it 	 s 	 	own	internal	 decision 	 s 	 	,	under	 it 	 s 	 	own	domestic	 politic 	 al 	 	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
that	's	not	going	to	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	but	you	can	see	that	the	line	 come 	 s 	 	down	 fast 	 er 	 	if	they	're	not	put	under	 inter 	 national 	 	pressure	,	if	they	're	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	pursue	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
but	in	any	event	,	by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	next	year	,	we	get	to	a	 s 	 table 	 	equilibrium	 out 	 come 	 	.
and	that	equilibrium	is	not	what	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	would	like	,	but	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	an	equilibrium	that	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	can	live	with	,	and	that	a	lot	of	 other 	 s 	 	can	live	with	.
and	that	is	that	iran	will	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	 national 	 ist 	 	 pri 	 de 	 	by	making	 en 	 ough 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	-	grade	fuel	,	through	research	,	so	that	they	could	show	that	they	know	how	to	make	 weapon 	 s 	 	-	grade	fuel	,	but	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	build	a	bomb	.
how	is	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
over	here	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	power	in	favor	of	 civil 	 ian 	 	nuclear	energy	 to 	 day 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	that	power	block	is	 predict 	 ed 	 	to	be	like	by	the	late	 part 	 s 	 	of	2010	,	early	 part 	 s 	 	of	2011	.
just	about	 no 	 body 	 	 support 	 s 	 	research	on	 weapon 	 s 	 	-	grade	fuel	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	by	2011	that	 get 	 s 	 	to	be	a	big	block	,	and	you	put	these	two	together	,	that	's	the	 controll 	 ing 	 	influence	in	iran	.
out	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	there	are	a	bunch	of	people	--	ahmadinejad	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	who	would	like	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	build	a	bomb	,	but	test	a	bomb	.
that	power	 disappear 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	;	 no 	 body 	 	 support 	 s 	 	that	by	2011	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	all	 shrink 	 ing 	 	,	the	power	is	all	 drift 	 ing 	 	out	here	,	so	the	 out 	 come 	 	is	going	to	be	the	 weapon 	 s 	 	-	grade	fuel	.
who	are	the	 winner 	 s 	 	and	who	are	the	 lose 	 rs 	 	in	iran	?
take	a	look	at	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	they	're	growing	in	power	,	and	by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	a	while	ago	before	the	current	economic	crisis	,	and	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	get	 steep 	 er 	 	.
these	 folk 	 s 	 	are	the	 money 	 ed 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	in	iran	,	the	 bank 	 ers 	 	,	the	oil	people	,	the	 bazaar 	 ies 	 	.
they	are	growing	in	 politic 	 al 	 	 cl 	 out 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 m 	 ullah 	 s 	 	are	 isol 	 ating 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	with	the	exception	of	one	group	of	 m 	 ullah 	 s 	 	,	who	are	not	well	known	to	americans	.
that	's	 th 	 is 	 	line	here	,	growing	in	power	,	these	are	what	the	iranians	call	the	 quiet 	 ists 	 	.
these	are	the	ayatollahs	,	 most 	 ly 	 	based	in	qom	,	who	have	great	 cl 	 out 	 	in	the	religious	community	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	quiet	on	 politic 	 s 	 	and	are	going	to	be	 get 	 ting 	 	 loud 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	see	iran	going	in	an	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	direction	,	a	direction	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	what	khomeini	had	in	mind	.
here	is	mr.	ahmadinejad	.
two	 thing 	 s 	 	to	notice	:	he	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 weak 	 er 	 	,	and	while	he	 get 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	attention	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	he	is	not	a	major	player	in	iran	.
he	is	on	the	way	down	.
ok	,	so	i	'd	like	you	to	take	a	little	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	is	not	 predict 	 able 	 	:	the	stock	market	is	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	me	,	not	 predict 	 able 	 	,	but	most	 complic 	 ated 	 	 negoti 	 ations 	 	are	 predict 	 able 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	health	policy	,	education	,	 litig 	 ation 	 	,	 merge 	 rs 	 	,	all	of	these	are	 complic 	 ated 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	 predict 	 able 	 	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	technology	can	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	.
and	the	reason	that	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	predict	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	is	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	you	might	run	a	 hedg 	 e 	 	fund	and	make	money	off	of	it	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	can	predict	what	people	will	do	,	you	can	engineer	what	they	will	do	.
and	if	you	engineer	what	they	do	you	can	change	the	world	,	you	can	get	a	better	result	.
i	would	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	one	thought	,	which	is	for	me	,	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	theme	of	 th 	 is 	 	 gather 	 ing 	 	,	and	is	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	theme	of	 th 	 is 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	world	.
when	people	say	to	you	,	``	that	's	 im 	 possible 	 	,	``	you	say	back	to	them	,	``	when	you	say	'	that	's	 im 	 possible 	 	,	'	you	're	 con 	 fused 	 	with	,	'	i	do	n't	know	how	to	do	it	.	'	``	thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	one	question	for	you	.
that	was	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
i	love	that	you	put	it	out	there	.
i	got	 ver 	 y 	 	nervous	 half 	 way 	 	through	the	talk	 th 	 ough 	 	,	just	 panic 	 king 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	you	'd	 include 	 d 	 	in	your	model	,	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	 put 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 predict 	 ion 	 	out	there	might	change	the	result	.
we	've	got	800	people	in	tehran	who	watch	tedtalks	.
bruce	bueno	de	mesquita	:	i	've	thought	about	that	,	and	since	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	of	work	for	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	community	,	they	've	 al 	 so 	 	 ponder 	 ed 	 	that	.
it	would	be	a	good	thing	if	people	paid	more	attention	,	took	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	and	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	the	same	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 calcul 	 ations 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	would	change	 thing 	 s 	 	.	but	it	would	change	 thing 	 s 	 	in	two	 benefici 	 al 	 	ways	.
it	would	 ha 	 sten 	 	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	people	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	an	 agree 	 ment 	 	,	and	so	it	would	 s 	 ave 	 	 every 	 body 	 	a	lot	of	grief	and	time	.
and	,	it	would	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	an	 agree 	 ment 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	was	happy	with	,	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	them	so	much	--	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	i	do	,	i	 manipul 	 ate 	 	them	.
so	it	would	be	a	good	thing	.
ca	:	so	you	're	kind	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	``	people	of	iran	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	your	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	lets	go	there	.	``
bbm	:	well	,	people	of	iran	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	are	going	to	evolve	to	want	,	and	we	could	get	there	a	lot	 soon 	 er 	 	,	and	you	would	suffer	a	lot	less	trouble	from	economic	 sanct 	 ions 	 	,	and	we	would	suffer	a	lot	less	fear	of	the	use	of	 militar 	 y 	 	force	on	our	end	,	and	the	world	would	be	a	better	place	.
ca	:	here	's	 hop 	 ing 	 	they	hear	it	that	way	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	bruce	.
bbm	:	thank	you	.
