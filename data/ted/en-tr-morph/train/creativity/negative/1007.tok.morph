we	've	got	a	real	problem	with	math	education	right	now	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	no	one	's	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	it	think	it	's	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	 un 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	hard	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	employ	them	think	they	do	n't	know	 en 	 ough 	 	.
 government 	 s 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	's	a	big	deal	for	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	but	do	n't	know	how	to	fix	it	.
and	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	.
yet	math	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	world	than	at	any	point	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
so	at	one	end	we	've	got	 fall 	 ing 	 	interest	in	education	in	math	,	and	at	the	other	end	we	've	got	a	more	 mathematic 	 al 	 	world	,	a	more	 quant 	 itative 	 	world	than	we	ever	have	had	.
so	what	's	the	problem	,	why	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 cha 	 sm 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	up	,	and	what	can	we	do	to	fix	it	?
well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	the	answer	is	 star 	 ing 	 	us	right	in	the	face	:	use	 computer 	 s 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 correct 	 ly 	 	using	 computer 	 s 	 	is	the	silver	bullet	for	making	math	education	work	.
so	to	explain	that	,	let	me	first	talk	a	bit	about	what	math	 look 	 s 	 	like	in	the	real	world	and	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	in	education	.
see	,	in	the	real	world	math	is	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	.
it	's	 d 	 one 	 	by	 geo 	 logists 	 	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	different	people	--	 model 	 ing 	 	and	 simul 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	.
but	in	education	it	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	--	dumbed	-	down	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 calcul 	 ating 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	by	hand	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	seem	simple	and	not	difficult	like	in	the	real	world	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	if	you	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	thing	about	math	:	math	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	math	--	like	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	--	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	--	like	``	am	i	drunk	?	``
and	then	you	get	an	answer	that	's	 quant 	 itative 	 	in	the	modern	world	.
you	would	n't	have	 expect 	 ed 	 	that	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	back	.
but	now	you	can	find	out	all	about	--	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	my	weight	is	a	little	 high 	 er 	 	than	that	,	but	--	all	about	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	zoom	out	a	bit	and	ask	,	why	are	we	 teach 	 ing 	 	people	math	?
what	's	the	point	of	 teach 	 ing 	 	people	math	?
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	why	are	we	 teach 	 ing 	 	them	math	in	general	?
why	is	it	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	education	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	 com 	 puls 	 ory 	 	subject	?
well	,	i	think	there	are	about	three	 reason 	 s 	 	:	technical	 job 	 s 	 	so	critical	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	what	i	call	``	 every 	 day 	 	living	``	--	to	function	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	've	got	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 quant 	 itative 	 	,	much	more	so	than	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	:	figure	out	your	 mortgage 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 skeptic 	 al 	 	of	government	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	what	i	would	call	 some 	 thing 	 	like	logical	mind	training	,	logical	 think 	 ing 	 	.
over	the	 year 	 s 	 	we	've	put	so	much	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	process	and	think	logically	.	it	's	part	of	human	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	learn	that	math	is	a	great	way	to	do	that	.
so	let	's	ask	 an 	 other 	 	question	.
what	is	math	?
what	do	we	mean	when	we	say	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	math	,	or	 educ 	 ating 	 	people	to	do	math	?
well	,	i	think	it	's	about	four	 step 	 s 	 	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	posing	the	right	question	.
what	is	it	that	we	want	to	ask	?	what	is	it	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	out	here	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	thing	most	 screw 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	,	beyond	 virtual 	 ly 	 	any	other	part	of	 do 	 ing 	 	math	.
people	ask	the	wrong	question	,	and	 surprising 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	they	get	the	wrong	answer	,	for	that	reason	,	if	not	for	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	the	next	thing	is	take	that	problem	and	turn	it	from	a	real	world	problem	 in 	 to 	 	a	math	problem	.
that	's	stage	two	.
once	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	,	then	there	's	the	computation	step	.
turn	it	from	that	 in 	 to 	 	some	answer	in	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	form	.
and	of	course	,	math	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	at	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	turn	it	back	to	the	real	world	.
did	it	answer	the	question	?
and	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 ify 	 	it	--	 cruci 	 al 	 	step	.
now	here	's	the	crazy	thing	right	now	.
in	math	education	,	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	about	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	80	percent	of	the	time	 teach 	 ing 	 	people	to	do	step	three	by	hand	.
yet	,	that	's	the	one	step	 computer 	 s 	 	can	do	better	than	any	human	after	 year 	 s 	 	of	practice	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	ought	to	be	using	 computer 	 s 	 	to	do	step	three	and	using	the	 student 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	much	more	effort	on	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	do	 step 	 s 	 	one	,	two	and	four	--	 conceptual 	 izing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	them	,	 get 	 ting 	 	the	teacher	to	run	them	through	how	to	do	that	.
see	,	 cruci 	 al 	 	point	here	:	math	is	not	equal	to	 calcul 	 ating 	 	.
math	is	a	much	 broad 	 er 	 	subject	than	 calcul 	 ating 	 	.
now	it	's	 understand 	 able 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	all	got	 intertwine 	 d 	 	over	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
there	was	 on 	 ly 	 	one	way	to	do	 calcul 	 ating 	 	and	that	was	by	hand	.
but	in	the	last	few	 decade 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
we	've	had	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	any	ancient	subject	that	i	could	ever	imagine	with	 computer 	 s 	 	.
 calcul 	 ating 	 	was	 typical 	 ly 	 	the	 limit 	 ing 	 	step	,	and	now	often	it	is	n't	.
so	i	think	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	fact	that	math	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 liberate 	 d 	 	from	 calcul 	 ating 	 	.
but	that	math	 liber 	 ation 	 	did	n't	get	 in 	 to 	 	education	yet	.
see	,	i	think	of	 calcul 	 ating 	 	,	in	a	sense	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	of	math	.
it	's	the	chore	.
it	's	the	thing	you	'd	like	to	avoid	if	you	can	,	like	to	get	a	machine	to	do	.
it	's	a	 mean 	 s 	 	to	an	end	,	not	an	end	in	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	 autom 	 ation 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	have	that	 machine 	 ry 	 	.
 computer 	 s 	 	allow	us	to	do	that	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	small	problem	by	any	 mean 	 s 	 	.
i	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	,	just	 to 	 day 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	we	 s 	 pent 	 	about	106	average	world	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	people	how	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	by	hand	.
that	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	amount	of	human	endeavor	.
so	we	better	be	damn	 s 	 ure 	 	--	and	by	the	way	,	they	did	n't	even	have	 f 	 un 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	most	of	them	--	so	we	better	be	damn	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	know	why	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	real	purpose	.
i	think	we	should	be	 assum 	 ing 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 calcul 	 ating 	 	and	 on 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	hand	 calcul 	 ations 	 	where	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	sense	to	teach	people	that	.
and	i	think	there	are	some	 case 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	mental	arithmetic	.
i	still	do	a	lot	of	that	,	 main 	 ly 	 	for	estimating	.
people	say	,	``	is	 s 	 uch 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	true	?	``
and	i	'll	say	,	``	hmm	,	not	 s 	 ure 	 	.	``	i	'll	think	about	it	 rough 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	still	 quick 	 er 	 	to	do	that	and	more	practical	.
so	i	think	 practical 	 ity 	 	is	one	case	where	it	's	worth	 teach 	 ing 	 	people	by	hand	.
and	then	there	are	certain	conceptual	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	 al 	 so 	 	benefit	from	hand	 calcul 	 ating 	 	,	but	i	think	they	're	 relat 	 ively 	 	small	in	number	.
one	thing	i	often	ask	about	is	ancient	greek	and	how	 th 	 is 	 	 relat 	 es 	 	.
see	,	the	thing	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	right	now	is	we	're	forcing	people	to	learn	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	major	subject	.
i	'm	not	for	one	minute	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	,	if	people	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	hand	 calcul 	 ating 	 	or	in	 follow 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 interest 	 s 	 	in	any	subject	 how 	 ever 	 	bizarre	--	they	should	do	that	.
that	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	the	right	thing	,	for	people	to	follow	 the 	 ir 	 	self	-	interest	.
i	was	 some 	 what 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	ancient	greek	,	but	i	do	n't	think	that	we	should	force	the	entire	population	to	learn	a	subject	like	ancient	greek	.
i	do	n't	think	it	's	 warrant 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	what	we	're	making	people	do	and	the	subject	that	's	sort	of	 main 	 stream 	 	and	the	subject	that	,	in	a	sense	,	people	might	follow	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	interest	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	be	 spike 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
so	what	are	the	 issue 	 s 	 	people	 br 	 ing 	 	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	one	of	them	is	,	they	say	,	you	need	to	get	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	first	.
you	should	n't	use	the	machine	 un 	 til 	 	you	get	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	the	subject	.
so	my	usual	question	is	,	what	do	you	mean	by	``	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	?	``
 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	what	?
are	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	 driv 	 ing 	 	a	car	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	service	it	,	or	design	it	for	that	matter	?
are	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	writing	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	 sharp 	 en 	 	a	 qu 	 ill 	 	?
i	do	n't	think	so	.
i	think	you	need	to	 separat 	 e 	 	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	what	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	from	how	it	 get 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	and	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	of	how	it	 get 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	and	 autom 	 ation 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	make	that	 separat 	 ion 	 	.
a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	true	that	to	drive	a	car	you	kind	of	 need 	 ed 	 	to	know	a	lot	about	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	of	the	car	and	how	the	 ignit 	 ion 	 	 tim 	 ing 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	 autom 	 ation 	 	in	 car 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	that	to	 separat 	 e 	 	,	so	 driv 	 ing 	 	is	now	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	subject	,	so	to	speak	,	from	 engineer 	 ing 	 	of	the	car	or	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	service	it	.
so	 autom 	 ation 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 separat 	 ion 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	--	in	the	case	of	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	future	case	of	 math 	 s 	 	--	a	 democrat 	 ized 	 	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
it	can	be	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	number	of	people	who	can	 re 	 ally 	 	work	with	that	.
so	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
people	 con 	 fuse 	 	,	in	my	view	,	the	order	of	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	with	the	order	in	which	they	should	use	them	for	 teach 	 ing 	 	.
so	just	 be 	 cause 	 	paper	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	before	 computer 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	mean	you	get	more	to	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	the	subject	by	using	paper	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	computer	to	teach	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
my	daughter	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	nice	anecdote	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
she	 enjoy 	 s 	 	making	what	she	 call 	 s 	 	``	paper	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	``
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	one	day	,	``	you	know	,	when	i	was	your	age	,	i	did	n't	make	these	.
why	do	you	think	that	was	?	``
and	after	a	second	or	two	,	 care 	 fully 	 	 reflect 	 ing 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	paper	?	``
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	born	after	 computer 	 s 	 	and	paper	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	which	order	you	're	taught	with	them	in	,	you	just	want	to	have	the	best	tool	.
so	 an 	 other 	 	one	that	 come 	 s 	 	up	is	``	 computer 	 s 	 	dumb	math	down	.	``
that	 some 	 how 	 	,	if	you	use	a	computer	,	it	's	all	 mind 	 less 	 	button	-	 push 	 ing 	 	,	but	if	you	do	it	by	hand	,	it	's	all	intellectual	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	kind	of	 annoy 	 s 	 	me	,	i	must	say	.
do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	math	that	most	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	in	school	is	more	than	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 procedure 	 s 	 	to	 problem 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	,	for	 reason 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	get	?
i	do	n't	think	so	.
and	what	's	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	what	they	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	there	is	n't	even	 practical 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
might	have	 be 	 en 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	but	it	is	n't	 any 	 more 	 	.
when	they	're	out	of	education	,	they	do	it	on	a	computer	.
just	to	be	clear	,	i	think	 computer 	 s 	 	can	 re 	 ally 	 	help	with	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	it	more	conceptual	.
now	,	of	course	,	like	any	great	tool	,	they	can	be	used	 complete 	 ly 	 	 mind 	 lessly 	 	,	like	 turn 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 multi 	 media 	 	show	,	like	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	was	 show 	 n 	 	of	solving	an	 equ 	 ation 	 	by	hand	,	where	the	computer	was	the	teacher	--	show	the	student	how	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	and	solve	it	by	hand	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	nuts	.
why	are	we	using	 computer 	 s 	 	to	show	a	student	how	to	solve	a	problem	by	hand	that	the	computer	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 way 	 	?
all	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
let	me	show	you	that	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	make	 problem 	 s 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	.
see	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	in	school	,	you	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	solve	 quad 	 ratic 	 	 equ 	 ations 	 	.
but	you	see	,	when	you	're	using	a	computer	,	you	can	just	 substitut 	 e 	 	.
you	can	make	it	a	 quar 	 tic 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	.	make	it	kind	of	 hard 	 er 	 	,	 calcul 	 ating 	 	-	wise	.
same	 principle 	 s 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	--	 calcul 	 ations 	 	,	 hard 	 er 	 	.
and	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	real	world	look	 nut 	 ty 	 	and	 horr 	 ible 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	've	got	hair	all	over	them	.
they	're	not	just	simple	,	dumbed	-	down	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	see	in	school	math	.
and	think	of	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	.
do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	biology	and	all	of	these	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	so	 benefit 	 ed 	 	from	 computer 	 s 	 	and	 math 	 s 	 	have	 some 	 how 	 	 conceptual 	 ly 	 	gotten	 reduc 	 ed 	 	by	using	 computer 	 s 	 	?
i	do	n't	think	so	--	 quit 	 e 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
so	the	problem	we	've	 re 	 ally 	 	got	in	math	education	is	not	that	 computer 	 s 	 	might	dumb	it	down	,	but	that	we	have	dumbed	-	down	 problem 	 s 	 	right	now	.
well	,	 an 	 other 	 	issue	people	 br 	 ing 	 	up	is	 some 	 how 	 	that	hand	 calcul 	 ating 	 	 procedure 	 s 	 	teach	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
so	if	you	go	through	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	you	can	get	the	answer	,	you	can	understand	how	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	the	system	work	better	.
i	think	there	is	one	thing	that	i	think	 ver 	 y 	 	valid	here	,	which	is	that	i	think	 understand 	 ing 	 	 procedure 	 s 	 	and	 process 	 es 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	there	's	a	fantastic	way	to	do	that	in	the	modern	world	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 programm 	 ing 	 	.
 programm 	 ing 	 	is	how	most	 procedure 	 s 	 	and	 process 	 es 	 	get	written	down	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	great	way	to	engage	 student 	 s 	 	much	more	and	to	check	they	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	.
if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	check	you	understand	math	then	write	a	program	to	do	it	.
so	 programm 	 ing 	 	is	the	way	i	think	we	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
so	to	be	clear	,	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	am	 suggest 	 ing 	 	here	is	we	have	a	 un 	 ique 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	 math 	 s 	 	both	more	practical	and	more	conceptual	,	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
i	ca	n't	think	of	any	other	subject	where	that	's	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	possible	.
it	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	some	kind	of	choice	between	the	 voc 	 ation 	 al 	 	and	the	intellectual	.
but	i	think	we	can	do	both	at	the	same	time	here	.
and	we	open	up	so	 man 	 y 	 	more	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
you	can	do	so	 man 	 y 	 	more	 problem 	 s 	 	.
what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	we	gain	from	 th 	 is 	 	is	 student 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 intuit 	 ion 	 	and	experience	in	far	 great 	 er 	 	 quant 	 ities 	 	than	they	've	ever	got	before	.
and	experience	of	 hard 	 er 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	play	with	the	math	,	interact	with	it	,	feel	it	.
we	want	people	who	can	feel	the	math	 instinct 	 ively 	 	.
that	's	what	 computer 	 s 	 	allow	us	to	do	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	do	is	 re 	 order 	 	the	curriculum	.
 tradition 	 ally 	 	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	by	how	difficult	it	is	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	,	but	now	we	can	 re 	 order 	 	it	by	how	difficult	it	is	to	understand	the	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	hard	the	 calcul 	 ating 	 	.
so	 calcul 	 us 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 tradition 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taught	 ver 	 y 	 	late	.
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	it	's	damn	hard	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 calcul 	 ations 	 	,	that	's	the	problem	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	are	 a 	 men 	 able 	 	to	a	much	 young 	 er 	 	age	group	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	built	for	my	daughter	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	 in 	 crease 	 	the	number	of	 side 	 s 	 	of	a	polygon	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	number	.
and	of	course	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	circle	.
and	by	the	way	,	she	was	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 insist 	 ent 	 	on	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	change	the	color	,	an	 import 	 ant 	 	feature	for	 th 	 is 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 	.
you	can	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	early	step	 in 	 to 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	and	 different 	 ial 	 	 calcul 	 us 	 	and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	take	 thing 	 s 	 	to	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	--	and	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 side 	 s 	 	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	number	of	 side 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
that	's	a	view	of	the	world	that	we	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	give	people	for	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	yet	,	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	practical	view	of	the	world	.
so	one	of	the	 road 	 block 	 s 	 	we	have	in	moving	 th 	 is 	 	agenda	forward	is	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	.
in	the	end	,	if	we	test	 every 	 one 	 	by	hand	in	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	,	it	's	kind	of	hard	to	get	the	 curr 	 ic 	 ula 	 	 change 	 d 	 	to	a	point	where	they	can	use	 computer 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 semester 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	it	's	so	 import 	 ant 	 	--	so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	get	 computer 	 s 	 	in	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	can	ask	 question 	 s 	 	,	real	 question 	 s 	 	,	 question 	 s 	 	like	,	what	's	the	best	life	 insur 	 ance 	 	policy	to	get	?	--	real	 question 	 s 	 	that	people	have	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 every 	 day 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	some	dumbed	-	down	model	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	actual	model	where	we	can	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	optimize	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	 protect 	 ion 	 	do	i	need	?
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	do	to	the	 payment 	 s 	 	and	to	the	interest	rates	and	so	forth	?
now	i	'm	not	for	one	minute	 suggest 	 ing 	 	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	kind	of	question	that	should	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	in	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	,	but	i	think	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	type	that	right	now	just	 get 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	and	is	critical	for	people	's	real	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	 believ 	 e 	 	[	there	is	]	critical	reform	we	have	to	do	in	computer	-	based	math	.
we	have	got	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	can	move	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	forward	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	based	on	the	idea	that	people	can	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	some	 option 	 al 	 	extra	.
and	the	country	that	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	first	will	,	in	my	view	,	leapfrog	 other 	 s 	 	in	 achiev 	 ing 	 	a	new	 eco 	 nomy 	 	even	,	an	 improv 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	an	 improv 	 ed 	 	 out 	 look 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	even	talk	about	us	moving	from	what	we	often	call	now	the	``	knowledge	 eco 	 nomy 	 	``	to	what	we	might	call	a	``	 computation 	 al 	 	knowledge	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	``	where	high	-	level	math	is	 integ 	 ral 	 	to	what	 every 	 one 	 	 do 	 es 	 	in	the	way	that	knowledge	 current 	 ly 	 	is	.
we	can	engage	so	 man 	 y 	 	more	 student 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	can	have	a	better	time	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	let	's	understand	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	 increment 	 al 	 	sort	of	change	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	cross	the	 cha 	 sm 	 	here	between	school	math	and	the	real	-	world	math	.
and	you	know	if	you	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	a	 cha 	 sm 	 	,	you	end	up	making	it	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	if	you	did	n't	start	at	all	--	 big 	 ger 	 	disaster	.
no	,	what	i	'm	 suggest 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	should	leap	off	,	we	should	 in 	 crease 	 	our	 velo 	 city 	 	so	it	's	high	,	and	we	should	leap	off	one	side	and	go	the	other	--	of	course	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 calcul 	 ated 	 	our	 different 	 ial 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
so	i	want	to	see	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 renew 	 ed 	 	,	 change 	 d 	 	math	curriculum	built	from	the	ground	up	,	based	on	 computer 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	there	,	 computer 	 s 	 	that	are	now	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	 al 	 most 	 	.
 calcul 	 ating 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	are	 every 	 where 	 	and	will	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 every 	 where 	 	in	a	small	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	i	'm	not	even	 s 	 ure 	 	if	we	should	brand	the	subject	 a 	 s 	 	math	,	but	what	i	am	 s 	 ure 	 	is	it	's	the	 main 	 stream 	 	subject	of	the	future	.
let	's	go	for	it	,	and	while	we	're	about	it	,	let	's	have	a	bit	of	 f 	 un 	 	,	for	us	,	for	the	 student 	 s 	 	and	for	ted	here	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
