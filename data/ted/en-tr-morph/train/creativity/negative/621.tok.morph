i	love	theater	.
i	love	the	idea	that	you	can	transform	,	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 body 	 	else	and	look	at	life	with	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
i	love	the	idea	that	people	will	 s 	 it 	 	in	one	room	for	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	and	listen	.
the	idea	that	in	that	room	at	that	moment	,	 every 	 one 	 	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	age	,	 the 	 ir 	 	gender	,	 the 	 ir 	 	race	,	 the 	 ir 	 	color	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	together	.
at	that	moment	,	we	transcend	space	and	time	together	.
theater	 awake 	 ns 	 	our	 sense 	 s 	 	and	 open 	 s 	 	the	door	to	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
and	our	ability	to	imagine	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	 explore 	 rs 	 	.
our	ability	to	imagine	 make 	 s 	 	us	 inventor 	 s 	 	and	 creator 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 ique 	 	.
i	was	 commission 	 ed 	 	in	2003	to	create	an	original	show	,	and	 beg 	 an 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	``	upwake	.	``
``	upwake	``	 tell 	 s 	 	the	story	of	zero	,	a	modern	-	day	business	man	,	going	to	work	with	his	life	in	a	 suit 	 case 	 	,	 s 	 tuck 	 	between	dream	and	 re 	 ality 	 	and	not	able	to	decipher	the	two	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	``	upwake	``	to	have	the	same	 audio 	 visual 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	movie	would	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	let	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	run	wild	.
so	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	the	story	that	was	moving	in	my	head	.
if	antoine	de	saint	-	exupery	,	the	author	of	``	the	little	prince	,	``	 we 	 re 	 	here	,	he	would	have	drawn	three	 hole 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	that	box	and	told	you	your	sheep	was	 in 	 side 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	look	 close 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	will	begin	to	appear	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	box	;	these	are	the	 render 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	from	head	to	paper	to	screen	to	life	.
in	``	upwake	``	 building 	 s 	 	wear	 suit 	 s 	 	,	zero	tap	 dance 	 s 	 	on	a	giant	 key 	 board 	 	,	 clone 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	with	a	scanner	,	 tame 	 s 	 	and	 whip 	 s 	 	the	computer	 mic 	 e 	 	,	 sail 	 s 	 	away	 in 	 to 	 	 dream 	 s 	 cape 	 	from	a	single	piece	of	paper	and	 launch 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	 environment 	 s 	 	that	 move 	 d 	 	and	 morph 	 ed 	 	like	an	 illusion 	 ist 	 	.
go	from	one	world	to	 an 	 other 	 	in	a	second	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	humor	,	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	 simpl 	 icity 	 	and	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	use	 metaphor 	 s 	 	to	suggest	 idea 	 s 	 	.
at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	show	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	zero	 deejay 	 s 	 	dream	and	 re 	 ality 	 	.
technology	is	an	instrument	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	me	to	manifest	my	 vision 	 s 	 	in	high	definition	,	live	,	on	stage	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	would	like	to	talk	to	you	about	the	relationship	between	theater	and	technology	.
let	's	start	with	technology	.
all	right	.	let	's	start	with	theater	.

the	use	of	 anim 	 ation 	 	and	 project 	 ion 	 	was	a	process	of	 discover 	 y 	 	.

there	are	no	special	 effect 	 s 	 	in	``	upwake	,	``	no	artifice	.

so	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 relat 	 ively 	 	,	a	new	show	that	we	're	now	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	tour	.
and	in	austin	,	texas	,	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	give	small	 demonst 	 ration 	 s 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	afternoon	.
when	i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	one	of	the	 school 	 s 	 	,	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	not	expect	 th 	 is 	 	:	six	hundred	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	a	 gymnas 	 ium 	 	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	a	little	nervous	 perform 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	 cost 	 ume 	 	--	 re 	 ally 	 	--	and	make	-	up	.
but	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	came	to	me	 after 	 ward 	 	and	told	me	they	had	n't	 s 	 een 	 	the	 kid 	 s 	 	that	attentive	.
and	i	think	the	reason	why	is	that	i	was	able	to	use	 the 	 ir 	 	language	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	in	order	to	transport	them	 in 	 to 	 	 an 	 other 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
zero	 be 	 came 	 	a	person	and	not	just	a	character	in	a	play	.
zero	 do 	 es 	 	not	speak	,	is	 n 	 either 	 	man	nor	woman	.
zero	is	zero	,	a	little	hero	of	the	21st	century	,	and	zero	can	touch	so	 man 	 y 	 	more	people	than	i	possibly	could	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	much	about	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	new	 discipline 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	box	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	about	taking	theater	out	of	 it 	 s 	 	box	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	street	 perform 	 er 	 	,	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	connect	.
and	that	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	're	a	bit	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	if	you	're	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	of	human	 appear 	 ance 	 	,	then	people	will	feel	 inc 	 lined 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	and	to	feel	out	loud	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	made	 some 	 thing 	 	 reson 	 ate 	 	 with 	 in 	 	them	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 myster 	 y 	 	of	the	person	they	're	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	and	 connect 	 ing 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	them	to	be	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	just	a	bit	more	.
 be 	 cause 	 	through	your	mask	,	they	let	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	go	.
 be 	 ing 	 	human	is	an	art	form	.
i	know	theater	can	improve	the	quality	of	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	i	know	theater	can	heal	.

the	idea	is	simple	,	 bas 	 ic 	 	.	it	's	not	original	,	but	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	.
there	is	a	revolution	.
it	's	a	human	and	 techno 	 logical 	 	revolution	.
it	's	motion	and	emotion	.
it	's	information	.

it	's	conceptual	.	it	's	universal	.	it	's	beyond	 word 	 s 	 	and	 number 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
the	natural	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	science	and	art	 find 	 ing 	 	each	other	to	better	touch	and	define	the	human	experience	.
there	is	a	revolution	in	the	way	that	we	think	,	in	the	way	that	we	share	,	and	the	way	that	we	express	our	 st 	 ories 	 	,	our	evolution	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	time	of	communication	,	 connect 	 ion 	 	and	creative	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
