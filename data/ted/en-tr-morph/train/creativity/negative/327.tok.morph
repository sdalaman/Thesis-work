my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	is	 short 	 cut 	 s 	 	.
the	master	of	 short 	 cut 	 s 	 	--	it	's	,	of	course	,	nature	.
but	i	will	 demonst 	 rate 	 	different	ways	to	get	rid	of	 difficult 	 ies 	 	and	go	to	the	point	,	to	find	an	answer	 prob 	 ably 	 	much	 quick 	 er 	 	than	arthur	did	.	so	,	first	,	we	 viol 	 ate 	 	the	common	sense	,	the	logic	.	all	of	you	,	if	you	hold	your	hand	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	90	 degree 	 s 	 	--	all	of	you	.	not	you	.
all	of	you	,	right	?	palm	up	.
if	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	common	,	the	logic	 say 	 s 	 	you	must	turn	the	wrist	.
do	you	agree	?
good	.
but	i	will	first	teach	you	a	method	,	how	you	can	do	it	 with 	 out 	 	moving	the	wrist	,	and	then	the	 short 	 cut 	 	.
you	can	do	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	right	?
hold	the	hand	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	palm	up	.
do	n't	move	the	wrist	.	the	wrist	is	--	i	 do 	 es 	 	n't	speak	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	but	i	do	the	best	,	what	i	are	.
right	-	 mold 	 ed 	 	you	say	,	with	iron	?
that	was	a	joke	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	and	i	--	ok	.
hold	the	hand	palm	up	.	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	do	n't	move	the	wrist	.
over	the	heart	,	do	n't	move	the	wrist	.
forward	,	do	n't	move	the	wrist	.
up	,	do	n't	move	the	wrist	.	over	the	heart	,	do	n't	move	the	wrist	.
and	forward	.	 yea 	 h 	 	.
now	--	--	logic	,	logically	,	you	have	got	to	 th 	 is 	 	position	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	moving	the	wrist	.
now	,	the	 short 	 cut 	 	.
but	it	was	six	 move 	 s 	 	.	now	with	one	move	.
i	start	here	,	palm	down	,	you	can	follow	.
and	then	look	at	me	.
 yea 	 h 	 	!
one	move	.	ok	.
so	,	that	was	the	 warm 	 ing 	 	up	.
now	,	i	need	an	 assist 	 ant 	 	.
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	a	nice	girl	before	,	zoe	.
she	 ha 	 s 	 	left	.	no	!	a	big	hand	.
good	.	nice	.	and	you	can	 s 	 it 	 	over	there	.
one	item	here	was	water	,	right	?
and	i	will	give	my	tribute	to	water	.
i	think	it	's	 en 	 ough 	 	with	water	for	me	.	the	other	 guy 	 s 	 	can	talk	about	--	 cheer 	 s 	 	.
beer	 ha 	 s 	 	about	--	there	's	a	lot	of	water	in	beer	.
so	,	now	i	will	 demonst 	 rate 	 	different	ways	of	control	 card 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
and	i	think	i	'll	take	off	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
i	work	with	a	special	method	to	do	it	,	quick	.
i	work	with	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	--	oh	,	sorry	--	control	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	...
 memor 	 y 	 	system	,	right	?
so	,	if	--	i	have	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	 poke 	 r 	 	.	i	like	to	gamble	.
 official 	 ly 	 	,	i	do	n't	gamble	but	...
so	,	if	we	are	--	if	we	have	five	person	,	and	i	will	do	a	five	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	 poke 	 r 	 	game	.
now	i	will	interact	.	so	a	different	person	all	the	time	,	so	not	the	same	person	can	answer	.
so	we	have	an	 agree 	 ment 	 	.
which	one	 s 	 hall 	 	have	a	good	 poke 	 r 	 	hand	?
which	number	?	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	or	five	?
lennart	green	:	three	--	good	.
and	here	,	i	had	a	mat	here	to	make	it	a	little	--	the	critical	moment	is	--	sorry	.
if	a	card	 s 	 hark 	 	 gather 	 s 	 	the	 card 	 s 	 	together	,	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	when	he	--	before	he	 deal 	 s 	 	the	card	.	now	,	so	i	think	,	number	three	,	i	have	 arrange 	 d 	 	them	in	a	full	house	.
with	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	and	--	it	's	ok	--	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	and	 ten 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	.	i	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	will	explain	 lat 	 er 	 	.	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	.
i	start	with	three	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	.
so	here	you	see	the	contrast	when	i	treat	the	 card 	 s 	 	.
and	two	 ten 	 s 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.	thank	you	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	the	other	hand	is	good	,	if	all	the	other	 guy 	 s 	 	have	good	 hand 	 s 	 	too	.
so	these	 guy 	 s 	 	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 strong 	 er 	 	hand	--	three	 ace 	 s 	 	and	two	 king 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	 beat 	 s 	 	them	with	four	of	a	kind	,	or	 de 	 uce 	 	--	 de 	 uce 	 	.
no	 re 	 action 	 	?	that	with	even	--	ok	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	.
these	look	in	order	,	i	'm	 prob 	 ably 	 	--	 hope 	 fully 	 	--	 yea 	 h 	 	.	three	,	four	,	five	,	six	,	seven	and	...
but	,	of	course	,	i	will	have	the	winning	hand	.
ten	,	jack	,	 que 	 en 	 	,	king	,	ace	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.	so	,	good	.
so	the	hand	that	 look 	 s 	 	so	good	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	number	three	,	at	the	end	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 low 	 est 	 	hand	.
 s 	 uch 	 	life	.	right	?
so	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	mix	them	.
now	,	if	you	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	i	will	 demonst 	 rate 	 	some	 under 	 ground 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	?
i	work	with	kind	of	estimation	,	 shuffl 	 e 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	--	ah	,	good	.
 impress 	 ive 	 	.	thank	you	.
so	,	first	,	the	first	term	is	estimation	.
here	,	i	can	estimate	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	 card 	 s 	 	are	put	between	my	royal	flush	.
of	course	,	i	can	count	the	 card 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	much	 quick 	 er 	 	.
right	?	you	agree	.
so	here	i	have	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	i	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	the	 card 	 s 	 	are	.
so	here	,	i	can	make	a	bet	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 point 	 s 	 	where	i	get	my	money	.
so	here	:	10	,	jack	,	 que 	 en 	 	,	king	,	ace	.
ok	.
next	is	a	term	--	i	do	it	quick	.	i	call	 th 	 is 	 	 steal 	 ing 	 	.
so	here	,	i	think	i	know	about	where	the	 card 	 s 	 	are	.
i	will	spread	the	 card 	 s 	 	and	you	'll	say	stop	,	when	i	point	to	them	,	right	.	point	,	say	stop	.
zoe	:	stop	.
lg	:	here	--	you	see	some	are	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	?
and	that	's	the	 steal 	 ing 	 	 card 	 s 	 	,	which	i	did	.
ok	.
now	,	 an 	 other 	 	term	 call 	 ed 	 	 shuffl 	 e 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	.
 shuffl 	 e 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	i	keep	track	of	the	 card 	 s 	 	,	even	if	 an 	 other 	 	person	 shuffl 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	 risk 	 y 	 	.
so	--	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	look	,	now	,	i	can	still	see	it	.
you	agree	?	but	if	you	square	--	square	,	and	 shuffl 	 e 	 	,	and	then	a	cut	.
so	here	,	to	follow	my	 card 	 s 	 	,	i	must	look	at	the	 shuffl 	 e 	 	from	the	begin	--	ah	,	we	are	 start 	 ed 	 	together	.	it	's	ok	,	it	's	ok	.
come	to	--	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	.
i	'm	 jok 	 ing 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	?
any	style	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	good	.
here	i	have	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	do	n't	like	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	.
i	work	direct	with	the	right	brain	.
if	you	pass	the	left	brain	,	you	have	to	take	care	of	logic	and	common	sense	.
direct	in	the	right	brain	,	that	's	much	better	.	and	so	--	--	arthur	benjamin	did	a	little	of	the	same	thing	.
and	if	you	work	with	,	in	the	right	atmosphere	,	with	humor	,	you	have	--	that	's	the	 pass 	 word 	 	to	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	bank	of	knowledge	,	where	you	can	find	any	solution	of	any	problem	.
ok	.	now	,	i	drop	the	 card 	 s 	 	,	and	you	say	stop	 any 	 way 	 	,	right	?
not	at	the	last	card	.
zoe	:	stop	.	lg	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
when	i	'm	sober	,	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	much	 quick 	 er 	 	,	but	we	will	check	.
ah	,	not	in	order	,	it	--	that	was	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
no	,	i	'm	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
no	,	now	and	then	i	put	in	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	,	just	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	how	difficult	it	is	.
right	?
 yea 	 h 	 	,	last	night	i	 for 	 got 	 	that	.	that	was	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
but	now	i	'm	glad	i	remember	it	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	deck	is	 b 	 ought 	 	here	.	sorry	.
i	have	a	little	pad	to	make	it	a	little	 soft 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	deck	is	 b 	 ought 	 	here	in	america	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.	``	and	 th 	 is 	 	deck	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	but	not	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	know	,	if	you	check	,	if	you	press	at	the	right	 spot 	 s 	 	,	you	see	how	thin	and	 flex 	 ible 	 	 th 	 is 	 	deck	is	,	right	?
now	,	you	can	carry	 th 	 is 	 	in	your	wallet	,	so	...
you	do	n't	see	it	,	make	no	 re 	 action 	 	?
so	,	but	here	,	and	--	is	the	camera	 get 	 ting 	 	too	much	?	no	.
 yea 	 h 	 	?
lg	:	 par 	 don 	 	?	but	then	,	when	we	will	have	it	back	,	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	not	too	much	.
then	you	have	to	push	it	down	 aga 	 in 	 	.
here	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	if	you	push	these	 heap 	 s 	 	--	 every 	 one 	 	see	--	push	them	together	so	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 inter 	 lace 	 d 	 	,	right	?	 yea 	 h 	 	,	good	.
perfect	.
just	push	them	through	,	good	.	thank	you	.
and	then	,	i	will	 demonst 	 rate 	 	a	thing	from	russian	satellite	,	 steal 	 en 	 	--	 stole 	 n 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 cop 	 ied 	 	from	america	but	we	will	see	.
here	--	 short 	 cut 	 s 	 	.	i	talk	about	 short 	 cut 	 s 	 	.
now	i	go	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	through	the	deck	and	try	to	find	some	pattern	.
the	new	 cha 	 os 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	old	,	right	?
but	you	know	,	i	think	you	are	familiar	with	 fract 	 al 	 s 	 	--	the	mandelbrot	 spiral 	 s 	 	and	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	 memor 	 ize 	 	 card 	 s 	 	in	a	pattern	way	,	and	not	 concent 	 rate 	 	.	if	you	 concent 	 rate 	 	and	 calcul 	 ate 	 	,	then	you	go	to	--	then	it	's	the	left	brain	.	but	if	you	just	look	and	talk	in	 an 	 other 	 	language	...
 yea 	 h 	 	,	great	.
i	think	i	have	it	.
so	now	,	different	 person 	 s 	 	,	 old 	 er 	 	,	tap	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	name	any	card	,	 any 	 one 	 	.
lg	:	jack	of	 s 	 pad 	 es 	 	.
jack	of	 s 	 pad 	 es 	 	.
i	think	jack	of	 s 	 pad 	 es 	 	is	number	12	from	the	top	.
one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	,	six	,	seven	,	eight	,	nine	,	10	,	11	,	12.	 y 	 es 	 	,	right	.
so	--	oh	,	jack	of	 s 	 pad 	 es 	 	.
you	 s 	 aid 	 	 s 	 pad 	 es 	 	?	lg	:	ah	.
my	fault	.	do	n't	applaud	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 club 	 s 	 	.
so	,	jack	of	 s 	 pad 	 es 	 	.
i	think	...
23	--	24	,	sorry	,	24	.
one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	,	six	,	seven	,	eight	,	nine	,	10	,	11	,	12	,	13	,	14	,	15	,	16	,	17	,	18	,	19	,	20	,	21	,	22	,	23	--	ah	,	25	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
it	's	the	last	.
now	,	i	do	it	 quick 	 er 	 	,	better	.
ok	.	 an 	 other 	 	person	.	oh	,	i	 for 	 got 	 	,	i	should	n't	 shuffl 	 e 	 	but	i	think	--	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	my	 techni 	 que 	 	is	to	peek	,	all	the	time	.
when	i	lift	the	heap	,	i	peek	.
you	see	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	perfect	.
three	,	four	,	five	,	six	.	then	i	 calcul 	 ate 	 	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	good	.
 an 	 other 	 	person	,	 an 	 other 	 	card	.
lg	:	seven	of	 diamond 	 s 	 	.	perfect	,	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	seven	.
so	i	will	do	it	quick	,	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	,	but	in	 s 	 low 	 	motion	,	so	you	can	follow	.
seven	of	?
lg	:	 diamond 	 s 	 	,	good	.	i	start	here	.
good	,	thank	you	.
the	thing	i	did	--	i	 peek 	 ed 	 	.
i	know	where	the	card	 we 	 re 	 	,	then	i	chose	it	.	so	 an 	 other 	 	person	,	 an 	 other 	 	card	.
 an 	 other 	 	person	.
lg	:	 par 	 don 	 	?
lg	:	ten	of	 diamond 	 s 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
i	think	i	do	it	the	same	way	.	i	like	to	,	so	i	know	where	it	is	.
ten	of	 diamond 	 s 	 	.
but	now	i	do	it	the	regular	speed	,	right	?
ten	of	 diamond 	 s 	 	.
good	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	will	cut	?	lift	.
 excel 	 lent 	 	.
so	,	thank	you	.	 an 	 other 	 	person	,	 an 	 other 	 	card	.
lg	:	 par 	 don 	 	?
lg	:	five	of	 club 	 s 	 	.	it	's	not	the	same	person	,	even	if	it	's	the	same	spot	.
we	can	take	some	over	there	 lat 	 er 	 	.	so	now	,	i	will	drop	the	 card 	 s 	 	.
and	you	'll	say	stop	,	 any 	 where 	 	.	got	it	?
five	of	 club 	 s 	 	.
not	the	last	.	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	's	difficult	to	find	a	card	here	.
we	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	person	who	 s 	 aid 	 	five	of	 club 	 s 	 	say	stop	,	when	the	 card 	 s 	 	are	in	the	air	,	right	?
lg	:	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
ok	.
ok	,	i	had	to	use	a	little	force	there	.
i	think	we	 s 	 ave 	 	five	of	 club 	 s 	 	.
and	now	a	card	with	a	contrast	of	five	of	 club 	 s 	 	.
lg	:	 que 	 en 	 	of	 heart 	 s 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
 excel 	 lent 	 	.	i	love	that	card	.
here	,	i	will	do	the	most	difficult	thing	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	las	vegas	,	and	you	're	 bet 	 ting 	 	,	and	you	let	the	other	 guy 	 s 	 	peek	 th 	 is 	 	card	by	 mistak 	 e 	 	.	feel	,	it	's	just	the	regular	,	one	card	.
and	now	,	when	i	lift	 th 	 is 	 	card	,	it	 s 	 hall 	 	be	your	card	.	what	was	your	card	?
lg	:	 que 	 en 	 	of	?	 que 	 en 	 	of	 heart 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	a	tough	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	right	?
so	here	,	i	grab	--	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	?	five	of	 club 	 s 	 	...
and	 que 	 en 	 	of	 heart 	 s 	 	.	 y 	 es 	 	!
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tough	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	here	i	must	take	advantage	of	--	i	 s 	 witch 	 	it	with	the	five	of	 club 	 s 	 	.
so	,	now	a	false	count	.
which	card	 s 	 hall 	 	i	use	?	 que 	 en 	 	or	five	?
zoe	:	the	 que 	 en 	 	.	lg	:	 que 	 en 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
so	,	i	use	the	 que 	 en 	 	,	and	here	's	five	of	 club 	 s 	 	.
the	false	count	--	and	the	number	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	,	six	,	seven	,	eight	--	you	say	the	same	card	all	the	time	.
eight	,	nine	,	10	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kind	of	optical	deal	,	right	?
when	i	put	one	card	at	a	table	--	look	,	it	's	not	one	card	.	it	's	--	look	,	it	's	a	bunch	of	 card 	 s 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	impression	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.
now	some	hard	stuff	.
i	think	we	keep	the	 que 	 en 	 	here	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
now	,	to	the	 satellite 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	--	oh	sorry	,	do	n't	look	at	the	beam	.	my	fault	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	high	-	frequency	laser	,	and	it	's	 en 	 ough 	 	with	a	fraction	of	a	second	to	destroy	the	retina	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
right	,	sorry	,	my	--	i	should	have	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	that	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
but	you	can	relax	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	half	an	hour	before	it	 work 	 s 	 	,	so	you	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	time	to	see	my	whole	performance	.
now	,	i	put	the	laser	here	,	and	--	now	,	when	i	deal	the	 card 	 s 	 	in	the	laser	,	i	know	where	they	are	but	--	 y 	 es 	 	?
did	the	camera	got	it	?
no	?
they	did	n't	?
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
lg	:	ok	,	i	'll	take	 an 	 other 	 	group	.
do	the	 camera 	 s 	 	see	the	 card 	 s 	 	now	?
no	?
lg	:	but	you	see	the	hand	.
ah	,	good	,	good	,	good	.	but	now	.
so	now	,	that	was	the	reason	,	right	?
you	see	the	 card 	 s 	 	?	 y 	 es 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	good	.
now	--	--	one	guy	 laugh 	 ed 	 	.	so	now	,	to	find	the	 que 	 en 	 	,	do	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	:	take	back	the	other	one	,	take	back	the	 que 	 en 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	a	little	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
i	 like 	 d 	 	it	.	now	,	a	little	more	difficult	.
name	--	 any 	 one 	 	,	name	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	any	suit	.
