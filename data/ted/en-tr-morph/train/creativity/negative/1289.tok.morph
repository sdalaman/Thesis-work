my	subject	 to 	 day 	 	is	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
and	in	that	spirit	,	i	want	to	spring	on	you	all	a	pop	quiz	.
ready	?
when	 do 	 es 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	begin	?
now	 a 	 s 	 	you	ponder	that	question	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	first	day	of	 pre 	 school 	 	or	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	,	the	first	time	that	 kid 	 s 	 	are	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	with	a	teacher	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	you	've	 call 	 ed 	 	to	mind	the	toddler	phase	when	children	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	walk	and	talk	and	use	a	 for 	 k 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	've	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	the	zero	-	to	-	three	 move 	 ment 	 	,	which	 assert 	 s 	 	that	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 year 	 s 	 	for	 learn 	 ing 	 	are	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	so	your	answer	to	my	question	would	be	:	 learn 	 ing 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	at	birth	.
well	 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	present	to	you	an	idea	that	may	be	surprising	and	may	even	seem	 im 	 plausible 	 	,	but	which	is	 support 	 ed 	 	by	the	 lat 	 est 	 	evidence	from	 psycho 	 logy 	 	and	biology	.
and	that	is	that	some	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	we	ever	do	 happen 	 s 	 	before	we	're	born	,	while	we	're	still	in	the	womb	.
now	i	'm	a	science	 report 	 er 	 	.
i	write	 book 	 s 	 	and	magazine	 article 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	a	mother	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 role 	 s 	 	came	together	for	me	in	a	book	that	i	wrote	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 origin 	 s 	 	.	``
``	 origin 	 s 	 	``	is	a	report	from	the	front	lines	of	an	 excit 	 ing 	 	new	field	 call 	 ed 	 	 fet 	 al 	 	 origin 	 s 	 	.
 fet 	 al 	 	 origin 	 s 	 	is	a	scientific	discipline	that	 emerge 	 d 	 	just	about	two	 decade 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	it	's	based	on	the	 theor 	 y 	 	that	our	health	and	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	 through 	 out 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	is	 cruci 	 ally 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	the	nine	 month 	 s 	 	we	 s 	 pend 	 	in	the	womb	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	was	of	more	than	just	intellectual	interest	to	me	.
i	was	 my 	 self 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	while	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	the	research	for	the	book	.
and	one	of	the	most	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	i	took	from	 th 	 is 	 	work	is	that	we	're	all	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	the	world	even	before	we	enter	it	.
when	we	hold	our	 bab 	 ies 	 	for	the	first	time	,	we	might	imagine	that	they	're	clean	 s 	 late 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 mark 	 ed 	 	by	life	,	when	in	fact	,	they	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	shaped	by	us	and	by	the	 part 	 icular 	 	world	we	live	in	.
 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	share	with	you	some	of	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 discover 	 ing 	 	about	what	 fetus 	 es 	 	learn	while	they	're	still	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	'	 bell 	 ies 	 	.
first	of	all	,	they	learn	the	sound	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	'	 voice 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	have	to	travel	through	the	mother	's	abdominal	tissue	and	through	the	 am 	 ni 	 otic 	 	fluid	that	 surround 	 s 	 	the	fetus	,	the	 voice 	 s 	 	 fetus 	 es 	 	hear	,	 start 	 ing 	 	around	the	fourth	month	of	 gest 	 ation 	 	,	are	 mut 	 ed 	 	and	 muffle 	 d 	 	.
one	 research 	 er 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	sound	a	lot	like	the	the	voice	of	charlie	 brow 	 n 	 	's	teacher	in	the	old	``	 peanut 	 s 	 	``	cartoon	.
but	the	 pregn 	 ant 	 	woman	's	own	voice	 reverbe 	 rates 	 	through	her	body	,	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	fetus	much	more	 read 	 ily 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	the	fetus	is	with	her	all	the	time	,	it	 hear 	 s 	 	her	voice	a	lot	.
once	the	baby	's	born	,	it	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	her	voice	and	it	 prefer 	 s 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	her	voice	over	 any 	 one 	 	else	's	.
how	can	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	?
 new 	 born 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	ca	n't	do	much	,	but	one	thing	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	is	 suck 	 ing 	 	.
 research 	 ers 	 	take	advantage	of	 th 	 is 	 	fact	by	 rig 	 ging 	 	up	two	rubber	 nipple 	 s 	 	,	so	that	if	a	baby	 suck 	 s 	 	on	one	,	it	 hear 	 s 	 	a	 record 	 ing 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	mother	's	voice	on	a	pair	of	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	and	if	it	 suck 	 s 	 	on	the	other	nipple	,	it	 hear 	 s 	 	a	 record 	 ing 	 	of	a	female	 strange 	 r 	 	's	voice	.
 bab 	 ies 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	show	 the 	 ir 	 	 pre 	 ference 	 	by	 choos 	 ing 	 	the	first	one	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	take	advantage	of	the	fact	that	 bab 	 ies 	 	will	 s 	 low 	 	down	 the 	 ir 	 	 suck 	 ing 	 	when	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	them	and	resume	 the 	 ir 	 	fast	 suck 	 ing 	 	when	they	get	 bor 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	 research 	 ers 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	,	after	women	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	read	 a 	 loud 	 	a	section	of	dr.	seuss	'	``	the	cat	in	the	hat	``	while	they	 we 	 re 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 new 	 born 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	 pass 	 age 	 	when	they	hear	it	 out 	 side 	 	the	womb	.
my	 favor 	 ite 	 	experiment	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	is	the	one	that	 show 	 ed 	 	that	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	of	women	who	 watch 	 ed 	 	a	certain	soap	opera	every	day	 dur 	 ing 	 	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	 recogn 	 ized 	 	the	theme	song	of	that	show	once	they	 we 	 re 	 	born	.
so	 fetus 	 es 	 	are	even	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	the	 part 	 icular 	 	language	that	's	spoken	in	the	world	that	they	'll	be	born	 in 	 to 	 	.
a	 stud 	 y 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	last	year	found	that	from	birth	,	from	the	moment	of	birth	,	 bab 	 ies 	 	cry	in	the	accent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	mother	's	native	language	.
french	 bab 	 ies 	 	cry	on	a	 ris 	 ing 	 	note	while	german	 bab 	 ies 	 	end	on	a	 fall 	 ing 	 	note	,	 imit 	 ating 	 	the	 melo 	 d 	 ic 	 	 con 	 tour 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 language 	 s 	 	.
now	why	would	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 fet 	 al 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	be	 use 	 ful 	 	?
it	may	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	aid	the	baby	's	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
from	the	moment	of	birth	,	the	baby	 respond 	 s 	 	most	to	the	voice	of	the	person	who	is	most	 like 	 ly 	 	to	care	for	it	--	 it 	 s 	 	mother	.
it	even	 make 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 cri 	 es 	 	sound	like	the	mother	's	language	,	which	may	further	endear	the	baby	to	the	mother	,	and	which	may	give	the	baby	a	head	start	in	the	critical	task	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	understand	and	speak	 it 	 s 	 	native	language	.
but	it	's	not	just	 sound 	 s 	 	that	 fetus 	 es 	 	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	in	 ut 	 ero 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 taste 	 s 	 	and	 smell 	 s 	 	.
by	seven	 month 	 s 	 	of	 gest 	 ation 	 	,	the	fetus	'	taste	 bud 	 s 	 	are	fully	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 ol 	 factor 	 y 	 	 receptor 	 s 	 	,	which	allow	it	to	smell	,	are	 function 	 ing 	 	.
the	 flavor 	 s 	 	of	the	food	a	 pregn 	 ant 	 	woman	eats	find	 the 	 ir 	 	way	 in 	 to 	 	the	 am 	 ni 	 otic 	 	fluid	,	which	is	 continu 	 ously 	 	 swallow 	 ed 	 	by	the	fetus	.
 bab 	 ies 	 	seem	to	remember	and	prefer	these	 taste 	 s 	 	once	they	're	out	in	the	world	.
in	one	experiment	,	a	group	of	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	drink	a	lot	of	carrot	juice	 dur 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	third	 trim 	 est 	 er 	 	of	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	,	while	 an 	 other 	 	group	of	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	 d 	 rank 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	water	.
six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	women	's	 infant 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	 ce 	 real 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	carrot	juice	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 observ 	 ed 	 	while	they	ate	it	.
the	 off 	 spring 	 	of	the	carrot	juice	 drink 	 ing 	 	women	ate	more	carrot	-	 flavor 	 ed 	 	 ce 	 real 	 	,	and	from	the	 look 	 s 	 	of	it	,	they	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	enjoy	it	more	.
a	sort	of	french	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	was	carried	out	in	dijon	,	france	where	 research 	 ers 	 	found	that	 mother 	 s 	 	who	 consum 	 ed 	 	food	and	drink	 flavor 	 ed 	 	with	licorice	-	 flavor 	 ed 	 	 an 	 ise 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	a	 pre 	 ference 	 	for	 an 	 ise 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	first	day	of	life	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	tested	 lat 	 er 	 	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	fourth	day	of	life	.
 bab 	 ies 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	did	not	eat	 an 	 ise 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	a	 re 	 action 	 	that	 transl 	 ated 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	 yu 	 ck 	 	.	``
what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	 fetus 	 es 	 	are	 effective 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	taught	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	about	what	is	safe	and	good	to	eat	.
 fetus 	 es 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	taught	about	the	 part 	 icular 	 	culture	that	they	'll	be	 join 	 ing 	 	through	one	of	culture	's	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	,	which	is	food	.
they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	the	 character 	 istic 	 	 flavor 	 s 	 	and	 spice 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	's	 cu 	 is 	 ine 	 	even	before	birth	.
now	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 fetus 	 es 	 	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	even	 big 	 ger 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	.
but	before	i	get	to	that	,	i	want	to	address	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	may	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	.
the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 fet 	 al 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	may	conjure	up	for	you	 attempt 	 s 	 	to	enrich	the	fetus	--	like	 play 	 ing 	 	mozart	through	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	 place 	 d 	 	on	a	 pregn 	 ant 	 	 bel 	 ly 	 	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	nine	-	month	-	long	process	of	 mold 	 ing 	 	and	 sha 	 ping 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	the	womb	is	a	lot	more	visceral	and	 con 	 sequent 	 ial 	 	than	that	.
much	of	what	a	 pregn 	 ant 	 	woman	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	in	her	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	--	the	air	she	 breathe 	 s 	 	,	the	food	and	drink	she	 consum 	 es 	 	,	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	she	's	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	,	even	the	 emotion 	 s 	 	she	 feel 	 s 	 	--	are	 share 	 d 	 	in	some	fashion	with	her	fetus	.
they	make	up	a	mix	of	 influence 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	individual	and	 idio 	 syn 	 cratic 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	woman	 her 	 self 	 	.
the	fetus	 in 	 corporate 	 s 	 	these	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	body	,	 make 	 s 	 	them	part	of	 it 	 s 	 	 fl 	 esh 	 	and	blood	.
and	often	it	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	more	.
it	 treat 	 s 	 	these	 ma 	 ternal 	 	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	information	,	 a 	 s 	 	what	i	like	to	call	 bio 	 logical 	 	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	from	the	world	 out 	 side 	 	.
so	what	a	fetus	is	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	in	 ut 	 ero 	 	is	not	mozart	's	``	magic	 flut 	 e 	 	``	but	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 question 	 s 	 	much	more	critical	to	 it 	 s 	 	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
will	it	be	born	 in 	 to 	 	a	world	of	abundance	will	it	be	safe	and	 protect 	 ed 	 	,	or	will	it	face	constant	 danger 	 s 	 	and	 threat 	 s 	 	?
will	it	live	a	long	,	 fruit 	 ful 	 	life	or	a	short	,	 har 	 ri 	 ed 	 	one	?
the	 pregn 	 ant 	 	woman	's	diet	and	stress	level	in	 part 	 icular 	 	provide	 import 	 ant 	 	 clue 	 s 	 	to	 prevail 	 ing 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	like	a	finger	 lift 	 ed 	 	to	the	wind	.
the	 result 	 ing 	 	 t 	 un 	 ing 	 	and	 tweak 	 ing 	 	of	a	fetus	'	brain	and	other	 organ 	 s 	 	are	part	of	what	give	us	 human 	 s 	 	our	enormous	 flex 	 ibility 	 	,	our	ability	to	 thriv 	 e 	 	in	a	huge	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 environment 	 s 	 	,	from	the	country	to	the	city	,	from	the	 t 	 un 	 dra 	 	to	the	desert	.
to	conclude	,	i	want	to	tell	you	two	 st 	 ories 	 	about	how	 mother 	 s 	 	teach	 the 	 ir 	 	children	about	the	world	even	before	they	're	born	.
in	the	 aut 	 umn 	 	of	1944	,	the	 dark 	 est 	 	 day 	 s 	 	of	world	war	ii	,	german	 troop 	 s 	 	 blockade 	 d 	 	western	holland	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	away	all	 ship 	 ments 	 	of	food	.
the	 open 	 ing 	 	of	the	nazi	's	siege	was	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	one	of	the	 harsh 	 est 	 	 winter 	 s 	 	in	 decade 	 s 	 	--	so	cold	the	water	in	the	 can 	 al 	 s 	 	froze	solid	.
soon	food	 be 	 came 	 	scarce	,	with	 man 	 y 	 	dutch	 surviv 	 ing 	 	on	just	500	 calorie 	 s 	 	a	day	--	a	quarter	of	what	they	 consum 	 ed 	 	before	the	war	.
 a 	 s 	 	 week 	 s 	 	of	 depriv 	 ation 	 	 stretch 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 month 	 s 	 	,	some	 resort 	 ed 	 	to	eating	tulip	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
by	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	may	,	the	nation	's	 care 	 fully 	 	 ration 	 ed 	 	food	 re 	 serve 	 	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	.
the	 spect 	 er 	 	of	mass	 starv 	 ation 	 	 loom 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	on	may	5th	,	1945	,	the	siege	came	to	a	sudden	end	when	holland	was	 liberate 	 d 	 	by	the	 al 	 lies 	 	.
the	``	 hung 	 er 	 	winter	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	it	came	to	be	known	,	 kill 	 ed 	 	some	10,000	people	and	 weak 	 ened 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	more	.
but	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	population	that	was	 affect 	 ed 	 	--	the	40,000	 fetus 	 es 	 	in	 ut 	 ero 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	siege	.
some	of	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 	in	 high 	 er 	 	rates	of	 still 	 birth 	 s 	 	,	birth	 defect 	 s 	 	,	low	birth	 weight 	 s 	 	and	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
but	 other 	 s 	 	would	n't	be	 discover 	 ed 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
 decade 	 s 	 	after	the	``	 hung 	 er 	 	winter	,	``	 research 	 ers 	 	 document 	 ed 	 	that	people	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	siege	have	more	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	more	diabetes	and	more	heart	disease	in	 lat 	 er 	 	life	than	 individual 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 gest 	 ated 	 	under	normal	 condition 	 s 	 	.
these	 individual 	 s 	 	'	 pre 	 natal 	 	experience	of	 starv 	 ation 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	in	myriad	ways	.
they	have	 high 	 er 	 	blood	pressure	,	 poor 	 er 	 	cholesterol	 profile 	 s 	 	and	 reduc 	 ed 	 	glucose	 toler 	 ance 	 	--	a	 pre 	 cursor 	 	of	diabetes	.
why	would	 under 	 nutrition 	 	in	the	womb	result	in	disease	 lat 	 er 	 	?
is	that	 fetus 	 es 	 	are	making	the	best	of	a	bad	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
when	food	is	scarce	,	they	divert	 nutrient 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	organ	,	the	brain	,	and	away	from	other	 organ 	 s 	 	like	the	heart	and	liver	.
 th 	 is 	 	 keep 	 s 	 	the	fetus	 al 	 ive 	 	in	the	short	-	term	,	but	the	bill	 come 	 s 	 	due	 lat 	 er 	 	on	in	life	when	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 organ 	 s 	 	,	 depriv 	 ed 	 	early	on	,	 be 	 come 	 	more	susceptible	to	disease	.
but	that	may	not	be	all	that	's	going	on	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	 fetus 	 es 	 	are	taking	 cue 	 s 	 	from	the	 intra 	 ut 	 er 	 ine 	 	environment	and	 tailor 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	physiology	 accord 	 ing 	 ly 	 	.
they	're	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	for	the	kind	of	world	they	will	 en 	 counter 	 	on	the	other	side	of	the	womb	.
the	fetus	 adjust 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 metabol 	 ism 	 	and	other	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 process 	 es 	 	in	 anticip 	 ation 	 	of	the	environment	that	 await 	 s 	 	it	.
and	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	the	fetus	'	 predict 	 ion 	 	is	what	 it 	 s 	 	mother	eats	.
the	 meal 	 s 	 	a	 pregn 	 ant 	 	woman	 consum 	 es 	 	constitute	a	kind	of	story	,	a	 fair 	 y 	 	tale	of	abundance	or	a	grim	 chronic 	 le 	 	of	 depriv 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	story	 im 	 part 	 s 	 	information	that	the	fetus	uses	to	organize	 it 	 s 	 	body	and	 it 	 s 	 	 system 	 s 	 	--	an	 adapt 	 ation 	 	to	 prevail 	 ing 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	that	 facilitate 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	future	 surviv 	 al 	 	.

the	real	trouble	 come 	 s 	 	when	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	are	,	in	a	sense	,	 un 	 reli 	 able 	 	 nar 	 rator 	 s 	 	,	when	 fetus 	 es 	 	are	led	to	expect	a	world	of	 scar 	 city 	 	and	are	born	 in 	 stead 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	world	of	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	children	of	the	dutch	``	 hung 	 er 	 	winter	.	``
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 high 	 er 	 	rates	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	diabetes	and	heart	disease	are	the	result	.
bodies	that	 we 	 re 	 	built	to	hang	onto	every	calorie	found	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	in	the	 super 	 flu 	 ous 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	of	the	post	-	war	western	diet	.
the	world	they	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	while	in	 ut 	 ero 	 	was	not	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	world	 in 	 to 	 	which	they	 we 	 re 	 	born	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	story	.
at	8:46	 a.m 	 . 	 	on	september	11th	,	2001	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	in	the	 vic 	 in 	 ity 	 	of	the	world	trade	center	in	new	york	--	 commute 	 rs 	 	 s 	 pill 	 ing 	 	off	 train 	 s 	 	,	 wait 	 re 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	setting	 table 	 s 	 	for	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	rush	,	 broker 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	the	 phone 	 s 	 	on	wall	street	.
1,700	of	these	people	 we 	 re 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	.
when	the	 plane 	 s 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	and	the	 tower 	 s 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	women	 experience 	 d 	 	the	same	 horr 	 ors 	 	 inflict 	 ed 	 	on	other	 surviv 	 ors 	 	of	the	disaster	--	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	and	 con 	 fusion 	 	,	the	 roll 	 ing 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	of	 potential 	 ly 	 	toxic	dust	and	 deb 	 ris 	 	,	the	heart	-	 pound 	 ing 	 	fear	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
about	a	year	after	9/11	,	 research 	 ers 	 	 examine 	 d 	 	a	group	of	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	the	world	trade	center	attack	.
in	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	women	who	 develop 	 ed 	 	post	-	 trauma 	 tic 	 	stress	syndrome	,	or	ptsd	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 or 	 deal 	 	,	 research 	 ers 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	marker	of	 s 	 us 	 cept 	 ibility 	 	to	ptsd	--	an	effect	that	was	most	 pronounce 	 d 	 	in	 infant 	 s 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	the	 catastroph 	 e 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	third	 trim 	 est 	 er 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	 mother 	 s 	 	with	post	-	 trauma 	 tic 	 	stress	syndrome	had	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	a	 vulner 	 ability 	 	to	the	condition	to	 the 	 ir 	 	children	while	they	 we 	 re 	 	still	in	 ut 	 ero 	 	.
now	consider	 th 	 is 	 	:	post	-	 trauma 	 tic 	 	stress	syndrome	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 re 	 action 	 	to	stress	gone	 ver 	 y 	 	wrong	,	 caus 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	tremendous	 un 	 necess 	 ary 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	ptsd	.
what	 look 	 s 	 	like	 path 	 ology 	 	to	us	may	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	a	 use 	 ful 	 	 adapt 	 ation 	 	in	some	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
in	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	environment	,	the	 character 	 istic 	 	 manifest 	 ations 	 	of	ptsd	--	a	hyper	-	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	one	's	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	a	quick	-	trigger	 respons 	 e 	 	to	danger	--	could	 s 	 ave 	 	 some 	 one 	 	's	life	.
the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	the	 pre 	 natal 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	of	ptsd	risk	is	 adapt 	 ive 	 	is	still	 specul 	 ative 	 	,	but	i	find	it	 ra 	 ther 	 	poignant	.
it	would	mean	that	,	even	before	birth	,	 mother 	 s 	 	are	 war 	 ning 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	that	it	's	a	wild	world	out	there	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	,	``	be	 care 	 ful 	 	.	``
let	me	be	clear	.
 fet 	 al 	 	 origin 	 s 	 	research	is	not	about	 b 	 lam 	 ing 	 	women	for	what	 happen 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	.
it	's	about	 discover 	 ing 	 	how	best	to	promote	the	health	and	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	the	next	generation	.
that	 import 	 ant 	 	effort	must	include	a	focus	on	what	 fetus 	 es 	 	learn	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	nine	 month 	 s 	 	they	 s 	 pend 	 	in	the	womb	.
 learn 	 ing 	 	is	one	of	life	's	most	essential	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	and	it	 begin 	 s 	 	much	 ear 	 lier 	 	than	we	ever	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
thank	you	.
