all	of	the	 plan 	 s 	 	for	me	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	made	.

and	when	i	was	seven	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	a	search	party	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	my	home	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	the	next	karmapa	,	and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	my	mom	and	dad	,	and	the	news	came	to	me	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	i	was	the	karmapa	.
and	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	people	ask	me	a	lot	,	how	did	that	feel	.
how	did	that	feel	when	they	came	and	 whisk 	 ed 	 	you	away	,	and	your	 life 	 style 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	?
and	what	i	 most 	 ly 	 	say	is	that	,	at	that	time	,	it	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	idea	to	me	.
i	thought	that	 thing 	 s 	 	would	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 f 	 un 	 	and	there	would	be	more	 thing 	 s 	 	to	play	with	.
td	:	but	it	did	n't	turn	out	to	be	so	 f 	 un 	 	and	 entertain 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	thought	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
i	was	 place 	 d 	 	in	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 strict 	 ly 	 	controlled	environment	.
and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	different	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	my	education	and	so	forth	,	 we 	 re 	 	 heap 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	me	.
i	was	 separat 	 ed 	 	,	 large 	 ly 	 	,	from	my	family	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	my	mother	and	father	.
i	did	n't	have	have	 man 	 y 	 	personal	 friend 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	time	with	,	but	i	was	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	perform	these	 pre 	 scribed 	 	 du 	 ties 	 	.
so	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	my	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	about	an	 entertain 	 ing 	 	life	of	 be 	 ing 	 	the	karmapa	was	n't	going	to	come	true	.
it	more	felt	to	be	the	case	to	me	that	i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	like	a	statue	,	and	i	was	to	 s 	 it 	 	in	one	place	like	a	statue	would	.
td	:	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	i	felt	that	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	my	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	--	and	,	of	course	,	now	i	'm	even	further	away	.
when	i	was	14	,	i	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	from	tibet	and	 be 	 came 	 	even	further	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	my	mother	and	father	,	my	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	my	 home 	 land 	 	.
but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	there	's	no	real	sense	of	 separat 	 ion 	 	from	me	in	my	heart	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	love	that	i	feel	for	these	people	.
i	feel	,	still	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 connect 	 ion 	 	of	love	for	all	of	these	people	and	for	the	land	.
td	:	and	i	still	do	get	to	keep	in	touch	with	my	mother	and	father	,	i	talk	to	my	mother	once	in	a	blue	moon	on	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	.
and	my	experience	is	that	,	when	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	her	,	with	every	second	that	 pass 	 es 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	our	conversation	,	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	love	that	 bind 	 s 	 	us	is	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	us	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	together	.
td	:	so	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	a	few	 remark 	 s 	 	about	my	personal	 back 	 ground 	 	.
and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	with	you	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	i	think	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	from	different	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	and	 place 	 s 	 	can	come	together	,	 ex 	 change 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	and	form	 relationship 	 s 	 	of	 friend 	 ship 	 	with	each	other	.
and	i	think	that	's	 symbol 	 ic 	 	of	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	in	general	,	that	the	world	is	 be 	 coming 	 	 small 	 er 	 	and	 small 	 er 	 	,	and	that	all	of	the	 people 	 s 	 	in	the	world	are	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	more	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
that	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	but	we	should	 al 	 so 	 	remember	that	we	should	have	a	similar	process	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
 a 	 long 	 	with	 out 	 ward 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	 in 	 crease 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	there	should	be	 in 	 ward 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	 deepen 	 ing 	 	of	our	heart	 connect 	 ions 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	our	 out 	 ward 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
so	we	spoke	and	we	heard	some	about	design	 th 	 is 	 	week	.
i	think	that	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	to	remember	that	we	need	to	keep	 push 	 ing 	 	forward	on	the	endeavor	of	the	design	of	the	heart	.
we	heard	a	lot	about	technology	 th 	 is 	 	week	,	and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	to	remember	to	invest	a	lot	of	our	energy	in	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	technology	of	the	heart	.
td	:	so	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	 some 	 what 	 	happy	about	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 develop 	 ments 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	,	still	,	i	feel	a	sense	of	impediment	,	to	the	ability	that	we	have	to	connect	with	each	other	on	a	heart	-	to	-	heart	,	or	a	mind	-	to	-	mind	,	level	.
i	feel	that	there	are	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 get 	 ting 	 	in	the	way	.
tc	:	my	relationship	to	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	heart	-	to	-	heart	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	or	mind	-	to	-	mind	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	spiritual	 lead 	 er 	 	,	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	open	my	heart	to	 other 	 s 	 	and	 off 	 er 	 	 my 	 self 	 	up	for	heart	-	to	-	heart	and	mind	-	to	-	mind	 connect 	 ions 	 	in	a	genuine	way	with	other	people	,	but	at	the	same	time	,	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 advise 	 d 	 	that	i	need	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	over	the	heart	-	to	-	heart	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	in	a	position	like	mine	,	if	i	do	n't	 re 	 ly 	 	 prim 	 arily 	 	on	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	then	 some 	 thing 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	may	happen	to	me	.
so	it	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	paradox	at	play	there	.
but	i	had	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	experience	once	,	when	a	group	from	afghanistan	came	to	visit	me	,	and	we	had	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	conversation	.
td	:	so	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	bamiyan	buddhas	,	which	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	 we 	 re 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	afghanistan	.
but	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	our	conversation	was	the	different	approach	to	 spiritual 	 ity 	 	on	the	part	of	the	muslim	and	buddhist	 tradition 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	in	muslim	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 teach 	 ing 	 s 	 	around	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 idol 	 at 	 ry 	 	,	you	do	n't	find	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	physical	 represent 	 ations 	 	of	 div 	 in 	 ity 	 	or	of	spiritual	 liber 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	in	the	buddhist	tradition	,	where	,	of	course	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 statue 	 s 	 	of	the	buddha	that	are	 high 	 ly 	 	 revere 	 d 	 	.
so	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	the	 tradition 	 s 	 	and	what	 man 	 y 	 	people	 perceive 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	bamiyan	buddhas	,	but	i	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	the	 suggest 	 ion 	 	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	could	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	positive	way	.
what	we	saw	in	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	bamiyan	buddhas	was	the	 deple 	 tion 	 	of	matter	,	some	solid	 sub 	 stance 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	down	and	 dis 	 integ 	 rating 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	could	look	at	that	to	be	more	similar	to	the	 fall 	 ing 	 	of	the	berlin	wall	,	where	a	divide	that	had	 ke 	 pt 	 	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	people	 a 	 part 	 	had	 collapse 	 d 	 	and	 open 	 ed 	 	up	a	door	for	further	communication	.
so	i	think	that	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	possible	for	us	to	 der 	 ive 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	positive	that	can	help	us	understand	one	 an 	 other 	 	better	.
td	:	so	,	with	regard	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	at	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	that	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	that	we	make	should	n't	create	a	further	burden	for	us	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	should	be	used	to	improve	our	fundamental	 life 	 style 	 	of	how	we	live	in	the	world	.
td	:	of	course	,	i	 re 	 jo 	 ice 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	the	growth	and	the	rise	of	the	noble	land	of	india	,	the	great	country	of	india	,	but	at	the	same	time	,	i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	some	of	us	have	 acknowledg 	 ed 	 	,	we	need	to	be	aware	that	some	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	rise	are	coming	at	the	cost	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	ground	on	which	we	stand	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	 climb 	 ing 	 	the	tree	,	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	order	to	climb	the	tree	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 under 	 min 	 ing 	 	the	tree	's	 ver 	 y 	 	root	.
and	so	,	what	i	think	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	is	a	question	of	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	information	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	that	and	 lett 	 ing 	 	that	shift	our	 motiv 	 ation 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	 since 	 re 	 	and	 genuine 	 ly 	 	positive	.
we	have	hear	,	 th 	 is 	 	week	,	about	the	 horr 	 ible 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	that	so	 man 	 y 	 	women	of	the	world	are	 endur 	 ing 	 	day	-	to	-	day	.
we	have	that	information	,	but	what	often	 happen 	 s 	 	to	us	is	that	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	to	pay	attention	to	it	.
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	to	allow	that	to	cause	there	to	be	a	shift	in	our	 heart 	 s 	 	.
so	i	think	the	way	forward	for	the	world	--	one	that	will	 br 	 ing 	 	the	path	of	 out 	 er 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	 harmon 	 y 	 	with	the	real	root	of	happiness	--	is	that	we	allow	the	information	that	we	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	make	a	change	in	our	heart	.
td	:	so	i	think	that	 since 	 re 	 	 motiv 	 ation 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	our	future	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,	or	deep	sense	of	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 sink 	 ing 	 	in	to	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	now	.
 what 	 ever 	 	work	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	now	to	benefit	the	world	,	sink	 in 	 to 	 	that	,	get	a	full	taste	of	that	.
td	:	so	,	since	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	 th 	 is 	 	week	,	we	've	taken	 million 	 s 	 	of	 breath 	 s 	 	,	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	have	n't	 witness 	 ed 	 	any	course	 change 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	we	often	 mis 	 s 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	subtle	 change 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	develop	grand	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	what	happiness	might	look	like	for	us	,	but	that	,	if	we	pay	attention	,	we	can	see	that	there	are	little	 symbol 	 s 	 	of	happiness	in	every	breath	that	we	take	.
td	:	so	,	every	one	of	you	who	 ha 	 s 	 	come	here	is	so	 talent 	 ed 	 	,	and	you	have	so	much	to	 off 	 er 	 	to	the	world	,	i	think	it	would	be	a	good	note	to	conclude	on	then	to	just	take	a	moment	to	appreciate	how	fortunate	we	are	to	have	come	together	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	and	 ex 	 change 	 d 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	form	a	strong	 aspir 	 ation 	 	and	energy	 with 	 in 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	we	will	take	the	good	that	 ha 	 s 	 	come	from	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	the	 moment 	 um 	 	,	the	 posit 	 ivity 	 	,	and	we	will	spread	that	and	plant	it	in	all	of	the	 corner 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
