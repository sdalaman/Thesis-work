thank	you	so	much	.	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	to	be	here	among	the	 smart 	 est 	 	of	the	smart	.
i	'm	here	to	tell	you	a	few	 tale 	 s 	 	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
there	's	a	jewish	 say 	 ing 	 	that	i	love	.
what	is	 tru 	 er 	 	than	truth	?	answer	:	the	story	.
i	'm	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.	i	want	to	convey	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 tru 	 er 	 	than	truth	about	our	common	 human 	 ity 	 	.
all	 st 	 ories 	 	interest	me	,	and	some	haunt	me	 un 	 til 	 	i	end	up	writing	them	.
certain	 theme 	 s 	 	keep	coming	up	:	justice	,	 loyal 	 ty 	 	,	violence	,	death	,	 politic 	 al 	 	and	social	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 free 	 dom 	 	.
i	'm	aware	of	the	 myster 	 y 	 	around	us	,	so	i	write	about	 co 	 incidence 	 s 	 	,	 premonition 	 s 	 	,	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	 dream 	 s 	 	,	the	power	of	nature	,	magic	.
in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	i	have	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	few	 book 	 s 	 	,	but	i	have	lived	in	 anonym 	 ity 	 	 un 	 til 	 	february	of	2006	,	when	i	carried	the	olympic	flag	in	the	winter	olympics	in	italy	.
that	made	me	a	 celebr 	 ity 	 	.	now	people	 recogn 	 ize 	 	me	in	macy	's	,	and	my	 grand 	 children 	 	think	that	i	'm	cool	.
allow	me	to	tell	you	about	my	four	 minute 	 s 	 	of	fame	.
one	of	the	 organize 	 rs 	 	of	the	olympic	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	,	of	the	 open 	 ing 	 	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	that	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 select 	 ed 	 	to	be	one	of	the	flag	-	 bear 	 ers 	 	.
i	 re 	 plied 	 	that	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	case	of	 mistak 	 en 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	get	from	 be 	 ing 	 	an	athlete	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	was	n't	even	 s 	 ure 	 	that	i	could	go	around	the	 stad 	 ium 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	 walk 	 er 	 	.
i	was	told	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	no	 laugh 	 ing 	 	matter	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	be	the	first	time	that	 on 	 ly 	 	women	would	carry	the	olympic	flag	.
five	women	,	 represent 	 ing 	 	five	 continent 	 s 	 	,	and	three	olympic	gold	 med 	 al 	 	 winner 	 s 	 	.
my	first	question	was	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	what	was	i	going	to	wear	?
a	uniform	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	for	my	 measure 	 ments 	 	.
my	 measure 	 ments 	 	.
i	had	a	vision	of	 my 	 self 	 	in	a	 flu 	 ffy 	 	 ano 	 rak 	 	,	looking	like	the	michelin	man	.
by	the	middle	of	february	,	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	turin	,	where	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	 crowd 	 s 	 	 cheer 	 ed 	 	when	any	of	the	80	olympic	 team 	 s 	 	was	in	the	street	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 athlete 	 s 	 	had	 sacrifice 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	to	compete	in	the	 game 	 s 	 	.
they	all	 deserve 	 d 	 	to	win	,	but	there	's	the	element	of	luck	.
a	 s 	 peck 	 	of	snow	,	an	inch	of	ice	,	the	force	of	the	wind	,	can	determine	the	result	of	a	race	or	a	game	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	what	 matter 	 s 	 	most	--	more	than	training	or	luck	--	is	the	heart	.
 on 	 ly 	 	a	 fear 	 less 	 	and	 determine 	 d 	 	heart	will	get	the	gold	 med 	 al 	 	.
it	is	all	about	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
the	 street 	 s 	 	of	turin	 we 	 re 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	red	 post 	 ers 	 	 announc 	 ing 	 	the	slogan	of	the	olympics	.
 pass 	 ion 	 	 live 	 s 	 	here	.	is	n't	it	 al 	 ways 	 	true	?
heart	is	what	 drive 	 s 	 	us	and	 determine 	 s 	 	our	fate	.
that	is	what	i	need	for	my	 character 	 s 	 	in	my	 book 	 s 	 	:	a	passionate	heart	.
i	need	 maverick 	 s 	 	,	 dis 	 sidents 	 	,	 adventure 	 rs 	 	,	 out 	 sider 	 s 	 	and	 rebel 	 s 	 	,	who	ask	 question 	 s 	 	,	bend	the	 rule 	 s 	 	and	take	 risk 	 s 	 	.
people	like	all	of	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
nice	people	with	common	sense	do	not	make	 interest 	 ing 	 	 character 	 s 	 	.
they	 on 	 ly 	 	make	good	 form 	 er 	 	 spouse 	 s 	 	.
in	the	green	room	of	the	 stad 	 ium 	 	,	i	met	the	other	flag	 bear 	 ers 	 	:	three	 athlete 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 actress 	 es 	 	susan	sarandon	and	sophia	loren	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	two	women	with	passionate	 heart 	 s 	 	:	wangari	maathai	,	the	 no 	 bel 	 	 prize 	 winner 	 	from	kenya	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 plant 	 ed 	 	30	million	 tree 	 s 	 	.	and	by	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	,	the	weather	,	in	some	 place 	 s 	 	in	africa	,	and	of	course	the	economic	 condition 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 village 	 s 	 	.
and	somaly	mam	,	a	cambodian	activist	who	 fight 	 s 	 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	against	child	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	.
when	she	was	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	her	 grand 	 father 	 	 s 	 old 	 	her	to	a	brothel	.
she	told	us	of	little	 girl 	 s 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	by	men	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	young	virgin	will	cure	them	from	 aid 	 s 	 	.
and	of	 brothel 	 s 	 	where	children	are	 force 	 d 	 	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	five	,	15	 client 	 s 	 	per	day	,	and	if	they	rebel	,	they	are	 torture 	 d 	 	with	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
in	the	green	room	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	my	uniform	.
it	was	not	the	kind	of	 out 	 fit 	 	that	i	 normal 	 ly 	 	wear	,	but	it	was	far	from	the	michelin	man	suit	that	i	had	 anticip 	 ated 	 	.	not	bad	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	 refrige 	 rator 	 	.
but	so	did	most	of	the	flag	-	 bear 	 ers 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	sophia	loren	,	the	universal	symbol	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
sophia	is	over	70	and	she	 look 	 s 	 	great	.
she	's	sexy	,	 s 	 lim 	 	and	tall	,	with	a	deep	tan	.
now	,	how	can	you	have	a	deep	tan	and	have	no	 wrinkl 	 es 	 	?
i	do	n't	know	.
when	 ask 	 ed 	 	in	a	tv	interview	,	``	how	could	she	look	so	good	?	``
she	 re 	 plied 	 	,	``	 post 	 ure 	 	.	my	back	is	 al 	 ways 	 	straight	,	and	i	do	n't	make	old	people	's	 noise 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	there	you	have	some	free	 ad 	 vice 	 	from	one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	women	on	earth	.
no	 grunt 	 ing 	 	,	no	 cough 	 ing 	 	,	no	 wheez 	 ing 	 	,	no	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	no	 fart 	 ing 	 	.
well	,	she	did	n't	say	that	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
at	some	point	around	 mid 	 night 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 summon 	 ed 	 	to	the	 wing 	 s 	 	of	the	 stad 	 ium 	 	,	and	the	 loud 	 speaker 	 s 	 	 announce 	 d 	 	the	olympic	flag	,	and	the	music	 start 	 ed 	 	--	by	the	way	,	the	same	music	that	 start 	 s 	 	here	,	the	aida	march	.
sophia	loren	was	right	in	front	of	me	--	she	's	a	foot	 tall 	 er 	 	than	i	am	,	not	 count 	 ing 	 	the	 po 	 of 	 y 	 	hair	.
she	 walk 	 ed 	 	 elegant 	 ly 	 	,	like	a	giraffe	on	the	african	 savanna 	 h 	 	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	flag	on	her	shoulder	.	i	 jog 	 ged 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	--	on	my	 tiptoe 	 s 	 	--	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	flag	on	my	 extend 	 ed 	 	arm	,	so	that	my	head	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	under	the	damn	flag	.
all	the	 camera 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	of	course	,	on	sophia	.
that	was	fortunate	for	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	most	press	 photo 	 s 	 	i	appear	too	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	often	between	sophia	's	 leg 	 s 	 	.
a	place	where	most	men	would	love	to	be	.
the	best	four	 minute 	 s 	 	of	my	entire	life	 we 	 re 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	in	the	olympic	 stad 	 ium 	 	.
my	husband	is	 offend 	 ed 	 	when	i	say	 th 	 is 	 	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	have	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	him	that	what	we	do	in	private	 usual 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	less	than	four	 minute 	 s 	 	--	--	so	he	should	n't	take	it	 personal 	 ly 	 	.
i	have	all	the	press	 clip 	 ping 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	four	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	want	to	forget	them	when	old	age	 destroy 	 s 	 	my	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	carry	in	my	heart	 fore 	 ver 	 	the	key	word	of	the	olympics	--	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
so	here	's	a	tale	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
the	year	is	1998	,	the	place	is	a	 pri 	 son 	 	camp	for	tutsi	 refuge 	 es 	 	in	congo	.
by	the	way	,	80	percent	of	all	 refuge 	 es 	 	and	 dis 	 place 	 d 	 	people	in	the	world	are	women	and	 girl 	 s 	 	.
we	can	call	 th 	 is 	 	place	in	congo	a	death	camp	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	not	 kill 	 ed 	 	will	die	of	disease	or	 starv 	 ation 	 	.
the	 protagonist 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	story	are	a	young	woman	,	rose	mapendo	,	and	her	children	.
she	's	 pregn 	 ant 	 	and	a	widow	.
 soldier 	 s 	 	have	 force 	 d 	 	her	to	watch	 a 	 s 	 	her	husband	was	 torture 	 d 	 	and	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
 some 	 how 	 	she	 manage 	 s 	 	to	keep	her	seven	children	 al 	 ive 	 	,	and	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	she	 give 	 s 	 	birth	to	 pre 	 mature 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	.
two	 tin 	 y 	 	little	 boy 	 s 	 	.
she	 cut 	 s 	 	the	 umbilic 	 al 	 	cord	with	a	stick	,	and	ties	it	with	her	own	hair	.
she	 name 	 s 	 	the	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	after	the	camp	's	 command 	 ers 	 	to	gain	 the 	 ir 	 	favor	,	and	 feed 	 s 	 	them	with	black	tea	 be 	 cause 	 	her	milk	can	not	sustain	them	.
when	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	burst	in	her	cell	to	rape	her	 old 	 est 	 	daughter	,	she	 grab 	 s 	 	hold	of	her	and	 re 	 fuse 	 s 	 	to	let	go	,	even	when	they	hold	a	gun	to	her	head	.
 some 	 how 	 	,	the	family	 surviv 	 es 	 	for	16	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	then	,	by	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	luck	,	and	the	passionate	heart	of	a	young	american	man	,	sasha	chanoff	,	who	 manage 	 s 	 	to	put	her	in	a	u.s.	 rescu 	 e 	 	plane	,	rose	mapendo	and	her	nine	children	end	up	in	phoenix	,	arizona	,	where	they	're	now	living	and	 thriv 	 ing 	 	.
mapendo	,	in	swahili	,	 mean 	 s 	 	great	love	.
the	 protagonist 	 s 	 	of	my	 book 	 s 	 	are	strong	and	passionate	women	like	rose	mapendo	.
i	do	n't	make	them	up	.	there	's	no	need	for	that	.
i	look	around	and	i	see	them	 every 	 where 	 	.
i	have	 work 	 ed 	 	with	women	and	for	women	all	my	life	.
i	know	them	well	.
i	was	born	in	ancient	 time 	 s 	 	,	at	the	end	of	the	world	,	in	a	 patriarch 	 al 	 	catholic	and	 conserv 	 ative 	 	family	.
no	wonder	that	by	age	five	i	was	a	 rag 	 ing 	 	feminist	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	term	had	not	 reach 	 ed 	 	chile	yet	,	so	 no 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	what	the	heck	was	wrong	with	me	.
i	would	soon	find	out	that	there	was	a	high	price	to	pay	for	my	 free 	 dom 	 	,	and	for	 question 	 ing 	 	the	 patriarch 	 y 	 	.
but	i	was	happy	to	pay	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	for	every	blow	that	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	,	i	was	able	to	deliver	two	.
once	,	when	my	daughter	paula	was	in	her	twenties	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	that	 femin 	 ism 	 	was	 d 	 ated 	 	,	that	i	should	move	on	.
we	had	a	 memor 	 able 	 	fight	.	 femin 	 ism 	 	is	 d 	 ated 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	for	 privilege 	 d 	 	women	like	my	daughter	and	all	of	us	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	not	for	most	of	our	 sister 	 s 	 	in	the	rest	of	the	world	who	are	still	 force 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 pre 	 mature 	 	marriage	,	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	,	 force 	 d 	 	labor	--	they	have	children	that	they	do	n't	want	or	they	can	not	feed	.
they	have	no	control	over	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
they	have	no	education	and	no	 free 	 dom 	 	.
they	are	 rap 	 ed 	 	,	 beat 	 en 	 	up	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	with	 imp 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
for	most	western	young	women	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	feminist	is	an	insult	.
 femin 	 ism 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	sexy	,	but	let	me	assure	you	that	it	never	 stop 	 ped 	 	me	from	 flirt 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	have	seldom	 suffer 	 ed 	 	from	lack	of	men	.
 femin 	 ism 	 	is	not	dead	,	by	no	 mean 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.	if	you	do	n't	like	the	term	,	change	it	,	for	goddess	'	sake	.
call	it	aphrodite	,	or	venus	,	or	bimbo	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	;	the	name	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	understand	what	it	is	about	,	and	we	support	it	.
so	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	tale	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 ad 	 	one	.
the	place	is	a	small	women	's	clinic	in	a	village	in	bangladesh	.
the	year	is	2005	.
jenny	is	a	young	american	 dent 	 al 	 	 hygien 	 ist 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	to	the	clinic	 a 	 s 	 	a	volunteer	 dur 	 ing 	 	her	three	-	week	 vac 	 ation 	 	.
she	's	prepared	to	clean	 tee 	 th 	 	,	but	when	she	 get 	 s 	 	there	,	she	 find 	 s 	 	out	that	there	are	no	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	no	 dent 	 ists 	 	,	and	the	clinic	is	just	a	hut	full	of	flies	.
 out 	 side 	 	,	there	is	a	line	of	women	who	have	 wait 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	.
the	first	patient	is	in	 excruciat 	 ing 	 	pain	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 rot 	 ten 	 	 mola 	 rs 	 	.
jenny	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	solution	is	to	pull	out	the	bad	 tee 	 th 	 	.
she	's	not	 licens 	 ed 	 	for	that	;	she	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 d 	 one 	 	it	.
she	 risk 	 s 	 	a	lot	and	she	's	 terr 	 ified 	 	.
she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	have	the	proper	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	but	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	some	novocaine	.
jenny	 ha 	 s 	 	a	brave	and	passionate	heart	.
she	 murmur 	 s 	 	a	 pray 	 er 	 	and	she	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 head 	 	with	the	operation	.
at	the	end	,	the	 reliev 	 ed 	 	patient	 kiss 	 es 	 	her	 hand 	 s 	 	.
that	day	the	 hygien 	 ist 	 	 pull 	 s 	 	out	 man 	 y 	 	more	 tee 	 th 	 	.
the	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	when	she	 come 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	to	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	clinic	,	her	first	patient	is	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	her	with	her	husband	.
the	woman	's	face	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 water 	 mel 	 on 	 	.
it	is	so	swollen	that	you	ca	n't	even	see	the	 eye 	 s 	 	.
the	husband	,	 fur 	 ious 	 	,	 threaten 	 s 	 	to	kill	the	american	.
jenny	is	 horr 	 ified 	 	at	what	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	but	then	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	that	the	patient	's	condition	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	the	operation	.
the	day	before	,	her	husband	beat	her	up	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	not	home	in	time	to	 prep 	 are 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	for	him	.
 million 	 s 	 	of	women	live	like	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
they	are	the	 poor 	 est 	 	of	the	poor	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	women	do	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	world	's	labor	,	they	own	less	than	one	percent	of	the	world	's	 asset 	 s 	 	.
they	are	paid	less	than	men	for	the	same	work	if	they	're	paid	at	all	,	and	they	remain	 vulner 	 able 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	no	economic	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	and	they	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	 exploit 	 ation 	 	,	violence	and	abuse	.
it	is	a	fact	that	giving	women	education	,	work	,	the	ability	to	control	 the 	 ir 	 	own	income	,	inherit	and	own	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	 benefit 	 s 	 	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
if	a	woman	is	 empower 	 ed 	 	,	her	children	and	her	family	will	be	better	off	.
if	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	prosper	,	the	village	 prosper 	 s 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	so	 do 	 es 	 	the	whole	country	.
wangari	maathai	 go 	 es 	 	to	a	village	in	kenya	.
she	 talk 	 s 	 	with	the	women	and	 explain 	 s 	 	that	the	land	is	 bar 	 ren 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	cut	and	 s 	 old 	 	the	 tree 	 s 	 	.
she	 get 	 s 	 	the	women	to	plant	new	 tree 	 s 	 	and	water	them	,	drop	by	drop	.
in	a	matter	of	five	or	six	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	have	a	forest	,	the	 s 	 oil 	 	is	 enrich 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	village	is	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
the	 poor 	 est 	 	and	most	 back 	 ward 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	that	put	women	down	.
yet	 th 	 is 	 	obvious	truth	is	 ignor 	 ed 	 	by	 government 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	by	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
for	every	dollar	 give 	 n 	 	to	a	women	's	program	,	20	 dollar 	 s 	 	are	 give 	 n 	 	to	men	's	 program 	 s 	 	.
women	are	51	percent	of	 human 	 kind 	 	.
 empower 	 ing 	 	them	will	change	 every 	 thing 	 	--	more	than	technology	and	design	and	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
i	can	promise	you	that	women	 work 	 ing 	 	together	--	linked	,	 inform 	 ed 	 	and	educated	--	can	 br 	 ing 	 	peace	and	 prosper 	 ity 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 for 	 sake 	 n 	 	planet	.
in	any	war	 to 	 day 	 	,	most	of	the	 casual 	 ties 	 	are	 civil 	 ians 	 	,	 main 	 ly 	 	women	and	children	.	they	are	 col 	 lateral 	 	damage	.
men	run	the	world	,	and	look	at	the	mess	we	have	.
what	kind	of	world	do	we	want	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fundamental	question	that	most	of	us	are	 ask 	 ing 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	it	make	sense	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	world	order	?
we	want	a	world	where	life	is	 preserve 	 d 	 	and	the	quality	of	life	is	 enrich 	 ed 	 	for	 every 	 body 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	 privilege 	 d 	 	.
in	january	i	saw	an	exhibit	of	fernando	botero	's	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	at	the	uc	berkeley	library	.
no	museum	or	 gall 	 ery 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	new	york	 gall 	 ery 	 	that	 car 	 ries 	 	botero	's	work	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 da 	 red 	 	to	show	the	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	theme	is	the	abu	ghraib	 pri 	 son 	 	.
they	are	huge	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	torture	and	abuse	of	power	,	in	the	 volu 	 min 	 ous 	 	botero	style	.
i	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	out	of	my	mind	or	my	heart	.
what	i	fear	most	is	power	with	 imp 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
i	fear	abuse	of	power	,	and	the	power	to	abuse	.
in	our	species	,	the	alpha	 male 	 s 	 	define	 re 	 ality 	 	,	and	force	the	rest	of	the	pack	to	accept	that	 re 	 ality 	 	and	follow	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
the	 rule 	 s 	 	change	all	the	time	,	but	they	 al 	 ways 	 	benefit	them	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	 trick 	 le 	 	-	down	effect	,	which	 do 	 es 	 	not	work	in	 economic 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	.
abuse	 trick 	 les 	 	down	from	the	top	of	the	 lad 	 der 	 	to	the	bottom	.
women	and	children	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	poor	,	are	at	the	bottom	.
even	the	most	destitute	of	men	have	 some 	 one 	 	they	can	abuse	--	a	woman	or	a	child	.
i	'm	fed	up	with	the	power	that	a	few	exert	over	the	 man 	 y 	 	through	gender	,	income	,	race	,	and	class	.
i	think	that	the	time	is	 rip 	 e 	 	to	make	fundamental	 change 	 s 	 	in	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
but	for	real	change	,	we	need	 femin 	 ine 	 	energy	in	the	management	of	the	world	.
we	need	a	critical	number	of	women	in	 position 	 s 	 	of	power	,	and	we	need	to	nurture	the	 femin 	 ine 	 	energy	in	men	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	men	with	young	 mind 	 s 	 	,	of	course	.
old	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 hope 	 less 	 	;	we	have	to	wait	for	them	to	die	off	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	i	would	love	to	have	sophia	loren	's	long	 leg 	 s 	 	and	 legend 	 ary 	 	 breast 	 s 	 	.
but	 give 	 n 	 	a	choice	,	i	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	have	the	warrior	 heart 	 s 	 	of	wangari	maathai	,	somaly	mam	,	jenny	and	rose	mapendo	.
i	want	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	world	good	.
not	better	,	but	to	make	it	good	.
why	not	?	it	is	possible	.	look	around	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	all	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	,	energy	,	talent	and	technology	.
let	's	get	off	our	 fan 	 n 	 ies 	 	,	roll	up	our	 sleeve 	 s 	 	and	get	to	work	,	 passionate 	 ly 	 	,	in	creating	an	 al 	 most 	 	perfect	world	.
thank	you	.
