i	 s 	 pent 	 	the	best	part	of	last	year	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	 document 	 ary 	 	about	my	own	happiness	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	see	if	i	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	train	my	mind	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	way	,	like	i	can	train	my	body	,	so	i	can	end	up	with	an	 improv 	 ed 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 over 	 all 	 	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
then	 th 	 is 	 	january	,	my	mother	 di 	 ed 	 	,	and	 pur 	 suing 	 	a	film	like	that	just	 seem 	 ed 	 	the	last	thing	that	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
so	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	typical	,	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	 design 	 er 	 	fashion	,	after	 year 	 s 	 	worth	of	work	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	all	i	have	to	show	for	it	are	the	 title 	 s 	 	for	the	film	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	still	 d 	 one 	 	when	i	was	on	sabbatical	with	my	company	in	indonesia	.
we	can	see	the	first	part	here	was	designed	here	by	 pig 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	little	bit	too	 funk 	 y 	 	,	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	a	more	 femin 	 ine 	 	point	of	view	and	 employ 	 ed 	 	a	duck	who	did	it	in	a	much	more	fitting	way	--	fashion	.
my	studio	in	bali	was	 on 	 ly 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	away	from	a	monkey	forest	,	and	 monkey 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	of	all	 animal 	 s 	 	.
so	we	trained	them	to	be	able	to	do	three	 separat 	 e 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	to	lay	out	them	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
you	can	see	,	there	still	is	a	little	bit	of	a	 leg 	 ibility 	 	problem	there	.
the	serif	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	in	place	.
so	of	course	,	what	you	do	n't	do	 proper 	 ly 	 	 your 	 self 	 	is	never	 de 	 em 	 ed 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	us	 climb 	 ing 	 	onto	the	 tree 	 s 	 	and	 put 	 ting 	 	it	up	over	the	sayan	 val 	 ley 	 	in	indonesia	.
in	that	year	,	what	i	did	do	a	lot	was	look	at	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 survey 	 s 	 	,	looking	at	a	lot	of	data	on	 th 	 is 	 	subject	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	men	and	women	report	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 level 	 s 	 	of	happiness	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	 over 	 view 	 	of	all	the	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	.
that	climate	 play 	 s 	 	no	role	.
that	if	you	live	in	the	best	climate	,	in	san	diego	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	or	in	the	 shit 	 tiest 	 	climate	,	in	buffalo	,	new	york	,	you	are	going	to	be	just	 a 	 s 	 	happy	in	either	place	.
if	you	make	more	than	50,000	 buck 	 s 	 	a	year	in	the	u.s.	,	any	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	you	're	going	to	experience	will	have	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	influence	on	your	 over 	 all 	 	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
black	people	are	just	 a 	 s 	 	happy	 a 	 s 	 	white	people	are	.
if	you	're	old	or	young	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
if	you	're	 ug 	 ly 	 	or	if	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	good	-	looking	it	 make 	 s 	 	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
you	will	adapt	to	it	and	get	used	to	it	.
if	you	have	 manage 	 able 	 	health	 problem 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	matter	.
so	now	the	woman	on	the	right	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	much	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	than	the	guy	on	the	left	--	meaning	that	,	if	you	have	a	lot	of	 friend 	 s 	 	,	and	you	have	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 friend 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	make	a	lot	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	married	--	you	are	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	much	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	than	if	you	are	single	.
a	fellow	ted	speaker	,	jonathan	haidt	,	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	little	 analog 	 y 	 	between	the	conscious	and	the	 un 	 conscious 	 	mind	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	that	the	conscious	mind	is	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	rider	on	 th 	 is 	 	giant	elephant	,	the	 un 	 conscious 	 	.
and	the	rider	 think 	 s 	 	that	he	can	tell	the	elephant	what	to	do	,	but	the	elephant	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	his	own	 idea 	 s 	 	.
if	i	look	at	my	own	life	,	i	'm	born	in	1962	in	austria	.
if	i	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	born	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	the	big	 decision 	 s 	 	in	my	life	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	made	for	me	--	meaning	i	would	have	 stay 	 ed 	 	in	the	town	that	i	was	born	in	;	i	would	have	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 like 	 ly 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	same	profession	that	my	dad	did	;	and	i	would	have	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 like 	 ly 	 	married	a	woman	that	my	mom	had	 select 	 ed 	 	.
i	,	of	course	,	and	all	of	us	,	are	 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	charge	of	these	big	 decision 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
we	live	where	we	want	to	be	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	west	.
we	 be 	 come 	 	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
we	 choos 	 e 	 	our	own	profession	,	and	we	 choos 	 e 	 	our	own	 partner 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	surprising	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	let	our	 un 	 conscious 	 	influence	 t 	 hose 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	in	ways	that	we	are	not	 quit 	 e 	 	aware	of	.
if	you	look	at	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	and	you	see	that	the	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	george	,	when	he	 decide 	 s 	 	on	where	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	live	--	is	it	florida	or	north	dakota	?	--	he	 go 	 es 	 	and	 live 	 s 	 	in	georgia	.
and	if	you	look	at	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	dennis	,	when	he	 decide 	 s 	 	what	to	 be 	 come 	 	--	is	it	a	lawyer	,	or	 do 	 es 	 	he	want	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	doctor	or	a	teacher	?	--	best	chance	is	that	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 dent 	 ist 	 	.
and	if	paula	 decide 	 s 	 	should	she	marry	joe	or	jack	,	 some 	 how 	 	paul	 sound 	 s 	 	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	even	if	we	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	for	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	it	 remain 	 s 	 	 statistic 	 ally 	 	true	that	there	are	more	georges	living	in	georgia	and	there	are	more	dennises	 be 	 coming 	 	 dent 	 ists 	 	and	there	are	more	paulas	who	are	married	to	paul	than	 statistic 	 ally 	 	 vi 	 able 	 	.
now	i	,	of	course	,	thought	,	``	well	 th 	 is 	 	is	american	data	,	``	and	i	thought	,	``	well	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	americans	.
they	get	 influence 	 d 	 	by	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	're	not	aware	of	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.	``
then	,	of	course	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	my	mom	and	my	dad	--	karolina	and	karl	,	and	 grand 	 mom 	 	and	 grand 	 dad 	 	,	josefine	and	josef	.
so	i	am	looking	still	for	a	stephanie	.
i	'll	figure	 some 	 thing 	 	out	.
if	i	make	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	a	little	bit	more	personal	and	see	what	 make 	 s 	 	me	happy	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	answer	,	of	course	,	is	do	more	of	the	stuff	that	i	like	to	do	and	much	less	of	the	stuff	that	i	do	n't	like	to	do	--	for	which	it	would	be	 help 	 ful 	 	to	know	what	it	is	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	like	to	do	.
i	'm	a	big	list	maker	,	so	i	came	up	with	a	list	.
one	of	them	is	to	think	 with 	 out 	 	pressure	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	right	now	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 health 	 y 	 	 dead 	 line 	 	.
it	's	a	book	on	culture	,	and	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	culture	is	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 drift 	 ing 	 	around	.
 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	right	now	--	 travel 	 ing 	 	to	cannes	.
the	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	have	here	is	a	chair	that	came	out	of	the	year	in	bali	--	 clear 	 ly 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	local	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	and	culture	,	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	single	computer	screen	all	day	long	and	be	here	and	there	.
 quit 	 e 	 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	,	design	 project 	 s 	 	that	need	an	 in 	 credible 	 	amount	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	,	just	 bas 	 ically 	 	to	fight	 straight 	 forward 	 	 adapt 	 ation 	 	.
 be 	 ing 	 	close	to	the	content	--	that	's	the	content	 re 	 ally 	 	is	close	to	my	heart	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bus	,	or	vehicle	,	for	a	 char 	 ity 	 	,	for	an	ngo	that	 want 	 s 	 	to	double	the	education	budget	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	--	 care 	 fully 	 	designed	,	so	,	by	two	 inch 	 es 	 	,	it	still	 clear 	 s 	 	 high 	 way 	 	 over 	 pass 	 es 	 	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	end	 result 	 s 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	that	come	back	from	the	 print 	 er 	 	well	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	little	business	card	for	an	 anim 	 ation 	 	company	 call 	 ed 	 	sideshow	on	 lent 	 icular 	 	 foil 	 s 	 	.
 work 	 ing 	 	on	 project 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	visible	 impact 	 s 	 	,	like	a	book	for	a	 de 	 cease 	 d 	 	german	artist	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	widow	came	to	us	with	the	 requir 	 ement 	 	to	make	her	late	husband	famous	.
it	just	came	out	six	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	 tract 	 ion 	 	right	now	in	germany	.
and	i	think	that	his	widow	is	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	on	her	quest	.
and	 late 	 ly 	 	,	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 project 	 s 	 	where	i	know	about	50	percent	of	the	project	 techni 	 que 	 	-	wise	and	the	other	50	percent	would	be	new	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	it	's	an	 out 	 side 	 	 project 	 ion 	 	for	singapore	on	these	giant	 time 	 s 	 	square	-	like	 screen 	 s 	 	.
and	i	of	course	 k 	 new 	 	stuff	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	about	 typo 	 graphy 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	not	so	 success 	 fully 	 	.
but	i	did	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	know	all	that	much	about	 move 	 ment 	 	or	film	.
and	from	that	point	of	view	we	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 love 	 ly 	 	project	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	content	was	 ver 	 y 	 	close	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	``	 keep 	 ing 	 	a	 di 	 ary 	 	 support 	 s 	 	personal	 develop 	 ment 	 	``	--	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	a	 di 	 ary 	 	since	i	was	12	.
and	i	've	found	that	it	 influence 	 d 	 	my	life	and	work	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	way	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	part	of	one	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	 sentiment 	 s 	 	that	we	build	the	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	on	--	that	all	the	 sentiment 	 s 	 	 original 	 ly 	 	had	come	out	of	the	 di 	 ary 	 	.
thank	you	so	much	.
