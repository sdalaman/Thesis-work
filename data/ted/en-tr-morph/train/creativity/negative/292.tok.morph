 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	know	me	know	how	passionate	i	am	about	 open 	 ing 	 	the	space	 front 	 ier 	 	.
so	when	i	had	the	chance	to	give	the	world	's	expert	in	 gravit 	 y 	 	the	experience	of	zero	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	it	was	 in 	 credible 	 	.
and	i	want	to	tell	you	that	story	.
i	first	met	him	through	the	archon	x	prize	for	 genomic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 com 	 petition 	 	we	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	,	the	second	x	prize	,	for	the	first	team	to	sequence	100	human	 genome 	 s 	 	in	10	 day 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	genome	100	--	100	 individual 	 s 	 	we	're	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	that	.
craig	venter	 chair 	 s 	 	that	event	.
and	i	met	professor	 hawk 	 ing 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	his	dream	was	to	travel	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	ca	n't	take	you	there	,	but	i	can	take	you	 in 	 to 	 	 weight 	 lessness 	 	 in 	 to 	 	zero	-	g	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	on	the	spot	,	``	 absolute 	 ly 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
well	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	experience	zero	-	g	on	earth	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	with	 para 	 bolic 	 	flight	,	 weight 	 less 	 	flight	.
you	take	an	 air 	 plane 	 	,	you	fly	over	the	top	,	you	're	 weight 	 less 	 	for	25	 second 	 s 	 	.
come	back	down	,	you	weigh	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	.
you	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
you	can	get	eight	,	10	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 weight 	 lessness 	 	--	how	nasa	's	trained	 the 	 ir 	 	 astro 	 nauts 	 	for	so	long	.
we	set	out	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	took	us	11	 year 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 operation 	 al 	 	.
and	we	 announce 	 d 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	fly	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	.
we	had	one	government	 age 	 ncy 	 	and	one	company	 air 	 craft 	 	 oper 	 ator 	 	say	,	you	're	crazy	,	do	n't	do	that	,	you	're	going	kill	the	guy	.
and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	.
we	 work 	 ed 	 	hard	to	get	all	the	 per 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
and	six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	 s 	 at 	 	down	at	kennedy	space	center	.
we	had	a	press	 con 	 ference 	 	,	we	 announce 	 d 	 	our	intent	to	do	one	zero	-	g	parabola	,	give	him	25	 second 	 s 	 	of	zero	-	g	.
and	if	it	went	 re 	 ally 	 	well	,	we	might	do	three	 parabola 	 s 	 	.
well	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	why	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	up	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	for	me	,	was	 ver 	 y 	 	moving	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	life	on	earth	is	at	an	ever	-	increasing	risk	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	by	disaster	...
i	think	the	human	race	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	future	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
i	 there 	 fore 	 	want	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	public	interest	in	space	.	``
we	took	him	out	to	the	kennedy	space	center	,	up	 in 	 side 	 	the	nasa	vehicle	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	back	of	the	zero	-	g	 air 	 plane 	 	.
we	had	about	20	people	who	made	 don 	 ations 	 	--	we	raised	$	150,000	in	 don 	 ations 	 	for	children	's	 char 	 ities 	 	--	who	flew	with	us	.
a	few	tedsters	here	.
we	set	up	a	whole	er	.
we	had	four	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	two	 nurse 	 s 	 	on	board	the	 air 	 plane 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 monitor 	 ing 	 	his	po	2	of	his	blood	,	his	heart	rate	,	his	blood	pressure	.
we	had	 every 	 thing 	 	all	set	in	case	of	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	;	god	 know 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	want	to	hurt	 th 	 is 	 	world	-	 ren 	 owned 	 	expert	.
we	took	off	from	the	shuttle	 land 	 ing 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	,	where	the	shuttle	 take 	 s 	 	off	and	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	my	partner	byron	lichtenberg	and	i	 care 	 fully 	 	 suspend 	 ed 	 	him	 in 	 to 	 	zero	-	g	.
once	he	was	there	,	[	we	]	let	him	go	to	experience	what	 weight 	 lessness 	 	was	 tru 	 ly 	 	like	.
and	after	that	first	parabola	,	you	know	,	the	doc	 s 	 aid 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	is	great	.	he	was	 smil 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	go	.
so	we	did	a	second	parabola	.
and	a	third	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 float 	 ed 	 	an	apple	in	 hom 	 age 	 	to	 s 	 ir 	 	isaac	newton	 be 	 cause 	 	professor	 hawk 	 ing 	 	 hold 	 s 	 	the	same	chair	at	cambridge	that	isaac	newton	did	.
and	we	did	a	fourth	,	and	a	fifth	and	a	sixth	.
and	a	 seven 	 th 	 	and	an	eighth	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	man	 do 	 es 	 	not	look	like	a	65	-	year	-	old	wheelchair	-	bound	man	.
he	was	so	happy	.
we	are	living	on	a	precious	jewel	,	and	it	's	 dur 	 ing 	 	our	 life 	 time 	 	that	we	're	moving	off	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	join	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	epic	adventure	.
thank	you	so	much	.
