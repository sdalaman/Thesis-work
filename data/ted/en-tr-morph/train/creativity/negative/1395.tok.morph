i	like	to	build	stuff	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 like 	 d 	 	to	build	stuff	.
my	team	at	biosense	,	a	 start 	 up 	 	i	co	-	 found 	 ed 	 	with	my	doctor	and	engineer	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	built	a	technology	 call 	 ed 	 	touchb	,	which	can	do	blood	 test 	 ing 	 	of	hemoglobin	 with 	 out 	 	 prick 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 needle 	 s 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	 democrat 	 ize 	 	health	care	.
they	're	two	big	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	what	they	mean	.
in	fact	,	in	2009	,	i	was	even	more	 clue 	 less 	 	.
i	had	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	idea	what	was	going	to	happen	next	.
i	was	,	in	fact	,	 bus 	 y 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	finish	off	my	ph.d.	,	which	was	in	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 related 	 	area	of	how	people	interact	,	 contributor 	 s 	 	interact	,	how	 article 	 s 	 	are	 form 	 ed 	 	in	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	quality	 emerge 	 s 	 	from	the	system	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	building	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	copenhagen	wheel	,	which	is	just	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	electric	bike	at	a	lab	at	mit	 call 	 ed 	 	senseable	city	lab	.
i	was	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	that	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	mumbai	,	my	house	,	back	for	a	 vac 	 ation 	 	.
so	at	that	time	i	was	 plan 	 ning 	 	a	road	trip	.
i	 visit 	 ed 	 	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	parol	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	north	of	mumbai	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	place	where	my	friend	,	abhishek	sen	was	 intern 	 ing 	 	.
he	's	a	doctor	there	.
and	that	's	his	actual	photograph	.
so	abhishek	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	me	wait	.
he	was	out	there	in	parol	 deliver 	 ing 	 	a	baby	.
i	was	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	and	when	he	did	emerge	,	he	was	ashen	-	 face 	 d 	 	.
he	told	me	that	there	had	 be 	 en 	 	two	 death 	 s 	 	;	the	mother	and	child	both	had	 di 	 ed 	 	.
the	reason	,	he	told	me	,	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	post	 part 	 um 	 	 hemorrh 	 age 	 	.
he	 explain 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	severe	internal	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	.
what	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 shock 	 ing 	 	for	me	was	that	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	due	to	 un 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	 ane 	 mia 	 	.
now	 ane 	 mia 	 	--	i	'm	an	engineer	,	but	even	i	 k 	 new 	 	--	that	 ane 	 mia 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	fatal	.
it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	cure	is	known	.
i	mean	,	 fol 	 ic 	 	acid	,	iron	 table 	 ts 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	,	 afford 	 able 	 	 cure 	 s 	 	exist	to	control	 ane 	 mia 	 	.
so	why	was	 th 	 is 	 	woman	 dy 	 ing 	 	?
it	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 prevent 	 able 	 	.
five	 minute 	 s 	 	away	from	there	,	i	had	the	center	,	the	medical	center	,	which	was	 distribut 	 ing 	 	 subsidize 	 d 	 	iron	 table 	 ts 	 	.
so	the	whole	nature	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 complete 	 ly 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	me	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	there	had	to	be	a	way	to	prevent	 th 	 is 	 	.
my	mom	is	a	 pediatric 	 ian 	 	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	.
she	told	me	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	would	 typical 	 ly 	 	test	for	 ane 	 mia 	 	.
take	a	blood	 s 	 ample 	 	and	run	it	through	a	machine	 call 	 ed 	 	a	coulter	counter	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	$	10,000	machine	which	was	 avail 	 able 	 	in	mumbai	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	here	or	in	any	part	,	i	guess	,	in	europe	and	most	cities	in	the	world	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 avail 	 able 	 	in	parol	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	that	woman	who	was	 oper 	 ating 	 	the	machine	,	the	technician	,	is	not	 avail 	 able 	 	in	parol	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	--	i	love	to	fix	 thing 	 s 	 	.	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	fix	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	got	a	friend	of	mine	,	an	engineer	,	and	three	other	 doctor 	 s 	 	--	abhishek	 join 	 ed 	 	the	team	--	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
by	the	time	i	step	down	from	here	there	will	be	10	people	who	have	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	through	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 prevent 	 able 	 	problem	.
now	let	me	take	you	back	to	parol	.
you	saw	the	woman	there	,	the	nurse	.
in	india	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	an	asha	 work 	 er 	 	.
it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	village	health	 work 	 er 	 	,	a	 mat 	 ron 	 	.
she	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	center	of	the	health	care	system	.
public	health	care	 run 	 s 	 	on	the	asha	 work 	 er 	 	,	not	the	doctor	.
now	we	 k 	 new 	 	we	had	to	design	 some 	 thing 	 	which	she	could	use	.
we	 k 	 new 	 	it	had	to	be	these	three	 thing 	 s 	 	that	the	machine	had	to	have	.
we	 k 	 new 	 	it	had	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	which	had	no	 needle 	 s 	 	,	no	 prick 	 ing 	 	,	so	it	would	have	 adopt 	 ion 	 	,	it	would	not	have	medical	waste	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
it	had	to	be	simple	 en 	 ough 	 	for	that	woman	asha	 work 	 er 	 	to	use	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	it	had	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	which	she	could	carry	in	her	kit	.
she	 go 	 es 	 	village	to	village	 do 	 ing 	 	 screen 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
we	thought	we	could	build	it	,	so	we	built	it	.
but	,	but	it	did	n't	work	.
so	we	built	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	32	 time 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	tell	you	that	last	year	we	did	build	it	--	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	i	have	it	here	in	my	 pur 	 s 	 e 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	machine	 call 	 ed 	 	the	touchb	quik	.
what	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 measure 	 s 	 	my	hemoglobin	,	oxygen	and	 puls 	 e 	 	rate	.
i	put	it	on	my	finger	,	 s 	 witch 	 	it	on	,	and	in	about	20	 second 	 s 	 	it	'll	give	me	,	on	the	little	screen	here	,	a	value	of	hemoglobin	,	oxygen	 s 	 atur 	 ation 	 	and	heart	rate	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	help	asha	 work 	 ers 	 	 diagnos 	 e 	 	 ane 	 mia 	 	at	the	point	of	care	.
i	'll	explain	a	little	bit	about	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
you	might	have	 s 	 een 	 	a	little	light	 in 	 side 	 	of	it	.
in	fact	,	there	are	three	 light 	 s 	 	in	there	,	three	 wave 	 length 	 s 	 	of	light	.
and	we	 essential 	 ly 	 	pass	light	right	through	the	tissue	,	and	from	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	much	of	it	is	 transmit 	 ted 	 	,	how	much	of	it	is	 scatter 	 ed 	 	and	how	much	of	it	is	 absorb 	 ed 	 	,	we	can	figure	out	how	much	hemoglobin	is	there	in	the	blood	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	based	on	a	principle	 call 	 ed 	 	 photo 	 ple 	 thy 	 sm 	 ography 	 	.
we	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	what	else	non	-	invasive	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	able	to	crack	in	the	future	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	which	my	intern	here	,	pratesh	,	built	is	a	mobile	application	,	which	can	now	 s 	 end 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	data	 any 	 where 	 	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	go	.
there	's	a	bunch	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	stuff	which	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
i	would	love	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	more	about	it	.
but	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	is	that	the	map	 be 	 hind 	 	of	me	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	map	of	 ane 	 mia 	 	.
it	's	the	death	rates	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 ane 	 mia 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	.
you	'll	notice	,	of	course	,	that	there	are	hot	 spot 	 s 	 	--	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	africa	.
my	business	plan	is	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
i	'm	just	going	to	sell	these	to	every	clinic	in	the	world	.
that	's	a	simple	bottom	-	line	business	plan	.
and	by	the	time	i	'm	 d 	 one 	 	,	in	2020	,	when	the	who	 publish 	 es 	 	the	data	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	the	map	of	 ane 	 mia 	 	.
thank	you	.
