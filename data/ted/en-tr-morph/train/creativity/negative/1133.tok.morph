i	thought	i	would	talk	a	little	bit	about	how	nature	 make 	 s 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
i	 br 	 ought 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	me	an	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	shell	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	shell	is	a	 bio 	 composite 	 	material	that	's	98	percent	by	mass	 calc 	 ium 	 	 carbon 	 ate 	 	and	two	percent	by	mass	protein	.
yet	,	it	's	3,000	 time 	 s 	 	 tough 	 er 	 	than	 it 	 s 	 	 geo 	 logical 	 	 counter 	 part 	 	.
and	a	lot	of	people	might	use	 structure 	 s 	 	like	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	 shell 	 s 	 	,	like	chalk	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	how	nature	 make 	 s 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	and	there	's	a	lot	of	sequence	to	how	they	do	 s 	 uch 	 	an	exquisite	job	.
part	of	it	is	that	these	 material 	 s 	 	are	 macro 	 scopic 	 	in	structure	,	but	they	're	 form 	 ed 	 	at	the	 nano 	 scale 	 	.
they	're	 form 	 ed 	 	at	the	 nano 	 scale 	 	,	and	they	use	 protein 	 s 	 	that	are	 cod 	 ed 	 	by	the	genetic	level	that	allow	them	to	build	these	 re 	 ally 	 	exquisite	 structure 	 s 	 	.
so	 some 	 thing 	 	i	think	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	is	what	if	you	could	give	life	to	non	-	living	 structure 	 s 	 	,	like	 batt 	 eries 	 	and	like	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	?
what	if	they	had	some	of	the	same	 cap 	 abilities 	 	that	an	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	shell	did	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	build	 re 	 ally 	 	exquisite	 structure 	 s 	 	at	room	temperature	and	room	pressure	,	using	non	-	toxic	 chemical 	 s 	 	and	 add 	 ing 	 	no	toxic	 material 	 s 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	environment	?
so	that	's	the	vision	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
and	so	what	if	you	could	grow	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	in	a	 pe 	 tri 	 	dish	?
or	,	what	if	you	could	give	genetic	information	to	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	so	that	it	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	better	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	time	,	and	do	so	in	an	 environment 	 ally 	 	friendly	way	?
and	so	,	going	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	shell	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	nano	-	 structure 	 d 	 	,	one	thing	that	's	 fasci 	 nating 	 	,	is	when	a	male	and	a	female	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	get	together	,	they	pass	on	the	genetic	information	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	to	build	an	exquisite	material	.
here	's	how	to	do	it	at	room	temperature	and	pressure	,	using	non	-	toxic	 material 	 s 	 	.	``
same	with	 di 	 atom 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 show 	 n 	 	right	here	,	which	are	 glass 	 eous 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
every	time	the	 di 	 atom 	 s 	 	replicate	,	they	give	the	genetic	information	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	here	's	how	to	build	glass	in	the	ocean	that	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	nano	-	 structure 	 d 	 	.
and	you	can	do	it	the	same	,	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
so	what	if	you	could	do	the	same	thing	with	a	solar	cell	or	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	?
i	like	to	say	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 bio 	 material 	 	is	my	four	year	-	old	.
but	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	ever	had	,	or	 know 	 s 	 	,	small	children	 know 	 s 	 	they	're	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	complex	 organism 	 s 	 	.
and	so	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	them	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	they	do	n't	want	to	do	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	.
so	when	we	think	about	future	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	of	using	bacteria	and	virus	,	simple	 organism 	 s 	 	.
can	you	 con 	 vince 	 	them	to	work	with	a	new	 tool 	 box 	 	,	so	that	they	can	build	a	structure	that	will	be	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	?
 al 	 so 	 	,	when	we	think	about	future	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	we	start	with	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	earth	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	it	took	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	to	have	life	on	earth	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	they	 be 	 came 	 	multi	-	cellular	,	they	could	replicate	,	they	could	use	 photo 	 synthesis 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	source	.
but	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	about	500	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	cambrian	 geo 	 logic 	 	time	period	--	that	 organism 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	 start 	 ed 	 	making	hard	 material 	 s 	 	.
before	that	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	soft	,	 flu 	 ffy 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	that	there	was	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 calc 	 ium 	 	and	iron	and	silicon	in	the	environment	,	and	 organism 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	make	hard	 material 	 s 	 	.
and	so	that	's	what	i	would	like	be	able	to	do	--	 con 	 vince 	 	biology	to	work	with	the	rest	of	the	 period 	 ic 	 	table	.
now	if	you	look	at	biology	,	there	's	 man 	 y 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	like	dna	and	 anti 	 bodies 	 	and	 protein 	 s 	 	and	 ribosome 	 s 	 	that	you	've	heard	about	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	nano	-	 structure 	 d 	 	.
so	nature	 al 	 ready 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	 re 	 ally 	 	exquisite	 structure 	 s 	 	on	the	 nano 	 scale 	 	.
what	if	we	could	harness	them	and	 con 	 vince 	 	them	to	not	be	an	 anti 	 body 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	hiv	?
but	what	if	we	could	 con 	 vince 	 	them	to	build	a	solar	cell	for	us	?
so	here	are	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	:	these	are	some	natural	 shell 	 s 	 	.
there	are	natural	 bio 	 logical 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
the	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	shell	here	--	and	if	you	fracture	it	,	you	can	look	at	the	fact	that	it	's	nano	-	 structure 	 d 	 	.
there	's	 di 	 atom 	 s 	 	made	out	of	sio	2	,	and	they	're	 magnet 	 o 	 tactic 	 	bacteria	that	make	small	,	single	-	domain	 magnet 	 s 	 	used	for	 navig 	 ation 	 	.
what	all	these	have	in	common	is	these	 material 	 s 	 	are	 structure 	 d 	 	at	the	 nano 	 scale 	 	,	and	they	have	a	dna	sequence	that	 code 	 s 	 	for	a	protein	sequence	that	 give 	 s 	 	them	the	 blue 	 print 	 	to	be	able	to	build	these	 re 	 ally 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
now	,	going	back	to	the	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	shell	,	the	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	shell	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	these	 protein 	 s 	 	.
these	 protein 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 negative 	 ly 	 	charged	.
and	they	can	pull	 calc 	 ium 	 	out	of	the	environment	,	put	down	a	layer	of	 calc 	 ium 	 	and	then	 carbon 	 ate 	 	,	 calc 	 ium 	 	and	 carbon 	 ate 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	chemical	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	to	build	the	structure	.
here	's	the	dna	sequence	,	here	's	the	protein	sequence	in	order	to	do	it	.	``
and	so	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	idea	is	,	what	if	you	could	take	any	material	that	you	 want 	 ed 	 	,	or	any	element	on	the	 period 	 ic 	 	table	,	and	find	 it 	 s 	 	 correspond 	 ing 	 	dna	sequence	,	then	code	it	for	a	 correspond 	 ing 	 	protein	sequence	to	build	a	structure	,	but	not	build	an	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	shell	--	build	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	through	nature	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	never	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	work	with	yet	.
and	so	here	's	the	 period 	 ic 	 	table	.
and	i	 absolute 	 ly 	 	love	the	 period 	 ic 	 	table	.
every	year	for	the	 in 	 coming 	 	 fresh 	 man 	 	class	at	mit	,	i	have	a	 period 	 ic 	 	table	made	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	welcome	to	mit	.	now	you	're	in	your	element	.	``
and	you	flip	it	over	,	and	it	's	the	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	with	the	ph	at	which	they	have	different	 charge 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	give	 th 	 is 	 	out	to	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.
and	i	know	it	 say 	 s 	 	mit	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	caltech	,	but	i	have	a	couple	extra	if	people	want	it	.
and	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	fortunate	to	have	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	visit	my	lab	 th 	 is 	 	year	on	his	visit	to	mit	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	him	a	 period 	 ic 	 	table	.
so	i	 stay 	 ed 	 	up	at	night	,	and	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	my	husband	,	``	how	do	i	give	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	a	 period 	 ic 	 	table	?
what	if	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	'	oh	,	i	 al 	 ready 	 	have	one	,	'	or	,	'	i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 memor 	 ized 	 	it	'	?	``
and	so	he	came	to	visit	my	lab	and	 look 	 ed 	 	around	--	it	was	a	great	visit	.
and	then	 after 	 ward 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 s 	 ir 	 	,	i	want	to	give	you	the	 period 	 ic 	 	table	in	case	you	're	ever	in	a	bind	and	need	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	weight	.	``
and	i	thought	 mole 	 cular 	 	weight	 sound 	 ed 	 	much	less	 nerd 	 y 	 	than	 mola 	 r 	 	mass	.
and	so	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	thank	you	.	i	'll	look	at	it	 period 	 ically 	 	.	``
and	 lat 	 er 	 	in	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	that	he	 g 	 ave 	 	on	clean	energy	,	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	it	out	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	people	at	mit	,	they	give	out	 period 	 ic 	 	 table 	 s 	 	.	``
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	i	did	n't	tell	you	is	that	about	500	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 organism 	 s 	 	 start 	 er 	 	making	 material 	 s 	 	,	but	it	took	them	about	50	million	 year 	 s 	 	to	get	good	at	it	.
it	took	them	about	50	million	 year 	 s 	 	to	learn	how	to	perfect	how	to	make	that	 ab 	 al 	 one 	 	shell	.
and	that	's	a	hard	sell	to	a	graduate	student	.
``	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	great	project	--	50	million	 year 	 s 	 	.	``
and	so	we	had	to	develop	a	way	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	more	 rapid 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	we	use	a	virus	that	's	a	non	-	toxic	virus	 call 	 ed 	 	m	13	 bacter 	 io 	 phage 	 	that	's	job	is	to	infect	bacteria	.
well	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	simple	dna	structure	that	you	can	go	in	and	cut	and	paste	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	dna	 sequence 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	by	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	it	 allow 	 s 	 	the	virus	to	express	random	protein	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	easy	 bio 	 technology 	 	.
and	you	could	 bas 	 ically 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	a	billion	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	so	you	can	go	in	and	have	a	billion	different	viruses	that	are	all	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	,	but	they	differ	from	each	other	based	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 tip 	 s 	 	,	on	one	sequence	that	 code 	 s 	 	for	one	protein	.
now	if	you	take	all	billion	viruses	,	and	you	can	put	them	in	one	drop	of	liquid	,	you	can	force	them	to	interact	with	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	on	the	 period 	 ic 	 	table	.
and	through	a	process	of	 s 	 election 	 	evolution	,	you	can	pull	one	out	of	a	billion	that	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	'd	like	it	to	do	,	like	grow	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	or	grow	a	solar	cell	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	viruses	ca	n't	replicate	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	;	they	need	a	host	.
once	you	find	that	one	out	of	a	billion	,	you	infect	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	bacteria	,	and	you	make	 million 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	of	copies	of	that	 part 	 icular 	 	sequence	.
and	so	the	other	thing	that	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	about	biology	is	that	biology	 give 	 s 	 	you	 re 	 ally 	 	exquisite	 structure 	 s 	 	with	nice	link	 scale 	 s 	 	.
and	these	viruses	are	long	and	 skin 	 ny 	 	,	and	we	can	get	them	to	express	the	ability	to	grow	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 semi 	 conductor 	 s 	 	or	 material 	 s 	 	for	 batt 	 eries 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	high	-	powered	 batt 	 ery 	 	that	we	grew	in	my	lab	.
we	engineered	a	virus	to	pick	up	carbon	 nano 	 tube 	 s 	 	.
so	one	part	of	the	virus	 grab 	 s 	 	a	carbon	 nano 	 tube 	 	.
the	other	part	of	the	virus	 ha 	 s 	 	a	sequence	that	can	grow	an	 electro 	 de 	 	material	for	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
and	then	it	 wire 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	to	the	current	 collect 	 or 	 	.
and	so	through	a	process	of	 s 	 election 	 	evolution	,	we	went	from	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	have	a	virus	that	made	a	crummy	 batt 	 ery 	 	to	a	virus	that	made	a	good	 batt 	 ery 	 	to	a	virus	that	made	a	record	-	 break 	 ing 	 	,	high	-	powered	 batt 	 ery 	 	that	's	all	made	at	room	temperature	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	at	the	bench	top	.
and	that	 batt 	 ery 	 	went	to	the	white	house	for	a	press	 con 	 ference 	 	.
i	 br 	 ought 	 	it	here	.
you	can	see	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	--	that	's	 light 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	led	.
now	if	we	could	scale	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	it	to	run	your	prius	,	which	is	my	dream	--	to	be	able	to	drive	a	virus	-	powered	car	.
but	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	you	can	pull	one	out	of	a	billion	.
you	can	make	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 ampl 	 ification 	 s 	 	to	it	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	you	make	an	 ampl 	 ification 	 	in	the	lab	,	and	then	you	get	it	to	self	-	assemble	 in 	 to 	 	a	structure	like	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
we	're	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	with	 cata 	 lysis 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 photo 	 catalytic 	 	 split 	 ting 	 	of	water	.
and	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	is	engineer	a	virus	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	take	dye	-	 absorb 	 ing 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	line	them	up	on	the	surface	of	the	virus	so	it	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	antenna	,	and	you	get	an	energy	transfer	 a 	 cross 	 	the	virus	.
and	then	we	give	it	a	second	gene	to	grow	an	 in 	 organ 	 ic 	 	material	that	can	be	used	to	split	water	 in 	 to 	 	oxygen	and	hydrogen	that	can	be	used	for	clean	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 br 	 ought 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	with	me	of	that	 to 	 day 	 	.
my	 student 	 s 	 	 promise 	 d 	 	me	it	would	work	.
these	are	virus	-	 assemble 	 d 	 	 nano 	 wire 	 s 	 	.
when	you	shine	light	on	them	,	you	can	see	them	 bubb 	 ling 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	oxygen	 bubble 	 s 	 	come	out	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	by	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	 gene 	 s 	 	,	you	can	control	 multi 	 ple 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	improve	your	 de 	 vice 	 	performance	.
the	last	 ex 	 ample 	 	are	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	engineer	viruses	to	pick	up	carbon	 nano 	 tube 	 s 	 	and	then	grow	 titan 	 ium 	 	 di 	 oxide 	 	around	them	--	and	use	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 electron 	 s 	 	through	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	what	we	've	found	is	through	genetic	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	the	efficiencies	of	these	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	to	record	 number 	 s 	 	for	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	dye	-	sensitized	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 br 	 ought 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	that	you	can	play	around	with	 out 	 side 	 	 after 	 ward 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	virus	-	based	solar	cell	.
through	evolution	and	 s 	 election 	 	,	we	took	it	from	an	eight	percent	efficiency	solar	cell	to	an	11	percent	efficiency	solar	cell	.
so	i	hope	that	i	've	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	you	that	there	's	a	lot	of	great	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	be	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	how	nature	 make 	 s 	 	 material 	 s 	 	--	and	taking	it	the	next	step	to	see	if	you	can	force	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	you	can	take	advantage	of	how	nature	 make 	 s 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	that	nature	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	yet	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	making	.
thank	you	.
