so	,	i	'm	in	chile	,	in	the	atacama	desert	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	hotel	lobby	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	that	i	can	get	a	wi	-	fi	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	and	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	picture	up	on	my	screen	,	and	a	woman	 come 	 s 	 	up	 be 	 hind 	 	me	.
she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	,	that	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
what	is	it	?	is	that	jackson	pollock	?	``
and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	can	be	a	little	too	honest	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	it	's	--	it	's	penguin	shit	.	``
and	,	you	know	,	``	excuse	me	!	``
and	i	could	sense	that	she	thought	i	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	 syn 	 ec 	 do 	 ch 	 ically 	 	.
so	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	 re 	 ally 	 	--	it	's	penguin	shit	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	falkland	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	taking	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	gentoo	penguin	.	and	she	was	still	 skeptic 	 al 	 	.
so	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	before	that	,	i	 download 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	scientific	paper	about	 calcul 	 ations 	 	on	 av 	 ian 	 	 defec 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	you	can	model	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	poiseuille	flow	,	``	and	you	can	learn	an	awful	lot	about	the	physics	of	the	 av 	 ian 	 	 rect 	 um 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 technical 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	not	a	 rect 	 um 	 	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	cloaca	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	she	 stop 	 s 	 	me	,	and	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	who	are	you	?
wha	--	what	do	you	do	?	``
and	i	was	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	have	any	way	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	i	do	.
and	so	,	in	some	sense	,	 th 	 is 	 	talk	 to 	 day 	 	is	my	answer	to	that	.
it	's	a	 s 	 election 	 	of	a	random	bunch	of	the	stuff	that	i	do	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	for	me	to	make	sense	of	it	,	so	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	that	you	can	.
it	's	the	kind	of	thing	that	i	 s 	 it 	 	up	late	at	night	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	--	often	at	four	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	some	people	are	 af 	 raid 	 	of	what	i	do	.
some	people	think	i	am	the	nerd	tony	soprano	,	and	in	 respons 	 e 	 	,	i	have	 order 	 ed 	 	a	 bullet 	 proof 	 	pocket	 protect 	 or 	 	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	what	these	people	think	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	speak	norsk	.
but	i	'm	not	 think 	 ing 	 	``	 mon 	 ster 	 et 	 	``	is	a	good	thing	.
i	do	n't	know	,	you	know	?
so	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	love	to	do	is	travel	around	the	world	and	look	at	 archaeo 	 logical 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 archaeo 	 logy 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	past	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	and	see	where	they	 succeed 	 ed 	 	and	where	they	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
use	science	to	,	you	know	,	work	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	well	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	what	 we 	 re 	 	they	 think 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	i	was	in	easter	 is 	 land 	 	,	which	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	place	,	and	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	place	,	 be 	 cause 	 	no	matter	where	you	go	in	easter	 is 	 land 	 	,	you	're	 s 	 truck 	 	by	these	 statue 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	moai	.
the	place	is	64	square	 mile 	 s 	 	.
they	made	,	so	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	tell	,	900	of	them	.
why	on	earth	?	and	if	you	have	n't	read	jared	diamond	's	book	,	``	collapse	,	``	i	 total 	 ly 	 	recommend	that	you	do	.
he	's	got	a	great	chapter	about	it	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	these	people	 commit 	 ted 	 	 eco 	 logical 	 	 su 	 icide 	 	in	order	to	make	more	of	these	.
and	 some 	 where 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	line	,	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	know	!	let	's	cut	down	the	last	tree	and	commit	 su 	 icide 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	need	more	 ident 	 ical 	 	 statue 	 s 	 	.	``
and	,	one	thing	that	is	n't	a	 myster 	 y 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	was	when	i	grew	up	--	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	was	a	little	kid	,	i	'd	 s 	 een 	 	these	 picture 	 s 	 	--	and	i	thought	,	``	well	,	why	that	look	on	the	face	?
why	that	brow	?	``	i	mean	,	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	thing	.
where	did	they	get	that	inspiration	?
and	then	i	met	 yo 	 yo 	 	,	who	is	the	native	rapa	nui	-	an	guide	,	and	if	you	look	at	 yo 	 yo 	 	's	face	,	you	kind	of	figure	out	where	they	got	it	.
there	's	 man 	 y 	 	 myster 	 ies 	 	,	these	 statue 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	,	how	did	they	make	them	,	how	did	they	transport	them	?
 th 	 is 	 	woman	in	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	is	jo	anne	van	tilberg	.
she	's	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 archaeo 	 logist 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	easter	 is 	 land 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	 statue 	 s 	 	for	20	-	some	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	 record 	 s 	 	of	every	single	statue	.
the	one	on	the	page	here	is	the	same	that	's	up	there	.
one	 interest 	 ing 	 	problem	is	the	stone	is	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	used	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	smooth	.
in	fact	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 statue 	 s 	 	,	when	you	 excav 	 ate 	 	them	,	the	 back 	 s 	 	are	 total 	 ly 	 	smooth	--	 al 	 most 	 	glass	smooth	.
but	after	1,000	 year 	 s 	 	out	in	the	weather	,	they	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
jo	anne	and	i	have	just	 embark 	 ed 	 	on	a	project	to	 digit 	 ize 	 	them	all	,	and	we	're	going	to	do	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	 re 	 s 	 	 digit 	 ization 	 	,	first	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	way	of	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	them	.
second	,	we	have	these	 idea 	 s 	 	about	how	you	can	 algorithm 	 ically 	 	,	then	,	learn	a	few	of	the	 myster 	 ies 	 	about	them	.
how	long	have	they	 be 	 en 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	what	 position 	 s 	 	?
and	 may 	 be 	 	,	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	get	at	some	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	of	what	 caus 	 ed 	 	them	to	be	the	way	they	are	.
while	i	was	in	easter	 is 	 land 	 	,	 com 	 et 	 	mcnaught	was	there	 al 	 so 	 	,	so	you	get	a	gratuitous	picture	of	a	moai	with	a	 com 	 et 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	have	an	 archaeo 	 logical 	 	project	going	on	in	egypt	.
``	going	on	``	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	strong	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	all	of	the	 per 	 mission 	 s 	 	to	get	 every 	 thing 	 	all	set	,	to	get	it	going	.
so	,	i	'll	talk	about	it	at	a	future	ted	.
but	there	's	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	egypt	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	i	do	is	i	invent	stuff	.
in	fact	,	i	design	nuclear	 reactor 	 s 	 	.
not	a	joke	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 convention 	 al 	 	nuclear	fuel	cycle	.
the	red	line	is	what	is	 d 	 one 	 	in	most	nuclear	 reactor 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	open	fuel	cycle	.
the	white	lines	are	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	an	advance	fuel	cycle	,	where	you	 re 	 process 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	normal	way	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	.
it	's	got	the	huge	advantage	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	create	carbon	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 dis 	 advantage 	 s 	 	:	each	one	of	these	 step 	 s 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	expensive	,	it	's	 potential 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	and	they	have	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	that	the	step	can	not	be	 perform 	 ed 	 	in	 any 	 one 	 	's	 back 	 yard 	 	,	which	is	a	problem	.
so	,	our	reactor	 eliminate 	 s 	 	these	 step 	 s 	 	,	which	,	if	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	it	work	,	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	thing	.
now	,	it	's	kind	of	nuts	to	work	on	a	new	nuclear	reactor	.
there	's	--	no	reactor	's	 be 	 en 	 	even	built	to	an	old	design	,	much	less	a	new	one	,	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	for	25	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	kind	of	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	risk	,	but	 potential 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	return	thing	that	we	do	.
changing	 in 	 to 	 	a	 total 	 ly 	 	different	field	,	we	do	a	lot	of	stuff	in	solid	state	physics	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	an	area	 call 	 ed 	 	 meta 	 material 	 s 	 	.
a	 meta 	 material 	 	is	an	artificial	material	,	which	 manipul 	 ates 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	in	a	way	that	you	could	n't	 other 	 wise 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	here	is	an	 in 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	cloak	.
it	may	not	seem	that	,	but	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	 micro 	 wave 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	would	view	it	.
 ray 	 s 	 	of	light	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 micro 	 wave 	 	light	--	come	in	,	and	they	just	squish	around	the	cell	,	and	they	come	back	the	other	side	.
now	,	you	could	do	that	with	 mirror 	 s 	 	from	one	angle	.
the	cool	thing	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	from	all	 angle 	 s 	 	.
 meta 	 material 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	--	a	,	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	on	 micro 	 wave 	 	,	and	b	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	all	that	well	yet	.
but	 meta 	 material 	 s 	 	are	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	field	.
it	's	--	you	know	,	 to 	 day 	 	i	'd	like	to	say	it	's	a	zero	billion	dollar	business	,	but	,	in	fact	,	it	's	negative	.
but	some	day	,	some	day	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	going	to	work	.
we	do	a	lot	of	work	in	 bio 	 medical 	 	 field 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	a	major	medical	 found 	 ation 	 	to	develop	 in 	 expensive 	 	ways	of	 diagnos 	 ing 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	,	they	say	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	the	 window 	 s 	 	of	the	soul	--	 turn 	 s 	 	out	they	're	a	window	to	a	whole	lot	more	stuff	.
and	these	happen	to	be	my	 eye 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	.
now	,	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
while	i	was	at	 micro 	 soft 	 	,	i	took	a	 leav 	 e 	 	of	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	and	went	to	a	chef	school	in	france	.
i	used	to	work	,	 al 	 so 	 	while	at	 micro 	 soft 	 	,	at	a	 lead 	 ing 	 	restaurant	in	seattle	,	so	i	do	a	lot	of	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	on	a	team	that	won	the	world	 champion 	 ship 	 	of	barbecue	.
but	barbecue	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	one	of	these	cult	 food 	 s 	 	like	chili	,	or	bouillabaisse	.
 vari 	 ous 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	will	have	a	cult	food	that	people	get	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	--	there	's	tremendous	 tradition 	 s 	 	,	there	's	secrecy	.
and	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	use	a	 ver 	 y 	 	scientific	approach	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 lat 	 est 	 	 cook 	 er 	 	,	and	if	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	the	nuclear	reactor	,	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	.
but	if	you	get	to	play	with	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 knob 	 s 	 	and	 dial 	 s 	 	--	and	of	course	,	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 controll 	 er 	 	over	there	 do 	 es 	 	it	all	on	 soft 	 ware 	 	--	you	can	make	some	 terr 	 ific 	 	 rib 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	high	-	speed	 cent 	 rifuge 	 	.
you	should	all	have	one	in	your	kitchen	,	 be 	 side 	 	your	turbochef	.
 th 	 is 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	food	to	a	force	about	50,000	 time 	 s 	 	that	of	normal	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	and	oh	boy	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	 clar 	 ify 	 	chicken	stock	.
you	would	not	 believ 	 e 	 	it	!
i	perform	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 ghoul 	 ish 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	on	food	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	calibrate	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	model	so	that	one	can	predict	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	internal	 cook 	 ing 	 	 time 	 s 	 	are	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	a	,	it	's	 use 	 ful 	 	,	and	for	a	geek	like	me	,	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.
 theor 	 y 	 	is	red	,	black	is	experiment	.
so	,	i	'm	either	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	 fak 	 ing 	 	it	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	model	 seem 	 s 	 	to	work	.
so	,	 an 	 other 	 	random	thing	i	do	is	the	search	for	 extra 	 terrestrial 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	or	seti	.
and	you	may	be	familiar	with	the	movie	``	contact	,	``	which	sort	of	 popular 	 ized 	 	that	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	are	real	people	who	go	out	and	search	for	 extra 	 terrestrial 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	scientific	way	.
in	fact	,	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	movie	is	based	on	a	real	character	,	a	real	person	.
so	,	the	jodie	foster	character	here	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	woman	,	jill	tarter	,	and	jill	 ha 	 s 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	her	life	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	know	,	a	lot	of	people	risk	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	brief	act	of	 hero 	 ism 	 	,	which	is	kind	of	cool	,	but	jill	 ha 	 s 	 	what	i	call	 s 	 low 	 	 hero 	 ism 	 	.
she	is	 risk 	 ing 	 	her	professional	life	on	 some 	 thing 	 	that	her	own	 calcul 	 ations 	 	show	may	not	work	for	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	--	may	not	ever	.
so	,	i	like	to	support	people	that	are	 risk 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
after	the	movie	came	out	,	of	course	,	there	was	a	lot	of	interest	in	seti	.
my	 kid 	 s 	 	saw	the	movie	,	and	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	they	came	to	me	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	,	dad	,	so	--	so	--	that	character	--	that	's	jill	,	right	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	--	 absolute 	 ly 	 	.	``
``	and	that	other	person	,	that	's	 some 	 one 	 	--	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	that	 creep 	 y 	 	rich	guy	in	the	movie	?
is	that	you	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	it	's	just	a	movie	!	come	on	.	``
so	,	the	seti	institute	,	with	a	little	bit	of	help	from	me	,	and	a	lot	of	help	from	paul	allen	and	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	other	people	,	is	building	a	 dedicate 	 d 	 	radio	 tele 	 scope 	 	in	hat	creek	,	california	,	so	they	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	seti	work	.
now	,	i	travel	a	lot	,	and	i	change	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	a	lot	,	and	the	one	person	who	 al 	 ways 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 update 	 d 	 	on	all	my	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	and	 page 	 rs 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	is	jill	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	want	to	 mis 	 s 	 	``	the	call	.	``
i	mean	,	can	you	imagine	?	e.t	.	's	 phon 	 ing 	 	home	,	and	i	'm	not	,	like	,	there	?	you	know	,	 horr 	 ible 	 	!
so	,	i	do	a	lot	of	work	on	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	known	to	tedsters	 a 	 s 	 	the	guy	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	with	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
and	i	resemble	that	remark	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	a	different	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	 find 	 ing 	 	of	them	.
now	,	to	find	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	you	 hik 	 e 	 	around	in	 horr 	 ible 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	looking	for	a	dinosaur	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	dumb	,	but	that	's	what	it	is	.
it	's	 horr 	 ible 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 where 	 ver 	 	you	have	nice	weather	,	 plant 	 s 	 	grow	,	and	you	do	n't	get	any	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	see	any	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	 al 	 ways 	 	find	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	in	 desert 	 s 	 	or	 bad 	 land 	 s 	 	,	 area 	 s 	 	that	have	 ver 	 y 	 	little	plant	growth	and	have	flash	 flood 	 s 	 	in	the	spring	.
you	know	,	 ski 	 ers 	 	pray	for	snow	?
 paleonto 	 logists 	 	pray	for	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	you	 hik 	 e 	 	around	and	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	after	you	dig	them	up	,	they	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	 hik 	 e 	 	around	,	you	see	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	found	,	so	look	at	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	here	.
you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 bent 	 on 	 ite 	 	clay	,	which	is	--	sort	of	 s 	 well 	 s 	 	up	and	 expand 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	some	stuff	 po 	 king 	 	out	.	so	,	you	look	at	that	,	and	you	look	up	close	,	and	you	say	,	``	well	,	gee	,	that	's	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	what	are	all	of	these	 piece 	 s 	 	?	``
well	,	if	you	look	 close 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	from	the	shape	,	that	these	are	skull	 fragment 	 s 	 	.
and	then	when	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	say	,	``	that	's	a	tooth	.
it	's	a	big	tooth	.	``
it	's	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	banana	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	big	 s 	 er 	 ration 	 	on	the	edge	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	tyrannosaurus	 r 	 ex 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	in	the	ground	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	's	like	to	find	a	tyrannosaurus	 r 	 ex 	 	,	which	i	was	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	do	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	tyrannosaurus	 r 	 ex 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	in	my	living	room	.
not	the	same	one	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cast	,	which	i	had	 b 	 ought 	 	,	and	then	,	after	 buy 	 ing 	 	the	cast	,	i	found	my	own	,	and	i	do	n't	have	room	for	two	.
you	know	.
so	,	the	thing	that	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	for	me	about	 find 	 ing 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	is	that	it	is	both	an	intellectual	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 construct 	 	the	environment	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	can	inform	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	science	in	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	ways	.
the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	led	to	the	 real 	 ization 	 	that	there	's	a	problem	with	 a 	 steroid 	 	impact	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	may	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	one	day	 s 	 ave 	 	the	planet	.
 stud 	 y 	 	of	the	ancient	climate	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	mesozoic	,	when	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	lived	,	had	much	 high 	 er 	 	co	2	than	 to 	 day 	 	,	was	much	 warm 	 er 	 	than	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	is	one	of	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	proof	 point 	 s 	 	for	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	co	2	on	climate	.
but	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 intellectual 	 ly 	 	and	 scientific 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	than	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	i	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	get	to	 hik 	 e 	 	around	in	the	 bad 	 land 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	most	dinosaur	research	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 paper 	 s 	 	:	``	a	 py 	 go 	 style 	 	from	a	non	-	 av 	 ian 	 	 ther 	 o 	 pod 	 	.	``
it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 grip 	 ping 	 	 a 	 s 	 	dinosaur	 s 	 ex 	 	,	so	we	're	not	going	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	it	further	.
now	,	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	big	on	 photograph 	 y 	 	.
i	travel	all	over	the	world	taking	 picture 	 s 	 	--	some	of	them	good	,	most	of	them	not	.
these	 day 	 s 	 	,	bits	are	cheap	.	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	you	've	got	to	 s 	 pend 	 	more	time	 sort 	 ing 	 	through	them	.
here	's	a	picture	i	took	in	the	falkland	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	of	king	 penguin 	 s 	 	on	a	beach	.
here	's	a	picture	i	took	in	alaska	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	of	orcas	.
i	'd	gone	up	to	photograph	orcas	,	and	we	had	 look 	 ed 	 	for	a	week	,	and	we	had	n't	 s 	 een 	 	a	damn	orca	.
and	the	last	day	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	,	the	orcas	come	,	they	're	right	by	the	boat	.	it	's	fantastic	.
and	i	get	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 picture 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
then	,	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	start	 get 	 ting 	 	some	 picture 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	to	a	human	audience	,	i	need	to	explain	that	if	 pent 	 house 	 	magazine	had	a	marine	mammal	 ed 	 ition 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	the	 center 	 fold 	 	.
it	's	true	.
so	,	there	's	more	and	more	activity	near	the	boat	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	 some 	 body 	 	 shout 	 s 	 	,	``	what	's	that	in	the	water	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	think	that	's	what	you	call	a	free	 will 	 y 	 	.	``
there	's	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	learn	from	 watch 	 ing 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
the	first	thing	you	learn	is	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 hand 	 s 	 	.
they	do	n't	have	them	.
i	think	paul	simon	is	in	the	audience	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	--	he	may	not	 real 	 ize 	 	it	,	but	he	wrote	a	song	all	about	whale	 s 	 ex 	 	,	``	slip	-	slidin	'	away	.	``
that	's	kind	of	what	it	's	like	.
the	other	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	whale	 s 	 ex 	 	:	they	curl	 the 	 ir 	 	 to 	 es 	 	too	.
so	--	where	do	you	go	 put 	 ting 	 	all	of	these	disparate	 piece 	 s 	 	together	?
you	know	,	there	's	a	tremendous	amount	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	in	 find 	 ing 	 	a	great	thing	,	 pass 	 ion 	 	in	life	,	and	 focus 	 ing 	 	all	your	energy	on	it	,	and	i	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	that	.
i	just	--	you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	'll	focus	 pass 	 ion 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	,	but	then	there	will	be	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	and	then	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	for	a	long	time	i	 f 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	``	well	,	gee	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	ought	to	 buck 	 le 	 	down	.	``
and	you	know	,	when	i	was	at	 micro 	 soft 	 	,	that	was	so	 en 	 gross 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	whole	industry	was	 expand 	 ing 	 	so	much	,	that	it	did	tend	to	crowd	out	most	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	in	my	life	.
but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	ought	to	do	is	not	fight	 be 	 ing 	 	who	i	am	,	but	embrace	it	.
and	say	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	know	,	i	--	 th 	 is 	 	whole	talk	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	mile	wide	and	an	inch	deep	,	but	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 work 	 s 	 	for	me	.	``
and	 regard 	 less 	 	of	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	nuclear	 reactor 	 s 	 	or	 meta 	 material 	 s 	 	or	whale	 s 	 ex 	 	,	the	common	--	or	 low 	 est 	 	common	 denomi 	 nator 	 	--	is	me	.
that	's	it	,	thank	you	.
