 every 	 one 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	think	of	your	 big 	 gest 	 	personal	goal	.
for	real	--	you	can	take	a	second	.	you	've	got	to	feel	 th 	 is 	 	to	learn	it	.
take	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	and	think	of	your	personal	 big 	 gest 	 	goal	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
imagine	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	right	now	that	you	're	going	to	do	it	.
imagine	 tell 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	that	you	meet	 to 	 day 	 	what	you	're	going	to	do	.
imagine	 the 	 ir 	 	 congratula 	 tions 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	high	image	of	you	.
 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	feel	good	to	say	it	out	loud	?
do	n't	you	feel	one	step	 close 	 r 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	like	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	part	of	your	 ident 	 ity 	 	?
well	,	bad	news	:	you	should	have	 ke 	 pt 	 	your	mouth	shut	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	good	 feel 	 ing 	 	now	will	make	you	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	do	it	.
 repeat 	 ed 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 test 	 s 	 	have	proven	that	 tell 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	your	goal	 make 	 s 	 	it	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	happen	.
any	time	you	have	a	goal	,	there	are	some	 step 	 s 	 	that	need	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	some	work	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	in	order	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	it	.
 ideal 	 ly 	 	,	you	would	not	be	satisfied	 un 	 til 	 	you	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	the	work	.
but	when	you	tell	 some 	 one 	 	your	goal	and	they	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	it	,	 psycho 	 logists 	 	have	found	that	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	social	 re 	 ality 	 	.	``
the	mind	is	kind	of	 trick 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	then	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	felt	that	satisfaction	,	you	're	less	 motiv 	 ated 	 	to	do	the	actual	hard	work	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	against	the	 convention 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	that	we	should	tell	our	 friend 	 s 	 	our	 goal 	 s 	 	,	right	--	so	they	hold	us	to	it	.
so	,	let	's	look	at	the	proof	.
1926	,	kurt	lewin	,	founder	of	social	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	``	 substitut 	 ion 	 	.	``
1933	,	vera	mahler	found	,	when	it	was	 acknowledg 	 ed 	 	by	 other 	 s 	 	,	it	felt	real	in	the	mind	.
1982	,	peter	gollwitzer	wrote	a	whole	book	about	 th 	 is 	 	and	in	2009	,	he	did	some	new	 test 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	163	people	 a 	 cross 	 	four	 separat 	 e 	 	 test 	 s 	 	--	 every 	 one 	 	wrote	down	 the 	 ir 	 	personal	goal	.
then	half	of	them	 announce 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	goal	to	the	room	,	and	half	did	n't	.
then	 every 	 one 	 	was	 give 	 n 	 	45	 minute 	 s 	 	of	work	that	would	 direct 	 ly 	 	lead	them	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	goal	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	told	that	they	could	stop	at	any	time	.
now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 ke 	 pt 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mouth 	 s 	 	shut	 work 	 ed 	 	the	entire	45	 minute 	 s 	 	,	on	average	,	and	when	 ask 	 ed 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	that	they	felt	that	they	had	a	long	way	to	go	still	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	goal	.
but	 t 	 hose 	 	who	had	 announce 	 d 	 	it	quit	after	 on 	 ly 	 	33	 minute 	 s 	 	,	on	average	,	and	when	 ask 	 ed 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	that	they	felt	much	 close 	 r 	 	to	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	goal	.
so	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	,	what	can	we	do	?
well	,	you	could	resist	the	 tempt 	 ation 	 	to	announce	your	goal	.
you	can	delay	the	 grat 	 ification 	 	that	the	social	 acknowledg 	 ement 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	understand	that	your	mind	 mistak 	 es 	 	the	 talk 	 ing 	 	for	the	 do 	 ing 	 	.
but	if	you	do	need	to	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	can	state	it	in	a	way	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	no	satisfaction	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	run	 th 	 is 	 	marathon	,	so	i	need	to	train	five	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	and	kick	my	ass	if	i	do	n't	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	``
so	audience	,	next	time	you	're	 tempt 	 ed 	 	to	tell	 some 	 one 	 	your	goal	,	what	will	you	say	?
 exact 	 ly 	 	,	well	 d 	 one 	 	.
