once	 up 	 on 	 	a	time	,	at	the	age	of	24	,	i	was	a	student	at	st.	john	's	medical	college	in	bangalore	.
i	was	a	guest	student	 dur 	 ing 	 	one	month	of	a	public	health	course	.
and	that	 change 	 d 	 	my	 mind 	 set 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
the	course	was	good	,	but	it	was	not	the	course	content	in	 it 	 self 	 	that	 change 	 d 	 	the	 mind 	 set 	 	.
it	was	the	brutal	 real 	 ization 	 	,	the	first	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	that	the	indian	 student 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	better	than	me	.
you	see	,	i	was	a	 stud 	 y 	 	nerd	.
i	 love 	 d 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	from	a	young	age	.
and	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	sweden	.
i	used	to	be	in	the	upper	quarter	of	all	 course 	 s 	 	i	 attend 	 ed 	 	.
but	in	st.	john	's	,	i	was	in	the	lower	quarter	.
and	the	fact	was	that	indian	 student 	 s 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	than	we	did	in	sweden	.
they	read	the	 text 	 book 	 	twice	,	or	three	 time 	 s 	 	or	four	 time 	 s 	 	.
in	sweden	we	read	it	once	and	then	we	went	 party 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	,	to	me	,	that	personal	experience	was	the	first	time	in	my	life	that	the	 mind 	 set 	 	i	grew	up	with	was	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	western	world	will	not	 continu 	 e 	 	to	dominate	the	world	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
and	i	think	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	the	same	sort	of	personal	experience	.
it	's	that	 real 	 ization 	 	of	 some 	 one 	 	you	meet	that	 re 	 ally 	 	made	you	change	your	 idea 	 s 	 	about	the	world	.
it	's	not	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	it	funny	.
and	i	will	now	,	here	,	 on 	 stage 	 	,	try	to	predict	when	that	will	happen	--	that	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	will	regain	 it 	 s 	 	 domin 	 ant 	 	position	 a 	 s 	 	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	part	of	the	world	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	used	to	be	,	over	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	will	do	that	by	 try 	 ing 	 	to	predict	 precise 	 ly 	 	at	what	year	the	average	income	per	person	in	india	,	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	will	reach	that	of	the	west	.
and	i	do	n't	mean	the	whole	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	to	grow	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	india	to	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	u.k.	--	that	's	a	piece	of	cake	,	with	one	billion	people	.
but	i	want	to	see	when	will	the	average	pay	,	the	money	for	each	person	,	per	month	,	in	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	,	when	will	that	have	 reach 	 ed 	 	that	of	u.k.	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	?
but	i	will	start	with	a	 historic 	 al 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	.
and	you	can	see	my	map	if	i	get	it	up	here	.	you	know	?
i	will	start	at	1858	.
1858	was	a	year	of	great	 techno 	 logical 	 	 advance 	 ment 	 	in	the	west	.
that	was	the	year	when	 que 	 en 	 	victoria	was	able	,	for	the	first	time	,	to	communicate	with	 p 	 resident 	 	buchanan	,	through	the	transatlantic	telegraphic	cable	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	to	``	twitter	``	 transatlantic 	 ally 	 	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	,	through	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	google	and	 inter 	 net 	 	,	to	find	the	text	of	the	 tele 	 gram 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	back	from	 p 	 resident 	 	buchanan	to	 que 	 en 	 	victoria	.
and	it	 end 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	 th 	 is 	 	 tele 	 graph 	 	is	a	fantastic	instrument	to	diffuse	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	 liber 	 ty 	 	and	law	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	.	``
 t 	 hose 	 	are	nice	 word 	 s 	 	.	but	i	got	sort	of	 cur 	 ious 	 	of	what	he	 me 	 ant 	 	with	 liber 	 ty 	 	,	and	 liber 	 ty 	 	for	whom	.
and	we	will	think	about	that	when	we	look	at	the	 wide 	 r 	 	picture	of	the	world	in	1858	.
 be 	 cause 	 	1858	was	 al 	 so 	 	 water 	 shed 	 	year	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
1858	was	the	year	when	the	 courage 	 ous 	 	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 	against	the	foreign	occupation	of	india	was	 defeat 	 ed 	 	by	the	british	 force 	 s 	 	.
and	india	was	up	to	89	 year 	 s 	 	more	of	foreign	 domin 	 ation 	 	.
1858	in	 chin 	 a 	 	was	the	 vict 	 ory 	 	in	the	 op 	 ium 	 	war	by	the	british	 force 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 me 	 ant 	 	that	 foreign 	 ers 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 s 	 aid 	 	in	the	 treat 	 y 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	trade	 free 	 ly 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
it	 me 	 ant 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	with	 op 	 ium 	 	for	chinese	 good 	 s 	 	.
and	1858	in	japan	was	the	year	when	japan	had	to	sign	the	harris	 treat 	 y 	 	and	accept	trade	on	 favor 	 able 	 	condition	for	the	u.s	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	 t 	 hose 	 	black	 ship 	 s 	 	there	,	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	tokyo	harbor	over	the	last	year	.
but	,	japan	,	in	contrast	to	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 maintain 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	national	 sovereign 	 ty 	 	.
and	let	's	see	how	much	 differ 	 ence 	 	that	can	make	.
and	i	will	do	that	by	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	these	 bubble 	 s 	 	back	to	a	gapminder	graph	here	,	where	you	can	see	each	bubble	is	a	country	.
the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	bubble	here	is	the	population	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	axis	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	used	to	have	income	per	person	in	 compar 	 able 	 	dollar	.
and	on	that	axis	i	have	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	,	the	health	of	people	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	an	 innov 	 ation 	 	here	.
i	have	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	laser	beam	 in 	 to 	 	an	 eco 	 logical 	 	,	 recycl 	 able 	 	version	here	,	in	green	india	.
and	we	will	see	,	you	know	.
look	here	,	1858	,	india	was	here	,	 chin 	 a 	 	was	here	,	japan	was	there	,	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	was	 rich 	 er 	 	over	there	.
and	i	will	start	the	world	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
india	was	not	 al 	 ways 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	level	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	if	we	go	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 historic 	 al 	 	record	,	there	was	a	time	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	the	income	per	person	in	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	was	even	above	that	of	europe	.
but	1850	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	foreign	 domin 	 ation 	 	,	and	india	had	 be 	 en 	 	de	-	 industrial 	 ized 	 	.
and	you	can	see	that	the	 count 	 ries 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	growing	 the 	 ir 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	was	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	by	the	end	of	the	century	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	and	japan	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	catch	up	.
india	was	 try 	 ing 	 	down	here	.
can	you	see	how	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	move	there	?
but	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	natural	 sovereign 	 ty 	 	was	good	for	japan	.
and	japan	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	move	up	there	.
and	it	's	the	new	century	now	.	health	is	 get 	 ting 	 	better	,	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	,	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
but	 care 	 ful 	 	now	--	we	are	 approach 	 ing 	 	the	first	world	war	.
and	the	first	world	war	,	you	know	,	we	'll	see	a	lot	of	 death 	 s 	 	and	 economic 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	here	.
 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	is	going	down	.
and	now	 come 	 s 	 	the	spanish	flu	 al 	 so 	 	.
and	then	after	the	first	world	war	,	they	 continu 	 e 	 	up	.
still	under	foreign	 domin 	 ation 	 	,	and	 with 	 out 	 	 sovereign 	 ty 	 	,	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	are	down	in	the	corner	.
not	much	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
they	have	grown	 the 	 ir 	 	population	but	not	much	more	.
in	the	1930	's	now	,	you	can	see	that	japan	is	going	to	a	period	of	war	,	with	lower	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	.
and	the	second	world	war	was	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	event	,	 al 	 so 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	for	japan	.
but	they	did	 re 	 cover 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	fast	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
and	we	are	moving	 in 	 to 	 	the	new	world	.
in	1947	india	 final 	 ly 	 	 gain 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	.
and	they	could	raise	the	indian	flag	and	 be 	 come 	 	a	sovereign	nation	,	but	in	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 difficult 	 ies 	 	down	there	.
in	1949	we	saw	the	emergence	of	the	modern	 chin 	 a 	 	in	a	way	which	 surprise 	 d 	 	the	world	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	after	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	?
you	can	see	that	the	health	 start 	 ed 	 	to	improve	.
children	 start 	 ed 	 	to	go	to	school	.
health	 service 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 provide 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	great	leap	forward	,	when	 chin 	 a 	 	fell	down	.
it	was	central	 plan 	 ning 	 	by	mao	tse	tung	.
 chin 	 a 	 	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.	then	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	nevermore	,	stupid	central	 plan 	 ning 	 	.	``
but	they	went	up	here	,	and	india	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	follow	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 catch 	 ing 	 	up	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
and	both	 count 	 ries 	 	had	the	better	health	,	but	still	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	we	came	to	1978	,	and	mao	tse	tung	 di 	 ed 	 	,	and	a	new	guy	 turn 	 ed 	 	up	from	the	left	.
and	it	was	deng	xiaoping	coming	out	here	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	if	a	cat	is	white	or	black	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	 catch 	 es 	 	 mic 	 e 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	 catch 	 ing 	 	 mic 	 e 	 	is	what	the	two	 cat 	 s 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
and	you	can	see	the	two	 cat 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	here	,	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	,	 want 	 ing 	 	to	catch	the	 mic 	 es 	 	over	there	,	you	know	.
and	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	not	 on 	 ly 	 	for	health	and	education	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	grow	 the 	 ir 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	the	market	 reform 	 er 	 	was	 success 	 ful 	 	there	.
in	'92	india	 follow 	 s 	 	with	a	market	reform	.
and	they	go	 quit 	 e 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	together	,	and	you	can	see	that	the	 similar 	 ity 	 	with	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	are	 great 	 er 	 	than	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	with	them	.
and	here	they	march	on	.	and	will	they	catch	up	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	big	question	 to 	 day 	 	.
there	they	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
now	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	that	the	--	the	 average 	 s 	 	there	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	average	of	 chin 	 a 	 	.
if	i	would	split	 chin 	 a 	 	,	look	here	,	shanghai	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 catch 	 ed 	 	up	.
shanghai	is	 al 	 ready 	 	there	.
and	it	's	 health 	 ier 	 	than	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
but	on	the	other	hand	,	guizhou	,	one	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 in 	 land 	 	 pro 	 vince 	 s 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	,	is	there	.
and	if	i	split	guizhou	 in 	 to 	 	urban	and	 r 	 ural 	 	,	the	 r 	 ural 	 	part	of	guizhou	 go 	 es 	 	down	there	.
you	see	 th 	 is 	 	enormous	 in 	 equ 	 ity 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	fast	economic	growth	.
and	if	i	would	 al 	 so 	 	look	at	india	,	you	have	 an 	 other 	 	type	of	 in 	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	india	.
the	 geo 	 graphical 	 	,	macro	-	 geo 	 graphical 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	not	so	big	.
uttar	pradesh	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	the	 state 	 s 	 	here	,	is	 poor 	 er 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lower	health	than	the	rest	of	india	.
kerala	is	 fly 	 ing 	 	on	top	there	,	 match 	 ing 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	health	,	but	not	in	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	here	,	maharashtra	,	with	mumbai	,	is	 for 	 ging 	 	forward	.
now	in	india	,	the	big	 in 	 equ 	 ities 	 	are	 with 	 in 	 	the	state	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	between	the	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	not	a	bad	thing	,	in	 it 	 self 	 	.
if	you	have	a	lot	 in 	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	macro	-	 geo 	 graphical 	 	 in 	 equ 	 ities 	 	can	be	more	difficult	in	the	long	term	to	deal	with	,	than	if	it	is	in	the	same	area	where	you	have	a	growth	center	 relat 	 ively 	 	close	to	where	poor	people	are	living	.
no	,	there	is	one	more	 in 	 equ 	 ity 	 	.	look	there	,	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
oh	,	they	broke	my	frame	.
washington	,	d.c.	went	out	here	.
my	 friend 	 s 	 	at	gapminder	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	show	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	a	new	 lead 	 er 	 	in	washington	who	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	the	health	system	.
and	i	can	understand	him	,	 be 	 cause 	 	washington	,	d.c	.
is	so	rich	over	there	but	they	are	not	 a 	 s 	 	 health 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	kerala	.
it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
i	can	see	a	business	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	kerala	,	 help 	 ing 	 	fix	the	health	system	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
now	here	we	have	the	whole	world	.	you	have	the	legend	down	there	.
and	when	you	see	the	two	giant	 cat 	 s 	 	here	,	 push 	 ing 	 	forward	,	you	see	that	in	between	them	and	 a 	 head 	 	of	them	,	is	the	whole	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	of	the	world	,	which	thomas	friedman	so	 correct 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	flat	world	.	``
you	can	see	that	in	health	and	education	,	a	large	part	of	the	world	population	is	 put 	 ting 	 	forward	,	but	in	africa	,	and	other	 part 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	guizhou	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	there	is	still	people	with	low	health	and	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
we	have	an	enormous	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	in	the	world	.
but	most	of	the	world	in	the	middle	are	 push 	 ing 	 	 forward 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
now	,	back	to	my	 project 	 ions 	 	.
when	will	it	catch	up	?	i	have	to	go	back	to	 ver 	 y 	 	 convention 	 al 	 	graph	.
i	will	show	income	per	person	on	 th 	 is 	 	axis	 in 	 stead 	 	,	poor	down	here	,	rich	up	there	.
and	then	time	here	,	from	1858	i	start	the	world	.
and	we	 s 	 hall 	 	see	what	will	happen	with	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
you	see	,	 chin 	 a 	 	under	foreign	 domin 	 ation 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 lower 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	income	and	came	down	to	the	indian	level	here	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	u.k.	and	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 rich 	 er 	 	and	 rich 	 er 	 	.
and	after	second	world	war	,	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	 rich 	 er 	 	than	u.k	.
but	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	is	coming	here	.
growth	is	 start 	 ing 	 	,	economic	reform	.
growth	is	 fast 	 er 	 	,	and	with	 project 	 ion 	 	from	imf	you	can	see	where	you	expect	them	to	be	in	2014	.
now	,	the	question	is	,	``	when	will	the	catch	up	take	place	?	``
look	at	,	look	at	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
can	you	see	the	bubble	?
the	 bubble 	 s 	 	,	not	my	 bubble 	 s 	 	,	but	the	financial	 bubble 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	dot	com	bubble	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	lehman	 brother 	 s 	 	 door 	 step 	 	there	.
you	see	it	came	down	there	.
and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	rock	coming	down	there	,	you	know	.
so	they	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	to	go	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
they	seem	to	go	in	a	more	humble	growth	way	,	you	know	.
and	people	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	growth	are	 turn 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
i	can	 compar 	 e 	 	to	japan	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	japan	coming	up	.
you	see	,	japan	did	it	like	that	.
we	add	japan	to	it	.
and	there	is	no	doubt	that	fast	catch	up	can	take	place	.
can	you	see	here	what	japan	did	?
japan	did	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	full	catch	up	,	and	then	they	follow	with	the	other	high	-	income	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	.
but	the	real	 project 	 ions 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	i	would	like	to	give	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
can	be	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	can	be	better	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	difficult	to	predict	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	about	the	future	.
now	,	a	historian	 tell 	 s 	 	me	it	's	even	more	difficult	to	predict	about	the	past	.
i	think	i	'm	in	a	difficult	position	here	.
 in 	 equal 	 ities 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	i	consider	 re 	 ally 	 	the	big	obstacle	 be 	 cause 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	entire	population	 in 	 to 	 	growth	and	 prosper 	 ity 	 	is	what	will	create	a	domestic	market	,	what	will	avoid	social	 in 	 st 	 ability 	 	,	and	which	will	make	use	of	the	entire	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	the	population	.
so	,	social	 invest 	 ments 	 	in	health	,	education	and	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	and	 electric 	 ity 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	what	is	 need 	 ed 	 	in	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	.
you	know	the	climate	.	we	have	great	 inter 	 national 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	india	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	that	the	climate	is	changing	,	and	 action 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	taken	,	 other 	 wise 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	would	be	the	 count 	 ries 	 	most	to	suffer	from	climate	change	.
and	i	consider	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	the	best	 partner 	 s 	 	in	the	world	in	a	good	global	climate	policy	.
but	they	ai	n't	going	to	pay	for	what	 other 	 s 	 	,	who	have	more	money	,	have	 large 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	,	and	i	can	agree	on	that	.
but	what	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	is	war	.
will	the	 form 	 er 	 	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	accept	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	world	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	a	shift	of	power	away	from	where	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	last	50	to	100	to	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	back	to	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	?
and	will	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	be	able	to	handle	that	new	position	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	charge	of	 be 	 ing 	 	the	most	 might 	 y 	 	,	and	the	 govern 	 ors 	 	of	the	world	?
so	,	 al 	 ways 	 	avoid	war	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 push 	 es 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 back 	 ward 	 	.
now	if	these	 in 	 equal 	 ities 	 	,	climate	and	war	can	be	 avoid 	 ed 	 	,	get	ready	for	a	world	in	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	vision	that	i	got	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	student	,	1972	,	that	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	can	be	much	better	than	swedes	,	is	just	about	to	happen	.
and	it	will	happen	 precise 	 ly 	 	the	year	2048	in	the	 lat 	 er 	 	part	of	the	summer	,	in	july	,	more	 precise 	 ly 	 	,	the	27th	of	july	.
