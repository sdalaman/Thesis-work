i	am	a	ph.d.	student	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	i	have	a	question	:	how	can	we	make	digital	content	 grasp 	 able 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	you	see	,	on	the	one	hand	,	there	is	the	digital	world	and	no	question	,	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	there	right	now	.
and	for	us	 human 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	material	,	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	there	--	it	's	virtual	.
on	the	other	hand	,	we	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	live	in	a	physical	world	.
it	's	rich	,	it	 taste 	 s 	 	good	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	good	,	it	 smell 	 s 	 	good	.
so	the	question	is	:	how	do	we	get	the	stuff	over	from	the	digital	 in 	 to 	 	the	physical	?
that	's	my	question	.
if	you	look	at	the	iphone	with	 it 	 s 	 	touch	and	the	wii	with	 it 	 s 	 	 bod 	 ily 	 	activity	,	you	can	see	the	 tend 	 ency 	 	;	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	physical	.
the	question	is	:	what	's	next	?
now	,	i	have	three	 option 	 s 	 	that	i	would	like	to	show	you	.
the	first	one	is	mass	.
 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	are	sensitive	to	where	an	object	in	our	hand	is	heavy	.
so	,	could	we	use	that	in	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	?
let	me	show	you	the	weight	-	shifting	mobile	.
it	is	a	mobile	phone	-	shaped	box	that	 ha 	 s 	 	an	iron	weight	 in 	 side 	 	,	which	we	can	move	around	,	and	you	can	feel	where	it	's	heavy	.
we	shift	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	center	of	it	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	can	augment	digital	content	with	physical	mass	.
so	you	move	around	the	content	on	a	 dis 	 play 	 	,	but	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	feel	where	it	is	just	from	the	weight	of	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	it	's	good	for	is	 navig 	 ation 	 	--	it	can	guide	you	around	in	a	city	.
it	can	tell	you	by	 it 	 s 	 	weight	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	move	right	.	walk	 a 	 head 	 	.	make	a	left	here	.	``
and	the	good	thing	about	that	is	you	do	n't	have	to	look	at	the	 de 	 vice 	 	all	the	time	;	you	have	your	 eye 	 s 	 	free	to	see	the	city	.
now	,	mass	is	the	first	thing	;	the	second	thing	,	that	's	shape	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	sensitive	to	the	shape	of	 object 	 s 	 	we	have	in	[	our	]	 hand 	 s 	 	.
so	if	i	download	an	 e 	 - 	 book 	 	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	20	 page 	 s 	 	--	well	,	they	could	be	thin	,	right	--	but	if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	500	 page 	 s 	 	,	i	want	to	feel	that	``	harry	potter	``	--	it	's	thick	.
so	let	me	show	you	the	shape	-	changing	mobile	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	a	mobile	phone	-	shaped	box	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	can	change	 it 	 s 	 	shape	.
we	can	play	with	the	shape	 it 	 self 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	it	can	be	thin	in	your	pocket	,	which	we	of	course	want	it	to	be	;	but	then	if	you	hold	it	in	your	hand	,	it	can	lean	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	you	,	be	thick	.
it	's	like	 taper 	 ed 	 	to	the	 down 	 side 	 	.
if	you	change	the	grasp	,	it	can	adjust	to	that	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	if	you	want	to	put	it	down	on	your	 night 	 stand 	 	to	watch	a	movie	or	use	 a 	 s 	 	an	alarm	clock	,	it	 stand 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	is	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	watch	 thing 	 s 	 	on	a	mobile	phone	,	they	are	 big 	 ger 	 	than	the	phone	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	in	that	case	--	like	here	,	there	's	an	app	that	's	 big 	 ger 	 	than	the	phone	's	screen	--	the	shape	of	the	phone	could	tell	you	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	off	the	screen	right	here	,	there	is	more	content	.
you	ca	n't	see	it	,	but	it	's	there	.	``
and	you	can	feel	that	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 thick 	 er 	 	at	that	edge	.
the	shape	is	the	second	thing	.
the	third	thing	 oper 	 ates 	 	on	a	different	level	.
 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	are	social	,	we	are	 empath 	 ic 	 	,	and	that	's	great	.
would	n't	that	be	a	way	to	make	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	more	intuitive	?
think	of	a	 ham 	 ster 	 	in	the	pocket	.
well	,	i	can	feel	it	,	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	all	right	--	i	do	n't	have	to	check	it	.
let	me	show	you	the	living	mobile	phone	.
so	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	mobile	phone	-	shaped	box	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	breath	and	a	 heart 	 beat 	 	,	and	it	 feel 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	.
and	you	can	tell	,	it	's	 relax 	 ed 	 	right	now	.
oh	now	,	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	call	,	a	new	call	,	new	girlfriend	 may 	 be 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
how	do	we	calm	it	down	?
you	give	it	a	pat	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 ear 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	is	all	right	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	,	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	intuitive	,	and	that	's	what	we	want	.
so	,	what	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	are	three	ways	to	make	the	digital	 grasp 	 able 	 	for	us	.
and	i	think	making	it	physical	is	a	good	way	to	do	that	.
what	's	 be 	 hind 	 	that	is	a	 post 	 ul 	 ation 	 	,	 name 	 ly 	 	that	not	 human 	 s 	 	should	get	much	more	technical	in	the	future	;	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	that	,	technology	,	a	bit	more	human	.
