you	all	know	the	truth	of	what	i	'm	going	to	say	.
i	think	the	 intuit 	 ion 	 	that	 ine 	 quality 	 	is	divisive	and	 social 	 ly 	 	 corros 	 ive 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	since	before	the	french	revolution	.
what	's	 change 	 d 	 	is	we	now	can	look	at	the	evidence	,	we	can	 compar 	 e 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	more	and	less	equal	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	and	see	what	 ine 	 quality 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	take	you	through	that	data	and	then	explain	why	the	 link 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	be	 show 	 ing 	 	you	exist	.
but	first	,	see	what	a	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	lot	we	are	.
i	want	to	start	 th 	 ough 	 	with	a	paradox	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	you	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	against	gross	national	income	--	how	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	are	on	average	.
and	you	see	the	 count 	 ries 	 	on	the	right	,	like	norway	and	the	usa	,	are	twice	 a 	 s 	 	rich	 a 	 s 	 	israel	,	greece	,	portugal	on	the	left	.
and	it	 make 	 s 	 	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	at	all	.
there	's	no	 suggest 	 ion 	 	of	a	relationship	there	.
but	if	we	look	 with 	 in 	 	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	there	are	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	social	 grad 	 ient 	 s 	 	in	health	running	right	 a 	 cross 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	.
these	are	small	 area 	 s 	 	of	england	and	wales	--	the	 poor 	 est 	 	on	the	right	,	the	 rich 	 est 	 	on	the	left	.
a	lot	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	poor	and	the	rest	of	us	.
even	the	people	just	 be 	 low 	 	the	top	have	less	good	health	than	the	people	at	the	top	.
so	income	 mean 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 with 	 in 	 	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	between	them	.
the	 explan 	 ation 	 	of	that	paradox	is	that	,	 with 	 in 	 	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	we	're	looking	at	 relat 	 ive 	 	income	or	social	position	,	social	 stat 	 us 	 	--	where	we	are	in	relation	to	each	other	and	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 gap 	 s 	 	between	us	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	you	've	got	that	idea	,	you	should	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	wonder	:	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	we	widen	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	or	compress	them	,	make	the	income	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	or	 small 	 er 	 	?
and	that	's	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	.
i	'm	not	using	any	hypothetical	data	.
i	'm	taking	data	from	the	u.n.	--	it	's	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	world	bank	 ha 	 s 	 	--	on	the	scale	of	income	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	these	rich	 develop 	 ed 	 	market	 demo 	 cracies 	 	.
the	measure	we	've	used	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	easy	to	understand	and	you	can	download	it	,	is	how	much	 rich 	 er 	 	the	top	20	percent	than	the	bottom	20	percent	in	each	country	.
and	you	see	in	the	more	equal	 count 	 ries 	 	on	the	left	--	japan	,	finland	,	norway	,	sweden	--	the	top	20	percent	are	about	three	and	a	half	,	four	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	rich	 a 	 s 	 	the	bottom	20	percent	.
but	on	the	more	 un 	 equal 	 	end	--	u.k.	,	portugal	,	usa	,	singapore	--	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	are	twice	 a 	 s 	 	big	.
on	that	measure	,	we	are	twice	 a 	 s 	 	 un 	 equal 	 	 a 	 s 	 	some	of	the	other	 success 	 ful 	 	market	 demo 	 cracies 	 	.
now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	what	that	 do 	 es 	 	to	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
we	 collect 	 ed 	 	data	on	 problem 	 s 	 	with	social	 grad 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	the	kind	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	more	common	at	the	bottom	of	the	social	 lad 	 der 	 	.
 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	 compar 	 able 	 	data	on	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	,	on	 kid 	 s 	 	'	 math 	 s 	 	and	 liter 	 acy 	 	 score 	 s 	 	,	on	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rates	,	 hom 	 icide 	 	rates	,	proportion	of	the	population	in	 pri 	 son 	 	,	 teen 	 age 	 	 birth 	 rates 	 	,	 level 	 s 	 	of	trust	,	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	--	which	in	standard	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	 class 	 ification 	 	 include 	 s 	 	drug	and	alcohol	 addict 	 ion 	 	--	and	social	 mobil 	 ity 	 	.
we	put	them	all	in	one	index	.
they	're	all	 weight 	 ed 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	.
where	a	country	is	is	a	sort	of	average	score	on	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	there	,	you	see	it	in	relation	to	the	measure	of	 ine 	 quality 	 	i	've	just	 show 	 n 	 	you	,	which	i	 s 	 hall 	 	use	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	in	the	data	.
the	more	 un 	 equal 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	on	all	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	social	 problem 	 s 	 	.
it	's	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	close	correlation	.
but	if	you	look	at	that	same	index	of	health	and	social	 problem 	 s 	 	in	relation	to	gnp	per	capita	,	gross	national	income	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	there	,	no	correlation	 any 	 more 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	a	little	bit	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	people	might	think	we	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 choos 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	to	suit	our	argument	and	just	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	evidence	,	so	we	 al 	 so 	 	did	a	paper	in	the	british	medical	journal	on	the	unicef	index	of	child	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	40	different	 component 	 s 	 	put	together	by	other	people	.
it	 contain 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	can	talk	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	have	 book 	 s 	 	at	home	,	what	 immun 	 ization 	 	rates	are	like	,	 whet 	 her 	 	there	's	 bull 	 y 	 ing 	 	at	school	.
 every 	 thing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
here	it	is	in	relation	to	that	same	measure	of	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
 kid 	 s 	 	do	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	the	more	 un 	 equal 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
 high 	 ly 	 	significant	relationship	.
but	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	if	you	look	at	that	measure	of	child	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,	in	relation	to	national	income	per	person	,	there	's	no	relationship	,	no	 suggest 	 ion 	 	of	a	relationship	.
what	all	the	data	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	so	far	 say 	 s 	 	is	the	same	thing	.
the	average	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	is	not	dependent	any	 long 	 er 	 	on	national	income	and	economic	growth	.
that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 poor 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	but	not	in	the	rich	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	.
but	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	us	and	where	we	are	in	relation	to	each	other	now	matter	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	some	of	the	 separat 	 e 	 	bits	of	our	index	.
here	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	is	trust	.
it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	the	proportion	of	the	population	who	agree	most	people	can	be	 trust 	 ed 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	world	 value 	 s 	 	survey	.
you	see	,	at	the	more	 un 	 equal 	 	end	,	it	's	about	15	percent	of	the	population	who	feel	they	can	trust	 other 	 s 	 	.
but	in	the	more	equal	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	it	 rise 	 s 	 	to	60	or	65	percent	.
and	if	you	look	at	 measure 	 s 	 	of	 involve 	 ment 	 	in	community	life	or	social	capital	,	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 relationship 	 s 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	related	to	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
i	may	say	,	we	did	all	 th 	 is 	 	work	twice	.
we	did	it	first	on	these	rich	,	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	then	 a 	 s 	 	a	 separat 	 e 	 	test	bed	,	we	 repeat 	 ed 	 	it	all	on	the	50	american	 state 	 s 	 	--	 ask 	 ing 	 	just	the	same	question	:	do	the	more	 un 	 equal 	 	 state 	 s 	 	do	 wo 	 rse 	 	on	all	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 measure 	 s 	 	?
so	here	is	trust	from	a	general	social	survey	of	the	federal	government	related	to	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	similar	scatter	over	a	similar	range	of	 level 	 s 	 	of	trust	.
same	thing	is	going	on	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	we	found	that	 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	related	to	trust	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	is	related	to	trust	 among 	 st 	 	the	50	 state 	 s 	 	in	that	 separat 	 e 	 	test	bed	.
we	're	not	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	 flu 	 ke 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
who	put	together	 figure 	 s 	 	using	the	same	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	 interview 	 s 	 	on	random	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	population	to	allow	us	to	 compar 	 e 	 	rates	of	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	in	each	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	percent	of	the	population	with	any	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	in	the	 p 	 reced 	 ing 	 	year	.
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	from	about	eight	percent	up	to	three	 time 	 s 	 	that	--	with	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	level	of	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 close 	 ly 	 	related	to	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	violence	.
these	red	 dot 	 s 	 	are	american	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	the	blue	 triangle 	 s 	 	are	canadian	 pro 	 vince 	 s 	 	.
but	look	at	the	scale	of	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	from	15	 hom 	 icide 	 s 	 	per	million	up	to	150	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	proportion	of	the	population	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.
there	's	a	about	a	 ten 	 fold 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	there	,	log	scale	up	the	side	.
but	it	 go 	 es 	 	from	about	40	to	400	people	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.
that	relationship	is	not	 main 	 ly 	 	driven	by	more	crime	.
in	some	 place 	 s 	 	,	that	's	part	of	it	.
but	most	of	it	is	about	more	 pun 	 it 	 ive 	 	 s 	 ent 	 encing 	 	,	 harsh 	 er 	 	 s 	 ent 	 encing 	 	.
and	the	more	 un 	 equal 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	are	more	 like 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	to	retain	the	death	 penal 	 ty 	 	.
here	we	have	children	dropping	out	of	high	school	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	big	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 dam 	 aging 	 	,	if	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	using	the	 talent 	 s 	 	of	the	population	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	social	 mobil 	 ity 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	measure	of	 mobil 	 ity 	 	based	on	income	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	it	's	 ask 	 ing 	 	:	do	rich	 father 	 s 	 	have	rich	 son 	 s 	 	and	poor	 father 	 s 	 	have	poor	 son 	 s 	 	,	or	is	there	no	relationship	between	the	two	?
and	at	the	more	 un 	 equal 	 	end	,	 father 	 s 	 	'	income	is	much	more	 import 	 ant 	 	--	in	the	u.k.	,	usa	.
and	in	scandinavian	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 father 	 s 	 	'	income	is	much	less	 import 	 ant 	 	.
there	's	more	social	 mobil 	 ity 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	like	to	say	--	and	i	know	there	are	a	lot	of	americans	in	the	audience	here	--	if	americans	want	to	live	the	american	dream	,	they	should	go	to	denmark	.
i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	just	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 ital 	 ic 	 s 	 	here	.
i	could	have	 show 	 n 	 	a	number	of	other	 problem 	 s 	 	.
they	're	all	 problem 	 s 	 	that	tend	to	be	more	common	at	the	bottom	of	the	social	 grad 	 ient 	 	.
but	there	are	 end 	 less 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	with	social	 grad 	 ient 	 s 	 	that	are	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	more	 un 	 equal 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	not	just	a	little	bit	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	but	 any 	 thing 	 	from	twice	 a 	 s 	 	common	to	10	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	common	.
think	of	the	expense	,	the	human	cost	of	that	.
i	want	to	go	back	 th 	 ough 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	graph	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	 ear 	 lier 	 	where	we	put	it	all	together	to	make	two	 point 	 s 	 	.
one	is	that	,	in	graph	after	graph	,	we	find	the	 count 	 ries 	 	that	do	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	the	 out 	 come 	 	,	seem	to	be	the	more	 un 	 equal 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	do	well	seem	to	be	the	nordic	 count 	 ries 	 	and	japan	.
so	what	we	're	looking	at	is	general	social	 dis 	 function 	 	related	to	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
it	's	not	just	one	or	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	go	wrong	,	it	's	most	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	other	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	point	i	want	to	make	on	 th 	 is 	 	graph	is	that	,	if	you	look	at	the	bottom	,	sweden	and	japan	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 count 	 ries 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	ways	.
the	position	of	women	,	how	 close 	 ly 	 	they	keep	to	the	nuclear	family	,	are	on	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 end 	 s 	 	of	the	 pole 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	rich	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	.
but	 an 	 other 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	how	they	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 great 	 er 	 	 e 	 quality 	 	.
sweden	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 earn 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 narrow 	 s 	 	the	gap	through	 tax 	 ation 	 	,	general	 wel 	 fare 	 	state	,	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
japan	is	 ra 	 ther 	 	different	 th 	 ough 	 	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	off	with	much	 small 	 er 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 earn 	 ing 	 s 	 	before	tax	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	lower	 tax 	 es 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 small 	 er 	 	 wel 	 fare 	 	state	.
and	in	our	analysis	of	the	american	 state 	 s 	 	,	we	find	 ra 	 ther 	 	the	same	contrast	.
there	are	some	 state 	 s 	 	that	do	well	through	 re 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	some	 state 	 s 	 	that	do	well	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	 small 	 er 	 	income	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	before	tax	.
so	we	conclude	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	much	matter	how	you	get	your	 great 	 er 	 	 e 	 quality 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	there	 some 	 how 	 	.
i	am	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	perfect	 e 	 quality 	 	,	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	what	 exist 	 s 	 	in	rich	 develop 	 ed 	 	market	 demo 	 cracies 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	surprising	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	that	it	's	not	just	the	poor	who	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
there	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	some	truth	in	john	donne	's	``	no	man	is	an	 is 	 land 	 	.	``
and	in	a	number	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	it	's	possible	to	 compar 	 e 	 	how	people	do	in	more	and	less	equal	 count 	 ries 	 	at	each	level	in	the	social	 hierarch 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
it	's	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
some	swedes	 ver 	 y 	 	 kind 	 ly 	 	 class 	 ified 	 	a	lot	of	 the 	 ir 	 	infant	 death 	 s 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	british	register	of	general	 socio 	 economic 	 	 class 	 ification 	 	.
and	so	it	's	 anachron 	 istically 	 	a	 class 	 ification 	 	by	 father 	 s 	 	'	 occupation 	 s 	 	,	so	single	 parent 	 s 	 	go	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
but	then	where	it	 say 	 s 	 	``	low	social	class	,	``	that	's	 un 	 skill 	 ed 	 	manual	 occupation 	 s 	 	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	through	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 skill 	 ed 	 	manual	 occupation 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	,	then	the	 juni 	 or 	 	non	-	manual	,	going	up	high	to	the	professional	 occupation 	 s 	 	--	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	 director 	 s 	 	of	 large 	 r 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
you	see	there	that	sweden	 do 	 es 	 	better	than	britain	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	social	 hierarch 	 y 	 	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	are	at	the	bottom	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
but	even	at	the	top	,	there	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	a	small	benefit	to	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	more	equal	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
we	show	that	on	about	five	different	 set 	 s 	 	of	data	 cover 	 ing 	 	 education 	 al 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	and	health	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	.
and	that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	the	general	picture	--	that	 great 	 er 	 	 e 	 quality 	 	 make 	 s 	 	most	 differ 	 ence 	 	at	the	bottom	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 benefit 	 s 	 	even	at	the	top	.
but	i	should	say	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	about	what	's	going	on	.
i	think	i	'm	looking	and	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 psycho 	 social 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
more	to	do	with	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 super 	 ior 	 ity 	 	and	 infer 	 ior 	 ity 	 	,	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 valu 	 ed 	 	and	 d 	 evalu 	 ed 	 	,	 respect 	 ed 	 	and	 dis 	 respect 	 ed 	 	.

it	 al 	 so 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 stat 	 us 	 	 in 	 security 	 	.
we	worry	more	about	how	we	're	 judg 	 ed 	 	and	 s 	 een 	 	by	 other 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	 regard 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	,	clever	,	all	that	kind	of	thing	.

and	in	the	review	,	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 see 	 ing 	 	is	what	kind	of	 stress 	 es 	 	most	 reli 	 ably 	 	raise	 level 	 s 	 	of	 cort 	 isol 	 	,	the	central	stress	hormone	.
and	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	was	it	was	 task 	 s 	 	that	 include 	 d 	 	social	-	evaluative	threat	--	 threat 	 s 	 	to	self	-	esteem	or	social	 stat 	 us 	 	in	which	 other 	 s 	 	can	 negative 	 ly 	 	 judg 	 e 	 	your	performance	.
 t 	 hose 	 	kind	of	 stress 	 es 	 	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	effect	on	the	physiology	of	stress	.
now	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 critic 	 ized 	 	.
of	course	,	there	are	people	who	 dis 	 like 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	and	people	who	find	it	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	.
i	should	tell	you	 th 	 ough 	 	that	when	people	 critic 	 ize 	 	us	for	 pick 	 ing 	 	and	 choos 	 ing 	 	data	,	we	never	pick	and	 choos 	 e 	 	data	.
we	have	an	absolute	rule	that	if	our	data	source	 ha 	 s 	 	data	for	one	of	the	 count 	 ries 	 	we	're	looking	at	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	analysis	.
our	data	source	 decide 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 reli 	 able 	 	data	,	we	do	n't	.
 other 	 wise 	 	that	would	 introduc 	 e 	 	bias	.
what	about	other	 count 	 ries 	 	?
there	are	200	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	health	in	relation	to	income	and	 e 	 quality 	 	in	the	academic	peer	-	 review 	 ed 	 	 journal 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	to	these	 count 	 ries 	 	here	,	 hid 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 demonst 	 ration 	 	.
the	same	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	same	measure	of	 ine 	 quality 	 	,	one	problem	after	 an 	 other 	 	.
why	do	n't	we	control	for	other	 factor 	 s 	 	?
well	we	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	that	gnp	per	capita	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	of	course	,	 other 	 s 	 	using	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 method 	 s 	 	in	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	have	controlled	for	poverty	and	education	and	so	on	.
what	about	 caus 	 ality 	 	?
correlation	in	 it 	 self 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	prove	 caus 	 ality 	 	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	a	good	bit	of	time	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	people	know	the	 caus 	 al 	 	 link 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	well	in	some	of	these	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
the	big	change	in	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 driver 	 s 	 	of	chronic	health	in	the	rich	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	is	how	 import 	 ant 	 	chronic	stress	from	social	 source 	 s 	 	is	 affect 	 ing 	 	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	,	the	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	system	.
or	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	the	reason	why	violence	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	common	in	more	 un 	 equal 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	people	are	sensitive	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	down	on	.
i	should	say	that	to	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	've	got	to	deal	with	the	post	-	tax	 thing 	 s 	 	and	the	pre	-	tax	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	've	got	to	 con 	 s 	 train 	 	income	,	the	 bon 	 us 	 	culture	 income 	 s 	 	at	the	top	.
i	think	we	must	make	our	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	 account 	 able 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	in	any	way	we	can	.
i	think	the	take	-	home	 mess 	 age 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	is	that	we	can	improve	the	real	quality	of	human	life	by	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 income 	 s 	 	between	us	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	we	have	a	handle	on	the	 psycho 	 social 	 	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	whole	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	and	that	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
thank	you	.
