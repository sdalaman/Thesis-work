i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	the	market	one	day	with	my	wife	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	a	cage	in	my	face	.
and	in	between	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 lit 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 s 	 add 	 est 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	i	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	sick	orangutan	baby	,	my	first	 en 	 counter 	 	.
that	 even 	 ing 	 	i	came	back	to	the	market	in	the	dark	and	i	heard	``	 uh 	 h 	 	,	 uh 	 h 	 	,	``	and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	i	found	a	 dy 	 ing 	 	orangutan	baby	on	a	garbage	heap	.
of	course	,	the	cage	was	 salv 	 aged 	 	.
i	took	up	the	little	baby	,	 mass 	 aged 	 	her	,	 force 	 d 	 	her	to	drink	 un 	 til 	 	she	 final 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 breath 	 ing 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	uce	.
she	's	now	living	in	the	jungle	of	sungai	wain	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	matahari	,	her	second	son	,	which	,	by	the	way	,	is	 al 	 so 	 	the	son	of	the	second	orangutan	i	 rescu 	 ed 	 	,	dodoy	.
that	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	 quit 	 e 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	have	 al 	 most 	 	1,000	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	my	two	 center 	 s 	 	.
no	.	no	.	no	.	wrong	.
it	's	 horr 	 ible 	 	.	it	's	a	proof	of	our	 fail 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	them	in	the	wild	.
it	's	not	good	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 mere 	 ly 	 	proof	of	 every 	 one 	 	 fail 	 ing 	 	to	do	the	right	thing	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	more	than	all	the	 orangutan 	 s 	 	in	all	the	 zoo 	 s 	 	in	the	world	together	,	just	now	like	 victim 	 s 	 	for	every	baby	,	six	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	from	the	forest	.
the	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	oil	palm	,	to	provide	 bio 	 fuel 	 	for	western	 count 	 ries 	 	is	what	's	 caus 	 ing 	 	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 pe 	 at 	 	swamp	 forest 	 s 	 	on	20	 meter 	 s 	 	of	 pe 	 at 	 	,	the	largest	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 organ 	 ic 	 	material	in	the	world	.
when	you	open	 th 	 is 	 	for	growing	oil	 palm 	 s 	 	you	're	creating	co	2	 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	that	are	 emit 	 ting 	 	so	much	co	2	that	my	country	is	now	the	third	largest	 emit 	 ter 	 	of	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	in	the	world	,	after	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	we	do	n't	have	any	industry	at	all	--	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	.
and	these	are	 horr 	 ible 	 	 image 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	going	to	talk	too	long	about	it	,	but	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	family	of	uce	,	which	are	not	so	fortunate	to	live	out	there	in	the	forest	,	that	still	have	to	go	through	that	process	.
and	i	do	n't	know	 any 	 more 	 	where	to	put	them	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	had	to	come	up	with	a	solution	for	her	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	solution	that	will	benefit	the	people	that	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	exploit	 t 	 hose 	 	 forest 	 s 	 	,	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	the	last	timber	and	that	are	 caus 	 ing 	 	,	in	that	way	,	the	loss	of	 habit 	 at 	 	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 create 	 d 	 	the	place	samboja	lestari	,	and	the	idea	was	,	if	i	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	worst	possible	place	that	i	can	think	of	where	there	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	left	,	no	one	will	have	an	excuse	to	say	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	.	.	.	``
no	.	 every 	 one 	 	should	be	able	to	follow	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	we	're	in	east	borneo	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	place	where	i	 start 	 ed 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	yellow	 terra 	 in 	 	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	left	--	just	a	bit	of	grass	there	.
in	2002	we	had	about	50	percent	of	the	people	 job 	 less 	 	there	.
there	was	a	huge	amount	of	crime	.
people	 s 	 pent 	 	so	much	of	 the 	 ir 	 	money	on	health	 issue 	 s 	 	and	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
there	was	no	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 product 	 ivity 	 	left	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 di 	 strict 	 	in	the	whole	 pro 	 vince 	 	and	it	was	a	total	 extinct 	 ion 	 	of	 wild 	 life 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	like	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	desert	.
when	i	stood	there	in	the	grass	,	it	's	hot	--	not	even	the	sound	of	 insect 	 s 	 	--	just	 th 	 is 	 	 wav 	 ing 	 	grass	.
still	,	four	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	we	have	 create 	 d 	 	 job 	 s 	 	for	about	3,000	people	.
the	climate	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.	i	will	show	you	:	no	more	 flood 	 ing 	 	,	no	more	 fire 	 s 	 	.
it	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 di 	 strict 	 	,	and	there	is	a	huge	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
we	've	got	over	1,000	species	.	we	have	137	bird	species	 a 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	have	30	species	of	 reptil 	 es 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	?	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	huge	economic	failure	in	 th 	 is 	 	forest	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	whole	process	of	 destruct 	 ion 	 	had	gone	a	bit	 s 	 lower 	 	than	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	with	the	oil	palm	.
but	we	saw	the	same	thing	.
we	had	 s 	 lash 	 	and	burn	 agricultur 	 e 	 	;	people	can	not	afford	the	 fertil 	 izer 	 	,	so	they	burn	the	 tree 	 s 	 	and	have	the	 mineral 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	there	;	the	 fire 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	more	frequent	,	and	after	a	while	you	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	an	area	of	land	where	there	is	no	 fertil 	 ity 	 	left	.
there	are	no	 tree 	 s 	 	left	.
still	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 grass 	 land 	 	where	you	can	see	our	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 off 	 ice 	 	there	on	that	hill	,	four	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	one	green	 b 	 lop 	 	on	the	earth	's	surface	...
and	there	are	all	these	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	all	these	people	happy	,	and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	economic	value	.
so	how	's	 th 	 is 	 	possible	?
it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	simple	.	if	you	'll	look	at	the	 step 	 s 	 	:	we	 b 	 ought 	 	the	land	,	we	 deal 	 t 	 	with	the	fire	,	and	then	 on 	 ly 	 	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 re 	 forest 	 ation 	 	by	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	with	 forest 	 ry 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	then	we	set	up	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	management	and	the	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	.
but	we	made	 s 	 ure 	 	that	in	every	step	of	the	way	the	local	people	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	fully	 involve 	 d 	 	so	that	no	 out 	 side 	 	 force 	 s 	 	would	be	able	to	interfere	with	that	.
the	people	would	 be 	 come 	 	the	 defend 	 ers 	 	of	that	forest	.
so	we	do	the	``	people	,	profit	,	planet	``	 principle 	 s 	 	,	but	we	do	it	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	a	 s 	 ure 	 	legal	 stat 	 us 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	if	the	forest	 belong 	 s 	 	to	the	state	,	people	say	,	``	it	 belong 	 s 	 	to	me	,	it	 belong 	 s 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	.	``
and	then	we	 app 	 ly 	 	all	these	other	 principle 	 s 	 	like	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	professional	management	,	 measur 	 able 	 	 result 	 s 	 	,	 scal 	 ability 	 	,	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	etc	.
what	we	did	was	we	 formula 	 ted 	 	 recipe 	 s 	 	--	how	to	go	from	a	 start 	 ing 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	you	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	a	target	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
you	 form 	 ulate 	 	a	recipe	based	 up 	 on 	 	the	 factor 	 s 	 	you	can	control	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	the	 skill 	 s 	 	or	the	 fertil 	 izer 	 	or	the	plant	choice	.
and	then	you	look	at	the	 out 	 put 	 s 	 	and	you	start	 measur 	 ing 	 	what	 come 	 s 	 	out	.
now	in	 th 	 is 	 	recipe	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	cost	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	know	how	much	labor	is	 need 	 ed 	 	.
if	you	can	drop	 th 	 is 	 	recipe	on	the	map	on	a	 sand 	 y 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	,	on	a	clay	 s 	 oil 	 	,	on	a	steep	 slop 	 e 	 	,	on	flat	 s 	 oil 	 	,	you	put	 t 	 hose 	 	different	 recipe 	 s 	 	;	if	you	combine	them	,	out	of	that	 come 	 s 	 	a	business	plan	,	 come 	 s 	 	a	work	plan	,	and	you	can	optimize	it	for	the	amount	of	labor	you	have	 avail 	 able 	 	or	for	the	amount	of	 fertil 	 izer 	 	you	have	,	and	you	can	do	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	in	practice	.	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	grass	we	want	to	get	rid	of	.
it	 exude 	 s 	 	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	-	like	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	from	the	 root 	 s 	 	.
the	acacia	 tree 	 s 	 	are	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	value	but	we	need	them	to	 re 	 store 	 	the	micro	-	climate	,	to	protect	the	 s 	 oil 	 	and	to	shake	out	the	 grass 	 es 	 	.
and	after	eight	 year 	 s 	 	they	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	yield	some	timber	--	that	is	,	if	you	can	preserve	it	in	the	right	way	,	which	we	can	do	with	bamboo	 peel 	 s 	 	.
it	's	an	old	temple	-	building	 techni 	 que 	 	from	japan	but	bamboo	is	 ver 	 y 	 	fire	-	susceptible	.
so	if	we	would	plant	that	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	we	would	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	risk	of	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	we	plant	it	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	 water 	 ways 	 	to	filter	the	water	,	provide	the	raw	 product 	 s 	 	just	in	time	for	when	the	timber	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
so	the	idea	is	:	how	to	integrate	these	 flow 	 s 	 	in	space	,	over	time	and	with	the	 limit 	 ed 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	you	have	.
so	we	plant	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	we	plant	these	 pine 	 apple 	 s 	 	and	 bean 	 s 	 	and	 ging 	 er 	 	in	between	,	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 com 	 petition 	 	for	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	the	crop	 fertil 	 izer 	 	.	 organ 	 ic 	 	material	is	 use 	 ful 	 	for	the	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	,	for	the	people	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 help 	 s 	 	the	 tree 	 s 	 	.	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	have	free	land	,	the	system	 yield 	 s 	 	early	income	,	the	 orangutan 	 s 	 	get	 health 	 y 	 	food	and	we	can	speed	up	 eco 	 system 	 	 re 	 generation 	 	while	even	saving	some	money	.
so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.	what	a	 theor 	 y 	 	.
but	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	that	easy	?
not	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	1998	,	the	fire	 start 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	area	of	about	50	million	 hectare 	 s 	 	.
january	.
february	.
march	.
april	.
may	.
we	lost	5.5	million	 hectare 	 s 	 	in	just	a	matter	of	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	10,000	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 under 	 ground 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	that	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	in	pennsylvania	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	once	the	 s 	 oil 	 	 get 	 s 	 	dried	,	you	're	in	a	dry	season	--	you	get	 crack 	 s 	 	,	oxygen	 go 	 es 	 	in	,	 flame 	 s 	 	come	out	and	the	problem	 start 	 s 	 	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	how	to	break	that	cycle	?
fire	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	problem	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	for	three	 month 	 s 	 	.
for	three	 month 	 s 	 	,	the	 autom 	 atic 	 	 light 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	did	not	go	off	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	that	dark	.
we	lost	all	the	 crop 	 s 	 	.	no	children	 gain 	 ed 	 	weight	for	over	a	year	;	they	lost	12	iq	 point 	 s 	 	.	it	was	a	disaster	for	 orangutan 	 s 	 	and	people	.
so	these	 fire 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	to	work	on	.
that	was	why	i	put	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	single	point	up	there	.
and	you	need	the	local	people	for	that	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 grass 	 land 	 s 	 	,	once	they	start	 burn 	 ing 	 	...	it	 go 	 es 	 	through	it	like	a	 wind 	 storm 	 	and	you	lose	 aga 	 in 	 	the	last	bit	of	ash	and	 nutrient 	 s 	 	to	the	first	 rain 	 fall 	 	--	going	to	the	sea	 kill 	 ing 	 	off	the	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	there	.
so	you	have	to	do	it	with	the	local	people	.
that	is	the	short	-	term	solution	but	you	 al 	 so 	 	need	a	long	-	term	solution	.
so	what	we	did	is	,	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	ring	of	sugar	 palm 	 s 	 	around	the	area	.
these	sugar	 palm 	 s 	 	turn	out	to	be	fire	-	resistant	--	 al 	 so 	 	flood	-	resistant	,	by	the	way	--	and	they	provide	a	lot	of	income	for	local	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	:	the	people	have	to	tap	them	twice	a	day	--	just	a	millimeter	slice	--	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	you	harvest	is	sugar	water	,	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	rain	fall	and	a	little	bit	of	 s 	 un 	 shine 	 	.
in	principle	,	you	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	photovoltaic	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	create	so	much	energy	from	 th 	 is 	 	--	they	produce	three	 time 	 s 	 	more	energy	per	hectare	per	year	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	tap	them	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
you	do	n't	need	to	harvest	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	or	any	other	of	the	 crop 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	combination	where	we	have	all	 th 	 is 	 	genetic	potential	in	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	,	which	is	still	 un 	 exploit 	 ed 	 	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	combination	with	technology	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	your	legal	side	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	in	 ver 	 y 	 	good	order	.
so	we	 b 	 ought 	 	that	land	,	and	here	is	where	we	 start 	 ed 	 	our	project	--	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	.
and	if	you	zoom	in	a	bit	you	can	see	that	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	area	is	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 strip 	 s 	 	that	go	over	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 oil 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 monitor 	 ing 	 	,	 measur 	 ing 	 	every	single	tree	in	these	2,000	 hectare 	 s 	 	,	5,000	 acre 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	forest	is	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	did	was	i	just	 follow 	 ed 	 	nature	,	and	nature	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	 mono 	 culture 	 s 	 	,	but	a	natural	forest	is	 multi 	 layer 	 ed 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	both	in	the	ground	and	above	the	ground	it	can	make	better	use	of	the	 avail 	 able 	 	light	,	it	can	store	more	carbon	in	the	system	,	it	can	provide	more	 function 	 s 	 	.
but	,	it	's	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	.	it	's	not	that	simple	,	and	you	have	to	work	with	the	people	.
so	,	just	like	nature	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	grow	fast	 plant 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	and	 under 	 neath 	 	that	,	we	grow	the	 s 	 lower 	 	growing	,	 prim 	 ary 	 	-	grain	forest	 tree 	 s 	 	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 divers 	 ity 	 	that	can	 optimal 	 ly 	 	use	that	light	.	then	,	what	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	:	get	the	right	fungi	in	there	that	will	grow	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 	back	the	 nutrient 	 s 	 	to	the	 root 	 s 	 	of	the	 tree 	 s 	 	that	have	just	 drop 	 ped 	 	that	leaf	 with 	 in 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 be 	 come 	 	like	nutrient	 pump 	 s 	 	.
you	need	the	bacteria	to	fix	nitrogen	,	and	 with 	 out 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 micro 	 organism 	 s 	 	,	you	wo	n't	have	any	performance	at	all	.
and	then	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 plant 	 ing 	 	--	 on 	 ly 	 	1,000	 tree 	 s 	 	a	day	.
we	could	have	 plant 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	more	,	but	we	did	n't	want	to	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	keep	the	number	of	 job 	 s 	 	 s 	 table 	 	.
we	did	n't	want	to	lose	the	people	that	are	going	to	work	in	that	 plant 	 ation 	 	.
and	we	do	a	lot	of	work	here	.
we	use	 indic 	 ator 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	to	look	at	what	 s 	 oil 	 	 type 	 s 	 	,	or	what	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	will	grow	,	or	what	 tree 	 s 	 	will	grow	here	.
and	we	have	 monitor 	 ed 	 	every	single	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	from	space	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	in	 re 	 ality 	 	;	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 ir 	 regular 	 	ring	around	it	,	with	 strip 	 s 	 	of	100	 meter 	 s 	 	wide	,	with	sugar	 palm 	 s 	 	that	can	provide	income	for	648	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	small	part	of	the	area	.
the	 nurse 	 ry 	 	,	in	here	,	is	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
if	you	look	at	the	number	of	tree	species	we	have	in	europe	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	from	the	urals	up	to	england	,	you	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	?
165	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 nurse 	 ry 	 	,	we	're	going	to	grow	10	 time 	 s 	 	more	than	the	number	of	species	.
can	you	imagine	?
you	do	need	to	know	what	you	are	 work 	 ing 	 	with	,	but	it	's	that	 divers 	 ity 	 	which	 make 	 s 	 	it	work	.
that	you	can	go	from	 th 	 is 	 	zero	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	by	 plant 	 ing 	 	the	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	and	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	or	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	the	 tree 	 s 	 	in	the	lines	in	that	grass	there	,	 put 	 ting 	 	up	the	 buff 	 er 	 	zone	,	producing	your	 com 	 post 	 	,	and	then	making	 s 	 ure 	 	that	at	every	stage	of	that	up	growing	forest	there	are	 crop 	 s 	 	that	can	be	used	.
in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 pine 	 apple 	 s 	 	and	 bean 	 s 	 	and	corn	;	in	the	second	phase	,	there	will	be	 banana 	 s 	 	and	 papa 	 ya 	 s 	 	;	 lat 	 er 	 	on	,	there	will	be	chocolate	and	 chili 	 es 	 	.
and	then	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	the	 tree 	 s 	 	start	taking	over	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	produce	from	the	 fruit 	 s 	 	,	from	the	timber	,	from	the	fuel	wood	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	sugar	palm	forest	 take 	 s 	 	over	and	 provide 	 s 	 	the	people	with	permanent	income	.
on	the	top	left	,	 under 	 neath 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	green	 strip 	 es 	 	,	you	see	some	white	 dot 	 s 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	individual	 pine 	 apple 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	that	you	can	see	from	space	.
and	in	that	area	we	 start 	 ed 	 	growing	some	acacia	 tree 	 s 	 	that	you	just	saw	before	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	after	one	year	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	after	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	green	.	if	you	look	from	the	tower	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	we	start	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	grass	.
we	plant	in	the	 seed 	 ling 	 s 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	the	 banana 	 s 	 	,	the	 papa 	 ya 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 crop 	 s 	 	for	the	local	people	,	but	the	 tree 	 s 	 	are	growing	up	fast	in	between	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	137	species	of	 bird 	 s 	 	are	living	here	.
so	we	 lower 	 ed 	 	air	temperature	three	to	five	 degree 	 s 	 	celsius	.
air	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	is	up	10	percent	.
cloud	cover	--	i	'm	going	to	show	it	to	you	--	is	up	.
 rain 	 fall 	 	is	up	.
and	all	these	species	and	income	.
 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 lodge 	 	that	i	built	here	,	three	 year 	 s 	 	before	,	was	an	empty	,	yellow	field	.
 th 	 is 	 	 trans 	 ponder 	 	that	we	 oper 	 ate 	 	with	the	european	space	 age 	 ncy 	 	--	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	benefit	that	every	satellite	that	 come 	 s 	 	over	to	calibrate	 it 	 self 	 	is	taking	a	picture	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	we	use	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	how	much	carbon	,	how	the	forest	is	 develop 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	can	monitor	every	tree	using	satellite	 image 	 s 	 	through	our	 co 	 operation 	 	.
we	can	use	these	data	now	to	provide	other	 region 	 s 	 	with	 recipe 	 s 	 	and	the	same	technology	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	it	 al 	 ready 	 	with	google	earth	.
if	you	would	use	a	little	bit	of	your	technology	to	put	 track 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	in	 truck 	 s 	 	,	and	use	google	earth	in	combination	with	that	,	you	could	 direct 	 ly 	 	tell	what	palm	oil	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 sustain 	 ably 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	,	which	company	is	 steal 	 ing 	 	the	timber	,	and	you	could	 s 	 ave 	 	so	much	more	carbon	than	with	any	measure	of	saving	energy	here	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	samboja	lestari	area	.
you	measure	how	the	 tree 	 s 	 	grow	back	,	but	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	measure	the	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	coming	back	.
and	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	is	an	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	how	much	water	can	be	 balanc 	 ed 	 	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 medicine 	 s 	 	can	be	 ke 	 pt 	 	here	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	i	made	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	rain	machine	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	forest	is	now	creating	 it 	 s 	 	own	rain	.
 th 	 is 	 	 near 	 by 	 	city	of	balikpapan	 ha 	 s 	 	a	big	problem	with	water	;	it	's	80	percent	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 sea 	 water 	 	,	and	we	have	now	a	lot	of	 in 	 tru 	 s 	 ion 	 	there	.
now	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	above	 th 	 is 	 	forest	;	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 re 	 forest 	 ation 	 	area	,	the	semi	-	open	area	and	the	open	area	.
and	look	at	these	 image 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	just	run	them	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	through	.
in	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	,	 rain 	 drop 	 s 	 	are	not	 form 	 ed 	 	from	ice	 crystal 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	case	in	the	 temper 	 ate 	 	 zone 	 s 	 	,	you	need	the	 tree 	 s 	 	with	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	 chemical 	 s 	 	that	come	out	of	the	 leav 	 es 	 	of	the	 tree 	 s 	 	that	 initi 	 ate 	 	the	 rain 	 drop 	 s 	 	.
so	you	create	a	cool	place	where	 cloud 	 s 	 	can	 accumul 	 ate 	 	,	and	you	have	the	 tree 	 s 	 	to	 initi 	 ate 	 	the	rain	.
and	look	,	there	's	now	11.2	percent	more	 cloud 	 s 	 	--	 al 	 ready 	 	,	after	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	at	 rain 	 fall 	 	,	it	was	 al 	 ready 	 	up	20	percent	at	that	time	.
let	's	look	at	the	next	year	,	and	you	can	see	that	that	trend	is	 continu 	 ing 	 	.
where	at	first	we	had	a	small	cap	of	 high 	 er 	 	 rain 	 fall 	 	,	that	cap	is	now	 widen 	 ing 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 high 	 er 	 	.
and	if	we	look	at	the	 rain 	 fall 	 	pattern	above	samboja	lestari	,	it	used	to	be	the	 dr 	 iest 	 	place	,	but	now	you	see	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	see	a	peak	of	rain	 form 	 ing 	 	there	.
so	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	the	climate	.
when	there	are	trade	 wind 	 s 	 	of	course	the	effect	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	but	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	the	wind	 stabil 	 ize 	 s 	 	,	you	see	 aga 	 in 	 	that	the	 rain 	 fall 	 	 peak 	 s 	 	come	back	above	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
so	to	say	it	is	 hope 	 less 	 	is	not	the	right	thing	to	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	make	that	 differ 	 ence 	 	if	you	integrate	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
and	it	's	nice	to	have	the	science	,	but	it	still	 depend 	 s 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	 up 	 on 	 	the	people	,	on	your	education	.
we	have	our	 farm 	 er 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
but	the	real	success	of	course	,	is	our	band	--	 be 	 cause 	 	if	a	baby	is	born	,	we	will	play	,	so	 every 	 one 	 	's	our	family	and	you	do	n't	make	trouble	with	your	family	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	 look 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	road	going	around	the	area	,	which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	people	 electric 	 ity 	 	and	water	from	our	own	area	.
we	have	the	zone	with	the	sugar	 palm 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 f 	 ence 	 	with	 ver 	 y 	 	 thorn 	 y 	 	 palm 	 s 	 	to	keep	the	 orangutan 	 s 	 	--	that	we	provide	with	a	place	to	live	in	the	middle	--	and	the	people	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	 in 	 side 	 	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	area	for	 re 	 forest 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	gene	bank	to	keep	all	that	material	 al 	 ive 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	for	the	last	12	 year 	 s 	 	not	a	single	 seed 	 ling 	 	of	the	 tropic 	 al 	 	 hard 	 wood 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	up	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 cl 	 im 	 atic 	 	 trigger 	 s 	 	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
all	the	 seed 	 s 	 	get	eaten	.
so	now	we	do	the	 monitor 	 ing 	 	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	--	from	 tower 	 s 	 	,	 satellite 	 s 	 	,	 ultra 	 light 	 s 	 	.
each	of	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	that	have	 s 	 old 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	land	now	get	a	piece	of	land	back	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	two	nice	 f 	 ence 	 s 	 	of	 tropic 	 al 	 	 hard 	 wood 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	--	you	have	the	 sha 	 de 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	 plant 	 ed 	 	in	year	one	,	then	you	 under 	 plant 	 ed 	 	with	the	sugar	 palm 	 s 	 	,	and	you	plant	 th 	 is 	 	 thorn 	 y 	 	 f 	 ence 	 	.
and	after	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	can	 re 	 move 	 	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 sha 	 de 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	.
the	people	get	that	acacia	timber	which	we	have	 preserve 	 d 	 	with	the	bamboo	peel	,	and	they	can	build	a	house	,	they	have	some	fuel	wood	to	cook	with	.
and	they	can	start	producing	from	the	 tree 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	like	.
they	have	 en 	 ough 	 	income	for	three	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
but	 what 	 ever 	 	you	do	in	that	program	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	fully	 support 	 ed 	 	by	the	people	,	meaning	that	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	adjust	it	to	the	local	,	cultural	 value 	 s 	 	.
there	is	no	simple	one	recipe	for	one	place	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	corrupt	--	that	it	's	 trans 	 parent 	 	.
like	here	,	in	samboja	lestari	,	we	divide	that	ring	in	 group 	 s 	 	of	20	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
if	one	member	 trespass 	 es 	 	the	 agree 	 ment 	 	,	and	 do 	 es 	 	cut	down	 tree 	 s 	 	,	the	other	19	 member 	 s 	 	have	to	decide	what	's	going	to	happen	to	him	.
if	the	group	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	action	,	the	other	33	 group 	 s 	 	have	to	decide	what	is	going	to	happen	to	the	group	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 com 	 ply 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	great	 deal 	 s 	 	that	we	are	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	them	.
in	north	sulawesi	it	is	the	 co 	 operative 	 	--	they	have	a	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	there	,	so	there	you	can	use	the	local	justice	system	to	protect	your	system	.
in	 summ 	 ary 	 	,	if	you	look	at	it	,	in	year	one	the	people	can	sell	 the 	 ir 	 	land	to	get	income	,	but	they	get	 job 	 s 	 	back	in	the	construction	and	the	 re 	 forest 	 ation 	 	,	the	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	 orangutan 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	use	the	waste	wood	to	make	 hand 	 i 	 craft 	 	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	get	free	land	in	between	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	where	they	can	grow	 the 	 ir 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	.
they	can	now	sell	part	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 fruit 	 s 	 	to	the	orangutan	project	.
they	get	building	material	for	 house 	 s 	 	,	a	contract	for	selling	the	sugar	,	so	we	can	produce	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	ethanol	and	energy	 local 	 ly 	 	.
they	get	all	these	other	 benefit 	 s 	 	:	 environment 	 ally 	 	,	money	,	they	get	education	--	it	's	a	great	deal	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	is	based	 up 	 on 	 	that	one	thing	--	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	forest	 remain 	 s 	 	there	.
so	if	we	want	to	help	the	 orangutan 	 s 	 	--	what	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	set	out	to	do	--	we	must	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	local	people	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	benefit	.
now	i	think	the	real	key	to	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	to	give	a	simple	answer	,	is	 integ 	 ration 	 	.
i	hope	--	if	you	want	to	know	more	,	you	can	read	more	.
