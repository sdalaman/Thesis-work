ever	since	i	was	a	little	girl	 see 	 ing 	 	``	star	 war 	 s 	 	``	for	the	first	time	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	personal	 robot 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	little	girl	,	i	 love 	 d 	 	the	idea	of	a	robot	that	 interact 	 ed 	 	with	us	much	more	like	a	 help 	 ful 	 	,	 trust 	 ed 	 	 side 	 kick 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	 de 	 light 	 	us	,	enrich	our	 live 	 s 	 	and	help	us	 s 	 ave 	 	a	 galax 	 y 	 	or	two	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	like	that	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	exist	,	but	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	them	.
so	20	 year 	 s 	 	pass	--	i	am	now	a	graduate	student	at	mit	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	the	year	is	1997	,	and	nasa	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 land 	 ed 	 	the	first	robot	on	mars	.
but	 robot 	 s 	 	are	still	not	in	our	home	,	 iron 	 ically 	 	.
and	i	remember	 think 	 ing 	 	about	all	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	that	was	the	case	.
but	one	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	me	.
 robotic 	 s 	 	had	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	about	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	,	not	with	people	--	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	in	a	social	way	that	would	be	natural	for	us	and	would	 re 	 ally 	 	help	people	accept	 robot 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
for	me	,	that	was	the	white	space	;	that	's	what	 robot 	 s 	 	could	not	do	yet	.
and	so	that	year	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	robot	,	kismet	,	the	world	's	first	social	robot	.
three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	a	lot	of	 programm 	 ing 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	other	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	--	kismet	was	ready	to	start	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	people	.
scientist	:	i	want	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.
kismet	:	scientist	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	watch	that	my	girlfriend	 g 	 ave 	 	me	.
kismet	:	scientist	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	look	,	it	's	got	a	little	blue	light	in	it	too	.
i	 al 	 most 	 	lost	it	 th 	 is 	 	week	.
cynthia	breazeal	:	so	kismet	 interact 	 ed 	 	with	people	like	kind	of	a	non	-	verbal	child	or	pre	-	verbal	child	,	which	i	 assum 	 e 	 	was	fitting	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	first	of	 it 	 s 	 	kind	.
it	did	n't	speak	language	,	but	it	did	n't	matter	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	robot	was	 some 	 how 	 	able	to	tap	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	social	 with 	 in 	 	us	--	and	with	that	,	the	promise	of	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	way	we	could	interact	with	 robot 	 s 	 	.
so	over	the	past	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 personal 	 	dimension	of	 robot 	 s 	 	,	now	at	the	media	lab	with	my	own	team	of	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 talent 	 ed 	 	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	is	leonardo	.
we	 develop 	 ed 	 	leonardo	in	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	stan	winston	studio	.
and	so	i	want	to	show	you	a	special	moment	for	me	of	leo	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	matt	berlin	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	leo	,	 introduc 	 ing 	 	leo	to	a	new	object	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	new	,	leo	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	to	make	of	it	.
but	sort	of	like	us	,	he	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	learn	about	it	from	 watch 	 ing 	 	matt	's	 re 	 action 	 	.
matt	berlin	:	 hell 	 o 	 	,	leo	.
leo	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	cookie	 mon 	 ster 	 	.
can	you	find	cookie	 mon 	 ster 	 	?
leo	,	cookie	 mon 	 ster 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	.
he	's	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	,	leo	.
cookie	 mon 	 ster 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	.
he	's	a	 scar 	 y 	 	 mon 	 ster 	 	.
he	 want 	 s 	 	to	get	your	 cookie 	 s 	 	.
cb	:	all	right	,	so	leo	and	cookie	might	have	gotten	off	to	a	little	bit	of	a	rough	start	,	but	they	get	 a 	 long 	 	great	now	.
so	what	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	through	building	these	 system 	 s 	 	is	that	 robot 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	social	technology	,	where	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	push	our	social	 button 	 s 	 	and	to	interact	with	us	like	a	partner	that	is	a	core	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 functional 	 ity 	 	.
and	with	that	shift	in	 think 	 ing 	 	,	we	can	now	start	to	imagine	new	 question 	 s 	 	,	new	 possibil 	 ities 	 	for	 robot 	 s 	 	that	we	might	not	have	thought	about	 other 	 wise 	 	.
but	what	do	i	mean	when	i	say	``	push	our	social	 button 	 s 	 	?	``
well	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	,	if	we	design	these	 robot 	 s 	 	to	communicate	with	us	using	the	same	body	language	,	the	same	sort	of	non	-	verbal	 cue 	 s 	 	that	people	use	--	like	nexi	,	our	 human 	 oid 	 	robot	,	is	 do 	 ing 	 	here	--	what	we	find	is	that	people	respond	to	 robot 	 s 	 	a	lot	like	they	respond	to	people	.
people	use	these	 cue 	 s 	 	to	determine	 thing 	 s 	 	like	how	 persuas 	 ive 	 	 some 	 one 	 	is	,	how	 lik 	 able 	 	,	how	 engag 	 ing 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	the	same	for	 robot 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 turn 	 ing 	 	out	now	that	 robot 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	new	scientific	tool	to	understand	human	behavior	.
to	answer	 question 	 s 	 	like	,	how	is	it	that	,	from	a	brief	 en 	 counter 	 	,	we	're	able	to	make	an	estimate	of	how	 trust 	 worthy 	 	 an 	 other 	 	person	is	?
mimicry	's	 believ 	 ed 	 	to	play	a	role	,	but	how	?
is	it	the	 mimic 	 king 	 	of	 part 	 icular 	 	 gest 	 ures 	 	that	 matter 	 s 	 	?
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	learn	 th 	 is 	 	or	understand	 th 	 is 	 	from	 watch 	 ing 	 	people	 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	interact	we	do	all	of	these	 cue 	 s 	 	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
we	ca	n't	 care 	 fully 	 	control	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 sub 	 conscious 	 	for	us	.
but	with	the	robot	,	you	can	.
and	so	in	 th 	 is 	 	video	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	video	taken	from	david	desteno	's	lab	at	 north 	 eastern 	 	university	.
he	's	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 collabor 	 ating 	 	with	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	scientist	 care 	 fully 	 	 controll 	 ing 	 	nexi	's	 cue 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
and	the	bottom	line	is	--	the	reason	why	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	people	just	 behav 	 e 	 	like	people	even	when	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	a	robot	.
so	 give 	 n 	 	that	key	 in 	 sight 	 	,	we	can	now	start	to	imagine	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 application 	 s 	 	for	 robot 	 s 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	if	 robot 	 s 	 	do	respond	to	our	non	-	verbal	 cue 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	would	be	a	cool	,	new	communication	technology	.
so	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	:	what	about	a	robot	 access 	 ory 	 	for	your	 cell 	 phone 	 	?
you	call	your	friend	,	she	 put 	 s 	 	her	 hand 	 set 	 	in	a	robot	,	and	,	 b 	 am 	 	!	you	're	a	mebot	--	you	can	make	eye	contact	,	you	can	talk	with	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	you	can	move	around	,	you	can	 gest 	 ure 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	the	next	best	thing	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	there	,	or	is	it	?
to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	my	student	,	siggy	adalgeirsson	,	did	a	 stud 	 y 	 	where	we	 br 	 ought 	 	human	 particip 	 ants 	 	,	people	,	 in 	 to 	 	our	lab	to	do	a	 collabor 	 ative 	 	task	with	a	remote	 collabor 	 ator 	 	.
the	task	 involve 	 d 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	looking	at	a	set	of	 object 	 s 	 	on	the	table	,	 discuss 	 ing 	 	them	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	and	relevance	to	 perform 	 ing 	 	a	certain	task	--	 th 	 is 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 surviv 	 al 	 	task	--	and	then	rating	them	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	how	 valu 	 able 	 	and	 import 	 ant 	 	they	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
the	remote	 collabor 	 ator 	 	was	an	 experiment 	 er 	 	from	our	group	who	used	one	of	three	different	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	interact	with	the	 particip 	 ants 	 	.
the	first	was	just	the	screen	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	like	video	 confer 	 encing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	next	was	to	add	 mobil 	 ity 	 	--	so	,	have	the	screen	on	a	mobile	base	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	like	,	if	you	're	familiar	with	any	of	the	 tele 	 presence 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 mirror 	 ing 	 	that	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
and	then	the	fully	 express 	 ive 	 	mebot	.
so	after	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	rate	 the 	 ir 	 	quality	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	the	technology	,	with	a	remote	 collabor 	 ator 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	in	a	number	of	different	ways	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 involve 	 ment 	 	--	how	much	 empath 	 y 	 	did	you	feel	for	the	other	person	?
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 over 	 all 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	to	cooperate	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	see	when	they	use	just	the	screen	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	when	you	add	 mobil 	 ity 	 	--	the	ability	to	roll	around	the	table	--	you	get	a	little	more	of	a	boost	.
and	you	get	even	more	of	a	boost	when	you	add	the	full	 express 	 ion 	 	.
so	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	physical	,	social	 embodi 	 ment 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
now	let	's	try	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	bit	of	 con 	 text 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	know	that	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	are	living	further	and	further	 a 	 part 	 	,	and	that	 definite 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	a	toll	on	family	 relationship 	 s 	 	and	family	 bond 	 s 	 	over	distance	.
for	me	,	i	have	three	young	 boy 	 s 	 	,	and	i	want	them	to	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	relationship	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
but	my	 parent 	 s 	 	live	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	away	,	so	they	just	do	n't	get	to	see	each	other	that	often	.
we	try	skype	,	we	try	phone	 call 	 s 	 	,	but	my	 boy 	 s 	 	are	little	--	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	talk	;	they	want	to	play	.
so	i	love	the	idea	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 robot 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	new	kind	of	distance	-	play	technology	.
i	imagine	a	time	not	too	far	from	now	--	my	mom	can	go	to	her	computer	,	open	up	a	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	and	jack	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	robot	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	grandma	-	bot	,	she	can	now	play	,	 re 	 ally 	 	play	,	with	my	 son 	 s 	 	,	with	her	 grand 	 son 	 s 	 	,	in	the	real	world	with	his	real	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
i	could	imagine	 grand 	 mother 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	do	social	-	 play 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 daughter 	 s 	 	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	and	to	be	able	to	share	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	other	 activ 	 ities 	 	around	the	house	,	like	sharing	a	 bed 	 time 	 	story	.
and	through	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	be	an	active	 particip 	 ant 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 children 	 	's	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	way	that	's	not	possible	 to 	 day 	 	.
let	's	think	about	some	other	 domain 	 s 	 	,	like	 may 	 be 	 	health	.
so	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	over	65	percent	of	people	are	either	 over 	 weight 	 	or	 obes 	 e 	 	,	and	now	it	's	a	big	problem	with	our	children	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	we	know	that	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 old 	 er 	 	in	life	,	if	you	're	 obes 	 e 	 	when	you	're	 young 	 er 	 	,	that	can	lead	to	chronic	 disease 	 s 	 	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	your	quality	of	life	,	but	are	a	tremendous	economic	burden	on	our	health	care	system	.
but	if	 robot 	 s 	 	can	be	 engag 	 ing 	 	,	if	we	like	to	cooperate	with	 robot 	 s 	 	,	if	 robot 	 s 	 	are	 persuas 	 ive 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	robot	can	help	you	maintain	a	diet	and	 exercis 	 e 	 	program	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	can	help	you	manage	your	weight	.
sort	of	like	a	digital	jiminy	--	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	well	-	known	 fair 	 y 	 	tale	--	a	kind	of	friendly	,	 support 	 ive 	 	presence	that	's	 al 	 ways 	 	there	to	be	able	to	help	you	make	the	right	decision	in	the	right	way	at	the	right	time	to	help	you	form	 health 	 y 	 	 habit 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 explore 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	in	our	lab	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	robot	,	autom	.
cory	kidd	 develop 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	robot	for	his	 doctor 	 al 	 	work	.
and	it	was	designed	to	be	a	robot	diet	-	and	-	 exercis 	 e 	 	coach	.
it	had	a	couple	of	simple	non	-	verbal	 skill 	 s 	 	it	could	do	.
it	could	make	eye	contact	with	you	.
it	could	share	information	looking	down	at	a	screen	.
you	'd	use	a	screen	 inter 	 face 	 	to	enter	information	,	like	how	 man 	 y 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	you	ate	that	day	,	how	much	 exercis 	 e 	 	you	got	.
and	then	it	could	help	track	that	for	you	.
and	the	robot	spoke	with	a	synthetic	voice	to	engage	you	in	a	 coach 	 ing 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	 model 	 ed 	 	after	 train 	 ers 	 	and	 patient 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
and	it	would	build	a	 work 	 ing 	 	alliance	with	you	through	that	 dial 	 ogue 	 	.
it	could	help	you	set	 goal 	 s 	 	and	track	your	progress	,	and	it	would	help	 motiv 	 ate 	 	you	.
so	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	is	,	 do 	 es 	 	the	social	 embodi 	 ment 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	?	 do 	 es 	 	it	matter	that	it	's	a	robot	?
is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	just	the	quality	of	 ad 	 vice 	 	and	information	that	 matter 	 s 	 	?
to	explore	that	question	,	we	did	a	 stud 	 y 	 	in	the	boston	area	where	we	put	one	of	three	 intervention 	 s 	 	in	people	's	 home 	 s 	 	for	a	period	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 week 	 s 	 	.
one	case	was	the	robot	you	saw	there	,	autom	.
 an 	 other 	 	was	a	computer	that	ran	the	same	touch	-	screen	 inter 	 face 	 	,	ran	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 dia 	 logues 	 	.
the	quality	of	 ad 	 vice 	 	was	 ident 	 ical 	 	.
and	the	third	was	just	a	pen	and	paper	log	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	standard	intervention	you	 typical 	 ly 	 	get	when	you	start	a	diet	-	and	-	 exercis 	 e 	 	program	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	was	not	how	much	weight	people	lost	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	how	long	they	 interact 	 ed 	 	with	the	robot	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	not	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	weight	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	it	off	.
and	the	 long 	 er 	 	you	could	interact	with	one	of	these	 intervention 	 s 	 	,	well	that	's	 indic 	 ative 	 	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	,	of	 long 	 er 	 	-	term	success	.
so	the	first	thing	i	want	to	look	at	is	how	long	,	how	long	did	people	interact	with	these	 system 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	people	 interact 	 ed 	 	with	the	robot	 significant 	 ly 	 	more	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	quality	of	the	 ad 	 vice 	 	was	 ident 	 ical 	 	to	the	computer	.
when	it	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	rate	it	on	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	quality	of	the	 work 	 ing 	 	alliance	,	people	rated	the	robot	 high 	 er 	 	and	they	 trust 	 ed 	 	the	robot	more	.
and	when	you	look	at	 emotion 	 al 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	it	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
people	would	name	the	 robot 	 s 	 	.
they	would	dress	the	 robot 	 s 	 	.
and	even	when	we	would	come	up	to	pick	up	the	 robot 	 s 	 	at	the	end	of	the	 stud 	 y 	 	,	they	would	come	out	to	the	car	and	say	good	-	bye	to	the	 robot 	 s 	 	.
they	did	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	computer	.
the	last	thing	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	the	future	of	children	's	media	.
we	know	that	 kid 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 be 	 hind 	 	 screen 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 tele 	 vision 	 	or	computer	 game 	 s 	 	or	 what 	 not 	 	.
my	 son 	 s 	 	,	they	love	the	screen	.	they	love	the	screen	.
but	i	want	them	to	play	;	 a 	 s 	 	a	mom	,	i	want	them	to	play	,	like	,	real	-	world	play	.
and	so	i	have	a	new	project	in	my	group	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	present	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 play 	 time 	 	computing	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	think	about	how	we	can	take	what	's	so	 engag 	 ing 	 	about	digital	media	and	 liter 	 ally 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	it	off	the	screen	 in 	 to 	 	the	real	world	of	the	child	,	where	it	can	take	on	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	real	-	world	play	.
so	here	's	the	first	exploration	of	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	where	 character 	 s 	 	can	be	physical	or	virtual	,	and	where	the	digital	content	can	 liter 	 ally 	 	come	off	the	screen	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	and	back	.
i	like	to	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	atari	pong	of	 th 	 is 	 	 blend 	 ed 	 	-	 re 	 ality 	 	play	.
but	we	can	push	 th 	 is 	 	idea	further	.
what	if	--	nathan	:	here	it	 come 	 s 	 	.	 ya 	 y 	 	!
cb	:	--	the	character	 it 	 self 	 	could	come	 in 	 to 	 	your	world	?
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 kid 	 s 	 	love	it	when	the	character	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	real	and	 enter 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	world	.
and	when	it	's	in	 the 	 ir 	 	world	,	they	can	 re 	 late 	 	to	it	and	play	with	it	in	a	way	that	's	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	from	how	they	play	with	it	on	the	screen	.
 an 	 other 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	idea	is	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 persist 	 ence 	 	of	character	 a 	 cross 	 	 real 	 ities 	 	.
so	 change 	 s 	 	that	children	make	in	the	real	world	need	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	to	the	virtual	world	.
so	here	,	nathan	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	letter	a	to	the	number	2	.
you	can	imagine	 may 	 be 	 	these	 symbol 	 s 	 	give	the	 character 	 s 	 	special	 power 	 s 	 	when	it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	virtual	world	.
so	they	are	now	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	the	character	back	 in 	 to 	 	that	world	.
and	now	it	's	got	number	power	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	here	is	create	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 immers 	 ive 	 	experience	for	 kid 	 s 	 	,	where	they	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	like	they	are	part	of	that	story	,	a	part	of	that	experience	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	spark	 the 	 ir 	 	 imagin 	 ations 	 	the	way	mine	was	 spark 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	little	girl	 watch 	 ing 	 	``	star	 war 	 s 	 	.	``
but	i	want	to	do	more	than	that	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	them	to	create	 t 	 hose 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
i	want	them	to	be	able	to	 liter 	 ally 	 	build	 the 	 ir 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 experience 	 s 	 	and	make	them	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 idea 	 s 	 	in	 tele 	 presence 	 	and	 mix 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	to	 liter 	 ally 	 	allow	 kid 	 s 	 	to	project	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	space	where	other	 kid 	 s 	 	can	interact	with	them	and	build	 up 	 on 	 	them	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	come	up	with	new	ways	of	children	's	media	that	foster	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
i	think	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	project	.
we	've	 invit 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 kid 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	space	,	and	they	think	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.
but	i	can	tell	you	,	the	thing	that	they	love	the	most	is	the	robot	.
what	they	care	about	is	the	robot	.
 robot 	 s 	 	touch	 some 	 thing 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	human	 with 	 in 	 	us	.
and	so	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	 help 	 ing 	 	us	to	 be 	 come 	 	creative	and	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	 help 	 ing 	 	us	to	feel	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	distance	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	they	are	our	 trust 	 ed 	 	 side 	 kick 	 	who	's	 help 	 ing 	 	us	attain	our	personal	 goal 	 s 	 	in	 be 	 coming 	 	our	highest	and	best	 s 	 elves 	 	,	for	me	,	 robot 	 s 	 	are	all	about	people	.
thank	you	.
