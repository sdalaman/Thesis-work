i	'll	start	with	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	muse	,	emily	dickinson	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	that	wonder	is	not	knowledge	,	 n 	 either 	 	is	it	 ignor 	 ance 	 	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	 suspend 	 ed 	 	between	what	we	 believ 	 e 	 	we	can	be	,	and	a	tradition	we	may	have	 for 	 gotten 	 	.
and	i	think	,	when	i	listen	to	these	 in 	 credible 	 	people	here	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	so	inspired	--	so	 man 	 y 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	 vision 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	when	i	look	at	the	environment	 out 	 side 	 	,	you	see	how	resistant	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	to	change	.
you	see	how	resistant	it	is	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
we	can	think	them	out	.	we	can	create	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	at	the	end	,	it	's	so	hard	to	change	a	wall	.
we	applaud	the	well	-	 manner 	 ed 	 	box	.
but	to	create	a	space	that	never	 exist 	 ed 	 	is	what	 interest 	 s 	 	me	;	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	,	a	space	that	we	have	never	 enter 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	in	our	 mind 	 s 	 	and	our	 spirit 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	based	on	.
 architect 	 ure 	 	is	not	based	on	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	and	steel	and	the	 element 	 s 	 	of	the	 s 	 oil 	 	.
it	's	based	on	wonder	.
and	that	wonder	is	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	cities	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	 space 	 s 	 	that	we	have	had	.
and	i	think	that	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	what	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	.	it	is	a	story	.
by	the	way	,	it	is	a	story	that	is	told	through	 it 	 s 	 	hard	 material 	 s 	 	.
but	it	is	a	story	of	effort	and	struggle	if	you	think	of	the	great	 building 	 s 	 	,	of	the	 cat 	 hedral 	 s 	 	,	of	the	 temple 	 s 	 	,	of	the	 pyramid 	 s 	 	,	of	 pagoda 	 s 	 	,	of	cities	in	india	and	beyond	,	you	think	of	how	 in 	 credible 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	that	was	 real 	 ized 	 	not	by	some	abstract	idea	,	but	by	people	.
so	,	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	made	can	be	 un 	 made 	 	.
 any 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	made	can	be	made	better	.
there	it	is	:	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	are	of	 import 	 ant 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
these	are	the	 dimension 	 s 	 	that	i	like	to	work	with	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	personal	.
it	's	not	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	the	 dimension 	 s 	 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	by	art	 critic 	 s 	 	or	 architect 	 ure 	 	 critic 	 s 	 	or	city	 plan 	 ner 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	these	are	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	oxygen	for	us	to	live	in	 building 	 s 	 	,	to	live	in	cities	,	to	connect	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	a	social	space	.
and	i	 there 	 fore 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 optim 	 ism 	 	is	what	 drive 	 s 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	forward	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	profession	where	you	have	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	future	.
you	can	be	a	general	,	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	,	an	economist	who	is	 depress 	 ed 	 	,	a	 music 	 ian 	 	in	a	minor	key	,	a	 paint 	 er 	 	in	dark	 color 	 s 	 	.
but	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	that	complete	 ecstas 	 y 	 	that	the	future	can	be	better	.
and	it	is	that	belief	that	i	think	 drive 	 s 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	we	have	a	kind	of	 evangel 	 ical 	 	 pessim 	 ism 	 	all	around	us	.
and	yet	it	is	in	 time 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	that	i	think	 architect 	 ure 	 	can	 thriv 	 e 	 	with	big	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	not	small	.	think	of	the	great	cities	.
think	of	the	empire	state	building	,	the	rockefeller	center	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	built	in	 time 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	the	best	of	 time 	 s 	 	in	a	certain	way	.
and	yet	that	energy	and	power	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	driven	an	entire	social	and	 politic 	 al 	 	space	that	these	 building 	 s 	 	occupy	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	am	a	 believ 	 er 	 	in	the	 express 	 ive 	 	.
i	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	a	fan	of	the	neutral	.
i	do	n't	like	 neutral 	 ity 	 	in	life	,	in	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	think	 express 	 ion 	 	.
and	it	's	like	espresso	coffee	,	you	know	,	you	take	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	the	coffee	.
that	's	what	 express 	 ion 	 	is	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	in	much	of	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	the	realm	of	the	 neu 	 ter 	 ed 	 	,	the	realm	of	the	kind	of	a	state	that	 ha 	 s 	 	no	opinion	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	no	value	.
and	yet	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	is	the	 express 	 ion 	 	--	 express 	 ion 	 	of	the	city	,	 express 	 ion 	 	of	our	own	space	--	that	 give 	 s 	 	meaning	to	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
and	,	of	course	,	 express 	 ive 	 	 space 	 s 	 	are	not	mute	.
 express 	 ive 	 	 space 	 s 	 	are	not	 space 	 s 	 	that	 simpl 	 y 	 	confirm	what	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	.
 express 	 ive 	 	 space 	 s 	 	may	disturb	us	.
and	i	think	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	part	of	life	.
life	is	not	just	an	 anesthet 	 ic 	 	to	make	us	 s 	 mile 	 	,	but	to	reach	out	 a 	 cross 	 	the	abyss	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	to	 place 	 s 	 	we	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	,	and	would	have	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	had	we	not	 be 	 en 	 	so	 luck 	 y 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	radical	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 conserv 	 ative 	 	.
radical	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	 root 	 ed 	 	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	 root 	 ed 	 	deep	in	a	tradition	.
and	i	think	that	is	what	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	,	it	's	radical	.
it	's	not	just	a	 conserv 	 ation 	 	in	 form 	 aldehyde 	 	of	dead	 form 	 s 	 	.
it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	living	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	event	that	we	are	part	of	,	and	a	story	that	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	 on 	 going 	 	.
it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	good	 end 	 ing 	 	or	a	bad	 end 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	story	in	which	our	 act 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	 push 	 ing 	 	the	story	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	way	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	i	am	a	 believ 	 er 	 	in	the	radical	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
you	know	the	soviet	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	that	building	is	the	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	like	the	old	las	vegas	used	to	be	.
it	's	about	 conserv 	 ing 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	 conserv 	 ing 	 	the	 tradition 	 s 	 	that	have	 obstruct 	 ed 	 	the	mind	in	moving	forward	and	of	course	what	is	radical	is	to	confront	them	.
and	i	think	our	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	a	 confront 	 ation 	 	with	our	own	 sense 	 s 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	should	not	be	cool	.
there	is	a	lot	of	 appreci 	 ation 	 	for	the	kind	of	cool	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	opponent	of	it	.	i	think	emotion	is	 need 	 ed 	 	.
life	 with 	 out 	 	emotion	would	 re 	 ally 	 	not	be	life	.
even	the	mind	is	 emotion 	 al 	 	.
there	is	no	reason	which	 do 	 es 	 	not	take	a	position	in	the	 ethic 	 al 	 	sphere	,	in	the	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	 myster 	 y 	 	of	what	we	are	.
so	i	think	emotion	is	a	dimension	that	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	city	space	,	 in 	 to 	 	city	life	.
and	of	course	,	we	are	all	about	the	struggle	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	that	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	world	a	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	place	.
and	of	course	,	the	 confront 	 ation 	 	of	the	cool	,	the	 un 	 emotion 	 al 	 	with	emotion	,	is	a	conversation	that	i	think	cities	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	have	 foster 	 ed 	 	.
i	think	that	is	the	progress	of	cities	.
it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 form 	 s 	 	of	cities	,	but	the	fact	that	they	incarnate	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	not	just	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	build	them	,	but	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	live	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 in 	 explicable 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	.	you	know	,	too	often	we	want	to	understand	 every 	 thing 	 	.
but	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	not	the	language	of	 word 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	language	.	but	it	is	not	a	language	that	can	be	 reduc 	 ed 	 	to	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 programm 	 atic 	 	 note 	 s 	 	that	we	can	 verbal 	 ly 	 	write	.
too	 man 	 y 	 	 building 	 s 	 	that	you	see	 out 	 side 	 	that	are	so	 ban 	 al 	 	tell	you	a	story	,	but	the	story	is	 ver 	 y 	 	short	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	we	have	no	story	to	tell	you	.	``
so	the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	the	actual	 architect 	 ural 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	which	might	be	 total 	 ly 	 	 in 	 explicable 	 	in	 word 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	 proportion 	 s 	 	,	in	 material 	 s 	 	,	in	light	.
they	connect	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 source 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	complex	vector	 m 	 atrix 	 	that	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	frontal	but	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	the	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	a	city	,	and	of	a	people	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	a	building	should	just	be	 ex 	 plicit 	 	i	think	is	a	false	 not 	 ion 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 ban 	 ality 	 	.
hand	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	computer	.
of	course	,	what	would	we	be	 with 	 out 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	?
our	whole	practice	 depend 	 s 	 	on	computing	.
but	the	computer	should	not	just	be	the	glove	of	the	hand	;	the	hand	should	 re 	 ally 	 	be	the	driver	of	the	computing	power	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	hand	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	primitive	,	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 obscur 	 ity 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	source	,	 th 	 ough 	 	the	source	is	 un 	 known 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	we	do	n't	have	to	be	 mystic 	 al 	 	about	it	.
we	 real 	 ize 	 	that	the	hand	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	by	 force 	 s 	 	that	are	beyond	our	own	 auto 	 nomy 	 	.
and	i	think	when	i	draw	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	which	may	 imit 	 ate 	 	the	computer	,	but	are	not	computer	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	can	come	from	 source 	 s 	 	that	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	not	known	,	not	normal	,	not	 s 	 een 	 	,	yet	the	hand	--	and	that	's	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	,	to	all	of	you	who	are	 work 	 ing 	 	--	how	can	we	make	the	computer	respond	to	our	hand	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	hand	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	the	computer	.
i	think	that	's	part	of	what	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	we	have	gotten	used	to	the	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	that	the	simple	is	the	good	.	but	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	.
 listen 	 ing 	 	to	all	of	you	,	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	thought	,	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	 layer 	 s 	 	of	meaning	is	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	think	we	should	n't	 s 	 hy 	 	away	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	you	know	,	brain	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	atomic	 theor 	 y 	 	,	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	 economic 	 s 	 	are	complex	complex	 field 	 s 	 	.
there	is	no	reason	that	 architect 	 ure 	 	should	 s 	 hy 	 	away	and	present	 th 	 is 	 	 ill 	 us 	 ory 	 	world	of	the	simple	.
it	is	complex	.	space	is	complex	.
space	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 fold 	 s 	 	out	of	 it 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	 world 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	it	can	not	be	 reduc 	 ed 	 	to	a	kind	of	 simpl 	 ification 	 	that	we	have	often	come	to	be	 admire 	 d 	 	.
and	yet	,	our	 live 	 s 	 	are	complex	.
our	 emotion 	 s 	 	are	complex	.
our	intellectual	 desir 	 es 	 	are	complex	.
so	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 architect 	 ure 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	see	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	mirror	that	 complex 	 ity 	 	in	every	single	space	that	we	have	,	in	every	 in 	 timacy 	 	that	we	possess	.
of	course	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	 politic 	 al 	 	.
the	 politic 	 al 	 	is	not	an	 ene 	 my 	 	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
the	 polite 	 ama 	 	is	the	city	.	it	's	all	of	us	together	.
and	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	the	act	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	even	a	private	house	,	when	 some 	 body 	 	else	will	see	it	,	is	a	 politic 	 al 	 	act	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	be	visible	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	we	live	in	a	world	which	is	 connect 	 ing 	 	us	more	and	more	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 evas 	 ion 	 	of	that	sphere	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	so	 en 	 demic 	 	to	that	sort	of	 pur 	 e 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	the	autonomous	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	is	just	an	abstract	object	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 appeal 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
and	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	with	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	is	often	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	,	to	 grappl 	 e 	 	with	it	,	to	create	a	position	that	is	beyond	our	normal	 expect 	 ations 	 	and	to	create	a	critique	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	the	 ask 	 ing 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	giving	of	 answer 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	,	just	like	life	,	the	 ask 	 ing 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	that	it	be	real	.
you	know	we	can	 simul 	 ate 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
but	the	one	thing	that	can	be	ever	 simul 	 ated 	 	is	the	human	heart	,	the	human	soul	.
and	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	so	 close 	 ly 	 	 intertwine 	 d 	 	with	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	born	 some 	 where 	 	and	we	die	 some 	 where 	 	.
so	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	visceral	.	it	's	not	intellectual	.
it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	to	us	from	 book 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ories 	 	.
it	's	the	real	that	we	touch	--	the	door	,	the	window	,	the	threshold	,	the	bed	--	 s 	 uch 	 	prosaic	 object 	 s 	 	.	and	yet	,	i	try	,	in	every	building	,	to	take	that	virtual	world	,	which	is	so	 enigma 	 tic 	 	and	so	rich	,	and	create	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	real	world	.
create	a	space	for	an	 off 	 ice 	 	,	a	space	of	 sustain 	 ability 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	between	that	 virtual 	 ity 	 	and	yet	can	be	 real 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	real	.
 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 habitu 	 al 	 	.
what	is	a	habit	?	it	's	just	a	 s 	 hack 	 le 	 	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
it	's	a	self	-	induced	poison	.
so	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	true	,	the	 cat 	 hedral 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
you	know	frank	gehry	's	 building 	 s 	 	,	they	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	be	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	in	the	future	.
so	not	the	 habitu 	 al 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	 instill 	 s 	 	in	us	the	false	sort	of	 st 	 ability 	 	,	but	an	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	is	full	of	tension	,	an	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	beyond	 it 	 self 	 	to	reach	a	human	soul	and	a	human	heart	,	and	that	 break 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 s 	 hack 	 les 	 	of	 habit 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	 habit 	 s 	 	are	 enforce 	 d 	 	by	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
when	we	see	the	same	kind	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	we	 be 	 come 	 	 immur 	 ed 	 	in	that	world	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 angle 	 s 	 	,	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 light 	 s 	 	,	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
we	think	the	world	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	our	 building 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	our	 building 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 limit 	 ed 	 	by	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	and	 wonder 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	part	of	them	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	which	is	 al 	 so 	 	the	raw	.
and	i	often	think	of	the	raw	and	the	 refine 	 d 	 	.
what	is	raw	?	the	raw	,	i	would	say	is	the	naked	experience	,	 un 	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	 luxur 	 y 	 	,	 un 	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	expensive	 material 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	the	kind	of	 refine 	 ment 	 	that	we	associate	with	high	culture	.
so	the	 raw 	 ness 	 	,	i	think	,	in	space	,	the	fact	that	 sustain 	 ability 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	future	 transl 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	raw	space	,	a	space	that	is	n't	 decor 	 ated 	 	,	a	space	that	is	not	 manner 	 ed 	 	in	any	source	,	but	a	space	that	might	be	cool	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	temperature	,	might	be	 refr 	 active 	 	to	our	 desir 	 es 	 	.
a	space	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	follow	us	like	a	dog	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	trained	to	follow	us	,	but	 move 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	of	 demonst 	 rating 	 	other	 possibil 	 ities 	 	,	other	 experience 	 s 	 	,	that	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	part	of	the	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
and	of	course	that	 juxta 	 position 	 	is	of	great	interest	to	me	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	a	spark	of	new	energy	.
and	so	i	do	like	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	 point 	 ed 	 	,	not	blunt	,	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	focused	on	 re 	 ality 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	power	,	through	 it 	 s 	 	leverage	,	to	transform	even	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	space	.
so	 architect 	 ure 	 	 may 	 be 	 	is	not	so	big	,	like	science	,	but	through	 it 	 s 	 	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	point	it	can	leverage	in	an	archimedian	way	what	we	think	the	world	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	.
and	often	it	 take 	 s 	 	just	a	building	to	change	our	experience	of	what	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	how	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	both	in	between	 st 	 ability 	 	and	 in 	 st 	 ability 	 	.
and	of	course	 building 	 s 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	are	difficult	to	change	.
and	yet	,	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	every	social	space	,	in	every	public	space	,	there	is	a	 desir 	 e 	 	to	communicate	more	than	just	that	blunt	thought	,	that	blunt	 techni 	 que 	 	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 pin 	 point 	 s 	 	,	and	can	point	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	forward	,	 back 	 ward 	 	,	 side 	 ways 	 	and	around	.
so	that	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	what	is	 memor 	 y 	 	.
so	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	my	main	interest	is	to	 memor 	 y 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	we	would	be	 amnesia 	 c 	 s 	 	.
we	would	not	know	which	way	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	,	and	why	we	are	going	where	we	're	going	.
so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	never	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 forget 	 table 	 	 re 	 use 	 	,	 re 	 hash 	 ing 	 	of	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	which	,	of	course	,	get	 accolade 	 s 	 	of	 critic 	 s 	 	.
 critic 	 s 	 	like	the	performance	to	be	 repeat 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	the	same	way	.
but	i	 ra 	 ther 	 	play	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 heard 	 	of	,	and	even	with	 flaw 	 s 	 	,	than	repeat	the	same	thing	over	and	over	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hollow 	 ed 	 	by	 it 	 s 	 	 meaning 	 lessness 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 memor 	 y 	 	is	the	city	,	 memor 	 y 	 	is	the	world	.
 with 	 out 	 	the	 memor 	 y 	 	there	would	be	no	story	to	tell	.
there	would	be	 no 	 where 	 	to	turn	.
the	 memor 	 able 	 	,	i	think	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	our	world	,	what	we	think	the	world	is	.
and	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	our	 memor 	 y 	 	,	but	 t 	 hose 	 	who	remember	us	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	not	mute	.
it	's	an	art	of	communication	.
it	 tell 	 s 	 	a	story	.	the	story	can	reach	 in 	 to 	 	 obscur 	 e 	 	 desir 	 es 	 	.
it	can	reach	 in 	 to 	 	 source 	 s 	 	that	are	not	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
it	can	reach	 in 	 to 	 	millennia	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	buried	,	and	return	them	in	a	just	and	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 equ 	 ity 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	think	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	the	best	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	silent	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 appeal 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
silence	 may 	 be 	 	is	good	for	a	 cemet 	 ery 	 	but	not	for	a	city	.
cities	should	be	full	of	 vibration 	 s 	 	,	full	of	sound	,	full	of	music	.
and	that	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	is	the	 architect 	 ural 	 	mission	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	is	to	create	 space 	 s 	 	that	are	 vib 	 rant 	 	,	that	are	 plural 	 istic 	 	,	that	can	transform	the	most	prosaic	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	and	raise	them	to	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 expect 	 ation 	 	.
create	a	 shop 	 ping 	 	center	,	a	 swimm 	 ing 	 	place	that	is	more	like	a	museum	than	like	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
and	these	are	our	 dream 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	risk	.	i	think	 architect 	 ure 	 	should	be	 risk 	 y 	 	.
you	know	it	 cost 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	money	and	so	on	,	but	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	should	not	play	it	safe	.
it	should	not	play	it	safe	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	it	 play 	 s 	 	it	safe	it	's	not	moving	us	in	a	direction	that	we	want	to	be	.
and	i	think	,	of	course	,	risk	is	what	 under 	 lies 	 	the	world	.
world	 with 	 out 	 	risk	would	not	be	worth	living	.
so	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	risk	we	take	in	every	building	.
 risk 	 s 	 	to	create	 space 	 s 	 	that	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	 c 	 anti 	 lever 	 ed 	 	to	that	 ex 	 tent 	 	.
 risk 	 s 	 	of	 space 	 s 	 	that	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	so	 dizzy 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	should	be	,	for	a	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	city	.
 risk 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	move	 architect 	 ure 	 	even	with	all	 it 	 s 	 	 flaw 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	space	which	is	much	better	that	the	ever	 aga 	 in 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 	 hollow 	 ness 	 	of	a	ready	-	made	thing	.
and	of	course	that	is	 final 	 ly 	 	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	to	be	.
it	's	about	space	.	it	's	not	about	fashion	.
it	's	not	about	 decor 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	about	creating	with	minimal	 mean 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	can	not	be	 repeat 	 ed 	 	,	can	not	be	 simul 	 ated 	 	in	any	other	sphere	.
and	there	of	course	is	the	space	that	we	need	to	breathe	,	is	the	space	we	need	to	dream	.
these	are	the	 space 	 s 	 	that	are	not	just	 luxur 	 ious 	 	 space 	 s 	 	for	some	of	us	,	but	are	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	not	about	the	changing	 fashion 	 s 	 	,	changing	 the 	 ories 	 	.
it	's	about	 carv 	 ing 	 	out	a	space	for	 tree 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 carv 	 ing 	 	out	a	space	where	nature	can	enter	the	domestic	world	of	a	city	.
a	space	where	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	light	of	day	can	enter	 in 	 to 	 	the	inner	 work 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	a	density	.
and	i	think	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	nature	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
now	i	am	a	 believ 	 er 	 	in	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
i	do	n't	like	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 building 	 s 	 	built	for	 total 	 itarian 	 	 regime 	 s 	 	.
where	people	can	not	speak	,	can	not	vote	,	can	not	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
we	too	often	admire	 t 	 hose 	 	 building 	 s 	 	.	we	think	they	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	yet	when	i	think	of	the	poverty	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	which	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	 free 	 dom 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	people	,	i	do	n't	admire	 t 	 hose 	 	 building 	 s 	 	.
so	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	difficult	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	it	.
and	of	course	,	at	ground	zero	what	else	?
it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	complex	project	.
it	's	 emotion 	 al 	 	.	there	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 politic 	 al 	 	.	there	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
there	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	.	there	's	money	.	there	's	 politic 	 al 	 	power	.
there	are	 emotion 	 s 	 	of	the	 victim 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	 mess 	 iness 	 	,	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	 difficult 	 ies 	 	,	i	would	not	have	 like 	 d 	 	 some 	 body 	 	to	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	tabula	rasa	,	 mis 	 ter 	 	architect	--	do	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	.	``
i	think	 noth 	 ing 	 	good	will	come	out	of	that	.
i	think	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	about	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	.
and	it	is	about	the	 dirt 	 y 	 	word	``	 com 	 promise 	 	.	``	 com 	 promise 	 	is	not	bad	.
 com 	 promise 	 	,	if	it	's	 art 	 istic 	 	,	if	it	is	able	to	cope	with	 it 	 s 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	--	and	there	is	my	first	sketch	and	the	last	 render 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	not	that	far	away	.
and	yet	,	 com 	 promise 	 	,	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	,	that	is	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	.
and	ground	zero	,	 de 	 spite 	 	all	 it 	 s 	 	 difficult 	 ies 	 	,	it	's	moving	forward	.
it	's	difficult	.	2011	,	2013	.	 free 	 dom 	 	tower	,	the	memorial	.
and	that	is	where	i	end	.
i	was	inspired	when	i	came	here	 a 	 s 	 	an	 im 	 migrant 	 	on	a	ship	like	 million 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	,	looking	at	america	from	that	point	of	view	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	america	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 liber 	 ty 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	dream	about	.	 it 	 s 	 	 individual 	 ity 	 	,	 demonst 	 rated 	 	in	the	 sky 	 line 	 	.	it	's	 resili 	 ence 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	the	 free 	 dom 	 	that	america	 represent 	 s 	 	,	not	just	to	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 im 	 migrant 	 	,	but	to	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	world	.	thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	i	've	got	a	question	.
so	have	you	come	to	peace	with	the	process	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	ground	zero	and	the	loss	of	the	original	,	 in 	 credible 	 	design	that	you	came	up	with	?
daniel	libeskind	:	look	.	we	have	to	cure	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	of	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	we	are	 author 	 itarian 	 	,	that	we	can	determine	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	shape	the	process	in	the	best	way	possible	.
i	came	from	the	bronx	.	i	was	taught	not	to	be	a	 lose 	 r 	 	,	not	to	be	 some 	 body 	 	who	just	 give 	 s 	 	up	in	a	fight	.
you	have	to	fight	for	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	.	you	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	win	 every 	 thing 	 	you	want	to	win	.	but	you	can	steer	the	process	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	what	will	be	built	at	ground	zero	will	be	 meaning 	 ful 	 	,	will	be	inspiring	,	will	tell	other	 generation 	 s 	 	of	the	 sacrifice 	 s 	 	,	of	the	meaning	of	 th 	 is 	 	event	.
not	just	for	new	york	,	but	for	the	world	.
chris	anderson	:	thank	you	so	much	,	daniel	libeskind	.
