my	name	is	jonathan	zittrain	,	and	in	my	 re 	 cent 	 	work	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	bit	of	a	 pessim 	 ist 	 	.
so	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	i	would	try	to	be	the	optimist	,	and	give	reason	to	hope	for	the	future	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	by	 draw 	 ing 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 it 	 s 	 	present	.
now	,	it	may	seem	like	there	is	less	hope	 to 	 day 	 	than	there	was	before	.
people	are	less	kind	.	there	is	less	trust	around	.
i	do	n't	know	.	 a 	 s 	 	a	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	could	run	a	test	here	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	ever	 hitch 	 hik 	 ed 	 	?
i	know	.	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 hitch 	 hik 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	past	10	 year 	 s 	 	?
right	.	so	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	?
it	's	not	better	public	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
so	that	's	one	reason	to	think	that	we	might	be	 dec 	 lens 	 ion 	 ists 	 	,	going	in	the	wrong	direction	.
but	i	want	to	give	you	three	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	to	try	to	say	that	the	trend	line	is	in	fact	in	the	other	direction	,	and	it	's	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 long 	 	.
so	 ex 	 ample 	 	number	one	:	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
these	are	three	of	the	 founder 	 s 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	high	school	 class 	 mate 	 s 	 	together	at	the	same	high	school	in	 sub 	 urban 	 	los	 angle 	 s 	 	in	the	1960s	.
you	might	have	had	a	french	club	or	a	debate	club	.
they	had	a	``	let	's	build	a	global	network	``	club	,	and	it	 work 	 ed 	 	out	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
they	are	 picture 	 d 	 	here	for	 the 	 ir 	 	25th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	newsweek	 retrospect 	 ive 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	tell	,	they	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	goof	 ball 	 s 	 	.
they	had	one	great	 limit 	 ation 	 	and	one	great	 free 	 dom 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 conceiv 	 e 	 	of	a	global	network	.
the	 limit 	 ation 	 	was	that	they	did	n't	have	any	money	.
no	 part 	 icular 	 	amount	of	capital	to	invest	,	of	the	sort	that	for	a	physical	network	you	might	need	for	 truck 	 s 	 	and	people	and	a	hub	to	move	 package 	 s 	 	around	 over 	 night 	 	.
they	had	 non 	 e 	 	of	that	.
but	they	had	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	,	which	was	they	did	n't	have	to	make	any	money	from	it	.
the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	no	business	plan	,	never	did	.
no	firm	 respons 	 ible 	 	,	 s 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	for	building	it	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	it	's	 folk 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	together	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	for	 f 	 un 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	told	to	,	or	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 expect 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	mint	off	of	it	.
that	 etho 	 s 	 	led	to	a	network	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	a	structure	that	was	 un 	 like 	 	other	digital	 network 	 s 	 	then	or	since	.
so	 un 	 usual 	 	,	in	fact	,	that	it	was	 s 	 aid 	 	that	it	's	not	clear	the	 inter 	 net 	 	could	work	.
 a 	 s 	 	late	 a 	 s 	 	1992	,	ibm	was	known	to	say	you	could	n't	possibly	build	a	corporate	network	using	 inter 	 net 	 	 proto 	 col 	 	.
and	even	some	 inter 	 net 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	say	the	whole	thing	is	a	pilot	project	and	the	jury	is	still	out	.
that	's	why	the	 m 	 ascot 	 	of	 inter 	 net 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	if	it	had	one	,	is	 s 	 aid 	 	to	be	the	 bumble 	 bee 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	fur	-	to	-	 wing 	 span 	 	ratio	of	the	 bumble 	 bee 	 	is	far	too	large	for	it	to	be	able	to	fly	.
and	yet	,	 myster 	 iously 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	the	bee	flies	.
i	'm	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	say	that	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	massive	government	 fund 	 ing 	 	,	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	 final 	 ly 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	bees	fly	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	they	flap	 the 	 ir 	 	 wing 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	bizarre	 architect 	 ure 	 	 configu 	 ration 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	network	 s 	 ing 	 	and	be	so	 un 	 usual 	 	?
well	,	to	move	data	around	from	one	place	to	 an 	 other 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	not	like	a	package	 cou 	 rier 	 	.
it	's	more	like	a	 m 	 osh 	 	pit	.
imagine	,	you	 be 	 ing 	 	part	of	a	network	where	,	you	're	 may 	 be 	 	at	a	 s 	 port 	 ing 	 	event	,	and	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 row 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	for	a	beer	,	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	 hand 	 ed 	 	at	the	aisle	.
and	your	 neighbor 	 ly 	 	duty	is	to	pass	the	beer	 a 	 long 	 	,	at	risk	to	your	own	 trou 	 s 	 ers 	 	,	to	get	it	to	the	destination	.
no	one	 pay 	 s 	 	you	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	just	part	of	your	 neighbor 	 ly 	 	duty	.
and	,	in	a	way	,	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	 pack 	 et 	 s 	 	move	around	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	25	or	30	 hop 	 s 	 	,	with	the	 inter 	 ve 	 ning 	 	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	are	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	data	around	 hav 	 ing 	 	no	 part 	 icular 	 	 contract 	 ual 	 	or	legal	 oblig 	 ation 	 	to	the	original	 s 	 end 	 er 	 	or	to	the	 receiv 	 er 	 	.
now	,	of	course	,	in	a	 m 	 osh 	 	pit	it	's	hard	to	 spec 	 ify 	 	a	destination	.
you	need	a	lot	of	trust	,	but	it	's	not	like	,	``	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	to	pensacola	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	``
so	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 need 	 s 	 	 address 	 ing 	 	and	 direction 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	is	no	one	 over 	 all 	 	map	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	is	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	are	all	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	together	in	a	theater	,	but	we	can	 on 	 ly 	 	see	 a 	 mid 	 st 	 	the	fog	the	people	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	around	us	.
so	what	do	we	do	to	figure	out	who	is	where	?
we	turn	to	the	person	on	the	right	,	and	we	tell	that	person	what	we	see	on	our	left	,	and	vice	versa	.
and	they	can	 la 	 ther 	 	,	rinse	,	repeat	.	and	before	you	know	it	,	you	have	a	general	sense	of	where	 every 	 thing 	 	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	 inter 	 net 	 	 address 	 ing 	 	and	 r 	 out 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	system	that	 re 	 lies 	 	on	 kind 	 ness 	 	and	trust	,	which	 al 	 so 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 delic 	 ate 	 	and	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
in	rare	but	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	a	single	lie	told	by	just	one	 ent 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 honey 	 comb 	 	can	lead	to	real	trouble	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	last	year	,	the	government	of	pakistan	 ask 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	service	 provide 	 rs 	 	there	to	prevent	 citizen 	 s 	 	of	pakistan	from	 see 	 ing 	 	youtube	.
there	was	a	video	there	that	the	government	did	not	like	and	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	it	was	 block 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	common	 occur 	 rence 	 	.	 government 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	are	often	 try 	 ing 	 	to	block	and	filter	and	censor	content	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
well	 th 	 is 	 	one	isp	in	pakistan	chose	to	 effect 	 uate 	 	the	block	for	 it 	 s 	 	 sub 	 scribe 	 rs 	 	in	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	way	.
the	way	that	you	might	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	part	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	to	declare	what	you	see	near	you	--	it	 advertise 	 d 	 	that	near	it	,	in	fact	,	it	had	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 awake 	 ned 	 	to	find	that	it	was	youtube	.
``	that	's	right	,	``	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	am	youtube	.	``
which	 me 	 ant 	 	that	 pack 	 et 	 s 	 	of	data	from	 sub 	 scribe 	 rs 	 	going	to	youtube	 stop 	 ped 	 	at	the	isp	,	since	they	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	there	,	and	the	isp	threw	them	away	 un 	 open 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	point	was	to	block	it	.
but	it	did	n't	stop	there	.
you	see	,	that	 announce 	 ment 	 	went	one	click	out	,	which	got	 reverbe 	 rated 	 	,	one	click	out	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 a 	 s 	 	you	look	at	the	 post 	 mort 	 em 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	event	,	you	have	at	one	moment	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	youtube	.
then	,	at	moment	number	two	,	you	have	the	fake	 announce 	 ment 	 	go	out	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	two	 minute 	 s 	 	,	it	 reverbe 	 rates 	 	around	and	youtube	is	 block 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	oxford	,	england	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	to	youtube	,	your	 pack 	 et 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	pakistan	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	coming	back	.
now	just	think	about	that	.
one	of	the	most	popular	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	in	the	world	,	run	by	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	company	in	the	world	,	and	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	youtube	or	google	 we 	 re 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	do	about	it	.
and	yet	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	,	the	problem	was	 fix 	 ed 	 	.
how	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
well	,	for	a	big	clue	,	we	turn	to	nanog	.
the	north	american	network	 oper 	 ators 	 	group	,	a	group	of	people	who	,	on	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	day	 out 	 side 	 	,	enter	 in 	 to 	 	a	 window 	 less 	 	room	,	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 terminal 	 s 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	email	and	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	in	 fix 	 ed 	 	proportion	font	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	talk	about	 network 	 s 	 	.
and	some	of	them	are	mid	-	level	 employ 	 ees 	 	at	 inter 	 net 	 	service	 provide 	 rs 	 	around	the	world	.
and	here	is	the	 mess 	 age 	 	where	one	of	them	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 look 	 s 	 	like	we	've	got	a	live	one	.	we	have	a	 hijack 	 ing 	 	of	youtube	!
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	drill	.	it	's	not	just	the	 clue 	 lessness 	 	of	youtube	 engineer 	 s 	 	.	i	promise	.
 some 	 thing 	 	is	up	in	pakistan	.	``
and	they	came	together	to	help	find	the	problem	and	fix	it	.
so	it	's	kind	of	like	if	your	house	 catch 	 es 	 	on	fire	.
the	bad	news	is	there	is	no	fire	brigade	.
the	good	news	is	random	people	 appar 	 ate 	 	from	 no 	 where 	 	,	put	out	the	fire	and	 leav 	 e 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 expect 	 ing 	 	payment	or	praise	.
i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	think	of	the	right	model	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 th 	 is 	 	form	of	random	 act 	 s 	 	of	 kind 	 ness 	 	by	 geek 	 y 	 	 strange 	 rs 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	just	like	the	hail	 go 	 es 	 	out	and	people	are	ready	to	help	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	model	is	 every 	 where 	 	,	once	you	start	looking	for	it	.
 ex 	 ample 	 	number	two	:	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
if	a	man	named	jimbo	came	up	to	you	in	2001	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	got	a	great	idea	!	we	start	with	seven	 article 	 s 	 	that	 any 	 body 	 	can	edit	 any 	 thing 	 	,	at	any	time	,	and	we	'll	get	a	great	encyclopedia	!	eh	?	``
right	.	 dumb 	 est 	 	idea	ever	.
in	fact	,	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	is	an	idea	so	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	stupid	that	even	jimbo	never	had	it	.
jimbo	's	idea	was	for	nupedia	.
it	was	going	to	be	 total 	 ly 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	.	he	would	pay	people	money	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	a	good	guy	,	and	the	money	would	go	to	the	people	and	they	would	write	the	 article 	 s 	 	.
the	wiki	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	so	 other 	 s 	 	could	make	 suggest 	 ions 	 	on	 edit 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	an	 after 	 thought 	 	,	a	back	room	.

if	you	do	,	it	will	be	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	by	people	who	may	have	 disagree 	 d 	 	with	the	original	decision	,	but	respect	the	 out 	 come 	 	and	work	to	make	it	stay	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	own	opinion	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	lawyer	,	i	've	got	to	say	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 invent 	 ing 	 	the	law	and	 star 	 e 	 	 decis 	 is 	 	and	stuff	like	that	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	 a 	 long 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	just	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
we	see	it	on	 blog 	 s 	 	all	over	the	place	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	2005	business	week	cover	.
 w 	 ow 	 	.	 blog 	 s 	 	are	going	to	change	your	business	.
i	know	they	look	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	.	and	 s 	 ure 	 	they	look	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	.
they	start	off	on	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 goof 	 y 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 goof 	 y 	 	blog	:	catsthatlooklikehitler.com	.
you	 s 	 end 	 	in	a	picture	of	your	cat	if	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	hitler	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	know	.	number	four	,	it	's	like	,	can	you	imagine	coming	home	to	that	cat	 every 	 day 	 	?
but	then	,	you	can	see	the	same	kind	of	 whim 	 s 	 y 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	people	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	blog	 devote 	 d 	 	to	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 portrait 	 ure 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	bucolic	meadow	with	split	-	rail	 f 	 ence 	 	.
is	that	an	animal	 car 	 cass 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	her	?	``
you	're	like	,	``	you	know	?	i	think	that	's	an	animal	 car 	 cass 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	her	.	``
and	it	's	one	after	the	other	.
but	then	you	hit	 th 	 is 	 	one	.	image	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	at	request	of	owner	.
that	's	it	.	image	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	at	request	of	owner	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 some 	 body 	 	 lamp 	 oon 	 ed 	 	here	wrote	to	the	 s 	 na 	 rky 	 	guy	that	 do 	 es 	 	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	not	with	a	legal	threat	,	not	with	an	 off 	 er 	 	of	payment	,	but	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	would	you	mind	?	``
the	person	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	that	's	fine	.	``
i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	can	build	 architect 	 ures 	 	 on 	 line 	 	to	make	 s 	 uch 	 	human	 request 	 s 	 	that	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	do	,	to	make	it	possible	for	all	of	us	to	see	that	the	data	we	 en 	 counter 	 	 on 	 line 	 	is	just	stuff	on	which	to	click	and	paste	and	copy	and	forward	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	human	emotion	and	endeavor	and	impact	,	and	to	be	able	to	have	an	 ethic 	 al 	 	moment	where	we	decide	how	we	want	to	treat	it	.
i	even	think	it	can	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	real	world	.
we	can	end	up	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	get	in	a	world	with	more	 censor 	 s 	 	--	 every 	 where 	 	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 film 	 ing 	 	you	,	 may 	 be 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	it	 on 	 line 	 	--	to	be	able	to	have	a	little	clip	you	could	wear	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	not	.	``
and	then	have	technology	that	the	person	taking	the	photo	will	know	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	person	 request 	 ed 	 	to	be	 contact 	 ed 	 	before	 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	 any 	 where 	 	big	,	if	you	do	n't	mind	.
and	that	person	taking	the	photo	can	make	a	decision	about	how	and	 whet 	 her 	 	to	respect	it	.
in	the	real	world	,	we	see	 filter 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	taking	place	in	pakistan	.
and	we	now	have	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	can	build	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	so	that	people	can	report	the	 filter 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 en 	 counter 	 	it	.
and	it	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	just	a	``	i	do	n't	know	.	i	could	n't	get	there	.	i	guess	i	'll	move	on	,	``	but	 sudden 	 ly 	 	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	 conscious 	 ness 	 	about	what	is	 block 	 ed 	 	and	 censor 	 ed 	 	where	 on 	 line 	 	.
in	fact	,	talk	about	technology	 imit 	 ating 	 	life	 imit 	 ating 	 	tech	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	the	other	way	around	.
an	nyu	 research 	 er 	 	here	took	little	 card 	 board 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	with	smiley	 face 	 s 	 	on	them	,	and	a	motor	that	just	drove	them	forward	and	a	flag	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	the	back	with	a	 desir 	 ed 	 	destination	.
it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	can	you	help	me	get	there	?	``
released	it	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	manhattan	.
they	'll	fund	 any 	 thing 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
here	is	the	chart	of	over	43	people	 help 	 ing 	 	to	steer	the	robot	that	could	not	steer	and	get	it	on	 it 	 s 	 	way	,	from	one	corner	from	one	corner	of	washington	square	park	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 ex 	 ample 	 	number	three	:	 hitch 	 hik 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	not	so	 s 	 ure 	 	 hitch 	 hik 	 ing 	 	is	dead	.
why	?	there	is	the	craigslist	 ride 	 share 	 	board	.
if	it	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	craigslist	 hitch 	 hik 	 ing 	 	board	,	 tumble 	 weed 	 s 	 	would	be	 blow 	 ing 	 	through	it	.
but	it	's	the	 ride 	 share 	 	board	,	and	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	same	thing	.
now	why	are	people	using	it	?
i	do	n't	know	.	 may 	 be 	 	they	think	that	,	uh	,	 killer 	 s 	 	do	n't	plan	 a 	 head 	 	?
no	.	i	think	the	actual	answer	is	that	once	you	 re 	 frame 	 	it	,	once	you	get	out	of	one	set	of	 s 	 tale 	 	 expect 	 ations 	 	from	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	project	that	had	 it 	 s 	 	day	,	but	now	,	for	 what 	 ever 	 	reason	,	is	 tar 	 nish 	 ed 	 	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	rekindle	the	kind	of	human	 kind 	 ness 	 	and	sharing	that	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	on	craigslist	 represent 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	can	 high 	 light 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	couchsurfing.org	.
 couch 	 surfing 	 	:	one	guy	's	idea	to	,	at	last	,	put	together	people	who	are	going	 some 	 where 	 	far	away	and	would	like	to	sleep	on	a	 strange 	 r 	 	's	couch	for	free	,	with	people	who	live	far	away	,	and	would	like	 some 	 one 	 	they	do	n't	know	to	sleep	on	 the 	 ir 	 	couch	for	free	.
it	's	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	idea	.
it	's	a	bee	that	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	flies	.
 amaz 	 ing 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	couch	 surfing 	 s 	 	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
and	if	you	're	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	no	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	no	known	 fatal 	 ities 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 couch 	 surfing 	 	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	to	be	 s 	 ure 	 	,	the	reputation	system	,	at	the	moment	,	 work 	 s 	 	that	you	 leav 	 e 	 	your	report	after	the	couch	surfing	experience	,	so	there	may	be	some	 s 	 election 	 	bias	there	.
so	,	my	 ur 	 ging 	 	,	my	thought	,	is	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	n't	just	a	pile	of	information	.
it	's	not	a	 no 	 un 	 	.	it	's	a	verb	.
and	when	you	go	on	it	,	if	you	listen	and	see	 care 	 fully 	 	and	 close 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	what	you	will	discover	is	that	that	information	is	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	you	.
what	it	's	 say 	 ing 	 	to	you	is	what	we	heard	 yester 	 day 	 	,	demosthenes	was	 say 	 ing 	 	to	us	.
it	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	let	's	march	.	``	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
