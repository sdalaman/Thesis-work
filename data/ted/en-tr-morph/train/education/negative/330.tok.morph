so	what	's	image	got	do	with	it	?
and	i	must	say	,	i	think	emeka	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	a	lot	of	subliminal	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	going	to	keep	 harp 	 ing 	 	on	some	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	have	come	up	.
but	i	'm	going	to	try	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	,	and	try	and	just	close	the	loop	with	some	of	my	personal	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	try	and	put	a	face	to	a	lot	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
so	,	africa	is	a	complex	continent	full	of	 contradict 	 ions 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	.
we	're	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	you	know	,	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
i	mean	,	we	need	a	whole	 con 	 ference 	 	just	 devote 	 d 	 	to	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	good	 st 	 ories 	 	about	the	continent	.
just	think	about	that	,	you	know	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 typical 	 ly 	 	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	the	role	that	the	media	 play 	 s 	 	in	 focus 	 ing 	 	just	on	the	negative	stuff	.
now	,	why	is	that	a	problem	?
a	typical	disaster	story	:	disease	,	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	poverty	.
and	some	of	you	might	be	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	ok	,	you	know	,	ory	,	you	're	harvard	-	educated	,	and	all	you	 privilege 	 d 	 	people	come	here	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	'	forget	the	poor	people	.
let	's	focus	on	business	and	the	 market 	 s 	 	,	and	 what 	 ever 	 	.	'	``	and	they	're	all	,	``	there	's	the	80	percent	of	africans	who	 re 	 ally 	 	need	help	.	``
and	i	want	to	tell	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	story	,	ok	?
and	it	's	the	story	of	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	africans	who	are	here	.
we	start	with	poverty	.
i	did	n't	grow	up	in	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 di 	 re 	 	,	but	i	know	what	it	is	to	grow	up	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	money	,	or	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	support	family	.
euvin	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	bellwether	 sign 	 s 	 	.
the	bellwether	for	 whet 	 her 	 	our	family	was	broke	or	not	was	 break 	 fast 	 	.
you	know	,	when	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	good	,	we	had	 egg 	 s 	 	and	 sausage 	 s 	 	.
when	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	bad	,	we	had	 por 	 ridge 	 	.
and	like	 man 	 y 	 	african	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	my	 parent 	 s 	 	could	never	 s 	 ave 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 support 	 ed 	 	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	,	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 ice 	 y 	 	.
now	,	when	i	was	born	,	they	 real 	 ized 	 	they	had	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	smart	kid	,	and	they	did	n't	want	me	to	go	to	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	school	,	which	was	free	.
and	they	 adopt 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	approach	to	education	,	which	was	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	take	me	to	a	school	that	they	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	afford	.
so	they	took	me	to	a	private	,	catholic	,	 element 	 ary 	 	school	,	which	set	the	 found 	 ation 	 	for	what	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	could	afford	it	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	not	,	i	got	 kick 	 ed 	 	out	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	every	term	.
you	know	,	 some 	 one 	 	would	come	in	with	a	list	of	the	people	who	have	n't	paid	school	 fee 	 s 	 	,	and	when	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	strict	,	you	had	to	 leav 	 e 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	your	school	 fee 	 s 	 	could	be	paid	.
and	i	remember	 think 	 ing 	 	,	i	mean	,	why	do	n't	these	 guy 	 s 	 	just	take	me	to	a	cheap	school	?
 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	you	're	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	and	you	're	sensitive	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	you	 guy 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	money	.
but	they	 ke 	 pt 	 	at	it	,	and	i	now	understand	why	they	did	what	they	did	.
they	talk	about	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
in	kenya	,	we	have	an	 en 	 trance 	 	 ex 	 am 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	high	school	.
and	there	's	national	 school 	 s 	 	,	which	are	like	the	best	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	 prov 	 in 	 cial 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
my	dream	school	at	that	time	was	kenya	high	school	,	a	national	school	.
i	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	the	 cut 	 off 	 	by	one	point	.
and	i	was	so	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	was	like	,	``	oh	my	god	,	you	know	,	what	am	i	going	to	do	?	``
and	my	father	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ok	,	listen	.
let	's	go	and	try	and	talk	to	the	 head 	 mi 	 stress 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	just	one	point	.	i	mean	,	 may 	 be 	 	she	'll	let	you	in	if	that	 s 	 lot 	 	's	still	there	.	``
so	we	went	to	the	school	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 no 	 bodies 	 	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	have	privilege	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	my	father	did	n't	have	the	right	last	name	,	he	was	 treat 	 ed 	 	like	dirt	.
and	i	 s 	 at 	 	and	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 head 	 mi 	 stress 	 	talk	to	him	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	who	do	you	think	you	are	?
and	,	you	know	,	you	must	be	 jok 	 ing 	 	if	you	think	you	can	get	a	 s 	 lot 	 	.
and	i	had	gone	to	school	with	other	 girl 	 s 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	and	who	had	 d 	 one 	 	much	,	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	i	did	,	and	they	had	 s 	 lot 	 s 	 	there	.
and	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	 see 	 ing 	 	your	parent	 be 	 ing 	 	 humil 	 iated 	 	in	front	of	you	,	you	know	?
and	we	left	,	and	i	 s 	 wo 	 re 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	i	was	like	,	``	i	'm	never	,	ever	going	to	have	to	beg	for	 any 	 thing 	 	in	my	life	.	``
they	 call 	 ed 	 	me	two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	they	're	like	,	oh	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	can	come	now	.	and	i	told	them	to	stuff	it	.
final	story	,	and	i	sort	of	have	to	speak	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
disease	.
my	father	,	who	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	 di 	 ed 	 	of	 aid 	 s 	 	in	1999	.
he	never	told	 any 	 one 	 	that	he	had	 aid 	 s 	 	,	his	fear	of	the	stigma	was	so	strong	.
and	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	one	who	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	a	nerd	.
and	i	was	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	at	the	time	,	and	they	 call 	 ed 	 	me	.	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	sick	,	the	first	time	he	got	sick	.
and	he	had	cryptococcal	 men 	 ing 	 itis 	 	.
and	so	i	went	on	to	google	,	cryptococcal	 men 	 ing 	 itis 	 	,	you	know	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	doctor	-	patient	privilege	,	they	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	tell	us	what	was	going	on	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	long	-	term	thing	.
and	when	i	went	 on 	 line 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 infect 	 ious 	 	--	read	about	the	disease	,	i	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 real 	 ized 	 	what	was	going	on	.
the	first	time	he	got	sick	,	he	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	he	had	to	be	on	 medic 	 ation 	 	that	,	at	that	time	--	diflucan	,	which	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	is	used	for	 y 	 east 	 	 infect 	 ions 	 	--	cost	30	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	pill	.
he	had	to	be	on	that	pill	for	the	rest	of	his	life	.
you	know	,	so	money	ran	out	.
he	got	sick	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	up	 un 	 til 	 	that	time	,	he	had	a	friend	who	used	to	travel	to	india	,	and	he	used	to	import	,	 br 	 ing 	 	him	,	could	get	him	a	generic	version	of	it	.
and	that	 ke 	 pt 	 	him	going	.
but	the	money	ran	out	.
he	got	sick	 aga 	 in 	 	.	he	got	sick	on	a	friday	.
at	that	time	,	there	was	 on 	 ly 	 	one	bank	that	had	atms	in	kenya	,	and	we	could	not	get	cash	.	the	family	could	n't	get	cash	for	him	to	start	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	 un 	 til 	 	monday	.
the	hospital	put	him	on	a	water	drip	for	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	,	well	,	ok	,	we	'd	better	just	try	and	take	him	to	a	public	hospital	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	he	'll	get	 treat 	 ed 	 	while	we	try	to	figure	out	the	money	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
and	he	 di 	 ed 	 	when	the	 ambul 	 ance 	 	was	coming	to	the	hospital	to	take	him	.
and	,	you	know	,	now	,	imagine	if	--	and	i	could	go	on	and	on	--	imagine	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	you	know	about	me	.
how	would	you	look	at	me	?
with	 p 	 ity 	 	,	you	know	.	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	look	at	africa	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	damage	it	 cause 	 s 	 	.
you	do	n't	see	the	other	side	of	me	.
you	do	n't	see	the	blogger	,	you	do	n't	see	the	harvard	-	educated	lawyer	,	the	 vib 	 rant 	 	person	,	you	know	?
and	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 personal 	 ize 	 	that	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	talk	about	it	in	big	 term 	 s 	 	,	and	you	wonder	,	you	know	,	so	what	?
but	it	's	 dam 	 aging 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	 un 	 ique 	 	,	right	?
imagine	if	all	you	 k 	 new 	 	about	william	was	the	fact	that	he	grew	up	in	a	poor	village	.
and	you	did	n't	know	about	the	 wind 	 mill 	 	,	you	know	?
and	i	was	just	 move 	 d 	 	.
i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	his	 present 	 ation 	 	.
he	was	like	,	i	try	and	i	make	.
i	was	like	nike	should	hire	him	,	you	know	,	``	just	do	it	!	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	point	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	.
when	you	focus	just	on	the	 disaster 	 s 	 	--	--	we	're	 ignor 	 ing 	 	the	potential	.
so	,	what	is	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	?
first	of	all	,	africans	,	we	need	to	get	better	at	 tell 	 ing 	 	our	 st 	 ories 	 	.
we	heard	about	that	 yester 	 day 	 	.
we	had	some	of	them	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	know	,	 b 	 logging 	 	is	one	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
afrigator	is	an	 aggreg 	 ator 	 	of	african	 blog 	 s 	 	that	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	south	africa	.
so	we	need	to	start	 get 	 ting 	 	better	.
if	no	one	else	will	tell	our	 st 	 ories 	 	,	let	's	do	it	.
and	going	back	to	the	point	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	swahili	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
swahili	is	spoken	by	about	50	million	people	in	east	africa	.
it	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	five	 contributor 	 s 	 	.
four	of	them	are	white	 male 	 s 	 	--	non	-	native	 speaker 	 s 	 	.
the	other	person	is	--	ndesanjo	,	if	you	're	here	,	stand	up	--	is	a	tanzanian	,	[	the	]	first	swahili	blogger	.
he	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	african	who	's	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
people	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	we	ca	n't	 whin 	 e 	 	and	complain	the	west	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	?
where	are	the	rest	of	the	swahili	 speaker 	 s 	 	?
why	are	we	not	generating	our	own	content	?
you	know	,	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	complain	.	we	need	to	act	.
reuters	now	 integrate 	 s 	 	african	 blog 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 cover 	 age 	 	of	africa	.
so	,	that	's	a	start	,	and	we	've	heard	of	all	 the 	 ir 	 	other	 initi 	 ative 	 s 	 	.
the	cheetah	generation	.
the	aid	approach	,	you	know	,	is	 flaw 	 ed 	 	.
and	after	all	the	 hoo 	 pla 	 	of	live	8	,	we	're	still	not	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	picture	.
no	,	you	're	not	.
but	the	point	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	that	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	for	us	to	 critic 	 ize 	 	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	in	the	diaspora	who	are	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	where	should	i	be	,	should	i	move	back	,	should	i	stay	?
you	know	,	just	jump	.
the	continent	 need 	 s 	 	you	.
and	i	ca	n't	 emphas 	 ize 	 	that	 en 	 ough 	 	,	you	know	.
i	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	from	a	job	with	one	of	the	top	 firm 	 s 	 	in	d.c.	,	covington	and	burling	,	six	 figure 	 s 	 	.
with	two	 pay 	 check 	 s 	 	,	or	three	 pay 	 check 	 s 	 	,	i	could	solve	a	lot	of	my	family	's	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	from	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	was	here	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 need 	 ed 	 	here	,	you	know	?
i	 prob 	 ably 	 	can	win	a	prize	for	the	most	ways	to	use	a	harvard	law	school	degree	 be 	 cause 	 	of	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	.
one	is	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	,	and	i	try	and	find	,	you	know	,	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
but	there	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	need	,	you	know	?
i	'm	a	corporate	lawyer	most	of	the	time	for	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	enablis	that	 support 	 s 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	in	south	africa	.
we	're	now	moving	 in 	 to 	 	east	africa	.
and	we	give	them	business	 develop 	 ment 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 fin 	 anc 	 ing 	 	loan	and	 equ 	 ity 	 	.
i	've	 al 	 so 	 	set	up	a	project	in	kenya	,	and	what	we	do	is	we	track	the	performance	of	kenyan	mps	.
my	partner	,	m	,	who	's	a	tech	guru	,	 hack 	 ed 	 	wordpress	.
it	 cost 	 s 	 	us	,	like	,	20	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	just	for	 host 	 ing 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	else	on	there	is	a	labor	of	love	.
we	've	 manual 	 ly 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	all	the	data	there	.
and	you	can	get	 profile 	 s 	 	of	each	mp	,	 question 	 s 	 	they	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	in	parliament	.
we	have	a	comment	function	,	where	people	can	ask	 the 	 ir 	 	mps	 question 	 s 	 	.
there	are	some	mps	who	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	and	come	back	and	ask	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 complain 	 ing 	 	about	our	 politic 	 ians 	 	.
you	know	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 account 	 ability 	 	 stem 	 s 	 	from	demand	.
you	're	not	just	going	to	be	 account 	 able 	 	out	of	the	 good 	 ness 	 	of	your	heart	.
and	we	 a 	 s 	 	africans	need	to	start	 challeng 	 ing 	 	our	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
what	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	?
you	know	,	they	're	not	going	to	change	just	out	of	 no 	 where 	 	.
so	we	need	new	 poli 	 cies 	 	,	we	need	--	where	's	that	coming	from	,	you	know	?
 an 	 other 	 	thing	is	that	these	 lead 	 ers 	 	are	a	 reflect 	 ion 	 	of	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
we	talk	about	african	 government 	 s 	 	like	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	from	mars	,	you	know	?
they	come	from	us	.
and	what	is	it	about	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	is	generating	 lead 	 ers 	 	that	we	do	n't	like	?
and	how	can	we	change	that	?
so	mzalendo	was	one	small	way	we	thought	we	could	start	inspiring	people	to	start	 hold 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	 account 	 able 	 	.
where	do	we	go	from	here	?
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	power	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	power	of	sharing	knowledge	.
and	i	'd	ask	all	of	you	,	when	you	 leav 	 e 	 	here	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	just	share	,	and	keep	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	you	've	gotten	out	of	here	going	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
the	other	thing	i	want	to	urge	you	to	do	is	take	an	interest	in	the	individual	.
i	've	had	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 conversation 	 s 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	i	think	need	to	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	africa	.
people	are	like	,	``	ok	,	if	you	do	n't	do	aid	,	i	'm	a	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	heart	liberal	,	what	can	i	do	?	``
and	when	i	talk	about	my	 idea 	 s 	 	,	they	're	like	,	``	bbut	it	's	not	 scal 	 able 	 	,	you	know	.
give	me	 some 	 thing 	 	i	can	do	with	paypal	.	``
it	's	not	that	easy	,	you	know	?
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	just	taking	an	interest	in	the	individual	,	in	the	 fellow 	 s 	 	you	've	met	,	and	the	 business 	 people 	 	you	've	met	,	it	can	make	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	africa	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	the	individual	in	africa	 car 	 ries 	 	a	lot	of	people	 be 	 hind 	 	them	.
 practical 	 ly 	 	.	i	mean	,	when	i	was	a	first	-	year	student	in	law	school	,	my	mom	's	business	had	 collapse 	 d 	 	,	so	i	was	 support 	 ing 	 	her	.
my	sister	was	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	get	through	 under 	 grad 	 	.
i	was	 help 	 ing 	 	her	pay	her	 tu 	 ition 	 	.

but	,	you	know	,	let	's	figure	out	what	i	need	you	to	do	,	what	i	need	to	do	to	help	you	out	.	``
it	was	like	,	``	where	do	you	want	to	go	?	``
and	to	me	at	that	time	university	--	i	was	at	university	of	pitts	for	 under 	 grad 	 	,	and	that	was	like	heaven	,	ok	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	what	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	kenya	.

he	was	like	,	``	why	?	you	know	,	you	're	smart	,	you	have	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	going	for	you	.	``
and	i	'm	like	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	here	and	it	's	cheap	,	and	you	know	,	i	kind	of	like	pittsburgh	.	``
like	,	that	's	the	 dumb 	 est 	 	reason	i	've	ever	heard	for	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	to	law	school	.

and	if	they	do	n't	admit	you	,	they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	are	 mess 	 ed 	 	up	.	``
and	he	built	me	up	,	you	know	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	an	 illustr 	 ation 	 	.
you	can	meet	other	 individual 	 s 	 	here	.
we	just	need	a	push	.
that	's	all	i	 need 	 ed 	 	was	a	push	to	go	to	the	next	level	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	want	to	end	with	my	vision	for	africa	,	you	know	?
a	 gentle 	 man 	 	spoke	 yester 	 day 	 	about	the	 in 	 dignity 	 	of	us	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	continent	so	that	we	can	fulfill	our	potential	.
you	know	,	my	vision	is	that	my	daughter	,	and	any	other	african	child	 be 	 ing 	 	born	 to 	 day 	 	,	can	be	 who 	 ever 	 	they	want	to	be	here	,	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	.
and	they	can	have	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 transcend 	 ing 	 	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	under	which	they	 we 	 re 	 	born	.
that	's	one	thing	you	americans	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	?
that	you	can	grow	up	,	you	know	,	not	so	good	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	move	.
just	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	born	in	 r 	 ural 	 	arkansas	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	define	who	you	are	.
for	most	africans	 to 	 day 	 	,	where	you	live	,	or	where	you	 we 	 re 	 	born	,	and	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	under	which	you	 we 	 re 	 	born	,	determine	the	rest	of	your	life	.
i	would	like	to	see	that	change	,	and	the	change	 start 	 s 	 	with	us	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	africans	,	we	need	to	take	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	our	continent	.
thank	you	.
