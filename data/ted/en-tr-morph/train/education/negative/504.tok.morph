i	thought	i	'd	begin	with	a	scene	of	war	.
there	was	little	to	 war 	 n 	 	of	the	danger	 a 	 head 	 	.
the	iraqi	insurgent	had	 place 	 d 	 	the	ied	,	an	 improv 	 is 	 ed 	 	explosive	 de 	 vice 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	side	of	the	road	with	great	care	.
by	2006	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	more	than	2,500	of	these	 attack 	 s 	 	every	single	month	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	cause	of	 casual 	 ties 	 	among	american	 soldier 	 s 	 	and	iraqi	 civil 	 ians 	 	.
the	team	that	was	 hunt 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	ied	is	 call 	 ed 	 	an	eod	team	--	 explosive 	 s 	 	 ordin 	 ance 	 	 dispos 	 al 	 	--	and	they	're	the	 point 	 y 	 	end	of	the	spear	in	the	american	effort	to	suppress	these	 road 	 side 	 	 bomb 	 s 	 	.
each	eod	team	 go 	 es 	 	out	on	about	600	of	these	bomb	 call 	 s 	 	every	year	,	_UNK_	about	two	 bomb 	 s 	 	a	day	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	best	sign	of	how	 valu 	 able 	 	they	are	to	the	war	effort	,	is	that	the	iraqi	 insurgent 	 s 	 	put	a	$	50,000	bounty	on	the	head	of	a	single	eod	soldier	.
by	the	time	the	soldier	 advance 	 d 	 	close	 en 	 ough 	 	to	see	the	 tell 	 tale 	 	 wire 	 s 	 	of	the	bomb	,	it	 explode 	 d 	 	in	a	wave	of	flame	.
now	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	how	close	you	are	and	how	much	explosive	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pack 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	bomb	,	it	can	cause	death	or	 in 	 jury 	 	.	you	have	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	50	 yard 	 s 	 	away	to	 es 	 cape 	 	that	.
the	blast	is	so	strong	it	can	even	break	your	 limb 	 s 	 	,	even	if	you	're	not	hit	.
that	soldier	had	 be 	 en 	 	on	top	of	the	bomb	.
and	so	when	the	rest	of	the	team	 advance 	 d 	 	they	found	little	left	.	and	that	night	the	unit	's	 command 	 er 	 	did	a	 s 	 ad 	 	duty	,	and	he	wrote	a	_UNK_	letter	back	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	hard	the	loss	had	 be 	 en 	 	on	his	unit	,	about	the	fact	that	they	had	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 brave 	 st 	 	soldier	,	a	soldier	who	had	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	a	time	.
and	he	_UNK_	for	not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 br 	 ing 	 	them	home	.
but	then	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	up	the	silver	lining	that	he	took	away	from	the	loss	.
``	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	he	wrote	,	``	when	a	robot	dies	,	you	do	n't	have	to	write	a	letter	to	 it 	 s 	 	mother	.	``
that	scene	 sound 	 s 	 	like	science	fiction	,	but	is	 battle 	 field 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
the	soldier	in	that	case	was	a	42	-	pound	robot	 call 	 ed 	 	a	packbot	.
the	chief	's	letter	went	,	not	to	some	_UNK_	in	iowa	like	you	see	in	the	old	war	 movie 	 s 	 	,	but	went	to	the	irobot	company	,	which	is	named	after	the	_UNK_	novel	and	the	not	-	so	-	great	will	smith	movie	,	and	...	um	...	...
if	you	remember	that	in	that	 fiction 	 al 	 	world	,	 robot 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 carry 	 ing 	 	out	mundane	 chore 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	on	life	-	and	-	death	 decision 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	 re 	 ality 	 	we	face	 to 	 day 	 	.
what	we	're	going	to	do	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	flash	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 photo 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	me	that	show	you	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	 robot 	 s 	 	used	in	war	right	now	or	 al 	 ready 	 	at	the	prototype	stage	.
it	's	just	to	give	you	a	taste	.
 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 put 	 ting 	 	it	is	you	're	not	going	to	see	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	powered	by	vulcan	technology	,	or	 teen 	 age 	 	wizard	 hormone 	 s 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	real	.	so	why	do	n't	we	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	start	 t 	 hose 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	big	is	going	on	in	war	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.	the	u.s.	 militar 	 y 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	 ir 	 aq 	 	with	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	 drone 	 s 	 	in	the	air	.
we	now	have	5,300	.
we	went	in	with	zero	 un 	 mann 	 ed 	 	ground	 system 	 s 	 	.	we	now	have	12,000	.
and	the	tech	term	``	killer	application	``	 take 	 s 	 	on	new	meaning	in	 th 	 is 	 	space	.
and	we	need	to	remember	that	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	model	t	_UNK_	,	the	wright	 fly 	 ers 	 	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	what	's	coming	soon	.
that	's	where	we	're	at	right	now	.
one	of	the	people	that	i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	met	with	was	an	air	force	three	-	star	general	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	where	we	're	headed	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	is	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 robot 	 s 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	our	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	and	these	 number 	 s 	 	matter	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	not	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	's	 robot 	 s 	 	,	but	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	 prototype 	 s 	 	and	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	's	 robot 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	course	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	technology	is	moore	's	law	,	that	you	can	pack	in	more	and	more	computing	power	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	,	and	so	flash	forward	around	25	 year 	 s 	 	,	if	moore	's	law	 hold 	 s 	 	true	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	will	be	close	to	a	billion	 time 	 s 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	computing	than	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	so	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	the	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	used	to	 on 	 ly 	 	talk	about	at	science	fiction	 convention 	 s 	 	like	 com 	 ic 	 	-	con	have	to	be	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	in	the	 hall 	 s 	 	of	power	and	 place 	 s 	 	like	the	 pent 	 agon 	 	.
a	 robot 	 s 	 	revolution	is	 up 	 on 	 	us	.
now	,	i	need	to	be	clear	here	.
i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	revolution	where	you	have	to	worry	about	the	 govern 	 or 	 	of	california	 show 	 ing 	 	up	at	your	door	,	a	la	the	terminator	.
when	 historian 	 s 	 	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	period	,	they	're	going	to	conclude	that	we	're	in	a	different	type	of	revolution	:	a	revolution	in	war	,	like	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	atomic	bomb	.
but	it	may	be	even	 big 	 ger 	 	than	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 un 	 mann 	 ed 	 	 system 	 s 	 	do	n't	just	affect	the	``	how	``	of	war	-	 fight 	 ing 	 	,	they	affect	the	``	who	``	of	 fight 	 ing 	 	at	 it 	 s 	 	most	fundamental	level	.
that	is	,	every	previous	revolution	in	war	,	be	it	the	machine	gun	,	be	it	the	atomic	bomb	,	was	about	a	system	that	either	shot	 fast 	 er 	 	,	went	further	,	had	a	 big 	 ger 	 	boom	.
that	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	case	with	 robotic 	 s 	 	,	but	they	 al 	 so 	 	change	the	experience	of	the	warrior	and	even	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	of	the	warrior	.
 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 put 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 man 	 kind 	 	's	5,000	-	year	-	old	 monopol 	 y 	 	on	the	 fight 	 ing 	 	of	war	is	 break 	 ing 	 	down	in	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 life 	 time 	 	.	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	going	around	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	all	the	 player 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	,	from	the	robot	 scientist 	 s 	 	to	the	science	fiction	 author 	 s 	 	who	inspired	them	to	the	19	-	year	-	old	drone	 pilot 	 s 	 	who	are	 fight 	 ing 	 	from	nevada	,	to	the	four	-	star	 general 	 s 	 	who	command	them	,	to	even	the	iraqi	 insurgent 	 s 	 	who	they	are	 target 	 ing 	 	and	what	they	think	about	our	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	what	i	found	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	not	just	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	but	how	 the 	 ir 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	point	to	these	ripple	 effect 	 s 	 	that	are	going	 out 	 ward 	 s 	 	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	in	our	law	and	our	 ethic 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	and	so	what	i	'd	like	to	do	with	my	 remain 	 ing 	 	time	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 fl 	 esh 	 	out	a	couple	of	these	.
so	the	first	is	that	the	future	of	war	,	even	a	 robotic 	 s 	 	one	,	is	not	going	to	be	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	an	american	one	.
the	u.s.	is	 current 	 ly 	 	 a 	 head 	 	in	 militar 	 y 	 	 robotic 	 s 	 	right	now	,	but	we	know	that	in	technology	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	permanent	first	move	or	advantage	.
in	a	quick	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	still	use	wang	 computer 	 s 	 	?
it	's	the	same	thing	in	war	.	the	british	and	the	french	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	tank	.
the	germans	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	use	it	right	,	and	so	what	we	have	to	think	about	for	the	u.s.	is	that	we	are	 a 	 head 	 	right	now	,	but	you	have	43	other	 count 	 ries 	 	out	there	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 militar 	 y 	 	 robotic 	 s 	 	,	and	they	include	all	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	like	russia	,	 chin 	 a 	 	,	pakistan	,	iran	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 raise 	 s 	 	a	 big 	 ger 	 	worry	for	me	.
how	do	we	move	forward	in	 th 	 is 	 	revolution	 give 	 n 	 	the	state	of	our	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	and	the	state	of	our	science	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	training	in	our	 school 	 s 	 	?
or	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	to	go	to	war	 increasing 	 ly 	 	with	 soldier 	 s 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 hard 	 ware 	 	is	made	in	 chin 	 a 	 	and	 soft 	 ware 	 	is	written	in	india	?
but	just	 a 	 s 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	open	-	source	,	so	 ha 	 s 	 	 war 	 fare 	 	.
 un 	 like 	 	an	 air 	 craft 	 	 car 	 rier 	 	or	an	atomic	bomb	,	you	do	n't	need	a	massive	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	system	to	build	 robotic 	 s 	 	.	a	lot	of	it	is	off	the	shelf	.	a	lot	of	it	's	even	do	-	it	-	 your 	 self 	 	.
one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	you	just	saw	 flash 	 ed 	 	before	you	was	a	_UNK_	drone	,	the	 hand 	 held 	 	 to 	 s 	 s 	 ed 	 	one	.	for	about	a	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	you	can	build	one	 your 	 self 	 	,	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	what	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	use	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
that	 raise 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 wrinkl 	 e 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	war	and	conflict	.	good	 guy 	 s 	 	might	play	around	and	work	on	these	 a 	 s 	 	hobby	 kit 	 s 	 	,	but	so	might	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	cross	between	 robotic 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 terror 	 ism 	 	is	going	to	be	 fasci 	 nating 	 	and	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 een 	 	it	start	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	war	between	israel	,	a	state	,	and	_UNK_	,	a	non	-	state	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	the	non	-	state	 a 	 ctor 	 	flew	four	different	 drone 	 s 	 	against	israel	.
there	's	 al 	 ready 	 	a	_UNK_	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	you	can	go	on	and	 remote 	 ly 	 	 de 	 ton 	 ate 	 	an	ied	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	while	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	your	home	computer	.
and	so	i	think	what	we	're	going	to	see	is	two	 trend 	 s 	 	take	place	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
first	is	,	you	're	going	to	reinforce	the	power	of	 individual 	 s 	 	against	 government 	 s 	 	,	but	then	the	second	is	that	we	are	going	to	see	an	expansion	in	the	realm	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
the	future	of	it	may	be	a	cross	between	al	qaeda	2.0	and	the	next	generation	of	the	unabomber	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	fact	that	,	remember	,	you	do	n't	have	to	 con 	 vince 	 	a	robot	that	they	're	gon	na	 receiv 	 e 	 	72	 virgin 	 s 	 	after	they	die	to	 con 	 vince 	 	them	to	blow	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	.
but	the	ripple	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	are	going	to	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	our	 politic 	 s 	 	.	one	of	the	people	that	i	met	with	was	a	 form 	 er 	 	 assist 	 ant 	 	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	defense	for	ronald	reagan	,	and	he	put	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	:	``	i	like	these	 system 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 s 	 ave 	 	american	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	i	worry	about	more	_UNK_	of	 war 	 s 	 	,	more	shock	-	and	-	awe	talk	,	to	_UNK_	 discuss 	 ion 	 	of	the	 cost 	 s 	 	.
people	are	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	support	the	use	of	force	if	they	view	it	 a 	 s 	 	_UNK_	.	``
 robot 	 s 	 	for	me	take	certain	 trend 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	in	play	in	our	body	politic	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	take	them	to	 the 	 ir 	 	logical	 end 	 ing 	 	point	.
we	do	n't	have	a	draft	.	we	do	n't	have	 decla 	 ration 	 s 	 	of	war	 any 	 more 	 	.
we	do	n't	buy	war	 bond 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
and	now	we	have	the	fact	that	we	're	 convert 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	of	our	american	 soldier 	 s 	 	that	we	would	 s 	 end 	 	 in 	 to 	 	harm	's	way	 in 	 to 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	and	so	we	may	take	 t 	 hose 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 lower 	 ing 	 	 bar 	 s 	 	to	war	and	drop	them	to	the	ground	.
but	the	future	of	war	is	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	be	that	is	,	our	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	do	n't	 mere 	 ly 	 	 re 	 move 	 	 human 	 s 	 	from	risk	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	record	 every 	 thing 	 	that	they	see	.
so	they	do	n't	just	_UNK_	the	public	:	they	 re 	 shape 	 	 it 	 s 	 	relationship	with	war	.
there	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	thousand	video	 clip 	 s 	 	of	combat	 foot 	 age 	 	from	 ir 	 aq 	 	on	youtube	right	now	,	most	of	it	 gather 	 ed 	 	by	 drone 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	a	good	thing	.
it	could	be	building	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	the	home	front	and	the	war	front	but	remember	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	taking	place	in	our	strange	,	weird	world	,	and	so	 inevit 	 ably 	 	the	ability	to	download	these	video	 clip 	 s 	 	to	,	you	know	,	your	ipod	or	your	_UNK_	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	ability	to	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
 soldier 	 s 	 	have	a	name	for	these	 clip 	 s 	 	.
they	call	it	war	porn	.
the	typical	one	that	i	was	 s 	 ent 	 	was	an	email	that	had	an	 attach 	 ment 	 	of	video	of	a	predator	strike	taking	out	an	 ene 	 my 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	,	bodies	burst	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	with	the	explosion	.
it	was	set	to	music	.
it	was	set	to	the	pop	song	``	i	just	want	to	fly	``	by	sugar	ray	.
 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	watch	more	but	experience	less	 create 	 s 	 	a	 wrinkl 	 e 	 	in	the	public	's	relationship	with	war	.
i	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	parallel	.
it	's	like	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 watch 	 ing 	 	an	nba	game	,	a	professional	 basket 	 ball 	 	game	on	tv	,	where	the	 athlete 	 s 	 	are	 tin 	 y 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	at	that	 basket 	 ball 	 	game	in	person	and	 real 	 izing 	 	what	 some 	 one 	 	seven	feet	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	look	like	.
but	we	have	to	remember	,	these	are	just	the	 clip 	 s 	 	.
these	are	just	the	_UNK_	_UNK_	version	of	the	game	.	they	lose	the	 con 	 text 	 	.
they	lose	the	 human 	 ity 	 	.	war	just	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 s 	 lam 	 	_UNK_	and	smart	 bomb 	 s 	 	.
now	the	 iron 	 y 	 	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	while	the	future	of	war	may	involve	more	and	more	 machine 	 s 	 	,	it	's	our	human	 psycho 	 logy 	 	that	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	our	human	_UNK_	that	are	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	these	 war 	 s 	 	.
so	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	big	 reson 	 ance 	 	in	the	policy	realm	is	how	 th 	 is 	 	 play 	 s 	 	out	on	our	 ver 	 y 	 	real	war	of	 idea 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	what	is	the	 mess 	 age 	 	that	we	think	we	are	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	with	these	 machine 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	what	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 receiv 	 ed 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 mess 	 age 	 	.
so	one	of	the	people	that	i	met	was	a	senior	bush	 administr 	 ation 	 	official	,	who	had	 th 	 is 	 	to	say	about	our	_UNK_	of	war	.
``	it	 play 	 s 	 	to	our	strength	.	the	thing	that	 s 	 care 	 s 	 	people	is	our	technology	.	``
but	when	you	go	out	and	meet	with	people	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	in	lebanon	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	story	.	one	of	the	people	i	met	with	there	was	a	news	editor	,	and	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	drone	is	 fly 	 ing 	 	above	him	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	he	had	to	say	.
