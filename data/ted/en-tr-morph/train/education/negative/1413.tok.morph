i	call	 my 	 self 	 	a	body	architect	.
i	trained	in	 classic 	 al 	 	ballet	and	have	a	 back 	 ground 	 	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	and	fashion	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	body	architect	,	i	fascinate	with	the	human	body	and	explore	how	i	can	transform	it	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	at	philips	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	in	the	far	-	future	design	research	lab	,	looking	20	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
i	 explore 	 d 	 	the	human	skin	,	and	how	technology	can	transform	the	body	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	like	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	tattoo	,	which	is	 augment 	 ed 	 	by	touch	,	or	 dress 	 es 	 	that	 blush 	 ed 	 	and	 shiver 	 ed 	 	with	light	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	own	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	the	low	-	tech	 approach 	 es 	 	to	the	high	-	tech	 conversation 	 s 	 	i	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	.
these	are	q	-	 tip 	 s 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	to	my	 room 	 mate 	 	with	wig	glue	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	a	friend	of	mine	,	bart	hess	--	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 normal 	 ly 	 	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	we	used	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 model 	 s 	 	.
we	 transform 	 ed 	 	our	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	,	and	 work 	 ed 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 spontane 	 ous 	 	and	 im 	 mediate 	 	way	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	creating	visual	 image 	 ry 	 	 provok 	 ing 	 	human	evolution	.
whilst	i	was	at	philips	,	we	 discuss 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	a	 may 	 be 	 	technology	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	n't	either	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	on	or	off	,	but	in	between	.
a	 may 	 be 	 	that	could	take	the	form	of	a	gas	or	a	liquid	.
and	i	 be 	 came 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 blur 	 ring 	 	the	 peri 	 meter 	 	of	the	body	,	so	you	could	n't	see	where	the	skin	 end 	 ed 	 	and	the	near	environment	 start 	 ed 	 	.
i	set	up	my	studio	in	the	red	-	light	 di 	 strict 	 	and	 obsess 	 ively 	 	 wrap 	 ped 	 	 my 	 self 	 	in	 plumb 	 ing 	 	 tub 	 ing 	 	,	and	found	a	way	to	 re 	 define 	 	the	skin	and	create	 th 	 is 	 	dynamic	 text 	 ile 	 	.
i	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	robyn	,	the	swedish	pop	star	,	and	she	was	 al 	 so 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	how	technology	 co 	 exist 	 s 	 	with	raw	human	emotion	.
and	she	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	technology	with	these	new	 feather 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	new	face	paint	,	 th 	 is 	 	 pun 	 k 	 	,	the	way	that	we	identify	with	the	world	,	and	we	made	 th 	 is 	 	music	video	.
i	'm	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	the	idea	of	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	merge	biology	with	technology	,	and	i	remember	 read 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 re 	 program 	 	biology	,	in	the	future	,	away	from	disease	and	aging	.
and	i	thought	about	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	,	imagine	if	we	could	 re 	 program 	 	our	own	body	odor	,	modify	and	 bio 	 logically 	 	enhance	it	,	and	how	would	that	change	the	way	that	we	communicate	with	each	other	?
or	the	way	that	we	attract	sexual	 partner 	 s 	 	?
and	would	we	 re 	 vert 	 	back	to	 be 	 ing 	 	more	like	 animal 	 s 	 	,	more	 prim 	 al 	 	 mode 	 s 	 	of	communication	?
i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	a	synthetic	biologist	,	and	i	 create 	 d 	 	a	 swallow 	 able 	 	perfume	,	which	is	a	cosmetic	pill	that	you	eat	and	the	 fragr 	 ance 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	through	the	skin	's	surface	when	you	 perspi 	 re 	 	.
it	 complete 	 ly 	 	 blow 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	the	way	that	perfume	is	,	and	 provide 	 s 	 	a	whole	new	format	.
it	's	perfume	coming	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	out	.
it	 re 	 define 	 s 	 	the	role	of	skin	,	and	our	bodies	 be 	 come 	 	an	 atom 	 izer 	 	.
i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	there	's	no	 bound 	 aries 	 	,	and	if	i	look	at	the	evolution	of	my	work	i	can	see	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	and	 connect 	 ions 	 	that	make	sense	.
but	when	i	look	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	future	,	the	next	project	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 known 	 	and	wide	open	.
i	feel	like	i	have	all	these	 idea 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ing 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	me	,	and	it	's	these	 conversation 	 s 	 	and	these	 experience 	 s 	 	that	connect	these	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	they	kind	of	 instinct 	 ively 	 	come	out	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	body	architect	,	i	've	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 limit 	 less 	 	and	 bound 	 less 	 	platform	for	me	to	discover	 what 	 ever 	 	i	want	.
and	i	feel	like	i	've	just	got	 start 	 ed 	 	.
so	here	's	to	 an 	 other 	 	day	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
thank	you	!
thank	you	!
