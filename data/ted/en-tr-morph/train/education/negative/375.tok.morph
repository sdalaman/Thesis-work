you	might	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	why	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	,	and	one	answer	to	that	is	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	here	to	talk	about	glamour	.
so	,	we	all	think	we	know	what	glamour	is	.	here	it	is	.
it	's	 glamor 	 ous 	 	movie	 star 	 s 	 	,	like	marlene	dietrich	.
and	it	 come 	 s 	 	in	a	male	form	,	too	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	he	shoot	,	drive	,	drink	--	you	know	,	he	 drink 	 s 	 	wine	,	there	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	a	little	wine	in	there	--	and	of	course	,	 al 	 ways 	 	 wear 	 s 	 	a	tuxedo	.
but	i	think	that	glamour	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	much	 broad 	 er 	 	meaning	--	one	that	is	true	for	the	movie	 star 	 s 	 	and	the	 fiction 	 al 	 	 character 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	other	 form 	 s 	 	.
a	magazine	?
well	,	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 l 	 east 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	magazine	on	the	 news 	 stand 	 	--	it	's	all	about	 s 	 ex 	 	 tip 	 s 	 	.
 s 	 ex 	 	 tip 	 s 	 	are	not	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
and	drew	barrymore	,	for	all	her	 wonder 	 ful 	 	charm	,	is	not	 glamor 	 ous 	 	either	.
but	there	is	a	glamour	of	industry	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	margaret	bourke	-	white	's	--	one	of	her	 picture 	 s 	 	she	did	.
fantastic	,	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	steel	 mill 	 s 	 	and	paper	 mill 	 s 	 	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 glamor 	 ous 	 	industrial	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	the	 myth 	 ic 	 	glamour	of	the	 gar 	 age 	 	entrepreneur	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	hewlett	-	packard	 gar 	 age 	 	.
we	know	 every 	 one 	 	who	 start 	 s 	 	a	business	in	a	 gar 	 age 	 	 end 	 s 	 	up	 found 	 ing 	 	hewlett	-	packard	.
there	's	the	glamour	of	physics	.
what	could	be	more	 glamor 	 ous 	 	than	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	entire	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	grand	 un 	 ification 	 	?	and	,	by	the	way	,	it	 help 	 s 	 	if	you	're	brian	greene	--	he	 ha 	 s 	 	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	glamour	.
and	there	is	,	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	glamour	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	:	the	glamour	of	 out 	 er 	 	space	--	and	not	the	alien	-	style	glamour	,	but	the	nice	,	clean	,	early	'60s	version	.
so	what	do	we	mean	by	glamour	?
well	,	one	thing	you	can	do	if	you	want	to	know	what	glamour	 mean 	 s 	 	is	you	can	look	in	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 help 	 s 	 	a	lot	more	if	you	look	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	the	1913	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	for	centuries	,	glamour	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	meaning	,	and	the	word	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	 different 	 ly 	 	from	the	way	we	think	of	it	.
you	had	``	a	``	glamour	.
it	was	n't	glamour	 a 	 s 	 	a	quality	--	you	``	cast	a	glamour	.	``
glamour	was	a	 liter 	 al 	 	magic	spell	.
not	a	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	one	,	the	way	we	use	it	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	a	 liter 	 al 	 	magic	spell	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 witch 	 es 	 	and	 gy 	 psies 	 	and	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	celtic	magic	.
and	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	around	the	turn	of	the	20th	century	,	it	 start 	 ed 	 	to	take	on	 th 	 is 	 	other	kind	of	 de 	 ception 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	definition	for	any	artificial	interest	in	,	or	 associ 	 ation 	 	with	,	an	object	through	which	it	 appear 	 s 	 	 d 	 elusive 	 ly 	 	 magn 	 ified 	 	or	 glor 	 ified 	 	.
but	still	,	glamour	is	an	illusion	.
glamour	is	a	magic	spell	.
and	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	about	glamour	 through 	 out 	 	most	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.	when	the	 witch 	 es 	 	cast	a	magic	spell	on	you	,	it	was	not	in	your	self	-	interest	--	it	was	to	get	you	to	act	against	your	interest	.
well	of	course	,	in	the	20th	century	,	glamour	came	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	different	meaning	 associate 	 d 	 	with	hollywood	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	hedy	lamarr	.
hedy	lamarr	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 any 	 one 	 	can	look	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	all	you	have	to	do	is	 s 	 it 	 	there	and	look	stupid	.	``
but	in	fact	,	with	all	due	respect	to	hedy	--	about	whom	we	'll	hear	more	 lat 	 er 	 	--	there	's	a	lot	more	to	it	.
there	was	a	tremendous	amount	of	technical	 achiev 	 ement 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	creating	 th 	 is 	 	hollywood	glamour	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 score 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 touch 	 ers 	 	and	 light 	 ing 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	and	make	-	up	 expert 	 s 	 	.
you	can	go	to	the	museum	of	hollywood	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	hollywood	and	see	max	factor	's	special	rooms	that	he	 paint 	 ed 	 	different	 color 	 s 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 complex 	 ion 	 	of	the	star	he	was	going	to	make	up	.
so	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 styl 	 ized 	 	portrait	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	earth	--	it	was	a	portrait	of	a	star	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	see	 glamor 	 ized 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	all	the	time	--	they	call	them	false	color	.
glamour	is	a	form	of	 fals 	 ification 	 	,	but	 fals 	 ification 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	purpose	.
it	may	be	to	illuminate	the	star	;	it	may	be	to	sell	a	film	.
and	it	 involve 	 s 	 	a	great	deal	of	 techni 	 que 	 	.
it	's	not	--	glamour	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	--	you	do	n't	wake	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.	i	do	n't	care	who	you	are	.
even	nicole	kidman	 do 	 es 	 	n't	wake	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
there	is	a	process	of	``	 ideal 	 ization 	 	,	 glor 	 ification 	 	and	 dramat 	 ization 	 	,	``	and	it	's	not	just	the	case	for	people	.
glamour	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	people	.
 architect 	 ural 	 	 photograph 	 y 	 	--	julius	schulman	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 trans 	 figur 	 ation 	 	,	took	 th 	 is 	 	fabulous	,	famous	picture	of	the	kauffman	house	.
 architect 	 ural 	 	 photograph 	 y 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
it	 put 	 s 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	special	,	special	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	alex	ross	's	 com 	 ic 	 	book	art	,	which	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	realistic	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	his	style	is	he	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	kind	of	 real 	 ism 	 	in	his	 com 	 ic 	 	art	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	that	light	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 th 	 is 	 	way	in	the	real	world	.
when	you	stack	people	in	 row 	 s 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	look	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	 one 	 s 	 	in	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	--	but	not	in	the	world	of	glamour	.
what	glamour	is	all	about	--	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	from	a	 blur 	 b 	 	in	the	table	of	 content 	 s 	 	of	new	york	magazine	,	which	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	that	glamour	is	back	--	glamour	is	all	about	 transcend 	 ing 	 	the	 every 	 day 	 	.
and	i	think	that	that	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	at	what	the	core	that	 combine 	 s 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	glamour	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	filippino	lippi	's	1543	portrait	of	saint	apollonia	.
and	i	do	n't	know	who	she	is	either	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	[	16th	]	century	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	a	 super 	 model 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	portrait	.
why	is	it	 glamor 	 ous 	 	?
it	's	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	first	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	--	but	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	make	you	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	you	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
she	is	 grace 	 ful 	 	,	she	is	 myster 	 ious 	 	and	she	is	 transcend 	 ent 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	central	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	glamour	.
you	do	n't	see	her	 eye 	 s 	 	;	they	're	looking	 down 	 ward 	 	.
she	's	not	looking	away	from	you	 exact 	 ly 	 	,	but	you	have	to	 ment 	 ally 	 	imagine	her	world	.
she	's	 encourag 	 ing 	 	you	to	 contempl 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 high 	 er 	 	world	to	which	she	 belong 	 s 	 	,	where	she	can	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	tranquil	while	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	iron	 instrument 	 s 	 	of	her	death	by	torture	.
mel	gibson	's	``	 pass 	 ion 	 	of	the	christ	``	--	not	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
that	's	glamour	:	that	's	michelangelo	's	``	pieta	,	``	where	mary	is	the	same	age	 a 	 s 	 	jesus	and	they	're	both	 awful 	 ly 	 	happy	and	 pleas 	 ant 	 	.
glamour	 invit 	 es 	 	us	to	live	in	a	different	world	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	be	 myster 	 ious 	 	,	a	little	bit	 di 	 stant 	 	--	that	's	why	,	often	in	these	glamour	 shot 	 s 	 	,	the	person	is	not	looking	at	the	audience	,	it	's	why	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	are	 glamor 	 ous 	 	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	not	so	far	above	us	that	we	ca	n't	identify	with	the	person	.
in	some	sense	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	like	us	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	in	religious	art	,	you	know	,	god	is	not	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
god	can	not	be	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	god	is	 omni 	 potent 	 	,	 omni 	 scient 	 	--	too	far	above	us	.
and	yet	you	will	see	in	religious	art	,	 saint 	 s 	 	or	the	virgin	mary	will	often	be	 port 	 ray 	 ed 	 	--	not	 al 	 ways 	 	--	in	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 form 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	glamour	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	to	be	about	people	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	 transcend 	 ent 	 	quality	.
what	is	it	about	 super 	 man 	 	?
 a 	 side 	 	from	alex	ross	's	style	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	one	thing	about	 super 	 man 	 	is	he	 make 	 s 	 	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	a	man	can	fly	.
glamour	is	all	about	 transcend 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	and	 get 	 ting 	 	to	an	 ideal 	 ized 	 	,	perfect	place	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	reason	that	 mode 	 s 	 	of	 transport 	 ation 	 	tend	to	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
the	less	experience	we	have	with	them	,	the	more	 glamor 	 ous 	 	they	are	.
so	you	can	do	a	 glamor 	 ized 	 	picture	of	a	car	,	but	you	ca	n't	do	a	 glamor 	 ized 	 	picture	of	traffic	.
you	can	do	a	 glamor 	 ized 	 	picture	of	an	 air 	 plane 	 	,	but	not	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
the	 not 	 ion 	 	is	that	it	's	going	to	transport	you	,	and	the	story	is	not	about	,	you	know	,	the	guy	in	front	of	you	in	the	 air 	 plane 	 	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	nasty	little	kid	,	or	the	big	cough	.
the	story	is	about	where	you	're	 arriv 	 ing 	 	,	or	 think 	 ing 	 	about	where	you	're	 arriv 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 transport 	 ed 	 	is	one	reason	that	we	have	glamour	 styl 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 stream 	 lining 	 	 styl 	 ing 	 	is	not	just	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	associate	it	with	 movie 	 s 	 	of	that	period	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	it	's	 stream 	 lining 	 	,	it	 transport 	 s 	 	us	from	the	 every 	 day 	 	.
the	same	thing	--	 arche 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
 arche 	 s 	 	with	 stain 	 ed 	 	glass	--	even	more	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
 stair 	 case 	 s 	 	that	 curv 	 e 	 	away	from	you	are	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
i	happen	to	find	that	 part 	 icular 	 	 stair 	 case 	 	picture	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	to	me	,	it	 capture 	 s 	 	the	whole	promise	of	the	academic	 contempl 	 ative 	 	life	--	but	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	i	went	to	princeton	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	 sky 	 lines 	 	are	super	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	city	 street 	 s 	 	--	not	so	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
you	know	,	when	you	get	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	town	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
the	horizon	,	the	open	road	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
there	are	few	 thing 	 s 	 	more	 glamor 	 ous 	 	than	the	horizon	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	,	possibly	,	 multi 	 ple 	 	 horizon 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	here	you	do	n't	feel	the	cold	,	or	the	heat	--	you	just	see	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
in	order	to	pull	glamour	off	,	you	need	 th 	 is 	 	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	quality	of	sprezzatura	,	which	is	a	term	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	by	castiglione	in	his	book	,	``	the	book	of	the	courtier	.	``
there	's	the	not	-	 glamor 	 ous 	 	version	of	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 to 	 day 	 	,	after	a	few	centuries	.
and	sprezzatura	is	the	art	that	 conceal 	 s 	 	art	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	look	 effort 	 less 	 	.
you	do	n't	think	about	how	nicole	kidman	is	 maneuver 	 ing 	 	that	dress	--	she	just	 look 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	natural	.
and	i	remember	 read 	 ing 	 	,	after	the	lara	croft	 movie 	 s 	 	,	how	angelina	jolie	would	go	home	 complete 	 ly 	 	black	and	blue	.
of	course	,	they	 cover 	 ed 	 	that	with	make	-	up	,	 be 	 cause 	 	lara	croft	did	all	 t 	 hose 	 	same	 stunt 	 s 	 	--	but	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	black	and	blue	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 ha 	 s 	 	sprezzatura	.
``	to	conceal	all	art	and	make	 what 	 ever 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	or	 s 	 aid 	 	appear	to	be	 with 	 out 	 	effort	``	:	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	critical	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	glamour	.
glamour	is	about	 edit 	 ing 	 	.
how	do	you	create	the	sense	of	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	the	sense	of	 evo 	 king 	 	a	perfect	world	?
the	sense	of	,	you	know	,	life	could	be	better	,	i	could	join	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	could	be	a	perfect	person	,	i	could	join	 th 	 is 	 	perfect	world	.
we	do	n't	tell	you	all	the	 grub 	 by 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 kind 	 ly 	 	lent	to	me	by	jeff	bezos	,	from	last	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 under 	 neath 	 	jeff	's	desk	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	real	world	of	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 lamp 	 s 	 	,	 electric 	 al 	 	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	,	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
but	if	you	look	in	a	catalog	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	a	catalog	of	modern	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 object 	 s 	 	for	your	home	--	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	are	no	 cord 	 s 	 	.
look	next	time	you	get	these	 catalog 	 s 	 	in	your	mail	--	you	can	 usual 	 ly 	 	figure	out	where	they	hid	the	cord	.
but	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 th 	 is 	 	illusion	that	if	you	buy	 th 	 is 	 	lamp	,	you	will	live	in	a	world	 with 	 out 	 	 cord 	 s 	 	.
and	the	same	thing	is	true	of	,	if	you	buy	 th 	 is 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	or	you	buy	 th 	 is 	 	computer	--	and	even	in	these	 wire 	 less 	 	 era 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	get	to	live	in	the	world	 with 	 out 	 	 cord 	 s 	 	.
you	have	to	have	 myster 	 y 	 	and	you	have	to	have	grace	.
and	there	she	is	--	grace	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 glamor 	 ous 	 	picture	,	i	think	,	ever	.
part	of	the	thing	is	that	,	in	``	rear	window	,	``	the	question	is	,	is	she	too	 glamor 	 ous 	 	to	live	in	his	world	?
and	the	answer	is	no	,	but	of	course	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	just	a	movie	.
here	's	hedy	lamarr	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	head	 cover 	 ing 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	like	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	,	it	 conceal 	 s 	 	and	 reveal 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
 tran 	 slucence 	 	is	 glamor 	 ous 	 	--	that	's	why	all	these	people	wear	 pearl 	 s 	 	.
it	's	why	 bar 	 ware 	 	is	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.	glamour	is	 trans 	 lu 	 cent 	 	--	not	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	not	 opa 	 que 	 	.
it	 invit 	 es 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	us	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	clear	picture	.
and	i	think	if	grace	kelly	is	the	most	 glamor 	 ous 	 	person	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	spiral	 stair 	 case 	 	with	glass	block	may	be	the	most	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 in 	 terior 	 	shot	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	spiral	 stair 	 case 	 	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	that	sense	of	going	up	and	away	,	and	yet	you	never	think	about	how	you	would	 re 	 ally 	 	trip	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	going	down	.
and	of	course	glass	block	 ha 	 s 	 	that	sense	of	 tran 	 slucence 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	session	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	about	 pur 	 e 	 	pleasure	but	glamour	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 part 	 ly 	 	about	meaning	.
all	 individual 	 s 	 	and	all	 culture 	 s 	 	have	 ideal 	 s 	 	that	can	not	possibly	be	 real 	 ized 	 	in	 re 	 ality 	 	.
they	have	 contradict 	 ions 	 	,	they	 up 	 hold 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	that	are	 in 	 commen 	 sur 	 able 	 	with	each	other	--	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	--	and	yet	these	 ideal 	 s 	 	give	meaning	and	purpose	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
and	the	way	we	deal	with	that	is	we	 dis 	 place 	 	them	--	we	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	 gold 	 en 	 	world	,	an	 imagin 	 ed 	 	world	,	an	age	of	heroes	,	the	world	to	come	.
and	in	the	life	of	an	individual	,	we	often	associate	that	with	some	object	.
the	white	 pick 	 et 	 	 f 	 ence 	 	,	the	perfect	house	.
the	perfect	kitchen	--	no	 bill 	 s 	 	on	the	counter	in	the	perfect	kitchen	.
you	know	,	you	buy	that	viking	range	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	your	kitchen	will	look	like	.
the	perfect	love	life	--	 symbol 	 ized 	 	by	the	perfect	 neck 	 lace 	 	,	the	perfect	diamond	ring	.
the	perfect	 get 	 away 	 	in	your	perfect	car	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 terior 	 	design	firm	that	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	utopia	.
the	perfect	 off 	 ice 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	no	 cord 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	tell	.
and	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	no	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	a	thing	like	my	 off 	 ice 	 	.
i	mean	,	there	's	no	paper	on	the	desk	.
we	want	 th 	 is 	 	 gold 	 en 	 	world	.
and	some	people	get	rich	 en 	 ough 	 	,	and	if	they	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 ideal 	 s 	 	--	in	a	sort	of	domestic	sense	,	they	get	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	perfect	world	.
dean	koontz	built	 th 	 is 	 	fabulous	home	theater	,	which	is	--	i	do	n't	think	 accident 	 ally 	 	--	in	art	deco	style	.
that	 symbol 	 ize 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 be 	 ing 	 	safe	and	at	home	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 al 	 ways 	 	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	is	your	perfect	world	?
what	is	your	ideal	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	out	?
is	it	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
``	the	 m 	 atrix 	 	``	is	a	movie	that	is	all	about	glamour	.
i	could	do	a	whole	talk	on	``	the	 m 	 atrix 	 	``	and	glamour	.
it	was	 critic 	 ized 	 	for	 glamor 	 izing 	 	violence	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	look	--	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	long	 coat 	 s 	 	,	and	,	of	course	,	they	could	walk	up	 wall 	 s 	 	and	do	all	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 im 	 possible 	 	in	the	real	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	margaret	bourke	-	white	photo	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	.	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
i	mean	,	look	how	happy	the	people	are	,	and	good	-	looking	too	.
you	know	,	we	're	 march 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	utopia	.
i	'm	not	a	fan	of	peta	,	but	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	ad	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	your	coat	's	not	so	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	out	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	's	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	 remember 	 ing 	 	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	out	is	 think 	 ing 	 	,	are	the	 ideal 	 s 	 	good	?
 be 	 cause 	 	glamour	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 total 	 itarian 	 	and	deceptive	.
and	it	's	not	just	a	matter	of	 glamor 	 izing 	 	 clean 	 ing 	 	your	floor	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	``	triumph	of	the	will	``	--	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 edit 	 ing 	 	to	cut	together	 thing 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	glamour	shot	.
national	 social 	 ism 	 	is	all	about	glamour	.
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	aesthetic	 ideo 	 logy 	 	.
it	was	all	about	 clean 	 ing 	 	up	germany	,	and	the	west	,	and	the	world	,	and	 rid 	 d 	 ing 	 	it	of	 any 	 thing 	 	 un 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
so	glamour	can	be	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
i	think	glamour	 ha 	 s 	 	a	genuine	appeal	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	genuine	value	.
i	'm	not	against	glamour	.
but	there	's	a	kind	of	wonder	in	the	stuff	that	 get 	 s 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	away	in	the	 cord 	 s 	 	of	life	.
and	there	is	both	a	way	to	avoid	the	 danger 	 s 	 	of	glamour	and	a	way	to	 broad 	 en 	 	your	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	it	.
and	that	's	to	take	isaac	mizrahi	's	 ad 	 vice 	 	and	confront	the	 manipul 	 ation 	 	of	it	all	,	and	sort	of	admit	that	 manipul 	 ation 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	enjoy	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	enjoy	how	it	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	hedy	lamarr	.
she	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	but	,	you	know	,	she	 invent 	 ed 	 	spread	-	spectrum	technology	.
so	she	's	even	more	 glamor 	 ous 	 	if	you	know	that	she	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	stupid	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	she	thought	she	could	look	stupid	.
david	hockney	 talk 	 s 	 	about	how	the	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	is	 height 	 ened 	 	if	you	think	about	the	fact	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	to	paint	 th 	 is 	 	splash	,	which	 on 	 ly 	 	took	a	fraction	of	a	second	to	happen	.
there	is	a	book	out	in	the	 book 	 store 	 	--	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 sym 	 phony 	 	in	steel	,	``	and	it	's	about	the	stuff	that	's	 hid 	 den 	 	under	the	skin	of	the	disney	center	.
and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 fasci 	 nation 	 	.
it	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	but	 unveil 	 ing 	 	the	glamour	 ha 	 s 	 	an	appeal	.
there	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 crown 	 s 	 	``	that	's	all	these	glamour	 picture 	 s 	 	of	black	women	in	 the 	 ir 	 	church	 hat 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	a	quote	from	one	of	these	women	,	and	she	 talk 	 s 	 	about	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	a	little	girl	,	i	'd	admire	women	at	church	with	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 hat 	 s 	 	.
they	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 doll 	 s 	 	,	like	they	'd	just	 steppe 	 d 	 	out	of	a	magazine	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	 k 	 new 	 	how	hard	they	 work 	 ed 	 	all	week	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	under	 t 	 hose 	 	 hat 	 s 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	joy	and	a	lot	of	sorrow	.	``
and	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	get	more	 appreci 	 ation 	 	for	glamour	when	you	 real 	 ize 	 	what	went	 in 	 to 	 	creating	it	.
thank	you	.
