the	national	portrait	 gall 	 ery 	 	is	the	place	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	 present 	 ing 	 	great	american	 live 	 s 	 	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 	people	.
and	that	's	what	it	's	about	.
we	use	 portrait 	 ure 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	to	deliver	 t 	 hose 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	that	's	it	.
and	so	i	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	the	 paint 	 ed 	 	portrait	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	a	program	i	 start 	 ed 	 	there	,	which	,	from	my	point	of	view	,	is	the	 proud 	 est 	 	thing	i	did	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	worry	about	the	fact	that	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 portrait 	 s 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	they	're	 amaz 	 ing 	 	people	,	and	we	want	to	deliver	them	to	future	 generation 	 s 	 	.
so	,	how	do	we	do	that	?
and	so	i	came	up	with	the	idea	of	the	living	self	-	portrait	 s 	 eries 	 	.
and	the	living	self	-	portrait	 s 	 eries 	 	was	the	idea	of	 bas 	 ically 	 	my	 be 	 ing 	 	a	brush	in	the	hand	of	 amaz 	 ing 	 	people	who	would	come	and	i	would	interview	.
and	so	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	,	not	so	much	give	you	the	great	 hit 	 s 	 	of	that	program	,	 a 	 s 	 	to	give	you	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 not 	 ion 	 	of	how	you	 en 	 counter 	 	people	in	that	kind	of	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	what	you	try	to	find	out	about	them	,	and	when	people	deliver	and	when	they	do	n't	and	why	.
now	,	i	had	two	 pre 	 condition 	 s 	 	.
one	was	that	they	be	american	.
that	's	just	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	the	nature	of	the	national	portrait	 gall 	 ery 	 	,	it	's	 create 	 d 	 	to	look	at	american	 live 	 s 	 	.
that	was	easy	,	but	then	i	made	the	decision	,	that	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	people	of	a	certain	age	,	which	at	that	point	,	when	i	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	program	,	 seem 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	old	.
 six 	 ties 	 	,	 seven 	 ties 	 	,	 eight 	 ies 	 	and	 nine 	 ties 	 	.
for	obvious	 reason 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	that	old	 any 	 more 	 	to	me	.
and	why	did	i	do	that	?
well	,	for	one	thing	,	we	're	a	youth	-	 obsess 	 ed 	 	culture	.
and	i	thought	 re 	 ally 	 	what	we	need	is	an	 elder 	 s 	 	program	to	just	 s 	 it 	 	at	the	feet	of	 amaz 	 ing 	 	people	and	hear	them	talk	.
but	the	second	part	of	it	--	and	the	 old 	 er 	 	i	get	,	the	more	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	i	am	that	that	's	true	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	what	people	will	say	when	they	know	how	the	story	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	.
that	's	the	one	advantage	that	 old 	 er 	 	people	have	.
well	,	they	have	other	,	little	bit	of	advantage	,	but	they	 al 	 so 	 	have	some	 dis 	 advantage 	 s 	 	,	but	the	one	thing	they	or	we	have	is	that	we	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	point	in	life	where	we	know	how	the	story	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	.
so	,	we	can	then	go	back	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	if	we	've	got	an	 interview 	 er 	 	who	 get 	 s 	 	that	,	and	begin	to	reflect	on	how	we	got	there	.
all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 accident 	 s 	 	that	wound	up	creating	the	life	narrative	that	we	 inherit 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	i	thought	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	,	what	is	it	going	to	take	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	work	?
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 interview 	 s 	 	.	we	know	them	.
there	are	the	journalist	 interview 	 s 	 	,	which	are	the	 interrog 	 ation 	 	that	is	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 what 	 	against	 resist 	 ance 	 	and	 ca 	 gi 	 ness 	 	on	the	part	of	the	 interview 	 ee 	 	.
then	there	's	the	 celebr 	 ity 	 	interview	,	where	it	's	more	 import 	 ant 	 	who	's	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	question	than	who	 answer 	 s 	 	.
that	's	barbara	walters	and	 other 	 s 	 	like	that	,	and	we	like	that	.
that	's	frost	-	nixon	,	where	frost	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	nixon	in	that	process	.
fair	 en 	 ough 	 	.
but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	 interview 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	different	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 lat 	 er 	 	thought	of	it	,	 empath 	 ic 	 	,	which	is	to	say	,	to	feel	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	and	to	be	an	agent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	self	-	 revel 	 ation 	 	.
by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	public	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	not	an	 or 	 al 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	program	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	all	about	300	people	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	the	feet	of	 th 	 is 	 	individual	,	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	me	be	the	brush	in	 the 	 ir 	 	self	-	portrait	.
now	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	i	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	at	that	.
i	did	n't	know	it	coming	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	reason	i	 re 	 ally 	 	know	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	one	interview	i	did	with	senator	william	fulbright	,	and	that	was	six	 month 	 s 	 	after	he	'd	had	a	stroke	.
and	he	had	never	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	public	since	that	point	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	not	a	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	stroke	,	but	it	did	affect	his	 s 	 peaking 	 	and	so	forth	.
and	i	thought	it	was	worth	a	chance	,	he	thought	it	was	worth	a	chance	,	and	so	we	got	up	on	the	stage	,	and	we	had	an	hour	conversation	about	his	life	,	and	after	that	a	woman	 rush 	 ed 	 	up	to	me	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	did	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	where	did	you	train	 a 	 s 	 	a	doctor	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	no	training	 a 	 s 	 	a	doctor	.	i	never	 claim 	 ed 	 	that	.	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	weird	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
when	he	 start 	 ed 	 	a	sentence	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	the	early	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	interview	,	and	 pause 	 d 	 	,	you	 g 	 ave 	 	him	the	word	,	the	bridge	to	get	to	the	end	of	the	sentence	,	and	by	the	end	of	it	,	he	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	complete	 sentence 	 s 	 	on	his	own	.	``
i	did	n't	know	what	was	going	on	,	but	i	was	so	part	of	the	process	of	 get 	 ting 	 	that	out	.
so	i	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	fine	,	i	've	got	 empath 	 y 	 	,	or	 empath 	 y 	 	,	at	any	rate	,	is	what	's	critical	to	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	interview	.
but	then	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
who	 make 	 s 	 	a	great	interview	in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 text 	 	?
it	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	,	the	quality	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	.
some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	,	you	know	,	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	who	would	never	claim	to	be	 intellectual 	 s 	 	,	but	it	was	never	about	that	.
it	was	about	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	.
it	's	energy	that	 create 	 s 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 interview 	 s 	 	and	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	of	it	.
and	it	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	the	energy	of	 be 	 ing 	 	young	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	people	through	 the 	 ir 	 	90s	.
in	fact	,	the	first	person	i	 interview 	 ed 	 	was	george	abbott	,	who	was	97	,	and	abbott	was	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	the	life	force	--	i	guess	that	's	the	way	i	think	about	it	--	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	it	.
and	so	he	 fill 	 ed 	 	the	room	,	and	we	had	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	conversation	.
he	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	the	 tough 	 est 	 	interview	that	 any 	 body 	 	would	ever	do	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	famous	for	 be 	 ing 	 	silent	,	for	never	ever	 say 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	 may 	 be 	 	a	word	or	two	.
and	,	in	fact	,	he	did	wind	up	 open 	 ing 	 	up	--	by	the	way	,	his	energy	is	 evidence 	 d 	 	in	other	ways	.
he	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	got	married	 aga 	 in 	 	at	102	,	so	he	,	you	know	,	he	had	a	lot	of	the	life	force	in	him	.
but	after	the	interview	,	i	got	a	call	,	 ver 	 y 	 	gruff	voice	,	from	a	woman	.
i	did	n't	know	who	she	was	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	did	you	get	george	abbott	to	talk	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	i	did	.	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	his	old	girlfriend	,	maureen	stapleton	,	and	i	could	never	do	it	.	``
and	then	she	made	me	go	up	with	the	tape	of	it	and	prove	that	george	abbott	 actual 	 ly 	 	could	talk	.
so	,	you	know	,	you	want	energy	,	you	want	the	life	force	,	but	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	them	 al 	 so 	 	to	think	that	they	have	a	story	worth	sharing	.
the	worst	 interview 	 s 	 	that	you	can	ever	have	are	with	people	who	are	modest	.
never	ever	get	up	on	a	stage	with	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	modest	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	these	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 assemble 	 d 	 	to	listen	to	them	,	and	they	 s 	 it 	 	there	and	they	say	,	``	aw	,	shucks	,	it	was	an	accident	.	``
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	ever	 happen 	 s 	 	that	 just 	 ifies 	 	people	taking	good	 hour 	 s 	 	of	the	day	to	be	with	them	.
the	worst	interview	i	ever	did	:	william	l.	shirer	.
the	journalist	who	did	``	the	rise	and	fall	of	the	third	reich	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	guy	had	met	hitler	and	gandhi	 with 	 in 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	every	time	i	'd	ask	him	about	it	,	he	'd	say	,	``	oh	,	i	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	there	.
did	n't	matter	.	``	 what 	 ever 	 	.
awful	.
i	never	would	ever	agree	to	interview	a	modest	person	.
they	have	to	think	that	they	did	 some 	 thing 	 	and	that	they	want	to	share	it	with	you	.
but	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	,	in	the	end	,	to	how	do	you	get	through	all	the	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	we	have	.
all	of	us	are	public	and	private	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	if	all	you	're	going	to	get	from	the	 interview 	 ee 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	public	self	,	there	's	no	point	in	it	.
it	's	pre	-	 programm 	 ed 	 	.	it	's	infomercial	,	and	we	all	have	 infomercial 	 s 	 	about	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
we	know	the	great	lines	,	we	know	the	great	 moment 	 s 	 	,	we	know	what	we	're	not	going	to	share	,	and	the	point	of	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	to	embarrass	 any 	 body 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	--	and	some	of	you	will	remember	 mi 	 ke 	 	wallace	's	old	 interview 	 s 	 	--	tough	,	 aggress 	 ive 	 	and	so	forth	.	they	have	 the 	 ir 	 	place	.
i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	them	to	say	what	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	to	break	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	cocoon	of	the	public	self	,	and	the	more	public	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	,	the	more	 en 	 trench 	 ed 	 	that	person	,	that	 out 	 er 	 	person	was	.
and	let	me	tell	you	at	once	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	moment	and	the	best	moment	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	interview	 s 	 eries 	 	.
it	all	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	that	shell	that	most	of	us	have	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	certain	people	.
there	's	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	woman	named	clare	boothe	luce	.
it	'll	be	your	 generation 	 al 	 	 determi 	 nant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	her	name	 mean 	 s 	 	much	to	you	.
she	did	so	much	.	she	was	a	playwright	.
she	did	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	play	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	women	.	``
she	was	a	 congress 	 woman 	 	when	there	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 congress 	 women 	 	.
she	was	editor	of	 van 	 ity 	 	fair	,	one	of	the	great	 phenomen 	 al 	 	women	of	her	day	.
and	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	i	call	her	the	eleanor	roosevelt	of	the	right	.
she	was	sort	of	 ador 	 ed 	 	on	the	right	the	way	eleanor	roosevelt	was	on	the	left	.
and	,	in	fact	,	when	we	did	the	interview	--	i	did	the	living	self	-	portrait	with	her	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	three	 form 	 er 	 	 director 	 s 	 	of	the	cia	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	her	feet	,	just	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	her	presence	.
and	i	thought	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	piece	of	cake	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 al 	 ways 	 	have	 pre 	 liminary 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	with	these	people	for	just	 may 	 be 	 	10	or	15	 minute 	 s 	 	.
we	never	talk	before	that	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	talk	before	,	you	do	n't	get	it	on	the	stage	.
so	she	and	i	had	a	 de 	 light 	 ful 	 	conversation	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	stage	and	then	--	by	the	way	,	spectacular	.
it	was	all	part	of	clare	boothe	luce	's	look	.
she	was	in	a	great	 even 	 ing 	 	gown	.
she	was	80	,	 al 	 most 	 	that	day	of	the	interview	,	and	there	she	was	and	there	i	was	,	and	i	just	 proceed 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	she	 stone 	 wall 	 ed 	 	me	.	it	was	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
 any 	 thing 	 	that	i	would	ask	,	she	would	turn	around	,	dismiss	,	and	i	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	up	there	--	any	of	you	in	the	moderate	-	to	-	full	 entertain 	 ment 	 	world	know	what	it	is	to	die	 on 	 stage 	 	.
and	i	was	 dy 	 ing 	 	.	she	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	giving	me	a	thing	.
and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	wonder	what	was	going	on	,	and	you	think	while	you	talk	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	thought	,	i	got	it	.
when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	i	was	her	audience	.
now	i	'm	her	competitor	for	the	audience	.
that	's	the	problem	here	,	and	she	's	 fight 	 ing 	 	me	for	that	,	and	so	then	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	a	question	--	i	did	n't	know	how	i	was	going	to	get	out	of	it	--	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	a	question	about	her	 day 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	playwright	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 character 	 istically 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	was	a	playwright	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 bl 	 ah 	 	 bl 	 ah 	 	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	playwright	.	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	i	was	a	playwright	.
most	people	think	that	i	was	an	actress	.	i	was	never	an	actress	.	``
but	i	had	n't	 ask 	 ed 	 	that	,	and	then	she	went	off	on	a	tear	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	well	,	there	was	that	one	time	that	i	was	an	actress	.
it	was	for	a	 char 	 ity 	 	in	connecticut	when	i	was	a	 congress 	 woman 	 	,	and	i	got	up	there	,	``	and	she	went	on	and	on	,	``	and	then	i	got	on	the	stage	.	``
and	then	she	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	you	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	young	 act 	 ors 	 	did	?
they	 up 	 stag 	 ed 	 	me	.	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	know	what	that	is	?	``
just	 with 	 er 	 ing 	 	in	her	 con 	 tempt 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 learn 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	she	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	and	it	was	like	the	 success 	 ful 	 	arm	-	 wrestl 	 e 	 	,	and	then	,	after	that	,	she	 deliver 	 ed 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	account	of	what	her	life	 re 	 ally 	 	was	like	.
i	have	to	end	that	one	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	tribute	to	clare	boothe	luce	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	 remark 	 able 	 	person	.
i	'm	not	 politic 	 ally 	 	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	her	,	but	through	her	life	force	,	i	'm	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	her	.
and	the	way	she	 di 	 ed 	 	--	she	had	,	 to 	 ward 	 	the	end	,	a	brain	tumor	.
that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	a	way	to	die	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	few	of	us	 we 	 re 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	a	 d 	 inner 	 	party	.
and	she	was	in	 horr 	 ible 	 	pain	.
we	all	 k 	 new 	 	that	.
she	 stay 	 ed 	 	in	her	room	.
 every 	 body 	 	came	.	the	 but 	 ler 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	around	 can 	 ape 	 s 	 	.
the	usual	sort	of	thing	.
then	at	a	certain	moment	,	the	door	 open 	 ed 	 	and	she	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 dress 	 ed 	 	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 compose 	 d 	 	.

she	 want 	 ed 	 	the	control	of	her	final	moment	,	and	she	did	it	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	.
now	,	there	are	other	ways	that	you	get	 some 	 body 	 	to	open	up	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	brief	 re 	 ference 	 	.
it	was	n't	 th 	 is 	 	arm	-	 wrestl 	 e 	 	,	but	it	was	a	little	surprising	for	the	person	 involve 	 d 	 	.

and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	,	and	 al 	 most 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	interview	,	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	him	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	steve	,	``	or	``	mr.	martin	,	it	is	 s 	 aid 	 	that	all	 comedian 	 s 	 	have	 un 	 happy 	 	 child 	 hood 	 s 	 	.

and	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	to	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	're	going	to	start	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	right	off	?	``
and	then	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	not	 stupid 	 ly 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	was	your	 child 	 hood 	 	like	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	--	these	are	all	arm	 wrestl 	 es 	 	,	but	they	're	 affect 	 ion 	 ate 	 	--	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	father	was	loving	and	 support 	 ive 	 	,	which	is	why	i	'm	not	funny	.	``
and	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	and	then	we	heard	the	big	 s 	 ad 	 	story	.
his	father	was	an	sob	,	and	,	in	fact	,	he	was	 an 	 other 	 	comedian	with	an	 un 	 happy 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	,	but	then	we	 we 	 re 	 	off	and	running	.
so	the	question	is	:	what	is	the	key	that	's	going	to	allow	 th 	 is 	 	to	proceed	?
now	,	these	are	arm	 wrestl 	 e 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	but	i	want	to	tell	you	about	 question 	 s 	 	that	are	more	related	to	 empath 	 y 	 	and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	are	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	whole	 live 	 s 	 	to	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	'll	just	give	you	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	time	 constraint 	 s 	 	.
one	was	an	interview	i	did	with	one	of	the	great	american	 bi 	 ographer 	 s 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	some	of	you	will	know	him	,	most	of	you	wo	n't	,	dumas	malone	.
he	did	a	five	-	volume	 bio 	 graphy 	 	of	thomas	jefferson	,	 s 	 pent 	 	 virtual 	 ly 	 	his	whole	life	with	thomas	jefferson	,	and	by	the	way	,	at	one	point	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	``	would	you	like	to	have	met	him	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	of	course	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	know	him	better	than	 any 	 one 	 	who	ever	met	him	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	got	to	read	all	of	his	 letter 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	satisfied	with	the	kind	of	relationship	they	had	over	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	one	question	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	did	jefferson	ever	disappoint	you	?	``
and	here	is	 th 	 is 	 	man	who	had	 give 	 n 	 	his	whole	life	to	 un 	 cover 	 ing 	 	jefferson	and	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	him	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	.	.	.	``	--	i	'm	going	to	do	a	bad	southern	accent	.
dumas	malone	was	from	mississippi	 original 	 ly 	 	.
but	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	so	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	've	read	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	mr.	jefferson	would	smooth	the	truth	a	bit	.	``
and	he	 bas 	 ically 	 	was	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	man	who	 li 	 ed 	 	more	than	he	 wish 	 ed 	 	he	had	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	saw	the	 letter 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	i	understand	that	.	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	understand	that	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	 southern 	 ers 	 	do	like	a	smooth	surface	,	so	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 time 	 s 	 	when	he	just	did	n't	want	the	 confront 	 ation 	 	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	now	,	john	adams	was	too	honest	.	``
and	he	 start 	 ed 	 	to	talk	about	that	,	and	 lat 	 er 	 	on	he	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	to	his	house	,	and	i	met	his	wife	who	was	from	massachusetts	,	and	he	and	she	had	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	relationship	of	thomas	jefferson	and	john	adams	.
she	was	the	new	englander	and	 abras 	 ive 	 	,	and	he	was	 th 	 is 	 	 court 	 ly 	 	fellow	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	question	i	ever	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	and	most	of	the	 time 	 s 	 	when	i	talk	about	it	,	people	kind	of	suck	in	 the 	 ir 	 	breath	at	my	 au 	 da 	 city 	 	,	or	 cruel 	 ty 	 	,	but	i	promise	you	it	was	the	right	question	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	to	agnes	de	mille	.
agnes	de	mille	is	one	of	the	great	 choreograph 	 ers 	 	in	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
she	 bas 	 ically 	 	 create 	 d 	 	the	 dance 	 s 	 	in	``	oklahoma	,	``	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	american	theater	.
an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	woman	.
at	the	time	that	i	 pro 	 posed 	 	to	her	that	--	by	the	way	,	i	would	have	 pro 	 posed 	 	to	her	;	she	was	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	--	but	 pro 	 posed 	 	to	her	that	she	come	on	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	come	to	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.	``
she	lived	in	new	york	.
``	come	to	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	and	we	'll	talk	for	 t 	 hose 	 	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	'll	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	we	proceed	.	``
and	so	i	 show 	 ed 	 	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	dark	,	 ram 	 bling 	 	new	york	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	,	and	she	 call 	 ed 	 	out	to	me	,	and	she	was	in	bed	.
i	had	known	that	she	had	had	a	stroke	,	and	that	was	some	10	 year 	 s 	 	before	.
and	so	she	 s 	 pent 	 	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	her	life	in	bed	,	but	--	i	speak	of	the	life	force	--	her	hair	was	 a 	 s 	 kew 	 	.
she	was	n't	about	to	make	up	for	 th 	 is 	 	occasion	.
and	she	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	her	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	 possess 	 ion 	 	she	felt	at	that	moment	was	her	will	,	which	she	had	by	her	side	.
she	was	n't	 un 	 happy 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	she	was	 re 	 sign 	 ed 	 	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	keep	 th 	 is 	 	will	by	my	bed	,	 me 	 ment 	 o 	 	mori	,	and	i	change	it	all	the	time	just	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	.	``
and	she	was	loving	the	prospect	of	death	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	she	had	 love 	 d 	 	life	.
i	thought	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 body 	 	i	've	got	to	get	in	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	.
she	 agree 	 d 	 	.
she	came	on	.	of	course	she	was	 wheelchair 	 ed 	 	on	.
half	of	her	body	was	stricken	,	the	other	half	not	.
she	was	,	of	course	,	 d 	 one 	 	up	for	the	occasion	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	woman	in	great	physical	 di 	 stress 	 	.
and	we	had	a	conversation	,	and	then	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 think 	 able 	 	question	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	was	it	a	problem	for	you	in	your	life	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	not	 beaut 	 iful 	 	?	``
and	the	audience	just	--	you	know	,	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	on	the	side	of	the	 interview 	 ee 	 	,	and	they	felt	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	kind	of	assault	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	question	she	had	 want 	 ed 	 	 some 	 body 	 	to	ask	her	whole	life	.
and	she	 beg 	 an 	 	to	talk	about	her	 child 	 hood 	 	,	when	she	was	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	and	she	 liter 	 ally 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	--	here	she	was	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	broken	body	--	and	she	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	the	audience	and	 de 	 scribed 	 	 her 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	fair	 demo 	 is 	 elle 	 	with	her	red	hair	and	her	light	 step 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	,	and	then	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	then	puberty	hit	.	``
and	she	 beg 	 an 	 	to	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	that	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	her	body	and	her	face	,	and	how	she	could	no	 long 	 er 	 	count	on	her	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	and	her	family	then	 treat 	 ed 	 	her	like	the	 ug 	 ly 	 	sister	of	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	one	for	whom	all	the	ballet	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	.
and	she	had	to	go	 a 	 long 	 	just	to	be	with	her	sister	for	company	,	and	in	that	process	,	she	made	a	number	of	 decision 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	was	that	dance	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	had	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	her	,	was	her	life	.
and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	she	had	better	be	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	she	did	dance	for	a	while	,	a	 choreograph 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	then	her	 look 	 s 	 	did	n't	matter	.
but	she	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	to	get	that	out	 a 	 s 	 	a	real	,	real	fact	in	her	life	.
it	was	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	privilege	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	other	 moment 	 s 	 	like	that	,	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 moment 	 s 	 	of	silence	.
the	key	point	was	 empath 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	people	to	ask	them	 question 	 s 	 	,	so	that	they	can	be	 truth 	 ful 	 	about	who	they	are	and	how	they	 be 	 came 	 	what	they	are	,	and	i	 commen 	 d 	 	that	to	you	,	even	if	you	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 interview 	 s 	 	.
just	be	that	way	with	your	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	 old 	 er 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	your	family	.
