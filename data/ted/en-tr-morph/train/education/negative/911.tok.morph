 tree 	 s 	 	epitomize	 s 	 ta 	 sis 	 	.
 tree 	 s 	 	are	 root 	 ed 	 	in	the	ground	in	one	place	for	 man 	 y 	 	human	 generation 	 s 	 	,	but	if	we	shift	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	from	the	trunk	to	the	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	,	 tree 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	dynamic	 ent 	 ities 	 	,	moving	and	growing	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	by	 turn 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	.
i	 simpl 	 y 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	the	end	of	a	 paint 	 brush 	 	onto	a	 t 	 wig 	 	.
i	 wait 	 ed 	 	for	the	wind	to	come	up	and	held	up	a	canvas	,	and	that	 produce 	 d 	 	art	.
the	piece	of	art	you	see	on	your	left	is	 paint 	 ed 	 	by	a	western	red	cedar	and	that	on	your	right	by	a	douglas	fir	,	and	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	different	species	have	different	 signature 	 s 	 	,	like	a	picasso	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	a	monet	.
but	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	and	how	 th 	 is 	 	art	might	let	me	capture	that	and	 quant 	 ify 	 	it	,	so	to	measure	the	distance	that	a	single	vine	 ma 	 ple 	 	tree	--	which	 produce 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	--	 move 	 d 	 	in	a	single	year	,	i	 simpl 	 y 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	and	 summ 	 ed 	 	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	lines	.
i	 multi 	 plied 	 	them	by	the	number	of	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	per	branch	and	the	number	of	 branch 	 es 	 	per	tree	and	then	 divid 	 ed 	 	that	by	the	number	of	 minute 	 s 	 	per	year	.
and	so	i	was	able	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	how	far	a	single	tree	 move 	 d 	 	in	a	single	year	.
you	might	have	a	guess	.
the	answer	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	186,540	 mile 	 s 	 	,	or	seven	 time 	 s 	 	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
and	so	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	shifting	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	from	a	single	trunk	to	the	 man 	 y 	 	dynamic	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	,	we	are	able	to	see	that	 tree 	 s 	 	are	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	static	 ent 	 ities 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	dynamic	.
and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	ways	that	we	might	consider	 th 	 is 	 	 less 	 on 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	,	to	consider	other	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	are	 al 	 so 	 	static	and	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	but	which	cry	for	change	and	 dynamic 	 ism 	 	,	and	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ent 	 ities 	 	is	our	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	are	where	people	who	break	our	 law 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 bar 	 s 	 	.
and	our	 pri 	 son 	 	system	 it 	 self 	 	is	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	over	2.3	million	 incarce 	 rated 	 	men	and	women	.
that	number	is	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
of	the	100	 incarce 	 rated 	 	people	that	are	released	,	60	will	return	to	 pri 	 son 	 	.
 fund 	 s 	 	for	education	,	for	training	and	for	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	are	 dec 	 lining 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	 despair 	 ing 	 	cycle	of	 incarce 	 ration 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	ask	 whet 	 her 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 	i	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 tree 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	could	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	a	static	institution	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	.
in	the	year	2007	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	the	washington	state	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	 correct 	 ions 	 	.
 work 	 ing 	 	with	four	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	science	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 sustain 	 ability 	 	and	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 project 	 s 	 	to	four	state	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
we	give	science	 lectur 	 es 	 	,	and	the	men	here	are	 choos 	 ing 	 	to	come	to	our	science	 lectur 	 es 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	or	 weight 	 lift 	 ing 	 	.
that	,	i	think	,	is	 move 	 ment 	 	.
we	 partner 	 ed 	 	with	the	nature	 conserv 	 ancy 	 	for	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	at	stafford	creek	 correct 	 ional 	 	center	to	grow	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	prairie	 plant 	 s 	 	for	 resto 	 ration 	 	of	 re 	 lic 	 	prairie	 area 	 s 	 	in	washington	state	.
that	,	i	think	,	is	 move 	 ment 	 	.
we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	the	washington	state	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	fish	and	 wild 	 life 	 	to	grow	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 frog 	 s 	 	--	the	oregon	 spot 	 ted 	 	frog	--	for	 lat 	 er 	 	 re 	 lease 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	.
that	,	i	think	,	is	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	 beg 	 un 	 	to	work	with	 t 	 hose 	 	men	who	are	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	in	what	we	call	supermax	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
they	've	 incur 	 red 	 	violent	 in 	 fraction 	 s 	 	by	 be 	 coming 	 	violent	with	 guard 	 s 	 	and	with	other	 prisoner 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 ke 	 pt 	 	in	bare	 cell 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	for	23	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
when	they	have	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	review	 board 	 s 	 	or	mental	health	 professional 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 place 	 d 	 	in	 im 	 mobile 	 	 booth 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
for	one	hour	a	day	they	're	 br 	 ought 	 	to	these	 b 	 leak 	 	and	 b 	 land 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	 yard 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	ca	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	and	prairie	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 frog 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 environment 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	nature	 in 	 to 	 	these	 exercis 	 e 	 	 yard 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	them	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	,	so	at	 l 	 east 	 	they	get	contact	with	visual	 image 	 s 	 	of	nature	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	mr.	lopez	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	 con 	 fine 	 ment 	 	for	18	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 in 	 put 	 	on	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	that	he	 believ 	 es 	 	would	make	him	and	his	fellow	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	more	 s 	 er 	 ene 	 	,	more	calm	,	less	apt	to	violence	.
and	so	what	we	see	,	i	think	,	is	that	small	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	of	change	can	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	move	an	 ent 	 ity 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	own	 pri 	 son 	 	system	in	a	direction	of	hope	.
we	know	that	 tree 	 s 	 	are	static	 ent 	 ities 	 	when	we	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 trunk 	 s 	 	.
but	if	 tree 	 s 	 	can	create	art	,	if	they	can	 en 	 circle 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	seven	 time 	 s 	 	in	one	year	,	if	 prisoner 	 s 	 	can	grow	 plant 	 s 	 	and	raise	 frog 	 s 	 	,	then	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	are	other	static	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	we	hold	 in 	 side 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	like	grief	,	like	 addict 	 ions 	 	,	like	 rac 	 ism 	 	,	that	can	 al 	 so 	 	change	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
