well	,	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	to	talk	about	,	but	i	think	i	'm	just	going	to	play	to	start	off	.
♫	when	i	wake	up	♫	♫	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	♫	♫	i	pour	the	coffee	♫	♫	i	read	the	paper	♫	♫	and	then	i	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	♫	♫	and	so	 soft 	 ly 	 	♫	♫	do	the	 dish 	 es 	 	♫	♫	so	feed	the	 fish 	 es 	 	♫	♫	you	 s 	 ing 	 	me	happy	 birth 	 day 	 	♫	♫	like	it	's	gon	na	be	♫	♫	your	last	day	♫	♫	here	on	earth	♫	all	right	.
so	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	special	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	want	to	debut	a	new	song	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	in	the	last	five	or	six	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	few	 thing 	 s 	 	more	 thrill 	 ing 	 	than	 play 	 ing 	 	a	song	for	the	first	time	in	front	of	an	audience	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	it	's	half	-	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
i	'm	kind	of	 hop 	 ing 	 	some	 conversation 	 s 	 	here	might	help	me	finish	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	crazy	 realm 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	song	about	 loop 	 s 	 	,	but	not	the	kind	of	 loop 	 s 	 	that	i	make	up	here	.
they	're	 feed 	 back 	 	 loop 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	audio	world	that	's	when	the	 micro 	 phone 	 	 get 	 s 	 	too	close	to	 it 	 s 	 	sound	source	,	and	then	it	 get 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	self	-	 destruct 	 ive 	 	loop	that	 create 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	sound	.
and	i	'm	going	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	for	you	.
i	'm	not	going	to	hurt	you	.	do	n't	worry	.
♫	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	loop	,	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	♫	♫	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	loop	,	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	♫	♫	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	loop	,	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	♫	♫	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	loop	,	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	♫	♫	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	loop	,	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	♫	♫	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	loop	,	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	♫	♫	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	--	all	right	.	i	do	n't	know	if	that	was	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	--	--	but	my	point	is	it	's	the	sound	of	self	-	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	that	 appli 	 es 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	a	whole	spectrum	of	 realm 	 s 	 	,	from	,	say	,	the	 eco 	 logical 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
there	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	a	rule	in	nature	that	if	you	get	too	close	to	where	you	came	from	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	.
so	like	,	you	ca	n't	feed	 cow 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 brain 	 s 	 	or	you	get	mad	cow	disease	,	and	 in 	 breed 	 ing 	 	and	 inc 	 est 	 	and	,	let	's	see	,	what	's	the	other	one	?
 bio 	 logical 	 	--	there	's	 auto 	 immun 	 e 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	where	the	body	 attack 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	a	little	too	 over 	 zeal 	 ously 	 	and	 destroy 	 s 	 	the	host	,	or	the	person	.
and	then	--	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	get	to	the	song	--	kind	of	 bridge 	 s 	 	the	gap	to	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	've	used	scientific	 term 	 s 	 	in	 song 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	to	make	them	 lyric 	 al 	 	.
and	there	's	some	 thing 	 s 	 	you	just	do	n't	need	to	have	in	 song 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	bridge	 th 	 is 	 	gap	between	 th 	 is 	 	idea	and	 th 	 is 	 	 melo 	 dy 	 	.
and	so	,	i	do	n't	know	if	you	've	ever	had	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	when	i	close	my	 eye 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	and	try	to	sleep	,	i	ca	n't	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	about	my	own	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	like	your	 eye 	 s 	 	start	 s 	 training 	 	to	see	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
that	's	what	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	to	me	.
it	's	not	 pleas 	 ant 	 	.
i	'm	sorry	if	i	put	that	idea	in	your	head	.
it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	,	of	course	,	for	your	 eye 	 s 	 	to	see	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	but	they	seem	to	be	 try 	 ing 	 	.
so	that	's	 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	more	 close 	 r 	 	to	a	personal	experience	.
or	 ear 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	hear	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	it	's	just	 im 	 possible 	 	.
that	's	the	thing	.
so	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	song	that	 ment 	 ions 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	and	then	 al 	 so 	 	 imagine 	 s 	 	a	person	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	so	 success 	 ful 	 	at	 defend 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 heart 	 break 	 	that	they	're	left	to	do	the	 de 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	if	that	's	possible	.
and	that	's	what	the	song	is	 ask 	 ing 	 	.
all	right	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	name	yet	.
♫	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	 congratula 	 te 	 	 your 	 self 	 	♫	♫	give	 your 	 self 	 	a	hand	,	the	hand	is	your	hand	♫	♫	and	the	eye	that	 eye 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	is	your	eye	♫	♫	and	the	ear	that	 hear 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	is	near	♫	♫	'	cause	it	's	your	ear	,	oh	oh	♫	♫	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	the	 im 	 possible 	 	now	♫	♫	took	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 part 	 	♫	♫	you	made	 your 	 self 	 	 in 	 vulner 	 able 	 	♫	♫	no	one	can	break	your	heart	♫	♫	so	you	wear	it	out	♫	♫	and	you	 wr 	 ing 	 	it	out	♫	♫	and	you	wear	it	out	♫	♫	and	you	break	it	 your 	 self 	 	♫	♫	 break 	 ing 	 	your	own	,	break	it	 your 	 self 	 	♫	♫	 break 	 ing 	 	your	own	,	break	it	 your 	 self 	 	♫	♫	 break 	 ing 	 	your	own	♫	 thank 	 s 	 	.
all	right	.
it	's	kind	of	cool	.	songwriters	can	sort	of	get	away	with	murder	.
you	can	throw	out	crazy	 the 	 ories 	 	and	not	have	to	back	it	up	with	data	or	 graph 	 s 	 	or	research	.
but	,	you	know	,	i	think	reckless	curiosity	would	be	what	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	,	just	a	little	bit	.
i	'm	going	to	finish	up	with	a	song	of	mine	 call 	 ed 	 	``	weather	 system 	 s 	 	.	``
