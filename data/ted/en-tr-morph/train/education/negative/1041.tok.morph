so	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	some	people	who	did	n't	move	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
the	first	one	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	right	here	in	chicago	.
brenda	 palm 	 s 	 	-	farber	was	 hire 	 d 	 	to	help	ex	-	convicts	 re 	 enter 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	keep	them	from	going	back	 in 	 to 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	.
 current 	 ly 	 	,	 taxpayer 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	about	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	year	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	person	to	jail	.
we	know	that	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	them	are	going	to	go	back	.
i	find	it	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	,	for	every	one	dollar	we	 s 	 pend 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	on	early	 child 	 hood 	 	education	,	like	head	start	,	we	 s 	 ave 	 	17	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	stuff	like	 incarce 	 ration 	 	in	the	future	.
or	--	think	about	it	--	that	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	is	more	than	what	it	 cost 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	one	person	to	harvard	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	brenda	,	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 phase 	 d 	 	by	stuff	like	that	,	took	a	look	at	her	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	came	up	with	a	not	-	so	-	obvious	solution	:	create	a	business	that	 produce 	 s 	 	skin	care	 product 	 s 	 	from	honey	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	it	might	be	obvious	to	some	of	you	;	it	was	n't	to	me	.
it	's	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	growing	a	form	of	social	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	real	potential	.
she	 hire 	 d 	 	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 un 	 employ 	 able 	 	men	and	women	to	care	for	the	bees	,	harvest	the	honey	and	make	value	-	 add 	 ed 	 	 product 	 s 	 	that	they	 market 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	that	 we 	 re 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 s 	 old 	 	at	whole	 food 	 s 	 	.
she	 combine 	 d 	 	 employ 	 ment 	 	experience	and	training	with	life	 skill 	 s 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	,	like	anger	-	management	and	 team 	 work 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	how	to	talk	to	future	 employ 	 ers 	 	about	how	 the 	 ir 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 demonst 	 rated 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	that	they	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 eager 	 ness 	 	to	learn	more	.
less	than	four	percent	of	the	 folk 	 s 	 	that	went	through	her	program	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	back	to	jail	.
so	these	young	men	and	women	 learn 	 ed 	 	job	-	 read 	 iness 	 	and	life	 skill 	 s 	 	through	bee	 keep 	 ing 	 	and	 be 	 came 	 	productive	 citizen 	 s 	 	in	the	process	.
talk	about	a	sweet	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	going	to	take	you	to	los	angeles	,	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	know	that	l.a.	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	l.a.	's	water	 issue 	 s 	 	right	now	.
they	have	not	 en 	 ough 	 	water	on	most	 day 	 s 	 	and	too	much	to	handle	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	.
 current 	 ly 	 	,	20	percent	of	california	's	energy	consumption	is	used	to	pump	water	 in 	 to 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	southern	california	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 load 	 s 	 	,	 load 	 s 	 	,	to	channel	that	 rain 	 water 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	and	 flood 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
now	andy	lipkis	is	 work 	 ing 	 	to	help	l.a.	cut	 infra 	 structure 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	water	management	and	urban	heat	 is 	 land 	 	--	 link 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	people	and	technology	to	create	a	more	 liv 	 able 	 	city	.
all	that	green	stuff	 actual 	 ly 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	 absorb 	 s 	 	storm	water	,	 al 	 so 	 	 help 	 s 	 	cool	our	cities	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	come	to	think	about	it	,	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	air	-	 condition 	 ing 	 	,	or	is	it	a	 cool 	 er 	 	room	that	you	want	?
how	you	get	it	should	n't	make	that	much	of	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
so	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	l.a.	 count 	 y 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	that	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	2.5	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	repair	the	city	 school 	 s 	 	.
and	andy	and	his	team	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	200	million	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	asphalt	to	surround	the	 school 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	by	 present 	 ing 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	strong	economic	case	,	they	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	the	l.a.	government	that	 re 	 placing 	 	that	asphalt	with	 tree 	 s 	 	and	other	 green 	 ery 	 	,	that	the	 school 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	would	 s 	 ave 	 	the	system	more	on	energy	than	they	 s 	 pend 	 	on	 horti 	 cultural 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
so	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	20	million	square	feet	of	asphalt	was	 replace 	 d 	 	or	 avoid 	 ed 	 	,	and	 electric 	 al 	 	consumption	for	air	-	 condition 	 ing 	 	went	down	,	while	 employ 	 ment 	 	for	people	to	maintain	 t 	 hose 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	went	up	,	 result 	 ing 	 	in	a	net	-	 saving 	 s 	 	to	the	system	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 health 	 ier 	 	 student 	 s 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	system	 employ 	 ees 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
now	judy	 bond 	 s 	 	is	a	coal	 min 	 er 	 	's	daughter	.
her	family	 ha 	 s 	 	eight	 generation 	 s 	 	in	a	town	 call 	 ed 	 	whitesville	,	west	virginia	.
and	if	 any 	 one 	 	should	be	 cl 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	the	 form 	 er 	 	 glor 	 y 	 	of	the	coal	 min 	 ing 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	of	the	town	,	it	should	be	judy	.
but	the	way	coal	is	 min 	 ed 	 	right	now	is	different	from	the	deep	 mine 	 s 	 	that	her	father	and	her	father	's	father	would	go	down	 in 	 to 	 	and	that	 employ 	 ed 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.
now	,	two	dozen	men	can	tear	down	a	mountain	in	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	for	about	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	coal	.
that	kind	of	technology	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	.	``
it	can	make	a	mountain	go	from	 th 	 is 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	few	short	 month 	 s 	 	.
just	imagine	that	the	air	 surround 	 ing 	 	these	 place 	 s 	 	--	it	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	the	residue	of	 explosive 	 s 	 	and	coal	.
when	we	 visit 	 ed 	 	,	it	 g 	 ave 	 	some	of	the	people	we	 we 	 re 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	strange	little	cough	after	 be 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	there	for	just	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	or	so	--	not	just	 min 	 ers 	 	,	but	 every 	 body 	 	.
and	judy	saw	her	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	and	her	water	 poison 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	coal	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	just	move	on	after	the	mountain	was	 empti 	 ed 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	even	more	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	wake	.
but	she	 al 	 so 	 	saw	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	potential	wind	energy	on	an	 in 	 tact 	 	mountain	,	and	one	that	was	 reduc 	 ed 	 	in	 elev 	 ation 	 	by	over	2,000	feet	.
three	 year 	 s 	 	of	 dirt 	 y 	 	energy	with	not	 man 	 y 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	or	centuries	of	clean	energy	with	the	potential	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	and	 improve 	 ments 	 	in	efficiency	based	on	technical	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	local	knowledge	about	how	to	get	the	most	out	of	that	region	's	wind	.
she	 calcul 	 ated 	 	the	up	-	front	cost	and	the	 pay 	 back 	 	over	time	,	and	it	's	a	net	-	plus	on	so	 man 	 y 	 	 level 	 s 	 	for	the	local	,	national	and	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
it	's	a	 long 	 er 	 	 pay 	 back 	 	than	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	,	but	the	wind	energy	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pay 	 s 	 	back	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
now	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	 pay 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	money	to	the	 local 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 give 	 s 	 	them	a	lot	of	 mis 	 ery 	 	.
the	water	is	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 go 	 o 	 	.
most	people	are	still	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	most	of	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	social	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	people	in	inner	cities	 al 	 so 	 	experience	--	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	domestic	abuse	,	teen	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	and	poor	heath	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
now	judy	and	i	--	i	have	to	say	--	 total 	 ly 	 	related	to	each	other	.
not	 quit 	 e 	 	an	obvious	alliance	.
i	mean	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	her	 home 	 town 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	whitesville	,	west	virginia	.
i	mean	,	they	are	not	--	they	ai	n't	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	for	the	 birth 	 place 	 	of	hip	hop	title	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
but	the	back	of	my	t	-	shirt	,	the	one	that	she	 g 	 ave 	 	me	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 hill 	 bill 	 ies 	 	.	``
so	 home 	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 hill 	 bill 	 ies 	 	we	got	it	together	and	 total 	 ly 	 	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	's	all	about	.
but	just	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	judy	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	stage	-	three	lung	cancer	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	since	 move 	 d 	 	to	her	 bone 	 s 	 	and	her	brain	.
and	i	just	find	it	so	bizarre	that	she	's	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	the	same	thing	that	she	 tri 	 ed 	 	so	hard	to	protect	people	from	.
but	her	dream	of	coal	river	mountain	wind	is	her	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
and	she	might	not	get	to	see	that	 mountain 	 top 	 	.
but	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	writing	yet	some	kind	of	 manifest 	 o 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	she	's	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	business	plan	to	make	it	happen	.
that	's	what	my	 home 	 girl 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	'm	so	proud	of	that	.
but	these	three	people	do	n't	know	each	other	,	but	they	do	have	an	awful	lot	in	common	.
they	're	all	problem	 solve 	 rs 	 	,	and	they	're	just	some	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	am	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	see	,	meet	and	learn	from	in	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	work	that	i	do	now	.
i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	have	them	all	 feature 	 d 	 	on	my	corporation	for	public	radio	radio	show	 call 	 ed 	 	thepromisedland.org	.
now	they	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	 vision 	 aries 	 	.
they	take	a	look	at	the	 demand 	 s 	 	that	are	out	there	--	 beaut 	 y 	 	 product 	 s 	 	,	 health 	 y 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	 electric 	 ity 	 	--	and	how	the	money	's	 flow 	 ing 	 	to	meet	 t 	 hose 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	.
and	when	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	involve	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	number	of	 job 	 s 	 	,	you	're	left	with	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	people	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	n't	cheap	.
in	fact	,	they	make	up	some	of	what	i	call	the	most	expensive	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	and	they	include	 generation 	 ally 	 	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	,	 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 	 vet 	 s 	 	 return 	 ing 	 	from	the	middle	east	,	people	coming	out	of	jail	.
and	for	the	 veteran 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	v.a	.	 s 	 aid 	 	there	's	a	six	-	fold	 in 	 crease 	 	in	mental	health	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	by	 vet 	 s 	 	since	2003	.
i	think	that	number	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	go	up	.
they	're	not	the	largest	number	of	people	,	but	they	are	some	of	the	most	expensive	--	and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	for	domestic	abuse	,	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	poor	performance	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	poor	health	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	stress	.
so	these	three	 guy 	 s 	 	all	understand	how	to	 productive 	 ly 	 	channel	 dollar 	 s 	 	through	our	local	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	to	meet	 exist 	 ing 	 	market	 demand 	 s 	 	,	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	social	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	now	and	prevent	new	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
and	there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	like	that	.
one	problem	:	waste	 hand 	 ling 	 	and	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
even	when	we	think	or	talk	about	 recycl 	 ing 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 recycl 	 able 	 	stuff	 end 	 s 	 	up	 get 	 ting 	 	 inciner 	 ated 	 	or	in	 land 	 fill 	 s 	 	and	 leav 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 municipal 	 ities 	 	,	 divers 	 ion 	 	rates	--	they	 leav 	 e 	 	much	to	be	 recycl 	 ed 	 	.
and	where	is	 th 	 is 	 	waste	 handle 	 d 	 	?	 usual 	 ly 	 	in	poor	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
and	we	know	that	eco	-	industrial	business	,	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	business	 model 	 s 	 	--	there	's	a	model	in	europe	 call 	 ed 	 	the	eco	-	industrial	park	,	where	either	the	waste	of	one	company	is	the	raw	material	for	 an 	 other 	 	,	or	you	use	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	make	 good 	 s 	 	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	and	sell	.
we	can	create	these	local	 market 	 s 	 	and	 incentive 	 s 	 	for	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	raw	 material 	 s 	 	for	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
and	in	my	 home 	 town 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	one	of	these	in	the	bronx	,	but	our	mayor	 decide 	 d 	 	what	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	was	a	jail	on	that	same	spot	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	--	but	after	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	city	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	a	jail	.
they	've	since	 abandon 	 ed 	 	that	project	,	thank	 good 	 ness 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	problem	:	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	food	 system 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
 work 	 ing 	 	-	class	and	poor	urban	americans	are	not	 benefit 	 ing 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	from	our	current	food	system	.
it	 re 	 lies 	 	too	much	on	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	chemical	 fertil 	 ization 	 	,	big	use	of	water	and	 al 	 so 	 	 refrige 	 ration 	 	.
mega	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	often	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 poison 	 ing 	 	our	 water 	 ways 	 	and	our	land	,	and	it	 produce 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	product	that	 cost 	 s 	 	us	 billion 	 s 	 	in	 health 	 care 	 	and	lost	 product 	 ivity 	 	.
and	so	we	know	``	urban	ag	``	is	a	big	buzz	 top 	 ic 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	of	the	year	,	but	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 garden 	 ing 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	some	value	in	community	building	--	 lot 	 s 	 	of	it	--	but	it	's	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	creating	 job 	 s 	 	or	for	food	production	.
the	 number 	 s 	 	just	are	n't	there	.
part	of	my	work	now	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 lay 	 ing 	 	the	 ground 	 work 	 	to	integrate	urban	ag	and	 r 	 ural 	 	food	 system 	 s 	 	to	 ha 	 sten 	 	the	 de 	 mise 	 	of	the	3,000	-	mile	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	by	creating	a	national	brand	of	urban	-	grown	produce	in	every	city	,	that	uses	 region 	 al 	 	growing	power	and	 augment 	 s 	 	it	with	 in 	 door 	 	growing	 facil 	 ities 	 	,	owned	and	 oper 	 ated 	 	by	small	 grow 	 ers 	 	,	where	now	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	support	 season 	 al 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	around	metro	 area 	 s 	 	who	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	out	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	meet	the	year	-	round	demand	for	produce	.
it	's	not	a	 com 	 petition 	 	with	 r 	 ural 	 	farm	;	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reinforce 	 ments 	 	.
it	 al 	 lies 	 	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	positive	and	 economic 	 ally 	 	 vi 	 able 	 	food	system	.
the	goal	is	to	meet	the	cities	'	 institution 	 al 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	senior	 center 	 s 	 	,	 school 	 s 	 	,	 day 	 care 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	produce	a	network	of	 region 	 al 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
and	how	we	manage	our	built	environment	 affect 	 s 	 	the	health	and	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	people	every	single	day	.
our	 municipal 	 ities 	 	,	 r 	 ural 	 	and	urban	,	play	the	 operation 	 al 	 	course	of	 infra 	 structure 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	waste	 dispos 	 al 	 	,	energy	demand	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	social	 cost 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	,	drop	-	out	rates	,	 incarce 	 ration 	 	rates	and	the	 impact 	 s 	 	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	public	health	 cost 	 s 	 	.
smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	can	provide	cost	-	saving	ways	for	 municipal 	 ities 	 	to	handle	both	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	social	 need 	 s 	 	.
and	we	want	to	shift	the	 system 	 s 	 	that	open	the	 door 	 s 	 	for	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	tax	 burden 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	tax	base	.
and	imagine	a	national	business	model	that	 create 	 s 	 	local	 job 	 s 	 	and	smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	to	improve	local	economic	 st 	 ability 	 	.
so	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	you	can	see	a	little	theme	here	.
these	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ate 	 	a	trend	.
i	have	n't	 create 	 d 	 	it	,	and	it	's	not	 happen 	 ing 	 	by	accident	.
i	'm	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	country	,	and	the	good	news	is	that	it	's	growing	.
and	we	all	need	to	be	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	it	.
it	is	an	essential	pillar	to	 th 	 is 	 	country	's	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
and	i	call	it	``	 home 	 town 	 	security	.	``
the	 recess 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	us	 reel 	 ing 	 	and	 fear 	 ful 	 	,	and	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	air	these	 day 	 s 	 	that	is	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 empower 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	a	 real 	 ization 	 	that	we	are	the	key	to	our	own	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
now	is	the	time	for	us	to	act	in	our	own	 commun 	 ities 	 	where	we	think	local	and	we	act	local	.
and	when	we	do	that	,	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	--	be	they	next	-	door	,	or	in	the	next	state	,	or	in	the	next	country	--	will	be	just	fine	.
the	sum	of	the	local	is	the	global	.
 home 	 town 	 	security	 mean 	 s 	 	 re 	 building 	 	our	natural	 defense 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	people	to	work	,	 re 	 storing 	 	our	natural	 system 	 s 	 	.
 home 	 town 	 	security	 mean 	 s 	 	creating	wealth	here	at	home	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 destroy 	 ing 	 	it	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	.

the	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	us	now	is	to	identify	and	support	 count 	 less 	 	more	.
now	,	 home 	 town 	 	security	is	about	taking	care	of	your	own	,	but	it	's	not	like	the	old	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 char 	 ity 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	at	home	.	``
i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	read	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	love	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	``	by	john	hope	bryant	.
and	it	's	about	 lead 	 ing 	 	in	a	world	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	seem	to	be	 oper 	 ating 	 	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	fear	.
and	 read 	 ing 	 	that	book	made	me	 re 	 examine 	 	that	 theor 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	need	to	explain	what	i	mean	by	that	.
see	,	my	dad	was	a	great	,	great	man	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
he	grew	up	in	the	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	south	,	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	 ly 	 nch 	 ing 	 	and	all	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	some	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 provide 	 d 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 table 	 	home	for	me	and	my	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	and	a	whole	bunch	of	other	people	that	fell	on	hard	 time 	 s 	 	.
but	,	like	all	of	us	,	he	had	some	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	his	was	 gam 	 bling 	 	,	 compulsive 	 ly 	 	.
to	him	that	phrase	,	``	 char 	 ity 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	at	home	,	``	 me 	 ant 	 	that	my	 pay 	 day 	 	--	or	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	--	would	just	happen	to	coincide	with	his	 luck 	 y 	 	day	.
so	you	need	to	help	him	out	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	would	loan	him	money	from	my	after	-	school	or	summer	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 al 	 ways 	 	had	the	great	 intent 	 ion 	 	of	 pay 	 ing 	 	me	back	with	interest	,	of	course	,	after	he	hit	it	big	.
and	he	did	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	at	a	 race 	 track 	 	in	los	angeles	--	one	reason	to	love	l.a.	--	back	in	the	1940s	.
he	made	15,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	cash	and	 b 	 ought 	 	the	house	that	i	grew	up	in	.
so	i	'm	not	that	 un 	 happy 	 	about	that	.
but	listen	,	i	did	feel	 oblig 	 ated 	 	to	him	,	and	i	grew	up	--	then	i	grew	up	.
and	i	'm	a	grown	woman	now	,	and	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
often	is	just	about	giving	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	,	or	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	what	you	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	or	it	's	about	giving	 un 	 til 	 	it	 hurt 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	about	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	the	 mean 	 s 	 	to	build	 some 	 thing 	 	that	will	grow	and	 intens 	 ify 	 	 it 	 s 	 	original	 invest 	 ment 	 	and	not	just	 requir 	 e 	 	 great 	 er 	 	giving	next	year	--	i	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	feed	the	habit	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	some	 year 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	how	good	 intent 	 ions 	 	for	community	 empower 	 ment 	 	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	there	to	support	the	community	and	empower	it	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	left	people	in	the	same	,	if	not	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	position	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	before	.
and	over	the	past	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	record	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	social	 problem 	 s 	 	,	yet	 education 	 al 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	,	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	,	 incarce 	 ration 	 	,	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	diabetes	,	income	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	,	they	've	all	gone	up	with	some	 exception 	 s 	 	--	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	among	people	in	poverty	--	but	it	's	a	great	world	that	we	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	i	know	a	little	bit	about	these	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	long	time	in	the	non	-	profit	industrial	complex	,	and	i	'm	a	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	director	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	clean	.
but	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	about	 project 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	them	on	the	local	level	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	going	to	do	the	right	thing	for	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	did	struggle	for	financial	support	.
the	 great 	 er 	 	our	success	,	the	less	money	came	in	from	 found 	 ations 	 	.
and	i	tell	you	,	 be 	 ing 	 	on	the	ted	stage	and	winning	a	macarthur	in	the	same	exact	year	 g 	 ave 	 	 every 	 one 	 	the	impression	that	i	had	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
and	by	the	time	i	'd	 move 	 d 	 	on	,	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	a	third	of	my	 age 	 ncy 	 	's	budget	 defici 	 t 	 	with	 s 	 peaking 	 	 fee 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	 be 	 cause 	 	early	on	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	my	 program 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	a	little	bit	 a 	 head 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	.
but	since	then	,	the	park	that	was	just	a	dump	and	was	 feature 	 d 	 	at	a	ted	2006	talk	 be 	 came 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	thing	.
but	i	did	in	fact	get	married	in	it	.
over	here	.
there	 go 	 es 	 	my	dog	who	led	me	to	the	park	in	my	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
the	south	bronx	 green 	 way 	 	was	 al 	 so 	 	just	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	on	the	stage	back	in	2006	.
since	then	,	we	got	about	50	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 stimul 	 us 	 	package	money	to	come	and	get	here	.
and	we	love	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	love	construction	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	happen	.
so	i	want	 every 	 one 	 	to	understand	the	critical	 import 	 ance 	 	of	shifting	 char 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	enterprise	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	firm	to	help	 commun 	 ities 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	 real 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	potential	to	improve	 every 	 thing 	 	about	the	quality	of	life	for	 the 	 ir 	 	people	.
 home 	 town 	 	security	is	next	on	my	to	-	do	list	.
what	we	need	are	people	who	see	the	value	in	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	local	 enterprise 	 s 	 	,	who	will	partner	with	 folk 	 s 	 	like	me	to	identify	the	growth	 trend 	 s 	 	and	climate	 adapt 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	understand	the	growing	social	 cost 	 s 	 	of	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.
we	need	to	work	together	to	embrace	and	repair	our	land	,	repair	our	power	 system 	 s 	 	and	repair	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
it	's	time	to	stop	building	the	 shop 	 ping 	 	 mall 	 s 	 	,	the	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	the	 stad 	 ium 	 s 	 	and	other	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	all	of	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	.
