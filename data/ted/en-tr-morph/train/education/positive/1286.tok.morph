meet	tony	.	he	's	my	student	.
he	's	about	my	age	,	and	he	's	in	san	quentin	state	 pri 	 son 	 	.
when	tony	was	16	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	one	day	,	one	moment	,	``	it	was	mom	's	gun	.
just	flash	it	,	 s 	 care 	 	the	guy	.	he	's	a	 pun 	 k 	 	.
he	took	some	money	;	we	'll	take	his	money	.	that	'll	teach	him	.
then	last	minute	,	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	'	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	wrong	.	'	my	 bud 	 dy 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	'	 c 	 ' 	 mon 	 	,	let	's	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	'	i	say	,	'	let	's	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	'	``	and	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 word 	 s 	 	,	tony	's	going	to	remember	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	next	thing	he	 know 	 s 	 	,	he	 hear 	 s 	 	the	pop	.
there	's	the	 pun 	 k 	 	on	the	ground	,	 pudd 	 le 	 	of	blood	.
and	that	's	 felon 	 y 	 	murder	--	25	to	life	,	 paro 	 le 	 	at	50	if	you	're	 luck 	 y 	 	,	and	tony	's	not	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	.
so	when	we	meet	in	my	 philosoph 	 y 	 	class	in	his	 pri 	 son 	 	and	i	say	,	``	in	 th 	 is 	 	class	,	we	will	discuss	the	 found 	 ations 	 	of	 ethic 	 s 	 	,	``	tony	 interrupt 	 s 	 	me	.
``	what	are	you	going	to	teach	me	about	right	and	wrong	?
i	know	what	is	wrong	.	i	have	 d 	 one 	 	wrong	.
i	am	told	every	day	,	by	every	face	i	see	,	every	wall	i	face	,	that	i	am	wrong	.
if	i	ever	get	out	of	here	,	there	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	a	mark	by	my	name	.
i	'm	a	convict	;	i	am	 brand 	 ed 	 	'	wrong	.	'	what	are	you	going	to	tell	me	about	right	and	wrong	?	``
so	i	say	to	tony	,	``	sorry	,	but	it	's	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	you	think	.
you	think	you	know	right	and	wrong	?
then	can	you	tell	me	what	wrong	is	?
no	,	do	n't	just	give	me	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
i	want	to	know	about	 wrong 	 ness 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	the	idea	of	wrong	.
what	is	that	idea	?
what	 make 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	?
how	do	we	know	that	it	's	wrong	?	 may 	 be 	 	you	and	i	disagree	.
 may 	 be 	 	one	of	us	is	wrong	about	the	wrong	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	you	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	me	--	but	we	're	not	here	to	trade	 opinion 	 s 	 	;	 every 	 one 	 	's	got	an	opinion	.
we	are	here	for	knowledge	.
our	 ene 	 my 	 	is	 thought 	 lessness 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.	``
and	 some 	 thing 	 	 change 	 s 	 	for	tony	.
``	could	be	i	'm	wrong	.	i	'm	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	wrong	.
i	want	to	know	what	is	wrong	.
i	want	to	know	what	i	know	.	``
what	tony	 s 	 ees 	 	in	that	moment	is	the	project	of	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	the	project	that	 begin 	 s 	 	in	wonder	--	what	kant	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 admi 	 ration 	 	and	awe	at	the	 star 	 ry 	 	sky	above	and	the	moral	law	 with 	 in 	 	.	``
what	can	 creature 	 s 	 	like	us	know	of	 s 	 uch 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	?
it	is	the	project	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 take 	 s 	 	us	back	to	the	condition	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	--	what	heidegger	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 al 	 ways 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	there	.	``
it	is	the	project	of	 question 	 ing 	 	what	we	 believ 	 e 	 	and	why	we	 believ 	 e 	 	it	--	what	socrates	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 examine 	 d 	 	life	.	``
socrates	,	a	man	wise	 en 	 ough 	 	to	know	that	he	 know 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
socrates	 di 	 ed 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	,	his	 philosoph 	 y 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	.
so	tony	 start 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	his	 home 	 work 	 	.
he	 learn 	 s 	 	his	 why 	 s 	 	and	 where 	 fore 	 s 	 	,	his	 cause 	 s 	 	and	 correlation 	 s 	 	,	his	logic	,	his	 fall 	 acies 	 	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	tony	's	got	the	 philosoph 	 y 	 	muscle	.
his	body	is	in	 pri 	 son 	 	,	but	his	mind	is	free	.
tony	 learn 	 s 	 	about	the	 onto 	 logically 	 	 promisc 	 uous 	 	,	the	 epistemo 	 logically 	 	 anx 	 ious 	 	,	the	 ethic 	 ally 	 	 dub 	 ious 	 	,	the	 meta 	 physical 	 ly 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
that	's	plato	,	descartes	,	nietzsche	and	bill	clinton	.
so	when	he	 give 	 s 	 	me	his	final	paper	,	in	which	he	 argu 	 es 	 	that	the	 categor 	 ical 	 	 imper 	 ative 	 	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	too	 un 	 com 	 promising 	 	to	deal	with	the	conflict	that	 affect 	 s 	 	our	 every 	 day 	 	and	 challeng 	 es 	 	me	to	tell	him	 whet 	 her 	 	 there 	 fore 	 	we	are	 condemn 	 ed 	 	to	moral	failure	,	i	say	,	``	i	do	n't	know	.
let	us	think	about	that	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	in	that	moment	,	there	's	no	mark	by	tony	's	name	;	it	's	just	the	two	of	us	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	.
it	is	not	professor	and	convict	,	it	is	just	two	 mind 	 s 	 	ready	to	do	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
and	i	say	to	tony	,	``	let	's	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
thank	you	.
