i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	you	 to 	 day 	 	in	all	 humil 	 ity 	 	,	 want 	 ing 	 	to	share	with	you	my	journey	of	the	last	six	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	field	of	service	and	education	.
and	i	'm	not	a	trained	academic	.
 n 	 either 	 	am	i	a	veteran	social	 work 	 er 	 	.
i	was	26	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	corporate	world	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 profit 	 able 	 	.
and	then	in	2003	i	 start 	 ed 	 	parikrma	 human 	 ity 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	from	my	kitchen	table	.
the	first	thing	that	we	did	was	walk	through	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	by	the	way	,	there	are	two	million	people	in	bangalore	,	who	live	in	800	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	.
we	could	n't	go	to	all	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	,	but	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	cover	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	.
we	 walk 	 ed 	 	through	these	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	,	identified	 house 	 s 	 	where	children	would	never	go	to	school	.
we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	the	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	them	about	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	to	school	.
we	 play 	 ed 	 	with	the	children	,	and	came	back	home	 re 	 ally 	 	 tire 	 d 	 	,	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	,	but	with	 image 	 s 	 	of	bright	 face 	 s 	 	,	 twinkl 	 ing 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	went	to	sleep	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	start	,	but	the	 number 	 s 	 	hit	us	then	:	200	million	children	between	four	to	14	that	should	be	going	to	school	,	but	do	not	;	100	million	children	who	go	to	school	but	can	not	read	;	125	million	who	can	not	do	 bas 	 ic 	 	 math 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	heard	that	250	billion	indian	 rupee 	 s 	 	was	 dedicate 	 d 	 	for	government	 school 	 ing 	 	.
ninety	percent	of	it	was	 s 	 pent 	 	on	 teacher 	 s 	 	'	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	and	 administr 	 ators 	 	'	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	.
and	yet	,	india	 ha 	 s 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	the	highest	teacher	 absent 	 ee 	 ism 	 	in	the	world	,	with	one	out	of	four	 teacher 	 s 	 	not	going	to	school	at	all	the	entire	academic	year	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	mind	-	boggling	,	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	when	will	you	start	?	how	 man 	 y 	 	 school 	 s 	 	will	you	start	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	children	will	you	get	?
how	are	you	going	to	scale	?
how	are	you	going	to	replicate	?	``
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	not	to	get	 scar 	 ed 	 	,	not	to	get	 daunt 	 ed 	 	.
but	we	 d 	 ug 	 	our	 heel 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	're	not	in	the	number	game	.
we	want	to	take	one	child	at	a	time	and	take	the	child	right	through	school	,	 s 	 ent 	 	to	college	,	and	get	them	prepared	for	better	living	,	a	high	value	job	.	``
so	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	parikrma	.
the	first	parikrma	school	 start 	 ed 	 	in	a	 s 	 lum 	 	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	70,000	people	living	 be 	 low 	 	the	poverty	line	.
our	first	school	was	on	a	 roof 	 top 	 	of	a	building	 in 	 side 	 	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	,	a	second	story	building	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	second	story	building	 in 	 side 	 	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 roof 	 top 	 	did	not	have	any	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	half	a	tin	sheet	.
that	was	our	first	school	.	one	hundred	sixty	-	five	children	.
indian	academic	year	 begin 	 s 	 	in	june	.
so	,	june	it	 rain 	 s 	 	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	a	 time 	 s 	 	all	of	us	would	be	 huddl 	 ed 	 	under	the	tin	roof	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	rain	to	stop	.
my	god	!	what	a	 bond 	 ing 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	that	was	.
and	all	of	us	that	 we 	 re 	 	under	that	roof	are	still	here	together	 to 	 day 	 	.
then	came	the	second	school	,	the	third	school	,	the	fourth	school	and	a	 juni 	 or 	 	college	.
in	six	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	we	have	four	 school 	 s 	 	,	one	 juni 	 or 	 	college	,	1,100	children	coming	from	28	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	and	four	 orphan 	 age 	 s 	 	.
our	dream	is	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	:	to	 s 	 end 	 	each	of	these	 kid 	 s 	 	,	get	them	prepared	to	be	educated	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	live	 peace 	 fully 	 	,	 content 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	conflict	-	ridden	chaotic	 global 	 ized 	 	world	.
now	,	when	you	talk	global	you	have	to	talk	english	.
and	so	all	our	 school 	 s 	 	are	english	medium	 school 	 s 	 	.
but	they	know	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	myth	that	children	from	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	can	not	speak	english	well	.
no	one	in	 the 	 ir 	 	family	 ha 	 s 	 	spoken	english	.
no	one	in	 the 	 ir 	 	generation	 ha 	 s 	 	spoken	english	.
but	how	wrong	it	is	.
girl	:	i	like	 ad 	 vent 	 ur 	 ous 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	some	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	are	alfred	hitchcock	and	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	and	 hard 	 y 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	are	like	in	different	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	,	one	is	 magic 	 al 	 	,	the	other	two	are	like	investigation	,	i	like	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	 some 	 thing 	 	special	in	them	.
the	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	used	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	and	the	style	of	writing	.
i	mean	like	once	i	pick	up	one	book	i	can	not	put	it	down	 un 	 til 	 	i	finish	the	whole	book	.
even	if	it	 take 	 s 	 	me	four	and	a	half	 hour 	 s 	 	,	or	three	and	half	 hour 	 s 	 	to	finish	my	book	,	i	do	it	.
boy	:	i	did	good	research	and	i	got	the	information	[	on	the	]	world	's	 fast 	 est 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
i	like	ducati	zz	143	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	the	 fast 	 est 	 	,	the	world	's	 fast 	 est 	 	bike	,	and	i	like	 puls 	 ar 	 	220	dtsi	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	india	's	 fast 	 est 	 	bike	.
shukla	bose	:	well	,	that	girl	that	you	saw	,	her	father	 sell 	 s 	 	 flower 	 s 	 	on	the	 road 	 side 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	little	boy	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	coming	to	school	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	is	n't	it	strange	that	little	 boy 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	love	fast	 bike 	 s 	 	?
he	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 s 	 een 	 	one	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	ridden	one	,	of	course	,	but	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	of	research	through	google	search	.
you	know	,	when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	our	english	medium	 school 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 so 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	adopt	the	best	curriculum	possible	,	the	icse	curriculum	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	people	who	 laugh 	 ed 	 	at	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	be	crazy	 choos 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	tough	curriculum	for	these	 student 	 s 	 	.
they	'll	never	be	able	to	cope	.	``
not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	our	children	cope	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	but	they	excel	in	it	.
you	should	just	come	 a 	 cross 	 	to	see	how	well	our	children	do	.
there	is	 al 	 so 	 	 th 	 is 	 	myth	that	 parent 	 s 	 	from	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	are	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	children	going	to	school	;	they	'd	much	 ra 	 ther 	 	put	them	to	work	.
that	's	absolute	 hog 	 wash 	 	.
all	 parent 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	want	 the 	 ir 	 	children	to	lead	a	better	life	than	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	but	they	need	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	change	is	possible	.
video	:	sb	:	we	have	80	percent	 attend 	 ance 	 	for	all	our	 parent 	 s 	 	-	 teacher 	 s 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	even	100	percent	,	much	more	than	 man 	 y 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
 father 	 s 	 	have	 start 	 ed 	 	to	attend	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	our	school	the	 parent 	 s 	 	would	give	 thumb 	 print 	 s 	 	in	the	 attend 	 ance 	 	register	.
now	they	have	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	 the 	 ir 	 	signature	.
the	children	have	taught	them	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	how	much	children	can	teach	.
we	have	,	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	late	last	year	,	we	had	a	few	 mother 	 s 	 	who	came	to	us	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	we	want	to	learn	how	to	read	and	write	.
can	you	teach	us	?	``	so	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	an	 after 	 school 	 	for	our	 parent 	 s 	 	,	for	our	 mother 	 s 	 	.
we	had	25	 mother 	 s 	 	who	came	 regular 	 ly 	 	after	school	to	 stud 	 y 	 	.
we	want	to	 continu 	 e 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	program	and	extend	it	to	all	our	other	 school 	 s 	 	.
ninety	-	eight	percent	of	our	 father 	 s 	 	are	 alcohol 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	can	imagine	how	 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 	and	how	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	the	 house 	 s 	 	are	where	our	children	come	from	.
we	have	to	 s 	 end 	 	the	 father 	 s 	 	to	de	-	 addict 	 ion 	 	 lab 	 s 	 	and	when	they	come	back	,	most	 time 	 s 	 	sober	,	we	have	to	find	a	job	for	them	so	that	they	do	n't	regress	.
we	have	about	three	 father 	 s 	 	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	trained	to	cook	.
we	have	taught	them	nutrition	,	 hygien 	 e 	 	.
we	have	 help 	 ed 	 	them	set	up	the	kitchen	and	now	they	are	 supply 	 ing 	 	food	to	all	our	children	.
they	do	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	job	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	are	eating	 the 	 ir 	 	food	,	but	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	time	they	have	got	respect	,	and	they	feel	that	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 worth 	 while 	 	.
more	than	90	percent	of	our	non	-	 teach 	 ing 	 	staff	are	all	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 extend 	 ed 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 program 	 s 	 	just	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	child	 come 	 s 	 	to	school	.

there	is	 al 	 so 	 	 th 	 is 	 	myth	that	children	from	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	can	not	integrate	with	 main 	 stream 	 	.
take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	who	was	one	of	the	28	children	from	all	 privilege 	 d 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	best	 school 	 s 	 	in	the	country	that	was	 select 	 ed 	 	for	the	 du 	 ke 	 	university	talent	 ident 	 ification 	 	program	and	was	 s 	 ent 	 	to	iim	ahmedabad	.
video	:	girl	:	 du 	 ke 	 	iima	camp	.	 when 	 ever 	 	we	see	that	iima	,	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 pri 	 de 	 	for	us	to	go	to	that	camp	.
 every 	 body 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	friendly	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	i	got	a	lot	of	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	i	felt	that	my	english	 ha 	 s 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	a	lot	going	there	and	 chat 	 ting 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	.
there	they	met	children	who	are	with	a	different	standard	and	a	different	 mind 	 set 	 	,	a	 total 	 ly 	 	different	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
i	 mingle 	 d 	 	with	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 one 	 	.

i	had	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 friend 	 s 	 	there	,	who	are	from	delhi	,	who	are	from	mumbai	.
even	now	we	are	in	touch	through	facebook	.
after	 th 	 is 	 	ahmedabad	trip	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	like	a	 total 	 ly 	 	different	 ming 	 ling 	 	with	people	and	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
before	that	i	feel	like	i	was	n't	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	do	n't	even	mingle	,	or	start	 s 	 peaking 	 	with	 some 	 one 	 	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	.

and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 foot 	 ball 	 	,	 vol 	 ley 	 ball 	 	,	frisbee	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 game 	 s 	 	.
and	i	would	n't	want	to	go	to	bangalore	.	let	me	stay	here	.

sb	:	 th 	 is 	 	girl	was	 work 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	maid	before	she	came	to	school	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	she	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 neuro 	 logist 	 	.
our	children	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	in	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 excel 	 ling 	 	.
there	is	an	inter	-	school	athletic	 com 	 petition 	 	that	is	held	every	year	in	bangalore	,	where	5,000	children	 particip 	 ate 	 	from	140	best	 school 	 s 	 	in	the	city	.
we	've	got	the	best	school	 a 	 ward 	 	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	 success 	 ively 	 	.
and	our	children	are	coming	back	home	with	 bag 	 s 	 	full	of	 med 	 al 	 s 	 	,	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 admire 	 rs 	 	and	 friend 	 s 	 	.
last	year	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	couple	of	 kid 	 s 	 	from	elite	 school 	 s 	 	that	came	to	ask	for	 ad 	 mission 	 s 	 	in	our	school	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	our	 ver 	 y 	 	own	dream	team	.
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	?	why	 th 	 is 	 	confidence	?
is	it	the	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	?	we	have	 professor 	 s 	 	from	mit	,	berkeley	,	stanford	,	indian	institute	of	science	who	come	and	teach	our	children	 lot 	 s 	 	of	scientific	 formula 	 s 	 	,	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	much	beyond	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
art	,	music	are	 consider 	 ed 	 	therapy	and	 medium 	 s 	 	of	 express 	 ion 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	's	the	content	that	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	is	not	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	not	the	 toilet 	 s 	 	,	not	the	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	,	but	it	is	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	school	that	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.
creating	an	environment	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	of	 inquir 	 y 	 	,	of	exploration	is	what	is	true	education	.
when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	parikrma	we	had	no	idea	which	direction	we	 we 	 re 	 	taking	.
we	did	n't	hire	mckinsey	to	do	a	business	plan	.
but	we	know	for	 s 	 ure 	 	that	what	we	want	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	take	one	child	at	a	time	,	not	get	 bog 	 ged 	 	with	 number 	 s 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	the	child	complete	the	circle	of	life	,	and	unleash	his	total	potential	.
we	do	not	 believ 	 e 	 	in	scale	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	quality	,	and	scale	and	 number 	 s 	 	will	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	happen	.
we	have	 corporate 	 s 	 	that	have	stood	 be 	 hind 	 	us	,	and	we	are	able	to	,	now	,	open	more	 school 	 s 	 	.
but	we	 beg 	 an 	 	with	the	idea	of	one	child	at	a	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	five	-	year	-	old	parusharam	.
he	was	 beg 	 ging 	 	by	a	bus	stop	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	got	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	and	is	now	in	an	 orphan 	 age 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	coming	to	school	for	the	last	four	and	a	half	 month 	 s 	 	.
he	's	in	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	speak	english	.
we	have	a	model	by	which	 kid 	 s 	 	can	speak	english	and	understand	english	in	three	month	's	time	.
he	can	tell	you	 st 	 ories 	 	in	english	of	the	 thirst 	 y 	 	crow	,	of	the	crocodile	and	of	the	giraffe	.
and	if	you	ask	him	what	he	 like 	 s 	 	to	do	he	will	say	,	``	i	like	 sleep 	 ing 	 	.
i	like	eating	.	i	like	 play 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	if	you	ask	him	what	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	do	,	he	will	say	,	``	i	want	to	 hor 	 s 	 ing 	 	.	``
now	,	``	 hor 	 s 	 ing 	 	``	is	going	for	a	horse	ride	.
so	,	parusharam	 come 	 s 	 	to	my	 off 	 ice 	 	every	day	.
he	 come 	 s 	 	for	a	tummy	rub	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 believ 	 es 	 	that	will	give	me	luck	.
when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	parikrma	i	 beg 	 an 	 	with	a	great	deal	of	 arrog 	 ance 	 	of	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	world	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	.
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 change 	 d 	 	with	my	children	.
i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	so	much	from	them	:	love	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 imagin 	 ation 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
with	a	simple	 begin 	 ning 	 	but	a	long	way	to	go	.
i	promise	you	,	parusharam	will	speak	in	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	.
thank	you	.
