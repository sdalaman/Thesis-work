sixty	-	five	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	and	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	event	 change 	 d 	 	the	course	of	life	on	land	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	know	that	the	land	 animal 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	are	just	the	 s 	 cum 	 	of	the	earth	on	the	land	--	the	little	bits	of	land	 float 	 ing 	 	around	--	but	they	are	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	sort	of	in	our	scale	of	experience	from	 millimeter 	 s 	 	to	 meter 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 animal 	 s 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	and	a	 separat 	 e 	 	life	,	 mammal 	 s 	 	,	 radiate 	 d 	 	out	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	place	.	and	so	,	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	in	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	detail	.	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	core	from	near	bermuda	.	we	know	that	the	 tsunami 	 s 	 	,	the	 earth 	 quake 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 experience 	 d 	 	in	the	entire	record	of	 human 	 kind 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	get	around	the	kind	of	disaster	that	 th 	 is 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	for	the	earth	.
so	even	before	that	impact	was	known	,	even	before	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	general	came	to	an	 agree 	 ment 	 	over	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	evolution	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	natural	 historian 	 s 	 	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 strip 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 divid 	 ed 	 	earth	's	life	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	two	 episode 	 s 	 	:	mesozoic	,	the	middle	life	,	and	the	cenozoic	,	the	 re 	 cent 	 	life	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 correspond 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	with	 geo 	 logic 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
so	we	have	a	mesozoic	period	,	an	age	of	 fragment 	 ation 	 	,	and	a	cenozoic	period	,	an	age	of	 re 	 connect 	 ion 	 	--	south	america	to	north	america	,	india	to	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
and	so	my	work	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	character	of	that	mesozoic	 radi 	 ation 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	cenozoic	 radi 	 ation 	 	to	see	what	 myster 	 ies 	 	we	can	understand	from	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	and	from	other	 animal 	 s 	 	about	what	life	on	 drift 	 ing 	 	 continent 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	can	tell	us	about	evolution	.
the	work	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 s 	 	the	question	,	``	why	did	n't	they	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 water 	 s 	 	?	``
i	mean	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	 mammal 	 s 	 	did	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
you	can	go	 out 	 side 	 	--	see	 man 	 y 	 	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
 with 	 in 	 	five	,	10	million	 year 	 s 	 	of	the	 boli 	 de 	 	impact	we	had	a	whole	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.	why	did	n't	they	do	that	?
why	did	n't	they	hang	around	in	 tree 	 s 	 	at	good	 s 	 ize 	 	,	and	why	did	n't	they	burrow	?
why	did	n't	they	do	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	if	they	did	n't	do	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 space 	 s 	 	?
and	if	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 animal 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	tell	us	about	,	you	know	,	how	evolution	 work 	 s 	 	on	land	?
 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.	i	think	a	lot	of	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	body	 s 	 ize 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	think	that	most	of	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	body	 s 	 ize 	 	--	the	 s 	 ize 	 	you	are	when	you	inherit	a	 vac 	 ant 	 	 eco 	 space 	 	from	 what 	 ever 	 	natural	disaster	.
looking	at	dinosaur	evolution	and	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	it	,	 dig 	 ging 	 	it	up	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	end	up	looking	at	the	mammal	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	is	quick	time	,	just	like	technology	,	 advanc 	 ing 	 	by	an	order	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	.
dinosaur	evolution	 proceed 	 ed 	 	at	a	 state 	 ly 	 	pace	,	an	order	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	 s 	 lower 	 	on	any	way	you	want	to	measure	it	.
you	want	to	measure	it	by	 divers 	 ity 	 	?
you	want	to	measure	it	by	the	time	it	took	to	reach	 maxim 	 um 	 	body	 s 	 ize 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	they	do	have	 large 	 r 	 	body	 s 	 ize 	 	,	but	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	 small 	 er 	 	,	but	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	time	it	took	them	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	.
fifty	million	 year 	 s 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 maxim 	 um 	 	body	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	that	is	10	 time 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	than	it	took	the	 mammal 	 s 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 maxim 	 um 	 	body	 s 	 ize 	 	and	 invad 	 e 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	.
so	there	's	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	to	learn	,	and	there	's	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	to	learn	from	the	exception	,	the	exception	that	we	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 to 	 day 	 	from	the	 discover 	 ies 	 	we	've	made	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 scholar 	 s 	 	have	made	around	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	slide	was	 show 	 n 	 	before	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	famous	jurassic	bird	 arch 	 aeopteryx 	 	.
we	now	know	 th 	 is 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	is	the	one	time	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	 be 	 low 	 	that	body	 s 	 ize 	 	--	we	're	going	to	see	where	they	 beg 	 an 	 	in	a	minute	--	and	it	is	the	one	time	that	they	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 invad 	 ed 	 	all	the	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	i	just	told	you	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	in	.
they	 be 	 came 	 	marine	.	we	now	know	them	 to 	 day 	 	from	the	ice	 cap 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 burrow 	 ing 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	.
they	inhabit	the	 tree 	 s 	 	at	all	body	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	,	and	,	of	course	,	they	inhabit	the	land	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	name	a	bird	from	the	famous	 s 	 eries 	 	that	 lat 	 er 	 	 explode 	 d 	 	onto	the	 page 	 s 	 	of	science	and	nature	.
we	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	bird	sinornis	.	it	's	a	little	bit	more	 advance 	 d 	 	than	 arch 	 aeopteryx 	 	,	and	if	you	go	to	different	 layer 	 s 	 	,	you	find	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	less	 advance 	 d 	 	than	 arch 	 aeopteryx 	 	,	and	every	grade	in	between	,	so	that	if	you	find	 some 	 thing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	're	 usual 	 ly 	 	 split 	 ting 	 	 hair 	 s 	 	--	or	,	more	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	,	 feather 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	to	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	non	-	 av 	 ian 	 	or	an	 av 	 ian 	 	.
it	is	the	 great 	 est 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	that	we	have	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	on	land	from	one	 habit 	 at 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	,	bar	 non 	 e 	 	,	to	understand	how	a	 bon 	 y 	 	,	 fair 	 ly 	 	heavy	,	 kilo 	 gram 	 	or	a	couple	-	of	-	 kilo 	 gram 	 	animal	could	make	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 transit 	 ion 	 	.
it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	our	 great 	 est 	 	--	one	of	our	 great 	 est 	 	--	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
now	,	my	work	 beg 	 an 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
i	thought	if	i	'm	going	to	understand	dinosaur	evolution	,	i	'd	have	to	go	back	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 bed 	 s 	 	where	they	had	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	 fragment 	 s 	 	,	go	back	to	a	time	and	a	place	where	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	call	for	 th 	 is 	 	little	video	clip	to	give	you	some	idea	of	,	sort	of	,	what	we	face	.	 normal 	 ly 	 	,	we	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 question 	 s 	 	:	``	well	,	how	do	you	find	 fossil 	 s 	 	in	 area 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
if	we	could	roll	that	first	video	clip	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	a	nice	helicopter	ride	through	 t 	 hose 	 	early	 bed 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 locate 	 d 	 	in	 north 	 eastern 	 	argentina	.
and	we	're	coming	over	a	cliff	,	and	at	the	top	of	that	cliff	,	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	had	 bas 	 ically 	 	taken	over	.
at	the	bottom	of	the	cliff	,	we	find	that	they	're	rare	 a 	 s 	 	hens	'	 tee 	 th 	 	.
that	's	where	dinosaur	 origin 	 s 	 	is	to	be	found	:	at	the	bottom	of	the	cliff	.
you	go	 in 	 to 	 	an	area	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	get	a	 geo 	 logic 	 	map	,	you	get	a	 topo 	 graphic 	 	map	,	and	the	best	,	most	-	inspired	team	you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	to	the	area	.
and	the	rest	is	up	to	you	.	you	've	got	to	find	 fossil 	 s 	 	.
you	've	got	to	dig	a	hole	that	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	 big 	 ger 	 	than	that	to	get	it	out	;	you	've	got	to	climb	 t 	 hose 	 	 cliff 	 s 	 	and	find	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 exist 	 ed 	 	--	not	just	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	but	the	entire	story	.	if	you	're	 luck 	 y 	 	,	and	you	dig	a	place	like	that	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	find	the	ash	bed	to	dig	it	,	and	we	did	.
228	million	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	we	found	what	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	most	primitive	dinosaur	:	that	's	the	ur	-	dinosaur	.
a	three	-	and	-	a	-	half	foot	thing	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	skull	,	predator	,	meat	-	eater	,	a	two	-	legged	animal	.
so	,	all	the	other	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	that	you	know	,	or	your	 kid 	 s 	 	know	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	on	four	 leg 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	a	look	at	the	skull	,	and	it	's	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fantastic	thing	about	five	or	six	 inch 	 es 	 	long	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	bird	-	like	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	.
it	's	bird	-	like	and	hollow	.
a	predator	.	 may 	 be 	 	25	 pound 	 s 	 	,	or	10	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	.
that	's	where	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	.	that	's	where	the	 radi 	 ation 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	.
that	is	10	 time 	 s 	 	 large 	 r 	 	than	the	mammal	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	which	was	a	four	-	legged	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
we	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	dinosaur	-	like	,	and	 un 	 usual 	 	in	our	two	-	legged	approach	to	life	.
now	,	if	you	want	to	understand	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	then	when	the	 continent 	 s 	 	broke	 a 	 part 	 	,	and	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	found	--	 landlubb 	 ers 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	--	found	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 drift 	 	.	there	's	some	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	are	southern	 continent 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 t 	 hose 	 	 continent 	 s 	 	that	are	 l 	 east 	 	 explore 	 d 	 	.
if	you	want	to	add	to	 th 	 is 	 	picture	and	try	and	sketch	it	 global 	 ly 	 	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	force	 your 	 self 	 	to	go	down	to	the	four	 corner 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	--	africa	,	india	,	antarctica	,	australia	--	and	start	 put 	 ting 	 	together	some	of	these	 piece 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 continent 	 s 	 	,	but	africa	was	,	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	steven	pinker	,	was	a	blank	 s 	 late 	 	,	 large 	 ly 	 	.
but	one	with	an	immense	 chalk 	 board 	 	in	the	middle	,	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	little	 area 	 s 	 	of	dinosaur	rock	if	you	could	 surviv 	 e 	 	an	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	.
there	's	no	 road 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sahara	.	it	's	an	enormous	place	.
to	be	able	to	 excav 	 ate 	 	the	80	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	that	we	have	in	the	sahara	and	take	them	out	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	put	together	an	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	team	that	can	handle	the	 condition 	 s 	 	.
some	of	them	are	 politic 	 al 	 	.	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	physical	.
some	of	them	--	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	--	are	mental	.
and	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	be	able	to	 with 	 stand 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	--	you	have	to	drive	 in 	 to 	 	the	desert	,	you	will	see	 land 	 scapes 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	--	you	can	see	from	what	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	--	that	 no 	 body 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
and	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 team 	 s 	 	they	 br 	 ing 	 	in	?

these	are	the	tuareg	 nomad 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	living	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	they	have	for	centuries	.
your	job	is	to	 excav 	 ate 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	,	and	make	them	enter	the	 page 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
to	do	that	,	you	've	got	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	transport	them	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	out	of	the	desert	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	ethiopia	,	but	let	's	talk	about	niger	--	or	niger	,	in	our	english	language	--	north	of	nigeria	--	that	's	where	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	was	taken	.

that	's	a	2,000	mile	journey	.
so	enormous	 excav 	 ations 	 	and	a	lot	of	work	,	and	out	of	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	partial	herd	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	that	you	saw	buried	there	--	20	 ton 	 s 	 	of	material	--	we	erect	jobaria	,	a	sauropod	dinosaur	like	we	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	on	some	other	 continent 	 s 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	a	thumb	claw	.	there	it	was	,	 moment 	 s 	 	after	it	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	.

when	you	pick	up	a	piece	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	like	that	,	i	think	it	can	transform	 kid 	 s 	 	that	are	possibly	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	science	.
that	's	the	animal	that	thumb	claw	came	from	:	suchomimus	.
here	's	some	 other 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	found	in	morocco	,	an	immense	animal	.
we	 prototype 	 d 	 	by	cat	-	 s 	 canning 	 	the	brain	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	animal	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	have	a	 fore 	 brain 	 	one	-	fifteenth	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	human	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	cover	of	science	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	thought	that	 human 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	intelligent	than	these	 animal 	 s 	 	,	but	we	can	see	by	some	in	our	 administr 	 ation 	 	that	 de 	 spite 	 	the	enormous	advantage	in	brain	volume	some	of	the	 attitude 	 s 	 	remain	the	same	.	 any 	 way 	 	,	all	the	stuff	from	jurassic	park	that	you	know	of	--	all	 t 	 hose 	 	small	 animal 	 s 	 	--	they	all	come	from	 north 	 ern 	 	 continent 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	skeleton	from	a	southern	continent	,	and	guess	what	?	you	start	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	it	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	big	claw	on	 it 	 s 	 	hind	foot	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	a	 velo 	 ciraptor 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 who 	 lly 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
so	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	piece	together	here	is	a	story	.
it	 involve 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 reptil 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	pterosaur	that	we	 re 	 construct 	 ed 	 	from	africa	.
 crocodile 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	and	that	's	a	nasty	one	we	have	n't	named	yet	.
and	huge	 thing 	 s 	 	--	i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	lower	jaw	just	 lay 	 ing 	 	there	in	the	desert	of	 th 	 is 	 	enormous	crocodile	.
the	crocodile	is	 technical 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	sarcosuchus	.
that	's	an	adult	orinoco	crocodile	in	 it 	 s 	 	 jaw 	 s 	 	.
we	had	to	try	and	 re 	 construct 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	had	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	 re 	 cent 	 	 crocodile 	 s 	 	to	understand	how	 crocodile 	 s 	 	scale	.
could	i	have	the	second	little	video	clip	?
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	field	is	just	--	and	,	of	course	,	science	in	general	--	is	just	--	adventure	.
we	had	to	find	and	measure	the	largest	 crocodile 	 s 	 	living	 to 	 day 	 	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	...	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	boat	.
man	:	look	at	that	set	of	 chop 	 per 	 s 	 	!	 yea 	 h 	 	,	he	's	a	big	one	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	if	they	can	just	land	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	croc	will	provide	 use 	 ful 	 	data	,	 help 	 ing 	 	paul	in	his	quest	to	understand	sarcosuchus	.
man	:	ok	,	hand	me	some	more	here	.	man	2	:	ok	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	it	 fall 	 s 	 	to	paul	to	cover	 it 	 s 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.

man	2	:	you	have	the	back	 leg 	 s 	 	?	no	,	you	have	the	front	 leg 	 s 	 	,	my	friend	.
i	've	got	it	.	i	've	got	the	back	 leg 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	get	the	front	 leg 	 s 	 	.
paul	sereno	:	let	's	get	 th 	 is 	 	tape	measure	on	him	.	put	it	right	there	.
 w 	 ow 	 	.
sixty	-	five	.	 w 	 ow 	 	.
that	's	a	big	skull	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	big	,	but	less	than	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 super 	 croc 	 	's	skull	.
man	:	enormous	.	ps	:	you	've	got	a	...	14	-	foot	croc	.

 nar 	 rator 	 	:	paul	 ha 	 s 	 	his	data	,	so	they	decide	to	 re 	 lease 	 	the	animal	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	river	.

 nar 	 rator 	 	:	paul	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	fossil	do	that	.
ps	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	when	i	say	three	,	we	move	.
one	,	two	,	three	!
 who 	 a 	 	!
so	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	--	well	,	you	know	,	the	--	the	fossil	record	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 force 	 s 	 	you	to	look	at	living	 animal 	 s 	 	in	a	new	way	.
we	 prov 	 ed 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 measure 	 ments 	 	that	 crocodile 	 s 	 	 scale 	 d 	 	 iso 	 metric 	 ally 	 	.
it	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	the	shape	of	 the 	 ir 	 	skull	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	so	we	had	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 measure 	 ments 	 	to	be	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	had	 re 	 construct 	 ed 	 	and	could	prove	to	the	scientific	world	that	 super 	 croc 	 	in	fact	is	a	40	-	foot	crocodile	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	male	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	you	find	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	too	.
i	'm	going	to	lead	an	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	to	the	sahara	to	dig	up	africa	's	largest	 neo 	 lith 	 ic 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
we	found	 th 	 is 	 	last	year	.
two	hundred	 skeleton 	 s 	 	,	 tool 	 s 	 	,	 jewel 	 ry 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ceremoni 	 al 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	.
an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	record	of	the	 colon 	 ization 	 	of	the	sahara	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	is	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	out	there	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	us	to	go	back	.	so	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	work	 lat 	 er 	 	is	going	to	take	us	to	tibet	.
now	,	we	 normal 	 ly 	 	think	of	tibet	 a 	 s 	 	a	 high 	 land 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 is 	 land 	 	continent	.
it	was	a	 pre 	 cursor 	 	to	india	,	a	messenger	from	gondwana	--	a	lost	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
no	one	's	found	them	.	we	know	where	they	are	,	and	we	're	going	to	go	and	get	them	next	year	.
they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	between	13	and	14,000	feet	,	but	if	you	go	in	the	warm	part	of	the	year	,	it	's	o.k	.
now	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 sutur 	 e 	 	together	a	dinosaur	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	so	that	we	can	try	to	understand	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	evolution	.
i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	a	few	of	them	.	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	take	that	further	.
we	need	to	delve	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mass	of	anatomy	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 compil 	 ing 	 	to	understand	where	the	 change 	 s 	 	are	 occur 	 ring 	 	and	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
we	ca	n't	predict	,	 necess 	 arily 	 	,	what	will	happen	in	evolution	,	but	we	can	learn	some	of	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	the	game	,	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
with	regard	to	the	 bio 	 geo 	 graphic 	 	question	,	the	earth	is	 divid 	 ing 	 	.
these	are	all	 landlubb 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.	there	's	a	couple	of	 choice 	 s 	 	.
you	get	 divid 	 ed 	 	,	and	a	continent	's	division	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	a	 for 	 k 	 	in	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	tree	,	or	you	're	 craft 	 y 	 	,	and	you	manage	to	 es 	 cape 	 	from	one	to	the	other	and	 er 	 ase 	 	that	division	,	or	you	're	living	 peace 	 fully 	 	on	each	side	,	and	on	one	side	you	just	go	extinct	,	and	you	 surviv 	 e 	 	on	the	other	side	and	create	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	the	fourth	thing	is	that	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	one	or	the	other	of	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 paleonto 	 logist 	 	never	found	you	.
and	you	take	 t 	 hose 	 	four	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	and	you	 real 	 ize 	 	you	have	a	complex	problem	.
and	so	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 dig 	 ging 	 	,	i	think	we	have	some	 answer 	 s 	 	from	the	dinosaur	record	.	i	think	these	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 migr 	 ated 	 	--	we	call	it	 dispers 	 al 	 	--	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	with	the	 s 	 light 	 est 	 	land	bridge	.
they	did	it	 with 	 in 	 	two	or	three	 degree 	 s 	 	of	the	pole	,	to	maintain	 similar 	 ity 	 	between	 continent 	 s 	 	.
but	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	do	see	the	 continent 	 s 	 	 carv 	 ing 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	among	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
but	there	's	one	thing	that	's	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	i	think	that	's	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.
we	have	 down 	 grad 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	factor	.
it	 carve 	 s 	 	up	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	life	,	and	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	that	we	see	in	the	dinosaur	world	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	end	,	right	before	the	 boli 	 de 	 	impact	.
the	best	way	to	test	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	a	model	.
so	if	we	move	back	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	two	-	dimensional	typical	tree	of	life	.
i	want	to	give	you	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
so	you	see	the	tree	of	life	,	but	now	i	've	 add 	 ed 	 	the	dimension	of	area	.
so	the	tree	of	life	is	 normal 	 ly 	 	 diverge 	 nce 	 	over	time	.
now	we	have	 diverge 	 nce 	 	over	time	,	but	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	the	third	dimension	of	area	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	computer	program	which	 ha 	 s 	 	three	 knob 	 s 	 	.
we	can	control	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	:	 extinct 	 ion 	 	,	 s 	 ampl 	 ing 	 	,	 dispers 	 al 	 	--	going	from	one	area	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	we	can	control	the	 branch 	 ing 	 	to	mimic	what	we	think	the	 continent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	and	run	it	a	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	,	so	we	can	estimate	the	 parameter 	 s 	 	,	to	answer	the	question	 whet 	 her 	 	we	are	on	the	mark	or	not	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	to	know	the	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	.	so	that	's	a	little	bit	about	the	science	.
 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	rest	of	my	few	 minute 	 s 	 	up	here	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	other	stuff	that	i	do	in	chicago	,	which	is	related	to	the	fact	that	i	never	--	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	a	lot	of	tedsters	,	there	's	a	number	of	you	out	there	--	i	do	n't	know	that	i	'd	get	an	answer	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	if	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	to	raise	your	hand	,	but	there	are	a	number	of	you	out	there	that	 start 	 ed 	 	your	scientific	,	technical	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	,	by	 socie 	 ty 	 	's	 standard 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	by	 school 	 s 	 	.
i	was	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.	i	was	 fail 	 ed 	 	by	my	school	--	my	school	 fail 	 ed 	 	me	.
who	's	 point 	 ing 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	?
 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	me	.
i	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	art	.
i	was	a	total	failure	in	school	,	not	 re 	 ally 	 	headed	to	graduate	high	school	.
and	i	went	on	--	that	's	my	first	 paint 	 ing 	 	on	canvas	.
i	read	a	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.	i	got	 in 	 to 	 	college	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	an	artist	.	o.k	.	,	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	abstract	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	up	a	portfolio	,	and	i	was	headed	to	new	york	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	would	see	 bone 	 s 	 	when	there	was	a	body	there	.
 some 	 thing 	 	was	going	on	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.	i	headed	to	new	york	to	a	studio	.
i	took	a	side	trip	to	the	american	museum	,	and	i	never	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	it	's	the	same	discipline	--	they	're	 kind 	 red 	 	 discipline 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	is	there	 any 	 thing 	 	that	is	not	 visual 	 izing 	 	what	ca	n't	be	 s 	 een 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 discover 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	dinosaur	bone	from	a	small	piece	of	it	that	's	out	there	,	or	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 distort 	 ion 	 	that	we	try	to	see	 a 	 s 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 distort 	 ion 	 	in	one	animal	to	 an 	 other 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	visual	.
i	give	you	a	human	face	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 expert 	 s 	 	at	that	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	us	 year 	 s 	 	to	understand	how	to	do	that	with	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 kind 	 red 	 	 discipline 	 s 	 	.
but	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	in	chicago	is	a	way	to	get	,	collect	together	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 student 	 s 	 	who	are	 l 	 east 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	in	our	science	and	technology	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
we	all	know	,	and	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 all 	 usion 	 s 	 	to	it	,	that	we	are	 fail 	 ing 	 	in	our	ability	to	produce	 en 	 ough 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	and	 technician 	 s 	 	.
we	've	known	that	for	a	long	time	.	we	've	gone	through	the	sputnik	phase	,	and	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	pace	of	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	even	more	prominent	.	where	are	all	these	people	going	to	come	from	?
and	a	more	general	question	for	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	,	what	's	going	to	happen	to	all	the	rest	that	are	left	 be 	 hind 	 	?
what	about	all	the	 kid 	 s 	 	like	me	that	 we 	 re 	 	in	school	--	 kid 	 s 	 	like	some	of	you	out	there	--	that	 we 	 re 	 	in	school	and	did	n't	get	a	chance	and	will	never	get	a	chance	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	science	and	technology	?
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 question 	 s 	 	i	ask	.	and	we	talk	about	ethiopia	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
niger	is	 equal 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	 desperate 	 ly 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	in	niger	.
they	have	an	 aid 	 s 	 	problem	.	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	--	the	u.s.	state	 depart 	 ment 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	government	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	what	do	you	want	to	do	?	and	they	 g 	 ave 	 	them	two	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 dinosaur 	 s 	 	was	one	of	them	.
give	us	a	museum	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	and	we	will	attract	 tourist 	 s 	 	,	which	is	our	number	two	industry	.
and	i	hope	to	god	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	government	,	me	,	or	ted	,	or	 some 	 body 	 	 help 	 s 	 	us	do	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	would	be	an	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	for	 the 	 ir 	 	country	.
but	when	we	look	back	at	our	own	country	,	we	're	looking	back	at	our	cities	,	the	cities	where	most	of	you	come	from	--	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	city	i	come	from	--	there	's	 leg 	 ions 	 	of	 kid 	 s 	 	out	there	like	these	.
and	the	question	is	--	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	address	 th 	 is 	 	question	for	centuries	--	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	we	get	these	 kid 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	science	.
we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	in	chicago	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	--	a	non	-	profit	 organ 	 ization 	 	--	 call 	 ed 	 	project	exploration	.
these	are	two	 kid 	 s 	 	from	project	exploration	.
we	met	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	early	 stage 	 s 	 	in	high	school	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	--	 fail 	 ing 	 	to	poor	 student 	 s 	 	,	and	they	are	now	--	one	at	the	university	of	chicago	,	 an 	 other 	 	in	illinois	.
we	've	got	 student 	 s 	 	at	harvard	.	we	're	six	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	track	record	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	go	out	there	 a 	 s 	 	a	scholar	,	and	you	try	to	find	out	 long 	 itudinal 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	track	 record 	 s 	 	like	that	,	there	 essential 	 ly 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	,	if	 non 	 e 	 	.
so	,	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	track	record	of	100	percent	 gradu 	 ation 	 	,	90	percent	going	to	college	,	 man 	 y 	 	first	-	generation	,	90	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 choos 	 ing 	 	science	 a 	 s 	 	a	 care 	 er 	 	.
it	's	an	 impress 	 ive 	 	track	record	,	and	so	we	look	back	and	we	say	,	well	,	we	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	work	 th 	 is 	 	out	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	from	the	start	,	but	when	we	look	back	,	there	are	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	in	science	education	.
it	's	gone	through	science	 a 	 s 	 	an	 inquir 	 y 	 	,	which	was	a	big	advance	,	and	dewey	back	at	chicago	--	you	learn	by	 do 	 ing 	 	.
to	--	you	learn	by	 envision 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	and	then	you	learn	to	envision	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	.
the	next	step	is	to	learn	the	 cap 	 ability 	 	to	make	 your 	 self 	 	a	scientist	.
you	have	to	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 step 	 s 	 	.	if	you	have	--	it	's	easy	to	get	 kid 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	science	.
it	's	hard	to	get	them	to	envision	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	which	 involve 	 s 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	in	front	of	people	like	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	here	at	 th 	 is 	 	 sym 	 po 	 s 	 ium 	 	and	 present 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 knowledge 	 able 	 	person	,	and	then	 see 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	role	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	and	giving	 your 	 self 	 	the	 tool 	 s 	 	to	pursue	that	.
and	so	,	that	's	what	we	're	going	to	do	.	we	're	 plan 	 ning 	 	a	permanent	home	in	chicago	.
we	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	i	guarantee	you	 th 	 is 	 	one	thing	--	and	i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	some	people	here	at	ted	--	it	's	not	going	to	look	like	 any 	 thing 	 	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
it	's	going	to	be	part	-	school	,	part	-	museum	hall	,	part	-	 conserv 	 atory 	 	,	part	-	zoo	,	and	part	of	an	answer	to	the	problem	of	how	you	interest	 kid 	 s 	 	in	science	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
