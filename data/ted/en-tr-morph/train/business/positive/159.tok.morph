i	am	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	be	 a 	 mid 	 st 	 	some	of	the	most	--	the	 light 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 disturb 	 ing 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	and	they	're	 reflect 	 ing 	 	on	my	 glass 	 es 	 	.
i	am	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	and	 honor 	 ed 	 	to	be	 a 	 mid 	 st 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	and	intelligent	people	.
i	have	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	the	three	previous	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	and	guess	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
every	single	thing	i	 plan 	 ned 	 	to	say	,	they	have	 s 	 aid 	 	it	here	,	and	it	 look 	 s 	 	and	 sound 	 s 	 	like	i	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	to	say	.
but	there	is	a	 say 	 ing 	 	in	my	culture	that	if	a	bud	 leav 	 es 	 	a	tree	 with 	 out 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	that	bud	is	a	young	one	.
so	,	i	will	--	since	i	am	not	young	and	am	 ver 	 y 	 	old	,	i	still	will	say	 some 	 thing 	 	.
we	are	 host 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 opport 	 un 	 e 	 	moment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	is	taking	place	in	berlin	.
it	is	the	g	8	 summ 	 it 	 	.
the	g	8	 summ 	 it 	 	 pro 	 pose 	 s 	 	that	the	solution	to	africa	's	 problem 	 s 	 	should	be	a	massive	 in 	 crease 	 	in	aid	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 kin 	 	to	the	marshall	plan	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	do	not	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	marshall	plan	.
one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	the	marshall	plan	have	 be 	 en 	 	 over 	 state 	 d 	 	.
 it 	 s 	 	largest	 recipient 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	germany	and	france	,	and	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	2.5	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	gdp	.
an	average	african	country	 receiv 	 es 	 	foreign	aid	to	the	tune	of	13	,	15	percent	of	 it 	 s 	 	gdp	,	and	that	is	an	unprecedented	transfer	of	financial	 resource 	 s 	 	from	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	to	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	i	want	to	say	that	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	we	need	to	connect	.
how	the	media	 cover 	 s 	 	africa	in	the	west	,	and	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	that	.
by	 dis 	 play 	 ing 	 	despair	,	 help 	 lessness 	 	and	 hope 	 lessness 	 	,	the	media	is	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	truth	about	africa	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	the	truth	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	media	is	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	the	whole	truth	.
 be 	 cause 	 	despair	,	civil	war	,	 hung 	 er 	 	and	famine	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	part	and	parcel	of	our	african	 re 	 ality 	 	,	they	are	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	they	are	the	 small 	 est 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
africa	 ha 	 s 	 	53	 nation 	 s 	 	.
we	have	civil	 war 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	six	 count 	 ries 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	media	are	 cover 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	six	 count 	 ries 	 	.
africa	 ha 	 s 	 	immense	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	never	 navig 	 ate 	 	through	the	web	of	despair	and	 help 	 lessness 	 	that	the	western	media	 large 	 ly 	 	 present 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	audience	.
but	the	effect	of	that	 present 	 ation 	 	is	,	it	 appeal 	 s 	 	to	 sympath 	 y 	 	.
it	 appeal 	 s 	 	to	 p 	 ity 	 	.	it	 appeal 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	the	western	view	of	africa	's	economic	dilemma	is	 frame 	 d 	 	 wrong 	 ly 	 	.
the	wrong	framing	is	a	product	of	 think 	 ing 	 	that	africa	is	a	place	of	despair	.
what	should	we	do	with	it	?	we	should	give	food	to	the	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
we	should	deliver	 medicine 	 s 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	ill	.
we	should	 s 	 end 	 	 peace 	 keep 	 ing 	 	 troop 	 s 	 	to	serve	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	facing	a	civil	war	.
and	in	the	process	,	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 strip 	 ped 	 	of	self	-	 initi 	 ative 	 	.
i	want	to	say	that	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	fundamental	 weak 	 ness 	 es 	 	.
but	 equal 	 ly 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	and	a	lot	of	potential	.
we	need	to	 re 	 frame 	 	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	is	facing	africa	,	from	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	despair	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	poverty	 r 	 eduction 	 	,	to	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	hope	.
we	frame	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	hope	,	and	that	is	worth	creation	.
the	 challeng 	 e 	 	facing	all	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	africa	is	not	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	 reduc 	 ing 	 	poverty	.
it	should	be	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	creating	wealth	.
once	we	change	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	--	if	you	say	the	africans	are	poor	and	they	need	poverty	 r 	 eduction 	 	,	you	have	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 cart 	 el 	 	of	good	 intent 	 ions 	 	moving	onto	the	continent	,	with	what	?
 medicine 	 s 	 	for	the	poor	,	food	relief	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 hung 	 ry 	 	,	and	 peace 	 keeper 	 s 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	facing	civil	war	.
and	in	the	process	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	are	productive	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	 treat 	 ing 	 	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	not	the	 cause 	 s 	 	of	africa	's	fundamental	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	to	school	and	giving	them	 medicine 	 s 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	not	create	wealth	for	them	.
wealth	is	a	function	of	income	,	and	income	 come 	 s 	 	from	you	 find 	 ing 	 	a	 profit 	 able 	 	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	or	a	well	-	 pay 	 ing 	 	job	.
now	,	once	we	begin	to	talk	about	wealth	creation	in	africa	,	our	second	 challeng 	 e 	 	will	be	,	who	are	the	wealth	-	creating	 agent 	 s 	 	in	any	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
they	are	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	told	us	they	are	 al 	 ways 	 	about	four	percent	of	the	population	,	but	16	percent	are	 imit 	 ators 	 	.
but	they	 al 	 so 	 	succeed	at	the	job	of	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	.
so	,	where	should	we	be	 put 	 ting 	 	the	money	?
we	need	to	put	money	where	it	can	 productive 	 ly 	 	grow	.
support	private	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	africa	,	both	domestic	and	foreign	.
support	research	 institution 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	knowledge	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	wealth	creation	.
but	what	is	the	 inter 	 national 	 	aid	community	 do 	 ing 	 	with	africa	 to 	 day 	 	?
they	are	 throw 	 ing 	 	large	 sum 	 s 	 	of	money	for	 prim 	 ary 	 	health	,	for	 prim 	 ary 	 	education	,	for	food	relief	.
the	entire	continent	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	place	of	despair	,	in	need	of	 char 	 ity 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	can	any	one	of	you	tell	me	a	neighbor	,	a	friend	,	a	 relat 	 ive 	 	that	you	know	,	who	 be 	 came 	 	rich	by	 receiv 	 ing 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	?
by	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	 beg 	 ging 	 	bowl	and	 receiv 	 ing 	 	alms	?
 do 	 es 	 	any	one	of	you	in	the	audience	have	that	person	?
 do 	 es 	 	any	one	of	you	know	a	country	that	 develop 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	and	 kind 	 ness 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	?
well	,	since	i	'm	not	 see 	 ing 	 	the	hand	,	it	 appear 	 s 	 	that	what	i	'm	 stat 	 ing 	 	is	true	.
andrew	mwenda	:	i	can	see	bono	 say 	 s 	 	he	 know 	 s 	 	the	country	.
which	country	is	that	?
am	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	but	let	me	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	.
external	 act 	 ors 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	present	to	you	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
the	ability	to	 util 	 ize 	 	that	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	advantage	 depend 	 s 	 	on	your	internal	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	them	we	have	n't	 benefit 	 ed 	 	much	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	we	lack	the	internal	,	 institution 	 al 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	and	policy	 frame 	 work 	 	that	can	make	it	possible	for	us	to	benefit	from	our	external	 relation 	 s 	 	.	i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
under	the	cotonou	 agree 	 ment 	 	,	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	lome	convention	,	african	 count 	 ries 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	by	europe	to	export	 good 	 s 	 	,	duty	-	free	,	to	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	market	.
my	own	country	,	uganda	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	quota	to	export	50,000	metric	 ton 	 s 	 	of	sugar	to	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	market	.
we	have	n't	 export 	 ed 	 	one	 kilo 	 gram 	 	yet	.
we	import	50,000	metric	 ton 	 s 	 	of	sugar	from	brazil	and	cuba	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	under	the	beef	 proto 	 col 	 	of	that	 agree 	 ment 	 	,	african	 count 	 ries 	 	that	produce	beef	have	 quota 	 s 	 	to	export	beef	duty	-	free	to	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	market	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	africa	's	most	 success 	 ful 	 	nation	,	botswana	,	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	met	 it 	 s 	 	quota	.
so	,	i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	the	fundamental	source	of	africa	's	 in 	 ability 	 	to	engage	the	rest	of	the	world	in	a	more	productive	relationship	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	poor	 institution 	 al 	 	and	policy	 frame 	 work 	 	.
and	all	 form 	 s 	 	of	intervention	need	support	,	the	evolution	of	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 institution 	 s 	 	that	create	wealth	,	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 institution 	 s 	 	that	 in 	 crease 	 	 product 	 ivity 	 	.
how	do	we	begin	to	do	that	,	and	why	is	aid	the	bad	instrument	?
aid	is	the	bad	instrument	,	and	do	you	know	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	all	 government 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	need	money	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
money	is	 need 	 ed 	 	for	a	simple	thing	like	 keep 	 ing 	 	law	and	order	.
you	have	to	pay	the	 arm 	 y 	 	and	the	police	to	show	law	and	order	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 government 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 dictator 	 ial 	 	,	they	need	 re 	 ally 	 	to	have	the	 arm 	 y 	 	clobber	the	 op 	 position 	 	.
the	second	thing	you	need	to	do	is	pay	your	 politic 	 al 	 	 hang 	 ers 	 	-	on	.
why	should	people	support	 the 	 ir 	 	government	?
well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 give 	 s 	 	them	good	,	 pay 	 ing 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	or	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	african	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 un 	 official 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	profit	from	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
the	fact	is	no	government	in	the	world	,	with	the	exception	of	a	few	,	like	that	of	idi	amin	,	can	seek	to	depend	 entire 	 ly 	 	on	force	 a 	 s 	 	an	instrument	of	rule	.
 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	they	need	 leg 	 i 	 timacy 	 	.
to	get	 leg 	 i 	 timacy 	 	,	 government 	 s 	 	often	need	to	deliver	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 prim 	 ary 	 	education	,	 prim 	 ary 	 	health	,	 road 	 s 	 	,	build	 hospital 	 s 	 	and	 clinic 	 s 	 	.
if	the	government	's	 fisc 	 al 	 	 surviv 	 al 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	it	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	raise	money	from	 it 	 s 	 	own	people	,	 s 	 uch 	 	a	government	is	driven	by	self	-	interest	to	govern	in	a	more	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	fashion	.
it	will	 s 	 it 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	who	create	wealth	.
talk	to	them	about	the	kind	of	 poli 	 cies 	 	and	 institution 	 s 	 	that	are	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	them	to	expand	a	scale	and	scope	of	business	so	that	it	can	collect	more	tax	 revenue 	 s 	 	from	them	.
the	problem	with	the	african	continent	and	the	problem	with	the	aid	industry	is	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 distort 	 ed 	 	the	structure	of	 incentive 	 s 	 	facing	the	 government 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
the	productive	margin	in	our	 government 	 s 	 	'	search	for	revenue	 do 	 es 	 	not	lie	in	the	domestic	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	it	lies	with	 inter 	 national 	 	 donor 	 s 	 	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 s 	 it 	 	with	ugandan	--	--	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 s 	 it 	 	with	ugandan	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	ghanaian	 business 	 men 	 	,	south	african	 enter 	 pri 	 s 	 ing 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	our	 government 	 s 	 	find	it	more	productive	to	talk	to	the	imf	and	the	world	bank	.
i	can	tell	you	,	even	if	you	have	ten	ph	.	ds	.	,	you	can	never	beat	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	computer	industry	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	the	knowledge	that	is	 requir 	 ed 	 	for	you	to	understand	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	expand	a	business	--	it	 requir 	 es 	 	that	you	listen	to	the	people	,	the	private	sector	 act 	 ors 	 	in	that	industry	.
 government 	 s 	 	in	africa	have	 there 	 fore 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	by	the	 inter 	 national 	 	community	,	to	avoid	building	productive	 arrange 	 ments 	 	with	your	own	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	begin	 end 	 less 	 	 negoti 	 ations 	 	with	the	imf	and	the	world	bank	,	and	then	it	is	the	imf	and	the	world	bank	that	tell	them	what	 it 	 s 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	need	.
in	the	process	,	we	,	the	african	people	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	 side 	 lined 	 	from	the	policy	-	making	,	policy	-	 orient 	 ation 	 	,	and	policy	-	 implement 	 ation 	 	process	in	our	 count 	 ries 	 	.
we	have	 limit 	 ed 	 	 in 	 put 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	who	 pay 	 s 	 	the	 pipe 	 r 	 	 call 	 s 	 	the	tune	.
the	imf	,	the	world	bank	,	and	the	 cart 	 el 	 	of	good	 intent 	 ions 	 	in	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	over	our	 right 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	what	our	 government 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	depend	on	aid	,	is	to	listen	to	 inter 	 national 	 	 credit 	 ors 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
but	i	want	to	put	a	 cave 	 at 	 	on	my	argument	,	and	that	 cave 	 at 	 	is	that	it	is	not	true	that	aid	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 destruct 	 ive 	 	.
some	aid	may	have	built	a	hospital	,	fed	a	 hung 	 ry 	 	village	.
it	may	have	built	a	road	,	and	that	road	may	have	 serv 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	role	.
the	 mistak 	 e 	 	of	the	 inter 	 national 	 	aid	industry	is	to	pick	these	 isolate 	 d 	 	 incident 	 s 	 	of	success	,	 general 	 ize 	 	them	,	pour	 billion 	 s 	 	and	 trillion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	them	,	and	then	spread	them	 a 	 cross 	 	the	whole	world	,	 ignor 	 ing 	 	the	specific	and	 un 	 ique 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	in	a	 give 	 n 	 	village	,	the	 skill 	 s 	 	,	the	 practice 	 s 	 	,	the	 norm 	 s 	 	and	 habit 	 s 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	that	small	aid	project	to	succeed	--	like	in	sauri	village	,	in	kenya	,	where	jeffrey	sachs	is	 work 	 ing 	 	--	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 general 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	experience	 a 	 s 	 	the	experience	of	 every 	 body 	 	.
aid	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	the	 resource 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 government 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 make 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	a	government	the	most	 profit 	 able 	 	thing	you	can	have	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	person	in	africa	seeking	a	 care 	 er 	 	.
by	increasing	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 ness 	 	of	the	state	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	our	 ethnic 	 ally 	 	 fragment 	 ed 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	in	africa	,	aid	 tend 	 s 	 	to	 accent 	 uate 	 	ethnic	 tension 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	every	single	ethnic	group	now	 begin 	 s 	 	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	enter	the	state	in	order	to	get	access	to	the	foreign	aid	pie	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	the	most	 enter 	 pri 	 s 	 ing 	 	people	in	africa	can	not	find	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	trade	and	to	work	in	the	private	sector	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 institution 	 al 	 	and	policy	environment	is	 hostil 	 e 	 	to	business	.
 government 	 s 	 	are	not	changing	it	.	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	need	to	talk	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
they	talk	to	 inter 	 national 	 	 donor 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	most	 enter 	 pri 	 s 	 ing 	 	africans	end	up	going	to	work	for	government	,	and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 tension 	 s 	 	in	our	 count 	 ries 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	depend	on	aid	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	say	that	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	to	note	that	,	over	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 receiv 	 ing 	 	increasing	aid	from	the	 inter 	 national 	 	community	,	in	the	form	of	technical	 assist 	 ance 	 	,	and	financial	aid	,	and	all	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	aid	.
between	1960	and	2003	,	our	continent	 receiv 	 ed 	 	600	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	aid	,	and	we	are	still	told	that	there	is	a	lot	of	poverty	in	africa	.
where	 ha 	 s 	 	all	the	aid	gone	?
i	want	to	use	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	my	own	country	,	 call 	 ed 	 	uganda	,	and	the	kind	of	structure	of	 incentive 	 s 	 	that	aid	 ha 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	there	.
in	the	2006-2007	budget	,	 expect 	 ed 	 	revenue	:	2.5	trillion	 s 	 hill 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
the	 expect 	 ed 	 	foreign	aid	:	1.9	trillion	.

you	need	wembley	 stad 	 ium 	 	to	host	our	parliament	.
one	hundred	thirty	-	four	 commission 	 s 	 	and	semi	-	autonomous	government	bodies	,	all	of	which	have	 director 	 s 	 	and	the	 car 	 s 	 	.	and	the	final	thing	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 address 	 ed 	 	to	mr.	bono	.	in	his	work	,	he	may	help	us	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
a	 re 	 cent 	 	government	of	uganda	 stud 	 y 	 	found	that	there	are	3,000	four	-	wheel	drive	motor	 vehicle 	 s 	 	at	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	health	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
uganda	 ha 	 s 	 	961	sub	-	 count 	 ies 	 	,	each	of	them	with	a	 dispens 	 ary 	 	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	which	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 ambul 	 ance 	 	.

 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	say	that	before	i	came	to	speak	here	,	i	was	told	that	the	principle	of	tedglobal	is	that	the	good	speech	should	be	like	a	 mini 	 skirt 	 	.
it	should	be	short	 en 	 ough 	 	to	arouse	interest	,	but	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	cover	the	subject	.
i	hope	i	have	 achiev 	 ed 	 	that	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
