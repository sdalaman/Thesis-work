so	the	first	question	is	,	why	do	we	need	to	even	worry	about	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	threat	?
what	is	it	that	we	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	?
when	i	say	``	we	,	``	i	'm	at	the	council	on	foreign	 relation 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	in	the	national	security	community	,	and	of	course	in	the	biology	community	and	the	public	health	community	.
while	 global 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	travel	,	it	's	made	it	 necess 	 ary 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	be	 every 	 where 	 	,	all	the	time	,	all	over	the	world	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	your	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 hitch 	 hik 	 ers 	 	are	moving	with	you	.
so	a	plague	 out 	 break 	 	in	surat	,	india	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	not	an	 obscur 	 e 	 	event	,	but	a	 global 	 ized 	 	event	--	a	 global 	 ized 	 	concern	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	risk	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
katrina	 show 	 ed 	 	us	that	we	can	not	 complete 	 ly 	 	depend	on	government	to	have	 read 	 iness 	 	in	hand	,	to	be	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 hand 	 ling 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	an	 out 	 break 	 	would	be	 multi 	 ple 	 	katrinas	at	once	.
our	big	concern	at	the	moment	is	a	virus	 call 	 ed 	 	h	5n1	flu	--	some	of	you	call	it	bird	flu	--	which	first	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	southern	 chin 	 a 	 	,	in	the	mid	-	1990s	,	but	we	did	n't	know	about	it	 un 	 til 	 	1997	.
at	the	end	of	last	christmas	 on 	 ly 	 	13	 count 	 ries 	 	had	 s 	 een 	 	h	5n1	.
but	we	're	now	up	to	55	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	,	have	had	 th 	 is 	 	virus	emerge	,	in	either	 bird 	 s 	 	,	or	people	or	both	.
in	the	bird	 out 	 break 	 s 	 	we	now	can	see	that	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	whole	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	virus	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	americas	.
and	i	'll	get	 in 	 to 	 	why	we	've	so	far	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 par 	 ed 	 	in	a	moment	.
in	domestic	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 chicken 	 s 	 	,	it	's	100	percent	lethal	.
it	's	one	of	the	most	lethal	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	 circul 	 ation 	 	in	the	world	in	any	 re 	 cent 	 	centuries	.
and	we	've	 deal 	 t 	 	with	it	by	 kill 	 ing 	 	off	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 chicken 	 s 	 	,	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	often	not	 reimburs 	 ing 	 	the	peasant	 farm 	 ers 	 	with	the	result	that	there	's	cover	-	up	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	carried	on	 migr 	 ation 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	wild	 migr 	 atory 	 	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	.
there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 central 	 ized 	 	event	in	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	lake	chenghai	,	 chin 	 a 	 	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	the	 migr 	 ating 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	had	a	 multi 	 ple 	 	event	where	 thousand 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	mutation	 occur 	 ring 	 	in	the	virus	,	which	made	the	species	range	 broad 	 en 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	.
so	that	 bird 	 s 	 	going	to	siberia	,	to	europe	,	and	to	africa	carried	the	virus	,	which	had	not	 previous 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	possible	.
we	're	now	 see 	 ing 	 	 out 	 break 	 s 	 	in	human	 population 	 s 	 	--	so	far	,	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	small	 event 	 s 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	 out 	 break 	 s 	 	,	 occasion 	 al 	 	 cluster 	 s 	 	.
the	virus	 ha 	 s 	 	 mut 	 ated 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	in	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	to	form	two	distinct	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	if	you	will	,	of	the	h	5n1	viral	tree	with	 branch 	 es 	 	in	them	,	and	with	different	 attribut 	 es 	 	that	are	 worry 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	's	 concern 	 ing 	 	us	?	well	,	first	of	all	,	at	no	time	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	have	we	 succeed 	 ed 	 	in	making	in	a	 time 	 ly 	 	fashion	,	a	specific	 vaccin 	 e 	 	for	more	than	260	million	people	.
it	's	not	going	to	do	us	 ver 	 y 	 	much	good	in	a	global	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
you	've	heard	about	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	we	're	 stock 	 pil 	 ing 	 	.
but	 no 	 body 	 	 believ 	 es 	 	it	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	effective	if	we	have	a	real	 out 	 break 	 	.
after	9/11	,	when	the	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	closed	,	our	flu	season	was	 delay 	 ed 	 	by	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
so	the	thought	is	,	 he 	 y 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	what	we	should	do	is	just	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	--	we	hear	there	is	h	5n1	 spread 	 ing 	 	from	human	to	human	,	the	virus	 ha 	 s 	 	 mut 	 ated 	 	to	be	a	human	-	to	-	human	 transmit 	 ter 	 	--	let	's	shut	down	the	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	huge	 super 	 computer 	 	analyses	,	 d 	 one 	 	of	the	 like 	 ly 	 	 effective 	 ness 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	show	that	it	wo	n't	buy	us	much	time	at	all	.
and	of	course	it	will	be	 huge 	 ly 	 	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	in	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	all	 mask 	 s 	 	are	made	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
how	do	you	get	them	 mobilize 	 d 	 	around	the	world	if	you	've	shut	all	the	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	down	?
how	do	you	get	the	 vaccin 	 es 	 	 move 	 d 	 	around	the	world	and	the	 drug 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	,	and	 what 	 ever 	 	may	or	not	be	 avail 	 able 	 	that	would	work	.
so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 shut 	 ting 	 	down	the	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	is	 counter 	 productive 	 	.
we	're	 worri 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	virus	,	 un 	 like 	 	any	other	flu	we	've	ever	 stud 	 ied 	 	,	can	be	 transmit 	 ted 	 	by	eating	raw	meat	of	the	 infect 	 ed 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	to	wild	 cat 	 s 	 	and	domestic	 cat 	 s 	 	,	and	now	 al 	 so 	 	domestic	pet	 dog 	 s 	 	.
and	in	 experiment 	 al 	 	 feed 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	 rod 	 ent 	 s 	 	and	 ferret 	 s 	 	,	we	found	that	the	 animal 	 s 	 	exhibit	 symptom 	 s 	 	never	 s 	 een 	 	with	flu	:	 seizure 	 s 	 	,	central	nervous	system	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	,	partial	 para 	 lysis 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	your	normal	garden	-	 varie 	 ty 	 	flu	.
it	 mimic 	 s 	 	what	we	now	understand	about	 re 	 construct 	 ing 	 	the	1918	flu	virus	,	the	last	great	 pan 	 demic 	 	,	in	that	it	 al 	 so 	 	 jump 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	from	 bird 	 s 	 	to	people	.
we	had	evolution	over	time	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rate	in	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	:	55	percent	of	people	who	have	 be 	 come 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	h	5n1	have	,	in	fact	,	 succumb 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	do	n't	have	a	huge	number	of	people	who	got	 infect 	 ed 	 	and	never	 develop 	 ed 	 	disease	.
in	 experiment 	 al 	 	 feed 	 ing 	 	in	 monkey 	 s 	 	you	can	see	that	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 down 	 regulat 	 es 	 	a	specific	 immun 	 e 	 	system	 modul 	 ator 	 	.
the	result	is	that	what	 kill 	 s 	 	you	is	not	the	virus	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	but	your	own	 immun 	 e 	 	system	 over 	 react 	 ing 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 what 	 ever 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	foreign	i	'm	going	 ber 	 s 	 er 	 k 	 	.	``
the	result	:	most	of	the	 death 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	people	under	30	 year 	 s 	 	of	age	,	 ro 	 bust 	 ly 	 	 health 	 y 	 	young	 adult 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 s 	 een 	 	human	-	to	-	human	 trans 	 mission 	 	in	at	 l 	 east 	 	three	 cluster 	 s 	 	--	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 intima 	 te 	 	contact	,	still	not	 put 	 ting 	 	the	world	at	large	at	any	kind	of	risk	.
 al 	 right 	 	,	so	i	've	got	you	nervous	.
now	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 assum 	 e 	 	,	well	the	 government 	 s 	 	are	going	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	we	have	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	money	.
most	of	the	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	in	the	bush	 administr 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	more	related	to	the	 an 	 thra 	 x 	 	 result 	 s 	 	and	bio	-	 terror 	 ism 	 	threat	.
but	a	lot	of	money	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	out	at	the	local	level	and	at	the	federal	level	to	look	at	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	.
end	result	:	 on 	 ly 	 	15	 state 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 cert 	 ified 	 	to	be	able	to	do	mass	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	 vaccin 	 e 	 	and	 drug 	 s 	 	in	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
half	the	 state 	 s 	 	would	run	out	of	hospital	 bed 	 s 	 	in	the	first	week	,	 may 	 be 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
and	40	 state 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	have	an	 a 	 cute 	 	 nurs 	 ing 	 	 short 	 age 	 	.
add	on	 pan 	 demic 	 	threat	,	you	're	in	big	trouble	.
so	what	have	people	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	money	?
 exercis 	 es 	 	,	 drill 	 s 	 	,	all	over	the	world	.
let	's	pretend	there	's	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
let	's	 every 	 body 	 	run	around	and	play	your	role	.
main	result	is	that	there	is	tremendous	 con 	 fusion 	 	.
most	of	these	people	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	what	 the 	 ir 	 	job	will	be	.
and	the	bottom	line	,	major	thing	that	 ha 	 s 	 	come	through	in	every	single	drill	:	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	who	's	in	charge	.
 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	the	chain	of	command	.
if	it	 we 	 re 	 	los	angeles	,	is	it	the	mayor	,	the	 govern 	 or 	 	,	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	the	head	of	 home 	 land 	 	security	?
in	fact	,	the	federal	government	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	the	principle	federal	officer	,	who	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	with	tsa	.
the	government	 say 	 s 	 	the	federal	 respons 	 ibility 	 	will	 bas 	 ically 	 	be	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	keep	the	virus	out	,	which	we	all	know	is	 im 	 possible 	 	,	and	then	to	 mitig 	 ate 	 	the	impact	 prim 	 arily 	 	on	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
the	rest	is	up	to	your	local	community	.
 every 	 thing 	 	is	about	your	town	,	where	you	live	.
well	how	good	a	city	council	you	have	,	how	good	a	mayor	you	have	--	that	's	who	's	going	to	be	in	charge	.
most	local	 facil 	 ities 	 	would	all	be	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	to	try	and	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	piece	of	the	federal	 stock 	 pile 	 	of	a	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	tamiflu	,	which	may	or	may	not	be	 help 	 ful 	 	--	i	'll	get	 in 	 to 	 	that	--	of	 avail 	 able 	 	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	and	any	other	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	and	 mask 	 s 	 	,	and	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 stock 	 pil 	 ed 	 	.
and	you	'll	have	massive	 com 	 petition 	 	.
now	we	did	purchase	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	all	heard	about	it	,	made	by	sanofi	-	aventis	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	it	's	made	against	the	current	form	of	h	5n1	.
we	know	the	virus	will	 mut 	 ate 	 	.	it	will	be	a	different	virus	.
the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	 use 	 less 	 	.
so	here	's	where	the	 decision 	 s 	 	come	in	.
you	're	the	mayor	of	your	local	town	.
let	's	see	,	should	we	order	that	all	 pet 	 s 	 	be	 ke 	 pt 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	?
germany	did	that	when	h	5n1	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	germany	last	year	,	in	order	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	the	spread	between	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	by	 house 	 hold 	 	 cat 	 s 	 	,	 dog 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
what	do	we	do	when	we	do	n't	have	any	 contain 	 ment 	 	rooms	with	reverse	air	that	will	allow	the	 health 	 care 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	to	take	care	of	 patient 	 s 	 	?
these	are	in	hong	kong	;	we	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	that	here	.
what	about	 quar 	 ant 	 ine 	 	?
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	sars	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	beijing	 quar 	 ant 	 ine 	 	did	seem	to	help	.
we	have	no	uniform	 poli 	 cies 	 	 regard 	 ing 	 	 quar 	 ant 	 ine 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	some	 state 	 s 	 	have	 different 	 ial 	 	 poli 	 cies 	 	,	 count 	 y 	 	by	 count 	 y 	 	.
but	what	about	the	no	-	 brain 	 er 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	?	should	we	close	all	the	 school 	 s 	 	?
well	then	what	about	all	the	 work 	 ers 	 	?	they	wo	n't	go	to	work	if	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	n't	in	school	.
 encourag 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 com 	 mut 	 ing 	 	?	what	 work 	 s 	 	?
well	the	british	government	did	a	model	of	 tele 	 com 	 mut 	 ing 	 	.
six	 week 	 s 	 	they	had	all	people	in	the	 bank 	 ing 	 	industry	pretend	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	was	 under 	 way 	 	.
what	they	found	was	,	the	core	 function 	 s 	 	--	you	know	you	still	sort	of	had	 bank 	 s 	 	,	but	you	could	n't	get	people	to	put	money	in	the	atm	 machine 	 s 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	was	 process 	 ing 	 	the	credit	 card 	 s 	 	.
your	 insur 	 ance 	 	 payment 	 s 	 	did	n't	go	through	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	would	be	in	a	disaster	state	of	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	just	 off 	 ice 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	,	 bank 	 ers 	 	.
we	do	n't	know	how	 import 	 ant 	 	hand	 wash 	 ing 	 	is	for	flu	--	 shock 	 ing 	 	.	one	 assum 	 es 	 	it	's	a	good	idea	to	wash	your	 hand 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	scientific	community	there	is	great	debate	about	what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	flu	 trans 	 mission 	 	between	people	is	from	 sneez 	 ing 	 	and	 cough 	 ing 	 	and	what	 percent 	 age 	 	is	on	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
the	institute	of	medicine	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	the	 mask 	 ing 	 	question	.
can	we	figure	out	a	way	,	since	we	know	we	wo	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 mask 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	make	them	in	america	 any 	 more 	 	,	they	're	all	made	in	 chin 	 a 	 	--	do	we	need	n	95	?	a	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	,	top	-	of	-	the	-	line	,	must	-	be	-	fitted	-	to	-	your	-	face	mask	?
or	can	we	get	away	with	some	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 mask 	 s 	 	?
in	the	sars	 epi 	 demic 	 	,	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	hong	kong	that	most	of	 trans 	 mission 	 	was	 be 	 cause 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 moving 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mask 	 s 	 	 im 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	got	 contami 	 nated 	 	with	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	mask	,	and	then	they	 rub 	 bed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	nose	.	 bing 	 o 	 	!	they	got	sars	.
it	was	n't	 fly 	 ing 	 	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	.
if	you	go	 on 	 line 	 	right	now	,	you	'll	get	so	much	phony	-	baloney	information	.
you	'll	end	up	 buy 	 ing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	an	n	95	mask	.	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
we	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	standard	for	what	should	be	the	 protect 	 ive 	 	gear	for	the	first	 respond 	 ers 	 	,	the	people	who	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	there	on	the	front	lines	.
and	tamiflu	.	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	of	 th 	 is 	 	drug	,	made	by	hoffmann	-	la	roche	,	 patent 	 ed 	 	drug	.
there	is	some	 indic 	 ation 	 	that	it	may	buy	you	some	time	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	an	 out 	 break 	 	.
should	you	take	tamiflu	for	a	long	period	of	time	,	well	,	one	of	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	is	 sui 	 cidal 	 	 ide 	 ations 	 	.
a	public	health	survey	 analyz 	 ed 	 	the	effect	that	large	-	scale	tamiflu	use	would	have	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 show 	 s 	 	it	 counter 	 active 	 	to	public	health	 measure 	 s 	 	,	making	 matter 	 s 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
and	here	is	the	other	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	:	when	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	 ing 	 est 	 s 	 	tamiflu	,	 on 	 ly 	 	20	percent	is	 metabol 	 ized 	 	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	to	be	an	active	 com 	 pound 	 	in	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
the	rest	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 s 	 table 	 	 com 	 pound 	 	,	which	 surviv 	 es 	 	filtration	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	 system 	 s 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	 ex 	 posing 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	that	would	carry	flu	and	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	them	a	chance	to	breed	resistant	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	.
and	we	now	have	 s 	 een 	 	tamiflu	-	resistant	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	in	both	vietnam	in	person	-	to	-	person	 trans 	 mission 	 	,	and	in	egypt	in	person	-	to	-	person	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
so	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	think	that	our	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	for	tamiflu	 a 	 s 	 	an	effective	drug	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
 never 	 the 	 less 	 	most	of	the	 government 	 s 	 	have	based	 the 	 ir 	 	whole	flu	 poli 	 cies 	 	on	building	 stock 	 pile 	 s 	 	of	tamiflu	.
russia	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stock 	 pil 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	for	95	percent	of	all	russians	.
we	've	 stock 	 pil 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	for	30	percent	.
when	i	say	 en 	 ough 	 	,	that	's	two	 week 	 s 	 	worth	.
and	then	you	're	on	your	own	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 pan 	 demic 	 	is	going	to	last	for	18	to	24	 month 	 s 	 	.
some	of	the	 poor 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	that	have	had	the	most	experience	with	h	5n1	have	built	up	 stock 	 pile 	 s 	 	;	they	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 expir 	 ed 	 	.	they	are	 al 	 ready 	 	out	of	date	.
what	do	we	know	from	1918	,	the	last	great	 pan 	 demic 	 	?
the	federal	government	 abdic 	 ated 	 	most	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
and	so	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	wild	 patch 	 work 	 	of	 regulat 	 ions 	 	all	over	america	.
every	city	,	 count 	 y 	 	,	state	did	 the 	 ir 	 	own	thing	.
and	the	 rule 	 s 	 	and	the	belief	 system 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 wild 	 ly 	 	disparate	.
in	some	 case 	 s 	 	all	 school 	 s 	 	,	all	 church 	 es 	 	,	all	public	 venue 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	closed	.
the	 pan 	 demic 	 	 circul 	 ated 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	in	18	 month 	 s 	 	in	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	commercial	air	travel	.
the	second	wave	was	the	 mut 	 ated 	 	,	super	-	killer	wave	.
and	in	the	first	wave	we	had	 en 	 ough 	 	 health 	 care 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	.
but	by	the	time	the	second	wave	hit	it	took	 s 	 uch 	 	a	toll	among	the	 health 	 care 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	that	we	lost	most	of	our	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	front	lines	.
 over 	 all 	 	we	lost	700,000	people	.
the	virus	was	100	percent	lethal	to	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	and	we	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	why	.
most	of	the	death	toll	was	15	to	40	year	-	olds	--	 ro 	 bust 	 ly 	 	 health 	 y 	 	young	 adult 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 like 	 ned 	 	to	the	plague	.
we	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	 di 	 ed 	 	.
the	low	-	ball	estimate	is	35	million	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	based	on	european	and	north	american	data	.
a	new	 stud 	 y 	 	by	chris	murray	at	harvard	 show 	 s 	 	that	if	you	look	at	the	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	by	the	brits	in	india	,	there	was	a	31	-	fold	 great 	 er 	 	death	rate	among	the	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	.
so	there	is	a	strong	belief	that	in	 place 	 s 	 	of	poverty	the	death	toll	was	far	 high 	 er 	 	.
and	that	a	more	 like 	 ly 	 	toll	is	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	of	80	to	100	million	people	before	we	had	commercial	air	travel	.
so	are	we	ready	?
 a 	 s 	 	a	nation	,	no	we	're	not	.
and	i	think	even	 t 	 hose 	 	in	the	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	would	say	that	is	the	case	,	that	we	still	have	a	long	ways	to	go	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	for	you	?	well	the	first	thing	is	,	i	would	n't	start	building	up	personal	 stock 	 pile 	 s 	 	of	 any 	 thing 	 	--	for	 your 	 self 	 	,	your	family	,	or	your	 employ 	 ees 	 	--	 un 	 less 	 	you	've	 re 	 ally 	 	 d 	 one 	 	your	 home 	 work 	 	.
what	mask	 work 	 s 	 	,	what	mask	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 mask 	 s 	 	do	you	need	?
the	institute	of	medicine	 stud 	 y 	 	felt	that	you	could	not	 re 	 cycle 	 	 mask 	 s 	 	.
well	if	you	think	it	's	going	to	last	18	 month 	 s 	 	,	are	you	going	to	buy	18	 month 	 s 	 	worth	of	 mask 	 s 	 	for	every	single	person	in	your	family	?
we	do	n't	know	--	 aga 	 in 	 	with	tamiflu	,	the	number	one	side	effect	of	tamiflu	is	flu	-	like	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
so	then	how	can	you	tell	who	in	your	family	 ha 	 s 	 	the	flu	if	 every 	 body 	 	is	taking	tamiflu	?
if	you	expand	that	out	to	think	of	a	whole	community	,	or	all	your	 employ 	 ees 	 	in	your	company	,	you	begin	to	 real 	 ize 	 	how	 limit 	 ed 	 	the	tamiflu	option	might	be	.
 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	up	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	i	'll	 stock 	 pile 	 	water	or	,	i	'll	 stock 	 pile 	 	food	,	or	what	have	you	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	?	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	place	to	 stock 	 pile 	 	18	 month 	 s 	 	worth	of	food	?	twenty	-	four	 month 	 s 	 	worth	of	food	?
do	you	want	to	view	the	 pan 	 demic 	 	threat	the	way	back	in	the	1950s	people	 view 	 ed 	 	the	civil	defense	issue	,	and	build	your	own	little	bomb	shelter	for	 pan 	 demic 	 	flu	?
i	do	n't	think	that	's	rational	.
i	think	it	's	about	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	be	prepared	 a 	 s 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 ing 	 	prepared	 a 	 s 	 	nation	,	 be 	 ing 	 	prepared	 a 	 s 	 	state	,	 be 	 ing 	 	prepared	 a 	 s 	 	town	.
and	right	now	most	of	the	 prepared 	 ness 	 	is	 deep 	 ly 	 	 flaw 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	hope	i	've	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	you	of	that	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	real	job	is	go	out	and	say	to	your	local	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	and	your	national	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	``	why	have	n't	you	 solve 	 d 	 	these	 problem 	 s 	 	?
why	are	you	still	 think 	 ing 	 	that	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	of	katrina	do	not	 app 	 ly 	 	to	flu	?	``
and	put	the	pressure	where	the	pressure	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	put	.
but	i	guess	the	other	thing	to	add	is	,	if	you	do	have	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	and	you	do	have	a	company	,	i	think	you	have	certain	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	that	you	are	 think 	 ing 	 	 a 	 head 	 	for	them	,	and	you	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	plan	.
at	a	 minim 	 um 	 	the	british	 bank 	 ing 	 	plan	 show 	 ed 	 	that	 tele 	 com 	 mut 	 ing 	 	can	be	 help 	 ful 	 	.
it	 prob 	 ably 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	are	not	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 	and	 cough 	 ing 	 	on	each	other	,	or	 touch 	 ing 	 	common	 object 	 s 	 	and	sharing	 thing 	 s 	 	via	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
but	can	you	sustain	your	company	that	way	?
well	if	you	have	a	dot	-	com	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	.
 other 	 wise 	 	you	're	in	trouble	.
happy	to	take	your	 question 	 s 	 	.
audience	member	:	what	 factor 	 s 	 	determine	the	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	?
laurie	 gar 	 ret 	 	:	what	 factor 	 s 	 	determine	the	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	.
i	could	give	you	a	bunch	of	flip	,	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	,	and	the	other	.
but	i	would	say	that	 honest 	 ly 	 	we	do	n't	know	.
 clear 	 ly 	 	the	bottom	line	is	the	virus	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 attenu 	 ates 	 	,	and	 cease 	 s 	 	to	be	a	lethal	virus	to	 human 	 ity 	 	,	and	 find 	 s 	 	other	 host 	 s 	 	.
but	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	how	and	why	that	 happen 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 eco 	 logy 	 	.
audience	member	:	what	kind	of	 trigger 	 s 	 	are	you	looking	for	?
you	know	way	more	than	any	of	us	.
to	say	ahh	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	then	we	are	going	to	have	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	?
lg	:	the	moment	that	you	see	any	evidence	of	serious	human	-	to	-	human	to	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
not	just	 intima 	 te 	 ly 	 	between	family	 member 	 s 	 	who	took	care	of	an	ailing	sister	or	brother	,	but	a	community	 infect 	 ed 	 	--	spread	 with 	 in 	 	a	school	,	spread	 with 	 in 	 	a	 dorm 	 itor 	 y 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	of	that	nature	.
then	i	think	that	there	is	universal	 agree 	 ment 	 	now	,	at	who	all	the	way	down	:	 s 	 end 	 	out	the	alert	.
audience	member	:	some	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ated 	 	that	 stat 	 in 	 s 	 	can	be	 help 	 ful 	 	.
can	you	talk	about	that	?
lg	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	there	is	some	evidence	that	taking	lipitor	and	other	common	 stat 	 in 	 s 	 	for	cholesterol	control	may	 de 	 crease 	 	your	 vulner 	 ability 	 	to	influenza	.
but	we	do	not	 complete 	 ly 	 	understand	why	.
the	 mechan 	 ism 	 	is	n't	clear	.
and	i	do	n't	know	that	there	is	any	way	 respons 	 ibly 	 	for	 some 	 one 	 	to	start	 medic 	 ating 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	with	 the 	 ir 	 	personal	supply	of	lipitor	or	 some 	 thing 	 	of	that	nature	.
we	have	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	idea	what	that	would	do	.
you	might	be	 caus 	 ing 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	in	your	children	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	.
audience	member	:	how	far	 a 	 long 	 	are	we	in	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	determine	 whet 	 her 	 	 some 	 one 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	are	full	-	blown	?
lg	:	right	.	so	i	have	for	a	long	time	 s 	 aid 	 	that	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	was	a	rapid	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	.
and	our	 center 	 s 	 	for	disease	control	 ha 	 s 	 	 label 	 ed 	 	a	test	they	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	rapid	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	 dip 	 stick 	 	.
you	could	do	it	to	your	own	kid	.	it	 change 	 s 	 	color	.
it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	if	you	have	h	5n1	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	where	we	are	in	science	with	dna	 ident 	 ification 	 	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	and	so	on	,	it	's	not	that	far	off	.
but	we	're	not	there	.	and	there	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	the	kind	of	 invest 	 ment 	 	to	get	us	there	.
audience	member	:	in	the	1918	flu	i	understand	that	they	 theor 	 ized 	 	that	there	was	some	 attenu 	 ation 	 	of	the	virus	when	it	made	the	leap	 in 	 to 	 	 human 	 s 	 	.
is	that	 like 	 ly 	 	,	do	you	think	,	here	?
i	mean	100	percent	death	rate	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	severe	.
lg	:	um	 yea 	 h 	 	.	so	we	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	what	the	 lethal 	 ity 	 	was	of	the	1918	 s 	 train 	 	to	wild	 bird 	 s 	 	before	it	 jump 	 ed 	 	from	 bird 	 s 	 	to	 human 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 cur 	 ious 	 	that	there	is	no	evidence	of	mass	die	-	offs	of	 chicken 	 s 	 	or	 house 	 hold 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	america	before	the	human	 pan 	 demic 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
that	may	be	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 event 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	on	the	other	side	of	the	world	where	 no 	 body 	 	was	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	.
but	the	virus	 clear 	 ly 	 	went	through	one	round	around	the	world	in	a	mild	 en 	 ough 	 	form	that	the	british	 arm 	 y 	 	in	world	war	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cert 	 ified 	 	that	it	was	not	a	threat	and	would	not	affect	the	 out 	 come 	 	of	the	war	.
and	after	 circul 	 ating 	 	around	the	world	came	back	in	a	form	that	was	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	lethal	.
what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 infect 	 ed 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	it	?
 aga 	 in 	 	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.
it	's	clear	that	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 mal 	 nourish 	 ed 	 	to	begin	with	,	you	had	a	 weak 	 ened 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	system	,	you	lived	in	poverty	in	india	or	africa	,	your	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	of	 dy 	 ing 	 	was	far	 great 	 er 	 	.
but	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	.
audience	member	:	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	heard	is	that	the	real	death	cause	when	you	get	a	flu	is	the	 associate 	 d 	 	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	,	and	that	a	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	may	 off 	 er 	 	you	50	percent	better	chance	of	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
lg	:	for	a	long	time	,	 research 	 ers 	 	in	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 dismiss 	 ive 	 	of	the	 pan 	 demic 	 	flu	threat	on	the	 ground 	 s 	 	that	back	in	1918	they	did	n't	have	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.
and	that	most	people	who	die	of	regular	flu	--	which	in	regular	flu	 year 	 s 	 	is	about	360,000	people	 world 	 wide 	 	,	most	of	them	senior	 citizen 	 s 	 	--	and	they	die	not	of	the	flu	but	 be 	 cause 	 	the	flu	 give 	 s 	 	an	assault	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
and	 a 	 long 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 pneumo 	 coccus 	 	or	 an 	 other 	 	bacteria	,	 strepto 	 coccus 	 	and	boom	,	they	get	a	bacterial	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	in	1918	that	was	not	the	case	at	all	.
and	so	far	in	the	h	5n1	 case 	 s 	 	in	people	,	 similar 	 ly 	 	bacterial	 infect 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	an	issue	at	all	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 phenomen 	 al 	 	 disrupt 	 ion 	 	of	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	that	is	the	key	to	why	people	die	of	 th 	 is 	 	virus	.
and	i	would	just	add	we	saw	the	same	thing	with	sars	.
so	what	's	going	on	here	is	your	body	 say 	 s 	 	,	your	 immun 	 e 	 	system	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	out	all	 it 	 s 	 	 senti 	 nel 	 s 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	what	the	heck	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
we	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	even	 remote 	 ly 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	before	.	``
it	wo	n't	do	any	good	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	the	 sharp 	 shoot 	 ers 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 anti 	 bodies 	 	are	n't	here	.
and	it	wo	n't	do	any	good	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	the	 tank 	 s 	 	and	the	 art 	 ille 	 ry 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	t	-	 cell 	 s 	 	do	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	it	either	.
so	we	're	going	to	have	to	go	all	-	out	 thermo 	 nuclear 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	 stimul 	 ate 	 	the	total	 cy 	 to 	 kine 	 	 cascad 	 e 	 	.
the	whole	 immun 	 e 	 	system	 s 	 warm 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 lung 	 s 	 	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	they	die	,	 drown 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 fluid 	 s 	 	,	of	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	.
but	it	's	not	bacterial	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	.
and	it	's	not	a	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	that	would	respond	to	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
and	i	think	my	time	is	up	.	i	thank	you	all	for	your	attention	.
