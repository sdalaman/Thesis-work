there	are	more	chinese	 restaurant 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	than	mcdonald	's	,	burger	king	,	kentucky	fried	chicken	and	wendy	's	,	 combine 	 d 	 	--	40,000	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
chinese	 restaurant 	 s 	 	have	 play 	 ed 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	role	in	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	.
the	cuban	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	crisis	was	resolved	in	a	chinese	restaurant	 call 	 ed 	 	yenching	 pa 	 lace 	 	in	washington	,	d.c.	,	which	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	is	closed	now	,	and	about	to	be	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	walgreen	's	.
and	the	house	that	john	wilkes	booth	 plan 	 ned 	 	the	 assassin 	 ation 	 	of	abraham	lincoln	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	now	a	chinese	restaurant	 call 	 ed 	 	wok	'	n	roll	,	on	h	street	in	washington	.
and	it	's	not	 complete 	 ly 	 	gratuitous	,	 be 	 cause 	 	wok	and	roll	--	chinese	food	and	japanese	 food 	 s 	 	,	so	it	kind	of	 work 	 s 	 	out	.
and	americans	love	 the 	 ir 	 	chinese	food	so	much	they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
nasa	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 serve 	 s 	 	thermal	-	 stabil 	 ized 	 	sweet	-	and	-	 s 	 our 	 	pork	on	 it 	 s 	 	shuttle	menu	for	 it 	 s 	 	 astro 	 nauts 	 	.
so	,	let	me	present	the	question	to	you	:	if	our	 bench 	 mark 	 	for	americanness	is	apple	pie	,	you	should	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	how	often	do	you	eat	apple	pie	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	how	often	do	you	eat	chinese	food	.	right	?
and	if	you	think	about	it	,	a	lot	of	the	 food 	 s 	 	that	you	think	of	or	we	think	of	or	americans	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	chinese	food	are	 bare 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 izable 	 	to	chinese	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	beef	with	 broc 	 coli 	 	,	egg	 roll 	 s 	 	,	general	tso	's	chicken	,	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	,	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	,	the	take	-	out	boxes	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	took	a	whole	bunch	of	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	back	to	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 g 	 ave 	 	them	to	chinese	to	see	how	they	would	react	.
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
should	i	try	it	?
try	it	!
what	is	it	 call 	 ed 	 	?
fortune	cookie	.
there	's	a	piece	of	paper	 in 	 side 	 	!
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
you	've	won	a	prize	!
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
it	's	a	fortune	!
tasty	!
so	,	where	are	they	from	?
the	short	answer	is	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	from	japan	.
and	in	kyoto	,	 out 	 side 	 	,	there	are	still	small	family	-	run	 bake 	 ries 	 	that	make	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	did	over	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	before	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
if	you	see	them	side	by	side	,	there	's	yellow	and	 brow 	 n 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 flavor 	 ed 	 	with	 mis 	 o 	 	and	 s 	 e 	 same 	 	paste	,	so	they	're	not	 a 	 s 	 	sweet	 a 	 s 	 	our	version	.
so	,	how	did	they	get	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	?
well	,	the	short	answer	is	,	the	japanese	 im 	 migrant 	 s 	 	came	over	,	and	a	bunch	of	the	 bake 	 rs 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	them	--	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	in	los	angeles	,	and	one	here	in	san	francisco	 call 	 ed 	 	benkyo	-	do	,	which	is	on	the	corner	of	sutter	and	buchanan	.
they	back	then	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	made	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	using	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	similar	kind	of	 iron 	 s 	 	that	we	saw	back	in	kyoto	.
so	,	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	is	,	how	do	you	go	from	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	japanese	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	chinese	?
well	,	the	short	answer	is	,	we	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	all	the	japanese	 dur 	 ing 	 	world	war	ii	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	that	made	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	,	so	that	's	the	time	when	the	chinese	 move 	 d 	 	in	,	kind	of	saw	a	market	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	took	over	.
so	,	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	:	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	the	japanese	,	 popular 	 ized 	 	by	the	chinese	,	but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	americans	.
they	are	more	american	than	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
 an 	 other 	 	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 dish 	 es 	 	:	general	tso	's	chicken	--	which	,	by	the	way	,	in	the	us	 nav 	 al 	 	academy	is	 call 	 ed 	 	admiral	tso	's	chicken	.
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	dish	.
the	original	name	in	my	book	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	long	march	of	general	tso	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 march 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	far	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	is	sweet	,	he	is	fried	,	and	he	is	chicken	--	all	 thing 	 s 	 	that	americans	love	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 march 	 ed 	 	so	far	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	the	chef	who	 original 	 ly 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	dish	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	it	;	he	's	kind	of	 horr 	 ified 	 	.
he	's	in	taiwan	right	now	.
he	's	 retire 	 d 	 	,	deaf	and	 play 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	mahjong	.
so	,	he	--	after	 th 	 is 	 	i	 show 	 ed 	 	him	,	he	got	up	,	and	he	's	like	,	``	mominqimiao	,	``	which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 non 	 sense 	 	,	``	and	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	play	his	mahjong	game	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	afternoon	.
so	,	 an 	 other 	 	dish	.	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	.	beef	with	 broc 	 coli 	 	.
 broc 	 coli 	 	is	not	a	chinese	 veget 	 able 	 	;	in	fact	,	it	is	 original 	 ly 	 	an	italian	 veget 	 able 	 	.
it	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	the	1800s	,	but	 be 	 came 	 	 popular 	 ized 	 	in	the	1920s	and	the	1930s	.
in	fact	,	the	chinese	had	 the 	 ir 	 	own	version	of	 broc 	 coli 	 	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	chinese	 broc 	 coli 	 	,	but	right	now	,	what	--	they	've	now	 discover 	 ed 	 	american	 broc 	 coli 	 	,	and	are	 import 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	,	sort	of	,	 ex 	 otic 	 	 delic 	 acy 	 	.
i	guarantee	you	,	general	tso	never	saw	a	 s 	 talk 	 	of	 broc 	 coli 	 	in	his	life	--	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	a	picture	of	general	tso	.
i	went	to	his	home	town	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 bill 	 board 	 	that	 say 	 s 	 	:	``	welcome	to	the	 birth 	 place 	 	of	general	tso	.	``
and	i	went	looking	for	chicken	.
 final 	 ly 	 	found	a	cow	--	and	did	find	chicken	.
 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	road	.
and	--	--	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	a	whole	bunch	of	general	tso	's	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	who	are	still	in	the	little	town	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	now	five	 generation 	 s 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	general	;	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	about	seven	.
 show 	 ed 	 	them	all	the	 picture 	 s 	 	of	general	tso	chicken	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	and	they	're	like	,	we	do	n't	know	 th 	 is 	 	dish	.
and	then	they	're	like	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	chinese	food	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	chinese	food	to	them	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	kind	of	 surprise 	 d 	 	i	 travel 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	to	visit	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	he	is	,	after	all	,	a	famous	qing	 dy 	 nasty 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	hero	.
he	 play 	 ed 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	role	in	the	taiping	 rebel 	 lion 	 	,	which	was	a	war	 start 	 ed 	 	by	a	guy	who	thought	he	was	the	son	of	god	and	the	baby	brother	of	jesus	christ	.
and	 caus 	 ed 	 	the	war	that	 kill 	 ed 	 	20	million	people	--	still	the	 dead 	 liest 	 	civil	war	in	the	world	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	.
so	,	you	know	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	when	i	was	there	,	general	tso	is	kind	of	a	lot	like	colonel	sanders	in	america	,	in	that	he	's	known	for	chicken	and	not	war	.
but	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	known	for	war	and	not	chicken	.
but	the	 grand 	 d 	 addy 	 	of	all	the	chinese	-	american	 dish 	 es 	 	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	ought	to	talk	about	is	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	,	which	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	around	the	turn	of	the	20th	century	.
and	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	in	1904	,	there	was	an	 out 	 break 	 	of	chinese	 restaurant 	 s 	 	all	over	town	,	and	``	the	city	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	'	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	'	mad	.	``
so	it	took	about	30	 year 	 s 	 	before	the	americans	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	 who 	 a 	 	,	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	known	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	article	 point 	 s 	 	out	,	``	the	average	native	of	any	city	in	 chin 	 a 	 	 know 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	of	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	.	``
you	know	,	back	then	it	was	a	way	to	show	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	and	 cosmo 	 politan 	 	:	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	guy	and	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	impress	a	girl	,	you	could	take	her	out	on	a	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	date	.
i	like	to	say	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	's	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 cul 	 in 	 ary 	 	joke	that	one	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 play 	 ed 	 	on	 an 	 other 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	,	if	you	 transl 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	chinese	,	 mean 	 s 	 	 ts 	 ap 	 	sui	,	which	,	if	you	 transl 	 ate 	 	back	,	 mean 	 s 	 	``	 odd 	 s 	 	and	 end 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	these	people	are	going	around	 chin 	 a 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	,	which	is	sort	of	like	a	japanese	guy	coming	here	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	i	understand	you	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	dish	in	your	country	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 left 	 over 	 s 	 	,	``	and	it	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	--	--	right	?
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	:	 th 	 is 	 	dish	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	popular	after	that	 holi 	 day 	 	you	call	 thank 	 s 	 giving 	 	.
so	,	why	--	why	and	where	--	did	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	come	from	?
let	's	go	back	to	mid	-	1800s	when	the	chinese	first	came	to	america	.
now	back	then	,	the	americans	 we 	 re 	 	not	 clam 	 or 	 ing 	 	to	eat	chinese	food	.
in	fact	,	they	saw	 th 	 is 	 	people	who	 land 	 ed 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 shore 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	alien	.
these	people	 we 	 re 	 	n't	eating	 dog 	 s 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	eating	 cat 	 s 	 	--	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	eating	 cat 	 s 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	eating	 rat 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	my	 esteem 	 ed 	 	 employ 	 er 	 	,	in	1883	ran	an	article	that	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	do	chinese	eat	 rat 	 s 	 	?	``
and	not	the	most	pc	question	to	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	if	you	kind	of	look	at	the	popular	 image 	 ry 	 	of	the	time	,	not	so	outlandish	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	real	 advertise 	 ment 	 	for	rat	poison	from	the	late	1800s	,	and	if	you	see	,	under	the	word	``	 clear 	 s 	 	``	--	 ver 	 y 	 	small	--	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	they	must	go	,	``	which	 refer 	 s 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	the	 rat 	 s 	 	,	but	to	the	chinese	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 mid 	 st 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	way	that	the	food	was	 perceive 	 d 	 	was	that	these	people	who	ate	 food 	 s 	 	different	from	us	must	be	different	from	us	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	way	that	you	saw	,	sort	of	,	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	,	 th 	 is 	 	 anti 	 pathy 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	chinese	is	through	 document 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	library	of	congress	;	it	is	a	pamphlet	 publish 	 ed 	 	by	samuel	gompers	,	hero	of	our	american	labor	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	some	reason	for	chinese	 ex 	 clusion 	 	:	meat	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	rice	:	american	 man 	 hood 	 	against	asiatic	coolieism	:	which	 s 	 hall 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	?
and	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	made	the	argument	that	chinese	men	who	ate	rice	would	 necess 	 arily 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	down	the	standard	of	living	for	american	men	who	ate	meat	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	then	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	must	exclude	them	from	 th 	 is 	 	country	so	,	with	 sentiment 	 s 	 	like	these	,	the	chinese	 ex 	 clusion 	 	act	was	sort	of	 pass 	 ed 	 	between	1882	and	1902	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	time	in	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	when	a	group	was	 specific 	 ally 	 	 exclude 	 d 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	national	origin	or	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	.
so	,	in	a	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	chinese	 we 	 re 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	,	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	was	 create 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	defense	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
now	,	who	came	up	with	the	idea	of	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	?
there	's	a	lot	of	different	 myster 	 ies 	 	,	a	lot	of	different	 legend 	 s 	 	,	but	of	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	i	've	found	that	i	thought	was	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	article	from	1904	.
a	chinese	guy	named	lem	sen	 show 	 s 	 	up	in	chinatown	,	new	york	city	,	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	i	want	you	 guy 	 s 	 	all	to	stop	making	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	the	original	creator	and	sole	proprietor	of	the	dish	known	 a 	 s 	 	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	.
and	the	way	that	he	 tell 	 s 	 	it	,	there	was	a	guy	,	there	was	a	famous	chinese	diplomat	that	 show 	 ed 	 	up	,	and	he	was	told	to	make	a	dish	that	 look 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	and	could	,	quote	,	``	pass	``	 a 	 s 	 	chinese	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	--	we	would	never	print	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	american	man	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	.
lem	sen	,	who	's	 th 	 is 	 	guy	:	i	would	have	made	 th 	 is 	 	money	,	too	,	but	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	time	looking	for	the	american	man	who	stole	my	recipe	.
now	i	've	come	and	found	him	,	and	i	want	my	recipe	back	and	i	want	 every 	 one 	 	to	stop	making	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	,	or	pay	me	for	the	right	to	do	the	same	.
so	it	was	an	early	 exercis 	 e 	 	of	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.
so	the	thing	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	idea	of	chinese	-	american	food	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	 on 	 ly 	 	in	america	.
in	fact	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	chinese	food	is	the	most	pervasive	food	on	the	planet	,	 serv 	 ed 	 	on	all	seven	 continent 	 s 	 	,	even	antarctica	,	 be 	 cause 	 	monday	night	is	chinese	food	night	at	mcmurdo	station	,	which	is	the	main	scientific	station	in	antarctica	.
so	,	you	see	different	 varie 	 ties 	 	of	chinese	food	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	is	french	chinese	food	,	where	they	serve	salt	and	pepper	frog	 leg 	 s 	 	.
there	is	italian	chinese	food	,	where	they	do	n't	have	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	,	so	they	serve	fried	 gel 	 ato 	 	.
my	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	neighbor	,	alessandra	,	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	when	i	told	her	,	``	 du 	 de 	 	,	fried	 gel 	 ato 	 	is	not	chinese	.	``
she	's	like	,	``	it	's	not	?
but	they	serve	it	in	all	the	chinese	 restaurant 	 s 	 	in	italy	.	``
and	even	the	brits	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	version	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dish	 call 	 ed 	 	 crisp 	 y 	 	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	beef	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	crisp	,	a	lot	of	shred	,	and	not	a	lot	of	beef	.
there	is	west	indian	chinese	food	,	there	's	jamaican	chinese	food	,	there	is	middle	eastern	chinese	food	,	there	's	mauritian	chinese	food	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dish	 call 	 ed 	 	magic	bowl	that	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
there	's	indian	chinese	food	,	korean	chinese	food	,	japanese	chinese	food	,	where	they	take	the	bao	,	the	little	 bun 	 s 	 	,	and	they	make	them	 in 	 to 	 	pizza	 version 	 s 	 	,	and	they	take	--	and	they	--	like	,	 total 	 ly 	 	 random 	 ly 	 	they	'll	take	chinese	 noodl 	 e 	 	 dish 	 es 	 	,	and	they	'll	just	 ram 	 en 	 	-	ize	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	like	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	in	the	chinese	version	 ha 	 s 	 	no	soup	.
so	,	there	's	peruvian	chinese	food	,	which	should	not	be	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	mexican	chinese	food	,	where	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	take	 thing 	 s 	 	and	make	it	look	like	fajitas	.
and	then	--	one	thing	:	they	have	 thing 	 s 	 	like	risotto	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	.
my	personal	 favor 	 ite 	 	of	all	the	 restaurant 	 s 	 	i	've	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	was	 th 	 is 	 	one	in	brazil	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 k 	 ung 	 	food	.	``
so	,	let	's	take	a	step	back	,	and	kind	of	,	understand	what	is	to	be	 appreciate 	 d 	 	in	america	.
mcdonald	's	 ha 	 s 	 	,	sort	of	,	 gar 	 ner 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	attention	,	a	lot	of	respect	,	for	 bas 	 ically 	 	 standard 	 izing 	 	the	menu	,	décor	and	 din 	 ing 	 	experience	in	post	-	world	war	ii	america	.
but	you	know	what	?
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	so	through	a	 central 	 ized 	 	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	out	of	illinois	,	right	?
chinese	 restaurant 	 s 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	 large 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	,	i	would	 argu 	 e 	 	,	with	the	menu	and	the	décor	--	even	the	restaurant	name	--	but	 with 	 out 	 	a	 central 	 ized 	 	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	to	me	with	the	march	30	,	2005	powerball	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	where	,	you	know	,	they	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	based	on	the	number	of	ticket	 sale 	 s 	 	they	had	,	to	have	three	or	four	second	-	place	 winner 	 s 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	people	who	match	five	or	six	powerball	 number 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	they	had	110	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
they	 look 	 ed 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	,	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	it	could	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	be	fraud	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	,	in	different	 state 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	different	computer	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	 what 	 ever 	 	it	was	,	it	 caus 	 ed 	 	people	to	sort	of	 behav 	 e 	 	in	a	mass	 synchron 	 ized 	 	way	.
so	,	like	,	ok	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	had	to	do	with	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	on	the	little	 piece 	 s 	 	of	paper	--	you	know	,	like	,	it	was	a	diamond	,	or	,	you	know	,	diagonal	.
it	was	n't	that	.
it	was	n't	that	,	so	they	're	like	,	ok	,	let	's	look	at	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	so	they	 look 	 ed 	 	at	an	episode	of	``	lost	.	``
now	,	i	do	n't	have	a	tv	,	which	 make 	 s 	 	me	a	freak	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	productive	,	and	--	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	episode	of	``	lost	,	``	i	understand	,	where	the	 over 	 weight 	 	guy	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 luck 	 y 	 	number	which	was	not	a	 luck 	 y 	 	number	,	which	was	how	long	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	,	but	they	 look 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	 number 	 s 	 	did	not	match	.
so	they	 look 	 ed 	 	at	``	the	young	and	the	 rest 	 less 	 	,	``	and	it	was	n't	that	,	either	.
so	,	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	the	first	guy	 show 	 s 	 	up	the	next	day	,	and	they	ask	him	,	``	where	did	you	get	your	number	from	?	``
he	's	like	,	``	oh	,	i	got	it	from	a	fortune	cookie	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	a	slip	that	one	of	the	 winner 	 s 	 	had	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	tennessee	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	security	 official 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	oh	,	no	--	like	,	 th 	 is 	 	ca	n't	be	true	.
but	it	was	true	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	of	 t 	 hose 	 	110	people	,	and	104	of	them	or	so	had	gotten	 the 	 ir 	 	number	from	the	fortune	cookie	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.	so	,	i	went	and	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	.
i	went	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	,	looking	for	these	 restaurant 	 s 	 	where	these	people	had	gotten	 the 	 ir 	 	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	from	.
you	know	,	there	are	a	bunch	of	them	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	lee	's	 chin 	 a 	 	in	omaha	--	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	run	by	koreans	,	but	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	point	--	and	a	bunch	of	them	named	 chin 	 a 	 	buffet	.
so	,	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 we 	 re 	 	similar	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	different	.
it	was	lunch	,	it	was	take	-	out	,	it	was	 s 	 it 	 	-	down	,	it	was	buffet	,	it	was	three	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	it	was	three	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
but	at	some	point	,	all	these	people	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	experience	that	 converg 	 ed 	 	at	a	fortune	cookie	and	at	a	chinese	restaurant	,	and	all	these	chinese	 restaurant 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 serv 	 ing 	 	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	,	which	,	of	course	we	know	are	n't	even	chinese	to	begin	with	.
so	it	's	kind	of	part	of	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	i	 call 	 ed 	 	 spontane 	 ous 	 	self	-	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	right	,	where	,	like	in	ant	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	where	little	 decision 	 s 	 	made	by	--	on	the	micro	-	level	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	big	impact	on	the	macro	-	level	.
so	,	a	good	sort	of	contrast	is	chicken	mcnuggets	.
mcdonald	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	coming	out	with	a	chicken	-	like	product	.
they	did	chicken	pot	pie	,	they	did	fried	chicken	,	and	then	they	 final 	 ly 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	chicken	mcnuggets	.
and	the	great	 innov 	 ation 	 	of	chicken	mcnuggets	was	not	 nugget 	 f 	 y 	 ing 	 	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	kind	of	an	easy	 con 	 cept 	 	,	but	the	trick	 be 	 hind 	 	chicken	mcnuggets	was	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	chicken	from	the	bone	in	a	cost	-	effective	manner	,	which	is	why	it	took	so	long	for	other	people	to	copy	them	.
it	took	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 with 	 in 	 	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	,	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	hit	they	just	 introduc 	 ed 	 	it	and	 roll 	 ed 	 	it	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	system	of	mcdonald	's	in	the	country	.
in	contrast	,	we	have	general	tso	's	chicken	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	in	new	york	city	in	the	early	1970s	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	in	the	university	in	new	york	city	in	the	early	1970s	,	so	...
and	 th 	 is 	 	logo	!
so	me	,	general	tso	's	chicken	and	 th 	 is 	 	logo	are	all	 karma 	 call 	 y 	 	related	.
but	that	dish	 al 	 so 	 	took	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	to	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	america	from	a	random	restaurant	in	new	york	city	.
 some 	 one 	 	's	like	,	oh	,	god	--	it	's	sweet	,	it	's	fried	,	it	's	chicken	:	americans	will	love	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	what	i	like	to	say	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	sort	of	 ba 	 y 	 	area	,	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	--	is	that	we	think	of	mcdonald	's	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	the	 micro 	 soft 	 	of	the	 din 	 ing 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
we	can	think	of	chinese	 restaurant 	 s 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	linux	:	sort	of	an	open	source	thing	,	right	,	where	 idea 	 s 	 	from	one	person	can	be	 cop 	 ied 	 	and	 propag 	 ated 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	system	,	that	there	can	be	 special 	 ized 	 	 version 	 s 	 	of	chinese	food	,	you	know	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	region	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	know	,	in	new	orleans	we	have	cajun	chinese	food	,	where	they	serve	sichuan	 all 	 igator 	 	and	sweet	and	 s 	 our 	 	 c 	 raw 	 fish 	 	,	right	?
and	in	philadelphia	,	you	have	philadelphia	 cheese 	 steak 	 	roll	,	which	 look 	 s 	 	like	an	egg	roll	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	but	a	 cheese 	 steak 	 	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	discover	that	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	philadelphia	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	in	atlanta	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	a	chinese	family	had	 move 	 d 	 	from	atlanta	to	--	sorry	,	from	philadelphia	to	atlanta	,	and	 br 	 ought 	 	that	with	them	.
so	,	the	thing	is	,	our	 historic 	 al 	 	lore	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	way	we	like	 narrative 	 s 	 	,	are	full	of	vast	 character 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	howard	schultz	of	starbucks	and	ray	kroc	with	mcdonald	's	and	asa	chandler	with	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	.
but	,	you	know	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	overlook	the	 small 	 er 	 	 character 	 s 	 	--	 oop 	 s 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	like	lem	sen	,	who	 introduc 	 ed 	 	chop	 su 	 ey 	 	,	chef	peng	,	who	 introduc 	 ed 	 	general	tso	chicken	,	and	all	the	japanese	 bake 	 rs 	 	who	 introduc 	 ed 	 	fortune	 cookie 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	point	of	my	 present 	 ation 	 	is	to	make	you	think	twice	,	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 name 	 s 	 	are	 for 	 gotten 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	can	often	have	had	 a 	 s 	 	much	,	if	not	more	,	impact	on	what	we	eat	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
