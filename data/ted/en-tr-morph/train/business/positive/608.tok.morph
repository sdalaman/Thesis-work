take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
it	 pose 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	for	us	.
these	african	 student 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 work 	 	under	 street 	 light 	 s 	 	at	the	 air 	 port 	 	in	the	capital	city	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	any	 electric 	 ity 	 	at	home	.
now	,	i	have	n't	met	these	 part 	 icular 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	but	i	've	met	 student 	 s 	 	like	them	.
let	's	just	pick	one	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	one	in	the	green	shirt	.
let	's	give	him	a	name	,	too	:	nelson	.
i	'll	bet	nelson	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 cell 	 phone 	 	.
so	here	is	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
why	is	it	that	nelson	 ha 	 s 	 	access	to	a	cutting	-	edge	technology	,	like	the	 cell 	 phone 	 	,	but	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	access	to	a	100	-	year	-	old	technology	for	generating	electric	light	in	the	home	?
now	,	in	a	word	,	the	answer	is	``	 rule 	 s 	 	.	``
bad	 rule 	 s 	 	can	prevent	the	kind	of	win	-	win	solution	that	's	 avail 	 able 	 	when	people	can	 br 	 ing 	 	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	in	and	make	them	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 some 	 one 	 	like	nelson	.
what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 rule 	 s 	 	?
the	electric	company	in	 th 	 is 	 	nation	 oper 	 ates 	 	under	a	rule	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	sell	 electric 	 ity 	 	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	,	 subsidize 	 d 	 	price	--	in	fact	,	a	price	that	is	so	low	it	 lose 	 s 	 	money	on	every	unit	that	it	 sell 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 n 	 either 	 	the	 resource 	 s 	 	,	nor	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	,	to	hook	up	 man 	 y 	 	other	 user 	 s 	 	.
the	 p 	 resident 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	change	 th 	 is 	 	rule	.
he	's	 s 	 een 	 	that	it	's	possible	to	have	a	different	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	,	 rule 	 s 	 	where	 business 	 es 	 	earn	a	small	profit	,	so	they	have	an	incentive	to	sign	up	more	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
that	's	the	kind	of	 rule 	 s 	 	that	the	 cell 	 phone 	 	company	that	nelson	 purchase 	 s 	 	his	 tele 	 phony 	 	from	 oper 	 ates 	 	under	.
the	 p 	 resident 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	well	.
so	he	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	change	the	 rule 	 s 	 	for	 pric 	 ing 	 	on	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	but	ran	 in 	 to 	 	a	 fire 	 storm 	 	of	protest	from	 business 	 es 	 	and	 consumer 	 s 	 	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	preserve	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 subsidize 	 d 	 	rates	.
so	he	was	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	 rule 	 s 	 	that	 prevent 	 ed 	 	him	from	 lett 	 ing 	 	the	win	-	win	solution	help	his	country	.
and	nelson	is	 s 	 tuck 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	under	the	 street 	 light 	 s 	 	.
the	real	 challeng 	 e 	 	then	,	is	to	try	to	figure	out	how	we	can	change	 rule 	 s 	 	.
are	there	some	 rule 	 s 	 	we	can	develop	for	changing	 rule 	 s 	 	?
i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	there	is	a	general	abstract	 in 	 sight 	 	that	we	can	make	practical	,	which	is	that	,	if	we	can	give	more	 choice 	 s 	 	to	people	,	and	more	 choice 	 s 	 	to	 lead 	 ers 	 	--	who	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	are	 al 	 so 	 	people	.
but	,	it	's	 use 	 ful 	 	to	present	the	 op 	 position 	 	between	these	two	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	kind	of	choice	you	might	want	to	give	to	a	 lead 	 er 	 	,	a	choice	like	giving	the	 p 	 resident 	 	the	choice	to	raise	 price 	 s 	 	on	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	 take 	 s 	 	away	a	choice	that	people	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	want	.
they	want	the	choice	to	be	able	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 consum 	 ing 	 	 subsidize 	 d 	 	electric	power	.
so	if	you	give	just	to	one	side	or	the	other	,	you	'll	have	tension	or	friction	.
but	if	we	can	find	ways	to	give	more	 choice 	 s 	 	to	both	,	that	will	give	us	a	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	for	changing	 rule 	 s 	 	that	get	us	out	of	 trap 	 s 	 	.
now	,	nelson	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	access	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	that	if	you	want	to	see	the	 dam 	 aging 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 rule 	 s 	 	,	the	ways	that	 rule 	 s 	 	can	keep	people	in	the	dark	,	look	at	the	 picture 	 s 	 	from	nasa	of	the	earth	at	night	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	check	out	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
if	you	zoom	in	here	,	you	can	see	north	korea	,	in	 out 	 line 	 	here	,	which	is	like	a	black	hole	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
now	,	you	wo	n't	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	learn	that	the	 rule 	 s 	 	in	north	korea	keep	people	there	in	the	dark	.
but	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	north	korea	and	south	korea	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	 ident 	 ical 	 	 set 	 s 	 	of	 rule 	 s 	 	in	both	the	sense	of	 law 	 s 	 	and	 regulat 	 ions 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	 deep 	 er 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 norm 	 s 	 	,	culture	,	 value 	 s 	 	and	 belief 	 s 	 	.
when	they	 separat 	 ed 	 	,	they	made	 choice 	 s 	 	that	led	to	 ver 	 y 	 	 diverge 	 nt 	 	 path 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 set 	 s 	 	of	 rule 	 s 	 	.
so	we	can	change	--	we	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	can	change	the	 rule 	 s 	 	that	we	use	to	interact	with	each	other	,	for	better	,	or	for	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
now	let	's	look	at	 an 	 other 	 	region	,	the	caribbean	.
zoom	in	on	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	in	 out 	 line 	 	here	.
 ha 	 iti 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	dark	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	neighbor	here	,	the	dominican	 re 	 public 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	about	the	same	number	of	 resident 	 s 	 	.
both	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	are	dark	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	puerto	rico	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	half	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 resident 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	either	 ha 	 iti 	 	or	the	dominican	 re 	 public 	 	.
what	 ha 	 iti 	 	 war 	 ns 	 	us	is	that	 rule 	 s 	 	can	be	bad	 be 	 cause 	 	 government 	 s 	 	are	weak	.
it	's	not	just	that	the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	bad	 be 	 cause 	 	the	government	is	too	strong	and	 oppress 	 ive 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	north	korea	.
so	that	if	we	want	to	create	 environment 	 s 	 	with	good	 rule 	 s 	 	,	we	ca	n't	just	tear	down	.
we	've	got	to	find	ways	to	build	up	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
now	,	 chin 	 a 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 demonst 	 rates 	 	both	the	potential	and	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 rule 	 s 	 	.
back	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	data	 present 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	chart	,	 chin 	 a 	 	was	the	world	's	high	-	technology	 lead 	 er 	 	.
chinese	had	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	like	steel	,	 print 	 ing 	 	,	 gun 	 powder 	 	.
but	the	chinese	never	 adopt 	 ed 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	that	period	,	effective	 rule 	 s 	 	for	 encourag 	 ing 	 	the	spread	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	--	a	profit	motive	that	could	have	 encourag 	 ed 	 	the	spread	.
and	they	soon	 adopt 	 ed 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	which	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	cut	 chin 	 a 	 	off	from	the	rest	of	the	world	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	other	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	 innov 	 ated 	 	,	in	the	sense	both	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 new 	 er 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 new 	 er 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	,	the	chinese	 we 	 re 	 	cut	off	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	.
income	there	 stay 	 ed 	 	 stag 	 nant 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 zoom 	 ed 	 	 a 	 head 	 	in	the	rest	of	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	next	chart	 look 	 s 	 	at	more	 re 	 cent 	 	data	.
it	 plot 	 s 	 	income	,	average	income	in	 chin 	 a 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 percent 	 age 	 	of	average	income	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
in	the	'50s	and	'60s	you	can	see	that	it	was	 hover 	 ing 	 	at	about	three	percent	.
but	then	in	the	late	'70s	 some 	 thing 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
growth	took	off	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.	the	chinese	 start 	 ed 	 	 catch 	 ing 	 	up	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	with	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
if	you	go	back	to	the	map	at	night	,	you	can	get	a	clue	to	the	process	that	lead	to	the	 dramat 	 ic 	 	change	in	 rule 	 s 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
the	 bright 	 est 	 	spot	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	which	you	can	see	on	the	edge	of	the	 out 	 line 	 	here	,	is	hong	kong	.
hong	kong	was	a	small	bit	of	 chin 	 a 	 	that	,	for	most	of	the	20th	century	,	 oper 	 ated 	 	under	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	than	the	rest	of	 main 	 land 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	--	 rule 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 cop 	 ied 	 	from	 work 	 ing 	 	market	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	of	the	time	,	and	 administer 	 ed 	 	by	the	british	.
in	the	1950s	,	hong	kong	was	a	place	where	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	could	go	,	from	the	 main 	 land 	 	,	to	start	in	 job 	 s 	 	like	 sew 	 ing 	 	 shirt 	 s 	 	,	making	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
but	,	to	get	on	a	process	of	increasing	income	,	increasing	 skill 	 s 	 	led	to	 ver 	 y 	 	rapid	growth	there	.
hong	kong	was	 al 	 so 	 	the	model	which	 lead 	 ers 	 	like	deng	xiaoping	could	copy	,	when	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	move	all	of	the	 main 	 land 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	market	model	.
but	deng	xiaoping	 instinct 	 ively 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	to	his	people	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	forcing	 every 	 one 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	to	shift	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	to	the	market	model	,	they	 proceed 	 ed 	 	by	creating	some	special	 zone 	 s 	 	that	could	do	,	in	a	sense	,	what	britain	did	:	make	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	go	work	with	the	market	 rule 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	the	people	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	opt	in	there	.
so	they	 create 	 d 	 	four	special	economic	 zone 	 s 	 	around	hong	kong	:	 zone 	 s 	 	where	chinese	could	come	and	work	,	and	cities	grew	up	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	there	;	 al 	 so 	 	 zone 	 s 	 	where	foreign	 firm 	 s 	 	could	come	in	and	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 zone 	 s 	 	next	to	hong	kong	 ha 	 s 	 	a	city	 call 	 ed 	 	shenzhen	.
in	that	city	there	is	a	taiwanese	firm	that	made	the	iphone	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	,	and	they	made	it	with	labor	from	chinese	who	 move 	 d 	 	there	to	shenzhen	.
so	after	the	four	special	 zone 	 s 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	14	 coast 	 al 	 	 cite 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	open	in	the	same	sense	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 demonst 	 rated 	 	 success 	 es 	 	in	these	 place 	 s 	 	that	people	could	opt	in	to	,	that	they	 flock 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 advantage 	 s 	 	they	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	.
 demonst 	 rated 	 	 success 	 es 	 	there	led	to	a	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	for	a	move	 to 	 ward 	 	the	market	model	for	the	entire	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
now	the	chinese	 ex 	 ample 	 	 show 	 s 	 	us	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 point 	 s 	 	.
one	is	:	preserve	 choice 	 s 	 	for	people	.
two	:	 oper 	 ate 	 	on	the	right	scale	.
if	you	try	to	change	the	 rule 	 s 	 	in	a	village	,	you	could	do	that	,	but	a	village	would	be	too	small	to	get	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 benefit 	 s 	 	you	can	get	if	you	have	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	all	 work 	 ing 	 	under	good	 rule 	 s 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	the	nation	is	too	big	.
if	you	try	to	change	the	 rule 	 s 	 	in	the	nation	,	you	ca	n't	give	some	people	a	chance	to	hold	back	,	see	how	 thing 	 s 	 	turn	out	,	and	let	 other 	 s 	 	zoom	 a 	 head 	 	and	try	the	new	 rule 	 s 	 	.
but	cities	give	you	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	create	new	 place 	 s 	 	,	with	new	 rule 	 s 	 	that	people	can	opt	in	to	.
and	they	're	large	 en 	 ough 	 	to	get	all	of	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	that	we	can	have	when	 million 	 s 	 	of	us	work	together	under	good	 rule 	 s 	 	.
so	the	proposal	is	that	we	 conceiv 	 e 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 chart 	 er 	 	city	.
we	start	with	a	 chart 	 er 	 	that	 spec 	 ifies 	 	all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	attract	the	people	who	we	'll	need	to	build	the	city	.
we	'll	need	to	attract	the	 invest 	 ors 	 	who	will	build	out	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	--	the	power	system	,	the	 road 	 s 	 	,	the	port	,	the	 air 	 port 	 	,	the	 building 	 s 	 	.
you	'll	need	to	attract	 firm 	 s 	 	,	who	will	come	hire	the	people	who	move	there	first	.
and	you	'll	need	to	attract	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	the	 resident 	 s 	 	who	will	come	and	live	there	 permanent 	 ly 	 	,	raise	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	get	an	education	for	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	and	get	 the 	 ir 	 	first	job	.
with	that	 chart 	 er 	 	,	people	will	move	there	.
the	city	can	be	built	.
and	we	can	scale	 th 	 is 	 	model	.
we	can	go	do	it	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
to	make	it	work	,	we	need	good	 rule 	 s 	 	.	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 discuss 	 ed 	 	that	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 capture 	 d 	 	in	the	 chart 	 er 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	need	the	 choice 	 s 	 	for	people	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	built	 in 	 to 	 	the	model	if	we	allow	for	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	building	cities	on	 un 	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	land	.
you	start	from	 un 	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	.
people	can	come	live	under	the	new	 chart 	 er 	 	,	but	no	one	is	 force 	 d 	 	to	live	under	it	.
the	final	thing	we	need	are	 choice 	 s 	 	for	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	,	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	kind	of	 choice 	 s 	 	we	want	for	 lead 	 ers 	 	we	need	to	allow	for	the	potential	for	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	between	 nation 	 s 	 	:	 case 	 s 	 	where	 nation 	 s 	 	work	together	,	in	effect	,	de	 fact 	 o 	 	,	the	way	 chin 	 a 	 	and	britain	 work 	 ed 	 	together	to	build	,	first	a	little	enclave	of	the	market	model	,	and	then	scale	it	 through 	 out 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	.
in	a	sense	,	britain	,	 in 	 advert 	 ent 	 ly 	 	,	through	 it 	 s 	 	 action 	 s 	 	in	hong	kong	,	did	more	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	world	poverty	than	all	the	aid	 program 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 under 	 taken 	 	in	the	last	century	.
so	if	we	allow	for	these	kind	of	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	to	replicate	 th 	 is 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	can	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 benefit 	 s 	 	 scale 	 d 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	.
in	some	 case 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	will	involve	a	 deleg 	 ation 	 	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	a	 deleg 	 ation 	 	of	control	from	one	country	to	 an 	 other 	 	to	take	over	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 administr 	 ative 	 	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	.
now	,	when	i	say	that	,	some	of	you	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	think	,	``	well	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	just	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	back	 colonial 	 ism 	 	?	``
it	's	not	.	but	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	the	kind	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	that	come	up	when	we	start	to	think	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	can	get	in	the	way	,	can	make	us	pull	back	,	can	shut	down	our	ability	,	and	our	interest	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explore	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	not	like	 colonial 	 ism 	 	?
the	thing	that	was	bad	about	 colonial 	 ism 	 	,	and	the	thing	which	is	 residual 	 ly 	 	bad	in	some	of	our	aid	 program 	 s 	 	,	is	that	it	 involve 	 d 	 	 element 	 s 	 	of	 coerc 	 ion 	 	and	 con 	 descens 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	model	is	all	about	 choice 	 s 	 	,	both	for	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	for	the	people	who	will	live	in	these	new	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	,	choice	is	the	antidote	to	 coerc 	 ion 	 	and	 con 	 descens 	 ion 	 	.
so	let	's	talk	about	how	 th 	 is 	 	could	play	out	in	practice	.
let	's	take	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	,	raul	castro	,	who	is	the	 lead 	 er 	 	of	cuba	.
it	must	have	 occur 	 red 	 	to	castro	that	he	 ha 	 s 	 	the	chance	to	do	for	cuba	what	deng	xiaoping	did	for	 chin 	 a 	 	,	but	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	hong	kong	there	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	in	cuba	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	have	a	little	bit	of	light	down	in	the	south	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	 stat 	 us 	 	.
there	is	a	zone	there	,	around	guantanamo	 ba 	 y 	 	,	where	a	 treat 	 y 	 	 give 	 s 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	for	a	piece	of	land	that	's	about	twice	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	manhattan	.
castro	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	canada	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	look	,	the	yankees	have	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	pr	problem	.
they	want	to	get	out	.
why	do	n't	you	,	canada	,	take	over	?
build	--	run	a	special	 administr 	 ative 	 	zone	.
allow	a	new	city	to	be	built	up	there	.
allow	 man 	 y 	 	people	to	come	in	.
let	us	have	a	hong	kong	 near 	 by 	 	.
some	of	my	 citizen 	 s 	 	will	move	 in 	 to 	 	that	city	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 other 	 s 	 	will	hold	back	.	but	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	the	 gate 	 way 	 	that	will	connect	the	modern	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	the	modern	world	to	my	country	.	``
now	,	where	else	might	 th 	 is 	 	model	be	 tri 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	africa	.	i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	with	 lead 	 ers 	 	in	africa	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	them	 total 	 ly 	 	get	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	special	zone	that	people	can	opt	 in 	 to 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	rule	.
it	's	a	rule	for	changing	 rule 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	way	to	create	new	 rule 	 s 	 	,	and	let	people	opt	-	in	 with 	 out 	 	 coerc 	 ion 	 	,	and	the	 op 	 position 	 	that	 coerc 	 ion 	 	can	force	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	get	the	idea	that	in	some	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	they	can	make	more	credible	 promise 	 s 	 	to	long	-	term	 invest 	 ors 	 	--	the	kind	of	 invest 	 ors 	 	who	will	come	build	the	port	,	build	the	 road 	 s 	 	,	in	a	new	city	--	they	can	make	more	credible	 promise 	 s 	 	if	they	do	it	 a 	 long 	 	with	a	partner	nation	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	in	some	 arrange 	 ment 	 	that	's	a	little	bit	like	an	 es 	 crow 	 	account	,	where	you	put	land	in	the	 es 	 crow 	 	account	and	the	partner	nation	 take 	 s 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	it	.
there	is	 al 	 so 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	land	in	africa	where	new	cities	could	be	built	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	i	took	when	i	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	coast	.
there	are	immense	 stretch 	 es 	 	of	land	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	land	where	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	could	live	.
now	,	if	we	 general 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	think	about	not	just	one	or	two	 chart 	 er 	 	 cite 	 s 	 	,	but	 dozen 	 s 	 	--	cities	that	will	help	create	 place 	 s 	 	for	the	 man 	 y 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	people	who	will	move	to	cities	in	the	coming	century	--	is	there	 en 	 ough 	 	land	for	them	?
well	,	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	,	if	we	look	at	the	 light 	 s 	 	at	night	,	the	one	thing	that	's	 mis 	 lead 	 ing 	 	is	that	,	 visual 	 ly 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	most	of	the	world	is	 al 	 ready 	 	built	out	.
so	let	me	show	you	why	that	's	wrong	.
take	 th 	 is 	 	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	all	of	the	land	.
turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	square	that	 stand 	 s 	 	for	all	the	 ar 	 able 	 	land	on	earth	.
and	let	these	 dot 	 s 	 	represent	the	land	that	's	 al 	 ready 	 	taken	up	by	the	cities	that	three	billion	people	now	live	in	.
if	you	move	the	 dot 	 s 	 	down	to	the	bottom	of	the	 rect 	 angle 	 	you	can	see	that	the	cities	for	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	three	billion	urban	 resident 	 s 	 	take	up	 on 	 ly 	 	three	percent	of	the	 ar 	 able 	 	land	on	earth	.
so	if	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	cities	for	 an 	 other 	 	billion	people	,	they	would	be	 dot 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	'd	go	from	three	percent	of	the	 ar 	 able 	 	land	,	to	four	percent	.
we	'd	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	human	 foot 	 print 	 	on	earth	by	building	more	cities	that	people	can	move	to	.
and	if	these	are	cities	 govern 	 ed 	 	by	good	 rule 	 s 	 	,	they	can	be	cities	where	people	are	safe	from	crime	,	safe	from	disease	and	bad	 sanit 	 ation 	 	,	where	people	have	a	chance	to	get	a	job	.
they	can	get	 bas 	 ic 	 	 util 	 ities 	 	like	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	can	get	an	education	.
so	what	will	it	take	to	get	 start 	 ed 	 	building	the	first	 chart 	 er 	 	cities	,	 scal 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	so	we	build	 man 	 y 	 	more	?
it	would	help	to	have	a	manual	.
what	university	 professor 	 s 	 	could	do	is	write	some	 detail 	 s 	 	that	might	go	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	manual	.
you	would	n't	want	to	let	us	run	the	cities	,	go	out	and	design	them	.
you	would	n't	let	 academic 	 s 	 	out	in	the	wild	.
but	,	you	could	set	us	to	work	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 question 	 s 	 	like	,	suppose	it	is	n't	just	canada	that	 do 	 es 	 	the	deal	with	raul	castro	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	brazil	 come 	 s 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 	a	 particip 	 ant 	 	,	and	spain	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	cuba	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	one	of	the	 partner 	 s 	 	in	a	four	-	way	joint	venture	.
how	would	we	write	the	 treat 	 y 	 	to	do	that	?
there	is	less	 precede 	 nt 	 	for	that	,	but	that	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	be	 work 	 ed 	 	out	.
how	would	we	finance	 th 	 is 	 	?
 turn 	 s 	 	out	singapore	and	hong	kong	are	cities	that	made	huge	 gain 	 s 	 	on	the	value	of	the	land	that	they	owned	when	they	got	 start 	 ed 	 	.
you	could	use	the	 gain 	 s 	 	on	the	value	of	the	land	to	pay	for	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	police	,	the	 court 	 s 	 	,	but	the	school	system	and	the	health	care	system	too	,	which	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	more	 attract 	 ive 	 	place	to	live	,	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	a	place	where	people	have	 high 	 er 	 	 income 	 s 	 	--	which	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	 make 	 s 	 	the	land	more	 valu 	 able 	 	.
so	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	for	the	people	 help 	 ing 	 	to	construct	 th 	 is 	 	zone	and	build	it	,	and	set	up	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	,	go	 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	the	right	direction	.
so	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	other	 detail 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
how	could	we	have	 building 	 s 	 	that	are	low	cost	and	 afford 	 able 	 	for	people	who	work	in	a	first	job	,	 assem 	 bling 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	an	iphone	,	but	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 building 	 s 	 	energy	efficient	,	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	are	safe	,	so	they	do	n't	fall	down	in	an	 earth 	 quake 	 	or	a	hurricane	.
 man 	 y 	 	technical	 detail 	 s 	 	to	be	 work 	 ed 	 	out	,	but	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	pursue	these	 thing 	 s 	 	can	 al 	 ready 	 	tell	that	there	is	no	 road 	 block 	 	,	there	's	no	impediment	,	other	than	a	failure	of	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	that	will	keep	us	from	 deliver 	 ing 	 	on	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	win	-	win	solution	.
let	me	conclude	with	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
the	reason	we	can	be	so	well	off	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	there	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	on	earth	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	power	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
we	can	share	 idea 	 s 	 	with	other	people	,	and	when	they	discover	them	,	they	share	with	us	.
it	's	not	like	scarce	 object 	 s 	 	,	where	sharing	 mean 	 s 	 	we	each	get	less	.
when	we	share	 idea 	 s 	 	we	all	get	more	.
when	we	think	about	 idea 	 s 	 	in	that	way	,	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	think	about	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
but	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	class	of	 idea 	 s 	 	:	the	 rule 	 s 	 	that	govern	how	we	interact	with	each	other	;	 rule 	 s 	 	like	,	let	's	have	a	tax	system	that	 support 	 s 	 	a	research	university	that	 give 	 s 	 	away	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	knowledge	for	free	.
let	's	have	a	system	where	we	have	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	land	that	is	 register 	 ed 	 	in	a	government	 off 	 ice 	 	,	that	people	can	 pledg 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 col 	 lateral 	 	.
if	we	can	keep	 innov 	 ating 	 	on	our	space	of	 rule 	 s 	 	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 innov 	 ate 	 	in	the	sense	of	coming	up	with	 rule 	 s 	 	for	changing	 rule 	 s 	 	,	so	we	do	n't	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	bad	 rule 	 s 	 	,	then	we	can	keep	moving	progress	forward	and	 tru 	 ly 	 	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	so	that	people	like	nelson	and	his	 friend 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	to	 stud 	 y 	 	any	 long 	 er 	 	under	the	 street 	 light 	 s 	 	.	thank	you	.
