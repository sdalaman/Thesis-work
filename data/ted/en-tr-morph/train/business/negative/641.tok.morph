good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.	i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 grum 	 py 	 	eastern	european	,	i	was	 br 	 ought 	 	in	to	play	the	 pessim 	 ist 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.	so	bear	with	me	.
well	,	i	come	from	the	 form 	 er 	 	soviet	 re 	 public 	 	of	belarus	,	which	,	 a 	 s 	 	some	of	you	may	know	,	is	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	an	 oa 	 sis 	 	of	liberal	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
so	that	's	why	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	how	technology	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 shape 	 	and	open	up	 author 	 itarian 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	like	 our 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	 gradu 	 ating 	 	college	and	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 ideal 	 istic 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	join	the	ngo	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	using	new	media	to	promote	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	media	reform	in	much	of	the	 form 	 er 	 	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	to	my	surprise	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 dictator 	 ship 	 s 	 	do	not	 crumb 	 le 	 	so	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
in	fact	,	some	of	them	 actual 	 ly 	 	 surviv 	 ed 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	and	some	got	even	more	 repress 	 ive 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	i	ran	out	of	my	 ideal 	 ism 	 	and	 decide 	 d 	 	to	quit	my	ngo	job	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	how	the	 inter 	 net 	 	could	impede	 democrat 	 ization 	 	.
now	,	i	must	tell	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	never	a	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	argument	,	and	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	yet	with	some	of	you	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	.
it	was	never	popular	with	 man 	 y 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	who	 some 	 how 	 	thought	that	new	media	would	be	able	to	do	what	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 s 	 	could	n't	.
that	is	,	promote	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	difficult	 place 	 s 	 	where	 every 	 thing 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	think	by	2009	,	 th 	 is 	 	news	 ha 	 s 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	britain	,	so	i	should	 prob 	 ably 	 	add	gordon	 brow 	 n 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	list	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	there	is	an	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	argument	about	 logist 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	driven	so	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	debate	.	right	?
so	if	you	look	at	it	close	 en 	 ough 	 	,	you	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	that	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 economic 	 s 	 	.
the	 cyber 	 top 	 ians 	 	say	,	much	like	fax	 machine 	 s 	 	and	xerox	 machine 	 s 	 	did	in	the	'80s	,	 blog 	 s 	 	and	social	 network 	 s 	 	have	 radical 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	 economic 	 s 	 	of	protest	,	so	people	would	 inevit 	 ably 	 	rebel	.
to	put	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	the	assumption	so	far	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	if	you	give	people	 en 	 ough 	 	 connect 	 ivity 	 	,	if	you	give	them	 en 	 ough 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	 demo 	 cracy 	 	will	 inevit 	 ably 	 	follow	.
and	to	tell	you	the	truth	,	i	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	argument	,	in	part	 be 	 cause 	 	i	never	saw	three	american	 pre 	 sidents 	 	agree	on	 any 	 thing 	 	else	in	the	past	.
but	,	you	know	,	even	beyond	that	,	if	you	think	about	the	logic	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	it	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	call	ipod	 liberal 	 ism 	 	,	where	we	 assum 	 e 	 	that	every	single	iranian	or	chinese	who	 happen 	 s 	 	to	have	and	love	his	ipod	will	 al 	 so 	 	love	liberal	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	false	.
but	i	think	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	logic	--	that	we	should	be	dropping	ipods	not	 bomb 	 s 	 	--	i	mean	,	it	would	make	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	title	for	thomas	friedman	's	new	book	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 rare 	 ly 	 	a	good	sign	.	right	?
so	,	the	 big 	 ger 	 	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	logic	is	that	it	 con 	 fuse 	 s 	 	the	 intend 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	actual	uses	of	technology	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	think	that	new	media	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	could	 some 	 how 	 	help	us	 a 	 vert 	 	genocide	,	should	look	no	further	than	rwanda	,	where	in	the	'90s	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	two	radio	 station 	 s 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 fuel 	 ing 	 	much	of	the	ethnic	hatred	in	the	first	place	.
but	even	beyond	that	,	coming	back	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	what	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	is	that	certain	 government 	 s 	 	have	 master 	 ed 	 	the	use	of	 cyber 	 space 	 	for	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	.	right	?
and	they	are	building	what	i	call	the	spinternet	.
the	combination	of	spin	,	on	the	one	hand	,	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	on	the	other	.
so	 government 	 s 	 	from	russia	to	 chin 	 a 	 	to	iran	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hir 	 ing 	 	,	training	and	 pay 	 ing 	 	 blogger 	 s 	 	in	order	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 ideo 	 logical 	 	 comment 	 s 	 	and	create	a	lot	of	 ideo 	 logical 	 	blog	 post 	 s 	 	to	comment	on	sensitive	 politic 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.	right	?
so	you	may	wonder	,	why	on	earth	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	it	?
why	are	they	 engag 	 ing 	 	with	 cyber 	 space 	 	?
well	my	 theor 	 y 	 	is	that	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 censor 	 ship 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	less	effective	than	you	think	it	is	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
the	moment	you	put	 some 	 thing 	 	critical	in	a	blog	,	even	if	you	manage	to	ban	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	it	will	still	spread	around	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	other	 blog 	 s 	 	.
so	the	more	you	block	it	,	the	more	it	 emb 	 old 	 en 	 s 	 	people	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	avoid	the	 censor 	 ship 	 	and	thus	win	in	 th 	 is 	 	cat	-	and	-	mouse	game	.
so	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	control	 th 	 is 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	try	to	spin	it	and	 accus 	 e 	 	 any 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	written	 some 	 thing 	 	critical	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	cia	agent	.
and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	often	.
just	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
there	was	a	big	case	in	february	2009	 call 	 ed 	 	``	elude	the	cat	.	``
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	did	n't	know	,	i	'll	just	give	a	little	 summ 	 ary 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	that	a	24	-	year	-	old	man	,	a	chinese	man	,	 di 	 ed 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	 cus 	 to 	 dy 	 	.
and	police	 s 	 aid 	 	that	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	 play 	 ing 	 	hide	and	seek	,	which	is	``	elude	the	cat	``	in	chinese	 s 	 l 	 ang 	 	,	with	other	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	and	hit	his	head	against	the	wall	,	which	was	not	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	which	 s 	 at 	 	well	with	 man 	 y 	 	chinese	 blogger 	 s 	 	.
so	they	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	 post 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	critical	 comment 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	qq.com	,	which	is	a	popular	chinese	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	had	35,000	 comment 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	issue	 with 	 in 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	.
but	then	 author 	 ities 	 	did	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 pur 	 ge 	 	these	 comment 	 s 	 	,	they	 in 	 stead 	 	went	and	 reach 	 ed 	 	out	to	the	 blogger 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	 guy 	 s 	 	.	we	'd	like	you	to	 be 	 come 	 	 net 	 izen 	 	 invest 	 igator 	 s 	 	.	``
so	500	people	 appli 	 ed 	 	,	and	four	 we 	 re 	 	 select 	 ed 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	and	tour	the	 facil 	 ity 	 	in	question	,	and	thus	inspect	it	and	then	blog	about	it	.
 with 	 in 	 	 day 	 s 	 	the	entire	incident	was	 for 	 gotten 	 	,	which	would	have	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	if	they	 simpl 	 y 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	block	the	content	.
people	would	keep	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	for	 week 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	with	 an 	 other 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	about	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 author 	 itarian 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 cyber 	 space 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 politic 	 al 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	call	 author 	 itarian 	 	 de 	 liber 	 ation 	 	,	and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	when	 government 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reach 	 ing 	 	out	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 critic 	 s 	 	and	 lett 	 ing 	 	them	engage	with	each	other	 on 	 line 	 	.
we	tend	to	think	that	 some 	 how 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	harm	these	 dictator 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	but	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 strength 	 en 	 s 	 	them	.
and	you	may	wonder	why	.
i	'll	just	give	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	list	of	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 author 	 itarian 	 	 de 	 liber 	 ation 	 	may	 actual 	 ly 	 	help	the	 dictator 	 s 	 	.
and	first	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	simple	.
most	of	them	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	a	complete	information	vacuum	.
they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	data	they	need	in	order	to	identify	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 threat 	 s 	 	facing	the	regime	.
so	 encourag 	 ing 	 	people	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	 on 	 line 	 	and	share	information	and	data	on	 blog 	 s 	 	and	 wiki 	 s 	 	is	great	 be 	 cause 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	,	low	level	 appar 	 atchiks 	 	and	 bureaucrat 	 s 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	 conceal 	 ing 	 	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	country	,	right	?
so	from	 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 blog 	 s 	 	and	 wiki 	 s 	 	produce	knowledge	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	great	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	public	in	any	decision	making	is	 al 	 so 	 	great	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 help 	 s 	 	you	to	share	the	blame	for	the	 poli 	 cies 	 	which	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	fail	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	say	,	``	well	look	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	,	we	 consult 	 ed 	 	you	,	you	 vot 	 ed 	 	on	it	.
you	put	it	on	the	front	page	of	your	blog	.
well	,	great	.	you	are	the	one	who	is	to	blame	.	``
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	purpose	of	any	 author 	 itarian 	 	 de 	 liber 	 ation 	 	 effort 	 s 	 	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 leg 	 i 	 timacy 	 	of	the	 regime 	 s 	 	,	both	at	home	and	 a 	 broad 	 	.
so	 invit 	 ing 	 	people	to	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	public	 forum 	 s 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	them	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	decision	making	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	great	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	then	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	point	to	 th 	 is 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	and	say	,	``	well	,	we	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.	we	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	forum	.	``
just	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	one	of	the	russian	 region 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	now	 involve 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	in	 plan 	 ning 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	up	 un 	 til 	 	year	2020	.
right	?	so	they	can	go	 on 	 line 	 	and	 con 	 tribute 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	on	what	that	region	would	look	like	by	the	year	2020	.
i	mean	,	 any 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	russia	would	know	that	there	was	no	 plan 	 ning 	 	in	russia	for	the	next	month	.
so	 hav 	 ing 	 	people	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 plan 	 ning 	 	for	2020	is	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	going	to	change	 any 	 thing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 dictator 	 s 	 	are	still	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	control	the	agenda	.
just	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	iran	,	we	all	heard	about	the	twitter	revolution	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	,	but	if	you	look	close	 en 	 ough 	 	,	you	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 network 	 s 	 	and	 blog 	 s 	 	and	twitter	and	facebook	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 operation 	 al 	 	.
they	may	have	 be 	 come 	 	 s 	 lower 	 	,	but	the	 activist 	 s 	 	could	still	access	it	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 argu 	 e 	 	that	 hav 	 ing 	 	access	to	them	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	great	for	 man 	 y 	 	 author 	 itarian 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	great	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	can	gather	open	source	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
in	the	past	it	would	take	you	 week 	 s 	 	,	if	not	 month 	 s 	 	,	to	identify	how	iranian	 activist 	 s 	 	connect	to	each	other	.
now	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	how	they	connect	to	each	other	by	looking	at	 the 	 ir 	 	facebook	page	.
i	mean	kgb	,	and	not	just	kgb	,	used	to	torture	in	order	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 th 	 is 	 	data	.
now	it	's	all	 avail 	 able 	 	 on 	 line 	 	.
but	i	think	the	 big 	 gest 	 	conceptual	 pit 	 fall 	 	that	 cyber 	 top 	 ians 	 	made	is	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	digital	 native 	 s 	 	,	people	who	have	grown	up	 on 	 line 	 	.
we	often	hear	about	cyber	 activ 	 ism 	 	,	how	people	are	 get 	 ting 	 	more	active	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
 rare 	 ly 	 	hear	about	cyber	 hedon 	 ism 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	how	people	are	 be 	 coming 	 	 pass 	 ive 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 some 	 how 	 	 assum 	 e 	 	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	going	to	be	the	catalyst	of	change	that	will	push	young	people	 in 	 to 	 	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	while	in	fact	it	may	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	the	new	 op 	 ium 	 	for	the	 masse 	 s 	 	which	will	keep	the	same	people	in	 the 	 ir 	 	rooms	 download 	 ing 	 	 porn 	 ography 	 	.
that	's	not	an	option	 be 	 ing 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	too	 strong 	 ly 	 	.
so	for	every	digital	renegade	that	is	 revolt 	 ing 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	tehran	,	there	may	 a 	 s 	 	well	be	two	digital	 captiv 	 es 	 	who	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 rebel 	 ling 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	world	of	warcraft	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	realistic	.	and	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	about	it	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 great 	 ly 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	young	people	and	it	 play 	 s 	 	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	social	role	for	them	.
if	you	look	at	some	of	the	 survey 	 s 	 	on	how	the	young	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	benefit	from	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	you	'll	see	that	the	number	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	for	whom	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 broad 	 en 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	life	,	is	three	 time 	 s 	 	more	than	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 do 	 es 	 	play	a	social	role	,	 how 	 ever 	 	it	may	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	lead	to	 politic 	 al 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
so	the	way	i	tend	to	think	of	it	is	like	a	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	cyber	-	 need 	 s 	 	in	space	,	a	total	rip	-	off	from	abraham	maslow	.
but	the	point	here	is	that	when	we	get	the	remote	russian	village	 on 	 line 	 	,	what	will	get	people	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	not	going	to	be	the	 report 	 s 	 	from	human	 right 	 s 	 	watch	.
it	's	going	to	be	 porn 	 ography 	 	,	``	 s 	 ex 	 	and	the	city	,	``	or	 may 	 be 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	funny	 video 	 s 	 	of	 cat 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	have	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	.
so	what	should	we	do	about	it	?
well	i	say	we	have	to	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	number	of	ipods	per	capita	and	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	ways	in	which	we	can	empower	 intellectual 	 s 	 	,	 dis 	 sidents 	 	,	ngos	and	then	the	 member 	 s 	 	of	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	even	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	up	'	til	now	with	the	spinternet	and	 author 	 itarian 	 	 de 	 liber 	 ation 	 	,	there	is	a	great	chance	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	will	not	be	heard	.
so	i	think	we	should	shatter	some	of	our	 utopia 	 n 	 	 assumption 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
thank	you	.
