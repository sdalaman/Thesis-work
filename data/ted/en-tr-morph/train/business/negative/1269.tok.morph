i	 start 	 ed 	 	improv	 every 	 where 	 	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	new	york	city	with	an	interest	in	 act 	 ing 	 	and	 come 	 dy 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	new	to	the	city	,	i	did	n't	have	access	to	a	stage	,	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	create	my	own	in	public	 place 	 s 	 	.
so	the	first	project	we	're	going	to	take	a	look	at	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	no	pants	 sub 	 way 	 	ride	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	took	place	in	january	of	2002	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	woman	is	the	star	of	the	video	.
she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	she	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	.
she	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	with	a	 hid 	 den 	 	camera	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	6	train	in	new	york	city	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	stop	 a 	 long 	 	the	line	.
these	are	two	danish	 guy 	 s 	 	who	come	out	and	 s 	 it 	 	down	next	to	the	 hid 	 den 	 	camera	.
and	that	's	me	right	there	in	a	 brow 	 n 	 	coat	.
it	's	about	30	 degree 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	hat	.	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	 scar 	 f 	 	.
and	the	girl	's	going	to	notice	me	right	here	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	'll	see	now	,	i	'm	not	 wear 	 ing 	 	pants	.
so	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	--	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	she	's	 notice 	 d 	 	me	,	but	in	new	york	there	's	 weird 	 os 	 	on	any	 give 	 n 	 	train	car	.
one	person	's	not	that	 un 	 usual 	 	.
she	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	 read 	 ing 	 	her	book	,	which	is	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	titled	``	rape	.	``
so	she	's	 notice 	 d 	 	the	 un 	 usual 	 	thing	,	but	she	's	gone	back	to	her	normal	life	.
now	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	i	have	six	 friend 	 s 	 	who	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	at	the	next	six	 con 	 s 	 ecutive 	 	 stop 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 wear 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
they	're	going	to	be	 enter 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	car	one	by	one	.
we	'll	act	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	do	n't	know	each	other	.
and	we	'll	act	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	just	an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	we	've	made	,	 forget 	 ting 	 	our	pants	on	 th 	 is 	 	cold	january	day	.
so	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	she	 decide 	 s 	 	to	put	the	rape	book	away	.
and	she	 decide 	 s 	 	to	be	a	little	bit	more	aware	of	her	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
now	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	the	two	danish	 guy 	 s 	 	to	the	left	of	the	camera	,	they	're	 crack 	 ing 	 	up	.
they	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 funni 	 est 	 	thing	they	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
and	watch	her	make	eye	contact	with	them	right	about	now	.
and	i	love	that	moment	in	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	 be 	 cause 	 	before	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	 share 	 d 	 	experience	,	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	bit	 scar 	 y 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	at	 l 	 east 	 	 con 	 fusing 	 	to	her	.
and	then	once	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	 share 	 d 	 	experience	,	it	was	funny	and	 some 	 thing 	 	that	she	could	laugh	at	.
so	the	train	is	now	 pull 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	third	stop	 a 	 long 	 	the	6	line	.
so	the	video	wo	n't	show	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	on	for	 an 	 other 	 	four	 stop 	 s 	 	.
a	total	of	seven	 guy 	 s 	 	enter	 anonym 	 ously 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 wear 	 	.
at	the	eighth	stop	,	a	girl	came	in	with	a	giant	duffel	bag	and	 announce 	 d 	 	she	had	pants	for	sale	for	a	dollar	--	like	you	might	sell	 batt 	 eries 	 	or	 can 	 dy 	 	on	the	train	.
we	all	 ver 	 y 	 	matter	of	 fact 	 ly 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	a	pair	of	pants	,	put	them	on	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	thank	you	.	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	 need 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	``	and	then	 exit 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 reveal 	 ing 	 	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	and	went	in	all	different	 direction 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
so	that	's	a	still	from	the	video	there	.
and	i	love	that	girl	's	 re 	 action 	 	so	much	.
and	 watch 	 ing 	 	that	 video 	 tape 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	that	day	inspired	me	to	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	what	i	do	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	one	of	the	 point 	 s 	 	of	improv	 every 	 where 	 	is	to	cause	a	scene	in	a	public	place	that	is	a	positive	experience	for	other	people	.
it	's	a	 p 	 rank 	 	,	but	it	's	a	 p 	 rank 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	a	great	story	to	tell	.
and	her	 re 	 action 	 	inspired	me	to	do	a	second	annual	no	pants	 sub 	 way 	 	ride	.
and	we	've	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	every	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	january	,	we	did	the	10th	annual	no	pants	 sub 	 way 	 	ride	where	a	 divers 	 e 	 	group	of	3,500	people	 rod 	 e 	 	the	train	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 wear 	 	in	new	york	--	 al 	 most 	 	every	single	train	line	in	the	city	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	in	50	other	cities	around	the	world	,	people	 particip 	 ated 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	improv	class	at	the	 up 	 right 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	brigade	theater	and	 meet 	 ing 	 	other	creative	people	and	other	 perform 	 ers 	 	and	 comedian 	 s 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 mass 	 ing 	 	a	 mail 	 ing 	 	list	of	people	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	.
so	i	could	do	more	large	-	scale	 project 	 s 	 	.
well	one	day	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	through	 un 	 ion 	 	square	,	and	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	which	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	built	in	2005	.
and	there	was	a	girl	in	one	of	the	 window 	 s 	 	and	she	was	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	peculiar	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	dark	out	,	but	she	was	back	-	lit	with	 flor 	 escent 	 	 light 	 ing 	 	,	and	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 on 	 stage 	 	,	and	i	could	n't	figure	out	why	she	was	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
after	about	15	 second 	 s 	 	,	her	friend	 appear 	 ed 	 	--	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 hid 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	 dis 	 play 	 	--	and	they	 laugh 	 ed 	 	and	 hugg 	 ed 	 	each	other	and	ran	away	.
so	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	 may 	 be 	 	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 da 	 red 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	i	got	inspired	by	that	.
looking	at	the	entire	facade	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	70	total	 window 	 s 	 	--	and	i	 k 	 new 	 	what	i	had	to	do	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	 call 	 ed 	 	look	up	more	.	we	had	70	 act 	 ors 	 	dress	in	black	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 author 	 ized 	 	.
we	did	n't	let	the	 store 	 s 	 	know	we	 we 	 re 	 	coming	.
and	i	stood	in	the	park	giving	 signal 	 s 	 	.
the	first	signal	was	for	 every 	 body 	 	to	hold	up	these	four	-	foot	tall	 letter 	 s 	 	that	 spell 	 ed 	 	out	``	look	up	more	,	``	the	name	of	the	project	.
the	second	signal	was	for	 every 	 body 	 	to	do	 jump 	 ing 	 	 jack 	 s 	 	together	.
you	'll	see	that	start	right	here	.
and	then	we	had	 danc 	 ing 	 	.	we	had	 every 	 one 	 	dance	.
and	then	we	had	dance	 s 	 olo 	 s 	 	where	 on 	 ly 	 	one	person	would	dance	and	 every 	 body 	 	would	point	to	them	.
so	then	i	 g 	 ave 	 	a	new	hand	signal	,	which	 signal 	 ed 	 	the	next	 s 	 olo 	 ist 	 	down	 be 	 low 	 	in	 fore 	 ver 	 	21	,	and	he	 danc 	 ed 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	other	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
we	had	people	 jump 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	,	people	dropping	to	the	ground	.
and	i	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	just	 anonym 	 ously 	 	in	a	 sweat 	 shirt 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	my	hand	on	and	off	of	a	 trash 	 can 	 	to	signal	the	 advance 	 ment 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	in	 un 	 ion 	 	square	park	,	right	by	a	 sub 	 way 	 	station	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	by	the	end	who	 stop 	 ped 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	up	and	 watch 	 ed 	 	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	a	better	photo	of	it	.
so	that	 part 	 icular 	 	event	was	inspired	by	a	moment	that	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 tumble 	 	 up 	 on 	 	.
the	next	project	i	want	to	show	was	 give 	 n 	 	to	me	in	an	email	from	a	 strange 	 r 	 	.
a	high	school	kid	in	texas	wrote	me	in	2006	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	should	get	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	possible	to	put	on	blue	polo	 shirt 	 s 	 	and	 kh 	 aki 	 	pants	and	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	best	buy	and	stand	around	.	``
so	i	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	high	school	kid	back	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	are	correct	.
i	think	i	'll	try	to	do	that	 th 	 is 	 	 week 	 end 	 	.	thank	you	.	``
so	here	's	the	video	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	2005	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	best	buy	in	new	york	city	.
we	had	about	80	people	show	up	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	 enter 	 ing 	 	one	-	by	-	one	.
there	was	an	eight	year	-	old	girl	,	a	10	year	-	old	girl	.
there	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	65	year	-	old	man	who	 particip 	 ated 	 	.
so	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	group	of	people	.
and	i	told	people	,	``	do	n't	work	.	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	work	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	do	n't	shop	.
just	stand	around	and	do	n't	face	 product 	 s 	 	.	``
now	you	can	see	the	regular	 employ 	 ees 	 	by	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	have	the	yellow	 tag 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	shirt	.
 every 	 body 	 	else	is	one	of	our	 act 	 ors 	 	.
the	lower	level	 employ 	 ees 	 	thought	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	funny	.
and	in	fact	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	them	went	to	go	get	 the 	 ir 	 	camera	from	the	break	room	and	took	 photo 	 s 	 	with	us	.
a	lot	of	them	made	 joke 	 s 	 	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	us	to	go	to	the	back	to	get	heavy	 tele 	 vision 	 	 set 	 s 	 	for	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
the	 manage 	 rs 	 	and	the	security	 guard 	 s 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	did	not	find	it	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	funny	.
you	can	see	them	in	 th 	 is 	 	 foot 	 age 	 	.
they	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	either	a	yellow	shirt	or	a	black	shirt	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	 prob 	 ably 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	before	the	 manage 	 rs 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	dial	911	.
so	they	 start 	 ed 	 	running	around	 tell 	 ing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	the	 cop 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	,	watch	out	,	the	 cop 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	.
and	you	can	see	the	 cop 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 foot 	 age 	 	right	here	.
that	's	a	cop	 wear 	 ing 	 	black	right	there	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	with	a	 hid 	 den 	 	camera	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	the	police	had	to	inform	best	buy	management	that	it	was	not	,	in	fact	,	 il 	 legal 	 	to	wear	a	blue	polo	shirt	and	 kh 	 aki 	 	pants	.
thank	you	.
so	we	had	 be 	 en 	 	there	for	20	 minute 	 s 	 	;	we	 we 	 re 	 	happy	to	exit	the	store	.
one	thing	the	 manage 	 rs 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	was	to	track	down	our	 camera 	 s 	 	.
and	they	caught	a	couple	of	my	 guy 	 s 	 	who	had	 hid 	 den 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	in	duffel	 bag 	 s 	 	.
but	the	one	camera	guy	they	never	caught	was	the	guy	that	went	in	just	with	a	blank	tape	and	went	over	to	the	best	buy	camera	 depart 	 ment 	 	and	just	put	his	tape	in	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	and	 pretend 	 ed 	 	to	shop	.
so	i	like	that	 con 	 cept 	 	of	using	 the 	 ir 	 	own	technology	against	them	.
i	think	our	best	 project 	 s 	 	are	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 s 	 ite 	 	specific	and	happen	at	a	 part 	 icular 	 	place	for	a	reason	.
and	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	was	 rid 	 ing 	 	the	 sub 	 way 	 	.
i	had	to	make	a	transfer	at	the	53rd	st.	stop	where	there	are	these	two	giant	 escal 	 ators 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 depress 	 ing 	 	place	to	be	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 crowd 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	try	and	stage	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	make	it	 a 	 s 	 	happy	 a 	 s 	 	possible	for	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	in	the	winter	of	2009	--	8:30	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 morn 	 ing 	 	rush	hour	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	 out 	 side 	 	.
people	are	coming	in	from	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	,	 transfer 	 ring 	 	from	the	e	train	to	the	6	train	.
and	they	're	going	up	these	giant	 escal 	 ators 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	way	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
so	there	's	a	photograph	that	 illustr 	 ates 	 	it	a	little	bit	better	.
he	 g 	 ave 	 	2,000	high	 five 	 s 	 	that	day	,	and	he	 wash 	 ed 	 	his	 hand 	 s 	 	before	and	 after 	 ward 	 	and	did	not	get	sick	.
and	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	no	one	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	care	.
so	i	'd	say	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	one	of	the	most	common	 critic 	 ism 	 s 	 	i	see	of	improv	 every 	 where 	 	left	 anonym 	 ously 	 	on	youtube	 comment 	 s 	 	is	:	``	these	people	have	too	much	time	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.	``
and	you	know	,	not	 every 	 body 	 	's	going	to	like	 every 	 thing 	 	you	do	,	and	i	've	 certain 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	thick	skin	 thank 	 s 	 	to	 inter 	 net 	 	 comment 	 s 	 	,	but	that	one	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	have	too	much	time	on	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
the	 particip 	 ants 	 	at	improv	 every 	 where 	 	 event 	 s 	 	have	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	leisure	time	 a 	 s 	 	any	other	new	yorkers	,	they	just	 occasion 	 ally 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	it	in	an	 un 	 usual 	 	way	.
you	know	,	every	saturday	and	sunday	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	each	fall	gather	in	 foot 	 ball 	 	 stad 	 ium 	 s 	 	to	watch	 game 	 s 	 	.
and	i	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 body 	 	comment	,	looking	at	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	game	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	all	 t 	 hose 	 	people	in	the	 stand 	 s 	 	,	they	have	too	much	time	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.	``
and	of	course	they	do	n't	.
it	's	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	to	 s 	 pent 	 	a	 week 	 end 	 	afternoon	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	game	in	a	 stad 	 ium 	 	.
but	i	think	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	valid	way	to	 s 	 pend 	 	an	afternoon	freezing	in	place	with	200	people	in	the	grand	central	terminal	or	 dress 	 ing 	 	up	like	a	 ghost 	 buster 	 	and	running	through	the	new	york	public	library	.
or	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	same	mp	3	 a 	 s 	 	3,000	other	people	and	 danc 	 ing 	 	 silent 	 ly 	 	in	a	park	,	or	 burst 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	song	in	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	a	 spontane 	 ous 	 	musical	,	or	 div 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	in	coney	 is 	 land 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	 form 	 al 	 	attire	.
you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	we	're	taught	to	play	.
and	we	're	never	 give 	 n 	 	a	reason	why	we	should	play	.
it	's	just	 accept 	 able 	 	that	play	is	a	good	thing	.
and	i	think	that	's	sort	of	the	point	of	improv	 every 	 where 	 	.
it	's	that	there	is	no	point	and	that	there	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	a	point	.
we	do	n't	need	a	reason	.
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	it	's	going	to	be	a	funny	idea	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	the	people	who	witness	it	will	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	 f 	 un 	 	time	,	then	that	's	 en 	 ough 	 	for	us	.
and	i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	learn	that	there	's	no	right	or	wrong	way	to	play	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
