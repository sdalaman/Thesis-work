we	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	people	an	idea	of	what	they	can	do	about	it	.
we	focus	 prim 	 arily 	 	on	the	planet	's	environment	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	address	 issue 	 s 	 	of	global	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	 inter 	 national 	 	conflict	,	 respons 	 ible 	 	use	of	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	even	the	rise	of	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	second	 super 	 power 	 	and	much	,	much	more	.

it	's	no	 exagge 	 ration 	 	to	say	that	the	mobile	phone	may	be	among	the	world	's	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	it	's	possible	to	imagine	a	world	in	which	the	mobile	phone	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	far	more	than	a	medium	for	social	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
i	've	long	 admire 	 d 	 	the	witness	project	,	and	peter	gabriel	told	us	more	 detail 	 s 	 	about	it	on	wednesday	,	in	his	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	moving	 present 	 ation 	 	.
and	i	'm	just	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	happy	to	see	the	news	that	witness	is	going	to	be	 open 	 ing 	 	up	a	web	 port 	 al 	 	to	 en 	 able 	 	 user 	 s 	 	of	digital	 camera 	 s 	 	and	camera	 phone 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	over	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	hand	-	 carry 	 ing 	 	the	 video 	 tape 	 	.

now	,	imagine	a	similar	model	for	 network 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	.
imagine	a	web	 port 	 al 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	evidence	of	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	the	planet	:	 put 	 ting 	 	news	and	data	at	the	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	of	people	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	,	from	 activist 	 s 	 	and	 research 	 ers 	 	to	 business 	 people 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	.
it	would	 high 	 light 	 	the	 change 	 s 	 	that	are	 under 	 way 	 	,	but	would	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	give	voice	to	the	people	who	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	work	to	see	a	new	world	,	a	better	world	,	come	about	.
it	would	give	 every 	 day 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	a	chance	to	play	a	role	in	the	 protect 	 ion 	 	of	the	planet	.
it	would	be	,	in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	an	``	earth	witness	``	project	.
now	,	just	to	be	clear	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	talk	i	'm	using	the	name	``	earth	witness	``	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	scenario	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 short 	 hand 	 	,	for	what	 th 	 is 	 	 imagin 	 ary 	 	project	could	 aspir 	 e 	 	to	,	not	to	 piggy 	 back 	 	on	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	work	of	the	witness	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
it	could	just	 a 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	be	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	 environment 	 al 	 	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	project	,	``	``	smart	 mob 	 s 	 	for	natural	security	``	--	but	earth	witness	is	a	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	say	.
now	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	who	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	earth	witness	would	focus	on	 eco 	 logical 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	human	-	 caus 	 ed 	 	or	 other 	 wise 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 crime 	 s 	 	and	significant	 source 	 s 	 	of	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	and	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 understand 	 able 	 	and	 import 	 ant 	 	.
we	need	better	 document 	 ation 	 	of	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	the	planet	if	we	're	ever	going	to	have	a	chance	of	 repair 	 ing 	 	the	damage	.
but	the	earth	witness	project	would	n't	need	to	be	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	 problem 	 s 	 	.
in	the	best	worldchanging	tradition	,	it	might	 al 	 so 	 	serve	 a 	 s 	 	a	 show 	 case 	 	for	good	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 success 	 ful 	 	 project 	 s 	 	and	 effort 	 s 	 	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	that	deserve	much	more	 vis 	 ibility 	 	.
earth	witness	would	show	us	two	 world 	 s 	 	:	the	world	we	're	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	,	and	the	world	we	're	building	for	 generation 	 s 	 	to	come	.
and	what	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	scenario	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 appeal 	 ing 	 	to	me	is	we	could	do	it	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	key	 component 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
camera	 phone 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	would	be	fundamental	to	the	project	.
and	for	a	lot	of	us	,	they	're	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	yet	to	 al 	 ways 	 	-	on	,	 wide 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	information	 tool 	 s 	 	.
we	may	not	remember	to	 br 	 ing 	 	our	digital	 camera 	 s 	 	with	us	 where 	 ver 	 	we	go	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	few	of	us	forget	our	 phone 	 s 	 	.
you	could	even	imagine	a	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	scenario	in	which	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	build	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 phone 	 s 	 	.
over	the	course	of	last	year	,	open	-	source	 hard 	 ware 	 	 hack 	 ers 	 	have	come	up	with	 multi 	 ple 	 	 model 	 s 	 	for	 us 	 able 	 	,	linux	-	based	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	,	and	the	earth	phone	could	spin	off	from	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	project	.
at	the	other	end	of	the	network	,	there	'd	be	a	 serv 	 er 	 	for	people	to	 s 	 end 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	and	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	to	,	 access 	 ible 	 	over	the	web	,	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	a	photo	-	sharing	service	,	social	 network 	 ing 	 	 platform 	 s 	 	and	a	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 filter 	 ing 	 	system	.
now	,	you	web	2.0	 folk 	 s 	 	in	the	audience	know	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	but	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	for	whom	that	last	sentence	was	in	a	crazy	moon	language	,	i	mean	 simpl 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	 on 	 line 	 	part	of	the	earth	witness	project	would	be	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	 user 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	together	and	 work 	 ing 	 	 open 	 ly 	 	.
that	's	 en 	 ough 	 	right	there	to	start	to	build	a	 compel 	 ling 	 	 chronic 	 le 	 	of	what	's	now	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	our	planet	,	but	we	could	do	more	.
an	earth	witness	 s 	 ite 	 	could	 al 	 so 	 	serve	 a 	 s 	 	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	spot	for	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	data	about	 condition 	 s 	 	around	the	planet	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	by	 environment 	 al 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	that	attach	to	your	cell	phone	.
now	,	you	do	n't	see	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	add	-	ons	for	 phone 	 s 	 	yet	,	but	 student 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	around	the	world	have	 attach 	 ed 	 	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	to	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	and	 hand 	 held 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	and	cheap	 robot 	 s 	 	and	the	 back 	 s 	 	of	 pigeon 	 s 	 	--	that	 be 	 ing 	 	a	project	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 under 	 way 	 	right	now	at	u.c	.	irvine	,	using	bird	-	 mount 	 ed 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 measur 	 ing 	 	smog	-	 form 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
it	's	 hard 	 ly 	 	a	stretch	to	imagine	 put 	 ting 	 	the	same	thing	on	a	phone	carried	by	a	person	.
now	,	the	idea	of	 connect 	 ing 	 	a	sensor	to	your	phone	is	not	new	:	phone	-	makers	around	the	world	 off 	 er 	 	 phone 	 s 	 	that	sniff	for	bad	breath	,	or	tell	you	to	worry	about	too	much	 s 	 un 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	.

even	the	lawrence	livermore	national	 lab 	 s 	 	have	gotten	 in 	 to 	 	the	act	,	 design 	 ing 	 	a	prototype	phone	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	to	find	 dirt 	 y 	 	 bomb 	 s 	 	.
now	,	there	's	an	enormous	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 in 	 expensive 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	on	the	market	,	and	you	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	imagine	 some 	 one 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	together	a	phone	that	could	measure	temperature	,	co	2	or	 m 	 ethane 	 	 level 	 s 	 	,	the	presence	of	some	 bio 	 toxin 	 s 	 	--	 potential 	 ly 	 	,	in	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	h	5n1	 av 	 ian 	 	flu	virus	.
you	could	see	that	some	kind	of	system	like	 th 	 is 	 	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	fit	with	larry	 brilli 	 ant 	 	's	instedd	project	.
now	,	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	data	could	be	 tag 	 ged 	 	with	 geo 	 graphic 	 	information	and	 mash 	 ed 	 	up	with	 on 	 line 	 	 map 	 s 	 	for	easy	 view 	 ing 	 	and	analysis	.
and	that	's	worth	 not 	 ing 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	.

earth	witness	would	take	 th 	 is 	 	further	,	 link 	 ing 	 	what	you	see	with	what	 thousand 	 s 	 	or	 million 	 s 	 	of	other	people	see	around	the	world	.
it	's	kind	of	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	think	about	what	might	be	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	if	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	ever	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
we	'd	have	a	far	better	--	far	better	knowledge	of	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	our	planet	 environment 	 ally 	 	than	could	be	 gather 	 ed 	 	with	 satellite 	 s 	 	and	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	government	sensor	 net 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
it	would	be	a	 collabor 	 ative 	 	,	bottom	-	up	approach	to	 environment 	 al 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	and	 protect 	 ion 	 	,	able	to	respond	to	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	in	a	smart	 mob 	 s 	 	kind	of	way	--	and	if	you	need	 great 	 er 	 	sensor	density	,	just	have	more	people	show	up	.
and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	you	ca	n't	 ignor 	 e 	 	how	 import 	 ant 	 	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	are	to	global	youth	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	system	that	could	put	the	next	generation	at	the	front	lines	of	 gather 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	data	.

a	system	like	earth	witness	would	be	a	tool	for	all	of	us	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	 improve 	 ment 	 	of	our	knowledge	and	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	the	 improve 	 ment 	 	of	the	planet	 it 	 self 	 	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 suggest 	 ed 	 	at	the	 out 	 set 	 	,	there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	good	 idea 	 s 	 	out	there	,	so	why	have	i	 s 	 pent 	 	the	bulk	of	my	time	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	about	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	could	look	like	:	bottom	-	up	,	technology	-	enabled	global	 collabor 	 ation 	 	to	handle	the	 big 	 gest 	 	crisis	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 face 	 d 	 	.
we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	the	planet	,	but	we	ca	n't	do	it	 al 	 one 	 	--	we	need	each	other	.
 no 	 body 	 	's	going	to	fix	the	world	for	us	,	but	 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	making	use	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	and	human	 commun 	 ities 	 	 a 	 like 	 	,	we	might	just	be	able	to	fix	it	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	have	at	our	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	a	 corn 	 ucopia 	 	of	 compel 	 ling 	 	 model 	 s 	 	,	 power 	 ful 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	,	and	 innov 	 ative 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	that	can	make	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	our	planet	's	future	.
we	do	n't	need	to	wait	for	a	magic	bullet	to	 s 	 ave 	 	us	all	;	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	an	arsenal	of	 solution 	 s 	 	just	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	be	used	.
there	's	a	 stagger 	 ing 	 	array	of	 wonder 	 s 	 	out	there	,	 a 	 cross 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	 discipline 	 s 	 	,	all	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	the	same	thing	:	success	can	be	 our 	 s 	 	if	we	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	try	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	say	at	worldchanging	,	 an 	 other 	 	world	is	n't	just	possible	;	 an 	 other 	 	world	is	here	.
we	just	need	to	open	our	 eye 	 s 	 	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
