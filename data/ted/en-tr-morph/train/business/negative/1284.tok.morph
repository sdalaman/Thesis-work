i	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	am	one	of	the	two	billion	people	on	earth	who	live	in	cities	.
and	there	are	 day 	 s 	 	--	i	do	n't	know	about	the	rest	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	--	but	there	are	 day 	 s 	 	when	i	 palp 	 ably 	 	feel	how	much	i	 re 	 ly 	 	on	other	people	for	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 thing 	 	in	my	life	.
and	some	 day 	 s 	 	,	that	can	even	be	a	little	 scar 	 y 	 	.
but	what	i	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	how	that	same	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	social	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	harness	to	help	heal	some	of	our	 deep 	 est 	 	civic	 issue 	 s 	 	,	if	we	 app 	 ly 	 	open	source	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	read	an	article	by	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	writer	michael	pollan	in	which	he	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	growing	even	some	of	our	own	food	is	one	of	the	best	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	for	the	environment	.
now	at	the	time	that	i	was	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	was	the	middle	of	the	winter	and	i	 definite 	 ly 	 	did	not	have	room	for	a	lot	of	dirt	in	my	new	york	city	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
so	i	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	 will 	 ing 	 	to	settle	for	just	 read 	 ing 	 	the	next	wired	magazine	and	 find 	 ing 	 	out	how	the	 expert 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	figure	out	how	to	solve	all	these	 problem 	 s 	 	for	us	in	the	future	.
but	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	point	that	michael	pollan	was	making	in	 th 	 is 	 	article	--	was	it	's	 precise 	 ly 	 	when	we	hand	over	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 special 	 ists 	 	that	we	cause	the	kind	of	 mess 	 es 	 	that	we	see	with	the	food	system	.
so	,	i	happen	to	know	a	little	bit	from	my	own	work	about	how	nasa	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	using	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	to	explore	growing	food	in	space	.
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	optimal	 nutrition 	 al 	 	yield	by	running	a	kind	of	high	-	quality	liquid	 s 	 oil 	 	over	 plant 	 s 	 	'	root	 system 	 s 	 	.
now	to	a	 veget 	 able 	 	plant	,	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	about	 a 	 s 	 	foreign	 a 	 s 	 	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
but	i	can	 off 	 er 	 	some	natural	light	and	year	-	round	climate	control	.
fast	-	forward	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	:	we	now	have	window	 farm 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 vert 	 ical 	 	,	hydroponic	 platform 	 s 	 	for	food	-	growing	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	.
and	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	that	there	's	a	pump	at	the	bottom	,	which	 period 	 ically 	 	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	liquid	nutrient	solution	up	to	the	top	,	which	then	 trick 	 les 	 	down	through	 plant 	 s 	 	'	root	 system 	 s 	 	that	are	 suspend 	 ed 	 	in	clay	 pel 	 lets 	 	--	so	there	's	no	dirt	 involve 	 d 	 	.
now	light	and	temperature	vary	with	each	window	's	 micro 	 climate 	 	,	so	a	window	farm	 requir 	 es 	 	a	 farm 	 er 	 	,	and	she	must	decide	what	kind	of	 crop 	 s 	 	she	is	going	to	put	in	her	window	farm	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	she	is	going	to	feed	her	food	 organ 	 ically 	 	.
back	at	the	time	,	a	window	farm	was	no	more	than	a	 technical 	 ly 	 	complex	idea	that	was	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 test 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	be	an	open	project	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	is	one	of	the	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	 area 	 s 	 	of	 patent 	 ing 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	right	now	and	could	possibly	 be 	 come 	 	 an 	 other 	 	area	like	monsanto	,	where	we	have	a	lot	of	corporate	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	in	the	way	of	people	's	food	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	creating	a	product	,	what	i	was	going	to	do	was	open	 th 	 is 	 	up	to	a	whole	bunch	of	co	-	 develop 	 ers 	 	.
the	first	few	 system 	 s 	 	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	,	they	kind	of	 work 	 ed 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	able	to	grow	about	a	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	a	week	in	a	typical	new	york	city	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	window	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	grow	 cher 	 ry 	 	 tomato 	 es 	 	and	 cucumber 	 s 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
but	the	first	few	 system 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	these	 leak 	 y 	 	,	loud	power	-	guzzlers	that	martha	stewart	would	 definite 	 ly 	 	never	have	approved	.
so	to	 br 	 ing 	 	on	more	co	-	 develop 	 ers 	 	,	what	we	did	was	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	social	media	 s 	 ite 	 	on	which	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	the	 design 	 s 	 	,	we	 explain 	 ed 	 	how	they	 work 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	even	went	so	far	 a 	 s 	 	to	point	out	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	wrong	with	these	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	 invit 	 ed 	 	people	all	over	the	world	to	build	them	and	experiment	with	us	.
so	 actual 	 ly 	 	now	on	 th 	 is 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	we	have	18,000	people	.
and	we	have	window	 farm 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	.
what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	what	nasa	or	a	large	corporation	would	call	r	&	d	,	or	research	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
but	what	we	call	it	is	r	&	d	-	i	-	y	,	or	research	and	develop	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	jackson	came	 a 	 long 	 	and	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	we	use	air	 pump 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	water	 pump 	 s 	 	.
it	took	building	a	whole	bunch	of	 system 	 s 	 	to	get	it	right	,	but	once	we	did	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	cut	our	carbon	 foot 	 print 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	in	half	.
tony	in	chicago	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taking	on	growing	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	like	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	window	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	and	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	his	 straw 	 berries 	 	to	fruit	for	nine	 month 	 s 	 	of	the	year	in	low	-	light	 condition 	 s 	 	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	changing	out	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
and	window	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	finland	have	 be 	 en 	 	 custom 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	window	 farm 	 s 	 	for	the	dark	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	finnish	 winter 	 s 	 	by	 out 	 fitting 	 	them	with	led	grow	 light 	 s 	 	that	they	're	now	making	open	source	and	part	of	the	project	.
so	window	 farm 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	through	a	rapid	 version 	 ing 	 	process	similar	to	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
and	with	every	open	source	project	,	the	real	benefit	is	the	 inter 	 play 	 	between	the	specific	 concern 	 s 	 	of	people	 custom 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 system 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 part 	 icular 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	and	the	universal	 concern 	 s 	 	.
so	my	core	team	and	i	are	able	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	on	the	 improve 	 ments 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	benefit	 every 	 one 	 	.
and	we	're	able	to	look	out	for	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 new 	 com 	 ers 	 	.
so	for	do	-	it	-	yourselfers	,	we	provide	free	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	tested	 instruct 	 ions 	 	so	that	 any 	 one 	 	,	 any 	 where 	 	around	the	world	,	can	build	one	of	these	 system 	 s 	 	for	free	.
and	there	's	a	patent	 pend 	 ing 	 	on	these	 system 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	that	's	held	by	the	community	.
and	to	fund	the	project	,	we	partner	to	create	 product 	 s 	 	that	we	then	sell	to	 school 	 s 	 	and	to	 individual 	 s 	 	who	do	n't	have	time	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 system 	 s 	 	.
now	 with 	 in 	 	our	community	,	a	certain	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	.
in	our	culture	,	it	is	better	to	be	a	 test 	 er 	 	who	 support 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	idea	than	it	is	to	be	just	the	idea	guy	.
what	we	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	we	get	support	for	our	own	work	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	an	experience	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	in	a	way	other	than	just	 screw 	 ing 	 	in	new	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	that	eileen	 express 	 es 	 	best	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	the	actual	joy	of	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
so	she	 express 	 es 	 	here	what	it	's	like	to	see	 some 	 one 	 	 half 	 way 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	 hav 	 ing 	 	taken	your	idea	,	built	 up 	 on 	 	it	and	then	 acknowledg 	 ing 	 	you	for	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	.
if	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	see	the	kind	of	wide	consumer	behavior	change	that	we	're	all	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	and	food	people	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	just	need	to	 d 	 itch 	 	the	term	``	consumer	``	and	get	 be 	 hind 	 	the	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
open	source	 project 	 s 	 	tend	to	have	a	 moment 	 um 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
and	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	that	r	&	d	-	i	-	y	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	beyond	just	window	 farm 	 s 	 	and	leds	 in 	 to 	 	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	and	aquaponic	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	building	 up 	 on 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	of	 generation 	 s 	 	who	went	before	us	.
and	we	're	looking	 a 	 head 	 	at	 generation 	 s 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	need	us	to	 re 	 tool 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	now	.
so	we	ask	that	you	join	us	in	 re 	 discover 	 ing 	 	the	value	of	 citizen 	 s 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	,	and	to	declare	that	we	are	all	still	 pioneer 	 s 	 	.
