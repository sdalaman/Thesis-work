a	few	 word 	 s 	 	about	how	i	got	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	do	with	happiness	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
when	i	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	young	child	,	i	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 introvert 	 ed 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	much	to	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	,	kind	of	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 surviv 	 ing 	 	,	i	would	go	 in 	 to 	 	my	own	 ver 	 y 	 	personal	space	,	and	i	would	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	would	make	 thing 	 s 	 	for	people	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	,	you	know	,	giving	,	 show 	 ing 	 	them	my	love	.
i	would	go	 in 	 to 	 	these	private	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	i	would	put	my	 idea 	 s 	 	and	my	 pass 	 ions 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 object 	 s 	 	--	and	sort	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	speak	with	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	whole	activity	of	 work 	 ing 	 	with	my	 hand 	 s 	 	and	creating	 object 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	idea	realm	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	with	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	realm	.
and	the	 idea 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	disparate	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	 man 	 y 	 	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 piece 	 s 	 	,	and	there	's	no	real	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	one	or	the	other	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	they	sort	of	come	out	of	my	brain	,	and	they	're	all	different	sort	of	 thought 	 s 	 	that	are	 trigger 	 ed 	 	by	looking	at	life	,	and	 see 	 ing 	 	nature	and	 see 	 ing 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	and	just	 hav 	 ing 	 	kind	of	 play 	 ful 	 	random	 thought 	 s 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	.
when	i	was	a	child	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	explore	motion	.
i	fell	in	love	with	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	,	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	explore	motion	by	making	little	 flip 	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	that	i	did	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	like	when	i	was	around	 seven 	 th 	 	grade	,	and	i	remember	when	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	little	rock	there	,	and	the	 path 	 way 	 	of	the	 vehicle 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	would	fly	through	the	air	,	and	how	the	 character 	 s 	 	--	--	would	come	 shoot 	 ing 	 	out	of	the	car	,	so	,	on	my	mind	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	of	the	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	when	you	're	a	little	kid	,	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	end	with	 th 	 is 	 	--	--	gratuitous	violence	.
so	that	was	how	i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	to	explore	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	,	and	 express 	 ed 	 	it	.
now	,	when	i	went	to	college	,	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	making	 fair 	 ly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	fragile	 machine 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	came	about	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 interest 	 s 	 	.
when	i	was	in	high	school	,	i	 love 	 d 	 	to	program	 computer 	 s 	 	,	so	i	sort	of	 like 	 d 	 	the	logical	flow	of	 event 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	and	 be 	 coming 	 	a	surgeon	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 me 	 ant 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	my	 hand 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	focused	,	 intens 	 e 	 	way	.
so	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	art	 course 	 s 	 	,	and	i	found	a	way	to	make	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	that	 br 	 ought 	 	together	my	love	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	precise	with	my	 hand 	 s 	 	,	with	coming	up	with	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	logical	 flow 	 s 	 	of	energy	through	a	system	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	wire	--	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	did	was	both	a	visual	and	a	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	decision	at	the	same	time	.
so	,	i	was	able	to	sort	of	 exercis 	 e 	 	all	of	that	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	machine	is	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	get	to	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	full	of	 man 	 y 	 	little	trivial	end	 point 	 s 	 	,	like	there	's	a	little	foot	here	that	just	 drag 	 s 	 	around	in	 circle 	 s 	 	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	mean	 any 	 thing 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	just	for	the	sort	of	joy	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	 trivial 	 ity 	 	.
the	 connect 	 ion 	 	i	have	with	 engineer 	 ing 	 	is	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	any	other	engineer	,	in	that	i	love	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	.
i	love	to	figure	 thing 	 s 	 	out	,	but	the	end	result	of	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	.
that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	.
the	next	piece	that	is	going	to	come	up	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	kind	of	machine	that	is	 fair 	 ly 	 	complex	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	 my 	 self 	 	the	problem	.
since	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 lik 	 ing 	 	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	,	i	 g 	 ave 	 	 my 	 self 	 	the	problem	of	 turn 	 ing 	 	a	crank	in	one	direction	,	and	solving	all	of	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	for	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	man	to	walk	back	and	forth	.
so	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	did	n't	have	an	 over 	 all 	 	plan	for	the	machine	,	but	i	did	have	a	sense	of	the	 gest 	 ure 	 	,	and	a	sense	of	the	shape	and	how	it	would	occupy	space	.
and	then	it	was	a	matter	of	 start 	 ing 	 	from	one	point	and	sort	of	building	to	that	final	point	.
that	little	gear	there	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	back	and	forth	to	change	direction	.
and	that	's	a	little	found	object	.
so	a	lot	of	the	 piece 	 s 	 	that	i	've	made	,	they	involve	found	 object 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	--	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	 do 	 ing 	 	visual	 pun 	 s 	 	all	the	time	.
when	i	see	 object 	 s 	 	,	i	imagine	them	in	motion	.
i	imagine	what	can	be	 s 	 aid 	 	with	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	next	one	here	,	``	machine	with	 wish 	 bone 	 	,	``	it	came	about	from	 play 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 wish 	 bone 	 	after	 d 	 inner 	 	.
you	know	,	they	say	,	never	play	with	your	food	--	but	i	 al 	 ways 	 	play	with	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 wish 	 bone 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	it	's	kind	of	like	a	 cow 	 boy 	 	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	on	his	horse	for	too	long	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	make	him	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	the	table	,	and	i	thought	,	``	oh	,	i	can	make	a	little	machine	that	will	do	that	.	``
so	,	i	made	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	linked	it	up	,	and	the	 wish 	 bone 	 	 walk 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 wish 	 bone 	 	is	bone	--	it	's	animal	--	it	's	sort	of	a	point	where	i	think	we	can	enter	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	that	's	the	whole	piece	.
that	's	about	that	big	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	work	is	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	 puppet 	 ry 	 	,	where	the	found	object	is	,	in	a	sense	,	the	puppet	,	and	i	'm	the	 puppet 	 eer 	 	at	first	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 play 	 ing 	 	with	an	object	.
but	then	i	make	the	machine	,	which	is	sort	of	the	stand	-	in	for	me	,	and	it	is	able	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	action	that	i	want	.
the	next	piece	i	'll	show	you	is	a	much	more	conceptual	thought	,	and	it	's	a	little	piece	 call 	 ed 	 	``	cory	's	yellow	chair	.	``
i	had	 th 	 is 	 	image	in	my	mind	,	when	i	saw	my	son	's	little	chair	,	and	i	saw	it	explode	up	and	out	.
and	--	so	the	way	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	mind	at	first	,	was	that	the	 piece 	 s 	 	would	explode	up	and	out	with	infinite	speed	,	and	the	 piece 	 s 	 	would	move	far	out	,	and	then	they	would	begin	to	be	 pull 	 ed 	 	back	with	a	kind	of	a	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	feel	,	to	the	point	where	they	would	approach	infinite	speed	back	to	the	center	.
and	they	would	coalesce	for	just	a	moment	,	so	you	could	perceive	that	there	was	a	chair	there	.
for	me	,	it	's	kind	of	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	about	the	 fleet 	 ing 	 ness 	 	of	the	present	moment	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	express	that	.
now	,	the	machine	is	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	it	's	a	real	 ap 	 proxim 	 ation 	 	of	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	you	ca	n't	move	physical	matter	 infinite 	 ly 	 	with	infinite	speed	and	have	it	stop	 instantaneous 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	is	about	four	feet	wide	,	and	the	chair	 it 	 self 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	about	a	few	 inch 	 es 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	funny	sort	of	conceptual	thing	,	and	 yester 	 day 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	danny	hillis	'	``	10,000	year	clock	.	``
so	,	we	have	a	motor	here	on	the	left	,	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	through	a	gear	train	.
there	are	12	 pair 	 s 	 	of	50:1	 reduc 	 tions 	 	,	so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	final	speed	of	that	gear	on	the	end	is	so	 s 	 low 	 	that	it	would	take	two	trillion	 year 	 s 	 	to	turn	once	.
so	i	've	 invent 	 ed 	 	it	in	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	could	run	all	the	time	.
now	,	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	thought	.
i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 imagin 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	in	different	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
i	'm	 imagin 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	machine	.
what	would	i	love	?
i	would	love	to	be	 bath 	 ed 	 	in	oil	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	machine	 do 	 es 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	just	 bath 	 e 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	oil	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	just	sort	of	--	for	me	,	it	was	just	 re 	 ally 	 	about	the	 lusc 	 ious 	 ness 	 	of	oil	.
and	then	,	i	got	a	call	from	a	friend	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	show	of	 er 	 otic 	 	art	,	and	i	did	n't	have	any	 piece 	 s 	 	.
but	when	she	 suggest 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	the	show	,	 th 	 is 	 	piece	came	to	mind	.
so	,	it	's	sort	of	related	,	but	you	can	see	it	's	much	more	 over 	 t 	 ly 	 	 er 	 otic 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	i	call	``	machine	with	 gr 	 ease 	 	.	``
it	's	just	 continu 	 ally 	 	 ejacul 	 ating 	 	,	and	it	's	--	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	happy	machine	,	i	'll	tell	you	.
it	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	happy	.
from	an	 engineer 	 ing 	 	point	of	view	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	little	four	-	bar	 link 	 age 	 	.
and	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	found	object	,	a	little	fan	that	i	found	.
and	i	thought	,	what	about	the	 gest 	 ure 	 	of	 open 	 ing 	 	the	fan	,	and	how	 simpl 	 y 	 	could	i	state	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	,	in	a	case	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	clear	but	 al 	 so 	 	not	 suggest 	 ive 	 	of	any	 part 	 icular 	 	kind	of	animal	or	plant	.
for	me	,	the	process	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 invent 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	but	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 invent 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	to	make	 machine 	 s 	 	,	and	the	whole	thing	is	all	sort	of	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	wire	-	 bend 	 ing 	 	tool	.
after	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	 bend 	 ing 	 	 gear 	 s 	 	with	a	pair	of	 pli 	 ers 	 	,	i	made	that	tool	,	and	then	i	made	 th 	 is 	 	other	tool	for	sort	of	 center 	 ing 	 	 gear 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	--	sort	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	my	own	little	world	of	technology	.
my	life	 complete 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	when	i	found	a	spot	 weld 	 er 	 	.
and	that	was	that	tool	.
it	 complete 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	what	i	could	do	.
now	here	,	i	'm	going	to	do	a	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	job	of	silver	 s 	 old 	 er 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	way	they	teach	you	to	silver	 s 	 old 	 er 	 	when	you	're	in	school	.
i	just	like	,	throw	it	in	.
i	mean	,	real	 jewel 	 ers 	 	put	little	bits	of	 s 	 old 	 er 	 	in	.
so	,	that	's	a	 finish 	 ed 	 	gear	.
when	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	boston	,	i	 join 	 ed 	 	a	group	 call 	 ed 	 	the	world	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	 rac 	 ing 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	the	idea	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 pre 	 mise 	 	was	that	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	 piece 	 s 	 	of	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	on	the	street	,	and	there	'd	be	no	 subject 	 ive 	 	decision	about	what	was	the	best	.
it	would	be	--	 what 	 ever 	 	came	 a 	 cross 	 	the	finish	line	first	would	be	the	winner	.
so	i	made	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	first	 rac 	 ing 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	``	oh	,	i	'm	going	to	make	a	cart	,	and	i	'm	going	to	have	it	--	i	'm	going	to	have	my	hand	writing	'	 fast 	 er 	 	,	'	so	 a 	 s 	 	i	run	down	the	street	,	the	cart	's	going	to	talk	to	me	and	it	's	going	to	go	,	'	 fast 	 er 	 	,	 fast 	 er 	 	!	'	``	so	,	that	's	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
but	then	in	the	end	,	what	i	 decide 	 d 	 	was	every	time	you	finish	writing	the	word	,	i	would	stop	and	i	would	give	the	card	to	 some 	 body 	 	on	the	side	of	the	road	.
so	i	would	never	win	the	race	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 stop 	 ping 	 	.
but	i	had	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
now	,	i	 on 	 ly 	 	have	two	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	going	to	play	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	piece	that	,	for	me	,	is	in	some	ways	the	most	complete	kind	of	piece	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	was	a	kid	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	guitar	.
and	when	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	thought	,	i	was	 imagin 	 ing 	 	that	i	would	make	--	i	would	have	a	whole	machine	theater	 even 	 ing 	 	,	where	i	would	--	you	would	have	an	audience	,	the	 cur 	 tain 	 	would	open	,	and	you	'd	be	 entertain 	 ed 	 	by	 machine 	 s 	 	on	stage	.
so	,	i	 imagin 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 gest 	 ural 	 	dance	that	would	be	between	a	machine	and	just	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	chair	,	and	...
when	i	'm	making	these	 piece 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	a	point	where	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	at	the	same	time	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	.
and	i	think	there	's	a	point	between	 simpl 	 icity 	 	and	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	which	can	allow	a	 view 	 er 	 	to	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	take	 some 	 thing 	 	from	it	.
and	that	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	the	thought	that	all	of	these	 piece 	 s 	 	start	off	in	my	own	mind	,	in	my	heart	,	and	i	do	my	best	at	 find 	 ing 	 	ways	to	express	them	with	 material 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	a	struggle	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	i	manage	to	sort	of	get	 th 	 is 	 	thought	out	 in 	 to 	 	an	object	,	and	then	it	's	there	,	ok	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
the	object	 it 	 self 	 	just	 mean 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
once	it	's	 perceive 	 d 	 	,	and	 some 	 one 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	mind	,	then	there	's	a	cycle	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	.
and	to	me	,	that	's	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	 be 	 cause 	 	,	ever	since	 be 	 ing 	 	a	kid	,	i	've	 want 	 ed 	 	to	communicate	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	love	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	the	complete	cycle	of	coming	from	 in 	 side 	 	,	out	to	the	physical	,	to	 some 	 one 	 	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	i	'll	just	let	 th 	 is 	 	chair	come	down	.
thank	you	.
