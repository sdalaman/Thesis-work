i	'm	going	to	speak	 to 	 day 	 	about	the	relationship	between	science	and	human	 value 	 s 	 	.
now	,	it	's	 general 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	 question 	 s 	 	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	--	 question 	 s 	 	of	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	and	right	and	wrong	--	are	 question 	 s 	 	about	which	science	 official 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	no	opinion	.
it	's	thought	that	science	can	help	us	get	what	we	value	,	but	it	can	never	tell	us	what	we	ought	to	value	.
and	,	 con 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	,	most	people	--	i	think	most	people	 prob 	 ably 	 	here	--	think	that	science	will	never	answer	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 question 	 s 	 	in	human	life	:	 question 	 s 	 	like	,	``	what	is	worth	living	for	?	``
``	what	is	worth	 dy 	 ing 	 	for	?	``
``	what	 constitute 	 s 	 	a	good	life	?	``
so	,	i	'm	going	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	illusion	--	that	the	 separat 	 ion 	 	between	science	and	human	 value 	 s 	 	is	an	illusion	--	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	one	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
now	,	it	's	often	 s 	 aid 	 	that	science	can	not	give	us	a	 found 	 ation 	 	for	 moral 	 ity 	 	and	human	 value 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	science	 deal 	 s 	 	with	 fact 	 s 	 	,	and	 fact 	 s 	 	and	 value 	 s 	 	seem	to	belong	to	different	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
it	's	often	thought	that	there	's	no	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	way	the	world	is	that	can	tell	us	how	the	world	ought	to	be	.
but	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	 un 	 true 	 	.
 value 	 s 	 	are	a	certain	kind	of	fact	.
they	are	 fact 	 s 	 	about	the	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	conscious	 creature 	 s 	 	.
why	is	it	that	we	do	n't	have	 ethic 	 al 	 	 oblig 	 ations 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	?
why	do	n't	we	feel	 compass 	 ion 	 	for	 rock 	 s 	 	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	think	 rock 	 s 	 	can	suffer	.	and	if	we	're	more	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	our	fellow	 prim 	 ates 	 	than	we	are	about	 insect 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	we	are	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	they	're	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	a	 great 	 er 	 	range	of	potential	happiness	and	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	the	 cruci 	 al 	 	thing	to	notice	here	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	factual	claim	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	could	be	right	or	wrong	about	.	and	if	we	have	 mis 	 construe 	 d 	 	the	relationship	between	 bio 	 logical 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	experience	well	then	we	could	be	wrong	about	the	inner	 live 	 s 	 	of	 insect 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	no	 not 	 ion 	 	,	no	version	of	human	 moral 	 ity 	 	and	human	 value 	 s 	 	that	i	've	ever	come	 a 	 cross 	 	that	is	not	at	some	point	 reduc 	 ible 	 	to	a	concern	about	conscious	experience	and	 it 	 s 	 	possible	 change 	 s 	 	.
even	if	you	get	your	 value 	 s 	 	from	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	even	if	you	think	that	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 re 	 late 	 	to	 condition 	 s 	 	after	death	--	either	to	an	 et 	 ern 	 ity 	 	of	happiness	with	god	or	an	 et 	 ern 	 ity 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	in	hell	--	you	are	still	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 conscious 	 ness 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
and	to	say	that	 s 	 uch 	 	 change 	 s 	 	can	persist	after	death	is	 it 	 self 	 	a	factual	claim	,	which	,	of	course	,	may	or	may	not	be	true	.
now	,	to	speak	about	the	 condition 	 s 	 	of	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	life	,	for	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	we	know	that	there	is	a	 continu 	 um 	 	of	 s 	 uch 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	.
we	know	that	it	's	possible	to	live	in	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	state	,	where	 every 	 thing 	 	that	can	go	wrong	 do 	 es 	 	go	wrong	--	where	 mother 	 s 	 	can	not	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	where	 strange 	 rs 	 	can	not	find	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	 peace 	 ful 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	where	people	are	 murder 	 ed 	 	 in 	 discriminate 	 ly 	 	.
and	we	know	that	it	's	possible	to	move	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 continu 	 um 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	more	 idy 	 llic 	 	,	to	a	place	where	a	 con 	 ference 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	even	 conceiv 	 able 	 	.
and	we	know	--	we	know	--	that	there	are	right	and	wrong	 answer 	 s 	 	to	how	to	move	in	 th 	 is 	 	space	.
would	 add 	 ing 	 	cholera	to	the	water	be	a	good	idea	?
 prob 	 ably 	 	not	.
would	it	be	a	good	idea	for	 every 	 one 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 e 	 vil 	 	eye	,	so	that	when	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	them	they	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	blame	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	?	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	.
there	are	 truth 	 s 	 	to	be	known	about	how	human	 commun 	 ities 	 	flourish	,	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	we	understand	these	 truth 	 s 	 	.
and	 moral 	 ity 	 	 relat 	 es 	 	to	these	 truth 	 s 	 	.
so	,	in	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 value 	 s 	 	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 fact 	 s 	 	.
now	,	of	course	our	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	the	world	can	be	 under 	 stood 	 	at	 man 	 y 	 	 level 	 s 	 	--	from	the	level	of	the	genome	on	up	to	the	level	of	economic	 system 	 s 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 arrange 	 ments 	 	.
but	if	we	're	going	to	talk	about	human	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	we	are	,	of	 necess 	 ity 	 	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	human	brain	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	that	our	experience	of	the	world	and	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 with 	 in 	 	it	is	 real 	 ized 	 	in	the	brain	--	 what 	 ever 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	after	death	.
even	if	the	 su 	 icide 	 	 bomb 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	get	72	 virgin 	 s 	 	in	the	 after 	 life 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	life	,	his	 personal 	 ity 	 	--	his	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 personal 	 ity 	 	--	is	the	product	of	his	brain	.
so	the	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	of	culture	--	if	culture	 change 	 s 	 	us	,	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	it	 change 	 s 	 	us	by	changing	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 there 	 fore 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	cultural	 vari 	 ation 	 	there	is	in	how	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	flourish	can	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	principle	,	be	 under 	 stood 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	a	 matur 	 ing 	 	science	of	the	mind	--	 neuro 	 science 	 	,	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	etc	.
so	,	what	i	'm	 argu 	 ing 	 	is	that	value	's	 reduc 	 ed 	 	to	 fact 	 s 	 	--	to	 fact 	 s 	 	about	the	conscious	experience	of	conscious	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	 there 	 fore 	 	 visual 	 ize 	 	a	space	of	possible	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	experience	of	these	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	moral	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	with	 peak 	 s 	 	and	 val 	 ley 	 s 	 	that	correspond	to	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	the	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	conscious	 creature 	 s 	 	,	both	personal	and	 collect 	 ive 	 	.
and	one	thing	to	notice	is	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	are	 state 	 s 	 	of	human	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	that	we	 rare 	 ly 	 	access	,	that	few	people	access	.
and	these	await	our	 discover 	 y 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	of	these	 state 	 s 	 	can	be	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 mystic 	 al 	 	or	spiritual	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	are	other	 state 	 s 	 	that	we	ca	n't	access	 be 	 cause 	 	of	how	our	 mind 	 s 	 	are	 structure 	 d 	 	but	other	 mind 	 s 	 	possibly	could	access	them	.
now	,	let	me	be	clear	about	what	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	.	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	science	is	 guarantee 	 d 	 	to	map	 th 	 is 	 	space	,	or	that	we	will	have	scientific	 answer 	 s 	 	to	every	 conceiv 	 able 	 	moral	question	.
i	do	n't	think	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	that	you	will	one	day	consult	a	 super 	 computer 	 	to	learn	 whet 	 her 	 	you	should	have	a	second	child	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	we	should	bomb	iran	's	nuclear	 facil 	 ities 	 	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	you	can	deduct	the	full	cost	of	ted	 a 	 s 	 	a	business	expense	.
but	if	 question 	 s 	 	affect	human	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	then	they	do	have	 answer 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	we	can	find	them	.
and	just	 admit 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	just	 admit 	 ting 	 	that	there	are	right	and	wrong	 answer 	 s 	 	to	the	question	of	how	 human 	 s 	 	flourish	--	will	change	the	way	we	talk	about	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	and	will	change	our	 expect 	 ations 	 	of	human	 co 	 operation 	 	in	the	future	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	there	are	21	 state 	 s 	 	in	our	country	where	 corp 	 or 	 al 	 	 punish 	 ment 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	is	legal	,	where	it	is	legal	for	a	teacher	to	beat	a	child	with	a	 wood 	 en 	 	board	,	hard	,	and	raising	large	 bruis 	 es 	 	and	 bli 	 sters 	 	and	even	 break 	 ing 	 	the	skin	.
and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	children	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	are	 subject 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	every	year	.
the	 location 	 s 	 	of	these	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	 di 	 strict 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	will	fail	to	surprise	you	.
we	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	connecticut	.
and	the	 rational 	 e 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	is	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	religious	.
the	creator	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	told	us	not	to	spare	the	rod	,	 l 	 est 	 	we	spoil	the	child	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	proverbs	13	and	20	,	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	23	.
but	we	can	ask	the	obvious	question	:	is	it	a	good	idea	,	 general 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	to	subject	children	to	pain	and	violence	and	public	 humil 	 iation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 encourag 	 ing 	 	 health 	 y 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	good	behavior	?
is	there	any	doubt	that	 th 	 is 	 	question	 ha 	 s 	 	an	answer	,	and	that	it	 matter 	 s 	 	?
now	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	might	worry	that	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 un 	 defined 	 	,	and	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 perpetu 	 ally 	 	open	to	be	re	-	 construe 	 d 	 	.
and	so	,	how	 there 	 fore 	 	can	there	be	an	 object 	 ive 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	?
well	,	consider	by	 analog 	 y 	 	,	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	physical	health	.
the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	physical	health	is	 un 	 defined 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	just	heard	from	michael	 spect 	 er 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	statue	was	 carv 	 ed 	 	the	average	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	30	.
it	's	now	around	80	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	.
there	may	come	a	time	when	we	 meddl 	 e 	 	with	our	 genome 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	run	a	marathon	at	age	200	will	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	 dis 	 ability 	 	.
people	will	 s 	 end 	 	you	 don 	 ations 	 	when	you	're	in	that	condition	.
notice	that	the	fact	that	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	health	is	open	,	 genuine 	 ly 	 	open	for	 re 	 vision 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	not	make	it	 vac 	 uous 	 	.
the	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	a	 health 	 y 	 	person	and	a	dead	one	is	about	 a 	 s 	 	clear	and	 con 	 sequent 	 ial 	 	 a 	 s 	 	any	we	make	in	science	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	to	notice	is	there	may	be	 man 	 y 	 	 peak 	 s 	 	on	the	moral	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	:	there	may	be	 equi 	 valent 	 	ways	to	 thriv 	 e 	 	;	there	may	be	 equi 	 valent 	 	ways	to	organize	a	human	 socie 	 ty 	 	so	 a 	 s 	 	to	 maxim 	 ize 	 	human	 flourish 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	why	would	n't	 th 	 is 	 	 under 	 mine 	 	an	 object 	 ive 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	?
well	think	of	how	we	talk	about	food	:	i	would	never	be	 tempt 	 ed 	 	to	 argu 	 e 	 	to	you	that	there	must	be	one	right	food	to	eat	.
there	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	range	of	 material 	 s 	 	that	constitute	 health 	 y 	 	food	.
but	there	's	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	a	clear	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	food	and	poison	.
the	fact	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	right	 answer 	 s 	 	to	the	question	,	``	what	is	food	?	``
 do 	 es 	 	not	tempt	us	to	say	that	there	are	no	 truth 	 s 	 	to	be	known	about	human	nutrition	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	worry	that	a	universal	 moral 	 ity 	 	would	 requir 	 e 	 	moral	 pre 	 cept 	 s 	 	that	admit	of	no	 exception 	 s 	 	.
so	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	if	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	wrong	to	lie	,	it	must	 al 	 ways 	 	be	wrong	to	lie	,	and	if	you	can	find	an	exception	,	well	then	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	moral	truth	.
why	would	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	?
consider	,	by	 analog 	 y 	 	,	the	game	of	 ches 	 s 	 	.
now	,	if	you	're	going	to	play	good	 ches 	 s 	 	,	a	principle	like	,	``	do	n't	lose	your	 que 	 en 	 	,	``	is	 ver 	 y 	 	good	to	follow	.
but	it	 clear 	 ly 	 	 admit 	 s 	 	some	 exception 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 moment 	 s 	 	when	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	your	 que 	 en 	 	is	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	thing	to	do	.
there	are	 moment 	 s 	 	when	it	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	good	thing	you	can	do	.
and	yet	,	 ches 	 s 	 	is	a	domain	of	perfect	 object 	 ivity 	 	.
the	fact	that	there	are	 exception 	 s 	 	here	 do 	 es 	 	not	change	that	at	all	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	to	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 move 	 s 	 	that	people	are	apt	to	make	in	the	moral	sphere	.
consider	the	great	problem	of	women	's	bodies	:	what	to	do	about	them	?
well	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	thing	you	can	do	about	them	:	you	can	cover	them	up	.
now	,	it	is	the	position	,	 general 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	of	our	intellectual	community	that	while	we	may	not	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	might	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	wrong	``	in	boston	or	palo	 al 	 to 	 	,	who	are	we	to	say	that	the	proud	 den 	 izen 	 s 	 	of	an	ancient	culture	are	wrong	to	force	 the 	 ir 	 	wives	and	 daughter 	 s 	 	to	live	in	cloth	 bag 	 s 	 	?
and	who	are	we	to	say	,	even	,	that	they	're	wrong	to	beat	them	with	 length 	 s 	 	of	steel	cable	,	or	throw	 batt 	 ery 	 	acid	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	if	they	decline	the	privilege	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 mother 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	?
well	,	who	are	we	not	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	?
who	are	we	to	pretend	that	we	know	so	little	about	human	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	that	we	have	to	be	non	-	 judgment 	 al 	 	about	a	practice	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	voluntary	 wear 	 ing 	 	of	a	veil	--	women	should	be	able	to	wear	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 concern 	 ed 	 	.
but	what	 do 	 es 	 	voluntary	mean	in	a	community	where	,	when	a	girl	 get 	 s 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	,	her	father	's	first	impulse	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	often	,	is	to	murder	her	out	of	shame	?
just	let	that	fact	 de 	 ton 	 ate 	 	in	your	brain	for	a	minute	:	your	daughter	 get 	 s 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	,	and	what	you	want	to	do	is	kill	her	.
what	are	the	 chance 	 s 	 	that	 represent 	 s 	 	a	peak	of	human	 flourish 	 ing 	 	?
now	,	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	to	say	that	we	have	got	the	perfect	solution	in	our	own	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	's	like	to	go	to	a	 news 	 stand 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	 civil 	 ized 	 	world	.
now	,	 grant 	 ed 	 	,	for	 man 	 y 	 	men	it	may	 requir 	 e 	 	a	degree	in	 philosoph 	 y 	 	to	see	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	these	 image 	 s 	 	.
but	if	we	are	in	a	 reflect 	 ive 	 	mood	,	we	can	ask	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	the	perfect	 express 	 ion 	 	of	 psycho 	 logical 	 	balance	with	respect	to	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	like	youth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	women	's	bodies	?	``
i	mean	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	the	optimal	environment	in	which	to	raise	our	children	?
 prob 	 ably 	 	not	.	ok	,	so	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	's	some	place	on	the	spectrum	between	these	two	 extrem 	 es 	 	that	 represent 	 s 	 	a	place	of	better	balance	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 place 	 s 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	other	 change 	 s 	 	in	human	culture	there	may	be	 man 	 y 	 	 peak 	 s 	 	on	the	moral	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
but	the	thing	to	notice	is	that	there	will	be	 man 	 y 	 	more	ways	not	to	be	on	a	peak	.
now	the	 iron 	 y 	 	,	from	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	is	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	who	seem	to	 general 	 ly 	 	agree	with	me	and	who	think	that	there	are	right	and	wrong	 answer 	 s 	 	to	moral	 question 	 s 	 	are	religious	demagogues	of	one	form	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	of	course	they	think	they	have	right	 answer 	 s 	 	to	moral	 question 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	got	these	 answer 	 s 	 	from	a	voice	in	a	 whirl 	 wind 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	they	made	an	intelligent	analysis	of	the	 cause 	 s 	 	and	condition	of	human	and	animal	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	 endur 	 ance 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	lens	through	which	most	people	view	moral	 question 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	most	moral	talk	from	real	 question 	 s 	 	of	human	and	animal	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	we	 s 	 pend 	 	our	time	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 ga 	 y 	 	marriage	and	not	about	genocide	or	nuclear	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	or	poverty	or	any	other	 huge 	 ly 	 	 con 	 sequent 	 ial 	 	issue	.
but	the	demagogues	are	right	about	one	thing	:	we	need	a	universal	conception	of	human	 value 	 s 	 	.
now	,	what	 stand 	 s 	 	in	the	way	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	one	thing	to	notice	is	that	we	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	when	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 moral 	 ity 	 	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	secular	,	academic	,	scientist	 type 	 s 	 	.
when	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 moral 	 ity 	 	we	value	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	of	opinion	in	a	way	that	we	do	n't	in	any	other	area	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	the	dalai	lama	 get 	 s 	 	up	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	 medit 	 ating 	 	on	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	he	 think 	 s 	 	that	 help 	 ing 	 	other	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	is	an	 integ 	 ral 	 	component	of	human	happiness	.
on	the	other	hand	,	we	have	 some 	 one 	 	like	ted	bundy	;	ted	bundy	was	 ver 	 y 	 	fond	of	 abduct 	 ing 	 	and	 rap 	 ing 	 	and	 tor 	 tur 	 ing 	 	and	 kill 	 ing 	 	young	women	.
so	,	we	appear	to	have	a	genuine	 differ 	 ence 	 	of	opinion	about	how	to	 profit 	 ably 	 	use	one	's	time	.
most	western	 intellectual 	 s 	 	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	and	say	,	``	well	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	the	dalai	lama	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	right	about	--	 re 	 ally 	 	right	about	--	or	for	ted	bundy	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	wrong	about	that	 admit 	 s 	 	of	a	real	argument	that	 potential 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 pur 	 view 	 	of	science	.
he	 like 	 s 	 	chocolate	,	he	 like 	 s 	 	 van 	 illa 	 	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	one	should	be	able	to	say	to	the	other	that	should	 persuad 	 e 	 	the	other	.	``
notice	that	we	do	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	science	.
on	the	left	you	have	edward	witten	.
he	's	a	string	 theor 	 ist 	 	.
if	you	ask	the	 smart 	 est 	 	 physicist 	 s 	 	around	who	is	the	 smart 	 est 	 	physicist	around	,	in	my	experience	half	of	them	will	say	ed	witten	.
the	other	half	will	tell	you	they	do	n't	like	the	question	.
so	,	what	would	happen	if	i	 show 	 ed 	 	up	at	a	physics	 con 	 ference 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	string	 theor 	 y 	 	is	 bog 	 us 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 reson 	 ate 	 	with	me	.	it	's	not	how	i	chose	to	view	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	at	a	small	scale	.
i	'm	not	a	fan	.	``
well	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	would	happen	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	not	a	physicist	;	i	do	n't	understand	string	 theor 	 y 	 	.
i	'm	the	ted	bundy	of	string	 theor 	 y 	 	.
i	would	n't	want	to	belong	to	any	string	 theor 	 y 	 	club	that	would	have	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	member	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	point	.
 when 	 ever 	 	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 fact 	 s 	 	certain	 opinion 	 s 	 	must	be	 exclude 	 d 	 	.
that	is	what	it	is	to	have	a	domain	of	 expert 	 ise 	 	.
that	is	what	it	is	for	knowledge	to	count	.
how	have	we	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	in	the	moral	sphere	there	is	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	moral	 expert 	 ise 	 	,	or	moral	talent	,	or	moral	 gen 	 ius 	 	even	?
how	have	we	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	every	opinion	 ha 	 s 	 	to	count	?
how	have	we	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	every	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	a	point	of	view	on	these	 subject 	 s 	 	worth	 consider 	 ing 	 	?
 do 	 es 	 	the	taliban	have	a	point	of	view	on	physics	that	is	worth	 consider 	 ing 	 	?	no	.
how	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 ignor 	 ance 	 	any	less	obvious	on	the	subject	of	human	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	?
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	think	,	is	what	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	people	like	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	admit	that	there	are	right	and	wrong	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 question 	 s 	 	of	human	 flourish 	 ing 	 	,	and	 moral 	 ity 	 	 relat 	 es 	 	to	that	domain	of	 fact 	 s 	 	.
it	is	possible	for	 individual 	 s 	 	,	and	even	for	whole	 culture 	 s 	 	,	to	care	about	the	wrong	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	is	to	say	that	it	's	possible	for	them	to	have	 belief 	 s 	 	and	 desir 	 es 	 	that	 reli 	 ably 	 	lead	to	 needle 	 s 	 s 	 	human	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
just	 admit 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	will	transform	our	 dis 	 course 	 	about	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
we	live	in	a	world	in	which	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	between	 nation 	 s 	 	mean	less	and	less	,	and	they	will	one	day	mean	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
we	live	in	a	world	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 destruct 	 ive 	 	technology	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	technology	can	not	be	 un 	 invent 	 ed 	 	;	it	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	break	 thing 	 s 	 	than	to	fix	them	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 patent 	 ly 	 	obvious	that	we	can	no	more	respect	and	 toler 	 ate 	 	vast	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 not 	 ions 	 	of	human	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	than	we	can	respect	or	 toler 	 ate 	 	vast	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	the	 not 	 ions 	 	about	how	disease	 spread 	 s 	 	,	or	in	the	 safe 	 ty 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	of	 building 	 s 	 	and	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
we	 simpl 	 y 	 	must	 converg 	 e 	 	on	the	 answer 	 s 	 	we	give	to	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 question 	 s 	 	in	human	life	.
and	to	do	that	,	we	have	to	admit	that	these	 question 	 s 	 	have	 answer 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	so	,	some	 com 	 bust 	 ible 	 	material	there	.
 whet 	 her 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	or	people	 else 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	 hear 	 ing 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	may	well	be	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	-	with	-	rage	thing	,	after	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	some	of	them	.
language	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	here	.
when	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	veil	,	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	women	 dress 	 ed 	 	in	cloth	 bag 	 s 	 	.
i	've	lived	in	the	muslim	world	,	spoken	with	a	lot	of	muslim	women	.
and	some	of	them	would	say	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.	they	would	say	,	``	no	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 celebr 	 ation 	 	of	female	 special 	 ness 	 	,	it	 help 	 s 	 	build	that	and	it	's	a	result	of	the	fact	that	``	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 argu 	 ably 	 	a	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 psycho 	 logical 	 	view	--	``	that	male	lust	is	not	to	be	 trust 	 ed 	 	.	``
i	mean	,	can	you	engage	in	a	conversation	with	that	kind	of	woman	 with 	 out 	 	 seem 	 ing 	 	kind	of	cultural	 imperial 	 ist 	 	?
sam	harris	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	well	i	think	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 b 	 roach 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	sentence	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	clock	 tick 	 ing 	 	,	but	the	question	is	:	what	is	voluntary	in	a	 con 	 text 	 	where	men	have	certain	 expect 	 ations 	 	,	and	you	're	 guarantee 	 d 	 	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	in	a	certain	way	if	you	do	n't	veil	 your 	 self 	 	?
and	so	,	if	 any 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 want 	 ed 	 	to	wear	a	veil	,	or	a	 ver 	 y 	 	funny	hat	,	or	tattoo	 the 	 ir 	 	face	--	i	think	we	should	be	free	to	 volu 	 nt 	 arily 	 	do	 what 	 ever 	 	we	want	,	but	we	have	to	be	honest	about	the	 constraint 	 s 	 	that	these	women	are	 place 	 d 	 	under	.
and	so	i	think	we	should	n't	be	so	eager	to	 al 	 ways 	 	take	 the 	 ir 	 	word	for	it	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	it	's	120	 degree 	 s 	 	out	and	you	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	full	burqa	.
ca	:	a	lot	of	people	want	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	moral	progress	.
but	can	you	reconcile	that	?
i	think	i	 under 	 stood 	 	you	to	say	that	you	could	reconcile	that	with	a	world	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 be 	 come 	 	one	dimensional	,	where	we	all	have	to	think	the	same	.
paint	your	picture	of	what	 roll 	 ing 	 	the	clock	50	 year 	 s 	 	forward	,	100	 year 	 s 	 	forward	,	how	you	would	like	to	think	of	the	world	,	 balanc 	 ing 	 	moral	progress	with	 rich 	 ness 	 	.
sh	:	well	,	i	think	once	you	admit	that	we	are	on	the	path	 to 	 ward 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	our	 mind 	 s 	 	at	the	level	of	the	brain	in	some	 import 	 ant 	 	detail	,	then	you	have	to	admit	that	we	are	going	to	understand	all	of	the	positive	and	negative	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	much	 great 	 er 	 	detail	.
so	,	we	're	going	to	understand	positive	social	emotion	like	 empath 	 y 	 	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	we	're	going	to	understand	the	 factor 	 s 	 	that	 encourag 	 e 	 	it	--	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	genetic	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	how	people	talk	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	economic	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	 in 	 so 	 far 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	begin	to	shine	light	on	that	we	are	 inevit 	 ably 	 	going	to	 converg 	 e 	 	on	that	fact	space	.
so	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	not	going	to	be	up	for	 grab 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	going	to	be	like	 veil 	 ing 	 	my	daughter	from	birth	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	her	to	be	confident	and	well	-	educated	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	men	who	do	 desir 	 e 	 	women	.
i	mean	i	do	n't	think	we	need	an	nsf	grant	to	know	that	 com 	 puls 	 ory 	 	 veil 	 ing 	 	is	a	bad	idea	--	but	at	a	certain	point	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	 s 	 can 	 	the	 brain 	 s 	 	of	 every 	 one 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interrog 	 ate 	 	them	.
do	people	love	 the 	 ir 	 	 daughter 	 s 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	in	these	 system 	 s 	 	?
and	i	think	there	are	 clear 	 ly 	 	right	 answer 	 s 	 	to	that	.
ca	:	and	if	the	 result 	 s 	 	come	out	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	they	do	,	are	you	prepared	to	shift	your	 instinct 	 ive 	 	current	judgment	on	some	of	these	 issue 	 s 	 	?
sh	:	well	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 modul 	 o 	 	one	obvious	fact	,	that	you	can	love	 some 	 one 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	 delusion 	 al 	 	belief	system	.
so	,	you	can	say	like	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 k 	 new 	 	my	 ga 	 y 	 	son	was	going	to	go	to	hell	if	he	found	a	boyfriend	,	i	 chop 	 ped 	 	his	head	off	.	and	that	was	the	most	 com 	 passionate 	 	thing	i	could	do	.	``
if	you	get	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 part 	 s 	 	 align 	 ed 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	i	think	you	could	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	emotion	of	love	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	then	we	have	to	talk	about	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	 large 	 r 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
it	's	all	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	together	,	not	one	man	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ecstas 	 y 	 	and	then	 blow 	 ing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	up	on	a	bus	.
ca	:	sam	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	conversation	i	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	love	to	 continu 	 e 	 	for	 hour 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	that	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	 an 	 other 	 	time	.	thank	you	for	coming	to	ted	.
sh	:	 re 	 ally 	 	an	honor	.	thank	you	.
