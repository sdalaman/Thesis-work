i	'm	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.
and	i	would	like	to	tell	you	a	few	personal	 st 	 ories 	 	about	what	i	like	to	call	``	the	danger	of	the	single	story	.	``
i	grew	up	on	a	university	campus	in	eastern	nigeria	.
my	mother	 say 	 s 	 	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	at	the	age	of	two	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	think	four	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	close	to	the	truth	.
so	i	was	an	early	 read 	 er 	 	,	and	what	i	read	 we 	 re 	 	british	and	american	children	's	 book 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	an	early	writer	,	and	when	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	write	,	at	about	the	age	of	seven	,	 st 	 ories 	 	in	pencil	with	 cray 	 on 	 	 illustr 	 ations 	 	that	my	poor	mother	was	 oblig 	 ated 	 	to	read	,	i	wrote	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	i	was	 read 	 ing 	 	:	all	my	 character 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	white	and	blue	-	eyed	,	they	 play 	 ed 	 	in	the	snow	,	they	ate	 apple 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	the	weather	,	how	 love 	 ly 	 	it	was	that	the	 s 	 un 	 	had	come	out	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	i	lived	in	nigeria	.
i	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	 out 	 side 	 	nigeria	.
we	did	n't	have	snow	,	we	ate	 man 	 go 	 es 	 	,	and	we	never	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	weather	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	no	need	to	.
my	 character 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 d 	 rank 	 	a	lot	of	 ging 	 er 	 	beer	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 character 	 s 	 	in	the	british	 book 	 s 	 	i	read	 d 	 rank 	 	 ging 	 er 	 	beer	.
never	mind	that	i	had	no	idea	what	 ging 	 er 	 	beer	was	.
and	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	i	would	have	a	desperate	 desir 	 e 	 	to	taste	 ging 	 er 	 	beer	.
but	that	is	 an 	 other 	 	story	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	 demonst 	 rates 	 	,	i	think	,	is	how	 impression 	 able 	 	and	 vulner 	 able 	 	we	are	in	the	face	of	a	story	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	children	.
 be 	 cause 	 	all	i	had	read	 we 	 re 	 	 book 	 s 	 	in	which	 character 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	foreign	,	i	had	 be 	 come 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	 book 	 s 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	had	to	have	 foreign 	 ers 	 	in	them	and	had	to	be	about	 thing 	 s 	 	with	which	i	could	not	 personal 	 ly 	 	identify	.
 thing 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	when	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	african	 book 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	easy	to	find	 a 	 s 	 	the	foreign	 book 	 s 	 	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 writer 	 s 	 	like	chinua	achebe	and	camara	laye	i	went	through	a	mental	shift	in	my	 per 	 ception 	 	of	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	people	like	me	,	 girl 	 s 	 	with	skin	the	color	of	chocolate	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 kin 	 ky 	 	hair	could	not	form	 ponytail 	 s 	 	,	could	 al 	 so 	 	exist	in	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	write	about	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 recogn 	 ized 	 	.
now	,	i	 love 	 d 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	american	and	british	 book 	 s 	 	i	read	.
they	 stir 	 red 	 	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.	they	 open 	 ed 	 	up	new	 world 	 s 	 	for	me	.
but	the	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	was	that	i	did	not	know	that	people	like	me	could	exist	in	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
so	what	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	african	 writer 	 s 	 	did	for	me	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	it	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	me	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	single	story	of	what	 book 	 s 	 	are	.
i	come	from	a	 convention 	 al 	 	,	middle	-	class	nigerian	family	.
my	father	was	a	professor	.
my	mother	was	an	 administr 	 ator 	 	.
and	so	we	had	,	 a 	 s 	 	was	the	norm	,	live	-	in	domestic	help	,	who	would	often	come	from	 near 	 by 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	 village 	 s 	 	.
so	the	year	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	eight	we	got	a	new	house	boy	.
his	name	was	fide	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	my	mother	told	us	about	him	was	that	his	family	was	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	.
my	mother	 s 	 ent 	 	 y 	 am 	 s 	 	and	rice	,	and	our	old	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	to	his	family	.
and	when	i	did	n't	finish	my	 d 	 inner 	 	my	mother	would	say	,	``	finish	your	food	!	do	n't	you	know	?	people	like	fide	's	family	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	``
so	i	felt	enormous	 p 	 ity 	 	for	fide	's	family	.
then	one	saturday	we	went	to	his	village	to	visit	,	and	his	mother	 show 	 ed 	 	us	a	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 pattern 	 ed 	 	basket	made	of	 dy 	 ed 	 	raffia	that	his	brother	had	made	.
i	was	 start 	 led 	 	.
it	had	not	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	 any 	 body 	 	in	his	family	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	 some 	 thing 	 	.
all	i	had	heard	about	them	was	how	poor	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	so	that	it	had	 be 	 come 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	for	me	to	see	them	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	else	but	poor	.
 the 	 ir 	 	poverty	was	my	single	story	of	them	.
 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	thought	about	 th 	 is 	 	when	i	left	nigeria	to	go	to	university	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
i	was	19	.
my	american	 room 	 mate 	 	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	by	me	.
she	 ask 	 ed 	 	where	i	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	speak	english	so	well	,	and	was	 con 	 fused 	 	when	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	nigeria	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	have	english	 a 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	official	language	.
she	 ask 	 ed 	 	if	she	could	listen	to	what	she	 call 	 ed 	 	my	``	 trib 	 al 	 	music	,	``	and	was	 con 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	when	i	 produce 	 d 	 	my	tape	of	mariah	carey	.
she	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	i	did	not	know	how	to	use	a	stove	.
what	 s 	 truck 	 	me	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	she	had	felt	sorry	for	me	even	before	she	saw	me	.
her	default	position	 to 	 ward 	 	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	african	,	was	a	kind	of	 patron 	 izing 	 	,	well	-	meaning	 p 	 ity 	 	.
my	 room 	 mate 	 	had	a	single	story	of	africa	:	a	single	story	of	 catastroph 	 e 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	single	story	there	was	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	africans	 be 	 ing 	 	similar	to	her	in	any	way	,	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	more	complex	than	 p 	 ity 	 	,	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	human	 equal 	 s 	 	.
i	must	say	that	before	i	went	to	the	u.s.	i	did	n't	 conscious 	 ly 	 	identify	 a 	 s 	 	african	.
but	in	the	u.s.	 when 	 ever 	 	africa	came	up	people	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
never	mind	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	 place 	 s 	 	like	namibia	.
but	i	did	come	to	embrace	 th 	 is 	 	new	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	i	think	of	 my 	 self 	 	now	 a 	 s 	 	african	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	still	get	 quit 	 e 	 	 irrit 	 able 	 	when	africa	is	 refer 	 red 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	,	the	most	 re 	 cent 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	my	 other 	 wise 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	flight	from	lagos	two	 day 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	which	there	was	an	 announce 	 ment 	 	on	the	virgin	flight	about	the	 char 	 ity 	 	work	in	``	india	,	africa	and	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.	``
so	after	i	had	 s 	 pent 	 	some	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	 a 	 s 	 	an	african	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	understand	my	 room 	 mate 	 	's	 respons 	 e 	 	to	me	.
if	i	had	not	grown	up	in	nigeria	,	and	if	all	i	 k 	 new 	 	about	africa	 we 	 re 	 	from	popular	 image 	 s 	 	,	i	too	would	think	that	africa	was	a	place	of	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 fight 	 ing 	 	 sense 	 less 	 	 war 	 s 	 	,	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	poverty	and	 aid 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 able 	 	to	speak	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	a	kind	,	white	 foreign 	 er 	 	.
i	would	see	africans	in	the	same	way	that	i	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	had	 s 	 een 	 	fide	's	family	.
 th 	 is 	 	single	story	of	africa	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 come 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	from	western	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
now	,	here	is	a	quote	from	the	writing	of	a	london	 merchan 	 t 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	john	locke	,	who	 s 	 ailed 	 	to	west	africa	in	1561	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	account	of	his	voyage	.
after	 refer 	 ring 	 	to	the	black	africans	 a 	 s 	 	``	 beast 	 s 	 	who	have	no	 house 	 s 	 	,	``	he	 write 	 s 	 	,	``	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	people	 with 	 out 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mouth	and	 eye 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 breast 	 s 	 	.	``
now	,	i	've	 laugh 	 ed 	 	every	time	i	've	read	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	one	must	admire	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	of	john	locke	.
but	what	is	 import 	 ant 	 	about	his	writing	is	that	it	 represent 	 s 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	a	tradition	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	african	 st 	 ories 	 	in	the	west	:	a	tradition	of	sub	-	saharan	africa	 a 	 s 	 	a	place	of	 negative 	 s 	 	,	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	of	people	who	,	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	poet	are	``	half	devil	,	half	child	.	``
and	so	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	my	american	 room 	 mate 	 	must	have	 through 	 out 	 	her	life	 s 	 een 	 	and	heard	different	 version 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	single	story	,	 a 	 s 	 	had	a	professor	,	who	once	told	me	that	my	novel	was	not	``	 authentic 	 ally 	 	african	.	``
now	,	i	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 tend 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	with	the	novel	,	that	it	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	in	a	number	of	 place 	 s 	 	,	but	i	had	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 imagin 	 ed 	 	that	it	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	at	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	african	 authentic 	 ity 	 	.
in	fact	i	did	not	know	what	african	 authentic 	 ity 	 	was	.
the	professor	told	me	that	my	 character 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	too	much	like	him	,	an	educated	and	middle	-	class	man	.
my	 character 	 s 	 	drove	 car 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 starv 	 ing 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 authentic 	 ally 	 	african	.
but	i	must	 quick 	 ly 	 	add	that	i	too	am	just	 a 	 s 	 	 guilt 	 y 	 	in	the	question	of	the	single	story	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	mexico	from	the	u.s	.
the	 politic 	 al 	 	climate	in	the	u.s.	at	the	time	was	tense	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 debate 	 s 	 	going	on	about	 im 	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	often	 happen 	 s 	 	in	america	,	 im 	 migr 	 ation 	 	 be 	 came 	 	synonymous	with	mexicans	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 end 	 less 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	of	mexicans	 a 	 s 	 	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 flee 	 c 	 ing 	 	the	 health 	 care 	 	system	,	 sneak 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	border	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 arrest 	 ed 	 	at	the	border	,	that	sort	of	thing	.
i	remember	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	on	my	first	day	in	guadalajara	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	people	going	to	work	,	 roll 	 ing 	 	up	 tort 	 illa 	 s 	 	in	the	 market 	 place 	 	,	 smok 	 ing 	 	,	 laugh 	 ing 	 	.
i	remember	first	 feel 	 ing 	 	 s 	 light 	 	surprise	.
and	then	i	was	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	with	shame	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	so	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	the	media	 cover 	 age 	 	of	mexicans	that	they	had	 be 	 come 	 	one	thing	in	my	mind	,	the	 ab 	 ject 	 	 im 	 migrant 	 	.
i	had	 b 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	single	story	of	mexicans	and	i	could	not	have	 be 	 en 	 	more	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	of	 my 	 self 	 	.
so	that	is	how	to	create	a	single	story	,	show	a	people	 a 	 s 	 	one	thing	,	 a 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	thing	,	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	that	is	what	they	 be 	 come 	 	.
it	is	 im 	 possible 	 	to	talk	about	the	single	story	 with 	 out 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	power	.
there	is	a	word	,	an	igbo	word	,	that	i	think	about	 when 	 ever 	 	i	think	about	the	power	 structure 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	and	it	is	``	 nk 	 ali 	 	.	``
it	's	a	 no 	 un 	 	that	 loose 	 ly 	 	 transl 	 ates 	 	to	``	to	be	 great 	 er 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	.	``
like	our	economic	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 world 	 s 	 	,	 st 	 ories 	 	too	are	defined	by	the	principle	of	 nk 	 ali 	 	:	how	they	are	told	,	who	 tell 	 s 	 	them	,	when	they	're	told	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	are	told	,	are	 re 	 ally 	 	dependent	on	power	.
power	is	the	ability	not	just	to	tell	the	story	of	 an 	 other 	 	person	,	but	to	make	it	the	definitive	story	of	that	person	.
the	palestinian	poet	mourid	barghouti	 write 	 s 	 	that	if	you	want	to	 dis 	 possess 	 	a	people	,	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	way	to	do	it	is	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	story	and	to	start	with	,	``	 second 	 ly 	 	.	``
start	the	story	with	the	 arrow 	 s 	 	of	the	native	americans	,	and	not	with	the	 arriv 	 al 	 	of	the	british	,	and	you	have	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	story	.
start	the	story	with	the	failure	of	the	african	state	,	and	not	with	the	colonial	creation	of	the	african	state	,	and	you	have	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	story	.
i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	spoke	at	a	university	where	a	student	told	me	that	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	shame	that	nigerian	men	 we 	 re 	 	physical	 abuse 	 rs 	 	like	the	father	character	in	my	novel	.
i	told	him	that	i	had	just	read	a	novel	 call 	 ed 	 	american	psycho	--	--	and	that	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	shame	that	young	americans	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 erial 	 	 murder 	 ers 	 	.
now	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	fit	of	mild	 irrit 	 ation 	 	.
but	it	would	never	have	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	to	think	that	just	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	read	a	novel	in	which	a	character	was	a	 s 	 erial 	 	killer	that	he	was	 some 	 how 	 	 represent 	 ative 	 	of	all	americans	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	a	better	person	than	that	student	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	america	's	cultural	and	economic	power	,	i	had	 man 	 y 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	of	america	.
i	had	read	tyler	and	updike	and	steinbeck	and	gaitskill	.
i	did	not	have	a	single	story	of	america	.
when	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	 writer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	have	had	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	 child 	 hood 	 s 	 	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	how	i	could	invent	 horr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	my	 parent 	 s 	 	had	 d 	 one 	 	to	me	.
but	the	truth	is	that	i	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	 child 	 hood 	 	,	full	of	laughter	and	love	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	close	-	knit	family	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	had	 grand 	 father 	 s 	 	who	 di 	 ed 	 	in	 refuge 	 e 	 	 camp 	 s 	 	.
my	cousin	polle	 di 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	could	not	get	 ad 	 equate 	 	 health 	 care 	 	.
one	of	my	 close 	 st 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	okoloma	,	 di 	 ed 	 	in	a	plane	crash	 be 	 cause 	 	our	fire	 truck 	 s 	 	did	not	have	water	.
i	grew	up	under	 repress 	 ive 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	 government 	 s 	 	that	 d 	 evalu 	 ed 	 	education	,	so	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	paid	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 al 	 aries 	 	.
and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	i	saw	jam	disappear	from	the	 break 	 fast 	 	table	,	then	 mar 	 gar 	 ine 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	then	bread	 be 	 came 	 	too	expensive	,	then	milk	 be 	 came 	 	 ration 	 ed 	 	.
and	most	of	all	,	a	kind	of	 normal 	 ized 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	fear	 invad 	 ed 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
all	of	these	 st 	 ories 	 	make	me	who	i	am	.
but	to	insist	on	 on 	 ly 	 	these	negative	 st 	 ories 	 	is	to	flatten	my	experience	and	to	overlook	the	 man 	 y 	 	other	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 form 	 ed 	 	me	.
the	single	story	 create 	 s 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	,	and	the	problem	with	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	is	not	that	they	are	 un 	 true 	 	,	but	that	they	are	 in 	 complete 	 	.
they	make	one	story	 be 	 come 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	story	.
of	course	,	africa	is	a	continent	full	of	 catastroph 	 es 	 	:	there	are	immense	 one 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 horr 	 ific 	 	 rape 	 s 	 	in	congo	and	 depress 	 ing 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	fact	that	5,000	people	 app 	 ly 	 	for	one	job	 vac 	 ancy 	 	in	nigeria	.
but	there	are	other	 st 	 ories 	 	that	are	not	about	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	and	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	it	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	to	talk	about	them	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	that	it	is	 im 	 possible 	 	to	engage	 proper 	 ly 	 	with	a	place	or	a	person	 with 	 out 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	with	all	of	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	that	place	and	that	person	.

i	would	like	to	end	with	 th 	 is 	 	thought	:	that	when	we	reject	the	single	story	,	when	we	 real 	 ize 	 	that	there	is	never	a	single	story	about	any	place	,	we	regain	a	kind	of	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	.
