information	technology	 grow 	 s 	 	in	an	exponential	manner	.
it	's	not	linear	.	and	our	 intuit 	 ion 	 	is	linear	.
when	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	through	the	savanna	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	made	linear	 predict 	 ions 	 	where	that	animal	would	be	,	and	that	 work 	 ed 	 	fine	.	it	's	 hard 	 wired 	 	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
but	the	pace	of	exponential	growth	is	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	information	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
and	it	's	not	just	computation	.
there	is	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	linear	and	exponential	growth	.
if	i	take	30	 step 	 s 	 	 linear 	 ly 	 	--	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	--	i	get	to	30	.
if	i	take	30	 step 	 s 	 	 exponential 	 ly 	 	--	two	,	four	,	eight	,	16	--	i	get	to	a	billion	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	information	technology	.
when	i	was	a	student	at	mit	,	we	all	 share 	 d 	 	one	computer	that	took	up	a	whole	building	.
the	computer	in	your	 cell 	 phone 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	million	 time 	 s 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	,	a	million	 time 	 s 	 	 small 	 er 	 	,	a	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	.
that	's	a	billion	-	fold	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 cap 	 ability 	 	per	dollar	that	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	since	i	was	a	student	.
and	we	're	going	to	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	in	the	next	25	 year 	 s 	 	.
information	technology	 progress 	 es 	 	through	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	s	-	 curv 	 es 	 	where	each	one	is	a	different	paradigm	.
so	people	say	,	``	what	's	going	to	happen	when	moore	's	law	 come 	 s 	 	to	an	end	?	``
which	will	happen	around	2020	.
we	'll	then	go	to	the	next	paradigm	.
and	moore	's	law	was	not	the	first	paradigm	to	 br 	 ing 	 	exponential	growth	to	computing	.
the	exponential	growth	of	computing	 start 	 ed 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	before	gordon	moore	was	even	born	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	 app 	 ly 	 	to	computation	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	any	technology	where	we	can	measure	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	information	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
here	we	have	49	famous	 computer 	 s 	 	.	i	put	them	in	a	 log 	 arithmic 	 	graph	.
the	 log 	 arithmic 	 	scale	 hide 	 s 	 	the	scale	of	the	 in 	 crease 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	 trillion 	 s 	 	-	fold	 in 	 crease 	 	since	the	1890	census	.
in	1950s	they	 we 	 re 	 	 shrink 	 ing 	 	vacuum	 tube 	 s 	 	,	making	them	 small 	 er 	 	and	 small 	 er 	 	.	they	 final 	 ly 	 	hit	a	wall	;	they	could	n't	shrink	the	vacuum	tube	any	more	and	keep	the	vacuum	.
and	that	was	the	end	of	the	 shrink 	 ing 	 	of	vacuum	 tube 	 s 	 	,	but	it	was	not	the	end	of	the	exponential	growth	of	computing	.
we	went	to	the	fourth	paradigm	,	 transistor 	 s 	 	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	 integrate 	 d 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	.
when	that	 come 	 s 	 	to	an	end	we	'll	go	to	the	sixth	paradigm	;	three	-	dimensional	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	.
but	what	's	even	more	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	than	 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	scale	of	progress	,	is	that	--	look	at	how	 predict 	 able 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
i	mean	 th 	 is 	 	went	through	thick	and	thin	,	through	war	and	peace	,	through	boom	 time 	 s 	 	and	 recess 	 ions 	 	.
the	great	 depress 	 ion 	 	made	not	a	dent	in	 th 	 is 	 	exponential	 progress 	 ion 	 	.
we	'll	see	the	same	thing	in	the	economic	 recess 	 ion 	 	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	now	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	the	exponential	growth	of	information	technology	 cap 	 ability 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	 un 	 ab 	 ated 	 	.
and	i	just	 update 	 d 	 	these	 graph 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	them	through	2002	in	my	book	,	``	the	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	is	near	.	``
so	we	 update 	 d 	 	them	,	so	i	could	present	it	here	,	to	2007	.
and	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	well	are	n't	you	nervous	?
 may 	 be 	 	it	kind	of	did	n't	stay	on	 th 	 is 	 	exponential	 progress 	 ion 	 	.	``
i	was	a	little	nervous	 be 	 cause 	 	 may 	 be 	 	the	data	would	n't	be	right	,	but	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	now	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	exponential	 progress 	 ion 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	graph	here	.	you	could	buy	one	transistor	for	a	dollar	in	1968	.
you	can	buy	half	a	billion	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	better	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 fast 	 er 	 	.
but	look	at	how	 predict 	 able 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
and	i	'd	say	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	is	over	-	fitting	to	past	data	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	making	these	forward	-	looking	 predict 	 ions 	 	for	about	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	the	cost	of	a	transistor	cycle	,	which	is	a	measure	of	the	price	performance	of	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	down	about	every	year	.
that	's	a	50	percent	 defl 	 ation 	 	rate	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	true	of	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	like	dna	data	or	brain	data	.
but	we	more	than	make	up	for	that	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	ship	more	than	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	every	form	of	information	technology	.
we	've	had	18	percent	growth	in	constant	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	every	form	of	information	technology	for	the	last	half	-	century	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	you	can	get	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	it	each	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	moore	's	law	.
the	amount	of	dna	data	we	've	 sequence 	 d 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 double 	 d 	 	every	year	.
the	cost	 ha 	 s 	 	come	down	by	half	every	year	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	smooth	 progress 	 ion 	 	since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	genome	project	.
and	 half 	 way 	 	through	the	project	,	 skeptic 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 work 	 ing 	 	out	.	you	're	 half 	 way 	 	through	the	genome	project	and	you	've	 finish 	 ed 	 	one	percent	of	the	project	.	``
but	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	right	on	schedule	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	double	one	percent	seven	more	 time 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	you	get	100	percent	.	and	the	project	was	 finish 	 ed 	 	on	time	.

but	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 progress 	 ed 	 	at	an	exponential	pace	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 deep 	 ly 	 	 democrat 	 izing 	 	.

and	we	will	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	computation	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	through	the	21st	century	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 simul 	 ate 	 	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	human	brain	.
but	where	will	we	get	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	?
some	 critic 	 s 	 	say	,	``	oh	,	well	 soft 	 ware 	 	is	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	the	mud	.	``
but	we	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	about	the	human	brain	.
spatial	 re 	 solution 	 	of	brain	 s 	 canning 	 	is	 doub 	 ling 	 	every	year	.
the	amount	of	data	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	about	the	brain	is	 doub 	 ling 	 	every	year	.
and	we	're	 show 	 ing 	 	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	turn	 th 	 is 	 	data	 in 	 to 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 model 	 s 	 	and	 simul 	 ations 	 	of	brain	 region 	 s 	 	.
there	is	about	20	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 model 	 ed 	 	,	 simul 	 ated 	 	and	tested	:	the	 audit 	 ory 	 	cortex	,	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	visual	cortex	;	 ce 	 rebel 	 lum 	 	,	where	we	do	our	skill	 form 	 ation 	 	;	 slice 	 s 	 	of	the	cerebral	cortex	,	where	we	do	our	rational	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 fuel 	 ed 	 	an	 in 	 crease 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	and	 predict 	 able 	 	,	of	 product 	 ivity 	 	.

we	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	will	merge	with	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	us	.
when	i	was	a	student	it	was	 a 	 cross 	 	campus	,	now	it	's	in	our	 pocket 	 s 	 	.

based	on	that	we	are	 announc 	 ing 	 	,	here	at	ted	,	in	true	ted	tradition	,	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	university	.
it	's	a	new	university	that	's	 found 	 ed 	 	by	peter	diamandis	,	who	is	here	in	the	audience	,	and	 my 	 self 	 	.
it	's	 back 	 ed 	 	by	nasa	and	google	,	and	other	 lead 	 ers 	 	in	the	high	-	tech	and	science	community	.
and	our	goal	was	to	assemble	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	both	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 student 	 s 	 	,	in	these	 exponential 	 ly 	 	growing	information	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	application	.
but	larry	page	made	an	 im 	 pass 	 ion 	 ed 	 	speech	at	our	 organ 	 izing 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	we	should	devote	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 address 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	major	 challeng 	 es 	 	facing	 human 	 ity 	 	.
and	if	we	did	that	,	then	google	would	back	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	that	's	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
the	last	third	of	the	nine	-	week	intensive	summer	session	will	be	 devote 	 d 	 	to	a	group	project	to	address	some	major	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.

and	these	 project 	 s 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	past	these	 session 	 s 	 	,	using	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	communication	.
all	the	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	that	is	 create 	 d 	 	and	taught	will	be	 on 	 line 	 	and	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	 develop 	 ed 	 	 on 	 line 	 	in	a	 collabor 	 ative 	 	fashion	.

it	will	be	 permanent 	 ly 	 	 head 	 quarter 	 ed 	 	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	at	the	nasa	ames	research	center	.
there	are	different	 program 	 s 	 	for	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ecutive 	 s 	 	at	different	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
