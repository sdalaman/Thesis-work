i	 stud 	 y 	 	ants	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	i	like	to	think	about	how	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	work	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	how	the	simple	 part 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	interact	to	create	the	behavior	of	the	whole	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
so	,	ant	 colon 	 ies 	 	are	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	like	that	,	and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	.	the	web	is	one	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 system 	 s 	 	like	that	--	 brain 	 s 	 	,	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 develop 	 ing 	 	 embryo 	 s 	 	.
there	are	about	10,000	species	of	ants	.
they	all	live	in	 colon 	 ies 	 	 consist 	 ing 	 	of	one	or	a	few	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	,	and	then	all	the	ants	you	see	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	are	 steril 	 e 	 	female	 work 	 ers 	 	.
and	all	ant	 colon 	 ies 	 	have	in	common	that	there	's	no	central	control	.
 no 	 body 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	 any 	 body 	 	what	to	do	.
the	 que 	 en 	 	just	 lay 	 s 	 	the	 egg 	 s 	 	.	there	's	no	management	.
no	ant	 direct 	 s 	 	the	behavior	of	any	other	ant	.
and	i	try	to	figure	out	how	that	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	the	past	20	 year 	 s 	 	on	a	population	of	seed	-	eating	ants	in	 south 	 eastern 	 	arizona	.
here	's	my	 stud 	 y 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	picture	of	ants	,	and	the	 rabbi 	 t 	 	just	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	there	.
and	these	ants	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 harvest 	 er 	 	ants	 be 	 cause 	 	they	eat	 seed 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	nest	of	the	mature	 colon 	 y 	 	,	and	there	's	the	nest	 en 	 trance 	 	.
and	they	 for 	 age 	 	 may 	 be 	 	for	about	20	 meter 	 s 	 	away	,	gather	up	the	 seed 	 s 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	them	back	to	the	nest	,	and	store	them	.
and	every	year	i	go	there	and	make	a	map	of	my	 stud 	 y 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	road	.	and	it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	big	:	it	's	about	250	 meter 	 s 	 	on	one	side	,	400	on	the	other	.
and	every	 colon 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	name	,	which	is	a	number	,	which	is	 paint 	 ed 	 	on	a	rock	.	and	i	go	there	every	year	and	look	for	all	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	the	year	before	,	and	figure	out	which	 one 	 s 	 	have	 di 	 ed 	 	,	and	put	all	the	new	 one 	 s 	 	on	the	map	.
and	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	i	know	how	old	they	all	are	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 stud 	 y 	 	how	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	 change 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 colon 	 y 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 old 	 er 	 	and	 large 	 r 	 	.
so	i	want	to	tell	you	about	the	life	cycle	of	a	 colon 	 y 	 	.
ants	never	make	more	ants	;	 colon 	 ies 	 	make	more	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
and	they	do	that	by	each	year	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	out	the	 re 	 productive 	 s 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	with	 wing 	 s 	 	--	on	a	 mat 	 ing 	 	flight	.
so	every	year	,	on	the	same	day	--	and	it	's	a	 myster 	 y 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	that	 happen 	 s 	 	--	each	 colon 	 y 	 	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	out	 it 	 s 	 	virgin	,	 un 	 mat 	 ed 	 	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	with	 wing 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 male 	 s 	 	,	and	they	all	fly	to	a	common	place	.	and	they	mate	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	virgin	 que 	 en 	 	.	here	's	her	 wing 	 s 	 	.
and	she	's	in	the	process	of	 mat 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	male	,	and	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	male	on	top	 wait 	 ing 	 	his	turn	.
often	the	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	mate	more	than	once	.
and	after	that	,	the	 male 	 s 	 	all	die	.	that	's	it	for	them	.
and	then	the	 new 	 ly 	 	 mat 	 ed 	 	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	fly	off	 some 	 where 	 	,	drop	 the 	 ir 	 	 wing 	 s 	 	,	dig	a	hole	and	go	 in 	 to 	 	that	hole	and	start	 lay 	 ing 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	.
and	they	will	live	for	15	or	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	lay	 egg 	 s 	 	using	the	 s 	 perm 	 	from	that	original	 mat 	 ing 	 	.
so	the	 que 	 en 	 	 go 	 es 	 	down	in	there	.
she	 lay 	 s 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	,	she	 feed 	 s 	 	the	 larva 	 e 	 	--	so	an	ant	 start 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	egg	,	then	it	's	a	larva	.
she	 feed 	 s 	 	the	 larva 	 e 	 	by	 regurgit 	 ating 	 	from	her	fat	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	.
then	,	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	the	ants	--	the	first	group	of	ants	--	emerge	,	they	're	 larva 	 e 	 	.	then	they	're	 pupa 	 e 	 	.	then	they	come	out	 a 	 s 	 	adult	ants	.
they	go	out	,	they	get	the	food	,	they	dig	the	nest	,	and	the	 que 	 en 	 	never	 come 	 s 	 	out	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	one	-	year	-	old	 colon 	 y 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	536	.
there	's	the	nest	 en 	 trance 	 	,	there	's	a	pencil	for	scale	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 colon 	 y 	 	 found 	 ed 	 	by	a	 que 	 en 	 	the	previous	summer	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	three	-	year	-	old	 colon 	 y 	 	.
there	's	the	nest	 en 	 trance 	 	,	there	's	a	pencil	for	scale	.
they	make	a	 mid 	 den 	 	,	a	pile	of	 re 	 fuse 	 	--	 most 	 ly 	 	the	 husk 	 s 	 	of	the	 seed 	 s 	 	that	they	eat	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	five	-	year	-	old	 colon 	 y 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	nest	 en 	 trance 	 	,	here	's	a	pencil	for	scale	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	they	get	,	about	a	meter	 a 	 cross 	 	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	 colon 	 y 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	and	 number 	 s 	 	of	 work 	 er 	 	ants	 change 	 s 	 	--	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	10,000	 work 	 er 	 	ants	--	 change 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	 colon 	 y 	 	age	,	in	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 start 	 s 	 	out	with	zero	ants	,	just	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 que 	 en 	 	,	and	it	 grow 	 s 	 	to	a	 s 	 ize 	 	of	about	10	or	12	thousand	ants	when	the	 colon 	 y 	 	is	five	.
and	it	 stay 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 ize 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	 que 	 en 	 	dies	and	there	's	 no 	 body 	 	to	make	more	ants	,	when	she	's	about	15	or	20	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	it	's	when	they	reach	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 table 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	,	in	 number 	 s 	 	of	ants	,	that	they	start	to	 re 	 produce 	 	.
that	is	,	to	 s 	 end 	 	more	 wing 	 ed 	 	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	and	 male 	 s 	 	to	that	year	's	 mat 	 ing 	 	flight	.
and	i	know	how	 colon 	 y 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	 colon 	 y 	 	age	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 d 	 ug 	 	up	 colon 	 ies 	 	of	known	age	and	 count 	 ed 	 	all	the	ants	.
so	that	's	not	the	most	 f 	 un 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	research	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	the	question	that	i	think	about	with	these	ants	is	what	i	call	task	 al 	 location 	 	.
that	's	not	just	how	is	the	 colon 	 y 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	,	but	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	change	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	?
how	is	it	that	the	 colon 	 y 	 	 manage 	 s 	 	to	adjust	the	 number 	 s 	 	of	 work 	 ers 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	each	task	 a 	 s 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	change	?
so	,	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	to	an	ant	 colon 	 y 	 	.
when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	in	the	summer	,	it	 flood 	 s 	 	in	the	desert	.
there	's	a	lot	of	damage	to	the	nest	,	and	extra	ants	are	 need 	 ed 	 	to	clean	up	that	mess	.
when	extra	food	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	about	 picnic 	 s 	 	--	then	extra	ants	are	 al 	 locate 	 d 	 	to	collect	the	food	.
so	,	with	 no 	 body 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 any 	 body 	 	what	to	do	,	how	is	it	that	the	 colon 	 y 	 	 manage 	 s 	 	to	adjust	the	 number 	 s 	 	of	 work 	 ers 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	each	task	?
and	that	's	the	process	that	i	call	task	 al 	 location 	 	.
and	in	 harvest 	 er 	 	ants	,	i	divide	the	 task 	 s 	 	of	the	ants	i	see	just	 out 	 side 	 	the	nest	 in 	 to 	 	these	four	 categor 	 ies 	 	:	where	an	ant	is	 for 	 aging 	 	,	when	it	's	out	 a 	 long 	 	the	 for 	 aging 	 	trail	,	 search 	 ing 	 	for	food	or	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	food	back	.
the	 pat 	 roller 	 s 	 	--	that	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	a	 magn 	 ifying 	 	glass	--	are	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	group	that	go	out	early	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	before	the	 forager 	 s 	 	are	active	.
they	 some 	 how 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	the	direction	that	the	 forager 	 s 	 	will	go	,	and	by	coming	back	--	just	by	making	it	back	--	they	tell	the	 forager 	 s 	 	that	it	's	safe	to	go	out	.
then	the	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	work	 in 	 side 	 	the	nest	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	that	the	 nest 	 s 	 	look	a	lot	like	bill	lishman	's	house	.
that	is	,	that	there	are	 chamber 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	they	line	the	 wall 	 s 	 	of	the	 chamber 	 s 	 	with	moist	 s 	 oil 	 	and	it	 d 	 ries 	 	to	a	kind	of	an	adobe	-	like	surface	in	it	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	some	of	the	cave	 dwelling 	 s 	 	of	the	hopi	people	that	are	in	that	area	.
and	the	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	do	that	 in 	 side 	 	the	nest	,	and	then	they	come	out	of	the	nest	 carry 	 ing 	 	bits	of	dry	 s 	 oil 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 man 	 d 	 ible 	 s 	 	.
so	you	see	the	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	come	out	with	a	bit	of	sand	,	put	it	down	,	turn	around	,	and	go	back	in	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	 mid 	 den 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	put	some	kind	of	 territ 	 orial 	 	chemical	in	the	garbage	.
so	what	you	see	the	 mid 	 den 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	is	making	a	pile	of	 re 	 fuse 	 	.
on	one	day	,	it	'll	all	be	here	,	and	then	the	next	day	they	'll	move	it	over	there	,	and	then	they	'll	move	it	back	.
so	that	's	what	the	 mid 	 den 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	do	.
and	these	four	 group 	 s 	 	are	just	the	ants	 out 	 side 	 	the	nest	.
so	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	25	percent	of	the	 colon 	 y 	 	,	and	they	're	the	 old 	 est 	 	ants	.
so	,	an	ant	 start 	 s 	 	out	 some 	 where 	 	near	the	 que 	 en 	 	.
and	when	we	dig	up	 nest 	 s 	 	we	find	they	're	about	 a 	 s 	 	deep	 a 	 s 	 	the	 colon 	 y 	 	is	wide	,	so	about	a	meter	deep	for	the	big	old	 nest 	 s 	 	.
and	then	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	long	tunnel	and	a	chamber	,	where	we	often	find	the	 que 	 en 	 	,	after	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 hack 	 ing 	 	away	at	the	rock	with	 pick 	 axe 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	that	chamber	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	me	and	my	 back 	 hoe 	 	and	my	crew	of	 student 	 s 	 	with	 pick 	 axe 	 s 	 	,	but	 in 	 stead 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	when	there	's	 flood 	 ing 	 	,	 occasion 	 ally 	 	the	 colon 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	go	down	deep	.
so	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	whole	network	of	 chamber 	 s 	 	.
the	 que 	 en 	 	's	in	there	 some 	 where 	 	;	she	just	 lay 	 s 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	.
there	's	the	 larva 	 e 	 	,	and	they	 consum 	 e 	 	most	of	the	food	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	of	most	ants	--	that	the	ants	you	see	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	do	n't	do	much	eating	.
they	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	and	feed	it	to	the	 larva 	 e 	 	.
when	the	 forager 	 s 	 	come	in	with	food	,	they	just	drop	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	upper	chamber	,	and	other	ants	come	up	from	 be 	 low 	 	,	get	the	food	,	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	,	husk	the	 seed 	 s 	 	,	and	pile	them	up	.
there	are	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	nest	.
and	 cur 	 iously 	 	,	and	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	at	any	time	about	half	the	ants	in	the	 colon 	 y 	 	are	just	 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	 de 	 spite 	 	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	in	the	 b 	 ible 	 	,	about	,	you	know	,	``	look	to	the	ant	,	 th 	 ou 	 	 s 	 lugg 	 ard 	 	,	``	in	fact	,	you	could	think	of	 t 	 hose 	 	ants	 a 	 s 	 	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	.
that	is	to	say	,	if	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	and	i	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	happen	,	but	i	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	looking	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	--	if	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	they	might	all	come	out	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	 most 	 ly 	 	they	're	just	 hang 	 ing 	 	around	in	there	.
and	i	think	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	--	what	is	there	about	the	way	the	 colon 	 y 	 	is	 organize 	 d 	 	that	might	give	some	function	to	a	 re 	 serve 	 	of	ants	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	?
and	they	sort	of	stand	 a 	 s 	 	a	 buff 	 er 	 	in	between	the	ants	 work 	 ing 	 	deep	 in 	 side 	 	the	nest	and	the	ants	 work 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	if	you	mark	ants	that	are	 work 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	dig	up	a	 colon 	 y 	 	,	you	never	see	them	deep	down	.
so	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	ants	work	 in 	 side 	 	the	nest	when	they	're	 young 	 er 	 	.
they	 some 	 how 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 serve 	 	.
and	then	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	they	get	 recruit 	 ed 	 	to	join	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 terior 	 	 work 	 force 	 	.
and	once	they	belong	to	the	ants	that	work	 out 	 side 	 	,	they	never	go	back	down	.
now	ants	--	most	ants	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	these	,	do	n't	see	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
they	have	 eye 	 s 	 	,	they	can	distinguish	between	light	and	dark	,	but	they	 most 	 ly 	 	work	by	smell	.
so	just	to	reinforce	that	what	you	might	have	thought	about	ant	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	is	n't	true	--	you	know	,	even	if	the	 que 	 en 	 	did	have	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	chemical	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	whole	network	of	 chamber 	 s 	 	to	tell	the	ants	 out 	 side 	 	what	to	do	,	there	is	no	way	that	 s 	 uch 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	could	make	it	in	time	to	see	the	 shift 	 s 	 	in	the	 al 	 location 	 	of	 work 	 ers 	 	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	 out 	 side 	 	the	nest	.
so	that	's	one	way	that	we	know	the	 que 	 en 	 	is	n't	 direct 	 ing 	 	the	behavior	of	the	 colon 	 y 	 	.
so	when	i	first	set	out	to	work	on	task	 al 	 location 	 	,	my	first	question	was	,	``	what	's	the	relationship	between	the	ants	 do 	 ing 	 	different	 task 	 s 	 	?
 do 	 es 	 	it	matter	to	the	 forager 	 s 	 	what	the	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	?
 do 	 es 	 	it	matter	to	the	 mid 	 den 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	what	the	 pat 	 roller 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	a	view	of	ant	 colon 	 ies 	 	in	which	each	ant	was	 some 	 how 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	task	from	birth	and	sort	of	 perform 	 ed 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	of	the	 other 	 s 	 	,	 know 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	place	on	the	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	ask	,	``	how	are	the	different	task	 group 	 s 	 	 inter 	 dependent 	 	?	``
so	i	did	 experiment 	 s 	 	where	i	 change 	 d 	 	one	thing	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	 create 	 d 	 	more	work	for	the	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	by	 put 	 ting 	 	out	a	pile	of	 tooth 	 pick 	 s 	 	near	the	nest	 en 	 trance 	 	,	early	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	when	the	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	are	first	active	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	about	20	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
here	it	is	about	40	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	the	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	just	take	all	the	 tooth 	 pick 	 s 	 	to	the	 out 	 er 	 	edge	of	the	nest	mound	and	 leav 	 e 	 	them	there	.
and	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	was	,	``	ok	,	here	's	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	extra	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 recruit 	 ed 	 	--	is	 th 	 is 	 	going	to	have	any	effect	on	the	 work 	 ers 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	other	 task 	 s 	 	?	``
then	we	 repeat 	 ed 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	the	ants	 mark 	 ed 	 	.
so	here	's	some	blue	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	.
and	 late 	 ly 	 	we	've	gotten	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	and	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	three	-	color	system	.
and	we	can	mark	them	 individual 	 ly 	 	so	we	know	which	ant	is	which	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	model	 air 	 plane 	 	paint	and	then	we	found	these	 wonder 	 ful 	 	little	japanese	 marker 	 s 	 	,	and	they	work	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
and	so	just	to	summarize	the	result	,	well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 y 	 es 	 	,	the	different	 task 	 s 	 	are	 inter 	 dependent 	 	.
so	,	if	i	change	the	 number 	 s 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	one	task	,	it	 change 	 s 	 	the	 number 	 s 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	i	make	a	mess	that	the	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	have	to	clean	up	,	then	i	see	 few 	 er 	 	ants	out	 for 	 aging 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	true	for	all	the	pair	-	wise	 combination 	 s 	 	of	 task 	 s 	 	.
and	the	second	result	,	which	was	surprising	to	a	lot	of	people	,	was	that	ants	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 witch 	 	 task 	 s 	 	.
the	same	ant	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	the	same	task	over	and	over	 it 	 s 	 	whole	life	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	i	put	out	extra	food	,	 every 	 body 	 	else	--	the	 mid 	 den 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	stop	 do 	 ing 	 	 mid 	 den 	 	work	and	go	get	the	food	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 forager 	 s 	 	.
the	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 forager 	 s 	 	.
the	 pat 	 roller 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 forager 	 s 	 	.
but	not	every	 transit 	 ion 	 	is	possible	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
like	i	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	there	is	more	food	to	collect	,	the	 pat 	 roller 	 s 	 	,	the	 mid 	 den 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	,	the	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	will	all	change	to	 for 	 age 	 	.
if	there	's	more	 patrol 	 ling 	 	to	do	--	so	i	 create 	 d 	 	a	 disturb 	 ance 	 	,	so	extra	 pat 	 roller 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	--	the	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	will	 s 	 witch 	 	to	patrol	.
but	if	more	nest	maintenance	work	is	 need 	 ed 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	i	put	out	a	bunch	of	 tooth 	 pick 	 s 	 	--	then	 no 	 body 	 	will	ever	 s 	 witch 	 	back	to	nest	maintenance	,	they	have	to	get	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	from	 in 	 side 	 	the	nest	.
so	 for 	 aging 	 	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	sink	,	and	the	ants	 in 	 side 	 	the	nest	act	 a 	 s 	 	a	source	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	each	ant	is	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	moment	to	moment	 whet 	 her 	 	to	be	active	or	not	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	there	's	extra	nest	maintenance	work	to	do	,	it	's	not	that	the	 forager 	 s 	 	 s 	 witch 	 	over	.	i	know	that	they	do	n't	do	that	.
but	the	 forager 	 s 	 	 some 	 how 	 	decide	not	to	come	out	.
and	here	was	the	most	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	result	:	the	task	 al 	 location 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	process	 change 	 s 	 	with	 colon 	 y 	 	age	,	and	it	 change 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
when	i	do	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	 old 	 er 	 	 colon 	 ies 	 	--	so	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	five	 year 	 s 	 	or	 old 	 er 	 	--	they	're	much	more	 consist 	 ent 	 	from	one	time	to	 an 	 other 	 	and	much	more	 home 	 o 	 static 	 	.	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	get	,	the	more	i	hassle	them	,	the	more	they	act	like	 un 	 disturb 	 ed 	 	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	young	,	small	 colon 	 ies 	 	--	the	two	-	year	-	old	 colon 	 ies 	 	of	just	2,000	ants	--	are	much	more	 vari 	 able 	 	.
and	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	an	ant	 live 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	year	.
it	could	be	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
so	,	the	ants	in	the	 old 	 er 	 	 colon 	 y 	 	that	seem	to	be	more	 s 	 table 	 	are	not	any	 old 	 er 	 	than	the	ants	in	the	 young 	 er 	 	 colon 	 y 	 	.
it	's	not	due	to	the	experience	of	 old 	 er 	 	,	 wis 	 er 	 	ants	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	must	be	changing	 a 	 s 	 	the	 colon 	 y 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 old 	 er 	 	.
and	the	obvious	thing	that	's	changing	is	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
so	since	i	've	had	 th 	 is 	 	result	,	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	decision	 rule 	 s 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	local	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ol 	 factor 	 y 	 	,	chemical	 rule 	 s 	 	could	an	ant	could	be	using	,	since	no	ant	can	assess	the	global	 situ 	 ation 	 	--	that	would	have	the	 out 	 come 	 	that	i	see	,	these	 predict 	 able 	 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	in	who	 do 	 es 	 	what	task	.
and	it	would	change	 a 	 s 	 	the	 colon 	 y 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 large 	 r 	 	.
and	what	i	've	found	out	is	that	ants	are	using	a	network	of	 antenna 	 l 	 	contact	.
so	 any 	 body 	 	who	's	ever	 look 	 ed 	 	at	ants	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	them	touch	 antenna 	 e 	 	.
they	smell	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 antenna 	 e 	 	.
when	one	ant	 touch 	 es 	 	 an 	 other 	 	,	it	's	 smell 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	it	can	tell	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	the	other	ant	is	a	nest	mate	 be 	 cause 	 	ants	cover	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	each	other	,	through	 groom 	 ing 	 	,	with	a	layer	of	 gr 	 ease 	 	,	which	 car 	 ries 	 	a	 colon 	 y 	 	-	specific	odor	.
and	what	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	that	an	ant	uses	the	pattern	of	 it 	 s 	 	 antenna 	 l 	 	 contact 	 s 	 	,	the	rate	at	which	it	 meet 	 s 	 	ants	of	other	 task 	 s 	 	,	in	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	what	to	do	.
and	so	what	the	 mess 	 age 	 	is	,	is	not	any	 mess 	 age 	 	that	they	transmit	from	one	ant	to	 an 	 other 	 	,	but	the	pattern	.
the	pattern	 it 	 self 	 	is	the	 mess 	 age 	 	.
and	i	'll	tell	you	a	little	bit	more	about	that	.
but	first	you	might	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	:	how	is	it	that	an	ant	can	tell	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	'm	a	forager	.
i	expect	to	meet	 an 	 other 	 	forager	every	so	often	.
but	if	 in 	 stead 	 	i	start	to	meet	a	 high 	 er 	 	number	of	nest	maintenance	 work 	 ers 	 	,	i	'm	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 for 	 age 	 	.
so	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	know	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	forager	and	a	nest	maintenance	 work 	 er 	 	.
and	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	species	--	and	i	suspect	in	 other 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	--	these	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	layer	of	 gr 	 ease 	 	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	ants	,	is	different	 a 	 s 	 	ants	perform	different	 task 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	that	show	that	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 long 	 er 	 	an	ant	 stay 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	,	the	more	these	simple	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	surface	change	,	and	so	they	come	to	smell	different	by	 do 	 ing 	 	different	 task 	 s 	 	.
and	they	can	use	that	task	-	specific	odor	in	 cut 	 icular 	 	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	--	they	can	use	that	in	 the 	 ir 	 	brief	 antenna 	 l 	 	 contact 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 how 	 	keep	track	of	the	rate	at	which	they	're	 meet 	 ing 	 	ants	of	certain	 task 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 demonst 	 rated 	 	 th 	 is 	 	by	 put 	 ting 	 	 ex 	 tract 	 	of	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	on	little	glass	 be 	 ad 	 s 	 	,	and	dropping	the	 be 	 ad 	 s 	 	 gent 	 ly 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	nest	 en 	 trance 	 	at	the	right	rate	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	ants	will	respond	to	the	right	rate	of	contact	with	a	glass	 be 	 ad 	 	with	 hydro 	 carbon 	 	 ex 	 tract 	 	on	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	would	to	contact	with	real	ants	.
so	i	want	now	to	show	you	a	bit	of	film	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	will	start	out	,	first	of	all	,	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	nest	 en 	 trance 	 	.
so	the	idea	is	that	ants	are	coming	in	and	out	of	the	nest	 en 	 trance 	 	.
they	've	gone	out	to	do	different	 task 	 s 	 	,	and	the	rate	at	which	they	meet	 a 	 s 	 	they	come	in	and	out	of	the	nest	 en 	 trance 	 	 determine 	 s 	 	,	or	 influence 	 s 	 	,	each	ant	's	decision	about	 whet 	 her 	 	to	go	out	,	and	which	task	to	perform	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	taken	through	a	fiber	 optic 	 s 	 	 micro 	 scope 	 	.	it	's	down	 in 	 side 	 	the	nest	.
in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	you	see	the	ants	just	kind	of	 engag 	 ing 	 	with	the	fiber	 optic 	 s 	 	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
but	the	idea	is	that	the	ants	are	in	there	,	and	each	ant	is	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	a	certain	flow	of	ants	past	it	--	a	stream	of	 contact 	 s 	 	with	other	ants	.
and	the	pattern	of	these	 interact 	 ions 	 	 determine 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	the	ant	 come 	 s 	 	back	out	,	and	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	back	out	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	ants	just	 out 	 side 	 	the	nest	 en 	 trance 	 	like	these	.
each	ant	,	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	back	in	,	is	 contact 	 ing 	 	other	ants	.
and	the	ants	that	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	just	 in 	 side 	 	the	nest	 en 	 trance 	 	to	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	to	go	out	on	 the 	 ir 	 	next	trip	,	are	 contact 	 ing 	 	the	ants	coming	in	.
so	,	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	system	is	that	it	's	 mess 	 y 	 	.
it	's	 vari 	 able 	 	.	it	's	noisy	.	and	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	in	two	ways	.
the	first	is	that	the	experience	of	the	ant	--	of	each	ant	--	ca	n't	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	rate	at	which	ants	come	back	 depend 	 s 	 	on	all	the	little	 thing 	 s 	 	that	happen	to	an	ant	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	out	and	 do 	 es 	 	 it 	 s 	 	task	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	the	second	thing	is	that	an	ant	's	ability	to	assess	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	must	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	no	ant	can	do	any	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 count 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	we	do	a	lot	of	 simul 	 ation 	 	and	 model 	 ing 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 experiment 	 al 	 	work	,	to	try	to	figure	out	how	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	noise	combine	to	,	in	the	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	,	produce	the	 predict 	 able 	 	behavior	of	ant	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	do	n't	want	to	say	that	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 hap 	 hazard 	 	pattern	of	 interact 	 ions 	 	 produce 	 s 	 	a	 factor 	 y 	 	that	 work 	 s 	 	with	the	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	and	efficiency	of	 clock 	 work 	 	.
in	fact	,	if	you	watch	ants	at	all	,	you	end	up	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	never	seem	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	way	that	you	think	that	they	ought	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	that	out	of	these	 hap 	 hazard 	 	 contact 	 s 	 	,	 perfect 	 ion 	 	 arise 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 work 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	.
ants	have	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
they	cover	the	earth	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	antarctica	.
 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	of	 hap 	 hazard 	 	 contact 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	,	 produce 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	ants	to	make	a	lot	more	ants	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	is	how	natural	 s 	 election 	 	might	be	 act 	 ing 	 	now	to	shape	 th 	 is 	 	use	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	network	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	--	to	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 for 	 aging 	 	efficiency	of	ant	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
so	the	one	thing	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	that	i	want	you	to	remember	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 interact 	 ions 	 	are	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	'd	expect	to	be	 close 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 colon 	 y 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
the	 simpl 	 est 	 	idea	is	that	when	an	ant	is	in	a	small	 colon 	 y 	 	--	and	an	ant	in	a	large	 colon 	 y 	 	can	use	the	same	rule	,	like	``	i	expect	to	meet	 an 	 other 	 	forager	every	three	 second 	 s 	 	.	``
but	in	a	small	 colon 	 y 	 	,	it	's	 like 	 ly 	 	to	meet	 few 	 er 	 	 forager 	 s 	 	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 few 	 er 	 	other	 forager 	 s 	 	there	to	meet	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	rule	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 colon 	 y 	 	 develop 	 s 	 	and	 get 	 s 	 	 old 	 er 	 	and	 large 	 r 	 	,	will	produce	different	behavior	in	an	old	 colon 	 y 	 	and	a	small	young	one	.
thank	you	.
