imagine	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	seven	 year 	 s 	 	at	mit	and	research	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	to	find	out	that	you	're	a	performance	artist	.
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	engineer	,	and	i	make	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	art	with	the	computer	.
and	i	think	the	main	thing	that	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	a	way	of	making	the	computer	 in 	 to 	 	a	personal	mode	of	 express 	 ion 	 	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	out	there	are	the	 head 	 s 	 	of	macromedia	and	 micro 	 soft 	 	,	and	in	a	way	 t 	 hose 	 	are	my	 ban 	 e 	 	:	i	think	there	's	a	great	 homogen 	 izing 	 	force	that	 soft 	 ware 	 	 impose 	 s 	 	on	people	and	 limit 	 s 	 	the	way	they	think	about	what	's	possible	on	the	computer	.
of	course	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	great	 liber 	 ating 	 	force	that	 make 	 s 	 	possible	,	you	know	,	 publish 	 ing 	 	and	so	forth	,	and	 standard 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	.
but	,	in	a	way	,	the	computer	 make 	 s 	 	possible	much	more	than	what	most	people	think	,	and	my	art	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	a	personal	way	of	using	the	computer	,	and	so	i	end	up	writing	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	do	that	.
chris	 ha 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	a	short	performance	,	and	so	i	'm	going	to	take	just	 th 	 is 	 	time	--	 may 	 be 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	--	to	do	that	,	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	at	the	end	have	just	a	moment	to	show	you	a	couple	of	my	other	 project 	 s 	 	in	video	form	.
thank	you	.
we	've	got	about	a	minute	left	.
i	'd	just	like	to	show	a	clip	from	a	most	 re 	 cent 	 	project	.
i	did	a	performance	with	two	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	who	 special 	 ize 	 	in	making	strange	 noise 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 mouth 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	just	came	off	last	september	at	ars	electronica	;	we	 repeat 	 ed 	 	it	in	england	.
and	the	idea	is	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	speech	and	song	 be 	 hind 	 	them	with	a	large	screen	.
we	used	a	computer	vision	 track 	 ing 	 	system	in	order	to	know	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
and	since	we	know	where	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	are	,	and	we	have	a	 wire 	 less 	 	mic	on	them	that	we	're	 process 	 ing 	 	the	sound	from	,	we	're	able	to	create	 visual 	 ization 	 s 	 	which	are	linked	 ver 	 y 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	to	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	speech	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	take	about	30	 second 	 s 	 	or	so	.
he	's	making	a	,	kind	of	,	cheek	-	flapping	sound	.
well	,	 suff 	 ice 	 	it	to	say	it	's	not	all	like	that	,	but	that	's	part	of	it	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	more	.
i	'm	 over 	 time 	 	,	so	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	you	can	,	if	you	're	in	new	york	,	you	can	check	out	my	work	at	the	whitney	biennial	next	week	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	at	bitforms	 gall 	 ery 	 	in	chelsea	.
and	with	that	,	i	think	i	should	give	up	the	stage	,	so	,	thank	you	so	much	.
