two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	here	at	ted	i	 report 	 ed 	 	that	we	had	 discover 	 ed 	 	at	saturn	,	with	the	cassini	 space 	 craft 	 	,	an	 anomal 	 ously 	 	warm	and	 geo 	 logically 	 	active	region	at	the	southern	tip	of	the	small	saturnine	moon	enceladus	,	 s 	 een 	 	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	region	 s 	 een 	 	here	for	the	first	time	in	the	cassini	image	taken	in	2005	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	south	polar	region	,	with	the	famous	tiger	-	 strip 	 e 	 	 fracture 	 s 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	south	pole	.
and	 s 	 een 	 	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	in	late	2008	,	here	is	that	region	 aga 	 in 	 	,	now	half	in	 dark 	 ness 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	southern	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	is	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	the	 on 	 set 	 	of	august	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	winter	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	that	we	'd	made	 th 	 is 	 	mind	-	 blow 	 ing 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	once	-	in	-	a	-	 life 	 time 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	of	 tower 	 ing 	 	 jet 	 s 	 	 erupt 	 ing 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 fracture 	 s 	 	at	the	south	pole	,	 consist 	 ing 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	water	ice	 crystal 	 s 	 	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	water	vapor	and	simple	 organ 	 ic 	 	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	like	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	and	 m 	 ethane 	 	.
and	at	that	time	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 specul 	 ating 	 	that	these	 jet 	 s 	 	might	in	fact	be	 geyser 	 s 	 	,	and	 erupt 	 ing 	 	from	 pocket 	 s 	 	or	 chamber 	 s 	 	of	liquid	water	 under 	 neath 	 	the	surface	,	but	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 result 	 s 	 	--	of	a	possible	environment	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	moon	that	could	support	 pre 	 biotic 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	life	 it 	 self 	 	--	 we 	 re 	 	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	that	,	in	the	 inter 	 ve 	 ning 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	have	focused	more	on	enceladus	.
we	've	 flow 	 n 	 	the	cassini	 space 	 craft 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	moon	now	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	 close 	 r 	 	and	 deep 	 er 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 jet 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	 region 	 s 	 	of	these	 jet 	 s 	 	,	so	that	now	we	have	come	away	with	some	 ver 	 y 	 	precise	 com 	 position 	 al 	 	 measure 	 ments 	 	.
and	we	have	found	that	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	coming	from	 th 	 is 	 	moon	are	in	fact	more	complex	than	we	 previous 	 ly 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	.
while	they	're	not	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	we	're	now	 find 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 pro 	 pane 	 	and	 be 	 n 	 zen 	 e 	 	,	hydrogen	 cyan 	 ide 	 	,	and	 form 	 aldehyde 	 	.
and	the	 tin 	 y 	 	water	 crystal 	 s 	 	here	now	look	for	all	the	world	like	they	are	 froze 	 n 	 	 drop 	 lets 	 	of	 salt 	 y 	 	water	,	which	is	a	 discover 	 y 	 	that	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	the	 jet 	 s 	 	come	from	 pocket 	 s 	 	of	liquid	water	,	but	that	that	liquid	water	is	in	contact	with	rock	.
and	that	is	a	 circum 	 stance 	 	that	could	supply	the	chemical	energy	and	the	chemical	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	sustain	life	.
so	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 encourag 	 ed 	 	by	these	 result 	 s 	 	.
and	we	are	much	more	confident	now	than	we	 we 	 re 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	we	might	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	have	on	 th 	 is 	 	moon	,	under	the	south	pole	,	an	environment	or	a	zone	that	is	hospitable	to	living	 organism 	 s 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	there	are	living	 organism 	 s 	 	there	,	of	course	,	is	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	matter	.
and	that	will	have	to	await	the	 arriv 	 al 	 	,	back	at	enceladus	,	of	the	 space 	 craft 	 s 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	some	time	in	the	near	future	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	 equi 	 pped 	 	to	address	that	 part 	 icular 	 	question	.
but	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	i	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	imagine	the	day	when	we	might	journey	to	the	saturnine	system	,	and	visit	the	enceladus	 inter 	 planetary 	 	geyser	park	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	.
thank	you	.
