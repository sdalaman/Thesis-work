there	's	a	lot	of	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	design	world	and	at	ideo	 th 	 is 	 	past	year	,	and	i	'm	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	get	a	chance	to	share	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	with	you	.
i	did	n't	attend	the	first	ted	back	in	1984	but	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	a	lot	of	them	since	that	time	.
i	thought	it	[	would	]	kind	of	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	think	back	to	that	time	when	richard	got	the	whole	thing	 start 	 ed 	 	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	richard	;	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	big	,	 enjoy 	 able 	 	part	of	my	life	,	coming	here	.
and	so	 think 	 ing 	 	back	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	focused	on	 product 	 s 	 	or	 object 	 s 	 	--	 certain 	 ly 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	 object 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	was	great	 f 	 un 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	in	the	audience	 we 	 re 	 	my	 client 	 s 	 	.
we	'd	come	in	with	some	prototype	 under 	 neath 	 	a	black	cloth	and	we	'd	put	it	on	the	 con 	 ference 	 	table	,	and	we	'd	pull	off	the	black	cloth	and	 every 	 body 	 	would	``	ooh	``	and	``	ah	.	``
that	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	time	.
and	so	we	'll	 continu 	 e 	 	to	focus	on	 product 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ways 	 	have	.
and	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	here	last	year	,	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	 wrestl 	 ed 	 	you	to	the	floor	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	my	new	eyemodule	2	,	which	was	a	camera	that	 plug 	 ged 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	handspring	.
and	i	took	a	lot	of	 picture 	 s 	 	last	year	;	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	 k 	 new 	 	what	i	was	up	to	,	but	i	took	a	lot	of	 picture 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	--	 may 	 be 	 	you	could	show	the	 slide 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	year	we	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	treo	,	which	we	had	a	lot	to	do	with	and	 help 	 ed 	 	handspring	design	it	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	we	designed	it	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	it	's	just	 be 	 come 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	in	the	last	year	or	so	--	 th 	 is 	 	heartstream	 defi 	 brill 	 ator 	 	which	is	saving	 live 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	them	in	the	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	?	they	seem	to	be	 every 	 where 	 	now	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	 t 	 hose 	 	.
and	,	we	're	just	about	to	announce	the	zinio	 read 	 er 	 	product	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	will	make	 magazine 	 s 	 	even	more	 enjoy 	 able 	 	to	read	.
so	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	focus	on	 product 	 s 	 	.
but	 some 	 thing 	 	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	18	 year 	 s 	 	since	richard	 start 	 ed 	 	ted	,	and	that	's	that	people	like	us	--	i	know	people	in	other	 place 	 s 	 	have	caught	onto	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	long	time	,	but	for	us	,	we	've	 re 	 ally 	 	just	 start 	 ed 	 	...	we	've	kind	of	 climb 	 ed 	 	maslow	's	 hierarch 	 y 	 	a	little	bit	--	and	so	we	're	now	focused	more	and	more	on	human	-	 center 	 ed 	 	design	,	human	-	centeredness	in	an	approach	to	design	.
that	 re 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 s 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	and	 personal 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	you	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	that	,	and	it	's	making	our	job	even	more	 enjoy 	 able 	 	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	we	used	to	 prim 	 arily 	 	build	3	-	d	 model 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	some	 to 	 day 	 	--	and	3	-	d	 render 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
then	we	'd	go	and	we	'd	show	 t 	 hose 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	our	 idea 	 s 	 	.
but	 firm 	 s 	 	like	 our 	 s 	 	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	move	to	a	point	where	we	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 object 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	and	get	them	in	motion	,	 show 	 ing 	 	how	they	'll	be	used	.
and	so	in	order	to	do	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	internal	video	-	production	 group 	 s 	 	in	order	to	make	these	kind	of	experience	 prototype 	 s 	 	that	show	just	what	we	mean	about	the	man	-	machine	relationship	.
and	it	's	a	much	better	way	to	see	.
it	's	kind	of	like	 architect 	 s 	 	who	show	people	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 house 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	them	 be 	 ing 	 	empty	.
so	i	thought	that	i	would	show	you	a	few	 video 	 s 	 	to	show	off	 th 	 is 	 	new	,	 broad 	 er 	 	definition	of	design	in	 product 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	and	 environment 	 s 	 	.
i	have	a	few	of	them	--	they	're	no	more	than	a	minute	or	a	minute	-	and	-	a	-	half	 a 	 piece 	 	--	but	i	thought	you	might	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 see 	 ing 	 	some	of	our	work	over	the	last	year	,	and	how	it	 respond 	 s 	 	in	video	.
so	,	prada	new	york	:	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	rem	koolhaas	and	oma	to	help	us	 conceiv 	 e 	 	the	technology	that	's	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 re 	 tail 	 	store	in	new	york	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	a	new	kind	of	store	--	a	new	one	--	a	store	that	had	a	cultural	role	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 tail 	 	one	.
and	that	 me 	 ant 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	custom	technology	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	just	 buy 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	off	the	shelf	and	 put 	 ting 	 	them	to	use	.
so	,	there	're	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.	 every 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	rf	 tag 	 s 	 	:	there	's	rf	 tag 	 s 	 	on	the	user	,	on	the	 card 	 s 	 	,	there	's	the	staff	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	are	all	around	the	store	.
you	pick	them	up	,	and	once	you	see	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	the	staff	person	can	 s 	 can 	 	them	in	and	then	they	can	be	 show 	 n 	 	on	any	screen	 through 	 out 	 	the	store	.
you	can	look	at	color	,	and	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	,	and	how	it	 appear 	 ed 	 	on	the	 run 	 way 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	so	then	the	object	--	the	 merchan 	 dis 	 e 	 	that	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	--	can	be	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	.	it	's	taken	 in 	 to 	 	the	 dress 	 ing 	 	room	,	and	in	the	 dress 	 ing 	 	room	there	are	 scanner 	 s 	 	so	that	we	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 cloth 	 ing 	 	you	have	in	the	 dress 	 ing 	 	room	.
we	can	put	that	up	on	a	touch	screen	and	you	can	play	with	that	,	and	get	more	information	about	the	 cloth 	 ing 	 	that	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	it	on	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	used	a	lot	of	 place 	 s 	 	,	but	i	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	like	the	use	here	of	liquid	crystal	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	in	the	changing	room	.
the	last	time	i	went	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	store	,	there	was	a	huge	buzz	about	people	 stand 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	``	am	i	going	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	to	see	the	people	changing	 clothe 	 s 	 	here	?	``
but	if	you	push	the	button	,	of	course	,	the	whole	wall	 go 	 es 	 	dark	.
so	you	can	try	to	get	approval	,	or	not	,	for	 what 	 ever 	 	you	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	of	the	technology	is	the	magic	mirror	,	where	you	put	on	the	 clothe 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	big	 dis 	 play 	 	in	the	mirror	,	and	you	can	turn	around	--	but	there	's	a	three	second	delay	.
so	you	can	see	what	you	look	like	from	the	back	or	all	the	way	around	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	look	.
about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	design	an	 install 	 ation 	 	in	the	museum	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	wing	of	the	science	museum	in	london	,	and	it	's	 prim 	 arily 	 	about	digital	and	 bio 	 medical 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	a	group	at	itch	,	which	is	now	part	of	ideo	,	designed	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	wall	that	's	about	four	 st 	 ories 	 	tall	.
i	do	n't	know	if	 any 	 body 	 	's	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	spectacular	in	the	room	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	it	's	based	on	the	london	 sub 	 way 	 	system	.
and	so	you	can	see	that	the	goal	is	to	 br 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	 feed 	 back 	 	that	the	people	who	had	gone	to	the	museum	 we 	 re 	 	giving	,	and	get	it	up	on	the	wall	so	 every 	 body 	 	could	see	.	just	for	 every 	 body 	 	to	see	.
so	you	enter	your	information	.	then	,	like	the	london	tube	system	,	the	little	 train 	 s 	 	go	around	with	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
and	then	when	you	get	to	a	station	,	it	's	 expand 	 ed 	 	so	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	read	it	.
then	when	you	exit	the	imax	theatre	on	the	fourth	floor	--	 most 	 ly 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	coming	out	of	there	--	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	big	open	space	that	 ha 	 s 	 	these	 table 	 s 	 	in	it	that	have	 inter 	 active 	 	 game 	 s 	 	which	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 f 	 un 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	designed	by	durrell	[	bishop	]	and	andrew	[	hirniak	]	of	itch	.
and	the	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	include	 thing 	 s 	 	that	the	museum	is	about	:	male	 fertil 	 ity 	 	,	 choos 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 ex 	 	of	your	baby	or	what	a	 driver 	 less 	 	car	might	be	like	.
there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	room	,	so	people	can	come	up	and	understand	what	it	is	before	they	get	 involve 	 d 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	it	's	not	 show 	 n 	 	in	the	video	,	but	these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
they	go	to	the	top	of	the	wall	and	when	they	reach	all	the	way	to	the	top	,	after	they	've	 bounc 	 ed 	 	around	,	they	 dispers 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	bits	and	go	off	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	.
the	next	video	is	not	 d 	 one 	 	by	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	cbs	sunday	 morn 	 ing 	 	that	 air 	 ed 	 	about	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
scott	adams	ran	 in 	 to 	 	us	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	if	we	would	n't	help	to	design	the	ultimate	 cubic 	 le 	 	for	dilbert	,	which	 sound 	 ed 	 	like	a	 f 	 un 	 	thing	and	so	we	could	n't	pass	it	up	.

(	video	:	scott	adams	:	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	at	some	point	i	might	be	the	world	's	expert	on	what	's	wrong	with	 cubic 	 les 	 	.
so	we	thought	,	well	,	would	n't	it	be	 f 	 un 	 	to	get	together	with	some	of	the	 smart 	 est 	 	design	 guy 	 s 	 	in	the	world	and	try	to	figure	out	if	we	could	make	the	 cubic 	 le 	 	better	?

 be 	 hind 	 	the	humor	is	the	idea	of	making	the	 cubic 	 le 	 	more	human	.	)	david	kelley	:	so	here	's	the	final	thing	,	complete	with	 o 	 range 	 	 light 	 ing 	 	that	 follow 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	--	that	 follow 	 s 	 	the	 track 	 s 	 	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	--	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sky	.

dk	:	and	of	course	:	a	 ham 	 mock 	 	for	your	afternoon	nap	that	 stretch 	 es 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	your	 cubic 	 le 	 	.
dk	:	 th 	 is 	 	next	project	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	design	a	pavilion	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	 recycl 	 ing 	 	of	the	water	on	the	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 dom 	 e 	 	in	london	.
the	 dom 	 e 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	amount	of	water	that	 wash 	 es 	 	off	of	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 waste 	 water 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	building	 actual 	 ly 	 	 celebr 	 ates 	 	the	water	 a 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 recycl 	 ing 	 	plant	and	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 re 	 ed 	 	bed	so	that	it	can	be	 filter 	 ed 	 	for	the	final	time	.
the	pavilion	's	design	goal	was	to	be	kind	of	quiet	and	 peace 	 ful 	 	.
in	contrast	to	if	you	went	 in 	 side 	 	the	 dom 	 e 	 	,	where	it	's	kind	of	wild	and	crazy	and	 every 	 body 	 	's	 learn 	 ing 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	or	 fool 	 ing 	 	around	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
but	it	was	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	quiet	.
and	then	you	would	wander	around	and	gather	information	,	in	a	 straight 	 forward 	 	fashion	,	about	the	 recycl 	 ing 	 	process	and	what	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	how	they	're	going	to	 re 	 use 	 	the	water	once	it	 come 	 s 	 	through	the	plant	.
and	then	,	if	you	saw	,	the	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 rot 	 ate 	 	.	so	you	can	get	the	information	on	the	front	side	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	they	 rot 	 ate 	 	,	you	can	see	the	actual	 recycl 	 ing 	 	plant	 be 	 hind 	 	,	with	all	the	 machine 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	process	the	water	.
you	can	see	:	there	's	the	plant	.

it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	spyfish	,	and	it	's	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	h	2eye	,	 start 	 ed 	 	by	nigel	jagger	in	london	.
and	it	's	a	company	that	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	experience	--	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 boat 	 s 	 	,	or	enjoy	 be 	 ing 	 	on	 boat 	 s 	 	,	but	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 percent 	 age 	 	of	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	the	 cap 	 ability 	 	or	the	interest	in	going	under	the	water	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	what	's	there	,	and	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	what	scuba	divers	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	product	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 camera 	 s 	 	.
you	throw	it	over	the	side	of	your	boat	and	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	scuba	 d 	 ive 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	wet	.
for	us	--	there	's	the	object	--	for	us	,	it	was	two	 project 	 s 	 	.	one	,	to	design	the	 inter 	 face 	 	so	that	the	 inter 	 face 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	in	your	way	.
you	could	have	that	kind	of	 immers 	 ive 	 	experience	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 under 	 water 	 	--	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	you	're	 under 	 water 	 	--	 see 	 ing 	 	what	's	going	on	.
and	the	other	one	was	to	design	the	object	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	it	was	a	consumer	product	and	not	a	research	tool	.
and	so	we	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	--	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	for	about	seven	or	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	project	--	and	[	we	're	]	just	ready	to	start	building	them	.

the	fluid	 graphic 	 s 	 	and	 ambi 	 ent 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	combine	to	help	you	 complete 	 ly 	 	lose	 your 	 self 	 	 under 	 water 	 	.	)	dk	:	and	the	last	thing	i	'll	talk	about	is	approtec	,	which	is	a	project	that	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	.
approtec	is	a	company	 start 	 ed 	 	by	dr.	martin	 fish 	 er 	 	,	who	's	a	good	friend	of	mine	.	he	's	a	ph.d.	from	stanford	.
he	found	 him 	 self 	 	in	kenya	on	a	fulbright	and	he	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	,	which	is	that	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	must	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	in	kenya	;	there	must	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.	``
and	he	 notice 	 d 	 	that	for	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 funeral 	 s 	 	there	they	could	find	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	put	 some 	 thing 	 	together	.
so	he	 decide 	 d 	 	to	start	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 product 	 s 	 	in	kenya	with	kenyan	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	--	designed	by	people	like	us	,	but	taken	there	.
and	to	 th 	 is 	 	date	--	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	gone	for	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	--	he	's	 start 	 ed 	 	19,000	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
he	's	made	30,000	new	 job 	 s 	 	.
and	just	the	 sale 	 s 	 	of	the	 product 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	non	-	profit	--	the	 sale 	 s 	 	of	these	 product 	 s 	 	is	now	.6	%	of	the	gdp	of	kenya	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	guy	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	spectacular	thing	.
so	we	're	in	the	process	of	 help 	 ing 	 	them	design	deep	-	well	,	low	-	cost	manual	 pump 	 s 	 	in	order	for	these	people	who	have	a	quarter	acre	of	land	to	be	able	to	grow	 crop 	 s 	 	in	the	off	-	season	.
what	they	do	now	is	:	they	can	grow	 crop 	 s 	 	in	the	 rain 	 y 	 	season	but	they	ca	n't	grow	them	in	the	off	-	season	.
and	so	by	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	the	woman	that	you	saw	in	the	first	thing	--	she	's	a	school	teacher	--	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	her	 kid 	 s 	 	to	college	and	she	's	going	to	be	able	to	do	it	 be 	 cause 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	with	seed	-	 squeez 	 ers 	 	,	and	 pump 	 s 	 	,	and	hay	-	balers	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	--	my	 student 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	class	 project 	 s 	 	and	ideo	 ha 	 s 	 	 don 	 ated 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	time	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	work	--	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	see	his	success	,	martin	's	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	experience	of	richard	,	and	so	--	--	we	designed	 th 	 is 	 	hat	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	'd	be	the	last	one	in	the	day	and	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	deal	with	him	.	so	i	just	have	one	more	thing	to	say	.
can	you	read	it	?
well	,	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	kind	of	funny	when	he	 come 	 s 	 	up	and	 hover 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	you	do	n't	want	to	be	rude	to	him	and	you	do	n't	want	to	feel	 guilt 	 y 	 	,	and	so	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	would	do	it	,	where	i	just	 s 	 it 	 	here	.
so	we	saw	a	lot	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	designed	 to 	 day 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	session	,	and	from	all	the	different	 present 	 ers 	 	.
and	in	my	own	practice	,	from	product	to	approtec	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	that	we	're	taking	a	more	human	-	 center 	 ed 	 	approach	to	design	,	that	we	're	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	and	 personal 	 ities 	 	in	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	.
 design 	 ers 	 	are	more	 trust 	 ed 	 	and	more	 integrate 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	business	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	and	i	have	to	say	,	for	one	,	i	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	at	the	progress	that	design	 ha 	 s 	 	made	since	the	first	ted	.	 thank 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
