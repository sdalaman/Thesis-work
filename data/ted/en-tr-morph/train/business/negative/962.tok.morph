i	want	you	to	take	a	trip	with	me	.
picture	 your 	 self 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	down	a	small	road	in	africa	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	drive	 a 	 long 	 	,	you	look	off	to	the	side	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	see	:	you	see	a	field	of	 grave 	 s 	 	.
and	you	stop	,	and	you	get	out	of	your	car	and	you	take	a	picture	.
and	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	town	,	and	you	 inquir 	 e 	 	,	``	what	's	going	on	here	?	``
and	people	are	 initi 	 ally 	 	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	tell	you	.
and	then	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	these	are	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	 death 	 s 	 	in	our	community	.	``
hiv	is	n't	like	other	medical	 condition 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 stigma 	 tizing 	 	.
people	are	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	talk	about	it	--	there	's	a	fear	 associate 	 d 	 	with	it	.
and	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	hiv	 to 	 day 	 	,	about	the	 death 	 s 	 	,	about	the	stigma	.
it	's	a	medical	story	,	but	more	than	that	,	it	's	a	social	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	map	 depict 	 s 	 	the	global	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	hiv	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 dis 	 proportion 	 ate 	 	share	of	the	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
there	are	33	million	people	living	with	hiv	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
of	these	,	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	,	22	million	are	living	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
there	are	1.4	million	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	in	low	-	and	middle	-	income	 count 	 ries 	 	living	with	hiv	and	of	these	,	90	percent	are	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
we	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 relat 	 ive 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	annual	 pregn 	 ancies 	 	and	hiv	-	positive	 mother 	 s 	 	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	--	a	large	country	--	each	year	,	7,000	 mother 	 s 	 	with	hiv	who	give	birth	to	a	child	.
but	you	go	to	rwanda	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	country	--	8,000	 mother 	 s 	 	with	hiv	who	are	 pregn 	 ant 	 	.
and	then	you	go	to	baragwanath	hospital	,	 out 	 side 	 	of	johannesburg	in	south	africa	,	and	8,000	hiv	-	positive	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	giving	birth	--	a	hospital	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	.
and	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	tip	of	an	 ice 	 berg 	 	that	when	you	 compar 	 e 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	here	to	south	africa	,	it	just	 pale 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	south	africa	,	each	year	300,000	 mother 	 s 	 	with	hiv	give	birth	to	children	.
so	we	talk	about	pmtct	,	and	we	refer	to	pmtct	,	 prevent 	 ion 	 	of	mother	to	child	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
i	think	there	's	an	assumption	 among 	 st 	 	most	people	in	the	public	that	if	a	mother	is	hiv	-	positive	,	she	's	going	to	infect	her	child	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
in	resource	-	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	,	with	all	the	 test 	 s 	 	and	 treat 	 ment 	 	we	 current 	 ly 	 	have	,	less	than	two	percent	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	born	hiv	-	positive	--	98	percent	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	born	hiv	-	negative	.
and	yet	,	the	 re 	 ality 	 	in	resource	-	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	,	in	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 test 	 s 	 	and	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	40	percent	--	40	percent	of	children	are	 infect 	 ed 	 	--	40	percent	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	two	percent	--	an	enormous	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
so	these	 program 	 s 	 	--	and	i	'm	going	to	refer	to	pmtct	 th 	 ough 	 	my	talk	--	these	 prevent 	 ion 	 	 program 	 s 	 	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	they	're	the	 test 	 s 	 	and	the	 drug 	 s 	 	that	we	give	to	 mother 	 s 	 	to	prevent	them	from	 infect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 medicine 	 s 	 	we	give	to	 mother 	 s 	 	to	keep	them	 health 	 y 	 	and	 al 	 ive 	 	to	raise	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
so	it	's	the	test	a	mother	 get 	 s 	 	when	she	 come 	 s 	 	in	.
it	's	the	 drug 	 s 	 	she	 receiv 	 es 	 	to	protect	the	baby	that	's	 in 	 side 	 	the	uterus	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	 deliver 	 y 	 	.
it	's	the	 gui 	 dance 	 	she	 get 	 s 	 	around	infant	 feed 	 ing 	 	and	 safe 	 r 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	.
it	's	an	entire	package	of	 service 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	since	the	 ad 	 vent 	 	of	 treat 	 ment 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	1990s	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	80	-	percent	decline	in	the	number	of	hiv	-	 infect 	 ed 	 	children	.
less	than	100	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	born	with	hiv	each	year	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	yet	,	still	,	over	400,000	children	are	born	every	year	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	with	hiv	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	1,100	children	 infect 	 ed 	 	each	day	--	1,100	children	each	day	,	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	hiv	.
and	where	do	they	come	from	?
well	,	less	than	one	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
one	,	on	average	,	 come 	 s 	 	from	europe	.
100	come	from	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
and	each	day	,	a	thousand	 bab 	 ies 	 	--	a	thousand	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	born	each	day	with	hiv	in	africa	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	look	at	the	 glob 	 e 	 	here	and	the	 dis 	 proportion 	 ate 	 	share	of	hiv	in	africa	.
and	let	's	look	at	 an 	 other 	 	map	.
and	here	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	see	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 dis 	 proportion 	 ate 	 	share	of	the	 number 	 s 	 	of	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
that	thin	 s 	 liver 	 	you	see	here	,	that	's	africa	.
and	it	's	the	same	with	 nurse 	 s 	 	.
the	truth	is	sub	-	saharan	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	24	percent	of	the	global	disease	burden	and	yet	 on 	 ly 	 	three	percent	of	the	world	's	health	care	 work 	 ers 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	do	n't	have	the	time	to	take	care	of	 patient 	 s 	 	.
a	nurse	in	a	 bus 	 y 	 	clinic	will	see	50	to	100	 patient 	 s 	 	in	a	day	,	which	 leav 	 es 	 	her	just	 minute 	 s 	 	per	patient	--	 minute 	 s 	 	per	patient	.
and	so	when	we	look	at	these	pmtct	 program 	 s 	 	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?
well	,	back	in	2001	,	when	there	was	just	a	simple	test	and	a	single	dose	of	a	drug	,	a	nurse	,	in	the	course	of	her	few	 minute 	 s 	 	with	a	patient	,	would	have	to	counsel	for	the	hiv	test	,	perform	the	hiv	test	,	explain	the	 result 	 s 	 	,	 dispens 	 e 	 	a	single	dose	of	the	drug	,	nevirapine	,	explain	how	to	take	it	,	discuss	infant	 feed 	 ing 	 	 option 	 s 	 	,	reinforce	infant	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	and	test	the	baby	--	in	 minute 	 s 	 	.
well	,	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	since	2001	,	we	've	got	new	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	new	 test 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	far	more	 success 	 ful 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	have	any	more	 nurse 	 s 	 	.
and	so	these	are	the	 test 	 s 	 	a	nurse	now	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	in	 t 	 hose 	 	same	few	 minute 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	possible	--	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
and	so	we	need	to	find	better	ways	of	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	care	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	a	 ma 	 ternal 	 	health	clinic	in	africa	--	 mother 	 s 	 	coming	,	 pregn 	 ant 	 	and	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
these	women	are	here	for	care	,	but	we	know	that	just	 do 	 ing 	 	a	test	,	just	giving	 some 	 one 	 	a	drug	,	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
 med 	 s 	 	do	n't	equal	medical	care	.
 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	do	n't	have	the	time	or	 skill 	 s 	 	to	tell	people	what	to	do	in	ways	they	understand	.
i	'm	a	doctor	--	i	tell	people	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	,	and	i	expect	them	to	follow	my	 gui 	 dance 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	a	doctor	;	i	went	to	harvard	--	but	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	,	if	i	tell	a	patient	,	``	you	should	have	 safe 	 r 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	.
you	should	 al 	 ways 	 	use	a	condom	,	``	and	yet	,	in	her	relationship	,	she	's	not	 empower 	 ed 	 	--	what	's	going	to	happen	?
if	i	tell	her	to	take	her	 medicine 	 s 	 	every	day	and	yet	,	no	one	in	the	 house 	 hold 	 	 know 	 s 	 	about	her	 ill 	 ness 	 	,	so	it	's	just	not	going	to	work	.
and	so	we	need	to	do	more	,	we	need	to	do	it	 different 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	to	do	it	in	ways	that	are	 afford 	 able 	 	and	 access 	 ible 	 	and	can	be	taken	to	scale	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	it	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
so	,	i	want	to	tell	you	a	story	--	i	want	to	take	you	on	a	little	trip	.
imagine	 your 	 self 	 	,	if	you	can	,	you	're	a	young	woman	in	africa	,	you	're	going	to	the	hospital	or	clinic	.
you	go	in	for	a	test	and	you	find	out	that	you	're	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	and	you	're	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	they	give	you	 an 	 other 	 	test	and	they	tell	you	you	're	hiv	-	positive	,	and	you	're	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	.
and	the	nurse	 take 	 s 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	a	room	,	and	she	 tell 	 s 	 	you	about	the	 test 	 s 	 	and	hiv	and	the	 medicine 	 s 	 	you	can	take	and	how	to	take	care	of	 your 	 self 	 	and	your	baby	,	and	you	hear	 non 	 e 	 	of	it	.
all	you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	is	,	``	i	'm	going	to	die	,	and	my	baby	is	going	to	die	.	``
and	then	you	're	out	on	the	street	,	and	you	do	n't	know	where	to	go	.
and	you	do	n't	know	who	you	can	talk	to	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	truth	is	,	hiv	is	so	 stigma 	 tizing 	 	that	if	you	partner	,	your	family	,	 any 	 one 	 	in	your	home	,	you	're	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 throw 	 n 	 	out	 with 	 out 	 	any	 mean 	 s 	 	of	support	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	face	and	story	of	hiv	in	africa	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	we	're	here	to	talk	about	possible	 solution 	 s 	 	and	some	good	news	.
and	i	want	to	change	the	story	a	little	bit	.
take	the	same	mother	,	and	the	nurse	,	after	she	 give 	 s 	 	her	her	test	,	 take 	 s 	 	her	to	a	room	.
the	door	 open 	 s 	 	and	there	's	a	room	full	of	 mother 	 s 	 	,	 mother 	 s 	 	with	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	and	they	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	they	're	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
they	're	 drink 	 ing 	 	tea	,	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
and	she	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	and	woman	 come 	 s 	 	up	to	her	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	welcome	to	 mother 	 s 	 2 	 mother 	 s 	 	.
have	a	seat	.	you	're	safe	here	.
we	're	all	hiv	-	positive	.
you	're	going	to	be	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	you	're	going	to	live	.
your	baby	is	going	to	be	hiv	-	negative	.	``
we	view	 mother 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	's	single	 great 	 est 	 	resource	.
 mother 	 s 	 	take	care	of	the	children	,	take	care	of	the	home	.
so	often	the	men	are	gone	.
they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	,	or	they	're	not	part	of	the	 house 	 hold 	 	.
our	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	 mother 	 s 	 2 	 mother 	 s 	 	,	 enlist 	 s 	 	women	with	hiv	 a 	 s 	 	care	 provide 	 rs 	 	.
we	 br 	 ing 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	who	have	hiv	,	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	through	these	pmtct	 program 	 s 	 	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	,	to	come	back	and	work	side	by	side	with	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	health	care	team	.
these	 mother 	 s 	 	,	we	call	them	mentor	 mother 	 s 	 	,	are	able	to	engage	women	who	,	just	like	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 pregn 	 ant 	 	with	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	have	found	out	about	 be 	 ing 	 	hiv	-	positive	,	who	need	support	and	education	.
and	they	support	them	around	the	 diagnos 	 is 	 	and	 educ 	 ate 	 	them	about	how	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 medicine 	 s 	 	,	how	to	take	care	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	how	to	take	care	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
consider	:	if	you	 need 	 ed 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	you	would	want	the	best	possible	technical	surgeon	,	right	?
but	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	understand	what	that	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	would	do	to	your	life	,	you	'd	like	to	engage	 some 	 one 	 	,	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	had	the	procedure	.
 patient 	 s 	 	are	 expert 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	experience	,	and	they	can	share	that	experience	with	 other 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	medical	care	that	 go 	 es 	 	beyond	just	 medicine 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 mother 	 s 	 	who	work	for	us	,	they	come	from	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	which	they	work	.
they	're	 hire 	 d 	 	--	they	're	paid	 a 	 s 	 	professional	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	health	care	 team 	 s 	 	,	just	like	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	.
and	we	open	bank	 account 	 s 	 	for	them	and	they	're	paid	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 account 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	money	's	 protect 	 ed 	 	;	the	men	ca	n't	take	it	away	from	them	.
they	go	through	two	to	three	 week 	 s 	 	of	 rigor 	 ous 	 	curriculum	-	based	education	,	training	.
now	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	--	they	too	get	trained	.
but	so	often	,	they	 on 	 ly 	 	get	trained	once	,	so	they	're	not	aware	of	new	 medicine 	 s 	 	,	new	 guide 	 lines 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	come	out	.
our	mentor	 mother 	 s 	 	get	trained	every	single	year	and	 re 	 trained 	 	.
and	so	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	--	they	look	up	to	them	 a 	 s 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	.
imagine	that	:	a	woman	,	a	 form 	 er 	 	patient	,	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	her	doctor	for	the	first	time	and	 educ 	 ate 	 	the	other	 patient 	 s 	 	that	she	's	taking	care	of	.
our	 organ 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	three	 goal 	 s 	 	.
the	first	,	to	prevent	mother	-	to	-	child	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
the	second	:	keep	 mother 	 s 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	keep	 mother 	 s 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	,	keep	the	children	 al 	 ive 	 	--	no	more	 orphan 	 s 	 	.
and	the	third	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	the	most	grand	,	is	to	find	ways	to	empower	women	,	 en 	 able 	 	them	to	fight	the	stigma	and	to	live	positive	and	productive	 live 	 s 	 	with	hiv	.
so	how	do	we	do	it	?
well	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	is	the	one	-	to	-	one	,	 see 	 ing 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	one	-	to	-	one	,	 educ 	 ating 	 	them	,	 support 	 ing 	 	them	,	 explain 	 ing 	 	how	they	can	take	care	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	go	beyond	that	;	we	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	the	 husband 	 s 	 	,	the	 partner 	 s 	 	.
in	africa	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	engage	men	.
men	are	not	 frequent 	 ly 	 	part	of	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	care	.
but	in	rwanda	,	in	one	country	,	they	've	got	a	policy	that	a	woman	ca	n't	come	for	care	 un 	 less 	 	she	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	father	of	the	baby	with	her	--	that	's	the	rule	.
and	so	the	father	and	the	mother	,	together	,	go	through	the	 counsel 	 ing 	 	and	the	 test 	 ing 	 	.
the	father	and	the	mother	,	together	,	they	get	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 break 	 ing 	 	through	the	stigma	.
 dis 	 closure 	 	is	so	central	to	 prevent 	 ion 	 	.
how	do	you	have	 safe 	 r 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	,	how	do	you	use	a	condom	 regular 	 ly 	 	if	there	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 dis 	 closure 	 	?
 dis 	 closure 	 	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	people	need	the	support	of	family	 member 	 s 	 	and	 friend 	 s 	 	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 medicine 	 s 	 	 regular 	 ly 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	work	in	 group 	 s 	 	.
now	the	 group 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	like	me	 lectur 	 ing 	 	,	but	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	women	,	they	come	together	--	under	the	support	and	 gui 	 dance 	 	of	our	mentor	 mother 	 s 	 	--	they	come	together	,	and	they	share	 the 	 ir 	 	personal	 experience 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	through	the	sharing	that	people	get	 tactic 	 s 	 	of	how	to	take	care	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	how	to	 dis 	 close 	 	how	to	take	 medicine 	 s 	 	.
and	then	there	's	the	community	 out 	 reach 	 	,	 engag 	 ing 	 	women	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
if	we	can	change	the	way	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	and	think	,	we	can	change	the	way	 commun 	 ities 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	and	think	.
and	if	we	can	change	 en 	 ough 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	we	can	change	national	 attitude 	 s 	 	.
we	can	change	national	 attitude 	 s 	 	to	women	and	national	 attitude 	 s 	 	to	hiv	.
the	 hard 	 est 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	around	stigma	 r 	 eduction 	 	.
we	have	the	 medicine 	 s 	 	,	we	have	the	 test 	 s 	 	,	but	how	do	you	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	stigma	?
and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	about	 dis 	 closure 	 	.
so	,	a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	one	of	the	mentor	 mother 	 s 	 	came	back	,	and	she	told	me	a	story	.
she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	one	of	the	 client 	 s 	 	to	go	to	the	home	of	the	client	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	client	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	the	mother	and	her	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	about	her	hiv	 stat 	 us 	 	,	and	she	was	 af 	 raid 	 	to	go	by	 her 	 self 	 	.
and	so	the	mentor	mother	went	 a 	 long 	 	with	.
and	the	patient	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	house	and	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	mother	and	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	,	``	i	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	tell	you	.	i	'm	hiv	-	positive	.	``
and	 every 	 body 	 	was	quiet	.
and	then	her	 old 	 est 	 	brother	stood	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	too	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	tell	you	.
i	'm	hiv	-	positive	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	to	tell	 every 	 body 	 	.	``
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	 old 	 er 	 	sister	stood	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	too	am	living	with	the	virus	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	.	``
and	then	her	 young 	 er 	 	brother	stood	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	positive	.
i	thought	you	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	throw	me	out	of	the	family	.	``
and	you	see	where	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	.
the	last	sister	stood	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	positive	.
i	thought	you	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	hate	me	.	``
and	there	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	all	of	them	together	for	the	first	time	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	experience	for	the	first	time	and	to	support	each	other	for	the	first	time	.
female	 nar 	 rator 	 	:	women	come	to	us	,	and	they	are	 cry 	 ing 	 	and	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
i	tell	them	my	story	,	that	i	am	hiv	-	positive	,	but	my	child	is	hiv	-	negative	.
i	tell	them	,	``	you	are	going	to	make	it	,	and	you	will	raise	a	 health 	 y 	 	baby	.	``
i	am	proof	that	there	is	hope	.
mitchell	besser	:	remember	the	 image 	 s 	 	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	of	how	few	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	there	are	in	africa	.
and	it	is	a	crisis	in	health	care	 system 	 s 	 	.
even	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	more	 test 	 s 	 	and	more	 drug 	 s 	 	,	we	ca	n't	reach	people	;	we	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 provide 	 rs 	 	.
so	we	talk	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	what	we	call	task	-	shifting	.
task	-	shifting	is	 tradition 	 ally 	 	when	you	take	health	care	 service 	 s 	 	from	one	 provide 	 r 	 	and	have	 an 	 other 	 	 provide 	 r 	 	do	it	.
 typical 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	doctor	giving	a	job	to	a	nurse	.
and	the	issue	in	africa	is	that	there	are	 few 	 er 	 	 nurse 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	than	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	and	so	we	need	to	find	new	paradigm	for	health	care	.
how	do	you	build	a	better	health	care	system	?
we	've	 chose 	 n 	 	to	 re 	 define 	 	the	health	care	system	 a 	 s 	 	a	doctor	,	a	nurse	and	a	mentor	mother	.
and	so	what	 nurse 	 s 	 	do	is	that	they	ask	the	mentor	 mother 	 s 	 	to	explain	how	to	take	the	 drug 	 s 	 	,	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	.
they	 deleg 	 ate 	 	education	about	infant	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	,	 safe 	 r 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	,	 action 	 s 	 	that	 nurse 	 s 	 	simple	just	do	n't	have	time	for	.
so	we	go	back	to	the	 prevent 	 ion 	 	of	mother	to	child	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
the	world	is	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	these	 program 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	bridge	to	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	 ma 	 ternal 	 	and	child	health	.
and	our	 organ 	 ization 	 	 help 	 s 	 	women	 a 	 cross 	 	that	bridge	.
the	care	 do 	 es 	 	n't	stop	when	the	baby	's	born	--	we	deal	with	the	 on 	 going 	 	health	of	the	mother	and	baby	,	 en 	 sur 	 ing 	 	that	they	live	 health 	 y 	 	,	 success 	 ful 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
our	 organ 	 ization 	 	 work 	 s 	 	on	three	 level 	 s 	 	.
the	first	,	at	the	patient	level	--	 mother 	 s 	 	and	 bab 	 ies 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	from	 get 	 ting 	 	hiv	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	 health 	 y 	 	to	raise	them	.
the	second	,	 commun 	 ities 	 	--	 empower 	 ing 	 	women	.
they	 be 	 come 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
they	change	the	way	 commun 	 ities 	 	think	--	we	need	to	change	 attitude 	 s 	 	to	hiv	.
we	need	to	change	 attitude 	 s 	 	to	women	in	africa	.
we	have	to	do	that	.
and	then	 re 	 work 	 	the	level	of	the	health	care	 system 	 s 	 	,	building	 strong 	 er 	 	health	care	 system 	 s 	 	.
our	health	care	 system 	 s 	 	are	broken	.
they	're	not	going	to	work	the	way	they	're	 current 	 ly 	 	designed	.
and	so	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	who	need	to	try	to	change	people	's	 behavior 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	the	 skill 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	have	the	time	--	our	mentor	 mother 	 s 	 	do	.
and	so	in	 re 	 defi 	 ning 	 	the	health	care	 team 	 s 	 	by	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	mentor	 mother 	 s 	 	in	,	we	can	do	that	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	the	program	in	capetown	,	south	africa	back	in	2001	.
it	was	at	that	point	,	just	the	spark	of	an	idea	.
 refer 	 encing 	 	steven	johnson	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	speech	 yester 	 day 	 	on	where	 idea 	 s 	 	come	from	,	i	was	in	the	shower	at	the	time	--	i	was	 al 	 one 	 	.
the	program	is	now	 work 	 ing 	 	in	nine	 count 	 ries 	 	,	we	have	670	program	 s 	 ites 	 	,	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	about	230,000	women	every	month	,	we	're	 employ 	 ing 	 	1,600	mentor	 mother 	 s 	 	,	and	last	year	,	they	 enroll 	 ed 	 	300,000	hiv	-	positive	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	and	 mother 	 s 	 	.
that	is	20	percent	of	the	global	hiv	-	positive	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	--	20	percent	of	the	world	.
what	's	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	is	how	simple	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	is	.
 mother 	 s 	 	with	hiv	 car 	 ing 	 	for	 mother 	 s 	 	with	hiv	.
past	 patient 	 s 	 	taking	care	of	present	 patient 	 s 	 	.
and	 empower 	 ment 	 	through	 employ 	 ment 	 	--	 reduc 	 ing 	 	stigma	.
female	 nar 	 rator 	 	:	there	is	hope	,	hope	that	one	day	we	 s 	 hall 	 	win	 th 	 is 	 	fight	against	hiv	and	 aid 	 s 	 	.
each	person	must	know	 the 	 ir 	 	hiv	 stat 	 us 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	hiv	-	negative	must	know	how	to	stay	negative	.
 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	hiv	-	 infect 	 ed 	 	must	know	how	to	take	care	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
hiv	-	positive	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	must	get	pmtct	 service 	 s 	 	in	order	to	have	hiv	-	negative	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	possible	,	if	we	each	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	fight	.
mb	:	simple	 solution 	 s 	 	to	complex	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 mother 	 s 	 	 car 	 ing 	 	for	 mother 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	.
thank	you	.
