i	'm	a	huge	 believ 	 er 	 	in	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	education	.
but	you	have	to	have	the	right	 tool 	 s 	 	.
if	i	'm	going	to	teach	my	daughter	about	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	not	going	to	give	her	a	 s 	 old 	 er 	 ing 	 	iron	.
and	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	she	 find 	 s 	 	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	 board 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	for	her	little	 hand 	 s 	 	.
so	my	 wonder 	 ful 	 	student	sam	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	look	at	the	most	tangible	thing	we	could	think	of	:	play	-	doh	.
and	so	we	 s 	 pent 	 	a	summer	looking	at	different	play	-	doh	 recipe 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 recipe 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	look	 re 	 ally 	 	familiar	to	any	of	you	who	have	made	 home 	 made 	 	play	-	dough	--	 pre 	 tty 	 	standard	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	in	your	kitchen	.
we	have	two	 favor 	 ite 	 	 recipe 	 s 	 	--	one	that	 ha 	 s 	 	these	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	and	a	second	that	had	sugar	 in 	 stead 	 	of	salt	.
and	they	're	great	.	we	can	make	great	little	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	with	these	.
but	the	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	thing	about	them	is	when	we	put	them	together	.
you	see	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 salt 	 y 	 	play	-	doh	?
well	,	it	 conduct 	 s 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	new	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	regular	play	-	doh	that	you	buy	at	the	store	 conduct 	 s 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	and	high	school	physics	 teacher 	 s 	 	have	used	that	for	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	our	 home 	 made 	 	play	-	dough	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	half	the	 resist 	 ance 	 	of	commercial	play	-	doh	.
and	that	sugar	dough	?
well	it	's	150	 time 	 s 	 	more	resistant	to	electric	current	than	that	salt	dough	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
well	it	 mean 	 s 	 	if	you	them	together	you	 sudden 	 ly 	 	have	 circuit 	 s 	 	--	 circuit 	 s 	 	that	the	most	creative	,	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	 hand 	 s 	 	can	build	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
and	so	i	want	to	do	a	little	demo	for	you	.
so	if	i	take	 th 	 is 	 	salt	dough	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	like	the	play	-	dough	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	made	 a 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	i	plug	it	in	--	it	's	a	two	-	lead	 batt 	 ery 	 	pack	,	simple	 batt 	 ery 	 	pack	,	you	can	buy	them	at	radio	 s 	 hack 	 	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 any 	 where 	 	else	--	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	then	light	 thing 	 s 	 	up	.
but	if	any	of	you	have	 stud 	 ied 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	create	a	short	circuit	.
if	i	push	these	together	,	the	light	 turn 	 s 	 	off	.
right	,	the	current	 want 	 s 	 	to	run	through	the	play	-	dough	,	not	through	that	led	.
if	i	 separat 	 e 	 	them	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	have	some	light	.
well	now	if	i	take	that	sugar	dough	,	the	sugar	dough	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	to	conduct	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
it	's	like	a	wall	to	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
if	i	place	that	between	,	now	all	the	dough	is	 touch 	 ing 	 	,	but	if	i	stick	that	light	back	in	,	i	have	light	.
in	fact	,	i	could	even	add	some	 move 	 ment 	 	to	my	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	.
if	i	want	a	 s 	 pinning 	 	tail	,	let	's	grab	a	motor	,	put	some	play	-	dough	on	it	,	stick	it	on	and	we	have	 s 	 pinning 	 	.
and	once	you	have	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	we	can	make	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	circuit	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	our	sushi	circuit	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	with	 kid 	 s 	 	.
i	plug	in	 aga 	 in 	 	the	power	to	it	.
and	now	i	can	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	parallel	and	 s 	 eries 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	.
i	can	start	 plug 	 ging 	 	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 light 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 electric 	 al 	 	load	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	i	put	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 light 	 s 	 	and	then	add	a	motor	?
it	'll	 d 	 im 	 	.
we	can	even	add	 micro 	 processor 	 s 	 	and	have	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 put 	 	and	create	 squish 	 y 	 	sound	music	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
you	could	do	parallel	and	 s 	 eries 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	using	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	in	your	home	kitchen	.
we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	 electric 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	lab	.
we	have	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	it	's	all	there	.	these	are	the	home	 recipe 	 s 	 	.
we	've	got	some	 video 	 s 	 	.	you	can	make	them	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 un 	 	since	we	put	them	up	to	see	where	these	have	gone	.
we	've	had	a	mom	in	utah	who	used	them	with	her	 kid 	 s 	 	,	to	a	science	 research 	 er 	 	in	the	u.k.	,	and	curriculum	 develop 	 ers 	 	in	hawaii	.
so	i	would	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	all	to	grab	some	play	-	doh	,	grab	some	salt	,	grab	some	sugar	and	start	 play 	 ing 	 	.
we	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	think	of	our	kitchen	 a 	 s 	 	an	 electric 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	lab	or	little	 kid 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	circuit	 design 	 ers 	 	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	.
have	 f 	 un 	 	.	thank	you	.
