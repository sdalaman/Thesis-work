there	's	an	ancient	and	universal	 con 	 cept 	 	that	 word 	 s 	 	have	power	,	that	 spell 	 s 	 	exist	,	and	that	if	we	could	 on 	 ly 	 	pronounce	the	right	 word 	 s 	 	,	then	--	 who 	 o 	 osh 	 	--	you	know	,	an	 avalanch 	 e 	 	would	come	and	wipe	out	the	 hob 	 bits 	 	,	right	?	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	idea	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 laz 	 y 	 	,	like	the	sorcerer	's	apprentice	,	or	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	computer	 programm 	 er 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	idea	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 tract 	 ion 	 	with	us	.
we	love	the	idea	that	 word 	 s 	 	,	when	 pronounce 	 d 	 	--	they	're	just	little	more	than	 pur 	 e 	 	information	,	but	they	evoke	some	physical	action	in	the	real	world	that	 help 	 s 	 	us	do	work	.
and	so	,	of	course	,	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 programm 	 able 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	and	 robot 	 s 	 	around	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	easy	thing	to	picture	.
so	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?
raise	your	right	hand	.	ok	.	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	do	n't	know	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?	raise	your	left	hand	.
so	that	's	great	.	so	that	was	too	easy	.
you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 secure 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	ok	?
so	now	,	the	thing	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	different	kind	of	spell	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	computer	program	made	of	 zero 	 s 	 	and	 one 	 s 	 	.
it	can	be	 pronounce 	 d 	 	on	a	computer	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	we	can	write	it	in	a	high	-	level	language	.
a	computer	 magic 	 ian 	 	can	write	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
it	can	be	 compil 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	 in 	 to 	 	 zero 	 s 	 	and	 one 	 s 	 	--	and	 pronounce 	 d 	 	by	a	computer	.
and	that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	:	these	high	-	level	 language 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 compil 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	,	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	,	you	do	n't	need	a	computer	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	spell	.	in	fact	,	what	you	can	do	at	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	level	is	that	if	you	encode	information	--	you	encode	a	spell	or	program	 a 	 s 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	--	then	physics	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	interpret	that	information	and	run	a	program	.	that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 protein 	 s 	 	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	 am 	 ino 	 	acid	sequence	 get 	 s 	 	 pronounce 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	,	these	little	 letter 	 s 	 	are	 stick 	 y 	 	for	each	other	.
it	 collapse 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	three	-	dimensional	shape	that	 turn 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 nano 	 machine 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cut 	 s 	 	dna	.
and	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	if	you	change	the	sequence	,	you	change	the	three	-	dimensional	 fold 	 ing 	 	.
you	get	now	a	dna	 staple 	 r 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.	these	are	the	kind	of	 mole 	 cular 	 	 program 	 s 	 	that	we	want	to	be	able	to	write	,	but	the	problem	is	,	we	do	n't	know	the	machine	language	of	 protein 	 s 	 	.	we	do	n't	have	a	 compil 	 er 	 	for	 protein 	 s 	 	.
so	i	've	 join 	 ed 	 	a	growing	band	of	people	that	try	to	make	 mole 	 cular 	 	 spell 	 s 	 	using	dna	.	we	use	dna	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
it	's	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	handle	.	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	understand	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
we	understand	it	so	well	,	in	fact	,	that	we	think	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	write	 programm 	 ing 	 	 language 	 s 	 	for	dna	and	have	 mole 	 cular 	 	 compil 	 ers 	 	.
so	then	,	we	think	we	can	do	that	.	and	my	first	question	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	or	one	of	my	 question 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	was	how	can	you	make	an	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	shape	or	pattern	out	of	dna	?	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	use	a	type	of	dna	origami	,	where	you	take	a	long	strand	of	dna	and	fold	it	 in 	 to 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	shape	or	pattern	you	might	want	.
so	here	's	a	shape	.	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	about	a	year	in	my	home	,	in	my	 under 	 wear 	 	,	 cod 	 ing 	 	,	like	linus	[	torvalds	]	,	in	that	picture	before	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	program	 take 	 s 	 	a	shape	,	 s 	 pit 	 s 	 	out	250	dna	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
these	short	dna	 sequence 	 s 	 	are	what	are	going	to	fold	the	long	strand	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	shape	that	we	want	to	make	.	so	you	 s 	 end 	 	an	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	with	these	 sequence 	 s 	 	in	it	to	a	company	,	and	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	--	the	company	 pronounce 	 s 	 	them	on	a	dna	 synthesize 	 r 	 	.
it	's	a	machine	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 photo 	 cop 	 ier 	 	.	and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	they	take	your	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	and	every	letter	in	your	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	,	they	replace	with	30	-	atom	cluster	--	one	for	each	letter	,	a	,	t	,	c	,	and	g	in	dna	.	they	string	them	up	in	the	right	sequence	,	and	then	they	 s 	 end 	 	them	back	to	you	via	fedex	.
so	you	get	250	of	these	in	the	mail	in	little	 tube 	 s 	 	.
i	mix	them	together	,	add	a	little	bit	of	salt	water	,	and	then	add	 th 	 is 	 	long	strand	i	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	about	,	that	i	've	 stole 	 n 	 	from	a	virus	.	and	then	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	you	heat	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	up	to	about	 boil 	 ing 	 	.	you	cool	it	down	to	room	temperature	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	 t 	 hose 	 	short	 strand 	 s 	 	,	they	do	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	thing	:	each	one	of	them	 bind 	 s 	 	that	long	strand	in	one	place	,	and	then	 ha 	 s 	 	a	second	half	that	 bind 	 s 	 	that	long	strand	in	a	 di 	 stant 	 	place	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	long	strand	close	together	so	that	they	stick	together	.
and	so	the	net	effect	of	all	250	of	these	 strand 	 s 	 	is	to	fold	the	long	strand	 in 	 to 	 	the	shape	that	you	're	looking	for	.
it	'll	approximate	that	shape	.	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	real	in	the	test	tube	.
in	each	little	drop	of	water	you	get	50	billion	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
you	can	look	with	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	and	see	them	on	a	surface	.
and	the	neat	thing	is	that	if	you	change	the	sequence	and	change	the	spell	,	you	just	change	the	sequence	of	the	 staple 	 s 	 	.
you	can	make	a	molecule	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	,	you	know	,	he	 like 	 s 	 	to	hang	out	with	his	 bud 	 dies 	 	,	right	.
and	a	lot	of	them	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
if	you	change	the	spell	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	change	the	sequence	 aga 	 in 	 	.
you	get	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	130	 nano 	 meter 	 	 triangle 	 s 	 	.	if	you	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	can	get	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.	so	on	a	 rect 	 angle 	 	you	can	paint	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	north	and	south	america	,	or	the	 word 	 s 	 	,	``	dna	.	``
so	that	's	dna	origami	.	that	's	one	way	.	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	ways	of	 cast 	 ing 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 spell 	 s 	 	using	dna	.
what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	do	in	the	end	is	learn	how	to	program	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	so	that	we	can	build	 any 	 thing 	 	,	right	?
we	want	to	be	able	to	build	 techno 	 logical 	 	 artifact 	 s 	 	that	are	 may 	 be 	 	good	for	the	world	.	we	want	to	learn	how	to	build	 bio 	 logical 	 	 artifact 	 s 	 	,	like	people	and	 whale 	 s 	 	and	 tree 	 s 	 	.
and	if	it	's	the	case	that	we	can	reach	that	level	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	if	our	ability	to	program	 molecule 	 s 	 	 get 	 s 	 	to	be	that	good	,	then	that	will	 tru 	 ly 	 	be	magic	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
