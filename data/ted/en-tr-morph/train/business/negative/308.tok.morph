 a 	 s 	 	a	 clergy 	 man 	 	,	you	can	imagine	how	out	of	place	i	feel	.
i	feel	like	a	fish	out	of	water	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	an	owl	out	of	the	air	.
i	was	 preach 	 ing 	 	in	san	jose	some	time	ago	,	and	my	friend	mark	kvamme	,	who	 help 	 ed 	 	 introduc 	 e 	 	me	to	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	 br 	 ought 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	ceos	and	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	some	of	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	here	in	the	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	to	have	 break 	 fast 	 	with	me	,	or	i	with	them	.
and	i	was	so	 stimul 	 ated 	 	.
and	had	 s 	 uch 	 	--	it	was	an	eye	-	 open 	 ing 	 	experience	to	hear	them	talk	about	the	world	that	is	yet	to	come	through	technology	and	science	.
i	know	that	we	're	near	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	and	some	of	you	may	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	why	they	have	a	speaker	from	the	field	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
richard	can	answer	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	made	that	decision	.
but	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	was	on	an	 elev 	 ator 	 	in	philadelphia	,	coming	down	.
i	was	to	address	a	 con 	 ference 	 	at	a	hotel	.
and	on	that	 elev 	 ator 	 	a	man	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	hear	billy	graham	is	 stay 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	hotel	.	``
and	 an 	 other 	 	man	 look 	 ed 	 	in	my	direction	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	there	he	is	.	he	's	on	 th 	 is 	 	 elev 	 ator 	 	with	us	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	man	 look 	 ed 	 	me	up	and	down	for	about	10	 second 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	,	what	an	 anti 	 climax 	 	!	``
i	hope	that	you	wo	n't	feel	that	these	few	 moment 	 s 	 	with	me	is	not	a	--	is	an	 anti 	 climax 	 	,	after	all	these	tremendous	 talk 	 s 	 	that	you	've	heard	,	and	 address 	 es 	 	,	which	i	intend	to	listen	to	every	one	of	them	.
but	i	was	on	an	 air 	 plane 	 	in	the	east	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	the	man	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	aisle	from	me	was	the	mayor	of	charlotte	,	north	carolina	.
his	name	was	john	belk	.	some	of	you	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	him	.
and	there	was	a	drunk	man	on	there	,	and	he	got	up	out	of	his	seat	two	or	three	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	he	was	making	 every 	 body 	 	 up 	 set 	 	by	what	he	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
and	he	was	 s 	 lap 	 ping 	 	the	 steward 	 es 	 s 	 	and	 pinch 	 ing 	 	her	 a 	 s 	 	she	went	by	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	was	 up 	 set 	 	with	him	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	john	belk	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	know	who	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	?	``
and	the	man	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	who	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	billy	graham	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	do	n't	say	!	``
and	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	put	her	there	!	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	your	 sermon 	 s 	 	have	 certain 	 ly 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	me	.	``
and	i	suppose	that	that	's	true	with	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.
i	know	that	 a 	 s 	 	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	 peer 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	some	of	it	here	 to 	 night 	 	,	i	would	like	to	live	in	that	age	and	see	what	is	going	to	be	.
but	i	wo	n't	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	80	 year 	 s 	 	old	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 eight 	 ieth 	 	year	,	and	i	know	that	my	time	is	brief	.
i	have	 phleb 	 itis 	 	at	the	moment	,	in	both	 leg 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	the	reason	that	i	had	to	have	a	little	help	in	 get 	 ting 	 	up	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	parkinson	's	disease	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	,	and	some	other	 problem 	 s 	 	that	i	wo	n't	talk	about	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	first	time	that	we	've	had	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	revolution	.
we	've	had	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	one	that	i	want	to	talk	about	.
in	one	generation	,	the	nation	of	the	people	of	israel	had	a	tremendous	and	 dramat 	 ic 	 	change	that	made	them	a	great	power	in	the	near	east	.
a	man	by	the	name	of	david	came	to	the	 thr 	 one 	 	,	and	king	david	 be 	 came 	 	one	of	the	great	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	his	generation	.
he	was	a	man	of	tremendous	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
he	had	the	favor	of	god	with	him	.
he	was	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	poet	,	with	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	in	battle	and	conflict	that	people	 stud 	 y 	 	even	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	about	two	centuries	before	david	,	the	hittites	had	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	secret	of	 s 	 melt 	 ing 	 	and	 process 	 ing 	 	of	iron	,	and	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	that	skill	spread	.
but	they	would	n't	allow	the	israelis	to	look	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	or	to	have	any	.
but	david	 change 	 d 	 	all	of	that	,	and	he	 introduc 	 ed 	 	the	iron	age	to	israel	.
and	the	 b 	 ible 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	david	laid	up	great	 store 	 s 	 	of	iron	,	and	which	 archaeo 	 logists 	 	have	found	,	that	in	present	-	day	palestine	,	there	are	 evidence 	 s 	 	of	that	generation	.
now	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 crud 	 e 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	made	of	 stick 	 s 	 	and	 stone 	 s 	 	,	israel	now	had	iron	 plow 	 s 	 	,	and	 sick 	 les 	 	,	and	 hoe 	 s 	 	and	 militar 	 y 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	course	of	one	generation	,	israel	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	iron	,	in	some	ways	,	had	an	impact	a	little	bit	like	the	 micro 	 chip 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	had	on	our	generation	.
and	david	found	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	technology	could	not	solve	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	still	left	.
and	they	're	still	with	us	,	and	you	have	n't	 solve 	 d 	 	them	,	and	i	have	n't	heard	 any 	 body 	 	here	speak	to	that	.
how	do	we	solve	these	three	 problem 	 s 	 	that	i	'd	like	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	?
the	first	one	that	david	saw	was	human	 e 	 vil 	 	.
where	 do 	 es 	 	it	come	from	?
how	do	we	solve	it	?
over	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	in	the	psalms	,	which	gladstone	 s 	 aid 	 	was	the	 great 	 est 	 	book	in	the	world	,	david	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	the	 e 	 vil 	 s 	 	of	the	human	race	.
and	yet	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	he	 re 	 store 	 s 	 	my	soul	.	``
have	you	ever	thought	about	what	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	we	are	?
on	one	hand	,	we	can	 prob 	 e 	 	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 secret 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	 dramat 	 ically 	 	push	back	the	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	of	technology	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	 demonst 	 rates 	 	.

but	on	the	other	hand	,	 some 	 thing 	 	is	wrong	.
our	 battle 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	our	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	are	on	a	 front 	 ier 	 	now	,	 al 	 most 	 	ready	to	go	to	war	with	 ir 	 aq 	 	.

why	do	we	have	these	 war 	 s 	 	in	every	generation	,	and	in	every	part	of	the	world	?
and	 revolution 	 s 	 	?
we	ca	n't	get	 a 	 long 	 	with	other	people	,	even	in	our	own	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.

our	problem	is	that	we	are	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	our	creator	,	which	we	call	god	,	and	we	need	to	have	our	 soul 	 s 	 	 resto 	 red 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	god	can	do	.

blaise	pascal	 ask 	 ed 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	question	in	seventeenth	-	century	france	.
pascal	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	architect	of	modern	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
he	was	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	scientist	at	the	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	even	 a 	 s 	 	a	teenager	.
he	is	 view 	 ed 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	founder	of	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	,	and	a	creator	of	the	first	model	of	a	computer	.
and	of	course	,	you	are	all	familiar	with	the	computer	language	named	for	him	.
pascal	 explore 	 d 	 	in	depth	our	human	 dilemma 	 s 	 	of	 e 	 vil 	 	,	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	death	.
he	was	 astound 	 ed 	 	at	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 consider 	 ing 	 	:	that	people	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 height 	 s 	 	in	science	,	the	 art 	 s 	 	and	human	enterprise	,	yet	they	 al 	 so 	 	are	full	of	anger	,	 hypo 	 cri 	 s 	 y 	 	and	have	--	and	self	-	 hatred 	 s 	 	.
pascal	saw	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	 remark 	 able 	 	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 gen 	 ius 	 	and	self	-	delusion	.
on	november	23	,	1654	,	pascal	had	a	 pro 	 found 	 	religious	experience	.
he	wrote	in	his	journal	these	 word 	 s 	 	:	``	i	submit	 my 	 self 	 	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	,	to	jesus	christ	,	my	 redeem 	 er 	 	.	``
a	french	historian	 s 	 aid 	 	,	two	centuries	 lat 	 er 	 	,	``	seldom	 ha 	 s 	 	so	 might 	 y 	 	an	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	 submit 	 ted 	 	with	 s 	 uch 	 	 humil 	 ity 	 	to	the	 author 	 ity 	 	of	jesus	christ	.	``
pascal	came	to	 believ 	 e 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	love	and	the	grace	of	god	could	 br 	 ing 	 	us	back	 in 	 to 	 	 harmon 	 y 	 	,	but	he	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	his	own	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	and	 failure 	 s 	 	could	be	 forgive 	 n 	 	,	and	that	when	he	 di 	 ed 	 	he	would	go	to	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	heaven	.
he	 experience 	 d 	 	it	in	a	way	that	went	beyond	scientific	 observ 	 ation 	 	and	reason	.
it	was	he	who	 pen 	 ned 	 	the	well	-	known	 word 	 s 	 	,	``	the	heart	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	which	reason	 know 	 s 	 	not	of	.	``
 equal 	 ly 	 	well	known	is	pascal	's	 wage 	 r 	 	.
 essential 	 ly 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	if	you	bet	on	god	,	and	open	 your 	 self 	 	to	his	love	,	you	lose	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	even	if	you	're	wrong	.
but	if	 in 	 stead 	 	you	bet	that	there	is	no	god	,	then	you	can	lose	it	all	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	life	and	the	life	to	come	.	``
for	pascal	,	scientific	knowledge	 pal 	 ed 	 	 be 	 side 	 	the	knowledge	of	god	.
the	knowledge	of	god	was	far	beyond	 any 	 thing 	 	that	ever	 cross 	 ed 	 	his	mind	.
he	was	ready	to	face	him	when	he	 di 	 ed 	 	at	the	age	of	39	.
king	david	lived	to	be	70	,	a	long	time	in	his	era	.
yet	he	too	had	to	face	death	,	and	he	wrote	these	 word 	 s 	 	:	``	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	walk	through	the	 val 	 ley 	 	of	the	shadow	of	death	,	i	will	fear	no	 e 	 vil 	 	,	for	you	are	with	me	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	david	's	answer	to	three	 dilemma 	 s 	 	of	 e 	 vil 	 	,	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	death	.
it	can	be	 your 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	seek	the	living	god	and	allow	him	to	fill	your	life	and	give	you	hope	for	the	future	.
when	i	was	17	 year 	 s 	 	of	age	,	i	was	born	and	 rear 	 ed 	 	on	a	farm	in	north	carolina	.
i	 milk 	 ed 	 	 cow 	 s 	 	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	had	to	milk	the	same	 cow 	 s 	 	every	 even 	 ing 	 	when	i	came	home	from	school	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	20	of	them	that	i	had	--	that	i	was	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	,	and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	the	farm	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	keep	up	with	my	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
i	did	n't	make	good	 grade 	 s 	 	in	high	school	.
i	did	n't	make	them	in	college	,	 un 	 til 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	my	heart	.
one	day	,	i	was	 face 	 d 	 	face	-	to	-	face	with	christ	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	am	the	way	,	the	truth	and	the	life	.	``
can	you	imagine	that	?	``	i	am	the	truth	.
i	'm	the	 embodi 	 ment 	 	of	all	truth	.	``
he	was	a	liar	.
or	he	was	 insan 	 e 	 	.
or	he	was	what	he	 claim 	 ed 	 	to	be	.
which	was	he	?
i	had	to	make	that	decision	.
i	could	n't	prove	it	.
i	could	n't	take	it	to	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	and	experiment	with	it	.
but	by	faith	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	him	,	and	he	came	 in 	 to 	 	my	heart	and	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	.
and	now	i	'm	ready	,	when	i	hear	that	call	,	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	presence	of	god	.
thank	you	,	and	god	bless	all	of	you	.
thank	you	for	the	privilege	.	it	was	great	.
