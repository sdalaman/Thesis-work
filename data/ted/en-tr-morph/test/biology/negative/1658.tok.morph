human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	start	 put 	 ting 	 	each	other	 in 	 to 	 	boxes	the	second	that	they	see	each	other	--	is	that	person	 danger 	 ous 	 	?	are	they	 attract 	 ive 	 	?
are	they	a	potential	mate	?	are	they	a	potential	 network 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	?
we	do	 th 	 is 	 	little	 interrog 	 ation 	 	when	we	meet	people	to	make	a	mental	resume	for	them	.
what	's	your	name	?	where	are	you	from	?
how	old	are	you	?	what	do	you	do	?
then	we	get	more	personal	with	it	.
have	you	ever	had	any	 disease 	 s 	 	?
have	you	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 divorce 	 d 	 	?

what	are	you	 in 	 to 	 	?	who	are	you	 in 	 to 	 	?
what	gender	do	you	like	to	sleep	with	?
i	get	it	.
we	are	 neuro 	 logically 	 	 hard 	 wired 	 	to	seek	out	people	like	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	start	 form 	 ing 	 	 cl 	 ique 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	old	 en 	 ough 	 	to	know	what	 accept 	 ance 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	like	.
we	bond	together	based	on	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	--	music	 pre 	 ference 	 	,	race	,	gender	,	the	block	that	we	grew	up	on	.
we	seek	out	 environment 	 s 	 	that	reinforce	our	personal	 choice 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	just	the	question	``	what	do	you	do	?	``
can	feel	like	 some 	 body 	 	's	 open 	 ing 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	box	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	to	 squeez 	 e 	 	 your 	 self 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	i	've	found	,	are	too	 limit 	 ing 	 	.
the	boxes	are	too	narrow	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	can	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
so	here	's	a	 dis 	 claim 	 er 	 	about	me	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	before	we	get	too	deep	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	grew	up	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 shelter 	 ed 	 	environment	.
i	was	raised	in	 down 	 town 	 	manhattan	in	the	early	1980s	,	two	 block 	 s 	 	from	the	 epi 	 center 	 	of	 pun 	 k 	 	music	.
i	was	 shield 	 ed 	 	from	the	 pain 	 s 	 	of	 big 	 otry 	 	and	the	social	 restrict 	 ions 	 	of	a	 religious 	 ly 	 	-	based	 up 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	.
where	i	come	from	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	a	drag	 que 	 en 	 	or	a	radical	 think 	 er 	 	or	a	performance	artist	of	some	kind	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	the	 weird 	 o 	 	.
it	was	an	 un 	 orthodox 	 	 up 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	new	york	,	you	learn	how	to	trust	your	own	 instinct 	 s 	 	,	you	learn	how	to	go	with	your	own	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	when	i	was	six	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	boy	.
i	went	to	school	one	day	and	the	 kid 	 s 	 	would	n't	let	me	play	 basket 	 ball 	 	with	them	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	would	n't	let	 girl 	 s 	 	play	.
so	i	went	home	,	and	i	 s 	 have 	 d 	 	my	head	,	and	i	came	back	the	next	day	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	a	boy	.	``
i	mean	,	who	 know 	 s 	 	,	right	?
when	you	're	six	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	do	that	.
i	did	n't	want	 any 	 one 	 	to	know	that	i	was	a	girl	,	and	they	did	n't	.
i	 ke 	 pt 	 	up	the	 char 	 ade 	 	for	eight	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	me	when	i	was	11	.
i	was	 play 	 ing 	 	a	kid	named	walter	in	a	movie	 call 	 ed 	 	``	julian	po	.	``
i	was	a	little	street	tough	that	 follow 	 ed 	 	christian	slater	around	and	 badge 	 red 	 	him	.
see	,	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	child	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	which	 double 	 d 	 	up	the	 layer 	 s 	 	of	the	performance	of	my	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	no	one	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	girl	 re 	 ally 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	a	boy	.
in	fact	,	no	one	in	my	life	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	was	a	girl	--	not	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	at	school	,	not	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	not	the	 director 	 s 	 	that	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	.
 kid 	 s 	 	would	often	come	up	to	me	in	class	and	grab	me	by	the	throat	to	check	for	an	adam	's	apple	or	grab	my	crotch	to	check	what	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	.
when	i	would	go	to	the	 bath 	 room 	 	,	i	would	turn	my	 shoe 	 s 	 	around	in	the	 stall 	 s 	 	so	that	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	i	was	 pe 	 e 	 ing 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	.
at	 sleep 	 over 	 s 	 	i	would	have	panic	 attack 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	break	it	to	 girl 	 s 	 	that	they	did	n't	want	to	kiss	me	 with 	 out 	 	 out 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
it	's	worth	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	that	i	did	n't	hate	my	body	or	my	 genital 	 ia 	 	.
i	did	n't	feel	like	i	was	in	the	wrong	body	.
i	felt	like	i	was	 perform 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	elaborate	act	.
i	would	n't	have	 qual 	 ified 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 trans 	 gender 	 	.
if	my	family	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	had	 be 	 en 	 	the	kind	of	people	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	therapy	,	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	have	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	gender	 dy 	 s 	 morphic 	 	and	put	me	on	 hormone 	 s 	 	to	 stav 	 e 	 	off	puberty	.
but	in	my	 part 	 icular 	 	case	,	i	just	 wok 	 e 	 	up	one	day	when	i	was	14	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	girl	 aga 	 in 	 	.
puberty	had	hit	,	and	i	had	no	idea	what	 be 	 ing 	 	a	girl	 me 	 ant 	 	,	and	i	was	ready	to	figure	out	who	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	.
when	a	kid	 behav 	 es 	 	like	i	did	,	they	do	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	have	to	come	out	,	right	?
no	one	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
but	i	was	n't	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	define	 my 	 self 	 	by	my	 parent 	 s 	 	.
when	i	was	15	,	and	i	 call 	 ed 	 	my	father	to	tell	him	that	i	had	 fall 	 en 	 	in	love	,	it	was	the	last	thing	on	either	of	our	 mind 	 s 	 	to	discuss	what	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	of	the	fact	that	my	first	love	was	a	girl	.
three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	fell	in	love	with	a	man	,	 n 	 either 	 	of	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 batt 	 ed 	 	an	 eye 	 lash 	 	either	.
see	,	it	's	one	of	the	great	 bless 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	my	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 orthodox 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	that	i	was	n't	ever	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	define	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	any	one	thing	at	any	point	.
i	was	just	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	be	me	,	growing	and	changing	in	every	moment	.
so	four	,	 al 	 most 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 pro 	 position 	 	8	,	the	great	marriage	 e 	 quality 	 	debate	,	was	raising	a	lot	of	dust	around	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
and	at	the	time	,	 get 	 ting 	 	married	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
but	i	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	the	fact	that	america	,	a	country	with	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 tar 	 nish 	 ed 	 	civil	 right 	 s 	 	record	,	could	be	 repeat 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	so	 blatant 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	remember	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	how	 interest 	 ing 	 	it	was	that	the	 separat 	 ion 	 	of	church	and	state	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	 geo 	 graphical 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	 through 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	between	 place 	 s 	 	where	people	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	it	and	 place 	 s 	 	where	people	did	n't	.
and	then	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	was	 draw 	 ing 	 	 geo 	 graphical 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	around	me	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	war	with	two	disparate	 side 	 s 	 	,	i	,	by	default	,	fell	on	team	 ga 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	was	n't	100	percent	straight	.
at	the	time	i	was	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	emerge	from	 th 	 is 	 	eight	-	year	personal	 ident 	 ity 	 	crisis	zigzag	that	saw	me	go	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	boy	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	awkward	girl	that	 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	boy	in	girl	's	 clothe 	 s 	 	to	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	super	 skim 	 py 	 	,	over	-	 compens 	 ating 	 	,	boy	-	chasing	 girl 	 y 	 	-	girl	to	 final 	 ly 	 	just	a	 hesit 	 ant 	 	exploration	of	what	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	,	a	 tomboy 	 ish 	 	girl	who	 like 	 d 	 	both	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	person	.
i	had	 s 	 pent 	 	a	year	 photograph 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	generation	of	 girl 	 s 	 	,	much	like	 my 	 self 	 	,	who	fell	kind	of	between	-	the	-	lines	--	 girl 	 s 	 	who	 skateboard 	 ed 	 	but	did	it	in	 lac 	 y 	 	 under 	 wear 	 	,	 girl 	 s 	 	who	had	 boy 	 s 	 	'	 hair 	 cut 	 s 	 	but	 wo 	 re 	 	 girl 	 y 	 	nail	polish	,	 girl 	 s 	 	who	had	 eye 	 shadow 	 	to	match	 the 	 ir 	 	 scrap 	 ed 	 	 knee 	 s 	 	,	 girl 	 s 	 	who	 like 	 d 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 boy 	 s 	 	who	all	 like 	 d 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	who	all	 hat 	 ed 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 box 	 ed 	 	in	to	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	 love 	 d 	 	these	people	,	and	i	 admire 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	,	but	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	world	 out 	 side 	 	of	our	 utopia 	 n 	 	bubble	 explode 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 rag 	 ing 	 	 debate 	 s 	 	where	 pun 	 d 	 it 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 like 	 ning 	 	our	love	to	 best 	 ial 	 ity 	 	on	national	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	 roll 	 ed 	 	in	over	me	that	i	was	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	,	and	in	my	own	home	country	,	based	on	one	facet	of	my	character	.
i	was	 legal 	 ly 	 	and	 in 	 disput 	 ably 	 	a	second	-	class	citizen	.
i	was	not	an	activist	.
i	wave	no	 flag 	 s 	 	in	my	own	life	.
but	i	was	 plague 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	question	:	how	could	 any 	 one 	 	vote	to	strip	the	 right 	 s 	 	of	the	vast	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	people	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	based	on	one	element	of	 the 	 ir 	 	character	?
how	could	they	say	that	we	 a 	 s 	 	a	group	 we 	 re 	 	not	 de 	 serv 	 ing 	 	of	equal	 right 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	else	?
 we 	 re 	 	we	even	a	group	?	what	group	?
and	had	these	people	ever	even	 conscious 	 ly 	 	met	a	victim	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	?
did	they	know	who	they	 we 	 re 	 	 vot 	 ing 	 	against	and	what	the	impact	was	?
and	then	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	if	they	could	look	 in 	 to 	 	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	the	people	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 cast 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	second	-	class	 citizen 	 ship 	 	it	might	make	it	 hard 	 er 	 	for	them	to	do	.
it	might	give	them	pause	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	i	could	n't	get	20	million	people	to	the	same	 d 	 inner 	 	party	,	so	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	a	way	where	i	could	 introduc 	 e 	 	them	to	each	other	 photograph 	 ically 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	artifice	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	 light 	 ing 	 	,	or	 with 	 out 	 	any	 manipul 	 ation 	 	of	any	kind	on	my	part	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	a	photograph	you	can	examine	a	lion	's	 whisk 	 ers 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	fear	of	him	 rip 	 ping 	 	your	face	off	.
for	me	,	 photograph 	 y 	 	is	not	just	about	 ex 	 posing 	 	film	,	it	's	about	 ex 	 posing 	 	the	 view 	 er 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	new	,	a	place	they	have	n't	gone	before	,	but	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	to	people	that	they	might	be	 af 	 raid 	 	of	.

so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	make	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 portrait 	 s 	 	,	 mug 	 shot 	 s 	 	if	you	will	.
and	i	 bas 	 ically 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	photograph	 any 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	that	was	not	100	percent	straight	,	which	,	if	you	do	n't	know	,	is	a	 limit 	 less 	 	number	of	people	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 under 	 taking 	 	,	and	to	do	it	we	 need 	 ed 	 	some	help	.
so	i	ran	out	in	the	freezing	cold	,	and	i	 photograph 	 ed 	 	every	single	person	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	could	get	to	in	february	of	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	i	took	 t 	 hose 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	and	i	went	to	the	hrc	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	for	some	help	.
and	they	funded	two	 week 	 s 	 	of	 shoot 	 ing 	 	in	new	york	.
and	then	we	made	 th 	 is 	 	.

self	evident	 truth 	 s 	 	is	a	 photograph 	 ic 	 	record	of	lgbtq	america	 to 	 day 	 	.
my	aim	is	to	take	a	simple	portrait	of	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	 any 	 thing 	 	other	than	100	percent	straight	or	 feel 	 s 	 	like	they	fall	in	the	lgbtq	spectrum	in	any	way	.

of	course	,	in	my	 travel 	 s 	 	i	met	people	who	 legal 	 ly 	 	 divorce 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	for	 be 	 ing 	 	other	than	straight	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	met	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	southern	baptists	who	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	 church 	 es 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	child	was	a	lesbian	.
 spark 	 ing 	 	 empath 	 y 	 	had	 be 	 come 	 	the	 back 	 bone 	 	of	self	evident	 truth 	 s 	 	.
but	here	's	what	i	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	learn	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	:	self	evident	 truth 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 er 	 ase 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	us	.
in	fact	,	on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	it	 high 	 light 	 s 	 	them	.
it	 present 	 s 	 	,	not	just	the	 complex 	 ities 	 	found	in	a	 process 	 ion 	 	of	different	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 complex 	 ities 	 	found	 with 	 in 	 	each	individual	person	.
it	was	n't	that	we	had	too	 man 	 y 	 	boxes	,	it	was	that	we	had	too	few	.
at	some	point	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	my	mission	to	photograph	``	 ga 	 y 	 s 	 	``	was	 inherent 	 ly 	 	 flaw 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	million	different	 sha 	 de 	 s 	 	of	 ga 	 y 	 	.
here	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	,	and	i	had	 perpetu 	 ated 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	thing	i	had	 s 	 pent 	 	my	life	 try 	 ing 	 	to	avoid	--	yet	 an 	 other 	 	box	.
at	some	point	i	 add 	 ed 	 	a	question	to	the	 re 	 lease 	 	form	that	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	 quant 	 ify 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	a	scale	of	one	to	100	percent	 ga 	 y 	 	.
and	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	existential	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	 un 	 fold 	 	in	front	of	me	.
people	did	n't	know	what	to	do	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	with	the	option	before	.
can	you	 quant 	 ify 	 	your	 open 	 ness 	 	?
once	they	got	over	the	shock	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	by	and	large	people	 opt 	 ed 	 	for	 some 	 where 	 	between	70	to	95	percent	or	the	3	to	20	percent	 mark 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	who	 opt 	 ed 	 	for	a	100	percent	one	or	the	other	,	but	i	found	that	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	proportion	of	people	identified	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	much	more	 nuance 	 d 	 	.
i	found	that	most	people	fall	on	a	spectrum	of	what	i	have	come	to	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	``	 gr 	 ey 	 	.	``
let	me	be	clear	 th 	 ough 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	--	in	no	way	am	i	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 pre 	 ference 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	.
and	i	am	not	even	going	to	address	the	issue	of	choice	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 imper 	 ative 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	any	of	you	happen	to	be	of	the	belief	that	sexual	 orient 	 ation 	 	is	a	choice	,	i	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	go	out	and	try	to	be	 gr 	 ey 	 	.
i	'll	take	your	picture	just	for	 try 	 ing 	 	.
what	i	am	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	is	that	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	not	one	-	dimensional	.
the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	take	from	the	 percent 	 age 	 	system	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	if	you	have	 ga 	 y 	 	people	over	here	and	you	have	straight	people	over	here	,	and	while	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	most	people	identify	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 where 	 	 close 	 r 	 	to	one	 bin 	 ary 	 	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	vast	spectrum	of	people	that	exist	in	between	.
and	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 s 	 	is	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	one	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	you	pass	a	law	that	 allow 	 s 	 	a	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	to	fire	an	 employ 	 ee 	 	for	 homo 	 sexual 	 	behavior	,	where	 exact 	 ly 	 	do	you	draw	the	line	?
is	it	over	here	,	by	the	people	who	have	had	one	or	two	 hetero 	 sexual 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	so	far	?
or	is	it	over	here	by	the	people	who	have	 on 	 ly 	 	had	one	or	two	 homo 	 sexual 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	thus	far	?
where	 exact 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	one	 be 	 come 	 	a	second	-	class	citizen	?
 an 	 other 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	my	project	and	my	 travel 	 s 	 	is	just	what	a	poor	 bind 	 ing 	 	agent	sexual	 orient 	 ation 	 	is	.
after	 travel 	 ing 	 	so	much	and	 meet 	 ing 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	let	me	tell	you	,	there	are	just	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 jerk 	 s 	 	and	 sweet 	 heart 	 s 	 	and	 democrat 	 s 	 	and	republicans	and	 jo 	 ck 	 s 	 	and	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	and	every	other	 polar 	 ization 	 	you	can	possibly	think	of	 with 	 in 	 	the	lgbt	community	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	 with 	 in 	 	the	human	race	.
 a 	 side 	 	from	the	fact	that	we	play	with	one	legal	hand	 ti 	 ed 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	our	 back 	 s 	 	,	and	once	you	get	past	the	 share 	 d 	 	narrative	of	prejudice	and	struggle	,	just	 be 	 ing 	 	other	than	straight	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	mean	that	we	have	 any 	 thing 	 	in	common	.
so	in	the	 end 	 less 	 	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	of	 face 	 s 	 	that	self	evident	 truth 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 hope 	 fully 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	more	and	more	 platform 	 s 	 	,	bus	 shelter 	 s 	 	,	 bill 	 board 	 s 	 	,	facebook	 page 	 s 	 	,	screen	 saver 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	in	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 process 	 ion 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 use 	 ful 	 	will	begin	to	happen	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	these	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	these	 bin 	 aries 	 	,	these	over	-	 simpl 	 ified 	 	boxes	will	begin	to	 be 	 come 	 	 use 	 less 	 	and	they	'll	begin	to	fall	away	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	they	 de 	 scribe 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	we	see	and	no	one	that	we	know	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	we	are	.
what	we	see	are	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 multi 	 plicit 	 y 	 	.
and	 see 	 ing 	 	them	 make 	 s 	 	it	 hard 	 er 	 	to	 den 	 y 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	.
at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 l 	 east 	 	i	hope	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	 hard 	 er 	 	to	 den 	 y 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	human	 right 	 s 	 	.
so	is	it	me	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	that	you	would	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 den 	 y 	 	the	right	to	housing	,	the	right	to	adopt	children	,	the	right	to	marriage	,	the	 free 	 dom 	 	to	shop	here	,	live	here	,	buy	here	?

it	's	too	late	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 al 	 ready 	 	am	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 ready 	 	are	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 al 	 ways 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
so	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	greet	us	 a 	 s 	 	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	greet	us	 a 	 s 	 	your	fellow	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	period	.
