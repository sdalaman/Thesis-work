the	theme	of	my	talk	 to 	 day 	 	is	,	``	be	an	artist	,	right	now	.	``
most	people	,	when	 th 	 is 	 	subject	is	 br 	 ought 	 	up	,	get	tense	and	resist	it	:	``	art	 do 	 es 	 	n't	feed	me	,	and	right	now	i	'm	 bus 	 y 	 	.
i	have	to	go	to	school	,	get	a	job	,	 s 	 end 	 	my	 kid 	 s 	 	to	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	...	``	you	think	,	``	i	'm	too	 bus 	 y 	 	.	i	do	n't	have	time	for	art	.	``
there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	ca	n't	be	 artist 	 s 	 	right	now	.
do	n't	they	just	pop	 in 	 to 	 	your	head	?
there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	ca	n't	be	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	're	not	 s 	 ure 	 	why	we	should	be	.
we	do	n't	know	why	we	should	be	 artist 	 s 	 	,	but	we	have	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	ca	n't	be	.
why	do	people	 instant 	 ly 	 	resist	the	idea	of	 associ 	 ating 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	art	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	you	think	art	is	for	the	 great 	 ly 	 	 gift 	 ed 	 	or	for	the	 thorough 	 ly 	 	and	 professional 	 ly 	 	trained	.
and	some	of	you	may	think	you	've	 s 	 tray 	 ed 	 	too	far	from	art	.
well	you	might	have	,	but	i	do	n't	think	so	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	theme	of	my	talk	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	are	all	born	 artist 	 s 	 	.
if	you	have	 kid 	 s 	 	,	you	know	what	i	mean	.
 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	do	is	art	.
they	draw	with	 cray 	 on 	 s 	 	on	the	wall	.
they	dance	to	son	dam	bi	's	dance	on	tv	,	but	you	ca	n't	even	call	it	son	dam	bi	's	dance	--	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	 kid 	 s 	 	'	own	dance	.
so	they	dance	a	strange	dance	and	inflict	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	on	 every 	 one 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	art	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	can	bear	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	they	practice	 s 	 uch 	 	art	all	day	long	,	people	 honest 	 ly 	 	get	a	little	 tire 	 d 	 	around	 kid 	 s 	 	.
 kid 	 s 	 	will	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	perform	 mono 	 drama 	 s 	 	--	 play 	 ing 	 	house	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	a	 mono 	 drama 	 	or	a	play	.
and	some	 kid 	 s 	 	,	when	they	get	a	bit	 old 	 er 	 	,	start	to	lie	.
 usual 	 ly 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	remember	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	 the 	 ir 	 	kid	lies	.
they	're	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
``	now	you	're	 show 	 ing 	 	your	true	 color 	 s 	 	,	``	mom	 say 	 s 	 	.	she	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	why	 do 	 es 	 	he	take	after	his	dad	?	``
she	 question 	 s 	 	him	,	``	what	kind	of	a	person	are	you	going	to	be	?	``
but	you	should	n't	worry	.
the	moment	 kid 	 s 	 	start	to	lie	is	the	moment	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	they	did	n't	see	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	moment	.
 parent 	 s 	 	should	 celebr 	 ate 	 	.
``	hurray	!	my	boy	 final 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	lie	!	``
all	right	!	it	 call 	 s 	 	for	 celebr 	 ation 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	kid	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	mom	,	guess	what	?	i	met	an	alien	on	my	way	home	.	``
then	a	typical	mom	 respond 	 s 	 	,	``	stop	that	 non 	 sense 	 	.	``
now	,	an	ideal	parent	is	 some 	 one 	 	who	 respond 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	 re 	 ally 	 	?	an	alien	,	huh	?	what	did	it	look	like	?	did	it	say	 any 	 thing 	 	?
where	did	you	meet	it	?	``	``	um	,	in	front	of	the	 super 	 market 	 	.	``
when	you	have	a	conversation	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	kid	 ha 	 s 	 	to	come	up	with	the	next	thing	to	say	to	be	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	what	he	 start 	 ed 	 	.
soon	,	a	story	 develop 	 s 	 	.
of	course	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 infant 	 ile 	 	story	,	but	 think 	 ing 	 	up	one	sentence	after	the	next	is	the	same	thing	a	professional	writer	like	me	 do 	 es 	 	.
in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	they	are	not	different	.
roland	barthes	once	 s 	 aid 	 	of	flaubert	's	 novel 	 s 	 	,	``	flaubert	did	not	write	a	novel	.
he	 mere 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	one	sentence	after	 an 	 other 	 	.
the	 ero 	 s 	 	between	 sentence 	 s 	 	,	that	is	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	flaubert	's	novel	.	``
that	's	right	--	a	novel	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	is	writing	one	sentence	,	then	,	 with 	 out 	 	 viol 	 ating 	 	the	scope	of	the	first	one	,	writing	the	next	sentence	.
and	you	 continu 	 e 	 	to	make	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	sentence	:	``	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	gregor	samsa	was	 wa 	 king 	 	up	from	 anx 	 ious 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	,	he	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	in	his	bed	he	had	 be 	 en 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 monstr 	 ous 	 	 ver 	 min 	 ous 	 	bug	.	``
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	the	first	sentence	of	franz	kafka	's	``	the	 meta 	 morpho 	 sis 	 	.	``
writing	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 un 	 just 	 ifiable 	 	sentence	and	 continu 	 ing 	 	in	order	to	 just 	 ify 	 	it	,	kafka	's	work	 be 	 came 	 	the	 master 	 piece 	 	of	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
kafka	did	not	show	his	work	to	his	father	.
he	was	not	on	good	 term 	 s 	 	with	his	father	.
on	his	own	,	he	wrote	these	 sentence 	 s 	 	.
had	he	 show 	 n 	 	his	father	,	``	my	boy	 ha 	 s 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	lost	it	,	``	he	would	've	thought	.
and	that	's	right	.	art	is	about	going	a	little	nuts	and	 just 	 ifying 	 	the	next	sentence	,	which	is	not	much	different	from	what	a	kid	 do 	 es 	 	.
a	kid	who	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 start 	 ed 	 	to	lie	is	taking	the	first	step	 a 	 s 	 	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.
 kid 	 s 	 	do	art	.
they	do	n't	get	 tire 	 d 	 	and	they	have	 f 	 un 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
i	was	in	jeju	 is 	 land 	 	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	ago	.
when	 kid 	 s 	 	are	on	the	beach	,	most	of	them	love	 play 	 ing 	 	in	the	water	.
but	some	of	them	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	the	sand	,	making	 mountain 	 s 	 	and	 sea 	 s 	 	--	well	,	not	 sea 	 s 	 	,	but	different	 thing 	 s 	 	--	people	and	 dog 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
but	 parent 	 s 	 	tell	them	,	``	it	will	all	be	 wash 	 ed 	 	away	by	the	 wave 	 s 	 	.	``
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 use 	 less 	 	.
there	's	no	need	.
but	 kid 	 s 	 	do	n't	mind	.
they	have	 f 	 un 	 	in	the	moment	and	they	keep	 play 	 ing 	 	in	the	sand	.
 kid 	 s 	 	do	n't	do	it	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 one 	 	told	them	to	.
they	are	n't	told	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	or	 any 	 one 	 	,	they	just	do	it	.
when	you	 we 	 re 	 	little	,	i	bet	you	 s 	 pent 	 	time	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	pleasure	of	primitive	art	.
when	i	ask	my	 student 	 s 	 	to	write	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	moment	,	 man 	 y 	 	write	about	an	early	 art 	 istic 	 	experience	they	had	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	.
 learn 	 ing 	 	to	play	piano	for	the	first	time	and	 play 	 ing 	 	four	 hand 	 s 	 	with	a	friend	,	or	 perform 	 ing 	 	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 s 	 kit 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	looking	like	 idiot 	 s 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
or	the	moment	you	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	first	film	you	shot	with	an	old	camera	.
they	talk	about	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 experience 	 s 	 	.
you	must	have	had	 s 	 uch 	 	a	moment	.
in	that	moment	,	art	 make 	 s 	 	you	happy	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	work	.
work	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	you	happy	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	?	 most 	 ly 	 	it	's	tough	.
the	french	writer	michel	tournier	 ha 	 s 	 	a	famous	 say 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	a	bit	 mis 	 ch 	 iev 	 ous 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
``	work	is	against	human	nature	.	the	proof	is	that	it	 make 	 s 	 	us	 tire 	 d 	 	.	``
right	?	why	would	work	tire	us	if	it	's	in	our	nature	?
 play 	 ing 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	tire	us	.
we	can	play	all	night	long	.
if	we	work	 over 	 night 	 	,	we	should	be	paid	for	 over 	 time 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ti 	 ring 	 	and	we	feel	fatigue	.
but	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	they	do	art	for	 f 	 un 	 	.	it	's	 play 	 ing 	 	.
they	do	n't	draw	to	sell	the	work	to	a	client	or	play	the	piano	to	earn	money	for	the	family	.
of	course	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	who	had	to	.
you	know	 th 	 is 	 	 gentle 	 man 	 	,	right	?
he	had	to	tour	around	europe	to	support	his	family	--	wolfgang	amadeus	mozart	--	but	that	was	centuries	ago	,	so	we	can	make	him	an	exception	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	at	some	point	our	art	--	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 joy 	 ful 	 	 pa 	 s 	 time 	 	--	 end 	 s 	 	.
 kid 	 s 	 	have	to	go	to	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	,	to	school	,	do	 home 	 work 	 	and	of	course	they	take	piano	or	ballet	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	,	but	they	are	n't	 f 	 un 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
you	're	told	to	do	it	and	there	's	 com 	 petition 	 	.	how	can	it	be	 f 	 un 	 	?
if	you	're	in	 element 	 ary 	 	school	and	you	still	draw	on	the	wall	,	you	'll	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	get	in	trouble	with	your	mom	.
 be 	 side 	 s 	 	,	if	you	 continu 	 e 	 	to	act	like	an	artist	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 old 	 er 	 	,	you	'll	 increasing 	 ly 	 	feel	pressure	--	people	will	question	your	 action 	 s 	 	and	ask	you	to	act	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
here	's	my	story	:	i	was	an	eighth	 grad 	 er 	 	and	i	 enter 	 ed 	 	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	contest	at	school	in	gyeongbokgung	.
i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	my	best	,	and	my	teacher	came	around	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
``	i	'm	 draw 	 ing 	 	 diligent 	 ly 	 	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	.
``	why	are	you	using	 on 	 ly 	 	black	?	``
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	i	was	 eager 	 ly 	 	 color 	 ing 	 	the	 sketch 	 book 	 	in	black	.
and	i	 explain 	 ed 	 	,	``	it	's	a	dark	night	and	a	crow	is	 per 	 ch 	 ing 	 	on	a	branch	.	``
then	my	teacher	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 re 	 ally 	 	?	well	,	young	-	ha	,	you	may	not	be	good	at	 draw 	 ing 	 	but	you	have	a	talent	for	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	.	``
or	so	i	 wish 	 ed 	 	.
``	now	you	'll	get	it	,	you	 ra 	 scal 	 	!	``	was	the	 respons 	 e 	 	.
``	you	'll	get	it	!	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
you	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	draw	the	 pa 	 lace 	 	,	the	gyeonghoeru	,	etc	.	,	but	i	was	 color 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	in	black	,	so	he	 drag 	 ged 	 	me	out	of	the	group	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	 girl 	 s 	 	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	so	i	was	 utter 	 ly 	 	 mort 	 ified 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	my	 explan 	 ations 	 	or	 excuse 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	heard	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	got	it	big	time	.
if	he	was	an	ideal	teacher	,	he	would	have	 respond 	 ed 	 	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	before	,	``	young	-	ha	may	not	have	a	talent	for	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	but	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	gift	for	making	up	 st 	 ories 	 	,	``	and	he	would	have	 encourag 	 ed 	 	me	.
but	 s 	 uch 	 	a	teacher	is	seldom	found	.
 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	grew	up	and	went	to	europe	's	 gall 	 eries 	 	--	i	was	a	university	student	--	and	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 fair 	 	.
look	what	i	found	.
 work 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 we 	 re 	 	hung	in	basel	while	i	was	 punish 	 ed 	 	and	stood	in	front	of	the	 pa 	 lace 	 	with	my	 draw 	 ing 	 	in	my	mouth	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	look	just	like	 wall 	 paper 	 	?
 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	,	i	 lat 	 er 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	is	n't	 explain 	 ed 	 	by	a	 lam 	 e 	 	story	like	mine	.
no	 crow 	 s 	 	are	 br 	 ought 	 	up	.
most	of	the	 work 	 s 	 	have	no	title	,	untitled	.
 any 	 ways 	 	,	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	in	the	20th	century	is	about	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	weird	and	 fill 	 ing 	 	the	void	with	 explan 	 ation 	 	and	 interpret 	 ation 	 	--	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	.
of	course	,	my	work	was	 ver 	 y 	 	amateur	,	but	let	's	turn	to	more	famous	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	picasso	's	.
he	 s 	 tuck 	 	 handle 	 bar 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	bike	seat	and	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	bull	's	head	.	``	 sound 	 s 	 	convincing	,	right	?
next	,	a	 urin 	 al 	 	was	 place 	 d 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	side	and	 call 	 ed 	 	``	fountain	``	.
that	was	duchamp	.
so	 fill 	 ing 	 	the	gap	between	 explan 	 ation 	 	and	a	weird	act	with	 st 	 ories 	 	--	that	's	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	what	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	is	all	about	.
picasso	even	made	the	 state 	 ment 	 	,	``	i	draw	not	what	i	see	but	what	i	think	.	``
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	i	did	n't	have	to	draw	gyeonghoeru	.
i	wish	i	 k 	 new 	 	what	picasso	 s 	 aid 	 	back	then	.	i	could	have	 argu 	 ed 	 	better	with	my	teacher	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	little	 artist 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	us	are	 choke 	 d 	 	to	death	before	we	get	to	fight	against	the	 oppress 	 ors 	 	of	art	.
they	get	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	.
that	's	our	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	little	 artist 	 s 	 	get	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	,	 banish 	 ed 	 	or	even	 kill 	 ed 	 	?
our	 art 	 istic 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	go	away	.
we	want	to	express	,	to	reveal	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	but	with	the	artist	dead	,	the	 art 	 istic 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	 reveal 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	dark	form	.
in	 kara 	 oke 	 	 bar 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 al 	 ways 	 	people	who	 s 	 ing 	 	``	she	's	gone	``	or	``	hotel	california	,	``	 mim 	 ing 	 	the	guitar	 riff 	 s 	 	.
 usual 	 ly 	 	they	sound	awful	.	awful	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
some	people	turn	 in 	 to 	 	 rock 	 ers 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
or	some	people	dance	in	 club 	 s 	 	.
people	who	would	have	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	end	up	 troll 	 ing 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	all	night	long	.
that	's	how	a	writing	talent	 reveal 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	on	the	dark	side	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	see	 dad 	 s 	 	get	more	 excit 	 ed 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	legos	or	 put 	 ting 	 	together	plastic	 robot 	 s 	 	.
they	go	,	``	do	n't	touch	it	.	 d 	 addy 	 	will	do	it	for	you	.	``
the	kid	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	lost	interest	and	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	but	the	dad	 al 	 one 	 	 build 	 s 	 	 castle 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	 art 	 istic 	 	 impulse 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	us	are	 suppress 	 ed 	 	,	not	gone	.
but	they	can	often	reveal	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 negative 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	form	of	 jealous 	 y 	 	.
you	know	the	song	``	i	would	love	to	be	on	tv	``	?	why	would	we	love	it	?
tv	is	full	of	people	who	do	what	we	 wish 	 ed 	 	to	do	,	but	never	got	to	.
they	dance	,	they	act	--	and	the	more	they	do	,	they	are	 praise 	 d 	 	.
so	we	start	to	 en 	 vy 	 	them	.
we	 be 	 come 	 	 dictator 	 s 	 	with	a	remote	and	start	to	 critic 	 ize 	 	the	people	on	tv	.
``	he	just	ca	n't	act	.	``	``	you	call	that	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	?	she	ca	n't	hit	the	 note 	 s 	 	.	``
we	 eas 	 ily 	 	say	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	get	jealous	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 e 	 vil 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	little	 artist 	 s 	 	pent	up	 in 	 side 	 	us	.
that	's	what	i	think	.
what	should	we	do	then	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	that	's	right	.
right	now	,	we	need	to	start	our	own	art	.
right	 th 	 is 	 	minute	,	we	can	turn	off	tv	,	log	off	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	get	up	and	start	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
where	i	teach	 student 	 s 	 	in	drama	school	,	there	's	a	course	 call 	 ed 	 	dramatics	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	course	,	all	 student 	 s 	 	must	put	on	a	play	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 act 	 ing 	 	 major 	 s 	 	are	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	act	.
they	can	write	the	play	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	and	the	 writer 	 s 	 	may	work	on	stage	art	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	stage	art	 major 	 s 	 	may	 be 	 come 	 	 act 	 ors 	 	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	you	put	on	a	show	.
 student 	 s 	 	at	first	wonder	 whet 	 her 	 	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	it	,	but	 lat 	 er 	 	they	have	so	much	 f 	 un 	 	.	i	 rare 	 ly 	 	see	 any 	 one 	 	who	is	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	play	.
in	school	,	the	 militar 	 y 	 	or	even	in	a	mental	institution	,	once	you	make	people	do	it	,	they	enjoy	it	.
i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	happen	in	the	 arm 	 y 	 	--	 man 	 y 	 	people	had	 f 	 un 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 play 	 s 	 	.
i	have	 an 	 other 	 	experience	:	in	my	writing	class	,	i	give	 student 	 s 	 	a	special	 assign 	 ment 	 	.
i	have	 student 	 s 	 	like	you	in	the	class	--	 man 	 y 	 	who	do	n't	major	in	writing	.
some	major	in	art	or	music	and	think	they	ca	n't	write	.
so	i	give	them	blank	 sheet 	 s 	 	of	paper	and	a	theme	.
it	can	be	a	simple	theme	:	write	about	the	most	 un 	 fortunate 	 	experience	in	your	 child 	 hood 	 	.
there	's	one	condition	:	you	must	write	like	crazy	.	like	crazy	!
i	walk	around	and	 encourag 	 e 	 	them	,	``	come	on	,	come	on	!	``	they	have	to	write	like	crazy	for	an	hour	or	two	.
they	 on 	 ly 	 	get	to	think	for	the	first	five	 minute 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	i	make	them	write	like	crazy	is	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	write	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thought 	 s 	 	cross	your	mind	,	the	 art 	 istic 	 	devil	 creep 	 s 	 	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	devil	will	tell	you	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	why	you	ca	n't	write	:	``	people	will	laugh	at	you	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	good	writing	!
what	kind	of	sentence	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	look	at	your	 hand 	 writing 	 	!	``
it	will	say	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	have	to	run	fast	so	the	devil	ca	n't	catch	up	.
the	 re 	 ally 	 	good	writing	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	my	class	was	not	from	the	 assign 	 ments 	 	with	a	long	 dead 	 line 	 	,	but	from	the	40-	to	60	-	minute	crazy	writing	 student 	 s 	 	did	in	front	of	me	with	a	pencil	.
the	 student 	 s 	 	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	trance	.
after	30	or	40	 minute 	 s 	 	,	they	write	 with 	 out 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	what	they	're	writing	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	the	 nag 	 ging 	 	devil	 disappear 	 s 	 	.
so	i	can	say	 th 	 is 	 	:	it	's	not	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	why	one	ca	n't	be	an	artist	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	the	one	reason	one	must	be	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	 artist 	 s 	 	.
why	we	can	not	be	 some 	 thing 	 	is	not	 import 	 ant 	 	.
most	 artist 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	one	reason	.
when	we	put	the	devil	in	our	heart	to	sleep	and	start	our	own	art	,	 ene 	 mies 	 	appear	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
 most 	 ly 	 	,	they	have	the	 face 	 s 	 	of	our	 parent 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	look	like	our	 spouse 	 s 	 	,	but	they	are	not	your	 parent 	 s 	 	or	 spouse 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 devil 	 s 	 	.	 devil 	 s 	 	.
they	came	to	earth	 brief 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	to	stop	you	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 art 	 istic 	 	,	from	 be 	 coming 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	.
and	they	have	a	magic	question	.
when	we	say	,	``	i	think	i	'll	try	 act 	 ing 	 	.	there	's	a	drama	school	in	the	community	center	,	``	or	``	i	'd	like	to	learn	italian	 song 	 s 	 	,	``	they	ask	,	``	oh	,	 yea 	 h 	 	?	a	play	?	what	for	?	``
the	magic	question	is	,	``	what	for	?	``
but	art	is	not	for	 any 	 thing 	 	.
art	is	the	ultimate	goal	.
it	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	our	 soul 	 s 	 	and	 make 	 s 	 	us	live	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	.
it	 help 	 s 	 	us	express	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	be	happy	 with 	 out 	 	the	help	of	alcohol	or	 drug 	 s 	 	.
so	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 pragmat 	 ic 	 	question	,	we	need	to	be	bold	.
``	well	,	just	for	the	 f 	 un 	 	of	it	.	sorry	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	 f 	 un 	 	 with 	 out 	 	you	,	``	is	what	you	should	say	.	``	i	'll	just	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	do	it	 any 	 way 	 	.	``
the	ideal	future	i	imagine	is	where	we	all	have	 multi 	 ple 	 	 ident 	 ities 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	of	which	is	an	artist	.
once	i	was	in	new	york	and	got	in	a	cab	.	i	took	the	 back 	 seat 	 	,	and	in	front	of	me	i	saw	 some 	 thing 	 	related	to	a	play	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	driver	,	``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	his	profile	.	``	then	what	are	you	?	``	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	.	``	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
he	was	a	 cab 	 by 	 	and	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	what	 role 	 s 	 	do	you	 usual 	 ly 	 	play	?	``
he	 proud 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	he	 play 	 ed 	 	king	lear	.
king	lear	.
``	who	is	it	that	can	tell	me	who	i	am	?	``	--	a	great	line	from	king	lear	.
that	's	the	world	i	dream	of	.
 some 	 one 	 	is	a	 golf 	 er 	 	by	day	and	writer	by	night	.
or	a	 cab 	 by 	 	and	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	a	 bank 	 er 	 	and	a	 paint 	 er 	 	,	 secret 	 ly 	 	or	 public 	 ly 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 art 	 s 	 	.
in	1990	,	martha	graham	,	the	legend	of	modern	dance	,	came	to	korea	.
the	great	artist	,	then	in	her	90s	,	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	gimpo	 air 	 port 	 	and	a	 report 	 er 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	a	typical	question	:	``	what	do	you	have	to	do	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	great	 danc 	 er 	 	?
any	 ad 	 vice 	 	for	 aspir 	 ing 	 	korean	 danc 	 ers 	 	?	``
now	,	she	was	the	master	.	 th 	 is 	 	photo	was	taken	in	1948	and	she	was	 al 	 ready 	 	a	 celebr 	 ated 	 	artist	.
in	1990	,	she	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
and	here	's	what	she	 answer 	 ed 	 	:	``	just	do	it	.	``
 w 	 ow 	 	.	i	was	 touch 	 ed 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 word 	 s 	 	and	she	left	the	 air 	 port 	 	.	that	's	it	.
so	what	should	we	do	now	?
let	's	be	 artist 	 s 	 	,	right	now	.	right	away	.	how	?
just	do	it	!
thank	you	.
