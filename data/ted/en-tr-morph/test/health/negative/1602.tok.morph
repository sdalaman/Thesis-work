good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.	so	magic	is	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	way	for	 stay 	 ing 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	 re 	 ality 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	to	make	possible	 to 	 day 	 	what	science	will	make	a	 re 	 ality 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	cyber	-	 magic 	 ian 	 	,	i	combine	 element 	 s 	 	of	illusion	and	science	to	give	us	a	feel	of	how	future	 techno 	 logies 	 	might	be	 experience 	 d 	 	.
you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	all	heard	of	google	's	project	glass	.
it	's	new	technology	.	you	look	through	them	and	the	world	you	see	is	 augment 	 ed 	 	with	data	:	 name 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	,	 monument 	 s 	 	,	 building 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	one	day	even	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 strange 	 rs 	 	that	pass	you	on	the	street	.
so	these	are	my	illusion	 glass 	 es 	 	.
they	're	a	little	 big 	 ger 	 	.	they	're	a	prototype	.
and	when	you	look	through	them	,	you	get	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	mind	of	the	cyber	-	 illusion 	 ist 	 	.
let	me	show	you	what	i	mean	.

all	right	.	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	mark	.
and	let	's	put	it	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	deck	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	middle	,	and	let	's	get	 start 	 ed 	 	.
