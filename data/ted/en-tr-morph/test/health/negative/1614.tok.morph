so	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	small	good	thing	for	my	wife	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	me	to	stand	here	,	the	fame	,	the	money	i	got	out	of	it	.
so	what	i	did	,	i	'd	gone	back	to	my	early	marriage	 day 	 s 	 	.
what	you	did	in	the	early	marriage	 day 	 s 	 	,	you	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	impress	your	wife	.	i	did	the	same	.
on	that	occasion	,	i	found	my	wife	 carry 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	saw	.	``	what	is	that	?	``	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
my	wife	 re 	 plied 	 	,	``	 non 	 e 	 	of	your	business	.	``
then	,	 be 	 ing 	 	her	husband	,	i	ran	 be 	 hind 	 	her	and	saw	she	had	a	nasty	rag	cloth	.
i	do	n't	even	use	that	cloth	to	clean	my	two	-	wheeler	.
then	i	 under 	 stood 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	 adapt 	 ing 	 	that	 un 	 hygien 	 ic 	 	method	to	manage	her	period	 day 	 s 	 	.
then	i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	,	why	are	you	[	using	]	that	 un 	 hygien 	 ic 	 	method	?
she	 re 	 plied 	 	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	know	about	[	 sanit 	 ary 	 	 pad 	 s 	 	]	,	but	 my 	 self 	 	and	my	 sister 	 s 	 	,	if	they	start	using	that	,	we	have	to	cut	our	family	milk	budget	.
then	i	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	.	what	is	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	using	a	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	and	a	milk	budget	?
and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 afford 	 ability 	 	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	impress	my	new	wife	by	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	her	a	 pack 	 et 	 	of	 sanit 	 ary 	 	 pad 	 s 	 	.
i	went	to	a	local	shop	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	buy	her	a	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	 pack 	 et 	 	.
that	fellow	 look 	 s 	 	left	and	right	,	and	 spread 	 s 	 	a	 news 	 paper 	 	,	 roll 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 news 	 paper 	 	,	 give 	 s 	 	it	to	me	like	a	 bann 	 ed 	 	item	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
i	do	n't	know	why	.	i	did	not	ask	for	a	condom	.
then	i	took	that	pad	.	i	want	to	see	that	.	what	is	 in 	 side 	 	it	?
the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	,	at	the	age	of	29	,	that	day	i	am	 touch 	 ing 	 	the	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	,	first	ever	.
i	must	know	:	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 guy 	 s 	 	here	have	 touch 	 ed 	 	a	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	?
they	are	not	going	to	touch	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	your	matter	.
then	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	white	 sub 	 stance 	 	,	made	of	cotton	--	oh	my	god	,	that	guy	is	just	using	a	 pen 	 ny 	 	value	of	raw	material	--	 in 	 side 	 	they	are	selling	for	 pound 	 s 	 	,	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
why	not	make	a	local	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	for	my	new	wife	?
that	's	how	all	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	but	after	making	a	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	,	where	can	i	check	it	?
it	's	not	like	i	can	just	check	it	in	the	lab	.
i	need	a	woman	volunteer	.	where	can	i	get	one	in	india	?
even	in	bangalore	you	wo	n't	get	[	one	]	,	in	india	.
so	 on 	 ly 	 	problem	:	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	victim	is	my	wife	.
then	i	made	a	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	and	 hand 	 ed 	 	it	to	shanti	--	my	wife	's	name	is	shanti	.
``	close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.	 what 	 ever 	 	i	give	,	it	will	be	not	a	diamond	 pend 	 ant 	 	not	a	diamond	ring	,	even	a	chocolate	,	i	will	give	you	a	surprise	with	a	lot	of	 tin 	 s 	 el 	 	paper	 roll 	 ed 	 	up	with	it	.
close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	it	 intima 	 te 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	 arrange 	 d 	 	marriage	,	not	a	love	marriage	.
so	one	day	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 open 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	not	going	to	support	 th 	 is 	 	research	.
then	other	 victim 	 s 	 	,	they	got	 in 	 to 	 	my	 sister 	 s 	 	.
but	even	 sister 	 s 	 	,	wives	,	they	're	not	ready	to	support	in	the	research	.
that	's	why	i	am	 al 	 ways 	 	jealous	with	the	 saint 	 s 	 	in	india	.
they	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	women	 volunteer 	 s 	 	around	them	.
why	i	am	not	 get 	 ting 	 	[	any	]	?
you	know	,	 with 	 out 	 	them	even	 call 	 ing 	 	,	they	'll	get	a	lot	of	women	 volunteer 	 s 	 	.
then	i	used	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	use	the	medical	college	 girl 	 s 	 	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 fused 	 	.	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	decide	,	use	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	 my 	 self 	 	.
now	i	am	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	title	like	the	first	man	to	set	foot	on	the	moon	.
armstrong	.	then	tenzing	[	and	]	hillary	,	in	everest	,	like	that	muruganantham	is	the	first	man	 wo 	 re 	 	a	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
i	 wo 	 re 	 	a	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	.	i	 fill 	 ed 	 	animal	blood	in	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	bottle	,	i	 ti 	 ed 	 	it	up	here	,	there	is	a	tube	going	 in 	 to 	 	my	 pan 	 ties 	 	,	while	i	'm	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	while	i	'm	 cycl 	 ing 	 	,	i	made	a	press	,	 dose 	 s 	 	of	blood	will	go	there	.
that	 make 	 s 	 	me	bow	down	to	any	woman	in	front	of	me	to	give	full	respect	.	that	five	 day 	 s 	 	i	'll	never	forget	--	the	 mess 	 y 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	the	 lous 	 y 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	that	 wet 	 ness 	 	.
my	god	,	it	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
but	here	the	problem	is	,	one	company	is	making	napkin	out	of	cotton	.	it	is	 work 	 ing 	 	well	.
but	i	am	 al 	 so 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	with	the	good	cotton	.	it	's	not	 work 	 ing 	 	.
that	 make 	 s 	 	me	to	want	to	 re 	 fuse 	 	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	research	and	research	and	research	.
you	need	first	 fund 	 s 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	financial	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	research	,	i	come	through	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	a	divorce	notice	from	my	wife	.
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	i	used	medical	college	 girl 	 s 	 	.
she	 suspect 	 s 	 	i	am	using	 a 	 s 	 	a	trump	card	to	run	 be 	 hind 	 	medical	college	 girl 	 s 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	came	to	know	it	is	a	special	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	derived	from	a	 pine 	 wood 	 	,	but	even	after	that	,	you	need	a	 multi 	 million 	 	-	dollar	plant	like	 th 	 is 	 	to	process	that	material	.	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	stop	-	up	.
then	i	 s 	 pend 	 	 an 	 other 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	to	create	my	own	machine	 tool 	 s 	 	,	a	simple	machine	tool	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	machine	,	any	 r 	 ural 	 	woman	can	 app 	 ly 	 	the	same	raw	 material 	 s 	 	that	they	are	 process 	 ing 	 	in	the	 multi 	 national 	 	plant	,	 any 	 one 	 	can	make	a	world	-	class	napkin	at	your	 din 	 ing 	 	hall	.
that	is	my	 invent 	 ion 	 	.
so	after	that	,	what	i	did	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	if	 any 	 one 	 	got	a	patent	or	an	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	you	want	to	make	,	convert	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	never	did	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	 drop 	 ped 	 	it	just	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	 any 	 one 	 	 run 	 s 	 	after	money	,	 the 	 ir 	 	life	will	not	[	have	]	any	 beaut 	 y 	 	.	it	is	 bore 	 dom 	 	.
a	lot	of	people	making	a	lot	of	money	,	billion	,	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ating 	 	.
why	are	they	coming	for	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	for	 philanthro 	 py 	 	?
why	the	need	for	 accumul 	 ating 	 	money	,	then	 do 	 ing 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	?
what	if	one	 decide 	 d 	 	to	start	 philanthro 	 py 	 	from	the	day	one	?
that	's	why	i	am	giving	 th 	 is 	 	machine	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	india	,	for	 r 	 ural 	 	women	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	india	,	[	you	'll	be	]	 surprise 	 d 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	two	percent	of	women	are	using	 sanit 	 ary 	 	 pad 	 s 	 	.	the	rest	,	they	're	using	a	rag	cloth	,	a	leaf	,	husk	,	[	saw	]	dust	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	 sanit 	 ary 	 	 pad 	 s 	 	.
it	is	the	same	in	the	21st	century	.	that	's	why	i	am	going	to	decide	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	machine	 on 	 ly 	 	for	poor	women	 a 	 cross 	 	india	.
so	far	,	630	 install 	 ations 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	23	 state 	 s 	 	in	six	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
now	i	'm	on	my	 seven 	 th 	 	year	 sustain 	 ing 	 	against	 multi 	 national 	 	,	 trans 	 national 	 	 giant 	 s 	 	--	 make 	 s 	 	all	mba	 student 	 s 	 	a	question	mark	.
a	school	 drop 	 out 	 	from	coimbatore	,	how	he	is	able	to	 sustain 	 ing 	 	?
that	 make 	 s 	 	me	a	 visit 	 ing 	 	professor	and	guest	 lectur 	 er 	 	in	all	iims	.

arunachalam	muruganantham	:	the	thing	i	saw	in	my	wife	's	hand	,	``	why	are	you	using	that	nasty	cloth	?	``
she	 re 	 plied 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	``	i	know	about	 napkin 	 s 	 	,	but	if	i	start	using	 napkin 	 s 	 	,	then	we	have	to	cut	our	family	milk	budget	.	``
why	not	make	 my 	 self 	 	a	low	-	cost	napkin	?
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	'm	going	to	sell	 th 	 is 	 	new	machine	 on 	 ly 	 	for	women	self	help	 group 	 s 	 	.
that	is	my	idea	.
am	:	and	 previous 	 ly 	 	,	you	need	a	 multi 	 million 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	for	machine	and	all	.	now	,	any	 r 	 ural 	 	woman	can	.
they	are	 perform 	 ing 	 	 pu 	 ja 	 	.
:	you	just	think	,	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	 giant 	 s 	 	,	even	from	harvard	,	oxford	,	is	difficult	.
i	make	a	 r 	 ural 	 	woman	to	compete	with	 multi 	 national 	 s 	 	.

in	 th 	 is 	 	way	i	'm	going	to	provide	not	less	than	a	million	 r 	 ural 	 	 employ 	 ment 	 	that	i	'm	going	to	create	.
that	's	why	i	'm	not	running	after	 th 	 is 	 	 blood 	 y 	 	money	.
i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	serious	.
if	you	chase	a	girl	,	the	girl	wo	n't	like	you	.

that	's	all	.	a	school	 drop 	 out 	 	saw	your	problem	in	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	of	not	using	 sanit 	 ary 	 	pad	.
i	am	 be 	 coming 	 	a	solution	 provide 	 r 	 	.	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	.
