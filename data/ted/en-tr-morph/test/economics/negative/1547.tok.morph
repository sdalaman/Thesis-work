i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	i	'm	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 speaker 	 s 	 	you	hope	you	're	not	going	to	meet	at	ted	.
first	,	i	do	n't	have	a	mobile	,	so	i	'm	on	the	safe	side	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	a	 politic 	 al 	 	 theor 	 ist 	 	who	's	going	to	talk	about	the	crisis	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	you	can	think	about	.
and	plus	,	i	'm	not	going	to	give	you	any	 answer 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	much	more	 try 	 ing 	 	to	add	to	some	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	want	to	question	is	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	hope	these	 day 	 s 	 	that	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	and	 open 	 ness 	 	can	 re 	 store 	 	the	trust	in	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	.
there	is	one	more	reason	for	you	to	be	suspicious	about	me	.
you	people	,	the	church	of	ted	,	are	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	community	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	you	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	but	not	in	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	told	,	i	'm	bulgarian	.
and	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	 survey 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 mark 	 ed 	 	the	most	 pessim 	 istic 	 	people	in	the	world	.
the	economist	magazine	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	wrote	an	article	 cover 	 ing 	 	one	of	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	on	happiness	,	and	the	title	was	``	the	happy	,	the	 un 	 happy 	 	and	the	bulgarians	.	``
so	now	when	you	know	what	to	expect	,	let	's	give	you	the	story	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 rain 	 y 	 	election	day	in	a	small	country	--	that	can	be	my	country	,	but	could	be	 al 	 so 	 	your	country	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	rain	 un 	 til 	 	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	afternoon	,	 no 	 body 	 	went	to	the	 poll 	 ing 	 	 station 	 s 	 	.
but	then	the	rain	 stop 	 ped 	 	,	people	went	to	vote	.
and	when	the	 vote 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 count 	 ed 	 	,	three	-	fourths	of	the	people	have	 vot 	 ed 	 	with	a	blank	 ball 	 ot 	 	.
the	government	and	the	 op 	 position 	 	,	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	what	to	do	about	the	 protest 	 s 	 	.
you	know	who	to	arrest	,	who	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	with	.
but	what	to	do	about	people	who	are	 vot 	 ing 	 	with	a	blank	 ball 	 ot 	 	?
so	the	government	 decide 	 d 	 	to	have	the	 election 	 s 	 	once	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	time	even	a	 great 	 er 	 	number	,	83	percent	of	the	people	,	 vot 	 ed 	 	with	blank	 ball 	 ot 	 s 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	they	went	to	the	 ball 	 ot 	 	boxes	to	tell	that	they	have	 no 	 body 	 	to	vote	for	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 open 	 ing 	 	of	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	novel	by	jose	saramago	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 see 	 ing 	 	.	``
but	in	my	view	it	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 capture 	 s 	 	part	of	the	problem	that	we	have	with	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	europe	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
on	one	level	 no 	 body 	 	's	 question 	 ing 	 	that	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	the	best	form	of	government	.
 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	game	in	town	.
the	problem	is	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	start	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	is	not	a	game	worth	 play 	 ing 	 	.
for	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	 politic 	 al 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 observ 	 ed 	 	that	there	is	a	constant	decline	in	 elect 	 or 	 al 	 	 turn 	 out 	 	,	and	the	people	who	are	 l 	 east 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	vote	are	the	people	whom	you	expect	are	going	to	gain	most	out	of	 vot 	 ing 	 	.
i	mean	the	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	,	the	under	-	 privilege 	 d 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	major	issue	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	now	with	the	economic	crisis	,	you	can	see	that	the	trust	in	 politic 	 s 	 	,	that	the	trust	in	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	,	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	 lat 	 est 	 	survey	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	the	european	commission	,	89	percent	of	the	 citizen 	 s 	 	of	europe	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	is	a	growing	gap	between	the	opinion	of	the	policy	-	makers	and	the	opinion	of	the	public	.
 on 	 ly 	 	18	percent	of	italians	and	15	percent	of	greeks	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	vote	 matter 	 s 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	people	start	to	understand	that	they	can	change	 government 	 s 	 	,	but	they	can	not	change	 poli 	 cies 	 	.
and	the	question	which	i	want	to	ask	is	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	:	how	did	it	happen	that	we	are	living	in	 socie 	 ties 	 	which	are	much	 free 	 r 	 	than	ever	before	--	we	have	more	 right 	 s 	 	,	we	can	travel	 eas 	 ier 	 	,	we	have	access	to	more	information	--	at	the	same	time	that	trust	in	our	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	?
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	i	want	to	ask	:	what	went	right	and	what	went	wrong	in	these	50	 year 	 s 	 	when	we	talk	about	 demo 	 cracy 	 	?
and	i	'll	start	with	what	went	right	.
and	the	first	thing	that	went	right	was	,	of	course	,	these	five	 revolution 	 s 	 	which	,	in	my	view	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	we	're	living	and	 deepen 	 ed 	 	our	 democrat 	 ic 	 	experience	.
and	the	first	was	the	cultural	and	social	revolution	of	1968	and	1970s	,	which	put	the	individual	at	the	center	of	 politic 	 s 	 	.
it	was	the	human	 right 	 s 	 	moment	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	major	 out 	 break 	 	,	a	culture	of	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	,	a	culture	of	 bas 	 ically 	 	non	-	conformism	,	which	was	not	known	before	.
so	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	even	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	children	of	'68	--	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	that	most	of	us	had	 be 	 en 	 	even	not	born	then	.
but	after	that	you	have	the	market	revolution	of	the	1980s	.
and	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	on	the	left	try	to	hate	it	,	the	truth	is	that	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	market	revolution	that	 s 	 ent 	 	the	 mess 	 age 	 	:	``	the	government	 do 	 es 	 	not	know	better	.	``
and	you	have	more	choice	-	driven	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
and	of	course	,	you	have	1989	--	the	end	of	 commun 	 ism 	 	,	the	end	of	the	cold	war	.
and	it	was	the	birth	of	the	global	world	.
and	you	have	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	audience	to	which	i	'm	going	to	preach	to	what	 ex 	 tent 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	people	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	we	are	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	we	are	 view 	 ing 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	idea	of	 politic 	 al 	 	community	 total 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	name	one	more	revolution	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	revolution	in	brain	 science 	 s 	 	,	which	 total 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	we	understand	how	people	are	making	 decision 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	went	right	.
but	if	we	're	going	to	see	what	went	wrong	,	we	're	going	to	end	up	with	the	same	five	 revolution 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	first	you	have	the	1960s	and	1970s	,	cultural	and	social	revolution	,	which	in	a	certain	way	 destroy 	 ed 	 	the	idea	of	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	purpose	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	idea	,	all	these	 collect 	 ive 	 	 no 	 un 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	taught	about	--	nation	,	class	,	family	.
we	start	to	like	 div 	 orc 	 ing 	 	,	if	we	're	married	at	all	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	under	attack	.
and	it	is	so	difficult	to	engage	people	in	 politic 	 s 	 	when	they	 believ 	 e 	 	that	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	is	where	they	 personal 	 ly 	 	stand	.
and	you	have	the	market	revolution	of	the	1980s	and	the	huge	 in 	 crease 	 	of	 ine 	 quality 	 	in	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
remember	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	1970s	,	the	spread	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	the	decline	of	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
the	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	,	the	more	equal	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	.
now	we	have	the	reverse	 tend 	 ency 	 	.
the	spread	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	now	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
and	i	find	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 disturb 	 ing 	 	when	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	what	's	going	on	right	and	wrong	with	 demo 	 cracy 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	go	to	1989	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	you	do	n't	expect	that	 any 	 body 	 	's	going	to	 critic 	 ize 	 	--	but	 man 	 y 	 	are	going	to	tell	you	,	``	listen	,	it	was	the	end	of	the	cold	war	that	 to 	 re 	 	the	social	contract	between	the	 elite 	 s 	 	and	the	people	in	western	europe	.	``
when	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	was	still	there	,	the	rich	and	the	 power 	 ful 	 	,	they	 need 	 ed 	 	the	people	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 fear 	 ed 	 	them	.
now	the	 elite 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 liberate 	 d 	 	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	mobile	.	you	can	not	tax	them	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	they	do	n't	fear	the	people	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	it	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	which	the	 elite 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	got	out	of	the	control	of	the	 vot 	 ers 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	by	accident	that	the	 vot 	 ers 	 	are	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	vote	 any 	 more 	 	.
and	when	we	talk	about	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	true	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	all	of	us	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 create 	 d 	 	these	echo	 chamber 	 s 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 ghetto 	 s 	 	in	which	for	all	your	life	you	can	stay	with	the	 politic 	 al 	 	community	you	belong	to	.
and	it	's	 be 	 coming 	 	more	and	more	difficult	to	understand	the	people	who	are	not	like	you	.
i	know	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	have	 be 	 en 	 	 splendid 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	about	the	digital	world	and	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	for	 co 	 operation 	 	,	but	[	have	you	]	 s 	 een 	 	what	the	digital	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	american	 politic 	 s 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 part 	 ly 	 	a	result	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	revolution	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	other	side	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	like	.
and	when	you	go	to	the	brain	 science 	 s 	 	,	what	 politic 	 al 	 	 consult 	 ants 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	the	brain	 scientist 	 s 	 	is	do	n't	talk	to	me	about	 idea 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,	do	n't	talk	to	me	about	policy	 program 	 s 	 	.
what	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	the	 emotion 	 s 	 	of	the	people	.
and	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	that	,	even	if	you	see	when	we	talk	about	 revolution 	 s 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	these	 revolution 	 s 	 	are	not	named	 any 	 more 	 	around	 ideo 	 logies 	 	or	 idea 	 s 	 	.
before	,	 revolution 	 s 	 	used	to	have	 ideo 	 logical 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
they	could	be	 commun 	 ist 	 	,	they	could	be	liberal	,	they	could	be	 fasci 	 st 	 	or	islamic	.
now	the	 revolution 	 s 	 	are	 call 	 ed 	 	under	the	medium	which	is	most	used	.
you	have	facebook	 revolution 	 s 	 	,	twitter	 revolution 	 s 	 	.
the	content	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 any 	 more 	 	,	the	problem	is	the	media	.
i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	my	major	 point 	 s 	 	is	what	went	right	is	 al 	 so 	 	what	went	wrong	.
and	when	we	're	now	 try 	 ing 	 	to	see	how	we	can	change	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	when	 bas 	 ically 	 	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	see	what	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	about	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	we	should	keep	 th 	 is 	 	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	in	mind	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	love	most	are	going	to	be	 al 	 so 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	hurt	us	most	.
these	 day 	 s 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	push	for	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	a	combination	between	active	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	much	more	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	-	friendly	 legisl 	 ation 	 	can	 re 	 store 	 	trust	in	 politic 	 s 	 	.
you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	when	you	have	these	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	people	who	are	ready	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	can	make	it	much	more	difficult	for	the	 government 	 s 	 	to	lie	,	it	's	going	to	be	more	difficult	for	them	to	steal	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	even	going	to	be	more	difficult	for	them	to	kill	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	true	.
but	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	should	be	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	that	now	when	we	put	the	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	at	the	center	of	 politic 	 s 	 	where	the	 mess 	 age 	 	is	that	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	is	stupid	.
 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	is	not	about	 re 	 storing 	 	trust	in	 institution 	 s 	 	.
 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	is	 politic 	 s 	 	'	management	of	 mis 	 trust 	 	.
we	are	 assum 	 ing 	 	that	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	are	going	to	be	based	on	 mis 	 trust 	 	.
and	by	the	way	,	 mis 	 trust 	 	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	you	have	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	 bas 	 ically 	 	you	have	all	 th 	 is 	 	creative	 mis 	 trust 	 	between	the	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	whom	they	represent	.
but	when	 politic 	 s 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	management	of	 mis 	 trust 	 	,	then	--	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	glad	that	``	1984	``	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	--	now	we	're	going	to	have	``	1984	``	in	reverse	.
it	's	not	going	to	be	the	big	brother	 watch 	 ing 	 	you	,	it	's	going	to	be	we	 be 	 ing 	 	the	big	brother	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	 politic 	 al 	 	class	.
but	is	 th 	 is 	 	the	idea	of	a	free	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	can	you	imagine	that	 de 	 cent 	 	,	civic	,	 talent 	 ed 	 	people	are	going	to	run	for	 off 	 ice 	 	if	they	 re 	 ally 	 	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 politic 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	about	 man 	 aging 	 	 mis 	 trust 	 	?
are	you	not	 af 	 raid 	 	with	all	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	are	going	to	track	down	any	 state 	 ment 	 	the	 politic 	 ians 	 	are	going	to	make	on	certain	 issue 	 s 	 	,	are	you	not	 af 	 raid 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	signal	to	 politic 	 ians 	 	to	repeat	 the 	 ir 	 	 position 	 s 	 	,	even	the	 ver 	 y 	 	wrong	 position 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 consist 	 ency 	 	is	going	to	be	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	common	sense	?
and	the	americans	who	are	in	the	room	,	are	you	not	 af 	 raid 	 	that	your	 pre 	 sidents 	 	are	going	to	govern	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	what	they	 s 	 aid 	 	in	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 election 	 s 	 	?
i	find	 th 	 is 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	about	people	changing	 the 	 ir 	 	 view 	 s 	 	based	on	rational	 argument 	 s 	 	and	 discuss 	 ions 	 	.
and	we	can	lose	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	 ver 	 y 	 	noble	idea	to	keep	people	 account 	 able 	 	for	 show 	 ing 	 	the	people	that	we	're	not	going	to	 toler 	 ate 	 	 politic 	 ians 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ism 	 	in	 politic 	 s 	 	.
so	for	me	 th 	 is 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	when	we	're	 discuss 	 ing 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	sense	to	look	 al 	 so 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	a	story	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	do	n't	forget	,	any	 unveil 	 ing 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 veil 	 ing 	 	.
[	 regard 	 less 	 	of	]	how	 trans 	 parent 	 	our	 government 	 s 	 	want	to	be	,	they	're	going	to	be	 select 	 ively 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	.
in	a	small	country	that	could	be	my	country	,	but	could	be	 al 	 so 	 	your	country	,	they	took	a	decision	--	it	is	a	real	case	story	--	that	all	of	the	 government 	 al 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	,	 discuss 	 ions 	 	of	the	council	of	 mini 	 sters 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	 publish 	 ed 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	after	the	council	 discuss 	 ions 	 	took	place	.
and	the	public	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	all	for	it	.
so	i	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	talk	to	the	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	why	he	made	 th 	 is 	 	decision	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	listen	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	best	way	to	keep	the	 mouth 	 s 	 	of	my	 mini 	 sters 	 	closed	.
