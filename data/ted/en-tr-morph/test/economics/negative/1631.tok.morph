i	'm	 usual 	 ly 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	polar	 explore 	 r 	 	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	that	's	the	most	 progress 	 ive 	 	or	21st	-	century	of	job	 title 	 s 	 	,	but	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	more	than	two	percent	now	of	my	entire	life	living	in	a	tent	 in 	 side 	 	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	circle	,	so	i	get	out	of	the	house	a	fair	bit	.
and	in	my	nature	,	i	guess	,	i	am	a	 do 	 er 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	more	than	i	am	a	 spect 	 ator 	 	or	a	 contempl 	 ator 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	that	 d 	 ich 	 otomy 	 	,	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	between	 idea 	 s 	 	and	action	that	i	'm	going	to	try	and	explore	 brief 	 ly 	 	.
the	 pi 	 th 	 iest 	 	answer	to	the	question	``	why	?	``
that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 dog 	 ging 	 	me	for	the	last	12	 year 	 s 	 	was	 credit 	 ed 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	chap	,	the	rakish	-	looking	 gentle 	 man 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	at	the	back	,	second	from	the	left	,	george	lee	mallory	.	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	know	his	name	.
in	1924	he	was	last	 s 	 een 	 	 disappear 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	near	the	 summ 	 it 	 	of	mt	.	everest	.
he	may	or	may	not	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	first	person	to	climb	everest	,	more	than	30	 year 	 s 	 	before	edmund	hillary	.
no	one	 know 	 s 	 	if	he	got	to	the	top	.	it	's	still	a	 myster 	 y 	 	.
but	he	was	 credit 	 ed 	 	with	 co 	 in 	 ing 	 	the	phrase	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	there	.	``
now	i	'm	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	he	did	say	that	.
there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	little	evidence	to	suggest	it	,	but	what	he	did	say	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	far	 nic 	 er 	 	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	've	 print 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	'm	going	to	read	it	out	.
``	the	first	question	which	you	will	ask	and	which	i	must	try	to	answer	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	what	is	the	use	of	 climb 	 ing 	 	mt	.	everest	?
and	my	answer	must	at	once	be	,	it	is	no	use	.
there	is	not	the	 s 	 light 	 est 	 	prospect	of	any	gain	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
oh	,	we	may	learn	a	little	about	the	behavior	of	the	human	body	at	high	 altitude 	 s 	 	,	and	possibly	medical	men	may	turn	our	 observ 	 ation 	 	to	some	account	for	the	 purpose 	 s 	 	of	 av 	 iation 	 	,	but	 other 	 wise 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	will	come	of	it	.
we	 s 	 hall 	 	not	 br 	 ing 	 	back	a	single	bit	of	gold	or	silver	,	and	not	a	gem	,	nor	any	coal	or	iron	.
we	 s 	 hall 	 	not	find	a	single	foot	of	earth	that	can	be	 plant 	 ed 	 	with	 crop 	 s 	 	to	raise	food	.	so	it	is	no	use	.
if	you	can	not	understand	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	in	man	which	 respond 	 s 	 	to	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	mountain	and	 go 	 es 	 	out	to	meet	it	,	that	the	struggle	is	the	struggle	of	life	 it 	 self 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	and	 fore 	 ver 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	,	then	you	wo	n't	see	why	we	go	.
what	we	get	from	 th 	 is 	 	adventure	is	just	 she 	 er 	 	joy	,	and	joy	,	after	all	,	is	the	end	of	life	.
we	do	n't	live	to	eat	and	make	money	.
we	eat	and	make	money	to	be	able	to	enjoy	life	.
that	is	what	life	 mean 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	what	life	is	for	.	``
mallory	's	argument	that	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	house	,	 embark 	 ing 	 	on	these	grand	 adventure 	 s 	 	is	 joy 	 ful 	 	and	 f 	 un 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 t 	 ally 	 	that	 neat 	 ly 	 	with	my	own	experience	.
the	 fur 	 th 	 est 	 	i	've	ever	got	away	from	my	front	door	was	in	the	spring	of	2004	.	i	still	do	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	came	over	me	,	but	my	plan	was	to	make	a	 s 	 olo 	 	and	 un 	 support 	 ed 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	ocean	.
i	 plan 	 ned 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	to	walk	from	the	north	coast	of	russia	to	the	north	pole	,	and	then	to	carry	on	to	the	north	coast	of	canada	.
no	one	had	ever	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	was	26	at	the	time	.
a	lot	of	 expert 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	it	was	 im 	 possible 	 	,	and	my	mum	 certain 	 ly 	 	was	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	keen	on	the	idea	.
the	journey	from	a	small	weather	station	on	the	north	coast	of	siberia	up	to	my	final	 start 	 ing 	 	point	,	the	edge	of	the	pack	ice	,	the	coast	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	ocean	,	took	about	five	 hour 	 s 	 	,	and	if	 any 	 one 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	 fear 	 less 	 	felix	baumgartner	going	up	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	coming	down	,	you	'll	appreciate	the	sense	of	 apprehens 	 ion 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 at 	 	in	a	helicopter	 thunder 	 ing 	 	north	,	and	the	sense	,	i	think	if	 any 	 thing 	 	,	of	 imp 	 end 	 ing 	 	doom	.
i	 s 	 at 	 	there	 wonder 	 ing 	 	what	on	earth	i	had	gotten	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	.
there	was	a	bit	of	 f 	 un 	 	,	a	bit	of	joy	.
i	was	26.	i	remember	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	looking	down	at	my	 s 	 ledge 	 	.	i	had	my	 ski 	 s 	 	ready	to	go	,	i	had	a	satellite	phone	,	a	pump	-	action	 shot 	 gun 	 	in	case	i	was	 attack 	 ed 	 	by	a	polar	bear	.
i	remember	looking	out	of	the	window	and	 see 	 ing 	 	the	second	helicopter	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	both	 thunder 	 ing 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	siberian	dawn	,	and	part	of	me	felt	a	bit	like	a	cross	between	jason	bourne	and	wilfred	thesiger	.	part	of	me	felt	 quit 	 e 	 	proud	of	 my 	 self 	 	,	but	 most 	 ly 	 	i	was	just	 utter 	 ly 	 	 terr 	 ified 	 	.
and	that	journey	 last 	 ed 	 	10	 week 	 s 	 	,	72	 day 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	see	 any 	 one 	 	else	.	we	took	 th 	 is 	 	photo	next	to	the	helicopter	.
beyond	that	,	i	did	n't	see	 any 	 one 	 	for	10	 week 	 s 	 	.
the	north	pole	is	 s 	 lap 	 	bang	in	the	middle	of	the	sea	,	so	i	'm	 travel 	 ing 	 	over	the	 froze 	 n 	 	surface	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	ocean	.
nasa	 de 	 scribed 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	that	year	 a 	 s 	 	the	worst	since	 record 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	.
i	was	 drag 	 ging 	 	180	 kilo 	 s 	 	of	food	and	fuel	and	 suppli 	 es 	 	,	about	400	 pound 	 s 	 	.	the	average	temperature	for	the	10	 week 	 s 	 	was	minus	35.	minus	50	was	the	 cold 	 est 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	there	was	n't	an	awful	lot	of	joy	or	 f 	 un 	 	to	be	had	.
one	of	the	 magic 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	journey	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	is	that	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 walk 	 ing 	 	over	the	sea	,	over	 th 	 is 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	,	 drift 	 ing 	 	,	shifting	crust	of	ice	that	's	 float 	 ing 	 	on	top	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	ocean	is	it	's	an	environment	that	's	in	a	constant	state	of	flux	.
the	ice	is	 al 	 ways 	 	moving	,	 break 	 ing 	 	up	,	 drift 	 ing 	 	around	,	 re 	 freezing 	 	,	so	the	 scene 	 ry 	 	that	i	saw	for	 near 	 ly 	 	3	 month 	 s 	 	was	 un 	 ique 	 	to	me	.	no	one	else	will	ever	,	could	ever	,	possibly	see	the	 view 	 s 	 	,	the	 vista 	 s 	 	,	that	i	saw	for	10	 week 	 s 	 	.
and	that	,	i	guess	,	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 fin 	 est 	 	argument	for	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	house	.
i	can	try	to	tell	you	what	it	was	like	,	but	you	'll	never	know	what	it	was	like	,	and	the	more	i	try	to	explain	that	i	felt	 lone 	 ly 	 	,	i	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	in	5.4	million	square	-	 mile 	 s 	 	,	it	was	cold	,	 near 	 ly 	 	minus	75	with	 wind 	 chill 	 	on	a	bad	day	,	the	more	 word 	 s 	 	fall	short	,	and	i	'm	 un 	 able 	 	to	do	it	justice	.
and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	that	the	 do 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	to	try	to	experience	,	to	engage	,	to	endeavor	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	to	watch	and	to	wonder	,	that	's	where	the	real	meat	of	life	is	to	be	found	,	the	juice	that	we	can	suck	out	of	our	 hour 	 s 	 	and	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	i	would	add	a	 caution 	 ary 	 	note	here	,	 how 	 ever 	 	.
in	my	experience	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 addict 	 ive 	 	about	tasting	life	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	edge	of	what	's	 human 	 ly 	 	possible	.
now	i	do	n't	just	mean	in	the	field	of	 d 	 aft 	 	 ma 	 cho 	 	edwardian	style	derring	-	do	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	 field 	 s 	 	of	 pan 	 cre 	 atic 	 	cancer	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 addict 	 ive 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	in	my	case	,	i	think	polar	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	are	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	that	far	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	crack	habit	.
i	ca	n't	explain	 quit 	 e 	 	how	good	it	is	 un 	 til 	 	you	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	burn	up	all	the	money	i	can	get	my	 hand 	 s 	 	on	,	to	ruin	every	relationship	i	've	ever	had	,	so	be	 care 	 ful 	 	what	you	wish	for	.
mallory	 post 	 ulated 	 	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	in	man	that	 respond 	 s 	 	to	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	the	mountain	,	and	i	wonder	if	that	's	the	case	 whet 	 her 	 	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	in	the	endeavor	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	the	big	,	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	 chunk 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	face	 human 	 ity 	 	that	call	out	to	us	,	and	in	my	experience	that	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	case	.
there	is	one	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	out	to	me	for	most	of	my	adult	life	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	know	the	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photo	of	 cap 	 tain 	 	scott	and	his	team	.
scott	set	out	just	over	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	to	try	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	first	person	to	reach	the	south	pole	.
no	one	 k 	 new 	 	what	was	there	.	it	was	 utter 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ma 	 pped 	 	at	the	time	.	we	 k 	 new 	 	more	about	the	surface	of	the	moon	than	we	did	about	the	heart	of	antarctica	.
scott	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	know	,	was	 beat 	 en 	 	to	it	by	roald	amundsen	and	his	norwegian	team	,	who	used	 dog 	 s 	 	and	 dog 	 s 	 led 	 s 	 	.	scott	's	team	 we 	 re 	 	on	foot	,	all	five	of	them	 wear 	 ing 	 	 harness 	 es 	 	and	 drag 	 ging 	 	around	 s 	 ledge 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	the	pole	to	find	the	norwegian	flag	 al 	 ready 	 	there	,	i	'd	imagine	 pre 	 tty 	 	bitter	and	 de 	 moralize 	 d 	 	.
all	five	of	them	 turn 	 ed 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	back	to	the	coast	and	all	five	 di 	 ed 	 	on	that	return	journey	.
there	is	a	sort	of	 mis 	 conception 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	that	it	's	all	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	 field 	 s 	 	of	exploration	and	adventure	.
when	i	talk	about	antarctica	,	people	often	say	,	``	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	,	you	know	,	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	that	blue	peter	 present 	 er 	 	just	 d 	 one 	 	it	on	a	bike	?	``
or	,	``	that	's	nice	.	you	know	,	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	's	going	on	a	 cruis 	 e 	 	to	antarctica	next	year	.	you	know	.
is	there	a	chance	you	'll	see	her	there	?	``
but	scott	's	journey	 remain 	 s 	 	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 walk 	 ed 	 	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	coast	of	antarctica	to	the	south	pole	and	back	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	is	,	 argu 	 ably 	 	,	the	most	 au 	 d 	 acious 	 	endeavor	of	that	edwardian	 gold 	 en 	 	age	of	exploration	,	and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	me	high	time	,	 give 	 n 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	we	have	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	in	the	century	since	from	 s 	 curv 	 y 	 	to	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	,	that	it	was	high	time	 some 	 one 	 	had	a	go	at	 finish 	 ing 	 	the	job	.
so	that	's	 precise 	 ly 	 	what	i	'm	setting	out	to	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	next	year	,	in	october	,	i	'm	 lead 	 ing 	 	a	team	of	three	.
it	will	take	us	about	four	 month 	 s 	 	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	return	journey	.
that	's	the	scale	.	the	red	line	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 half 	 way 	 	to	the	pole	.
we	have	to	turn	around	and	come	back	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	'm	well	aware	of	the	 iron 	 y 	 	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	that	we	will	be	 b 	 logging 	 	and	 tweet 	 ing 	 	.	you	'll	be	able	to	live	 vi 	 car 	 iously 	 	and	 virtual 	 ly 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	journey	in	a	way	that	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	before	.
and	it	'll	 al 	 so 	 	be	a	four	-	month	chance	for	me	to	 final 	 ly 	 	come	up	with	a	 pit 	 hy 	 	answer	to	the	question	,	``	why	?	``
