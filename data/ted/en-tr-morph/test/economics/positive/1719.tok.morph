that	's	how	we	 travel 	 ed 	 	in	the	year	1900	.
that	's	an	open	 bug 	 gy 	 	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 heat 	 ing 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	.
that	horse	is	 pull 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 long 	 	at	one	percent	of	the	speed	of	sound	,	and	the	 rut 	 ted 	 	dirt	road	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 qu 	 agmire 	 	of	mud	 any 	 time 	 	it	 rain 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	boeing	707	.
 on 	 ly 	 	60	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	 travel 	 s 	 	at	80	percent	of	the	speed	of	sound	,	and	we	do	n't	travel	any	 fast 	 er 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	commercial	 super 	 sonic 	 	air	travel	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	bust	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	and	 ponder 	 ing 	 	,	could	it	be	that	the	best	 year 	 s 	 	of	american	economic	growth	are	 be 	 hind 	 	us	?
and	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	the	 suggest 	 ion 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	economic	growth	is	 al 	 most 	 	over	.
some	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	controversial	.
there	are	four	 head 	 wind 	 s 	 	that	are	just	hitting	the	american	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	the	face	.
they	're	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	,	education	,	debt	and	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
they	're	 power 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	cut	growth	in	half	.
so	we	need	a	lot	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	to	 off 	 set 	 	 th 	 is 	 	decline	.
and	here	's	my	theme	:	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 head 	 wind 	 s 	 	,	if	 innov 	 ation 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	last	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	growth	is	cut	in	half	.
if	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	less	 power 	 ful 	 	,	 invent 	 s 	 	less	great	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	then	growth	is	going	to	be	even	lower	than	half	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
now	here	's	eight	centuries	of	economic	growth	.
the	 vert 	 ical 	 	axis	is	just	percent	per	year	of	growth	,	zero	percent	a	year	,	one	percent	a	year	,	two	percent	a	year	.
the	white	line	is	for	the	u.k.	,	and	then	the	u.s	.
 take 	 s 	 	over	 a 	 s 	 	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	nation	in	the	year	1900	,	when	the	line	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	to	red	.
you	'll	notice	that	,	for	the	first	four	centuries	,	there	's	 hard 	 ly 	 	any	growth	at	all	,	just	0.2	percent	.
then	growth	 get 	 s 	 	better	and	better	.
it	 max 	 es 	 	out	in	the	1930s	,	'40s	and	'50s	,	and	then	it	 start 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	,	and	here	's	a	 caution 	 ary 	 	note	.
that	last	 down 	 ward 	 	 not 	 ch 	 	in	the	red	line	is	not	actual	data	.
that	is	a	 fore 	 cast 	 	that	i	made	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	growth	would	 s 	 low 	 	down	to	1.3	percent	.
but	you	know	what	the	actual	 fact 	 s 	 	are	?
you	know	what	the	growth	in	per	-	person	income	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	the	last	six	 year 	 s 	 	?
negative	.
 th 	 is 	 	led	to	a	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	.
what	if	i	try	to	fit	a	 curv 	 ed 	 	line	to	 th 	 is 	 	 historic 	 al 	 	record	?
i	can	make	the	 curv 	 ed 	 	line	end	 any 	 where 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	,	but	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	would	end	it	at	0.2	,	just	like	the	u.k.	growth	for	the	first	four	centuries	.
now	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	we	've	 achiev 	 ed 	 	is	that	we	've	grown	at	2.0	percent	per	year	over	the	whole	period	,	1891	to	2007	,	and	remember	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	little	bit	negative	since	2007	.
but	if	growth	 s 	 low 	 s 	 	down	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 doub 	 ling 	 	our	standard	of	living	every	generation	,	americans	in	the	future	ca	n't	expect	to	be	twice	 a 	 s 	 	well	off	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	or	even	a	quarter	[	more	well	off	than	]	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
now	we	're	going	to	change	and	look	at	the	level	of	per	capita	income	.
the	 vert 	 ical 	 	axis	now	is	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	 price 	 s 	 	.
you	'll	notice	that	in	1891	,	over	on	the	left	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	about	5,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	're	at	about	44,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	total	 out 	 put 	 	per	member	of	the	population	.
now	what	if	we	could	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	historic	two	-	percent	growth	for	the	next	70	 year 	 s 	 	?
well	,	it	's	a	matter	of	arithmetic	.
two	-	percent	growth	 quadruple 	 s 	 	your	standard	of	living	in	70	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	'd	go	from	44,000	to	180,000	.
well	,	we	're	not	going	to	do	that	,	and	the	reason	is	the	 head 	 wind 	 s 	 	.
the	first	 head 	 wind 	 	is	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	truism	that	your	standard	of	living	 rise 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	 product 	 ivity 	 	,	 rise 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	 out 	 put 	 	per	hour	,	if	 hour 	 s 	 	per	person	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	.
and	we	got	that	gift	back	in	the	'70s	and	'80s	when	women	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	labor	force	.
but	now	it	's	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	.
now	 hour 	 s 	 	per	person	are	 shrink 	 ing 	 	,	and	second	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	dropping	out	of	the	labor	force	of	prime	age	adult	 male 	 s 	 	who	are	in	the	bottom	half	of	the	 education 	 al 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
the	next	 head 	 wind 	 	is	education	.
we	've	got	 problem 	 s 	 	all	over	our	 education 	 al 	 	system	in	college	,	we	've	got	cost	 infla 	 tion 	 	in	 high 	 er 	 	education	that	 dwarf 	 s 	 	cost	 infla 	 tion 	 	in	medical	care	.
we	have	in	 high 	 er 	 	education	a	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	student	debt	,	and	our	college	 comple 	 tion 	 	rate	is	15	 point 	 s 	 	,	15	 percent 	 age 	 	 point 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	canada	.
we	have	a	lot	of	debt	.
our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	grew	from	2000	to	2007	on	the	back	of	 consumer 	 s 	 	 massive 	 ly 	 	 over 	 borrow 	 ing 	 	.
 consumer 	 s 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	off	that	debt	is	one	of	the	main	 reason 	 s 	 	why	our	economic	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	is	so	 s 	 lugg 	 ish 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	of	course	 know 	 s 	 	that	the	federal	government	debt	is	growing	 a 	 s 	 	a	share	of	gdp	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rapid	rate	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	's	going	to	stop	is	some	combination	of	 fast 	 er 	 	growth	in	 tax 	 es 	 	or	 s 	 lower 	 	growth	in	 entitlement 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	transfer	 payment 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 get 	 s 	 	us	down	from	the	1.5	,	where	we	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	for	education	,	down	to	1.3	.
and	then	we	have	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
over	the	15	 year 	 s 	 	before	the	financial	crisis	,	the	growth	rate	of	the	bottom	99	percent	of	the	income	 distribut 	 ion 	 	was	half	a	point	 s 	 lower 	 	than	the	 average 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	before	.
all	the	rest	went	to	the	top	one	percent	.
so	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	down	to	0.8	.
and	that	0.8	is	the	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
are	we	going	to	grow	at	0.8	?
if	so	,	that	's	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	that	our	 invent 	 ions 	 	are	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	over	the	last	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	see	what	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 invent 	 ions 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	read	in	1875	at	night	,	you	 need 	 ed 	 	to	have	an	oil	or	a	gas	lamp	.
they	 create 	 d 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	they	 create 	 d 	 	 odor 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	hard	to	control	,	the	light	was	 d 	 im 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	a	fire	hazard	.
by	1929	,	electric	light	was	 every 	 where 	 	.
we	had	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	city	,	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	.
central	manhattan	 be 	 came 	 	possible	.
and	then	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	,	at	the	same	time	,	hand	 tool 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	by	massive	electric	 tool 	 s 	 	and	hand	-	powered	electric	 tool 	 s 	 	,	all	 achiev 	 ed 	 	by	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
 electric 	 ity 	 	was	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	in	 liber 	 ating 	 	women	.
women	,	back	in	the	late	19th	century	,	 s 	 pent 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 laundr 	 y 	 	.
they	did	it	on	a	scrub	board	.
then	they	had	to	hang	the	 clothe 	 s 	 	out	to	dry	.
then	they	had	to	 br 	 ing 	 	them	in	.
the	whole	thing	took	two	 day 	 s 	 	out	of	the	seven	-	day	week	.
and	then	we	had	the	electric	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	.
and	by	1950	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
but	the	women	still	had	to	shop	every	day	,	but	no	they	did	n't	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	us	the	electric	 refrige 	 rator 	 	.
back	in	the	late	19th	century	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	source	of	heat	in	most	 home 	 s 	 	was	a	big	 fire 	 place 	 	in	the	kitchen	that	was	used	for	 cook 	 ing 	 	and	 heat 	 ing 	 	.
the	 bed 	 rooms 	 	 we 	 re 	 	cold	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 heated 	 	.
but	by	1929	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	by	1950	,	we	had	central	 heat 	 ing 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
what	about	the	internal	 com 	 bust 	 ion 	 	engine	,	which	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	1879	?
in	america	,	before	the	motor	vehicle	,	 transport 	 ation 	 	 depend 	 ed 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	on	the	urban	horse	,	which	 drop 	 ped 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	restraint	,	25	to	50	 pound 	 s 	 	of	 man 	 ure 	 	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	every	day	together	with	a	gallon	of	 urin 	 e 	 	.
that	 come 	 s 	 	out	at	five	to	10	 ton 	 s 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	per	square	mile	in	cities	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 horse 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	ate	up	fully	one	quarter	of	american	 agricultur 	 al 	 	land	.
that	's	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	american	 agricultur 	 al 	 	land	it	took	to	feed	the	 horse 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	when	the	motor	vehicle	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	 be 	 came 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	by	1929	,	that	 agricultur 	 al 	 	land	could	be	used	for	human	consumption	or	for	export	.
and	here	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	ratio	:	 start 	 ing 	 	from	zero	in	1900	,	 on 	 ly 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	ratio	of	motor	 vehicle 	 s 	 	to	the	number	of	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	90	percent	in	just	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
back	before	the	turn	of	the	century	,	women	had	 an 	 other 	 	problem	.
all	the	water	for	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	 clean 	 ing 	 	and	 bath 	 ing 	 	had	to	be	carried	in	 buck 	 et 	 s 	 	and	 pa 	 il 	 s 	 	in	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
it	's	a	 historic 	 al 	 	fact	that	in	1885	,	the	average	north	carolina	 house 	 wife 	 	 walk 	 ed 	 	148	 mile 	 s 	 	a	year	 carry 	 ing 	 	35	 ton 	 s 	 	of	water	.
but	by	1929	,	cities	around	the	country	had	put	in	 under 	 ground 	 	water	 pipe 	 s 	 	.
they	had	put	in	 under 	 ground 	 	 sew 	 er 	 	 pipe 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	one	of	the	great	 scour 	 ge 	 s 	 	of	the	late	19th	century	,	 water 	 borne 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	like	cholera	,	 beg 	 an 	 	to	disappear	.
and	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	fact	for	techno	-	 optimist 	 s 	 	is	that	in	the	first	half	of	the	20th	century	,	the	rate	of	 improve 	 ment 	 	of	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	was	three	 time 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	it	was	in	the	second	half	of	the	19th	century	.
so	it	's	a	truism	that	 thing 	 s 	 	ca	n't	be	more	than	100	percent	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	i	'll	just	give	you	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
we	went	from	one	percent	to	90	percent	of	the	speed	of	sound	.
 electr 	 ification 	 	,	central	heat	,	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	motor	 car 	 s 	 	,	they	all	went	from	zero	to	100	percent	.
urban	 environment 	 s 	 	make	people	more	productive	than	on	the	farm	.
we	went	from	25	percent	urban	to	75	percent	by	the	early	 post 	 war 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
what	about	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	revolution	?
here	's	an	early	computer	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	the	 main 	 frame 	 	computer	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	1942	.
by	1960	we	had	 tele 	 phone 	 	 bill 	 s 	 	,	bank	 state 	 ments 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 computer 	 s 	 	.
the	 ear 	 liest 	 	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	,	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	personal	 computer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	the	1970s	.
the	1980s	 br 	 ought 	 	us	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	,	dos	,	atm	 machine 	 s 	 	to	replace	bank	 teller 	 s 	 	,	bar	code	 s 	 canning 	 	to	cut	down	on	labor	in	the	 re 	 tail 	 	sector	.
fast	forward	through	the	'90s	,	we	had	the	 dot 	 com 	 	revolution	and	a	 tempor 	 ary 	 	rise	in	 product 	 ivity 	 	growth	.
but	i	'm	now	going	to	give	you	an	experiment	.
you	have	to	 choos 	 e 	 	either	option	a	or	option	b	.
option	a	is	you	get	to	keep	 every 	 thing 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	up	till	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	you	get	google	,	you	get	amazon	,	you	get	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	and	you	get	running	water	and	 in 	 door 	 	 toilet 	 s 	 	.
or	you	get	 every 	 thing 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	to	 yester 	 day 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	facebook	and	your	iphone	,	but	you	have	to	give	up	,	go	out	to	the	 out 	 house 	 	,	and	carry	in	the	water	.
hurricane	 sand 	 y 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	people	to	lose	the	20th	century	,	 may 	 be 	 	for	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	for	more	than	a	week	,	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	running	water	,	 heat 	 ing 	 	,	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	a	charge	for	 the 	 ir 	 	iphones	.
the	problem	we	face	is	that	all	these	great	 invent 	 ions 	 	,	we	have	to	match	them	in	the	future	,	and	my	 predict 	 ion 	 	that	we	're	not	going	to	match	them	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	down	from	the	original	two	-	percent	growth	down	to	0.2	,	the	 fanci 	 ful 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	that	i	drew	you	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
so	here	we	are	back	to	the	horse	and	 bug 	 gy 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	 a 	 ward 	 	an	oscar	to	the	 inventor 	 s 	 	of	the	20th	century	,	the	people	from	alexander	graham	bell	to	thomas	edison	to	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	call	them	all	up	here	,	and	they	're	going	to	call	back	to	you	.
your	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	,	can	you	match	what	we	 achiev 	 ed 	 	?
thank	you	.
