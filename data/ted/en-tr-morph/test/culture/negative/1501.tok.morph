i	'm	a	 gam 	 er 	 	,	so	i	like	to	have	 goal 	 s 	 	.
i	like	special	 mission 	 s 	 	and	secret	 object 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
so	here	's	my	special	mission	for	 th 	 is 	 	talk	:	i	'm	going	to	try	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	life	span	of	every	single	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	by	seven	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	.
 liter 	 ally 	 	,	you	will	live	seven	and	half	 minute 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	than	you	would	have	 other 	 wise 	 	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 watch 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	some	of	you	are	looking	a	little	bit	 skeptic 	 al 	 	.
that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	check	it	out	--	i	have	math	to	prove	that	it	is	possible	.
and	it	wo	n't	make	a	lot	of	sense	now	.
i	'll	explain	it	all	 lat 	 er 	 	,	just	pay	attention	to	the	number	at	the	bottom	:	plus	-	7.68245837	 minute 	 s 	 	that	will	be	my	gift	to	you	if	i	'm	 success 	 ful 	 	in	my	mission	.
now	,	you	have	a	secret	mission	too	.
your	mission	is	to	figure	out	how	you	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	your	extra	seven	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	you	should	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	with	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	 bon 	 us 	 	 minute 	 s 	 	.	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	have	them	 any 	 way 	 	.
now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	a	game	 design 	 er 	 	,	you	might	be	 think 	 ing 	 	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	i	know	what	she	 want 	 s 	 	us	to	do	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 minute 	 s 	 	,	she	 want 	 s 	 	us	to	 s 	 pend 	 	them	 play 	 ing 	 	 game 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 total 	 ly 	 	 reason 	 able 	 	assumption	,	 give 	 n 	 	that	i	have	made	 quit 	 e 	 	a	habit	of	 encourag 	 ing 	 	people	to	 s 	 pend 	 	more	time	 play 	 ing 	 	 game 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	my	first	tedtalk	,	i	did	 pro 	 pose 	 	that	we	should	 s 	 pend 	 	21	billion	 hour 	 s 	 	a	week	 a 	 s 	 	a	planet	 play 	 ing 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	.
now	,	21	billion	 hour 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	lot	of	time	.
it	's	so	much	time	,	in	fact	,	that	the	number	one	 un 	 solicit 	 ed 	 	comment	that	i	have	heard	from	people	all	over	the	world	since	i	 g 	 ave 	 	that	talk	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	jane	,	 game 	 s 	 	are	great	and	all	,	but	on	your	 death 	 bed 	 	,	are	you	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	wish	you	 s 	 pent 	 	more	time	 play 	 ing 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	idea	is	so	pervasive	--	that	 game 	 s 	 	are	a	waste	of	time	that	we	will	come	to	regret	--	that	i	hear	it	 liter 	 ally 	 	 every 	 where 	 	i	go	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	true	story	:	just	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	 th 	 is 	 	cab	driver	,	 up 	 on 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	out	that	a	friend	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	in	town	for	a	game	 develop 	 er 	 	's	 con 	 ference 	 	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	and	 s 	 aid 	 	--	and	i	quote	--	``	i	hate	 game 	 s 	 	.	waste	of	life	.	imagine	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	end	of	your	life	and	 regret 	 ting 	 	all	that	time	.	``
now	,	i	want	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	problem	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	want	 game 	 s 	 	to	be	a	force	for	good	in	the	world	.
i	do	n't	want	 gam 	 ers 	 	to	regret	the	time	they	 s 	 pent 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	,	time	that	i	 encourag 	 ed 	 	them	to	 s 	 pend 	 	.
so	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	question	a	lot	 late 	 ly 	 	.
when	we	're	on	our	 death 	 bed 	 s 	 	,	will	we	regret	the	time	we	 s 	 pent 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 game 	 s 	 	?
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	may	surprise	you	,	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	some	scientific	research	on	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
it	's	true	.	 ho 	 spice 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	,	the	people	who	take	care	of	us	at	the	end	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 issue 	 d 	 	a	report	on	the	most	 frequent 	 ly 	 	 express 	 ed 	 	 regret 	 s 	 	that	people	say	when	they	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 death 	 bed 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	i	want	to	share	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	--	the	top	five	 regret 	 s 	 	of	the	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
number	one	:	i	wish	i	had	n't	 work 	 ed 	 	so	hard	.
number	two	:	i	wish	i	had	 stay 	 ed 	 	in	touch	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
number	three	:	i	wish	i	had	let	 my 	 self 	 	be	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	.
number	four	:	i	wish	i	'd	had	the	courage	to	express	my	true	self	.
and	number	five	:	i	wish	i	'd	lived	a	life	true	to	my	 dream 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	what	 other 	 s 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	of	me	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	know	,	no	one	ever	told	one	of	the	 ho 	 spice 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	,	i	wish	i	'd	 s 	 pent 	 	more	time	 play 	 ing 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	,	but	when	i	hear	these	top	five	 regret 	 s 	 	of	the	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	i	ca	n't	help	but	hear	five	deep	human	 crav 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	 game 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	help	us	fulfill	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	wish	i	had	n't	 work 	 ed 	 	so	hard	.
for	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	i	wish	i	'd	 s 	 pent 	 	more	time	with	my	family	,	with	my	 kid 	 s 	 	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	growing	up	.
well	,	we	know	that	 play 	 ing 	 	 game 	 s 	 	together	 ha 	 s 	 	tremendous	family	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
a	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	from	brigham	young	university	school	of	family	life	 report 	 ed 	 	that	 parent 	 s 	 	who	 s 	 pend 	 	more	time	 play 	 ing 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	have	much	 strong 	 er 	 	real	-	life	 relationship 	 s 	 	with	them	.
i	wish	i	'd	 stay 	 ed 	 	in	touch	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
well	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	use	social	 game 	 s 	 	like	farmville	or	 word 	 s 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	to	stay	in	 dai 	 ly 	 	contact	with	real	-	life	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	.
a	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	from	[	university	of	michigan	]	 show 	 ed 	 	that	these	 game 	 s 	 	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	relationship	-	management	 tool 	 s 	 	.
they	help	us	stay	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	people	in	our	social	network	that	we	would	 other 	 wise 	 	grow	 di 	 stant 	 	from	,	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 play 	 ing 	 	 game 	 s 	 	together	.
i	wish	i	'd	let	 my 	 self 	 	be	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	.
well	,	here	i	ca	n't	help	but	think	of	the	 ground 	 break 	 ing 	 	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	at	east	carolina	university	that	 show 	 ed 	 	that	 on 	 line 	 	 game 	 s 	 	can	 out 	 perform 	 	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	for	 treat 	 ing 	 	 clinic 	 al 	 	 anxie 	 ty 	 	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	.

i	wish	i	'd	had	the	courage	to	express	my	true	self	.
well	,	 avatar 	 s 	 	are	a	way	to	express	our	true	 s 	 elves 	 	,	our	most	 hero 	 ic 	 	,	 ideal 	 ized 	 	version	of	who	we	might	 be 	 come 	 	.
you	can	see	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	alter	ego	portrait	by	robbie	cooper	of	a	 gam 	 er 	 	with	his	avatar	.
and	stanford	university	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	research	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	now	to	document	how	 play 	 ing 	 	a	game	with	an	 ideal 	 ized 	 	avatar	 change 	 s 	 	how	we	think	and	act	in	real	life	,	making	us	more	 courage 	 ous 	 	,	more	 ambit 	 ious 	 	,	more	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	our	 goal 	 s 	 	.
i	wish	i	'd	led	a	life	true	to	my	 dream 	 s 	 	,	and	not	what	 other 	 s 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	of	me	.
are	 game 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	yet	?	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	,	so	i	've	left	a	question	mark	,	a	super	mario	question	mark	.
and	we	're	going	to	come	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
but	in	the	mean	time	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	you	're	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	game	 design 	 er 	 	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	us	about	 death 	 bed 	 	 regret 	 s 	 	?
and	it	's	true	,	i	've	never	 work 	 ed 	 	in	a	 ho 	 spice 	 	,	i	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	on	my	 death 	 bed 	 	.
but	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	i	did	 s 	 pend 	 	three	 month 	 s 	 	in	bed	,	 want 	 ing 	 	to	die	.
 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ing 	 	to	die	.
now	let	me	tell	you	that	story	.
it	 start 	 ed 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	hit	my	head	and	got	a	 concuss 	 ion 	 	.
now	the	 concuss 	 ion 	 	did	n't	heal	 proper 	 ly 	 	,	and	after	30	 day 	 s 	 	i	was	left	with	 symptom 	 s 	 	like	 non 	 stop 	 	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	,	 nause 	 a 	 	,	 vert 	 i 	 go 	 	,	 memor 	 y 	 	loss	,	mental	fog	.
my	doctor	told	me	that	in	order	to	heal	my	brain	,	i	had	to	rest	it	.
so	i	had	to	avoid	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 trigger 	 ed 	 	my	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
for	me	that	 me 	 ant 	 	no	 read 	 ing 	 	,	no	writing	,	no	video	 game 	 s 	 	,	no	work	or	email	,	no	running	,	no	alcohol	,	no	 c 	 affe 	 ine 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	--	and	i	think	you	see	where	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	--	no	reason	to	live	.
of	course	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	funny	,	but	in	all	 serious 	 ness 	 	,	 sui 	 cidal 	 	 ide 	 ation 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	common	with	 trauma 	 tic 	 	brain	 inju 	 ries 	 	.
it	 happen 	 s 	 	to	one	in	three	,	and	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
my	brain	 start 	 ed 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	,	jane	,	you	want	to	die	.
it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	're	never	going	to	get	better	.
it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	pain	will	never	end	.
and	these	 voice 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	so	 persist 	 ent 	 	and	so	 persuas 	 ive 	 	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 legitimate 	 ly 	 	fear	for	my	life	,	which	is	the	time	that	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	after	34	 day 	 s 	 	--	and	i	will	never	forget	 th 	 is 	 	moment	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	am	either	going	to	kill	 my 	 self 	 	or	i	'm	going	to	turn	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	game	.
now	,	why	a	game	?
i	 k 	 new 	 	from	 research 	 ing 	 	the	 psycho 	 logy 	 	of	 game 	 s 	 	for	more	than	a	decade	that	when	we	play	a	game	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	scientific	 liter 	 ature 	 	--	we	tackle	tough	 challeng 	 es 	 	with	more	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	more	 determi 	 nation 	 	,	more	 optim 	 ism 	 	,	and	we	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	reach	out	to	 other 	 s 	 	for	help	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	these	 gam 	 er 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	to	my	real	-	life	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	so	i	 create 	 d 	 	a	role	-	 play 	 ing 	 	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	game	 call 	 ed 	 	jane	the	 concuss 	 ion 	 	 s 	 layer 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	my	new	secret	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	and	the	first	thing	i	did	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 layer 	 	was	call	my	 t 	 win 	 	sister	--	i	have	an	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 	sister	named	kelly	--	and	tell	her	,	i	'm	 play 	 ing 	 	a	game	to	heal	my	brain	,	and	i	want	you	to	play	with	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 eas 	 ier 	 	way	to	ask	for	help	.
she	 be 	 came 	 	my	first	ally	in	the	game	,	my	husband	kiyash	 join 	 ed 	 	next	,	and	together	we	identified	and	 battle 	 d 	 	the	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	was	 any 	 thing 	 	that	could	trigger	my	 symptom 	 s 	 	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 s 	 low 	 	down	the	 heal 	 ing 	 	process	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	bright	 light 	 s 	 	and	 crowd 	 ed 	 	 space 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	and	 activate 	 d 	 	power	-	 up 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 any 	 thing 	 	i	could	do	on	even	my	worst	day	to	feel	just	a	little	bit	good	,	just	a	little	bit	productive	.
 thing 	 s 	 	like	 cuddl 	 ing 	 	my	dog	for	10	 minute 	 s 	 	,	or	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	bed	and	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	the	block	just	once	.
now	the	game	was	that	simple	:	adopt	a	secret	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	recruit	your	 al 	 lies 	 	,	battle	the	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	,	activate	the	power	-	 up 	 s 	 	.
but	even	with	a	game	so	simple	,	 with 	 in 	 	just	a	couple	 day 	 s 	 	of	 start 	 ing 	 	to	play	,	that	fog	of	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	 anxie 	 ty 	 	went	away	.	it	just	 vanish 	 ed 	 	.	it	felt	like	a	miracle	.
now	it	was	n't	a	miracle	cure	for	the	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	or	the	cognitive	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
that	 last 	 ed 	 	for	more	than	a	year	,	and	it	was	the	 hard 	 est 	 	year	of	my	life	by	far	.
but	even	when	i	still	had	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	even	while	i	was	still	in	pain	,	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
now	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	next	with	the	game	 surprise 	 d 	 	me	.
i	put	up	some	blog	 post 	 s 	 	and	 video 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	 explain 	 ing 	 	how	to	play	.
but	not	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 concuss 	 ion 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	not	 every 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	``	the	 s 	 layer 	 	,	``	so	i	 re 	 named 	 	the	game	superbetter	.
and	soon	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	from	people	all	over	the	world	who	 we 	 re 	 	 adopt 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	secret	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	 recruit 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 al 	 lies 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	``	super	better	``	facing	 challeng 	 es 	 	like	cancer	and	chronic	pain	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	crohn	's	disease	.
even	people	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	it	for	terminal	 diagnos 	 es 	 	like	als	.
and	i	could	tell	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 video 	 s 	 	that	the	game	was	 help 	 ing 	 	them	in	the	same	ways	that	it	 help 	 ed 	 	me	.
they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 feel 	 ing 	 	 strong 	 er 	 	and	 brave 	 r 	 	.
they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 feel 	 ing 	 	better	 under 	 stood 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	.
and	they	even	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 feel 	 ing 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	pain	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 tack 	 ling 	 	the	 tough 	 est 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
now	at	the	time	,	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	what	is	going	on	here	?
i	mean	,	how	could	a	game	so	trivial	 inter 	 vene 	 	so	 power 	 fully 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	serious	,	and	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	life	-	and	-	death	,	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	?
i	mean	,	if	it	had	n't	 work 	 ed 	 	for	me	,	there	's	no	way	i	would	have	 believ 	 ed 	 	it	was	possible	.
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	's	some	science	here	too	.
some	people	get	 strong 	 er 	 	and	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	after	a	 trauma 	 tic 	 	event	.
and	that	's	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	us	.
the	game	was	 help 	 ing 	 	us	experience	what	 scientist 	 s 	 	call	post	-	 trauma 	 tic 	 	growth	,	which	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	hear	about	.
we	 usual 	 ly 	 	hear	about	post	-	 trauma 	 tic 	 	stress	 dis 	 order 	 	.
but	 scientist 	 s 	 	now	know	that	a	 trauma 	 tic 	 	event	 do 	 es 	 	n't	doom	us	to	suffer	 in 	 definite 	 ly 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	can	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 spring 	 board 	 	to	unleash	our	best	 qual 	 ities 	 	and	lead	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
here	are	the	top	five	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	with	post	-	 trauma 	 tic 	 	growth	say	:	my	 prior 	 ities 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	.	i	'm	not	 af 	 raid 	 	to	do	what	 make 	 s 	 	me	happy	.
i	feel	 close 	 r 	 	to	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	.
i	understand	 my 	 self 	 	better	.	i	know	who	i	 re 	 ally 	 	am	now	.
i	have	a	new	sense	of	meaning	and	purpose	in	my	life	.
i	'm	better	able	to	focus	on	my	 goal 	 s 	 	and	 dream 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sound	familiar	?
it	should	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	top	five	 trait 	 s 	 	of	post	-	 trauma 	 tic 	 	growth	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	direct	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	the	top	five	 regret 	 s 	 	of	the	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	right	?
it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	 some 	 how 	 	,	a	 trauma 	 tic 	 	event	can	 un 	 lock 	 	our	ability	to	lead	a	life	with	 few 	 er 	 	 regret 	 s 	 	.
but	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
how	do	you	get	from	trauma	to	growth	?
or	better	yet	,	is	there	a	way	to	get	all	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	post	-	 trauma 	 tic 	 	growth	 with 	 out 	 	the	trauma	,	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	hit	your	head	in	the	first	place	?
that	would	be	good	,	right	?
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	understand	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	better	,	so	i	 devour 	 ed 	 	the	scientific	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	and	here	's	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
there	are	four	 kind 	 s 	 	of	strength	,	or	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	that	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	post	-	 trauma 	 tic 	 	growth	,	and	there	are	 scientific 	 ally 	 	 valid 	 ated 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	you	can	do	every	day	to	build	up	these	four	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	need	a	trauma	to	do	it	.
now	,	i	could	tell	you	what	these	four	 type 	 s 	 	of	strength	are	,	but	i	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	you	experience	them	 first 	 hand 	 	.
i	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	we	all	start	building	them	up	together	right	now	.
so	here	's	what	we	're	going	to	do	.
we	're	going	to	play	a	quick	game	together	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	earn	 t 	 hose 	 	seven	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 bon 	 us 	 	life	that	i	 promise 	 d 	 	you	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
all	you	have	to	do	is	 success 	 fully 	 	complete	the	first	four	superbetter	 quest 	 s 	 	.
and	i	feel	like	you	can	do	it	.	i	have	confidence	in	you	.
so	,	 every 	 body 	 	ready	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	your	first	quest	.	here	we	go	.
pick	one	:	stand	up	and	take	three	 step 	 s 	 	,	or	make	your	 hand 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 fist 	 s 	 	,	raise	them	over	your	head	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	for	five	 second 	 s 	 	.	go	!
all	right	,	i	like	the	people	 do 	 ing 	 	both	.	you	are	 over 	 achiev 	 ers 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
well	 d 	 one 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	.	now	that	is	worth	plus	-	one	physical	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	your	body	can	 with 	 stand 	 	more	stress	and	heal	 it 	 self 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	.
now	we	know	from	the	research	that	the	number	one	thing	you	can	do	to	boost	your	physical	 resili 	 ence 	 	is	to	not	 s 	 it 	 	still	.
that	's	all	it	 take 	 s 	 	.
every	single	second	that	you	are	not	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	still	,	you	are	 active 	 ly 	 	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	health	of	your	heart	,	and	your	 lung 	 s 	 	and	 brain 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	ready	for	your	next	quest	?
i	want	you	to	snap	your	 finger 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	50	 time 	 s 	 	,	or	count	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	from	100	by	seven	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	100	,	93	...
go	!
do	n't	give	up	.
do	n't	let	the	people	 count 	 ing 	 	down	from	100	interfere	with	your	 count 	 ing 	 	to	50	.
nice	.	 w 	 ow 	 	.	that	's	the	first	time	i	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	that	.
 bon 	 us 	 	physical	 resili 	 ence 	 	.	well	 d 	 one 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	.
now	that	's	worth	plus	-	one	mental	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	you	have	more	mental	focus	,	more	discipline	,	 determi 	 nation 	 	and	 will 	 power 	 	.
we	know	from	the	scientific	research	that	 will 	 power 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	like	a	muscle	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	 strong 	 er 	 	the	more	you	 exercis 	 e 	 	it	.
so	 tack 	 ling 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	 with 	 out 	 	giving	up	,	even	one	 a 	 s 	 	absurd	 a 	 s 	 	 snap 	 ping 	 	your	 finger 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	50	 time 	 s 	 	or	 count 	 ing 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	from	100	by	seven	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 scientific 	 ally 	 	 valid 	 ated 	 	way	to	boost	your	 will 	 power 	 	.
so	good	job	.	quest	number	three	.
pick	one	:	now	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	room	we	're	in	,	fate	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 determine 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	you	,	but	here	are	the	two	 option 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	 in 	 side 	 	,	find	a	window	and	look	out	of	it	.
if	you	're	 out 	 side 	 	,	find	a	window	and	look	in	.
or	do	a	quick	youtube	or	google	image	search	for	``	baby	[	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	animal	.	]	``	now	,	you	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	on	your	 phone 	 s 	 	,	or	you	could	just	shout	out	some	baby	 animal 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	find	some	and	put	them	on	the	screen	for	us	.
so	,	what	do	we	want	to	see	?
 s 	 lo 	 th 	 	,	giraffe	,	elephant	,	snake	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	let	's	see	what	we	got	.
baby	dolphin	and	baby	 llama 	 s 	 	.	 every 	 body 	 	look	.
got	that	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	one	more	.	baby	elephant	.
we	're	 clap 	 ping 	 	for	that	?
that	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
all	right	,	now	what	we	're	just	 feel 	 ing 	 	there	is	plus	-	one	 emotion 	 al 	 	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	you	have	the	ability	to	 provok 	 e 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	positive	 emotion 	 s 	 	like	curiosity	or	love	,	which	we	feel	when	we	look	at	baby	 animal 	 s 	 	,	when	you	need	them	most	.
and	here	's	a	secret	from	the	scientific	 liter 	 ature 	 	for	you	.
if	you	can	manage	to	experience	three	positive	 emotion 	 s 	 	for	every	one	negative	emotion	over	the	course	of	an	hour	,	a	day	,	a	week	,	you	 dramat 	 ically 	 	improve	your	health	and	your	ability	to	 success 	 fully 	 	tackle	any	problem	you	're	facing	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	three	-	to	-	one	positive	emotion	ratio	.
it	's	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	superbetter	trick	,	so	keep	it	up	.
all	right	,	pick	one	,	last	quest	:	shake	 some 	 one 	 	's	hand	for	six	 second 	 s 	 	,	or	 s 	 end 	 	 some 	 one 	 	a	quick	thank	you	by	text	,	email	,	facebook	or	twitter	.	go	!
looking	good	,	looking	good	.
nice	,	nice	.
keep	it	up	.	i	love	it	!
all	right	,	 every 	 body 	 	,	that	is	plus	-	one	social	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	more	strength	from	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	your	family	,	your	community	.
now	,	a	great	way	to	boost	social	 resili 	 ence 	 	is	 grat 	 itude 	 	.
touch	is	even	better	.
here	's	one	more	secret	for	you	:	 sha 	 king 	 	 some 	 one 	 	's	hand	for	six	 second 	 s 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 raise 	 s 	 	the	level	of	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	in	your	 blood 	 stream 	 	,	now	that	's	the	trust	hormone	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	all	of	you	who	just	 s 	 hook 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	are	 bio 	 chemical 	 ly 	 	 prim 	 ed 	 	to	like	and	want	to	help	each	other	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	linger	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	break	,	so	take	advantage	of	the	 network 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	well	you	have	 success 	 fully 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	your	four	 quest 	 s 	 	,	so	let	's	see	if	i	've	 success 	 fully 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	my	mission	to	give	you	seven	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 bon 	 us 	 	life	.
and	here	's	where	i	get	to	share	one	more	little	bit	of	science	with	you	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	people	who	 regular 	 ly 	 	boost	these	four	 type 	 s 	 	of	 resili 	 ence 	 	--	physical	,	mental	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	and	social	--	live	10	 year 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	than	 every 	 one 	 	else	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	.
if	you	are	 regular 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 ing 	 	the	three	-	to	-	one	positive	emotion	ratio	,	if	you	are	never	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	still	for	more	than	an	hour	at	a	time	,	if	you	are	 reach 	 ing 	 	out	to	one	person	you	care	about	every	single	day	,	if	you	are	 tack 	 ling 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	to	boost	your	 will 	 power 	 	,	you	will	live	10	 year 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	than	 every 	 one 	 	else	,	and	here	's	where	that	math	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	 ear 	 lier 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	.
so	,	the	average	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	in	the	u.s.	and	the	u.k.	is	78.1	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	we	know	from	more	than	1,000	peer	-	 review 	 ed 	 	scientific	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	you	can	add	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	life	to	that	by	 boost 	 ing 	 	your	four	 type 	 s 	 	of	 resili 	 ence 	 	.
so	every	single	year	that	you	are	 boost 	 ing 	 	your	four	 type 	 s 	 	of	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 earn 	 ing 	 	.128	more	 year 	 s 	 	of	life	or	46	more	 day 	 s 	 	of	life	,	or	67,298	more	 minute 	 s 	 	of	life	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	every	single	day	,	you	are	 earn 	 ing 	 	184	 minute 	 s 	 	of	life	,	or	every	single	hour	that	you	are	 boost 	 ing 	 	your	four	 type 	 s 	 	of	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	like	we	just	did	together	,	you	are	 earn 	 ing 	 	7.68245837	more	 minute 	 s 	 	of	life	.
 congratula 	 tions 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	seven	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	are	all	 your 	 s 	 	.	you	 total 	 ly 	 	 earn 	 ed 	 	them	.
 yea 	 h 	 	!	awesome	.
wait	,	wait	,	wait	.
you	still	have	your	special	mission	,	your	secret	mission	.
how	are	you	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	these	seven	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 bon 	 us 	 	life	?
well	,	here	's	my	 suggest 	 ion 	 	.
these	seven	and	a	half	 bon 	 us 	 	 minute 	 s 	 	are	kind	of	like	 gen 	 ie 	 	's	 wish 	 es 	 	.
you	can	use	your	first	wish	to	wish	for	a	million	more	 wish 	 es 	 	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	clever	,	right	?
so	,	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	these	seven	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	happy	,	or	that	 get 	 s 	 	you	 physical 	 ly 	 	active	,	or	 put 	 s 	 	you	in	touch	with	 some 	 one 	 	you	care	about	,	or	even	just	 tack 	 ling 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	you	are	going	to	boost	your	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	so	you	're	going	to	earn	more	 minute 	 s 	 	.
and	the	good	news	is	,	you	can	keep	going	like	that	.
every	hour	of	the	day	,	every	day	of	your	life	,	all	the	way	to	your	 death 	 bed 	 	,	which	will	now	be	10	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	than	it	would	have	 other 	 wise 	 	.
and	when	you	get	there	,	more	than	 like 	 ly 	 	,	you	will	not	have	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	top	five	 regret 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	will	have	built	up	the	strength	and	 resili 	 ence 	 	to	lead	a	life	 tru 	 er 	 	to	your	 dream 	 s 	 	.
and	with	10	extra	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	might	even	have	 en 	 ough 	 	time	to	play	a	few	more	 game 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
