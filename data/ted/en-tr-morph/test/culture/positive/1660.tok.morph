welcome	to	doha	.
i	am	in	charge	of	making	 th 	 is 	 	country	's	food	secure	.
that	is	my	job	for	the	next	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	to	design	an	entire	master	plan	,	and	then	for	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	to	implement	it	--	of	course	,	with	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	.
but	first	,	i	need	to	talk	to	you	about	a	story	,	which	is	my	story	,	about	the	story	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	that	you	're	all	here	in	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	of	course	,	most	of	you	have	had	three	 meal 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	have	after	 th 	 is 	 	event	.
so	going	in	,	what	was	qatar	in	the	1940s	?
we	 we 	 re 	 	about	11,000	people	living	here	.
there	was	no	water	.	there	was	no	energy	,	no	oil	,	no	 car 	 s 	 	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	that	.
most	of	the	people	who	lived	here	either	lived	in	 coast 	 al 	 	 village 	 s 	 	,	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	or	 we 	 re 	 	 nomad 	 s 	 	who	 roam 	 ed 	 	around	with	the	environment	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	water	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	the	glamour	that	you	see	 to 	 day 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
no	cities	like	you	see	 to 	 day 	 	in	doha	or	dubai	or	abu	dhabi	or	kuwait	or	riyadh	.
it	was	n't	that	they	could	n't	develop	cities	.
 resource 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	there	to	develop	them	.
and	you	can	see	that	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	was	 al 	 so 	 	short	.
most	people	 di 	 ed 	 	around	the	age	of	50	.
so	let	's	move	to	chapter	two	:	the	oil	era	.
1939	,	that	's	when	they	 discover 	 ed 	 	oil	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	fully	 exploit 	 ed 	 	 commercial 	 ly 	 	 un 	 til 	 	after	the	second	world	war	.
what	did	it	do	?
it	 change 	 d 	 	the	face	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	 to 	 day 	 	and	witness	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	made	all	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	 roam 	 ed 	 	around	the	desert	--	looking	for	water	,	looking	for	food	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	care	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 stock 	 	--	 urban 	 ize 	 	.
you	might	find	 th 	 is 	 	strange	,	but	in	my	family	we	have	different	 accent 	 s 	 	.
my	mother	 ha 	 s 	 	an	accent	that	is	so	different	to	my	father	,	and	we	're	all	a	population	of	about	300,000	people	in	the	same	country	.
there	are	about	five	or	six	 accent 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	 a 	 s 	 	i	speak	.
 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	how	so	?	how	could	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	we	lived	 scatter 	 ed 	 	.
we	could	n't	live	in	a	 concent 	 rated 	 	way	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	no	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	when	the	 resource 	 s 	 	came	,	be	it	oil	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	building	these	 f 	 ancy 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	people	together	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 need 	 ed 	 	the	 concent 	 ration 	 	.
people	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	to	know	each	other	.
and	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	are	some	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 accent 	 s 	 	.
so	that	is	the	chapter	two	:	the	oil	era	.
let	's	look	at	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 sky 	 line 	 	that	most	of	you	know	about	doha	.
so	what	's	the	population	 to 	 day 	 	?
it	's	1.7	million	people	.
that	is	in	less	than	60	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	average	growth	of	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	about	15	percent	for	the	past	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
 life 	 span 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	to	78	.
water	consumption	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	to	430	 liter 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 among 	 st 	 	the	highest	 world 	 wide 	 	.
from	 hav 	 ing 	 	no	water	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	to	 consum 	 ing 	 	water	to	the	highest	degree	,	 high 	 er 	 	than	any	other	nation	.
i	do	n't	know	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 re 	 action 	 	to	lack	of	water	.
but	what	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	the	story	that	i	've	just	 s 	 aid 	 	?
the	 interest 	 ing 	 	part	is	that	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	grow	15	percent	every	year	for	the	past	five	 year 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	water	.
now	that	is	historic	.	it	's	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
cities	 we 	 re 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	lack	of	water	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 histo 	 ry 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	made	in	 th 	 is 	 	region	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	cities	that	we	're	building	,	but	cities	with	 dream 	 s 	 	and	people	who	are	 wish 	 ing 	 	to	be	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
build	a	nice	home	,	 br 	 ing 	 	the	architect	,	design	my	house	.
these	people	are	adamant	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 liv 	 able 	 	space	when	it	was	n't	.
but	of	course	,	with	the	use	of	technology	.
so	brazil	 ha 	 s 	 	1,782	 millimeter 	 s 	 	per	year	of	 precipit 	 ation 	 	of	rain	.
qatar	 ha 	 s 	 	74	,	and	we	have	that	growth	rate	.
the	question	is	how	.
how	could	we	 surviv 	 e 	 	that	?
we	have	no	water	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 gig 	 antic 	 	,	 mamm 	 oth 	 	machine	 call 	 ed 	 	 de 	 s 	 al 	 in 	 ation 	 	.
energy	is	the	key	factor	here	.	it	 change 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
it	is	that	thing	that	we	pump	out	of	the	ground	,	we	burn	 ton 	 s 	 	of	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	most	of	you	used	it	coming	to	doha	.
so	that	is	our	lake	,	if	you	can	see	it	.
that	is	our	river	.
that	is	how	you	all	happen	to	use	and	enjoy	water	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	best	technology	that	 th 	 is 	 	region	could	ever	have	:	 de 	 s 	 al 	 in 	 ation 	 	.
so	what	are	the	 risk 	 s 	 	?
do	you	worry	much	?
i	would	say	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	if	you	look	at	the	global	 fact 	 s 	 	,	you	will	 real 	 ize 	 	,	of	course	i	have	to	worry	.
there	is	growing	demand	,	growing	population	.
we	've	 turn 	 ed 	 	seven	billion	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	so	that	number	 al 	 so 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	food	.
and	there	's	 predict 	 ions 	 	that	we	'll	be	nine	billion	by	2050	.
so	a	country	that	 ha 	 s 	 	no	water	 ha 	 s 	 	to	worry	about	what	 happen 	 s 	 	beyond	 it 	 s 	 	 border 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	changing	 diet 	 s 	 	.
by	 elev 	 ating 	 	to	a	 high 	 er 	 	socio	-	economic	level	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	change	 the 	 ir 	 	diet	.
they	start	eating	more	meat	and	so	on	and	so	forth	.
on	the	other	hand	,	there	is	 dec 	 lining 	 	 yield 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	climate	change	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	other	 factor 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 some 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	when	the	crisis	is	going	to	happen	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	qatar	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	n't	know	.
we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	two	 day 	 s 	 	of	water	 re 	 serve 	 	.
we	import	90	percent	of	our	food	,	and	we	 on 	 ly 	 	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	less	than	one	percent	of	our	land	.
the	 limit 	 ed 	 	number	of	 farm 	 ers 	 	that	we	have	have	 be 	 en 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	 practice 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	open	market	policy	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	big	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
so	we	 al 	 so 	 	face	 risk 	 s 	 	.
these	 risk 	 s 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	affect	the	 sustain 	 ability 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	nation	and	 it 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ity 	 	.
the	question	is	,	is	there	a	solution	?
is	there	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	solution	?
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	there	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	slide	 sum 	 s 	 	up	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 page 	 s 	 	of	technical	 document 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	over	the	past	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
let	's	start	with	the	water	.
so	we	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	--	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	 ear 	 lier 	 	--	that	we	need	 th 	 is 	 	energy	.
so	if	we	're	going	to	need	energy	,	what	sort	of	energy	?
a	 deple 	 table 	 	energy	?	fossil	fuel	?
or	should	we	use	 some 	 thing 	 	else	?
do	we	have	the	 compar 	 ative 	 	advantage	to	use	 an 	 other 	 	sort	of	energy	?
i	guess	most	of	you	by	now	 real 	 ize 	 	that	we	do	:	300	 day 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	so	we	will	use	that	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	to	produce	the	water	that	we	need	.
and	we	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	put	1,800	 megawatt 	 s 	 	of	solar	 system 	 s 	 	to	produce	3.5	million	cubic	 meter 	 s 	 	of	water	.
and	that	is	a	lot	of	water	.
that	water	will	go	then	to	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	and	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	will	be	able	to	water	 the 	 ir 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	,	and	they	will	be	able	then	to	supply	 socie 	 ty 	 	with	food	.
but	in	order	to	sustain	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	line	--	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	the	 project 	 s 	 	,	these	are	the	 system 	 s 	 	that	we	will	deliver	--	we	need	to	 al 	 so 	 	develop	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	line	:	system	 s 	 us 	 ten 	 ance 	 	,	high	-	level	education	,	research	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	,	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	to	produce	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	application	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	 market 	 s 	 	.
but	what	 gel 	 s 	 	all	of	it	,	what	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	it	,	is	 legisl 	 ation 	 	,	 poli 	 cies 	 	,	 regulat 	 ions 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	it	we	ca	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
so	that	's	what	we	are	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	do	.
 with 	 in 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	we	should	 hope 	 fully 	 	be	 d 	 one 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	plan	and	taking	it	to	 implement 	 ation 	 	.
our	 object 	 ive 	 	is	to	be	a	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	city	,	just	like	 man 	 y 	 	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	cities	around	:	istanbul	,	rome	,	london	,	paris	,	damascus	,	cairo	.
we	are	 on 	 ly 	 	60	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	but	we	want	to	live	 fore 	 ver 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	city	,	to	live	in	peace	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
