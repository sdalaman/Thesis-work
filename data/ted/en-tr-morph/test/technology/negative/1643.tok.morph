it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	be	here	to	talk	about	my	journey	,	to	talk	about	the	wheelchair	and	the	 free 	 dom 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	me	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	using	a	wheelchair	16	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	an	 extend 	 ed 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	i	could	access	the	world	.
when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	using	the	wheelchair	,	it	was	a	tremendous	new	 free 	 dom 	 	.
i	'd	 s 	 een 	 	my	life	slip	away	and	 be 	 come 	 	 restrict 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	enormous	new	 to 	 y 	 	.
i	could	whiz	around	and	feel	the	wind	in	my	face	 aga 	 in 	 	.
just	 be 	 ing 	 	out	on	the	street	was	 exhila 	 rating 	 	.
but	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 new 	 found 	 	joy	and	 free 	 dom 	 	,	people	's	 re 	 action 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	me	.
it	was	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	could	n't	see	me	 any 	 more 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	an	 in 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	cloak	had	 descend 	 ed 	 	.
they	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	see	me	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 assumption 	 s 	 	of	what	it	must	be	like	to	be	in	a	wheelchair	.
when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	 the 	 ir 	 	 associ 	 ations 	 	with	the	wheelchair	,	they	used	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	 limit 	 ation 	 	,	``	``	fear	,	``	``	 p 	 ity 	 	``	and	``	 restrict 	 ion 	 	.	``
i	 real 	 ized 	 	i	'd	 internal 	 ized 	 	these	 respons 	 es 	 	and	it	had	 change 	 d 	 	who	i	was	on	a	core	level	.
a	part	of	me	had	 be 	 come 	 	 alien 	 ated 	 	from	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	was	 see 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	not	from	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	but	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	and	 continu 	 ously 	 	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	other	people	's	 respons 	 es 	 	to	me	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	make	my	own	 st 	 ories 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	experience	,	new	 narrative 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 claim 	 	my	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
[	``	 find 	 ing 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	:	'	by	creating	our	own	 st 	 ories 	 	we	learn	to	take	the	 text 	 s 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	'	official	'	 narrative 	 s 	 	.	'	--	davis	2009	,	 ted 	 x 	 	women	``	]	i	 start 	 ed 	 	making	work	that	 aim 	 ed 	 	to	communicate	 some 	 thing 	 	of	the	joy	and	 free 	 dom 	 	i	felt	when	using	a	wheelchair	--	a	power	chair	--	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	the	world	.
i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	to	transform	these	 internal 	 ized 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	,	to	transform	the	 pre 	 conception 	 s 	 	that	had	so	shaped	my	 ident 	 ity 	 	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	using	a	wheelchair	,	by	creating	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 image 	 s 	 	.
the	wheelchair	 be 	 came 	 	an	object	to	paint	and	play	with	.
when	i	 liter 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	 trace 	 s 	 	of	my	joy	and	 free 	 dom 	 	,	it	was	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	see	the	 interest 	 ed 	 	and	 surprise 	 d 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	from	people	.
it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	open	up	new	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 in 	 	lay	the	paradigm	shift	.
it	 show 	 ed 	 	that	an	 art 	 s 	 	practice	can	 re 	 make 	 	one	's	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	transform	 pre 	 conception 	 s 	 	by	 re 	 vision 	 ing 	 	the	familiar	.
so	when	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 d 	 ive 	 	,	in	2005	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	scuba	gear	 extend 	 s 	 	your	range	of	activity	in	just	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	a	wheelchair	 do 	 es 	 	,	but	the	 associ 	 ations 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	scuba	gear	are	 one 	 s 	 	of	 excit 	 ement 	 	and	adventure	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	to	people	's	 respons 	 es 	 	to	the	wheelchair	.
so	i	thought	,	``	i	wonder	what	'll	happen	if	i	put	the	two	together	?	``
and	the	 under 	 water 	 	wheelchair	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 result 	 ed 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	me	on	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	journey	over	the	last	seven	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	to	give	you	an	idea	of	what	that	's	like	,	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	one	of	the	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	from	creating	 th 	 is 	 	 spect 	 acle 	 	,	and	show	you	what	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	journey	it	's	taken	me	on	.
it	is	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	experience	,	beyond	most	other	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	 experience 	 d 	 	in	life	.
i	 liter 	 ally 	 	have	the	 free 	 dom 	 	to	move	in	360	 degree 	 s 	 	of	space	and	an	 ec 	 static 	 	experience	of	joy	and	 free 	 dom 	 	.
and	the	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	thing	is	that	other	people	seem	to	see	and	feel	that	too	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	light	up	,	and	they	say	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	i	want	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	``	or	,	``	if	you	can	do	that	,	i	can	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``
and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	in	that	moment	of	them	 see 	 ing 	 	an	object	they	have	no	frame	of	 re 	 ference 	 	for	,	or	so	 transcend 	 s 	 	the	 frame 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ference 	 	they	have	with	the	wheelchair	,	they	have	to	think	in	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	way	.
and	i	think	that	moment	of	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	thought	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 create 	 s 	 	a	 free 	 dom 	 	that	 spread 	 s 	 	to	the	rest	of	other	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	.
for	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	they	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	value	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	the	joy	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	when	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	loss	or	 limit 	 ation 	 	,	we	see	and	discover	the	power	and	joy	of	 see 	 ing 	 	the	world	from	 excit 	 ing 	 	new	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
for	me	,	the	wheelchair	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	vehicle	for	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	now	call	the	 under 	 water 	 	wheelchair	``	 port 	 al 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	me	through	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	new	 dimension 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	level	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
and	the	other	thing	is	,	that	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	's	 s 	 een 	 	or	heard	of	an	 under 	 water 	 	wheelchair	before	,	and	creating	 th 	 is 	 	 spect 	 acle 	 	is	about	creating	new	ways	of	 see 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	and	 know 	 ing 	 	,	now	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	in	your	mind	.
you	're	all	part	of	the	 art 	 work 	 	too	.
