let	me	tell	you	a	story	.
it	's	my	first	year	 a 	 s 	 	a	new	high	school	science	teacher	,	and	i	'm	so	eager	.
i	'm	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	i	'm	 pour 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	 less 	 on 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	coming	to	 th 	 is 	 	 horr 	 ifying 	 	 real 	 ization 	 	that	my	 student 	 s 	 	just	might	not	be	 learn 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	one	day	:	i	'd	just	 assign 	 ed 	 	my	class	to	read	 th 	 is 	 	 text 	 book 	 	chapter	about	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	subject	in	all	of	biology	:	viruses	and	how	they	attack	.
and	so	i	'm	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	discuss	 th 	 is 	 	with	them	,	and	i	come	in	and	i	say	,	``	can	 some 	 body 	 	 pleas 	 e 	 	explain	the	main	 idea 	 s 	 	and	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	cool	?	``
there	's	silence	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	student	,	she	 look 	 s 	 	me	straight	in	the	eye	,	and	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	 read 	 ing 	 	 suck 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	then	she	 clar 	 ified 	 	.	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	,	i	do	n't	mean	that	it	 suck 	 s 	 	.	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	did	n't	understand	a	word	of	it	.
it	's	 bor 	 ing 	 	.	um	,	who	 care 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 suck 	 s 	 	.	``
these	 sym 	 pathetic 	 	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	spread	all	 through 	 out 	 	the	room	now	,	and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	all	of	my	other	 student 	 s 	 	are	in	the	same	boat	,	that	 may 	 be 	 	they	took	 note 	 s 	 	or	they	 memor 	 ized 	 	 definition 	 s 	 	from	the	 text 	 book 	 	,	but	not	one	of	them	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	the	main	 idea 	 s 	 	.
not	one	of	them	can	tell	me	why	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	so	cool	,	why	it	's	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	'm	 total 	 ly 	 	 clue 	 less 	 	.
i	have	no	idea	what	to	do	next	.
so	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	i	can	think	of	is	say	,	``	listen	.	let	me	tell	you	a	story	.
the	main	 character 	 s 	 	in	the	story	are	bacteria	and	viruses	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	blown	up	a	couple	million	 time 	 s 	 	.
the	real	bacteria	and	viruses	are	so	small	we	ca	n't	see	them	 with 	 out 	 	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	and	you	 guy 	 s 	 	might	know	bacteria	and	viruses	 be 	 cause 	 	they	both	make	us	sick	.
but	what	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	know	is	that	viruses	can	 al 	 so 	 	make	bacteria	sick	.	``
now	,	the	story	that	i	start	 tell 	 ing 	 	my	 kid 	 s 	 	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	out	like	a	 horr 	 or 	 	story	.
once	 up 	 on 	 	a	time	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	happy	little	 bacter 	 ium 	 	.
do	n't	get	too	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	him	.
 may 	 be 	 	he	's	 float 	 ing 	 	around	in	your	stomach	or	in	some	 spoil 	 ed 	 	food	 some 	 where 	 	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	he	 start 	 s 	 	to	not	feel	so	good	.
 may 	 be 	 	he	ate	 some 	 thing 	 	bad	for	lunch	,	and	then	 thing 	 s 	 	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	his	skin	 rip 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 ees 	 	a	virus	coming	out	from	his	 insid 	 es 	 	.
and	then	it	 get 	 s 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	when	he	 burst 	 s 	 	open	and	an	 arm 	 y 	 	of	viruses	 flood 	 s 	 	out	from	his	 insid 	 es 	 	.
if	--	ouch	is	right	!	--	if	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	're	a	 bacter 	 ium 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	your	worst	nightmare	.
but	if	you	're	a	virus	and	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	cross	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 leg 	 s 	 	of	 your 	 s 	 	and	you	think	,	``	we	rock	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	it	took	a	lot	of	 craft 	 y 	 	work	to	infect	 th 	 is 	 	 bacter 	 ium 	 	.
here	's	what	had	to	happen	.
a	virus	 grab 	 bed 	 	onto	a	 bacter 	 ium 	 	and	it	 s 	 lipped 	 	 it 	 s 	 	dna	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
the	next	thing	is	,	that	virus	dna	made	stuff	that	 chop 	 ped 	 	up	the	bacteria	dna	.
and	now	that	we	've	gotten	rid	of	the	bacteria	dna	,	the	virus	dna	 take 	 s 	 	control	of	the	cell	and	it	 tell 	 s 	 	it	to	start	making	more	viruses	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	see	,	dna	is	like	a	 blue 	 print 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	living	 thing 	 s 	 	what	to	make	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	like	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	car	 factor 	 y 	 	and	 re 	 placing 	 	the	 blue 	 print 	 s 	 	with	 blue 	 print 	 s 	 	for	killer	 robot 	 s 	 	.
the	 work 	 ers 	 	still	come	the	next	day	,	they	do	 the 	 ir 	 	job	,	but	they	're	 follow 	 ing 	 	different	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.
so	 re 	 placing 	 	the	bacteria	dna	with	virus	dna	 turn 	 s 	 	the	bacteria	 in 	 to 	 	a	 factor 	 y 	 	for	making	viruses	--	that	is	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	's	so	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	viruses	that	it	 burst 	 s 	 	.
but	that	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	viruses	infect	bacteria	.
some	are	much	more	 craft 	 y 	 	.
when	a	secret	agent	virus	 infect 	 s 	 	a	 bacter 	 ium 	 	,	they	do	a	little	 es 	 p 	 ion 	 age 	 	.
here	,	 th 	 is 	 	 cloak 	 ed 	 	,	secret	agent	virus	is	 slip 	 ping 	 	his	dna	 in 	 to 	 	the	bacterial	cell	,	but	here	's	the	 kick 	 er 	 	:	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	 harm 	 ful 	 	--	not	at	first	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	it	 silent 	 ly 	 	 slip 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	bacteria	's	own	dna	,	and	it	just	 stay 	 s 	 	there	like	a	terrorist	 sleep 	 er 	 	cell	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	 when 	 ever 	 	 th 	 is 	 	bacteria	 ha 	 s 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	virus	dna	in	them	.
so	now	we	have	a	whole	 extend 	 ed 	 	bacteria	family	,	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	virus	 sleep 	 er 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
they	're	just	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	living	together	 un 	 til 	 	a	signal	 happen 	 s 	 	and	--	 b 	 am 	 	!	--	all	of	the	dna	 pop 	 s 	 	out	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	control	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 s 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	virus	-	making	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	and	they	all	burst	,	a	huge	,	 extend 	 ed 	 	bacteria	family	,	all	 dy 	 ing 	 	with	viruses	 s 	 pill 	 ing 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 gut 	 s 	 	,	the	viruses	taking	over	the	 bacter 	 ium 	 	.
so	now	you	understand	how	viruses	can	attack	 cell 	 s 	 	.
there	are	two	ways	:	on	the	left	is	what	we	call	the	 ly 	 tic 	 	way	,	where	the	viruses	go	right	in	and	take	over	the	 cell 	 s 	 	.
on	the	[	right	]	is	the	 ly 	 so 	 genic 	 	way	that	uses	secret	agent	viruses	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	not	that	hard	,	right	?
and	now	all	of	you	understand	it	.
but	if	you	've	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	high	school	,	i	can	 al 	 most 	 	guarantee	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	before	.
but	i	bet	it	was	 present 	 ed 	 	in	a	way	that	it	did	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	stick	in	your	mind	.
so	when	my	 student 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	first	 learn 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	why	did	they	hate	it	so	much	?
well	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	couple	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	i	can	guarantee	you	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	did	n't	have	secret	agent	viruses	,	and	they	did	n't	have	 horr 	 or 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
you	know	,	in	the	communication	of	science	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	obsession	with	 serious 	 ness 	 	.
it	 kill 	 s 	 	me	.	i	'm	not	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
i	used	to	work	for	an	 education 	 al 	 	 publish 	 er 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	writer	,	i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	told	never	to	use	 st 	 ories 	 	or	 f 	 un 	 	,	 engag 	 ing 	 	language	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	my	work	might	not	be	 view 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	serious	``	and	``	scientific	.	``
right	?	i	mean	,	 be 	 cause 	 	god	forbid	 some 	 body 	 	have	 f 	 un 	 	when	they	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	science	.
so	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	field	of	science	that	's	all	about	 s 	 lime 	 	,	and	color	 change 	 s 	 	.	check	 th 	 is 	 	out	.
and	then	we	have	,	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	any	good	scientist	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	,	 explosion 	 s 	 	!
but	if	a	 text 	 book 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	too	much	 f 	 un 	 	,	it	's	 some 	 how 	 	 un 	 scientific 	 	.
now	 an 	 other 	 	problem	was	that	the	language	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 text 	 book 	 	was	 tru 	 ly 	 	 in 	 comprehens 	 ible 	 	.
if	we	want	to	summarize	that	story	that	i	told	you	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	we	could	start	by	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	``	these	viruses	make	copies	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	by	 slip 	 ping 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	 in 	 to 	 	a	 bacter 	 ium 	 	.	``
the	way	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	 text 	 book 	 	,	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	 bacter 	 io 	 phage 	 	 replica 	 tion 	 	is	 initi 	 ated 	 	through	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	viral	 nuclei 	 c 	 	acid	 in 	 to 	 	a	 bacter 	 ium 	 	.	``
that	's	great	,	perfect	for	13	-	year	-	olds	.
but	here	's	the	thing	.	there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	people	in	science	education	who	would	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	say	there	's	no	way	that	we	could	ever	give	that	to	 student 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 contain 	 s 	 	some	language	that	is	n't	 complete 	 ly 	 	accurate	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	told	you	that	viruses	have	dna	.
well	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	fraction	of	them	do	n't	.
they	have	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	rna	 in 	 stead 	 	.
so	a	professional	science	writer	would	circle	that	and	say	,	``	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	go	.
we	have	to	change	it	to	 some 	 thing 	 	much	more	technical	.	``
and	after	a	team	of	professional	science	 editor 	 s 	 	went	over	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	 explan 	 ation 	 	,	they	'd	find	fault	with	 al 	 most 	 	every	word	i	've	used	,	and	they	'd	have	to	change	 any 	 thing 	 	that	was	n't	serious	 en 	 ough 	 	,	and	they	'd	have	to	change	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	n't	100	percent	perfect	.
then	it	would	be	accurate	,	but	it	would	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	understand	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 horr 	 ifying 	 	.
you	know	,	i	keep	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	story	,	and	it	's	like	science	communication	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	on	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	what	i	call	the	 tyrann 	 y 	 	of	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	,	where	you	ca	n't	just	tell	a	story	.
it	's	like	science	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	that	 horr 	 ible 	 	 story 	 teller 	 	that	we	all	know	,	who	 give 	 s 	 	us	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 care 	 s 	 	about	,	where	you	're	like	,	``	oh	,	i	met	my	friend	for	lunch	the	other	day	,	and	she	was	 wear 	 ing 	 	these	 ug 	 ly 	 	 jean 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 jean 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	more	kind	of	,	like	,	 leg 	 ging 	 s 	 	,	but	,	like	,	i	guess	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	more	like	 j 	 egg 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	like	,	but	i	think	--	``	and	you	're	just	like	,	``	oh	my	god	.
what	is	the	point	?	``
or	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	science	education	is	 be 	 coming 	 	like	that	guy	who	 al 	 ways 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	.	``
right	?	you	want	to	be	like	,	``	oh	,	 du 	 de 	 	,	we	had	to	get	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night	and	drive	a	hundred	 mile 	 s 	 	in	total	 dark 	 ness 	 	.	``
and	that	guy	's	like	,	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	87.3	 mile 	 s 	 	.	``
and	you	're	like	,	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	shut	up	!
i	'm	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	a	story	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	good	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	is	all	about	 emotion 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
we	have	to	 con 	 vince 	 	our	audience	that	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 matter 	 s 	 	.
but	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	 know 	 ing 	 	which	 detail 	 s 	 	we	should	 leav 	 e 	 	out	so	that	the	main	point	still	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
i	'm	 re 	 minded 	 	of	what	the	architect	mies	van	der	rohe	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	i	 para 	 phrase 	 	,	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	have	to	lie	in	order	to	tell	the	truth	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	sentiment	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	relevant	to	science	education	.
now	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	am	often	so	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	when	people	think	that	i	'm	 advoc 	 ating 	 	a	 dumb 	 ing 	 	down	of	science	.
that	's	not	true	at	all	.
i	'm	 current 	 ly 	 	a	ph.d.	student	at	mit	,	and	i	 absolute 	 ly 	 	understand	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 detail 	 ed 	 	,	specific	scientific	communication	between	 expert 	 s 	 	,	but	not	when	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	teach	13	-	year	-	olds	.
if	a	young	 learn 	 er 	 	 think 	 s 	 	that	all	viruses	have	dna	,	that	's	not	going	to	ruin	 the 	 ir 	 	 chance 	 s 	 	of	success	in	science	.
but	if	a	young	 learn 	 er 	 	ca	n't	understand	 any 	 thing 	 	in	science	and	 learn 	 s 	 	to	hate	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	all	 sound 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	will	ruin	 the 	 ir 	 	 chance 	 s 	 	of	success	.
 th 	 is 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	stop	,	and	i	wish	that	the	change	could	come	from	the	 institution 	 s 	 	at	the	top	that	are	 perpetu 	 ating 	 	these	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	i	beg	them	,	i	beseech	them	to	just	stop	it	.
but	i	think	that	's	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	.
so	we	are	so	 luck 	 y 	 	that	we	have	 resource 	 s 	 	like	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	where	we	can	 circum 	 vent 	 	these	 institution 	 s 	 	from	the	bottom	up	.
there	's	a	growing	number	of	 on 	 line 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	that	are	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	just	 explain 	 ing 	 	science	in	simple	,	 understand 	 able 	 	ways	.
i	dream	of	a	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	-	like	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	would	explain	any	scientific	 con 	 cept 	 	you	can	think	of	in	simple	language	any	middle	 school 	 er 	 	can	understand	.
and	i	 my 	 self 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	free	time	making	these	science	 video 	 s 	 	that	i	put	on	youtube	.
i	explain	chemical	equilibrium	using	 analog 	 ies 	 	to	awkward	middle	school	 dance 	 s 	 	,	and	i	talk	about	fuel	 cell 	 s 	 	with	 st 	 ories 	 	about	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	at	a	summer	camp	.
the	 feed 	 back 	 	that	i	get	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 mis 	 spell 	 ed 	 	and	it	's	often	written	in	lolcats	,	but	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	it	's	so	 appreci 	 ative 	 	,	so	 thank 	 ful 	 	that	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	right	way	we	should	be	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	science	.
there	's	still	so	much	work	left	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	and	if	you	're	 involve 	 d 	 	with	science	in	any	way	i	urge	you	to	join	me	.
pick	up	a	camera	,	start	to	write	a	blog	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	but	 leav 	 e 	 	out	the	 serious 	 ness 	 	,	 leav 	 e 	 	out	the	 jar 	 gon 	 	.
make	me	laugh	.	make	me	care	.
 leav 	 e 	 	out	 t 	 hose 	 	 annoy 	 ing 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	 care 	 s 	 	about	and	just	get	to	the	point	.
how	should	you	start	?
why	do	n't	you	say	,	``	listen	,	let	me	tell	you	a	story	``	?
thank	you	.
