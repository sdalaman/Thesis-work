well	,	i	was	born	with	a	rare	visual	condition	 call 	 ed 	 	 ach 	 romatopsia 	 	,	which	is	total	color	 blind 	 ness 	 	,	so	i	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	color	,	and	i	do	n't	know	what	color	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	come	from	a	 gray 	 scale 	 	world	.
to	me	,	the	sky	is	 al 	 ways 	 	gray	,	 flower 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	gray	,	and	 tele 	 vision 	 	is	still	in	black	and	white	.
but	,	since	the	age	of	21	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 see 	 ing 	 	color	,	i	can	hear	color	.
in	2003	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	project	with	computer	scientist	adam	montandon	,	and	the	result	,	with	further	 collabor 	 ations 	 	with	peter	kese	from	slovenia	and	matias	lizana	from	barcelona	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	eye	.
it	's	a	color	sensor	that	 detect 	 s 	 	the	color	frequency	in	front	of	me	--	--	and	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	frequency	to	a	chip	 install 	 ed 	 	at	the	back	of	my	head	,	and	i	hear	the	color	in	front	of	me	through	the	bone	,	through	bone	 conduct 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	i	have	,	like	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sound	of	 pur 	 ple 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sound	of	grass	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	red	,	like	ted	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sound	of	a	 dirt 	 y 	 	sock	.
which	is	like	yellow	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	color	all	the	time	for	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	since	2004	,	so	i	find	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	normal	now	to	hear	color	all	the	time	.
at	the	start	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	had	to	 memor 	 ize 	 	the	 name 	 s 	 	you	give	for	each	color	,	so	i	had	to	 memor 	 ize 	 	the	 note 	 s 	 	,	but	after	some	time	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	information	 be 	 came 	 	a	 per 	 ception 	 	.
i	did	n't	have	to	think	about	the	 note 	 s 	 	.
and	after	some	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	have	 favor 	 ite 	 	 color 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	dream	in	 color 	 s 	 	.
so	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	dream	in	color	is	when	i	felt	that	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	and	my	brain	had	 unit 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	my	 dream 	 s 	 	,	it	was	my	brain	creating	 electron 	 ic 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	.	it	was	n't	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	so	that	's	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	feel	like	a	 cy 	 borg 	 	.
it	's	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	feel	that	the	 cyber 	 netic 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	 de 	 vice 	 	.
it	had	 be 	 come 	 	a	part	of	my	body	,	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	my	 sense 	 s 	 	,	and	after	some	time	,	it	even	 be 	 came 	 	a	part	of	my	official	image	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 pass 	 port 	 	from	2004	.
you	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	appear	on	u.k.	 pass 	 port 	 s 	 	with	 electron 	 ic 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	but	i	 insist 	 ed 	 	to	the	 pass 	 port 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	that	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	new	part	of	my	body	,	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	my	brain	,	and	they	 final 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	me	to	appear	with	the	 pass 	 port 	 	photo	.
so	,	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	since	i	hear	color	,	 be 	 cause 	 	color	is	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	so	the	 big 	 gest 	 	change	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	going	to	an	art	 gall 	 ery 	 	,	i	can	listen	to	a	picasso	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	so	it	's	like	i	'm	going	to	a	concert	hall	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	can	listen	to	the	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	,	i	find	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 shock 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	to	walk	 a 	 long 	 	a	 super 	 market 	 	.
it	's	like	going	to	a	 night 	 club 	 	.
it	's	full	of	different	 melo 	 dies 	 	.	 yea 	 h 	 	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	aisle	with	 clean 	 ing 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	fabulous	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	the	way	i	dress	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
before	,	i	used	to	dress	in	a	way	that	it	 look 	 ed 	 	good	.
now	i	dress	in	a	way	that	it	 sound 	 s 	 	good	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	 dress 	 ed 	 	in	c	major	,	so	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	happy	 chor 	 d 	 	.
if	i	had	to	go	to	a	funeral	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	would	dress	in	b	minor	,	which	would	be	turquoise	,	 pur 	 ple 	 	and	 o 	 range 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	food	,	the	way	i	look	at	food	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	i	can	 dis 	 play 	 	the	food	on	a	plate	,	so	i	can	eat	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	song	.
so	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	i	 dis 	 play 	 	it	,	i	can	hear	and	i	can	compose	music	with	food	.
so	imagine	a	restaurant	where	we	can	have	,	like	,	 lad 	 y 	 	gaga	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 start 	 ers 	 	.	i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	get	 teenager 	 s 	 	to	eat	 the 	 ir 	 	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	some	rachmaninov	piano	 concert 	 os 	 	 a 	 s 	 	main	 dish 	 es 	 	,	and	some	bjork	or	madonna	 dessert 	 s 	 	,	that	would	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	restaurant	where	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	eat	 song 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	the	way	i	perceive	 beaut 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	look	at	 some 	 one 	 	,	i	hear	 the 	 ir 	 	face	,	so	 some 	 one 	 	might	look	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	but	sound	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
and	it	might	happen	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	the	other	way	around	.	so	i	 re 	 ally 	 	enjoy	creating	,	like	,	sound	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	people	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 draw 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	's	face	,	like	 draw 	 ing 	 	the	shape	,	i	point	at	them	with	the	eye	and	i	write	down	the	different	 note 	 s 	 	i	hear	,	and	then	i	create	sound	 portrait 	 s 	 	.
here	's	some	 face 	 s 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	nicole	kidman	 sound 	 s 	 	good	.
some	people	,	i	would	never	 re 	 late 	 	,	but	they	sound	similar	.
prince	charles	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 similar 	 ities 	 	with	nicole	kidman	.
they	have	similar	sound	of	 eye 	 s 	 	.
so	you	 re 	 late 	 	people	that	you	would	n't	 re 	 late 	 	,	and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	create	 concert 	 s 	 	by	looking	at	the	audience	 face 	 s 	 	.
so	i	connect	the	eye	,	and	then	i	play	the	audience	's	 face 	 s 	 	.
the	good	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	if	the	concert	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sound	good	,	it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	fault	.
it	's	not	my	fault	,	 be 	 cause 	 	--	and	so	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 second 	 ary 	 	effect	that	normal	 sound 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	color	.
i	heard	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	tone	,	and	it	felt	green	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 sound 	 ed 	 	just	like	the	color	green	.
the	bbc	 beep 	 s 	 	,	they	sound	turquoise	,	and	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	mozart	 be 	 came 	 	a	yellow	experience	,	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	paint	music	and	paint	people	's	 voice 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	's	 voice 	 s 	 	have	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	that	i	 re 	 late 	 	to	color	.
and	here	's	some	music	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	color	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	mozart	,	``	 que 	 en 	 	of	the	night	,	``	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	yellow	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 color 	 ful 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 man 	 y 	 	different	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	song	.
it	's	justin	bieber	's	``	baby	.	``
it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	pink	and	 ver 	 y 	 	yellow	.
so	,	 al 	 so 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	,	i	can	transform	 speech 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	color	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	these	are	two	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	known	 speech 	 es 	 	.
one	of	them	is	martin	luther	king	's	``	i	have	a	dream	,	``	and	the	other	one	is	hitler	.
and	i	like	to	exhibit	these	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 hall 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 label 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	ask	people	,	``	which	one	do	you	prefer	?	``
and	most	people	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 pre 	 ference 	 	when	i	tell	them	that	the	one	on	the	left	is	hitler	and	the	one	on	the	right	is	martin	luther	king	.
so	i	got	to	a	point	when	i	was	able	to	perceive	360	 color 	 s 	 	,	just	like	human	vision	.
i	was	able	to	 different 	 iate 	 	all	the	 degree 	 s 	 	of	the	color	wheel	.
but	then	,	i	just	thought	that	 th 	 is 	 	human	vision	was	n't	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
there	's	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	more	 color 	 s 	 	around	us	that	we	can	not	perceive	,	but	that	 electron 	 ic 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	can	perceive	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 extend 	 ing 	 	my	color	 sense 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 add 	 ed 	 	 infra 	 red 	 	and	i	 add 	 ed 	 	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	to	the	color	-	to	-	sound	scale	,	so	now	i	can	hear	 color 	 s 	 	that	the	human	eye	can	not	perceive	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	 infra 	 red 	 	is	good	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	detect	if	there	's	 move 	 ment 	 	 detect 	 ors 	 	in	a	room	.
i	can	hear	if	 some 	 one 	 	 point 	 s 	 	at	me	with	a	remote	control	.
and	the	good	thing	about	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	is	that	you	can	hear	if	it	's	a	good	day	or	a	bad	day	to	 s 	 un 	 bath 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	is	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	color	,	a	color	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	kill	us	,	so	i	think	we	should	all	have	 th 	 is 	 	wish	to	perceive	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	not	perceive	.
that	's	why	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 create 	 d 	 	the	 cy 	 borg 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	a	 found 	 ation 	 	that	tries	to	help	people	 be 	 come 	 	a	 cy 	 borg 	 	,	tries	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	people	to	extend	 the 	 ir 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	by	using	technology	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	body	.
we	should	all	think	that	knowledge	 come 	 s 	 	from	our	 sense 	 s 	 	,	so	if	we	extend	our	 sense 	 s 	 	,	we	will	 con 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	extend	our	knowledge	.
i	think	life	will	be	much	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	when	we	stop	creating	 application 	 s 	 	for	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	and	we	start	creating	 application 	 s 	 	for	our	own	body	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	a	big	,	big	change	that	we	will	see	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
so	i	do	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	all	to	think	about	which	 sense 	 s 	 	you	'd	like	to	extend	.
i	would	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 cy 	 borg 	 	.
you	wo	n't	be	 al 	 one 	 	.	thank	you	.
