hi	.	so	,	 th 	 is 	 	chap	here	,	he	 think 	 s 	 	he	can	tell	you	the	future	.
his	name	is	nostradamus	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	here	the	 s 	 un 	 	have	made	him	look	a	little	bit	like	sean	connery	.
and	like	most	of	you	,	i	suspect	,	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	people	can	see	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 pre 	 cognition 	 	,	and	every	now	and	then	,	you	hear	that	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	predict	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	future	,	and	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	 flu 	 ke 	 	,	and	we	 on 	 ly 	 	hear	about	the	 flu 	 ke 	 s 	 	and	about	the	 freak 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	hear	about	all	the	 time 	 s 	 	that	people	got	stuff	wrong	.
now	we	expect	that	to	happen	with	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	about	 pre 	 cognition 	 	,	but	the	problem	is	,	we	have	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	problem	in	academia	and	in	medicine	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	environment	,	it	 cost 	 s 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	 first 	 ly 	 	,	 think 	 ing 	 	just	about	 pre 	 cognition 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	just	last	year	a	 research 	 er 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	daryl	bem	 conduct 	 ed 	 	a	piece	of	research	where	he	found	evidence	of	 pre 	 cognitive 	 	 power 	 s 	 	in	 under 	 graduate 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	a	peer	-	 review 	 ed 	 	academic	journal	and	most	of	the	people	who	read	 th 	 is 	 	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	well	,	fair	 en 	 ough 	 	,	but	i	think	that	's	a	 flu 	 ke 	 	,	that	's	a	freak	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	that	if	i	did	a	 stud 	 y 	 	where	i	found	no	evidence	that	 under 	 graduate 	 	 student 	 s 	 	had	 pre 	 cognitive 	 	 power 	 s 	 	,	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	n't	get	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	a	journal	.
and	in	fact	,	we	know	that	that	's	true	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	different	 group 	 s 	 	of	research	 scientist 	 s 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	replicate	the	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 pre 	 cognition 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	when	they	 submit 	 ted 	 	it	to	the	exact	same	journal	,	the	journal	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	we	're	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 publish 	 ing 	 	 replica 	 tion 	 	.	we	're	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	your	negative	data	.	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	evidence	of	how	,	in	the	academic	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	we	will	see	a	 bias 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ample 	 	of	the	true	picture	of	all	of	the	scientific	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	happen	in	the	dry	academic	field	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	cancer	research	.
so	in	march	,	2012	,	just	one	month	ago	,	some	 research 	 ers 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	in	the	journal	nature	how	they	had	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	replicate	53	different	 bas 	 ic 	 	science	 stud 	 ies 	 	looking	at	potential	 treat 	 ment 	 	 target 	 s 	 	in	cancer	,	and	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	53	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	able	to	 success 	 fully 	 	replicate	six	.
forty	-	seven	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	53	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 replica 	 ble 	 	.
and	they	say	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 freak 	 s 	 	get	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
people	will	do	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	and	the	 occasion 	 s 	 	when	it	 work 	 s 	 	they	will	publish	,	and	the	 one 	 s 	 	where	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	they	wo	n't	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 recommend 	 ation 	 	of	how	to	fix	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	a	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	us	all	down	blind	 al 	 ley 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 recommend 	 ation 	 	of	how	to	fix	 th 	 is 	 	problem	is	to	make	it	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	publish	negative	 result 	 s 	 	in	science	,	and	to	change	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	so	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 encourag 	 ed 	 	to	post	more	of	 the 	 ir 	 	negative	 result 	 s 	 	in	public	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	happen	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	dry	world	of	 pre 	 clinic 	 al 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	science	cancer	research	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	real	,	 fl 	 esh 	 	and	blood	of	academic	medicine	.	so	in	1980	,	some	 research 	 ers 	 	did	a	 stud 	 y 	 	on	a	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	lorcainide	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	anti	-	arrhythmic	drug	,	a	drug	that	 suppress 	 es 	 	 ab 	 normal 	 	heart	 rhythm 	 s 	 	,	and	the	idea	was	,	after	people	have	had	a	heart	attack	,	they	're	 quit 	 e 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	 ab 	 normal 	 	heart	 rhythm 	 s 	 	,	so	if	we	give	them	a	drug	that	 suppress 	 es 	 	 ab 	 normal 	 	heart	 rhythm 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 chance 	 s 	 	of	them	 surviv 	 ing 	 	.
early	on	 it 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	they	did	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	trial	,	just	under	a	hundred	 patient 	 s 	 	.
fifty	 patient 	 s 	 	got	lorcainide	,	and	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	,	10	 di 	 ed 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	50	 patient 	 s 	 	got	a	 d 	 um 	 my 	 	 place 	 bo 	 	sugar	pill	with	no	active	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	them	 di 	 ed 	 	.
so	they	 right 	 ly 	 	 regard 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	drug	 a 	 s 	 	a	failure	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	commercial	 develop 	 ment 	 	was	 stop 	 ped 	 	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	 it 	 s 	 	commercial	 develop 	 ment 	 	was	 stop 	 ped 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	trial	was	never	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	over	the	course	of	the	next	five	,	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	other	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	had	the	same	idea	about	 drug 	 s 	 	that	would	prevent	arrhythmias	in	people	who	have	had	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	.
these	 drug 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	market	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 scribed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	are	a	 ver 	 y 	 	common	thing	,	and	it	took	so	long	for	us	to	find	out	that	these	 drug 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	an	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	rate	of	death	that	before	we	 detect 	 ed 	 	that	 safe 	 ty 	 	signal	,	over	100,000	people	 di 	 ed 	 	 un 	 necess 	 arily 	 	in	america	from	the	prescription	of	anti	-	arrhythmic	 drug 	 s 	 	.
now	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	1993	,	the	 research 	 ers 	 	who	did	that	1980	 stud 	 y 	 	,	that	early	 stud 	 y 	 	,	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	mea	 cul 	 pa 	 	,	an	 apolog 	 y 	 	to	the	scientific	community	,	in	which	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	when	we	carried	out	our	 stud 	 y 	 	in	1980	,	we	thought	that	the	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	death	rate	that	 occur 	 red 	 	in	the	lorcainide	group	was	an	effect	of	chance	.	``
the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	lorcainide	was	 abandon 	 ed 	 	for	commercial	 reason 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	was	never	 publish 	 ed 	 	;	it	's	now	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 public 	 ation 	 	bias	.
that	's	the	technical	term	for	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	where	 un 	 flatter 	 ing 	 	data	 get 	 s 	 	lost	,	 get 	 s 	 	 un 	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	is	left	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	in	action	,	and	they	say	the	 result 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	here	``	might	have	 provide 	 d 	 	an	early	 war 	 ning 	 	of	trouble	 a 	 head 	 	.	``
now	these	are	 st 	 ories 	 	from	 bas 	 ic 	 	science	.
these	are	 st 	 ories 	 	from	20	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	academic	 publish 	 ing 	 	environment	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	now	.
there	are	academic	 journal 	 s 	 	like	``	 trial 	 s 	 	,	``	the	open	access	journal	,	which	will	publish	any	trial	 conduct 	 ed 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	 regard 	 less 	 	of	 whet 	 her 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	positive	or	a	negative	result	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	problem	of	negative	 result 	 s 	 	that	go	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	in	action	is	still	 ver 	 y 	 	 pre 	 valent 	 	.	in	fact	it	's	so	 pre 	 valent 	 	that	it	 cut 	 s 	 	to	the	core	of	evidence	-	based	medicine	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	 reboxet 	 ine 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	drug	that	i	 my 	 self 	 	have	 pre 	 scribed 	 	.	it	's	an	 anti 	 depress 	 ant 	 	.
and	i	'm	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 nerd 	 y 	 	doctor	,	so	i	read	all	of	the	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	i	could	on	 th 	 is 	 	drug	.	i	read	the	one	 stud 	 y 	 	that	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	that	 show 	 ed 	 	that	 reboxet 	 ine 	 	was	better	than	 place 	 bo 	 	,	and	i	read	the	other	three	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	that	 show 	 ed 	 	that	 reboxet 	 ine 	 	was	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	any	other	 anti 	 depress 	 ant 	 	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	patient	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	well	on	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	,	i	thought	,	well	,	 reboxet 	 ine 	 	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	.	it	's	one	to	try	.
but	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	i	was	 mis 	 led 	 	.	in	fact	,	seven	 trial 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	 compar 	 ing 	 	 reboxet 	 ine 	 	against	a	 d 	 um 	 my 	 	 place 	 bo 	 	sugar	pill	.	one	of	them	was	positive	and	that	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	but	six	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	negative	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	left	 un 	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
three	 trial 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	 compar 	 ing 	 	 reboxet 	 ine 	 	against	other	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	in	which	 reboxet 	 ine 	 	was	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	but	three	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	data	was	 collect 	 ed 	 	which	 show 	 ed 	 	that	 reboxet 	 ine 	 	was	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
i	felt	 mis 	 led 	 	.
now	you	might	say	,	well	,	that	's	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	and	i	would	n't	want	to	be	 guilt 	 y 	 	of	the	same	kind	of	 cher 	 ry 	 	-	 pick 	 ing 	 	and	 select 	 ive 	 	 refer 	 encing 	 	that	i	'm	 accus 	 ing 	 	other	people	of	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	 public 	 ation 	 	bias	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 stud 	 ied 	 	.
so	here	is	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	you	approach	it	.
the	classic	model	is	,	you	get	a	bunch	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	where	you	know	that	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	and	 complete 	 d 	 	,	and	then	you	go	and	see	if	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	academic	 liter 	 ature 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	took	all	of	the	 trial 	 s 	 	that	had	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	on	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	approved	over	a	15	-	year	period	by	the	fda	.
they	took	all	of	the	 trial 	 s 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	 submit 	 ted 	 	to	the	fda	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	approval	package	.
so	that	's	not	all	of	the	 trial 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	ever	 conduct 	 ed 	 	on	these	 drug 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	never	know	if	we	have	 t 	 hose 	 	,	but	it	is	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	in	order	to	get	the	 market 	 ing 	 	 author 	 ization 	 	.
and	then	they	went	to	see	if	these	 trial 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	the	peer	-	 review 	 ed 	 	academic	 liter 	 ature 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	found	.
it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	a	50-50	split	.	half	of	these	 trial 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	positive	,	half	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	negative	,	in	 re 	 ality 	 	.
but	when	they	went	to	look	for	these	 trial 	 s 	 	in	the	peer	-	 review 	 ed 	 	academic	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	what	they	found	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	picture	.
 on 	 ly 	 	three	of	the	negative	 trial 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	but	all	but	one	of	the	positive	 trial 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
now	if	we	just	flick	back	and	forth	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	,	you	can	see	what	a	 stagger 	 ing 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	there	was	between	 re 	 ality 	 	and	what	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 commission 	 ers 	 	of	health	 service 	 s 	 	,	and	 academic 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	see	in	the	peer	-	 review 	 ed 	 	academic	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 mis 	 led 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 system 	 atic 	 	flaw	in	the	core	of	medicine	.
in	fact	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	on	 public 	 ation 	 	bias	now	,	over	a	hundred	,	that	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	in	a	 system 	 atic 	 	review	,	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	2010	,	that	took	every	single	 stud 	 y 	 	on	 public 	 ation 	 	bias	that	they	could	find	.
 public 	 ation 	 	bias	 affect 	 s 	 	every	field	of	medicine	.
about	half	of	all	 trial 	 s 	 	,	on	average	,	go	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	in	action	,	and	we	know	that	positive	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	around	twice	 a 	 s 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 publish 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	negative	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cancer	at	the	core	of	evidence	-	based	medicine	.
if	i	 flip 	 ped 	 	a	 co 	 in 	 	100	 time 	 s 	 	but	then	 with 	 held 	 	the	 result 	 s 	 	from	you	from	half	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 to 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	,	i	could	make	it	look	 a 	 s 	 	if	i	had	a	 co 	 in 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	came	up	 head 	 s 	 	.
but	that	would	n't	mean	that	i	had	a	two	-	headed	 co 	 in 	 	.
that	would	mean	that	i	was	a	 chance 	 r 	 	and	you	 we 	 re 	 	an	idiot	for	 lett 	 ing 	 	me	get	away	with	it	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	 blind 	 ly 	 	 toler 	 ate 	 	in	the	whole	of	evidence	-	based	medicine	.
and	to	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	research	 mis 	 conduct 	 	.
if	i	 conduct 	 ed 	 	one	 stud 	 y 	 	and	i	 with 	 held 	 	half	of	the	data	 point 	 s 	 	from	that	one	 stud 	 y 	 	,	you	would	 right 	 ly 	 	 accus 	 e 	 	me	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	of	research	fraud	.
and	yet	,	for	some	reason	,	if	 some 	 body 	 	 conduct 	 s 	 	10	 stud 	 ies 	 	but	 on 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 es 	 	the	five	that	give	the	result	that	they	want	,	we	do	n't	consider	that	to	be	research	 mis 	 conduct 	 	.
and	when	that	 respons 	 ibility 	 	is	 diffuse 	 d 	 	between	a	whole	network	of	 research 	 ers 	 	,	 academic 	 s 	 	,	industry	 sponsor 	 s 	 	,	journal	 editor 	 s 	 	,	for	some	reason	we	find	it	more	 accept 	 able 	 	,	but	the	effect	on	 patient 	 s 	 	is	 damn 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	right	now	,	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	tamiflu	.	tamiflu	is	a	drug	which	 government 	 s 	 	around	the	world	have	 s 	 pent 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	 stock 	 pil 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	've	 stock 	 pil 	 ed 	 	tamiflu	in	panic	,	in	the	belief	that	it	will	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	rate	of	 complic 	 ations 	 	of	influenza	.
 complic 	 ations 	 	is	a	medical	 euphem 	 ism 	 	for	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	and	death	.
now	when	the	cochrane	 system 	 atic 	 	 review 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	collect	together	all	of	the	data	from	all	of	the	 trial 	 s 	 	that	had	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	on	 whet 	 her 	 	tamiflu	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	 th 	 is 	 	or	not	,	they	found	that	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
the	 result 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	them	.
and	when	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 obtain 	 ing 	 	the	 write 	 up 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	through	 vari 	 ous 	 	different	 mean 	 s 	 	,	through	 free 	 dom 	 	of	information	act	 request 	 s 	 	,	through	 harass 	 ing 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	different	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	what	they	found	was	 in 	 consist 	 ent 	 	.
and	when	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	a	hold	of	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 report 	 s 	 	,	the	10,000	-	page	long	 document 	 s 	 	that	have	the	best	possible	 rend 	 ition 	 	of	the	information	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	told	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	have	them	.
and	if	you	want	to	read	the	full	 correspond 	 ence 	 	and	the	 excuse 	 s 	 	and	the	 explan 	 ations 	 	 give 	 n 	 	by	the	drug	company	,	you	can	see	that	written	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	week	's	 ed 	 ition 	 	of	plos	medicine	.
and	the	most	 stagger 	 ing 	 	thing	of	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	me	,	is	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	problem	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	,	but	we	've	had	to	suffer	fake	 fix 	 es 	 	.
we	've	had	people	pretend	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	.
first	of	all	,	we	had	 trial 	 s 	 	 register 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	oh	,	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	we	'll	get	 every 	 one 	 	to	register	 the 	 ir 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	post	the	 proto 	 col 	 	,	they	'll	say	what	they	're	going	to	do	before	they	do	it	,	and	then	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	we	'll	be	able	to	check	and	see	if	all	the	 trial 	 s 	 	which	have	 be 	 en 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	and	 complete 	 d 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
but	people	did	n't	 both 	 er 	 	to	use	 t 	 hose 	 	 register 	 s 	 	.
and	so	then	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 commit 	 tee 	 	of	medical	journal	 editor 	 s 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	oh	,	well	,	we	will	hold	the	line	.
we	wo	n't	publish	any	 journal 	 s 	 	,	we	wo	n't	publish	any	 trial 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 less 	 	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 register 	 ed 	 	before	they	 beg 	 an 	 	.
but	they	did	n't	hold	the	line	.	in	2008	,	a	 stud 	 y 	 	was	 conduct 	 ed 	 	which	 show 	 ed 	 	that	half	of	all	of	 trial 	 s 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	by	 journal 	 s 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	by	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	icmje	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 proper 	 ly 	 	 register 	 ed 	 	,	and	a	quarter	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 register 	 ed 	 	at	all	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	fda	amendment	act	was	 pass 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	who	 conduct 	 s 	 	a	trial	must	post	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	that	trial	 with 	 in 	 	one	year	.
and	in	the	bmj	,	in	the	first	 ed 	 ition 	 	of	january	,	2012	,	you	can	see	a	 stud 	 y 	 	which	 look 	 s 	 	to	see	if	people	 ke 	 pt 	 	to	that	 rul 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 on 	 ly 	 	one	in	five	have	 d 	 one 	 	so	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	disaster	.
we	can	not	know	the	true	 effect 	 s 	 	of	the	 medicine 	 s 	 	that	we	 pre 	 scribe 	 	if	we	do	not	have	access	to	all	of	the	information	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	difficult	problem	to	fix	.
we	need	to	force	people	to	publish	all	 trial 	 s 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 old 	 er 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	fda	amendment	act	 on 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	that	you	publish	the	 trial 	 s 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	after	2008	,	and	i	do	n't	know	what	world	it	is	in	which	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	medicine	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 trial 	 s 	 	that	 complete 	 d 	 	in	the	past	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	publish	all	 trial 	 s 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 old 	 er 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	for	all	 drug 	 s 	 	in	current	use	,	and	you	need	to	tell	 every 	 one 	 	you	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	and	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
