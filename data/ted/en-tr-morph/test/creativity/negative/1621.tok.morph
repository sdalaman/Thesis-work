life	is	about	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	,	creating	them	and	 em 	 bracing 	 	them	,	and	for	me	,	that	was	the	olympic	dream	.
that	's	what	defined	me	.	that	was	my	 bli 	 s 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	cross	-	country	 ski 	 er 	 	and	member	of	the	australian	ski	team	,	headed	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	winter	olympics	,	i	was	on	a	training	bike	ride	with	my	fellow	 team 	 mate 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	made	our	way	up	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	spectacular	blue	 mountain 	 s 	 	west	of	sydney	,	it	was	the	perfect	 aut 	 umn 	 	day	:	 s 	 un 	 shine 	 	,	the	smell	of	eucalypt	and	a	dream	.
life	was	good	.
we	'd	 be 	 en 	 	on	our	 bike 	 s 	 	for	around	five	and	half	 hour 	 s 	 	when	we	got	to	the	part	of	the	ride	that	i	 love 	 d 	 	,	and	that	was	the	 hill 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 love 	 d 	 	the	 hill 	 s 	 	.
and	i	got	up	off	the	seat	of	my	bike	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 pump 	 ing 	 	my	 leg 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 suck 	 ed 	 	in	the	cold	mountain	air	,	i	could	feel	it	 burn 	 ing 	 	my	 lung 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	to	see	the	 s 	 un 	 	 shin 	 ing 	 	in	my	face	.
and	then	 every 	 thing 	 	went	black	.
where	was	i	?	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
my	body	was	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	pain	.
i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	hit	by	a	 speed 	 ing 	 	 util 	 ity 	 	truck	with	 on 	 ly 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	to	go	on	the	bike	ride	.
i	was	 air 	 lift 	 ed 	 	from	the	scene	of	the	accident	by	a	 rescu 	 e 	 	helicopter	to	a	large	 spin 	 al 	 	unit	in	sydney	.
i	had	 extens 	 ive 	 	and	life	-	 threaten 	 ing 	 	 inju 	 ries 	 	.
i	'd	broken	my	neck	and	my	back	in	six	 place 	 s 	 	.
i	broke	five	 rib 	 s 	 	on	my	left	side	.
i	broke	my	right	arm	.	i	broke	my	 collar 	 bone 	 	.
i	broke	some	 bone 	 s 	 	in	my	feet	.
my	whole	right	side	was	 rip 	 ped 	 	open	,	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 grave 	 l 	 	.
my	head	was	cut	open	 a 	 cross 	 	the	front	,	 lift 	 ed 	 	back	,	 ex 	 posing 	 	the	skull	 under 	 neath 	 	.
i	had	head	 inju 	 re 	 s 	 	.	i	had	internal	 inju 	 ries 	 	.
i	had	massive	blood	loss	.	in	fact	,	i	lost	about	five	 liter 	 s 	 	of	blood	,	which	is	all	 some 	 one 	 	my	 s 	 ize 	 	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	hold	.
by	the	time	the	helicopter	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	prince	henry	hospital	in	sydney	,	my	blood	pressure	was	40	over	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	day	.
for	over	10	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	 drift 	 ed 	 	between	two	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
i	had	an	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	my	body	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	out	of	my	body	,	 some 	 where 	 	else	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	from	above	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	 some 	 one 	 	else	.
why	would	i	want	to	go	back	to	a	body	that	was	so	broken	?
but	 th 	 is 	 	voice	 ke 	 pt 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	me	:	``	come	on	,	stay	with	me	.	``
``	no	.	it	's	too	hard	.	``
``	come	on	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	``
``	no	.	that	body	is	broken	.	it	can	no	 long 	 er 	 	serve	me	.	``
``	come	on	.	stay	with	me	.	we	can	do	it	.	we	can	do	it	together	.	``
i	was	at	a	 cross 	 road 	 s 	 	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	if	i	did	n't	return	to	my	body	,	i	'd	have	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
it	was	the	fight	of	my	life	.
after	10	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	made	the	decision	to	return	to	my	body	,	and	the	internal	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	.
the	next	concern	was	 whet 	 her 	 	i	would	walk	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 paralyze 	 d 	 	from	the	waist	down	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	to	my	 parent 	 s 	 	,	the	neck	break	was	a	 s 	 table 	 	fracture	,	but	the	back	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	.
the	vertebra	at	l	1	was	like	you	'd	 drop 	 ped 	 	a	peanut	,	 steppe 	 d 	 	on	it	,	 s 	 mash 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 piece 	 s 	 	.
they	'd	have	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	.
they	went	in	.	they	put	me	on	a	 bean 	 bag 	 	.	they	cut	me	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	cut	me	in	half	,	i	have	a	scar	that	 wrap 	 s 	 	around	my	entire	body	.
they	 pick 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	broken	bone	 a 	 s 	 	they	could	that	had	 lodg 	 ed 	 	in	my	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	.
they	took	out	two	of	my	broken	 rib 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 re 	 built 	 	my	back	,	l	1	,	they	 re 	 built 	 	it	,	they	took	out	 an 	 other 	 	broken	rib	,	they	fused	t	12	,	l	1	and	l	2	together	.
then	they	 stitch 	 ed 	 	me	up	.	they	took	an	entire	hour	to	stitch	me	up	.
i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	in	intensive	care	,	and	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	that	the	operation	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	success	 be 	 cause 	 	at	that	stage	i	had	a	little	bit	of	 move 	 ment 	 	in	one	of	my	big	 to 	 es 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	``	great	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	going	to	the	olympics	!	``
i	had	no	idea	.	that	's	the	sort	of	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 one 	 	else	,	not	me	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	.
but	then	the	doctor	came	over	to	me	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	janine	,	the	operation	was	a	success	,	and	we	've	 pick 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	bone	out	of	your	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	,	but	the	damage	is	permanent	.
the	central	nervous	system	 nerve 	 s 	 	,	there	is	no	cure	.
you	're	what	we	call	a	partial	paraplegic	,	and	you	'll	have	all	of	the	 inju 	 ries 	 	that	go	 a 	 long 	 	with	that	.
you	have	no	 feel 	 ing 	 	from	the	waist	down	,	and	at	most	,	you	might	get	10-	or	20	-	percent	return	.
you	'll	have	internal	 inju 	 ries 	 	for	the	rest	of	your	life	.
you	'll	have	to	use	a	catheter	for	the	rest	of	your	life	.
and	if	you	walk	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	will	be	with	 calip 	 ers 	 	and	a	 walk 	 ing 	 	frame	.	``
and	then	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	janine	,	you	'll	have	to	 re 	 think 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	you	do	in	your	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	never	going	to	be	able	to	do	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	did	before	.	``
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	grasp	what	she	was	 say 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	an	athlete	.	that	's	all	i	 k 	 new 	 	.	that	's	all	i	'd	 d 	 one 	 	.
if	i	could	n't	do	that	,	then	what	could	i	do	?
and	the	question	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	is	,	if	i	could	n't	do	that	,	then	who	was	i	?
they	 move 	 d 	 	me	from	intensive	care	to	 a 	 cute 	 	 spin 	 al 	 	.
i	was	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	a	thin	,	hard	 spin 	 al 	 	bed	.
i	had	no	 move 	 ment 	 	in	my	 leg 	 s 	 	.	i	had	tight	 stock 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	to	protect	from	blood	 clot 	 s 	 	.
i	had	one	arm	in	 plast 	 er 	 	,	one	arm	 ti 	 ed 	 	down	by	 drip 	 s 	 	.
i	had	a	neck	brace	and	 sand 	 bag 	 s 	 	on	either	side	of	my	head	and	i	saw	my	world	through	a	mirror	that	was	 suspend 	 ed 	 	above	my	head	.
i	 share 	 d 	 	the	ward	with	five	other	people	,	and	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 ly 	 ing 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	in	a	 spin 	 al 	 	ward	,	we	did	n't	know	what	each	other	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
how	 amaz 	 ing 	 	is	that	?	how	often	in	life	do	you	get	to	make	 friend 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	judgment	-	free	,	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	based	on	spirit	?
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 super 	 ficial 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	 share 	 d 	 	our	 inner 	 most 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	,	our	 fear 	 s 	 	,	and	our	 hope 	 s 	 	for	life	after	the	 spin 	 al 	 	ward	.
i	remember	one	night	,	one	of	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	came	in	,	jonathan	,	with	a	whole	lot	of	plastic	 straw 	 s 	 	.
he	put	a	pile	on	top	of	each	of	us	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	start	 th 	 read 	 ing 	 	them	together	.	``
well	,	there	was	n't	much	else	to	do	in	the	 spin 	 al 	 	ward	,	so	we	did	.
and	when	we	'd	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	he	went	around	 silent 	 ly 	 	and	he	 join 	 ed 	 	all	of	the	 straw 	 s 	 	up	till	it	 loop 	 ed 	 	around	the	whole	ward	,	and	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	,	hold	on	to	your	 straw 	 s 	 	.	``
and	we	did	.	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	right	.	now	we	're	all	 connect 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	held	on	,	and	we	 breath 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	,	we	 k 	 new 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	on	 th 	 is 	 	journey	 al 	 one 	 	.
and	even	 ly 	 ing 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	in	the	 spin 	 al 	 	ward	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 credible 	 	depth	and	 rich 	 ness 	 	,	of	 authentic 	 ity 	 	and	 connect 	 ion 	 	that	i	had	never	 experience 	 d 	 	before	.
and	each	of	us	 k 	 new 	 	that	when	we	left	the	 spin 	 al 	 	ward	we	would	never	be	the	same	.
after	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	it	was	time	to	go	home	.
i	remember	dad	 push 	 ing 	 	me	 out 	 side 	 	in	my	wheelchair	,	 wrap 	 ped 	 	in	a	 plast 	 er 	 	body	cast	,	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	on	my	face	for	the	first	time	.
i	 soak 	 ed 	 	it	up	and	i	thought	,	how	could	i	ever	have	taken	 th 	 is 	 	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	?
i	felt	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	my	life	.
but	before	i	left	the	hospital	,	the	head	nurse	had	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	janine	,	i	want	you	to	be	ready	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	get	home	,	 some 	 thing 	 	's	going	to	happen	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	?	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	're	going	to	get	 depress 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	not	me	,	not	janine	the	machine	,	``	which	was	my	 nick 	 name 	 	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	are	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	see	,	it	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	.
in	the	 spin 	 al 	 	ward	,	that	's	normal	.
you	're	in	a	wheelchair	.	that	's	normal	.
but	you	're	going	to	get	home	and	 real 	 ize 	 	how	different	life	is	.	``
and	i	got	home	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	sister	sam	was	right	.
i	did	get	 depress 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	in	my	wheelchair	.	i	had	no	 feel 	 ing 	 	from	the	waist	down	,	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	a	catheter	bottle	.	i	could	n't	walk	.
i	'd	lost	so	much	weight	in	the	hospital	i	now	 weigh 	 ed 	 	about	80	 pound 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	up	.
all	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	put	my	running	 shoe 	 s 	 	on	and	run	out	the	door	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	my	old	life	back	.	i	 want 	 ed 	 	my	body	back	.
and	i	can	remember	mom	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	end	of	my	bed	,	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	wonder	if	life	will	ever	be	good	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
and	i	thought	,	``	how	could	it	?	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	lost	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	 valu 	 ed 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	'd	 work 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
gone	.	``
and	the	question	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	was	,	``	why	me	?	why	me	?	``
and	then	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	my	 friend 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	still	in	the	 spin 	 al 	 	ward	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	maria	.
maria	was	in	a	car	accident	,	and	she	 wok 	 e 	 	up	on	her	16th	 birth 	 day 	 	to	the	news	that	she	was	a	complete	 quad 	 rip 	 leg 	 ic 	 	,	had	no	 move 	 ment 	 	from	the	neck	down	,	had	damage	to	her	vocal	 chor 	 d 	 s 	 	,	and	she	could	n't	talk	.
they	told	me	,	``	we	're	going	to	move	you	next	to	her	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	it	will	be	good	for	her	.	``
i	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	.	i	did	n't	know	how	i	'd	react	to	 be 	 ing 	 	next	to	her	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	it	would	be	 challeng 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 bless 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	maria	 al 	 ways 	 	 smil 	 ed 	 	.
she	was	 al 	 ways 	 	happy	,	and	even	when	she	 beg 	 an 	 	to	talk	 aga 	 in 	 	,	albeit	difficult	to	understand	,	she	never	 complain 	 ed 	 	,	not	once	.
and	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	how	had	she	ever	found	that	level	of	 accept 	 ance 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	just	my	life	.
it	was	life	 it 	 self 	 	.	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	just	my	pain	.
it	was	 every 	 body 	 	's	pain	.	and	then	i	 k 	 new 	 	,	just	like	before	,	that	i	had	a	choice	.	i	could	keep	 fight 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	or	i	could	let	go	and	accept	not	 on 	 ly 	 	my	body	but	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	of	my	life	.
and	then	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	me	?	``
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	ask	,	``	why	not	me	?	``
and	then	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	at	rock	bottom	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	perfect	place	to	start	.
i	had	never	before	thought	of	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	creative	person	.
i	was	an	athlete	.	my	body	was	a	machine	.
but	now	i	was	about	to	embark	on	the	most	creative	project	that	any	of	us	could	ever	do	:	that	of	 re 	 building 	 	a	life	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	had	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	idea	what	i	was	going	to	do	,	in	that	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	came	a	sense	of	 free 	 dom 	 	.
i	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	a	set	path	.
i	was	free	to	explore	life	's	infinite	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
and	that	 real 	 ization 	 	was	about	to	change	my	life	.
 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	home	in	my	wheelchair	and	my	 plast 	 er 	 	body	cast	,	an	 air 	 plane 	 	flew	 over 	 head 	 	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	,	and	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	that	's	it	!
if	i	ca	n't	walk	,	then	i	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	fly	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mom	,	i	'm	going	to	learn	how	to	fly	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	nice	,	dear	.	``

i	made	a	 book 	 ing 	 	,	and	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	my	friend	chris	and	my	mom	drove	me	out	to	the	 air 	 port 	 	,	all	80	 pound 	 s 	 	of	me	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	a	 plast 	 er 	 	body	cast	in	a	 bag 	 gy 	 	pair	of	 over 	 all 	 s 	 	.
i	can	tell	you	,	i	did	not	look	like	the	ideal	 candid 	 ate 	 	to	get	a	pilot	's	 licens 	 e 	 	.
i	'm	 hold 	 ing 	 	on	to	the	counter	 be 	 cause 	 	i	ca	n't	stand	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	hi	,	i	'm	here	for	a	 fly 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 	.	``
and	they	took	one	look	and	ran	out	the	back	to	draw	short	 straw 	 s 	 	.
``	you	get	her	.	``	``	no	,	no	,	you	take	her	.	``

i	go	,	``	great	.	``	and	so	they	drive	me	down	,	they	get	me	out	on	the	 tar 	 mac 	 	,	and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	red	,	white	and	blue	 air 	 plane 	 	.
it	was	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.	they	 lift 	 ed 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cock 	 pit 	 	.

that	's	when	you	use	your	feet	to	control	the	 rud 	 der 	 	 ped 	 al 	 s 	 	to	control	the	 air 	 plane 	 	on	the	ground	.

so	he	got	over	to	the	 run 	 way 	 	,	and	he	 appli 	 ed 	 	the	power	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	took	off	down	the	 run 	 way 	 	,	and	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	 lift 	 ed 	 	up	off	the	 tar 	 mac 	 	,	and	we	 be 	 came 	 	 air 	 borne 	 	,	i	had	the	most	 in 	 credible 	 	sense	of	 free 	 dom 	 	.
and	andrew	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	got	over	the	training	area	,	``	you	see	that	mountain	over	there	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	take	the	 control 	 s 	 	,	and	you	fly	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	that	mountain	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	he	was	 point 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	blue	 mountain 	 s 	 	where	the	journey	had	 beg 	 un 	 	.
and	i	took	the	 control 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	was	a	long	,	long	way	from	that	 spin 	 al 	 	ward	,	and	i	 k 	 new 	 	right	then	that	i	was	going	to	be	a	pilot	.
did	n't	know	how	on	earth	i	'd	ever	pass	a	medical	.
but	i	'd	worry	about	that	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	right	now	i	had	a	dream	.
so	i	went	home	,	i	got	a	training	 di 	 ary 	 	out	,	and	i	had	a	plan	.
and	i	 practice 	 d 	 	my	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	,	and	i	went	from	the	point	of	two	people	 hold 	 ing 	 	me	up	to	one	person	 hold 	 ing 	 	me	up	to	the	point	where	i	could	walk	around	the	furniture	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	n't	too	far	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	then	i	made	great	 progress 	 ion 	 	to	the	point	where	i	could	walk	around	the	house	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	onto	the	 wall 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	mom	 s 	 aid 	 	she	was	 fore 	 ver 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	me	,	 wi 	 ping 	 	off	my	 finger 	 print 	 s 	 	.
but	at	 l 	 east 	 	she	 al 	 ways 	 	 k 	 new 	 	where	i	was	.
so	while	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	and	put	my	body	back	together	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	went	on	with	my	 theor 	 y 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	then	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	and	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	i	 pass 	 ed 	 	my	pilot	's	medical	,	and	that	was	my	green	light	to	fly	.
and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	every	moment	i	could	out	at	that	 fly 	 ing 	 	school	,	way	out	of	my	comfort	zone	,	all	these	young	 guy 	 s 	 	that	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	qantas	 pilot 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	and	little	old	hop	-	 a 	 long 	 	me	in	first	my	 plast 	 er 	 	cast	,	and	then	my	steel	brace	,	my	 bag 	 gy 	 	 over 	 all 	 s 	 	,	my	bag	of	 medic 	 ation 	 	and	 catheter 	 s 	 	and	my	 l 	 imp 	 	,	and	they	used	to	look	at	me	and	think	,	``	oh	,	who	is	she	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	?	she	's	never	going	to	be	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	thought	that	too	.
but	that	did	n't	matter	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	that	 burn 	 ed 	 	that	far	 outweigh 	 ed 	 	my	 inju 	 ries 	 	.
and	little	 goal 	 s 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	going	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	i	got	my	private	pilot	's	 licens 	 e 	 	,	and	then	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	 navig 	 ate 	 	,	and	i	flew	my	 friend 	 s 	 	around	australia	.
and	then	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	fly	an	 air 	 plane 	 	with	two	 engine 	 s 	 	and	i	got	my	 t 	 win 	 	engine	rating	.
and	then	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	fly	in	bad	weather	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	fine	weather	and	got	my	instrument	rating	.
and	then	i	got	my	commercial	pilot	's	 licens 	 e 	 	.
and	then	i	got	my	 instruct 	 or 	 	rating	.
and	then	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	back	at	that	same	school	where	i	'd	gone	for	that	 ver 	 y 	 	first	flight	,	 teach 	 ing 	 	other	people	how	to	fly	,	just	under	18	 month 	 s 	 	after	i	'd	left	the	 spin 	 al 	 	ward	.
and	then	i	thought	,	``	why	stop	there	?
why	not	learn	to	fly	 up 	 side 	 	down	?	``
and	i	did	,	and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	fly	 up 	 side 	 	down	and	 be 	 came 	 	an	 aerobatic 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 instruct 	 or 	 	.
and	mom	and	dad	?	never	 be 	 en 	 	up	.
but	then	i	 k 	 new 	 	for	certain	that	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	my	body	might	be	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	my	spirit	that	was	 un 	 stop 	 p 	 able 	 	.
the	 philosoph 	 er 	 	lao	tzu	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	when	you	let	go	of	what	you	are	,	you	 be 	 come 	 	what	you	might	be	.	``
i	now	know	that	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	i	let	go	of	who	i	thought	i	was	that	i	was	able	to	create	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	life	.
it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	i	let	go	of	the	life	i	thought	i	should	have	that	i	was	able	to	embrace	the	life	that	was	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	me	.
i	now	know	that	my	real	strength	never	came	from	my	body	,	and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	my	physical	 cap 	 abilities 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	,	who	i	am	is	 un 	 change 	 d 	 	.
the	pilot	light	 in 	 side 	 	of	me	was	still	a	light	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	in	each	and	every	one	of	us	.
i	know	that	i	'm	not	my	body	,	and	i	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	you	're	not	 your 	 s 	 	.
and	then	it	no	 long 	 er 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	what	you	look	like	,	where	you	come	from	,	or	what	you	do	for	a	living	.
all	that	 matter 	 s 	 	is	that	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	fan	the	flame	of	 human 	 ity 	 	by	living	our	 live 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	ultimate	creative	 express 	 ion 	 	of	who	we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	all	 connect 	 ed 	 	by	 million 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	 straw 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	time	to	join	 t 	 hose 	 	up	and	to	hang	on	.
and	if	we	are	to	move	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 bli 	 s 	 s 	 	,	it	's	time	we	shed	our	focus	on	the	physical	and	 in 	 stead 	 	embrace	the	 virtue 	 s 	 	of	the	heart	.
so	raise	your	 straw 	 s 	 	if	you	'll	join	me	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
