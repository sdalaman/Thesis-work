so	i	grew	up	in	limpopo	,	on	the	border	of	limpopo	and	mpumalanga	,	a	little	town	 call 	 ed 	 	motetema	.
water	and	 electric 	 ity 	 	supply	are	 a 	 s 	 	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	weather	,	and	growing	up	in	these	tough	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	at	the	age	of	17	,	i	was	 relax 	 ing 	 	with	a	couple	of	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	in	winter	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 un 	 bath 	 ing 	 	.
the	limpopo	 s 	 un 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	hot	in	winter	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 un 	 bath 	 ing 	 	,	my	best	friend	next	to	me	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	man	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 some 	 body 	 	invent	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	can	just	put	on	your	skin	and	then	you	do	n't	have	to	 bath 	 e 	 	?	``
and	i	 s 	 at 	 	,	and	i	was	like	,	``	man	,	i	would	buy	that	,	eh	?	``
so	i	went	home	,	and	i	did	a	little	research	,	and	i	found	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 shock 	 ing 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
over	2.5	billion	people	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	do	not	have	proper	access	to	water	and	 sanit 	 ation 	 	.
four	hundred	and	fifty	million	of	them	are	in	africa	,	and	five	million	of	them	are	in	south	africa	.
 vari 	 ous 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	 thriv 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	environment	,	the	most	drastic	of	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 tra 	 choma 	 	.
 tra 	 choma 	 	is	an	 infect 	 ion 	 	of	the	eye	due	to	dirt	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	eye	.	 multi 	 ple 	 	 infect 	 ions 	 	of	 tra 	 choma 	 	can	 leav 	 e 	 	you	 permanent 	 ly 	 	blind	.
the	disease	 leav 	 es 	 	eight	million	people	 permanent 	 ly 	 	blind	each	and	every	year	.	the	 shock 	 ing 	 	part	about	it	is	that	to	avoid	 be 	 ing 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	 tra 	 choma 	 	,	all	you	have	to	do	is	wash	your	face	:	no	medicine	,	no	 pill 	 s 	 	,	no	 inject 	 ions 	 	.
so	after	 see 	 ing 	 	these	 shock 	 ing 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	even	if	i	'm	not	just	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	 my 	 self 	 	and	the	fact	that	i	do	n't	want	to	 bath 	 e 	 	,	i	at	 l 	 east 	 	need	to	do	it	to	try	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.	``
so	with	my	 trust 	 y 	 	little	 s 	 te 	 ed 	 	,	my	nokia	6234	cell	phone	--	i	did	n't	have	a	 lap 	 top 	 	,	i	did	n't	have	 inter 	 net 	 	much	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	20	-	rand	-	an	-	hour	 inter 	 net 	 	cafe	--	i	did	research	on	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	on	google	,	about	 lot 	 ions 	 	,	 cream 	 s 	 	,	the	 com 	 position 	 s 	 	,	the	 melt 	 ing 	 	 point 	 s 	 	,	the	 toxic 	 ities 	 	--	i	did	high	school	science	--	and	i	wrote	down	a	little	formula	on	a	piece	of	paper	,	and	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	the	kfc	special	spice	,	you	know	?
so	i	was	like	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	we	've	got	the	formula	ready	.
now	we	need	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 in 	 to 	 	practice	.
fast	forward	four	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	after	 hav 	 ing 	 	written	a	40	-	page	business	plan	on	the	cell	phone	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	written	my	patent	on	the	cell	phone	,	i	'm	the	 young 	 est 	 	patent	-	holder	in	the	country	,	and	--	--	i	ca	n't	say	any	more	than	that	.
i	had	 invent 	 ed 	 	drybath	,	the	world	's	first	bath	-	 substitut 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 ion 	 	.
you	 liter 	 ally 	 	put	it	on	your	skin	,	and	you	do	n't	have	to	 bath 	 e 	 	.
so	after	 hav 	 ing 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	it	work	in	high	school	with	the	 limit 	 ed 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	i	had	,	i	went	to	university	,	met	a	few	people	,	got	it	 in 	 to 	 	practice	,	and	we	have	a	fully	 function 	 ing 	 	product	that	's	ready	to	go	to	the	market	.	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	on	the	market	.
so	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	few	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	in	 commercial 	 izing 	 	and	making	drybath	 avail 	 able 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	poor	 commun 	 ities 	 	do	n't	buy	 product 	 s 	 	in	bulk	.
they	buy	 product 	 s 	 	on	demand	.	a	person	in	alex	 do 	 es 	 	n't	buy	a	box	of	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	.	they	buy	one	 cigar 	 ette 	 	each	day	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	more	expensive	.
so	we	 package 	 d 	 	drybath	in	these	 innov 	 ative 	 	little	 sachet 	 s 	 	.
you	just	snap	them	in	half	,	and	you	 squeez 	 e 	 	it	out	.
and	the	cool	part	is	,	one	sachet	 substitut 	 es 	 	one	bath	for	five	rand	.
after	creating	that	model	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 implement 	 ing 	 	the	product	.
we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	even	rich	 kid 	 s 	 	from	the	 suburb 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	want	drybath	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	once	a	week	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	could	 s 	 ave 	 	80	million	 liter 	 s 	 	of	water	on	average	each	time	they	 skip 	 ped 	 	a	bath	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	we	would	 s 	 ave 	 	two	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	for	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	two	 hour 	 s 	 	more	for	school	,	two	 hour 	 s 	 	more	for	 home 	 work 	 	,	two	 hour 	 s 	 	more	to	just	be	a	kid	.
after	 see 	 ing 	 	that	global	impact	,	we	 narrow 	 ed 	 	it	down	to	our	key	value	 pro 	 position 	 	,	which	was	 clean 	 lines 	 s 	 	and	convenience	.
drybath	is	a	rich	man	's	convenience	and	a	poor	man	's	 life 	 saver 	 	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	put	the	product	 in 	 to 	 	practice	,	we	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	now	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	selling	the	product	onto	a	 multi 	 national 	 	to	take	it	to	the	 re 	 tail 	 	market	,	and	one	question	i	have	for	the	audience	 to 	 day 	 	is	,	on	the	 grave 	 l 	 	 road 	 s 	 	of	limpopo	,	with	an	 allow 	 ance 	 	of	50	rand	a	week	,	i	came	up	with	a	way	for	the	world	not	to	 bath 	 e 	 	.
what	's	 stop 	 ping 	 	you	?
i	'm	not	 d 	 one 	 	yet	.	i	'm	not	 d 	 one 	 	yet	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	key	thing	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	 through 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	process	,	last	year	google	named	me	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	the	 bright 	 est 	 	young	 mind 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	the	best	student	entrepreneur	in	the	world	,	the	first	african	to	get	that	accolade	,	and	one	thing	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	me	is	,	i	did	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	just	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	want	to	 bath 	 e 	 	.	thank	you	.
