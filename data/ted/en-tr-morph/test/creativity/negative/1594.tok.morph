once	 up 	 on 	 	a	time	,	the	world	was	a	big	,	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	family	.
it	was	run	by	the	great	and	 power 	 ful 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	the	people	 we 	 re 	 	 help 	 less 	 	and	 hope 	 less 	 	 naught 	 y 	 	children	.
if	any	of	the	more	 row 	 di 	 er 	 	children	 question 	 ed 	 	the	 author 	 ity 	 	of	the	 parent 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 cold 	 ed 	 	.
if	they	went	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 parent 	 s 	 	'	rooms	,	or	even	 in 	 to 	 	the	secret	filing	 cabinet 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 punish 	 ed 	 	,	and	told	that	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	good	they	must	never	go	in	there	 aga 	 in 	 	.
then	one	day	,	a	man	came	to	town	with	boxes	and	boxes	of	secret	 document 	 s 	 	 stole 	 n 	 	from	the	 parent 	 s 	 	'	rooms	.
``	look	what	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hid 	 ing 	 	from	you	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
the	children	 look 	 ed 	 	and	 we 	 re 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 map 	 s 	 	and	 minute 	 s 	 	from	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	where	the	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 slagg 	 ing 	 	each	other	off	.
they	 behav 	 ed 	 	just	like	the	children	.
and	they	made	 mistak 	 es 	 	,	too	,	just	like	the	children	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	was	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	secret	filing	 cabinet 	 s 	 	.
well	,	there	was	a	girl	in	the	town	,	and	she	did	n't	think	they	should	be	in	the	secret	filing	 cabinet 	 s 	 	,	or	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	there	ought	to	be	a	law	to	allow	the	children	access	.
and	so	she	set	about	to	make	it	so	.
well	,	i	'm	the	girl	in	that	story	,	and	the	secret	 document 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 we 	 re 	 	 locate 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	the	british	parliament	,	and	the	data	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	my	 hand 	 s 	 	on	 we 	 re 	 	the	expense	 receipt 	 s 	 	of	 member 	 s 	 	of	parliament	.
i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	question	to	ask	in	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
it	was	n't	like	i	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	the	code	to	a	nuclear	 bunk 	 er 	 	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	but	the	amount	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	i	got	from	 th 	 is 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	of	information	request	,	you	would	have	thought	i	'd	 ask 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	i	 f 	 ought 	 	for	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	it	was	one	of	 man 	 y 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 request 	 s 	 	that	i	made	,	not	--	i	did	n't	--	 he 	 y 	 	,	look	,	i	did	n't	set	out	,	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	to	 revolution 	 ize 	 	the	british	parliament	.
that	was	not	my	 intent 	 ion 	 	.	i	was	just	making	these	 request 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	research	for	my	first	book	.
but	it	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	long	,	 pro 	 tract 	 ed 	 	legal	battle	and	there	i	was	after	five	 year 	 s 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	against	parliament	in	front	of	three	of	britain	's	most	eminent	high	court	 judg 	 es 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 rul 	 ing 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	parliament	had	to	 re 	 lease 	 	 th 	 is 	 	data	.
and	i	've	got	to	tell	you	,	i	was	n't	that	 hope 	 ful 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'd	 s 	 een 	 	the	 establish 	 ment 	 	.	i	thought	,	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	together	.	i	am	out	of	luck	.
well	,	guess	what	?	i	won	.	hooray	.
well	,	that	's	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	problem	was	that	parliament	 delay 	 ed 	 	and	 delay 	 ed 	 	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	that	data	,	and	then	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 retrospect 	 ively 	 	change	the	law	so	that	it	would	no	 long 	 er 	 	 app 	 ly 	 	to	them	.
the	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	law	they	'd	 pass 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	that	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	 every 	 body 	 	else	,	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	keep	it	so	it	did	n't	 app 	 ly 	 	to	them	.
what	they	had	n't	 count 	 ed 	 	on	was	 digit 	 ization 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	 me 	 ant 	 	that	all	 t 	 hose 	 	paper	 receipt 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	in	 electron 	 ically 	 	,	and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	for	 some 	 body 	 	to	just	copy	that	entire	 data 	 base 	 	,	put	it	on	a	 dis 	 k 	 	,	and	then	just	saunter	 out 	 side 	 	of	parliament	,	which	they	did	,	and	then	they	shopped	that	 dis 	 k 	 	to	the	highest	bidder	,	which	was	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	 tele 	 graph 	 	,	and	then	,	you	all	remember	,	there	was	 week 	 s 	 	and	 week 	 s 	 	of	 revel 	 ations 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	from	porn	 movie 	 s 	 	and	bath	 plug 	 s 	 	and	new	 kitchen 	 s 	 	and	 mortgage 	 s 	 	that	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	paid	off	.
the	end	result	was	six	 mini 	 sters 	 	 re 	 sign 	 ed 	 	,	the	first	speaker	of	the	house	in	300	 year 	 s 	 	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	 re 	 sign 	 	,	a	new	government	was	 elect 	 ed 	 	on	a	 man 	 date 	 	of	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	120	mps	 steppe 	 d 	 	down	at	that	election	,	and	so	far	,	four	mps	and	two	 lord 	 s 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	jail	time	for	fraud	.
so	,	thank	you	.
well	,	i	tell	you	that	story	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	n't	 un 	 ique 	 	to	britain	.
it	was	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	culture	 c 	 lash 	 	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	world	between	 bewigg 	 ed 	 	and	 be 	 stock 	 ing 	 ed 	 	 official 	 s 	 	who	think	that	they	can	rule	over	us	 with 	 out 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 pry 	 ing 	 	from	the	public	,	and	then	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 confront 	 ed 	 	with	a	public	who	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	content	with	that	 arrange 	 ment 	 	,	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	not	content	with	it	,	now	,	more	often	,	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	official	data	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	we	are	moving	to	 th 	 is 	 	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	information	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	.
 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	 ad 	 mission 	 	:	even	when	i	was	a	kid	,	i	used	to	have	these	little	 s 	 py 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	i	would	,	like	,	see	what	 every 	 body 	 	was	 do 	 ing 	 	in	my	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	and	log	it	down	.
i	think	that	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 indic 	 ation 	 	about	my	future	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	journalist	,	and	what	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	access	to	information	field	for	so	long	is	that	it	used	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	a	niche	interest	,	and	it	's	gone	 main 	 stream 	 	.	 every 	 body 	 	,	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	around	the	world	,	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	about	what	people	in	power	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
they	want	a	say	in	 decision 	 s 	 	that	are	made	in	 the 	 ir 	 	name	and	with	 the 	 ir 	 	money	.	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	information	that	i	think	is	an	information	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	same	 principle 	 s 	 	of	the	first	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
it	's	about	 search 	 ing 	 	for	the	truth	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	true	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	i	say	so	.	``
no	,	it	's	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	truth	based	on	what	you	can	see	and	what	can	be	tested	.
that	,	in	the	first	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	,	led	to	 question 	 s 	 	about	the	right	of	 king 	 s 	 	,	the	divine	right	of	 king 	 s 	 	to	rule	over	people	,	or	that	women	should	be	subordinate	to	men	,	or	that	the	church	was	the	official	word	of	god	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	church	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	suppress	it	,	but	what	they	had	n't	 count 	 ed 	 	on	was	technology	,	and	then	they	had	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	which	 sudden 	 ly 	 	enabled	these	 idea 	 s 	 	to	spread	 cheap 	 ly 	 	,	far	and	fast	,	and	people	would	come	together	in	coffee	 house 	 s 	 	,	discuss	the	 idea 	 s 	 	,	plot	revolution	.
in	our	day	,	we	have	 digit 	 ization 	 	.	that	 strip 	 s 	 	all	the	physical	mass	out	of	information	,	so	now	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	zero	cost	to	copy	and	share	information	.
our	 print 	 ing 	 	press	is	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.	our	coffee	 house 	 s 	 	are	social	 network 	 s 	 	.
we	're	moving	to	what	i	would	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	a	fully	 connect 	 ed 	 	system	,	and	we	have	global	 decision 	 s 	 	to	make	in	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	 decision 	 s 	 	about	climate	,	about	finance	 system 	 s 	 	,	about	 resource 	 s 	 	.	and	think	about	it	--	if	we	want	to	make	an	 import 	 ant 	 	decision	about	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	house	,	we	do	n't	just	go	off	.	i	mean	,	i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	i	want	to	see	a	lot	of	 house 	 s 	 	before	i	put	that	much	money	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	if	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	a	finance	system	,	we	need	a	lot	of	information	to	take	in	.	it	's	just	not	possible	for	one	person	to	take	in	the	amount	,	the	volume	of	information	,	and	 analyz 	 e 	 	it	to	make	good	 decision 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	why	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	demand	for	access	to	information	.
that	's	why	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	more	 dis 	 closure 	 	 law 	 s 	 	come	out	,	so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	on	the	environment	,	there	's	the	aarhus	convention	,	which	is	a	european	 direct 	 ive 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	people	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	right	to	know	,	so	if	your	water	company	is	 dump 	 ing 	 	water	 in 	 to 	 	your	river	,	 sew 	 age 	 	water	 in 	 to 	 	your	river	,	you	have	a	right	to	know	about	it	.
in	the	finance	industry	,	you	now	have	more	of	a	right	to	know	about	what	's	going	on	,	so	we	have	different	anti	-	 bribe 	 ry 	 	 law 	 s 	 	,	money	 regulat 	 ions 	 	,	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	corporate	 dis 	 closure 	 	,	so	you	can	now	track	 asset 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 border 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	to	hide	 asset 	 s 	 	,	tax	 avoid 	 ance 	 	,	pay	 ine 	 quality 	 	.	so	that	's	great	.	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	find	out	more	and	more	about	these	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	all	moving	to	 th 	 is 	 	central	system	,	 th 	 is 	 	fully	 connect 	 ed 	 	system	,	all	of	them	 ex 	 cept 	 	one	.	can	you	guess	which	one	?
it	's	the	system	which	 under 	 pin 	 s 	 	all	these	other	 system 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	system	by	which	we	organize	and	 exercis 	 e 	 	power	,	and	there	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	 politic 	 s 	 	,	we	're	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	 th 	 is 	 	top	-	down	 hierarch 	 y 	 	.
and	how	is	it	possible	that	the	volume	of	information	can	be	 process 	 ed 	 	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	in	 th 	 is 	 	system	?
well	,	it	just	ca	n't	.	that	's	it	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 large 	 ly 	 	what	's	 be 	 hind 	 	the	crisis	of	 leg 	 i 	 timacy 	 	in	our	different	 government 	 s 	 	right	now	.
so	i	've	told	you	a	bit	about	what	i	did	to	try	and	drag	parliament	,	 kick 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	21st	century	,	and	i	'm	just	going	to	give	you	a	couple	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	what	a	few	other	people	i	know	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	seb	 ba 	 con 	 	.	he	's	a	computer	 programm 	 er 	 	,	and	he	built	a	 s 	 ite 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	alaveteli	,	and	what	it	is	,	it	's	a	 free 	 dom 	 	of	information	platform	.
it	's	open	-	source	,	with	 document 	 ation 	 	,	and	it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	make	a	 free 	 dom 	 	of	information	request	,	to	ask	your	public	body	a	question	,	so	it	 take 	 s 	 	all	the	hassle	out	of	it	,	and	i	can	tell	you	that	there	is	a	lot	of	hassle	making	these	 request 	 s 	 	,	so	it	 take 	 s 	 	all	of	that	hassle	out	,	and	you	just	type	in	your	question	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	police	 officer 	 s 	 	have	a	criminal	record	?
it	 zoom 	 s 	 	it	off	to	the	appropriate	person	,	it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	when	the	time	limit	is	coming	to	an	end	,	it	 keep 	 s 	 	track	of	all	the	 correspond 	 ence 	 	,	it	 post 	 s 	 	it	up	there	,	and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	 archiv 	 e 	 	of	public	knowledge	.
so	that	's	open	-	source	and	it	can	be	used	in	any	country	where	there	is	some	kind	of	 free 	 dom 	 	of	information	law	.
so	there	's	a	list	there	of	the	different	 count 	 ries 	 	that	have	it	,	and	then	there	's	a	few	more	coming	on	board	.
so	if	any	of	you	out	there	like	the	sound	of	that	and	have	a	law	like	that	in	your	country	,	i	know	that	seb	would	love	to	hear	from	you	about	 collabor 	 ating 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	that	 in 	 to 	 	your	country	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	birgitta	jónsdóttir	.	she	's	an	icelandic	mp	.
and	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 un 	 usual 	 	mp	.	in	iceland	,	she	was	one	of	the	 protest 	 ers 	 	who	was	 out 	 side 	 	of	parliament	when	the	country	's	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	,	and	then	she	was	 elect 	 ed 	 	on	a	reform	 man 	 date 	 	,	and	she	's	now	 spear 	 head 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
it	's	the	icelandic	modern	media	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	and	they	've	just	got	 fund 	 ing 	 	to	make	it	an	 inter 	 national 	 	modern	media	project	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	taking	all	of	the	best	 law 	 s 	 	around	the	world	about	 free 	 dom 	 	of	 express 	 ion 	 	,	 protect 	 ion 	 	of	 whistl 	 e 	 blow 	 ers 	 	,	 protect 	 ion 	 	from	 lib 	 el 	 	,	source	 protect 	 ion 	 	,	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	iceland	a	 publish 	 ing 	 	 have 	 n 	 	.
it	's	a	place	where	your	data	can	be	free	,	so	when	we	think	about	,	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	how	 government 	 s 	 	want	to	access	user	data	,	what	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	in	iceland	is	make	 th 	 is 	 	safe	 have 	 n 	 	where	it	can	happen	.
in	my	own	field	of	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	 journal 	 ism 	 	,	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 ite 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	 dash 	 board 	 	.	and	if	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	track	a	dictator	's	 asset 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	hosni	mubarak	,	you	know	,	he	's	just	 funnel 	 ing 	 	out	cash	from	his	country	when	he	 know 	 s 	 	he	's	in	trouble	,	and	what	you	want	to	do	to	investigate	that	is	,	you	need	to	have	access	to	all	of	the	world	's	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	,	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	'	house	 registr 	 ations 	 	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	tries	to	 agglome 	 rate 	 	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	place	so	you	can	start	 search 	 ing 	 	for	,	you	know	,	his	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	his	 friend 	 s 	 	,	the	head	of	his	security	 service 	 s 	 	.
you	can	try	and	find	out	how	he	's	moving	out	 asset 	 s 	 	from	that	country	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	 decision 	 s 	 	which	are	 impact 	 ing 	 	us	the	most	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	made	about	war	and	so	forth	,	 aga 	 in 	 	we	ca	n't	just	make	a	 free 	 dom 	 	of	information	request	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	.	so	we	're	still	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 il 	 legitimate 	 	ways	of	 get 	 ting 	 	information	,	through	 leak 	 s 	 	.
so	when	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	did	 th 	 is 	 	investigation	about	the	afghan	war	,	you	know	,	they	ca	n't	walk	 in 	 to 	 	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	defense	and	ask	for	all	the	information	.
you	know	,	they	're	just	not	going	to	get	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	came	from	 leak 	 s 	 	of	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 dis 	 patch 	 es 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	written	by	american	 soldier 	 s 	 	about	the	afghan	war	,	and	 leak 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	they	're	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	investigation	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	large	investigation	is	around	world	 diploma 	 cy 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	based	around	 leak 	 s 	 	,	251,000	u.s.	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	 cable 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	investigation	 be 	 cause 	 	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	leak	through	a	leak	from	a	 dis 	 grunt 	 led 	 	wikileaker	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	going	to	work	at	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	.
so	i	can	tell	you	 first 	 hand 	 	what	it	was	like	to	have	access	to	 th 	 is 	 	leak	.	it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	i	mean	,	it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
it	 re 	 minded 	 	me	of	that	scene	in	``	the	wizard	of	oz.	``
do	you	know	the	one	i	mean	?	where	the	little	dog	toto	 run 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	to	where	the	wizard	[	is	]	,	and	he	 pull 	 s 	 	back	,	the	dog	's	 pull 	 ing 	 	back	the	 cur 	 tain 	 	,	and	--	``	do	n't	look	 be 	 hind 	 	the	screen	.	do	n't	look	at	the	man	 be 	 hind 	 	the	screen	.	``
it	was	just	like	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	 start 	 ed 	 	to	see	is	that	all	of	these	grand	 state 	 s 	 men 	 	,	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 pomp 	 ous 	 	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	just	like	us	.
they	all	 bitch 	 ed 	 	about	each	other	.	i	mean	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 gossip 	 y 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 cable 	 s 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	but	i	thought	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	point	for	all	of	us	to	grasp	,	these	are	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	just	like	us	.	they	do	n't	have	special	 power 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	magic	.	they	are	not	our	 parent 	 s 	 	.
beyond	that	,	what	i	found	most	 fasci 	 nating 	 	was	the	level	of	 en 	 demic 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	that	i	saw	 a 	 cross 	 	all	different	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 center 	 ed 	 	around	the	heart	of	power	,	around	public	 official 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 emb 	 ez 	 zl 	 ing 	 	the	public	's	money	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	personal	 enrich 	 ment 	 	,	and	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	do	that	 be 	 cause 	 	of	official	secrecy	.
so	i	've	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	wikileaks	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	what	could	be	more	open	than	 publish 	 ing 	 	all	the	material	?
 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	what	julian	assange	did	.
he	was	n't	content	with	the	way	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	it	to	be	safe	and	legal	.	he	threw	it	all	out	there	.
that	did	end	up	with	 vulner 	 able 	 	people	in	afghanistan	 be 	 ing 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	.	it	 al 	 so 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	that	the	belarussian	dictator	was	 give 	 n 	 	a	 hand 	 y 	 	list	of	all	the	pro	-	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 campaign 	 ers 	 	in	that	country	who	had	spoken	to	the	u.s.	government	.
is	that	radical	 open 	 ness 	 	?	i	say	it	's	not	,	 be 	 cause 	 	for	me	,	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	 abdic 	 ating 	 	power	,	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	 account 	 ability 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	partner	with	power	.	it	's	about	sharing	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	sharing	 account 	 ability 	 	.	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	fact	that	he	 threaten 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 ue 	 	me	 be 	 cause 	 	i	got	a	leak	of	his	 leak 	 s 	 	,	i	thought	that	 show 	 ed 	 	a	 remark 	 able 	 	sort	of	 in 	 consist 	 ency 	 	in	 ideo 	 logy 	 	,	to	be	honest	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	other	thing	is	that	power	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 s 	 e 	 duct 	 ive 	 	,	and	you	must	have	two	real	 qual 	 ities 	 	,	i	think	,	when	you	come	to	the	table	,	when	you	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	power	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	power	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 e 	 duct 	 ive 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
you	've	got	to	have	 skeptic 	 ism 	 	and	 humil 	 ity 	 	.
 skeptic 	 ism 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	must	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 challeng 	 ing 	 	.
i	want	to	see	why	do	you	--	you	just	say	so	?	that	's	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
i	want	to	see	the	evidence	 be 	 hind 	 	why	that	's	so	.
and	 humil 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	all	human	.	we	all	make	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
and	if	you	do	n't	have	 skeptic 	 ism 	 	and	 humil 	 ity 	 	,	then	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	short	journey	to	go	from	 reform 	 er 	 	to	 auto 	 crat 	 	,	and	i	think	you	 on 	 ly 	 	have	to	read	``	animal	farm	``	to	get	that	 mess 	 age 	 	about	how	power	 corrupt 	 s 	 	people	.
so	what	is	the	solution	?	it	is	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	to	 em 	 body 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	rule	of	law	 right 	 s 	 	to	information	.
at	the	moment	our	 right 	 s 	 	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	weak	.
in	a	lot	of	 count 	 ries 	 	,	we	have	official	 secret 	 s 	 	 act 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	in	britain	here	.	we	have	an	official	 secret 	 s 	 	act	with	no	public	interest	test	.	so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	it	's	a	crime	,	people	are	 punish 	 ed 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 severe 	 ly 	 	in	a	lot	of	 case 	 s 	 	,	for	 publish 	 ing 	 	or	giving	away	official	information	.
now	would	n't	it	be	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	want	all	of	you	to	think	about	,	if	we	had	an	official	 dis 	 closure 	 	act	where	 official 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 punish 	 ed 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	found	to	have	 suppress 	 ed 	 	or	 hid 	 den 	 	information	that	was	in	the	public	interest	?
so	that	--	 y 	 es 	 	.	 y 	 es 	 	!	my	power	pose	.
i	would	like	us	to	work	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	that	.
so	it	's	not	all	bad	news	.	i	mean	,	there	 definite 	 ly 	 	is	progress	on	the	line	,	but	i	think	what	we	find	is	that	the	 close 	 r 	 	that	we	get	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	heart	of	power	,	the	more	 opa 	 que 	 	,	closed	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	.
so	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	just	the	other	week	that	i	heard	london	's	 metro 	 politan 	 	police	 commission 	 er 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	why	the	police	need	access	to	all	of	our	 communication 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 py 	 ing 	 	on	us	 with 	 out 	 	any	 judi 	 cial 	 	 over 	 sight 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	it	was	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
there	was	no	evidence	.	he	 present 	 ed 	 	no	evidence	of	that	.
it	was	just	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	i	say	so	.
you	have	to	trust	me	.	take	it	on	faith	.	``
well	,	i	'm	sorry	,	people	,	but	we	are	back	to	the	pre	-	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	church	,	and	we	need	to	fight	against	that	.
so	he	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	law	in	britain	which	is	the	 communication 	 s 	 	data	bill	,	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	piece	of	 legisl 	 ation 	 	.
in	america	,	you	have	the	cyber	 intellig 	 ence 	 	sharing	and	 protect 	 ion 	 	act	.
you	've	got	 drone 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 ing 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	for	domestic	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	.
you	have	the	national	security	 age 	 ncy 	 	building	the	world	's	 giant 	 est 	 	 s 	 py 	 	center	.	it	's	just	 th 	 is 	 	colossal	--	it	's	five	 time 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	the	u.s.	 cap 	 itol 	 	,	in	which	they	're	going	to	 inter 	 cept 	 	and	 analyz 	 e 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	,	traffic	and	personal	data	to	try	and	figure	out	who	's	the	 trouble 	 maker 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
well	,	to	go	back	to	our	original	story	,	the	 parent 	 s 	 	have	 panic 	 ked 	 	.	they	've	 lock 	 ed 	 	all	the	 door 	 s 	 	.
they	've	 kid 	 d 	 ed 	 	out	the	house	with	cctv	 camera 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	all	of	us	.	they	've	 d 	 ug 	 	a	 base 	 ment 	 	,	and	they	've	built	a	 s 	 py 	 	center	to	try	and	run	 algorithm 	 s 	 	and	figure	out	which	 one 	 s 	 	of	us	are	 trouble 	 some 	 	,	and	if	any	of	us	complain	about	that	,	we	're	 arrest 	 ed 	 	for	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
well	,	is	that	a	 fair 	 y 	 	tale	or	a	living	nightmare	?
some	 fair 	 y 	 	 tale 	 s 	 	have	happy	 end 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	some	do	n't	.
i	think	we	've	all	read	the	grimms	'	 fair 	 y 	 	 tale 	 s 	 	,	which	are	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	grim	.
but	the	world	is	n't	a	 fair 	 y 	 	tale	,	and	it	could	be	more	brutal	than	we	want	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	.
 equal 	 ly 	 	,	it	could	be	better	than	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	led	to	 believ 	 e 	 	,	but	either	way	,	we	have	to	start	 see 	 ing 	 	it	 exact 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	with	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	by	 see 	 ing 	 	it	with	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	'll	be	able	to	fix	them	and	live	in	a	world	in	which	we	can	all	be	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	ever	after	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
thank	you	.
