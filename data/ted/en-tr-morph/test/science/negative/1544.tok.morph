 th 	 is 	 	story	 start 	 s 	 	:	i	was	at	a	friend	's	house	,	and	she	had	on	her	shelf	a	copy	of	the	dsm	manual	,	which	is	the	manual	of	mental	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
it	 list 	 s 	 	every	known	mental	 dis 	 order 	 	.
and	it	used	to	be	,	back	in	the	'50s	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 lim 	 	pamphlet	.
and	then	it	got	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	,	and	now	it	's	886	 page 	 s 	 	long	.
and	it	 list 	 s 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	374	mental	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
so	i	was	 leaf 	 ing 	 	through	it	,	 wonder 	 ing 	 	if	i	had	any	mental	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	i	've	got	12	.
i	've	got	 general 	 ized 	 	 anxie 	 ty 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	,	which	is	a	 give 	 n 	 	.
i	've	got	nightmare	 dis 	 order 	 	,	which	is	 categor 	 ized 	 	if	you	have	 re 	 current 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 pursue 	 d 	 	or	 declare 	 d 	 	a	failure	--	and	all	my	 dream 	 s 	 	involve	people	chasing	me	down	the	street	going	,	``	you	're	a	failure	.	``
i	've	got	parent	-	child	 relation 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	which	i	blame	my	 parent 	 s 	 	for	.
i	'm	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.	i	'm	not	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	've	got	 ma 	 linger 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	think	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	rare	to	have	both	 ma 	 linger 	 ing 	 	and	 general 	 ized 	 	 anxie 	 ty 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 ma 	 linger 	 ing 	 	 tend 	 s 	 	to	make	me	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 anx 	 ious 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	i	was	looking	through	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	 wonder 	 ing 	 	if	i	was	much	 crazi 	 er 	 	than	i	thought	i	was	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	not	a	good	idea	to	 diagnos 	 e 	 	 your 	 self 	 	with	a	mental	 dis 	 order 	 	if	you	're	not	a	trained	professional	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	the	 psych 	 iatry 	 	profession	 ha 	 s 	 	a	strange	 desir 	 e 	 	to	label	what	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	normal	human	behavior	 a 	 s 	 	a	mental	 dis 	 order 	 	.
i	did	n't	know	which	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	was	true	,	but	i	thought	it	was	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	thought	 may 	 be 	 	i	should	meet	a	critic	of	 psych 	 iatry 	 	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	view	.
which	is	how	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 hav 	 ing 	 	lunch	with	the	scientologists	.
it	was	a	man	 call 	 ed 	 	brian	who	 run 	 s 	 	a	crack	team	of	scientologists	who	are	 determine 	 d 	 	to	destroy	 psych 	 iatry 	 	 where 	 ver 	 	it	lies	.
they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	the	cchr	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	``	can	you	prove	to	me	that	 psych 	 iatry 	 	is	a	pseudo	-	science	that	ca	n't	be	 trust 	 ed 	 	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	can	prove	it	to	you	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	're	going	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	tony	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	who	's	tony	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	tony	's	in	broadmoor	.	``
now	broadmoor	is	broadmoor	hospital	.
it	used	to	be	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	broadmoor	asylum	for	the	criminally	 insan 	 e 	 	.
it	's	where	they	 s 	 end 	 	the	 s 	 erial 	 	 killer 	 s 	 	and	the	people	who	ca	n't	help	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	brian	,	``	what	did	tony	do	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 hard 	 ly 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
he	beat	 some 	 one 	 	up	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	he	 decide 	 d 	 	to	fake	 mad 	 ness 	 	to	get	out	of	a	 pri 	 son 	 	sentence	.
but	he	 fak 	 ed 	 	it	too	well	,	and	now	he	's	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	broadmoor	and	 no 	 body 	 	will	 believ 	 e 	 	he	's	 s 	 ane 	 	.

and	in	fact	,	 fak 	 ing 	 	 mad 	 ness 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	kind	of	 cunn 	 ing 	 	and	 manipul 	 ative 	 	act	of	a	psychopath	.
it	's	on	the	 check 	 list 	 	:	 cunn 	 ing 	 	and	 manipul 	 ative 	 	.
so	 fak 	 ing 	 	your	brain	going	wrong	is	evidence	that	your	brain	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	wrong	.
and	i	spoke	to	other	 expert 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	the	 pin 	 strip 	 ed 	 	suit	--	classic	psychopath	.

so	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	had	 seem 	 ed 	 	most	normal	about	tony	was	evidence	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	his	 clinic 	 ian 	 	,	that	he	was	mad	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	way	.
he	was	a	psychopath	.
and	his	 clinic 	 ian 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	if	you	want	to	know	more	about	 psychopath 	 s 	 	,	you	can	go	on	a	psychopath	 spot 	 ting 	 	course	run	by	robert	 ha 	 re 	 	who	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	psychopath	 check 	 list 	 	.	``

in	fact	,	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	at	 it 	 s 	 	most	 remorse 	 less 	 	,	is	a	physical	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	 psychopath 	 y 	 	.
it	's	like	a	form	of	 psychopath 	 y 	 	that	's	come	down	to	affect	us	all	.

but	i	did	notice	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	me	the	day	i	was	with	al	dunlap	.
 when 	 ever 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	to	me	that	was	kind	of	normal	--	like	he	 s 	 aid 	 	no	to	juvenile	 deli 	 nq 	 uency 	 	.

so	 when 	 ever 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	to	me	that	just	 seem 	 ed 	 	kind	of	non	-	 psychopath 	 ic 	 	,	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	well	i	'm	not	going	to	put	that	in	my	book	.
and	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 be 	 coming 	 	a	psychopath	 s 	 potter 	 	had	 turn 	 ed 	 	me	a	little	bit	 psychopath 	 ic 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	desperate	to	shove	him	in	a	box	 mark 	 ed 	 	psychopath	.
i	was	desperate	to	define	him	by	his	 mad 	 d 	 est 	 	 edge 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	oh	my	god	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	what	all	 journalist 	 s 	 	do	.
we	travel	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	with	our	 note 	 pad 	 s 	 	in	our	 hand 	 s 	 	,	and	we	wait	for	the	 gem 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 gem 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	the	 out 	 er 	 most 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	our	 interview 	 ee 	 	's	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
and	we	stitch	them	together	like	 med 	 ieval 	 	 monk 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 leav 	 e 	 	the	normal	stuff	on	the	floor	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	country	that	over	-	 diagnos 	 es 	 	certain	mental	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	 huge 	 ly 	 	.

when	i	got	back	to	london	,	tony	 phone 	 d 	 	me	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	have	n't	you	 be 	 en 	 	 return 	 ing 	 	my	 call 	 s 	 	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	they	say	that	you	're	a	psychopath	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	not	a	psychopath	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	,	one	of	the	 item 	 s 	 	on	the	 check 	 list 	 	is	lack	of	remorse	,	but	 an 	 other 	 	item	on	the	 check 	 list 	 	is	 cunn 	 ing 	 	,	 manipul 	 ative 	 	.
so	when	you	say	you	feel	remorse	for	your	crime	,	they	say	,	'	typical	of	the	psychopath	to	 cunn 	 ing 	 ly 	 	say	he	 feel 	 s 	 	remorse	when	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.	'	it	's	like	 witch 	 craft 	 	.	they	turn	 every 	 thing 	 	 up 	 side 	 	-	down	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	got	a	 trib 	 un 	 al 	 	coming	up	.
will	you	come	to	it	?	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	i	went	to	his	 trib 	 un 	 al 	 	.
and	after	14	 year 	 s 	 	in	broadmoor	,	they	let	him	go	.
they	 decide 	 d 	 	that	he	should	n't	be	held	 in 	 definite 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 score 	 s 	 	high	on	a	 check 	 list 	 	that	might	mean	that	he	would	have	a	 great 	 er 	 	than	average	chance	of	 recid 	 ivism 	 	.
so	they	let	him	go	.
and	 out 	 side 	 	in	the	corridor	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	you	know	what	,	jon	?
 every 	 one 	 	's	a	bit	 psychopath 	 ic 	 	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	are	.	i	am	.	well	 obvious 	 ly 	 	i	am.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	are	you	going	to	do	now	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	go	to	belgium	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	woman	there	that	i	 f 	 ancy 	 	.
but	she	's	married	,	so	i	'm	going	to	have	to	get	her	split	up	from	her	husband	.	``
 any 	 way 	 	,	that	was	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	that	's	where	my	book	 end 	 ed 	 	.
and	for	the	last	20	 month 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	was	fine	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	bad	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
he	was	living	with	a	girl	 out 	 side 	 	london	.
he	was	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	brian	the	scientologist	,	making	up	for	lost	time	--	which	i	know	 sound 	 s 	 	ominous	,	but	is	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	ominous	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	after	20	 month 	 s 	 	,	he	did	go	back	to	jail	for	a	month	.
he	got	 in 	 to 	 	a	 fr 	 acas 	 	in	a	bar	,	he	 call 	 ed 	 	it	--	 end 	 ed 	 	up	going	to	jail	for	a	month	,	which	i	know	is	bad	,	but	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	month	 im 	 plies 	 	that	 what 	 ever 	 	the	 fr 	 acas 	 	was	,	it	was	n't	too	bad	.
and	then	he	 phone 	 d 	 	me	.
and	you	know	what	,	i	think	it	's	right	that	tony	is	out	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	should	n't	define	people	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 mad 	 d 	 est 	 	 edge 	 s 	 	.
and	what	tony	is	,	is	he	's	a	semi	-	psychopath	.
he	's	a	gray	area	in	a	world	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	like	gray	 area 	 s 	 	.
but	the	gray	 area 	 s 	 	are	where	you	find	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	it	's	where	you	find	the	 human 	 ity 	 	and	it	's	where	you	find	the	truth	.
and	tony	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	jon	,	could	i	buy	you	a	drink	in	a	bar	?
i	just	want	to	thank	you	for	 every 	 thing 	 	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	for	me	.	``
and	i	did	n't	go	.	what	would	you	have	 d 	 one 	 	?
thank	you	.
