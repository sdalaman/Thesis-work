my	own	mother	--	and	i	should	say	 th 	 is 	 	here	--	she	same	to	 th 	 is 	 	country	in	the	late	'60s	,	and	she	was	,	you	know	,	she	found	 her 	 self 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	women	did	in	the	late	'60s	.	you	know	what	i	mean	?
they	found	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	.
and	she	sort	of	,	she	had	no	idea	of	the	 con 	 text 	 	in	which	she	'd	 land 	 ed 	 	.
in	the	1960s	--	i	should	give	you	some	 con 	 text 	 	--	in	the	1960s	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	and	you	 we 	 re 	 	single	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	threat	to	the	community	.
you	 we 	 re 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	your	family	by	the	state	.

the	 adopt 	 ive 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	lined	up	.
it	was	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	purpose	of	the	social	 work 	 er 	 	,	the	aim	,	to	get	the	woman	at	her	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	time	in	her	entire	life	,	to	sign	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 sign 	 ed 	 	.
the	mother	and	baby	's	 home 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	often	run	by	 n 	 un 	 s 	 	.

a	little	break	.
a	little	break	.
the	first	secret	of	shame	for	a	woman	for	 be 	 ing 	 	a	woman	,	``	a	little	break	.	``
the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	process	took	,	like	,	a	matter	of	 month 	 s 	 	,	so	it	was	a	closed	shop	,	you	know	,	 seal 	 ed 	 	deal	,	an	industrious	,	 util 	 itarian 	 	solution	:	the	government	,	the	 farm 	 er 	 	,	the	 adopt 	 ing 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	the	consumer	,	the	mother	,	the	earth	,	and	the	child	,	the	crop	.
it	's	kind	of	easy	to	 patron 	 ize 	 	the	past	,	to	 fore 	 go 	 	our	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	in	the	present	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	then	is	a	direct	 reflect 	 ion 	 	of	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	.	 every 	 body 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	the	right	thing	by	god	and	by	the	state	for	the	big	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	fast	-	 track 	 ing 	 	 adopt 	 ion 	 	.
so	 any 	 way 	 	,	she	 come 	 s 	 	here	,	1967	,	she	's	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	and	she	 come 	 s 	 	from	ethiopia	that	was	 celebr 	 ating 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	jubilee	at	the	time	under	the	emperor	haile	selassie	,	and	she	 land 	 s 	 	 month 	 s 	 	before	the	enoch	powell	speech	,	the	``	 river 	 s 	 	of	blood	``	speech	.
she	 land 	 s 	 	 month 	 s 	 	before	the	beatles	 re 	 lease 	 	``	the	white	 al 	 bum 	 	,	``	 month 	 s 	 	before	martin	luther	king	was	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	a	summer	of	love	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	white	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	black	,	it	was	a	summer	of	hate	.
so	she	 go 	 es 	 	from	oxford	,	she	's	 s 	 ent 	 	to	the	north	of	england	to	a	mother	and	baby	home	,	and	 ap 	 point 	 ed 	 	a	social	 work 	 er 	 	.
it	's	her	plan	.	you	know	,	i	have	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 house 	 s 	 	--	it	's	her	plan	to	have	me	 foster 	 ed 	 	for	a	short	period	of	time	while	she	 stud 	 ies 	 	.	but	the	social	 work 	 er 	 	,	he	had	a	different	agenda	.
he	found	the	foster	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	them	,	``	treat	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 adopt 	 ion 	 	.	he	's	 your 	 s 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
his	name	is	norman	.	``

so	they	took	me	.	i	was	a	 mess 	 age 	 	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	.
i	was	a	sign	from	god	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	.
i	was	norman	mark	greenwood	.
now	,	for	the	next	11	 year 	 s 	 	,	all	i	know	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	woman	,	 th 	 is 	 	birth	woman	,	should	have	her	 eye 	 s 	 	 scratch 	 ed 	 	out	for	not	 sign 	 ing 	 	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	.	she	was	an	 e 	 vil 	 	woman	too	 self 	 ish 	 	to	sign	,	so	i	 s 	 pent 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	11	 year 	 s 	 	 knee 	 ling 	 	and	 pray 	 ing 	 	.

``	god	,	can	i	have	a	bike	for	christmas	?	``
but	i	would	 al 	 ways 	 	answer	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	of	course	you	can	.	``
and	then	i	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	determine	 whet 	 her 	 	that	was	the	voice	of	god	or	it	was	the	voice	of	the	devil	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	i	've	got	the	devil	 in 	 side 	 	of	me	.
who	 k 	 new 	 	?
so	 any 	 way 	 	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	sort	of	 pass 	 ed 	 	,	and	they	had	a	child	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	,	and	then	 an 	 other 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	,	and	they	had	 an 	 other 	 	child	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	,	and	then	 an 	 other 	 	time	 pass 	 ed 	 	and	they	had	 an 	 other 	 	child	that	they	 call 	 ed 	 	an	accident	,	which	i	thought	was	an	 un 	 usual 	 	name	.
and	i	was	on	the	 cus 	 p 	 	of	,	sort	of	,	adolescence	,	so	i	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	take	biscuits	from	the	tin	 with 	 out 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	stay	out	a	little	bit	late	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
now	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 relig 	 io 	 s 	 ity 	 	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 naive 	 te 	 	,	my	mom	and	dad	,	which	i	 believ 	 ed 	 	them	to	be	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	my	mom	and	dad	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	that	i	had	the	devil	 in 	 side 	 	of	me	.
and	what	--	i	should	say	 th 	 is 	 	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	they	engineered	my	 leav 	 ing 	 	.
they	 s 	 at 	 	me	at	a	table	,	my	foster	mom	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	you	do	n't	love	us	,	do	you	?	``	at	11	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
they	've	had	three	other	children	.	i	'm	the	fourth	.	the	third	was	an	accident	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	of	course	i	do	.	``	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	.
my	foster	mother	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	go	away	to	think	about	love	and	what	it	is	and	to	read	the	 script 	 ures 	 	and	to	come	back	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	and	give	my	most	honest	and	 truth 	 ful 	 	answer	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	 whet 	 her 	 	i	 love 	 d 	 	them	or	not	,	then	i	must	n't	love	them	,	which	led	me	to	the	miracle	of	thought	that	i	thought	they	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	get	to	.
``	i	will	ask	god	for	 forgive 	 ness 	 	and	his	light	will	shine	through	me	to	them	.	how	fantastic	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
the	 the 	 ology 	 	was	perfect	,	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	 un 	 question 	 able 	 	,	and	the	answer	 a 	 s 	 	honest	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 inner 	 	could	get	.
``	i	must	n't	love	you	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	them	.	``	but	i	will	ask	god	for	 forgive 	 ness 	 	.	``
``	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	love	us	,	norman	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	you	've	 chose 	 n 	 	your	path	.	``
twenty	-	four	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	my	social	 work 	 er 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	strange	man	who	used	to	visit	me	every	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	,	he	's	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	me	in	the	car	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	 good 	 bye 	 	to	my	 parent 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	say	 good 	 bye 	 	to	 any 	 body 	 	,	not	my	mother	,	my	father	,	my	 sister 	 s 	 	,	my	 brother 	 s 	 	,	my	 aunt 	 s 	 	,	my	 uncle 	 s 	 	,	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	my	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 no 	 body 	 	.
on	the	way	to	the	children	's	home	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	?	``
it	's	not	that	i	'd	had	the	rug	 pull 	 ed 	 	from	 be 	 neath 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	entire	floor	had	 be 	 en 	 	taken	away	.
when	i	got	to	the	--	for	the	next	four	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	was	held	in	four	different	children	's	 home 	 s 	 	.
on	the	third	children	's	home	,	at	15	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	rebel	,	and	what	i	did	was	,	i	got	three	 tin 	 s 	 	of	paint	,	airfix	paint	that	you	use	for	 model 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	--	it	was	a	big	children	's	home	,	big	victorian	children	's	home	--	and	i	was	in	a	little	 tur 	 ret 	 	at	the	top	of	it	,	and	i	 pour 	 ed 	 	them	,	red	,	yellow	and	green	,	the	 color 	 s 	 	of	africa	,	down	the	 tile 	 s 	 	.
you	could	n't	see	it	from	the	street	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	home	was	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 bee 	 ch 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	.
for	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	was	 incarce 	 rated 	 	for	a	year	in	an	 assess 	 ment 	 	center	which	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 re 	 man 	 d 	 	center	.	it	was	a	virtual	 pri 	 son 	 	for	young	people	.
by	the	way	,	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	my	social	 work 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	i	should	never	have	 be 	 en 	 	put	in	there	.
i	was	n't	charged	for	 any 	 thing 	 	.	i	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	wrong	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	no	family	to	 inquir 	 e 	 	about	me	,	they	could	do	 any 	 thing 	 	to	me	.
i	'm	17	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	they	had	a	 padd 	 ed 	 	cell	.
they	would	march	me	down	 corridor 	 s 	 	in	last	-	 s 	 ize 	 	order	.
they	--	i	was	put	in	a	 dorm 	 itor 	 y 	 	with	a	 confirm 	 ed 	 	nazi	 sympath 	 izer 	 	.
all	of	the	staff	 we 	 re 	 	ex	-	police	--	 interest 	 ing 	 	--	and	ex	-	 prob 	 ation 	 	 officer 	 s 	 	.
the	man	who	ran	it	was	an	ex	-	 arm 	 y 	 	officer	.
every	time	i	had	a	visit	by	a	person	who	i	did	not	know	who	would	feed	me	 grape 	 s 	 	,	once	every	three	 month 	 s 	 	,	i	was	strip	-	 search 	 ed 	 	.
that	home	was	full	of	young	 boy 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	on	 re 	 man 	 d 	 	for	 thing 	 s 	 	like	murder	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	that	i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 give 	 n 	 	after	17	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	of	the	state	.
i	have	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
i	have	to	tell	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	no	one	to	put	two	and	two	together	.
i	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	aware	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	 no 	 body 	 	that	 k 	 new 	 	me	for	 long 	 er 	 	than	a	year	.
see	,	that	's	what	family	 do 	 es 	 	.
it	 give 	 s 	 	you	 re 	 ference 	 	 point 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	 defi 	 ning 	 	a	good	family	from	a	bad	family	.
i	'm	just	 say 	 ing 	 	that	you	know	when	your	 birth 	 day 	 	is	by	virtue	of	the	fact	that	 some 	 body 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	when	your	 birth 	 day 	 	is	,	a	mother	,	a	father	,	a	sister	,	a	brother	,	an	aunt	,	an	uncle	,	a	cousin	,	a	 grand 	 parent 	 	.	it	 matter 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 one 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	it	 matter 	 s 	 	to	you	.	understand	,	i	was	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 tuck 	 ed 	 	away	in	 my 	 self 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	i	was	n't	 touch 	 ed 	 	either	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	.
i	'm	 report 	 ing 	 	back	.	i	'm	 report 	 ing 	 	back	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	say	that	when	i	left	the	children	's	home	i	had	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	.	one	was	to	find	my	family	,	and	the	other	was	to	write	 poet 	 ry 	 	.
in	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	i	saw	light	.
in	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	i	saw	the	 end 	 less 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	life	,	the	 end 	 less 	 	truth	,	the	permanent	creation	of	 re 	 ality 	 	,	the	place	where	anger	was	an	 express 	 ion 	 	in	the	search	for	love	,	a	place	where	 dy 	 s 	 function 	 	is	a	true	 re 	 action 	 	to	 un 	 truth 	 	.
i	've	just	got	to	say	it	to	you	all	:	i	found	all	of	my	family	in	my	adult	life	.	i	 s 	 pent 	 	all	of	my	adult	life	 find 	 ing 	 	them	,	and	i	've	now	got	a	fully	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	family	just	like	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
but	i	'm	 report 	 ing 	 	back	to	you	to	say	 quit 	 e 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	that	you	can	define	how	strong	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	by	how	 it 	 s 	 	government	 treat 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	child	.
i	do	n't	mean	children	.	i	mean	the	child	of	the	state	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	honor	.
