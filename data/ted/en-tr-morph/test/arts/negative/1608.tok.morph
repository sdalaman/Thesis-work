two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	after	 hav 	 ing 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	marine	 corp 	 s 	 	and	 deploy 	 ments 	 	to	both	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	afghanistan	,	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	port	-	au	-	prince	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	a	team	of	 veteran 	 s 	 	and	medical	 professional 	 s 	 	in	some	of	the	 hard 	 est 	 	-	hit	 area 	 s 	 	of	that	city	,	three	 day 	 s 	 	after	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	else	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	,	the	 place 	 s 	 	 no 	 body 	 	else	could	go	,	and	after	three	 week 	 s 	 	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.	 militar 	 y 	 	 veteran 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	disaster	 respons 	 e 	 	.
and	coming	home	,	my	 co 	 founder 	 	and	i	,	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	are	two	 problem 	 s 	 	.
the	first	problem	is	there	's	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	disaster	 respons 	 e 	 	.
it	's	 s 	 low 	 	.	it	's	 anti 	 qu 	 ated 	 	.	it	's	not	using	the	best	technology	,	and	it	's	not	using	the	best	people	.
the	second	problem	that	we	 be 	 came 	 	aware	of	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	veteran	 re 	 integ 	 ration 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 top 	 ic 	 	that	is	front	page	news	right	now	 a 	 s 	 	 veteran 	 s 	 	are	coming	home	from	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	afghanistan	,	and	they	're	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	 re 	 integrate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 civil 	 ian 	 	life	.
and	we	 s 	 at 	 	here	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	these	two	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	we	came	to	a	 real 	 ization 	 	.	these	are	n't	 problem 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.	and	what	do	i	mean	by	that	?
well	,	we	can	use	disaster	 respons 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	service	for	the	 veteran 	 s 	 	coming	home	.
 re 	 cent 	 	 survey 	 s 	 	show	that	92	percent	of	 veteran 	 s 	 	want	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	service	when	they	take	off	 the 	 ir 	 	uniform	.
and	we	can	use	 veteran 	 s 	 	to	improve	disaster	 respons 	 e 	 	.
now	on	the	surface	,	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	sense	,	and	in	2010	,	we	 respond 	 ed 	 	to	the	tsunami	in	chile	,	the	 flood 	 s 	 	in	pakistan	,	we	 s 	 ent 	 	training	 team 	 s 	 	to	the	thai	-	burma	border	.
but	it	was	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	when	one	of	our	original	 member 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	us	to	shift	focus	in	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	clay	hunt	.	clay	was	a	marine	with	me	.
we	 serv 	 ed 	 	together	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	afghanistan	.
clay	was	with	us	in	port	-	au	-	prince	.	he	was	 al 	 so 	 	with	us	in	chile	.
 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	in	march	,	clay	took	his	own	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	,	but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 force 	 d 	 	us	to	 re 	 focus 	 	what	it	is	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	clay	did	n't	kill	 him 	 self 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	afghanistan	.	clay	 kill 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	he	lost	when	he	came	home	.
he	lost	purpose	.	he	lost	his	community	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 tragic 	 ally 	 	,	he	lost	his	self	-	worth	.
and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 evaluate 	 d 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	dust	 settl 	 ed 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	of	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 problem 	 s 	 	--	in	the	 initi 	 al 	 	iteration	of	our	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	a	disaster	 respons 	 e 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	was	using	veteran	service	.	we	had	a	lot	of	success	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	like	we	 we 	 re 	 	changing	the	disaster	 respons 	 e 	 	paradigm	.
but	after	clay	,	we	 shift 	 ed 	 	that	focus	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	now	moving	forward	,	we	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	veteran	service	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	's	using	disaster	 respons 	 e 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	that	we	can	give	that	purpose	and	that	community	and	that	self	-	worth	back	to	the	veteran	.
and	 tornado 	 es 	 	in	tuscaloosa	and	joplin	,	and	then	 lat 	 er 	 	hurricane	irene	,	 g 	 ave 	 	us	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	look	at	that	.
now	i	want	you	to	imagine	for	a	second	an	18	-	year	-	old	boy	who	 graduate 	 s 	 	from	high	school	in	kansas	city	,	missouri	.
he	 join 	 s 	 	the	 arm 	 y 	 	.	the	 arm 	 y 	 	 give 	 s 	 	him	a	rifle	.
they	 s 	 end 	 	him	to	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
every	day	he	 leav 	 es 	 	the	wire	with	a	mission	.
that	mission	is	to	defend	the	 free 	 dom 	 	of	the	family	that	he	left	at	home	.
it	's	to	keep	the	men	around	him	 al 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	to	 pac 	 ify 	 	the	village	that	he	 work 	 s 	 	in	.
he	's	got	a	purpose	.	but	he	 come 	 s 	 	home	[	to	]	kansas	city	,	missouri	,	 may 	 be 	 	he	 go 	 es 	 	to	college	,	 may 	 be 	 	he	's	got	a	job	,	but	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	that	same	sense	of	purpose	.
you	give	him	a	 chain 	 saw 	 	.	you	 s 	 end 	 	him	to	joplin	,	missouri	after	a	tornado	,	he	 regain 	 s 	 	that	.
going	back	,	that	same	18	-	year	-	old	boy	 graduate 	 s 	 	from	high	school	in	kansas	city	,	missouri	,	 join 	 s 	 	the	 arm 	 y 	 	,	the	 arm 	 y 	 	 give 	 s 	 	him	a	rifle	,	they	 s 	 end 	 	him	to	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
every	day	he	 look 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	same	 set 	 s 	 	of	 eye 	 s 	 	around	him	.
he	 leav 	 es 	 	the	wire	.	he	 know 	 s 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	people	have	his	back	.
he	's	slept	in	the	same	sand	.	they	've	lived	together	.
they	've	eaten	together	.	they	've	bled	together	.
he	 go 	 es 	 	home	to	kansas	city	,	missouri	.
he	 get 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 militar 	 y 	 	.	he	 take 	 s 	 	his	uniform	off	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	that	community	 any 	 more 	 	.
but	you	drop	25	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 veteran 	 s 	 	in	joplin	,	missouri	,	they	get	that	sense	of	community	back	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	have	an	18	-	year	-	old	boy	who	 graduate 	 s 	 	high	school	in	kansas	city	.
he	 join 	 s 	 	the	 arm 	 y 	 	.	the	 arm 	 y 	 	 give 	 s 	 	him	a	rifle	.
they	 s 	 end 	 	him	to	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
they	pin	a	 med 	 al 	 	on	his	chest	.	he	 go 	 es 	 	home	to	a	 tick 	 er 	 	tape	 para 	 de 	 	.
he	 take 	 s 	 	the	uniform	off	.	he	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	 s 	 er 	 ge 	 ant 	 	jones	in	his	community	.	he	's	now	dave	from	kansas	city	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	that	same	self	-	worth	.
but	you	 s 	 end 	 	him	to	joplin	after	a	tornado	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	once	 aga 	 in 	 	is	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	to	him	and	 sha 	 king 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	and	 thank 	 ing 	 	them	for	 the 	 ir 	 	service	,	now	they	have	self	-	worth	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	right	now	 some 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	step	up	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	generation	of	 veteran 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	do	that	if	they	are	 give 	 n 	 	the	chance	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
