chris	anderson	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	i	could	put	the	last	25	 year 	 s 	 	of	anti	-	poverty	 campaign 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	for	ted	.
that	's	an	englishman	 ask 	 ing 	 	an	irishman	to	be	succinct	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	chris	,	that	would	take	a	miracle	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	bono	,	would	n't	that	be	a	good	use	of	your	 mess 	 ian 	 ic 	 	complex	?	``
so	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
then	i	thought	,	let	's	go	even	further	than	25	 year 	 s 	 	.
let	's	go	back	before	christ	,	three	millennia	,	to	a	time	when	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	my	head	,	the	journey	for	justice	,	the	march	against	 ine 	 quality 	 	and	poverty	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	.
three	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 civil 	 ization 	 	just	 get 	 ting 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	on	the	 bank 	 s 	 	of	the	nile	,	some	 slave 	 s 	 	,	jewish	 shepherd 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 smell 	 ing 	 	of	sheep	shit	,	i	guess	,	 pro 	 claim 	 ed 	 	to	the	pharaoh	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	high	on	his	 thr 	 one 	 	,	``	we	,	your	 majes 	 ty 	 	-	ness	,	are	equal	to	you	.	``
and	the	pharaoh	 re 	 plies 	 	,	``	oh	,	no	.
you	,	your	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 ness 	 	,	have	got	to	be	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	they	say	,	``	no	,	no	,	that	's	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	here	in	our	holy	book	.	``
cut	to	our	century	,	same	country	,	same	 pyramid 	 s 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	people	 spread 	 ing 	 	the	same	idea	of	 e 	 quality 	 	with	a	different	book	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	facebook	.
 crowd 	 s 	 	are	 gather 	 ed 	 	in	tahrir	square	.
they	turn	a	social	network	from	virtual	to	actual	,	and	kind	of	 re 	 boot 	 ed 	 	the	21st	century	.
not	to	 under 	 sell 	 	how	 mess 	 y 	 	and	 ug 	 ly 	 	the	 after 	 math 	 	of	the	arab	spring	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	 n 	 either 	 	to	 over 	 sell 	 	the	role	of	technology	,	but	these	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 give 	 n 	 	a	sense	of	what	's	possible	when	the	age	-	old	model	of	power	,	the	pyramid	,	 get 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 up 	 side 	 	down	,	 put 	 ting 	 	the	people	on	top	and	the	pharaohs	of	 to 	 day 	 	on	the	bottom	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 show 	 n 	 	us	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	information	and	the	sharing	of	it	can	 challeng 	 e 	 	 ine 	 quality 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	,	like	people	,	want	to	be	free	,	and	when	they	're	free	,	 liber 	 ty 	 	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	around	the	corner	,	even	for	the	 poor 	 est 	 	of	the	poor	--	 fact 	 s 	 	that	can	 challeng 	 e 	 	 cynic 	 ism 	 	and	the	 a 	 pathy 	 	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 in 	 ertia 	 	,	 fact 	 s 	 	that	tell	us	what	's	 work 	 ing 	 	and	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	what	's	not	,	so	we	can	fix	it	,	 fact 	 s 	 	that	if	we	hear	them	and	 he 	 ed 	 	them	could	help	us	meet	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	nelson	mandela	made	back	in	2005	,	when	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	be	that	great	generation	that	overcomes	that	most	awful	offense	to	 human 	 ity 	 	,	 extrem 	 e 	 	poverty	,	 fact 	 s 	 	that	build	a	 power 	 ful 	 	 moment 	 um 	 	.
so	i	thought	,	forget	the	rock	opera	,	forget	the	 bomb 	 ast 	 	,	my	usual	 trick 	 s 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	would	be	the	 fact 	 s 	 	,	for	i	have	 tru 	 ly 	 	 embrace 	 d 	 	by	inner	nerd	.
so	exit	the	rock	star	.
enter	the	evidence	-	based	activist	,	the	 f 	 activist 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	the	 fact 	 s 	 	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	is	that	the	long	,	 s 	 low 	 	journey	,	 human 	 ity 	 	's	long	,	 s 	 low 	 	journey	of	 e 	 quality 	 	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	.
look	at	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	.
look	at	the	 picture 	 s 	 	these	data	 set 	 s 	 	print	.
since	the	year	2000	,	since	the	turn	of	the	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	,	there	are	eight	million	more	 aid 	 s 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	life	-	saving	 anti 	 retroviral 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	.
malaria	:	there	are	eight	 count 	 ries 	 	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	that	have	 the 	 ir 	 	death	rates	cut	by	75	percent	.
for	 kid 	 s 	 	under	five	,	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	 kid 	 s 	 	under	five	,	it	's	down	by	2.65	million	a	year	.
that	's	a	rate	of	7,256	children	's	 live 	 s 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	each	day	.
 w 	 ow 	 	.	 w 	 ow 	 	.
let	's	just	stop	for	a	second	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	and	think	about	that	.
have	you	read	 any 	 thing 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	last	week	that	is	 remote 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	number	?	 w 	 ow 	 	.
great	news	.	it	 drive 	 s 	 	me	nuts	that	most	people	do	n't	seem	to	know	 th 	 is 	 	news	.
seven	thousand	 kid 	 s 	 	a	day	.	here	's	two	of	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	michael	and	benedicta	,	and	they	're	 al 	 ive 	 	 thank 	 s 	 	in	large	part	to	dr.	patricia	asamoah	--	she	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	--	and	the	global	fund	,	which	all	of	you	 financial 	 ly 	 	support	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	know	it	or	not	.
and	the	global	fund	 provide 	 s 	 	 anti 	 retroviral 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	that	stop	 mother 	 s 	 	from	 pass 	 ing 	 	hiv	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	news	did	n't	happen	by	 it 	 self 	 	.
it	was	 f 	 ought 	 	for	,	it	was	 campaign 	 ed 	 	for	,	it	was	 innov 	 ated 	 	for	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	great	news	 give 	 s 	 	birth	to	even	more	great	news	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	historic	trend	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	number	of	people	living	in	back	-	 break 	 ing 	 	,	soul	-	 crush 	 ing 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	poverty	 ha 	 s 	 	 decline 	 d 	 	from	43	percent	of	the	world	's	population	in	1990	to	33	percent	by	2000	and	then	to	21	percent	by	2010	.
give	it	up	for	that	.
 halv 	 ed 	 	.	 halv 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	the	rate	is	still	too	high	--	still	too	 man 	 y 	 	people	 un 	 necess 	 arily 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
there	's	still	work	to	do	.
but	it	's	heart	-	 stop 	 ping 	 	.	it	's	mind	-	 blow 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
and	if	you	live	on	less	than	$	1.25	a	day	,	if	you	live	in	that	kind	of	poverty	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	data	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 every 	 thing 	 	.
if	you	're	a	parent	who	 want 	 s 	 	the	best	for	your	 kid 	 s 	 	--	and	i	am	--	 th 	 is 	 	rapid	 transit 	 ion 	 	is	a	route	out	of	despair	and	 in 	 to 	 	hope	.
and	guess	what	?	if	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	,	look	where	the	amount	of	people	living	on	$	1.25	a	day	 get 	 s 	 	to	by	2030	.
ca	n't	be	true	,	can	it	?
that	's	what	the	data	is	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	.	if	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	,	we	get	to	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	the	zero	zone	.
for	number	-	crunchers	like	us	,	that	is	the	 ero 	 genous 	 	zone	,	and	it	's	fair	to	say	that	i	am	,	by	now	,	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 arouse 	 d 	 	by	the	 coll 	 ating 	 	of	data	.
so	virtual	 elimi 	 nation 	 	of	 extrem 	 e 	 	poverty	,	 a 	 s 	 	defined	by	people	living	on	less	than	$	1.25	a	day	,	 adjust 	 ed 	 	,	of	course	,	for	 infla 	 tion 	 	from	a	1990	 base 	 line 	 	.
we	do	love	a	good	 base 	 line 	 	.
that	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
now	i	know	that	some	of	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	progress	is	all	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	or	latin	america	or	model	 count 	 ries 	 	like	brazil	--	and	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	love	a	brazilian	model	?	--	but	look	at	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
there	's	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	10	 count 	 ries 	 	,	some	call	them	the	 lion 	 s 	 	,	who	in	the	last	decade	have	had	a	combination	of	100	percent	debt	 can 	 cell 	 ation 	 	,	a	 trip 	 ling 	 	of	aid	,	a	 ten 	 fold 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	in	fdi	--	that	's	foreign	direct	 invest 	 ment 	 	--	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 un 	 lock 	 ed 	 	a	 quad 	 rup 	 ling 	 	of	domestic	 resource 	 s 	 	--	that	's	local	money	--	which	,	when	 s 	 pent 	 	 wise 	 ly 	 	--	that	's	good	 govern 	 ance 	 	--	cut	 child 	 hood 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	by	a	third	,	 double 	 d 	 	education	 comple 	 tion 	 	rates	,	and	they	,	too	,	 halv 	 ed 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	poverty	,	and	at	 th 	 is 	 	rate	,	these	10	get	to	zero	too	.
so	the	 pri 	 de 	 	of	 lion 	 s 	 	is	the	proof	of	 con 	 cept 	 	.
there	are	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
for	a	start	,	you	wo	n't	have	to	listen	to	an	 in 	 suffer 	 able 	 	little	 jump 	 ed 	 	-	up	jesus	like	 my 	 self 	 	.
how	about	that	?
and	2028	,	2030	?	it	's	just	around	the	corner	.
i	mean	,	it	's	about	three	 roll 	 ing 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	 fare 	 well 	 	 concert 	 s 	 	away	.
i	hope	.	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	.
 make 	 s 	 	us	look	 re 	 ally 	 	young	.
so	why	are	n't	we	 jump 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	is	real	,	but	so	is	the	 jeopard 	 y 	 	.
we	ca	n't	get	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 un 	 til 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	accept	that	we	can	get	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	graph	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 in 	 ertia 	 	.	it	's	how	we	screw	it	up	.
and	the	next	one	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 moment 	 um 	 	.
and	it	's	how	we	can	bend	the	arc	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	down	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	zero	,	just	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	know	work	.
so	 in 	 ertia 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 moment 	 um 	 	.
there	is	 jeopard 	 y 	 	,	and	of	course	,	the	 close 	 r 	 	you	get	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	.
we	know	the	 obstacle 	 s 	 	that	are	in	our	way	right	now	,	in	difficult	 time 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	 to 	 day 	 	in	your	capital	,	in	difficult	 time 	 s 	 	,	some	who	mind	the	nation	's	 pur 	 s 	 e 	 	want	to	cut	life	-	saving	 program 	 s 	 	like	the	global	fund	.
but	you	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	.
you	can	tell	 politic 	 ians 	 	that	these	 cut 	 s 	 	[	can	cost	]	 live 	 s 	 	.
right	now	 to 	 day 	 	,	in	oslo	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	oil	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 fight 	 ing 	 	to	keep	secret	 the 	 ir 	 	 payment 	 s 	 	to	 government 	 s 	 	for	 ex 	 tract 	 ing 	 	oil	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
you	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	too	.
you	can	join	the	one	campaign	,	and	 lead 	 ers 	 	like	mo	ibrahim	,	the	 tele 	 com 	 	entrepreneur	.
we	're	 push 	 ing 	 	for	 law 	 s 	 	that	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	at	 l 	 east 	 	some	of	the	wealth	under	the	ground	 end 	 s 	 	up	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	the	people	living	above	it	.
and	right	now	,	we	know	that	the	 big 	 gest 	 	disease	of	all	is	not	a	disease	.	it	's	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
but	there	's	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	for	that	too	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	open	data	 set 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	the	ted	community	is	 re 	 ally 	 	on	it	.
 day 	 light 	 	,	you	could	call	it	,	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	.
and	technology	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 turbo 	 charging 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	to	hide	if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	bad	stuff	.
so	let	me	tell	you	about	the	u	-	report	,	which	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	.	it	's	150,000	 millennia 	 l 	 s 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	uganda	,	young	people	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	2g	 phone 	 s 	 	,	an	sms	social	network	 ex 	 posing 	 	government	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	and	 demand 	 ing 	 	to	know	what	's	in	the	budget	and	how	 the 	 ir 	 	money	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 excit 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
look	,	once	you	have	these	 tool 	 s 	 	,	you	ca	n't	not	use	them	.
once	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	,	you	ca	n't	un	-	know	it	.
you	ca	n't	delete	 th 	 is 	 	data	from	your	brain	,	but	you	can	delete	the	 cliche 	 d 	 	image	of	 suppli 	 cant 	 	,	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	 people 	 s 	 	not	taking	control	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 live 	 s 	 	.
you	can	 er 	 ase 	 	that	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	can	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	true	 any 	 more 	 	.
it	's	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	.
2030	?	by	2030	,	 robot 	 s 	 	,	not	just	 serv 	 ing 	 	us	guinness	,	but	 drink 	 ing 	 	it	.
by	the	time	we	get	there	,	every	place	with	a	rough	semblance	of	 govern 	 ance 	 	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	on	 the 	 ir 	 	way	.
so	i	'm	here	to	--	i	guess	we	're	here	to	try	and	infect	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	virtuous	,	data	-	based	virus	,	the	one	we	call	 fact 	 ivism 	 	.
it	's	not	going	to	kill	you	.
in	fact	,	it	could	 s 	 ave 	 	 count 	 less 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
i	guess	we	in	the	one	campaign	would	love	you	to	be	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	,	spread	it	,	share	it	,	pass	it	on	.
by	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	you	will	join	us	and	 count 	 less 	 	 other 	 s 	 	in	what	i	 tru 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	is	the	 great 	 est 	 	adventure	ever	taken	,	the	ever	-	 demand 	 ing 	 	journey	of	 e 	 quality 	 	.
could	we	 re 	 ally 	 	be	the	great	generation	that	mandela	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	be	?
might	we	answer	that	 clar 	 ion 	 	call	with	science	,	with	reason	,	with	 fact 	 s 	 	,	and	,	 da 	 re 	 	i	say	it	,	 emotion 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	is	obvious	,	 f 	 activist 	 s 	 	have	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	too	.
i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	of	wael	ghonim	,	 th 	 ough 	 	.
some	of	you	know	him	.	he	set	up	one	of	the	facebook	 group 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	tahrir	square	in	cairo	.
he	got	 throw 	 n 	 	in	jail	for	it	,	but	i	have	his	 word 	 s 	 	 tattoo 	 ed 	 	on	my	brain	.
``	we	are	going	to	win	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	understand	 politic 	 s 	 	.
