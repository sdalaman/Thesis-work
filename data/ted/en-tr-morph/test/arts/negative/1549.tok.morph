i	've	got	a	great	idea	that	's	going	to	change	the	world	.
it	's	fantastic	,	it	's	going	to	blow	your	mind	.
it	's	my	 beaut 	 iful 	 	baby	.
here	's	the	thing	,	 every 	 body 	 	 love 	 s 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	baby	.
i	mean	,	i	was	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	baby	.
here	's	me	and	my	dad	a	couple	 day 	 s 	 	after	i	was	born	.
so	in	the	world	of	product	design	,	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	baby	's	like	the	 con 	 cept 	 	car	.
it	's	the	knock	-	out	.
you	see	it	and	you	go	,	``	oh	,	my	god	.	i	'd	buy	that	in	a	second	!	``
so	why	is	it	that	 th 	 is 	 	year	's	new	 car 	 s 	 	look	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	last	year	's	new	 car 	 s 	 	?
what	went	wrong	between	the	design	studio	and	the	 factor 	 y 	 	?
 to 	 day 	 	i	do	n't	want	to	talk	about	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	i	want	to	talk	about	the	awkward	adolescence	of	design	--	 t 	 hose 	 	sort	of	 do 	 rky 	 	 teen 	 age 	 	 year 	 s 	 	where	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	the	world	 work 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	start	with	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	some	work	that	we	did	on	 new 	 born 	 	health	.
so	here	's	a	problem	:	four	million	 bab 	 ies 	 	around	the	world	,	 most 	 ly 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	die	every	year	before	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 birth 	 day 	 	,	even	before	 the 	 ir 	 	first	month	of	life	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	half	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	or	about	1.8	million	 new 	 born 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	would	make	it	if	you	could	just	keep	them	warm	for	the	first	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	first	week	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 new 	 born 	 	intensive	care	unit	in	kathmandu	,	nepal	.
all	of	these	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 blank 	 et 	 s 	 	belong	in	 incub 	 ators 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 don 	 ated 	 	japanese	atom	 incub 	 ator 	 	that	we	found	in	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	in	kathmandu	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	want	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	a	hospital	in	japan	 up 	 grad 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	and	 don 	 ated 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	old	stuff	to	nepal	.
the	problem	is	,	 with 	 out 	 	 technician 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	spare	 part 	 s 	 	,	 don 	 ations 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	turn	 in 	 to 	 	junk	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	a	problem	that	we	could	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	.
 keep 	 ing 	 	a	baby	warm	for	a	week	,	that	's	not	rocket	science	.
so	we	got	 start 	 ed 	 	.
we	 partner 	 ed 	 	with	a	 lead 	 ing 	 	medical	research	institution	here	in	boston	.
we	 conduct 	 ed 	 	 month 	 s 	 	of	user	research	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	think	like	 design 	 ers 	 	,	human	-	 center 	 ed 	 	design	.
let	's	figure	out	what	people	want	.
we	 kill 	 ed 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	post	-	it	 note 	 s 	 	.
we	made	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 prototype 	 s 	 	to	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 neo 	 nurture 	 	infant	 incub 	 ator 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 smart 	 s 	 	built	 in 	 to 	 	it	.	and	we	felt	great	.
so	the	idea	here	is	,	 un 	 like 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	car	,	we	want	to	marry	 some 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	our	idea	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	design	would	inspire	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	and	other	people	of	influence	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	model	and	run	with	it	.
here	's	the	bad	news	:	the	 on 	 ly 	 	baby	ever	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	 in 	 side 	 	the	 neo 	 nurture 	 	 incub 	 ator 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	kid	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	time	magazine	photo	shoot	.
so	 re 	 cognition 	 	is	fantastic	.
we	want	design	to	get	out	for	people	to	see	it	.
it	won	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
but	it	felt	like	a	 boo 	 by 	 	prize	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	and	i	do	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	kid	was	even	in	it	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	get	warm	.
so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	design	for	inspiration	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	--	i	guess	what	i	would	say	is	,	for	us	,	for	what	i	want	to	do	,	it	's	either	too	 s 	 low 	 	or	it	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	it	's	 in 	 effective 	 	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	i	want	to	design	for	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	to	make	 beaut 	 iful 	 	stuff	.
i	want	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	.
so	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	 neo 	 nurture 	 	,	we	paid	a	lot	of	attention	to	the	people	who	are	going	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	thing	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	poor	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	 r 	 ural 	 	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 over 	 load 	 ed 	 	 nurse 	 s 	 	,	even	repair	 technician 	 s 	 	.
we	thought	we	had	all	our	 base 	 s 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	,	we	'd	 d 	 one 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	right	.
well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ation 	 	of	people	who	have	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	a	product	for	it	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	:	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	,	 fin 	 anc 	 ing 	 	,	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	 regulat 	 ion 	 	.
michael	free	at	path	 say 	 s 	 	you	have	to	figure	out	who	will	``	 choos 	 e 	 	,	use	and	pay	the	 due 	 s 	 	``	for	a	product	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	have	to	ask	the	question	--	vc	's	 al 	 ways 	 	ask	,	``	 s 	 ir 	 	,	what	is	your	business	,	and	who	is	your	 custom 	 er 	 	?	``
who	is	our	 custom 	 er 	 	?	well	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bangladeshi	hospital	director	 out 	 side 	 	his	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	buy	any	of	his	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	are	made	by	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	health	or	by	foreign	 donor 	 s 	 	,	and	it	just	kind	of	 show 	 s 	 	up	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	here	's	a	 multi 	 national 	 	medical	 de 	 vice 	 	 manufactur 	 er 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	they	've	got	to	fish	where	the	fish	are	.
so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	in	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 market 	 s 	 	,	where	the	fish	are	,	are	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	middle	class	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	--	 disease 	 s 	 	of	 af 	 flu 	 ence 	 	:	heart	disease	,	 in 	 fertil 	 ity 	 	.
so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	design	for	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	in	one	 a 	 spect 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	design	for	 manufactur 	 e 	 	and	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	that	was	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 	.
second	,	we	took	that	 less 	 on 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	push	it	 in 	 to 	 	our	next	project	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	by	 find 	 ing 	 	a	 manufactur 	 er 	 	,	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	mtts	in	vietnam	,	that	 manufactur 	 es 	 	 new 	 born 	 	care	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 south 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
our	other	partner	is	east	 meet 	 s 	 	west	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	american	 found 	 ation 	 	that	 distribut 	 es 	 	that	technology	to	poor	 hospital 	 s 	 	around	that	region	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	them	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	what	do	you	want	?
what	's	a	problem	you	want	to	solve	?	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	let	's	work	on	 new 	 born 	 	jaundice	.	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	these	mind	-	boggling	global	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	jaundice	 affect 	 s 	 	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	 new 	 born 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
of	 t 	 hose 	 	 new 	 born 	 s 	 	,	one	in	10	 rough 	 ly 	 	,	if	it	's	not	 treat 	 ed 	 	,	the	jaundice	 get 	 s 	 	so	severe	that	it	 lead 	 s 	 	to	either	a	life	-	long	 dis 	 ability 	 	,	or	the	 kid 	 s 	 	could	even	die	.
there	's	one	way	to	treat	jaundice	,	and	that	's	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	an	 ex 	 change 	 	 trans 	 fusion 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	that	's	expensive	and	a	little	bit	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
there	is	 an 	 other 	 	cure	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	,	a	little	 daunt 	 ing 	 	.
you	've	got	to	shine	blue	light	on	the	kid	--	bright	blue	light	on	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	the	skin	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	cover	.
how	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	hard	problem	?
so	i	went	to	mit	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	'll	figure	that	out	.
so	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 over 	 head 	 	 photo 	 therapy 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	that	's	designed	for	american	 hospital 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	how	it	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	used	.
so	it	's	over	the	baby	,	 illumi 	 nating 	 	a	single	patient	.
take	it	out	of	an	american	hospital	,	 s 	 end 	 	it	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	to	a	 crowd 	 ed 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	here	's	how	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	.
the	 effective 	 ness 	 	of	 photo 	 therapy 	 	is	a	function	of	light	 intens 	 ity 	 	.
so	these	dark	blue	 square 	 s 	 	show	you	where	it	's	effective	 photo 	 therapy 	 	.
here	's	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	under	actual	use	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	on	the	 edge 	 s 	 	are	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 receiv 	 ing 	 	effective	 photo 	 therapy 	 	.
but	 with 	 out 	 	training	,	 with 	 out 	 	some	kind	of	light	meter	,	how	would	you	know	?
we	see	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	here	's	a	 neo 	 natal 	 	intensive	care	unit	where	 mom 	 s 	 	come	in	to	visit	 the 	 ir 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
and	keep	in	mind	,	mom	 may 	 be 	 	just	had	a	c	-	section	,	so	that	's	 al 	 ready 	 	kind	of	a	 bum 	 mer 	 	.
mom	's	 visit 	 ing 	 	her	kid	.
she	 s 	 ees 	 	her	baby	naked	,	 ly 	 ing 	 	under	some	blue	 light 	 s 	 	,	looking	kind	of	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
it	's	not	 un 	 common 	 	for	mom	to	put	a	 blank 	 et 	 	over	the	baby	.
from	a	 photo 	 therapy 	 	 stand 	 point 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	not	the	best	behavior	.
in	fact	that	 sound 	 s 	 	kind	of	dumb	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	what	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	dumb	user	--	 re 	 ally 	 	is	what	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	dumb	 product 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	think	like	 existential 	 ists 	 	.
it	's	not	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	we	would	have	 paint 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	the	use	--	designed	for	actual	use	.
how	are	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	?
so	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	when	we	think	about	our	partner	mtts	,	they	've	made	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 treat 	 ing 	 	 new 	 born 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	.
so	here	's	an	 over 	 head 	 	 warm 	 er 	 	and	a	cpap	.
they	're	 in 	 expensive 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 rug 	 ged 	 	.
they	've	 treat 	 ed 	 	50,000	 kid 	 s 	 	in	vietnam	with	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
but	here	's	the	problem	:	every	doctor	in	the	world	,	every	hospital	 administr 	 ator 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	tv	--	curse	 t 	 hose 	 	``	e.r.	``	 re 	 run 	 s 	 	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	they	all	know	what	a	medical	 de 	 vice 	 	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	look	like	.
they	want	buck	rogers	,	they	do	n't	want	effective	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	crazy	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	dumb	,	but	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hospital 	 s 	 	who	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	have	no	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	than	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	cheap	and	crummy	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	if	we	want	people	to	trust	a	 de 	 vice 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	look	 trust 	 worthy 	 	.
so	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	 appear 	 ance 	 s 	 	matter	.
so	we	took	all	that	information	together	.
we	 tri 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	to	get	it	right	.
and	here	's	what	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 fire 	 fly 	 	 photo 	 therapy 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	we	did	n't	stop	at	the	 con 	 cept 	 	car	.
so	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	.
our	goal	is	to	make	a	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	product	that	our	partner	mtts	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 manufactur 	 e 	 	.
so	our	goal	is	to	 stud 	 y 	 	how	they	work	,	the	 resource 	 s 	 	they	have	access	to	,	so	that	they	can	make	 th 	 is 	 	product	.
so	that	's	the	design	for	 manufactur 	 e 	 	question	.
when	we	think	about	actual	use	,	you	'll	notice	that	 fire 	 fly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	single	 bas 	 s 	 inet 	 	.
it	 on 	 ly 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	a	single	baby	.
and	the	idea	here	is	it	's	obvious	how	you	ought	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
if	you	try	to	put	more	than	one	kid	in	,	you	're	 stack 	 ing 	 	them	on	top	of	each	other	.
so	the	idea	here	is	we	say	,	you	want	to	make	it	hard	to	use	wrong	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	you	want	to	make	the	right	way	to	use	it	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	way	to	use	it	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	mom	.
 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	mom	 think 	 s 	 	her	baby	 look 	 s 	 	cold	,	 want 	 s 	 	to	put	a	 blank 	 et 	 	over	the	baby	.
well	that	's	why	we	have	 light 	 s 	 	above	and	 be 	 low 	 	the	baby	in	 fire 	 fly 	 	.
so	if	mom	 do 	 es 	 	put	a	 blank 	 et 	 	over	the	baby	,	it	's	still	 receiv 	 ing 	 	effective	 photo 	 therapy 	 	from	 be 	 low 	 	.
last	story	here	:	i	've	got	a	friend	in	india	who	told	me	that	you	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	tested	a	piece	of	 electron 	 ic 	 	technology	for	 distribut 	 ion 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	 un 	 til 	 	you	've	trained	a	 cock 	 roach 	 	to	climb	in	and	 pe 	 e 	 	on	every	single	little	component	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
you	think	it	's	funny	.
i	had	a	 lap 	 top 	 	in	the	peace	 corp 	 s 	 	,	and	the	screen	had	all	these	dead	 pixel 	 s 	 	on	it	.
and	one	day	i	 look 	 ed 	 	in	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	dead	ants	that	had	gotten	 in 	 to 	 	my	 lap 	 top 	 	and	 perish 	 ed 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	poor	ants	!
so	with	 fire 	 fly 	 	,	what	we	did	is	--	the	problem	is	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	get	hot	and	you	have	to	put	in	 vent 	 s 	 	or	 fan 	 s 	 	to	keep	them	cool	--	in	most	 product 	 s 	 	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	ca	n't	put	a	``	do	not	enter	``	sign	next	to	the	vent	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	rid	of	all	of	that	stuff	.
so	 fire 	 fly 	 	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 seal 	 ed 	 	.
these	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	awkward	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	to	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 goof 	 y 	 	teenager	,	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	to	be	a	 frust 	 rated 	 	 design 	 er 	 	.
so	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	do	is	change	the	world	.
i	have	to	pay	attention	to	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	and	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
i	have	to	pay	attention	to	how	people	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	use	a	 de 	 vice 	 	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	pay	attention	.	 re 	 ally 	 	,	there	's	no	excuse	for	failure	.
i	have	to	think	like	an	 existential 	 ist 	 	.
i	have	to	accept	that	there	are	no	dumb	 user 	 s 	 	,	that	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	dumb	 product 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	hard	 question 	 s 	 	.
are	we	 design 	 ing 	 	for	the	world	that	we	want	?
are	we	 design 	 ing 	 	for	the	world	that	we	have	?
are	we	 design 	 ing 	 	for	the	world	that	's	coming	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	ready	or	not	?
i	got	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	business	 design 	 ing 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
i	've	since	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	world	,	you	have	to	design	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	design	that	 matter 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
