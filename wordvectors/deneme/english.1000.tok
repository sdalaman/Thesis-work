Shea	Hembrey	:	How	I	became	100	artists
I	'm	a	contemporary	artist	with	a	bit	of	an	unexpected	background	.
I	was	in	my	20s	before	I	ever	went	to	an	art	museum	.
I	grew	up	in	the	middle	of	nowhere	on	a	dirt	road	in	rural	Arkansas	,	an	hour	from	the	nearest	movie	theater	.
And	I	think	it	was	a	great	place	to	grow	up	as	an	artist	because	I	grew	up	around	quirky	,	colorful	characters	who	were	great	at	making	with	their	hands	.
And	my	childhood	is	more	hick	than	I	could	ever	possibly	relate	to	you	,	and	also	more	intellectual	than	you	would	ever	expect	.
For	instance	,	me	and	my	sister	,	when	we	were	little	,	we	would	compete	to	see	who	could	eat	the	most	squirrel	brains	.
But	on	the	other	side	of	that	,	though	,	we	were	big	readers	in	our	house	.
And	if	the	TV	was	on	,	we	were	watching	a	documentary	.
And	my	dad	is	the	most	voracious	reader	I	know	.
He	can	read	a	novel	or	two	a	day	.
But	when	I	was	little	,	I	remember	,	he	would	kill	flies	in	our	house	with	my	BB	gun	.
And	what	was	so	amazing	to	me	about	that	--	well	he	would	be	in	his	recliner	,	would	holler	for	me	to	fetch	the	BB	gun	,	and	I	'd	go	get	it	.
And	what	was	amazing	to	me	--	well	it	was	pretty	kickass	;	he	was	killing	a	fly	in	the	house	with	a	gun	--	but	what	was	so	amazing	to	me	was	that	he	knew	just	enough	how	to	pump	it	.
And	he	could	shoot	it	from	two	rooms	away	and	not	damage	what	it	was	on	because	he	knew	how	to	pump	it	just	enough	to	kill	the	fly	and	not	damage	what	it	landed	on	.
So	I	should	talk	about	art	.
Or	we	'll	be	here	all	day	with	my	childhood	stories	.
I	love	contemporary	art	,	but	I	'm	often	really	frustrated	with	the	contemporary	art	world	and	the	contemporary	art	scene	.
A	few	years	ago	,	I	spent	months	in	Europe	to	see	the	major	international	art	exhibitions	that	have	the	pulse	of	what	is	supposed	to	be	going	on	in	the	art	world	.
And	I	was	struck	by	going	to	so	many	,	one	after	the	other	,	with	some	clarity	of	what	it	was	that	I	was	longing	for	.
And	I	was	longing	for	several	things	that	I	was	n't	getting	,	or	not	getting	enough	of	.
But	two	of	the	main	things	:	one	of	it	,	I	was	longing	for	more	work	that	was	appealing	to	a	broad	public	,	that	was	accessible	.
And	the	second	thing	that	I	was	longing	for	was	some	more	exquisite	craftsmanship	and	technique	.
So	I	started	thinking	and	listing	what	all	it	was	that	I	thought	would	make	a	perfect	biennial	.
So	I	decided	,	I	'm	going	to	start	my	own	biennial	.
I	'm	going	to	organize	it	and	direct	it	and	get	it	going	in	the	world	.
So	I	thought	,	okay	,	I	have	to	have	some	criteria	of	how	to	choose	work	.
So	amongst	all	the	criteria	I	have	,	there	's	two	main	things	.
One	of	them	,	I	call	my	Mimaw	's	Test	.
And	what	that	is	is	I	imagine	explaining	a	work	of	art	to	my	grandmother	in	five	minutes	,	and	if	I	ca	n't	explain	it	in	five	minutes	,	then	it	's	too	obtuse	or	esoteric	and	it	has	n't	been	refined	enough	yet	.
It	needs	to	worked	on	until	it	can	speak	fluently	.
And	then	my	other	second	set	of	rules	--	I	hate	to	say	``	rules	''	because	it	's	art	--	my	criteria	would	be	the	three	H	's	,	which	is	head	,	heart	and	hands	.
And	great	art	would	have	``	head	''	:	it	would	have	interesting	intellectual	ideas	and	concepts	.
It	would	have	``	heart	''	in	that	it	would	have	passion	and	heart	and	soul	.
And	it	would	have	``	hand	''	in	that	it	would	be	greatly	crafted	.
So	I	started	thinking	about	how	am	I	going	to	do	this	biennial	,	how	am	I	going	to	travel	the	world	and	find	these	artists	?
And	then	I	realized	one	day	,	there	's	an	easier	solution	to	this	.
I	'm	just	going	to	make	the	whole	thing	myself	.
And	so	this	is	what	I	did	.
So	I	thought	,	a	biennial	needs	artists	.
I	'm	going	to	do	an	international	biennial	;	I	need	artists	from	all	around	the	world	.
So	what	I	did	was	I	invented	a	hundred	artists	from	around	the	world	.
I	figured	out	their	bios	,	their	passions	in	life	and	their	art	styles	,	and	I	started	making	their	work	.
I	felt	,	oh	this	is	the	kind	of	project	that	I	could	spend	my	whole	life	doing	.
So	I	decided	,	I	'm	going	to	make	this	a	real	biennial	.
It	's	going	to	be	two	years	of	studio	work	.
And	I	'm	going	to	create	this	in	two	years	,	and	I	have	.
So	I	should	start	to	talk	about	these	guys	.
Well	the	range	is	quite	a	bit	.
And	I	'm	such	a	technician	,	so	I	loved	this	project	,	getting	to	play	with	all	the	techniques	.
So	for	example	,	in	realist	paintings	,	it	ranges	from	this	,	which	is	kind	of	old	masters	style	,	to	really	realistic	still-life	,	to	this	type	of	painting	where	I	'm	painting	with	a	single	hair	.
And	then	at	the	other	end	,	there	's	performance	and	short	films	and	indoor	installations	like	this	indoor	installation	and	this	one	,	and	outdoor	installations	like	this	one	and	this	one	.
I	know	I	should	mention	:	I	'm	making	all	these	things	.
This	is	n't	Photoshopped	.
I	'm	under	the	river	with	those	fish	.
So	now	let	me	introduce	some	of	my	fictional	artists	to	you	.
This	is	Nell	Remmel	.
Nell	is	interested	in	agricultural	processes	,	and	her	work	is	based	in	these	practices	.
This	piece	,	which	is	called	``	Flipped	Earth	''	--	she	was	interested	in	taking	the	sky	and	using	it	to	cleanse	barren	ground	.
And	by	taking	giant	mirrors	--	and	here	she	's	taking	giant	mirrors	and	pulling	them	into	the	dirt	.
And	this	is	22	feet	long	.
And	what	I	loved	about	her	work	is	,	when	I	would	walk	around	it	and	look	down	into	the	sky	,	looking	down	to	watch	the	sky	,	and	it	unfolded	in	a	new	way	.
And	probably	the	best	part	of	this	piece	is	at	dusk	and	dawn	when	the	twilight	wedge	has	fallen	and	the	ground	's	dark	,	but	there	's	still	the	light	above	,	bright	above	.
And	so	you	're	standing	there	and	everything	else	is	dark	,	but	there	's	this	portal	that	you	want	to	jump	in	.
This	piece	was	great	.	This	is	in	my	parents	'	backyard	in	Arkansas	.
And	I	love	to	dig	a	hole	.
So	this	piece	was	great	fun	because	it	was	two	days	of	digging	in	soft	dirt	.
The	next	artist	is	Kay	Overstry	,	and	she	's	interested	in	ephemerality	and	transience	.
And	in	her	most	recent	project	,	it	's	called	``	Weather	I	Made	.	''
And	she	's	making	weather	on	her	body	's	scale	.
And	this	piece	is	``	Frost	.	''
And	what	she	did	was	she	went	out	on	a	cold	,	dry	night	and	breathed	back	and	forth	on	the	lawn	to	leave	--	to	leave	her	life	's	mark	,	the	mark	of	her	life	.
And	so	this	is	five-foot	,	five-inches	of	frost	that	she	left	behind	.
The	sun	rises	,	and	it	melts	away	.
And	that	was	played	by	my	mom	.
So	the	next	artist	,	this	is	a	group	of	Japanese	artists	,	a	collective	of	Japanese	artists	--	in	Tokyo	.
And	they	were	interested	in	developing	a	new	,	alternative	art	space	,	and	they	needed	funding	for	it	,	so	they	decided	to	come	up	with	some	interesting	fundraising	projects	.
One	of	these	is	scratch-off	masterpieces	.
And	so	what	they	're	doing	--	each	of	these	artists	on	a	nine-by-seven-inch	card	,	which	they	sell	for	10	bucks	,	they	drew	original	works	of	art	.
And	you	buy	one	,	and	maybe	you	get	a	real	piece	,	and	maybe	not	.
Well	this	has	sparked	a	craze	in	Japan	,	because	everyone	's	wanting	a	masterpiece	.
And	the	ones	that	are	the	most	sought	after	are	the	ones	that	are	only	barely	scratched	off	.
And	all	these	works	,	in	some	way	,	talk	about	luck	or	fate	or	chance	.
Those	first	two	are	portraits	of	mega-jackpot	winners	years	before	and	after	their	win	.
And	in	this	one	it	's	called	``	Drawing	the	Short	Stick	.	''
I	love	this	piece	because	I	have	a	little	cousin	at	home	who	introduced	me	--	which	I	think	is	such	a	great	introduction	--	to	a	friend	one	day	as	,	``	This	is	my	cousin	Shea	.
He	draws	sticks	real	good	.	''
Which	is	one	of	the	best	compliments	ever	.
This	artist	is	Gus	Weinmueller	,	and	he	's	doing	a	project	,	a	large	project	,	called	``	Art	for	the	Peoples	.	''
And	within	this	project	,	he	's	doing	a	smaller	project	called	``	Artists	in	Residence	.	''
And	what	he	does	is	--	he	spends	a	week	at	a	time	with	a	family	.
And	he	shows	up	on	their	porch	,	their	doorstep	,	with	a	toothbrush	and	pajamas	,	and	he	's	ready	to	spend	the	week	with	them	.
And	using	only	what	's	present	,	he	goes	in	and	makes	a	little	abode	studio	to	work	out	of	.
And	he	spends	that	week	talking	to	the	family	about	what	do	they	think	great	art	is	.
He	has	all	these	discussions	with	their	family	,	and	he	digs	through	everything	they	have	,	and	he	finds	materials	to	make	work	.
And	he	makes	a	work	that	answers	what	they	think	great	art	is	.
For	this	family	,	he	made	this	still-life	painting	.
And	whatever	he	makes	somehow	references	nesting	and	space	and	personal	property	.
This	next	project	,	this	is	by	Jaochim	Parisvega	,	and	he	's	interested	in	--	he	believes	art	is	everywhere	waiting	--	that	it	just	needs	a	little	bit	of	a	push	to	happen	.
And	he	provides	this	push	by	harnessing	natural	forces	,	like	in	his	series	where	he	used	rain	to	make	paintings	.
This	project	is	called	``	Love	Nests	.	''
What	he	did	was	to	get	wild	birds	to	make	his	art	for	him	.
So	he	put	the	material	in	places	where	the	birds	were	going	to	collect	them	,	and	they	crafted	his	nests	for	him	.
And	this	one	's	called	``	Lovelock	's	Nest	.	''
This	one	's	called	``	Mixtape	Love	Song	's	Nest	.	''
And	this	one	's	called	``	Lovemaking	Nest	.	''
Next	is	Sylvia	Slater	.
Sylvia	's	interested	in	art	training	.
She	's	a	very	serious	Swiss	artist	.
And	she	was	thinking	about	her	friends	and	family	who	work	in	chaos-ridden	places	and	developing	countries	,	and	she	was	thinking	,	what	can	I	make	that	would	be	of	value	to	them	,	in	case	something	bad	happens	and	they	have	to	buy	their	way	across	the	border	or	pay	off	a	gunman	?
And	so	she	came	up	with	creating	these	pocket-sized	artworks	that	are	portraits	of	the	person	that	would	carry	them	.
And	you	would	carry	this	around	with	you	,	and	if	everything	went	to	hell	,	you	could	make	payments	and	buy	your	life	.
So	this	life	price	is	for	an	irrigation	non-profit	director	.
So	hopefully	what	happens	is	you	never	use	it	,	and	it	's	an	heirloom	that	you	pass	down	.
And	she	makes	them	so	they	could	either	be	broken	up	into	payments	,	or	they	could	be	like	these	,	which	are	leaves	that	can	be	payments	.
And	so	they	're	valuable	.	This	is	precious	metals	and	gemstones	.
And	this	one	had	to	get	broken	up	.
He	had	to	break	off	a	piece	to	get	out	of	Egypt	recently	.
This	is	by	a	duo	,	Michael	Abernathy	and	Bud	Holland	.
And	they	're	interested	in	creating	culture	,	just	tradition	.
So	what	they	do	is	they	move	into	an	area	and	try	to	establish	a	new	tradition	in	a	small	geographic	area	.
So	this	is	in	Eastern	Tennessee	,	and	what	they	decided	was	that	we	need	a	positive	tradition	that	goes	with	death	.
So	they	came	up	with	``	dig	jigs	.	''
And	a	dig	jig	--	a	dig	jig	is	where	,	for	a	milestone	anniversary	or	a	birthday	,	you	gather	all	your	friends	and	family	together	and	you	dance	on	where	you	're	going	to	be	buried	.
And	we	got	a	lot	of	attention	when	we	did	it	.
I	talked	my	family	into	doing	this	,	and	they	did	n't	know	what	I	was	doing	.
And	I	was	like	,	``	Get	dressed	for	a	funeral	.	We	're	going	to	go	do	some	work	.	''
And	so	we	got	to	the	grave	and	made	this	,	which	was	hilarious	--	the	attention	that	we	got	.
So	what	happens	is	you	dance	on	the	grave	,	and	after	you	've	done	your	dance	,	everyone	toasts	you	and	tells	you	how	great	you	are	.
And	you	in	essence	have	a	funeral	that	you	get	to	be	present	for	.
That	's	my	mom	and	dad	.
This	is	by	Jason	Birdsong	.
He	is	interested	in	how	we	see	as	an	animal	,	how	we	are	interested	in	mimicry	and	camouflage	.
You	know	,	we	look	down	a	dark	alley	or	a	jungle	path	,	trying	to	make	out	a	face	or	a	creature	.
We	just	have	that	natural	way	of	seeing	.
And	he	plays	with	this	idea	.
And	this	piece	:	those	are	n't	actually	leaves	.
They	're	butterfly	specimens	who	have	a	natural	camouflage	.
So	he	pairs	these	up	.
There	's	another	pile	of	leaves	.
Those	are	actually	all	real	butterfly	specimens	.
And	he	pairs	these	up	with	paintings	.
Like	this	is	a	painting	of	a	snake	in	a	box	.
So	you	open	the	box	and	you	think	,	``	Whoa	,	there	's	a	snake	in	there	.	''
But	it	's	actually	a	painting	.
So	he	makes	these	interesting	conversations	about	realism	and	mimicry	and	our	drive	to	be	fooled	by	great	camouflage	.
The	next	artist	is	Hazel	Clausen	.
Hazel	Clausen	is	an	anthropologist	who	took	a	sabbatical	and	decided	,	``	You	know	,	I	would	learn	a	lot	about	culture	if	I	created	a	culture	that	does	n't	exist	from	scratch	.	''
So	that	's	what	she	did	.
She	created	the	Swiss	people	named	the	Uvulites	,	and	they	have	this	distinctive	yodeling	song	that	they	use	the	uvula	for	.
And	also	they	reference	how	the	uvula	--	everything	they	say	is	fallen	because	of	the	forbidden	fruit	.
And	that	's	the	symbol	of	their	culture	.
And	this	is	from	a	documentary	called	``	Sexual	Practices	and	Populations	Control	Among	the	Uvulites	.	''
This	is	a	typical	angora	embroidery	for	them	.
This	is	one	of	their	founders	,	Gert	Schaeffer	.
And	actually	this	is	my	Aunt	Irene	.
It	was	so	funny	having	a	fake	person	who	was	making	fake	things	.
And	I	crack	up	at	this	piece	,	because	when	I	see	it	I	know	that	's	French	angora	and	all	antique	German	ribbons	and	wool	that	I	got	in	a	Nebraska	mill	and	carried	around	for	10	years	and	then	antique	Chinese	skirts	.
The	next	is	a	collective	of	artists	called	the	Silver	Dobermans	,	and	their	motto	is	to	spread	pragmatism	one	person	at	a	time	.
And	they	're	really	interested	in	how	over-coddled	we	've	become	.
So	this	is	one	of	their	comments	on	how	over-coddled	we	've	become	.
And	what	they	've	done	is	they	put	a	warning	sign	on	every	single	barb	on	this	fence	.
And	this	is	called	``	Horse	Sense	Fence	.	''
The	next	artist	is	K.	M.	Yoon	,	a	really	interesting	South	Korean	artist	.
And	he	's	reworking	a	Confucian	art	tradition	of	scholar	stones	.
Next	is	Maynard	Sipes	.
And	I	love	Maynard	Sipes	,	but	he	's	off	in	his	own	world	,	and	,	bless	his	heart	,	he	's	so	paranoid	.
Next	is	Roy	Penig	,	a	really	interesting	Kentucky	artist	,	and	he	's	the	nicest	guy	.
He	even	once	traded	a	work	of	art	for	a	block	of	government	cheese	because	the	person	wanted	it	so	badly	.
Next	is	an	Australian	artist	,	Janeen	Jackson	,	and	this	is	from	a	project	of	hers	called	``	What	an	Artwork	Does	When	We	're	Not	Watching	.	''
Next	is	by	a	Lithuanian	fortune	teller	,	Jurgi	Petrauskas	.
Next	is	Ginger	Cheshire	.
This	is	from	a	short	film	of	hers	called	``	The	Last	Person	.	''
And	that	's	my	cousin	and	my	sister	's	dog	,	Gabby	.
The	next	,	this	is	by	Sam	Sandy	.
He	's	an	Australian	Aboriginal	elder	,	and	he	's	also	an	artist	.
And	this	is	from	a	large	traveling	sculpture	project	that	he	's	doing	.
This	is	from	Estelle	Willoughsby	.
She	heals	with	color	.
And	she	's	one	of	the	most	prolific	of	all	these	hundred	artists	,	even	though	she	's	going	to	be	90	next	year	.
This	is	by	Z.	Zhou	,	and	he	's	interested	in	stasis	.
Next	is	by	Hilda	Singh	,	and	she	's	doing	a	whole	project	called	``	Social	Outfits	.	''
Next	is	by	Vera	Sokolova	.
And	I	have	to	say	,	Vera	kind	of	scares	me	.
You	ca	n't	look	her	directly	in	the	eyes	because	she	's	kind	of	scary	.
And	it	's	good	that	she	's	not	real	;	she	'd	be	mad	that	I	said	that	.
And	she	's	an	optometrist	in	St.	Petersburg	,	and	she	plays	with	optics	.
Next	,	this	is	by	Thomas	Swifton	.
This	is	from	a	short	film	,	``	Adventures	with	Skinny	.	''
And	this	is	by	Cicily	Bennett	,	and	it	's	from	a	series	of	short	films	.
And	after	this	one	,	there	's	77	other	artists	.
And	all	together	with	those	other	77	you	're	not	seeing	,	that	's	my	biennial	.
Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
Thanks	.
Thank	you	.	Thanks	.

Robert	Lang	is	a	pioneer	of	the	newest	kind	of	origami	--	using	math	and	engineering	principles	to	fold	mind-blowingly	intricate	designs	that	are	beautiful	and	,	sometimes	,	very	useful	.

Robert	Lang	folds	way-new	origami
My	talk	is	``	Flapping	Birds	and	Space	Telescopes	.	''
And	you	would	think	that	should	have	nothing	to	do	with	one	another	,	but	I	hope	by	the	end	of	these	18	minutes	,	you	'll	see	a	little	bit	of	a	relation	.
It	ties	to	origami	.	So	let	me	start	.
What	is	origami	?
Most	people	think	they	know	what	origami	is	.	It	's	this	:	flapping	birds	,	toys	,	cootie	catchers	,	that	sort	of	thing	.
And	that	is	what	origami	used	to	be	.
But	it	's	become	something	else	.
It	's	become	an	art	form	,	a	form	of	sculpture	.
The	common	theme	--	what	makes	it	origami	--	is	folding	is	how	we	create	the	form	.
You	know	,	it	's	very	old	.	This	is	a	plate	from	1797	.
It	shows	these	women	playing	with	these	toys	.
If	you	look	close	,	it	's	this	shape	,	called	a	crane	.
Every	Japanese	kid	learns	how	to	fold	that	crane	.
So	this	art	has	been	around	for	hundreds	of	years	,	and	you	would	think	something	that	's	been	around	that	long	--	so	restrictive	,	folding	only	--	everything	that	could	be	done	has	been	done	a	long	time	ago	.
And	that	might	have	been	the	case	.
But	in	the	twentieth	century	,	a	Japanese	folder	named	Yoshizawa	came	along	,	and	he	created	tens	of	thousands	of	new	designs	.
But	even	more	importantly	,	he	created	a	language	,	a	way	we	could	communicate	,	a	code	of	dots	,	dashes	and	arrows	.
Harkening	back	to	Susan	Blackmore	's	talk	,	we	now	have	a	means	of	transmitting	information	with	heredity	and	selection	,	and	we	know	where	that	leads	.
And	where	it	has	led	in	origami	is	to	things	like	this	.
This	is	an	origami	figure	--	one	sheet	,	no	cuts	,	folding	only	,	hundreds	of	folds	.
This	,	too	,	is	origami	,	and	this	shows	where	we	've	gone	in	the	modern	world	.
Naturalism	.	Detail	.
You	can	get	horns	,	antlers	--	even	,	if	you	look	close	,	cloven	hooves	.
And	it	raises	a	question	:	what	changed	?
And	what	changed	is	something	you	might	not	have	expected	in	an	art	,	which	is	math	.
That	is	,	people	applied	mathematical	principles	to	the	art	,	to	discover	the	underlying	laws	.
And	that	leads	to	a	very	powerful	tool	.
The	secret	to	productivity	in	so	many	fields	--	and	in	origami	--	is	letting	dead	people	do	your	work	for	you	.
Because	what	you	can	do	is	take	your	problem	,	and	turn	it	into	a	problem	that	someone	else	has	solved	,	and	use	their	solutions	.
And	I	want	to	tell	you	how	we	did	that	in	origami	.
Origami	revolves	around	crease	patterns	.
The	crease	pattern	shown	here	is	the	underlying	blueprint	for	an	origami	figure	.
And	you	ca	n't	just	draw	them	arbitrarily	.
They	have	to	obey	four	simple	laws	.
And	they	're	very	simple	,	easy	to	understand	.
The	first	law	is	two-colorability	.	You	can	color	any	crease	pattern	with	just	two	colors	without	ever	having	the	same	color	meeting	.
The	directions	of	the	folds	at	any	vertex	--	the	number	of	mountain	folds	,	the	number	of	valley	folds	--	always	differs	by	two	.	Two	more	or	two	less	.
Nothing	else	.
If	you	look	at	the	angles	around	the	fold	,	you	find	that	if	you	number	the	angles	in	a	circle	,	all	the	even-numbered	angles	add	up	to	a	straight	line	,	all	the	odd-numbered	angles	add	up	to	a	straight	line	.
And	if	you	look	at	how	the	layers	stack	,	you	'll	find	that	no	matter	how	you	stack	folds	and	sheets	,	a	sheet	can	never	penetrate	a	fold	.
So	that	's	four	simple	laws	.	That	's	all	you	need	in	origami	.
All	of	origami	comes	from	that	.
And	you	'd	think	,	``	Can	four	simple	laws	give	rise	to	that	kind	of	complexity	?	''
But	indeed	,	the	laws	of	quantum	mechanics	can	be	written	down	on	a	napkin	,	and	yet	they	govern	all	of	chemistry	,	all	of	life	,	all	of	history	.
If	we	obey	these	laws	,	we	can	do	amazing	things	.
So	in	origami	,	to	obey	these	laws	,	we	can	take	simple	patterns	--	like	this	repeating	pattern	of	folds	,	called	textures	--	and	by	itself	it	's	nothing	.
But	if	we	follow	the	laws	of	origami	,	we	can	put	these	patterns	into	another	fold	that	itself	might	be	something	very	,	very	simple	,	but	when	we	put	it	together	,	we	get	something	a	little	different	.
This	fish	,	400	scales	--	again	,	it	is	one	uncut	square	,	only	folding	.
And	if	you	do	n't	want	to	fold	400	scales	,	you	can	back	off	and	just	do	a	few	things	,	and	add	plates	to	the	back	of	a	turtle	,	or	toes	.
Or	you	can	ramp	up	and	go	up	to	50	stars	on	a	flag	,	with	13	stripes	.
And	if	you	want	to	go	really	crazy	,	1,000	scales	on	a	rattlesnake	.
And	this	guy	's	on	display	downstairs	,	so	take	a	look	if	you	get	a	chance	.
The	most	powerful	tools	in	origami	have	related	to	how	we	get	parts	of	creatures	.
And	I	can	put	it	in	this	simple	equation	.
We	take	an	idea	,	combine	it	with	a	square	,	and	you	get	an	origami	figure	.
What	matters	is	what	we	mean	by	those	symbols	.
And	you	might	say	,	``	Can	you	really	be	that	specific	?
I	mean	,	a	stag	beetle	--	it	's	got	two	points	for	jaws	,	it	's	got	antennae	.	Can	you	be	that	specific	in	the	detail	?	''
And	yeah	,	you	really	can	.
So	how	do	we	do	that	?	Well	,	we	break	it	down	into	a	few	smaller	steps	.
So	let	me	stretch	out	that	equation	.
I	start	with	my	idea	.	I	abstract	it	.
What	's	the	most	abstract	form	?	It	's	a	stick	figure	.
And	from	that	stick	figure	,	I	somehow	have	to	get	to	a	folded	shape	that	has	a	part	for	every	bit	of	the	subject	,	a	flap	for	every	leg	.
And	then	once	I	have	that	folded	shape	that	we	call	the	base	,	you	can	make	the	legs	narrower	,	you	can	bend	them	,	you	can	turn	it	into	the	finished	shape	.
Now	the	first	step	,	pretty	easy	.
Take	an	idea	,	draw	a	stick	figure	.
The	last	step	is	not	so	hard	,	but	that	middle	step	--	going	from	the	abstract	description	to	the	folded	shape	--	that	's	hard	.
But	that	's	the	place	where	the	mathematical	ideas	can	get	us	over	the	hump	.
And	I	'm	going	to	show	you	all	how	to	do	that	so	you	can	go	out	of	here	and	fold	something	.
But	we	're	going	to	start	small	.
This	base	has	a	lot	of	flaps	in	it	.
We	're	going	to	learn	how	to	make	one	flap	.
How	would	you	make	a	single	flap	?
Take	a	square	.	Fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	again	,	until	it	gets	long	and	narrow	,	and	then	we	'll	say	at	the	end	of	that	,	that	's	a	flap	.
I	could	use	that	for	a	leg	,	an	arm	,	anything	like	that	.
What	paper	went	into	that	flap	?
Well	,	if	I	unfold	it	and	go	back	to	the	crease	pattern	,	you	can	see	that	the	upper	left	corner	of	that	shape	is	the	paper	that	went	into	the	flap	.
So	that	's	the	flap	,	and	all	the	rest	of	the	paper	's	left	over	.
I	can	use	it	for	something	else	.
Well	,	there	are	other	ways	of	making	a	flap	.
There	are	other	dimensions	for	flaps	.
If	I	make	the	flaps	skinnier	,	I	can	use	a	bit	less	paper	.
If	I	make	the	flap	as	skinny	as	possible	,	I	get	to	the	limit	of	the	minimum	amount	of	paper	needed	.
And	you	can	see	there	,	it	needs	a	quarter-circle	of	paper	to	make	a	flap	.
There	's	other	ways	of	making	flaps	.
If	I	put	the	flap	on	the	edge	,	it	uses	a	half	circle	of	paper	.
And	if	I	make	the	flap	from	the	middle	,	it	uses	a	full	circle	.
So	,	no	matter	how	I	make	a	flap	,	it	needs	some	part	of	a	circular	region	of	paper	.
So	now	we	're	ready	to	scale	up	.
What	if	I	want	to	make	something	that	has	a	lot	of	flaps	?
What	do	I	need	?	I	need	a	lot	of	circles	.
And	in	the	1990s	,	origami	artists	discovered	these	principles	and	realized	we	could	make	arbitrarily	complicated	figures	just	by	packing	circles	.
And	here	's	where	the	dead	people	start	to	help	us	out	,	because	lots	of	people	have	studied	the	problem	of	packing	circles	.
I	can	rely	on	that	vast	history	of	mathematicians	and	artists	looking	at	disc	packings	and	arrangements	.
And	I	can	use	those	patterns	now	to	create	origami	shapes	.
So	we	figured	out	these	rules	whereby	you	pack	circles	,	you	decorate	the	patterns	of	circles	with	lines	according	to	more	rules	.	That	gives	you	the	folds	.
Those	folds	fold	into	a	base	.	You	shape	the	base	.
You	get	a	folded	shape	--	in	this	case	,	a	cockroach	.
And	it	's	so	simple	.
It	's	so	simple	that	a	computer	could	do	it	.
And	you	say	,	``	Well	,	you	know	,	how	simple	is	that	?	''
But	computers	--	you	need	to	be	able	to	describe	things	in	very	basic	terms	,	and	with	this	,	we	could	.
So	I	wrote	a	computer	program	a	bunch	of	years	ago	called	TreeMaker	,	and	you	can	download	it	from	my	website	.
It	's	free	.	It	runs	on	all	the	major	platforms	--	even	Windows	.
And	you	just	draw	a	stick	figure	,	and	it	calculates	the	crease	pattern	.
It	does	the	circle	packing	,	calculates	the	crease	pattern	,	and	if	you	use	that	stick	figure	that	I	just	showed	--	which	you	can	kind	of	tell	,	it	's	a	deer	,	it	's	got	antlers	--	you	'll	get	this	crease	pattern	.
And	if	you	take	this	crease	pattern	,	you	fold	on	the	dotted	lines	,	you	'll	get	a	base	that	you	can	then	shape	into	a	deer	,	with	exactly	the	crease	pattern	that	you	wanted	.
And	if	you	want	a	different	deer	,	not	a	white-tailed	deer	,	but	you	want	a	mule	deer	,	or	an	elk	,	you	change	the	packing	,	and	you	can	do	an	elk	.
Or	you	could	do	a	moose	.
Or	,	really	,	any	other	kind	of	deer	.
These	techniques	revolutionized	this	art	.
We	found	we	could	do	insects	,	spiders	,	which	are	close	,	things	with	legs	,	things	with	legs	and	wings	,	things	with	legs	and	antennae	.
And	if	folding	a	single	praying	mantis	from	a	single	uncut	square	was	n't	interesting	enough	,	then	you	could	do	two	praying	mantises	from	a	single	uncut	square	.
She	's	eating	him	.
I	call	it	``	Snack	Time	.	''
And	you	can	do	more	than	just	insects	.
This	--	you	can	put	details	,	toes	and	claws	.	A	grizzly	bear	has	claws	.
This	tree	frog	has	toes	.
Actually	,	lots	of	people	in	origami	now	put	toes	into	their	models	.
Toes	have	become	an	origami	meme	,	because	everyone	's	doing	it	.
You	can	make	multiple	subjects	.
So	these	are	a	couple	of	instrumentalists	.
The	guitar	player	from	a	single	square	,	the	bass	player	from	a	single	square	.
And	if	you	say	,	``	Well	,	but	the	guitar	,	bass	--	that	's	not	so	hot	.
Do	a	little	more	complicated	instrument	.	''
Well	,	then	you	could	do	an	organ	.
And	what	this	has	allowed	is	the	creation	of	origami-on-demand	.
So	now	people	can	say	,	``	I	want	exactly	this	and	this	and	this	,	''	and	you	can	go	out	and	fold	it	.
And	sometimes	you	create	high	art	,	and	sometimes	you	pay	the	bills	by	doing	some	commercial	work	.
But	I	want	to	show	you	some	examples	.
Everything	you	'll	see	here	,	except	the	car	,	is	origami	.
Just	to	show	you	,	this	really	was	folded	paper	.
Computers	made	things	move	,	but	these	were	all	real	,	folded	objects	that	we	made	.
And	we	can	use	this	not	just	for	visuals	,	but	it	turns	out	to	be	useful	even	in	the	real	world	.
Surprisingly	,	origami	and	the	structures	that	we	've	developed	in	origami	turn	out	to	have	applications	in	medicine	,	in	science	,	in	space	,	in	the	body	,	consumer	electronics	and	more	.
And	I	want	to	show	you	some	of	these	examples	.
One	of	the	earliest	was	this	pattern	,	this	folded	pattern	,	studied	by	Koryo	Miura	,	a	Japanese	engineer	.
He	studied	a	folding	pattern	,	and	realized	this	could	fold	down	into	an	extremely	compact	package	that	had	a	very	simple	opening	and	closing	structure	.
And	he	used	it	to	design	this	solar	array	.
It	's	an	artist	's	rendition	,	but	it	flew	in	a	Japanese	telescope	in	1995	.
Now	,	there	is	actually	a	little	origami	in	the	James	Webb	Space	Telescope	,	but	it	's	very	simple	.
The	telescope	,	going	up	in	space	,	it	unfolds	in	two	places	.
It	folds	in	thirds	.	It	's	a	very	simple	pattern	--	you	would	n't	even	call	that	origami	.
They	certainly	did	n't	need	to	talk	to	origami	artists	.
But	if	you	want	to	go	higher	and	go	larger	than	this	,	then	you	might	need	some	origami	.
Engineers	at	Lawrence	Livermore	National	Lab	had	an	idea	for	a	telescope	much	larger	.
They	called	it	the	Eyeglass	.
The	design	called	for	geosynchronous	orbit	25,000	miles	up	,	100-meter	diameter	lens	.
So	,	imagine	a	lens	the	size	of	a	football	field	.
There	were	two	groups	of	people	who	were	interested	in	this	:	planetary	scientists	,	who	want	to	look	up	,	and	then	other	people	,	who	wanted	to	look	down	.
Whether	you	look	up	or	look	down	,	how	do	you	get	it	up	in	space	?	You	've	got	to	get	it	up	there	in	a	rocket	.
And	rockets	are	small	.	So	you	have	to	make	it	smaller	.
How	do	you	make	a	large	sheet	of	glass	smaller	?
Well	,	about	the	only	way	is	to	fold	it	up	somehow	.
So	you	have	to	do	something	like	this	.
This	was	a	small	model	.
Folded	lens	,	you	divide	up	the	panels	,	you	add	flexures	.
But	this	pattern	's	not	going	to	work	to	get	something	100	meters	down	to	a	few	meters	.
So	the	Livermore	engineers	,	wanting	to	make	use	of	the	work	of	dead	people	,	or	perhaps	live	origamists	,	said	,	``	Let	's	see	if	someone	else	is	doing	this	sort	of	thing	.	''
So	they	looked	into	the	origami	community	,	we	got	in	touch	with	them	,	and	I	started	working	with	them	.
And	we	developed	a	pattern	together	that	scales	to	arbitrarily	large	size	,	but	that	allows	any	flat	ring	or	disc	to	fold	down	into	a	very	neat	,	compact	cylinder	.
And	they	adopted	that	for	their	first	generation	,	which	was	not	100	meters	--	it	was	a	five-meter	.
But	this	is	a	five-meter	telescope	--	has	about	a	quarter-mile	focal	length	.
And	it	works	perfectly	on	its	test	range	,	and	it	indeed	folds	up	into	a	neat	little	bundle	.
Now	,	there	is	other	origami	in	space	.
Japan	Aerospace	[	Exploration	]	Agency	flew	a	solar	sail	,	and	you	can	see	here	that	the	sail	expands	out	,	and	you	can	still	see	the	fold	lines	.
The	problem	that	's	being	solved	here	is	something	that	needs	to	be	big	and	sheet-like	at	its	destination	,	but	needs	to	be	small	for	the	journey	.
And	that	works	whether	you	're	going	into	space	,	or	whether	you	're	just	going	into	a	body	.
And	this	example	is	the	latter	.
This	is	a	heart	stent	developed	by	Zhong	You	at	Oxford	University	.
It	holds	open	a	blocked	artery	when	it	gets	to	its	destination	,	but	it	needs	to	be	much	smaller	for	the	trip	there	,	through	your	blood	vessels	.
And	this	stent	folds	down	using	an	origami	pattern	,	based	on	a	model	called	the	water	bomb	base	.
Airbag	designers	also	have	the	problem	of	getting	flat	sheets	into	a	small	space	.
And	they	want	to	do	their	design	by	simulation	.
So	they	need	to	figure	out	how	,	in	a	computer	,	to	flatten	an	airbag	.
And	the	algorithms	that	we	developed	to	do	insects	turned	out	to	be	the	solution	for	airbags	to	do	their	simulation	.
And	so	they	can	do	a	simulation	like	this	.
Those	are	the	origami	creases	forming	,	and	now	you	can	see	the	airbag	inflate	and	find	out	,	does	it	work	?
And	that	leads	to	a	really	interesting	idea	.
You	know	,	where	did	these	things	come	from	?
Well	,	the	heart	stent	came	from	that	little	blow-up	box	that	you	might	have	learned	in	elementary	school	.
It	's	the	same	pattern	,	called	the	water	bomb	base	.
The	airbag-flattening	algorithm	came	from	all	the	developments	of	circle	packing	and	the	mathematical	theory	that	was	really	developed	just	to	create	insects	--	things	with	legs	.
The	thing	is	,	that	this	often	happens	in	math	and	science	.
When	you	get	math	involved	,	problems	that	you	solve	for	aesthetic	value	only	,	or	to	create	something	beautiful	,	turn	around	and	turn	out	to	have	an	application	in	the	real	world	.
And	as	weird	and	surprising	as	it	may	sound	,	origami	may	someday	even	save	a	life	.
Thanks	.

Stephen	Palumbi	:	Following	the	mercury	trail
It	can	be	a	very	complicated	thing	,	the	ocean	.
And	it	can	be	a	very	complicated	thing	,	what	human	health	is	.
And	bringing	those	two	together	might	seem	a	very	daunting	task	,	but	what	I	'm	going	to	try	to	say	is	that	even	in	that	complexity	,	there	's	some	simple	themes	that	I	think	,	if	we	understand	,	we	can	really	move	forward	.
And	those	simple	themes	are	n't	really	themes	about	the	complex	science	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	things	that	we	all	pretty	well	know	.
And	I	'm	going	to	start	with	this	one	:	If	momma	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	nobody	happy	.
We	know	that	,	right	?	We	've	experienced	that	.
And	if	we	just	take	that	and	we	build	from	there	,	then	we	can	go	to	the	next	step	,	which	is	that	if	the	ocean	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	nobody	happy	.
That	's	the	theme	of	my	talk	.
And	we	're	making	the	ocean	pretty	unhappy	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	.
This	is	a	shot	of	Cannery	Row	in	1932	.
Cannery	Row	,	at	the	time	,	had	the	biggest	industrial	canning	operation	on	the	west	coast	.
We	piled	enormous	amounts	of	pollution	into	the	air	and	into	the	water	.
Rolf	Bolin	,	who	was	a	professor	at	the	Hopkin	's	Marine	Station	where	I	work	,	wrote	in	the	1940s	that	``	The	fumes	from	the	scum	floating	on	the	inlets	of	the	bay	were	so	bad	they	turned	lead-based	paints	black	.	''
People	working	in	these	canneries	could	barely	stay	there	all	day	because	of	the	smell	,	but	you	know	what	they	came	out	saying	?
They	say	,	``	You	know	what	you	smell	?
You	smell	money	.	''
That	pollution	was	money	to	that	community	,	and	those	people	dealt	with	the	pollution	and	absorbed	it	into	their	skin	and	into	their	bodies	because	they	needed	the	money	.
We	made	the	ocean	unhappy	;	we	made	people	very	unhappy	,	and	we	made	them	unhealthy	.
The	connection	between	ocean	health	and	human	health	is	actually	based	upon	another	couple	simple	adages	,	and	I	want	to	call	that	``	pinch	a	minnow	,	hurt	a	whale	.	''
The	pyramid	of	ocean	life	...
Now	,	when	an	ecologist	looks	at	the	ocean	--	I	have	to	tell	you	--	we	look	at	the	ocean	in	a	very	different	way	,	and	we	see	different	things	than	when	a	regular	person	looks	at	the	ocean	because	when	an	ecologist	looks	at	the	ocean	,	we	see	all	those	interconnections	.
We	see	the	base	of	the	food	chain	,	the	plankton	,	the	small	things	,	and	we	see	how	those	animals	are	food	to	animals	in	the	middle	of	the	pyramid	,	and	on	so	up	this	diagram	.
And	that	flow	,	that	flow	of	life	,	from	the	very	base	up	to	the	very	top	,	is	the	flow	that	ecologists	see	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	trying	to	preserve	when	we	say	,	``	Save	the	ocean	.	Heal	the	ocean	.	''
It	's	that	pyramid	.
Now	why	does	that	matter	for	human	health	?
Because	when	we	jam	things	in	the	bottom	of	that	pyramid	that	should	n't	be	there	,	some	very	frightening	things	happen	.
Pollutants	,	some	pollutants	have	been	created	by	us	:	molecules	like	PCBs	that	ca	n't	be	broken	down	by	our	bodies	.
And	they	go	in	the	base	of	that	pyramid	,	and	they	drift	up	;	they	're	passed	up	that	way	,	on	to	predators	and	on	to	the	top	predators	,	and	in	so	doing	,	they	accumulate	.
Now	,	to	bring	that	home	,	I	thought	I	'd	invent	a	little	game	.
We	do	n't	really	have	to	play	it	;	we	can	just	think	about	it	here	.
It	's	the	Styrofoam	and	chocolate	game	.
Imagine	that	when	we	got	on	this	boat	,	we	were	all	given	two	Styrofoam	peanuts	.
Ca	n't	do	much	with	them	:	Put	them	in	your	pocket	.
Suppose	the	rules	are	:	every	time	you	offer	somebody	a	drink	,	you	give	them	the	drink	,	and	you	give	them	your	Styrofoam	peanuts	too	.
What	'll	happen	is	that	the	Styrofoam	peanuts	will	start	moving	through	our	society	here	,	and	they	will	accumulate	in	the	drunkest	,	stingiest	people	.
There	's	no	mechanism	in	this	game	for	them	to	go	anywhere	but	into	a	bigger	and	bigger	pile	of	indigestible	Styrofoam	peanuts	.
And	that	's	exactly	what	happens	with	PDBs	in	this	food	pyramid	:	They	accumulate	into	the	top	of	it	.
Now	suppose	,	instead	of	Styrofoam	peanuts	,	we	take	these	lovely	little	chocolates	that	we	get	and	we	had	those	instead	.
Well	,	some	of	us	would	be	eating	those	chocolates	instead	of	passing	them	around	,	and	instead	of	accumulating	,	they	will	just	pass	into	our	group	here	and	not	accumulate	in	any	one	group	because	they	're	absorbed	by	us	.
And	that	's	the	difference	between	a	PCB	and	,	say	,	something	natural	like	an	omega-3	,	something	we	want	out	of	the	marine	food	chain	.
PCBs	accumulate	.
We	have	great	examples	of	that	,	unfortunately	.
PCBs	accumulate	in	dolphins	in	Sarasota	Bay	,	in	Texas	,	in	North	Carolina	.
They	get	into	the	food	chain	.
The	dolphins	eat	the	fish	that	have	PCBs	from	the	plankton	,	and	those	PCBs	,	being	fat-soluble	,	accumulate	in	these	dolphins	.
Now	,	a	dolphin	,	mother	dolphin	,	any	dolphin	--	there	's	only	one	way	that	a	PCB	can	get	out	of	a	dolphin	.
And	what	's	that	?
In	mother	's	milk	.
Here	's	a	diagram	of	the	PCB	load	of	dolphins	in	Sarasota	Bay	.
Adult	males	:	a	huge	load	.
Juveniles	:	a	huge	load	.
Females	after	their	first	calf	is	already	weaned	:	a	lower	load	.
Those	females	,	they	're	not	trying	to	.
Those	females	are	passing	the	PCBs	in	the	fat	of	their	own	mother	's	milk	into	their	offspring	,	and	their	offspring	do	n't	survive	.
The	death	rate	in	these	dolphins	,	for	the	first	calf	born	of	every	female	dolphin	,	is	60	to	80	percent	.
These	mothers	pump	their	first	offspring	full	of	this	pollutant	,	and	most	of	them	die	.
Now	,	the	mother	then	can	go	and	reproduce	,	but	what	a	terrible	price	to	pay	for	the	accumulation	of	this	pollutant	in	these	animals	--	the	death	of	the	first-born	calf	.
There	's	another	top	predator	in	the	ocean	,	it	turns	out	.
That	top	predator	,	of	course	,	is	us	.
And	we	also	are	eating	meat	that	comes	from	some	of	these	same	places	.
This	is	whale	meat	that	I	photographed	in	a	grocery	store	in	Tokyo	--	or	is	it	?
In	fact	,	what	we	did	a	few	years	ago	was	learn	how	to	smuggle	a	molecular	biology	lab	into	Tokyo	and	use	it	to	genetically	test	the	DNA	out	of	whale	meat	samples	and	identify	what	they	really	were	.
And	some	of	those	whale	meat	samples	were	whale	meat	.
Some	of	them	were	illegal	whale	meat	,	by	the	way	.
That	's	another	story	.
But	some	of	them	were	not	whale	meat	at	all	.
Even	though	they	were	labeled	whale	meat	,	they	were	dolphin	meat	.
Some	of	them	were	dolphin	liver	.	Some	of	them	were	dolphin	blubber	.
And	those	dolphin	parts	had	a	huge	load	of	PCBs	,	dioxins	and	heavy	metals	.
And	that	huge	load	was	passing	into	the	people	that	ate	this	meat	.
It	turns	out	that	a	lot	of	dolphins	are	being	sold	as	meat	in	the	whale	meat	market	around	the	world	.
That	's	a	tragedy	for	those	populations	,	but	it	's	also	a	tragedy	for	the	people	eating	them	because	they	do	n't	know	that	that	's	toxic	meat	.
We	had	these	data	a	few	years	ago	.
I	remember	sitting	at	my	desk	being	about	the	only	person	in	the	world	who	knew	that	whale	meat	being	sold	in	these	markets	was	really	dolphin	meat	,	and	it	was	toxic	.
It	had	two-to-three-to-400	times	the	toxic	loads	ever	allowed	by	the	EPA	.
And	I	remember	there	sitting	at	my	desk	thinking	,	``	Well	,	I	know	this	.	This	is	a	great	scientific	discovery	,	''	but	it	was	so	awful	.
And	for	the	very	first	time	in	my	scientific	career	,	I	broke	scientific	protocol	,	which	is	that	you	take	the	data	and	publish	them	in	scientific	journals	and	then	begin	to	talk	about	them	.
We	sent	a	very	polite	letter	to	the	Minister	of	Health	in	Japan	and	simply	pointed	out	that	this	is	an	intolerable	situation	,	not	for	us	,	but	for	the	people	of	Japan	because	mothers	who	may	be	breastfeeding	,	who	may	have	young	children	,	would	be	buying	something	that	they	thought	was	healthy	,	but	it	was	really	toxic	.
That	led	to	a	whole	series	of	other	campaigns	in	Japan	,	and	I	'm	really	proud	to	say	that	at	this	point	,	it	's	very	difficult	to	buy	anything	in	Japan	that	's	labeled	incorrectly	,	even	though	they	're	still	selling	whale	meat	,	which	I	believe	they	should	n't	.
But	at	least	it	's	labeled	correctly	,	and	you	're	no	longer	going	to	be	buying	toxic	dolphin	meat	instead	.
It	is	n't	just	there	that	this	happens	,	but	in	a	natural	diet	of	some	communities	in	the	Canadian	arctic	and	in	the	United	States	and	in	the	European	arctic	,	a	natural	diet	of	seals	and	whales	leads	to	an	accumulation	of	PCBs	that	have	gathered	up	from	all	parts	of	the	world	and	ended	up	in	these	women	.
These	women	have	toxic	breast	milk	.
They	can	not	feed	their	offspring	,	their	children	,	their	breast	milk	because	of	the	accumulation	of	these	toxins	in	their	food	chain	,	in	their	part	of	the	world	's	ocean	pyramid	.
That	means	their	immune	systems	are	compromised	.
It	means	that	their	children	's	development	can	be	compromised	.
And	the	world	's	attention	on	this	over	the	last	decade	has	reduced	the	problem	for	these	women	,	not	by	changing	the	pyramid	,	but	by	changing	what	they	particularly	eat	out	of	it	.
We	've	taken	them	out	of	their	natural	pyramid	in	order	to	solve	this	problem	.
That	's	a	good	thing	for	this	particular	acute	problem	,	but	it	does	nothing	to	solve	the	pyramid	problem	.
There	's	other	ways	of	breaking	the	pyramid	.
The	pyramid	,	if	we	jam	things	in	the	bottom	,	can	get	backed	up	like	a	sewer	line	that	's	clogged	.
And	if	we	jam	nutrients	,	sewage	,	fertilizer	in	the	base	of	that	food	pyramid	,	it	can	back	up	all	through	it	.
We	end	up	with	things	we	've	heard	about	before	:	red	tides	,	for	example	,	which	are	blooms	of	toxic	algae	floating	through	the	oceans	causing	neurological	damage	.
We	can	also	see	blooms	of	bacteria	,	blooms	of	viruses	in	the	ocean	.
These	are	two	shots	of	a	red	tide	coming	on	shore	here	and	a	bacteria	in	the	genus	vibrio	,	which	includes	the	genus	that	has	cholera	in	it	.
How	many	people	have	seen	a	``	beach	closed	''	sign	?
Why	does	that	happen	?
It	happens	because	we	have	jammed	so	much	into	the	base	of	the	natural	ocean	pyramid	that	these	bacteria	clog	it	up	and	overfill	onto	our	beaches	.
Often	what	jams	us	up	is	sewage	.
Now	how	many	of	you	have	ever	gone	to	a	state	park	or	a	national	park	where	you	had	a	big	sign	at	the	front	saying	,	``	Closed	because	human	sewage	is	so	far	over	this	park	that	you	ca	n't	use	it	''	?
Not	very	often	.	We	would	n't	tolerate	that	.
We	would	n't	tolerate	our	parks	being	swamped	by	human	sewage	,	but	beaches	are	closed	a	lot	in	our	country	.
They	're	closed	more	and	more	and	more	all	around	the	world	for	the	same	reason	,	and	I	believe	we	should	n't	tolerate	that	either	.
It	's	not	just	a	question	of	cleanliness	;	it	's	also	a	question	of	how	those	organisms	then	turn	into	human	disease	.
These	vibrios	,	these	bacteria	,	can	actually	infect	people	.
They	can	go	into	your	skin	and	create	skin	infections	.
This	is	a	graph	from	NOAA	's	ocean	and	human	health	initiative	,	showing	the	rise	of	the	infections	by	vibrio	in	people	over	the	last	few	years	.
Surfers	,	for	example	,	know	this	incredibly	.
And	if	you	can	see	on	some	surfing	sites	,	in	fact	,	not	only	do	you	see	what	the	waves	are	like	or	what	the	weather	's	like	,	but	on	some	surf	rider	sites	,	you	see	a	little	flashing	poo	alert	.
That	means	that	the	beach	might	have	great	waves	,	but	it	's	a	dangerous	place	for	surfers	to	be	because	they	can	carry	with	them	,	even	after	a	great	day	of	surfing	,	this	legacy	of	an	infection	that	might	take	a	very	long	time	to	solve	.
Some	of	these	infections	are	actually	carrying	antibiotic	resistance	genes	now	,	and	that	makes	them	even	more	difficult	.
These	same	infections	create	harmful	algal	blooms	.
Those	blooms	are	generating	other	kinds	of	chemicals	.
This	is	just	a	simple	list	of	some	of	the	types	of	poisons	that	come	out	of	these	harmful	algal	blooms	:	shellfish	poisoning	,	fish	ciguatera	,	diarrheic	shellfish	poisoning	--	you	do	n't	want	to	know	about	that	--	neurotoxic	shellfish	poisoning	,	paralytic	shellfish	poisoning	.
These	are	things	that	are	getting	into	our	food	chain	because	of	these	blooms	.
Rita	Calwell	very	famously	traced	a	very	interesting	story	of	cholera	into	human	communities	,	brought	there	,	not	by	a	normal	human	vector	,	but	by	a	marine	vector	,	this	copepod	.
Copepods	are	small	crustaceans	.
They	're	a	tiny	fraction	of	an	inch	long	,	and	they	can	carry	on	their	little	legs	some	of	the	cholera	bacteria	that	then	leads	to	human	disease	.
That	has	sparked	cholera	epidemics	in	ports	along	the	world	and	has	led	to	increased	concentration	on	trying	to	make	sure	shipping	does	n't	move	these	vectors	of	cholera	around	the	world	.
So	what	do	you	do	?
We	have	major	problems	in	disrupted	ecosystem	flow	that	the	pyramid	may	not	be	working	so	well	,	that	the	flow	from	the	base	up	into	it	is	being	blocked	and	clogged	.
What	do	you	do	when	you	have	this	sort	of	disrupted	flow	?
Well	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	things	you	could	do	.
You	could	call	Joe	the	Plumber	,	for	example	.
And	he	could	come	in	and	fix	the	flow	.
But	in	fact	,	if	you	look	around	the	world	,	not	only	are	there	hope	spots	for	where	we	may	be	able	to	fix	problems	,	there	have	been	places	where	problems	have	been	fixed	,	where	people	have	come	to	grips	with	these	issues	and	begun	to	turn	them	around	.
Monterey	is	one	of	those	.
I	started	out	showing	how	much	we	had	distressed	the	Monterey	Bay	ecosystem	with	pollution	and	the	canning	industry	and	all	of	the	attendant	problems	.
In	1932	,	that	's	the	picture	.
In	2009	,	the	picture	is	dramatically	different	.
The	canneries	are	gone	.	The	pollution	has	abated	.
But	there	's	a	greater	sense	here	that	what	the	individual	communities	need	is	working	ecosystems	.
They	need	a	functioning	pyramid	from	the	base	all	the	way	to	the	top	.
And	that	pyramid	in	Monterey	,	right	now	,	because	of	the	efforts	of	a	lot	of	different	people	,	is	functioning	better	than	it	's	ever	functioned	for	the	last	150	years	.
It	did	n't	happen	accidentally	.
It	happened	because	many	people	put	their	time	and	effort	and	their	pioneering	spirit	into	this	.
On	the	left	there	,	Julia	Platt	,	the	mayor	of	my	little	hometown	in	Pacific	Grove	.
At	74	years	old	,	became	mayor	because	something	had	to	be	done	to	protect	the	ocean	.
In	1931	,	she	produced	California	's	first	community-based	marine	protected	area	,	right	next	to	the	biggest	polluting	cannery	,	because	Julia	knew	that	when	the	canneries	eventually	were	gone	,	the	ocean	needed	a	place	to	grow	from	,	that	the	ocean	needed	a	place	to	spark	a	seed	,	and	she	wanted	to	provide	that	seed	.
Other	people	,	like	David	Packard	and	Julie	Packard	,	who	were	instrumental	in	producing	the	Monterey	Bay	aquarium	to	lock	into	people	's	notion	that	the	ocean	and	the	health	of	the	ocean	ecosystem	were	just	as	important	to	the	economy	of	this	area	as	eating	the	ecosystem	would	be	.
That	change	in	thinking	has	led	to	a	dramatic	shift	,	not	only	in	the	fortunes	of	Monterey	Bay	,	but	other	places	around	the	world	.
Well	,	I	want	to	leave	you	with	the	thought	that	what	we	're	really	trying	to	do	here	is	protect	this	ocean	pyramid	,	and	that	ocean	pyramid	connects	to	our	own	pyramid	of	life	.
It	's	an	ocean	planet	,	and	we	think	of	ourselves	as	a	terrestrial	species	,	but	the	pyramid	of	life	in	the	ocean	and	our	own	lives	on	land	are	intricately	connected	.
And	it	's	only	through	having	the	ocean	being	healthy	that	we	can	remain	healthy	ourselves	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

In	today	's	world	,	balancing	school	,	work	,	kids	and	more	,	most	of	us	can	only	hope	for	the	recommended	eight	hours	of	sleep	.	Examining	the	science	behind	our	body	's	internal	clock	,	Jessa	Gamble	reveals	the	surprising	and	substantial	program	of	rest	we	should	be	observing	.
evolution	,	humanity	,	personal	growth	,	science	,	self
957
Jessa	Gamble	:	Our	natural	sleep	cycle
Let	's	start	with	day	and	night	.
Life	evolved	under	conditions	of	light	and	darkness	,	light	and	then	darkness	.
And	so	plants	and	animals	developed	their	own	internal	clocks	so	that	they	would	be	ready	for	these	changes	in	light	.
These	are	chemical	clocks	,	and	they	're	found	in	every	known	being	that	has	two	or	more	cells	and	in	some	that	only	have	one	cell	.
I	'll	give	you	an	example	--	if	you	take	a	horseshoe	crab	off	the	beach	,	and	you	fly	it	all	the	way	across	the	continent	,	and	you	drop	it	into	a	sloped	cage	,	it	will	scramble	up	the	floor	of	the	cage	as	the	tide	is	rising	on	its	home	shores	,	and	it	'll	skitter	down	again	right	as	the	water	is	receding	thousands	of	miles	away	.
It	'll	do	this	for	weeks	,	until	it	kind	of	gradually	loses	the	plot	.
And	it	's	incredible	to	watch	,	but	there	's	nothing	psychic	or	paranormal	going	on	;	it	's	simply	that	these	crabs	have	internal	cycles	that	correspond	,	usually	,	with	what	's	going	on	around	it	.
So	,	we	have	this	ability	as	well	.
And	in	humans	,	we	call	it	the	``	body	clock	.	''
You	can	see	this	most	clearly	when	you	take	away	someone	's	watch	and	you	shut	them	into	a	bunker	,	deep	underground	,	for	a	couple	of	months	.
People	actually	volunteer	for	this	,	and	they	usually	come	out	kind	of	raving	about	their	productive	time	in	the	hole	.
So	,	no	matter	how	atypical	these	subjects	would	have	to	be	,	they	all	show	the	same	thing	.
They	get	up	just	a	little	bit	later	every	day	--	say	15	minutes	or	so	--	and	they	kind	of	drift	all	the	way	around	the	clock	like	this	over	the	course	of	the	weeks	.
And	so	,	in	this	way	we	know	that	they	are	working	on	their	own	internal	clocks	,	rather	than	somehow	sensing	the	day	outside	.
So	fine	,	we	have	a	body	clock	,	and	it	turns	out	that	it	's	incredibly	important	in	our	lives	.
It	's	a	huge	driver	for	culture	and	I	think	that	it	's	the	most	underrated	force	on	our	behavior	.
We	evolved	as	a	species	near	the	equator	,	and	so	we	're	very	well-equipped	to	deal	with	12	hours	of	daylight	and	12	hours	of	darkness	.
But	of	course	,	we	've	spread	to	every	corner	of	the	globe	and	in	Arctic	Canada	,	where	I	live	,	we	have	perpetual	daylight	in	summer	and	24	hours	of	darkness	in	winter	.
So	the	culture	,	the	northern	aboriginal	culture	,	traditionally	has	been	highly	seasonal	.
In	winter	,	there	's	a	lot	of	sleeping	going	on	;	you	enjoy	your	family	life	inside	.
And	in	summer	,	it	's	almost	manic	hunting	and	working	activity	very	long	hours	,	very	active	.
So	,	what	would	our	natural	rhythm	look	like	?
What	would	our	sleeping	patterns	be	in	the	sort	of	ideal	sense	?
Well	,	it	turns	out	that	when	people	are	living	without	any	sort	of	artificial	light	at	all	,	they	sleep	twice	every	night	.
They	go	to	bed	around	8:00	p.m	.
until	midnight	and	then	again	,	they	sleep	from	about	2:00	a.m.	until	sunrise	.
And	in-between	,	they	have	a	couple	of	hours	of	sort	of	meditative	quiet	in	bed	.
And	during	this	time	,	there	's	a	surge	of	prolactin	,	the	likes	of	which	a	modern	day	never	sees	.
The	people	in	these	studies	report	feeling	so	awake	during	the	daytime	,	that	they	realize	they	're	experiencing	true	wakefulness	for	the	first	time	in	their	lives	.
So	,	cut	to	the	modern	day	.
We	're	living	in	a	culture	of	jet	lag	,	global	travel	,	24-hour	business	,	shift	work	.
And	you	know	,	our	modern	ways	of	doing	things	have	their	advantages	,	but	I	believe	we	should	understand	the	costs	.
Thank	you	.

Mihaly	Csikszentmihalyi	on	flow
I	grew	up	in	Europe	,	and	World	War	II	caught	me	when	I	was	between	seven	and	10	years	old	.
And	I	realized	how	few	of	the	grown-ups	that	I	knew	were	able	to	withstand	the	tragedies	that	the	war	visited	on	them	--	how	few	of	them	could	even	resemble	a	normal	,	contented	,	satisfied	,	happy	life	once	their	job	,	their	home	,	their	security	was	destroyed	by	the	war	.
So	I	became	interested	in	understanding	what	contributed	to	a	life	that	was	worth	living	.
And	I	tried	,	as	a	child	,	as	a	teenager	,	to	read	philosophy	and	to	get	involved	in	art	and	religion	and	many	other	ways	that	I	could	see	as	a	possible	answer	to	that	question	.
And	finally	I	ended	up	encountering	psychology	by	chance	.
I	was	at	a	ski	resort	in	Switzerland	without	any	money	to	actually	enjoy	myself	,	because	the	snow	had	melted	and	I	did	n't	have	money	to	go	to	a	movie	.	But	I	found	that	on	the	--	I	read	in	the	newspapers	that	there	was	to	be	a	presentation	by	someone	in	a	place	that	I	'd	seen	in	the	center	of	Zurich	,	and	it	was	about	flying	saucers	[	that	]	he	was	going	to	talk	.
And	I	thought	,	well	,	since	I	ca	n't	go	to	the	movies	,	at	least	I	will	go	for	free	to	listen	to	flying	saucers	.
And	the	man	who	talked	at	that	evening	lecture	was	very	interesting	.
Instead	of	talking	about	little	green	men	,	he	talked	about	how	the	psyche	of	the	Europeans	had	been	traumatized	by	the	war	,	and	now	they	're	projecting	flying	saucers	into	the	sky	.
He	talked	about	how	the	mandalas	of	ancient	Hindu	religion	were	kind	of	projected	into	the	sky	as	an	attempt	to	regain	some	sense	of	order	after	the	chaos	of	war	.
And	this	seemed	very	interesting	to	me	.
And	I	started	reading	his	books	after	that	lecture	.
And	that	was	Carl	Jung	,	whose	name	or	work	I	had	no	idea	about	.
Then	I	came	to	this	country	to	study	psychology	and	I	started	trying	to	understand	the	roots	of	happiness	.
This	is	a	typical	result	that	many	people	have	presented	,	and	there	are	many	variations	on	it	.
But	this	,	for	instance	,	shows	that	about	30	percent	of	the	people	surveyed	in	the	United	States	since	1956	say	that	their	life	is	very	happy	.
And	that	has	n't	changed	at	all	.
Whereas	the	personal	income	,	on	a	scale	that	has	been	held	constant	to	accommodate	for	inflation	,	has	more	than	doubled	,	almost	tripled	,	in	that	period	.
But	you	find	essentially	the	same	results	,	namely	,	that	after	a	certain	basic	point	--	which	corresponds	more	or	less	to	just	a	few	1,000	dollars	above	the	minimum	poverty	level	--	increases	in	material	well-being	do	n't	seem	to	affect	how	happy	people	are	.
In	fact	,	you	can	find	that	the	lack	of	basic	resources	,	material	resources	,	contributes	to	unhappiness	,	but	the	increase	in	material	resources	does	not	increase	happiness	.
So	my	research	has	been	focused	more	on	--	after	finding	out	these	things	that	actually	corresponded	to	my	own	experience	,	I	tried	to	understand	:	where	--	in	everyday	life	,	in	our	normal	experience	--	do	we	feel	really	happy	?
And	to	start	those	studies	about	40	years	ago	,	I	began	to	look	at	creative	people	--	first	artists	and	scientists	,	and	so	forth	--	trying	to	understand	what	made	them	feel	that	it	was	worth	essentially	spending	their	life	doing	things	for	which	many	of	them	did	n't	expect	either	fame	or	fortune	,	but	which	made	their	life	meaningful	and	worth	doing	.
This	was	one	of	the	leading	composers	of	American	music	back	in	the	'70s	.
And	the	interview	was	40	pages	long	.
But	this	little	excerpt	is	a	very	good	summary	of	what	he	was	saying	during	the	interview	.
And	it	describes	how	he	feels	when	composing	is	going	well	.
And	he	says	by	describing	it	as	an	ecstatic	state	.
Now	,	``	ecstasy	''	in	Greek	meant	simply	to	stand	to	the	side	of	something	.
And	then	it	became	essentially	an	analogy	for	a	mental	state	where	you	feel	that	you	are	not	doing	your	ordinary	everyday	routines	.
So	ecstasy	is	essentially	a	stepping	into	an	alternative	reality	.
And	it	's	interesting	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	how	,	when	we	think	about	the	civilizations	that	we	look	up	to	as	having	been	pinnacles	of	human	achievement	--	whether	it	's	China	,	Greece	,	the	Hindu	civilization	,	or	the	Mayas	,	or	Egyptians	--	what	we	know	about	them	is	really	about	their	ecstasies	,	not	about	their	everyday	life	.
We	know	the	temples	they	built	,	where	people	could	come	to	experience	a	different	reality	.
We	know	about	the	circuses	,	the	arenas	,	the	theaters	.
These	are	the	remains	of	civilizations	and	they	are	the	places	that	people	went	to	experience	life	in	a	more	concentrated	,	more	ordered	form	.
Now	,	this	man	does	n't	need	to	go	to	a	place	like	this	,	which	is	also	--	this	place	,	this	arena	,	which	is	built	like	a	Greek	amphitheatre	,	is	a	place	for	ecstasy	also	.
We	are	participating	in	a	reality	that	is	different	from	that	of	the	everyday	life	that	we	're	used	to	.
But	this	man	does	n't	need	to	go	there	.
He	needs	just	a	piece	of	paper	where	he	can	put	down	little	marks	,	and	as	he	does	that	,	he	can	imagine	sounds	that	had	not	existed	before	in	that	particular	combination	.
So	once	he	gets	to	that	point	of	beginning	to	create	,	like	Jennifer	did	in	her	improvisation	,	a	new	reality	--	that	is	,	a	moment	of	ecstasy	--	he	enters	that	different	reality	.
Now	he	says	also	that	this	is	so	intense	an	experience	that	it	feels	almost	as	if	he	did	n't	exist	.
And	that	sounds	like	a	kind	of	a	romantic	exaggeration	.
But	actually	,	our	nervous	system	is	incapable	of	processing	more	than	about	110	bits	of	information	per	second	.
And	in	order	to	hear	me	and	understand	what	I	'm	saying	,	you	need	to	process	about	60	bits	per	second	.
That	's	why	you	ca	n't	hear	more	than	two	people	.
You	ca	n't	understand	more	than	two	people	talking	to	you	.
Well	,	when	you	are	really	involved	in	this	completely	engaging	process	of	creating	something	new	,	as	this	man	is	,	he	does	n't	have	enough	attention	left	over	to	monitor	how	his	body	feels	,	or	his	problems	at	home	.
He	ca	n't	feel	even	that	he	's	hungry	or	tired	.
His	body	disappears	,	his	identity	disappears	from	his	consciousness	,	because	he	does	n't	have	enough	attention	,	like	none	of	us	do	,	to	really	do	well	something	that	requires	a	lot	of	concentration	,	and	at	the	same	time	to	feel	that	he	exists	.
So	existence	is	temporarily	suspended	.
And	he	says	that	his	hand	seems	to	be	moving	by	itself	.
Now	,	I	could	look	at	my	hand	for	two	weeks	,	and	I	would	n't	feel	any	awe	or	wonder	,	because	I	ca	n't	compose	.
So	what	it	's	telling	you	here	is	that	obviously	this	automatic	,	spontaneous	process	that	he	's	describing	can	only	happen	to	someone	who	is	very	well	trained	and	who	has	developed	technique	.
And	it	has	become	a	kind	of	a	truism	in	the	study	of	creativity	that	you	ca	n't	be	creating	anything	with	less	than	10	years	of	technical-knowledge	immersion	in	a	particular	field	.
Whether	it	's	mathematics	or	music	,	it	takes	that	long	to	be	able	to	begin	to	change	something	in	a	way	that	it	's	better	than	what	was	there	before	.
Now	,	when	that	happens	,	he	says	the	music	just	flows	out	.
And	because	all	of	these	people	I	started	interviewing	--	this	was	an	interview	which	is	over	30	years	old	--	so	many	of	the	people	described	this	as	a	spontaneous	flow	that	I	called	this	type	of	experience	the	``	flow	experience	.	''
And	it	happens	in	different	realms	.
For	instance	,	a	poet	describes	it	in	this	form	.
This	is	by	a	student	of	mine	who	interviewed	some	of	the	leading	writers	and	poets	in	the	United	States	.
And	it	describes	the	same	effortless	,	spontaneous	feeling	that	you	get	when	you	enter	into	this	ecstatic	state	.
This	poet	describes	it	as	opening	a	door	that	floats	in	the	sky	--	a	very	similar	description	to	what	Albert	Einstein	gave	as	to	how	he	imagined	the	forces	of	relativity	,	when	he	was	struggling	with	trying	to	understand	how	it	worked	.
But	it	happens	in	other	activities	.
For	instance	,	this	is	another	student	of	mine	,	Susan	Jackson	from	Australia	,	who	did	work	with	some	of	the	leading	athletes	in	the	world	.
And	you	see	here	in	this	description	of	an	Olympic	skater	,	the	same	essential	description	of	the	phenomenology	of	the	inner	state	of	the	person	.
You	do	n't	think	;	it	goes	automatically	,	if	you	merge	yourself	with	the	music	,	and	so	forth	.
It	happens	also	,	actually	,	in	the	most	recent	book	I	wrote	,	called	``	Good	Business	,	''	where	I	interviewed	some	of	the	CEOs	who	had	been	nominated	by	their	peers	as	being	both	very	successful	and	very	ethical	,	very	socially	responsible	.
You	see	that	these	people	define	success	as	something	that	helps	others	and	at	the	same	time	makes	you	feel	happy	as	you	are	working	at	it	.
And	like	all	of	these	successful	and	responsible	CEOs	say	,	you	ca	n't	have	just	one	of	these	things	be	successful	if	you	want	a	meaningful	and	successful	job	.
Anita	Roddick	is	another	one	of	these	CEOs	we	interviewed	.
She	is	the	founder	of	Body	Shop	,	the	natural	cosmetics	king	.
It	's	kind	of	a	passion	that	comes	from	doing	the	best	and	having	flow	while	you	're	working	.
This	is	an	interesting	little	quote	from	Masaru	Ibuka	,	who	was	at	that	time	starting	out	Sony	without	any	money	,	without	a	product	--	they	did	n't	have	a	product	,	they	did	n't	have	anything	,	but	they	had	an	idea	.
And	the	idea	he	had	was	to	establish	a	place	of	work	where	engineers	can	feel	the	joy	of	technological	innovation	,	be	aware	of	their	mission	to	society	and	work	to	their	heart	's	content	.
I	could	n't	improve	on	this	as	a	good	example	of	how	flow	enters	the	workplace	.
Now	,	when	we	do	studies	--	we	have	,	with	other	colleagues	around	the	world	,	done	over	8,000	interviews	of	people	--	from	Dominican	monks	,	to	blind	nuns	,	to	Himalayan	climbers	,	to	Navajo	shepherds	--	who	enjoy	their	work	.
And	regardless	of	the	culture	,	regardless	of	education	or	whatever	,	there	are	these	seven	conditions	that	seem	to	be	there	when	a	person	is	in	flow	.
There	's	this	focus	that	,	once	it	becomes	intense	,	leads	to	a	sense	of	ecstasy	,	a	sense	of	clarity	:	you	know	exactly	what	you	want	to	do	from	one	moment	to	the	other	;	you	get	immediate	feedback	.
You	know	that	what	you	need	to	do	is	possible	to	do	,	even	though	difficult	,	and	sense	of	time	disappears	,	you	forget	yourself	,	you	feel	part	of	something	larger	.
And	once	the	conditions	are	present	,	what	you	are	doing	becomes	worth	doing	for	its	own	sake	.
In	our	studies	,	we	represent	the	everyday	life	of	people	in	this	simple	scheme	.
And	we	can	measure	this	very	precisely	,	actually	,	because	we	give	people	electronic	pagers	that	go	off	10	times	a	day	,	and	whenever	they	go	off	you	say	what	you	're	doing	,	how	you	feel	,	where	you	are	,	what	you	're	thinking	about	.
And	two	things	that	we	measure	is	the	amount	of	challenge	people	experience	at	that	moment	and	the	amount	of	skill	that	they	feel	they	have	at	that	moment	.
So	for	each	person	we	can	establish	an	average	,	which	is	the	center	of	the	diagram	.
That	would	be	your	mean	level	of	challenge	and	skill	,	which	will	be	different	from	that	of	anybody	else	.
But	you	have	a	kind	of	a	set	point	there	,	which	would	be	in	the	middle	.
If	we	know	what	that	set	point	is	,	we	can	predict	fairly	accurately	when	you	will	be	in	flow	,	and	it	will	be	when	your	challenges	are	higher	than	average	and	skills	are	higher	than	average	.
And	you	may	be	doing	things	very	differently	from	other	people	,	but	for	everyone	that	flow	channel	,	that	area	there	,	will	be	when	you	are	doing	what	you	really	like	to	do	--	play	the	piano	,	be	with	your	best	friend	,	perhaps	work	,	if	work	is	what	provides	flow	for	you	.
And	then	the	other	areas	become	less	and	less	positive	.
Arousal	is	still	good	because	you	are	over-challenged	there	.
Your	skills	are	not	quite	as	high	as	they	should	be	,	but	you	can	move	into	flow	fairly	easily	by	just	developing	a	little	more	skill	.
So	,	arousal	is	the	area	where	most	people	learn	from	,	because	that	's	where	they	're	pushed	beyond	their	comfort	zone	and	to	enter	that	--	going	back	to	flow	--	then	they	develop	higher	skills	.
Control	is	also	a	good	place	to	be	,	because	there	you	feel	comfortable	,	but	not	very	excited	.
It	's	not	very	challenging	any	more	.
And	if	you	want	to	enter	flow	from	control	,	you	have	to	increase	the	challenges	.
So	those	two	are	ideal	and	complementary	areas	from	which	flow	is	easy	to	go	into	.
The	other	combinations	of	challenge	and	skill	become	progressively	less	optimal	.
Relaxation	is	fine	--	you	still	feel	OK	.
Boredom	begins	to	be	very	aversive	and	apathy	becomes	very	negative	:	you	do	n't	feel	that	you	're	doing	anything	,	you	do	n't	use	your	skills	,	there	's	no	challenge	.
Unfortunately	,	a	lot	of	people	's	experience	is	in	apathy	.
The	largest	single	contributor	to	that	experience	is	watching	television	;	the	next	one	is	being	in	the	bathroom	,	sitting	.
Even	though	sometimes	watching	television	about	seven	to	eight	percent	of	the	time	is	in	flow	,	but	that	's	when	you	choose	a	program	you	really	want	to	watch	and	you	get	feedback	from	it	.
So	the	question	we	are	trying	to	address	--	and	I	'm	way	over	time	--	is	how	to	put	more	and	more	of	everyday	life	in	that	flow	channel	.
And	that	is	the	kind	of	challenge	that	we	're	trying	to	understand	.
And	some	of	you	obviously	know	how	to	do	that	spontaneously	without	any	advice	,	but	unfortunately	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	.
And	that	's	what	our	mandate	is	,	in	a	way	,	to	do	.
Thank	you	.

Yves	Behar	's	supercharged	motorcycle	design
Forrest	North	:	The	beginning	of	any	collaboration	starts	with	a	conversation	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	some	of	the	bits	of	the	conversation	that	we	started	with	.
I	grew	up	in	a	log	cabin	in	Washington	state	with	too	much	time	on	my	hands	.
Yves	Behar	:	And	in	scenic	Switzerland	for	me	.
FN	:	I	always	had	a	passion	for	alternative	vehicles	.
This	is	a	land	yacht	racing	across	the	desert	in	Nevada	.
YB	:	Combination	of	windsurfing	and	skiing	into	this	invention	there	.
FN	:	And	I	also	had	an	interest	in	dangerous	inventions	.
This	is	a	100,000-volt	Tesla	coil	that	I	built	in	my	bedroom	,	much	to	the	dismay	of	my	mother	.
YB	:	To	the	dismay	of	my	mother	,	this	is	dangerous	teenage	fashion	right	there	.
FN	:	And	I	brought	this	all	together	,	this	passion	with	alternative	energy	and	raced	a	solar	car	across	Australia	--	also	the	U.S.	and	Japan	.
YB	:	So	,	wind	power	,	solar	power	--	we	had	a	lot	to	talk	about	.
We	had	a	lot	that	got	us	excited	.
So	we	decided	to	do	a	special	project	together	.
To	combine	engineering	and	design	and	...
FN	:	Really	make	a	fully	integrated	product	,	something	beautiful	.
YB	:	And	we	made	a	baby	.
FN	:	Can	you	bring	out	our	baby	?
This	baby	is	fully	electric	.
It	goes	150	miles	an	hour	.
It	's	twice	the	range	of	any	electric	motorcycle	.
Really	the	exciting	thing	about	a	motorcycle	is	just	the	beautiful	integration	of	engineering	and	design	.
It	's	got	an	amazing	user	experience	.
It	was	wonderful	working	with	Yves	Behar	.
He	came	up	with	our	name	and	logo	.	We	're	Mission	Motors	.
And	we	've	only	got	three	minutes	,	but	we	could	talk	about	it	for	hours	.
YB	:	Thank	you	.
FN	:	Thank	you	TED	.	And	thank	you	Chris	,	for	having	us	.

In	this	uplifting	talk	,	Katherine	Fulton	sketches	the	new	future	of	philanthropy	--	one	where	collaboration	and	innovation	allow	regular	people	to	do	big	things	,	even	when	money	is	scarce	.	Giving	five	practical	examples	of	crowd-driven	philanthropy	,	she	calls	for	a	new	generation	of	citizen	leaders	.

Katherine	Fulton	:	You	are	the	future	of	philanthropy
I	want	to	help	you	re-perceive	what	philanthropy	is	,	what	it	could	be	,	and	what	your	relationship	to	it	is	.
And	in	doing	that	,	I	want	to	offer	you	a	vision	,	an	imagined	future	,	if	you	will	,	of	how	,	as	the	poet	Seamus	Heaney	has	put	it	,	``	Once	in	a	lifetime	the	longed-for	tidal	wave	of	justice	can	rise	up	,	and	hope	and	history	rhyme	.	''
I	want	to	start	with	these	word	pairs	here	.
We	all	know	which	side	of	these	we	'd	like	to	be	on	.
When	philanthropy	was	reinvented	a	century	ago	,	when	the	foundation	form	was	actually	invented	,	they	did	n't	think	of	themselves	on	the	wrong	side	of	these	either	.
In	fact	they	would	never	have	thought	of	themselves	as	closed	and	set	in	their	ways	,	as	slow	to	respond	to	new	challenges	,	as	small	and	risk-averse	.
And	in	fact	they	were	n't	.	They	were	reinventing	charity	in	those	times	,	what	Rockefeller	called	``	the	business	of	benevolence	.	''
But	by	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	a	new	generation	of	critics	and	reformers	had	come	to	see	philanthropy	just	this	way	.
The	thing	to	watch	for	as	a	global	philanthropy	industry	comes	about	--	and	that	's	exactly	what	is	happening	--	is	how	the	aspiration	is	to	flip	these	old	assumptions	,	for	philanthropy	to	become	open	and	big	and	fast	and	connected	,	in	service	of	the	long	term	.
This	entrepreneurial	energy	is	emerging	from	many	quarters	.
And	it	's	driven	and	propelled	forward	by	new	leaders	,	like	many	of	the	people	here	,	by	new	tools	,	like	the	ones	we	've	seen	here	,	and	by	new	pressures	.
I	've	been	following	this	change	for	quite	a	while	now	,	and	participating	in	it	.
This	report	is	our	main	public	report	.
What	it	tells	is	the	story	of	how	today	actually	could	be	as	historic	as	100	years	ago	.
What	I	want	to	do	is	share	some	of	the	coolest	things	that	are	going	on	with	you	.
And	as	I	do	that	,	I	'm	not	going	to	dwell	much	on	the	very	large	philanthropy	that	everybody	already	knows	about	--	the	Gates	or	the	Soros	or	the	Google	.
Instead	,	what	I	want	to	do	is	talk	about	the	philanthropy	of	all	of	us	:	the	democratization	of	philanthropy	.
This	is	a	moment	in	history	when	the	average	person	has	more	power	than	at	any	time	.
What	I	'm	going	to	do	is	look	at	five	categories	of	experiments	,	each	of	which	challenges	an	old	assumption	of	philanthropy	.
The	first	is	mass	collaboration	,	represented	here	by	Wikipedia	.
Now	,	this	may	surprise	you	.
But	remember	,	philanthropy	is	about	giving	of	time	and	talent	,	not	just	money	.
Clay	Shirky	,	that	great	chronicler	of	everything	networked	,	has	captured	the	assumption	that	this	challenges	in	such	a	beautiful	way	.
He	said	,	``	We	have	lived	in	this	world	where	little	things	are	done	for	love	and	big	things	for	money	.
Now	we	have	Wikipedia	.
Suddenly	big	things	can	be	done	for	love	.	''
Watch	,	this	spring	,	for	Paul	Hawken	's	new	book	--	Author	and	entrepreneur	many	of	you	may	know	about	.
The	book	is	called	``	Blessed	Unrest	.	''
And	when	it	comes	out	,	a	series	of	wiki	sites	under	the	label	WISER	,	are	going	to	launch	at	the	same	time	.
WISER	stands	for	World	Index	for	Social	and	Environmental	Responsibility	.
WISER	sets	out	to	document	,	link	and	empower	what	Paul	calls	the	largest	movement	,	and	fastest-growing	movement	in	human	history	:	humanity	's	collective	immune	response	to	today	's	threats	.
Now	,	all	of	these	big	things	for	love	--	experiments	--	are	n't	going	to	take	off	.
But	the	ones	that	do	are	going	to	be	the	biggest	,	the	most	open	,	the	fastest	,	the	most	connected	form	of	philanthropy	in	human	history	.
Second	category	is	online	philanthropy	marketplaces	.
This	is	,	of	course	,	to	philanthropy	what	eBay	and	Amazon	are	to	commerce	.
Think	of	it	as	peer-to-peer	philanthropy	.
And	this	challenges	yet	another	assumption	,	which	is	that	organized	philanthropy	is	only	for	the	very	wealthy	.
Take	a	look	,	if	you	have	n't	,	at	DonorsChoose	.
Omidyar	Network	has	made	a	big	investment	in	DonorsChoose	.
It	's	one	of	the	best	known	of	these	new	marketplaces	where	a	donor	can	go	straight	into	a	classroom	and	connect	with	what	a	teacher	says	they	need	.
Take	a	look	at	Changing	the	Present	,	started	by	a	TEDster	,	next	time	you	need	a	wedding	present	or	a	holiday	present	.
GiveIndia	is	for	a	whole	country	.
And	it	goes	on	and	on	.
The	third	category	is	represented	by	Warren	Buffet	,	which	I	call	aggregated	giving	.
It	's	not	just	that	Warren	Buffet	was	so	amazingly	generous	in	that	historic	act	last	summer	.
It	's	that	he	challenged	another	assumption	,	that	every	giver	should	have	his	or	her	own	fund	or	foundation	.
There	are	now	,	today	,	so	many	new	funds	that	are	aggregating	giving	and	investing	,	bringing	together	people	around	a	common	goal	,	to	think	bigger	.
One	of	the	best	known	is	Acumen	Fund	,	led	by	Jacqueline	Novogratz	,	a	TEDster	who	got	a	big	boost	here	at	TED	.
But	there	are	many	others	:	New	Profit	in	Cambridge	,	New	School	's	Venture	Fund	in	Silicon	Valley	,	Venture	Philanthropy	Partners	in	Washington	,	Global	Fund	for	Women	in	San	Francisco	.
Take	a	look	at	these	.
These	funds	are	to	philanthropy	what	venture	capital	,	private	equity	,	and	eventually	mutual	funds	are	to	investing	,	but	with	a	twist	--	because	often	a	community	forms	around	these	funds	,	as	it	has	at	Acumen	and	other	places	.
Now	,	imagine	for	a	second	these	first	three	types	of	experiments	:	mass	collaboration	,	online	marketplaces	,	aggregated	giving	.
And	understand	how	they	help	us	re-perceive	what	organized	philanthropy	is	.
It	's	not	about	foundations	necessarily	;	it	's	about	the	rest	of	us	.
And	imagine	the	mash-up	,	if	you	will	,	of	these	things	,	in	the	future	,	when	these	things	come	together	in	the	experiments	of	the	future	--	imagine	that	somebody	puts	up	,	say	,	100	million	dollars	for	an	inspiring	goal	--	there	were	21	gifts	of	100	million	dollars	or	more	in	the	US	last	year	,	not	out	of	the	question	--	but	only	puts	it	up	if	it	's	matched	by	millions	of	small	gifts	from	around	the	globe	,	thereby	engaging	lots	of	people	,	and	building	visibility	and	engaging	people	in	the	goal	that	's	stated	.
I	'm	going	to	look	quickly	at	the	fourth	and	fifth	categories	,	which	are	innovation	,	competitions	and	social	investing	.
They	're	betting	a	visible	competition	,	a	prize	,	can	attract	talent	and	money	to	some	of	the	most	difficult	issues	,	and	thereby	speed	the	solution	.
This	tackles	yet	another	assumption	,	that	the	giver	and	the	organization	is	at	the	center	,	as	opposed	to	putting	the	problem	at	the	center	.
You	can	look	to	these	innovators	to	help	us	especially	with	things	that	require	technological	or	scientific	solution	.
That	leaves	the	final	category	,	social	investing	,	which	is	really	,	anyway	,	the	biggest	of	them	all	,	represented	here	by	Xigi.net	.
And	this	,	of	course	,	tackles	the	biggest	assumption	of	all	,	that	business	is	business	,	and	philanthropy	is	the	vehicle	of	people	who	want	to	create	change	in	the	world	.
Xigi	is	a	new	community	site	that	's	built	by	the	community	,	linking	and	mapping	this	new	social	capital	market	.
It	lists	already	1,000	entities	that	are	offering	debt	and	equity	for	social	enterprise	.
So	we	can	look	to	these	innovators	to	help	us	remember	that	if	we	can	leverage	even	a	small	amount	of	the	capital	that	seeks	a	return	,	the	good	that	can	be	driven	could	be	astonishing	.
Now	,	what	's	really	interesting	here	is	that	we	're	not	thinking	our	way	into	a	new	way	of	acting	;	we	're	acting	our	way	into	a	new	way	of	thinking	.
Philanthropy	is	reorganizing	itself	before	our	very	eyes	.
And	even	though	all	of	the	experiments	and	all	of	the	big	givers	do	n't	yet	fulfill	this	aspiration	,	I	think	this	is	the	new	zeitgeist	:	open	,	big	,	fast	,	connected	,	and	,	let	us	also	hope	,	long	.
We	have	got	to	realize	that	it	is	going	to	take	a	long	time	to	do	these	things	.
If	we	do	n't	develop	the	stamina	to	stick	with	things	--	whatever	it	is	you	pick	,	stick	with	it	--	all	of	this	stuff	is	just	going	to	be	,	you	know	,	a	fad	.
But	I	'm	really	hopeful	.
And	I	'm	hopeful	because	it	's	not	only	philanthropy	that	's	reorganizing	itself	,	it	's	also	whole	other	portions	of	the	social	sector	,	and	of	business	,	that	are	busy	challenging	``	business	as	usual	.	''
And	everywhere	I	go	,	including	here	at	TED	,	I	feel	that	there	is	a	new	moral	hunger	that	is	growing	.
What	we	're	seeing	is	people	really	wrestling	to	describe	what	is	this	new	thing	that	's	happening	.
Words	like	``	philanthrocapitalism	,	''	and	``	natural	capitalism	,	''	and	``	philanthroentrepreneur	,	''	and	``	venture	philanthropy	.	''
We	do	n't	have	a	language	for	it	yet	.
Whatever	we	call	it	,	it	's	new	,	it	's	beginning	,	and	I	think	it	's	gong	to	quite	significant	.
And	that	's	where	my	imagined	future	comes	in	,	which	I	am	going	to	call	the	social	singularity	.
Many	of	you	will	realize	that	I	'm	ripping	a	bit	off	of	the	science	fiction	writer	Vernor	Vinge	's	notion	of	a	technological	singularity	,	where	a	number	of	trends	accelerate	and	converge	and	come	together	to	create	,	really	,	a	shockingly	new	reality	.
It	may	be	that	the	social	singularity	ahead	is	the	one	that	we	fear	the	most	:	a	convergence	of	catastrophes	,	of	environmental	degradation	,	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	,	of	pandemics	,	of	poverty	.
That	's	because	our	ability	to	confront	the	problems	that	we	face	has	not	kept	pace	with	our	ability	to	create	them	.
And	as	we	've	heard	here	,	it	is	no	exaggeration	to	say	that	we	hold	the	future	of	our	civilization	in	our	hands	as	never	before	.
The	question	is	,	is	there	a	positive	social	singularity	?
Is	there	a	frontier	for	us	of	how	we	live	together	?
Our	future	does	n't	have	to	be	imagined	.
We	can	create	a	future	where	hope	and	history	rhyme	.
But	we	have	a	problem	.
Our	experience	to	date	,	both	individually	and	collectively	,	has	n't	prepared	us	for	what	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	,	or	who	we	're	going	to	need	to	be	.
We	are	going	to	need	a	new	generation	of	citizen	leaders	willing	to	commit	ourselves	to	growing	and	changing	and	learning	as	rapidly	as	possible	.
That	's	why	I	have	one	last	thing	I	want	to	show	you	.
This	is	a	photograph	taken	about	100	years	ago	of	my	grandfather	and	great-grandfather	.
This	is	a	newspaper	publisher	and	a	banker	.
And	they	were	great	community	leaders	.
And	,	yes	,	they	were	great	philanthropists	.
I	keep	this	photograph	close	by	to	me	--	it	's	in	my	office	--	because	I	've	always	felt	a	mystical	connection	to	these	two	men	,	both	of	whom	I	never	knew	.
And	so	,	in	their	honor	,	I	want	to	offer	you	this	blank	slide	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	this	a	photograph	of	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	think	about	the	community	that	you	want	to	be	part	of	creating	.
Whatever	that	means	to	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	it	's	100	years	from	now	,	and	your	grandchild	,	or	great-grandchild	,	or	niece	or	nephew	or	god-child	,	is	looking	at	this	photograph	of	you	.
What	is	the	story	you	most	want	for	them	to	tell	?
Thank	you	very	much	.

Hanna	Rosin	:	New	data	on	the	rise	of	women
We	are	now	going	through	an	amazing	and	unprecedented	moment	where	the	power	dynamics	between	men	and	women	are	shifting	very	rapidly	,	and	in	many	of	the	places	where	it	counts	the	most	,	women	are	,	in	fact	,	taking	control	of	everything	.
In	my	mother	's	day	,	she	did	n't	go	to	college	.
Not	a	lot	of	women	did	.
And	now	,	for	every	two	men	who	get	a	college	degree	,	three	women	will	do	the	same	.
Women	,	for	the	first	time	this	year	,	became	the	majority	of	the	American	workforce	.
And	they	're	starting	to	dominate	lots	of	professions	--	doctors	,	lawyers	,	bankers	,	accountants	.
Over	50	percent	of	managers	are	women	these	days	,	and	in	the	15	professions	projected	to	grow	the	most	in	the	next	decade	,	all	but	two	of	them	are	dominated	by	women	.
So	the	global	economy	is	becoming	a	place	where	women	are	more	successful	than	men	,	believe	it	or	not	,	and	these	economic	changes	are	starting	to	rapidly	affect	our	culture	--	what	our	romantic	comedies	look	like	,	what	our	marriages	look	like	,	what	our	dating	lives	look	like	,	and	our	new	set	of	superheroes	.
For	a	long	time	,	this	is	the	image	of	American	manhood	that	dominated	--	tough	,	rugged	,	in	control	of	his	own	environment	.
A	few	years	ago	,	the	Marlboro	Man	was	retired	and	replaced	by	this	much	less	impressive	specimen	,	who	is	a	parody	of	American	manhood	,	and	that	's	what	we	have	in	our	commercials	today	.
The	phrase	``	first-born	son	''	is	so	deeply	ingrained	in	our	consciousness	that	this	statistic	alone	shocked	me	.
In	American	fertility	clinics	,	75	percent	of	couples	are	requesting	girls	and	not	boys	.
And	in	places	where	you	would	n't	think	,	such	as	South	Korea	,	India	and	China	,	the	very	strict	patriarchal	societies	are	starting	to	break	down	a	little	,	and	families	are	no	longer	strongly	preferring	first-born	sons	.
If	you	think	about	this	,	if	you	just	open	your	eyes	to	this	possibility	and	start	to	connect	the	dots	,	you	can	see	the	evidence	everywhere	.
You	can	see	it	in	college	graduation	patterns	,	in	job	projections	,	in	our	marriage	statistics	,	you	can	see	it	in	the	Icelandic	elections	,	which	you	'll	hear	about	later	,	and	you	can	see	it	on	South	Korean	surveys	on	son	preference	,	that	something	amazing	and	unprecedented	is	happening	with	women	.
Certainly	this	is	not	the	first	time	that	we	've	had	great	progress	with	women	.
The	'20s	and	the	'60s	also	come	to	mind	.
But	the	difference	is	that	,	back	then	,	it	was	driven	by	a	very	passionate	feminist	movement	that	was	trying	to	project	its	own	desires	,	whereas	this	time	,	it	's	not	about	passion	,	and	it	's	not	about	any	kind	of	movement	.
This	is	really	just	about	the	facts	of	this	economic	moment	that	we	live	in	.
The	200,000-year	period	in	which	men	have	been	top	dog	is	truly	coming	to	an	end	,	believe	it	or	not	,	and	that	's	why	I	talk	about	the	``	end	of	men	.	''
Now	all	you	men	out	there	,	this	is	not	the	moment	where	you	tune	out	or	throw	some	tomatoes	,	because	the	point	is	that	this	is	happening	to	all	of	us	.
I	myself	have	a	husband	and	a	father	and	two	sons	whom	I	dearly	love	.
And	this	is	why	I	like	to	talk	about	this	,	because	if	we	do	n't	acknowledge	it	,	then	the	transition	will	be	pretty	painful	.
But	if	we	do	take	account	of	it	,	then	I	think	it	will	go	much	more	smoothly	.
I	first	started	thinking	about	this	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	.
I	was	reading	headlines	about	the	recession	just	like	anyone	else	,	and	I	started	to	notice	a	distinct	pattern	--	that	the	recession	was	affecting	men	much	more	deeply	than	it	was	affecting	women	.
And	I	remembered	back	to	about	10	years	ago	when	I	read	a	book	by	Susan	Faludi	called	``	Stiffed	:	The	Betrayal	of	the	American	Man	,	''	in	which	she	described	how	hard	the	recession	had	hit	men	,	and	I	started	to	think	about	whether	it	had	gotten	worse	this	time	around	in	this	recession	.
And	I	realized	that	two	things	were	different	this	time	around	.
The	first	was	that	these	were	no	longer	just	temporary	hits	that	the	recession	was	giving	men	--	that	this	was	reflecting	a	deeper	underlying	shift	in	our	global	economy	.
And	second	,	that	the	story	was	no	longer	just	about	the	crisis	of	men	,	but	it	was	also	about	what	was	happening	to	women	.
And	now	look	at	this	second	set	of	slides	.
These	are	headlines	about	what	's	been	going	on	with	women	in	the	next	few	years	.
These	are	things	we	never	could	have	imagined	a	few	years	ago	.
Women	,	a	majority	of	the	workplace	.
And	labor	statistics	:	women	take	up	most	managerial	jobs	.
This	second	set	of	headlines	--	you	can	see	that	families	and	marriages	are	starting	to	shift	.
And	look	at	that	last	headline	--	young	women	earning	more	than	young	men	.
That	particular	headline	comes	to	me	from	a	market	research	firm	.
They	were	basically	asked	by	one	of	their	clients	who	was	going	to	buy	houses	in	that	neighborhood	in	the	future	.
And	they	expected	that	it	would	be	young	families	,	or	young	men	,	just	like	it	had	always	been	.
But	in	fact	,	they	found	something	very	surprising	.
It	was	young	,	single	women	who	were	the	major	purchasers	of	houses	in	the	neighborhood	.
And	so	they	decided	,	because	they	were	intrigued	by	this	finding	,	to	do	a	nationwide	survey	.
So	they	spread	out	all	the	census	data	,	and	what	they	found	,	the	guy	described	to	me	as	a	shocker	,	which	is	that	in	1,997	out	of	2,000	communities	,	women	,	young	women	,	were	making	more	money	than	young	men	.
So	here	you	have	a	generation	of	young	women	who	grow	up	thinking	of	themselves	as	being	more	powerful	earners	than	the	young	men	around	them	.
Now	,	I	've	just	laid	out	the	picture	for	you	,	but	I	still	have	n't	explained	to	you	why	this	is	happening	.
And	in	a	moment	,	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	graph	,	and	what	you	'll	see	on	this	graph	--	it	begins	in	1973	,	just	before	women	start	flooding	the	workforce	,	and	it	brings	us	up	to	our	current	day	.
And	basically	what	you	'll	see	is	what	economists	talk	about	as	the	polarization	of	the	economy	.
Now	what	does	that	mean	?
It	means	that	the	economy	is	dividing	into	high-skill	,	high-wage	jobs	and	low-skill	,	low-wage	jobs	--	and	that	the	middle	,	the	middle-skill	jobs	,	and	the	middle-earning	jobs	,	are	starting	to	drop	out	of	the	economy	.
This	has	been	going	on	for	40	years	now	.
But	this	process	is	affecting	men	very	differently	than	it	's	affecting	women	.
You	'll	see	the	women	in	red	,	and	you	'll	see	the	men	in	blue	.
You	'll	watch	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	,	but	see	what	happens	to	women	and	see	what	happens	to	men	.
There	we	go	.
So	watch	that	.	You	see	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	.
Watch	what	happens	to	the	women	.	Watch	what	happens	to	the	men	.
The	men	sort	of	stagnate	there	,	while	the	women	zoom	up	in	those	high-skill	jobs	.
So	what	's	that	about	?
It	looks	like	women	got	some	power	boost	on	a	video	game	,	or	like	they	snuck	in	some	secret	serum	into	their	birth-control	pills	that	lets	them	shoot	up	high	.
But	of	course	,	it	's	not	about	that	.
What	it	's	about	is	that	the	economy	has	changed	a	lot	.
We	used	to	have	a	manufacturing	economy	,	which	was	about	building	goods	and	products	,	and	now	we	have	a	service	economy	and	an	information	and	creative	economy	.
Those	two	economies	require	very	different	skills	,	and	as	it	happens	,	women	have	been	much	better	at	acquiring	the	new	set	of	skills	than	men	have	been	.
It	used	to	be	that	you	were	a	guy	who	went	to	high	school	who	did	n't	have	a	college	degree	,	but	you	had	a	specific	set	of	skills	,	and	with	the	help	of	a	union	,	you	could	make	yourself	a	pretty	good	middle-class	life	.
But	that	really	is	n't	true	anymore	.
This	new	economy	is	pretty	indifferent	to	size	and	strength	,	which	is	what	's	helped	men	along	all	these	years	.
What	the	economy	requires	now	is	a	whole	different	set	of	skills	.
You	basically	need	intelligence	,	you	need	an	ability	to	sit	still	and	focus	,	to	communicate	openly	,	to	be	able	to	listen	to	people	and	to	operate	in	a	workplace	that	is	much	more	fluid	than	it	used	to	be	,	and	those	are	things	that	women	do	extremely	well	,	as	we	're	seeing	.
If	you	look	at	management	theory	these	days	,	it	used	to	be	that	our	ideal	leader	sounded	something	like	General	Patton	,	right	?
You	would	be	issuing	orders	from	above	.
You	would	be	very	hierarchical	.
You	would	tell	everyone	below	you	what	to	do	.
But	that	's	not	what	an	ideal	leader	is	like	now	.
If	you	read	management	books	now	,	a	leader	is	somebody	who	can	foster	creativity	,	who	can	get	his	--	get	the	employees	--	see	,	I	still	say	``	his	''	--	who	can	get	the	employees	to	talk	to	each	other	,	who	can	basically	build	teams	and	get	them	to	be	creative	.
And	those	are	all	things	that	women	do	very	well	.
And	then	on	top	of	that	,	that	's	created	a	kind	of	cascading	effect	.
Women	enter	the	workplace	at	the	top	,	and	then	at	the	working	class	,	all	the	new	jobs	that	are	created	are	the	kinds	of	jobs	that	wives	used	to	do	for	free	at	home	.
So	that	's	childcare	,	elder	care	and	food	preparation	.
So	those	are	all	the	jobs	that	are	growing	,	and	those	are	jobs	that	women	tend	to	do	.
Now	one	day	it	might	be	that	mothers	will	hire	an	out-of-work	,	middle-aged	,	former	steelworker	guy	to	watch	their	children	at	home	,	and	that	would	be	good	for	the	men	,	but	that	has	n't	quite	happened	yet	.
To	see	what	's	going	to	happen	,	you	ca	n't	just	look	at	the	workforce	that	is	now	,	you	have	to	look	at	our	future	workforce	.
And	here	the	story	is	fairly	simple	.
Women	are	getting	college	degrees	at	a	faster	rate	than	men	.
Why	?	This	is	a	real	mystery	.
People	have	asked	men	,	why	do	n't	they	just	go	back	to	college	,	to	community	college	,	say	,	and	retool	themselves	,	learn	a	new	set	of	skills	?
Well	it	turns	out	that	they	're	just	very	uncomfortable	doing	that	.
They	're	used	to	thinking	of	themselves	as	providers	,	and	they	ca	n't	seem	to	build	the	social	networks	that	allow	them	to	get	through	college	.
So	for	some	reason	men	just	do	n't	end	up	going	back	to	college	.
And	what	's	even	more	disturbing	is	what	's	happening	with	younger	boys	.
There	's	been	about	a	decade	of	research	about	what	people	are	calling	the	``	boy	crisis	.	''
Now	the	boy	crisis	is	this	idea	that	very	young	boys	,	for	whatever	reason	,	are	doing	worse	in	school	than	very	young	girls	,	and	people	have	theories	about	that	.
Is	it	because	we	have	an	excessively	verbal	curriculum	,	and	little	girls	are	better	at	that	than	little	boys	?
Or	that	we	require	kids	to	sit	still	too	much	,	and	so	boys	initially	feel	like	failures	?
And	some	people	say	it	's	because	,	in	9th	grade	,	boys	start	dropping	out	of	school	.
Because	I	'm	writing	a	book	about	all	this	,	I	'm	still	looking	into	it	,	so	I	do	n't	have	the	answer	.
But	in	the	mean	time	,	I	'm	going	to	call	on	the	worldwide	education	expert	,	who	's	my	10-year-old	daughter	,	Noah	,	to	talk	to	you	about	why	the	boys	in	her	class	do	worse	.
Noah	:	The	girls	are	obviously	smarter	.
I	mean	they	have	much	larger	vocabulary	.
They	learn	much	faster	.
They	are	more	controlled	.
On	the	board	today	for	losing	recess	tomorrow	,	only	boys	.
Hanna	Rosin	:	And	why	is	that	?
Noah	:	Why	?	They	were	just	not	listening	to	the	class	while	the	girls	sat	there	very	nicely	.
HR	:	So	there	you	go	.
This	whole	thesis	really	came	home	to	me	when	I	went	to	visit	a	college	in	Kansas	City	--	working-class	college	.
Certainly	,	when	I	was	in	college	,	I	had	certain	expectations	about	my	life	--	that	my	husband	and	I	would	both	work	,	and	that	we	would	equally	raise	the	children	.
But	these	college	girls	had	a	completely	different	view	of	their	future	.
Basically	,	the	way	they	said	it	to	me	is	that	they	would	be	working	18	hours	a	day	,	that	their	husband	would	maybe	have	a	job	,	but	that	mostly	he	would	be	at	home	taking	care	of	the	kiddies	.
And	this	was	kind	of	a	shocker	to	me	.
And	then	here	's	my	favorite	quote	from	one	of	the	girls	:	``	Men	are	the	new	ball	and	chain	.	''
Now	you	laugh	,	but	that	quote	has	kind	of	a	sting	to	it	,	right	?
And	I	think	the	reason	it	has	a	sting	is	because	thousands	of	years	of	history	do	n't	reverse	themselves	without	a	lot	of	pain	,	and	that	's	why	I	talk	about	us	all	going	through	this	together	.
The	night	after	I	talked	to	these	college	girls	,	I	also	went	to	a	men	's	group	in	Kansas	,	and	these	were	exactly	the	kind	of	victims	of	the	manufacturing	economy	which	I	spoke	to	you	about	earlier	.
They	were	men	who	had	been	contractors	,	or	they	had	been	building	houses	and	they	had	lost	their	jobs	after	the	housing	boom	,	and	they	were	in	this	group	because	they	were	failing	to	pay	their	child	support	.
And	the	instructor	was	up	there	in	the	class	explaining	to	them	all	the	ways	in	which	they	had	lost	their	identity	in	this	new	age	.
He	was	telling	them	they	no	longer	had	any	moral	authority	,	that	nobody	needed	them	for	emotional	support	anymore	,	and	they	were	not	really	the	providers	.
So	who	were	they	?
And	this	was	very	disheartening	for	them	.
And	what	he	did	was	he	wrote	down	on	the	board	``	$	85,000	,	''	and	he	said	,	``	That	's	her	salary	,	''	and	then	he	wrote	down	``	$	12,000	.	''
``	That	's	your	salary	.
So	who	's	the	man	now	?	''	he	asked	them	.
``	Who	's	the	damn	man	?
She	's	the	man	now	.	''
And	that	really	sent	a	shudder	through	the	room	.
And	that	's	part	of	the	reason	I	like	to	talk	about	this	,	because	I	think	it	can	be	pretty	painful	,	and	we	really	have	to	work	through	it	.
And	the	other	reason	it	's	kind	of	urgent	is	because	it	's	not	just	happening	in	the	U.S	.
It	's	happening	all	over	the	world	.
In	India	,	poor	women	are	learning	English	faster	than	their	male	counterparts	in	order	to	staff	the	new	call	centers	that	are	growing	in	India	.
In	China	,	a	lot	of	the	opening	up	of	private	entrepreneurship	is	happening	because	women	are	starting	businesses	,	small	businesses	,	faster	than	men	.
And	here	's	my	favorite	example	,	which	is	in	South	Korea	.
Over	several	decades	,	South	Korea	built	one	of	the	most	patriarchal	societies	we	know	about	.
They	basically	enshrined	the	second-class	status	of	women	in	the	civil	code	.
And	if	women	failed	to	birth	male	children	,	they	were	basically	treated	like	domestic	servants	.
And	sometimes	family	would	pray	to	the	spirits	to	kill	off	a	girl	child	so	they	could	have	a	male	child	.
But	over	the	'70s	and	'80s	,	the	South	Korea	government	decided	they	wanted	to	rapidly	industrialize	,	and	so	what	they	did	was	,	they	started	to	push	women	into	the	workforce	.
Now	they	've	been	asking	a	question	since	1985	:	``	How	strongly	do	you	prefer	a	first-born	son	?	''
And	now	look	at	the	chart	.
That	's	from	1985	to	2003	.
How	much	do	you	prefer	a	first-born	son	?
So	you	can	see	that	these	economic	changes	really	do	have	a	strong	effect	on	our	culture	.
Now	because	we	have	n't	fully	processed	this	information	,	it	's	kind	of	coming	back	to	us	in	our	pop	culture	in	these	kind	of	weird	and	exaggerated	ways	,	where	you	can	see	that	the	stereotypes	are	changing	.
And	so	we	have	on	the	male	side	what	one	of	my	colleagues	likes	to	call	the	``	omega	males	''	popping	up	,	who	are	the	males	who	are	romantically	challenged	losers	who	ca	n't	find	a	job	.
And	they	come	up	in	lots	of	different	forms	.
So	we	have	the	perpetual	adolescent	.
We	have	the	charmless	misanthrope	.
Then	we	have	our	Bud	Light	guy	who	's	the	happy	couch	potato	.
And	then	here	's	a	shocker	:	even	America	's	most	sexiest	man	alive	,	the	sexiest	man	alive	gets	romantically	played	these	days	in	a	movie	.
And	then	on	the	female	side	,	you	have	the	opposite	,	in	which	you	have	these	crazy	superhero	women	.
You	've	got	Lady	Gaga	.
You	've	got	our	new	James	Bond	,	who	's	Angelina	Jolie	.
And	it	's	not	just	for	the	young	,	right	?
Even	Helen	Mirren	can	hold	a	gun	these	days	.
And	so	it	feels	like	we	have	to	move	from	this	place	where	we	've	got	these	uber-exaggerated	images	into	something	that	feels	a	little	more	normal	.
So	for	a	long	time	in	the	economic	sphere	,	we	've	lived	with	the	term	``	glass	ceiling	.	''
Now	I	've	never	really	liked	this	term	.
For	one	thing	,	it	puts	men	and	women	in	a	really	antagonistic	relationship	with	one	another	,	because	the	men	are	these	devious	tricksters	up	there	who	've	put	up	this	glass	ceiling	.
And	we	're	always	below	the	glass	ceiling	,	the	women	.
And	we	have	a	lot	of	skill	and	experience	,	but	it	's	a	trick	,	so	how	are	you	supposed	to	prepare	to	get	through	that	glass	ceiling	?
And	also	,	``	shattering	the	glass	ceiling	''	is	a	terrible	phrase	.
would	pop	their	head	through	a	glass	ceiling	?
So	the	image	that	I	like	to	think	of	,	instead	of	glass	ceiling	,	is	the	high	bridge	.
It	's	definitely	terrifying	to	stand	at	the	foot	of	a	high	bridge	,	but	it	's	also	pretty	exhilarating	,	because	it	's	beautiful	up	there	,	and	you	're	looking	out	on	a	beautiful	view	.
And	the	great	thing	is	there	's	no	trick	like	with	the	glass	ceiling	.
There	's	no	man	or	woman	standing	in	the	middle	about	to	cut	the	cables	.
